BACKGROUND. Previous reports based on small patient numbers suggested that
changes in serum HER-2/neu levels may predict response or lack of response to
trastuzumab-based therapies in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The objectives
of this study were to pool data from 307 patients with MBC from 7 medical institutions to validate that the serum HER-2/neu profile predicts patient resistance
to trastuzumab and to establish a clinically relevant cutoff.

METHODS. This was an international, multicenter, retrospective analysis of individual pooled data from 307 patients with MBC who were treated with first-line trastuzumab-based therapy. Serum was collected at baseline and 30 to 120 days after the
initiation of trastuzumab therapy. A serum HER-2/neu decrease 20% (receiver
operating curve analysis) was defined as a significant HER-2/neu change.

RESULTS. Of the 307 patients with MBC, 191 patients (62%) had a significant
decline (>20%) in serum HER-2/neu and 116 patients (38%) did not. The objective
response rate was 57% for patients who achieved this decline in serum HER-2/neu
(>20%) compared with 28% for patients who did not. Patients who achieved this
decline in serum HER-2/neu also had a significantly longer time to disease progression (320 days vs 180 days; P <.0001), longer duration of response (369 days vs 230
days; P 5.008), and longer overall survival (898 days vs 593 days; P <.018).

CONCLUSIONS. In this pooled analysis of 307 patients with MBC, individuals who
did not achieve a significant decline (20%) in serum HER-2/neu levels had
decreased benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy, and these patients should be
considered for clinical trials evaluating additional HER-2/neu-targeted interventions. Cancer 2008;113:1294–301.  2008 American Cancer Society.

T

he human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
proto-oncogene (HER-2, neu, ErbB-2) is a transmembrane receptor that has intracellular tyrosine
kinase activity.1,2 It is overexpressed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or amplified by fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in approximately
20% to 25% of invasive primary breast cancers1,3 and
is associated with a poor prognosis and more aggressive disease.4 The HER-2/neu extracellular domain
(ECD) is cleaved by the ADAM metalloproteinases,
and the remaining membrane-bound internal domain is activated constitutively.5 The ECD (p97-115
kD) of the HER-2/neu protein is released into the circulation, and serum HER-2/neu levels are elevated in
30% to 70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer
(MBC).6 Rising serum HER-2/neu concentrations
have been associated with progressive metastatic disease and a poor response to chemotherapy.7 Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that an elevated
pretreatment HER-2/neu level is associated with
decreased response to both first- and second-line endocrine therapy.8,9 Numerous studies also have
demonstrated that changes in serum HER-2/neu
levels parallel the clinical course of disease; and, in
several publications, rising levels were observed
before actual clinical diagnosis.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, South San
Francisco, Calif) was the first HER-2/neu-targeted
therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with
MBC. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the HER-2/neu ECD. Singleagent response rates range from 12% to 30%,
depending on the HER-2/neu status of the tumor
and the patient’s prior treatment.10,11 Trastuzumab
improves response rates, time to disease progression,
and survival in patients with MBC when it is added
to chemotherapy.12,13 It has been demonstrated that
trastuzumab is synergistic with a variety of commonly used chemotherapy agents, such as paclitaxel,
docetaxel, platinum salts, and vinorelbine.12-15
The most commonly used methods for selecting
patients for trastuzumab monoclonal antibody therapy are IHC and FISH.16 However, only 30% to 61%
of these patients will respond to trastuzumab-based
therapy. Studies also have indicated that the rise and
fall of serum HER-2/neu are correlated with the clinical course of disease in patients with MBC who have
received trastuzumab and chemotherapy.17-18 In a
2004 pilot study, Kostler et al demonstrated that a

significant decrease in serum HER-2/neu from the
pretreatment baseline level within 30 days after starting treatment was an early predictor of outcome after trastuzumab therapy.19 Subsequent reports from
Esteva et al,20 Fornier et al,21 Bethune-Volters et al,22
and Tse et al,23 using small numbers of patients, supported the observation that a significant decrease in
serum HER-2/neu from pretreatment level was a predictor of outcome after trastuzumab-based therapies.
Because all of those earlier reports used small patient
cohorts and reported different serum HER-2/neu cutoff levels, we coordinated a multicenter/multinational study of 307 patients with MBC that analyzed
serum HER-2/neu levels at baseline and compared
those levels with serum HER-2/neu levels from blood
drawn a median of 30 days after the initiation of
trastuzumab-based therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients who were eligible for participation in the
current study were women with MBC who received
trastuzumab therapy with or without chemotherapy
according to the established practice of the treating
physician. Patients were trastuzumab-naive at the
time of entry into this study. The first (baseline) serum sample for each patient was taken before trastuzumab therapy was started. The second serum
sample was obtained from patients 16 to 120 days after trastuzumab therapy was started. Data from all
solicited investigators were included to avoid bias.
One center collected the second serum sample 120
days after treatment was started; however, only 67
patients (22%) had the second serum sample drawn
60 days after treatment was started. Individual
patient data were obtained from participating institutions, and an analysis of the pooled individual data
was performed. Each participating institution
received approval from their internal Institutional
Review Board to contribute patients to this study.
Evaluation of Tumor Response and Clinical Endpoints
Response to treatment was assessed according to the
criteria of the World Health Organization24 or
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.25 The
objective response rate (ORR) was defined by including patients who achieved a complete response and
patients who achieved a partial response. The time
to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from
the start of trastuzumab therapy to the time of tumor

progression. The duration of response (DRP) was
also defined as the time from the start of trastuzumab therapy to tumor progression in the subgroup
of patients who had a complete or partial response
to therapy. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from
the start of trastuzumab therapy until death.

Serum HER-2/neu Assay
Serum HER-2/neu testing was performed by using either the Siemens Immuno-1 automated assay or the
manual microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. The FDA has cleared both methods with an indication for follow-up and monitoring of patients with
MBC. Previous studies have demonstrated similar
diagnostic performance of the automated and manual
methods, with very high correlation between the
methods (r2 5 0.99), because the antibodies used for
capture and detection of the circulating HER-2/neu
antigen are identical for both assays. The study published by Payne et al demonstrated that trastuzumab
does not interfere with the serum HER-2/neu assay.26
Statistical Analysis
Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal serum HER-2/neu
cutoff level. From that ROC analysis, a significant serum HER-2/neu decline was defined as a decrease
>20% at the follow-up visit. This definition of a significant change was similar to that derived from the FDAcleared cutoff value for nontrastuzumab therapies.
Further data analysis was performed by comparing the group of patients who achieved this signifi-

cant decline in serum HER-2/neu level (>20%) with
patients who did not achieve this decline in serum
HER-2/neu. The chi-square and logistic regression
statistical tests were used to analyze categorical data.
The log-rank test and a Cox proportional-hazards
multivariate model were used to analyze the time to
event variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis and graphs
were generated using SPSS (Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences) for Windows (version 11.0).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
This was a retrospective analysis of pooled data from
7 institutions comprising 307 patients with MBC who
received trastuzumab-based therapy. Table 1 provides
the demographics of the patient population. All demographic variables were balanced, except that fewer
patients who achieved a significant decline in serum
HER-2/neu levels (>20%) had received trastuzumab
monotherapy; those patients also had higher baseline
serum HER-2 levels (median, 52.9 ng/mL; range, 7.46076 ng/mL) compared with patients who did not
have a decline in serum HER-2/neu levels (median,
15.9 ng/mL; range, 5.2-4180 ng/mL). Table 2 shows
the HER-2/neu status of the primary breast tumor
and indicates that 76.5% of patients had 31 IHC
HER-2/neu overexpression or had HER-2/neu gene
amplification documented by FISH analysis. Table 2
also shows that 10% of patients had 21 IHC overexpression, 2% had 11 IHC overexpression, 4.5% had
negative IHC results for antibody staining, and 6%
had unknown HER-2/neu status. Statistical analyses
were conducted on the entire patient population,
and on the patient subset with 31 IHC overexpression and/or FISH-amplified HER-2/neu, and on the
patient subset baseline serum HER-2/neu levels >15
ng/mL or <15 ng/mL (15 ng/mL is the upper limit
of normal for serum HER-2).9

FIGURE 2. This chart illustrates the duration of response (n 5 142) in
patients who achieved a complete or partial response grouped by patients
who achieved a significant decline (>20% decrease) in serum levels of
HER-2/neu from baseline and those who did not (<20% decrease).

A follow-up serum sample was collected at a median of 30 days after the start of trastuzumab therapy
(range, 16-120 days). One center collected the followup sample at 120 days after the start of trastuzumab
therapy. Fifty-eight percent of the patients who
achieved a significant decline in serum HER-2/neu
levels (<20%) had follow-up samples collected by
Day 30 compared with 53% of patients who did not
have a significant decline in serum HER-2/neu levels.
There was no significant difference in the time from
pretreatment to posttreatment blood draw between
these 2 groups.

Change in Serum HER-2/neu Levels
ROC analysis was performed to determine the cutoff
that yielded the optimal patient response to trastuzumab treatment (Fig. 1). From that ROC analysis, the
optimal serum HER-2/neu decline was defined as a
decrease >20% at the follow-up blood draw (ROC
sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 50%). This definition of a
significant change was similar to that derived from
the FDA-cleared cutoff for nontrastuzumab therapies.
According to this ROC-selected, optimized serum
HER-2/neu change cutoff, 191 of 307 patients (62%)
achieved a significant decline in serum HER-2/neu
(levels decreased >20%), whereas 116 of 307 patients
(37.8%) did not achieve a significant decline in serum HER-2/neu (levels decreased <20%).
Overall Response Rate and Duration of Response
The ORR (complete plus partial responses) to trastuzumab-based therapy in patients who achieved a sig-

nificant decline in serum HER-2/neu levels (>20%)
was more than double (57%) compared with the
ORR for patients who did not achieve this decline in
serum HER-2/neu (28%; P < .001). In the subgroup
of 142 patients who had an objective response, the
median DRP was significantly longer for patients
who achieved a significant decline (>20%) in serum
HER-2/neu compared with patients who did not
(369 days vs 230 days; P 5 .008) (Fig. 2).

Time to Progression
Figure 3 compares the TTP in patients who had
declines <20% or >20% in serum HER-2/neu levels
from baseline and indicates that patients who
achieved a significant decline (>20%) had a longer
TTP (320 days) compared with patients who did not
achieve a significant decline (180 days; P < .0001). A
multivariate model was performed adjusting for
baseline variables, and a significant decline (>20%)
in serum HER-2/neu was an independent predictive
factor for longer TTP (Table 3).
Overall Survival
Figure 4 compares the survival of patients who had
declines <20% and >20% in serum HER-2/neu levels
from baseline. Survival data were available for 241 of
307 patients: One hundred forty-three of 241 patients
(59%) died, and the median follow-up for survivors
was 860 days. OS was significantly longer for patients
who achieved a significant decline (>20%) in serum
HER-2/neu (898 days vs 593 days; P 5 .018) (Fig. 4).

identify a patient group more likely to be resistant to
trastuzumab. Our results confirm several smaller
publications in patients with MBC who received trastuzumab-based therapy.19-23 Kostler et al19 used multiple logistic regression analyses and identified the
kinetics of serum HER-2/neu levels as the only factor
that allowed for the accurate prediction of response
to trastuzumab-based therapy. They reported that serial changes in serum HER-2/neu levels not only paralleled the clinical course of disease but also
preceded clinical changes, and this allowed for a significant prediction of response, clinical benefit, and
progression-free survival in the early weeks of trastuzumab-based treatment.19 In a report by Esteva et al,
patients with MBC were monitored for serum HER2/neu levels over 12 to 20 months, and the results
indicated that progression-free survival differed significantly according to the serum HER-2/neu decline
within the first 2 to 4 weeks of initiating therapy.20
Fornier et al evaluated HER-2/neu levels from
patients with MBC at baseline and after 12 weeks of
therapy with paclitaxel and trastuzumab, and they
reported that patients with elevated serum HER-2/
neu levels that normalized after 12 weeks of therapy
had a higher response rate compared with patients
who had persistently high serum levels of HER-2/
neu.21 Another report by Bethune-Volters et al concluded that serum HER-2/neu monitoring during
trastuzumab therapy was an early indicator of
patient outcome and was a powerful predictor of survival.22 In a report by Tse et al, serum HER-2/neu
levels before and after therapy were predictors of
clinical outcome; patients who had the least decline
in serum HER-2/neu levels had a shorter TTP.23
In this multicenter, retrospective analysis of
pooled data from 307 patients with MBC who

1299

received trastuzumab-based therapies, we performed
ROC analysis and identified the optimal cutoff point
for serum change in HER-2/neu that yielded the
maximal specificity and sensitivity for patient
response to trastuzumab therapy. This analysis
defined a significant decline >20% in serum HER-2/
neu as the optimal cutoff point for patient response
to trastuzumab therapy. Overall, 191 of 307 patients
(62%) achieved this significant decline in HER-2/neu
levels (20%) at first follow-up, and 116 of 307
patients (38%) did not achieve this decline (<20%
decrease). The ORR (complete responses 1 partial
responses) was doubled (57%) for patients who
achieved a significant decline (>20%) in serum HER2/neu levels compared with a 28% response rate for
patients who did not. Patients who achieved this significant decline in serum HER-2/neu levels also had
a significantly longer time to disease progression
(320 days vs 182 days; P <.001), longer DRP (369 days
vs 230 days; P 5 .003), and longer OS (898 days vs
593 days; P <.012). The results were similar for the subgroup of patients who had baseline levels above or
below the 15 mg/mL cutoff, and for the subgroup of
patients who had either 31 IHC overexpression or
FISH amplification.
The current results in the largest patient group
studied to date establish a serum HER-2/neu decline
20% as the optimal cutpoint for predicting the
greatest response to trastuzumab and, conversely,
indicate that the remaining patient cohort (40%) has
relative resistance to trastuzumab therapy. According
to the current 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists guidelines
for HER-2 IHC/FISH testing,27 50% of HER-2/neupositive patients selected will still be resistant to trastuzumab-based therapy. Proposed mechanisms of
trastuzumab resistance, including loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), mutation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (P13K), activation of insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor signaling, activation of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and mucin
4 masking of HER-2, are currently being studied.28,29
Another mechanism of trastuzumab resistance may
be full-length p185 HER-2/neu cleavage by the
ADAM proteases into a cell membrane-bound portion, which contains a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase domain (p95), and the corresponding
ECD measured in serum.30 HER-2 p95-expressing
tumors occurred with increased frequency in lymph
node-positive breast cancer (23 of 78 tumors) compared with lymph node-negative breast cancers (9 of
63 tumors; P 5 .032).30 Thus, HER-2 p95 generation
may endow the tumor cell with increased metastatic
potential, and serum HER-2/neu may function as a

1300

surrogate biomarker of HER-2 p95 generation. The
HER-2/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib,
which recently was approved for use in patients with
trastuzumab-resistant MBC,31 has been proposed as
an alternative treatment for patients who have
tumors that express HER-2 p95, because only 1 of 11
HER-2 p95-positive patients responded to trastuzumab.32 Recently, it was demonstrated that novel
agents, such as an ADAM sheddase inhibitor,
enhanced the antitumor effect of trastuzumab in
HER-2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells.33
Also, a novel heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp-90) inhibitor, tanespimycin (17-AAG; KOS-953), in combination
with trastuzumab, was tolerated well and had antitumor activity in patients who had HER-2 1 breast
cancer with tumors that progressed during treatment
with trastuzumab.34
In the current report, patients who did not have
a significant decline (20%) in serum HER-2/neu
levels had decreased benefit from trastuzumab-based
therapy. Monitoring changes in serum HER-2 levels
at a median of 1 month after trastuzumab treatment
to predict clinical response may be valuable for identifying a patient population that might benefit from
additional treatment regimens with other HER-2/
neu-targeted therapies. Currently, although trastuzumab should not be stopped based on the absence of
a decline in serum HER-2 levels, prospective clinical
trials evaluating the use of other HER-2-directed
therapies (ie, lapatinib, Hsp-90 inhibitor, sheddase
inhibitor) with and without continued trastuzumab
therapy are warranted for patients who do not
achieve a 20% decline in serum HER-2.
