ABSTRACT
In our previous studies, we reported that CD133+ cancer stem cells (CSCs) were
chemoresistant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that isocorydine treatment
decreased the percentage of CD133+ CSCs. Here, we found that a derivative of
isocorydine (d-ICD) inhibited HCC cell growth, particularly among the CD133+
subpopulation, and rendered HCC cells more sensitive to sorafenib treatment.
d-ICD inhibited IGF2BP3 expression in a time-dependent manner, and IGF2BP3
expression negatively correlated with d-ICD-induced growth suppression. IGF2BP3
overexpression enriched the CD133+ CSC subpopulation in HCC, enhanced tumor
sphere formation and suppressed the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib and doxorubicin.
The expression of drug resistance-related genes, including ABCB1 and ABCG2, and
the CSC marker CD133 expression was increased after IGF2BP3 overexpression. The
significance of these observations was underscored by our findings that high IGF2BP3
expression predicted poor survival in a cohort of 236 patients with HCC and positively
correlated with ABCG2 and CD133 expression in vivo. These results suggested that
the d-ICD may inhibit HCC cells growth by IGF2BP3 decrease and that IGF2BP3 may
serve as a therapeutic target for HCC.

of the obstacles to the effective treatment of HCC is its
resistance to a wide spectrum of chemotherapies.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to drug
resistance during the treatment of HCC [2]. CD133 is a
HCC CSC marker. A small population of CD133+ cells
in HCC cell lines and in primary HCC tissues mediates
the high tumorigenicity and clonogenicity of HCC and
upregulates the expression of multiple drug resistancerelated genes [3]. Cells that are double-positive for CD133
and CD44 are more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common forms of cancer worldwide, and the prognosis
of HCC patients is startling low unless the disease is
diagnosed early [1]. However, in spite of its growing
prevalence, efficient therapies are dismayingly limited.
Beyond physical approaches such as radiation and surgery,
few therapies are recognized, and a short list of expensive
candidate drugs that display a high failure rate exists. One

due to the upregulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
superfamily transporters, including ABCB1 and ABCG2
[4]. Additionally, a positive correlation between ABCG2
expression and the drug resistance of HCC cell lines
has been confirmed. ABCG2 is preferentially expressed
in highly chemoresistant HCC cancer stem cells with
enriched CD133 expression [5]. Thus, targeting CD133+
CSCs displaying high tumorigenicity and chemoresistance
is definitely necessary for the development of efficient
anti-cancer strategies for HCC.
Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein
3 (IGF2BP3, IMP-3) is considered an oncofetal protein
because of its time-dependent expression in human
fetal tissues but not in adult tissues [6]. The expression
of IGF2BP3 is strongly associated with advanced
tumor stage and is a predictor of poor prognosis among
patients with HCC as well as IGF2BP1 [7, 8]. Silencing
IGF2BP3, a TLR4/NANOG–dependent gene, inhibits
pluripotency genes and tumorigenesis and abrogates the
chemoresistance of tumor-initiating cells [9]. In addition,
its expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells, which
are resistant to many chemotherapeutics, increased their
sensitivity to doxorubicin and mitoxantrone significantly
by directly binding to ABCG2 mRNA and regulating
ABCG2 expression [10]. Our previous study showed that
isocorydine (ICD) treatment significantly decreased the
percentage of CD133+ cells in HCC [11]. However, the
effective concentration of ICD was too high to be tested in
a clinical trial [12, 13]. To improve the anticancer activity
of ICD, ten ICD derivatives were tested. Among these
derivatives, 8-amino-ICD (d-ICD) exerted an inhibitory
effect on murine hepatoma H22-induced tumors and
was selected for further analysis [14]. Our research
here showed that d-ICD treatment inhibited HCC cell
growth and sensitized cancer cells to sorafenib. Further
investigation indicated that d-ICD diminished the CD133+
CSC subpopulation in HCC and downregulated ABCB1,
ABCG2 and CD133 expression via IGF2BP3 suppression.

MHCC-97L cell growth was suppressed by d-ICD
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Because sorafenib is currently a commonly used
anti-HCC drug in clinics, we analyzed the effect of a low
d-ICD dose, which inhibition ratio was approximately
10% in the corresponding cell line, combined with
different doses of sorafenib in HCC cells to determine
whether these compounds act synergistically. MTT
assays performed 24 h after drug treatment showed
that the MHCC-97L, PLC/PRF/5 and Huh7 cells were
more sensitive to this drug combination compared with
sorafenib treatment alone, indicating that this low dose of
d-ICD enhances the cytotoxic effect of sorafenib on HCC
cells in vitro (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S1).
We also examined the sensitivity of the CD133+
subpopulation to d-ICD. A magnetic-activated cell
sorting experiment was performed to separate the
CD133+ and CD133− subpopulations in PLC/PRF/5,
MHCC-97L and Huh7 cells. After the cells were treated
for 24 h, d-ICD exerted stronger cell growth inhibition
on both the PLC/PRF/5, MHCC-97L and Huh7 CD133+
cell populations than the corresponding CD133− cell
populations (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure S1).
CD133 expression in different subpopulations was
confirmed by western blot analysis to establish the
separation efficiency. These results demonstrated that
d-ICD exerts an effect similar to that of ICD on cell
growth inhibition and CD133+ subpopulation depletion
in HCC cell lines. Moreover, we found that d-ICD
sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib treatment.

IGF2BP3 downregulation contributed to the
suppression of d-ICD-induced drug resistance
To further evaluate the molecular mechanism by
which d-ICD inhibited cell growth in HCC, we applied
cDNA microarrays to detect the differentially expressed
genes in Huh7 and SMMC-7721 cells between the
control and d-ICD treatment groups. The resulting genes
were verified via RT-PCR assays, and we confirmed
the deregulation of several genes in Huh7 cells due to
d-ICD treatment (Supplementary Table S1). Among these
candidate genes, we found that the drug resistance-related
genes ABCB1 and ABCG2, as well as the stemnessrelated genes CD133, Lgr5, IGF2BP3 and IGF2BP1,
were downregulated at the mRNA level, and CD133,
IGF2BP3, ABCB1 and ABCG2 protein expression were
also downregulated following d-ICD treatment (Figure 2A
and 2B). Among these genes, IGF2BP3 mRNA expression
gradually decreased after exposure to d-ICD in Huh7,
MHCC-97L and PLC/PRF/5 cells in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure S1).
To study the role of IGF2BP3 in d-ICD treatment, we
first analyzed intrinsic IGF2BP3 expression in several HCC
cell lines to select appropriated cell lines for the following
analysis, and CD133 expression in different cell lines was

RESULTS
d-ICD inhibited the growth of HCC cells,
particularly in the CD133+ subpopulation
To investigate the effect of d-ICD on HCC cell
growth, the HCC cell lines MHCC-97L, MHCC-97H,
Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 were incubated with various
concentrations of d-ICD for 24 to 48 h. Then, cell growth
was measured by the MTT assay. Our results indicated
that d-ICD inhibited HCC cell growth in a dose- and timedependent manner similar to ICD (Figure 1A). Notably,
the effective dose of d-ICD dramatically decreased in
these HCC cell lines compared with the effective dose of
ICD, which is approximately 200 μg/ml in HCC cells [11],
almost ten times the effective dose of d-ICD. Moreover,
the colony formation assay confirmed that Huh7 and

also taken in consideration [4] (Supplementary Figure S2).
Then, IGF2BP3 was ectopically overexpressed in PLC/
PRF/5, Huh7 and MHCC-97L cells and confirmed by
western blot analysis (Figure 2D). The MTT assay results
revealed that the MHCC-97L-IGF2BP3-EX-NEG (MHCC97L-IGF2BP3) and PLC/PRF/5-IGF2BP3-EX-NEG (PLC/
PRF/5-IGF2BP3) cells were less sensitive to various doses
of d-ICD than those of the control cells infected with the
EX-NEG vector lentivirus (Figure 2D). Conversely, as
shown in Figure 2E, transfection with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) oligonucleotides specifically targeting IGF2BP3
clearly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of d-ICD on Huh7
and MHCC-97L cells. The knockdown efficiency was
confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S2).
IGF2BP3 protein could bind to IGF2 mRNA and promote

IGF2 protein expression in human rhabdomyosarcoma
cells [15]. We also analyzed IGF2 expression after
IGF2BP3 was knocked down or overexpressed. Real-time
PCR assay displayed that IGF2 mRNA expression was
positively correlated with IGF2BP3 expression in HCC
(Supplementary Figure S2). These results indicated that
IGF2BP3 may be a target gene of d-ICD in HCC cells that
plays a crucial role in d-ICD-induced growth inhibition.

IGF2BP3 enriched the CD133+ CSC population
and promoted HCC cell chemoresistance
In our previous studies, we demonstrated that
CD133 is a marker of HCC CSCs. As shown in Figure 3A,

2.139% to 27.3% ± 2.145% following treatment with 15

PLC/PRF/5 cells after these cells were exposed to 20 μg/

the CD133+ cell population in both cell lines, and the

Next, self-renew is an important feature of CSCs.

d-ICD-treated Huh7 cells continually cultured in stem
cell conditioned chemically defined medium (CDM)
were fewer in number and smaller in size than those
from the control cells. After IGF2BP3 overexpression,
the tumor sphere formation ability of these cells was
significantly enhanced, and d-ICD treatment did not
completely abolish this effect, indicating that IGF2BP3
overexpression enhances the self-renewal capability of
HCC cells and partially reverses the inhibitory effects of
d-ICD. We observed similar results using the PLC/PRF/5
cell line (Figure 3B).
To analyze the chemotherapy drug sensitivity of
IGF2BP3-overexpressing HCC cells, we designed MTT
assays to test the efficacy of sorafenib and doxorubicin.
Compared to the control conditions, the overexpression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of IGF2BP3 rendered Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells less
sensitive to these two commonly used drugs. These results
suggested that IGF2BP3 positively regulates HCC cell
stemness and promotes HCC cell chemoresistance.

IGF2BP3 upregulated the expression of ABC
family genes and enhanced doxorubicin effluxion
The downregulation of IGF2BP3 led to the
suppression of ABCB1, ABCG2 and CD133 mRNA
expression in MHCC-97L and Huh7 cells (Figure
4A). IGF2BP3 overexpression deregulated ABCB1,
ABCG2 and CD133 mRNA expression in Huh7,
MHCC-97L and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Figure 4B), and we
observed a moderate upregulation of the expression of

The IGF2BP3 expression level correlated with
adverse clinicopathological characteristics
in HCC patients

the stemness-related genes Nanog and Oct-4 in HCC
cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Western blot analysis
indicated a similar expression pattern at the protein
level (Figure 4C and 4D). Similar to the results shown
in Figure 2B, western blot analysis indicated that d-ICD
treatment decreased ABCB1, ABCG2 and CD133
protein expression but that IGF2BP3 upregulation nearly
completely abolished this effect of d-ICD on HCC cells
(Figure 4D). These results demonstrated that ABCB1,
ABCG2 and CD133 may be downstream target genes of
IGF2BP3 in HCC.
The anticancer drug doxorubicin is commonly
used in HCC chemotherapy and is a naturally fluorescent
molecule that can be transported by ABCB1 and ABCG2.
Our previous study demonstrated that the intracellular
concentration of doxorubicin can be monitored via
flow cytometry [16]. As shown in Figure 4E, IGF2BP3
overexpression enhanced the effluxion of doxorubicin
in MHCC-97L and PLC/PRF/5 cells. d-ICD treatment
promoted the retention of doxorubicin, and IGF2BP3
overexpression partially reversed this effect of d-ICD.
These results clearly indicated that the active drug efflux
ability of the endogenous ABCB1 and ABCG2 proteins
correlated with IGF2BP3 expression in HCC and was
suppressed by d-ICD treatment.

In 30 paired tumor and adjacent noncancerous liver
tissues from HCC patients, we analyzed the expression
levels of IGF2BP3 via real-time RT-PCR and western
blot. We found that the majority of tumor tissue samples
expressed a higher level of IGF2BP3 than the corresponding
adjacent non-cancerous tissue samples at both the mRNA
(Figure 5A) and protein levels (Figure 5B) (Supplementary
Figure S3), suggesting that a high level of IGF2BP3
expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients.
Then, immunohistochemical (IHC) assays indicated
that the frequency of positive staining for IGF2BP3 was
40.67% (96/236) in a cohort of 236 patients with HCC.
Further analysis showed that the IGF2BP3 levels were
significantly higher in the HCC patients with higher
histological grades or with intrahepatic metastasis (p < 0.05)
(Table 1). Furthermore, we analyzed CD133, ABCG2 and
ABCB1 expression via IHC (Figure 5C). The frequencies of
positive staining for CD133, ABCG2 and ABCB1 proteins
were 70.33% (166/236), 50% (118/236), and 63.14%
(169/236), respectively, and IGF2BP3 expression positively
correlated with both CD133 and ABCG2 expression

Here, we showed that d-ICD exerted a relatively
stronger inhibitory effect on the CD133+ cell population
than the corresponding CD133− cell population at a much
lower effective dose than its parent compound ICD.
Furthermore, d-ICD treatment remarkably inhibited the
tumorigenicity of Huh7 cells, which contain a relatively
high percentage of CD133+ cells (data to be published
elsewhere). Based on cDNA microarray analysis, we
discovered a key d-ICD target, IGF2BP3. A previous study
showed that IGF2BP3 expression significantly correlated
with CD44s expression, and the expression levels of both
IGF2BP3 and CD44s correlated with advanced tumor

(p < 0.05), which suggested that IGF2BP3 regulates CD133
and ABCG2 expression in vivo (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Among the five primary components of Dicrano­
stigma leptopodum (Maxim) Fedde (DLF) extracts, we
found that ICD inhibits the proliferation of HCC cells
[17]. The mechanism underlying the anti-tumor properties
of ICD included its induction of a significant decrease in
the CD133+ cell subpopulation, an effect that traditional
chemotherapy drugs were unable to accomplish [11].

stage and grade in HCC [18]. Several studies addressing
IGF2BP3 expression in colorectal cancer have detected
significantly elevated IGF2BP3 expression in the majority
of aggressive colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), suggesting
that IGF2BP3 expression correlates with an unfavorable
prognosis. Similarly, the present study revealed that
high levels of IGF2BP3 expression correlated with both
Edmondson’s grade and intrahepatic metastasis in HCC,
corresponding to an adverse prognosis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that CSCs have a
particularly regenerative capacity; thus, this property must
be inhibited to achieve the stable remission or even a cure
for cancer [19]. Self-renewal may be the most important
and useful property of CSCs. Our results showed that
d-ICD treatment effectively inhibits CD133 expression via
IGF2BP3 downregulation. Furthermore, d-ICD treatment
may decrease the percentage of CD133+ CSC cells and
suppress their self-renew capability, which is believed to
contribute to drug resistance. CSCs from various tumor types
characteristically express drug resistance-related proteins,
particularly ABC family proteins [20, 21]. ABCG2 is closely
associated with chemotherapy drug resistance and is highly
expressed in enriched CD90+/CD133+ liver CSCs. Our
previous studies showed that high ABCG2 expression in liver
CSCs may be the cause of high drug resistance in liver cancer
[4, 5]. The development of multidrug resistance (MDR)
in cancers is also associated with the overexpression of
ABCB1 [22]. ABCB1, which exports many conventional
chemicals, particularly doxorubicin, out of cells and
renders chemotherapy inefficient [23], may also display a
close relationship with the resistance to clinically relevant
chemotherapies. ABCB1 overexpression occurs in various
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

types of tumors [24], and high ABCB1 expression is
associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia [24, 25]. We found that IGF2BP3
overexpression led to ABCB1 and ABCG2 upregulation,
which may result in resistance to many conventional
chemicals. Additionally, IGF2BP3 overexpression led to
the enrichment of the CD133+ subpopulation, which may
contribute to ABCG2 and ABCB1 upregulation. We had also
found a positive correlation between IGF2BP3, ABCG2 and
CD133 expression in vivo. However there was no significant
correlation between IGF2BP3 and ABCB1 expression
observed, indicating that the regulation effect of IGF2BP3
on ABCB1 expression in HCC cells may be complementary
in vivo. Therefore, targeting IGF2BP3 in HCC cells, but not
in normal cells, which can express barely detectable levels of
IGFP2BP3, may be a more effective treatment.
IGF2BP3 was previously reported to be preferentially
expressed in triple-negative breast cancers, which exhibit
multi-drug resistance and increased aggressiveness.
IGF2BP3 binds to BCRP mRNA and regulates BCRP
expression; this finding provides insight into the mechanism
by which IGF2BP3 contributes to the aggressiveness of
cancers [25]. Functional studies addressing the regulatory
role of IGF2BP3 revealed two validated target mRNAs and
several putative candidates, including IGF2 and ABCG2.
Two laboratories reported that IGF2BP3 regulates the
translation of IGF2 mRNA [26, 27]. However, in this study,
we had not verified the detailed mechanism underlying
IGF2BP3 function in HCC. Whether IGF2BP3 also directly
binds to ABCG2, CD133 or ABCB1 mRNA to regulate
their expression at the post-transcription level remains to
be investigated in our future studies. Another possible way
25157

that IGF2BP3 regulate these genes expression may rely on
its regulation of IGF2 [15]. We analysis the expression of
IGF2 mRNA after IGF2BP3 overexpression or knocked
down. The results showed that IGF2BP3 could also regulate
IGF2 expression in HCC cells. Bendall et al reported that
blocking IGF2 reduced survival and clonogenicity of human
embryonic stem (ES) cells and IGF2 alone was sufficient
in maintaining human ES cell cultures [28]. IGF2BP3 may
increase the cancer stem cell percentage through IGF2 in
HCC, which probably lead to the stemness-related genes
like CD133 and ABCB1 expression up-regulation.
Taken together, IGF2BP3 is involved in the selective
effects of d-ICD on CD133+ HCC CSCs and represents
a potential target for future HCC therapy. Our findings
suggest that a combination of sorafenib and d-ICD may
be a promising approach to overcoming the therapeutic
resistance of human HCC.

concentrations for 24 h or 48 h. The MTT stock solution,
which was diluted to 0.5 μg/ml, was added to each well
and incubated for 4 h. Finally, the crystals were dissolved
in DMSO, and absorbance was measured using an ELISA
plate reader. The growth inhibition rate was calculated as
follows: Growth inhibition rate = 1 – (A570 – A630) of
the experimental cells/(A570 – A630) of the control cells.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Then, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The proteins
on the membranes were incubated with specific primary
antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Supplementary Table S2), followed by chemiluminescence
detection using a Super Signal West Femto Chemiluminescent
Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientific, Cat No. 34095).

Cell lines and cell culture
The human HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and
Huh7 were provided by the Cell Bank of the Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Shanghai, China). MHCC97L, MHCC-97H and MHCC-LM3 cells were obtained
from the Liver Cancer Institute of Zhongshan Hospital
at Fudan University (Shanghai, China). PLC/PRF/5 cells
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (Manassas, USA). All cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(HyClone, Logan, UT) that was heat-inactivated at 56°C
for 30 min and then supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin
G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). All cell lines were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

RNA interference-mediated gene silencing
siRNA oligos for IGF2BP3 and a generic negative
control sequence were synthesized by GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). The sequences were as follows: IGF2BP3homo-979 sense: 5′-GCUGCUGAGAAGUCGAUUATT-3′;
antisense: 5′-UAAUCGACUUCUCAGCAGCT T-3′; IGF
2BP3-homo-1028 sense: 5′-CGGCUUGUAAGUCUAUU
CUTT-3′; antisense: 5′-AGAAUA GACUUACAAGCCG
TT-3′; and IGF2BP3-homo-1567 sense: 5′-GCUGGAGCUU
CAAUUAAGATT-3′; antisense: 5′-UCUUAAUUGAAGCU
CCAGCTT-3′.

Drug stocks
Isocorydine derivates (d-ICD), prepared through
chemical structure modifications of isocorydine (ICD), which
was synthesized from ICD using a previously described
method [29] was dissovled in PBS and diluted to 100 mg/
ml in PBS and stored at 4°C in a dark container. Sorafenib
tosylate (CAS No. 475207-59-1), a multikinase inhibitor, was
diluted to 100 nmol/μl in DMSO and stored at 4°C.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and then reversetranscribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript™ RT Reagent
Kit (TaKaRa). The primers used for quantitative RT-PCR
are provided in Supplementary Table S3.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or
magnetic-activated cell sorting

Plasmid constructs, lentivirus production, and
cell transfection

The PLC/PFR/5 and Huh7 cells were incubated
with PE-conjugated CD133/1 (AC133) antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany), and the percentage of CD133+ cells was
detected using an Epics Altra flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, USA). For MHCC-97L and PLC/PFR/5 cells,
the CD133+ and CD133– cells were magnetically isolated

HCC cells were plated in generic 6-well plates (NUNC)
as a monolayer culture in serum-free CDM. For d-ICD
treatment, different amounts of d-ICD were added to the CDM
to reach a final concentration of 15 μg/ml for Huh7 cells or
20 μg/ml for PLC/PRF/5 cells. The CDM consisted of a 1:1
mixture of neurobasal medium and DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with 0.5 × N2, 0.5 × B27 supplement, 0.1%
bovine serum albumin, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 0.1 mmol/L
2-mercaptoethanol; growth factors including 10 ng/ml basic
fibroblast growth factor (Millipore), 10 ng/ml EGF (Millipore),
20 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor (Millipore), 20 ng/ml
TGFα (Millipore), and 10 × 7 mol/L dexamethasone (Sigma
Aldrich) were added. The reagents that were not otherwise
indicated were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (US).
