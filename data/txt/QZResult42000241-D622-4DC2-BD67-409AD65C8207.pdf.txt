The forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 has a key role in DNA damage response, and its deregulated overexpression is associated
with genotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer. However, little is known about the posttranslational mechanisms by which FOXM1
expression is regulated by genotoxic agents and how they are deregulated in resistant cells. Initial co-immunoprecipitation studies
veriﬁed previous proteomic analysis ﬁnding that the OTUB1 is a novel FOXM1-interacting protein. Western blot analysis showed
that both OTUB1 and FOXM1 expression reduced upon genotoxic agent treatment in MCF-7 cells, but remained relatively constant
in resistant cells. FOXM1 expression reduced upon OTUB1 depletion by siRNA and increased with OTUB1 overexpression in
MCF-7 cells, arguing that OTUB1 positively regulates FOXM1 expression. In agreement, co-immunoprecipitation experiments
demonstrated that FOXM1 expression is associated with OTUB1 binding but inversely correlates with conjugation to the protein
degradation-associated Lys-48-linked ubiquitin-chains. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S) mutant,
disrupted the formation of Lys48-linked ubiquitin-conjugates on FOXM1. Importantly, knockdown of OTUB1 by siRNA resulted in an
increase in turnover of FOXM1 in MCF-7 cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, whereas overexpression of
WT OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S) mutant, signiﬁcantly enhances the half-life of FOXM1. In addition, proliferative and clonogenic
assays also show that OTUB1 can enhance the proliferative rate and epirubicin resistance through targeting FOXM1, as OTUB1 has
little effect on FOXM1-deﬁcient cells. The physiological relevance of the regulation of FOXM1 by OTUB1 is further underscored by
the signiﬁcant correlations between FOXM1 and OTUB1 expression in breast cancer patient samples. Cox-regression survival
analysis indicates that OTUB1 overexpression is linked to poorer outcome in particular in patients treated with chemotherapy.
Collectively, these data suggest that OTUB1 limits the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1 in breast cancer and has a key role
in genotoxic agent resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent causes of death in
women worldwide. Genotoxic anti-cancer agents, including
anthracyclines, platinum compounds, methylating agents and
ionizing irradiation, are used widely to treat breast cancer patients
who are not suitable for hormonal therapy and those with
advanced or metastatic cancer. These genotoxic agents are also
often used in the adjuvant setting, particularly after surgery, to
prevent the return of the disease. However, resistance to these
agents often emerges in patients, and this leads to suboptimal
efﬁcacy and disease relapse.1 The cellular response to DNA
damage is a key determinant of the efﬁcacy of these genotoxic
agents, and these reactions include initiation of DNA damage
repair response, cell cycle-checkpoint activation and induction of
apoptosis or senescence. These processes ultimately govern cell
fate and sensitivity to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Conversely,
a deregulated DNA damage response can lead to resistance to
these anticancer agents.
Substantial evidence has accumulated to indicate that the
Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor has a central role in

cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, stem cell
renewal, DNA damage repair and cellular senescence, which
impact tumour initiation, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis
and drug sensitivity. Recent research also indicates that deregulated FOXM1 overexpression confers genotoxic and other
chemotherapeutic agent resistance in cancer.2–7 There is
already good evidence that FOXM1 acts as a mediator of DNA
damage response as well as a modulator of genotoxic agent
sensitivity.4–6,8–10 Even though deregulated FOXM1 overexpression is considered key to the development of genotoxic agent
resistance, the speciﬁc mechanisms involved in FOXM1 deregulation remain unknown. Therefore, a better understanding of the
mechanisms that regulates FOXM1 expression in response to
genotoxic agents and how FOXM1 is deregulated in resistant
cancer cells is of importance for designing new therapeutic
approaches directed to this degradation pathway.
Epirubicin is an anthracycline genotoxic drug commonly used
for treating breast cancer.11 FOXM1 is downregulated by
epirubicin at the transcriptional levels in breast cancer
cells.8,12,13 However, the fact that FOXM1 protein expression

declines at a faster kinetics when compared with its mRNA
transcripts in response to genotoxic agents indicates that
posttranscriptional mechanisms have a central role in regulating
its DNA-damaging agent response in breast cancer cells.8,12 In
agreement, we have also shown recently that upon epirubicin
treatment, FOXM1 is modiﬁed through SUMOylation, which leads
to its ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitinproteasome proteolytic pathway.10
Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modiﬁcation that confers a
range of protein regulatory functions, including targeting a
substrate protein for degradation, modifying its activity, adjusting
its function, changing its subcellular location and altering protein–
protein interactions. Ubiquitination is a dynamic process and can
be reversed by deubiquitination, which is catalysed by a family
of proteins that are ubiquitin hydrolases or deubiquitinating
enzymes called DUBs. OTUB1 (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin
aldehyde-binding proteins 1; also called Otubain 1) belongs to the
ovarian tumour domain protease (OTU) subfamily of DUBs. OTUB1
can negatively regulate ubiquitination and control protein stability
and activity via a non-canonical mechanism as well as the
conventional catalytic process. More speciﬁcally, OTUB1 can
function as a cysteine protease that hydrolyses the isopeptide
bond between ubiquitin and the target protein or another
ubiquitin molecule. Alternatively, OTUB1 can also operate through
a non-canonical mechanism independently of its catalytic activity,
by inhibiting the activity of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes.
To explore the mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression is
modulated at the posttranslational level as well as the molecules
involved, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of protein
complexes co-immunoprecipitated with FOXM1 in the breast
carcinoma MCF-7 cell line and identiﬁed the deubiquitinase
OTUB1 as a novel FOXM1-interacting factor. Given our previous
ﬁnding that genotoxic agents cause FOXM1 SUMOylation,
ubiquitination and degradation, these observations led us to
hypothesize that OTUB1 promotes FOXM1 expression at the
posttranslational level to potentiate genotoxic agent resistance. In
this study, we examined the potential role of OTUB1 in the
regulation of FOXM1 expression in genotoxic drug-sensitive and
-resistant breast cancer cells.
RESULTS
OTUB1 interacts with FOXM1 in breast cancer cells
To conﬁrm the mass spectrometry-based proteomic ﬁnding, we
ﬁrst examined whether endogenous OTUB1 binds to FOXM1 in
the drug-sensitive MCF-7 and the drug-resistant MCF-7EpiR cells
by co-immunoprecipitation. In these cell extracts, we detected
FOXM1 after immunoprecipitation with an OTUB1 antibody and
vice versa, but not with the control IgG, indicating that OTUB1
interacts with FOXM1 either directly or as part of a larger complex.
In addition, the co-immunoprecipitation studies also revealed that
the FOXM1-OTUB1 complexes were more abundant in the
MCF-7EpiR compared with MCF-7 cells (Figures 1a and b and
Supplementary Figure S1a). The FOXM1-OTUB1 interaction was
further conﬁrmed by the ability of FOXM1 to co-precipitate with a
transiently transfected Flag-tagged OTUB1 (Supplementary Figure
S1b). Epirubicin treatment caused a rapid decrease in the FOXM1OTUB1 interaction in the sensitive MCF-7 cells but the levels of
FOXM1-OTUB1 complexes were largely maintained or increased in
the resistant MCF-7EpiR cells (Figures 1c and d; also see Figure 3).
Given that OTUB1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes
polyubiquitin chains and promotes stability of target proteins,14–16
these data suggest that OTUB1 binds to FOXM1 and modulates its
ubiquitination and degradation in response to genotoxic treatment in breast cancer.

OTUB1 regulates FOXM1 expression in response to epirubicin in
breast cancer cells
To explore the potential regulation of FOXM1 by OTUB1 in
response to genotoxic agents, we investigated the expression of
OTUB1 and FOXM1 in the epirubicin-sensitive MCF-7 and
epirubicin-resistant MCF-7EpiR breast carcinoma cell lines following epirubicin treatment. Western blot results showed that both
OTUB1 and FOXM1 expressed at higher levels in the resistant
MCF-7EpiR cells compared with the parental MCF-7 cells. Moreover, both OTUB1 and FOXM1 decreased in expression levels in
response to epirubicin in the sensitive cells, but were moderately
induced in the resistant cells (Figure 2a). Consistently, the
expression of the FOXM1 downstream target cyclin B1 also
displayed a similar expression pattern as FOXM1 and OTUB1.
Furthermore, epirubicin treatment also induced the accumulation
of cleaved-PARP, indicative of apoptosis, in the sensitive MCF-7
but not in the resistant MCF-7EpiR cells, conﬁrming the differential
drug sensitivity of these MCF-7 cells. Tubulin was also immunoblotted for as a control to ensure equal loading. Next, we studied
the expression of OTUB1 and FOXM1 in response to another DNAdamaging agent, γ-irradiation. To this end, MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR
cells were harvested for western blot analysis at 24 h after
exposure to various doses of γ-irradiation (Figure 2b). The results
again revealed that the expression levels of OTUB1 and FOXM1
were higher in the resistant compared with the sensitive MCF-7
cells. Although γ-irradiation caused an induction in OTUB1 and a
corresponding increase in FOXM1 expression in a dose-dependent
manner in the MCF-7EpiR cells, the induction of OTUB1 by γirradiation were not matched by a similar induction of FOXM1
expression in the MCF-7 cells, which likely reﬂects the low baseline
levels of OTUB1 in MCF-7 cells. Nevertheless, the correlations
between the kinetics of OTUB1 and FOXM1 expression in the
sensitive and resistant MCF-7 cells in response to DNA-damaging
agents support the notion that OTUB1 restricts the downregulation of FOXM1 expression in response to DNA damage and
genotoxic agents.
FOXM1 expression is positively regulated by OTUB1 and
negatively by the proteasome pathway
To investigate the idea that OTUB1 modulates FOXM1 expression
further, we examined the effects of silencing OTUB1 and FOXM1
on the expression of endogenous OTUB1 and FOXM1 protein in
MCF-7 cells. The results showed that in MCF-7 cells OTUB1
depletion culminated in the downregulation of FOXM1, but not
vice versa (Figure 2c), suggesting that OTUB1 positively regulates
FOXM1 expression. In agreement, OTUB1 overexpression also
caused an increase in FOXM1 levels (Figure 2d). It is noteworthy
that depletion of FOXM1 had little effect on OTUB1 mRNA levels
(Supplementary Figure S2). Together these results suggest that
OTUB1 regulates FOXM1 expression primarily at the translational
or posttranslational levels (Figure 2d). The results also indicate that
OTUB1 has a role in modulating the steady-state level of the
FOXM1 protein.
Given that OTUB1 has been shown to restrict the ubiquitination
and proteasome degradation of target proteins in response to
DNA damage,17 we asked whether FOXM1 is also downregulated
through protein degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132
treatment on the expression of endogenous FOXM1 in the
absence or presence of epirubicin in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2e).
Treatment with MG132 essentially prevented the downregulation
in FOXM1 expression levels by epirubicin, indicating that the
downregulation of FOXM1 expression in response to epirubicin is,
at least partially, due to proteasomal degradation. It is also notable
that MG132 enhanced the expression of FOXM1 in untreated
cells, suggesting that FOXM1 is continuously downregulated by
proteasomal degradation at the steady state level.

OTUB1 binding promotes FOXM1 expression and attenuates
Lys-48 linked ubiquitination in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
We next examined whether OTUB1 binding is associated with the
suppression of FOXM1 ubiquitination and downregulation in the
epirubicin-sensitive and -resistant MCF-7 cells. To this end,
we studied by co-immunoprecipitation the levels of OTUB1
and ubiquitination chains associated with FOXM1 in MCF-7
and MCF-7R cells in response to epirubicin (Figure 3a and
Supplementary Figure S3). The result showed that epirubicin
treatment caused a prominent decrease in FOXM1 levels, which
was associated with decreased interactions with OTUB1 in the

sensitive MCF-7 cells. By contrast, FOXM1 protein levels and its
association with OTUB1 remained relatively constant in the resistant
cells upon epirubicin treatment. There was also an apparent loss of
polyubiquitin chains in the FOXM1 complexes upon epirubicin
treatment in the MCF-7 cells, but this is likely the result of a decline
in endogenous FOXM1 levels upon epirubicin treatment. However,
when we quantiﬁed the FOXM1 and Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin
conjugates from the same immunoprecipitates, we found that the
relative levels of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains co-precipitated
with FOXM1 actually increased with epirubicin treatment in MCF-7
cells (Figure 3b; Supplementary Figure S4). This induction in

Figure 2. FOXM1 correlates with OTUB1 expression in MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cells. (a) Protein expression levels of FOXM1, OTUB1, cyclin B1
and PARP in MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cell lines were examined by western blotting after epiribicin treatment at different time points indicated.
β-Tubulin was probed as a control for protein loading. Notably, there was cleavage of PARP in the sensitive and not resistant cells upon
epirubicin treatment. (b) Protein expression levels of FOXM1 and OTUB1 in MCF-7 and MCF-7EpiR cell lines were examined by western blotting
with speciﬁc antibodies as indicated 24 h after treatment with different doses of γ-irradiation as indicated. (c) The expression levels of FOXM1,
OTUB1 and β-tubulin were analysed by western blot analysis in MCF-7 cells transfected with the non-silencing control (NSC) siRNA, siRNA pool
against FOXM1 or siRNA pool targeting OTUB1. (d) The expression levels of FOXM1, OTUB1 and β-tubulin were examined by western blot
analysis in MCF-7 cells transfected with the empty expression vector pcDNA3, pcDNA3-FOXM1 or pcDNA3-Flag-tagged OTUB1. (e) The
expression levels of FOXM1 and β-tubulin were examined by western blot analysis in MCF-7 cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 in the presence or the absence of epirubicin for 24 h.

Lys48-linked polyubiquitination by epirubicin in MCF-7 cells was also
associated with a decline in the FOXM1-OTUB1 interaction and
FOXM1 expression in the MCF-7 cells. Quantiﬁcation of the immunoblot signals indicated the kinetics for the disassociation of
FOXM1-OTUB1 complexes occurred at a faster rate than the
downregulation of FOXM1 expression, indicating that OTUB1
disassociation precedes FOXM1 ubiquitination and degradation in
response to epirubicin in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3b). By comparison, the
relative levels of total and Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, FOXM1
protein and FOXM1-OTUB1 complexes remained relatively constant
in the resistant cells. It is noteworthy that the kinetics for Lys63linked polyubiquitin downregulation was similar to that of FOXM1
expression, indicating that the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains are
less likely to be involved in FOXM1 degradation in response to
epirubicin (Supplementary Figure S5). These results are consistent
with the notion that OTUB1 binds to FOXM1 and limits its
ubiquitination and degradation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
Polyubiquitin chains conjugated to FOXM1 are suppressed by
OTUB1
We next investigated whether the polyubiquitin chains detected
are directly conjugated to FOXM1. To conﬁrm direct covalent
Oncogene (2016) 1433 – 1444

linkage of Ubiquitin to FOXM1, we expressed a GFP-FOXM1 in the
presence or absence of a His-tagged Ubiquitin, and pulled down
the His-tagged ubiquitinated proteins under denaturing conditions after incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Figure 4a). The puriﬁed His-tagged Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins
were then immunoblotted with an anti-FOXM1 antibody,
which detected the Ubiquitin-conjugated forms of FOXM1 as
smears above the predicted GFP-FOXM1 molecular weight
of 160kDa, indicative of polyubiquitin chains. We next studied
by co-immunoprecipitation whether overexpression of OTUB1 can
repress the conjugation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which
are known to promote target protein degradation, on FOXM1 in
MCF-7 cells. The results showed that the FOXM1 immunoprecipitates contained higher levels of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains
in both untreated and epirubicin-treated MCF-7 cells when
compared with the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7EpiR cells and two
MCF-7 cell lines, one stably overexpressing OTUB1 and the other
Flag-OTUB1 (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure S6). The results
also demonstrated that the levels of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin
conjugates associated with FOXM1 increased upon epirubicin
treatment. We next investigated whether the deubiquitinase
activity of OTUB1 is required for FOXM1 stabilization and
K48-polyubiquitin chain formation. To achieve this, we transfected

Figure 3. The downregulation of FOXM1 expression by epirubicin is associated with a decrease in OTUB1 binding and an increase in Lys48linked polyubiquitin conjugates in MCF-7 cells. (a) Protein lysates prepared from MCF-7 and cells at 0, 6 and 24 h following treatment with
1 μM epirubicin were subjects to imnunoprecipitation with a FOXM1 antibody (αFOXM1). The Input and immunoprecipitates were then
analysed by western blot analysis using antibodies against Lys48-linked ubiquitin, OTUB1 and FOXM1. Representative co-immunprecipitation
results are shown. (b) The Lys48-linked polyubiquitin, OTUB1 and FOXM1 images were quantiﬁed using ImageJ analysis and plotted against
signals at 0 h. The ratios of Lys48-polyubiquitin- conjugated FOXM1 relative to FOXM1 precipitates were also shown. Data shown represent
the mean ± s.d. from three independent experiments. (t-test: 6 h or 24 h versus 0 h epirubicin treatment; *signiﬁcant Po 0.05, **very signiﬁcant
Po0.01, and ns: not signiﬁcant). ANOVA analysis was also performed on these data with post hoc test (Supplementary Figure S4).

MCF-7 with either the empty expression vector, wild-type (WT)
OTUB1, or the OTUB1(C91S) mutant and studied the levels of K48polyubiquitin chains associated with FOXM1 by immunoprecipitation (Figure4c). The FOXM1 co-immunoprecipitation analysis
showed that overexpression of OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S)
mutant, substantially depleted the levels of K48-polyubiquitin
chains and induced FOXM1 expression, particularly following
epirubicin treatment (Figure 4c). These results suggest that the
deubiquitinase activity of OTUB1 is required for the suppression of
Lys48-linked FOXM1 polyubiquitination chains and for enhancing
FOXM1 stability.
OTUB1 enhances FOXM1 stability in response to epirubicin
treatment
To examine the role of OTUB1 in regulating FOXM1 protein
stability, MCF-7 cells were transfected with either control vector,
OTUB1(WT) or OTUB1 (C91S, and subjected to treatment with
epirubicin and then the translation inhibitor cycloheximide
(Figure 5). Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by
© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited

cycloheximide caused a decline in FOXM1 protein levels in
MCF-7 cells treated with epirubicin. Under these conditions, the
rate of FOXM1 loss was reduced in MCF-7 cells transfected with
OTUB1(WT) compared with cells transfected with the empty
vector control. By contrast, the rates for the decline in FOXM1
levels were similar in MCF-7 cells transfected with the OTUB1
(C91S) mutant and the empty vector. These ﬁndings indicate that
the degradation of FOXM1 is impaired by overexpression of WT
OTUB1 but not a mutant that lacks catalytic activity. Conversely,
knockdown of OTUB1 by siRNA smart pool resulted in decreased
half-life of FOXM1 in MCF-7 cells treated with epirubicin compared
with cells transfected with non-silencing control siRNA. Together,
these results suggest that the suppression of FOXM1 degradation
by OTUB1 in response to epirubcin requires its deubiquitinating
catalytic activity, further conﬁrming that FOXM1 is a novel target
of the deubiquitinase OTUB1. As an internal control, we measured
the turnover of cyclin B1, a target of FOXM1 and not OTUB1, in
response to epirubicin treatment. Taken together, the results
provided strong evidence that OTUB1 suppresses FOXM1
ubiquitination and degraduation.

Figure 4. FOXM1 is modiﬁed by ubiquitination and its Lys48-linked polyubiquitin conjugates can be repressed by OTUB1. (a) MCF-7 cells were
co-transfected with eGFP-FOXM1 and His-Ubiquitin. Ubiquitinated proteins were puriﬁed using Ni2+-column afﬁnity pull-down under
denaturing conditions (guanidinium chloride). Input and His-tagged Ubiquitin pulled-down proteins were probed for FOXM1 using an antiFOXM1 antibody, and polyubiquitinated FOXM1 was detectable, demonstrating the covalent linkage of His-Ubiquitin to FOXM1. (b) MCF-7,
MCF-7EpiR, and OTUB1 and Flag-OTUB1 stably expressing MCF-7 cells were treated with 1 μM epirubicin for 0 h or 24 h and 1 μM MG132 for 6 h
and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with an FOXM1 antibody. Inputs (1/10 of IP) and IP products with control IgG and the FOXM1
antibody were resolved on western blot and probed for Lys48-linked polyubiquitin conjugates and FOXM1. The Inputs were also
immunoblotted for FOXM1, OTUB1, β-tubulin and Flag-OTUB1 (anti-Fiag or αFlag) with the respective antibodies. (c) MCF-7 cells transfected
with control pcDNA3, Flag-OTUB1(WT) or the Flag-tagged catalytically dead mutant OTUB1(C91S) were treated with 1 μM epirubicin for 0 h or
24 h, 10 μM MG132 for 6 h and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with an FOXM1 antibody and western blotted with speciﬁc antibodies
as in (c).

Figure 5. OTUB1 supresses the degradation of FOXM1 in epirubicin-treated MCF-7 cells. (a) MCF-7 cells transfected with control non-silencing
siRNA or Smart Pool siRNA targeting OTUB1 were treated with 1 μM epirubicin for 16 h. These epirubicin-treated MCF-7 cells were then treated
with cycloheximide, and protein lysates prepared from 0 to 8 h following cyclohexamide treatment. Protein expression levels of FOXM1,
OTUB1, β-tubulin and cyclin B1 in these MCF-7 lysates were examined by western blotting. Densitometry was used to quantify the FOXM1 and
β-tubulin levels from which independent background readings were subtracted. Western blots are representative of three independent
experiments. The relative expression levels shown (right panels) are means ± s.e.m. of the ratios of FOXM1 to β-tubulin levels relative to those
at 0 h. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t-test (*Pp0.05, signiﬁcant; ns, non-signiﬁcant). In (b) and (c), MCF-7 cells
transfected with control pcDNA3 and (b) Flag-OTUB1(WT) or (c) the mutant Flag-OTUB1(C91S) were treated and analysed as in (a).

signiﬁcantly enhanced MCF-7 cell proliferation, whereas OTUB1
depletion decreased the rates of proliferation of MCF-7 cells
(Supplementary Figure S7). Furthermore, we also found that
OTUB1 overexpression enhanced the resistance of MCF-7 cells to
epirubicin (Supplementary Figure S7). Conversely, OTUB1 silencing
potentiated the anti-proliferative function of epirubicin in MCF-7
cells (Supplementary Figure S7). We next tested whether FOXM1
has a role in the cell-proliferative and epirubicin-resistant
functions of OTUB1. To this end, we transfected WT and
Foxm1−/− mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) with either the empty
expression vector, OTUB1(WT), or the OTUB1(C91S) mutant and
examined their effects on cell proliferation and epirubicin
resistance by SRB assay. Overexpression of OTUB1, but not the
OTUB1(C91S) mutant, signiﬁcantly enhanced the cell proliferation
as well as the viability of WT MEFs in response to epirubicin
(Figure 6). By contrast, there were no signiﬁcant differences in cell
proliferation rates and epirubicin sensitivity in FOXM1-deﬁcent
MEFs transfected with vector control, OTUB1 and the OTUB1
(C91S) mutant. In addition, clonogenic assays showed that at 0, 20
and 40 nM epirubicin, the colony formation capacity of WT MEFs
transfected with WT OTUB1 was signiﬁcantly enhanced when
compared with MEFs transfected with empty expression vector or
the OTUB1(C91S) mutant (Figure 7). Similar to the cell proliferation

data, there were no appreciable differences in clonogenicity in
Foxm1−/− MEFs transfected with empty vector control, WT OTUB1
and the mutant OTUB1(C91S). These results indicate that FOXM1 is
a key target of OTUB1 and that FOXM1 mediates the oncogenic
and DNA damage resistant functions of OTUB1.
Correlation between OTUB1 and FOXM1 expression in breast
cancer patient samples
To establish further the physiological signiﬁcance and clinical
relevance of the regulation of FOXM1 by OTUB1 in breast cancer,
FOXM1 and OTUB1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 116 breast cancer patient samples (Figure 8). OTUB1
was predominantly expressed in cytoplasm, consistent with its
function as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Immunohistochemical
analysis results showed that OTUB1 expression signiﬁcantly
correlated with FOXM1 expression (Chi-square test, P = 0.034).
There was also signiﬁcant correlation between OTUB1 and
oestrogen receptor (ER)α observed in our cohort (Supplementary
Figure S8), consistent with the previous ﬁnding that OTUB1 could
deubiquitinate and inhibit the degradation of ERα.18 However,
there were no signiﬁcant correlations between OTUB1 and other
clinicopathological parameters including progesterone status,

(a) Twenty-four hours after transfection, protein lysates were prepared from these cells and then analysed for the expression of FOXM1,
OTUB1 and β-Tubulin. (b) Twenty-four hours after transfection, aliquots of the transfected cells were split into 96 well plates and their

2000 cells were seeded in six-well plates, treated with 0, 20 or 40 nM of epirubicn, grown for 15 days and then stained with crystal violet (top

histological type, lymph node involvement and tumour stage
(Supplementary Figure S8). Intriguingly, survival analysis showed
no signiﬁcant correlation between OTUB1 expression and patients’
survival (Supplementary Figure S9). In agreement with our survival
data, analysis of OTUB1 transcript expression in a previously
published cohort (3455 breast cancer patients)19 also revealed
that OTUB1 mRNA expression level was not signiﬁcantly
associated with poor survival (P = 0.42 for overall survival,
Kaplan–Meier analysis) (Supplementary Figure S10). However, in
another published cohort of 1926 cases of lung cancer,19
OTUB1 mRNA expression level was a signiﬁcant poor prognostic
marker (P = 0.0025 for overall survival, Kaplan–Meier analysis)
(Supplementary Figure S11). The discrepancy between breast
cancer and other cancer types is likely because OTUB1 substrates,
in particular ERα, have a particularly essential role in breast cancer
initiation, progression and treatment. Although ERα signalling
promotes breast cancer proliferation, expression of ERα is also
associated with good prognosis because these patients are likely
to beneﬁt from endocrine therapy. Moreover, in our tissue
microarray cohort, tumour stage and lymph node involvement
were signiﬁcantly associated with poor survival (P = 0.007 and
P = 0.017, respectively, for overall survival; P = 0.001 and P = 0.01,
respectively, for disease-speciﬁc survival, refer to cox regression
univariate analysis table) (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12).
Therefore, to remove the interferences of the clinicopathological
parameters on the survival analysis of OTUB1, multivariate
analyses using Cox regression model were performed. In multivariate analysis, OTUB1 expression became signiﬁcantly associated
with poor survival after being adjusted for the clinicopathological
parameters, including ER status, progesterone status, tumour
stage, histological type and lymph-node involvement (P = 0.033,
relative risk = 2.859 for overall survival and P = 0.013, relative
risk = 4.048 for disease-speciﬁc survival) (Supplementary Figure
S11). In this cohort, 60% of patients received chemotherapy. For
this subgroup of patients, elevated OTUB1 was also signiﬁcantly
associated with poor survival after being adjusted for all the

clinicopathological parameters (P = 0.032, relative risk = 3.822 for
overall survival and P = 0.032, relative risk = 3.822 for diseasespeciﬁc survival) (Supplementary Figure S12). As resistance to
chemotherapy is known to be associated with poorer survival, the
results from cox regression analysis supported a role of OTUB1 in
chemotherapy resistance. This is consistent with our previous
study showing that FOXM1 overexpression confers resistance to
genotoxic chemotherapy.9 Collectively, these data suggest that
OTUB1 overexpression is associated with chemotherapeutic drug
resistance, and this is likely to be mediated by promoting FOXM1
protein expression through supressing its ubiquitination and
degradation.
DISCUSSION
FOXM1 has an essential function in enhancing DNA damage repair
and genotoxic agent resistance.5,8–10 Previous research has also
demonstrated that OTUB1 can modulate DNA damage response
by promoting protein deubiquitination.17 We show, in here, that
OTUB1 can promote deubiquitination and stabilization of FOXM1
in response to the genotoxic agent epirubicin in breast cancer.
Here, we also report that FOXM1 is conjugated with Lys48linked polyubiquitin chains. FOXM1 expression is downregulated
in response to epirubicin treatment in MCF-7 cells. This ﬁnding is
consistent with the established concept that proteins with Lys48linked polyubiquitin chains are generally targeted for proteasomedependent degradation.20–27 Different OTU family proteins have
certain speciﬁcity towards distinct types of ubiquitin linkages.28
For example, OTUB1 preferentially targets polyubiquitin chains
joined by Lys48 bonds, while OTUB2 has speciﬁcity towards chains
associated through Lys63.28
In concordance, our data demonstrate that OTUB1 overexpression represses the conjugation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin
chains on FOXM1 and impairs its degradation, thus promoting
resistance to genotoxic agents. Our previous study shows that
SUMOylation inhibits FOXM1 activity, promotes its ubiquitination

and enhances its cytoplasmic translocation as well as degradation.10
Thus, deubiquitination of FOXM1 may not only result in the
stabilization of FOXM1 but may also promote its nuclear
retention.10
In addition to its function as a deubiquitinase, previous studies
have shown that OTUB1 can suppress ubiquitination by inhibiting
the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes independently of its
catalytic activity. For example, OTUB1 suppresses RNF168-dependent
Oncogene (2016) 1433 – 1444

polyubiquitination independently of its catalytic activity. Accordingly, OTUB1 binds to and inhibits UBC13 (UBE2N), the cognate E2
enzyme for RNF168.17 OTUB1 also suppresses UBCH5 E2 enzyme
and stabilizes the p53 protein.14,29 However, we demonstrate here
that OTUB1 suppresses the ubiquitination and degradation of
FOXM1 through its deubiquitinase enzymatic activity. Our data
show that WT OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S) catalytic dead
mutant, can enhance the stability of FOXM1 in response to

1443
epirubicin in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the deubiquitinase
activity is required for the degradation of FOXM1. The fact that
OTUB1 interacts with FOXM1 also supports that FOXM1 deubiquitination occurs through a catalytic mechanism, that requires
interactions with OTUB1.
The physiological relevance of the regulation of FOXM1 by
OTUB1 is underscored by the strong and signiﬁcant association
between FOXM1 and OTUB1 in breast cancer patient samples.
Despite not being an independent prognostic marker in Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis, OTUB1 is signiﬁcantly associated with
poorer prognosis in multivariate regression analysis, particularly in
breast cancer patients who have received chemotherapy. This
argues that OTUB1 is likely to be linked to chemotherapy
sensitivity in breast cancer. In agreement, the overexpression of
OTUB1 has been shown to be associated with poorer outcome
and cancer progression. For example, OTUB1 is associated with
metastasis and is a predictive marker of poor prognosis in
colorectal cancer.30,31 In addition, OTUB1 promotes tumourigenesis and cell invasion in prostate cancer.32
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis shows that OTUB1 expression is
not correlated with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients,
even though OTUB1 is a predictor for prognosis in patients with
other malignancies, such as colorectal cancer.30,31 Similarly,
despite OTUB1 mRNA level being a prognostic marker for lung
cancer patients, its expression has no predictive value for patients
diagnosed with breast cancer. This is likely to be due to the
complex role played by OTUB1 in breast cancer, as it regulates the
expression and activity of a variety of substrate proteins with
diverse and sometimes opposing functions in breast cancer
initiation, progression and treatment. OTUB1 may also affect the
stability of proteins, which contribute towards breast cancer
progression and treatment. For example, OTUB1 has been
reported to be an ERα-interacting protein. OTUB1 can suppress
ubiquitination and stabilize the expression of ERα in the chromatin
and thereby, negatively regulate its transcription.18 In agreement,
we also found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between OTUB1
expression and ER status in our study (Supplementary Figure S8).
While ERα signalling has a key role in stimulating initial breast
cancer cell proliferation during tumourigenesis, the expression of
ERα is also an indication of a good outcome in breast cancer
patients as ERα-positive patients can often be treated with
endocrine therapy.33 Another OTUB1 target in breast cancer is
the tumour suppressor p53. In response to DNA-damaging agents,
OTUB1 can stabilize and activate p53, leading to the inhibition of
cell proliferation and apoptosis.14,29 However, p53 expression and
function is commonly lost during tumourigenesis and thus, the
role of OTUB1 in the subsequent breast cancer progression and
drug resistance will not be clear-cut.34,35
The ﬁnding that overexpression of OTUB1 has a prominent role
in promoting cell proliferation and drug resistance suggests that
OTUB1 is a potent oncogene. This is further supported by the fact
that overexpression of OTUB1 is associated with poorer prognosis
in many malignancies.30–32 However, except for ERα, few
oncogenes have been identiﬁed to be substrates of OTUB1.18 In
here, we not only show that the potent oncogene FOXM1 is a
target of OTUB1 but also present evidence to demonstrate that
the oncogenic and genotoxic functions of OTUB1 depend on the
expression of a functional FOXM1, suggesting that OTUB1
promotes cell proliferation and epirubicin resistance predominantly through targeting FOXM1.
Collectively, these results provide strong evidence to suggest
that not only OTUB1 deubiquitinase activity prevents the
proteasomal degradation of FOXM1 upon epirubicin treatment,
OTUB1 also regulates steady-state expression of FOXM1. Consistent with the emerging oncogenic role of OTUB1 in cancer, the
proliferative and clonogenic assays also show that OTUB1 can
enhance the proliferative rate and genotoxic agent resistance of
© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited

breast cancer cells and that FOXM1 is a crucial substrate of OTUB1
in cancer cell proliferation and genotoxic agent resistance.
