ABSTRACT
Glucocorticoids are among the most effective anti-inflammatory drugs, and are
widely used for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, chronic treatment with glucocorticoids
results in multiple side effects. Thus, there was an intensive search for selective
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activators (SEGRA), which retain therapeutic potential
of glucocorticoids, but with fewer adverse effects. GR regulates gene expression by
transactivation (TA), by binding as homodimer to gene promoters, or transrepression
(TR), via diverse mechanisms including negative interaction between monomeric GR and
other transcription factors. It is well accepted that metabolic and atrophogenic effects
of glucocorticoids are mediated by GR TA. Here we summarized the results of extensive
international collaboration that led to discovery and characterization of Compound A
(CpdA), a unique SEGRA with a proven “dissociating” GR ligand profile, preventing GR
dimerization and shifting GR activity towards TR both in vitro and in vivo. We outlined
here the unusual story of compound’s discovery, and presented a comprehensive
overview of CpdA ligand properties, its anti-inflammatory effects in numerous animal
models of inflammation and autoimmune diseases, as well as its anti-cancer effects.
Finally, we presented mechanistic analysis of CpdA and glucocorticoid effects in skin,
muscle, bone, and regulation of glucose and fat metabolism to explain decreased CpdA
side effects compared to glucocorticoids. Overall, the results obtained by our and other
laboratories underline translational potential of CpdA and its derivatives for treatment
of inflammation, autoimmune diseases and cancer.

especially for the treatment of patients with hematological
malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma).
Unfortunately chronic treatment with Gcs is
associated with multiple adverse effects, including
altered glucose metabolism, steroid-induced diabetes,
osteoporosis, skin and muscle atrophy, alteration of
behavior and mood. These clinical conditions motivated
the active development of selective GR activators
(SEGRA), novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands
that preserve the therapeutic activity of Gcs, with fewer

INTRODUCTION
Synthetic glucocorticoids (Gcs) are the most
frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs, and
have been used worldwide in the treatment of asthma,
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease,
psoriasis, and other inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases since early 1960s [1–3]. They are also extensively
used as immunosupressants in the clinical management
of organ transplantation, and as anti-cancer drugs,

adverse effects. Many candidate SEGRA molecules have
been synthesized by industry and academia or identified by
chemical library screening, with some, such as Mapracorat
and PF-04171327, having reached clinical trials [4–10].
This review is focused on Compound A (CpdA), a
non-steroidal SEGRA, which is a stable synthetic analogue
of a natural compound found in Salsola tuberculatiformis
Botschantzev (Fig. 1). We discuss the unusual history
of CpdA discovery, its GR ligand properties, antiinflammatory and anti-cancer effects along with decreased
metabolic and atrophogenic side effects, as compared to
classical Gcs.

member of this genus indeed contains active contraceptive
compound(s). The chemical nature of these natural
products has however, baffled scientists over many years.
In 1961 de Lange described a rare syndrome of
prolonged gestation which sporadically occurred among
Karakul sheep in the Keetmanshoop district in Namibia [13].
Salsola tuberculata, later renamed Salsola tuberculatiformis
Botschantzev was subsequently identified to be responsible
for this syndrome [14] [15]. This shrub is also known to
local inhabitants as “gannabos”. In our investigations,
using various derivatizing reagents to isolate the labile
compounds in the form of their stabilized derivatives,
we showed that treatment with trimethylammonium
acetyl hydrazide chloride (Girard-T reagent), used for the
isolation of aldehydes and ketones [16], removed all the
contraceptive activity from active plant extracts [17]. The
derivatives formed in this manner were isolated by solvent
partitioning and then decomposed under acidic conditions
to yield three compounds in pure form (Fig. 1A–1C).
These compounds were identified by proton NMR and
EI-mass spectrometry as 4-hydroxy-acetophenone (Fig. 1A),
4-hydroxy-3-methoxy- acetophenone (Fig. 1B) and
4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde (Fig. 1C) [17]. Although synthetic
samples of both ketones did show some biological activity

DISCOVERY OF COMPOUND A
Plants belonging to the genus Salsola (Family:
Chenopodiaceae) are found in the arid and semi-arid
regions of our planet with more than 60 different Salsola
species found in Namibia and in the Republic of South
Africa [11]. This genus is first mentioned in San folklore
as traditional medicinal plants with Salsola aqueous
extracts being used as oral contraceptives by San women
[12]. During the investigation of the unusual biological
effects of Salsola, it was confirmed that at least one

in rats, neither A or B, nor a mixture of A+B, could, at the
levels found in the extract, account for the contraceptive
activity of the plant. The aldehyde (Fig. 1C) was inactive.
In later experiments without derivatizing reagents, we were
able to isolate another pure compound which consistently
appeared in active fractions. The compound was identified
by NMR, UV and EI-mass spectrometry as 1-(4- hydroxy
phenyl)-2-methyl-aminoethanol or synephrine (Fig. 1D).
This structure was subsequently confirmed by spectroscopic
comparison with synthetic compounds as well as by the
preparation of the same acylated derivatives from natural and
synthetic material. Synthetic synephrine did not, however,
show biological activity similar to that of the active plant
extract.
These data suggested that compounds identified
in active Salsola extracts probably arose as breakdown
products from one or more, yet unknown, active
precursor(s), pointing to the presence of phenolic
compound(s) that contained a labile functional group. The
labile group apparently decomposed under appropriate
conditions to aldehydes, ketones or alcohols. Our results
further suggested that the long duration of the biological
tests for contraceptive activity was not compatible with
the testing of the active compound(s), necessitating a more
rapid and sensitive screening method for the evaluation of
plant extracts or fractions. We developed a micro-assay
based on the interference of the test compound with the
substrate-induced difference spectrum of sheep adrenal
cytochrome P450-dependent steroid 11β-hydroxylase
(CYP11B1), the enzyme catalyzing the biosynthesis
of cortisol and corticosterone from deoxycortisol and
deoxycorticosterone, respectively [18–21]. We isolated
a single compound to homogeneity using this assay and
named it S2 [21]. Structure determination by NMR and
mass spectrometry indicated the presence of an unstable
aziridine, after which we subsequently synthesized a more
stable aziridine precursor, Compound A (CpdA, Fig. 1E).
We showed that CpdA, similar to extracts prepared
from dried plant material, caused contraception in rats
[20] and interacted with two glucocorticoid-binding
proteins: CYP11B1 and corticosteroid-binding globulin
in plasma (CBG), while also being able to displace Gcs
from CBG [22]. The fact that CpdA interacted with Gcsbinding proteins, suggested that it could also bind to GR,
a well known transcription factor (TF) that mediates the
biological effects of glucocorticoid hormones [23–25].

a conserved central DNA-binding domain with
dimerization and nuclear localization sequences, and a
conserved C-terminal ligand-binding domain [26–29].
In the absence of Gcs, the GR resides in
cytoplasm bound to chaperones: heat shock proteins and
immunophillins that control GR nuclear import [30, 31].
Upon Gcs binding, the GR translocates to the nucleus,
where it regulates gene expression via (i) transactivation
(TA), that requires GR-homodimer binding to
palindromic glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE),
and (ii)  transrepression (TR), mediated via different
mechanisms including negative interaction between GR
and other TFs, such as NF-κB, AP-1, p53, STATs, IRF-3,
CREB [12, 26–28, 32–34]. This interaction may occur
in the nucleus or, as we have reported, in the cytoplasm
[35], and does not require GR dimerization, as it could be
mediated by the monomeric GR [26–28, 33, 36].
We and others reported that CpdA acts as a GR
ligand. It binds to the GR with high affinity, with IC50
in the nM range, as determined by competitive ligand–
binding assays in human and rodent cells expressing
endogenous GR [35–37]. The effects of CpdA on major
steps of GR activation: phosphorylation, dimerization,
nuclear translocation and GR-DNA binding have been
extensively studied. We showed, in fibroblasts, epithelial
and lymphoid cells with endogenous or exogenous GR,
that CpdA induced modest GR nuclear translocation [35,
37, 39]. Using different approaches including fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET), we and others
discovered that CpdA, unlike Gcs, did not elicit ligandinduced GR dimerization [35–38]. Furthermore, CpdA did
not induce GR phosphorylation at Ser211, critical for GR
TA activity [37]. Consequently, CpdA did not significantly
affect or even inhibited constitutive and Gcs-induced GR
DNA binding and activation of endogenous genes and
GRE.Luciferase reporters [35–37, 39]. In contrast, CpdA
and classical Gcs have remarkably similar TR profiles,
suppressing the activity of many pro-proliferative and
anti-apoptotic TFs. Depending on cell context, CpdA has
been shown to inhibit NF-κB, AP-1, Ets-1, Elk-1, SRF,
NFATc [35, 37, 39]. Using cells with GR knockdown
or lacking GR, we proved that CpdA inhibitory effects
on TFs are GR-dependent [35, 37, 39]. Interestingly,
in contrast to Gcs that usually do not interfere with TF
nuclear translocation, CpdA significantly decreased/
delayed nuclear import of NF-κB and AP-1 proteins
[35, 40].
The global effect of CpdA and the glucocorticoids
on gene expression was compared by DNA array analyses
in A549 lung carcinoma and Granta-519 lymphoma cells
with endogenous GR; and in prostate cancer LNCaP-GR
cells stably expressing exogenous GR. In both, epithelial
and lymphoid cells, molecular TA signatures of CpdA and
the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), were
different. In fact, CpdA was able to activate only 7–11% of
the genes induced by Dex in LNCaP-GR and Granta-519
cells (Fig. 2). However, their effects on the GR TR branch

were much more similar − CpdA was able to inhibit
the expression of 31% and 66% of genes negatively
regulated by Dex in lymphoma and prostate cancer cells,
respectively (Fig. 2), and suppressed 32% of the genes
negatively regulated by Dex in A549 lung cells [41]. In
summary, our validated microarray results (Supplementary
Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; NCBI arrays with
access numbers GSE71102 (LNCaP-GR) and GSE71099
(Granta-519) confirmed at global level the unique CpdA
capability to dissociate GR TA and TR functions, and to
shift GR function towards TR.
In addition to its function as a SEGRA, CpdA acts
as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Even
though CpdA has a lower affinity for the AR compared to
active androgens, CpdA induced considerable AR nuclear
translocation [35, 42]. We and others showed that CpdA
repressed the interaction between the NH(2)- and COOHterminal domains of the AR critical for its function, and
inhibited both constitutive and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)induced AR-DNA binding and AR transcription activity in
Luciferase reporter assays [35, 42]. These results suggest
that the interaction of CpdA with the AR closely resembles
the effects of well characterized anti-androgens, such as
Casodex. CpdA did not significantly affect the activity of

other steroid hormone receptors such as mineralcorticoid,
progesterone, and estrogen receptors [36, 37].
It is important to note that CpdA is also
characterized by its own molecular signature component,
and regulated a subset of genes that were not affected by
Gcs ([41], GEO submissions GSE71102 and GSE71099).
Whether these genes were regulated via GR/AR remains
to be investigated. Nevertheless, the therapeutic activity
of CpdA was mostly mediated via GR or AR steroid
receptors as discussed below.

THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CPDAPOTENTIAL CLINICAL BENEFITS
Our findings have contributed to the understanding
of the significance of GR TR mechanisms in the antiinflammatory and anti-cancer effects of Gcs [43–46]. In
contrast, GR TA is proposed to underlie many adverse
metabolic effects of Gcs [46–50]. Even though some genes
activated by Gcs (such as DUSP1/MKP1, GILZ, IκBa)
are involved in anti-inflammatory responses, while other
genes inhibited by Gcs/GR (adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) or collagens) are involved in steroidal side effects,
it is now well established in the field that GR ligands,

which do not support GR dimerization and predominantly
activate the TR branch of GR signaling, should have a
better therapeutic index than classical Gcs [36, 50–52].
Indeed, it is believed that GR ligands that “dissociate”
GR TR from GR TA will retain the therapeutic activity
of classical steroids, but will have reduced adverse side
effects regarding bone, glucose and lipid metabolism.
Thus, based on its GR ligand profile, CpdA was expected
to exert pronounced anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer
effects, while inducing fewer adverse effects typical for
the classical synthetic Gcs that often limit their therapeutic
applications. As discussed below, we had also anticipated
that, compared to Gcs, CpdA would be less likely to
induce patient resistance to GR-targeted therapy [39, 106].

CpdA has also been shown to ameliorate muscle
pathology in mdx mice, an animal model for Duchene
muscular dystrophy associated with abnormal muscle
inflammation and activation of NF-κB. CpdA treatment
for a period of 2 months, normalized limb strength and
function and attenuated cathepsin-B enzyme activity
(a surrogate marker for inflammation) [67].
Mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory effects of CpdA
At molecular level, the anti-inflammatory effects
of CpdA were mediated mostly through blockage of
inflammatory TFs including NF-κB, T-bet, STAT6, the
latter being central to the Th2-driven asthma model [61,
66, 68], which resulted in strong inhibition of expression
of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
characteristic for each specific model. For example, in
the zymosan-induced paw inflammation model, the antiinflammatory effect of CpdA was associated with the
down-regulation of TNF-α-induced- and NF-κB-dependent
pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-6, E-selectine, IL-8 and
others [37]. In the model of experimental colitis induced
by trinitrobenzene sulfonic  acid, CpdA reduced the
production of colonic TNF-α, IL-1, and COX-2 at mRNA
level [69].
In models of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
autoimmune neuritis (EAN), and asthma, CpdA inhibited
the expression of both Th1/Th17 and Th2 cytokines [38,
62–66, 70–72]. In mice with EAE, for instance, CpdA was
able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and attenuated
EAE symptoms via the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear
translocation and the expression of NF-κB-driven  proinflammatory cytokines (INF-γ; IL-1β; TNF-α; IL-23;
IL-17 and others) in the central nerve system [63]. In
the Th2 asthma model, CpdA’s effects were mediated by
the inhibition of TNF-α and Th2 inflammatory cytokines
(IL-4, IL-5, IL-6) as well as blockage of NF-κB activity in
lung [66]. In the model of Duchene muscular dystrophy,
CpdA reduced expression of IL-6, CCL2, IFNγ, TNF-α, and
IL-12p70 cytokines in muscle [67]. Interestingly, in
models of inflammatory type 1 diabetes and autoimmune
neuritis, CpdA, in addition to its inhibitory effect on
Th1/Th17 cytokines, was able to switch Th1/Th17
differentiation towards anti-inflammatory T regulatory
(Treg) cell differentiation, an important mechanism for
the resolving of inflammation [65, 73].
The molecular mechanisms of CpdA effects on
NF-κB activation and the expression of inflammatory
cytokines have been further corroborated in vitro, in
cell lines and in primary cell cultures including mouse
microglia and astrocytes, as well as synoviocytes from
patients with rheumatoid arthritis [63, 70]. In most
experiments, cells were activated by TNF-α or LPS to
induce cytokine expression. Alternatively, HepG2 human
liver cells were infected with Dengue virus to induce
inflammatory cytokines and to model the “cytokine storm”
that underlies the pathogenesis of Dengue hemorrhagic

Anti-inflammatory effects of compound A
Gcs remain a gold standard as anti-inflammatory
drugs. They are effective against a wide range of
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases characterized by
the different types of CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes.
Th1 cells producing interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-2,
transcription factor T-bet, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF),
as well as Th17 cells producing IL-17, are all implicated
in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders including
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus
type 1; inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease) and
acute organ rejection [53–61]. Th2 cells that produce IL-4,
IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 are mostly responsible
for atopic disorders (such as atopic dermatitis, rhinitis,
asthma), and allergies [54–60]. It is well known that Gcs
can block both Th1/Th17 and Th2 inflammatory responses
as well as inflammatory factors, such as NF-κB, central for
the production of cytokines and chemokines involved in
the activation and differentiation of Th cells.
The therapeutic activity of CpdA was extensively
tested in comparison with Gcs by us and other research
groups in various Th1/Th17 and Th2 in vivo models of
inflammation (Table 1). In the Th1/Th17 models, which
included zymozan paw inflammation, collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA), experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN)
and encephalomyelitis (EAE), type 1 diabetes and acute
colitis, CpdA inhibited the development of clinical
symptoms and morphological manifestations of disease,
such as paw swelling, inflammation in joints, colon,
pancreas, central nerve system and peripheral nerves [37,
38, 62–66]. CpdA also reduced neuronal damage and
demyelination, as well as progression of neuropathic pain
[65]. Furthermore, in the predominantly Th2-driven mouse
asthma model, CpdA reduced inflammation and airway
hyper-responsiveness [66]. In all the aforementioned
models, CpdA decreased both the severity of localized
clinical symptoms and the systemic signs of inflammation.
However, CpdA doses in most studies were ~10-fold
higher compared to Gcs, possibly due to a lower GR
affinity and the non-steroidal nature of the compound
[26, 33, 37].

lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma as well as
melanoma cell lines (Table 2). The anti-cancer effect of
CpdA was GR-dependent, and in cancer cells with GR
knockdown, CpdA was significantly less toxic (Table 2)
[35, 39, 83]. In prostate cancer cell models, the cytotoxic
concentrations of CpdA were in the range of 10−5 to 10−6 M,
in standard growth and apoptosis tests inmonolayer
cultures as well as in colony-forming assays (Fig. 3A
and [35, 83]). Moreover, using prostate cancer cells with
different AR and GR status, we demonstrated clearly that
CpdA could exert its cytostatic effect via both receptors
which correlated with CpdA’s dual GR/AR ligand
properties shown in our earlier studies [35].
The leukemia and lymphoma cells appeared to be far
more sensitive to CpdA than epithelial cancer cells. CpdA
was equally or more potent than Gcs in the inhibition of
growth and survival of transformed lymphoid cell lines, as
well as in primary cell cultures from acute T cell leukemia
patients [39].
We subsequently used human cancer cells
xenografts to assess the anti-cancer activity of CpdA
in vivo (Figs. 3B and 3C), and demonstrated that CpdA
inhibited growth of PC3 prostate cancer cell xenografts
by 40% and Granta-519 mantle cell lymphoma xenografts
by 70% when used at doses ~ 8–10 μg/animal, which were
lower than the anti-inflammatory doses of CpdA [37, 63].
As mentioned above, Gcs are mostly used in
combination anti-cancer therapies, frequently with
proteasome inhibitors such as Bortezomib (BZ) - a
proteasome inhibitor approved by FDA in 2003 for the
treatment of hematological malignancies [84, 85]. While
the biological effects of GR ligands depend on GR levels,
proteasome inhibitors are known to stabilize the GR and to

fever [74]. The aforementioned experiments demonstrated
that CpdA inhibited NF-κB and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in a GR-dependent fashion, and
confirmed that CpdA acts as “dissociated” GR ligand, as
it was incapable of activating GR target genes, such as
DUSP1/MKP1, GILZ, FKBP51 [38, 62, 65, 69, 70].
Interestingly, in vitro experiments confirmed that CpdA,
in contrast to Gcs, can do both: inhibit expression of
inflammatory cytokines and induce the expression of antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 [65].

Anti-cancer effects of Compound A as a monotherapy and in combination with proteasome
inhibitors
Gcs usually promote cell differentiation and inhibit
proliferation, and have proven anti-cancer activity
[44, 45, 75, 76]. Synthetic Gcs have been extensively
used clinically against leukemia, lymphomas, and
multiple myeloma. The steroids are typically paired
with traditional chemotherapies (cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate), and newer
(proteasome inhibitors) agents [77–80]. Gcs are also used
in combination therapy of patients with epithelial cancers,
mostly for palliative treatment of metastasis-related pain,
decreasing nausea and other side effects of chemotherapy
[81]. However, in some cases they have been used as anticancer drugs, and even as a mono-therapy, as in the case
of elderly patients with prostate cancer [82].
In contrast to anti-inflammatory effects, the anticancer effects of CpdA were uncovered more recently. Our
findings showed that CpdA inhibited growth and viability
of numerous cancer cells including prostate cancer,

Cancer cells and non-transformed cells of the same origin were treated with CpdA or vehicle, and the cytotoxic effect was
evaluated by cell counting as described [35, 39, 83]. The cytotoxic effect is depicted + (25%)/ ++ (30–50%)/ +++ (>50%)

prevent Gcs-induced GR degradation [86, 87]. We showed
that BZ indeed induced GR accumulation in lymphoma,
leukemia and prostate cancer cells, and enhanced CpdA’s
profile as a dissociated GR ligand further shifting GR
signaling to TR [35, 39, 83]. Moreover, we showed that BZ
sensitized lymphoma and prostate cancer cells to CpdA,
and we revealed a pronounced GR-dependent cooperative
CpdA and BZ anti-cancer effect [35, 39, 83]. Similar results
were obtained in multiple myeloma cells MM.1S expressing

endogenous functional GR, in which the anti-cancer effects
of CpdA and BZ were also synergistic [39].
The mechanisms of anti-cancer effect of CpdA
There is growing evidence that, in parallel with
inhibition of growth and survival, Gcs launch an antiapoptotic program and, under certain conditions, can
even protect cancer cells from chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis [81, 88–91]. We and others have reported that
30737

Gcs can activate inhibitors of apoptosis IAPs, MAP kinase
phosphatase DUSP1/MKP1 (resulting in AP1 inhibition),
pro-survival serum and glucocorticoid-inducible protein
kinase SGK1, as well as increasing the expression of antiapoptotic genes from the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl)
[83, 88–90, 92]. In addition, we showed that Gcs prevent
BZ-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in prostate
cancer cells [83].
CpdA on the other hand, in contrast to Gcs did not
induce an anti-apoptotic self-defense program in cancer
cells. Moreover, CpdA enhanced lethal BZ-induced ER
stress [83]. Our findings highlighted the potential benefits
of combining a SEGRA such as CpdA with proteasome
inhibitors to trigger the maximal potential of anti-cancer
GR signaling.

syndrome, diabetes, glaucoma, osteoporosis, muscle and
skin atrophy, decreased wound healing, changes in mood
and central nervous system functions, growth retardation
in pediatric patients, and infertility. Many of these
effects are severe and sometimes irreversible [98–100].
A considerable number of metabolic and atrophogenic
effects of Gcs are due to their catabolic activity in
peripheral organs/tissues, in which protein degradation
and lipolysis are induced to stimulate glucocneogenesis
in liver and to maintain high blood glucose levels
[12,  46]. These effects involve activation of genes
encoding gluconeogenetic enzymes, such as glucose6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(PEPCK), tyrosine aminotransferase as well as fatty acid
synthase [12, 46, 64], linking many adverse Gcs effects to
GR TA. In addition, we and others found that the induction
of GR target gene REDD1 (regulated in development and
DNA damage response 1) is central to the atrophogenic
effects of Gcs in skin, subcutaneous adipose and muscle
[101, 102]. Importantly, REDD1 KO animals appeared to
be protected against Gcs-induced skin atrophy and muscle
waste [101, 103].
Although CpdA side effects during chronic in vivo
treatment remain to be comprehensively analyzed, our
results and reports by others, indicate that CpdA induces
fewer adverse effects both in control animals and in animal
models of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis,
and Duchene muscle dystrophy when compared to Gcs
[67, 73, 104, 105]. Indeed, in contrast to Gcs, CpdA did
not induce key liver gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6phosphatase and PEPCK, did not affect hepatic glycogen
formation and, as a result did not induce hyperglycemia
and hyperinsulinemia after systemic chronic animal
treatment [64, 106]. It is important to note that although
decreased β-cell insulin production and insulin resistance
induced by Gcs may lead to the induction of type II
diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing diabetes in patients
[47], CpdA did not impair glucose metabolism, suggesting
a reduced risk for induced type II diabetes by this GR
ligand. Furthermore, CpdA was effective in the prevention
and treatment of experimental inflammatory diabetes,
which resembles type I diabetes in patients [73].
In contrast to steroids, CpdA did not induce muscle
waste when it was used systemically in mdx mice [67].
CpdA also did not induce skin atrophy in rats and mice
when applied topically [107, 108], which we have
correlated with its inability to induce atrophogene REDD1
in skin (Budunova, Haegeman, unpublished). In addition,
the inhibitory effect of CpdA on collagen type I and III
gene expression in skin, the key molecular change related
to atrophy in dermis, was favorably diminished when
compared to Gcs [107, 108].
Chronic administration of Gcs also leads to bone
loss and osteoporosis due to reduced bone turnover,
induction of osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, negative
effects on Collagen 1 and Runx2, genes directly involved
in bone formation, as well as activation of osteoclasts via

Cell desensitization to activated GR signaling:
CpdA versus glucocorticoids
Chronic treatment with Gcs frequently result in the
development of resistance to steroids (tachyphylaxis) [93],
which is in part mediated by the decreased GR levels in the
cells. It is known that GR agonists induce the repression
of GR transcription as well as the destabilization of the
GR at mRNA and protein levels [94]. The inhibition of
GR transcription by Gcs is mediated by the recruitment
of activated GR to the negative GRE in exon 6 of GR,
followed by the assembly of a GR-NCoR1-HDAC3
repression complex at the transcriptional start site of the GR
gene [94]. Interestingly, CpdA did not induce GR loading
in exon 6 (Haegeman and Cidlowski, unpublished data).
Although Gcs also induce GR degradation by
proteasome [87], CpdA, in contrast, did not trigger
significant GR degradation in lymphoid cells or in
synoviocytes [38, 39, 70]. The differential effects of CpdA
on crucial steps in GR degradation by the proteasome,
such as GR phosphorylation and ubiquitination for
example, remain to be investigated.
Another mechanism of cell desensitization common
to Gcs is mediated by a negative feedback loop via the GR
molecular chaperone FKBP51, also referred to as FK506binding protein 5 [95]. FKBP51 sequesters the GR in the
cytoplasm and prevents nuclear translocation [96, 97].
We showed that, in contrast to Gcs, CpdA did not activate
FKBP51 gene expression [39, 83].
In summary, our experiments demonstrated that
CpdA failed to induce major mechanisms underlying the
development of cell resistance to activated GR signaling.

Adverse metabolic and atrophogenic effects:
CpdA versus glucocorticoids
Together with their excellent therapeutic effects,
Gcs are notorious for their multiple adverse side effects
which develop in different organs and tissues during
chronic treatment. The long list of undesirable effects
includes changes in glucose and fat metabolism, Cushing’s

activation of RANKL and osteopontin genes [12, 67]. The
negative effects of CpdA on the bone metabolism were
significantly weaker compared to Gcs in both newborn and
adult mice [67, 104, 105].
Exogenous Gcs suppress the hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, a major component of the
neuroendocrine system, which controls stress adaptation
and many body functions, including the immune response,
mood and emotions, energy storage, while also regulating
the biosynthesis of corticosteroids via ACTH in the
adrenals [12]. ACTH is the key regulatory hormone in
the HPA feedback loop, and its expression is negatively
regulated by Gcs [12]. It is interestingly to note that even
though GR TR by CpdA is overall very efficient, CpdA
did not affect the HPA axis significantly as was assessed
by the lack of changes in corticosterone and ACTH serum
levels [63, 64].
It is however, important to state that CpdA has some
limitations possibly due to its restricted chemical stability.
CpdA has a relatively narrow therapeutic window and
when used at high doses (~15 mg/kg) for longer periods
it may gradually induce apoptosis via GR-independent
metabolites [8, 64]. Although the anti-cancer effect of
CpdA in the lymphoma xenograft model was achieved
at lower doses (Fig. 3C), without inducing significant
adverse effects during 4–6 wk animal treatment, the
treatment of inflammatory diseases in animal models are
reported to require higher doses of CpdA [62, 63, 65, 66].
Thus, in our ongoing work we have initiated
synthesis of more stable SEGRA using CpdA as a
prototype. To date, we and others have used a racemic
Compound A for all in vitro and in vivo studies, even
though it is known that enantiomers of chiral molecules
including steroid receptor ligands often exhibit different
chemical and biological properties [109, 110]. Thus,
alternative approaches to improve CpdA ligand binding
and pharmacological properties could involve its synthesis
as an enantiopure compound.

in vivo − preventing GR dimerization and subsequent
TA, while switching GR activity towards TR. We also
showed that CpdA is a dual GR/AR ligand and can act as
an anti-inflammatory anti-androgen. The very beneficial
pharmacological profile of CpdA can be attributed to its
properties as a GR ligand retaining the therapeutic antiinflammatory and anti-cancer potential of Gcs, while
inducing fewer side effects. CpdA is furthermore less
likely to induce patient resistance as it does not activate the
major mechanisms of cell desensitization typical for Gcs.
Overall, these properties make CpdA and its prospective
derivatives very attractive candidates for clinical
applications in the treatment of various inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma
and type I diabetes, neuropathy, muscle dystrophies as
well as cancer, especially in combinational chemotherapy.

In this review, we summarized the results of
10 years of research collaboration between several
academic organizations: Stellenbosch University
(S. Africa), University of Ghent (Belgium), Northwestern
University (Chicago, USA) and the Blokhin Cancer Center
(Moscow, Russia), that led not only to the identification of
CpdA as a unique SEGRA but also to the characterization
of its ligand properties as well as its anti-inflammatory
and anti-cancer activities. These studies unraveled the
unusual biological properties of CpdA, but also provided
a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
therapeutic and adverse effects of Gcs. To date no other
SEGRA has been shown to exhibit the distinct profile of
a dissociating GR ligand as has CpdA both in vitro and
