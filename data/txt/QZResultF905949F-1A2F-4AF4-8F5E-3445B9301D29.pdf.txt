Casein kinase 1 delta and epsilon (CK1d/e) are key
regulators of diverse cellular growth and survival processes including Wnt signaling, DNA repair and circadian
rhythms. Recent studies suggest that they have an
important role in oncogenesis. RNA interference screens
identiﬁed CK1e as a pro-survival factor in cancer cells
in vitro and the CK1d/e-speciﬁc inhibitor IC261 is
remarkably effective at selective, synthetic lethal killing
of cancer cells. The recent development of the nanomolar
CK1d/e-selective inhibitor, PF670462 (PF670) and the
CK1e-selective inhibitor PF4800567 (PF480) offers an
opportunity to further test the role of CK1d/e in cancer.
Unexpectedly, and unlike IC261, PF670 and PF480 were
unable to induce cancer cell death. PF670 is a potent
inhibitor of CK1d/e in cells; nanomolar concentrations are
sufﬁcient to inhibit CK1d/e activity as measured by
repression of intramolecular autophosphorylation, phosphorylation of disheveled2 proteins and Wnt/b-catenin
signaling. Likewise, small interfering RNA knockdown of
CK1d and CK1e reduced Wnt/b-catenin signaling without
affecting cell viability, further suggesting that CK1d/e
inhibition may not be relevant to the IC261-induced cell
death. Thus, while PF670 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt
signaling, it only modestly inhibits cell proliferation. In
contrast, while sub-micromolar concentrations of IC261
neither inhibited CK1d/e kinase activity nor blocked
Wnt/b-catenin signaling in cancer cells, it caused a rapid
induction of prometaphase arrest and subsequent apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. In a stepwise transformation model, IC261-induced killing required both overactive
Ras and inactive p53. IC261 binds to tubulin with an
afﬁnity similar to colchicine and is a potent inhibitor of
microtubule polymerization. This activity accounts for
many of the diverse biological effects of IC261 and, most
importantly, for its selective cancer cell killing.

Introduction
Casein kinase 1 (CK1) is a family of ubiquitous serine/
threonine-speciﬁc protein kinases that regulates diverse
cellular processes, including Wnt signaling, circadian
rhythms, cellular signaling, membrane trafﬁcking, cytoskeleton maintenance, DNA replication, DNA damage and RNA metabolism (Vielhaber and Virshup,
2001; Knippschild et al., 2005; Price, 2006; Virshup
et al., 2007). Small-molecule inhibitors that were
developed to antagonize CK1 kinase activity have been
valuable tools in dissecting the role of CK1 in these
processes. However, one caveat with all small-molecule
inhibitors (and indeed, with most perturbants) is that
they may often antagonize the function of more than
one cellular target (Hampton, 2004).
Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway has been
implicated in a variety of human cancers. Targeting key
mediators of the Wnt signaling pathway such as CK1d/e
may inhibit tumor progression. Notably, several recent
studies have highlighted the role of CK1d and CK1e in
cell survival and cancer progression. Kinome RNA
interference (RNAi) screens showed that knockdown
of CK1e slowed cancer cell growth (Grueneberg
et al., 2008; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). CK1d, a close
homolog of CK1e, has also been implicated in
pancreatic cancer progression (Brockschmidt et al.,
2008). In a number of these studies, data obtained from
the RNAi knockdown of CK1d/e were corroborated
with the use of a CK1d/e-speciﬁc inhibitor, IC261
(Brockschmidt et al., 2008; Yang and Stockwell, 2008).
IC261 is a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK1d
and CK1e with less effect on CK1a (Behrend et al.,
2000; Mashhoon et al., 2000). in vitro with puriﬁed
protein it has a reported half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) in the range of 1–25 mM (Behrend
et al., 2000; Bain et al., 2007), but inhibition of CK1 in
cultured cells most likely requires concentrations at the
high end of this range. In a number of studies, cultured
cells were treated with IC261 at concentrations of
25–100 mM. For instance, we demonstrated that 100 mM

IC261 partially blocked the CK1d/e-dependent degradation of the circadian regulator Per2 (Eide et al., 2005), a
ﬁnding consistent with genetic studies (Kloss et al., 1998;
Price et al., 1998; Toh et al., 2001; Meng et al., 2008).
Furthermore, inhibition of CK1d/e with 40 mM IC261
negatively modulates Wnt signaling by strengthening the
interactions of proteins in the b-catenin destruction
complex with both axin and b-catenin (Gao et al., 2002).
However, IC261 has also been reported to induce
cellular phenotypes at much lower doses. It has been
reported that 0.4–1 mM IC261 causes cell cycle arrest,
mitotic spindle defects and apoptosis, with the degree of
cell killing dependent on p53 status (Behrend et al.,
2000; Stöter et al., 2005). While these data appeared to
be consistent with a key role for CK1 in chromosome
segregation, subsequent CK1d/e-speciﬁc RNAi knockdown studies have not produced such dramatic effects
on the cell cycle and cell survival (Brockschmidt et al.,
2008; Yang and Stockwell, 2008).
Recently, new small-molecules that inhibit CK1d/e
activity with greater potency have been reported
(Badura et al., 2007; Walton et al., 2009). One of these
compounds, PF670462 (herein referred to as PF670),
with an IC50 of 80–130 nM in vitro, was shown to alter
CK1d/e-dependent processes in circadian rhythms in
both cultured cells and in animals (Badura et al., 2007;
Bryant et al., 2009; Sprouse et al., 2009). A second
compound, PF4800567 (herein referred to as PF480) is
selective for CK1e, with an IC50 of 32 nM for CK1e and
711 nM for CK1d (Walton et al., 2009). In the present
study, we compared the efﬁcacy of PF670, PF480 and
IC261 on the repression of CK1d/e-dependent Wnt/bcatenin signaling and inhibition of cancer cell growth.
Consistent with its IC50, the dual kinase inhibitor PF670
is three orders of magnitude more potent than IC261 at
inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Notably, at submicromolar concentrations that effectively induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis, IC261 failed to inhibit in vivo
CK1d/e kinase activity. Instead, we ﬁnd that IC261
blocks mitotic progression by direct inhibition of
microtubule polymerization. Conversely, PF670 inhibited cellular CK1d/e but did not induce cell cycle arrest
or apoptosis. Our ﬁndings have ramiﬁcations for studies
employing sub-micromolar concentrations of IC261 as
CK1d/e inhibitors and highlight its potential as a cancer
selective drug that acts through inhibition of microtubule polymerization.

Results
IC261 selectively suppresses human cancer cell growth
As CK1d/e activity has been reported to be essential for
survival of cancer cell lines, including some that are
dependent on b-catenin signaling (Grueneberg et al.,
2008; Yang and Stockwell, 2008; Kim et al., 2010), we
treated a panel of cancer cells with IC261 to assess its
spectrum of activity. Consistent with previous reports,
100 nM IC261 caused a near-total growth arrest of most
of the cell lines that we screened (Figure 1a). In the two

lines analyzed in more detail, the acute growth inhibition of HEK293 and HT1080 cells was characterized by
caspase 3-dependent apoptosis (Figure 1b).
Several studies indicated that IC261 might selectively
kill transformed cells (Behrend et al., 2000; Yang and
Stockwell, 2008; Kim et al., 2010). To conﬁrm and
extend this ﬁnding, we utilized a series of human
mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) either immortalized
with hTert, partially transformed with hTert, small t
antigen, and H-RasV12-ER, or fully transformed by the
further addition of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against
p53 (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003; Rangarajan et al.,
2004). We exposed these HMEC-derived cells to
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)- or IC261-supplemented
culture media with 0.13 mM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT; to activate H-RasV12-ER) for 72 h. IC261 selectively suppressed the growth of fully transformed
HMEC-derived cells, but not their non-transformed
counterparts, at sub-micromolar concentrations (Figure 1c).
The IC261-induced growth arrest of HMEC-derived
cells appeared to require concurrent activation of
the Ras signaling pathway and deregulation of the
p53 pathway, as these cells remained viable in IC261supplemented culture media without 4-OHT (Figure 1c).
We observed similar results with a series of BJderived ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Figure S1). Taken
together, our data conﬁrm and extend prior reports
that IC261 potently and selectively inhibits cancer cell
growth.
PF670 is a weak inhibitor of proliferation
IC261 is widely used as a selective inhibitor of CK1d/e,
albeit at micromolar concentrations, and the preceding
data are consistent with the model that inhibition of
CK1d and/or CK1e causes cancer cell death. It would be
desirable to have additional small-molecule inhibitors
of CK1d/e with higher afﬁnities to further test this
hypothesis. PF670, a recently developed CK1d/e inhibitor, inhibits CK1d/e at nanomolar concentrations
in vitro. In addition, the compound is bioavailable, as it
can induce a phase delay in circadian rhythms in cells,
tissues, mice and monkeys (Badura et al., 2007; Sprouse
et al., 2009). If inhibition of CK1d/e and Wnt/b-catenin
is indeed responsible for the cytotoxic effects of IC261,
PF670 should be an even better anti-cancer agent as it
inhibits CK1d/e at concentrations that are three orders
of magnitude lower.
We therefore, tested PF670 on two representative cell
lines that are sensitive to IC261. Unexpectedly, we
found that 1 mM PF670 only modestly reduced the
growth of HEK293 and HT1080 cells (Figures 2a, b and
c). Furthermore, PF670 failed to induce either an acute
cell cycle arrest at G2/M (in HEK293 cells) or a sub-G1
population indicative of apoptosis (HT1080 cells), as
was observed within 24 h of exposure to IC261
(Figure 2a). In the same assays, 1 mM IC261 completely
inhibited the growth of these cells, as demonstrated by
both colony-forming (Figure 2a) and viable cell count
(Figures 2b and c) analyses. These data suggest that
either PF670 did not inhibit CK1d/e and subsequently

b-catenin activity in these cell lines, or that CK1d/e and
Wnt/b-catenin inhibition is irrelevant for the cytotoxic
effects exhibited by IC261.
PF670 is a more potent inhibitor than IC261 of CK1d/e
activity
To examine the ﬁrst possibility, we tested the effects of
PF670 on CK1d/e activity and the Wnt/b-catenin
pathway. CK1d/e is required for high-level Wnt/bcatenin signaling (Peters et al., 1999; Sakanaka et al.,
1999; Bryja et al., 2007). Using HEK293 cells expressing
Wnt3A and containing an integrated luciferase gene
driven by b-catenin responsive promoter (HEK293STF3A)
as a Wnt/b-catenin reporter assay, the activities of
Oncogene

IC261 and PF670 were compared. As shown in
Figure 2e, PF670 inhibited Wnt/b-catenin signaling
with an IC50 of B17 nM, while IC261 had an IC50 of
B36 mM, consistent with previously reported values for
CK1 inhibition (Gao et al., 2002; Bain et al., 2007).
Notably, PF670 gave near maximal inhibition of
b-catenin activity at 1 mM (Figure 2e), but had only a
small effect on proliferation at this concentration
(Figures 2a, b and c), whereas IC261 did not signiﬁcantly repress Wnt/b-catenin signaling at this concentration but had strong growth inhibitory activity toward
HEK293 cells.
Thus far, our data suggest that PF670 represses Wnt/bcatenin signaling by inhibition of CK1d/e, while IC261
at 1 mM induces cancer cytotoxicity without inhibiting

Figure 2 PF670462 and IC261 have divergent effects on Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cellular growth. PF670462 is a weak inhibitor of
transformed cell proliferation. HEK293 and HT1080 cells were seeded at 5% conﬂuence in 6-well plates and treated with either DMSO
(0.001%), PF670462 (1 mM) or IC261 (1 mM) over 7 days and assessed by (a) 0.5% crystal violet staining and (b, c) viable cell counts.
(d) IC261, but not PF670462, causes cell cycle arrest. HEK293 and HT1080 cells were seeded at 80% conﬂuence in 6-well plates and
treated with DMSO (0.001%), PF670462 (1 mM) or IC261 (1 mM) for 24 h before DNA content analyses by ﬂow cytometry.
(e) PF670462 is a potent inhibitor of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. HEKSTF3A cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of
PF670462 or IC261 for 16 h. DMSO (0.001%) was used as the vehicle control. Reporter activity was measured as relative light units
(RLU) and normalized to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. PF670462 and IC261 dose–response curves were ﬁtted using a
non-linear regression model in GraphPad Prism 5.0c.

b-catenin activity. However, as transactivation of a
b-catenin responsive promoter is an indirect measure of
CK1d/e activity, we investigated whether phosphorylation of CK1d/e targets in vivo could also be inhibited
by these drugs at 1 mM. To directly test CK1d/e activity
we made use of the fact that the kinase autophosphorylates its carboxyl-terminus regulatory domain in
an intramolecular reaction (Cegielska et al., 1998). This
reaction is continuously reversed by cellular protein
phosphatases that are sensitive to okadaic acid and
calyculin A (Cegielska et al., 1998; Rivers et al., 1998),
and addition of 50 nM calyculin A consequently results in
a rapid and distinct electrophoretic mobility shift of
endogenous CK1d and CK1e due to unopposed phosphorylation. PF670 inhibited in vivo CK1e and CK1d
carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation completely at

1 mM (Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S2). Notably,
strong inhibition of in vivo CK1d/e autophosphorylation
in this short-term assay was achieved with as low as
100 nM PF670, consistent with its effect on Wnt/b-catenin
signaling (data not shown). In contrast, 1 mM IC261 did
not result in detectable inhibition of autophosphorylation
by CK1, consistent with its failure to inhibit b-catenin
activity at this concentration (Figure 2e). Although 1 mM
IC261 can be cytotoxic to these cells, in the short time
frame of this experiment (up to 60 min) no detrimental
effect on cell viability or protein abundance was seen.
The inhibition of autophosphorylation by PF670
indicates the compound regulates intracellular CK1
activity. To examine the effect of the compounds on
CK1 activity towards known Wnt pathway substrates,

Dvl2 phosphorylation. Nanomolar concentrations of
PF670 inhibited the electrophoretic mobility shift of
Dvl2, while 410 mM IC261 was required to achieve
the same effect (Figure 3b). In addition, we examined
the differential activity of the CK1 inhibitors on the
expression of Axin2, an endogenous target of Wnt/bcatenin signaling. Consistent with their effect on CK1
autophosphorylation and Dvl2 phosphorylation, after a
6-h incubation, nanomolar concentrations of PF670 but
micromolar concentrations of IC261 were able to inhibit
the expression of Axin2 (Figure 3c). Collectively, our
ﬁndings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of
CK1d/e, while capable of inhibiting Wnt/b-catenin
signaling, does not block cell cycle progression or induce
cell death.

Figure 3 IC261 and PF670462 have divergent effects in cells.
(a) Cytotoxic concentrations of IC261 do not inhibit CK1d/e in
cells. CK1e intramolecular autophosphorylation in intact cells was
unmasked as previously described (Rivers et al., 1998) (Materials
and methods) by the addition of 50 nM calyculin A in the absence
or presence of the indicated concentrations of PF670462 or IC261.
PP2A A subunit served as the loading control. PS denotes
phosphorylated and shifted. The residual mobility shift of CK1e
in the presence of PF670462 is probably due to its phosphorylation
by other cellular kinases (Clokie et al., 2009). The decreased
immunoreactivity of the autophosphorylated CK1e is due to
phosphorylation-mediated masking of the Mab epitope. (b)
PF670462, but not cytotoxic concentrations of IC261, inhibits
Dvl2 phosphorylation. HEK293STF3A cells were treated with vehicle
or the indicated concentration of PF670462 or IC261 for 30 min.
Cells were then lysed and the Dvl2 mobility shift was assessed by
SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting. (c) Dose-dependent inhibition
of a b-catenin target gene by PF670462 and IC261. HEK293STF3A
cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of compound
for 6 h, followed by lysis and qPCR quantiﬁcation of Axin2
mRNA. Data are representative of three independent sets of
experiment each performed in triplicate. A Student’s t-test was

(Dvl) was examined. CK1e phosphorylates Dvl proteins
on multiple sites in response to Wnt signaling, inducing
an electrophoretic mobility shift (Peters et al., 1999;
Kishida et al., 2001). We exposed HEK293STF3A cells to
PF670 or IC261 for 30 min and determined the effect on
Oncogene

Knockdown of CK1d/e phenocopies PF670 and not IC261
To test inhibition of CK1d/e activity via an independent
approach, we performed RNAi knockdown of both
CK1d and CK1e levels in the HEK293STF3A cells
(Figure 4a). Consistent with previous reports, we
observed signiﬁcant repression of Wnt/b-catenin signaling upon reduction of CK1d and CK1e abundance
(Figure 4b). However, the combined partial knockdown
of CK1d and CK1e levels with small interfering RNA
(siRNA) failed to induce cell cycle arrest and/or cell
death (Figure 4c). Knockdown of CK1d/e gave similar
results to those seen with treatment with 1 mM PF670,
and distinct from those seen with 1 mM IC261.
Several RNA interference studies have demonstrated
that a number of shRNAs directed against CK1e but
not CK1d can slow cancer cell growth, while both IC261
and PF670 inhibit both CKId and CK1e. To investigate
whether isolated CK1e inhibition could be more toxic
than combined CK1d/e inhibition, we tested a different,
CK1e-selective inhibitor, PF4800567 (PF480), that
relatively spares CK1d activity (Walton et al., 2009)
(Figure 5). We conﬁrmed that PF480 selectively inhibited CK1e using the in vivo autophosphorylation assay
(Figure 5a). PF480 was less effective than PF670 at
inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Figure 5b).
These data suggest that CK1d and CK1e have additive
roles in promoting Wnt/b-catenin signaling. The CK1eselective PF480 displayed no anti-proliferative effects at
concentrations that completely inhibited CK1e activity
(Figures 5c and d). We conclude that combined inhibition of CK1d and CK1e is required for maximal
inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and cell proliferation (Figures 2b, c and e), and that effective isolated
pharmacologic inhibition of CK1e does not signiﬁcantly
alter the proliferation of cells that are sensitive to
IC261.
PF670 and IC261 have divergent effects on gene
expression
To assess whether PF670 and IC261 share a common
mechanism of cancer cytotoxicity, we studied their effect
on gene expression at near lethal doses. In the gastric
cancer cell line AGS, the GI50 of IC261 was found to be
340 nM, while PF670 failed to inhibit growth of AGS

cells even at 10 mM (data not shown). Cells were treated
with DMSO (o0.1%), 10 mM PF670 or 340 nM IC261
for 6 h, respectively, before gene expression proﬁling.
We analyzed the gene signature proﬁles by signiﬁcance
analysis of microarrays (with false discovery rate
(FDR)p0.01%) and observed that only ﬁve genes were
in common among the 186 and 86 genes differentially
regulated by PF670 and IC261, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S1).
Consistent with our quantitative PCR data (Figure 3c),
the Wnt signaling-related genes Fzd6 and Axin2 were
signiﬁcantly downregulated by PF670 but not IC261
(Supplementary Table S1). Taken together, gene expression analysis supports the conclusion that PF670
and IC261 regulate distinctive intracellular pathways.

IC261. (a–c) RNAi knockdown of CK1d/e blocks Wnt/b-catenin
signaling but has no effect on cell cycle progression. (a) RNAimediated knockdown of CK1d/e in HEK293STF3A cells. Two

was performed; *P-value o0.001; **P-value o0.005 for the
comparison of siCK1d þ e- and PF670462-treated samples with
their respective controls. (c) CK1d/e knockdown has no signiﬁcant
effect on cell cycle progression in HEK293 cells. Similar results
were seen in three independent experiments.

IC261 is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization
The data indicate that IC261 induces both mitotic
arrest and cytotoxicity independent of its inhibition of
CK1d/e. Thus, there should be another widely expressed
protein to which IC261 binds at nanomolar, rather than
micromolar concentrations. To determine other potential cancer-associated cellular targets of IC261, we more
closely examined the IC261 G2/M arrest phenotype.
Time-lapse video microscopy was performed using
asynchronous histone 2B-GFP-expressing HeLa cells.
DMSO- or PF670 (1 mM)-treated HeLa cell progress
normally through mitosis and give rise to a pair of
daughter cells (Supplementary Video S1 and S2).
However, 1 mM IC261 induced a prometaphase arrest
of HeLa cells followed by apoptosis (Supplementary
Video S3).
Prometaphase arrest is triggered by the spindle
assembly checkpoint and can be caused by a number
of compounds that block proper assembly and
attachment of mitotic microtubules to kinetochores
(Weaver and Cleveland, 2005). Different drugs produce
distinctive effects on mitotic spindle formation that can
readily be assessed. The effect of IC261 was therefore
compared with other compounds that block the cell
cycle at prometaphase, including inhibitors of Polo-like
kinase 1 and the mitotic kinesin EG5, as well as the
microtubule polymerization inhibitors nocodazole
and colchicine, and the microtubule stabilizer taxol.
As Figure 6a illustrates, 1 mM IC261 phenocopied the
effect of nocodazole and colchicine, and blocked
formation of mitotic spindles in the presence of
condensed chromosomes.
To test directly whether IC261 is a bona ﬁde
microtubule polymerization inhibitor, the effect of IC261
on microtubule assembly was determined in vitro. IC261
directly inhibited the polymerization of puriﬁed porcine
brain tubulin with equimolar potency to the microtubule
binding agents, colchicine and nocodazole, while PF670
had no effect on microtubule formation (Figure 6b).
There are two well-characterized sites on tubulin that
destabilize polymerization, the vinca site and the
colchicine site (reviewed in Gigant et al., 2009). We
ﬁnd that IC261 competes with [3H]colchicine for binding
to tubulin (Figure 6c). Taken together, while the

PF4800567, does not inhibit cancer cell growth. The effect of IC261 and PF4800567 on HEK293 and HT1080 cell proliferation was

biological effects of PF670 appear to be explained
by inhibition of CK1d/e, the cytotoxicity of IC261 is
a direct consequence of its ability to bind to the
colchicine site on tubulin and thereby inhibit microtubule polymerization.

Discussion
Genetic ablation and pharmacological intervention
represent two complementary approaches that are
widely used to dissect the role(s) of druggable cellular
targets such as protein kinases in tumorigenesis. The
ability to cross-validate RNA knockdown and drug
studies can provide valuable conﬁrmation of appropriate targets and may help exclude off target effects.
A number of recent studies have found that shRNAs
that knockdown CK1e slowed cancer cell growth.

Additionally, these and other studies found that the
CK1d/e-selective inhibitor IC261 is a potent transformation-selective anti-cancer agent. Here, we independently validated the potency of IC261 as an anti-cancer
drug and conﬁrmed that it induces cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in a wide range of transformed cells at
nanomolar concentration. We ﬁnd that IC261 acts by
a CK1d/e- and Wnt/b-catenin-independent induction of
the spindle assembly checkpoint. This prometaphase
arrest initially suggested IC261 might be inhibiting a
mitotic kinase. However, in prior surveys, IC261 did not
inhibit a number of mitotic kinases, including Polo-like
kinase 1, Aurora B and C, and Chk1 and Chk2 (Bain
et al., 2007; Fedorov et al., 2007). Instead, our data
indicate that IC261 inhibits microtubule polymerization
at doses far below those needed to inhibit CK1, a ﬁnding
consistent with induction of prometaphase arrest. The
effect is due to direct binding of IC261 to the colchicinebinding site on b-tubulin (Figure 6c). Intriguingly,

HT1080 cells were grown to 50% conﬂuence and treated with DMSO (0.02%), taxol, BI 2536, monastrol, nocodazole, colchicine,
IC261 or PF670462 at the indicated concentrations for 18 h. Cells were then ﬁxed, permeabilized and immunostained with a-tubulin
antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody. Cellular DNA was counterstained with DAPI-VectorShield
and visualized by a Carl Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope with a  63 oil immersion lens. Images are representatives
of three independent experiments. (b) IC261 inhibits in vitro tubulin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner. Tubulin (499%
pure) was exposed to DMSO (0.1%), taxol, nocodazole, colchicine, IC261 and PF670462 at the indicated concentrations in a black
multi-well plate and incubated at 37 1C. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at a 1-min interval for 1 h (excitation wavelength (Ex):
350 nm; emission wavelength (Em): 430 nm). (c) IC261 binds to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin. Tubulin (499% pure) was
incubated with 100 nM [3H]colchicine and the indicated concentrations of competitor colchicine or IC261 at 37 1C for 1 h. The amount
of [3H]colchicine bound to tubulin was determined by a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Assays were performed in triplicate and
repeated.

several other trimethoxy phenolic compounds that are
chemically similar to IC261 have been reported to be
microtubule polymerization inhibitors with potent antiproliferative and anti-tumor activity (Kuo et al., 2004;
Arora et al., 2009). This suggests that the trimethoxy
phenol moiety of these anti-mitotic compounds is
critical for their shared microtubule depolymerization
property.
IC261 selectively suppressed growth of both transformed ﬁbroblasts and HMEC-derived cells, but not
their non-transformed counterparts, consistent with
reports indicating that IC261 may be transformation

selective (Behrend et al., 2000; Yang and Stockwell,
2008). This highlights the selective sensitivity of transformed over non-transformed cells to microtubule
poisons that trigger spindle assembly checkpoints. We
conﬁrmed that activation of RAS combined with
inactivation of p53 was required to fully sensitize cells
to killing by IC261. This effect was seen in both
ﬁbroblasts and HMEC. The mechanism underlying this
sensitization is not well understood. Spindle poisons can
lead to damaged DNA, an effect that may be more
pronounced in transformed than in non-transformed
cells (Dalton et al., 2007). Similarly, RAS and p53
Oncogene

2566

mutations can cooperate to cause chromosome breaks
(Agapova et al., 1999). Microtubule poison-induced
DNA damage has been postulated to lead to caspase
activation (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008). One speculative model is therefore, that chromosome damage occurs
in response to prolonged exposure to IC261 and other
microtubule poisons and RAS activation and p53 loss
potentiates this damage. Excessive damage may lead to
caspase activation and cell death. Further studies will be
required to fully understand this synthetic lethality.
The anti-cancer activity of IC261 is largely independent of its described inhibitory effects on CK1d/e
activity. We conﬁrmed the new compound PF670
as a potent inhibitor of CK1d/e activity and CK1d/edependent processes in vivo, including Wnt/b-catenin
signaling. At concentrations that effectively inhibit
in vivo CK1d/e kinase activity, PF670 did not cause
cytotoxicity or cell cycle arrest. In contrast, at concentrations that effectively killed human transformed/
cancer cells, IC261 did not inhibit CK1d/e. Consistent with this data, Kim et al. (2010) recently demonstrated that PF670 preferentially inhibits proliferation
of b-catenin-positive MCF7 cells as compared to
b-catenin-negative MDA-MB-453 cells, albeit 12-fold
less effectively than IC261. Taken together, we conclude
that effective inhibition of CK1d/e by PF670 or RNAi
impairs Wnt/b-catenin signaling and Dvl phosphorylation but does not lead to signiﬁcant cell cycle arrest or
cytotoxicity.
Why do multiple shRNA screens ﬁnd an antiproliferative effect of CK1e knockdown, while we see
different results with siRNA and perhaps with PF480
and PF670? Knockdown by shRNA can be more
durable than knockdown by siRNA, and more effective
knockdown or inhibition of CK1d/e does in fact impair
cell growth, albeit via a different mechanism than
IC261. The shRNA-mediated growth inhibition reported by others is similar to the B50% maximal
growth inhibition we see in cells treated with PF670
(Figures 2b and c), and supports a positive but not
essential role for CK1d/e in proliferation, perhaps via
their function in the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Interestingly, we did not see signiﬁcant growth inhibition by the
CK1e-selective agent, PF480. This suggests either the
growth effect is via inhibition of CK1d, or redundancy
of CK1e with CK1d, but fails to explain why shRNA
against CK1e was so effective in slowing cell growth in
other reports. We note that CK1e could also have
non-catalytic functions in cell proliferation, as a
structural role in circadian rhythms has been reported
for the Drosophila ortholog double-time (Yu et al.,
2009). A scaffolding role for CK1e might account for
some of the differences between the shRNA and PF480
drug studies.
PF670, more so than PF480, was effective at
inhibiting Wnt/b-catenin signaling, and this could
contribute to its ability to slow cancer cell proliferation.
Notably, PF670 only produced sub-maximal inhibition
of b-catenin signaling even at levels that fully inhibit
CK1d/e. This is likely to be attributable to a basal level
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling that does not require CK1d/e
Oncogene

activity, as has been previously reported (Bryja et al.,
2007). A number of cell lines have aberrant activation of
b-catenin due to diverse mechanisms including autocrine
Wnt loops, mutation of APC and mutation of b-catenin.
CK1d/e can act both at the level of the disheveled/axin
complex and downstream as well at the level of the
translational co-repressor Tcf3 (Lee et al., 2001).
Pharmacologic inhibition of CK1d/e can therefore
diminish b-catenin signaling via several routes. However, the sub-maximal inhibition may only slow, rather
than fully block, proliferation. Inhibition of b-catenin
signaling via targeting of CK1d/e may therefore not
be an effective way to halt proliferation of many cancer
cell lines.
Finally, we conclude that previous studies where the
biological effect of low micromolar concentrations of
IC261 in transformed cells was attributed to CK1
inhibition should be interpreted with caution.

Materials and methods
Plasmid DNA, cell culture and other reagents
The use of pCL-eco, pBabehyg-hTERT, pBabepuro-H-RASV12
ER, pMSCV-st-GFP, pMSCV-Blast and pMSCV-Blastp53KD expression constructs have been previously described
(Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003); KD, knockdown. Other cell
lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). Ecopack-2 and Phoenix-Ampho cells
were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA).
Cell culture conditions and other reagents are described in
Supplementary Information.
Crystal violet staining
Cells were then ﬁxed with methanol for 10 min and stained
with 0.5% crystal violet dye (in methanol:deionized water, 1:5)
for 10 min. Excess crystal violet dye was removed by ﬁve
washes of deionized water on a shaker (10 min for each wash)
and the culture plates were dried overnight. The crystal violet
dye was released from cells by incubation with 1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 6 h before optical density (OD)595 nm
measurement.
Denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and western blot analysis
Cells were lysed by 4% SDS and total protein content was
measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins from whole
cell extracts were resolved using denaturing SDS–PAGE and
analyzed by western blot. Antibodies used in western blot
analyses include anti-cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase
(PARP, ab32561, abcam), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (#9664, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-CK1d
(128A, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA), anti-CK1e (610445,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), anti-Dvl2 (sc-13974,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and antiPP2A A subunit (JH242) (McCright and Virshup, 1995).
AlamarBlue cell viability assay
HMEC-derived cells (5000 cells/well) were plated in 96-well
tissue culture plates (pre-treated with poly-L-lysine) and then
treated with 4-OHT and DMSO (vehicle control) or the
indicated concentrations of IC261 in triplicate for 72 h. Cell

number and viability were assayed after drug treatment by the
reduction of alamarBlue (DAL1025, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), a measure of mitochondrial ﬁtness that provides a
surrogate endpoint for cell number, as previously described
(Nakayama et al., 1997).
Flow cytometric DNA content analysis
HEK293 and HT1080 cells were grown to 50% conﬂuence on
6-well plates 24 h before incubation with DMSO (0.001%),
PF670462 (1 mM) and IC261 (1 mM), respectively for an
additional 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, washed with ice-cold
1  phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and ﬁxed overnight with
70% ethanol/30% 1  PBS. Cells were then washed once in
ice-cold 1  PBS and stained with 50 mg/ml propidium
iodide (P4170, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in 1 
PBS solution that was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A
(R6513, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100
(T8787, Sigma-Aldrich). Flow cytometric DNA content
analysis (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; emission wavelength:
620 nm) was performed using the Beckman Coulter FC500
ﬂow cytometer (Brea, CA, USA).
Super TOPFlash luciferase reporter assay
The Super TOPFlash-Wnt3A (STF3A) reporter cell line and
luciferase and lactate dehydrogenase assays were performed as
described (Coombs et al., 2010). All assays were veriﬁed in
three independent sets of experiment with triplicate.
CK1d/e autophosphorylation assay
HEK293 cells were seeded at 80% conﬂuence in 6-well plates
and treated with DMSO (0.001%), PF670462 (1 mM), IC261
(1 mM) or PF4800567 (1 mM) for 30 min before addition of 50 nM
calyculin A to the culture media.
qPCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from DMSO- or drug-treated
HEK293STF3A cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit
(74106, Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA (2 mg) was reverse
transcribed by the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (170–
