ABSTRACT
Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) insurgence and progression depend on the
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Dickkopf (DKK)-1 is an extracellular inhibitor
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that also has undefined β-catenin-independent actions.
Here we report for the first time that a proportion of DKK-1 locates within the nucleus
of healthy small intestine and colon mucosa, and of CRC cells at specific chromatin
sites of active transcription. Moreover, we show that DKK-1 regulates several cancerrelated genes including the cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1
(ALDH1A1) and Ral-binding protein 1-associated Eps domain-containing 2 (REPS2),
which are involved in detoxification of chemotherapeutic agents. Nuclear DKK-1
expression is lost along CRC progression; however, it remains high in a subset (15%)
of CRC patients (n = 699) and associates with decreased progression-free survival
(PFS) after chemotherapy administration and overall survival (OS) [adjusted HR, 1.65;
95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-2.21; P = 0.002)]. Overexpression of ALDH1A1

decreased OS (P = 0.001 and 0.014) and PFS. In summary, our findings demonstrate
a novel location of DKK-1 within the cell nucleus and support a role of nuclear DKK-1
as a predictive biomarker of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

relation of DKK-1 expression with the clinical outcome
and the benefit to systemic therapy in CRC patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important contributor
to cancer mortality and morbidity [1]. Despite advances in
therapy for CRC patients, approximately 20-45% of those
who undergo curative resection subsequently develop
tumor recurrence or distant metastasis [2]. Adjuvant
chemotherapy has demonstrated survival benefits in
patients with advanced-stage CRC, but the lack of patient
selection leads to unnecessary overtreatment and financial
cost [3]. To facilitate individually tailored treatment for
CRC, predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients
who are at high risk for recurrence and/or poor prognosis.
Abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
due to mutation of APC, CTNNB1/β-catenin or AXIN
genes is the initial event and a driving force of colorectal
tumorigenesis [4]. Dickkopf (DKK)-1 is one of the
four members of a family of secreted extracellular Wnt
inhibitors that block signaling from plasma membrane
Wnt-receptor complexes [5, 6]. Paradoxically, however,
DKK-1 modulates proliferation and survival of cancer
cells in which the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is constitutively
activated by mutations in genes encoding intracellular
pathway components, or independently of β-catenin
transcriptional activity [7, 8]. Overall, available data
indicate the existence of uncharacterized actions of DKK1 that are independent of the inhibition of Wnt signaling
at plasma membrane.
In colon cancer cells, DKK-1 inhibits proliferation
both in vitro and in immunodeficient mice [8] and its
expression is linked to an E-cadherin-dependent adhesive
phenotype [9], supporting a tumor suppressor role for this
protein. Moreover, several studies indicate that DKK-1
expression is downregulated along colorectal adenomacarcinoma transition and at late CRC stages but the clinical
consequences are unknown [8, 10]. By contrast, a recent
study indicates that preoperative serum levels of DKK-1
protein seem to be a predictive marker of tumor invasion
and relapse in stage II-III colon cancer [11]. DKK-1 is
also downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
and papillary thyroid cancer [12, 13]. These potential
protective effects contrast with the overexpression of
DKK-1 in several types of cancer associated with a poor
prognosis [14-20], and make the role of DKK-1 as tumor
suppressor or metastasis promoter a matter of debate [21].
In this study, we aimed to decipher the role of DKK1 in CRC by investigating its expression in cultured human
colon carcinoma cells and in normal small intestine and
colon mucosa and colorectal cancer, and by assessing the

RESULTS
DKK-1 protein partially locates within the cell
nucleus
First, we analyzed the expression of DKK-1 protein
in human intestine mucosa using immunofluorescence
multispectral microscopy of healthy individuals.
Unexpectedly, we found nuclear staining in a high
proportion (62.8%) of differentiated cells (i.e. enterocytes
and mucosecretory goblet cells) located at the epithelium
of colon (Fig. 1A) and small intestine (Fig. 1B) crypts.
In the latter, nuclear DKK-1 expression was also detected
in enteroendocrine cells at the bottom of the crypts, as
revealed by co-expression of chromogranin A (Fig. 1B).
Cytoplasmic staining was diffusely present in small
intestine enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells (Fig. 1B).
By contrast, stem cells at the bottom of the crypts and
proliferating undifferentiated cells in the basal epithelia
contained cytoplasmic DKK-1 but lacked nuclear DKK-1
in both colon and small intestine (Figs. 1A and B).
Next, we studied the expression of DKK-1 in human
colon carcinoma cells both in vitro and in a large cohort
of metastatic CRC patients. DKK-1 was found partially
located within the nucleus of SW480-ADH CRC cells, as
shown by punctate immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2A)
and confirmed and quantified by Western blot analysis of
cellular fractions (Fig. 2B). Nuclear DKK-1 accounted
for 7% of total protein. We also detected nuclear DKK1 via proteomic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
by transfecting DLD-1 CRC cells lacking endogenous
expression with a DKK-1 gene (DLD-1/DKK-1 cells)
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
To identify the precise intranuclear location of
DKK-1, we performed double immunofluorescence
assays. DKK-1 did not colocalize with either fibrillarin
or 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap (TMG-cap), indicating
that it is absent from the nucleolus and nuclear speckles,
respectively (Fig. 2C). Sporadic colocation of DKK1 with acetylated histone H4 indicated its presence in
transcriptionally active chromatin (Fig. 2C), which
was confirmed by in vivo transcription assays based on
the incorporation of 5’-fluorouridine (FU) into nascent
RNA, followed by immunofluorescence using an anti5904

BrdU antibody (Fig. 2C, lowest panels). Moreover,
immunoelectron microscopy analyses using double
immunogold labeling for 5’-FU incorporation sites and
DKK-1 revealed the presence of DKK-1 in euchromatin
but not in transcription-free nuclear domains such
as heterochromatin or nuclear speckles visualized as
interchromatin granule clusters (IGC) (Fig. 2D, above).
Moreover, specific sites of colocation of nascent RNA and
DKK-1 were found (Fig. 2D, below).
We examined whether ectopic DKK-1 could affect
Wnt/β-catenin or non-canonical Wnt signaling in DLD1 cells. DKK-1 did not affect the transcriptional activity
of β-catenin (Supplementary Fig. S3A) or the expression
of two Wnt/β-catenin targets, c-Myc and cyclin D1

(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Likewise, DKK-1 did not
change the levels of total or phosphorylated JNK or of
GSK-3β activity in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and D). Taken together, these results indicate that the
tumor suppressive action of DKK-1 in DLD-1 cells [8]
in which the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is endogenously
activated due to APC mutation is independent of Wnt.

Nuclear DKK-1 in tumor cells associates with
worse progression-free and overall survival in
CRC patients
Next, we examined the expression of DKK-1
protein in adenomas and a cohort of 699 CRC patients

outside but close to nucleoli and nuclear speckles in SW480-ADH cells. By contrast, partial colocation with acetylated Histone H4 and

with clinical follow-up (Supplementary Table S1). As in
healthy individuals, DKK-1 protein was detected both in
the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of normal enterocytes
in adjacent non-tumoral colorectal mucosa; in contrast,
three patterns of expression were found in tumors: absence
of DKK-1, presence of only cytoplasmic DKK-1, and
presence of DKK-1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.
3A). Staining of complete sections of colorectal tumors
showed that the pattern of DKK-1 protein expression
was mostly homogeneous; no differences were found
between tumor areas. The nuclear localization of DKK1 protein was confirmed by using different antibodies
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Data quantification across the
series revealed absence of nuclear DKK-1 in 22% of
adenomas and 75% of carcinomas, and a loss of DKK-1
expression during tumor progression that occurred earlier
in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). Remarkably,
nuclear DKK-1 levels remained high in a subset (n = 103,
14.7%) of CRC. This prompted us to analyze whether
the presence of nuclear DKK-1 within the primary tumor
could affect clinical behavior. Nuclear DKK-1 expression

was associated with decreased Progression-Free Survival
(PFS) after chemotherapy administration (P = 0.001) and
Overall Survival (OS) (P = 0.002) (Fig. 3C). The hazard
ratio for death in patients with nuclear DKK-1 expressing
tumors was 1.65 (IC 95%; 1.23-2.21). This remained true
for patients who received 5’-FU (n = 399, P = 0.011),
FOLFIRI (n = 95, P = 0.012) or FOLFOX (n = 205, P =
0.031) for both OS (Fig. 3D) and PFS (Supplementary Fig.
S5). These findings suggested a role of nuclear DKK-1 in
chemosensitivity and survival in CRC patients.

DKK-1 regulates the expression of the cancerrelated genes ALDH1A1 and REPS2
The location of nuclear DKK-1 in a subset of sites
of active transcription indicates that it participates in the
regulation of specific target genes. To identify DKK-1
targets we used DLD-1/DKK-1 and DLD-1/Mock cells to
perform: a) a comparative global transcriptomic analysis;
and b) chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed

by ultradeep sequencing (ChIP-seq). We obtained 27
differentially expressed probes (Fig. 4A; the complete
list of genes is deposited in the GEO database accession
no. GSE35272). Among candidate target genes identified
in the transcriptomic studies, aldehyde dehydrogenase
1A1 (ALDH1A1), aldo-keto reductase family 1 member
C3 (AKR1C3) and Ral-binding protein 1-associated Eps
domain-containing 2 (REPS2) were particularly interesting
as they have been implicated in the detoxification of
xenobiotics and chemotherapeutic agents [22-25] (Fig.
4B). Moreover, ALDH1A1 has been proposed as a marker
of normal and malignant stem cells in colon and other
tissues, although there is no consensus on its association
with prognosis or patient survival [26-28]. In the ChIPseq, 200 binding sites (average peak width 150) with
significant tag enrichment were identified throughout the
genome (Fig. 4C). Up to 80 individual DKK-1-binding
sites (40%) were associated with genes (GEO accession
no. GSE31170), three of which were coincident with
those found in the transcriptomic study (REPS2, IQGAP2,
LOC554202).

Consistent with their regulation by DKK-1, the RNA
and protein expression of ALDH1A1, AKR1C3 and REPS2
was higher in CRC tumors containing nuclear DKK-1 than
in those that lacked it (Fig. 5A) and it was associated with
the presence of nuclear DKK-1 (Fig. 5B and C). Only two
(0.3%) cases expressed nuclear DKK-1 and none of the
three target genes. Moreover, co-expression of nuclear
DKK-1 and cytoplasmic ALDH1A1 was demonstrated in
the same tumor cells (Fig. 5D).

co-expression of at least one of the three target genes (n
= 101, 14.4%) showed a significant reduction in patient
OS as compared to cases with absence of nuclear DKK-1
and expression of any of the three genes (n = 55, 7.9%)
(P = 0.010). Notably, no effect of DKK-1 on sensitivity
to oxaliplatin, irinotecan or 5’-FU was found in vitro
(DLD-1 and RKO cells), possibly because ectopic DKK-1
expression rendered a level of nuclear DKK-1 protein that
was similar to that of the endogenous protein in SW480ADH cells (7%, Fig. 2) but substantially lower than that

found in tumors (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S6). In
line with this, the expression level of ALDH1A1, REPS2,
and AKR1C3 was lower in DLD-1/DKK-1 cells than in
tumors with nuclear DKK-1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). This
result suggests that extracellular signals, either paracrine
soluble factors or matrix components, may contribute in
vivo, but not in vitro where they are absent, to control the
amount of nuclear DKK-1.

DISCUSSION

the plasma membrane.
The apparent paradoxical behavior of DKK-1 as a
tumor suppressor and an inducer of chemoresistance may
be explained by its distinct roles in the cytoplasm and
nucleus and the non-synchronous loss of its expression in
both cell compartments. The decrease in nuclear DKK1 found at early stages may facilitate tumor progression
based on the results of the ChIP analysis: nuclear DKK-1
regulates genes with antiproliferative action (i.e., NRG1,
NRG3, MAP2K3, PREX2, FAM5B) and involved in
apoptosis (i.e., BCL2A1, DAPK1) (GSE31170), which
may add to the action of extranuclear DKK-1 inhibiting
β-catenin target genes such as c-MYC or CCND1/cyclin
D1. At later stages in human tumors, systemic therapy
can cause the selection of tumor cells with high nuclear
DKK-1 that by inducing genes such as ALDH1A1 and
REPS2 may be responsible for chemoresistance. Thus,
DKK-1 seems to have a dual action in colon cancer, that is
analogous to that of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β
[39, 40], a suppressive action at early stages, by inhibiting
cell proliferation by both Wnt-dependent and -independent
mechanisms, and a tumor promoting action at later stages
of progression, by inducing chemoresistance.
The induction by DKK-1 of ALDH1A1 and REPS2
genes that are involved in cellular detoxification explains
the co-expression of nuclear DKK-1 and these target
genes in tumors of patients with poor outcome after
chemotherapy. Thus, ALDH1A1 and REPS2 (mutated in
14/700, (2%) of colon tumors, and in 4/700, (0.57%) of
colon tumors, respectively; Cosmic database) seem to be
major mediators of nuclear DKK-1 effects. The precise
mechanism by which DKK-1 induces ALDH1A1 remains
to be elucidated. In mouse osteosarcoma cells, Dkk-1
has been recently shown to activate ALDH1 via the noncanonical Jun-mediated Wnt pathway [41], which however
is not affected in our human CRC cells. For REPS2, the
coincidence of transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq analyses
indicates a direct transcriptional regulation by DKK-1.
A number of recent studies propose an important
role of ALDH1A1 in the response to chemotherapy of
patients with colon cancer or other neoplasias. Thus,
colon cancer stem cells secrete high levels of ALDH1A1
that cause extracellular detoxification of maphosphamide
[23] and ALDH1A1 also confers resistance of COLO
205 cells to cyclophosphamide [42]. Consistently,
ALDH1A1 expression in colorectal adenoma is
associated with a higher risk of metachronous adenoma
independent of adenoma size or histopathology [43].
CRC patients with circulating tumor cells expressing
ALDH1, survivin and MRP5 have shorter PFS [44],
and ALDH1A1 rs1342024 polymorphism associates
with shorter time to tumor recurrence [26]. ALDH1A1
is also associated with worse PFS and OS in clear cell
renal cell carcinoma [45] and breast cancer patients
treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy [46]. Moreover,
ALDH1A1 expression associates with chemoresistance of

Our results show for the first time that a proportion
of DKK-1 is located in the nucleus of human enterocytes
and malignant epithelial cells in CRC and regulates the
expression of a number of genes including several that are
relevant for cancer. The location of nuclear DKK-1 in a
subset of sites of active transcription indicates that it is not
an essential component of the chromatin or of the basal
transcriptional machinery but, rather, that it participates in
the transcription of specific target genes.
In recent years, the concept has emerged that proteins
that exert a function in a given subcellular compartment
may play additional roles in different locations [29]. Thus,
cytoskeletal and even plasma membrane proteins have
been found within the cell nucleus, in some cases being
involved in gene transcription [30, 31]. The mechanism
of DKK-1 translocation into the cell nucleus is unknown.
Although the mature DKK-1 protein (37 kDa) does not
have a conventional nuclear localization signal, it has
been proposed that small molecules including proteins of
molecular mass up to 40 kDa may enter the nucleus by
passive diffusion [32] or be imported by interaction with
other proteins that contain a functional nuclear localization
signal [33].
The presence of a fraction of DKK-1 within the
nucleus controlling gene expression might contribute to
explain the recently proposed role of DKK-1 to inhibit
colon cancer-initiating cell growth through mechanisms
other than the blockade of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway [34]. Curiously, the inhibition of cell proliferation
observed in mouse intestinal crypts by forced expression
of exogenous Dkk-1 has been interpreted as the
requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [35]. Likewise,
increased proliferation of colon epithelial cells upon
reduced expression of Dkk-1 has been associated with
increased transcriptional activity of β-catenin [36]. Our
data, however, provide an alternative explanation for
the β-catenin-independent growth inhibitory effects of
DKK-1 in DLD-1 colon carcinoma [8], H28 and MS-1
mesothelioma [7] and HeLa cervical cancer [37] cells.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that colorectal
cancer cells can respond to exogenous and autocrine
Wnt ligands that further activate the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway despite having mutations that stabilize
β-catenin [38]. Therefore, the idea that extracellular
Wnt inhibitors have novel functions based on the
earlier assumption that mutations in APC or β-catenin
would render cells completely independent of canonical
Wnt/β-catenin signaling needs to be re-evaluated. Our
data show that DKK-1 does not affect β-catenin/TCF
transcriptional activity in APC/KRAS mutant DLD-1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) and we propose that nuclear
DKK-1 plays an important functional role in these cells,
as well as in vivo. However, we cannot rule out effects of
extracellular DKK-1 mediated through LRP5/6 binding at

cultured and xenografted ovarian cancer and pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells [47, 48]. Likewise, gastric cancer
cells with high level of ALDH1A1 expression are more
resistant to 5-FU and cis-diamminedichloroplatinium than
those cells with lower level [49].
Our group has previously reported that DKK-1 gene
expression is downregulated in colon cancer as compared
to healthy adjacent tissue [50] and that this is partially due
to promoter methylation of the gene in advanced stages
of progression (Dukes’ C and D) [8]. Those studies were
performed assessing the relative amount of DKK-1 RNA
in healthy vs. tumor tissue. In view of our current work,
it is not only the amount but also the location of DKK1 that matters, so we suggest that future assessments of
DKK-1 status, at least in CRC, must be performed by
immunodetection procedures.
We previously established that the half-life of DKK1 RNA is 2.0 h in SW480-ADH cells [9] and it has been
reported to be 2.3 h in HeLa cells [51] and 2.25 or 1 h
in SW480 cells depending on the culture medium [52].
We are not aware of any study of DKK-1 protein stability
and do not know whether nuclear and extranuclear DKK-1
protein differ in half-life.
In summary, we provide evidence for unpredicted,
Wnt-independent gene regulatory activity of DKK-1
within the nucleus that is associated with chemoresistance
and decreased survival in CRC patients. Our findings may
help to clarify the role of DKK-1 as a tumor suppressor
or metastasis promoter [21]. Discrepancies and conflicting
data present in the literature may depend not only on
the type of cancer but, at least in colorectal neoplasias,
also on the location of DKK-1 protein and the stage of
tumor progression: the presence of DKK-1 within the
cell nucleus seems to be specifically responsible for
drug resistance and so, the analysis of the subcellular
distribution of DKK-1 is warranted. We propose nuclear
DKK-1 as a biomarker for predicting benefit to systemic
therapy in metastatic CRC.

Madrid). For transfection we used the jetPEI reagent
(PolyPlus Transfection). Firefly (Luc) and Renilla
reniformis luciferase (Rluc) activities were measured
separately using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Luc
activity was normalized to Rluc activity. All experiments
were performed at least in triplicate. To study β-catenin
transcriptional activity we used the TOPFlash and
FOPFlash plasmids provided by Dr. H. Clevers (Utrecht,
The Netherlands).

Subcellular fractionation
Whole-cell extracts were obtained in RIPA buffer
as described elsewhere [53], and cytosolic and nuclear
fractions were obtained as reported [54]. Protein
concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein
assay kit.

Patients
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 3 µm tissue
sections from human non-pathological colon (n = 16) and
small intestine (n = 16), colorectal adenomas (n = 76)
and primary tumors from metastatic colorectal (mCRC)
patients (n = 699) were retrieved from Fundación Jiménez
Díaz Biobank. Tumor specimens were retrospectively
selected from consecutive mCRC patients (1998-2009),
which had fulfilled the following criteria: adenocarcinoma,
metastatic disease, no neoadjuvant therapy, available
tissue and clinical follow up. Demographic data are shown
in Supplementary Table S1. Clinical data and follow up
were collected from medical clinical records by medical
oncologists. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the institution (PIC 23/2012).

Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical and
confocal microscopy analyses of human tissues
and cultured cells

METHODS
Cell culture

Staining of human tissues was performed as
described [50] using anti-DKK-1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, #4687; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc14949), anti-ALDH1A1 (R&D Systems, MAB5869, clone
703410), anti-REPS2 (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-80891),
anti-AKR1C3 (Abcam, ab170530), and anti-chromogranin
A (Dako, M0869, clone DAK-A3) antibodies. DKK-1
expression was determined in primary tumors (diagnostic
samples) before chemotherapy administration. Intensity
for nuclear and cytoplasmic DKK-1 was scored by
a computerized measurement using the Nuance FX
Multispectral Imaging System (CRI Caliper Life Sciences)
as described [55] by two researchers (FR and SZ). For

SW480-ADH, DLD-1 and RKO cells were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(both from Invitrogen). Cell lines were originally obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
authenticated using the GenePrint® 10 System (Promega),
which allows co-amplification and three-color detection
of ten human loci: TH01, TPOX, vWA, Amelogenin,
CSF1PO, D16S539, D7S820, D13S317, D21S11 and
D5S818. Short Tandem Repeats profiles were sent for
comparison against cell line datebases (ATCC, DSMZ).

immunofluorescence analyses, cells were rinsed once in
PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT
and rinsed once in 0.1 M glycine and twice in PBS. They
were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and then washed
three times in PBS. The non-specific sites were blocked
by incubation with PBS containing 1% goat serum for
30 min at RT. Next, cells were incubated with a rabbit or
goat polyclonal antibodies against DKK-1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, #4687; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-14949),
mouse monoclonal against V5-epitope (Invitrogen, R96025) and either goat polyclonal antibodies to lamin B (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6216) or mouse monoclonal
antibodies to fibrillarin (Abcam, ab4566, clone 38F3)
or to TMG-cap which recognizes the 5’ cap structure of
spliceosomal snRNAs (Oncogene Research Products,
NA02, clone K121) diluted in PBS for 3 h at RT or
overnight at 4ºC. After four washes in PBS, cells were
incubated with secondary antibodies for 45 min at RT,
washed and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories).
Confocal microscopy was performed with a LSM510
laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with
argon (488 nm), HeNe (543 nm) and HeNe (633 nm) ion
lasers. All confocal scans were acquired with the LSM510
software using a Plan Apochromat 63x NA 1.4 objective
(Carl Zeiss). For double or triple labeling experiments,
images of the same confocal plane were sequentially
recorded and pseudocolor images were generated and
superimposed. TIFF images were further processed using
Photoshop (CS3, Adobe Systems) for presentation.

(HPEM 2x: 60 mM Hepes, 130 mM Pipes, 20 mM EGTA,
and 4 mM MgCl2.6H2O) containing 0.5% Triton X-100
for 10 min. The incorporation of 5’-FU into nascent RNA
was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37ºC with a mouse
monoclonal antibody against halogenated UTP (anti-BrdU,
Sigma, clone BU-33), diluted 1:50 in PBS. The samples
were then washed in 0.01 % Tween 20 in PBS, incubated
for 45 min with anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and mounted with
the anti-fading medium Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).

Immunoelectron microscopy
For double immunogold electron microscopy
detection of nascent RNA and DKK-1, SW480-ADH
cells were cultured in the presence of 5’-FU to a final
concentration of 2 mM for 20 min. Cells were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodilate buffer for 30 min at RT. After fixation, cells
were scrapped off, transferred to an eppendorf tube,
and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in a minifuge.
Cell pellets were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer,
dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol
at -20ºC, embedded in Lowicryl K4M at -20ºC, and
polymerized by ultraviolet irradiation. Ultrathin sections of
60 nm thickness were obtained by using an ultramicrotome
(Ultracut UCT, Leica, Germany), mounted on nickel
grids, and sequentially incubated with 0.1 M glycine in
PBS for 15 min and 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min, and the
primary antibodies diluted in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.6)
containing 1% BSA and 0.1 M glycine. The incorporation
of 5’-FU into nascent RNA was detected with the mouse
monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody; sections were incubated
for 2 h at 37ºC. After labeling for 5’-FU incorporation,
ultrathin sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal
anti-DKK1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #4687)
overnight at RT. Subsequently, ultrathin sections were then
incubated with secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse IgG, coupled to 10 nm or 15 nm gold particles,
respectively (BioCell; diluted 1:50 in PBS containing
1% BSA). Following immunogold labeling, the grids
were stained with uranyl acetate and examined under a
Phillips EM208 electron microscope operated at 60 kV. As
controls, ultrathin sections were treated as described above
but omitting primary antibodies.

Western blotting
Western blotting analyses were performed
as described [53]. Antibodies: DKK-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-14949; Cell Signaling Technology
#4687), β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T4026), c-MYC
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-40, clone 9E10), cyclin
D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-718), lamin B (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6216), V5 (Invitrogen, R960-25),
β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, #5125, clone 13E5),
phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, #9251), JNK
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-474), phospho-GS S641
(Cell Signaling Technology, #3891), GS (Cell Signaling
Technology, #3886, clone 15B1). Specific DKK-1
antibody blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Y-17P) was used for control purposes.

ChIP-sequencing assay

In situ transcriptional activity

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments
were performed basically as described [57] using a DKK-1
antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (#4687). ChIP
samples were processed into sequencing libraries with a
ChIP-Seq sample preparation kit (Illumina) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, each sample
was electrophoresed on agarose gel and a fraction of 100-

Active transcription sites were labelled by
incorporation of 5’-fluorouridine (5’-FU, Sigma) into
nascent RNA as described [56]. Briefly, cells were grown
to subconfluence on glass coverslips. 5’-FU was added to
the culture medium at 2 mM for 20 min. The cells were
then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in HPEM buffer

200 bp was taken. Extracted DNA was processed through
subsequent enzymatic treatments of end-repair, dA-tailing,
and ligation to adapters as in Illumina’s “ChIP Sequencing
Sample Prep Guide” (part # 11257047 Rev. A), with the
exception that gel extraction was replaced with Agencourt
AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) bead purification. Each
adapter-ligated library was PCR amplified with Illumina
PE primers for 15 cycles. Independent aliquots were
done with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA pol (Finnzymes
Reagents) and Accuprime GC Rich pol (Invitrogen), and
pooled after amplification. The resulting purified DNA
libraries were applied to an Illumina flow cell for cluster
generation and sequenced on the Genome Analyzer IIx
(GAIIx; Illumina) following manufacturer’s protocols.
Unfiltered 40 bp sequence reads were aligned
against the human reference genome hg18 (NCBI build
36.1, March 2006) using Illumina’s ELANDv2 algorithm
on its “eland_extended” mode from within CASAVA-1.7
package. Raw sequences were defined as reads passing
purity filter before genome alignment. Only the reads with
a unique alignment in the reference genome (“s_N_sorted.
txt” files) were used for the peak detection, which was
performed with MACS (Model-based Analysis of ChIPSeq). Peaks were called selecting default parameters for
P value cut-off (default 1e-5) and modelfold (10, 30) for
high-confidence fold-enrichment, where genomic DNA of
mock and input samples were used as negative controls.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS
v13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All reported P values
are two-sided. Prognostic and predictive effects were
assessed using as clinical endpoints progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from metastatic
event. PFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis
of metastatic disease to the date when progression was
confirmed. OS from metastatic event was determined as
the time elapsed from the date of metastasis diagnosis to
the date of death from any cause or the date of last followup. The prognostic analysis considered the influence
of factors in all patients using simple Cox proportional
hazards modeling on PFS and OS, and in multivariable
models adjusting for other prognostic factors in this
population. Kaplan-Meier curves were also plotted. For
the predictive analysis, Cox proportional hazards models
were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs
for metastatic treatment received stratified by factor status.
This work was performed in accordance with Reporting
Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies
(REMARK) guidelines [59]. In vitro results were
expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise specified.
ANOVA test was used for analysis of DKK-1 and target
genes in human samples.

Microarray analyses were performed using RNAs
obtained from three independent dishes of DLD-1/Mock
and DLD-1/DKK-1 cells that were treated with doxycyclin
(10 µg/ml) for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated
using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to supplier’s
specifications. The quantity and quality of the total RNAs
obtained were determined using 6000 Nano Chips (Agilent
Technologies). Total RNA samples were then processed
for hybridization on Gene Chip Human Gene 1.0 ST
Array (Affymetrix) using standard Affymetrix protocols
at the Genomics and Proteomics Facility of Centro de
Investigación del Cáncer (Salamanca, Spain).
Analysis for differential expression was performed
using the R platform for statistical analysis (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna) and several packages
from the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.
org/). The raw data were imported into R and preprocessed
using the affy package and the robust multichip average
method. To identify differentially expressed genes,
we used the limma package. Correction for multiple
testing was accomplished by controlling the FDR using
published methods [58]. The experimental settings and
raw data obtained in this experiment are deposited in GEO
