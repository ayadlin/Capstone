Abstract

Introduction

Oncogenic activation of the BRAF serine/threonine kinase
has been associated with initiation and maintenance of
melanoma tumors. As such, development of pharmacologic
agents to target RAF proteins or their effector kinases is an
area of intense investigation. Here we report the biological
properties of GDC-0879, a highly selective, potent, and orally
bioavailable RAF small-molecule inhibitor. We used extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-1/2 phosphorylation as
biomarkers to explore the relationship between tumor
outcome and pharmacodynamic inhibition of the RAF-MEKERK pathway. In GDC-0879–treated mice, both cell line– and
patient-derived BRAFV600E tumors exhibited stronger and
more sustained pharmacodynamic inhibition (>90% for
8 hours) and improved survival compared with mutant
KRAS–expressing tumors. Despite the involvement of activated RAF signaling in RAS-induced tumorigenesis, decreased
time to progression was observed for some KRAS-mutant
tumors following GDC-0879 administration. Moreover, striking differences were noted for RAF and MEK inhibition
across a panel of 130 tumor cell lines. Whereas GDC-0879–
mediated efficacy was associated strictly with BRAFV600E
status, MEK inhibition also attenuated proliferation and
tumor growth of cell lines expressing wild-type BRAF (81%
KRAS mutant, 38% KRAS wild type). The responsiveness of
BRAFV600E melanoma cells to GDC-0879 could be dramatically altered by pharmacologic and genetic modulation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway activity. These data
suggest that GDC-0879–induced signaling changes are dependent on the point of oncogenic activation within the RAS
network. Taken together, these studies increase our understanding of the molecular determinants for antitumor
efficacy resulting from RAF pathway inhibition and have
implications for therapeutic intervention in the clinic.

RAF protein kinases have been implicated in cellular responses
relevant to tumorigenesis, including cell proliferation, invasion,
survival, and angiogenesis (1, 2). The RAF family is composed of
three members, ARAF, BRAF, and RAF1, which play a pivotal role in
transducing signals from RAS to downstream kinases, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-1/2 and ERK-1/2. Activating somatic
mutations in BRAF are frequently observed in several tumor types,
including malignant melanoma (3) and colorectal carcinoma (4).
Almost 90% of these BRAF mutations are a T1799A transversion in
exon 15 that results in a Val600Glu (V600E) amino acid substitution
in the activation segment of the kinase. This mutation obviates the
requirement for the Thr599 and Ser602 phosphorylation that
occurs during normal BRAF activation and leads to constitutive
kinase activity that is 500-fold greater than that of wild-type
protein (5, 6). In melanoma, BRAF mutation has been reported in
premalignant atypical or dysplastic nevi and may thereby implicate
BRAF activation as an initiating event in tumorigenesis (7). Tumor
maintenance of melanoma cell lines in vivo is also highly
dependent on BRAFV600E (8, 9). Experiments with BRAF-specific
inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) show that BRAFV600E
silencing in an established tumor inhibits further tumor progression, and in some tumor xenograft models the loss of BRAFV600E
resulted in complete tumor regression (9). This effect was caused
by loss of proliferation, increased apoptosis, and macrophage
infiltration. Taken together, BRAF represents an excellent target for
anticancer therapy based on epidemiology, preclinical target
validation, and drugability of protein kinases.
There are currently numerous efforts to develop therapeutic
agents to target BRAF or its downstream kinases (10). The first RAF
inhibitor to enter clinical development was the multikinase
inhibitor Nexavar (sorafenib tosylate), which is now approved for
the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the broad
selectivity profile of this inhibitor makes it unsuitable for proofof-concept evaluation of RAF kinase inhibition in tumors (11).
Recently, more selective RAF inhibitors have been disclosed, and
chemical inhibition of BRAF enzymatic activity using these
compounds can result in diminished proliferation and survival of
tumor cells in vitro (12, 13). However, only very limited in vivo data
have been published for these inhibitors. For instance, daily
administration of SB-590885 resulted in a slight delay of tumor
growth for one BRAF-mutant melanoma xenograft model (12). This
effect was consistent with the modest reduction (50–80%) in

phospho-ERK levels observed in tumors for this compound. P.o.
administration of another compound, PLX4720, was shown to be
very efficacious in two BRAFV600E tumor models; however, there
was no suggestion of the kinetics or magnitude of downstream
pathway modulation that was required for antitumor efficacy (13).
Clearly, a more extensive preclinical validation of RAF inhibitors
in tumors of varying genotypes and a thorough pharmacodynamic
characterization of pathway inhibition are essential to achieving
the important goal of targeting RAF signaling for clinical benefit
while maintaining a significant therapeutic window. As such, novel
small-molecule antagonists to inhibit RAF enzymatic activity were
synthesized (14), and here we describe the biological effects of two
highly selective molecules with excellent potency and oral
bioavailability, GDC-0879 and compound 2a. GDC-0879 was used
to explore the dependency of cell lines and tumors with BRAF or
KRAS mutant genotypes on phospho-ERK signaling to maintain
cellular proliferation and tumor growth. GDC-0879 and compound
2a were also tested for antitumor efficacy in a large panel of
xenograft models derived from either cell lines or primary human
tumors and their efficacy correlated with pharmacodynamic end
points in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. All cell lines were acquired from American Type Culture
Collection and maintained at 37jC and 5% CO2 in DMEM or RPMI 1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mmol/L L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin.
Nontargeting and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)–specific small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon. Antibodies used
for immunoblotting were as follows: anti–phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204),
anti-ERK1/2, anti–phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), anti-MEK1, and anti–hactin (Cell Signaling Technology) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce Biotechnology). Doxycyline-HCl
was purchased from BD Biosciences. Compound 2a, GDC-0879, and
sorafenib were administered as a suspension in 0.5% methylcellulose 0.2%
Tween 80 (MCT) at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Dosing solutions were
prepared once per week and stored at 4jC.
Cell viability assays. Cells were seeded at 2,000 per well in 384-well
plates overnight. On day 2, nine serial 1:2 compound dilutions were made in
DMSO in a 96-well plate. The compounds were further diluted into growth
media using a Rapidplate robot (Zymark Corp.). The diluted compounds
were then added to quadruplicate wells in 384-well cell plates and
incubated at 37jC and 5% CO2. After 4 d, the relative numbers of viable cells
were measured by luminescence using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and read on a Wallac Multilabel Reader
(Perkin-Elmer). EC50 values were calculated using Prism 4.0 software
(GraphPad). Combination assays were dosed starting at 4 EC50 drug
concentrations. GDC-0879 and GDC-0941 were added simultaneously. For
synergy calculations, the combination index between GDC-0879 and GDC0941 was assessed by the method of Chou and Talalay using Calcusyn
software (Biosoft). Combination index values <0.4 indicate a synergistic
inhibition of cell viability.
Immunoblotting and ELISA. Frozen tumors were pulverized on dry ice
using a small Bessman tissue pulverizer (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.) and
protein extracts were prepared at 4jC with Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), and
one tablet of Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics).
Tissue lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 16,100  g for 30 min and
protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method
(Bradford 1976). ELISA kits were used to determine levels of phosphorylated
and total MEK1 in 96-well format (Biosource International) and samples
were analyzed in duplicate at 75 mg protein/well according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbances obtained at 450 nm were
converted to units per milliliter (phospho-MEK1) or nanograms per
milliliter (total MEK1) using a standard curve determined with recombinant

www.aacrjournals.org

proteins. The phospho-MEK1/total MEK1 ratios were then calculated as
units per nanogram.
For Western blot analysis, tumor protein extracts were prepared from
frozen tumors as described above. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.).
Total and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and h-actin were
detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).
Microarray analysis and statistical methods. A375 cells were treated
with 10 Amol/L of compound 2a, GDC-0879, or sorafenib for 24 h. Cells
cultured in regular medium were used as a control. Inducible shRNA A375
cell clones have been described previously (9) and were treated with 1 mg/
mL doxycycline for 3 d. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA
isolation kit (Qiagen) from at least two independent cell cultures.
Complementary RNA was synthesized and hybridized to Affymetrix human
genome 133 Plus 2.0 arrays (HGU133P). For all probe sets, an ANOVA was
applied to estimate the expression and accompanying variability for each of
the treatment groups. Additionally, fold change estimates for treated versus
untreated cultures were computed. The Benjamini and Hochberg false
discovery rate was applied as a multiple test correction. Gene ontologies
were assigned using the information provided by the Gene Ontology
Consortium.6
Tumor xenograft models. Cultured cells were resuspended in PBS,
mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and were implanted s.c. into the
right flank of naı̈ve female nu/nu mice. Mice with tumors of a mean volume
of 200 to 250 mm3 were grouped into treatment cohorts. For in vivo studies
done at Oncotest GmbH, tumor fragments obtained from MEXF 274, MEXF
535, MEXF 1341, MEXF 989, MEXF 276, MEXF 514, LXFA 629, LXFA 983, and
LXFA 1041 xenografts in serial passage were cut into 1- to 2-mm pieces and
placed in RPMI 1640 until bilateral, s.c. implantation into NMRI nu/nu mice
(Taconic). When tumors reached an average of 100 mm3, animals were
stratified into two equivalent groups of 10 tumor-bearing mice.
RAF inhibitors were formulated in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80
and administered daily by oral gavage. Body weights and caliper measurements were taken twice per week during the study. Tumor volumes were
calculated by the following formula: Tumor Volume = 0.5  (a  b 2), where
a is the largest tumor diameter and b is the perpendicular tumor diameter.
Tumor volume results are presented as mean tumor volume F SE. Percent
growth inhibition at the end of study (EOS) was calculated as %INH = 100 
[(EOS Vehicle
EOS Treatment) / (EOS Vehicle)]. Data analysis and
generation of P values using the Dunnett t test (15) was done using JMP
software.
Immunohistochemistry. Xenograft tissues were fixed for 24 h in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and were then processed and paraffin embedded.
Sections were cut at a thickness of 3 Am, and specimens with sufficient
viable tumor (assessed on H&E-stained slides) were further evaluated by
immunohistochemistry. Anti–Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, mouse anti-human) was
used with the DAKO ARK Kit for detection. Anti–panendothelial cell marker
(clone MECA-32, monoclonal rat anti-mouse) and anti–phospho-MAPK
Thr202/Tyr204 (clone 20G11, monoclonal rabbit anti-human) were both
used with a standard avidin-biotin HRP detection system. Tissues were
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. In all cases,
antigen retrieval was done with the DAKO Target Retrieval Kit as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
For quantification of immunohistochemically Ki-67–positive cells,
images were acquired by the Ariol SL-50 automated slide-scanning platform
(Genetix Ltd.) at 100 final magnification, and tumor-specific areas were
identified manually for analysis in the Ariol software. A 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine–specific color range was specified using the hue, saturation, and
intensity color space to quantify the area of staining and the output was
total Ki-67–positive cells in relation to total cell count. To analyze Ariol
scanned images of MECA-32, tumor-specific areas were exported for
analysis in the Metamorph software package (MDS Analytical Technologies)
as individual 8-bit images. A segmentation algorithm identified vessels and

Results
GDC-0879 is a potent and selective RAF kinase inhibitor.
Medicinal chemistry efforts generated a series of compounds based
on a substituted pyrazole core to produce ATP-competitive RAF
kinase inhibitors with excellent potency and physiochemical
properties (14). In particular, GDC-0879 and compound 2a
(Fig. 1A) show significant, equipotent inhibition of wild-type BRAF,
BRAFV600E, and CRAF as determined by in vitro inhibition of
purified enzymes (14). For both compounds, subnanomolar enzyme
potency translated into very effective reduction of phospho-ERK
levels (compound 2a and GDC-0879 IC50 values were 33 and
63 nmol/L, respectively) and cellular viability of BRAF-mutant
Malme3M cells (EC50 values were 0.46 and 0.75 Amol/L for
compound 2a and GDC-0879, respectively).
To determine the selectivity profile of these RAF inhibitors across
a larger fraction of the kinome, GDC-0879 was screened against a
panel of 140 full-length protein kinases at a final concentration of
1 Amol/L. In these assays, RAF kinases were inhibited by >90%
and only one additional kinase, casein kinase-1y, showed >50%
inhibition in vitro (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, we assessed
changes in global gene expression of BRAFV600E A375 melanoma
cells in response to treatment with 10 Amol/L of GDC-0879,
compound 2a, or sorafenib for 24 hours. As a comparator, we used
the previously described tetracycline-inducible shRNA expression
system to achieve conditional and selective genetic knockdown of
BRAF in A375 cells (9). Encouragingly, unsupervised hierarchical
clustering revealed a strong similarity in gene modulation resulting
from either treatment with compound 2a or GDC-0879 or genetic
ablation of BRAF mediated by RNA interference relative to DMSOtreated control samples (Fig. 1B). We further analyzed these
changes by testing their association with the biological processes
arrayed in the Gene Ontology database. Genes most significantly
down-regulated by selective RAF inhibition were strongly associated
with cell proliferation (Supplementary Table S2). Given the
numerous kinases that are inhibited by sorafenib, it was not
unexpected that gene expression induced by this compound
differed considerably from that of the RAF-specific reagents. Taken
together, these data show the remarkable kinase specificity of GDC0879 and compound 2a and support the use of these inhibitors in
further investigations of RAF signaling and biology.
The inhibition of MEK1/2 phosphorylation on the key activation
segment residues S217/221 was also determined for this chemical
series using a small panel of tumor cell lines. Representative GDC0879 dose-response curves for phospho-MEK are shown for A375
(BRAF V600E melanoma), A2058 (BRAF V600E melanoma), and
HCT116 (KRASG13D colon cancer) cells in culture (Fig. 1C). It was
noted that inhibition of MEK-ERK signaling was attenuated in the
KRAS-mutant cell line relative to tumor cells in which pathway
activation was induced directly by oncogenic BRAF. This
observation led us to investigate the GDC-0879 responsiveness of
a larger panel of BRAF-, KRAS-, and NRAS-mutant tumor cell lines.
Cellular activity of GDC-0879 on tumor cell lines expressing
oncogenic BRAF or RAS. The potency of GDC-0879 for a panel of
melanoma, colorectal, and non–small-cell lung cancer cell lines is
shown in Fig. 2. The cell lines were further classified according to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

their BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS genotypes. Tumor cells with
oncogenic mutations in either KRAS or NRAS showed limited
dependence on BRAF activity and were frequently resistant to
GDC-0879 treatment in vitro (EC50 > 7.5 Amol/L for 28 of 32 cell
lines). However, there was a good correlation between GDC-0879
sensitivity and activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene. Cells
with GDC-0879 EC50 values <0.5 Amol/L all express V600E
oncogenic alleles for BRAF (A375, 624, SK-MEL-28, Malme3M,
C32, 928, 888, G-361, Colo205, Colo206, SW1417, CL34, and
Colo201). Moreover, few BRAF-mutant cell lines were highly
resistant to RAF inhibition. Of these resistant cell lines, HT-55
and H2405 carry atypical, and as yet uncharacterized, genetic
aberrations within the BRAF gene (N581Y and L485Y, respectively).
BRAFV600E mutant HT29 cells were unexpectedly insensitive to
GDC-0879 (Fig. 2). However, HT29 cells have been shown to exhibit
high UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (16), and drug conjugation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases might function as
an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to GDC-0879 in some cell
lines. Lastly, although relatively weak in vitro activity was observed
for BRAFV600E LOX-IMVI melanoma cells in culture (10 Amol/L),
dramatic in vivo efficacy was observed using tumor xenografts
derived from this cell line (Supplementary Table S3).
Although little is known about resistance mechanisms for RAF
inhibitors, compensatory signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway has recently been suggested to
underlie genetic resistance to BRAF-MEK inhibitors in some cases
(17). Because AKT activation can occur as a result of activating
mutations in PIK3CA or loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor, we
carefully examined the mutational status of these genes in our
collection of BRAF-mutant cell lines. In no instances did BRAFV600E
cell lines that were highly sensitive to GDC-0879 have either
established hotspot mutations of PIK3CA (E545K, H1047R) or loss
of PTEN protein as determined by immunoblotting with a PTENspecific antibody (data not shown). In contrast, some cell lines with
considerably less dependence on BRAF activity for proliferation
(A2058, RPMI-7951, RKO-AS45-1, and RKO) carried mutations
predicted to deregulate PI3K signaling (data not shown). DNA
sequencing of RKO-AS45-1 and RKO cells (EC50 values of 1.16 and
9.16 Amol/L, respectively) revealed PIK3CAH1047R driver mutations.
Furthermore, A2058 and RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (EC50 values of
7 and 20 Amol/L, respectively) were confirmed to contain large
deletions within the PTEN gene. Consistent with this hypothesis,
combined treatment of A2058 (BRAFV600E, PTEN / ) cells with
GDC-0879 and GDC-0941, a highly selective and potent inhibitor of
class I PI3Ks that is currently in phase I clinical testing (18),
resulted in synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation over a broad
range of drug concentrations as determined by the Chou and
Talalay method of combination index (combination index = 0.23,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 2B). PI3K signaling was also induced via genetic
ablation of PTEN in a GDC-0879–sensitive cell line, MDA-MB-435S
(BRAFV600E) melanoma cells (19). Elevated PI3K signaling resulted
in significant resistance to GDC-0879–mediated inhibition of cell
proliferation (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2C). Comparable PTEN knockdown
results were observed for distinct siRNA duplexes, and GDC-0879
resistance was evident over a wide range of GDC-0879 concentrations. Moreover, inhibition of basal PI3K signaling via dual
knockdown of PIK3CA and PIK3CB sensitized cells to GDC-0879
(P < 0.0001). Taken together, our cellular data suggest that positive
(BRAF mutation) and potential negative (PIK3CA and PTEN
mutation) predictors of response to the RAF inhibitors can be
identified.

RAF Inhibition in Cells Expressing Mutant BRAF and KRAS

GDC-0879 and compound 2a are highly efficacious in
BRAFV600E tumor xenograft models. The key physical properties
of GDC-0879 and compound 2a, such as hydrophilicity and
solubility at neutral pH, result in good pharmacokinetic profiles
and high exposure of these compounds in several preclinical
species (data not shown). For instance, following p.o. administration of 25 mg/kg GDC-0879 to CD-1 mice, the maximum plasma
concentration reached 5.5 Ag/mL and the drug half-life in plasma
was 3.8 hours. Area under the plasma concentration time curve
increased linearly with dose, and bioavailability was estimated to
range between 49% and 65%. From these data, it is predicted that
efficacious exposure levels of GDC-0879 and compound 2a are
attainable and that these compounds can be used for validation of
RAF catalytic activity for the maintenance of tumors in vivo.
To extend our in vitro observations, the breadth of GDC-0879
and compound 2a antitumor activity was evaluated using flank
xenograft models established from human tumor cell lines of
known BRAF and KRAS mutation status. We implanted a panel of
melanoma, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer cell lines (n = 9)
in nude mice. Following tumor establishment (200–250 mm3),
animals were dosed once daily with 100 mg/kg GDC-0879 by oral

gavage and tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement.
As shown in Supplementary Table S3, administration of a selective
RAF inhibitor prevented tumor growth exclusively in cell line–
derived tumor xenografts that were BRAFV600E mutant. Daily
treatment for 21 consecutive days induced significant tumor
responses in LOX-IMVI, A375, and Colo205 xenografts (93%, 85%,
and 53% tumor inhibition, respectively). Rapid tumor regression
was observed for the majority of LOX-IMVI tumor–bearing mice
and complete responses (regression of the established tumor
beyond the level of detection by palpation) or partial responses
(shrinkage of at least 50% relative to starting tumor volume) were
observed in 10% and 70% of the animals, respectively. Chronic
GDC-0879 treatment was well tolerated with minimal body weight
loss at this dose, and only mild skin acanthosis and hyperkeratosis
were noted on histologic examination. None of the examined
xenograft models that were wild-type for BRAF showed tumor
inhibition exceeding f10%, further supporting that in vivo efficacy
of GDC-0879 correlates well with cellular activity.
To more closely investigate the activity and cellular mechanism
of action within sensitive tumor types, compound 2a was
benchmarked against sorafenib using BRAFV600E LOX-IMVI tumor

Figure 2. BRAFV600E mutation predicts for enhanced sensitivity of melanoma, colon, and lung cancer cell lines to RAF inhibitors in vitro. A, GDC-0879 EC50 values
were determined for a panel of human tumor cell lines. Cell lines were also assessed for RAS-RAF genotype: BRAF mutation (white ), KRAS mutation (light gray ),
NRAS mutation (hatched ), and wild-type (WT ; dark gray ). B, inhibition of PI3K sensitizes GDC-0879–resistant melanoma cells to RAF inhibition. A2058 (BRAFV600E,
PTEN / ) melanoma cells were treated with RAF inhibitor (GDC-0879), PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941), or the combination of the two compounds. The highest
concentration of each drug was 4 EC50 of each compound, and 2-fold serial dilutions were assessed in an eight-point dilution curve. Cells were incubated in the
presence of compounds for 4 d and analyzed by a CellTiter-Glo viability assay. All treatments were done in quadruplicate. A significant combinatorial activity was
observed (*, P < 0.01; **, P < 0.0001, Student’s t test). C, PTEN knockdown induces GDC-0879 resistance in mutant BRAF–expressing cells. MDA-MB-435S
(BRAFV600E) melanoma cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNA for 72 h before treatment with 0, 1, or 10 Amol/L of GDC-0879 for an additional 72 h. Nontarget
control (NTC ), PTEN, and PIK3CA/PIK3CB siRNA duplexes (PIK3CA/B ) were used as indicated. Cellular viability was determined by CellTiter-Glo assay and
normalized to untreated, NTC-transfected cells. PTEN knockdown using distinct siRNA duplexes resulted in significant resistance to GDC-0879 compared with
NTC-transfected cells treated with either 1 or 10 Amol/L GDC-0879 (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.0001, Student’s t test). In contrast, combined knockdown of PIK3CA and

equivalent doses (50 mg/kg daily) and suitable plasma exposure
was achieved (4.2 F 0.6 and 23 F 12.8 Amol/L at 1 hour after last
dose for compound 2a and sorafenib, respectively). Antitumor
efficacy was durable throughout the dosing period and the
observed tumor inhibition was significantly greater for compound
2a (66.5%, P = 0.0011) than for sorafenib (38.7%, P = 0.0438)
relative to vehicle-treated cohorts. Moreover, tumors that were
collected from mice dosed for 4 days revealed that only
compound 2a treatment was accompanied by a robust decrease
in proliferating cells as determined by Ki-67 immunoreactivity in
tumors (Fig. 3B and C). Compound 2a treatment did not play a
pivotal role in regulating vascularization of BRAFV600E tumors as
determined by staining with the panendothelial cell marker,

MECA-32 (Fig. 3B and D). In comparison, sorafenib treatment did
not affect the proliferative index of the tumor but rather led to a
reduction of tumor vascular density (possibly via inhibition of
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling; ref. 11). No differences for
tumor cell apoptosis were noted at day 4 for either inhibitor as
determined by cleaved caspase-3 staining (data not shown). Taken
together, these results provide substantial in vivo support of the
current view that RAF family signaling and catalytic activity are
important for driving tumor cell proliferation and suggest a
unique mechanism of action compared with some published
inhibitors, such as sorafenib.

RAF Inhibition in Cells Expressing Mutant BRAF and KRAS

(Supplementary Table S3), A375 (BRAFV600E) and SK23 (BRAF wildtype) melanoma xenograft models were used as comparators to
evaluate the relationship between in vivo efficacy and pharmacodynamic modulation of RAF effector signaling. Daily p.o. administration of 50 or 100 mg/kg GDC-0879 yielded 65% and 85%
inhibition of tumor volumes relative to vehicle-treated A375
tumors (Fig. 4A). The observed efficacy was significantly less for
SK23 tumors, although the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma drug
concentration was comparable between xenograft models (Fig. 4B;
data not shown). In parallel to these efficacy experiments,
additional cohorts of A375 and SK23 tumor-bearing mice were
treated with a single dose of vehicle or 100 mg/kg GDC-0879.
Tumor tissue was subsequently harvested at 1, 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours
as indicated (Fig. 4C and D). Administration of GDC-0879 resulted
in profound pathway modulation in A375 tumors collected at early
time points (13 F 4% and 28 F 17% activity remaining at 1 and
4 hours post-dose, respectively) as determined by measurement of
MEK1 phosphorylation of Ser217/221 (Fig. 4C). Reduced levels of
phospho-MEK1 were still evident 8 hours post-dose (59 F 21%) but
returned to baseline after 12 hours. In comparison, pharmacodynamic analysis of SK23 tumors revealed only modest, variable
inhibition of phospho-MEK1 levels at 1, 4, and 8 hours, although
baseline MEK1 phosphorylation was equivalent to that of A375
tumors (Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Thr202/Tyr204) further confirmed that significant, sustained
pharmacodynamic modulation occurred in A375, but not SK23,
tumors (Fig. 4C and D). As a control, no differences were noted for
total ERK1/2 or actin protein levels in this experiment. Moreover,
the kinetics of phospho-ERK inhibition determined by immunohistochemical analysis of A375 tumors were also in agreement with
results obtained from whole tumor lysates (Supplementary

Fig. S1A). Despite the transient pharmacodynamic modulation
observed for daily dosing, GDC-0879 administration over consecutive days resulted in sustained inhibition of A375 tumor cell
proliferation as determined by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry at 4
and 24 hours post-dose (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Taken together,
the magnitude and duration of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK
reduction correlated well with antitumor efficacy resulting from
inhibition of RAF catalytic activity in cell line–derived melanoma
xenograft models.
The pharmacodynamics-efficacy relationship for RAF inhibition
was further evaluated using human tumors that have been
transplanted and passaged directly in athymic mice. In contrast
to cell line–derived tumors, these primary tumor xenografts
maintain their original tumor histology and are considered to
have molecular characteristics and drug sensitivities that better
mirror the original patient tumor (20). For our experiments, six
patient-derived melanomas and three patient-derived non–smallcell lung adenocarcinomas were genotyped for RAS/BRAF activating mutations and used for GDC-0879 in vivo studies. As would be
predicted from our previous experiments, tumors with wild-type
alleles of BRAF were resistant to GDC-0879 (Supplementary
Table S4). However, patient-derived BRAFV600E melanomas were
highly sensitive to RAF inhibition and either tumor stasis (MEXF
514) or partial regression (MEXF 989, MEXF 276) was observed.
GDC-0879 efficacy for BRAFV600E tumors was significant (P <
0.0001) when analyzed as time to tumor progression from KaplanMeier curves (Fig. 5A). Although NRAS has also been suggested to
be an initiating event in melanoma tumor formation and is known
to signal strongly through RAF kinases, only a slight delay (P = 0.01)
in tumor growth was noted for one NRASQ61K model (MEXF 535)
treated with GDC-0879. This suggests that RAF inhibition may not

be sufficient to prevent melanoma tumor maintenance and
progression in the context of oncogenic NRAS signaling.
As shown in Fig. 5A, an unexpected decrease in median tumor
doubling time (LXFA 1041, P = 0.002; LXFA 983, P = 0.1) was
observed for KRAS-mutant tumors following GDC-0879 treatment
relative to control cohorts. End-of-study tumor volumes were also
increased in response to GDC-0879 treatment (LXFA 1041,
P = 0.009; LXFA 983, P = 0.04; data not shown). Given the
negative interaction between GDC-0879 efficacy and KRAS
mutation observed in these patient-derived non–small-cell lung
cancer tumors, RAF effector signaling was investigated in tumor
samples collected at 1, 8, or 24 hours after the final dose (Fig. 5B).
Administration of GDC-0879 resulted in profound knockdown of
phospho-ERK1/2 levels at both 1 and 8 hours post-dose in
BRAFV600E tumors. In comparison, tumors with KRAS or NRAS
mutation showed only a slight decrease in phospho-ERK1/2 at the
1-hour time point with a recovery of RAF effector signaling in
<8 hours. Notably, phospho-ERK1/2 measured 8 hours after GDC0879 treatment even significantly exceeded baseline levels in
vehicle-treated control samples for some tumor models, such as
LXFA 1041. Taken together, phospho-ERK1/2 is a suitable
pharmacodynamic end point for tumor xenografts, and the
magnitude (>90% inhibition) and duration (>8 hours) of signal

reduction strongly correlate with the observed antitumor efficacy.
Furthermore, transient elevation or ‘‘rebound’’ of ERK1/2 signaling
resulting from GDC-0879 administration on a daily dosing
schedule may lead to a cumulative increase in growth rate as
observed for some non–small-cell lung cancer tumors with KRAS
activating mutations.
Comparison of RAF and MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.
Given the limited responses observed for RAF inhibitors in BRAF
wild-type tumors, we compared the activity of GDC-0879 with that
of a known non–ATP-competitive inhibitor of MEK1/2 kinases, PD0325901 (21). Initially, in vivo efficacy studies were done using the
HCT116 tumor xenograft model (KRASG13D genotype). Given that
RAF kinases are direct upstream activators of MEK1/2 (1, 2), a
similar efficacy might be expected from catalytic inhibition of
either target. However, a dramatic difference in antitumor efficacy
was observed for HCT116 tumors treated with either GDC-0879 or
MEK inhibitor at their respective maximum tolerated doses (100
and 25 mg/kg daily; Fig. 6A and B). Whereas GDC-0879 treatment
did not prevent the growth of established xenograft tumors, in vivo
inhibition of MEK signaling resulted in a significant proportion of
partial (20%) and complete (20%) tumor responses using this
KRAS-mutant model (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the antitumor activity
of MEK inhibitor was correlated with strong (f90%) and sustained

(>6 hours) inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in this BRAF wildtype xenograft model (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To further compare the genotype-correlated sensitivities of RAF
and MEK inhibitors, the compounds were profiled against a panel
of 130 cell lines representing broad genetic heterogeneity and
numerous tumor indications. The majority of GDC-0879–sensitive
cell lines harbored BRAF mutations (24 of 35; Fig. 6C). As such,
GDC-0879 activity was observed predominantly for tissues in which
BRAF mutation is prevalent, such as melanoma and colorectal
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S3A). MEK inhibitor treatment showed
greater overall potency in BRAFV600E cells and was also effective in
a significant proportion of KRAS-mutant (34 of 42) and BRAF/
KRAS wild-type (23 of 61) tumor lines (Fig. 6D). As such, a strong
inhibition of proliferation was noted for some tumor types in which
KRAS mutation is uncommon, such as breast and prostate cancers
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together, sensitivity to either
BRAF or MEK inhibition is well correlated with BRAF mutation in
tumor cell lines; however, only MEK inhibition is effective in
preventing tumor cell growth in the context of wild-type BRAF. It is
encouraging that the possible clinical utility of MEK inhibitors may
be broader than originally suggested from studies using a much
smaller cell line panel (21). The molecular features that distinguish
the MEK inhibitor–sensitive and MEK inhibitor–resistant subsets
of either oncogenic KRAS–expressing or KRAS/BRAF wild-type

cells are currently not well understood and further elucidation is
required.

Discussion
We describe here the properties of GDC-0879 and compound 2a,
orally bioavailable RAF family kinase inhibitors that exhibit robust
single-agent activity in vitro and in vivo. Because previous efforts to
validate the role of BRAF in oncogenesis have typically relied on
nonselective kinase inhibitors (11) or RNA interference approaches
to induce a steady-state suppression of MEK-ERK signaling (22),
the objective of our study was to provide quantitative information
on the kinetics of pathway suppression required for antitumor
efficacy. In contrast to other published reports of RAF-selective
compounds (12, 13), we correlated the efficacy of GDC-0879 with
proximal (substrate phosphorylation) and distal (tumor cell
proliferation) pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Phospho-MEK1/2
and phospho-ERK1/2 were validated as pharmacodynamic end
points, and the extent (>90%) and duration (>8 hours) of pathway
inhibition were shown to correlate with in vivo efficacy in a variety
of preclinical models (Figs. 4 and 5).
The contribution of RAS/RAF mutational status to in vitro and
in vivo efficacy was also extensively investigated. The signaling
mechanism to explain the potent cellular activity of MEK inhibition

BRAF, NRAS, and KRAS are indicated. A statistically significant (P < 0.05) delay in tumor progression was noted for MEXF 989, MEXF 276, and MEXF 535 tumors.
GDC-0879 administration significantly accelerated growth of some KRAS-mutant non–small cell lung cancer tumors, such as LXFA 1041 and LXFA 983. B, GDC-0879
treatment down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BRAFV600E primary human xenograft tumors. In time course pharmacodynamic studies, mice were treated
with 100 mg/kg GDC-0879 and sacrificed at 1 or 8 h following the last dose (days 21–24). Immunoblots of phosphorylated and total ERK1/2 are shown. Potent
phospho-ERK1/2 inhibition sustained through 8 h was strongly correlated with BRAFV600E status and GDC-0879 antitumor efficacy. Total ERK1/2 expression was
examined in all samples as a loading control.

RAF, prevented the in vivo growth of KRAS-mutant HCT116 tumors. Mice were randomized when tumors reached f200 mm3 and treatment was initiated with either

on cells that are resistant to RAF inhibitors is currently not
understood. Surprisingly, our in vivo efficacy studies with patientderived non–small-cell lung cancer tumors showed that some
KRAS-mutant tumors not only failed to show an antitumor benefit
from GDC-0879 but even exhibited accelerated tumor growth
(Fig. 5A). A possible negative interaction between GDC-0879 and
KRAS mutation requires further investigation and should be viewed
cautiously until confirmatory in vivo data using complementary
model systems are available. It is interesting, however, to speculate
on the molecular mechanisms behind the observed posttreatment
rebound of elevated phospho-ERK1/2 signaling (Fig. 5B). It is
possible that transient RAF inhibition may alter oncogenic KRAS
signaling by triggering the extensive network of positive and
negative regulatory loops that feed into the RAF/MEK/ERK kinase
cascade. For instance, temporal modulation of RAS signaling can
occur via induction of members of the MAPK phosphatase or
SPROUTY protein families (23, 24) or via direct feedback
phosphorylation to negatively regulate the association of RAF1RAS and SOS-GRB2 protein complexes (25, 26). In this way, RASmediated cellular responses have been shown to be context

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

dependent and affected by the prior exposure of a cell to signaling
stimuli and inhibitors (27). This feedback mechanism may be
important in the context of transient pathway inhibition resulting
from intermittent delivery of small-molecule inhibitors with high
C max exposure and rapid in vivo clearance.
RAF inhibitors were also shown to exhibit strong selectivity
toward tumor cells expressing oncogenic BRAF (Figs. 2A and 6C)
and particular tumor types, such as melanoma, colon cancer, and
ovarian cancer (Fig. 6D). In vivo data for GDC-0879 treatment of
both cell line– and patient tumor–derived preclinical models
further support the trend of BRAF V600E oncogene addiction
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Importantly, the sensitivity of
tumor cells to RAF inhibition was inversely correlated with PI3K
activation, and combined treatment of GDC-0879 and GDC-0941
effectively decreased the viability of melanoma cells having both
oncogenic BRAFV600E and PTEN deficiency (Fig. 2B and C). These
data provide a strong rationale for therapeutic combinations in
the clinic. Lastly, given the observed genotype-correlated drug
sensitivities, selection of the appropriate patient population is a
major issue facing the development of both RAF and MEK

material for RAS/BRAF genotype (Fig. 6) or expression signatures of
response (Fig. 1B) will help stratify patients most likely to benefit
from RAF inhibitor therapy.
