ABSTRACT
Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) is a highly conserved disulfide ­bondgenerating enzyme that is overexpressed in diverse tumor types. Its enzymatic
activity promotes the growth and invasion of tumor cells and alters extracellular
matrix composition. In a nude mouse-human tumor xenograft model, tumors
containing shRNA for QSOX1 grew significantly more slowly than controls, suggesting
that QSOX1 supports a proliferative phenotype in vivo. High throughput screening
experiments identified ebselen as an in vitro inhibitor of QSOX1 enzymatic activity.
Ebselen treatment of pancreatic and renal cancer cell lines stalled tumor growth
and inhibited invasion through Matrigel in vitro. Daily oral treatment with ebselen
resulted in a 58% reduction in tumor growth in mice bearing human pancreatic tumor
xenografts compared to controls. Mass spectrometric analysis of ebselen-treated
QSOX1 mechanistically revealed that C165 and C237 of QSOX1 covalently bound to
ebselen. This report details the anti-neoplastic properties of ebselen in pancreatic and
renal cancer cell lines. The results here offer a “proof-of-principle” that enzymatic
inhibition of QSOX1 may have clinical relevancy.

overall and relapse-free survival [3]. QSOX1 RNA is
elevated when expression of the transcriptional regulator
NKX3.1 is reduced in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
[5], suggesting that QSOX1 expression may contribute to
prostate cancer progression.
The predominant isoforms of QSOX1, QSOX-L
(long, 742a.a.) and QSOX1-S (short, 604a.a.) have
intra-  and extracellular functions related to growth,
invasion, and extracellular matrix structure and
function. In pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines,
QSOX1 expression is associated with a highly invasive
phenotype and the increased activation of matrix
metalloproteinase -2 and -9 [2, 3]. QSOX1 is required
for the proper incorporation of laminin α4 subunits into
the extracellular matrix (ECM), and reducing QSOX1

INTRODUCTION
QSOX1 is a highly conserved FAD-dependent
sulfhydryl oxidase that catalyzes disulfide bond formation
in reduced proteins and sulfhydryl-containing small
molecules. QSOX1 has been reported to be overexpressed
in diverse tumor types such as pancreatic [1, 2], breast
[3, 4], and prostate cancers [5], and is associated with a
proliferative and invasive phenotype [2, 3, 6]. QSOX1
expression is not detected in normal breast tissue and is
positively correlated with high grade breast tumors by
transcriptomic analyses of EST and SAGE databases, as
well as quantitative PCR of cDNA isolated from normal
and malignant breast tissue [4]. Increased QSOX1
expression in luminal B breast cancers predicts poor

sulfhydryls in the ECM [7].
Here we report that QSOX1 expression contributes
to tumor growth in an in vivo pancreatic tumor cell
xenograft model, supporting QSOX1 as a potential
molecular therapeutic target. A high-throughput screen of
the small molecule LOPAC1280 library identified ebselen
as a inhibitor of QSOX1 enzymatic activity in vitro. In
this study, we investigate the biological effects of QSOX1
inhibition and demonstrate, mechanistically, how ebselen
suppresses QSOX1 activity.

luminescent reaction. In the presence of a QSOX1 inhibitor,
the sulfhydryl oxidase activity of QSOX1 is blocked,
preventing disulfide bond formation and H2O2 production.
The relative inhibitory activity of LOPAC1280 is plotted
in Figure S1B. We identified ebselen (Figure S1C) as an
inhibitor of QSOX1 enzyme activity, with greater inhibitory
activity against QSOX1 than GOx (Figure S1D); the IC50
for ebselen inhibition of QSOX1 and GOx was determined
to be 5.4 μM and 20.5 μM, respectively. Confirmation of
ebselen’s inhibitory activity was obtained by HyPerBlu
luminescent detection (Figure S1D, middle plot) and HVAbased fluorescent assays showing decreased fluorescence as
inhibitor concentration increases (Figure S2).

QSOX1 expression drives increased tumor
growth in vivo

Ebselen reduces tumor cell invasion
One of the fundamental properties of malignant cells
leading to metastatic disease is invasion. Since ebselen
inhibits QSOX1, we hypothesized that it would suppress
invasion of tumor cells similar to shRNA-mediated
knockdown of QSOX1.
MIAPaCa-2, BXPC3, 786-O, and UOK117 cells
were incubated in matrigel-coated invasion chambers in
serum-free media in the presence of ebselen or vehicle.
Invading cells were quantified after 20 hours (Figure 2).
Isogenic MIAPaCa-2 lines were generated that express
shRNAs specific for QSOX1 (sh742 and sh528) or a
nonspecific sequence (shScr) (Figure  2A). shScr cells
exposed to 5 μM – 15 μM ebselen showed decreased
invasion compared to DMSO vehicle-treated cells, with
reductions of 91%, 94%, and 98%, respectively. sh742
cells showed greater than 60% decreased invasion
compared to shScr cells. Invasion was rescued to levels of
vehicle-treated shScr wells when 50 nM active rQSOX1
was added to sh742 wells at the initiation of the assay
(Figure 2A, sixth bar). rQSOX1 pre-incubated with
15 μM ebselen and then added to sh742 cells, however,
did not rescue invasion. These results suggest that one of

We hypothesized that suppressing QSOX1 levels
in tumors expressing shRNAs specific for QSOX1 would
slow their growth compared untreated and scrambled
shRNA control (shScr) cells. Tumors containing QSOX1
shRNAs (sh742 or sh528) grew at a reduced rate compared
to shScr control xenografts (Figure 1A). Tumor masses on
day 28 of the experiment showed that tumor growth was
reduced by 77% in tumors transduced with sh742, and
by 48% in tumors transduced with sh528 compared to
shScr tumors (Figure 1B, 1C). These results indicate that
QSOX1 expression promotes tumor growth in vivo and
suggest that QSOX1 could be a target for potential antineoplastic compounds.

Ebselen inhibits rQSOX1 activity in vitro
We used a sulfhydryl activity assay similar to the
one developed by Colin Thorpe’s group [8] to screen
recombinant QSOX1 against a library of pharmacologically
active compounds, LOPAC1280. In this enzymatic assay
(Supplementary Figure S1A), rQSOX1 oxidizes a reduced
RNAse A or DTT substrate, producing H2O2 detected by a

through QSOX1 inhibition.
We also quantified invasion in ebselen-treated
BXPC3, 786-O, and UOK117 cells (Figure 2B-2D).
Ebselen suppressed invasion in these tumor cell lines in
a concentration-dependent manner. At 5 μM, BXPC3
invasion was reduced by 85%, 89% for 786-O, and 40%
for UOK117. 10 μM ebselen treatment decreased BXPC3,
786-O, and UOK117 invasion by 95%, 97%, and 80%
compared to vehicle-treated cells, respectively. Near total
inhibition of invasion was observed for each cell line
treated with 15 μM ebselen. These results were statistically
significant in BXPC3 and UOK117 with p-values calculated
at < 0.05. Results for 786-O were not statistically significant
(p = 0.08 – 0.09), but show a similar dose-response.

at two clinically achievable doses to determine if ebselen
suppresses tumor growth in vivo. As shown in Figure 3,
daily treatment with ebselen at both high (640 μg) and low
(160  μg) doses suppressed tumor growth in MIAPaCa-2
nude mouse xenografts. There was no difference in tumor
size between high and low doses, but tumors in mice treated
with 160 μg ebselen were ~56% smaller than vehicletreated mice at day 28. There was no difference in the
average mouse weights between the vehicle and ebselentreated groups (Figure S3), suggesting that the observed
difference in tumor growth were not due decreased appetite
or decreased nutrient absorption in ebselen-treated mice.
Taken together, these results suggest that ebselen decreases
tumor growth in vivo.

58683 and 58860 Da, designated “A” and “B,” respectively,
corresponding to two post-translationally modified forms of
rQSOX1.
Treatment of QSOX1 with ebselen shows a mass
shift corresponding to two ebselen adducts per peak

of Figure 4A, rQSOX1 was also treated with ebselen in

remove ebselen from QSOX1.

resting QSOX1.

3 unique cleavage fragments (Figure  5A). Fragments
1, 2, and 3 had observed masses of 15668, 8063.1, and
35242 Da, respectively (black arrows in Figure  5A).
These masses correspond to cleavage with the expected
iminothiazolidine formation [12–15] on the N-terminal
side of cysteines 165 and 237 in QSOX1 as shown in the

The cyanyl group increases fragment masses by 25 Da
(fragments 2 and 3).

DISCUSSION
QSOX1 is an emerging target in tumor biology
given its roles in cell growth, invasion, and the regulation
of extracellular matrix composition [2–4, 7, 11, 16].
Secreted QSOX1 acts directly in the extracellular
matrix to enhance tumorigenic processes through poorly
understood mechanisms. Inhibition of QSOX1 activity
in the clinic has the potential to decrease the growth and
invasion of tumors, possibly containing primary growths
and increasing survival.
Here we establish that QSOX1 promotes tumor
growth in vivo, strengthening the connection between
elevated QSOX1 expression and tumor aggression
[3–5]. Xenografted MIAPaCa-2 tumors with stable
QSOX1 knockdowns grew at significantly reduced rates
compared to controls (Figure  1). These data support
other studies demonstrating a pro-tumorigenic role for
QSOX1 [2–7, 11, 16].

Identification of ebselen-binding
cysteines in QSOX1
We employed a cyanylation strategy to identify
ebselen-binding cysteines in resting QSOX1, utilizing
the
reagent
1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium
tetrafluoroborate (CDAP). CDAP cyanylates free, but not
disulfide-bound, cysteines in proteins; they are then cleaved
on the amino side of the CDAP-cysteine adduct when
subjected to alkaline conditions [12–15]. MALDI analysis

The enzymatic activity of QSOX1 is essential
for its roles in invasion and regulation of extracellular
matrix composition [3, 7]. An inhibitory antibody
recently developed blocks QSOX1 activity and reduces
the invasion of tumor cells across a fibroblast monolayer
[7], supporting the idea that directly targeting QSOX1
enzyme activity has anti-invasive properties. Thus, small
molecule inhibition of QSOX1 may have therapeutic
efficacy or reveal novel pathways in QSOX1 biology.
In a high throughput screen of the LOPAC1280
chemical library utilizing recombinant QSOX1, we
identified ebselen as an inhibitor of QSOX1 enzyme
activity. We used Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase
(GOx) as a general counter-screen to ensure that
inhibition was specific for QSOX1. Although both GOx
and QSOX1 contain FAD as a cofactor, the former uses
FAD as the initial electron acceptor [17], while FAD
serves as terminal electron acceptor in the QSOX1
Erv1 domain. In addition, the sequence and structure
of the two proteins are very different [18], sharing only
20% sequence identity. Thus the majority of genuine
inhibitors are expected to show strong preference for
QSOX1. As seen in supplementary Figure S1D, GOx
is inhibited by ebselen only at a concentration 4-fold
higher than was observed for QSOX1.
Since ebselen reacts with free cysteines and
both QSOX1 substrates and its own redox activity are
dependent on sulfhydryls, we were initially concerned
that the interaction of ebselen with QSOX1 substrates
DTT and RNAse A might make ebselen appear to inhibit
QSOX1 spuriously through substrate depletion. We used
between 150 and 2400-fold molar excesses of substrate
thiols over ebselen in confirmatory activity assays to guard
against this possibility (Figure S2). If the interaction of
ebselen with substrate was extensive, even with total
exhaustion of ebselen sufficient unreacted substrate would
be available for QSOX1 oxidation. These conditions
would allow for near-maximum signal to be detected,
preventing the identification of compounds with an
indiscriminate preference for free cysteines. Additionally,
rQSOX1 enzyme was always added last to reactions such
that ebselen was present with substrate before QSOX1
addition. Therefore, the excess substrate would deplete
available ebselen prior to the addition of active enzyme.
Ebselen treatment of tumor cell lines resulted in
significantly decreased invasion in trans-well invasion
assays compared to DMSO vehicle-treated cells (Figure 2).
These results are consistent with decreased invasion
in cells expressing QSOX1-specific shRNAs [2, 3, 7].
Importantly, rescue of invasion in QSOX1-knockdown
cells was achieved with the addition of 50 nM exogenous
recombinant QSOX1 enzyme (Figure   2A, fifth bar).
However, pre-incubation of recombinant enzyme with
15 μM ebselen prior to addition of QSOX1 to tumor cells
did not restore invasive activity (Figure 2A, sixth bar),

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggesting that ebselen inactivates QSOX1. In fact, tumor
cell invasion was further decreased compared to the sh742
knockdowns, underscoring the incomplete suppression of
gene expression using a shRNA system. These results
indicate that one mechanism by which ebselen decreases
tumor cell invasion is via QSOX1 enzymatic inhibition.
We investigated the growth modulatory effects
of ebselen in pancreatic and kidney cancer cell lines
(Figure S4). Ebselen was a poor inhibitor of growth in
kidney cancer cell lines, but did significantly inhibit
growth of pancreatic cell line MIAPaCa-2 at 10 μM
and 15  μM and BXPC3 at 15 μM. QSOX1 expression
was similar for the cell lines tested by western
blotting (Figure  S5), thus QSOX1 expression alone
fails to explain the growth effects observed. Viability
determinations showed that ebselen is not cytotoxic to
tumor cells (Figure S6), so decreased growth is therefore
attributable to reduced proliferation. Ebselen treatment
also causes tumor cells to “round up” (data not shown).
While anecdotal, this observation is consistent with the
morphological changes observed when QSOX1 expression
is suppressed by shRNAs [2, 3].
Incubation of 15 μM ebselen with normal
lymphocytes and non-malignant fibroblasts does not result
in toxicity (~98% viability after 48 hours, data not shown).
Additionally, ebselen has an established safety profile and
dosing in humans in phase II clinical trials for cerebral
infarct [19–21]. Patients in this 1998 clinical trial who
received ebselen had no statistical increase in adverse
events compared to placebo groups for new cerebral
infarction, new hemorrhagic infarction, gastrointestinal
bleeding, nausea/vomiting, or respiratory infection. The
authors also note that ebselen treatment did not contribute
to the death of any patient [21].
Daily oral gavage of ebselen in human pancreatic
tumor xenografts resulted in slower tumor growth than
vehicle controls. Ebselen appears to suppress invasion
and is not directly cytotoxic, but none-the-less affects
human pancreatic tumor cell growth in vivo as shown
in  Figure 3. While both low (160 μg/day) and high
(640  μg/day) doses of ebselen decreased tumor growth
in our xenograft model, we did not observe differences
in tumor volume between dosages. There may be no
additional benefit to treatment with higher doses of ebselen
beyond a certain threshold. Ebselen treatment did not
cause weight loss, independent of tumor size (Figure S3).
While the mechanism of decreased tumor cell growth with
ebselen treatment may be unclear, one explanation for the
decrease in tumor growth in treated mice is inhibition
of QSOX1 activity in the extracellular matrix. QSOX1
is required for incorporation of laminin α4 chains in the
ECM [7]. Its inhibition may limit the ability of tumor cells
to modify the ECM to promote tumor growth. QSOX1
also activates MMP-2 and -9, supporting the role of
QSOX1 in forming a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.

Ebselen is a heterocyclic selenoorganic compound
first identified as a glutathione peroxidase mimic and
scavenger of organic hydroperoxides [22–24]. The
intriguing enzyme-like activity of ebselen forms the basis
for its pharmacological effects [25, 26] that include potent
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [9, 27].
Ebselen covalently binds to thiols and this has emerged
as a mechanism for its activity [28]. Ebselen reacts via
reduction of the Se-N bond in the selenazole ring structure,
forming a sulfur-selenium bond with target cysteines [29].
We show that ebselen inhibits QSOX1 activity through
covalent modification of non-redox cysteines C165 and
C237 in the extant thioredoxin-2 domain.
Crystal structures of human rQSOX1 show that its
cysteines exist as disulfide pairs in the resting enzyme
except for cysteines 165 and 237 [30, 31]. How ebselen
inhibits QSOX1 through interaction with these residues is
unclear because they are not thought to participate in the
accepted disulfide relay mechanism. There is no evidence
supporting cysteines other than the redox-active C-X-X-C
motifs in the Trx1 and Erv domains as contributing to
QSOX1 activity [11, 18, 32–34]. C237 is likely protonated
and relatively inert to redox reactions since there are no
nearby basic residues to stabilize a thiolate anion [35].
The location of C165 in a predicted disordered region of
QSOX1 between the Trx1 and Trx2 domains, however,
may allow for interactions with nearby basic resides [31].
A recently described mechanism proposes that the flexible
domain architecture of QSOX1 is critical in allowing Trx1
to come into close contact with Erv to transfer electrons to
the C-X-X-C in this domain [30, 36]. Ebselen bound to
C165 and C237 may interfere with the conformational
change required for the interaction of the Trx1 and Erv
domains. Another possibility is that these cysteines
modulate the activity of QSOX1; C165 is conserved
in QSOX1 among vertebrates but not invertebrates
(Figure  S7) and may have evolved as a mechanism
to regulate QSOX1 function. Further enzymatic and
structural studies will address these hypotheses.
We have provided evidence that inhibition of QSOX1
activity by ebselen leads to significantly decreased invasion
of tumor cell lines in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vitro
and in vivo, effects comparable to QSOX1 knockdown.
Since metastasis is the cause of most cancer deaths, even
partially suppressing invasive processes through QSOX1
inhibition may help prolong survival. This study further
establishes QSOX1 as a tractable target for anti-neoplastic
drugs. Future studies will identify more potent and specific
inhibitors of QSOX1 that may decrease metastasis in vivo.

QSOX1 knockdown
Lentiviruses packaged with short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) constructs specific for human QSOX1
(sh528,  sh742) or a nonspecific scrambled sequence
(shScr) were produced in 293T cells as reported
by Katchman et al. [2]. Knockdown of QSOX1 in
MIAPaCa-2 was confirmed by western blotting using antiQSOX1 antibody (Protein Tech, Chicago, IL USA).

Nude mouse-human tumor xenograft model
Stably transduced MIAPaCa-2 cells (shScr, sh742,
and sh528) were harvested from subconfluent cultures
after brief exposure to Cell Stripper (Corning, Corning
NY). Cell suspensions were counted, washed once in
ice cold serum-free RPMI and resuspended in cold 1x
PBS. 2.4 × 107 total cells were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) according to manufacturer
specifications. Cells were kept on ice throughout the
procedure. Female athymic Foxn1nu mice (Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN USA) were injected with 1  ×  106
MIAPaCa-2 cells in Matrigel. Mice were housed in a
barrier facility on HEPA-filtered racks. All experiments
were conducted with strict adherence to aseptic technique
and IACUC regulations. Each mouse was subcutaneously
injected with 200 μl of cell suspension into the right hind
flank using a 21-gauge needle. Mice were examined every
other day to determine the volume of the tumor using
calibrated calipers. Real-time tumor volume was measured
as V = 0.5 × length × width2. When the tumors reached a
volume of 1500–2000 mm3 the mice were sacrificed and
the tumor was excised, measured and weighed.
For ebselen treatment of nude mice, three groups
were tested: 1) 20% DMSO (vehicle), 2) 160 μg/day
ebselen, and 3) 640 μg/day ebselen. 160 and 640 μg
ebselen represent an equivalent dose of 150mg and 600mg
for a 70 kg human, respectively. 1x106 MIAPaCa-2 cells
were injected subcutaneously into each mouse as before,
and tumors were allowed to grow for 3 days. Ebselen

for 28 days. Real-time tumor volume was determined
through caliper measurement of tumors over the course
of the study [37]. Error is represented as SEM. Statistical
significance was determined using two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA), comparing drug-treated with
vehicle-treated mice. Corrections for multiple comparisons
were made using Dunnett’s Test.

fluorogenic hydrogen peroxide indicator, homovanilic
acid (HVA) [8]. In this assay, 150 nM rQSOX1 was added
to 600 μM thiols from reduced DTT or RNAse A, 1 mM
HVA, 1.4 μM HRP, and 300 μM EDTA in PBS at 25oC,
pH 7.5. Assays were performed in black 96-well plates
with a final reaction volume of 150 μl. Fluorescence
signal was measured over 10 minutes at λex 320 nm
and λem 420  nm using a FlexStation spectrophotometer
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA USA). Readings were
taken in 20 second intervals after the addition of rQSOX1.
Ebselen was added to reactions at least 10 minutes prior
to the addition of rQSOX1 at concentrations ranging from
250 nM – 4 μM.
Results
for
the
HVA-based
activity
assay for rQSOX1 and ebselen are shown in
Supplementary Figure S2.

rQSOX1 expression and purification
rQSOX1 was produced and purified according
to the method of Heckler [32]. Rosetta-gami B (DE3)
cells (Novagen, Billerica MA USA) were transformed
with 50 ng pET15b containing truncated QSOX1-S. The
rQSOX1 construct contains an N-terminal poly-histidine
tag and encodes amino acids 33–546 of QSOX1-S. The
activity of the recombinant enzyme verified as described
below using a dithiothreitol (DTT) substrate [8]. The
elution profile for rQSOX1 and MALDI/LC-MS2 analysis
of trypsin-digested rQSOX are shown in Supplementary
Figures S8 and S9, respectively.

Compound
2-phenyl-1, 2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one, ebselen
(Sigma-Aldrich), was dissolved in tissue culture-grade
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO.) to a stock
concentration of 10 mM and stored at –20°C protected
from light.

rQSOX1 small molecule screen
A HTS assay was developed using reduced
denatured RNAse A substrate [38]. Hydrogen peroxide
produced in the QSOX1 reaction was detected using
ROS-Glo kit (Promega, Madison WI) as a primary
assay and HyPerBlu (Lumigen, Southfield MI) as a
secondary assay per manufacturers instructions. Assays
were optimized and reaction kinetic parameters were
determined. The assays were miniaturized to final volume
of 2 uL. HTS was also performed using the ROS-Glo
assay with a substrate concentration of 80 uM RNAse A
(that is close to Km value of 122 μM). rQSOX1 protein
was utilized at 10 nM concentration, > 20-fold over the
limit of assay detection yet still on the linear portion of
the enzyme-dependent activity. rQSOX1 was screened
against compounds from the LOPAC1280 library (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis MO USA) at 12.5 μM compound
concentration. Compounds that demonstrated > 50%
inhibition were re-tested using single-concentration in
triplicate wells, followed by concentration-dependent
confirmation in the primary and secondary QSOX1
assays. A luminescent assay for glucose oxidase (GOx)
was used as a counter-screen. The GOx assay utilized
glucose as a substrate was detected using ROS-Glo.
Active and selective compounds were purchased in dry
powder form, dissolved in DMSO and reconfirmed in the
assays before use in the confirmatory assays utilizing the
GOx counter-screen.

Growth kinetics of ebselen-treated tumor cells
1 × 104 cells/well MIAPaCa-2, BXPC3, 786-O, and
UOK1117 were plated in duplicate in 24-well plates. Cells
were adhered overnight prior to the addition of fresh media
(untreated), vehicle (0.15% DMSO), or 5 μM – 15 μM
ebselen. Cells were counted using a hemacytometer and
Trypan Blue exclusion to assess viability. Cells were
counted on days 3 and 5, and “floaters” (disadhered
and dead cells) were saved for determination of overall
viability. Media was replaced on day 3 for the 5th day
time point; floaters were saved and added back to
each well for counting on day 5. Viability was determined
as [1-(# dead cells / (# live cells + # dead cells))*100].
Error is represented as the standard error of the mean.
Significance was determined using paired T-testing for
each time point compared to vehicle-treated cells.

Trans-well invasion assays
2 × 104 MIAPaCa-2, BXPC3, 786-O, or UOK117
cells were seeded in rehydrated 24-well invasion assay
inserts containing 8 μm pores overlaid with Matrigel
(Corning) in serum-free media; cells were adhered for
1 hour prior to addition of ebselen or vehicle. Inserts
were incubated in wells containing complete media for
20 hours at 37oC. Non-invading cells were removed
with cotton swabs and membranes were fixed with
100% methanol and mounted on slides with DAPI
(Life Technologies). The total number of invading cells
was determined by manual counting of DAPI-stained
nuclei.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry

Cyanylation and ammonia-based cleavage
at free cysteines

2 μM rQSOX1 was incubated with 20 μM ebselen
(10-fold excess) with or without 10 μM DTT substrate
(added 5 minutes prior to mass analysis). rQSOX1 was
analyzed intact by liquid chromatography-electrospray
ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) on a Dionex
Ultimate 3000 HPLC equipped with a 1:100 flow splitter
connected to a Bruker Maxis 4G quadrupole-time-offlight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer. A trap-and-elute
form of LC-MS was carried out in which 15 µL samples
were loaded at 10 μl/min in 80/20 water/acetonitrile
containing 0.1% formic acid (loading solvent)
onto  a  Bruker-Michrom protein captrap conFigured
for bi-directional flow on a 6-port diverter valve. The
trap was then rinsed with the HPLC loading pump at
10 µl/min for 40 min to completely remove PBS buffer
salts. The flow over the captrap was then switched
to the micropump, set at 2 µL/min, and ramped over
5 minutes from 80% water containing 0.1% formic
acid (Solvent A)/20% acetonitrile (Solvent B) to 90%
acetonitrile and held for 3 min.
The captrap eluent was directed to the mass
spectrometer operating in positive ion, TOF-only mode,
acquiring spectra in the m/z range of 300 to 3000 with
a nominal resolving power of ~60, 000 m/ßm FWHM.
ESI settings for the Agilent G1385A capillary microflow
nebulizer ion source were as follows: End plate offset
–500 V, capillary –3500 V, nebulizer nitrogen 2 bar, dry
gas nitrogen 3.0 L/min at 225°C. Data were acquired in
profile mode at a digitizer sampling rate of 4 GHz. Spectra
rate control was by summation at 1 Hz.
rQSOX1 eluted over a period of about 1 minute;
under the above conditions, rQSOX1 ranged in charge
state from +32 to +60. Raw mass spectra were averaged
across this timeframe, baseline subtracted and charge
deconvoluted with Bruker DataAnalysis 4.1 charge
deconvolution software to a mass range of 1000 Da on
either side of any identified peak.

Free cysteines on rQSOX1 were identified by
treatment of recombinant enzyme with the sulfhydryl
cyanylating reagent 1-Cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium
tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) followed by ammonia-mediated
N-terminal cleavage and analysis by MALDI-MS
[39]. 100 pmol rQSOX1 was dissolved in 0.1 M citrate
containing 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 3.0. CDAP was added
to a concentration of 25 mM from a freshly prepared
200 mM stock and incubated for 15 minutes at 25oC.
Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to a concentration
of 0.2%, and protein was purified using C18 ZipTips
(Millipore); purified rQSOX1 was eluted with 90% ACN
with 0.1% TFA in MilliQ H2O. Samples were dried and
reconstituted in 6 M guanidine-HCl containing 1 M
NH4OH, pH 11.5. Samples were incubated for 60 minutes
at 37oC. Reactions were quenched by reducing the pH
to 3.0 with citric acid. Disulfide bonds were reduced in
100 mM TCEP dissolved in ddH2O for 30 minutes at
37oC. 0.2% TFA was added, and C18 ZipTip purification
was repeated as before. Samples were eluted with 3 ul
90% ACN/0.1% TFA directly onto MALDI targets; 2 μl
saturated sinapinic acid in 33% ACN/0.4% TFA was added
and samples air-dried.

MALDI mass spectrometry
Masses of cyanylation/ammonia-induced protein
cleavage products of rQSOX1 were determined by
MALDI-MS on a Bruker Ultraflex-III MALDI mass
spectrometer equipped with a Nd:YAG laser operating
in positive-ion, delayed extraction linear mode, with ion
source 1 at 25.00 kV, ion source 2 at 23.10 kV, lens at
7.50 kV, 150 ns delay, and 1 GS/s sample rate. Prior to
acquisition of the mass spectra, the target mass range was
externally calibrated using a mixture of calibrants obtained
from Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA USA).

Maleimide protection assay

Acknowledgments

2 μM rQSOX1 in 1X PBS (pH 7.5) was incubated
with a 5-fold molar excess of ebselen or vehicle
for  5  minutes at 25oC. AlexaFluor488-C5-maleimide
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA) was added to a final
concentration of 100 μM. Reactions were incubated for
30 minutes at 37oC, protected from light. Protein from
each reaction was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels
in non-reducing conditions. Gels were washed twice for
5  minutes in ddH2O and imaged under UV light. Gels
were then stained with Coomassie R-250 for 15 minutes.
Band  intensities were analyzed by ImageJ, and are
represented as “percent signal” of rQSOX1 pre-incubated
with vehicle.
