ABSTRACT
Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a rare autosomal dominant
disorder that is due, in large measure, to aberrant Shh signaling driven by mutations
in the tumor suppressor gene Ptch1. Here, we describe the development of Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice as a novel model of this disease. These animals manifest many features
of NBCCS, including developmental anomalies and are remarkably sensitive to both
ultraviolet (UVB) and ionizing radiation that drive the development of multiple BCCs.
Just as in patients with NBCCS, Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 also spontaneously develops BCCs
and other neoplasms such as rhabdomyomas/rhabdomyosarcomas. Administration
of smoothened inhibitors (vismodegib/itraconazole/cyclopamine) or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (sulindac/sulfasalazine) each result in partial resolution of
BCCs in these animals. However, combined administration of these agents inhibits the
growth of UVB-induced BCCs by >90%. Employing small molecule- and decoy-peptidebased approaches we further affirm that complete remission of BCCs could only be
achieved by combined inhibition of p50-NFκB/Bcl3 and Shh signaling. We posit that
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice are a novel and relevant animal model for NBCCS. Understanding
mechanisms that govern genetic predisposition to BCCs should facilitate our ability
to identify and treat NBCCS gene carriers, including those at risk for sporadic BCCs
while accelerating development of novel therapeutic modalities for these patients.

TT transitions at pyrimidine-pyrimidine sequences as
well as the formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts [4, 5]. Highly efficient DNA damage repair
mechanisms play an important role in correcting these
structural mutations thereby diminishing the risk of
tumor development [4]. These mutations are detectable
in several tumor suppressor genes particularly Patched
1 (Ptch1) and p53 in sun-exposed skin sites [4–6].
Importantly, 50–80% of sporadic BCCs from both DNA

INTRODUCTION
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSCs) including
basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCs) are the most common types of human
malignancy [1]. Tumor susceptibility directly correlates
with repeated skin exposure to mutagenic solar UVB or
environmental chemical carcinogens [2, 3]. UVB induces
signature mutations characterized by C to T or CC to

repair-proficient [4, 5] as well as DNA repair-deficient
patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum manifest point
mutations in both the Ptch1 and p53 genes [7, 8].
Significantly, the characteristic Ptch1 and p53 mutations
that occur in sporadic human BCCs are also present in
BCCs excised from patients with dominantly inherited
Gorlin syndrome also known as nevoid basal cell
carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) [9, 10]. It is now wellestablished that aberrant sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling
is central to the growth of both sporadic BCCs and those
that develop in patients with NBCCS.
NBCCS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder in
which affected individuals carry a germline mutation
in the Ptch1 gene [11–14]. These patients develop large
numbers of BCCs often in the first decade of life as well
as medulloblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS)
[11, 15]. In addition, they are susceptible to numerous
benign growths such as epidermal cysts, hair follicle
tumors, odontogenic jaw cysts, ovarian cysts as well as
characteristic palmar and plantar pits [11, 16, 17]. Multiple
skeletal defects also occur including polydactyly, bifid
ribs and sprengel deformity. Central nervous system
abnormalities may include calcification of the falx cerebri
and agenesis of the corpus callosum [18]. Craniofacial
abnormalities include frontal bossing and ocular
hypertelorism [18].
Family-based linkage studies in affected kindreds
led to the identification of the underlying mutation in
the Ptch1 gene, a 9q23 microdeletion on the long arm of
chromosome 9 [19]. Initially it was thought that mutant
Ptch1-based activation of hedgehog (hh) signaling was the
sole and pivotal abnormality involved in the pathogenesis
of this syndrome [3, 6, 9]. Ptch1 functions as a receptor
for hh ligands including Shh, desert (Dhh) and Indian
hedgehog (Ihh). Hh is highly conserved and functions as a
segmentation polarity gene [6, 20]. During embryogenesis
intermittent Hh signaling is a fundamental signal
transduction pathway directing the morphogenesis of vital
body structures. At birth this pathway is largely silenced
throughout adult life [20, 21].
Several animal models of BCCs have been
developed based on the identification of Shh signaling
abnormalities in these neoplasms [6, 9, 22]. Initial efforts
to develop such models focused on Ptch1 null mice which
proved to be embryonic lethal. By deleting exons 1 and 2,
heterozygous knockout-mice (Ptch1+/−) were developed on
a C57/BL6 background [23]. Although the skin of these
mice appears grossly normal, biopsies show histologic
evidence of microscopic basaloid cell proliferation that
closely resembles the pattern seen in human BCCs. Skin
exposure of Ptch1+/− mice to UVB or to ionizing radiation
(IR) induces the growth of microscopic and a few
macroscopic BCCs in a pattern more typical of sporadic
human BCCs [24–27]. These animals do not manifest the
severity of skin involvement that occurs in patients with
NBCCS.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since, the phenotypic features of patients with
NBCCS may vary depending upon their ethnic origin
[13, 14, 28], we asked whether crossing of Ptch1
heterozygosity into a highly tumor-susceptible genetic
background could yield a mouse model that more closely
duplicates the NBCCS phenotype. SKH-1 hairless mice
have been used for decades as an excellent animal model
to study UVB-induced SCCs [29, 30], yet they rarely if
ever develop BCCs. Because of the utility of the SKH-1
mouse as a model for UVB-induced SCCs we posited that
transfer of Ptch1+/− heterozygosity in C57BL/6 mice onto
the SKH-1 background might provide a novel, relevant
and more convenient murine model for studying the
pathogenesis of BCCs. Importantly, Ptch1+/−/C57BL/6
mice or mice of mixed genetic backgrounds rarely develop
spontaneous BCCs [25, 27].
In this study, we show that the growth of both
spontaneous and UVB-induced BCCs is accelerated in
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice and that these animals manifest
many of the phenotypic abnormalities observed in patients
with NBCCS. In addition, similar to NBCCS patients,
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice are exquisitely sensitive to IR and
develop large numbers of BCCs on both their dorsal and
ventral skin following exposure to a single dose of 5
Gy. Of further interest in the process of reviewing skin
biopsies obtained to assess tumor development in the
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice we found histologic evidence for
a substantially increased pro-inflammatory response, a
recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of cutaneous
cancers. A significant reduction but not complete
abrogation of the growth of BCCs occurs in mice treated
with inhibitors of a component of the Shh pathway known
as smoothened (SMO) including Erivedge (vismodegib)
or Sporanox (itraconazole). Following activation of Shh
signaling, SMO is translocated to the tip of the primary
cilium, an essential step for driving cell proliferation [31].
This process is inhibited by these drugs thereby blocking
Shh signaling both in murine BCCs and in patients with
NBCCS [32–35].
In our quest to identify more efficacious
mechanism-driven targeted therapy for the multiple
BCCs that occur in patients with NBCCS, we have found
that pharmacologic inhibition of Shh and inflammatory
signaling pathways using combined administration
of inhibitors of these signaling pathways leads to
almost complete abrogation of BCC growth. The proinflammatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of
BCCs includes enhanced expression of cyclo-oxygenase 2
(COX-2), and the non-canonical nuclear factor kappa B
(NFκB) signaling pathway regulated by the p50 and Bcl3
heterodimer. Combinatorial inhibition of these signaling
pathways together with Smo inhibition led to synergistic
regression of BCCs. Our data show that Ptch1+/−/SKH-1
mice represent a novel and uniquely relevant model for
investigating disease pathogenesis in patients with
NBCCS and that maximum abrogation of BCCs requires

combined inhibition of Shh and NFkB signaling in these
“NBCCS-like” mice. It is our belief that this novel murine
model of NBCCS provides unique opportunities for
adding to current knowledge regarding the mechanisms
that govern genetic predisposition to non-melanoma skin
cancer and may also enhance our ability to accelerate
development of novel agents for the prevention and
treatment of human populations susceptible to BCCs the
most common type of human malignancy.

with NBCCS (Figure 1A, lower panel and Supplemental
Figure S2B and S2C). None of these spontaneous tumors
grew in littermates carrying the wild-type Ptch1 gene (data
not shown). Spontaneous tumor growth in the Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 animals was age-dependent, and usually occurred
beyond 18 weeks of age when visible macroscopic BCCs
begin to appear (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure
S2D). By 40–50 weeks of age, nearly half the animals
were found to have at least one spontaneous visible BCC
(Supplemental Figure S2C). More impressive was the agedependent increase in the number and size of microscopic
BCC-like lesions (Supplemental Figure S2D). Between
week 8 and week 52 of age there was on average a 4–6-fold
increase in microscopic BCCs (Figure 1B). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first murine model manifesting
such a high incidence of spontaneous BCCs during the
first year of life. Moreover in earlier described murine
models, spontaneous BCCs occurred very late in life with
a prevalence of less than 10% [6, 27]. In this regard, the
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mouse more closely mimics patients with
NBCCS who often develop BCCs in the first decade of life
after which the rate of tumor growth typically increases
with age [6, 9, 36].

RESULTS
Development and characterization of NBCCS
murine model
C57BL/6 mice are generally regarded as
tumor-resistant, whereas the SKH-1 mouse offers
a tumor-susceptible genetic background for studies
of UVB-induced skin photocarcinogenesis [29, 30].
Because of this enhanced skin tumor susceptibility,
SKH-1 mice have been extensively used for decades
to investigate the pathogenesis of UVB-induced SCCs.
They develop numerous SCCs following chronic
exposure to UVB in a pattern analogous to that of
patients with sequential growth of multiple benign premalignant lesions (papillomas) some of which progress
to malignant SCCs [30]. However, these mice do not
develop BCCs either spontaneously or following chronic
UVB irradiation and indeed until recently there was
really no useful animal model available for the study of
BCCs. Our laboratory has been attempting to develop a
mouse model with enhanced susceptibility to cutaneous
BCCs. Our strategy employed crossing Ptch1+/−/
C57BL/6 mice with SKH-1 hairless mice (Supplemental
Figure S1A). Animals employed in these studies have
been bred for more than 25 generations (Supplemental
Figure S1A and S1B). Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice
develop spontaneous BCCs, that appear in areas near the
nose, tail and/or randomly on various areas of the dorsal
or ventral skin (Figure 1A, upper panel). In contrast,
spontaneous development of SCCs in parental SKH-1
or in the Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice is decidedly
uncommon. Significantly, Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice
also manifest rhabdomyomas/rhabdomyosarcomas that
generally appeared subcutaneously, predominantly
over the hind limbs (Figure 1A, lower panel). These
tumors also occur in patients with NBCCS [15] further
attesting to the close resemblance of this mouse model
to the human disease. In addition, a few of these animals
manifest other phenotypic features of NBCCS including
polydactyly, craniofacial abnormalties and odontogenic
keratocyst(s) (Supplemental Figure S2A).
Histopathologic examination of skin tumors in our
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 animals revealed interfollicular basaloid
cell proliferation in patterns virtually indistinguishable
from human BCCs, and trichoblastomas typical of patients

UVB-induced carcinogenesis in Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice
The detailed tumor development profile following
chronic UVB-irradiation of genetically homogeneous
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice (25th generation) is shown in
Figure 1C. Initial tumors are visible after 14–16 weeks of
UVB irradiation (Figure 1C). By week 20, approximately
60% of the animals develop tumors and by week 26, 100%
of the mice have at least one tumor (Figure 1C, left panel).
By week 30, each mouse had on average, 10.3 ± 1.51
tumors (Figure 1C, middle left panel) of which 1.85 ± 0.39
were BCCs (Figure 1C, right panel). However by week
30, 20% or less of the age-matched control non-irradiated
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice had developed spontaneous BCCs
(0.25 ± 0.12 tumor/mouse). These tumors were also
smaller as compared with UVB-induced BCCs (9.5 ±
8.8 vs 312.8 ± 87.8 mm3/mouse) (Figure 1C, middle
right panel). Immunohistochemical studies of BCCs
showed interfollicular basaloid proliferation with strong
positive staining for β-galactosidase (β-gal), Gli1, and
Hhip (Supplemental Figure S3). To further document the
proliferative properties of these BCCs, we immunostained
tumor tissue with an antibody specific for keratin-17,
an outer root sheath marker protein [37] (Supplemental
Figure S3). Keratin-17 expression was consistently
increased in these tumors just as it is in human BCCs
and those that develop in Gli2 transgenic mice [38, 39].
In addition, upregulation of cyclins D1/D2/D3 and E and
augmented expression of Shh signaling-related genes were
noted not only in BCCs but also in the tumor-adjacent
hyperplastic epidermis (Supplemental Figure S4A).

of both BCCs and SCCs (Figure 1D, left panel). Indeed
these tumors in our mice were highly invasive. Insofar as
we are aware no other mouse models have been shown to
develop this type of tumor.
Not surprisingly given their SKH-1 background,
the chronically UVB-irradiated Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice

also developed squamous papillomas and SCCs. Some of
these lesions were poorly differentiated invasive SCCs
showing dermal involvement while simultaneously
showing signs of squamous differentiation as evidenced
by the presence of multiple keratin pearls. These
keratotic squamous lesions also resembled invasive
keratoacanthomas (Supplemental Figure S4B) and
showed dense inflammatory cell infiltrates particularly in
the tumor stroma. There were differences in the pattern

Comparison of identical UVB-induced SCC-like lesions
in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 and Ptch1+/+/SKH-1 mice (Figure 2C)
revealed that the tumors induced in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1
mice were more aggressive and showed conversion of
highly polarized epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like
spindle structures infiltrating into the dermis. As shown
in Supplemental Figure S4B, these tumor infiltrates were
also associated with inflammatory hematopoietic cells.

Next we attempted to characterize the tumor
microenvironment in the skin and BCCs of Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice by profiling baseline and UVB-induced
expression of cytokines, chemokines; inflammatory cell
infiltration; pro-inflammatory signaling; and responses to
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

skin, the underlying dermis of BCCs was rich in
macrophages, neutrophils and bone marrow-derived
GR-1+/CD11b+ myeloid cells, also known as myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC). T helper cells (Th)
and regulatory T cells (Treg) were also seen as shown
in Figure  6A, second panel. Exaggerated neutrophil
infiltration in tumor-adjacent skin was also confirmed
by markedly enhanced detection of neutrophil-derived
myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Figure 6B). Prior studies have
shown that MDSCs infiltrate the stroma of skin tumors
[37, 46, 47]. In addition the presence of these cells in
the tumor microenvironment of BCCs has recently been
described by Fan et al who showed that CCL2/CCR2 are
involved in the migration of these cells [48]. Our results
also indicate an increase of CCR2 in tumor-adjacent
skin. Similarly, in the skin of patients with NBCCS,
microscopic basal cell lesions were found to be associated
with infiltration of hematopoietic cells positive for CD11b/
CD16 and CD11c/CD4 that characterize monocytes,
macrophages, neutrophils, granulocytes, and natural killer
cells as shown in Figure 2E.
To further characterize the tumor microenvironment,
we investigated the status of effector pro-inflammatory
signaling pathways in the tumor-adjacent skin and BCCs in
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice. Earlier, we showed high expression
of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the stroma and tumor
islands of human and murine BCCs [49]. Confirming
these observations, enhanced COX-2 expression and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) also characterized
these lesions. Additionally, consistent with previous
observations showing association of MAP kinase activity
with UVB-induced cutaneous inflammatory responses
[50], here, we also found enhanced phosphorylation of
the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
proteins Erk1/2 and p38 in tumor-associated tissue
(Figure 6D).
Finally, we attempted to verify the role of
eicosanoids in driving tissue inflammation in BCCs by
assessing the effect of administering the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac (SUL).
SUL treatment substantially reduced tumor-associated
inflammation as confirmed by diminished infiltration of
hematopoietic cells, reduced expression of iNOS, p-Erk1/2
and p-p38 in the tumor stroma (Figure 6D).

expression of 84 key genes known to mediate
inflammatory responses. These inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines are reported as secretory molecules which
augment recruitment of innate immune cells including
macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells, and natural
killer cells as well as adaptive immune cells (T and B
lymphocytes) into the tumor microenvironment [40, 41].
We observed that baseline expression of 49 of
84 genes was higher, 19 were lower and 16 remained
unaltered in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 murine skin as compared
to Ptch1+/+/SKH-1 animals (Figure 2A). Among these,
chemokines (Ccl11, Ccl22, Ccl3, Ccl5, Ccl6, Ccl8, Ccl9,
Cxcl13 and Tgfb1), chemokine receptors (Ccr2, Ccr3,
Ccr7, Ccr8, Ccr10 and Cxcr3), interleukins (IL) (10, 11,
12b and 16), interleukin receptors IlRa (10 and 5) and other
cytokines such as Pf4, Ifng, Cd40lg, Lta, Ltb and Tnfrsf1b
were up-regulated more than 2-fold. Approximately a 50%
reduction in the expression of chemokines (Ccl17, Ccl20,
Ccl25 and Cxcl1 and ILs (18, 1a, 1b, 1f6 and 20), and
cytokine Aimp1 was seen (Figure 2A and Supplemental
Figure S5A).
The inflammatory response in skin excised from
chronically UVB-irradiated Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice showed
that expression of 36 genes was enhanced, 24 genes downregulated and the remaining 24 genes were unchanged
(Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure S5B).
Treatment of chronically UVB-irradiated Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice with the classic SMO inhibitor cyclopamine
(20 mg/kg body weight; twice a week), partially attenuated
these UVB-induced gene expression patterns (Figure 2B
and Supplemental Figure S5B). Only 17 of 84 genes in this
panel reverted to baseline. Interestingly, Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccr3,
Cxcl1, Pf4, Cxcl5, Il11, Il13, Il17b, Il1a and Il4 that had
been altered by the introduction of Ptch1 heterozygosity
were attenuated by cyclopamine treatment. However,
the expressions of the majority of genes altered by UVB
irradiation were substantially unresponsive to cyclopamine
treatment. These data suggest that inflammatory signatures
induced by activated Shh signaling and UVB are distinct
and respond differentially to Shh pathway inhibitors.
In this regard, Shh signaling has been implicated in the
development of inflammatory responses in intestine and
brain [42, 43]. Recently, Shh signaling has also been
shown to be regulated by NFκB [44]. To our knowledge
this is the first evidence that upregulation of Shh signaling
contributes to a pro-inflammatory microenvironment
in murine skin. It is of interest that Gorlin in an early
publication had commented on the increased cutaneous
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in lesions from patients
with NBCCS [45].
Next, we characterized the pro-inflammatory
infiltrating hematopoietic cells in the BCC tumor
microenvironment using immunofluorescence staining
of various surface marker proteins that stain for these
inflammatory cells. Compared to age-matched control

Both spontaneous and UVB-induced BCCs in
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice carry point mutations in
Ptch1 gene
To better understand the pathogenesis of the
spontaneous BCCs in our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice, we
analyzed mutations in the tumor suppressor genes Ptch1
and p53. Humans with NBCCS inherit a germline mutation
in one allele of the Ptch1 gene and tumor development is
generally accompanied by loss of the remaining wild-type
allele leading to aberrant activation of Shh signaling that

drives the growth of these lesions [9, 11, 12, 16]. Here,
we detected multiple Ptch1 mutations in spontaneous
BCCs from Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice (Supplemental
Figure S6) which were similar to those known to occur
in NBCCS patients [51]. However, we could not detect
any mutations in the p53 DNA binding region of these
spontaneous BCCs. In contrast, UVB-induced BCCs did
manifest UVB-signature p53 mutations in addition to
mutations in Ptch1 (data not shown).

including cyclin D1 and PCNA along with elevated
anti-apoptotic Bcl2 (Figure 3E). There was also elevated
mRNA expression of Shh-signaling pathway genes Gli1,
Gli2, Gli3 and Ptch1/2 in both tumor-adjacent skin and
BCCs of IR-irradiated mice (Figure 3F). In general,
increased expression of cyclins D1, D2, D3 and E was
detectable in these tumors at the protein and mRNA levels
(Figure 3F). By contrast, Ptch1+/− mice in C57BL/6 or
mixed genetic backgrounds when exposed to an identical
single dose of IR developed no more than 1 to 3 BCCs/
mouse during their lifetime [24].

Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice are highly sensitive to IR

Smo inhibitors incompletely inhibit BCC growth
in chronically UVB-irradiated Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice

Patients with NBCCS are known to be exquisitely
sensitive to IR. In the past, NBCCS patients with
childhood medulloblastomas were treated with IR and
later in life often developed large numbers of BCCs
in irradiated skin sites [52]. To demonstrate the close
resemblance of Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice with NBCCS
patients, we irradiated these animals with a single dose
of IR (5 Gy). Similar to patients with NBCCS, these
animals developed multiple BCCs over the dorsal and
ventral skin surface starting from week 10 (Figure 3A). By
week 19 virtually all of the animals had developed large
numbers of tumors, (approximately 70–80 tumors/mouse)
(Figure 3B) accounting for a total tumor volume exceeding
3500 mm3 (Figure 3C). Histological examination showed
sheets of microscopic BCCs spread throughout the dermis.
(Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure S7A and S7B). The
majority of these BCCs exceeded 4–5 mm in diameter
showing increased expression of proliferation markers

Cyclopamine is a naturally occurring Smo
antagonist [53, 54]. In prior studies, we initially showed
that chronic oral administration of cyclopamine reduces
UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/−/C57BL/6 mice or
in Ptch1+/− mice of mixed genetic background [54].
Thereafter, Genentech developed an analog of cyclopamine
known as vismodegib (GDC-0449 or Erivedge). This
drug is a more potent Smo inhibitor and binds to Smo at
a site identical to that of cyclopamine [32, 33, 55, 56].
To test the potency of vismodegib in blocking growth of
BCCs in our murine model of NBCCS, we administered
vismodegib (40 mg/kg body weight by mouth) to Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice thirty minutes prior to each exposure to UVB
and assessed its protective effects against UVB-induced

macroscopic and microscopic BCCs in these animals.
Vismodegib attenuated development of UVB-induced
macroscopic BCCs by 73% (p = 0.001) and tumor volume
by 76% (p  = 0.004) (Figure 4A and 4B). Consistently,

were accompanied by diminished PCNA expression and
enhanced numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells

(Figure 4D). Interestingly, tumor stromal cells were also
frequently TUNEL-positive (Figure 4D, lower right
panel). These data demonstrate that vismodegib is a potent
but incomplete inhibitor of the growth of BCCs in Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice. We next compared the inhibitory effect on
Shh-signaling and the anti-tumor efficacy of vismodegib
cyclopamine and ITRA, by analyzing samples from
various treatment groups with qPCR for the expression
of Shh signaling genes as shown in Figure 4E. Chronic

treatment with these agents for 30 weeks diminished Shh
signaling by an average of 80, 60 and 47%, respectively by
vismodegib, ITRA and cyclopamine However, differences
in their ability to inhibit BCC growth (both microscopic
and macroscopic) were subtle (60–70%) and did not
correlate with their inhibitory effect on Shh pathway genes
(Figure 4E).

BCCs were reduced by 67% (ITRA alone), 58% (SUL
alone and 72% (combined ITRA and SUL) (Figure 5C,
upper panel). Similar results were seen with microscopic
BCCs as well (Figure 5C, middle and lower panel). ITRA
alone and SUL alone decreased expression of biomarkers
of cell proliferation (PCNA and cyclin D1), and increased
expression of pro-apoptotic biomarkers (Bax) in BCCs
and the combined ITRA and SUL regimen was again more
effective in this regard (Figure 5D).
We also used a similar approach to assess the
tumor-associated inflammatory response during tumor
development. Compared to treatment with ITRA and
SUL alone, the combination was again more effective
in reducing the inflammatory response. As shown in
Figure 6A and Supplemental Figure S8A and S8B,
GR-1/CD11b-myeloid cells, CD4, MHCII, FOXP3 and
vitamin D  receptor (VDR)-positive Treg cells were
diminished in the tumor microenvironment surrounding
microscopic BCCs. The number of infiltrating
neutrophils as reflected by MPO enzyme activity
was also significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in animals
receiving the combination (Figure 6B). These changes
in the inflammatory cell infiltrate were accompanied by
a striking reduction in the phosphorylation-dependent
activation of Erk1/2 and p38 MAPKs, and diminished
iNOS expression (Figure  6D and Supplemental
Figure S9). These signaling proteins are known to
be expressed in cutaneous inflammation including
that induced by UVB as described earlier [50]. SULmediated reduction in inflammatory response was also
accompanied by significant decrease in Gli1. Gli2 and
Ptch1 but not Ptch2 showed some decrease whereas
combination of ITRA+SUL was much more effective
in this regard (Figure 6C). Based on the enhanced antitumor efficacy of the combined regimen in our mouse
model we anticipate conducting a clinical trial using this
approach in our cohort of NBCCS patients.

Combined administration of inhibitors of Shh
signaling and NSAIDs substantially abrogates
the growth of UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/−/
SKH-1 mice
Our group has recently participated in a placebocontrolled randomized clinical trial in patients with
NBCCS showing that orally administered vismodegib
substantially reduces BCC burden in slightly more
than half (56%) of these patients. Unfortunately these
anti-tumor effects were largely reversible following
discontinuation of drug administration [57, 58]. Our
results show that vismodegib partially eliminates UVBinduced BCCs in our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice (Figure 4). SUL
was also only partially effective in this regard confirming
our earlier observations with the specific COX-2 inhibitor,
celecoxib which showed partial efficacy both in a murine
model of sporadic BCCs and in patients with NBCCS
[59]. Recently, ITRA, an FDA-approved azole antifungal
drug, was shown to be a potent SMO inhibitor with an
IC50 of approximately 800 nM in the Shh-Light2 reporter
cell line [34]. ITRA is an oral antifungal agent commonly
used in clinical practice that is administered over a period
of months [34]. ITRA binds to Smo at a site distinct from
that of cyclopamine or cyclopamine analogs [60] and also
manifests potent activity against the vismodegib resistant
SMO mutant, human SMOD473H/ murine SMOD477G [32,
61]. In this study, we assessed the ability of combining
orally administered ITRA (40 mg/kg body weight) and
SUL (80 mg/kg body weight) on the growth of BCCs in
our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice. To further facilitate the data
interpretation, we have utilized various control groups
including age-matched non-drug non-irradiated, UVBirradiated alone, ITRA treated alone+UVB irradiated
and SUL-treated alone+UVB-irradiated. In these
experiments, the combination of ITRA and SUL almost
completely eliminated UVB-induced growth of BCCs.
Tumor volumes were reduced by 50% (ITRA alone),
63% (SUL alone) and 90% (ITRA and SUL combined
(Figure 5A). The combined regimen diminished UVBinduced BCCs by 92% from 1.8 ± 0.38 to 0.13 ± 0.09
BCCs/mouse as compared to single treatment (ITRA,
0.8 ± 0.22 BCCs/mouse; SUL, 0.9 ± 0.31 BCCs/mouse)
(Figure 5B). Histological and immunohistological analysis
of these tumors confirmed the superior efficacy of the
combined ITRA and SUL regimen and showed reduced
staining for proliferation markers and increased numbers
of TUNEL-positive cells (data not shown). Microscopic

NFκB signaling pathway influences the
pathogenesis of inflammatory responses
associated with the growth of BCCs
To define the mechanism whereby cutaneous
inflammation accelerates the growth of BCCs, we tested
whether crosstalk between the NFκB and Shh signaling
pathways might be involved. NFκB-dependent signaling
is known to mediate inflammatory responses during
progression of neoplasia [62]. Crosstalk between these
two pathways has been postulated to contribute to the
pathogenesis of various epithelial tumors [63–67]. As
an initial approach, we assessed NFκB transcriptional
activity in human and murine BCCs. Using electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found that NFκB was
consistently up-regulated in both murine and human BCCs
(Figure 7A). However, supershift assays detected only the
p50 subunit of NFκB in these tumors. These effects were

consistently seen in spontaneous BCCs and in IR or UVB
induced BCCs (Figure 7B). In human BCCs, the upstream
kinase, IKKα/β, and downstream target genes, Bcl2,
TRAIL and IL1β were all upregulated. Inhibitory kappa B
α (IκBα) was decreased whereas its phosphorylated form
was increased (Figure 7A). In canonical NFκB pathway,
phosphorylation of IκBα is required for its dissociation
from the cytosolic transcriptionally inactive heterotrimeric
NFkB complex, which then migrates to the nucleus as a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcriptionally active heterodimeric protein complex as
shown in Figure 11.
It is known that the p50 subunit of NFκB lacks a
DNA transactivating domain [68]. However in considering
the role of a non-canonical pathway, it could acquire
transcriptional activity by engaging another partner protein
known as Bcl3, an atypical member of the IκB family
[69]. Bcl3 is known to associate with nuclear p50 or p52
homodimers and modulate transcription [69]. We utilized

immunofluorescence techniques to determine whether p50/
Bcl3 and p52/Bcl3 complexes are present in murine and
human BCCs. Co-localization signals (Figure 7C and data
not shown) were detected for p50/Bcl3 nuclear complexes in
BCCs obtained from patients with NBCCS as well as in our
mouse model. However, in a small subset of human BCC
cells, nuclear staining for p65 was also positive (data not
shown). This confirms the results of western blot analysis
of nuclear extracts prepared from these human BCCs, which
also showed a signal for p65 (Supplemental Figure S10A).

These data support the concept that in murine BCCs, Bcl3protein complexes primarily regulate transcriptional activity
whereas in human BCCs both Bcl3 and p65 complexes with
p50 or p52 regulate transcriptional activity.
Bcl3 expression is influenced by multiple factors
[69–71]. These include cylindromatous (cyld) protein and/
or the Th2 tumor microenvironment as shown by the Flow
Diagram in Figure 7F. We found that cyld which regulates

human BCCs [72], the tumor stroma of murine BCCs
show characteristic features of a Th2 microenvironment
including increased expression of IL4 and the presence
of cells expressing CD4/FOXP3 (Figure  6A and
Supplemental Figure S8A & S8B and S10B). Th2
cytokines are known to up-regulate Bcl3 expression in
murine skin [73].
To demonstrate that crosstalk between p50-Bcl3
and Shh signaling underlies the pathogenesis of BCCs in
NBCCS, we employed multiple approaches as shown in
Figure 8. First, we treated murine BCC ASZ cells with
Shh inhibitors cyclopamine and GANT61 as shown in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure 8A. While cyclopamine inhibits Shh signaling by
binding with Smo, GANT61 inhibits its downstream target
transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 [54, 74]. Treatment
with both of these agents significantly diminished
nuclear Bcl3-positive cells. Next, we assessed Bcl3
expression in tumors obtained from vismodegib, ITRA
and cyclopamine-treated animals. Decreased expression
of p50-Bcl3 and -dependent transcription-associated
targets such as cyclin D1 and N-cadherin were observed
(Figure  8A). Finally, we investigated whether shRNAbased Bcl3 knock-down diminishes Shh signaling
(Figure 8B, 8C and 8D and Supplemental Figure S11).

As shown in Figure 8E and 8F, the isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-mediated shRNA-targeting
of Bcl3 in ASZ001 cells reduced colony numbers and sizes
in a colony forming assay. Combining Bcl3 knock-down
with cyclopamine treatment, colony size and number
were reduced to <5% of scrambled RNA transfected cells.
Similarly, we observed substantially reduced expression of
Gli1/2 and Ptch1 in Bcl3 knock-down BCC ASZ001 cells
(Figure 8C) confirming the existence of crosstalk between
these two pathways.

As we could not identify a small molecule that
could specifically block p50/Bcl3 signaling, we employed
sulfasalazine (SSZ), an inhibitor of upstream IKKα/β
[75]. SSZ is also an FDA-approved drug for the treatment
of psoriatic arthritis [76, 77]. Treatment with SSZ alone
and in combination with cyclopamine diminished the
growth of UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice.
Both BCC numbers and volumes were significantly
reduced (Figures 9A, 9B and 9C). This reduction in

and diminished cell cycle regulatory cyclinD1/2 and
the partner kinases CDK4/6 and reduced proliferative
signaling as assessed by PCNA expression (Figure  9D
and Supplemental Figure S12). In this case also, we
observed that combining SSZ+cyclopamine was much
more effective (p < 0.001) than either alone. Interestingly,

we further confirmed that Shh and NFκB pathways
manifest crosstalk as SSZ partially reduced Shh signaling
(Figure 9E) whereas cyclopamine treatment reduced
nuclear Bcl3 and dependent signaling (Figure 9G and
Supplemental Figure S13B), while a combination of the
two almost completely abrogated the activation of both of
these pathways (Figure 9E and 9G, second panel).

To further strengthen the role of the p50/Bcl3
transcriptional pathway in the pathogenesis of BCCs, we
injected a p50 decoy peptide (DP) or a control peptide
(CP) directly into macroscopic BCCs once daily for two
weeks. The DP contained a protein transduction domain
(PTD) antennapedia sequence that allowed it to penetrate
the plasma membrane as well as a nuclear localization
sequence (NLS) [78]. The CP contained only the PTD
antennapedia sequence (Figure 10A). We observed that
DP-injected tumors showed enhanced growth arrest as
compared to tumors injected with CP (Figure 10B). To
determine whether SMO inhibition combined with NFκB

inhibition is more effective in inhibiting tumor growth, we
performed an identical experiment in mice treated with
cyclopamine (Figure 10C). Indeed cyclopamine-treatedanimals were more responsive to the growth inhibitory
effects of DP (Figure 10C), and manifested enhanced
tumor regression. Consistently, in both experiments, we
found that DP treatment blocked the nuclear localization
of Bcl3 and p50/Bcl3-dependent transcriptional activity.
Thus, the downstream targets of Bcl3, including cyclin
D1 and N-cadherin were substantially decreased in
the shrinking lesions (Figure  8E). Again, here also
we confirmed the crosstalk of Bcl3/Shh signaling

(yellow) for the co-localization of Bcl3/p50 in CP-treated control panel whereas DP-treated tumors show nuclear staining for these proteins.
Simple linear regression for the analysis of the differences between the two treatment groups was used. The outcome is the averaged value
of the tumor decrease percentage compared with day 0 for different tumors. We considered the treatment effect and the time variable as the
covariates in our regression model and considered statistically significant with p-value = 0.0002 or less.

pathways. DP-treatment alone diminished Shh signaling
(Figure  10D) and cyclopamine reduced nuclear Bcl3
staining (Figure 10E). These results suggest the
existence of crosstalk between the two pathways and
also demonstrate that p50/Bcl3-dependent transcriptional
activity supports BCC tumor growth in this murine model
and combined blockade of NFκB and Shh signaling is
substantially more effective in abrogating the growth of
BCCs in a mouse model of NBCCS.

The major underlying molecular defects involved in
the pathogenesis of NBCCS and in experimental animals
are Ptch1 gene mutations. Besides being the receptor for
hh ligands, Ptch1 is a potent tumor suppressor in the skin
[9, 20, 54]. Mutant Ptch1 with diminished or absence of
tumor suppressor activity results in the growth of BCCs
in humans as well as in experimental animal models
[9, 20, 54]. These Ptch1 mutations also occur in patients
with sporadic BCCs. However, in patients with NBCCS,
germline allelic loss coupled with multiple mutations
in the remaining wild-type Ptch1 allele typically leads
to the appearance of large numbers of BCCs and other
extracutaneous malignancies [11, 36, 79]. Molecular
characterization of BCCs in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice which
carry only one mutant allele of Ptch1 show augmented
expression of Shh signaling-related genes and enhanced
expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins essential for
accelerated cell proliferation. In addition, consistent with
the known molecular pathogenesis of UVB-induced skin
cancer, both Ptch1 and p53 mutations (C-T transversion)
are common in BCCs induced in chronically UVBirradiated Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice. Cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers are the major DNA photoproduct formed by UVB
including cytosine to thymine (C to T) transitions when
two pyrimidines are adjacent to each other or, at times,
CC to TT transitions and both types lead to mutations
designated as signature mutations for UV damage [4, 5].
Cyclopamine is an alkaloid that was isolated from
the American Corn Lilly, a plant that grows wild in the
Northwestern United States. It was known to be a classical
Smo inhibitor and has been shown to block UVB-induced
Shh signaling and BCC development [53, 54]. The FDAapproved drug vismodegib, an analog of cyclopamine
that was developed by Genentech, is a more potent SMO
inhibitor as compared to cyclopamine despite both binding
to Smo at the same site [33, 55, 83]. The FDA-approved
triazole antifungal drug ITRA is also a SMO inhibitor
that binds the molecule at a site distinct from that of
cyclopamine or vismodegib [34, 60]. The emergence of
ITRA as a clinically useful SMO inhibitor is of particular
interest and importance. Because this antifungal drug has a
long record of clinical safety, it has excellent potential for
use as a systemic agent for the chemoprevention of BCCs
in NBCCS [34, 35]. A major limitation of vismodegib is
the frequent development of drug resistance as a result
of acquired Smo mutations that reduce its SMO- binding
affinity [32, 57, 84]. Since ITRA binds to SMO at a
different site, its efficacy seems to be unaffected by these
vismodegib-associated mutations [60]. In this study, we
utilized our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice to assess the efficacy
and safety of both vismodegib and itraconazole. Each of
these was only partially effective in inhibiting the growth
of BCCs and these results closely mimic those observed
in clinical trials of vismodegib and ITRA in patients with
NBCCS [33, 35, 57].

DISCUSSION
NBCCS is an autosomal dominant disorder with
an estimated incidence of 1:57,000 [36, 79]. While
sporadic NMSCs including SCCs and BCCs are common
in Caucasian populations, the pathogenesis of BCCs in
patients with NBCCS is known to occur in multiple ethnic
groups of varying degrees of skin pigmentation albeit
with varying penetrance [14, 79]. However, Caucasians
typically develop higher numbers of BCCs as compared
to other darker races [13, 80]. Thus, genetic background
may influence disease penetrance as demonstrated by
predisposition and severity of symptoms, including
developmental defects and the growth of skin and
extracutaneous neoplasms. A relevant animal model that
encompasses the phenotype of NBCCS has been slow to
develop and currently no murine model exists that closely
manifests the exact pathophysiology of the disease [24, 27,
52]. To date, the available murine models manifest only
selected features of NBCCS but more closely resemble
sporadic BCCs [24, 27]. Furthermore, penetrance of
the disease in these models is only 10–15% [24, 27].
Considering the known dependence of severity and
propensity of disease symptoms on genetic background
in humans, we developed a murine model that closely
resembles NBCCS by transferring Ptch1 heterozygosity
from a tumor-resistant mouse strain (C57BL/6) to SKH-1,
a strain that is highly susceptible to skin tumorigenesis
[26]. As is the case with NBCCS patients who typically
develop multiple BCCs on both sun-exposed and sunprotected body areas, our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice develop
spontaneous BCCs with high frequency (incidence of
40%) in any anatomic area over their lifetime. Similar
to NBCCS patients these animals develop BCCs early
in life and they also are susceptible to other Shh-driven
internal malignancies including RMS and to a lesser
extent medulloblastomas [15, 81]. We found that a single
exposure of Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice to IR (5 Gy) results in
hundreds of BCCs over their entire body including both
dorsal and ventral skin, thereby recapitulating the fact that
exposure of NBCCS patients to therapeutic IR has led to
field cancerization [24, 82]. Histological examination of
the skin of the IR-treated Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice revealed
numerous BCCs in a pattern identical to that occurring in
the IR-treated NBCCS patients [36, 79].

In one of his classical reviews of NBCCS
published in 1987 Gorlin pointed out that “…
independent observations of increased prostaglandin
levels associated … with aggressiveness of basal cell
cancers merit further investigation both as a fundamental
cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment
(e.g., with antiprostaglandins)”. The cyclooxygenases
(COXs) are arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes that
generate prostaglandins involved in the pathogenesis
of inflammatory responses including those induced in
the skin following UVB exposure [85–87]. In particular
UVB irradiation of the skin is known to induce COX-2
thereby, enhancing the prostaglandin E2 production that
drives cell proliferation and neoplastic growth [88]. Not
surprisingly, NSAIDs have shown some efficacy as cancer
chemopreventive agents [85, 88–90]. We previously
showed that COX-2 is highly expressed in the stroma
of both human and murine BCCs emphasizing its likely
contribution to tumor growth perhaps by altering the
tumor microenvironment [59]. Importantly, Shh signaling
also modulates the tumor stroma and tumor-associated
microenvironment [91–94]. Furthermore, employing both
genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed in
a murine model of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis
and in patients with NBCCS that overexpression of
COX-2 accompanies accelerated BCC growth whereas
NSAID-induced COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib partially
(30–50%) abrogates growth of these tumors [59, 85, 95].
Based on the known risk of cardiac events in
patients treated with ‘Coxibs’ [96] and also reported
resistance to these drugs in a small subset of the human
population [97], in this study we have also assessed the
chemopreventive effects of sulindac, a known COX
inhibitor in our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice and show that it has
partial efficacy in reducing the growth of UVB-induced
BCCs. Inhibiting inflammation alone or Shh signaling
alone is only partially effective in blocking the growth of
BCCs in our murine model or in humans with NBCCS.
These results further emphasize that Ptch1+/−/SKH-1
mice not only recapitulate the global phenotypic pattern
and the molecular pathogenesis of BCCs in NBCCS
but also mimic the responses to chemopreventive and
chemotherapeutic agents similar to those observed
in patients with this syndrome. In further studies we
have clearly shown that by combining a Shh inhibitor
(vismodegib or ITRA) and a COX inhibitor (the NSAID
Sulindac) it is possible to obtain superior anti-tumor
efficacy as compared to either class alone in  treating
BCCs in our murine model of NBCCS (Figure 11). Our
results indicate that this combination almost completely
blocks the growth of these lesions, suggesting that
combinatorial regimens utilizing Smo inhibitors and
NSAIDS offer potentially superior benefit for patients
with NBCCS. It is important to emphasize that sulindac
is being employed as one of the chemopreventive drugs

in a recently NCI-funded “Adenoma and Second Primary
Prevention Trial (ID # S0820).
In the course of these studies we also searched
for the possible involvement of pro-inflammatory
signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of BCCs. NFκB
is a transcription factor that has been closely linked to the
pathogenesis of cutaneous inflammation and neoplasia
including that induced by UVB [71, 72]. Crosstalk
between NFκB and Shh signaling has been described
in a variety of experimental settings [63–65, 92]. UVB
has been shown to activate NFκB transcriptional activity
during skin tumorigenesis [98]. Since, we have observed
augmented basal and UVB-induced inflammatory
responses in Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 as compared to the parental
Ptch1+/+/SKH-1 strain, we postulated that NFκB activation
may contribute to the pathogenesis of BCCs. Cytosolic
inactive NFκB is a trimeric protein complex consisting of
p65/p50/IkB and/or p65/p52/IkB complexes as described
in Figure 11. Following various stimuli, phosphorylationdependent degradation of inhibitory IkB occurs, leading
to the release of transcriptionally active p65/p50 or p65/
p52 protein complexes, that migrate to the nucleus where
they can bind to promoters of genes that drive expression
of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways [99, 100]. Indeed,
we found enhanced expression of phosphorylated IkB
during the pathogenesis of humans BCCs and BCCs that
develop in our mouse model.
NFκB is known to transcribe a diverse array of
genes including those that orchestrate tissue inflammation,
cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptotic responses
during cancer pathogenesis [41, 62, 99]. Unlike, the
known involvement of canonical p65-dependent NFκB
transcriptional activity in the growth of UVB-induced
SCCs [98, 101], we show here enhancement of Bcl3regulated non-canonical NFκB signaling in BCCs;
furthermore we also found similar nuclear localization
of the p50-Bcl3 complex in BCCs from patients with
NBCCS. These studies reveal the importance of Bcl3 in
the pathogenesis of this neoplasm. Bcl3 is known to be
involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological
processes {For review please see [102]}. It serves as
an oncogene in the pathogenesis of certain neoplasms
[103–106]. It also regulates TLR-mediated macrophage
responses [71]. We discovered here an additional novel
aspect of this signaling which indicates the involvement of
crosstalk with Shh pathway in promoting the pathogenesis
of BCCs.
The exact mechanism that regulates Bcl3 expression
is not clear [107]. However, multiple pathways are known
to modulate Bcl3 expression [69, 107] including Th2
cytokines [73]. Furthermore human BCCs manifest a Th2
dominant tumor microenvironment [72]. We observed a
similar Th2 microenvironment in UVB-induced murine
BCCs in our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice. Bcl3 expression is also
known to be modulated by cyld protein, a deubiquitinating

complex and its transcriptional activation drives overexpression of downstream target genes such as Cyclin D1 and N-cadherin. Moreover,
activation of both Shh and p50/Bcl3 signaling pathways in basal keratinocytes drive pathogenesis of BCCs in the murine model of NBCCS
and in patients with NBCCS. Inhibition of these two pathways together abrogates BCC development in Ptch1+/-/SKH-1 mice.

enzyme [108]. Mutated cyld drives the pathogenesis of
cylindromas, an unusual benign human skin neoplasm
of hair follicle origin [109]. Cyld inhibits tumor cell
proliferation by blocking Bcl3-dependent NFkB signaling.
Reduced expression of cyld was previously reported in
BCCs [109, 110] and was also confirmed in this study.
Since we could not identify a specific inhibitor
of the Bcl3-p50 pathway, we attempted an alternative
approach. The upstream kinase IKKα/β which often
regulates NFκB signaling and modulates the pathogenesis
of cancer development, has been identified as an important
molecular target for the cancer treatment and prevention
[75]. It was also reported that SSZ, an FDA-approved
drug used for treating psoriatic arthritis [76, 77], is a
potent inhibitor of this kinase [111, 112]. In this study,
we employed this drug to clarify the role of Bcl3 in the
pathogenesis of BCCs in our murine model. We observed
that SSZ reduces nuclear accumulation of Bcl3 and
inhibits the growth of BCCs. Furthermore combining SSZ
with cyclopamine enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy.
Bcl3’s involvement in the pathogenesis of BCCs
was further confirmed by our studies showing that intratumoral injections of a cell permeable p50 decoy peptide
(DP) blocked nuclear translocation of Bcl3 and retarded
BCC growth. Use of this DP specifically blocks nuclear
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

translocation of Bcl3 [78] thereby reducing its ability to
transcriptionally activate BCC cell proliferation. Despite
concerns about the specificity of this approach [113], we
believe that the multiple studies performed here provide
a strong support to the concept that both Shh and Bcl3dependent non-canonical NFκB may be crucial for
the pathogenesis of BCCs particularly in patients with
NBCCS. Reduced expression of cyclin D1/N-cadherin
in residual tumors coupled with static tumor growth
confirmed the importance of p50/Bcl3 in the growth of
BCCs in our Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice. Moreover, tumor
regression by the combined inhibition of Shh and Bcl3
signaling pathways suggests that targeting these two
pathways might substantially enhance anti-tumor efficacy
in our NBCCS model system (For summary please see
Figure 11). p50 DP can also block p65 transcriptional
activity in tumor infiltrating macrophages [114] suggesting
that this pathway may also be involved in inhibiting tumor
growth. Increased Bcl3 expression occurs in a variety of
cancers [105, 107, 115] and some non-cancer-related
inflammatory skin conditions such as contact dermatitis
[73, 116]. Our observations that Bcl3 knockdown inhibits
Shh signaling and blocking Shh signaling with multiple
agents diminishes Bcl3-dependent signaling point toward
meaningful crosstalk between the Shh and Bcl3-dependent

signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of BCCs in this
murine model and potentially in NBCCS patients.
In summary, our studies describe a novel and
unique murine model for NBCCS that will permit more
detailed investigation of the molecular pathogenesis and
chemoprevention of BCCs in patients with this dominantly
inherited disorder. The studies described here provide a
compelling rationale for prospective clinical trials using
combinations of small molecular weight inhibitors of Smo
and COX in patients with NBCCS to reduce tumor burden.
These studies also highlight the importance of a hitherto
undescribed Bcl3-signaling in the pathogenesis of BCCs
that are relevant to our experimental model of NBCCS and
to patients with this disease.

lack of UVC emission. The dose of UVB was quantified
with X-96 Meter from Daavlin. The radiation was further
calibrated with an ILI700 Research radiometer/photometer
from International Light Inc. (Newburyport, MA). The
distance between the radiation source and targets was
maintained at 25 cm. The irradiation assembly was kept in
an air-conditioned room with an additional fan to maintain
the ambient temperature.

UVB-irradiation protocol and treatments
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice (10–25 generation)
were used for UVB-irradiation and various treatments
(unless described otherwise) which were divided into
different groups of 20 mice each. Mice left untreated,
served as age-matched control (negative control). Mice
were irradiated with UVB (180 mJ/cm2; twice/week)
and treated with vehicle control, served as positive
control. Whereas, test groups were administered with
cyclopamine (20 mg/kg body weight; I.P.) or GDC-0449
(40 mg/kg body weight; oral) or itraconazole (40 mg/kg
body  weight; oral) or sulindac (80 mg/kg body weight;
topical in acetone), twice a week, 30 min prior to UVB
irradiation. SSZ (300 ppm) was administered in drinking
water [26]. These treatments and UVB-irradiation were
carried out for 30 week. Additionally, in p50 decoy peptide
experiment, 30 weeks following UVB irradiation, tumor
lesions were treated with antennapedia control peptide
or with p50 decoy peptide (Imgenex, San Diego, CA;
intralesional; 25 μg/tumor in 50 μl PBS). The tumor
number and size were recorded weekly using electronic
Vernier Caliper as described earlier [86]. Data were
presented as mean ± SE and plotted as a function of
weeks on test. The experiment was terminated and all
mice were euthanized as per IACUC recommendations.
Skin and tumor tissues were harvested and processed for
histological and biochemical analysis as described in the
following sections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice
Male breeders (6–7 weeks old) of Ptch1+/−/
C57BL/6 mice which were developed by deletion of
exons 1 and 2 and insertion of the LacZ gene at the
deletion site as described previously were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) [26, 27].
The female breeders of SKH-1 hairless strain (5–6 weeks
old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories,
Massachusetts and acclimatized for a week as described
earlier [86]. One male and two female mice were
placed together in individual cages for mating. After
confirming pregnancies, the males and females were
separated. Twenty-one days after birth, the litters were
separated from their mothers. At the age of 4 weeks,
these animals were sexed and separated. The litters
were genotyped by tail clipping at the age of 10–11 days
using primers TGGCTGAGAGCGAAGTTTCAG and
TTCCACCCACAGCTCCTCCAC
for
wild-type
and GGATGATCTGGACGAAGAGC and AGAAGGCGA
TAGAAGGCGAT for truncated alleles. Ptch1+/−/SKH-1
hairless mice (F2) were selected for backcrossing onto
SKH-1 hairless mice again to minimize the C57BL/6
genetic background for an additional 9 generations,
resulting in a colony of Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 mice as described
in Supplemental Figure 1. Data presented from various
experiments in this study were generated employing mice
between 10 and 25 generations.

IR irradiation
IR irradiation was performed from X-RAD 320
Irradiation System (Precision X-ray, Inc. North Branford,
CT) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Six to seven-week old Ptch1+/−/SKH-1 hairless mice
were randomly divided into two groups of 20 mice
each. Group-I mice served as age-matched control and
left untreated (negative control). Group-II mice were
irradiated with a single exposure of IR (5Gy) and kept for
observations. The tumor number and size were recorded
once a week using electronic Vernier Caliper. Data were
presented as mean ± SE and plotted as a function of
weeks on test. After termination of experiment, tumors
were then harvested and analyzed for the biochemical,
immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis
exactly as described earlier [26].

UV light source
A UV Irradiation Unit (Daavlin Co., Bryan,
OH) was employed for these studies. The UVB source
consisted of 6 Broadband UVB lamps ranging from 290
to 320 nanometers. We employed a Kodacel cellulose
film (Kodacel TA401/407) to eliminate UVC radiation.
A UVC sensor (Oriel’s Goldilux UVC Probe, Stratford
CT) was used routinely during each exposure to confirm

the sections were rinsed with PBS and mounted with
mounting medium containing DAPI. Fluorescence was
immediately recorded on an Olympus EX51 microscope.

For β-gal staining, 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2%
formalin-fixed tissues were treated with X-gal and iron
buffer solution for overnight at room temperature and
processed using the vender’s protocol (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). Microscopic BCC-like lesions (β-gal-positive)
were counted as numbers and size per unit area (mm2)

Tris base, 137 mM NaCl, 3.8 mM HCl, pH 7.6) for 2 hours
at ambient temperature followed by overnight probing
with primary antibody at 4°C. After washing the blot
three times in TTBS for 10 minutes each, the membrane
was incubated for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (dilution- 1:2,000, Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). The blot was washed three times
in TTBS for 10 minutes each and was developed with ECL
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham,
Arlington Heights, IL).

Scoring tumor incidence and multiplicity
Visible tumors greater than 2 mm in diameter were
counted weekly and the data presented as % mice with
tumors and also as number of tumors/mouse. Tumor size
was recorded using electronic Vernier Caliper.

Immunohistochemical staining
The paraffin tissue sections were deparaffinized,
rehydrated and pretreated with 10 mM citrate buffer,
pH 6.0 for 10 minutes at 95°C. The non-specific sites
were blocked in 2.5% goat serum and bovine serum
albumin (0.5% w/v) for 1 hour followed by overnight
incubation at 4°C in the following primary antibodies:
PCNA (Santa Cruz, sc-9857, 1:100), Gli-1 (Santa Cruz,
sc-20687, 1:100); Hhip (Santa Cruz, sc-9406, 1:100).
The sections were then washed and incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibody. Color reaction was
observed using the ABC peroxidase detection system
using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin (Sigma), and mounted using permount
(Sigma).

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
TUNEL assay was done by using in situ cell death
detection, fluorescein kit from Roche Applied Science
following manufacturer’s guidelines.

Promega (E3292; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). 3.5 pmol
of NFκB consensus oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled
with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega
Corp., Madison, WI). Nuclear protein extracts (10 μg) were
incubated on ice for 10 min. with 4 μl of gel shift binding
5X buffer (Promega Corp. Madison, WI) containing
20% glycerol (v/v), 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5

1μl of γ-32P labeled oligonucleotide was then added, and
incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature.
In the competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess
of unlabeled probe was added before the labeled probe.
Reaction products were separated on 4% polyacrylamide
gels run in 0.5XTBE buffer at 120V at room temperature.
After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to
X-ray film overnight at -700C. In the supershift assays, 2 μg
of affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were added after
binding reactions and incubation was further continued
for 30 min at room temperature. The antibodies for the
supershift assays were purchased from Santa Cruz (NFκB

Inflammation cytokines/chemokines PCR array

IPTG-mediated knock-down of Bcl3

PCR Array was done using SABiosciences PCR Array
System as described earlier [117]. Briefly, cDNA synthesis
was done using RT2 First Strand kit. Real-time PCR was
done with Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines & Receptors
PCR Arrays using RT2 qPCR Master Mix. For each group,
3 skin samples were used for PCR array analysis. Relative
fold changes of gene expression were calculated according
to the manufacturer’s instruction and software.

We used the pLKO_IPTG_3XLacO vector
(Sigma), which has been designed to contain a LacI
(repressor) and a modified human U6 shRNA promoter
with LacO (operator) sequences, to mediate inducible
Bcl3 specific RNA interference in basal cell carcinoma
cells (ASZ cells). In the absence of IPTG (isopropyl-ßD-thiogalactoside), an analogue of lactose, LacI binds to
LacO preventing expression of the Bcl3 shRNA. When
IPTG is present, the allosteric LacI repressor changes
conformation, releasing itself from lacO modified human
U6 promoter, and subsequently allows expression of the
Bcl3 shRNA. Stable pools and single cell clones was
propagated at the appropriate puromycin concentration
without the addition of IPTG. A 70–80% knock down
efficiency was observed after 72 hours treatment of  IPTG.

DNA extraction and mutation screening for the
Ptch1 gene
Tissues were then digested in a buffer with
proteinase K (Qiagen) at 55°C overnight. The tumor
genomic DNA was then extracted following the
instructions. A set of primers (Ptch1 Wild-type,
forward CTGCGGCAAGTTTTTGGTTG and reverse
AGGGCTTCTCGTTGGCTACAAG; Ptch1 mutant,
forward GCCCTGAATGAACTGCAGGACG and reverse
CACGGGTAGCCAACGCTATGTC flanking exon 23 of
the Ptch1 gene were used to amplify tumor genomic DNA.
These PCR amplicons were then purified and sequenced
by GeneWiz Inc. The mutation was identified by visual
inspection and comparison with control sequences
generated from wild-type samples.
