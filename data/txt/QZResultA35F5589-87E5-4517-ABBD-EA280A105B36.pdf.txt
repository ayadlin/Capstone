Rationale for the Development of IMC-3G3, a
Fully Human Immunoglobulin G Subclass 1
Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the PlateletDerived Growth Factor Receptor a*

A large body of evidence suggests that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family and associated receptors
are potential targets in oncology therapeutic development because of their critical roles in the proliferation and survival of various cancers and in the regulation and growth of the tumor stroma and blood vessels. Several small molecules that nonspecifically target the PDGF signaling axis are in current use or development as anticancer therapies.
However, for the majority of these agents, PDGF and its receptors are neither the primary targets nor the principal
mediators of anticancer activity. IMC-3G3, a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G subclass 1,
specifically binds to the human PDGF receptor a (PDGFRa) with high affinity and blocks PDGF ligand binding and
PDGFRa activation. The results of preclinical studies and the frequent expression of PDGFRa in many types of cancer
and in cancer-associated stroma support a rationale for the clinical development of IMC-3G3. Currently, IMC-3G3 is
being evaluated in early clinical development for patients with several types of solid malignancies. Cancer 2010;116(4

Over the last 2 decades, therapies that target tumor and endothelial cell surface receptors or their ligands have emerged
as valuable treatment options in clinical oncology. In certain cases, such as the small molecule imatinib in the treatment of
chronic myelogenous leukemia and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2/neu-amplified breast
cancer, these targeted therapies have led to significant improvements in clinical outcomes.1,2 Since the discovery that the
v-sis oncogene is derived from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B chain gene,3 the PDGF receptor (PDGFR)
has been an appealing target for anticancer therapeutic development.
It has been demonstrated that PDGF/PDGFR signaling influences cancer biology through 3 distinct but interacting
mechanisms: 1) the autocrine growth stimulation of cancer cells, 2) the regulation of stromal-derived fibroblasts, and 3)
the regulation of angiogenesis.4 The specific targeting of PDGFRs with a therapeutic antibody may interrupt this signaling
axis, suppressing tumor growth by inhibiting the tumor directly and/or disrupting its supporting stroma and blood vessels.
Antibody-based approaches may have some advantages over approaches based on small molecules, including greater target
specificity, less off-target toxicity, and an additional capacity for immune-mediated cytotoxicity.5 In this report, we review
the PDGF and PDGFR system, focusing on PDGFRa as a target for anticancer therapeutic development. In addition,

agents in current use or development that target PDGF/
PDGFR, particularly IMC-3G3 (a fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 [IgG1] monoclonal antibody to
PDGFRa), are reviewed.
The PDGF/PDGFR Axis in Cellular Signaling
The PDGFs are a family of ligands consisting of disulfidebonded PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C, or PDGF-D
polypeptide chains.6 The individual ligand monomer
chains form the following heterodimers or homodimers:
PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC, and
PDGF-DD.7 Ligand dimerization is a requirement for
signaling, which occurs when these PDGF dimers bind to
and activate 2 structurally related cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors, PDGFRa and PDGFRb.8
PDGFRa and PDGFRb both are members of the
class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and have
molecular weights of approximately 170 kilo Daltons
(kDa) and 180 kDa, respectively.7 These receptors are the
products of 2 homologous genes located on chromosomes
7 and 22, respectively.9 The extracellular region of each
receptor contains 5 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains,
whereas the intracellular region contains a tyrosine kinase
domain.10 Upon PDGF binding, receptor homodimerization or heterodimerization is induced, resulting in the
formation of PDGFR-aa, PDGFR-ab, and PDGFR-bb.
All PDGF isoforms except PDGF-DD are capable of
inducing homodimerization of PDGFRa, whereas only
PDGF-BB and PDGF-DD are capable of inducing
homodimerization of PDGFRb. In addition, in cells that
express both PDGFRa and PDGFRb, heterodimerization of the receptors can be induced by all PDGF isoforms
except PDGF-AA (Fig. 1).11
After dimerization, each PDGFR partner phosphorylates the other on specific tyrosine residues located on
their cytosolic tails.7 This autophosphorylation activates
downstream signaling by 1) further boosting the kinase
activity of the receptor through the additional phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the kinase domain,
and 2) creating high-affinity docking sites for the Src
homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adapter molecules
(eg, Grb2, Grb7, Crk, Nck, and Shc) that lack intrinsic
enzymatic activity but serve as links to other downstream
effectors.6
PDGFR-aa, PDGFR-ab, and PDGFR-bb transduce a variety of cellular signals that act to prevent apoptosis (survival signaling), stimulate mitogenesis
(proliferative signaling), stimulate cellular chemotaxis, and
increase the concentration of intracellular calcium.12-14

Figure 1. This graphic depicts the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) family and its associated
ligands.

These effects are mediated through several well characterized downstream signaling cascades induced by the activation of PDGFRs, including the Ras/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway, and the phospholipase C-c1
(PLC-c1) pathway. The PI3-K pathway is critical for
PDGF-induced prevention of apoptosis, actin reorganization, and cell migration.15 Ras and its associated downstream MAPK cascade mediate the cell proliferative effects
of PDGF. Ras is regulated through the adapter molecule
Grb2 in conjunction with son of sevenless-1 (sos-1) and
by subsequent modulation of the ratio of the inactive guanosine diphosphate-bound Ras form to the active guanosine triphosphate-bound form. Ras signal transduction
also may affect cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology by activating the tyrosine kinases Src and Abl.16 The
tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of PLC-c1 by PDGF
leads to an increase in the turnover of phosphatidylinositol,17 a second messenger that increases intracellular calcium stores and thereby regulates calcium-driven
intracellular signaling.18
The Role of PDGF in Development
and Disease
It has been demonstrated that both PDGFRa and
PDGFRb are involved in organ development and function and in the pathogenesis of several nonmalignant and
malignant diseases.7,19-23 The evidence for a critical role
played by PDGF/PDGFR signaling during embryonic
development includes the finding that deletion of either

1019

Original Article

receptor is lethal to the embryo.19,20 PDGFRa is important for the mesenchymal cell development of many tissues, including the intestines, kidney, and skin. The
receptor also plays a role in regulating the development
and maturation of chondrocytes, non-neuronal neural
crest, and lung alveolar smooth muscle.7,21,22 PDGFRb
signaling is critical for normal vascular smooth muscle development and pericyte recruitment to capillaries19 and
for development of the peripheral nervous system.23
In normal adult tissues, PDGFR expression varies
widely among cell types.24 High-density PDGFRa
expression is characteristic of platelets, megakaryocytes,
fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, neurons, and myoblasts. The predominant cell types with
high-density PDGFRb expression are fibroblasts, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells.4,7,24
It has been demonstrated that PDGF signaling
affects wound repair as well as the pathogenesis of several
nonmalignant diseases. PDGFs accelerate inflammation
and wound healing by activating mitogenesis, chemotaxis,
and protein synthesis in PDGFR-positive fibroblasts and
smooth muscle cells.25-27 Hyperactive signaling along the
PDGF/PDGFR axis also has been demonstrated in several
nonmalignant disorders, such as atherosclerosis,28,29 pulmonary fibrosis (both PDGFRa and PDGFRb),30,31 hepatic cirrhosis (PDGFRb only),32,33 and glomerular
diseases characterized by mesangial proliferation.34-40
PDGFRb-associated functions in cancer biology include
pericyte recruitment and the regulation of interstitial fluid
pressure in tumors, and the latter may affect the uptake of
anticancer therapeutics into malignant tumors.41-43
The Role of PDGFRa in Malignancy
PDGF/PDGFRa signaling plays a relevant role in cancer
biology not only because of direct effects on tumor cells
but also because of paracrine effects mediated by
PDGFRa expressed on tumor stroma and effects mediated through the regulation of malignant angiogenesis
(Fig. 2).44-60 Several types of cancers, particularly those
derived from the ovary, prostate, breast, lung, brain, skin,
and bone, express PDGFRa on the malignant cells themselves (Table 1).22 In 1 experiment in which a human tumor array was probed with a cross-reactive polyclonal
rabbit antibody to PDGFRa, PDGFRa expression was
noted in approximately 95% of osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas, in 77% of prostate cancers, in 52% of ovarian cancers, in 65% of breast cancers, and in 51% of lung
cancers (N. Loizos, ImClone Systems, unpublished
results). A separate investigation demonstrated strong im-

PDGFs can influence cancer growth and malignant angiogenesis through several mechanisms, including the activation of
PDGFRa expressed on cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts, and
vascular endothelial cells and by PDGF-induced production
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by stromal
cells.45-55,57,60 The asterisk indicates that Table 1 provides a

munohistochemical staining (2 to 3þ) in 89% of the clear
cell histologic subtype of ovarian cancers.50 Gene amplifications of PDGFRa have been identified in a subset of
malignant gliomas,62 and activating mutations of
PDGFRa have been discovered in a proportion of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.63 Tumor PDGFRa expression
has been associated with disease progression in renal cell
cancer,64 diminished survival in ovarian cancer,56 lymph
node metastasis in breast cancer,58 and bone metastases in
prostate cancer.59
Investigations in multiple cancer types have highlighted the relevance of both PDGF-activated tumor and
supporting stromal cells in facilitating cancer growth and
metastasis.44-51,55,57,60 In some cases, specific autocrine or
paracrine mechanisms that contribute to malignant progression have been suggested. In 1 experiment, NIH 3T3
cells were transformed when PDGF-A or PDGF-B gene
expression was induced using a transfected promoter.44 In
another preclinical study, an autocrine mechanism of
ovarian cancer growth was identified by 1) a strong correlation of immunohistochemical staining for PDGF-AB
and PDGFRa on cancer cells, and 2) the finding that
growth media conditioned by ovarian cancer cells contained PDGF and, moreover, activated cellular proliferation through PDGFRa expressed on cancer cells.50

demonstrated that PDGF-driven paracrine signaling was

required for the development of malignant stroma,46 a
separate study indicated that the induction of PDGF-CC
expression in melanoma cells led to accelerated tumor
growth through the activation of PDGFRa.47 In the latter
study, the exclusive expression of PDGFRa on cancerassociated stromal fibroblasts illuminated a paracrine
mechanism of stromal-regulated melanoma tumor
growth. It also has been demonstrated that PDGF/
PDGFRa-associated autocrine or paracrine mechanisms
that involve tumor and stroma similarly play important
roles in the growth of hepatocellular cancers48,49 and lung
cancers,51 in facilitating bone metastasis in prostate cancers,60 and in the metastatic spread of lung and breast
cancers.45,57
It also has been established that an intact PDGF/
PDGFRa axis is required for vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) production by tumor stroma and for the
regulation of malignant angiogenesis in tumors that are
resistant to antiangiogenic treatment.52-54 The former
was demonstrated in an elegant experiment in which
VEGF-null fibrosarcomas grown in mice required the
recruitment of PDGFRa-expressing stromal fibroblasts
for VEGF production, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis.52
The recruitment of PDGFRa-expressing stromal fibroblasts depended on paracrine stimulation by PDGF-AA

produced from the tumor cells. When the PDGF/
PDGFRa axis was disrupted, both angiogenesis and tumorigenesis were reduced significantly. The importance
of the PDGF/PDGFRa axis in the regulation of malignant angiogenesis was demonstrated in another study in
which tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) from antiangiogenic therapy-resistant lymphomas (EL4) stimulated
the growth of antiangiogenic therapy-sensitive lymphomas (TIB6), even in the presence of VEGF inhibition.53
PDGF-C was up-regulated in these TAFs from EL4 (resistant) tumors, and PDGF-C-neutralizing antibodies
blocked angiogenesis and impeded cancer growth, suggesting that PDGF-C may be instrumental in mediating
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. The same investigation demonstrated that endothelial cells within EL4 lymphomas expressed both PDGFRa and PDGFRb, raising
the possibility that direct effects on endothelial cells also
may explain in part PDGF-mediated malignant angiogenesis. Collectively, these observations suggest that therapeutics targeting the PDGF/PDGFRa pathway may exert
anticancer effects not only through the interruption of
autocrine-driven and paracrine-driven pathways of tumor
growth but also through paracrine effects on cancer-associated vasculature.
Overview of PDGF-Targeting Agents
A partial list of PDGF/PDGFR-targeting agents is provided in Table 2. Although most are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inhibit multiple RTKs, 2
(IMC-3G3: ImClone Systems, Branchburg NJ; MEDI575: MedImmune, Gaithersburg, Md) are PDGFRa-targeting monoclonal antibodies.
Several small molecules nonspecifically inhibit the
PDGF/PDGFR axis, but with less potency compared
with their principal effects against other targets. For example, imatinib, a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine–derivative
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that principally targets Abl and
c-kit, also inhibits the tyrosine kinases of PDGFRa and
PDGFRb.65 Imatinib currently is approved in the United
States for the treatment of 1) Philadelphia chromosomepositive chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, both of which have a characteristic
bcr-abl translocation and increased kinase activity66,67;
and 2) gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which commonly
have activating c-kit mutations.68 Indications for the use
of imatinib that arise from imatinib’s specific effects on
PDGFR include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,
which has a distinguishing translocation involving
PDGF-B,69 and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome,

Development, Preclinical Results, and
Preliminary Clinical Results With IMC-3G3
(Human Anti-PDGFRa IgG1 Monoclonal
Antibody)
In light of the considerable role played by PDGFRa in
cancer growth, survival, and metastasis, the fully human
IgG1-type anti-PDGFRa monoclonal antibody IMC3G3 was developed as an anticancer therapeutic agent.
Hybridomas that produced high-affinity monoclonal
antibodies to the extracellular region of PDGFRa were
generated using human IgG transgenic mice.79 Further
selection led to the identification of IMC-3G3 as the most
potent and specific PDGFRa-neutralizing antibody.
IMC-3G3 subsequently was cloned into suitable vectors
for sequence analysis and stable expression as full-length
IgG1 in mammalian cells. IMC-3G3 binds to PDGFRa
with high affinity (Kd, 0.04 nM) and inhibits ligand binding with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.24
nM to 0.58 nM.79 The antibody does not cross-react with
PDGFRb or with murine PDGFRa.79 IMC-3G3 is

1022

approximately 100-fold more potent than imatinib with
respect to the inhibition of PDGF-induced cell proliferation (IC50, 1 nM for IMC-3G3 vs 100 nM for imatinib)
and PDGF-mediated PDGFRa signaling (IC50, 10 nM
for IMC-3G3 vs 1 lM for imatinib) (N. Loizos, ImClone
Systems, unpublished results).
Tumor stromal cells and stromal-influenced angiogenic factors are important for facilitating PDGF/
PDGFRa-mediated effects on cancer growth, as discussed
above. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments, in which
human cancer cells or animals bearing human tumor xenografts are treated with IMC-3G3, are likely to underestimate its potential anticancer activity, because cell lines
contain neither stroma nor blood vessels, and IMC-3G3
cannot react with mouse-derived stroma or regulate cancer-associated vasculature in xenograft experiments. In
humans, IMC-3G3 is expected to target PDGFRa
expressed in both tumor and stroma, thereby potentially
inhibiting tumor, stroma, and vasculature.
Preclinical studies of IMC-3G3 as a single agent or
in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy have demonstrated antimitogenic activity in cancer cell lines as well
as antitumor growth activity in human xenografts. One
set of in vitro experiments demonstrated that IMC-3G3
was capable of inhibiting any PDGF-induced proliferation or signaling through PDGFRa in both normal cell
lines and cancer cell lines, including U118 (glioblastoma)
and SKLMS-1 (leiomyosarcoma) cells.79 In a separate

study of mouse and human hepatoma cell lines grown to
confluence, treatment with IMC-3G3 as a single agent
resulted in significant decreases in both cell proliferation
and survival.48 Similarly, IMC-3G3 monotherapy led to a
significant decrease in PDGFRa-driven cell proliferation
in ovarian cancer cell lines.50 In vivo studies demonstrated
that treatment with IMC-3G3 as a single agent inhibited
the growth of glioblastoma (U118; 65% tumor growth inhibition) and leiomyosarcoma (SKLMS-1; 69% tumor
growth inhibition) human xenografts (Fig. 3), both of
which were chosen because of their expression of
PDGFRa.80 In the case of the glioblastoma xenografts,
IMC-3G3 monotherapy also reduced both PDGFRa
activation79 and activation of the MAPK proliferation
and Akt survival pathways (N. Loizos, ImClone Systems,
unpublished results). Finally, a combination study of
IMC-3G3 and doxorubicin conferred greater tumor
growth inhibition than either IMC-3G3 or doxorubicin
monotherapy in KHOS/NP human osteosarcoma cancer
xenografts (unpublished data).
On the basis of this preclinical activity and the absence of adverse effects associated with IMC-3G3 when
administered to cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 75
mg/kg,80 IMC-3G3 entered clinical development for
patients with advanced solid malignancies. In a phase 1
study of patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas who failed standard therapy or for whom no standard
therapy was available, patients received IMC-3G3 intrave-

nously as a single agent during the initial 6 weeks of therapy (4 weekly or 2 biweekly infusions followed by a 2week observation period).80 Patients who experienced an
objective response or stable disease continued to receive
additional therapy at the same dose and schedule in the
absence of disease progression or other withdrawal criteria. A preliminary review of the study results, at which
time 20 patients were enrolled in 5 dose cohorts (4 mg/kg,
8 mg/kg, and 16 mg/kg weekly; and 15 mg/kg and 20
mg/kg biweekly), revealed that IMC-3G3 was well tolerated, and there were no specific drug-related adverse
events reported.80 One patient with prostate cancer that
was refractory to hormone therapy and chemotherapy
experienced a prostate-specific antigen decrease >50% after treatment with IMC-3G3 at the 4-mg/kg dose level.80
Interim pharmacokinetic results indicated that weekly
infusions of 16 mg/kg and biweekly IMC-3G3 infusions
of 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg could attain or exceed the
trough concentrations required for human tumor growth
inhibition in xenograft studies.80 On the basis of these
preclinical and early clinical findings, several phase 2 clinical trials of IMC-3G3 in advanced solid malignancies are
currently in development.
Summary and Conclusions
PDGFRa inhibition by IMC-3G3 may impede cancer
growth through the direct inhibition of cancer cells and
supportive stroma and through the regulation of

malignant angiogenesis. Preclinical evaluations with
IMC-3G3 have demonstrated that the antibody inhibits
cancer growth in selected cancer cell lines and human xenograft models and confers enhanced anticancer activity
when combined with doxorubicin. However, it should be
recognized that the activity of IMC-3G3 in humans may
not be predicted adequately by current preclinical models
because of the absence of stroma and blood vessels in cell
lines and because of the lack of cross-reactivity of IMC3G3 with murine PDGFRa, which is expressed on
mouse-derived stroma in xenograft models. Preliminary
clinical results with IMC-3G3 reveal a favorable safety
profile. In the future, combination studies of PDGFR-targeting therapeutics with antiangiogenic agents may take
further advantage of the potential interplay among tumor,
stromal, and angiogenic factors that appear to be a hallmark of PDGFR signaling.
