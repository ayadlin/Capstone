Abstract
ABT-737 is a novel and potent Bcl-2 antagonist with singleagent activity against small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines.
Here, we evaluated the contribution of Bcl-2 family members
to the in vitro cellular response of several SCLC cell lines to
ABT-737. Relatively higher levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bim and
Noxa, and lower levels of Mcl-1 characterized naı̈ve SCLC cell
lines that were sensitive to ABT-737. Conversely, a progressive
decrease in the relative levels of Bcl-2 and Noxa and a
progressive increase in Mcl-1 levels characterized the increased resistance of H146 cells following chronic exposure to
ABT-737. Knockdown of Mcl-1 with small interfering RNA
sensitized two resistant SCLC cell lines H196 and DMS114 to
ABT-737 by enhancing the induction of apoptosis. Likewise,
up-regulation of Noxa sensitized H196 cells to ABT-737.
Combination treatment with DNA-damaging agents was
extremely synergistic with ABT-737 and was associated with
the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the up-regulation of Noxa,
Puma, and Bim in H196 cells. Thus, SCLC cells sensitive to
ABT-737 expressed the target proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL,
whereas Mcl-1 and factors regulating Mcl-1 function seem to
contribute to the overall resistance of SCLC cells to ABT-737.
Overall, these observations provide further insight as to the
mechanistic bases for ABT-737 efficacy in SCLC and will be
helpful for profiling patients and aiding in the rational design
of combination therapies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1176–83]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the
industrialized Western nations, and there are more than 1 million
new cases of lung cancer reported worldwide each year (1). Smallcell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up f15% to 20% of all lung cancers,
it is strongly associated with smoking and tends to grow and
spread quickly. If left untreated, the median survival time of SCLC
patients is 2 to 4 months (2). Initially, most SCLC tumors respond
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Typical chemotherapies involve
platinum-based regimens combined with etoposide (3–5). Unfortunately, relapse is common because the tumors become resistant
to further treatment, with a 5-year survival rate of f5% to 10%.
One of the factors implicated in the resistance of SCLC to

chemotherapy is the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2 (6–9). Unlike other oncogenes, Bcl-2 promotes tumorigenesis
by attenuating cell death as opposed to promoting cell proliferation
(10, 11). Thus, Bcl-2 allows tumor cells to ignore environmental
cues that signal cells to undergo apoptosis.
The bcl-2 oncogene was the first member of about 20
evolutionary conserved genes identified that encode closely
related proteins that possess either proapoptotic or antiapoptotic
activity (11, 12). The interaction of the Bcl-2 family members with
each other is largely responsible for the commitment of cells to
undergo apoptosis (13). One distinguishing feature is that they
share up to four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains (14). The multidomain antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members, such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-2,
Bcl-w, A1, and Mcl-1, inhibit cytochrome c release by blocking
the activation of the multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and
Bak (15). Bax and Bak are direct mediators of apoptosis and are
absolutely required for the initiation of the mitochondrial
apoptosis pathway (16, 17). The other proapoptotic members,
such as Bad, Bik, Bid, Bim, Hrk, Bmf, Noxa, and Puma, act as
molecular sensors of cellular stress or damage (18). They are
distinguished from Bax and Bak in that they possess only the
BH3 domain. They are mobilized and activated to initiate
apoptosis by modulating the activity of the other Bcl-2 family
members (17, 19–22).
The overexpression of Bcl-2 has been observed in a variety of
cancers and contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance (23). In
SCLC patients, the overexpression of Bcl-2 has been reported to
occur in 55% to 90% of all SCLC cases, and it has been suggested
to be a key factor involved in both the genesis and maintenance
of SCLC (24–28). Studies have shown that Bcl-2 also plays a
direct role in SCLC cell resistance to external apoptotic stimuli
(8, 9, 29, 30). For example, the apoptotic response of SCLC cells
to mitomycin C, irinotecan, and Adriamycin could be inhibited
by ectopically overexpressing Bcl-2 (8). Conversely, treatment
with Bcl-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides acted synergistically
with etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin to enhance the cell
killing of SCLC cell lines in vitro (31).
There have been several efforts to target Bcl-2 family members
for the treatment of neoplastic disease given their association with
cancer and resistance to numerous cytotoxic drugs (32–34).
Recently, we reported the discovery and biological properties of
ABT-737, a novel and potent Bcl-2 antagonist developed at Abbott
Laboratories (35). ABT-737 binds with high affinity (K i V 1 nmol/L)
to Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w and is two to three orders of magnitude
more potent than previously reported compounds (36). ABT-737
does not, however, bind strongly to Bcl-B, Mcl-1, or A1 (K i = 0.46 F
0.11, >1, and >1 Amol/L, respectively). ABT-737 exhibited singleagent activity against several cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However,

Factors Influencing SCLC Sensitivity to ABT-737

the response varied depending on the cell line, indicating that one
or more cellular-based mechanisms were contributing to the sensitivity to ABT-737.
Here, we evaluated the contribution of Bcl-2 and other Bcl-2
family members to the cellular response of SCLC cell lines to
ABT-737 by first establishing the co-relationship of Bcl-2 family
members with sensitivity to ABT-737 in a panel of 11 naı̈ve
SCLC cell lines and in the progressive adaptation of the sensitive
cell line H146 to ABT-737. Because correlative expression may
only be an epiphenomenon, we evaluated the mechanistic
contribution of two family members, Mcl-1 and Noxa, to SCLC
cellular resistance to ABT-737 by down-regulating Mcl-1 or
ectopically overexpressing Noxa in resistant SCLC cell lines.
Finally, we show that the cellular sensitivity of H196 cells treated
in combination with DNA-damaging agents and ABT-737 was
synergistic, and that the increase in sensitivity was associated
with decreased Mcl-1 levels and increased levels of the BH3-only
proteins Noxa, Puma, and Bim.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. ABT-737 ((R)-4-(3-dimethylamino-1-phenylsulfanylmethylpropylamino)-N-{4-[4-(4¶-chloro-biphenyl-2-ylmethyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-benzoyl}-3-nitro-benzenesulfonamide) was synthesized at Abbott Laboratories
(Abbott Park, IL). Carboplatin and etoposide were purchased from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO).
Cell culture. The SCLC cell lines NCI-H889, NCI-H1963, NCI-H1417, NCIH146, NCI-187, DMS79, NCI-1048, NCI-H82, NCI-H196, H69AR, and DMS114
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Corp., Grand Island, NY)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% sodium
pyruvate, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 4.5 g/L glucose, and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma). All cell lines were maintained in a humidified
chamber at 37jC containing 5% CO2.
The ABT-737–resistant H146 cells were derived from H146 cells by
initially adding 40 nmol/L ABT-737 to their culture medium and thereafter
doubling the concentration over a period of several months. Several drugresistant variants that adapted to and maintained in the presence of 40, 80,
160, 320, 640 and 1,280 nmol/L ABT-737 were generated in this manner and
were designated as H146-40, H146-80, etc.
Cell treatment and viability assays. Cells were treated for 48 h in
96-well tissue culture plates in a total volume of 100 AL tissue culture
medium supplemented with 10% human serum (Invitrogen). Each
concentration was tested in duplicate at least thrice separately. Viable
cells were determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive
cell proliferation MTS assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The
activation of caspase 3 was measured by the cleavage of the fluorometric substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth
Meeting, PA) or Z-DEVD-R110 (Promega) as described previously (37). For
combination treatment, H196 cells were plated at 1  104 cells/100 AL
and treated concurrently with increasing concentrations of carboplatin/
etoposide (at a fixed ratio of 2.5:1) and ABT-737 in the presence of 10%
human serum for 72 h. Cell viability was determined using Promega’s
CellTiter Glo assay. The combination index (CI) as described by Chou and
Talalay (38) was assessed using the software program CalcuSyn (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO) to quantitatively assess the effect of drug-combination
treatment. A CI value of 1.0 indicated an additive effect, CI values of <1.0
reflected a synergistic effect, and a CI value of >1.0 reflected an
antagonistic effect.
Western blot analysis. Total protein from cell lysates were separated on
4% to 20% gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The membranes were blocked with
TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for
1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4jC with
antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. We used anti–Bcl-XL (1 Ag/mL; 2300-

Systems (Minneapolis, MN); anti–Bcl-2 (1:500; 610539) and anti–Mcl-1
(1:500; 554103) from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti-Bak (1:1,000;
3792) and anti-aPuma (1:250; 4976) from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); antiBim (1 Ag/mL; AAP-330) from Stressgen (Victoria, BC); anti-Noxa (2 Ag/mL;
IMG-349) from Imgenex (San Diego, CA); and anti-actin (1:10,000; ab6276)
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Primary antibodies were detected using
either a goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) diluted
1:500 in blocking buffer for 0.5 h at room temperature. The membranes
were washed after each antibody step thrice for 5 min with TBS containing
0.2% Tween 20. Bands were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence
Plus (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and a STORM 860 molecular imager
(GE Healthcare). Quantitation of the protein level changes was done by
densitometry using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). The percent increase in
protein levels is defined as ((band intensity at time x
band intensity at
time 0 h)/band intensity at time 0 h)  100%.
Transfection protocols. H196 cells were plated at 1  104 cells/100 AL
in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach overnight. Small
interfering (si) RNA transfections were done using four siRNA duplexes
directed at different regions of the Mcl-1 gene (M-004501-02, M-004501-07,
M-004501-08, and M-004501-09, designated as siRNA-1, siRNA-2, siRNA-3,

and siRNA-4, respectively) or scrambled siRNA pool ( four negative control
siRNAs, D-001206-13) from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For Mcl-1 siRNA
transfections, 1.5 AL of a 20-Amol/L stock of Mcl-1 siRNAs and 3 AL of
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were each incubated separately with
100 AL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 10 min, mixed together for 20 min at
room temperature, and then 20 AL was applied to the cells ( final siRNA
concentration was 25 nmol/L). After incubating the cells for 3 to 4 h, the
medium was changed to RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum. The
following day, siRNA-transfected cells were either treated with ABT-737 for
48 h, and cell viability was assessed using Perkin-Elmer’s (Boston, MA)
ATPlite assay and used to measure the cleavage of Z-DEVD-R110 before and
6 h after the addition of ABT-737 to assess the induction of apoptosis.
DMS114 siRNA transfections were done using the siRNA duplex for
Mcl-1 (M-004501-02; siRNA-1), or scrambled siRNA (D-001210-01) from
Dharmacon as described above, and their viability was determined using
the MTS assay.
For Noxa transfections, H196 were plated at 6.0 to 7.5  105 cells in
six-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach overnight. The Flagtagged Noxa expression vector (1 or 2 Ag, GN012925, RefSeq no.
NM_021127, Genscript Corp., Piscataway, NJ) or control pDream2.1-cGFP
vector (SD0220, Genscript) were diluted in 250 AL Opti-MEM (Invitrogen),
and 10 AL LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to 250 AL OptiMEM. Both were incubated for 10 min separately and then together for
20 min at room temperature. The mixture (500 AL) was added to the cells
in 2 mL of culture medium. After incubating the cells for 3 h, the medium
was changed with fresh medium containing 10% human serum. The
following day, plasmid-transfected cells were transferred to 96-well plates
at 10  104 cells per well and treated with ABT-737 for 48 h in medium
containing 10% human serum. Cell viability was assessed using Promega’s
MTS assay.
Microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines, and 5 Ag
was used for microarray analysis using the standard protocol provided by
Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Fragmented, labeled cRNA synthesized
using an IVT labeling kit, (Enzo, New York, NY) was hybridized to an
Affymetrix human genome U133A version 2.0 Affymetrix microarrays at
45jC overnight. The scanned image and intensity files were imported in
the Rosetta Resolver gene expression analysis software version 5.1 (Rosetta
Inpharmatics, Kirkland, WA). Resolver’s Affymetrix error model was
applied, and replicates were combined. Combined intensity values were

exported into Spotifire (Spotifire, Inc., Somerville, MA) to generate heat
maps, with red indicating a high expression and green indicating a low
expression using intensity z score values normalized for each gene
individually, across all experiments being analyzed. Expression profiles
were derived from mRNA from two or more independent samples for each
cell line.

Results
ABT-737 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a
subset of SCLC cells. The ability of ABT-737 to inhibit cell
proliferation with single-agent activity was evaluated against a
panel of 11 naı̈ve SCLC cell lines (Fig. 1). The cellular response
based on the cell proliferation EC50 values ranged from as low as
20 nmol/L for NCI-H889 cells to >100 Amol/L for DMS114 cells
following treatment for 48 h (Fig. 1A). To assess the ability of ABT737 to directly induce apoptosis, we measured the cleavage of
Ac-DEVD-AMC, a substrate for activated caspase 3, following
treatment of H146 cells for 24 h. A dose-dependent increase in
apoptosis coincided with a dose-dependent decrease in cell
viability following ABT-737 treatment (Fig. 1B) suggesting that
ABT-737 inhibits cell proliferation through the induction of
apoptosis.
Expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins that correlate with
cellular response to ABT-737. The relative mRNA and protein
expression profiles of several Bcl-2 family members were evaluated
in 11 SCLC cell lines to determine if their expression patterns
correlated with cellular response to ABT-737 using microarray and
Western blot techniques. From the microarray analysis, Bcl-2 and
Noxa mRNA levels correlated directly with the cellular response to
ABT-737 (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Table 1) such that Bcl-2 and Noxa
expression were higher in cells that were more sensitive and lower
in cells that were more resistant to ABT-737. The same expression
pattern of Bcl-2 and Noxa were evident also at the protein level
(Fig. 2B). The protein levels of Bcl-XL also paralleled that of Bcl-2;
however, it was not reflected at the RNA level, suggesting that

Factors Influencing SCLC Sensitivity to ABT-737

Bcl-XL expression may be differentially regulated at the translational or protein stability level. The protein levels of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim also trended similarly to
Bcl-2 such that it was lower in cells lines with increased resistance
to ABT-737.
Unlike Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, an inverse correlation with cell
sensitivity was observed with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
member, Mcl-1. Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels were higher in
cells that were resistant to ABT-737 and lower in cells that were
sensitive to ABT-737 (Fig. 2B). As for the other proapoptotic family
proteins Bax, Bak, and Bid, there was no clear correlation between
their expression and cellular response to ABT-737.
Bcl-2 and Noxa levels decrease and Mcl-1 levels increase in
H146 cells following chronic exposure to ABT-737. We next
evaluated the relative changes to the expression levels of Bcl-2
family members in H146 cells that became progressively resistant
to ABT-737 following continuous exposure for several months.
Several drug-resistant variants that were adapted to and
maintained in the presence of 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, and 1,280
nmol/L ABT-737 were generated. The cellular sensitivity for the
resistant variants ranged from an EC50 of 100 nmol/L for the
parental cells up to 1.5 Amol/L for the H146-1280–resistant
variants (Fig. 3A).
A reduction in the expression of both Bcl-2 and Noxa was
observed by microarray and Western blot analysis upon progressive
adaptation to ABT-737 in H146 cells (Fig. 3B and C; Supplemental
Table 2). On the other hand, there was a progressive increase in
Mcl-1 expression levels as H146 cells adapted to ABT-737. Because
similar trends were observed in the naı̈ve SCLC panel of cells, it is
suggestive that these proteins may contribute mechanistically to
the cellular response to ABT-737.
Decrease in Mcl-1 expression with siRNA sensitizes H196
cells to ABT-737. Given that expression correlations alone are not
sufficient to show a mechanistic role in resistance, functional
validation studies were conducted using RNAi technology. We
initially transfected one of the highly resistant SCLC cell lines,
H196, with Mcl-1 siRNA to show a causal relationship between
Mcl-1 expression and cellular resistance to ABT-737. H196 cells
(EC50 f55 Amol/L) were transfected with four different Mcl1–specific siRNAs at a final concentration of 25 nmol/L and then
treated with or without 20 Amol/L ABT-737 (EC20). Transfection
with each of the four Mcl-1 siRNAs resulted in knockdown in Mcl-1
protein levels compared with the scrambled siRNA control, but had
minimal effects on cell growth alone (Fig. 4A and B). Importantly,
Mcl-1 knockdown in the presence of ABT-737 corresponded to
enhanced H196 cell death (Fig. 4B). Notably, siRNA-1 and siRNA-4
that decreased Mcl-1 levels to the greatest extent also sensitized
H196 cells to ABT-737 to the greatest degree. There was a clear
dose response to ABT-737 in the presence of 25 nmol/L Mcl-1
siRNA-1 with an apparent EC50 of 0.14 Amol/L, which represented
approximately a 400-fold increase in the sensitivity of H196 cells to
ABT-737 treatment (Fig. 4C). Increased sensitivity to ABT-737 was
also observed following Mcl-1, but not scrambled siRNA transfection of the most resistant SCLC cell line, DMS114 (Fig. 4C). Unlike
H196, however, the viability of DMS114 cells was reduced by >50%
following Mcl-1 siRNA transfection alone and was further reduced
following treatment with ABT-737. The apparent EC50 of ABT-737
in DMS114 cells following Mcl-1 transfection was <0.2 Amol/L. In
both cells lines, an analogous dose response in the presence of
25 nmol/L scrambled siRNA did not enhance the cellular sensitivity
of ABT-737, suggesting that the increased sensitivity was specific to

observed in both H196 and DMS114 cells transfected with Mcl-1,
but not scramble, siRNA relative to each cell lines scramble
controls (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the cell viability dose-response
data (Fig. 4C), the induction of apoptosis was greater in DMS114
cells as compared with H196 cells, following Mcl-1 siRNA
transfection alone and in combination with ABT-737.
Noxa overexpression sensitizes H196 cells to ABT-737. To
investigate the relationship between Noxa and cellular response to
ABT-737, we transfected H196 cells with a Noxa or control
expression vector, and cell viability was accessed following
treatment with or without 20 Amol/L ABT-737. Transfection with
the Noxa expression vector resulted in enhanced expression of
Noxa (Fig. 5A). The increased expression of either Noxa or ABT-737
treatment alone slightly reduced the viability of H196 cells.
However, the combination of both Noxa overexpression and ABT737 treatment decreased H196 viability by f50% to 60% as
compared with the nontransfected controls (Fig. 5B). The viability
of the control vector–transfected cells was similar to the
nontransfected controls, suggesting that the increased sensitivity

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (3). February 1, 2007

to ABT-737 was due to the expression of Noxa and not the
transfection conditions alone.
Synergy between carboplatin/etoposide and ABT-737
involves the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and concurrent upregulation of Puma, Noxa, and Bim in H196 cells. We evaluated
the effect of concurrent treatment of ABT-737 and carboplatin/
etoposide (kept at a fixed ratio of 2.5:1) in H196 cells. H196 viability
was f90% of untreated controls following treatment with 1.56
Amol/L ABT-737 and 70%, 60%, and 40% following treatment with
4.7:1.9, 9.4:3.8, or 75:30 Amol/L carboplatin/etoposide, respectively,
for 72 h (Fig. 6A). In contrast, cell viability following concurrent
treatment with 4.7:1.9, 9.4:3.8, or 75:30 Amol/L carboplatin/etoposide with 1.56 Amol/L ABT-737 was 40%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. The CI as described by Chou and Talalay (38) was used to
quantitatively assess the effect of the drug-combination treatment
where the ratio of carboplatin, etoposide, and ABT-737 was kept
at a fixed ratio of 48:19:1, respectively. The CI values between the
dose-effect levels 0.50 to 0.90 were <0.3, indicating that the
combination of carboplatin/etoposide and ABT-737 was strongly
synergistic (Fig. 6B).

Factors Influencing SCLC Sensitivity to ABT-737

To determine if Mcl-1 played a role in the synergism observed
with ABT-737/carboplatin/etoposide treatment, H196 cells were
treated with carboplatin/etoposide at 100:40 Amol/L over a
24-h period. Carboplatin/etoposide treatment alone resulted in a
decrease in Mcl-1 levels by 60% after 24 h (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
Noxa, Puma, and Bim increased following carboplatin/etoposide
treatment. Both Bim and Puma levels increased by 150% and 230%,
respectively, 24 h after treatment. On the other hand, Noxa levels
increased transiently by 74% at 6 h, as compared with untreated
controls, and then decreased by 24 h (Fig. 6C). Over the course of
24 h, there was also a slight stabilization of p53, which is known to
directly regulate Noxa and Puma (39). Quantitative PCR analysis of
H196 cells treated with carboplatin/etoposide confirmed that both
Noxa and Puma mRNA expression levels increased significantly
within 4 h of treatment, indicating that the increase in protein levels
was due to regulation at the transcript level (data not shown).

Discussion
Based on the expression studies in naı̈ve SCLC cell lines, we show
that higher levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bim, and Noxa and lower levels of

Mcl-1 characterize SCLC cell lines sensitive to ABT-737. The converse
was true in the ABT-737–resistant H146 cells following chronic
exposure to ABT-737. Here we observed a progressive decrease in
the relative levels of Bcl-2 and Noxa and an increase in the relative
levels of Mcl-1 with increasing resistance to ABT-737 in H146 cells.
The fact that we observed similar changes in the relative levels of
Bcl-2 family members in naı̈ve and ABT-737–resistant H146 cells
suggests that these changes play an important role in SCLC survival
and response to ABT-737. The apparent association of Mcl-1 protein
levels with increased resistance to ABT-737 and higher levels of
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in sensitive cell lines is consistent with the specificity
profile of ABT-737 because it binds tightly to the antiapoptotic
members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL but not Mcl-1 (35).
To evaluate the mechanistic contribution of Bcl-2 family
members to the cellular response to ABT-737, we used both
molecular and chemical approaches. We found that Mcl-1
knockdown sensitized SCLC cells to ABT-737 treatment by
enhancing ABT-737–induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 knockdown seems
to contribute to ABT-737 sensitivity by lowering the apoptotic
threshold which is consistent with previous reports that show Mcl1 and Bcl-XL both are potent inhibitors of apoptosis by inhibiting
Bak activation (13, 20). The enhanced apoptosis when ABT-737 was
used in combination with Mcl-1 knockdown indicates further that
Mcl-1 is an important regulator of apoptosis, and that the
combination of ABT-737 with other treatment therapies that
modulate Mcl-1 has potential utility in SCLC malignancies.
Of interest, we observed that there was an increase in apoptosis
in DMS114 cells following Mcl-1 knockdown alone. This is
consistent with the idea that some cells are ‘‘primed for death,’’
and that they are dependent or ‘‘addicted’’ to certain Bcl-2 family
members for survival (40). In this case, Mcl-1 would seem to play a
crucial role in DMS114 cell survival, and inhibition of other
antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL can further enhance cell
death. Thus, Mcl-1 may play a critical role in SCLC drug resistance
to ABT-737 by functionally compensating for other Bcl-2 antiapoptotic family members.
Here, we show that up-regulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa
increased the sensitivity of H196 cells to ABT-737. The BH3-only
proteins act as molecular sensors of cellular stress or damage, and
they are activated to initiate apoptosis by modulating the activity
of the other Bcl-2 family members (17–22). Recently, Noxa has been
shown to specifically bind to Mcl-1 and A-1 but not Bcl-2, Bcl-XL,
or Bcl-w (19). This highly specific interaction of Noxa for Mcl-1
suggests that it is a key regulator of Mcl-1. This was shown
previously in transformed mouse embryo fibroblast cells where
overexpression of Noxa was shown to promote Mcl-1 but not
Bcl-XL degradation and promote the release of proapoptotic Bak
from Mcl-1 (20). Furthermore, it was shown that Bak binds to both
Bcl-XL and Mcl-1, and that a loss of Bcl-XL sensitized mouse
embryo fibroblasts to Noxa-induced killing (20). Coincidentally, we
observed higher Noxa levels in cell lines sensitive to ABT-737, and
ectopic expression of Noxa in a resistant cell line increased their
sensitivity to ABT-737. This suggests that Noxa may play an
important role in governing the cellular response of SCLC cells to
ABT-737, in part by neutralizing Mcl-1 in SCLC cells.
Carboplatin, cisplatin, and etoposide are cytotoxic agents that
interfere with the DNA replication process during S phase and
elicit a DNA damage response that causes cells to arrest and
undergo apoptosis (41, 42). In cells containing wild-type p53, p53
induces the transcriptional up-regulation of several proapoptotic
genes including BAX, PUMA, and NOXA (39). Here, we show that

combination treatment with carboplatin/etoposide and ABT-737
was extremely synergistic (CI < 0.3). This was associated with the
down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the concerted up-regulation of
multiple BH3-only proteins Noxa, Puma, and Bim. Noxa, Puma,
and Bim have been shown to be potent inducers of apoptosis
(13, 17, 19). Unlike Noxa, however, Puma and Bim bind with high
affinity to all of the multidomain antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members (19). Thus, ABT-737 synergism with carboplatin/etoposide may involve in part the combined activities of BH3-only
proteins to neutralize the prosurvival activity of Mcl-1, together
with the inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL by ABT-737. This suggests that
the chemotherapeutics that neutralize Mcl-1 either directly or
indirectly by modulating key factors that regulate it will enhance
the activity of ABT-737.
Thus, a balance between antiapoptotic and proapoptotic
proteins seems to govern the cellular response of SCLC cells to
ABT-737. Presumably, the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic death
signals necessitates the expression of one or more antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members for SCLC survival. In SCLC cell lines sensitive
to ABT-737, the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and, to a lesser extent,
Mcl-1 governs cell survival. In SCLC cell lines resistant to ABT-737,
elevated Mcl-1 expression seems to compensate for the decreased
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Lower expression levels of Noxa in
resistant cell lines would further increase the antiapoptotic potency

of Mcl-1. Similarly, lower levels of Puma and Bim would also
increase the antiapoptotic potency of all prosurvival members.
Overall, these data suggest that cell dependence on Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL for survival is requisite for cellular sensitivity to ABT-737,
and their absence is indicative of resistance in SCLC cell lines.
Conversely, the presence of Mcl-1 alone does not necessarily signify
resistance; however, higher Mcl-1 expression may be one mechanism by which resistance can occur.
In summary, these findings provide compelling evidence that
certain Bcl-2 family members play a role in the cellular response of
SCLC cell lines to ABT-737. In a broader context, our results
provide information that may be useful in the development of
biomarkers for the stratification of SCLC patients and the design of
better rational-based combination therapies for clinical trials. In
addition, they provide further insight into the relative contribution
and interaction of Bcl-2 family members in regulating apoptosis in
SCLC that may lead to the design of more effective targeted
therapies in the future.
