ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence indicates that the dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) contributes to the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma
(LAD), however the underlying mechanism of action of lncRNAs remains unclear.
It is well known that the effective treatment of cancers has been hindered by drug
resistance in the clinical setting. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been
recognized to be involved in acquiring drug resistance, cell migration and invasion
properties in several types of cancer. Docetaxel-resistant LAD cells established
previously in our lab present chemoresistant and mesenchymal features. Long
intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR), was first
discovered in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and was upregulated in docetaxelresistant LAD cells. In this study, we tried to make clarification of lincRNA-related
mechanisms underlying EMT followed by acquired resistance to chemotherapy in
LAD. In order to hit the mark, we made use of multiple methods including microarray
analysis, qRT-PCR, western blotting analysis, loss/gain-of-function analysis, luciferase
assays, drug sensitivity assays, wound-healing assay and invasion assay. We found
that decreased expression of linc-ROR effectively reversed EMT in docetaxel-resistant
LAD cells and sensitized them to chemotherapy. The function of linc-ROR exerted in
LAD cells depended on the sponging of miR-145, therefore, releasing the miR-145
target FSCN1, and thus contributing to the acquisition of chemoresistance and EMT
phenotypes of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. Our findings revealed that linc-ROR might
act as potential therapeutic target to overcome chemotherapy resistance in LAD.

INTRODUCTION

close relationship between chemoresistance and EMT
process in cancer [5]. EMT is an important process that
plays significant roles in embryonic development, cancers
and other diseases [5–7]. This process is characterized
by loss of their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion, and
the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties [8].
Therefore, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies
to improve drug resistance, it is extremely important and
necessary to determine the mechanisms that connect EMT
and the development of drug resistance.
Linc-ROR, firstly reported by Loewer et al in
2010, was described as a 2.6 kb lncRNA and functions
in promoting the reprogramming in iPSC [9]. Linc-

Lung cancer is the disease with the highest morbidity
and mortality in malignant tumors [1]. Non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of all lung
cancers and among NSCLC, LAD is the most common
type [2]. Despite the development of cancer treatment and
introduction of new technology, the poor prognosis is still
a severe problem in advanced lung cancer. Docetaxel is a
chemotherapy medication used to treated many types of
cancers, including advanced NSCLC [3]. However, LAD
exhibits a high resistance to chemotherapy and recurrence
is virtually assured [4]. Emerging evidence indicates a

ROR is located at 18q21.31 and contains the elements of
LINE, SINE and LTR [10]. Reports have been confirmed
that elevated linc-ROR contributes to the oncogenesis
and development of many types of cancers including
hepatocellular cancer, breast cancer and endometrial
cancer [11–13]. However, linc-ROR and its target genes
involved in chemoresistance and EMT are still not fully
understood in LAD.
In this study, we identify the function of linc-ROR
in regulating chemoresistance and EMT process in LAD
cells. Compared with parental control cells (SPC-A1 and
H1299), we found out that linc-ROR was upregulated
in docetaxel-resistance LAD cells (SPC-A1/DTX and
H1299/DTX). Down regulation of linc-ROR reversed
the chemoresistance and EMT features of these cells by
targeting miR-145 and its target gene FSCN1. Our novel
findings provide a potential target for the treatment of
chemoresistant LAD patients.

was significantly upregulated in the stable overexpression
cell line and downregulated in the stable knockdown cell
lines by four different short hairpin RNA, sh-ROR-3
produced the greatest reduction in endogenous linc-ROR
expression (Figure 1A). MTT assays were performed to
test the effect of linc-ROR on the IC50 value of docetaxel
in LAD cell lines. Compared with control cells, the IC50
value of docetaxel in SPC-A1 / ROR or H1299/ ROR
increased significantly (Figure 1B, p < 0.01). Conversely,
the IC50 value of docetaxel for the SPC-A1/DTX/shROR
or H1299/DTX/shROR cells was reduced compared
with control cells (Figure 1B, p < 0.01). This result
demonstrated that the linc-ROR can enhance the resistance
of docetaxel in LAD. We obtained similar results from
the colony formation assay that the ability to form
colonies was significantly enhanced following linc-ROR
overexpression in SPC-A1/ROR cells and H1299/ROR
cells when exposed to different concentration docetaxel,
and greatly decreased in linc-ROR knockdown SPC-A1/
DTX/shROR and H1299/DTX/shROR cells to different
concentration docetaxel, indicating the function of lincROR in proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Figure 1A).
To further demonstrate the mechanism by which ectopic
linc-ROR expression facilitated cell proliferation, we
performed flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and cell
cycle. As showed in Figure 1C, 1D and Supplementary
Figure 1B, compare with negative controls, after exposure
to 0 or 10 µg/L docetaxel for 24 hours, SPC-A1/ROR or
H1299/ROR showed stronger resistance to docetaxelinduced apoptosis while SPC-A1/DTX/shROR or H1299/
DTX/shROR had high apoptosis rate when exposed
to docetaxel (0 µg/L, 50 µg/L, or 100 µg/L, p < 0.05).
Knockdown of linc-ROR also induces cell percentage
increase of G2/M phase, and decreases of S phase in DTXresistant LAD cells (Figure 1F, Supplementary Figure 1C).
Contrarily, overexpression of linc-ROR induces cell
percentage decrease of G2/M phase and increase of S
phase in parental LAD cells (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure 1C). Taken together, these data recommended that
linc-ROR could enhance the capacity of proliferation and
chemotherapy resistance in LAD cells.

RESULTS
linc-ROR is upregulated in docetaxel-resistant
LAD cell lines
To identify the possible RNA expression changes
in docetaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cells,
the mixture A, which was composed of SPC-A1 and
H1299 at the same size radio, and the mixture B, which
was composed of SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX at the
same size radio, were generated. Then a gene chip study
was performed in these two mixtures. Compared to
mixture A, the expression of linc-ROR was significantly
upregulated in mixture B (Supplementary Figure 1D and
Supplementary Table 1). QRT-PCR assays were further
developed to quantify linc-ROR in two docetaxel-resistant
LAD cell lines (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX) and the
corresponding parental cell lines (SPC-A1 and H1299).
A significant high expression of linc-ROR was found in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cell lines compared with the
parental cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1D). These
results indicated that linc-ROR might contribute to the
chemoresistance phenotype of LAD cells.

Expression of linc-ROR is associated to
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of
docetaxelresistant LAD cells

Expression of linc-ROR influences cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and docetaxel sensitivity
of LAD in vitro

EMT process confers invasive capacity, apoptosis,
and drug resistance to the transformed epithelial cells
[14]. As shown in Figure 2A, upregulation of lincROR in SPC-A1 and H1299 cells leaded to a fibroblastlike morphology, which is typical of the mesenchymal
phenotype of cells associated with the loss of epithelial
markers compared with the corresponding control
groups. To identify whether silencing of linc-ROR could
abolish the invasiveness and metastasis of lung cancer
cells via going through abolishing the EMT process, we

To investigate the potential effects of linc-ROR
on chemoresistance of LAD, we infected SPC-A1 and
H1299 cells with lentivirus to generate cell lines that
stably expressed the empty vector and full-length lincROR. Meanwhile, SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX cells
were infected by lentivirus to generate cell lines that stably
knock down of linc-ROR and control cells. QRT-PCR
was used to test the efficiency of linc-ROR manipulation.

detected the biomarkers of EMT by western blotting
and immunofluorescent staining in SPC-A1 (or H1299)
and SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) cells in response to
different levels of linc-ROR. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 2A, forced expression of linc-ROR reduced the
expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin, which are the
characteristic biomarkers of epithelial cells, and increased
the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin, indicating
the display of mesenchymal phenotype. Conversely,
downregulation of linc-ROR increased the levels of
epithelial markers and decreased the levels of mesenchymal
markers (Supplementary Figure 2A). Moreover, results
obtained from immunofluorescence studies showed a
similar change in marker expression (Figure 2B and
Supplementary Figure 2B). Furthermore, both transwell
and “wound healing” assays showed increased invasion and
migration activity of parental LAD cells in the presence of
linc-ROR, but remarkably reduced invasion and migration

activity in the absence of linc-ROR in SPC-A1/DTX
(or H1299/DTX) cells (Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure 3A, 3B). These observations led to the hypothesis
that the expression of linc-ROR may be correlated with the
EMT in tumor cells.

Inhibition of linc-ROR sensitizes LAD to DTX
in vivo
To investigate the effect of linc-ROR knockdown
on DTX-resistant LAD cells in vivo, SPC-A1/DTX and
H1299/DTX cells with stable transfection of sh-ROR
were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice. Two
weeks later all tumors were separated after the treatment
with 1 mg/kg DTX, which were intraperitoneally injected
into the nude mice. With the treatment of DTX, the tumor
volume formatted by SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/DTX
cells transfected with sh-ROR was lighter or smaller than

Linc-ROR regulates expression of miR-145 to
induce resistance of LAD cells to DTX and EMT

control (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 1E). QRT-PCR
was performed to test the expression of linc-ROR in four
groups, results shows that groups transfected with sh-ROR
have significantly lower levels of linc-ROR compared to
control groups (Figure 3B). Hematoxylin and eosin staining
was performed to confirm xenograft tumor morphology,
and immunohistochemical staining was performed to show
the decreased positive rates of proliferation markers ki-67
and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Figure 3C).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining showed more cell apoptosis
in tumors with linc-ROR knockdown (Figure 3D).
Furthermore, we also performed immunohistochemical
to detect the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal
markers and two important actors of EMT, ZEB1 and
ZEB2, in subcutaneous tumors formed from cells
transfected with sh-ROR. As shown in Figure 3E, the levels
of epithelial protein markers were increased, while those of
mesenchymal markers, ZEB1 and ZEB2 were decreased,
compared with control groups. These results indicated
that the downregulation of linc-ROR sensitizes docetaxelresistant LAD cells to docetaxel treatment and abolishes
the invasiveness and metastasis of them.

Reports have suggested that linc-ROR can
function as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and
overexpression of it may reverse the negative regulation
between miRNAs and their target genes. Related miRNAs
consist of miR-145, miR-205 and miR-133 [11, 13, 15–19].
In this study, qRT-PCR was performed to compare the
expression of miR-145, miR-205 and miR-133 in linc-ROR
downregulated and upregulated LAD cells, results showed
that all of them can be regulated by linc-ROR, especially
miR-145 (Figure 4A). We also tested the expression of
miR-145 in LAD cells by qRT-PCR, as shown in Figure 4B,
expression of miR-145 sharply decreased in docetaxelresistant LAD cells. Additionally, there was no difference
in linc-ROR levels after ectopic expression or knockdown
of miR-145 (Figure 4C). To further validate the regulatory
relationship between linc-ROR and miR-145, we performed
an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay that revealed a
competitive relationship between linc-ROR and miR-145
(Figure 4D). The results of luciferase reporter assays
provided further confirmation. As shown in Figure 4E,

miR-145 as a direct downstream target of linc-ROR.

cells are lower than control (Figure 5B). On the other
hand, the IC50 value for DTX in SPC-A1 (or H1299)
cells transfected with miR-145 inhibitor was higher than
control, respectively (Figure 5B). Colony formation assay
showed that the proliferation ability of DTX-resistant cells
with overexpressed miR-145 diminished significantly and
the opposite effect for SPC-A1 (or H1299) transfected
with miR-145 inhibitor (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Moreover, overexpression of miR-145 induced more
cell apoptosis and caused increase of S phase and G2/M
phase arrest in cell cycle distribution (Figure 5C, 5D and
Supplementary Figure 1B, 1C). Additionally, western blot
analysis and immunofluorescence studies were performed
to investigate the function of miR-145 on the induction of
EMT in LAD cells. The expression of epithelial markers
was decreased while that of mesenchymal markers was
increased following transfection of miR-145 inhibitor into

The oncogenic function of linc-ROR in LAD cells
in vitro is dependent on miR-145

SPC-A1 (or H1299 cells) (Figure 5F and Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B). The opposite results were obtained for
SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) transfected with miR-145
mimics (Figure 5F and Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B).
Furthermore, both transwell invasion and “wound healing”
assays showed a significant increase in the invasive capacity
of SPC-A1 (or H1299) cells in the presence of miR-145
inhibitor (Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B).
In contrast, the opposite results were obtained for SPC-A1/
DTX (or H1299/DTX) cells treated with miR-145 mimics
(Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B).
All these results strongly suggest that limited
expression of miR-145 might contribute to the therapeutic
resistance and EMT transition, thereby promoting the
oncogenic function of linc-ROR in LAD cells.

To investigate whether linc-ROR influenced LAD
cell proliferation, apoptosis, and EMT process were
depended on miR-145, we performed rescue experiments
including MTT assays, colony formation assays, flow
cytometry assays, wound healing assays and transwell
assays. MiR-NC or miR-145 inhibitor were transfected into
SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) cells stably transfected
with sh-control or sh-ROR, and miR-NC or miR-145
mimics were transfected into SPC-A1 (or H1299) cells
stably transfected with linc-ROR. Cotransfection could
partially rescue promotion of colony formation capacity
and the decreased chemosensitivity of docetaxelresistant

LAD cells induced by linc-ROR (Figure 6A, 6B).
Furthermore, antiapoptotic effect of linc-ROR could be
partially reversed by the introduction of miR-145 mimics
into SPC-A1 (or H1299) cells treated with docetaxel, and
a similar antiapoptotic effect after exposure to docetaxel
(0 μg/L, 50 μg/L, or 100 μg/L) was also observed after
co-transfection of sh-ROR and miR-145 inhibitors into
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells (Figure 6C). Additionally,
transwells assays and “wound healing” assays showed
that the pro-metastasis and invasive effect of linc-ROR
in SPC-A1 (or H1299) cells could be partly abolished by
cotransfection with miR-145 mimics, whereas the antimetastasis effect induced by sh-ROR in SPC-A1/DTX (or
H1299/ DTX) cells could be partially reversed by miR145 inhibitors (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 3C).
Taken together, restoration of miR-145 can partially rescue
the phenotypic changes, including proliferation, apoptosis,
docetaxel chemosensitivity, and the induction of the EMT
phenotype, in docetaxel-transfected LAD cells, which
were induced by linc-ROR, further suggesting that lincROR functions in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, at least
by part, by downregulation of miR-145.

miR-145 might negatively regulate the expression of FSCN1
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells by post-translational
control.

Roles of FSCN1 in formation of chemoresistance
and EMT phenotype in docetaxel-resistant LAD
cells induced by downregulation of miR-145
To explore the biologic functions of FSCN1 in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, 4 siRNAs (sh-FSCN1-1-4)
were used to knockdown endogenous FSCN1 expression,
we chose sh-FSCN1-2 for the following experiments, and
FSCN1 plasmid was used to upregulate the expression
of FSCN1 in parental cells (Figure 8A). FSCN1
downregulation could lead to the decreased IC50 values
of SPC-A1/DTX or H1299/DTX cells, respectively
(Figure 8B). On the other hand, IC50 value for docetaxel
in SPC-A1 (or H1299) cells transfected with FSNC1 was
increased compared with NC group (Figure 8B). Also,
FSCN1 downregulation resulted in the decreased colony
formation capacity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells
whereas upregulation of FSCN1 leads to the increased
colony capacity of parental LAD cells (Supplementary
Figure 1A). Moreover, overexpression of FSCN1 induced
less cell apoptosis while downregulation of FSCN1 leads
to more cell apoptosis (Figure 8C and Supplementary
Figure 1B). The effects of FSCN1 on expression of EMTrelated molecular markers were then determined by western
blot analysis and immunofluorescence studies. Forced
expression of FSCN1 reduced the expression of epithelial
markers and increased the expression of mesenchymal
markers (Figure 8E and Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B).
Conversely, downregulation of FSCN1 increased the
levels of epithelial markers and decreased the levels of
mesenchymal markers (Figure 8E and Supplementary
Figure 2A, 2B). Cell migration/invasion assays revealed a
facilitating effect of FSCN1 on metastasis of parental LAD
cells (Figure 8D and Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B). In
contrast, SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) cells transfected
with sh-FSCN1 showed relatively low migration and
invasion capability compared with negative control groups
(Figure 8D and Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B). Generally,
we demonstrated negative regulation in miR-145 by lincROR, which contributes to chemoresistance and EMT
phenotype of LAD by regulating FSCN1 expression.

FSCN1 is a functional target of miR-145
Potential targets of miR-145 were analyzed and
chosen by employing open access online miRNA target
databases. Fascins (FSCNs) are 55-kDa globular proteins
composed of four tandem FSCN domains, each of which
corresponds structurally to a β-trefoil fold [20]. FSCN1,
a member of the FSCN family of actin‑binding proteins,
has an important role in cell proliferation, migration and
invasion in various types of cancer and was identified as a
predictable downstream target of miR-145 [21, 22]. FSCN1
expression was tested in SPC-A1 and SPC-A1/DTX cells.
The results showed that both mRNA and protein level
of FSCN1 are higher in SPC-A1/DTX than in SPC-A1
(Figure 7A). To examine the inhibitory effect of miR-145
on FSCN1 mRNA and protein levels, we conducted
qRT-PCR assay and Western blotting at 48 hours after
transfected with miR-145 inhibitor or miR-145 mimics
into SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) or SPC-A1 (or
H1299) cells. Overexpression of miR-145 significantly
decreased the expression level of FSCN1 protein in
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, whereas downregulation of
miR145 led to the increased expression level of FSCN1
protein in parental cells, but miR-145 has no influence on
the mRNA levels of FSCN1 (Figure 7B). Then, as shown
in Figure  8C, the 3′-UTR of FSCN1 is complementary
binding site for miR-145. Luciferase reporter containing
amplified FSCN1 3′-UTR segment with or without mutated
the miR-145 potential binding site were respectively
transfected into SPCA1/DTX cells overexpressed
miR-145. The results show that overexpression of miR-145
could inhibit the activity of luciferase that carried wildtype but not mutant 3′-UTR of FSCN1 (Figure 7C). Thus,

DISCUSSION
Accumulating evidence suggests that the majority of
lncRNAs are biologically relevant [23]. And dysregulation
of lncRNAs has also been shown to contribute to cancer
pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic opportunities to
treat cancer [24]. However, the roles of lncRNAs in LAD
carcinogenesis are not well understood. Chemoresistance
is one of the main obstacles in the clinical treatment of
patients diagnosed with LAD. Moreover, the emergence

investigating the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance
and the EMT phenotype in LAD might facilitate the
development of novel treatments that improve the patient
prognosis.

It is reported that EMT process plays a vital role
in promoting drug resistance, recurrence and metastasis
during the course of tumor treatment [25]. So far,
few reports have revealed that EMT transition also
contributes to therapeutic resistance in lung cancer. Sato

H et al. hypothesized that the miR-200c might serve as a
therapeutic target for EMT-related EGFR-TKI resistance
in lung cancer [26]. Ye and his colleagues reported that
the EMT process could be inhibited by the restoration
of miR-101 in NSCLC cells, finally leading to the
increasing sensitivity to cisplatin in lung cancer [27].
Also, it’s reported that miR-181a is associated with EMT
progression and chemoresistance in lung adenocarcinoma,
potentially through targeting of PTEN [28]. In line with
these reports, in the present study, we showed that there
is a similarity between morphological characteristics
of docetaxel-resistant cells and EMT features, which
include the decreased epithelial markers (E-cadherin
and β-catenin) and increased mesenchymal markers
(N-cadherin and Vimentin) [29]. However, the molecular
mechanisms accounting for acquisition of EMT phenotype
in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells remain largely unclear
and need to be further elucidated.
NcRNAs, including miRNAs, have been shown
to promote tumorigenesis [30, 31]. Several studies have
implicated the involvement of lncRNA in neurological
disease and oncogenesis [32]. It is suggested that lncRNA

may act as ceRNA to suppress the biological functions of
miRNAs [33–35]. Similar to those reports, overexpression
of linc-ROR can reverse the negative regulation between
miRNAs and their target genes [36]. Linc-ROR is reported
to stimulate EMT process by acting as a ceRNA for miR-205
in breast cancer cells [16]. Furthermore, Wang et al. found
that linc-ROR enhanced the expression of Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog by sponging the differentiation-related miRNAs in
hESCs especially miR-145 [9, 15]. Although linc-ROR has
been reported in a few types of cancers, but the roles of
it in LAD carcinogenesis are still not understood. In our
study, we compared the expression of miR-145, miR-205
and miR-133 in linc-ROR downregulated and upregulated
LAD cells, results showed that miR-145 changed most
among three miRNAs. MiR-145 is hypothesized to be
a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in various
types of cancers, including breast cancer and lung cancer
[37, 38]. Therefore we hypothesized that linc-ROR might
function in LAD in a miR-145-dependent manner. To test
this hypothesis, we performed RIP and luciferase reporter
assays to confirm the association between linc-ROR
and miR-145. Then, basing on our several experimental

results, we further confirmed the importance of linc-ROR
and miR-145 in mediating chemotherapy resistance and
EMT phenotype in LAD cells. Also, potential targets of
miR-145 were analyzed and chosen by employing open

access online miRNA target databases. FSCN1 was
identified as a predictable downstream target of miR-145.
It is reported that FSCN1 protein can locate in the plasma
membrane and thus promotes cell motility [39]. It has

also been well established that FSCN1 can increase the
capacities of cellular interactions, cell adhesion motility
and proliferation [20, 40]. There is evidence that miR-145
could inhibit tumor cell proliferation, invasion and
metastasis by targeting FSCN1 [41–45]. In our study,
we also confirmed that FSCN1 functions as a miR-145
target and it contributes to the chemoresistance and EMT
phenotype in docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.
Taken together, we first identified that dysregulation
of linc-ROR/miR-145/FSCN1 signalling pathway was
associated with therapeutic resistance and EMT transition
in LAD cells. In our study, the inhibited expression of
linc-ROR could not only increase sensitivity to docetaxel
and reverse EMT process, but also reduce the capacity
of proliferation, migration and invasion in docetaxelresistant LAD cells. MiR-145 was identified as a direct
target of linc-ROR, and overexpression of miR-145
would lead to the downregulation of its target gene
FSCN1. This newly identified linc-ROR/miR-145/FSCN1
axis provides potential therapeutic strategies for drug
resistance in LAD patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell transfection

Cell lines

The cDNA encoding linc-ROR was PCR-amplified
and subcloned into the pLenti-GIII-CMV-Puro vector
(ABM, Canada), which was named as ROR. The shRNA specifically targeting linc-ROR were synthesized
by ABM (Canada). The sh-RNA sequence for lincROR were sh-ROR-1, 5′-GCCTCTGCACTCTTATGG
AAGGAGGAAAT-3′, sh-ROR-2, 5′-AGAGTGAAAGTC
CCAGGGCATGTGGGAAT-3′, sh-ROR-3, 5′-GGTGAG
AAACCCATTGTTCAGTTCCCTAA-3′, sh-ROR-4, 5′-A
CTGAGTTGATGATGGAACAGTAGAGTGG-3′.
For FSCN1 functional analysis, cells were
transfected with FSCN1‑specific small interfering (sh)RNA
(ABM, Canada) or pcDNA3.1‑FSCN1 plasmids (ABM,
Canada). The sh-RNA sequence for FSCN1 were shFSCN1-1, 5′-CGAGGACCGCCTGTCCTGCTTCGCGC

GGAGTTCCGCTCCGGCAAGGTGGCCTT-3′.
Transfections were performed using the
Lipofectamine 2000 kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Hsa-miRNA-145 mimic/
negative control mimic and hsa-miRNA-145 inhibitor/
negative control inhibitor were purchased from Applied
Biological Materials (ABM, Canada).

Two human LAD cell lines SPC-A1 and H1299
were purchased from the Tumor Cell Bank of Chinese
Academy of Medical Science (Shanghai, China) and
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and ampicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The
docetaxel-resistant LAD cells (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX) derived from parental SPC-A1 and H1299 cells,
respectively, were established and preserved in 50 ug/L
final concentration of docetaxel.

LncRNA microarray analysis
LncRNA microarray analysis was done in the
parental mixture A (SPC-A1 and H1299) and doxcetaxelresistant cell lines mixture B (SPC-A1/DTX and H1299/
DTX). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus
(TAKARA, Japan) and the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Depending
on the Agilent Human lncRNA 4 * 180 genechip from
Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation, linc-ROR was
selected, whose expression levels between the mixture A
and mixture B differed by 9.05-fold.

containing desired vector, and screened with Puromycin
(2 μg/ml) for four weeks.

Cells seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates
were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution and permeabilized
with 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS. Cells were blocked with
5% BSAPBS for 1 h at room temperature and incubated
with primary antibody at 4°C overnight, followed by
incubation with fluorescent-dye conjugated secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h, and then stained with DAPI.
Finally, images were taken under an inverted fluorescence
microscope.

luciferase reporter assay
pmirGLO, pmirGLO-RORwt or pmirGLORORmut (miR-145) was co-transfected with miR-145 mimics
or miRNA NC into SPC-A1 cells by Lipofectaminemediated gene transfer. The relative luciferase activity
was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity 48 h after
transfection. The data were relative to the fold change of
the corresponding control groups defined as 1.0.

Western bolt analysis and antibodies

In vitro chemosensitivity assay

Total protein lysates were separated in 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE), and were electrophoretically transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche).
Protein loading was estimated using mouse anti-GAPDH
monoclonal antibody. The membranes were blotted with
10% non-fat milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature,
washed and then probed with the rabbit anti-human
E-cadherin (1: 2000 dilution), β-catenin (1: 2000 dilution),
N-cadherin (1: 2000 dilution), vimentin (1: 2000 dilution),
FSCN1 (1:2000 dilution) and GAPDH (1: 3000 dilution),
overnight at 4°C, followed by treatment with secondary
antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at
room temperature. The proteins were detected using an
enhanced chemiluminescence system and exposed to x-ray
film. All antibodies were purchased from Abcam (USA).

Chemosensitivity was measured by 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide
(MTT, Sigma, USA) assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well
plates treated with docetaxel. After 48 h, the MTT solution
(5 mg/ml, 20 μl) was added to each well. Following
incubation for 4 h, the media was removed and 100 μl
DMSO were added to each well. The relative number of
surviving cells was assessed by measuring the optical
density (O.D.) of cell lysates at 560 nm. All assays were
performed in triplicate.

Colony formation assay
Cells (500 cells/ well) were plated in 6-well plates
and incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS at 37°C. Two
weeks later, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1%
crystal violet. The number of visible colonies was counted
manually.

RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)

Apoptosis assays and cell cycle assays by flow
cytometric analysis were described previously. 23 An
annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis
detection kit and cell cycle detection kit (KeyGEN
Biotech, Nanjing, China) was used to inspect apoptosis
process and cell cycle distribution in triplicate according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA immunoprecipitation was performed using
thermo fisher RIP kit (Thermo, USA) based on the
manufacturer’s protocol. The Ago2 antibodies were
purchased from Abcam (USA). Normal mouse IgG
(Abcam, USA) was applied as negative control and antiSNRNP70 (Abcam, USA) was employed as positive control
for the RIP procedure. Purified RNA was subjected to qRTPCR analysis to demonstrate the presence of the binding
targets using respective primers.

Cell migration and invasion assays

Xenograft transplantation assays

Cell migration and invasion were measured by
transwell chamber (8 um pore size, Corning) and Matrigel
invasion (Bection Dickinson), respectively. Forty-eight
hour after transfection, cells in serum-free media were
placed into the upper chamber coated with or without
10 μg/ml Matrigel. Media containing 10% FBS was added
into the lower chamber. Following 48 h incubation, cells
remaining in upper membrane were wiped off, while cells
that migrated or invaded were fixed in methanol, stained
with 0.1% crystal violet and counted under a microscope.
Three independent experiments were carried out.

All female athymic BALB/c nude mice (4–6 week
old) were purchased from the Comparative Medicine
Department (Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China). The
animal study has been ethically approved and performed
according to the institutional guidelines. Subcutaneous
xenografts model were established by subcutaneously
injecting 2 × 106 SPC-A1/DTX (or H1299/DTX) directly
or stable transfected with sh-ROR or sh-control (n = 6
mice/group). Tumor growth was under surveillance and
tumor volumes were calculated with equation. All mice
were sacrificed about 8 weeks later.
