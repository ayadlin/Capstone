Abstract

Author Manuscript

Fas ligand (FasL), an apoptosis-inducing member of the TNF cytokine family and its receptor,
Fas, are critical for shutdown of chronic immune responses1-3 and prevention of
autoimmunity4,5. Accordingly, mutations in their genes cause severe lymphadenopathy and
autoimmune disease in mice6,7 and humans8,9. FasL function is regulated by deposition in the
plasma membrane and metalloprotease-mediated shedding10,11. We generated gene-targeted
mice that selectively lack either secreted FasL (ΔsFasL) or membrane-bound FasL (ΔmFasL) to
resolve which of these forms is required for cell killing and to explore their hypothetical nonapoptotic activities. Mice lacking sFasL (FasLΔs/Δs) appeared normal and their T cells readily
killed target cells, whereas T cells lacking mFasL (FasLΔm/Δm) could not kill cells through Fas
activation. FasLΔm/Δm mice developed lymphadenopathy and hyper-gammaglobulinaemia, similar
to FasLgld/gld mice, which express a mutant form of FasL that cannot bind Fas, but surprisingly,
(on a C57BL/6 background) FasLΔm/Δm mice succumbed to SLE-like autoimmune kidney
destruction and histiocytic sarcoma, diseases that occur only rarely and considerably later in
FasLgld/gld mice. These results demonstrate that mFasL is essential for cytotoxic activity and
constitutes the guardian against lymphadenopathy, autoimmunity and cancer whereas excess
sFasL appears to promote autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through non-apoptotic activities.

Although Fas-induced apoptosis is thought to require extensive aggregation of preassembled Fas trimers12-15, it has not been resolved whether mFasL, sFasL or both cause
cell killing when expressed physiologically 4,5. It is also debated whether either or both of
these forms of FasL may have non-apoptotic activities, such as induction of inflammatory
responses5,16,17. Indeed, sFasL is capable of activating the NF-κB pathway
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and 18,19). We sought to determine the physiological functions of
mFasL and sFasL by generating gene-targeted mice that cannot shed FasL but do express
membrane-bound FasL (FasLΔs/Δs) or conversely mice that lack membrane-bound FasL but
are capable of producing sFasL (FasLΔm/Δm). Studies using FasL over-expression in
transfected cell lines showed that the former can be accomplished, by mutating the
sequences in the fasl gene encoding the amino acids required for metalloprotease-mediated
cleavage12-14 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b,d). Conversely, the latter can be achieved
by replacing the sequences in the fasl gene encoding the trans-membrane and intra-cellular
regions of FasL with those encoding the signal peptide of the cytokine G-CSF12-14 (Fig. 1a,
Supplementary Fig. 2a,c,e).

To verify that the mutations had the intended consequences, we compared the expression
and subcellular localisation of FasL between mitogenically activated T lymphocytes from
FasLΔs/Δs, FasLΔm/Δm and wt mice. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic
analysis of fixed cells showed that intracellular localisation and levels of the FasLΔs and
FasLΔm mutant proteins were comparable to those of wt FasL (Fig. 1b). ELISA
demonstrated that mitogen-activated T cells from FasLΔm/Δm and wt mice contained
substantial levels of FasL in their supernatants whereas FasLΔs/Δs T cells had significantly
less (Fig. 1c). FasL in cellular supernatants can be found in two forms: secreted sFasL
derived by metalloprotease-mediated cleavage or mFasL present on vesicles that had been
shed by cells12. The latter can efficiently trigger Fas-mediated apoptosis in cultured cells12,
although the physiological relevance of this remains unclear. Regardless, FPLC and ultracentrifugation revealed that in contrast to FasL from supernatants of wt or FasLΔm/Δm T
cells, a substantial fraction of FasL in supernatants of FasLΔs/Δs T cells resided in
membranous fractions (Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, immunofluorescent cell surface
staining and FACS analysis identified significantly higher levels of membrane-bound FasL
on activated T cells from FasLΔs/Δs mice compared to wt T cells (Fig. 1d), consistent with
the notion that metalloprotease-mediated cleavage reduces the levels of mFasL11-14. As
expected, no FasL was detected on the surface of FasLΔm/Δm T cells (Fig. 1e). These results
verify that FasLΔs/Δs mice produce mFasL that cannot be shed by metalloproteases, whereas
FasLΔm/Δm mice lack mFasL but produce sFasL.
Since FasL contributes to the killing of virus-infected and other target cells4, we examined
which form is critical. We used mitogen-activated T cells from wt or the mutant fasl knockin mice as killers and the FasL sensitive CH1 mouse B lymphoma cells (Supplementary Fig.
4a,b) as targets. FasLΔs/Δs T cells killed CH1 cells with significantly higher efficiency than

wt T cells (Fig. 2a). In contrast, FasLΔm/Δm T cells possessed only poor cytotoxic activity,
comparable to those from FasL-deficient FasLgld/gld mice (Fig. 2b). FasL neutralisation
inhibited the cytotoxicity of wt and FasLΔs/Δs T cells but did not further reduce the poor
killing by FasLΔm/Δm or FasLgld/gld T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c-e), demonstrating that
only the former triggered a FasL/Fas-dependent apoptotic process. Restimulation of
activated T cells in vitro causes activation induced cell death (AICD), which is largely
dependent on FasL-mediated (paracrine and/or autocrine) Fas activation4. Stimulation with
mitogenic antibodies to CD3 triggered AICD in FasLΔs/Δs T cell blasts as efficiently as in wt
T cell blasts (Fig. 2c). In contrast, AICD was abnormally reduced in FasLΔm/Δm T cells,
indeed to a similar extent as seen with their FasLgld/gld counterparts (Fig. 2d). FasL
neutralisation significantly reduced AICD in wt and FasLΔs/Δs T cells but did not further
diminish the already reduced killing of FasLΔm/Δm or FasLgld/gld T cells (Supplementary
Fig. 5). This is consistent with the notion that AICD involves FasL/Fas-dependent as well as
-independent mechanisms4,20. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mFasL but not
sFasL is essential for Fas-induced killing of target cells and AICD and they indicate that
metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of mFasL reduces the cytotoxic activity of activated T
cells. This is consistent with certain findings with transfected cell lines over-expressing
FasL12-14 and the notion that apoptosis induction requires not only binding of FasL trimers
to pre-assembled Fas trimers but more extensive aggregation of Fas trimers12-15. This
contrasts with TNFα, which can kill TNF-R1+ target cells in both membrane-bound as well
as secreted form4,5.

Defects in AICD of mature T cells are thought to be the cause of the lymphadenopathy,
hyper-gammaglobulinaemia and autoimmunity in mice and humans deficient in FasL (e.g.
FasLgld/gld) or Fas (e.g. Faslpr/lpr)4. As reported21, by ∼100 days of age FasLgld/gld mice
(on an inbred C57BL/6 background) started to show signs of lymphadenopathy and
splenomegaly (Fig. 3a,b), including accumulation of large numbers of ‘unusual’ TCRα/
β+CD4-CD8-B220+ T cells (Fig. 3c,d). This was accompanied by hypergammaglobulinaemia (Fig. 3e) with high titers of anti-nuclear auto-antibodies (ANA, Fig.
3f,g). FasLΔm/Δm mice developed lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinaemia and ANA at a similar rate and extent as FasLgld/gld mice (Fig. 3).
Remarkably, however, the titres of anti-DNA auto-antibodies were significantly higher in
FasLΔm/Δm mice compared to FasLgld/gld mice (67% vs 14% symptomatic of SLE-like
disease (>12 IU/mL), p<0.05; Fig. 3h). In contrast, FasLΔs/Δs mice exhibited none of these
abnormalities and had a normal lifespan (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results show that
mFasL but not sFasL is essential for the killing of unwanted lymphocytes that is required to
prevent lymphadenopathy, hyper-gammaglobulinaemia and accumulation of autoantibodies.
FasLgld/gld mice express a mutated FasLgld protein (in membrane-bound and secreted form)
that is unable to bind to its receptor Fas7, whereas the secreted FasLΔm protein (like wt
sFasL) can bind to Fas (Supplementary Fig. 1 and12-14). If sFasL plays a role in
inflammation, for example through NF-κB activation (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 18,19), one
would expect significant differences in morbidity and mortality between FasLΔm/Δm and
FasLgld/gld mice. It was therefore remarkable that FasLΔm/Δm mice became sick significantly

earlier than FasLgld/gld mice (Fig. 4a, median latency 406 vs 658 days; p<0.0001). At
autopsy 62% of terminally ill FasLΔm/Δm mice showed signs of SLE-like autoimmune
disease, including cellular crescents, protein casts (Fig. 4b,c), deposition of IgM as well as
IgG antibodies and complement in renal glomeruli (Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast, such
pathologies were only rarely observed in FasLgld/gld mice, and then only at a considerably
older age and with less severity. Remarkably, by 400 days ∼50% of FasLΔm/Δm but only
∼15% of the FasLgld/gld mice had developed fatal SLE-like autoimmune kidney disease
(Fig. 4b).

By 5 months 46% of FasLΔm/Δm mice presented with very high (>3000 ng/mL) serum IgE
levels and ∼30% had developed severe dermatitis with lesions appearing on their ears and
necks (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). Although not previously reported, we observed this
autoimmune pathology also in some FasLgld/gld mice, albeit at decidedly lower incidence
(∼10%) and later in life compared to FasLΔm/Δm mice. In Faslpr/lpr mice lymphadenopathy
and accumulation of TCRα/β+CD4-CD8-B220+ T cells are accompanied by abnormally
increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6, Ifnγ and FasL
itself22. FasL was shown to activate NF-κB transcription factors and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Supplementary Fig. 1 5,18,19). We therefore
hypothesised that FasLΔm/Δm mice may develop autoimmune disease more rapidly and at
higher incidence than FasLgld/gld animals because only the former produce excess sFasL that
can bind to its receptor Fas, which may then activate NF-κB and thereby drive production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Consistent with this idea, at 3-5
months FasLΔm/Δm mice contained substantial numbers of cells with high levels of nuclear
(i.e. active) p65/NF-kB in the spleen, liver (Supplementary Fig. 10) and kidneys (not shown)
and high serum levels of TNFα (Supplementary Fig. 8; p<0.0001 for TNFα). These
abnormalities were significantly less prevalent in FasLgld/gld mice and were not detected in
FasLΔs/Δs or wt animals (Supplementary Figs. 8, 9 and 10).

Fas is expressed on hepatocytes and its activation causes apoptosis23,24. FasL can also be
found in the liver, produced by infiltrating T lymphocytes or resident myeloid cells, and it
has therefore been hypothesised that FasL-Fas induced apoptosis prevents tumorigenesis in
this organ25. Interestingly, a significant fraction (27% by 18 months) of both strains of
FasLΔm/Δm mice developed hepatic tumours with deposits in the spleen and lungs (Fig.
4d,e). Microscopically and by immuno-phenotype (Mac-1+Mac-2+F4/80+B220-Thy-1-CD3-)
these tumours were characteristic of histiocytic sarcoma (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig.
11), being composed of oval cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated or folded
nuclei26. These tumours were transplantable in C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. 11),
confirming their malignant status. Histiocytic sarcoma was rarely seen in FasLΔs/Δs or
FasLgld/gld animals and in C57BL/6 (wt) mice such tumours are observed only at very low
frequency late in life (∼5% >18 months26,27; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Our findings that mFasL but not sFasL is critical for AICD of T cells in vitro and for
prevention of lymphadenopathy, hyper-gammaglobulinemia and accumulation of autoantibodies within the whole animal are consistent with the notion that repeated TCR
stimulation kills chronically activated T cells that are specific for auto-antigens or persistent
pathogens through FasL-Fas signalling, thereby preventing lymphadenopathy1-4. The

observation that FasLΔm/Δm mice develop SLE-like glomerulonephritis and histiocytic
sarcoma considerably earlier and with higher incidence than FasLgld/gld mice indicates that
the high levels of sFasL produced in the FasLΔm/Δm mice, which in contrast to FasLgld can
engage its receptor Fas12,13, may promote autoimmunity and tumorigenesis. sFasL may
achieve this by triggering non-apoptotic signalling pathways, such as NF-κB-dependent
inflammatory processes. Alternatively, differences between FasLgld/gld and FasLΔm/Δm mice
may be due to the fact that retrograde signalling through FasL28,29 can only occur in the
former but not the latter, although upon challenge with influenza virus in vivo or stimulation
with suboptimal doses of anti-CD3 antibodies in vitro, CD8+ T cell responses were
indistinguishable between wt, FasLgld/gld and FasLΔm/Δm mice (Supplementary Figures 12
and 13). It is theoretically also possible that FasLΔm/Δm mice die earlier than FasLgld/gld
mice because the FasLΔm mutation causes complete loss of function whereas FasLgld
represents a partial loss of function mutation. For two reasons this appears unlikely: (1)
lymphadenopathy and hyper-gammaglobulinemia occur in the two mutant strains
(FasLΔm/Δm and FasLgld/gld) with comparable kinetics and magnitude (Fig. 3), indicating
that the two mutations do not differ markedly in their potency, and (2) histiocytic sarcoma
has not been reported in FasL knock-out mice30. We therefore hypothesise that
tumorigenesis may be driven by a combination of loss of mFasL-mediated apoptosis of cells
undergoing transformation and sFasL-Fas induced non-apoptotic signals, perhaps NF-κBmediated stimulation of cell proliferation, survival and/or inflammation within an elevated
cytokine milieu.

Methods Summary
Generation of FasL mutant mice

Author Manuscript

The mouse fasl locus and known restriction sites were used to construct the targeting vector
and diagnose homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells and gene-targeted
(FasLΔm/Δm, FasLΔs/Δs) mice. Targeting knock-in vectors were made with the loxP/
pGKNeo/loxP cassette cloned into the Pac1 site. Targeting constructs for the mutant FasL
mice (Supplementary Fig. 2) were linearised and electroporated into C57BL/6-derived
Bruce-4 ES cells.
Analysis of FasL mutant mice

Author Manuscript

All experiments with mice were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics
committees of our institutions. Mice were killed at 6, 12 or 20 weeks for analysis and further
cohorts were monitored daily for morbidity and killed when showing signs of illness.
Tissues were fixed for microscopic analysis in 80% Histochoice (Amresco)/20% ethanol or
10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin and conventional histopathology was
performed on hematoxylin plus eosin stained sections. For detailed methods for

Solid lines show staining with an anti-FasL antibody and dotted lines show staining with an
isotype-matched control antibody. Values represent mean +/- SD of mFasL+ T cells from 3
independent experiments (p<0.05 wt vs FasLΔm/Δm mice at 6 and 24 h; p<0.05 wt vs
FasLΔs/Δs mice at 6 h). For all experiments (b,c,d,e) T cells were stimulated with ConA for
3 days, rested for 2 days in IL-2 (0 h) and then restimulated with PMA plus ionomycin for 6
or 24 h.

squares), FasLΔs/Δs (black stars) or FasLgld/gld (purple triangles) mice (a) or from wt (blue
squares), FasLΔm/Δm (red circles) or FasLgld/gld (purple triangles) mice (b) at the indicated
effector:target ratio. The percentage of CH1 target cell killing was measured by FACS
analysis after 24 h. c,d, Activated T cells from wt (blue squares), FasLΔs/Δs (black stars) or
FasLgld/gld (purple triangles) mice (c) or from wt (blue squares) FasLΔm/Δm (red circles) or
FasLgld/gld (purple triangles) mice (d) were either cultured in medium plus IL-2 (broken
lines) or restimulated for 6, 24 or 48 h with antibodies to CD3 (solid lines). Cell survival
was measured by staining with PI plus FITC-coupled annexin V and FACS analysis. Values
in graphs in a,b,c,d represent mean +/- SEM from 3 independent experiments. * p<0.05 a,c

FasLgld/gld (purple), FasLΔm/wt (green) or FasLΔm/Δm (red) mice of the ages indicated were
weighed. c,d, The percentages of the ‘unusual’ CD3+B220+ T cells in the lymph nodes of
these mice were determined by FACS analysis (numbers indicate % of cells in each
quadrant). e, The levels of the indicated immunoglobulin isotypes in the sera of these mice
(age 5 months) were determined by ELISA, mean +/- SD. f, The levels of anti-nuclear
autoantibodies (ANA) in the sera of these mice, aged 3 (left panel) or 5 months (right panel)
were quantified by indirect immunofluorescence staining (1/100 serum dilution) of slides
covered with human HEp-2 epithelial cells and scoring of brightness of fluorescence
intensity on a scale of 0: no fluorescence to 3+: maximal fluorescence. g, Examples of ANA
quantification in sera of mice of the indicated genotypes. Immunofluorescence intensity
score is indicated in brackets. Values in graphs in a,b represent mean +/-SEM and in c,e,f
they represent mean +/-SD from a minimum of 10 to 52 FasLΔm/Δm mice. h, The levels of
