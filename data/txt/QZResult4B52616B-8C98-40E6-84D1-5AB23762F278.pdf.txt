ABSTRACT
Endostatin is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that exhibits potential antitumor efficacy in various preclinical animal models. However, its relatively short
in vivo half-life and the long-term, frequent administration of high doses limit its
widespread clinical use. In this study, we evaluated whether a fusion protein of
murine endostatin (mEndo) to a humanized antibody against tumor-associated
glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72), which is highly expressed in several human tumor tissues
including colon cancer, can extend the serum half-life and improve the anti-tumor
efficacy of endostatin by targeted delivery to the tumor mass. The fusion protein
(3E8-mEndo) and mEndo showed improved anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and
in vivo, predominantly by interfering with pro-angiogenic signaling triggered by
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, in mice treated with 3E8-mEndo,
we observed a markedly prolonged serum half-life and significantly inhibited tumor
growth. The improved anti-tumor activity of 3E8-mEndo can be partially explained
by increased local concentration in the tumor mass due to targeted delivery of 3E8mEndo to implanted colon tumors. Collectively, our data clearly indicate that tumortargeting antibody fusions to endostatin are a powerful strategy that improves the
poor pharmacokinetic profile and anti-tumor efficacy of endostatin.

INTRODUCTION

Tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG)-72 is
overexpressed in many carcinoma tissues, including
colorectal, ovarian, breast, gastric, and pancreatic,
compared with corresponding normal tissues [10, 11].
Previously, we reported that a mutant version of the
humanized antibody against TAG-72, designated a
3E8, has a higher binding affinity, but negligible
immunogenicity, compared with the original murine
monoclonal antibody (CC49) or humanized antibody
(huCC49). Moreover, 3E8 was efficiently delivered to the
tumor and persistently localized in the tumor mass. The
plasma stability of 3E8 was highly increased compared
to the huCC49 antibody [12]. These properties suggest
that 3E8 may be a potential carrier to deliver therapeutic
proteins to tumors expressing TAG-72, such as colorectal
carcinoma, thereby increasing the local concentration of
therapeutic proteins.
This study was conducted to evaluate whether
fusion of endostatin to the C-terminus of the 3E8 antibody
can improve the in vivo half-life and anti-tumor efficacy
of endostatin, thus improving its clinical applicability.
Because this fusion protein significantly improved the
pharmacokinetic behavior and anti-tumor efficacy of
endostatin via selective delivery and enhanced retention
in tumor masses expressing TAG-72 protein without
adversely affecting its anti-angiogenic activities, fusion of
3E8 to endostatin could be a useful therapeutic strategy

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood capillaries
from preexisting vessels, plays a key role in tumor growth
and metastasis. Therefore, angiogenesis is considered an
attractive target for anticancer therapies. Currently, several
angiogenesis inhibitors are approved for the treatment of
cancer [1]. Because these inhibitors target only rapidly
proliferating tumor-associated endothelial cells and not
relatively dormant endothelial cells in normal tissue,
anti-angiogenic therapies are expected to be less toxic
than conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, targeting
relatively homogenous and genetically stable cells, such
as endothelial cells, may avoid acquired drug resistance.
Endostatin, a 20 kDa internal fragment of the
C-terminus of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous inhibitor
of angiogenesis. It has strong in vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic activities, and exhibits potential anti-tumor
efficacy in a variety of preclinical animal models of human
carcinomas, including metastatic colorectal cancer [2].
Although the mechanism of endostatin action is not fully
understood, endostatin appears to exert its anti-angiogenic
properties via interaction with several cell-surface
receptors on endothelial cells. For instance, endostatin
directly binds to VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor-2; KDR/Flk-1), which subsequently
inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)induced ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) activation [3]. Endostatin suppresses endothelial
cell migration by binding integrin α5β1 and thus inhibiting
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation [4]. In addition,
endostatin has been reported to inhibit Wnt-signaling
[5], and to induce cell cycle arrest in endothelial cells by
inhibiting cyclin D1 [6]. Despite these promising antiangiogenic and anti-tumor activities in preclinical settings,
endostatin clinical trials did not demonstrate significant
therapeutic benefits for patients with cancer.
Because anti-angiogenic therapy is cytostatic rather
than cytocidal, chronic administration of relatively high
doses of the therapeutic proteins is required to maintain
consistent and effective protein concentrations, thus
ensuring tumor growth suppression. Moreover, many
recombinant therapeutics, including endostatin, have a
relatively short in vivo half-life. Therefore, novel strategies
that enhance the in vivo half-life and improve patient
compliance are urgently required to enable the widespread
clinical use of these proteins.
Several strategies have been reported to increase
the in vivo half-life of therapeutic proteins. Among them,
the most widely used and successfully adopted strategy
is fusion of the Fc-region of immunoglobulin G or the
whole antibody to the therapeutic protein [7]. Moreover,
targeted delivery strategies have also been developed to
increase the local, rather than systemic, concentration of
therapeutic proteins in the tumor by fusing the proteins to
antibodies against tumor-specific antigens [8, 9].

RESULTS
Expression and purification of anti-3E8-mEndo
fusion proteins
We constructed and stably transfected an expression
vector for the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein, comprising
mouse endostatin (mEndo) fused to the C-terminal end of
3E8 antibody with a 17 amino acid-linker (Figure 1A),
into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO-DG44 cells.
Due to the presence of an endogenous Igκ leader sequence,
the expressed 3E8-mEndo fusion protein was secreted.
Secreted 3E8 and 3E8-mEndo fusion proteins were
purified from culture supernatants using protein
A-sepharose affinity column chromatography. Purified
3E8 and 3E8-mEndo proteins were analyzed by SDSPAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions. Purified
3E8-mEndo migrated as a 190 kDa band under nonreducing conditions, indicating that it is composed of 3E8
(150 kDa) and two endostatin molecules (40 kDa) (Figure
1B). Western blot analyses using polyclonal anti-human
IgG showed an approximately 25 kDa immunoreactive
band corresponding to light chains of both 3E8 and 3E8mEndo, as well as two bands with molecular masses of
~50 kDa and ~70 kDa, corresponding to heavy chain
and heavy chain plus endostatin of 3E8 and 3E8-mEndo,
respectively (Figure 1B). In contrast, immunoblotting with
the anti-mEndostatin antibody only detects the 70 kDa

polypeptide comprising heavy chain plus endostatin of the
3E8-mEndo fusion protein (Figure 1B).
Next, to determine whether the fusion of 3E8 and
endostatin affects the binding ability to cells expressing
TAG-72 antigen or endothelial cells, we analyzed the
binding of 3E8, 3E8-mEndo, or mEndo to LS174T human
colon carcinoma cells or HUVECs using flow cytometry.
As shown in Figure 1C, 3E8 bound only to LS174T cells
but did not bind to HUVECs, reflecting expression of
TAG-72 in human colon carcinoma cells [12]. On the
other hand, it has been reported that endostatin can bind
to cell surface receptors including VEGFR-2 or basic
fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR-2) [13]. We
determined the expression of those receptors in LS174T
cells or HUVECs and observed that HUVECs express both
VEGFR-2 and FGFR-2 but LS174T cells express only
FGFR-2 (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B). Consistent
with the findings that mEndo binding was observed in
LS174T cells and HUVECs, binding of the 3E8-mEndo
fusion protein was significantly increased compared to
3E8 or mEndo in LS174T cells and HUVECs (Figure 1C).
Because 3E8-mEndo fusion proteins are comprised of 3E8
and two molecules of endostatin, the increased binding of
3E8-mEndo can be explained by the sum of binding by
each binding moiety of the fusion protein. Collectively,
these results suggest that the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can bind to carcinoma cells expressing TAG-72 antigen or
endothelial cells at higher levels than 3E8 or endostatin.

Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation,
migration, and tube formation by the 3E8mEndo fusion protein
To determine whether the fusion of endostatin to
3E8 affects the anti-angiogenic activities of endostatin, we
examined the effects of 3E8-mEndo on endothelial cell
proliferation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation
in response to VEGF. VEGF stimulation significantly
induced HUVEC proliferation and migration (Figure 2A
and 2B). However, pre-treating cells with mEndo or 3E8mEndo significantly inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation
and migration in HUVECs. The anti-angiogenic activity of
the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein appears to be higher than
mEndo because cells treated with 10 μg/ml of 3E8-mEndo
more potently inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation
and migration compared to cells treated with an equal
concentration of mEndo. Additionally, the 3E8 antibody
did not affect cell proliferation and migration in HUVECs
in the presence or absence of VEGF. Moreover, cells
treated with 3E8 or 3E8-mEndo without VEGF stimulation
did not exhibit any toxicity. Next, we examined the effects
of the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein on capillary-like tube

and 3E8-mEndo in the presence or absence of VEGF
(10 ng/ml). Tube formation was determined by the
presence of cells organized as closed polygons. mEndo
treatment significantly reduced VEGF-induced tube
formation, whereas the 3E8 antibody showed no signi­
ficant effects. Interestingly, cells treated with 3E8mEndo showed substantially inhibited VEGF-induced
tube formation in a dose-dependent manner, which was
dramatically higher than cells treated with mEndo.

fusion protein significantly inhibited VEGF-induced
vessel sprouting, whereas the 3E8 antibody did not show
any inhibitory effects in the presence or absence of VEGF.
In consistent with the finding that endostatin can bind to
FGFR-2 as well as VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells, 3E8mEndo also suppressed bFGF-induced arotic sprouting
(Supplementary Figure 2). To further determine the
inhibitory effects of 3E8-mEndo in vivo, we performed
mouse Matrigel plug assays. Matrigel plugs in mice were
excised and photographed. Matrigel plugs containing
VEGF alone or in combination with the 3E8 antibody
were red in color, indicating neovascularization (Figure
3C). In contrast, blood vessel formation was significantly
decreased in Matrigel plugs containing mEndo or 3E8mEndo in the presence of VEGF. Moreover, Matrigel
plugs stained with the anti-CD31 antibody revealed more
significant inhibition of neovascularization in plugs treated
with 3E8-mEndo compared to mEndo (Figure 3D and 3E).
Collectively, these results suggest that the anti-angiogenic
activities of the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein were well
preserved and perhaps more potent than mEndo both
in vitro and in vivo.

Ex vivo and in vivo anti-angiogenic activities of
the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein
We further evaluated the anti-angiogenic activity
of 3E8-mEndo using ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis
models. Mouse aortic rings were placed on growth factorreduced Matrigel for vessel sprouting ex vivo assays. As
shown in Figure 3A and 3B, vessel sprouting at the aortic
rings was significantly increased by VEGF stimulation.

The 3E8-mEndo fusion protein inhibited VEGF
signaling through the binding of VEGFR-2

significantly blocked VEGF-induced ERK1/2 and
p38 MAPK phosphorylation in HUVECs (Figure 4B).
Moreover, treatment of HUVECs with 3E8-mEndo
significantly inhibited VEGF-induced FAK, Src, and
paxillin phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Immunofluorescent
staining with F-actin and paxillin showed that actin stress
fiber formation and the number and size of focal adhesion
in VEGF-stimulated HUVECs were markedly increased.
However, cells treated with 3E8-mEndo or mEndo prior
to VEGF stimulation showed highly impaired actin stress
fiber and focal adhesion formation (Figure 4D). Similarly,
LS174T cells treated with 3E8-mEndo or mEndo
showed significant inhibition of bFGF-induced FGFR-2
activation and the downstream signaling pathways
including Akt and Src phosphorylation (Supplementary
Figure 3). Collectively, these results indicate that 3E8mEndo can suppress VEGFR-2 and FGFR-2 signaling
pathways in HUVECs and LS174T cells.

Based on the findings demonstrating that endostatin
suppresses VEGF-induced downstream signaling that is
involved in endothelial cell proliferation and migration
[14, 15] by directly binding to VEGFR-2 [3], we
determined the effects of 3E8-mEndo on VEGF-induced
VEGFR-2 signaling pathways. Stimulation of cells with
VEGF (10 ng/ml) significantly increased VEGFR-2
phosphorylation at Tyr1175. However, pretreatment of
cells with 3E8-mEndo or mEndo significantly reduced
VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 at Tyr1175
(Figure 4A). However, cells treated with the 3E8
antibody alone were unaffected. Activation of ERK1/2
and p38 MAPK, as well as the Src-FAK signaling
cascade, induced by VEGFR-2 phosphorylation plays
an important role in endothelial cells proliferation
and migration [3, 16]. The 3E8-mEndo fusion protein

The 3E8-mEndo fusion protein is stable, and has
improved tumor targeting and anti-tumor effects
compared to commercial endostatin

endostatin. To evaluate the tumor-targeting capability of
3E8-mEndo independent from the effects of its prolonged
in vivo half-life, we first measured the localization of 3E8mEndo, Fc-mEndo, and mEndo to the antigenic tumor
mass site. Athymic mice were injected subcutaneously
with LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma cells. When
the implanted tumors became palpable, 125I-3E8-mEndo,
125
I-Fc-mEndo, or 125I-mEndo was injected into the tumorbearing mice. Tumors were collected 2, 24, 48, and 72 h
post-injection. The localization of each protein in the
tumor was calculated as the percentage of the injected
dose/g of tumor tissue (Figure 5B). 125I-mEndo levels in
tumors rapidly decreased 24 h after the dosing, whereas
125
I-Fc-mEndo levels were maintained at steady-state
levels over the experimental period. However, significantly

To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the 3E8mEndo fusion protein and mEndo, mice were injected
intravenously with equimolar amounts of 3E8-mEndo
and mEndo. Whole blood was collected at the indicated
time intervals. Serum concentrations of endostatin were
measured using ELISA for mouse endostatin. mEndo
was rapidly eliminated from the serum in mice, 12 h after
injection. In contrast, similar serum levels of 3E8-mEndo
were maintained 72 h post-injection (Figure 5A).

intravenously into mice. At each time point, three mice were sacrificed. The percentages of the injected dose per gram (% ID/g) were
determined in the tumor. (C and D) Human LS174T cells (5 × 106) were implanted in the flank of athymic mice (n = 11), followed on day 6
by equimolar injections every other day (for a total of 8 times) of 3E8-mEndo (47.5 μg), 3E8 antibody (37.5 μg), Fc-mEndo (22.5 μg), and
mEndo (10 μg). Tumor volumes were measured as described. *p < 0.05; #p < 0.05. Error bars indicate ± SEM. (E) Immunohistochemical
staining of CD31-positive blood vessels in intra- and peritumoral regions of tumors from control or mice treated with 3E8, mEndo, or

higher localization was observed in the tumor tissues of
mice given 125I-3E8-mEndo proteins compared to those
treated with 125I-Fc-mEndo or 125I-mEndo. 125I-3E8-mEndo
levels peaked at 24 h and were maintained until 72 h
post-dosing. These data indicate that 3E8-mEndo fusion
proteins are localized to tumor tissues by their ability to
bind TAG-72 antigens in the tumor cells, rather than by
their prolonged in vivo half-life.
To determine whether the prolonged serum halflife of 3E8-mEndo and its localization into tumor tissues
translates to improved anti-tumor efficacy, we examined
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the anti-tumor activity of the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein
against human colon cancer LS174T xenografts in
athymic mice. Equimolar doses of each protein were
injected every other day for 2.5 weeks. Compared to
IgG-treated control mice, 3E8-treated mice exhibited
no significant inhibition of tumor growth, whereas mice
treated with mEndo or Fc-mEndo showed significant
inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 5C) and more do so in
mice treated with 3E8-mEndo fusion protein. Moreover,
no significant general toxicities were observed in control
or treated mice, as determined by loss of body weight

(Figure 5D). To delineate whether the suppression of
tumor growth may be resulted from the decreased tumor
angiogenesis, we analyzed microvessel density (MVD) in
tumors from control and mice treated with 3E8, mEndo,
or 3E8-mEndo. A significant correlation between the
suppression of tumor growth and the decreased tumor
angiogenesis was observed. As shown in Figure 5E, MVD
in tumors from 3E8-mEndo- or mEndo-treated mice
was significantly reduced in both peri- and intratumoral
regions and the reduction in MVD was more significant in
tumors from mice treated with 3E8-mEndo than mEndo,
whereas treatment with 3E8 did not decrease the MVD.
Collectively, these results strongly suggest that fusion of
the 3E8 antibody to endostatin is a useful strategy for the
treatment of tumors expressing the TAG-72 antigen.

respect, we selected the anti-TAG-72 antibody as a
fusion partner due to its specific binding ability to the
TAG-72 antigen in tumors, including colon carcinoma.
The anti-TAG-72 antibody has long been used as a
radioimmunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of ovarian
cancer, indicating that TAG-72 is a type of tumor-specific
marker [24, 25]. Adenovirus carrying fused CC49, a
humanized anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody, can
transfer a target gene selectively to ovarian carcinoma cells
without Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor and significantly
decreased adenovirus-mediated toxicity was observed
[26]. Moreover, several nanoparticles conjugated with the
anti-TAG-72 antibody, as well as a fluorophore-labeled
anti-TAG-72 antibody have also been used as targeting
agents for radioimmunotherapy and tumor imaging [27–
30]. Because TAG-72 is specifically expressed in colon
carcinoma tissues, we attempted to target colon carcinoma
using 3E8-mEndo in an effort to improve the anti-tumor
efficacy of this fusion protein. Interestingly, 3E8-mEndo
proteins were highly localized to the implanted colon
carcinoma tissues. This improved retention in the tumor
mass appears not to result from an extended half-life in
the circulation because 3E8-mEndo was more markedly
retained than Fc-mEndo, which has a similar in vivo halflife. Moreover, tumor growth suppression in mice treated
with 3E8-mEndo was significantly higher compared to FcmEndo or mEndo, and 3E8 antibodies did not show any
significant activity.
Angiogenesis is considered as an independent
prognostic marker for metastatic colon carcinoma patients
[31, 32]. VEGF-induced signaling through VEGFR-2
is a main axis that controls tumor angiogenesis. Warren
et al. [33] demonstrated that VEGF and VEGFR-2 are
highly expressed in both primary colorectal carcinomas
and their liver metastases, and play a critical role in
tumor growth and metastasis. VEGFR-2 inhibition using
a VEGFR-2-specific inhibitor (SU5416) or multiple
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (SU6668) revealed significant
inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and metastasis
with significantly decreased microvessel density [34].
These data suggest that targeting VEGF signaling is a
powerful approach to inhibit the growth and metastasis
of human colon carcinoma. Therefore, the finding that
endostatin suppresses VEGF signaling in endothelial cells
by directly interfering with VEGFR-2 activation, thus
inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, may have
clinical implications.
Although we clearly demonstrate that the 3E8mEndo fusion protein has improved anti-angiogenic
activities, an extended half-life in circulation, higher
localization in the tumor mass, and significantly enhanced
anti-tumor activities compared endostatin, the following
issues must be considered before clinical application of
this fusion protein in anti-cancer therapeutics. Although
it was not shown in the present study, endostatin has
been reported to have a biphasic U-shaped curve of

DISCUSSION
Clinical trials using human endostatin has failed
because they did not show a significant anti-tumor efficacy
in cancer patients [18–21]. This failure can be explained,
in part, by its short in vivo half-life. Additionally,
peak kinetics resulting from bolus administration of
recombinant endostatin may be insufficient to maintain
prolonged therapeutic levels in the tumor mass. Many
recombinant protein therapeutics with molecular masses
≤ 50 kDa (including 20 kDa endostatin) are rapidly cleared
from circulation by glomerular filtration and degradation
in the renal tubules. Thus, these proteins have short in vivo
half-lives of a few minutes to a few hours. In the present
study, we generated a fusion protein of murine endostatin
to a humanized antibody against TAG-72 antigen. The
resultant fusion protein, designated 3E8-mEndo, is a
secreted protein of ~190 kDa. Importantly, the half-life
of 3E8-mEndo was significantly increased compared to
murine endostatin. Similarly, Fc- or anti-HER2 antibody
fusion to endostatin showed prolonged half-lives in
circulation. For example, the elimination half-life (t1/2) of
the anti-HER2-endostatin fusion protein (40.2 ± 2.7 h) is
~10 times longer than that of endostatin (3.75 ± 2.18 h)
in normal mice [22]. Antibody fusion did not adversely
affect the anti-angiogenic activities of endostatin. In fact,
the anti-angiogenic potency of 3E8-mEndo appears to be
enhanced, resulting in part from the two-fold increased
avidity of endostatin in the fusion protein. Consistently,
endothelial cells treated with dimeric or trimeric endostatin
significantly inhibited tube formation compared to cells
treated with endostatin monomers [23].
Due to the prolonged half-life in circulation, the
Fc-Endostatin fusion protein was reported to have ~100
times higher anti-tumor efficacy than endostatin in an
animal model [17]. However, the local concentration
of therapeutic proteins in the tumor appears to be more
important than the level in the systemic circulation
because the primary targets of endostatin are the highly
proliferating tumor-associated endothelial cells. In this

activities.
Therefore,
well-designed
translational experiments are required to optimize its antitumor efficacy and other clinical parameters, including
the optimal dose and dosing schedules. In addition, the
anti-tumor efficacy of anti-angiogenic agents, including
endostatin, could be significantly increased if used in
combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
Accordingly, various combinations of 3E8-mEndo
and other therapeutic modalities should also be tested.
Contrary to the initial expectations, prolonged anti-VEGF
therapy with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal
VEGF neutralizing antibody, is reported to be associated
several clinical toxicities [35]. Moreover, tumor cells can
escape anti-VEGF therapy by producing other angiogenic
factors. Therefore, because angiogenesis inhibitors would
be administered for long periods of time, possible longterm safety concerns should also be assessed.
In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that
fusing the 3E8 antibody to endostatin is a promising
approach to extend the in vivo half-life of endostatin and
to improve its anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor efficacy.
Due to the powerful tumor-targeting ability of the antiTAG-72 antibody, this strategy can be expanded to other
anti-angiogenic proteins for the treatment of various
carcinomas expressing TAG-72.

The cDNA encoding mouse endostatin,
corresponding to the carboxyl terminal 183 amino acids of
mouse collagen XVIII (Genbank Accession no. A1326391),
was synthesized by reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using the following primers:
the forward primer (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTC
TGGTGCTGGAGCTTCAGGCATGGTGCATCCGGTTC
GGGATCTGGAAGCCATACTCATCAGGACTTTCAGC
CAGTG-3′), which contained DNA sequences corr­
esponding to the NotI restriction enzyme sequence,
a linker with 17 amino acids, and nine N-terminal
amino acids of mouse endostatin; the reverse primer
(5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTATTTGGA GAAAGAGG
TCATGAAGCTATTCTC-3′), which contained DNA
sequences corresponding to the C-terminal 10 amino acids
of mouse endostatin, a stop codon, and the NotI restriction
enzyme sequence. After the digestion with NotI, the PCR
product was subcloned into the re-digested pdCMV-dhfr3E8 vector to construct the plasmid p3E8-mEndo, which
expresses a fusion protein of mouse endostatin fused to
the C-terminal end of the heavy chain constant domain
(CH3) of the 3E8 anti-TAG-72 humanized antibody
through a 17 amino acid-linker peptide. DNA sequences
for the fusion protein of mouse endostatin fused to the
C-terminus of the Fc domain (CH2–CH3) of 3E8 (FcmEndo) were PCR amplified using primers (primer 1,
5′-GACGAATTCACTCTAACCATGGAA-3′; primer 2,
5′-AGTTTTGTCGACCTGGGAGAGGACACCTG TA
GT-3′; primer 3, 5′-CTCTCCCAGGTCGACAAAACTC
ACACATGCCCACCGTGC-3′; primer 4, 5′-CCGCTC
GACCTACTTGGAGGCAGTCATGAAGCTG-3′). Primer 1
and 4 contained EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme
sequences. The final fragment was digested with
EcoRI/XhoI and subcloned into the pJK-dhfr vector to
construct expression plasmid, Fc-mEndo.
For the stable expression of the 3E8-mEndo
fusion protein, the p3E8-mEndo expression vector was
transfected into CHO-DG44 cells using Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After selection in
MEM-α containing G418 in 96-well plates, resistant cell
clones were screened for the production of the assembled
fusion protein using an indirect ELISA and subjected to
step-wise methotrexate adaptation as described previously
[37]. Fc-mEndo was transiently expressed in HEK 293T
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and collected
from culture supernatants.
For production and purification of fusion proteins,
the CHO cell line that stably expressed the antibody was
grown in serum-free media (CHO-SFM II; Invitrogen).
Culture supernatants were subjected to affinity
chromatography on protein A-sepharose columns
(Amersham Biosciences) as described previously [38].

METERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
were isolated from human umbilical cord veins by
collagenase treatment as described previously [36]. Cells
from passages 2–7 were subsequently used in experiments.
HUVECs were grown in M199 media (Welgene, Daegu,
Korea) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 3 ng/ml
of basic fibroblast growth factor (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA), and 5 units/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) at 37°C under a humidified 95% and 5%
(v/v) mixture of air and CO2. LS174T human colorectal
carcinoma cells and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)deficient Chinese hamster ovary DG44 (CHO-DG44)
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle media
(DMEM) or minimum essential media (MEM)-α (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, USA), respectively, supplemented with
100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10%
FBS or 10% dialyzed FBS (for CHO-DG44 cell). VEGF165
and mouse endostatin (mEndo) were purchased from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Matrigel was
purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA).
Anti-human IgG and anti-mouse endostatin antibodies
were purchased from Sigma. Anti-CD31, phospho-VEGF
receptor 2 (Tyr1175), pSrcTyr416, pERK1/2, pFAKTyr397,
and anti-phospho-paxillin Tyr118 were purchased from Cell
Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA).

chamber were removed using a cotton swab. Cells that
migrated to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Chemotaxis was
quantified by counting cells that migrated to the lower
side of the membrane using light microscopy. Ten random
fields were counted for each assay.

Flow cytometry analyses

Matrigel tube formation assays

LS174T cells and HUVECs were detached with
cell dissociation buffer (Gibco), and treated with 3E8
(37.5 μg/ml, equimolar to 10 μg mEndo), 3E8-mEndo
(47.5 μg/ml, equimolar to 10 μg mEndo), and/or mEndo
(10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then blocked
with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30
min at room temperature. Cells treated with 3E8 or 3E8mEndo were incubated with the anti-3E8 antibody (10
μg/ml) or human IgG (isotype control; 10 μg/ml) at 4°C
for 1 h in PBS containing 1% BSA. Cells treated with
mEndo were incubated with the anti-mEndo antibody
for 1 h at 4°C. After incubation, cells were washed three
times with 1% BSA in PBS and stained with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human IgG for 30
min at 4°C. After washing twice with PBS, cells were
stained with propidium iodide (PI) to discriminate dead
cells and live cells. Cells that negatively stained with PI
were gated using a FACS caliber (BD Immunocytometry
System, San Jose, CA, USA) and used for subsequent
antibody binding experiments.

Tube formation was assayed as previously
described [40]. In brief, 250 μl growth factor-reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
was pipetted into 24-well tissue culture plates and
polymerized for 30 min at 37°C. HUVECs were
harvested, and 1.5 × 105 cells were resuspended in M199
media containing 1% FBS. Cells were pretreated with the
indicated concentrations of 3E8-mEndo, mEndo, or 3E8
for 30 min, plated onto the Matrigel layer, and 10 ng/
ml VEGF was added. After incubation for 20 h at 37°C,
vascular tube-like structures were quantified using an
inverted microscope.

Aortic ring assays
Aortas were harvested from C57BL/6 mice (aged
7 weeks) and sectioned into several pieces (aortic rings).
Each well of 48-well plates was coated with 120 μl
Matrigel. The aortic rings were placed on Matrigel-coated
wells, and covered with an additional 50 μl of Matrigel.
VEGF (50 ng/ml) with or without 3E8-mEndo, mEndo,
or 3E8, was added to the wells in a final volume of 200 μl
endothelial basal media (EBM; Lonza). Plates were
incubated at 37°C, and media were changed every 2 days
for 2 weeks. Angiogenic sprouting from aortic rings was
examined in five rings per group (n = 5). Each aortic
ring was photographed, and sprouting was quantified
by counting the number of vascular sprouts that directly
originated from the aorta. Photographed images were
divided into 5 regions, and sprouts in each region were
scored from 0 (least positive) to 5 (most positive) in a
double-blind manner. Each data point was assayed five
times.

Endothelial cell proliferation and migration
assays
Endothelial cell proliferation assays were performed
as previously described [39]. Briefly, HUVECs (2 × 105
cells/well) were seeded onto gelatin-coated 6-well plates
for 24 h, washed with M199, and the culture media were
replaced with M199 containing 1% FBS for 6 h. Cells
were then treated with 3E8 (10 μg/ml), mEndo (10 μg/
ml), or 3E8-mEndo (2, 5, or 10 μg/ml) proteins for 30 min,
and incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 10
ng/ml VEGF165, as indicated. Cell viability was analyzed
using Trypan blue dye exclusion tests. Only viable cells
were counted.
Transwell chemotaxis assays were performed as
described previously [39]. Briefly, transwell chamber
membranes (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μM pore size; Corning
Costar, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with 10 μg/
ml gelatin. For chemotaxis assays, 20 ng/ml VEGF in
M199 media (1% FBS) were added to the lower chamber.
HUVECs (1 × 106 cells/ml) were suspended in M199
containing 1% FBS. Various concentrations of the 3E8mEndo fusion protein, 10 μg/ml of 3E8 antibody, and/
or 10 μg/ml of mouse endostatin were added to the cells
for 30 min at room temperature before seeding. Cell
suspensions (100 μl) were added to the upper chamber.
After incubating for 4 h, cells remaining in the upper

In vivo matrigel plug assays
Matrigel plug assays were performed as
previously described [40]. Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were
subcutaneously injected with 0.6 ml of Matrigel containing
200 ng VEGF and 10 units heparin, with or without
the 3E8-mEndo fusion protein (47.5 μg, equimolar to
10 μg mouse endostatin), mEndo (10 μg), or 3E8 (37.5 μg,
equimolar to 10 μg mEndo). The injected Matrigel rapidly
formed a single, solid gel plug. After 7 days, the skin of
the mouse was pulled back to expose the Matrigel plug,
which remained intact. To identify infiltrating endothelial
cells, immunohistochemistry was performed using the
anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences).

Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays

In vivo tumor growth assays

Cell lysates from HUVECs were analyzed by SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Blocked
membranes were incubated with the indicated primary
and secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were
visualized using chemiluminescence, followed by
exposure to X-ray film. Bands were quantified using
ImageJ software.
For focal adhesion and F-actin formation, cells were
attached to glass coverslips coated with 20 μg/ml gelatin.
After starvation for 6 h in M199 media containing 1%
FBS, cells were pretreated with 3E8-mEndo or mEndo,
and stimulated with 10 ng VEGF. Cells were washed
once in PBS, fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde,
permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature with 0.2%
Triton X-100, washed in PBS, and blocked for 30 min at
room temperature in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS.
After incubation for 1 h with the paxillin antibody, cells
were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h with FITCconjugated anti-mouse antibodies and TRITC-labeled
phalloidin (Sigma) in PBS. Cells were washed with PBS,
stained with DAPI for nuclei staining, and coverslips
were mounted on the slide. Images were captured with
an Olympus DP30BW digital camera and processed using
the Metamorph 7.1 program (Universal Imaging, Media,
PA, USA).

To evaluate anti-tumor activity of 3E8-mEndo
fusion proteins in vivo, human LS174T colon cancer cells
(5 × 106) were subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted in the flank
of athymic mice (BABL/c-nu/nu; aged 5–6 weeks; n = 11
per group). Beginning on day 5, mice were injected i.v.
with equimolar amounts of purified 3E8-mEndo (47.5 μg),
3E8 antibody (37.5 μg), Fc-mEndo (22.5 μg), and mEndo
(10 μg) as indicated. This treatment was repeated every
other day for 8–9 doses as indicated. Mice were weighed
and tumors monitored three times per week in 2 diameters
using digital calipers. Tumor volumes were determined
using a2 × b × 0.5, where a is the shortest diameter and b
is the longest diameter.

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM). Differences between groups were
analyzed using Student’s t-tests. p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Data are representative of at least
three independent experiments.

Pharmacokinetics of 3E8-mEndo fusion
proteins
To monitor the levels of 3E8-mEndo fusion proteins
in serum, BALB/c mice (n = 5, aged 5–6 weeks) were
intravenously (i.v.) injected with either 3E8-mEndo
(47.5 μg, equimolar to 10 μg mouse endostatin) or mouse
endostatin (10 μg). Blood samples were serially collected
at indicated time intervals by retroorbital puncture
with non-heparinized capillary tubes. Samples were
placed at room temperature for 30 min, and serum was
collected after centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min.
Concentrations were determined using mouse endostatin
ELISA kits (Cusabio, Wuhan, Hubei, China) following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
