ABSTRACT:
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are the sixth most common
malignant neoplasm and more than 50% of patients succumb to this disease.
HNSCCs are characterized by therapy resistance, which relies on the overexpression
of anti-apoptotic proteins and on the aberrant regulation of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). As inherent and acquired resistance to therapy counteracts
improvement of long-term survival, novel multi-targeting strategies triggering cancer
cell death are urgently required. We investigated how induction of replicational stress
by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) combined with histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) exerts anti-tumor activity. We treated HNSCC cell
lines and freshly isolated tumor cells with HDACi, such as the clinically approved antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA), in combination with HU. Our data demonstrate that
at clinically achievable levels VPA/HU combinations efficiently block proliferation as
well as clonogenic survival, and trigger apoptosis of HNSCC cells. In the presence
of VPA/HU, such tumor cells increase expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family
protein BIM, independent of wild-type p53 signaling and in the absence of increased
expression of the p53 targets PUMA and BAX. The pro-apoptotic activity of BIM in
HNSCCs was found critical for tumor cell death; ectopic overexpression of BIM induced
HNSCC apoptosis and RNAi-mediated depletion of BIM protected HNSCC cells from
VPA/HU. Also, significantly elevated BIM levels (p<0.01) were detectable in the
apoptotic tumor centers versus proliferating tumor margins in HNSCC patients (n=31),
underlining BIM’s clinical relevance. Importantly, VPA/HU treatment additionally
reduces expression and cell surface localization of EGFR. Accordingly, in a xenograft
mouse model, VPA/HU efficiently blocked tumor growth (P<0.001) correlating
with BIM induction and EGFR downregulation. We provide a molecular rationale
for the potent anti-cancer activities of this drug combination. Our data suggest its
exploitation as a potential strategy for the treatment of HNSCC and other tumor
entities characterized by therapy resistance linked to dysregulated EGFR activation.

INTRODUCTION

combination of HDACi and HU may be applicable for
the treatment of HNSCC nor have molecular mechanisms
underlying its potential anti-tumoral activity been
resolved.
Our study demonstrates for the first time that this
drug combination efficiently eliminates HNSCC cancer
cells by evoking expression of the pro-apoptotic protein
BIM (B cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell
death) and by downregulation of EGFR. This potent dual
anti-tumoral activity suggests the clinical exploitation of
this novel drug combination as a strategy to counteract
therapy resistance in HNSCC.

With a worldwide annual incidence of more than
640,000 cases, head and neck cancer is the sixth most
common malignant neoplasm in humans [1, 2]. The
majority of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is induced by chronic exposure to a surplus of
carcinogens enclosed in all forms of tobacco, synergized
by heavy alcohol consumptions and/or is associated with
oncogenic human papillomaviruses [3, 4]. HNSCC is
characterized by local tumor aggressiveness, high rate
of early recurrences and development of second primary
carcinomas [3]. Loco-regional relapse after therapy
is the major cause of death despite modern disease
management strategies [5, 6]. Hence, long-term survival
rates, especially for advanced HNSCC (30-40%), have
not improved significantly over the last decades [3, 6].
Currently, EGFR-targeting agents, such as antibodies or
tyrosine kinase inhibitors gained major clinical attention
[3, 7]. Despite encouraging developments, EGFR-directed
therapies are effective only in a relatively small percentage
of cancer patients underlining the need for additional
combination treatment options [7-9].
Therapy resistance favoring recurring or advancedstage HNSCC mainly results from failure of the tumor
cells to undergo chemoradiation-induced apoptosis [1,
3]. Particularly, the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of
programmed cell death (PCD) plays an important role for
killing cancer cells in response to various therapies, and is
controlled by interactions among pro- and anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 protein family members [10, 11]. Pro-survival
proteins like BCL-XL and BCL-2 inhibit apoptosis by
binding and neutralizing the activities of the pro-apoptotic
multidomain proteins BAX and BAK as well as the BH3
domain-only proteins BIM, BIK, NOXA, and PUMA [1012].
Overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins
and apoptosis inhibitors like Survivin plays a critical role
for therapy resistance and overall survival in HNSCC [10,
11, 13]. Consequently, strategies for neutralizing these
cytoprotective factors involve shifting the cellular balance
of anti- versus pro-apoptotic proteins in favor of the latter
[10, 11, 13].
In this respect, histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi), such as VPA, have emerged as promising
chemotherapeutic agents by inducing a wide range of
anti-tumoral activities, including induction of cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis [14-20]. HDACi can correct aberrant
genomic and non-genomic signaling by chromatin
remodeling as well as histone/protein modifications
[21]. Likewise, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor
hydroxyurea (HU) sensitizes tumors to cancer therapyinduced apoptosis and has been used to treat HNSCC,
particularly as part of chemoradiation platforms [22,
23]. However, it has not been investigated whether the

RESULTS
Combining VPA with HU cooperate in the killing
of HNSCC tumor cells and loss of clonogenicity
Cell lines representing HNSCC from different
anatomical sites (Supplementary Table SI) were treated
with VPA and HU alone and in combination. MTT
assays revealed that although VPA and HU individually
inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, coadministration of VPA/HU was most effective (Figure
1A and B; Supplementary Table SI). Similar results were
obtained using a clonogenic cell survival assay (Figure
1C). FACS analysis showed that the VPA/HU combination
potently induced apoptosis and confirmed that HU
induced S-phase arrest (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure
S1A). Induction of cell death was already evident using
a single dosage of VPA/HU (0.5 mM/0.3 mM) and was
not dependent on repetitive drug administration (Figure
2A). VPA/HU-induced apoptosis was further confirmed
by independent experimental approaches. Immunoblot
analysis showed enhanced cleavage of Caspases-3, -8
and -9 (Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure S1B). Also,
increased Caspase-3 activity was detectable in lysates
from treated cells, which could be counteracted by the
pan-Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Figure 2B). The
observed cleavage of Caspase-9, the loss of mitochondrial
integrity, and DNA fragmentation upon treatment
strongly imply that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is
responsible for VPA/HU induced cell death (Figure 2C;
Supplementary Figure S1C). Similar results were obtained
for several HNSCC cell lines tested and this effect was
not restricted to VPA as treatment with other HU/HDACi
combinations, such as TSA or butyrate, also resulted in
cell death (Supplementary Table SI; Supplementary Figure
S1D; data not shown).

Induction of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM by
VPA/HU treatment correlates with cell death

both drugs slightly induced expression of BIM, the effect
was most prominent using the VPA/HU combination,
correlating with enhanced apoptosis. The doses required
to induce appreciable Caspase-3 activation and apoptosis
were comparable to those necessary to induce BIM
expression (Figure 2 and 3A). Notably, this effect was
not restricted to VPA as treatment with other HU/HDACi
combinations, such as with TSA or butyrate, also resulted
in BIM induction and cell death (Supplementary Figure
S1D; data not shown). Another BH-3-only protein, p53upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), was recently
reported to mediate apoptosis induced by EGFR inhibitors
in HNSCC cells [12]. In contrast to the strong induction
of BIM by VPA/HU, immunoblot analysis revealed no
enhanced expression of PUMA, BAX, and BCL-2/BCLxL (Figure 3G and data not shown). Moreover, VPA/HU
could induce BIM in p53-negative PC3 cells, and BIM
induction could be verified by independent methods in
p53-mutant FaDu cells (Supplementary Figure S1E, S2A).

When analyzing the effects of VPA/HU treatment
on the levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins,
we observed increased BIM levels (Figure 3A). Although

BIM is critical for VPA/HU-induced tumor cell
apoptosis
To demonstrate that enhancing BIM levels triggers
apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines, we first performed ectopic
overexpression studies. Transfection of plasmids encoding
a BIMEL-GFP fusion or untagged BIMEL, the longest BIM
isoform (196 amino acids), resulted in efficient cell death
(Figure 3B and not shown).
In order to further confirm the direct relevance of
BIM for HDACi/HU-induced apoptosis, we used RNAi
to deplete endogenous BIM. HNSCC cells with RNAimediated attenuated BIM expression displayed enhanced
proliferation linked to reduced basal apoptosis rates
(Figure 3C and data not shown). Furthermore, compared to
the scrambled control, these cell lines showed significantly
enhanced resistance to VPA/HU-induced cell death, as
verified by analyzing Caspase-3 activation, TUNELstaining and loss of mitochondrial integrity (Figure 3D;
Supplementary Figure S2B). Similar results were observed
for TSA or butyrate (data not shown). Collectively, these
results provide strong evidence that BIM is critical for the
HDACi/HU-induced killing of cancer cells.

BIM induction in tumor cells from head and neck
carcinoma patients

reporter constructs transfected into HNSCC cells suggest
a role of AP1 for the VPA/HU-mediated transcriptional
activation of BIM (Supplementary Figure S2D). A BIM
reporter containing an inactivated MYB-binding site was
still responsive to treatment (Supplementary Figure S2C).
Although the pharmacological inhibition of ERK signaling
was critical for BIM expression in B-RAF/K-RAS mutant
lung tumor cells [11], VPA/HU did not affect ERK levels
but still evoked enhanced BIM expression in our cell
models (Supplementary Figure S2E).

To underline the pathophysiological relevance of
BIM not only for tumor cell models but also for the clinics,
we first visualized BIM expression by IHC in tumor
biopsies (n=31). Using the immunoreactive score (IRS)
[25], significantly elevated BIM levels (p<0.001) were
observed in cancer cells in the apoptotic tumor centers
versus proliferating tumor margins (Figure 4A and 4B).
Second, to definitely demonstrate that BIM is induced by

measuring the sub-G1 population by flow cytometry (PI staining) 48 h post treatment. Induction of cell death was already evident using
a single dose of VPA/HU (1.5 mM/0.5 mM) and was not further enhanced by additional drug administration after 24 h (VPA/HU 2X). B)
VPA/HU treatment (1.5 mM each; 48 h) induced caspases activation sensitive to the pan-Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Immunoblot analysis
demonstrated cleavage of Caspase-3 and -9 (upper panel; tubulin, loading control. Apoptosis was quantified by measuring Caspase-3
activity in cell lysates (lower panel). C) VPA/HU-induced cell damage shown by analyzing mitochondrial integrity and by TUNELstaining. The VPA/HU combination (1.5 mM each) caused significant mitochondrial damage already 24 h post treatment, resulting in loss

(lower panel).

VPA/HU also in primary tumor cells, we used cancer cells
freshly isolated from HNSCC patients. Treatment of such
tumor cells with VPA/HU resulted in enhanced BIM levels
and cancer cell death (Figure 4C). Hence, regulated BIM
expression appears to be relevant for disease progression
and can be modulated by drug treatment.

26]. As EGFR-targeting strategies are intensively tested
in the clinics, we investigated the effects of VPA/HU
treatment on this receptor. Interestingly, immunoblot
analysis revealed that the combination of VPA/HU
efficiently reduced the levels of total and phosphorylated
EGFR (Figure 5A). To further examine the intracellular
localization of EGFR, cells were treated with VPA/HU
or PBS, and examined by IHC analysis. This analysis not
only confirmed the reduction of overall EGFR levels, but
also showed that such treatment affected the cell surface
localization of the receptor and additionally enhanced
BIM expression (Figure 5C). As a control, VPA/HU
treatment appears not to cause an unspecific degeneration

VPA/HU attenuates EGFR expression and

The EGFR is overexpressed in various epithelial
malignancies and also represses BIM expression [11,

manner. F) VPA/HU-mediated transcriptional activation was monitored by analyzing luciferase activity. FaDu cells transfected with a BIM

These in vitro-results encouraged us to examine
whether VPA/HU treatment also inhibits tumor growth in
vivo. Using a xenograft model, established FaDu tumors
were treated with VPA/HU (350 mg/kg, 750 mg/kg body
weight) or PBS control i.p. for 14 days. Administration
of VPA/HU to FaDu tumor-bearing mice significantly
inhibited tumor growth (p<0.001) (Figure 5D). To
visualize whether drug treatment also enhanced BIM
levels and caused EGFR attenuation in vivo, tumors
from treated and control animals were analyzed by IHC.
Enhanced BIM levels and reduced EGFR expression
were observed in tumors from VPA/HU treated animals
compared to those from control mice (Figure 5E). The
above data not only confirmed the potent anti-cancer
activity of the VPA/HU combination in vivo, but also
demonstrated the in vivo-relevance of the molecular
mechanisms identified in our cell culture models. Of
note, drug treatment of non-transplanted nude mice did
not result in loss of body weight, and no organ damage
was evident by histological inspection of treated C57BL/6
mice (data not shown). Hence, the anti-tumoral effect of
our drug combination was not mediated by unspecific
cytotoxicity.

of pro-survival proteins, as STAT3 levels, an important
factor for head and neck carcinogenesis [27] or the growth
factor receptor ERB-B2, were not significantly affected
(Figure 5B; Supplementary Figure S2E). Collectively,
these data provide evidence for a hitherto unknown
molecular mechanism contributing to the potent anticancer activity of the VPA/HU combination. However, we
cannot completely exclude the possibility that additional
effects of VPA/HU on other proteins may at least partially
contribute to the potent anti-tumoral activity of this drug
combination.

VPA/HU efficiently suppresses HNSCC tumor
growth in murine xenotransplantation models
Prior to testing the anti-tumoral activity of VPA/
HU in murine models, we first compared the cell
killing activity of VPA/HU and of chemotherapeutic
drugs currently used in the clinics. In our HNSCC cell
culture models and at the concentrations used, VPA/HU
treatment was more effective in triggering cell death, when
compared to the EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and gefitinib
or the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin (Supplementary
Figure S2F). Notably, interference with EGFR signaling
by gefitinib also induced BIM expression (Supplementary
Figure S2G).

DISCUSSION

apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and differentiation [15, 18,
20, 34, 35]. Numerous HDACi have been tested in the
clinics or are currently the subject of ongoing early-phase
clinical trials, including HNSCC [14, 19, 36-38]. Since
HDACi monotherapies seem not to be effective against
solid tumors, their full therapeutic potential will be best
realized through combination with other anticancer agents
[17, 19, 34]. However, most reports do not provide a welldefined molecular rationale for combining an HDACi with
a given agent. Moreover, the molecular events underlying
cooperative combination effects are often still to be
identified [17, 19, 34].
In contrast, we here provide convincing evidence
that activation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein
BIM together with EGFR attenuation are key regulators
for VPA/HU-induced tumor cell death. This conclusion
is based on several lines of evidence: First, HDACi/HU
induced BIM upregulation, induction of apoptosis and

Rational combination therapies are considered as the
most efficient strategy to combat cancer [9, 28]. As the
success of these treatments requires a profound molecular
knowledge of their underlying mechanisms [29-31], we
here studied the combination of two drugs, which have
been suggested to affect tumor cell death by different
mechanisms [23, 32, 33]. Employing comprehensive
cell culture and in vivo models we here demonstrate for
the first time that combining HDACi with HU potently
kills HNSCC by a dual mechanism. Although such agents
have been shown to individually affect tumor cells [22,
32], the (pre)clinical anti-tumor activities of the HDACi/
HU combinations as well as the underlying molecular
mechanisms have not been resolved so far for HNSCC.
Treatment of malignant cells with HDACi can
induce a wide range of anticancer effects including

growth in vivo. A/B) FaDu cells were treated with V, HU, VPA/HU (1.5 mM each) or PBS (C). Expression of the indicated proteins
was analyzed by immunoblotting. Actin served to control equal loading. VPA/HU treatment effectively reduced the levels of total and

as well as increased BIM levels. D) VPA/HU suppressed the growth of FaDu HNSCC xenograft tumors. Growth curve of tumors subjected

loss of the clonogenic potential of HNSCC cell lines
derived from different anatomical sites. This finding will
be clinically relevant as SCC from different anatomical
regions, like the hypopharynx or the oral cavity, differ
in their clinical prognosis and response [6], but do
express BIM as shown by the analysis of tumor biopsies.
Currently, the clinical relevance of results obtained
in permanent tumor cell lines are questioned, as such
cell lines may differ from primary tumor cells at their
molecular level [39]. However, also freshly isolated
tumor cells but not fibroblasts from HNSCC patients
responded to VPA/HU administered at therapeutically
achievable levels (0.5-1.5 mM) with BIM induction,
EGFR downregulation and apoptosis. Several clinical
studies have already demonstrated that VPA or HU plasma
levels in the 0.5-1.5 mM range can be achieved in cancer
patients without major toxicity [37, 40, 41], supporting an
expectable clinical efficacy of the VPA/HU combination.
Second, ectopic expression and RNAi experiments
convincingly demonstrate that BIM is the BCL-2 family
member essential for VPA/HU-induced cancer cell death.
Third, VPA/HU efficiently prevented progression of
HNSCC tumors in nude mice correlating with enhanced
BIM levels and attenuation of EGFR surface expression.
The tumor growth delay achieved with the combination
treatment was highly significant compared with the
untreated control, without major toxicity.
BIM-evoked apoptosis was found crucial for
epithelial tumor cell death triggered by anti-cancer
therapeutics [11, 42, 43]. We found that especially the
VPA/HU combination cooperatively activated BIM at
the transcriptional level. To date, several transcription
factors, including p53, E2F, c-JUN/FOS (AP1), MYB,
RUNX3, and FOXO3A have been reported to regulate
BIM transcription [11, 24, 44]. Our data suggest that
transcriptional activation of BIM in HNSCC by VPA/HU
is mediated via AP1, which is not subject to mutation in
oral cancer patients [45]. It is possible that HU-mediated
S-phase-dependent induction of c-JUN enhances BIM
expression [46]. Also, the activity of c-JUN is repressed
by the HDAC3-NCoR complex [47], which is particularly
sensitive to inhibition by VPA [15]. Phosphorylation
of c-JUN by JUN kinase (JNK) permits dissociation of
HDAC3 and c-JUN-dependent transcription [47]. HU
has been shown to activate JNK in vivo [48], which may
contribute to c-JUN-dependent BIM induction.
Although the BH-3-only protein PUMA was
recently reported to mediate apoptosis of HNSCC cell
lines induced by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors [12],
VPA/HU-mediated PCD did not require induction of the
p53 targets PUMA and BAX. This finding seems to be of
clinical relevance as VPA/HU-induced cell death does not
rely on p53, which is mutated in the majority of HNSCC
[49]. Moreover, HNSCC cells with attenuated BIM
expression displayed enhanced proliferation. Our finding
that lowering this endogenous pro-apoptotic factors not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

only increases tumor cell survival but also proliferation
might be involved in HNSCC therapy response and
disease progression. Although BIM plays a major role
in death signaling, this does not rule out the additional
participation of other BCL-2 family members and/or other
apoptosis inhibitor proteins [12, 50].
As we did not observe increased BCL-2/BCL-xL
levels upon VPA/HU treatment potentially neutralizing
increased BIM expression, it is conceivable to speculate
that the addition of BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-737,
may not further boost tumor cell death. Killing of B-RAF
mutant lung tumor cells with ABT-737 required BIM
induction by inhibition of ERK signaling. Furthermore,
B-RAF wild type cancer cells were even largely resistant
to this treatment [51]. As the frequency of RAF/RAS
mutations in HNSCC is rather low [52, 53], VPA/HU
is hence likely to be clinically more effective when
compared to certain other attempts to alter BCL-2 family
members [11]. It will furthermore be interesting to analyze
the putative impact of VPA/HU on other molecules
important for HNSCC survival. These are for example
Aurora kinase-A, which shares signaling pathways with
EGFR [54], and the structural protein NSP 5a3a promoting
HNSCC apoptosis via the p53-related factor p73 [29, 30].
HNSCC tumors are often characterized
by deregulated EGFR signaling due to receptor
overexpression, activating receptor mutations and
aberrant downstream signaling cascades [7]. Survival
is secured by the activation of MEK and ERK kinases,
leading to stabilization of MCL-1, activation of BCL-2,
and degradation of BIM [11]. (Pre)clinical approaches
interfering with EGFR signaling trigger apoptosis by also
enhancing BIM expression [7, 11; this study]. Importantly,
we show that VPA/HU treatment efficiently reduced not
only EGFR levels and signaling, but also attenuated
EGFR cell surface localization in cell and xenograft
models. Although recent antibody-based EGFR targeting
strategies have gained major attention, the clinical
response rates to such therapies are rather low. In addition,
the mechanism(s) conferring resistance of HNSCC against
agents targeting the EGFR are ill-defined [8, 9], and the
required agents are expensive and often show a suboptimal
pharmacodynamic profile. VPA and HU are stable lowercost drugs, which can be administered orally [14, 22,
33]. Moreover, the VPA/HU combination may represent
a contingency treatment option for patients acquiring
resistance to other EGFR-targeting approaches [8, 23, 54,
55]. Both, HU and VPA target major and general cellular
survival factors that are misregulated in a variety of human
cancers. E.g., cell cycle control is lost in the vast majority
of malignancies, and HDACs are frequently overexpressed
during tumorigenesis [17]. The molecular mechanisms
underlying EGFR attenuation upon exposure of malignant
cells to VPA/HU in vitro and in mice remain to be resolved
in detail. These may involve HU-induced replication
arrest, known to affect oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling
38

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 31 - 43

[56], and/or the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-CBL, which controls
EGFR ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation [57].
A major advantage allowing to expedite potential
clinical studies employing VPA/HU for the treatment of
HNSCC is the fact that both agents are FDA approved
drugs. Albeit hardly in combination, both are used
frequently in the clinic [17, 22, 37]. Thus, one can rely
on an extensive knowledge on the therapeutically most
effective dose and pharmacodynamics of these agents [32,
38]. Also, dose-limiting but clinically manageable side
effects are known, including myelosuppression, fatigue,
nausea, and diarrhea [22, 32, 33, 37, 38]. In contrast,
neither toxicity profiles nor clinical efficacy are known
for other anti-tumor strategies targeting BCL-2 family
members [51].
Our study has several potential limitations. One is the
use of immunocompromised mice as preclinical models
of human malignancies, which do not always reflect the
heterogeneity and complexity seen in patients. Second,
although significantly higher concentrations of VPA or HU
were previously used in tumor models without major signs
of toxicity [58-60], the VPA/HU doses employed in the
xenograft model exceed VPA/HU concentrations currently
used in patients [22, 40]. However, cell culture results
suggest that even low VPA/HU concentrations will show
anti-tumoral efficacy in vivo. The minimal effective dose,
the optimal application route (oral, i.p., i.v.), as well as
the effects of long-term treatment needs to be determined
in comprehensive preclinical studies prior to prospective
clinical trials.
In conclusion, in addition to current chemoradiotherapy platforms combining HU with HDACi might
prove as an extra treatment option for HNSCC. Although
not examined in this study, such drug combinations
may be of therapeutic interest also for other tumor
entities characterized by therapy resistance and EGFR
overexpression, such as colon cancer.

control were generated by transfection of pHR-THTBIMshRNA-SFFV-eGFP or pHR-THT-scr_shRNA-SFFVeGFP [65], respectively. Cells were transfected using PEI
(Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and selected by
addition of puromycin (1 µg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, Munich,
Germany). Luciferase reporter assays were carried out in
triplicate and repeated thrice as stated [62].

Microscopy and image analysis
Observation, image analysis and quantification of
protein localization were performed as described [66].
DNA/cell nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33258
staining (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) as described
before [66]. At least 100 fluorescent cells were analyzed
in three independent experiments.

Patients, tissue sampling and primary cell
isolation
Biopsies of patients diagnosed with HNSCC and
treated at the Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgery and ENT of the University Hospitals in Frankfurt
and Mainz were analyzed. Tumor specimens were
collected from primary tumors of patients who underwent
surgery. All cases were clinically and histologically
diagnosed according to established criteria including
grading and TNM-classification (Supplementary Table
SII). Studies of human tissue biopsies were performed
according to the requirements of the local ethics
committee (#83756604), and informed consent has
been obtained in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. For the isolation of primary cancer cells, tumor
specimens were cut into small pieces and enzymatically
digested with collagenase typeI/hyaluronidase (Sigma
Aldrich, Munich, Germany) in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37°C overnight. Following
digestion, dissociated cells were passed through a cell
strainer, and epithelial cancer cells and fibroblast were
isolated by MACS® separation using CD326 (EpCAM)
or α-fibroblast MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Cells were propagated for one week as
described [67] and subjected to analysis.

METHODS
Ethics Statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Drug treatment and clonogenic survival assay

Cells, transfections and luciferase assay

Cells were treated with VPA, trichostatin A (T),
sodium butyrate (B), HU, or cisplatin (Sigma Aldrich,
Munich, Germany) as described [16, 67]. The EGFR
antagonists gefitinib (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, USA)
and cetuximab (ImClone, New York, NY, USA) were
applied for 48 h. For colony formation assays, 1x103 cells/

Cultivation of the indicated head and neck cancer
and other tumor cell lines has been described in detail [25,

T25 flask were seeded in triplicate. 24 h later, cells were
treated with the indicated compounds or PBS control and
further cultivated for 10 days. Drug-containing medium
was replaced every day. Cells were fixed and stained with
Giemsa. Colonies containing >50 cells were counted
automatically using a colony counter (Oxford Optronics,
Oxford, United Kingdom). Data shown are calculated
from the mean values of three independent experiments.

using the immunoreactive score (IRS) [25]. IRS=SI
(staining intensity) x PP (percentage of positive cells). SI
is assigned as 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong.
PP is defined as 0, negative; 1, <5%; 2, 6–30%; 3, 31–
60%; and 4, >60% positive cells.

Antibodies (Ab)

Assessment of apoptosis was performed by
quantifying Caspase-3-dependent hydrolysis of a
fluorogenic substrate and by immunoblot-based detection
of cleaved caspases [62]. Apoptotic cells were visualized
by analyzing mitochondrial integrity using the PromoKine
Mitochondrial Apoptosis Staining Kit (PromoCell;
Heidelberg, Germany), staining of fragmented nuclei with
Hoechst dye or TUNEL-staining as described [69]. Briefly,
200 cells from three separate images were inspected and
the percentage of apoptotic cells determined. Cell viability
was calculated employing MTT-assays and the electric
sensing zone method as described in detail [61, 62]. Cell
cycle profiles were obtained by FACS-mediated analysis
of prodidium iodide (PI) stained cells as outlined before
[16].

Measurement of apoptosis, cell cycle and viability

Ab were: α-PUMA (4976) (NEB Cell Signaling,
Frankfurt, Germany); α-Survivin (Novus NB  500-201;
Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO); anti-ß-Actin (A2066),
α-BIM (B7929), anti-alpha-Tubulin (T5168) (Sigma
Aldrich, Munich, Germany); α-BCL-XL (66461A),
α-Caspase-8 (9745), -9 (9501) (Pharmingen); cleaved
Caspase-3 (9664) (Cell Signaling); α-BAX (sc-20067),
α-Caspase-3 (sc-7272/-7148), α-ERB-B2 (sc-284),
α-EGFR (sc-81449), α-ERK1/2 (sc-135900), α-STAT3 (sc482) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany).
Appropriate HRP-, Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were used.

Animals and xenograft tumors

Protein extraction, immunoblot analysis and
immunofluorescence

All animal work has been conducted according to
relevant national and international guidelines. For animal
studies, FaDu cells (2x106) cells were implanted into both
flanks of four-week-old female NMRI nu/nu mice (Harlan
Winkelmann, Hamburg, Germany) [69], and were allowed
to establish for 7 days followed by treatment for 14 days.
VPA/HU (350 mg/kg, 750 mg/kg body weight) or PBS
control was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every
second day as described [58]. Mice were randomized
into groups (4 mice/group) such that the average tumor
volumes across the groups were equal. Tumor growth
was monitored using calipers to calculate tumor volumes
according to the formula: length  x  π  width2 x 0.52.
Animals were euthanized at the end of the study, and
the tumors processed for IHC analysis as described [69].
To assess drug-induced side effects, VPA/HU or PBS
treatment was also performed in non-transplanted NMRI
nu/nu or eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (2 mice/
group). All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of Mainz.

Preparation of whole lysates from cells or tissue, coimmunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried
out as described [61, 62]. Equal loading of lysates was
controlled by reprobing blots for Actin or Tubulin as
described [62]. Immunofluorescence was performed as
described in detail [62, 66, 68].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tissue samples or transfected cell pellets were
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) and processed
for IHC as described [25, 61]. For antigen retrieval,
sections were treated in a pressure cooker with Tris buffer
(10 mM, pH9.0) for BIM or were treated with proteinase
K (S3020, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark)
for 8 min at room temperature for EGFR detection.
Sections were incubated with primary Ab (α-BIM, 1:800;
α-EGFR 1:50) overnight at 4°C. For visualization, the
EnVision® detection system (Dako GmbH, Hamburg,
Germany) was applied as described [25]. Sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative control slides
without primary Ab were included for each staining. For
quantification, sections were scanned at low power to
identify areas of positivity and three random fields were
selected. Expression levels for BIM were scored semiquantitatively based on staining intensity and distribution

Statistical analysis
For all experiments stating p-values, a paired
Student’s t-test was performed. Unless stated otherwise,
p-values represent data obtained from three independent
experiments done in triplicate. p-values <0.05 were

Plasmids and RNAi
The expression construct for human BIMEL,
pCDNA4/TO-BIMEL, was described [70]. For expression
of a BIMEL-GFP fusion, BIMEL cDNA was PCR
amplified and cloned into pc3-GFP (pc3BIMEL-GFP) as
stated before [66]. pGL3-luciferase reporter constructs
containing the BIM promoter, MYB, E2F or AP1 binding
sites were introduced previously [24]. Lentiviral vectors
constitutively expressing shRNA directed against BIM or
a scrambled control, pHR-THT-BIMshRNA-SFFV-eGFP
or pHR-THT-scr_shRNA-SFFV-eGFP, respectively, were
reported [65].
