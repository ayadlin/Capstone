Abstract
Schwannomas, although benign, can be fatal or give rise to
significant morbidity due to an unpredictable growth rate.
They can reoccur after surgery or radiation, current treatments each with significant inherent risks. These risks are further amplified in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a germ line
predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple schwannomas, underlying the need for biological targeted therapies.
Gleevec (STI571, imatinib mesylate), in addition to the bcrabl oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia, inhibits
c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling, thereby expanding its use to several malignant and benign human diseases. In the present study, we show that
human sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas have increased expression along with activation of PDGFR-α,
PDGFR-β, and c-kit receptors, compared with normal or traumatic nerve. Using the human NF2-null HEI-193 schwannoma
cell line, Gleevec inhibited schwannoma viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth, as well as induced
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 5–10 μmol/L).
These antitumorigenic effects were correlated to inhibition
of PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and c-kit activation/phosphorylation
and major downstream signaling pathways. Lack of robust xenograft or transgenic models of schwannomas prevents extension of these studies in vivo. However, the established long
track record and tolerable toxicity of Gleevec already in clinical use and our preclinical data lead us to propose that Gleevec should be evaluated in human schwannomas with shown
progressive growth. [Cancer Res 2009;69(12):5099–107]

Introduction
Schwannomas are benign tumors originating from Schwann
cells of peripheral or cranial nerves (1). Vestibular schwannomas
(VS) or acoustic neuromas have an estimated incidence of 0.7 to
1 per 100,000 population, but in 5% of cases they occur early in life
and are often bilateral in the germ line cancer predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), with an incidence of ∼1/

40,000 live births (2) Although the growth of majority of sporadic
and NF2-associated VS is insidious and slow (1–2 mm/y), in a subset growth can be in unpredictable spurts (>1 cm/y; ref. 3). These
growth spurts can be associated with clinical symptoms due to
brain stem compression, compromise of adjacent cranial nerve
function (Fig. 1), and often precipitate active intervention in the
form of surgery or radiosurgery, each with their short- and longterm risks (4–9). The etiology of these growth spurts, which rarely
represents malignant transformation, is not well understood. In
contrast, our understanding of the molecular alterations involved
in initiation of schwannomas has been enhanced by elucidation of
the NF2 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome #22q12, which encodes for the protein Merlin or Schwannomin (10, 11). Merlin is a
65- to 70-kDa protein belonging to the band 4.1 protein superfamily, with implicated roles in establishing cytoskeletal dynamics, cell
growth, ion transport, proliferation, and cell motility. Cell-specific
knockout in Schwann cells supports the critical role of Nf2 in the
initiation of schwannomas (12). In contrast to initiation, the molecular factors that promote the usual indolent growth of schwannomas and the occasional growth spurts are not well studied.
Aberrant expression and activation of growth factors and receptors
are prime candidates and are potential biological targets, which
may be therapeutically exploited to either negate or delay active
intervention in selected cases (13–18).
The clinical use of Gleevec (imatinib mesylate, STI571) was first
shown in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where it inactivated the characteristic bcr-abl oncoprotein, making it the first
and still the best example of the utility of biological targeted therapies in human cancer (19, 20). The demonstration that Gleevec
inhibited the activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as
c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α, and
PDGFR-β (21) has led to its investigation in a variety of human
cancers (22–25).
In this study, we analyzed and showed increased expression and
activation of c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β and their respective
ligands in flash-frozen surgical specimens of sporadic and
NF2-associated human peripheral schwannoma and VS. We then
analyzed the in vitro therapeutic efficacy of Gleevec in the immortalized human NF2-null VS cell line (HEI-193; ref. 26). Gleevec
inhibited cell growth and proliferation while increasing apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest, leading to decreased anchorage-independent
growth. These antitumorigenic effects were associated with decreased activation of c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β and major
downstream effector pathways. Although desirable, these
in vitro results are not readily tested in vivo due to lack of robust
in vivo schwannoma models. However, we suggest that Gleevec,
based on its long clinical track record and associated minimal

toxicity, warrants clinical evaluation in growing and symptomatic
schwannomas.

Materials and Methods
Quantitative Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted (RNAeasy Mini prep kit, Qiagen) from five specimens, normal nerves, traumatic neuroma, NF2-associated VS, NF2 peripheral schwannoma, sporadic VS, sporadic peripheral schwannoma,
plus one stomach and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) specimen.
The flash-frozen surgical specimens were obtained from the research ethic
board–approved tumor bank. RNA (0.2 μg) was subjected to cDNA synthesis using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in 20 μL reactions, diluted to
100 μL using double-distilled water. Two microliters cDNA were used with
the PCR primers for PDGFR-α, PDGF-A, PDGFR-β, PDGF-B, c-kit, stem cell
factor (SCF), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
listed in Supplementary Table S1. Each reaction was set up in triplicate
with 96-well microtitre plates, using the PCR SYBR Green kit and an
Applied Biosystems model 7700 sequence detector. The PCR program
was 94°C for 5 min, 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 1 s for 45
cycles. Expression of the test gene in each specimen was normalized as
the ratio of test gene expression to the level of expression of the GAPDH
gene as a control, followed by a final normalization step of expression
relative to normal nerve. The statistical significance of differences in
expression was discerned by pairwise Student's t test (Fig. 2).

Receptor Expression and Phospho-immunoblot Activation
Assays
Surgical specimens were lysed as described previously (27), and 800 μg
of tissue lysate, measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce Chemical), were incubated overnight at 4°C with 5 μg of respective primary antibody (all from Santa Cruz Biotech): c-kit goat polyclonal, PDGFR-α goat
polyclonal, and PDGFR-β rabbit polyclonal. Protein-G-agarose (Sigma;
100 μL) was added to the preincubated tissue lysates, incubated at 4°C
for 4 h, and processed using standard immunoprecipitation pull-down procedures. The immunoprecipitation tissue pull-down lysates were subjected
to Western blot analyses using 1:1,000 phosphotyrosine primary antibody
(Upstate Biotech) to detect activated receptors or the primary antibodies to
detect total receptor levels, with 1:4,000 protein-G horseradish peroxidase
as the secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). In summary, five such blots were

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (12). June 15, 2009

undertaken, each with lysates from separate controls (normal nerves and
traumatic neuroma), but the same lysate from the single sample of GIST
and normal stomach. Densitometric analyses were undertaken within the
linear range and analyzed with the Fluor-Chem software for each of the five
blots, and the median value was calculated. Fold changes were calculated
by using the P:receptor/total receptor ratio in normal nerves as the standard value of 1 and comparing it to P:receptor/total receptor ratio from
each specimen tested. The statistical significance of differences in expression was evaluated by pairwise Student's t test (Fig. 3).

Tumorigenicity Assays on HEI-193 NF2-Null Human
Schwannoma Cells
Cell viability assay. HEI-193 cells (1 × 103 per well; ref. 26) were plated
in 96-well plates for 24 h, followed by varying concentrations of Gleevec
[vehicle (0 μmol/L), 1, 5, and 10 μmol/L]. Trypan blue dye was added at
24-h intervals (day 1–5), and direct cell counts of both dead (positive)
and viable cells (negative) were undertaken using the Vi-CELL Beckman
Coulter analyzer. The percentage of viable cells (viable/viable + dead)
was plotted against each dose level for days 1 to 5, and normalized to
HEI-193 cells incubated with vehicle alone, representing 100% viability.
HEI-193 cell viability subjected to Gleevec was also evaluated by the
3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HEI-193 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
1 × 103 per well, with Gleevec added (vehicle, 1, 5, and 10 μmol/L) after 24 h.
After every 24 h, the MTS labeling reagent was added, and the absorbance at
490 nm determined 4 h later, for the subsequent 5 d. The corrected absorbance (control blanks) was used to determine the number of live/dead cells.
The mean value from each of six wells with a similar dose of Gleevec was
obtained, and three such independent experiments were undertaken for
both the trypan blue exclusion and MTS assays, with subsequent analysis
using the Student t test (Fig. 4A and B).
Bromodeoxyuridine proliferation assay. HEI-193 cells were seeded at
a density of 1 × 103 per well in 96-well plates for 24 h, followed by Gleevec
and then incubation with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 18 h. BrdUrdpositive cells were evaluated every 24 h (day 1–5) by removing the labeling
solution and addition of 200 μL of FixDenat (Roche Diagnostic) solution for
30 min at room temperature. After removing FixDenat, 100 μL of antiBrdUrd-POD solution were added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with 300 μL/well of washing buffer.

Gleevec, a Candidate Drug for Human Schwannomas
Substrate solution (100 μL) was then added and incubated for 10 min at
room temperature, with the absorbance of the samples measured by an
ELISA reader at 450 nm within 10 min. The average of six wells per Gleevec
dose for three independent experiments was undertaken and values obtained were compared with HEI-193 cells that received only vehicle, with
statistical analysis by Student's t test (Fig. 4C).
Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis. Cell cycle analysis was assessed with
propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) staining and fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). Briefly, cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at
1,500 rpm, and resuspended in propidium iodide solution containing propidium iodide and RNase A and incubated for 40 min at 37°C. After another
centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 500 μL PBS for fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis. Samples were analyzed using the CellQuest
Pro software. Sub-G0 and S-phase subfractions were calculated as averages
of duplicate experiments.
Apoptosis was analyzed by measuring caspase-3/7 activity using the
Apo-One Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) on HEI-193 cells
seeded at a density of 1 × 103 per well in a 96-well plate and subjected
to a one-time dose of Gleevec (vehicle, 1, 5, and 10 μmol/L). After every
24 h, 100 μL of Apo-One were seeded in each well, incubated for 3 h,
and then fluorescence levels were measured (485 Ex/527 Em) for 5 d.
Soft agar clonogenic assay. To the bottom of each 60-mm well plate
were added 1.5 mL of 0.5% agar medium. HEI-193 cells (5 × 103) were suspended in 0.7% low melting point agarose (Cambrex) and dissolved in equal
volume of 2× RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to give a

final agar-cell suspension of 0.35%. After administration of Gleevec, the
agar plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 wk. Anchorage-independent colonies growing in the soft agar were stained with 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma)
and scored (clusters >500 μmol/L) using an inverted microscope. Soft agar
assay was done in triplicate, with two independent experiments analyzed
by Student's t test (Fig. 5).
Western blot analysis. HEI-193 cells were grown in 10% FBS and
treated with varying doses of Gleevec for 2 h, lysed in modified PLC lysis
buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem), and concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. Equal
amounts of whole-cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN) using a
semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed overnight
with activation-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies to PDGFR-α (Upstate
Biotech; Tyr754, 1:500); PDGFR-β (Upstate Biotech; Tyr716, 1:250), c-kit
(Cell Signaling Tech; Tyr719, 1:250), extracellular signal–regulated kinase
(ERK)-1/2 (Santa Cruz; Tyr204, 1:500), AKT (Zymed; Ser473, 1:2,500), p-38
(Cell Signaling Tech; 1:1,500), and Fak (Abcam; Tyr397, 1:1,000). Total receptor levels were derived using non–activation-specific antibodies:
PDGFR-α (Santa Cruz; 1:200); PDGFR-β (Santa Cruz; 1:200), c-kit (Santa
Cruz; 1:100), ERK1/2 (Millipore; 1:2,500), Akt (Cell Signaling Tech;
1:2,500), p-38 (Cell Signaling Tech; 1: 1,000), Fak (Abcam; 1:1,000), and βactin (Sigma; 1:20,000). Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) was used, with visualization using the Chemiluminescence
Reagent Plus (Perkin-Elmer). Densitometric analysis was undertaken for
the phosphorylated/total receptor levels. These experiments were repeated

SCF, PDGF-A, and PDGF-B. The data are
represented as fold change in expression relative
to human normal nerve (NN; n = 5). The median
expression of each specimen (n = 5) was normalized
to GAPDH (not shown), before normalization to the
median value of expression in normal nerves,
which was arbitrarily set at 1. Compared with
expression in normal nerves or benign human
traumatic neuroma (TN; n = 5), there was a
significant increase (P < 0.01) in expression
of all three receptors and ligands in sporadic and
NF2-associated VS and peripheral schwannomas.
A single human GIST (GS) specimen, known to
express the receptors and ligands, served as a
positive control, with corresponding human normal

Figure 3. Increased expression and activation of c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β in sporadic and NF2-associated VS and peripheral schwannomas: One representative
Western immunoblot, from five separate blots, each with a separate normal nerve (NN) and traumatic neuroma (TN) sample as a negative control and four human flash-frozen
schwannoma surgical specimens is shown. SC, sporadic central; SP, sporadic peripheral; NC, NF2-associated central; NP, NF2-associated peripheral. The same sample
of human GIST (GS) and normal stomach (NS) served as a positive control in all five blots. These samples were also analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and
immunohistochemistry in Fig. 2. Levels of P:receptor were expressed as a fraction of the total receptor expression, with the median raw values for this percentage normalized
to the median activation of the receptor in the five normal nerve samples, which was arbitrarily given a value of 1. To further clarify, the median densitometric raw values for
P-c-kit and total c-kit are inserted below the c-kit blot. Levels of activated c-kit, PDGFR-a, and PDGFR-b receptors were elevated in all the schwannomas, compared with
normal nerves and traumatic neuroma (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between central versus peripheral schwannomas or those that occurred in sporadic versus
NF2 patients. The GIST specimen (n = 1) also had elevated levels of activated receptors compared with normal stomach (P < 0.05).

of Gleevec dose analyzed by Student's t test (Fig. 6A).
Activation of downstream effector pathways. Ras-GTP was pulled
down by the use of lysates containing 2 mg protein and glutathione
S-transferase-Ras-binding domain of Raf1 (GST-RBD; Ras Activation assay
Kit, Upstate Biotech; ref. 28). In short, cells were lysed in Mg2+ buffer
containing 10% glycerol and protease and phosphatase inhibitors and then
incubated for 1 h at 4°C with glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to 7.5 μg
of GST-RBD. The beads were then washed thrice in lysis buffer, resuspended, and boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer, and the supernatants subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Ras antibody
(1:500; Upstate Biotech; Fig. 6B).
Western immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates was undertaken by
activation-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies to P-ERK1/2, P-AKT, and
P-Fak (Fig. 6B). The blots were also probed by non–activation-specific
antibodies to derive total receptor levels. All densitometric analyses were
undertaken within the linear range with the AlphaEaseFC software. Fold
changes are calculated by using the vehicle-treated ratio as the standard
value of 1.

Results
Increased Expression and Activation of Receptors in
Human Schwannoma Specimens
Quantitative real-time PCR showed increased expression
(P < 0.05) of Gleevec targeted receptors and their ligands in all
human schwannoma specimens, compared with normal human
nerves (Fig. 2). Levels of receptor/ligand mRNA expression were
slightly elevated in a human traumatic neuroma specimens,

composed of proliferating nontransformed Schwann cells, but
not statistically different (P > 0.05) from normal nerves. A human
GIST tumor and normal human stomach specimen also served as
an internal positive and negative control. Of all three receptor/
ligand combinations tested, PDGFR-α and PDGF-A mRNA was
increased the most in all four groups of human schwannomas
(P < 0.05) compared with normal nerves. However, there was no
statistical difference (P > 0.05) in levels of PDGFR-α, PDGF-A, or
in fact c-kit, or SCF expression between schwannomas, irrespective of whether they were sporadic or NF2 associated.
Phospho-immunoblots for activated receptor/total receptor levels normalized to the value obtained from the normal nerve specimens showed severalfold increased activation of c-kit, PDGFR-α,
and PDGFR-β in all human schwannoma specimens (Fig. 3). Levels
of activated receptors in the nontransformed human traumatic
neuroma were the same as normal nerves. Densitometric analysis
showed highest levels of all three activated receptors in the GIST
specimen (positive control), in keeping with high levels of expression detected at the mRNA level (Fig. 2). Levels of PDGFR-α activation were highest among the three receptors evaluated in all
schwannoma specimens (36- to 40-fold increase). Levels of c-kit
mRNA expression, modestly elevated in NF2-associated peripheral
schwannomas, also corresponded to a comparatively low 8-fold
increase in activation of c-kit. The modest but significant increase
in levels of PDGFR-β mRNA in sporadic vestibular and NF2associated peripheral schwannomas was also reflected by a modest
increase in activated PDGFR-β of 13- and 15-fold, respectively.

Gleevec, a Candidate Drug for Human Schwannomas

Antitumorigenic Effects of Gleevec on Transformed
NF2-Null Human Schwannoma Cells
Reduction in cell viability. HEI-193 human NF2-null schwannoma cells showed decreased cell viability in vitro when subjected
to one-time Gleevec administration in a dose-dependent manner.
As measured by both trypan blue exclusion and MTS assays
(Fig. 4A and B), the percentage of viable HEI-193 cells was
statistically lower after receiving 5 μmol/L Gleevec for all 5 days
analyzed (P < 0.05), with 10 μmol/L Gleevec significantly further
decreasing viability (P < 0.05). With trypan blue exclusion assay,
we extrapolated the IC50 to be 6.25 μmol/L for day 1, 5 μmol/L
for day 3, and 3.25 μmol/L for day 5, compared with values
obtained from vehicle-treated cells only. Similar IC 50 values
were extrapolated with the MTS assay: day 1, 6.25 μmol/L; day 3,
4.50 μmol/L; day 5, 3.8 μmol/L.

Reduction in proliferation. BrdUrd incorporation assay
showed significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the number of proliferating HEI-193 cells after 5 or 10 μmol/L Gleevec (Fig. 4C), with the
greatest reduction with 10 μmol/L Gleevec (P < 0.05). At day 1 after
5 and 10 μmol/L Gleevec administration, there was a reduction of
∼20% and 35% in proliferating rate, respectively, compared with
vehicle. There was an ∼50% reduction in proliferating cells after
5 μmol/L by day 5, whereas it was achieved by day 3 after 10
μmol/L Gleevec. The decrease in cellular proliferation was also supported by decreased number of cells entering S phase, as evidenced
from lower amounts of cells in M3 quadrant (Fig. 4D). This effect on
S phase was also dose and time dependent. For example, there was
an ∼20% reduction in HEI-193 cells at day 1 after 5 μmol/L Gleevec,
with maximal reduction in S-phase cells at day 5 with ∼40% and 42%
reductions in 5 μmol/L– and 10 μmol/L–treated cells, respectively.

Figure 4. Gleevec decreases growth and increases apoptosis of NF2-null HEI-193 human VS cells. A, viability of HEI-193 cells after single administration of varying doses
of Gleevec was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion from day 1 to day 5 and plotted as a percentage of HEI-193 cells receiving vehicle control (0 μmol/L Gleevec).
Points, mean value of three wells. There was a significant (P < 0.01) dose-dependent decrease even after day 1 of either 5 μmol/L (*) or 10 μmol/L (**) Gleevec
administration. B, viability of HEI-193 cells was also evaluated by MTS assay after single administration of Gleevec at varying doses from day 1 to day 5 and plotted as a
percentage of cells treated with vehicle only. Columns, mean of six replicate wells from three independent experiments. The number of viable HEI-193 cells decreased
at 5 (*) or 10 μmol/L (**), commencing from day 1 to day 5 (P < 0.01). C, BrdUrd proliferation assay on HEI-193 cells also showed decreased proliferation from day 1 to
day 5 after single Gleevec administration. Significant (P < 0.01) decrease in proliferation was found at 5 μmol/L (*) or 10 μmol/L (**) Gleevec. Columns, average of six
replicates from three replicate administration experiments. D, cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide flow cytometry was undertaken day 1 to day 5 after single administration
of Gleevec in HEI-193 cells. There was an increase in the sub-G0 phase, representing apoptotic cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, there was a
decrease in the number of cells entering S phase. Sub-G0 and S-phase subfractions were calculated as averages of duplicate experiments. E, caspase-3/7 activity showed
significant (P < 0.01) increase in both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in HEI-193 cells at day 1 after 5 (*) or 10 μmol/L (**) single Gleevec administration.

Figure 5. Gleevec decreases the
in vitro tumorigenicity of human
NF2-null HEI-193 schwannoma cells:
Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar
was undertaken with different doses of
Gleevec, and colonies were counted at
days 18 and 21. Gleevec significantly
(*, P < 0.05) decreased the number of
anchorage-independent colonies of
HEI-193 cells equally after 5 and 10 μmol/L
doses.

Induction of apoptosis. Administration of Gleevec to HEI-193
cells increased apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner,
as determined by both caspase-3/7 activity and cell cycle flow cytometry. Gleevec administration led to increase in caspase-3/7
activity with significant induction (P < 0.01) in 5 or 10 μmol/L
Gleevec–treated cells, compared with vehicle- or 1 μmol/L–treated
cells (Fig. 4E). The induction of apoptosis was seen as early as day 1
and increased with time after Gleevec. There was no significant
difference in caspase-3/7 activity between 5 and 10 μmol/L Gleevec–
treated HEI-193 cells, for any of the time points, although it was
consistently higher in the 10 μmol/L–treated cells. The induction
of apoptosis as measured by caspase-3/7 activity was also supported by an increase in the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase after
Gleevec exposure (Fig. 4D). This increase was observed as early as
day 1, and by day 5 up to ∼25% of the cells were in the sub-G0 phase
with either 5 or 10 μmol/L Gleevec. Although the increase in sub-G0
phase was slightly higher in HEI-193 cells treated with 10 μmol/L
Gleevec, it was not significantly different from those subjected to
5 μmol/L Gleevec.
Reduction in soft agar colonies. Soft agar assay using HEI-193
cells showed significant reduction in the number of anchorageindependent colonies formed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5).
As evaluated and quantified on days 18 and 21, significant (P <
0.001) reduction in soft agar colonies was detected after 5 or
10 μmol/L Gleevec, compared with the vehicle control or cells treated with 1 μmol/L Gleevec. There was no statistical difference
between the 5 or 10 μmol/L Gleevec doses in terms of colony
numbers, although the sizes of the colonies were reduced with
10 μmol/L Gleevec (Fig. 5).
Reduction in activation of targeted receptors. Quantification
of phosphorylation specific immunoblot assays, normalized to total amount of receptor expressed, showed reduction of c-kit,
PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β activation to varying degrees by Gleevec
(Fig. 6A). These assays were undertaken 2 hours after administration of Gleevec to HEI-193 cells growing in 10% FBS. Similar to the
quantitative real-time PCR data (Fig. 2) and the receptor activa-

tion data (Fig. 3) on human schwannoma specimens, the HEI193 cells expressed abundant amounts of all three receptors,
which were also highly activated. Expression and activation of
PDGFR-α was the highest among the receptors in the HEI-193
cells, similar to our findings in the surgical schwannoma specimens (Fig. 3). Activation of all three receptors was significantly
(P < 0.01) reduced after 5 and 10 μmol/L Gleevec, with highest reduction at 10 μmol/L dose (P < 0.05). For example, activation of
PDGFR-α was decreased by ∼80% at 5 μmol/L and >90% at
10 μmol/L Gleevec. At 1 μmol/L Gleevec, PDGFR-β activation
was inhibited by ∼70%, but this dose did not significantly
(P > 0.05) inhibit PDGFR-α or c-kit activation.
Inhibition of effector pathways after Gleevec administration. Activity assays 2 hours after Gleevec administration to
HEI-193 cells inhibited several key protumorigenic effector pathways involved in proliferation (Ras-GTP and P-ERK1/2), cell survival (P-Akt), and migration (P-Fak; Fig. 6B). Fold changes were
calculated by normalizing the mean of the two vehicle-treated
samples to 1, with experiments repeated thrice. There was a
dose-dependent reduction in all four effector pathways examined,
although to variable extents. After 10 μmol/L Gleevec, Ras-GTP
level was 0.33, P-ERK1/2 level was 0.53, P-Akt level was 0.41, and
P-Fak was 0.27, compared with vehicle controls. This inhibition
of effector pathways was statistically significant at P < 0.01 by
Student's t test.

Discussion
Human schwannomas usually grow in an indolent manner,
causing symptoms by compression of adjacent vital structures
usually without malignant progression (Fig. 1). They usually arise
sporadically in adults, but can arise as multiple tumors early in life
in cancer predisposition syndromes such as NF2 and NF3 (also
known as schwannomatosis; ref. 29). On occasion, the growth of
schwannomas can accelerate and lead to clinical symptoms (3),
a scenario that is more critical in NF2 patients harboring multiple

Gleevec, a Candidate Drug for Human Schwannomas

intracranial schwannomas (Fig. 1). Currently, actively growing and
clinically symptomatic schwannomas are managed with surgery or
radiosurgery, each with some short- and long-term risks (4–9). A
management alternative that could blunt or regress the growth
of the schwannoma, and be taken on a prolonged basis, would
potentially stabilize the clinical symptoms and defray active
intervention, especially in high-risk patients.
Gleevec was the first targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor to show
efficacy in the clinic, revolutionizing the current management of
CML harboring the bcr-abl oncogene (19–21). Gleevec blocks the
kinase activity of abl and inhibits the growth of bcr-abl–driven cell
lines in vitro with an IC50 of 1 μmol/L (21). This concentration is
readily achieved in vivo, with minimal host toxicity. In addition to
its minimal toxicity, Gleevec inhibits other receptor tyrosine
kinases such as c-kit and PDGFRs, thereby expanding its potential
use in other human cancers. For example, Gleevec has shown
clinical efficacy in the management of GIST, characterized by
c-kit mutational activation or, rarely, PDGFR-α mutational activation (23). Gleevec has also shown efficacy in c-kit–positive smallcell lung cancer cell lines (25), PDGFR-expressing glioblastoma
cells (24), and other myeloproliferative disorders characterized by
activation of PDGFRβ (22).
Schwannomas do not harbor the bcr-abl oncogenic translocation, but expression of PDGFRs and growth factors has been previously noted (13–18). To determine if c-kit, PDGFR-α, and
PDGFR-β are expressed, activated, and play a functional role in

promoting growth, we used human surgical schwannoma specimens as well as the HEI-193 immortalized human schwannoma
cell line. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis on peripheral schwannoma and VS removed from sporadic and NF2 patients showed
increased mRNA expression of all the three Gleevec targeted receptors and their respective ligands (Fig. 2). Phosphotyrosine immunoblots on tumor lysates showed increased expression and
activation of all three receptors compared with normal nerve
(Fig. 3). Expression and activation of c-kit was moderately increased, compared with the high expression and activation of
PDGFR-α in all the schwannoma specimens. There was variable
increase in PDGFR-β expression and activation, with relatively
lower levels in sporadic VS and NF2 peripheral schwannomas,
the reason for which is not currently clear. Of interest, expression
of Merlin in the NF2-null HEI-193 cells results in decreased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase and tumorigenic growth, which partly may be mediated
by increasing degradation of cell-surface receptors such as
PDGFR (30). Although not statistically significant, there was a
trend toward increased expression and activation of all three
receptors in the NF2-associated VS, including PDGFR-β, as previously noted in primary schwannoma cultures (13). The expression
and activation profile of c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β, in addition
to being increased compared with normal human nerve specimens, was also elevated when compared with human traumatic
neuroma specimens, the latter implying that the increase in

was administered at varying doses to HEI-193 cells for 2 h and then Western immunoblot analysis of whole-cell lysates was undertaken with activation-specific
phosphotyrosine antibodies. The blots were also probed by non–activation-specific antibodies to derive total receptor levels and β-actin as loading control. Densitometric
evaluation showed significant inhibition (60–90%; P < 0.01) of c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β at 5 (*) or 10 μmol/L (**) Gleevec. The 1 μmol/L dose inhibited PDGFR-β
activation by ∼70%, but did not significantly (P > 0.05) inhibit PDGFR-α or c-kit activation. B, Gleevec at varying doses was administered to HEI-193 cells for 2 h,
and then p21-Ras activity (Ras-GTP pull-down assay, Upstate Biotech) and P-ERK1/2, P-Akt, and P-Fak levels were measured and normalized to total levels of the
respective proteins to obtain activity levels by densitometry. Fold changes were calculated by using the mean of the two vehicle-treated samples (arbitrarily 1) and
analyzed using Student's t test. There was a significant dose-dependent inhibition of all these four major effector pathways analyzed.

c-kit, PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β expression is not associated with
proliferating Schwann cells, but rather linked to transformation
to schwannomas.
The immortalized HEI-193 cells were derived from a VS in a NF2
patient and immortalized with human papillomavirus E6-E7 viral
genes (26). Recently, a point mutation has been identified in the
NF2 gene of the HEI-193 cells, resulting in a nonfunctional Merlin
with attenuated tumor-suppressive function (31). Although the
HEI-193 cells have been noted to have increased proliferative capacity in vitro, they do not grow as in vivo xenografts. Our group has
also attempted to grow explant xenografts from NF2-associated or
sporadic schwannomas used in this study, without success. The
increased receptor expression and activation profile for c-kit,
PDGFR-α, and PDGFR-β in HEI-193 cells was similar to our
characterization of the human NF2 VS operative specimens
(Figs. 3 and 6), validating their use for the functional experiments
undertaken (Figs. 4–6). Although schwannoma cell lines and HEI193 cells specifically have been linked with increased PDGFR
expression (13, 18, 32), our study is the first to decipher the profile of c-kit as a well-recognized target of Gleevec.
Cumulatively, our results show the in vitro antitumorigenic effects of one-time administration of Gleevec on HEI-193 schwannoma cells. This results from a decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4A and
B), cell proliferation with a block at S phase (Fig. 4C and D), and an
increase in apoptosis as measured by an increase in the sub-G0
phase and caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 4D and E). These multiple antitumorigenic mechanisms of Gleevec has been noted in other human cancer cell lines, including bcr-abl–positive hematopoietic
cells, GIST, dermatofibrosarcoma, and PDGFR-expressing glioblastoma cells (23, 24, 33, 34). These experiments were done in the
presence of 10% serum with an extrapolated IC50 of ∼5 μmol/L
Gleevec (Fig. 4A and B), which is higher than the 1 μmol/L found
in CML and GIST cell lines (21), but lower than those reported in
other human cancer cells such as neuroblastoma (9–13 μmol/L)
and Ewing's sarcoma (10–12 μmol/L; refs. 35, 36). The 5 μmol/L
Gleevec used in our study is in fact similar to the 4.6 μmol/L obtained in serum from the early reported successful clinical trials in
CML (19, 20). However, the maximal tolerated or effective dose of
Gleevec is likely higher than these early trials in CML, with the desired effective dose likely varying with the targeted cancer and patient profile, an area of ongoing clinical investigations (37, 38). The
5 and 10 μmol/L doses were equally effective in decreasing anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Fig. 5). The 5 and 10 μmol/L
doses both effectively decreased phosphorylation activation of all
three receptors, with the higher dose being slightly more effective
(Fig. 6A). These results are similar to the doses reported to inhibit
PDGFR phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells transfected to express
PDGFRs (39). Decreased activation of these receptors correlated

with inhibition of four key signaling pathways (Ras-GTP, PERK1/1, P-AKT, and P-Fak), which are well known to be aberrant
in tumorigenic cells (Fig. 6B). In addition to these three receptors
and major downstream effector pathways, other molecular mechanisms of the antitumorigenic effects of Gleevec likely exist,
some of which may play a dominant role and act by in vivo methods such as on angiogenesis (40–42).
In summary, our results support Gleevec as having antitumorigenic effect on human schwannomas in vitro. Majority of schwannomas will not require any intervention other than clinical and
radiologic follow-up due to their indolent but progressive growth.
However, a few, such as those impinging on vital structures such as
the spinal cord or brainstem and especially schwannomas associated with the NF2 or NF3 predisposition syndromes, will require
active intervention. Surgery or radiosurgical intervention in this
latter group of patients and those who are elderly or have significant concomitant medical issues may be significant. It is these patients who may benefit from chronic administration of a biological
therapy with established low toxicity. For example, in NF2 patients,
prolonged hearing preservation is a prime management objective
due to the bilateral nature of the VS in addition to often multiple
other schwannomas. Although in specialized centers technical improvements have occurred in surgery and radiosurgery to minimize risks, there still exists significant limitation in our ability to
preserve long-term hearing, in addition to small but potential critical risks such as radiation-induced carcinogenesis (4–9). This
study is limited by its in vitro nature due to lack of readily available
xenograft or transgenic models of schwannomas. However, based
on almost a decade of experience using Gleevec often with chronic
administration, we feel that the presented preclinical data warrant
further investigation of Gleevec in phase1/2 clinical trials of human
schwannomas with shown radiologic and/or clinical progression.
