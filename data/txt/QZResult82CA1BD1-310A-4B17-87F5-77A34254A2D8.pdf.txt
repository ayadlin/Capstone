Impact of Hepatitis C Virus Eradication on
Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis
Darrick K. Li, MD, PhD1; and Raymond T. Chung, MD1,2

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Infection with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) represents one of the most common risk factors for HCC development, and cases of HCV-related complications have been rising over the last 2 decades. Although the standard for HCV therapy has been interferon (IFN)-based for many years, the therapeutic
revolution spurred by the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) promises to usher in a new era in which chronic HCV
becomes a rare disease. On the basis of long-term follow-up of patients experiencing IFN-based sustained virological responses
(SVRs), it can be expected that rates of HCV-associated HCC will decrease significantly after the widespread adoption of DAAs, but
there remains a persistent risk for HCC even among some patients with advanced fibrosis who have achieved SVR. As such, individuals treated for HCV with advanced fibrosis should continue to be screened regularly for HCC after SVR. Furthermore, as the population of SVR patients grows, it will become imperative to accurately identify those individuals at high risk for developing HCC,
appropriately allocate resources for screening, and consider cost-effective chemopreventive strategies. Risk factors include preexisting advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, older age, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol use. In addition, laboratory biomarkers and genetic signatures are currently being identified that not only predict the likelihood of HCC development in SVR patients but also may serve as

INTRODUCTION
Primary liver cancer, of which hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the most common histologic type, is one of the
most common malignancies worldwide and constitutes 5.6% of all cancers.1 Although it is the fifth most common cancer
globally, it is also the second most common cause of cancer death.1 Although survival rates for HCC have been improving
over the last 30 years, they remain quite poor despite improvements in surveillance programs and therapeutic options. The
5-year survival rate currently stands at approximately 15% in the United States,2 but it is only approximately 5% in
resource-poor countries.3 In the United States, HCC was the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death in men and
women between 1992 and 2010,2 although recent studies suggest that the rate of the rise in its incidence may be slowing.4
Still, an estimated 33,000 new cases of HCC and 23,000 HCC-related deaths occurred in 2014 in the United States alone.5
One of the most significant risk factors for the development of HCC is chronic infection with hepatitis C virus
(HCV). In the United States, 1.3% of the population, or 3.2 million people, are thought to have chronic HCV, and many
are not aware that they are infected.6 Unlike hepatitis B virus, which directly integrates into the genetic material of the cell,
HCV is an RNA virus with a purely cytoplasmic life cycle. HCV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis is thought to be multifactorial and arise from direct viral oncogenic effects as well as mutagenic insults to the hepatocyte genome accumulated
from rounds of inflammation and fibrosis associated with chronic viral infection.7 HCV infection itself is associated with
a 15- to 20-fold increased risk of HCC development; observational data suggest an annual incidence of HCC in individuals with HCV-associated cirrhosis of 1% to 5%.8 Forecasting models predict that without treatment, 14.4% of all patients
with HCV would develop HCC.9 Thus, without further advances in screening or therapeutics, the incidence of HCC will
continue to climb in the coming decades.
The goal of HCV therapy has been to achieve permanent clearance of the virus (reflected by the undetectability of
HCV RNA with highly sensitive assays), also known as a sustained virological response (SVR). SVR has been shown to be

associated with dramatic reductions in all-cause mortality
and the progression of liver disease.10 The therapeutic
landscape of HCV has undergone a sea change with the
recent introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents
(DAAs) and with the approval of all-oral, interferon
(IFN)-free DAA regimens that now promise superb
(>90%) SVR rates.11 As such, the rates of HCVassociated complications, including HCC, are expected to
decrease in the near future. In this review, we discuss the
latest advances in HCV therapeutics, the impact of established IFN-based strategies on HCC incidence, risk factors for developing HCC after SVR, and how the arrival
of DAAs and IFN-free regimens will affect the surveillance and management of patients at risk and with HCC
in the near future.
RISE OF DAAS IN HCV TREATMENT
Since its introduction in 1986, IFN-based therapy has
been the backbone of HCV therapy. However, despite the
advancement and refinement of IFN-based regimens over
2 decades, SVR rates of only 55% were observed.12 Furthermore, the regimen itself was poorly tolerated, and
SVR rates varied with genotype and viral load.
Significant advances in our understanding of the
molecular virology, life cycle, and pathogenesis of HCV
led directly to the development of the first DAAs. These
agents were the first-generation nonstructural protein 34A (NS3-4A) protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, which achieved SVR rates of 65% to 75% when they
were used together with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)
and ribavirin.13,14 As such, they were approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in triple
therapy for HCV genotype 1 in 2011. Their approval was
followed by the development of several compounds targeting other stages of the HCV life cycle. Simeprevir, a
once daily NS3-4A protease inhibitor, was approved in
2013 to be used in combination with PEG-IFN and ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1; it achieved
SVR rates comparable to those of its predecessors with
better tolerability.15 A major advance was the development of an NS5B polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir is a member of a family of nucleotide analogues that
work by causing early chain termination after their incorporation into newly synthesized viral RNA.16 Because of
its mechanism of action and the conservation of the NS5B
RNA polymerase active site, it is active against all HCV
genotypes and has a high barrier to resistance; it selects
only for viral mutants with exceedingly low replication fitness. As such, in a landmark trial enrolling individuals
who predominantly had HCV genotype 1 or 4,
Cancer

sofosbuvir-anchored triple therapy was found to achieve a
90% rate of a sustained virological response after 12 weeks
of therapy (SVR12).17 Moreover, SVR12 rates of 95%
and 82% were attained with sofosbuvir and ribavirin
alone in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced persons, respectively, with HCV genotype 2 or 3.17,18
Accordingly, in 2013, the FDA approved sofosbuvir for
use as part of triple therapy for HCV genotypes 1 and 4
and with ribavirin alone for genotypes 2 and 3.
Of particular interest has been the development of
all-oral, IFN-free regimens using 2 or more classes of
DAAs to achieve the dual goal of rapid viral suppression
and the prevention of selection of resistant variants. This
concept was realized with the approval of sofosbuvir and
ledipasvir (an NS5A inhibitor) by the FDA in October
2014 as a once daily coformulation for the treatment of
HCV genotype 1. This was done on the basis of 3 pivotal
trials that studied this combination with and without ribavirin in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced
patients. These clinical studies found that regardless of
ribavirin use, individuals treated with this combination
achieved SVR12 rates of 94% to 99%.19-21 In addition,
sofosbuvir and simeprevir for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 were approved by the FDA in November 2014
on the basis of results from the COSMOS trial, which
demonstrated >90% SVR12 rates and good safety and
tolerability profiles.22 Finally, the combination regimen
of ombitasvir (NS5A inhibitor), ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir (NS3-4A protease inhibitor), dasabuvir (nonnucleoside NS5B inhibitor), and ribavirin was approved in
December 2014 on the basis of several trials showing
SVR12 rates > 90%.23,24 Several other drugs have been
recently approved as part of new regimens (see Table 1),
and still others are currently in late-phase clinical trials.
Published data regarding real-world experience with
the new DAA regimens are scarce at this time. However, preliminary data from the HCV-TARGET group, a multicenter consortium prospectively characterizing the outcomes of
practices in North America and Europe, paint an encouraging picture. Individuals with HCV genotype 1 who were
treated with sofosbuvir and simeprevir with or without ribavirin experienced SVR rates similar to those seen in clinical
trials (SVR rate 90% after 4 weeks of therapy) as well as
very low rates of viral breakthrough, discontinuation, and serious adverse effects.28 In the near future, we should expect
to have comparable real-world data regarding the efficacy
and safety profiles of other DAA regimens.
Current areas of active investigation include expanding the reach of DAA-based treatment to patients with
other HCV genotypes, HCV/human immunodeficiency

virus–coinfected patients, persons with decompensated
cirrhosis, and those experiencing HCV infection after
liver transplantation. Promising data for all-oral DAA
combinations in each of these groups have been published
or presented. In the coming years, we can anticipate that
the landscape of HCV therapeutics will continue to rapidly evolve.
RISK REDUCTION OF HCC IN INDIVIDUALS
ACHIEVING SVR WITH IFN-BASED
THERAPIES
The achievement of SVR is a critical point in the progression of disease for individuals with chronic HCV infection. Recent studies investigating long-term clinical
endpoints have found that for patients with all stages of fibrosis, SVR is associated with marked reductions in allcause mortality,29 the progression of fibrosis,30 the need
for liver transplantation,10 extrahepatic complications,31
and hepatocarcinogenesis.
The link between chronic HCV infection and HCC
was observed in the mid-1980s. Shortly after the identification of HCV, researchers in Europe and Asia reported
the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies in 58% to 75% of
patients with HCC whose liver disease had previously
been associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis.32 However,
direct evidence of the benefits of antiviral therapy with
respect to hepatocarcinogenesis were not apparent until
Nishiguchi et al33 directly addressed this question with a
randomized control trial. In that study, 90 Japanese
patients with chronic HCV infection and compensated
cirrhosis were randomized 1:1 to IFN monotherapy or
symptomatic therapy and followed prospectively. After a
2876

mean observation period of 4.4 years for treated patients
and 5.5 years for controls, only 2 treated patients developed HCC, whereas 17 controls did (relative risk, 0.067;
P 5 .01). Long-term follow-up of the same cohort
revealed a continued reduction in HCC development
among treated patients (relative risk, 0.244; P < .001),
and this suggested a durable amelioration of hepatocarcinogenic risk after antiviral therapy.34 Since then, several
long-term observational and retrospective studies have
corroborated these initial findings, although most of these
studies have been performed in Japan, where the prevalence of HCV-associated HCC is higher.35
In a more contemporary, multicenter, long-term follow-up study performed in Europe, 530 patients with
biopsy-proven advanced fibrosis who were treated with
IFN monotherapy, IFN and ribavirin, or PEG-IFN and
ribavirin were followed for a median duration of 8.4 years.
In addition to a significant improvement in the all-cause
mortality rate for patients with SVR (hazard ratio [HR],
0.26; P < .001), significantly fewer individuals with SVR
developed HCC in comparison with nonresponders (HR,
0.19; P < .001).10 Similarly, a recent systematic metaanalysis synthesized the results from 30 observational
studies performed in Asia, Europe, Canada, and the
United States and assessed the risk of HCC among HCVinfected persons treated with IFN-based therapy. Evaluating 25,906 participants with follow-up ranging from 3.0
to 8.2 years, the meta-analysis found that among those
who attained SVR, 1.5% developed HCC, whereas 6.2%
of individuals who did not attain SVR developed HCC
(adjusted HR, 0.24). In a subanalysis examining patients
with advanced liver disease, 4.2% of responders developed

HCC, whereas 17.8% of nonresponders did.36 The
authors argued that this would suggest that although the
treatment of HCV at earlier stages of disease is more efficient for HCC prevention, more cases of HCC are prevented when individuals with advanced liver disease
achieve SVR. In both studies, HCC was defined by histopathologic confirmation or by characteristic imaging findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance
imaging, or contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ie, arterialphase enhancement) in the setting of markedly elevated
and/or increasing a-fetoprotein (AFP).
The suppressive effect of antiviral therapy has also
been evaluated in the setting of curative resection of
HCV-associated HCC. Although it has long been known
that IFN therapy does not represent a viable option as a
therapy for HCC, emerging data suggest that IFN therapy may be beneficial in preventing HCC recurrence after a viral cure. A recent single-center study evaluating
178 patients who underwent PEG-IFN/ribavirin combination therapy after curative treatment for HCV-related
HCC found significant reductions in HCC recurrence,
particularly in those who achieved SVR.37 A metaanalysis of 14 studies encompassing 1385 patients
addressed the same question by examining the utility of
IFN-based adjuvant therapy after curative resection or
ablation of HCV-associated HCC.38 The authors found
that in HCV-associated HCC, IFN treatment reduced
mortality (relative risk, 0.44; P < .00001) and decreased
HCC recurrence by approximately 30%. There is also
preliminary evidence that IFN-based therapy before surgical resection helps to decrease HCC recurrence rates.39
The mechanism by which IFN is able to provide additional benefit, particularly after the procedure, is unclear.
It is likely a combination of both the antiproliferative
effects and the direct antiviral effects of IFN. Furthermore, IFN has direct antitumor effects, including the
induction of proapoptotic genes via mechanisms not limited to upregulation of tumor suppressors, inhibition of
angiogenesis, and upregulation of antitumor immune
responses.40 IFN-a, the principal IFN class used in HCV
treatment, has been shown to upregulate natural killer
cell activity and increase circulating levels of T helper
lymphocytes and thereby augment the antitumor
response by both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms.41 Interestingly, IFN-k, whose receptors are primarily expressed on hepatocytes, has been shown to have
multiple antitumor effects, including upregulation of
CD8 T-cell and natural killer cell expression and function in mouse models.42 As such, IFN-k has recently
become a subject of interest as a novel tool for the treatCancer

ment of HCV and HCC. Whether similar pleomorphic
benefits will be observed with DAA-based treatment,
which have antiviral effects but no clear direct antitumor
or anti-inflammatory effects, remains an open question.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether or not such therapy
will benefit patients who already have late-stage or metastatic HCC because of their ineligibility for curative
interventions.
In general, there are limitations to the data supporting long-term benefits of SVR related to HCC
development. These include the use of predominantly
observational and retrospective methods and the inherent biases that attend these approaches. Further weaknesses include the use of small cohorts, single-center
studies, and insufficient follow-up time because of the
gradual and asymptomatic pathogenesis of HCVrelated liver disease, which is often measured in decades. Many of these studies have also been from Japan,
where HCC incidence rates are significantly higher
than those in the United States/Europe.43
Nevertheless, the data over the past 2 decades
clearly demonstrate that the achievement of SVR is
associated with a significant decrease in the risk of
HCC development. Moreover, antiviral therapy can act
as tertiary prophylaxis and reduce the risk of HCC recurrence after curative resection or transplantation.
With the high SVR rates achieved with DAA-based
regimens, the overall incidence of HCC can thus be
expected to continue to decrease. However, there still
remains a nonzero risk of hepatocarcinogenesis that has
been consistently observed in many studies. The cumulative HCC incidence in SVR patients 5 and 10 years
after SVR has ranged in recent studies from 2.3% to
8.8% and from 3.1% to 11.1%, respectively.35 In a
prospective, multicenter study that evaluated the longterm effects of IFN-based therapy, the authors found
that 50% of those with SVR who developed HCC had
HCC discovered 7 or more years after they had been
cleared of the virus.44 Isolated reports of HCC developing as long as 13 years after the achievement of SVR
have been published.45 This strongly suggests that for
select individuals, despite the resolution of the initial
infection, there remains an elevated risk of hepatocarcinogenesis in comparison with healthy individuals.
RISK FACTORS FOR HCC IN PATIENTS
WITH SVR
Because of the continued risk of hepatocarcinogenesis
even after SVR, it is critical to be able to identify those
individuals at highest risk so that we can intervene with

more aggressive screening and follow-up. This is especially
true on account of the increasing number of patients who
will achieve SVR with DAA-based regimens.
There have been many studies identifying predictors
for HCC development in patients with chronic HCV infection, but fewer have sought to identify predictors of HCC
development in patients after SVR achievement. The most
well-established risk factor for developing HCC after SVR
in HCV patients is advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.46 HCC
rarely develops in the setting of HCV infection in the absence of cirrhosis. Consistent with this, a subgroup analysis
of trials enrolling only patients with advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis found that 4.2% of these patients who had achieved
SVR developed HCC, whereas 1.5% did when trials that enrolled individuals with all stages of fibrosis were analyzed.36
There are also emerging data showing that patients with
underlying diabetes mellitus are at higher risk for HCC after
SVR.47 This may reflect the independent risk for HCC development incurred in patients with diabetes, although the
mechanism by which this occurs is unclear and likely complex. Several other risk factors, including older age, male sex,
and ethanol use, have also been consistently associated with
HCC development in SVR patients.35
In an effort to guide the prediction of high-risk SVR
patients, several laboratory biomarkers have been identified to predict the likelihood of hepatocarcinogenesis in
these patients. For example, in one study of 140 SVR
patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis
(HALT-C) trial, the authors found that the pre-IFN treatment platelet count, alkaline phosphatase, and older age
were significantly associated with HCC development.48
Researchers have also identified posttreatment alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and AFP as possibly important
biomarkers. In one study, a posttreatment ALT level < 40
U/L and an AFP level < 6.0 ng/mL were identified as having high negative predictive values for HCC development.
These markers identified those at high risk for developing
HCC among SVR patients and nonresponders.49 In
another study, older age and a posttreatment AFP level > 5 ng/mL measured 24 weeks after IFN treatment
were significantly predictive of the development of HCC
in both SVR patients and nonresponders.50 A recent retrospective study of patients without cirrhosis reported
that an elevated Fibrosis 4 index51 (a predictor of liver fibrosis using a composite ALT/aspartate aminotransferase/
age/platelet count value) with an SVR after 24 weeks of
therapy was also predictive of HCC development in SVR
patients.52 Table 2 summarizes risk factors that have been
identified for HCC incidence in patients with SVR. Mov2878

ing forward, further studies identifying risk factors and
suitable biomarkers for identifying SVR patients at higher
risk of HCC development will be needed, particularly in
Western populations because the vast majority of investigations to date have been performed in Asia.
In recent years, the availability of high-throughput
sequencing and gene expression profiling methodologies
has fueled an emerging effort to identify genetic biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes for patients at
high likelihood for developing complications of cirrhosis.
Gene expression profiling was performed on fixed tissues
from livers of patients who underwent surgical resection
of primary HCC. This analysis identified a reproducible
186-gene signature that correlated with survival.59 Interestingly, molecular analysis also suggested that the signature might reflect the field defect in the cirrhotic liver, in
which recurrent HCC arises from a favorable microenvironment. This genetic signature was also prospectively
studied in individuals with HCV-related, Child-Pugh
class A cirrhosis. Liver biopsy samples were obtained from
patients who were subsequently followed for a median of
10 years. A genetic signature predicted to have a poor
prognosis was found to be significantly associated not
only with mortality (HR, 2.77; P 5 .004) but also with
progression to advanced cirrhosis (HR, 3.79; P < .001)
and the development of HCC (HR, 2.65; P 5 .009).60
These data suggest that the 186-gene signature is a sensitive
predictor of clinical deterioration even in early-stage cirrhosis and may identify those high-risk patients who would be
most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention.
Repeat biopsy and re-evaluation of the genetic signature after therapy could also serve as a method for identifying
those at persistent risk for HCC. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in several genes, including epidermal growth
factor, patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3,
and interleukin 28B, have also been identified that are associated with clinical deterioration, including HCC development, in HCV-associated cirrhosis.61 It remains to be seen
whether similar single-nucleotide polymorphisms or other
genetic markers will be able to identify patients at risk of
further clinical deterioration after SVR.
SCREENING, CHEMOPREVENTION, AND
CONCLUSIONS
Current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines for HCC surveillance recommend that
patients with chronic HCV and cirrhosis be screened with
ultrasonography every 6 months.62 Notably, AFP is not
recommended as a screening tool because of its poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. However, it is unclear

whether or not to continue screening individuals who
have achieved SVR. Because the risk of disease progression, including HCC development, is reduced but not
eliminated after viral clearance, we recommend continuing regular screening with ultrasonography even after successful treatment. Whether posttreatment AFP will be
incorporated into post-SVR screening will depend on the
reproducibility of some of the preliminary studies
described previously, which suggest a predictive benefit of
this value for the development of post-SVR HCC. No
direct prospective comparison of regular post-SVR screening and usual care has been performed. However, in a
retrospective cohort study of 562 patients with SVR, the
5-year survival rate for those who received regular HCC
screening (ultrasonography at least every 6 months) was
93%, whereas it was 60% for those who did not.
However, surveillance is thought to be costeffective in patients with cirrhosis only if the annual
HCC incidence is 1.5% per year, a rate higher than
most estimates for patients with SVR.36 This is further
complicated by the fact that the population of SVR
patients will rapidly expand in the coming decades with
Cancer

the advent of DAA-based therapeutic strategies. The
medical community has already had difficulty implementing successful screening for routinely warranted
cases. Only 12% of new HCV-related HCC cases are
diagnosed through screening in the United States,63 and
less than 20% of patients with cirrhosis who develop
HCC have undergone regular surveillance; this highlights the challenges that clinicians already face in the
management of these patients.64 For all these reasons, it
will be crucial to identify those who would benefit most
from continued screening to allocate resources in a costeffective manner. These will likely include patients with
pretreatment cirrhosis, older patients, patients with diabetes, and others identified by laboratory and genetic
biomarkers.
Chemopreventive strategies will also be a significant
consideration in the management of patients at risk for
developing HCC. For example, low-dose maintenance
IFN43 after a course of typical IFN-based treatment has
been evaluated in large-scale randomized trials in an effort
to prevent further prevent disease progression and HCC
development. However, the relative inefficacy and poor
2879

Review Article

tolerability of long-term IFN-based regimens have made
it a nonviable chemopreventive candidate. Other chemoprevention strategies have been investigated to prevent the
development of HCC in patients after curative treatment
with antiviral therapy, and these include glycyrrhizin and
ursodeoxycholic acid. However, these have produced limited results in small studies.65
Ultimately, the decision to implement screening or
chemopreventive strategies for patients with chronic
HCV and patients with SVR will require an integrated
evaluation of each patient’s risk factors. Ideally, the decision can be aided by a prognostic index that evaluates
patient characteristics, including laboratory biomarkers
and their molecular (186-gene) signature. Moreover, a
cost-effectiveness analysis has suggested that the 186-gene
signature enables personalized HCC surveillance with
reduced aggregate medical care costs and extended patient
life expectancy.60 One such prognostic index was recently
validated: it accurately predicts the risk of clinical deterioration in patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis,
including liver-related mortality, hepatic decompensation, and HCC.66 It is hoped that the signature can soon
yield plausible circulating markers that can be examined
from patient sera.
The ascendant era of DAA-centered HCV therapeutics will likely stem the rising tide of chronic HCV
infection in the near future and thus lower the incidence
of HCV-related complications, including HCC.
Unfortunately, economic barriers to achieving this goal
remain at this point because of the prohibitively high
upfront cost of these therapies (Table 2). However,
recent economic analyses suggest that the current price of
DAA-based treatment for genotype 1 patients and for
treatment-experienced patients with genotypes 2 and 3
may be cost-effective when one considers quality of life
and the overall saved costs of future hospitalizations for
HCV-related complications.67,68 Supporting this notion,
a population-based study from Canada reported significant health care–related costs associated with HCC with
an estimated mean 5-year net cost of care of $77,509.
Given the estimated 33,000 new cases in the United
States in 2014, HCC-associated care represents a $2.5
billion strain on the medical system. Thus, chemopreventive approaches to HCC, including HCV treatment,
are likely cost-effective as long as they are reasonably
priced and safe because the economic cost of HCC is so
high with respect to survival cost and the need for transplantation or locoregional therapies. The challenge moving forward will be to enrich our ability to select patients
who continue to be at the highest risk of HCC for con2880

tinued follow-up, screening, and treatment to maximize
their prognosis. Prospective trials will be needed to
address questions of the durability of SVR after DAA
treatment, the incidence of HCC after the achievement
of DAA-mediated SVR, and the benefit of continued
screening for SVR patients.
