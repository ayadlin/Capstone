Abstract
The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is characterized
by the overexpression of a few transport proteins at the plasma
membrane level, one of which is the breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP). These proteins are expressed in excretory organs, in the placenta and blood-brain barrier, and are involved
in the transport of drugs and endogenous compounds. Because
some of these proteins are expressed in the mitochondria, this
study was designed to determine whether BCRP is expressed at
a mitochondrial level and to investigate its function in various
MDR and parental drug–sensitive cell lines. By using Western
blot analysis, immunofluorescence confocal and electron
microscopy, flow cytometry analysis, and the BCRP (ABCG-2)
small interfering RNA, these experiments showed that BCRP
is expressed in the mitochondrial cristae, in which it is
functionally active. Mitoxantrone accumulation was significantly reduced in mitochondria and in cells that overexpress
BCRP, in comparison to parental drug–sensitive cells. The specific inhibitor of BCRP, fumitremorgin c, increased the accumulation of mitoxantrone significantly in comparison with
basal conditions in both whole cells and in mitochondria of
BCRP-overexpressing cell lines. In conclusion, this study shows
that BCRP is overexpressed and functionally active in the
mitochondria of MDR-positive cancer cell lines. However,
its presence in the mitochondria of parental drug–sensitive
cells suggests that BCRP can be involved in the physiology of
cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7235–42]

Introduction
Multidrug resistance (MDR) in human cancer is the major obstacle to the successful treatment of cancer by chemotherapy. The
MDR phenotype is characterized by the overexpression of the socalled ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (1). It is known that
the MDR phenotype may be due to the overexpression of ABC
transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MDR-associated protein
1 (MRP1), and/or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; refs. 2, 3).
BCRP is a protein involved in the transport of several cytotoxic drugs
and some endogenous substrates and fluorescent dyes (4–10). BCRP
has been detected in many types of solid and hematologic tumors
and a potential link between its expression and clinical drug resistance has been proposed in several recent clinical studies (10–13).
However, BCRP, like P-gp, is also expressed in many normal tissues

and could play an important role in the absorption, distribution, and
elimination of drugs (14–19).
MDR transporters are mainly expressed at cell plasma membrane level to mediate drug transport reducing the intracellular
accumulation of toxins and drugs (20). Nevertheless it was shown
that these proteins could be expressed in subcellular compartments in which they actively sequester drugs away from their
cellular targets (21–26). On the basis of these observations, we
hypothesized that BCRP could be expressed in the mitochondria in
which it could be involved in maintaining low concentrations of
anticancer drugs. The aim of this study was to elucidate the protein
expression, localization, and efflux function of BCRP in the mitochondria of different MDR cell lines and their parental drug–
sensitive clones, by using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy,
flow cytometry analysis, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and
BCRP (ABCG2) small interfering RNA (siRNA). The efflux activity
of BCRP in the model we used was measured by using two fluorescent BCRP substrates (mitoxantrone and rhodamine 123) and a
specific inhibitor for BCRP ( fumitremorgin C, FTC; ref. 27).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Experiments were done using the following cell lines: MDRpositive P1(0.5) and drug-sensitive P5 HCC cell line, two cellular clones of a
human HCC cell line (PLC/PRF/5; ref. 28); the human IGROV1 ovarian
carcinoma cell line and their derivate topotecan-selected subline, T8; the
Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCKII) and the MDCKII transduced
with human BCRP. P1(0.5) cells, grown in 0.5 Ag/mL of doxorubicin, exhibit
an MDR phenotype and are 100 times more resistant to doxorubicin than P5
(29). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Celbio) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 10 Ag/mL of streptomycin
(Celbio) at 37jC in 5% CO2. The human IGROV1 ovarian carcinoma cell line,
their derivate topotecan-selected subline, T8, the MDCKII and the MDCKII
transduced with human BCRP were kindly donated by Dr. J.H.M. Schellens
(The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands).
The TPT-resistant T8 cells were developed from the IGROV1 human
ovarian carcinoma cell line, as explained elsewhere (30, 31). These cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mmol/L of HEPES, 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin (Celbio) at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Western blot analysis. Preparation of total protein lysates and Western
blot analysis were performed as previously described (32). Monoclonal antiBCRP (BXP-21) was purchased from Chemicon International. Rat monoclonal anti-BCRP (BXP-53) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Polyclonal anti-integrin h1 was kindly donated by Dr. E. Rovida and
polyclonal anti-AIF was from Dr. A. Chiarugi (University of Florence,
Florence, Italy).
Preparation of mitochondrial fractions. Two methodologies were
used to prepare and purify mitochondria. In the first (standard method;
ref. 33) cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected, and the pellet
was suspended in 500 AL of ice-cold buffer A [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 Ag/mL

each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A] containing 250 mmol/L of
sucrose. Afterwards, cell suspension was passed five times through a 26gauge needle fitted to a syringe to lyse the cells. Unbroken cells, large plasma
membrane pieces, and nuclei were removed by centrifuging the homogenates
at 1,000 g at 4jC for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to
10,000  g centrifugation at 4jC for 20 min. The pellet fraction (i.e., mitochondria) was first washed with the above buffer A containing sucrose and
then solubilized in 50 AL of TNC buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-acetate (pH 8.0), 0.5%
Igepal CA-630, and 5 mmol/L CaCl2]. HSP-60 and cytochrome c proteins were
used as markers for the purity of mitochondrial preparations. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000  g (4jC, 1 h) to generate cytosol, that
was used to detect BCRP also in this fraction (33).
By using another methodology, as recently proposed (34), cells were
washed (thrice in PBS), resuspended in homogenization buffer [150 mmol/L
MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.7), protease inhibitors; 1 mL/1 
107 cells], incubated on ice (15 min), and Dounce homogenized (35 strokes).
Homogenization buffer with sucrose (34.2%, 1/3 vol.) was added and
centrifuged (‘‘low’’ speed, 1,000 g, 5 min, 4jC) to remove nuclei and unlysed
cells. The supernatant was centrifuged (‘‘medium’’ speed, 5,000 g, 10 min,
4jC), the pellet (‘‘crude mitochondria’’) was resuspended in homogenization
buffer + sucrose (20 mL), and centrifuged (5,000 g, 10 min, 4jC). The
resultant pellet was resuspended in solution A [3 mL; 20 mmol/L HEPES,
1 mmol/L EDTA, and 250 mmol/L sucrose (pH 7.4)]. Iodixanol solution [50%
iodixanol, 120 mmol/L HEPES, 6 mmol/L EDTA, and 250 mmol/L sucrose
(pH 7.4)] was added ( final concentration of 36%), placed in a centrifuge tube,
overlaid with solution B [10 mL, 30% iodixanol, 80 mmol/L HEPES, 4 mmol/L
EDTA, and 250 mmol/L sucrose (pH 7.4)], then solution C [to top, 10% iodixanol, 80 mmol/L HEPES, 4 mmol/L EDTA, and 250 mmol/L sucrose
(pH 7.4)], and centrifuged (50,000 g, 4 h, 4jC, swinging bucket rotor).
Protein was collected at the 30%/10% iodixanol interface, an equal volume
of solution A (10 mL) was added, followed by centrifugation (30,000 g,
10 min, 4jC). The resulting pellet was resuspended in mitochondrial
suspension buffer [250 mmol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.0) with
protease inhibitors; ref. (34)].
Confocal immunofluorescence. Living cells grown on glass coverslips
were incubated for 30 min at 37jC with 100 nmol/L of MitoTracker red
CMXRos (Molecular Probes), a cell-permeable mitochondria-selective dye,
fixed in 0.5% buffered paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature
and then processed by confocal immunofluorescence to reveal BCRP protein. After permeabilization with cold acetone for 3 min, washed cells were
incubated in blocking solution [0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and
3% glycerol in PBS] for 30 min and then with mouse monoclonal antiBCRP (BXP-21) antibody (1:50; Chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature.
The immunoreactions were revealed by incubation of the cells with goat
anti-mouse Alexa 488–conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The
MDCKII and MDCK-BCRP cells were also treated with rat monoclonal
anti-BCRP (BXP-53) antibody (1:10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In this case,
the immunoreactions were revealed by incubation of the cells with goat
anti-rat IgG-FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Negative controls were
carried out by replacing the primary antibodies with nonimmune rabbit
serum and the cross-reactivity of the secondary antibodies was tested in
control experiments in which primary antibodies were omitted. Finally, the
coverslips containing the immunolabeled cells were mounted with an
antifade mounting medium (Biomeda gel mount, Electron Microscopy
Sciences) and observed under a confocal Leica TCS SP5 microscope (Leica
Microsystems) equipped with a HeNe/Ar laser source for fluorescence
measurements, according to methods explained in detail elsewhere (32).
The observations were performed using a Leica Plan Apo 63/1.43NA oil
immersion objective. A series of optical sections (1024  1024 pixels each;
pixel size 204.3 nm) 0.4 Am in thickness were taken through the depth of the
cells at intervals of 0.4 Am. Images were then projected onto a single
‘‘extended focus’’ image.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

Qualitative assessment of colocalization between BCRP and MitoTracker fluorescence signals was performed by Image J colocalization
Plugin Software (NIH) and the quantitative assessment was done by
calculating the overlap coefficient (ranging from 0, minimum colocalization degree, to 1, maximum colocalization degree) using JACoP
Plugin Image J (35). At least 50 different cells were analyzed in each
experiment (n = 3). Calculations were made with GraphPad Prism
statistical program.
Immunoelectron microscopy. Cells were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for
10 min and the pellets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812. Ultra-thin sections collected on
nickel grids were etched with 30% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min, incubated
with normal goat serum (1:25; Sigma) to quench nonspecific binding sites
and treated with monoclonal antibody against BCRP protein (1:25) overnight at 4jC. After washing in TBS (pH 8.2), the ultra-thin sections were
subsequently incubated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 10-nm
colloidal gold particles [1:25 in TBS (pH 8.2); BBInternational]. Negative
controls were carried out. Ultra-thin sections counterstained with uranyl
acetate, were analyzed using a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope
(Jeol) at 80 kV.
Cellular uptake experiments. Experiments of uptake of fluorescent
dyes were performed by using a previously reported method (27).
Briefly, the cell culture medium was removed and each well was
washed twice with PBS. Because it was shown that BCRP-mediated
transport of rhodamine 123 (Rho 123; Sigma) depends on acquired
mutations in the BCRP gene that result in changes in amino acid 482 that
alter the substrate specificity of the protein (36–38), whereas mitoxantrone (MXR; Sigma) is the BCRP substrate transported in all cell lines,
cellular uptake experiments were performed by using both substrates.
However, because MXR is also a substrate for P-gp and MRP1, to study
the specific BCRP-mediated MXR transport, we used a BCRP-specific
modulator such as FTC (39).
The fluorescent substrates MXR or Rho 123 were added at a final
concentration of 20 Amol/L and 5 Ag/mL, respectively; FTC was added at a
final concentration of 10 Amol/L. MXR or Rho 123–related fluorescence in
the cells was detected by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 633 nm red diode laser and 660/20 nm
band-pass filter for MXR and FACSCan equipped with a 488 nm argon laser
and a 530 nm band-pass filter to detect Rho 123. The mean channel number
for each histogram (mean fluorescence intensity) was used as the measure
of fluorescence for the calculation of uptake values.
Efflux assays for mitochondrial BCRP by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial fractions, prepared as previously described, were suspended in buffer A
solution and kept on ice until the experiment was performed. Usually, all
imaging experiments were performed at room temperature in buffer A
solution. Whole isolated mitochondria from MDCKII parental, MDCKBCRP, IGROV1, and T8 cell lines were divided in test tubes to evaluate
mitochondrial autofluorescence first as well as the efflux of MXR in the
presence or absence of 10 Amol/L of FTC. Afterwards, 20 Amol/L of MXR
and 10 Amol/L of FTC were added to the samples, which were further
incubated for 4 min at room temperature, avoiding light exposure. After
incubation, to estimate MXR efflux, mitochondria exposed to MXR were
resuspended in 2 mL of ice-cold buffer A and centrifuged for 5 min at 450  g
at 4jC. Afterwards, they were washed once more with 2 mL of ice-cold buffer
A, before diluting them in 500 AL of ice-cold buffer A with or without FTC.
Samples were incubated for another 6 min at room temperature to allow MXR
efflux from mitochondria. After incubation, the fluorescence of MXR was
determined in each sample with a FACSCanto flow cytometer and measured
at a flow rate of 2,000 events/s. At least three independent experiments were
carried out for each assay.
siRNA transfection. Positive control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA, siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA, and a pool of four
different double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides directed against BCRP
(siGENOME SMARTpool, human ABCG2) were purchased from Dharmacon.
The IGROV1 and T8 cells were seeded in 60 mm dishes to reach 30% to
50% confluency after 24 h of incubation, and transfected with a total of
100 nmol/L of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies)

BCRP and MDR Phenotype
in antibiotic-free medium, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Seventy-two hours after transfection, mitochondrial fractions
and total proteins were extracted for functional assay with MXR and
Western blot analysis.

Results
Western blot analysis of BCRP in total cell lysates and in
mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions of different cell lines.
The expression of BCRP protein was analyzed by immunoblot, using
BXP-21 as the primary antibody (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis clearly
shows that the expression of BCRP is higher in T8 and in MDCKBCRP cells than in parental IGROV1 and MDCKII cells. BCRP is also
weakly expressed in P5 and P1(0.5) human HCC cell lines (Fig. 1A).
To study the localization of BCRP, mitochondrial, and cytosolic
fractions were isolated from P5, P1(0.5), IGROV1, T8, MDCKII, and
MDCK-BCRP cells, and these fractions were used to determine
BCRP, cytochrome c, and HSP-60 protein expression by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 1B, i and ii). Cytochrome c and HSP-60 were used
as markers for the purity of mitochondrial preparations. Results
clearly show that BCRP is expressed in the mitochondrial fraction
of all cell lines we studied (Fig. 1B, i and ii). BCRP expression in
mitochondria is higher in T8 and in MDCK-BCRP cells in comparison to parental drug–sensitive clones. HSP-60 was more expressed in the mitochondrial than in the cytosolic fraction of
all cell lines studied. HeLa whole cell lysate was the positive
control for HSP-60 detection. The integrity of mitochondria
during the process of purification was tested by measuring the
expression of cytochrome c both in the mitochondrial as well
as in the cytosolic fraction. Western blot analysis showed that
cytochrome c was only expressed in the mitochondrial fraction of
all cells we studied, confirming that during the process of
purification of mitochondria no leaking of cytochrome c into the
cytosol occurred (Fig. 1B, i and ii). To support our findings, mitochondria were also purified by using the fractionation methodology
based on iodixanol as recently proposed (34). As shown in Fig. 1C, i,
Western blot analysis shows that BCRP protein is expressed in the
mitochondria of MDCK-BCRP cells. It also shows that there was no
expression of integrin h1 in mitochondrial fractions of MDCKBCRP cells, whereas AIF, a marker of mitochondrial enzymes, was
highly expressed, confirming the quality of mitochondrial
separation (Fig. 1C, ii and iii).
Mitochondrial localization of BCRP in different cell lines by
confocal and electron microscopy. Both confocal immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the results
obtained by Western blot analysis, showing the presence of BCRP in
mitochondria of intact P5, P1(0.5), IGROV1, T8, MDCKII, and MDCKBCRP cells (Figs. 2 and 3). In particular, confocal microscopy shows
the expression of BCRP in the mitochondria of intact cells, using either
the BXP-21 or the BXP-53 antibodies (Fig. 2A, B, C, and D, respectively).
By using two different specific antibodies, we ruled out the
possibility of a cross-reaction with one of the other proteins. BCRP
was also abundantly expressed at the plasma membrane level, as
shown in Fig. 2.
These results were confirmed by the immunoelectron microscopy studies. As shown in Fig. 3, BCRP immunogold labeling of
Epon 812-embedded MDCK-BCRP cells with anti-BCRP antibodies
showed that both plasma membrane (Fig. 3B) and mitochondria
(cristae; Fig. 3C) were decorated with gold particles (arrows).

there was no effect with 10 Amol/L of FTC (data not shown).
Experiments done by using MXR showed that cell accumulation of the drug was significantly increased in parental drug–
sensitive MDCKII and in IGROV1 cells compared with cell
autofluorescence, and no effect of the BCRP inhibitor, FTC
(10 Amol/L), was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 4). On the
contrary, MXR accumulation was significantly reduced in

MDCK-BCRP and in T8 cells that overexpress BCRP as
compared with parental drug–sensitive cell lines. The reduced
accumulation of MXR was probably due to BCRP-mediated
efflux in these cells as 10 Amol/L of FTC significantly
increased cell fluorescence, compared with basal conditions,
in the transfected MDCK-BCRP and in T8 cells.

mitochondria, efflux experiments were performed in isolated
mitochondria of MDCKII, MDCK-BCRP, IGROV1, and T8 cells
using only MXR.
As shown in Fig. 5, a high level of fluorescence due to MXR was
detected in the presence of 10 Amol/L of FTC in the mitochondria
of MDCK-BCRP and T8. This level of fluorescence was more than
2-fold higher as compared with mitochondria of the FTC untreated cells. Mitochondria of parental drug–sensitive MDCKII
and IGROV1 cells showed less efflux of fluorescence compared
with BCRP-overexpressing cell lines.
Effect of ABCG-2 siRNA transfection on BCRP-mediated
transport. Efflux experiments were also performed, by using
flow cytometry, in isolated mitochondria from IGROV1 and T8
cells which were previously transfected with ABCG-2 siRNA.
As shown in Fig. 6A, fluorescence due to MXR accumulation was
higher in the mitochondria of T8 cells transfected with ABCG-2
siRNA than in the mitochondria of the untreated cells. On the other
hand, in the mitochondria of parental IGROV1 cells transfected
with ABCG-2 siRNA, which showed low levels of BCRP, the MXR
efflux was much less than that observed in BCRP-overexpressing
cell lines.
Western blot analysis, performed to estimate the expression of
BCRP both in whole cell lysates and in isolated mitochondria from
IGROV1 and T8 cells which were previously transfected with ABCG-2
siRNA showed that the expression of BCRP was reduced by ABCG-2–

www.aacrjournals.org

targeted siRNA both in whole cell lysates and in the mitochondria of
T8-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). The expression of BCRP was also reduced by ABCG-2–targeted siRNA in the whole cell lysate of IGROV1,
whereas no effect was found in the mitochondria of parental drug–
sensitive cells (data not shown). The inhibition of BCRP expression
was not observed using the nonspecific control siRNA.

Discussion
Because the overexpression of ABC transporters in tumors plays
an important role in resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, a better
understanding of molecular mechanisms of MDR phenotype occurrence could be useful to bypass drug resistance (2, 40). It is known that
cancer cells which express the MDR phenotype are characterized by
several biological changes that make cells more resistant to various
mechanisms of cell damage (41–43). Recently, it was proposed that
P-gp could be expressed in the mitochondrial membrane of MDRpositive cells, but this observation is still controversial (32, 34, 44).
We studied the localization and activity of BCRP in the mitochondria of different MDR and their parental drug–sensitive cell
lines. Using Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy, we
show that BCRP is highly expressed in T8 and MDCK-BCRP, and
weakly in P5, P1(0.5), IGROV1, and MDCK-II cells, both in whole cell
lysates and in mitochondria. In addition, because the mitochondrial
fractions obtained by using the standard methodology (33) for

separation of these organelles from the other cell parts could be
contaminated by plasma and other cell membranes, as recently
suggested, mitochondria were purified using the iodixanol-based
separation methodology (34). Also by using this method, the
expression of BCRP in the mitochondria of drug-resistant MDCKBCRP cells was confirmed. By using two specific antibodies against
different epitopes of BCRP, confocal microscopy immunofluorescence showed that BCRP is expressed in the mitochondria of
parental and drug-resistant MDCK-BCRP intact cells.
Accordingly, the presence of BCRP at a mitochondrial level was also
shown by using immunoelectron microscopy that showed the expression of BCRP in the mitochondrial cristae (inner membrane; Fig. 3).
Uptake and efflux experiments using MXR and Rho 123 as fluorescent probes, in the presence or absence of FTC, a specific and potent
inhibitor of BCRP activity, show that FTC inhibits BCRP-mediated
transport of MXR either from the cell or from the mitochondria. The
molecular mechanisms by which FTC inhibits BCRP are unknown,
but possibly work through direct inhibition of ATPase activity (45).
To confirm the results obtained by exploiting the inhibitory
effect of FTC, we studied the activity of BCRP in isolated mitochondria from IGROV1 and T8 cells, previously transfected with
ABCG-2 siRNA. Altogether, our findings suggest that BCRP activity
is responsible for MXR efflux in cells overexpressing BCRP.
The observation that BCRP is expressed in cells in which P-gp is
not expressed, such as MDCKII cells, suggests that the two proteins

have different mechanisms to regulate their expression. BCRP, like
P-gp, is quite an unspecific ABC transporter, although its expression
both at the plasma membrane level and in several cell organelles
suggests roles for this protein that have not yet been clarified (46). The
notion that BCRP protects cells from hypoxia-related cell damage (47),
together with the demonstration in the present work of its expression
on the inner membrane (cristae) of the mitochondrion, suggest that
BCRP could be involved in maintaining the electrochemical gradient
between matrix and intermembrane space of mitochondria but
more studies are necessary to elucidate this hypothesis.
Cells expressing the MDR phenotype are usually more resistant
to several agents that trigger apoptosis compared with parental drug–
sensitive cells. Recently, it was shown that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase
are involved in the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic
mediated-apoptosis pathway in HCC cells (48). We have recently shown
that apoptosis can be restored by low concentrations of celecoxib in
a P-gp–dependent mechanism in MDR-positive cell lines (49). Celecoxib exerts a direct effect on the expression of P-gp and therefore on
apoptotic pathways, however, it is unknown whether this drug and
other coxibs could exert some effect on BCRP expression and/or activity.
To conclude, in the present study, we bring evidence that BCRP
is functionally expressed in the mitochondria of MDR cell lines. The
most probable hypothesis is that BCRP could be involved in
protecting mitochondrial DNA from damage due to anticancer
drugs in MDR-positive cells. However, its expression, although to a
