FoxM1 Mediates Resistance to Herceptin and Paclitaxel
Janai R. Carr, Hyun Jung Park, Zebin Wang, Megan M. Kiefer, and Pradip Raychaudhuri

Abstract
Inherent and acquired therapeutic resistance in breast cancer remains a major clinical challenge. In human
breast cancer samples, overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 has been suggested to be a
marker of poor prognosis. In this study, we report that FoxM1 overexpression confers resistance to the human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 monoclonal antibody Herceptin and microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel, both as single agents and in combination. FoxM1 altered microtubule dynamics to protect tumor cells
from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the tubulin-destabilizing protein
Stathmin, whose expression also confers resistance to paclitaxel, is a direct transcriptional target of FoxM1.
Significantly, attenuating FoxM1 expression by small interfering RNA or an alternate reading frame (ARF)–
derived peptide inhibitor increased therapeutic sensitivity. Our findings indicate that targeting FoxM1 could
relieve therapeutic resistance in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(12); 5054–63. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The proliferation-specific oncogenic transcription factor
FoxM1 is overexpressed in a broad range of tumor types examined, including those of mammary, neural, gastrointestinal, and reproductive origin (1–4). This expression pattern
is attributed to the ability of FoxM1 to transactivate genes
required for cell cycle progression (5, 6). In dividing cells,
FoxM1 begins to accumulate during S phase, peaks at the
G2-M transition, and is degraded by APC/C-Cdh1 immediately following M phase (7, 8). Ablation of FoxM1 leads to
a failure to enter S phase and improper M-phase completion,
resulting in mitotic catastrophe (8–12). FoxM1 promotes the
G1-S transition by downregulation of the cyclin-dependent
kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 through multiple mechanisms.
Specifically, FoxM1 can increase the proteolytic degradation
of p27 through upregulation of Skp2 and Cks1, members of
the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for the degradation of p27 (12). In addition, by upregulation of KIS kinase,
FoxM1 promotes the localization of p27 to the cytoplasm
(13). During G2-M, FoxM1 increases levels of various factors
such as Aurora B Kinase, Survivin, and Cdc25B to allow successful entry and completion of mitosis (5, 12).
FoxM1 is regulated throughout the cell cycle by phosphorylation. Growth factors activate surface receptors to initiate
signaling pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase
that promote cell division (14). The result of these signaling

cascades is the activation of kinases such as Cyclin-Cdk and
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), all of which results in the phosphorylation and activation of FoxM1 (15–17). Recently, it
has been shown that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ErbB2, a surface receptor, functions upstream
of FoxM1. Overexpression or silencing of HER2 correlated directly with FoxM1 levels in mammary cell lines and in transgenic mouse models (18). In a study of human mammary
tumors, FoxM1 expression was 8.7-fold higher in tumor cells
versus normal tissue controls and showed increased nuclear
staining. In addition, it was shown that FoxM1 expression
correlated with that of HER2 and functioned as a predictor
of poor patient outcome (1).
HER2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
family of receptors. HER2 has no known ligand, but functions
by forming heterodimers with other family members to promote intracellular signaling (14). Amplification of HER2 is a
sign of a highly aggressive tumor type with few treatment options. Several therapies aimed at inhibiting HER2 signaling
are in use, including the monoclonal antibody Herceptin
(trastuzumab) that functions to disrupt the interaction between HER2 and its preferred binding partner HER3 (19).
Treatment with Herceptin results in the accumulation of
the Cdk inhibitor p27 and subsequent G1-S cell cycle arrest.
Unfortunately, the efficacy of Herceptin as a monotherapy is
thought to be <30% and in combination with microtubule
stabilizing drugs ∼60% (20). Resistance to Herceptin develops quickly and is thought to stem from compensated signaling by other EGF family members or dysregulation of
downstream pathways such as PI3K/Akt (21–23).
Herceptin is commonly used in conjunction with other
therapies, including paclitaxel. The primary mechanism of
action of paclitaxel is to bind β-tubulin and prevent dissociation of α/β tubulin dimers, resulting in mitotic failure
and consequent apoptosis (24). Paclitaxel is used in the
treatment of multiple tumor types and has shown particular success in treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Yet,

FoxM1 Mediates Resistance to Herceptin and Paclitxel

resistance does occur. Insensitivity to paclitaxel has been
shown in cells that overexpress HER2. On average, cells
with HER2 amplification require a 100-fold higher dose of
paclitaxel to produce the same effect (25). Resistance to
paclitaxel has been attributed to additional mechanisms including increased expression of multidrug resistant 1
(MDR1), a protein that can pump toxins out of cells. Other
commonly documented mechanisms of resistance include
changes in microtubule stability or mutations in the tubulin
proteins (26). In studies of human samples, Stathmin, a regulator of microtuble dynamics, has been shown to promote
paclitaxel resistance (27).
We investigated the possibility that the high levels of
FoxM1 in HER2-amplified mammary tumors could confer
resistance to treatments and whether targeting FoxM1 could
sensitize tumor cells to therapy. We found that FoxM1
mediates both inherent and acquired resistance to the
HER2 targeting monoclonal antibody Herceptin. Additionally, we identified a novel function of FoxM1, to alter microtubule dynamics through the regulation of Stathmin, which
renders cells resistant to paclitaxel treatment. Moreover,
we show that inhibition of FoxM1 by an alternate reading
frame (ARF)–derived peptide sensitizes cells to Hercepin
and paclitaxel therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemotherapeutic agents
SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and BT474 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum
and penicillin/streptomycin. Stable cell lines were generated by transfection of pBabe or pBabe-FoxM1 retroviral
constructs followed by selection in puromycin. Control
small interfering RNA (siRNA) as well as siRNA specific to
FoxM1 (Dharmacon) were transfected using Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen). Mutant and ARF peptide have been previously
described (28). Paclitaxel (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO.
Herceptin, a gift from Genentech, was dissolved in sterile
water.
Flow cytometry, proliferation measurements, and
colony-forming assay
For cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and then resuspended in propidium iodide
solution (50 μg/mL propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/mL RNaseA,
and 0.05% Triton-X). All reagents were purchased from Sigma. After 40 minutes of incubation at 37°C cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer. 5-Bromo-2-Deoxyuridine
(BrDUrd; 10 μmol/L) from Sigma was added to culture media. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody
(1:250, DAKO) followed by anti-mouse FITC (DAKO) and 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes). Cell
viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
assay (Promega), which measures the amount of oxygenated
oxyluciferin that has a direct correlation to ATP present. For
colony-forming assay, 3 to 5 × 103 cells were plated in triplicate in a 24-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, treatment was

initiated. After 14 to 17 days, cells were fixed and stained with
crystal violet. Quantification was done using Adobe Photoshop, a method described elsewhere (29). All P values were
calculated using the Student's t test.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR
RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), and cDNA
was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad).
Equal amounts of cDNA were used for all PCRs (Promega).
PCR products were analyzed over a series of cycle numbers to ensure that data were produced during the PCR logscale amplification. Samples were run on agarose gels,
photographed, and quantified using Image J. The primers
used were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-ACA CCC ACT CCT CCA CCT TT-3′ and

Western blot
Extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing
1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), and 0.5% Triton-X. Phosphate inhibitor cocktail
set II (Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor (Roche) were
added before each experiment. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against FoxM1 has been previously described (17).
Anti-kip1/p27 (1:10,000, BD Biosciences), Stathmin
(1:1,000, Cell Signaling), and Cdk2 (1:200, Santa Cruz) were
also used. For tubulin fractionation, α-tubulin antibody
(1:10,000, Sigma) and β-tubulin (1:10,000, NeoMarkers)
were used for analysis. Quantification was performed using
the Image J software (NIH).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as
previously described (30). Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes to allow cross-linking and then were
quenched with 125 nmol/L glycine. Cells were collected and
lysed in SDS lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), protease, and phosphate inhibitors].
Lysate was sonicated, precleared, and incubated with FoxM1
antibody followed by collection with Protein-A and ProteinG-Sepharose beads with salmon sperm (Upstate). Beads were
washed and DNA was extracted using a PCR purification kit
(Qiagen). The following primers were used for PCR: 5′-CAA
ATG TGC TTG CCT TTT AGC C-3′ and 5′-TGG GAT TAC
AGA TGT GAG CCA CC-3′ for –5397, and 5′-CAC GGT
CAG ACC AAT TTC T-3′ and 5′-TGA TAG GGG AGG AAG
AGC AA-3′ as a nonspecific control.

Tubulin assay
Separation of polymerized and soluble fractions was done
in accordance with previously published assays (31). Cells
were seeded at 80% confluency in 24-well plates. The following day, they were treated with 0 or 1 nmol/L paclitaxel for
24 hours. Cells were collected in hypotonic buffer [1 mmol/L
MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)] and centrifuged for 10 minutes at room
temperature (14,000 rpm). The supernatant was used as the
soluble fraction, whereas the pellet made up the polymerized
fraction. Samples were analyzed by Western blot.

Results
FoxM1 overexpression confers Herceptin resistance
To investigate the hypothesis that increased FoxM1 is sufficient to induce resistance to Herceptin, we stably introduced
FoxM1 expression cDNA in SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-453.
All cell lines have HER2 amplification and BT474 is estrogen
receptor positive. Drug sensitivity was tested by colony formation assay. Cells were plated at low density and treated continuously with 10 μg/mL of Herceptin for 14 days. As shown by
the quantification of the colony formation assay, FoxM1

FoxM1 Mediates Resistance to Herceptin and Paclitxel

Figure 2. SKBR3-FoxM1 cell lines fail
to accumulate p27 after treatment with
Herceptin. A, SKBR3-pBabe and
FoxM1-expressing cell lines were
treated with increasing doses of
Herceptin for 48 h. Representative
Western blots of FoxM1 and p27
levels are shown. Cdk2 was used as a
loading control. B, SKBR3 stable
cell lines were treated with 10 μg/mL of
Herceptin for 24, 48, and 72 h. FoxM1
and p27 levels are shown by Western
blot. C, SKBR3-pBabe cell lines were
treated with 10 μg/mL of IgG for indicated periods of time. FoxM1 and p27
were assayed by
Western blot and Cdk2 was used as
a loading control.

overexpression resulted in a 3- to 7-fold increase in colony
number compared with pBabe-expressing cells (Fig. 1A), providing evidence that FoxM1 confers resistance to Herceptin.
The magnitude of the G1-S arrest induced by Herceptin
was measured by propidium iodide staining followed by flow
cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS) analysis. Cells were treated in 10 μg/mL of Herceptin for 72 hours,
and cell cycle profiles were examined. The control pBabe
lines showed a statistically significant increase in the number
of cells in G1, but the FoxM1-expressing cells did not exhibit
any significant enrichment of the G1 population (Fig. 1B).
Herceptin alone does not induce apoptosis (21). Consistent
with that, none of the cell lines showed an increase in the
sub-G 1 population. To further investigate resistance in
FoxM1-expressing cells, we measured the ability to incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 1C). Upon treatment, SKBR3-pBabe showed
a substantial (35%) reduction in the number of BrdUrdpositive cells. FoxM1-expressing cells did not show any significant decrease in BrdUrd incorporation. Taken together,
these results indicate that FoxM1 overcomes the G1-S arrest
and proliferation defect caused by Herceptin, allowing cells
to continue to grow in the presence of the drug.
FoxM1 prevents Herceptin-induced accumulation
of p27
Although multiple mechanisms of resistance exist, previous reports indicated that low levels of p27 could contribute
to Herceptin insensitivity (21). FoxM1 functions as a negative
regulator of p27 by increasing proteolysis. We hypothesized
that the resistance observed in FoxM1-overexpressing cells
could be due to a failure to accumulate p27. To test that possibility, SKBR3-pBabe or FoxM1-expressing lines were treated
with 10 μg/mL of Herceptin for 0, 24, 48, or 72 hours or with
increasing doses. Western blot of FoxM1 and p27 levels
showed that in control SKBR3 cells, the levels of FoxM1 decreased with treatment and the p27 levels accumulate as ex-

pected. Interestingly, in SKBR3-FoxM1 cell lines, the basal
expression of p27 is lower and levels remained low even after
a high-dose of Herceptin (Fig. 2A and B). These results show
that the likely mechanism by which FoxM1 confers resistance is by preventing the accumulation of p27 that is required for Herceptin-induced G1-S arrest. Treatment with
IgG did not cause changes in FoxM1 or p27; therefore, these
effects are specific to inhibition of the HER2 pathway and not
a general antibody-induced response (Fig. 2C).
Targeting FoxM1 in mammary tumor cells with
inherent Herceptin resistance increases sensitivity
To generate cell lines that have inherent resistance to Herceptin, we cultured parental SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, and BT474
lines continuously in 5 μg/mL of Herceptin. At the end of 6
months, the lines grew at the same rate in the presence or absence of Herceptin and had regained original cell morphology.
The source of resistance in these lines is not uniform as we
observed an increase in phosphorylated Akt in only SKBR3
(data not shown). FoxM1 levels in parental and resistant lines
were assayed by Western blot. Interestingly, levels of FoxM1
were higher in all resistant lines (Fig. 3A). This increase was
reflected at the RNA level. To confirm a higher activity of
FoxM1, we assayed the RNA levels of the known FoxM1 target
genes. As shown in the SKBR3-resistant line, FoxM1 RNA levels
were significantly increased (15-fold) as well as the levels of
the p27 ubiquitin ligase components Skp2 (2.5-fold) and
Cks1 (5.6-fold). Additionally, levels of the cell cycle regulators,
PLK1 (1.5-fold) and Cyclin B1 (16.6-fold) were amplified in the
resistant line compared with the parental control line (Fig. 3B).
FoxM1 levels are elevated in resistant lines and we observed that overexpression of FoxM1 could confer acquired
resistance to Herceptin. We wanted to determine whether
targeting FoxM1 could resensitize lines with inherent resistance. Knockdown of FoxM1 by siRNA in SKBR3-resistant
cells led to a >75% reduction in cell number when used in

conjunction with Herceptin. This effect was also observed in
MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that FoxM1 is upregulated in resistant lines and that targeting FoxM1 provides a method of sensitizing resistant cells
to Herceptin treatment.
FoxM1 induces expression of Stathmin to confer
resistance to paclitaxel
It has been previously reported that cells that overexpress
HER2 display decreased sensitivity to apoptosis caused by
paclitaxel (25, 32). Although microtubule-stabilizing agents
such as paclitaxel induce mitotic arrest and consequent
apoptosis, some patients fail to respond to this drug. We were
curious to determine whether FoxM1, which is downstream
of HER2, could protect from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
We noted that after 7 days of treatment in a low dose
of paclitaxel (0.1 μmol/L), only 25% of SKBR3-pBabe cells
survived, whereas ∼50% of SKBR3-FoxM1 cells were still
viable (Fig. 4A). This effect was also observed in MDAMB-453 and BT474 FoxM1–expressing lines (Fig. 5C).
Moreover, knockdown of FoxM1 by siRNA in SKBR3 cells
was able to sensitize to Taxol as evidenced by a comparison of IC 50 values between siRNA control and siRNA
FoxM1–treated cells, 0.06 μmol/L versus 0.01 μmol/L

(Fig. 4A). These data indicate that FoxM1 can protect cells
from paclitaxel-induced cell death.
Several mechanisms to combat Taxol-induced apoptosis
have been reported, namely, upregulation of multidrug resistant 1, a P-glycoprotein family member that can shuttle
toxins out of cells; upregulation of the IAP (inhibitor of
apoptosis) family members including Survivin; and altered
microtuble dynamics (26). We sought to investigate the
mechanism by which FoxM1 could prevent paclitaxelinduced apoptosis. We did not detect any effect of FoxM1
on the levels of multidrug resistant 1 (data not shown).
FoxM1 is known to positively regulate the CIAP family
member Survivin, and increased expression is known to
protect cells from paclitaxel. However, in the mammary tumor cells, we did not observe increased expression of Survivin (data not shown). We went on to examine the
possibility of altered microtubule dynamics induced by
FoxM1. As paclitaxel is known to stabilize tubulin, we
compared the ratio of polymerized to soluble microtubule
fractions. We fractionated cell lysates to obtain polymerized and soluble tubulin fractions in SKBR3-pBabe and
SKBR3-FoxM1-expressing lines that were left nontreated
or treated with paclitaxel. Without treatment, cells show
similar tubulin ratios and nearly all detectable tubulins

FoxM1 Mediates Resistance to Herceptin and Paclitxel

Figure 4. FoxM1 expression induces resistance to paclitaxel alone by increasing Stathmin expression and activity. A, top, SKBR3-pBabe and
FoxM1-expressing lines were treated continuously with 0.1 μmol/L of paclitaxel for 7 d, and viable cell numbers were determined by luminescent
measurement of ATP. Bottom, SKBR3 parental cells were treated with control siRNA or siRNA specific to FoxM1 for 72 h then treated with indicated doses
of paclitaxel for 24 h. CellTiter Glo (Promega), a luminescence assay, was used to measure cell viability. B, polymerized and soluble tubulin fractions from
nontreated and treated SKBR3-pBabe and FoxM1 cell lines was generated by centrifugation. Western blot was used to assay α-tubulin and β-tubulin ratios
in polymerized and soluble fractions. Relative percentages are shown above the Western blot. C, RNA from SKBR3 pBabe and FoxM1 lines was
collected, and RT-PCR was used to measure stathmin. Values were normalized against cyclophilin. Inset, relative protein expression by Western blot.
D, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed in SKBR3 cells using an antibody specific to FoxM1 or IgG as a control. PCR was used to

were in the soluble form. Upon treatment with paclitaxel,
SKBR3-pBabe cells show a dramatic shift toward the polymerized fraction. The FoxM1-expressing cells did show a
shift toward the polymerized fraction but the ratio was
considerably lower (0.56:1 FoxM1 versus 3.76:1 pBabe;
Fig. 4B).
It has been previously established that increased expression and activity of the microtubule-destabilizing protein
Stathmin can confer resistance to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis both in patient and cell culture samples (27, 33).
The hallmark of increased activity is a low ratio of polymerized to soluble tubulin as we observed in FoxM1expressing cells (31). Therefore, we compared Stathmin

www.aacrjournals.org

RNA expression in pBabe and FoxM1-expressing cell lines,
and observed that FoxM1 cells express 2-fold more Stathmin compared with the pBabe control cells. This difference
was also noted at the protein level (Fig. 4C). In addition,
chromatin immunoprecipitation using SKBR3 cells with
FoxM1 antibody showed enrichment of the Stathmin promoter region, indicating that the RNA and subsequent protein increase in FoxM1-expressing lines is likely due to a
direct interaction of FoxM1 with the Stathmin gene promoter (Fig. 4D). Together, these studies show that
SKBR3-FoxM1 cell lines are resistant to paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis by directly targeting and upregulating the microtubule-destabilizing protein Stathmin.

FoxM1 overexpression protects from Herceptin and
paclitaxel in combination
Although the success of Herceptin as a single agent is
significant, the best therapeutic response is seen when
Herceptin is used in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel. We were interested in
determining the role of FoxM1 in resistance toward combination therapy.
Pretreatment for 72 hours with Herceptin followed by
paclitaxel treatment of both SKBR3-pBabe and FoxM1 cell
lines revealed significant differences. The FoxM1-expressing
cells exhibited resistance to killing. For example, 7 days after

paclitaxel treatment, only 10% to 12% of the pBabe cells survived, whereas the survival of the FoxM1-expressing cells was
>40% (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of FoxM1 in SKBR3 sensitized
the cells to combination treatment as evidenced by IC50 calculations, 0.097 μmol/L (siRNA Control) versus 0.028 μmol/L
(siRNA FoxM1; Fig. 5B).
Long-term combination treatment was also investigated
by colony-forming assay. Quantification of colony numbers show that ∼55% of FoxM1-expressing cells survived
after combination therapy, whereas only 26% of pBabe
lines survived the treatment in SKBR3 cells (Fig. 5C).

were treated for 24 h with increasing amounts of paclitaxel, and ATP was measured by luminescence. C, 3 to 5 × 103 SKBR3, MDA-MB-453, or BT474 cells
were seeded in each well in triplicate. Cells were either left nontreated or pretreated in 10 μg/mL Herceptin for 72 h then pulsed in 0.1 μmol/L paclitaxel
for 4 h. Wells that received Herceptin were continuously cultured in 10 μg/mL for the duration of the experiment. Media were changed every 3 d. Cells
were stained after a total of 17 d in crystal violet and representative wells are shown (left). Graph shows quantification of triplicates from three separate

FoxM1 Mediates Resistance to Herceptin and Paclitxel

Figure 6. Targeting FoxM1 with ARF peptide is sufficient to overcome inherent Herceptin resistance and to sensitize pBabe or FoxM1-overexpressing cells
to treatment. A, ARF peptide or mutant peptide (2 μmol/L) was used to treat either parental or resistant SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453 cells. Cells were
pretreated with peptide for 3 d then treated with both 10 μg/mL Herceptin and peptide. Media were changed daily, and cells were stained with crystal violet
after 17 total days. Graph shows quantification of colony-forming assay by Photoshop. B, SKBR3-pBabe and FoxM1 cell lines were treated with either
mutant or ARF peptide for 3 d. Wells receiving both Herceptin and paclitaxel were pretreated for 72 h with Herceptin before receiving indicated doses of
paclitaxel. Quantification of triplicates is shown in the graph with representative images below.

therapy was observed also in a comparison of pBabe versus FoxM1-expressing MDA-MB-453 (4.5% versus 39.6%)
and BT474 (2.3% versus 31%) cell lines (Fig. 5C). These
data clearly indicate that FoxM1 can protect breast cancer cells from treatment with Herceptin and paclitaxel in
combination.

An ARF-derived peptide inhibitor of FoxM1 is sufficient
to sensitize mammary tumor cells to treatment
Studies in our laboratory have shown that FoxM1 is inhibited by a small peptide that contains an 18-AA region of
the p19ARF protein (residues between 26 and 44). This
peptide has been shown to reduce proliferation and induce

apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vivo (28).
Treatment with the ARF-derived peptide and Herceptin
led to a staggering 90% reduction in SKBR3 and MDAMB-453–resistant cell number as measured by colonyforming assay, similar to parental lines treated with both
(Fig. 6A). As expected, treatment with a mutant peptide
did not show a difference in colony number compared with
parental lines and therefore was used as a control.
We went on to test the ability of the ARF peptide to sensitize the FoxM1-expressing cells to treatment. Addition of
the ARF peptide to Herceptin, paclitaxel, or combination
treatment showed a dramatic reduction in cell number compared with mutant peptide. In pBabe-expressing lines, the
ARF peptide was able to sensitize cells to all treatments, resulting in a greater effect from the same dosage. Most notably, addition of ARF peptide had a significant effect in FoxM1
lines with <3% of cells surviving combination treatment.
These data reveal that the use of ARF peptide in chemotherapeutic regimens could have great clinical promise.

Discussion
Drug resistance, either inherent or acquired, poses significant clinical challenges. The mechanisms by which cells
acquire resistance are multiple and complex, and our understanding will be important to create better therapeutic options.
The work presented here is the first report that high levels
of FoxM1, commonly seen in tumors, offer mammary tumor
cells an additional growth advantage, protection against
Herceptin and paclitaxel both alone and in combination.
Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that
FoxM1 can regulate p27 degradation and localization to allow
cell cycle progression (5, 13). The work presented here shows
that this ability of FoxM1 to keep basal levels of p27 low and
prevent p27 accumulation in response to Herceptin treatment
is mediating a resistant phenotype in FoxM1-overexpressing
cell lines. Yet, it is likely that FoxM1 can mediate resistance by
other mechanisms. This is evident in cells harboring inherent
resistance to Herceptin. The basal levels of p27 in BT474 and
MDA-MB-453 are higher in resistant lines than in parental
(data not shown), indicating dysregulation. In a pooled resistant cell line, it is feasible that the mechanisms by which cells
evade therapy are heterogeneous; yet, the result, as we observed, is increased FoxM1 expression and activity. These
findings are significant because regardless of p27 or p-Akt status, inhibition of FoxM1 induces resensitization. These data
indicate that FoxM1 is likely a downstream mediator of resistance caused by multiple mechanisms and therefore a valuable therapeutic target.
Several studies have reported alterations in microtubules
as a source of resistance to paclitaxel, and some have implicated increased expression of Stathmin (27, 33). Yet, upstream
transcriptional regulators of Stathmin have not been reported. Not only do we show that FoxM1 directly increases
expression of stathmin, but that microtubules in FoxM1overexpressing lines fail to polymerize in response to paclitaxel treatment, an indicator that the Stathmin activity is high in
these cells. The implications of this finding spread past breast

cancer. As mentioned, FoxM1 expression is elevated in all tumor types examined to date and paclitaxel is a commonly
used chemotherapeutic agent. It is likely that FoxM1 inhibition could be a successful tool to sensitize various tumor
types to treatment. Therapeutically, paclitaxel has significant
and limiting side effects including a decrease in blood cells
(neutropenia, anemia, and leukopenia) and chemotherapyinduced neuropathy (34). The addition of a FoxM1 inhibitor
to a chemotherapeutic regimen could result in lower effective
doses and a potential reduction in side effects for patients.
In the past several years, the ability of FoxM1 to promote
tumorigenesis and tumor growth has become apparent. Consequently, several groups have been working to develop
FoxM1 inhibitors. In addition to the ARF-derived peptide inhibitor of FoxM1, it has been shown that the antibiotics siomycin A and thiostrepton could inhibit FoxM1 (28, 35).
Gefitinib, an EGF receptor inhibitor, can target FoxM1 (36).
In addition, proteasome inhibitors, several of which are in
use clinically, can downregulate FoxM1 levels (37). Several
studies have shown that FoxM1 functions to promote proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, evade senescence, and promote
angiogenesis (30, 38, 39). Our studies also implicate that
FoxM1 can promote a drug-resistant phenotype in breast tumors and could be targeted, perhaps by the ARF peptide, in
sensitization therapy. Notably, previous in vivo studies using
ARF peptide did not show toxicity in other organ systems,
one important factor in choosing therapies (28).
Interestingly, several FoxM1 target genes have been implicated in resistance including Survivin, PLK1, and Cks1. Survivin
was shown to induce resistance to paclitaxel, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, and radiation therapy (40).
Knockdown of PLK1 could sensitize cells to cisplatin, Herceptin, and paclitaxel, whereas Cks1 is implicated in paclitaxel resistance as well (41, 42). As these factors are downstream
targets of FoxM1, it is likely that therapies aimed at reducing
FoxM1 also will serve as a method of sensitizing tumor cells to
other therapies. In line with this, it was recently shown that
knockdown of FoxM1 in cells that have resistance to cisplatin
could induce apoptosis (43). The ability of FoxM1 to induce
resensitization could be applicable in a variety of tumor types
and therapies. Our study shows that FoxM1 is a valid target in
drug-resistant tumors, and inhibitors of FoxM1 should be
considered in future therapeutic trials.
