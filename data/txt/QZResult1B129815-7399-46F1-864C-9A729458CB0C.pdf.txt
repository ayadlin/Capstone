ABSTRACT
Our analysis of the tumors of 57 women with metastatic breast cancer with next
generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrates that each patient’s tumor is unique in its
molecular fingerprint. We observed 216 somatic aberrations in 70 different genes,
including 131 distinct aberrations. The most common gene alterations (in order of
decreasing frequency) included: TP53, PIK3CA, CCND1, MYC, HER2 (ERBB2), MCL1,
PTEN, FGFR1, GATA3, NF1, PIK3R1, BRCA2, EGFR, IRS2, CDH1, CDKN2A, FGF19, FGF3
and FGF4. Aberrations included mutations (46%), amplifications (45%), deletions
(5%), splices (2%), truncations (1%), fusions (0.5%) and rearrangements (0.5%),
with multiple distinct variants within the same gene. Many of these aberrations
represent druggable targets, either through direct pathway inhibition or through an
associated pathway (via ‘crosstalk’). The ‘molecular individuality’ of these tumors
suggests that a customized strategy, using an “N-of-One” model of precision medicine,
may represent an optimal approach for the treatment of patients with advanced
tumors.

Genomic profiling demonstrates a multitude of
aberrations across a broad spectrum of cancer-related
genes [1, 2] and represents a new way to classify cancer
[3]. Many studies demonstrate that matching patients to
treatment based on molecular characteristics can result
in remarkable responses, even in advanced, refractory
disease, despite heterogeneity in patients’ molecular
landscapes [3]. However, most patients have short-lived
responses.
Herein, we demonstrate that, amongst 57 patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with metastatic breast cancer, no two patients had the same
molecular portfolio. The number of distinct aberrations
driving advanced tumors may therefore be responsible
for the remarkable resistance of metastatic malignancies
to prolonged remission or cure, especially with our
current therapeutic strategies [3]. These data suggest
that traditional design paradigms governing diagnosis
and management of metastatic cancer and the clinical
research that informs them, all of which are predicated
on grouping patients in order to evaluate targeted agents,
2349

may be inadequate to address the complexity unveiled by
modern genomics.
We used next generation sequencing (NGS) of
182 to 236 genes to interrogate tumors from 57 women
with metastatic breast cancer (26 with hormone receptor
(HR)-positive and HER2-negative tumors; 7 with HRpositive/HER2-positive tumors; 4 with HR-negative/
HER2-positive tumors; and, 20 with triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) (Supplemental Table 1) [4]. Importantly,
if different variants in each gene were considered as
distinct then each patient had a unique profile of genomic
aberrations (Supplemental Table 1). Even if variants
within a gene were considered identical, there were 54
different genomic landscape patterns amongst the 57
patients (Supplemental Table 1).
The most commonly altered genes (in order of
decreasing frequency) were: TP53, PIK3CA, CCND1,
MYC, HER2 (ERBB2), MCL1, PTEN, FGFR1, GATA3,
NF1, PIK3R1, BRCA2, EGFR, IRS2, CDH1, CDKN2A,
FGF19, FGF3 and FGF4 (Supplemental Table 2).
The most frequent aberrations were mutations and
amplifications, comprising 46% and 45% of abnormalities,
respectively. The average number of molecular aberrations
per patient was 4 (average = 4 in HR-positive/HER2negative; 4 in HR-positive/HER2-positive; 3 in HR-

negative /HER2-positive; and 4 in TNBC (Figure 1).
A total of 131 distinct somatic aberrations (216
aberrations in total) were identified: 80 mutations
(including mutation variants in the same gene); 37
amplifications; five deletions; five splices; two truncations;
one fusion; and, one rearrangement. Of the 80 distinct
mutation variants we observed (Supplemental Table 3),
49 have not been previously reported for patients with
breast cancer in COSMIC, The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) [1, 2] and other large genomic databases [5,
6]. Thirty-seven distinct amplifications were found, the
most common being CCND1 (12 patients), MYC (12
patients), MCL1 (7 patients), HER2 (ERBB2; 7 patients),
and FGFR1 (6 patients). All amplifications had been
previously reported in breast cancer.
Many, if not most, of the genomic aberrations
represent actionable targets, either by approved drugs
or by agents in clinical trials [7, 9-14]. Among the most
common aberrations were those seen in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway (Supplemental Table 2) [7, 8]: PIK3CA
mutations with eight different variants were noted (15
patients, including 3 patients with more than one variant);
PIK3CA amplifications (3 patients); PTEN deletions (6
patients); PIK3R1 mutation (5 patients with 4 different
mutation variants); AKT3 amplifications (2 patients); and

PTEN or AKT1 mutation (1 patient each). Other druggable
aberrations include, but are not limited to, EGFR, HER2,
CDKN2A, FGFR/FGF family, KRAS, MDM2, BRCA2,
and more.
Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis
that metastatic tumors, even when originating in the same
organ (e.g., the breast), are mostly distinct at the molecular
level (malignant snowflakes) [9]. Of special interest,
many of the genomic aberrations we observed may be
actionable, through either direct or indirect ‘cross talk’
signal suppression [7, 9-14]. For instance, prior literature
indicates that PIK3CA is the oncogene showing the highest
frequency of gain-of-function mutations in breast cancer
[7, 10-12] (ranging from ~13% in TNBC to ~42% in HR
positive+/HER2- subgroup) [10]. In our study, PIK3CA
was the second most common aberrant gene, and was
involved in 12% of abnormalities (Supplemental Table
2). Further, if patients with other molecular alterations in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are included (e.g. PTEN,
AKT, PIK3R1, etc), the subset of patients expands. Of
therapeutic interest, the BOLERO-2 study of the hormone
modulator exemestane and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
showed that patients whose tumors had 0 or 1 genomic
aberrations in PIK3CA or FGFR pathways or in CCND1
had better outcomes [13]. Further, we previously reported
that heavily pretreated patients with PIK3CA-mutant
breast and gynecologic tumors have higher than expected
response rates (partial/complete response rates ~30%)
when mTOR inhibitor-based combination regimens are
administered [11, 14, 15]. However, despite the large
percentage of aberrations (Supplemental Table 2) that
can be targeted by drugs that are already approved or in
clinical trials, our data illustrates why current clinical trials
and practice generally provide only short-lived tumor
regressions. In particular, the fact that most patients have
multiple aberrations, and that the abnormalities differ from
individual to individual, suggests that treating different
patients with the same drug or drug combination may be
insufficient to optimize success.
There are limitations to our data: the number of
patients we analyzed was small and, in some cases,
different aberrations in the same gene may have a similar
effect on the downstream pathway. However, even if we
considered all aberrations in the same gene as functionally
equivalent (a highly unlikely situation), 95% (54 of 57)
of our patients still had distinct genomic portfolios.
The reality that NGS interrogation of these tumors has
revealed is that, since most patients with metastatic
breast malignancies have unique genomic landscapes, the
standard methods deployed for therapeutic prosecution of
molecular aberrations may need to be revised.
Classic clinical trial design mandates grouping
patients by tumor site and histology (e.g., breast or
colon cancer) and evaluating the efficacy of a drug or
combination of agents. In the era of molecular therapeutics,
the first generation of newer clinical trial designs stratify
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients, often on the basis of a single molecular aberration
as identified by a companion diagnostic, and test the
efficacy of a cognate inhibitor to improve outcomes.
The latter model represents a scientifically rational
advancement that has been successful to an extent. Indeed,
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer respond to
trastuzumab, lapatinib, and pertuzumab [16], and ALKrearranged advanced lung tumors respond to the ALK
inhibitor crizotinib [17]. However, the majority of patients
do not achieve durable responses. It is not surprising that
these tactics fail to provide long-term survival benefit
since our current observations suggest that each patient,
despite the commonality of the anomaly that stratifies
them for the clinical trial/treatment, has a distinct aberrant
molecular backdrop. Indeed, these novel clinical trials
using companion diagnostics to select patients so that
an appropriately targeted agent can be tested are still
retrofitting our new knowledge about metastatic cancer–at
the molecular level, each patient has a unique and complex
tumor–into a dated clinical trial paradigm where patients
are grouped together to evaluate a drug.
Previously, we have shown that, using genomic
aberrations to match patients with advanced, heavilypretreated malignancies (including breast cancer) to drugs,
in the context of phase I studies, resulted in improved
outcomes as assessed by response rate, progression-free
survival and overall survival, as well as progressionfree survival on matched Phase I therapy as compared
to last conventional therapy; in the case of melanoma,
progression-free survival on matched phase I therapy was
improved as compared to first-line treatment [8, 11, 18,
19]. Of interest, these studies used the first-generation
molecular profiling technology available at the time (i.e.
tumors were probed for gene aberrations one at a time,
rather than with next generation sequencing). Further
trials employing next generation sequencing, as well as
additional advanced omic technologies, and randomized
designs are warranted.
In summary, NGS may represent a disruptive
technology that mandates a new approach to clinical
research and cancer treatment. Even if there is some
convergence of pathways with functional impact [20-23],
introduction of additional omics tests–transcriptomics,
proteomics, epigenomics etc.–may reveal yet more
complexity and differences between patients’ tumors
leading to major challenges in personalized treatment. The
complexity of the molecular genetics of metastatic cancer
is not conducive to the success of classic drug-centric
clinical trial models, where patients are grouped together
in order to test the efficacy of a drug or combination. We
propose testing a new patient-centric, molecular matching
strategy to find an optimal treatment regimen tailored to
each patient’s genomic profile acquired from multi-assay
molecular testing. Importantly, this approach would permit
the therapy given to vary from individual to individual
consistent with N-of-One customization. The framework

for such a trial would utilize genomics and/or other
omic technologies to navigate patients to individualized
therapy. Forerunners of this design have been utilized in
the IMPACT/PREDICT trials (NCT00851032) [8], as
well as newer trials such as WINther (the latter utilizing
both genomics and transcriptomics to type patients)
(NCT01856296) and the planned NCI MATCH trial [24].
These trials concentrated on finding matches for single
aberrations; next generation trials can exploit the same
design, but deploy advanced multiplex technology, and
focus on appropriate tailored combinations.

METHODS
Fifty-seven sequential consented patients with
advanced, pathologically confirmed breast cancer who
had next generation sequencing (182 to 236 genes) were
analyzed. Tumor samples were evaluated for genomic
alterations including base substitutions, short insertions
and deletions, amplifications, homozygous deletions,
gene fusions, truncations and rearrangements (Foundation
Medicine, Cambridge, MA). DNA was extracted from
40 μm of FFPE tissue (minimum 20% tumor cells) using
the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA Purification kit
(Promega) and quantified using a standardized PicoGreen
fluorescence assay (Invitrogen). Library Construction
was performed using 50-200 ng of DNA sheared by
sonication to ~100-400 bp before end-repair, dA addition
and ligation of indexed, Illumina sequencing adaptors.
Enrichment of target sequences (all coding exons of 182
or 236 cancer-related genes and selected introns from
14 or 19 genes recurrently rearranged in cancer) was
achieved by solution-based hybrid capture with custom
biotinylated oligonucleotide baits. Enriched libraries
were sequenced to an average median depth of >500X
with 99% of bases covered >100X (Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform using 49 × 49 paired-end reads) and mapped to
the reference human genome (hg19) using the BurrowsWheeler Aligner and the publicly available SAMtools,
Picard and Genome Analysis Toolkit. Point mutations
were identified by a Bayesian algorithm; short insertions
and deletions, determined by local assembly; gene copy
number alterations (amplifications), by comparison to
process matched normal controls; and gene fusions/
rearrangements, by clustering chimeric reads mapped to
targeted introns. Local site permissions to use clinical
samples were also obtained.
