BACKGROUND: Patients with pure teratoma within the postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) specimen traditionally have been considered at low risk for disease progression. The
objectives of this study were to determine the disease-related outcomes of patients who had pure teratoma identified at the time of PC-RPLND and to examine the prognostic value of clinical variables that
were identified previously as important predictors of disease recurrence in these patients. METHODS:
Between 1980 and 2003, 97 patients with metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor and pure teratoma
histology at the time of PC-RPLND were identified. The medical records of these patients were reviewed
retrospectively for pertinent clinical and treatment-related outcomes. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of
7.4 years, 21 patients (22%) developed recurrent disease after PC-RPLND. The 5-year and 10-year probabilities (standard error) of freedom from disease recurrence were 81%  4% and 76%  5%, respectively. The
postchemotherapy a-fetoprotein (AFP) level and mediastinal involvement at presentation were statistically
significant predictors of disease recurrence on multivariate analysis. Nine of 97 patients (9.3%) died from
testis cancer, and 4 patients died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with pure teratoma histology
at PC-RPLND, mediastinal involvement at presentation and the presence of an elevated AFP level before
PC-RPLND predicted an unfavorable outcome. The absence of mediastinal involvement and normal AFP
level, however, did not confirm freedom from disease recurrence. Patients who had teratoma at the time of
PC-RPLND remained at considerable risk for disease progression because of the unpredictable nature of
teratoma and the presence of unrecognized, active germ cell disease outside the retroperitoneum. Cancer

Pure teratoma is identified in 40% of men who undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection
(RPLND) for metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) after chemotherapy, whereas viable germ cell tumor (GCT) is discovered in 10% to 15%, and fibrosis or necrosis is discovered in 40% to

Outcome for Postchemotherapy Teratoma/Svatek et al

teratoma is unpredictable because of the potential for malignant degeneration or the development of growing teratoma syndrome.2-5 In addition, patients who undergo
postchemotherapy RPLND (PC-RPLND) may harbor
micrometastases that are undetectable with current diagnostic modalities.6,7
Recurrence rates for patients with teratoma histology at PC-RPLND range from 6% to 39%.3,4,8-13 Previous series have identified several prognostic variables that
may identify patients at high-risk for disease recurrence
despite the detection of pure teratoma at PC-RPLND.3,14
Loehrer et al3 identified mediastinal primary tumor site,
tumor burden, and the presence of immature teratoma
histology as significant predictors of disease recurrence on
univariate analysis. Carver et al14 identified International
Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) risk
classification15 and postchemotherapy tumor size as important predictors of disease recurrence.
In the current study, we examined the long-term
outcome of men who had pure teratoma histology identified at time they underwent PC-RPLND at our institution.
In addition, we sought to validate the prognostic value of
clinical variables that previously were identified as important predictors of disease recurrence in these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was performed after it was approved by the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. From the institution’s tumor
registry, 408 men who were treated for primary testis tumor were identified from January 1980 to July 2003. Of
the 377 patients for whom complete medical charts were
available, 141 had clinical stage I or IS disease and were
excluded. From the remaining 236 patients who underwent PC-RPLND, 97 patients (41%) had pure teratoma
histology identified at the time of PC-RPLND. Clinical
stage was assigned according to the 1997 tumor-lymph
node-metastasis (TNM) staging system. Patients were
categorized into 3 prognostic groups (good risk, intermediate risk, and poor risk) according to the 1997 IGCCCG
guidelines.15 IGCCCG risk categories could be assigned
in 83 patients; the remaining patients (n ¼ 14) could not

be assigned to any risk group because of missing tumor
marker information.
For all patients, a complete medical evaluation was
performed before the PC-RPLND, including measurements of serum a-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
and radiologic evaluation comprised of chest and abdominal/pelvic computed tomography scans. The largest
transverse dimension of the retroperitoneal mass, as determined by abdominal imaging, was noted. Clinical variables, including diagnostic findings, treatment type, and
patient outcomes, were recorded along with postoperative
surgical variables.
All patients received systemic chemotherapy before
the underwent PC-RPLND. The chemotherapeutic regimens that were selected for patients varied, depending on
the protocols used around the time of diagnosis. In the
1980s, patients received alternating cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CISCA) and vinblastine plus bleomycin (VB). All patients who had
NSGCT received 2 cycles of chemotherapy beyond normalization of serum tumor markers, thereby receiving a
minimum of 4 chemotherapy cycles.16 In the 1990s,
patients continued to receive alternating cycles of CISCA
and VB with a 20% dose reduction.17 However, patients
in the poor-risk IGCCCG category were given alternating
dose-dense chemotherapy.18 Before 1997, patients with
small-volume disease received combined carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. In recent years, 3 cycles of combined bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin or 4 cycles of
combined etoposide and cisplatin have been given to
patients with good-risk NSGCT. For analysis, AFP was
analyzed both as a continuous and as a categorical variable
(normal AFP, <15 ng/mL), and hCG was analyzed as a
continuous or categorical variable (normal hCG, <2.2
mIU/mL).19 A full bilateral-template PC-RPLND was
performed in all patients, and all pathologic specimens
from the testis primary site and the retroperitoneum or
other metastatic sites were reviewed by genitourinary
pathologists. The pathologic findings of the PC-RPLND
pure teratoma specimens were categorized as either immature teratoma or mature teratoma.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are reported as medians with the
interquartile (IQ) range. The Kaplan-Meier method was
1311

Original Article

used to estimate disease-specific survival and recurrencefree survival, and differences were assessed with the logrank test statistic. Disease-specific death was defined as
death resulting from testicular cancer or its treatment in
the setting of progressive disease. Patients who died of
other causes were censored at the date of their death. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed
using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Cases with missing values were excluded in a list-wise
manner during univariate and multivariate analysis. The
lowest category was used as the referent category when calculating the hazards ratios for categorical variables.
Because of the small number of patients in each subcategory, patients with clinical stage IIA, IIB, and IIC disease
were compared against patients with clinical stage III disease during univariate and multivariate analyses. Statistical significance in this study was set as P  .050. All
reported P values are 2-sided. All analyses were performed
with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
The clinical characteristics of the 97 patients who had
pure teratoma identified in the PC-RPLND specimen are
listed in Table 1. Primary testis tumor histology was available for 96 patients. The most common histology was
mixed NSGCT (83.5%), and the remaining tumor histologic types were pure embryonal carcinoma (9.3%), pure
teratoma (5.2%), and pure seminoma (1.0%). The clinical tumor classification of the primary tumor most frequently was T1 (57.7%) followed by T2 (25.8%), and
most patients presented with a lymph node status of either
N2 (43.3%) or N3 (39.2%). Clinical M1a and M1b disease was present in 37.1% and 13.4% of patients, respectively. The median serum AFP level before PC-RPLND
was 2.8 ng/mL (IQ range, 1.9-4.3 ng/mL). The median
serum hCG level before PC-RPLND was 1 mIU/mL (IQ
range, 1-1 mIU/mL). The median postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node size was 3 cm (IQ range, 2.4-5
cm). A median of 17 lymph nodes was removed per PCRPLND specimen (IQ range, 10-25.5 lymph nodes).
Histology at PC-RPLND was available for 91 patients,
including 14 (15.4%) who had immature teratoma and
77 (84.6%) who had mature teratoma. No histology was
identified as teratoma with malignant degeneration. The

3). Recurrence histology revealed mature teratoma (62%)
or viable GCT (38%) in patients with disease recurrence
(Table 2). The median number of chemotherapy cycles
was similar for those who experienced disease recurrence
(median, 5, cycles; IQ range, 1.25-8.75 cycles) and those
without disease recurrences (median, 5 cycles; IQ range,
2-8 cycles). The median time from PC-RPLND to disease
recurrence was 21 months (IQ range, 11.1-70.2 months)
for those who remained alive or who died of other causes
at the time they were censored compared with a median of
6.7 months (IQ range, 3.2-11 months) for those who died
of testis cancer (P ¼ .028). The 5-year and 10-year probabilities of freedom from disease recurrence (standard
error) were 81%  4% and 76%  5%, respectively.
The results of univariate and multivariate analyses
for predicting disease recurrence are shown in Table 3.
Higher clinical stage, disease site (mediastinum or lung) at
presentation, poor IGCCCG risk group, and an elevated
1314

postchemotherapy AFP level were significant predictors
of disease recurrence on univariate analysis. The presence
of mediastinal disease at presentation and postchemotherapy AFP level retained statistical significance as predictors
of recurrence after adjusting for covariates. Because clinical stage and disease site at presentation have overlapping
features, a separate multivariate analysis was performed after removal of the clinical stage variable. In this model,
poor IGCCCG risk group and the involvement of liver
and lung at presentation still were not associated significantly with disease recurrence. The presence of mediastinal disease at presentation and postchemotherapy AFP
level retained statistical significance as predictors of recurrence, but their hazard ratios changed somewhat (mediastinal involvement: hazards ratio, 7.4 [95% confidence
interval (95% CI), 1.9-28.7]; elevated vs normal AFP:
hazards ratio, 14.5 [95% CI,, 2.4-88.6]). To represent the
individual and combined abilities of these variables to
predict disease recurrence, a cross tabulation is provided

Of the 97 patients who had pure teratoma at PCRPLND, 9 patients (9.3%) died from testis cancer, and 4
patients died from other causes. For these 9 patients, the
median time from PC-RPLND to death was 9.7 months
(IQ range, 5-73.9 months). Histology at the time of recurrence demonstrated viable GCT in 6 patients and teratoma was in 3 patients. The 10-year cumulative diseasespecific survival probability (standard error) was 90% 
4%. The 5- and 10-year cumulative overall survival probabilities (standard error) were 81%  5% and 76% 
6%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Patients with pure teratoma histology on PC-RPLND
have a variable clinical course that depends on a complete
surgical dissection and the presence of unrecognized viable germ cell elements outside the retroperitoneum. At a
median follow-up >7 years, this series provides outcomes
for patients with the longest follow-up duration published
to date. Disease recurrence was identified in 21 of 97
patients (22%), including 8 recurrences with viable GCT.
The corresponding 10-year probability of freedom from
disease recurrence (standard error) was 76%  5%.
Postchemotherapy AFP levels and the presence of mediastinal involvement at presentation were associated significantly with disease recurrence.

Although it assumed generally that they have a
favorable prognosis, several contemporary series have
revealed a high frequency of disease recurrence in patients
who have pure teratoma histology after chemotherapy.3,4,14 Loehrer et al3 identified 51 patients with pure
teratoma on PC-RPLND and reported disease recurrence
in 20 (39%). The histology of the recurrence was distributed evenly between pure teratoma and viable disease.
Sonneveld et al4 reported disease recurrence in 9 of 51
patients (9.8%), including 5 recurrences with mature teratoma, 3 with non-GCT, and 1 with viable GCT. In what
to our knowledge is the largest series published to date,
Carver et al14 observed disease recurrence in 30 of 210
patients (14%) who had retroperitoneal teratoma after
chemotherapy. Ten of those 30 patients (33%) had developed disease recurrence with teratoma, 5 (17%) had teratoma with malignant transformation, and 15 (50%) had
viable GCT.
Disease recurrence for patients with pure teratoma
at PC-RPLND is caused either by incomplete retroperitoneal surgical resection or by unrecognized disease metastases at the time of surgery. Similar to other series,3,14 we
observed that most recurrences occurred in extraretroperitoneal sites. Nevertheless, despite undergoing a complete
bilateral-template PC-RPLND resection, 3 patients developed recurrent tumor in the retroperitoneum, including 1
patient who subsequently died from disease. This finding
emphasizes the need for a meticulous surgical approach to
treating these patients regardless of suspected histologic
subtype.
The possibility of unrecognized disease metastasis at
the time of surgery must be considered when following
patients after PC-RPLND. Histologic findings of fibrosis
and/or necrosis on postchemotherapy retroperitoneal histology have been associated with disease recurrence rates
of 5% to 18%.6,7,20 Active GCT outside the retroperitoneum developed in 19% of our patients despite normal
tumor markers and pure teratoma at the time of PCRPLND. Staging for patients who undergo PC-RPLND
clearly is subject to the limitations of current staging
modalities for testis cancer.
The ability to identify variables that could identify
the patients who are likely to develop recurrent disease despite having retroperitoneal teratoma after chemotherapy
would be invaluable for prognostication and timely delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Loehrer et al3 identified
1315

Original Article

the initial tumor burden, the presence of immature teratoma, and mediastinal disease site as significant predictors
of disease recurrence on univariate analysis, and the presence of immature teratomatous elements and mediastinal
disease site were significant on multivariate analyses. In
their multivariate analyses, Carver et al14 reported that
increased size of the residual mass after chemotherapy and
higher IGCCCG risk classification were significant predictors of disease recurrence. Our analysis also suggests a
predictive role for IGCCCG risk stratification, although
this predictor was unable to maintain prognostic significance on multivariate analyses. This discrepancy may be
caused in part by differences between study populations.
Generally, patients from our series represent a more heavily treated population: 39% of men underwent secondline chemotherapy compared with 9% from the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) series.14 In
addition, the MSKCC dataset excluded 5 patients who
had progressive, viable GCT despite RPLND.14 In contrast, our series included all patients with disease recurrence after RPLND, even those who developed a
recurrence within 2 months. Although these patients may
never have experienced a disease-free interval, RPLND
was performed with curative intent and in the absence of
obvious metastatic lesions.
In the current series, patients with mediastinal disease site at presentation or an elevated serum AFP after
chemotherapy were at higher risk for disease recurrence.
This is consistent with the finding that, given the early
time to recurrence and the absence of teratoma with malignant degeneration in recurrence histology, many of our
patients with recurrence likely had unrecognized, viable
germ cell elements. Historically elevated tumor marker
levels after chemotherapy have been a relative contraindication to RPLND. However, several contemporary series
have demonstrated that select patients with elevated tumor marker levels can be cured with surgery.21-23 Therefore, these patients were not excluded from our analysis.
Although elevated serum AFP level before PC-RPLND
and the presence of mediastinal disease site at presentation
were identified as predictors of disease recurrence in this
analysis, these data do not support altering surveillance
strategies based on the presence or absence of these features. The confidence intervals for the hazard ratios associated with these 2 prognostic variables are wide, as shown
in Table 4, indicating imprecision in the corresponding
1316

point estimates. This also is explained by the finding that,
although all 4 patients with elevated postchemotherapy
AFP levels experienced disease recurrence, most patients
with disease recurrence did not have elevated postchemotherapy AFP levels. Furthermore, although 7 of 9 patients
with mediastinal disease at presentation suffered disease
recurrence after PC-RPLND, approximately 66% of
patients who experienced disease recurrence did not present with mediastinal disease involvement.
Nine of the patients in our study (9.3%) died from
testis cancer, including 3 patients who recurred with teratoma. Loehrer et al3 also observed that a significant number of patients with postchemotherapy teratoma died
from disease. Of their 51 patients, 15.7% died from testis
cancer, including 6 who developed disease recurrence
with active GCT and 2 who recurred with teratoma.
Others have reported lower proportions of cancer-related
death among their patients. Sonneveld et al4 reported a
2% incidence of death from disease with a median followup duration of 51 months. Similarly, Carver et al14
observed death from disease in 4.7% of their 210 patients.
We acknowledge several limitations to the current
study. Because the study is retrospective, it suffers from an
inherent selection bias, which is common to most
RPLND surgical series.24 The assessment of surgical specimen pathology is subject to differences in reporting practices among our institution’s genitourinary pathologists.
In addition, our surgical series extended over 25 years;
changes occurred in preoperative chemotherapeutic regimens during that period, and the generalizability of these
findings is not known. Despite these limitations, this analysis is an important contribution to the existing knowledge of outcomes for patients with retroperitoneal
teratoma after chemotherapy.
In conclusion, patients with retroperitoneal pure
teratoma after chemotherapy are at significant risk of disease progression because of the unpredictable nature of
teratoma and the presence of unrecognized, viable germ
cell disease outside the retroperitoneum. Although the
presence of mediastinal involvement at presentation or an
elevated AFP before PC-RPLND help predict which
patients will suffer from recurrence, these variables are not
sufficiently accurate to be used as the bases for surveillance
modification or treatment decisions. Therefore, until
improved diagnostic modalities are available to identify
patients who harbor micrometastases, patients with pure
