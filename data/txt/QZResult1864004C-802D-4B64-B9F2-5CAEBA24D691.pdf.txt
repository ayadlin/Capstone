BACKGROUND: Imexon (Amplimexon) is an aziridine compound that increases reactive oxygen species, disrupts mitochondrial membranes, and induces apoptosis. Preclinical studies showed activity against melanoma cell lines and
models in mice, and synergy with dacarbazine. The authors evaluated standard doses of dacarbazine combined with
increasing doses of imexon to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. METHODS: Sixty-eight chemotherapy-naive melanoma patients (1 inoperable stage III and 67 stage IV) were
treated with dacarbazine (250 mg/m2) and imexon (570-1300 mg/m2), both daily for 5 days every 3 weeks.
RESULTS: There were 18 patients in the phase 1, and 50 in the phase 2 component of the study. The MTD of imexon
with dacarbazine was 1000 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicities were pulmonary edema and hepatorenal failure. At the
MTD, therapy was well tolerated. The most common toxicities (any grade) were vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, fever, and constipation. Among 68 patients, there were 7 treatment-related serious adverse
events. Partial response and stable disease rates were 5.9% and 25% for all subjects and 2% and 30% for the phase 2
patients, respectively. Median progression-free and overall survival of all patients were 2.0 and 11.7 months and 2 and
7.5 months for the phase 2 patients, respectively. Overall survival of the 31 patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase levels was >22.5 months. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were similar to previous reports. CONCLUSIONS:
Imexon plus dacarbazine was well tolerated. The survival data suggest further evaluation in a randomized phase 2

There are approximately 8800 cases of metastatic melanoma (stage IV) in the United States per year and approximately
the same number in Western Europe.1 Standard US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies include
dacarbazine and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Dacarbazine was associated with a survival of approximately 8 months in
a recent large study.2 High-dose IL-2 can be given safely to only a subset of patients. Approximately 6% of highly selected
patients treated with IL-2 have long-term disease-free survival.3,4 in a large meta-analysis of phase 2 studies done in 5 cooperative groups, the median overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma was 6.2 months.5 Temozolomide, although
not approved by the FDA for melanoma, is widely used and has a response rate and survival similar to that of dacarbazine.6
Although many promising new agents and combinations are under study, none has thus far shown a survival benefit in
phase 3 trials.2,7-10 Thus, new agents and regimens are needed for this disease.
Imexon (Amplimexon, AmpliMed Corporation, Tucson, Ariz) is a novel aziridine-containing compound. It binds
to thiols, leading to mitochondrial damage and leakage of cytochrome C with resultant induction of apoptosis.11 The
mechanism involves an increase in reactive oxygen species in cancer cells, which are known to already be under oxidative
stress.12 Imexon was shown to be highly active in killing fresh melanoma cells in an in vitro stem cell assay, is active against
various melanoma cell lines in vitro, and is also active in inhibiting the growth of human melanoma cell lines growing in

the SCID mouse.13-16 Imexon was shown to be synergistic
both in vitro and in vivo with a variety of anticancer
agents, including alkylating agents and dacarbazine.17
The antitumor effects of dacarbazine and other alkylating
agents have previously been shown to be abrogated by the
addition of glutathione.17 Therefore, depletion of glutathione by imexon might augment the activity of these
agents. Imexon is also synergistic with several other anticancer agents in murine models and is currently being
evaluated in combination therapy studies with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer and with docetaxel in nonsmall
cell lung cancer.18,19
The objectives of this study were to assess the overall
toxicities and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of the
combination of imexon with dacarbazine. We also wished
to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the
combination. The pharmacokinetics of the 2 agents was
also evaluated, particularly to see if either influenced the
other, and we wished to make a preliminary assessment of
the antitumor efficacy of the combination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Drug Administration
This was an open-label phase 1 dose escalation study with
a phase 2 extension at the MTD of imexon with dacarbazine. In the phase 1 portion, in a 3 þ 3 design, 3 to 6 consecutive patients were entered at dose levels of 570, 750,
1000, and 1300 mg/m2 of imexon until the MTD was
determined. A starting dose of 570 mg/m2 was chosen
based on prior studies that indicated that the MTD of
imexon in repeated 5 day courses was 875 mg/m2. Therefore, starting at 65% of the MTD was considered safe. Six
patients were treated at the MTD to confirm the tolerability of that dose. Subsequently, the phase 2 component was
conducted to assess the potential for clinical benefit using
a Simon 2 stage design. An initial 27 patients were
entered, and if at least 9 achieved a complete response
(CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD), an
additional 18 were to be entered for a planned total of 45
patients in the phase 2 component.
Imexon was administered as a 30- to 45-minute
infusion daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Thirty
minutes after each dose of imexon, dacarbazine was
administered at 250 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, also daily
for 5 days every 3 weeks.
Screening consisted of a blood cell count, blood
chemistries including electrolyte, mineral renal, and liver
values, and radiographic studies. Because of the pro-oxi-

3684

dant mechanism of action of imexon, the blood level of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was measured at
screening, and patients who had levels less than the lower
limits of institutional normal were excluded. In addition
to the standard monitoring of blood counts and blood
chemistries, the pharmacokinetics of both agents was
studied on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Radiographic evaluation of
disease was done pretherapy and at Days 60 and 120 after
the start of therapy and then every 3 months thereafter. If
a patient manifested a response, the response was confirmed with a repeat radiographic assessment 1 month
later. Radiographic evaluation was performed by each
investigator’s radiologist. In addition, if a patient went off
study for any reason, the end of study evaluation was completed within 1 week and consisted of a history, physical
exam, complete blood counts, blood chemistries, and radiographic disease evaluation.
Pharmacokinetic studies of both drugs were performed on Day 1 of dosing in the phase 2 portion of the
study in selected patients. Blood samples were collected at
7 time points from the end of infusion up to 2.5 hours
afterward. Blood was immediately separated into plasma
by centrifugation and then stored at 80 C before analysis at Aptuit Laboratories (Edinburgh, UK).
The study was designed and conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review
boards of the participating institutions and in accordance
with their assurances filed with the Department of Health
and Human Services. Written informed consent was
obtained from each subject before initiation of any studyrelated activities. Bioanalysis was conducted in a contract
research laboratory.
Patient Population
Eligible patients were chemotherapy naive, aged 18 years
or older, with inoperable, histologically confirmed stage
III or IV melanoma, measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0-1, a projected life expectancy of 4 months, no serious
concomitant diseases, no other concurrent cancers or cancer treatments, and no brain metastases. Pregnant or nursing women were excluded. Also required were a normal
cardiac ejection fraction and no history of recent angina
or myocardial infarction in the prior 3 months. Patients
with respiratory insufficiency requiring oxygen therapy
were excluded. Laboratory values were required to be
within acceptable protocol-defined ranges. The patients
were required to have completed any other cancer therapy

at least 4 weeks before the start of protocol therapy, and
not to be receiving parenteral antibiotics or systemic steroid therapy.
Objectives
The primary objectives of the phase 1 component were to
determine the MTD, the toxicity profile, and the tolerability of the combination of imexon with dacarbazine.
The objectives of the phase 2 component of the study
were to determine the objective response rate
(CR þ PR þ SD) and the percentage of patients who were
progression free at 60 days. Another objective was to
determine whether the efficacy was of sufficient interest to
proceed to larger controlled clinical trials. Secondary
objectives included determination of response duration,
progression-free survival (PFS), and OS.
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Imexon was measured in plasma samples using reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
technique with mass spectrometry detection.20 The assay
method was developed and validated by Aptuit.
The assay methods for dacarbazine and its primary
metabolite, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide (AIC),
used reverse-phase HPLC with ultraviolet detection and
were developed and instituted by Aptuit.
The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for
each patient using WinNonlin Pro version 4.0.1 (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, Calif). Data are presented as
the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation
[CV]). Pharmacokinetic parameters included: 1) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax); 2) time to Cmax
(tmax); 3) area under the plasma  concentration time
curve, from start of infusion to the last quantifiable concentration (AUCOt), calculated by the linear trapezoidal
rule; 4) the plasma half-life; 5) clearance of drug from
plasma, calculated as actual dose/AUC; and 6) the volume
of distribution at steady state, Vss, calculated as drug
clearance  mean residence time. Results for 2 different
infusion times, 30 minutes and 45 minutes, and comparisons between men and women in the 30-minute infusion
cohort were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance
(ANOVA).
Statistical Analysis
All patients who received at least 1 dose of the study medications were included in the toxicity and efficacy analyses.
The last 6 patients entered on the phase 1 component at
the MTD constituted the first 6 patients of the phase 2

component of the trial. A Simon 2-stage minimax
design21 was used based on the assumption that 38% of
patients on dacarbazine alone would be progression free at
60 days. The planned total phase 2 sample size was 45
patients. This was based on testing a null hypothesis that
the true PFS rate at 60 days is 38% versus an alternative
hypothesis that the true PFS rate at 60 days is 55%. In
part 1 of phase 2, 27 patients were to be entered, and if at
least 9 were progression free at 60 days, then part 2 would
be initiated and another 18 patients would be enrolled. If
at least 22 of 45 were progression free at 60 days, then
the combination would be considered sufficiently promising to move to a larger randomized trial. Response rate,
PFS, OS, and toxicity parameters were evaluated using
descriptive statistics. PFS and OS curves were plotted by
the method of Kaplan and Meier. Pharmacokinetic differences between infusion times and dose-levels were
compared using ANOVA, with P < .05 denoting statistical significance.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Sixty-eight subjects were entered on the study, 18 in phase
1 and 50 in phase 2. There were 42 men and 26 women,
with a median age of 59 years (range, 24-84 years). There
were 66 Caucasians, 1 black, and 1 patient reported as
‘‘other.’’ Performance status distribution was ECOG-0
46%, ECOG-1 51%, and ECOG-2 3%. One patient had
inoperable stage III disease, and 67 had stage IV disease at
study entry. Of the stage IV patients, 5 (7.5%) patients
were classified as M1a, 9 (13.4%) patients as M1b, and 53
(79.1%) as M1c. Liver metastases were present in 49% of
the subjects, and 54% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) levels. The median size of the sum of the target
lesions at baseline for all patients was 8.25 cm. None of
the patients had prior chemotherapy, and 21 (30.9%) had
prior immunotherapy. Of these, 11 had interferon only,
and 10 had other immunotherapies such as vaccines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or dendritic cells with or without interferon. All consented patients
who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose
of the study regimen were included in the analyses of toxicity and efficacy.
In the phase 1 dose escalation part of the study, 3
patients received 570 mg/m2 of imexon, 6 patients
received 750 mg/m2, 6 patients received 1000 mg/m2
(1 patient had a DLT of grade 3 pulmonary edema/dyspnea), and 3 patients received 1300 mg/m2, of whom 1

patient had a DLT of grade 4 hepatorenal failure. All subjects received dacarbazine at 250 mg/m2. In phase 2, the
subjects received a median of 3 cycles of treatment (range,
1-10), and there were no DLTs. The starting dose was set
at 570 mg/m2, as it already had been determined in the
phase 1 single-agent study that the MTD of the daily  5
regimen was 875 mg/m2.
Toxicity
One DLT was reported among the 6 patients in the phase
1 component receiving 1000 mg/m2, a grade 3 pulmonary
edema/dyspnea, and 1 DLT was reported among the 3
patients receiving 1300 mg/m2, a grade 4 acute hepatorenal failure. Per protocol, if any patient at a particular dosage level experienced a grade 4 toxicity, then that dosage
level was considered to be above the MTD, and no further
subjects were enrolled at that dosage level. Table 1 shows
the adverse events regardless of grade and causality as well
as the grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring at any time
during the course of treatment. Most were mild and readily managed with symptomatic measures. The most common toxicities of any grade were vomiting, diarrhea,
anemia, thrombocytopenia, anorexia, fever, and constipation. Grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia were not seen in any patients on the combination

3686

regimen during the first cycle of treatment, although they
did occur with low frequency later in the course of therapy. Over the course of the study treatment, 2 (3.2%)
patients experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia, 2 patients
experienced grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, and 4 (6.1%)
patients experienced grade 3/4 anemia.
There were 34 serious adverse events during all
cycles of therapy in the 68 patients. Seven of these were
considered possibly related to the investigational therapy.
These events, their grade, the dose level at which they
were seen, and the investigator-assessed relationship to
therapy are shown in Table 2. All were classified as possibly related to the therapy by the investigators.
Efficacy
The baseline characteristics of the phase 1 and phase 2
patients and all patients are given in Table 3. Four (5.9%)
of all the patients in the intent-to-treat population had a
confirmed PR, and 17 (25%) had SD at 2 months. Two
percent of the phase 2 patients had a confirmed PR, and
30% had SD at 2 months. There was a better response
rate in phase 1 subjects versus phase 2 subjects. The number of patients is too small to determine the significance of
this observation. Median PFS and OS in all patients were
2.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.1) and

11.7 months (95% CI, 6.8-17.3), respectively. In the
phase 2 patients, they were 2 months (95% CI, 1.9-2.1)
and 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.8-13). In patients with normal serum LDH (n ¼ 31), the PFS and OS were 1.9
months (95% CI, 1.9-6.5) and 22.5þ months (95% CI,
16.7 months to undetermined). In the patients with elevated LDH (n ¼ 37), PFS and OS were 2.0 months (95%
CI, 1.4-2.0) and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.2-8.8), respectively. The OS survival curves for all patients, the phase 2
patients, and those with normal LDH are shown in Figures 1 to 3. Among the first 27 patients in part 1 of the
phase 2 component, 13 (48.1%) patients were progression
free at 60 days, and in the 50 patients in part 2, 17 (37%)
patients were progression free at 60 days.
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Eight patients at the 1000 mg/m2/d dose level, including
6 men and 2 women, had imexon pharmacokinetics studied. Imexon blood samples were analyzed in an additional

3 patients, but half-life, clearance, and Vss could not be
calculated, because a monoexponential terminal decline
could not be unambiguously identified. Nine patients
were studied for dacarbazine and AIC pharmacokinetics
at the dacarbazine 250 mg/m2/d dose level. The latter
group included 7 men and 2 women.
Table 4 shows the pharmacokinetic parameters of
imexon, dacarbazine, and its metabolite AIC in patients
receiving 1000 mg/m2 of imexon administered as 30- or
45-minute infusions followed by 250 mg/m2 dacarbazine
administered as a 30- or 45-minute infusion. When the
pharmacokinetic parameters for dacarbazine in this study
were compared with those previously published,22,23 there
were no differences in any of the parameters, so it was concluded that the administration of imexon was unlikely to
have altered the pharmacokinetics of dacarbazine.
Plasma imexon pharmacokinetics at the 1000 mg/m2
dose level were measured for up to 2.5 hours after the end
of infusion at both infusion times. Table 4 shows that the

geometric mean (CV) for Cmax ranged from 62 lg/mL
(28.2) at the 30-minute infusion time (n ¼ 4 men and 2
women) to 38.5 lg/mL (38.8) at the 45-minute infusion
time (n ¼ 3 men) (P > .05). There was also no significant
difference for the tmax between the means for the 2 infusion times. Also, nonsignificant differences were observed
for the AUC0-t (which ranged from 55.3 to 82.1
hours  lg/mL), the t1/2, which averaged about 1 hour,
drug clearance, which ranged from 15.0 to 22.8 L/h/m2,
and the Vss, which ranged from 15.0 to 22.8 L/m2. As in
the prior phase 1 pharmacokinetic study,20 the Vss of
imexon was greater than extracellular water, but less than
total body water, which suggests limited penetration into
tissues. There was no difference between pharmacokinetic
parameters in the 4 men and 2 women for the 30-minute
imexon infusion (data not shown).

For the pharmacokinetic parameters for dacarbazine
and its metabolite AIC for the 2 different dacarbazine
infusion times (30 and 45 minutes), Cmax values ranged
from 4.77 to 8.46 lg/mL, but there were no significant
differences between any infusion times (Table 4). The
mean t1/2 was just over 50 minutes for dacarbazine. The
mean Vss was about 27 L/m2, which is greater than total
body water, which suggests extensive distribution or binding in tissues. The pharmacokinetics of the dacarbazine
metabolite AIC showed a longer t1/2, ranging from 0.8 to
just over 2 hours, and a delayed tmax of 0.75 to 1.5 hours
after the start of the dacarbazine infusion. This clearly
reflected the time required for metabolic conversion of
dacarbazine to AIC. The mean half-lives of dacarbazine in
women (n ¼ 2) and men (n ¼ 5) was 0.75 hours and 1.15
hours, respectively (P ¼ .51), and for AIC it was 4.63
hours for women and 1.14 hours for men (P ¼ .007).

DISCUSSION
Imexon is a novel small molecule with potentially broad
therapeutic activity based on its ability to bind thiols in tumor cells, thereby increasing the cell’s oxidative stress and
damaging mitochondria. This reduces the mitochondrial
membrane potential, which results in the leakage of cytochrome C and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.12-16 Tumor cells treated with imexon in vitro show
mitochondrial swelling, loss of mitochondrial electron
density, and the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid globules, before progression to apoptosis. In addition to this
apoptotic mechanism, imexon also induces cell cycle
arrest and inhibits the translation of hypoxia-inducing

factor 1-alpha.24 In vitro, imexon inhibited the proliferation of fresh, biopsy-collected tumor cells—including
breast, ovarian, lung, colon, and pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, and malignant melanoma cells—at concentrations of 0.2 to 10 lg/mL.16 These concentrations can
be achieved in humans.20 In vitro, imexon was synergistic
with a variety of agents, including alkylating agents such
as cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine, antimetabolites
such as gemcitabine and fluorouracil, and tubulin modulators such as docetaxel.14 With certain members of these
classes and others, such as topoisomerase 1 and 2 inhibitors, there were antagonistic effects when combined with
imexon.14
In vivo imexon inhibits the growth of a variety of
murine tumors, as well as human breast, colon, pancreatic, lung, and prostate cancer, myeloma, and melanoma
growing in the SCID mouse.13 Imexon did not have any
hepatic, renal or other organ toxicity, except for minimal
myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia, reducing the
white blood cell and platelet counts in mice, rats, and dogs
by only 25% to 50% at the maximally tolerated dose
(AmpliMed Corporation, unpublished observations). The
lack of major myelosuppression in these species and as subsequently shown in humans was because of low concentrations of radiolabeled active drug in the bone marrow
compared with other tissues (AmpliMed Corporation,
unpublished observations).
There have been 3 phase 1 studies of imexon monotherapy in humans, with various solid tumors and multiple myeloma. The MTDs were 875 mg/m2 given daily for
5 days every other week20 and 1150 mg/m2 given daily for
5 days every 3 weeks (unpublished observations). The
DLTs in these studies were fatigue and abdominal pain,
and neutropenia and hypertension, respectively. In patients
with previously treated multiple myeloma, the MTD in a

Cancer

August 1, 2010

phase 1 dose escalation study was >1300 mg/m2 when
given daily for 5 days every other week. In combination
with standard full dose gemcitabine, the MTD of imexon
was 875 mg/m2, with the DLT being transient acute abdominal pain and diarrhea at the end of the imexon infusion.18 This was shown to be a cholinergic-type effect,
partially relieved by atropine, and associated with the
finding of localization of the drug in the pancreas and
small intestine of experimental rats (AmpliMed Corporation, unpublished observations). In combination with
standard full dose docetaxel, the MTD of imexon was
1300 mg/m2, with the DLT being acute, transient, infusion-related, noncardiac chest pain.19 The combination
studies of imexon with other agents, including gemcitabine,18 docetaxel19 and now dacarbazine, have shown that
full dose imexon (as defined in the phase 1 monotherapy
studies) can be combined with a full dose of various cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, with myelosuppression
seen in the same percentage of patients as observed with
the standard drug as monotherapy. In the current study,
full dose dacarbazine alone would have been expected to
produce grade 3/4 neutropenia in 12.5%, thrombocytopenia in 4.7%, and anemia in 6.4%.2 In this combination
study of imexon plus dacarbazine, the occurrence of grade
3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia was the
same or less than expected.
In the current study, we defined the MTD of the
combination of imexon and dacarbazine as 1000 mg/m2
of imexon and 250 mg/m2 of dacarbazine, both given
daily for 5 days every 3 weeks. Thus, the starting dose of
570 mg/m2 was already 57% of what was determined to
be the MTD of the combination. The regimen was very
well tolerated, and there were only 7 serious adverse events
in 68 patients that were defined as possibly related to the
combination regimen (Table 2) by the investigators. In

3689

Original Article

the 50 subjects treated at the MTD in the phase 2 portion
of the study, the serious toxicities of the combination were
neutropenia, low hemoglobin, hypoxia, and pulmonary
edema. None was considered probably or definitely
related to the study regimen by the investigators. Subjects
were treated for as long as 13.3 months, which suggests
that there may be little cumulative or irreversible toxicity
from the treatment regimen.
The pharmacokinetics of both drugs in the current
study was similar to those previously reported. Mean
imexon peak plasma levels in the current trial were 62.0
lg/mL for a 30-minute infusion of 1000 mg/m2, compared with 97.3 lg/mL in the prior phase 1 trial of singleagent imexon.20 Clearance and volume of distribution
values were also similar in the 2 trials. The mean (standard
deviation) imexon AUC of 8947 (3639) lg/mL/min in
the prior trial, which included 1 high AUC outlier,20 is
comparable to the mean (standard deviation) imexon
AUC of 5436 (1578 lg/mL/min) seen in the 8 patients
studied in the current trial.
For dacarbazine and the AIC metabolite, the current
results are comparable to prior studies from Breithaupt
et al.22 and Rajkumar et al.23 The dacarbazine half-life
ranged from 30 to 52 minutes (mean, 41.4 minutes) in the
study by Breithaupt et al.,22 compared with 19 to 59
minutes (mean, 51.3 minutes) in the current study. The
mean peak dacarbazine plasma level of 6.1 lg/mL for a 30minute infusion of 250 mg/m2 in the current study compares to peak levels in the study by Breithaupt et al. of 6.85
lg/mL for a dose-normalized 2.65-mg/kg dose given as an
intravenous bolus.22 A novel observation in the current
results with the dacarbazine metabolite AIC is the 3-fold
longer half-life seen in the 2 female patients in the trial
(P ¼ .007). The AUCs for dacarbazine and the AIC metabolite were also greater in the 2 female patients, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ .09 each).
These results suggest that female patients may experience
greater systemic exposure to dacarbazine and especially to
the AIC metabolite compared with male patients. Overall,
the historical dacarbazine pharmacokinetic data are comparable to the current results, and this suggests there is no
impact of imexon on dacarbazine’s pharmacokinetic disposition, nor the converse. However, crossover studies
(either drug) in the same patients would technically be
required to firmly rule out a pharmacokinetic interaction.
The response and SD rates in this combination
study were consistent with those seen with dacarbazine
alone. The response rate in the phase 1 part of the study
was higher than the response rate in the phase 2 part of the

3690

study, which may relate to the small number of patients in
the study. The OS of the patients in the entire study in the
intent-to-treat population (N ¼ 68) was 11.7 months.
This is longer than that seen in prior large studies with
dacarbazine or temozolomide alone,6 and longer than that
reported in a meta-analysis of cooperative group phase 2
studies in melanoma.5 In these trials, treatment with
dacarbazine or temozolomide alone resulted in median
OS ranging approximately 6 to 8 months. However, the
small number of patients in the study simply indicates
that an adequately sized controlled clinical trial would be
of interest. In addition, patients with normal LDH levels,
who are known to have a better prognosis, had an OS of
22.5þ months with the imexon-dacarbazine combination. This is substantially longer than that seen in other
studies, where median survival was 9.7 months for this
group of patients.2
The 6-month, 1-year, and 18-month survival for all
patients in the current study were 65%, 47%, and 38%,
whereas in the dacarbazine arm of the recent phase 3
dacarbazine/oblimersen study they were approximately
65%, 32%, and 19%. The 6-month, 1-year, and
18-month survival of patients with normal LDH levels in
this study were 93%, 76%, and 62%, compared with
approximately 77%, 40%, and 22% in the dacarbazine
arm of the dacarbazine/oblimersen study.2 Again, this
indicates that a further controlled study is indicated.
The OS was favorable in this study, but interpreting
that result is difficult because of the limitations of small,
noncontrolled phase 2 studies. In addition, the subsequent
treatment of the study patients after completing this study
was not controlled and could have influenced long-term
survival. Furthermore, the imexon-dacarbazine combination did not produce a high response rate or a significant
increase in PFS. However, the survival results justify the
performance of a randomized, controlled, confirmatory
study of dacarbazine versus dacarbazine plus imexon in
stage IV melanoma patients, which is now planned. We
believe a cautious approach to a small randomized phase 2
study should be taken, as several recent studies such as the
Elesclomol trial have shown that the results of smaller trials
are often not reproduced in large randomized trials.25 In
conclusion, the combination of imexon and dacarbazine
was well tolerated. The possible effect on survival should be
followed up with a randomized phase 2 trial.
