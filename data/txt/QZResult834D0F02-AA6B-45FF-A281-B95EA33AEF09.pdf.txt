Abstract
Allergy history has been consistently inversely associated with glioma risk. Two serologic markers, soluble
CD23 (sCD23) and soluble CD14 (sCD14), are part of the innate and adaptive humoral immune systems and
modulate allergic responses in opposite directions, with sCD23 enhancing and sCD14 blunting inflammatory
responses. We measured sCD23 and sCD14 in serum from blood that was drawn at a single time point from
1,079 glioma patients postdiagnosis and 736 healthy controls. Glioma was strongly associated with high sCD14
[highest versus lowest quartile odds ratio (OR), 3.94; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.98–5.21] and low
sCD23 (lowest versus highest quartile OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.89–3.23). Results were consistent across glioma
histologic types and grades, but were strongest for glioblastoma. Whereas temozolomide treatment was not
associated with either sCD14 or sCD23 levels among cases, those taking dexamethasone had somewhat lower
sCD23 levels than those not taking dexamethasone. However, sCD23 was associated with case status regardless of dexamethasone treatment. These results augment the long-observed association between allergies and
glioma and support a role for the innate and adaptive humoral functions of the immune system, in particular
immunoregulatory proteins, in gliomagenesis. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7534–42. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The etiology of adult glioma is currently unknown. Two
recent genome-wide association studies identified five
susceptibility regions for glioma (1, 2). These are the only
definitive risk factors for glioma apart from long-established
associations with rare inherited cancer syndromes and
relatively high-dose ionizing radiation exposures (3). Most
epidemiologic studies that addressed immune factors have
reported that adults with glioma are 1.5- to 4-fold less likely
than controls to report a variety of allergies (4–6), which
ranks the absence of allergies among the most consistent risk
factors for glioma reported to date. However, mechanisms
accounting for this association have been difficult to establish. We hypothesized that allergy may reflect a state of
balance of immune functions that could influence antitumor
reactions. In one previous analysis, we found an inverse relationship between postdiagnosis serum IgE, an indicator of
atopic immune response, and glioma (7). However, in a

second study, the inverse association was only apparent in
temozolomide-treated patients and the analysis suggested
that the lower levels of IgE in the patients could be related
to temozolomide treatment (8). Although allergy-related IgE
is an evidence of adaptive humoral immune response, allergy
is a complex phenotype that involves both adaptive and
innate branches of the immune system. Recent studies have
shown clear interactions between the innate and adaptive
branches of the immune system (9, 10). Here, we focused
on two candidate serologic markers of immunoregulation
that have been implicated in allergic immune responses;
sCD23 (serum soluble CD23), the low-affinity IgE receptor,
is potentially stimulatory for atopic immunity whereas the
innate immune marker, sCD14 (serum soluble CD14), may
be inhibitory.
CD23 is an important mediator of the allergic response
and can function to enhance antigen presentation of IgE
antigen complexes (11). Soluble CD23 exhibits clear proinflammatory properties (12, 13), mediates macrophage
(14, 15) or lymphocyte (16) activation, and has been shown
to be concentrated in inflamed brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid of encephalitis patients (17).
CD14 is an important component of the innate immune
Toll-like receptor system and gram-negative and grampositive bacterial pattern recognition (18, 19). The soluble
form, sCD14, can bind to different B-cell subsets and enhance
IgG1 while suppressing IgE production (20). sCD14 inhibits
the production of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4, thus contributing to reduced IgE isotype switching (21). An example that
sCD14 plays a part in immune tolerance (22, 23) comes from
a study of farmers' children; these children, exposed to high

Serum CD14 and CD23 Levels and Glioma

levels of endotoxin and other bacterial components as
infants, have reduced risk of developing allergy and show
relatively elevated levels of sCD14 (24). Membrane-bound
CD14 is involved in Alzheimer's disease pathology (25),
and sCD14 is found in cerebrospinal fluid where it may
inhibit immune activation of glial cells and neurotoxicity
(26). This shows that CD14 is relevant to the central nervous
system.
Given the inverse relationship of glioma with allergy history
and IgE levels, the positive association of sCD23 with IgE,
and the immune tolerance role of sCD14, we evaluated the
hypotheses that glioma cases would have higher levels of
sCD14 and lower levels of sCD23 than controls.

Materials and Methods
Study participants
Population and clinic-based subject recruitment methods
for the San Francisco Bay Area Adult Glioma Study have
been described in detail elsewhere (5, 7, 8). Briefly, all cases
were adults age 20 years or older with newly diagnosed
histologically confirmed glioma (International Classification
of Disease for Oncology, morphology codes 9380–9481).
Population-based cases from six Bay Area counties were
ascertained using the Northern California Cancer Center's
rapid case ascertainment system from May 1997 to August
1999 (series 2) and from November 2001 to September 2005
(series 3). Additionally, cases with the same eligibility criteria diagnosed between 2002 and 2006 and seen at the
UCSF Neuro-oncology Clinic were eligible to participate,
regardless of place of residence; these are referred to as
clinic-based cases. Pathologic material was retrieved, when
possible, for all resected brain cancers and reviewed and
classified by one of two neuropathologists [Kenneth Aldape,
M.D. Anderson, Houston, TX, and Tarik Tihan, University of
California San Francisco (UCSF), San Francisco, CA]. Blood
and serum samples were usually collected at the time of
interview. Controls ages 20 years or older from the same
residential area as the population-based cases were identified using random-digit dialing and were frequency
matched to population-based cases on age, gender, and
ethnicity as previously described (8). Study methods were
approved by the Committee on Human Research at UCSF,
San Francisco, CA.
Interview
Interview methods for subjects, cases and controls, were
described previously (7). For population-based subjects, the
full process lasted ∼2 hours and used a structured questionnaire and show cards to facilitate recall. Allergy history data
were collected in tabular form as described in detail in our
earlier report (8). Extensive data were also collected about
family and personal medical history, including asthma and
eczema, use of prescription and nonprescription medications, demographic factors, and lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking and diet. Clinic-based patients were asked to
answer a much shorter (about 30 minutes) questionnaire,
which contained key elements of the longer questionnaire.

All participants who provided a blood sample were administered an additional questionnaire about current and recent
medications and treatments.
Measurements of sCD14 and sCD23
A single serum sample was collected and tested for each
study subject. The serologic Luminex assays were developed
using a standard sandwich capture format (27, 28). Briefly,
monoclonal antibodies to human sCD14 (clone 55-3, BD
Pharmingen) or sCD23 (clone 138633, R&D) were coupled
to carboxylated Luminex microspheres by using a two-step
carbodiimide reaction. Serum samples were diluted 1:100 in
diluent for sCD14 and 1:10 for sCD23; the serum diluent was
a mixture of PBS, 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum, and 2.5%
(vol/vol) CBS-K (Millipore Corporation). The solution was
then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour on a shaker.
A standard curve was created by diluting known concentrations of recombinant human sCD14 (Cellsciences) or sCD23
(R&D) using the standard serum diluent. The sCD14 and
sCD23 standards or participant serum samples and coupled
sCD14 or sCD23 microspheres were then incubated for
2 hours at room temperature on a shaker using a 96-well
filter-bottomed plate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) and subsequently washed with the wash buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc.). This step was followed by the addition of 25 μL of
1:1,000 diluted biotinylated anti-human sCD14 antibody
(clone 3-C39, BD Pharmingen) or anti-human sCD23 antibody (clone BAF123, R&D) to each well and then incubating
the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes on a shaker.
The serum solution was then washed and treated with 50 μL
of streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin 1:100 diluted
stock (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). After a 10-minute incubation and final wash, the microspheres were resuspended in
125 μL of assay buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The
amount of sCD14 or sCD23 bound to the microspheres by
this antibody sandwich technique was determined by the
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the reporter molecule, phycoerythrin, using the Bio-plex 200 plate reader system. The MFI of the unknown serum sample was then
converted into a picograms-per-milliliter value based on
the known concentrations of the standard curve by using a
five-parameter (5PL) regression formula. Each sample was
run with a replicate. The intraclass correlation coefficient
for sCD14 and sCD23 was 0.92 and 0.93, respectively. A single
serum sample from a person without a brain tumor was
repeated on most of the assay plates (39 of 44), and the
coefficient of variation between the assays was 11.5% for
sCD14 and 18.3% for sCD23. We performed standard addition experiments that yielded recovery rates of 94% for
sCD14 and 104% for sCD23.
IgE measurements
IgE levels were assessed using Pharmacia Diagnostics
UniCAP fluorescent “sandwich” assay as described previously
(29). IgE levels were determined using serum derived from
the same blood draw as used for the current sCD14/sCD23
analysis. Total IgE was determined by measuring fluorescence against the standard curve with known quantity

inputs. The intraclass correlation for replicate samples of IgE
was 0.99.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v9 (SAS
Institute). Odds ratios (OR) for glioma cases versus controls
were computed using unconditional logistic regression,
adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity (white/nonwhite),
education (college education yes/no), and smoking history
(ever/never) because these characteristics were possible
confounders of IgE levels and we thought that they also might
confound other serologic measures. Analyses were conducted
for all gliomas and by histologic subtype (using polytomous
logistic regression) and treatment, e.g., temozolomide-treated
versus not treated. Associations with continuous variables
were determined using standard t tests to compare means
between groups. For the case-control comparisons, sCD14
and sCD23 values were categorized into quartiles based on
the distribution among controls. In addition to analyses of
the main effects of sCD23 and sCD14 on glioma, we determined whether the association between sCD23 and glioma
was modified by level of sCD14 (or vice versa). To increase
power for these statistical interaction analyses, sCD14 was
dichotomized based on main-effect results by combining
the lowest three quartiles as the reference, whereas sCD23
was dichotomized by combining the three highest quartiles
as the reference group. sCD23 was “reverse” coded to reflect
the hypothesized inverse relationship between sCD23 and
disease status and for ease of interpretation of the statistical
interaction effects. Likelihood ratio tests were used to formally
assess statistical interaction in nested adjusted unconditional
logistic regression models with and without the cross-product
term for the grouped sCD14 and sCD23 concentrations. Total
IgE was analyzed both as a log-transformed continuous variable and for comparison with earlier studies, as a categorical
variable with groups defined based on clinically relevant
cutpoints (IgE >100 kU/L = “elevated,” 25–100 kU/L = “borderline,” and <25 kU/L = “normal”).
For any analyses involving allergy history, only populationbased subjects were included because the shorter questionnaire used for the clinic patients yielded a much lower
prevalence of ever having allergies and numbers of allergies
could not be as thoroughly quantified as it could be from the
long questionnaire.

Results
Study population
We selected 1,079 cases and 737 controls with sufficient
amounts of serum such that we would not deplete our biorepository. Serum analysis for sCD14 failed in one case and
one control, whereas, for sCD23, it failed in 15 cases and
10 controls. Therefore, a total of 1,078 cases and 736 controls
were included in the CD14 analysis and 1,064 cases and 736
controls in the sCD23 analysis. Of the 1,079 cases included in
this analysis, 671 completed the full questionnaire and 471
completed the abbreviated clinic questionnaire.

Cases and controls were comparable in their ethnicity,
college graduate and household income distributions, and
total years of education. Controls were older than cases
and more likely to be female. Controls also were more likely
to have smoked cigarettes compared with cases (Table 1).
Glioblastomas (GBM) were the most common histologic
subtype of brain tumor, followed by anaplastic astrocytomas,
astrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas (Table 1).

with high sCD14 [highest versus lowest quartile OR, 3.94; 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 2.98–5.21]. Results were consistent for both GBMs and other glioma histologies (Table 2).
In contrast, the mean serum sCD23 was lower for cases
(2.7 ± 0.08 ng/mL) compared with controls (3.6 ± 0.13 ng/mL;
P < 0.01). Glioma was strongly associated with low sCD23
(lowest versus highest quartile OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.89–3.23).
Although a similar pattern in ORs was observed for GBM
and cases with other glioma histologies, the ORs were further
from the null for those with GBM (Table 2).
Stratification of sCD14 and sCD23 levels by histologic

pronounced for GBM (Supplementary Table S1). The median
number of days between diagnosis and blood draw for cases
was 89 days. Among cases, time between diagnosis and blood
draw was weakly negatively correlated with sCD14 concentration (Spearman r2 = −0.08, P < 0.01), whereas no correlation
was observed with sCD23 concentration and time between
diagnosis and blood draw (Supplementary Table S2). We also
did not find any statistically significant association between
smoking history and sCD14 or sCD23 levels.

significant difference of sCD14 levels in the temozolomidetreated group compared with the non–temozolomide-treated
group (P = 0.6), with similar results in non-GBM patients
(P = 0.2). In stratified analyses, there also was no evidence that
history of temozolomide use altered the association of sCD14
and sCD23 with glioma (Supplementary Table S3). Glioma
was associated with higher sCD14 quartiles in both groups
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Similarly, temozolomide
not associated with sCD23 levels in glioma patients (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Temozolomide treatment schedules are typically cyclical—5 days on treatment followed
by 23 days off. We assessed whether sCD14 or sCD32 levels
were related to time since last dose of chemotherapy treatment among the 97 patients who were currently within a
28 day temozolomide cycle and found no correlation (data
not shown).
Dexamethasone treatment and sCD14 and sCD23 levels
There was no difference in means or quartile distributions
of sCD14 levels for GBM patients who reported taking dexamethasone at the time of blood draw versus those who did
not (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). In contrast, sCD23 levels in patients who reported dexamethasone use at the time
of blood draw were statistically significantly lower than in
patients who did not (Supplementary Table 5). Although
dexamethasone status did not change the pattern of association between sCD23 and glioma (see Fig. 1), the case-control
OR was lower for patients reporting dexamethasone use ver-

sus those who were not using dexamethasone (Supplementary Table S6; dexamethosone: OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17–0.36
versus non-dexamethasone: OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.39–0.73).
Apart from dexamethasone, there were no significant associations of sCD14 or sCD23 with other medications (Supplementary Tables S7a and b).
sCD14, sCD23, and IgE levels and allergy history
There were no statistically significant associations between sCD14 or sCD23 levels and IgE in controls (Supplementary Table S8). sCD23 levels in cases were lower among
those with elevated IgE but not among controls. sCD14 concentration was not related to number of allergies, allergy
type, or age at first allergy in either cases or controls (Supplementary Table S9a). However, both cases and controls
who reported any allergies had higher sCD23 levels than
those with no allergies, although the association was not statistically significant (P > 0.05; Supplementary Table S9b).
Joint association of sCD14 and sCD23 with glioma
The joint associations of sCD14 and sCD23 by histopathologic subtype and recent dexamethasone use are presented in
Table 3. Results among all cases suggested that the association between sCD23 and GBM was modified by sCD14 level.
Additional analyses conducted to assess the potential immune-related effect of dexamethasone on this relationship
showed that the suggested statistical interaction between
sCD14 and sCD23 in GBMs was limited to GBM patients

Figure 1. Analysis of joint OR of sCD23 and sCD14 in GBM patients taking or not taking dexamethasone. The patients were stratified into four groups

who had recently used dexamethasone (Table 3; Fig. 1). Results also suggested statistical interaction between sCD23
and sCD14 among non-GBM patients. Similar to GBM, it
seems that dexamethasone use may explain the observed
associations (data not shown). Small numbers of exposed
patients prohibited our ability to adequately assess the effect
of dexamethasone use on the relationship between sCD14
and sCD23 and rarer histologic subtypes. The apparent interaction was thus simply an effect of dexamethasone on sCD23
and not sCD14 and therefore not a true interaction.

Discussion
Immunologic factors have long been hypothesized to play
a role in glioma risk, and secretion of immunosuppressant
molecules by high-grade gliomas themselves is well documented (30). Despite this, there are few serum biomarkers
to evaluate the etiologic or prognostic immune aspects of
this disease. Here, we present the first analysis of the
immune regulatory proteins sCD23 and sCD14 in glioma
patients and controls showing that sCD14 levels were higher
and sCD23 levels were lower in glioma cases compared with
controls.

www.aacrjournals.org

First, we discuss sCD14 levels, which are higher in glioma cases than controls. Because measurements of sCD14
are taken after glioma diagnosis, we need to consider
whether sCD14 levels were affected by the brain tumor
or treatment. In these data, there were no differences
among glioma patients for sCD14 levels by medications,
radiation, or extent of resection. Although it is not easy
to track the details of temozolomide administration in this
study, there was no evidence that temozolomide exposure
altered the association of sCD14 or sCD23 with glioma
risk. Temozolomide may induce lymphopenia and affect
patients' levels of white blood cell subsets (31); however,
IgE levels were not altered during temozolomide treatment
schedule (8). Similarly, we found no relationship of sCD14
or sCD23 with timing of blood draw within the temozolomide treatment schedule. sCD14 levels were also not associated with a history of allergies in either cases or controls.
Alternatively, high sCD14 may reflect an individual's high
level of current bacterial antigen exposure or potentially
a greater sensitivity to this exposure (32). We had no
record of infections within our case population but note
that self-reported use of antibiotics was not associated
with sCD14. In addition, a modest increase in sCD14 with

Zhou et al.

increasing age was observed in our controls but not in
cases; age was included in all models assessing the association of sCD14 with glioma and hence was unlikely to
have influenced case-control associations. It is possible
that sCD14 levels reflect an individual's “set point” for
the capacity of the innate immune system to recognize
foreign or pathologic molecular patterns independent of
allergy, as has been suggested in other studies. Several
studies have shown that sCD14 levels are modified in the
first years of life by exposure to microbial antigens (24, 33),
leading to an adaptive and developmentally normal immune
system that may establish a permanent physiologic sCD14 set
point. Because this set point may persist later in adult life,
much as other immune factors do, it could represent a brain
tumor–susceptible phenotype or the effect of a tumor itself.
These hypotheses will have to be tested in cohort studies. It
has been suggested that sCD14 plays an immunomodulatory
role in the normal central nervous system and seems to
inhibit glial cell activation by interfering with lipopolysaccharide effects (26). In malignant brain tumors, CD14 accumulates in GBM but not among the lower-grade astrocytomas
(34). This indicates that CD14 may modulate immunologic
reactions in these tumors, contributing to their grim prognosis (34). The increased levels of sCD14 in brain tumor patients
could be generated either by shedding the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor from previously membranous CD14 or
by increased CD14 transcription without the GPI anchor
attachment (35); our data were unable to distinguish the
source of sCD14. It is also possible that brain tumors themselves increase monocyte/macrophage activity locally with
concomitant expression of CD14 and sCD14.
Although no known immunologic mechanism links sCD14
with gliomagenesis, sCD14 has the capacity to negatively
affect T-lymphocyte activation and function by interacting
directly with activated T cells. sCD14 inhibits T-cell proliferation and the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ (36). In addition,
sCD14 is known to suppress B-cell development, leading to
reduced IgE production. An antitumor role for IgE has been
proposed for solid tumors (37). Given that sCD14 has been
shown to suppress both T-cell and B-cell functions, a chronic
high level of sCD14 may predispose to a permissive immune
reaction with respect to glioma formation and participate in
the known immunosuppressive serologic factors that promote T-cell and immune anergy in the brain, including transforming growth factor-β, IL-13 decoy receptor (ILRα2), and
prostaglandin E2. Although disease or treatment-related factors might possibly affect sCD14 levels, neither temozolomide nor dexamethasone treatment seemed to influence
sCD14 levels in this study. We observed a weak negative
correlation between the time since diagnosis and blood draw.
This modest effect would in fact lead to an underestimation
of sCD14 in some cases and a lower OR of association with
glioma.
Second, we consider sCD23 levels in relation to glioma. We
found that the concentration of serum sCD23 was lower in
glioma cases compared with controls. CD23 plays a critical
role during immune response, including IgE synthesis, Band T-cell differentiation, and the secretion of inflammation

7540

mediators by various human cells (38). These mechanisms
could be important in gliomagenesis. Our group has previously shown that lack of allergy in this patient population
is a consistent risk factor for glioma. Although the relationship was not strong in our data, we observed an association of high sCD23 with increased self-reported allergy
history (Supplementary Table S9b). Thus, sCD23 may be a
useful marker of upstream immunoregulation in glioma research. Finally, we note that production of sCD23 is dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of membrane CD23 by the
metalloproteinase ADAM10. Lower amounts or activity of
ADAM10 in glioma patients could be responsible for the
decreased levels of sCD23. There are no studies of ADAM10
in human blood samples, although in glioma tissues the
levels seem to be similar to that observed in normal
brain (13, 14).
Consistent with other studies, sCD23 levels were lower in
patients using dexamethasone than in those who were not
using this glucocorticoid drug. Despite this association,
sCD23 levels were lower in glioma cases than controls, both
in patients who were and were not taking dexamethasone at
or near the time of blood draw (Fig. 1). Thus, we believe that
our results provide support for the concept that sCD23 levels
are a marker of glioma risk and not merely a marker of
glucocorticoid use.
Although we observed an interaction between sCD23 and
sCD14 levels in serum, further analyses accounting for dexamethasone use indicate that the observed interaction was
likely due to the underlying effects of dexamethasone use
on immune function. This was suggested across all histologic
subtypes. However, we have limited power to adequately
assess the effect of dexamethasone in rare histologic subtypes (specific non-GBM types). The number and activation
of B cells is known to contribute to sCD23 levels in peripheral
blood (39). If an interaction between sCD14 and sCD23 exists,
an explanation could be that high levels of sCD14 may
suppress sCD23 by inhibiting B-cell proliferation. However,
this hypothesis requires more supporting evidence and data
from glioma patients who have not yet been treated with
dexamethasone.
Although we expected to see a relationship between IgE
levels and sCD23 and sCD14, we did not observe a consistent dose-response association of sCD14 with IgE, and only
a marginal inverse association of sCD23 with IgE (Supplementary Table S9). In addition, there was no relationship
between sCD14 and allergy, but we noticed that persons
reporting allergies had higher levels of sCD23 than those
reporting no allergy for both cases and controls. This is
an interesting finding that implies that more allergies and
higher sCD23 levels may be related because both have an
inverse relationship with glioma. Another report on sCD14
in children with status asthmaticus showed that sCD14
levels were significantly higher during acute asthma attacks
than at recovery, but there was no correlation between
level of sCD14 or the change in sCD14 and the serum IgE
concentration (40). It remains unclear whether allergies
protect against tumors or whether immunosuppressive
gliomas inhibit allergies (41). The original report on IgE

Serum CD14 and CD23 Levels and Glioma

and glioma also reported that non-IgE–related allergies
were inversely related to glioma, suggesting that IgE per
se may not be on the causal pathway driving the association but, rather, some other related immune factors may be
responsible (6).
In summary, we believe that the associations of sCD23
and sCD14 with glioma are very robust and unlikely to be
due to chance because our study entailed a large sample
size that included patients with various grades and histologic types of glioma. Our epidemiologic approach allowed us
to investigate the potential role of factors such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, and treatments on
our results. We conclude that sCD14 and sCD23 measurements may provide information on how the balance of immune functions within an individual can play a role in
glioma risk.
