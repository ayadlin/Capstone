BACKGROUND. Patients with viable tumor at time of postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) are at an increased risk of disease
progression. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical variables that predict this adverse outcome.

METHODS. Between 1980 and 2003, 236 patients with testicular cancer underwent
PC-RPLND, 41 of whom (17%) were found to have viable tumor. The authors retrospectively reviewed the patients’ medical records for pertinent clinical and
treatment-related outcomes. At a median follow-up of 3.9 years, 18 patients
(44%) had developed disease recurrence and 12 patients (29%) had died of disease.

had a larger median dimension of the retroperitoneal mass (7.0 cm and 3.5 cm,
respectively; P 5 .03). The use of adjuvant chemotherapy after PC-RPLND was
.06). On multivariate analysis, patients classified as being at intermediate or poor
risk according to the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC)
had a poorer recurrence-free survival (P 5 .006 and P 5 .07, respectively). On
multivariate analysis, predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) included an
elevated a–fetoprotein (AFP) level before PC-RPLND (P 5 .003) and postoperative
disease recurrence (P 5 .02). A serum AFP level >5.3 ng/mL before PC-RPLND
was found to be predictive of a poorer DSS (P 5 .0007).

CONCLUSIONS. Patients with viable tumor at the time of PC-RPLND are at an
increased risk of disease progression. Clinical variables including classification as
intermediate or poor IGCCC risk, a preoperative serum AFP level >5.3 ng/mL,
and postoperative disease recurrence help to better define those patients who are
at risk of future adverse outcomes. Cancer 2007;110:2700–8.  2007 American

esticular cancer patients with metastatic nonseminomatous
germ cell tumors (NSGCT) traditionally have been treated with
systemic chemotherapy followed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND).1–3 The presence of viable GCT elements in the
PC-RPLND specimen places patients at an increased risk of disease
progression and death.4,5 Nevertheless, a small proportion of
patients with viable tumor in the surgical specimen fail to develop
disease progression regardless of whether they receive additional
therapy.6 The ability to better define the clinical features predictive
of disease progression in these patients would allow clinicians to

tailor adjuvant chemotherapy strategies and surveillance protocols appropriately. The aim of the current
study was to review our disease-related outcomes in
patients found to have viable GCT at the time of PCRPLND and determine whether clinical parameters
allow us to better define those patients who are at an
increased risk of subsequent disease progression and
death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
A retrospective chart review protocol was approved
by our Institutional Review Board before the initiation of this study. From our tumor registry, we identified 236 patients who underwent a PC-RPLND
between January 1980 and July 2003 for NSGCT. We
excluded patients with fibrosis (n 5 97 patients) or
teratoma (n 5 98 patients) in the PC-RPLND specimen, with our study population comprised of the 41
patients found to have viable GCT in the surgical
specimen. At the time of diagnosis of testicular cancer, all patients underwent a complete medical evaluation, including serum tumor markers and
radiologic imaging comprised of chest and abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans. Clinical
and pathologic staging was determined using the
1997 TNM staging system. Furthermore, patients
were categorized into 3 prognostic groups (good-risk,
intermediate-risk, and poor-risk) according to the
1997 International Germ Cell Consensus Classification (IGCCC) guidelines.7 IGCCC risk categories
could be assigned to 36 patients; the remaining 5
patients could not be assigned to any risk group
because of missing information regarding their serum tumor markers at the time of diagnosis. Pathologic specimens, including the testicular primary
neoplasm and other surgically resected specimens,
were reviewed by several of our genitourinary pathologists.
All patients received systemic chemotherapy
before PC-RPLND, with the mean and median number of chemotherapy cycles being 6.3 cycles and 5
cycles, respectively. The specific chemotherapeutic
regimen selected was decided on an individual basis
by the treating genitourinary medical oncologist.
Patients were administered or switched from a firstline to a second-line chemotherapeutic regimen if
they had either persistent serum tumor marker elevation and/or a minimal radiographic response to systemic chemotherapy. In addition, all patients
undergoing ‘‘desperation’’ PC-RPLND (ie, PC–RPLND
performed in the context of elevated preoperative serum tumor markers, which has been defined pre-

2701

viously8 as an AFP level >15.0 ng/mL and/or beta
human chorionic gonadotropin [BHCG] >2.2 mIU/
mL) and who had received second-line or additional
salvage chemotherapy before surgery were deemed
to have received the maximum tolerable dose of preoperative chemotherapy. There has been a historical
change in our chemotherapeutic regimens for
patients with testicular cancer over the past 25 years.
Typically in the 1980s, we administered alternating
cycles of the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CISCA) and that of vinblastine and bleomycin (VB) and gave 2 cycles beyond
normalization of serum tumor markers for all
patients with NSGCT regardless of their clinical stage,
with a minimum of 4 cycles administered.9,10 In the
1990s, we continued administering alternating CISCA
and VB regimens, with a 20% dose reduction but
with equivalent survival rates.11 In patients with
high-volume disease, we administered alternating
dose-dense chemotherapy.12 Before 1997, patients
with small-volume disease received the combination
of carboplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (CEB)13;
however, in recent years, 3 cycles of the bleomycin,
etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) regimen or 4 cycles of
the etoposide and cisplatin (EP) combination were
given to good-risk NSGCT patients. After PC-RPLND,
patients were followed routinely by history, physical
examination, and serum tumor markers, as well as
chest and abdominal/pelvic CT scans every 3 months
(or earlier if so desired by the treating genitourinary
medical or urologic oncologist).

Statistical Analysis
Forty-one patients were included in the statistical
analysis, with the median values reported for age at
diagnosis, serum tumor markers prior to orchiectomy
and before PC-RPLND, the number of chemotherapy
cycles before surgery, the largest dimension of the
retroperitoneal mass noted on radiologic CT scan,
the largest dimension of the retroperitoneal mass
noted on pathology, and the number of lymph nodes
removed. Frequency distributions are reported for
the clinical stage and histology of the testicular primary tumor, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and the clinical stage of testicular cancer.
Baseline patient characteristics were compared
between the group of patients with viable tumor
noted in the PC-RPLND specimen with subsequent
disease recurrences versus those without disease
recurrences using either the Wilcoxon rank sum test,
Fisher exact test, or Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test.
The methods of Kaplan and Meier14 were used to
estimate the median recurrence-free survival (RFS)
and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates. For the

2702

CANCER

analysis of RFS, disease recurrence was counted as
an event and for the analysis of DSS, disease-specific
death was the only event noted. Patients who survived were censored at the date of their last followup. Patients defined as dead of other causes had no
evidence of recurrence of the testicular cancer at the
time of their last follow-up visit and were censored
at their date of death. The number of patients at risk
and survival rates at 0, 5, and 10 years were assessed
for both DSS and RFS.
Using the Cox proportional hazards regression
model,15 we tested the statistical significance of several potential prognostic factors for predicting RFS
and DSS. This modeling was performed in a univariate fashion. From this model, we estimated the
hazards ratio (HR) for each potential prognostic factor with a 95% confidence interval. All potential
prognostic factors with a P value <.10 from the univariate analysis were then included in a saturated
model, and backward elimination was used to
remove variables from the model based on the likelihood ratio test in the multiple regression analysis.
The type of chemotherapeutic regimen used was not
included as a variable in our univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models of
DSS and RFS because >10 different chemotherapeutic regimens were used at our institution over the
23–year period of this study, making it difficult to
compare the treatment-related outcomes of these
various treatment regimens. A serum AFP value of
5.3 ng/mL before PC-RPLND was chosen as a specific cutoff point because this numeric value of AFP
represents the 75% quartile of AFP values and was
found to be most optimal in differentiating DSS
among our study population. The mean and median
length of follow-up for our study population from
the time of PC-RPLND was 5.2 years and 3.9 years,
respectively (range, 0.5–19.4 years). All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS software (version
9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), setting the statistical
significance level at P < .05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The clinical characteristics of our study population
are shown in Table 1. The median age of patients
before orchiectomy was 27.0 years (range, 16.6–51.5
years) and the median serum tumor values were an
AFP level of 235.0 ng/mL, BHCG level of 21.6 mIU/
mL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 452
IU/L. The pathologic stage of the primary tumor was
pT1 in the majority of cases (73.2%), with lymphovascular invasion reported in 17.1% of patients. The

most common primary tumor histology was mixed
NSGCT (85.3%). The clinical stage of testicular cancer was stage IIA in 1 patient (2.4%), stage IIB in 12
patients (29.3%), stage IIC in 20 patients (48.8%), and
stage III in 8 patients (19.5%). The median of the largest dimension of the retroperitoneal masses as
measured on preoperative radiologic imaging was
3.0 cm (range, 1–17 cm). Patients received a median
of 5 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy before PCRPLND, with the median serum tumor marker values
before PC-RPLND being 3.3 ng/mL for AFP, 1.0 mIU/
mL for BHCG, and 457.0 IU/L for LDH. PC-RPLND
was performed in 25 patients after first-line chemotherapy and in 8 patients after second-line chemotherapy; the remaining 8 patients underwent
‘‘desperation’’ PC-RPLND. All patients underwent a
full-bilateral template RPLND, with a median of 18
lymph nodes removed per case. All patients were
deemed to have undergone a complete surgical
resection at the time of PC-RPLND, with 3 patients
undergoing additional procedures at the time of surgery (nephrectomies in 2 patients and an aortic graft
in 1 patient). Our overall postoperative complication
rate (occurring <1 month from the date of PCRPLND) was 32%, with the major complications
being chylous ascites (n 5 4 patients), ileus (n 5 3
patients), and atelectasis (n 5 3 patients). In addition, there was 1 postoperative death that occurred
secondary to sepsis.
All the patients in the current study had viable
GCT elements, with the histology consisting of mixed
NSGCT in 36 patients (87.8%), embryonal carcinoma
in 3 patients (7.3%), and yolk sac tumor in 2 patients
(4.9%). Thirty-six of the 41 patients received adjuvant
chemotherapy after PC-RPLND.
Of all patients (N 5 236) treated with PC-RPLND
at our center over the study period, the incidence of
viable cancer at time of PC-RPLND has dramatically
declined (P 5 .02) from 34.6% in the 1980s to 18.0%
in more recent years (1990–2003).

Survival Analysis
All 41 patients with viable GCT elements in the surgical specimen were included in our survival analysis,
with 25 patients still alive, 12 dead of disease, and 4
dead of other causes at the time of analysis. Eighteen
of the 41 patients in the current study experienced a
postoperative disease recurrence, with the median
RFS being 3.0 years. The 5-year DSS and RFS rates
were 71% and 50%, respectively, with the 10-year
DSS and RFS rates being 66% and 50%, respectively.
The Kaplan-Meier DSS and RFS analyses are shown
in Figure 1.

Of the 41 patients with viable tumor noted in the
PC-RPLND specimen, 18 (44%) developed disease recurrence after surgery. The clinical characteristics of
patients with or without disease recurrences after
PC-RPLND were contrasted as shown in Table 2. The
group of patients with viable tumor in the PCRPLND specimen who developed a disease recurrence had a larger median dimension of the retroperitoneal mass (7.0 cm and 3.5 cm, respectively; P 5
.03). Furthermore, all patients developing postoperative disease recurrence had received adjuvant chemotherapy, and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy
after PC-RPLND was more common than in those
patients who did not develop postoperative disease

not develop postoperative disease recurrence despite
not receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy
had normalized preoperative and postoperative serum
tumor markers and had focal, viable GCT elements in
the PC-RPLND specimen (2 positive lymph nodes).
We did not note a significant difference between these
2 groups in terms of age at diagnosis, serum tumor
markers before orchiectomy or before PC-RPLND,
stage of the primary testicular tumor, histology of the
testicular neoplasm, the presence of lymphovascular
invasion in the primary tumor, the amount of preoperative chemotherapy administered, clinical stage of
the disease, and pathology of the PC-RPLND specimen. There was no statistically significant difference

(P 5 .78) noted in the median durations of follow-up
between the group of patients with and those without
disease recurrence.

Predictors of RFS, DSS, and Overall Survival
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
analyses of potential predictors of RFS are shown in
Table 3. On multivariate analysis, patients classified
as being at intermediate or poor risk according to
IGCCC criteria were found to have a worse RFS (P 5
.006 and P 5 .07, respectively). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses of potential predictors of DSS are shown in Table 4. On
multivariate analysis, an elevated serum AFP before

operative disease recurrence (P 5 .02) were found to
be predictive of poorer DSS. The presence of a serum
AFP level >5.3 ng/mL before PC-RPLND was predictive of poorer DSS, as shown in Figure 2. There were
9 patients with a preoperative serum AFP level >5.3
ng/mL, with all of these patients having significantly
higher serum AFP levels (median of 6279 ng/mL)
before orchiectomy. A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
contrasting the DSS of patients with or without post-

operative recurrences demonstrated the prognostic
impact of this variable (P 5 .02) (Fig. 3). On multivariate analysis of predictors of overall survival, advanced
clinical stage of the primary tumor (T2 or higher; P 5
.01), an elevated serum AFP before PC-RPLND (P 5
.05), an increased amount of preoperative chemotherapy (> 5 cycles; P 5 .002), and the development of a
postoperative complication (P 5 .03) were all found to
be associated with a poorer overall survival.

DISCUSSION
Patients with viable tumor in the PC-RPLND specimen are at high-risk of disease progression despite
the majority of these patients receiving adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.4,6 In the current study, we

report a disease recurrence rate of 44% and a disease-specific mortality rate of 29% at a median follow-up of 3.9 years. Nevertheless, a select subgroup
of patients with viable GCT in the surgical specimen
did not develop disease progression. Thus, the ability

lymph node dissection.

to predict those patients at risk of disease progression would allow us to tailor surveillance protocols
and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy regimens
appropriately. In the current study, patients diagnosed with intermediate–risk or poor-risk disease
according to the IGCCC criteria were found to have a
poorer RFS. In addition, a serum AFP level >5.3 ng/
mL before PC-RPLND and the development of a
postoperative disease recurrence are predictive of a
poorer DSS in this patient population. The prognostic
significance of preoperative serum tumor markers has
been shown previously3,8 and cannot be overemphasized. Patients should be offered adequate preoperative systemic chemotherapy until the normalization of
serum tumor markers is achieved. Although there is a
subset of patients in whom preoperative serum tumor
marker elevation may result from other causes (eg,
hypogonadism, hepatotoxicity, and illicit drug use),
for the most part preoperative serum tumor marker
elevation should be assumed to result from viable
GCT elements and such patients should be offered
additional systemic chemotherapy until normalization
of tumor markers occurs or until maximum tolerable
amounts of chemotherapy are administered. A multidisciplinary approach to such patients may be beneficial because insight from both medical and surgical
oncologists is provided. The prognostic factors identified in patients with viable GCT at the time of PCRPLND are clinically useful to the treating urologist
and genitourinary oncologist.
In our comparison of the clinical variables of the
patients with and those without disease recurrence,
we observed that the median size of the retroperitoneal masses after surgical resection was significantly
larger in the group of patients with viable GCT who
developed disease recurrence. Furthermore, the use

of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was higher in
the group of patients who developed a disease recurrence, illustrating that as physicians we may have a
sense of who may be at risk of disease progression
among those patients with viable tumor in the surgical specimen. This point is clearly illustrated by the
fact 5 patients were not offered adjuvant chemotherapy and did not develop a postoperative disease recurrence due to the fact that they had a low volume
of viable disease in the PC-RPLND specimen (2
positive lymph nodes) and they had normalized preoperative and postoperative serum tumor markers.
However, the heterogeneity of our study population
is an alternate explanation for why we noted fewer
disease recurrences in patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, our analysis is limited by the small number of patients in this subset
and we hope future studies may help to further clarify the prognosis and necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with a low volume of viable
disease at the time of PC-RPLND.
In our patient population, we noted that the
incidence of viable GCT at the time of PC-RPLND
has declined nearly 2-fold (from 34.6% to 18%) from
the 1980s until more recently (1990–2003), which we
speculate may be the result of more effective preoperative chemotherapeutic regimens.
A comparison of the baseline characteristics (eg,
serum tumor markers before PC-RPLND, IGCCC risk
categories, and clinical tumor stage) of the patient
population in the current study was made with those
of patients in our testicular cancer database who
were found to have fibrosis alone (n 5 97 patients)
in the surgical specimen (data not presented). We
found no statistically significant differences in terms
of any of their baseline patient characteristics.

In our multivariate analysis of predictors of DSS,
an elevated serum AFP before PC-RPLND was associated with a poorer DSS, which is consistent with
prior studies.4 We were able to identify a specific
value for the serum AFP level of >5.3 ng/mL before
PC-RPLND as being associated with a poorer DSS. It
is somewhat surprising that an elevated serum AFP
level was predictive of DSS and not RFS, for which
we do not have a clear explanation. In addition,
patients with viable tumor at the time of PC-RPLND
in whom a postoperative disease recurrence developed were found to have a nearly 15-fold higher risk
of dying of disease than patients without disease recurrence, which strongly supports the need for an
aggressive treatment approach to postoperative
recurrences. On multivariate analysis, patients classified as being at intermediate or poor risk according
to the IGCCC criteria have a poorer RFS, further validating the important prognostic value of this classification system. However, we were quite surprised that
patients with intermediate-risk disease had a higher
HR of disease recurrence than those with poor-risk
disease (HRs of 9.4 and 3.5, respectively), which we
attributed to the small number of patients included
in this analysis (particularly in the intermediate-risk
group). Nevertheless, the clinical parameters identified in this study may help guide the need for adjuvant therapy and the stringency of surveillance.
The limitations of the current study must be
addressed. First, our study is retrospective and chemotherapeutic regimens have evolved at our center
over the past 20 years, which may have affected our
treatment outcomes. Second, the surgical pathology
data we reported consisted of data derived from our
review and/or the interpretation of pathology reports.
Consequently, pathology specimens were reported by
different genitourinary pathologists at our institution,
each of whom may have interpreted the pathologic
specimens slightly differently.
In conclusion, the current study defines the disease-related outcomes and predictors of disease progression in patients with viable GCT in the PCRPLND specimen. Patients with viable tumor at the
time of surgery are at a high risk of disease recurrence (44%); nevertheless, a subgroup of these
patients will not develop disease progression. The
clinical parameters that help to better define those
patients at risk of such adverse outcomes were a preoperative serum AFP level of >5.3 ng/mL and postoperative disease recurrence. Recognition of these
important predictors of outcome may facilitate our
management of and follow-up protocols for patients
with viable GCT in their PC-RPLND specimens,

although we await validation of our findings at other
centers.
