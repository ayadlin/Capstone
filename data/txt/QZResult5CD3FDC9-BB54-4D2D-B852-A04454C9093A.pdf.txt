Abstract
The cell surface protease membrane-type serine protease-1 (MT-SP1), also known as matriptase, is often upregulated in epithelial cancers. We hypothesized that dysregulation of MT-SP1 with regard to its cognate inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1), a situation that increases proteolytic activity, might be exploited for
imaging purposes to differentiate malignant from normal tissue. In this study, we show that MT-SP1 is active on
cancer cells and that its activity may be targeted in vivo for tumor detection. A proteolytic activity assay with several
MT-SP1–positive human cancer cell lines showed that MT-SP1 antibodies that inhibit recombinant enzyme activity
in vitro also bind and inhibit the full-length enzyme expressed on cells. In contrast, in the same assay, MT-SP1–
negative cancer cell lines were inactive. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the cell surface localization of labeled
antibodies bound to MT-SP1–positive cells. To evaluate in vivo targeting capability, 0.7 to 2 nmoles of fluorescently labeled antibodies were administered to mice bearing tumors that were positive or negative for MT-SP1.
Antibodies localized to MT-SP1–positive tumors (n = 3), permitting visualization of MT-SP1 activity, whereas
MT-SP1–negative tumors (n = 2) were not visualized. Our findings define MT-SP1 activity as a useful biomarker
to visualize epithelial cancers using a noninvasive antibody-based method. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1505–12. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Molecular imaging of cancer has the potential to facilitate
early detection and to provide a more detailed assessment of
disease. Currently, there are fewer than 10 imaging probes
approved for use in the clinic, and they are often limited in
use (1). Unfortunately, a lack of specificity and/or sensitivity
limits most of these probes for use in evaluating patients
with previously diagnosed cancers, and the majority are useful only in a small subset of cancers. Therefore, the search for
new biomarker molecules, and for imaging probes with
which to detect them, continues.
Proteases are a class of enzymes that shows promise for
cancer detection and characterization. Proteolytic processing is necessary in nearly every stage of cancer growth
and progression, from angiogenesis to extracellular matrix
remodeling, cell-to-cell signaling, and metastasis (2–5). Finely
regulated through activation and inhibition, changes in relative levels of proteases or their cognate inhibitors are often associated with cancer, suggesting that it is a dysregulation of
proteolysis that contributes to malignant growth (4, 6).

Membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1), also referred
to as matriptase, prostamin, TADG-15, PRSS14, SNC19, and
ST14, is a cell surface protease that, along with its cognate
inhibitor hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1
(HAI-1), is dysregulated in a number of epithelial cancers.
This dysregulation has been correlated to cancer stage, and
the downregulation of inhibitors indicates that MT-SP1 is
likely more active in the disease state (7–20). MT-SP1 has
been shown to cleave a number of cancer-promoting substrates and has recently been associated with a prometastasic signaling pathway in breast cancer; however, its exact role
in cancer has not been precisely defined (21–23). The ability
to noninvasively monitor active MT-SP1 throughout disease
progression would be useful for a better understanding of the
role of MT-SP1 in tumor development and as a method for
tumor detection.
The use of fluorescently labeled substrate-based probes
in mouse models has confirmed that proteolytic activity is
a viable marker for cancer imaging in vivo (24–27). Antibodies provide an alternate approach for targeting biomarkers and have the advantage of being very potent and
specific for the target protease. Pharmacokinetics may also
be altered by building the epitope recognition region into
antibody-derived structures such as single chain variable
fragments (scFv), Fabs, or minibodies. Human antibodies
are also nonimmunogenic and can be functionalized for
multiple imaging modalities. Accordingly, many antibodyderived tools for cancer detection and treatment are already Food and Drug Administration approved for in vivo
use (1, 28).
MT-SP1, anchored to the extracellular surface of cancer
cells, is localized to malignant tissue and accessible to antibodies, making it an ideal candidate for targeting in vivo.
Phage display was used to isolate two antibodies that are

selective for the active form of MT-SP1 and to inhibit the
protease. Kinetic assays with a number of closely related
proteases showed no measurable inhibition, indicating that
these antibodies are also very selective for this enzyme (29,
30).5 Here, we show that MT-SP1 is active and can be inhibited on the surface of human cancer cells. Antibodies are
then fluorescently labeled and used as probes for MT-SP1 activity in xenograft mice, ultimately showing that MT-SP1 is
active at the tumor site and that this activity may be used
for noninvasive tumor detection.

Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification
E2 scFv and Fab and A11 Fab were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (29, 31). Diabody was synthesized by complete deletion of the
polyglycine linker region of the scFv, using the following primers (Eurofins MWG Operon): forward primer 5′GGCCAAGGCACCCTGGTGACGGTTAGCTCAGCGGATATCGTGATGACCCAGAGC CCACTGAGCCTGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCAGGCTCAGTGGGCTCTGGGTCATCAC
GATATCCGCTGAGCTAACCGTCACCAGGGTGCCTTGGCC3′. The scFv expression vector was purified from E. coli using
Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and subjected to PCR with primers, using reagents from Stratagene QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies)—1 cycle at 97°C for 60 s, 20 cycles of 97°C for 60 s,
55°C for 80 s, 68°C for 5 min, and 1 cycle of 68°C for 12 min.
The PCR product was sequenced to confirm deletion, retransformed into DH12S cells, and expressed in the same
way as scFv. The KI of the diabody was calculated as described below and found to be about twice that of the scFv.
MT-SP1 and the inactive zymogen mutant R15A were expressed in E. coli and purified as described (29, 31). A11
IgG was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the
V genes from the selected A11 Fab clone and an IgG expression vector as previously described (32).
Kinetics of Inhibition
The KI for A11 IgG and E2 diabody were determined as
previously described (30). The antibody was incubated with
recombinant MT-SP1 for 4 h, and proteolysis was measured
through activation of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme tPA (America Diagnostica, Inc.). A11 concentration
was varied from 0 to 250 nmol/L, E2 diabody was varied
from 3 to 250 pmol/L, and Spectrozyme concentration
was varied from 0 to 1 mmol/L. The KI* value for each concentration of substrate was determined by fitting the data
to the equation

Fluorescent Labeling of Protein
scFv, diabody, Fab, and IgG were labeled with AlexaFluor
594 (for microscopy) or AlexaFluor 680 (for in vivo imaging;
Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein
was purified from unreacted dye on a Superdex 75 fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare). Degree
of labeling was determined using UV/Vis spectrometry as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. In fluorescence experiments, concentrations given refer to dye molecules rather
than the labeled protein.
Surface Plasmon Resonance
Binding curves were obtained as previously described,
with the following modifications: the A11 Fab immobilization level was ∼70 RU, and MT-SP1 and the inactive zymogen MT-SP1 R15A was injected in concentrations from
50 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L at 20 μL/min to minimize mass
transfer effects (31). Surface regenerations were performed
with 100 mmol/L glycine (pH 2.2), allowing a complete return to baseline. The sensorgram of the reference surface
was subtracted from the ligand-conjugated surface for each
injection.
Cell Culture
Human cancer cell lines HT-29, PC-3, MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, HT1080, and COLO 320DM and
LNCaP were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in the recommended medium for
less than 6 mo after receipt or resuscitation. MCF-7/Luc+
and MDA-MB-231/Luc+ cells were modified by lentiviral
transduction to express Firefly luciferase as previously described (33, 34).
Activity assays. T-75 flasks of 70% to 90% confluent adherent cells were rinsed in PBS and lifted using Enzyme-Free
Cell Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen). Cells were washed
twice in serum-free medium and counted, then resuspended
in serum-free medium and aliquoted into round-bottomed
96-well plates, ranging from 30,000 to 60,000 cells per well,
depending on the cell line. E2 Fab and serum-free medium
were added for a final volume of 95 μL and final inhibitor
concentration of 200 nmol/L. For total inhibition, 5 μL of
25× Complete Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), a broad-spectrum
protease inhibitor cocktail, in water were added along with
90 μL of serum-free medium. After 1- to 1.5-h incubation
at 37°C, 5% CO2, Spectrofluor-tPA (American Diagnostica,
Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 500 μmol/L. Fluorescence was measured on a SpectraMax Gemini EM plate
reader (MDS, Inc.) with excitation/emission wavelengths of
380/460 nm. Fluorescence was measured for 1 h or until proteolysis ceased to be linear. Fluorescence was also measured

of MT-SP1 (black) and the zymogen-like mutant R15A (gray) to
the A11 Fab show robust binding to active enzyme and a lack of binding

in wells containing only 100 μL of serum-free medium to correct for nonproteolytically mediated substrate hydrolysis. Before inhibition assays, these experiments were carried out
with 10,000 to 100,000 cells per well to ensure that the number of cells used was in the range in which fluorescence increased linearly with cell number. Activity assays were
conducted in sextuplicate.
Fluorescence imaging. Glass microscope coverslips were
flame-sterilized and placed in 12-well plates. Cells were passaged into these wells and grown to a confluency of 40% to
90%. Twelve to 16 h before imaging, cells were switched to
serum-free medium. One hour before imaging, fresh serumfree medium was added with enough AlexaFluor 594–labeled
E2 scFv to obtain a final fluorphore concentration of 300
nmol/L. Cells were returned to the incubator for 1 to 1.5 h,
after which slides were removed, rinsed in PBS, and immediately imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope outfitted with a G-2E/C filter combination (Nikon).
All cells were imaged within 10 min of removal from the incubator. For the HAI-1 blocking experiment, recombinant
human HAI-1 (R&D Systems) was diluted to 1 μmol/L in
PBS and added along with fresh serum-free medium to a final
concentration of 200 nmol/L, and cells were incubated under
normal conditions for 3 h. At this time, fluorescently labeled
E2 scFv was added to the blocked cells, as well as to unblocked
cells, for a final dye concentration of 100 nmol/L. Cells were
incubated for another hour and then rinsed in PBS and imaged. Images were collected in the .zvi format with a Zeiss Axiocam using Axiovision Software (Carl Zeiss). Images were
converted to jpegs and corrected for camera condensation artifacts, as determined by blank (no cell) images and by using
Adobe Photoshop software (Supplementary Data Fig. S1).
Mouse Xenograft Generation
MCF-7 and MCF-7/Luc+ (s.c. implantations). Six- to 7-wkold female nude (NCR nu/nu athymic female mice, 6–7 wk
old; Taconic Farms) were s.c. implanted at the base of tail
with 60-d sustained release 0.72 mg 17h-estradiol pellets (In-

novative Research of America, Inc.). Two days later, 1 × 107
MCF-7 or MCF-7/Luc+ breast cancer cells were implanted
s.c. in the upper back area as a 0.2-mL suspension. Tumor
growth was measured by caliper along the largest (length)
and smallest (width) axes twice a week. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the following formula (20): tumor volume =
[(length) × (width) × (width)] / 2. At ∼30 d after tumor implantation (mean tumor volume, 600 mm3), animals were imaged as described below.
MDA-MB-231 (mammary fat pad implantation). Six- to
7-wk-old female nude (NCR nu/nu athymic female mice, 6–7 wk
old; Taconic Farms) were anesthetized with avertin. A midline
incision along the abdomen followed by angled bilateral incision between the number 4 and 5 nipples was then made to expose the number 4 mammary gland. MDA-MB-231/Luc+ cells
(2 × 105 cells suspended in 40 μL serum-free medium) were injected directly into the surgically exposed mammary fat pads
with a 500 μL tuberculin syringe. The abdominal skin flaps were
closed with wound clips. Wound clips were removed 14 d postsurgery. At ∼45 d after tumor implantation (mean tumor volume, 400 mm3), animals were imaged as described below.
Fluorescence Imaging of Mice
Mice were fed an alfalfa-free diet of Harlan Teklad Global
2018 rodent feed to minimize background fluorescence. Mice
were anesthetized with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane. AlexaFluor
680–labeled A11 IgG, E2 Fab, and E2 diabody were injected
to the tail veins, with the total amount of injected dye ranging from 0.5 to 2 nmoles. For fluorescence imaging of mice
with E2 diabody and Fab, two MCF-7 mice were each injected with ∼2 nmoles of dye (Fab) and ∼3 nmoles of dye
(diabody). Images were collected in fluorescent mode on
an IVIS 50 using Living Image 2.50.2 software (Caliper Life
Sciences) at set intervals depending on the antibody construct injected. For IgG studies, two MCF-7 and one MCF-7/
Luc+ mice were injected with ∼2 nmoles of dye and anesthetized and imaged at regular intervals for 50 h. Two MDA-MB231/Luc+ tumor-bearing mice were injected with ∼0.7 to 1
nmoles of dye and imaged in the same manner. All dye was
administered in total injection volume equal to 100–300 microliters. In the images presented, region of interest analysis
of the entire mouse using Living Image software indicated
the relative signal coming from each mouse 4 h after injection.
Intensity minima and maxima of each set of the presented
images were adjusted to compensate for the difference in total
signal from the two sets of mice. For bioluminescent images,
Luc+ mice were anesthetized as described and i.v. injected
with ∼1 mg of luciferase and imaged in bioluminescent mode
on the IVIS 50 with Living Image software at 12 to 15 min postinjection. All in vivo studies were performed as directed under
institutional approval.

Results
Antibodies are selective for active MT-SP1. We have developed two antibodies, E2 and A11, that exclusively bind to
the active form of MT-SP1 with picomolar affinity (29, 30). As

was shown for E2, we show here that the A11 Fab is selective
for active MT-SP1 (Fig. 1; ref. 31). Mutating the arginine residue necessary for MT-SP1 autoactivation generates the
inactive zymogen MT-SP1 R15A. Whereas binding of active
MT-SP1 can be seen at 200 nmol/L, no binding was observed
for MT-SP1 R15A at concentrations up to 1 μmol/L, demonstrating selectivity for the active enzyme.
Because they are both selective for active enzyme and
share similar mechanisms of inhibition and potencies against
MT-SP1, E2 and A11 are used interchangeably in these
experiments, as summarized in Table 1. Although multiple
antibody-based constructs are used—scFv, Fab, or IgG—they
will be referred to throughout as “antibodies,” with the specific construct noted in Materials and Methods.
Inhibition of MT-SP1 in cell culture. Although the antibodies inhibit the catalytic domain of MT-SP1, it has not
been shown that the full-length enzyme is active and can
be inhibited by the antibodies on human cells. An assay
was developed to address this by monitoring whole cell–
associated proteolysis. In this assay, the P1-Arg–specific
substrate Spectrofluor-tPA was added to cells in serum-free
medium, and proteolysis was measured over time. When the
MT-SP1–specific (α-MT-SP1) antibodies were added to these
cells, any decrease in the rate of proteolysis could be attributed
to this particular enzyme, confirming that MT-SP1 is active and that the antibodies inhibit the full-length protease.
Figure 2 shows the results of this assay as performed with
seven different human cancer cells, chosen based on previously published mRNA expression data (35). The MT-SP1–
positive cells showed a 42% to 89% decrease in proteolysis
of the P1-Arg substrate on the addition of MT-SP1–specific
antibody-based inhibitors, whereas the MT-SP1–negative
cells showed no significant decrease in activity. Additionally,
the proteolysis was completely inhibited in the presence of a
broad spectrum inhibitor cocktail in all cell lines. This assay
shows two key points: first, that uninhibited, active MT-SP1
is present on the surface of these cancer cells and, second,
that our antibodies are able to bind and inhibit the fulllength protease.
Ex vivo labeling of MT-SP1. For an antibody to be useful
as a probe for molecular imaging of MT-SP1 activity, it must
be efficiently labeled without destroying its ability to bind to
the enzyme. For fluorescence detection, commercially available dye–succinimidyl ester conjugates were used to nonspecifically label the antibodies through accessible lysines. Based
on structural data of both A11 and E2 Fabs bound to recombinant MT-SP1, the labeling of free lysines should not interfere with enzyme binding (Supplementary Data Fig. S2).

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

Depending on the construct—scFv, diabody, Fab, or IgG—
we were able to conjugate an average of one to six dye
molecules per protein. Inhibition assays with recombinant
protein showed minor (0- to 5-fold) increases in IC50 values,
and given the high potency of these inhibitors, such an increase was not considered a significant barrier to antibody
binding. To test the functionality of the scFv against fulllength protein, human cancer cells were incubated with the
labeled MT-SP1 antibodies and fluorescently imaged to look
for association with the membranes of these cells (Fig. 3).
Three MT-SP1–positive cell lines—HT-29, MCF-7, and
LNCaP—show labeling with the fluorescent antibodies,
whereas the negative control lines MDA-MB-231 and COLO
320DM do not. Interesting to note is the difference in the
nature of this labeling; the HT-29 signal appears to come
evenly from the membrane of the cell whereas the signal
on LNCaP and MCF-7 cells is more punctate. Whether this
is a result of MT-SP1 congregating on the surface or an internalization of the antibody/enzyme complex has not been
determined. Nevertheless, these results show that these labeled antibodies serve as imaging probes to selectively target
MT-SP1–positive cells ex vivo.

Figure 2. MT-SP1–specific inhibitors reduce cell-associated proteolysis
of a fluorescent P1-arginine protease substrate. Spectrofluor-tPA was
added to seven human cancer cell lines with and without α-MT-SP1 Fab.
Because the inhibitors are specific, any reduction in proteolysis can be
attributed to an inhibition of active MT-SP1. Black bars represent total
P1-Arg proteolytic activity of uninhibited cells, whereas gray bars show
the activity of cells incubated with α-MT-SP1 Fab. Cell lines that express
MT-SP1 mRNA—MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, HT29, and LNCaP—show a
reduction in proteolysis on the addition of antibody inhibitor, whereas the
MT-SP1–negative cell lines MDA-MB-231, HT1080, and COLO 320DM
do not. RFU, relative fluorescence units.

Targeting Proteolysis for Tumor Detection

localizes to MT-SP1–positive cells in cell
culture. A, HT-29, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells
express MT-SP1 mRNA, whereas
MDA-MD-231 and COLO 320DM cells (B) do
not. Antibodies do not significantly displace
HAI-1. HT-29 cells that have been incubated
with recombinant HAI-1 (C) show much less
surface labeling on exposure to fluorescently
labeled scFv than those that have not been
blocked (D). Scale bar, 50 μm. Images were
corrected as described in Supplementary
materials.

MT-SP1 is putatively present on the surface of epithelial
cells in at least three different forms—the inactive zymogen,
active protease, and HAI-1–inhibited protease. Our experimental results indicate that the antibodies are binding to
and inhibiting active protease on the cell surface; however,
the question remains whether the antibody is displacing cognate inhibitor on binding. In this case, the signal would not
be representative of free, active protease on the cell surface.
A study of the rat homologues of MT-SP1 and HAI-1 observed picomolar inhibition, and MT-SP1, which has been
shed from the cell surface, is found only in complex with
its cognate inhibitor, suggesting extremely tight binding
in vivo (36). To test for HAI-1 displacement by these antibodies, the immunofluorescence cell labeling was carried out
with HT-29 cells, which were first incubated with recombinant
HAI-1 (Fig. 3C and D). Cells that were treated with HAI-1 before the addition of fluorescently labeled scFv showed much
lower membrane-associated fluorescence than those that
were not treated. These data show that our antibodies only
minimally displace HAI-1 under the conditions used in the
fluorescence and the cell activity experiments, indicating that
the majority of the signal comes from free active MT-SP1.
Targeting MT-SP1 in vivo. Having successfully labeled active MT-SP1 in cell culture, the antibodies were evaluated as

probes for MT-SP1 activity in vivo. Based on cell culture data,
xenograft mouse models were generated using MCF-7, MCF7/Luc+, and MDA-MB-231/Luc+ breast cancer cell lines. The
“Luc+” designation indicates that the cells have been transfected with an imaging vector that includes the gene for Firefly luciferase so that the tumor can be imaged through
bioluminescence detection independent of MT-SP1–based
fluorescence detection (34). These mouse models were injected with fluorescently labeled diabody, Fab, or IgG, and
imaged for up to 50 hours to assess biodistribution of antibodies and any tumor localization. The anti–MT-SP1 diabody
and Fab localized to the tumor in MCF-7 xenograft mice but
failed to achieve high tumor/background contrast due to
high levels of signal retained in the excretory system (Supplementary Data Fig. S3). The IgG, however, localized to the tumor in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/Luc+ mice and remained so
until free protein was cleared, achieving excellent tumor to
background contrast by 50 hours (Fig. 4A; Supplementary
Data Fig. S4). Similar injections into MDA-MB-231/Luc+
tumor-bearing mice showed no tumor-associated signal over
the same period (Fig. 4B). Luciferin administered to these
mice generated a tumor-specific signal, validating both the
presence of the MCF-7/Luc+ and MDA-MB-231/Luc+ cells
at this location and sufficient vasculature to deliver the

labeled antibodies to the tumor. These experiments indicate that MT-SP1 is active in the tumors that are positive
for MT-SP1 expression, and that this activity can be targeted
in vivo for noninvasive cancer imaging using the antibodies
as probes.

Discussion
Proteases have long been recognized as cancer biomarkers; however, based on indications that it is activity that
is important for cancer progression, perhaps a more direct
strategy for disease assessment is to measure the active form
of the enzyme. The approach described here, from phage display to in vivo imaging, could be readily applied to any number of cancer-associated proteases, particularly those
anchored to the cell membrane, to identify additional sites
for targeting tumors in vivo.
The tools described here may have many uses in studying
MT-SP1 both in the laboratory and the clinic. Although immunohistochemistry and expression data have strongly
connected MT-SP1 to cancer, these experiments have focused on overall protein levels rather than the amount of
proteolytic activity. The antibody-mediated targeting of
active MT-SP1 described here may provide a new way to
measure protease activity and connect it with specific
downstream effects both in cell culture and in mouse models, such as the recently proposed prometastatic signaling
pathway involving MT-SP1, the growth factor MSP, and its
receptor RON (22, 23).
These antibodies may also prove useful for studying the
biology of MT-SP1 at the cellular level. Recent results have

1510

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

shown that HAI-1 recycles between the membranes of polarized epithelial cells, and it is proposed that MT-SP1 may be
transported between membranes in a similar fashion, perhaps in complex with HAI-1 (37). Although further studies
are necessary, it is possible that the punctuate fluorescence
observed when the labeled antibodies are added to unfixed
MCF7 and LNCaP cells is a result of internalization of antibody-bound enzyme, indicating that MT-SP1 is indeed capable of reentering the cell after it is exocytosed to the
extracellular membrane.
MT-SP1 detection and inhibition may also find use in the
clinic. Small-molecule inhibitors of MT-SP1 have shown that
in vivo inhibition has potential in anticancer therapy (38).
Antibodies could achieve similar results while allowing for
more specific targeting and inhibition, minimizing toxicity.
As an imaging biomarker, MT-SP1 expression has been correlated with cancer stage and/or subtype, and a noninvasive
method for assessing the activity in the malignant tissue may
aid in tumor classification and potential therapeutic design.
Independent of the utility of MT-SP1 inhibition in cancer
therapy, it can be used as an imaging biomarker to assess
tumor margin or monitor tumor response to alternative therapies in MT-SP1–positive tumors.
Previous studies connecting MT-SP1 and related type
2 transmembrane serine proteases to cancer have suggested their potential as biomarkers (39). This work shows
that MT-SP1 activity is present in tumors and can be targeted and inhibited on the surface of cancer cells using
specific antibodies, validating an approach that can be used
to target cell surface proteolysis for cancer assessment and
intervention.
