BACKGROUND: To validate pathologic markers of response to preoperative chemotherapy as predictors of disease-free survival
(DFS) after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS: One hundred seventy-one patients who underwent resection
of CLM after preoperative chemotherapy at 4 centers were studied. Pathologic response—defined as the proportion of tumor cells
remaining (complete, 0%; major, <50%; minor, 50%) and tumor thickness at the tumor-normal liver interface (TNI) (<0.5 mm, 0.5 to
<5 mm, 5 mm)—was assessed by a central pathology reviewer and local pathologists. RESULTS: Pathologic response was complete
in 8% of patients, major in 49% of patients, and minor in 43% of patients. Tumor thickness at the TNI was <0.5 mm in 21% of patients,
0.5 to <5 mm in 56% of patients, and 5 mm in 23% of patients. On multivariate analyses, using either pathologic response or tumor
thickness at TNI, pathologic response (P 5.002, .009), tumor thickness at TNI (P 5 0.015, <.001), duration of preoperative chemotherapy (P 5.028, .043), number of CLM (P 5.038, . 037), and margin (P 5.011, .016) were associated with DFS. In a multivariate analysis
using both parameters, tumor thickness at TNI (P 5.004, .015), duration of preoperative chemotherapy (P 5.025), number of nodules
(P 5.027), and margin (P 5.014) were associated with DFS. Tumor size by pathology examination was the predictor of pathologic
response. Predictors of tumor thickness at the TNI were tumor size and chemotherapy regimen. There was near perfect agreement
for pathologic response (j 5 .82) and substantial agreement (j 5 .76) for tumor thickness between the central reviewer and local
pathologists. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic response and tumor thickness at the TNI are valid predictors of DFS after preoperative

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal liver metastases (CLM) affect 50% of patients with colorectal cancer and account for two-thirds of deaths from
this disease.1 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and liver resection is widely used to treat patients with CLM.2-5 Liver resection
for CLM is supported by improved 5-year survival after surgery performed with curative intent.6,7 However, approximately 70% of patients develop disease recurrence after resection.8

Chemoresponse in Colon Liver Metastasis/Brouquet et al

Validated pathologic predictors of response to preoperative chemotherapy are of particular interest, because in
addition to predicting patient outcome, they contribute to the
evaluation of tumor biology and may be used to tailor postoperative treatment. These markers could be used as end points
in studies of the efficacy of new drugs, an approach recently
validated by the US Food and Drug Administration for studies in breast cancer,9 and could also be used as end points in
studies of new biomarkers for response to chemotherapy.
Tumor regression after chemotherapy, measured via
imaging and pathologic examination of the CLM, has
been tested as a prognostic factor for patient outcome in
several studies.10-15 Two different pathologic markers of
response to preoperative chemotherapy—pathologic
response, defined as the percentage of residual viable tumor cells, and tumor thickness at the tumor-normal liver
interface (TNI)—were shown to be associated with survival after resection of CLM in a large single-center
cohort.13,14 These markers have also shown to be associated with preoperative imaging response described using
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)
and morphologic criteria.14,16 However, the applicability
of these 2 semiquantitative histopathologic markers in different patient populations has not been confirmed.
The aim of this study was to validate the 2 previously
described pathologic markers of response to preoperative
chemotherapy—pathologic response and tumor thickness
at the TNI—in a diverse patient population from several
institutions and to test the agreement between local/peripheral pathologists from those institutions and central/
expert pathology review.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional
review boards of all the participating institutions. The
study included patients who underwent preoperative
chemotherapy followed by resection of CLM with curative intent (from 2001 to 2010) at 4 major hepatobiliary
centers (Center Leon Bernard, Lyon, France; Ambroise
Pare Hospital, Paris, France; The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; and Medical
University of Vienna, Austria). Inclusion criteria were
resection of CLM with curative intent within 3 months after completion of preoperative chemotherapy; duration of
preoperative chemotherapy less than 10 months; and preoperative chemotherapy consisting of either a fluoropyrimidine-based,
fluropyrimidine1irinotecan-based
regimen or a fluoropyrimidine1oxaliplatin-based regiCancer

men with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab. Patients
received preoperative chemotherapy either for initially
unresectable or up-front resectable CLM. Adjuvant chemotherapy for primary colorectal cancer was not taken into
account except for patients with synchronous CLM.
Patients were excluded if they underwent staged liver
resection, previous portal vein embolization, radiofrequency ablation concomitant to liver resection, or hepatic
artery infusion. Patients with postoperative follow-up
time less than 12 months and cause of death other than
colorectal cancer were also excluded. Each center selected
its patient population on the basis of these predefined criteria independently of the participating pathologists.
For each patient, the following demographic and clinicopathologic factors were collected by review of medical
records: age, sex, site of primary tumor, primary tumor
lymph node status, timing of detection of CLM in relation
to detection of the primary tumor (synchronous or metachronous), type of liver resection (major [resection of 3
liver segments] or minor [all other procedures]), number of
CLM, diameter of the largest metastasis, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, type and number of
cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, surgical margin status,
postoperative complications, and recurrence status.
Assessment of Pathologic Response and Tumor
Thickness at the TNI

Pathologic response and tumor thickness at the TNI were
assessed as described previously.13,14 All CLM were macroscopically localized in the surgical specimen after correlation with radiologic findings. In patients with multiple
CLM, each lesion was sampled extensively from the center
to the periphery to include multiple sections of tumor and
nonneoplastic liver parenchyma. Hematoxylin and eosinstained sections were reviewed independently by 2 pathologists: the corresponding institution’s gastrointestinal pathologist (C.J., J.S., A.I.L., and A.A.) and the central
pathology reviewer (D.M.M). The number of years of experience of these pathologists ranged from 4 to 15 years.
All pathologists were blinded from other pathologists’
interpretations, clinical information, treatment regimens,
and study end points. The pathology parameters assessed
by the central pathology reviewer were used for the analyses of predictors of survival and predictors of pathologic
response and tumor thickness at the TNI.
For the assessment of pathologic response, residual
carcinoma was measured semiquantitatively by estimating
the area of residual cancer cells as a proportion of the total
tumor area, as described previously.13 The tumor area
included areas of acellular mucin, tumor necrosis,

chemotherapy-related tissue injury, and other reparative
changes. Pathologic response was categorized as follows:
no residual cancer cells, complete response; 1% to 49%
residual cancer cells, major response; and 50% or more residual cancer cells, minor response (Figure 1A). In
patients with multiple tumor nodules, the mean of the
values for the various tumor nodules was used.
The tumor thickness at the TNI was measured perpendicular to the TNI at the focus with the maximum
number of contiguous tumor cells in millimeters using a
ruler or ocular micrometer (Figure 1B). In all tumors, the
thickness was measured at multiple foci, and the greatest
2780

thickness was used in the analysis. In specimens with multiple tumors, tumor thickness was measured separately for
each tumor nodule, and the average thickness was used for
analysis, as described previously.14
A positive surgical margin was defined as the presence of tumor cells at or within 1 mm of the line of
transection.
Statistical Analysis

Quantitative variables are expressed as the median (range)
and frequency. Comparisons between groups were analyzed with a chi-square or Fisher exact test for proportions

models of multivariate analysis were created to appropriately assess the impact of these 2 parameters. Model 1
included all factors with P  0.1 in the univariate analysis
except tumor thickness at TNI. Model 2 included all
factors with P  0.1 in univariate analysis except pathologic response. Model 3 included both pathologic
response and tumor thickness at TNI with other parameters with P  0.1 in a univariate model. Because these
pathology markers were first described by pathologists at
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a
level of agreement was assessed between a central pathology reviewer at MD Anderson and local pathologists at
the 4 study institutions using Spearman correlation and j
statistics with quadratic weighting.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 19.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).

and the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test
for continuous variables as appropriate.
Disease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated
from the date of liver resection to the date of last
follow-up or recurrence using the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared using log-rank tests. DFS was preferred
over overall survival as the end point because of its specificity for disease-related outcome and insufficient maturity of the overall survival data from the institutions
participating in this study. Univariate and multivariate
analyses were used to examine the relationship between
DFS and various clinical and pathologic factors. All
variables associated with DFS with P  0.1 in a univariate
proportional hazards model were subsequently entered
into a Cox multivariate regression model with backward
elimination (conditional logistic regression). Statistical
significance was defined as P < 0.05.
The pathologic response and tumor thickness at the
TNI both reflect tumor regression after preoperative
chemotherapy and correlated strongly with each other in
our previous study.14 Due to this interdependence, 3

The patient population included 88 men and 83 women
with mean age of 60 years (range, 26-85 years). The
patients’ clinicopathologic characteristics by treating center are summarized in Table 1. The primary tumor characteristics did not significantly differ between the 4 study
centers. However, there were differences between the 4
centers with respect to age, sex, type of liver resection,
diameter of the largest colorectal liver metastasis, preoperative CEA level, and type and median months of duration
of preoperative chemotherapy regimen. Seventy of 106
patients with synchronous primary and liver metastases
underwent colon resection followed by preoperative
chemotherapy for liver metastases which was followed by
liver resection. Eighteen patients underwent preoperative
chemotherapy followed by synchronous colon and liver
resection. Eight patients underwent preoperative chemotherapy followed by liver resection which was followed by
resection of colon tumor. Adjuvant therapy for primary
colon cancer was taken into account in 10 patients.
Among the 65 patients with metachronous CLM,
32 stage III patients received adjuvant chemotherapy for
the primary tumor and, at the diagnosis of liver metastases, preoperative chemotherapy for liver metastases.
Remaining 33 stage I-II patients with metachronous
CLM, received preoperative chemotherapy for either multiple, or larger than 5 cm, or initially unresectable liver
metastases.
One hundred four (61%) patients received single line
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, 49 (28%) patients received single line irinotecan2781

remaining 18 (11%) patients received multiple preoperative chemotherapy lines regimens containing both oxaliplatin and irinotecan (n 5 13), fluropyrimidines only (n 5 4),
or cetuximab (n 5 1). The preoperative chemotherapy regimen at 1 center included bevacizumab for all patients,
whereas another center included all patients without bevacizumab. The other two centers included patients with and
without bevacizumab. The majority of patients had multiple liver metastases (104 [60%]). The median diameter of
the largest tumor nodule was 3.1 cm (range, 0.3-13 cm).
Most patients (93 [54%]) had major hepatectomy. One
hundred thirty-three (78%) patients received postoperative
chemotherapy. Postoperative reversible complications
occurred in 48 (28%) patients, and tumor recurrence
occurred in 124 (72%) patients.
Pathologic examination showed complete response
in 14 (8%) patients, major response in 84 (49%), and
2782

minor response in 73 (43%). Tumor thickness at the TNI
was <0.5 mm in 35 (21%) patients, 0.5 to <5 mm in 97
(56%) patients, and 5 mm in 39 (23%) patients. Eight
(5%) patients had positive surgical resection margin.
Predictors of DFS

The median duration of follow-up for DFS was 42
months (range, 3-121 months). Pathologic response and
tumor thickness at the TNI were both associated with
DFS as continuous variables (P 5 .002 and P 5 .001,
respectively). DFS curves for each category of pathologic
response and tumor thickness at the TNI are shown in
Figure 2. By log-rank test, the survival differences between
complete and major response (P 5 .004) and between
major and minor response (P 5 .049) were statistically
significant. For the entire study population, the cumulative 3-year and 5-year DFS rates were 33% and 28%,
respectively. The cumulative 3-year and 5-year DFS rates,

respectively, by categories of response were as follows:
complete response, 77% and 77%; major response, 32%
and 31%; and minor response, 26% and 18%.
On log-rank test, the survival differences between
patients with tumor thickness at the TNI <0.5 mm and
0.5 to <5 mm and the survival difference between
patients with tumor thickness at the TNI 0.5 to <5 mm
and 5 mm were statistically significant (P 5 0.002). The
cumulative 3-year and 5-year DFS rates, respectively, by
categories of tumor thickness at the TNI were as follows:
<0.5 mm, 58% and 58%; 0.5 to <5 mm, 31% and 24%;
and 5 mm, 15% and 11%.
Results of univariate and multivariate analyses of the
predictors of DFS are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. On univariate analysis, factors associated with
worse 3- and 5-year survival were high preoperative CEA
level, duration of preoperative chemotherapy >3 months,
minor versus major or complete pathologic response,
major versus complete pathologic response, tumor thickness at the TNI  0.5 mm, and positive resection margin.
In model 1 of multivariate analysis, minor and major
pathologic response were associated with shorter DFS (for
minor pathologic response, P 5 .002 and HR 5 6.33; for
major pathologic response, P 5 .009 and HR 5 4.72). In
model 2, a higher tumor thickness at TNI independently
predicted a shorter DFS (for tumor thickness 5mm,
P<.001 and HR 5 3.89; for tumor thickness from 0.5
mm to <5 mm, P 5 .015 and HR 5 2.07). Finally, in
model 3, tumor thickness at TNI was independently assoCancer

ciated with DFS (P 5 .004 and HR 5 2.71 for tumor
thickness 5mm; P 5 .015 and HR 5 2.03 for tumor
thickness from 0.5 mm to <5 mm). In all three models of
multivariate analysis, duration of chemotherapy >3
months, number of tumor nodules 3, and positive resection margin were independent predictors of worse 3- and
5-year survival.
Predictors of Pathologic Response and Tumor
Thickness at the TNI

Results of a univariate analysis of predictors of pathologic
response and tumor thickness at the TNI are shown in
Table 4. Tumor size was the only predictor of pathologic
response. Predictors of smaller tumor thickness at the
TNI were smaller tumor size, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, and use of bevacizumab.

The local pathologists and the central pathology reviewer
agreed with respect to categorization of both pathologic

patients. In 167 (98%) patients, there was agreement for 1
of the 2 parameters. Disagreement for both parameters
was observed in only 4 (2%) patients.

Figure 3. Scatter plot correlating measurements of (A) pathologic response and (B) tumor thickness at the tumor-normal liver
interface (TNI) between the central pathology reviewer and local pathologists.

shows a strong linear correlation between tumor thickness
measured by local pathologists and tumor thickness measured by the central pathology reviewer. The overall j
between central pathology reviewer and local pathologist
was 0.76 (substantial agreement).
DISCUSSION
This study validates pathologic response and tumor thickness at the TNI as predictors of DFS in an independent,
multicenter series of patients with CLM who underwent
resection after routinely used preoperative chemotherapy
regimens. In addition, our findings indicate good interobserver agreement between the central pathology reviewer
and local pathologists in the measured values of these 2
parameters.
Pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy
has been shown to be of prognostic significance in cancers
of solid organs, including the breast, esophagus, and rectum.17-19 Given the approximate 2- and 5-year median
time to recurrence or death after hepatectomies for colorectal cancer, implementation of a pathologic response
end point would substantially increase interest in novel
drug development in this setting. In addition, studies
designed to assess potential biomarkers for response to
chemotherapy in cancer of solid organs frequently use
pathologic response as a primary or secondary end
point.20,21 Our findings suggest that pathologic response
and tumor thickness at TNI may also be suitable end
points for studies of biomarkers assessment for response
to chemotherapy in patients with CLM.
The pathologic markers validated in this study could
also make it possible to tailor postoperative chemotherapy
in patients with CLM on the basis of the response to preoperative chemotherapy. At present, patients with CLM
2786

usually receive the same chemotherapy regimen before
and after surgery regardless of the response to preoperative
chemotherapy.2 In the future, patients who do not
respond adequately to preoperative chemotherapy as
judged on the basis of measurement of our 2 validated
prognostic markers could be switched to a different and
hopefully more effective chemotherapy regimen after
resection of the metastases. This concept has never been
evaluated and could be tested prospectively.
Several criteria have been described for categorization of regression of colorectal metastases after chemotherapy. In a single-institution study of patients
undergoing resection after preoperative chemotherapy
without inclusion of bevacizumab, tumor regression grade
based on semiquantitative assessment of fibrosis and residual tumor cells in resected CLM was associated with survival outcome.11 In a large single-institution study, Adam
et al12 demonstrated superior survivor outcome of
patients with complete pathologic response. Blazer et al13
showed that pathologic response categorized as complete,
major, or minor response was associated with overall survival on multivariate analysis. Subsequently, Maru et al14
showed that tumor thickness at the TNI was associated
with recurrence-free survival and preoperative imaging
response. The latter study showed that the highest uninterrupted tumor thickness at TNI for 1 tumor nodule and
the mean of all maximum tumor thicknesses of multiple
tumors was significantly associated with DFS. Since the
response of preoperative chemotherapy is heterogenous in
different tumor nodules, mean of maximum tumor thickness at TNI was used for the correlation in patients with
multiple tumors in this study and a prior study.14 Using
only the maximum thickness in case of multiple tumors
would likely to skew the data toward the tumors with

poor response. The present study is a validation of the
studies by Blazer et al13 and Maru et al14 with a focus on
DFS. The tumor thickness at the TNI was found to be a
better predictor of DFS in a multivariate analysis that
included both pathologic response and tumor thickness at
TNI. However, due to the interdependence of these two
parameters, we propose that both the parameters should
be included in the pathology report because they were significant in multivariate analyses when one of them was
excluded. Although not included in this study, a scoring
system that includes these 2 parameters and other parameters, including tumor size, number of tumor nodules, and
margin status, to predict patient outcome of CLM may
contribute significantly in postoperative management of
patients with CLM.
There were significant differences in clinical and
treatment characteristics between the patients at the study
4 centers. Validation of the 2 tested pathology markers in
this heterogeneous patient population supports application of these markers in a wide population of patients
with resected CLM. The significance of these pathology
parameters as markers of chemotherapy response is
enhanced by good agreement between the central pathology reviewer and the local pathologists. In a very small
percentage of cases (2%), there was disagreement in categorization of both parameters. The higher rate of agreement with respect to just 1 of the 2 pathologic markers as
compared with agreement with respect to both markers
favors including information about both markers in the
surgical pathology report.
The present study also validated previously
described predictors of pathology response and tumor
thickness at the TNI. Tumor size was the predictor of
pathologic response in the present study and in previous
studies by Adam et al12 and Blazer et al.13 Similar to a previous study by Maru et al,14 an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen and bevasizumab were associated with
thin tumor thickness at the TNI in the present study.
In conclusion, this study is the first to validate the
pathologic markers of response to chemotherapy as predictors of DFS in patients undergoing resection of CLM.
The pathologic response and tumor thickness at the TNI
are reliable criteria that may be used in routine clinical
practice and are new end points for the assessment of biomarkers of chemotherapy response.
