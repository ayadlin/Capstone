ABSTRACT
The recently described oncogene ZNF217 belongs to a chromosomal region that is
frequently amplified in human cancers. Recent findings have revealed that alternative
mechanisms such as epigenetic regulation also govern the expression of the encoded
ZNF217 protein. Newly discovered molecular functions of ZNF217 indicate that it
orchestrates complex intracellular circuits as a new key regulator of tumorigenesis.
In this review, we focus on recent research on ZNF217-driven molecular functions in
human cancers, revisiting major hallmarks of cancer and highlighting the downstream
molecular targets and signaling pathways of ZNF217. We also discuss the exciting
translational medicine investigating ZNF217 expression levels as a new powerful
biomarker, and ZNF217 as a candidate target for future anti-cancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

among tumors) [5-7] and linked to poor outcome in some
studies [8-11].
The ZNF217 protein is a member of the Kruppellike family of transcription factors and contains 8
predicted C2H2 zinc finger motifs and a proline-rich
region [3]. It binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate
target gene expression [12, 13], is a component of a human
histone deacetylase complex (CoREST-HDAC) [12, 14,
15], and is found in complexes with the transcriptional
co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), the
histone demethylases LSD1 and KDM5B/JARID1B/
PLU-1, and the methyltransferases G9a and EZH2 [8,
12, 14-18]. ZNF217 was first described to mainly act as a
transcriptional repressor complex, as reviewed previously
[8], however additional research has shown that it
positively regulates the expression of specific target genes
[13, 15, 19, 20], making it a complex and double-faceted
transcriptional regulator.
An increasing body of research indicates that
ZNF217 interferes with several intracellular signaling
networks for reprogramming cancer cells. Evidence
also suggests that ZNF217 expression levels are not
systematically associated with the ZNF217 gene

During tumor progression, normal cells evolve
progressively to a neoplastic state through the successive
acquisition of hallmark capabilities. The hallmarks of
cancer - distinctive and complementary capabilities that
enable tumor growth and metastatic dissemination continue to provide a solid foundation for understanding
the biology of cancer and have been remarkably reviewed
by Hanahan and Weinberg [1, 2]. The numerous signaling
molecules orchestrating tumorigenesis operate through
elaborate integrated circuits governing intracellular
signaling networks. In this context, discovering new
master regulators and their functional roles, is of utmost
interest.
The zinc-finger protein 217 (ZNF217) is an
oncogenic protein that plays deleterious functions in
various human cancers. The ZNF217 gene is located at
the 20q13 chromosomal region [3], which is frequently
amplified in human tumors [4]. This region also contains
several oncogenes thought to confer selective advantages
to cancer cells. Increased copy numbers of ZNF217 have
been reported in various tumors (frequency is variable

amplification status and that other events, such as the
action of miRNAs [21-23] and promoter methylation
[24-26], also impact ZNF217 expression. It is therefore
important to decipher the complex molecular events that
this protein may orchestrate, aside from ZNF217 genomic
amplification. In this review, we revisit ZNF217-driven
molecular functions in human cancers through the major
hallmarks of cancer [1, 2]: sustained proliferative signals,
evasion from growth suppressors, replicative immortality,
resistance to cell death, cancer stem cell enrichment, and
activation of invasion and metastasis. We will focus on
the molecular targets and signaling pathways associated
with or activated by ZNF217 as well as recently identified
ZNF217 protein partners. This review will also describe
the evolving landscape of translational medicine with
regards to assessing ZNF217 expression levels (mRNA
or protein) as a new prognostic or predictive biomarker
for anti-cancer therapies. Finally, we will discuss the
emerging therapeutic strategies to counteract ZNF217 or
ZNF217-driven deleterious effects in cancer.

ZNF217 has been depicted to impact one of the
most fundamental traits of cancer cells involving their
ability to sustain chronic proliferation via the deregulation
of signals that allow progression through the cell cycle,
cell growth and disruption of anti-proliferative signaling.
Indeed, in vitro overexpression of ZNF217 promoted cell
proliferation in ovarian [27] and breast cancer cells [28],
whereas silencing of ZNF217 reduced it in prostate [23],
colorectal [21], ovarian [7, 29] and breast [28] cancer
cells. In vivo, constitutive expression of ZNF217 in breast
or ovarian cancer cells stimulated the growth and the rate
of tumor formation [20, 27, 28, 30]. The rapid proliferation
of ZNF217-overexpressing cells was correlated with a
significant increase in S phase population [27], aberrant
expression of several cyclins and, by a post-transcriptional
mechanism, with aberrant elevated expression of Aurora-A
(Aurora kinase A/AURKA/STK15) [28] (Figure 1).
The ErbB3 gene was identified as a direct target
for the ZNF217 transcription factor and was the first
gene shown to be positively regulated by recruitment
of ZNF217 to its promoter [19]. ZNF217 and ErbB3
expression levels showed significant correlation in human

[37]. The eEF1A2 gene is, like ZNF217, located on
chromosome 20q13. As this locus is not necessarily
amplified in the ZNF217-immortalized IOSE cells [35] and
as interaction between ZNF217 protein and eEF1A2 gene
regulatory regions appears negligible [13], the authors
suggested that ZNF217-driven eEF1A2 transcription likely
occurs through an indirect mechanism, perhaps involving
the ZNF217-induced inhibition of negative regulator(s)
of eEF1A2 expression [37]. Altogether, these studies
demonstrate that ZNF217 is a new oncogene that drives
neoplastic progression in breast and ovarian cancers, and
may act interdependently with eEF1A2. As HMECs lack
functional p16INK4a and IOSE cells lack functional p53 and
pRB, defects in these principal regulators of proliferation
and senescence might be important contributing factors
in ZNF217-mediated immortalization and/or neoplastic
progression.
Both immortalized ZNF217-transduced HMECs
and IOSE cells display stabilization of telomere
length and increased telomerase activity [34, 35], both
associated with senescence bypassing [38, 39]. ZNF217
attenuated apoptotic signals resulting from functionally
compromised telomeres [40] and ZNF217-immortalized
HMECs displayed increased expression of telomere
repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), as a likely consequence
of post-transcriptional regulation [41]. As artificially
overexpressed TRF2, is involved in safeguarding telomere
structures [42] and reported to delay senescence [43], one
could reasonably postulate that TRF2 mediates, at least
in part, ZNF217-driven immortalization. Telomerase
expression and activity can be enhanced through the
PI3K/Akt pathway [44] and a link between ZNF217 and
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been repeatedly
shown [19, 30, 40]. Future work is necessary to decipher
whether ZNF217 is involved, directly or indirectly, in any
post-transcriptional events driving TRF2 overexpression
and in any Akt-associated activation of the telomerase.
Altogether, ZNF217 has been identified as a new oncogene
acting at early stages of carcinogenesis, and capable of
bypassing senescence and promoting immortalization.

breast tumors [19], and ectopic ZNF217 expression
induced ErbB3 protein overexpression in normal human
mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and in breast cancer
cell lines (paired with increased ErbB2 expression)
[19, 20]. ZNF217 also sensitized breast cancer cells to
heregulin, the growth factor ligand for ErbB3 [30]. The
ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer functioning as an “oncogenic
unit”, the global impact of ZNF217 on ErbB receptor
expression maybe one possible mechanism by which
ZNF217 augments the PI3K/Akt, and possibly the MAPK
survival pathways [19, 30] (Figure 1).
The p15ink4b tumor suppressor, which inhibits cellcycle progression at the G1/S transition [31], has been
identified as a direct target of the ZNF217/CoREST
transcriptional complex [15]. This complex induced
transcriptional silencing of the p15ink4b gene through the
co-recruitment of the DNMT3A DNA methyltransferase
and promoter hypermethylation [14]. Importantly,
ZNF217 overexpression was sufficient to impair the antiproliferative TGF-β-dependent program through inhibition
of the recruitment of cofactors involved in the active
demethylation of the p15ink4b gene [14]. Corruption of the
TGF-β pathway is known to promote malignancy at an
early stage by stimulating evasion of cancer cells from
TGF-β anti-proliferative effects [32, 33]. Thus alteration
of DNA methylation status of target genes such as p15ink4b
is part of the ZNF217-dependent disruption of antiproliferative signals at the early stage of tumorigenesis
(Figure 1).

Enabling replicative immortality
The first study suggesting a link between ZNF217
and senescence demonstrated that transduction of finite
life span HMECs with ZNF217 gave rise to immortalized
cells with increased telomerase activity [34]. These cells
also exhibited an increased resistance to TGF-β-induced
anti-proliferative action while alterations in p53 and/
or pRB did not seem to contribute [34]. A second study
showed that ZNF217 transduction into SV40 Tag/tag
expressing, p53/pRB-deficient, human ovarian surface
epithelial cells (named IOSE cells) promoted neoplastic
progression associated with telomerase activity, anchorage
independence, genomic changes and aberrant geneexpression levels similar to those observed in ovarian
carcinomas [35]. However, the immortalization driven
by ZNF217 could not be obtained in ovarian surface
epithelial (OSE) cells which possess functional p53 and
pRB. The oncogenic translation elongation factor eEF1A2
[36] is overexpressed in ZNF217-transduced IOSE cells
[35], and transduction of eEF1A2 in the same cells was
sufficient to induce neoplastic progression [37]. Finally,
eEF1A2 silencing reversed resistance to apoptosis induced
by ZNF217 overexpression, thus highlighting eEF1A2
as contributing towards the ZNF217-induced neoplastic
properties of these precursor cells of ovarian carcinomas

Resisting cell death
ZNF217 has been shown to interfere with the
apoptotic pathway at early stages of tumor progression, by
impairing apoptotic signals resulting from dysfunctional
telomeres [40], and in later stages, by conferring
resistance to chemotherapy [28, 40]. Doxorubicin is a
chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits topoisomerase II
and induces double-strand DNA breaks resulting in ATMdependent p53-mediated apoptosis. Taxanes such as
paclitaxel are microtubule-stabilizing agents that cause cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. Ectopic expression of ZNF217
conferred both doxorubicin and paclitaxel resistance in
breast cancer cells, and conversely, ZNF217 silencing
increased doxorubicin or paclitaxel sensitivity [28, 40].

several in vitro breast or ovarian cell models [20, 27, 30,
51]. Conversely, ZNF217 extinction allowed reversion of
these phenotypes in breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer
cells [20-22, 29, 52, 53]. miR-203 targeted ZNF217
mRNA for silencing and was associated with decreased
cell migration and invasion in colorectal cancer cells [21].
In mouse MECs, ZNF217 promoted loss of adhesion and
increased cell motility associated with reorganization of
actin cytoskeleton [30]. ZNF217 xenografts in mice were
prone to developing spontaneous metastases, especially
in lung, liver and lymph nodes [20, 27, 30] and high
ZNF217 expression levels were associated with metastases
in human breast tumors [20]. Several studies have used
gene-expression microarrays to extract gene networks in
the vicinity of ZNF217 in a cancer context [20, 30, 54,
55] and all revealed by gene ontology an effect on cell
adhesion, cell motility, migration and invasion, of ZNF217
deregulated expression. More particularly, identified
genes were those encoding proteins involved in cell
adhesion, in the focal adhesion pathway or in the TGF-β
pathway [20]. The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling
[56] was critical for ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor cooperation
required for transformation and invasion [57, 58]. In
breast cancer cells, ZNF217-induced overexpression
of ErbB2 and ErbB3 proteins is paired with increased
phospho-FAK levels [20]. eEF1A2 has been implicated
in actin remodeling, invasion and migration [36, 59] and
silencing eEF1A2 inhibited the anchorage-independent
growth mediated by ZNF217 in ovarian cells [37], again
suggesting that eEF1A2 might be a key player in ZNF217mediated deleterious effects (Figure 2).
Another major finding was that ZNF217 promotes
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human MECs,
associated with a significant reduction in expression of
epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, increased levels of
mesenchymal proteins and significantly increased mRNA
levels of transcription factors known as major drivers of
EMT (Snail1/2, Twist1/2, ZEB1/2) [20]. Some of these
features were validated in ZNF217-overexpressing mouse
MECs [30]. ZNF217 enrichment has been found in the
promoters for Snail1 and Snail2 genes in human breast
cancer cell lines and tumors [13], and the promoter of
the E-cadherin gene is a direct target for ZNF217 [12].
ZNF217-overexpressing cells also possess sustained
activation of the TGF-β pathway as the consequence of
a TGF-β autocrine loop, and direct binding of ZNF217
to TGFB2 or TGFB3 promoters was found to increase
expression and thus secretion of active TGF-βs [20].
Finally, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway led to the reversal
of ZNF217-dependent features of EMT and invasion, thus
highlighting the TGF-β-activated Smad signaling pathway
as a major driver of ZNF217-induced EMT. The authors’
proposed model for ZNF217-driven EMT incorporates
the direct transcriptional down-regulation of E-cadherin
expression and/or the constitutive activation of the TGFβ-activated Smad signaling pathway [20]. An increased

This ZNF217-driven drug resistance was not achieved
through the ABCB1/PgP transporter [28], but rather by
ZNF217 interfering with the apoptotic signals induced
by the two drugs [28, 40]. ZNF217-driven paclitaxel or
doxorubicin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells is most
likely p53-independent, given that these cells possess
a nonfunctional mutated p53 [28], while activation of a
p53-dependent pathway involved in ZNF217-mediated
doxorubicin resistance in HBL-100 cells might not be
excluded [40].
ZNF217-mediated paclitaxel resistance in breast
cancer cells was associated with alterations in the intrinsic
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, through the deregulation
of the balance between anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL)
and pro-apoptotic (Bad, Bak and Bax) proteins’ expression
[28]. The BCL2L1 pre-mRNA gives rise after alternative
splicing to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL or the pro-apoptotic
Bcl-XS transcripts and complex regulation allows the shift
of the splicing in favor of one or the other. Aurora-A has
been implicated in regulating this splicing [45] and was
associated with increased expression of Bcl-XL [46] and
resistance to taxol-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer
[47]. ZNF217 induced overexpression of both the Bcl-XL
and Aurora-A proteins in paclitaxel-resistant ZNF217overexpressing breast cancer cells [28], and expression of
BCL2L1 protein correlated with that of ZNF217 mRNA in
colorectal tumors [48]. The mechanism behind ZNF217driven paclitaxel resistance thus likely involves, at least in
part, Aurora-A overexpression favoring the production of
the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL.
The anti-apoptotic activity of ZNF217 is also
mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt survival
pathway. Indeed, ectopic expression of ZNF217 led to
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, and silencing ZNF217
resulted in decreased Akt phosphorylation [19, 40]. A
feedback loop seems to exist between ZNF217 and the
Akt pathway, as inhibition of PI3K with the LY294002
inhibitor led to decreased ZNF217 protein expression
levels and increased apoptosis in response to doxorubicin
[40]. ErbB3-driven activation of PI3K/Akt was implicated
in resistance to paclitaxel [49] and, to date, the increased
expression of the ErbB3 gene, a direct target for the
ZNF217 transcription factor [19], is the only clearly
defined mechanism associated with the ZNF217-driven
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [19, 30]. As Aurora-A
[46, 50] and eEF1A2 [36] are also known to activate the
PI3K/Akt pathway, one cannot exclude that ZNF217driven survival and resistance to apoptosis via the PI3K/
Akt pathway is also Aurora-A- or eEF1A2-dependent.

level of complexity was highlighted with the discovery of
miR-200c targeting both ZEB1 and ZNF217 mRNAs and
of a miR-200c/ZNF217/TGF-β/ZEB1 circuit contributing
to EMT and invasion [22]. MiR-200c was shown to target
ZNF217 mRNA, ZNF217 protein to upregulate autocrine
TGF-β, and TGF-β signaling to transcriptionally activate
ZEB1, which itself could then exert a feedback inhibition
on miR-200c [60] (Figure 2). In many late-stage tumors,
TGF-β signaling is found redirected from suppressing
cell proliferation to EMT activation [61]. ZNF217 thus
leads to a compromised TGF-β pathway at later stages of
tumorigenesis, via a complex cross-talk that appears to
involve, at least, direct transcriptional or miRNA-driven
regulating events.

proposed as the driving force of tumorigenesis and the
seeds of metastases [62]. Recent research has linked the
acquisition of CSC traits with the EMT transdifferentiation
program [63]. Several investigations revealed that ZNF217
binds to the promoter of genes involved in differentiation
and organ development and is associated with deregulated
expression of genes involved in repression of cell
differentiation and maintenance of CSCs [13, 20, 30].
ZNF217 was also found upregulated in the recently
formed somites of mouse embryos compared to presomitic
mesoderm [64], supporting a possible involvement in
somite development.
Overexpression of ZNF217 in normal primary
mammary epithelial cells or breast cancer cells increased
the formation of mammospheres displaying self-renewal
capacity [20, 30, 51] and was associated with repression of
an adult stem cell expression signature that is also found
downregulated in cancer [30]. ZNF217-driven increased
motility, EMT stimulation and increased clonogenicity are
associated with a less differentiated or more mesenchymal

phenotype. In normal mammary epithelium, ZNF217
expression was enriched in the CD24MedCD49fHigh cell
population, which includes basal, myoepithelial and
progenitor cells, compared with CD24HighCD49fLow cells,
which include luminal and luminal progenitor cells [30].
After transplantation of ZNF217-overexpressing cells
in mice, the corresponding tumors presented a more
basal pathology with increased dual-positive luminal
and basal cell marker expression [30]. Finally, ZNF217
expression was repressed in pluripotent embryonal cells
after treatment with the differentiating agent retinoic
acid, suggesting that aberrant expression of ZNF217 in
differentiated adult cells may suppress differentiation,
leading to tumorigenesis [13].
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive and
common type of primary brain tumor that is hypothesized
to be driven by from a subpopulation of glioma stem cells
(GSCs) [65]. Within these GSCs, ZNF217 is severalfold more highly expressed than in non-GSCs [66].
Forced differentiation of GSCs downregulated ZNF217
and knockdown of ZNF217 inhibited the proliferation
of GSCs and reduced stem-like cell populations [66].
As Aurora-A may regulate self-renewal capacity in
glioma-initiating cells via stabilization/activation of
β-catenin/Wnt signaling [67], it might also be involved
in ZNF217-driven maintenance of a stem-like phenotype.
Hypoxia is a tumor micro-environmental factor that is
critical for the GSC niche [68]. Importantly, ZNF217 is
regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) through
direct or indirect mechanisms, suggesting that ZNF217
may be a downstream target of HIFs that promotes the
hypoxia-induced stemness of GSCs [66]. In conclusion,
ZNF217 plays a role in cell reprogramming by promoting
self-renewal, maintaining stem cells and inhibiting
differentiation.

in glioblastoma but not in normal brain tissue [26]. In
breast tumors, the methylation status at the ZNF217
gene promoter correlated with ZNF217 gene-expression
levels [24, 51] while in peripheral blood cells, lack of
methylation at the ZNF217 locus predicted breast cancer
risk (p = 0.006) [76]. Clearly, investigating the biomarker
value of ZNF217 gene-expression levels, independently
of the ZNF217 amplification status appears worthwhile.
In the original work depicting the ZNF217 gene,
higher ZNF217 transcript levels were found in breast tumor
samples than in the corresponding normal epithelium [3].
Further observations revealed that ZNF217 mRNA and
protein were overexpressed in primary prostate carcinoma
versus normal prostate tissue (p < 0.05 and 14 out of
23 analyzed cases, respectively) [23] and in colorectal
carcinoma tissues associated with poor clinicopathological
features (p < 0.05) [52]. High ZNF217 mRNA levels were
present in glioma samples compared to normal tissue and
associated with poor outcome (univariate analysis, p <
0.001) [66]. RTQ-PCR investigation in several primary
breast cancer cohorts found that high ZNF217 mRNA
levels were associated with shorter relapse-free survival
(RFS) (univariate analysis, p = 0.003, p = 0.017 and p =
0.02 [20]; p = 0.015 [51]) and with the development of
metastases (p = 0.002, p = 0.0008 and p = 0.025 [20]).
Retrospective analysis of transcriptomic data confirmed
that ZNF217 was a marker of poor prognosis linked with
shorter RFS (univariate analysis, p = 0.01 [20]; p = 0.01
[30]) and overall survival (OS) (univariate analysis, p =
0.003 [30]; p = 0.037 [51]). The most remarkable results
arose from analysis of publicly available microarray
data for 2,414 and 2,978 breast cancer patients [77, 78],
in which it was found that high levels of expression of
ZNF217 were associated with poor prognosis, with p
values of, respectively, 1 × 10−11 [20] and 3 × 10−9 [51].
Interestingly, ZNF217 mRNA expression was found to
be an independent prognostic marker more informative
than lymph node (multivariate analysis, p < 0.05, [20]
or estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) status (multivariate
analysis, p = 0.04 [30]). In terms of predicting treatment
response, retrospective analysis of two independent
expression datasets from breast cancer patients who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, showed lower levels
of ZNF217 mRNA in responders compared to in nonresponders (p = 0.04 and p < 0.0001) [30]. Altogether,
these data suggest that in breast cancer, ZNF217 mRNA
expression is both a novel and powerful biomarker for
poor prognosis and a prognostic predictor of patient
outcome in response to chemotherapy. Investigation of
ZNF217 expression would thus allow the stratification of

ZNF217 gene expression product, a powerful
biomarker
Amplification at the ZNF217 locus has been
previously reviewed [8] and linked to poor prognosis in
several cancers [7, 9-11, 53]; however other authors have
failed to make this link [69-72], likely due to differences
in probes and cutoff levels used for amplification
evaluation. High levels of ZNF217 expression have
been documented in cell lines and tumors in which the
locus is amplified [3, 7, 73]; conversely, an absence of
correlation between ZNF217 amplification and ZNF217
expression levels has also been observed [3, 7, 72-74].
Epigenetic events such as miRNA targeting of ZNF217
and DNA methylation of ZNF217 promoter have recently
been highlighted providing important insight into the
molecular mechanisms regulating ZNF217 expression.
Several miRNAs (miR-203, miR-200c, miR-24) targeting
the 3’ UTR of ZNF217 mRNA were found to regulate

breast cancer patients into outcome-dependent subclasses.
Recently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed
on paraffin-embedded tissue samples revealed higher
ZNF217 protein expression levels in tumor tissue from
both squamous cervical cancer (10 out of 10 tested
samples) [79] and colorectal cancer (p < 0.05 [52], p
< 0.001 [21]) compared to in matched normal adjacent
tissue. ZNF217 protein levels were associated with
aggressive clinical markers (p < 0.05 [52] and p < 0.05
[21]) and shorter OS (univariate analysis, p = 0.028 [21])
in colorectal cancer and with shorter RFS (univariate
analysis, p = 0.0016) and OS (univariate analysis, p =
0.019) in gastric carcinoma [80]. The prognostic value
of ZNF217 protein levels in ovarian carcinoma has been
found in one study (univariate analysis, p = 0.042) [27],
but not in two others [7, 72]. The abovementioned studies
differed in terms of the anti-ZNF217 antibodies used, the
cutoff levels or scores for considering ZNF217 expression
signal, as well as the subcellular localization signals
taken into account (Table 1). When the information was
available, nuclear [7, 72, 80] or cytoplasmic staining only

[21] were used. Interestingly, both nuclear and cytoplasmic
ZNF217 staining has been used to define an IHC ZNF217
index in a breast cancer study [51]. Nuclear staining
corroborated the transcription factor role of ZNF217 and
was also observed after ectopic expression of ZNF217 in
several cell lines [73]. No cytoplasmic ZNF217 function
has yet been deciphered, though several lines of evidence
indicate that it can localize in both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm. In OSE cells transduced with ZNF217, the
ZNF217 protein was prominent in the nuclei of stationary
senescent cells and cytoplasmic in proliferating cells
[35], suggesting that ZNF217 localization may depend
on the cells’ proliferative state. More recently, subcellular
fractionation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells revealed the
presence of endogenous ZNF217 protein predominantly in
the nuclear fractions, but also in the cytoplasmic fraction
[51]. Surprisingly, although ZNF217 cytoplasmic staining
was visible in some IHC pictures, it was neither mentioned
nor discussed by the authors (Table 1). These new findings
support the existence of a ZNF217 protein pool of
unknown biological function, localized in the cytoplasm

with an active ERα signaling context in breast cancer, enhancement of ERα signaling and endocrine therapy resistance. ZNF217 is also a

of cancer cells. Altogether, evaluating ZNF217 protein
biomarker value in tumor samples is complex, and the
expected data from future studies dedicated to deciphering
the meaning of ZNF217 cytoplasmic localization may help
in considering ZNF217 nuclear and/or cytoplasmic signals
in translational medicine.

factors belonging to the ERα network (ERα, GATA3 and
FOXA1) [82].
Assessing the prognostic value of ZNF217
mRNA expression levels (RTQ-PCR) in the molecular
classification of breast cancers, revealed it as more
informative in luminal breast cancers (p = 0.006,
univariate analysis for RFS; p= 0.028, univariate analysis
for OS) than in HER2+ or triple negative subtypes (no
significance) [51]. The luminal-A subtype is considered
to have the most favorable prognosis, exhibiting higher
expression levels of ESR1, ERα and ER-related genes and
a lower proliferative index than the luminal-B subtype. Of
utmost interest, two studies revealed that the prognostic
power of both ZNF217 mRNA (p = 0.02, considering
RFS, [51]; p = 0.035, considering OS, [82]) and ZNF217
protein (p = 0.01 for RFS, [51]) (IHC ZNF217 index,
Table 1) expression levels were most discriminatory in the
luminal-A subtype compared with the luminal-B subtype
[51, 82]. Retrospective analysis of gene-expression array
data for 2,978 breast cancer patients revealed that high
levels of ZNF217 mRNA expression were strongly and
significantly associated with shorter RFS in the luminal
subgroup (p = 2.2 × 10−5), but were not prognostic in
HER2+ or triple negative subclasses. Again, the most
powerful prognostic value of ZNF217 was observed in the
luminal-A subgroup (p = 3.3 × 10−4), compared with the
luminal-B subclass (p = 0.07).
ZNF217 has also been associated with aberrant
response of endocrine therapy (a standard of care for
ER+ breast cancers). ZNF217 expression was deregulated
in endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer cells [85].
Ectopic expression of ZNF217 conferred aggressiveness
and tamoxifen endocrine therapy resistance to ER+ breast
cancer cells, while ZNF217 silencing restored tamoxifen
sensitivity in resistant breast cancer cells [51]. Finally,
high ZNF217 mRNA (univariate analysis, p = 0.02, p =
0.011, p = 0.047, p = 0.035) or protein levels (p = 0.05) in
human ER+ primary breast cancer tumors were predictors
of earlier relapse under endocrine therapy only (Table 1)
[51]. This was further validated by another group at the
ZNF217 mRNA level (p = 0.05) [82]. Further work is
however necessary in the neoadjuvant setting to confirm
the predictive value of ZNF217 for endocrine therapy
response.
Altogether, these data support the idea that the
functional interplay existing between ZNF217 and ERα
could be responsible, in tumors expressing high levels
of ZNF217, for an altered response to endocrine therapy
and poor outcome (Figure 3). However, other ZNF217driven mechanisms such as aberrant ErbB receptor
expression, Akt pathway activation, Aurora-A expression,
enrichment in stem-like cell population, all already linked
with endocrine therapy resistance [86-88], could also be
involved. In conclusion, the prognostic value of ZNF217
appears most powerful in the breast tumor subtypes where
ERα expression and ERα signaling are more prominent,

ZNF217 specific role and biomarker value in
ERα-positive breast cancers
Compelling data indicate a specific behavior of
ZNF217 in an ER+ context of breast cancers and a close
interplay between ZNF217 and ERα signaling. The
first evidence of this came from the observation that
ZNF217 is (directly or indirectly) an ERα target gene, as
17β-estradiol exposure led to ZNF217 mRNA deregulated
expression in ER+ breast cancer cells [81]. Further
investigations revealed that estrogen signaling disruption,
such as siRNA targeting ERα, could trigger epigenetic
silencing (hypermethylation) of the ZNF217 gene and that
the methylation status at the ZNF217 locus was higher in
ERα-negative (ER-) versus ER+ breast tumors [24]. In
peripheral blood cells, lack of methylation at the ZNF217
locus, predicting breast cancer risk, was associated with
ERα bioactivity in the corresponding serum [76]. ER+
breast tumors or cancer cell lines displayed higher ZNF217
expression levels compared to their ER- counterparts
(p = 0.0004, p = 0.005 and p = 1 × 10−7 [51]; p = 0.009
and p = 0.0001 [82]). In an ER+ breast cancer context,
high/positive ZNF217 expression levels thus seem to be
associated with functional estrogen signaling.
Besides the link between ZNF217 expression and
ERα status, a physical interaction between ERα and
ZNF217 proteins has been reported [51, 82, 83]. Indeed,
ZNF217 and ERα proteins interact via the C-terminus
region of ZNF217 and the hinge region of ERα, and
the interaction was visible both in the nucleus and in
the cytoplasm [51]. ZNF217 is capable of enhancing
ERα ligand-dependent classical genomic activity, at
least in part, by increasing the recruitment of ERα to
its estrogen response elements (demonstrated at the
endogenous level for the GREB1 gene, encoding for a
growth promoter protein) [51]. The significance of the
cytoplasmic interaction between ZNF217 and ERα is
currently unknown, but one hypothesis is that ZNF217
also modulates the non-genomic estrogen signaling, which
is linked to the activation of the Akt signaling cascade
[84]. A model for ZNF217-driven deleterious functions in
ER+ breast cancer cells involving interference with and
enhancement of ERα signaling and its related mitogenic
downstream events, at least via the direct genomic activity
of ERα, is proposed (Figure 3). A second study dedicated
to ZNF217 chromatin occupancy in the ER+ MCF-7 breast
cancer cell line supported these findings, revealing that
ZNF217 binding sites overlap with those of transcription

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS

which may reflect the impact of ZNF217 in modulating
existing active ERα signaling. ZNF217 expression levels
thus allow the re-stratification of breast cancer patients
considered as having a good prognosis, for whom no
other widely used biomarker is currently available.
Assessing ZNF217 expression levels may thus help
distinguish patients with an excellent outcome who would
benefit from endocrine therapy only (possessing low
ZNF217 expression levels), from those harboring tumors
possessing high ZNF217 expression levels that might
thus poorly respond to endocrine therapy and would need
more aggressive therapy (endocrine therapy combined to
chemotherapy).

In conclusion, accumulating data indicate that
ZNF217 is a key player in tumorigenesis, orchestrating
tumor progression at both early and late stages. ZNF217
cooperates with several intracellular signaling networks
to reprogram integrated circuits governing hallmark
capabilities within cancer cells. In this review, we have
extensively documented the implication of ZNF217
in the major hallmarks of cancer, including sustained
proliferative signals, growth suppressor evasion,
replicative immortality, resistance to cell death and
invasion activation (Figure 4). The direct or indirect
downstream actors are Aurora-A, eEF1A2, ErbB2/
ErbB3, p15ink4b, members of the Bcl-2 family, E-cadherin
and ERα, and are all involved in at least one, but most
of the time in several of the above-cited cancer features.
ZNF217-driven molecular functions are multiple and
involve ZNF217 direct binding at the promoter of target
genes (ErbB3, E-cadherin, TGFB2, TGFB3), indirect
transcriptional regulation (eEF1A2), epigenetic regulation
(p15ink4b), post-transcriptional events (Aurora-A) and
protein-protein interaction (ERα). Evidence of a close
interplay between ZNF217, or its molecular mediators,
and the TGF-β or the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways has
emerged recurrently, pointing out the importance of these
subcircuits and adding to the complexity with regards
the considerable interconnections existing between these
individual mediators.
The ZNF217 gene belongs to the 20q13 region,
a region frequently amplified in human cancers and
importantly, ZNF217 protein interferes and cooperates
with proteins encoded by other genes present in this
region (AURKA, BCL2L1, eEF1A2). Interestingly, the
prognostic significance of ZNF217 amplification seems to
be variable and depend on the concomitant presence of
co-amplified loci at 20q13 [74]. A model can be proposed
whereby ZNF217 cooperates with Aurora-A, BCL2L1 or
eEF1A2 in neoplastic progression of breast cancer through
genomic co-amplification and/or through ZNF217-driven
molecular regulation, which might amplify the impact of
any genomic amplification.
In many human tumors, the pervasive genomic
aberrations at the ZNF217 locus have provided clear
evidence for loss of control of genome integrity [16]
(Figure 4). Genome instability not only appears to be
associated with destabilization of gene copy number,
but also with nucleotide sequence polymorphisms or
DNA repair defects. The rs1056948 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) in the 3’ UTR of ZNF217 (with a
putative function in inactivating exonic splicing enhancer
sequences) and the rs61730988 SNP (responsible for
the E914D mutation) are associated with breast cancer
susceptibility [93, 94]. While ZNF217 has not yet been
linked to impaired DNA repair, it has been described as

Implications of experimental findings for clinical
medicine
Using in silico and in vitro screening approaches
to identify candidate therapeutics able to inhibit growth
of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217, triciribine (also
known as API-2) was revealed as a good drug candidate
[30]. This nucleoside analogue inhibits DNA synthesis
and allosterically inhibits AKT activation, and has been
tested in phase I clinical trials in patients with cancer
as well as in one phase II clinical trial in patients with
metastatic breast cancer [89-91]. Triciribine overcomes
in vitro ZNF217-induced doxorubicin resistance in breast
cancer cells, and in mice experiments is more effective
in inhibiting tumor growth of ZNF217-overexpressing
cells than control tumors [30]. To date, it is the only drug
tested in vivo that seems to counteract the ZNF217-driven
deleterious effects and has been proposed as a clinical
strategy to treat ZNF217+ cancer patients.
Among the alternative candidate strategies, miRNAs
represent a class of promising targets for therapeutic
intervention [92]. In particular, miR-200c, which targets
both ZNF217 and ZEB1, re-sensitized trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells to trastuzumab in vitro
and suppressed metastases in vivo [22]. The Aurora-A
kinase inhibitor III was efficient in reversing paclitaxel
resistance in ZNF217-overexpressing breast cancer
cells in vitro [28]. ZNF217-mediated EMT in normal
mammary epithelial cells could be reversed by treatment
with SB431542, which is an ATP analog and inhibitor of
the kinase activity of the TGF-β type I receptor, or by a
siRNA-based strategy targeting Smad4 [20]. Altogether,
clinical strategies counteracting ZNF217-mediated effects,
either directly (miRNA or siRNA ZNF217 silencing) or
by targeting its possible key-mediators (Aurora-A, FAK,
PI3K/Akt and TGF-β signaling pathways) would represent
valuable alternative approaches for the management of the
subpopulation of ZNF217+ breast tumors possessing poor
prognosis.

a direct repressor of BRCA1, through cooperation with a
histone demethylase [17]. Further studies are expected to
unravel the possible role of ZNF217 in DNA repair defect
or whether ZNF217 polymorphisms belong to the roster of
mutant genes needed to orchestrate tumorigenesis.
Whether ZNF217 interplays with immune
destruction escape, inflammation, angiogenesis or cellular
energetics deregulation remains unknown (Figure 4).
Transcriptomic analyses have however revealed that
deregulated ZNF217 expression is paired with aberrant
expression of enzymes involved in metabolism [20]
and that ZNF217 might interfere with lipid metabolism
[54]. More precisely, ZNF217 might interfere with the
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 [54] recently
implicated in breast cancer progression and metastatic
dissemination [95]. Future studies should provide
new exciting data concerning the role of ZNF217 in

reprogramming energy metabolism and in producing
oncometabolites.
