Abstract
Current therapy of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone
malignancy, is based on a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Multidrug
resistance mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression has been previously
associated with treatment failure and progression of OS, although other mechanisms
may also play a role. We considered the typical acidic extracellular pH (pHe) of
sarcomas, and found that doxorubicin (DXR) cytotoxicity is reduced in P-gp negative
OS cells cultured at pHe 6.5 compared to standard 7.4. Short-time (24–48 hours)
exposure to low pHe significantly increased the number and acidity of lysosomes, and
the combination of DXR with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor targeting lysosomal
acidity, significantly enhanced DXR cytotoxicity. In OS xenografts, the combination
treatment of DXR and omeprazole significantly reduced tumor volume and body weight
loss. The impaired toxicity of DXR at low pHe was not associated with increased
autophagy or lysosomal acidification, but rather, as shown by SNARF staining, with
a reversal of the pH gradient at the plasma membrane (∆pHcm), eventually leading to
a reduced DXR intracellular accumulation. Finally, the reversal of ∆pHcm in OS cells
promoted resistance not only to DXR, but also to cisplatin and methotrexate, and, to
a lesser extent, to vincristine. Altogether, our findings show that, in OS cells, shortterm acidosis induces resistance to different chemotherapeutic drugs by a reversal of
∆pHcm, suggesting that buffer therapies or regimens including proton pump inhibitors
in combination to low concentrations of conventional anticancer agents may offer
novel solutions to overcome drug resistance.

significantly improved, although 30–40% of localized
OS and over 70% of metastatic OS do not respond to
therapy and develop pulmonary metastases [2]. The
mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy has been
extensively investigated in OS [3–5]. Most studies have
focused on pathways modulating cancer cell sensitivity,

such as the transmembrane ATP-dependent efflux pump
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) [3–6], Her-2/ERBB2 [7], the
Bcl-2 family proteins [8], and, more recently, miRNAs
[9, 10]. On this respect, however, the role of tumor
microenvironment (TME), a key player for tumor cell
survival at the primary lesion and the receptive soil for
cancer cell seeding at distant sites for the (pre)-metastatic
niche [11, 12], has been neglected so far. In many cancers
[13–17], including OS [18, 19], a number of TMEdependent factors may play a key role in chemoresistance,
including the modification of the extracellular matrix, the
recruitment of stromal cells, and hypoxia. The hypoxic
TME of OS, an osteogenic malignancy usually arising
in bone, may be particularly relevant for tumor behavior.
In fact, bone is per se a hypoxic tissue with an oxygen
tension between < 1% in hypoxic region and < 6% in
proximity of sinusoidal cavities [20], and it is well known
that hypoxia controls a number of relevant bone tissuespecific activities, including angiogenesis, recruitment
of stem precursors, proliferation, and differentiation of
committed osteogenic elements [21]. Tumor cells cope
with hypoxia by switching from aerobic respiration
to glycolysis, in turn producing lactic acid and causing
extracellular acidosis [22]. In several malignancies, the
increased reliance on glycolysis to produce energy occurs
even in the presence of sufficient oxygen supply [23, 24].
Indeed, the extracellular pH (pHe) of different tumor
types, including sarcomas, ranges from 6.4 to 7.3, whereas
the pHe of normal tissues is in the range of 7.2–7.5 [25].
Locally and acutely, intratumoral pH varies from one
area to another, showing a trend of decrease that in the
long term (chronically) results into an average persistent
intratumoral acidosis. Indeed, pH can locally and rapidly
change due to a short-lived phenomenon, like to apoptosis
of a small group of cells, to temporary hypoxia due to
the disruption of small vessels, or to temporary high
glycolytic activity [26, 27]. As a result, in the tumor
TME, acidosis is both chronic and acute, with different
grading. We have recently demonstrated in sarcomas that
a low pHe is linked to malignant behavior [28, 29]. In
other cancers, acidity has also been associated with drug
resistance [30–32].
In this study, we studied the role of pH regulation
on drug resistance of OS. For this purpose, in wild type
OS cells we investigated doxorubicin (DXR) cytotoxicity
and intracellular accumulation under acidic conditions,
the role of lysosomal acidification and autophagy on drug
resistance, and the effects of lysosomal pH modification
both in vitro and in vivo. We investigated on the effect
of rapid changes in pH on drug effectiveness. Our results
show that, besides P-gp overexpression, extracellular
acidity is another major player of resistance to DXR,
suggesting the use of pH modifiers as novel therapeutic
tools to increase the efficacy and reduce toxicity of
conventional anticancer agents.

The acidic TME of OS is associated with
resistance to DXR
As proof-of-principle that our in vitro models were
representative of the acidic TME of OS, we verified if
the preselected pHe (culture medium at pH 6.5–7.4–8.0)
at the beginning of the culture, with or w/o DXR, was
maintained over the incubation period. We checked the
pH of medium at different time points for all the OS
cell lines included in this study and it was very similar
between the different cell lines. After 72 h, the pHe was
slightly decreased, possibly due to the high number of subconfluent cells. However, the specific pHe values were
stable over the culture period (Figure 1A, representative
values only for HOS cells). As expected, due to its cationic
nature, DXR induced a trend of a slight increase in pHe at
all conditions. In unbuffered medium, HOS cells secreted
an amount of protons that, combined with the 5% of
atmosphere CO2, induced a pHe of around 6.8 (at 48 h:
6.76 ± 0.09, n = 6, Figure 1A).
We then sought to investigate whether the reduced
cytotoxicity of DXR under an acidic TME was present in
OS cells, even if they do not express P-gp, as previously
observed in other cancers [31–33]. Indeed, following
DXR exposure, the percentage of growth inhibition of
OS P-gp negative cells calculated by direct cell counting
significantly correlated with the pH values (Figure 1B).
By indirect viability test, we also found that, at pHe 6.5,
the concentration of DXR needed to obtain 60% of growth
inhibition in the same cells was 10-fold higher than at
pHe 7.4 (Figure 1C). The same type of indirect test was
also used to calculate EC50 of DXR at different pH. EC50
at pH 6.5 was around 2,000–fold higher with respect to
pH 7.4 in P-gp negative cells, whereas the expression
of P-gp in HOS 100-DXR cells that we used as positive
control for chemoresistance (P-gp positive cells) induced
an increase of the EC50 value of only 500-fold in respect
to sensitive (P-gp negative) cells (Table 1). To exclude the
possibility that the reduced DXR cytotoxicity of OS cells
cultured at low pHe was due to cell death promoted by
acidity, we used Annexin-V test. We found no difference
in apoptosis in untreated HOS P-gp negative cells cultured
at acidic pH in respect to neutral pH (Supplementary
Figure S1, CTR), whereas DXR-treated P-gp negative
cells showed a significantly higher induction of apoptosis
under neutral pH in respect to cells cultured at pH 6.5
(Supplementary Figure S1, DXR 50 ng/mL). Interestingly,
culturing sensitive cells (P-gp negative cells) at acidic
pHe for 48 h was sufficient to completely impair DXR
nuclear accumulation (Figure 1D and 1E). Resistance
to DXR mediated by acidic pHe in sensitive cells was
not associated with the induction of P-gp expression by
acidosis since HOS P-gp negative cells were still negative

under standard conditions (Table 2), and this reduced

cytotoxicity of DXR.
We next reasoned to assess the role of lysosomal
acidification on the acid-induced chemoresistance.
The number of lysosomes of HOS cells was increased
and lysosomes appeared also more activated when
cultured in acidic medium, as shown by the presence of
a higher number of residual bodies detected by electron

(Figure 3C). Since upregulation of the autophagy
modulator HMGB1 was reported to mediate DXR
resistance in OS [37], we evaluated the effects of acidosis
on intracellular HMGB1 levels in HOS cells. Both DXR
and acidity per se induced the expression of HMGB1
in HOS cells (Figure 3C and 3D and Supplementary
Figure  S4). Despite this, treatment with DXR did not
affect the autophagic flux in HOS cells in neither of the
pH considered (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S5).
In order to study whether the maintenance of autophagy
in acidic conditions was associated with sensitivity to
DXR in HOS cells, we performed transient siRNAmediated knock-down of Atg5, a gene involved in
autophagosome maturation. After efficient knockdown of
Atg5 (Supplementary Figure S6), cells were exposed to
medium at pH 7.4 or pH 6.5 and treated or not treated
with DXR. Analysis of cell death showed that inhibition
of autophagy does not affect the sensitivity to DXR
under either pHe (Figure 3E). In addition, cells cultured
at acidic pH maintained DXR resistance independently
of autophagy. In conclusion, these findings show that
modulation of autophagy during acidity is not involved in
DXR resistance of OS cells.

microscopy, with respect to the neutral condition
(Figure 2A). To determine lysosomal pH, cells were costained with Lysotracker and Lysosensor fluorescent dyes
that showed selective accumulation in the lysosomal
compartment. Cells cultured under acidic conditions had
a striking increase in the number of acidic vesicles and
thus a lower vesicular pH (Figure 2B). To further extend
these findings, we performed quantitative measurement
of the intensity of the fluorescence emission spectra of
Acridine Orange (AO) uptaken by single cells at different
wavelengths. AO is a probe for measuring pH gradients
across membranes with particular specification to
intravesicular acidification. Indeed, MG-63 cells cultured
in acidic medium showed a shift from the green (alkaline)
to the red (acidic) emission wavelength, indicating
acidification of lysosomes (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the
number of lysosomes per single cell was significantly
increased (Figure 2C). Lysosomal activity is strongly
associated with mTOR activity, and the recovery of the
autophagic flux is associated with the early inhibition
of mTOR phosphorylation, previously reported to occur
during acidic stress [34, 35]. Therefore, we investigated
whether OS sensitive cells under acidic conditions showed
an altered transcriptome related to the mTOR. This,
however, was not the case: in fact, after 24 h we did not
observe any significant variation of the transcripts related
to the mTOR pathway (Supplementary Figure S2).
Staining for the autophagic markers LC3 (green)
and lysotracker (red) showed the presence of LC3-positive
lysosomes (Figure 3A). In order to understand how low pH
modulates autophagy in OS cells, we performed kinetics
analysis of the autophagic flux in HOS cells after 48 h.
During autophagy, the cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) is
lipidated to the autophagosome-associated form (LC3II) which is then degraded after fusion with lysosomes.
Measurement of the autophagic flux is determined by
the accumulation of LC3-II protein in the presence of
the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) and
expressed as the ratio of LC3-II signal intensity in cells
with and without BafA1 and normalized for the actin
signal [36]. Despite a temporary but minor downregulation
of the autophagic flux at 4-8 h, cells were fully competent
for autophagy at 24 and 48 h, as indicated by the similar
accumulation of LC3-II in the presence of BafA1 in
the two pH conditions (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure S3). The ability of HOS cells to maintain a high
self-degradative process after exposure for 24 h at pH 6.5
was also confirmed by using other lysosomal inhibitors

Targeting lysosomal activity enhances the DXR
effectiveness
To confirm that the autophagy-independent
lysosomal activity is involved in DXR response after shortterm acidosis, we used omperazole (OME), a proton pump
inhibitor that targets lysosomal acidification by blocking
vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in sarcoma cells
[29, 38]. Treatment with OME enhanced growth inhibition
promoted by DXR under acidity. Especially in HOS and
MG-63 sensitive cells, DXR treatment showed a significant
effect at lower doses, when used in combination with
OME, with respect to the single treatment (Figure 4A).
Similar results were obtained in vivo in a xenograft
model of OS. When both intraperitoneally administered,
combined treatment with OME (10 mg/kg) enhanced
the cytotoxic effect of DXR (1.5 mg/kg), resulting in a
significantly lower tumor volume and a higher necrotic
index (Figure 4B–4D). Interestingly, mice treated with
the combination of OME and DXR showed a statistically
significant reduced loss of body weight compared to mice
treated with DXR alone (DXR treated group: 20.1 ± 0.6 gr;
OME + DXR treated group: 22.3 ± 0.6 gr; *p < 0.05),
possibly suggesting that OME reduced DXR toxicity.

Altering the pH gradient at the plasma
membrane is a key mechanism of drug resistance

a reversal of the ∆pHcm [33]. To extend this observation,
we used SNARF staining in living cells and observed
a significant alteration of ∆pHcm that would result in an
enhancement of intracellular positive charge with respect
to the extracellular space (Figure 5C). The alteration of
∆pHcm showed a trend of reduction in MG-63 cells and a
significant reduction in Saos-2 sensitive (P-gp negative)
cells when cells were treated with OME (Figure 5C).
Interestingly, we found that the same pattern of an altered
∆pHcm was also present in P-gp expressing resistant OS
cells cultured in a standard medium at pH 7.4, with respect
to the sensitive P-gp negative parental cells also cultured
in standard medium at pH 7.4 (Figure 5D). The use of
the MDR modifier verapamil produced a decrease of this
effect, whereas the incubation with a MDR-1 neutralizing

We then sought to investigate the total amount
of DXR that effectively enters into the OS sensitive
(P-gp negative) cells cultured under acidic conditions
through image analysis (Figure 5A) and flow cytometry
(Figure 5B). A low fluorescent signal of the drug was
detected within the cells at acidic pH in respect to neutral
conditions both at 24 and 48 h (Figure 5B). This finding
suggests that the major obstacle for DXR effectiveness
under short-term acidosis is its entrance into the cell
through the plasma membrane. This is possibly due
either to a phenomenon known as the partition theory, or
through a change of membrane stiffness, both related to

antibody significantly impaired this effect, completely
restoring the original phenotype (Figure 5E). These
results suggest that chemoresistance mediated also by
P-gp activity is partially due to pHi regulation. Finally,
we found that drug resistance promoted by short-term
acidosis is not specific only to DXR, since the treatment
with methotrexate, vincristine, and at a lower extent with
cisplatin was significantly impaired by low pH (Figure 6).
As a control we used P-gp expressing cells in which a

very high resistance to DXR and vincristine, and only a
low resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate were present.
Notably, drug resistance conferred by short-term acidosis
was dramatically higher for methotrexate, and less evident
with vincristine. In the first case, it is likely that BCRP
cancer resistance proteins that efflux methotrexate out of
the cells and that are expressed by OS cells [39], transport
more efficiently the drug at low pH [40]. Regarding
vincristine, the mild effect of pH 6.5 on resistance is

possibly due to the very acidic pKa of the drug (between
3.5 and 4.5) that is thus less subject to the reversal of
∆pHcm .

inhibition of OS sensitive (P-gp negative) cells induced
by DXR was significantly impaired. In fact, at pH 6.5,
a 10-fold increase of DXR concentration was necessary
to achieve the same level of growth inhibition detected
at pH 7.4, and the amount of drug that accumulated into
the nucleus, the main target site of DXR activity, was
significantly reduced.
Therefore, the effect of pH on DXR resistance did
not rely on P-gp expression, and might be attributed to
different mechanisms. We observed a reduced replication
rate at pHe 6.5, possibly due to a block in cell cycle
[43], and this might interfere with the effectiveness of
an antiproliferative agent, like DXR, blocking type II
topoisomerase activity [44]. Another possible explanation
concerns lysosomal acidification. Acidic lysosomes can
sequester weakly basic molecules, like DXR, to an extent
that is directly related to the level of acidity [45, 46]. The
compartmentalization into the lysosomes might derive
from the transfer of DXR from the cytosol, or from a

DISCUSSION
Since the time of discovery of MDR mediated by
P-gp expression [41], the concept of chemoresistance
has been extensively revised and expanded into two
major types. Biochemical resistance is mediated by the
upregulation of drug efflux or metabolic pathways, such as
MDR-1 or BCRP. Moreover, physiological resistance may
also occur as a consequence of poor perfusion, hypoxia,
and/or acidity [42].
In this study, we mimicked the acidic conditions of
extracellular space that are commonly detected in OS as
a result of the significant anomalies in energy metabolism
by using in vitro cell culture medium buffered at pH 6.5.
Under these conditions, we observed that the growth

direct endocytotic process [47]. Compared to standard
conditions, in OS cells cultured for a few hours in acidic
medium, we found a higher number of larger lysosomes
and, as already demonstrated for breast cancer cells [46],
the lysosomal compartment was also more acidic.
Closely associated to lysosomal acidification,
autophagy is an adaptation mechanism that cancer cells
adopt when exposed to an adverse microenvironmental
conditions, such as acidity [35, 48] and anticancer agents,
including DXR [37]. After 24 h exposure to acidity,
however, we did not observe changes in the expression
of autophagy-related genes. Such a short endpoint was
selected to parallel the rapid nuclear uptake of DXR.

Although treatment with DXR or with acidic pHe
increased HMGB1 expression, the inhibition of autophagy
via knock-down of Atg5 did not alter the sensitivity of
OS cells to DXR at any pHe condition, further suggesting
that autophagy-mediated DXR resistance is not a general
phenomenon in OS cells.
We further investigated the role of lysosomes in
OS chemoresistance under short-term acidic conditions,
and independently of autophagy. We have previously
shown that treatment with OME, a gastric H+/K+-ATPase
inhibitor that targets also the lysosomal proton pump
V-ATPase [49], alkalinizes lysosomal pH in sarcoma
cells [29, 38]. Here, we reasoned to test the effects of

OME on DXR sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo. After
pretreatment with OME, the growth inhibition of DXR
was significantly increased. The combination of OME
with DXR induced a growth rate reduction at a 10-fold
lower concentration of DXR. In the xenograft model of
OS, when combined with OME, treatment with DXR
produced a significant reduction of tumor volume and
an increase of necrosis. Most importantly, these effects
were obtained with a low concentration (1.5 mg/kg) of
DXR with respect to the dosage commonly used in OS
xenografts (2.5 mg/kg) [50]. DXR as a single treatment
at the same concentration did not produce any effect.
Such concentration was calculated as 1/6 of the minimum
dose used for a therapeutic regimen in human patients
(60–90 mg/m2, corresponding to 9–14 mg/kg in a child
of 24 kg, with a height of 120 cm) [1]. The combined
treatment also had a positive impact on the systemic
toxicity associated with DXR treatment. In fact, mouse
body weight was less affected with respect to DXR alone
both at 1.5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg (data not shown).
In summary, the reduced toxicity of DXR in
OS sensitive (P-gp negative) cells under low pHe was
independent of autophagy but apparently associated with

an increased lysosomal acidification. Notably, this type
of resistance develops within hours, in contrast to the
expression of P-gp that occurs, according to the canonical
model of MDR, after months of continuous exposure to
DXR. To verify that resistance to DXR under short-term
exposure to acidity is actually due to drug accumulation
into lysosomes, we observed the intracellular fluorescence
of DXR after 5–10 min of incubation. Surprisingly, DXR
did not accumulate into the cell, a minor portion being
compartmentalized into lysosomes. The high pH gradient
generated between the acidic extracellular compartment
and the alkaline cytosolic space is sufficient to affect
the permeability to weak cationic drugs at the plasma
membrane [51]. This occurs because uncharged, organic
free bases are more permeable than their protonated
charged counterparts and establish equal concentrations
on both sides of the membrane. We therefore measured
the difference between the extracellular and the cytosolic
pH (pHe-pHi, ∆pHcm) at different pHe. Although the pHi
was mildly acidified by the extracellular milieu, the net
result was a strong alteration of ∆pHcm with a reversal of
net charges. Notably, in Saos-2 cells, pre-treatment with
OME slightly reduced this trend. Only a few reports have

Concluding remarks

linked pHi regulation also to drug resistance mediated by
P-gp expression. MDR cells have been reported to have a
more alkaline pHi [32, 52], and the magnitude of plasma
membrane electrical potential decreases along with the
increase of expression of P-gp [53]. According to this
hypothesis, P-gp-mediated effects depend also on an altered
regulation of ion transporters and signal transduction
pathways (i.e., pH and membrane potential, key features
necessary for the correct setting the biophysical parameters
of the cells) [54]. In this context, P-gp has been suggested
to work as a chloride channel, although it is yet unclear
whether it might physically form a channel-like structure
or rather regulate nearby anion transporters involved in the
maintenance of pHi [53, 55, 56]. Here, we confirmed that
P-gp expression in P-gp overexpressing OS cells obtained
by continuous exposure to DXR [5] induces an alteration
of ∆pHcm, that is partially reverted by verapamil. Moreover,
we further verified that the anti P-gp monoclonal antibody
MRK16, known to revert the MDR phenotype [57]
completely abolished the ∆pHcm decrease observed under
acidity. Therefore, according to our data, a change in ∆pHcm
is necessary to induce chemoresistance, either by shortterm acidosis or by the long term drug exposure leading
to P-gp expression. On this regard, the reversed ∆pHcm has
been recently shown to interfere with the passage of drugs
across the lipid bilayer of the cells, by altering the fluidity,
the relative lipid density, and the surface tension of each of
the leaflets within the membrane [33]. Short-term acidosis
induced chemoresistance not only to DXR, but also to
methotrexate, vincristine and, at a lesser extent, to cisplatin,
other drugs commonly included in the standard therapeutic
protocol for OS.

Altogether, our data provide evidence that the
chemoresistant phenotype of OS is dependent on an
inverted or altered ∆pHcm. This might rapidly result from
the acidification of the TME (Figure 7B), or derive from
the induction of the expression of P-gp (Figure 7C). In this
view, buffer therapies or proton pump inhibitors that block
the abnormal ∆pHcm could be used in combination with
standard anticancer agents. This hypothesis is supported
by the encouraging results obtained in a pilot clinical study
of human OS by the addition of esomeprazole to standard
chemotherapy regimens [58]. Finally, the consistent
evidence that changes of pHe strongly impact on the
cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs should be taken into
account. We therefore propose that in vitro IC50 assays
for anticancer agents in sarcomas should always include a
condition with an acidic medium in the range of pH 6.56.8 to mimic the actual conditions of TME.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
HOS, Saos-2, MG-63, and 143B human OS cell
lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection, cultured in RPMI plus 20 units/mL penicillin,
100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FCS at pH 7.4
(complete medium), and incubated at 37°C in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere. In assays with different pH, cells
were seeded in complete medium, and after 24 h media
were changed. New media were set at a specific pH by

Figure 7: ∆pHcm at the plasma membrane is an important player in OS chemoresistance. (A) When OS cells growth in a
microenvironment with pHe 7.4 and with an unaffected system to maintain the pHi, DXR accumulates into the nucleus; (B) when OS cells
growth in a microenvironment with pHe around 6.5, the ∆pHcm is reverted and DXR does enter into the cell. Only a very small fraction
of DXR reaches the cytoplasm, and is immediately sequestered into lysosomes that, under this condition, are even more acidic; (C) when
OS cells growth in a microenvironment with pHe 7.4 and express Pgp, the system to maintain the pHi is altered, membrane potential is
reduced, and lysosomes are more acidic. As a result, although DXR can reach the cytoplasm, it is immediately sequestered into lysosomes.

number was measured by an acid phosphatase assay as
described above. The experiment was repeated twice in
quadruplicate.

using different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate
needed to preset pH in 5% CO2 atmosphere, according
to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. At the end-point
of each experiment, the final pH in the supernatant was
always measured by a digital pH-meter (pH 301, HANNA
Instruments). To obtain HOS 100-DXR cells and MG-63
MDR cells we continuously exposed parental cell lines
to stepwise increases in DXR concentration (10-30-100
ng/mL for HOS and 10-30 ng/mL for MG-63, Sigma).
Approximately 2–3 weeks (4-5 passages) were required
to establish adequate growth at each DXR concentration.

DXR uptake
According to the previously described method [60],
cells were seeded at low density in a glass-bottom Petri
dish (Inco), and incubated for 48 h in complete medium
at different pH. Then, the medium was changed at the
respective pH with DXR 10 μg/mL for 5 or 15 min. Cells
were washed with PBS and maintained with drug-free
complete medium at the respective pH. For quantitative
determination of intranuclear DXR concentration, the
laser (Exc wavelength 457.9 nm) was focused for 1 sec
with a pinhole of 54 μm to the nucleus of cells to obtain
fluorescence emission spectra. The drug concentration in
the nuclei of living cells were obtained from the specific
spectra contribution of DXR (Emi 560–590 nm). The
analysis was performed using a TiE spectral confocal laser
microscope (A1R, Nikon) equipped with a DS-QIMc-U2
12 bit camera. We measured the fluorescence of 25 nuclei
(within the nuclear perimeter) of 5 different random
optical fields. DXR nuclear uptake was expressed as the
mean of the sum of intensities divided by the nuclear
area. The same experimental conditions and settings for
confocal microscopy were also used for the acquisition of
3D intensity embossed images.

Growth assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (100,000 cells/
well) in complete medium. After 24 h, the medium was
changed with new complete medium at different pH,
or with complete medium without sodium bicarbonate
(unbuffered medium, UB), with or w/o DXR (15 ng/mL).
The pH in UB condition, measured at all time points and
for each cell line, was always 6.75 ± 0.07. Cell growth
was evaluated by direct cell counting using the eritrosin
dye (Sigma). Growth inhibition was obtained in respect to
the untreated condition at the respective pH, and at a time
point just after the specific doubling time at the considered
pH (for HOS: 24 h at pH 7.4 and 8, 48 h at pH 6.5 and
6.75; for Saos-2: 48 h at all the pH; for MG-63: 42 h at pH
7.4 and 8, and 72 h at pH 6.5 and 6.75). The experiments
were repeated three times, with two replicates for each
assay.
To calculate the IC50 values for DXR or to evaluate
the growth inhibition of DXR treatment combined with
pre-treatment with the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole
(OME), cells were seeded in 96-well plates (4,000 cells/
well) in complete medium. After 24 h, the medium was
changed with new medium at different pH, with or w/o
DXR (0-10-30-100-1000 ng/mL). For the combined
treatment, 2 h before the change of media with DXR, cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with medium 0.1
% FCS with or w/o OME (210 μM, Sigma). After 72 h
since the addition of DXR, the cell number was measured
by an acid phosphatase assay, as previously described
[59]. Briefly, the culture medium was removed, wells
were washed with PBS, and 100 μl of buffer containing
0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and
5 mM p-nitrophenil phosphate (Sigma) was added. After
3 h at 37°C, the reaction was stopped with the addition
of 10 μl of a 1 N NaOH, and color development was
assayed at 405  nm using a microplate reader (Tecan
Infinite F200pro). The experiment was repeated twice in
quadruplicate.
Similarly, to evaluate the percentage of inhibition
of viability, cells were seeded in complete medium,
and after additional 24 h, the medium was replaced
with the respective conditions added with DXR
100 ng/mL, or Cysplatin 250 ng/mL, or Methotrexate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blotting
HOS cells were seeded in complete medium.
After 24 h the medium was changed with new medium
at different pH with or w/o DXR (10–100 mg/mL) for
1 month to determine the level of P-gp expression. The
medium was changed every 3–4 d, and confluent cells
were trypsinized. Cells were treated in ice with 400 of lysis
buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mm
MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1%
PMSF, 0.2 mM Na orthovanadate and 1% aprotinin, all
from Sigma]. Protein concentration was determined with
the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Total protein was
separated on 6% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
into nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked
with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST and probed with the
monoclonal P-gp (clone D-11), or TATA binding protein
(TBP) rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The
secondary antibody was an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase that was visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents
(Pierce). For the analysis of autophagy flux in HOS
cells, PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare) were used and
incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal
LC3B (Cell Signaling Technology), monoclonal β-actin
(ACTB, clone AC-15) (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal ATG5

Total RNA was extracted using guanidinium
thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform from cell cultured
under acidic (pH 6.5) or standard conditions (pH 7.4)
for 24 h, and quantified by Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
RIN (RNA Integrity Number) and A260/A280 ratio
of the prepared total RNA were all 10, and over 1.8,
respectively. The library of template molecules for high
throughput DNA sequencing was converted from the total
RNA using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The library was
quantified with Bioanalyzer (Agilent) following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Library (7 pM) was subjected
to cluster amplification to cluster generation on a Single
Read Flow Cell v4 with a cluster generation instrument
(Illumina). Sequencing was performed on a Genome
Analyzer GAIIx for 76 cycles using Cycle Sequencing
v4 regents (Illumina). Image analysis and base calling
were performed using Off-Line Basecaller Software
1.6 (Illumina). Reads were aligned using ELAND v2 of
CASAVA Software 1.7 with the sequence data sets. Human
genome build 19 (hg19) were downloaded from University
of California, Santa Cruz genome browser (http://genome.
ucsc.edu/) as the analytic reference. Transcript coverage
for every gene locus was calculated from the total number
passing filter reads that mapped, by ELAND-RNA, to
exons. These analyses were performed using default
parameters. The advanced analysis for quantification
with Quantile normalization algorithm was performed
using Avadis NGS software (version1.5, Strand Scientific
Intelligence Inc.). Filtering was performed using default
parameters. All new data were deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/
GenBank under accession number DRA DRA004087.

Ultrastructural analysis
HOS cells cultured under acidic (pH 6.5) or standard
(pH 7.4) conditions were washed in PBS and fixed with
2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH
7.4 (Sigma) for 30 min at R°T, scraped, and pelletted at
1,300 g for 20 min. Pellets were further fixed for 2 h.
After washing in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, samples were
post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer
(Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon
resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with tannic acid,
uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with a Zeiss
EM 109 transmission electron microscope. Image were
captured using a Nikon digital camera (Dmx 1200F) and
the ACT-1 software.

Lysosomal pH assays
Cells were cultured in complete medium at different
pH for 48 h and then analyzed. Lysosensor staining:
labeling and tracking of acidic organelles in living cells
was performed by incubation with 1 μM LysoSensor
Green DND-189 and 50 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99
(Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) in medium at the
respective pH. After 30 min at 37°C, cells were washed
with fresh medium and observed by confocal microscopy
(Nikon Eclipse E600).
Confocal spectral analysis: the emission spectra
of the pH-sensitive dye AO was used to measure pH
variations in acidic organelles, as previously described
[61]. MG-63 cells were incubated with AO (0.5 μg/mL,
Sigma) in medium at the respective pH for 15 min. After
washing, x,y emission spectra from confocal sections of
single living cells were recorded using a confocal laser
microspectrofluorimeter (Nikon, TI) equipped with an
argon-ion laser. Cells were focused with a ×40, 1.3 NA
objective (S Fluor, Nikon), excited at 457 nm and the
resulting fluorescence emission in the 500–700 nm range
was collected. For intracellular measurements of AO
emission the pinhole size was fixed to a diameter of 54
μm. To characterize the profile of AO emission spectra,
the red band contribution (R%) within the whole emission
spectrum was calculated as follows: R%=100* I655/ (I655
+ I530) where I655 and I530 are the green (520–540 nm) and
the red (645-665 nm) integrated emission intensities,
respectively. The R% was calculated for all the lysosomes
within a single cell, and the average R% of lysosomes of
single cells was considered. Average of the total number
of all the lysosomes per single cell that were detectable
by confocal microscopy analysis and AO staining was
calculated out of 20 cells.

Immunofluorescence
Before fixation, cells were incubated for 24 h
at different pH, and then incubated with Lysotracker
(0.25 μM) in medium at the respective pH for 30 min
at 37°C. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3%
paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 300 mM sucrose
(Sigma) for 20 min at 22°C. After washing with PBS,
permeabilization was performed with 0.1% Triton X-100
for 5 min. Then, cells were incubated with the anti-LC3B
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and with a solution
containing anti-mouse Alexa green 488 nm (Molecular
Probes, Life Technologies), and Hoechst 33258 (1.25
μg/mL, Sigma) for the nuclear staining, and observed
by confocal microscopy (Nikon TI-E). The staining was
repeated two times.

ensure that mice received a constant dose of OME and
DXR. Treatments were repeated every 4 days and mice
were sacrificed 18 days after tumor inoculation. Tumor
size was estimated at every pharmacological treatment
with a caliper and the weight was calculated by using the
formula: tumor volume [mm3] = (length [mm] × width2
[mm2])/2 [62]. For histological analysis, tumor xenografts
were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. 5 µm
sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. The area of
necrosis was quantified by NIS element image analysis
software (Nikon). The Animal Ethics Committee of
Modena has approved all the experimental protocols.

After overnight incubation the medium was replaced with
medium buffered at pH 7.4 or at pH 6.5 and cells were
collected at different time points (4, 8, 24 and 48 h) after
exposure to fresh media. For each time point, cells were
treated or not with 50 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for
2 h before collection. In some experiments, the lysosomal
inhibitors pepstatin A and E64d were used at 10 mg/
ml. Analysis of the effects of DXR where performed by
adding the drug (100 nM) for 24 h in the presence or
absence of BafA1. The use of BafA1 to block lysosomal
acidification was performed in order to analyze the rate of
LC3 and SQTM1 degradation, indicative of the autophagic
flux [36].

DXR intracellular content by flow cytometry
quantification

ATG5 silencing
HOS cells were seeded in 6-wells plates (50,000
cells/well) in medium without antibiotics. The next day,
cells were transfected with 25 nM siRNA for ATG5
(Dharmacon RNA Technologies siGENOME SMART
pool) and siRNA SCR (scrambled siRNA, control) using
DharmaFECT-4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon),
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The next day,
the medium was changed with fresh complete medium
buffered at different pH (7.4 and 6.5), with or without
DXR (100 ng/mL). After 36 h, cells were collected and
analyzed for apoptosis by Annexin V staining. Cells for
Western blot analysis were collected at the same time.
Four replicates were made for each assay.

HOS cells were seeded in 6-well plates (50,000
cells/well) in complete medium. The next day, the medium
was changed with fresh medium buffered at different pH
(7.4 and 6.5), with or w/o DXR (50 ng/mL). After 24 and
48 h, cells were collected and at least 10,000 cells/sample
were analyzed by flow citometry. The mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) in the FL2 channel was evaluated by the
DXR red fluorescence.

pH gradient at the plasma membrane
Cytosolic intracellular pH (pHi) of OS cells was
measured by using carboxy-SNARF-1 and confocal
microspectrofluorometry (Nikon, TI). Cells were seeded
into glass Petri dishes and incubated for 48 h in medium at
different pH. At the end, cells were additionally incubated
in acidic pH (pH 6.5) for HOS, Saos-2, and MG-63 cells
or in complete medium for HOS 100-DXR cells, with
OME (210 mM) and Verapamil (500 μM), single treatment
or combined, or with the MRK16 anti-MDR-1 antibody
(10 m/mL). At the time of the analysis, cells were then
treated with medium at the respective pH containing
10  μM carboxy-SNARF-1 of the acetoxymethyl ester
form (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) at 37°C with
5% CO2 for 30 min. Medium was replaced again with
medium at the respective pH and Petri dishes were placed
in an incubator (OkoLab), on the stage of the confocal
microscope. We used an excitation laser of 514 nm
wavelength (Argon) and a S Plan Fluor ELWD 40X lend
(Nikon). The resulting fluorescence emissions at 644 nm
and at 594 nm wavelengths were collected. Several regions
of interest (ROI) were then randomly selected excluding
nuclear regions. The emission ratio was calibrated using
solutions (110 mM KCl, 25 mM KHCO3, 11 mM glucose,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, Sigma) with
varying pH (pH 6.5–8.0) that contained 10 μM nigericin
(K+/H+ ionophore, Sigma). In this case, cells were allowed
to adapt for at least 20 min before pHi measurements
began. The fluorescence emission ratio (644 nm/594 nm)
was calculated and used to estimate cytoplasmic pH from

Apoptosis assay
We evaluated apoptotic cell death by using
Annexin-V staining (FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection
Kit, BD Pharmingen) and by collecting green fluorescence
in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson)
using the Cellquest Pro software. At least 10,000 cells/
sample were acquired and analyzed. The experiments were
repeated five times, with two replicates for each assay.

In vivo studies
NOD/SCID animals were housed and maintained in
a pathogen-free environment. 143B human cells (1 × 106)
were subcutaneously injected with the reduced growth
factor matrigel (BD, Bioscience) in the flank of 5 weeks
old male mice (Charles River Laboratories International).
Four days after the inoculation, mice were randomly
separated into groups and assigned to pharmacological
treatments (for each group n = 7). Both OME and
DXR were reconstituted in saline solution and injected
intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg, respectively).
Mice received saline solution, OME, DXR or a
combination of OME and DXR, the latter being injected
2 h after OME treatment. Weights were taken daily during
treatment, and drug concentrations were recalculated to
