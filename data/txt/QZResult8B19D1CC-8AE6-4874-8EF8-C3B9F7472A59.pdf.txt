BACKGROUND: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group PA.3 (NCIC CTG PA.3) was a phase 3 study
(n ¼ 569) that demonstrated benefits for overall survival and progression-free survival with the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with advanced
pancreatic carcinoma (APC). Mutation status of the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)
and EGFR gene copy number (GCN) were evaluated as predictive markers in 26% of patients who had tumor samples
available for analysis. METHODS: KRAS mutation status was evaluated by direct sequencing of exon 2, and EGFR
GCN was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The results were correlated with survival,
which was the primary endpoint of the trial. RESULTS: KRAS analysis was successful in 117 patients, and EGFR FISH
analysis was successful in 107 patients. KRAS mutations were identified in 92 patients (78.6%), and EGFR amplification or high polysomy (FISH-positive results) was identified in 50 patients (46.7%). The hazard ratio of death between
gemcitabine/erlotinib and gemcitabine/placebo was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-1.57) for patients with
wild-type KRAS and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.68-1.66) for patients with mutant KRAS (P value for interaction ¼ .38), and the
hazard ratio was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.34-1.07) for FISH-negative patients and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.49-1.65) for FISH-positive
patients (P value for interaction ¼ .32). CONCLUSIONS: In a molecular subset analysis of patients from NCIC CTG
PA.3, EGFR GCN and KRAS mutation status were not identified as markers predictive of a survival benefit from the

Standard treatment for the systemic management of unresectable pancreatic cancer is single-agent gemcitabine.1
Studies that have investigated a range of doublets, including combinations of gemcitabine with cytotoxics as well as novel
biologics, have failed to improve on the survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.2,3 Recently, the phase 3
National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study PA.3 (NCIC CTG PA.3) demonstrated modest
improvements in both overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.99; P ¼ .038)
and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92; P ¼ .004) in the treatment arm that received combined erlotinib and gemcitabine.4
In that trial, the presence of significant rash (grade 2) was predictive of a greater survival advantage and led us to
explore potential molecular markers that were predictive of benefit. There has been great interest in the identification of

molecular markers that can predict response and survival
benefit from drugs that target the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), particularly in nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Reports of the predictive power of EGFR protein levels, as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC),
on response and/or survival benefit in patients with
NSCLC have been inconsistent.5,6 In PA.3, EGFR protein expression, as determined by IHC, was not associated
with tumor response, disease stability, or an improvement
in outcome.4 In patients with NSCLC, EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) domain-activating mutations and EGFR gene
copy number (GCN) also have been reported as predictive
of response and/or a survival benefit from EGFR TKI
therapy.7,8 Genomic analyses in pancreatic cancer cell
lines and pancreatic tumor specimens have mapped 1 of
most frequent amplifications to the 7p12.3 region in
which the EGFR gene is located.9 More recently, mutation of the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (KRAS) has emerged as a strong marker for lack
of efficacy of antibody therapy directed against EGFR in
patients with colorectal cancer, in whom the benefit
appears to be limited exclusively to patients with wildtype KRAS.10,11 A similar indication also was reported for
patients with NSCLC who received erlotinib or gefintib,12-14 although more recent results have been inconsistent.15 KRAS mutations are common in pancreatic ductal
carcinoma, and various reports have cited frequencies
ranging from 50% up to 90%. Greater than 95% of
these mutations are on codon 12 or 13, and a few involve
codon 59 or 61.16-19
To clarify the roles of KRAS and EGFR as predictive
biomarkers in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
who receive erlotinib, we analyzed archival tumor samples
for EGFR GCN and KRAS mutation status in a subset of
treated and control patients who were enrolled on the
double-blind, placebo-controlled PA-3 study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NCIC CTG PA.3 trial was an international study
that randomized patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
to receive either gemcitabine in combination with erlotinib or placebo as first-line treatment. The primary endpoint was OS, and the secondary endpoints were PFS,
response rate (RR), response duration, toxicity, and quality of life.
The study randomized 569 patients, and a separate
consent was obtained to allow participation in correlative
analyses on archival tumor samples. Archival formalin-

5600

fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks or unstained
slides either from tumor biopsies or from surgical resections were collected successfully from 181 patients. Before
molecular assays, 2 study pathologists (G.d.C.S. and
M.S.T.) reviewed the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide
and verified the presence of adequate tumor tissue; 35
samples were identified as inadequate for additional studies. Therefore, 146 samples were submitted for analysis of
the KRAS mutation status and EGFR GCN.

DNA Isolation and KRAS Mutation Assay
DNA was isolated from the entire 5-mm tissue section of
each sample that had >50% tumor cellularity. Sample
sections that had <50% tumor cellularity or uneven tumor cell distribution were macrodissected to enrich the
tumor cells for DNA extraction. After deparaffinization
with graded concentrations of xylene and alcohol, the tissues were digested overnight with proteinase K. The,
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) and verified with electrophoresis
and spectrophotometry.
Polymerase chair reaction (PCR) was used to generate
a 230-base-pair amplicon using the Optimase polymerase
(Transgenomic Inc., Omaha, Neb) and primers that were
designed to amplify mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon
2 of the KRAS gene (accession number L00045). After purification with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen),
bidirectional sequencing was performed using an ABI BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) on the ABI PRIM 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). ABI PRISM 3100
Sequencing Analysis Software (Applied Biosystems) was used
to analyze the resulting data. Alignments were performed
using BLAST searches against the GenBank database.
Samples with inconclusive and negative results by
sequencing were subjected to confirmation using the
SURVEYOR digestion and fragment analysis with
denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography
(dHPLC) (Transgenomic Inc.). Heteroduplexes and
homoduplexes of the PCR amplicons were generated
using the denaturing and reannealing procedures
described by the manufacturer. Heteroduplexes were
cleaved by the SURVEYOR enzyme at the site of mismatch. Digested fragments were detected by fluorescence
using WAVE Optimized HS staining solution, and analysis was carried out using dHPLC (WAVE HS System;
Transgenomic Inc.).

EGFR Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
The FFPE tissue sections (5 lm) were placed in a dry oven
at 56 C for 24 hours, deparaffinized, and dehydrated in
100% ethanol. Air-dried slides were incubated in
2  standard saline citrate (SSC), pH 7.0, at 75 C for 20
minutes and digested with 0.25 mg/mL proteinase K
(Roche, Laval, Quebec, Canada) at 45 C for 25 minutes
followed by 2  SSC, pH 7.0, at room temperature and
dehydration in an ascending ethanol series for 2 minutes
each. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were
performed using dual-color probes: the LSI EGFR probe
(Vysis Inc., Downer’s Grove, Ill) specific for the EGFR
locus (7p12) labeled with SpectrumOrange, and the chromosome enumeration probe 7 (CEP7) chromosome 7
centromere probe (7p11.1-q11.1) labeled with SpectrumGreen. Probe was added to the hybridization areas, coverslipped, and sealed with rubber cement. Codenaturation
was carried out at 80 C for 10 minutes in a microprocessor-controlled system (Hybrite; Vysis Inc.), and the
sections were hybridized at 37 C overnight. Posthybridization washes consisted of 0.1  SSC, pH 7.0, containing
1.5 M urea for 30 minutes at 45 followed by 2 minutes
in 2  SSC, pH 7.0, at room temperature. After ethanol
dehydration, the slides were air dried in a dark chamber,
and this was followed by chromatin counterstaining with
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (0.15 mg/mL in
Vectashield mounting medium; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif).
Analyses were done by 1 observer (O.L.) using
an AxioImager System fluorescence microscope (Zeiss,
Gottingen, Germany). A minimum of 50 nonoverlapping
tumor cell nuclei was scored according to the number of
red (EGFR) and green (CEP7) signals observed and classified into 6 categories, as described previously.20 The observer was blinded to treatment allocation and clinical
data.
Statistical Analysis
All patients who were randomized and had KRAS mutation status or EGFR FISH data available were included,
respectively, in the analyses of correlation between outcomes and KRAS mutation status or EGFR FISH, categorized as high and low. OS, the primary endpoint of this
study, was defined as the time from randomization until
death from any cause. The survival of patients in each
KRAS mutation group, EGFR FISH group, and/or treatment group was summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves.
The differences between these groups were compared
using the log-rank test, and the hazard ratio (HR) and its

95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated based on a
Cox regression model with a single covariate. To assess
whether KRAS mutation or EGFR FISH status was an
independent prognostic factor for patients who received
gemcitabine/placebo, a multivariate Cox regression model
was fitted to data from patients on the gemcitabine/placebo treatment arm. The model included the following
covariates: sex (men vs women), age (>60 years vs 60
years), and ethnicity (white vs others). A Cox model with
treatment, KRAS or EGFR status, and their interaction as
covariates was used to assess the interaction between treatment and KRAS mutation or EGFR gene copy status. All
reported P values were 2-sided and were not adjusted for
multiple testing.

RESULTS
In the dataset that included all patients who were randomized to PA.3, 488 deaths were observed over a median
follow-up of 16 months (range, 11-17 months). The molecular analysis subset has had 93 deaths over a similar period of median follow-up (16 months; range, 11-17
months).
KRAS analysis failed in 16 patient samples, and 13
samples yielded indeterminate results; thus, results were
available from 117 patients. For the EGFR FISH analysis,
results were obtained from 107 patients: 25 patient samples had assay failure, and 14 patient samples had insufficient material. Both EGFR FISH and KRAS mutation
status were known in 86 patients.
There were a few statistically significant differences
in baseline characteristics between the cohorts with known
and unknown KRAS (n ¼ 117) and EGFR (n ¼ 107) status (Table 1). There was a significantly higher proportion
of resectability at first presentation in both the ‘‘KRAS
known’’ group and the ‘‘EGFR known’’ group, and a
lower percentage of patients had a very good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0) in the
‘‘KRAS known’’ group. Treatment assignment was similar
across the ‘‘KRAS known’’ and ‘‘KRAS unknown’’ groups
and across the ‘‘EGFR known’’ and ‘‘EGFR unknown’’
groups, and median survival also was similar across groups
(Table 1, Fig. 1A,B). Patients in the ‘‘KRAS known’’
group who received gemcitabine/erlotinib had an OS similar to that of patients who received gemcitabine/placebo
(HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.67-1.47; P ¼ .96). Patients in the
‘‘EGFR known’’ group who received gemcitabine/erlotinib
had a (statistically nonsignificant) better survival than
patients who received gemcitabine/placebo (HR, 0.73;
95% CI, 0.49-1.10; P ¼ .14).

Frequency of KRAS Mutation and EGFR Gene
Copy Changes
KRAS mutation was identified in 92 of 117 patients
(78.6%). Among those 92 patients, the distribution of mutations was as follows: 19 patients had a codon 12 cytosine,
guanine, thymine (CGT) (K12-CGT) mutation; 46 patients
had a codon 12 guanine, adenine, thymine (GAT) (K12GAT) mutation; 20 patients had a K12-GTT mutation; 6
patients had a K12-TGT mutation; and 1 patient had a
K13-GAC mutation. There were no significant differences
in baseline characteristics between patients who had mutated
KRAS and patients who had wild-type KRAS with respect to
sex, ethnicity, age, or performance status (Table 2).
For EGFR FISH analyses, 107 patients were grouped
into 18 patients who had amplification, 32 patients who had
high polysomy, 22 patients who had low polysomy, 5
patients who had high trisomy, 13 patients who had low trisomy, and 17 patients who had disomy. Samples with either

5602

amplification or high polysomy were classified as high EGFR
GCN (FISH-positive), and the remaining samples were classified as low EGFR GCN (FISH-negative). This classification was based on previous studies demonstrating that high
EGFR GCN was a predictor of greater response rates and
clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC who received treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib.6,20 Therefore, 50 of 107
patients (46.7%) from the PA.3 study who had results available were classified as EGFR FISH-positive. Baseline characteristics were similar between the FISH-positive and FISHnegative groups except for higher percentage of East-Asian
patients in the FISH-positive group (18%) compared with
the FISH-negative group (3.5%; P ¼ .007) (Table 2).

placebo, the median OS for EGFR FISH-positive patients
was 5.32 months (95% CI, 3.12-8.54), and the median
OS for FISH-negative patients was 6.70 months (95%
CI, 4.27-8.90). Similar to KRAS mutation status, EGFR
high GCN was not prognostic for OS (HR, 1.07; 95%
CI, 0.58-1.97; P ¼ .83) after adjusting for sex, age, and
ethnicity. The coexistence of both aberrations did not
affect OS (Table 3).
Predictive Value of KRAS Mutation
Among the patients with wild-type KRAS, the median OS
was 6.1 months (95% CI, 5.2-7.6 months) in the gemcitabine/erlotinib group and 4.5 months (95% CI, 1.9-11.2
months) in the gemcitabine/placebo group (HR, 0.66;
95% CI, 0.28-1.57; P ¼ .34) (Fig. 1C). Among the
patients with mutant KRAS, the median OS was 6.0
months (95% CI, 5.2-7.8 months) in the gemcitabine/
erlotinib group and 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.9-9.6

5604

months) in the gemcitabine/placebo group (HR, 1.07;
95% CI, 0.68-1.66; P ¼ .78) (Fig. 1D). There was no significant interaction with OS between KRAS status and
treatment arm (P ¼ .38).
Predictive Value of EGFR GCN
Among FISH-negative patients, the median OS was 8.41
months (95% CI, 6.47-11.47 months) for the gemcitabine/erlotinib group compared with 6.70 months (95%
CI, 4.27-8.90 months) for the gemcitabine/placebo
group (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.34-1.07; P ¼ .08) (Fig. 1E).
Among FISH-positive patients, a benefit from erlotinib
was not apparent: The median OS was 5.29 months
(95% CI, 5.16-7.59 months) and 5.32 months (95% CI,
3.12-8.54 months) in the gemcitabine/erlotinib and
gemcitabine/placebo groups, respectively (HR, of 0.90;
95% CI, 0.49-1.65; P ¼ .73) (Fig. 1F). There was no significant interaction with OS between FISH status and
treatment received (P ¼ .32).

DISCUSSION
The current results do not indicate that either KRAS
mutation status or EGFR high gene copy is a predictive
marker for therapeutic response to erlotinib therapy. In
the subset of PA.3 patients, approximately 80% had
mutated KRAS, almost 50% of tumors demonstrated high
EGFR GCN by FISH, and the frequency of both was
within the range of previous reports.16-18 KRAS mutation
status was not prognostic for survival, although patients
who had mutant KRAS had a nonsignificantly longer
median OS compared with patients who had wild-type
KRAS. Neither EGFR GCN nor KRAS mutation status
had statistically significant predictive value for a survival
benefit from TKI therapy. The small numbers of patients
who had wild-type KRAS make comparisons difficult with
data from randomized trials in colorectal carcinoma, in
which a benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies
was limited to KRAS wild-type tumors.10,11,21 Currently,
the molecular basis of this interaction is unknown.

mutations rarely have been reported18 apart from 1 study
that documented a high percentage of silent, somatic
mutations.22 Therefore, it is unlikely that the constitutively activating EGFR mutations play a prominent role in
pancreatic cancer.
Although the difference was nonsignificant, OS was
shorter for FISH-positive patients (high EGFR GCN)
compared with FISH-negative patients irrespective of the
treatment received. High EGFR GCN may be associated
with a worse outcome in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma who receive gemcitabine. However,
because patients with both high and low gene copy numbers may derive some benefit from erlotinib therapy (HR,
0.90 and 0.60, respectively), the results suggest the possibility that other molecules in the EGFR activation or signaling pathway may play a more critical ‘‘gatekeeper’’ role
in the biology of pancreatic cancer. In the PA.3 trial, the
development of significant rash (grade 2) predicted a
greater clinical benefit from erlotinib. In the current study,
we did not observe a correlation between KRAS mutation
status or EGFR GCN and rash. Recent data indicate a

correlation between the development of rash and the variability of pharmacokinetics.23
Among patients with advanced NSCLC who
received TKI therapy after failing on chemotherapy, those
with high EGFR GCN appeared to have a poorer prognosis if they did not receive the TKI, and a significant
improvement in survival was observed in those who did
receive the TKI.14,24 Subsequent studies on the role of
EGFR GCN as a predictive marker for EGFR TKI therapy have been less impressive, but those were trials that
included chemotherapy in the treatment. In the INTEREST trial, which compared the efficacy of gefitinib versus
docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC, EGFR FISH
results were not predictive of a greater advantage for gefitinib.15 In a retrospective analysis of tumor samples from
the phase 3 TRIBUTE study, which reported a lack of
benefit with the addition of erlotinib to carboplatin and
paclitaxel compared with chemotherapy alone, EGFR
FISH results were not predictive of an erlotinib benefit.25
The primary limitations of the current analysis were
the retrospective procurement of archival samples and the
low number of samples obtained. Furthermore, even
fewer samples were suitable for molecular analysis. Small
sample size and potential selection bias make drawing
firm conclusions difficult. Because this was an international trial, we were successful in obtaining tumor samples
from 181 of 569 patients (31.8%); however, KRAS mutation status and EGFR FISH results were available from
only 146 patients (25.7%), and only 86 patients (15.1%)
had both KRAS and EGFR results available. The success
rate of tissue procurement in this exploratory study was
not significantly different from the rate reported by other
large phase 3 trials in patients with advanced cancer,8,26,27
attesting to the challenges of tissue retrieval and the need
for standardized parameters for tissue collection for molecular studies. In pancreatic cancer, this problem is critical because of the accessibility of primary tumor and the
adequacy of core biopsies performed on metastatic sites.
The percentage of patients who underwent complete
resection was 2 or 3 times greater in the groups that had
known marker status compared with the groups that had
unknown marker status, reflecting the availability and adequacy of surgical resection samples for multiple molecular tests. In addition, patients with known marker status
had slightly but significantly higher performance status
than patients with unknown marker status. These differences potentially may have influenced the various prognostic and predictive results obtained for individual
markers.

Extensive biomarker evaluation in preclinical animal
models of pancreatic cancer may provide crucial information for guiding the next generation of clinical trials. Recent
studies in primary pancreatic xenografts that were treated
with erlotinib and the monoclonal antibody to EGFR,
cetuximab, used gene expression profiling to demonstrate
that the EGFR pathway was highly expressed in sensitive
tumors compared with resistant tumors. Further analysis
suggested that KRAS, phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic
subunit (PIK3CA), and EGFR amplification and mutation
status were not predictive of EGFR pathway activation.28
Finally, the classification of FISH-positive for EGFR
amplification as tumors with amplification or high polysomy
was extrapolated from studies in NSCLC. However, the
same classification may not accurately classify EGFR status
in pancreatic cancer.
In conclusion, molecular analyses indicate that
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have high
EGFR GCN may have shorter survival; however, the current results do not indicated that high EGFR GCN is predictive of a response to the EGFR TKI erlotinib. The role
of KRAS mutation as a predictor of resistance to EGFR
TKI therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer requires
more evaluation. The results of this analysis highlight the
importance of prospective and rigorous tissue collection in
all patients enrolled on randomized trials of pancreatic
cancer to better understand the effects of molecularly targeted agents.
