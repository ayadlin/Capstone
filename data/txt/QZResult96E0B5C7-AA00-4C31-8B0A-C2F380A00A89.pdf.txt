BACKGROUND: For this report, the authors estimated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and investigated
the toxicities of oxaliplatin combined with irinotecan in children with refractory solid tumors. METHODS:
Oxaliplatin was administered on Days 1 and 8 in combination with irinotecan on Days 1 through 5 and Days
8 through 12 of a 21-day cycle. An oral cephalosporin was administered daily to ameliorate irinotecan-associated diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies of oxaliplatin and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1
family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotyping were performed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled.
Dose-limiting diarrhea (n ¼ 3), serum lipase elevation (n ¼ 3), serum amylase elevation (n ¼ 2), colitis, abdominal pain, and headache (n ¼ 1 each) occurred at the first dose level (oxaliplatin at a dose of 60 mg/
m2; irinotecan at a dose of 20 mg/m2). Only 1 of 7 patients who received reduced doses of both agents
(40 mg/m2/dose oxaliplatin; 15 mg/m2/dose irinotecan) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT): diarrhea. When the oxaliplatin dose was re-escalated (60 mg/m2) with irinotecan at a dose of 15 mg/m2, 2 of 3
patients had a DLT (1 episode of diarrhea, 1 episode of hypokalemia). Myelosuppression was minimal. One
patient had a complete response, and another patient had stable disease for 6 cycles of therapy. The median oxaliplatin area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0!1) was 5.9 lg  hour/mL (range, 1.87.6 lg  hour/mL). The frequency of the 6/6, 6/7, and 7/7 UGT1A1 promoter genotypes was 5 of 10, 4 of 10,
and 1 of 10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The oxaliplatin MTD was 40 mg/m2 per dose on Days 1 and 8 in
combination with irinotecan 15 mg/m2 per dose on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12. There was some evidence of
antitumor activity; however, severe toxicity, both expected (diarrhea) and unexpected (elevation in pancreC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

On the basis of observations of additive or synergistic

antitumor activity in preclinical models,1-3 the combination of a platinating agent with a topoisomerase I poison
has been of interest in treating pediatric tumors.4-6 A limited number of responses to the combination of cisplatin6
or carboplatin5 plus topotecan have been observed in
children with rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, hepatoblastoma, and ependymoma. Unfortunately, myelotoxicity limited further development of these
platinum analogs in combination with topoisomerase
I inhibitors.
Oxaliplatin or trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane
(DACH) oxalatoplatinum, is a novel platinum agent more
potent than cisplatin in vitro7-11 that has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies against a spectrum of
tumors, including tumors that are cisplatin resistant.8-14
DNA adducts formed by oxaliplatin are bulkier and, thus,
more effectively inhibit DNA synthesis than those formed
by cisplatin and carboplatin.15,16 Cisplatin-resistant cell
lines may be sensitive to oxaliplatin because the loss of
mismatch repair contributes to cisplatin resistance, but not
oxaliplatin resistance, and replicative bypass of DNA
adducts contributes more significantly to cisplatin resistance than to oxaliplatin resistance.17
Irinotecan, a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I,
has antitumor activity in recurrent18-20 and newly diagnosed21 rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma,20,22,23 pediatric brain tumors,24,25 non-Hodgkin lymphoma,18 and
hepatoblastoma.22 In preclinical xenograft models of various childhood tumors, a protracted schedule of irinotecan
administration has been associated with better disease
responses.20,26,27 A variety of schedules has been used in
phase 1 studies of irinotecan in children. A protracted dosing schedule of intravenous irinotecan administered to
children with refractory solid tumors daily for 5 days of 2
consecutive weeks every 3 weeks ([every day  5]  2)
produced 1 of the better reported objective response
rates.20 The predominant reported toxicity associated
with this protracted schedule of irinotecan has been diarrhea with minimal dose-limiting myelosuppression.18,20
Irinotecan has been administered to children with rhabdomyosarcoma in several studies. At a dose of 20 mg/m2
daily administered ([every day  5]  2), 8 of 19 patients
(42%) with newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma had a
partial response,21 whereas 3 of 4 patients (75%) with
recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma demonstrated a complete
1766

or partial response.18 In contrast, in patients with recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma, only 4 of 35 patients (11%) had
an objective response to 600 mg/m2 per dose of irinotecan
administered every 3 weeks,19 and 1 of 18 patients (5.6%)
had an objective response to 50 mg/m2 daily for 5 days.28
These clinical results supported the preclinical studies
indicating that irinotecan may be more effective when
administered on a protracted schedule in childhood
malignancies.
The combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has
additive or synergistic effects in colon carcinoma cell lines
and xenografts.1,29 In adult colorectal carcinoma trials
that used dosing schedules from weekly to once every 2 to
3 weeks, the combination was tolerable and effective.30-34
Pharmacokinetic studies from 2 adult trials of the combination indicated that there were no significant alterations
in the pharmacokinetics of either drug.32,35 The major
toxicities included diarrhea, myelosuppression, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.
Herein, we report the results of a pediatric phase 1
trial of the combination of irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The
irinotecan schedule of ([every day  5]  2) was selected
because of its promising activity noted in preclinical and
early clinical trials. To maximize simultaneous drug exposure, thereby potentially increasing synergy, and because
weekly oxaliplatin was tolerable in pediatric patients,36
oxaliplatin was administered at the start of each week of
irinotecan. Because the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan
are well described in the pediatric population,20,23,28,37-41
and there is no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction when oxaliplatin is administered with irinotecan,32,33,42,43 only oxaliplatin pharmacokinetic studies
were obtained during this trial. Because the uridine
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1*28 (UGT1A1*28) genotype is associated with
increased irinotecan-associated toxicity in adults receiving
irinotecan every 3 weeks,44 UGT1A1 promoter genotyping was performed.

were eligible. Patients must have recovered from the acute
toxic effects of prior therapy with no evidence of active
graft versus host disease and could not have received 1)
myelosuppressive therapy within 3 weeks (nitrosourea
within 6 weeks); 2) hematopoietic growth factors or biologic (antineoplastic) agents within 1 week; 3) small-port
palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks; 4) total body,
craniospinal, whole spinal, whole lung/abdomen, or
>50% pelvic radiation within 6 months; 5) other substantial bone marrow radiation within 6 weeks; and 6)
stem cell transplantation within 3 months. No previous
oxaliplatin exposure was allowed. Organ function requirements included 1) bone marrow (peripheral absolute neutrophil count 1000/lL, platelet count 100,000/lL
[transfusion independent], and hemoglobin 8 g/dL); 1)
renal (normal serum creatinine for age or a glomerular
filtration rate 70 mL/minute/1.73 m2 and grade 1
serum electrolyte abnormalities [supplementation
allowed]); 3) liver (grade 1 hyperbilirubinemia, grade
2 hypoalbuminemia, and grade 2 elevation in alanine
transferase levels); 4) cardiac (no arrhythmia on electrocardiogram); and 5) pulmonary (no dyspnea at rest, no
exercise intolerance, no radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, and pulse oximetry >94% on room air if the
patient had a history of pulmonary abnormalities). Pregnant or breastfeeding patients were excluded. Patients of
reproductive age had to agree to use an effective contraceptive method. Patients who were receiving other investigational or anticancer agents or drugs that interact
with cytochrome P450, family 3 subfamily A (CYP3A)
(phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, barbiturates,
rifampicin, phenobarbital, azole antifungal agents, aprepitant, and St. John wort) were excluded. Patients who were
on corticosteroids had to receive a stable or decreasing
dose for 7 days before enrollment. Other exclusions
included 1) uncontrolled infection, 2) inability to comply
with protocol monitoring, 3) life-threatening allergy to
protocol-required agents, 4) grade >1 peripheral neuropathy, and 5) inability to tolerate enteral medications.
After the observation of dose-limiting elevations in serum
lipase and amylase in the first patient cohort, the study
was amended to exclude patients with grade >1 elevation
in serum amylase or lipase.
Informed consent was obtained from patients,
parents, or legal guardians, and assent as appropriate. The

protocol was approved by institutional review boards of
participating institutions.

Drug Administration and Study Design
Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ)
was supplied by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program
(National Cancer Institute [NCI], Bethesda, Md). The
drug was reconstituted in water with 5% dextrose and
infused intravenously over 2 hours after administering
an antiemetic. The infusion duration was increased to
6 hours in patients who experienced pharyngolaryngeal
dysesthesia.
Irinotecan (Camptosar; Pfizer, New York, NY) was
obtained from commercial suppliers, diluted in water
with 5% dextrose, and infused intravenously over 1 hour.
Oral cefixime (8 mg/kg daily; maximum dose. 400 mg) or
cefpodoxime (10 mg/kg daily; maximum dose, 400 mg
daily divided twice daily) was administered for 21 days
starting on Day 1 of each course to decrease irinotecanassociated diarrhea.45 Guidelines were provided for treating acute irinotecan-associated diarrhea with atropine and
for treating late diarrhea with loperamide.
The starting dose for oxaliplatin was 60 mg/m2 per
dose on Days 1 and 8 and, for irinotecan, the starting dose
was 20 mg/m2 per dose on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8
through 12 of a 21-day cycle with planned escalation of
oxaliplatin to 85 mg/m2 per dose. Because all patients in
the first cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT),
the next cohort received reduced doses of both irinotecan
(15 mg/m2 per dose) and oxaliplatin (40 mg/m2 per
dose). Then, oxaliplatin was escalated as described above
while the irinotecan dose remained 15 mg/m2. Irinotecan
was administered immediately after oxaliplatin on Days
1 and 8. Intrapatient dose escalation was not allowed.
Up to 17 courses of therapy were allowed in the absence
of disease progression if adequate organ function was
maintained.
At least 3 evaluable patients were treated at each
dose level. If 1 of 3 patients at a given level experienced a
DLT, then 3 more patients were accrued at that level. If
2 patients experienced DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded, and 3 more patients were
treated at the next lower dose level. The MTD was the
dose level at which 1 patient experienced a DLT with

spectrometry at ABC Laboratories (Columbia, Mo). The
lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng/mL; within-run and
between-run precision (CV%) was <10%.
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling with S-ADAPT,49 and data
were described by a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic
model with first-order elimination. The model parameters
that we estimated were the elimination rate constant (ke),
volume of distribution of the central compartment (V),
and intercompartmental rate constants (k12, k21). We
assumed that parameter distribution was log normal;
thus, intersubject (IIV) was modeled using an exponential
error model (Eq. 1):

Patient histories and physical examinations were obtained
before enrollment, weekly during Course 1 of therapy, and
before each subsequent course. Routine complete blood
counts, serum electrolytes, renal and liver function tests,
and pregnancy tests (if applicable) were obtained. Serum
amylase and lipase were monitored after the first cohort.
Adverse events were assessed using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version
3.0.46 Nonhematologic DLT was defined as any grade 3
or 4 nonhematologic toxicity attributable to the investigational drug, with the exclusion of 1) grade 3 nausea, vomiting, dehydration, or anorexia that required <7 days of
intravenous fluids, tube feedings, or total parenteral nutrition; 2) grade 3 liver enzyme elevation that returned to
baseline before the next course; 3) grade 3 fever or infection; 4) grade 3 electrolyte abnormality; 5) grade 3 diarrhea that persisted for <24 hours; and 6) grade 3 diarrhea
without protocol-defined supportive care (cefixime,
loperamide, and atropine). Grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity that persisted to Day 21 of Course 1 was defined as a
DLT. Hematologic DLT was defined as grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that lasted for >7 days or
myelosuppression that caused a delay >14 days between
treatment courses. Patients with bone marrow involvement by tumor were not evaluable for hematologic DLT.
Patients underwent disease-appropriate evaluations
within 2 weeks before study entry, after Course 1 of therapy, and every other course thereafter. If a patient had a
documented response, then studies were repeated after the
next consecutive course. Tumor response was assessed by
using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.47

in which Cpik and Ĉpik represent the kth actual and predicted PUF Pt concentrations, respectively, in individual
i. The error terms erel and eabs are components of the proportional (relative error) and additive error (absolute
error), respectively. We assumed that all error model parameters were distributed normally. Residual error components were obtained in terms of standard deviation.
The area under the concentration versus time curve
(AUC0!1) was calculated with the simulated concentrations obtained by the empirical Bayesian estimates parameters using ADAPT II.

Oxaliplatin Pharmacokinetic Studies

Pharmacogenetic Studies

In consenting patients, blood samples (5 mL) were collected before oxaliplatin infusion on Day 8 of Course 1
and then 3 hours, 4 hours, and 48 hours postinfusion. An
additional level was drawn before the next oxaliplatin
infusion on Day 1 of Course 2 (336 hours postinfusion). Samples were processed as described previously,48
and the plasma ultrafiltrate (PUF) platinum (Pt) concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass

In consenting patients, a 5-mL sample of whole blood
that was collected before drug administration was shipped
on ice to the reference laboratory at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital. Genomic DNA (10 ng) extracted
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was used to genotype the UGT1A1*28 promoter by polymerase chain
reaction amplification followed by fragment size analysis
as described previously.50

RESULTS

Toxicity

From April 2005 to February 2006, 14 patients were enrolled. One patient had grade 3 neutropenia before the
first dose of therapy and, thus, was ineligible. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of the 13 eligible patients
who received 27 courses of therapy (median, 2 courses;
range, 1-6 courses).

All 3 patients at the first dose level (60 mg/m2 per dose oxaliplatin, 20 mg/m2 per dose irinotecan) experienced similar
DLTs, and all required admission to the hospital during
the third week of Course 1 (Table 2). Two of the 3 patients
were admitted with grade 3 diarrhea and subsequently
developed elevated serum lipase levels, and 1 of those 2
patients had elevated an serum amylase level and also had
grade 2 abdominal pain. The third patient was admitted
with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and subsequent severe
diarrhea during the third week. Grade 3 colitis and abdominal pain along with elevation of serum amylase and lipase
developed during the fourth week of Course 1. Because of
the length and severity of these toxicities, all of these
patients were removed from protocol therapy after the first
course. None of them had a history of pancreatitis, diabetes
mellitus, or the use of concomitant medications that would
be associated with pancreatitis (such as corticosteroids or
asparaginase). Two of the 3 patients had received cefixime
as prescribed in the protocol. One patient missed >50%
of the prescribed doses because of nausea.
Because of severe toxicity and unexpected dose-limiting pancreatitis, the next cohort received reduced doses
of oxaliplatin (40 mg/m2 per dose) and irinotecan (15
mg/m2 per dose). No DLTs occurred in the initial 3patient cohort at this dose level. Re-escalation of the oxaliplatin dose to 60 mg/m2 with the reduced irinotecan dose
of 15 mg/m2 resulted in 2 of the 3 patients experiencing
DLT (diarrhea, hypokalemia). Therefore, the oxaliplatin
40 mg/m2-irinotecan 15 mg/m2 dose level was expanded
to 6 patients; 1 patient received an incorrect irinotecan
dose of 20 mg/m2 per dose and was replaced. One patient

and another patient had grade 3 diarrhea that was not considered dose-limiting because loperamide was not used; the
patient who received the incorrect irinotecan dose did not
experience DLT. Four of the 7 patients in this expanded

discontinued protocol therapy because of toxicity.
Therapy was discontinued secondary to toxicity in 6
of the 13 evaluable patients. Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize

Antitumor Activity
Five patients were removed from treatment before
response assessment. Another 4 patients were removed
for progressive disease after 1 to 3 courses. One patient
with recurrent metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma had who
received previous adjuvant treatment with irinotecan had
a complete response after 1 course that was sustained
through the fourth course (see Fig. 1). She voluntarily
withdrew at that point to pursue other therapy. Another
patient with refractory neuroblastoma had disease stabilization through 6 courses of therapy. Both of these patients
were treated at the MTD.

Pharmacokinetics
Seven patients consented to pharmacokinetic studies. PUF
Pt data were evaluable for pharmacokinetic modeling from
6 patients. Samples from 1 patient could not be used
because of preparation issues (ie, plasma not PUF). Population pharmacokinetics of PUF Pt were described by a 2compartment model (Fig. 2). Population pharmacokinetic
parameters (standard error) obtained were for ke 0.035 
0.002 hours, V 320.8  57.9 L/m2, k12 0.024  0.004
hours, and k21 0.0086  0.002 hours. Interindividual variabilities for PUF Pt ke and V were 11% and 42%, respectively. The proportional component of residual variability
was 17%, in accordance with the analytical assay error,
whereas the additive error was fixed considering the assay’s
quantitation limit. The median AUC calculated to the last
data point and the AUC0!1 were 5.8 lg  hour/mL (range,
1.6-7.5 lg  hour/mL) and 5.9 lg  hour/mL (range, 1.87.6 lg  hour/mL), respectively. The median terminal halflife was 142 hours (range, 132-166 hours).

genotypes were 5 of 10, 4 of 10, and 1 of 10, respectively.

on Days 1 and 8 with irinotecan at a dose of 15 mg/m2
per dose on Days 1 through 5 and Days 8 through 12.
The most common DLT was diarrhea. However, at
higher doses, the combination unexpectedly resulted
in significant elevations in serum amylase and lipase.
Myelosuppression was not significant, and no patient
experienced dose-limiting hematologic toxicity. Pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia was not common, but this was
expected given the low single dose of oxaliplatin that was
used. The peripheral neuropathy that was observed in
adults who received higher cumulative doses of oxaliplatin
was not observed in this trial; however, only 1 patient
received a significant cumulative dose of oxaliplatin
(480 mg/m2).
The combination of irinotecan (175-200 mg/m2
per dose) with oxaliplatin (85-130 mg/m2 per dose) every
3 weeks51,52 or of irinotecan (50 mg/m2 per dose) with
oxaliplatin (60 mg/m2 per dose) weekly33 has been tolerated well in adults. The novel schedule studied here in
children did not prove feasible. The basis for this
decreased tolerance is unclear, but a drug interaction
resulting in unexpectedly high irinotecan exposures
is unlikely to be the cause. The lack of pharmacokinetic interactions observed in previous studies in
adults,32,33,42,43 coupled with the differences in metabolism and elimination mechanism of oxaliplatin53 and irinotecan,54 does not support such a hypothesis, although
this was not studied directly in the current trial. The most
likely basis is a schedule-dependent pharmacodynamic
difference in drug tolerance of the combination on a protracted schedule.
The finding of clinically mild pancreatitis with
marked elevations in serum amylase and lipase was unexpected, because pancreatitis or elevations in serum lipase
or amylase have not been reported in published trials of
adults receiving the combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan either with42,43 or without32-34 fluorouracil/leucovorin. It is noteworthy that a study on the use of irinotecan
with carboplatin55 reported mild pancreatitis in 1 of 9
patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer. There also is a
report of pancreatitis in a patient with hepatic metastases
from colorectal carcinoma receiving oxaliplatin through
hepatic arterial infusion in combination with folinic acid
and 5-fluorouracil.56 However, it was unclear whether
that patient’s underlying disease contributed to the
pancreatitis. Thirty-eight cases of pancreatitis or elevated
1772

pancreatic enzymes have occurred in clinical trials during
Sanofi-Aventis’ postmarketing experience (unpublished
results). Most patients had alternative possible explanations for the pancreatitis, including concomitant medications or relevant medical history. Thus, it is unclear
whether the combination of oxaliplatin and irinotecan on
this schedule caused pancreatitis directly or whether elevated serum amylase and lipase were the result of severe
diarrhea, as described in patients with infectious
diarrhea.57
The pharmacokinetic limited sampling model used
for oxaliplatin pharmacokinetic studies consisted of only
4 plasma samples. Because data were sparse, we used a
nonlinear mixed-effects modeling analysis that uses the
Monte Carlo parametric expectation maximization algorithm as implemented in S-ADAPT. With this population approach, PUF Pt pharmacokinetics after a 2-hour
infusion of oxaliplatin was described adequately by a 2compartment model. Population estimates of PUF Pt
pharmacokinetic parameters are similar to those reported
in pediatric and adult patients.48,58 We observed that the
mean clearance was 11.2 L/hour/m2, which is within the
body surface area-normalized clearance ranges of 5.3 to
18.2 L/hour/m2 observed in adult patients.53,59
Current US Food and Drug Administration guidelines recommend that a patients’ UGT1A1 promoter genotype should be considered when prescribing irinotecan,
because adult patients with the 7/7 genotype have an
increased incidence of neutropenia after every-21-day
dosing of irinotecan.60 However, recent studies have
reported no correlation of toxicity with UGT1A1 genotype when irinotecan was administered on a low-dose,
protracted schedule in pediatric patients.50,61 We also did
not observe a relation between UGT1A1 genotype and
irinotecan-induced toxicity, but our patient numbers
were small.
One complete response to the oxaliplatin and irinotecan combination was observed in a patient with metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Even with a reduced
dose of irinotecan, the combination was effective, consistent with preclinical reports of synergy when these 2 agents
are combined.1,29 Despite signs of clinical activity, the
combination of oxaliplatin with irinotecan administered
on a protracted schedule was poorly tolerated. Even at the
MTD, 2 patients had grade 3 diarrhea, although 1 was
not considered dose-limiting because of noncompliance

data emerge that would support further clinical evaluation
of this combination.
