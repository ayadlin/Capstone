ABSTRACT
The underlying mechanisms for acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in about 30%-40% of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remain elusive. Recent studies have suggested that
activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and type 1 insulin-like growth
factor receptor (IGF1R) is associated with acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC.
Our study aims to further explore the mechanism of EMT and IGF1R in acquired EGFRTKIs resistance in NSCLC cell lines with mutant (PC-9) or wild-type EGFR (H460).
Compared to parental cells, EGFR-TKIs-resistant PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells displayed
an EMT phenotype and showed overexpression of IGF1R. SiIGF1R in PC-9/GR and
H460/ER cells reversed EMT-related morphologies and reversed their resistance to
EGFR-TKIs. Exogenous IGF-1 alone induced EMT in EGFR-TKIs-naïve PC-9 and H460
cells and increased their resistance against EGFR-TKIs. Inducing EMT by TGF-β1 in
PC-9 and H460 cells decreased their sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, whereas reversing EMT
by E-cadherin overexpression in PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells restored their sensitivity
to EGFR-TKIs. These data suggest that IGF1R plays an important role in acquired drug
resistance against EGFR-TKIs by inducing EMT. Targeting IGF1R and EMT may be a
potential therapeutic strategy for advanced NSCLC with acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance.

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system,
including IGF ligands, their receptors and binding proteins,
is important in promoting tumor development. Previous
studies showed that activation of IGF1R is involved in
EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC cell lines [9] and in lung
cancer patients [10]. IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors have
been reported to reverse the drug resistance of NSCLC to
EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo [7]. IGF1R activates the
downstream pathways of EGFR signaling, such as the
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
pathway and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway,
leading to secondary drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs [11–
13]. However, the exact mechanisms of IGF1R-induced
acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance remain to be elucidated.

INTRODUCTION
Acquired drug resistance has become a bottleneck
in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) using epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) [1–3]. Currently, the known
mechanisms underlying this acquired drug resistance
include T790M mutation [4, 5] and amplification of MET
genes [6]. These mechanisms account for about 60–70%
of acquired drug resistance. However, the underlying
mechanisms for approximately 30%-40% of cases are still
unclear. Recent studies show that the activation of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and type 1 insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is associated with acquired
drug resistance against EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC [7, 8].

Interestingly, IGF1R has been shown to play an
important role in EMT [7] and IGF1R activation can
induce EMT in breast epithelial cells [14] and prostate
cancer cells [15]. EMT is a biological process of losing
epithelial features and acquiring mesenchymal properties,
characterized by E-cadherin reduction and Vimentin
induction. It has been reported that a subgroup of NSCLC
with pronounced EMT was EGFR-TKIs resistant [3, 8, 16,
17], suggesting that EMT may render NSCLC insensitive
to EGFR inhibition. Furthermore, decreased expression
of E-cadherin [8, 16, 17] was associated with reduced
sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, and restoration of E-cadherin
expression improved cells’ sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs [18].
Consistently, clinical studies have suggested a prognostic
value of E-cadherin in NSCLC patients treated with EGFRTKIs [19–21].
Previously, we reported the association between
EMT, IGF1R expression and drug response in advanced
NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib [22]. NSCLC
patients with negative EMT or lower IGF1R expression
have a significantly higher objective response rate. Both,
IGF1R expression and EMT occurrence correlated with
the development of acquired drug resistance to EGFRTKIs in NSCLC patients. In the present study, we further
examined the relationship between EMT and IGF1R
expression with sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell
lines with wild-type or mutant EGFR. Furthermore, using
in vitro assays, we provided evidence that IGF1R induced
EGFR-TKIs resistance by inducing EMT and explored
the possible cellular mechanism. Our data highlight the
importance of EMT in IGF1R-induced resistance to
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC and implicate both EMT and
IGF1R as potential therapeutic targets for advanced
NSCLC.

of EGFR and the phosphorylation of EGFR (pEGFR)
showed no significant changes (Figure 1B).
To further evaluate whether activation of
the IGF1R pathway was the major mechanism
underlying acquired drug resistance, we targeted
silencing of IGF1R using siRNA technology in PC-9/
GR and H460/ER cells. The expression of IGF1R
in PC-9/GR-siIGF1R and H460/ER-siIGF1R cells
was downregulated, indicating that the interference
was successful, while the expression of EGFR and
pEGFR did not show significant changes (Figure
1C). PC-9/GR-siIGF1R and H460/ER-siIGF1R cells
had the same EGFR and KRAS gene state as their
parent cells (Supplementary Figure S4). Furthermore,
knockdown of IGFIR significantly decreased the IC50
of gefitinib and erlotinib in PC-9/GR and H460/ER
cells, respectively, suggesting that IGFIR may play an
important role in restoring their sensitivity to gefitinib
or erlotinib (Figure 1D).

EMT is involved in the acquirement of the
EGFR-TKIs-resistance phenotype
After the acquisition of drug resistance, PC-9/
GR and H460/ER cells showed EMT phenotypes, with
loose cell junctions and long, spindle-type morphology
(Figure 2A). Expression of the epithelial marker
E-cadherin decreased in PC-9/GR cells, and was
undetectable in H460 and H460/ER cells. In contrast,
the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, transcription factor
Snail and nuclear β-catenin all increased in PC-9/GR
and H460/ER cells, compared to their parental cells
(Figure 2B). Specifically, Vimentin expression gradually
increased in H460/ER cells in a time-dependent manner
upon erlotinib incubation (Figure 2C). Cell migration
and invasion abilities increased significantly in PC-9/
GR and H460/ER cells compared to their parental cells
as shown by scratch test and transwell experiment
(Figure 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G).
Treatment with TGF-β1 has also been shown in
many cancer cells to promote a shift from epithelial
to mesenchymal phenotype [25, 26]. To further
evaluate whether EMT constituted a major mechanism
underlying acquired drug resistance, parental PC-9
and H460 cells were treated with exogenous TGF-β1
(10 ng/mL) for 72 h. After TGF-β1 treatment,
both PC-9 and H460 cells acquired a spindle-like
morphology (Figure 3A) and expressed notably
reduced E-cadherin and increased Vimentin proteins
(Figure 3B). Interestingly, following TGF-β1-induced
transient EMT, the sensitivity of PC-9 and H460 to
EGFR-TKIs was dramatically reduced (Figure 3C),
which phenocopied the PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells,
respectively. These results indicated that transient
induction of mesenchymal-like phenotypes is sufficient
to induce resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cells.

RESULTS
IGF1R activation is involved in the acquirement
of the EGFR-TKIs-resistance phenotype
As expected, the resistant cells PC-9/GR and H460/
ER exhibited significantly decreased sensitivity to EGFRTKIs, compared to the parental PC-9 and H460 cells,
respectively (Figure 1A). The delE746-A750 deletion
mutation in exon 19 of EGFR was detected in PC-9 and
PC-9/GR cells by qPCR-HRM, but not in H460 or H460/
ER; however, the T790M mutation was not detected in any
of the cell lines. FISH analysis showed no amplification
of c-MET in PC-9/GR or H460/ER cells (Supplementary
Figure S2). No EGFR mutation in H460/ER cells was
found, and all cell lines harbored wild-type KRAS before
and after the induction of drug resistance (Supplementary
Figure S3). Additionally, the expression of IGF1R and
the phosphorylation of IGF1R (pIGF1R) increased
significantly in PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells after the
acquisition of drug resistance, while the expression

like morphology (Figure 4A). The expression of
E-cadherin in PC-9/GR-CDH1 and H460/ER-CDH1 cells
was significantly higher than that in the empty vector
controls, indicating that the lentiviral transfection of
E-cadherin was successful. Additionally, compared to the
empty vector control, the expression of Vimentin, Snail
and nuclear β-catenin decreased in PC-9/GR-CDH1 and
H460/ER-CDH1 cells (Figure 4B). Overexpression of
CDH1 correlated with a reduction of the nuclear β-catenin
in PC-9/GR and H460/ER by immunofluorescence
staining experiment (Supplementary Figure S6A). Most
importantly, the sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib
dramatically increased in E-cadherin-overexpressing
PC9/GR and H460/ER cells, respectively (Figure 4C),
suggesting that E-cadherin repressed EMT in NSCLC
cells, and subsequently enhanced the cytotoxic effect
of EGFR-TKIs. Finally, overexpression of E-cadherin
inhibited the motility and invasiveness of EGFR-TKIsresistant NSCLC cells shown by scratch test and transwell
assays (Figure 4D, 4E, 4F, 4G).

Figure S6B). Furthermore, activation of IGF1R by IGF-1
induced activation of pERK, but not of pAKT in PC9 and
H460 cells (Figure 6D and 6E). Finally, knockdown of
IGF1R dramatically attenuated the increase in total ERK
and pERK in PC-9/GR, and resulted in decreased pERK
in H460/ER (Figure 6D and 6E).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, both PC-9 cells, which harbor
the mutant EGFR, and H460 cells, with wild-type EGFR,
were used to establish EGFR-TKIs-resistant sublines
(PC-9/GR and H460/ER) by continuously culturing in
gefitinib or erlotinib, respectively. We did not detect the
classical T790M mutation or c-MET gene amplification
in either PC-9/GR or H460/ER cells. However,
expression of IGF1R and pIGF1R, but not that of EGFR,
were enhanced in these two resistant cell lines. These
results suggested that IGF1R has a major role in acquired
drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs, which is consistent with
previous studies. For example, Morgillo et al. [7] found
decreased EGFR and increased pIGF1R in erlotinibresistant H460 cells. They also found that the combined
treatment of an IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor with
erlotinib inhibits cell proliferation significantly. VazquezMartin et al. [27] and Cortot et al. [28] also suggested a
role of IGF1R in acquired drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs
in PC-9 cells.
To further evaluate the role of IGF1R in acquired
EGFR-TKIs resistance, we knocked down IGF1R by
siRNA in PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells and found that
both cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib.
Furthermore, our data showed that exogenous IGF-1
application in EGFR-TKIs-naïve PC-9 and H460 cells
triggered IGF1R activation, and increased cells’ resistance
to EGFR-TKIs. Guix et al. [29] also discovered that IGF1 activated IGF1R in lung cancer cells, and showed that
only cells, which depended on IGF1R and its downstream
signaling pathways to promote cell growth, acquired the
resistance ability against geftinib. Taken together, our
results provided direct evidence that activation of IGF1R
is one of the mechanisms underlying acquired drug
resistance to EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer cells.
There are still few studies addressing the mechanism
of IGF1R activation in EGFR-TKIs resistance in lung
cancer cells. One possible mechanism is that after EGFR
pathway is inhibited, IGF1R pathway is activated to
promote cell survival and proliferation [7]. Morgillo et al.
[7] found that erlotinib treatment of H460 cells increase
the levels of EGFR/IGFIR heterodimer on cell membrane,
subsequently activate IGFIR and its downstream signaling
mediators. Data in the present study, which were consistent
with Peled et al’s [9] report, showed that exogenous IGF-1
alone does not promote lung cancer cell proliferation, but
instead increases cell survival against erlotinib. Further
study is needed in this regard.

Exogenous IGF-1 induced EMT in EGFR-TKIsnaïve NSCLC cells and increased their resistance
to EGFR-TKIs
To test whether IGF1R overexpression alone can
trigger EMT and EGFR-TKIs resistance, exogenous IGF1 was applied to EGFR-TKIs-naïve PC-9 and H460 cells.
Twenty-four hours after IGF-1 induction, both IGF1R and
pIGF1R were induced, and no significant change of EGFR
was observed (Figure 5A). The IGF-1 induced cells also
acquired a mesenchymal phenotype and a spindle-like
morphology (Figure 5B). EMT occurrence was further
confirmed by decreased expression of E-cadherin, and
increased expression of Vimentin, nuclear β-catenin and
Snail (Figure 5A). In addition, β-catenin was shown to
translocate from cell membrane into the nuclear after IGF1 induction by Immunofluorescence experiment (Figure
5C). IGF-1 alone does not promote lung cancer cell
proliferation (data not shown), however IGF-1 induced
PC-9 and H460 cells showed decreased sensitivity to
EGFR-TKIs compared to parental cells (Figure 5D). These
results indicated that activation of IGF1R is associated
with EMT process.

IGF1R induced EMT of NSCLC cells by
enhancing ERK/MAPK signaling
To clarify the association among IGF1R activation,
EMT, and resistance to EGFR-TKIs, we explored whether
the induction of EMT might proceed through the activation
of IGF1R to promote resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC
cells. Knockdown of IGF1R by siRNA repressed the EMTrelated morphological features (Figure 6A and 6B). We
also demonstrated that knockdown of IGF1R attenuated
the decrease of E-cadherin expression and the increase
of Vimentin, Snail and nuclear β-catenin expression in

It is well established that EMT is involved in
acquired drug resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cells
carrying wild-type EGFR, for instance, in A549 [8, 30]
and in H1229 cells [30]. However, there is still paucity
of evidence to support a role of EMT in acquired drug
resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cells with EGFR
mutations. By downregulating N-cadherin expression
via siRNA, Zhang et al. [31] found that the loss of EMT
can reduce the proliferation and invasion of erlotinibresistant H1650ER cells harboring a mutation in exon 19
of the EGFR gene. Vazquez-Martin et al. [27] showed
that EMT also occurred after PC-9 cells acquired drug
resistance to erlotinib. To obtain direct evidence for the

role of EMT in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, we
firstly induced EMT with TGF-β1 and then evaluated
cells’ sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs before and after EMT in
PC-9 and H460 cells, which are sensitive to EGFR-TKIs
at baseline. We observed a mesenchymal phenotype and
decreased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs after EMT induction.
We then reversed EMT of PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells
by overexpressing E-cadherin and studied their sensitivity
to EGFR-TKIs. Reversal of EMT-related morphological
and transcriptional features by E-cadherin overexpression
in PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells was sufficient to recover
cells’ sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. These data
suggested that EMT, independent of EGFR mutation and

MET amplification, is a novel mechanism of EGFR-TKIsresistance.
Previous studies have shown that IGF-1/IGF1R
activation can promote EMT in prostate cancer cells [15]
and human mammary epithelial cells [32]. Nurwidya et
al. [33] found that inhibition of IGF1R reversed hypoxiainduced EMT. We further investigated whether one of
the underlying mechanisms of IGF1R on acquired drug
resistance is through EMT. We found that along with IGF1R
upregulation, both PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells acquired
EMT phenotype. Exogenous IGF-1 administration in EGFRTKIs-naïve PC-9 and H460 cells also triggered IGF1R
activation, and subsequently EMT. Furthermore, we showed
that siIGF1R in PC-9/GR and H460/ER cells reversed EMTrelated morphological and transcriptional features, restored
cells’ sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib. These data suggest
IGF1R plays an important role in acquired drug resistance
against EGFR-TKIs by inducing EMT.
The mechanism of IGF1R-induced EMT remained
unclear in current literatures. Loss of E-cadherin is a critical
step in EMT and corresponds with the morphological and
cellular alterations [34, 35]. Factors that inhibit E-cadherin
expression, such as nuclear transcription factor Snail, ZEB,
Slug etc [36] are involved in EMT process. Internalization of
the protein complex leads to the degradation of E-cadherin and
the relocalization of β-catenin into the nucleus also contributes
to this process [37–39]. Data of the present study showed that
the expression of Snail was significantly increased after cells
acquired drug resistance, and was significantly decreased
when IGF1R was silenced, indicating that Snail may be the
major transcription factors involved in EMT. Our results
also showed that β-catenin relocated from cell membrane
into nucleus after IGF-1 induction in NSCLS cells, whereas
β-catenin decreased when IGF1R was silenced. Graham et al.
[15] showed that IGF-1 up-regulates ZEB1 expression through
the ERK/MAPK pathway in prostate cancer cells. We herein
showed that activation of IGF1R by IGF-1 induced activation
of the pERK, but not of pAKT in both PC-9 and H460 cells,
whereas pERK decreased dramatically when IGF1R was
silenced. Our results indicated that IGF1R may induce EMT in
NSCLC cells by upregulating the expression of Snail through
activating ERK/AKT pathway, and promoting β-catenin
translocation away from cytoplasmic membrane into the
nucleus, which directly, repress the expression of E-cadherin.
Taken together, our findings highlight the importance
of EMT in IGF1R-induced resistance to EGFR-TKIs
in NSCLC. Interference of EMT or IGF1R might be a
promising therapeutic strategy for advanced NSCLC.

Both of the lung cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37°C incubator
under 5% CO2. Drug resistant PC-9 and H460 cells was
obtained by continuous culturing the cells in gefitinib (2.5
μmol/L) or erlotinib (10 μmol/L), each for six months. The
resistant PC-9 and H460 cells were designated as PC-9/
GR and H460/ER cells, accordingly.

DNA extraction and detection of EGFR gene
mutations
Lung cancer cells in the logarithmic growth
phase were trypsinized and collected. DNA extraction
was performed using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Germany), according to the instruction manual. The
integrity of the isolated DNA was assessed by 1.2%
agarose gel electrophoresis. EGFR mutations were
detected using quantitative PCR-high-resolution melting
(qPCR-HRM) curve analysis technology [23].

C-Met Fluorescence in situ hybridization
MET fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was
performed on unstained formalin-fixed lung cancer cell
suspension, using a MET/CEP7 probe cocktail (Kreatech
Diagnostics, Amsterdam, Netherlands) according to
manufacturer’s instructions [24]. A MET/CEP ratio was
established on the basis of a count of at least 200 cells.
Specifically, two independent observers scored at least
100 non-overlapping interphase nuclei to determine the
number of MET gene-specific (red) and CEP7-specific
(green) signals. Samples with a ratio of MET/CEP7
greater than 2 were considered to have MET amplification
(low amplification < 2, high amplification ≥ 2).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were
inoculated into 96-well culture plates at 1,500 cells
per well. After adherent growth was observed, 100 μL
of culture medium (0.5% FBS) containing different
concentrations of gefitinib and erlotinib were added to the
cells. After 72 h incubation, 20 μL of MTT (5g/L) were
added to each well, and incubated for an additional 4 h.
The supernatant was then discarded, and 150 μL of DMSO
were added. The plates were then agitated for 10 min and
the absorbance value (D) were measured at 492 nm with a
microplate reader. Cell survival rates after drug treatment
and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) were
calculated. Each treatment included six replicates, and
three independent experiments were performed.

An integrated optical density analysis was performed
using Quantity One imaging analysis software.

and non-invasive cells remaining in the top chamber were
wiped using a cotton swab, followed by crystal violet
staining. The cells were placed under an Olympus inverted
fluorescence microscope (200 ×) and photographed. Three
fields were chosen for counting, and the values were
averaged.

SiIGF1R
According to the sequence information of IGF1R
gene (GenBank No., NM-000875), three shRNA was
designed using the RNAi design software provided
by Ambion. The most efficient interference target
sequence “CGA AGA TTT CAC AGT CAA A” was
chosen (Supplementary Figure S1). Both strands of the
interference sequences were synthesized by Shanghai
Genechem. DNA oligo: IGF1-siRNA-a: 5'-CCG GGC
CGA AGA TTT CAC AGT CAA ACT CGA GTT TGA
CTG TGA AAT CTT CGG CTT TTT G-3' and IGF1siRNA-b: 5'-AAT TCA AAA AGC CGA AGA TTT
CAC AGT CAA ACT CGA GTT TGA CTG TGA AAT
CTT CGG C-3'. Through BLAST homology analysis,
no homology with any other genes was found for the
selected sequences. In addition, a nonsense sequence
was synthesized as the negative control sequence.
Plasmid DNA with the siRNA and control sequence
were purified and used for lentiviral packaging and
titer determination. Then, 293T cells in the logarithmic
phase were co-transfected with the recombinant pGCLV plasmid, pHelper 1.0 plasmid, and pHelper 2.0
plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 8
h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with
complete culture medium. Following culture for another
48 h, the supernatant with enriched lentiviral particles was
collected. The supernatant was concentrated to obtain a
high-titer lentiviral concentrate. PC-9/GR and H460/ER
cells in the logarithmic phase were trypsinized to obtain
cell suspension and were inoculated into 6-well plates.
When cell confluence reached approximately 30%, an
appropriate amount of virus was added at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 100. Puromycin (5 μg/mL) was
added 48 h later. The cells were photographed under a
fluorescence microscope to observe the infection rate
72 hours later. A negative control group transfected with
lentivirus expressing the empty IGF1R vector (siControl)
and a gene silencing group transfected with effective
lentivirus expressing IGF1R (siIGF1R) were included in
the experiment.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated into 12-well plates at 2.0 × 104
cells per well. After 48 h, the cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing with PBS
for 3 times, the cells were blocked in blocking solution
(3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100) at room temperature for
60 min. The cells were subsequently incubated with the
primary antibodies (rabbit anti-E-cadherin at 1:50; rabbit
anti-β-catenin at 1:50; CST) at 4°C overnight. The primary
antibodies were then removed, and secondary antibody
was added (Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:500;
Life Technologies), and incubated for 1 h. Finally, the
nuclei were stained with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Sigma), and
the fixed cells were observed and photographed using
an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope
(Olympus Optical).

Scratch test and invasion assay
For Scratch test, cells from each group were
inoculated into 6-well plates at 5.0 × 104 cells per well.
When cell confluence reached 90%, the cells were starved
overnight in serum-free medium. Three parallel lines were
scratched on the bottom of the culture plate using a sterile
20 μL micropipette tip. The cells were washed twice using
serum-free medium and cultured for another 48 h. The
changes in cell motility were observed and photographed
under an Olympus inverted fluorescence phase-contrast
microscope (40 ×). Three independent experiments were
performed.
Cell invasion was determined using Boyden
Chamber assay. The top transwell chamber was inoculated
with 5 × 105 cells in 200 μL of serum-free culture medium.
The bottom chamber was filled with 500 μL of RPMI
culture medium containing 10% FBS. After the cells were
cultured at 37°C for 24 h, the top chamber was removed,

Stable LV-CDH1 (E-cadherin) gene
overexpression
The CDH1(5386–1)-P1 and CDH1(5386–1)-P2
primers, containing exchange pairing bases, enzymatic
cutting sites, and a partial 5′-terminal target gene sequence,
were designed, synthesized, and then used to amplify
the target gene. The sequences of the primers were as

CGC AG and CDH1(5386–1)-P2: TCA CCA TGG TGG
CGA CCG GGT CGT CCT CGC CGC CTC CGT ACA.
The amplification products were digested with enzymes
and ligated into the lentiviral expression vector GV218.
Following transformation, positive clones were picked, and
plasmids were extracted after the CDH1 (5386–1) sequence
was confirmed via sequencing. GV218-CDH1 (5386–1)
and the empty control GV218 plasmid were obtained and
transfected into 293T cells. The cells were then cultured in
Opti-MEM culture medium containing 1% FBS for 48–72
h. H460/ER and PC-9/GR cells were infected at an MOI
of 100. Lentivirus production and cell infection procedures
were the same as described above. Cells with more than 80%
fluorescence rate were used for subsequent experiments. A
negative control transfected with an empty vector lentivirus
(Control) and an overexpression control transfected with
effective lentivirus expressing CDH1 (CDH1) were included
in the experiment.
