Abstract
Tumor chemoresistance is associated with high aerobic glycolysis rates and
reduced oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon called “Warburg effect” whose
reversal could impair the ability of a wide range of cancer cells to survive in the
presence or absence of chemotherapy. In previous studies, Short-term-starvation
(STS) was shown to protect normal cells and organs but to sensitize different cancer
cell types to chemotherapy but the mechanisms responsible for these effects are
poorly understood. We tested the cytotoxicity of Oxaliplatin (OXP) combined with a
48hour STS on the progression of CT26 colorectal tumors. STS potentiated the effects
of OXP on the suppression of colon carcinoma growth and glucose uptake in both
in vitro and in vivo models. In CT26 cells, STS down-regulated aerobic glycolysis,
and glutaminolysis, while increasing oxidative phosphorylation. The STS-dependent
increase in both Complex I and Complex II-dependent O2 consumption was associated
with increased oxidative stress and reduced ATP synthesis. Chemotherapy caused
additional toxicity, which was associated with increased succinate/Complex IIdependent O2 consumption, elevated oxidative stress and apoptosis .
These findings indicate that the glucose and amino acid deficiency conditions
imposed by STS promote an anti-Warburg effect characterized by increased oxygen
consumption but failure to generate ATP, resulting in oxidative damage and apoptosis.

Introduction

Results

Tumor cells are characterized by high glucose
uptake and lactate production regardless of oxygen
concentration, a phenomenon known as the “Warburg
effect” [1]. The metabolic shift toward the Warburg
effect confers bioenergetic and biosynthetic advantages
to proliferating cells by increasing non-oxidative ATP
production and generating metabolic intermediates
from glucose important for cell growth [2]. Glutamine
represents an additional metabolite catabolized by
tumor cells and utilized for biosynthetic processes
[3]. Aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis contribute
to the chemoresistance of cancer cells [4] through :i)
increased lactate production and export, ii) elevated
NADPH limiting DNA oxidant drug effectiveness, and
iii) decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
rate leading to reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)mediated DNA damage [5-8]. Therefore, strategies
inhibiting glycolysis and glutaminolysis and promoting
OXPHOS in order to delay tumor growth and overcome
drug resistance are being investigated [9-11]. The return
of cancer cells to the normal respiratory mode maintained
by normal cells could also promote cancer cell death if
the respiration was accompanied by electron leakage and
superoxide generation [12, 13], leading to cellular damage
and apoptosis [14, 15].
In mice, three day cycles of water only fasting
(Short-Term-Starvation, STS) cause a generalized glucose
and amino acid reduction/deficiency, which protects
normal but not tumor cells against chemotherapy-mediated
cytotoxicity [16], and induces potent chemosensitizing
effects in many tumors [17, 18].
Preliminary clinical data indicates that in cancer
patients fasting is not associated with major side effects
and may reduce several of the side effects associated
to chemotherapy [19] including a decreased toxicity to
lymphocytes [20]. These pre-clinical and preliminary
clinical results served as the foundation for randomized
trials to test the safety and efficacy of fasting cycles on
the effect of chemotherapy on both normal and cancer
cells (NCT01304251, NCT01175837, NCT00936364,
NCT01175837).
However, the molecular mechanisms responsible
for the chemosensitizing effects of fasting on cancer cells
remain poorly understood [17, 21].
Here, using both in vitro and in vivo colon carcinoma
models, we show that STS exerts an anti-Warburg effect
driving tumor cells from a glycolytic mode into an
uncoupled OXPHOS which promotes increased ROS
generation and apoptosis. These effects are enhanced by
chemotherapy treatment.

Effects of fasting cycles and chemotherapy on
colon carcinoma growth and glucose consumption
in vivo
We investigated the effect of STS +/- chemotherapy
on glucose metabolism in CT26 colon carcinoma cells in
mice by micro-PET analyses. As previously described [16,
17], 48-hour of STS induced a significant body weight
loss and serum glucose reduction. Analysis of tracer
uptake by the tumor showed a differential response to the
treatments (Figure 1A-C). After the first cycle, STS was
as effective as oxaliplatin (OXP) in reducing the average
tumor glucose consumption (Figure 1C). However, the
lowest values were achieved by STS+OXP (Figure 1A-C).
Monitoring of tumor progression during multiple cycles
revealed that average tumor metabolism was inhibited
similarly by the first and second STS treatments (Figure
1C). Chemotherapy induced only a transient reduction
of the lesion metabolic rate after its first application.
By contrast, average glucose consumption remained
significantly lower in STS+OXP-treated mice (Figure 1C).
The metabolic response to treatment was paralleled
by an evident effect of STS on cancer growth, mostly
during the fasting and not the post-fasting period (Figure
1D). The transient effect of STS on tumor growth was
repeatable. OXP instead showed a deceleration in cancer
growth which was enhanced by STS (STS+OXP) (Figure
1D). The additive effect of STS+OXP was also evident
when total cancer glucose consumption rate was measured
(tumor glucose metabolism/gr/min x total tumor volume).
After both cycles, this glucose consumption rate was much
lower in either STS- or OXP-treated mice but was lowest
in STS+OXP-treated mice compared to that in untreated
mice (STS+OXP vs STS 1° cycle P=0.05; STS+OXP vs
OXP 1° cycle P=0.03; STS+OXP vs OXP 2° cycle P=0.01)
(Figure 1E). In summary, these results indicate that STS
enhances the toxicity of chemotherapy to colon cancer
cells, resulting in decreased glucose consumption rates.

In vitro effects of STS and chemotherapy on
viability and metabolism of colon carcinoma cells
We investigated the in vitro effects of STS on a
panel of colon carcinoma cell lines grown under normal
or conditions mimicking starvation [17] for 48 hours.
One day after STS, the cells were treated with OXP. STS
and OXP showed additive cytotoxic effects in all the cell
lines tested (Figure 2A). FDG uptake paralleled viability
response since it was reduced by a similar degree by each
single stressor, although the greatest impairment occurred
in response to STS+OXP (Figure 2B). These results
confirm the in vivo results and support the use of the in

Dehydrogenase (LDH) expression and enzymatic activity.
STS and in particular STS+OXP down-regulated the
expression of PI3K/p110 (STS vs CTR: 81%; STS+OXP
vs CTR: 48%), phospho-PDK1 (STS vs CTR: 57%;
STS+OXP vs CTR: 84%) and phospho-AKT (STS vs
CTR: 75%; STS+OXP vs CTR: 58%) and up-regulated
PTEN expression (STS vs CTR: 122%; STS+OXP vs
CTR: 121%) (Figure 3A). Notably, the latter effects
matched well the effects of the treatments on CT26
proliferation (Supplementary Figure 1).
The effects of STS on proteins involved in glucose
transport and metabolism was even more evident:
STS induced a profound reduction in GLUT1 (STS vs
CTR: 15%),GLUT2 (STS vs CTR: 40%), HKII (STS
vs CTR: 74%; STS+OXP vs CTR: 48%), PFK1 (STS
vs CTR: 74%; STS+OXP vs CTR: 48%), PK (STS
vsCTR:64%;STS+OXP vs CTR: 66% ) protein expression,

STS and chemotherapy differentially regulate
proliferation and metabolic enzymes in colon
carcinoma cells
Because CT26 cells displayed the greatest
sensitivity to STS in terms of viability and metabolic
response (Figure 2A-B), we selected these cells to measure
key mediators of proliferation and glucose metabolism in
the PI3K-AKT pathway (PI3K, Phosphatase and Tensin
Homolog (PTEN), 3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Kinase
1 (PDK1) and AKT). The effect of STS on metabolism
was also evaluated by measuring GLUT1 and GLUT2
(both involved in glucose uptake) and the glycolytic
enzyme HKII, PFK, Pyruvate Kinase (PK), and Lactate

inoculum, the mice were either fasted or maintained on the ad lib standard diet for 48 hours and treated with Oxaliplatin (OXP) (10 mg/Kg).
After 1 week, the treatment was repeated. All mice were imaged after the first and the second cycle of therapy by a dedicated micro-PET

Expression of glycolytic and glutaminolytic
enzymes in response to STS and chemotherapy

particularly in combination with chemotherapy (Figure
3A).
HK II catalytic function was reduced by all
treatments (Figure 3B) but its intracellular localization
was also affected. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a
re-localization of HK II from the mitochondrial membrane
into the cytosol, particularly after STS+OXP treatment
(Figure 3C). Glucose metabolism impairment was further
aggravated by the concomitant reduction of PFK (Figure
3D), PK (Figure 3E) and LDH (Figure 3F) activity caused
by all treatments. STS-associated impairment of enzymes
involved in glucose metabolism was confirmed by the
analysis of extracellular lactate concentration, which was
markedly reduced by STS alone or in combination with
OXP (Figure 3G).
The STS-mediated reduction of glucose catabolism
and expression of transport enzymes is consistent with the
reduced levels of glucose caused by STS but also with
the possibility that STS conditions promote a Warburg
reversing effect .

The transcriptome and proteome of STS- and OXPtreated CT26 cells were analyzed by oligonucleotide
microarrays and Label Free Quantitation (LFQ) on High
Resolution/Mass Accuracy Liquid Chromatography
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HR/MA LC MS/MS),
respectively. Figure 3H shows a heat map of proteins
involved in glycolysis and glutaminolysis. The downregulation of glycolytic enzymes was observed in STStreated CT26 cells (Figure 3H), with or without OXP
treatment. This down-regulation is most likely due to
an effect of STS at the transcriptional level since the
expression profiles of STS-treated cells show a clear
down-regulation of the genes encoding these enzymes
(Figure 3I). At the gene expression level, OXP-treated
cells also show reduced expression of glycolysis genes
but this effect is more evident in STS+OXP-treated cells
(Figure 3I). STS also reduced both glutaminase (Gls)

mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, the expression of
the glutamine transporter Slc1a5 was reduced only at the
protein level (Figure 3H-I). The combination of STS+OXP
reduced protein and mRNA levels of both glutaminase and
the Slc5a1 (Figure 3H-I). These results confirm that the
reduced glucose levels in combination with other changes
imposed by STS, have a major effect in down-regulating
glycolytic genes and proteins.

B). Clear changes were instead observed when measuring
enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes, oxygen
consumption and ATP: STS up-regulated Complex I and
IV (Figure 4A and C) without affecting Complex II activity
(Figure 4B). Consistent with this effect, a significant
increase in O2consumption rate (OCR), indicative of an
increased oxidative metabolism, was observed (Figure
4D and E). This corresponded to a significant reduction
of ATP synthesis (Figure 4F and G). Accordingly, the
ATP/AMP ratio, a good indicator of cellular energy
charge, was dramatically reduced by the two STS settings
(Supplementary Figure 2C).
In order to confirm the stimulatory effect of STS
on Complex I-activity, we pre-incubated CT26 cells
with Rotenone, a Complex I inhibitor. In the presence
of Rotenone, none of the treatments caused a significant
OCR increase (Figure 4H) or ATP synthesis reduction
(Figure 4I).

Increased activity of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain with a decreased ATP production suggests a possible
increase in superoxide generation caused by electron
leakage, possibly at complex I and III [22]. Indeed, STS
and OXP markedly increased ROS generation in CT26
cells and STS+OXP further exacerbated ROS production
(Figure 5A). These profound metabolic alterations,
characterized by reduced ATP biosynthesis and increased
ROS production, are likely responsible for the additive
effect of STS+OXP in triggering apoptosis in CT26 cells
(Figure 5B-C).
This response was confirmed by proteomic analyses
(Figure 5D) documenting an apoptotic signature obtained
by hierarchical clustering of a 110 apoptotic proteins
(GO:0006915) [23]. STS, OXP and especially STS+OXP

induced the expression of many pro-apoptotic proteins
(Figure 5D). In summary, these results strongly support
the effect of STS on reducing glycolysis and lactate
production and increasing respiration at Complexes I-IV
resulting in superoxide production/oxidative stress but in
reduced ATP generation.

Discussion
Our results indicate that STS, defined as a water only
diet lasting 2 days in mice or severe serum plus glucose
restriction in vitro, causes a profound metabolic shift and
promotes an anti-Warburg effect in colon cancer cells.
We show that STS in vitro down-regulates glycolysis and
glutaminolysis and increases OXPHOS and OCR, reduces

ATP synthesis and increased ROS production. This latter
effect is presumably associated with the induction of
apoptosis.Chemotherapy increased this toxicity further
by inducing both Complex I and Complex II-dependent
respiration, leading to elevated toxic oxygen species
generation but reduced ATP generation and death.
Cancer cells alter their metabolism in order to
satisfy their bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements,
generating a peculiar metabolic pattern characterized by
high aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and glutamine
metabolism [1]. Aerobic glycolysis produces higher ATP
and NADH levels [24, 25] which may contribute to
chemoresistance through increased drug efflux from the
cell, enhanced DNA repair, dysregulation of growth factor
signaling and high expression of survival pathways or antiapoptotic genes [26]. For these reasons, the combination
of chemotherapy and agents able to affect the ability of
cancer cells to adopt alternate metabolic strategies and
survive represents a promising strategy to overcome drug

resistance and improve chemotherapeutic index [27].
Therapies targeting cancer metabolism such as calorie
restriction and ketogenic diet [28,29] can modify the
metabolic state of the whole organism but also that of the
tumor cells. Part of the effects of STS could be achieved
by agents that target metabolic enzymes including glucose
transporters, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate
dehydrogenase, lactate transporter, and glutaminase [4].
However, STS provides two advantages: 1) in both mice
and humans it causes virtually no severe side effects since
it differentially affects normal and cancer cells, 2) it alters
the function of hundreds of proteins and enzymes thus
increasing the chance of affecting a pathway required for
tumor cell survival, particularly under the already hostile
environment generated by chemotherapy.
Multiple cycles of STS have been shown to protect
normal cells against chemotoxicity and to increase the
effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs against the
survival and progression of various tumor types [16,

Figure 6: A Model of Short term starvation effects on the metabolism of the tumor cell. Starvation in terms of reduced

availability of glucose and aminoacids in the extracellular space determines a reduced expression of the glucose transporters Glut1 and
Glut2 and leads to a general reduction in the glycolytic rate through the down-regulation of gene and protein expression as well as activity
of almost all enzymes of the glycolytic chain. As a consequence, the production and secretion of lactate is reduced, with potential effects
on the tumor microenvironment. This anti-Warburg effect is also accompanied by increased activities of complexes I, III and IV of the
respiratory chain. However, uncoupling of respiration leads to the production of increased amounts of free oxygen radicals that determine
an enhanced oxidative damage to the nuclear DNA. This latter event is responsible for the induction of apoptotic cell death. Uncoupling
also causes a reduced activity of complex V of the respiratory chain resulting in ATP deficiency which makes tumor cell more vulnerable
to the chemotherapeutic insult.

of STS on glycolysis and lactate production alone,
could cause a major effect on cancer progression, even
independently of its effects on mitochondria.
The inhibition of glucose utilization is accompanied
by a down-regulatory effect of STS on the glutamine
transporters Slc1a5 and glutaminase, which catalyze
glutamine catabolism and provide cancer cells with biosynthetic precursors for aminoacids and DNA synthesis
[45-47].
As a metabolic counterpart of glycolysis inhibition,
STS induces ROS levels and apoptosis, probably as the
result of a futile enhancement of mitochondrial complex
activity uncoupled from ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial
OXPHOS is a major cellular source of ROS, mainly
through the activity of complex I and III. The most likely
explanation for the increase in Complex I and IV activities,
accompanied by increased OCR but reduced ATP
generation and elevated ROS production after STS, OXP
or their combination is that the cancer cells are not able to
synthesize ATP at the rate dictated by oxygen consumption
therefore increasing the electron leakage at Complexes I
and III to form superoxide [1, 13, 22] (Figure 6). Higher
superoxide and lower ATP could then promote cell death in
part through ROS-induced apoptosis [12, 48, 49]. On the
other hand, OXP, as a chemotherapeutic agent, provokes
DNA damage-dependent apoptosis. Hence, the apoptotic
activities induced by STS and chemotherapy complement
each other. In conclusion, the present study indicates
that the combination of STS cycles and chemotherapy
causes a major enhancement of chemotherapeutic index,
in part by promoting an anti-Warburg effect characterized
by reduced glycolysis, reduced lactate generation, and
increased oxidative phosphorylation with lower ATP
synthesis but higher ROS generation and apoptosis.

30]. However, whether STS sensitizes tumor cells to
chemotherapy by affecting their metabolism is presently
unknown. In agreement with previous reports [17, 18, 21],
our present results demonstrate that STS, especially in
combination with chemotherapy, delays the in vivo and in
vitro growth of colon carcinoma cells. We show that STS
significantly reduces cancer glucose consumption leading
to a transient arrest in cancer progression followed by a
rebound phase after re-feeding. By contrast, STS+OXP
causes a more severe metabolic impairment and a longlasting decrease in cancer growth. Both observations
confirm the relationship between glucose consumption and
proliferation rate in cancer.
The profound metabolic alterations observed
in tumor cells are often related to induction of PI3KAKT signaling, which plays a pivotal role in glucose
metabolism and cancer growth control [1]. Phosphorylated
AKT has been shown to: i) up-regulate the expression of
glucose transporters , ii) enhance glucose capture by HK
and iii) to stimulate PFK [2]. Our study indicates that STS
down-regulates PI3K, AKT, and PDK1 phosphorylation in
CT26 colon carcinoma cells. In contrast, the expression of
PTEN, which negatively regulates PI3K-AKT signaling,
is significantly induced by STS.
Colon carcinoma cells cultured under starvation
conditions exhibit a significant reduction of glucose
avidity and consumption. GLUT1, a member of the
GLUT (SLC2A) family of membrane transporters that
mediates glucose import, is frequently overexpressed
in many cancers. Its inhibition can overcome tumor
chemoresistance and improve the therapeutic effect of
chemodrugs [31-33]. In CT26 cells, glucose intake is
known to be mainly dependent on GLUT1 and GLUT2
whose expression levels are dramatically down-regulated
by STS. Glucose consumption and the start of the
glycolytic process in cancer depends on HK II whose
catalytic function is largely empowered by its p-AKTdependent binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane
[34]. We show that STS hampers this association which
may limit the preferential access of HK II to ATP for
glucose-6-phosphate production. STS also appears to
inhibit PFK,PK and LDH activity, which will directly
inhibit the rate-limiting steps of glycolytic flux. In
agreement with the results above, STS dramatically
reduces the lactate released by CT26 cells, likely due to
the concomitant down-regulation of MCT1/Scl16a1 and
CD147 (data not shown).The acidification of the tumor
microenvironment due to high levels of exported lactate
can hamper antitumor immune responses and favor
tumor metastasis [35,36]. Also, intracellular lactate may
be converted to pyruvate by LDH and used as a nutrient
source for oxidative metabolism and/or gluconeogenesis.
Marked increase of LDHA, MCT1/4 and CD147 levels
correlate with cancer progression and drug resistance
[37-39] and the targeting of LDHA and MCT has been
proposed as a cancer therapy [40-44]. Thus, the effect

described [55]. In some experiments, CT26 cells were preincubated with 50 µM Rotenone (Sigma) 5 minutes before
performing O2 measure.

Bioluminescent luciferase ATP assay
Fifty micrograms of CT26 cell proteins were
incubated in an appropriate buffer plus 5 mM pyruvate
and 2.5 mM malate as described in [56] and ATP synthesis
was then induced adding 0.1 mM ADP. ATP concentration
was measured in a luminometer (Lumi-Scint, Bioscan) by
the luciferin/luciferase chemiluminescent method [57]. In
some experiments, CT26 cells were pre-incubated with 50
µM Rotenone (Sigma) 5 minutes before performing ATP
measure. In all experiments the ATP synthesis rate was
linear for the first 2 minutes.

Immunofluorescence analysis
CT26 cells were incubated with MitoTracker probe
(Life Technologies Italia, Monza, Italy) and treated as
previously described [50]. Coverslips were incubated
overnight with rabbit anti-HKI (C35C4) or anti-HKII
(C64G5) primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies,
Leiden, The Netherlands). Specific staining was visualized
with a goat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary
antibody (Molecular Probe® Life Technology), washed
and mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fading reagent (Life
Technologies). Results were analyzed using an Olympus
(Olympus Optical) laser-scanning microscope FV500
equipped with an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope and
Argon ion 488 nm, He-Ne 543 nm, and He-Ne 633 nm
lasers. Digital images were acquired through a PLAPO
60× objective, with the Fluoview 4.3b software program,
sequentially as single trans-cellular optical sections.
Spatial co-localization was analyzed by Image J 1.34f
software (NIH).

Proteomic analysis
The MS instrument was operated in data-dependent
mode to automatically switch between full-scan MS and
MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra were
acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with resolution R =
60,000. The 20 most intense peptide ions with charge
states ≥ 2 were sequentially isolated and fragmented
by collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the LTQ
mass spectrometer. Raw mass spectrometric data were
analyzed using the MaxQuant pipeline [58]. Moreover
quantification and data normalization were achieved by
an intensity-based label-free approach using MaxQuant.
Thanks to the implementation of maximal peptide ratio
extraction and delayed normalization algorithms, the
MaxLFQ program included in MaxQuant, provide
accurate XIC-based quantification [59]. The statistical
and the pathways analysis have been made with the
freely available Perseus (www.perseusframework.org/
Perseus_1.4.1.3.zip) and Cytoscape software respectively
[60].

Western blotting
The antibodies used were as follows: anti-PTEN
(Millipore), anti-Phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-PhosphoPDK1, anti-PI3K, anti-HKII, anti-PFK1, anti-PKM2,
anti-β-actin (all from Cell Signaling), and anti-GLUT1,
GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4 (all from Cell Abcam, United
Kingdom).

Spectrophotometric enzymes assay

Microarray

Glycolytic enzymes were assayed at room
temperature on 25 μg of CT26 cells protein, in a double
beam spectrophotometer (UNICAM UV2, Analytical
S.n.c., Italy) as previously described [51]. The activity
assay of the redox complexes I, II, III, IV was evaluated
as described in [52, 53]. ATP and AMP were measured
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RNA was extracted from cell lines using RNeasy
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was assessed
in the BioAnalyzer (Agilent, St. Clara, CA). cDNA, dscDNA and cRNA synthesis was performed using the 3’

cases, the labeling procedure did not affect cell viability
as documented by Trypan blue staining.

IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cRNAs
were purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen),
controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected
to fragmentation for 35 min. at 94°C in fragmentation
buffer (40mM Tris-acetate pH 8.1, 100mM CH3COOH,
30mM Mg(CH3COOH)2x4H2O). Hybridization, washing
and staining were performed using the GeneAtlas®
Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit for 3’ IVT Arrays
(Affymetrix, St. Clara, CA).

In vivo micro-PET
Mice were weighted and anesthesia was induced by
ip administration of ketamine (100 mg/Kg) (IMALGERE
1000, Milan, Italy)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) (BIO98 Srl,
Milan, Italy). Serum glucose level was tested and animals
were positioned on the bed of a dedicated micro-PET
system (Albira, Carestream Inc, US) whose two-ring
configuration permits to cover the whole animal body in a
single bed position. A dose of 3-4 MBq of FDG was then
injected through a tail vein, soon after start of a list mode
acquisition lasting 50 minutes.

Mouse models
To establish a subcutaneous cancer mouse
model, 6 week-old female BALB/c mice were injected
subcutaneously in the lower back with 100 µL CT26
colon cancer cells resuspended in PBS at a density of
2x106 cells/mL (2x105 cells/mouse). Five days after tumor
cell inoculum, when tumors were palpable, the animals
were subdivided into four groups: “Controls” (N=7) with
tumor and no treatment which were kept under standard
conditions for the whole duration of the study; “STS”
animals (N=7) that were submitted to 48-hour STS, “OXP”
mice (N=7) treated with OXP for 24 hours, “STS+OXP”
mice (N=7) submitted to both treatments. At the end of all
treatments mice were submitted to micro-PET imaging.
STS consisted in a complete food deprivation with free
access to water. “STS” mice were individually housed in a
clean new cage to reduce cannibalism and were monitored
daily for weight loss and general behavior. “OXP” mice
were inoculated intraperitoneally (ip) with OXP at 10 mg/
Kg and housed in the presence of food. Tumor size was
measured by caliper and tumor volume was calculated
using the following equation: tumor volume (mm3) =
(length × width × height) x π/6, expressing length, width
and height in mm.

In vivo image processing
PET data were reconstructed using a maximal
likelihood expectation maximization method (MLEM).
An experienced observer, unaware of the experimental
type of analyzed mouse, identified a volume of interest
(VOI) in the left ventricular chamber. Then, the computer
was asked to plot the time-concentration curve within this
VOI throughout the whole acquisition to define tracer
input function. Whole body FDG clearance (in ml x min-1)
was calculated using the conventional stochastic approach
as the ratio between injected dose and integral of input
function from 0 to infinity, fitting the last 20 minutes with
a mono-exponential function [62]. A further VOI was
drawn over cancer lesion to measure maximal standardized
uptake value (SUV), i.e. the most commonly accepted
index of tissue FDG uptake, expressed as the fraction of
injected tracer dose normalized for body weight.
Tumor glucose consumption was expressed in nM X
min-1 X g-1 and was estimated in this last VOI according to
Gjedde-Patlak [63] graphical analysis by using the routine
of a dedicated software (PMOD, Zurich, Switzerland).
Briefly, the software utilizes the input function to
transform the original tissue activity measurements
by fitting the data in each voxel with the slope of the
regression line defined by the model. In all cases, lumped
constant value was set at 1.

Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake evaluation
Daily quality controls always documented adequate
standards and, in particular, a radiochemical purity ≥
98%. Labeling was performed by incubating 106 cells
with FDG according to a procedure validated in our
laboratory [50, 61]. Immediately before the experiment,
glucose free medium was added with two mL PBS
containing FDG at a concentration of 37 KBq/mL.
Tracer exposure was maintained for 60 minutes at 37°C.
Thereafter, the uptake process was stopped by adding 4
ml of PBS before centrifugation at 450 g for 10 minutes.
Supernatant was removed and cell pellet re-suspended in
1ml of saline buffer. Free and bound activities were thus
simultaneously counted using a Packard Cobra II gamma
counter (Packard, Meriden, CT) with a 10% energy
window centered at 511KeV. FDG retention was measured
as the ratio between bound and total radioactivity. In all

Statistical analysis
The in vivo data are presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). For comparison between different groups,
the Null hypothesis was tested by a single factor analysis
of variance (ANOVA) for multiple groups. Statistical
significance was considered for p values p<0.05.
For in vitro experiments, the statistical significance
of differences between experimental and control groups
was assessed by Unpaired t test with Welch’s correction
