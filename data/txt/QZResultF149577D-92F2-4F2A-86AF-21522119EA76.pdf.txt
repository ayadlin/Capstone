ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a highly prevalent and deadly brain malignancy
characterized by poor prognosis and restricted disease management potential. Despite
the success of nanocarrier systems to improve drug/gene therapy for cancer, active
targeting specificity remains a major hurdle for GBM. Additionally, since the brain is
a multi-cell type organ, there is a critical need to develop an approach to distinguish
between GBM cells and healthy brain cells for safe and successful treatment. In this
report, we have incorporated hyaluronic acid (HA) as an active targeting ligand for
GBM. To do so, we employed HA conjugated liposomes (HALNPs) to study the uptake
pathway in key cells in the brain including primary astrocytes, microglia, and human
GBM cells. We observed that the HALNPs specifically target GBM cells over other
brain cells due to higher expression of CD44 in tumor cells. Furthermore, CD44 driven
HALNP uptake into GBM cells resulted in lysosomal evasion and increased efficacy of
Doxorubicin, a model anti-neoplastic agent, while the astrocytes and microglia cells
exhibited extensive HALNP-lysosome co-localization and decreased antineoplastic
potency. In summary, novel CD44 targeted lipid based nanocarriers appear to be
proficient in mediating site-specific delivery of drugs via CD44 receptors in GBM cells,
with an improved therapeutic margin and safety.

INTRODUCTION

[5]. However, these treatment measures instigate systemic
toxic effects to healthy tissue, are limited in potency by
intrinsic resistance pathways, require regular invasive dose
regimens, and overall do not provide improved long-term
quality of life for the patient. Therefore there is a critical
need to develop a novel approach that can overcome
current limitations and alleviate the burden of GBM.
Brain tumors are categorized according to the glial
type they are most histologically similar, location of the
tumor, and overall phenotypical behavior [6]. Brain tumor
microenvironment also consists of other cells including
glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) that are a class of
non-neuronal brain cells. Astrocytomas including GBM
are most similar to astrocytes, and therefore it is crucial
to ensure that any targeting approach developed for GBM

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most
aggressive, lethal, and prevalent brain malignancy with
over 10,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States each
year [1, 2] GBM is specifically a grade IV astrocytoma
histologically defined by abnormal cellularity, mitotic
activity, vascular proliferation, and necrosis leading
to a highly mobile and invasive phenotype capable of
infiltrating surrounding brain tissue [3]. Consequently,
GBM is characterized by poor prognosis, restricted disease
management potential, and a less than 1 year median
survival rate [4]. Current widespread clinical treatment
options for GBM include radiation therapy, chemotherapy
with antineoplastic agents, and maximal tumor resection

treatment must be able to 1) distinguish between GBM
cancer cells and healthy astrocytes, and 2) evade rapid
phagocytosis by microglial cells. A promising method for
active targeting to cancer cells is the exploitation of the
differential expression of CD44. CD44 is a cell membranebound surface receptor that mediates cell-cell and
cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) communication [7–11],
and has been found to be increased in numerous cancer
types including breast [12], lung [13], colorectal [14]
tumors compared to basal expression in equivalent healthy
tissue [15]. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a main component of
the ECM, is a natural ligand to CD44 has been used as
a targeting moiety for CD44 overexpressing cancers,
facilitating preferential uptake and potent therapeutic
efficacy [16–22]. Recently, CD44 has also been found to
be increased in glioma cells compared to healthy astrocytes
[23, 24], and has been implicated to directly impact glioma
invasion [24, 25]. Although these findings are extremely
exciting, only a few studies involving an HA decorated
nanocarrier have been examined as a potential CD44
targeted GBM therapy [26, 27]. Furthermore, no studies
to date have performed an in-depth analysis probing the
true merit of HA as a natural ligand to preferentially bind
and internalize into GBM cells over healthy glial cells.
Recently, liposomes and lipid-based nanocarriers
have demonstrated robust efficacy in drug and gene
therapy comprising precise coordinates of the body
such as the brain [28–31]. The successful application of
liposome nanocarriers has been catalyzed by targeted
delivery and subsequent preferential intracellular uptake
via either passive (diffusion driven accumulation and local
cell uptake) or active (explicit cell receptor driven uptake)
mechanisms [32–37]. Although passive approaches have
been employed extensively via implementation of the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, the
advent of biomarker identification coupled to pathological
categorization has greatly improved the efficacy,
selectivity, and overall safety of liposome therapeutic
delivery. From this approach, liposomes can be surface
decorated with receptor recognition ligands including
antibodies, aptamers, peptides, and integrins to facilitate
targeting of specific biomarkers that are identified in
disease states. For example, EGFR [38], Folate Receptor
[39, 40], and HER2 [41] directed nanotherapies have
significantly improved global cancer treatment via cell
specific endocytosis of therapeutic cargo. In regards to
GBM therapy, a wide array of active recognition ligands
have been utilized to date including the peptide sequences
IL13 [42, 43], CGKRK [44], Pep1 [45], activatable low
molecular weight protamine [46], and chlorotoxin [47],
antibodies such as EGFRvIII [48], low density lipoprotein
receptor related proteins [49, 50], and the GMT8 aptamer
[51]. These targeting moieties have exploited GBM cell
specific membrane signatures with varying levels of
success to deliver numerous drug types including the
chemotherapeutics doxorubicin [43] and paclitaxel [49],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

antisense oligonucleotides/silencing RNAs [4, 47], peptide
based therapeutics such as KLAKLAK [44], inhibitors
[52, 53], and other therapeutic cargo types [54–56] for
GBM management. While encouraging, there is limited
knowledge on how the different cell types in the brain,
specifically glial cells, influence the uptake selectivity of
active GBM targeted therapy.
In this study we investigated the potential of
implementing HA as a surface bound targeting moiety
for liposome GBM therapy. To do so, we employed
our previously optimized high molecular weight HA
conjugated liposomes (HALNPs) to study the uptake
pathway in key cells in the brain including primary
astrocytes, microglia (MG), and human GBM cells [22, 57].
Specifically, three GBM cells lines were utilized: invasive
and non-tumorigenic (A172 cells), non-invasive and slightly
tumorigenic (U251), and invasive and highly tumorigenic
(U87MG). From this approach, we determined the rate and
overall extent of HA coated liposome intracellular delivery
to astrocytes, microglial, and GBM cells, as well as probed
the capacity of each cell type to implement CD44 stimulated
uptake and the resultant effect on nanoparticle endolysosomal
fate. A potency assay employing doxorubicin in both the free
form and encapsulated inside HA coated liposomes was also
performed to validate the robust influence of targeted therapy
on the selectivity and efficacy of GBM treatment. We believe
this information is significant in the development of novel
GBM nano-therapies, and will catalyze the usage of CD44
targeting for the treatment of GBM.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design and characterization of hyaluronic acid
coated liposomes (HALNPs)
To investigate the potential of using hyaluronic
acid (HA) as a targeting ligand for GBM therapy, we
first engineered an HA conjugated nanocarrier system
following our previously optimized protocol [22, 57].
The liposome nanoparticles (LNPs) were made from the
biocompatible constituents PC, DPPE, and CHOL in a
3:1:1 molar ratio and doped with 0.15 mass % fluorescent
cholesterol as a tracker. The LNPs were surface decorated
with high molecular weight HA (HALNPs) via an EDC
facilitated amide bond formation between the carboxyl
group of the HA and the primary amine of the DPPE
lipid head group as seen in Figure 1A. Initial validation
of significant surface functionalization was determined
by size and charge characterization (Table 1). Bare
LNPs were 95.0 ± 0.7 nm in hydrodynamic diameter
with a polydispersity index (PI) of 0.032, and increased
in size to 126.6 ± 5.62 nm with a PI of 0.157 following
the crosslinking of HA. The charge of the particles also
dropped from −5.74 ± 2.24 to −23.64 ± 1.49 mV due to
the presence of the excess carboxylic acid groups of the
HA on the surface of the liposomes. HA surface decoration

Preferential uptake of HALNPs by glioblastoma
cells over healthy glial cells

was also confirmed by TEM analysis visually depicting
the increase in nanoparticle size and surface roughness
(Figure 1B). High magnification confocal microscopy
was also employed to demonstrate the fluorescent nature
of the HALNPs due to the fluorescent tracker in the lipid
bilayer (Figure 1C). The rationale for using high molecular
weight HA (1.65 MDa) to the LNPs was previous studies
have demonstrated that high molecular weight HA is antiinflammatory and has a high binding affinity to CD44
[19]. Also from our previous study, we demonstrated that
crosslinking the LNPs with high MW Hyaluronic Acid
(HA) did not increase the particle size and underwent no
significant change in net surface charge after lyophilization
[22]. We also demonstrated that encapsulation of a range
of molecular weight of FITC-tagged Dextran (FD) (10, 20,
and 70 kDa) as model drugs did not change the HALNP
size. Following nanoparticle design and characterization,
we then utilized our HALNP nanocarrier system to
examine uptake rate and extent in both GBM and healthy
glial cells.

The brain is a multi-cell type organ comprising
primarily of neurons and a spectrum of glial cells.
Consequently, any targeted drug delivery to the brain must
facilitate preferential uptake by the cell of interest in order
to achieve higher potency, reduce offsite toxicity, and
overall promote a positive therapeutic outcome. To test the
true merit of HA driven active targeting for GBM therapy,
we utilized comprehensive cell cultures consisting of
primary rat astrocytes, primary mouse microglia cells, and
human GBM cells. In addition to being the most abundant
cell type, astrocytes were included in our model system
because primary astrocytoma brain tumors including
GBM are most similar to astrocyte cells and therefore they
represent a targeting hurdle. Furthermore, we included
primary astrocytes from both the cortical (Cort Astro)
and cerebellum (Cereb Astro) regions of the brain due to
their high correlation with GBM onset [58]. Microglial

decoration, and (C) by high magnification confocal microscopy to illustrate the fluorescent nature of the HALNPs due to the lipid bilayer

(MG) cells were incorporated in our model system
because they are scavenger cells that readily degrade
any foreign material in the brain [59], and thus must be
evaded for optimal treatment efficacy. Lastly, GBM cells
were integrated into our brain model to represent the
delivery target. Specifically, three GBM cells lines were
selected to obtain results spanning different source donors
as well as to probe the potential of treating GBM cells
with varying phenotypical properties such as invasive and
non-tumorigenic (A172 cells), non-invasive and slightly
tumorigenic (U251), and invasive and highly tumorigenic
(U87MG) [60].
The targeting capacity of HA was directly assessed
in GBM cells along with MG and astrocytes using flow
cytometry analysis (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 2).
Flow cytometry was chosen due to its ability to examine
uptake simultaneously in both a population wide
(Figure 2B) and per cell basis (Figure 2C). Prior to
analysis, all six cell types were seeded at low density to
ensure the uptake data acquired was indicative of per-cell
behavior (Supplementary Figure 3). Following a three
hour incubation time with the HALNPs, the cerebellum
and cortical astrocytes exhibited 29.3% and 32% positive
populations for HALNP uptake, and a 10 and 6.7 fold
change in per cell fluorescence, respectively. At the same
time point, the MG cells had a 37.7% positive population,
and a 14.5 fold change in per cell fluorescence, while the
A172, U251, and U87MG GBM cells achieved 77.7%,
34.5%, and 52.5% positive populations with 153.4, 87.3,
and 133.3 fold change in per cell fluorescence, respectively.
This significant difference in HALNP uptake between the
glial (astrocytes and microglial) and the GBM cells was
further corroborated by quantitative confocal microscopy
at the analogous three hour time point (Figure 2D,
Supplementary Figure 3).
Flow cytometry was also performed after a 12 hour
incubation with HALNPs to reveal if the differential
cell uptake patterns were transient or long lived via a
preferential mechanism. Following this incubation time,
the cerebellum and cortical astrocytes had a 57.8% and
52.9% positive population and a 43.8 and a 28.6 fold
change in per cell fluorescence, respectively. Furthermore,
the MG cells reached a 57.7% population and a 54.3
fold change in fluorescence, while the A172, U251, and
U87MG GBM cells attained 84.1%, 61.8%, and a 55%
positive populations with 314.6, 233.3 and 161.7 fold
change in per cell fluorescence, respectively. This set of
experiments demonstrated the potential of employing

HALNPs for targeting GBM cells. In addition, the results
obtained seem to indicate that HA may be binding with
the GBM cells differently than the healthy glial cells to
facilitate preferential intracellular delivery. We have
earlier shown that CD44 promotes uptake of HA coated
liposomes in breast cancer over corresponding healthy
breast tissue [22], and thus we hypothesize this receptor
endocytosis route may be a driving force for favored GBM
uptake.

Differential expression of CD44 facilitates active
targeting of glioblastoma cells
CD44 is a cell surface receptor commonly exploited
for targeted therapy for a range of cancer types [61]. To
investigate if the preferential uptake of HALNPs to GBM
cells over astrocytes and MGs is driven by CD44 we first
performed western blot to quantify total CD44 protein
levels in all six cells types (Figure 3, Supplementary
Figure 4). From this analysis we found that CD44
is expressed lowest in both cerebellum and cortical
astrocytes, higher in the GBM cells, and highest in
the MG cells. By using the cerebellum astrocytes as a
comparison baseline for CD44 expression, we found that
cortical astrocytes, MG, A172, U251, and U87MG GBM
cells had a 2, 5, 3.3, 3.8, and 3.9 fold higher expression,
respectively. This data agrees with recent findings that
CD44 expression is increased in glioma cells as compared
to healthy astrocytes [23, 24]. Furthermore, the high
expression of CD44 in MG cells was not surprising
because CD44 has been shown to play a role in regulation
of macrophage phagocytosis and inflammation pathways
[62, 63]. We hypothesize that the CD44 receptors on the
MG cells are not functional compared to the ones on
GBM cells (at least to high MW HA). Recent studies have
demonstrated that CD44 functionality, not necessarily
the expression, defines its potential for targeted therapy
[64]. We believe that this might be the potential reason
for lower uptake of HALNPs in MG cells even when the
CD44 expression is the highest in the cells.
A saturation experiment was then performed to
precisely block the CD44 receptor to discern if the
increase in total CD44 expression translated to a higher
uptake of the HALNPs (Figure 4). Each of the cell types
was pre-treated with excess HA prior to the addition of
the HALNPs, and then the per-cell fluorescence was
directly compared between the pre-treated and non-pretreated samples. The percent difference in uptake was

then used as a quantitative measure as to the capacity
of each specific cell type to employ CD44-HA receptor
endocytosis of the HALNPs. From this analysis we
found that both cerebellum and cortical astrocytes do not

internalize HALNPs via a CD44 driven route, and thus
any uptake into these cells must be facilitated by nonspecific interactions. Similarly, HA pre-treatment did
not significantly influence HALNP uptake in MG cells

measure HALNP uptake via (A) histogram, (B) population wide, and (C) per-cell fluorescence following a 3 and 12 hour incubation time

cell type at the previous time point; n = 4). For each cell type, control cells (no HALNPs) were used to create a lower limit-gating event
to remove cell specific auto-fluorescence. (D) Quantitative confocal microscopy was also performed following an analogous three hours

CD44 stimulated uptake of HALNPs leads to
endolysosomal escape in GBM cells

although they exhibited the highest total CD44 expression.
We postulate this is due to the vast amount of different
uptake mechanisms employed by MG for immune defense,
as well as possible activation state of the MG cells. In
contrast, A172, U251, and U87MG GBM cells were found
to significantly employ CD44 stimulated uptake yielding
a percent difference in per-cell fluorescence of 36%, 48%,
and 76%, respectively. Following validation that CD44
facilitates targeted GBM uptake, we next investigated how
the CD44 pathway influences intracellular distribution of
the HALNPs.

Nanoscale drug delivery systems are commonly
hindered in application by inefficient intracellular delivery
and subsequent lysosome driven degradation [65].
Therefore, recent efforts have focused on finding ways
to simultaneously facilitate targeted uptake and evade
lysosome localization [66]. To examine the intracellular
distribution of HALNPs as a function of CD44 receptor
employment, we performed live cell confocal microscopy

to visualize the HALNP-lysosome co-localization
patterns. The goal of this experiment was to directly test
if cells that exploit CD44 driven uptake (GBM cells) have
different HALNP intracellular fate than that of cells that
do not readily utilize CD44 (astrocytes, and to a lesser
extent MG). For this analysis, we chose cortical
astrocytes, MG, and A172 as representative cells for
each cell type, and incubated the cells with HALNPs for
five hours prior to confocal investigation. Using high
magnification confocal microscopy and z axis slicing
(Figure 5A), we observed that cortical astrocytes and
MG cells displayed extensive HALNP co-localization
with lysosomes. This high occurrence of co-localization
was expected in cortical astrocytes and MG cells
because a majority of non-specific uptake mechanisms
except caveolae- culminate their endocytosis pathway
by fusion with lysosomes [67]. Alternatively, the A172

cells had significantly less HALNP co-localization with
lysosomes following intracellular delivery. This evasion
of lysosomal degradation agreed with our previous
findings of HALNP intracellular fate with breast cancer
cells that also strongly employ CD44 mediated uptake
[22], as well as other studies using HA as a targeting
moiety [68–70]. To further authenticate that the HALNPs
achieved cytoplasmic escape in the A172 cells following
CD44 driven uptake, we then performed confocal
microscopy with z-axis transformation (Figure 5B).
This technique allowed for the direct visualization of
HALNPs in comparison to an internal reference frame
(in our case the cell nucleus), and fostered confidence that
HALNPs achieved homogenous cytoplasmic distribution
with minimal lysosomal co-localization. Following this
in-depth confocal analysis, we began to hypothesize that
the combination of preferential uptake and lysosomal

length respectively). For both confocal analyses a five hour incubation time was implemented and the scale bar is 10 micron.

evasion in GBM cells as opposed to the non-specific
uptake and lysosomal co-localization of healthy glial cells
may lead to enhanced potency and reduced offsite toxicity
for HALNP facilitated GBM therapy.

DOX for the Cort astro, MG, and A172 cells, respectively
(Table 2). This result was extremely exciting because it
clearly shows the significant advantage of employing HA
as an active GBM targeting ligand.
To further probe the specificity of HA mediated
targeting, we also performed a 24 hour potency assay
with the three cells types utilizing DOX in its free form,
not associated with a nanocarrier, over the analogous
concentration range (Supplementary Figure 5). From this
assay we found that DOX was less potent in the cortical
astrocytes and most potent in the A172 cells. The LC50
values were measured to be 0.322 ± 0.053, 0.267 ± 0.050,
and 0.193 ± 0.030 μg/ml DOX for the Cort astro, MG,
and A172 cells, respectively (Table 2). These results are
possibly due to the mechanism of action of DOX that
includes interfering with the replication process, thus
resulting in greater toxicity in more rapidly dividing
cells. In addition to providing valuable data regarding
the potency of DOX in its free form, this experiment also
validated the targeting capacity of HA. By comparing
the HALNP-DOX LC50 to the free DOX LC50 for each
specific cell type, the therapeutic influence of specificity
was quantified. For the cortical astrocytes, the LC50 value
significantly increased 59% by utilizing the HALNP
system over free DOX. Similarly, LC50 value increased
by 19% by due to delivery of DOX encapsulated in the
HALNPs system to the MG cells. These results exemplify
that the HALNP nanoparticles are not readily internalized
into healthy glial cells, and thus the HALNP nanocarrier
may reduce the chance of offsite toxicity for GBM

HALNPs increase the delivery selectivity and
overall efficacy of chemotherapeutic GBM
therapy
The therapeutic potential of HA as a targeting ligand
for GBM treatment was directly tested by encapsulating
Doxorubicin into the HALNPs and performing a
24 hour potency assay with cortical astrocytes, MG, and
A172 cells. Doxorubicin (DOX) was chosen as a model
chemotherapeutic cargo due to its broad cancer therapy
repertoire, including efforts at GBM management [71, 72].
Following our previous protocol for DOX encapsulation
into the HALNPs (HALNP-DOX) [57], a Lipid:DOX mass
ratio of 2.88:1 was achieved and the final DOX loaded
particles were 167.8 ± 9.2 nm in size, −21.19 ± 5.2 mV
in charge, and had a PI of 0.241. We seeded the three cell
types overnight and then performed a potency assay the
next morning over the DOX range (encapsulated DOX)
of 0 to 10 μg/ml. Following the 24 hour incubation time,
a standard MTT viability assay was used to determine
the lethal concentration to kill 50% of the cell population
(LC50) (Figure 6). This assay demonstrated that the
LC50 of HALNP encapsulated DOX for the A172 cells
was nearly 5 fold lower than the LC50 for the cortical
astrocytes, and nearly 3 fold lower than the LC50 for the
MG cells. Specifically, the LC50 values were found to be

therapy. However, the LC50 value decreased significantly
by 41% for the A172 GBM cells via employment of the
HALNP system. This experiment confirmed that the
HALNP system increases the overall efficacy and safety
of chemotherapeutic GBM therapy. Furthermore, the
acquired results agree with another study that found that
HA targeted liposomes increased the potency of DOX
for CD44 positive melanoma, but decreased the potency
of DOX when the CD44 active uptake mechanism was
removed [73].

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the
vast potential of HA facilitated active targeting for GBM
nano-therapy. Although the cell surface receptor CD44
has been found to be increased in GBM cells, only a few
studies have been conducted implementing HA decorated
nanocarriers for GBM treatment. Furthermore, no studies
to date have performed an in-depth analysis probing the
true merit of HA as a natural ligand to favorably target
GBM cells over healthy glial cells. This is the first
study known to the authors to employ a comprehensive
in vitro brain model containing healthy glial cells such
as astrocytes and microglia as well as multiple types of
glioblastoma cells in combination with a translational
HA coated nanocarrier to test the targeting capacity and
specificity of HA for GBM treatment. From this analysis
we found that HA promotes preferential uptake, facilitates
intracellular lysosomal evasion, and significantly enhances
chemotherapeutic potency in GBM cells while eluding
uptake in astrocytes and MG cells. We believe these
findings are significant and will promote the widespread
implementation of HA for nanoscale GBM therapy and
other brain malignancies. In addition to nanocarriers,
we believe these results will also further catalyze CD44
inhibitors as a method for GBM suppression. In the
future we plan on harnessing the GBM targeting power
of HALNPs with our previously optimized substrate
mediated HALNP delivery platform (HALNP-PEM) [57]
to create an implantable device to occupy the cavity of
resected GBM tumors to promote local, sustained, and
targeted therapy and thus bring visible advancement to
GBM management.

Lipid nanoparticle fabrication and hyaluronic
acid surface decoration
Multilamellar vesicles were made from PC,
DPPE, and CHOL in a 3:1:1 molar ratio and doped with
0.15 mass% FCHOL (as a tracker) by applying the dry lipid
film technique, mechanically extruded to the nanoscale,
and surface decorated with HA as described earlier [22, 57].
Briefly, extrusion was carried out in a stepwise manner
at 65°C ensuring product homogeneity and a final lipid
nanoparticle (LNP) diameter in the 80–100 nm range.
Following LNP purification via ultracentrifugation to
remove any excess lipid debris (1.5 hr, 135,000 g), the
primary amine of the DPPE lipid head group was amide
bonded to the carboxylic acid group of EDC-activated
HA to form HA decorated LNPs (HALNPs) following
standard crosslinking protocol. The HALNPs were then
purified form excess crosslinking reagents and either 1)
stored at 4°C and used within 2 weeks of creation or 2)
snap froze and lyophilized following previous protocol
for drug entrapment experiments [22]. Lyophilized HA
coated particles were observed to be stable for over two
months when stored at −80°C (Supplementary Table 1).
To determine the effect of HALNP membrane fluidity on
the kinetics of drug release, the molar ratio of cholesterol

was varied from 20 to 25 % and a model therapeutic cargo,
FITC tagged Dextran, was encapsulated into the aqueous
core of the HALNPs following previous protocol [22]
(Supplementary Figure 6). Although the higher cholesterol
formulation extended drug release profiles, this higher
cholesterol content was found to reduce encapsulation
efficiency. As a result, 20 mol % particles were chosen as
the optimized HALNP composition.

mouse granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) from Life Technologies was added to each
seeded flask at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and replenished
every 3 days.
GBM cell lines
A172 (ATCC: CRL1620) human glioblastoma cell
line was grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% PS. U251 (Sigma) human glioblastoma
astrocytoma and U87MG (ATCC: HTB14) human grade
IV astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines were grown in
MEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PS, 1%
NEAA, and 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (all stated reagents
from Thermo Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA).

Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential
characterization
Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of
the LNPs and HA coated LNPs was measured using a
Brookhaven NanoBrook ZetaPALS zeta potential and
dynamic light scattering instrument (Holtsville, NY,
USA). The nanoparticle size was measured as an intensity
averaged distribution using a scattering angle of 90°. The
Smoluchowki model was utilized to calculate the zeta
potential from mobility measurements. All measurements
were performed in 0.05 × PBS (pH 7.4) at 25°C.

Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed employing a
FACSCantoII from Becton Dickenson (Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA). Each of the six cell types of the in vitro brain
model were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells per well
in a 12 well plate layout and allowed to incubate overnight
to facilitate cell attachment. After this incubation time,
HALNPs fluorescently doped with 0.15 mass % FCHOL
as a tracker were added to the cells at a concentration of
105 µg lipid per well and incubated for 3 or 12 hours.
Directly after this incubation time, the cells were washed
three times with sterile 1X PBS, trypsinized, and measured
for per cell and population wide fluorescence (ex. 495,
em. 520; 10,000 total events/read). By reading control
cells without the addition of HALNPs, a lower limit
gating event was created to remove cell specific auto
fluorescence.

Transmission electron microscopy
The phosphotungstic negative stain method was
utilized for visualization of the LNP system following
previous protocol [22]. A drop of either LNP or HALNP
was applied to a carbon film coated copper grid and left
to air dry at room temperature. Phosphotungstic acid
solution promoted negative staining, and the samples were
analyzed in the UNL Microscopy Core Research Facility’s
TEM model Hitachi H7500 (Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan).

Cell culture

Confocal microscopy

All cells were cultured in aseptic conditions
following standard cell culture protocol and stored in an
incubator set at 37°C with 5% CO2.

An Inverted confocal microscope (Olympus IX 81)
at the UNL Microscopy Core Research Facility was used
for four separate experiments:

Primary cortical and cerebellum astrocytes

Confocal of the fluorescently tagged HALNPs

Primary cortical (Cort) and cerebellum (Cereb)
astrocytes were prepared from 1–2 day-old Charles River
(Wilmington, MA, USA) Sprague-Dawley rat pups from
four donor rats yielding 12+ pups per litter in compliance
with UNL’s IACUC protocol 1046 as described previously
[74]. Briefly, the Cort and Cereb brain regions were
isolated, digested with trypsin and DNase, filtered through
a 70 micron filter, centrifuged, and suspended in complete
culture media prior to seeding. The Cort and Cereb
Astrocytes were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% PS from Life Technologies (Grand
Island, NY, USA).

FCHOL doped HALNPs were diluted to 55 ng/ml in
1× PBS and the solution was viewed at 100× magnification
with optical zoom using a cover slip (ex. 495, em. 520).
Quantitative HALNP Uptake between the in Vitro
brain model
Cort Astro, Cereb Astro, MG, A172, U251, and
U87MG cells were seeded at 230,000 cells per 35 mm glass
bottom dish from Mattek (Ashland, MA, USA) overnight
to promote cell attachment. The next morning, 1.58 mg/ml
HALNP was added per dish and incubated for 3 hours.
During the final half hour of the incubation, cellular nuclei
were stained with Hoerscht (Thermo Scientific) following
stated protocol. Subsequent to the staining procedure,
each dish was washed 3× with sterile 1× PBS and kept
in HEPES buffered media without phenol red during the

Primary microglia (MG)
Mouse microglia were grown in macrophage serum
free media containing L-glutamine and supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% PS. Additionally, recombinant

confocal visualization. A constant laser intensity was used
to take photos at 20× and 60× for each cell type for a
quantitative measurement of HALNP uptake.

DOX potency assay

Lysosomal co-localization

Doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated inside the
aqueous core of the HALNPs as previously described
[57]. Briefly, a vial of lyophilized HALNPs (0.5 mg lipid)
was brought to room temperature, and rehydrated with
1/10th its original pre-lyophilized volume of 0.05 × PBS
containing 250 μg DOX. Following a thirty minute
incubation time to allow for lipid membrane re-assembly,
the vial was brought back to its full pre-lyophilized
volume with 1 × PBS and ultracentrifuged to remove
non-encapsulated DOX (140,000 g, 4°C, and 1.25 hr.).
The auto-fluorescent nature of DOX was then employed
to determine the entrapment payload. A standard curve
consisting of a known amount of DOX was compared to
0.1% triton X-100 permeabilized HALNPs to determine
the total encapsulated DOX. A final lipid to DOX mass
ratio of 2.88 to 1 was achieved with a 69.4% encapsulation
efficiency. These purified DOX containing particles are
referred to as HALNP-DOX.

Encapsulation of DOX into HALNPs

Cort Astro, MG, and A172 cells were seeded at
230,000 cells per 35 mm glass bottom dish from Mattek
overnight to promote cell attachment. The next morning,
1.58 mg/ml HALNP was added per dish and incubated for
5 hours, and the intracellular lysosomes and nuclei were
stained following previous protocol [22]. Following this
incubation time, the cells were washed and visualized at
100×. Z-axis slices were merged to display the occurrence
of HALNP-lysosome co-localization in each cell type.
Z-axis transformation with A172 Cells
A172 cells were seeded at 230,000 cells per glass
bottom plate, incubated with 1.58 mg/ml HALNP for
five hours, and the lysosomes and nuclei were stained.
A Z-axis transformation was then performed (100×
with optical zoom) using the stained cell nucleus as an
internal reference point. From this analysis, an XZ and
YZ plan were constructed to directly visualize cytoplasmic
HALNPs.

Cell seeding and HALNP-DOX addition
Cort Astro, MG, and A172 cells were seeded in
a 48 well plate at a density of 35,000 cells per well and
incubated overnight to facilitate cell attachment. The next
day following validation of homogenous cell attachment,
DOX in its free form (not associated with a nanocarrier)
or HALNP-DOX were added to select wells in a
concentration range of 0 to 10 μg/ml and left to incubate
for an additional 24 hours.

Western blot
Total protein was extracted from Cort Astro, Cereb
Astro, MG, A172, U251, and U87MG cells cultured on
standard TCPS surfaces by RIPA buffer induced cell
lysis and protein solubilization followed by the scraping
method. Western blotting was used to determine the
expression of the cell surface receptor CD44 in each of
the six brain cells. BCA protein quantification kit from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA) was used to quantify total
protein concentration, 25 μg total protein was loaded per
lane, the blot was run on a 7.5% tris-glycine SDS PAGE
homemade gel, the membrane was probed for CD44
(Abcam; ab24504), and protein bands were developed
and quantified by use of a LI-COR (Lincoln, NE, USA)
Odyssey FC and Image Studio Lite ver. 5.0 software,
respectively. GAPDH (Millipore; ABS16) expression was
measured as a normalization control for loading.

Free DOX and HALNP-DOX potency determination
– MTT assay
To determine the effect of free DOX and HALNPDOX on the cell viability of Cort Astro, MG and A172
cells, we utilized an MTT assay as previously reported to
calculate the lethal concentration to kill 50% of the cells
[57, 74, 75]. Following the 24 hour DOX incubation time,
the medium of the cells was aspirated, and sterile 5 mg/ml
MTT working solution was added and incubated for
2 hours at 37°C. The cells were then lysed with acidified
IPA and the absorbance of the produced formazan crystals
was measured using a Beckman Coulter AD340 plate
reader (Indianapolis, IN, USA). Percent viability was
determined by normalization of the 570/620 absorbance
ratio to the control untreated cells and positive control
dead cells (ethanol treated).

Saturation of CD44 receptor (competition assay)
Cort Astro, Cereb Astro, MG, A172, U251, and
U87MG cells were seeded overnight at a density of
100,000 cells per well in a 12 well plate. The next morning,
250 μg of HA was added to select wells and incubated for
1 hour at 37°C. Following this pre-treatment procedure,
105 μg fluorescently doped HALNPs were incubated with
the cells for three hours and then flow cytometry analysis
was used to directly measure the difference in per cell
fluorescence between the HA pre-treated samples and non
HA-pretreated samples (of analogous HALNP incubation
time and concentration).

Statistical analysis
The difference between experimental groups was
investigated by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and by a subsequent Turkey’s multiple comparison test in
Sigma Plot Software. For statistical analysis of all data,
p < 0.05 was regarded as the lowest acceptable threshold
for significance.
