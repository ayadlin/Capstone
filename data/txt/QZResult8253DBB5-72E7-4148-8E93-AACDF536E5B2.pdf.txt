BACKGROUND: Gefitinib and erlotinib are commonly used for salvage therapy in patients with nonsmall cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on prior therapies. Although both agents have similar structure and have demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC, gefitinib and erlotinib have not been directly compared in terms of efficacy and other
clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC who have failed prior chemotherapy. This prompted us to analyze the
clinical outcomes between gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC.
METHODS: A total of 467 patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC who had progressed on prior therapies and
received gefitinib or erlotinib therapy between January 2006 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. By
using a matched-pair case-control study design, 171 pairs of gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients were
matched according to sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, histologic type, and
smoking history. RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 58 years (range, 20-85 years), and the median ECOG
performance status was 1 (range, 0-3). Of 342 patients, 294 (86%) received an epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor as second-line or third-line therapy, whereas the remaining 14% had received >2
prior chemotherapy regimens before starting EGFR TK inhibitor therapy. The confirmed overall response rate was
35.1%, and the disease control rate was 64%. With 13.2 months of follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) for the
total 342 patients was 12.4 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10.66-14.14 months), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.65-3.75 months). The overall response rates and disease control
rates in the gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated groups were 38% versus 32.2% (P ¼.273) and 63.2% versus 64.9%,
respectively (P ¼.677). There was no statistically significant difference noted with regard to OS (median, 12.6 vs 12.1
months; P ¼ 0.99) and PFS (median, 4.6 vs 2.7 months; P ¼.06) between the gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated
groups. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis shows that gefitinib and erlotinib appear to have similar antitumor
activity in terms of response rate and OS in pretreated patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate any potential differences in toxicity and in dose intensity between gefitinibC 2010 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: gefitinib, erlotinib, nonsmall cell lung cancer, overall survival.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate of <15%, because most

patients are diagnosed with advanced stage disease.1-4 Similarly, in Korea, lung cancer has a 15.5% 5-year survival.5,6 Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that platinum-based combination chemotherapy is able
to induce a modest but significant survival advantage over best supportive care alone in patients with untreated advanced
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).4,7,8 However, most patients with advanced disease will eventually progress after
standard platinum-based combination chemotherapy. As the number of patients receiving first-line chemotherapy
increases, the need for effective second- or even third-line therapy has been increasing.
As cytotoxic agents, the most promising chemotherapies for patients who failed first-line therapy are docetaxel and
pemetrexed.9-11 Docetaxel improved survival and quality of life compared with best supportive care and compared with
an alternative single-agent treatment, vinorelbine or ifosfamide.10 Pemetrexed showed similar median survival of 8.3

months as compared with 7.9 months for docetaxel when
used as second-line chemotherapy.11 Both agents are
approved for advanced NSCLC in many countries as
monotherapy in the pretreated setting.
Representative molecularly targeted agents as a new
approach for improving outcomes in NSCLC are the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
(TK) inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.12-14 Gefitinib and
erlotinib are commonly used in patients with NSCLC
who have progressed on prior chemotherapy. Gefitinib
and erlotinib interfere with EGFR signal pathway and
showed response rates of 10% to 27% in phase 2 trials
conducted in a broad NSCLC patient population after
failure of chemotherapy.13,14 Two large randomized
phase 2 trials (Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung
Cancer, IDEAL 1 and 2) demonstrated that gefitinib was
efficacious and was well tolerated in patients with previously treated NSCLC.13-15 However, the Iressa Survival
Evaluation in Lung Cancer trial comparing gefitinib with
placebo in patients with advanced NSCLC who had failed
prior chemotherapy did not show any significant
improvement of survival with gefitinib in the overall population of predominantly refractory patients. However,
preplanned subgroup analyses in the Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer study demonstrated a significant
survival benefit in patients who were never smokers and
those of Asian origin. Therefore, gefitinib has been widely
used, especially in Asian populations, including in Korea.
Also, cumulative data with gefitinib demonstrated consistently high response rates of >25% in Asian patients.16
More recently, a large randomized phase 3 trial (Iressa
NSCLC Trial Evaluating Response and Survival vs Taxotere; INTEREST) comparing gefitinib with docetaxel as
standard second-line chemotherapy regimens in pretreated advanced NSCLC17 demonstrated that survival
with gefitinib was equivalent (noninferior) to docetaxel in
a broad unselected population.
The BR.21 trial demonstrated that erlotinib monotherapy was an effective treatment compared with placebo
for patients with advanced NSCLC that had relapsed or
recurred after prior chemotherapy who were not eligible
for further chemotherapy.12 On the basis of the results of
several large randomized clinical trials, the EGFR TK
inhibitors gefitinib and/or erlotinib can be considered
valid treatment options for pretreated patients with
advanced NSCLC, and are registered in many countries
for this indication.
Although both these agents have similar structures
and appear to show similar efficacy, a direct comparison

of gefitinib and erlotinib in terms of efficacy and other
clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC who have
failed prior chemotherapy has not yet been performed.
This prompted us to compare the clinical outcomes of
gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC in a retrospective case-control
review.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 467 NSCLC
patients who had been treated with gefitinib or erlotinib
at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between January 2006 and December 2008 after relapse or recurrence
of prior chemotherapy. This retrospective analysis was
approved by Samsung Medical Center’s institutional
review board. All patients had pathologically proven
advanced/metastatic or recurrent NSCLC and had failed
prior chemotherapy. Patients with stable or controlled
brain metastasis who underwent whole brain radiotherapy
or stereotactic radiosurgery were not excluded from this
review.
The gefitinib group was defined as patients who had
been treated with gefitinib after failure of prior therapies
but had never been treated with erlotinib. The erlotinib
group was defined as patients who had been treated with
erlotinib after failure of prior therapies but had never been
treated with gefitinib. Clinical parameters studied at the
time of EGFR TK inhibitor treatment were as follows:
age, sex, smoking history, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), histology, number of prior systemic chemotherapy regimens, stage, time
interval from diagnosis to EGFR TK inhibitor treatment,
and sites of metastasis. No patient received any concurrent
chemotherapy or other experimental agents during gefitinib or erlotinib treatment. Oral gefitinib was given daily
at a dose of 250 mg/d, and oral erlotinib at a dose of
150 mg/d. These EGFR TK inhibitors were continued
until disease progression, development of unacceptable
toxicity, or patient refusal. Response evaluation was
assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) guidelines.18 Response evaluation was performed every 6 or 8 weeks of chemotherapy
by chest computed tomography scan. In total, 210
patients were treated with gefitinib, and 257 patients were
treated with erlotinib during this period. Given the retrospective nature of this review, to minimize the heterogeneity between the 2 groups, pairs of patients from each
treatment group were matched according to 4 variables:
Cancer

sex (male vs female), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs
2), histologic type (adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma), and smoking history (never vs ever/current). On
the basis of these 4 variables, each matched pair of patients
had to be in the same category for sex, ECOG performance status, histologic type, and smoking history. When
>1 match was available in each group, pairs were randomly allocated to balance the number of each subgroup
in the gefitinib and erlotinib groups. Random number
tables were used for the selection process. These match criteria resulted in the selection of 171 pairs of patients.
Statistical Analysis
Treatment outcomes were estimated as response rate, disease control rate, overall survival (OS), and progression
free survival (PFS). In our institute, we set the clinical
practice guidelines for response evaluation for the EGFR
TK inhibitors. EGFR TK inhibitors were given daily, and
the cycle was repeated every 28 days. First evaluation was
usually performed 4 weeks after initial treatment, then after every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks). Tumor response was
determined according to RECIST 1.0. OS was defined as
the time elapsed from the date of EGFR TK inhibitor
treatment to the date of death. PFS was defined as the
time from the date of EGFR TK inhibitor treatment to
the date of disease progression or death from any cause.
The efficacy analysis was based on the intent to treat population. Response rate and disease control rates were compared between the gefitinib and erlotinib groups using
Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test.
Survival curves were constructed using the KaplanMeier method, and differences between curves were evaluated by the log-rank test.19 The Cox proportional hazard
regression model was used in univariate and multivariate
analysis to identify significant prognostic factors for survival in all patients treated with EGFR TK inhibitors. Differences were considered significant if P < .05.

RESULTS
A total of 171 patients who had been treated with gefitinib
were compared with the same number of patients treated
with erlotinib by a matched-pair case-control method.
The median age of 171 pairs of patients (N ¼ 342) was
58 years (range, 20-85 years), and the median ECOG performance status was 1 (range, 0-3). The baseline clinical
characteristics of all patients are shown in Table 1. Four
variables (sex, ECOG performance status, histologic type,
and smoking history) were matched. Baseline characterisCancer

tics were generally the same between the gefitinib and
erlotinib groups. The number of prior systemic chemotherapy (P ¼ .072) and lung to lung metastasis (P ¼ .070)
showed a nonsignificant difference between the gefitinib
and erlotinib groups. The most common site of metastasis
in both groups at the time of EGFR TK inhibitor treatment was lung, followed by bone, intra-abdomen, and
central nervous system. Of 342 patients, 21 had stage IIIb
disease with pleural or pericardial effusion. Of the 342,
294 (86%) received their EGFR TK inhibitors as secondline or third-line chemotherapy, whereas the remaining
14% had received >2 prior chemotherapy regimens
before receiving an EGFR TK inhibitor. There was no difference in other second-/third-line therapy such as pemetrexed or docetaxel between the gefitinib and erlotinib
groups (P ¼ .893). The overall response rates and disease
control rates in the gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated groups
were 38% versus 32.2% (P ¼ .273) and 63.2% versus
64.9%, respectively (P ¼ .677) (Table 2). The median OS
from first study treatment in the gefitinib group was 12.6
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9-15.3), and
that in the erlotinib group was 12.1 months (95% CI,
9.55-14.65) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.996; 95% CI, 0.7721.285; P ¼ .974) (Fig. 1, Top). The median PFS for the
gefitinib group was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.34-5.86),
compared with 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.93-3.47) for the
erlotinib group (HR, 0.806; 95% CI, 0.643-1.010;
P ¼ .061]) (Fig. 1, Bottom).
For each subgroup, survival was compared between
the gefitinib and erlotinib groups. There was no significant survival difference between the 2 treatments in any
subgroups defined by age ( 60 years, >60 years); sex
(male, female); ECOG PS (0-1, 2); histology (adenocarcinoma, nonadenocarcinoma); number of prior chemotherapy regimens (2, >2); smoking status (never,
current, or ever); stage (IIIb, IV); metastasis to central
nervous system, lung, intra-abdomen, and bone (present,
absent, respectively); the interval from diagnosis to the
TK inhibitor therapy (12 months, >12 months); and
skin rash (present, absent) (Table 3).
The overall response rate of all 342 patients was
35.1%, and the disease control rate was 64%. With 13.2
months of follow-up, the median OS for the total 342
patients was 12.4 months (95% CI, 10.66-14.14) and
the median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.65-3.75).

DISCUSSION
In this matched-pair case-control study, we demonstrated
that gefitinib and erlotinib appeared to have similar outcomes in patients with advanced/metastatic or recurrent
NSCLC who failed prior platinum-based chemotherapy.
The overall response rates and disease control rates in the
gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated groups were 38% versus
32.2% (P ¼ .273) and 52.8% versus 62.6%, respectively
(P ¼ .677). Furthermore, the median OS from first treatment in the gefitinib group was 12.6 months, and that in
the erlotinib group was 12.1 months, which is not a significant difference. For PFS, there was a favorable trend for
the gefitinib group compared with the erlotinib group
(4.6 months vs 2.7 months; P ¼ .06), although this did
not reach statistical significance. In our study, high
response rates of >30% in both arms and promising survival were observed. It has been reported that the pooled
cumulative analysis of clinical data of EGFR TK inhibitors from Asian countries has consistently shown that
EGFR TK inhibitors can achieve about 20% to 30% of
response rate.16 Recently, we reported that the incidence
of EGFR mutations for all patients who were treated with
erlotinib was higher (26.1%) in Korean patients when
compared with Western countries (<10%).17 This is consistent with previously reported data. Therefore, the high
response rate in this analysis might be explained because
of high EGFR-positive rate. However, in this retrospective study, only <10% of the patient population was
available for EGFR molecular study, which is not representative of the whole population. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we did not analyze the data.
The recently reported phase 3 studies, INTEREST
(IRESSA in NSCLC Trial Evaluating Response and
Survial vs Taxotere) and V-15-32 (comparing gefitinib
with docetaxel in pretreated advanced NSCLC) have

demonstrated equivalence or similar efficacy in terms of
overall survival.17,20 More recently, ISTANA (IRESSA as
Second-Line Therapy in Advanced NSCLC-Korea)
showed longer PFS and a significantly improved overall response rate compared with docetaxel in Korean
patients.21
It is unclear why no survival benefit with gefitinib
was found in the Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer study, despite apparent similar antitumor activity as
that seen in previous studies with erlotinib. Several possible explanations can be considered, such as suboptimum
dosing and enrollment of highly refractory cases. But it
can be argued that gefitinib concentrations in tumor tissue
are much higher than those in plasma.22 Also, in this
study, patients were treated with 250mg/d of gefitinib,
and there was no difference in response rate, PFS, or OS

3030

between the gefitinib and erlotinib groups. Interestingly,
we found that PFS was numerically longer for the gefitinib group than for the erlotinib group, despite the 2
groups being well balanced for various clinical characteristics. This might be attributable to a difference in an
unmeasured characteristic, such as EGFR activating
mutation status between the 2 groups. On the basis of the
I-PASS study results, molecular factor is among the most
important factors for predicting clinical outcomes. However, in this retrospective study, only <10% of the patient
population was available for EGFR molecular study,
which is not representative of the whole population.
Therefore, in this retrospective study, we did not analyze
the data. Given that there is no significant difference in
terms of other clinical characteristics between the gefitinib-treated group and the erlotinib-treated group, the 2

groups are well balanced regardless of other molecular
results. Regarding this matter, now we are conducting a
prospective study for ‘‘Comparison of Erlotinib Versus
Gefitinib as the Second-Line Therapy for the Treatment
of Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Patients.’’ In
this prospective study, molecular study (EGFR mutation)
will be evaluated along with other clinical outcomes. Until
now, about 50% of patients’ tissue has been available.
In this study, there were no significant differences in
OS between the 2 treatments in any subgroup defined by
age (60 years, >60 years); sex (male, female); ECOG PS
(0-1, 2); histology (adenocarcinoma, nonadenocarcinoma); number of prior chemotherapy regimens (2,
>2); smoking status (never, current, or ever); stage of disease (IIIb, IV); metastasis to the central nervous system,
lung, intra-abdomen, or bone (present, absent, respectively); or the interval from diagnosis to the start of EGFR
TK inhibitor therapy (12 months, > 12 months). We
also found that ECOG PS 0-1, adenocarcinoma histology, absence of intra-abdominal or bone metastasis, and a
time interval from diagnosis to the start of EGFR TK inhibitor 12 months were independent factors associated
with longer OS in a pooled analysis of all 342 patients.
This is consistent with previous reports.23-25
However, this retrospective study has several limitations. Although baseline characteristics were well balanced
between the 2 groups by a matched-pair method with 4
variables (sex, ECOG performance status, smoking, histology type) that are known to be associated with favorable
clinical outcome in EGFR TK inhibitor-treated patients,
the number of prior systemic chemotherapy regimens was
not equally balanced despite an absence of statistically significant differences. This factor could possibly account for
the shorter PFS observed in the erlotinib group. Also, the
review is retrospective and not randomized, and therefore
there may be imbalances between the treatments in other
unmeasured clinical factors. Finally, this study did not consider other important issues such as dose intensity, toxicity
profiles, treatment compliance, or quality of life.
In conclusion, this is the first matched-pair casecontrol study that evaluated and compared outcome
between gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients
with NSCLC who had failed prior chemotherapy. Our
analysis shows that gefitinib and erlotinib in pretreated
patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC appear to
have similar antitumor activity in terms of response rate
and OS. Further prospective studies are warranted to elucidate any differences in the efficacy, toxicity, dose intensity, and quality of life between gefitinib and erlotinib.
