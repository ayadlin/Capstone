BACKGROUND: Despite advancement in therapies, overall survival rates for relapsed pediatric sarcomas are dismal.
Newer therapies are needed to effectively salvage these patients. Oncolytic viruses (such as reovirus) and other genetically altered viruses (such as herpes simplex viruses and adenoviruses) have shown efficacy in a variety of solid
tumors including sarcomas. Reolysin is an unmodified oncolytic reovirus that selectively replicates in Ras-activated
cancer cells while not causing any significant human illness in its wild form. METHODS: By using a panel of pediatric
sarcoma cell lines in vitro and flank xenografts in vivo, Reolysin was evaluated as a single agent and in combination
with cisplatin and radiation therapy. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrated a cytopathic effect in treated tumors. RESULTS: Reolysin inhibited the proliferation and viability of sarcoma cell lines at a
dose of 1 to 10 virus particles per cell. In vivo, 5  109 plaque-forming units (PFU) administered via the tail vein every
other day for 3 doses every 21 days inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts with improvement in event-free survival.
In the SKES1 Ewing sarcoma line, there was therapeutic enhancement when reovirus was administered in combination
with radiation or cisplatin. In the RH30 line and the OS33 line, therapeutic enhancement was demonstrated with radiation and cisplatin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Reolysin alone or in combination with

other cytotoxic agents may be effective therapy in pediatric sarcomas. Cancer 2011;117:1764–74. V

Reovirus, or respiratory enteric orphan virus, was termed as such because it is not associated with a known disease
state. The Dearing strain of reovirus (serotype 3) is a naturally occurring, ubiquitous, nonenveloped, human virus with a
genome consisting of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA.1 Community-acquired reovirus infections are generally considered mild and are limited to the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. The cytopathic effect of reovirus is
restrained to cells transformed by an activated Ras signaling pathway.2-6 During naturally occurring infections in immunocompetent animals, the pathogenic effects appear to be minimal. The infectious cycle begins when the viral particles are
converted in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to intermediate subviral particles (ISVPs) because of the action of proteolytic
enzymes. The reovirus initially infects the epithelial cells of the ileum and is thought to then cross through the intestinal M
cells, moving to the Peyer’s patches, and then the mesenteric lymph nodes through lymphatic dissemination.3,4 The virus
may eventually transit in the blood stream to extraintestinal organs and the central nervous system.7 Although it can infect
many different organs, the reovirus produces very minor illness, if any. Seventy percent to 100% of adults will have antireovirus antibodies indicative of a prior exposure. The specific cytopathic effect of reovirus in Ras-transformed cells
coupled with the absence of significant symptoms associated with human infection, make reovirus an attractive anticancer
agent.
Reolysin is manufactured, clinical-grade, unmodified, Dearing strain reovirus capable of infecting and lysing a wide
range of human tumors.7-12 There are 16 completed or ongoing phase 1 or phase 2 studies of Reolysin in Canada, the

United Kingdom, and the United States. There are more
than 290 patients receiving single or multiple doses intratumorally or intravenously either as a monotherapy or in
combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is
interesting to note that phase 1 dose-escalation studies
using intravenous administration as monotherapy or
combined with chemotherapies, including gemcitabine,
docetaxel, and carboplatin/paclitaxel or combined with
radiotherapy, have been completed with no maximum
tolerated dose for Reolysin reached at doses up to
3  1010 TCID50. However, these results can be definitively addressed only in controlled trials.
Reovirus binds to ubiquitously expressed sialic acid
on mammalian cells and is internalized. In reovirus-resistant cells, viral protein transcripts phosphorylate and activate the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase
(PKR). The activated PKR subsequently phosphorylates
the a-subunit of the translation initiation factor (eIF-2),
which in turn inhibits viral gene translation. The phosphorylation of eIF-2 by PKR protects normal cells from
reovirus-mediated lysis. Viral transcripts are generated but
not translated in normal cells.13 However, cells transfected with v-erbB, sos, or ras, all of which activate Ras-signaling pathways, are readily lysed by reovirus.14,15 In cells
transformed by activated Ras, or by some other component of the Ras signaling pathway, PKR phosphorylation
is either inhibited or reversed. As a result, viral protein
synthesis ensues, and the proliferating viral particles ultimately lyse the host cell.13-15
Activated signaling through the Ras pathway is common in pediatric sarcomas. In this article, we demonstrate
that Reolysin inhibits tumor growth of a panel of human
sarcomas xenografts after systemic administration. Viral
particles are noted in tumor cells 24 hours and 48 hours
after systemic injection by electron microscopy. Combination therapy with either cisplatin or external beam radiation may provide additional benefit and do not appear to
limit the cytopathic effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
The tumor cell lines used included the RD and RH30
rhabdomyosarcoma lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va); the Saos-2 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va), and OS187 (generous gift

morial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NY, NY); and
HSSY-II and SYO-I synovial sarcoma lines (gift of Mark
Ladanyi, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). The
cells were grown in monolayer at 37 C, 5% CO2 in
media. Saos-2, OS187, SYO-1, and HSSY-II were grown
in Eagle minimum essential medium (MEM), SK-PNDW, RD, and SKES1 in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DME), and RH30 in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% glutamine (Invitrogen). The OS2 and OS33 xenograft lines (a gift of
Peter J. Houghton, St. Jude Children’s Research Center,
Memphis, TN) are tumor lines maintained by serial passage in mice as previously described.16
Drugs
Reolysin was provided by Oncolytic Biotech (Calgary,
Alberta, Canada). Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo) and resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Growth inhibition was determined by the microculture
tetrazolium method. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well,
flat-bottomed, microtiter plates at a density of 500 cells/
well in 100 lL of media. After overnight incubation, 100
lL of media containing Reolysin was added to achieve
specified final concentrations and a final volume of 200
lL/well. At 120 hours, the relative metabolic activities of
treated and untreated cells were measured by mitochondrial conversion of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazon-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma, St. Louis,
Mo) to formazine. At the completion of the drug treatment, 250 lg of MTT was added to each well and incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2 for 6 hours. Formazine crystals
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and optical density at
595 nm measured on a VERSAmax spectrophotometer
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif). Absorbance values
were normalized to the values obtained for the vehicletreated cells to determine the percentage of survival. The
IC50 was defined as the concentration at which absorbance of the treated cells was 50% that of the controls. All
experiments were performed in triplicate, and the data are
the mean of 2 separate experiments.
Murine Xenograft Models
Athymic nu/nu mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind) were implanted with subcutaneous flank

tumors. For cell lines RH30, RD, SKES1, SK-PN-DW,
HSSY-II, and SYO-1, cultured cells were harvested with
trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in 50% Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, Calif) at a concentration of 1  106
cells/0.1 mL. At 5 to 6 weeks of age, the mice were
injected with 0.1 mL of cells suspended in Matrigel. The
OS2 and OS33 tumor lines were established at St. Jude
Children’s Cancer Research Hospital and have been
described previously.16 For transplantation with OS2
and OS33 tumor, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane. A small incision was made in the flank of the mouse,
and a 4-mm by 4-mm section of tumor implanted
subcutaneously.
When the tumors were approximately 0.4 to 0.5 cm
in diameter, tumor-bearing mice were randomized into
groups of 8 mice with 1 treatment group and 1 control
group. Treated mice received Reolysin 5  109 plaqueforming units (PFU) in 100 lL phosphate-buffer saline
(PBS) or vehicle control every other day for 3 days starting
on Day 1 and Day 22 as a tail vein injection. Assuming a
spherical tumor, the volume was determined by the formula: mm3 ¼ p  (D)  d2/6, where D is the maximal diameter and d is the diameter perpendicular to D. Volumes
are expressed as relative tumor volumes (RTV), where the
tumor volume at any given time point is divided by the
starting tumor volume. The RTV for treated and control
mice were measured a minimum of once per week. All
experiments were conducted by using protocols and conditions approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Assessment of Tumor Response and
Statistical Considerations
By criteria defined previously by Houghton et al.,16 progressive disease is defined as <50% regression from original tumor volume for the entire study period (RTV >0.5)
and >25% increase in tumor volume at the end of the
study period (RTV >1.25). Stable disease is defined as tumor regression that does not exceed 50% of the original
tumor volume throughout the entire study period (RTV
>0.5) and <25% increase in tumor volume at the end of
the study period (RTV <1.25). A partial response
is defined as greater than 50% regression in tumor
volume (RTV <0.5) but with a measurable tumor mass
of greater than 0.10cm.3 Loss of measurable tumor mass
(<0.10cm3) at any point during the treatment period (6
weeks) was defined as a complete response (CR). A maintained CR was defined as a loss of measurable tumor mass

1766

(<0.10cm3) at any point after initiation of therapy without regrowth during the 6-week study period.
Statistical analysis was based on event-free survival
(EFS). An event is defined as a relative tumor volume of
4 (ie, quadruple the starting tumor size) or death. EFS is
defined as the time from the initiation of the study to an
event. For those tumors not reaching an event by 6 weeks,
the end of the study period, the time to event is defined as
Day 43. For tumors reaching an event before Day 22, the
RTV at Day 22 was calculated using the actual tumor volume at the time of the event. RTV values were compared
with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test with
Bonferroni correction. The survival analysis for each treatment was determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Pairwise comparisons of the Kaplan-Meier curves were
performed by a log-rank test with Bonferroni correction.
The difference was considered to be significant when the
P value was <.05. In combination testing, a treatment
minus control (T-C) value is calculated from the median
time to event for each group. The combination is considered to provide therapeutic enhancement when the T-C
value for the combination is greater that the T-C for both
single treatments evaluated and the EFS distributions for
the single treatments are significantly better (P<0.05).17
Electron Microscopy Scanning
Electron microscopy was performed by JEOL (Jeol Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan) 100CXII microscope on thin sections of
tumor at specified time points. Greater than 100 highpowered fields (54,000) for each tumor and vehicle controls were scanned for evidence of reovirus infection 24
and 48 hours after systemic administration of the virus.
Irradiation
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 45 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal) then placed into a poly(methyl
methacrylate) (Lucite) jig with 0.5 cm of lead body protection and individualized compartments through which
a circular port was accessible for localized flank irradiation
(20 Gy). A 40 MGC Philips (Best, Netherlands and Andover, Massachusetts) orthovoltage unit, operating at 320
kVp, 5 mA, and 0.5 mm copper filtration were used. All
dose calculations are based on thermoluminescence dosimetry at a midline phantom within the jig.
Detection of apoptosis
Terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was done on paraffinembedded tissue sections using the apoptosis detection kit

tumors from the control and the treated mice were harvested at the specified time points and fixed with formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
deparaffinized with xylene and serial washes of ethanol.
Endogenase peroxidase was quenched with 3% hydrogen
peroxide. The slides were incubated with TdT enzyme for
1 hour at 37 C. The reaction was stopped with the stop
buffer provided in the kit. Antidigoxigenin conjugate was
added for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were
then washed with PBS, and peroxidase substrate was
added for 5 minutes at room temperature. Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin and then mounted with
a coverslip. The number of brown-staining nuclei were
visually analyzed under light microscopy, magnification
400.

RESULTS
Reolysin Inhibited the Proliferation and
Viability of Pediatric Solid Tumor Cell Lines
In the each of the rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,
osteosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma lines, Reolysin
resulted in growth inhibition (Table 1). Cell viability in
all cell lines approached 0 after 120 hours of continuous
exposure to virus at a dose of 1 to 10 virus particles per cell
(PFU of 1 to 10).

significant antitumor activity in xenograft models when
compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 1). A partial
response was seen in mice bearing the RH30 and SKES1

EP: Experimental Period.

By Electron Microscopy (EM), Reovirus Is
Identified in Cells 24 and 48 Hours After
Systemic Administration
In the RH30 and OS33 lines, reovirus particles are visible
by electron microscopy 24 hours (Fig. 2a) and 48 hours
after systemic administration of Reolysin (Fig. 2b). These
data confirm infection of tumor cells after intravenous
administration of virus.
Reolysin Is Effective in Combination With
DNA Damaging Agents
Given the finding that reovirus requires functional cellular
transcription machinery to replicate, we evaluated the effect
of Reolysin in combination with a DNA-damaging agent,
cisplatin, and with radiation therapy. For these experiments,
we used a reduced dose of Reolysin of 1  109 PFU administered via tail vein injection on Days 1, 3, and 5 only. In the
SKES1 line (Fig. 3a), each Reolysin and cisplatin alone
yielded progressive disease, whereas a complete response
was seen with the combination. In the OS33 line, Reolysin
alone yielded stable disease, cisplatin progressive disease,
and the combination a partial response (Fig. 3b). Minimal
or no effect was seen when Reolysin was used in combination with cisplatin in the HSSY-II line (Fig. 3c). The combination met criteria for therapeutic enhancement in both
SKES1 and OS33 (Table 3).
Mice bearing RH30 rhabdomyosarcoma and
SKES1 Ewing sarcoma xenografts were treated with Reolysin at a dose of 1  109 PFU on Days 1, 3, and 5. Five
fractions of 4 Gy each were administered to the mice also
starting on Day 1 for 4 consecutive days (total dose is 20
Gy). Progressive disease was seen in both tumor lines for
Reolysin and radiation alone. However, in the RH30 xenograft, a complete response was seen after the combina-

1768

tion therapy and a partial response with the combination
in the SKES1 tumor (Fig. 4). The combination met criteria for therapeutic enhancement in both RH30 and
SKES1 (Table 4).
Increased Degree of Apoptosis Is Seen in
the Tumors Treated With the Combination
of Reolysin and Radiation
RH30 and SKES1 tumors treated with the combination
of Reolysin and radiation showed an increased number of
apoptotic nuclei in comparison to the controls and to the
individual treatment groups (Figs. 5a, 5b).

DISCUSSION
Viral oncolysis is defined as the killing of a cancer cell by
infection and replication of a virus inside the cell. Exciting
developments have been made in this field since its discovery in 1903. The major challenge in the development of
these therapies in patients was the high rate of infectious
complications resulting from the use of wild-type viruses.
With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it
became possible to create attenuated virus mutants that
were harmless to humans but still capable of infecting and
killing tumor cells. Since then, several such viral mutants
have been developed and are in clinical trials in cancer
patients. A few of these include: human herpes virus
(HSV1716), vaccinia virus (JX-594), Seneca Valley virus
(SVV-001), and adenovirus (ONYX 015).18-21 Reovirus
(Reolysin) is unique in the category of oncolytic viruses as
being the only virus used in its wild form in patients.
Normally in cells infected with reovirus, the doublestranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) is autophosphorylated in the presence of viral transcripts thus
inhibiting viral protein synthesis and replication. RasCancer

activated cells inhibit the autophosphorylation of PKR,
keeping it in an inactive state and allowing viral translation and eventual oncolysis to take place.6 The selective
oncolysis of cells with increased signaling through Ras and
the minimal effect on normal tissues makes Reolysin an
interesting candidate for oncolytic viral therapy. We demonstrated that Reolysin has activity after systemic administration in a panel of pediatric sarcomas implanted in
Athymic nu/nu mice and that this oncolytic effect is not
inhibited when combined with DNA-damaging therapies
(cisplatin and radiation). In fact, there is evidence of therapeutic enhancement of the combination in 3 of the 4 tumor lines evaluated.

Cancer

Ras may be activated through mutations in the Ras
proto-oncogene, upstream mitogenic signals such as tyrosine receptor kinases, or overexpression of growth-factor
receptors. Regardless of the mechanism, 70% of cancers
have activated Ras either by mutation or overexpression of
upstream or downstream signaling regulators. However, it
is not certain that Ras is the only intracellular signaling
pathway capable of inhibiting autophosphorylation of
PKR. For this reason, interrogation of the Ras pathway is
not a focus of this article. In translating these results into
the clinical setting, a valid biomarker for Reolysin activity
has yet to be defined. Ras mutations are rare in pediatric
malignancies, and down-stream proteins such as MAPK

help identify molecular determinants of Ras activity.
Previously, Reolysin was reported to have antitumor
activity in metastatic human colon and ovarian xenografts
in mice after systemic administration.9 In each of 7 sar-

cell (1-10 PFU). Given the exponential growth of the tumor cells in culture, this implies efficient infection and

oncolysis.
Enhanced in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic effects of
combination of Reolysin with radiation therapy22 and
Reolysin with chemotherapeutic agents23 has previously
been reported in a variety of adult cancer cell lines and
xenografts. It is easy to speculate that DNA-damaging
agents commonly used in treatment of malignancies may
alter viral replication and oncolysis. In the our study, the
use of DNA-damaging agents in combination with Reolysin did not adversely affect the oncolytic capacity of the
Reolysin. In 3 tumors lines treated with a single dose of

1772

cisplatin and 3 doses of Reolysin, there was therapeutic
enhancement in the SKES1 Ewing sarcoma line. In the
OS33 tumor line, there was a trend toward therapeutic
enhancement, but Reolysin alone induced tumor growth
delay beyond the 6-week experimental period. In the
HSSY-II synovial sarcoma line, there was no therapeutic
enhancement when Reolysin was combined with cisplatin. At a dose of 1  109 PFU for this combination study,
Reolysin had little effect on the HSSY-II xenograft, and
cisplatin provided no therapeutic enhancement. There
was therapeutic enhancement and an increase in apoptotic

phase 2 studies of Reolysin, in adult cancer patients
worldwide, it has been used both intralesionally and via
systemic administration, either alone or in combination
with other cytotoxic agents. Intralesional delivery of Reolysin was evaluated in 3 phase 1 trials of advanced cancers
in adults including prostate cancer and malignant gliomas.10 No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in these
patients. Major adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2
fever, myalgias, arthralgias, headaches, seizures (in
patients with malignant gliomas), and elevation of alanine
transaminase. Two recent phase 1 trials of systemic
administration of Reolysin in adults with advanced cancers did not show any dose limiting toxicities. The major
adverse events associated with Reolysin were, again, mild
to moderate flu-like symptoms (such as fever, chills, headache, fatigue, rhinorrhea, and cough) as well as GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Moderate and transient alterations in hepatic function
tests and hematology values were also observed.24,25 A
phase 2 study of intravenous Reolysin in adult patients
with bone sarcomas metastatic to the lungs showed that
14 (42%) patients had stable disease for more than 2
months, 5 of whom had stable disease for more than 6
months.26 These results met the statistical endpoint for
the trial of 3 or more patients having prolonged stabilization of disease for more than 6 months. However, these
clinical data are less impressive than what would have
been expected from the preclinical results. One of the reasons for this observation may be the finding that most
humans have neutralizing antibodies against reovirus
from past infections that might hinder the effect of reovirus by enhanced clearance of the virus by the host immune
system. Although pre-existing antibodies have been
reported not to interfere with the antitumor activity of
reovirus in immunocompetent C3H mice when administered intratumorally,13 a recent report shows that systemic
administration of reovirus in immunized mice was ineffective in inhibiting tumor growth.7 Combination of reovirus with immunosuppressive therapy in these mice
completely restored the ability of the virus to inhibit tumor growth. Similarly, combination of reovirus with
drugs such as cyclophosphamide is also shown to enhance
antitumor activity likely because of suppression of the
host immune system and decrease in neutralizing viral
antibodies.27 Thus, this approach of immune suppression

in combination with reoviral therapy may lead to better
inhibition of tumor growth in patients and is currently
being evaluated in adult and pediatric phase 1/2 trials. In
addition, a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, phase
3 study (REO 018) is being initiated in North America
and Europe.
In summary, in this article, we have demonstrated
that Reolysin is able to infect and lyse pediatric sarcoma
cells in vitro and to inhibit growth of sarcoma xenografts.
These data suggest that Reolysin may be a promising target therapy in pediatric cancers and should be further evaluated in clinical trials. A phase 1 trial in pediatric patients
with advanced malignancies is currently being planned.
