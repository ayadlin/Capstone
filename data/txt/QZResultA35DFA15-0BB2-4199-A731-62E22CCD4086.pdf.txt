ABSTRACT
Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found in red wine, has wide spectrum of
pharmacological properties including antioxidative and antiaging activities. Beta
amyloid peptides (Aβ) are known to involve cognitive impairment, neuroinflammatory
and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Activation of cAMP and/or cGMP
activities can improve memory performance and decrease the neuroinflammation
and apoptosis. However, it remains unknown whether the memory enhancing effect
of resveratrol on AD associated cognitive disorders is related to the inhibition of
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) subtypes and subsequent increases in intracellular cAMP
and/or cGMP activities. This study investigated the effect of resveratrol on Aβ1-42induced cognitive impairment and the participation of PDE4 subtypes related cAMP or
cGMP signaling. Mice microinfused with Aβ1-42 into bilateral CA1 subregions displayed
learning and memory impairment, as evidenced by reduced memory acquisition and
retrieval in the water maze and retention in the passive avoidance tasks; it was
also significant that neuroinflammatory and pro-apoptotic factors were increased
in Aβ1-42-treated mice. Aβ1-42-treated mice also increased in PDE4A, 4B and 4D
expression, and decreased in PKA level. However, PKA inhibitor H89, but not PKG
inhibitor KT5823, prevented resveratrol’s effects on these parameters. Resveratrol
also reversed Aβ1-42-induced decreases in phosphorylated cAMP response-element
binding protein (pCREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic
factor BCl-2 expression, which were reversed by H89. These findings suggest that
resveratrol reversing Aβ-induced learning and memory disorder may involve the
regulation of neuronal inflammation and apoptosis via PDE4 subtypes related cAMPCREB-BDNF signaling.

INTRODUCTION

anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, and
finally results in the memory enhancing effects.

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by accumulation of beta amyloid
peptides (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in
the brain, widespread cortical neuronal loss and the
progressive memory impairment [1]. The accumulation of
Aβ, particularly Aβ 1-40 (Aβ 40) and Aβ1-42 (Aβ 42),
and their deposition in insoluble plaques are the major
neuropathological hallmarks of AD. It is suggested that
the form of Aβ 42 is more neurotoxic than that of Aβ 40
[2]. Injection of plaques of Aβ 42 isolated from AD brains
into different brain regions of rats including hippocampus
and cortex results in neurodegenerative response, such
as neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis [3]. Although
the contradictory results argue the role of Aβ in the onset
of AD [4], inhibition of cerebral Aβ 42 seems necessary
and sufficient for preventing memory impairment in the
early stage of AD. However, the specific mechanisms
causing AD and memory deficits remain arguing due to
lack of scientifically proven pharmacological strategies.
Therefore, it is urgent to identify new targets and develop
novel anti-aging agents against AD.
Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol extracted from
grapes in the processing of red wine. It has been found
to exert numerous pharmacological properties including
antioxidative, antiinflammatory and antiaging activities.
Recent studies suggested resveratrol could protect
hippocampal neurons against Aβ 40 and oxidative stressinduced neurotoxicity and cell death [5, 6], suggesting its
potential role in treatment of aging-related learning and
memory deficits. Importantly, some studies suggested that
resveratrol increases cAMP production in breast cancer
cells [7]; cAMP levels were also found to increase in
skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue after treatment
with low doses of resveratrol [8]. Since intracellular cAMP
levels are usually controlled by phosphodiesterase (PDE)
activities, the further study found that resveratrol is a PDE
inhibitor. Recently, the role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE
4) inhibitors in learning and memory performance has
provoked intense interest in discovery of small-molecular
components from natural polyphenols that could delay or
halt Aβ-related cognitive disorders by inhibition of PDE4.
It keeps mysterious whether the increased cAMP levels
by treatment with resveratrol are related to inhibition of
PDE4 and its subtypes in the hippocampus, and whether
this inhibition of PDE4 dependent pathway contributes
to the subsequent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective
effects, as well as the cognitive enhancement in behavior.
The present study attempted to find the memory
enhancing effect of resveratrol on cognitive impairment
induced by Aβ 42, and to elucidate the biological pathway
by which it inhibits PDE4 subtypes and stimulates cAMPrelated neuroprotective effects. We found that resveratrol
inhibits cAMP-specific PDE4A, 4B and 4D, and the
related signaling in the hippocampus that mediates the

RESULTS
Resveratrol reversed Aβ-induced memory
impairment in the Morris water maze task
To determine whether resveratrol reversed memory
impairment caused by Aβ 42, we examined memory
performance in the Morris water maze test in mice treated
with Aβ 42 in the presence or absence of resveratrol. Aβ42
(0.4 μg/side) was infused into bilateral CA1 subregion
of the hippocampus. Although all mice reliably learned
to locate the platform throughout 6 blocks of acquisition
training, the groups significantly differed in their latency to
reach the platform during the 6 training blocks. The results
showed that vehicle-treated Aβ group mice took longer
to reach the platform in block 6 compared with vehicletreated sham group mice (p < 0.01), these were reversed
by resveratrol at 40 mg/kg (RES40) for 21 days, the
latencies to reach the platform for RES40-treated Aβ mice
were significantly shorter than that of the vehicle-treated
Aβ group in the 6th block (p < 0.05; Figure 1A). While
these effects of resveratrol (40 mg/kg) on acquisition were
blocked by pretreatment with PKA inhibitor H89 (p <
0.01; Figure 1B). However, the PKG inhibitor KT5823 did
not reverse the effect of resveratrol. H89 and KT5823 did
not have effects on Aβ-induced impairment of acquisition
when they were treated alone (data not shown).
One hour after the training, spatial memory was
assessed in the probe trial test, during which the platform
was removed. Vehicle-treated Aβ group mice showed
significantly longer latencies to reach the platform, made
fewer crossings over the platform, and altered duration in
the target quadrant compared with vehicle-treated sham
group (p < 0.001; p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively).
RES40-treated Aβ mice took significantly less time
to reach the platform, made more crossings over the
platform, and more exploration time in the target quadrant
than vehicle-treated Aβ group (F(3,36) = 3.36), p < 0.001;
F(3,36) = 3.993), p < 0.05; F(3,36) = 2.863), p < 0.01;
respectively). These could be reversed by pretreatment
with H89, but not KT5823 (Figure 2A-2C).
Memory retention for the platform location on
the probe trial was tested 24 h after the training section.
Similar to that of in the 1 h probe trail test, longer latencies,
fewer crossings and exploration time in the target quadrant
were detected in the vehicle-treated Aβ group (p < 0.001, p
< 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). RES40 ameliorated the
detrimental effects of Aβ on platform latency, crossings
and the time in the target quadrant [F(3,36) = 7.554, p
< 0.01; F(3.36) = 5.638, p < 0.01; F(3,36) = 4.031, p <
0.01]. However, resveratrol’s effects were blocked by

for memory performance using the step-down passive
avoidance task. As shown in Figure 4A, in the retention
test performed 3 h after training, Aβ42 induced significant
memory impairment, as evidenced by a lower retention
when compared with sham group (p < 0.01). RES40
administered for 21 days exhibited significantly higher
retention (F(3,36) = 4.840, p < 0.05), which was blocked
by pretreatment with H89 (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, retention
latency tested 24 h after initial training indicated that Aβ142-treated mice exhibited a decrease in retention relative
to sham group (p < 0.01). This effect was reversed by
resveratrol at 40 mg/kg (p < 0.01). However, H89 blocked
the effect of RES40 significantly (p < 0.05), whereas

decreased the IL-1β and IL-6 levels, which were prevented
by pretreatment with H89 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) (Figure
5A and 5B). In addition, we examined expression of Bax
and Bcl-2, both were cell death associated proteins, to
determine whether apoptotic responses were involved in
the effects of resveratrol on Aβ42-induced toxicity. As
shown in Figure 5C and 5D, expression of Bcl-2 and Bax
were changed after Aβ42 treatment, i.e. Aβ42 decreased
Bcl-2 expression (p < 0.001) and increased Bax levels (p
< 0.01) in the hippocampus. These effects were reversed
by treatment with resveratrol at dose of 40 mg/kg (p <
0.01 in Bcl-2; p < 0.05 in Bax). H89 blocked the effects of
resveratrol on Bcl-2 and Bax levels when compared with
RES40-treated Aβ group (p < 0.01 in Bcl-2; p < 0.001 in
Bax).

KT5823 did not affect the effect of RES40 (Figure 4B).

in the hippocampus, we examined expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6. The IL1β and IL-6 levels in the vehicle-treated Aβ group were
significantly increased when compared with that of the
vehicle-treated sham group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05).
These increases in IL-1β and IL-6 levels were significantly

Effects of resveratrol on cAMP protein kinase
(PKA) and PDE4 subtypes levels in the
hippocampus

The effects of resveratrol on Aβ1-42-induced
decreases in pCREB/CREB and BDNF expression
It has been suggested that the cAMP/PKA pathway
contributes to the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) and
is responsible for late phases of the memory consolidation
processes. We examined expression of pCREB and CREB
to verify whether the cAMP/PKA-CREB pathway was
involved in the effects of resveratrol on memory. The
amount of CREB phosphorylation between the vehicletreated Aβ42 group and sham group was found to be
significantly different, i.e., Aβ42 decreased pCREB
expression (p < 0.01). This decrease in the pCREB was
reversed by treatment with resveratrol at doses of 20 and
40 mg/kg for 21 d (F(3,12) = 20.65, p < 0.01 for 20 mg/kg;
p < 0.001 for 40 mg/kg). H89 blocked the effect of RES40
on pCREB expression (p < 0.01) (Figure 7A).
To determine whether resveratrol’s effect on
memory performance is related to neuroprotective effect.
We investigated BDNF expression in the hippocampus
in the presence of resveratrol in Aβ42-treated mice. As
shown in Figure 7B, BDNF levels were decreased in
the hippocampus of vehicle-treated Aβ42 group when

To determine whether microinfusion of Aβ42 into
hippocampus affected PKA and cAMP-related PDE4
expression, we determined the expression of PKA and
PDE4 subtypes in the hippocampus. Specific polyclonal
PDE4A5, 4B1 and 4D3 antibodies revealed that the major
protein bands of molecular masses 109 (for PDE4A5),
107 (for PDE4B1) and 95 kDa (for PDE4D3) in the
hippocampus, respectively (Figure 6A, 6B and 6C). The
significant increases in PDE4A5, 4B1 and 4D3 expression
induced by Aβ42 were found in the hippocampus; while
PKA was decreased in the Aβ42-treated mice (p < 0.01;
p < 0.001; p < 0.01; p < 0.001). Resveratrol at 40 mg/
kg reversed the increased expression of PDE4A5 and 4B1
(F(3,12) = 4.779, p < 0.05; F(3,12) = 5.386, p < 0.05);
while resveratrol at 20 and 40 mg/kg reversed the changes
of PDE4D3 and PKA levels induced by Aβ42 (F(3,12) =
7.713, p < 0.05, p < 0.01; F(3,12) = 6.176, p < 0.05; p <

which was reversed by 20 and 40 mg/kg resveratrol
treatment (F(3,12) = 13.370, p < 0.01 for 20 mg/kg; p <

learning and memory impairment in the Morris water
maze and step-down passive avoidance tests; resveratrol
also prevented memory extinction in the presence of Aβ42
in the passive avoidance test. Pretreatment with PKA
inhibitor H89, but not PKG inhibitor KT5823, prevented
these memory-enhancing effects. Further molecular
biological assays suggested that resveratrol inhibited
PDE4A5, 4B1 and 4D3 expression, and subsequently
increased cAMP levels. Moreover, high doses of
resveratrol decreased Aβ42-induced cytokines (IL-1β and
IL-6) and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) expression, which
were blocked by pretreatment with H89. The decreased
expression of anti-apoptotic protein (BCl-2), transcription
factor (pCREB/CREB) and BDNF levels produced by
Aβ42 were significantly reversed by resveratrol. These
effects were also blocked by pretreatment with H89.
The results suggest that PDE4 subtypes related cAMP
signaling might participate resveratrol’s protective effects
against Aβ42-induced neurotoxicity.
Aβ plays an important role in mediating the
pathogenesis of AD. Aβ deposition in the brain regions
that involves learning and memory performance, such
as frontal cortex and hippocampus, has been considered

DISCUSSION
Natural products provide adequate plant sources of
new therapeutic phytochemicals for treating aging related
disorders, such as AD. Resveratrol and its derivatives are
rich in grapes and have multiple therapeutically benefits
in the treatment of diseases associated with AD [9].
The neuroprotective effect of resveratrol has recently
been reported in a cell model of amyloid beta peptideinduced neurotoxic injury [9]. Although the in vivo
study suggested that a combination of resveratrol and a
lipid-core nanocapsule-based delivery system prevents
Aβ42-induced neurodegenerative process by modulation
of neuroinflammation [10], the specific mechanism
by which resveratrol exerts anti-aging effects remains
elusive. The present study demonstrated that 20 and 40
mg/kg resveratrol (via gavage) ameliorated Aβ42-induced

as an early event in the process of AD [11]. There are
two main forms of Aβ, Aβ 40 is the more soluble form,
while Aβ42 is the primary component of senile plaques
although it is found to have less than 5% in AD cases
[1]. Aβ42 has been shown to generate NFTs and tau
protein hyperphosphorylation in neuronal cultures,
which accelerate cognitive deficits in animals [12-14].
Microinjection of Aβ42 into the hippocampus of mice
has been recognized as a reliable and stable animal model
of AD, which mimics alterations known for AD patients

including memory deficits and downregulation of cAMP
signaling [11, 15].
Our present study provided promising demonstration
for memory impairment induced by microinfusion of
Aβ42 into bilateral CA1 of hippocampus, as evidenced
by prolonged escape latency in the acquisition trials
and decreased exploration in the target quadrant in the
water maze task, and decreased memory retention in
the passive avoidance test. Resveratrol at higher dose
(40 mg/kg) could reverse this learning and memory

impairment induced by Aβ42. Interestingly, this effect was
blocked by pretreatment with PKA inhibitor H89, while
PKG inhibitor did not affect this resveratrol’s memoryenhancing effect. This finding was further supported
by the subsequent neuronal biological assays, which
suggested that resveratrol could reverse inflammatory and
apoptotic cytokines expression in the presence of Aβ42.
These effects were also blocked by pretreatment with H89.
Studies have revealed the important roles of inflammatory
damage and apoptosis in the development or progression
of cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative disorders, such
as AD [16, 17]. Previous studies suggested that naturaloccurring polyphenol curcumin inhibits aging-related
pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, such as TNF-α
and IL-1β, and increases the index of anti-apoptotic and
pro-apoptotic factors, by increases in cAMP levels [2, 18].
Recent evidence demonstrated resveratrol and curcumin
exert the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects on agingrelated diabetes by inhibiting PDEs [19]. Another group of
study supports this finding that suggests PDE4 might be the
potential target for treating metabolic diseases associated
with aging [20]. The present study extends these previous
findings that suggested resveratrol at 40 mg/kg decreased
Aβ42-induced IL-1β and IL-6 increasing; while these
effects were reversed by pre-treatment with H89. Previous
studies suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines
exacerbate apoptotic progress [21, 22]. Inhibition of Il1β and IL-6 not only prevents inflammatory response but
also delays neuronal cell apoptosis [22]. It is interesting
to know whether resveratrol produces the anti-apoptotic
effect in Aβ42-treated mice. Several proteins are related
to the progress of apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, Bax, caspase
family members, p53 and p21 [23, 24]. Among them, the
Bcl-2 family members are the most intriguing proteins in
the regulation of apoptotic process. They can be divided
into anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and
Bcl-w, and pro-apoptotic members, such as Bax and
Bak [11, 25]. It has been suggested that microinjection
of Aβ into brain decreases in Bcl-2 and increases in Bax
expression that result in neuronal cell death in mice [26].
Our study suggested that resveratrol, at the same doses
that prevented Aβ42-induced learning and memory
impairment and reversed pro-inflammatory cytokines, also
reversed apoptotic response, as evidenced by increase in
Bcl-2 level and decrease in Bax expression in the Aβ42treated mice. However, these anti-neuroinflammatory
and anti-apoptotic effects of resveratrol were blocked by
pretreatment with H89, further supporting the participation
of cAMP-dependent protein kinases in regulation of Aβinduced inflammation and apoptosis.
The previous studies suggested that dietary intake
of resveratrol derivatives have a positive impact on Aβ42related brain aging [27, 28], and ameliorate aging-related
metabolic phenotypes, such as obesity and diabetes, by
inhibiting cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases, which
results in increases in cAMP levels [8, 19]. Unfortunately,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

there were few reports about the relationship between
PDE4 subtypes and resveratrol’s effects on aging-related
disorders, particularly learning and memory deficits.
Indeed, the intracellular cAMP levels are determined
by either the activities of ACs that synthesize cAMP
from ATP, or PDEs that regulate the hydrolysis of
cAMP and/or cGMP to AMP and/or GMP, respectively.
The present study suggested that cAMP levels were
significantly increased with a dose of 40 mg/kg resveratrol
administered in Aβ42-treated mice; further study showed
that resveratrol reversed Aβ42-induced increase in
PDE4A5, 4B1 and 4D3 expression. It is known that there
are four different genes encoded PDE4 (PDE4A- 4D),
each of which generates multiple splice variants [29].
However, only three of them, PDE4A, 4B and 4D, are
involved in learning and memory performance, PDE4C is
only found to express in the peripheral system [30]. More
specifically, PDE4A and PDE4D may be the major PDE4
subtypes in mediating memory. Comparably, PDE4B may
not be important in hippocampal-dependent memory.
This appears to be supported by the negative results in the
water-maze memory test using mice deficient in PDE4B
[31, 32]. Aβ deposition in frontal cortex and hippocampus
involves learning and memory performance has been
considered as an early event in the process of AD [11]. The
present results revealed that the expression of PDE4A5,
4B1 and 4D3 were increased in Aβ 42-treated mice in
the hippocampus, which were in agreement with our
preliminary data and the previous studies [33, 34]. Indeed,
these PDE4 splice variants are closely related to emotion
and the learning and memory performance evidenced by
previous studies [33, 35]. The present study also suggested
that the increased expression of PDE4A5, 4B1 and 4D3
was reversed by pretreatment with resveratrol for 21 days.
Considering that PKA inhibitor H89 blocked resveratrol’s
effects on memory performance in Aβ 42-treated mice, the
present findings give raise the possibility that resveratrol
activates cAMP-related signaling by inhibiting PDE4
subtypes, particularly PDE4A, 4B and 4D.
The increase of hippocampal Bcl-2 after treatment
with resveratrol in the present study may be explained
by the triggering of a neuroprotective pathway that aims
to promote neuroregeneration. Indeed, neurons in the
hippocampus of aged animals respond to Aβ-induced
toxicity by showing atrophy and a down-regulation of
BDNF and pCREB expression that are associated with
learning and memory impairment [36]. Results from our
study suggested that Aβ-induced decreased expression
in BDNF and pCREB in the hippocampus of mice. The
potential mechanisms for resveratrol’s neuroprotective
effects might be related to cAMP-signaling, as evidenced
by the fact that PKA inhibitor H89 prevented resveratrol’s
effects on BDNF and pCREB expression. Recent
studies have turned the attention to the neuroprotectiveneurorescue therapies for AD treatment, which indicate the
anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective effects of resveratrol

Taking together, the present study investigated
the effects of resveratrol on Aβ42 induced learning and

MATERIALS AND METHODS

tested for memory using Morris water maze and passive
avoidance tasks: (a) saline+vehicle; (b) Aβ42+vehicle; (c)
Aβ42+resveratrol (10, 20, 40 mg/kg); (d) Aβ42+H89; (e)
Aβ42+H89+resveratrol (40 mg/kg); (f) Aβ42+KT5823;
(g) Aβ42+KT5823+resveratrol (40 mg/kg). Fourteen
days after microinfusion of Aβ42, mice were treated with
different doses of resveratrol or vehicle, once per day for
3 weeks before Morris water maze and passive avoidance
tests were performed. The behavioral tests were subjected
30 min after the last drug treatment.

Behavioral test procedures

Animals
Male ICR mice weighing between 22 and 25 g
(2-3-month-old) were obtained from Animal Center of
Shanghai Branch, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Upon
arrival, mice were housed five per cage under standard
colony conditions, with controlled ambient temperature
(22±1 °C), humidity (50±10 %) and a natural light/
dark cycle (12:12h, lights on 7:00 AM). All experiments
were carried out according to the National Institutes of
Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Experimental procedures were approved by the Wenzhou
Medical University Committee on Animal Care and Use.

Morris water maze test
This was performed as described previously [32,
39] with slight modifications. The apparatus consisted of
a circular pool (95 cm diameter, 25 cm height) filled with
water, which was opaque by mixing with milk powder,
and a platform, which was either visible or immersed 1cm
under the surface of the water in one of the four identical
quadrants. The mice were taken for the prior habituation
to the pool one day before the test. The acquisition trials
(training to escape to the hidden platform) were carried
out for six blocks consisting of three (60 s) trials separated
by 20 min inter-block intervals during which the platform
remained in the same location relative to the distal cues
in the room. On each trial, mice were placed in the pool
each day from different starting points (E, S, W and N).
If mice failed to find the platform within 60 s, mice were
guided to the platform manually. One hour after the last
acquisition trial, the probe trial test was conducted with
the platform removed. Swimming behaviors, including
escape latency (time spent in locating the platform),
entries in target quadrant, duration in target quadrant,
swim distance, and swimming speed were monitored using
a computer controlled video-tracking system (CG-400
Image Acquisition System, Institute of Materia Medica,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, China).
Another probe trial was run 24 h after training to assess
consolidation and retrieval of memory [40].

Surgery
The surgical procedure was performed aseptically
under chloral hydrate anesthesia. Mice were placed in a
stereotaxic apparatus. Two holes are drilled on the skull
based on the coordinates for hippocampal CA1 (AP -1.7
mm from bregma, ML ±0.8 mm from midline, DV -2.0
mm from dura) before a guide cannula (30-gauge) was
inserted in each hole and fixed in place. After surgery,
the mice were allowed to recover for 3 days. Mice were
given bilateral microinjections of 2 µl Aβ42 (0.4 µg in
1 µl/side, rPeptide, USA), corresponding volumes was
infused bilaterally at the rate of 0.25 µl/min using a
syringe pump. The doses of Aβ42 based on the previous
research [16].The mice in sham group were given bilateral
microinjections of 2 µl artificial cerebrospinal fluid.

Drugs and treatments
Aβ42 (rPeptide, USA) was dissolved in 0.9% sterile
saline, at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The Aβ42
solution was incubated at 37 °C for 4 days to obtain
aggregated Aβbefore use [37, 38]. Resveratrol (SigmaAldrich) was prepared daily by dissolving in 0.9% sterile
saline. The mice received different doses of resveratrol

It was carried out in mice using a chamber
containing a wooden platform on one side of the grid floor
[41], electric shocks were delivered to the grid using an
isolated pulse stimulator. During the training, mice were
individually placed on the platform and subjected to a foot
shock (0.4-0.8 mA, 40 V, 0.5 s, 50 Hz, 20 sec intertrial
interval) when they completely descended to the grid floor.
This procedure was repeated immediately and again 1 h
after the initial training. Mice that stayed on the platform
for over 60 s were considered to have learned the task and
were removed to their home cages, without being given
further shocks. Retention tests were carried out 3 h and
then 24 h after the last training session. For all retention
tests, each mouse was placed on the platform and the stepdown latency was recorded, with an upper cut-off time of
300 s.

Mice were decapitated after passive avoidance test,
the hippocampus were dissected and stored at -80 °C until
analysis. The hippocampal tissues were homogenized in
RIPA lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at
4 ºC. Samples were separatedusing SDS-PAGE before
transferring to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were
blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h, and incubated with the
appropriate primary antibodies over night at 4 ºC (antiPKA protein kinase catalytic subunit 1:1000; anti-PDE4A5
1:1000; anti-PDE4B1 1:1000; anti-PDE4D3 1:1000; antiIL-1β, 1:1000; anti-IL-6, 1:1000; anti-Bcl-2, 1:1000;

Then the membranes wereincubated with the secondary
antibodies (anti-mouse lgG or anti-rabbit lgG) for 60
min at room temperature. After rinsing with buffer, the
immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence
using the ECL kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The film signals were digitally scanned and
then for sequent analysis with software.
