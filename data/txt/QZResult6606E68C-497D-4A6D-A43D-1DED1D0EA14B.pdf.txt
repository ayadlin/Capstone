BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin with everolimus may improve the efficacy of taxanes.
Everolimus and docetaxel are both metabolized by CYP3A4, which could result in a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with docetaxel (doses of 40-75 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle) in combination with everolimus (doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg orally on days
1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) in a phase 1 trial using the continuous reassessment method to determine maximum tolerated dose. The first 2 patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenic infection), prompting a mandatory
dose reduction and PK evaluation of both everolimus and docetaxel for patients enrolled in subsequent dosing
cohorts. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity included grade 3 mucositis (n ¼ 1), prolonged
grade 4 neutropenia (n ¼ 1), and grade 3 infection/febrile neutropenia (n ¼ 3). Day 8 of everolimus was commonly
held for neutropenia despite a dose reduction in docetaxel to 40 mg/m2. Eleven patients underwent complete PK
evaluation for everolimus, and 9 patients underwent complete PK evaluation for both everolimus and docetaxel.
Widely variable changes in clearance were seen for both drugs, and the study was terminated because of lack of efficacy and concerns regarding toxicity seen with the combination. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly everolimus in combination
with docetaxel every 3 weeks was associated with excessive neutropenia and variable clearance of both drugs,

INTRODUCTION
Taxanes affect the formation of microtubules, protein polymers essential for maintenance of cytoskeleton organization and mitotic spindle formation. Taxanes have demonstrated activity in a variety of cancer types and are currently
approved for the treatment of localized and advanced breast cancer. Docetaxel has been compared with doxorubicin and
was found to significantly improve response rate (47.8% vs 33.3%; P ¼ .008) in chemotherapy naive patients with
advanced breast cancer.1 Although not statistically significant, there was a trend in favor of docetaxel for improvement in
time to progression, although no improvement was seen in overall survival (OS). Docetaxel has also demonstrated
response rates of 30% to 42% and time-to-treatment failure of 4.2 to 6.5 months in patients with advanced breast cancer
previously treated with anthracyclines.2-6 Docetaxel has also been compared with paclitaxel given on a triweekly schedule
and demonstrated significantly superior time to progression (5.7 vs 3.6 months, P < .001) and OS (15.4 vs 12.7 months,
P ¼ 0.03).3
Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway is intricately involved in cancer cell
growth and survival.7 The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream effector protein that is activated by Akt and has been implicated in cancer cell resistance to drugs that inhibit microtubule function,

such as taxanes.8,9 In preclinical models, taxane therapy
induced the activation of mTOR, and pretreatment with
mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin or everolimus,
increased taxane-induced cell death.8,10
Everolimus is a novel macrolide that inhibits
mTOR by binding with high affinity to its intracellular
receptor FKBP12. The resulting complex binds to
mTOR, which prevents downstream signaling.11 Everolimus has been developed as both an immunosuppressant
for the treatment of transplant organ rejection and as an
anticancer agent. A phase 1 study in solid tumors demonstrated dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of mucositis and fatigue when everolimus was administered as a single agent
using a weekly schedule. The drug’s terminal half-life was
30 hours (range, 26-38 hours), and the area under the
curve increased proportional to the dose.11
Everolimus and docetaxel are both extensively
metabolized by the cytochrome CYP3A4 isoenzyme.12,13
Docetaxel is metabolized into a primary metabolite, M2,
through oxidation of the tert-butyl ester side group by
CYP3A4.13 The metabolites of docetaxel are exceedingly
less active than the parent compound; thus, given the
drug’s narrow therapeutic window, variations in the activity of CYP3A4 could result in substantial differences in
toxicity if given in combination with inhibitors of
CYP3A4. Based upon these data, we performed a phase 1
study of everolimus in combination with docetaxel for the
treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. The
purpose was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of
the combination, determine the DLTs, and identify antitumor activity.

significantly alter the absorption of everolimus, prior treatment with mitomycin C or nitrosoureas, surgery within 2
weeks before study entry, and concomitant therapy with
strong inhibitors or inducers of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Evaluation of DLT
Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0. DLT was defined
as any grade 4 nonhematological toxicity, grade 3 nonhematological toxicity unresponsive to supportive care
measures, grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days, febrile
neutropenia, or grade 2 neutropenia (ANC, <1.5 
109/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelets, <75  109/L)
that failed to revert to grade 1 (level at which treatment
is permitted) by the time of the scheduled start of cycle 2.
DLT also had to occur during the first cycle of therapy
and be considered drug related by the treating physician.
Dose-finding in this trial was conducted using a
continuous reassessment model. This approach models
the dose-toxicity relation using a 1-parameter curve. A
prior distribution is placed on the parameter before the
trial. After each set of patients is treated and toxicity is
observed, the distribution of the parameter is updated and
the next dose level is selected based on the predicted
toxicity.14

Patient Selection
Patients were 18 years of age, with metastatic breast cancer refractory to standard therapy, with adequate bone
marrow (absolute neutrophil count [ANC], 1.5  109/
L; platelets, 100  109/L; hemoglobin, 10g/dL), renal
function (creatinine, 1.5  upper limits of normal
[ULN]), and hepatic function (bilirubin, ULN; alkaline
phosphatase, 5  ULN; if alkaline phosphatase was
2.5  ULN, alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate
aminotransferase[AST] must have been 2.0  ULN; if
alkaline phosphatase was >2.5 but 5  ULN, ALT/
AST must have been 1.5  ULN), and performance status 0 to 2 using the World Health Organization scale.
Exclusion criteria included: thromboembolism within the
prior 6 months or active thrombophlebitis, grade >2

Drug Dosages and Schedules
Patients received dexamethasone 8 mg by mouth twice
daily for 3 days beginning 24 hours before docetaxel
administration. Docetaxel was administered as a 1-hour
infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (48 hours). Everolimus was taken orally on days 1 (within 5 minutes of starting docetaxel infusion) and 8 of each 21-day cycle, except
cycle 2 (Fig. 1). During cycle 2, everolimus was only
administered on day 8. This schedule allowed for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of each drug as a single agent and
as part of combination therapy. In the initial dosing
cohorts, docetaxel was fixed at a dose of 75 mg/m2 with
escalating doses of everolimus (Table 1); however, 2 of 2
patients developed DLT (infection/febrile neutropenia)

in the first dosing cohort (everolimus dose ¼ 30 mg on
days 1 and 8). Neither of these patients underwent
optional PK testing as defined within the protocol. The
study was redesigned with mandatory PK sampling and
used a 3-patient run-in dosing cohort of docetaxel (60
mg/m2 intravenously [IV] every 21 days) in combination
with 20 mg everolimus on days 1 and 8. The PK analyses
from these patients were used to determine dosing for subsequent cohorts (Table 1).
Treatment-related toxicity had to resolve to grade
1 before administration of subsequent cycles of therapy.
Day 8 of everolimus was held for grade 3 hematologic
or nonhematologic toxicity. Patients with grade 4 hematologic toxicity or grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity
underwent a 25% reduction in the dose of docetaxel during subsequent cycles. Patients who did not return to
grade 1 toxicity within 2 weeks of the start of the next

cycle of therapy or who developed recurrence of grade 4
hematologic or grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity despite a dose reduction in docetaxel were withdrawn from
protocol therapy.
PK Analysis
After the first 2 patients treated developed DLT, PK analyses were mandatory for the remaining patients enrolled.
PK blood sampling for everolimus was performed on cycle
1 day 1 (in combination with docetaxel) and cycle 2 day 8
(everolimus alone) predose and at 1, 2, 5, 8, and 24 hours
(5 minutes) after administration. PK sampling for docetaxel was performed on cycle 1 day 1 (in combination
with everolimus) and cycle 2 day 1 (docetaxel alone) using
the same sampling schedule as for everolimus, beginning
at the start of docetaxel infusion. Blood was collected by
direct venipuncture or an indwelling cannula inserted in a

the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, was 4 (range, 2-7).
All patients had received at least 1 line of chemotherapy in
the metastatic setting, with the majority of patients receiving >2 chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease
(Tables 2 and 3).
After the initial 2 patients treated developed DLT, a
3-patient run-in (docetaxel 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1, everolimus 20 mg PO on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) with
mandatory PK sampling demonstrated a significant
decrease of docetaxel clearance of 42% in 1 patient and a
slight increase (þ29%) in another (Table 3). Because of a
shipping error, cycle 2 day 1 blood samples were unavailable for analysis in the third patient treated within this
cohort. In addition, all patients treated in this dosing
cohort were unable to receive cycle 1 day 8 everolimus
because of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. Based upon these
data, subsequent patients were treated with a reduced dose
of docetaxel at 40 mg/m2 IV every 21 days with alternating doses of weekly everolimus.

were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 5 C, and
plasma samples were transferred into appropriately labeled vials and stored frozen (80 C) until analysis. All
drug analysis for both everolimus and docetaxel was completed at a Novartis (East Hanover, NJ) laboratory using
validated assays (on file at Novartis). PK parameters for
everolimus and docetaxel were estimated using standard
noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin version 5.0;
Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, Calif).

Fifteen patients were treated in this trial. The first 2
patients treated at the initial dosing cohort (docetaxel 75
mg/m2 IV on day 1, everolimus 30 mg orally [PO] on
days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) had DLT (infection/fever
with neutropenia), and subsequent cohorts underwent
mandatory PK testing. Patient characteristics are listed in

Toxicity
DLT occurred in 2 of 2 patients (100%, both neutropenic
fever/infection) treated at dose level 1 (75 mg/m2 docetaxel with 30 mg everolimus), in 1 of 3 patients (33%,
prolonged grade 4 neutropenia) treated at dose level 1
(60 mg/m2 docetaxel with 20 mg everolimus), and 2 of 8
patients (25%, 1 grade 3 stomatitis and 1 febrile neutropenia) treated at dose level 2 (40 mg/m2 docetaxel with
50 mg everolimus), as listed in Table 3. No patients
treated in dosing cohort 1 received day cycle 1 day 8
everolimus because of neutropenia, and 50% of patients
treated in dosing cohort 2 also did not receive cycle 1
day 8 everolimus. Several patients who received everolimus on day 8 of cycle 1 in dosing cohorts 2 and 3
were unable to receive day 8 of therapy on subsequent
cycles because of neutropenia. Two patients were treated
in dosing cohort 3 (40 mg/m2 docetaxel with 30 mg
everolimus) without DLT.
Myelosuppression was commonly seen, with the
majority of patients (73%) developing grade 3-4 neutropenia (Table 4). Anemia and thrombocytopenia were less
common and were low grade (Table 4). Commonly seen
nonhematologic toxicities are listed in Table 3 and
include low-grade fatigue (40%), mucositis (20%), and
hyperglycemia (20%). One patient had grade 3 mucositis
that was persistent and considered DLT. Other grade 2
nonhematologic toxicities occurred in only 7% of patients

Response
Of the 15 patients evaluable for response, none developed
a partial or complete response to therapy (Table 5). Eight
patients (53%) had stable disease (SD) as best response,
and 2 of these patients had SD 6 months, for a clinical
benefit rate of 13%. Seven patients (47%) developed progression of disease as best response to therapy.
PK Analysis
Of the 15 patients treated, PK data for docetaxel were
available in 10 patients and for everolimus in 11 patients
(the first 2 patients enrolled did not undergo optional PK
testing, 3 patients had samples incorrectly processed after
blood collection [docetaxel ¼ 2, everolimus ¼ 1], and 1
patient progressed after the first cycle of therapy). There
was wide variation in the clearance of both drugs as listed
in Table 3. Of the 13 patients treated during the mandatory PK requirements, 3 experienced DLT, and 7 did not
receive cycle 1 day 8 dosing of everolimus. Of the 3
patients with DLT, 2 were noted to have inhibition of the
clearance of everolimus by 9% to 23%, and 2 were noted
to have increased docetaxel clearance by 9% to 26%. One
patient had an increased clearance of both docetaxel and
everolimus. Because of small numbers, no distinct correlation could be made with drug clearance and DLT or cycle
1 day 8 dosing of everolimus.

DISCUSSION
Several trials have investigated the role of mTOR inhibition with everolimus for the reversal of drug resistance in
breast cancer. The aromatase inhibitor letrozole was combined with everolimus in the neoadjuvant setting and
demonstrated improved clinical response rates with
decreased proliferation (as measured by Ki67), compared
with letrozole alone.15 Everolimus in combination with
trastuzumab demonstrated a 15% response rate and a
34% clinical benefit rate in patients with human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)þ breast cancer that had
progressed on prior HER2-based therapy.16 Everolimus
has also been combined with chemotherapy and trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2þ, trastuzumab-refractory
breast cancer, with notable response rates of 15% to 20%.
A second study combining everolimus with paclitaxel and
weekly trastuzumab demonstrated a response rate of
20%.17

Based upon preclinical data supporting the role of
the PI3K/mTOR pathway in chemotherapy resistance,
this study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus given in
combination with docetaxel. Unfortunately, this study
demonstrated that combination dosing was associated
with a high rate of neutropenia that often precluded sustained weekly dosing of everolimus. DLT of neutropenic
infection/fever occurred in the first 2 patients treated with
standard-dose docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks) and
low-dose everolimus (30 mg PO weekly). Subsequent
dosing cohorts using lower doses of docetaxel (40-60 mg/
m2 IV every 3 weeks) did not substantially improve the
feasibility of weekly dosing, as only half of the patients
treated with 40 mg/m2 docetaxel in combination with 50
mg weekly everolimus were able to receive the cycle 1 day
8 everolimus dose.
Both everolimus and docetaxel are metabolized by
the cytochrome CYP3A4 isoenzyme.12,13 Metabolism of
docetaxel to M2 reduces drug activity and primarily
occurs by CYP3A4 oxidation of the tert-butyl side group
of the parent compound.13 PK alterations have been
noted when docetaxel was combined with either doxorubicin or etoposide.18 In addition, inhibition of CYP3A4
with ketoconazole resulted in a 49% decrease in clearance of docetaxel.19 Because docetaxel has a narrow therapeutic window, disruptions in drug metabolism could
lead to the toxicity seen within the first dosing cohort.
Noting this, subsequent patients treated after the first
dosing cohort were required to undergo mandatory
blood draws for PK analyses, which revealed a wide variation in metabolism of both docetaxel and everolimus
(Table 3). The noted variations, however, were not
strongly associated with DLT or withholding cycle 1 day

8 everolimus and thus cannot fully account for the difficulty maintaining an adequate dosing schedule. As previously mentioned, patients in this study were heavily
pretreated with chemotherapy, which is also likely to
confound the toxicity results.
No responses were noted on this study; however, 2
patients (13%) were noted to have stable disease for 6
months. The relevance of this observation is difficult to
assess in the phase 1 setting, which may select for patients
with slowly progressing or indolent disease.
Although there were 2 patients treated on dose level
3 (40 mg/m2 docetaxel with everolimus 30 mg PO
weekly) who did not develop DLT or miss cycle 1 day 8
everolimus, this was felt to be substandard dosing for both
drugs, and accrual to the trial was terminated because of
lack of response and concerns over the regimen’s feasibility. In addition, everolimus has been successfully administered in combination with paclitaxel, which is not
extensively metabolized through CYP3A4; thus, subsequent research can be pursued with this combination.20
Because neutropenia was the predominant DLT, alternative dosing schedules may also improve the feasibility of
this combination. For example, weekly dosing of docetaxel has been associated with less neutropenia and may be
a viable alternative for solid tumors other than breast cancer, as weekly administration of docetaxel has demonstrated reduced efficacy compared with triweekly dosing
in patients with metastatic breast cancer.21-23 Daily dosing of everolimus is also feasible and has been safely combined with every 3-week docetaxel (60 mg/m2) for the
treatment of patients with advanced lung cancer.24
