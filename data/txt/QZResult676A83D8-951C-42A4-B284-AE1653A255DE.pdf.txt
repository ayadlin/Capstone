BACKGROUND. We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study of erlotinib
plus bevacizumab in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who had
previously received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. These agents have activity in
non–small cell lung cancer, but their role in mesothelioma is unclear. The primary endpoint is response rate. Secondary endpoints include time to progression, survival, and toxicity.

METHODS. Eligible patients with mesothelioma who had previously received 1
chemotherapy regimen were treated with erlotinib 150 mg per os daily and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg administered intravenously on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or development of significant toxicity.
Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles using previously established

RESULTS. Twenty-four eligible patients initiated therapy with erlotinib and beva-

dence interval [CI], 1.4 months-5.9 months). The median survival was 5.8 months
(95% CI, 2.8 months-10.1 months). The most common toxicities were rash and
diarrhea. There were no treatment-related deaths, intracranial bleeding, or
hemoptysis.

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab was tolerated reasonably well, but there was no evidence of radiographic response. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of conducting trials in mesothelioma patients who
have failed first-line therapy. More therapeutic studies with effective agents are
needed for these patients. Cancer 2008;113:808–14.  2008 American Cancer

M

alignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a locally invasive tumor for which there are few effective treatment options. There
are an estimated 2200 new mesothelioma cases in the United States
each year, and the incidence worldwide is increasing.1 A small
minority of mesothelioma patients is appropriate for an attempt
at surgical resection; for unresectable patients, systemic chemotherapy remains the primary treatment. For patients with previously
untreated disease, therapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed is associated with a clinical response rate of 41%, a median time to progression of 5.7 months, and a median overall survival of 12.1
months.2 Phase 2 trials of patients with mesothelioma treated with
vinorelbine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, or ranpirnase have demon-

strated modest antitumor activity, with response
rates ranging from 0% to 24%.3-8 However, many of
these studies included previously untreated patients.
Despite reports that the use of second-line therapy
in mesothelioma is associated with improvements in
survival,9 there are currently no agents approved in
the United States for the treatment of mesothelioma
in patients who progress after initial chemotherapy,
and few trials have been conducted for relapsed
patients.
Preclinical work has shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors
(VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) may be potential targets in
the treatment of mesothelioma. VEGF, VEGFR1, and
VEGFR2 have all been detected in the majority of
mesothelioma tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.10-12 Moreover,
VEGF stimulates the proliferation of mesothelioma
cells in vitro, and this growth can be inhibited by the
use of purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies targeting
VEGF.12
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression has been detected by immunohistochemistry in
68%-96% of mesothelioma specimens, with a higher
incidence in epithelioid tumor specimens.13-15 Moreover, treatment of MPM cell lines derived from previously untreated patients (H2461, H2591, H2373,
and MSTO-211H) with the EGFR–tyrosine kinase
inhibitor gefitinib resulted in inhibition of EGFRdependent cell signaling and dose-dependent reduction of colony formation when MPM cells were
grown in soft agarose.16
On the basis of those preclinical data, a strategy
of dual inhibition of the VEGF and EGFR pathways
was pursued in patients with previously treated
mesothelioma. We initiated a trial of bevacizumab
plus erlotinib for patients who had received 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen for mesothelioma. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets
VEGF, has been approved to treat metastatic colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers in combination
with chemotherapy.17,18 Erlotinib, a small molecule
inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, has been
approved for use in patients with relapsed non–small
cell lung cancer and in pancreatic cancer.19,20 Phase
1 and 2 studies of the combination of these 2 drugs
have been investigated in patients with renal cell carcinoma21 and in patients with previously treated
non–small cell lung cancer.22 In that setting, the regimen was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical
activity. If this combination was found to have documented antitumor activity in mesothelioma, it would
be an important advance for patients whose treatment options are otherwise very limited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients had histologically or cytologically
confirmed malignant mesothelioma that was not
amenable to potentially curative surgery at the time
of enrollment. Patients were required to have been
treated with 1 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen.
Chemotherapy given into the pleural space or given
concurrently with radiation therapy as a radiation
sensitizer was not considered a prior systemic regimen. However, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was considered a prior regimen. Additional
mandatory inclusion criteria included age 18 years,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status 0-123; measurable or evaluable lesions, white
blood cell count 3000/lL, hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL,
platelet count 100, 000/lL, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/
dL, aspartate aminotransferase 2.5 3 institutional
upper limit of normal, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, and
life expectancy 12 weeks. Exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy within the last 21 days,
major surgery or radiation therapy within the last 28
days, prior treatment with erlotinib or other agent
targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor axis, prior treatment with bevacizumab or any
other angiogenesis inhibitor, any malignancy within
the past 5 years (excluding nonmelanoma skin
cancers, or definitively treated cervical cancer), clinically significant cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled
hypertension, previous myocardial infarction within
the last 12 months, congestive heart failure of New
York Heart Association grade 1 or greater, serious
cardiac dysrhythmia requiring medication, or peripheral vascular disease), history or evidence upon physical examination of central nervous system disease,
baseline proteinuria 11, any active gastrointestinal
disorder that alters motility or absorption, pregnancy
or lactation, evidence of tumor invasion into major vascular structures, gross hemoptysis (>¼teaspoonful of
blood) within the past 30 days, or severe and
unstable medical comorbidities. In addition, patients
who required daily treatment with aspirin, other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or any form of
systemic anticoagulation were excluded from study
entry.

Treatment
The study was approved by the institutional review
boards of each participating institution. All patients
gave written, informed consent. Baseline assessment
included a history and physical examination, complete blood count and serum chemistries, urinalysis
for evidence of proteinuria, electrocardiogram, preg-

nancy testing in women of childbearing age, and
computed tomography of the chest and abdomen.
Patients were treated with erlotinib 150 mg per
os daily without interruption and bevacizumab 15
mg/kg administered intravenously on Day 1 of a 21day cycle. Treatment was continued until the development of disease progression, severe or unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of patient consent. At the
start of each 21-day cycle, patients underwent
assessment of performance status, adverse events,
physical examination, and laboratory studies, including urinalysis. Tumor assessment by computerized
tomography was evaluated after every 2 cycles of
therapy.
Tumor response was assessed using the original
Byrne and Nowak criteria that have been previously
employed in recent clinical studies of mesothelioma.24 Measurable lesions were considered bidimensional (clearly defined margins, with at least 1
image with both diameters 1.0 cm) or unidimensional (eg, pleural rind, with at least 1 measurement
of thickness 1.5 cm). A complete response was
defined as complete absence of measurable, nonmeasurable but assessable, and unassessable disease
with no new lesions and no disease-related symptoms. A partial response was defined as 50% reduction from baseline of the sum of the products of
perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable disease when only such disease was present;
30% decrease in the sum of the greatest diameters
of unidimensionally measurable lesions when only
such disease was present; or reduction of either type
of disease as defined above with the other type at
least stable when both types were present, with
nonmeasurable disease being at least stable, and
with no new lesions. Any complete or partial response required confirmation at least 4 weeks later.
Tumor progression was defined as the appearance of
a new or relapsed lesion, a 50% increase in the sum
of products of all bidimensionally measurable
lesions, a 25% increase in the sum of the longest
dimension of unidimensionally measurable lesions,
or death from disease. Stable disease was noted
when criteria were not met for either progression or
response.
Toxicity was graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. There
were no planned dose reductions for bevacizumab.
Patients who developed grade 3 thrombosis or
hemorrhage were discontinued from the study.
Patients who developed grade 3 proteinuria or
hypertension discontinued bevacizumab, although
they could continue erlotinib in the absence of other
significant toxicities. Patients with other toxicities of

grade 3 were permitted dose delays of up to 14
days and could restart treatment at full-dose bevacizumab and reduced-dose erlotinib if toxicities
improved to grade 2 within that timeframe. Up to 2
dose reductions of erlotinib (first to 100 mg daily,
then to 50 mg daily) were permitted for each patient.

Statistical Methods
This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study was based
on a 2-stage Simon design.25 The primary endpoint
of the study was response. Continuation past the first
stage was based on detection of at least 2 responses
among the first 25 subjects enrolled. If at least 2
responses were detected, enrollment would continue
to a total of 37 patients. Secondary endpoints
included time to progression, duration of response,
survival, and toxicity.
Best clinical response to treatment was assessed
using the criteria described above, and response
rates were calculated for the enrolled population.
Fisher exact test was used to examine the association
of key patient and tumor characteristics with the rate
of stable disease.26 Median time to progression and
survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method.27 Outcomes were censored if an endpoint
was not reached by the time of last follow-up, or if a
patient was lost to follow-up. Univariate analyses of
time to progression (TTP) and survival employed the
log-rank test to examine effects of key patient and
tumor characteristics. All P-values are based on a 2sided hypothesis test. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), version
9.1.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-six patients from 3 centers were enrolled
between February 2004 and October 2006. Two
patients were declared ineligible for the trial before
initiation of any treatment: 1 was ineligible due to a
preexisting cerebral aneurysm that had required
surgical intervention in the past, and a second was
declared ineligible due to poor performance status.
For the 24 remaining patients, Table 1 shows the
baseline patient and disease characteristics. Patients
were predominantly men (62%), white (96%), and
had a PS 5 1 (67%), with 2 thirds of patients having
epithelioid histology. Forty-one percent of patients
had undergone prior surgical resection, and 25%
had previously been irradiated. Twenty-one (88%)
patients had received a previous pemetrexed-containing regimen.

Toxic Effects
All 24 patients treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab were included in the analysis of treatmentrelated toxicity. The most common adverse events
were rash and diarrhea, though these were largely
mild and easily managed. See Table 2 for a listing of
treatment-related toxicities.
Eight (33%) patients required dose reduction of
erlotinib: 5 for rash, 2 for diarrhea, and 1 for dysphagia. Two patients required discontinuation of erloti-

811

nib for treatment-related diarrhea, whereas a third
discontinued treatment due to fatigue. Seven patients
developed low-grade proteinuria, although only 1
required discontinuation of bevacizumab for grade 2
proteinuria. In addition, there were 2 thromboembolic events (1 pulmonary embolus, 1 deep vein
thrombosis). There were no cases of intracranial
bleeding, stroke, cardiac events, hemoptysis, or treatment-related death.

Response
The median number of treatment cycles administered was 3 (range, 1-30). Twelve of 24 (50%) patients
received 2 or fewer cycles of therapy, whereas only 7
patients (29%) received 6 or more cycles of therapy.
There were no objective responses among the 24
patients treated. Therefore, the trial could not meet
its interim endpoint of 2 responses among the first
25 patients, and the trial did not continue into the
second stage of enrollment.
Stable disease was achieved in 12 patients (50%),
whereas the remaining 12 patients developed progressive disease as their best response to treatment.
All but 1 of the 8 patients (88%) with performance
status of 0 developed stable disease, compared with
only 5 of the 16 patients (31%) with performance status of 1 (P 5 .027). Ten of the 16 patients with
epithelioid histology (63%) developed stable disease,
compared with only 2 of 8 patients (25%) with either
biphasic or sarcomatoid histology; however, given
the small sample size, this correlation was not statistically significant (P 5 .193). Furthermore, there was
no statistically significant correlation between development of stable disease and age, sex, prior surgery,
prior radiation, best response to prior chemotherapy,
baseline blood counts, the presence of baseline
thrombocytosis, or weight loss.
Time to Progression and Survival
All 24 treated patients were evaluated for time to
progression and survival, with a minimum potential
follow-up of 8.9 months and a median potential follow-up of 22.5 months. At the time of analysis, 21
patients had developed objective progression. One
patient with stable disease on therapy withdrew from
the study after 3 cycles of treatment and was subsequently lost to follow-up. Two other patients had
radiologically stable disease at the time they were
removed from the study due to declining performance status, and they were subsequently lost to follow-up for progression. There have been 22 deaths,
with 2 patients still alive at the time of analysis.
The median time to progression was 2.2 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 months-5.9

were 29% and 6%, respectively (Fig. 1). Median survival was 5.8 months (95% CI, 2.8 months-10.1

46% and 24%, respectively (Fig. 2).
Both time to progression and overall survival
were analyzed with respect to key baseline patient

characteristics, including age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status,
histologic subtype, weight loss at presentation, prior
surgery for mesothelioma, best response to prior
chemotherapy, and baseline blood counts. A performance status of 0 (P 5 .007), a white blood cell
count <8.3 3 109 L (P 5 .058), and epithelioid histol-

ogy (P 5 .065) were the factors associated with some
improvement in time to progression by univariate
analysis. Epithelioid histology (P 5 .005), a white
blood cell count <8.3 3 109 L (P 5 .035), no weight
loss at presentation (P 5 .053) and performance status of 0 (P 5 .054) were associated with prolonged
overall survival.

DISCUSSION
To date, there has been limited success in the development of systemic therapies for patients with
malignant mesothelioma. In the first-line setting,
treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed is associated with a response rate of 41%, median TTP of
5.7 months, and a median survival of 12.1 months.2
For those patients who progress after first-line therapy, the number of treatment options declines precipitously. There are currently no agents specifically
approved in the US for the treatment of mesothelioma patients who have progressed after prior
chemotherapy. In fact, the current study is only the
second published trial focused exclusively on
patients with mesothelioma who have progressed after 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Our trial studied
erlotinib plus bevacizumab in patients who had previously received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for
mesothelioma. A previously reported trial investigated the role of ZD0473, a platinum analog, in a
population of patients previously treated with chemotherapy.28 In both of these trials, no partial or complete responses were achieved. Median time to
progression was less than 3 months in each study
(2.2 months for erlotinib plus bevacizumab, 2.4
months for ZD0473), and median overall survival in
each study was about 6 months from the time of
enrollment (5.9 months for erlotinib plus bevacizumab, 6.8 months for ZD0473). Although neither study
found significant clinical benefit, these 2 trials
demonstrate the feasibility of conducting clinical
trials in mesothelioma patients who have progressed
after prior chemotherapy.
As previously demonstrated, the combination of
erlotinib plus bevacizumab was reasonably well tolerated in these patients with a thoracic malignancy.
This combination has previously been studied in
non–small cell lung cancer, with few grade 3-4 toxicities.22 The rates of grade 3 of 4 events with this regimen in both the lung cancer trial and our
mesothelioma trial were similar. Unlike the experience in patients with lung cancer, however, the combination did not cause tumor regression in patients
with malignant mesothelioma. There were no objective regressions, the median time to progression was

813

2.2 months, and median overall survival was 5.8
months. However, there were 5 patients (21%) who
remained stable on treatment for at least 6 months,
with 1 patient continuing on treatment for 21 months.
Other recently presented studies echo the limited
activity of these agents in mesothelioma. Two singleagent trials of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors failed
to show significant activity in previously untreated
mesothelioma patients.15,29 Meanwhile, 2 recently
presented trials failed to show benefit for the use of
VEGF inhibition in mesothelioma.30,31
The factors most closely associated with better
outcomes in this trial were an ECOG performance
status of 0, epithelioid histology, and a baseline white
blood cell count that was not elevated. Not surprisingly, these are among the most commonly cited
favorable prognostic factors in mesothelioma.32,33 It
is likely that these factors are again prognostic of a
more indolent tumor rather than predictive of treatment benefit.
There is a clear need for further study of agents
in mesothelioma patients who have progressed after
initial chemotherapy. The incidence of the disease is
increasing worldwide, resection will be appropriate
for few patients, and many patients will require treatment beyond their initial chemotherapy regimen. A
recent follow-up study of a phase 3 trial of cisplatin
plus pemetrexed versus cisplatin alone in mesothelioma showed that 189 of the 448 patients (42%)
went on to receive subsequent poststudy chemotherapy. We need to increase our commitment to studying the use of agents in this patient population.
