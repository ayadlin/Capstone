ABSTRACT
Purpose: Addition of bevacizumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in HER2-positive inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) was associated
with favorable outcome in the BEVERLY-2 phase II trial. Circulating levels of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 were correlated to high response rate and
prolonged survival in high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab. We examined
the prognostic impact of MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels in BEVERLY-2 patients.
Experimental design: MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were assessed using ELISA
at baseline and before surgery in 45/52 available samples. Correlations were tested

with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall
survival (OS).
Results: Baseline (b) MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were independent from
patient characteristics and circulating tumor or endothelial cells, and were not
correlated to pCR. High bMMP2 was correlated to better DFS (p=0.001) and OS
(p=0.032), while low bMMP9 was correlated to better OS (p=0.022) and tended to
be associated with longer DFS (p=0.071). In multivariate analyses, bMMP2 (p=0.003,
Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.115) and bMMP9 (p=0.041, HR: 3.511) remained correlated
to DFS. As continuous variables, bMMP2 was associated with relapse (p=0.002)
and death (p=0.049), while bMMP9 was associated with death (p=0.035). During
treatment, significant increase in MMP2 and decrease in MMP9 levels (p<0.001 for
both) were observed in 100% and 87% of patients respectively.
Conclusions: High bMMP2 and low bMMP9 serum levels were associated
with better survival in HER2-positive IBC patients treated with bevacizumab- and
trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Their predictive value of bevacizumab
benefit should be evaluated in a randomized trial.

(MMP2) and 9 (MMP9) belong to the MMP family, whose
activity is implicated in proteolysis of extra-cellular matrices,
regulation of cell adhesion and migration, processing of
growth factors and cytokines, and liberation of angiogenic
factors [7]. We recently reported the association between the
baseline circulating MMP2 level and, to a lesser extent, the
MMP9 level, and the response rate, PFS and OS of patients
treated with bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma
[8]. A baseline of high and low plasma levels of MMP2 and
MMP9 respectively were associated with a high response
rate and a prolonged progression-free survival and OS in
recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab.
Moreover, no association was found with patient survival
in a similar population treated with cytotoxic agents only
without anti-angiogenic therapy, suggesting a specific
predictive value of these biomarkers.
BEVERLY-2 study included a prospective collection
of serum samples before initiation of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and before surgical resection. In this study,
our objective was to evaluate the prognostic impact of
MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels, at baseline and during
treatment, in patients with IBC treated with neoadjuvant
bevacizumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an uncommon
(5% of all cases) but highly aggressive form of breast cancer
[1]. IBC is clinically characterized by a rapidly growing
edema and erythema of the breast involving at least 1/3 of the
skin breast, and may include at the pathological level tumor
emboli in the dermal lymphatics [2]. Even though significant
improvements were achieved with multimodal treatment,
the 5-year survival rate is only ~ 40%, and the prognosis of
IBC remains worse than that of non-inflammatory locally
advanced breast cancer [1]. Biologically, IBC remains
poorly understood but includes a high vascularity and
an increased micro-vessel density consistent with a high
expression of angiogenic factors, including the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) [2]. This led to the
evaluation of anti-angiogenic therapies in this disease.
In the recent open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II
BEVERLY-2 study, neoadjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab
was added to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and adjuvant trastuzumab in patients with nonmetastatic
HER2-positive IBC leading to a high pathological complete
response (pCR) rate of more than 60% [3] and promising
3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
rates of 68 and 90%, respectively. However, in the absence
of a randomized design, the specific impact of bevacizumab
was not established. In addition, the use of bevacizumab in
breast cancer was recently challenged. Thus, biomarkers able
to predict bevacizumab benefit in breast cancer, including
HER2-positive IBC, would be of a crucial interest. Ideal
biomarkers should be easily measurable, on multiple points
upon treatment, and standardized [4]. Baseline levels and/
or variation of numerous intratumor or circulating candidate
prebiomarkers have been explored [5]. In-situ prebiomarkers
such as VEGFA, VEGF-R2 or CA9, as well as circulating
prebiomarkers such as VEGFA, VEGFR1, ICAM1, IL6, IL8
or circulating tumor cells count [6] were reported to predict
bevacizumab benefit, but this predictive value was generally
weak and rarely confirmed [5]. Matrix metalloproteinases 2

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and baseline (b) MMP2
and MMP9 serum levels
Serums were available for 45 of 52 patients
included in the trial. Characteristics of this patients’
subset were similar to those of the entire population
(Table 1). In our population, pCR was observed in
73.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 59.0-84.0) of
patients. After a median follow-up of 3 years, 5 patients
died and 14 presented disease recurrence. Median DFS
and OS were not reached. The 3-year DFS and OS rates
were 67.8% (95% CI: 55.2-83.3) and 88.1% (95%CI:
78.8-98.5), respectively.

At baseline, median bMMP2 and bMMP9 serum
levels were 203.6 ng/ml (range, 116.2-338.9) and 629.6
ng/ml (range, 191-1189), respectively, and were inversely
correlated (R= -0.498, p=0.001).

HR: 0.115) and bMMP9 (p=0.041, HR: 3.511) remained
significantly and oppositely correlated to DFS. Thus,
3-year DFS rates were 52.4% versus 91% for patients with
low versus high bMMP2 serum level respectively, while
DFS rates were 86.4% versus 56.5% for patients with low
and high bMMP9.
As continuous variables, bMMP2 (p=0.021), but
not bMMP9 (p=0.250) levels were correlated to DFS,
whereas bMMP2 (p=0.098) and bMMP9 (p=0.068) levels
presented a borderline significant trend for correlation
to OS. Moreover, bMMP2 (p=0.049, AUC: 0.801) and
bMMP9 (p=0.035, AUC: 0.793) levels were significantly
correlated to the risk of death, while bMMP2 serum levels
were correlated to the risk of recurrence (p=0.002, AUC:
0.805) (Figure 2).

bMMP2 and bMMP9 levels and correlation with
histo-clinical features
We searched for correlations between the bMMP2
and bMMP9 serum levels and histo-clinical features. As
shown in Supplementary Table 1, no significant correlation
existed with patient’s age, HR status and SBR grade.
bMMP2 and bMMP9 levels were not associated with the
count of baseline CTC and CEC, analyzed as continuous
or qualitative variables.

bMMP2 and bMMP9 serum levels and
correlation with clinical outcome

Exploratory scoring systems and ratio analysis
Given the opposite prognostic value of bMMP2
and bMMP9 levels, we divided our patient population
in four classes: high bMMP2 and low bMMP9 (N=16),
high bMMP2 and high bMMP9 (N=6), low bMMP2 and
low bMMP9 (N=6), and low bMMP2 and high bMMP9
(N=15) serum levels. These four classes were significantly
associated with DFS (p=0.015) and OS (p=0.033). All
death events were observed in the worse subgroup defined
by low bMMP2 and high bMMP9 serum levels (Figure
3). At the 3-year follow-up, DFS rates were 94% in the
“high bMMP2/low bMMP9” class, 83% in the “high
bMMP2/high bMMP9” class, 50% in the “low bMMP2/
low bMMP9” class, and 43% in the “low bMMP2/high
bMMP9” class, while OS rates were 100%, 100%, 100%,
and 71%, respectively.

Neither bMMP2 nor bMMP9 in continuous
values were correlated to pCR (p=0.277 and p=0.104,
respectively). So, for each MMP, subjects were divided
into two groups (high and low bMMP) using the median
value as cutoff. As binary variables, bMMP9 (p=0.208)
and bMMP2 (p=0.146) were not correlated to pCR. By
contrast, correlations existed with survival. In univariate
analyses (Table 2), high bMMP2 was associated with
longer DFS (p=0.001) and OS (p=0.032), whereas high
bMMP9 was associated with worse OS (p=0.022) and
tended to be associated with worse DFS (p=0.071)
(Figure 1). Because of the low number of death events,
multivariate analysis was only performed for DFS and
included SBR grade (p=0.057). Both bMMP2 (p=0.003,

as part of their treatment. Their clinical characteristics are
shown in Supplementary Table 2. Expression levels were
heterogeneous across samples with a range of intensities
over 3 decades in log10 scale (Figure S2). We searched
for correlations (Fisher’s exact test) between MMPs
expression status (“high” versus “low” groups) and histoclinical variables in IBC samples (Table S3). Regarding
MMP2 expression, no correlation was found with patients’
age, histological type and grade, ER and PR, whereas
high expression was associated with HER2-positive status
(p=0.039). Regarding MMP9 expression, no correlation
was found with age, histological type and HER2 status,
whereas high expression was associated with higher grade
(p=0.020), ER-negative status (p=0.002) and PR-negative
status (p=0.0007). Neither MMP2 nor MMP9 RNA
expression levels were correlated to pathological response
and to metastasis-free survival (Table S4).

MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels changes during
treatment and outcome
Post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy pre-surgery (ps)
samples were available for 31 patients: median psMMP2
and psMMP9 serum levels were 298.5 ng/ml (range,
195.7-552.9) and 319.9 ng/ml (range, 20.1-858.4),
respectively. Under treatment, all patients experienced an
increase in psMMP2 serum level (p<0.001), while 87% of
patients had a decrease in psMMP9 serum level (p<0.0.01)
(Figure 4). psMMP2 and psMMP9 serum levels tended
to be inversely correlated (R=-0.308, p=0.092). By
contrast, the magnitudes of changes of MMP2 and MMP9
serum levels were not correlated (p=0.991) and were not
associated with DFS or OS.

DISCUSSION

Tumor MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA expressions
in IBC

This analysis showed for the first time to our
knowledge that, in the HER2-positive IBC patient
population of the BEVERLY-2 trial, baseline MMP2
and MMP9 serum levels are associated with DFS and
OS, are anti-correlated, and significantly changed during
bevacizumab- and trastuzumab-based neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy. These results are in accordance with the
predictive value of these biomarkers for bevacizumab
benefit, we recently reported in patients with recurrent high

Since only a limited number of frozen tumor
samples were available from BEVERLY-2 patients,
we analyzed MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA expression in
137 clinical IBC samples profiled within the World
IBC Consortium (E-MTAB-1006, E-MTAB-1547 and
GSE22597). None of these patients received bevacizumab

grade glioma [8]. Such predictive value was not found in
glioma patients untreated with bevacizumab. Whether the
same is true in HER2-positive IBC patients would ideally
require a control group in a randomized design. To our
knowledge, serum MMP2 and MMP9 dosages have not
been reported in IBC, limiting access to some historical
control. Despite that point, the similar results observed
in glioma and HER2-positive IBC reinforce the interest
of these biomarkers as predictive factors candidate for
prediction of bevacizumab activity.
Given the increasing use and cost of antiangiogenic
agents, and the heterogeneity of their benefit, particularly
for bevacizumab, biomarkers of efficacy that could
drive their therapeutic use, remain an unmet need in
oncology [4]. In breast cancer, the use of bevacizumab
was associated with a weak and debated activity,
leading to the withdrawal of the FDA authorization and
highlighting the especial need for predictive biomarkers.
In the particular context of HER2-positive IBC, this is a
critically important issue. Indeed, the BEVERLY-2 study
demonstrated a high anti-tumor activity in terms of pCR
and survival outcomes, comparing very favorably with
historical controls [6]. However, other attractive strategies
in this patient population may include optimization of antiHER2 targeting using double blockade combination such
as trastuzumab-pertuzumab [13] or trastuzumab-lapatinib
associations [14]. Thus, predictive biomarkers that could
help selecting among these two innovative approaches
might be particularly useful.
Numerous studies explored potential predictive
biomarkers for bevacizumab efficiency in breast cancer,
but to date, none has been validated [5]. Hypertension
and polymorphisms affecting the VEGFA pathway
have shown some predictive value of bevacizumab
benefit, although their limitations included lack of
standardization, and inconsistent effect among studies.
Tissue expressions of VEGFA, CD31, and PDGFRβ
were associated with response, but their predictive value
was not confirmed [15]. Moreover, baseline circulating
biomarkers such as VEGFA, soluble VEGFR2, VCAM1, and E-Selectin as well as circulating endothelial cells
have been associated with outcome [16, 17]. However,
their predictive value was inconsistent between studies.
Recently, we reported that CTC count at baseline had
an independent prognostic impact restricted to DFS in
the BEVERLY-2 trial [6]. Interestingly, we did not find
any correlation between baseline CTC count and MMP2
or MMP9 serum levels. We observed MMP serum
levels variations during treatment: MMP2 increased
for all patients and MMP9 decreased for most of them.
Interestingly, we found similar results in our cohort of
bevacizumab-treated glioma patients, with an increase
of MMP2 and a decrease of MMP9 plasma levels during
treatment before progression. In addition, in glioma
patients, MMP2 plasma level significantly decreased
at the time of progression. Variations of circulating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

markers were already reported under anti-angiogenic
therapies, but their predictive values were limited [18].
Thus, MMP2 and MMP9 plasma levels could allow
the initial patients’ selection, but also could help in the
treatment monitoring.
MMP2 and MMP9 belong to the matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) family, whose activity has been
implicated in proteolysis of extra-cellular matrix. [7]. In
breast cancer, MMP9 was reported to be highly expressed,
in contrast to MMP2. Moreover, MMP2 seems to have
no prognostic value for breast cancer patients while the
prognostic impact of tissue expression or circulating level
of MMP9 remains controversial [19, 20]. In this study, we
have examined, for the first time in the literature, MMP2
and MMP9 mRNA tumor expression in a large population
of IBC patients from the world IBC consortium but no
relationship was found with pCR or survival. Of note,
none of these patients had received bevacizumab in their
initial neoadjuvant treatment. Thus, even though no data
was available on corresponding serum levels, the lack of
prognostic value observed for MMP2 and MMP9 tumor
expression in this retrospective cohort may argue in favor
of a predictive and specific impact of these markers for
bevacizumab benefit.
One intriguing result of our study was the opposite
correlation and prognostic impact of MMP2 and MMP9.
MMP2 has been involved in angiogenesis, associated to
pericyte recruitment, vascular maturation and functionality
via multiple effectors [21, 22]. Interestingly, in orthotopic
mouse model of glioblastoma completely devoid of MMP2
activity, tumor vascularity appeared to be less functional
with reduction of VEGFR2 expression in tumor vessels
and decrease of pericyte coverage [21]. In another model
of lung cancer, MMP2 was reported to be implicated in the
VEGFA expression by the tumor cells, through the PI3K/
Akt pathway, underlining the major role played by MMP2
in the angiogenic process [22]. By contrast, MMP9 seems
implicated in another vascularization process, called
vasculogenesis, based on the recruitment of circulating
endothelial and myeloid precursors [23]. Thus, these
distinct roles in the tumor vascularization, supported by
the inverse correlation of their serum concentrations, could
explain their opposite predictive effect for bevacizumab
activity.
Our study presented some limitations. The sample
size of our population was small but related to the rarity
of this disease. This limited number of patients and events
could explain the borderline significance of our continuous
analysis results. In this context, the exploratory results
could be carefully interpreted taking into account these
limitations.
However, the anti-correlation of the survival impact
of these two markers evaluated in serum, their changes
under bevacizumab as well as their similar impact
observed in glioma treated with bevacizumab reinforce
their potential value.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

stored, and transported at –80°C or lower. Serums were
thawed immediately before analysis. In the present study,
serums at baseline and before surgery were analyzed
for levels of MMP2 and MMP9 using commercially
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay
kits (R&D Systems®). Samples were run in duplicate, and
the average was recorded. Serum levels were analyzed as
continuous values and as binary values using the median
value as cutoff. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and
circulating endothelial cells (CEC) counts were measured
in blood samples as previously published [6] using
CellSearch.

Study design and patient population
BEVERLY-2 was a single-arm, multicenter, nonrandomized phase II study. Study design, inclusion
criteria and patient characteristics, as well as procedures,
treatment (Figure S1, supplementary methods), efficacy
and safety results have been previously published [3, 6].
All patients had a centrally reviewed HER-2 positive non
metastatic IBC, defined as T4d (any N), or PEV2 or 3
according to the PEV (Poussée EVolutive) classification.
Written informed consent was provided by patients
before any screening procedure and was required for the
translational research studies. The study was approved
by the ethical board (Comité de Protection des Personnes
Sud Méditerranée I) and registered (NCT00717405 and
EUDRACT 2008-000783-16).

mRNA expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in
IBC tumor samples
MMP2 and MMP9 expressions have not been
described in IBC tumor samples. Unfortunately, no
frozen tumor sample from patients treated in the Beverly
2 trial was available for analysis. We thus analysed the
gene expression dataset of the World IBC Consortium
that included the whole-genome transcriptional profiles
of 137 IBC profiled using Affymetrix DNA microarrays
[9, 10]. The series and experiments have been described
[9, 10], as well as the preprocessing of data. MMP2 and
MMP9 mRNA expressions were measured by analyzing
the 201069_at and 203936_at Affymetrix probe sets
respectively, whose identity and specificity were verified
using the NCBI program BLASTN 2.2.31+ and showed
100% accuracy. Expression was measured as discrete
value by using the median expression level as cut-off:
“high” expression was superior to the median, and “low”
was inferior.

Procedures and treatment
Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
consisting of 4 three-weekly cycles of FEC100 (500mg/
m2 fluorouracil, 100 mg/m2 epirubicin, 500 mg/m2
cyclophosphamide) plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg),
followed by four 3-weekly cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/
m2), bevacizumab (15 mg/kg), and trastuzumab (initially
at a loading-dose of 8 mg/kg, and then a dose of 6 mg/
kg). Surgical treatment consisted of mastectomy and
axillary lymph node dissection. Bevacizumab was stopped
4 weeks prior to surgery and resumed (for a further 30
weeks) once the wound was healed entirely, during or after
radiotherapy. Patients continued receiving trastuzumab (6
mg/kg) during the perioperative period which continued
for another 30 weeks following surgery (42 weeks in
total). Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered according
to standard practice in combination with trastuzumab,
and bevacizumab. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)positive tumors received adjuvant hormone therapy.

Statistical analysis
For evaluation of pCR, Sataloff criteria were used
[3]. Central review of tissue blocks was required for
each patient and pCR was defined as a total or near total
treatment effect with loss of nodal involvement (Sataloff
classification TA and NA or NB) [11]. DFS was defined as
time from first administration of neoadjuvant treatment to
local, regional or distant recurrence, contralateral breast
cancer, second primary cancer (other than squamous
or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ,
carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colon carcinoma in situ,
or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast) or death from
any cause. OS was defined using death from any cause.
We analyzed MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels data with
descriptive analyses, in terms of the variation between
time points and correlation with pCR and survivals.
Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and
percentages, continuous variables as median and range.
Comparisons of categorical variables distribution were
performed by χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. For continuous
variables, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used.

Blood sample collection and serum analysis
Additional blood samples (2 x 7.5 mL) were taken
from patients at different times(supplementary methods):
(1) before the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and
bevacizumab (baseline); (2) before the first trastuzumab
administration during the neoadjuvant period (cycle
5); (3) before the surgical procedure (cycle 8); (4)
during the adjuvant period before the reintroduction of
bevacizumab (post-operative assessment); and (5) at
the final visit at the end of adjuvant treatment (one-year
follow-up). After collection of the whole blood, samples
were allowed to clot at room temperature during 15-30
minutes. Then, serum was obtained by centrifuging at
2,000 x g for 10 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge.
Serum was immediately distributed into 0.5 ml aliquots,

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival
distributions. Log-rank tests were used for univariate
comparisons. Cox proportional hazards models were
used for multivariate analyses and to estimate hazard
ratios in survival regression models. Multivariate analysis
included all variables with a p-value < 0.10. Baseline and
pre-surgical values of MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels
were compared using with the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. Correlations were analyzed using the Spearman
test. All reported p-values are two-sided, and p<0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed by paswstatistics.version21®.

antiangiogenic therapy: how do we move from candidate biomarkers to valid biomarkers? J Clin Oncol.
2010;28:183–185.

This analysis performed in the BEVERLY-2 phase II
trial identified MMP2 and MMP9 as candidate biomarkers
correlated consistently to DFS and OS in patients with
HER2-positive inflammatory breast cancer. The prediction
of bevacizumab benefit versus a prognostic value of
MMP2/MMP9 should be assessed ideally in controlled
studies. Further studies are needed to reinvestigate the
biological role of MMP2 and MMP9 and their interaction
with the VEGFA pathway.
