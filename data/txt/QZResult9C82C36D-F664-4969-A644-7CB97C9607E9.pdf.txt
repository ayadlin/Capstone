BACKGROUND. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are overexpressed in Kaposi
sarcoma (KS). The safety and efficacy of a novel, orally bioavailable MMP inhibitor, BMS-275291, was evaluated in patients with human immunodeficiency virusassociated KS and the correlation between changes in the percentage of apoptotic cells in tumor biopsies and response was explored.

METHODS. Cohorts of 6 patients were to be treated with BMS-275291. The initial
cohort received 1200 mg once a day; subsequent doses were to be escalated to
600 mg twice daily and 1200 mg twice daily, or decreased to 600 mg/day. Tumor
biopsies for apoptosis assays were collected pretreatment and on Day 29. Prospectively defined dose level adjustments were to be based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), tolerability, changes in the percentage of apoptotic cells, and
treatment response.

RESULTS. Sixteen patients were enrolled; 15 received the study drug and could be
evaluated. The median duration of treatment was 20 weeks (range, 3–54 weeks). A
dose of 1200 mg once a day was well tolerated but induced only 1 response. A DLT
occurred in 3 patients treated with 600 mg twice daily, and included grade 3 fatigue,
grade 3 allergic reaction, and grade 3 arthralgias; 2 responses were noted at this
dose level (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]). Based on predetermined endpoints, the trial was
closed after accrual of 15 treated patients. Assessment of biologic response for dose
escalation/de-escalation decisions utilizing the apoptosis assay was not feasible.

CONCLUSIONS. BMS-275291 given at a dose of 600 mg twice daily induced unacceptable toxicity. The better-tolerated schedule of 1200 mg once a day demonstrated inadequate efficacy in patients with human immunodeficiency virusassociated KS. The apoptosis assay was not helpful in predicting response. Cancer

aposi sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal angioproliferative malignancy with a variable clinical presentation. Although its incidence has declined in
developed countries since the introduction of highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the standardized incidence ratio for KS among people with the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) remained >3600-fold higher in the post-HAART period
(1996–2002) than in the general population in the
U.S,1 and recent data suggest that incidence rates
may be increasing.2 Although active treatments for
KS are available,3 the growing understanding of KS
pathogenesis provides a rationale for new therapeutic
approaches.4,5
KS lesions are characterized by aberrant angiogenesis, inflammation, and proliferation of endothelial-derived spindle cells.6,7 The KS-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) is required for KS development.
KSHV encodes novel proteins as well as viral homologs of human proteins known to be involved in signaling and cancer. These induce signaling events
that lead to induction of cytokines, such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and induce constitutive expression of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs).7–12 In a murine model, the tissue inhibitor
of MMP-2 was shown to inhibit the development of
KS-like lesions, suggesting that inhibition of MMP
activity might have therapeutic value for patients
with AIDS-associated KS.13
MMPs are a group of more than 20 structurally
related zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade
proteins of the extracellular matrix and basement
membrane. They mediate normal tissue remodeling
and are essential for embryogenesis, wound healing,
and angiogenesis; MMP-2 and MMP-9 are of particular interest because preclinical models suggest that
they are essential components of the metastatic process.14,15
The potential of MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) as
therapeutic agents for cancer has been investigated
for more than 20 years. Early-generation MMPIs
demonstrated modest antitumor activity, but their
usefulness was limited because of poor oral bioavailability and dose-limiting polyarthritis.16–18 MMPIinduced arthralgias and myalgias are believed to be
caused by inhibition of sheddases, which are MMPs
that regulate shedding of cell surface mediators of
inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, the TNF-a receptor, and the interleukin
(IL)-6 receptor.
BMS-275291 is an orally bioavailable, rationally
designed, nonpeptidomimetic MMPI. Inhibition is
selective for MMPs-1, -2, -7, -9, -13, and -14, while
sparing sheddases.19 BMS-275291 induced a dose-de-

pendent reduction in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis in animal models20,21 and induced limited
toxicity in a phase 1 study in patients with nonhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related cancers
who received doses of up to 2400 mg/day.22
The major objectives of the current study were
to evaluate the safety and toxicity of BMS-275291 in
patients with AIDS-associated KS, to explore the relation between tumor response and the change in the
percentage of apoptotic cells in KS biopsies, and to
determine whether this biologic endpoint could be
used as a criterion for dose escalation or de-escalation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were required to have biopsy-proven KS
with at least 5 measurable cutaneous lesions; serologic documentation of HIV infection; age 16 years;
life expectancy 3 months; a Karnofsky performance
status 60; and adequate hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic function. Women of childbearing potential
were required to have a negative serum b-human
chorionic gonadotropin within 72 hours of study
entry and to practice adequate birth control.
HAART was permitted but not required; patients
receiving HAART were required to be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks without evidence of KS
regression. Antineoplastic therapies within 3 weeks
of study entry were not permitted.
Subjects with symptomatic visceral KS requiring
chemotherapy, concurrent infection, another neoplasm, treatment with corticosteroids or investigational drugs, or previous local therapy to KS
indicator lesions were excluded. Because MMPs
influence bone development, nursing women were
excluded. All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the human experimentation
guidelines of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services and the Human Investigations Committee at each participating site.
Study Design
BMS-275291 was supplied as 600-mg tablets by the
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) through a collaborative agreement with Bristol Myers-Squibb (Wallingford, CT).
Cohorts of 6 subjects were to be sequentially
assigned to 1 of 3 dose levels: level I, a single dose of
1200 mg/day; level II, 600 mg twice daily; and level
III, 1200 mg twice daily. Doses were to be reduced
for a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as a
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, grade 4 thrombo-

BMS-275291 in HIV-related KS/Brinker et al.

cytopenia, or recurrent grade 4 granulocytopenia or
hemoglobin <8 g/dL while receiving growth factor
support. For subjects enrolled on level I, the dose
could be de-escalated to level 0 (600 mg/day).
The decision to escalate the dose to the next
level, or to expand the number of patients in a given
cohort, was to be based on the number of DLTs, the
number of objective tumor responses, and the number of patients whose tumor biopsies demonstrated
a biologic response, as measured by the percent
change in apoptotic cells. The occurrence of DLT in
more than 1 of 6 subjects within the first 28 days of
treatment halted further dose escalation. If fewer
than 2 of 6 subjects demonstrated objective tumor
responses or fewer than 5 of 6 subjects demonstrated
a biologic response, the dose level was considered
ineffective. If there was evidence for efficacy at level
I, additional patients would be entered at level 0.
Treatment was discontinued for progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. With this study design,
the probability of terminating the study due to toxicity was .89 if the underlying rate of a DLT was .50.

Schedule of Events
Baseline assessments included a history and physical
examination, a complete blood count with differential, serum chemistries, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. Blood tests were repeated
every 2 weeks for 3 months, and then every 4 weeks
for 6 months. CD4 counts and HIV-1 plasma RNA
levels were measured before treatment, on Day 29,
and every 3 months thereafter. A chest X-ray was
performed at baseline and 30 days after the last
treatment. Additional tests to evaluate visceral KS
were performed as required.
Biologic Studies
Punch biopsies (4-mm) of KS lesions were obtained
from nonindicator lesions at baseline and on Day 29.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned for morphologic examination and immunohistochemistry for KSHV LANA (ORF73) as reported
previously.23 A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
was used for in situ detection of apoptosis at the single cell level24 using the DermaTACS kit from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). The total number of
apoptotic cells was counted in the spindle cells in
the dermis (excluding keratinocytes) in a single 5-lM
thick section of the 4-mm biopsy. Apoptotic keratinocytes served as an internal control to ensure nucleic
acid integrity. Cases in which no apoptotic keratinocytes were identified in spite of 3 independent
TUNEL assays were considered noninformative.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used in this study. The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate
changes from baseline in CD4 count. Toxicity was
assessed using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). Tumor assessments were performed at
baseline, on Days 15 and 29 of treatment, and every
28 days thereafter. Tumor assessments were based
on measurements of 5 cutaneous marker lesions and
on the overall number and characteristics of cutaneous lesions. Response to treatment was assessed
according to previously described criteria.25

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Sixteen patients from 8 participating AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) sites were enrolled in the
study between June 26, 2001, and July 25, 2002. One
patient never received study treatment and was
excluded from all analyses. Baseline characteristics
are shown in Table 1. All participants were male,
with a median age of 40.9 years and a median CD4
count of 263 cells/lL. Six patients (40%) were receiving HAART, 5 (33.3%) had 50 cutaneous lesions, 3
(20%) had tumor-associated edema, and none had
visceral disease. All but 1 patient had previously
received treatment for KS (Table 2).
The first 6 subjects were enrolled on dose level I
(1200 mg once a day). Because no DLTs developed
during the first 28 days of treatment, the next 7
patients were enrolled on dose level II (600 mg twice
daily). Because DLT was observed in 3 patients at
this dose level, the next 2 patients were enrolled on

dose level I. Based on the prospectively defined parameters, the trial was stopped due to the number of
DLTs at dose level II and the documentation of only
1 response at dose level I.

Toxicity
Subjects treated at level I were found to have no
grade 3 toxicity during the first 4 weeks of treatment.
Three subjects who received divided-dose treatment
(level II) experienced DLTs: grade 3 fatigue, grade 3
allergic reaction (including fevers), and grade 3
arthralgias in 1 patient each. No grade 4 toxicities
were reported. Neither HAART treatment nor baseline CD4 counts was found to be correlated with the
development of DLTs.
One study subject died during treatment with
BMS-275291. The death was accidental and unrelated
to HIV infection, KS, or study treatment.
Few laboratory abnormalities were observed.
Grade 3 toxicities at level I included thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase levels in 1 patient
each. Grade 3 toxicities at level II included granulocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia in 1 patient each.
No grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported.
Effects on CD4 1 T-cell Counts
Eleven patients had paired baseline and Day 29 CD4
T-cell counts. The median change was 26 (range,
2262 to 230) (P 5 .814). Insufficient numbers of
patients had paired baseline and on-study measurements of HIV RNA levels with which to reach meaningful conclusions regarding the effects on viral load.

Response to Therapy
Of the 16 study subjects, 1 (Patient 12) never
received study drug and 1 patient received <4 weeks
of treatment, leaving 14 subjects whose KS response
could be evaluated (Table 3). Three of 14 patients
(21%) achieved a partial response, 1 of whom was
treated with single-dose 1200 mg/day and 2 of whom
were treated with 600 mg twice daily. The median
duration of response was 9 months (range, 6–12
months). Eleven of 14 patients (73%) had stable disease, with median treatment duration of 3 months
(range, 2–12 months). The median treatment duration for all patients was 5 months (range, <1–12
months). Six patients remained on therapy at the
time of study closure, after a median treatment duration of 7 months (range, 4–12 months).
Effects on Apoptosis
Of 28 biopsies evaluated using the TUNEL assay, 17
were informative. The average number of apoptotic
cells in pretreatment biopsies was 7, and in Day 29
biopsies it was 5.5. Five patients had paired informative biopsies: 1 patient (Patient 6, whose best
response was stable disease) demonstrated a
decrease from 18 to 4 apoptotic cells; 2 patients
(Patients 4 and 11, with stable disease and a partial

BMS-275291 in HIV-related KS/Brinker et al.

response, respectively) demonstrated an increase in
the number of apoptotic cells from 5 to 15 and from
2 to 6, respectively; and 2 patients (Patients 1 and 2,
with partial response and stable disease, respectively)
were found to have no change, and had 1 to 3 apoptotic cells in both Day 0 and 29 biopsies. Thus,
there was no correlation noted between the absolute
number or change in the number of apoptotic cells
and response to therapy.

DISCUSSION
MMPs have been implicated in the progression of
malignant disease, and their overexpression has been
correlated with tumor progression and disease recurrence in several cancer types.26–28 Although MMP
inhibitors reduced tumor size and metastasis in animal models,20,21 they have rarely induced regression
of advanced cancers in humans.29–32 However,
because of their potential effects on tumor vasculature and metastasis, MMPIs are being evaluated as
maintenance therapy and for treatment of relatively
indolent malignancies.
In the current study, 15 patients were treated
with BMS-275291 at a dose of 1200 mg/day, administered either as a single dose (level I) or a divided
dose of 600 mg twice daily (level II). Only 1 objective
response was noted at level I, a dosage associated
with acceptable toxicity, whereas 2 objective responses were documented among patients enrolled
on dose level II, which proved unacceptably toxic.
Therefore, the study was closed based on predetermined criteria. The reason for the increased toxicity
observed when the same total daily dose was given
in divided doses is unknown; the significance of this
finding is difficult to interpret given the small number
of patients treated, and may have occurred by chance.
Hepatic and hematologic toxicities were the
major laboratory toxicities observed, and may have
been related to the underlying HIV infection or its
treatment. In other studies, the toxicity profile for
this agent has been inconsistent. In a phase 1
trial, no DLT was observed in 40 healthy volunteers at doses ranging from 150 to 1200 mg/day
for 14 days.33 In a phase 1 trial in 44 patients with
advanced cancers, DLTs were observed at a dose
of 600 mg/day (grade 3 transaminase elevation)
and 1200 mg/day (grade 3 rash and grade 4 shortness of breath), but were not observed in patients
treated at doses of 900 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, or
2400 mg/day.22
Severe adverse clinical events in this trial
included fatigue, an allergic reaction, and arthralgias.
Dose-limiting polyarthritis, a well-recognized toxicity
of early-generation peptidomimetic MMPIs, was not

1087

observed in this study, nor was it observed in a study
of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer
who received BMS-275291 doses of 1200 mg once or
twice daily.32 Although the lack of polyarthritis was
presumed to be a consequence of BMS-275291’s
nonpeptidomimetic structure and its increased specificity for selected MMPs, transient grade 1 and 2 myalgia/arthralgias were the most frequently reported
adverse events among 44 patients with advanced
cancers treated in a phase 1 trial22 and grade 2
arthralgia was reported in 32% of women with earlystage breast cancer treated with BMS-275291, compared with only 16.7% of subjects who received placebo.34
Although the objective response rate of HIVassociated KS to BMS-275291 in this trial was low (3
of 14 patients; 21%), 11 patients were found to have
stable disease that had persisted for 4 months, 8
months, 10 months, and 10 months, respectively, in
4 patients who remained on treatment at the time of
study closure. Long-term stable disease in patients
with early KS might provide clinical benefit, but
seeking evidence of such an effect would require
extensive resources, particularly in a disease that often has a long natural history. Nonetheless, BMS275251 was apparently less active than another
MMPI, COL-3, which induced objective responses,
including some complete responses, in 41% of KS
patients treated at a dose of 50 mg/day.35
Unfortunately, apoptotic activity in KS biopsies
could not be reliably quantified in a subset of biopsies, most likely due to nucleic acid degradation or
tissue overfixation, and in those cases in which it
could be reliably quantified, no predictive value was
found. Thus, we could not validate apoptosis as an
alternative to standard phase 1 endpoints as a criterion for dose modification. Established biologic endpoints to test the efficacy of antiangiogenic agents
are lacking, but their identification would allow more
rapid and accurate clinical evaluation of biologic
agents. Alternative strategies aimed at gaining a better understanding of KS biology and identifying reliable surrogate endpoints for response are being
evaluated in ongoing AMC trials.
