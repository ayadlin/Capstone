Abstract
Agents targeting insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), including antibodies and small-molecule
inhibitors, are currently in clinical development for the treatment of cancers including sarcoma. However,
development of resistance is a common phenomenon resulting in failures of anticancer therapies. In light of this
problem, we developed two resistant models from the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh41: Rh41-807R, with
acquired resistance to BMS-754807, a small-molecule dual-kinase inhibitor targeting IGF-IR and insulin receptor
(IR), and Rh41-MAB391R, with resistance to MAB391, an IGF-IR–blocking antibody. In addition, tumor xenograft
models were established from Rh41 and Rh41-807R cell lines. Gene expression and DNA copy number analyses of
these models revealed shared as well as unique acquired resistance mechanisms for the two types of IGF-IR
inhibitors. Each resistant model used different signaling pathways as a mechanism for proliferation. Plateletderived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) was amplified, overexpressed, and constitutively activated in
Rh41-807R cells and tumors. Knockdown of PDGFRα by small interfering RNA in Rh41-807R resensitized the
cells to BMS-754807. Synergistic activities were observed when BMS-754807 was combined with PDGFRα inhibitors in the Rh41-807R model in vitro. In contrast, AXL expression was highly elevated in Rh41-MAB391R but
downregulated in Rh41-807R. Notably, BMS-754807 was active in Rh41-MAB391R cells and able to overcome
resistance to MAB391, but MAB391 was not active in Rh41-807R cells, suggesting potentially broader clinical
activity of BMS-754807. This is the first study to define and compare acquired resistance mechanisms for
IGF-IR–targeted therapies. It provides insights into the differential acquired resistance mechanisms for
IGF-IR/IR small-molecule inhibitor versus anti–IGF-IR antibody. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7221–31. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Activation of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)
signaling contributes to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis,
metastasis, and resistance to anticancer therapies in many
human malignancies (1), supporting the IGF system as an
attractive therapeutic target. The IGF system consists of
closely related receptors, the type I and type II IGF receptors
(IGF-IR and IGF-IIR), two insulin receptor (IR) isoforms (IR-A
and IR-B), three ligands (IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin), and
several IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP1–IGFBP6). IGF-IR/IR

hybrid receptors have recently been implicated in cancer
and are activated by IGF-I and IGF-II with signals similar
to the IGF-IR homoreceptors (2–4). IR plays an important
role in regulating IGF action and contributes to resistance
against IGF-IR–targeted therapies (5). Inhibition of both
IGF-IR and IR may be necessary to completely disrupt the
malignant phenotype regulated by this signaling pathway
(6). The IGF system is becoming one of the most intensively
investigated molecular targets in oncology. Currently, there
are close to 30 drug candidates targeting the IGF-IR or
IGF-IR/IR by antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI),
and a number of them are in clinical trials (7–9).
BMS-754807 is a potent and reversible small-molecule TKI of
the IGF-IR/IR family kinases having a wide spectrum of antitumor efficacy (10). Targeting IGF-IR/IR signaling with BMS-754807
has resulted in cancer cell growth inhibition both in vitro and
in vivo. This drug is currently in phase I development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers; preclinically defined efficacious exposures have been achieved with p.o. administration of
single, tolerable doses in humans (11), and effects of BMS-754807
on pharmacodynamic biomarkers have been observed in cancer
patients (12). Ongoing clinical studies with BMS-754807 will soon
provide data on its antitumor activity in cancer patients.

As seen for other cancer drugs, tumors may have the
potential to develop resistance to both IGF-IR antibodies
and small-molecule inhibitors. There are two fundamental
forms of drug resistance: de novo resistance, which refers
to the failure to respond to the initial treatment of a drug,
and acquired resistance, which refers to the relapse of drug
treatment after an initial response. The mechanisms of
acquired drug resistance are studied by two strategies: one
is the molecular analysis of clinical specimens from patients
who initially had benefit to treatment but then relapsed on
the drug, and another is through in vitro cell culture modeling. The latter involves culturing drug-sensitive tumorderived cell lines in increasing concentrations of the drug
until most cells are eliminated and the cultures are eventually enriched with drug-resistant cell populations. The
resistant cell lines can then be characterized by genomic
approaches to identify resistance mechanisms (13, 14).
To assess the mechanisms of acquired resistance to IGFIR–targeted therapies, such as TKIs and IGF-IR–blocking
antibodies, we used the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh41,
which only expresses IGF-IR but no detectable IR, to develop
two cell lines. Rh41-807R is resistant to BMS-754807, and
Rh41-MAB391R is resistant to MAB391, an IGF-IR neutralizing antibody that competes with IGF-I binding to IGF-IR
and can efficiently reduce IGF-IR level by receptor internalization/degradation, reduce phospho (p)-IGF-IR and pAKT in
tumor cells (15), and inhibit proliferation of Rh41 (10). Gene
expression profiling and DNA copy number analysis were
performed on the Rh41, Rh41-807R, and Rh41-MAB391R cell
lines to identify the molecular basis underlying the shared
mechanisms of acquired resistance to both BMS-754807
and MAB391 as well as unique resistance mechanisms to
either drug. This report is the first to define and compare
resistance mechanisms for the IGF-IR/IR TKI BMS-754807
and the anti–IGF-IR antibody MAB391. The results provide
insights into the differentiation of IGF-IR–targeted therapies
and potential strategies toward the reversal or prevention of
resistance.

Materials and Methods
Establishment of resistant cell lines to IGF-IR inhibitors
The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh41 was provided
by Dr. Lee Helman (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD),
grown in the medium described previously (16) and tested by
SNP 6.0 array analysis for authentication. To develop cells
with acquired resistance to either BMS-754807 or MAB391
(R&D Systems, Inc.), Rh41 cells were initially exposed to each
drug at their corresponding IC50 concentration and then at
gradually increasing concentrations of every other culture
passage. The IC50 values of the cells to the drugs were determined periodically during this treatment time until the resistance level reached a plateau.
In vitro cellular proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation after exposure to either BMS-754807 or MAB391
for 72 hours as described previously (10).

Gene expression profiling
RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy kits from Qiagen
to generate gene expression data using Affymetrix HTHG-U133A GeneChip (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray data were analyzed by
ANOVA using Partek to identify genes differentially
expressed between resistant and sensitive cell lines.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR)
The TaqMan gene expression assay reagents for IGF-IR,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), and β-actin
genes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The
assays were performed according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The mRNA expression level was normalized to
β-actin expression.
Gene copy analysis
DNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells using the DNeasy
blood and tissue kit from Qiagen. Two aliquots of 250 ng
of genomic DNA per sample were digested by NspI and
StyI restriction enzymes, respectively. The resulting products were ligated to the corresponding adaptors and
PCR amplified. The labeled PCR products were hybridized
to the Human SNP 6.0 array according to the Affymetrix
recommendations. The Cel files were processed using an
aroma.affymetrix package (17) in the R project. Segmentation of normalized raw copy number data was performed
with the CBS algorithm (18) implemented in the aroma.
affymetrix package. Copy number gain (or loss) of a gene
was obtained by using the maximum (or minimum) of segmented copy number values within the genomic region of
the gene.
Western blot analyses
Antibodies against pIGF-IR/pIR, pAKT, phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and PDGFRα
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Total IGFIR and β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
and Chemicon International, respectively. Cell or tumor
lysates were analyzed as previously described (10). The signal
intensity was scanned and quantified.
Flow cytometry for IGF-IR expression
Rh41-MAB391R cells were seeded in six-well plates in
duplicate with or without 3 nmol/L MAB391 and cultured
overnight. The medium was removed, and fresh medium
without the MAB391 was added. Cells were collected at 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 16, and 24 hours after washout, stained with IGF-IR
antibody (Becton Dickinson), and analyzed by FACScan
(FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson).
Small interfering RNA
Rh41 and Rh41-807R cell transfections were carried out
using ON-TARGETplus small interfering RNA (siRNA) to
human PDGFRα (Dharmacon) with DharmaFECT transfection reagents and Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) according
to the DharmaFECT General Transfection Protocol. RISC-free

Acquired Resistance Mechanisms for IGF-IR Inhibitors

siRNA (Dharmacon) was transfected into cells as the negative control. After the addition of the drug, cells were incubated at 37°C for 72 hours, then cell proliferation was
measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation.
In vivo xenografts
Mice were given a subcutaneous implant of a tumor fragment (∼20 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed
to grow to the predetermined size window (150–175 mg).
The mice were then randomized to receive either vehicle
or BMS-754807 at 50 mg/kg for 14 days (eight mice per
group). Tumor volume and body weight were measured to
assess tumor growth inhibition as described previously (10).

Results
Rh41-807R is cross-resistant to other IGF-IR
inhibitors including MAB391, but Rh41-MAB391R
is still sensitive to BMS-754807
The Rh41 cell line was chosen for induction of acquired
resistance because it expresses IGF-IR (16), the target of both
BMS-754807 and MAB391, and is sensitive to both drugs (10).
Using stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of
either BMS-754807 (∼5 months) or MAB391 (∼3 months),
the cell lines with acquired resistance to either agent were
developed and designated as Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R,
respectively. Because the highest BMS-754807 concentration
used to develop Rh41-807R was 600 nmol/L, which is 120-fold
higher than the IC50 of BMS-754807 for Rh41, the drug at this
dose level could potentially have activities against other
kinases, such as Met, TrkA, and TrkB (10). Isolation of resistant, single-cell clones was not feasible because Rh41 cells
grow poorly at low densities; therefore, resistant cell lines
(Rh41-807R or Rh41-MAB391R) represented pooled populations. No significant differences were seen between in vitro
growth rates in these cell lines (Fig. 1A).
Cell proliferation studies were conducted to compare the
sensitivity of these cell lines. The parental Rh41 cells were
sensitive to both BMS-754807 (IC 50 = 5 nmol/L) and
MAB391 (IC50 = 0.1 nmol/L); Rh41-807R cells had nearly a
162-fold increase in IC50 in response to BMS-754807, and
Rh41-MAB391R cells had a >10,000-fold increase in IC50 in
response to MAB391 (Table 1). Furthermore, when Rh41807R cells were out of drug selection for a period of 3 months
(Rh41-807Rout), they still displayed resistance to BMS754807 with an IC 50 of 465 nmol/L, suggesting that the
resistance of Rh41-807R to BMS-754807 was persistent.
Intriguingly, BMS-754807 was active against Rh41MAB391R cells, whereas MAB391 was unable to inhibit the
growth of either Rh41-MAB391R or Rh41-807R even at a concentration of >2 μmol/L (Table 1). In addition, Rh41-807R
showed cross-resistance to other multiple IGF-IR/IR TKIs;
however, Rh41-MAB391R displayed sensitivity to these drugs
(Table 1). These results suggest that there may be distinct
mechanisms of resistance to BMS-754807 and MAB391.
When Rh41-807R was tested against inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family kinases or MET
kinase, it retained similar response levels as the parental

www.aacrjournals.org

Rh41 cells to these targeted agents (data not shown). In
addition, when Rh41-807R was tested against multiple
cytotoxic agents as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, the cells maintained a very similar level of
sensitivity as the Rh41 cell line (Supplementary Table S1),
suggesting that Rh41-807R was specifically resistant to
IGF-IR inhibitors and the mechanism of resistance to
IGF-IR inhibitors did not affect the responsiveness to cytotoxic agents.
IGF-IR expression and activity contributes to acquired
resistance to IGF-IR inhibition
Because both BMS-754807 and MAB391 target IGF-IR,
we investigated whether changes in IGF-IR expression and
pathway activity are involved in the development of acquired
resistance. Compared with the sensitive Rh41 cells, similar
IGF-IR RNA and protein expression levels were maintained
in Rh41-MAB391R cells, but downregulated levels were found
in Rh41-807R cells (Fig. 1B). IR is not expressed in all cell lines
and may not contribute to the resistance to either BMS-754807
or MAB391. Although RNA expression levels of IGF-IIR and
IGF-II were downregulated in Rh41-807R cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1), IGF-IIR protein levels seem to be similar in all cell lines
(Fig. 1B). Interestingly, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)
protein was also downregulated in Rh41-807R (Fig. 1B).
In Rh41-MAB391R cells, IGF-IR protein decreased in the
presence of MAB391; both total (Fig. 1C) and cell surface
protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2) began to recover
2 hours after removal of MAB391 and returned to normal
level by 24 hours. However, for Rh41-807R cells, both IGFIR RNA and protein did not return to control levels after
removal of BMS-754807 for even 3 months (Rh41-807Rout
in Fig. 1B). BMS-754807 may cause transcriptional regulation
of IGF-IR, whereas MAB391 induces IGF-IR internalization/
degradation (15), leading to a subsequent decrease in IGFIR cell surface expression in Rh41-MAB391R cells. The rapid
restoration of IGF-IR protein level after MAB391 removal
may then be a consequence of the unchanged levels of
RNA, which is continuously available for translation.
We also investigated whether there is any difference in
IGF-IR phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways such as pAKT and pERK in response to
IGF-I stimulation between Rh41, Rh41-MAB391R, and Rh41807R cell lines (Fig. 1D). In the absence of IGF-I, all cell lines
showed low to undetectable pIGF-IR activity, but all responded to IGF-I stimulation by showing an increase in
pIGF-IR, pAKT, and pERK. Quantitative analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 1D) showed that Rh41-807R had much
higher fold increases in the IGF-I–stimulated versus nonstimulated pIGF-IR/IGF-IR ratio (21.4-fold) than Rh41 (9.7-fold),
whereas Rh41-MAB391R only had 4.7-fold, which was lower
than that of Rh41. Both Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R cells
had higher basal levels of pERK/ERK ratio than Rh41 cells,
indicating higher basal activation of signaling in resistant
models. Both resistant cell lines had similar increases in pERK
and pAKT than the parental cells in response to IGF-I stimulation, suggesting no significant difference in AKT and ERK
activation through IGF signaling in both resistant cell lines.

and downregulated) and the other list included genes differentially expressed in Rh41-MAB391R versus parental Rh41.
Comparison of these two gene lists (Fig. 2A) identified three
groups of genes.
The first group of genes with a similar expression pattern
in both Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R (sections A and D of
Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Table S2) may contribute to
shared mechanisms of acquired resistance to agents targeting IGF-IR. These genes are involved in cell signaling
pathways (e.g., FGF9, PDGFRα, and DUSP13), cell matrix
interactions (e.g., MMP2, MMP3, and TIMP3), cell cycle regulation (e.g., DCX, PLAU, AMACR, and MXI1), and apoptosis
(e.g., PAWR, PAX3, and TMSB4X). Compared with sensitive
Rh41 cells, MMP2, TIMP3, and FGF9 were upregulated,
whereas SNRPN, TFAP2B, MMP3, and PLAU were downregulated, in both Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R cells.
The second group of genes had opposite expression
changes between Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R cells (sections B and C of Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Table S3).
Genes such as AXL, FADS3, MME, NNMT, and PLXNC1 were
upregulated in Rh41-MAB391R but downregulated in Rh41807R, whereas MYOZ2, EPHA3, and CDH2 genes had converse
patterns.
The third group of genes showed expression changes only
in one resistant model (genes in sections E and F or G and H
of Fig. 2A). For example, DLK1 was upregulated whereas
TUSC3 and VCAN were downregulated only in Rh41MAB391R, but there were no changes observed in Rh41807R (Supplementary Fig. S4A). FHL1, EEF1A2, PRRX, and
GHR were upregulated whereas INSIG1, CCND1, CCND2,
and ERBB3 were downregulated in Rh41-807R only (Supplementary Fig. S4B and C).
Genes in the latter two groups may contribute to distinct
resistance mechanisms between BMS-754807 and MAB391.
Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed for the genes
that were uniquely overexpressed in either Rh41-807R (sec-

www.aacrjournals.org

tions C and E of Fig. 2A) or Rh41-MAB391R cells (sections
B and G of Fig. 2A). Biological functions and canonical signaling pathways of the two gene lists involved were then
cross-compared. The top 10 are shown in Supplementary
Fig. S5. Although these two gene lists are made up of different genes, their contributions to the same molecular and cellular functions were very similar, whereas the canonical
pathways these genes were involved in were significantly
different. For example, the genes overexpressed in Rh41807R had higher contribution to the IR and IGF-I, PTEN,
PDGF, or EGF signaling pathways, suggesting that these
canonical pathways may contribute to differential resistance
to BMS-754807.
Overall, expression patterns were similar in both Rh41807R and Rh41-807Rout (Fig. 2B). Only a limited number of
genes in Rh41-807Rout had their expression restored to the
levels similar to parental Rh41 cells, suggesting that gene expression patterns in Rh41-807R persisted even after the drugs
were removed.
DNA copy number changes are associated with
acquired resistance to BMS-754807 or MAB391
Whole-genome DNA copy number analysis was performed
using SNP chip for genomic abnormalities. Many low-level
copy number changes (gain or loss) were observed in resistant Rh41-807R cells compared with sensitive Rh41 cells,
whereas only a few copy number gains were observed in
Rh41-MAB391R cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A; Supplementary
Table S4). For example, both Rh41 and Rh41-MAB391R had
mostly normal copy numbers on chromosome 4 in the q11q21 region; however, Rh41-807R had genomic abnormalities
in this region (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Rh41-807R harbored
amplification of chr4q11-q12, which contains the c-KIT and
PDGFRα genes, with 1.9- and 3.3-fold gains compared with
Rh41, respectively (Fig. 2C). Gene amplification was consistent with the overexpression of these two genes seen in
Rh41-807R cells (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). Another
interesting observation is that PTEN loss was found in
Rh41-807R compared with Rh41 cells (Supplementary Table
S4), which is consistent with the decreased gene expression
level in Rh41-807R cells (1.8-fold reduction, P = 0.018; expression data not shown).
Rh41-807R and Rh41-MAB391R overexpress unique
genes in alternative signaling pathways mediating
differential resistance mechanisms
Gene expression profiling identified genes in key signaling
pathways that were differentially expressed between Rh41807R and Rh41-MAB391R cells. PDGFRα showed significant
increases of RNA and protein expression in Rh41-807R cells
compared with Rh41 cells; this was not seen in Rh41MAB391R, and the induction of PDGFRα was observed even
in cells out of BMS-754807 selection for 3 months (Fig. 3A).
PDGFRα was constitutively activated in the presence or absence of the ligand PDGFBB in Rh41-807R cells, suggesting
that the activation was ligand independent (Fig. 3B). Although
in sensitive Rh41 cells it was undetectable (Fig. 3A), PDGFRα
RNA level was induced after treatment with BMS-754807 in a

concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C), whereas IGF-IR
levels were unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S8). PDGFRα
induction was an early event and observable at 4 hours after
treatment (Fig. 3C), and the induction was also observed by
treatment with two other IGF-IR small-molecule inhibitors
(data not show). Other genes, such as c-KIT, FGFR2, and
EPHA3, had a similar RNA expression pattern as PDGFRα,
whereas c-KIT protein level was similar in these cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Several Eph receptor family members such as EPHA3, EPHA4, and EPHB2, as well as ligand
EFNA3, were overexpressed in Rh41-807R. A large number
of RAS/RAF-related genes (e.g., ARAF, ARHGAP8, RAB40B,
RAB6B, RAB7L1, RASL11B, RASSF2, RHOC, and RHOQ) were
also upregulated only in Rh41-807R cells (data not shown).

AXL was an interesting example with an opposite expression pattern in resistant models. Its RNA expression level was
7.8-fold higher in Rh41-MAB391R cells but 4.9-fold lower in
Rh41-807R cells compared with the sensitive parental Rh41,
and Western blot analysis further confirmed that AXL protein expression was increased in Rh41-MAB391R (Fig. 3D).
Rh41-807R retains resistance to BMS-754807 in vivo
To test whether Rh41-807R is also resistant to BMS-754807
in vivo, both Rh41 and Rh41-807R xenograft tumors were
established. Rh41 achieved 73% tumor growth inhibition
(TGI) in response to BMS-754807, whereas Rh41-807R had
only 35% TGI, indicating that the resistance was consistent

Acquired Resistance Mechanisms for IGF-IR Inhibitors

Figure 3. A, PDGFRα RNA and protein expression is upregulated in Rh41-807R but not in Rh41-MAB391R, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR and
Western blot, respectively. B, overexpression and constitutive activation of PDGFRα protein in Rh41-807R cells. Cells were starved for 24 h (0.3% bovine
serum albumin) and then stimulated with or without the ligand PDGFBB (PeproTech) for 5 min. Total protein (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated (IP) with
PDGFRα antibody and analyzed on SDS gel. Membrane was immunoblotted (IB) with phosphotyrosine PY20 (BD Biosciences) and total PDGFRα.
C, PDGFRα transcript induction by BMS-754807 in Rh41 cells is an early event and dose dependent. PDGFRα RNA levels were measured by quantitative
RT-PCR and compared with the untreated time 0 control. D, AXL RNA and protein expression is upregulated in Rh41-MAB391R but downregulated in
Rh41-807R cells.

Examination of the expression of IGF-IR and PDGFRα in
these tumors revealed that the reduction in IGF-IR and the
increase in PDGFRα protein expression in Rh41-807R tumors
were retained (Fig. 4B). Rh41-807R tumors also had higher
RNA expression levels of c-KIT, FGFR2, and PDGFRα compared with Rh41 tumors, which is consistent with the pattern
observed in cell lines (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the mechanisms of resistance to BMS-754807 were maintained in vitro
and in vivo. It was noticed that the fold increase of PDGFRα
in Rh41-807R tumors was relatively lower than that in the cell
line. This could be a result of the mice not being treated with
BMS-754807 during the time between tumor implantation
and reaching the predetermined size, and thus it actually
mimicked the Rh41-807Rout situation.
Modulation of PDGFRα activity or expression alters the
response to BMS-754807 in Rh41-807R cells
Because PDGFRα expression was upregulated and constitutively activated in Rh41-807R cells, we tested whether dovitinb, a drug that has activity against PDGFR, is able to
inhibit the growth of the resistant cells. Rh41-807R cells were
more sensitive to dovitinb than Rh41 (Fig. 5A), suggesting

www.aacrjournals.org

that PDGFR may play a role in the resistance to BMS754807. Considering that dovitinb inhibits other kinases such
as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, c-KIT, FGFR,
and FLT (19) and Rh41-807R cells also had increased RNA
expression of c-KIT and FGFR2 (Supplementary Fig. S7) in
addition to PDGFRα, the ability of dovitinib to target multiple kinases may contribute to the increased sensitivity of
Rh41-807R to the compound. We tested several compounds
(axitinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib) that have activity against
PDGFR and observed varying degrees of growth inhibitory
activity in Rh41-807R cells (Supplementary Table S5), again
suggesting that PDGFR is involved in mediating resistance
to BMS-754807.
To further examine the correlation between the overexpression of PDGFRα and the acquisition of BMS-754807
resistance, we suppressed the expression of PDGFRα using
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDGFRα in Rh41-807R cells.
The PDGFRα-specific siRNA was able to efficiently suppress
the expression of PDGFRα (Fig. 5B), whereas it had no effect
on IGF-IR expression (Supplementary Fig. S9). We next studied the effect of PDGFRα suppression on response to BMS754807 using an in vitro cell proliferation assay. Both Rh41

and Rh41-807R cells were transfected with either control
or PDGFRα-specific siRNA, followed by treatment with
different concentrations of BMS-754807 for 72 hours. Rh41
cells were still sensitive to BMS-754807, with no differences
observed in the sensitivity between untransfected, control
siRNA–transfected, and PDGFRα siRNA–transfected cells
(Fig. 5B), probably due to the very low level of PDGFRα
expression (Fig. 3A). Rh41-807R cells transfected with
PDGFRα siRNA restored growth inhibition sensitivity to
BMS-754807 to similar levels as Rh41 cells, whereas control
siRNA–transfected cells were still resistant to BMS-754807
with no change in sensitivity (Fig. 5B). These results provided
evidence that overexpression of PDGFRα confers resistance
to BMS-754807 and that downregulation of PDGFRα in Rh41807R cells restores sensitivity to BMS-754807.
We next tested the effect of combining BMS-754807 with
PDGFR antagonists in Rh41-807R cells. BMS-754807 alone was
not active, and dovitinb, sunitinib, imatinib, or axitinib had
varying degrees of activity in Rh41-807R cells; combinations of
BMS-754807 with any of these PDGFR inhibitors had synergistic
effects on growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S10). This indicated that inhibition of both IGF-IR and PDGFR may be necessary to inhibit the proliferation of cells that had acquired
resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors mediated by PDGFR activation.

Discussion
Multiple resistance mechanisms compromise the successful clinical application of inhibitors targeting oncogenic
tyrosine kinases (13, 14). As both antibodies and TKIs targeting IGF-IR are currently in clinical testing, it is important to
understand the mechanisms of resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors so that rational therapy strategies can be defined to
reverse or prevent resistance. In addition, biomarkers of
resistance will help to identify those tumors more likely to
respond to other specific agents. The aim of this study was
to identify the mechanisms of acquired resistance to IGF-IR–
targeted therapies. To achieve this, cell lines with acquired
resistance to either BMS-754807 or the IGF-IR antibody
MAB391 were developed using Rh41 rhabdomyosarcoma
cancer cells in vitro to compare and define the commonalities and differences in resistance mechanisms between
these agents.
Accumulating evidence suggests that similar molecular
mechanisms could underlie both de novo resistance and
acquired resistance (13, 14). As we previously reported in a
sarcoma cell line panel, the level of IGF-IR expression was
associated with response to IGF-IR inhibitors, and lower expression of IGF-IR was seen in more resistant cell lines (16).

Acquired Resistance Mechanisms for IGF-IR Inhibitors

B, PDGFRα expression knockdown by siRNA regains the sensitivity to BMS-754807 in Rh41-807R cells 72 h after transfection. The average IC50 values and
SD from three independent experiments are shown. C, schematic illustration of acquired resistance mechanisms to BMS-754807. Left, cells with high
expression of IGF-IR and activated pathway show response to BMS-754807, with inhibition of downstream effectors and consequent inhibition of
proliferation. Right, cells with acquired resistance to IGF-IR inhibitor arise through amplification of PDGFRα and, subsequently, kinase activation, which
transduces the overlapped proliferation signals.

This was further confirmed by a recent report that IGF-IR
levels correlated with sensitivity to an anti-IGF-IR–targeting
antibody in breast and colon cell lines (20). In the present
study, we observed that downregulation of IGF-IR in the cells
acquired resistance to BMS-754807 (Fig. 1B) albeit via different mechanisms of action. The mechanism by which BMS754807 causes the chronic loss of IGF-IR expression is an
interesting question, and it could potentially be through
transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. Low
expression of IGF-IR may possibly lead to fewer membrane
receptors, lower IRS-1 levels, and, consequently, less dependence on the IGF pathway for growth; although it still
responds to IGF-I stimulation in signaling (Fig. 1D), it is
much less sensitive to BMS-754807 for proliferation (Table 1)
possibly due to activation of other pathways. This may serve
as one of the resistance mechanisms for both de novo and

www.aacrjournals.org

acquired resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors. In addition, there is
a possibility that IGF-IR gene mutations evolved during the
process of acquiring resistance, which could be monitored in
a clinical setting.
Genetic alterations that lead to overexpression or altered
function of gene products in tumors have been implicated in
drug resistance (13). This includes an acquisition of additional
copies of specific genes and/or induction of alternative
receptor signaling molecules resulting in a switch to other
signaling pathway dependencies in the acquired resistance
to TKIs. One example of this switch is the amplification
or the induction of MET kinase in non–small cell lung cancer
patients or cells with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy (21, 22). We found DNA copy number gains in Rh41-807R
cells in chr4q11-q12, where PDGFRα and c-KIT are located
(Fig. 2C). Overexpression of PDGFRα seems to precede

amplification of the gene. Induction of PDGFRα RNA in Rh41
cells was an early event and seen at 4 hours after BMS-754807
treatment (Fig. 3C). The overexpression of PDGFRα in Rh41807R (Fig. 3A) and the ability of PDGFRα siRNA to restore
BMS-754807 sensitivity in Rh41-807R cells (Fig. 5B) provide
strong evidence that PDGFRα is involved in resistance to
BMS-754807 in this model system. PDGFRα amplification
in tumors has been previously reported, especially in glioblastomas and sarcoma (23, 24), but its role in drug resistance has not been previously described. This is the first
study linking the amplification/overexpression of PDGFRα
with resistance to targeted inhibitors.
The enhancement of tumor cell proliferation and the
induction of resistance to therapy via cross-talk between
the IGF-IR and PDGFR pathways are not fully understood.
There are overlaps in a common set of downstream
effectors of IGF-IR and PDGFRα signaling. These consist
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
signaling molecules, which are integrators of growth signals
originating from IGF-IR or PDGFRα. We hypothesize
(Fig. 5C) that, in the sensitive Rh41 cells, IGF-IR is the predominant driver for proliferation via activation of AKT and
ERK, making it sensitive to BMS-754807 inhibition, whereas
in Rh41-807R cells, gene overexpression/amplification of the
alternate receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFRα leads to its
activation, resulting in an increase in proliferation signals
through cross-talk between the two pathways. Although
targeting IGF-IR still inhibits IGF-IR activation, it does
not sufficiently affect the downstream pathways. Inactivation of common proteins that are key transmitters in the
IGF-IR and PDGFRα signaling pathways is required to interrupt growth signaling. The combined targeting of these
two redundant signaling pathways achieves enhanced inhibition of tumor cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S10). Strategies including combination treatments and biomarker
development should be further considered when developing
targeted agents to prevent or delay the occurrence of
acquired resistance.
We observed an overexpression of AXL in Rh41-MAB391R
cells but not in Rh41-807R cells (Fig. 3D). The reason for this
difference remains unclear. Recent studies reported that
increased expression of AXL may confer acquired resistance
to imatinib in gastrointestinal tumors (25), to lapatinib in
breast tumor cells (26), and to chemotherapy drugs in
acute myeloid leukemia (27).

It is difficult to predict differences in efficacy between antireceptor antibodies and TKIs due to the disparity in selectivity (28). This has been addressed by comparing erlotinib
and cetuximab for targeting EGFR or lapatinib and trastuzumab for targeting HER2 (29). Data from our study indicate
that the mechanisms of resistance to BMS-754807 differ from
that of the IGF-IR antibody MAB391. Cells that developed
resistance to BMS-754807 are cross-resistant to other IGFIR inhibitors including the anti–IGF-IR antibody MAB391,
but cell lines resistant to MAB391 are still sensitive to
BMS-754807 (Table 1). This suggests that there could be
activity for BMS-754807 in a broader spectrum of tumors, including those that are resistant to IGF-IR antibodies. Patients
who fail treatment with IGF-IR antibody therapies may still
benefit from BMS-754807 treatment, as it has a wider spectrum against the IGF-IR/IR family and, therefore, may be more
effective in inhibiting signaling through both IGF-IR and IR.
In summary, this study offers the first definition and
comparison of acquired resistance mechanisms between
the TKI BMS-754807 and an antibody against IGF-IR in a
human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh41 cells. Acquired resistance
to BMS-754807 was associated with increased expression of
PDGFRα, whereas resistance to the IGF-IR antibody MAB391
was associated with overexpression of AXL in this model.
These molecular changes could serve as biomarkers for the
identification of resistant tumors in clinical use. The molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors
identified in this study may provide a basis for the rational
development of next-generation inhibitors, as well as of
effective drug combinations that can overcome or prevent
acquired resistance to the inhibitors, thereby enhancing
clinical benefit.
