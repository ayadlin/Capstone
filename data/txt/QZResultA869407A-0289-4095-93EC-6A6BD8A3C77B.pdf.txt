ABSTRACT:
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential molecular chaperone in eukaryotes
that facilitates the conformational maturation and function of a diverse protein
clientele, including aberrant and/or over-expressed proteins that are involved in
cancer growth and survival. A role for Hsp90 in supporting the protein homeostasis
of cancer cells has buoyed interest in the utility of Hsp90 inhibitors as anti-cancer
drugs. Despite the fact that all clinically evaluated Hsp90 inhibitors target an identical
nucleotide-binding pocket in the N domain of the chaperone, the precise determinants
that affect drug binding in the cellular environment remain unclear, and it is possible
that chemically distinct inhibitors may not share similar binding preferences. Here
we demonstrate that two chemically unrelated Hsp90 inhibitors, the benzoquinone
ansamycin geldanamycin and the purine analog PU-H71, select for overlapping but not
identical subpopulations of total cellular Hsp90, even though both inhibitors bind to an
amino terminal nucleotide pocket and prevent N domain dimerization. Our data also
suggest that PU-H71 is able to access a broader range of N domain undimerized Hsp90
conformations than is geldanamycin and is less affected by Hsp90 phosphorylation,
consistent with its broader and more potent anti-tumor activity. A more complete
understanding of the impact of the cellular milieu on small molecule inhibitor binding
to Hsp90 should facilitate their more effective use in the clinic.

INTRODUCTION

a greater dependence on Hsp90 and other components of
the cellular homeostatic machinery. As a result, Hsp90 has
become an attractive target for cancer therapy and there
are currently 17 chemically distinct Hsp90 inhibitors being
evaluated in cancer clinical trials [3]. Promising data from
trials evaluating Hsp90 inhibitors have been reported for

chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) to maintain
protein homeostasis [1-2]. Because of their genetic

several cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and
HER2+ breast cancer [4-7].
Hsp90 is a dimer formed from two identical
protomers. Each protomer contains three domains: an
amino-terminal (N) domain that contains a nucleotide
binding pocket shared by ATP and inhibitory drugs,
and several co-chaperone (proteins regulating Hsp90
function)-interacting motifs; a middle (M) domain that
harbors sites for client interaction and additional cochaperone binding motifs, and a carboxy-terminal (C)
domain that contains a dimerization motif and interaction
sites for additional co-chaperones. Upon ATP binding
to the N domain, Hsp90 undergoes an ordered series of
conformational changes, termed the chaperone cycle, that
begin with transient dimerization of the N domains to
confer ATPase competence. Coupled with ATP hydrolysis
and with the assistance of defined co-chaperones, this
chaperone cycle allows Hsp90 to modify client protein
conformation/stability [8-10]. Hsp90 inhibitors interfere
with this cycle at its early stages by replacing ATP, leading
to the regulated ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated

degradation of most client proteins [11].
Accumulating evidence suggests that, despite
targeting an identical binding site, chemically distinct
Hsp90 inhibitors may preferentially recognize and trap
various conformational states of the chaperone [12].
While recent analyses utilizing in vitro reconstituted
systems have shed light on several aspects of Hsp90inhibitor interaction, such studies do not recapitulate the
presentation of Hsp90 in the human cancer cell, including
the potentially complex impact of the chaperone’s
numerous and dynamic posttranslational modifications on
drug binding[13-20].
To begin to better understand these parameters, we
have investigated the impact of the cellular milieu on the
binding preferences and consequences of two chemically
unrelated Hsp90 inhibitors, the benzoquinone ansamycin
geldanamycin (GA) and the purine analog PU-H71
(PU). Further, we queried the ability of these inhibitors
to access similar Hsp90 conformational states. Our
data suggest that PU samples a more diverse repertoire
of Hsp90 conformations compared to GA, and these

or C-terminal (C) domains

differences are amplified in a cellular context. However,
both inhibitors prevent the N domain dimerization that
is necessary for a productive chaperone cycle. We also
find that inhibitor binding is not uniformly affected by
Hsp90 phosphorylation. These data suggest that additional
posttranslational modifications may differentially affect
drug binding and influence their cellular Hsp90 inhibitory
activity in ways not predicted by in vitro analysis.

After initial affinity pulldown of purified recombinant
Hsp90 protein with drug-bound agarose, we incubated
samples with increasing concentrations of trypsin and
we visualized the resultant protein fragments by Western
blotting with Hsp90 antibodies recognizing either N- or
C-terminal epitopes. We found that PU-bound Hsp90
displayed somewhat greater resistance to trypsin than
did the GA-bound protein (Figure 1F). To test whether
a similar pattern existed in vivo, we used drug beads to
affinity capture Hsp90 from SkBr3 cell lysate (Figure
1G). PU-bound Hsp90 was markedly more protected at
both major protease cleavage sites, consistent with a more
compact structure compared to GA-bound Hsp90.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
GA and PU recognize overlapping but not
identical cellular Hsp90 populations

GA and PU trap distinct Hsp90 conformations
but neither drug promotes N domain dimerization

In order to investigate the binding preferences of GA
and PU in cancer cells, we used drug-conjugated agarose
as an investigative tool. Consistent with a recent study
[12], we found that repeated challenge of a tumor cell
protein lysate with GA- or PU-conjugated agarose beads
could not capture the entire Hsp90 population, although
PU-beads were able to capture a larger fraction of Hsp90
compared to GA-beads (Figure 1A). The unbound Hsp90
fraction retained affinity for Hsp90-specific antibody
and ATP-conjugated agarose ([12], and data not shown),
suggesting that although it was not accessible to drugs, this
population of Hsp90 maintained a native conformation.
Repeated challenge of recombinant Hsp90 protein
with drug-beads yielded a qualitatively similar result,
although the discrepancy between GA- and PU-beads was
less apparent (Fig. 1B). To discern whether the Hsp90
populations isolated by each inhibitor were mutually
exclusive, we subjected a tumor cell lysate to several
rounds of GA-agarose followed by several rounds of PUagarose, and vice versa. We found that, after depletion of
the GA-bindable population, there remained a significant
fraction of Hsp90 with affinity for PU (Fig. 1C, top panel).
However, the reverse was not true, suggesting that the GAbindable cellular Hsp90 pool is contained within a more
abundant PU-bindable fraction (Fig. 1C, bottom panel).
When we performed a similar analysis using recombinant
Hsp90 protein, we observed less divergence between
GA-bindable and PU-bindable populations (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that cell-dependent modifications of Hsp90
contribute to this discrepancy. Treatment of whole cells
with excess soluble drug support this interpretation, as
PU-agarose was able to capture Hsp90 not quenched by
soluble GA, but soluble PU completely inhibited Hsp90
interaction with immobilized GA (data not shown).
Different Hsp90 conformations display characteristic
protease sensitivity profiles [21-22]. Therefore, we used
trypsin proteolysis to further investigate the state of
GA- and PU-bound Hsp90. Previously described major
tryptic cleavage sites in the middle (**) and C-terminal
(*) domains of Hsp90 [21-22] are shown in Figure 1E.

Based on measurements using purified proteins,
GA and PU display similar Hsp90 binding efficiencies
(GA Kd = 1.35 µM, PU Kd = 0.78 µM). Therefore, the
disparate binding profiles of GA and PU in cells, shown
in Figure 1, likely are influenced by factors in the cellular
environment. Supporting this hypothesis, a recent study
found that PU-beads readily affinity purify a population
of Hsp90 bound to clients [12], in contrast to GA beads
[23]. We sought to verify this discrepancy by screening
for the presence of well-documented Hsp90 clients in
our pulldown system. Kinases comprise a large part of
the Hsp90 clientele [24] and Hsp90-dependent kinases
are delivered to the chaperone by p50Cdc37, an Hsp90
co-chaperone that maintains Hsp90’s ATP lid in an
open conformation to facilitate client loading [25-28].
Therefore, we investigated the presence of p50Cdc37 in GAand PU-bound Hsp90 populations. This co-chaperone coprecipitated to a much greater degree with PU-bound than
with GA-bound Hsp90 (Figure 2A). Further examination
of affinity captured Hsp90 complexes revealed that PUbound Hsp90 was associated to a much greater degree
than was GA-bound Hsp90 with the client kinases ErbB2
(Figure 2B) and v-Src (Figure 2C). Pre-treatment of intact
cells with radicicol, a chemically unrelated N-terminal
Hsp90 inhibitor that occupies the same nucleotide binding
pocket as does PU (and GA), abrogated both ErbB2 and
v-Src pulldown by PU-beads (Figure 2D, E), confirming
specificity. These data support the likelihood that PU,
in contrast to GA, can access and efficiently trap Hsp90
species bound to p50Cdc37 and client kinases.
Because PU-bound Hsp90 remains associated with
client proteins, we asked whether the drug may allow
some degree of N domain dimerization, which is thought
to confer more avid client binding to Hsp90 [29-30]. First,
in order to visualize N domain dimers of purified Hsp90
we performed cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate
(DMS) in the presence of AMP-PNP (a non-hydrolyzable
ATP analog), ADP, GA or PU, and we assessed N domain
dimerization by Western blot. Only AMP-PNP promoted

significant N domain dimerization (Figure 2F). Averaged
densitometric scans of these results are depicted in Figure
2G, where the arrow identifies the degree of N-terminally
dimerized Hsp90 protein.
To confirm these results, we performed fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis using purified
yeast Hsp90 with FRET probes on the N domain of one
protomer and on the M domain of the other protomer.
N domain dimerization is a prerequisite for FRET to be
generated by the close opposition of these two domains.
As in the previous experiment, only the stable ATP analog
ATPγS induced a FRET signal (Figure 2H). In contrast,
neither GA nor PU was able to do so. Finally, using
fluorescence anisotropy generated by fluorescein-labeled
p23 binding (which requires N domain dimerization [31]),

we found that neither GA nor PU supported p23 binding
to Hsp90, again in contrast to AMP-PNP (Figure 2I) and
consistent with the impact of these drugs on p23 binding
to Hsp90 in cells [23, 32]. This was confirmed by FRET
analysis with donor-labeled p23 and acceptor-labeled
yeast Hsp90, where only after addition of AMP-PNP was
an increase of acceptor fluorescence detectable (data not
shown). These data agree with our earlier observation
that p50Cdc37 was found in PU-bead pulldowns of Hsp90,
since ATP lid closure, which is antagonized by this cochaperone [27], initiates the conformational changes
necessary for N domain dimerization and establishment
of the p23 binding motif [31, 33-34]. Taken together, our
findings definitively show that neither GA nor PU binding
to Hsp90 is compatible with N domain dimerization,

levels before (input, in) and after (final, f) chemical precipitation were monitored by Western blot. PU, but not GA, preferentially associates

correspond to N-terminal dimerization as assayed by FRET. Time-dependent FRET induced by addition of either 2 mM ATPγS (black

binding to yHsp90. Fluorescein-labeled p23 was excited at 490 nM and emission was recorded at 520 nM. p23 binding to Hsp90, which
requires N domain dimerization, is only detectable after addition of 2 mM AMP-PNP (black tracing), but not after addition of 10 µM GA
(green tracing), 10 µM PU (red tracing), or 100 µM PU (blue tracing).

suggesting that the client-interacting Hsp90 species
trapped by PU-beads must be in an ‘open’ (e.g., N domain
undimerized) conformation.
To explore further the range of open Hsp90
conformations accessible by PU and GA, we assessed drug
binding to purified yeast Hsp90 protein engineered with
an N-terminal coiled-coil “clamp” to enforce N domain
proximity (but not N domain dimerization) and to limit the
range of available N domain undimerized conformations
([35], cartoon depicted in Figure 3A). Although our
protease sensitivity data suggested a model in which GA
preferentially traps a more open, extended form of Hsp90
compared to PU, we found that equilibrium binding of
GA to both wild-type (NMC) and coiled-coil (coilNMC)
yeast Hsp90 protein was similar, based on fluorescence
anisotropy of BODIPY-GA (Figure 3B), suggesting that
GA can also access a more compact Hsp90 conformation,
as previously proposed [36]. Further, we found that both
GA- and PU-beads efficiently isolated coiled-coil Hsp90
from yeast lysates, compared to wild-type Hsp90 (Figure
3C, top panel, ‘yHsp90’ blots).
The yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase Slt2/
MPK1, which is involved in cell wall integrity, has been
found associated with Hsp90 only after activation with
10 mM caffeine, presumably because association of the
inactive kinase with Hsp90 is too weak to be detectable
with standard pull-down techniques [37]. Pull-down of
wild-type Hsp90 from yeast lysate confirmed these results
(Figure 3C, bottom panel, left two lanes). In contrast with
these data, PU-beads, but not GA-beads, co-precipitated
detectable amounts of non-activated Slt2/MPK1 with
wild-type Hsp90 from yeast lysate (Figure 3C, top panel,
left two lanes, ‘Slt2/MPK1’ blots), suggesting that as

in mammalian cells PU is able to trap and stabilize a
subpopulation of the open Hsp90 conformation displaying
stronger affinity for weakly interacting Hsp90 client
proteins. Interestingly, coiled-coil Hsp90 also associated
efficiently with non-activated Slt2/MPK1 (Figure 3C,
bottom panel, right two lanes), and both PU-beads
and GA-beads pulled down non-activated Slt2/MPK1
associated with coiled-coil Hsp90 (Figure 3C, top panel,
right two lanes). These findings are consistent with a
model of Hsp90/client interaction in which the compact,
N domain undimerized Hsp90 conformation (stabilized
by the presence of an N domain coiled-coil motif but
normally comprising a minor percentage of the open
wild-type Hsp90 population at steady-state) possesses
unexpected avidity for weakly interacting client proteins,
and this conformation is preferentially accessible to PU
and perhaps to other Hsp90 inhibitors.

Phosphorylation state of Hsp90 contributes to
inhibitor selectivity
While these data suggest that GA or PU binding
preferences depend on the conformational state of
Hsp90, the influence of cellular environment on these
parameters implies that posttranslational modification of
Hsp90 may contribute to inhibitor selectivity [13-20].
Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is one of the
most dynamic regulatory processes in cells and growing
evidence suggests that Hsp90 phosphorylation contributes
to Hsp90 regulation in eukaryotes ([14-17, 20]; also see
Phosphosite Plus website). Thus, we asked whether Hsp90
phosphorylation status affected recognition by GA- or

PU-beads. First, we observed that, in the presence of the
potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bpV(phen),
PU-beads captured tyrosine-phosphorylated Hsp90 with
greater efficiency than did GA-beads (Figure 4A). Next,
using a site-specific phospho-Hsp90 antibody (antipY197, numbering for human Hsp90α [20]), we confirmed
that Hsp90α phosphorylated endogenously on Y197 bound
to PU- but not to GA-beads (Figure 4B). Likewise, when
purified Hsp90α was subjected to in vitro phosphorylation
with purified v-Src protein prior to challenge with GA- or
PU-beads, we observed a similar preference of GA-beads
for non-phosphorylated Hsp90 (Figure 4C).
Since the phosphorylation status of Y197 affects
GA binding more severely than it does PU binding, we
queried the ability of phosphomimetic (Y197E) and nonphosphorylatable (Y197F) Hsp90α mutants to bind to GAand PU-beads. Since this tyrosine residue is conserved in
Hsp90β (Y192), we also examined drug-bead binding to
the equivalent Hsp90β mutants (Y192E and Y192F). In
agreement with our previous data, interaction of either
phosphomimetic mutant (Hsp90α-Y197E or Hsp90βY192E) with GA-beads was undetectable, while GA-

beads bound the non-phosphorylatable mutants (Hsp90αY197F and Hsp90β-Y192F) similarly to wild-type
Hsp90 (Figure 4D). In contrast, binding of PU-beads
to both Hsp90α and Hsp90β was minimally affected by
these mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that the
phosphorylation status of this tyrosine residue may be
an important determinant of GA binding but has minimal
impact on PU binding.
Finally, we examined whether the phosphorylation
status of a second conserved tyrosine (Y301 in Hsp90β
and Y309 in Hsp90α) affected drug binding. Although PU
binding was not influenced by mutation of this residue
in either Hsp90 isoform, phosphomimetic mutation of
this tyrosine in Hsp90β (Y301E) markedly reduced
GA binding. Interestingly, we did not observe similar
effects for Hsp90α, where neither phosphomimetic nor
non-phosphorylatable mutation (Y309E and Y309F,
respectively) altered GA binding (Figure 4E). These
observations suggest that the phosphorylation status of
this residue may provide isoform specificity to GA (but
not PU) binding.
Taken together, our data suggest that, although

isolated with GA or PU beads and Western blotted with antibody to pan-phospho-tyrosine. (B) Endogenous Hsp90 was subjected to GA
and PU beads as in (A) and probed with an antibody specific to phospho-tyrosine 197 (Hsp90α). (C) In vitro v-Src-dependent tyrosine
phosphorylation of Hsp90 bound to either GA or PU beads. (D, E) Phosphorylation can influence both the binding and isoform specificity
of Hsp90 inhibitors. Flag-tagged wild-type and phospho-mimetic mutant Hsp90α and Hsp90β in cell lysates were subjected to GA and PU
beads. Phosphorylation of Y197 (Hsp90α) or Y192 (Hsp90β) reduced GA binding without affecting PU binding (D). Phosphorylation of
Y301 affected GA binding to Hsp90β only; binding of phospho-Y301-Hsp90β to PU, or phospho-Y309-Hsp90α to either GA or PU was
unchanged compared to wild-type (E).

N domain small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors sharing
the same binding pocket and possessing comparable
affinities for Hsp90 similarly inhibit the chaperone cycle
at an early stage, they may preferentially access distinct
populations of the open conformation and are not equally
affected by Hsp90 posttranslational modification. As
proof of principle, we have shown here that PU-H71
accesses a broader range of open Hsp90 conformations
than does geldanamycin and it is less affected by Hsp90
phosphorylation, consistent with its broader and more
potent cellular activity [12]. Importantly, we have shown
also that phosphorylation can provide isoform specificity
to Hsp90 inhibitor binding. Although in vitro reconstituted
systems have provided valuable information concerning
Hsp90 structure and interactions with co-chaperones,
client proteins and N domain inhibitors, such studies
cannot assess the influence of cellular environmental
factors on these parameters, including the potentially
complex impact of the chaperone’s numerous and dynamic
posttranslational modifications on drug binding. As our
current data clearly demonstrate, the cellular milieu
strongly influences these parameters in ways not predicted
by in vitro observations, thus providing an additional level
of complexity to optimal Hsp90 targeting in vivo.

instructions. After incubation for 18 h, cells were lysed
as above and assayed for protein expression and drugconjugated agarose binding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

GA-affinity beads and PU-affinity beads were
synthesized as previously described [39, 42-43]. All
bead conjugates were washed in lysis buffer, added to
200 - 400 µg total protein in 400 µl total volume, and
rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The volume of bead conjugates
used was determined by pilot experiments to insure equal
amounts of Hsp90 precipitated from each cell line used,
and volumes varied between batches of beads. However,
in all experiments, bead volumes were 20 - 40 µl (50%
slurry). Following incubation, bead conjugates were
washed 3 times in lysis buffer and subjected to Western
blot analysis.

Yeast growth and lysis
Yeast strain pp30 (MAT a, trp1-289, leu2-3,112,

hsp82KANMX4) [40] carrying either wild-type Hsp82
(NMC), or Hsp82 with N-terminal coiled-coils (coilNMC)
[35] were used in this study. Yeast were grown on YPD
(2% (wt/vol) Bacto peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose,
20 mg/liter adenine). Selective growth was on dropout 2%
glucose (DO) medium with appropriate amino acids [14].
The medium pH was adjusted to 6.8 with NaOH before
autoclaving. 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA) plates were
prepared as previously described [41]. Yeast lysis was
carried out as previously described [14]. The cell wall
integrity MAP kinase pathway was stimulated by 10 mM
caffeine.

in McCoy’s 5A (SkBr3) or DMEM (293-T, 293-H)
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies). All cell lines were propagated at 37°C
in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After washing in
PBS, adherent cells were lysed in TNES buffer (50 mM
Tris pH7.5, 1% NP40, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl)
with freshly-added protease and/or phosphatase inhibitor

for 6 min and digested fragments were visualized by
immunoblotting with both N- and C-terminal anti-HSP90
antibodies.

Human Hsp90α was N-terminally tagged with
hexahistidine using pRSETA plasmid. 1 mg of bacterially
expressed and purified protein was incubated with 100
µl of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). 200 ng of baculovirus
expressed and purified v-Src (SignalChem) was used, and
kinase reactions were performed as previously described
[45].

BODIPY-GA was synthesized as described [44].
A 100 nM stock was reduced with 15 mM dithiothreitol
in assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM magnesium
chloride, 100 mM potassium chloride, 0.01% Nonidet
P-40) for 1 hour at 4°C in order to convert GA to the highaffinity hydroquinone form. From this stock, samples with
5 nM BODIPY-GA and purified Hsp90 proteins (NMC or
coilNMC) at concentrations ranging from 0-1000 nM were
prepared in assay buffer with 15 mM DTT. These samples
were incubated at 23°C for 1 hour prior to measurement
of fluorescent anisotropy. Anisotropy measurements were
made in a 0.3 cm path length cuvette on a PTI QM-4SE
spectrofluorometer with excitation set to 488 nm and
emission at 510 nm. The apparent Kd was determined by
fitting the anisotropy measurements to a simple binding
model.

p23 anisotropy
Fluorescein-labeled p23 was excited at 490 nM
and emission was recorded at 520 nM. Measurements
were performed in 40 mM Hepes, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2 pH 7.5 with 50 nM p23-Fluorescein and 500 nM
yHsp90 at 30oC. Addition of 2 mM AMP-PNP was used
as a positive control to promote N domain dimerization,
thereby creating a binding site for p23.
