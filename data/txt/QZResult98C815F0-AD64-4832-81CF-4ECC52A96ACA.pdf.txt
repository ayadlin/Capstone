ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) has been proven to be associated with
the development of chemoresistance to imatinib (Glivec, STI571) which displays
high efficacy in treatment of BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML). However, the possible mechanisms of MDR1 modulation in the process of the
resistance development remain to be defined. Herein, galectin-1 was identified as a
candidate modulator of MDR1 by proteomic analysis of a model system of leukemia cell
lines with a gradual increase of MDR1 expression and drug resistance. Coincidently,
alteration of galectin-1 expression triggers the change of MDR1 expression as well as
the resistance to the cytotoxic drugs, suggesting that augment of MDR1 expression
engages in galectin-1-mediated chemoresistance. Moreover, we provided the first data
showing that NF-κB translocation induced by P38 MAPK activation was responsible
for the modulation effect of galectin-1 on MDR1 in the chronic myelogenous leukemia
cells. Galectin-1 might be considered as a novel target for combined modality therapy
for enhancing the efficacy of CML treatment with imatinib.

in CML patients, implying that the alternative mechanisms
may exist [10-12].
MDR1, the ABCB1 gene product, is an ABC
transporter at the cell surface responsible for extruding
the compounds out of the cell, and has the potentials
of mediating multiple drug resistance (MDR) by
reducing intracellular drug concentrations [13]. Previous
investigations showed that imatinib is the substrate of
MDR1 and considered drug efflux mediated by MDR1
as a causal role for imatinib drug resistance in CML [14,
15]. But the precise mechanisms of MDR1 modulation in
chronic myelogenous leukemia cells remain to be unclear.
In the current study, we first applied proteomic approach
to identify galectin-1 as a candidate of MDR1 modulators
for mediating drug resistance in CML cells by comparison
of the protein profiles among a model system of leukemia
cell lines with a gradual increase of MDR1 expression and

INTRODUCTION
Formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene coding
for a constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase via
t(9;22)(q34;q11) reciprocal translocation initiates 95% of
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and 25% of adults
and 5% of children acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
[1]. Imatinib provides a promising treatment for CML by
high selectively binding to the ATP-binding site of BCRABL and inhibiting BCR-ABL activation [2]. However,
the occurrence of drug resistance was reported in CML
patients with advanced stages treated with imatinib [3].
Amplification of the BCR-ABL gene and mutations of
the kinase domain of ABL have been described as the
molecular mechanisms for the development of imatinib
resistance [4-9]. However, overexpression or mutations of
BCR-ABL could not explain all drug resistance to imatinib

to functional resistance against the cytotoxic drugs.

in K562/ADM cells compared with K562 cells, and
significantly down-regulated in the revertant K562/
ADM cells compared with K562/ADM cells. Whereas,
the expression levels of the other five identified proteins
in the revertant K562/ADM cells were less than those
in K562 cells, and higher than those in K562/ADM
cells (Figure 3). The differentially expressed proteins
related to cell behaviors, metabolism, calcium-binding,
proteolysis, cellular transcription, and signal transduction
maybe valuable for further elucidating the chemoresistant
mechanisms in CML.
Among the identified proteins, galectin-1 (Gal-1),
which exerts effects on cell apoptosis, proliferation and
differentiation, increased 4.85 folds in K562/ADM cells
compared with the revertant K562/ADM cells, and upregulated 22.3 folds compared with K562 cells, implying
that galectin-1 may contribute to augment of MDR1
expression and drug resistance in CML.

RESULTS
Characterization of the MDR phenotype in
K562, K562/ADM and the revertant K562/ADM
cells
Initially, the sensitivity profiles against adriamycin
and imatinib were explored in a model system of cell
lines including K562, K562/ADM and the revertant
K562/ADM cells. As shown in Table 1, the resistant
cell line K562/ADM displayed higher resistance against
adriamycin and imatinib, with 50-fold and 5-fold increase
of IC50 for adriamycin and imatinib respectively, than its
sensitive counterpart K562 cells. We observed that the
revertant K562/ADM cell line showed less resistance than
K562/ADM cell line but higher resistance than K562 cell
line against both adriamycin and imatinib, suggesting the
resistant cells gradually lose the resistant character when
cultured in the absence of the chemical compound.
Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysis showed that
the expression level of MDR1 in the revertant K562/
ADM cells is less than the resistant K562/ADM cells,
but higher than the sensitive ones, suggesting that the
expression level of MDR1 gradually decreases during the
course of cultivation in the absence of adriamycin (Figure
1). The results imply that a gradual increase of resistance
against adriamycin and imatinib is accompanied by a
gradual increase of MDR1 level during the course of
development of drug resistance in K562 cells exposed
to adriamycin.

Verification of galectin-1 expression
In order to confirm the trends of the expression
levels of galectin-1 identified by the proteomic
approach, q-PCR method was first applied to measure
the mRNA levels of galectin-1. The results present in
Figure 4A indicated that the mRNA level of galectin-1
in K562/ADM was 1.87 folds higher than the revertant
K562/ADM cells, and 4.4 folds than K562 cells,
respectively. Further western blot analysis revealed a
significant up-regulation of galectin-1 expression in
K562/ADM cells compared with the other two types of
cells with less drug resistance, which were paralleled
to the protein level changes observed in the proteomic
analysis (Figure 4B).
As the expression levels of galectin-1 increased with
the augment of drug resistance, and the resistant cell lines
were selected by exposure to adriamycin, we speculated
it may be the chemical drugs that trigger the increase of
galectin-1 product. Further investigations indicated that
both adriamycin and imatinib up-regulated galectin-1
expression in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4C and
4D).

Identification of galectin-1 as a significantly
up-regulated protein in resistant K562 cells
by 2D-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-TOF mass
spectrometry
In order to elucidate the mechanisms of MDR1
modulation in K562 cells, a proteomic approach was initially
applied to identify differentially expressed proteins among
three types of K562 cells with different MDR1 expression
and potentials of drug resistance. As shown in Figure 2, the
well-resolved, reproducible 2D-PAGE patterns of K562
(Figure 2A), K562/ADM (Figure 2B), and the revertant
K562/ADM cells (Figure 2C) were established, and yielded
about 1000 protein spots each. In total, 11 protein spots were
found to be differentially expressed among the investigated
cells. All of these were excised and analyzed by MALDITOF-TOF mass spectrometry and a subsequent search in the
IPI databases for protein identification. The identification
information was summarized in Table 2.
Among the identified differentially expressed
proteins, six of them were significantly up-regulated

Galectin-1 mediates chemoresistance in CML
In order to explore the role of galectin-1 identified
by proteomic approach in drug resistance, stable clone of
galectin-1 overexpressing cells, K562/Gal-1, was constructed
and characterized by q-PCR and immunoblotting. Compared
with K562/pcDNA3.1(-) (K562/pc) cells transfected with
the control vector, pronounced enhancement of galectin-1
expression at both transcriptional and translational levels was
observed in K562/Gal-1 cells (Figure 5A and 5B). Further
MTT assay results showed that overexpression of galectin-1
increased resistance to the detected chemical agents, with
4-fold higher IC50 of K562/Gal-1 cells (1.676±0.145 μg/ml of
adriamycin and 0.84±0.087 μM of imatinib) than that of K562/

We next evaluated the effects of galectin-1 siRNA
targeting treatment on the chemoresistance in K562/
ADM cells. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, treatment
of K562/ADM cells with 50 nM galectin-1 siRNA
induced down-regulation of galectin-1 expression at the
mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of galectin-1 in
K562/ADM cells could increase the chemosensitivity to
both adriamycin and imatinib treatment, with the IC50
of adriamycin decreasing from 26.56±0.41 μg/ml to
14.76±0.45 μg/ml, and that of imatinib from 2.5±0.214
μM to 1.1±0.12 μM as present in Table 3.

MDR1 in three types of cells with a gradual increase of
resistance against adriamycin and imatinib. In the light
of MDR1 directly contributing to the drug resistance by
exporting drugs out of the cell, combined with our results
showing that galectin-1 enhances the chemoresistance
in CML, we proposed that galectin-1 may decrease the
chemosensitivity via increase of MDR1 expression. To
address this issue, q-PCR was applied to compare the
mRNA levels of MDR1 between K562/pc and K562/Gal-1
cells, and between K562/ADM/sc siRNA and K562/ADM/
Gal-1 siRNA. The results present in Figure 6A indicated
that overexpression of galectin-1 up-regulated MDR1
transcription, while knockdown of galectin-1 decreased
the mRNA levels of MDR1. Alteration of galectin-1
expression had little effect on the other well-studied drug
transporter MRP1 (Figure 6B). The results suggest that
augment of MDR1 expression involves in galectin-1mediated chemoresistance.

Galectin-1 induces MDR1 expression via P38
MAPK activation and NF-κB translocation

on the activation of Erk1/2 and P38 MAPK cascades.
As shown in Figure 7A, overexpression of galectin-1
increased the phosphorylation levels of P38 rather than
Erk1/2, implying that activation of P38 MAPK signal
pathway may be responsible for mediating galectin-1
functions in K562 cells. Further suppression of P38
activation with the P38 inhibitor SB202190 attenuated
NF-κB translocation (Figure 7B), MDR1 gene promoter
activity (Figure 7C), and MDR1 mRNA levels (Figure
7D). Moreover, blockade of P38 activation in K562/Gal-1
cells decreased the chemoresistance to both adriamycin
and imatinib treatment, with the IC50 of adriamycin
reducing from 1.636±0.141 μg/ml to 1.29±0.125 μg/ml,
and that of imatinib from 0.8±0.083 μM to 0.4±0.037 μM.
Similar results were found in K562/ADM cells treated
with SB202190 (Table 3). Combined with the above
results, we suggest that galectin-1/P38 MAPK/NF-κB/

It has been investigated that NF-κB transcription
factor regulates MDR1 expression by specifically binding
to an intronic response element of MDR1 gene promoter
[16]. In the light of MAPK signal pathways mediating
nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which is required for its
transcription activity, and galectin-1 directly interacting
with Ras, which subsequently activates Erk1/2 and P38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathways
[17-19], we proposed that the mechanisms of galectin-1
inducing MDR1 expression may involve MAPK signal
activation and NF-κB translocation. In order to define
the signal pathway participating in mediating galectin1-induced NF-κB translocation, and subsequent MDR1
transcription, we first detected the effects of galectin-1

reason leading to imatinib resistance [15]. However, the
mechanisms by which the leukemia cells increase the
expression of this transmembrane export pump are still
unknown. We proposed that differentially expressed

moderate MDR1 expression. Coincident with Illmer T et
al reports [15], a gradual augment of MDR1 in K562 cell
lines is accompanied by an increase of resistant potentials
against adriamycin and imatinib. By comparison of the
protein profiles among three different K562 cell lines with
a gradual increase of MDR1 expression, we identified
galectin-1 as a candidate of MDR1 modulators for
enhancing drug resistance. Further investigations revealed
that galectin-1 induces MDR1 expression via P38 MAPK
activation and NF-κB translocation, which contributes to
the development of drug resistance.
Galectin-1 has a wide distribution in tissues and
is modulated accompanying with the alteration of the
physiological or pathological conditions. Accumulating
evidences have demonstrated that galectin-1 is closely
relevant to the tumor progression by promoting
transformation, angiogenesis, and metastasis [22-25].
However, there are few reports exploring the role of
galectin-1 in tumor chemoresistance. The endogenous

expression levels of galectin-1 vary in different kinds
of tumors. Some cancerous cells with high levels
of endogenous galectin-1 expression, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, have relative
high potentials of anti-chemotherapy. Suppression of
galectin-1 sensitizes the NSCLC cells to platinumbased chemotherapy [19]. In our studies, we found
the expression levels of the endogenous galectin-1
are pretty low in K562 cells, whereas significant upregulation of galectin-1 is observed in the corresponding
chemoresistant K562/ADM cells. Moreover, treatment
of K562 cells with adriamycin or imatinib could
increase galectin-1 expression, suggesting that tumor
cells may gradually develop drug resistance along with
the chemotherapy. These results imply that galectin-1
might be a potential biomarker for the chemoresistant
ability of tumor cells, and provide a novel target for
combined therapy for enhancing the efficiency of the
chemical drugs.

Promotion of apoptosis by galectin-1 in the activated
T cells has been extensively investigated in the past two
decades [26, 27]. The molecular mechanisms underlying
galectin-1 inducing apoptosis involve suppression of
anti-apoptotic protein expression and stimulation of
caspases [28]. As one mechanism by which tumor cells
develop drug resistance is associated with resistance to
apoptosis, it seems paradoxical that galectin-1 on one
hand induces apoptosis, and on the other hand contributes
to drug resistance. We initially presumed that galectin-1
may exert an oppose effect on the apoptosis in K562
cells as compared to the activated T cells. Therefore, flow
cytometric analysis was applied to determine the effects
of galectin-1 on the apoptosis of K562 cells. Contrary
to our speculation, galectin-1 significantly promoted
apoptosis of K562 cells treated with or without adriamycin
(data not shown). It seems that apoptosis induced by
galectin-1 contributes little to the galectin-1-triggered
drug resistance. In the light of reports suggesting that
galectin-1 does not activate a full apoptotic pathway in
some kinds of cells including T cells [29], T leukemia
cells, promyelocytic cells and activated neutrophils [30],
the possible explanation may be that K562 cells induced
by galectin-1 undergo partial apoptotic process, which has
less relevance with drug resistance than the full apoptotic
process does. However, further investigations are required
to clarify the relationship between galectin-1-elicited
apoptosis and drug resistance.
In summary, we found that galectin-1 was a novel
modulator of MDR1 by proteomic analysis of a model
system of leukemia cell lines with a gradual increase
of MDR1 expression and drug resistance, and NF-κB
translocation induced by P38 MAPK activation was
responsible for the enhancing effects of galectin-1 on
MDR1, suggesting that galectin-1 might be a novel target
for improving the efficacy of CML chemotherapy.

2D-PAGE and image analysis

recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)/Gal-1, which was
subsequently sent to Sangon Company (Shanghai, China)
for sequencing.
The recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)/Gal-1
harboring the correct galectin-1 coding sequence and the
control vector pcDNA3.1(-) were transfected into K562
cells with lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 3×104 K562 cells seeded
in an individual well of a 24-well culture plate were
transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA. After transfection
for 48 h, cells were selected in complete RPMI-1640
media containing G418 (500 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and
subsequently replated (10 cells/well) in 96-well culture
plate for continuous G418 selection. After cultured for
10 days, individual G418-resisitant colonies were picked,
propagated and screened for K562/Gal-1 cell clone stably
expressing galectin-1 by q-PCR and western blotting. The
sequences of galectin-1 and GAPDH primers for q-PCR
were shown in Table 4. GAPDH was used as an internal
control.

An equal amount (1 mg) of protein sample was
mixed with rehydration buffer complemented with 7 M
urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.2% BioLyte 3-10 ampholyte and 0.001% bromophenol blue, and
loaded on a 17 cm, pH3-10 nonlinear immobilized pH
gradient (IPG) gel strip (Bio-Rad). The IPG strips were
then passively rehydrated at 20°C for 13 h, and subjected
to isoelectric focusing (IEF) performed at 20 °C at 100
V for 30 min, 150 V for 3 h, 250 V for 1 h, 500 V for
1 h, 1000 V for 2 h, 5000 V for 3 h, 8000 V for 64000
V/h, and 500 V for 24 h. After IEF separation, the strip
was equilibrated, and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels
as previously described [32]. The gel was stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue G250 (Bio-Rad), and scanned
with a UMAX POWERLOOK 2100XL USB scanner
(UMAX, Dallas, TX, USA). PDQuest 8.0 software (BioRad) was used to analyze the images.

Mass spectrometric analysis and database search

Suppression of galectin-1 expression by small
interfering RNA

In-gel digestion of the differentially expressed
proteins was carried out before mass spectrometric
analysis. Briefly, the protein spots were excised, destained
in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate 50% NH4HCO3/
acetonitrile (ACN) (v/v), dehydrated in 100% ACN,
and then incubated with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The
peptides were extracted, dried in a vacuum concentrator
for 3 h, and subjected to tandem time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (ABI 4800 TOF-TOF) analysis. Mascot
software (Matrix science, London, UK) was applied to
search IPI (International Protein Index) databases for
protein identification.

A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting galectin-1
(Gal-1 siRNA) [19] with the sequence of sense 5’-GC
UGCCAGAUGGAUACGAAUUdtdt-3’,
and
antisense 5’-AAUUCGUAUCCAUCUGGCAGCdtdt’ was
synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). A scrambled
siRNA (sc siRNA) obtained from RiboBio was used as a
negative control. For siRNA-mediated inhibition of galectin-1
gene expression, K562/ADM cells were transfected with
Gal-1 siRNA or sc siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nM
using RNA MAX siRNA Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Silencing
efficiency was estimated at mRNA and protein levels by
q-PCR and western blotting.

Construction of K562/Gal-1 cell line stably
overexpressing galectin-1
The full-length galectin-1 coding sequence was
amplified from cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the total RNA
extracted from K562/ADM cells as the template. Briefly,
cDNA was synthesized via reverse transcription using
the oligo dT18, and subjected to PCR amplification of the
full-length galectin-1 coding sequence (NCBI accession
no. NM_002305.3). The PCR procedure comprised of an
initial step at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94
°C for 30 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and an
additional extension at 72 °C for 30 min. The following
primers were used for galectin-1 amplification: 5’-AG
CGGATCCATGGCTTGTGGTCTGGTC-3’ (forward,
BamHI site underlined) and 5’-TATAAGCTTTCAGTCA
AAGGCCACACA-3’ (reverse, HindIII site underlined).
The PCR products were purified by the TIANGEN
purification kit (TIANGEN, Beijing, China), digested with
BamHI and HindIII, and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(-)
vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to obtain the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated with PureZOL according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A first-strand cDNA
synthesis kit was applied to produce cDNAs from 1μg of
total RNA, which were then used as templates for q-PCR
amplification with the SYBR green q-PCR Kit using the
CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System. The
primers of galectin-1, MDR1, MRP1 and GAPDH were
showed in Table 4. GAPDH was amplified as an internal
control. The q-PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 59 °C for 20 s.

Western blotting analysis
Cells were harvested and lysed in 1 × SDS-PAGE
loading buffer, then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min at
4 °C to remove the insoluble components. The resultant
protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE gel

and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was
blocked at room temperature for 1 h in TBST (25 mM Tris,
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) containing
5% non-fat dry milk, and subsequently incubated with the
primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation
with goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked
antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were
detected with an ECL detection kit (Pierce) according to
the manufacturer’s procedure. GAPDH was used as the
reference control. The results were analyzed by Quantity
One software to determine the ratio relative to GAPDH.

GTG-3’ and 5’- TATAAAGCTTCTGCAGAAAAATTTC
TCCTAGCC-3’ (HindIII site was underlined), and inserted
into pGL3-EGFP at the identical site to construct a MDR1
promoter/EGFP reporter plasmid pGL3-proMDR1-EGFP.
Cells were seeded into 12-well tissue-culture plate
with 5 × 105 each well. After 6 h, K562/Gal-1 cells were
pretreated with P38 inhibitor SB202190 for 1 h prior
to transfection. Cells were transfected with the MDR1
promoter/EGFP reporter construct pGL3-proMDR1-EGFP
or the control vector pGL3-EGFP using lipofectamine LTX
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
After 48 h transfection, cells were harvested, washed
three times with cold PBS, and subjected to analysis
using a BD Bioscience FACScan (Becton Dickinson, NJ,
USA). Data were analyzed and presented using the Cell
Quest software. The relative fluorescence intensity was
calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity of cells
transfected with pGL3-proMDR1-EGFP by that of cells
transfected with the control vector pGL3-EGFP.

Extraction of nuclear proteins
Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a
density of 2.5×105 cells per well. After cultivation for
6 h, K562/Gal-1 cells were treated with P38 inhibitor
SB202190 at the concentration of 10 μM for 12 h, 24 h,
and 48 h before extraction of the nuclear proteins using the
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (KeyGEN
Biotech, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The protein concentration was determined by
a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The nuclear proteins (NFκB/p65 and PCNA) were analyzed by western blotting.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software 5.01. The student’s t-test was used
to compare data between two groups, and one way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used
for multiple comparison data. Differences were considered
significant at *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, and ***p< 0.001.

Promoter activity reporter assay
A promoter/EGFP reporter plasmid containing the
MDR1 promoter region (-982 to -7) was constructed
by replacement of the luciferase reporter with EGFP
reporter in pGL3-basic (Promega; Madison, WI, USA).
Briefly, EGFP reporter was first amplified by PCR using
the plasmid EGFP-N3 as a template and the primer pair:
5’-GCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3’ forward,
and 5’-CGCGTCTAGATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCC
ATGCCGAGAG-3’ reverse, (NcoI and XbaI sites were
underlined, respectively), and substituted for the luciferase
reporter in the plasmid pGL3-basic at the identical sites
to obtain the EGFP reporter plasmid pGL3-EGFP. MDR1
promoter region was then amplified from human genomic
DNA extracted from HUVEC cells using the following
primer pair: 5’-ATATAAGCTTCTGCAGGGGCTTTCCT
