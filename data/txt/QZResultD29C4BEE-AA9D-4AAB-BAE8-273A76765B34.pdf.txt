BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of approximately 60%
of all human genes. They play important roles in numerous cellular processes, including development, proliferation,
and apoptosis. Currently, it is believed that miRNAs elicit their effect by silencing the expression of target genes. In
this study, the authors demonstrated that miRNA-205 (miR-205) induced the expression the interleukin (IL) tumor
suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 by targeting specific sites in their promoters. METHODS: The methods used in this
study included transfection of small RNAs; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; in situ hybridization;
fluorescence-labeled in situ hybridization; cell cycle, apoptosis, cell viability, migratory, clonability, and invasion
assays; immunoblotting; and luciferase reporter, nuclear run-on, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: The results revealed that miR-205 was silenced in prostate cancer. Its re-expression induced apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest. It also impaired cell growth, migration, clonability, and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. MicroRNA-205 induced the expression of tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 at both the messenger RNA and protein
levels. The induction of in vitro transcription and enrichment of markers for transcriptionally active promoters in the
IL24 and IL32 genes was observed in response to miR-205. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a new function for miR-205
was identified that specifically activated tumor suppressor genes by targeting specific sites in their promoters.
These results corroborate a newly identified function that miRNAs have in regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level. The specific activation of tumor suppressor genes (eg, IL24, IL32) or other dysregulated genes by
miRNA may contribute to a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. Cancer 2010;116:5637–

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are nonprotein-coding sequences that are believed to regulate the expression of up to 60%

of human genes, either by inhibiting mRNA translation or by inducing its degradation.1,2 These small RNAs play
important roles in numerous cellular processes, including development, proliferation, and apoptosis.3 In addition to their
crucial role in cellular differentiation and organism development,4 miRNAs frequently are misregulated in human
cancers5,6 and can act as either potent oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.7
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignant tumor and the second leading cause of cancer
deaths among men in the United States. It is estimated that, in 2009, there will have been >192,280 newly diagnosed
cases of PCa and >27,360 attributed deaths.8 Although surgery and radiotherapy generally are effective against clinically
localized PCa, androgen ablation, the treatment of choice for advanced disease, leads to only temporary tumor regression.9
The lack of available treatment options for effectively eradicating advanced PCa makes the development of alternative
approaches urgent. Understanding the molecular alterations that distinguish progressive disease from nonprogressive
disease will help identify novel prognostic markers or therapeutic targets. Some aberrantly produced miRNAs have been

identified in PCa cell lines, xenografts, and clinical
samples.10 These miRNAs may play critical roles in the
pathogenesis of PCa.
miRNA-205 (miR-205) expression in cancer is
controversial, because it reportedly is either up-regulated11,12 or down-regulated13,14 in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Currently, it is believed that
miRNAs elicit their effect by silencing the expression of
target genes.15 Given the functional complexity of
miRNA-mediated gene regulation, it is unlikely that the
effects of these molecules are limited to gene silencing.
The objective of the current study was to investigate the
potential involvement of miR-205 in positively regulating the expression of the interleukin (IL) tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32.
It has been reported that IL24 is a novel tumor
suppressor gene whose expression is lost during tumorigenesis.16 Gene transfer of an adenovirus-expressed melanoma
differentiation associated 7 (mda-7)/IL24 into numerous
histologic types of human tumor cell lines, including melanoma, glioblastoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic
cancer, and others, resulted in tumor-specific growth
arrest.17-20 In addition to its direct apoptosis-inducing
properties, IL24 has antiangiogenic, radiosensitizing,
immunostimulatory, and potent ‘‘bystander’’ antitumor activity 21-23 These divergent anticancer properties of mda-7/
IL24 make it an ideal candidate for anticancer therapy. A
recent phase 1 clinical trial in which a replication-incompetent adenovirus that expressed IL24 was used produced evidence of clinical activity with limited toxicity. Thus, IL24 is
being hailed as a ‘‘magic bullet’’ for cancer gene therapy.
IL32 is a novel cytokine that has been implicated in inflammation24 and cell death.25 It has been established that IL32
associates specifically with apoptotic T cells, and ectopic
expression of IL32 in HeLa cells causes apoptosis.25 Our
data indicated that there was strong induction of the IL24
and IL32 tumor suppressor genes in response to miR-205.
In the current study, we identified a new function for miR205 in regulating tumor suppressor genes.

were cultured as described previously.26 Transfection of
miRNA was carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) according to the manufactures’s protocol. All miRNA treatments proceeded for
72 hours.
Quantitative real-time polymerases chain reaction

Mature miRNAs and other messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) were assayed using TaqMan miRNA assays and
gene expression assays, respectively, in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Samples were normalized to RNU48 or
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as
indicated. Comparative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in triplicate, including notemplate controls.
In situ hybridization

For cell lines, the cells were grown on sterile slides in
100-mm Petri dishes for 48 hours. Then, these cells were
stained by using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled, locked
nucleic acid (LNA)-based probes specific for miR-205
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (www.exiqon.
com accessed December 15, 2009). Last, the cells were
detected by using anti-DIG-fluorescein, fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind). Nuclei were stained routinely by using
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Tissue array
slides contained human normal adjacent prostate tissue
samples (n ¼ 15) and samples stage II (n ¼ 14), stage III
(n ¼ 52), stage IV (n ¼ 6), and metastatic (n ¼ 8) carcinomas. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 52 C
after the addition of 50 nM DIG-labeled, LNA-based
probes that were specific for miR-205 and U6 (Exiqon
Inc., Woburn, Mass). Alkaline phosphatase activity was
detected using BM Purple AP Substrate (Roche Applied
Science). In situ hybridization (ISH) results were graded
semiquantitatively according to staining intensity, scored
from 1 to 4, and normalized to U6 levels.

Flow cytometry, cell viability, migratory,
clonability, and invasion assays

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses were done
72 hours after transfection using the nuclear stain DAPI
for cell cycle analysis or the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) Kit
(Beckman Coulter, Inc. Fullerton, Calif) for apoptosis
analyses according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell
viability was determined at 24 hours, 48 hours, and
72 hours by using the CellTiter 96 AQueous 1 Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the colony
formation assay, cells were seeded at low density (1000 or
200 cells per plate) and were allowed to grow for 3 weeks.
Then, the cells were stained with crystal violet, and colonies were counted. An artificial ‘‘wound’’ was created on a
confluent cell monolayer, and photomicrographs were
taken after 24 hours for a migration assay. The invasiveness of PC3 cells was assessed with an invasion assay in a
modified Boyden chamber as described elsewhere.28
Luciferase assays

A 2.2-kb promoter reporter vector of IL24 (identification no. (ID), 114318_CHR1_P1626_R1[IL24]) was
obtained from SwitchGear Genomics (Menlo Park, Calif)
along with the positive (ID, RPL10_PROM) and negative
(ID, EMPTY_PROM) promoter control vectors. The assay
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(www.switchgeargenomics.com accessed December 25, 2009).

buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl; and
3 mM MgCl2), and centrifuged at 500g for 10 minutes.
Supernatants were removed, and the nuclei were incubated
in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 mM
MgCl2; and 0.3 mM KCl) and 2.5 mM nucleoside triphosphate plus biotin-16-uridine 50 -triphosphate mix (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind) for 45 minutes at
30 C. The transcription reaction was stopped by adding
RNA STAT-60 Reagent (Tel-Test, Ind., Friendswood,
Tex) to isolate total nuclear RNA according to manufacturer-recommended protocols. Biotinylated nascent RNA
transcripts were isolated by incubation with streptavidin
beads (Active Motif, Carlsbad, Calif) for 2 hours at room
temperature on a rocking platform. Beads were collected by
centrifugation and washed once with 2  standard saline citrate (SSC)-15% formamide for 10 minutes and twice with
2  SSC for 5 minutes on a rocking platform. Biotinylated RNA was eluted from streptavidin beads in H2O or
10 mM ethylene diamine tetracetic acid, pH 8.2, by incubation at 90 C for 10 minutes and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
were performed using the EZ-ChIP Kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described previously.27 Immunoprecipitation
was performed using antibodies purchased from Upstate
Biotechnology and recognized acetyl histone 3 (catalog no.
06-599), acetyl histone 4 (catalog no. 06-866), and
dimethyl-histone H3 lysine (Lys) 4 (catalog no. 07-030).
Power SYBR Green PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems)
was used to perform real-time PCR on a 7500 Fast RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Signals were also
confirmed by conventional PCR and gel analyses.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using StatView version
5.0 for Windows (Stata Corp., College Station, Tex). The
Student t test was used to compare the different groups.
P values <.05 were regarded as statistically significant and
are represented by asterisks in the figures.

Nuclear run-on assays

Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described
by Kim et al.29 Metastatic PCa PC3 cells were transfected
with control or miR-205 duplexes (Ambion Inc., Austin,
Tex) at 50 nM final concentration using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Seventy-two hours after transfection,
2  107 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, lysed on ice in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis

Du145) PCa cells compared with nonmalignant RWPE1 cells (Fig. 1A). Because it has been reported that LNAmodified miRNA probes markedly increase hybridization
affinity to miRNAs compared with traditional RNAbased or DNA-based probes, a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled
LNA-miR-205 probe was used to detect miR-205
abundance in human PCa cell lines using ISH and an
FITC-labeled anti-DIG antibody. Consistent with the
results described above, fluorescent signal was detected in
RWPE-1 cells and represented the abundance of miR-205
in this cell line, whereas the signal was absent in the cancer
cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and Du145 (Fig. 1B).
To examine the clinical relevance of miR-205, its
expression was analyzed in carcinoma and benign prostate
hyperplasia (BPH) tissue samples. Almost all carcinoma
samples had significantly down-regulated miR-205
expression compared with expression in the BPH samples,
and lower relative average expression was observed overall
in carcinoma tissues compared with BPH tissues (Fig.
2A). An ISH analysis of miR-205 expression also was performed on tissue arrays that contained normal adjacent
prostate tissue samples (n ¼ 15) and samples of stage II (n
¼ 14), stage III (n ¼ 52), stage IV (n ¼ 6), and metastatic
(n ¼ 8) carcinomas. Normal adjacent prostate tissue samples highly expressed miR-205 indicated by the BM-Purple stain. Figure 2B depicts representative ISH results
indicating that normal adjacent samples expressed markedly increased miR-205 expression levels, whereas miR205 expression was almost absent in primary and metastatic PCa samples. These ISH results suggest that expression of miR-205 is significantly high in normal tissues
compared with PCa tissues.
MicroRNA-205 Induces Apoptosis and Cell
Cycle Arrest and Impairs the Cell Viability,
Migratory, Clonability, and Invasive Properties
of PCa Cells
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that
re-expression of miR-205 led to a significant increase
(10%  3%) in the number of cells in G0-G1—phase of
the cell cycle, whereas the S-phase population decreased
from 21%  3% to 10%  2%, suggesting that miR-205
caused a G0-G1 arrest in miR-205-transfected PC3 cells
compared with a nonspecific miRNA control (Cont-miR)
(Fig. 3A). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for
apoptosis was performed using annexin-V-FITC-7-AAD
dye. The percentage of total apoptotic cells (early apoptotic cells þ apoptotic cells) increased significantly (11% 
3%) in response to miR-205 transfection compared with

Cancer

Cont-miR (3%  2%), and a corresponding 8%  2%
decrease was observed in the viable cell population
(Fig. 3A). A colony formation assay revealed that overexpression of miR-205 significantly decreased the ability of
metastatic PC3 cells to form colonies compared with
Cont-miR-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). MicroRNA-205
caused drastic changes in cell morphology associated with
growth arrest, including increased size and a broad,
flattened shape 3 days (72 hours) after transfection
(Fig. 3B). Cell viability after miR-205 overexpression
decreased significantly (8%-30% decrease) in a timedependent manner (from 0 hours to 72 hours) compared
with Cont-miR-transfected cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that
miR-205 has an antiproliferative effect in PCa. Wound
and transwell invasion assays were carried out to evaluate
whether miR-205 affects the migratory and invasive
capabilities of PCa cells. The average numbers of invading
cells that were transfected with miR-205 were significantly lower (190  11 cells) lower than the numbers of
Cont-miR-transfected cells (500  16 cells) (Fig. 3C).
We also observed that the cells that overexpressed
miR-205 cells were less proficient than the equivalent
Cont-miR-transfected cells at closing the artificial wound
that we created over a confluent monolayer (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that miR-205 impairs the migratory capability
of the metastatic PC3 PCa cells.
MicroRNA-205 Targets the IL24 and IL32
Promoters to Induce Gene Expression
Our preliminary microarray data (unpublished data)
revealed that there was strong induction of the IL24 and
IL32 genes in response to miR-205 transfection. To determine whether these genes have target sites for miR-205,
we scanned 1-kb promoters of both genes for sequences
that were complementary to miR-205 using the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/ accessed October 5, 2009). Our scanning analysis revealed a potential binding sequence
located at positions 107 (IL24) and 610 (IL32) relative to the transcription start site in the promoters of both
genes (Fig. 4A). We transfected a pre-miR-205 precursor
(Ambion) and a control miR precursor (Ambion) into
metastatic PC3 PCa cells and analyzed IL24 and IL32
expression 72 hours after transfection. An analysis of
mRNA expression revealed a profound induction in the
levels of IL24 (8-fold) and IL32 (5-fold) after miR205 transfection compared with Cont-miR transfection
(Fig. 4B). Induction of these genes was confirmed further
by immunoblot analysis. Figure 4C reveals that elevated

IL24 and IL32 protein levels were correlated strongly with
increased mRNA expression levels. These results suggest
that miR-205 induces gene expression by targeting the
promoters of these genes.
Sequence Specificity for Gene Induction
by MicroRNA-205 and Direct Interaction
Between MicroRNA-205 and Promoter
Target Sequence
To determine whether the induction of IL24 and IL32
was specific to the sequence of miR-205, we synthesized 2
miR-205 mutants to create mismatches with the target
sites. Mutation to 8 or 11 bases in the miR-205 sequence
resulted in mutant derivatives miR-205-5MM and
miR-205-3MM, respectively (Fig. 5A). Figure 5B reveals
that neither miR-205-5MM nor miR-205-3MM were

5644

capable of inducing IL24 or IL32 expression, suggesting
that the induction of these genes was specific to the
sequence of miR-205.
We also performed a luciferase reporter assay to
verify that a direct interaction between miR-205 and
IL24 was responsible for the increased expression of
IL24. The IL24 vector contained a 2.2-kb promoter
sequence that included the binding site for miR-205 and
an empty vector that served as a negative control. These
reporter vectors were cotransfected in PC3 cells with
miR-205 precursor and Cont-miR molecules that served
as a negative control. The luciferase activity increased
markedly after miR-205 overexpression compared with
the negative control (Fig. 5C), supporting the evidence
that miR-205 induces IL24 directly by targeting the promoter sequence.

promoter vector that contained the binding site for miR-205 was purchased from SwitchGear Genomics (Menlo Park, Calif) and
cotransfected with miR-205 or Cont-miR, and luciferase activity was measured after 48 hours. Luciferase activity was normalized
to total protein, and relative expression was determined for Cont-miR and miR-205. RLU indicates relative luciferase U. Asterisks
indicate P < .05 (statistically significant). (D) Activation of in vitro transcription by miR-205 is illustrated. Data were derived from

levels. Asterisks indicate P < .05 (statistically significant); RLU, relative luciferase units.

MicroRNA-205 Induces In Vitro Transcription
in IL24 and IL32 Genes
We performed a nuclear run-on assay to measure the relative in situ transcription rate of specific genes in intact
nuclei. Within a given experiment, the nuclear run-on
assay can be used to determine the level of transcription
for several different genes. The isolated nuclei contain the
full transcription machinery for synthesis of mRNA.
Therefore, it is regarded as the gold-standard measurement of overall transcriptional activity of a specific
promoter. After the transcriptional reaction, biotinylated
RNA was isolated, qRT-PCR was conducted. The relative
IL24 and IL32 mRNA levels reflected the transcription
efficiency of both genes. Figure 5D reveals that miR-205transfected cells had significantly higher mRNA expres-

sion levels of IL24 (7-fold) and IL32 (5-fold) compared
with Cont-miR-transfected cells, suggesting that miR205 induces the transcriptional activity of IL24 and IL32
promoters.
MicroRNA-205 Causes Enrichment of Markers
for Transcriptionally Active Promoters
Several histone modifications, mainly acetylation of
histones 3 and 4 and dimethylation and trimethylation of
Lys 4 histone 3 (2H3K4 and 3H3K4, respectively), have
been established as markers for transcriptionally active
promoters. To determine whether overexpression of
miR-205 results in the enrichment of active chromatin
modifications in IL24 and IL32 promoters, we performed
ChIP assays on miR-205-transfected and Cont-miR-

cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PC3 cells, the expression of several downstream proteins involved in these pathways also was
examined. Proapoptotic and cell cycle checkpoint proteins were induced in response to miR-205 compared with Cont-miR. BAK

response to miR-205 compared with Cont-miR was indicative of gene activation by miR-205. Therefore, the
increased levels of mRNA and protein expression of IL24
and IL32 (Fig. 4B,C) in response to miR-205 overexpression were correlated with the enrichment of markers for
transcriptionally active promoters in both genes.
Effect of MicroRNA-205 on
Downstream Targets
MicroRNA-205 overexpression induced apoptosis, impaired cell migration and invasion, and caused cell cycle
arrest in metastatic PC3 cells. MicroRNA-205 also induced
the expression of IL24, which controls cell survival and proliferation and induces apoptosis selectively in cancer cells

5646

without harming normal cells. We examined the protein
expression of various downstream genes involved in these
pathways. Figure 6C reveals that the protein expression of
proapoptotic genes, cell cycle regulators, and downstream
targets of IL24, which are involved in the inhibition of
migration, increased in PC3 cells that were transfected
with miR-205 compared with Cont-miR-transfected cells
(Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that miR205 acts as tumor suppressor miRNA by directly targeting
the tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 through apoptotic and cell-survival pathways in PCa.

apoptosis.3 Currently, it is believed that miRNAs elicit
their effect by silencing the expression of target genes.15
However, in the current study, we identified 2 genes
(IL24 and IL32) that have target sites complementary to
miR-205 within their promoters, and the overexpression
of miR-205 readily induced the expression of both genes.
Several lines of evidence indicated that gene induction
was specific for miR-205 and the targeted promoter sites:
1) No modifications to miR-205 or pre-miR-205 sequences were required for gene induction. We synthesized
native miR-205 molecules to ensure that we were analyzing the natural miR-205 sequence function. 2) Nonspecific control molecules (Cont-miR) had no impact on
target gene expression. 3) Activity required complementarity with target sequences. Mutation of the nucleotides
involved in target recognition completely prevented gene
induction by miR-205. 4) Selective activation of IL24 was
achieved by targeting binding sites in its promoter, as confirmed in our luciferase reporter assay, and suggested that
activation of this gene by miR-205 was specific for the
miRNA target sites in the gene promoter. Previous reports
from our laboratory and others30,31 have revealed that
small double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which target the
promoters of E-cadherin, p21WAF1/CIP1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), progesterone receptor, and
major vault protein, readily activate gene expression.
Those reports indicated an unexpected ability of small
RNAs to induce gene expression.
The expression of miR-205 in cancer is controversial, because reports have indicated that it is upregulated11,12 and down-regulated13,14 in tumor tissues
compared with normal tissues. We observed that miR205 was markedly down-regulated in PCa cell lines,
irrespective of their androgen responsiveness, compared
with normal cells. Reduction of miR-205 expression also
was observed in cancer tissues compared with BPH
tissues. These findings indicate that reduced miR-205
expression in PCa may be important for PCa progression.
To examine this possibility, we re-expressed miR-205 in
metastatic PC-3 cells. Its re-expression induced changes in
cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell morphology. MicroRNA-205-transfected cells had impaired clonability, migratory, and invasive capabilities. Altogether,
our findings are consistent with other reports32,33 suggesting that miR-205 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA.
A previous report33 described the tumor suppressive
functions of miR-205 as involving reversal of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the down-regulation
of protein kinase-C epsilon, whereas our results were

distinct and identified a new function for miR-205 in
inducing tumor suppressor genes by targeting their
promoters.
We also observed that the IL24 and IL32 promoters
were direct targets of miR-205. Luciferase activity
increased significantly after miR-205 overexpression compared with negative control, indicating that miR-205
induces IL24 by directly targeting its promoter sequence.
Furthermore, none of the mutated sequences of miR-205
were capable of inducing IL24 or IL32 expression,
suggesting that the induction of these genes was specific
to the sequence of miR-205. Our results indicate that
miR-205 induced the expression of these tumor suppressor genes by targeting their promoters.
Recent studies have identified chromatin signatures
that can be used to identify active promoters in human
cells.34-36 Several histone modifications, mainly 2H3K4,
3H3K4, and acetylation of Lys 9/14 of histone 3, have
been established as markers for transcriptionally active
promoters.35,37,38 Because IL24 and IL32 were activated
transcriptionally by miR-205, we analyzed the status
of local active histone modifications, such as acetylation
of histone H3 and H4, 2H3K4, and polymerase II.
We observed that there was enrichment of these active
histone modifications in response to miR-205 indicative
of transcriptionally active promoters in the IL24 and IL32
genes, consistent with the mRNA and protein expression
of both genes.
We also performed a nuclear run-on assay that
measures the relative in vitro transcription rate of specific
genes in intact nuclei. The isolated nuclei contain the full
transcription machinery for synthesis of mRNA. The
IL24 and IL32 gene transcription activity revealed by
the nuclear run-on assay was increased in the nuclear
extracts from cells transfected miR-205 compared with
Cont-miR cells, suggesting that miR-205 induces transcriptional activity of the IL24 and IL32 promoters.
Given the functional complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation, it is unlikely that the effects of these
molecules are limited to gene silencing. A previous report
from our laboatory30 revealed that exogenously introduced dsRNAs activated the expression of E-cadherin,
p21, or VEGF by targeting noncoding regulatory regions
in gene promoters. Gene activation by dsRNA required
the argonaute 2 protein and was associated with a loss of
Lys 9 methylation on histone 3 at dsRNA target sites.30
Like these exogenously introduced dsRNAs, it is possible
that miRNAs also may act to positively regulate gene
expression. However, to understand the mechanism,

further research will be required to identify the molecular
components involved in miRNA-activated gene expression.
In summary, we have provided a proof of principle
that miRNA-205 functions as a tumor suppressor in upregulating the tumor suppressor genes IL24 and IL32 by
targeting specific sites in their promoters. Enrichment of
the active histone modifications in response to miR-205,
indicative of transcriptionally active promoters in both
genes, also was observed. The identification of this
phenomenon in which cancer cells can be targeted with
miRNA to turn on silenced tumor suppressor genes may
have significant therapeutic potential. The use of RNA
interference currently is being implemented as a genespecific approach for molecular medicine. According to
the same principle, the specific activation of tumor
suppressor genes (eg, IL24, IL32) or other dysregulated
genes by miRNA may contribute to a novel therapeutic
approach in the treatment of PCa.
