ABSTRACT
EGFR T790M mutation accounts for about 40-55% drug resistance for the first
generation EGFR kinase inhibitors in the NSCLC. Starting from ibrutinib, a highly
potent irreversible BTK kinase inhibitor, which was also found to be moderately active
to EGFR T790M mutant, we discovered a highly potent irreversible EGFR inhibitor
CHMFL-EGFR-26, which is selectively potent against EGFR mutants including L858R,
del19, and L858R/T790M. It displayed proper selectivity window between the EGFR
mutants and the wide-type. CHMFL-EGFR-26 exhibited good selectivity profile among
468 kinases/mutants tested (S score (1)=0.02). In addition, X-ray crystallography
revealed a distinct “DFG-in” and “cHelix-out” inactive binding mode between
CHMFL-EGFR-26 and EGFR T790M protein. The compound showed highly potent antiproliferative efficacy against EGFR mutant but not wide-type NSCLC cell lines through
effective inhibition of the EGFR mediated signaling pathway, induction of apoptosis and
arresting of cell cycle progression. CHMFL-EGFR-26 bore acceptable pharmacokinetic
properties and demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth suppression in the H1975
(EGFR L858R/T790M) and PC-9 (EGFR del19) inoculated xenograft mouse models.
Currently CHMFL-EGFR-26 is undergoing extensive pre-clinical evaluation for the
clinical trial purpose.

mutations of EGFR such as del19 and L858R have been
observed in 10-35% NSCLC patients [2]. The aberrant
activation of EGFR leads to activation of downstream
signaling pathways associated with tumor growth and
progression [3]. The first generation EGFR kinase

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which upon
ligand EGF (epidermal growth factor) binding will result
in auto-phosphorylation and subsequently lead to activation

inhibitors, such as Gefitinib, have shown great clinical
efficacy for the EGFR mutant driven NSCLC, but after
a period of treatment, most patients will develop EGFR
T790M-induced drug resistance [4]. The drug resistance
is mainly caused by the higher binding affinity of ATP in
T790M EGFR protein compared to inhibitors, and steric
hindrance due to the mutation [4]. Fortunately, T790M
mutant of EGFR is still sensitive to the second-generation
EGFR inhibitors such as Afatinib, which bind EGFR
irreversibly through the formation of covalent bond [5–7].
However, the narrow selectivity window between the EGFR
wt and T790M mutant led to side effects, which raised a
safety concern for application of these drugs [8]. This
encouraged the discovery of the third generation inhibitors,
such as AZD9291 and CO-1686, which achieved better
selectivity between EGFR wt and T790M mutant [9, 10].
Recently, Ibrutinib, an FDA approved irreversible
BTK kinase inhibitor for MCL, CLL etc, has been found
to be moderately active against EGFR T790M mutant
and has been evaluated in the clinic [11, 12]. However,
the efficacy of Ibrutinib for suppression of EGFRT790M
mediated tumor progression was limited and required
combination of other signaling pathway inhibitors such
as MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 [11]. In consideration
of these limitations, we developed a novel highly potent
EGFR inhibitor CHMFL-EGFR-26 which selectively
inhibits EGFR oncogenic mutations including L858R,
del19 and L858R/T790M. CHMFL-EGFR-26 irreversibly
inhibits EGFR kinase via formation a covalent bond with
Cys797 residue in a distinct DFG-in-cHelix-out inactive
conformation of EGFR and displays good in vitro and
in vivo anti-NSCLC efficacies in the preclinical models.

to 0.013μM) meanwhile kept over 500-fold selectivity
over EGFR wt (GI50: 5.4 μM). In addition, it did not
exhibit any apparent inhibitory activity against parental
BaF3 cells (GI50: >10 μM) indicating no general toxicity.
For all of the sensitive mutants, when C797S mutant was
introduced, CHMFL-EGFR-26 lost activity significantly
(50-10000 folds) which suggested an irreversible
binding mode via cysteine 797 residue. Furthermore,
the reversible version of CHMFL-EGFR-26, which was
generated by saturation of acrylamide to propionamide
(CHMFL-EGFR-26R, chemical structure shown in Figure
1A), almost completely lost the activity to the CHMFLEGFR-26 sensitive mutants. This again indicated that
CHMFL-EGFR-26 inhibited those EGFR mutants through
an irreversible binding mode via cysteine 797 residue. The
FDA approved third generation EGFR inhibitor AZD9291
(the chemical structure is showed in Supplementary
Figure 3) displayed a similar trend in this growth
inhibitory assay except that it also exhibited moderate
inhibitory activity against parental BaF3 cells (GI50: 1.5
μM versus >10 μM) and the selectivity window between
the EGFR mutants and WT was narrower than CHMFLEGFR-26. The enzymatic inhibition result of CHMFLEGFR-26 was detected by SelectScreen techonology
(Life Technologies). CHMFL-EGFR-26 showed an IC50 of
19nM against EGFR T790M mutant, 71nM against EGFR
WT and 215 nM against EGFR L858R mutant (Table 2).
The selectivity window in biochemical assay was narrower
than in the cellular assay between EGFR wt and T790M
mutant, we reasoned that this might be due to the different
conformations of EGFR kinases in vitro and in cell.
In order to further confirm this compound’s on-target
effect, we then examined its effect on the blockage of
EGFR auto-phosphorylation in EGFR transformed BaF3
isogenic cell lines. The results demonstrated that upon
4h’s CHMFL-EGFR-26 treatment, the phosphorylation
of EGFR Y1068 was inhibited with an EC50 of 3.6 nM
in BaF3-FL-EGFR-L858R -T790M cells and 50 nM in
BaF3-TEL-EGFR cells (Figure 1B), suggesting that the
drug shows 15-fold selectivity between the EGFR wt and
EGFRL858R/T790M. Meanwhile, AZD9291 exhibited
similar selectivity between the EGFR wt and EGFR
L858R/T790M mutant Y1068 auto-phosphorylation (EC50:
63nM and 3.2 nM respectively).

RESULTS
Rational design of EGFR mutant inhibitor
CHMFL-EGFR-26
In our previous research, we have found that the
FDA approved irreversible BTK kinase inhibitor Ibrutinib
could also selectively and potently inhibit EGFR primary
mutants such as L858R and del19 [11]. In addition, it
exhibited moderately inhibitory activity against EGFR
gatekeeper mutant T790M. Based on the structure
of Ibrutinib, we rationally designed a novel inhibitor
CHMFL-EGFR-26 which was expected to improve the
binding efficiency against EGFR T790M drug resistant
mutant meanwhile keep the selectivity over EGFR wt.
(Figure 1A, chemical synthetic procedures were listed
in the supplemental materials and synthetic scheme was
shown in Supplementary Figure 1.) We first tested the antiproliferative effects of CHMFL-EGFR-26 in a panel of
EGFR kinase wt/mutants expressing BaF3 isogenic cell
lines (Table 1). The results demonstrated that CHMFLEGFR-26 potently inhibited EGFR L858R, del19, T790M
and L858R/T790M mutants (GI50s range from 0.0003 μM

In order to better understand CHMFL-EGFR26’s selectivity, we then tested it in DiscoveRx’s
KinomeScanTM assay. The results revealed that it was
highly selective among 468 kinases/mutants (S score
(1)=0.02) tested at the concentration of 1μM. (Figure
1C and Supplementary Table 1) Besides EGFR wt and
mutants, it also displayed strong binding to BLK, BTK,
Her2, Her4, JAK3, LOK, MEK1 and MEK5. Given

sometimes cannot truly reflect the compound inhibitory
activity, we then used Invitrogen SelectScreen® assay
to test these potential off-targets (Supplementary Table
2). The results showed that CHMFL-EGFR-26 also
exhibited strong inhibition for BLK (IC50=3.9nM), Her4
(IC50=5.39nM), Her2 (IC50=15.9nM),BTK (IC50=16.3nM),
BMX (IC50=38.9nM), JAK3 (IC50=30.6nM) and moderate
activity against MEK1 (IC50=131nM). This was not
surprising because EGFR, JAK3, HER2, HER4 and TEC
family kinases (BTK, BLK and BMX) all share a similar
cysteine residue at the identical position analogous to Cys
797 in EGFR in the hinge binding area [13]. In addition,
considering that some of the EGFR inhibitors induced
hyperglycemia in the clinic, which was possibly through
inhibition of the INSR and IGF1R kinases, we also tested
this drug in parallel with AZD9291 in the INSR and
IGF1R transformed isogenic BaF3 cells. (Supplementary
Table 3) The results revealed that it was much less potent
than AZD9291 against both INSR (GI50: 2.8μM versus 0.5
μM) and IGF1R (GI50: 3.6 μM versus 0.56 μM) indicating
that there was much less chance that this drug could
induce the hyperglycemia adverse effects.
To better understand CHMFL-EGFR-26’s binding
mode, we then tried to obtain its X-ray crystal structure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in complex with EGFR T790M mutant (PDB ID: 5GTY,
data shown in Supplementary Table 4). As expected, the
crystal structure showed that the acrylamide of CHMFLEGFR-26 formed a covalent bond with Cys797 of EGFR
(Figure 1D). The aminopyrimidine formed two hydrogen
bonds with Met793 and Gln791 in the hinge binding area.
The Met790 oriented in parallel with the cholorophenol
moiety and formed a beneficial hydrophobic interaction.
Furthermore, the Cl-atom formed a halogen bond with
Leu788 carbonyl which presumably contributed to the
high binding affinity [14]. Furthermore, it is interesting
to note that EGFR T790M adopted a distinct DFG-incHelix-out inactive conformation when bound to CHMFLEGFR-26, which is different from the typical type I EGFR
inhibitors such as WZ4002 (PDB ID 3AKI). (Figure 1E)
This special conformation generated larger hydrophobic
pocket which accommodated the methylpyridine moiety.
(Figure 1F).

result demonstrated that CHMFL-EGFR-26 was highly
potent against EGFR L858R/T790M mutant expressing
cell line H1975 (GI50: 0.0003 μM), which was about 170fold more potent than AZD9291 (GI50: 0.052μM). (Table
3) In addition, it also potently inhibited the growth of
EGFR del19 expressing cells (PC9 and HCC827: GI50:
0.035μM and 0.036 μM) and EGFR L858R expressing
cell (H3255 GI50: 0.027 μM). It significantly lost activity
against EGFR wt expressing NSCLC cell lines such as
A549( GI50: 5.4μM), H1355 (GI50: 8.1 μM), H2122 (GI50:
3.5 μM ) and H1703 (GI50: 7.7 μM), which is in the similar
trend as AZD9291. The washout experiment in H1975,
PC9 and H3255 cell lines revealed a time- and dosedependent blockage of EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation.
(Supplementary Figure 2) Combining the results that
CHMFL-EGFR-26R, which lost its irreversible binding
capability, completely lost activity against those sensitive
cell lines, these further confirmed that CHMFL-EGFR26’s irreversible binding mode observed in the X-ray
crystal structure was biologically relevant. Furthermore,
CHMFL-EGFR-26 did not exhibit any apparent growth
inhibitory activity against normal Chinese hamster ovary
cells CHO and CHL (GI50: >10 μM), indicating a nongeneral toxicity property.

the PC-9, HCC827 and H3255 cell lines, phosphorylation
of EGFR, AKT and ERK were also dose-dependently
inhibited, which showed the same trend as AZD9291. As
expected, in the EGFR wt expressing NCSCL cell lines
A549 and H1355, only autophosphorylation of EGFR
was affected and none of the downstream mediators was
inhibited. Interestingly, in HCC827 cells, phosphorylation
of STAT3 was significantly inhibited (EC50: < 10 nM) but
this phenomenon was not observed for any other NSCLC
cell lines except that in H1975 cells it was weakly blocked
starting from the concentration of 1μM. In addition, in
H3255 cells, the downstream mediator of mTOR-p70S6K
and eIF4E phosphorylations were completely blocked at
the concentration of 30 nM, which was not observed in
other cell line either. However, in all of the cell lines tested,
AZD9291 significantly affected the phosphorylation of
eIF4E, which presumably was due to its strong inhibitory
activity against MNK2 kinase (IC50: 95 nM) [9].

CHMFL-EGFR-26 induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines
We then examined CHMFL-EGFR-26’s effect on
cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Not surprisingly, in
the drug sensitive cell lines including H1975, HCC827,
PC9 and H3255 which expressed EGFR mutants,
CHMFL-EGFR-26 dramatically blocked cell cycle at G0/
G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner at 24-hour. While
for NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR (A549 and
H1355), CHMFL-EGFR-26 did not cause cell cycle arrest
at concentrations up to 3 μM after 72-hour treatment.
(Figure 3A) CHMFL-EGFR-26 also induced apoptosis
in EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3B). In H1975, HCC827, PC9 and H3255,
30nM concentration of CHMFL-EGFR-26 was sufficient

CHMFL-EGFR-26 inhibited EGFR mediated
signaling pathways in NSCLC cell lines
We next examined the effects of CHMFL-EGFR-26
on EGFR mediated signaling pathways in NSCLC cell
lines with different EGFR mutants. (Figure 2) In the H1975
cell line, 10 nM concentration of the drug could almost
completely suppress the autophosphorylation of EGFR
Y1068. The downstream phosphorylations of AKT on
Thr308, Ser473 and ERK were also inhibited. Similarly, in

treatment. However, in EGFR wt NSCLC cell lines, even
after 72hrs drug treatment, there was no cleaved Caspase-3

lines.

properties in rats (Supplementary Table 5). The half-life
is 0.8 hour by oral dosing which is short but considering
the irreversible binding mode, this short half-life was
preferred [13]. The compound shows good bioavailability
of 33.81%. These results showed that the compound is
suitable for oral administration.
In H1975 cells inoculated xenograft mouse model,
oral administration of CHMFL-EGFR-26 with different
dosages (25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day) did not show any
apparent toxicity. (Figure 4A) It also exhibited dosedependent tumor growth suppression and 100 mg/kg/

the phosphorylation of STAT3 in HCC827 cells (EGFR
del19) but not any other cell lines, even in PC9 cells,
which shares the same EGFR del19 mutant. It has been
reported that upon 24hrs of Erlotinib treatment in NSCLC
cells, phosphorylation of STAT3 level increased in all
the cell lines that express activating EGFR mutants,
except HCC827 which lacks the STAT3 feedback loop,
suggesting the genetic background of HCC827 may be
different in terms of STAT3 signal pathway regulation
[24]. Considering that CHMFL-EGFR-26 has no apparent
inhibitory activity against SRC and JAK1/2, which are the
upstream mediators of STAT3, there must be some other
factors contributing to this inhibition and are worth further
study [25].
In addition, among all of the EGFR mutants and
wt NSCLC cell lines tested, CHMFL-EGFR-26 only
inhibited the phosphorylations of eIF4E and p70S6K in
H3255 cell line which expressed EGFR L858R mutant.
Due to its potent inhibitory activity to the MNK2, which
is the upstream mediator of eIF4E, AZD9291 inhibited
the phosphorylation of eIF4E in all of the cell lines tested.
However, CHMFL-EGFR-26 did not exhibit MNK2/
mTOR kinase inhibition in the kinase selectivity profiling
[9], which might it might be due to the different genetic
background or some other non-kinase based targets that
requires further investigation. In addition, it has been
reported that in H1975 cells with high mTOR expression,
Gefitinib did not suppress mTOR activity, but in H3255
which is low mTOR expressed, Gefitinib treatment
inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K which
correlated with the phenomena observed in this work [26].
Furthermore, compared to the clinically used
AZD9291, CHMFL-EGFR-26 requires relatively
larger dosage to achieve the anti-tumor efficacy. One
of the possible reasons is that CHMFL-EGFR-26 bears
a relatively shorter half-life (T1/2: 0.8h) compared to
AZD9291 (T1/2: 3.1 h). Although the shorter half-life of
irreversible inhibitors have been appreciated considering
the possible adverse effect during the circulation in vivo
[13], it may also attenuate the drug’s efficacy if the
exposure time is not enough and some of the drugs have
not been able to form the covalent bond with the target
protein yet. Therefore, further medicinal chemistry
effort to improve the balance of half-life/residence time
associated side effects will be required.
In summary, from the clinically used BTK
kinase inhibitor, Ibrutinib’s core pharmaophore, we
have discovered a novel class of EGFR mutants active
irreversible inhibitor CHMFL-EGFR-26. It displayed
distinct binding mode, proper drug like properties,
potentially better safety window as well as potent in
vitro and in vivo efficacies against EGFR mutants driven
NSCLC preclinical models, which makes it a potential
useful clinical candidate.

DISCUSSION
As the major drug resistant mechanism for the first
line EGFR kinase inhibitors, EGFR T790M mutatioin has
attracted extensive attention from the drug discovery
community [4, 15]. Since the seminal discovery of the
so-called third generation EGFR inhibitors WZ4002 [16],
a number of irreversible inhibitors, such as AZD9291,
CO-1686, HM61713 (The chemical structures are showed
in Supplementary Figure 3), have been developed [9,
10, 17]. However, most of the current EGFR inhibitors
bear a similar aminopyridine pharmacophore and the
chemical scaffold diversity is highly limited [18].
Given the fact that different pharmacophores provide
different drug profiles, ie. drug like property and safety
etc, inhibitors based on new scaffolds are always useful
and supplementary to the current drug library. CHMFLEGFR-26, bearing a novel class of pyrazolopyrimidine
pharmacophore, was developed from the BTK kinase
inhibitor, Ibrutinib, which also exhibited moderate EGFR
T790M mutant activity in the preclinical models, by
trimming off the BTK kinase activity and improving the
EGFR kinase activity, which added one more example
of new drug discovery using “old drug repurposing
approach” [11, 12].
In the clinical trials of CO-1686 and AZD9291,
hyperglycemia has been observed as one of the adverse
events, possibly due to the activity against INSR
and IGF1R kinases either through themselves or the
corresponding metabolites [19–21]. CHMFL-EGFR-26
itself has no apparent activity against these two kinases and
in the preclinical mouse model study no hyperglycemia
phenomenon was observed, which indicated that it might
bear a better therapeutic window for the hyperglycemia.
Furthermore, despite of the similar covalent binding via
cysteine 797 residues in the EGFR kinase with all other
irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitors, CHMFL-EGFR-26
forced the EGFR kinase to adopt a distinct “DFG-incHelix-out” inactive conformation, which is rarely
observed for the EGFR kinase inhibitors [16, 22]. This
might provide a new opportunity for developing the novel
inhibition mechanism based EGFR inhibitors and help to
reveal new enzymatic biology of EGFR kinase.
It has been reported that in the EGFR mutant
driven NSCLCs, STAT3 pathway was activated [23].
Interestingly, we only observed significant inhibition of

MATERIALS AND METHODS

pMSCVpuro (Clontech) backbone. For TEL-fusion
vectors, the first 1 kb of human TEL gene with an
artificial myristoylation sequence (MGCGCSSHPEDD)
was cloned into pMSCVpuro retroviral vector, followed
by a 3xFLAG tag sequence and a stop codon. Then the
kinase domain coding sequences of EGFR variants were
inserted in-frame between TEL and 3xFLAG sequences.
For full-length expression vectors, the coding sequences of
EGFR variants were directly cloned in pMSCVpuro vector
with a 3xFLAG tag at the C-terminal end. All mutations
were performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Retrovirus was made using the same method
described above and was used to infect BaF3 cells. After
puromycin selection, the IL-3 concentration in the medium
was gradually withdrawn until cells were able to grow in
the absence of IL-3.

Inhibitors
AZD9291 was purchased from Haoyuan
Chemexpress Inc; CHMFL-EGFR-26 and CHMFLEGFR-26R were synthesized in the lab, and the synthesis
procedure is described in the supplementary materials.

Cell lines and cell culture
The human cancer cell lines H1975, HCC827,
H2122, CHO, CHL and H1355 were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,
VA, USA). PC9 cell line was purchased from the SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). A549, H3255 were
purchased from Cobioer Biosciences CO., LTD (Nanjing,
China). H1975, PC-9, HCC827 and EGFR mutant
isogenic BaF3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media
(Corning, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. A549 and H1355 were cultured in F-12K
Nutrient Mixture (kaighn's Modification) (Gibco, USA)
with 10% FBS and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine
and 1% pen/strep. H3255 was cultured in BEGM media
(LONZA, USA) with 10% FBS and supplemented with
2% L-glutamine and 1% pen/strep.
We have authenticated the following cell lines
through cell line short tandem repeat (STR) profiling
(GENEWIZ, Suzhou, China): H1975, PC9, H3255,
HCC827, A549, H2122, H1703. All cell lines matched
>90% with lines listed in the ATCC, DSMZ or JCRB Cell
Line Bank STR Profile Information.

Cell proliferation assays
Cells were grown in 96-well culture plates (25003000/well). For adherent cell lines, compounds of various
concentrations were added into the plates after cells were
cultured for 12 hours. Cell proliferation was determined
after treatment with compounds for 72 hours. Cell viability
was measured using the CellTiter–Glo assay (Promega,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and luminescence was measured in a multi-label reader
(Envision, PerkinElmer, USA). Data were normalized
to control groups (DMSO) and represented by the mean
of three independent measurements with standard error
<20%. GI50 values were calculated using Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

proteins without the tag were further purified by sizeexclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) in the wash
buffer. The pure EGFR proteins were concentrated to 15
mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C
for later using.

Washing out experiment

Crystallization and structure determination

H1975, PC9 and H3255 cells were treated with
CHMFL-EGFR-26 (0.01μM, 0.03μM, 0.1μM) for 4 hours
before they were washed out by PBS for three times. Then
cells were incubated in 10% FBS-containing RPMI for
indicated time periods before they were collected and
lysed. EGFR, Phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068) antibody (Cell
signaling Technology) were used for immunoblotting.

The EGFR 696-1022 T790M/CHMFL-EGFR-26
complex crystals were both prepared by co-crystallization
at 20°C using the handing drop vapor diffusion method.
The EGFR proteins were incubated with 1mM compound
on ice for 4 hours before setting-up the crystallization
trays. The reservoir solution for EGFR 696-1022 T790M
CHMFL-EGFR-26 co-crystallization was 0.05M CaCl2,
0.1M B-Tris pH 6.2, 24% PEG 550MME, 5mM TCEP.
For data collection, all crystals were rapidly dipped in
their corresponding reservoir solutions supplemented with
25% ethylene glycol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100K at
beamline BL19U1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation
Facility (SSRF). The diffraction data were processed
using HKL3000 [27]. The structure was determined
by molecular replacement with Phaser [28] utilizing
the EGFR T790M structure (PDB ID 2JIT)[29] as the
search model. Repeated rounds of manual refitting and
crystallographic refinement were done using COOT [30]
and Phenix [30, 31]. The inhibitor was modeled into the
closely fitting positive Fo-Fc electron density and included
in following refinement cycles. Topology and parameter
files for the inhibitor were obtained using PRODRG [32].
The EGFR 696-1022 T790M/ CHMFL-EGFR-26 complex
crystal structure has been deposited in Protein Data Bank
with the accession code 5GTY, respectively. The data
collection and refinement statistics of the structure are
summarized in Supplementary Table 4.

Apoptosis effect examination
H1975, PC9, HCC827 and H3255 cells were treated
with DMSO, CHMFL-EGFR-26 (0.03μM, 0.1μM, 0.3μM
and 1μM) and AZD9291 (1μM) for 24 hours before cells
were harvested. A549 and H1355 cells were treated with
DMSO, CHMFL-EGFR-26 (0.03μM, 0.1μM, 0.3μM
and 1μM) and AZD9291 (1μM) for 72 hours. Cells
were then washed in PBS and lysed in cell lysis buffer.
PARP, Caspase-3,GAPDH antibodies were used for
immunoblotting.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of EGFR
T790M
The EGFR constructs spanning residues 6961022 harboring the T790M mutation were cloned into
the pFastBac HTA vector (Invitrogen). Baculoviruses to
express these proteins were then prepared using the Bacto-Bac Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). A
6xHis-tag followed by a linker peptide containing both
the Thrombin and Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease
cleavage sites was fused to the N-terminal end of the
EGFR proteins. The fusion proteins were then expressed
in the SF9 insect cells.
Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer
containing 20mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 500mM NaCl,
5mM KCl, 20mM imidazole, 1% Glycerol, 1 mM tris(2carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), and
1x protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free,
Roche). The cells were broken by sonication. The lysate
was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for one hour at 4°C, then
the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA Sepharose
beads (GE). The beads were washed with lysis buffer and
eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 400mM
imidazole. The N-terminal 6xHis-tag plus the linker
was removed through incubation with His-tagged TEV
protease for 4 hours at 4 °C. The uncleaved protein and
the His-tagged TEV protease were removed by passing
the mixture through Ni-NTA Sepharose beads and the

H1975 and PC9 xenograft tumor model
Five-week old female nu/nu mice were purchased
from the Shanghai Experimental Center, Chinese Science
Academy (Shanghai, China). All animals were housed
in a specific pathogen-free facility and used according
to the animal care regulations of Hefei Institutes of
Physical Science Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior
to implantation, cells were harvested during exponential
growth. Five million cells in PBS were formulated as a
1:1 mixture with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected
into the subcutaneous space on the right flank of nu/nu
mice. Daily oral administration was initiated when tumors
had reached a size of 200 to 400 mm3. Animals were then
randomized into treatment groups of 5 or 6 mice each for
efficacy studies. CHMFL-EGFR-26 was delivered daily
in a HKI solution (0.5% Methocellulose/0.4% Tween80
in ddH2O) by orally gavage. A range of doses of CHMFLEGFR-26 or its vehicle were administered, as indicated

Immunohistochemistry stain
Tumor tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Six-micron tissue
section were prepared, deparaffinized, dehydrated, and
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using
routine methods. Commercially available primary antibody
to human Ki-67 (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) was used
for Ki-67 staining. After heat-induced antigen retrieval,
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections
were stained with primary antibody overnight at 4°C.
The slides were subsequently incubated with ImmPRES
anti-mouse Ig (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) at room temperature for 30 min, stained with
peroxidase substrate 3,3’-diaminobenzidine chromogen
(Vector Laboratories), and finally counterstained with
hematoxylin. TUNEL staining was assessed using In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (POD) (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
