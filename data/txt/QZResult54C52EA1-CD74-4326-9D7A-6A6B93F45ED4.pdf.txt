Abstract
The transcriptional coactivator AIB1 is an oncogene overexpressed in different types of tumors, including breast cancer.
Although the subcellular compartimentalization of AIB1 seems
to be intimately linked to abnormal proliferation, the
molecular mechanisms that regulate its subcellular distribution are not well defined. Here, we report that the nuclear
accumulation and half-life of AIB1 vary between cancer cell
lines. Using these differences as an experimental model, our
results reveal that alterations to the Akt signaling pathway and
nuclear export determine the stability of AIB1 and nuclear
content of this coactivator. Moreover, our results show that
AIB1 is degraded in the nucleus by the proteasome in an
ubiquitin-dependent manner. However, this process does not
require phosphorylation by GSK3, thereby revealing an alternative mechanism for regulating the turnover of AIB1. We
define a new region at the carboxy terminus of AIB1 that is
required for proteasome-dependent transcriptional activation
and is preceded by a PEST domain that is required for adequate
protein turnover. Based on differences in Akt signaling and
the subcellular distribution of AIB1 between different cell
lines, our results suggest that dysregulation of nuclear shuttling
and proteasomal degradation may modulate the oncogenic
potential of AIB1. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5450–9]

Introduction
Pathways controlling signal transduction, protein turnover, and
transcriptional regulation are frequently altered in human cancers.
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway controls
fundamental aspects of metabolism and cell growth (1). As such,
it also plays a pivotal role in the genesis of several diseases,
including cancer (2). Akt is activated by multiple growth factors
and hormones, but little is known about the regulation of
endogenous Akt in tumor cells.
Protein turnover through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is
also altered in cancers. Ubiquitination is a cellular mechanism that
controls many physiologic processes, including protein half-life,
transcriptional regulation, protein subcellular trafficking, recruitment of binding partners, and reversible allosteric conformations
(3). The transcriptional coactivator AIB1 is a target of the
proteasome and is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway, as well as
by ubiquitin-independent mechanisms (4). AIB1 is overexpressed in
f60% of human cancers (5). However, the high levels of AIB1 can

be explained by amplification of locus 20q in only f5% of these
tumors (6). Hence, other molecular mechanisms must modulate
AIB1 levels via regulation of its transcription and/or protein
stability. Two recent studies suggest that stability of AIB1 depends
on its subcellular localization. However, the results from these
studies are contradictory because one reports that AIB1 is
degraded in the cytosol by the proteasome (7) whereas the other
describes nuclear degradation by the proteasome (8). As a
transcriptional regulator, AIB1 exerts its activity in the nucleus.
Interestingly, nuclear staining for AIB1 is detected in the highly
proliferative cell layer of the mammary gland (9). Furthermore,
nuclear accumulation of AIB1 occurs during S phase of the cell
cycle (10), suggesting a role for AIB1 during or after S phase,
although it may also exert an important function during G1
progression by coactivating E2F1 (11, 12) and promoting the
transcription of cyclin D1 (13).
Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the nuclear
shuttling of AIB1. Phosphorylation of AIB1 by Erk has been shown
to promote its nuclear localization and interaction with nuclear
receptors (14), as well as with p300 (15). InB kinase (IKK),
responsible for the degradation of InB and subsequent activation of
nuclear factor-nB, phosphorylates AIB1, permitting its translocation to the nucleus (16). This translocation is Ran-dependent and
mediated by importin a3 (17). The SRC-interacting protein (SIP)
sequesters AIB1 in the cytosol until phosphorylation by casein
kinase II (CKII) releases AIB1 from this interaction (18). The PI3K/
Akt pathway is also involved in the activation of IKK (19, 20),
suggesting that PI3K/Akt pathway, when altered in cancer
cells, could also modulate AIB1 nuclear shuttling and stability and,
hence, its oncogenic potential. Interestingly, AIB1-deficient mice
display altered regulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)
expression in specific tissues (21) whereas AIB1 overexpression in
transgenic animals enhances IGF-I expression, thereby increasing
Akt signaling (22). Furthermore, AIB1 is recruited to the target
promoters of IRS-2 and IGF-I (23), suggesting a feedback loop
between AIB1 stability/activity and IGF-I/Akt increased signaling.
Importantly, the function of AIB1 in IGF-I–induced proliferation,
signaling, cell survival, and gene expression seems to be
independent of its role in estrogen receptor signaling (24). GSK3,
another downstream target of Akt, phosphorylates AIB1, allowing
the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase SCFFbw7a (25).
With the present study, we provide evidence that nuclear
localization explains the observed differences in the stability of
AIB1 between certain cancer cell lines. Moreover, these differences
in nuclear content of AIB1 reflect differences in the regulation of
nuclear export rather than alterations to import molecules.
Although nuclear localization is the major determinant of the
half-life of AIB1, Akt activation counteracts the degradation of
AIB1, thereby increasing its half-life. Additionally, our results show
that estrogen receptor activity destabilizes AIB1, suggesting that
multiple pathways may modulate the subcellular localization and

stability of AIB1. We also identify two new domains, distinct from
the known GSK3 phosphorylation site, that are required for
ubiquitination and for proteasome-efficient transcriptional activation. Therefore, our results reveal a new mechanism for regulating
the stability of the coactivator AIB1 and may provide unique
insights into how subcellular localization of this molecule
modulates various physiologic and pathologic processes, including
the development of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfections, and treatments. All cell lines were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine LTX reagent (Invitrogen)
according to company specifications. For estrogen depletion ( E2), MCF-7

cells were seeded in DMEM phenol red–free medium for 10 d and split
when required to a final 80% confluence. The medium also included 10%
charcoal and dextran-treated FBS (HyClone) to remove estrogens and
glucocorticoids. Cells were treated with leptomycin B (10 ng/mL) and/or
MG132 (20 Amol/L; Calbiochem) for 17 h. Epoxomicin treatment (20 Amol/L;
Sigma) was also done for 17 h. E36-ts20 cells were grown at 32jC or heat
shocked at 42jC for 30 min and then grown at 39jC overnight.
Paraffin embedding and immunostaining. Subconfluent growing cells
were trypsinized, pelleted, and fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min at room
temperature. After serial dehydration, cells were in paraffin by standard
procedures. Sections of 5 Am thickness were processed for immunohistochemistry analysis after antigen retrieval.
In vivo cell labeling. Cells (2  106) were seeded on 6-cm Petri dish.
Treatment with cyclosporin A 5 Amol/L (Sigma), a calcineurin inhibitor that
arrests cells in G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, was performed for 16 h before
radioactive pulse and maintained with this inhibitor throughout the time

Figure 1. The subcellular distribution of AIB1 differs between cancer cell lines and correlates with its half-life. A, exponentially growing cells (80% confluence)
were fixed and stained with anti-AIB1 antibodies. Sections were subsequently counterstained with hematoxilin. B, in parallel, cells were lysed and fractionated to
obtain nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts that were analyzed by Western blotting with AIB1 antibodies. The Western blot is representative of five independent subcellular
fractionations. C, a pulse-chase experiment was performed to determine AIB1 half-life. Subconfluent cultures were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and
were lysed at the indicated times. Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AIB1 antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled AIB1 was quantified
using a PhosphorImager. Images shown are representative of three independent experiments. Protein half-life (t 1/2) was measured by semilogarithmic linear
regression. Bottom, Western blot for AIB1 of MCF-7 cells treated with 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide (CHX ) for the indicated times before the preparation of cytosol (C)
and nuclear (N ) fractions. D, AIB1 half-life in MCF-7 cells is also modulated by estrogen receptor activity. Estradiol or the estrogen receptor antagonists ICI and
tamoxifen were added at time 0 (Materials and Methods). Cyclosporin A was added to subconfluent cultures 16 h before the pulse and chase experiment. Western
blotting (right ) confirmed cyclosporin A–mediated cell cycle arrest based on the loss of cyclin A expression which correlated with higher cytosolic AIB1 content.

course of the experiment. The following day, cells were washed twice and
labeled in DMEM without L-methionine and L-cysteine (Invitrogen 21013024) plus 50 ACi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (GE) for 2 h. Labeling media
was then substituted with regular growing media or media containing
either 10 nmol/L 17h-estradiol, 10 Amol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma), or
1 Amol/L ICI 182780 (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals). Cells were subsequently lysed at the indicated times. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with
anti-AIB1 antibodies and run on a SDS-PAGE gel. Gel was fixed and
incubated with enhancer solution (EN3HANCE, NEN) for 1 h before being
dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen.
Antibodies. Antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal anti-AIB1 (BD);
polyclonal anti-AIB1 (generated in our laboratory and used for immunoprecipitations); monoclonal anti-HA (Covance); monoclonal h-tubulin
(D-10), polyclonal cyclin A (596), monoclonal Gal4–DNA-binding domain
(Gal4-DBD; 510), and monoclonal Lamin A/C (636) from Santa Cruz Biotech;
monoclonal h-actin (ac-15, Sigma); and monoclonal Akt and phosphorylated
Akt (Ser473) from Cell Signaling.
Real-time PCR. Isolated RNA (TRIzol, Invitrogen) from cells was digested
with DNase followed by purification through QIAGEN columns (RNeasy kit).
Subsequently, the RT reaction (Superscript, Invitrogen) was done with 1 Ag
of total RNA and oligo dT. Real-time PCR was performed with 10 ng of cDNA
with 5AGCCAGGAGGTGGTGGAGAC3 and 5CTCGGCCTGTGCTCTTCTCA3
SIP, 5ATAAGGGGGATTTTGGCACTCA3 and 5CTCCAGCCCTCCACATTCTTCT3 importin a3, 5ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC3¶ and
5¶TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA3¶ GAPDH.
Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting. Subcellular fractionations were performed with a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit (MBL, JM-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

K266) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Conventional lysates
were done with commercial lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with
protease cocktail inhibitors (Roche), up to 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
AEBSF (Roche), and 1 mmol/L NaF. Lysis buffer was supplemented with
5 mmol/L N-ethylmaleimide (SIGMA) and 5 nmol/L ubiquitin aldehyde
(Sta. Cruz Biotech) in ubiquitination experiments. Immunoprecipitations
with AIB1 or HA antibodies were carried out overnight and immunocomplexes were washed four times before SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred
to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and blotted with the indicated
antibodies.

Results
Differences in subcellular distribution and stability of AIB1
in various cancer cell lines. To study the mechanisms which
regulate the subcellular distribution and degradation of AIB1, we
used immunohistochemistry to compare the expression of AIB1 in
the cervical cancer cell line HeLa with the breast cancer cell line
MCF-7. Whereas the distribution of AIB1 was more cytosolic in
HeLa cells, prominent nuclear staining was observed in MCF-7
cells (Fig. 1A). This difference in the distribution of AIB1 between
HeLa and MCF-7 cells was further confirmed by Western blot
analysis of subcellular fractions (Fig. 1B). Similar results have been
previously reported by Western blotting (26). In other cancer cell
lines (H1299, A549, BT-474), AIB1 was detected predominantly in
the cytosolic fraction similar to HeLa or predominantly in the

nucleus as observed for the MCF-7 cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and data not shown), suggesting that nuclear accumulation of AIB1 may represent a fundamental biological difference
between cell lines and, hence, may reflect alterations in the
shuttling and/or turnover of AIB1. Given that recent studies have
reported seemingly contradictory results as to whether AIB1 is
degraded by the proteosome in the cytosol (7) or the nucleus (8),
we sought to determine the degradation locus in our biological
models. Because cytoplasmic content of AIB1 is higher in HeLa
cells, a mechanism involving nuclear degradation would be
consistent with a greater AIB1 stability in this cell line. Pulsechase experiments revealed that the half-life of AIB1 was >9 hours
in HeLa cells, whereas it was only slightly more than an hour in
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with H1299
and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, treatment
with cycloheximide to prevent the appearance of newly synthesized protein diminished only the nuclear pool of AIB1 (Fig. 1C,
bottom). When MCF-7 cells were arrested with the inhibitor
cyclosporin A, cytosolic content of AIB1 and its half-life were
increased (Fig. 1D, right and graph), demonstrating that subcellular distribution is a critical determinant of AIB1 half-life.
Interestingly, the cellular levels of AIB1 were also influenced by
estrogen receptor activity because treatment of MCF-7 cells with
estradiol shortened the half-life of AIB1. Conversely, exposure to
ER antagonists (ICI, tamoxifen) extended the stability of AIB1
(Fig. 1D), but these agents did not alter the subcellular compartmentalization of AIB1 (data not shown). Thus, the expression
levels and activity of the ER represent an additional mechanism
for modulating the half-life of AIB1. The significant differences in
AIB1 turnover together with the cell line–specific subcellular

distribution of AIB1 suggest that the nucleus may serve as the
principal site for degradation of this coactivator.
Effects of inhibitors of nuclear export and the proteasome
on the nuclear content of AIB1. To further explore the nuclear
degradation of AIB1, we treated cells with leptomycin B, a specific
inhibitor of the nuclear export factor CRM1. In both HeLa and
MCF-7 cells, this inhibitor caused a notable decrease in AIB1 levels
(Fig. 2A, line 2), presumably because AIB1 is trapped within the
nucleus and, thus, is more accessible to mechanisms mediating its
degradation. This effect was more striking in MCF-7 cells, probably
due to the shorter half-life of AIB1 in this cell line. Immunofluorescence studies further confirmed the enhanced nuclear
localization of AIB1 in both cell lines after inhibitor treatment
(Fig. 2B, line 2). As expected, treatment of cells with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 greatly increased the levels of AIB1
as detected by Western blotting. However, when cells were
coincubated with both inhibitors, MG132 potently prevented the
leptomycin B–mediated reduction of AIB1 levels (Fig. 2A and B,
lane 4), further demonstrating that nuclear accumulation of AIB1
coincides with degradation by the proteasome. Although leptomycin B reduced AIB1 levels in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3
and 4), this effect is unlikely to be at the level of stabilization but
may rather reflect a decrease in protein translation as leptomycin
blocks nuclear export of mRNAs. However, the degradation of AIB1
is presumably mediated by the proteasome because, otherwise,
treatment with leptomycin alone or in combination with MG132
(lanes 2 and 4) would yield the same result. Taken all together,
these results implicate a nuclear mechanism in the degradation of
AIB1 by the proteasome and suggest that this may be avoided in
HeLa cells by a higher rate of nuclear export of AIB1.

Figure 3. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway degrades AIB1 in the nucleus of E36-ts20 cells. A, the thermosensitive cell line E36-ts20 was grown either at 32jC
or at the nonpermissive temperature 39jC. The E1 ubiquitin ligase was transfected into these cells, and a stable clone was obtained (E36-ts20 + E1 ). Western
blot analysis was performed to determine AIB1 levels, using anti–h-tubulin antibodies to control protein load. B, subcellular fractionation of E36-ts20 control cells
( E1) or transfected with E1 (+E1) and grown at the nonpermissive temperature 39jC reveals accumulation of AIB1 in the nucleus in the absence of E1 and
degradation in the nucleus when E1 is expressed. Antibodies against Lamin A/C and Akt were used to assess cross-contamination of fractions. C, immunofluorescence
with AIB1 antibodies and nuclear staining with DAPI confirms increasing intensity and accumulation in the nucleus of E36-ts20 cells when grown at the
nonpermissive temperature.

Figure 4. Differences in Akt signaling
correlate with AIB1 stability. A, RNA was
isolated from subconfluent MCF-7 and
HeLa cells and used to analyze the
expression of SIP (left graph ) and importin
a3 (right graph ) by real-time PCR. B,
subconfluent cultures were maintained
under normal conditions (C) or deprived
of serum overnight ( FBS ). Lysates were
prepared and analyzed by Western
blotting with the indicated antibodies. C,
proliferating MCF-7 cells were treated
with 50 Amol/L LY294002 for 6 h (LY) or
with vehicle alone (C ). Cell lysates were
subjected to Western blotting analysis
using the indicated antibodies. HeLa cells
were transfected with empty vector (C )
or with pCMV HA-Akt(E40K), a soluble
activated form of Akt. Two days
posttransfection, cells were lysed and
subjected to Western blot analysis with
the indicated antibodies. D, subcellular
fractions were prepared from MCF-7 cells
treated with LY for the indicated times
and analyzed by Western blot to detect
AIB1 levels (left ). LY efficiently blocked
Akt activation as determined by analysis
with phosphorylated Akt antibodies.
Total Akt and Lamin A/C were used
as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers.
In parallel, transcription of endogenous
AIB1 was assessed by semiquantitative
RT-PCR (right ) in untreated (C ) and
50 Amol/L LY294002 (LY)–treated cells.
Intensity of the bands was quantified using
Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) and
normalized to GAPDH levels as a
house-keeping gene (bottom columns ).

Proteasomal degradation of AIB1 in the nucleus requires
ubiquitination. Some proportion of AIB1 proteasomal turnover
occurs in an energy and ubiquitin-independent manner (4).
Therefore, we sought to define the role of ubiquitination in the
observed nuclear degradation of AIB1 by the proteasome pathway.
In the thermosensitive cell line E36 (E36-ts20), the ubiquitinactivating enzyme E1 is inactive when cells are grown at 39jC, thus
representing a tool for studying the absence of protein ubiquitination. At the nonpermissive temperature (39jC), nuclear content
of AIB1 was higher in E36-ts20 cells (Fig. 3A, line 2) than when cells
were cultured at the permissive temperature of 32jC (Fig. 3A, line 1).
Moreover, when cells were transfected with functional E1 (E36ts20 + E1) and grown at 39jC, levels of AIB1 were similar to those
observed at the permissive temperature of 32jC (Fig. 3A, line 3), an
important control to show that the observed alterations in AIB1
levels are related directly to the ubiquitination process and not to
some indirect effect of temperature in this thermosensitive line. In
the absence of ubiquitination, AIB1 accumulated in the nucleus
(Fig. 3B and C). These results strongly suggest that degradation of
AIB1 mainly occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
and that this requires ubiquitination within the nucleus.

Akt signaling favors AIB1 stability. We next focused on
investigating the mechanisms that may differentially regulate the
stability and shuttling of AIB1 in MCF-7 versus HeLa cells. A recent
report has shown that the SIP recruits and retains SRC proteins in
the cytoplasm (18). We reasoned that differences in the expression
levels of SIP might explain the differences in AIB1-nuclear content
observed between these two cell lines. However, no significant
differences were detected when SIP levels were analyzed by reverse
transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) in both HeLa and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A,
left graph). Importin a3 has also been implicated in AIB1 nuclear
transport (8). We also assessed levels of importin a3 mRNA but
did not observe significant differences between these two cell lines
(Fig. 4A, right graph).
AIB1 is phosphorylated by the IKK complex in response to
tumor necrosis factor a, resulting in enhanced transcriptional
activity (16). IKK is also a target of Akt, and thus, we evaluated
whether alterations to Akt signaling might explain differences in
AIB1 stability and transcriptional activity between MCF-7 and
HeLa cells. As would be expected, serum depletion ( FBS) in HeLa
cells reduced the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4B). This reduction
coincided with a decrease of AIB1 levels. Surprisingly, serum

withdrawal in MCF-7 cells produced no such effect on Akt
phosphorylation; the levels of phosphorylated Akt were still
significantly higher than in HeLa cells after serum withdrawal
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that Akt may be more active in the MCF-7
cell line. Furthermore, depletion of estrogen in cultures of MCF-7
cells reduced proliferation and cyclin A expression (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). However, even under these growth-restricting conditions,
the levels of phosphorylated Akt remained much higher than those
observed in nonproliferating HeLa cells. It is important to note that
both the levels of total Akt, as well as phosphorylated Akt, were
higher in MCF-7 than in HeLa cells, and the expression of AIB1 was
moderately, but reproducibly, increased by either serum or estrogen
deprivation in the MCF-7 line (Fig. 4B and Supplementary S2A). In
contrast, serum withdrawal reduced AIB1 expression in HeLa cells,
coincident with a reduction in Akt phosphorylation levels and
proliferative markers (Fig. 4B and Supplementary S2A). Similar
results were also observed with A549 and H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These observations show that, in the absence of
proliferation, AIB1 levels were slightly increased in MCF-7 cells.

Moreover, these studies reveal substantial differences in Akt
signaling between HeLa and MCF-7 cells and suggest that this
pathway may be involved in the regulation of AIB1 stability/
activity.
To further test the hypothesis that Akt modulates AIB1
degradation, we used LY294002, a potent and specific PI3K
inhibitor, to block Akt activation. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with
LY294002 abolished phosphorylation of Akt and produced a
reduction of AIB1 levels (Fig. 4D, left). LY294002 treatment did
not alter AIB1 RNA levels (Fig. 4D, right). Subcellular fractionation
revealed that the LY294002 treatment induced a reduction of AIB1
levels in the nucleus, but not in the cytosol (Fig. 4D, right lanes in
the left panels). Conversely, ectopic expression of a soluble,
constitutively active form of Akt (E40K) in HeLa cells increased
AIB1 levels (Fig. 4C, right). These results support a role of Akt in
AIB1 stabilization. Importantly, treatment with LY294002 did not
alter Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 4C, left) suggesting that the
observed Akt effects on AIB1 stability are independent of Erk
activation (14, 15).

independently of GSK3. A, MCF-7 and HeLa
cells were transiently transfected with the indicated
AIB1 fragments fused to the Gal4-DBD together
with a luciferase reporter. Two days after the
transfection, cells were left untreated (open bars )
or treated (hatched bars ) with 50 Amol/L LY294002
at 6 h. Subsequently, cells were lysed and
luciferase activity was measured and normalized
to luciferase values obtained with the Gal4-DBD
empty vector alone. Gal4 DBD fused in frame to
the VP16 activation domain was also used as a
control (GD-VP16 ). In contrast to AIB1 fragments,
VP16 activity increased upon LY294002 treatment:
MCF-7 (GD-VP16 = 564 F 22; GD-VP16 + LY =
2466 F 57); HeLa (GD-VP16 = 319 F 6;
GD-VP16 = 2565 F 47). NLS, nuclear localization
signal; LXXLL Motifs, interaction with transcription
factors and other coactivators. B, in parallel,
transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot
analysis for expression of Gal4-DBD AIB1
(556-1424), revealing that treatment with
LY294002 (LY), results in reduced protein levels.
C, loss of stability of ectopically expressed
Gal4-DBD AIB1 (556-1424) protein by inhibition

with 10 Ag/mL of cycloheximide (CHX ) 2 d
posttransfection. Treatment was performed for
the indicated times in the absence (C ) or presence
(+LY) of PI3K inhibitor. Without de novo protein
synthesis, Gal4-DBD hybrid was more unstable
in the presence of LY294002.

Figure 6. Two distinct domains at the carboxy terminus of AIB1 mediate sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors and binding to ubiquitin. A, the indicated fragments of
AIB1 were fused to the Gal4-DBD and transiently transfected into COS cells together with a luciferase reporter under the Gal4-responsive element. Cells were left

for 6 h, as indicated. Cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies, followed by Western blotting with Gal4-DBD antibodies (right ).

were transiently expressed in COS cells. Two days posttransfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX ) and cultures were lysed at the indicated times.
Gal4-DBD antibodies were used to detect the levels of hybrid protein. In parallel, cells were also treated with MG132 to inhibit proteasomal degradation.

Regulation of AIB1 activity and stability by Akt occurs
independently of GSK3. Two residues in the amino terminus of
AIB1 (K17 and R18) are essential for its nuclear localization (8).
To evaluate the role of Akt in modulating AIB1 activity independently of nuclear shuttling, we generated two fragments of AIB1

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

fused to the Gal4-DBD harboring a nuclear localization signal. One
construct contained full-length AIB1 (amino acids 1–1424) and the

PI3K/AKT Signaling Can Promote AIB1 Stability

treatment with LY294002 inhibited AIB1 transcriptional activity in
both MCF-7 and HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, the activity of
the fragment lacking the phosphorylation site for GSK3 was also
regulated by Akt signaling pathway (see scheme and results in
Fig. 5A), suggesting the existence of a regulatory mechanism
distinct from the one previously reported for GSK3 (25). To further
correlate transcriptional activity with protein levels, we analyzed
ectopic expression of AIB1 fragment (556-1424) by Western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 5B , this fragment lacking the
phosphorylation site for GSK3 was less stable when PI3K/Akt
was inhibited by LY294002. Furthermore, protein stability, as
determined by cycloheximide treatment to prevent de novo protein
synthesis, was significantly diminished in both cell lines when PI3K
signaling was inhibited (Fig. 5C). Similar results were also obtained
using the Akt specific inhibitor Triciribine (Supplementary Fig. S3).
These results suggest that PI3K/Akt signaling is important for
conferring stability of AIB1 protein.
Two domains in the carboxy terminus of AIB1 are
concomitantly required for efficient proteasome-dependent
transcriptional activation. To investigate the potential role of
GSK3 phosphorylation in AIB1-mediated transcription, we generated various fragments of AIB1 fused to the Gal4-DBD. Individual
constructs were cotransfected into COS cells together with the
luciferase gene under the Gal4-responsive element. Treatment with
the inhibitor MG132 or epoxomicin, a more specific inhibitor of the
proteasome, potently enhanced the transcriptional activity of those
fragments containing the carboxyl-half of AIB1 (Fig. 6A). Importantly, these fragments did not contain S505 and S509, which
participate in GSK3/Fbw7a-mediated ubiquitination (25), suggesting that other ubiquitin ligase may also be involved in AIB1
ubiquitination. However, the DI domain (amino acids 673–979;
Fig. 6A) containing the two lysines reported to be ubiquitinated by
Fbw7a was required, but not sufficient, to mediate the sensitivity
to proteasomal inhibitors. Another domain, DII (1133–1424),
together with DI, was necessary for the effects induced by
MG132 or epoxomicin. Emerging evidences suggest a role for the
ubiquitin-proteasome system in the transcriptional activation of
genes (27, 28). These results suggest that the DI and DII domains of
AIB1 are concomitantly required for efficient proteasome-mediated
transcriptional activation. A potential caveat to the interpretation
of these experiments is the possibility that some of these
ectopically expressed fusion proteins were not localized to the
nucleus. However, the fact that they display potent transcriptional
activity is consistent with nuclear localization. Furthermore,
nuclear staining of these domains of AIB1 was verified by
immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, these observations strongly suggest that the carboxy terminus of AIB1 contains
the structural information needed for the proper regulation of
AIB1-mediated transcription by the proteasome.
The DI and DII domains are both ubiquitinated independently of GSK3 phosphorylation and are differentially stabilized by Akt. GSK3 couples AIB1 phosphorylation to
ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFFbw7a. To further
study the role of Akt in the stabilization of AIB1, we analyzed
ubiquitination of the AIB1 fragments devoid of the GSK3
phosphorylation site in response to the Akt inhibitor Triciribine.
Treatment with this inhibitor potently reduced ubiquitination
levels in all DI-containing fragments, but not in the DII fragment
alone (Fig. 6B; compare lane 2 without inhibitor to lane 4 with
Triciribine). This reduction in ubiquitination levels was due to
increased degradation since inhibition of the proteasome restored,

www.aacrjournals.org

at least in part, ubiquitination of the DI-containing fragments
(Fig. 6B, lane 5 treated with both inhibitors). Moreover, treatment
with Triciribine reduced the levels of these mutant proteins as
detected in total cell lysates (Fig. 6B, extreme right). These results
reveal a role for Akt in the stabilization of fragment DI.
Additionally, we show that the ubiquitination of DII, in contrast
to DI, is rather stable (Fig. 6B and C). Sequence analysis of AIB1
revealed a third potential ubiquitination site in lysine 1194, located
precisely within the DII domain. A shorter version of DII lacking
K1194 was not ubiquitinated (Fig. 6B). It is not clear whether the
absence of a ladder reflects increased susceptibility of these
fragments to deubiquitinases in contrast to the full-length AIB1 or
whether, alternatively, polyubiquitination may require other
structural information present only in the full-length molecule.
The PEST-containing domain preceding the DI and DII
domains is required to destabilize AIB1 protein. To further
study the role of DI and DII domains in AIB1 turnover, we
performed a time course experiment wherein cycloheximide was
added to the cultures to prevent de novo synthesis of proteins.
AIB1 contains a PEST domain (647–672) typically involved in
protein degradation; however, deletion of this domain had no
effect on the activity of AIB1 (Fig. 6A). Analysis of protein stability
revealed that only those fragments containing the PEST region
were unstable in the absence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 6C).
However, treatment with MG132 potently induced the accumulation of these highly unstable fragments (Fig. 6C, fragments
556–1424 and 578–1131). These findings reveal a previously
unrecognized role for the PEST domain of AIB1 in mediating
the proteasomal degradation of this coactivator. In contrast,
fragment DII, although ubiquitinated, was stable (Fig. 6B and C),
thus implicating the DII domain in proteasome-mediated
transcriptional activation but not in degradation.

Discussion
In the present study, we report that nuclear content of AIB1
varies between cancer cell lines and these differences in subcellular
distribution correlate with striking differences in the half-life of this
oncogenic molecule. Additionally, we show that sustained phosphorylation of Akt profoundly influences AIB1 stability and
transcriptional activity, independently of the known mechanism
involving GSK3 phosphorylation (25). As a transcriptional coactivator, AIB1 exerts its major function in the nucleus; here, we
confirm that the majority of AIB1 is degraded by the proteasome
also in the nucleus. Interestingly, in the quiescent noncancerous
epithelial cells of mammary ducts, AIB1 is localized to the
cytoplasm whereas very strong nuclear staining has been observed
in proliferating cells of the same structures (10). Our data suggest
that overexpression of AIB1 alone might not be sufficient to trigger
neoplastic changes but that alterations to other pathways (i.e., Akt
signaling, nuclear shuttling, and proteasomal degradation) are
required to produce the tumors associated with AIB1. Consistent
with this idea, tumor development in transgenic mice overexpressing AIB1 is not observed until at least at 8 months of age,
which is much later than the effects of other oncogenes that have
been overexpressed in animal models (22). One possible explanation for this stepwise development of cancer is that aging or
environmental factors produce other alterations that function in
synergy with the overexpression of AIB1. The PI3K/Akt pathway is
frequently altered in cancers, and hence, it may play a pivotal role
in AIB1-mediated oncogenesis.

Cancer Research

We did not detect differences in the expression of SIP and
importin a3, two molecules directly implicated in AIB1 nuclear
transport, between MCF-7 and HeLa cells. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that cell line–specific differences may exist
for regulating the activation level of these molecules. Although we
have focused on the observed differences in Akt activation, CKII
may also play a role in the modulation of AIB1 degradation, given
that Akt and ERa are substrates of CKII (18, 29). Phosphorylation of
SIP by CKII in its PEST domain releases AIB1 from the interaction
in the cytosol (18). However, CKII activity alone cannot explain the
differences we observe in activity and stabilization of AIB1
fragments lacking the NH2 terminal region that mediates the
interaction with SIP (Fig. 6).
Our results show that the half-life of AIB1 is shorter in MCF-7
than in HeLa cells. By blocking nuclear export with LMB and
inhibiting the proteasome with MG132 (Fig. 2), our studies reveal
that turnover of AIB1 occurs in the nucleus in both cell lines and
suggest that nuclear export of AIB1 is more active in HeLa cells
because higher levels of this coactivator were observed in the
cytoplasm of this cell line in the absence of inhibitors. This
cytosolic localization may explain the longer half-life of AIB1 which
we observed in HeLa cells, although other alterations, such as ERa
expression may also contribute to AIB1 stability (Fig. 1D; ref. 30).
MCF-7 cells display unusually high levels of activated Akt. Serum
withdrawal is much less effective at reducing phosphorylated Akt
levels in MCF-7 cells compared with the effects on HeLa cells.
Furthermore, prolonged estrogen depletion can effectively cause
growth arrest in MCF-7 cells without significantly reducing
phosphorylated Akt levels. This sustained activation of Akt is most
likely due to the high levels of total Akt expressed by MCF-7 cells
compared with HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). Overexpression of AIB1 itself
may also play a role in these observations because its ablation in
mice reduces the expression of upstream signaling molecules, such
as IGF-IR and IRS proteins, which in turn diminish the activation of
Akt upon IGF stimulation (24). However, other mechanisms specific
to MCF-7 cells may account for the observed dysregulation of Akt
because the cell line A549 also overexpresses AIB1 but Akt
activation is comparatively normal (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Our
data ( fragment 556–1424; Figs. 5 and 6D) suggest the existence of
an additional or alternative mechanism for regulating the
proteasomal degradation of AIB1, which is distinct from that
involving GSK3 phosphorylation and targeting to Fbw7a (25).
We have identified two new domains that are concomitantly
required for proteasome-dependent transcriptional activation of
AIB1 independently of the GSK3 phosphorylation site. Both DI and
DII domains are subject to ubiquitination (Fig. 6B). We also
cotransfected fragments DI and DII to test whether the combined
presence of these two independent proteins could restore
transcriptional efficiency to the proteasome. However, as independent fragments, these domains were not able to reconstitute
sensitivity as was observed for the clone expressing both domains
in tandem (data not shown), perhaps owing to a loss of structure or
adequate orientation. One possible explanation is that efficient

proteasome-mediated transcriptional activation requires the presence of all three ubiquitination sites.
In contrast to the PEST-DI domains, DII ubiquitination is not
required for the degradation of AIB1 by the proteasome (Fig. 6B
and C; ref. 25). Furthermore, we found that only PEST-DI domains
are stabilized by Akt. One plausible explanation is that Akt inhibits
DI ubiquitination as has been described for other molecules, such
as MDM2, XIAP, and cyclin D2 (31–33). A recent publication
documents the stabilization of AIB1 by PKC~ (34). PKC~ is a known
substrate of PI3K/PDK1 signaling pathway (35). Our data are
distinct but complementary to this new report, as they provide an
alternative mechanism mediated by Akt, another effector of PDK1,
whereby AIB1 is stabilized through its PEST-DI domains.
Our results suggest that the oncogenic potential of AIB1 is likely to
be modulated by various pathways that function to determine its
subcellular localization and thereby its susceptibility to proteasome
degradation. One of our present aims is to identify mutations in
human AIB1 that render it insensitive to degradation by the
proteasome. These mutations are of most interest for the role they
may play in modulating the oncogenic potential of overexpressed
AIB1. On the one hand, certain genetic and/or environmental signals
are required to trigger overexpression of AIB1. One mechanism,
which has been associated with overexpression of AIB1, is
chromosomal amplification, but this has been observed in only
f5% of the human tumors bearing high levels of AIB1. Thus, other
mechanisms must modulate the cellular levels of AIB1; for example,
mutations in the degradation domains (PEST-DI) or in the domains
required for proteasome-mediated coactivation (DI and DII) would
be expected to block degradation or full activation of AIB1 and,
thereby, altering its oncogenic potential. Additionally, the participation of AIB1 in abnormal cellular growth may involve alterations to
its subcellular localization, which directly or indirectly affect its
transcriptional activity in the nucleus. The Akt pathway is quite
likely to be involved in these processes because our results clearly
link sustained phosphorylation of Akt with increased stability/
activity of AIB1 in cancer cells. Thus, when increased expression of
AIB1 coincides with another molecular anomaly that promotes its
activation/stabilization, this coactivator may function as a potent
oncogene by promoting cell proliferation and tumor development.
