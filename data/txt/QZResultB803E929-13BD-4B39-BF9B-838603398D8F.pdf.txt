ABSTRACT
Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have been shown to contribute to tumor
growth, metastasis, and recurrence. They are also markedly resistant to conventional
cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation. Recent studies have
suggested that hypoxia is one of the prominent micro-environmental factors that
increase the self-renewal ability of BCSCs, partially by enhancing CSC phenotypes.
Thus, the identification and development of new therapeutic approaches based on
targeting the hypoxia-dependent responses in BCSCs is urgent. Through various
in vitro studies, we found that hypoxia specifically up-regulates BCSC sphere
formation and a subset of CD44+/CD24−/low CSCs. Hypoxia inducible factors 2α (HIF2α)
depletion suppressed CSC-like phenotypes and CSC-mediated drug resistance in
breast cancer. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of hypoxia-induced HIF2α on
BCSC sphere formation were successfully attenuated by epidermal growth factorcontaining fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) knockdown. Taken
together, these data suggest that HIF2α mediates hypoxia-induced cancer growth/
metastasis and that EFEMP1 is a downstream effector of hypoxia-induced HIF2α
during breast tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION

cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to
tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence [4]. Importantly,
CSCs have been shown to be resistant to conventional
therapies, such as chemotherapy [5] and radiation [6].
Furthermore, it has been reported that hypoxia increases
the CSC subpopulations and promotes the acquisition of a
CSC- like phenotype [7], thereby aggravating the patient’s
prognosis. Therefore, these stimulatory effects of hypoxia
on tumorigenesis prompted us to investigate the potential
mechanisms by which hypoxia stimulate the tumorigenic
properties of CSCs.
Cancer cells have regulatory mechanisms to
quickly respond to changes in oxygen tension within
cells/tissues using the transcription factor known as
hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). The HIFs, which are

Local oxygen (O2) concentrations can directly
influence the differentiation or self-renewal capacity
of stem cells. Recent in vitro evidence indicates that
hypoxia, defined as reduced oxygen tension, promotes an
undifferentiated and multipotent status in human embryonic
[1] and adult [2] stem cells. Although it is certainly a
valid generalization that severe or prolonged hypoxia is
generally toxic for both normal and tumor tissues, cancer
cells gradually adapt to chronic hypoxia though positive or
negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors with a net
result that hypoxia strongly promotes poor patient survival,
therapeutic resistance and an aggressive tumor phenotype
[3]. Recently, it was suggested that a subset of tumor

heterodimer molecules consisting of an alpha subunit
and a beta subunit, have been recognized as the master
regulators of hypoxia-induced changes [8]. Though
HIF1α and HIF2α share a high degree of sequence
homology, most studies investigating the mechanisms
of hypoxia-induced effects have been focused on HIF1α
largely due to its earlier discovery and more ubiquitous
expression pattern in tissues compared with HIF2α, which
demonstrates more restricted expression [9]. However,
recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that HIF2α
is only significantly present in the CSC subpopulation [10]
and promotes tumor proliferation and radiation resistance
[11, 12]. Furthermore, Pahlman and his colleagues
demonstrated that the high expression of HIF2α correlates
with immature phenotypic features and poor outcome in
patients undergoing brain tumor surgery [13]. Moreover,
hypoxia-induced HIF2α can increase the expression of
stem cell-related markers and confer tumorigenic potential
to non-CSCs of human brain cancers [14]. Intriguingly,
recent advances in cancer research have revealed that
hypoxia-induced HIF2α, but not HIF1α, promotes
hypoxic cell proliferation by enhancing the expression of
Oct4 [15] and the transcriptional activity of c-Myc [11].
Because both Oct4 and c-Myc are well-known factors for
maintaining and re-establishing pluripotency, these data
shed light on how hypoxia-induced HIF2α stimulates the
tumorigenic potential of CSCs. Nonetheless, the role of
hypoxia-induced HIF2α in CSC tumorigenesis and the
potential mechanism by which HIF2α is increased during
tumorigenesis under hypoxic conditions remain unclear.
EFEMP1 (epidermal growth factor-containing
fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1), which is also
known as Fibulin-3, is a member of the fibulin family of
extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins [16]. The fibulin
family is widely distributed and is often associated with
vasculature and elastic tissues, whose major function
is to mediate homotypic interactions among cells and
heterotopic cell-matrix interactions [17]. It has been
previously reported that fibulin family members 1, 2, 4,
and 5 play crucial roles in the promotion of tumorigenesis
[16]. However, the relationship between EFEMP1 and
HIF2α during hypoxia-induced tumorigenesis remains
unclear. Because HIF signaling mediates increased fibulin
expression under hypoxic conditions [18] and because
fibulins seem to play an instrumental role in breast cancer
chemoresistance [19], we further investigated whether
hypoxia-induced EFEMP1 influences the tumorigenic
properties of CSCs as a both key regulator of hypoxia and
a downstream effector of hypoxia-induced HIF2α.
Here, we showed that hypoxia specifically upregulates a subset of CD44+/CD24−/low CSCs. Through
various in vitro studies, we found that HIF2α depletion
suppressed CSC-like phenotypes and CSC-mediated drug
resistance in breast cancer. Moreover, dysregulation of
EFEMP1 expression has been reported to correlate with

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis in cervical
cancer patients [20]. Although EFEMP1 seems to be
important in the development of breast cancer, its role
in BCSC functions remains unknown. We therefore
demonstrated, for the first time, that hypoxia-induced
BCSC sphere formation (CD44+/CD24−/low subpopulation)
in vitro and tumor formation in vivo were markedly
suppressed by EFEMP1 knockdown. Taken together,
these data suggest that HIF2α, but not HIF1α, mediates
hypoxia-induced breast cancer growth and that EFEMP1
promotes BCSC renewal and tumor metastasis as a
downstream effector of hypoxia-induced HIF2α during
breast tumorigenesis.

RESULTS
A subpopulation of stem-like cancer cells is
enriched by hypoxic conditions
It has been suggested that three-dimensional (3D)
sphere cultures demonstrated an enrichment of the cancer
stem/progenitor cell population in different types of
cancers, including breast [21], colon [22], and pancreatic
cancers [23]. Recent studies have suggested that the
stem cell markers c-Myc [24], Klf4 [25], Oct4 [26], and
Nanog [27] play important roles in maintaining BCSC
pluripotency. Here, we established a sphere-forming culture
system for use as an in vitro model for BCSC culture using
our published protocols [28]. To confirm whether sphereforming subpopulations and stem cell-like properties were
enriched under hypoxic conditions, we evaluated the
effects of hypoxia on sphere formation and the expression
profiles of the stem cell markers c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and
Nanog. The number and size of the spherical colonies were
significantly increased by hypoxia induced with cobalt
chloride (CoCl2) in both mouse (4T1) and human (Hs578T)
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1A). Consistent with the
sphere-formation results, the expression levels of stem cell
markers were increased in CoCl2-treated cells compared
with normoxic cells (Figure  1B). We also performed
FACS analysis to quantitate the percentage of the total
cell population with the CD44+/CD24– phenotype during
both hypoxia and normoxia. As expected, the relative
percentage of cells expressing these surface markers was
markedly increased in CoCl2-treated cells compared with
normoxic cells (Figure 1C).

Hypoxia stimulates the growth and stemnessrelated features of BCSCs through HIF2α
activity
Under hypoxic conditions, the aberrant expression or
transcriptional activity of HIF2α has been associated with
cancer cell amplification and tumorigenesis in a number
of studies [11, 14, 15]. Consistent with these results, our

previous study also demonstrated that HIF2α, but not
HIF1α, mediates the hypoxia-induced stimulation of
stemness-related features in BCSCs [28]. Therefore, it is
quite reasonable to hypothesize that hypoxia stimulates the
growth of BCSCs through the activation of HIF2α activity.
To determine whether CoCl2 treatment mimics actual
hypoxia-induced HIF2α expressions in our experimental
conditions, we performed western blotting to evaluate
the expression levels of HIF2α with or without CoCl2
treatment or hypoxic exposure. As expected, HIF2α
expression is consistently increased by either CoCl2
treatment or hypoxic exposure in a hypoxic chamber.
(Supplementary Figure 1). Using western blot analysis, we
evaluated whether the small molecule HIF2α inhibitor 76
was sufficient to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF2α expression
in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells. Approximate IC50 values
were determined using a dose-response curve. In both 4T1
and Hs578T cells, the IC50 values were 59 and 57 μM,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 2). Pre-treatment of
cells with the small molecule HIF2α inhibitor 76 potently
decreased the CoCl2-induced up-regulation of HIF2α
expression (Figure 2A). Additionally, to determine whether
the blockade of HIF2α activity affects HIF1α expression in

both 4T1 and Hs578T cells, we performed western blotting
analysis to investigate the expression levels of HIF1α with
or without HIF2α-specific inhibitor treatment. As expected,
the stimulatory effects of CoCl2 on HIF1α expression were
not affected by HIF2α-specific inhibitor treatment in both
4T1 and Hs578T cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
As a functional assay, we evaluated the effect of
HIF2α inhibitor 76 on primary and secondary sphere
formation. Treatment with HIF2α inhibitor 76 resulted
in the disruption of CoCl2-induced primary sphere
formation in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells (Figure 2B).
For the secondary sphere-forming assay, treated primary
spheres were collected and dissociated into single cells.
The cells from treated or untreated primary spheres were
re-plated on culture dishes without additional treatment.
Interestingly, we observed that in the presence of the
HIF2α inhibitor 76, the cells derived from primary
spheres did not form secondary spheres as efficiently as
the cells from untreated spheres did (Figure 2B). In breast
carcinomas, the CD44+/CD24– cell subset is thought
to represent a stem cell-like population and is enriched
in tumorigenic stem/progenitor cells [29]. Therefore,
we hypothesized that HIF2α inhibitor 76 might disrupt

hypoxia-induced BCSC sphere formation by targeting
CD44+/CD24– subpopulations. To test this hypothesis,
we used FACS analysis to investigate the effect of HIF2α
inhibitor 76 on CD44+/CD24– subpopulations. Indeed, the
treatment of 4T1 and Hs578T cells with HIF2α inhibitor
76 for 24 h decreased the size of CoCl2-induced CD44+/
CD24– subpopulation (Figure 2C). In breast carcinomas,
the ALDH positive subset is thought to represent a stem
cell-like population and is enriched in tumorigenic stem/
progenitor cells. Consistently, the treatment of Hs578T
cells with HIF2α inhibitor 76 for 24h decreased the size
of the ALDH positive subpopulation (Supplementary
Figure 4). Next, we examined the expression of BCSC
markers in the presence or absence of HIF2α inhibitor 76.
Consistent with our hypothesis, CoCl2-induced expression
levels of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Nanog were significantly
lower after HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment than they were

before (Figure 2D). Furthermore, we also investigated the
stimulatory effects of CoCl2 exposure on the BCSC sphere
formation (Supplementary Figure 5A), the size of the
CD44+/CD24– subpopulation (Supplementary Figure 5B),
and the expression of HIF1α and HIF2α (Supplementary
Figure 5C) with or without HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment
in other liable human breast cancer cell lines such as
MDA-MB-231.

HIF2α depletion suppresses BCSC growth and
chemo-resistance
To further confirm the results observed using small
molecule HIF2α inhibitor 76, we next knocked down
HIF2α using specific shRNA in both 4T1 and Hs578T
cells. Both 4T1 and Hs578T cells were transiently
transduced with shRNA #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5 targeting

inhibitory effect of small molecule HIF2α inhibitor 76 for 24h (10 µM for 4T1 cells; 25 µM for Hs578T cells) on CoCl2-induced expression
of HIF2α was assessed in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells by western blot analysis. (B) HIF2α inhibitor 76 inhibited primary (with HIF2α
inhibitor 76 daily treatment) and second sphere formation (without additional HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment) in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells.

average of three independent experiments. (C) Treatment of 4T1 and Hs578T cells with HIF2α inhibitor 76 for 24 h led to a decrease in

for 24h and HIF2α inhibitor 76 for 24h (10 µM for 4T1 cells; 25 µM for Hs578T cells) either alone or together were evaluated for the
expression levels of stem cell markers c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Nanog by Real-time PCR. Abbreviations: TSFE, Tumor sphere-forming

HIF2α. HIF2α shRNA construct #2, hereafter referred
to as HIF2α shRNA and, was the most efficient at
knockdown. After then, stable cell lines with HIF2α
knock-down was established using a lentivirus system.
Successful knockdown of HIF2α were verified based on
RNA and protein levels in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells
(Supplementary Figure 6). Consistent with the results
obtained from HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment, HIF2α
knockdown led to a significant decrease in CoCl2induced CD44+/CD24– subpopulations (Figure 3A) in
both 4T1 and Hs578T cells. The stimulatory effects of
CoCl2 on BCSC sphere formation were successfully
attenuated by HIF2α knockdown in both 4T1 and
Hs578T cells (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the stimulatory
effects of hypoxia on HIF1α expression were slightly

attenuated by HIF2α specific shRNA transection
(Supplementary Figure 7). These results suggest
that HIF2α may be at least partly involved in HIF1αmediated hypoxic effects. In contrast with the results
from HIF2α specific shRNA transection studies, these
effects were not affected by HIF2α-specific inhibitor
treatment in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells (Supplementary
Figure 3). Therefore, further studies are warranted to
investigate the functional Interaction between HIF1α
and HIF2α under hypoxia in more detail.
Recently, it has been suggested that BCSCs are
resistant to many conventional therapeutic approaches,
including chemotherapy [30] and radiotherapy [31].
Thus, although traditional approaches may kill the
majority of tumor cells, some BCSCs remain impervious

to treatment and instead survive and generate new tumors.
Consistent with previous studies [32], we found that both
the relative size and the sphere forming abilities of 4T1
and Hs578T cells increased with conventional docetaxel
treatment. However, these docetaxel-enriched sphere
formations were markedly reduced by HIF2α knockdown
(Figure  3C). Additionally, we conducted the additional
three set of experiments to investigate the potential role
of docetaxel treatment in the expressions of HIF1α and
HIF2α in both 4T1 and Hs578T cells. Interestingly,
docetaxel moderately increased HIF2α expression, but
not HIF1α, in 4T1 cells However, HIF1α and HIF2α
expressions were not affected by docetaxel in Hs578T
cells (Supplementary Figure 8).

suggesting that hypoxia-induced HIF2α expression is
highly associated with enhanced EFEMP1 expression in
breast cancer.
To determine whether EFEMP1 knockdown is
sufficient to inhibit hypoxia-induced BCSC sphere
formation, we knocked down EFEMP1 using specific
shRNA in Hs578T cells. A stable cell line with EFEMP1
knock-down was established using a lentivirus system
(Supplementary Figure 9A–9C). As a functional assay,
we evaluated the effect of EFEMP1 knockdown on
BCSC sphere formation. The stimulatory effects of
CoCl2 on BCSC sphere formation were successfully
attenuated by EFEMP1 knockdown in Hs578T cells
(Figure 5A). Consistent with the results obtained
from sphere formation, EFEMP1 knockdown led a
significant decrease in CoCl2-induced CD44+/CD24–
subpopulations in Hs578T cells (Figure 5B). In this
context, we examined the expression of BCSC markers
with or without EFEMP1 knockdown in Hs578T
cells. EFEMP1 knockdown moderately decreased the
expression levels of stem cell markers c-Myc, Klf4, and
Nanog under CoCl2 treatment (Figure 5C). These results
suggest that HIF2α mediates CoCl2-induced cancer
growth and that EFEMP1 is a downstream effector
of hypoxia-induced HIF2α in breast tumorigenesis.
Furthermore, we also examined the expression of
EFEMP1 with or without HIF1α specific shRNA
transection to further investigate whether HIF1α
involved in the regulation of EFEMP1 expression.
As expected, HIF1α knockdown does not affect the
expression level of EFEMP1 in all three additional
independent experiments (Supplementary Figure 10).
These results suggest that HIF1α may be not involved
in EFEMP1 expression.

Stimulatory effects of HIF2α on BCSCs are
achieved through the upregulation of EFEMP1
activity
We compared differential gene expression in
wild-type and HIF2α knockdown to identify potential
downstream targets of hypoxia-induced HIF2α using
a genome-wide microarray approach. We identified a
subset of genes whose expression is affected by HIF2αdepletion, indicating that these genes may be targeted
as downstream effectors of HIF2α (Supplementary
Table 1). Two criteria for the selection of gene expression
differences were employed: a significant t-test and foldchange magnitude. Among the genes examined, the
level of EFEMP1 mRNA was significantly suppressed
(≥ 3-fold change) in HIF2α knockdowns compared with
shRNA controls (Figure 4A). Interestingly, in quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR), which was used to verify the
microarray results, both HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment
and HIF2α knockdown were correlated with decreased
EFEMP1 levels (≥ 5.6- and 3.6-fold down-regulated,
respectively) under hypoxic conditions (Figure 4B). To
investigate the association between hypoxia-induced
tumorigenesis and EFEMP1 expression, we evaluated
the available breast cancer datasets using the Oncomine
dataset repository (www.oncomine.org). After specifically
filtering for breast cancer datasets showing a frequency of
tumor reoccurrence, we observed significant correlations
between EFEMP1 upregulation and a higher incidence
of breast cancer reoccurrence (Figure 4C). Moreover,
to investigate the oncogenic potential of hypoxia and its
regulatory role in HIF2α-induced EFEMP1 expression in
breast cancer, we analyzed the EFEMP1 expression levels
in the presence or absence of HIF2α inhibitor 76 under
CoCl2 treatment. Approximate IC50 values were determined
using a dose-response curve (Supplementary Figure 2).
Consistent with the results from microarray studies and
qPCR validation, CoCl2-induced expression levels of
EFEMP1 were significantly lower after HIF2α inhibitor 76
treatment in multiple breast cancer cell types (Figure 4D),

EFEMP1 knockdown reduces tumor growth in a
murine xenograft model
To assess the effect of EFEMP1 knockdown on
breast cancer cell growth, cell viability was measured
using an MTT assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96well plates. After 48 h of incubation, cell viability was
assessed by cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular
Technologies Inc) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The numbers of viable cells were measured
at a wavelength of 450 nm using Versamax microplate
reader. As shown in Figure 6A, a time-dependent
decrease in the number of EFEMP1-knockdown cells
was observed compared with the control shRNAinfected cells. A flow cytometry assay using PE-labeled
Annexin-V was used to evaluate the effect of EFEMP1
knockdown on apoptosis. The apoptotic rate of Hs578T
cells transfected with EFEMP1-specific shRNA reached
7.48%, whereas this rate was 1.6% in control shRNAtransfected cells (Figure 6B). Apoptotic cell death was

qualitatively estimated by DAPI staining for nuclear
condensation and fragmentation. EFEMP1 knockdown
led to significant DNA fragmentation compared with
shRNA controls (Figure 6C). We also investigated the
roles of EFEMP1 in the invasion and migration of human
breast cancer cells using a transwell migration assay.
Cells that migrated across the membrane were stained
purple and counted. The results showed that following
EFEMP1 knockdown, the migration ability across the
transwell membrane was significantly decreased in the
upper compartment of the transwell units (Figure 6D),
suggesting that EFEMP1 is necessary for migration
and might thus play a role in breast cancer metastasis.

Previous studies have indicated that the actin cytoskeleton
is required for tumor cell migration by pushing or pulling
on the substrate near the cell membrane [33]. Therefore,
we examined the distribution of the actin cytoskeleton at
the subcellular level in Hs578T cells following EFEMP1
knockdown. Actin-phalloidin staining revealed a strong
correlation between EFEMP1 knockdown and a highly
disorganized actin cytoskeleton (Figure 6E), suggesting
that the reduced migration of EFEMP1-knockdown
cells may be related to the disorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton.
Following our in vitro experiments, we further
investigated the in vivo efficacy of EFEMP1 knockdown

wide microarray analysis are presented as a density map of genes differentially expressed between wild-type and HIF2α knocked-down

analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. (B) To verify the results obtained by microarray using quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR), Hs578T cells treated with or without HIF2α shRNA transfection for the expression level of EFEMP1. In quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR), which was used to verify the microarray results, HIF2α inhibitor 76 (25 µM) treatment for 24 h was correlated with decreased
EFEMP1 levels (≥ 5.6- and 3.6-fold down-regulated, respectively) under hypoxic conditions. (C) A significant correlation between tumor
reoccurrence and the expression of EFEMP1 was observed in human breast cancer datasets available through the Oncomine dataset
repository (www.oncomine.org). (D) Multiple breast cancer cell lines (4T1, 67NR, Hs578T, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435) treated with

EFEMP1-knockdown Hs578T cells were injected into
the mammary fat pads of female nude mice, and tumor
formation was monitored. Importantly, there was a
consistent and significant reduction in tumor outgrowth

in mice that were injected with EFEMP1 knockdown
cells compared with control cells, indicating that
EFEMP1 knockdown significantly impaired the tumor
initiation potential of BCSCs (Figure 6F). We further
performed an extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA)

to evaluate the inhibitory effect of EFEMP1 knockdown
on tumorigenesis. Following the isolation of cells from
freshly digested tumor tissues, we transplanted limiting
dilutions (from 1 × 104 to 1 × 106 cells) of the cell
preparations into mice. The repopulating unit frequency
of the basal population was 1/4242 for controls and
1/563240 for EFEMP1 knockdown in Hs578T cells
(Figure 6G).

their significant similarities, HIF2α expression was
principally restricted to most vascular endothelial
cells [39] and had many different transcriptional target
genes, including pluripotency-associated genes [11,
15]. These results suggest an important and unexpected
role for HIF2α in the regulation of cancer progression,
such as the tumorigenic potential of CSCs. Li et al.
showed that HIF2α is co-localized with cancer stem
cell markers in glioblastomas and its expression
correlates with poor glioma patient survival [10]. This
finding suggests a specific role for HIF2α in promoting
self-renewal and stem-like CSC phenotypes. Pahlman
et al. also demonstrated that high HIF-2α expression
further correlates with more immature phenotypes
and poor outcomes in patients undergoing brain tumor
surgery [13]. Moreover, hypoxia-induced HIF2α also
increases the expression of stem cell-associated genes
(Oct4 [15] and c-Myc [11]) and confers tumorigenic
potential to non-CSCs [14]. Because both Oct4 and
c-Myc are factors modulating stem cell self-renewal
ability and differentiation, these data shed light on how
hypoxia-induced HIF2α stimulates the tumorigenic
potential of BCSCs. Consistent with this hypothesis,
our results showed that the stimulatory effects of
hypoxia on BCSC sphere formation, CD44+/CD24−/ low
subpopulations, and the expression levels of stem
cell markers (c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Nanog) were
successfully attenuated by both HIF2α inhibitor 76
treatment and HIF2α knockdown (Figures 2 and 3).
These findings are significant in showing that hypoxiainduced HIF2α may alter basic gene expression in
breast cancer cells in a manner that can be transmitted
to more stem-like phenotypes.
To further identify genes downstream of HIF2α
under hypoxic conditions, we performed a microarray.
Accordingly, our data show that EFEMP1 mRNA levels
were significantly suppressed in HIF2α knockdowns
compared with shRNA controls (Figure 4A). EFEMP1,
which is also known as Fibulin-3, is a member of the
fibulin family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins
[16]. In cancer, multiple and diverse functions for
fibulin family members have been suggested [40]. It has
been shown that fibulin-1 mediates chemo-resistance
in breast cancer cells and furthermore seems to play
pivotal roles in cancer immuno-surveillance [19, 41].
Several previous studies have implied a potential role of
the fibulin family members in colorectal tumorigenesis
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast
carcinoma [42, 43]. Interestingly, the role of HIF2α on
EFEMP1 regulation is further supported by data from
both HIF2α inhibitor 76 treatment and HIF2α knockdown
experiments, in which HIF2α-depletion was correlated
with decreased EFEMP1 levels (≥ 5.6 and 3.6-fold
down-regulated, respectively) under hypoxic conditions
(Figure 4B). More strikingly, our data indicate that the

DISCUSSION
Approximately 30% to 50% of the patients
diagnosed with early stage breast cancer are likely
to progress to the metastatic stage, despite intensive
conventional treatment, including surgery and
chemotherapy [34]. Thus, the CSC concept has emerged as
an important milestone in the understanding of chemodrug
resistance and cancer recurrence [35]. Based on their
characteristics, targeting and eradicating CSCs represents
a potential strategy for significantly improving clinical
outcomes. Moreover, Lagadec et al. revealed a significant
increase in the BCSC population in various breast cancer
cell lines after conventional chemo-drug treatment under
hypoxic conditions [36]. Thus, the identification and
development of new therapeutic approaches based on
targeting the hypoxia-dependent responses in BCSCs is
urgent.
In recent years, a number of studies have
suggested that hypoxia appears to be strongly associated
with various physiological processes, particularly when
rapid tissue growth far exceeds blood supply. For
example, rapidly growing tumors occur in a physiologic
“hypoxic” environment (1%–2% O2) [37]. The hypoxic
niche has been shown to play an important role in the
maintenance of normal stem cells, but its roles in CSC
function are largely unknown. Recently, our group
identified hypoxia as one of the prominent microenvironmental factors regulating the self-renewal ability
of BCSCs, partially by enhancing CSC phenotypes such
as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity [28].
Consistent with the previous results, the present study
shows that the number and size of CSC spheres, the
expression levels of stem cell markers (c-Myc, Klf4,
Oct4, and Nanog), and the percentage of cells with a
CD44+/ CD24−/low phenotype were significantly increased
by hypoxia in both mouse and human breast cancer cells
(Figure 1A–1C).
The stimulatory effects of hypoxia on the selfrenewal and tumor initiation of CSCs seem to be
primarily mediated by HIFs, particularly HIF2α. Since
its initial discovery, HIF2α has been demonstrated
to have common transcriptional target genes with
HIF1α, such as Ang2, Tie-2, and VEGF. Both
HIF1α and HIF2α also show significant homology
with the putative DNA binding sites [38]. Despite

down-regulation of EFEMP1 expression is associated
with the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis.
The stimulatory effects of hypoxia on BCSC sphere
formation were successfully attenuated by EFEMP1
knockdown in Hs578T cells (Figure 5A). Consistent with
the results obtained from the sphere formation assay,
EFEMP1 knockdown led to smaller CD44+/CD24−/low
subpopulations in Hs578T cells under hypoxic conditions
(Figure 5B). Indeed, stable transfection of Hs578T cells
with an shRNA construct targeting EFEMP1 results
in a significant suppression of cell migration across
the transwell membrane (Figure 6D), suggesting that
EFEMP1 is necessary for migration and therefore might
play roles in breast cancer metastasis.
Moreover, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is
required for tumor cell migration because the cytoskeleton

pushes or pulls on the substrate near the cell membrane
[33], and such changes are induced by EFEMP1
knockdown (Figure 6E). These changes may result in
accelerated metastasis and lead to greater tumorigenesis
in vivo. Therefore, to further confirm the connection
between EFEMP1 and breast cancer tumorigenesis in
vitro, we assessed the effects of EFEMP1 knockdown
on tumorigenesis using an in vivo Hs578T cell model.
We found that the tumor formation in the mammary fat
pads of female nude mice was significantly reduced in the
EFEMP1-transfected groups compared with the control
shRNA-infected groups in metastatic tumor models (Figure
6F and 6G), indicating that EFEMP1 depletion significantly
impaired the tumor initiation potential of BCSCs. These
findings are consistent with the potential importance of
HIF2α/EFEMP1 cascades in breast cancer growth in vitro.

Figure 6: The effects of EFEMP1 knockdown on tumor growth, apoptosis and metastasis. (A) Transfection of cells with

EFEMP1 shRNA led to a time-dependent decrease in the number of cells compared with transfection using control shRNA. (B) EFEMP1
knockdown-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated by flow cytometry using PE-labeled Annexin-V. (C) EFEMP1 knockdown-mediated
apoptotic DNA fragmentation and condensation were visualized using DAPI staining. (D) Cell migration ability was evaluated using
the transwell migration assay. Transfection with EFEMP1 shRNA significantly decreased Hs578T cell migration across the membrane
compared with transfection using control shRNA. (E) EFEMP1 knockdown-induced fiber disorganization and a full morphological
transition were visualized by actin-phalloidin staining. (F) Mice were implanted with Hs578T cells (1 x 106 cells/mouse) by orthotopic
injection into thoracic mammary fat pads. Tumor tissue was isolated from mice bearing Hs578T cells transfected with EFEMP1 shRNA
or control shRNA. Tumor volumes were measured as described in the Materials and Methods section. (G) Hs578T cells transfected with
EFEMP1 shRNA or control shRNA were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice in limiting dilutions (from 1 × 104 to 1 × 106 cells).
Tumor formation was observed for 8 weeks following inoculation. BCSC frequency was calculated using an extreme limiting dilution assay
(ELDA). The results are the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

In summary, consistent with previous studies
[44], our study demonstrates that the stimulatory
effects of hypoxia on BCSC sphere formation, CD44+/
CD24– subpopulations, and the expression levels of
stem cell markers (c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Nanog)
were successfully attenuated by HIF2α-depletion.
These findings suggest that the inhibition of hypoxiainduced HIF2α suppresses the growth and functionality
of BCSCs, which might be key drivers of breast cancer

metastasis and recurrence. To the best of our knowledge,
the stimulatory effects of hypoxia-induced HIF2α on
BCSC sphere formation were successfully attenuated by
EFEMP1 knockdown in Hs578T cells. Taken together,
these data suggest that HIF2α, but not HIF1α, mediates
hypoxia-induced cancer growth/metastasis and that
EFEMP1 is a downstream effector of hypoxia-induced
HIF2α during breast tumorigenesis, as illustrated in
Figure 7.

Figure 7: Schematic summary of the role of the HIF2α/EFEMP1 cascade in the development of metastatic breast
cancer. HIF2α/EFEMP1 cascade stimulates self-renewal and migration of CSCs, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis/systemic
dissemination in breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(Invitrogen), and one-tenth of the cDNA was used for
each PCR mixture containing Express SYBR-Green qPCR
Supermix (BioPrince, Seoul, Korea). Real-time PCR was
performed using a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). The reaction
was subjected to 40-cycle amplification at 95°C for 20 sec,
at 60°C for 20 sec and at 72°C for 25 sec. Relative mRNA
expression of selected genes was normalized to HPRT and
quantified using the ΔΔCT method (ΔΔCt: target/reference
ratio in experimental sample relative to target/reference
ratio). The sequences of the PCR primers are listed in
Table 1. Microarray array was performed whole genome
gene-expression analysis using GeneChip® Human Gene
1.0 ST Array from DNA Link USA, Inc. The microarray
array was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) software. The genes whose expression decreased
more than 1.5-fold are listed in supplementary table 1.

Cell culture and reagents
Murine mammary cancer cell line 4T1 and human
breast cancer cell line Hs578T were cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 U/ ml streptomycin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) at
37°C and 5% CO2. HIF2α inhibitor 76 purchased from
Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).

Short hairpin RNA
Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting mouse
HIF2α (TRCN0000003806, NM_001430X-1694S1C1),
EFEMP1 (TRCN00000055963, NM_004105.2-372S1C1),
and non-targeting RNA (SHC001) were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). For the efficient HIF2α and
EFEMP1 shRNA transfection, transfection was performed
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. We chose the HIF2α and
EFEMP1 shRNA that is most effective in mRNA levels
from five shRNA designed from the target sequence and
determined by qRT-PCR.

Flow cytometry
FACS analysis and cell sorting were performed
using FACS Calibur and FACS Aria machines (Becton
Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. FACS data were
analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland,
OR). Antibodies to the following proteins were used: PEconjugated CD44 (BD Bioscience, Cat.559942, dilution
1/40) and CD24 (BD Bioscience, Cat.555428, dilution
1/40). The FACS gates were established by staining with
isotype antibody or secondary antibody.

Tumorsphere formation
Single cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM
(Invitrogen) containing B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF,
20 ng/ml bFGF (PeproTech) and 4 μg/ml heparin (SigmaAldrich). Primary tumorspheres were derived by plating
50,000 single cells/well into six-well ultra-low attachment
dishes (Corning). Individual spheres ≥ 100 μm from each
replicate well (n ≥ 9 wells) were counted under an inverted
microscope at 50× magnification using the Image-Pro
Plus program (Media Cybernetics). The percentage of
cells capable of forming spheres, termed the ‘tumorsphere
formation efficiency (TSFE)’, was calculated as follows:
[(number of sphere formed/number of single cells plated)
X 100].

Protein isolation and western blot analysis
Protein expression levels were determined by
western blot analysis as previously described. [45]
Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM
Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01 %
NP 40, 0.2 mM PMSF. The protein concentrations of the
total cell lysates were measured by using bovine serum
albumin as standard. Samples containing equal amounts
of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Bio-RAD Laboratories). The membranes
were blocked with 5 % skim milk in Tris buffered saline
containing Tween-20 at RT, and the membranes were
with HIF1α (Abcam AB2185), HIF2α (Novus biologicals
NB100-132), or EFEMP1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
SC-365224) antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 90 min at RT.
Antibody-bound proteins were detected using an ECL.

Cell proliferation assay
4T1 and Hs578T cells were seeded in 96-well plates.
After 48 h of incubation, cell viability was assessed by cell
counting kit-8 (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The numbers of viable cells were measured
at a wavelength of 450 nm using Versamax microplate
reader.

Immunofluorescent staining

Real-time PCR and Microarray

Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
fluorescent staining. Samples were permeabilized with
0.3 M glycine and 0.3% Triton X-100, and nonspecific
binding was blocked with 2% normal swine serum
(DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Staining was performed

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). RNA purity was verified by measuring
260/280 absorbance ratio. The first strand of cDNA was
synthesized with 1μg of total RNA using SuperScript II

examined by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510
Meta). The calculation of expression was based on green
fluorescence area and density divided by cell number, as
determined from the number of DAPI-stained nuclei, in
three randomly selected fields for each sample from a total
of three independent experiments.

the chemotactic index, the number of cells migrated in
response to EFEMP1 knockdown was divided by the
number of spontaneously migrated cells (control).

Tumorigenesis experiment
All animal experiments were approved and carried
out in accordance with IACUC (Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee) guidelines (No.LCDI-20120069) of the Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute.
For tumorigenesis experiments, EFEMP1-knockdowned
(1 ×  106 cells/mouse) or control (1 × 106 cells/mouse)
Hs578T cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of
female nude mice in 50µL volume (n = 6 for each group),
and tumor formation was measured after 8 weeks.

In vitro cell migration assay
Cell were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 200 μL
of culture medium in the upper chamber of Transwell
permeable supports (Corning Inc, Corning, NY) with
8.0- μm pore, polycarbonate membrane, 6.5-mm diameter,
and 24-well plate format) to track migration of Hs578T
cells. The cells on the upper surface of the membranes
were completely removed by using a cotton swab.
Migrated cells on the lower surface of the membranes
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,
stained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich), and later the
number of cells was counted in three randomly selected
