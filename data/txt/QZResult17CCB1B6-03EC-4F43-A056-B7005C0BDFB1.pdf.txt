Abstract
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) is currently
approved as second-line treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).
MM-related bone disease is one of the most debilitating
complications of MM. Besides supportive care with biphosphonates, which have proven efficacy in reducing and delaying
skeletal-related events, there is no specific treatment of lytic
bone lesions. The present study investigated the effect of
bortezomib alone or in combination with a hydroxamatebased histone deacetylase inhibitor, JNJ-26481585 on tumor
burden, and MM bone disease in the 5T2MM model. Injection
of 5T2MM cells into C57Bl/KaLwRij mice resulted in MM bone
disease, characterized by an increase in the percentage
osteoclasts, a decrease in osteoblasts, trabecular bone volume,
trabecular number, and the development of bone lesions.
Treatment of 5T2MM-bearing mice with bortezomib significantly reduced tumor burden, angiogenesis, and MM bone
disease. More importantly, the combination of bortezomib
with JNJ-26481585 resulted in a more pronounced reduction of
osteoclasts and increase of osteoblasts, trabecular bone
volume, and trabecular number compared with bortezomib
as single agent. These data suggest that bortezomib has bone
remodeling properties that can be improved in combination
with low dose JNJ-26481585. The study indicates that this
combination therapy could be a useful strategy for the
treatment of MM patients, especially in those patients with
skeletal complications. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5307–11]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B-cell malignancy
characterized by an accumulation of plasma cells in the bone
marrow (BM) secreting monoclonal immunoglobulins. Reciprocal
interactions between the tumor cells and the BM microenvironment
result in increased cell survival and growth, release of cytokines,
development of drug resistance, angiogenesis, and induction of bone
disease. The latter is caused by a MM-induced imbalance between
bone resorption and bone formation, resulting in osteolytic bone
destruction and subsequent clinical complications such as pathologic bone fractures, hypercalcaemia, and bone pain (1).

The introduction of novel targeting agents in the treatment of
MM such as bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, which not
only affect the MM cell directly, but also its interactions with the
BM microenvironment, has been a major step forward in the
therapeutic options for patients. Despite these improvements,
osteolytic bone disease remains an important cause of morbidity in
these patients. Besides supportive care with biphosphonates, there
are currently limited agents available that can prevent development of MM-related bone disease (2).
Bortezomib, a first-in-class, potent, and reversible proteasome
inhibitor, acts on different targets in MM. Bortezomib is an
effective therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with
recent proven superiority even in newly diagnosed patients
requiring therapy (3).
Preclinical and clinical data suggest that bortezomib also has a
positive effect on bone remodeling by inhibiting osteoclast
formation and stimulating osteoblast differentiation as reviewed
by Terpos and colleagues (4). The effect of bortezomib on bone
disease is thought to be direct and not only a consequence of the
anti-MM effect. However, the mechanism by which bortezomib
regulates MM bone disease in vivo is unclear and therefore further
studies are required.
The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of
bortezomib in vivo in the 5T2MM murine model of MM with
emphasis on the associated key processes in MM microenvironment such as BM osteolysis and angiogenesis. In addition, we
investigated whether JNJ-26481585, a novel ‘‘second generation’’
pyrimidyl-hydroxamate–based histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, had a more pronounced effect when combined with
bortezomib. Compared with J&J first generation HDAC inhibitor
(HDACi) R306465, JNJ-26481585 has significantly improved
pharmacodynamic properties with, e.g., a longer half-life and a
sustained pharmacodynamic response in vivo.5

5TMM Model
The in vivo growing 5T2MM cells originated spontaneously in elderly
C57BL/KaLwRij mice and have since been propagated by i.v. transfer of
diseased marrow in young syngeneic immunocompetent mice (5, 6).
We used the 5T2MM model that mimics the human disease closely having
a selective growth in the BM, inducing angiogenesis and MM-associated
bone disease. Because freshly isolated 5T2MM cells only survive for short
periods, the 5T33MMvt cell line was used for incubation periods of 72 h.

Drugs
Bortezomib (Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., J&J PRD), mixed with mannitol
in a ratio of 1:10, was solubilized in 0.9% sodium chloride at the appropriate
concentration before each s.c. injection.
The HDACi, JNJ-26481585 (Johnson & Johnson), was prepared in a
solvent containing 10% HP-h CD, 0.8% HCl 0.1 N, 0.9% NaOH 0.1N, 3.4%
mannitol, and pyrogen-free water.
For in vitro studies, bortezomib and JNJ-26481585 stock solutions were
prepared at 1 and 5 mmol/L, respectively, in tissue-culture grade DMSO.

Assessment of Viability in 5T33MMvt Cells
The MTS colorimetric assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium; Promega] was used as
previously described to assess the viability of 5T33MMvt cells (7).

Therapeutic Treatment of 5T2MM-Bearing Mice
Treatment with bortezomib as single therapy. Two groups of 10 mice
were injected i.v. with 2.106 5T2MM cells, one group of 10 mice was
included as negative control (naive, nontumor-bearing mice). Progression of
MM in 5T2MM-bearing mice was assessed by measuring serum paraprotein

concentrations, using protein electrophoresis. From the time paraprotein
was detectable by serum electrophoresis (at week 8), treatment started with
either bortezomib (0.8 mg/kg, twice weekly, s.c.; n = 10) or vehicle (NaCl
0.9%; n = 10).
Treatment with bortezomib + JNJ-26481585. Four groups of 10 mice
each were injected i.v. with 2.106 5T2MM cells and one group was included as
negative control (n = 10). Treatment was administrated s.c. in tumor-bearing
mice and started when paraprotein was detectable, at week 8. Four different
treatment groups were defined: group 1, vehicle bortezomib (NaCl 0.9%) +
solvent JNJ-26481585; group 2, bortezomib (0.6 mg/kg, twice weekly);
group 3, JNJ-26481585 (1.25 mg/kg, every other day); group 4, bortezomib
(0.6 mg/kg, twice weekly) + JNJ-26481585 (1.25 mg/kg, every other day).
All mice were sacrificed at week 12, the time point when the vehicle
group showed signs of morbidity (paralysis of the hind legs). The tibia was
dissected free of soft tissue and processed for bone histomorphometric
analysis as described below. BM was isolated from hind legs and tumor
burden was assessed as described below. One femur was fixed in zinc
fixative and further processed to assess BM angiogenesis. Blood samples
were obtained to determine serum paraprotein concentrations (5).

Assessment of Tumor Burden
Serum paraprotein was measured by electrophoresis and plasmacytosis
was determined on May-Grünwald-Giemsa stained cytosmears of mononuclear BM cells.

Assessment of Angiogenesis
The microvessel density was determined by CD31 staining as previously
described (8). The number of blood vessels was counted in an area of
0.22 mm2, in the area with the highest blood vessel density (hotspot).

Results and Discussion

Analysis of Bone Disease
Tibiae were scanned using a microCT scanner (model 1172; Skyscan)
at 50 kV and 200 AA with a pixel size of 4.3 Am, an image being
captured every 0.7j through 180j rotation of each bone. Scanned images
were reconstructed and analyzed using the Skyscan Recon and Skyscan
CT analysis software, respectively. Trabecular volume, thickness, and
number were evaluated in a standardized region of interest. The region
of interest was defined as a volume starting 0.2 mm from the growth
plate and extending 1 mm in length, the cross-sectional area being
limited by the border with the cortical bone. All trabecular bone within
this region was measured; the bone being differentiated from soft tissue
by thresholding the grayscale images. Subsequently, the right tibiae were
decalcified, embedded in paraffin, and 3-Am sections cut and stained
with H&E or enzymatically stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. Osteoblasts were identified on the basic of characteristic
morphology and the osteoclasts were identified after tartrate resistant
acid phosphatase staining. The number of osteoclasts (/mm) and
osteoblasts (/mm) was measured using the Osteomeasure bone
histomorphometry software (Osteometrics).

In the present study, we observed that bortezomib has potent
antimyeloma effects on 5T33MMvt cells in vitro at low nmol/L
concentrations. After 72 hours of incubation, bortezomib inhibited
the growth in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 4.33 F 0.56
nmol/L (data not shown), consistent with previous reports using
human MM cell lines and freshly isolated patient MM cells (9) and
thus indicated similar sensitivity of the 5TMM cells to bortezomib
as human MM cells.
We subsequently analyzed the effect of bortezomib in vivo on
MM cell growth, angiogenesis, and osteolytic bone lesions in the
5T2MM model (5, 6). In the first series of experiments, treatment of
the 5T2MM mice with bortezomib started when serum paraprotein
could be detected in tumor-bearing mice, thereby simulating a
therapeutic setting. In the 5T2MM tumor–bearing mice, treatment
with bortezomib resulted in a reduction of BM plasmacytosis of
98% and no paraprotein could be detected with electrophoresis in
the treated group (P < 0.0001, compared with vehicle treated group;
Fig. 1A and B). Bortezomib treatment of the tumor-bearing mice
also resulted in a near-normalization of microvessel density in the
BM (Fig. 1C). This reduction in the microvessel density could not
only be a consequence of the reduction of tumor burden but also

by direct effects of bortezomib on endothelial cells. Roccaro and
colleagues (10) showed in vitro and in vivo direct effects of
bortezomib by reducing the proliferation, chemotaxis, and capillary
formation of endothelial cells.
The development of the MM-related bone disease in the vehicletreated mice was characterized by an induction in osteolytic bone
lesions as illustrated by microCT images (Fig. 2A), a decrease in
trabecular bone volume (P < 0.05; Fig. 2B), a decrease in trabecular
number (P < 0.05; Fig. 2C), an increase in the number of osteoclasts
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3A), and a decrease in the number of osteoblasts (P <
0.05; Fig. 3B). Treatment of the tumor-bearing mice with
bortezomib (0.8 mg/kg) resulted in a decrease of osteolytic lesions
and a 3.5-fold increase in trabecular number and trabecular bone
volume compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05; Fig. 2). Decrease
of MM-related bone disease may reflect a direct effect on the MM
cells as a result of a reduction of tumor burden or due to a direct
effect on osteoclasts and/or osteoblasts. In tumor-bearing mice,
treated with bortezomib, we observed that the number of
osteoclasts was reduced by 50% (P < 0.05) and returned to levels
seen in naive mice (Fig. 3A). The number of osteoblasts was
increased for 400% compared with the vehicle group and was also
f50% greater than that seen in naive tumor-free mice (P < 0.05;
Fig. 3). This suggests that, apart from the indirect effect of
bortezomib, it may also directly affected osteoblasts in a more
pronounced way than osteoclasts, confirming previous results
(11, 12). Preclinical studies have shown that bortezomib stimulates
the Wnt pathway in osteoblasts by reducing DKK-1 levels in the
BM, resulting in an induction of osteoblast differentiation and an
increases of osteoblast activity (13). Our results obtained with
bortezomib as single agent are consistant with recently published
data from Pennisi and colleagues (14) who showed the bone
anabolic effect of bortezomib in severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID)–rab mice engrafted with primary human MM cells.
Inhibition of HDAC activity promotes the maturation of
osteoblasts and induces the apoptosis of osteoclasts in vitro
(15, 16). Based on these observations, it is possible that HDACis

may regulate MM-related osteolytic bone disease, independent of
its effects on tumor burden and may be of value in combination
therapy with bortezomib as both compounds affect different
pathways in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In support of this, Feng
and colleagues (17) showed in vitro that drug combination of
bortezomib and the HDACi, PXD101, resulted in a synergistic
inhibition of MM cell survival and osteoclast formation. Therefore,
in the present study, we evaluated in vivo the effect of HDAC
inhibition in MM and its effects on MM related bone disease, using
JNJ-26481585, a novel second generation pyrimidyl-hydroxamate–
based pan-HDACi.
We combined bortezomib (0.6 mg/kg, twice weekly, s.c.) at a
concentration where 99% of the tumor load was reduced in the
5T2MM model (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A) and bone disease was reduced
partially (P < 0.05; Figs. 2B and C and 3), with a suboptimal dose
of JNJ-26481585 (1.25 mg/kg, every other day, s.c.). 5T2MM mice
treated with JNJ-26481585 at this low dose showed no significant
reduction in the tumor burden in the BM (P > 0.05; Fig. 1A) and
did not reduce the bone disease significantly (Fig. 2). JNJ-26481585
treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg every other day in the 5T2MM
model resulted in a dramatic reduction in tumor burden,
angiogenesis, and MM bone disease, demonstrating the potent
antimyeloma activity of this compound at higher concentrations
(18). As we observed a reduction of almost 100% in the tumor
load (Fig. 2A) when bortezomib was used as single agent, we
could not observe any additive reduction on this parameter with
the combination of both drugs. Despite this lack of additional
effect on tumor burden, we did observe a increase in bone volume
(Fig. 2B), trabecular number (Fig. 2C), and the bone surface
covered by osteoblasts (Fig. 3B), when we combined both drugs
compared with their effect as single agents. In addition, a further
reduction in the proportion of bone surface covered by
osteoclasts was observed (Fig. 3A). The effect in the combination
treatment is more significant on osteoclast than osteoblast
because bortezomib as single agent already had an effect on the
number of osteoblasts, and it is unlikely that it is possible to

stimulate osteblasts any further. This was not seen with the
number of osteoclasts as they were not affected by bortezomib
treatment alone at 0.6 mg/kg twice weekly. This is in line with
data of Mukherjee and colleagues (12).
Although not significant for all parameters, in the combination
therapy, the trabecular number, the percentage bone volume, and
percentage osteoblasts covering the bone surface was greater than
that seen in naive tumor-free mice, whereas the percentage
osteoclasts covering the bone surface was lower than in naive mice.
These results suggest that the combination therapy reduces the
MM bone disease directly by affecting osteoblasts and osteoclasts
and indirectly by reducing the tumor load. A synergistic
antimyeloma activity in MM cells using a combination of
bortezomib and HDACi has been reported previously by others
(19, 20). We are the first demonstrating in vivo that this
combination therapy could also result in an enhanced reduction
of the MM associated bone disease.
In addition, we also observed a more pronounced effect on bone
volume, trabecular number, and osteoclasts covering the bone
surface using the combination treatment (0.6 mg/kg bortezomib +
