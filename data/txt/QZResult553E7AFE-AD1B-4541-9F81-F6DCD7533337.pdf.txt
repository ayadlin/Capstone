ABSTRACT
Occurrence of an inherent or acquired resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug
docetaxel is a major burden for patients suffering from different kinds of malignancies,
including castration resistant prostate cancer (PCa). In the present study we address
the question whether PIAS1 targeting can be used to establish a basis for improved PCa
treatment. The expression status and functional relevance of PIAS1 was evaluated in
primary tumors, in metastatic lesions, in tissue of patients after docetaxel chemotherapy,
and in docetaxel resistant cells. Patient data were complemented by functional studies
on PIAS1 knockdown in vitro as well as in chicken chorioallantoic membrane and mouse
xenograft in vivo models. PIAS1 was found to be overexpressed in local and metastatic
PCa and its expression was further elevated in tumors after docetaxel treatment as
well as in docetaxel resistant cells. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown experiments
revealed an increased expression of tumor suppressor p21 and declined expression of
anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1, which caused diminished cell proliferation and tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo. In summary, the presented data indicate that PIAS1 is
crucial for parental and docetaxel resistant PCa cell survival and is therefore a promising
new target for treatment of primary, metastatic, and chemotherapy resistant PCa.

It has been hypothesized that development
of docetaxel insensitivity is a consequence of a
dynamic adaptation of tumor cells to the changing
tumor microenvironment during chemotherapy.
These adaptations may include but are not limited to
protein isoform switching/dysregulation/mutations,
alterations in drug efflux mechanisms, and altered
expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins [6, 7].
In this context, an acquired docetaxel resistant
phenotype has already been associated with changes in
isotypes of β-tubulin, the primary target of docetaxel
[8, 9], and with multi drug resistance mechanisms
(MDRM) including an increased expression of drug

INTRODUCTION
For treatment of castration resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) a systemic chemotherapy has been
developed in the last years [1–3]. The chemotherapeutic
drug docetaxel (Taxotere®) is given to patients after
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) failure on the basis
of improved overall survival, pain reduction, prostatespecific antigen response, and quality of life [3].
However, in many cases its application is limited due
to occurrence of an inherent or acquired docetaxel
resistance [4]. The survival benefit for CRPC patients is
modest being just a few months [5].

transporters like P-glycoprotein [10, 11], or an elevated
drug metabolism triggered by high activity of drug
detoxifying proteins such as glutathione-S-transferase
[12]. In addition, studies have suggested a potential
role of anti-apoptotic proteins like members of the
inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family (XIAP, BIRC5)
[13–15] and of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family
(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) in chemotherapy resistance [16–18].
However, despite the development of inhibitors against
these proteins and their application in clinical trials as
single or combination therapies [19–22], the outcome
was not satisfying with at best modest results. Thus,
identification of new molecular targets is urgently
required to combat chemotherapy resistance, improve
therapeutic strategies, and prolong patient survival.
Protein inhibitors of activated signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT) factors (PIAS)
proteins, which comprise a family of 4 multifunctional
members called PIAS1 to 4, are known to play a role
in the modulation of cytokine signaling by inhibiting
the activity of STATs [23–25]. PIAS1 and PIAS3 are
especially induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6), which was
already reported to have an impact on chemotherapy
resistance [26, 27]. Besides the DNA and protein binding
ability, which is mediated by the conserved SAP domain,
PIAS proteins also contain a RING finger-like zincbinding domain (RLD) as well as a SUMO interaction
motif (SIM), thus functioning as SUMO-E3 ligases.
Recently, it was demonstrated that PIAS1 mediated
SUMOylation is essential for DNA repair [28, 29].
Furthermore, PIAS1 is an important cell cycle regulator,
which promotes cell proliferation by SUMOylation
triggered inhibition of p73 and p53 [30–32]. As a highly
proliferative behavior and suppression of apoptotic
stimuli are the main characteristic features of docetaxel
resistant cells, the above-mentioned observations
render PIAS1 an interesting target protein for further
investigation.
In order to address the question if PIAS1 targeting
can be used for an improved PCa therapy, we analyzed
PIAS1 expression in primary tumors of all stages, in
metastatic lesions, in tissue of patients after chemotherapy
with docetaxel, and in docetaxel resistant cell lines. Our
patient data were complemented by functional experiments
after transient and stable PIAS1 knockdown in vitro as
well as by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays
and mouse xenograft experiments in vivo.
In this study, we confirm elevated PIAS1
expression in PCa and demonstrate for the first time
that PIAS1 is, in addition, significantly induced after
docetaxel treatment in patients as well as in docetaxel
resistant cells in vitro. Furthermore, PIAS1 knockdown
leads to increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor
p21 and to reduced Mcl1 levels, thereby resulting in
induced apoptosis of parental and docetaxel resistant
tumor cells.

PIAS1 expression is elevated in primary tumors,
in metastatic lesions, and in PCa patients after
chemotherapy with docetaxel
In a previous publication [33] we reported an
elevated PIAS1 expression in primary tumors of
treatment-naïve PCa patients who had undergone radical
prostatectomy. In the present study we extended these
findings. Screening of 78 benign and 89 malignant
patient samples revealed an induced PIAS1 expression
with increasing Gleason score (GSC) [low GSC, ≤7
(3 + 4); high GSC, ≥ 7 (4 + 3)] and tumor stage (Fig. 1A, B;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Our findings in primary PCa
samples were strengthened by including metastatic
lesions. Immunohistochemical analysis of lymph-node and
bone metastases revealed a significant increase in PIAS1
staining compared to benign tissue samples (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, when patients
were grouped according to tumor recurrence after initial treatment by radical prostatectomy, a significantly
elevated PIAS1 expression was observed in tissues
from individuals who experienced biochemical relapse
(defined by rising PSA levels) (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, to
evaluate the influence of docetaxel on PIAS1 expression,
a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of benign and
malignant prostate tissues of 14 PCa patients who
received docetaxel before radical prostatectomy, as
well as 14 matched treatment-naïve PCa patients [34]
was immunohistochemically stained. Semiquantitative
analysis revealed significantly increased PIAS1 protein
expression in malignant areas compared to corresponding
benign samples in both untreated as well as docetaxel
treated patient groups (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Docetaxel treatment had no influence on PIAS1 expression
in benign areas as assessed in a direct comparison between
both patient cohorts. Strikingly however, PIAS1 was
significantly elevated in malignant areas in the chemotherapy
group compared to the control group, which indicates a
direct influence of docetaxel treatment on PIAS1 expression
selectively in malignant tissues.

PIAS1 protein expression is increased in
docetaxel resistant cells
In order to complement our findings in patient tumor
samples we next investigated PIAS1 expression in docetaxel
resistant PC3 (PC3-DR) and DU145 (DU145-DR) cells.
These cell lines have been established and previously
characterized in our laboratory. Western blot analysis
revealed significantly increased PIAS1 protein expression in
both docetaxel insensitive cell lines (on average 2.5–3 fold
increase) compared to their parental counterparts (Fig. 1E).
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining
confirmed Western blot results (Fig. 1F, G). Up-regulation of

PIAS1 in cells treated with docetaxel seems to be restricted
to the development of resistance. Short-term treatment of
non-resistant cells with docetaxel caused an inhibitory effect
on PIAS1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Given that
PIAS1 itself may be regulated through cell cycle progression
[31], the observed effect might be due to the proliferative
arrest of parental cells in response to drug treatment.
Upregulation of PIAS1 in resistant cells is therefore a long
term effect. Consequently, we observed increased levels of
NFκB-p100 and two STAT family members, namely STAT3
and STAT5 (Supplementary Fig. S2B) in docetaxel resistant
DU145 compared to their parental counterparts, pointing
also to a switch in STAT signaling. Taken together, we
conclude from these findings that i) PIAS1 is over-expressed
in local and metastatic PCa; ii) PIAS1 expression is further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced in prostate tumors after chemotherapeutic treatment
with docetaxel; and iii) PCa cells, which survive docetaxel
treatment, have significantly elevated PIAS1 levels in vitro,
thereby suggesting an essential role for PIAS1 during PCa
progression and therapy resistance.

PIAS1 knockdown leads to reduced cell
proliferation by p21 up-regulation
As our data both from patient material and cell lines
revealed increased PIAS1 expression in malignant cells,
we next wanted to evaluate the functional significance of
PIAS1 and the potential application of PIAS1 knockdown
as a new therapy approach. In a previous publication [33]
we have already demonstrated that short term PIAS1 down

regulation (for 2–4 days) resulted in increased expression of
the cell cycle regulator p21 and, in consequence, in decreased
proliferation and colony formation ability of PC3, DU145,
and VCaP cells. However, under these settings no significant
increase in apoptosis was observed. In the present study we
were able to confirm and further extend these findings to
docetaxel resistant cells. Long term PIAS1 knockdown (for 6
days) using 2 specific PIAS1 siRNAs (siPIAS1-1, siPIAS1-3)
resulted in a significant decline in cell proliferation of parental
and docetaxel resistant PC3 and DU145 cells, as measured
by [3H]thymidine uptake and WST assay, respectively
(Fig. 2A, B). Reduced cell proliferation was accompanied
by elevated p21 levels (Fig 2C). PIAS1 knockdown and
p21 expression were controlled in all investigated cell lines
at mRNA and protein level by qRT-PCR and Western blot,
respectively (Fig. 2C). In addition, treatment with either
siRNA resulted in reduced cell numbers after 6 days (Fig. 2D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Due to the presence of a considerable number of
small and floating cells after treatment with specific
PIAS1 siRNAs (Fig. 2D), which indicates increased
apoptosis, we verified this hypothesis by measuring
the sub G1 fraction by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). We
confirmed an increase in apoptotic cells in both parental
as well as docetaxel resistant cell lines after PIAS1
depletion. However, the effect was more pronounced
in PC3 and PC3-DR cells. PIAS1 can modify protein
activation either by binding to target proteins via the
SAP domain, or by promoting SUMOylation via the
RLD/SIM motif. To test which domain is crucial for
cell survival, we performed transient over-expression of
PIAS1 with a wild type (WT) plasmid or PIAS1 constructs

knockdown for 3 days leads to reduced Mcl1 protein levels. However, Mcl1 down-regulation has no effect on PIAS1 expression in
PC3-DR and DU145-DR cells.

Elevated apoptosis upon PIAS1 down-regulation was
in addition confirmed by increased cPARP levels by Western
blot analysis in all investigated cell lines (Fig. 3C). PIAS1
knockdown also reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic
protein Mcl1(Fig. 3C). To uncover the hierarchical connection
between PIAS1 and Mcl1, we performed siRNA knockdown
and subsequent Western blot for both proteins. We observed
that PIAS1 knockdown influences Mcl1 expression; Mcl1
depletion, on the other hand, had no influence on PIAS1
levels in docetaxel resistant cells, indicating that PIAS1 is
upstream of Mcl1 (Fig. 3D). We have also asked whether
PIAS1 downregulation affects expression of other members
of the Bcl-2 family and found that expression of neither
Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL is constantly altered in both cell lines
following PIAS1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To test whether reduced Mcl1 levels after PIAS1 depletion
may be indeed sufficient to induce apoptosis, we measured
the percentage of sub-G1 cells after Mcl1 knockdown. Mcl1

or a point mutation in the sumo ligase domain (LD), or

protect PC3 and DU145 cells from docetaxel-induced
apoptosis, suggesting that elevated PIAS1 is not a cause
of chemotherapy resistance. In contrast to DU145, PC3
cells were sensitized to apoptosis in the presence of both
mutant PIAS1 plasmids. However, transfection with a
double mutant PIAS1 plasmid (LD-ΔSAP) resulted not
only in a significant increase in apoptosis in parental
cells, but was also sufficient to induce apoptosis in
both docetaxel resistant sub cell lines (Fig. 3B). These
results indicate that functional PIAS1 is a critical factor
for survival of treatment-naïve and docetaxel resistant
cancer cells. Furthermore, transfection with the LDΔSAP plasmid and treatment with docetaxel resulted in
an additive apoptotic effect in PC3 cells (Fig. 3B).

was similar in parental and resistant cells, however the
effect was more pronounced after PIAS1 downregulation
(Supplementary Fig. S3A-C).
Collectively, these data suggest that PIAS1
expression is crucial for survival of parental and docetaxel
resistant cells, as PIAS1 knockdown results in reduced cell
proliferation and elevated apoptosis.

of PC3-DR cells (Fig. 4D).
Moreover, semi-quantitative analysis of Mcl1

tissue. Docetaxel treatment had no influence on Mcl1
expression in benign samples. Strikingly however, Mcl1
protein was significantly induced in malignant areas of
the chemotherapy group compared to the control group
(Fig. 4E, F). Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of
lymph node and bone metastases revealed significantly
increased Mcl1 staining in metastatic lesions compared
to benign samples (Fig. 4E, F). Hence, we conclude that

findings in a mouse xenograft model. For this purpose, we
used PC3 and PC3-DR sub lines stably transfected with
shPIAS1-3 or shLuc as described above. For the PC3 as
well as for the PC3-DR xenograft experiments, the same
number of mice was randomly divided into four treatment
groups; shLuc-dox, shLuc+dox, shPIAS1-3-dox, and
shPIAS1-3+dox. After tumors had established, shPIAS1-3
or shLuc expression was induced by adding doxycycline
into the drinking water of the respective +dox groups. All
tumors in the 3 control groups constantly gained volume
over time. Strikingly however, PIAS1 knockdown in the
shPIAS1-3+dox group resulted in a complete abrogation
of tumor growth in both PC3 and PC3-DR xenografts and
was furthermore even sufficient to induce partial tumor
regression (Fig. 6A, B). Even more, 3 out of 7 mice in
the PC3 xenograft and 5 out of 7 mice in the PC3-DR
xenograft had no detectable tumor mass at the end of the
study, demonstrating complete tumor regression upon
PIAS1 knockdown. Determination of tumor volume and
weight at the end of the experiment revealed a significant
decrease in both parameters in tumors that arose from cells
where PIAS1 was depleted (Figure 6C, D). Subsequent
immunohistochemical staining of tumors confirmed
PIAS1 knockdown in the specific treatment group and
furthermore revealed decreased Mcl1, Ki67 and elevated
p21 expression compared to tumors of the control groups
(Fig. 6E, F; Supplementary Fig. S6).

PIAS1 knockdown influences tumor growth of
PC3 and PC3-DR CAM onplants
Having shown that PIAS1 knockdown results in
increased apoptosis in vitro, we next aimed to confirm our
findings in vivo. We therefore investigated consequences
of PIAS1 down-regulation on PC3 and PC3-DR tumor
growth in a CAM assay. For this purpose, we established
PC3 and PC3-DR sub lines containing a doxycycline
inducible GFP tagged shRNA vector targeting PIAS1
(shPIAS1-1, shPIAS1-3) or a control vector containing
shRNA against luciferase (shLuc). Possible toxic
side effects of doxycycline were excluded in control
experiments. Doxycycline up to a concentration of 4 μg/
ml had no influence on cell proliferation in PC3shLuc and
PC3-DRshLuc cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4). Both
PIAS1 shRNA sequences significantly reduced PIAS1
protein expression in PC3 and PC3-DR sub cell lines
which resulted in diminished cell proliferation. However,
the shPIAS1-3 sequence had a more pronounced antiproliferative effect in both tested cell lines. Activation
of the inducible system with 1 μg/ml doxycycline was
sufficient to reduce PIAS1 expression and, in consequence,
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5A-D).
Strikingly, PIAS1 knockdown for 6 days using the
shPIAS1-3 sequence and 1 μg/ml doxycycline resulted
in a significant reduction in cell proliferation and tumor
volume of PC3 (Fig. 5A, C) and PC3-DR (Fig. 5B, D)
onplants in the CAM experiment. These findings were
confirmed by a significantly reduced number of Ki67
positive cells in all shPIAS1-3 onplants and by reduced
PIAS1, Ki67, and Mcl1 immunoreactivity in PC3 as well
as in PC3-DR cells of the specific shPIAS1-3 treatment
group (Fig. 5A, B).

DISCUSSION
PIAS proteins are important regulators of many
cellular pathways by influencing the activity and stability
of target proteins through their SAP domain or SUMO E3
ligase activity. Therefore, a well-balanced expression of
PIAS proteins is critical for normal cell homeostasis and
their deregulation might be one reason for cancer initiation
or progression. However, the expression status and the
functional role of PIAS proteins in cancer, including PCa,
have not been investigated in detail yet. So far, Brantley
and colleagues could demonstrate that loss of PIAS3 leads
to enhanced proliferation in glioblastoma multiforme, while
Coppola et al. associated reduced expression of PIAS1
with colon cancer development [35, 36]. In contrast to
these findings, we observed elevated PIAS1 expression in
PCa and proposed a pro-proliferative role for the protein
in this malignancy, as PIAS1 was co-expressed with the
proliferation markers Ki67 and PCNA in PCa tissue [33].
Our observations were supported by findings of Li and
colleagues, who reported increased PIAS1 mRNA levels
in PCa samples [37]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that
PIAS1 is a co-activator of the androgen receptor (AR) and its
mRNA expression is up-regulated by androgenic hormones
[38, 39]. Thus, PIAS1 may in addition contribute to enhanced
proliferation or decreased apoptosis of PCa cells through
stimulation of AR activity in this malignancy. In future
studies, it may be of interest to evaluate the role of PIAS1

So far, we were able to demonstrate increased
PIAS1 levels in docetaxel treated patients and in docetaxel
resistant cell lines and proved that PIAS1 expression is
crucial for cancer cell survival. Finally, we translated these

in AR-positive docetaxel resistant PCa cells. However, the
attempts from the authors´ laboratory to generate such a
subline in vitro have not been successful so far.
To further extend our knowledge on PIAS1 and to
evaluate if PIAS1 targeting can improve current cancer
therapies, we performed a detailed analysis of PIAS1
expression and function in PCa. In our comprehensive
expression studies we evaluated PIAS1 levels in noncancerous prostate tissues, primary tumors of different
grades and stages, metastatic lesions, and chemotherapytreated tumor specimens (217 tissue samples in total), as
well as in parental and docetaxel resistant PCa cell lines. In
summary, tissue data presented in this manuscript confirm
that PIAS1 is over-expressed in local and metastatic PCa
and is, in addition, elevated in patients with biochemical
recurence after radical prostatectomy. Moreover, we
have proven for the first time that PIAS1 is even further
induced in tissue of docetaxel treated versus untreated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients as well as in docetaxel resistant cell lines.
We thus hypothesize that chemotherapeutic treatment
with docetaxel leads to a clonal selection of highly
proliferative cells with pronounced PIAS1 expression.
This assumption is supported by the fact that we already
have demonstrated a docetaxel-induced clonal selection
of highly proliferative and invasive docetaxel resistant
cancer cells that display a mesenchymal phenotype and
harbor stem cell-like properties [34]. Strikingly, functional
data of our in vitro and in vivo studies identify PIAS1
as a crucial factor for tumor cell survival since PIAS1
knockdown resulted in reduced proliferation and tumor
growth as well as increased apoptosis in parental and in
docetaxel resistant cells.
PIAS1 was originally identified as an inhibitor
of STAT1. It is well known that activated STAT factors
can regulate gene expression and thereby influence cell
differentiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.

In stress-induced responses they are activated by cytokine
signaling and modulate pro- and anti-apoptotic genes.
STAT1 was initially thought to be a tumor suppressor
as STAT1-deficient mice developed tumors and STAT1deficient cancer cells were found to be more resistant to
chemotherapy [40]. However, elevated STAT1 expression
was also associated with chemotherapy resistance in PCa
cells. Patterson and colleagues observed an increased STAT1
expression in docetaxel resistant DU145 cells and concluded
that high STAT1 levels in combination with elevated
clusterin expression are essential for docetaxel resistance
[41]. Partly, we were able to confirm these findings, given
that we also observed increased STAT1 and clusterin levels
in our own developed docetaxel resistant PC3 cells [34].
However, the mechanistic background as well as
functional consequences of altered STAT1 levels have not
been investigated so far. Based on our data we hypothesize
that elevated PIAS1 expression in docetaxel resistant cells
impairs transcriptional activity of STAT1 via inhibition
of its DNA binding ability. Therefore, these cells might
activate compensatory mechanisms, leading to increased
transcription of STAT1 and other STAT factors such as
STAT3 and STAT5 and in consequence to the upregulation
of anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. Mcl1, survivin or c-fos.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Indeed, in this study we found increased levels of STAT3
and STAT5 in DU145-DR compared to parental cells.
However, PC3 as well as PC3-DR cells are negative for both
proteins. Therefore, additional functional experiments are
warranted, including evaluation of STAT1 phosphorylation
at different sites and the interaction with other STAT family
members to uncover the specific role of STAT factors in
chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, one has to keep in
mind that PIAS1 functions are not limited to STAT factors.
PIAS1 already has been identified as a negative
regulator of tumor suppressors such as p53 and p73
[30–32]. Both proteins negatively influence cell
proliferation by directly activating cell cycle inhibitor p21
[31, 42]. In this context, we confirmed and were able to
extend our previous in vitro findings [33] by demonstrating
that transient and stable long term PIAS1 knockdown
(≥6 days) causes increased expression of p21 and, in
addition, a significant repression of the Bcl-2 family
member Mcl1. In consequence, this leads to reduced
proliferation and sensitization of parental and, importantly,
docetaxel resistant tumor cells to apoptosis. Interestingly,
over-expression of wild-type or mutant PIAS1 revealed
that the SAP- as well as the SUMO ligase domain have
to be inactive in order to successfully initiate apoptosis.

Cell culture and chemicals

This fact has to be considered in the development of future
PIAS1 inhibitors.
As Mcl1 seems to be influenced by PIAS1 we also
evaluated Mcl1 expression in docetaxel resistant cell lines,
in metastatic lesions, as well as in chemotherapy-naïve and
treated patients. Hence, we could not only demonstrate that
Mcl1 expression is elevated in primary and metastatic tumors
which confirms previous observations by Krajewska et al.
and Zhang et al. [43, 44], but were also able to demonstrate
that its expression, similar to that of PIAS1, is further
induced after docetaxel chemotherapy and in resistant cells.
In vitro, elevated Mcl1 levels have already been implicated
in resistance to cytokine-induced apoptosis and may also
be involved in the anti-apoptotic action of IL-6 [45], which
was also associated with chemotherapy resistance [26, 27].
Previously developed multi target inhibitors, like AT-101,
which targets several Bcl-2 family members including Mcl1,
have been tested in clinical studies, however, with modest
results. In a randomized phase I/II trial including 23 men
with chemotherapy- naïve CRPC, the administration of
AT-101 (20 mg/day for 21 of 28 days) resulted in reduced
PSA levels in some patients [46]. Nevertheless, in another
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial
including 221 men with progressive CRPC, treatment with
AT-101 in combination with docetaxel and prednisone did
not result in extended overall survival compared to standard
treatment plus placebo [47]. In this context, we speculate that
additional PIAS1 knockdown to standard treatment could
improve therapeutic outcome of CRPC patients as downregulation of PIAS1 in combination with docetaxel treatment
resulted in an additive apoptotic effect in PC3 cells in vitro.
However, a potential benefit of such a combined treatment
approach has to be evaluated employing additional cell lines
as well as in vivo models.
Taken together, our findings confirm that PIAS1
is over-expressed in PCa and show for the first time that
PIAS1 expression is significantly increased in docetaxel
resistant cells in vitro and in tissue of patients after
chemotherapy with docetaxel. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that PIAS1 is a crucial factor for survival of treatment-naïve
and docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells. PIAS1 downregulation causes elevated p21 and reduced Mcl1 levels,
which consequently results in increased cell death. On the
basis of the present data, we conclude that PIAS1 may be a
promising new target for treatment of primary, metastatic,
and chemotherapy resistant PCa.

PC3 and DU145 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD). Docetaxel resistant cell lines PC3-DR and DU145DR were cultured as described previously [34]. Cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and 20 mM glutamine. Representative
bright-field images of cells were taken using IC Capture
Software 2.2 with an Olympus CK2 microscope
(Olympus, Vienna, Austria) equipped with an Imaging
Source Camera DFK31F03 (Imaging Source, Bremen,
Germany). Identity of the used cell lines was confirmed
by short tandem repeat analysis.

Tissue microarray (TMA) and
immunohistochemistry
Evaluation of PIAS1 expression was performed
in 78 benign and 89 malignant tissues of PCa patients. To
investigate potential changes in PIAS1 and Mcl1 expression
following chemotherapy, a TMA of formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue blocks of 14 PCa patients who underwent
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel before radical
prostatectomy, as well as 14 matched of treatment-naïve
radical prostatectomy PCa patients was employed as
described in detail elsewhere [34]. In addition, TMAs
comprising bone and lymph-node metastases from 10 patients
were stained for PIAS1 and Mcl1 expression. The use of
archived material was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Innsbruck Medical University (Study no. AM 3174 including
amendment 2). Immunohistochemistry for PIAS1 and Mcl1
was performed on a Discovery - XT staining device (Ventana,
Tucson, AZ). The following antibodies were used: anti-PIAS1
(1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-Mcl1 (1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Additionally,
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded PC3, DU145, PC3DR, and DU145-DR were stained with anti-PIAS1 (1:400;
Abcam) and anti-Mcl1 (1:200; Santa Cruz). Images were
taken with a Zeiss Imager Z2 microscope (Zeiss, Vienna)
equipped with a Pixelink PL-B622-CU camera (Canimpex
Enterprises Ltd., Halifax, Canada). Immunohistochemical
evaluation was done by an uropathologist (G.S.) using the
semi-quantitative scoring system “quick score” combining
the proportion of positive cells and the average staining
intensity. PIAS1 and Mcl1 expression in PC3, DU145,
PC3-DR, and DU145-DR cells was quantified using the
HistoQuest 3.0 software (Tissue Gnostics, Vienna).

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection

[3H]thymidine incorporation, WST assay, and
apoptosis measurement

The following short interfering RNA sequences
were used for targeting human PIAS1 and Mcl1:
siPIAS1-1, 5′-AAGGUCAUUCUAGAGCUUUAdTdT-3′,
siPIAS1-3 5′-CGAAUGAACUUGGCAGAAAdTdT-3′,
and siMcl1 5′-GCAAGUGGCAAGAGGAUUAdtdt-3′.
A non targeting siRNA pool [Cat.nr.: D-001810-10-20,
Dharmacon, (Chicago, IL)] was used as a negative control.
siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. All cell lines were transfected with either 25 nM
of siRNAs against PIAS1, Mcl1, or non-targeting control.
To ensure sustained down-regulation of the target proteins
for 6 days, all cell lines were re-transfected with the
respective siRNA at day 3.

For [3H]thymidine incorporation and WST
assays, cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 103/well
in triplicates onto separate 96-well plates. For apoptosis
measurement, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105/
well onto 6-well plates. Cells were transfected twice in
a period of 6 days. Doxycycline inducible sub cell lines
were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline.
Thymidine incorporation was measured as previously
described [48]. As an index of cell proliferation and
viability a WST assay (Roche) was performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was assessed as previously described [33].

Biosystems, were used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

CAM assay
CAM assay was performed as described elsewhere
[50] with slight modifications. For onplant preparation,
native, non-pepsinized type I rat tail collagen (BD
Bioscience, Bedford, MA) was neutralized with 0.2 M
NaOH solution and mixed with 10 × DMEM medium.
5 × 105 PC3 or PC3-DR cells were added to 50 μL of this
solution. Collagen-onplants with or without doxycyclin (1
μg/ml) were applied to CAMs and incubated for 5 days.
Xenografts were analyzed under a stereomicroscope with a
digital camera (Olympus SZX10, Olympus E410, Vienna).
For histological analysis, onplants were excised from the
CAM, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for
paraffin sectioning and IHC. The following antibodies
were used: anti-PIAS1 (1:400; Abcam), anti-Mcl1 (1:200;

of the CAM tumors and Veronika Rauch for help with
viral infections. The authors also thank Dr. Bettina Schlick
for help with quantification of stained cells, as well as Dr.
Natalie Sampson, Dr. Holger Erb, and Dr. Petra Massoner
for helpful discussions.

Animal protocols were approved by the Austrian
Federal Ministry of Science (BMWF-66.011/0099II/3b/2012). All efforts were made to minimize suffering
of the animals. 4–6 weeks old male nude mice (BALB/
c/nu/nu) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Sulzfeld, Germany) and were housed under pathogenfree conditions. Xenograft tumors were grown by
subcutaneous implantation of a 100 μl (1:1) suspension of
2 × 106 PC3-shLuc and PC3-shPIAS1-3 cells or 1.5 × 106
PC3-DR-shLuc and PC3-DR-shPIAS1-3 cells mixed with
matrigel (BD Biosciences) into the right and the left flanks
of mice, respectively. For the PC3 as well as for the PC3DR xenograft experiment, the same amount of mice was
randomly divided into four treatment groups: shLuc-dox
(N = 5), shluc+dox (N = 5), shPIAS1-3-dox (N = 5), and
shPIAS1-3+dox (N = 7). Doxycycline was administered
at a concentration of 1g/l via drinking water after tumors
reached the volume of 50 mm3. Water bottles were changed
3 times a week. Tumor sizes were determined by caliper
measurements and calculated with the formula Volume =
(width)2 × length/2 at least once a week. Each tumor was
measured individually. After mice were sacrificed, tumors
were fixed in buffered formalin (4.5%) and embedded
in paraffin for further immunohistochemical staining.
The following antibodies were used: anti-PIAS1 (1:400;
Abcam), anti-Mcl1 (1:200; Santa Cruz), anti-Ki67 (1:100;
DAKO), and anti-p21 (1:100; Abcam).
