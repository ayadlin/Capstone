BACKGROUND. The survival of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia has
not improved. Few clinical trials have been available for older patients who are
not considered fit for an intensive chemotherapy approach.

METHODS. Between December 1998 and November 2003, as part of National Cancer Research Institute Acute Myeloid Leukemia 14 Trial, 217 patients, who were
deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy were randomized to receive low-dose
cytarabine (Ara-C) (20 mg twice daily for 10 days) or hydroxyurea with or without
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).
RESULTS. Low-dose ara-C produced a better remission rate (18% vs 1%; odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.06–0.37; P ¼ .00006) and better
overall survival (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P ¼ .0009), which was accounted for
by the achievement of complete remission (CR) (duration of CR: 80 weeks vs 10

he median age of patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) is 65 years. Results from several
collaborative group studies have confirmed that the
prognosis for older patients (>60 years) is unsatisfactory (<20% at 5 years; median survival, 9–12
months). Furthermore, those studies suggest that,
unlike the experience in younger patients, there has
been little improvement in survival in the last 2 decades. Such trials usually have offered an intensive
treatment approach, and it is by no means clear that
the patients recruited are representative of AML in
older patients. Thus, there is a substantial group of
older patients who are not entered into the clinical
trials on offer, as corroborated in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results data, which indicate
that only 30% of older patients with AML receive intensive chemotherapy.1 Among the several possible
reasons for their omission from trials is that older
patients are not considered fit for an intensive treatment approach. Instead, they will receive a treatment
approach that truly is palliative and is aimed at optimizing quality rather than quantity of life. Very few
randomized trials have been undertaken in this
patient group, with the result that there is no established treatment approach. The number of patients
with AML who require treatment will increase as the
general population in this age group increases, and
new chemotherapy agents are being developed that
may be useful for this group of patients.
In its 34-year history of clinical trials, the United
Kingdom Medical Research Council Leukaemia
Working Party has never devised a clinical trial for
older patients that offered any course other than an
intensive treatment approach; thus, trials were appliDr. J. A. Ademokun; Kent and Canterbury Hospital: Dr. C. F. E. Pocock; Kingston Hospital NHS

cable only to the selected group of patients who
were considered fit. The question of which patients
would benefit from being treated intensively or nonintensively remains important. Two previous studies
randomized patients between intensive and nonintensive treatments.2,3 Although the responses were
significantly better in intensively treated patients,
there was no significant difference in survival. This
reflects the dilemma, that, although greater intensity
may result in a higher remission rate, it is associated
with more nonleukemic deaths and, thus, no survival
advantage. In the United Kingdom National Cancer
Research Institute AML14 Trial, where there was
uncertainty, investigators could randomize patients
between an intensive approach and a nonintensive
approach; and, within each approach, additional randomizations were available. Among 1400 recruited
patients, only 8 patients were randomized between
the 2 approaches, suggesting that, for whatever reason, either patients or their physicians were clear
about which approach to adopt. Here, we report the
results of the randomized comparisons that were
undertaken in the nonintensive approach.
Low-dose (LD) cytarabine (Ara-C) has been used
in various schedules for several years, with several
Phase II trials in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) showing responses that included complete
remission (CR) of disease.4–11 It is well tolerated and
can be given in the outpatient or home care setting.
Its mechanism of action at low doses is not completely clear: Some believe that it retains cytotoxic
action, and some have view that it induces apoptosis
by differentiation induction.12,13 There is also a perception that LD ara-C induces excess cytopenia,

thereby defeating the objectively of being optimally
tolerable to the older patient. An alternative and
widely used approach is to provide best supportive
care, which includes blood product support and antibiotic treatment, as required with periodic treatment
with hydroxyurea (HU) to control the peripheral
white blood count.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment has revolutionized the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), in which the presence of the promyelocytic
leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor a fusion protein
denotes sensitivity. Various in vitro data have suggested that primary leukemic blast cells also can be
induced to differentiate.14,15 This is supported by anecdotal reports of patients with AML and MDS showing
a response to retinoid treatment as a single agent. Of
potential interest is the preclinical data indicating that
retinoid can sensitize leukemic blasts to ara-C, possibly
by shortening the half-life of BCL-2, thus increasing
the apoptotic stress.16–20 Because the overexpression of
BCL-2 has been suggested as a reason for resistance to
treatment, there is a rationale for combining ATRA
with chemotherapy in non-APL cases.21
Based on these issues and some nonrandomized
Phase II data,22 we designed a prospective randomized trial, Leukaemia Research Fund AML14, which
offered initial randomization to an intensive
approach or a nonintensive approach, and provided
further randomizations of both approaches. Here, we
report the nonintensive component of the trial. The
objective was to compare LD ara-C with HU, both
with supportive care, with respect to efficacy, toxicity,
and supportive care requirements. In addition,
patients would be randomized to receive or not to
receive ATRA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total, 1485 patients entered the trial, of whom
only 8 patients were randomized between the intensive approach and the nonintensive approach. Two
hundred twelve patients were not considered fit by
the local investigator for the intensive treatment
options and were randomized to receive the nonintensive approach. No specific criteria for defining
such patients were used, except that patients aged
<70 years should have a documented comorbidity
that precluded chemotherapy. Patients were primarily
aged >60 years, although younger patients could be
entered. Any type of AML (de novo or secondary)
and high-risk MDS (defined as >10% bone marrow
blasts) were eligible. APL and blast transformation of
chronic myeloid leukemia were excluded. The protocol was reviewed by the Clinical Trial Advisory Panel

of the Leukaemia Research Fund and was approved
by the Wales Multicentre Ethics Committee as well
as each institution’s ethical committee. The characteristics of all 1485 patients are shown in Table 1, split
by initial treatment type (intensive vs nonintensive).
Patients who entered the nonintensive approach were
significantly older, had a poorer performance score,
had more secondary disease, and had more heart disease and documented comorbid conditions. The
results of the intensive treatment randomizations will
be reported elsewhere.

Treatment
On entry, patients were allocated randomly to receive
LD ara-C 20mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection
for 10 days or HU sufficient to keep the white blood
cell count below 10 3 109/L. Subsequent courses of
LD-Ara-C were administered after intervals of 4 to 6
weeks. Patients also were randomized to receive
ATRA 45 mg/m2 per day for 60 days. Policies with
regard to blood product support, antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis, and treatment of febrile neutropenia were determined by established local practice.
Assessment of Response
CR
CR was defined by bone marrow aspiration, which
was required to consist of >50% normal cellularity
with evidence of trilineage maturation and <5%
bone marrow blasts, no evidence of extramedullary
disease, and regeneration of the peripheral neutrophil count to 1.0 3 109/L and the platelet count to
100 3 109/L. The persistence of myelodysplastic features did not exclude the diagnosis of CR.
Toxicity criteria
The maximum toxicities were recorded and graded
according version 2 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria.
Definitions of response endpoints
The following definitions also were used: overall survival (OS) is the time from randomization to death
from any cause; for remitters, disease-free survival
(DFS) is the time from CR to first event (either recurrence or death in CR).
Statistical Methods
Randomization was performed by telephone call to
the central trial office. Allocation was computer generated using minimization to ensure balance overall
and within stratification parameters: age groups
(ages <60 years, 60–64 years, 65–69 years, 70–74
years, and 75 years), World Health Organization

(WHO) performance status, white blood count
(<100 3 109/L, 100–199 3 109/L, 200 3 109/L), and
type of disease (de novo AML, secondary AML, MDS).
The primary endpoint was survival from randomization. The trial sample size was calculated on the basis that, to detect a 10% improvement in survival from
10% to 20% at 2 years, at a 2-tailed P value of .05. with
90% power, would require 200 patients per arm. The
trial was closed by the Trial Steering Committee in
November 2003 after a recommendation from the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee.

1117

For time to event endpoints, Kaplan-Meier life
tables were constructed and were compared by using
the log-rank test. Surviving patients were censored at
April 1, 2005, when follow-up was up to date for 99%
of patients (the 2 patients who were lost to follow-up
were censored at the date they were last known to be
alive).
Categorical endpoints (eg, CR rates) were compared
between arms by Fisher exact tests. Continuous variables (eg, blood counts and supportive care requirements) were analyzed by parametric tests (t tests) or
nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon) as appropriate.
Interactions between the 2 randomized comparisons were investigated by stratified analyses, ie, with
each comparison adjusted for the other, using tests
for heterogeneity over strata. In addition to the overall analyses of the randomized comparisons, subgroup analyses were performed by using the
predefined stratification parameters (see above);
although, because of the small numbers, some
groups were combined to give larger numbers and
greater statistical reliability (eg, performance status
scores of 2, 3, and 4 were grouped together). Tests
for heterogeneity of and/or trend in treatment effect
between subgroups were performed. Because of the
well-known dangers of subgroup analysis, all such
analyses are interpreted cautiously.
Odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated
for the main endpoints (CR and OS). For all endpoints, an OR/HR <1 indicated a benefit for LD araC over HU or for ATRA over no ATRA. All P values
are 2 tailed. All analyses were performed on the
intention to treat principle, with all patients analyzed
in their allocated arms, irrespective of whether or not
they actually received their allocated treatment.

RESULTS
Between December 1998 and November 2003, 1485
patients were entered into the trial overall; of these,
217 patients were entered into the nonintensive randomizations by 112 clinicians in 75 centers, including 129 patients with de novo AML, 58 patients with
secondary AML, and 30 patients with high-risk MDS.
The demographics of all patients recruited are provided in Table 1, which shows significant differences
in the characteristics of patients entering the intensive and nonintensive approaches. The outcome of
the intensive randomizations will be reported elsewhere. Among the patients who entered the nonintensive randomizations, the median age was 74 years
(range, 51–90 years), with 4 patients aged <60 years
and 165 patients aged >70 years. Two hundred two

*Risk was defined according to the criteria of Grimwade et al., 1999.23

patients were randomized between HU and LD ara-C,
and 207 patients were randomized between ATRA and
no ATRA. The baseline characteristics of the patients
were balanced well between the arms (Table 2).

Treatment Compliance
Of the patients who were allocated to receive LD ara-C
for whom data were available, 91% of patients received
at 1 dose: 36% received 1 course; 15% received 2
courses; 9% received 3 courses; and 31% received 4
courses. Of the 105 patients who were randomized to
receive ATRA, 90 received it for at 1 course.
Toxicity
The comparative toxicity is shown in Table 3. There
were no significant differences between the LD-AraC and HU arms or between the ATRA and no ATRA
arms. The toxicities observed in the first 8 weeks are
shown in Table 4.
Supportive Care
There were no substantial differences between any of
the treatment arms with respect to blood product
support, hospitalization, days on antibiotics, or day
case attendances to hospital (Table 5). There was a
small but significantly greater requirement for day
care visits for patients who received the second LD
ara-C course.
Disease Response
Overall outcome
The overall CR rate was 9% (19 of 217 patients). Survival of the entire nonintensive population was 13%
at 1 year, 4% at 2 years, and <1% at 3 years.

the mean time to CR for those who achieved it was
114 days (range, 50–313 days) for 6% of patients at
the end of Course 1, for 33% of patients after Course
2, for 44% of patients after Course 3, and for 17% of
patients after Course 4. The median disease-free survival for patients who achieved CR in the LD ara-C
arm was 8 months. Fifteen patients developed recurrent disease, of whom 14 died later, including 2
patients who died in CR (of cerebrovascular accident
and cardiac failure), and 1 patient remained in CR at
51 months after remission. In the ATRA comparison,
the CR rates were 12% with ATRA and 8% with no
ATRA (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.26–1.58; P ¼ .3).
OS
Survival with LD ara-C was better than with HU (OR,
0.60; 95% CI, 0.44–0.81; P ¼ .0009) (Fig. 1). ATRA
therapy did not improve survival overall or within either treatment arm (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.23;
P ¼ .6) (Fig. 2). There was no significant evidence of
interaction between HU/LD ara-C and ATRA (test for
heterogeneity; P ¼ .07) (Fig. 2).
In the LD ara-C arm, the achievement of CR was
related strongly to survival, with a median survival of
66 days in nonremitters compared with 575 days in
remitters (Fig. 3) (although, because remitters have
to live long enough to achieve CR, this comparison
does inflate the difference).
Subgroup analysis
There was no clear evidence that the beneficial effect
of LD ara-C, compared was HU, was restricted to
any particular type of patient (Fig. 4), although no
remissions were observed in patients with adverse
cytogenetics, which had an impact on the OS of the

Similar treatment effects were observed for all ages,
levels of white blood cells, and disease types. The
number of patients with a poor performance status
(WHO grades 3 and 4) was small, but there was
some evidence that they did not benefit (test for
trend; P ¼ .009). However, there was a correlation
between patients who had adverse cytogenetics and
a poor performance score—the great majority of
these patients died early (mean survival, 11 days).
Older patients (aged >75 years) derived benefit from
LD ara-C similar to that of younger patients (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
The treatment outcome for all older patients with
AML is unsatisfactory and has not improved significantly over the last 2 decades in spite of improved

supportive care. Most treatment offered in the context of collaborative group clinical trials is intensive
chemotherapy, but there is a substantial group of
older patients that does not enter such trials either
because they decline or because they are not considered fit enough. They are a neglected group; and, as
the population demographics change, there will be a
greater number of such patients. With this in mind,
our study group conducted 1 of few randomized studies in this subgroup of patients.

LD ara-C was investigated extensively >20 years
ago and is a familiar and practical schedule for older
patients. Virtually all studies were nonrandomized
and involved small patient numbers. The response to
ara-C is dose dependent over a large dose range, and
several LD schedules have been used, all of which
can show at least some activity. It has never been
demonstrated definitively that LD ara-C has its effect
in patients because of the induction of differentiation
or because of cytotoxicity, although the protracted

time taken to respond and the preclinical data may
support a differentiation mechanism. Conversely, in
some studies, usually with the higher dose or longer
duration schedules, a period of hypoplasia seemed to
be associated with a greater prospect of response.
There is no established LD schedule, and our selection of 20 mg twice daily for 10 days was not anticipated to cause extra toxicity in the subset of patients

we examined. LD ara-C has not been adopted universally, because some studies reported cytopenia.
Although this may be a prerequisite for efficacy, our
data do not indicate any excess toxicity or increased
transfusion or other supportive care requirements
compared with HU. Small nonrandomized studies in
the literature suggest that between 10% and 20% of
patients will achieve CR. This finding was reproduced in the current study. Although the number of
patients with high-risk MDS that would have been
defined as refractory anemia with excess blasts
(RAEB) and RAEB in transformation was small, 1 of 5
patients achieved a CR. Among the patients with
AML, 13 of 71 achieved CR, for an overall CR rate of
18%, whereas only 1 patient on the HU arm achieved
CR. It is noteworthy that the time to CR was quite
variable and could lend support to the argument
supporting differentiation induction as the mechanism of response. Because patients were able to
achieve CR, survival in the LD-Ara-C was highly significantly better than survival in the HU arm.
Patients of all age groups derived benefit, but it was
noticeable that no patient with adverse cytogenetics

achieved CR. We could find no evidence of benefit
for patients unless they obtained CR, which is a wellestablished principle in AML treatment. Patients who
achieved CR had a median survival of 80 weeks compared with 18 weeks if CR was not achieved.
The preclinical rationale for examining the addition of ATRA in this patient group was attractive.
Because the overexpression of BCL-2 has been proposed as a mechanism of resistance to treatment
and is relatively common in AML, the potential to
improve sensitivity to ara-C or HU was worth testing.
In vitro data also suggested that differentiation could
be induced with ATRA in non-APL blasts. In the this
study, we observed no effect from the addition of
ATRA to either of the treatment arms. Other studies
of ours are similarly negative with the sequencing
that we used.
The basis on which patients are not considered
fit for an intensive or a nonintensive approach to
treatment is not clear. This is a well-recognized but
ill-defined patient group. Traditionally, fitness or lack

of fitness have been determined according to chronologic age, performance score, secondary disease,
and the presence of comorbidity. In this trial, these
characteristics are more frequent but are not exclusive to the patients who received the nonintensive
approach. In addition, these characteristics do not
seem to be sensitive enough on their own to dictate
who may or may not benefit from a particular
approach, so other parameters need to be identified
that predict at diagnosis which patients are at risk of
early mortality with an intensive treatment approach.
Within this trial, it was clear from a multivariate
analysis that a significant factor was the physician
involved. Little work has been done in older patients
with leukemia in this area, although various scoring
systems are available in the elderly for other medical
interventions. This issue will become even more relevant as this patient group is targeted as suitable for
new drug development. In the absence of randomized data, it is not possible to be sure which
approach is correct.
Although a very significant benefit in survival
has been demonstrated with ara-C compared with
HU, the outlook for patients who receive low-dose
ara-C remains unsatisfactory. However, it can repre-

sent a baseline against which other promising treatments may be compared either alone or in addition
to low-dose ara-C. Equally important will be the development of objective criteria with which to define
patients who are unfit for intensive treatment. Some
have suggested that this is defined as a 30% to 50%
chance of mortality at 8 weeks and have presented
prognostic factors that may define such patients.24
This represents an important and growing subgroup
of patients who have been neglected somewhat in
trial protocols.
