Abstract

Author Manuscript

The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is a major player in multiple physiological responses
including growth, survival and differentiation. Overexpression and/or oncogenic mutation in the
Src gene have been documented in human tumors. The v-Src protein is an oncogenic mutant of
Src, which promotes cell survival, migration, invasion and division. GRIM-19 is an anti-oncogene
isolated using a genome-wide knockdown screen. GRIM-19 binds to transcription factor STAT3
and ablates its pro-oncogenic effects while v-Src activates STAT3 to promote its oncogenic
effects. However, we found that GRIM-19 inhibits the pro-oncogenic effects of v-Src
independently of STAT3. Here, we report the identification of functionally inactivating GRIM-19
mutations in a set of Head and Neck cancer patients. While wild-type GRIM-19 strongly ablated
v-Src-induced cell migration, cytoskeletal remodeling and tumor metastasis, the tumor-derived
mutants (L71P, L91P and A95T) did not. These mutants were also incapable of inhibiting the drug
resistance of v-Src-transformed cells. v-Src down regulated the expression of Pag1, a lipid raftassociated inhibitor of Src, which was restored by wild-type GRIM-19. The tumor-derived mutant
GRIM-19 proteins failed to upregulate Pag1. These studies show a novel mechanism that
deregulates Src activity in cancer cells.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The Src family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs) regulates a number of
cellular processes including growth factor and immune receptor signaling, metabolic
responses, cell survival, and cell motility (1). The v-Src (viral) and c-Src (cellular) proteins
differ in their carboxyl termini, with the former lacking 11 of the c-terminal most amino
acids that fold to form an auto-inhibitory domain (1). Constitutive phosphorylation of a
tyrosine residue in this region, Y530 (human)/Y535 (rodent) by the C-terminal Src kinase
(Csk), renders the enzyme inactive. Dephosphorylation of this tyrosine residue sets the stage
for autophosphorylation of Y419 (human)/Y424 (rodent), in the kinase domain and a superactivation of its kinase function (1). As a result, v-Src escapes the negative regulation by
Csk (2). v-Src phosphorylates a number of proteins associated with plasma membrane,
cytoskeleton, adherens junctions, proteins involved in cell migration, invasion, proliferation,
survival and transcription machinery (1).

Author Manuscript

Earlier, we employed a genome-wide knockdown screen and discovered the Genesassociated with Retinoid-IFN induced Mortality (GRIM), which conferred a growth
advantage to cells following their knockdown (3). GRIM-19 was one such gene product,
whose overexpression caused growth arrest and/or apoptosis (4). One of the major targets of
GRIM-19 is transcription factor STAT3 (5, 6). STAT3 is transiently activated via tyrosyl
phosphorylation by the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) which are recruited to the cytokineengaged receptors (7). In tumors, STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated by activated/
mutated oncogenic tyrosine kinases, such as v-src (8, 9). Under these conditions, STAT3
induces the expression of many gene products involved in promoting cell growth, invasion
and suppression of apoptosis (10). We have shown earlier that GRIM-19 inhibits v-Srcinduced cellular transformation (11), involving remodeling of actin cytoskeleton in a
STAT3-independent manner (12).
Here, we describe three functionally inactivating somatic mutations in the GRIM-19 gene
from primary human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which unlike the wild type were
inefficient at suppressing v-Src-induced cellular transformation, tumor growth, cytoskeletal
remodeling and metastatic behavior. The v-Src oncoprotein suppressed the expression level
of lipid raft-associated protein Cbp/Pag1; an inhibitor of Src. Wild-type GRIM-19 overrode
v-Src-induced repression of Pag1 and rescued Pag1 levels thereby enforcing growth
suppression. The tumor-derived GRIM-19 mutants failed to rescue Pag1 levels. These
results identify a novel anti-oncogene regulatory mechanism and its deregulation in cancers.

Identification of mutations in GRIM-19 gene from human oral SCC
We recently obtained a set of human oral SCC samples from individuals who were longterm tobacco users. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from pathologist-certified
surgically isolated tumors and adjacent normal tissues. Real-time PCR analyses showed
GRIM-19 mRNA levels in some of the tumors was higher compared to their matched normal
tissue (Fig. 1A). Since GRIM-19 was an inhibitor of cell growth, we were surprised by this
inverse correlation between its expression and tumor formation. Sequencing of GRIM-19

cDNA from tumors and matched normals identified three separate base changes in the
GRIM-19 mRNA from tumors (Fig. S1). Their somatic origin was ascertained by a genomic
sequence comparison from a matched normal tissue. These GRIM-19 mutants were from
patients with poorly differentiated lymph node metastases. These mutants L71P, L91P and
A95T were cloned into expression vectors to determine their biological effects on v-Srcinduced oncogenesis.
GRIM-19 mutants fail to block v-Src-induced cellular transformation

Author Manuscript

To study the biological effects, GRIM-19 (mutants and wild type) expression vectors were
transfected into 3Y1 cell line that stably expressed v-Src. After verifying their comparable
expression (Fig. 1B), we analyzed their effect on v-Src-induced anchorage independent
growth in soft agar medium. Control vector-transfected 3Y1 cells (EV) did not form
significant colonies (>25 μm diameter) while v-Src-expressing cells formed large sized
colonies (ranging from 90μm to 1mm) (Fig. 1C). In the presence of wild-type GRIM-19,
fewer colonies formed with an average colony diameter ~70μm. In the presence of mutant
GRIM-19 proteins, v-Src promoted the formation of several large colonies (200μm to
900μm). Thus, all three GRIM-19 mutants failed to inhibit anchorage-independent growth
like wild-type GRIM-19 (Fig. 1D).
GRIM-19 mutants are incapable of blocking v-Src-induced cell motility

Author Manuscript

We next tested if these GRIM-19 mutants had any differential effect on v-Src-dependent
motility using a wound scratch model. Confluent monolayers of cells expressing v-Src and
GRIM-19 were scratched to generate a denuded area in the monolayer to permit cell
movement. A large number of v-Src-expressing cells moved into the denuded area by 4h,
compared to the control vector (EV) transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Such motility was ablated in
the presence of wild-type GRIM-19. All three mutants significantly (p<0.001) lost their
ability to block v-Src-induced motility compared to wild-type GRIM-19 (Fig. 2B). The L71P
and A95T mutants nearly lost all of their capacity to block v-Src in this assay while L91P
mutant was intermediary between wild-type GRIM-19 and v-Src.
GRIM-19 mutants do not block v-Src-dependent glucose consumption

Author Manuscript

Since most rapidly growing cancer cells utilize glucose for biosynthetic processes, we
wanted to determine if GRIM-19 had an effect on glucose metabolism. Equal numbers of
cells expressing v-Src in the absence and presence of GRIM-19 proteins were grown in
DMEM (high glucose) for 72h and select parameters were assayed in the spent medium.
Glucose levels depleted strongly in media from v-Src-expressing cells, which was
significantly (p<0.01) suppressed in presence of wild-type GRIM-19 (Fig. 3A). The mutants,
however, were unable to prevent glucose depletion. Low glucose levels in the medium
correlated inversely with lactic acid levels (Fig. 3B). The v-Src-induced rise in lactic acid
levels was well controlled by wild-type GRIM-19 but not by the mutants. These metabolic
alterations also reflected in corresponding changes in pH of the growth medium (Fig. 3C). In
light of these observations, we checked for the presence and levels of pyruvate kinase (PK)
isoforms M1 and M2 in these cells using qPCR. M1 is seen in most adult cells while M2 is
expressed mainly during embryogenesis. Expression of PKM2 isoform was correlated with a

shift towards increased glycolysis and transformed state of cells (13). In these cells, only
Pkm2 transcript was found (see below). When compared to EV, the v-Src-expressing cells
had a significant increase in Pkm2 levels, which was lowered by wild-type GRIM-19 (Fig.
3D). The mutant GRIM-19 proteins were unable to suppress Pkm2 transcript levels like the
wild type. Pkm2 transcript levels in mutant-expressing cells were comparable to that of vSrc-expressing cells. Since an invariant PCR primer was used in this analysis, we ensured
that the product observed in these reactions contained only Pkm2 by performing a restriction
analysis. The Xho I and Sfo I restriction enzymes sites, present in the alternate exon 9, are
specific to Pkm1 and Pkm2 transcripts, respectively (Fig. 3E left panel). The product was
digested only by Sfo I but not by Xho I (Fig. 3E right panel). The Kpn I digestion served as
marker to show that the product is indeed Pkm.
Tumor-derived GRIM-19 mutants cannot restrain v-Src-induced cytoskeletal remodeling

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Most normal cells retain a well-spread shape when attached to a substratum, which could be
observed in the parental 3Y1 cell line. Although adherent, a greater number of v-Srctransformed cells appeared rounded under light microscope (Fig. S2). Such a change is
required for motility and invasion, by disrupting actin stress fibers. As reported in our earlier
study (12), expression of wild-type GRIM-19 reverted the cell shape of v-Src-transformed
3Y1 cells similar to that of naive 3Y1 cells. Unlike this, mutant-expressing cells appeared
more like v-Src-expressing cells. Therefore, we next examined the influence of GRIM-19
and tumor-derived mutants on cytoskeletal reorganization caused by v-Src. Phalloidin
staining revealed that in control vector-transfected cells, only actin stress fibers were seen,
while in v-Src-expressing cells, they were completely absent and actin localized to discrete
lamellipodium-filopodium-like structures or densely to rosette-like structures resembling
podosomes (Fig. 4A). In the presence of wild-type GRIM-19, a moderate levels of stress
fibers reappeared with a decline in lamellipodium-filopodium-like structures (Fig. 4A). In
contrast, mutant-expressing cells had a complete absence of actin stress fibers with several
lamellipodium-filopodium-like structures. Similar data were observed when cells were
stained with cortactin (Fig. S3). The ability of the same GRIM-19 mutants to affect
cytoskeletal organization was also examined in an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line,
HSC3, which expresses a very low level of GRIM-19. Similar to the observations in 3Y1
cells, expression of wild-type GRIM-19 suppressed lamellipodium-filopodium-like
structures in HSC3 cells (Fig. S4). The mutants, however, lost such ability. Taken together,
these observations show that GRIM-19 ablates v-Src-induced cytoskeletal reorganization
and tumor-derived mutants are incapable of exerting such effects.

Author Manuscript

Since v-Src induces the phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins involved in
cytoskeletal organization, we investigated if GRIM-19 blocked these events to retain a
normal cell shape. Western blot analyses with antibodies that could detect site-specific
tyrosyl phosphorylation in proteins involved in cell adhesion and F-actin regulation, FAK,
paxillin and cortactin, showed a significant increase in their tyrosyl phosphorylated levels in
v-Src-expressing cells, compared to control vector transfected ones. In presence of wild-type
GRIM-19, these three proteins were not phosphorylated to a high level (Fig. 4B). In
contrast, all three mutants lost the capacity to block v-Src-mediated phosphorylation of
FAK, paxillin and cortactin (Fig. 4B). The L71P mutant was completely ineffective at

blocking phosphorylation of FAK or cortactin or paxillin, which was either comparable or
higher than v-Src-expressing cells while mutants L91P and A95T moderately inhibited v-Src
activity. Thus, among the mutants a differential inhibition of v-Src activity was evident and
even the strongest GRIM-19 mutant was still far less efficient compared to wild-type
GRIM-19. Lastly, GRIM-19 mutants also failed block src-induced tyrosylphosphorylation of
transcription factor STAT3 and gene expression (Fig. S5), unlike the wild-type protein.
GRIM-19 mutants failed to suppress v-Src-induced growth and metastatic spread of tumor
cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To address if the mutants lost the capacity to suppress tumor growth in vivo, nude mice were
injected with v-Src-transformed cells co-expressing GRIM-19 (wild type or mutants). At the
end of four weeks, differences in tumor size among the mutants were clearly observed (L71P
> L91P > A95T) that were much bigger compared to wild-type GRIM-19 which continued
till the end of seven weeks (Fig. 5A). These differences were highly significant (p<0.001).
Thus, the mutants were incapable of suppressing v-Src-induced tumor growth in vivo. Next,
we addressed if these mutants influenced metastasis. Cells expressing v-Src and GRIM-19
were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing fire-fly luciferase and injected
subcutaneously in the lower flank of nude mice. Metastatic spread of cells was monitored
using a live imaging system. Control vector-transfected cells did not grow or move from the
site of injection while v-Src-expressing cells grew and spread to adjacent areas (Fig. 5B).
Wild-type GRIM-19-expressing cells grew slightly but did not spread like v-Src-expressing
cells. Metastases were mostly located in the retroperitoneum, with lower frequencies in the
vertebral bodies, liver and spleen. The L71P and L91P mutants, on other hand, failed to block
metastatic spread of cells to different parts of the body. The most robust cell spread was
observed with cells expressing v-Src/L71P followed by v-Src/L91P. The A95T expressing
cells moved weakly compared to the other two GRIM-19 mutants, consistent with its
relatively better growth-suppressive effects compared to the other mutants (Fig. 5C).
Mechanism of the anti-v-Src effects of GRIM-19

Author Manuscript

To define mechanism(s) of the anti-Src effects of wild-type GRIM-19, we first assessed
Y416-Src phosphorylation in cells expressing v-Src and GRIM-19. As expected, tyrosyl
phosphorylation of Src was readily seen in v-Src-expressing cells compared to the EV cells
(Fig. 6A). Active Src (Y416-phosphorylation) levels were the lowest in wild-type GRIM-19expressing cells, while they were highest in L71P mutant-expressing cells followed by A95T
and L91P. Thus, the increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src substrates in presence of
GRIM-19 mutants (see Figs. 4 and S5) appears to be due to a failure to block v-Src kinase
activity. Initial experiments did not provide evidence for a direct interaction between
GRIM-19 and v-Src (data not shown). Therefore, we hypothesized that GRIM-19 might
activate the expression of a Src inhibitor and the mutants were incapable of doing so.
A CSK-binding protein associated with lipid rafts (Cbp/Pag1) could independently suppress
v-Src activity as shown by an increased susceptibility of Pag1−/− MEFs to v-Src-induced
transformation (14). Therefore, we examined if v-Src affected Pag1 expression level and a
role for GRIM-19 in this process. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a strong reduction in
Pag1 mRNA level in the presence of v-Src (Fig. 6B), which was restored to near normal

levels in presence of wild-type GRIM-19. The mutants on the other hand failed to counter
the repressive effect of v-Src on Pag1 expression levels. Thus, Pag1 appears to act as a
GRIM-19-responsive v-Src inhibitor to suppress tumor cell growth. Consistent with the
qPCR data, v-Src suppressed Pag1 protein levels. Such repression was countered by wildtype GRIM-19 and increased it above the Pag1 levels found in EV cells (Fig. 6C). To
ascertain the role of GRIM-19 in the upregulation of Pag1, we transduced v-Src/GRIM-19
expressing cells with lentiviral particles coding for either scrambled or GRIM-19-specific
shRNA (sh-G). After ensuring the specific depletion of GRIM-19 by sh-G (Fig. 6D), we
examined if Pag1 levels were affected using a Western blot analysis. Indeed, depletion of
wild-type GRIM-19 lead to a decline in Pag1 levels, similar to those found in v-src
transformed cells (Fig. 6E). As expected, depletion of the mutants using the same approach
did not significantly alter Pag1 levels, because Pag1 is already low in these cells. Consistent
with the loss of GRIM-19 and the consequent loss of Pag1 levels, v-src activity rose up, that
was reflected by a rise in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 6F). The biological
relevance of these observations was ensured by measuring cell motility using a Transwell
migration assay (Fig. 6G). As expected higher numbers of v-src transformed cells rapidly
moved to the bottom side of the Transwell chambers (where mitogens are present) when
compared to the EV cells. In presence of GRIM-19 cell motility is blocked strongly, which
was reversed following the knockdown of GRIM-19 (Fig. 6G). Similar knockdown in
mutant expressing cells did not significantly alter cell motility. Taken together these data
indicate an important role for GRIM-19 in maintaining PAG1 levels to blunt v-src activity.

Author Manuscript

Lastly, to determine the relevance of Pag1 to GRIM-19 mediated inhibition of v-Src, we
knocked down Pag1 using a specific shRNA (sh-Pag1), expressed from a lentiviral vector.
We used v-Src and v-Src/WT cell lines for this study (Fig. 6H). The sh-Pag1 knocked down
the expression of Pag1 >82%, compared to the sh-Scr control in the v-Src/WT cells. As
Pag1 is undetectable in presence of v-Src alone, sh-Pag1 did not affect it in the v-Src cells.
Following the loss of Pag1, v-Src activity and FAK1 phosphorylation were significantly
increased in v-Src/WT cells. Fig. 6I shows the quantified data from the Western blots.
Lastly, the v-Src/WT ells acquired the capacity to form soft-agar colonies in presence of shPag1, compared to the control (Fig. 6J–K). As expected, sh-Pag1 did not affect colony
formation in the v-Src cells. Thus, loss of either GRIM-19 or Pag1 produced a similar
stimulatory effect on v-Src activity in these cells, indicating a major role for Pag1 in
mediating anti-Src activity of GRIM-19.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The Src proto-oncogene is hyperactivated either due to mutation/over expression or due to
constitutive activity of mutated growth factor receptors (1). Src plays a critical role in cell
survival (15) and bone metastasis of certain cancers (16) by phosphorylating multiple
cellular proteins involved in survival, motility, invasion and cytoskeletal organization. Src
activity in normal cells is restrained by a protein tyrosine kinase Csk that phosphorylates the
c-terminal Y530/535 residue (2, 17, 18).
As mentioned earlier, GRIM-19 inhibits transcription factor STAT3 (5). We and others have
shown that GRIM-19 (RNA and protein) expression is down regulated in a variety of human

primary tumors compared to their matched normal tissue, including kidney (19), prostate
(20), cervical (21), lung (22), gastro-intestinal (23) and brain (24) cancers. Here we
described inactivating GRIM-19 mutations in SCC. Public databases (NCBI and
ENSEMBL) have many entries for SNPs in GRIM-19 linked to a sequencing project at the
Johns Hopkins University, although no disease annotations are available. Interestingly,
mutations in codons (71 and 91 for leucine) described in this study, are also found in these
public databases. Both these mutations have lost their ability to block v-Src. These residues
are conserved in GRIM-19 of human, mouse, rat, cow and Xenopus probably indicating an
important function. Together, these mutations define a potential domain within GRIM-19
required for exerting anti-metastatic functions.

Compared to wild-type GRIM-19, the mutants displayed moderate to severe loss of antitumor functions (Figs. 2–5). Despite some quantitative differences, the net effect was as
inability to block v-Src induced growth in vivo. Importantly, these mutants could not restore
actin stress fibers and failed to block anchorage-independent growth. Focal adhesions
typically contain integrins, Fak, Src and actin-anchoring proteins which are necessary for
cell migration (25). Podosomes are actin-rich cell membrane protrusions that play a role in
cell motility (26). Clustering of podosomes result in rosette-like or belt-shaped structures
associated with extracellular matrix-degrading protease activity (26). Many invasive cancer
cells display both these features in addition to high levels of active Src and phosphorylated
FAK. An important actin regulator in podosomes is cortactin. Cortactin has a higher affinity
for the nodes in a branched actin network (27, 28). Upon phosphorylation by Src, cortactin
loses such affinity allowing actin to be remodeled by other regulators. A high level of
phosphorylated cortactin is seen in invasive gastro-intestinal tumors along with high levels
of active Src and phosphorylated FAK often associated with a poor prognosis (29). Cortactin
is frequently over expressed in a number of metastatic tumors (28, 30, 31) and particularly in
a high percentage of primary aggressive oral SCCs (32). Within the head and neck
squamous carcinomas, Src/FAK overexpression is associated with poor prognosis (33, 34).
In Betel-Quid induced oral squamous cell carcinoma, src activation plays prominent in
tumor cell invasion (35). In other experimental models, combined treatment of HNSCC with
SFK and EGFR inhibitor yielded better tumor suppression, indicating an important role for
Src in tumor growth (36). Therefore, the metastatic behavior of v-Src-expressing cells (Fig.
6) and a critical role played by GRIM-19 in controlling cancer growth can be envisaged in
light of these reports. GRIM-19 blocked v-Src-mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of
cortactin, a critical event in the remodeling of the actin network. This is a transcriptionindependent event given there was no change in total Cttn levels (data not shown) under the
conditions of either v-Src or v-Src/GRIM-19 expression. Thus, GRIM-19 alters posttranslational events involved in cortactin function. We have shown earlier that the anti-Src
effects of GRIM-19 are exerted independently of STAT3 (12). The growth patterns of v-src/
GRIM-19 mutants are also consistent with relatively higher glucose uptake, compared to
wild-type GRIM-19 protein under the same conditions in vitro (Fig. 3). It has been shown
earlier that Src can induce the expression of glucose transporters and hexokinases (37–39).
Together these data show a broader effect of GRIM-19 on v-Src-induced oncogenic
alterations. Most advanced tumor cells depend heavily on aerobic glycolysis (40) to meet
their high energy demands. One change that corresponds to the inefficient glucose

metabolism in these cells is the rise in Pkm2 transcript following v-Src expression, which
was suppressed by wild type, but not by the mutant GRIM-19 proteins. Interestingly, these
cells did not express Pkm1 transcript at all, indicating that in 3Y1 cells PKM2 is the only
source of PK.

Since a v-Src/GRIM-19 complex could not be detected, we hypothesized that GRIM-19
might engage an inhibitory protein for suppressing v-Src activity. Although the first suspect
would be Csk, v-Src lacks its target site and cannot explain the inhibitory effects of
GRIM-19. A novel Src inhibitory mechanism operates through a protein called Csk-binding
protein (Cbp), also known as phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched
microdomains 1 (Pag1). Interaction of Pag1-Csk, in lipid rafts, promoted Src inactivation by
phosphorylating Y530/535 residue. (41). This is an attractive mechanism but cannot explain
anti-v-Src effects of GRIM-19, because it lacks Y530/535. However, a recent study has
shown that Cbp/Pag1 itself inhibits Src activity independently of Csk (14). Cbp binds to the
SH2 domain of active Src and arrests it in lipid rafts to prevent its oncogenic effects. The
Pag1−/− MEFs are readily transformed by v-Src, which can be suppressed by
complementing with Pag1 expression. Importantly, CBP/PAG1 mRNA is down regulated in
tumor cells expressing active Src (14). Consistent with the latter observation, we observed a
down regulation of Pag1 in v-Src-expressing 3Y1 cells, which was regained in presence of
wild-type GRIM-19 (Fig. 6) but not in presence of the mutant GRIM-19. RNAi-mediated
knockdown of either GRIM-19 or Pag1 in cells expressing v-Src/GRIM-19 resulted in a
resumption of v-Src activity, tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK and increased cell motility and
soft-agar colony formation. These observations are consistent with their lack of control over
v-Src and a failure to restore Pag1 expression. In summary, Pag1 re-expression in presence
of GRIM-19 appears to be a potential mechanism of v-Src inhibition. A portion of GRIM-19
is also present mitochondrion(42), where it appears to control electron transport chain I
activity (43), which could generate reactive oxygen species (44). SFK activity is also
regulated by redox control mechanisms through cysteine oxidation (45). Whether redox
activities also contribute to the anti-src activities of GRIM-19, remains to be investigated.

Author Manuscript

v-Src neither affected Pag1 mRNA stability nor the luciferase activity driven by Pag1
promoter in their experiments, which we were able to confirm (data not shown). Recently,
the v-Src, Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras oncoproteins were reported to suppress Pag1 gene expression
through a MAP kinase-dependent histone deacetylation (46). Although a role for HDAC1 is
suggested in the Pag1 repression (46), the exact nuclear factors targeted by v-src are still
unknown. It is likely that GRIM-19 blocks such processes for upregulating Pag1, given its
nuclear presence (4). There are no known STAT3 binding sites in the Pag1 promoter (data
not shown) to suggest that STAT3 inhibits Pag1 transcription and GRIM-19 reverses it.
Furthermore, we have shown that GRIM-19 inactivation of v-Src activity occurs
independently of STAT3 (12). Future studies are required to resolve the factors targeted by
v-Src in repressing Pag1 and how GRIM-19 affects them. A similar negative regulation of
Pag1 occurred in presence of EGF and PDGF(46). Based on these observations, we believe
that GRIM-19 operates a negative regulatory loop by restoring Pag1 levels which block the
oncogenic effects of v-Src. Lastly, cells expressing v-Src are highly resistant to inhibition by
chemotherapeutics, which was blunted in cells expressing GRIM-19. Mutant GRIM-19

proteins, described here, were unable to block v-Src-induced chemoresistance suggesting
their pathological importance (data not presented). These GRIM-19 mutants may serve as
guides to co-treat tumors harboring them with Src inhibitors in addition to standard
chemotherapeutics, to achieve an optimal suppression. However, a systematic large-scale
analysis of the relevance of the mutations reported here to human primary oral SCC
diagnosis and therapy is still required, which is beyond the scope of current study.

Primers used for cloning GRIM-19 ORF are shown in Table S1. Expression-positive cell
pools (>50 colonies per transfection) were used to generate stable population that were used
in all experiments. Lentiviral expression vectors coding for GRIM-19- and Cbp/Pag1specific shRNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems, Inc. A scrambled shRNA
expression vector was used as a control in each case. Lentiviral particles expressing either
the shRNAs or the GRIM-19 mutants were generated as described in our earlier
publications.
Immunofluorescence
To visualize F-actin network and nuclei, Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen)
and DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) were used, respectively. GRIM-19 (wild type and mutants) were
visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-Myc IgG. Images were captured using

a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-FLA) fitted with a digital camera (QICAM) and
processed by Q-capture pro 5.1 (Q-Imaging Corporation). Cortactin and pY416-Src were
detected using AF-555 and AF-488 tagged secondary antibodies, respectively.
Cell growth, motility and gene expression analyses

Author Manuscript

In vitro growth, wound healing, Boyden (Transwell) migration, and soft-agar colony
formation assays were performed as described in our previous reports (11). Real-time PCR
analyses were performed with specific primers (Table S3) using JumpStart SYBR Green
Master Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) in a Stratagene Mx3005P real time PCR machine. Expression
differences of specific transcripts were quantified using the RPL32 or ACTB as the internal
controls by the ΔΔCT method. Western blot analyses were performed using the LI-COR
Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) and the intensities of bands
of interest were quantified using the software provided by the manufacturer and normalized
to internal control.
Tumorigenic assays

Author Manuscript

These experiments were performed as described earlier (47) under an IACUC approved
protocol. Cells (2×106 cells/mouse) expressing various combinations of GRIM-19 and v-Src
were inoculated into the flank of NCr nu/nu mice (n=10/group) and growth was measured
over a period of several weeks. To monitor the metastatic spread, these cells were
Lentivirally transduced to express fire-fly luciferase. Nude mice (n=6/group) were injected
on the lower left flank with cells (105/mouse) subcutaneously. Animals were monitored for
metastatic tumor spread using bioluminescence. Anaesthetized mice were imaged 5 min
after an intraperitoneal administration luciferin (3mg/mouse) using the IVIS-100 Imaging
System (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Mice were placed on a heated shelf to maintain body
temperature during the entire process. A seven-position filter wheel allowed imaging in
different spectral ranges to measure depth and distribution of the emitted light vis-à-vis
luciferase-expressing cells. Intensity of the emitted light is shown as a pseudocolor graphic
over the black and white image of the animal.
Statistical analyses
All data were subjected to Student’s t-test with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant.

SCC-derived GRIM-19 mutants cannot revert completely the v-Src-induced transformed
phenotype of 3Y1 cells. A) Immunofluorescent images of v-Src-expressing 3Y1 cell
derivatives showing Myc-tagged GRIM-19 (Green), actin network (Red) and nucleus
(Blue). Prominent stress fibers are seen in control 3Y1 cells (EV) while v-Src-expressing
cells totally lack them. In cells expressing v-Src alone, dense actin staining is observed in
podosome-like structures and stress fibers are completely absent. Wild-type GRIM-19
restores stress fibers while the mutants are unable to restore them like wild-type GRIM-19.
B) Differential effect of SCC-derived GRIM-19 mutant proteins on v-Src kinase activity in
