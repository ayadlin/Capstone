ABSTRACT
Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a key enzyme controlling neutral lipid metabolic
signaling in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs from LAL-deficient
(lal−/−) mice directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation. PPARf ligand treatment
inhibited lal−/− MDSCs stimulation of tumor cell growth and metastasis in vivo,
and tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro. In addition, PPARf ligand
treatment impaired lal−/− MDSCs transendothelial migration, and differentiation
from lineage-negative cells. The corrective effects of PPARf ligand on lal−/− MDSCs
functions were mediated by regulating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway, and subsequently blocking MDSCs ROS overproduction. Furthermore, in the
myeloid-specific dominant-negative PPARf (dnPPARf) overexpression bitransgenic
mouse model, tumor growth and metastasis were enhanced, and MDSCs from
these mice stimulated tumor cell proliferation and migration. MDSCs with dnPPARf
overexpression showed increased transendothelial migration, overactivation of the
mTOR pathway, and ROS overproduction. These results indicate that PPARf plays
a critical role in neutral lipid metabolic signaling controlled by LAL, which provides
a mechanistic basis for clinically targeting MDSCs to reduce the risk of cancer
proliferation, growth and metastasis.

[1, 4]. In addition to immune suppressive function,
our recent studies showed that LAL-deficient (lal−/−)
MDSCs possess direct tumor stimulatory function [5].
By Affymetrix GeneChip microarray, we have identified
that many important gene pathways are involved in the
dysfunctions of lal−/− MDSCs, notably among which,
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)regulated gene expression is significantly altered [6].
PPARγ, a member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily, serves as the receptor of free fatty acid
derived compounds which arise downstream of LAL
enzymatic action. After binding to these ligands,
PPARγ plays an important role in limiting inflammation
in various tissues by suppressing the expression of
inflammatory cytokines [7, 8]. Overexpression of
pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., apoptosis inhibitor
6 and matrix metalloproteinase 12) that are negatively

INTRODUCTION
Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes cholesteryl
esters and triglycerides in the lysosome of cells to generate
free fatty acids and cholesterol. Genetic ablation of the
lal gene in mice results in a systemic increase of myeloid
lineage cells, causing severe inflammation in multiple
organs [1, 2]. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
with co-expression of myeloid-cell lineage differentiation
antigen Gr-1 and CD11b in mice, are a heterogeneous
population of immature myeloid cells at different stages of
differentiation [3]. We previously reported that the neutral
lipid metabolic pathway controlled by LAL plays a critical
role in the development and homeostasis of MDSCs, and
demonstrated that LAL deficiency leads to the infiltration
and accumulation of MDSCs in various organs of the mice,
such as the lung, spleen, thymus, liver and small intestine

inactivation within lal−/− Ly6G+ MDSCs contributes to
their ability to stimulate tumor cells, freshly isolated
bone marrow-derived lal+/+ or lal−/− Ly6G+ cells were pretreated with 9-HODE or the vehicle, ethanol for 24 h.
In lal−/− mice, since almost all Ly6G+ cells are positive
for CD11b, a Ly6G-specific antibody was used for
purification of Ly6G+CD11b+ cells. To examine tumor
growth potential in vivo, pre-treated or untreated Ly6G+
cells were mixed with untreated B16 melanoma cells,
and then co-injected subcutaneously into lal+/+ mice. One
week after the injection, subcutaneous tumors detected
in the lal−/− Ly6G+ cell-injected mice were significantly
larger (tumor volume = 63.2 ± 11.7 mm3) than those
tumors in lal+/+ Ly6G+ cell-injected mice (tumor volume =
34.6 ± 11.9 mm3, p < 0.01). However, the tumors from
9-HODE-treated lal−/− Ly6G+ cell-injected mice (tumor
volume = 36.3 ± 12.4 mm3) were significantly smaller
when compared with those developed in ethanol-treated
lal−/− Ly6G+ cell-injected mice (tumor volume = 77.6 ±
16.4 mm3, p < 0.01) (Figure 1A). The similar effect of
9-HODE treatment on lal−/− ly6G+ cells to tumor size
was also observed at 14 and 21 days post-injection
(Figure 1A). Moreover, when B16 melanoma cells were
co-injected with C57BL/6 Ly6G+ cells into C57BL/6
mice, similar results were observed that the tumors from
9-HODE-treated lal−/− Ly6G+ cell-injected mice were
significantly smaller than those developed in ethanoltreated lal−/− Ly6G+ cell-injected mice at 7, 14 and 21
days post-injection (Figure   1B). As predicted, B16
melanoma tumor grew larger in C57BL/6 than that in
FVB/N mice at 14 and 21 days post-injection.
Next, the pre-treated Ly6G+ cells and B16 melanoma
cells were injected into the tail veins of lal+/+ recipient mice
to detect metastatic potential. Two weeks after injection,
less B16 melanoma colonies were observed in the lungs
of lal+/+ mice that received 9-HODE-treated lal−/− Ly6G+
and B16 cell co-injection than those received ethanoltreated lal−/− Ly6G+ and B16 cell co-injection (Figure 1C).
9-HODE treatment of lal+/+ ly6G+ cells did not affect B16
melanoma colonization in the lung (Figure 1C). Sections
of the lungs showed less neoplastic cells by H&E staining
and less Ki67 positive cells by IHC staining (Figure 1D).
These observations suggest that ligand-induced activation
of the PPARγ pathway in lal−/− Ly6G+ MDSCs impaired
the ability of these myeloid cells to stimulate tumor
growth and metastasis.

regulated by PPARγ has been reported to induce
chronic inflammation and spontaneous tumor formation
[9–13]. Our previous study has suggested that LAL
deficiency causes inactivation of PPARγ by blocking
ligand generation, which in turn promotes pulmonary
inflammation and pathogenesis [14]. Furthermore,
by using the dominant-negative PPARγ (dnPPARγ)
myeloid-specific overexpression bitransgenic mouse
model, we found that PPARγ plays a key role in
controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, MDSC
expansion, immunosuppression, and the development of
cancer [15].
Since LAL downstream metabolic derivatives
serve as hormonal ligands for PPARγ, the current study
examined if PPARγ plays an important role in LALmediated functions in MDSCs. Here, the corrective
effects of the PPARγ ligand 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic
acid (9-HODE) on the neutral lipid metabolic signaling
controlled by LAL are examined, including effects
on the development and function of MDSCs, MDSCs
transendothelial migration, tumor cell proliferation
and metastasis. The results demonstrate that 9-HODE
treatment corrected the defects in lal−/− MDSCs via
effecting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway and by inhibiting overproduction of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). These findings provide novel
mechanistic insights into the linkage between lipid
metabolic signaling and PPARγ in MDSC dysfunction.
Importantly, these studies reveal the critical role of LAL
and PPARγ in checking MDSC functions and the potential
as a therapeutic target to modulate tumor growth and
spread associated with MDSCs.

RESULTS
PPARγ ligand impaired lal−/− Ly6G+ cell
stimulation of tumor growth and metastasis
in vivo
PPARγ inactivation has previously been reported
to cause inflammation-triggered cell growth and
emphysema in lal−/− mice, and treatment with the
PPARγ ligand 9-HODE significantly rescued lal−/−
pulmonary inflammation and aberrant gene expression
[14]. lal−/− Ly6G+ MDSCs have recently been found to
play a role in stimulating tumor growth and metastasis
[5]. Based on the literature and our own experience,
the wild type bone marrow is comprised of ~50%
CD11b+Ly6G+ myeloid precursor cells (with very low
immunosuppressive function) and very few CD11b+
or Ly6G+ single cells. On the other hand, the lal−/−
bone marrow is comprised of 70% CD11b+Ly6G+ cells
(with very strong immunosuppression and cancer cell
stimulation potential). These lal−/− bone marrow cells
do not further differentiate into more mature myeloid
cells as wild type cells do [1]. To see whether PPARγ

As  shown in Figure 2A, 9-HODE treatment of lal−/−
Ly6G+ cells significantly decreased proliferation of B16
melanoma cells upon co-culture, compared with that of
ethanol-treated lal−/− Ly6G+ cells. When 9-HODE-treated
lal−/− Ly6G+ cells were co-cultured with Lewis lung cancer
(LLC) cells, reduced proliferation of LLC cells was also

observed (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results suggest
that activation of the PPARγ pathway in lal−/− Ly6G+ cells
impaired the capacity of these myeloid cells to stimulate
tumor cell proliferation.
Cytokines secreted by lal−/− Ly6G+ MDSCs have
been reported to be responsible for mediating their

significant increase in the span of the wounded area. These
results also suggest that activation of the PPARγ pathway
in lal−/− Ly6G+ cells impaired the stimulatory effects of
these MSDCs on B16 melanoma cell migration in vitro.

stimulatory effects on cancer cell proliferation [5]. To
examine whether 9-HODE treatment has an effect on
cytokine-mediated Ly6G+ MDSCs stimulation on cancer
cell proliferation, transwell studies were performed with
9-HODE pre-treated Ly6G+ cells seeded in the upper
chamber and melanoma cells seeded in the lower chamber.
After 72 h co-culture, the number of B16 melanoma cells
that were co-cultured with 9-HODE pre-treated lal−/−
Ly6G+ cells was significantly less (Figure 2C), suggesting
the ability of lal−/− Ly6G+ cells to promote melanoma cell
proliferation was impaired by PPARγ ligand treatment.
Because cell migration contributes to metastasis,
in vitro tumor cell migration assay was analyzed to
determine whether PPARγ ligand treatment of lal−/− Ly6G+
cells influences B16 melanoma cell migration. Melanoma
cells were treated with mitomycin C to eliminate the
potential effects of cell proliferation in these assays. As
shown in Figure 2D, 24 h after co-culture with lal−/− Ly6G+
cells, B16 melanoma cells migrated more efficiently into
the area of an artificial wound area compared with those
tumor cells co-cultured with lal+/+ Ly6G+ cells. However,
delayed migration towards the scratch was observed in

PPARγ ligand decreased lal−/− MDSC
transendothelial migration capability and
differentiation from lal−/− Lin- cells
Besides effects on tumor growth and metastasis,
lal−/− Ly6G+ MDSCs displayed increased transendothelial
migration capability [16], which likely results in the
severe infiltration of MDSCs in multiple organs of lal−/−
mice. To test whether PPARγ inactivation in lal−/− Ly6G+
cells plays a role in their increased transendothelial
migration, transwell assays were performed with 9-HODE
pre-treated CMFDA-labeled Ly6G+ cells seeded onto an
endothelial monolayer in the upper chamber of the plates.
Four hours later, the number of Ly6G+ cells that had
migrated through to the lower chamber was determined.
As shown in Figure 3A, there were less Ly6G+ cells in the

lower chamber when lal−/− Ly6G+ cells were treated with
9-HODE compared with these cells treated with ethanol,
suggesting that the PPARγ pathway is involved in Ly6G+
cell endothelial transmigration capability.
Abnormal expansion of MDSCs was also observed
in lal−/− mice, which was due to increased differentiation
from Lin- cells [1]. PPARγ is known to be expressed in
bone marrow progenitor cells and play a critical role in
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and adipogenesis
[17–19]. To test the role of PPARγ in this process, bone
marrow-derived Lin- cells from lal+/+ and lal−/− mice
were isolated and treated with 9-HODE or ethanol.
After 5 days of incubation, fewer Ly6G+CD11b+ cells
were derived from 9-HODE-treated lal−/− Lin- cells
compared with those with ethanol treatment (Figure 3B),
suggesting that activation of the PPARγ pathway by
9-HODE prevented these Lin- cells from differentiating
into MDSCs.

In addition, 9-HODE treatment suppressed the increased
ROS production in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ cells (Figure 5B).
These results suggest that ROS overproduction and
damaged mitochondrial membrane potential associated
with lal−/− MDSCs can be corrected by PPARγ ligand
treatment.

Overexpression of dnPPARγ in myeloid cells
facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo,
and tumor proliferation and migration in vitro
To further confirm the critical role of PPARγ in
myeloid-lineage cells, a doxycycline-inducible c-fmsrtTA/(tetO)7-CMV-dnPPARγ
bitransgenic
mouse
model was used, in which a dominant negative PPARγ
(dnPPARγ) was overexpressed in myeloid cells under the
control of the c-fms promoter [15]. As we published before
when the endogenous PPARγ signaling pathway was
inhibited by overexpression of dnPPARγ in myeloid cells,
the MDSCs level increased in bone marrow, spleen, blood
and lung [15]. Here we assess whether the disruption of
PPARγ function by expression of dnPPARγ in myeloid
cells has similar effect on tumor cell growth and metastasis
in vivo and tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro.
In tumor growth assessment, B16 melanoma cells were
subcutaneously injected into the flank region of the
bitransgenic mice. Figure 6A showed that the tumor
volume from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice was
significantly increased compared with those in untreated
mice at 4 weeks post-injection. For the tumor metastasis
potential, statistical analysis revealed that two weeks
after intravenous injection of B16 melanoma cells, the
doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice showed increased
number of melanoma colonies in the lungs compared with
untreated mice (Figure 6B). These results suggest that
PPARγ inactivation in myeloid cells contributed to the
increased tumor growth and metastasis.
When bone marrow Ly6G+ cells from doxycyclinetreated bitransgenic mice were co-cultured with B16
melanoma cells in vitro, increased proliferation of B16
melanoma cells was observed in comparison with those
cells from untreated bitransgenic mice (Figure  6C).
Similarly, proliferation of LLC was significantly
increased after co-cultured with bone marrow Ly6G+
cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice
(Figure 6D). Furthermore, the in vitro wound healing
assay showed accelerated migration towards the scratch
in B16 melanoma cells co-cultured with bone marrow
Ly6G+ cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic
mice 24 h after creating the scratch, with a significant
decrease of distance in the wounding area (Figure 6E).
In addition, the transendothelial migration capability of
Ly6G+ cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice
was obviously increased as shown in Figure 6F. Taken
together, these results indicate that PPARγ inactivation in
Ly6G+ cells facilitated their transendothelial migration,
and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation and migration.

PPARγ ligand down-regulated mTOR pathway
activation in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ cells
We have previously reported that the tumor-promoting
function of lal−/− MDSCs is mediated, at least in part,
through enhanced activation of the mTOR pathway [5], and
that the mTOR pathway is involved in the differentiation
of Lin- cells into Ly6G+CD11b+ cells [20]. To test whether
PPARγ has an effect on the mTOR pathway, bone marrow
cells from lal+/+ and lal−/− mice were treated with 9-HODE
or ethanol. After 2 h of incubation, the expression levels of
phosphorylated mTOR (pmTOR) and phosphorylated S6
(pS6) in gated Ly6G+CD11b+ cells were measured by flow
cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 4, the increased
levels of pmTOR and pS6 in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ cells were
not observed in cells following PPARγ ligand treatment.
These results suggest that ligand-induced activation of the
PPARγ pathway in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ cells by 9-HODE
downregulated mTOR pathway activation.

PPARγ ligand reversed damaged mitochondrial
membrane potential and suppressed ROS
production in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ cells
ROS is an important mediator for MDSCs functions,
and its increase is often associated with mitochondrial
damage. In lal−/− MDSCs, both damaged mitochondrial
function and ROS overproduction have been observed,
and inhibition of the mTOR pathway decreased the ROS
levels and abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential
in lal−/− MDSCs [6]. To see whether PPARγ ligand
treatment corrects these defects, bone marrow cells were
treated with 9-HODE or ethanol, and ROS levels and
mitochondrial membrane potentials were measured by
flow cytometry analysis. As demonstrated in Figure 5A,
the impaired mitochondrial membrane potential in lal−/−
Ly6G+ CD11b+ cells was partially recovered with 9-HODE
treatment compared with that in ethanol-treated cells.

Overexpression of dnPPARγ in myeloid cells
overactivated the mTOR pathway, increased
ROS production and impaired maintenance of
mitochondrial membrane potential

change of mTOR and S6 protein levels (Figure 7A). As
a consequence, the mitochondrial membrane potential in
doxycycline-treated Ly6G+CD11b+ cells was impaired
(Figure 7B). In addition, the ROS production in
doxycycline-treated Ly6G+CD11b+ cells was significantly
increased compared with untreated Ly6G+CD11b+ cells
(Figure 7C). These results support that the PPARγ pathway
regulates MDSCs functions by modulating mTOR, ROS
production and mitochondrial membrane potential.

To explore the potential mechanisms underlying
the dysfunctions of MDSCs from doxycycline-treated
dnPPARγ bitransgenic mice, changes in the mTOR
pathway were explored. As determined above using
PPARγ ligands, the pathogenic function of MDSCs could
be linked to mTOR activation in lal−/− MDSCs. Results
showed that the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and S6
in gated doxycycline-treated Ly6G+CD11b+ cells were
increased significantly compared with those of untreated
Ly6G+CD11b+ cells, with no statistically significant

in cancer cell lines is associated with the induction of
cell cycle arrest, the increased expression of mRNAs
and proteins required for terminal differentiation, as
well as changes in cell morphology that are consistent
with a differentiated phenotype [21]. Yet understanding
pathways by which PPARγ contributes to the spread
and progression of cancer in vivo, including its effects
on immune cells is less well understood. LAL is a key
enzyme which functions in the metabolism of neutral
lipids, and its role in inflammation has been widely
studied [1, 4, 20, 22]. Genetic ablation of the lal gene
in mice results in a systemic increases in MDSCs
and decreases in T cell populations, causing severe
inflammation and pathogenesis in multiple organs

[1,  23]. LAL deficiency causes inactivation of PPARγ
by blocking PPARγ ligand synthesis [14]. The PPARγ
signaling pathway has recently been reported to play
a key role in controlling MDSC expansion and T cell
proliferation [15] . Here, 9-HODE, a PPARγ ligand [24],
reversed the increased MDSC expansion (Figure 3B)
and decreased T cell numbers in lal−/− mice (data not
shown), suggesting that PPARγ signaling is critical in
regulating LAL-mediated metabolic pathways central to
immune suppression [15]. Interestingly and importantly,
our previous [5] and present studies have shown that
lal−/− MDSCs were able to also overcome potent immune
rejection and destruction of tumors in allogeneic mouse
models.

However, lal−/− MDSCs facilitated melanoma cells’
growth and metastasis in allogeneic lal+/+ mice [5]. In
our preliminary study, B16 melanoma cells’ metastasis
was delayed in lal−/− mice pre-treated with PPARγ ligand
9-HODE. In the present study, activation of the PPARγ
pathway in lal−/− MDSCs with its ligand 9-HODE not
only impaired their stimulatory effects on in vivo tumor

In addition to immunosuppression, we have shown
that lal−/− MDSCs have a second potent effect on tumors,
by directly stimulating tumor cell proliferation, growth
and metastasis [5]. B16 melanoma cells grew quickly
and metastasized massively in allogeneic lal−/− mice,
yet this effect was suppressed in allogeneic lal+/+ mice
where immune destruction of the tumor took place.

the LAL-PPARγ axis in MDSC dysfunctions. Kittler
et al recently found that PPARγ inhibits cancer cell
proliferation by a metabolic switch, including suppressing
pyruvate oxidation and reducing glutathione levels, which
results in a marked increase of ROS levels, leading to
rapid hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein
and cell-cycle rest [31]. Similarly, in a “lal−/− MDSCslike cell line”, we have observed an mTOR-controlled
metabolic switch towards increased glycolysis and ROS
levels 30. In the current study, with PPARγ ligand treatment
of lal−/− MDSCs we found these cells displayed reduced
ROS and were unable to effectively stimulate tumor cell
proliferation.
The role of the PPARγ pathway in MDSC functions
was further investigated using an established bitransgenic
mouse model, in which dnPPARγ was overexpressed
in myeloid-lineage cells, resulting in blockade of
endogenous PPARγ function [15]. In this mouse
model, the function of the receptor of PPARγ pathway
is impaired rather than the ligand expression which is
perturbed in lal−/− mouse model. When melanoma cells
were injected subcutaneously into these mice, larger
tumor developed in the mice with myeloid-specific
dnPPARγ overexpression induced by doxycycline than
non-induced bitransgenic mice (Figure 6A). In addition,
after intravenous injection of melanoma cells, more
melanoma developed in the lungs of mice with myeloidspecific dnPPARγ overexpression (Figure 6B). When
MDSCs from the mice with myeloid-specific dnPPARγ
overexpression were co-cultured with B16 melanoma
cells or LLC cells in vitro, cancer cell proliferation
was enhanced (Figure 6C and 6D). Moreover, these
MDSCs facilitated melanoma cell migration (Figure 6E),
possessed increased transmigration through the EC
monolayer (Figure 6F), over-activated the mTOR
pathway, and impaired mitochondrial function and ROS
overproduction (Figure 7), similar to the characteristics
observed in lal−/− MDSCs, which showed inactivation of
the PPARγ pathway.
In conclusion, the PPARγ pathway plays a critical
role in metabolic signaling controlled by LAL through
regulating the function of MDSCs. The PPARγ pathway
served as a novel target to modulate the emergence
of MDSCs to reduce the risk of cancer progression
and metastasis. It has been extensively reported that
PPARγ ligands have a direct inhibitory effect on tumor
cells [32–40]. But their effect in MDSCs of the tumor
microenviroment is poorly understood, and should be
given a special attention. Therefore, PPARγ may impact
cancer cell proliferation through both direct and indirect
mechanisms including effects on MSDCs. The study
outlined here indicates that enhancing PPARγ function
in MDSCs should prove to be a highly effective strategy

growth and metastasis (Figure 1), but also significantly
retarded the ability of these MSDCs to block in vitro
tumor cell proliferation and migration (Figure 2). We
have reported that cytokines, (especially TNFα) secreted
by lal−/− Ly6G+ cells are, at least in part, responsible for
mediating stimulatory effects on cancer cells [5]. In the
present study, 9-HODE inhibited the cytokine-mediated
stimulatory effects of lal−/− MDSCs on melanoma cell
proliferation (Figure 2C). Therefore, PPARγ inactivation
in lal−/− MDSCs represents a major mechanism
underlying the stimulatory effects of MSDCs on cancer
cell proliferation and metastasis.
One major manifestation during LAL deficiency
is systemic MDSCs expansion and dysfunction in
multiple organs of the mice [1, 2, 14, 22, 25], which
arises from dysregulated production of hematopoietic
myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow [1]. When
lal−/− Lin- cells were treated with 9-HODE to activate
the PPARγ pathway, reduced differentiation of Lin- cells
into Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs was observed (Figure 3B).
Kaipainen et al showed that PPARγ ligands inhibit primary
tumor growth and metastasis by targeting endothelial cells
to inhibit angiogenesis [26]. Abnormal accumulation of
MDSCs in the lungs of lal−/− mice has been linked to both
endothelial cells (ECs) and MDSCs [16]. Activation of the
PPARγ pathway in lal−/− MDSCs with 9-HODE decreased
the transendothelial migration of MDSCs through the
EC monolayer (Figure 3A). These results collectively
indicate that activation of the PPARγ pathway corrects
lal−/− MDSCs dysfunction and abnormal expansion during
LAL deficiency.
In addition to inhibition of the PPARγ pathway,
enhanced activation of the mTOR pathway was associated
with lal−/− MDSC dysfunction as detected by Affymetrix
GeneChip microarray and Ingenuity analyses [6]. Thus,
multiple pathways may contribute to regulate MSDCs
functions. Studies have shown that the mTOR pathway
regulates PPARγ activation during adipogenesis by
targeting the transactivation activity of PPARγ [27, 28].
Interaction between mTOR and PPARγ has been reported
before in hepatocytes [29]. Deficiency of PPARγ in
chondrocytes resulted in aberrant activation of mTOR
signaling pathway [30]. The present study shows that the
mTOR pathway in lal−/− MDSCs is regulated by PPARγ.
Incubation with 9-HODE not only significantly decreased
the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and S6, but also
reduced the overall levels of mTOR and S6 in lal−/−
MDSCs (Figure 4). ROS production has been reported to
be one mechanism underlying MDSCs functions [3]. In
our previous studies, ROS production was increased in
lal−/− MDSCs with impaired mitochondrial function, which
mediated the mTOR-regulated lal−/− MDSCs dysfunctions
[6, 20]. Activation of the PPARγ pathway in lal−/− bone
marrow cells with its ligand 9-HODE effectively
improved the mitochondrial function and blocked ROS
overproduction in lal−/− Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs (Figure 5),

in blocking tumor cell growth and spread even in cases
where tumors may not respond directly to PPARγ ligands.
Among collection of ligands to PPARγ, those more likely
to achieve this therapeutic outcome in MDSCs remain to
be tested.

The tumor growth and metastasis model have
been described recently [5]. MDSCs and B16 melanoma
cells were collected separately. A pilot study has
been performed to determine the best ratio between
MDSCs and B16 melanoma cells. To test the tumor
growth potential, 6 × 105 pre-treated MDSCs and
2  ×  105 B16 melanoma cells were mixed, centrifuged
and re-suspended in 100  μL PBS, and then injected
subcutaneously into the flank region of 3-month old
recipient lal+/+ mice. Tumor volume (length × width2
× π/6) was monitored every week for 4 weeks. To test
the metastasis potential, 2 × 106 pre-treated MDSCs and
5 × 105 B16 melanoma cells were mixed and incubated
at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. After the incubation,
cells were centrifuged, re-suspended, and injected
intravenously into 3-month old lal+/+ mice. Two weeks
after the injection, the mice were sacrificed and the lungs
were inflated with 4% paraformaldehyde for examination
of metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and cell lines
Wild-type (lal+/+) and lal−/− mice of the FVB/N
background were bred in house. c-fms-rtTA/(TetO)7CMV-dnPPARγ bitransgenic mice of the FVB/N
background is a previously generated bitransgenic mouse
model [15]. All scientific protocols involving the use of
animals have been approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Indiana University School
of Medicine and followed guidelines established by the
Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical
Association. Animals were housed under Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee-approved conditions in
a secured animal facility at Indiana University School of
Medicine.
The murine B16 melanoma cell line, Lewis lung
carcinoma (LLC) cell line, and murine endothelial cell
(SVEC) line (purchased from ATCC , Manassas, VA,
USA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA).

Histology and immunohistochemical staining
The harvested lungs were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for overnight. After
fixation and embedding in paraffin, tissue sections
were cut to 5 μm thick. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with
anti-Ki67 antibody were performed by the Histological
Core Facility, Department of Pathology and Laboratory
Medicine, Indiana University. Images were taken by
Olympus microscopy image system (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

PPARγ ligand treatment
For in vitro PPARγ ligand treatment, 9-HODE
(Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was added
into the culture medium of MDSCs to a final concentration
of 20 μmol/L for 24 or 48 h. For the study of the effect
of PPARγ ligand on the mTOR signaling pathway, bone
marrow cells were treated with 9-HODE (20 μmol/L)
for 2 h.

In vitro co-culture of MDSCs and B16
melanoma cells
Previous study has determined the best ratio
between MDSCs and B16 melanoma cells [5]. Ethanol
or 20 μmol/L 9-HODE pre-treated (for 24 h) MDSCs
(5 × 105) and B16 melanoma cells (5 × 103) were mixed,
and seeded into a well of 96-well plates in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. Seventy-two hours later,
unattached MDSCs were removed by washing with PBS,
and the number of attached B16 melanoma cells was
counted. Morphologically, MDSCs are much smaller than
B16 melanoma cells for exclusion.

Isolation of bone marrow-derived MDSCs
MDSCs were isolated as we previously described
[5, 6]. Unlike those being classified into monocytic
and granulocytic MDSCs, almost all lal−/− MDSCs
are Ly6G+Ly6C+, and almost all lal−/− MDSCs are
CD11b+Ly6G+ cells. Therefore, to simplify the lal−/−
MDSCs isolation procedure, Ly6G antibody-coupled
magnetic beads were used and sufficient to isolate lal−/−
MDSCs from the lal−/− bone marrow, and equivalent
control from the wild type bone marrow [1, 2]. Briefly,
bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias
of mice. Cells were first incubated with biotin-conjugated
anti-Ly6G antibody at 4°C for 15 min. After washed with
PBS, cells were incubated with anti-biotin microbeads at
4°C for another 15 min. Subsequently, cells were subjected
to magnetic bead sorting according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Miltenyi Biotec., Auburn, CA, USA).

In vitro migration assay
In vitro wound healing assay was performed to
analyze B16 melanoma cell migration as previously
described [16, 41]. Briefly, B16 melanoma cells
were  seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well into
a 24-well plate and incubated overnight to form a
confluent monolayer. Scratch was created by scraping
1540

ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential
measurement

the cell monolayer in a straight line with a p200 pipet
tip. After washing 3 times with DMEM, the medium was
changed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 5 μg/mL
mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and
MDSCs pre-treated with 9-HODE or ethanol for 24 h
were added onto B16 melanoma cell monolayer at a
density of 1 × 106 cells/well. Images were taken at 0 and
24 h after creating the scratch. Migration was estimated
by measuring the distances from one side of scratch to
the other side using Image Pro-Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).

The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and
mitochondrial membrane potential in MDSCs was
measured by flow cytometry as we previously described
[20]. Briefly, bone marrow cells were first treated with or
without 20 μmol/L 9-HODE or ethanol for 2 days. For
ROS level detection, cells were harvested, washed, and
stained with 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (2 μmol/L,
Invitrogen), allophycocyanin cy7-conjugated anti-Ly6G
Ab, and phycoerythrin cy7-conjugated anti-CD11b Ab
(eBioscience) at 37°C for 15 min. After PBS wash, the
ROS level in Ly6G+CD11b+ cells was analyzed using a
LSRII machine (BD Biosciences).
For mitochondrial membrane potential measurement,
cells were stained with the fluorescent dye JC-1 (2 μmol/L,
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), allophycocyanin
cy7-conjugated anti-Ly6G antibody, and phycoerythrin
cy7-conjugated anti-CD11b antibody (eBioscience) at
37°C for 15 min, and then analyzed for phycoerythrin
(JC-1 red) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (JC-1
green) fluorescent cells in Ly6G+CD11b+ cells by flow
cytometry. Cells treated with 50 μmol/L carbonyl cyanide
3-chlorophenylhydrazone for 5 min were served as a
fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive control.

Transwell assay
Transwell assay was used to determine MDSC
transendothelial migration [16]. SVECs were added to
the upper chamber of 24-well 8.0-μm-pore Transwell
plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA), and incubated at
37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h to form an EC monolayer. The
supernatant was then removed, and CellTrackerTM
Green 5-Chloromethylfluorescein Diacetate (CMFDA)
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA)-labeled MDSCs
(2 × 104 cells in 200 μL media) were added to the upper
well. After 4 h, transendothelial migration of MDSCs
was determined by counting their numbers in the lower
chamber under 5 random microscopic fields.
To observe the effect of MDSCs-secreted cytokines
on melanoma cell proliferation, transwell assay was
performed with 0.4-μm-pore 6.5-mm diameter Transwell
plates (Corning) to separate MDSCs and B16 melanoma
cells. One million pre-treated MDSCs in 200 μL media
were seeded into the upper chamber of the plates, while
2 × 104 melanoma cells in 500 μL media were placed in
the lower chamber. After 72 hours’ culture, the transwells
were removed, and the number of B16 melanoma cells in
the lower chamber was counted.

Flow cytometry analysis
Single cells from the bone marrow of 5-month-old
lal+/+ and lal−/− mice were prepared as previously described
[9]. After 20 μmol/L 9-HODE treatment for 2 h, cells were
harvested, and labeled with anti-Ly6G and CD11b cell
surface antibody (eBioscience) at 4°C for 15 min. Cells
were then fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/
Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mTOR
antibody, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-S6 antibody,
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-pS6 (Ser235/236)
antibody, and rabbit anti-pmTOR (Ser2448) antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4°C
overnight. For anti-pmTOR antibody staining, cells were
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
in the following day. Cells were washed and ready for flow
cytometry analysis. Mean fluorescence intensities of the
proteins in the gated Ly6G+CD11b+ area were analyzed.
For flow cytometry analysis, ≥ 10,000 cells were acquired
and scored using a LSRII machine (BD Biosciences). Data
were processed using the CellQuest software program (BD
Biosciences).

Isolation of bone marrow lineage-negative cells
Lineage-negative (Lin-) cells were isolated from
the bone marrow by removing blood lineage markerpositive cells with an immunomagnetic microbead
technique as we previously described [20]. Briefly,
bone marrow cells were first incubated with a cocktail
of biotin-conjugated antibodies against lineage specific
antigens: CD11b, GR-1, B220, TER-119, and CD3ε
(Mouse Lineage Panel Kit, BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA, USA) at 4°C for 15 min. After washed with PBS,
cells were then incubated with anti-biotin microbeads
at 4°C for another 15 min. Subsequently, cells were
subjected to magnetic bead sorting according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec.). The
resulting Lin- cells were cultured in RPMI1640 with
10% FBS. Five days later, Ly6G+CD11b+ cells derived
from Lin- cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
analysis.
