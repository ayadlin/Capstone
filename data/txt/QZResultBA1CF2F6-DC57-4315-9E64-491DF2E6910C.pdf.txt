ABSTRACT
Dasatinib (DAS), a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is highly effective
in treating chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. However, its clinical use is limited due to serious adverse
effects. DAS can disrupt endothelial barrier integrity and increase endothelial
permeability which may cause peripheral edema and pleural effusion. Albumin
nanoparticles (NPs) as a drug carrier may serve as a useful tool for cell-selective
drug delivery to reduce DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and maintain
endothelial barrier integrity. In this study, we reported that DAS-loaded NPs exhibited
potent anti-leukemia efficacy as DAS alone. Importantly, albumin NPs as a drug
carrier markedly reduced DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability by restraining
the inhibition of Lyn kinase signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Therefore, albumin
NPs could be a potential tool to improve anti-leukemia efficacy of DAS through its
cell-selective effects.

INTRODUCTION

We reported previously that the basal activity of Lyn,
a member of Src kinase family, is required to maintain
endothelial barrier integrity [10]. Inhibition of Lyn kinase
by DAS disrupts endothelial barrier integrity, resulting in
increased endothelial permeability [10].
Nanoparticles (NPs) as a drug delivery system
could enhance drug bioavailability, increase specificity,
improve tissue selectivity and prolong pharmacological
effect resulting in higher therapeutic efficacy [11–14].
Meanwhile, the adverse effects of drugs may be effectively
eliminated by employing NPs as a drug carrier. Albumin
NPs have become a promising carrier for drug delivery
due to their merits in bioavailability, biocompatibility and
biodegradability [15, 16]. It was reported that piceatannolloaded albumin NPs were able to prevent vascular
inflammation by targeting activated neutrophils adherent
to inflamed endothelium [17]. Albumin NPs loaded

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) are the most common types of leukemia with
increasing morbidity [1–3]. Dasatinib (DAS), a small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can effectively fight
against CML and ALL by inhibiting the activity of both Src
and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases in leukemia cells [4, 5].
However, DAS treatment has been reported to cause
serious hematologic and non-hematologic adverse effects
due to its interaction with non-disease-related processes
and cells, which often leads to a dose reduction or
treatment discontinuation in clinic [6]. Peripheral edema
and pleural effusion are the common non-hematologic
side effects occurred during DAS treatment, which is
likely caused by endothelial hyperpermeability [7–9].

Effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on
endothelial barrier function

with paclitaxel also exhibited an enhanced anti-tumor
efficacy [18]. It was reported that albumin NPs were not
internalized by the TNF-α-activated endothelium [17].
Avoiding direct interaction of DAS with Lyn
kinase in endothelial cells may be a useful approach to
prevent DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability.
In this study, we investigated the possibility that the
DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability could be
prevented by employing albumin NPs as a drug carrier.
Human leukemic K562 cells and human pulmonary artery
endothelial cells (HPAECs) were used to investigate antileukemia activity of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs, and their
adverse effects on endothelial barrier function. Moreover,
we investigated the effects DAS-loaded NPs on Lynmediated cell signaling in endothelial cells, including
Lyn phosphorylation, VE-cadherin localization, and focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) modulation.

To assess the effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs
on endothelial barrier function, basal TER, an assay
for endothelial barrier integrity, was measured at a
different time points in HPAECs. Under the treatment of
DAS, basal TER began to decrease from 0.5 h, reached
its lowest point at 0.8 h (Figure 4), indicating that
DAS-induced disruption of endothelial barrier integrity
caused the increase of endothelial permeability. However,
the treatment with DAS-loaded NPs had little effect on
basal TER when compared with that of DAS. Our results
indicate that albumin NPs as a drug carrier diminish
endothelial barrier disruption caused by DAS.

Effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on adherent
junctions in endothelial cells

RESULTS

The subcellular distribution of VE-cadherin, as
a molecular marker of vascular endothelial adherent
junctions, was examined in HPAECs monolayers to
visualize the effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on the
integrity of endothelial junctions. DAS caused the distinct
discontinuities in VE-cadherin distribution between
the cells and formation of numerous interendothelial
junctional gaps (White arrow) at 2 h, indicating the
DAS disrupted adherent junction integrity (Figure 5).
Interesting, DAS-loaded NPs had little effect on
VE-cadherin distribution. The number of interendothelial
junctional gaps was significantly decreased under the
treatment of DAS-loaded NPs when compared with that
of DAS-treated cells. The results further demonstrate that
albumin NPs as a drug carrier retain endothelial barrier
integrity.

Characterization of albumin NPs
The results of dynamic light scattering showed
that albumin NPs with and without DAS loading were
similar in size and polydispersity index (PDI).The average
diameter of DAS-loaded albumin NPs was 148.0 ± 0.5 nm,
and the PDI was 0.163 ± 0.016 (Figure 1A). The Zeta
Potential of DAS-loaded albumin NPs was −19.7 ± 1.4 mV
(Figure 1B). After preparing the albumin NPs, the loading
yield of DAS in albumin NPs was 10.4–15.1 wt%.

Effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on leukemia
cell viability
Our results showed that both DAS and DASloaded NPs significantly inhibited the viability of K562
cells compared to vehicle treated corresponding controls
(Figure 2A). Furthermore, there was no significant
difference in viability reduction between DAS and DASloaded NPs treated cells. These results indicate that DASloaded NPs possess the same anti-leukemia activity as DAS.
DAS is known to possess potent anti-leukemia
activity through its inhibition of Src family kinases
including Lyn [23–25]. To further assess the effects
of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on leukemia inhibition,
phosphorylation levels of Lyn kinase (Figure 2B and 2C)
and FAK (Figure 3) in K562 cells were evaluated 2 h after
the treatment. DAS and DAS-loaded NPs significantly
suppressed the phosphorylation of Lyn kinase, and the
phosphorylation of FAK at residues Tyr397, Tyr576/577
and Tyr925. There were no significant differences in the
phosphorylation levels of Lyn kinase and FAK in K562
cells between DAS and DAS-loaded NPs. These results
indicate that the synthesized DAS-loaded NPs are as
potent as DAS in leukemia inhibition.

Effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs on Lyn
signaling in endothelial cells
We then examined the effect of DAS and DASloaded NPs on Lyn kinase signaling in endothelial
cells. DAS treatment significantly decreased the
phosphorylation of Lyn kinase in HPAECs (Figure 6),
while the treatment with DAS-loaded NPs had little effects
on Lyn phosphorylation. These results indicated that DASinduced Lyn kinase inhibition was reduced by employing
albumin NPs as drug carrier.
We previously reported that Lyn kinase-mediated
regulation of FAK activity plays a pivotal role in
maintaining endothelial barrier function [10]. To confirm
the involvement of FAK in DAS-induced endothelial
hyperpermeability, FAK expression was evaluated
after the treatment with DAS and DAS-loaded NPs. In
our study, DAS treatment significantly decreased the
phosphorylation of FAK at residues Tyr576/577 and

have been reported to serve as a promising drug carrier for
treating inflammatory diseases and cancer [17, 18, 26, 27].
In this study, we successfully synthesized albumin NPs
loaded with DAS. Albumin NPs were prepared according
to a modified desolvation method, which could assure
DAS encapsulated in the NPs [19, 28]. DAS-loaded
NPs possessed potent anti-leukemic activity as DAS.
Importantly, albumin NPs as a drug carrier markedly
reduced DAS-induced endothelial hyperpermeability by
restraining the inhibition of Lyn-FAK signaling pathway.
In our study, the anti-leukemia activity of DAS and
DAS-loaded NPs was assessed in K562 leukemia cells.
Our results showed that DAS-loaded NPs possessed potent
anti-leukemia activity as DAS. The key of NPs as a drug
carrier lies in the successful uptake of drug-loaded NPs
by target cells. It was reported that albumin NPs made
from denatured albumin could be internalized by activated
neutrophils [17]. DAS-loaded NPs may be internalized by
K562 leukemia cells through FcγR [29]. DAS released
from albumin NPs can then bind to Src and BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinases and inhibit their autophosphorylation
along with their downstream targets leading to blockade of
the oncogenic activities of leukemia cells [30, 31]. Future
studies using animal models of leukemia are needed to
confirm our in vitro data. The in vivo studies could provide

Uptake of albumin NPs by leukemia cells and
endothelial cells
To address the cell-selective effects of DAS NPs,
we examined the uptake of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated
albumin NPs by K562 cells and HPAECs. Our results
showed that Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated albumin NPs
were efficiently internalized by K562 cells, while little
green fluorescence was observed in HPAECs, indicating
that albumin NPs failed to enter HPAECs (Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
Adverse effects of anti-cancer drugs often lead to a
dose reduction or discontinuation of treatments in clinical
settings. NPs as a drug delivery system have been reported
to serve as an effective approach to enhance the drug
efficacy and reduce adverse effects [13]. Albumin NPs

important information on therapeutic potential of DASloaded NPs.
We previously reported that inhibition of Lyn kinase
disrupts endothelial barrier integrity [10]. Lyn, unlike
other members of the Src kinase family including c-Src,
Fyn, and Yes, strengthens endothelial barrier integrity
through phosphorylation of FAK at residues Tyr576/577
and Tyr925. FAK, a well-known Src family kinase (SFK)
substrate, plays a critical role in maintaining endothelial
barrier function [32, 33]. Down-regulation of FAK was

reported to cause disruption of adherent junctions at
endothelial borders resulting in formation of intercellular
gaps [10], indicating that FAK plays an important role
in re-establishing adherent junctions in endothelial cells.
In addition, FAK is a major determinant of vascular
permeability by regulating focal adhesion formation and
turnover [34].
In this study, we demonstrated that DAS treatment
disrupts endothelial barrier integrity in HPAECs by
inhibiting Lyn-FAK signaling, which is characterized

by the formation of intercellular gaps between adjacent
endothelial cells and reduced TER. The phosphorylation
of endothelial Lyn and FAK was inhibited by DAS
in endothelial cells. FAK phosphorylation at residues
Tyr576/577 and Tyr925, not Tyr397, was also inhibited
by DAS, which is consistent with our previous report

on Lyn regulation of endothelial barrier function [10].
The subsequent vascular leakage due to endothelial
hyperpermeability could lead to edema formation.

be internalized by endothelial cells [17]. In our study,
Albumin NPs entered leukemia cells efficiently, but
exhibited little uptake by endothelial cells. The failed
endocytosis of DAS-loaded NPs by HPAECs may be
due to the lack of Fcγ receptors on endothelial cells [35].
Thus, the interaction of DAS with Lyn kinase in
endothelial cells was prevented when DAS was loaded in
albumin NPs. DAS-loaded NPs was not able to inhibit the
phosphorylation of endothelial Lyn and FAK and had little
effect on endothelial permeability. The adverse effects
of DAS on endothelial barrier integrity were effectively
eliminated by employing albumin NPs as a drug carrier.
The albumin nanoparticles are designed by us to deliver
DAS selectively to leukocytes with less toxicity to
endothelial cells. It was also reported previously by others
that piceatannol-loaded albumin NPs were able to inhibit
vascular inflammation by targeting activated neutrophils
adherent to endothelial cells [17]. The albumin NPs are
not designed to be more selective to leukemia cells than to
normal leukocytes yet. Hopefully, in the future we could
also develop albumin NPs to selectively target leukemia
cells and with less toxicity to normal leukocytes.
In summary, we have demonstrated that DAS-loaded
albumin NPs exhibited potent anti-leukemia activity as
DAS. The disruption of endothelial barrier integrity by
DAS was markedly reduced by employing albumin NPs as
drug carrier. DAS-loaded NPs may offer a new treatment
option for patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who
are unable to tolerate DAS-induced edema and other
fluid retention. Albumin NPs as a drug delivery system
could improve the anti-leukemia efficacy of DAS through
its cell-selective effects. DAS-loaded NPs are potential
therapy for leukemia with better safety profile and antileukemia efficacy. This study could help us improve
the formulation of drugs with similar adverse effects as
DAS. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential
application of DAS-loaded albumin NPs in clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Albumin NPs were prepared according to a modified
desolvation method [19]. Briefly, HSA was dissolved at
a concentration of 20 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium chloride
solution and the pH of the solution was titrated to 8.
The resulting solutions were filtered through a 0.22 µm
filtration unit (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
MA, USA). To make DAS-loaded albumin NPs, HSA
solution (1 ml) was incubated with 1 mg of DAS dissolved
in DMSO for 1 h. Then, HSA solution (1 ml) with or
without DAS co-incubation was transformed into NPs by
the continuous addition of 4 ml of the desolvating agent
methanol under stirring (550 rpm) at room temperature.
The methanol addition was performed by a tubing pump
(FH10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barrington, IL, USA)
with a defined rate of 1 ml/min. After the desolvation
process 24 µl of 8% glutaraldehyde in water were added
to induce particle crosslinking. The crosslinking process
was performed under stirring (200 rpm) of the suspension
over a time period of 24 h at room temperature. The
nanoparticle suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for
30 min at 4°C. The nanoparticle pellet was re-suspended
in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4).
The size and Zeta potential distribution of DASloaded albumin NPs were measured using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano ZS Instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd.,
Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). To evaluate the loading
efficiency of DAS in albumin NPs, the supernatant
(containing unbound DAS) after centrifugation of a
suspension of DAS-loaded albumin NPs was collected
and centrifuged using 10 kDa Microcon (EMD Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) to separate unbound
DAS (Molecular Weight: 488.01 Da) from free HSA
(Molecular Weight: 66478 Da) molecules. DAS molecules
in filtrate were quantified by measuring the absorbance at
282 nm. The loading yield of DAS in albumin NPs was
calculated with the following equation: loading yield
(%) = (drug used–unloaded drug)/drug used.

Materials

Cell culture

Human serum albumin (HSA, purity ≥ 99%) and
8% glutaraldehyde solution were purchased from Sigma–
Aldrich Company (St. Louis, MO, USA). DAS (Purity:
> 99%) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated FAK at
residues Tyr397, 576/577, and 925, phosphorylated Lyn
and total FAK, and a rabbit monoclonal antibody against
total Lyn were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA). A goat polyclonal antibody
against VE-Cadherin was obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Primary HPAECs were purchased from Lonza
Walkersville Inc. (Conshohocken, PA, USA). These cells
were cultured with endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2,
Lonza Walkersville Inc.) and supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human leukemic K562
cells (kindly provided by Dr. Ying Liang, University
of Kentucky) were cultured with Iscove’s Modified
Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM, Thermo Scientific, Logan,
UT, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin (1%)
and cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator with
5% CO2.

Growth inhibition assay

488 reactive dye and reacted for 1 h at room temperature.
After reaction, the Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated albumin
NPs were purified by three cycles of centrifugation
(14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C) and re-suspended in
phosphate-buffered saline. K562 cells were seeded onto
24-well culture plates, with approximately 2.5 × 105 cells
in 1 ml of medium. HPAECs were cultured onto 0.2%
gelatin-coated coverslips placed in 24-well culture plates.
K562 cells and HPAECs were cultured for 24 h, then
exposed to the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated albumin NPs
(40 µg) for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with
phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with –20°C 100%
methanol for 10 minutes. After fixation, the cells were
washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The
coverslips with HPAECs were put on the slides coated
with DAPI for nuclear staining. K562 cells were smeared
on the surface of the slides and stained with DAPI. The
uptake of albumin NPs by K562 cells and HPAECs was
visualized using an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive cell
proliferation Assay Kit (Promega Corp., Madison,
Wisconsin, USA) was used for growth inhibition assay as
previously described [20]. 10,000 K562 cells were plated
in 96-well flat-bottomed plates and cultured for 24 h.
Cells were exposed to DMSO, NPs, DAS (100 nM) or
DAS-loaded NPs (100 nM as DAS) in IMDM with 10%
FBS, for an additional 72 h. 20 μl MTS/PMS solution
was added into each well containing 100 μl of the culture
medium. Then, the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C
before measurement of absorbance at 490 nm with an
Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments
Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Absorbance values changes
were normalized to that for untreated cells.

Measurement of transendothelial electrical
resistance
Real-time changes in transendothelial electrical
resistance (TER) across endothelial monolayers were
measured to evaluate the endothelial barrier function as
previously described [21]. Briefly, HPAECs were seeded
onto gold microelectrode arrays (Applied Biophysics Inc.,
Troy, NY, USA) and cultured to confluence. Cells were
exposed to DMSO, NPs, DAS (100 nM) or DAS-loaded
NPs (100 nM as DAS). After exposure, impedance across
the cells was measured for 2.5 h, and the TER changes
were normalized to its initial value.

Immunoblotting assay
Approximately 4 × 105 HPAECs or K562 cells were
seeded into 6-well plates in serum-containing medium.
After culture for 24 h, cells were exposed to DMSO, NPs,
DAS (100 nM) or DAS-loaded NPs (100 nM as DAS)
for 2 h. The cells were lysed for protein extraction using
cell lysis buffer with protease inhibitor and phosphatase
inhibitor (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).
The total protein concentration was measured by BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL,
USA). Isolated proteins (30 μg/Lane) were separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membrane for immunoblotting assay as described
previously [22].

Immunofluorescence staining
To assess the effect of DAS and DAS-loaded NPs
on adherent junctions between endothelial cells, HPAECs
cultured onto 0.2% gelatin-coated coverslips were
incubated with DMSO, NPs, DAS (100 nM) or DASloaded NPs (100 nM as DAS) for 2 h. Cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, followed by
permeabilization with 0.1% Triton ×-100. Thereafter, cells
were incubated with primary antibody against endogenous
VE-cadherin for 1 h, followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 594 labeled donkey anti-goat secondary antibody,
using Hanks balanced salt solution containing 1%
bovine serum albumin as a blocking buffer. Images were
acquired using an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analyses
Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6
software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA). Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. A one-way
analysis of variance followed by Turkey’s test (multiple
groups) was performed to determine the statistical
significance (P < 0.05) between the indicated groups.
