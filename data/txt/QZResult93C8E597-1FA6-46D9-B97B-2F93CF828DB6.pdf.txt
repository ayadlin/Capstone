Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aurora kinase A (AURKA) localizes to centrosomes and mitotic spindles where it mediates
mitotic progression and chromosomal stability. Overexpression of AURKA is common in cancer,
resulting in acquisition of alternate non-mitotic functions. In the current study, we identified a
novel role for AURKA in regulating ovarian cancer cell dissemination and evaluated the efficacy
of an AURKA-selective small molecule inhibitor, alisertib (MLN8237), as a single agent and
combined with paclitaxel using an orthotopic xenograft model of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
Ovarian carcinoma cell lines were used to evaluate the effects of AURKA inhibition and
overexpression on migration and adhesion. Pharmacologic or RNAi-mediated inhibition of
AURKA significantly reduced ovarian carcinoma cell migration and adhesion and the activationassociated phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal regulatory protein SRC at tyrosine 416 (pSRCY416).
Conversely, enforced expression of AURKA resulted in increased migration, adhesion and
activation of SRC in cultured cells. In vivo tumor growth and dissemination were inhibited by
alisertib treatment as a single agent. Moreover, combination of alisertib with paclitaxel, an agent
commonly used in treatment of EOC, resulted in more potent inhibition of tumor growth and
dissemination compared to either drug alone. Taken together, these findings support a role for
AURKA in EOC dissemination by regulating migration and adhesion. They also point to the

Introduction
The majority of women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are diagnosed at advanced
stage when disease has spread beyond the ovary. Peritoneal dissemination and ascites are a
significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although most patients respond to
aggressive surgical debulking and platinum and taxane-based combination chemotherapy,
the majority experience disease recurrence and ultimately drug resistance, making EOC the
most lethal gynecologic malignancy (1). Hence, there is a critical need to identify additional
therapeutic agents that target pathways specific to EOC progression.

Aurora kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases consisting of three members,
AURKA, AURKB and AURKC, which are essential regulators of mitosis (2, 3). The
expression and activity of Aurora kinases are tightly regulated, with dysregulation leading to
genetic instability, aneuploidy and cell death (3). AURKA plays critical roles in mitotic
entry, centrosome function and bipolar spindle assembly. AURKA is implicated in the
regulation of the G2/M transition; inhibition of AURKA expression results in G2/M arrest
and apoptosis, while ectopic expression allows cells to bypass the G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint (2). Overexpression of AURKA is a common feature of EOC and other solid
tumors (3, 4) and can be related to gene amplification, transcriptional activation or delayed
protein degradation (5–11). High levels of AURKA in primary ovarian tumors is associated
with supernumerary centrosomes and overall decreased survival (12), suggesting that
AURKA plays an important role in ovarian cancer biology.
In addition to well-established roles of AURKA in cancer-associated genetic instability and
aneuploidy, recent studies implicate a potential role for AURKA in metastasis (13–17). High
levels of AURKA expression in clinical head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
specimens is associated with invasion, advanced stage and poor prognosis (14, 18). The
mechanisms by which AURKA influences cell migration and invasion are not completely
defined, although studies suggest roles for RAS (19), AKT (13, 20), MAPK (18) and RALA
(21).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prior work suggests the possibility that AURKA may exert its effects on motility through a
group of closely interacting proteins that regulate focal adhesion turnover and motility,
including NEDD9, SRC and FAK (22). NEDD9 is a scaffolding protein that has dual
functions at focal adhesions and at centrosomes during interphase and mitosis, respectively
(23, 24). It is critical for activation of SRC and FAK, and in regulating factors involved in
the cytoskeletal reorganization and focal adhesion turnover required for migration and cell
rounding during mitosis. Recent work showed NEDD9 is also an in vivo mediator of
metastasis in mouse models of melanoma and lung cancer (25, 26). Notably, association
with NEDD9 is required for AURKA activation, and overexpression of NEDD9 results in
supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar spindles, similar to effects observed with
AURKA overexpression (27).
AURKA has become a target of interest for therapeutic intervention because of its frequent
activation in human tumors. There are a number of available Aurora kinase inhibitors that

have dual-specificity for AURKA and AURKB, including MK-0457 and PHA-739358. In
vivo treatment with these agents results in phenotypes consistent with abrogation of AURKB
function (3, 28). More recently, AURKA-selective inhibitors have been developed. Among
these, MLN8054, an ATP-competitive, reversible inhibitor is >150-fold more selective for
AURKA than AURKB (29). In preclinical studies, MLN8054 inhibited human colon and
prostate xenograft growth, an effect that was sustained after drug withdrawal (29).
Consistent with inhibition of AURKA activity, analysis of primary tumors showed
accumulation of cells in mitotic arrest and undergoing apoptosis (29). A second-generation
compound, alisertib (MLN8237), exhibits even greater specificity for AURKA, with >200fold greater selectivity for AURKA than AURKB (30).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The current study tests the hypothesis that AURKA plays a role in EOC growth and
dissemination. The effects of AURKA loss- and gain-of-function were assessed in cultured
EOC cells and the effects of alisertib on the growth and dissemination of orthotopic ovarian
xenografts. We report that either pharmacologic or RNAi-mediated inhibition of AURKA
resulted in decreased migration and adhesion of EOC cells. In addition, inhibition of
AURKA expression or activity resulted in significantly reduced SRC activation, as
measured by phosphorylation at tyrosine 416 (pSRCY416). Conversely, enforced expression
of AURKA resulted in increased migration, adhesion and pSRCY416 levels. Alisertib
treatment alone or combined with paclitaxel significantly reduced the growth and
dissemination of orthotopic EOC xenografts. Collectively, these observations support the
hypothesis that AURKA plays an important role in EOC dissemination in vitro and in vivo
and further suggest the potential clinical utility of AURKA inhibition alone or in
conjunction with taxanes for the treatment of EOC.

Results
AURKA regulates migration in ovarian carcinoma cells
A panel of ten cell lines was screened for highly active AURKA using a pAURKAT288
ELISA (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The specificity of the assay was confirmed in control
experiments showing a sharp induction of pAURKAT288 levels in cells treated with
nocodazole or transiently transfected with an AURKA expression construct (Supplementary
Fig. S1B–C). Two cell lines with high levels of activated AURKA (OVCAR-5 and
SKOV3ip2) and two cell lines with low levels of activated AURKA (A2780 and OVCA433)
were selected for studies evaluating the effects of AURKA inhibition or overexpression.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if AURKA plays a role in EOC dissemination, in vitro experiments were
performed to evaluate the effects of AURKA loss- or gain-of-function on migration and
adhesion. First, alisertib sensitivity and dose-response were assayed by ELISA to measure
pAURKAT288 levels in cells exposed to increasing concentrations of drug (Supplemental
Figure S1D). Cell lines with high endogenous levels of activated AURKA (OVCAR-5 and
SKOV-3ip2) exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of pAURKAT288 levels at
alisertib concentrations of 10 nmol/L and higher (p<0.0001). A2780 and OVCA-433 cells
exhibit lower endogenous levels of pAURKAT288, and significant inhibition was observed at
concentrations of 25 nmol/L alisertib and higher (p<0.001). To ensure that the doses of
alisertib used in subsequent assays were not cytotoxic, cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of alisertib for 48–72 hr to evaluate the effects on proliferation and apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S2A–E). Alisertib doses (10–50 nmol/L) that showed little or no
significant effects on proliferation or apoptosis were used for subsequent assays. The effect
of inhibition of AURKA kinase activity on migration was assessed using trans-well
chemotactic migration assays. Alisertib inhibited OVCAR-5 cell migration in a
concentration-dependent manner, with a 19% and 40% and 60% (P < 0.01) decrease in
migration of cells treated with 10, 25, and 50 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1A). Similar results

were observed in SKOV3ip2 cells, where 10 25 and 50 nmol/L alisertib reduced migration
by 28%, 47% and 59% (P < 0.001, Fig. 1B). Alisertib treatment also inhibited migration in
cells with low endogenous AURKA activity; drug treatment (10, 25, and 50 nmol/L,
respectively) inhibited cell migration by 32%, 47% and 56% in A2780 cells and by 23 %,
31% and 45% in OVCA433 cells (P < 0.0001, Supplemental Figure S3). These results show
that alisertib treatment decreases the migratory capacity of EOC cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prior studies (24, 31) showed that AURKA functions are mediated through interactions with
NEDD9, a scaffolding protein that regulates SRC and FAK. Therefore, we investigated the
potential role of these proteins in AURKA-mediated migration by evaluating their
expression and activation in cells treated with increasing concentrations of alisertib.
Activation of each of these proteins depends on distinct phosphorylation events that can be
detected by a mobility shift in NEDD9 and phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in
SRC and FAK. Increasing doses of alisertib (10, 25, 50 nmol/L) resulted in a concentrationdependent decrease in phosphorylation of SRC at tyrosine 416 (pSRCY416) in OVCAR-5
and SKOV3ip2 cells (Fig. 1A–B) indicating decreased SRC activity. Alisertib had negligible
effects on the levels or mobility of NEDD9 or the levels of pFAKY861 in either cell line
(Fig. 1 and not shown). A slight increase in total AURKA levels was observed in alisertibtreated cells; though the reasons for this are unclear, AURKA activity measured by ELISA
clearly showed significant (P < 0.0001) concentration-dependent decreases in pAURKAT288
levels in response to alisertib (Supplemental Figure S1D).
Cell-free assays with 1 μM alisertib show inhibition of many kinases including SRC (30);
however, the doses of alisertib used in the current studies (10 – 50 nmol/L) are low and not
predicted result in off-target effects resulting in direct interference with SRC kinase activity.
To confirm the specificity of the effects of AURKA inhibition on migration and SRC
activation, we evaluated RNAi-mediated silencing of AURKA with two individual AURKAtargeting siRNAs and a non-targeting scrambled control siRNA (Figure 2). Efficient
knockdown of AURKA by both targeting siRNAs was confirmed by western blot analysis of
AURKA protein levels (Fig. 2A–B). In addition, transfection with AURKA-targeting
siRNAs, si-28 and si-29, decreased migration of OVCAR-5 cells by 35% to 42% (P < 0.01)
and SKOV3ip2 cells by 34% (P < 0.0001) compared to scrambled siRNA controls (Fig. 2A–
B). Consistent with alisertib treatment, knockdown of AURKA with either siRNA resulted in
decreased pSRCY416, but no changes in NEDD9 mobility or pFAKY861 levels (Fig. 2A–B
and data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate that inhibition of AURKA
activity or expression significantly inhibits cell migration and SRC activation in EOC cell
lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next tested whether transient expression of AURKA in cells with low endogenous
AURKA activity stimulated migration and SRC activation. Expression of AURKA increased
migration by 75% (P < 0.0001) in A2780 and 64% (P < 0.0001) in OVCA433 cells (Fig.
3A–B). Separate assays confirmed that increased migration was not due to increased cell
proliferation (not shown). Western blot analyses showed A2780 and OVCA433 cells
overexpressing AURKA exhibited increased levels of pSRCY416 (Fig. 3A–B). Taken
together, these results show that AURKA plays a critical role in EOC cell migration, and
that activation of SRC strongly correlates with AURKA expression and activation, and
hence may play a role in AURKA-mediated motility.
AURKA regulates adhesion in ovarian carcinoma cells
The ability of ovarian cancer cells to shed from the primary tumor and adhere at secondary
sites within the abdominal cavity is central to the process of EOC dissemination (32). We
showed that AURKA mediates tumor cell motility and the activity of SRC, a tyrosine kinase
that regulates both cell motility and adhesion (33). Therefore, we next assessed the effects of

increasing concentrations of alisertib on tumor cell adhesion on type I collagen or BSA
(negative control). Alisertib treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in
adhesion to type I collagen; relative to vehicle-treated cells, adhesion was decreased by 35%
and 46% (P < 0.0001) in OVCAR-5 cells in the presence of 25 and 50 nmol/L alisertib, and
by 55%, 58% and 62% (P < 0.0001) in SKOV3ip2 cells in the presence of 10, 25 and 50
nmol/L alisertib, respectively (Fig. 4A–B).
Similar to pharmacologic inhibition, siRNA knockdown of AURKA decreased adhesion by
36–41% in OVCAR-5 and 38–44% in SKOV3ip2 cells compared to controls (Figure 4C–D,
P < 0.001). In A2780 and OVCA433 cells, overexpression of AURKA increased adhesion by
3.3-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively (Fig. 4E–F, P < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
AURKA regulates EOC cell adhesion to type I collagen.
Alisertib sensitizes ovarian carcinoma cells to paclitaxel in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Data showing that AURKA mediates ovarian carcinoma cell growth and dissemination in
vitro suggest it may be a good therapeutic target for treatment of EOC. Interestingly, while
overexpression of AURKA has been shown to confer resistance to the effects of taxanes in
HeLa cells (34), pharmacologic inhibition or genetic depletion of AURKA sensitizes HeLa,
HNSCC, pancreatic, esophageal, lung and colon carcinoma cells to taxanes (35–39).
Taxanes are a component of standard front-line chemotherapy for EOC, and the
development of resistance to these agents is common (40). Therefore, we used the ChouTalalay method (41) to determine the molar ratio of alisertib and paclitaxel that results in a
synergistic combination index (CI) in limiting the growth of OVCAR-5 cells in vitro. In
these cells, the IC50 value for alisertib alone was 315 nmol/L, but when combined with
paclitaxel at a 16:1 molar ratio (alisertib:paclitaxel) the IC50 decreased to 35 nmol/L
(Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, the IC50 for paclitaxel was 4 nmol/L, but when
combined with alisertib at a 40:1 ratio, the IC50 decreased to 1.2 nmol/L (Supplementary
Table S1). These data demonstrate potent synergy between alisertib and paclitaxel in vitro,
and suggest that combination of these agents may be effective.
Alisertib treatment decreases ovarian tumor growth and dissemination in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An orthotopic mouse model was used to determine the therapeutic efficacy of alisertib alone
or in combination with paclitaxel in vivo. Briefly, mice (n=80) were given unilateral
injections of OVCAR-5-pWZL-Luc cells suspended in Matrigel into the intrabursal (i.b.)
space surrounding the left ovary. One week post-injection, the presence of tumor cells was
confirmed by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and the mice (n=16/group) were randomly
divided into five treatment groups: 1) vehicle, 2) 20 mg/kg alisertib, 3) 30 mg/kg alisertib, 4)
5 mg/kg paclitaxel and 5) 20 mg/kg alisertib + 5 mg/kg paclitaxel. Tumor growth was
monitored by weekly BLI (Fig. 5A) and the log-transformed total flux data showed
significantly decreased tumor growth rates in mice treated with alisertib (20 or 30 mg/kg
alisertib, P < 0.05) compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 5B). While BLI can be used as a
surrogate measure of in vivo tumor growth, this method is subject to limitations including
light absorption and scattering in tissues, limited spatial resolution (1–3 mm) and diminished
signal detection in deep tissues (42); therefore, endpoint analyses of tumor size and
dissemination are essential to determine differences in tumor growth in drug-treated
animals. In accord with the BLI data, analyses of the primary ovarian tumor volumes
showed significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in alisertib-treated mice compared to
controls (P < 0.001, Fig. 5C and D). Overall, treatment with 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg
alisertib resulted in 51% and 49% TGI, respectively. These results demonstrate that alisertib
exhibits significant single agent activity toward orthotopic human EOC xenografts.

To assess the effect of drug treatment on tumor dissemination, tumor nodules were
enumerated and 1) small nodules < 1mm diameter and 2) nodules ≥ 1mm diameter were
further quantified for volume (Supplementary Fig. S4A–C). Once-daily treatment with 20
mg/kg or 30 mg/kg alisertib resulted in a 26% or 50% reduction in the total number of tumor
nodules, respectively, (Fig.5F), and a 44% or 43% reduction in the mean volume of tumor
nodules, respectively, relative to vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Although
the trend did not reach statistical significance, these data suggest that once-daily dosing of
alisertib treatment reduced both the number and volume of secondary lesions.
An independent experiment was conducted to determine the effect of twice-daily (BID)
dosing with 30 mg/kg alisertib. In addition to highly significant 81% TGI (P < 0.0001), BID
dosing had a profound effect on the capacity for tumor to spread beyond the primary
injection site; the number of tumor nodules was reduced by 92% (P < 0.0001) in alisertibtreated mice compared with controls (Fig 5F–G). Taken together, these data show that
alisertib treatment significantly inhibits both ovarian tumor growth and dissemination.
Alisertib sensitizes ovarian carcinoma cells to paclitaxel in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In vivo TGI was also evaluated in mice treated with paclitaxel alone or in combination with
20 mg/kg alisertib. The TGI observed in paclitaxel-treated mice was similar (46%) to either
concentration of alisertib alone (Fig. 5D, P < 0.001). However, when paclitaxel was
combined with alisertib, the effect was significantly greater than either drug alone, with an
overall TGI of 63% (Fig. 5D, P < 0.0001 compared to vehicle and P < 0.05 compared to 30
mg/kg alisertib or 5 mg/kg paclitaxel). The total number of tumor nodules in the paclitaxel
and combination therapy groups was significantly lower than vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.05
and P < 0.001, respectively), and the number of nodules in the combination therapy group
was significantly less (P < 0.01) than in either of the alisertib monotherapy groups (Fig. 5E).
The number of measurable nodules and the mean volume were significantly decreased in the
paclitaxel and combination therapy groups (P ≤ 0.01, Supplementary Fig. S4B–C).
Collectively, these data show that alisertib is effective as a single agent, and the addition of
paclitaxel results in further reduction of primary tumor volume and secondary lesions.
Alisertib-mediated TGI correlates with decreased AURKA activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumors were subjected to IHC staining to evaluate the effects of drug treatment on levels of
pAURKAT288, pHisH3S10 and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table S2).
Consistent with the selectivity for AURKA, pAURKAT288 levels were lower in alisertiband combination therapy-treated mice (Fig. 6A). Levels of pAURKAT288 in tumors were
also quantified by ELISA, demonstrating a significant reduction (28%) in tumors isolated
from alisertib-treated mice compared to vehicle or paclitaxel-treated mice (Fig. 6B). Further
reduction in pAURKAT288 levels (65%) were observed in mice BID dosing of alisertib (Fig.
6C).
In contrast, tumors from drug- and vehicle-treated mice exhibited similar levels of
pHisH3S10 staining (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that AURKB activity was not
altered by drug treatment. No significant differences were observed in cleaved caspase-3
staining among any of the treatment groups (data not shown). These observations are
consistent with in vitro results showing that alisertib treatment did not dramatically affect
proliferation or apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). Densitometric analyses of immunoblots
showed a significant reduction in pSRCY416 levels in tumors from mice treated with 20 mg/
kg alisertib and paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S5A–B), but no differences in total SRC,
NEDD9 or AURKA were detected among any of the treatment groups (Supplementary Fig.
S5C and data not shown).

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Herein, we described a previously unappreciated role for AURKA in mediating ovarian
cancer cell dissemination, with findings strongly implicating an AURKA and SRC pathway
as an important signaling node in EOC progression. The mechanism of action for a number
of Aurora family kinase inhibitors has been investigated using xenograft models. In mice
harboring human EOC xenografts, treatment with the pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor MK-0457
resulted in TGI accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis (43).
However, the low levels of mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced by this and other Aurora
kinase family inhibitors does not fully account for the TGI observed (29, 43, 44). The
terminal phenotypes observed with pan-Aurora kinase inhibitors (e.g., MK-0457 and AMG
900) include decreased pHisH3S10 levels and accumulation of polyploid cells, suggesting
AURKB inhibition plays a significant role in anti-tumor effects mediated by these agents
(29, 43–45).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In contrast to pan-Aurora kinase inhibitors, AURKA-specific agents exhibit distinct effects.
Treatment of cultured cells or xenograft-bearing mice with AURKA-specific inhibitors (e.g.,
MK-5108 or MLN8054) resulted in increased levels of pHisH3S10 reflecting an
accumulation of mitotic cells in tumors due to increased AURKB activity (29, 37),
demonstrating the selectivity of these agents for AURKA. In MLN8054-treated mice with
colon or prostate xenografts, mitotic arrest and modest activation of caspase-3 induced by
AURKA inhibition was proposed to cause the observed TGI (29). In contrast, in our study,
although pAURKAT288 levels were significantly decreased in alisertib-treated mice, the
levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pHisH3S10 were not significantly different among alisertiband vehicle-treated mice. The reasons for these differences are unclear, but are unlikely
related to pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic differences between alisertib and MLN8054
as the half lives of these agents in vivo are similar (J. Ecsedy, personal communication).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The absence of significant effects of alisertib on proliferation of tumors in vivo suggests the
inhibitory effects of alisertib are not mediated entirely by mitotic inhibition (46) and that
other mechanisms may contribute to diminshed tumor growth and dissemination. Other
potential mechanisms may include induction of cellular senescence or anoikis. For example,
MLN8054 has been shown to confer changes associated with cellular senescence both in
vitro and in vivo (47). The significantly decreased levels of SRC activation observed in
conjunction with pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of AURKA are likely to directly
contribute to the observed loss of cellular attachment capacity and motility. Notably, we
previously showed that combination of the SRC family inhibitor dasatinib and Aurora
kinase inhibitors results in cellular attachment defects that contribute to the specific
elimination of cells undergoing dysregulated mitosis and polyploidy (48). The loss of
cellular motilty and adhesion may also prevent ovarian carcinoma cells from attaching at
secondary sites in the peritoneal cavity, a process critical to ovarian cancer dissemination
(49).
Consistent with observations in other cancer models (35–39), our data show that inhibition
of AURKA sensitized EOC cells to the effects of paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. These
results support the use of alisertib and paclitaxel for patients, and this combination therapy is
currently under evaluation in a Phase I/II clinical trial (http://clinicaltrials.gov). The finding
that AURKA inhibition in cultured cells and alisertib and paclitaxel treatment of EOC
xenografts results in decreased SRC activation suggests another potentially interesting
signaling node for dual therapeutic targeting. Previous work (48) demonstrated the capacity
for AURKA and SRC interaction and cross phosphorylation in vitro, and the combination of
Aurora kinase inhibitors with dasatinib potentiated EOC cell death. Hence, further studies
evaluating the combined inhibition of AURKA and SRC may be of clinical interest.

cells twice (24 h apart) with 50 nmol/L AURKA, or scrambled non-targeting siRNAs
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) using Lipofectamine 2000. The AURKA targeting
siRNAs used were the siRNA oligos (J-003545, Thermo Scientific) with the following
sequences: (si#28) - 5′-UUCUUAGACUGUAUGGUUA-3′, and si#29) - 5′AAUAGGAACACGUGCUCUA-3′. OVCAR-5 cells were transduced with a retroviral

inserts (8.0 µm pores) coated on the underside with type I collagen (10 µg/mL). Complete
media was placed in the bottom chamber, and plates were incubated for 20 h at 37°C in 5%
CO2. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Brightfield images (10× magnification) of five fields/insert were acquired with a CCD camera
coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Melville, NY) using Nikon Act-1C software;
migrated cells were counted, and the mean number of cells/field ± SEM calculated.
Adhesion was assayed by plating cells in OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies) in quadruplicate
on 96-well plates pre-coated with BSA (control) or 10 µg/mL type I collagen. Cells pretreated for 6 h with drug or vehicle were allowed to adhere for 30 min to 1 h. Wells were
washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Adhered cells were
counted in five fields (at 10× magnification), and the mean number of cells/field ± SEM
calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,

Orthotopic xenografts and in vivo bioluminescent imaging
All procedures involving mice were approved by the Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC)
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Seven to fourteen week-old female
C.B-17 SCID mice (FCCC Laboratory Animal Facility and Taconic, Cranbury, NJ) were
used for intrabursal (i.b.) injections as described (52). Mice were given unilateral i.b. (left
side) injections of OVCAR-5-pWZL-Luc cells (2 × 105) suspended in 5 µg/µl final
concentration of BD Matrigel™ Matrix High Concentration (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). Baseline BLI scans were acquired using the IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences,
Hopkinton, MA) as described (52) to confirm the presence of tumors. Alisertib (Millennium
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) was suspended in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-βcyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 1% sodium bicarbonate and 20 or 30 mg/
kg administered orally once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), using a 5 days on/2 days off
schedule. Paclitaxel (FCCC Pharmacy) was diluted in PBS and 5 mg/kg was administered
once weekly by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Mice were treated for two weeks and tumor
growth monitored by weekly BLI.

Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Regions of interest (ROIs) of identical size encompassing the luminescent signal were
assigned, and the sum of the total flux from dorsal and ventral images was calculated for
each mouse using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences). The mean total flux ±
SEM for each treatment group was subjected to log transformation to calculate the mean
growth rate for each treatment group. Statistical analyses were performed by subjecting pairs
of data sets to the Wilcoxon two-sample test; P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Phosphorylated AURKA ELISA assay

Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, necropsied and examined for gross abnormalities.
Reproductive tracts were removed and photographed and caliper measurements of tumor
length (l) and width (w) were made and tumor volume (l × w2 × 0.5) calculated. The total
number of tumor nodules were counted and classified as: 1) small nodules <1 mm diameter
and 2) ‘measurable nodules’ ≥1 mm diameter. The volume of small nodules was estimated
using the formula for a sphere, (4/3) × πr3, where the radius (r) was estimated at 0.5 mm,
and measurable nodule volume calculated as described for tumors. The volume of tumor
nodules for each animal was calculated by adding the volumes of the small and ‘measurable’
nodules. Portions of tumors were either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 10% (v/v)
neutral buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Tissue sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a pathologist (A.K.-S.). Tumor tissue microarrays
were made with duplicate cores of primary tumors (n=12/group) and used for
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with pAURKAT288 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories,
Montgomery, TX) as described (53). Images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse E800
microscope and CCD camera with the same exposure settings.

Levels of pAURKAT288 present in protein lysates of tumors were assayed using an
enhanced chemiluminescent ELISA (MesoScale Discovery™, Gaithersburg, MD) according
to manufacturers’ instructions.

Figure 4. AURKA regulates ovarian carcinoma cell adhesion

The effects of altering AURKA expression/activity on cell adhesion were assayed by plating
cells on 96-well plates coated with type I collagen or BSA (negative control). Adhesion was
quantified by counting five different fields of cells in quadruplicate wells. Treatment of
OVCAR-5 (A) and SKOV3ip2 (B) cells for 6 hr with increasing concentrations of alisertib
(10, 25, 50 nmol/L) decreased cell adhesion to type I collagen compare to vehicle (DMSO)
treated control cells. Silencing of AURKA by transient transfection of OVCAR-5 (C) and
SKOV3ip2 (D) cells with AURKA-specific siRNAs (si-28 and si-29) decreased cell adhesion
to type I collagen compared to cells transfected with scrambled (Scr) siRNA.

Overexpression of AURKA by transient expression of AURKA-RFP in A2780 (E) and
OVCA433 (F) cells resulted in increased adhesion compared to RFP vector control
transfected cells. For all cell lines, quantification of cell adhesion is depicted in the graphs
on the left as the mean number of adherent cells ± SE (n = 3 independent experiments). The
adhesion index (relative to control) is depicted in the graphs on the right as the mean relative
to control cells ± SE (n = 3). Bars labeled with asterisks are statistically significant as
analyzed by one-way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallace test followed by Dunn's multiple
comparison test and Mann-Whitney tests comparing individual columns (***P < 0.001 and
****P < 0.0001).

Figure 5. Alisertib alone or in combination with paclitaxel inhibits ovarian carcinoma growth
and dissemination

(A) Representative bioluminescent images of mice treated for two weeks with: vehicle
(veh), 20 mg/kg alisertib (ali), 30 mg/kg alisertib, 5 mg/kg paclitaxel (pac), and 20 mg/kg
alisertib + paclitaxel (20 ali + pac). (B) Average tumor growth rate as determined from
weekly BLI scans for each treatment group. One-sided Wilcoxon test showed the differences
in growth rates were statistically significant from vehicle control (*, P < 0.05 and ***, P <
0.001). (C) Gross images of reproductive tracts from representative mice from each
treatment group. (D) Vertical scatter plot depicting tumor volumes calculated from caliper
measurements of the primary ovarian tumor for mice in each treatment group where groups

Figure 6. Alisertib treatment inhibits AURKA activation in tumors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor samples from control and drug-treated mice were subjected to immunohistochemical
or electrochemiluminescent ELISA detection of pAURKAT288. A) Immunohistochemical
detection of pAURKAT288 in tumor sections. The same exposure time was used to capture
all images and the scale bar = 50 µm. B and C) ELISA detection of pAURKAT288 in total
tumor protein lysates showed significantly lower levels of AURKA activation in mice
treated with alisertib alone or in combination with paclitaxel compared to vehicle-treated
controls (**P < 0.01).
