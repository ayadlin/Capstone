Interleukin 6 downregulates p53 expression and activity by
stimulating ribosome biogenesis: a new pathway connecting
inﬂammation to cancer

Chronic inﬂammation is an established risk factor for the onset of cancer, and the inﬂammatory cytokine IL-6 has a role in
tumorigenesis by enhancing proliferation and hindering apoptosis. As factors stimulating proliferation also downregulate p53
expression by enhancing ribosome biogenesis, we hypothesized that IL-6 may cause similar changes in inﬂamed tissues, thus
activating a mechanism that favors neoplastic transformation. Here, we showed that IL-6 downregulated the expression and activity
of p53 in transformed and untransformed human cell lines. This was the consequence of IL-6-dependent stimulation of c-MYC
mRNA translation, which was responsible for the upregulation of rRNA transcription. The enhanced rRNA transcription stimulated
the MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53, by reducing the availability of ribosome proteins for MDM2 binding. The p53
downregulation induced the acquisition of cellular phenotypic changes characteristic of epithelial–mesenchymal transition, such as
a reduced level of E-cadherin expression, increased cell invasiveness and a decreased response to cytotoxic stresses. We found that
these changes also occurred in colon epithelial cells of patients with ulcerative colitis, a very representative example of chronic
inﬂammation at high risk for tumor development. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of colon biopsy samples
showed an upregulation of ribosome biogenesis, a reduced expression of p53, together with a focal reduction or absence of
E-cadherin expression in chronic colitis in comparison with normal mucosa samples. These changes disappeared after treatment
with anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Taken together, the present results highlight a new mechanism that may link chronic inﬂammation
to cancer, based on p53 downregulation, which is activated by the enhancement of rRNA transcription upon IL-6 exposure.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic inﬂammation is an established risk factor for the
development of many types of human cancers.1,2 The
inﬂammatory substances released in the inﬂamed tissue can
contribute to all steps of carcinogenesis by favoring both tumor
initiation, by inducing DNA damages involving oncogenes and/or
tumor suppressor genes, and tumor promotion, by increasing
proliferation and resistance to the apoptosis of mutated cells.3,4
Among the various substances present in the inﬂammatory milieu,
interleukin (IL)-6 has been proven to have a fundamental role in
experimental colon and liver tumorigenesis.5–8 Furthermore, the
high plasma level of IL-6 is a major risk factor for developing
human colorectal tumors9 and hepatocellular carcinomas.10 This
close link between IL-6 and cancer suggests that the IL-6 action in
enhancing cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis might not be
the only tumor-inducing mechanism controlled by the cytokine,
but that additional IL-6 effects that may be conducive to
tumorigenesis should be postulated. We recently demonstrated
that the upregulation of rRNA transcription by factors stimulating
proliferation downregulates p53 expression and activity by
enhancing the MDM2-mediated p53 proteasomal digestion.11
We hypothesized that in human pathological conditions in which
cell proliferation stimulating factors are produced, such as those
1

characterizing the chronic inﬂammation processes, a similar
mechanism may be active, thus contributing to neoplastic
transformation. Therefore, in the present study we ﬁrst
wondered whether IL-6 might stimulate rRNA transcription and
downregulate p53 expression and activity in human transformed
and untransformed cell lines. We found that IL-6 enhanced rRNA
transcription and that the upregulated rRNA synthesis reduced
p53 expression and function through the activation of the
ribonucleoprotein-MDM2 degradation pathway of p53.12,13
Moreover, we observed that the p53 downregulation was
responsible for the acquisition by the IL-6-exposed cells of the
phenotype and functional changes characteristic of epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT). Considering that the onset of colon
cancer in patients with inﬂammatory bowel diseases is a very
representative example of chronic inﬂammation-related tumorigenesis,14 we investigated whether the changes induced by IL-6
in the human cell lines were also present in the epithelial cells of
human colonic mucosa with chronic ulcerative disease. We
actually found that a marked nucleolar hypertrophy—a morphological sign of upregulated rRNA transcription15—was present in
the epithelial cells of all cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) examined,
together with a reduction in the p53 immunostaining. Moreover,
the major EMT phenotypic change, the reduction of E-cadherin
expression, also focally occurred in the epithelial cells of the colon

RESULTS
IL-6 stimulates rRNA transcription
We analyzed the effect of IL-6 on ribosome biogenesis in the
following four human epithelial cell lines: one from normal colon

epithelium (NCM460 cell line), one from colon carcinoma (LS174T
cell line), one from hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cell line) and
one from pancreas carcinoma (SW1990 cell line). The changes in
rRNA transcriptional activity in these four cell lines exposed to IL-6
were ascertained using real-time–PCR analysis of the 45S prerRNA
expression (Figure 1a). The rRNA synthesis was also evaluated by
the immunoﬂuorescence detection of nucleolar 5-ﬂuorouridine (5FU) incorporation into nascent rRNA in NCM460 and HepG2 cell
lines (Figure 1b). Both methodological approaches revealed that

IL-6 greatly enhanced rRNA transcription. As these data indicate
that IL-6 enhances c-myc expression16,17 in order to study the
mechanism involved in the IL-6 stimulation of rRNA transcription,
we investigated whether IL-6 enhanced the expression of
c-myc protein also in the human epithelial cells used in the
present study. For this reason we exposed both the NCM460 and
the HepG2 cell lines to IL-6. We found that IL-6 signiﬁcantly
increased c-myc protein expression as early as 1 h after IL-6
stimulation in both cell lines, as evaluated by western blot
analysis (Figure 1c). Unlike c-myc protein expression, the level
of c-MYC mRNA did not change for up to 3 h after IL-6 exposure
(Figure 1d). This suggested that, in our experimental conditions,
a post-transcriptional mechanism was activated by IL-6 and
was responsible for the increase in the c-myc protein. IL-6 has
been reported to control the c-myc protein level either by
increasing STAT3-mediated mRNA c-MYC transcription16 or via a
stimulatory effect on the c-MYC internal ribosome entry site.17
Therefore, we analyzed the effect of IL-6 exposure on c-MYC
mRNA IRES-dependent translation. For this purpose, NCM460
and HepG2 cells were transfected with a bicistronic in vitro
transcribed mRNA in which the c-MYC-IRES sequence was inserted
between two reporter luciferase cistrons (Renilla and Fireﬂy,
Promega, Milan, Italy). Evaluation of the ratio between the Fireﬂy
and Renilla activities indicated the IRES-dependent translation
rate. We found that IL-6 treatment strongly stimulated the
translation initiation mediated by the c-MYC-IRES in NCM460
and HepG2 cells (Figure 1e). As a control, a similar bicistronic
transcript not containing the c-MYC-IRES element was transfected
in IL-6-treated and control cells. In this case, no differences in the
ratio between the Fireﬂy and Renilla activities were detected.
These ﬁndings indicated that the increased expression of c-myc
protein observed in both cell lines after IL-6 exposure was due to
an enhanced c-MYC mRNA IRES-dependent translation. In order to
exclude that other post-transcriptional mechanisms may be
involved, such as changes in protein stability, we evaluated the
c-myc protein half-life in IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells after protein
synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide at a dose capable of
completely inhibiting protein synthesis. We found that the halflife of c-myc protein was unchanged after IL-6 treatment
(Figure 1f).
At this point, we wondered whether the stimulation of rRNA
transcription was exclusively due to the IL-6-induced upregulation
of c-myc protein expression. For this purpose, we downregulated
the expression of the c-MYC mRNA by the small interference RNA
procedure and evaluated the effect of IL-6 stimulation on the
synthesis of rRNA in HepG2 cells. We found that a c-MYC RNA
interference signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of the c-MYC
mRNA and c-myc protein and counteracted the stimulatory effect
of IL-6 on rRNA synthesis (Figure 1g).

IL-6 downregulates p53 expression and activity
The inhibition of rRNA transcription allows a larger amount of
ribosomal proteins, no longer used for ribosome building, to bind
to MDM2, thus reducing the MDM2-mediated proteasomal
degradation of p53 with consequent p53 stabilization.12,13
Conversely, the upregulation of rRNA synthesis reduces the
availability of ribosomal proteins for the binding to MDM2, thus
increasing the MDM2-mediated proteasomal p53 digestion.11
Therefore, we wondered whether IL-6 would lower p53 expression
and activity through the above-described mechanism. In fact,
even though it has been reported that IL-6 activates STAT318 and
that activated STAT3 binds to the TP53 gene promoter repressing
the transcription of TP53 mRNA,19 we found that no signiﬁcant
change occurred in the transcription level of TP53 mRNA in the
NCM460, HepG2, SW1990 and LS174T cell lines (Figure 2a). As
western blot analysis demonstrated that IL-6 treatment actually
reduced the amount of p53 in the NCM460, HepG2, SW1990 and
LS174T cell lines (Figure 2b), we considered the possibility that in
IL-6-stimulated cells the reduced availability of ribosomal proteins
for MDM2 binding might be responsible for an increased p53
proteasomal degradation. For this reason, we evaluated the halflife of p53 by time-course western blot analysis in control and IL-6stimulated HepG2 cells after treatment with cycloheximide. We
found that the half-life of p53 in IL-6-stimulated cells was shorter
than that of control cells (Figure 2c). Also, we treated IL-6-exposed
HepG2 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. We found that
the inhibition of proteasomal degradation canceled the difference
between the p53 expression of control and stimulated cells
without reducing the stimulation of rRNA transcription by IL-6
(Figure 2d). These data indicated that the downregulation of p53
expression was actually due to an increased protein degradation.
The increased p53 degradation appeared to be the consequence
of a reduced ribosomal protein binding to MDM2, which allowed
MDM2 to bind a greater amount of p53 for digestion. In fact,
coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the quantity of
L11 ribosomal protein coimmunoprecipitated with MDM2 was
reduced in IL-6-stimulated cells as compared with control cells,
whereas the amount of p53 was increased (Figure 2e). In order to
deﬁne the role of MDM2 in the reduction of p53 stabilization after
IL-6 treatment, we evaluated the effect of the MDM2 inhibitor
Nutlin-3 on p53 expression in control and IL-6-stimulated HepG2
cells. Nutlin-3 binds MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket, thus
hindering the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, which results
in p53 stabilization and activation.20 Western blot analysis showed
that Nutlin-3 induced a p53 stabilization that was quite similar in
control and IL-6-stimulated cells (Figure 2f). This strongly
suggested that the reduction of p53 expression after exposure
to IL-6 was actually the consequence of an increased binding of

MDM2 to p53. To exclude the possibility that IL-6 might mediate
the effect on p53 independent of a reduction in ribosomal protein
availability for MDM2 binding, we downregulated the expression
of RPL11 by the small-interfering RNA procedure and evaluated
the effect of IL-6 stimulation on p53 expression in HepG2 cells. We
found that the reduction of RPL11 mRNA and RPL11 protein
expression (Supplementary Figure 1) caused a strong reduction of
p53 expression and that IL-6 treatment no longer reduced the
expression of p53 in RPL11-silenced HepG2 cells (Figure 2g). This
observation conﬁrmed the importance of the reduction of
ribosomal protein availability for MDM2 binding, in particular of
RPL11, in the IL-6-induced p53 downregulation.
All together, these results strongly suggested that the reduction
of p53 expression after IL-6 treatment was the consequence of the
interleukin-induced increased translation of c-myc protein, which
in turn, by enhancing rRNA transcription, reduced the inactivation
of MDM2 by RPL11, thus favoring p53 protein digestion. In order
to demonstrate that this was the case, we also evaluated the effect
of IL-6 exposure on p53 expression in c-MYC-silenced HepG2 cells:
we found that c-MYC RNA interference induced a signiﬁcant p53
stabilization that was not quantitatively changed after IL-6
stimulation. In addition, depletion of RPL11 mRNA in c-MYCsilenced cells resulted in a strong reduction of p53 protein
expression that, once again, was quite similar after IL-6 exposure
(Figure 2g).
We also investigated whether the activity of p53 was reduced
after IL-6 exposure. We measured the expression of two p53 target
genes whose products have a tumor suppressor function: BAX
and PUMA.21 The expression of p21waf1/cip1 was not evaluated
because IL-6 exposure per se enhances p21 expression.22 The
quantitative analysis of the mRNA expression of these two genes
indicated that BAX and PUMA mRNAs were signiﬁcantly reduced in
NCM460 and HepG2 cells treated with IL-6 (Figure 2h). At this
point, we wondered whether the reduced p53 level in cells with
increased rRNA synthesis might also be reﬂected in a reduced p53
stabilization and activity after cytotoxic stress. For this purpose we
used NCM460 and HepG2 cells exposed to IL-6 and treated with
either Hydroxyurea or 5-FU for 4 h. Both drugs were responsible
for p53 stabilization in NCM460 and HepG2 cells, and IL-6
stimulation caused a reduction in the level of stabilized p53 in
NCM460 and HepG2 cells treated with hydroxyurea and 5-FU in
comparison with unstimulated, drug-treated cells (Figure 2i) (see
densitometric analysis in Supplementary Figure 2). In the case of
5-FU treatment, a longer exposure to the drug (12 h) caused a
strong stabilization of p53 also in IL-6-stimulated cells. However,
after 5-FU, the p53 amount in IL-6-treated cells was always lower
in comparison with that in unstimulated cells. This may be
because 5-FU did not alter rRNA transcription, which even after
12 h of drug exposure was higher in IL-6-stimulated than in
control cells (see Supplementary Figure 3 and relative discussion ).
Regarding the expression of the p53 target genes, we observed
that the BAX and PUMA mRNA level was markedly lower in IL-6stimulated than in unstimulated NCM460 and HepG2 cells after
either hydroxyurea or 5-FU treatment (Supplementary Figure 4).
Therefore, these results indicated that IL-6 induced a lowering of
the p53 level, which was responsible for the downregulation of
the p53 target gene response, also after exposure to cytotoxic
stresses.
IL-6 induces EMT by downregulating p53 expression
Downregulation of E-cadherin expression occurs very frequently
during the progression of malignant epithelial tumors,23 and the
loss of E-cadherin expression is responsible for the loss of
intercellular adhesion during invasion.24 The E-cadherin
expression is repressed by the transcription factor SLUG,
responsible for EMT.25 As p53 controls the MDM2-mediated
degradation of SLUG, 26 we wondered whether IL-6 could induce a
Oncogene (2014) 4396 – 4406

reduction of E-cadherin expression by increasing the level of SLUG
in a p53-dependent manner. For this purpose, we analyzed
E-cadherin and SLUG protein expression: we found that at 24 h
IL-6 stimulation increased the level of SLUG and reduced the
expression of E-cadherin in NCM460 and HepG2 cell lines
(Figure 3a). We did not observe any signiﬁcant variation in the
expression of E-cadherin and SLUG in TP53-silenced NCM460 cells
(see the efﬁcacy of TP53 silencing in Supplementary Figure 5).On
the other hand, to avoid any misinterpretation on the role of p53
in reducing the level of E-cadherin in IL-6-treated cells, we used
the HCT116 p53  /  cell line and analyzed the level of both
E-cadherin and SLUG after IL-6 treatment. As shown in Figure 3a,
IL-6 treatment did not modify the amount of both these proteins
in HCT116 p53  /  cells, thus indicating the crucial role of p53 in
this mechanism.
Also, the immunoﬂuorescence visualization of SLUG and
E-cadherin in NCM460 cells showed that IL-6 treatment increased
SLUG expression, whereas it greatly reduced the E-cadherinrelated signal (Figure 3b). All these data indicate that, in NCM460
and HepG2 cell lines, IL-6 induces phenotypic changes that are
typical of EMT.27 We also investigated whether IL-6 might increase
the cell invasiveness potential, and whether this was p53
dependent. For this purpose, we used control and TP53-silenced
NCM460 and HepG2 cells (see the efﬁcacy of TP53 silencing in
Supplementary Figure 5). We seeded the cells in an invasion
chamber and evaluated the effect of IL-6 treatment on their
migration through the matrix for 24 h. We found that IL-6
enhanced the invasiveness of control cells without affecting that
of TP53-silenced cells (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure 6).
Interestingly, the higher invasiveness observed in TP53-silenced
cells in comparison with IL-6-stimulated cells was found to be
associated with a lower level of E-cadherin expression in these
cells (Supplementary Figure 7).
In order to rule out the possibility that IL-6 might activate other
pathways leading to EMT, independent of rRNA synthesis
stimulation, we investigated whether IL-6 was capable of inducing
EMT in cells in which the interleukin could not enhance rRNA
transcription. To avoid IL-6 stimulation of rRNA synthesis, we
silenced the POLR1A gene coding for the RNA polymerase I
catalytic subunit by the small-interfering RNA procedure in
NCM460 and HepG2 cells (Supplementary Figure 8). This
procedure induced rRNA synthesis inhibition without reducing
protein synthesis11 and did not modify TP53 mRNA transcription
(Supplementary Figure 9). The reduction of POLR1A mRNA
expression was accompanied by a strong inhibition of rRNA
synthesis and by the stabilization of p53. IL-6 treatment neither
increased the synthesis of rRNA nor reduced the expression of p53
in POLR1A-silenced cells (Figure 3d). We then looked for changes
in the E-cadherin expression in POLR1A-silenced HepG2 cells after
IL-6 exposure: we observed no reduction in the expression of
E-cadherin in comparison with unstimulated cells in POLR1Asilenced HepG2 cells (Figure 3e).
Furthermore, the invasion assay showed that IL-6 treatment did
not increase the invasiveness of POLR1A-silenced cells (Figure 3f
and Supplementary Figure 10). These results led us to conclude
that the enhancement of rRNA synthesis was necessary for IL-6 to
induce cells to undergo p53-mediated activation of the EMT
program, whereas no other pathways that downregulate p53
expression and induce invasive neoplastic phenotypes were
activated.
Changes in ribosome biogenesis, p53 and E-cadherin expression
in the human epithelial cells of the colon with UC
The data obtained from experiments conducted using human
epithelial cell lines indicated that the enhancement of rRNA
synthesis by IL-6 exposure caused a downregulation of p53
expression with the consequent activation of the EMT program.

We wondered whether similar changes occurred in the epithelial
colon cells of patients with UC. We carried out this study on
histological sections from tissue samples prepared for diagnostic
purposes. In fact, for ethical reasons, we did not have the
possibility of using fresh tissue samples. The results reported
below are common to all the control and UC colon samples.
In order to evaluate whether an upregulation of rRNA
transcriptional activity occurred in the epithelial cells of colonic
mucosa from patients with UC, we measured the nucleolar size of
these cells in histological sections selectively stained by silver for
the argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) proteins. This
technique makes it possible to precisely evaluate the nucleolar
size.28 As the nucleolar size is closely and directly related to rRNA
transcription activity,15 we were able to obtain information on
whether UC resulted in changes in the ribosome biogenesis rate.
After silver staining, the histological characteristics of the normal
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

colonic mucosa are perfectly recognized (Figure 4a). Colonic
mucosa with UC appears to be characterized by a diffuse, mainly
mononuclear inﬂammatory inﬁltrate in the lamina propria
(Figure 4b). At a higher magniﬁcation, it is possible to observe
that the epithelial cells of normal crypts exhibit small nucleoli
(Figure 4c), whereas in crypt cells of UC they exhibited much
larger nucleoli (Figure 4d). Morphometric analysis and statistical
evaluation on normal and UC samples conﬁrmed that in inﬂamed
mucosa the size of crypt cell nucleoli was much larger than that of
normal cell nucleoli. Hypertrophic nucleoli also characterized the
surface epithelial cells of UC mucosa when compared with those
of normal mucosa (Figures 4e and f). After treatment with antiinﬂammatory drugs, the nucleolar size was reduced to the values
of the epithelium of normal, control colonic mucosa (Figure 4g).
We then evaluated the expression of p53 in histological sections
from control and inﬂamed colon mucosa biopsy samples. We

found that in normal colon mucosa the labeling was present
mainly in the epithelial cells of the deeper portion of the crypts
(Figures 5a and b). The labeling index of epithelial cells within the
crypts was 24.5 (±6.8 s.d.). Also, in the colon mucosa of patients
with UC, labeled cells were mainly located in the deeper portion of
the crypts (Figures 5c and d). However, the percentage of labeled
cells was lower (labeling index ¼ 9.8±4.5 s.d.), thus indicating a
downregulation of p53 expression in UC epithelial cells (Po0.01).
These data are consistent with the recent observation reported by
Risques et al.29 that p53 expression in human normal colon
epithelial cells was higher, even though in a nonstatistically
signiﬁcant manner, than that of patients with UC in whom
cancerous lesions had developed. After treatment with antiinﬂammatory drugs, the percentage of labeled cells was found to
be quite similar to that of normal, control colonic mucosa
(27.2±7.9 s.d.) (Figures 5e and f). These changes were associated
with quantitative variation of IL-6 expression in the inﬂammatory
inﬁltrate. As shown in Supplementary Figure 11, the number of
inﬂammatory cells immunostained for IL-6 was low in normal
colon mucosa; it was increased in UC, and reverted to the normal
colon value after treatment with anti-inﬂammatory drugs.
We then visualized and analyzed the expression of E-cadherin in
histological sections using the immunoperoxidase and immunoﬂuorescence techniques. The analysis of E-cadherin expression
using the immunoperoxidase technique indicated that the control
mucosa samples were characterized by an intense signal, perfectly
decorating the boundaries of all the epithelial cells in the crypts
and on the surface (Figures 6a and c). Regarding UC samples, a
focal reduction of the signal was observed (Figure 6b). Furthermore, in many crypts, whereas some clusters of epithelial cells
appeared to exhibit E-cadherin staining, the contiguous epithelial
cells were completely unstained (Figure 6d). In colon samples from
patients treated with anti-inﬂammatory drugs, E-cadherin expression pattern was superimposable to that of normal, control colonic
mucosa (Figure 6e). The same results were obtained with the
immunoﬂuorescence analysis (Supplementary Figures 12a–e).

DISCUSSION
The present results highlight a new mechanism that may link
chronic inﬂammation to cancer, based on p53 downregulation,
which is activated by the enhancement of rRNA transcription
upon IL-6 exposure. By using human cell lines we demonstrated
that IL-6-stimulated c-MYC mRNA IRES translation. The consequent
increase in c-myc protein expression was responsible for the
upregulation of rRNA transcription. The enhanced rRNA transcription stimulated the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 throughout the ribosome protein–MDM2–p53 pathway.12,13 The reduction
in p53 protein level was associated with a decrease in the function
of p53, which activated the EMT program and increased the
invasiveness potential of IL-6-exposed cells. The downregulation
of p53 protein expression was exclusively due to the upregulated
ribosome biogenesis. This was demonstrated by the observation
that c-MYC silencing counteracted the stimulatory effect of IL-6 on
rRNA transcription, whereas IL-6 exposure did not reduce p53
protein level in cells in which the rRNA transcription could not be
stimulated as a consequence of RNA polymerase I-depletion.
These effects appeared to be very likely independent of STAT3
activation. There is evidence that STAT3 has a crucial role in
inﬂammation-associated tumorigenesis, namely in the colon and
liver,5–8 and IL-6 is the major activator of STAT3, which stimulates
the transcription of target genes whose products increase cell
proliferation and survival.30 On the other hand, our results suggest
that the IL-6 effects reported in the present study were
independent of the activation of the STAT3 pathway. In fact,
consistently with the data reported on myeloma cell lines,17 we
observed that IL-6 induced an enhanced expression of c-myc
protein as early as 1 h after exposure by stimulating c-MYC mRNA

IRES translation without modifying c-MYC mRNA transcription.
Therefore, this ruled out the possibility that the increased level of
c-myc protein might be the consequence of transcriptional
changes of c-MYC mRNA expression due to STAT3 activation by
IL-6. The increased c-MYC mRNA IRES translation was likely the
effect of the IL-6 activation of the MAPK pathway.30 Indeed, in
myeloma cell lines, IL-6 stimulation of the c-MYC-IRES function
was induced by phosphorylation and the cytoplasmic localization
of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A1, an IRES-transactivating factor, in a MAPKdependent fashion.31
The downregulation of p53 expression may be of primary
importance in the process of cell transformation in inﬂamed
tissues. In fact, together with the production of cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors, which stimulate the proliferation
and antiapoptotic activity, inﬂammatory cells generate reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species,1 which cause DNA oxidative
damages that may no longer be adequately repaired, because
of the downregulated function of p53. This may lead to epigenetic
alterations of both oncogenes and other tumor suppressor genes
responsible for neoplastic transformation and progression. This
mechanism may be operative in chronically inﬂamed tissues, such
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

as the human colon mucosa with UC. Indeed, our histochemical
and immunohistochemical ﬁndings obtained using colon biopsy
samples from UC patients were quite consistent with the results
from the study conducted on human cell lines.
In fact, we found that the epithelial cells of patients with UC
disease were characterized by a nucleolar hypertrophy, which
indicates an upregulated rRNA synthesis,15 a downregulation of
p53 expression and a reduction of E-cadherin expression, which is
a major phenotypic change indicating the activation of the EMT
program.27 The IL-6-induced p53 downregulation mechanism of
tumorigenesis in UC is shown schematically in Figure 7, as it may
be suggested by the present ﬁndings. This mechanism is likely to
be functionally active also in other inﬂammatory foci in which
IL-6 is produced and in which IL-6 induces an upregulation of
the nucleolar activity, similar to what happens in the epithelial
cells of the surface and crypts of human colonic mucosa
with UC. Indeed, there is evidence that human hepatocytes in
hepatitis virus-related cirrhosis are characterized by a marked
nucleolar hypertrophy, and it is worth noting that the number
of hepatocytes with nucleolar hypertrophy was directly
associated with an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma
development.32

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Samples of 10 patients (5 males, mean age 49.8±10.3 years) with UC and 5
healthy subjects (3 males, mean age 45.6±9.6 years) were used for the
study. After informed consent, biopsy specimens were obtained during
colonoscopy performed for a routine clinical care and surveillance. The
diagnosis of UC was based on conventional clinical, endoscopic and
pathohistological criteria as described by Lennard-Jones.33 Biopsies from
patients without macroscopic abnormalities or histories of any
gastrointestinal disease were used as the control group. All UC patients
had suffered from pancolitis for more than 10 years. In all UC cases,
specimens were obtained from the rectum and the descendent, transverse
and ascending colon. All UC patients underwent an initial colonoscopy
during active disease, and then a second endoscopy was performed during
a clinical remission conﬁrmed by histology. The remission of UC was
obtained with corticosteroid therapy and afterwards maintained with
mesalazine. The collected samples were ﬁxed in formalin and embedded in
parafﬁn for histological examination.

NOR silver staining
AgNOR staining and morphometric analysis were performed as
described.15 For each case, the AgNOR area of at least 200 nuclei was
measured and the mean (s.d.) AgNOR area was calculated.

Immunohistochemical assessment
A non-biotin-ampliﬁed method (NovoLinkTM Polymer Detection System,
Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) was used for
visualizing antigens in tissue sections. The sections were subsequently
incubated with primary anti-E-cadherin (clone 32A8, Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), anti-IL-6 (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-p53
(Novocastra) antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris buffer
saline overnight at 4 1C using the appropriate dilutions. The slices were
then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and coverslipped.
Nuclear p53 immunostaining was assessed by image cytometry, using the
Cytometrica program (C&V, Bologna, Italy). Staining was expressed as the
percentage of labeled nuclear area over the total nuclear area of epithelial
cells in the section labeling index according to Faccioli et al.34

Cell lines and chemical treatments
HepG2, SW1990 and LS174T cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, and the NCM460 cell line was purchased from INCELL
Corporation (San Antonio, TX, USA). All the cell lines were p53 wild-type. The
HCT116 p53  /  cell line was a generous gift from Professor Bert Vogelstein.
The recombinant human IL-6 (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used at a
ﬁnal concentration of 50 ng/ml; the proteasome inhibitor MG-132
(Calbiochem, Merck, Nottingham, UK) was used at a ﬁnal concentration
of 10 mM; cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a concentration
of 20 mg/ml; hydroxyurea (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 3.4 mM; 5-FU
(Fluorouracile, Teva Pharma Italia, Milan, Italy) was used at a dose of
20 mg/ml; Nutlin-3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a concentration of 5 mM.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells grown on glass coverslips were ﬁxed and permeabilized in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% paraformaldehyde and
1% Triton X-100, while sections were dewaxed, hydrated through
decreasing concentrations of ethanol, rinsed in distilled water, and
subjected to antigen retrieval treatment. Samples were washed in PBS
and then incubated in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich)
to block nonspeciﬁc binding, before incubating with the primary anti-SLUG
(clone L40C6, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-E-cadherin (clone 32A8,
Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies diluted in PBS and 1% bovine serum
albumin overnight at 4 1C. Samples were subsequently rinsed in PBS and

and b-glucuronidase mRNAs were evaluated by real-time–PCR. TP53,
POLR1A and c-MYC and the internal control b-glucuronidase mRNAs were
quantiﬁed with TaQMan Gene Expression Assays primers and probe kits
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA); primers for SYBR Green
real-time–PCR analysis of human 45S rRNA, RPL11, BAX and PUMA were
designed using the Roche online primers design tool. All sequences are
available on request.

Genes silencing by RNAi transfection
Select stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) targeted against TP53, c-MYC and RPL11
and the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase I (POLR1A) were used. Control
silenced cells (scrambled) were transfected with equivalent amounts of
Stealth RNAi negative control (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with
lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s procedures.

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
The immunoblotting, isolation of nuclear protein fractions and immunoprecipitation procedures were performed as previously described.11
Antibodies used in this work were as follows: anti-p53 (clone BP53-12,
Novocastra), anti-b-actin (clone AC-74, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-MDM2 (clone
SMP14 and clone H-221, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-L11 (clone 3A4A7,
Invitrogen), anti-SLUG (clone L40C6, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Ecadherin (clone 32A8, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-c-Myc (Cell Signaling
Technology) and anti-Lamin B (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

mRNA transfection
For RNA transfection, capped mRNA was transcribed from linearized pR-cMYC-IRES-F (gift from Professor RJ Schneider) and a control pRF plasmid, as
previously described,35 using the mMessage mMachine T3 kit (Ambion).
Cells were transfected with 0.4 mg RNA/sample using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 8 h
transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed with a dual-luciferase
assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell invasion assay

Figure 7. Suggested pathway linking chronic inflammation to
cancer. In inflamed tissues, such as colon mucosa with UC, a high
amount of IL-6 is produced. IL-6 upregulates c-myc protein
expression, which, in turn, enhances ribosome biogenesis. The
enhanced ribosome biogenesis is responsible for an increased
MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. This, on one hand, may favor the
EMT of the epithelial cells, and, on the other hand, may reduce the
cell response to genotoxic DNA damages. Both consequences can
greatly favor cancer onset.

Invasion assay was performed using Boyden chambers (New Technologies
Group, Milan, Italy) containing a polyvinyl pyrrolidone-free polycarbonate
ﬁlter with 8 mm pores. Membranes were coated with 15 mg Matrigel (SigmaAldrich). Cells were seeded in the upper chamber in serum-free medium in
the presence or absence of IL-6 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37 1C. Complete
medium was placed in the lower compartment as a chemoattractant. After
incubation, invading cells in the lower surface were ﬁxed in ice-cold
methanol, stained with toluidine blue staining (Sigma-Aldrich), and scored
as the mean number of invaded cells per 10 random optical ﬁelds, in three
independent experiments, at  20 magniﬁcation.

Statistical analysis
The w2 or Mann–Whitney U-test, when appropriate, was used for the
comparisons among groups. Agreement between scores was assessed by
k statistics. All statistics were obtained using the SPSS statistical software
package (SPSS, Inc.). P-values o0.05 were regarded as statistically signiﬁcant.

were performed using the ‘pro long antifade reagent with DAPI’
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and observed under a ﬂuorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Milan, Italy).
