ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with many
drug targets contributing to its etiology. Despite the devastating effects of this disease,
therapeutic methods for treating Alzheimer’s disease remain limited. The multifactorial
nature of Alzheimer’s disease strongly supports a multi-target rationale as a drug
design strategy. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and cyclin-dependent kinase 5
have been identified as being involved in the pathological hyperphosphorylation
of tau proteins, which leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and causes
Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, using a molecular docking method to screen a
virtual library, we discovered molecules that can simultaneously inhibit Glycogen
synthase kinase-3 beta and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 as lead compounds for the
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The docking results revealed the key residues in the
substrate binding sites of both Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta and cyclin-dependent
kinase 5. A receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the docking model
consistently and selectively scored the majority of active compounds above decoys.
The pre-treatment of cells with screened compounds protected them against Aβ25-35induced cell death by up to 80%. Collectively, these findings suggest that some
compounds have potential to be promising multifunctional agents for Alzheimer’s
disease treatment.

strategy of developing multi-target drugs has become an
active field, and approximately 20 multi-target drugs have
been approved or are in advanced development stages [5].
Therefore, the complex etiology of AD has encouraged
active research on multi-target AD drugs.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) is a
proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that is responsible
for the phosphorylation of a variety of cellular substrates
[6]. GSK-3β is involved in the regulation of a wide
range of cellular processes, including metabolism, cell
proliferation, cardiac hypertrophy, oncogenesis and
apoptosis. Although GSK-3β is perhaps best known as
a potential drug target for metabolic conditions such as
type-2 diabetes and insulin resistance due to the effects of
this enzyme on glycogen metabolism, GSK-3β is highly

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common
neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause
of dementia with ageing. The etiology of this disease is
rather complex and not completely understood, but certain
indicators such as low levels of acetylcholine, β-amyloid
(Aβ) deposits, tau protein aggregation, neurofibrillary
tangles, oxidative stress, and the dyshomeostasis of
biometals are considered the cause of the pathogenesis
[1–4]. Designing drugs with a specific multi-target
profile is a promising approach to multifactorial illnesses
because the simultaneous modulation of multiple targets
in a biological network is beneficial in treating a complex
disease. With the development of polypharmacology, the

expressed in the brain and is linked to a variety of central
nervous system (CNS) disease states, including AD,
Huntington’s disease and stroke [7, 8].
There is strong evidence that GSK-3β co-localizes
preferentially with NFTs. GSK-3β is active in pre-tangle
neurons and contributes to the formation of paired helical
filaments (PHFs) in the AD brain [9]. GSK-3β has been
shown to phosphorylate tau protein at some of the sites
that are hyperphosphorylated in PHFs both in transfected
mammalian neuronal cells and in vivo. In addition to
its role in tau protein phosphorylation, GSK-3β is also
involved in regulating other AD-related mechanisms.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is an atypical and
essential member of the CDK family of proline-directed
serine/threonine kinases with no evident role in cell cycle
progression. CDK5 is an essential neuro-differentiation
and neuro-protective role in normal neuronal physiology,
that is directly linked to multiple neurological diseases,
such as AD, Parkinson's disease and Huntington’s disease
[10]. The activation of CDK5 is triggered by the binding
of the regulatory subunits p35 or p39 [11]. The CDK5/
p35 complex could hyperphosphorylates tau protein and
reduces the association of tau protein with microtubules,
resulting in cytoskeletal alterations and neuronal apoptosis.
This phosphorylation has been described as a key point in
controlling the activation of CDK5 [12–14]. It has been
observed in cellular experimental models that Aβ stimulates
the cleavage of p35 to p25, and the inhibition of CDK5
reduces Aβ-evoked cell death. Moreover, a post-mortem
analysis of the brain preparations from AD patients indicates
an accumulation of p25 and an increase in CDK5 activity
[15]. Furthermore, CDK5 has been shown to potentiate tau
protein phosphorylation by priming sites for subsequent
phosphorylation by GSK-3β. Therefore, CDK5 is considered
to be a therapeutic target for the treatment of AD [16, 17].
Protein kinases have become major screening
targets in drug design because these enzymes are involved
in all major human diseases. GSK-3β and CDK5 are
both important in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, these
proteins have been extensively used as targets to identify
pharmacological inhibitors of potential therapeutic
interest. Many CDK5 and GSK-3β inhibitors have been
identified, most of which act by competing with ATP for
binding at the kinase catalytic site. Among these inhibitors,
indirubin and its analogs have raised considerable interest.
Indirubin isomers have been isolated from marine
organisms. The natural product 6-bromoindirubin and its
synthetic derivative, 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime, display
increased selectivity for the inhibition of GSK-3β [18,
19]. Moreover, benzazepinones, pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazines
and 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines all inhibited GSK-3β and
CDK5 [16, 20].
In this study, we computationally designed multitarget drugs based on the polypharmacology concept,
which is currently being actively pursued. Multi-target
inhibitors that inhibit with both GSK-3β and CDK5 will be
beneficial in the prevention and treatment of AD. Previous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reports by Li et al. [21] and Olivia et al. [22] provide
good perspectives regarding this point. Using a virtual
screening method, we screened out novel structures as top
leads for AD. 4H-benzo[d][1, 3]oxazin-4-one, phthalazin1(2H)-one and 3-hydroxy-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one have dual
activity as both GSK-3β and CDK5 inhibitors and were
designed by computational methods, and these structures
are different from those used in previous modeling studies
[21]. The drug-like properties of these compounds were
predicted. Moreover, we demonstrated that the identified
compounds can inhibit Aβ25-35-induced neurotoxicity in
SH-SY5Y cells.

RESULTS
Virtual screening for GSK-3β/CDK5
dual inhibitors
The threshold value of the docking energy
should first be determined. Co-crystalized ligands
are the best choice for this process. We docked the
ligands,
phosphoaminophosphonic
acid-adenylate
ester and (4-amino-2-(4-chlorophenylamino)thiazol5-yl)(3-nitrophenyl)methanone, in their crystallized
conformations to GSK-3β and CDK5, respectively, with
Autodock 4.2. The docking energies were -10.4 kcal/
mol for phosphoaminophosphonic acid-adenylate ester
(docked with GSK-3β) and -11.1 kcal/mol for (4-amino2-(4-chlorophenylamino)thiazol-5-yl)(3-nitrophenyl)
methanone (docked with CDK5). Therefore, in the virtual
screening step, the compounds with docking energies
close to -10.4 kcal/mol (GSK-3β) and -11.1 kcal/mol
(CDK5) could be considered as potential GSK-3β/CDK5
dual inhibitors. We finally set -10 kcal/mol (GSK-3β) and
-11 kcal/mol (CDK5) as the threshold values to retain
more diverse structures.
The first search process captured approximately
2,000 compounds that met the screening criteria for GSK3β. These compounds were then docked into CDK5. In
this step, 127 compounds were screened out, for which
the docking energies for CDK5 were all more negative
than -11 kcal/mol. The docking energies of these 127
compounds were provided in Supplementary Table 1.
It is an interesting observation that, for the same
compound, the docking energy of GSK-3β is more
negative than the docking energy of CDK5. This might be
caused by structural differences between the ATP-binding
sites of GSK-3β and CDK5.
The binding modes of the proposed possible dual
inhibitors for GSK-3β and CDK5 were further analyzed
using Autodock 4.2. This program consumes more cpu
time, but Autodock 4.2 predicts the binding conformations
and the binding energy of each docked compound more
accurately than Autodock Vina. Regarding GSK-3β/CDK5
docking using Autodock 4.2, most of the compounds
scored similar or better binding energy values compared
to the results from Autodock Vina. However, some

pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, eleven candidate
compounds were carefully selected by considering the
docking pose, structural diversity and druglikeness. The
eleven hits can be classified into many clusters, including
different singletons (Figure 1). The ClogP and PSA of five
hits screened out in this study are listed in Table 1.

Furthermore, we aimed to discover novel scaffolds,
which are helpful in the discovery of novel AD drugs.
“Drug-likeness” is widely integrated into the early stages
of drug discovery. Tools that estimate drug-likeness are
valuable in the early stages of lead discovery and can be
used to filter out compounds with undesirable properties
from screening libraries and to prioritize hits from primary
screens. Therefore, it is necessary to predict druglike

Binding modes of the identified hits
The binding modes and the molecular interactions of

3D docking model, we found that phenyl group in this
structure stretched to the hydrophobic pocket in the
binding site, which suggests that the hydrophobic pocket
formed by Val70, Val110, Leu132, Leu188 and Cys199
is very important for ligand binding affinities. Therefore,
the design of new inhibitors targeted to GSK-3β should
consider the properties of this region. Compound 6 is
another ligand with a more negative binding energy
for GSK-3β (Figure 3). The tetrazole in this structure
simultaneously forms two hydrogen bond interactions,
a π-positive charge, a π-alkyl and a carbon hydrogen
bond interactions. The carbonyl group in the thiazolone
ring acted as a hydrogen bond acceptor, and Asp200 had
a π-negative charge interaction with the thiazolone ring
in this compound. The only amide group in Compound 9
hydrogen bonded with Arg141 and Val135, and hydrogen
bond interactions contributed greatly to the binding
affinity of this compound (Figure 4). The comparison of
these compounds were provided Supplementary Figure
1. Compound 10 hydrogen bonded with Val135, Gln185,
Asn186 and Cys199. The hydroxyl group in the structure
can form three hydrogen bonds with Gln185, Asn186
and Cys199, respectively. Therefore, this hydroxyl group
should be kept in lead optimization process.
In the docking study of CDK5, the verification
process for Compound 8 suggested that the carbonyl
group of diazine ring was hydrogen-bonded to Cys83,

GSK-3β has a more negative binding energy and forms
more hydrogen bond interactions, which may be due to
the flexible structure of the side chain. The co-crystallized
compound in CDK5 (PDB code: 4AU8), (4-amino2-(4-chlorophenylamino)thiazol-5-yl)(3-nitrophenyl)
methanone, also formed hydrogen bond interactions
with adjacent residues (Glu81, Lys33, and Cys83). π-π
interactions and hydrophobic interactions were also
observed. Some distinctive candidates were chosen from
among the hits to illustrate the binding results. Most of
these compounds have not been reported as inhibitors for
any target, and these compounds were chosen on the basis
of the observed molecular interactions with the respective
important residues in GSK-3β and CDK5 (Figure 2–Figure
6). The binding modes and molecular interactions between
some of these compounds and the active site components
of both the targets are discussed below.
In this study, to gain insight into the potential
interactions between the ligands and GSK-3β/CDK5,
we evaluated all residues within 5 Å of the ligands. In
the docking study of GSK-3β, compound 6, compound 8
and compound 9 had better binding affinity than the other
ligands. The carbonyl group of the diazine ring and the
oxygen atom in the morpholine ring acted as hydrogen
bond acceptor in compound 8 (Figure 2). Furthermore,
Val70 and Ala83 formed π-alkyl interactions and Asp200
formed π-sigma interactions with compound 8. In the

and the predicted H-bond distance was 3.24 Å (Figure
5). The carbonyl group of the morpholine ring in the
structure was also hydrogen-bonded to residue Gln130.
Val18, Ile10, and Phe80 were also located within 5 Å
of Compound 8; however, these three residues were
involved in hydrophobic contacts rather than in hydrogenbonding interactions. As mentioned above, hydrophobic
interactions were also identified between Val18, Ile10,
Phe80 and Compound 9 (Figure 6); thus, it was obvious
that these residues are key residues in CDK5 ligand
binding. The oxygen atom of the ester group in Compound
9 acted as a hydrogen bond acceptor for Cys83. The NH
of the amide group and the oxygen atom of the methoxyl
group interacted with Asp84 and Gln85, respectively.
The comparison of these compounds were provided
Supplementary Figure 2.
The docking models were found to give
considerably good enrichment, suggesting that the
models are able to moderately accurately differentiate
between inhibitors and decoys. Two sets (Set I and Set
II) of compounds were collected together to produce
the enrichment data. We did not separately assess Set I
because the 200 reported inhibitors formed a small sample
size. However, we could not ignore the structural diversity
of these compounds, so we combined Set I and Set II. We
also chose to analyze the enrichment results obtained
from using Set II alone because, as a better match of the
molecular properties, compared to Set I, Set II is expected
to give unbiased results and provide a good reflection of
the actual performance of the screening process. The ROC

analysis of Set II had an AUC = 0.747, which is a little
smaller than the AUC (0.773) of the two sets (Set I and
Set II). A similar trend was observed for the two ROCs.
These observations are clearly illustrated by the ROC plots
shown in Figure 7.

The effect of hits on Aβ25-35-induced cytotoxicity
In this study, we selected eleven compounds to
test their protective effects on the cytotoxicity of Aβ25aggregation, Compound 01 – Compound 11. Aβ25-35

induces the neurodegeneration of cortical and hippocampal
neurons through oxidative stress, secondary excitotoxicity
and a wide range of molecular events that disturb neuronal
homeostasis. An MTT assay was used to determine the
protective effect of the hits on cell death. Aβ25-35 was
applied to cell cultures at a concentration of 20 μM, and
cell survival was assessed 72 h later.
As shown in the Figure 8, 20 μM Aβ25-35 significantly
decreased (66.16%, P < 0.01) the MTT redox potential
of the SH-SY5Y cells, whereas Compound 08 had an
inhibitory effect on toxicity when the fibrillation of Aβ25occurred in its presence, as indicated by the increase

in the MTT redox potential in the Aβ25-35+ Compound

that Compound 08 treatment reversed the cell viability

(82.91%, P < 0.01) significantly increased the cell
viability compared with Aβ25-35. These data revealed that
Compound 09 protected SH-SY5Y cells against Aβ25-35-

induced toxicity. The core structures of Compound 08
and Compound 09 are similar. They both have benzoheterocycle fragments. Furthermore, the carbonyl group
on the six-membered heterocycles of the two compounds
are both significant for ligand binding. Compound 05
(82.63%, P < 0.05) and Compound 10 (82.80%, P < 0.05)
can also inhibit the decreased cell viability induced by
Aβ25-35. Although the chemical structures of Compound
05 and Compound 10 are mainly different, they share the
same core structure, pyrrolidin-2-one. This structure is a
common fragment in kinase inhibitors and a known GSK3β inhibitor BIP-135 has this fragment. Pyrrolidin-2-one
is a rigid five-member ring and the carbanyl group in this
structure usually forms hydrogen bond. Of the eleven
tested compounds, compound 01 decreased cell viability
(12.80%, P < 0.05). We infer that compound 01 synergy
with Aβ25-35 to induce cytotoxicity.
The objective of the vitro experiment was to evaluate
whether screened compounds can successfully inhibit
Aβ25-35-induced toxicity in the human neuroblastoma
cells. There is currently no direct experimental evidence
to support the effect of 4H-benzo[d][1, 3]oxazin-4one derivatives, phthalazin-1(2H)-one derivatives
and 3-hydroxy-1H-pyrrol-2(5H)-one derivatives on
neurotoxicity and morphological deterioration. Thus,
to test our hypothesis, we directly conducted Aβ25-35
fibrillation in cell culture media in the presence of
Compound 08 and Compound 09 to determine whether

these compounds have a positive effect on neurotoxicity.
Furthermore, cell viability did not decrease after exposure
to these compounds, which suggests a good safety profile.

DISCUSSION
In summary, a molecular docking screening
strategy was applied to meet the critical challenges faced
in designing efficient multi-target drugs to treat AD.
Initially, a database of small molecules was docked with
GSK-3β using the widely accepted molecular docking
program Autodock Vina, and the compounds that had
good binding characteristics were selected for docking to
the second target, CDK5. Key residues in GSK-3β and
CDK5 were identified. To confirm the binding modes of
the compounds, we calculated the binding energies of
selected possible dual hits using Autodock 4.2.
We considered the accuracy of the docking study
by calculating the area under the ROC curve. The result
suggested that our docking model can clearly identify
inhibitors within a database. Moreover, the ability of a
compound to penetrate the BBB is significant for drugs
that treat AD. Therefore, we also calculated the ClogP and
PSA of the candidate compounds and found that most of
these compounds have good BBB penetrating ability.
The compounds with better binding characteristics
were selected as possible dual inhibitors of GSK-3β and
CDK5 to use in blocking tau protein phosphorylation.

shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The absorbance of untreated cells was normalized to 100%.

Reverse validation also suggested the same compounds
as possible dual inhibitors. In conclusion, five hits were
screened as multi-targeted agents for the treatment of
AD. Among these compounds, compound 05, compound
08, compound 09 and compound 10 gave the best results
and are potential agents for the treatment of AD. These
findings will be instrumental for rational design of drug
candidates for AD.

screening. In the next step, selected compounds were
docked with the active site of the second target (CDK5)
to examine the binding affinities of these compounds.
The binding modes of all the docked compounds were
analyzed according to their molecular interactions. The
compounds that displayed strong key interactions at both
of the binding sites were considered potential GSK-3β/
CDK5 dual hits. The compounds with high scores were
docked again to both target proteins using a different
molecular docking program (AutoDock 4.2) to verify the
accuracy of the screening results [24]. For the Autodock
4.2 verification process, the Lamarckian genetic algorithm
was used with a population size of 200 dockings and 25
million energy evaluations. The results were clustered
according to the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
criterion. The final result was determined based on a
combination of clustering, energy and interacting residue
data.
Enrichment studies were carried out to test the
ability of the GSK-3β docking model to differentiate
inhibitors from decoys. Therefore, additional docking
studies were performed on 200 reported GSK-3β
inhibitors (Set I), and a set of structures (Set II) was
selected based on molecular properties from the ZINC
database [28–35]. There were 877 ligands in Set II,
which was non-randomly selected from the ZINC
database [36]. We followed the rules below to select the
molecules of Set II: a molecular weight from 350 to 500,
an XLogP value from 1 to 4, a hydrogen-bond-donor
count from 1 to 5, a hydrogen-bond-acceptor count
from 5 to 10 and a TPSA from 0 to 90. These parameters
would indicate favorable drug-like properties. Compared
with previously reported inhibitors, Set II had more
closely matched chemical properties and was considered
to contain efficient challengers for the inhibitors. The
inhibitors retrieved from the literature were prepared
using Discovery Studio 2.5 to assign appropriate
protonation states [37], generate tautomers and optimize
the geometry prior to the docking calculations. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were prepared by
plotting the true-positive rate against the false-positive
rate. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) value was
calculated to measure the early recognition performance
and the overall predictive performance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virtual screening
We used an efficient molecular docking software,
Autodock Vina [23], to select more diverse active
compounds. We screened 181,057 compounds from the
Specs library with our docking model for GSK-3β/CDK5
inhibitors as the query. In the virtual screening step, the
docking score is the binding energy and the best docking
mode is considered the conformation with the more
negative binding energy [24, 25].
The crystal structures of GSK-3β (PDB code:
1J1B) and CDK5 (PDB code: 4AU8) were retrieved
from the Protein Data Bank [26, 27]. In the PDB file,
GSK-3β was co-crystallized with a small molecule,
phosphoaminophosphonic acid-adenylate ester, interacting
with Asp133, Val135, Arg141, Gln185, and Lys85. The
CDK5 PDB file contains the coordinates for the monomers
B (CDK5) and E (p25). The compound (4-amino-2(4-chlorophenylamino)thiazol-5-yl)(3-nitrophenyl)
methanone was co-crystallized with the two proteins, and
this compound interacts with Glu81, Lys33, and Cys83.
The selected structure of CDK5 contains missing residues
in the vicinity of the active site, and we constructed all
the missing residues in the CDK5 structure using Build
Homology Models in Discovery Studio 2.5. The PDB
files were processed with Discovery Studio 2.5. All the
hydrogen atoms were added, followed by ensuring that
multiple bond orders were correctly defined and that the
hydrogen atoms were properly added for all amino acids.
The co-crystallized ligand, the solvent water molecules
and other cofactors were removed.
The model of the protein was converted to a PDBQT
format using AutoDock Tools 1.5.6; Kollman united atom
partial charges were then assigned for the receptor. The
grid size of the search space was set at 40 Å × 40 Å × 40
Å centered on the binding site, with a default grid-point
spacing of 0.375 Å.
Our strategy to discover dual-target inhibitors
began with the preparation of the ligand database,
which was then docked with the active site of a target
protein, thus predicting the binding conformations and
molecular interactions. Based on a binding-mode analysis,
compounds with suitable binding characteristics that
exhibited strong interactions with key residues at the active
site of the first target (GSK-3β) were chosen for further

Physicochemical properties and predicted bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeability of CDK5GSK-3β inhibitors
The BBB is a highly selective permeability barrier
that separates the circulating blood from the brain
extracellular fluid in the CNS. The BBB is the bottleneck
in AD drug development and is the most important factor
limiting the future growth of neurotherapeutics. Therefore,
the likelihood that candidate compounds can cross the
BBB should be predicted.

and polar surface area (PSA) are crucial indicators of
BBB permeability [38, 39]. The CLogP of the hits were
calculated using the program Bio-Loom for Windows,
Version 5. The PSA was determined using the web tool
mprop (http://www.molsoft.com/mprop/).

Alzheimer's disease. 2002; 4:375-398.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates containing
complete medium and cultured for 24 h. The cells
were then treated with compounds at the indicated
concentrations for specified times. After drug treatment,
cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. Briefly,
10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each
well and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. After removing the
supernatant, 100 μL DMSO was added into each well.
The absorbance was measured at 490 nm. All experiments
were repeated 3 times; 10 μM compound (dissolved in
DMSO) was added to the cultures 1 h prior to the 24h
Aβ25-35 exposure.
