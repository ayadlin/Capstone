Abstract
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) attract increasing attention as potential cancer drug targets due to
their ability to stimulate, for example, tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the
molecular mechanisms causing the tumor-promoting properties of CAFs remain poorly understood. Forkhead box F1 (FoxF1) is a mesenchymal target of hedgehog signaling, known to regulate mesenchymalepithelial interactions during lung development. Studies with FoxF1 gain- and loss-of-function fibroblasts
revealed that FoxF1 regulates the contractility of fibroblasts, their production of hepatocyte growth factor
and fibroblast growth factor-2, and their stimulation of lung cancer cell migration. FoxF1 status of fibroblasts was also shown to control the ability of fibroblasts to stimulate xenografted tumor growth. FoxF1
was expressed in CAFs of human lung cancer and associated with activation of hedgehog signaling. These
observations suggest that hedgehog-dependent FoxF1 is a clinically relevant lung CAF-inducing factor, and
support experimentally the general concept that CAF properties can be induced by activation of developmentally important transcription factors. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2644–54. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The tumor stroma provides a microenvironment that is
critical for cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastatic
progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a major constituent of the tumor stroma (1–4). CAFs commonly
display myofibroblastic characteristics, including a prominent contractile ability and expression of α smooth muscle
actin (αSMA). CAFs play key roles in promoting cancer
progression via direct cell-cell interaction, through soluble
factors such as growth factors and chemokines, or by
modification of extracellular matrix components. They also
participate in the modulation of inflammatory response or
tumor angiogenesis. Direct targeting of CAFs, and targeting

of CAF-derived factors, is attracting increasing attention as
a novel strategy for cancer treatment (5, 6). It is becoming
recognized that CAFs are heterogeneous and are likely to
be composed of subsets, still remaining to be better defined (7–9).
The regulatory mechanisms that induce and control the
CAF properties still remain largely unknown. Among
the paracrine factors that act on fibroblasts, members of
the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) families have been implied
as major regulators of CAFs. TGF-β can directly induce
transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and is
crucial for remodeling of extracellular matrices (10–12).
PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant of fibroblasts
(13, 14). A recent study also identified induction of osteopontin as an important mechanism whereby fibroblasts stimulated by PDGF promote cancer growth (15). CXCL14 is
another, recently identified, stimulator of CAF activity (16).
In spite of these progresses, it is noteworthy that key transcription factors regulating CAFs have not been described.
Forkhead box F1 (FoxF1) is a transcription factor critically
involved in mesenchymal-epithelial interaction of lung and
gut morphogenesis. FoxF1 is expressed in descendants of
splanchnic mesoderm (i.e., mesenchymal cells of organs
derived from primitive gut, such as lungs and intestine).
Foxf1-null mutants show early embryonic lethality, and haploinsufficiency causes multiple defects in trachea, esophagus,
lungs, and gallbladder (17–19). Moreover, experiments in
liver and lung injury models have shown the importance of
FoxF1 in tissue repair and homeostasis (20, 21). The importance of FoxF1 in human lung development is also highlighted

FoxF1 Regulates CAF Properties

by the recent findings that inactivating mutations of FoxF1
cause congenital malformations of the lungs (22).
It has been shown that hedgehog signaling can induce
FoxF1 expression during lung organogenesis, gut development, and vasculogenesis (19, 23, 24). Recent biochemical
analyses have also confirmed FoxF1 as a direct target of
hedgehog signaling (25). Based on the recent discovery
of hedgehog as an important paracrine signal for activation
of tumor stroma (26–28), this study tested the hypothesis
that FoxF1 plays a key role in tumor stromal cells, especially
in fibroblasts. Because FoxF1 is abundantly expressed in the
mesenchyme of lungs (29), the analyses focused on the
potential role of FoxF1 in CAFs of lung cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. Anti–α-tubulin, β-actin, FLAG,
and αSMA antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti–PDGF
receptor (PDGFR) α, PDGFRβ, and phosphotyrosine (phospho-Tyr100) antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Anti-CD31
antibody was from BD Pharmingen. TGF-β1 and PDGF-AA
were used at the concentration of 1 and 100 ng/mL, respectively. LY364947 (TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor) was from
Calbiochem and used at the concentration of 3 μmol/L.
Cell culture. NIH3T3, C3H10T1/2, A549, IMR-90, and 293T
cells and primary murine lung fibroblasts (MLF) were
cultured in DMEM. MLFs were isolated from the explant outgrowth of lungs derived from wild-type or Foxf1 heterozygous
mice. MLFs were immortalized by retroviral transduction of
SV40 large T antigen. To obtain the conditioned medium
of NIH3T3 and IMR-90 cells, serum-free Opti-MEM (Life
Technologies) and DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) supplemented with 20 μg/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used, respectively.
Cloning of the human FoxF1 cDNA. The open reading
frame of FoxF1, derived from the cDNAs of human lung
fibroblasts, was amplified by PCR using high-fidelity Taq
polymerase (LA-Taq, TaKaRa). The purified PCR fragment
was first cloned into pCR2.1 vector with TA Cloning kit
(Invitrogen) and subcloned into the retroviral expression vector MSCV-IRES-neo. Correctness of the final insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Retrovirus infection. Transient transfection into 293T
cells was performed using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). 293T
cells were cotransfected with the expression vector and ecotropic helper plasmid to produce culture supernatant containing retroviruses. Target cells were cultured for 48 h in
the virus-containing conditioned medium in the presence
of 10 μg/mL polybrene before drug selection with 2 mg/mL
G418 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Fluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed in 1:1 acetonemethanol solution and incubated with primary antibody diluted with Blocking One solution (Nacalai Tesque) for 1 h.
The cells were then incubated with secondary antibody for
1 h and stained with TOTO-3 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes).
Immunoblot analysis. The detailed procedures were described previously (16). Glycoproteins were bound to lec-

www.aacrjournals.org

tin-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and used for the detection of
phosphotyrosine, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. To obtain
clinical cases for mRNA expression analysis, immunohistochemistry for FoxF1 was performed on tissue microarrays
representing 190 non–small cell lung cancer cases, with
available corresponding fresh-frozen tissue samples. Sixteen
samples were selected based on stromal FoxF1 expression
(7 positive and 9 negative cases). Total RNA (RNA integrity
number values > 7.5) was isolated from 5 to 10 frozen sections (10 μm) using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The procedures of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis were described previously (16). Expression level
was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Primer sequences are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
RNA interference. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used for small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection into IMR-90 cells, and the final concentration of
siRNA was 100 nmol/L. Human FoxF1 siRNA (Stealth RNAi
HSS142031) and negative control siRNA were purchased
from Invitrogen.
Migration assay. Cell migration assay was performed
using cell culture inserts with 8-μm pore size (Corning). The
upper surface of the chamber was coated with 50 μg/mL of
type I collagen (BD Biosciences) diluted with 0.02 N acetic
acid. The conditioned medium was put in the well under the
chamber, and A549 cells lentivirally transduced with green
fluorescent protein (GFP; 6 × 105 per well) were seeded in
the upper side of the chamber. After 24 h, cells on the lower
surface of the chamber were trypsinized, resuspended in
PBS, and measured for GFP fluorescence. The experiments
were performed at least thrice.
Collagen gel contraction assay. Type I collagen [rat tail
tendon collagen (RTTC)] was purchased from BD Biosciences.
Collagen gels were prepared by mixing RTTC, distilled water,
4× DMEM, 10× gel contraction buffer (200 mmol/L HEPES,
2.2% NaHCO3, 0.05 N NaOH), FBS, and cells. The final concentrations were 1.5 mg/mL RTTC, 1× DMEM, 1× buffer, and
6 × 105 cells/mL. The mixture (500 μL) was cast into each well
of a 24-well culture plate. The solution was then allowed to
polymerize at 37°C for 30 min. After polymerization, the gels
were gently released from the plate and transferred into
60-mm tissue culture dishes. The surface area of the gels
was measured as the relative value compared with that of
the 6-cm dish. These values were normalized to that of the
control gel at 0 h.
Animal experiments. Severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice, 5 to 8 wk old, were from the Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology animal unit, Karolinska Institutet. The
mixture of 2 × 106 NIH3T3 cells or MLFs, with or without 4 ×
106 A549 cells, was resuspended in 100 μL PBS and injected
s.c. into mice. Tumor volume was approximated as a × b × c/2
(a, b, and c: three different axes). The animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with national guidelines and
approved by the Stockholm North Ethical Committee on
Animal Experiments.

(n = 8 for each group). The overlapping pictures of each
tumor were taken covering the whole tumor area for the
analysis. The area positively stained for CD31 was quantified using NIH ImageJ software.
Foxf1 knockout mice. Foxf1 knockout mice with C57/BL6
background were generated by Mahlapuu and colleagues
(30), and the detailed procedures of gene targeting and genotyping were described previously.
Lung tumor tissue microarrays. The analyzed tissue microarrays were composed of 247 cases, surgically treated for
stage I to IIIA lung cancer or carcinoid, at the University
Hospital of Lund, between 1981 and 1984 (n = 119) and
1995 and 1997 (n = 128). None of the patients had received
any systematic neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. There
were 154 (62.3%) men and 93 (37.7%) women. After histopathologic evaluation on H&E-stained slides, tissue microarrays were constructed as described previously (31). After
a median follow-up of 4.569 y, 53 (21.5%) patients were alive
and 194 (78.5%) were dead.
Immunohistochemistry for FoxF1 on tissue microarrays.
The antibody for FoxF1 was from the Human Proteome
Resource (Human Protein Atlas, Sweden) and was used
with 1:100 dilution (32). To retrieve the antigen, slides
were boiled in a microwave oven at 650 W in Target retrieval buffer, high pH (DAKO). The detailed procedures of
immunohistochemistry were described previously (33). By
light microscopy, the tissue sections were evaluated for
the nuclear staining of FoxF1 in CAFs, which were morphologically identified as stromal spindle cells. We excluded
the cases where fibroblasts could not be morphologically
identified. The positivity of FoxF1 in CAFs was scored as
positive or negative. All the samples were anonymized
and independently scored by two evaluators. In case of disagreement, the samples were reexamined and a consensus
was reached by the evaluators. Kaplan-Meier analysis and
log-rank test were used to illustrate differences in recurrence-free and overall survival according to FoxF1 expression in CAFs.

Results
FoxF1 modulates fibroblast morphology and expression
of CAF markers. To establish FoxF1 gain-of-function models,
NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts were retrovirally
transduced with control GFP or FLAG-tagged FoxF1. Cell populations were used for further experiments to avoid effects
possibly caused by clonal variations. Ectopic FoxF1 was located in the nucleus in these cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

About the efficacy of transduction, we noted GFP fluorescence
in 98% of the cells in the GFP-transduced cell population as
confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (data
not shown). Ectopic FoxF1 induced expression of integrin β3,
which has been identified as a FoxF1 target (34), confirming
that FLAG-tagged FoxF1 is functionally active (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
FoxF1 expression conferred morphologic changes, including a spindle-like shape, similar to the cells stimulated by
TGF-β1, whereas control cells displayed a round or cuboidal
appearance (Fig. 1A). Cells were also immunostained for
αSMA, an established marker of activated fibroblasts, which
is also commonly expressed in CAFs. Interestingly, forced
expression of FoxF1 resulted in enhanced staining of αSMA
in these fibroblasts (Fig. 1B, left). This effect was also confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, right).
To generate a FoxF1 loss-of-function model, IMR-90 human lung fibroblasts, expressing endogenous FoxF1, were
used for silencing experiments. IMR-90 cells were transiently
transfected with siRNA duplex specific to human FoxF1
(si FoxF1) or with control siRNA duplex (si NTC; Fig. 1C).
FoxF1 was knocked down to 32% of the basal level as confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1C),
and this effect was supported by downregulation of integrin
β3 (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Silencing of FoxF1 was also confirmed by FoxF1 immunoblotting (Fig. 1D, left).
IMR-90 cells treated with FoxF1 siRNA showed a more
elongated appearance at confluency compared with the control cells (Fig. 1C). Whereas control fibroblasts treated with
TGF-β1 showed larger cell size, cell morphologic change was
marginal even after TGF-β1 stimulation in the cells transfected with FoxF1 siRNA (Fig. 1C). Despite the differences
in cell morphology, silencing of FoxF1 did not influence overall expression of αSMA in a bulk population as determined
by immunoblot analysis (data not shown).
It has been reported that PDGFRα is expressed in CAFs of
a subset of lung cancers (33). FoxF1 knockdown resulted in
decreased PDGFRα expression (Fig. 1D) and attenuation of
its phosphorylation following PDGF-AA treatment (Fig. 1D,
right), whereas PDGFRβ expression was not affected.
The observed morphologic changes and FoxF1-dependent
expression of PDGFRα are thus compatible with FoxF1 being
involved in induction of lung CAF properties.
FoxF1 controls the expression of hepatocyte growth
factor and fibroblast growth factor-2. Hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) are
well-established CAF-derived stimulators of tumor growth
that act, predominantly, on malignant and endothelial cells,
respectively (35, 36). The expression of HGF and FGF-2 was

For further loss-of-function experiments, primary MLFs
from Foxf1 heterozygous mice were used, which were isolated
from genotyped mice (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Morphologic
difference was not obviously observed between wild-type and
heterozygous MLFs (Supplementary Fig. S2B). FoxF1 expression in heterozygous MLFs was reduced to approximately the
half seen in wild-type MLFs (Fig. 2C, left). Similar to the effect of
FoxF1 knockdown in human lung fibroblasts, the expression of
HGF was decreased in heterozygous MLFs (Fig. 2C, right).

These experiments reveal that the expression of HGF and
FGF-2 is regulated by FoxF1 and thus establish that FoxF1
controls the production by fibroblasts of tumor-promoting
paracrine factors.
FoxF1 controls the ability of fibroblasts to stimulate
lung cancer cell migration. Next, we explored the role of
FoxF1 in controlling fibroblast-stimulated cancer cell migration. The conditioned medium derived from FoxF1transduced fibroblasts was more potent, compared with

that from control fibroblasts, in stimulating migration of
A549 lung cancer cells (Fig. 3A, left). Similar experiments
were performed using conditioned medium from controltransfected or FoxF1 siRNA–transfected IMR-90 cells. Consistently, the conditioned medium derived from IMR-90 cells
transfected with FoxF1 siRNA was less potent in stimulating
migration of A549 cells (Fig. 3A, right).
FoxF1 enhances the contractile ability of fibroblasts.
CAFs and other activated fibroblasts are characterized by
enhanced contractile property, which can be induced by
TGF-β and PDGF (37). Tissue contraction mediated by CAFs
is considered as one of the causes of increased interstitial
fluid pressure, which hampers drug delivery to cancer tissues (38). To investigate the role of FoxF1 in the contractile
ability of fibroblasts, collagen gel contraction assays were
performed.

www.aacrjournals.org

FoxF1-expressing fibroblasts clearly enhanced collagen gel
contraction compared with the control fibroblasts (Fig. 3B). Consistently, Foxf1 heterozygous MLFs were less potent in inducing
collagen gel contraction compared with wild-type MLFs (Fig. 3C).
To investigate the TGF-β dependency of the FoxF1-induced
enhanced gel contraction, experiments were performed in
the presence or absence of TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor,
LY364947. The increased gel contraction ability of FoxF1transduced cells was also observed in the presence of TGF-β
signaling inhibition, suggesting that FoxF1 controls gel contraction through mechanisms that are largely independent
of TGF-β signaling (Fig. 3D).
The experiments presented in Fig. 3 thus establish that
FoxF1 status of fibroblasts controls functional activities
in vitro, such as stimulation of cancer cell migration and gel
contraction, associated with CAFs.

FoxF1 status of fibroblasts determines their ability to
support subcutaneous tumor growth. To address the in vivo
effects of FoxF1, coinjection of fibroblasts together with A549
lung cancer cells was performed.
FoxF1-expressing NIH3T3 cells were more potent in enhancing subcutaneous tumor growth compared with GFPexpressing control fibroblasts (Fig. 4A). All the xenografted
tumors derived from A549 cells coinjected with GFP- or
FoxF1-expressing NIH3T3 cells were composed of A549
cell–derived cancer tissues with gland-like structures and
surrounding stromal tissues. Histologic appearances and
epithelial-stromal ratios were not different between these
two groups, suggesting that the increase in tumor volume
is caused by enhanced proliferation of A549 cancer cells as
well as corresponding stromal cells (data not shown).
In agreement with these findings, coinjection of wild-type
MLFs with A549 cells resulted in enhanced tumor growth
compared with what was observed following coinjection with
Foxf1 heterozygous MLFs (Fig. 4B).
To further explore the tumor-promoting effect of FoxF1,
tumor angiogenesis was analyzed in tumors derived from
coinjection of A549 cells and either control GFP-transduced
or FoxF1-transduced NIH3T3 cells. Vascular density, as determined by CD31-positive area, was significantly higher in
the tumors derived from the mixture of FoxF1-expressing
fibroblasts and A549 cells (Fig. 4C and D).
Taken together, these findings thus show that FoxF1 status
of fibroblasts determines their ability to support subcutaneous tumor growth, and also suggest that enhancement of tumor angiogenesis is involved in the protumorigenic effect of
FoxF1-expressing fibroblasts.
FoxF1 expression in human lung cancer and its association with survival. To evaluate the clinical significance of
these model-derived findings, FoxF1 status was determined
by immunohistochemistry in human lung tumor samples.
For the validation of antibody, we confirmed that FoxF1 was
specifically detected in paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffinembedded FoxF1-transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Distinct staining of FoxF1 in the nucleus was observed in a
subset of lung tumor tissues and was restricted to tumor stromal cells (Fig. 5A). We focused on the FoxF1 positivity in fibroblasts (CAFs), which were morphologically identified as

stromal spindle cells. Of 247 cases, positive nuclear staining
of FoxF1 in CAFs was found in 110 (44.5%) cases. In a part of
these cases, stromal cells adjacent to the tumor cells showed
stronger staining compared with those further apart from the
tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). FoxF1 expression in
CAFs was observed in a variety of histologic subtypes of lung
cancer and was not significantly associated with any particular
subtype (Supplementary Table S1). Although FoxF1 positivity
in CAFs did not show significant association with survival in
the overall population (Fig. 5B, left), it predicted poor prognosis when restricted to the female population (Fig. 5B, middle)
as well as the patients of large cell lung cancer (Fig. 5B, right).
To further substantiate the in vitro studies showing that
FoxF1 controls the expression of αSMA, PDGFRα, HGF,
and FGF-2 (Figs. 1 and 2), the associations between FoxF1
expression and these genes were investigated in clinical samples. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR analyses, performed
on tumor-derived RNA, revealed significant correlation between FoxF1 and all these genes (Fig. 5C).
These results thus provide strong support for the clinical
relevance of the experimental results obtained from the tissue culture and animal studies described above.
FoxF1 expression is strongly associated with activation of
hedgehog signaling. Studies on the roles of FoxF1 during organogenesis have identified hedgehog signaling as a potent upstream
regulator of FoxF1 expression (19, 25). Potential associations
between FoxF1 expression and activation of hedgehog signaling
in clinical samples were therefore analyzed to obtain preliminary information on the mechanism(s) governing the differential FoxF1 expression in the stroma of human lung cancer.
Expression of Gli1, patched1 (PTCH1), and patched2
(PTCH2) was used to monitor hedgehog signaling activation
(39). The expression levels of these three genes were all
strongly correlated with the expression of FoxF1 (Fig. 6).
These findings thus suggest that activation of hedgehog
signaling is an important upstream regulator of the FoxF1
expression in human lung cancer.

Discussion
This study shows, through the systematic use of loss- and
gain-of-function models, that FoxF1 is a regulator of key

Figure 6. FoxF1 expression is correlated with hedgehog signaling activation. Associations between FoxF1 expression and that of hedgehog signaling target
genes (Gli1, PTCH1, and PTCH2) were investigated by quantitative RT-PCR as described in Fig. 5C.

FoxF1 Regulates CAF Properties

characteristics of lung CAFs. These include upregulation of
αSMA and PDGFRα (Fig. 1), secretion of paracrine growth
factors such as FGF-2 and HGF (Fig. 2), induction of contractile and migration-stimulatory properties (Fig. 3), and in vivo
protumorigenic effects (Fig. 4).
It has previously been shown that inactivation of one allele
each of Foxf1 and Foxf2 causes defects in gut development
and increases stromal Wnt5a expression, leading to epithelial
hyperproliferation (24, 40). In the current study, we have revealed that FoxF1 regulates the expression of protumorigenic
factors HGF and FGF-2.
HGF has been well studied as a fibroblast-derived stimulator of lung cancer cells (35) and thus is a candidate regulator
of FoxF1-mediated modulation of A549 cell migration. Furthermore, activation of PDGF signaling in fibroblasts leads
to upregulation of molecules that promote cancer cell migration,8 which could be another possible mechanism.
The mechanisms of protumorigenic and proangiogenic
effects of FoxF1-expressing fibroblasts in vivo remain to
be elucidated. Alterations of the composition of the microenvironments in the xenografted tumors, which involves different types of host-derived stromal cells, might be involved.
HGF and FGF-2 are candidate mediators of these effects.
Importantly, clinical relevance of these findings is supported
by the FoxF1 expression in human lung CAFs (Fig. 5). Finally,
the correlation between the expression of FoxF1 and markers
for hedgehog signaling (Fig. 6) suggests hedgehog pathway
as an important upstream regulator of FoxF1 expression.
An improved understanding of the molecular basis for the
protumorigenic properties of CAFs is of obvious importance
for understanding tumor growth and for the development of
novel stroma-targeted therapies. About CAF recruitment and
expansion, it is well established that members of PDGF and
TGF-β families play important roles (2, 14, 41). Recently, other
classes of paracrine signaling molecules, such as chemokines
and members of the hedgehog family, have also been shown to
stimulate the tumor-promoting effects of fibroblasts (16, 28).
In parallel with these studies, it has been investigated
whether genetic or epigenetic alterations underlie the CAF
properties. Strong evidence showing consistent epigenetic alterations has been provided (42–44). About the presence of
somatic mutations in CAFs, reports with conflicting results
have been presented (45, 46). However, it is noteworthy that
the information about key transcription factors governing the
CAF properties is the most limited. The present description
of FoxF1 as a potent inducer of the CAF properties thus re-

presents one of the first studies that identify a transcription
factor controlling functionally important CAF properties.
Our studies suggest hedgehog signaling as a key regulator
of FoxF1 expression in the stroma of human lung cancer.
Hedgehog signaling is receiving increasing attention as an
important pathway for tumor stroma growth and function
(47, 48). One key study emphasizing the importance of hedgehog signaling in tumor stroma showed therapeutic effects of
hedgehog inhibitors in several tumor models, where the malignant cells were not sensitive to hedgehog inhibitors (28).
The stroma-promoting action of hedgehog signaling is also
supported by studies in genetic models, which have shown
that ablation of the hedgehog receptor smoothened in epithelial cells did not affect pancreatic tumor growth (26). Furthermore, hedgehog inhibitors were also recently shown to
promote tumor drug uptake in a genetic model of pancreatic
cancer through mechanisms that involved remodeling of the
fibroblastic stroma (27). Our findings provide additional support for an important role of stromal hedgehog signaling,
including FoxF1 activation, also in lung cancer.
In conclusion, the study has identified FoxF1 as a previously
unrecognized clinically relevant regulator of lung cancer fibroblasts. The findings provide novel mechanistic understanding
of the molecular control of a key cell type of the lung cancer
stroma and suggest general principles to be further evaluated
in other types of cancer. The findings should thereby ultimately contribute to the development of novel CAF-targeting
therapies for lung cancer and other tumor types.
