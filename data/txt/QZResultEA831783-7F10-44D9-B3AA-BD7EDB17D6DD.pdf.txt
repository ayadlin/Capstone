Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor in which transient therapeutic responses are typically followed by
recurrence with lethal chemoresistant disease. In this study, we characterized the apoptotic responses in diverse
neuroblastomas using an unbiased mitochondrial functional assay. We deﬁned the apoptotic set point of
neuroblastomas using responses to distinct BH3 death domains providing a BH3 response proﬁle and directly
conﬁrmed survival dependencies. We found that viable neuroblastoma cells and primary tumors are primed for
death with tonic sequestration of Bim, a direct activator of apoptosis, by either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, providing a survival
dependency that predicts the activity of Bcl-2 antagonists. The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor ABT-737 showed
single-agent activity against only Bim:Bcl-2 primed tumor xenografts. Durable complete regressions were
achieved in combination with noncurative chemotherapy even for highest risk molecular subtypes with MYCN
ampliﬁcation and activating ALK mutations. Furthermore, the use of unique isogenic cell lines from patients at
diagnosis and at the time of relapse showed that therapy resistance was not mediated by upregulation of Bcl-2
homologues or loss of Bim priming, but by repressed Bak/Bax activation. Together, our ﬁndings provide a
classiﬁcation system that identiﬁes tumors with clinical responses to Bcl-2 antagonists, deﬁnes Mcl-1 as the
principal mediator of Bcl-2 antagonist resistance at diagnosis, and isolates the therapy resistant phenotype to the
mitochondria. Cancer Res; 72(10); 2565–77. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer remains a major cause of mortality, and the emergence
of therapy resistance is the principal barrier to cure. Nascent
cancer cells must bypass numerous apoptotic checkpoints that
safeguard against oncogenesis (1, 2), while established cancers
encounter therapeutics that interfere with vital functions to
activate mitochondrial apoptosis (3, 4). Not surprisingly, alterations that attenuate these pathways are selected for during tumor
initiation and progression, and "apoptosis evasion" is considered
an essential hallmark of cancer (5). Understanding how speciﬁc

cancers circumvent the apoptotic program is critical to identifying rational therapeutic approaches. Indeed, numerous agents
that target apoptotic mediators are under development and their
effective integration into clinical use requires such knowledge.
Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal pediatric solid tumor. Most
patients present with high-risk features (6), and despite intensive
multimodal therapy the majority die from progression of therapyresistant disease (7). The Bcl-2 family proteins govern mitochondrial apoptotic responses and are candidate mediators of therapy
response (8). They are classiﬁed by their highly conserved Bcl-2homology (BH) domains into the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins
(containing only the BH3 death domain), proapoptotic multidomain Bak and Bax (containing BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains),
or antiapoptotic multidomain homologues (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL,
Mcl-1, and A1; sharing BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains). BH3
proteins act as stress sentinels activated by a host of tumor-related
insults that include radiation and chemotherapy.
A subset of BH3 proteins can directly engage Bak or Bax at
the mitochondrial membrane, leading to their homooligomerization, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP), release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome
c, and death commitment. Such "direct activator" BH3 proteins
include Bim, Bid, and Puma (9). Alternatively, antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) can bind activator BH30 s
preventing Bak or Bax activation and providing a buffer against
cell death. These tonically neutralized activator BH3 proteins
can then be displaced by additional "enabler" BH3 proteins
(e.g., Bik, Noxa, and Bad) that have a higher afﬁnity for
antiapoptotic docking sites. The state whereby activator BH3

proteins are sequestered by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins has
been termed "primed for death" because such cells are paradoxically sensitized to select BH3 proteins (10). Of note, most
nontransformed cells lack BH3 priming, providing a conceptual therapeutic index for agents that antagonize the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (11).
We carried out mitochondrial proﬁling on neuroblastoma
cell lines that were genetically diverse to identify their set point
for apoptotic signal transduction following exposure to distinct BH3 death domains, providing a BH3 response proﬁle
(12). We identiﬁed 3 classes of apoptosis resistance that
accurately predicted sensitivity to the Bcl-2 antagonists in
vitro. Most neuroblastoma robustly and reproducibly
responded to speciﬁc enabler peptides, conﬁrming intact
Bak/Bax signaling and inferring that endogenous activator
BH3 proteins were tonically suppressed but displaceable (cells
were primed). One third of high-risk neuroblastomas were
most sensitive to BikBH3, suggesting a primary Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/
Bcl-w dependence and were exquisitely sensitive to the Bcl-2/
Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, ABT-737, in vitro (IC50 < 50 nmol/L). A
second subset had a dominant NoxaBH3 response (indicating
Mcl-1 survival dependence) and was relatively ABT-737 resistant. The third subset, consisting solely of cell lines derived at
relapse following therapy, had absent enabler and markedly
blunted activator BH3 peptide responses, a proﬁle consistent
with the profound therapy resistance seen clinically at relapse.
We hypothesized that relapsed neuroblastomas either lose
their primed for death status through repressed Bid, Bim or
Puma activation, or repress Bak/Bax-mediated pore formation.
We now directly show that neuroblastomas are primed for
death through sequestration of Bim, and that the pattern of
Bim binding is predicted by the BH3 response proﬁle. Furthermore, the dominant antiapoptotic site of Bim binding
predicts the in vivo response to small-molecule Bcl-2 antagonists. Xenografts from neuroblastoma with Bim sequestered by
Bcl-2 are exquisitely sensitive to ABT-737 and cures following
a single course of therapy were obtained. Importantly, this
includes tumors with MYCN ampliﬁcation and ALK mutations
(both R1275Q and F1174L) that are associated with an
extremely poor prognosis. Conversely, tumors with Bim
sequestered to Mcl-1 are resistant to Bcl-2 antagonists. Using
matched tumor cell line pairs obtained at diagnosis and
following relapse after therapy, we unequivocally show that
relapsed neuroblastomas retain Bim priming and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 dependence patterns indistinguishable from pretherapy cells. That acquired therapy resistance is associated with
repression of Bak and/or Bax-mediated apoptotic signal transduction implicates the mitochondria as a major contributor to
the postrelapse therapy resistant phenotype.

with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1% OPI, 100 U/mL of
penicillin. Tissue culture was at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2. All cell lines and isogenic pairs were
conﬁrmed with short tandem repeat (STR)–based genotyping
(AmpFISTR; Applied Biosciences) and matched to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) cell line genotype database
(www.cogcell.org).
Coimmunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer (10 mmol/L HEPES, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 2% CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich) and added to antibody–matrix complex [ExactCruz Immunoprecipitation
Matrix C plus 1–5 mg immunoprecipitation (IP) antibody] for
24 hours, 4 degrees. Immunoprecipitated proteins were
released from the matrix complex using 2 RIPA buffer, run
on Nu-PAGE 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes and detected for Bcl-2
family proteins as described (10). Primary frozen tumor samples were disassociated through a 0.45 mm sterile ﬁlter, washed
twice with Red Blood Cell Lysing Buffer (Sigma), lysed, and
immunoprecipitated as above.
Antibodies
Anti–Mcl-1 (BD Pharmingen), anti–Bcl-2 (DAKO and Santa

Mitochondrial proﬁling
Heavy membrane fractions enriched for functional mitochondria were obtained from neuroblastoma cells during logarithmic
growth, or from tumor xenografts, as described (19). Functional
studies were carried out with freshly isolated mitochondria
suspended to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL in mitochondrial
buffer, as described (20). BimBH3 peptide, recombinant tBid
protein (R&D Systems) or 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were
incubated with mitochondria for 30 minutes at 30 C and cytochrome c release measured in duplicate by ELISA (R&D systems).
Peptide synthesis and assay details are as in ref. 19.
Whole-cell JC-1 assay
Cells were plated at 2  104 neuroblastoma cells per well into
384-well plates in 300 mmol/L Trehalose, 10 mmol/L HEPESKOH, 80 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mmol/L
succinate; T-EB, and incubated at room temperature with 100
mmol/L BimBH3 peptide, 2 mmol/L JC-1, 20 mg/mL oligomycin,
0.01% digitonin, and 10 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, followed
by continuous monitoring for JC1 ﬂuorescence (BioTek Synergy Mx plate reader) at 545  20 nm Ex and 590  nm Em as
described (21).

(Invitrogen) and immunoblotted for Bak and Bax.
Cytotoxicity assays
A total of 2 to 5  104 neuroblastoma cells per well were
treated with ABT-737, cytotoxic agent, or vehicle controls in
RPMI-based media in triplicate. After 48 hours, WST-1 (Roche)
was added and incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. Absorbance was
recorded at 450 and 620 nm. For log-transformed nonlinear regression curve ﬁt and determination of IC50, Graph Pad Prism
software was used (Graph Pad Software). For short interfering
RNA (siRNA), 2  105 cells/mL were transfected with 50 nmol/L
Bim or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
siRNA (siGENOME SMARTPOOL; Dharmacon). Etoposide was
added 24 hours later, and viability was measured by WST-1.
Annexin–propidium iodide apoptosis assay
Neuroblastoma cells were treated with ABT-737, melphalan,
both agents, or DMSO vehicle control. Following a 24-hour
incubation, cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and
resuspended in Binding Buffer (8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g
Na2HPO 4 7H20, 0.24 g KH2PO4) at a concentration of 1  106
cells/mL. Cells were incubated with Annexin V–ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) for 15
minutes and then analyzed immediately by ﬂow cytometry
with the FACSCanto II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Murine xenograft studies
Xenografts were established in the ﬂank of nu/nu athymic
mice (Jackson Laboratories) as described (19). When tumor
volume reached 200 to 400 mm3, mice (n ¼ 10 per arm) were
treated by intraperitoneal injections of (i) vehicle control
(normal saline, twice weekly for 2 weeks), (ii) cyclophosphamide (CPM; 75 mg/kg, twice weekly for 2 weeks), (iii) ABT-737
(100 mg/kg daily  2 weeks, as in ref. 22), or (iv) the combination of cyclophosphamide with ABT-737 (according to their
monotherapy schedule). Animals were sacriﬁced when tumor
volumes exceeded 2,000 mm3 and all animal work was carried
out under a protocol approved by the CHOP and Emory
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Statistical analyses
Survival analyses were conducted according to the method
of Kaplan–Meier (23) with SEs according to Peto (24). Comparisons of outcome between subgroups were carried out by a
2-sided log-rank test.

Results
Bim is sequestered at the mitochondria of viable
neuroblastoma, inducing a primed for death state that
deﬁnes its antiapoptotic dependence
We previously used an isolated mitochondrial cytochrome c
release assay and inferred that most neuroblastomas were
primed for death as shown by robust responses to select enabler
BH3 peptides that are incapable of directly activating Bak or Bax
(ref. 12 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Using coimmunoprecipita-

tion assays and cell lines from different BH3 response classes, we
conﬁrmed that Bim is the principal BH3-only death activator in
neuroblastoma (Fig. 1A). All neuroblastomas that had a dominant cytochrome c release to the BikBH3 peptide had high Bcl-2
expression and endogenous Bim bound to Bcl-2. We predicted
these cells would have an activator BH3 protein bound to Bcl-xL
or Bcl-w, rather than Bcl-2, as Bik is more avid for these
hydrophobic pockets (25–27). However, Bik was discovered in
association with Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 interactive killer) and its proapoptotic function can be abrogated by Bcl-2, supporting a functional
interaction with Bik (28, 29). In support, BikBH3 peptide was
capable of competitively displacing endogenous Bim from Bcl-2
in neuroblastoma cells with Bim:Bcl-2 priming (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, all neuroblastoma cell lines that had a Noxa-dominant
BH3 response proﬁle had Bim neutralized almost exclusively by
Mcl-1, despite the coexpression of Bcl-2 in many (Fig. 1A). The
absence of ABT-737 responses for this subset reﬂects the
inability of this small molecule to antagonize Bim:Mcl-1, as
shown for other tumor models (8).
Bim was identiﬁed in complex with various antiapoptotic
partners in all neuroblastomas assessed, but neither alternative BH3 activators (Bid, Puma) nor multidomain Bak or Bax
proteins were sequestered by antiapoptotic homologues (Supplementary Fig. S2). Bim-EL was the only Bim isoform detected
in complex with Bcl-2 members and has been proposed as a
necessary BH3-only protein downstream of chemotherapyinduced stress (30), and as a tumor suppressor that cooperates
with MYC deregulation (30, 31). To test for a functional role for
Bim in neuroblastoma, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown
and showed Bim loss attenuated etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in line with resistant cell line IC50s (Fig. 1C; ref. 32). These
data suggest Bim is the major mediator of chemoresponse in
neuroblastoma but that its activity is suppressed by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Neuroblastoma cells in which Bim is
bound to Bcl-2 are extremely sensitive to ABT-737 in vitro
(12). We therefore reasoned that ABT-737 derived its potency
by displacing Bim from Bcl-2 and conﬁrmed this by treating
cells in culture with ABT-737 and showing a dose-responsive
competitive displacement of Bim (Fig. 1B).
To interrogate whether these Bcl-2 family interactions were
inherent to the primary tumor or secondary to cell culture adaptation, we carried out coimmunoprecipitations using fresh-frozen
neuroblastoma tumors of different risk groups obtained at
diagnosis (Supplementary Table S1). The same heterogeneous
Bcl-2 family binding patterns were identiﬁed, even within a single
clinical risk group. Two tumors showed dominant Bcl-2:Bim
priming (NBL-T01 and NBL-T04), one had Bim dominantly
sequestered by Mcl-1 (NBL-T02), and 1 tumor that showed no
evidence of Bim expression or priming (NBL-T03; Fig. 1D) failed
to show other activator BH30 s, Bid, or Puma, bound to Mcl-1 or
Bcl-2, suggesting it lacks priming altogether (data not shown).
Posttherapy relapsed neuroblastomas retain Bim
priming, but show repressed apoptotic signaling at the
level of Bak/Bax
The third subset of neuroblastoma cell lines identiﬁed by
mitochondrial proﬁling were characterized by repressed enabler

(direct activators), suggesting they either had lost Bim priming or
acquired apoptotic defects at or downstream of Bak and/or Bax
(12). Notably, these neuroblastomas were derived at relapse
following therapy. SK-N-AS, CHP-134, and BE2C had high Mcl-1
expression and sequestered Bim in patterns similar to neuroblastomas in the Mcl-1–dependent group, supporting no loss in
Bim priming at relapse (Figs. 1A and 2B). Only CHP-134 cells
seemed qualitatively to have reduced priming when comparing
whole-cell Bim levels with the Bim pulled down with Mcl-1.
We next assayed isogenic matched tumor cell line pairs from
the same patients at the time of initial diagnosis and at the time
of relapse following therapy (Supplementary Table S2). coimmunoprecipitation again showed that most pre- and postrelapse pairs retained consistent antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
expression as well as indistinguishable Bim priming patterns,
suggesting that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 dependence patterns are
not substantially altered in response to therapy (Fig. 2A).

Indeed, only KANR showed a gain in expression of an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue (Mcl-1) not expressed at diagnosis
(in KAN) yet this acquired Mcl-1 expression did not neutralize
Bim appreciably as minimal Bim:Mcl-1 was seen.
Immunoblots of Bim from whole-cell lysates conﬁrmed
consistent Bim-EL expression between pre- and postrelapse
cells (Fig. 2B). Although the initial cohort of postrelapse cell
lines we investigated had Bim:Mcl-1 priming, the additional
pre- and postrelapse pair studies identiﬁed neuroblastomas
with Bim:Bcl-2 priming as well. This suggests that cells in either
class could develop therapy resistance associated with maintained Bim priming but a reduction in BH3 responsiveness. We
therefore assessed ABT-737 responsiveness before and after
relapse in the context of both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 dependence. SKN-BE(1) (pretherapy) and SK-N-BE(2) (postrelapse) show Bim:
Mcl-1 priming, and as predicted, neither was sensitive to ABT737 (IC50s > 2 mmol/L; Fig. 2C). In contrast, both CHLA-15

with antibodies for Mcl-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL and immunoblotted for Bim and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. The identiﬁed dominant Bim interactions with the
multidomain antiapoptotic members are consistent with predictions inferred from BH3 proﬁle results (12). B, coimmunoprecipitations of Bcl-2 shows decreased
Bim:Bcl-2 interactions following exposure of isolated mitochondrial lysates to a BikBH3 peptide for 30 minutes. Likewise coimmunoprecipitation of Bcl-2 following
treatment of intact neuroblastoma cells with ABT-737 shows dose-dependent decreases in Bcl-2 bound Bim, supporting a competitive displacement model. C, Bim
or negative control GAPDH were inhibited using siRNA for 24 hours in IMR5 cells, followed by a 48-hour exposure to etoposide (VP-16). Survival was assessed by
WST-1. Immunoblots conﬁrmed target protein inhibition by siRNA. D, coimmunoprecipitation of fresh-frozen neuroblastoma tumor at diagnosis shows similar Bcl-2
and Mcl-1 sequestration of Bim. All experiments were replicated at least twice and representative ﬁndings shown. WCL, whole cell lysate; IP, immunoprecipitation.

viability using the WST-1 at 48 hours. As predicted, Bim:Mcl-1 primed SK-N-BE(1) and SK-N-BE(2) cells are ABT-737 resistant, whereas Bim:Bcl-2 primed
CHLA-20 cells show increased resistance compared with isogenic pre-therapy CHLA-15 cells. All experiments were replicated at least twice and
representative ﬁndings shown; error bars in C are representative of 2 or more independent biological replicates.

(pretherapy) and CHLA-20 (postrelapse, same patient as
CHLA-15) had Bim:Bcl-2 priming that predicts ABT-737 sensitivity, yet only the pretherapy CHLA-15 cells were sensitive
(IC50 ¼ 30 nmol/L) while CHLA-20 cells were relatively resistant (IC50 ¼ 620 nmol/L; Fig. 2C). This suggests that diminished
apoptotic responses seen in relapsed neuroblastoma are not
primarily due to loss of Bim expression or priming at antiapoptotic docking sites, but arise downstream of Bim displacement. We reasoned that the defective response to death stimuli
in relapsed neuroblastoma may reside at the level of Bak
and/or Bax activation or further downstream.
To explore this, we assessed the dose responsiveness of
isolated neuroblastoma mitochondria to the direct activator
BimBH3. In all cases, the pretherapy cells showed a heightened
responsiveness to BimBH3 than did their postrelapse counterparts even at concentrations that saturate antiapoptotic
binding sites (100 mmol/L; Fig. 3A). To ensure responses
reﬂected functional signaling, we also assessed cytochrome
c release in response to recombinant tBid with similar ﬁndings. To conﬁrm this, we used a complementary assay in
which mitochondrial membrane potential is measured in
intact cells using the JC-1 dye (21). Again, postrelapse cells
were less sensitive to direct Bak/Bax activation by BimBH3 as
gauged by JC-1 ﬂuorescence as a measure of mitochondrial
membrane depolarization. As a positive control, p-triﬂuoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenyl hydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler that induces
MOMP via a non-Bak/Bax mechanism, was capable of fully
inducing JC-1 redistribution (Fig. 3B).

We next investigated the proapoptotic Bak and Bax proteins
that are required for Bim-induced mitochondrial apoptosis
(33). In cell lines established at relapse postchemotherapy, Bak
and/or Bax were reduced in expression (Fig. 3C). SK-N-BE cells
had reductions in Bax in the relapsed lines [SK-N-BE(2) and
BE2C) with no reduction in overall Bak expression (similar to
KAN and KANR). CHLA-122 and CHLA-136 had no difference
in total Bax, but Bak levels were reduced in the postrelapse
cells (also with KCN and KCNR). CHLA-20 cells, in contrast,
showed reductions in both Bak and Bax expression compared
with the at-diagnosis isogenic CHLA-15. The functional status
of the Bak/Bax axis was assessed by oligomerization assays in
which higher order Bak or Bax homooligomers are detected in
response to a proapoptotic signal, BimBH3. Indeed, BimBH3responsive CHLA-15 cells showed higher order oligomerization of Bax in response to Bim that were absent in their
matched postrelapse counterpart, CHLA-20 cells (Fig. 3D).
Bcl-2 antagonists sensitize neuroblastomas with Bim:
Bcl-2 priming to chemotherapy
We next investigated whether the Bim:Bcl-2 priming patterns seen in a subset of neuroblastomas could be exploited
therapeutically. We tested neuroblastoma cell lines with a Bcl2–dependent proﬁle (SMS-SAN and LA-N-5), Mcl-1–dependent proﬁle (IMR5), or BH3-resistant proﬁle (SK-N-AS) for the
effect of ABT-737 on chemotherapy-induced death in vitro.
As predicted, in Bcl-2–dependent neuroblastomas, cell death
from doxorubicin and melphalan was enhanced by 5 nmol/L
ABT-737 (Fig. 4A). This synergistic loss of viability was due to

in CHLA-20 compared with CHLA-15 following direct Bax/Bak activation with BimBH3. Location of higher order oligomers have been previously
deﬁned (20). Nonspeciﬁc bands higher than 22 kDa in the Bak immunoblot are not consistent with functional higher order oligomers (20). Data are
representative of at least 2 biological replicates.

in vitro. However, mitochondrial signaling may be modiﬁed by
extrinsic survival cues from the microenvironment or additional stress stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, acidosis) that are not
recapitulated in vitro. We have shown that neuroblastoma cell
line BH3 response proﬁles are preserved in xenografts from
mice supporting that the deﬁning characteristics of these
responses are relatively cell autonomous (12). However, to
determine the extent to which in vivo responses to Bcl-2
antagonists can be predicted, we treated mice harboring
xenografts of neuroblastoma cell lines from different BH3
response classes with ABT-737 alone and with chemotherapy.
ABT-737 monotherapy induced notable tumor regression
and extended overall survival by approximately 50% in mice
bearing Bcl-2–dependent SMS-SAN xenografts (P < 0.005 by

ABT-737–treated mice and 14  3.2 days for control mice. For
neuroblastomas with Mcl-1 dependence (IMR5) or BH3 resistance proﬁle (BE2C), survival was not signiﬁcantly extended
by ABT-737 (Fig. 5; median survival 17  5 versus 12  3.5 days
and 12  5.3 versus 11  1.6 days, respectively). The response
of Bcl-2–dependent neuroblastomas to ABT-737 as single

agent supports that even in the context of in situ survival
signals the tonic repression of activated Bim is required to
maintain cancer cell survival and antagonism of this is sufﬁcient for antitumor activity.
Coexposure to a genotoxic agent and a Bcl-2 antagonist was
next assessed. We predicted that ABT-737, by saturating antiapoptotic binding sites, would prevent sequestration of the

excess BH3 death stimulus induced by chemotherapy (such as
Bim) and increase antitumor activity for tumors functionally
dependent on Bcl-2. A noncurative single course of cyclophosphamide was used. For each xenograft model, survival was
extended in cyclophosphamide-treated mice compared with
control-treated mice (P < 0.0001 by log-rank test) consistent
with the known antitumor activity of this drug in neuroblastoma, yet all mice had progressive tumor after a transient
regression (Fig. 5B, median survival of 22  7 days for SMSSAN; 25  7.6 days for IMR5; and 18  3.6 days for BE2C in the
respective cyclophosphamide-treated arms). Notably, the
impact on survival time for SMS-SAN xenografts treated either
with cyclophosphamide alone or ABT-737 alone were similar,
whereas in IMR5 and BE2C the effect of cyclophosphamide was
signiﬁcantly greater than that of ABT-737.
The addition of ABT-737 to cyclophosphamide induced
striking tumor responses in the SMS-SAN (Bcl-2 dependent)
model, with complete regression obtained in 5 of 9 mice (Fig.
5A). At the time the last cyclophosphamide treated mouse was
sacriﬁced for tumor progression (day 35), all cyclophosphamide-ABT-737–treated mice had tumors below pretreatment
volume, and median survival was extended to 126 days. Indeed,
4 of 9 mice showed no tumor regrowth at the time of sacriﬁce
(>220 days) despite receiving only single cycle of therapy (no
tumor was identiﬁed at necropsy). The addition of ABT-737 to
cyclophosphamide treatment did not signiﬁcantly increase
survival in the IMR5 Mcl-1–dependent model (median survival
of 35  10.9 versus 25  7.6 days), but did increase survival in
the BE2C BH3–resistant model by log-rank analysis, although
the magnitude of this response was modest (median survival 21
 6.4 versus 18  3.6 days) and all BE2C tumor–bearing mice
succumbed to tumor progression by day 50 (Fig. 5B).
We assessed a second Bcl-2–dependent neuroblastoma
cell line, NB-1643, and conﬁrmed robust activity. Tumors
regressed and survival was extended for both cyclophosphamide (median survival 64  12.5 versus 42.5  14.4 days)
or ABT-737 (median survival 59  10.4 versus 42.5  14.4 days;
P < 0.04 by log rank) treated mice (Fig. 5). Compared with those
treated with cyclophosphamide alone, all mice receiving both
cyclophosphamide and ABT-737 had signiﬁcant tumor regression (P < 0.001 by log rank) with 8 of 10 having complete
regression and 2 mice sacriﬁced for tumor progression on days
83 and 95. These ﬁndings underscore the utility of this classiﬁer
to identify tumors with a marked sensitivity to ABT-737.
To elucidate the mechanisms of Bcl-2 antagonist resistance
that might arise in response to ABT-737–selective pressure, we
exposed the ABT-737–sensitive SMS-SAN neuroblastoma cell
line to ABT-737 at 100 nmol/L in vitro and derived a cell line
capable of growth under these conditions. SMS-SAN-derived
and ABT-737 resistant (SAN-ABTR) cells expressed most Bcl-2
family proteins at levels similar to parent cells, except Mcl-1,
which was overexpressed (Fig. 6A). coimmunoprecipitation
revealed that Mcl-1 also became the dominant site for Bim
sequestration (Fig. 6B). SAN-ABTR cells were conﬁrmed to
have an IC50 of approximately 1 log greater than parental SMSSAN cells based on this switch to Mcl-1 for its survival bias
(Fig. 6C). CHLA-15 cells were similarly exposed in vitro to
obtain CHLA15-ABTR that switched from Bim:Bcl-2 priming to

www.aacrjournals.org

Bim:Mcl-1 priming, coincident with acquired ABT-737 resistance (Fig. 6B).
Although standard cytotoxics used to treat neuroblastoma
did not appear to select for alterations in the dominant antiapoptotic protein operative (see, Fig. 2A), exposure to a Bcl-2
antagonist in vitro did. We therefore sought to determine whether
SMS-SAN xenografts treated with ABT-737 and cyclophosphamide that regrew had acquired a similar resistance mechanism.
The ﬁrst 2 SMS-SAN xenografts to recur and progress were
harvested, and both the xenograft and the rederived cell lines
were shown to maintain a Bik-dominant BH3 response proﬁle,
nearly identical to the parent cells, and with no change in priming
dependency or BH3 proﬁle (Fig. 6D and E). We then retreated
the next 2 SMS-SAN xenografts that recurred with a second
cycle of ABT-737 and cyclophosphamide. Both xenografts again
completely regressed, with one mouse sacriﬁced at more than 200
days tumor free and the other succumbing to tumor at more than
50 days from the second treatment (Fig. 6D). Thus, over shortterm exposures to ABT-737 in combination with an alkylating
agent there was no selection for ABT-737 resistance despite our
in vitro selective pressure ﬁndings with single-agent ABT-737.

Discussion
Cancers are extremely heterogeneous, even within a single
histiotype. This is apparent in the divergent clinical responses
among similarly treated patients, and underscored by deep
sequencing results showing few highly recurrent oncogenic
lesions but scores of low prevalence mutations. Such heterogeneity provides a practical challenge in an era of targeted
therapeutics. Though the hope remains that this process will
lead to more personalized and effective therapies, providing
such agents for large numbers of distinct tumor genotypes
remains daunting. An alternative approach to improve cancer
outcomes is to target common downstream pathways that
mediate therapy response and resistance, agnostic to the
genetic heterogeneity that initiated or drives the tumor.
Targeting apoptotic programs to reengage death signaling
downstream of endogenous or therapeutic stressors provides
one such opportunity. We hypothesized that identifying the
apoptotic signaling set point of neuroblastomas, downstream
of their diverse oncogenic drivers and selective adaptations,
would inform our understanding of their survival dependencies and provide insight into therapeutic approaches. Importantly, understanding the survival biases (and associated heterogeneity) operative in this often lethal solid tumor ought to
have increasing therapeutic relevance as newer agents targeting the apoptotic pathway enter the clinic (Fig. 7).
Mitochondrial proﬁling identiﬁed heterogeneous response
patterns in neuroblastoma cell lines that are independent of
common driver lesions, as neither MYCN status, 11q LOH, nor
ALK aberration segregated within single-response proﬁle. Viable neuroblastomas have activated but tonically neutralized
Bim, providing a dependency that can be exploited therapeutically. Although Bim activation could arise as a tissue culture
artifact, primary tumor coimmunoprecipitations from freshfrozen tissue show similar Bim priming states as cell lines for
the majority, conﬁrming Bim activation and tonic sequestration exist in situ. Bim was conﬁrmed to be a principal mediator

of chemotherapy response, suggesting its tonic neutralization
provides a barrier to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Such a
role is supported by functional genetic screens in which Bim
knockdown induces resistance across multiple chemotherapy
drug classes (34) and is consistent with ﬁndings from the
Letai group correlating mitochondrial priming with chemotherapy response in multiple hematopoietic tumors and
ovarian cancer (11). Subsets of neuroblastomas have Bim
neutralized by either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, although we found no

binding, and Bcl-w was not evaluable as pull down of this

of Bim binding when multiple antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues are present remain to be elucidated.
Bcl-2–dependent neuroblastomas were exquisitely sensitive

Figure 7. Functional mitochondrial assays identify mechanisms of therapy response and relapse in neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma cell lines derived from the
highest risk tumors are primed to die with activated Bim sequestered to prosurvival Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, regardless of concomitant genetic aberrations.
Primary human tumors express Bcl-2 and/or Mcl-1 that confer poor prognosis, and diagnostic samples tested thus far show similar Bim sequestration,
inferring these ﬁndings likely translate to primary disease (41). Bcl-2 sequestration of Bim occurred in a large subset of neuroblastoma cell lines (>50%),
suggesting Bcl-2 inhibitors may have utility in treating neuroblastoma in the upfront setting. Neuroblastoma mitochondrial responses to BH3 death

Laboratories) that is in clinical trials (35, 36). We correlated a Bik-dominant mitochondrial response proﬁle with
ABT-737 sensitivity in vitro, conﬁrmed a mechanism through
competitive displacement of endogenous Bim, and showed
remarkable in vivo activity in a highly lethal xenograft model.
Single-agent activity for ABT-737 was recurrently shown for
Bcl-2–dependent tumors and combined with noncurative
chemotherapy led to durable complete regressions not previously seen in this model. This includes tumors with MYCN
genomic ampliﬁcation (NB-1643, SMS-SAN) and/or ALK
mutation (NB-1643, R1275Q mutation; SMS-SAN, F1174L
mutation), lesions independently associated with poor clinical
outcome (37–39). These data validate that phenotype-driven
predictors may be important for triaging novel therapeutics
for clinical use. The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program
(a National Cancer Institute–supported initiative to accelerate
the integration of new agents for pediatric cancer use) tested

ABT-263 across a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines and found
1 of 6 to be sensitive (40). This was NB-1643 that we show to
be Bcl-2 dependent with Bim:Bcl-2 binding, predicting this
response.
Importantly, Bcl-2 family expression and interactions in cell
lines are consistent with those we identiﬁed in primary tumors
(Fig. 1D; ref. 41). More than 80% of high-risk neuroblastomas
express immunohistochemistry-detectable Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, and
over a third of primary tumors express Bcl-2 alone, supporting
that Bcl-2 antagonists may have clinical utility for a large
subset of patients (41). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitations
conﬁrm Bim:Bcl-2 and Bim:Mcl-1 priming in distinct primary
tumors, suggesting Bim sequestration by Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 plays a
part in the pathogenesis of untreated tumors and infers a
predictive response to BH3 mimetics. For neuroblastoma cell
lines showing Bim:Mcl-1 priming, ABT-737 had little impact.
However, Mcl-1 is unique among Bcl-2 antiapoptotic

homologues as it has a short half-life and is highly regulated,
providing opportunities to resensitize Mcl-1–dependent
tumors to Bcl-2 antagonists through targeting regulators of
Mcl-1 expression.
BH3 proﬁles also deﬁned an apoptosis resistant pattern
exclusive to chemoresistant, posttherapy relapsed neuroblastoma (12). Using near isogenic pre- and posttherapy cell line
pairs, we show that this reﬂects attenuation of Bak and/or Bax
activation rather than a loss of direct activator BH3 priming or
gain of function of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
Though the mechanisms of this repression require further
investigation, these ﬁndings from mitochondrial assays (and
conﬁrmed by a complimentary whole-cell assay) isolate the
resistance phenotype to single organelle, the mitochondria,
and provide a new conceptual target for reverting chemoresistance. Understanding the broader functional attributes of
therapy resistant mitochondria may uncover vulnerabilities
that are distinct from both normal cells and pretherapy tumor
cells. Importantly, tumors with Bim:Bcl-2 priming (predicted
to be ABT-263 responders) are likely to have reduced sensitivity
to a Bcl-2 antagonist at the time of relapse based on our
ﬁndings. This has implications for how ABT-263 and similar
agents are studied in the clinic. Our data support integrating
such an agent into therapy before relapse, although clinical
development standards call for initial testing to be done in
patients at relapse, a patient population (based on our data)
that are likely to have tumors less sensitive to BH3 mimetics as
single agents. However, the data we present here, and preclinical studies combining ABT-737 with fenretinide (42), suggest
that recurrent neuroblastomas may be responsive to drug
combinations that include BH3-mimetic agents.
The functional mitochondria proﬁling approach used here
was initially applied to the characterization of hematologic
neoplasms (10, 43–46) and only more recently to select solid
tumors that arise in the context of an organ with dependence
on heterotypic cell types, contacts, and signaling (11). Our work
shows that despite this complexity, mitochondrial responses
from isolated neuroblastoma cells recapitulate in vivo

responses to similar stressors, and mitochondrial responses
to stressors that promote apoptosis are therefore more cell
intrinsic than might have been predicted. A more deﬁnitive test
of this concept will require assessing the proﬁle of more solid
tumor samples harvested directly from their autochthonous
primary and metastatic sites, and the subsequent demonstration that these proﬁles indeed predict response to Bcl-2–
directed therapeutics in the clinic.
