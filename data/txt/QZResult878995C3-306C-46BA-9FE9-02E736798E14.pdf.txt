Abstract

Author Manuscript

Colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, has been
treated with targeted therapies. However, the mechanisms of differential responses and resistance
of CRCs to targeted therapies are not well understood. In this study, we found that genetic
alterations of FBW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in CRCs,
contribute to resistance to targeted therapies. CRC cells containing FBW7 inactivating mutations
are insensitive to clinically used multi-kinase inhibitors of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling,
including regorafenib and sorafenib. In contrast, sensitivity to these agents is not affected by
oncogenic mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, or p53. These cells are defective in apoptosis due
to blocked degradation of Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein. Deleting FBW7 in FBW7wild-type CRC cells abolishes Mcl-1 degradation and recapitulates the in vitro and in vivo drug
resistance phenotypes of FBW7-mutant cells. CRC cells selected for regorafenib resistance have
progressive enrichment of pre-existing FBW7 hotspot mutations, and are cross-resistant to other
targeted drugs that induce Mcl-1 degradation. Furthermore, a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor restores
regorafenib sensitivity in CRC cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Together, our results
demonstrate FBW7 mutational status as a key genetic determinant of CRC response to targeted
therapies, and Mcl-1 as an attractive therapeutic target.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US 11.
CRC progression is driven by a series of well-defined genetic alterations, including
mutations in APC, BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA, p53, and F-box and WD repeat domaincontaining 7 (FBW7) 26, 42. FBW7, also known as FBXW7 and CDC4, is a tumor
suppressor frequently mutated in human cancers, including ~15-20% of CRCs 12, 35. It
functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which binds to phosphorylated substrates to promote
their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation 12. Heterozygous FBW7
missense mutations are often detected in three arginine residues (R465, R479 and R505) that
bind to a conserved CDC4 phosphodegron (CPD) motif of substrates upon
phosphorylation 12.

Recent incorporation of targeted therapies has improved efficacy of CRC treatment 10.
Regorafenib and sorafenib, multi-kinase inhibitors for targeting RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
signaling, have been shown to increase overall patient survival and approved for treating
solid tumors including CRCs 13, 18, 19, 25. Regorafenib and sorafenib inhibit CRAF, BRAF,
VEGFRs, PDGFR, c-Kit and other oncogenic kinases 44, 45. Their anticancer effects are
associated with induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and suppression of
tumor angiogenesis. The success of targeted therapies is highly dependent on the
identification of sensitive tumors 3, exemplified by the use of KRAS mutational status to
guide anti-EGFR therapies 1. However, no genetic or epigenetic factors underlying
differential responses and resistance to regorafenib or sorafenib have been identified, despite
the need for molecular markers to predict responses to these drugs 6.

Killing of tumor cells by apoptosis is a key molecular mechanism of targeted therapies 20.
Stress-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells is mediated through mitochondria by the Bcl-2
family proteins, which collectively regulate apoptosis by triggering a cascade of events,
including permeabilization of outer mitochondrial membrane, release of the mitochondrial
proteins such as cytochrome c, and activation of caspases 5. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1)
is a pro-survival Bcl-2 family member frequently overexpressed in various tumors 39.
Distinctive from other Bcl-2 members, it is a very unstable protein 30. Degradation of Mcl-1
can be triggered by various stresses 24, 34, 43, 46, 48, and regulated by kinases such as
glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) 27. Recent studies identified FBW7 as an E3
ubiquitin ligase that targets phosphorylated Mcl-1 for destruction 22, 43, suggesting that
FBW7 mutations may affect responses to targeted therapies through Mcl-1.

Author Manuscript

To understand the mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies, we investigated the
functional roles of FBW7 mutations and Mcl-1 degradation in determining responses to
targeted therapies. Our results suggest that FBW7 mutations mediate intrinsic and acquired
resistance of CRCs to targeted agents by blocking Mcl-1 degradation.

Results
CRC cells containing FBW7 mutations are insensitive to targeted drugs

Author Manuscript

To identify the genetic determinants of CRC response to targeted therapies, we analyzed a
panel of 16 CRC cell lines with different mutations in common tumor suppressors and
oncogenes, including KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, p53 and FBW7 (Table S1). Cells were
treated with regorafenib and sorafenib at different concentrations followed by analysis of
cell viability using MTS assay. A striking correlation was found between regorafenib
sensitivity and FBW7 mutational status (Fig. 1A). All 8 FBW7-mutant CRC cell lines were
substantially less sensitive to regorafenib compared to 8 FBW7-wild-type (WT) cell lines, as
indicated by higher inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) (Fig. 1B and Table S1). In contrast, no
correlation was found between regorafenib sensitivity and genotypes of KRAS, BRAF,
PIK3CA, and p53 (Fig. 1C). The FBW7-mutant cell lines were also significantly less
sensitive to sorafenib (Fig. S1, A and B; Table S1). Most (6/8) of the analyzed FBW7mutant cell lines contain a heterozygous missense mutation inthe substrate-binding arginine
or other residues of FBW7, except for SW837 and SW48, which harbor homozygous frameshift insertion and heterozygous frame-shift deletion, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S1C).
FBW7-mutant cell lines generally express lower levels of FBW7 protein than the WT cell
lines (Fig. 1D).
CRC cells containing FBW7 mutations lack Mcl-1 degradation

We then investigated the basis of regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity in CRC cells.
Regorafenib suppressed the viability of sensitive cell lines, including HCT116, Lim1215 and
RKO cells, at doses that induced caspase activation characteristic of apoptosis induction
(Fig. S2A). Regorafenib induced substantially higher levels of apoptosis determined by
nuclear fragmentation in FBW7-WT cell lines than in FBW7-mutant cell lines (Fig. 2A),
suggesting FBW7 determines regorafenib sensitivity by regulating apoptosis. Analysis of
Bcl-2 family members revealed dose- and time-dependent depletion of antiapoptotic Mcl-1
in regorafenib-treated HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B, S2B and S7A), which could be reverted by
wash-out of regorafenib (Fig. S2C). Mcl-1 depletion occurred prior to morphological
changes of cell death, and required similar doses of regorafenib as those for caspase
activation (Fig. 2B and S2A), suggesting a critical role in apoptosis initiation. An inverse
correlation between FBW7 and Mcl-1 expression was found in untreated CRC cell lines,
with FBW7-mutant cell lines generally expressing higher levels of Mcl-1 than WT cell lines
(Fig. 1D and S2D). Upon regorafenib treatment, marked Mcl-1 depletion was detected in all
8 WT cell lines, but not detected or much weaker in 8 FBW7-mutant cell lines (Fig. 2C).
Likewise, sorafenib also strongly induced Mcl-1 depletion only in WT cell lines (Fig. 2D).
In contrast, the expression of c-Myc and cyclin E, which are also FBW7 substrates 12, were
not significantly changed in regorafenib-treated HCT116 cells (Fig. S2E). The striking
correlation of regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity with FBW7 status and Mcl-1 depletion
suggests that FBW7 and Mcl-1 are pivotal in determining regorafenib and sorafenib
sensitivity of CRC cells.

FBW7-dependent regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity is mediated by Mcl-1 depletion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine the role of FBW7 in mediating regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity, we
analyzed isogenic FBW7-knockout (KO) HCT116 and DLD1 cells 35. Compared with the
WT cells, FBW7-KO cells were substantially more resistant to regorafenib (Fig. 3A and
S3A), and also deficient in regorafenib-induced Mcl-1 depletion (Fig. 3B and S3B).
Following regorafenib exposure, FBW7 expression was induced when Mcl-1 level started to
decline, and showed an inverse correlation with Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 3B and S3B).
Transfection of WT FBW7 into FBW7-KO cells depleted Mcl-1 and restored regorafenib
sensitivity and apoptosis induction (Fig. 3A; Fig. S3, A, C and D). In contrast to WT FBW7,
tumor-derived FBW7 mutants, including R465C, R479Q and R505C, failed to restore
regorafenib sensitivity and Mcl-1 depletion in FBW7-KO cells (Fig. 3C and S3E). FBW7
transfection also restored regorafenib sensitivity and apoptosis induction in FBW7-mutant
SW837 and SW48 cells (Fig. 3D; Fig. S3, F and G). Treating FBW7-KO and FBW7-mutant
cells with sorafenib yielded similar results (Fig. S4, A-D). In contrast to FBW7-KO and
FBW7-mutant cells, isogenic CRC cell lines with an engineered change in KRAS, BRAF,
PIK3CA, or p53 status did not show any alteration in regorafenib sensitivity compared to the
parental cells (Fig. S5, A-D), consistent with lack of correlation with the genotypes of these
genes in the cell line panel (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that regorafenib and
sorafenib sensitivity of CRC cells is dependent on FBW7, whose inactivating mutations
cause intrinsic resistance to these drugs, likely through their effect on Mcl-1 depletion.
CRC cells with acquired regorafenib resistance have FBW7 hotspot mutations

Author Manuscript

The above observations prompted us to test whether alterations in FBW7 are involved in
acquired resistance to regorafenib. We generated regorafenib-resistant cell lines using
regorafenib-sensitive and FBW7-WT cell lines, including HCT116, DLD1, SW480, RKO,
Lim1215, and Lim2405, by treating cells with 4 consecutive rounds of regorafenib. The
survival cells (-R cells) were found to be highly resistant to regorafenib, showing increased
cell viability (Fig. 4A, 4B and S6A), and higher IC50 compared to the parental cells (Table
2). The regorafenib-resistant cell lines were found to have reduced apoptosis compared to
their parental cell lines (Fig. S6B).

Author Manuscript

Remarkably, FBW7 mutations were identified in 4 out of 6 resistant cell lines, including
R505C (c.1513C>T) in HCT116-R cells, R465C (c.1393C>T) in Lim1215-R and Lim2405R cells, and R479Q (c.1436G>A) in SW480-R cells (Fig. 4C and Table 2). These mutations
account for 25%-43% of FBW7 alleles in the resistant cells, determined by sequencing of
individual clones of PCR products from genomic DNA (Fig. S6C). They are the same
hotspot mutations found in FBW7-mutant CRC cell lines and tumors (Table 1) 35. Using
allele-specific PCR assays that can detect rare FBW7 mutations in FBW7-WT cells, we
found that the R505C mutation pre-existed in ~0.03-0.1% of HCT116 cells, but became
enriched upon each successive round of regorafenib treatment (Fig. 4D). Similarly, the
R465C mutation also pre-existed in Lim1215 and Lim2405 cells and was selected by
regorafenib treatment (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the mutations, FBW7 mRNA expression,
which was elevated in the parental cells upon regorafenib treatment, could not be induced by
regorafenib in the resistant cell lines (Fig. S6D).

Mcl-1 knockdown or inhibition restores regorafenib sensitivity in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

Upon regorafenib treatment, all of the resistant cell lines showed delayed and/or attenuated
Mcl-1 degradation than the parental cell lines (Fig. 5A and Table 2), whereas other
regorafenib-induced changes, including inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of GSK3β, and induction of PUMA and other Bcl-2 family proteins 8, were
intact in the resistant cell lines (Fig. 5A and S7A), suggesting acquired regorafenib
resistance is mediated by blocked Mcl-1 degradation. Indeed, knockdown of Mcl-1 restored
regorafenib sensitivity in each of the 6 resistant lines (Fig. 5B and S7B).

Author Manuscript

Several small-molecule inhibitors of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members have been
identified, among which TW-37 was shown to be the most effective Mcl-1 inhibitor 41.
Treating cells with TW-37, but not ABT-737, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL inhibitor that does not inhibit
Mcl-1 38, restored regorafenib-induced apoptosis in regorafenib-resistant and FBW7-KO
HCT116 cells (Fig. 5C and S7C), suggesting that inhibiting Mcl-1 can overcome regorafenib
resistance in CRC cells.
Regorafenib-resistant CRC cells are cross-resistant to other agents that induce Mcl-1
degradation

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the FBW7/Mcl-1 axis has a broad functional role in drug resistance,
we analyzed the response of regorafenib-resistant cells to other anticancer agents including
targeted agents (Fig. 5D). Analysis of over 30 anticancer agents identified several additional
targeted agents that can induce Mcl-1 degradation, including the multi-kinase inhibitors
UCN-01 and Sunitinib, the CDK inhibitor Roscovitine, and the survivin inhibitor YM-155
(Fig. 5E). In response to each of these agents, apoptosis and Mcl-1 degradation were found
to be suppressed in regorafenib-resistant HCT116, SW480 and Lim 2405 cells compared to
the parental cells (Fig. 5D, 5E, S8B, and S8C). In contrast, no change was detected in the
sensitivity of regorafenib-resistant cells to the agents that did not induce Mcl-1 degradation,
including the Met/Alk inhibitor crizotinib, the death receptor ligand TRAIL, the aurora
kinase inhibitor VX680, the DNA damaging agent etoposide, the mTOR inhibitor
temsirolimous, and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide (Fig. 5D, S8B
and S8C). These results suggest that deficiency in Mcl-1 degradation, frequently caused by
FBW7 inactivating mutations, is widely involved in intrinsic and acquired resistance to
different classes of anticancer agents in CRC cells.
FBW7 and Mcl-1 depletion mediate the in vivo antitumor effects of regorafenib

Author Manuscript

To determine the role of FBW7 in mediating the in vivo effects of regorafenib, WT and
FBW7-KO HCT116 cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice to establish
xenograft tumors. Mice were then treated with 30 mg/kg regorafenib or the control vehicle
by oral gavage for 10 consecutive days. In contrast to WT tumors, FBW7-KO HCT116
tumors were substantially less sensitive to regorafenib treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). Blocked
Mcl-1 depletion but intact GSK3β de-phosphorylation was found in FBW7-KO tumors (Fig.
6C). Apoptosis analyzed by TUNEL and active caspase 3 staining was significantly reduced
in the FBW7-KO tumors compared to WT tumors (Fig. 6, D and E). Analysis of tumor
vasculature by CD31 staining showed that the antiangiogenic effect of regorafenib was
reduced in the FBW7-KO tumors (Fig. 6F). Suppression of tumor hypoxia, analyzed by

Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CA9) staining, by regorafenib was also decreased in the FBW7-KO
tumors compared to WT tumors (Fig. 6G). These findings demonstrate a pivotal role of
FBW7 and Mcl-1 degradation in mediating the antitumor effects of regorafenib.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Metastatic CRC is one of the most deadly cancers, characterized by poor prognosis and low
survival rate. Incorporation of targeted agents, including the anti-VEGF antibody
bevacizumab and the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, has improved
efficacy of CRC treatment 10. However, anticancer therapies, especially targeted therapies,
often generate highly heterogeneous patient responses. A major goal of precision medicine
is to prevent unnecessary treatments and therapy-associated adverse effects through patient
stratification. For example, KRAS status has been used to guide anti-EGFR therapy on a
CRC patient 1. Our findings elucidate a critical functional role of FBW7 and Mcl-1 in
differential sensitivity and resistance of CRC cells to targeted therapies.

Author Manuscript

Most of the FBW7 mutations in CRCs are heterozygous point mutations. It has been
controversial as to how heterozygous FBW7 mutations abolish the protein function in cancer
cells. Mutant FBW7 may have altered protein stability 28, or act as dominant negative
proteins upon hetero-dimerization with WT FBW7 12. The lower levels of FBW7 in FBW7mutant CRC cells (Fig. 1D) suggest a gene dosage effect and altered protein stability. FBW7
mutations are found in various human cancers and likely play a broad functional role in
determining therapeutic responses of cancer cells 12. They have been shown to affect
responses to γ secretase inhibitors in leukemia cells 31, 40, to HDAC inhibitors in squamous
tumor cells 21, and to antimitotic drugs in CRC cells 43. FBW7 is an F-box protein that
functions as a substrate receptor for SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF)-type of ubiquitin ligase
complexes to promote polyubiquitination 14. In addition to Mcl-1, dozens of other FBW7
substrates have been identified, including Jun, Myc, cyclin E, and Notch, which contain
CPD motifs of various binding affinities for FBW7 12. These substrates can be differentially
affected by FBW7 mutations, underlying the agent- and cell-type-dependent effects on
therapeutic response.

Author Manuscript

FBW7 determines regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity through proteasomal degradation of
Mcl-1. It has been shown that upon GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation, phosphorylated
Mcl-1 binds to FBW7 and recruited to the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex formed 43, which
can covalently link ubiquitin chains to Mcl-1, leading to its degradation in the 26S
proteasome 4. Several other kinases have also been implicated in regulating Mcl-1 turnover,
including p38, JNK, CDK1, and casein kinase II 22, 27, 43. FBW7 induction, which correlates
with Mcl-1 degradation (Fig. 3B) and is likely responsible for FBW7 activation, may be
related to transcriptional regulators of FBW7, such as microRNA 27a and C/EBPδ 2, 23.
Alternatively, the stability of FBW7 itself can be regulated by the deubiquitinase Usp28 36.
In addition to FBW7, Mcl-1 stability can be regulated by other E3 ubiquitin ligases such as
Mule and β-TrCP 16, 48, and by the deubiquitinase USP9X 37. These proteins may also be
involved in drug resistance mediated by Mcl-1 stabilization. Furthermore, a recent study
showed that Mcl-1 stability is regulated by cyclin E/cdk2-dependent phosphorylation at
specific sites, suggesting indirect regulation of Mcl-1 stability by FBW7 through cyclin E 9.

A major challenge in anticancer therapies is emergence of drug resistance. However, little is
known about why initial therapeutic responses are short lived, with re-growing tumors
insensitive to further treatment 3. Acquired resistance to the anti-EGFR therapy has been
associated with enrichment of KRAS-mutant CRC cells 15, 29, suggesting a critical role of
preexisting or de novo oncogenic mutations in acquired resistance. Our data show that
acquired regorafenib resistance can be due to enrichment of a small fraction of FBW7mutant cells (Fig. 4). The nature of genomic instability that is responsible for generating
these mutant cells remain to be identified. FBW7 genotype does not seem to be the sole
determinant of regorafenib sensitivity, suggested by residual Mcl-1 degradation in some
FBW7-mutant CRC cells (Fig. 2C) and lack of FBW7 mutations in 2 out of 6 regorafenibresistant cell lines (Table 2). Other tumor suppressors or oncogenes that regulate the
expression and protein stability of FBW7 and Mcl-1 may be involved in regorafenib and
sorafenib resistance. The role of Mcl-1 in the intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance
suggests that Mcl-1 inhibition is an effective approach for overcoming such resistance. The
cell line and resistance models generated in this study can be useful for analysis of specific
Mcl-1 targeting, which has been difficult to assess 41.

Author Manuscript

In parallel with ongoing clinical studies, our studies may establish FBW7 mutational status
and Mcl-1 stability as key determinants of regorafenib and sorafenib sensitivity. They may
provide a rationale for effective combinations of regorafenib and sorafenib with other drugs,
for establishing the broad functional roles of FBW7 and Mcl-1 in targeted anticancer
therapies, and for overcoming therapeutic resistance caused by genomic instability in cancer
cells.

All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Female 5- to 6-week-old Nu/Nu mice (Charles River) were
housed in a sterile environment with micro isolator cages and allowed access to water and
chow ad libitum. Mice were injected subcutaneously with 4×106 WT or FBW7-KO HCT116
cells. After tumor growth for 7 days, mice were treated daily with regorafenib at 30 mg/kg
by oral gavage for 10 consecutive days. Regorafenib was dissolved in Cremephor EL/95%
ethanol (50:50) as a 4× stock solution. Tumor growth was monitored by calipers, and tumor
volumes were calculated according to the formula 0.5 × length × width2. Mice were
euthanized when tumors reached 1.0 cm3 in size. Tumors were dissected and fixed in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP
