ABSTRACT
Oxymatrine, a quinolizidine natural drug extracted from Sophora japonica, has
been reported to have neuroprotective effect and cardioprotective effect. However,
the protective effect of oxymatrine on arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-induced liver injury
has not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of
oxymatrine on As2O3-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats were administrated
3mg/kg As2O3 intravenous injection on alternate days for 4 days. Oxymatrine was
given 1 h before As2O3 treatment. The results showed that oxymatrine inhibited
As2O3-induced hepatic pathological damage, liver ROS level and MDA level in a dosedependent manner. As2O3 decreased the antioxidant enzymes SOD, GPX, and CAT
activity and the decrease was inhibited by treatment of oxymatrine. Furthermore,
oxymatrine attenuated the retention of arsenic in liver tissues and improved the
expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. In conclusion, our results suggested that oxymatrine
protected against As2O3-induced oxidative damage by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
pathway.

plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant defense [9].
Once stimulation, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus to
initiate transcription of cytoprotective genes such as HO-1
[10]. Studies showed that activation of Nrf2 could protect
against arsenic trioxide-induced injury.
Oxymatrine, the major quinolizidine alkaloid
isolated from the root of Sophora flavescens Ait (kushen),
has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor,
and antioxidant effects [11, 12]. Previous reports showed
that oxymatrine exerted a protective effect on ischemia
or ischemia/reperfusion damage in liver, intestine and
heart [13, 14]. Oxymatrine has been reported to protect rat
brains against permanent focal ischemia [15]. Oxymatrine
also protected against experimental hepatic fibrosis [16].
In addition, oxymatrine was found to prevent adriamycininduced cardiac injury in rabbits, which was associated
with its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activities [17].

INTRODUCTION
Arsenic is a hazardous substance of global concern
that is present in soil, drinking water, and food [1]. Arsenic
often causes severe health hazards such as dermatosis,
diabetes, and cancers, despite of its beneficial role in the
treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [2, 3].
Studies showed that arsenic affects all organ systems of
human and liver is one of the most important target organs
for arsenic [4]. Previous reports demonstrated that arsenicinduced liver injury was closely associated with oxidative
stress [5]. Arsenic exposure has been reported to produce
reactive oxygen species and depress the antioxidant
defense system which leading to the oxidative damage of
liver tissues [6]. Recently, studies showed that antioxidants
had therapeutic effects against arsenic-induced liver injury
[7, 8]. Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that

and CAT levels by As2O3-was revised by treatment of
oxymatrine (12.5, 25, 50mg/kg).

Effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced ROS
and MDA levels

RESULTS

The effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced ROS
and MDA levels were shown in Figure 3. The results
showed that ROS and MDA levels increased significantly
in As2O3-treated group in comparison with control
group. However, the levels of ROS and MDA in As2O3 +
oxymatrine (12.5, 25, 50mg/kg) treated group decreased
significantly in comparison with As2O3-treated group.

Oxymatrine reduced As2O3-induced liver
histopathologic changes
The effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced liver
histopathologic changes were detected in this study. The
results showed that liver tissues of control and oxymatrinetreated groups showed normal lobular architecture and
cellular structure. Liver sections of As2O3-treated group
showed significant pathologic changes, such as extensive
areas of portal inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltration
and cellular necrosis. However, the pathological changes
of liver sections were attenuated in As2O3 + oxymatrine
(12.5, 25, 50mg/kg) treated group (Figure 1).

Effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced ALT and
AST levels in serum
The effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced ALT
and AST levels were shown in Figure 4. As shown in
Figure 4, the levels of ALT and AST of As2O3-treated
group increased significantly than that of control
group. However, the levels of ALT and AST in As2O3 +
oxymatrine (12.5, 25, 50mg/kg) treated group decreased
significantly in comparison with As2O3-treated group.

showed that oxymatrine exhibited protective effects on
As2O3-induced liver injury. Oxymatrine protected against
As2O3-induced liver injury through activating Nrf2
signaling pathway.
Serum AST and ALT were used as biochemical
indicator of liver injury [18, 19]. Our results showed
that the levels of AST and ALT increased significantly
in rats exposure to As2O3. Elevated levels of serum AST
and ALT in As2O3-treated rats were associated with
the extensive alterations in the pathological changes
of liver tissues. Treatment of oxymatrine remarkably
inhibited As2O3-induced AST and ALT production which
suggesting oxymatrine could attenuate liver damage.
Meanwhile, histological analysis demonstrated that
oxymatrine attenuated liver pathologic changes, including
inflammatory cell infiltration and cellular necrosis. These
results indicated oxymatrine had protective effects against
As2O3-induced liver injury.
Previous studies showed that As2O3-induced liver
injury is associated with increased oxidative stress
in liver tissues [20]. Arsenic exposure could induce

The effects of oxymatrine on Nrf2 and HO-1
expression were detected by Western blot analysis.
As shown in Figure 6, As2O3 treatment increased the
expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. However, oxymatrine (12.5,
25, 50mg/kg) up-regulated the expression of Nrf2 and
HO-1 induced by As2O3.

DISCUSSION
Oxymatrine, a quinolizidine natural drug extracted
from Sophora japonica, has been reported to have
antioxidant effect [12]. In the present study, we investigate
the protective effects of oxymatrine on As2O3-induced
toxicity in liver and oxidative stress in rats. The results

the production of ROS which played critical roles in
arsenic-induced toxicity [21, 22]. Lipid peroxidation
generates a variety of relatively stable decomposition
end-products, such as MDA, which can be measured as
indirect indicators of oxidative stress [23]. In this study,
we found that the levels of ROS and MDA in liver tissues
increased after As2O3 exposure. Treatment of oxymatrine
significantly inhibited As2O3-induced ROS and MDA
production. Arsenic-induced damage in the antioxidant
system involves several mechanisms such as altered
SOD, CAT and GPX expression [24]. In this study,
our results showed that the inhibition of SOD, GPX,
and CAT levels by As2O3-was abolished by treatment
of oxymatrine. These results indicated that oxymatrine
exhibited antioxidant effects in As2O3-induced liver
injury. Nrf-2 has been reported to play important roles in
the induction of antioxidant enzymes against oxidative
stress [25, 26]. HO-1 expression is controlled by the
transcription factor Nrf-2 [27]. Recent studies showed
that Nrf-2 signaling pathway played a protective role
in As2O3-induced liver injury [28]. Our results showed
that the increases in Nrf2 and HO-1 expression were
augmented by oxymatrine.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that
oxymatrine attenuated As2O3-induced oxidative damage in
liver tissues by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.
Oxymatrine may be an agent for preventing and treating
As2O3-induced liver injury.

A total of 72 rats were randomly divided into
six groups (n=12 each group): normal control group,
oxymatrine (50mg/kg) treatment group, As2O3 exposure
group, and As2O3 + oxymatrine (12.5, 25, 50mg/kg)
treatment group. In control group, rats were given equal
amount of 0.9% normal saline. In oxymatrine treatment
group, rats were given by an intraperitoneal injection of
oxymatrine (50mg/kg). In the As2O3 exposure group, rats
were administrated 3mg/kg As2O3 intravenous injection on
alternate days for 4 days. In As2O3 + oxymatrine treatment
group, rats were given by an intraperitoneal injection
of oxymatrine (12.5, 25, 50mg/kg) 1 h before As2O3
administered. On the 8th day, rats were killed and the
blood samples and livers from each group were collected
for various biochemical analyses.

Histological analysis
The liver tissues were collected and fixed in 10%
formalin. The liver tissues were dehydrated, embedded in
paraffin, and sliced at 4μM thickness. Then, the sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) reagent
and visualized with a microscope (Olympus, Japan).

Analysis of oxidative stress and antioxidant
defense
Liver MDA and ROS level, the antioxidant
enzymes SOD, GPX, and CAT activity were detected
by using commercial kits purchased from the Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute of Nanjing (Nanjing, Jiangsu,
China).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Oxymatrine (purity>98%) was purchased from
Beijing SL Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).
As2O3 parenteral solution (10mg/ml) was purchased from
Harbin Yida Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. (Harbin,
China). GPX, SOD, CAT, and MDA determination kits
were provided by the Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute
of Nanjing (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). Antibodies specific
for Nrf2, HO-1, Lamin B, and β-actin were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology Inc (Beverly, MA). All
other chemicals were of reagent grade.

Blood clinical analyses
Blood samples were collected and centrifuged
at 3000 g for 8 min to obtain serum. The ALT and AST
levels were measured using test kits purchased from the
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute of Nanjing (Nanjing,
Jiangsu, China).

Determination of total arsenic in the liver
The liver tissue was digested in HNO3-HCLO4
solution for 48 h at 130°C. Then the digested samples
were diluted with deionized water. The concentrations
of arsenic were detected using atomic fluorescence
spectrometry.

Animals
Seventy-two healthy male Wistar rats (110-130 g)
were purchased from the Center of Experimental Animals
of Shandong University (Shangdong, China). The rats
were housed under standard conditions (temperature,
23±2°C; humidity: 60±5%). The rats were acclimatized
to the environment for 6 days prior to the experiments.
The rats had free access to water and food. All animal
experiments carried out in this study were approved
by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
