ABSTRACT
Several chemo-resistance mechanisms including the Bcl-2 protein family
overexpression and constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling have
been documented in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), encouraging targeted
approaches to circumvent this clinical problem. Here we analyzed the activity of
the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in ALL, exploring the synergistic effects with the mTOR
inhibitor CCI-779 on ABT-737 resistant cells.We showed that a low Mcl-1/Bcl-2 plus
Bcl-xL protein ratio determined ABT-737 responsiveness. ABT-737 exposure further
decreased Mcl-1, inducing apoptosis on sensitive models and primary samples, while
not affecting resistant cells. Co-inhibition of Bcl-2 and the mTOR pathway resulted
cytotoxic on ABT-737 resistant models, by downregulating mTORC1 activity and Mcl-1
in a proteasome-independent manner. Although Mcl-1 seemed to be critical, ectopic
modulation did not correlate with apoptosis changes. Importantly, dual targeting
proved effective on ABT-737 resistant samples, showing additive/synergistic effects.
Together, our results show the efficacy of BH3 mimetics as single agent in the
majority of the ALL samples and demonstrate that resistance to ABT-737 mostly
correlated with Mcl-1 overexpression. Co-targeting of the Bcl-2 protein family and
mTOR pathway enhanced drug-induced cytotoxicity by suppressing Mcl-1, providing
a novel therapeutic approach to overcome BH3 mimetics resistance in ALL.

Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins is commonly observed in hematological
malignancies, including ALL. By blocking apoptosis
induction, Bcl-2 allows leukemic cell to survive and
proliferate irrespective of death signals that physiologically
avoid oncogenesis transformation [3–6]. Anti-apoptotic
members perform their activity by binding and sequestering
Bax and Bak, thus preventing mitochondria interaction
[7, 8]. An imbalanced expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic

INTRODUCTION
Although treatment of pediatric and Philadelphiapositive ALL patients has shown continuous progress,
adult patients, especially those characterized by
unfavorable prognostic factors, still present high rates of
relapse and develop chemo-resistance during the course
of the disease, failing to achieve further remissions and
ultimately dying [1, 2].

proteins has been documented in ALL [9] and Bax/Bcl-2
ratio has been inversely correlated to prognosis as it becomes
significantly lower at relapse [10]. Moreover, increased
expression of Bcl-2 related proteins, frequently observed
at diagnosis, is associated with decreased responsiveness
to chemotherapy induction and treatment refractoriness
[11–14]. Therefore, strategies to inhibit Bcl-2 family proteins
have been extensively investigated over the years [15–17]
showing high in vitro and in vivo efficacy.
ABT-737 is a small BH3 mimetic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
inhibitor that has demonstrated impressive pre-clinical
activity as single agent against a wide range of solid tumors
and hematological malignancies [14, 17–21]. In addition,
ABT-737 strongly synergized with chemotherapeutic drugs,
supporting its inclusion in the ALL agent armamentarium
[22, 23]. However, although ABT-737 potently binds to
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, it weakly interacts with Bfl1/A1 or Mcl-1 [16,  24]. It has been reported that high
expression of Mcl-1 significantly reduced ABT-737
cytotoxicity in several cancers, including ALL [25–28].
Moreover, cells that are initially sensitive to ABT-737 may
become resistant by upregulating Mcl-1 at transcriptional
or post-translational levels [28, 29]. Consistently, ectopic
or pharmacological modulation of Mcl-1 protein levels
restored sensitivity to ABT-737 [30, 31], thus indicating
Mcl-1 as an important determinant for ABT-737-induced
cytotoxicity.
In addition to major cytogenetic alterations, genomic
or expression profiling has recently identified the activation
of several signal transduction pathways, including
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR), Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk, Jak/STAT and
others as driving features of leukemia [32–34]. mTOR
signaling is one of the most frequently dysregulated
pathway in ALL and negatively affects patients outcome
[35–37]. mTOR is present in two distinct multi-protein
complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR
complex 2 (mTORC2) regulating the activity of p70S6K
and of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E binding
protein-1 (4EBP1) and contributing to Akt activation
by phosphorylating S473 residue, respectively [38–40].
Among its multiple functions, Akt directly influences the
transcription of Bcl-2 family genes as well as other important
regulators of apoptosis [36, 41]. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that mTOR is involved in the regulation of
Mcl-1 stability [42–44]. Indeed, by activating Akt, mTORC2
inhibits the Gsk-3 dependent phosphorylation of Mcl-1
on S159 residue, blocking its degradation via proteasome
[43, 45]. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR activity may
disrupts the balance between pro and anti-apoptotic proteins,
further enhancing leukemic cell death. In this context,
selective blockade of mTOR activity by rapamycin or its
derivatives showed to be effective in different hematological
neoplasia [46–50]. Notably, CCI-779 (Temsirolimus),
RAD001 (Everolimus) and the ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitor INK128 demonstrated anti-leukemic activity on
ALL cell lines and primary samples [50–52].

In the present study we analyzed the effects of the
BH3 mimetic ABT-737 on ALL cell lines and primary
samples, exploring the potential synergistic effects with
the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 to overcome ABT-737
acquired resistance. Moreover, we assessed the functional
response of ALL cells to the agent combination prior and
after Mcl-1 manipulation to establish its role in mediating
ABT-737 resistance.

RESULTS
ABT-737 demonstrated anti-leukemic
activity on ALL cells
To recapitulate ABT-737 effects on ALL, we initially
assessed ABT-737 cytotoxicity as a single agent on
5 human ALL cell lines, looking for a potential correlation
between drug sensitivity and Bcl-2 family members
expression. A dose-dependent apoptosis induction was
observed at increasing concentrations on the MOLT-4
and RS4;11 cell lines (IC50s: 198 and 2 nM, respectively)
whereas JURKAT, CEM R and CEM S proved resistant
(IC50s > 5 μM) (Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis revealed
that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 were heterogeneously
expressed among the cell models (Fig. 1b). Interestingly,
resistant cell lines displayed a higher Mcl-1/Bcl-2 plus
Bcl-xL protein ratio than sensitive models. Modulation of
protein expression induced by ABT-737 treatment was then
analyzed in a representative sensitive, MOLT-4, or resistant,
CEM S, cell model. ABT-737 exposure caused the cleavage
of Bcl-2 and the downregulation of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 only
in the MOLT-4 cell line, whereas their expression resulted
not affect in the resistant CEM S model (Fig. 1c).
We next evaluated the efficacy of ABT-737 on cell
growth and apoptosis induction in 9 ALL primary samples.
Treatment with increasing concentrations of ABT-737
resulted in a significant decrease of cell counts and
induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Following
24 h of exposure, subG0/G1 positive cells increased from
17.4 ± 9.3% (vehicle) to 44.2 ± 24.6% (p < 0.01) and
73.8 ± 25.3% (p < 0.001) at 10 and 100 nM, respectively
(Fig. 2a). No statistically significant correlation between
ABT-737 sensitivity and clinical features of primary
samples (age, WBC) was found. Analysis of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 protein levels on 7 evaluable samples showed
an elevated expression of Bcl-2 in all primary samples
with heterogeneous levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1
(Fig. 2a). Of note, pt #5 expressed Mcl-1 at high
levels, similar to that of CEM S cell line. According to
cell availability, we analyzed protein modulations in
3 primary specimens. Our results demonstrate that ABT737 exposure caused the appearance of cleaved Bcl-2
and induced the downregulation of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1
in two sensitive ALL samples. Conversely, pt #6 showed
unchanged levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and of Mcl-1 (Fig. 2c),
proving resistant to ABT-737 (subG0/G1 cells = 6% at

profiles previously observed on ALL cell lines, supporting
the idea that Mcl-1 plays a role in the ABT-737 resistance
also in ALL primary samples.

approach based on the simultaneous inhibition of the
Bcl-2 family proteins and the mTOR pathway activity
with ABT-737 plus CCI-779. CCI-779 concentrations were
chosen based on previous studies demonstrating the response
of ALL cell lines to this inhibitor (data not shown). As shown
in Fig. 3, neither ABT-737 nor CCI-779 as single agent
induced significant anti-proliferative or cytotoxic effects on
the JURKAT, CEM R and CEM S cell lines. By contrast,
the combination of ABT-737 and CCI-779 exhibited a
synergistic activity (CI < 0.2) on the JURKAT and CEM
R cell lines, causing a marked cell growth inhibition and
a significant (p < 0.01) apoptosis induction. However,
combined treatment did not affect the viability and apoptosis
rates of the CEM S cell line (Fig. 3). Similar results were
obtained with two additional mTOR inhibitors (RAD001
and INK128) (Fig. 4), thus confirming that there were not
off-target effects implicated in our findings.

apoptosis sensitivity. We explored a novel therapeutic

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
the synergistic interaction, we incubated JURKAT, CEM R
and CEM S cells with ABT-737 and CCI-779, alone and
in combination, and protein lysates were obtained at 3 and
24 h. Western blot analysis revealed that a 3 h CCI-779
exposure, alone and in combination with ABT-737,
induced the downregulation of the mTORC1 downstream
targets p-p70S6K(T389) and p-4EBP1(T37/46) in JURKAT
and CEM R cells, while no changes were observed in the
CEM S cell line (Fig. 5a). Moreover, a prolonged exposure
(24 h) to the inhibitors demonstrated that CCI-779,
when used in combination with ABT-737, enhanced
the dephosphorylation of Akt(S473) and consequently
of Gsk3α/β(S21/9) in comparison to single treatment,
strongly decreasing Mcl-1 expression in the JURKAT and
CEM R cell lines. The combination failed to reduce Mcl-1
levels in the CEM S cell line (Fig. 5b).

cytotoxicity induced by single or dual treatment was not
reduced in Mcl-1S159A cells compared to control cell lines
(Fig. 6c). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of
4EBP1 and subsequently of protein translation in the
JURKAT and CEM R cell lines led to the downregulation
of Mcl-1 expression explaining the ability of the ABT-737/
CCI-779 combination to trigger apoptosis in JURKAT and
CEM R cells but not in the CEM S cell line (Fig. 5b).

Combined treatment failed to show synergistic
activity where Mcl-1 is not the main
resistant factor
Since the combination of ABT-737 and CCI-779
resulted unable to reduce Mcl-1 expression in the CEM
S  cell line, we performed RNA interference of Mcl-1
(Mcl-1i). Efficient silencing was achieved without any
changes in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels (Fig. 7a).
We  then exposed wt and Mcl-1i cells to ABT-737 and
CCI-779, alone and in combination, demonstrating neither
changes in protein expression nor increase of apoptosis
in Mcl-1i CEM S cells when compared to their controls
(Fig. 7b). Only a slight reduction in cell growth was
noticed. We thus concluded that in this model Mcl-1 is not
the unique determinant of ABT-737 resistance.

Proteasome is not involved in decreasing
Mcl-1 expression
To investigate whether Mcl-1 downregulation would
be dependent on Gsk3-induced proteasomal degradation,
we treated the JURKAT and CEM R cell lines with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 prior to the addition of
ABT-737 and CCI-779 and the expression of Mcl-1 was
monitored at 16 h. No increase in Mcl-1 protein level was
observed in MG132-treated cells (Fig. 5c), thus indicating
that proteasome is not involved in Mcl-1 degradation.
To further support that Gsk3-induced Mcl-1 degradation
is not involved in ABT-737 resistance, we transfected
JURKAT and CEM R cells with a Mcl-1 protein mutant
lacking the Gsk3 phosphorylation site S159A (Mcl-1S159A)
which is known to regulate Mcl-1 stability. An efficient
transfection was achieved (Fig. 6a) and both cell lines, as
expected, showed a reduction in Mcl-1 downregulation
after treatment with ABT-737 and CCI-779, both alone
and in combination (Fig. 6b). Unexpectedly, however,

apoptosis in resistant ALL primary samples
To evaluate the effectiveness of ABT-737 and
CCI-779 as a potential therapeutic strategy in ALL,
18 additional primary samples were exposed to the drugs,
alone and in combination. As before, basal expression
levels of Bcl-2 family members was analyzed by western
blot on 10 evaluable samples. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
were heterogeneously expressed in the majority of
samples (7/10 and 9/10, respectively) and almost all
samples  (9/10) shared the overexpression of Mcl-1

when compared to NPBLs (Fig. 8a). CCI-779 treatment
as a single agent demonstrated a modest apoptosis
activity (increase of subG0/G1 peak from 19.9 ± 11.6%
(vehicle) to 23.8  ±  15.6% at 5000 nM). By contrast,
ABT-737 confirmed its cytotoxic effects also on these
samples, inducing a significant (p < 0.001) apoptosis
induction from 19.9% ± 11.6 (vehicle) to 69.9% ± 21.0
at 50 nM. Importantly, ABT-737 activity was observed
in the majority of samples (15/18) while the remaining
3 specimens exhibited less than 20% of net apoptosis
(Fig. 8b). Nevertheless, combined treatment was able to
induce synergistic (pt #10, #26) or additive (pt #17) proapoptotic effects on these 3 samples (Fig. 8b, arrows). No
significant differences in sensitivity to ABT-737 as single
agent or in combination with CCI-779 were observed when
data were sorted by age and/or WBC (data not shown).
Further analysis of correlation between ABT-737/CCI-779
sensitivity and protein expression in these three resistant
samples revealed that pt #17, which displayed additive
effects in combination, was characterized by negligible
levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with high expression of Mcl-1,
thus supporting the lower ABT-737 activity as single agent
and in combination. Conversely, pt #10 and #26, which
displayed elevated protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Mcl-1, showed a synergistic apoptosis induction associated
with a marked downregulation of p-4EBP1(T37/46) and
Mcl-1 (Fig. 8c), thus resembling the molecular changes
previously observed in the JURKAT and CEM R cell lines.

Discussion
Over the last years, attention in ALL has been
focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying drug
resistance, developing novel strategies to modulate
aberrant signaling rising from acquired lesions [53].
Among these, therapeutic targeting of the deregulated
apoptotic machinery represents an attractive area of
investigation [54, 55]. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 related
proteins allow leukemic survival and cell proliferation
by interfering with the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
Thus, inhibition of Bcl-2 family members represents a
highly potent stimulus to trigger apoptosis in leukemic
cells. ABT-737 is a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL and Bcl-w that has been investigated in several
human cancers, including hematological neoplasias.
Here we first evaluated the activity of ABT-737 as single
agent on ALL cell lines and primary samples, assessing
the correlation between Bcl-2 family member expression

expression determined in vivo sensitivity to ABT-737
in a panel of ALL xenografts from pediatric patients
[23]. Therefore, ABT-737 sensitivity in ALL seems to
depend  on several factors. We found that Mcl-1/Bcl-2
plus Bcl-xL expression ratios determined ALL cell lines
in vitro response to ABT-737. Indeed, our sensitive cell
models were characterized by lower Mcl-1 and upper
Bcl-2 plus Bcl-xL protein expression than resistant cell
lines. However, it is likely that different factors (e.g. Bim)
other than the proteins assessed in this study may affect
ABT-737 in vitro responsiveness. In agreement with
published data [57, 58], we demonstrated that increasing
concentrations of ABT-737 further decreased Bcl-xL and
Mcl-1 expression only in MOLT-4, a sensitive cell line,

and ABT-737 sensitivity. Previous reports showed that
high Bcl-2 or low Mcl-1 expression correlate with
in vitro sensitivity of several cancer cell lines to ABT-737
[24, 27, 56]. Consistently, Bcl-2 protein expression was
associated with drug efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) [25]. However, in ALL, Bcl-2 dependence rather
than basal expression seemed to have a greater impact
on cellular response [14]. Indeed, Kang and colleagues
[57] showed that levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
members are not associated with ALL susceptibility to
ABT-737. More recently, it has been demonstrated that
Mcl-1, Noxa and Bim protein levels significantly impact
on in vitro resistance of ALL cell lines. By contrast,
only Bim rather than Bax, Bak or increased Mcl-1

inducing significant cell growth reduction and apoptosis
at nanomolar concentration. By contrast, protein levels
were not affected in CEM S cells, a resistant cell model,
showing no significant changes of apoptosis induction
even at micromolar doses. Cytotoxic efficacy of ABT-737
was then confirmed on ALL primary samples, with the
majority of specimens demonstrating significant apoptosis
induction when compared to their controls. By contrast,
normal CD34+ cells were remarkably resistant to ABT737, as already shown by Konopleva et al. [25],
Interestingly, we found a resistant primary sample
in which Mcl-1 expression was not affected by ABT737 exposure. Conversely, analysis of two sensitive
ALL samples revealed a marked Mcl-1 downregulation
following ABT-737 exposure, likely due to apoptosis
induction. These results, in accordance to published data
[56], support the contribution of Mcl-1 downregulation in
the ABT-737-induced cytotoxicity.
To overcome BH3 mimetics resistance, we explored
a novel therapeutic approach by using the mTOR inhibitor
CCI-779 in ALL cell lines and primary samples. The
PI3K/mTOR pathway is frequently found constitutively
activated in ALL [35, 36, 59] and targeted inhibition
of mTOR, alone or in association with PI3K, has been
investigated at multiple levels, generally displaying
better results in vitro than in vivo. Recently, it has been
demonstrated that activated Akt may decrease ABT-737
activity, suggesting a functional role of this signaling also
in protecting leukemia cells from BH3 mimetic-induced
apoptosis [60]. Consistently, simultaneous inhibition of
the PI3K/mTOR pathway, by BEZ235, and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL,
by ABT-737, strongly potentiated cytotoxicity of single
agents and markedly reduced colony formation in multiple
AML cell lines and primary blast specimens while exerted
only modest toxicity toward normal hematopoietic
progenitors [60]. Moreover, Jin and colleagues [61]
showed that the combination of GDC-0941 and ABT-737
triggered mitochondrial apoptosis in AML cells co-cultured
with stromal cells under hypoxic conditions, thus
suggesting the efficacy of this approach even under
the protective conditions afforded by the bone marrow
microenvironment. It has also been demonstrated that
PI3K/mTOR signaling contributed to ABT-737 resistance
in Burkitt lymphoma cells, and their inhibition through
dual or active site mTOR inhibitors induced synergistic
caspase activation, rendering chemoresistant cells
sensitive to apoptosis induction [62]. In addition, data
obtained on different solid tumors [31, 63, 64] showed that
blockade of mTOR signaling and Bcl-2 activity triggered
massive in vitro apoptosis by loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, activation of caspases and Mcl1 downregulation and was highly synergistic in vivo
providing tumor regressions without notable hematologic
suppression. Since numerous of the aforementioned
inhibitors have shown promising results in different
stages of clinical trials, alone or in combination with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy [clinicaltrials.gov], it has been proposed
that the simultaneous inhibition of the mTOR pathway
and Bcl-2 activity in cancer cells, even in those resistant
to single agents, may have important clinical implications.
We found that CCI-779, RAD001 and INK128, as single
agents, modestly impaired resistant cell line proliferation,
resulting in a no significant pro-apoptotic activity. By
contrast, co-targeting of Bcl-2 and mTOR activity with all
the above inhibitors strongly sensitized resistant JURKAT
and CEM R cell lines to apoptosis, thus reverting the
acquired ABT-737 resistance. Interestingly, since CEM
R cells are known to be insensitive to vinblastine [65],
we hypothesized that combined treatment can be effective
also in other chemoresistant models even those MDR1related. However, the CEM S cell line failed to show
any apoptotic increase after exposure to all tested
combination, suggesting an analysis of protein expression
to better understand the biological reasons underlying
synergistic interaction between the aforementioned drugs.
We observed that CCI-779, especially when in combination
with ABT-737, inhibited the mTORC1 pathway activity by
decreasing phosphorylation levels of p70S6K and 4EBP1
only in JURKAT and CEM R, thus reinforcing the idea
of a context-dependent role of mTORC1 in the increased
ABT-737-mediated cell death [31]. Moreover, after 24 h of
treatment, CCI-779 also affected the mTORC2 pathway,
as demonstrated by the downregulation of p-Akt(S473)
and p-Gsk3α/β(S21/9), indicating that prolonged exposure
to rapamycin derivative may be effective, at least in part,
also on PI3K downstream targets. Of note, combined
treatment markedly decreased Mcl-1 protein levels in the
JURKAT and CEM R cell lines, while not affecting its
expression in CEM S cells. We excluded the involvement
of proteasomal degradation in ABT-737-induced Mcl1 downregulation since protein levels appeared not
increased in cells treated with MG132, a well-known
proteasome inhibitor, compared to their controls. We also
transfected a mutant of Mcl-1 which lacks the S159
residue, a known Gsk3 phosphorylation site that marks
Mcl-1 for proteasomal degradation, in the JURKAT and
CEM R cell lines. Although an efficient transfection was
achieved and both cell lines showed a reduction in Mcl-1
downregulation, we unexpectedly detected no reduction
in apoptosis induction after single or combined treatment,
further supporting the idea that proteasomal degradation
is not involved in Mcl-1 degradation. These finding led us
to hypothesize that inhibition of 4EBP1-dependent protein
translation may be important for the synergistic interaction
between ABT-737 and CCI-779. Further experiments are
needed to clarify unequivocally the precise contribution of
molecular mechanisms (e.g. caspase-dependent cleavage)
in determining Mcl-1 levels on ALL cells.
However, our results demonstrated that in some model,
as the CEM S cell line, Mcl-1 is not a unique determinant
of ABT-737 resistance. Indeed, when we knocked down
protein expression by RNA interference, we observed no
32097

changes in treatment cytotoxicity, even after exposure to
the combination. Different groups have already reported
that, in certain contexts, Mcl-1 downregulation although
required is incapable itself of initiating apoptosis [66, 67].
In addition, loss of Bim, combined absence of Bax and Bak
or overexpression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-w have been shown to
make lymphoma cells resistant to ABT-737 in vitro and in
vivo, even in the absence of endogenous Mcl-1 [68], thus
indicating that targeting of more than one antiapoptotic
protein may be required for the full engagement of the
apoptotic machinery. Therefore, we concluded that Mcl-1
downregulation likely cooperates with other independent
mechanisms to support ABT-737 resistance in ALL.
The effectiveness of the ABT-737 and CCI-779
combination as a novel therapeutic strategy was further
evaluated on additional primary ALL samples. CCI-779
treatment as monotherapy demonstrated only a modest
apoptosis activity on these samples, whereas ABT-737
confirmed its cytotoxic effects inducing significant apoptosis
increase on the large majority of samples. Importantly,
combined treatment was able to sensitize ABT-737
resistant samples to apoptosis in an additive or synergistic
fashion, thus overcoming the acquired resistance to ABT737. Of note, analysis of protein expression revealed that
samples that displayed additive effects in combination were
characterized by negligible levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with
high expression of Mcl-1, supporting lower drug activities.
Conversely, the other ABT-737 resistant samples displayed
elevated protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, showing
a synergistic apoptosis induction after combined treatment
associated with a marked downregulation of Mcl-1.
However we cannot exclude the existence of primary
samples that exhibit a resistance phenotype as the CEM S
cell line (i.e. not dependent only from Mcl-1).
In conclusion, our study show the efficacy of BH3
mimetics as single agent in the majority of the ALL
samples and demonstrate that Mcl-1 represents the main
resistance factor to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in ALL
cell lines and primary samples. Co-targeting of the Bcl-2
family proteins and mTOR pathway effectively enhanced
single drug cytotoxicity by downregulating mTORC1
activity and Mcl-1 expression. Additional resistant
mechanisms, however, should be taken into account
since, in certain ALL models, Mcl-1 modulation failed to
overcome by itself ABT-737 resistance, thus suggesting
the existence of other mechanisms of resistance to BH3
mimetics.

the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Sapienza University of Rome and
normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (NPBLs) were
purified by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA)
density-gradient centrifugation. Only specimens with
blast counts > 70% were included in this study. For
in vitro treatments, ABT-737 (kindly provided by Abbott
Laboratories) and CCI-779 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland)
were prepared in DMSO and ethanol to a stock
concentration of 10 and 20 mM, respectively. RAD001
(Sigma-Aldrich) and INK128 (Selleckchem, Germany)
were both diluted in DMSO to a stock concentration of
10 mM. ALL cell lines (MOLT4, RS4;11, JURKAT,
CEM R and CEM S) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Euroclone, Milan, Italy) containing 10% heat inactivated
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine and antibiotics
at 37°C under 5% CO2 - 95% air and harvested in logphase growth. For each experiment, cell lines and primary
samples were plated at concentration of 0.2 × 106/mL
and 1 × 106/mL, respectively. Viability was assessed by
triplicate Trypan blue exclusion counting. To establish
the optimal concentration for drug treatment, MTT
[3–4,5-dimethylthythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assays (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed. Cell
lines and primary samples were incubated up to 72 h with
ABT-737 (ranging from 10 to 5000 nM), CCI-779 (10 to
20000 nM), RAD001 (500 to 10000 nM) and INK128
(1 to 500 nM) alone and in combination. For proteasome
inhibition, 3 μM of MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added
to the medium 3 h before drugs administration.

Apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed by Acridine
Orange technique, as previously described [69]. To
evaluate apoptosis levels, cells were examined over a
culture period of 24–72 h using Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, as
previously described [70]. Apoptosis induction was further
measured by evaluating the subG0/G1 peak using AO
technique, as described [71]. Flow cytometric analyses
were carried out using both FACSCan and Accuri C6 flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Cytotoxic activity
induced by in vitro treatments was evaluate by measuring
the net apoptosis rate obtained from the difference between
subG0/G1 value of each condition and of that of controls.
