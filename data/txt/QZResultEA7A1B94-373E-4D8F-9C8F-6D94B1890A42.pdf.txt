Reply to Direct-Acting Antiviral
Drugs and Hepatitis C Virus: A
Therapeutic Revolution?
We appreciate Dr. Braillon’s interest in our recent review.1
We agree that the high upfront costs of direct-acting antivirals have proved to be a major challenge for payers. However, a number of independent studies have demonstrated
that all-oral DAA regimens, even at their wholesale prices,
are cost-effective under most circumstances. Although this
is particularly true among patients with advanced disease,

cost-effectiveness was still observed among patients with
low fibrosis stages in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV).2-4
Although there have been price reductions for these regimens as a result of discounting, our current challenge
remains the development of multistakeholder solutions to
maximize access to these regimens.
We disagree that a sustained virologic response (SVR)
accomplished with direct-acting antivirals should be biologically distinct from one achieved with interferon-based
regimens, as Dr. Braillon suggests. The eradication of a
chronic viral infection that is a known driver of hepatocarcinogenesis should confer the same benefits, no matter the
method through which it is achieved. Postmarketing studies will settle this issue in the coming years but the message
is already clear: interferon-free regimens that enhance effectiveness by combining high efficacy and tolerability will
remain the standard of care for the treatment of patients
with HCV.
We agree that the comprehensive care of all patients
with HCV should certainly include the treatment of
comorbid factors, including alcohol use, obesity, and
tobacco use, as Dr. Braillon suggests. However, screening
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should also be part of
this multimodal care, and is endorsed by all professional
liver disease societies. This practice also should extend to
those patients with advanced fibrosis who have achieved
SVR, as we discuss in our article,1 because, although the
downstream risk of HCC is significantly reduced, there still
remains a residual risk of the disease. Although to our
knowledge there are few data regarding the true effectiveness of HCC screening, a recent meta-analysis found that
HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved
early-stage detection (odds ratio [OR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.80-2.37), curative treatment
rates (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.99-2.52), and prolonged survival (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.67-2.17), even in studies
adjusted for lead time bias.5 It is also important to emphasize that a prerequisite for effective screening is the identification of an appropriate population, an area that should be
actively investigated as SVR becomes more frequent. As
such, further studies need to be performed that identify
those individuals achieving SVR who remain at highest risk
of developing HCC to select those who would most benefit
from screening.
Finally, we strongly disagree with Dr. Braillon’s
assessment that the HCV epidemic should disappear with
preventive measures alone. On the contrary, recent evidence depicts an HCV epidemic that continues to spread.

heroin use in the setting of growing prescription opioid dependence. Significant spikes in HCV infection within this
population in Appalachia, the Northeast, and the Midwest
have been described within the last several years.6-8 The
HCV epidemic continues to evolve, presenting novel challenges to outreach, education, and treatment efforts in
high-risk groups. In this context, the unprecedented ability
to eliminate HCV and prevent most of its complications
can hardly be construed as “sciensationalism.”
