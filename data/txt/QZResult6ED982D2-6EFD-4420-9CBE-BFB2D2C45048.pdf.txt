Abstract

Author Manuscript

CD95 (also called Fas and APO-1) is a prototypical death receptor that regulates tissue
homeostasis mainly in the immune system through induction of apoptosis 1-3. During cancer
progression CD95 is frequently downregulated or cells are rendered apoptosis resistant 4,5 raising
the possibility that loss of CD95 is part of a mechanism for tumour evasion. However, complete
loss of CD95 is rarely seen in human cancers 4 and many cancer cells express large quantities of
CD95 and are highly sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, cancer patients
frequently have elevated levels of the physiological ligand for CD95, CD95L 6. These data raise
the intriguing possibility that CD95 could actually promote the growth of tumours through its
nonapoptotic activities 7. Here we show that cancer cells in general, regardless of their CD95
apoptosis sensitivity, depend on constitutive activity of CD95, stimulated by cancer-produced
CD95L, for optimal growth. Consistently, loss of CD95 in mouse models of ovarian cancer and
liver cancer reduces cancer incidence as well as the size of the tumours. The tumorigenic activity
of CD95 is mediated by a pathway involving JNK and c-Jun. These results demonstrate that CD95
plays a growth promoting role during tumorigenesis and suggest that efforts to inhibit its activity
rather than to enhance its activation should be considered during cancer therapy.
To test the function of endogenous CD95 in tumour cells, expression of CD95 was reduced
in various human cancer cell lines using CD95 specific shRNA lentiviruses (Supplementary

Fig. 1). Infection of the CD95 high expressing ovarian cancer cell line HeyA8, which in
vitro is sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis, with a lentiviral shRNA against CD95 (R#6)
substantially reduced CD95 protein and surface expression resulting in loss of CD95
apoptosis sensitivity (Fig. 1a). Abrogation of CD95 expression also resulted in substantial
growth reduction. This was confirmed with another CD95 targeting shRNA (R#4)
(Supplementary Fig. 2) and in another ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV3ip1, which expresses
very low amounts of CD95 and is completely resistant to CD95L induced apoptosis (Fig. 1b
and data not shown). Reconstitution of the SKOV3ip1 CD95 knock down cells with an
siRNA resistant version of CD95 to endogenous levels restored the growth of SKOV3ip1
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). A growth inhibiting effect of reducing CD95 expression was
also found in cell lines derived from colon (HCT116), renal (CAKI-1), breast (MCF7), and
liver (HepG2) cancer (Fig. 1c-f). Knocking down CD95 in MCF7 cells with the R#6 virus
resulted, 6 days after infection, in growth arrest (data not shown). However, 3 weeks after
infection cells expressing intermediate CD95 levels grew out, albeit with reduced growth as
compared to vector control infected cells (Fig. 1e). Neither MCF7 nor CAKI-1 cells
benefited from overexpressing CD95 (Supplementary Fig. 4) suggesting that cancer cells,
regardless of the absolute level of CD95 expression, maintain expression of CD95 at a level
sufficient to promote optimal growth. This is consistent with our previous report that in 22
tumour cell lines stimulation of CD95 did not result in increased proliferation 6. However,
incubating cells with the neutralising CD95L monoclonal antibody (mAb), NOK-1, reduced
cell growth (Supplementary Fig. 5a) suggesting that the small amount of CD95L produced
by tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b) contributes to their growth. To directly test this
assumption we used lentivirus based shRNAs specific for CD95L which knocked down
CD95L in a murine cell line expressing full length human CD95L (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
We monitored growth of HepG2 cells infected with each of three independent CD95L
specific shRNA viruses all of which caused reduction of CD95L expression (Fig. 1g).
Paralleling the efficiency of the knock down the viruses caused different degrees of growth
inhibition ranging from a reduction in growth (L#2) to a complete loss of growth (L#1) (Fig.
1h). Knocking down CD95L using an siRNA SmartPool (Supplementary Fig. 5c) also
resulted in profound growth inhibition of HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Finally,
knocking down CD95L also reduced growth of all other cancer cell lines suggesting that
CD95L is essential for the growth of many tumour cells (Fig. 1i). The knock down of CD95
in HepG2 only caused a moderate reduction in growth, possibly because this knock down
may not have been efficient enough to cause a more pronounced effect. Given the small
amount of CD95L expressed in tumour cells, reducing its expression is more likely to cause
severe effects by falling below a threshold of minimal expression. This interpretation is
consistent with a recent analysis that determined that the threshold for CD95 to signal
apoptosis versus nonapoptotic signalling is 1000 times higher 8. Our data suggest that
almost undetectable amounts of CD95 and CD95L are sufficient and in some cases required
to promote growth of tumour cells.
CD95 is highly expressed in epithelial ovarian cancer but these cancer cells acquire
resistance to CD95 mediated apoptosis 9. Large quantities of CD95L are found in patient
ascites 10,11 and patient serum 12. As a first step toward understanding the role of CD95 in
ovarian cancer in vivo we employed an intraperitoneal xenograft model of metastatic ovarian

cancer 13. Nude mice injected with SKOV3ip1 cells infected with either the R#6 (Fig. 2a) or
the R#4 (Fig. 2b) virus had about a 50% reduction in tumour mass, number of metastases
and ascites formation. To test whether in vivo CD95 dependent tumour growth was driven
by CD95L, SKOV3ip1 cells were grown for one week in nude mice and then treated with
either a neutralising anti-CD95L mAb specific for mouse CD95L (MFL3) or for human
CD95L (NOK-1). Tumour growth was attenuated only in mice injected with the human
CD95L specific antibody (Fig. 2d) suggesting that it is predominantly the CD95L produced
by the human cancer cells (see insert in Fig. 2d), rather than CD95L produced by the
microenvironment in the mouse host, that drives CD95-mediated tumour growth.

To test whether the growth promoting role of CD95 could also be found in actual ovarian
cancer we used a primary ovarian cancer cell line (MONTY-1 14) at an early passage
number. CD95 was knocked down in MONTY-1 cells (again resulting in reduced
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 6)) after which these cells were injected into nude mice.
Similar to findings with SKOV3ip1 cells, MONTY-1 cells with reduced CD95 expression
were completely resistant to CD95 mediated apoptosis and showed reduced intra-abdominal
tumour load (Fig. 2e). Also, similar to findings with SKOV3ip1 cells (Fig. 2c) this result
could, at least in part, be explained by a reduced proliferation rate (reduced Ki-67 staining)
and reduced vascularization (reduced CD31 staining). The tumours showed an increase in
TUNEL staining suggesting that the inhibition of the growth promoting CD95 receptor
caused cancer cells to die (Fig. 2f).

Similar to other subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers 9, the endometrioid subtype expresses
CD95 (Fig. 3a) suggesting that in ovarian cancer CD95 could promote tumorigenesis. To
test this we used a genetic model of epithelial endometrioid ovarian cancer based on the
expression of activated mutant K-ras and deletion of Pten 15. For these studies we generated
K-ras/Pten mutant mice carrying loxP sites in the CD95 gene 16 (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Cancer formation was initiated by injecting Adenovirus (AdV) Cre into the right ovarian
bursa of the mice. Eight weeks after injection 9 out of 12 mice expressing wt CD95 had
formed an ovarian cancer in the injected ovary with no cancer in the uninjected control
ovary while only one of the 11 mice with knocked out CD95 had an early cancer (Fig. 3b-d).
While wt mice started to die 8-9 weeks after AdV Cre injection in this model, only one of 4
mice lacking CD95 in the ovaries had an early cancer after 14 weeks. IHC confirmed that
CD95 was highly expressed in the cancerous ovaries of wt mice and efficiently knocked out
in the AdV-Cre injected ovaries of mice carrying the floxed CD95 alleles (Fig. 3d). PCR
analysis to detect deleted pten confirmed that the Cre recombinase was equally active in
cells of either genotype (Supplementary Fig. 7c). In summary, the data suggest that CD95
plays a role in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer.

Liver is the tissue with the highest constitutive CD95 expression. It was previously shown
that mice expressing an apoptosis signalling deficient mutant of CD95 have a defect in liver
regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) 17 raising the possibility that CD95 is involved
in liver regeneration. To determine if it is CD95 expressed on hepatocytes that drives their
proliferation, we generated hepatocyte-specific CD95 knock out mice by crossing CD95
loxP mice with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under control of the liver specific
albumin promoter (Alb-Cre mice) (Supplementary Fig. 8). These mutant mice were then

subjected to 2/3 PH. Proliferation of hepatocytes was severely impaired 48 hrs after PH in
the absence of CD95 on hepatocytes (Fig. 4a,b) confirming that CD95 expression on
hepatocytes is required for their proliferation. This raised a possibility that CD95 might also
promote liver cancer.

Author Manuscript

Prolonged damage to the liver accompanied by compensatory hepatocyte proliferation can
promote hepatocarcinogenesis 18 which can be recapitulated in a mouse model of
diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As compared to wt
mice, mice lacking expression of CD95 in the liver showed a clear reduction of HCC 8
months following a single injection of DEN (Fig. 4c). These data suggest that CD95
contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis. Ki-67 staining in the tumours of CD95 deficient livers
was reduced (Fig. 4d,e), consistent with a contribution of CD95 to the growth of liver
cancer. Because it was previously shown that expression of Cre recombinase can affect the
apoptosis sensitivity of certain tissues 19, we confirmed our data in Cre expressing mice of a
different genotype (Supplementary Fig. 9). DEN has been described to induce liver damage
through a mechanism that involves ROS 18. Consistently, reduction of HCC in mice lacking
CD95 expression in the liver was not due to a decrease in DEN induced damage because
injection of DEN into 15 day old or adult wt or CD95 k.o. mice did not induce significantly
increased apoptosis and caused a similar activation of JNK (Supplementary Fig. 10).
However, the proliferative response (Ki-67 staining) of hepatocytes in DEN injected mice
was strongly reduced in CD95 deficient livers (Supplementary Fig. 10a). In summary, our
data support a role of CD95 in liver regeneration that translates into an increase in
hepatocarcinogenesis in a chemically induced model of liver cancer.

JNK1 deficient mice have a reduced ability to recover from PH and are less susceptible to
DEN induced liver cancer 20,21. Recently this link between JNK1 activation and HCC was
confirmed in human HCC by two independent studies. HCC patients showed an increased
activation of JNK1 in the cancer cells when compared to adjacent noncancerous tissue
20,22. Consistent with a function of JNK in proliferation of tumour cells we found that
treatment of tumour cell lines with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 completely inhibited their
growth (Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Results). Strikingly, hepatocytes from
CD95 deficient mice showed reduced phosphorylation of JNK and the JNK substrate c-Jun
(Fig. 4f) suggesting that loss of CD95 reduced the basal activity of JNK resulting in loss of
proliferative capacity. To test whether stimulation of CD95 in the liver causes activation of
JNK we injected wt mice with the agonistic anti-CD95 mAb, Jo2. Injection of Jo2 caused a
massive increase in the phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun both in mice that possessed an
intact liver (these mice died when injected with Jo2) and in mice subjected to PH (known to
protect mice from liver death 17, as evidenced by a lack of caspase-3 cleavage, TUNEL
staining and increase in liver enzyme ALT) (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 12a). A clear
increase in intracellular p-c-Jun staining of hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 12b) indicated
that JNK was activated in hepatocytes in response to CD95 stimulation in mice protected
from apoptosis by PH. The link between CD95 and the JNK pathway was also found in
endometrioid tumours from K-ras/Pten mutant mice. Tumour tissue taken from cancerous
ovaries expressing CD95 stained strongly for both CD95 and nuclear p-c-Jun, whereas

tumour tissue from mice deficient for CD95 expression in the ovaries not only lacked
expression of CD95, but was also devoid of p-c-Jun staining (Fig. 4h).

Author Manuscript

In aggregate the data suggest that cancer cells and the regenerating liver require a basal
activity of CD95 to activate JNK resulting in phosphorylation of c-Jun and driving
proliferation. To identify further downstream effectors in this pathway we isolated RNA
from HeyA8 cells with knocked down CD95 using two independent shRNAs, and from
HepG2 cells with knocked down CD95, and from CD95 deficient livers and compared gene
expression profiles to the corresponding parental/wt cells. Interestingly, among all three
systems, there were only two genes that were downregulated to a greater extent than CD95
itself—early growth 1 (Egr1) and the AP1 component c-Fos (Supplementary Fig. 13a-c).
Both genes are downstream of JNK and are essential growth promoting transcription factors
23,24. Consistent with their function, both Egr1 and c-Fos were strongly upregulated in the
liver of Jo2-injected, partial hepatectomised mice (Supplementary Fig. 13d) and their
expression was strongly reduced in CD95 deficient ovarian cancer (Supplementary Fig.
13e).

Author Manuscript

Our data suggest that the CD95/CD95L system, rather than acting tumour suppressive,
drives cancer growth joining the ranks of the TNFR1 and TNFα in stimulating tumour
growth. In line with our results, studies suggest that CD95 activates neuronal stem cells 25
and acts as a tumour promoter for glioblastoma by activating src kinases 26. In addition it
was recently shown that mice that only express soluble CD95L suffer from large histiocytic
sarcomas in the liver 27 likely due to a lack of apoptosis induction and a tumorigenic
activity of CD95L. Our data suggest that CD95 exerts a growth promoting activity mainly
through a pathway involving JNK, c-Jun, Erg1 and c-Fos, and that tumour cells are
stimulated by their own CD95L. The data provide an explanation for the long standing
mystery of the role of CD95 expression in many tissues and in the majority of human
cancers without signs of apoptosis in vivo, and suggest that efforts to inhibit rather than to
promote CD95 activity should be considered during cancer therapy.

Methods Summary
Endometrioid ovarian cancer induction

Author Manuscript

The method of ovarian cancer induction using LSL-K-rasG12D/+PtenloxP/loxP and LSL-KrasG12D/+PtenloxP/loxPCD95loxP/loxP female mice was described previously 28. Briefly, mice
were sedated, the right ovary was exposed and the ovarian bursa was injected with AdCre
(2.5 × 107 plaque-forming units) (University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core). The left
ovary was not injected and served as an internal control. Mice were evaluated weekly for
palpable tumour and all were sacrificed 8 or 14 weeks after the injection of the virus. At the
time of sacrifice the primary tumour was excised, weighed, measured and the number of
metastatic nodules and volume of ascites were recorded. All tissue was fixed in 10%
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.
Partial hepatectomy
2/3 partial hepatectomy was performed as previously described 29,30. In brief, mice were
anaesthetised with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) i.p., the liver was

exposed through a midline incision, and the right and left lobes were sequentially ligated
with a silk 4-0 suture, and resected. BrdU solution (50 mg/kg in PBS) was injected i.p. 2 hrs
prior to analysis. DNA synthesis was measured by immunohistochemical staining of
paraffin liver sections with anti-BrdU antibody. The percentage of BrdU positive hepatocyte
nuclei among total hepatocyte nuclei was calculated using the Cellular Image Analysis
System (ACIS, Clarient, San Juan Capistrano, CA).
Liver cancer induction
15 day old CD95loxP/loxP (wt) and CD95loxP/loxPAlbumin-Cre (CD95 k.o.) male mice were
injected with a single dose of DEN (25 μg/g body weight, i.p.). Eight months later, all mice
were sacrificed and livers were excised. Parameters of total liver weight, number of liver
surface nodules and maximum nodule diameters were recorded.

Figure 4. Deletion of CD95 in the liver leads to a decrease in tumour formation caused by
reduced ability of hepatocytes to proliferate and to activate JNK

Author Manuscript

a, H&E and BrdU staining of livers from wild-type (wt) and liver specific CD95 k.o. mice
48 hrs after partial hepatectomy. Scale bars = 100 μm. b, Quantification of relative BrdU
staining intensity of the mice in (a). c, wt and liver specific CD95 k.o. mice were injected
with a single dose of DEN i.p. to induce liver tumour formation. 8 months later, all mice
were sacrificed and parameters of total liver weight, number of liver surface nodules and
maximum nodule diameter were recorded. d, Intact livers (scale bar = 1 cm), H&E staining
and immunohistochemistry of TUNEL, Ki-67 and CD31 from mice in (c). Scale bar = 100
μm. e, Quantification of Ki-67 and CD31 staining for liver samples in (d). There was no
detectable TUNEL staining. f, Western blot for phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun in three
untreated wt and three CD95 k.o. mouse livers. g, wt mice with or without PH were injected
i.p with 10 μg of murine CD95-specific agonistic antibody, Jo2 or isotype matched control
mAb. After 6 hours phospho-JNK, p-c-Jun levels and cleavage of caspase-3 in livers were
