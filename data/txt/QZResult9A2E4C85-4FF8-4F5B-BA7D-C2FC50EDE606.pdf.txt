ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carrying specific EGFR kinase
activating mutations (L858R, delE746-A750) respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs). However, drug resistance develops within a year. In about 50% of such
patients, acquired drug resistance is attributed to the enrichment of a constitutively
active point mutation within the EGFR kinase domain (T790M). To date, differential
drug-binding and altered ATP affinities by EGFR mutants have been shown to be
responsible for differential TKI response. As it has been reported that EGFR stability
plays a role in the survival of EGFR driven cancers, we hypothesized that differential
TKI-induced receptor degradation between the sensitive L858R and delE746-A750
and the resistant T790M may also play a role in drug responsiveness. To explore this,
we have utilized an EGFR-null CHO overexpression system as well as NSCLC cell lines
expressing various EGFR mutants and determined the effects of erlotinib treatment.
We found that erlotinib inhibits EGFR phosphorylation in both TKI sensitive and
resistant cells, but the protein half-lives of L858R and delE746-A750 were significantly
shorter than L858R/T790M. Third generation EGFR kinase inhibitor (AZD9291) inhibits
the growth of L858R/T790M-EGFR driven cells and also induces EGFR degradation.
Erlotinib treatment induced polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, primarily
in a c-CBL-independent manner, in TKI sensitive L858R and delE746-A750 mutants
when compared to the L858R/T790M mutant, which correlated with drug sensitivity.
These data suggest an additional mechanism of TKI resistance, and we postulate
that agents that degrade L858R/T790M-EGFR protein may overcome TKI resistance.

somatic mutations in EGFR are prevalent in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients [2]. There are two
activating mutations of the EGFR gene that together
constitute about 90% of all EGFR activating mutations:
in-frame deletions in exon 19 (delE746-A750) and a
point mutation in exon 21 that substitutes an arginine
for a leucine at codon 858 (L858R). In addition to these
frequent mutations about 5% of lung cancer patient

INTRODUCTION
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) regulates major
developmental and metabolic processes. The kinase
activity of EGFR is often dysregulated in tumor cells, and
its aberrant activation can lead to enhanced cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [1]. Activating

tumors contain an insertion in exon 20 between amino
acids 767 to 774 [3]. These activating mutations lead to
an equilibrium shift with ATP that favors the activated TK
state leading to an increase in kinase activity, and, thus,
the tumor cells displaying these mutations have growth
and survival advantages [4]. Although the EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) have shown activity in NSCLC,
acquired resistance to these agents ultimately leads to
disease progression within a year. In approximately half of
these cases, resistance is due to the occurrence of a point
mutation in EGFR Exon 20 (T790M) [5]. This threonine
at residue 790 is considered the gatekeeper residue which
controls ATP recruitment by the kinase domain of EGFR.
Current studies suggest two potential mechanisms
by which cells acquire TKI resistance. The first is
that the T790M mutant has about 10 to 15 fold higher
affinity towards ATP when compared to activating EGFR
mutants. Thus, TKIs cannot displace ATP as efficiently
as they can in the case of L858R-EGFR where ATP
binding is relatively weaker [6]. The second hypothesis
is that replacement of threonine by bulkier methionine
causes steric hindrance which limits the binding of TKIs
with the EGFR kinase domain [7]. However, it remains
possible that there are other mechanisms of acquired
TKI resistance. For example, with regard to the first
mechanism, it is known that the Km values for ATP binding
of wild-type and TKI resistant T790M-EGFR are similar
[6, 8], but they respond differently to TKI treatment. The
second hypothesis, related to limited binding with TKI
when threonine is replaced with bulkier methionine, is
also attractive, but several biochemical and structural
studies suggested that M790 may not sterically impede
most “quinazoline” inhibitors from binding [6] (PDB
4LL0). Furthermore, irreversible inhibitors bind to the
double mutants (L858R with T790M) with only slightly
diminished affinity compared to wild-type enzyme [9],
or, with greater affinity as seen with the bulky inhibitor
Neratinib, which was found to have a Ki 50-fold more
potent for L858R/T790M EGFR than for wild-type EGFR
[10]. This finding is supported by recent data that show
“mutant-selective” irreversible TKIs such as AZD9291
have similar inhibitory potency for L858R/T790M to the
first generation of TKI’s but reduced affinity for wild-type
EGFR [11].
Therefore, although the clinical observation
correlating EGFR mutations with the response has long
been established, the precise mechanism(s) of sensitivity
or resistance to TKI still remain unclear. We and others
have noted that EGFR degradation upon gemcitabine,
cisplatin or radiation increases tumor cell-specific
cytotoxicity beyond that of EGFR inhibition alone [1219], and TKI-resistant cells are responsive to therapies
that induce EGFR degradation [19-22]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that differential EGFR degradation may
contribute to the difference in sensitivity to TKIs observed
in patients harboring L858R as compared to those who

co-harbor T790M. EGFR protein degradation upon ligand
(EGF) binding is well established, where c-CBL ubiquitin
ligase is implicated in phospho-EGFR polyubiquitination
and lysosomal degradation. However, the involvement
of c-CBL in erlotinib-induced receptor degradation of
inactive receptor remain unknown.
To test our hypothesis, we characterized the effect
of erlotinib on EGFR protein stability in cells harboring
drug sensitive or resistant mutations frequently observed
in patients within the kinase domain. For the mechanistic
studies, we constructed YFP fusion constructs with the
L858R mutation, the L858R/T790M double mutant,
and wild-type full-length EGFR (as control). We used
EGFR-null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to
overexpress individual EGFR constructs and visualized
EGFR expression and monitored changes in their steady
state levels and localization upon erlotinib treatment.
Additionally, we utilized NSCLC and HNSCC cell
lines expressing endogenous mutant EGFR proteins to
study the effect of erlotinib on EGFR protein half-lives.
The mechanistic role of c-CBL in erlotinib mediated
EGFR degradation was also determined. Finally, using
a genetically modified sub-line of NCI-H1975 cells, we
conducted in vivo experiments and imaged EGFR activity
in real-time using a non-invasive bioluminescence reporter
and also assessed the effect of treatment on tumor growth.
In this model, we found that, although erlotinib blocked
EGFR activity, tumor growth was not affected. These
findings suggest that EGFR protein stability, not just its
activity plays an important role in erlotinib response.

RESULTS
Erlotinib treatment induces rapid downregulation
of L858R-YFP protein following intracellular
aggregation in CHO cells
To study the effect of erlotinib on different EGFR
mutants, we used a transient transfection system using
CHO cells, which do not express endogenous EGFR. We
constructed and sequence verified EGFR-YFP constructs
including L858R and L858R/T790M mutants using
site-directed mutagenesis. Equal amounts of DNA were
then individually transfected into CHO cells, and 12 h
post-transfection cells were treated either with vehicle
(DMSO) or with 3 μM erlotinib. We selected this
concentration of erlotinib based on a pharmacodynamic
study in humans that showed that the Cmax of erlotinib is
about 3.5 μM [23]. Immunoblotting analyses indicated
that erlotinib treatment caused faster decay of L858R
mutant protein when compared to L858R/T790M double
mutant (Figure 1A, 1B). In contrast, EGF treatment,
which downregulates EGFR [24], was found to be
equally efficacious in downregulation of both L858R and
L858R/T790M mutants (Figure 1C, 1D), suggesting that
erlotinib selectively induces EGFR degradation only in

lung cancer cells

the cells that contain activating EGFR mutations. In this
model, wild-type (WT) EGFR also showed sensitivity
similar to L858R mutant in response to both EGF and
erlotinib (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B). We also
assessed the effect of erlotinib on EGFR localization in
the live cells using fluorescence microscopy at 2, 8, 18,
and 24 h post treatment. YFP-EGFR (L858R) mutant
expressing cells showed more cytosolic expression with
larger protein aggregates, as opposed to predominantly
membranous localization noted in the L858R/T790M
mutant cells (Supplementary Figure S2A, upper panel).
Furthermore, within 2 h of erlotinib treatment, there was
about a 3 fold increase in cytosolic protein aggregation
in L858R mutant cells followed by a rapid decay in
fluorescence intensity between 8-12 h of drug treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2B). These data are consistent
with the immunoblotting data as shown in Figure 1A.
In contrast, change in localization and fluorescence
intensity were minimal for L858R/T790M mutant cells
during the observation period of 24 h (Supplementary
Figure S2, lower panel).

To confirm the observations made in the ectopic
CHO model, we selected cell lines that contain either
erlotinib sensitive or resistant EGFR mutants frequently
observed in patients (Figure 3A). NCI-H2347,
NCI-H3255, HCC827, HCC-NC4, and NCI-H1975
endogenously expressing WT, L858R, delE746-A750,
S768_D770 duplication, and L858R/T790M mutants,
respectively. NCI-H3255 and HCC827 cells are sensitive
to erlotinib treatment whereas, NCI-H1975 cells are
resistant [25, 26]. As we observed that L858R protein
is more labile than L858R/T790M protein in the ectopic
system, we wished to determine whether erlotinib
could induce more rapid degradation of L858R and
delE746-A750 proteins compared to L858R/T790M
in lung cancer cells. We first noted that the basal level
of EGFR expression was substantially different among
these cell lines (Figure 2A). Based on densitometry

analyses, HCC827, and NCI-H3255 cells expressed
about 2 and 4 times higher levels of EGFR compared to
NCI-H1975 cells, respectively. In spite of such EGFR
overexpression, TKI sensitive cells showed about
50% reduction in EGFR levels within 6 h of erlotinib
treatment. As hypothesized, we found little change in
EGFR protein levels in TKI resistant NCI-H1975 cells
(Figure 2A), whereas, WT EGFR carrying NCI-H2347
cells showed an intermediate response to erlotinibinduced EGFR downregulation (Supplementary Figure
S1C). As we observed differential pharmacodynamic
changes in EGFR protein in TKI sensitive as compared
to resistant cell lines, we further assessed if this relates
to inactivation of EGFR phosphorylation. We noted
that, at the basal level, TKI sensitive HCC827 cells
showed about 5 fold more pEGFR when compared to
TKI resistant NCI-H1975 cells. As previously noted [27]

we also found that erlotinib treatment at sub-micromolar
concentrations blocked EGFR and downstream ERK
phosphorylation within 30 minutes in HCC827 cells
(Figure 2B, left panel). The effect of erlotinib on
inhibition of EGFR and ERK phosphorylation in
TKI resistant NCI-H1975 cells was observed to a
lesser extent (Figure 2B, right panel). Taken together,
these data indicate that other than inhibition of EGFR
phosphorylation, erlotinib exerts differential effects on
EGFR protein stability in cells that harbor TKI sensitive
or resistant EGFR mutations.
Previous studies that have investigated the (lack of)
effect of erlotinib on EGFR phosphorylation in T790M
mutant EGFR were performed in the presence of a high
concentration of EGF (100 ng/ml) [28]. To determine if
erlotinib blocks EGF-induced phosphorylation in TKI
resistant cells, cells were treated with erlotinib in the

presence of EGF. As expected, EGF treatment increased
EGFR phosphorylation (pY1173) in a time-dependent
manner in both HCC827 and NCI-H1975 cells (Figure
2C). In spite high concentration of EGF treatment,
erlotinib inhibited ligand-induced EGFR and ERK
phosphorylation in both the cell lines when compared to
the EGF controls.

were treated with either DMSO or 3 μM erlotinib. Twelve
hours post treatment cells were treated with 50 μg/ml of
cycloheximide (CHX), and samples were collected at
different time points. Samples collected just at the time of
CHX addition were considered as the 0 h time point. We
found that 3 μM erlotinib treatment reduced the L858R
and delE746-A750 protein half-lives to about 1.66 ±
0.39 and 1.92 ± 0.39 h, respectively, as compared to >8
h in case of DMSO-treated control cells (Figure 3A, 3B,
upper and middle panels). A much lower concentration
of erlotinib (300 nM) remained effective in reducing the
half-life of EGFR compared to controls (Supplementary
Figure 1D). In contrast, in NCI-H1975 cells carrying
L858R/T790M EGFR mutations, protein half-life remain

unchanged (>8 h) both in the presence and absence of
erlotinib (Figure 3A, 3B, lower panels). Such data indicate
that erlotinib causes EGFR degradation only in the cases
of L858R and delE746-A750 mutants, whereas, L858R/
T790M mutants are stable, which correlates with cell
death and the clinical outcome.
Third-generation EGFR TKI such as AZD9291 is
known to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation independent to
EGFR kinase mutations and appears to be effective for
patients with T790M-EGFR tumors. We hypothesized

that AZD9291 treatment would be more effective in
erlotinib-resistant NCI-H1975 cells and that it would
induce EGFR degradation in these cells. To test this idea,
we selected 4 cell lines that are driven by either WT- or
mutant-EGFR (Figure 3A) and compared the cellular
viability in response to either erlotinib or AZD9291
using an MTT assay. As shown in the Figure 4A, we
observed that both erlotinib and AZD9291 were effective
in the low-nanomolar range in reducing percent cell
viability of HCC827 cells. Against, cells that are either

harboring the above mentioned EGFR mutations were either treated with DMSO, erlotinib or AZD9291. Four days after treatment cellular
viability was assessed using MTT assay and results were plotted relative to vehicle control. B. To assess the effect of AZD9291 on EGFR
half-life, cell-lines described in Figure 4A were treated as described in Figure 3, and EGFR levels were measured. The mean half-life ±
SEM from three independent experiments for each cell line is shown in the box.

driven by WT-EGFR or by exon 20 insertion, AZD9291
seems more effective compared to erlotinib. In erlotinibresistant NCI-H1975 cells, AZD9291 was effective in
reducing cellular viability where erlotinib was completely
ineffective. We next determined if this difference in
cellular response also correlated with EGFR degradation
in these cell lines, we performed similar experiments to
those described in Figure 3 and determined the influence
of AZD9291 on the half-life of EGFR (Figure 4B and
gray box). We found that AZD9291 reduced the half-life
of EGFR in all 4 cell lines including in erlotinib-resistant
NCI-H1975 cells. These data suggest that response to TKI
correlates with its ability to reduce EGFR protein stability.
To further investigate if TKI treatment affects EGFR
localization, we performed immunofluorescence studies in
NCI-H3255, HCC827 and NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 5A).
These studies suggest that in erlotinib responsive HCC827
and NCI-H3255 cells EGFR is internalized within an hour
of drug exposure followed by its disappearance between
3-6 h post-treatment. In contrast, NCI-H1975 cells
carrying L858R/T790M mutant EGFR showed minimal
change in EGFR localization or its expression. In contrast,
NCI-H1975 cells, carrying L858R/T790M mutant EGFR,
showed minimal change in EGFR localization or its
expression in response to erlotinib. As discussed above
in the Figure 4B, we found that AZD9291 was effective
in reducing EGFR expression in these cells. These results
are consistent with our findings described in the Figure
3 and 4, suggesting differential effects of erlotinib on
protein stability of EGFR mutants. Furthermore, we
noted increased nuclear localization of EGFR primarily
in NCI-H1975 cells. Previously, nuclear EGFR has been
associated with faster disease progression, poor survival,
enhanced resistance both to radio/chemo and anti-EGFR
therapies including gefitinib and cetuximab [29-32]. As
loss of EGFR is known to induce cell death primarily via
the autophagic mode, we treated different lung cancer
cells (NCI-H2347, HCC827, and NCI-H1975 carrying
wild-type, delE746-A750 and L858R/T790M mutant
EGFR respectively) with erlotinib and tested the mode
of cell death using markers of autophagic (LC-3B) cell
death. As shown in Figure 5B, erlotinib-sensitive HCC827
cells showed a time-dependent increase in both autophagic
and apoptotic markers, whereas, the other two cell lines
(NCI-H2347 and NCI-H1975) showed minimal change in
any cell death marker, which was correlated with a lack of
sensitivity to erlotinib.
To address the possibility that erlotinib treatment
alters EGFR at the transcript level, we performed
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) from RNA isolated
from the three different cell lines treated with either
DMSO or erlotinib for different time periods. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S3, no major differences were
noted at the EGFR mRNA levels in all the cell lines
tested. We conclude from these data that L858R and
delE746-A750 mutants are more vulnerable to erlotinibwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced degradation compared to the L858R/T790M
mutant and that this difference is not due to changes in the
EGFR transcription.

Erlotinib induces polyubiquitination-mediated
proteasomal degradation
As erlotinib induced degradation of TKI sensitive
EGFR mutant proteins, we investigated the mechanism
of erlotinib-induced EGFR decay. EGFR is known to
undergo degradation in response to various stimuli
including EGF or chemotherapeutic agents such as
cisplatin. However, the mode of degradation appears to
be different; EGF mainly induces lysosomal degradation
whereas cisplatin causes proteasomal degradation. To
evaluate which pathway of degradation is activated by
erlotinib in TKI sensitive lung cancer cells, HCC827
cells were treated with erlotinib (3 μM) for 12 h and then
exposed to MG132, to inhibit proteasomal activity, or
to 3-methyladenine (3-MA to block lysosomal function,
followed by immunoblotting to assess rescue of EGFR
protein levels. Erlotinib caused a significant decrease in
EGFR protein level within 12 h of drug treatment (~90%
reduction, lane 2) (Figure 6A). Interestingly, inhibition of
proteasomal activity by MG132, partially rescued (~50%
reduction) erlotinib-induced EGFR degradation (lane 3).
Similarly treatment with a lysosomal inhibitor (3-MA)
also rescued (~75% reduction, lane 4), suggesting the
involvement of both pathways.
As the inhibition of the proteasomal pathway
significantly rescued TKI-sensitive EGFR degradation
induced by erlotinib, we hypothesized that erlotinib
induces degradation via polyubiquitination of EGFR.
To test this idea, cells were treated with erlotinib in the
presence or absence of either MG132 or 3-MA for the
indicated time periods. EGFR was immunoprecipitated
using
EGFR-specific
antibody
followed
by
immunoblotting using ubiquitin antibody. As shown in
the Figure 6B (HCC827 cells, left panel), an increase
in polyubiquitinated species of EGFR was noted in the
presence of MG132. Similar studies using erlotinib
resistant NCI-H1975 cells resulted in no change in EGFR
ubiquitination and steady-state levels (Figure 6B, right
panel). Taken together, these data indicate that erlotinib
specifically induces a polyubiquitination-mediated
proteasomal/lysosomal degradation of EGFR in TKI
sensitive cells but does not affect EGFR levels in TKI
resistant cells.
Prior studies have suggested that EGF-induced
EGFR degradation depends on c-CBL. To address c-CBL
involvement in differential sensitivity to erlotinib with
respect to EGFR mutation and degradation, we first
analyzed c-CBL binding with WT, L858R, and L858R/
T790M EGFR mutants. Interestingly, L858R EGFR, the
most sensitive mutant to erlotinib mediated degradation,
was the least associated with c-CBL (Figure 6C). In

additional experiments, c-CBL knockdown in NCI-H2347
and NCI-H1975 cell lines failed to show either EGFR
accumulation or EGF/erlotinib-induced alteration in
EGFR steady-state levels (Figure 5D). In TKI-sensitive
HCC827 cells, siRNA-mediated c-CBL knockdown
caused only a minimal increase (~1.5 fold) in EGFR
steady state-levels, and the rate of erlotinib-induced EGFR
downregulation was only minimally rescued (only about

10%) (Figure 6D). We also compared the gene expression
profile of EGFR and c-CBL in a large data sets available
in ‘cBioportal’. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, no
obvious inverse correlation between EGFR and c-CBL was
noted in any of the reported studies. We performed further
detailed analyses on samples from three specific studies
on patients with glioblastoma multiforme (n=136), lung
adenocarcinoma (n=230) and head and neck squamous

Figure 7A, there was a significant increase (about 7-fold)
(p < 0.0001) in bioluminescence within 4 h of 3 μM
erlotinib treatment, which gradually decreased over 24 h
post-treatment (p = 0.0022 at 8h and p = 0.02 at 24 h),
indicating that erlotinib inhibits EGFR phosphorylation
in this cell line. Next, we confirmed the use of this realtime non-invasive method to detect an effect of erlotinib
treatment on EGFR activity using a mouse xenograft
model. As shown in Figure 7B and quantified in Figure

increased about 8 fold within 4 h of erlotinib treatment
(p <0.0001) and decreased back to the basal levels
within 24 h post treatment (p =0.96). Although these in
vivo observations suggest that the effect of erlotinib on
EGFR is less durable compared to our in vitro model, it

We used a luciferase-based reporter to investigate
EGFR signaling events in real time both in vitro and
in tumors implanted in nude mice [33]. To utilize
such a system, first, we established NCI-H1975 cells
stably transfected with the bioluminescence EGFR
reporter (BER). In this system, inhibition of EGFR
phosphorylation is associated with an increase in

were treated with 3 µM erlotinib or DMSO (control) and bioluminescence activity was recorded after 10 min of treatment up to 24 h. Data
were normalized to control values and plotted as mean ± SEM. B. In vivo bioluminescence activity was obtained from nude mice bearing
NCI-H1975-BER flank tumors before and after treatment with erlotinib at the indicated time points. C. Fold change in EGFR reporter
activity was calculated using the pre-treatment values as the baseline and plotted as mean ± SEM. D. Animals were randomized into
two groups (n=5) and given either 100 mg/kg of erlotinib or saline as described in Materials and Methods. Tumor volume was measured
daily, and tumor volume was plotted as the mean ± SEM (p=0.97). E–F. On day 18, mice were treated with 100 mg/kg erlotinib, and 4 h
post-treatment animals were euthanized and their tumors were harvested. Tumor cell lysates were prepared using a standardized protocol
and immunoblotted using phospho EGFR, total EGFR, phospho ERK, total ERK with GAPDH used as a loading control. The ratio of

was consistent up to 8 hours post treatment. The effect of
erlotinib treatment on tumor growth was recorded daily for
18 days. In spite of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation,
weekly administration of erlotinib failed to delay tumor
growth (Figure 7D) (p = 0.97), which is consistent with
the previous reports. We further determined the effect of
erlotinib treatment on inhibition of phospho EGFR and
phospho ERK using immunoblotting (Figure 7E and 7F).
As shown in Figure 7E, the ratio of pEGFR/EGFR was
lower in erlotinib-treated animals (p = 0.02). However,
the change in ERK phosphorylation was not significantly
different in the erlotinib-treated group (p = 0.14).
Taken together, these data show that although erlotinib
blocks EGFR phosphorylation, it failed to cause EGFR
degradation and had no effect on tumor growth in T790Mdriven NCI-H1975 tumors.

and cell division, the physical presence of the protein
has functions beyond kinase activity [35]. For example,
EGFR is known to protect cells from autophagy by a
kinase-independent mechanism [36]. In glioblastoma,
EGFRvIII is known to sequester the proapoptotic protein
PUMA in a kinase-independent manner which promotes
drug resistance [37]. In addition, EGFR knockout is
embryonically lethal in mice [38], whereas, transgenic
mice expressing a kinase-dead form of EGFR are viable
with minimal defects [39]. Similarly, erlotinib treatment
inhibits phosphorylation of EGFR and its down-stream
effector molecule ERK in cells collected from the oral
cavity of patients or normal lung fibroblasts that contain
wild-type EGFR without induction of substantial celldeath [40]. These results suggest that EGFR kinase
activity is important for tumorigenesis, but its physical
presence might be enough to promote cell survival,
likely by forming hetero- or homo- dimer formation
with other family members [41]. These interactions
are known to facilitate down-stream signaling through
molecules such as AKT which has been implicated in
resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib treatment [34, 41, 42].
Clinical findings consistent with this idea come from a
phase I clinical trial in which head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients were undergoing
combination treatment with the anti-EGFR antibody
cetuximab with increasing doses of the proteasomal
inhibitor, bortezomib. That study reported faster
disease progression compared to the historic control,
and molecular analysis of tumor specimens revealed
stabilization of EGFR by this combination as a potential
mechanism of tumor progression [17].
The mechanism by which the T790M mutation
becomes dominant within a tumor is of significant interest.
Earlier studies indicated that only a small percentage of
NSCLC patients harbor T790M-EGFR mutations, and
a higher frequency is observed only in patients treated
with TKI, which coincides with acquired resistance. This
observation led to the thought that T790M is an acquired
mutation, which causes resistance to TKI treatment [7,
26]. Recent studies propose a condition under which this
mutation could be acquired [43]. Alternatively, studies
using sensitive technologies such as Matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI) Time of Flight-Mass
Spectrometry (TOF-MS) have suggested that T790MEGFR may be a de novo mutation, and its presence
correlates with the duration of response to TKI’s [44].
These findings suggest that treatment with TKI might
not be causing the induction of a new point mutation
(T790M), but cells that contain this mutation are selected
for during treatment with EGFR TKIs.
Furthermore, computational and structural
analyses have also confirmed that TKIs can efficiently
bind with either inactive or active conformations of
EGFR [45]. However, Gibbs free energy landscape
analysis predicts that WT-EGFR is relatively more

DISCUSSION
From this study, we propose an additional
mechanism of differential responsiveness of TKI
sensitive (L858R, delE746-A750) and resistant (T790M)
EGFR mutants to erlotinib treatment. Our data suggest
a differential effect of erlotinib on destabilizing various
EGFR mutants which, along with differential ATP affinity
and drug binding of EGFR mutants, is responsible for
differential therapeutic outcomes observed in subsets of
NSCLC patients. Based on an ectopic EGFR expression
model, cancer cell lines expressing various EGFR
mutants, and a tumor xenograft model, we found that
erlotinib inhibits EGFR phosphorylation across the
models, but protein degradation is induced only in the
case of erlotinib responsive cells, which correlates with
the response. Our study adds to the potential mechanisms
by which resistance to TKIs can develop and is consistent
with an earlier study with PC9 cells that contained the
delE746-A750 mutant EGFR. Treatment of these cells
with gefitinib caused rapid internalization of surface
EGFR, which was not the case in TKI resistant cell lines
that contained wild-type EGFR [34]. In contrast, here
we show that ligand-induced degradation of EGFR is
independent of kinase mutations, as both the sensitive and
the resistant EGFR mutants show a similar rate of EGFR
decay upon stimulation with EGF. Our data also indicate
that continuous treatment with erlotinib blocks EGFR
phosphorylation and down-stream signaling in both TKIsensitive and resistant cells, but EGFR is degraded only in
the erlotinib responsive cell lines. Erlotinib induced EGFR
degradation appears to be c-CBL-independent. These
are novel observations and are in contrast to the notion
that suggests that erlotinib treatment blocks EGFR and
c-CBL binding in cells that express TKI resistant mutant
EGFR, thus inhibiting EGFR degradation resulting in TKI
resistance.
Our findings are consistent with the idea that
although kinase activity is important for cell growth

stable compared to highly active L858R-EGFR protein,
which is thermodynamically labile. Further structural
and thermodynamic analysis of EGFR shows that EGFR
prefers the inactive conformation to gain thermodynamic
stability [46]. A previous computational study predicted
that T790M or L858R -EGFR mutants are more stable in
the active state [47]. Our findings are in agreement with
this analysis, which suggests that L858R-EGFR is more
active compared to both WT- or T790M-EGFR, that show
reduced tyrosine phosphorylation when compared to TKI
sensitive L858R-EGFR. The exact relationship between
EGFR kinase thermodynamic stability and overall protein
stability with respect to TKI mutants needs further
investigation.
Several ubiquitin ligases (E3) have been shown to
regulate EGFR protein stability [48-52]. Amongst those
c-CBL is most studied E3 controlling EGFR protein levels.
In order to determine the role of c-CBL in differential
degradation of EGFR mutants, we assessed EGFR and
c-CBL binding, the effect of c-CBL knockdown on steady
state levels of EGFR and c-CBL’s effect on EGF and
erlotinib-induced EGFR degradation (Figure 5). We have
noted that ligand-induced EGFR downregulation may be
a c-CBL independent process, and our data indicate that
binding of TKI sensitive L858R EGFR with c-CBL is, in
fact, minor when compared to WT and L858R/T790M
mutant. Overall, our data indicate a minimal role of c-CBL
in regulating EGFR protein stability. This is consistent
with the recent findings from the Band laboratory that
Cbl is dispensable for internalization and degradation
of EGFR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from
c-CBL knockout mice [53]. In addition, we found no
correlation between EGFR and c-CBL mRNA expression
across different cancer types (Supplementary Figure
S4) and between EGFR protein expression and c-CBL
mRNA levels in cancer known to be driven by EGFR
(Supplementary Figure S5).
EGFR is known to regulate tumor progression
and the autophagic process [54], but the role of TKI
sensitivities/resistant mutation in autophagic death is not
clear [36, 55, 56]. For instance, TKI resistant PC9 cells
undergo autophagy upon knock-down of T790M-EGFR
using si-RNA [57]. A recent study found that TKI sensitive
EGFR mutant cells show activation of the autophagic
process upon treatment with TKI. Inhibition of autophagy
conferred resistance to TKI [56]. We have also reported
that loss of EGFR protein upon knock-down of the E3
ligase SMURF2, induced autophagy and sensitized tumor
cells [58]. Overall, these studies suggest a potential role of
autophagic death in TKI sensitive EGFR mutant tumors.
In this study (Figure 5B, 5C) we have confirmed the
induction of both autophagic and apoptotic cell death upon
treatment of TKI-sensitive HCC827 cells with erlotinib.
In contrast, TKI resistant NCI-H1975 (L858R/T790M
mutant EGFR) cells showed minimal alteration of LC3B with no detectable PARP cleavage (not shown). These
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

responses correlate well with erlotinib effects on EGFR
protein stability.
Currently, the treatment options for patients with
TKI resistant mutations in EGFR including T790M are
limited. However, recent development of 3rd generation of
TKI’s (such as AZD9291) has shown promising results in
early clinical trials. What is the precise difference in the
mechanisms of action between erlotinib and AZD9291
is not clear at this time. However, we also observed
that AZD9291 is effective in reducing cell viability of
erlotinib-resistant cells, and that it affects EGFR protein
stability where erlotinib is completely ineffective. Our
findings suggest that resistance to TKIs may partly be
attributed to increased protein stability of T790M mutant
EGFR. This led us to hypothesize that the molecular
regulator(s), which may be cooperating with EGFR via
blocking the mutant protein from undergoing proteasomal
degradation, may be critical therapeutic targets in
overcoming resistance. In our previous studies, we have
identified two such factors, chaperone heat shock protein
90 (HSP90) [18, 19] and Smad ubiquitination regulatory
factor 2 (SMURF2) [58], which provide increased EGFR
protein stability. In the light of the current observation, it
would be interesting to decipher whether HSP90 and/or
SMURF2 are differentially involved in providing protein
stability to the EGFR L858R/T790M mutant. Furthermore,
it remains to be determined if these factors indeed play
any role either in response to TKI’s or in the development
of resistance.

General Hospital, Boston). SCCNC4 cell line was a
gift from Mario Hermsen (Instituto Universitario de
Oncología, Spain). NCI-H3255 cells were grown in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with insulin (20 μg/

(100 pM), bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), HEPES (10
mM), sodium pyruvate (0.5 mM) and L-glutamine (2
mM). All other cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For all in
vitro experiments, cells were released from flasks using
PBS containing 0.25% trypsin and 0.2 mM EDTA, and
cells were plated onto culture dishes one day prior to
any treatment. All the cell lines are routinely tested for
pathogen and genotyped to confirm their authenticity.

at 4 °C. The soluble protein fraction was mixed with
1X Laemmli buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min, then
applied to a 4–12% Bis-Tris precast gel (Invitrogen), and
transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were
incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer
consisting of 3% BSA and 1% normal goat serum in Trisbuffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Membranes were subsequently
incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml primary antibody
in blocking buffer, washed, and incubated for 1 h with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(Cell Signaling). After three additional washes in Trisbuffered saline, bound antibody was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence plus reagent (GE Healthcare). For
quantification of relative protein levels, immunoblot films
were scanned and analyzed using ImageJ 1.44p software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The relative
protein levels shown represent a comparison to untreated
controls. For EGFR immunoprecipitation, studies were
performed as described previously [19].

MTT assay
The cell proliferation assay was performed using
MTT kit (Roche product # 11465007001) and assays were
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In
brief, 3000 cells in 100 µl of complete medium were plated
per well in a 96-well plate 24 h prior to drug treatment.
Cells were then either treated with vehicle (DMSO) or
serial dilutions of TKIs (either erlotinib or AZD9291).
Four days following treatments MTT labelling reagent was
added, and cells were allowed to form formazan crystals
for 2 h. Following, 100 µl of solubilizing agent (10%
SDS in 0.01M HCl) was added per well, and plates were
incubated at 37° C overnight. The optical density (OD)
of the solubilized formazan was spectrophotometrically
quantified using a plate reader at 570 nm with a reference
at 650 nm. Data represent the mean (± standard error, SE)
performed in quadruplicate, and percent cell viabilities are
plotted in semi-logarithmic scale relative to DMSO treated
control.

Live fluorescence microscopy and protein decay
studies
CHO cells were transfected with an equal amount (3
μg) of DNA templates of WILD-TYPE, L858R or L858R/
T790M mutant EGFR constructs. Twelve hours posttransfection, cells were either treated with DMSO or with
3 μM erlotinib and EGFR-YFP expression and localization
were monitored at regular intervals. Fluorescence and
phase-contrast microscopic images were captured using a
DS-Fi1 (Nikon, Melville, NY) camera fitted on an Olympus
1X-71 microscope. For comparative analyses fluorescence
images were captured keeping the exposure time constant.
For protein decay studies, EGFR expressing
cells were treated 12 h post transfection with DMSO or
erlotinib, and cell lysates were prepared at specific time
points. Immunoblotting was carried out for EGFR and
GAPDH to analyze any alteration of EGFR steady state
levels with time.

Transfection and protein analyses

Protein half-life studies

CHO cells were transfected using Lipofectamine
reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
siRNA Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen) was used
as described previously [58]. Immunoblot analysis and
immunoprecipitation techniques were performed as
described previously [58] using lysis buffer consisting
of 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1.3
mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1
mM NaF, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol,
1% NP-40, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma;
Cat. No. P8340). For cell lysate preparation, cells were
washed once with ice-cold PBS followed by addition of
the required amount of lysis buffer. Cells were scraped
and sonicated. After sonication, particulate materials
were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min

The effect of erlotinib or AZD9291 on EGFR
half-life was determined in various cell lines known to
harbor different EGFR mutations (Figure 3A). A day
before treatment with TKI, cells were plated at 40 percent
confluency and either treated with DMSO (vehicle control)
or with erlotinib (3 μM) or AZD9291 (200 nM). Twelve
hours later, protein synthesis was blocked by treatment
with freshly prepared cycloheximide (50 μg/ml). Cells
were harvested at the indicated times post-treatment,
and immunoblotting was carried out for total EGFR and
GAPDH to analyze the protein half-life of EGFR. The
approximate EGFR protein half-life (t1/2) in the absence
and presence of TKI was calculated using data (mean ±
SEM) from three independent experiments by plotting

measured every day beginning on day 0 (pre-treatment).
Tumor volume was calculated as follows: volume (cm3)
= (L x W2)/2. When tumor volume reached 10-fold from
the day treatment began (day 18), mice were re-treated
with erlotinib. Four hours later they were euthanized,
and tumors were harvested. The effects of erlotinib on
phospho EGFR, total EGFR, phospho ERK1/2, and
total ERK1/2 were analyzed by immunoblotting.

Immunofluorescence studies
Cells were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes on sterile
glass coverslips for a day. After treatment, coverslips were
removed and fixed with 10 percent phosphate buffered
formalin for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were
washed once with TBS and permeabilized with 100
percent methanol (-20° C) for 5 minutes and rehydrated
with TBS for 20 minutes. Non-specific antigens were
blocked (5% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.2% Triton x100
in TBS) for an hour at room temperature. EGFR or LC3B expression was assessed by incubation of cells with
anti-EGFR (Sc-03, 1:100) or anti-LC-3B antibody (CST
cat# 3868, 1:200) at 4° C overnight. The slides were then
washed with TBS thrice, incubated with the fluorescenceconjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h (488 or 594 Alexa
Fluor conjugated secondary antibody, 1:100 dilution),
washed thrice, and prepared with a coverslip after a drop
of ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent with 4′, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) was added to each
sample. Fluorescence images were acquired using a DSFi1 (Nikon, Melville, NY) camera fitted on an Olympus
1X-71 microscope.

In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Live-cell
bioluminescence
imaging
was
performed on the mice using the IVIS imaging system
(Caliper Life Sciences, Hopinkton, MA, USA). Mice
were injected with 100 µL of 40 mg/mL D-luciferin
dissolved in PBS and anesthetized with 2% isoflurane.
5 minutes after luciferin injection, bioluminescence
images were acquired. Imaging was performed before
the first erlotinib/vehicle treatments (pre-treatment) and
at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours following treatment. Foldchange in EGFR reporter activity at each time point
was calculated using pretreatment values as baseline
measurements.

Statistics
A linear regression was used to model the level of
EGFR protein as a function of time, and an interaction
between the treatment group and time point was tested to
compare the rate of protein degradation between controls
and erlotinib. The half-life of EGFR protein (corresponds
to 50% reduction of the EGFR) was calculated from
the estimated regression function, with a standard
error obtained using the delta method. A linear mixed
effects model was used to estimate the tumor growth.
A random effect was included in the model to consider
the correlation between the two tumors within the same
animal. An ANOVA model was used to compare the
relative change in bioluminescence between groups at a
particular time point. The difference in pEGFR/EGFR or
pERK/ERK between control and erlotinib was assessed
by a two-sample Wilcoxon test. Statistical significance
was defined as a two-sided P-value <0.05. All analyses
were conducted using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

RNA isolation and quantitation
Total cellular RNA was isolated using a Qiagen
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantitation, RNA
samples (1 μg) were reverse transcribed with random
hexamers using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
carried out with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector
using Power SYBR GREEN PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems). The following human gene-specific primers
were used for the PCR reaction: 1) EGFR (forward,
5′ CAGCGCTACCTTGTCATTCA 3′ and reverse, 5′
TGCACTCAGAGAGCTCAGGA 3′) and 2) GAPDH
(forward, 5′ GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT 3′ and
reverse, 5′ TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG 3′).

Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed according
to University of Michigan-approved protocols and
conform to their relevant regulatory standards. A
suspension of erlotinib was made in saline with 0.1%
Tween-80. Athymic nude female mice (4-5 weeks
old) (Harlan Laboratories) bearing NCI-H1975-EGFR
reporter [bioluminescent EGFR reporter; BER [33]
flank tumors were dosed at 100 mg/kg via oral gavage
on days 1 and 8 for efficacy studies. Control mice were
treated with vehicle. Tumor length and width were
