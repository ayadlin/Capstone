Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) is one of the most promising candidates for new
cancer therapeutics. A current problem is that some cancers
still remain resistant to TRAIL. We show for the first time that
a naturally occurring flavonoid, baicalein, overcomes TRAIL
resistance in cancer cells. The combination of baicalein and
TRAIL effectively induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant colon
cancer SW480 cells. Baicalein up-regulated the expression of
death receptor 5 (DR5) among TRAIL receptors at the mRNA
and protein levels. Suppression of this up-regulation with
small interfering RNA (siRNA) efficiently reduced the apoptosis induced by TRAIL and baicalein, suggesting that the
sensitization was mediated through DR5 induction. Moreover,
baicalein also overcame TRAIL resistance with DR5 upregulation in prostate cancer PC3 cells. Of note, the
combination of TRAIL and baicalein hardly induced apoptosis
in normal human cells, such as blood cells and hepatocytes.
Baicalein increased DR5 promoter activity, and this enhanced
activity was diminished by mutation of a CCAAT/enhancerbinding protein homologous protein (CHOP)–binding site in
SW480 cells. In SW480 cells, CHOP siRNA blocked both
functions of baicalein. CHOP expression was induced by
baicalein in SW480 cells; however, in PC3 cells, baicalein
scarcely induced CHOP and mutation of the CHOP-binding
site did not abrogate the DR5 promoter activation by
baicalein. Interestingly, baicalein induced reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and a ROS scavenger prevented DR5 expression
and TRAIL sensitization in PC3 but not SW480 cells. These
results indicate that, using two different pathways, baicalein
exposes cancer surveillance of TRAIL and overcomes TRAIL
resistance in cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8918–27]

Introduction
Baicalein is a flavonoid derived from the root of Scutellaria
baicalensis, widely used in Chinese herbal medicine. Baicalein is
also known as a selective 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) inhibitor (1),
which induces antiproliferation and apoptosis in various cancer

cells (2–4). However, this flavonoid also has other activities, such
as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidative, and prooxidative effects
(5, 6). Thus, the molecular mechanism of the antitumor effect is
still unclear.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical signaling molecules
and play important roles in a variety of normal biochemical
functions and abnormal pathologic processes.
In cancer cells, some chemotherapeutic agents and radiation
therapy generate ROS and lead to necrotic or apoptotic cell death
(7, 8). Thus, a therapeutic strategy is proposed to use ROSgenerating compounds in cancer therapy. Tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) selectively
induces apoptosis in various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, with
little or no toxicity in normal cells (9–12). Endogeneous TRAIL is
expressed in immune cells and contributes to immunosurveillance
for cancer (13). Furthermore, TRAIL deficiency in mice accelerates
malignant tumors (14). Therefore, TRAIL is one of the most
promising agents for cancer therapeutics. Death receptor 5 (DR5;
also called TRAIL-R2 or KILLER) is a receptor for TRAIL. TRAIL
interacts with DR5 or DR4 (also called TRAIL-R1), leading to
aggregation of the receptors, recruitment of the adaptor molecule
FADD, and activation of initiator caspase-8 or caspase-10, which
can directly evoke cleavage of downstream effector caspases
(15, 16). On the other hand, Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
member, is also cleaved by caspase-8 or caspase-10 and then
activates the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. Decoy
receptor 1 (DcR1) and DcR2 are also TRAIL receptors and have
dominant negative effects by competing with DRs for TRAIL
interaction (16). Interestingly, some studies have reported that
DR5 is expressed more abundantly in cancer cells than in normal
cells (17, 18). Accordingly, the TRAIL-DR5 pathway is considered to
be an attractive candidate for cancer chemotherapy, and clinical
trials with recombinant human TRAIL and agonistic DR5 antibodies are ongoing (19). However, some tumors remain tolerant
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (20). Thus, it is important to
overcome this resistance to expand the ability of TRAIL in cancer
therapy.
Here, we report, for the first time, that baicalein overcomes
TRAIL resistance in cancer, but not normal cells, through DR5 upregulation mediated by two different pathways, ROS induction and
up-regulation of a transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein homologous protein (CHOP/GADD153).

was purchased from PeproTech. Human recombinant DR5/Fc chimera and
caspase inhibitors, such as zVAD-fmk, were purchased from R&D Systems.
Catalase was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell culture. Human colon cancer SW480 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mmol/L glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Human prostate
cancer PC3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L
glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Normal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using a FicollPaque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and maintained in X-VIVO 20 (Cambrex)
serum-free medium with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma). Normal
human hepatocytes (Cell System-Hc cells) were obtained from Cell Systems
and maintained in SFM CS-C medium according to the instructions of the
supplier. All cells were incubated at 37jC, with humidity and 5% CO2.
Plasmid preparation. As previously described (21), the digested
SacI-NocI fragment from the DR5 promoter region of the human genomic
DNA was subcloned into the SacI-NcoI site of the pGVB2 luciferase assay
vector (Toyo Ink) to produce pDR5PF. Deletion mutants of pDR5PF,
termed pDR5/BamHI, pDR5/ 605, pDR5/ 347, and pDR5/ 198 were
generated using the Mungbean-Exonuclease III system from the
Kilo-sequence deletion kit (Takara). The construct pDR5/mtCHOP, which
has a mutation in the CHOP-binding site at 272/ 269, was generated by
site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change XL Site-Directed
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) from pDR5/ 347. The reporter plasmid
CHOP 3K, which contains 3 kbp of the CHOP promoter, was previously
described (22).
Transfection and luciferase assay. A series of DR5 reporter plasmids
and vacant vector plasmid (1.0 Ag) were transfected into cells (1.0  105)
using the DEAE-dextran method (GE Healthcare). After 24 h, the cells were
treated with or without baicalein (40 Amol/L) for 24 h and then harvested.
Levels of luciferase activity were detected in triplicate, and the experiments
were repeated several times.
RNA isolation and quantification analysis by real-time reverse
transcription–PCR. DR5 mRNA expression was determined by reverse
transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells
using the Sepasol RNAI (Nakalai Tesque), and cDNA was synthesized from
2 Ag of total RNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and
amplified by PCR using Taqman Probes purchased from Applied
Biosystems.
Detection of apoptosis. DNA fragmentation was quantified by the
percentage of hypodiploid DNA (sub-G1). In brief, cells were pretreated with
the indicated concentration of baicalein and/or TRAIL for 24 h. After
being washed with PBS, the collected cells were suspended in 0.1% Triton
X-100/PBS solution. Cells were then treated with RNase A (Sigma), and the
nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma). The DNA content was
measured using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). For each experiment,
10,000 events were analyzed. Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson) was
used to analyze the data.
For morphologic features, SW480 cells were washed in PBS, fixed in
methanol, incubated with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution for 30 min
in the dark, and then analyzed using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus) at
420 nm.
Western blot analysis. Whole cell lysate containing 50 Ag of protein was
separated on a 10% to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis and
blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Rabbit
polyclonal DR5 and DR4 (Prosci), DcR1 and DcR2 (Imgenex), caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology), CHOP (GADD153), Bcl-XL, cellular inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (cIAP-1) and Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), survivin,
cIAP-2 (R&D Systems) antibodies and mouse monoclonal X-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis protein (XIAP; R&D Systems), caspase-8, caspase-9, and
caspase-10 antibodies (MBL), Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz), and h-actin antibody
(Sigma) were used as the primary antibodies. The signal was detected with
an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot analysis system (GE
Healthcare).
Small interfering RNAs. The DR5, DR4, CHOP, and LacZ small
interfering RNA (siRNA) was described previously (23, 24) and synthesized

by Proligo. One day before transfection, the cells were seeded into the
medium without antibiotics at a density of 30% to 40%. The siRNA was
transfected with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after
transfection, the cells were treated with baicalein and/or TRAIL and then
harvested.
Measurement of intercellular ROS. Cells were pretreated with
40 Am baicalein or DMSO for 12 h and treated with 10 Amol/L
5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl
ester (CM-H2DCFDA) dye (Molecular Probes). After 30 min of incubation,
the increase in fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. The mean
fluorescence intensity at 530 nm was calculated.
Statistical analysis. Tests for statistical significance were performed
using a two-tailed, paired Student’s t test. Samples were considered
significantly different when P < 0.05.

Results
Baicalein overcomes TRAIL resistance in SW480 colon
cancer cells. At first, we investigated the effect of baicalein on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by measuring the sub-G1 population.
Baicalein or exogenous recombinant human TRAIL alone slightly
induced apoptosis in SW480 colon cancer cells (Fig. 1A). However,
the combined treatment with TRAIL and baicalein markedly
induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.
DR5/Fc chimeric protein and caspase inhibitors block
apoptosis enhanced by the combination of TRAIL and
baicalein. As shown in Fig. 1B, we showed that the pan-caspase
inhibitor zVAD-fmk and caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and
caspase-10 inhibitors attenuated the increase in the sub-G1
population induced by the combination of TRAIL and baicalein,
suggesting that the sub-G1 population reflects caspase-dependent
apoptosis. To confirm that the apoptosis caused by the combination of baicalein and TRAIL is mediated through death receptors,
we used DR5/Fc chimeric protein, which has a dominant-negative
function against the TRAIL receptors. The DR5/Fc protein
efficiently blocked apoptosis caused by TRAIL and baicalein in
SW480 cells (Fig. 1C). Figure 2A shows the morphologic features of
SW480 cells treated with TRAIL and baicalein. Combined
treatment with TRAIL and baicalein forced most of the cells to
float, and the phenomena were efficiently blocked by cotreatment
with zVAD-fmk whereas each agent alone did not cause marked
change. The cells treated with both TRAIL and baicalein exhibited
the characteristic features of apoptosis, including chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2B), whereas
zVAD-fmk efficiently blocked the morphologic change caused by
TRAIL and baicalein. We also showed that the combination of
baicalein and TRAIL cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9,
caspase-10, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), whereas
zVAD-fmk blocked this cleavage (Fig. 2C). These results indicate
that baicalein strongly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a
synergistic fashion through a caspase pathway.
Baicalein induces DR5 mRNA and protein expression in
SW480 cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which
baicalein enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we examined DR5
up-regulation by baicalein in SW480 cells. First, we carried out
Western blotting to investigate the induction of DR5 protein.
Baicalein considerably increased DR5 protein in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3A). Moreover, we investigated the cell surface
expression of DR5, which was functionally active, using immunostaining and flow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A,
baicalein promoted the cell surface expression of DR5. We also
examined the increase of DR5 mRNA by real-time PCR. Baicalein

substantially up-regulated DR5 mRNA expression in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3B).
Baicalein does not markedly affect the protein expression of
other TRAIL receptors, IAPs, and Bcl-family proteins in SW480
cells. To investigate whether other TRAIL receptors are relevant to
the sensitization of the TRAIL-induced apoptosis by baicalein, we
carried out Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, baicalein did not
change the expression of DR4, DcR1, and DcR2. We also examined
the expression of IAP family proteins, which can suppress caspase
activity and protect cells from apoptosis. Protein levels of XIAP,
cIAP-1, and survivin in Western blotting were not significantly
changed by baicalein treatment in SW480 cells. cIAP-2 was weakly
decreased by baicalein treatment. Next, we carried out Western
blotting of several Bcl family proteins associated with the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Bax proteins was not influenced by baicalein. Moreover, the
protein levels of cFLIP were not altered by baicalein (data not
shown). These findings suggest that baicalein did not markedly
affect the protein expression of TRAIL receptors, except for DR5,
IAP family proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax in SW480 cells.
Down-regulation of DR5 prevented the apoptosis induced by
the combination of baicalein and TRAIL. We showed that

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

baicalein up-regulated DR5 expression and sensitized cancer cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To confirm that the up-regulation by
baicalein is responsible for sensitization to TRAIL, we used a siRNA
targeting DR5 and blocked the induction of DR5 expression by
baicalein. As shown in Fig. 3D, the DR5 siRNA efficiently downregulated DR5 and prevented the sensitizing effect of baicalein on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, down-regulation of
DR4 did not block the apoptosis induced by the combination of
baicalein and TRAIL. These results indicate that baicalein
sensitizes SW480 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis due to the
up-regulation of DR5.
Baicalein also sensitizes other human malignant tumor cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through DR5 up-regulation. We
next investigated whether baicalein enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in other human malignant tumor cells using human prostate
cancer PC3 cells. Combined treatment with baicalein and TRAIL
induced apoptosis more strongly in PC3 cells than did baicalein or
TRAIL alone (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, caspase inhibitors and
DR5/Fc protein efficiently blocked apoptosis caused by TRAIL and
baicalein in PC3 cells. Moreover, baicalein dose-dependently increased
protein levels of DR5 (Fig. 4C) and enhanced cell surface expression of
DR5 in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B), suggesting that baicalein

Baicalein Overcomes TRAIL Resistance

sensitizes PC3 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through a DR5caspase pathway.
Baicalein does not enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
normal PBMCs or in hepatocytes. Next, we investigated whether
the combination of baicalein and TRAIL is toxic to normal human
cells. We used normal human PBMCs and hepatocytes as models.
Interestingly, the combination of baicalein and TRAIL scarcely
induced apoptosis in PBMCs and hepatocytes, although it markedly
induced apoptosis in SW480 cells (Fig. 4D). In a microscopic
examination, apoptotic morphologic changes were rarely detected

in hepatocytes treated with TRAIL and baicalein. Moreover,
we investigated the effects of TRAIL and baicalein on PBMCs
or hepatocytes from two more individuals. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, the cotreatment with baicalein and TRAIL hardly
enhanced apoptosis in PBMCs and hepatocytes.
CHOP is increased by baicalein and responsible for DR5 upregulation in SW480 cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether
baicalein could activate the DR5 promoter using a series of DR5
reporter plasmids. We found that the promoter activity of pDR5PF, a
luciferase reporter plasmid containing a 2.5-kbp fragment of the DR5

promoter region, was increased by baicalein in SW480 cells (Fig. 5A).
This result suggests that baicalein regulates DR5 expression through
transcription.
In SW480 cells, luciferase activity from pDR5/ 347, as well as
pDR5PF, was increased by baicalein, whereas that from pDR5/ 198
was not. This observation suggests that the major baicaleinresponsive elements are located within a 149-bp region between
347 and 198 relative to the first base of the translation initiation
codon. This region contains a potential CHOP-binding site. To
determine whether CHOP is associated with transactivation of the
DR5 promoter by baicalein, we introduced a site-directed mutation
into the CHOP-binding site to generate pDR5/mtCHOP from
pDR5/ 347. Luciferase assays with these plasmids showed that the
mutation abrogated the activation of the DR5 promoter by
baicalein (Fig. 5A). Moreover, baicalein facilitated CHOP binding
to DR5 promoter evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay in SW480 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

indicate that CHOP is responsible for DR5 up-regulation by
baicalein in SW480 cells. Western blotting showed that CHOP
protein was markedly increased by baicalein treatment in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5B). Moreover, baicalein also enhanced
CHOP promoter activity, indicating that CHOP is also induced by
baicalein at a transcriptional level through the promoter in SW480
cells.
ROS are responsible for DR5 up-regulation in PC3 cells, but
not in SW480 cells. The luciferase assay in PC3 cells showed
different findings from that in SW480 cells. Luciferase activity from
pDR5/PF and pDR5/-347 was increased by baicalein, but the
mutation at the CHOP-binding site did not completely abrogate the
activation by baicalein in PC3 cells, although baicalein moderately
increased the CHOP protein level and CHOP promoter activity in
PC3 cells compared with SW480 cells (Fig. 5C and D). Additionally,
ChIP assay revealed that baicalein hardly promotes CHOP binding
to DR5 promoter in PC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These

Baicalein Overcomes TRAIL Resistance

findings indicate that DR5 up-regulation by baicalein in PC3 cells is
almost independent of CHOP, and other mechanisms may
participate in the up-regulation.
Baicalein is known to have ROS-generating ability (25–27). Thus,
we investigated whether ROS are related to DR5 up-regulation by
baicalein. As shown in Fig. 6A, 12 h after treatment with 40 Amol/L
baicalein, the intracellular ROS level rose moderately in PC3 cells,
but not in SW480 cells. Then, a hydrogen peroxide scavenger,
catalase, efficiently blocked the apoptosis caused by TRAIL and
baicalein in PC3 cells, but not in SW480 cells (Fig. 6B). Meanwhile,
a metabolite of 12-LOX activity, 12-HETE, could not attenuate the
apoptosis in either cell line. Western blotting revealed that catalase
attenuated the expression of DR5 protein induced by baicalein in

PC3 cells, but not in SW480 cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, siRNA
targeting CHOP attenuated DR5 induction by baicalein and
efficiently blocked the sensitizing effect on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in SW480 cells, although siRNA did not completely
block them. However, a similar effect was not observed in PC3 cells
(data not shown). These findings imply that DR5 induction by
baicalein may be independent of the intracellular ROS level in
SW480 cells, whereas DR5 up-regulation by baicalein in PC3 cells is
due to an increase of the intracellular ROS level (Fig. 6D).
We additionally performed the similar experiments using four
other cell lines. Baicalein up-regulated DR5 expression mainly
through CHOP and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis not
only in SW480 cells but also colon cancer HCT116-(p53 / )

recombinant human TRAIL and agonistic TRAIL receptor antibodies (19). Considerable numbers of cancer cells, however, are
resistant to apoptosis induced by TRAIL (20). Thus, researchers are
currently seeking TRAIL sensitizers to overcome resistance to
TRAIL in cancer cells. In this report, we showed for the first time
that a flavonoid, baicalein, can up-regulate DR5 expression and
overcome TRAIL resistance in cancer cells. Baicalein has also been
reported to suppress the proliferation of various cancer cells by
causing the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (3, 28). However, in
this study, Bcl-2 protein was not changed by baicalein. The siRNA

targeting DR5, but not DR4, clearly reduced the enhancement of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by baicalein in SW480 cells, suggesting
that the sensitization of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by baicalein is
mainly due to the up-regulation of DR5 expression, which is more
important than DR4 for the TRAIL-induced apoptosis in our case.
However, slight decrease of cIAP-2 may partially contribute to the
enhancement by baicalein, because DR5 blockage cannot completely
inhibit apoptosis.
The most attractive feature of TRAIL is its tumor-selective killing,
with little or no toxicity in normal cells. Previous reports, however,
have shown that histidine-tagged TRAIL is toxic to human
hepatocytes (10, 11), and also other classical chemotherapeutic agents

are known to induce liver injury and leukocytopenia. We therefore
used human normal hepatocytes and PBMCs to examine the toxic
effect of an untagged form of TRAIL in this study. If baicalein
sensitizes normal cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, the combination
would not be valuable. To date, many agents for use with TRAIL have
been reported; however, few reports have analyzed the toxicity of such
combinations in normal cells. Indeed, histone deacetylase inhibitor,
proteasome inhibitor, and cisplatin increased cytotoxicity in
hepatocytes, as well as cancer cells in combination with TRAIL
(11, 29, 30). We showed that baicalein did not enhance TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in human PBMCs and hepatocytes. This property of
baicalein is very useful for TRAIL treatment against cancer.

Cancer Research

All of the cancer cell lines we used in the present study harbor
mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 gene. Mutations of the p53
gene exist in more than a half of all malignant tumors and confer
resistance to conventional antitumor agents (31). In addition, DR5
is a target of p53 (32). Our results indicate that baicalein induces
DR5 expression in a p53-independent manner, and the treatment of
TRAIL with baicalein is effective even in malignant tumors with an
inactivated p53.
Baicalein is a bioactive flavonoid derived from the root of
S. baicalensis GEORGI, a traditional herbal medicine in China and
Japan. Previous reports have shown that baicalein has a growth
inhibitory effect on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (1–4). This
anticancer effect of baicalein is considered to be mainly due to
inhibition of 12-LOX activity and 12-HETE production, which play
important roles in tumor progression and metastasis (33–35).
Recent studies indicated that 12-HETE reversed baicalein-induced
apoptosis and growth inhibition (2, 3). In this study, however,
12-HETE could not block apoptosis by TRAIL and baicalein,
suggesting that DR5 up-regulation and the sensitization of TRAILinduced apoptosis by baicalein are not related to the inhibition of
12-LOX in cancer cells. As mentioned above, baicalein itself has
been considered to be an attractive anticancer agent. Our results
suggest that, when combined with TRAIL, baicalein becomes a
more powerful tool in cancer treatment.
In this report, we also showed that baicalein up-regulates CHOP
expression followed by the induction of DR5 expression in SW480
cells. CHOP is involved in growth arrest and apoptosis after DNA
damage and a variety of stresses, such as nutrient deprivation,
endoplasmic reticulum stress, and anticancer agents (36–38). On
the other hand, in PC3 cells, up-regulation of DR5 expression by
baicalein primarily depends on an increase of the intracellular ROS
level. Catalase could effectively attenuate the increase, indicating
that the intracellular ROS produced by baicalein include H2O2.
However, catalase could not completely block the up-regulation of
DR5 and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by baicalein,
suggesting that other ROS or molecules may be related to the
phenomena in PC3 cells. Although several previous reports
indicated that ROS induce CHOP expression (39, 40), the CHOP

level in SW480 was increased by 40 Amol/L baicalein without an
increase in the intracellular ROS level, indicating that the upregulation of CHOP expression in SW480 cells occurs independent
of the ROS induced by baicalein.
From our knowledge, this is the first report that an agent
sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL through different cell-specific
pathways. As mentioned in Fig. 6D, baicalein induces DR5
expression and overcomes TRAIL resistance dependent on CHOP
induction in cancer cells, such as SW480. Even if the level of CHOP
expression is low, baicalein generates ROS and consequently
facilitates DR5 up-regulation and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
cancer cells, such as PC3. Although TRAIL-resistant cancer cells
escape TRAIL surveillance, baicalein can trigger two cellular stress
pathways in different types of cancer cells and expose cancer cells
to TRAIL by the double check systems. Oncogenic stress involving
the activation of Ras and overexpression of Myc can up-regulate
DR5 expression (41, 42). Taken together, DR5 acts as a stress sensor
in cancer cells and consequently exposes cancer cells to TRAIL
surveillance. In addition, baicalein facilitates stress in cancer cells
and stimulates the DR5 sensor. Recently, DR5 deficiency in mice
has been reported to promote tumorigenesis (43, 44). These results
support our consideration.
In conclusion, we showed that baicalein overcomes TRAIL
resistance through the up-regulation of DR5 expression via two
cell-specific pathways, ROS induction and CHOP up-regulation,
with low toxicity in normal cells. Baicalein may be useful to
increase TRAIL efficacy in the treatment of malignant tumors.
