Summary
Amplification of MYCN is a driver mutation in a subset of human neuroendocrine tumors
including neuroblastoma. No small molecules that target N-Myc, the protein encoded by MYCN,
are clinically available. N-Myc forms a complex with the Aurora-A kinase, which protects N-Myc
from proteasomal degradation. Although stabilization of N-Myc does not require the catalytic
activity of Aurora-A, we show here that two Aurora-A inhibitors, MLN8054 and MLN8237,
disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex and promote degradation of N-Myc mediated by the Fbxw7
ubiquitin ligase. Disruption of the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex inhibits N-Myc-dependent
transcription, correlating with tumor regression and prolonged survival in a mouse model of

MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. We conclude that Aurora-A is an accessible target that makes
destabilization of N-Myc a viable therapeutic strategy.

Introduction
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Deregulated expression of MYC, MYCL or MYCN, which encode c-Myc, L-Myc, and NMyc, respectively, contributes to the genesis of multiple human tumors. Amplification of
MYCN is found in neuroendocrine tumors including neuroblastoma, small cell lung
carcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (Beltran et al., 2011; Brodeur et al., 1984;
Kim et al., 2006). Deregulated expression of MYCN also occurs in tumors lacking MYCN
amplification, since MYCN is downstream of several oncogenic signal transduction
pathways (Valentijn et al., 2012). Paradigmatic examples are mutations in the sonic
hedgehog pathway that drive a subset of human medulloblastomas and lead to constitutively
elevated expression of MYCN (Hatton et al., 2006; Kawauchi et al., 2012).
Similar to c-Myc, the N-Myc protein is a DNA binding helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper
protein that forms an obligate heterodimer with a partner protein termed Max (Wenzel et al.,
1991). Both the interface between the two subunits and the interface between the dimer and
the DNA sequences it bound are extensive, and currently no small-molecule inhibitors that
target the heterodimeric complex are clinically available. Since N-Myc binds to a large set
of target genes, defining critical oncogenic effector pathways that can be targeted for
therapeutic intervention is also difficult (Chen et al., 2008).

Like c-Myc, N-Myc is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. One ubiquitin ligase
that targets N-Myc for proteasomal degradation is Fbxw7, which recognizes N-Myc upon
phosphorylation at both S62 and T58 (Sjostrom et al., 2005). The mitotic kinase cyclin B/
CDK1 phosphorylates S62, thereby priming phosphorylation at T58 by GSK3β. As a result,
N-Myc is specifically degraded during mitosis (Sjostrom et al., 2005). This mechanism is
thought to enable cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitor cells and to “reset”
N-Myc levels before the start of the next cell cycle.
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells express elevated levels of Aurora-A, a kinase that is
expressed and active during G2 and mitosis (Marumoto et al., 2005; Otto et al., 2009).
Aurora-A associates with N-Myc and prevents Fbxw7-mediated proteasomal degradation of
N-Myc. MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells depend on high levels of Aurora-A
expression for maintaining N-Myc function (Otto et al., 2009). Similarly, Aurora-A and NMyc bind each other and together drive an oncogenic gene expression program in
neuroendocrine prostate tumors (Beltran et al., 2011). Neither complex formation with nor
stabilization of N-Myc requires the catalytic activity of Aurora-A. As a result, several
Aurora kinase inhibitors have no discernible effect on N-Myc turnover (Otto et al., 2009).
However, complex formation requires the kinase domain of Aurora-A and some of the
available inhibitors of Aurora-A induce an unusually distorted conformation of this domain,
in which the transactivation loop (featuring an Asp(D)-Phe(F)-Gly(G) sequence) adopts an
apparently non-physiological conformation (“DFG-up”) (Dodson et al., 2010; Sloane et al.,
2010). The goal of this study was to test the effect of such inhibitors on N-Myc expression

We showed previously that Aurora-A forms a complex with N-Myc in MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cells, which protects N-Myc from proteasomal degradation in mitosis (Otto
et al., 2009). This activity was specific for Aurora-A, since neither enhanced expression of
Aurora-B nor siRNA-mediated depletion of Aurora-B affected N-Myc protein levels (Figure
S1A,B). Stabilization of N-Myc does not require the catalytic activity of Aurora-A (Otto et
al., 2009). However, recent crystallographic work shows that the Aurora-A-specific inhibitor
MLN8054 (Manfredi et al., 2007) induces a “DFG-up” conformation, in which multiple
residues have an altered position relative to ATP-bound Aurora-A, raising the possibility
that MLN8054 disrupts the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex (Dodson et al., 2010; Sloane et al.,
2010). This result prompted us to test whether MLN8054 might affect N-Myc stability. We
therefore treated MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma IMR-32 and IMR-5 cells with increasing
concentrations of MLN8054 (Manfredi et al., 2007). Treatment with MLN8054 abolished
autophosphorylation of Aurora-A at Thr288 (T288) and caused a concentration-dependent
decrease in N-Myc protein levels (Figure 1A). Treatment of three additional MYCNamplified neuroblastoma lines also decreased N-Myc protein levels (Figure 1B, S1C). In all
cell lines, the decrease in N-Myc levels was apparent after 24 hr of treatment (Figure S1C).
In 4/5 lines, there was a further decrease between 24 and 48 hr (compare Figures 1B, 48 hr,
with S1C, 24 hr). MLN8054 abolished autophosphorylation of Aurora-A at T288, but had
no consistent effects on the autophosphorylation of Aurora-B and -C, consistent with it
being a specific Aurora-A inhibitor at the concentrations used here (Figures 1B, S1C).
Furthermore, MLN8054 did not significantly alter expression of GSK3β and
phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 (Figures S1C,G). This observation is consistent with the
lack of effect of either overexpression or siRNA-mediated depletion of Aurora-A on GSK3β
phosphorylation, and argues that Aurora-A does not affect N-Myc stability via effects on
GSK3β or its upstream regulators (Figures S1D,E) (Faisal et al., 2011). Similarly, incubation
of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines with the clinical lead compound MLN8237
that is structurally closely related to MLN8054, decreased N-Myc protein levels, arguing
that this is not an off-target effect of MLN8054 (Figure S1F) (Manfredi et al., 2011).
Treatment with MLN8054 or MLN8237 had little effect on MYCN mRNA levels and
decreased levels of N-Myc expressed from a heterologous promoter in SH-EP
neuroblastoma cells, demonstrating that both compounds decrease N-Myc levels via a posttranscriptional mechanism (Figures 1C and S1G,H). In normal neuronal progenitors, N-Myc
is degraded in G2/M, since degradation is initiated by phosphorylation by cyclin B/CDK1
(Sjostrom et al., 2005). FACS experiments showed that approximately 70% of IMR-32 cells
accumulated in G2/M upon treatment with MLN8054 or MLN8237 for 24 hr (Figure S1F).
Under these conditions, measurements of N-Myc stability by blockade of new protein
synthesis using cycloheximide showed that MLN8054 accelerated the turnover of
approximately 70% of total N-Myc protein, whereas the remaining pool of N-Myc was more
stable (Figures 1 D,E). Similarly, pulse-chase experiments showed that about half of newly
synthesized, endogenous N-Myc protein was rapidly degraded in the presence of MLN8054

in IMR-32 cells (Figures 1 F,G). The same result was obtained using MLN8237 (Figure
S1I). Furthermore, MLN8054 destabilized the ectopically expressed N-Myc protein in SHEP cells (Figure S1J). Finally, the effect of MLN8054 was reverted by addition of the
proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Figure 1H). We concluded that MLN8054 and MLN8237
stimulate degradation of N-Myc by the proteasome. The data also suggest that MLN8054
selectively destabilizes a pool of N-Myc that is sensitive to degradation by Fbxw7 in
mitosis; this hypothesis is tested below.

Destabilization of N-Myc might be either an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest in
G2/M due to inhibition of the catalytic activity of Aurora-A or a specific effect of MLN8054
or MLN8237 on Aurora-A/N-Myc complexes. To discern between these possibilities, we
compared the effect of different Aurora-A inhibitors on N-Myc levels, N-Myc/Aurora-A
complexes and cell cycle progression. Addition of MLN8054 or MLN8237 decreased the
amount of Aurora-A that co-immunoprecipitated with N-Myc when either compound was
added to IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to
block degradation of N-Myc (Figures 2A,B). Conversely, about 1% of total N-Myc was
recovered in Aurora-A immunoprecipitates from IMR-32 cells and incubation with
MLN8237 in the presence of MG132 reduced this amount (Figure 2C). In contrast,
MLN8054 had no effect on the amount of Max that bound to N-Myc, demonstrating that it
specifically disrupts the N-Myc/Aurora-A complex (Figure 2A). Proximity ligation assays
revealed that the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex is present in the nucleus and in the cytosol of
virtually all interphase cells and showed that both MLN8237 and MLN8054 decreased the
amount of the complex by approximately 80%, consistent with the results obtained in
immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 2D and data not shown) (Gullberg et al., 2003).
MLN8054 also decreased the amount of N-Myc bound to Aurora-A when the immunopurified complex was incubated with the compound in vitro, demonstrating that MLN8054
acts directly on the complex (Figure S2A).
As expected from inhibition of the Aurora A kinase activity, two selective Aurora-A
inhibitors with dissimilar chemical structures, MK5108 and CCT137690, also induced
accumulation of IMR-32 cells in the G2/M phase to the same extent as MLN8054 and
MLN8237 (Figure S1F) (Seki et al., 2008). Unlike MLN8054 and MLN8237, however,
neither MK5108, CCT137690 nor the pan-Aurora inhibitor Hesperadin disrupted the
Aurora-A/N-Myc complex (Figures 2 D,E,F, S2B) (Faisal et al., 2011; Shimomura et al.,
2010). Importantly, extensive titrations of MLN8054, MLN8237 and MK5108 in multiple
cell lines showed that the ability to dissociate the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex correlated with
the ability to decrease N-Myc levels (Figure S2C). We concluded that destabilization of NMyc requires dissociation of Aurora-A/N-Myc complexes by MLN8054 or MLN8237.
Titration of MLN8054 and MLN8237 revealed that the IC50 values for decrease in N-Myc
levels and for dissociation of the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex are significantly higher than the
concentration required for inhibition of the autophosphorylation of Aurora-A at T288
(Figures 2B,F, S2C, S3A,B). Assuming that the accessibility of the Aurora-A/N-Myc
complex is equal to that of free Aurora-A, this difference might reflect the additional energy
required to disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex. Alternatively, this elevated IC50 value
reflects an off-target effect of the drug. To distinguish between these possibilities, we

expressed doxycycline-inducible alleles of either wild-type Aurora-A or Aurora-AT217D, a
mutant allele that has a reduced affinity towards MLN8054, in MYCN-amplified SMS-KCN
neuroblastoma cells (Sloane et al., 2010). Addition of MLN8054 suppressed colony
formation of control cells and of cells expressing wild-type Aurora-A (Figure 3A). In
contrast, cells that expressed Aurora-AT217D were capable of colony formation in the
presence of MLN8054, and Aurora-A kinase remained active under these conditions (Figure
3A,B). Importantly, cells expressing Aurora-AT217D maintained elevated N-Myc levels in
the presence of MLN8054, in contrast to control cells or cells expressing wild-type AuroraA (Figure 3B). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the N-Myc/AuroraAT217D complex remained stable in the presence of MLN8054 (Figure 3C). As an
additional control to demonstrate that the ability to inhibit N-Myc expression is an on-target
activity of MLN8054, we used a small series of structurally related compounds with wellcharacterized affinities towards Aurora-A. The ability of these compounds to affect N-Myc
expression paralleled their inhibition of Aurora-A, further supporting the notion that
MLN8054 and structurally related compounds regulate N-Myc levels via dissociation of an
Aurora-A/N-Myc complex (Figure 3D).

A key ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination of N-Myc is Fbxw7 (Welcker et al.,
2004; Yada et al., 2004). Fbxw7 recognizes N-Myc after sequential phosphorylation at S62
by cyclin B/CDK1, which primes N-Myc for phosphorylation at T58 by GSK3β (Sjostrom et
al., 2005; Yeh et al., 2004). Consequently, Fbxw7 does not recognize a mutant allele of NMyc, which carries alanine substitutions at both residues (N-MycT58AS62A=N-Mycmut)
(Sjostrom et al., 2005). This mutant is neither bound nor stabilized by Aurora-A, suggesting
that Aurora-A specifically antagonizes degradation by Fbxw7 (Otto et al., 2009). Consistent
with these observations, MLN8054 decreased levels of ectopically expressed N-Myc, but
not N-Mycmut, in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells that do not express endogenous N-Myc
(Figure 4A). Depletion of Fbxw7 in IMR-32 cells enhanced steady-state levels of
endogenous N-Myc and abolished the MLN8054-induced decrease in N-Myc levels whereas
depletion of HectH9/Huwe1, another ubiquitin ligase that is involved in ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of N-Myc had no significant effect (Figure 4B). Importantly, depletion of
Fbxw7 stabilized N-Myc and reverted the enhanced turnover of N-Myc in the presence of
MLN8054 (Figure 4C,D). Note that depletion of HectH9/Huwe1 is not complete, therefore
we cannot rule out a contribution of residual HectH9/Huwe1 to N-Myc turnover in response
to MLN80454.
Addition of MLN8054 for 24 hr destabilized about 50-70% of total N-Myc protein,
suggesting that a specific pool of N-Myc is sensitive to MLN8054; this corresponds to the
fraction of cells that are in G2/M upon inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, overall levels of NMyc decreased progressively over 24-48 hr in response to MLN8054, suggesting that
MLN8054 might destabilize N-Myc when cells have progressed to G2 and M phase (Figures
4E,F). Degradation of N-Myc by Fbxw7 is initiated by the mitotic kinase, cyclin B/CDK1
(Sjostrom et al., 2005). As a result, depletion of Aurora-A strongly affects N-Myc levels in
cells synchronized in mitosis by addition of nocodazole; degradation is further enhanced by
inhibition of PI3-kinase, which activates GSK3β to phosphorylate T58 of N-Myc (Otto et
al., 2009). Similarly, addition of MLN8054 enhanced N-Myc turnover in response to PI3-

kinase inhibition by LY294002 in nocodazole-treated cells (Figure 4G). The same result was
obtained using the dual PI3-kinase/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235 (not shown). The data strongly
suggest that Aurora-A protects N-Myc from Fbxw7-mediated degradation during mitosis
and that the slow kinetics of decrease is due to the requirement for mitotic phosphorylation
of N-Myc.

Incubation with MLN8054 suppressed colony formation and inhibited proliferation of all
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines that we tested (Figures 5A, and S4A). IC50 values
for suppression of proliferation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma lines range between 250
nM and 700 nM, consistent with the possibility that downregulation of N-Myc contributes to
growth inhibition (Shang et al., 2009). FACSscan experiments showed that the predominant
response of MYCN-amplified SMS-KCN cells to treatment with MLN8054 was a delay in
progression through both the G1 and the G2 phase of the cell cycle, similar to the response
elicited by shRNA-mediated depletion of Aurora-A (Figure 5B)(Otto et al., 2009).
Prolonged incubation with MLN8054 also induced varying degrees of apoptosis in MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell lines (Figure 5B and data not shown). While the delay in
progression through G2 is likely to reflect catalytic functions of Aurora-A in mitotic entry
(see above), we speculated that the delay in progression through G1 phase may depend on
degradation of N-Myc. Consistent with previous observations that N-Myc represses
expression of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A (encoding p21Cip1) (Herold et al., 2002),
incubation with MLN8054 induced a significant increase in expression of CDKN1A in 4/5
MYCN-amplified cell lines tested (Figure 5C). Induction of CDKN1A in response to
MLN8054 was independent of p53 status, since it also occurred in LAN-1 cells that do not
express detectable p53 and, to a lesser degree, in Kelly cells (Figure 5C) and since it was not
blocked by expression of a dominant-negative allele of p53 (Figures S4B, S4C). Ectopic
expression of N-Myc or N-Mycmut in MYCN-amplified cells attenuated induction of
CDKN1A, arguing that elimination of MYCN is required for induction of CDKN1A
expression (Figure 5D). Note that the ectopically expressed N-Myc protein was not
completely degraded in the presence of MLN8054 in these experiments (Figure 5E).
Identical results were obtained in SHEP cells ectopically expressing or N-Myc or N-Mycmut
(Figure 4A). Importantly, ectopic expression of N-Myc and N-Mycmut provided a moderate
proliferative advantage to MYCN-amplified cells in the absence of MLN8054, but a much
stronger advantage in the presence of MLN8054 (SMS-KCN cells: Figure 5F; IMR-5 cells:
data not shown). This correlated with their ability to suppress MLN8054-induced expression
of p21Cip1 (Figure 5G). We concluded that elimination of N-Myc is required for the
complete arrest of cell proliferation and for induction of p21Cip1 expression by MLN8054 in
cultured MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.
Murine Aurora-A binds to the human N-Myc protein (Figure S5A), allowing us to use the
TH-MYCN mouse model of aggressive neuroblastoma, in which high-level expression of
MYCN is driven in neural crest by a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, to evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of MLN8054 and MLN8237 in an in vivo setting (Weiss et al., 1997).
Mice with large established tumors were initially treated with daily oral administration of 40
mg/kg MLN8054. After three days of treatment, immunoblots revealed a large decrease in
N-Myc protein in 4/6 and a modest decrease in 2/6 tumors in comparison to vehicle-treated

tumors (Figure 6A). Treatment with 30 mg/kg MLN8237 induced more rapid decreases in
tumor volume (p=0.022; Figure S5B) and downregulation of N-Myc was observed in 8/8
tumors after 24 hr (p=0.0023; Figure S5C). Downregulation of N-Myc occurred
posttranslationally, since levels of human and mouse MYCN mRNA were unaffected by
MLN8054 or MLN8237 (Figure S5D). To test whether MLN8054 affects the amount of NMyc bound to its target sites in vivo, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiments from three vehicle- and three MLN8054-treated mice. These experiments
revealed that N-Myc specifically bound to the E-box of the APEX promoter, a wellcharacterized target gene of N-Myc, and that treatment with MLN8054 strongly reduced
binding to this site (Figure 6B). Identical results were obtained for the Myc-binding sites
localized in the NCL1 and SLC25A19 genes (not shown). To determine how the observed
decreases in N-Myc affect the transcriptional functions of N-Myc, we used microarrays to
compare gene expression profiles of four MLN8054-treated against four vehicle treated
tumors. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed strong modulation of expression of
multiple Myc target gene sets in response to MLN8054, demonstrating that MLN8054
interferes with N-Myc-dependent transcription in vivo (Figure 6C) (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The prognostic relevance of gene sets regulated by MLN8054 was investigated in a
cohort of 476 primary neuroblastomas representing the entire spectrum of the disease
(Oberthuer et al., 2010). Prognostic classifiers based on MLN8054-regulated gene sets were
generated in a training set comprising approximately half of the total cohort, and their
classification performance was evaluated in the remaining test set. Importantly, we observed
that gene sets regulated by MLN8054 in the mouse model were strongly associated with
both overall (Figure 6D) and event-free survival (S5E) of neuroblastoma patients. We
concluded that treatment with MLN8054 interferes with critical oncogenic functions of NMyc in vivo.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

GSEA analysis also provided evidence that MLN8054 reduced expression of genes that are
characteristic of pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that MLN8054 limits the self-renewal
capacity of neuroblastoma cells (Figure S5F) (Wong et al., 2008). In support of this
contention, treatment with MLN8054 abolished the ability of IMR-5 cells to grow as
neurospheres in culture (Figure S5G). MLN8054 also downregulated N-Myc, abolished
clonogenic growth and induced expression of neurofilament protein L mRNA (NEFL), a
marker of differentiation, in a primary neurosphere culture derived from a patient with bone
marrow metastasis, supporting the notion that MLN8054 results extend to the human disease
(Figures S5H,I).
Analysis of tumor volume response by MRI revealed complete response rates around 50%
for both compounds (Figures 7A,B, S6A,B: MLN8054: 4/9 complete responses; MLN8237:
5/8 complete responses). Histological analysis of tumors recovered from mice after one
(MLN8237) or three days (MLN8054) of treatment revealed highly significant increases in
mitotic activity, with neuronal differentiation consistent with partial maturation of tumors,
and inflammatory infiltrates (Figures 7C, S6C). There were also prominent sheets of foamy
histiocytes, indicative of inflammation. Immunohistological analysis showed that both drugs
increased the percentage of cells staining positively for phosphoH3, indicative of an
accumulation in G2 and mitosis (Figures 7D, S6C; quantification of staining is in Figure

S6D for MLN8054 and S6E for MLN8237). In addition, there was a decrease in N-Myc
staining intensity, supporting the immunoblot data. Consistent with the reduction of
clonogenic growth observed in vitro, treatment with MLN8054 increased the number of
cells staining positively for the senescence marker H3K9me and decreased expression of
Bmi1, which is critical for the self-renewal of neuronal progenitor cells (Bruggeman et al.,
2005). Neither MLN8054 nor MLN8237 induced a significant increase in apoptotic cells.
Finally, treatment with MLN8054 induced infiltration of immune cells, including
macrophages (stained with Mac2) and T-lymphocytes (Figure 7D and data not shown).
Exposure of tumor-bearing mice to 40 mg/kg MLN8054 resulted in rapid tumor regression.
However, this high dose was not tolerated well in long-term experiments, which
complicated the interpretation of survival studies (not shown). A lower split dose of 15
mg/kg twice daily was well tolerated, significantly extended survival (p=0.0016) and
decreased N-Myc levels in vivo (Figures 7E, S6F). Treatment with MLN8237 was well
tolerated and resulted in a more pronounced extension of survival (Figure 7F; p=0.0004). In
similar trials, neither MK5108 nor CCT137690 had significant effects on survival, tumor
growth or N-Myc levels (data not shown). However, mass spectrometry and immunoblots of
Aurora-AT288P revealed that effective intratumoral levels of either compound were variable
even at high oral doses, precluding a definitive assessment of their efficacy. Taken together,
our data show that both MLN8054 and MNL8237 effectively destabilize the N-Myc protein,
cause a blockade of N-Myc function and achieve significant therapeutic benefit in this in
vivo model of neuroblastoma.

Discussion

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The N-Myc protein differs from the founding member of the family, c-Myc, in that
degradation of N-Myc is initiated via phosphorylation by cyclin B/CDK1 and therefore
tightly linked to mitosis (Sjostrom et al., 2005). The mitotic degradation of N-Myc is
thought to allow cell cycle exit and differentiation of neuroblasts. In human neuroblastoma
cells, Aurora-A forms a complex with the N-Myc protein that stabilizes N-Myc in mitosis,
thereby maintaining neuroblastoma cells in a proliferative state (Otto et al., 2009). We show
here that MLN8237 and MLN8054 disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex. Phosphorylation
of N-Myc by cyclin B/CDK1 initiates ubiquitination of N-Myc by Fbxw7 (Welcker et al.,
2004; Yada et al., 2004). Consistently, we found that Fbxw7 is required for degradation of
N-Myc in response to disruption of the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex. The exact mechanism by
which complex formation of N-Myc with Aurora-A prevents degradation of N-Myc is
currently unknown. Notably, approximately 1% of N-Myc was recovered in Aurora-A
immunoprecipitates, arguing that Aurora-A does not act by sterically blocking the access of
Fbxw7 to N-Myc. Rather, we suggest that Aurora-A recruits a stabilizing activity; possible
candidates are a S62 phosphatase such as PP2A or a de-ubiquitinating enzyme such as
Usp28 (Horn et al., 2007; Popov et al., 2007) (Figure 8).
In response to MLN8054 or MLN8273, N-Myc levels decreased progressively over a 24-48
hr time period, which cannot be explained by the short half-life of N-Myc. Proximityligation assays showed that the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex is detectable in virtually all cells.
We propose, therefore, that the slow kinetics of N-Myc degradation reflects the need for

cyclin B/CDK1 to phosphorylate N-Myc in mitosis. Since inhibition of the catalytic activity
of Aurora-A delays entry into mitosis (Seki et al., 2008), we suggest that purely allosteric
inhibitors of Aurora-A, which disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex but do not inhibit the
catalytic activity of Aurora-A, may have a more rapid impact on N-Myc levels.

Treatment with MLN8054 broadly inhibits N-Myc dependent transcription in vivo. Genes
that are downregulated in response to MLN8054 are prognostically significant in human
neuroblastoma. They include genes that mediate oncogenic functions of Myc and that in turn
have been proposed to be therapeutic targets for Myc-dependent tumors, such as ODC1 and
CDK4 (Miliani de Marval et al., 2004; Nilsson et al., 2005). In addition, treatment of
neuroblastomas with MLN8054 or MLN8237 induces senescence and differentiation as well
as infiltration of immune cells, phenotypes that are thought to mediate tumor regression in
response to inhibition of Myc in regulatable mouse tumor models (Rakhra et al., 2010; Sodir
et al., 2011). Consistent with induction of senescence, MLN8054 diminishes expression of
Bmi1, which is a critical regulator of stem cell functions, and represses a stem cell-specific
gene expression program. We suggest that these effects contribute to the ability of
MLN8054 and MLN8237 to prolong survival in the N-Myc dependent mouse model of
neuroblastoma. This remains to be formally proven, since MK5103 and CCT137690, which
did not disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex in culture and did not affect survival in the
TH-MYCN model, did not consistently accumulate to high enough concentrations in the
tumor tissue to allow definitive conclusions about their therapeutic efficacy. Similarly, it
remains possible that the decrease in N-Myc levels observed in vivo occurs via a mechanism
that is different from Fbxw7-mediated degradation.

MLN8237 is currently in phase 2 clinical evaluations for childhood neuroblastoma
(NCT01154816). The plasma concentration of the drug in these trials is around 2 μM, which
is sufficient to disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex (Matulonis et al., 2012). The
identification of N-Myc as a critical target of this class of Aurora-A inhibitors suggests
rational strategies for further therapy development. For example, structural considerations
suggest that it is possible to optimize inhibitors to more strongly distort the Aurora-A
structure and thereby more effectively disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex. As described
above, allosteric drugs can be envisaged that disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex while
retaining the ability of Aurora-A to promote entry into mitosis, potentially leading to more
rapid phosphorylation and degradation of N-Myc. Furthermore, degradation of N-Myc in
response to MLN8054 is enhanced by inhibition of PI3-kinase, which promotes
phosphorylation of N-Myc at T58 and has therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of
neuroblastoma (Chanthery et al., 2012). Similarly, small molecules targeting Brd4 allow
inhibition of transcription from the MYCN promoter, so combinations with either drug may
further decrease N-Myc protein levels below critical thresholds (Delmore et al., 2011). Our
findings therefore also offer strategies to develop future combination therapies for MYCNamplified neuroblastoma and potentially other N-Myc dependent tumors.

Experimental Procedures
Tissue culture

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Neuroblastoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum. The primary neuroblastoma sphere culture was established
from a highly infiltrated bone marrow aspirate of a neuroblastoma patient. Informed consent
was obtained from the patient according to a research proposal approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg. Cells were seeded in
neurosphere medium (Neurobasal A, Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
B27 serum substitute (Gibco Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml bFGF (Promokine, Heidelberg,
Germany), 20 ng/ml bFGF (Promokine), and 2 μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany) and were cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2. For colony assays, cells were fixed with
70% ethanol and stained with crystal violet. FACS analysis was performed using propidium
iodide staining of ethanol-fixed cells via FACSCantoII™(BD) flow cytometer.
In vivo experiments

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All experimental protocols were monitored and approved by The Institute of Cancer
Research Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body, in compliance with guidelines
specified by the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the United
Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute guidelines for the welfare of animals in cancer
research (Workman et al., 2010). Transgenic TH-MYCN mice were genotyped to detect the
presence of human MYCN transgene (Weiss et al., 1997). After weaning, animals were
palpated for intra-abdominal tumors twice weekly. Mice with palpable tumors (40-80 days
old) were treated with the indicated doses of MLN8054, MLN8237 or vehicle. For the
MLN8054 and MLN8237 experiments shown in Figures 7E-F, mice were treated with
indicated dose twice a day for five days, then treatment was stopped for two days before the
schedule resumed, for 2 weeks. Drugs were administered via oral gavage. Mice were
allowed access to food and water ad libitum.
In vivo imaging and histopathology
MRI was performed on a 7T horizontal bore micro-imaging system (Bruker Instruments)
using a 3 cm birdcage coil. Anatomical T2-weighted coronal images were acquired from 20
contiguous 1 mm thick slices through the mouse abdomen, from which tumor volumes were
determined using segmentation from regions of interest drawn on each tumor-containing
slice. At the end of trials, tumors were dissected, divided into 6 approximately equal pieces,
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin or specific antibodies. Immunohistochemistry was
performed using standard methods by Histopathox Ltd. Briefly, 5 μm sections were stained
with antibodies, including heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6) or
EDTA buffer and scored by a consultant histopathologist.
Immunological methods
Tumor or spleen tissue were homogenized using T-PER buffer™ (Thermo Scientific)
containing 1× complete proteinase inhibitor tablet (Roche) per 10ml buffer and a cocktail of

phosphatase inhibitors (Santa Cruz). Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay.
Protein (30 μg) was denatured in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), separated on pre-cast
4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots
were recorded electronically on a Fujifilm LAS-4000 scanner. To measure N-Myc stability,
IMR-32 and SH-EP cells were pulsed for 30 min with 35S-labeled methionine and chased
for 0, 15, 30 or 60 min: alternatively, new protein synthesis was blocked by addition of 100
μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were lysed with NP40 buffer, adjusted to equal incorporation
and N-Myc was immunoprecipitated using DYNAbeads. Immunoprecipitations lacking a
primary antibody or with control antibodies were used as controls for specificity.
Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described in (Bouchard et
al., 2001). Antibodies are listed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Gene expression analyses
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random hexanucleotide primers and
M-MLV reverse transcriptase. qRT-PCR was performed in triplicates with cDNA
corresponding to 40 ng total RNA using Absolute™ QPCR SYBR Green mix (ABgene) on
the Mx3000P™ system (Stratagene) at 60°C annealing temperature. Relative expression was
calculated according to the ΔΔCt relative quantification method using the average
expression of RPS14 and B2M as calibrator. Primers are listed in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Duolink insitu PLA (Olink Bioscience) was performed on fixed adherent cells according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, SH-EP neuroblastomas cells expressing N-Myc
were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100,
blocked with the manufacturer’s blocking agent for 1 hour followed by incubation with
paired primary antibodies, N-Myc (Calbiochem) with Aurora-A (Cell Signaling) or Max
(Cell Signaling) for 1 hour. PLA detection was performed as recommended by the
manufacturer. Images were taken and analyzed using the InCell Analyzer 1000 (Plan 20 ×
objective).

Significance

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Multiple previous studies suggest that targeting members of the Myc family of
oncoproteins will have significant therapeutic benefit in human tumors. Deregulated
expression of N-Myc, one of the three Myc family members, is prevalent in both
pediatric and adult neuroendocrine tumors. We show here that it is possible to target NMyc indirectly using small molecules that disrupt the interaction between N-Myc and the
Aurora-A kinase, which is critical for stabilizing N-Myc. In a mouse model of
neuroblastoma, such inhibitors induce differentiation and senescence in tumors and
achieve significant therapeutic benefit.

(B) FACS analysis showing cell cycle phases of SMS-KCN cells in response to MLN8054
(250 nM; 48 hr) (left). The data were combined with the growth curve shown in panel (A) to
calculate the length of each cell cycle phase (right). Error bars indicate SD of triplicate
biological replicates.
(C) The graph shows levels of CDKN1A mRNA relative to β2-microglobulin and RPS14 as
control determined by qRT-PCR. The indicated cell lines were incubated with MLN8054
(1000 nM) or DMSO for 48 hr before RNA was prepared. Error bars indicate SD of
triplicate technical replicates from one of two experiments with identical results.
(D) LAN-1 cells were stably transduced with lentiviruses expressing either wild-type N-Myc
or N-Mycmut and the experiment performed as described in panel C. Error bars indicate SD
of triplicate technical replicates.
(E) Immunoblots documenting expression of N-Myc or N-Mycmut in LAN-1 cells exposed
to MLN8054 (1000 nM; 48 hr) or solvent control. Note that the ectopically expressed NMyc is not completely degraded in response to MLN8054.
(F) SMS-KCN cells were infected with either control viruses (empty) or retroviruses
expressing N-Myc or N-Mycmut together with a GFP marker. Cells were mixed with
uninfected cells such that 20% of cells expressed GFP at the start of the experiment. The
graph shows the percentage of GFP-positive cells during culture in the absence or presence
of MLN8054 (100 nM). Error bars represent SD of triplicate biological samples. From the
data, the following doubling times can be estimated: Control cells: DMSO: 26hr; MLN8054:
36hr; N-Myc and N-Mycmut expressing cells: DMSO: 25hr; MLN8054: 32 hr (n=2).
(G) Immunoblots documenting expression of the indicated proteins at the end of the
experiment shown in panel F. Note that cells growing in the presence of MLN8054 have
selected for elevated levels of N-Myc.

Model to explain our findings.
In normal neuroblasts, degradation of N-Myc is initiated by phosphorylation at S62 of NMyc by cyclin B/CDK1; this primes N-Myc for phosphorylation by GSK3 at T58. The pool
of doubly-phosphorylated N-Myc in cells in G2/M is recognized by Fbxw7. Association of
N-Myc with Aurora-A in neuroblastoma cells blocks degradation by Fbxw7 and allows NMyc to persist into the subsequent cell cycle. MLN8237 and MLN8054 disrupt the
association, thereby restoring a more physiological pattern of N-Myc degradation.
