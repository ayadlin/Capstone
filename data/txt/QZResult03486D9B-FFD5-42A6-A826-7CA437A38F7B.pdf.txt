Abstract
The introduction of enzalutamide and abiraterone has led to
improvement in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer. However, acquired resistance to enzalutamide and
abiraterone therapies frequently develops within a short period in
many patients. In the present study, we developed enzalutamideresistant prostate cancer cells in an effort to understand the
mechanisms of resistance. Global gene-expression analysis showed
that the steroid biosynthesis pathway is activated in enzalutamideresistant prostate cancer cells. One of the crucial steroidogenic
enzymes, AKR1C3, was signiﬁcantly elevated in enzalutamideresistant cells. In addition, AKR1C3 is highly expressed in metastatic and recurrent prostate cancer and in enzalutamide-resistant
prostate xenograft tumors. LC/MS analysis of the steroid metabolites revealed that androgen precursors such as cholesterol, DHEA

and progesterone, as well as androgens are highly upregulated in
enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells compared to the
parental cells. Knockdown of AKR1C3 expression by shRNA or
inhibition of AKR1C3 enzymatic activity by indomethacin resensitized enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression
of AKR1C3 confers resistance to enzalutamide. Furthermore, the
combination of indomethacin and enzalutamide resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth. These
results suggest that AKR1C3 activation is a critical resistance
mechanism associated with enzalutamide resistance; targeting
intracrine androgens and AKR1C3 will overcome enzalutamide
resistance and improve survival of advanced prostate cancer
patients. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1413–22. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis has been well characterized as a mechanism of CRPC (9–12), but its role in enzalutamide
resistance is yet to be understood. Clinical reports have shown that
patients treated with enzalutamide have elevated testosterone
levels in the bone marrow (13, 14). A cascade of enzymes is
involved in the biosynthesis of intratumoral androgens, including
CYP17A1, HSD3B and AKR1C3. A gain-of-function mutation in
HSD3B1 (N367T) has been identiﬁed in CRPC patients recently,
and was postulated to confer resistance to enzalutamide (15, 16).
Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a multifunctional enzyme and is one of the most important genes
involved in androgen synthesis and metabolism. AKR1C3 facilitates the conversion of weak androgens androstenedione (A0
dione) and 5 a-androstanedione (5a-dione) to the more active
androgens testosterone and DHT, respectively (17, 18). It catalyzes conversion of steroids and modulates transactivation
of steroid receptors. Elevated expression of AKR1C3 has been
associated with prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness
(19, 20). The role of AKR1C3 in enzalutamide-resistant prostate
cancer is unknown.
In the present study, we developed prostate cancer cell lines
resistant to enzalutamide and found that intracrine androgen
synthesis is activated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer
cells. Activation of one of the important steroidogenic enzymes,
AKR1C3, was identiﬁed as a critical mechanism that confers
resistance to enzalutamide. Inhibition of AKR1C3 activity using
either shRNA or indomethacin resensitized enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. Furthermore, the
combination of indomethacin and enzalutamide resulted in

Targeting androgen signaling via androgen deprivation therapy
has been the mainstay of clinical interventions in prostate cancer.
Although initially effective, the majority of men experience only
transient beneﬁt and relapse with castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC), which is currently incurable. Enzalutamide, a
second-generation antiandrogen, was recently approved for the
treatment of CRPC in patients. Despite these advances that
provide temporary respite, resistance to enzalutamide occurs
frequently, and the mechanisms that contribute to resistance are
still rudimentary and are under intense investigation. Several
potential mechanisms of resistance have been revealed such as
androgen receptor (AR) variants expression (1–3) , IL6–Stat3–AR
axis activation (4), AR F876L mutation (5, 6), and glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) overexpression (7, 8).

xenograft tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture
LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, VCaP, and HEK293T cells were obtained
from the ATCC. All experiments with cell lines were performed
within 6 months of receipt from the ATCC or resuscitation
after cryopreservation. The ATCC uses short tandem repeat proﬁling for testing and authentication of cell lines. C4-2B cells were
kindly provided and authenticated by Dr. Leland Chung, CedarsSinai Medical Center (Los Angeles, CA). LN-95 cells were kindly
provided and authenticated by Dr. Joel Nelson, University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. The cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1
mg/mL streptomycin. LNCaP-neo and LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells were
generated by stable transfection of LNCaP cells with either empty
vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 encoding AKR1C3 and were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 300 mg/mL G418.
AKR1C3 shRNA (TRCN0000026561 and TRCN0000025694)
were purchased from Sigma. Cells resistant to enzalutamide were
referred to as C4-2B MDVR (C4-2B enzalutamide resistant) as
described previously (2). All cells were maintained at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed incubator with 5% carbon dioxide.

sition range was 20 to 500 Da. Analytic separations were conducted on the UPLC system using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 mm
1  150-mm analytic column kept at 50 C and at a ﬂow rate of
0.15 mL/min. The gradient started with 100% A (0.1% formic acid
in H2O) and 0% B (0.1% formic acid in CH3CN), after 2 minutes,
changed to 80% A over 2 minutes, then 45% A over 5 minutes,
followed by 20% A in 2 minutes. Finally, it was changed over 1
minute to original 100% A, resulting in a total separation time of
15 minutes. The elutions from the UPLC column were introduced
to the mass spectrometer and resulting data were analyzed and
processed using MassLynx 4.1 software.
cDNA microarray analysis
The microarray analysis has been described previously (22).
Brieﬂy, 24 hours after plating of 5  105 C4-2B parental and C4-2B
MDVR cells, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and puriﬁed with Eppendorf phase-lock-gel tube. RNA
quality of all samples was tested by RNA electrophoresis to ensure
RNA integrity. Samples were analyzed by the Genomics Shared
Resource (UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA) using the
Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST array. The data were analyzed by
Subio platform and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (23). Microarray data have been deposited in GEO with the accession number
GSE64143.

Sample preparation and analysis of steroids
The steroid extraction and analysis has been described previously (21). Brieﬂy, 50 million C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR
cells were cultured in serum- and phenol red–free RPMI-1640
medium for 5 days, then cells were suspended in 4 mL of a 1:1
water:methanol mixture. The suspension was homogenized, and
the resulting homogenate was cooled on ice. The precipitated
material was removed by centrifuging at high speed for 5 minutes,
and the supernatant was removed and evaporated in a SpeedVac
(Labconco Inc.) followed by lyophilizer (Labconco Inc.). The
residue was suspended in 150 mL of CH3OH/H2O (1:1), ﬁltered
through a 0.2 mm ultracentrifuge ﬁlter (Millipore inc.) and subjected to UPLC/MS-MS analysis. Samples were run in duplicate
during UPLC/MS-MS analysis. Samples were placed in an Acquity
sample manager, which was cooled to 8 C to preserve the analytes. Pure standards were used to optimize the UPLC/MS-MS
conditions before sample analysis. Also, the standard mixture was
run before the ﬁrst sample to prevent errors due to matrix effect
and day-to-day instrument variations. In addition, immediately
after the initial standard and before the ﬁrst sample, two spiked
samples were run to calibrate for the drift in the retention time of
all analytes due to the matrix effect. After standard and spiked
sample runs, blank was injected to wash the injector and remove
carry over effect.

Western blot analysis
Cellular protein extracts were resolved on SDSPAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking
for 1 hour at room temperature in 5% milk in PBS/0.1% Tween20, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with the indicated primary antibodies [AKR1C3 (A6229, Sigma); CYP17A1
(SC-66849, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); HSD3B (SC-28206,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology); AR (SC-815, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Tubulin (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich)]. Tubulin was used as
loading control. Following secondary antibody incubation,
immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Millipore).

UPLC/MS-MS analysis of steroid metabolites
All experiments were performed on a Waters Xevo-TQ triple
quadruple mass spectrometer (Milford) and MS and MS-MS
spectra were recorded using Electro Spray Ionization (ESI) in
positive ion (PI) and negative ion (NI) mode, capillary voltage
of 3.0 kV, extractor cone voltage of 3 V, and detector voltage of 650
V. Cone gas ﬂow was set at 50 L/h and desolvation gas ﬂow was
maintained at 600 L/h. Source temperature and desolvation
temperatures were set at 150 C and 350 C, respectively. The
collision energy was varied to optimize daughter ions. The acqui-

Measurement of PSA
PSA levels were measured in sera from C4-2B parental or C4-2B
MDVR tumor-bearing mice using the PSA ELISA Kit (KA0208,
Abnova, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
In vivo tumorigenesis assay
C4-2B parental or C4-2B MDVR cells (4 million) were mixed
with Matrigel (1:1) and injected into the prostates of 6- to 7-weekold male SCID mice. When the serum PSA level reached 5 ng/mL,
mice were randomized into two groups (4 mice in each group)
and treated as follows: (i) vehicle control (0.5% weight/volume
(w/v) Methocel A4M orally), (ii) enzalutamide (25 mg/kg, orally). Tumors were monitored by PSA level. All tumor tissues were
harvested after 3 weeks of treatment.
CWR22Rv1 cells (4 million) were mixed with Matrigel (1:1) and
injected s.c. into the ﬂanks of 6- to 7-week-old male SCID mice.
Tumor-bearing mice (tumor volume around 50–100 mm3) were
randomized into four groups (5 mice in each group) and treated as
follows: (i) vehicle control (5% Tween 80 and 5% ethanol in
PBS, i.p.), (ii) enzalutamide (25 mg/kg, orally), (iii) indomethacin
(3 mg/kg, i.p.), and (iv) enzalutamide (25 mg/kg, orally) þ
indomethacin (3 mg/kg, i.p.). Tumors were measured using calipers
twice a week and tumor volumes were calculated using length 
width2/2. Tumor tissues were harvested after 3 weeks of treatment.
Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were ﬁxed by formalin and parafﬁn-embedded tissue
blocks were dewaxed, rehydrated, and blocked for endogenous
peroxidase activity. Antigen retrieving was performed in sodium
citrate buffer (0.01 mol/L, pH 6.0) in a microwave oven at 1,000
W for 3 minutes and then at 100 W for 20 minutes. Nonspeciﬁc
antibody binding was blocked by incubating with 10% FBS in PBS
for 30 minutes at room temperature. Slides were then incubated
with anti–Ki-67 (at 1:500; NeoMarker), anti-AKR1C3 (at 1:100;
Sigma) at 4 C overnight. Slides were then washed and incubated

with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 minutes,
followed by incubation with avidin DH-biotinylated horseradish
peroxidase complex for 30 minutes (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit;
Vector Laboratories). The sections were developed with the Diaminobenzidine Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Nuclear staining cells was scored and
counted in ﬁve different vision areas. Images were taken with an
Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with DP72 camera.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means  SD of the mean. Statistical
analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel analysis tools.
Differences between individual groups were analyzed by oneway ANOVA followed by the Scheffe procedure for comparison
of means. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Identiﬁcation of AKR1C3 activation in enzalutamide-resistant
prostate cancer cells
In our previous study, we generated enzalutamide-resistant
prostate cancer cells, named C4-2B MDVR, by chronic culture of
C4-2B cells in media containing enzalutamide (2). As shown
in Fig. 1A and B, enzalutamide signiﬁcantly inhibited proliferation and clonogenic ability of C4-2B parental cells, but had little
effect on C4-2B MDVR cells. We also examined the effects of
enzalutamide treatment on C4-2B MDVR cells in vivo. As shown
in Fig. 1C, C4-2B MDVR xenografts were resistant to enzalutamide. Tumor weights of C4-2B xenograft were signiﬁcantly inhibited by enzalutamide after 3 weeks treatment with enzalutamide,
whereas tumor weights of treated C4-2B MDVR group were
comparable with those of the nontreated control group. These
results suggest that C4-2B-MDVR cells are resistant to enzalutamide both in vitro and in vivo. We also characterized several other
prostate cancer cell lines in response to enzalutamide treatment.
As shown in Fig. 1D, LNCaP cells are sensitive to enzalutamide,
whereas CWR22Rv1 and LN-95 cells are resistant to enzalutamide
treatment, consistent with previously published studies (25–27).
Intratumoral androgen biosynthesis has been well characterized as a mechanism of CRPC (9–12, 28), but its role in enzalutamide resistance remains unknown. To further understand
potential mechanisms that underlie enzalutamide resistance, we
performed microarray analysis of the enzalutamide-resistant C42B-MDVR versus C4-2B parental cells. Expression of transcripts
encoding for steroid hormone biosynthesis was analyzed by gene
set enrichment. Among 45 genes involved in hormone biosynthesis, 31 genes were upregulated whereas 14 genes were downregulated in C4-2B MDVR cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found
increased expression of AKR1C3, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, HSD3B1,
CYP17A1, and SRD5A3, and decreased expression of UGT2B15,
UGT2B17, CYP39A1, HSD17B6, and SRD5A1 in C4-2B MDVR
cells compared with C4-2B parental cells. To verify the geneexpression data, CYP17A1, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, HSD17B3,
SRD5A1, AKR1C1/2, and AKR1C3 mRNA levels were measured
using speciﬁc primers by qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B left, the
levels of mRNA expression were consistent with the microarray
data. We also conﬁrmed the results by Western blot analysis, as
shown in Fig. 2B right, C4-2B MDVR cells express signiﬁcantly
higher levels of AKR1C3, HSD3B, and CYP17A1 proteins compared with C4-2B parental cells. These results suggested that

AKR1C3 is highly expressed in metastatic prostate tumors and enzalutamide-resistant xenografts. A, C4-2B parental, C4-2B MDVR, VCaP, CWR22Rv1, LNCaP, and LN-95
cells were harvested and whole lysates were subjected to Western blotting. B, AKR1C3 expression level was analyzed by IHC staining in C4-2B parental, C4-2B
MDVR, and CWR22Rv1 xenografts. C, gene-expression analysis using the Oncomine database showing the relative expression levels of AKR1C3 in two datasets
comparing normal prostate tissue and prostate cancer. Vanaja, normal, n ¼ 8; cancer, n ¼ 32. Singh, normal, n ¼ 50; cancer, n ¼ 52. Data, mean  SE of normalized
expression units according to Oncomine output (top). AKR1C3 gene-expression analysis using the GEO database in two datasets comparing benign, primary, or
metastatic prostate cancer. GSE27616: benign, n ¼ 4; primary prostate cancer, n ¼ 5; and metastatic prostate cancer, n ¼ 4; GSE32269: primary prostate cancer, n ¼ 22;
and metastatic prostate cancer, n ¼ 29. Data were extracted and analyzed by Subio platform (bottom). D, gene-expression analysis using the Oncomine database
showed that AKR1C3 expression was correlated with prostate cancer progression and recurrence in two independent datasets (Glinsky and Singh prostate).

We performed data-mining using the Oncomine and GEO databases to compare the expression of AKR1C3 in normal prostate
and prostate cancer. Primary prostate cancer and normal prostate
express similar AKR1C3 levels in two independent prostate datasets, whereas AKR1C3 was signiﬁcantly elevated in metastatic
prostate cancer in GEO datasets (Fig. 3C), which is consistent
with the previous reports (29, 30). We further examined the
correlation between AKR1C3 and prostate cancer disease progression. As shown in Fig. 3D, AKR1C3 was signiﬁcantly correlated
with Gleason score and recurrence status in prostate cancer
patients in two independent prostate datasets in Oncomine.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that AKR1C3 is highly
expressed in late-stage prostate cancer.
Intracrine androgens are elevated in enzalutamide-resistant
prostate cancer cells
AKR1C3 (also named 17bHSD5) is one of the most important
genes involved in androgen synthesis and metabolism. AKR1C3
facilitates the conversion of weak androgens A0 dione and 5a-

www.aacrjournals.org

dione to the more active androgens, testosterone, and DHT,
respectively. To further conﬁrm that intracellular androgen synthesis was acquired by C4-2B MDVR cells, steroid metabolism in
C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells was analyzed by LC/MS.
C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells were cultured in serum-free
and phenol red–free medium for 5 days, and steroid metabolites
were extracted from 50  106 cells and subjected to LC/MS
analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A–C, C4-2B MDVR cells synthesize
extremely high levels of testosterone (131.025 vs. 0.15 pg/50
million cells), dihydrotestosterone (17.55 vs. 0 pg/50 million
cells), and DHEA (72.075 vs. 0 pg/50 million cells), compared
with C4-2B parental cells. Intriguingly, the active estrogen metabolite estradiol was signiﬁcantly reduced (82.725 vs. 207.3 pg/50
million cells) in C4-2B MDVR cells, suggesting that the biosynthesis of androgens was activated whereas transformation of
estrogen from androgens was suppressed in C4-2B MDVR cells.
Of note, the precursors involved in intracrine androgen synthesis
such as cholesterol, DHEA, and progesterone are also elevated in
C4-2B MDVR cells compared with C4-2B parental cells (Fig. 4C).

Intracrine androgens were upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. A, C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells were cultured in serum-free and
phenol red–free RPMI-1640 medium for 5 days, and levels of steroids in the cell extracts were analyzed by LC/MS. Representative testosterone and estradiol
chromatograms generated by MassLynx 4.1 software are shown. B, the difference between levels of androgen metabolites in C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells
was analyzed and quantiﬁed. C, the represented steroid metabolites between C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells were quantiﬁed. D, the androgen metabolism
pathway was upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells.

The steroidogenic enzymes involved in androgen synthesis and
metabolism are illustrated in Fig. 4D; bold arrows and bold font
indicate upregulation in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer
cells compared with C4-2B parental cells (Fig. 4D). Collectively,
these results suggest that intracrine-acquired androgen synthesis
was elevated in prostate cancer cells resistant to enzalutamide.
AKR1C3 confers resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer
cells
Having demonstrated that AKR1C3 is upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and in late-stage prostate
cancer patients, we next examined whether AKR1C3 could confer
resistance to enzalutamide. We found that AKR1C3 was sufﬁcient
to confer resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells.
CWR22Rv1 or C4-2B MDVR cells were transiently transfected
with control shRNA or AKR1C3 shRNA following treatment with
enzalutamide for 3 days. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, CWR22Rv1
and C4-2B MDVR cells are resistant to enzalutamide, whereas
knockdown of AKR1C3 expression by two independent shRNAs
(#561 and #694) restored their sensitivity to enzalutamide. The
downregulation of AKR1C3 by shRNA was conﬁrmed by Western

1418 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

blot analysis (Fig. 5C). We also generated LNCaP cells stably
expressing AKR1C3 (LNCaP-AKR1C3) to test whether exogenous
expression of AKR1C3 induces enzalutamide resistance. LNCaPAKR1C3 and LNCaP-neo vector control cells were treated with
different concentrations of enzalutamide for 48 hours and cell
numbers were counted. As shown in Fig. 5D, LNCaP-AKR1C3
cells exhibited greater resistance to enzalutamide than LNCaP-neo
cells. These results were also conﬁrmed by clonogenic ability
assay. LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells showed signiﬁcantly more clonogenic ability than the control LNCaP-neo cells in response to
enzalutamide treatment (Fig. 5E and F). Collectively, these results
demonstrate that overexpression of AKR1C3 confers resistance to
enzalutamide, whereas downregulation of AKR1C3 resensitizes
enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide
treatment.
Indomethacin, an inhibitor of AKR1C3 activity, overcomes
enzalutamide resistance
Indomethacin, an NSAID used for reducing fever, pain, and
inﬂammation, has been shown to be able to inhibit AKR1C3
activity (9, 31, 32). To further examine the role of AKR1C3 in

enzalutamide resistance, we used indomethacin to hinder
AKR1C3 activation and examined the effects on the response of
prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo.
As shown in Fig. 6A left, indomethacin did not have an effect on
CWR22Rv1 cell growth at 10 mmol/L, but inhibited cell growth
marginally at 20 mmol/L. However, combination of indomethacin with enzalutamide signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant CWR22Rv1 cells. The results were also conﬁrmed by clonogenic assay. As shown in Fig. 6A right, combination of indomethacin with enzalutamide signiﬁcantly inhibited
colony numbers and reduced colony size in CWR22Rv1 cells.
Similar results were also obtained in C4-2B MDVR cells (Fig. 6B).
To test whether inhibition of AKR1C3 by indomethacin overcomes resistance to enzalutamide treatment in vivo, CWR22Rv1
xenograft model was used. As shown in Fig. 6C, although
CWR22Rv1 tumors were resistant to enzalutamide treatment,
indomethacin signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth. Combination of indomethacin with enzalutamide further inhibited tumor
growth of CWR22Rv1 xenografts. Immunohistochemical staining
of Ki-67 showed that cell proliferation was signiﬁcantly inhibited
by indomethacin, and further inhibited by the combination
treatment (Fig. 6D). Collectively, these results suggest that inhi-

www.aacrjournals.org

bition of AKR1C3 by indomethacin reduced enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth, and that combination of enzalutamide with
indomethacin further reduced the tumor growth of enzalutamideresistant prostate cancer. These results indicate that inhibition of
AKR1C3 by indomethacin potentiates the cell killing effect of
enzalutamide.

Discussion
The second-generation androgen antagonist enzalutamide
represents an improvement in therapy options for late stage
metastatic CRPC (33, 34). However, the initial responders develop resistance inevitably. The potential mechanisms associated
with enzalutamide resistance have been the focus of intense
investigation. We previously identiﬁed several novel mechanisms
involved in enzalutamide resistance, including activation of NFkB2/p52 (27, 35), AR-V7 (2, 27), Stat3 (4), and induction of
autophagy (36). In this study, we have identiﬁed AKR1C3 activation and elevated intracrine androgens as potential mechanisms contributing to enzalutamide resistance. We demonstrate
that AKR1C3 is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant prostate
cancer cells. Overexpression of AKR1C3 confers resistance to

AKR1C3 Confers Resistance to Enzalutamide

enzalutamide, whereas downregulation of AKR1C3 sensitizes
prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment. In addition,
overexpression of AKR1C3 has been demonstrated in clinical
metastatic prostate cancer and correlated with disease progression. We also demonstrated that intracrine steroids, including
androgens are elevated in enzalutamide-resistant cells, possibly
through increased expression of steroidogenic enzymes such as
AKR1C3. We further demonstrated that indomethacin, a potent
inhibitor of AKR1C3, could be used to overcome enzalutamide
resistance. The discovery of elevated intracrine androgen synthesis
and enhanced AKR1C3 activation in enzalutamide-resistant
cells reveal a novel mechanism for the development and progression of resistant CRPC. Cotargeting AKR1C3 will provide proofof-concept experiments to overcome resistance and achieve durable responses in men with second-generation antiandrogen
treatment.
Intracrine androgen biosynthesis has been well characterized as
a mechanism of CRPC (9–12, 28). Many enzymes are involved in
androgen synthesis, including CYP17A1, AKR1C3, and HSD3B.
CYP17A1 can be inhibited by abiraterone in clinical treatments
(37, 38). AKR1C3 is a steroidogenic enzyme involved in steroid
biosynthesis and mediates the last step of testosterone biosynthesis from A0 dione. It catalyzes conversion of steroids and
modulates transactivation of steroid receptors. Elevated expression of AKR1C3 has been associated with prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness (19, 20). AKR1C3 has also been
identiﬁed as an AR coactivator (39). In this study, we used gene
enrichment analysis to compare enzalutamide-resistant cells with
enzalutamide sensitive cells, and found that the steroid biosynthesis genes were highly enriched in C4-2B MDVR cells, and
several important genes involved in androgen synthesis, such as
AKR1C3, HSD3B, and CYP17A1 were upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant cells. In another de novo enzalutamide-resistant cell
line CWR22Rv1, AKR1C3 was highly expressed compared with
C4-2B or LNCaP cells, suggesting that AKR1C3 might play a
pivotal role in enzalutamide resistance. To further conﬁrm that
intracrine androgen synthesis was acquired by C4-2B MDVR cells,
steroid levels in C4-2B parental and C4-2B MDVR cells were
determined by LC/MS. In addition to the higher levels of testosterone and DHT in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the levels of the
precursors of testosterone such as cholesterol, DHEA, and progesterone were all elevated in C4-2B-MDVR cells compared with
C4-2B parental cells. These results demonstrate that AKR1C3 was
signiﬁcantly elevated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer
cells, which potentially resulted in higher levels of testosterone
and DHT in enzalutamide-resistant cells. The de novo intratumoral
steroid synthesis has also been shown as a potential mechanism
contributing to abiraterone resistance (9). Long-term treatment
of abiraterone in patients resulted in an increase in steroids
biosynthesis through deregulated steroid enzymes, such as
AKR1C3 (40).
Several inhibitors have been developed to target AKR1C3
activation, including indomethacin (32). Indomethacin is an

NSAID used for reducing fever, pain, and inﬂammation. Several
studies revealed that indomethacin might have the potential to
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer agents, such as
that of human melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (41),
and of colon cancer cells to cisplatin (42). Indomethacin also has
the ability to inhibit PSA and ERG protein expression and
decreased testosterone and DHT levels in relapsed VCaP xenograft
tumors (9). In the present study, we showed that inhibition of
AKR1C3 enzyme activity by indomethacin restored enzalutamide
sensitivity in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of indomethacin
and enzalutamide resulted in signiﬁcantly greater inhibition of
enzalutamide-resistant tumor growth. Our data suggest that inhibition of AKR1C3 holds promise as a sensitizing strategy to restore
antitumor effects in patients resistant to enzalutamide.
Taken together, we found that AKR1C3 activation and the
resultant intracrine androgen synthesis confers resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of AKR1C3 by shRNA
or indomethacin overcomes resistance to enzalutamide. Furthermore, the combination of indomethacin and enzalutamide
resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of enzalutamide-resistant tumor
growth. Targeting AKR1C3 may provide an effective treatment
strategy for patients resistant to enzalutamide.
