Abstract

Author Manuscript

The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of transcriptional regulators are central mediators of the
cellular inflammatory response. Although constitutive NF-κB signaling is present in most human
tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block
aberrant NF-κB activity in cancer. Here, we show that more than two thirds of supratentorial
ependymomas contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NFκB signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA fusions
resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins
translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-κB target genes, and rapidly transformed
neural stem cells—the cell of origin of ependymoma—to form these tumours in mice. Our data
identify the first highly recurrent genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95RELA fusion protein as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Ependymomas are tumors of the brain and spinal cord1. Surgery and irradiation remains the
mainstay of treatment of this disease since chemotherapy is ineffective in most patients.
Consequently, ependymoma is incurable in up to 40% of cases2.
Although ependymomas from the different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) are
histological similar, they possess site-specific prognoses, transcriptional profiles and DNA
copy number alterations3–7, suggesting they are different diseases that are likely to require
different treatments. Recently, we generated the first mouse model of supratentorial
ependymoma by amplifying EPHB2 – a common DNA copy number alteration of these
tumours – in mouse forebrain NSCs6. Preclinical studies using this model have identified

new treatments that are now in clinical trial8. Drugs targeting genetic alterations in the other
types of ependymoma could provide new therapies, but the identity of these alterations
remains largely unknown.
The C11orf95-RELA translocation
To identify additional genetic alterations that drive ependymoma, we sequenced the whole
genomes (WGS) of 41 tumours and matched normal blood, and the transcriptomes
(RNAseq) of 77 tumours (Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 1; Tables S1–S3).

Single nucleotide variations, insertion/deletions, or focal (<5 genes) copy number variations
were rare in ependymomas, but structural variations (SVs) were detected relatively
frequently9, especially in supratentorial tumours (median SVs, supratentorial tumours=23
vs. posterior fossa tumours=7.5, P=0.0006, Wilcox rank; Extended Data Fig. 2a,b;
Supplementary Results; Fig. S1–S7; Tables S4–S11). All nine supratentorial ependymomas
analysed by WGS contained SVs that clustered within chromosome 11q12.1-q13.3,
producing catastrophic disruption of the locus and an oscillating copy number state
compatible with chromothripsis (chr11:50–60 Mb, FWER=9.6e−5 and chr11:60–70 Mb,
FWER=7.8e−7, Mann-Whitney Test; Fig. 1; Extended Data Figs. 2c; Supplementary Results;
Table S12)10. Although the chromothripsis region differed in each tumour, eight of the nine
cases shared a common region (~63 to ~67 Mb) in which the reordered chromosome
fragments fused a poorly characterized gene, C11orf95, to RELA, the principal effector of
canonical NF-κB signalling11,12 (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4a,b). These genes are normally
separated by 1.9Mb containing 73 genes (Extended Data Fig. 4a; Figs. S8–S10; Table S1,
S13). The C11orf95-RELA translocation was validated in all eight cases by independent
orthogonal sequencing and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using
‘break-apart’ probes to C11orf95 and RELA (Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 4c; Supplementary
Methods; Figs. S8–S9; Table S14–S15). In stark contrast, neither chromothripsis nor
C11orf95-RELA translocations were detected in any of the 32 posterior fossa tumours
analysed by WGS (P<0.0001 Fisher’s Exact).

Author Manuscript

Next, using a novel algorithm, we looked for C11orf95-RELA fusion transcripts in the 77
ependymomas analysed by RNAseq (Fig. 1; Supplementary Methods). Fusion transcripts
were validated by reverse transcriptase (rt) PCR and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2a; Extended
Data Fig. 5a). C11orf95-RELA transcripts were detected in all eight supratentorial tumours
in which the translocation was detected by WGS (Fig. 1; Table S16a). Fusion transcripts
were also detected in an additional seven supratentorial tumours: FISH detected the
C11orf95-RELA translocation in six of these with available material (Fig. 1). C11orf95RELA transcripts were not detected in supratentorial tumours that lacked the translocation or
in any posterior fossa ependymomas (Fig. 1; P<0.0001, Fisher’s Exact).
Translocation positive tumours contained mature, spliced, in-frame fusion transcripts
together with premature fusion transcripts containing intronic or intergenic DNA
breakpoints (Fig. 2a; Extended Data Figs. 4c and 6. See Supplementary Results and Fig. S10
for details of all fusion breakpoints). Thus, splicing is required to generate mature C11orf95RELA transcripts. Seven distinct, mature C11orf95-RELA fusion transcripts were observed
(Fig. 2a; Extended Data Fig. 5b). The most frequent included exons 1–2 of C11orf95 and,

except of the first two codons, the entire open reading frame of RELA (hereon, RELAFUS1;
Fig. 1 and 2a). Six other fusion transcripts (RELAFUS2-RELAFUS7) were detected less
frequently, but each was observed in tumours lacking RELAFUS1, suggesting they may be
oncogenic.
Western blotting detected wild-type RELA (RELAWT) protein in supratentorial
ependymoma ST3 and human control (293T) cells (Fig. 2b). ST3, but not control cells, also
expressed at least four RELA-proteins that corresponded to the appropriately sized products
of fusion transcripts detected in this tumour by RNAseq and rtPCR (Figs. 1 and 2b;
Extended Data Fig. 6). RELA fusion and RELAWT proteins segregated differently in ST3
cells, with fusion products accumulating preferentially in the nucleus relative to the wildtype protein.

Author Manuscript

To further validate the C11orf95-RELA translocation we analysed a separate cohort of 89
formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) ependymomas using FISH and rtPCR (Extended
Data Fig. 7; Table S1). FISH detected the C11orf95-RELA translocation in 67% (n=14/21)
of primary FFPE supratentorial ependymomas, but in none of 64 posterior fossa tumours,
and rtPCR confirmed the presence of fusion transcripts exclusively in translocation positive
tumours (p<0.0001 Fishers exact; Extended Data Fig. 7a). These data identify C11orf95RELA translocations as the most recurrent genetic alteration in ependymoma, affecting
around 70% of supratentorial tumours (n=29/41) and occurring preferentially in older
patients (mean age translocation-positive, translocation-negative supratentorial
tumours=8.3±0.9years, 3.5±1.7years, respectively; P<0.05, Mann Whitney test, Fig. 1). We
are currently interrogating a larger cohort of supratentorial ependymomas to assess the
prognostic significance of the C11orf95-RELA translocation.

Author Manuscript

RNAseq identified 20 other fusion transcripts involving 11q (Fig. 1; Fig. S11; Table
S16b,c). Thirteen occurred in tumours containing C11orf95-RELA and are predicted to be
non-coding, suggesting they are ‘passenger’ events. However, four of seven ‘coding’ fusion
transcripts occurred in ependymomas that lacked a C11orf95-RELA translocation. Two of
these fused C11orf95 to alternative transcriptional regulators: C11orf95-YAP1 and
C11orf95-MAML2 (Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 5b). Thus, the zinc finger domains of
C11orf95 are likely to be essential oncogenic elements of these fusions, possibly altering the
trafficking, degradation or target specificity of partner transcription factors.
C11orf95-RELA drives NF-κB signalling

Author Manuscript

The NF-κB family of transcriptional regulators are central mediators of the cellular
inflammatory response13. Although constitutive NF-κB signaling is present in most human
tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and
block aberrant NF-κB activity in cancer14–16. Therefore we looked to see if C11orf95RELA fusions drive aberrant NF-κB signaling in ependymoma.
RNAseq and Affymetrix gene expression profiling detected increased expression of
C11orf95 and RELA in translocation positive ependymomas, as well as high-levels of
CCND1 – a direct transcriptional target of NF-κB signalling17,18 – and L1CAM which is
associated with aberrant cell-cell adhesion, invasion, and NF-κB activation in tumours19,20

(Q<0.0001; Fig. 1). CCND1 and L1CAM protein expression were also strongly associated
with the C11orf95-RELA translocation in FFPE supratentorial ependymomas (p<0.0001,
Fisher’s Exact; Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Upstream stimuli e.g., Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF), activate the NF-κB pathway by causing RELA containing heterodimers to
translocate to the nucleus and drive gene transcription13. But RELA fusion proteins appear
to accumulate preferentially in the nucleus of ependymoma cells relative to RELAWT
protein (Fig. 2b). Therefore, we examined RELA protein trafficking in cells engineered to
express exogenous C11orf95, RELAWT or RELAFUS1 (Fig. 3a). As expected, endogenous
RELAWT was sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated control and C11orf95
transduced cells, but translocated to the nucleus to activate an NF-κB transcriptional reporter
following exposure to TNF (Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 8). Conversely, overexpression of
RELAWT resulted in spontaneous nuclear translocation and NF-κB transcription, supporting
the notion that high levels of wild-type RELA can overwhelm the IκB inhibitory system21.
Therefore, we titrated down the expression of the RELAFUS1 fusion to approximate that of
endogenous RELAWT. Even at this reduced level, RELAFUS1 translocated spontaneously to
the nucleus and activated NF-κB transcription (Fig. 3b; Extended Data Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

Next, we looked to see if C11orf95-RELA drives an aberrant NF-κB transcriptional program
in mouse NSCs that we have shown previously serve as cells-of-origin of ependymoma6
(Fig. 3c). Neither control nor C11orf95 transduction altered gene expression in NSCs; but
exogenous RELAWT upregulated 20% (n=25/129) of a series of validated NF-κB target
genes in NSCs, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) confirmed highly-significant
activation of NF-κB signaling in these cells (IPA P=4.5e-12; Supplementary Methods &
Results; Table S17). Expression of RELAFUS1 produced even greater activation of NF-κB
target genes in NSCs, and also upregulated L1cam (IPA, p=1.7e−16, Fig. 3c; Fig. S12; Table
S17). Although L1cam has been reported to activate NF-κB signaling in tumours16,17, our
NSC and tumour data suggest that it may itself be a target of aberrant C11orf95-RELA
signaling (Figs. 1, 3c; Extended Data Fig. 7b). RELAFUS1 had a profound impact on the
expression of several other genes that regulate focal adhesion, compatible with the notion
that aberrant NF-κB signaling disrupts cell-cell adhesion in cancer13,19 (Q=1.5e−10, Table
S18b).
C11orf95-RELA drives ependymoma

Author Manuscript

To test the transforming capacity of RELA fusion proteins, we isolated NSCs from
Ink4a/Arfnull Blbp-eGFP transgenic mice as described6, and transduced these with either
C11orf95-Red Fluorescence Protein (C11orf95RFP), RELAWT-RFP, RELAFUS1-RFP or
RELAFUS2-RFP retroviruses. To begin to understand the relevance of the other fusions
detected in ependymoma we also implanted NSCs transduced with C11orf95-YAP1
(YAP1FUS-RFP), or wild-type YAP1 (YAPWT-RFP). 1.5x106 RFP+ NSCs transduced with
each virus were implanted separately into the cerebrum of 15 female, 6 week old, CD1-nude
mice each. C11orf95RFP, RELAWT-RFP, or YAP1WT-RFP NSCs formed very few or no brain
tumours in mice (median follow up 155 days; Fig. 4a). In stark contrast, all mice implanted
with RELAFUS1-RFP NSCs succumbed within 20 days to brain tumors that recapitulated the
‘clear cell’ and finely branched vasculature characteristic of ‘vascular-variant” human
supratentorial ependymoma22 (P<0.0001 Log-Rank; Fig. 4a; Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Similar to their human counterpart, mouse RELAFUS1 ependymomas expressed nuclear
phospho-S276-RELA that is indicative of, and required for, RELA transcriptional
activity23–25, as well as CCND1 and L1CAM (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Consistent with the
human disease, nuclei of mouse RELAFUS1 ependymomas also accumulated RELAFUS1
protein relative to the wild-type protein (Figs. 2b, 4b Extended Data Fig. 7b).
RELAFUS2-RFP NSCs also generated tumors, albeit with a lower penetrance (n=10/15 mice)
and longer latency (median survival 68 days) than RELAFUS1-RFP NSCs, potentially
explaining the biased selection of RELAFUS1 vs. RELAFUS2 in human ependymomas.
YAP1FUS-RFP NSCs formed brain tumours with high efficiency, indicating that other
ependymoma translocations are oncogenic (Fig. 4a).

Author Manuscript

Finally, to determine if C11orf95-RELA drives a specific, oncogenic NF-κB transcription
program, we compared the transcriptomes of mouse RELAFUS1-RFP brain tumours with
those of our supratentorial ependymoma mouse model driven by EPHB2 (ref.6).
RELAFUS1-RFP mouse brain tumours displayed marked upregulation of NF-κB target genes
(IPA, P=1.6e-17; Fig. 4c; Fig. S13). Conversely, EPHB2WT-RFP mouse ependymomas
expressed much lower levels of phospho-SER276-RELA, L1CAM, and CCND1 proteins
and lacked NF-κB signal activation. Thus C11orf95-RELA translocations are potent
oncogenes that most likely transform NSCs by driving an aberrant NF-κB transcription
program.

Author Manuscript

Aberrant NF-κB signalling is an established driver of solid tumours, but genetic evidence of
pathway involvement has been lacking. We identify the first, highly-recurrent genetic
alteration to activate RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-κB signalling, in human
cancer. We further show that C11orf95 is likely to be an essential partner in these
translocations, possibly disrupting the cell trafficking of RELA and other partner
transcription factors. We are currently investigating the mechanism by which RELA fusion
proteins transform NSCs, and their potential to serve as a therapeutic target.

were inspected by macroscopic dissection post-mortem. Fresh tumour cells were recovered
from mouse brains as described6.

Methods
Patient samples

Author Manuscript

Ependymomas collected under informed consent were obtained from the St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital (SJCRH) tissue resource core facility and the Children’s Oncology Group
(COG) through SJCRH and COG Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Tissue
samples were snap-frozen and / or formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) at the time
of resection. DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen tissue and peripheral blood
leukocytes. Forty-one samples were submitted for whole genome sequencing (WGS), and 77
samples underwent transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq; Table S1). An additional 89 FFPE
ependymomas were screened for structural variations (Table S1). Criteria for submission of
a tumour sample for WGS were a minimum of 5μg of tumour DNA and a minimum of 5μg
of matching peripheral white blood cell DNA. Quant-iT PicoGreen (Invitrogen) assay was
used to quantify double stranded genomic DNA for sequencing. Basic clinical data for all
patients providing tumour samples is summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Next Generation Sequencing

Author Manuscript

Whole genome sequencing—All methods employed for library construction and WGS
have been described previously (see Supplementary Information). Methods employed for
WGS mapping, coverage and quality assessment, single nucleotide variations (SNV) / indel
detection, tier annotation for sequence mutations, prediction of deleterious effects of
missense mutations, structural variations and identification of loss-of-heterozygosity have
been described (see Supplementary Information; Fig. S1–S2).
Copy number variations (CNVs) were identified by evaluating the difference of read depth
for each tumour and its matching normal DNA using the novel algorithm CONSERTING
(COpy Number SEgmentation by Regression Tree In Next-Gen sequencing, see
Supplementary Information; Fig. S3). Confidence for a CNV segment boundary was
determined using a series of criteria, including: length of flanking segments, difference of
CNV between neighboring segments, presence of sequence gaps on the reference genome,
presence of structural variation (SV) breakpoints, and any CNV in the matching germline
sample. CNV were also detected using SNP 6.0 arrays that were used as an additional
quality control step for WGS (Fig. S4).

Author Manuscript

Chromothripsis—Korbel and Campbell (Supplementary Information) recently proposed
four criteria that define chromothripsis: (1) clustering of breakpoints; (2) randomness of
DNA fragment joins; (3) randomness of DNA fragment order; and (4) ability to walk the
derivative chromosome. Since randomness of DNA fragment order (Criteria 3) was not
entirely valid based on Korbel and Campbell’s own analysis, we decided not to evaluate this
feature. For all structural variations (SVs) with at least 1 breakpoint on chromosome 11, we
performed Bartlett’s goodness-of-fit test for exponential distribution to assess whether the
distribution of SV breakpoints in each tumor departs from the null hypothesis of random

distribution. A significant departure from random distribution supports clustering of SV
breakpoints. To evaluate whether there is any bias in the DNA fragment joints categorized
by the SV types (i.e. deletion, tandem duplication, head-to-head re-arrangements and tail-totail re-arrangements), we applied goodness-of-fit tests separately for inter- and intrachromosomal events with a minimum of 5 SVs. A significant p value suggests biased
fragment joins, which would not support chromothripsis. When both inter- and intrachromosomal data are available, we reported the lower p value to represent a more
conservative assessment of the random distribution for DNA fragment joints.

Author Manuscript

RNA sequencing—Paired-end sequencing was performed using the Illumina Genome
Analyzer IIx or HighSeq platform with 100-bp read length. The resulting paired-end reads
were aligned to four databases using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA 0.5.5): (i) human
NCBI Build 37 reference sequence, (ii) RefSeq, (iii) a sequence file that represents all
possible combinations of non-sequential pairs in RefSeq exons, and (iv) AceView flat file
(UCSC), representing transcripts constructed from human expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
After this initial mapping, final BAM files were produced by selecting the best alignment in
the four databases. Structural variation detection was carried out using CREST.
Additionally, to identify fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq we created an application called
“CICERO” (Cicero Is Crest Extended for RNA Optimizations), a local assembly-based
method that utilizes unmapped and soft-clipped reads. CICERO assembles reads around
breakpoints and maps the contig to the genome to find structural variations at the
transcription level. CICERO is able to find fusions with low expression, fusions within
repetitive regions, fusions with a short first exon, and complex fusions involving more than
two genes.

Author Manuscript

Validation of genetic alterations—A custom capture array was designed to enrich for
the 18,826 high quality SNVs (tiers1-3) and indels and 947 SVs discovered by WGS. This
array was used to validate the presence of the non-reference allele in tumour DNA and its
absence from the matched normal sample. After enrichment, samples were sequenced using
Illumina technology, and resulting reads were mapped to the reference genome.
For sequences that remained uncovered we performed independent polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification followed by sequencing on the MiSeq platform (Illumina).
Reads were mapped as before, and 10889 alterations were validated as somatic mutations.
RNAseq was also used to confirm the presence of aberrant SV transcripts detected by DNA
sequencing. Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR was also used to validate the presence of
fusion transcripts (see below).

Author Manuscript

Calculation of background mutation rate—The background mutation rate was
calculated using validated and high quality tier 3 mutations (i.e. mutations in non-coding,
non-regulatory and non-repetitive regions) normalized against all tier3 regions with effective
coverage (i.e. covered by >10x in both tumour and matching normal samples).
Calculation of significance of SV position—The genome was divided into bins of 10
Mb. Breakpoint frequencies in each bin were calculated for individual samples. The

enrichment of SV breakpoint frequency in cerebral samples was measured by the MannWhitney test and raw p values were adjusted using the Holm method implemented in the
p.adjust function in R (version 2.11.1).
Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH)
FISH probes were derived from BAC clones (BACPAC Resources, Oakland, CA), labeled
with either AlexaFluor-488 or Rhodamine fluorochromes, and validated on normal control
metaphase spreads (Table S15).
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry was performed on both human and mouse tumours using sections
(5μm) of FFPE tissue. For detection of p-RELA, sections were treated to heat-induced
antigen retrieval for 40 minutes, followed by overnight incubation with p-NF-κB p65
antibody (Ser276, bs-3543R, Bioss, Woburn, MA, 1:500 dilution). Signal detection used the
Ultravision Plus detection system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Immunohistochemistry for L1CAM was carried out using the Leica BOND-III platform
(Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The protocol consisted of heat-induced antigenretrieval for 20 min followed by a 15 minute incubation with anti-LICAM antibody (L4543,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 1:100 dilution). Signal detection used the Novocastra Bond
Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).
Immunohistochemistry for CCND1 was undertaken on the BenchMark ULTRA system
(Ventana, Tucson AZ). Following heat-induced antigen-retrieval for 36 min, tissues were
incubated for 32 min with anti-CCND1 antibody (241R-18, Cell Marque, Rocklin CA,
prediluted). The ultraView Universal DAB detection kit (Ventana, Tucson AZ) was used for
signal detection.

Western Blot Analysis
Western Blot analysis was performed using standard techniques. Antibodies employed
included NF-κB p65 (ab32536; Rb monoclonal and Cell Signaling #4282), GAPDH
(Millipore #374), Lamin B1 (Abcam #ab16048), and β-Actin (CST 4967; Rb polyclonal).
RT-PCR

Transcription of fusion produces from SVs was confirmed by RT-PCR. RNA was extracted
from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour samples, and reverse-transcribed using
SuperScript® VILO™ (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and iScript cDNA Synthesis
System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) respectively. PCR was carried out using GoTaq® Long
PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI), using specific primers (Supplementary Table
S14). Fusions were confirmed by direct sequencing.
Cloning and Retroviral Production
Human cDNA clones of C11ORF95, RELA and YAP1 were cloned into the pCX4-IRESRed Fluorescence (cRFP) vector. The Clontech In-Fusion HD EcoDry Cloning Plus system
was used to generate fusion constructs. All constructs were verified by sequencing and used
to make retroviruses as described7. Retrovirus-containing medium was collected,

centrifuged, filtered and concentrated using Centricon plus 70-Millipore. The viral titer was
determined by flow cytometric analysis of neural stem cells transduced with different
dilutions of cDNA encoding retroviruses.

Promoter transactivation Reporter assays

Mycoplasma negative, human 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268™) were lysed directly on
plate using 500uL Buffer A (10mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10mM KCl; 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM
EDTA, 4% IGEPAL and 10ug/mL of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) for 10min at
room temperature. After high speed centrifugation, lysates corresponding to the cytoplasmic
fraction were transferred to a new tube. The pellet was resuspended by vigorous shaking at
4°C in 150uL buffer B (20mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4M NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol
and 10ug/mL of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Following top speed centrifugation,
lysates corresponding to the nuclear fraction were transferred to a new tube. Total protein
concentration was assessed by Bradford analysis and samples were prepared for western blot
using equal volumes of 2x RIPA Buffer.

Cells were co-transfected with 6μg of NF-κB reporter plasmid 5xkB.eGFP. Forty-eight
hours later cells were stimulated, or not, for 6–8 hours with 5–50ng/mL human TNF.
Reporter fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry using a LSR II device (BD
Biosciences).
Mouse RNA Samples

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized
using the SuperScript® VILO™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using iQ SYBR
Green Supermix on iCycler Real-Time Detection System (BioRad). The primer set used for
C11ORF95 was 5′ GCGCTACTACCACGACCACT 3′ and 5′
CTCCAATGCAAGGAGTAGGG 3′.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)

Author Manuscript

To investigate the effect of the C11orf95-RELA fusion products on cell transcriptomes, we
used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa)
to compare gene expression profiles among cells and tumours harboring various C11orf95RELA fusions. In each analysis, only genes demonstrating a ≥4-fold expression difference
between datasets were included for network and transcription regulator analysis. Differential
expression profiles were generated for the following 4 datasets using HT MG-430 PM
Affymetrix array:
1.

Mouse embryonic E14.5 NSC derived RELAFUS1 tumours vs parental mouse
embryonic E14.5 NSCs (1,470 genes; 2,016 probe sets).

2.

Mouse embryonic E14.5 NSCs transduced with RELAFUS1 vs control-transduced
NSC (946 genes; 1320 probe sets).

3.

Mouse embryonic E14.5 NSCs transduced with RELAWT vs control-transduced
NSCs (134 genes; 178 probe sets).

4.

Mouse embryonic E14.5 NSCs transduced with C11orf95 vs control-transduced
NSCs (15 genes; 18 probe sets).

Author Manuscript

Ingenuity networks were constructed by comparing differentially expressed genes from each
dataset to the curated Ingenuity database, which includes physical interactions and
associations between genes and microRNAs derived from multiple public databases and the
literature. Networks of fixed size that maximize connectivity to our gene list were
constructed and ranked by inclusivity of differentially expressed genes and the number of
multiply connected or ‘focus genes’ in the Ingenuity database. Statistical significance of
networks was determined by Fishers exact test. Log ratio data were introduced into network
visualization, but were not part of the statistical model. The top 10 significant networks in
each dataset are presented in Table S17.
Affymetrix microarray analysis

Author Manuscript

mRNA expression profiles were generated using total RNA isolated from human and mouse
tissues and the U133 Plus 2.0 and 430 v 2 microarrays, respectively (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Gene expression data were normalized using the MAS 5.0 algorithm. The data
were then transformed and variance stabilized by addition of small factor of 20 that shrinks
the effects of small numbers and then taking the natural logarithm. The median absolute
difference (MAD) of these transformed signals was calculated for each probe set across all
samples on each array separately within species. The data was then imported into Spotfire
Decision Site (Palo Alto CA, USA) and for each probe set and subject z-scores were
calculated by computing the mean and standard deviation across subjects within each
probeset. Differences in gene expression between defined groups (e.g., control transduced
vs. RELAFUS1 transduced NSCs) were defined using a series of Welch t-tests as described
(main manuscript Ref. 7). The resultant lists of p-values were used to define probesets that
passed the Bonferroni threshold at 0.05 percent. Targets of NF-κB signaling were identified
from a compilation of Rel/NF-κB target genes that is derived from the survey paper
Activators and target genes of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors (Pahl, Oncogene 1999),
the Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors website of TD Gilmore, and additional search with
PubMed available at http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/.
Additional statistical considerations

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that mock transduced NSCs do not form tumours in mice, and
that a cohort size of 15 mice is adequately powered to detect a tumor incidence of 10% in
mice implanted with oncogene transduced NSCs6. Therefore, 15 mice each were
transplanted with NSCs harboring the indicated fusion construct, or single partner gene.
Since no intervention was applied to animals following cell implantation, no randomization
of animals or blinding of investigators was performed.
