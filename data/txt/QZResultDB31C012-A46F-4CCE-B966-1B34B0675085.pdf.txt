Abstract
The low-fidelity polymerase H (polH) is required for bypass of
UV-induced pyrimidine dimers inserting adenine nucleotides
opposite these lesions. Mutations in the polh gene are
responsible for the genetic defect in xeroderma pigmentosum
variant patients. To study if the lack of polH significantly
elevates spontaneous mutation frequency in various organs
and tissues of the mouse, we crossed polH-deficient mice with
transgenic mice harboring a chromosomally integrated
lacZ-plasmid reporter construct. In cultured embryonic
fibroblasts from the lacZ-polH / mice, 2.5 J/m2 UV irradiation induced f5-fold more mutations than in cells from
lacZ control mice, in which an f3-fold increase in mutation
frequency was found compared with the normal level.
Whereas untreated cells harbored mainly 1-bp deletions, UV
induced both transitions and transversions, with the latter
type more highly represented in the polH-null cells than in
the controls. No difference in mutation induction between the
polH-null cells and the wild-type cells was observed after
treatment with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. Having shown the
validity of the lacZ model to accurately identify polHassociated mutagenesis, we then determined the mutant
frequency at the lacZ locus in liver, spleen, and small intestine
of 12-month-old animals. No differences were found between
polH-null, heterozygous, or littermate control mice. We
conclude that the polH defect is specific for UV damage and
has no effect on in vivo mutagenesis in mice. [Cancer Res

Introduction
DNA polymerase D (polD) is a Y polymerase capable of
replicating past cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), the major
lesion induced in DNA by UV radiation. The importance of polD
in reducing mutagenesis in human skin, preventing skin cancer
from sun exposure, is illustrated by the xeroderma pigmentosum
variant syndrome. Patients afflicted with this disease lack polD
expression and are more than 1,000 times more susceptible to skin
cancer than normal individuals (1).
PolD knockout mice have been generated and are viable and
fertile and do not show any obvious spontaneous defects during
the first year of life (2). To test if polD-defective mice accumulate
spontaneous mutations at a more rapid pace than normal mice, we

crossed these animals with transgenic mice harboring a lacZ
reporter gene. Being part of a plasmid construct, this reporter can
be recovered from its integrated state and amplified in Escherichia
coli to determine mutant frequencies and spectra. We show that
although UV irradiation of lacZ-polD / embryonic fibroblasts
readily induced a great excess of mutations over the UV-irradiated
control cells, no effect was observed in vivo in several organs of the
polD-null mice up until 24 months.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic animals. polD+/ mice in a C57BL/6J background were
crossed with C57BL/6J pUR288-(lacZ)-transgenic mice, line 30 (integration
site on chromosome 11; ref. 3) and bred among each other to generate
polD / animals hemizygous for pUR288 (lacZ). The polD+/ and polD+/+
lacZ littermate animals served as controls. The animals were maintained
in the animal facilities of the Buck Institute for Age Research. The mice
were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at a standard
temperature of 23jC. Standard lab chow (Harlan Teklad) and water were
supplied ad libitum. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation followed
by cervical dislocation at 2, 12, and 24 mo of age. Tissues were removed
from the animal, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC until
required.
Cell isolation and culture. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)
were isolated from day 13.5 embryos generated from the aforementioned
F1 crosses between the polD+/ and lacZ+/ animals. MEF isolation has
been described previously (4). Experiments were conducted on cells at
passage 3.
Treatment of MEFs with UV radiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea.
lacZ MEFs prepared from individual embryos of polD / , polD+/ , or polD+/+
genotypes were plated in 10-cm dishes (106 cells) in the presence of 10%
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated for 24 h. For UV
irradiation, proliferating cells were washed twice with PBS, covered with a
thin layer of PBS, and irradiated in lidless culture dishes using a germicidal
lamp (254 nm, 15 W; General Electric). The PBS was removed and fresh
medium was provided to the cells before returning them to culture. For
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS
and then incubated with 3 mmol/L ENU (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) in medium
without serum for 2 h at 37jC. After the treatment period, the cells were
washed twice with PBS and fresh medium was provided. The cells were
returned to culture. Control cells were mock treated. Cells were harvested
72 h after treatment.
Plasmid rescue and mutation analysis. DNA was isolated by routine
phenol/chloroform extractions. Complete protocols for plasmid rescue,
mutant frequency determinations, and mutant analysis with this model
have been described elsewhere (3–5). To characterize the mutations, the
complete lacZ gene of 10 mutants per condition was sequenced. Sequence
reactions of purified plasmids were outsourced to Davis Sequencing. The
returned chromatograms were analyzed with Sequencher (Gene Codes). The
primers used for the sequencing reactions were the same as previously
described (4).
Statistical analysis. Unpaired t test was used for all statistical analyses
using the statistical program GraphPad InStat (GraphPad Software).
P < 0.05 was considered significant.

with the polD deficiency can be accurately detected in the lacZ
reporter system, we prepared MEFs from the embryos of polD wildtype, heterozygous, and knockout mice and subjected these cells to
either 2.5 J/m2 UVC radiation or 3 mmol/L ENU. lacZ mutant
frequencies were measured 72 h after exposure. In keeping with our
previous results (6), we found that the overall mutant frequencies
in cells derived from wild-type animals were increased by 3.2- and
3.7-fold following exposure to UV or ENU treatment, respectively
(Fig. 1). The cells derived from polD heterozygous mice behaved
similarly to those from the wild-type mice. In the knockout mice,
however, whereas the ENU-treated cells behaved no differently
from those of wild-type and heterozygous mice, the UV-irradiated
cells showed a dramatic 11-fold increase in mutant frequency when
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1).

Mutation Frequencies in polh-Deficient Mice

To further characterize the types of mutations induced by UV or
ENU in polD-proficient and polD-deficient cells, we characterized
the lacZ mutants recovered from the cells. lacZ-plasmids showing
no change in size after restriction digestion (no-change mutants)
are generally point mutations, whereas those plasmids that show a
size change after digestion (size-change mutants) are generally
genome rearrangements with one break point within the lacZ and
another elsewhere in the mouse genome (7). As expected, most of
the UV- or ENU-induced mutations in all of the genotypes studied
were of the no-change class (Fig. 1).
To further investigate the nature of the point mutations
induced in polD wild-type and knockout MEFs after exposure to
UV or ENU, we sequenced 10 lacZ mutants of the no-change class
for each experimental group. In the cells deficient for polD, the
spontaneous mutation spectrum consisted mostly of 1-bp
deletions, similar to the control cells (Fig. 2; Table 1). UV, in
both mutant and control cells, was found to induce base pair
substitutions. The polD-deficient cells were different from the
controls by a relatively higher fraction of transversion mutations
(Table 1). This shift to more transversion mutations in polDdeficient cells has also been reported by others (8). Interestingly,
following UV treatment in both wild-type and polD-deficient cells,
we did not observe any persisting 1-bp deletions. The ENU
spectrum was not significantly different between the mutant and
wild-type cells.
Mutant frequencies in tissues of polH-deficient mice.
Figure 3 shows the total spontaneous mutant frequencies in
liver, spleen, and small intestine of polD wild-type, heterozygous,
and knockout mice. The average mutant frequency in the liver of
12-month-old wild-type mice was 8.4  10 5, with no significant
difference when livers of heterozygous (9.2  10 5) or knockout
(8.1  10 5) animals were studied (Fig. 3A). Similarly, no
significant difference in mutant frequency was observed in the
spleens of 12-month-old polD wild-type (7.2  10 5), heterozygous
(7.0  10 5), or knockout (7.6  10 5) mice (Fig. 3B). We did
observe a higher mutant frequency in the small intestine of
similarly aged polD knockout mice (25.5  10 5) when compared
with wild-type (16.6  10 5) or heterozygous (15.5  10 5)
controls. However, it is obvious that the SD in this case was very
high (Fig. 3C), which is due to a very high mutant frequency in one
animal. Such occasional outliers are not unusual in this kind of
experiment, but we nevertheless decided to follow this up by
determining the mutant frequency in the small intestine of
24-month-old polD mice. Figure 3D shows that even at 2 years of

age there was no effect of the polD deficiency on the spontaneous
mutant frequency in the small intestine. Although an extensive life
span study was not performed on these animals, we did notice
that there seems to be no phenotypic effect of the polD deficiency.
Of the seven animals remaining after our 12-month determination
point, none died prematurely and the two not sacrificed at
24 months were still alive at 28 months.

Discussion
The Y polymerase polD, encoded by the POLH gene, is able to
insert the correct A base across a cyclobutane thymidine dimer, the
main UV-induced lesion. When encountering replication-blocking
lesions, the use of such enzymes increases the chance of survival
while maintaining genome integrity. The results presented in this
article indicate that the loss of this enzyme in mouse cells is
associated with a dramatic increase in UV-induced mutations. This
result is very similar to what has been observed in human POLH
fibroblasts, lacking this same polymerase, using the hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) selectable locus assay (9). Like
in the HPRT assay, we also observed a shift to primarily
transversion mutations. Interestingly, after treatment with the
powerful mutagen ENU, we did not see any difference in mutation
induction between polD-defective cells and their wild-type controls.
Hence, these results validate the lacZ system in accurately
measuring mutations associated with polD deficiency.
There is some evidence that, at least in vitro, polD can bypass
several other DNA lesions that seem to be structurally unrelated.
For example, it has been shown that yeast and human polD
replicate DNA containing 8-oxoguanine efficiently and accurately
by inserting a cytosine across the lesion and by proficiently
extending from this base pair (10). In that study, spontaneous
mutations were found to increase in the absence of polD in yeast,
suggesting a possibly more general role for polD in the suppression
of spontaneous mutations that can give rise to human internal
cancers. The results of our present work, which was undertaken to
investigate the possible mutagenic effect of polD deficiency in vivo,
do not support this. Indeed, the spontaneous mutant frequencies
at the lacZ locus in the polD-deficient mice do not exceed
those normally observed in these tissues. Even as late as 24 months
in highly mitotically active tissue from the small intestine, no
evidence was obtained for an increased level of spontaneous
mutations. This is in spite of the fact that we have previously
reported a considerable age-related increase of point mutations in
this tissue that most likely results from replication errors (11).
Meanwhile, our present data do not directly refute the
possibility that oxidative damage, such as 8-oxoguanine, is
bypassed by polD. However, if such bypass would occur and the
presence of 8-oxoguanine would give rise to increased mutant
frequencies in vitro, we should have observed higher spontaneous

mutant frequencies in the polD-defective cells due to oxygen
present during cell culture. As shown in Fig. 1, this was not the
case. Although we routinely culture cells at 3% and not at 20%
oxygen, some oxidative damage is unavoidable (e.g., during
isolation of the cells, which is at ambient oxygen). Indeed,
previous results from our laboratory revealed 8-oxoguanine
signature mutations in MEFs, which were significantly elevated
at 20% oxygen (4).
Thus, our data support the concept that polD is a highly specific
enzyme that evolved during evolution solely for translesion
synthesis across CPDs. This begs the question as to why polD
seems to be equally proficient in mouse cells as in human cells in its
role of suppressing CPD-associated mutations. Indeed, whereas in
humans polD is obviously of great importance, its utility in mice is
unclear. Mice are night animals with a fur and are therefore unlikely
to ever encounter significant amounts of UV. Indeed, mice and rats
almost completely lack global nucleotide excision repair (12, 13),
the pathway that is critically important to repair CPDs before these
can give rise to mutations. It is therefore somewhat surprising that
they have maintained proficient polD-mediated CPD translesion
synthesis. Of note, all Y polymerases are present in vertebrates. It
is therefore conceivable that translesion synthesis is a highly costeffective way to prevent mutations and that mice simply have not
lost this enzyme, possibly because they occasionally still have some
exposure to sunlight through their ears and eyes.
Finally, although in this present study we focused on the
possibility that polD deficiency could affect spontaneous mutagenesis in vivo, lacZ-polD / hybrid mice have other applications too.
For example, they could be used in pursuing interesting questions
related to the role of polD in generating different types of mutations
during somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes in B
cells (14).
