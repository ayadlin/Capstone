the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated, which is associated
with the activation of the proapoptotic Bax that mediates the
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria leading to the
subsequent activation of the caspase cascade resulting in cell
death (3, 4).
Another large group of chemotherapeutic drugs successfully used
in the clinic are the spindle-damaging agents. Various Vinca
alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, etc.) depolymerize microtubules and prevent the attachment of kinetochores to spindle
microtubules resulting in an inhibition of chromosome alignment
during mitosis. In contrast, taxanes and epothilones stabilize
microtubules and suppress the dynamics of the mitotic spindle
resulting also in an inhibition of chromosome alignment. Stabilization of the mitotic spindle still allows the (partial) attachment of
chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, but tension across sister
kinetochores cannot be generated. A lack of either attachment or
tension activates a mitotic signaling pathway known as the mitotic
spindle checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all
chromosomes are properly aligned. Thus, treatment with spindledamaging drugs leads to the activation of the spindle checkpoint
and to an arrest during mitosis. Mad1, Mad2, Bub1, BubR1, and
Mps1 are essential spindle checkpoint components that are
recruited to kinetochores on checkpoint activation (5). In addition,
the ‘‘chromosomal passenger’’ proteins survivin and Aurora B are
required for spindle checkpoint function in response to the lack of
tension (6–9). Thus, two functional arms of the spindle checkpoint
can be defined. However, the molecular mechanisms of spindle
checkpoint activation are not well understood. During chemotherapy, the spindle checkpoint–mediated mitotic arrest is followed by
an unscheduled exit from mitosis due to checkpoint adaptation.
Interestingly, checkpoint activation as well as slippage from mitosis
seem to be required for efficient induction of apoptosis (10–12).
Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, it is
intriguing that survivin can function as a positive regulator of the
checkpoint as well as an antiapoptotic protein, possibly mediating
a crosstalk between the spindle checkpoint and apoptosis (13).
Checkpoint defects are frequent in human cancer and can confer
resistance toward chemotherapy (12, 14). Among the most frequent
lesions in human cancer is the functional loss of p53, which can
directly contribute to resistance toward DNA-damaging drugs.
However, because p53-deficient cancer cells arrest solely before
mitosis on DNA damage, those cells can be selectively targeted for
cell death by inactivating the remaining G2 checkpoint (15).
Abrogation of the G2 checkpoint arrest can be mediated by the
kinase inhibitor 7-hydroxystaurosporine, also known as UCN-01,
which inhibits the Chk1 kinase, an essential component of the G2
checkpoint (16–18). Thus, a sequential treatment with DNAdamaging agents and UCN-01 forces cells to enter mitosis in the
presence of DNA damage resulting in a potentiation of cell death
compared with treatment with DNA-damaging agents alone
(19, 20). Although UCN-01 is not entirely specific for Chk1, its
potential to abrogate the G2 checkpoint has been well characterized

Abstract
The novel concept of anticancer treatment termed ‘‘G2
checkpoint abrogation’’ aims to target p53-deficient tumor
cells and is currently explored in clinical trials. The anticancer
drug UCN-01 is used to abrogate a DNA damage–induced G2
cell cycle arrest leading to mitotic entry and subsequent
cell death, which is poorly defined as ‘‘mitotic cell death’’ or
‘‘mitotic catastrophe.’’ We show here that UCN-01 treatment
results in a mitotic arrest that requires an active mitotic
spindle checkpoint, involving the function of Mad2, Bub1,
BubR1, Mps1, Aurora B, and survivin. During the mitotic
arrest, hallmark parameters of the mitochondria-associated
apoptosis pathway become activated. Interestingly, this
apoptotic response requires the spindle checkpoint protein
Mad2, suggesting a proapoptotic function for Mad2. However,
although survivin and Aurora B are also required for the
mitotic arrest, both proteins are part of an antiapoptotic
pathway that restrains the UCN-01–induced apoptosis by
promoting hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 and by inhibiting
the activation of Bax. Consequently, inhibition of the antiapoptotic pathway by genetic ablation of survivin or by pharmacologic inhibitors of Aurora B or cyclin-dependent kinase 1
lead to a significant enhancement of apoptosis and therefore
act synergistically with UCN-01. Thus, by defining the
mechanism of cell death on G2 checkpoint abrogation we
show a highly improved strategy for an anticancer treatment
by the combined use of UCN-01 with abrogators of the
survivin/Aurora B–dependent antiapoptotic pathway that
retains the selectivity for p53-defective cancer cells. [Cancer

Introduction
The introduction of genotoxic damage is a general scheme of
anticancer chemotherapy, which activates cell cycle checkpoint
signaling pathways arresting the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis
when repair cannot be accomplished (1, 2). For instance, DNAdamaging drugs (e.g., topoisomerase inhibitors, cisplatin, etc.)
activate the DNA damage checkpoint involving the function of
the tumor suppressor p53, which contributes to a cell cycle arrest
in G1 and G2. In addition, a p53-independent branch of the DNA
damage checkpoint is activated that involves the Chk1 kinase and
arrests cells solely before mitosis (1). On prolonged cell cycle arrest,

(16–18, 20, 21). However, the mechanisms of cell death induced by
sequential treatment with DNA-damaging drugs and UCN-01 are
not well understood. In fact, ‘‘mitotic cell death,’’ also often referred
to as ‘‘mitotic catastrophe’’ is ill defined and apoptotic and
nonapoptotic mechanisms have been discussed to be involved in
this particular form of cell death (3, 22). Nevertheless, preclinical
results using UCN-01 are promising and, thus, several phase I
clinical trials in various cancer entities that combine various DNAdamaging drugs with UCN-01 are under way (23, 24).
Here, we investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by G2
checkpoint abrogation. We show that a sequential treatment with
Adriamycin and UCN-01 induces a mitotic arrest, which is
dependent on the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Subsequently,
apoptotic variables are activated in mitotically arrested cells and
promoted by a proapoptotic function of the spindle checkpoint
component Mad2 but counteracted by a survivin/Aurora B–
dependent antiapoptotic pathway. Importantly, pharmacologic
abrogation of the mitotic survival pathway using cyclin-dependent
kinase 1 (CDK1) or Aurora B kinase inhibitors greatly improves
UCN-01–mediated therapy, suggesting a novel strategy for an
anticancer treatment.

G2 checkpoint abrogation activates a mitotic checkpoint
that involves spindle checkpoint and chromosomal passenger
proteins. Similar to studies with several p53-deficient human cell
lines (17, 20), treatment of p53 compromised HeLa cells with the
topoisomerase II inhibitor Adriamycin induced DNA double-strand
breaks and arrested cells in G2 (data not shown). Subsequent
treatment with UCN-01 induced a transition from G2 arrest into
mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Microscopic inspection of
mitotic cells revealed a metaphase-like phenotype with up to 70%
of cells arrested in mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The UCN-01–
induced mitotic arrest was clearly associated with the activation of
the mitotic spindle checkpoint as shown by the specific
recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1 to kinetochores (Fig. 1A). To test
whether the individual components of the spindle checkpoint are
required for the UCN-01–induced mitotic arrest, we expressed
shRNAs to down-regulate the spindle checkpoint proteins Bub1,
BubR1, Mad2, and Mps1 to similar levels (Fig. 1B). As shown in
Fig. 1C, down-regulation of the spindle checkpoint proteins led to
an escape from the mitotic arrest after treatment with nocodazole
(that depolymerizes microtubules and induces a lack of kinetochore attachment) or Taxol (that stabilizes microtubules and
induces a lack of kinetochore tension), whereas control shRNAs
showed no effect (Fig. 1B and C). Because the mitotic arrest directly
correlates with the spindle checkpoint activation, these results
indicate a similar functional impairment of the checkpoint on
repression of the individual checkpoint components either after a
lack of attachment or on the lack of tension. Importantly, downregulation of the spindle checkpoint proteins also led to an efficient
escape from the mitotic arrest after Adriamycin and UCN-01
treatment (Fig. 1D), indicating that a fully functional spindle
checkpoint is required for the UCN-01–induced mitotic arrest.
In addition to the spindle checkpoint proteins, survivin and
Aurora B are involved in the spindle checkpoint activation
specifically on treatment with Taxol. In agreement with these
studies (6–8), both shRNA-mediated repression of survivin (Fig. 1B)
and inhibition of the Aurora B kinase activity by the specific
inhibitor ZM447439 abolished the mitotic arrest on Taxol but not
after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2A), indicating that both proteins
are required for a sustained mitotic arrest in response to a lack of
kinetochore tension. Consequently, we investigated if survivin and
Aurora B are involved in the UCN-01–mediated mitotic arrest and
found a specific requirement for both proteins (Fig. 2B).
Thus, on abrogation of the G2 checkpoint by UCN-01, p53deficient tumor cells enter mitosis in the presence of DNA damage
and activate a mitotic checkpoint that requires the spindle
checkpoint proteins as well as the chromosomal passenger
proteins leading to a sustained mitotic arrest.
UCN-01–treated mitotic cells undergo apoptosis. Sequential
treatment of DNA-damaging drugs and UCN-01 potentiates cell
death by inducing mitotic cell death or mitotic catastrophe
(Supplementary Fig. S2, refs. 16, 19, 20, 30). We asked whether this
form of cell death represents a mitotic form of apoptosis or
whether it is rather unrelated to apoptosis as suggested before (3).
After Adriamycin and UCN-01 treatment, we separated mitotic
from nonmitotic cells and determined the activation of biochemical parameters specific to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis,
which include the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into
the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A); the enzymatic activation of caspase-2,
caspase-3, and caspase-9 (Fig. 3B); the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 3C);
and the internucleosomal fragmentation of chromosomal DNA

Mechanisms of UCN-01–Induced Mitotic Cell Death

Mad2 is part of a proapoptotic pathway on UCN-01
treatment. To evaluate the role of the spindle checkpoint for the
induction of mitotic apoptosis, we down-regulated Mad2, Bub1,
and BubR1 as shown before (Fig. 1), treated the cells sequentially
with Adriamycin and UCN-01, quantified the induction of
apoptotic figures (Fig. 4A), and detected the cleavage of PARP
(Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, although equally required for the mitotic
arrest (Fig. 1), down-regulation of Mad2, but not of Bub1 or BubR1,
resulted in an efficient escape from mitotic apoptosis. In fact,
caspase-3 activity was reduced by f60% after Mad2 repression and
UCN-01 treatment (Fig. 4C). These results suggest a proapoptotic
function for Mad2 that might be independent of the checkpointmediated mitotic arrest, although we cannot exclude an involvement of additional spindle checkpoint proteins.
Survivin is part of an antiapoptotic pathway on UCN-01
treatment. Because survivin acts as a spindle checkpoint component that is required for the UCN-01–induced mitotic arrest
(Fig. 2B), we asked whether it also participates in the regulation of
mitotic apoptosis. First, we followed the protein level of survivin
during the treatment. Survivin accumulated in G2-arrested cells
treated with Adriamycin, which is consistent with the notion of
a cell cycle–regulated expression of survivin (31). Moreover, on UCN01 treatment when cells traverse from the G2 arrest into mitosis, we
found a dramatic increase of survivin protein (Fig. 5A). Interestingly,
the mitotic accumulation of survivin was associated with a
hyperphosphorylation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 5A),
which has been shown recently to be associated with stabilization
and enhancement of the antiapoptotic activity of Bcl-2 (32–34).
shRNA-mediated repression of survivin led to a loss of the UCN-01–
induced hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2, suggesting a functional
interaction between survivin and a Bcl-2–mediated antiapoptotic
activity (Fig. 5A). To test this directly, we assayed caspase-3 activity

(Fig. 3D). Clearly, the activation of all specific apoptotic variables
was restricted to mitotic cells reflected by a high mitotic index
(74 F 5%; Fig. 3A). Cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole (mitotic
index, 84 F 6%) did not show any activation of the apoptotic
variables (Fig. 3A), excluding the possibility that mitotically
arrested cells show an activation of these apoptotic variables per
se. These results show that the forced entry into mitosis by UCN-01
is a prerequisite for the activation of the mitochondria-associated
apoptosis machinery.

survival pathway led to the idea that pharmacologic inhibition of
the antiapoptotic pathway could be used in a clinical setting to
enhance the efficacy of UCN-01–mediated therapy. Previous reports
have indicated that survivin stability and function might be
positively regulated by phosphorylation through CDK1 (13, 35, 36).
Further, survivin is part of the chromosomal passenger complex
and interacts directly with the Aurora B kinase, which might also
contribute to its stability and function (13, 37–40). Therefore, we
used potent inhibitors for CDK1 (roscovitine and purvalanol A)
and the Aurora kinases (ZM447439) to investigate whether
interference with these kinases would act synergistically with
UCN-01. Interestingly, CDKs and Aurora kinases are validated
targets for anticancer treatment and inhibitors are currently
explored in clinical trials (23, 37). Indeed, cotreatment with
roscovitine, purvalanol A, or ZM447439 decreased the protein
level of survivin and led to the loss of Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation
similar to that seen before on survivin repression (Fig. 6A).
Accordingly, the UCN-01–induced caspase activity was greatly
enhanced on cotreatment with the inhibitors and, as seen on
repression of survivin, this increase was reversed by expression of
Bcl-2, whereas treatment with the kinase inhibitors alone had only
a minor effect (Fig. 6B).
Together, our results clearly suggest that pharmacologic
inhibitors of CDK1 and Aurora kinases abrogate the survivindependent antiapoptotic pathway and thus greatly improve the
outcome of UCN-01–mediated therapy (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The Chk1 kinase is essential for the DNA damage–induced G2
checkpoint and restrains entry into mitosis (18, 21). The development of the Chk1 kinase inhibitor UCN-01, although not entirely

on survivin depletion in response to UCN-01 treatment and found
that the caspase activity was dramatically increased (Fig. 5B).
Intriguingly, whereas apoptosis in response to UCN-01 was not
influenced by expression of Bcl-2, the increase in caspase activity on
survivin repression was completely suppressed by the expression of
Bcl-2 (Fig. 5B). Because Bcl-2 is a potent antagonist for the
proapoptotic Bax protein, our findings raise the interesting
possibility that UCN-01–induced apoptosis might occur independent of the activation of Bax, which might be suppressed by survivin.
Therefore, we investigated the activation status of Bax by using
conformation-specific immunoprecipitation assays (27, 28). Indeed,
we found that Bax became activated during the G2 arrest in response
to Adriamycin treatment when the survivin level is low but
inactivated on UCN-01 treatment when the survivin level is high
(Fig. 5C). Importantly, on survivin repression, Bax was found to be
reactivated, suggesting that Bax activation might indeed be
controlled by survivin. In contrast, down-regulation of Mad2, which
was associated with a high survivin level and a low mitotic index
(Fig. 5C), did not induce a reactivation of Bax, arguing against the
possibility that Bax is solely activated due to the unscheduled exit
from mitosis. Unlike Bax, we found no evidence for an activation of
its homologue Bak, neither after Adriamycin nor after subsequent
UCN-01 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Together, these results suggest that survivin might be part of
a UCN-01–induced antiapoptotic pathway, which is associated
with the hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 and a mitotic inactivation
of Bax (Fig. 6C).
Pharmacologic interference with the survivin-dependent
mitotic survival pathway potentiates UCN-01–induced apoptosis. Our results after genetic abrogation of the survivin-dependent

Mechanisms of UCN-01–Induced Mitotic Cell Death

survivin or pharmacologic abrogation of the prosurvival pathway
by compounds targeting either CDK1 or Aurora B kinase results in
a significant enhancement of apoptosis in response to UCN-01
treatment.
Based on these results, we suggest a novel and highly improved
strategy of chemotherapy combining DNA-damaging drugs,
UCN-01, and inhibitors of CDK1 or Aurora B kinase to significantly
enhance the efficacy of G2 checkpoint abrogation without neglecting the selectivity for p53-deficient tumor cells.
At first glance, it seems odd that some checkpoint proteins
(e.g., Mad2) promote apoptosis, whereas others (e.g., survivin and
Aurora B) inhibit cell death, but our data suggest that these

specific, has allowed to establish the therapeutic concept of G2
checkpoint abrogation that potentiates tumor cell killing selectively in p53-deficient tumor cells (16, 17, 19, 20, 24). Consequently,
several phase I clinical trials currently explore this concept by
combining various DNA-damaging drugs with UCN-01 (e.g.; ref. 24).
However, the mechanisms and requirements of cell death on G2
checkpoint abrogation remained largely unknown. We have
addressed these questions and established the following points:
(a) UCN-01–mediated G2 checkpoint abrogation induces entry into
mitosis, which is associated with a metaphase-like arrest that
requires the mitotic spindle checkpoint. (b) The spindle checkpoint
protein Mad2 is required for the induction of apoptosis in response
to UCN-01 treatment. (c) The chromosomal passenger protein
survivin, which is required for the mitotic arrest, is part of a
prosurvival pathway induced by UCN-01. (d) Genetic ablation of

complex’’ and can possibly act as a regulatory subunit of the
Aurora kinase (43). It is therefore possible that survivin mediates its
antiapoptotic function during mitosis through regulation of the
Aurora B kinase. Our results have shown a very similar enhancement of apoptosis either after ablation of survivin or on inhibition
of Aurora B kinase activity. In future studies, it will be important to
dissect the individual functions of survivin and Aurora B with
respect to their antiapoptotic role during mitosis.
Most importantly, our results imply that Mad2 and survivin/
Aurora B are central effectors of chemotherapies that target mitosis. Indeed, down-regulation of Mad2 and overexpression of survivin or Aurora B are associated with human cancer and resistance
toward chemotherapy (12, 13, 30, 37, 44). Although it is currently
unknown whether low Mad2 levels and high survivin or Aurora B
levels occur mutually exclusive or concomitantly in human tumors,
the expression of Mad2 and survivin/Aurora B represents premier
markers to select an appropriate chemotherapeutic strategy.
Moreover, due to their deregulated expression and activity,
survivin and Aurora kinases are attractive targets for chemotherapy. In fact, drugs that interfere with the expression of survivin are
currently developed and undergo clinical trials [e.g., SPC3042
(Santaris Pharma, Hørsholm, Denmark), YM155 (Astellas Pharma,
Tokyo, Japan), and LY21818308 (Isis/Eli Lilly, Carlsbad, CA); ref. 45].
In addition, small-molecule inhibitors for CDK1 (e.g., roscovitine
derivatives) that can modulate the mitotic survivin protein (present
study; refs. 35, 36) as well as potent pharmacologic inhibitors
for the Aurora kinases have been developed and are currently
explored in clinical trials (23, 37, 46). A combination of these
novel compounds with UCN-01 and possibly with taxanes and
kinesin inhibitors is expected to abrogate the survivin/Aurora B–
dependent antiapoptotic pathway without interfering with the
Mad2-dependent proapoptotic pathway and thus potentiates druginduced apoptosis. Therefore, this novel strategy is expected to
greatly enhance the efficacy of these therapies and, accordingly,
future clinical trials combining these drugs are highly desirable.

proteins might have dual functions in regulating the mitotic
checkpoint and apoptotic pathways, whereas other checkpoint
proteins, including Bub1, BubR1, and Mps1, are restricted to
checkpoint functions during mitosis. Thus, the right balance
between death and survival signals during mitosis might be
mediated by specific subsets of spindle checkpoint proteins and
could explain why mitotic cells are especially vulnerable to
chemotherapeutic drugs that perturb this fine-tuned balance.
Interestingly, on Taxol or kinesin inhibitor treatment that
activates the mitotic spindle checkpoint, the subsequent induction
of apoptosis is dependent on both the activation of the spindle
checkpoint and a subsequent slippage from the mitotic arrest
(11, 12). Because mitotic slippage is associated with the downregulation of survivin (41) and the inactivation of Aurora B (42),
it is expected that exit from mitosis leads to an inactivation of
the antiapoptotic pathway of survivin/Aurora B and, thus, to the
induction of apoptosis in the postmitotic G1 phase due to the
proapoptotic activity of Mad2.
In contrast to spindle-damaging drugs, abrogation of the G2
checkpoint by UCN-01 leads to the induction of a mitotic form of
apoptosis without an apparent requirement for mitotic slippage,
which might be the result of a strong Mad2-mediated proapoptotic
signal that cannot completely be repressed by the antiapoptotic
pathway. However, the rate of UCN-01–induced apoptosis is relatively low and can greatly be enhanced by genetic ablation of
survivin or by treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors of CDK1
and Aurora B kinase, which results in decreased survivin levels.
Although an antiapoptotic function of survivin is well established and direct interactions of survivin with caspases have been
shown (13), it is still controversial how survivin acts as an inhibitor
of apoptosis. Intriguingly, on G2 checkpoint abrogation, we found
that the survivin level, but not the mitotic arrest per se, is tightly
associated with the hyperphosphorylation of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl-2 and with a mitotic inactivation of the proapoptotic
Bax, suggesting that survivin might act upstream of the mitochondria. In this model, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl-2 associated
with an inactivation of Bax would protect cells with high survivin
levels from apoptosis. Indeed, it has been shown recently that
phosphorylated Bcl-2 shows a higher protein stability and an
enhanced antiapoptotic activity (32–34). Moreover, on kinesin
inhibitor treatment, Bax is activated only after cells have exited
mitosis (11), which coincides with a reduced level of survivin (41)
and the initiation of apoptosis.
During mitosis, survivin interacts with inner centromere protein,
borealin, and Aurora B within the ‘‘chromosomal passenger
