ABSTRACT
Triptolide and celastrol are two main active compounds isolated from Thunder
God Vine with the potent anticancer activity. However, the anticancer effect of
triptolide in combination with celastrol is still unknown. In the present study, we
demonstrated that the combination of triptolide with celastrol synergistically induced
cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis with the increased
intracellular ROS accumulation in cancer cells. Pretreatment with ROS scavenger
N-acetyl-L-cysteine dramatically blocked the apoptosis induced by co-treatment with
triptolide and celastrol. Treatment with celastrol alone led to the decreased expressions
of HSP90 client proteins including survivin, AKT, EGFR, which was enhanced by the
addition of triptolide. Additionally, the celastrol-induced expression of HSP70 and
HSP27 was abrogated by triptolide. In the nude mice with xenograft tumors, the
lower-dose combination of triptolide with celastrol significantly inhibited the growth
of tumors without obvious toxicity. Overall, triptolide in combination with celastrol
showed outstanding synergistic anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that
this beneficial combination may offer a promising treatment option for cancer patients.

3 (ERCC3, also known as XPB), and inhibits its DNAdependent ATPase activity, which leads to the inhibition
of RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription and likely
nucleotide excision repair [15]. Celastrol has been identified
as a novel inhibitor of HSP90 and displays anticancer activity
by inducing the degradation of HSP90 client proteins,
such as AKT, EGFR, CDKs, IAPs and p53, etc [16, 17].
The identification of XPB and HSP90 as the target of
triptolide and celastrol respectively accounts for the majority
of their known biological activities.

INTRODUCTION
Triptolide (Figure 1A) and celastrol (also known
as tripterine, Figure 1B) are two main compounds from
Thunder God Vine (also known as Tripterygium wilfordii
and Lei Gong Teng) with a broad range of bioactivities,
especially anticancer activity [1]. Numerous studies have
reported that both triptolide and celastrol have the anticancer
effects by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [2–14]. Mechanistically,
triptolide directly binds to the subunit of transcription factor

Combination therapy is the routine strategy of cancer
chemotherapy with significant advantages including lower
treatment failure rate and slower development of drug
resistance, [18]. It has reported that triptolide could sensitize
cancer cell lines to several chemotherapeutic drugs in vivo
and in vitro, including cisplatin, adriamycin, temozolomide
and sorafenib, etc [2, 4, 6, 19]. Celastrol in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents also show the synergistic
anticancer effect on suppressing the proliferation of
multiple type of cancers such as melanoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma, breast cancer and lung cancer. [20–23]. Although
triptolide and celastrol coexist in Thunder God Vine and
have the different anticancer molecular mechanisms, the
anticancer effect of triptolide in combination with celastrol
is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the
combination of triptolide with celastrol had the synergistic
anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo, which might be due
to their complementary anticancer molecular mechanisms.

cycle arrest, cell cycle distribution was assessed by FCM with
PI staining. As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, either triptolide
or celastrol alone treatment induced the accumulation in
G2/M phase and reduction in G0/G1 phase of cell population
in both H1299 and H157 cancer cell lines, and co-treatment
with triptolide and celastrol induced the more significant
accumulation in G2/M phase and reduction in G0/G1 phase
of cell population in both cancer cell lines. To investigate
the molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest by triptolide
and celastrol, the cell cycle related proteins were detected
by Western blot. The results showed that the protein levels
of Cdk1, Cyclin B and p21, which control the transition of
G2/M phase, were increased mildly in triptolide or celastrol
alone group and dramatically in the combination group of
triptolide with celastrol. Additionally, the protein levels of
Cdk2/4/6, Cyclin D/E, pRb, Rb and p27 were decreased
moderately in either triptolide or celastrol alone group and
significantly in the combination group of triptolide with
celastrol (Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S1). Taken
together, our data indicate that triptolide and celastrol can
synergistically induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in cancer cells.

RESULTS
Triptolide and celastrol synergistically inhibit the
growth of cancer cells in vitro

Triptolide and celastrol synergistically induce
cancer cell apoptosis

To assess the synergistic effect of triptolide and
celastrol on cancer cells, cell survival was detected by MTT
assay. As shown in Figure 1, the survival of all used cancer
cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner in vitro after
either triptolide or celastrol treatment. The IC50 values of
triptolide and celastrol in these cells were range from 7.00
to 123.86 nM and 1.53 to 6.44 μM, respectively. However, in
human normal embryonic kidney HEK293T cells triptolide
slightly inhibited cells growth with the IC50 > 1000 nM which
is significantly higher than those of cancer cells, and celastrol
considerably inhibited cells growth with the IC50 2.99 μM
which are equal to those of cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure S1A). After co-treatment with triptolide (3, 10 and
30 nM) and celastrol (0.3, 1 and 3 μM), the survival of
cancer cells were significantly reduced in comparsion with
triptolide or celastrol alone treatment. Almost all CI values
of combination in cancer cells were <1, suggesting that the
antigrowth effect of triptolide in combination with celastrol
in the indicated cancer cells is synergistic rather than additive
(Figure 1C, 2 and Supplementary Figure S2). Nevertheless,
only small part of CI values of combination in HEK293T cells
were <1, suggesting that the synergistic effect of triptolide in
combination with celastrol in normal cells is not significant as
that in cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S1B).

In addition to the evaluation of triptolide in combination
with celastrol induced growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest,
their effects on apoptosis were analyzed by microscopy and
FCM. As shown in Figure 4A, either triptolide or celastrol
alone treatment conduced a few cells undergoing apoptosis
with a characteristic morphology such as cell shrinkage
and rounding in both H1299 and H157 cancer cell lines,
and co-treatment with triptolide and celastrol conduced
more apoptosis in both cancer cell lines. The apoptosis was
further quantified by FCM with Annexin V/PI staining. The
results showed triptolide or celastrol alone treatment caused
moderate apoptosis including early (Annexin V positive and
PI negative) and late (Annexin V positive and PI postive)
apoptosis in both H1299 and H157 cancer cell lines, and
co-treatment with triptolide and celastrol caused significant
total apoptosis in both cancer cell lines (Figure 4B and 4C).
To investigate the molecular mechanism of cell apoptosis
by triptolide and celastrol, the apoptotic related proteins
were detected by Western blot. As shown in Figure 4D
and Supplementary Table S1, the markers of apoptosis, the
cleaved PARP and Caspase-3, were clearly generated in
the co-treatment group compared with either single drug
group. Furthermore, the combination group of triptolide with
celastrol showed the obvious decreased expression levels
of pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and Bcl-XS/L and
anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, survivin and
XIAP in comparison with triptolide or celastrol alone group.
In conclusion, these results suggested that triptolide and
celastrol can synergistically induce cancer cells apoptosis.

ROS is critical for the synergistic anticancer
effects of triptolide and celastrol

combination with celastrol, we silenced the expression of
HSP70 and HSP27 alone or combination by transfection of
their specific siRNA into both H1299 and H157 cells. The
results showed that in H1299 cells knockdown of HSP70
and HSP27 alone or combination by siRNA significantly
enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of triptolide
and celastrol alone or combination, and in H157 cells
only knockdown of both HSP70 and HSP27 by siRNA
significantly enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of
triptolide and celastrol alone or combination (Figure 6D).

ROS plays a critical role in mediating numerous
anticancer agents executing anticancer effects [24]. We
next assess the role of ROS in the synergistic anticancer
effects of triptolide and celastrol. Dihydroethidium (DHE)
is a classic ROS fluorescent probe, which can penetrate
through living cell membrane freely and be oxidized by
intracellular ROS to oxide ethidium that conjugated with
DNA to emit the detectable red fluorescence [25]. As shown
in Figure 5A and 5B, compared with triptolide or celastrol
alone treatment, co-treatment with triptolide and celastrol
prominently led to the enhancement of DHE fluorescent
intensities in both H1299 and H157 cancer cells, suggesting
the intracellular ROS levels of co-treatment group were
significantly higher than those of either single drug group
in both cancer cells. Previous studies have showed that
ROS levels positively correlate with cell apoptosis, and
the antioxidative agent NAC can prevent the production of
ROS to suppress cell apoptosis [25]. To further investigate
the relationship between the ROS generation and apoptosis
induced by the combination of triptolide with celastrol, cells
were co-treated with triptolide and celastrol for 24 h in the
presence or absence of 3 mM NAC pretreatment for 1 h.
The cell apoptosis was detected by FCM with Annexin V/
PI staining, and the results demonstrated that cell apoptosis
of the combination therapy was mostly blocked by NAC
in both H1299 and H157 cancer cells (Figure 5C and 5D).
In brief, these data indicate that ROS is critical for the
synergistic anticancer effects of triptolide and celastrol.

Triptolide and celastrol synergistically inhibit
xenograft tumor growth in nude mice
To examine the synergistic antitumor effects of
triptolide and celastrol in vivo, we generated the xenograft
tumor models by transplanting H1299 and H157 cancer cells
into nude mice. As shown in Figure 7A–7C, compared with
triptolide or celastrol alone treatment, co-treatment with
triptolide and celastrol significantly inhibited the growth of
both H1299 and H157 tumors by diminishing the volume and
weight of tumors. The inhibition rates of tumor growth in the
co-treatment group were 49.8% (H1299) and 62.3% (H157)
respectively, which were obviously higher than those in either
single treatment group (Figure 7D). In addition, the weight of
mice did not show the statistical difference between before
and after experiments in each group, suggesting neither
single treatment nor co-treatment of triptolide and celastrol
resulted in significant side effects in mice (Figure 7D). In
short, these results indicate that triptolide and celastrol can
synergistically inhibit tumor growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION

Combinational effect of triptolide and celastrol
on heat shock proteins and their client proteins

Natural products play an important role in the
prevention and treatment of cancer and other disease in the
world [26–28]. In the present study, we demonstrated that
the combination of triptolide with celastrol synergistically
induced cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G2/M
phase and apoptosis with the increased intracellular ROS
accumulation in cancer cells. It has reported that triptolide
can induce ROS generation and subsequently result
in cancer cells apoptosis, and pretreatment with ROS
scavenger NAC only partially suppresses triptolide-induced
apoptosis, suggesting triptolide is able to induce both ROS
dependent and independent apoptosis [29]. Treatment with
celastrol also enhances the intracellular ROS generation to
trigger apoptosis in cancer cells, while blocking of ROS
accumulation with NAC completely inhibits celastrolinduced apoptosis, suggesting celastrol only induce ROS
dependent apoptosis [30, 31]. In our case, co-treatment with
triptolide and celastrol prominently led to the enhancement
of intracellular ROS in comparisonwith either single
drug treatment in cancer cells, and NAC pretreatment
dramatically but not totally blocked the apoptosis induced
by co-treatment with triptolide and celastrol. Our findings

To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of the
synergistic anticancer effects of triptolide and celastrol, we
focused on the molecular targets of triptolide and celastrol,
especially heat shock proteins (HSPs) and their client
proteins by detecting their protein levels with Western
blot. As shown in Figure 6A, triptolide alone treatment
dose- and time-dependently reduced the protein levels of
HSP27, HSP70, HSP90 and its client protein survivin in
both H1299 and H157 cancer cells. However, celastrol
alone treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner
decreased the protein levels of survivin, but increased
the protein levels of HSP27 and HSP70 in both cancer
cells (Figure 6B). Moreover, the addition of triptolide
prevented the increase of HSP27 and HSP70 proteins by
celastrol, and synergized with celastrol to decrease the
protein levels of HSP90, co-chaperone proteins CDC37
and AHA1, client proteins survivin, EGFR, RAF1, AKT,
MDM2, β-catenin, and other proteins E-Cadherin and p65
(Figure 6C) and Supplementary Table S1. To investigate

indicate that co-treatment with triptolide and celastrol can
induce both ROS dependent and independent apoptosis,
which may be due to the above different roles of ROS in
triptolide- and celastrol-induced apoptosis.
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are commonly over­
expressed in a wide variety of cancers, and high levels
of HSPs are closely associated with poor prognosis and
treatment resistance in cancer patients as these proteins
protect cancer cells against the toxic effects of genomic
instability, aberrant microenviroment and therapeutic
stressors including radiotherapy, thermotherapy and
chemotherapy [32]. Therefore, targeting HSPs has recently
emerged as a promising potential anticancer strategy. It
has demonstrated that triptolide is an inhibitor of HSPs
transcription which leads to enhancement of stress-induced
cell death [33]. Triptolide can inhibit both mRNA and
protein levels of HSP70, and induce apoptosis in HSP70
overexpressed pancreatic cancer cells [7]. Celastrol
directly inhibits HSP90 activity but stressedly induce the
upregulation of HSP70 [5, 34]. In our study, treatment
with celastrol alone resulted in the decreased expressions
of HSP90 client proteins including survivin, AKT, EGFR,
etc, which was enhanced by the addition of triptolide.
Additionally, the celastrol-induced upregulation of HSP70
and HSP27 was abrogated by triptolide. Furthermore,
knockdown of HSP70 and HSP27 enhanced the antigrowth
effects of triptolide in combination with celastrol. As two
main stress-inducible HSPs, HSP70 and HSP27 are two
powerful chaperones which inhibit critical effectors of the
apoptotic machinery to allow cell survival under stress
conditions, and overexpression of HSP70 or HSP27 in cancer
cells drive cancer growth, treatment resistance and metastatic
potential [35]. Therefore, downregulation of the celastrolinduced expression of HSP70 and HSP27 by triptolide may
be an important mechanism of the synergistic anticancer
effects of triptolide and celastrol. In addition, inhibition
of HSP90 client proteins and induction of the intracellular
ROS accumulation can be other reasons for the synergistic
anticancer effect of triptolide and celastrol (Figure 8).
In summary, our studies provide strong evidence
that combinational treatment with triptolide and celastrol
at low concentration synergistically inhibit cancer cells
growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro
and in vivo. Triptolide in combination with celastrol shows
outstanding synergistic anticancer effect, suggesting this
beneficial combination may offer a promising treatment
option for cancer patients.

A student’s t-test was used to compare individual
data points among each group. A P-value of <0.05 was set
as the criterion for statistical significance.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold
PBS, then resuspended and lysed in RIPA buffer (1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 ng/ml
PMSF, 0.03% aprotinin, 1 μM sodium orthovanadate) at
4°C for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at
14,000 × g and supernatants were stored at −80°C as whole
cell extracts. Total protein concentrations were determined
with Bradford assay. Thirty μg proteins of each sample
were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were
blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with the indicated
primary antibodies. Corresponding horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies were used against
each primary antibody. Proteins were detected using the
chemiluminescent detection reagents and films [45, 46].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No, there is no conflict of interest.

Nude mice xenograft tumor assay
Balb/c nude mice were obtained from the
Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center and
maintained with sterilized food and water. Six female
nude mice with 5 weeks old and 20 g weight were used
for each group. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously
with H1299 or H157 cells (3 × 106 in 100 μl of medium)
under the shoulder. When the subcutaneous tumors were
approximately 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 (two perpendicular diameters)
in size, mice were randomized into four groups, and were
injected intraperitoneally with vehicle alone (0.9% saline),
triptolide alone (0.4 mg/kg), celastrol alone (2 mg/kg), or a
combination of triptolide and celastrol every two day. The
body weights of mice and the two perpendicular diameters
(A and B) of tumors were recorded. The tumor volume (V)
was caculated according to the formula:
A+B 3
π
V=
=a
b
6
2
The mice were anaesthetized after experiment, and
tumor tissue was excised from the mice and weight. The
rate of inhibition (IR) was calculated according to the
formula [47]:
Mean tumor weight of experimental group
IR = 1 −
× 100%
