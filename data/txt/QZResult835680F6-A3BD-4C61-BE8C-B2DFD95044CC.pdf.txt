Summary

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The RAS/MAPK-signalling pathway is frequently deregulated in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), often through KRAS activating mutations1-3. A single endogenous mutant Kras allele is
sufficient to promote lung tumour formation in mice but malignant progression requires additional
genetic alterations4-7. We recently showed that advanced lung tumours from KrasG12D/+;p53-null
mice frequently exhibit KrasG12D allelic enrichment (KrasG12D/Kraswild-type>1)7, implying that
mutant Kras copy gains are positively selected during progression. Through a comprehensive
analysis of mutant Kras homozygous and heterozygous MEFs and lung cancer cells we now show
that these genotypes are phenotypically distinct. In particular, KrasG12D/G12D cells exhibit a
glycolytic switch coupled to increased channelling of glucose-derived metabolites into the TCA
cycle and glutathione biosynthesis, resulting in enhanced glutathione-mediated detoxification. This
metabolic rewiring is recapitulated in mutant KRAS homozygous NSCLC cells and in vivo, in
spontaneous advanced murine lung tumours (which display a high frequency of KrasG12D copy
gain), but not in the corresponding early tumours (KrasG12D heterozygous). Finally, we
demonstrate that mutant Kras copy gain creates unique metabolic dependences that can be
exploited to selectively target these aggressive mutant Kras tumours. Our data demonstrate that
mutant Kras lung tumours are not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous group comprised of
two classes of tumours with distinct metabolic profiles, prognosis and therapeutic susceptibility,
which can be discriminated based on their relative mutant allelic content. We also provide the first
in vivo evidence of metabolic rewiring during lung cancer malignant progression.
The Ras pathway8 is frequently upregulated during the malignant progression of mutant
Kras tumours5,9, indicating that this transition requires further increased Ras activity. But
how this activity may contribute to malignant progression remains unclear. We recently
identified mutant Kras (Krasmut) copy gains in high-grade murine lung tumours7 and

mutant-specific gains have also been reported in NSCLC2,10. We thus hypothesized that the
gain of a second Krasmut copy affords additional oncogenic phenotypes to Kras
heterozygous cells. To identify such potential gain-of-function phenotypes, we compared the
acute impact of KrasG12D-endogenous allele11 activation in heterozygous and homozygous
KrasG12D mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs were generated on a p53-null
background12 (Extended Data Fig. 1a) to recapitulate the tumour genotype where KrasG12D
copy gains were identified7 but for simplicity, hereafter they will be termed
Kraswild-type/wild-type (WT/WT), KrasG12D/WT and KrasG12D/G12D.
As reported11, KrasG12D/WT cells showed a proliferative advantage relative to KrasWT/WT
MEFs. Surprisingly, KrasG12D/WT and KrasG12D/G12D cells grew similarly at early passages
(P1-P5) (Fig. 1a,b), indicating that proliferation is not directly affected by Krasmut copy
gain. A growth advantage of KrasG12D/G12D cells was nevertheless observed after P6. To
identify both immediate and proliferation-independent KrasG12D copy gain-dependent
effects subsequent analyses were restricted to early passages. While KRAS amplifications
are typically associated with increased expression2,10, KrasG12D/WT and KrasG12D/G12D Ras
protein levels were comparable and only slightly increased relative to KrasWT/WT MEFs.
Nevertheless, KrasG12D/G12D MEFs exhibited a ~2-fold increase in activated Ras relative to
KrasG12D/WT cells (Fig. 1c), indicating that mutant copy gain may have functional
implications. In agreement, microarray analysis identified 1666 genes differentially
regulated (>1.3 fold) between KrasG12D/G12D and KrasG12D/WT MEFs, with glycolysis being
the most significantly altered pathway (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig.1b).

Mutant Kras activity enhances glucose uptake and rewires glucose metabolism into the
hexosamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma13. However, its metabolic impact on other cancer types and more
importantly, that of Krasmut copy gain is unclear. KrasG12D/WT and KrasWT/WT MEFs
showed similar glycolytic gene expression profiles with the exception of Slc2a1 (Glut1) and
Slc2a3 (Glut3, data not shown). In contrast, in KrasG12D/G12D MEFs glycolytic gene
expression was significantly upregulated and mirrored by increased glucose uptake, lactate
secretion and glycolytic capacity (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Thus, we show
that KrasG12D copy gain induces a glycolytic switch while a Kras mutation per se is not
sufficient to upregulate glycolysis. Notably, analysis of murine lung tumour cell lines with
distinct Kras G12D/WT allelic content revealed a direct correlation between increased
KrasG12D copy number (KrasG12D/total Kras) and enhanced GTPase activity and glycolysis
(ECAR), consistent with a “Krasmut-dosage” effect. Glycolytic gene expression, glucose
uptake and lactate secretion were also significantly enhanced in KrasG12D/G12D relative to
heterozygous tumour cells (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1e-g). Importantly, Krasmut
homozygosity is highly prevalent (48.6%) within mutant KRAS NSCLC cell lines
(COSMIC), underscoring its relevance and enabling the validation of our findings in a
clinically relevant NSCLC model. Reassuringly, the distinct glycolytic phenotypes of
KRASmut heterozygous and homozygous cells were confirmed in NSCLC cells (Fig. 1h and
Extended Data Table 1), demonstrating that glycolysis upregulation is a Krasmut copy gainassociated gain-of-function.

Enhanced glycolysis is a well-recognised cancer phenotype typically associated with
increased growth demands, and/or compensatory adaptation to mitochondrial defects14,15.
Yet, early passage KrasG12D/G12D MEFs displayed a glycolytic switch relative to
KrasG12D/WT cells despite exhibiting comparable proliferative rates, cell volume, diameter,
protein and RNA content (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 2a-d). Furthermore,
mitochondrial morphology and function were similar across genotypes (Extended Data Fig.
2e-h), despite a KrasG12D-associated decrease in membrane potential, as reported under
overexpression conditions15,16. We then hypothesised that this glycolytic switch reflected
alternative glucose utilization by KrasG12D/G12D cells. Metabolomics analysis confirmed the
enhanced glycolytic phenotype of KrasG12D/G12D cells and unexpectedly, uncovered a
significant increase in glucose-derived TCA cycle metabolites in Krasmut homozygous
MEFs and (murine and human) lung tumour cells (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3,4),
confirming their intact mitochondrial function. More importantly, these data identified a
Krasmut copy gain-specific metabolic rewiring and uncovered a (TCA-coupled) glucose
metabolism signature not previously associated with mutant Kras activity.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Despite their differential glucose utilisation, KrasG12D/WT and KrasG12D/G12D MEFs had
similar oxidative phosphorylation levels (Extended Data Fig.2e), hinting to additional TCA
cycle differences. Since Krasmut cells were reported to preferentially utilise glutamine, rather
than glucose, to fuel the TCA cycle17,18 glutamine metabolism was assessed. Glutaminederived TCA cycle metabolites were increased in KrasG12D/WT cells and glutamine-derived
oxygen consumption was also enhanced in KrasG12D/WT, but not KrasG12D/G12D, relative to
KrasWT/WT MEFs (Extended Data Fig.5a-j). However, unlike the genotype-specific glucose
metabolism signatures, differential glutamine utilisation could not be consistently
recapitulated in tumour cells (data not shown), possibly reflecting their proliferative and
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) heterogeneity. Thus, KrasG12D/WT-specific glutamine
metabolism rewiring is either MEF-specific or masked by other mutations in cancer cells.
Enhanced pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh) activity19 could explain the glucose metabolism
reprogramming exhibited by homozygous cells. But since KrasG12D/G12D and KrasG12D/WT
MEFs showed comparable Pdhe1a expression and Pdh activity (Fig. 3a) we speculated that
instead, genotype-specific metabolic requirements drive this metabolic switch. Surprisingly,
our metabolomics data showed that glutathione (GSH) and its precursors serine, glycine and
glutamate were strikingly enriched with glucose-derived carbons in Krasmut homozygous
cells (Figure 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3c-e,i,4d-f,h,l,m), implying that Krasmut copy gain
rewired glucose metabolism towards glutathione biosynthesis. Even glutamine was more
efficiently metabolised towards GSH biosynthesis in KrasG12D/G12D MEFs (Extended Data
Fig. 5g,k). We therefore assessed the impact of KrasG12D-gain on redox management.
Consistent with previous reports18,20, KrasG12D/WT MEFs showed decreased ROS levels and
increased NADPH/NADP+ ratio relative to KrasWT/WT. Nevertheless, KrasG12D/G12D MEFs
exhibited a more striking antioxidant signature, marked by significantly increased NADPH
and GSH synthesis, NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios and conversely, lower ROS
levels and increased resistance to ROS-inducing agents (H2O2) (Fig. 3b-e and Extended Fig.
6a). Mutant Kras was previously associated with enhanced expression and activity of the
antioxidant programme regulator Nrf221 in KrasG12D/WT;p53+/+ MEFs20, potentially
explaining the increased redox potential of our KrasG12D/G12D;p53−/− MEFs. Despite

exhibiting comparable Nrf2 expression to heterozygous (Fig. 3f), KrasG12D/G12D MEFs
showed upregulation of Nrf2-regulated GSH utilisation genes21, indicating that increased
Nrf2-mediated detoxification may contribute to their metabolic rewiring.

The metabolic heterogeneity of Krasmut cells can potentially limit the efficacy of generalised
targeting approaches22, prompting us to explore potential Krasmut copy number-dependent
susceptibilities. Unlike heterozygotes, KrasG12D/G12D MEFs were very sensitive to low
glucose levels and the glucose analogue 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), which induced a
dramatic apoptotic response (Fig. 3g,h). In turn, KrasG12D/WT MEFs showed higher
sensitivity to low glutamine. Confirming a reliance on glucose for efficient ROS
management, KrasG12D/G12D cells (but not KrasWT/WT or KrasG12D/WT) showed increased
ROS levels upon 2DG treatment, while N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, GSH precursor) partially
rescued their 2DG-induced apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Moreover, combined 2DG
and L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO, GSH biosynthesis inhibitor23) treatment induced
drastic, KrasG12D/G12D-specific apoptosis and reduction in GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 3h and
Extended Data Fig. 6d). Likewise, murine and human Krasmut homozygous lung cancer cells
exhibited increased GSH levels, GSH/GSSG ratio and enhanced sensitivity to low glucose,
2DG and 2DG/BSO, relative to heterozygotes (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6e-g),
revealing a mutant Kras copy gain-specific susceptibility to glucose and glutathione
depletion in lung cancer cells.

Finally, we defined the metabolic impact of KrasG12D copy gain in vivo using the
spontaneous KrasG12D/+;p53−/− lung tumours where these gains were originally reported7.
These tumours progress over time from low- to high-grade, with KrasG12D gains being
associated with the latter, prompting us to compare glucose flux in early (mostly low-grade)
and late (typically advanced) tumours. Control or tumour-bearing mice were infused
with 13C-glucose and normal lung or individual tumours isolated for LC-MS analysis and
biopsied for Kras locus assessment. Early tumours and control lung showed similar
KrasG12D allelic content (mean 46.7 and 46.2% respectively; Fig. 4a), demonstrating that
early lesions are predominantly heterozygous. In contrast, late tumours showed increased
KrasG12D allelic prevalence (mean >50%), confirming mutant enrichment in advanced
disease7. Importantly, and consistent with our in vitro data, late tumours exhibited an
increase in glucose-derived TCA cycle metabolites, as well as serine, glycine and GSH (Fig.
4b and Extended Data Fig. 7). Notably, by showing that early and late tumours have distinct
metabolic profiles we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of in vivo metabolic
reprogramming during lung cancer malignant progression.

KrasG12D copy gain also drove increased malignancy in MEFs and lung cancer cells (Fig.
4c-e). Accordingly, KrasG12D/G12D MEFs showed a highly penetrant colonisation phenotype
inducing lung tumours in 8/8 recipient mice following intravenous (i.v.) transplantation. In
contrast, none of the KrasWT/WT (n=5, data not shown) and only 1/8 KrasG12D/WT recipients
developed a lung lesion. Similarly, KrasG12D/G12D lung cancer cells exhibited a significantly
increased metastatic potential relative to heterozygous cells, establishing a direct link
between Krasmut gains and lung cancer malignancy.

Lastly, we defined the therapeutic impact of glucose metabolism rewiring in vivo by treating
early and late lung tumours with 2DG+BSO. Similarly to MEFs and lung cancer cells, late
tumours (where KrasG12D allele prevalence is increased (Fig. 4a)), were significantly more
sensitive than early tumours to 2DG+BSO treatment (Fig. 4f). Thus, despite the presence of
a KrasG12D allele (and p53 inactivation) in both groups and their comparable proliferation
(Fig. 4f, CTRL), low and high-grade lung tumours have distinct and mutant Kras copy
number-dependent therapeutic susceptibilities.

Kras allelic imbalance7 and mutant Kras upregulation9 were shown to select for p53
inactivation and correlate with tumour progression but the oncogenic effects of enhanced
mutant Kras signalling remained unclear. Here we show that even in the absence of p53,
KrasG12D/WT and KrasG12D/G12D cells are phenotypically distinct, with mutant Kras copy
gain driving gain-of-functions that include upregulation and reprogramming of glucose
metabolism, enhanced ROS management and increased metastatic potential. It is possible
that loss of the KrasWT allele contributes to the phenotypes observed in KrasG12D/G12D
cells24,25. However, since the majority of advanced murine lung tumours retain the wild-type
allele (Fig. 4a) we argue that mutant Kras gains are the more likely target of positive
selection during lung cancer progression. In agreement, KRASWT-loss is uncommon while
mutant and wild-type KRAS gains are frequent features of mutant KRAS human lung
adenocarcinoma2,10,26.

Importantly and consistent with our findings, TCGA copy number variation (CNV) and
RNAseq data analysis of 65 mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinomas1 revealed that, despite
likely allelic gain heterogeneity10, combined KRAS mutation and copy gain correlate with
glycolysis and glutathione metabolism pathway upregulation (KRASmut&CG, Fig. 4g and
Extended Data Table 2). These data confirm that mutant KRAS lung tumours are not a
single metabolic entity and that, similarly to murine tumours, they may comprise (at least)
two disease subgroups with distinct genetic and metabolic signatures and unique therapeutic
susceptibilities. We argue that this heterogeneity may have contributed to the poor treatment
responses of KRAS mutant tumours and hence, that combined quantitative and qualitative
KRAS locus assessment may have both prognostic and therapeutic utility.

Methods
Mice, adenoviral infection and treatments
Animals were maintained under SPF conditions and in compliance with UK Home Office
regulations. KrasLSL-G12D (6) mice were crossbred to p53Fx (12) to obtain mixed background
(C57Bl/6/129/Sv) KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53Fx/Fx (for spontaneous tumours and MEF generation)
or Kras+/+,p53+/+ (transplantation recipients) mice. Endogenous lung tumours were
generated through intranasal administration of 8-10 week-old KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53Fx/Fx mice
(termed KrasG12D/WT;p53null) with Cre-expressing adenovirus (5 × 107 plaque-forming units
per mouse, University of Iowa Vector Core, USA), as previously described7. For therapeutic
studies tumour bearing mice were treated 12 (early group) or 16 weeks (late group) after Cre
administration with a combination of 1000 mg/kg 2DG and 10 mmol/kg BSO or vehicle
(saline) once a day for 2 days (i.p.). Lungs were collected 24 hrs after the last treatment and

formalin fixed (of note: 2DG+BSO treatment was sometimes associated with a temporary
decrease in motility in both control and tumour bearing mice).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For transplantation studies 8-12 week-old syngeneic wild-type mice were sub-lethally
irradiated (4Gy, Cesium source) 6 hrs prior to tail vein injection with 1×105 cells in 100 μl
PBS. Baseline luminescence values were collected 24 hrs after transplantation and tumour
growth monitored weekly by bioluminescence imaging following i.p. injection with Dluciferin (150 mg/kg) using an IVIS Spectrum Xenogen machine (Caliper Life Sciences).
Relative luciferase activity corresponds to change from baseline at indicated timepoint,
normalised to blank control (luciferase-negative animal). For tumour load analysis lungs
were collected 3 weeks after transplantation while tumour survival represents the onset of
moderate signs of disease. Two independent MEFs per genotype were used in
transplantation studies (four recipients/MEF line). Lung cancer cell lines (L1211 and L1212)
were each transplanted onto five (tumour load study) or nine recipient mice (survival). All
studies involved animals of both sexes and no animals were excluded from the analysis.
Cohort sizes were calculated based on published data7 and pilot studies and animals
randomised based on gender and age. Tumour analysis was carried out blindly. No tumour
exceeded the maximum size approved by the animal welfare committee/regulations.
Generation and culture of MEFs and tumour cell lines

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For MEF generation, KrasLSL-G12D/+ ;p53Fx/Fx animals were interbred and embryos
collected at day E12.5, to overcome KrasLSL-G12D/G12D embryonic lethality27, and Cremediated recombination performed immediately after MEF generation. In short, cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine for one passage and
then infected with adenovirus-Cre (5 × 107 plaque-forming units/1 × 106 cells). Cremediated recombination was confirmed by PCR. MEF data were typically obtained using 3
independent MEFs/genotype and a minimum of 2 independent MEFs/genotype was used in
all cases. All (short-term) assays were performed in low-passage MEFs (P1-4 post-Cre). For
assessment of proliferative capacity MEFs were cultured under standard 3T3 protocol.
Briefly, at every passage 3 × 105 cells were plated in triplicate on 6 cm plates and counted 3
days later. Cumulative cell number was calculated as Log(Nf/Ni)/Log2, where Ni and Nf
correspond to number of cells plated and final counts/passage, respectively. Murine lung
tumour cell lines were generated from independent, spontaneous “late” lung tumours from
three KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53R270H/ER (6,29) mice. Tumour cells were dissociated by
collagenase/dispase (Roche) treatment and cultured in DMEM/F12 media supplemented
with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine. Human NSCLC cell lines were recently purchased from
ATCC (authenticated) and cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM LGlutamine.
AnnexinV/PI FACS analysis was performed as described28. For BrdU/PI FACS cells were
labelled with 10 mM BrdU (Sigma) for 2 hrs. After harvest, cells were fixed and stained
with FITC-conjugated Anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson), according to
manufacturer’s protocol and resuspended in PBS containing 20 μg/ml of propidium iodide
(PI). FACS was performed using a LSRII (BD, UK) flow cytometer and analysed with
FlowJo software (Treestar, USA). Cell viability following nutrient deprivation and H2O2

administration was determined by trypan blue exclusion (0.4%, Gibco,) or Crystal Violet
(0.2%, Sigma), respectively. For in vivo luciferase imaging MEFs and tumour cells were
transduced with a MSCV-luciferase-hygromycin retrovirus and selected (350μg/ml
hygromycin b) prior to i.v. transplantation. All cells used in this study tested negative for
mycoplasma contamination. In vitro assays were carried out in triplicate and run at least
three independent times.
Ras and Pdh expression and activity
Ras activation was determined by Raf-GST pull-down based ELISA using 100 μg protein/
sample (whole cell lysates) (Merck Millipore, Ras activation Elisa kit, #17-497). Pdh
activity was determined with a Pdh enzyme activity assay kit (#ab109902, Abcam),
according to manufacturers instructions. Immunoblotting (40 μg protein/sample) was
performed with anti-Ras (Cell Signalling, #3339), anti-phospho-Pdhe1a (Ser 293; AP1062;
Calbiochem), total Pdhe1a (9H9AF5; #459400; Life Technologies) or anti-β-Tubulin (Cell
Signalling #2146, loading control) antibodies.
Gene expression profiling, IPA analysis and qPCR validation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Microarray analysis was performed on three independent MEFs/genotype using Illumina
MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Department of Pathology, Cambridge University).
Normalised Log2 values were determined and average Log Fold Change (LogFC) calculated
for each comparison. Pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed (>1.3 fold) between
genotypes was performed using Ingenuity IPA analysis software (ingenuity.com) and
statistical significance (P<0.05) of canonical pathways determined by Benjamini-Hochberg
multiple testing correction. Relative gene expression was depicted by heatmaps generated
using GENE-E software and statistical significance (P<0.05) determined by t-test. Gene
expression changes were validated by qPCR using ROCHE Universal Probe Library System
or Life Technologies probes and all data normalised to 18S expression.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
H&E and Ki67 (Bethyl labs, IHC-00375) IHC was performed on formalin-fixed, 5 μm
paraffin-embedded tissue sections. For transplantation studies the total number of tumours in
a single representative H&E section/animal (minimum of 4 lung lobes/section) is shown. For
endogenous tumours the percentage of proliferating cells was determined as Ki67+/DAPI+
nuclei/tumour from a single representative section/animal (minimum of 4 lung lobes/
section)). All cells or a minimum of 4000 (and >50% coverage) DAPI+ nuclei/tumour were
counted from an average of 5.25 tumours/mouse.
Extracellular flux profiling
OCR and ECAR levels were determined using a Seahorse XFe24 analyser. 2×104 MEFs or
4×104 tumour cells were plated in Seahorse XFe24 assay plates. Immediately prior to
analysis, media was replaced by bicarbonate free DMEM Sigma supplemented with 143
mM NaCl, 2% FBS, and where appropriate, 25 mM Glucose, 4 mM L-Glutamine, pH 7.4
and cells incubated at 37° C for 30 min in a CO2 free incubator. Each cycle of measurement
involved 3 min mixing, 3 min waiting and 3 min measuring. After baseline measurements,

Metabolomics analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In vitro sample preparation: 5×105 MEFs or tumour cells were supplemented with media
containing uniformly labelled 13C- glucose (25 mM) or glutamine (4 mM) for 4 hrs before
sampling. Metabolites were extracted from media (extracellular) and cell pellet
(intracellular) in 50% MeOH: 30% AcetoNitrile: 20% H2O + 100 ng/mL HEPES buffer (1
ml/106 cells). Samples were incubated at 4° C for 15 min at 700 rpm, before centrifugation
at 13,000 rpm. Supernatant was transferred to vials for mass spectrometry analysis. In vivo
sample preparation: KrasG12D/WT;p53Fx/Fx were anaesthetized (isofluorane inhalation) and
administered a bolus of 0.4 mg/g body weight 13C- glucose by tail vein i.v. before
continuous infusion of 0.012 mg/g/min at 150 μl/hrs for 3 hrs. Normal lungs and
independent lung tumours were collected and snap frozen. Samples were transferred to
Precellys24 tubes, metabolite extraction buffer (as above) added (250 μl/10 mg), samples
homogenized, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and supernatant used for mass spectrometry
analysis. Prior to analysis tissues were biopsied for Kras allelic assessment
(pyrosequencing). LC-MS metabolomics: Sequant Zic-pHilic (150 mm × 2.1 mm i.d. 5 μm)
column and guard column (20 mm × 2.1 mm i.d. 5 μm) from HiChrom, Reading, UK were
used for LC separation. Mobile phase A: 20 mM ammonium carbonate plus 0.1% ammonia
hydroxide in water. Mobile phase B: acetonitrile. Flow rate was maintained at 180 μL/
minute and gradient was as follows: 0-1 min 70% of B, 16 min 38% of B, 16.5 min 70% of
B, 25 min 70% of B. Mass spectrometer (Thermo QExactive Orbitrap) was operated in full
MS and polarity switching mode. Samples were randomised in order to avoid machine drifts
and run in triplicate. Spectra were analysed using XCalibur Qual Browser and XCalibur
Quan Browser softwares (Thermo Scientific) by referencing to an internal library of
compounds. Relative metabolite abundance was calculated as percentage of total metabolite
pool, and depicted graphically or as heatmap using GENE-E software. Samples were run
and processed blindly.
Glucose consumption and lactate measurements
For glucose consumption analysis 1×105 MEF or tumour cells were incubated for 1 hr with
fluorescent 6-NBDG (N-23106, Life Technologies, UK) and analysed by FACS (% NBDG
positive cells). Lactate production was assessed 48 hrs after plating using Lactate Reagent
(Trinity Biotech, Ireland), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Total lactate was
normalized to cell number.
TCGA dataset analysis
Lung adenocarcinoma patient TCGA data1 (no restrictions) was downloaded from cBioportal and KRAS mutation and copy number assessed. Tumours with a KRAS mutation

and KRAS GISTIC score of 0+ were taken forward for analysis (n=65). Samples were
divided into two cohorts based on GISTIC classification: KRASmut (mutation only,
GISTIC=0, n=36) or KRASmut&CG (mutation and copy gain, GISTIC=1&2, n=29). KRAS
copy number was calculated (2CNV×2) from SNP6 data. Pathway analysis was carried out
based on RNAseq1 metabolic gene expression data (1430 genes) using IPA software, as
described above.
Reagents
Metabolic probes: 6-NBDG (30 μM), Mitotracker Green (50 nM), TMRM (50 nM), NAO
(200 nM) and Cell Rox deep red (5 μM) were obtained from Life Technologies (UK).
Cellular ROS was determined using CellRox deep red probe (Life Technologies, UK,
C10422) and FACS analysis. GSH/GSSG and NADPH/NADP levels and ratios were
calculated according to manufacturers instructions (Promega, V6611 and G9081,
respectively). Normal and low GLC and GLN (Sigma) correspond to 25 mM and 5 mM, and
4 mM and 0.5 mM respectively. Cells were treated with the following agents, either alone or
in combination as indicated: 100 μM H2O2, 10 mM 2DG and 2 mM (tumour cells) or 5 mM
BSO (MEFs). Total protein content was assessed using Sulforhodamine B (Sigma, 0.057%
w/v), and total RNA content extracted with TRIzol (Life Technologies). NAC (4 mM,
Sigma) was added to cells daily.
Pyrosequencing Analysis
Genomic DNA (from MEFs, tumour cells and tumours) was isolated and Kras WT/mutant
allelic ratio determined by pyrosequencing (PyromarkQ24, Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Pyrograms were analysed (PyroMarkQ24 software) and WT and
mutant Kras allelic frequency determined based on standards (WT:mutant ratios 2:0, 1:1,
0:2) and shown as percentage of total Kras content.

Statistical Analysis
Data was visualised and statistical analyses performed using Prism 5.0 software (Graph Pad)
or R statistical package. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. In all cases,
experimental groups showed comparable variance. P values for unpaired comparisons
between two groups with comparable variance were calculated by two-tailed Student’s t-test.
One-way ANOVA (all groups against wild-type (WT) group) was used for analysis between

three or more groups with comparable variance, followed by Bonferroni post-test for
individual comparisons. Ordinary two-way ANOVA (treatment groups against individual
genotype control group with comparable variance) was used for analysis that involved two
variables, followed by Bonferroni post-test for individual comparisons. Kaplan Meier
comparison was used for analysis of survival cohorts. Pearson’s correlation analysis was
used to compare relationship between variables in groups with similar distribution. TCGA
gene expression data was analysed using negative binomial generalised linear model
(DESeq2). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001. Error bars indicate mean ±s.d. or s.e.m., as
indicated.
