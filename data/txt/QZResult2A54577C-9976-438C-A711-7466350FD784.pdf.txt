Abstract
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells. Mitochondrial CRaf is a potential cancer therapeutic target, as it regulates mitochondrial function and is localized to the mitochondria by its Nterminal domain. However, Raf inhibitor monotherapy can
induce S338 phosphorylation of C-Raf (pC-RafS338) and impede
therapy. This study identiﬁed the interaction of C-Raf with S308
phosphorylated DAPK (pDAPKS308), which together became
colocalized in the mitochondria to facilitate mitochondrial remodeling. Combined use of the Raf inhibitors sorafenib and
GW5074 had synergistic anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo, but
targeted mitochondrial function, rather than the canonical Raf
signaling pathway. C-Raf depletion in knockout MEFC-Raf/ or
siRNA knockdown ACHN renal cancer cells abrogated the cytotoxicity of combination therapy. Crystal structure simulation
showed that GW5074 bound to C-Raf and induced a C-Raf
conformational change that enhanced sorafenib-binding afﬁnity.

In the presence of pDAPKS308, this drug–target interaction compromised the mitochondrial targeting effect of the N-terminal
domain of C-Raf, which induced two-hit damages to cancer
cells. First, combination therapy facilitated pC-RafS338 and
pDAPKS308 translocation from mitochondria to cytoplasm, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation. Second, ROS facilitated PP2A-mediated
dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308 to DAPK. PP2A then dissociated from the C-Raf–DAPK complex and induced profound
cancer cell death. Increased pDAPKS308 modiﬁcation was also
observed in renal cancer tissues, which correlated with poor
disease-free survival and poor overall survival in renal cancer
patients. Besides mediating the anticancer effect, pDAPKS308 may
serve as a predictive biomarker for Raf inhibitors combination
therapy, suggesting an ideal preclinical model that is worthy of
clinical translation. Cancer Res; 75(17); 3568–82. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

therapeutics, which is a step toward personalized clinical and
precision medicine. Besides the canonical Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK
signaling pathway, Raf proteins also participate in the regulation
of mitochondrial function (1). In vascular endothelial cells,
ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF) induces C-Raf mitochondrial
translocation through the phosphorylation of Ser338 (S338) of
C-Raf (pC-RafS338; ref. 2). C-Raf binds directly to the mitochondria through its N-terminal domain to regulate mitochondrial
shape and cellular distribution (3). Such morphologic alterations
in the mitochondrial network are involved in cell migration and
Ca2þ metabolism, which contribute to the oncogenic processes in
cancer cells (4–6). The overexpression of Bcl-2 results in the
recruitment of C-Raf into the mitochondria for cell survival
(1). Mitochondrial targeting of C-Raf confers prosurvival properties that prevent dimerization and phosphorylation of MST2 (7)
and induce the phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD (1),
respectively. Furthermore, both C-Raf and B-Raf can induce some
of the metabolic features mediated by the mitochondria, irrespective of the canonical Raf signaling pathway (7–9).
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of cells and play crucial
roles in regulating the cell signal transduction that contributes to
various anabolic reactions. Thus, they are more important to
cancer cells exhibiting profound modiﬁcations in their energy
metabolism. The unique role of Raf proteins in the mitochondria
provides a strong rationale to target mitochondrial Raf proteins in
cancer therapeutics (1, 10, 11). Although Raf inhibitors have been

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer
causation and progression has led to the development of targeted

C-Raf Colocalizes with DAPK in the Mitochondria

shown to have survival beneﬁts for a variety of cancers, emerging
problems include the lack of long-term therapeutic efﬁcacy and
rapid development of evasive-resistance in the clinics (12–15). Raf
inhibitor monotherapy promotes S338 phosphorylation of C-Raf
and tumor progression (13–15). These facts suggest that Raf
inhibitor monotherapy may paradoxically activate C-Raf in the
mitochondria and impede cancer treatment. Currently, no selective cancer therapeutics that target mitochondrial Raf are available.
Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), a serine/threonine
protein kinase, was identiﬁed by a genetic screen for positive
mediators of cell death (16). It participates in a number of
apoptosis-inducing pathways downstream of interferon-g,
CD95 (Fas), TNFa, and TGFb (17, 18). Besides regulating JNK
signaling, DAPK serves as a mitochondrial sensor to induce
caspase-independent necrotic cell death under oxidative stress
(19). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain
unknown.
The DAPK kinase activity is important for its biologic functions
that mediate cell death processes. The auto-phosphorylation of
the Ser308 (S308) residue of DAPK inhibits its kinase catalytic
activity. Dephosphorylation of S308 of DAPK by PP2A enhances
its kinase activity and promotes cell death processes (20, 21).
Besides S308 phosphorylation of DAPK, other phosphorylation
sites also affect its kinase activity. For instance, ERK and Src kinases
phosphorylate S735 and Y491/Y492, to activate and inhibit the
DAPK kinase activity, respectively (22–24).
DAPK functions as a tumor-suppressor gene, and its expression
is attenuated in many cancer types by promoter hypermethylation
(25). Loss of DAPK kinase function, rather than lack of protein
expression, is also found in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung
cancer, and other types of cancer (26–28). Posttranslational
modiﬁcation, such as S308 phosphorylation of DAPK, may be
one of the reasons for the loss of tumor-suppressor function in
cancers with DAPK expression.
This study determined that C-Raf interacted with pDAPKS308
and directed it to become colocalized to the mitochondria for
regulating mitochondrial remodeling. A novel combination therapy, which used the Raf inhibitors sorafenib and GW5074,
targeted mitochondrial C-Raf and DAPK complexes instead of
the canonical Raf signaling pathway. GW5074 bound to C-Raf
and induced a C-Raf conformational change that enhanced sorafenib-binding afﬁnity. In the presence of pDAPKS308, GW5074
and sorafenib bound to C-Raf and further induced a conformational change of the N-terminal domain, which compromised its
mitochondrial-targeting effect. This facilitated pDAPKS308 and CRaf translocation from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation. ROS-facilitated PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation
of DAPK at S308 activated DAPK, which then dissociated from
C-Raf–DAPK in the cytoplasm, and induced profound cancer cell
necroptosis. An animal model of orthotopic spontaneous metastases of RCC was established to mimic clinical situations. This
model demonstrated the synergistic anticancer effect of the combination therapy in vivo. This study also identiﬁed pDAPKS308 as a
mediator and predictive biomarker of sorafenib and GW5074
combination therapy efﬁcacy for cancer treatment.

C-Raf Colocalizes with DAPK in the Mitochondria

Wright-Giemsa staining
Cells grown on 6-cm dishes were washed in PBS twice and
stained with Giemsa solution (5% Giemsa stain solution, 10%
buffered formalin) for 15 minutes. After decanting the staining
solution, the cells were thoroughly washed in distilled water three
times and air-dried before being photographed.
Sulforhodamine B growth inhibition assays
The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a plating density
of 3,000 cells per well. After 24 to 72 hours with different
drug treatments, the cells were ﬁxed with 10% trichloroacetic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 0.4% sulforhodamine B
(Sigma-Aldrich). The plates were read in a PerkinElmer Victor3
micro-plate reader at 570 nm, as described previously (32).
Triplicate wells per condition were evaluated and the data presented are representative of three independent experiments.
Measurement of ROS
The cells were under single or combined treatment for 24 hours.
Intracellular ROS levels were measured by FACScan ﬂow cytometry using CM-H2DCFDA (10 mmol/L). To detect mitochondrial
superoxide, MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen) staining was following the
manufacturer's protocol. The histograms presented are representative of three separate experiments.

Results
Sorafenib and GW5074 combination therapy induced cancer
cell death in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo
We examined the effects of different Raf inhibitors with dosages
from 2.5 to 10 mmol/L, including sorafenib, GW5074, PLX7420,
and L779450, on the cell viability of ACHN and A498 RCC lines.
Raf inhibitor monotherapy showed low cytotoxicity in ACHN
and A498 RCC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To identify
potential combination therapies with high therapeutic efﬁcacy, 5
mmol/L sorafenib, 10 mmol/L GW5074, 10 mmol/L PLX7420, and
10 mmol/L L779450 were combined in pairs. Sorafenib combined
with either PLX7420 or L779450, and the other combination
therapies, only modestly induced cell death (Fig. 1A). However, a
combination of sorafenib and GW5074 signiﬁcantly induced
ACHN (95%  1.8%) and A498 (78%  2.1%) cell death, as
compared with all other combination therapies (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1B).
The antitumor effect of sorafenib and GW7054 combination
therapy (SG-combination therapy) was further tested in vivo. We
used immunodeﬁcient mice xenografted with ACHN RCC tumors
to test the in vivo antitumor activity and safety of SG-combination
therapy (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1C). In addition, we
generated an orthotopic spontaneous metastatic RCC animal
model in order to mimic clinical situations (Fig. 1C and D and
Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). Luc-ACHN-LL cells with high
metastatic capability and lethality were orthotopically injected
into a renal capsule. Within 2 weeks after the injection, metastatic

lesions were observed under the IVIS Xenogene system. Treatment
with the same protocol as the xenografted experiments was started
(Fig. 1E). SG-combination therapy signiﬁcantly suppressed the
primary and metastatic lesions, and prolonged the survival of
mice (Fig. 1F–H), which remained healthy and active (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Tumors from the mice treated with SG-combination therapy showed severe necrosis compared with tumors
from mice treated with monotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S1G).
Sorafenib and GW5074 combination therapy induced C-Raf–
dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation
Because sorafenib and GW5074 might have cellular targets,
other than C-Raf, that mediate the anticancer effects of SGcombination therapy, we examined whether C-Raf was essential
for the effectiveness of SG-combination therapy. Wild-type MEF
(MEFC-Raf-WT) and C-Raf knockout MEF (MEFC-Raf/) were treated with mono- or SG-combination therapy. SG-combination
therapy synergistically induced cell death of MEFC-Raf-WT (Fig.
2A, right and Supplementary Fig. S2A). However, <32% cell death
of MEFC-Raf/ was observed under SG-combination therapy,
which was similar to sorafenib monotherapy (Fig. 2A, left).
Knockdown of C-Raf, but not B-Raf, in ACHN cells attenuated
cell death induced by SG-combination therapy for 24 hours
from 42.2%  2.5% to 14%  3.2% (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Fig. S2B).
Surprisingly, SG-combination therapy did not prevent S338
phosphorylation of C-Raf (pC-RafS338). In addition, the phosphorylation of the major C-Raf downstream pathway components MEK, ERK, and Akt (33–35) was not inhibited by SGcombination therapy in MEFC-Raf-WT, MEFC-Raf/, ACHN, and
A498 cells (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2C). Because the
combination therapy still increased pC-RafS338, the impact of pCRafS338 on the therapeutic efﬁcacy of combination therapy was
checked (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E). Cell death induced
by the combination therapy was most prominent in ACHN cells
transfected with C-RafS338D (mimicking S338 phosphorylation;
Supplementary Fig. S2F and S2G). In contrast, C-RafS338A (mimicking S338 nonphosphorylation) attenuated the cell death of
ACHN cells under combination therapy (Supplementary Fig. S2F
and S2G). These results indicated that C-Raf was the major target
responsible for the cytotoxic effect of SG-combination therapy.
However, other novel mechanisms mediated by C-Raf, instead of
the canonical Raf signaling pathways, were responsible for the
cytotoxic effects of SG-combination therapy.
Because C-Raf plays an important role in mitochondria, mitochondrial function and ROS production were examined under
mono- or SG-combination therapy. In MEFC-Raf-WT, but not
in MEFC-Raf/, SG-combination therapy resulted in a 6-fold
increase in ROS production, and decreased mitochondrial
membrane potential (Fig. 2D and E and Supplementary Fig.
S3A–S3D). The immunoﬂuorescence assay clearly demonstrated that mitochondrial fragmentation with donut- and
blob-shape formation was induced by SG-combination therapy

C-Raf Colocalizes with DAPK in the Mitochondria

in MEFC-Raf-WT, but not in MEFC-Raf/ (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S3E). The same phenomena were also observed
in ACHN and A498 cells treated with SG-combination therapy
(Fig. 2G and H). Consistent with the aforementioned results
from the cytotoxic experiments, ﬂow cytometry analysis showed an increase of ACHN (53.95%  3.1%) and A498
(64.66%  3.9%) cells with positive staining for both Annexin
V and PI when cells were exposed to SG-combination therapy
for 24 hours (Fig. 2I and Supplementary Fig. S3F). These results
demonstrated that SG-combination therapy induced C-Raf–
dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, which likely contributed
to the profound cell death.
Sorafenib and GW5074 combination therapy induced two-hit
damage of cancer cells through ROS generation and pDAPKS308
dephosphorylation
Recent studies have suggested that DAPK serves as a mitochondrial sensor, which activates and triggers cell death after
dephosphorylation of its S308 by PP2A (20, 36). We observed
that S308 phosphorylation of DAPK (pDAPKS308) was significantly reduced in ACHN, A498, and MEFC-Raf-WT cells after
treatment with SG-combination therapy (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). This reduction in phosphorylation appeared
to be dependent upon C-Raf, as SG-combination therapy
neither induced profound cell death nor dephosphorylted
pDAPKS308 in MEFC-Raf/ (Fig. 3A). We also observed that
PP2A was required for the dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308
induced by SG-combination therapy, as PP2A inhibitors efﬁciently suppressed pDAPKS308 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3B).
Meanwhile, PP2A inhibitors also attenuated the cell death
induced by SG-combination therapy (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4B). The ROS production caused by SG-combination
therapy was not rescued by PP2A inhibitors (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308 by PP2A was a
downstream event to the ROS production.
The ROS scavenger NAC and PEG-SOD erased ROS and attenuated the cell death induced by SG-combination therapy for 24
hours from 46.5%  5.2% to 13.8%  2.6%, and prevented the
dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308 (Fig. 3E and F and Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). However, PP2A inhibitors only attenuated
the cell death induced by SG-combination therapy from 45.03%
 3.6% to 20.32%  4.1% in ACHN cancer cells, which was less
than an attenuation of cell death that caused by the NAC and PEGSOD ROS scavengers (Fig. 3E).
These results indicated that SG-combination therapy caused
two-hit damage in cancer cells. The ﬁrst hit of the SG-combination
therapy induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation.
The second hit was the action of ROS, which facilitated the PP2Amediated dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308 and activated its

death-causing activities. These sequential events caused by SGcombination therapy contributed to the profound cell death.
pDAPKS308 was essential for the anticancer effect of sorafenib
and GW5074 combination therapy
We next wanted to determine whether DAPK or pDAPKS308
levels were essential for the cytotoxicity caused by SG-combination therapy. We assayed the therapeutic efﬁcacy of SG-combination therapy and compared it with the total DAPK and
pDAPKS308 levels of various cell lines. Normal ﬁbroblasts and
epithelial cells had high total DAPK protein, but very low levels of
pDAPKS308, and SG-combination therapy caused low toxicity to
these cells (Fig. 3G, blue bars). Consistent with these results, cell
death induced by SG-combination therapy in different cancer
cells was positively correlated with pDAPKS308 levels, but not with
total DAPK protein levels (Fig. 3G and H).
We further investigated the therapeutic efﬁcacy of SG-combination therapy on cancer cells derived from clinical patient (RCCSor-001; Supplementary Table S1) and animal models (786-OT4, ACHN-T2R; Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C) with evasive resistance to sorafenib monotherapy. SG-combination therapy for 24
hours induced signiﬁcant cell death in these cancer cells (RCCSor-001: 34.6%  2.1%, 786-O-T4: 31.2%  3.2%, ACHN-T2R:
42.3%  5.2%). SG-combination therapy also induced cell death
in HT29 (34.9%  3.7%; ref. 37) and A2058 (44.7%  2.8%;
ref. 38), which have inherited resistance to Raf inhibitors (Fig. 3G,
red bar). All of the resistant cancer cells with sensitivity to SGcombination therapy showed high levels of pDAPKS308. Importantly, because normal cells have low levels of pDAPKS308, SGcombination therapy has the advantage of selective toxicity
toward cancer cells.
DU-145 prostate cancer cells expressed nearly undetectable
total DAPK and pDAPKS308 levels, and did not respond to SGcombination therapy (Fig. 3G). We took advantage of DU-145
cells to examine whether pDAPKS308 (but not DAPK protein)
mediated the cell death induced by SG-combination therapy. DU145 cells overexpressing either DAPKWT (wild-type), DAPKS308D
(mimicking S308 phosphorylation), DAPKS308A (mimicking
S308 nonphosphorylation), and DAPKK42A (kinase-dead), were
treated with SG-combination therapy. Only DAPKS308D enhanced
cell death induced by SG-combination therapy in DU-145 cancer
cells (Fig. 3I and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Furthermore, knockdown of DAPK by siRNA attenuated the cell death induced by SGcombination therapy in ACHN, 786-O, and RCC-Sut-002 cells
that have DAPK expression and pDAPKS308 modiﬁcation (Fig. 3J
and Supplementary Fig. S6B). These results indicated that
pDAPKS308 was essential for the cytotoxicity of SG-combination
therapy, because only cancer cells with pDAPKS308 modiﬁcation
responded to the therapy.

C-Raf Colocalizes with DAPK in the Mitochondria

Combined sorafenib and GW5074 induced pC-RafS338 and
pDAPKS308 cytosolic translocation, mitochondrial
dysfunction, and ROS generation
Because SG-combination therapy was mitochondria-dependent, and C-Raf and pDAPKS308 were essential for the therapeutic
efﬁcacy, we hypothesized that C-Raf and DAPK might be colocalized in the mitochondria. C-Raf and DAPK were localized to
both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria in MEFC-Raf-WT. However, DAPK only localized to the cytoplasm in MEFC-Raf/ (Fig.
4A). SG-combination therapy caused a redistribution of DAPK
and C-Raf from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm in MEFC-Raf-WT,
but not in MEFC-Raf/ (Fig. 4A). In addition, dephosphorylation
of pDAPKS308 was observed after its SG-combination therapyinduced cytoplasmic translocation from the mitochondria. The CRaf protein and its S338 phosphorylation were not affected by SGcombination therapy. The aforementioned results were also noted
in cancer cells with pDAPKS308 modiﬁcation, but not in those
without (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7).
To further investigate the role of pDAPKS308 in SG-combination
therapy-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, wild-type or mutant
forms of DAPK were overexpressed in DU-145 cells that had
undetectable endogenous pDAPKS308 modiﬁcation. Only
DAPKS308D was induced to translocate from the mitochondria
to the cytoplasm, concomitant with mitochondrial dysfunction
and ROS generation in DU-145 cells under SG-combination
therapy [Fig. 4C and D (red rectangle), E and Supplementary Fig.
S8]. Knockdown of DAPK also attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation induced by SG-combination therapy (Fig. 4F). These results indicated that C-Raf directed DAPK to
become colocalized to the mitochondria, and that pDAPKS308 was
essential for the selective toxicity of SG-combination therapymediated mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation in
cancer cells.
Sorafenib and GW5074 combination therapy disassembled the
C-Raf, DAPK, and PP2A complex in the cytoplasm
Because pDAPKS308 played an important role in mediating SGcombination therapy-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, the
role of pDAPKS308 in C-Raf–mediated mitochondrial function
was investigated. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was
shown to activate C-Raf for the regulation of mitochondrial
remodeling (3). PMA treatment induced striking mitochondrial
remodeling with fragmented mitochondria and perinuclear clustering in MEFC-Raf-WT, but not in MEFC-Raf/. DU-145 prostate
cancer cells overexpressing wild-type or DAPK mutants were
treated with PMA. PMA induced signiﬁcantly higher mitochondrial remodeling in DU-145 prostate cancer cells with DAPKS308D
expression, as compared with the other DAPK versions (Fig. 5A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). These results

suggested that pDAPKS308 cooperated with C-Raf to regulate
physiologic cellular function by enhancing mitochondrial
remodeling.
Previous studies showed that PP2A interacts with C-Raf and
DAPK (21, 39). Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays showed that CRaf interacted with DAPK, both in the cytoplasm and in the
mitochondria (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S5C). C-Raf and
DAPK also interacted with PP2A to form a complex in the
cytoplasm. SG-combination therapy reduced the interaction of
PP2A with DAPK and C-Raf, concomitant with the reduction of
pDAPKS308 (Fig. 5D). The IP assay also revealed that DAPKS308D
had a weaker interaction with PP2A than did DAPKWT,
DAPKS308A, and DAPKK42A. SG-combination therapy further
enhanced PP2A dissociation from DAPKS308D (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. S5D).
pDAPKS308 served as a good prognostic biomarker for RCC in
the clinics
Because the pDAPKS308 levels were correlated with the therapeutic efﬁcacy of SG-combination therapy, we investigated the
levels of pDAPKS308 in human cancer tissues. Twenty pairs of RCC
tumor samples and their normal matched counterparts were
examined. By Western blot analysis, 16 out of 20 tumor tissues
showed high pDAPKS308 levels compared with their normal
matched counterparts (Fig. 6A and B). Immunohistochemical
(IHC) analysis of 181 human RCC specimens with tissue arrays
showed that pDAPKS308 level was remarkably higher in cancer
tissues than in normal renal parenchyma (Fig. 6C). There was no
difference in pDAPKS308 level related to tumor grade or clinical
stage (Fig. 6D).
The Kaplan–Meier analysis of patients with survival data
revealed that the high-level of pDAPKS308 positively correlated
with poor disease-free survival and poor overall survival (Fig. 6E
and F and Supplementary Table S2). These results demonstrated
that pDAPKS308 could serve as a good prognostic biomarker for
RCC. It is worthy to investigate whether pDAPKS308 can serve as a
predictive biomarker in the treatment of RCC with SG-combination therapy in clinics.
The three-dimensional structure of sorafenib and GW5074
binding to C-Raf predicted how they induced C-Raf/pDAPKS308
cytosolic translocation
Computerized simulation was performed to evaluate the structure of C-Raf bound with different Raf inhibitors. The predicted
maximal binding energy of inhibitors in complexes with a C-Raf
kinase domain was most prominent in the combination of
GW5074 and sorafenib (182 kcal/mol), compared with other
Raf inhibitors. Prior docking of GW5074 led to a deep binding of
this compound into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile355,

of the protein complex. In contrast, the binding manner for C-Raf
in the DAPKS308D–C-Raf complex model was different. Asp substitution in residue 308 of DAPK changed the interaction between
the two protein interfaces, which led C-Raf to adopt an alternative
stable conformation in which the position of the antiparallel sheet
in the N-terminus of C-Raf was switched to interact with the
binding pocket of DAPK.
These results demonstrated that the combination of GW5074
and sorafenib only induced the conformational change in C-Raf
in the presence of pDAPKS308. This change compromised the
mitochondrial targeting effect of the N-terminal domain of C-Raf,
which triggered the translocation of pC-RafS338 and pDAPKS308
from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. This translocation
resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation. ROS
facilitated PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of pDAPKS308 and
disassociation of PP2A from the C-Raf–DAPK complex in the
cystoplasm. Consequently, DAPK activation in the cytoplasm led
to profound cell death (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
Nonselective off-target mitochondrial toxicity is a major contributor to the failure of chemotherapeutic agents in clinical

www.aacrjournals.org

practice (40, 41). Recent studies of mitochondrial involvement
in cancer have uncovered a plethora of differences in the structure,
genome, and function of these organelles, by comparing metastatic mitochondria with those from nontransformed cells. However, there are limited therapeutic strategies selectively targeting
cancer cell mitochondria (42, 43).
This study revealed that pC-RafS338 interacted with pDAPKS308
and directed it to become colocalized in the mitochondria.
GW5074 and sorafenib combination therapy (SG-combination
therapy) resulted in the translocation of pC-RafS338 and
pDAPKS308 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, concomitant
with a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and
increase in ROS generation. These results suggested that pCRafS338 cooperated with pDAPKS308 in the regulation of mitochondrial function. DU-145 prostate cancer cells with ectopic
DAPKS308D expression were much more sensitive to PMA induced
C-Raf–mediated mitochondrial remodeling, as compared with
cells ectopically overexpressing DAPKWT, DAPKK42A or DAPKS308A
. This conclusion is supported by the observation that only
DAPKS308D, but not DAPKWT, DAPKK42A, and DAPKS308A, could
be induced to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm
by SG-combination therapy, subsequent to the induction of
mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation.

The N-terminal domain of C-Raf is required for its mitochondrial localization (3). Our computer simulation results demonstrated that only in the presence of pDAPKS308, but not wild-type
or other DAPK mutants, sorafenib and GW5074 bound to C-Raf
and induced a conformational change of the N-terminal domain,
which compromised its mitochondrial targeting capability. This
indicated that sorafenib and GW5074 served as C-Raf allosteric
modulators, instead of Raf inhibitors, and provides a platform for
the development of new allosteric modulators in the future.
Therefore, the detailed mechanisms involved in the regulation
of mitochondrial function by pDAPKS308 and C-Raf are biologically important and worthy of further investigation.
The generation of ROS by SG-combination therapy promoted
the PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of S308 in DAPK. It has
been shown that the synthetic retinoid, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)
retinamide (4-HPR), induces ROS production in human leukemia cells (44). The 4-HPR–mediated ROS evokes Akt conformation change by forming an intramolecular disulﬁde bond. Akt is
subsequently dephosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473 by PP2A
(45). Whether this mechanism occurs in this study warrants
further evaluation.
Other important issues regarding DAPK translocation and its
phosphorylation-based regulation need to be explored. Because
HSP90 and 14-3-3 are two chaperone proteins that interact with
and regulate C-Raf phosphorylation status and function (46, 47),
it would be interesting to determine whether these two proteins

3578 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

are also responsible for the regulation of DAPK translocation and
phosphorylation. In addition to S308 phosphorylation of DAPK,
other posttranslational phosphorylation sites also affect its kinase
activity (22). This provides a potential explanation for why
normal cells and some cancer cells expressing very low levels of
pDAPKS308 did not display cell death. The DAPK kinase inactivation in those cells might be attributed to other inhibitory
phosphorylation sites. However, why the S308 residue of DAPK
is phosphorylated in certain types of cancer and whether S308
phosphorylation of DAPK is due to autophosphorylation or other
kinases warrant further studies.
The expression levels of pDAPKS308 in cancer cells or tumor
tissues are crucial for SG-combination therapy efﬁcacy in terms
of clinical cancer treatment. The detection of pDAPKS308 from
cancer tissues would be a prerequisite before the application of
SG-combination therapy. There are higher expression levels of
pDAPKS308 in RCC tumor tissues than in normal renal parenchyma, regardless of tumor grade or clinical stage. These ﬁndings demonstrate that pDAPKS308 is an ideal predictive biomarker for SG-combination therapy in clinical practice, because
only a single factor needs to be assayed in tumor tissues
obtained from either the primary or metastatic lesions. Moreover, because pDAPKS308 also mediated the anticancer effects
of SG-combination therapy by targeting mitochondrial function instead of the C-Raf signaling pathway, it is not necessary
to check upstream Ras or Raf mutation status, or other

compensatory pathways responsible for the inherited or evasive
resistance to Raf inhibitor monotherapy.
The animal model of orthotopic spontaneous RCC metastases
shows high metastatic capability of the kidneys, liver, and brain
within 4 weeks, and lethality within 6 to 8 weeks. The animal
model not only provides an ideal preclinical model to demonstrate the synergistic anticancer effect of SG-combination therapy
in vivo, but can also be used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the high metastases and lethality of phenotypes. Resistant cancer cell lines derived from clinical patients or
animal models under sorafenib or sunitinib monotherapy may
also serve as important research tools for illustrating the underlying mechanisms involved in evasive resistance to anti-VEGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Raf inhibitor monotherapy induced the S338 phosphorylation of C-Raf and promoted tumor progression (13). Therefore, allosteric inhibitors were developed to prevent S338
phosphorylation of C-Raf for cancer treatment in a preclinical
study (48). SG-combination therapy might also induce C-Raf
conformational changes by allosteric regulation mechanisms,
while still inducing the S338 phosphorylation of C-Raf. Our
simulation program predicted two important issues: ﬁrst,
GW5074 bound to C-Raf and induced the conformational
change of C-Raf, which enhanced the binding afﬁnity of
sorafenib to C-Raf; and second, only in the presence of
pDAPKS308 did sorafenib and GW5074 bound to C-Raf alter
its N-terminal conformation, which likely compromised the C-

Raf mitochondrial targeting effect. The biologic function of the
mitochondrial C-Raf/DAPK complex and its allosteric regulation by Raf inhibitors and other potential chemicals need
further investigation.
Our animal model showed that only 20% of regular sorafenib
dosage combined with GW5074 efﬁciently suppressed primary
and metastatic tumors in vivo. This could provide an advantage to
reduce the dose-related side effects of sorafenib in clinical practice
(49). This ﬁnding also raises an important question as to whether
the sequence of drug application of GW5074 and sorafenib has
any impact on the therapeutic efﬁcacy of SG-combination therapy
before its clinical translation. The in vitro data show that the
addition of GW5074 followed by sorafenib has the advantage
of stronger growth inhibition of cancer cells within 24 hours.
However, there is no difference in growth inhibition in terms of
the sequence of drug application of GW5074 and sorafenib when
treating cancer cells over 24 hours (data not shown). The impact
on the sequence of drug application of sorafenib and GW5074 in
clinical patients needs further investigation in thoughtfully
designed clinic trials.
This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel combination therapy with sorafenib and GW5074 for cancer therapy.
These mechanisms by which these two inhibitors interacted with
their target protein, C-Raf, provided an ideal model for a new drug
designation. This study also illuminated a unique interplay
among C-Raf, DAPK, and PP2A in regulating mitochondrial
function in cell death cascades. The safety issue of SG-combination therapy is highly promising due to its selective toxicity toward
cancer cells over normal cells. This study also identiﬁed
pDAPKS308 as a biomarker for predicting the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of SG-combination therapy to prevent unnecessary treatments. A
spontaneous metastatic animal model used to mimic human
cancer disease demonstrated the anticancer efﬁcacy of combination therapy in vivo. This study shows a way to overcome obstacles
encountered in the current cancer therapeutics, and fulﬁlls the
criteria of an ideal preclinical therapeutic model worthy of further
clinical translation.
