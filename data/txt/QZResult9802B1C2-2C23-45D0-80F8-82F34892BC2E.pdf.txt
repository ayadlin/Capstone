Abstract
Topical application of small molecule Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists is highly effective for the treatment
of skin tumors, whereas their systemic application has been largely unsuccessful for cancer therapy. One reason
may be that repeated systemic application of TLR ligands can induce a state of immune unresponsiveness,
termed TLR tolerance. We show here that a single injection of the TLR7 agonist R848 in mice induces a short
period of increased response to TLR stimulation followed by a state of hyporesponsiveness lasting several days.
This state is characterized by inhibited secretion of the key cytokines interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-6 as well as by
a block in IFN-a production. We show for the first time that at the cellular level, TLR7 tolerance occurs in both
plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, two cell populations that play a critical role in the initiation and
amplification of antitumor immune responses. We further show that TLR7 tolerance in plasmacytoid dendritic
cells is accompanied by downregulation of the adaptor protein IL-1 receptor–associated kinase 1. On the basis of
these findings, we have designed a novel strategy for the treatment of tumors by using cycles of repeated R848
injections separated by treatment-free intervals. We show in CT26 tumor-bearing mice that this protocol
circumvents TLR7 tolerance and improves the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Invading pathogens are recognized by the innate immune
system through pattern recognition receptors such as the Tolllike receptor (TLR) family. Ligation of their cognate ligand by
TLR leads to the maturation of immune cells and to the
induction of cytokine and chemokine production (1). Dendritic cells (DC) express many TLRs and therefore play a
critical role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immunity
to pathogens (2). Synthetic TLR agonists can be used pharmacologically to generate strong immune responses and have
been investigated for the immunotherapy of cancer. In particular, the topical administration of small molecule activators
of TLR7 and TLR8 are effective for the treatment of skin

tumors. Topical administration of imiquimod [Aldara (3M
Pharmaceuticals) 5% cream], a synthetic TLR7/8 ligand of the
imidazoquinoline family, is effective as treatment for basal cell
carcinoma (3), lentigo maligna (4), and actinic keratosis (5).
TLR7/8 ligation leads to potent inflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages and myeloid DCs (6) as well as IFN-a
release by plasmacytoid DCs (6, 7).
In patients, the systemic application of TLR7/8 agonists
leads to enhanced production of IFN-a and to activation of
natural killer (NK) cells (8), suggesting a potential therapeutic
benefit in cancer immunotherapy. However, studies investigating the systemic application of TLR7/8 agonists for cancer
therapy are rare. In one study exploring the potential of a
systemic TLR7/8 stimulus (852A) in metastatic melanoma, the
objective antitumor response was low despite 3 weekly applications of 852A and measurable cytokine responses (9). A
recent trial relying on 2 weekly applications of 852A also met
with limited success (10). We reasoned that the phenomenon
of TLR tolerance might restrict the effectiveness of repeated
TLR7/8 stimulation for therapy.
TLR tolerance is a phenomenon initially characterized as
endotoxin tolerance or lypopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance
(11) whereby repeated activation of TLR4 leads to refractoriness toward further stimulation. TLR tolerance was later
shown to affect not only TLR4 but also other TLRs, such as
TLR2 and TLR5 (12, 13). Indeed, TLR7 tolerance has recently
been shown to limit the development of autoimmunity (14),
but whether it plays a role in the outcome of cancer

immunotherapy with TLR7 agonists is not known. Furthermore, although TLR7 tolerance has been described in vitro in
macrophages (13, 15), it is not known whether this effect
occurs in DCs, which are central to cancer immunotherapy.
Here we investigated TLR7 tolerance both in vivo and in vitro
and examined the consequences on DCs, in particular with
respect to the induction of the anticancer cytokines interleukin
(IL)-12p70 and IFN-a. On the basis of our findings, we designed
a treatment protocol to circumvent TLR7 tolerance. This
regimen was effective for the treatment of established experimental tumors in a murine model of colon carcinoma and
proved superior to protocols used previously in clinical studies.

Materials and Methods
Mice, cell lines, and reagents
Female Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were purchased from
Harlan-Winkelmann. J. Heesemann (Max-von-Pettenkofer Institute, Munich, Germany) generously provided IL-10–deficient
mice (C57BL/6 background). All animal studies were approved
by the local regulatory agency (Regierung von Oberbayern). The
murine colon carcinoma cell line CT26 was from Cell Lines
Service and was tested for species and cross-contamination
prior to shipping by real time PCR. Cells were passaged for less
than 6 months according to American Association for Cancer
Research guidelines. Resiquimod (R848) and Malp-2 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. LPS was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. The PTO-modified CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide 1826 (CpG, 50 -TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-30 ) was
obtained from the Coley Pharmaceutical Group. The cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and the COX-2 inhibitor NS 398 was from Tocris.
Recombinant IFN-a was from Miltenyi Biotec.
Generation of DCs
To prepare myeloid DCs, mouse bone marrow cells were
cultured in complete RPMI 1640 (10% fetal calf serum, 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1 IU/mL
penicillin) supplemented with 20 ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 20 ng/mL IL-4 (Tebu
Bio). On day 6 to 7, cells were harvested. Plasmacytoid DCs
were generated from bone marrow cells cultured in complete
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
1% nonessential amino acids (MEM-NEAA), 3.75  104%
2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 ng/mL recombinant Flt3-L (Tebu
Bio). On day 7 to 9, cells were harvested and B220þ cells were
isolated by magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Tumor experiments
For tumor induction, groups of 4 to 5 Balb/c mice were
injected s.c. on day 0 with 2.5  105 CT26 tumor cells.
Treatment was initiated on day 7 to 9. For the generation
of the DC vaccine, myeloid DCs were prepared as described
above and pulsed with g-irradiated (100 Gy) CT26 tumor cells
at a ratio of 5:1 for 24 hours. Subsequently, myeloid DCs were
activated in the presence of 6 mg/mL CpG for an additional 24
hours. A total of 2  105 activated myeloid DCs per mouse
were applied contralaterally followed by treatment with 200

5124

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

mg CpG (half contralaterally and half peritumorally). R848 was
applied s.c. peritumorally at the time points indicated. Tumor
size was expressed as the product of the perpendicular
diameters of individual tumors.
ELISA
Levels of IL-12p70, IL-12p40, IL-6, and IL-10 in murine
serum or cell culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA
according to the manufacturer's protocol (OPTEIA; BD Biosciences). IFN-a was detected by a self-made ELISA set: capture
antibody anti–IFN-a (RMMA-1) and detection antibody anti–
IFN-a (rabbit-anti-mouse polyclonal) were from PBL Biomedical Laboratories, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled
donkey–anti-rabbit was from Biomeda. Detection of the quantitative enzymatic reaction was carried out with the OPTEIA
system.
Western blot
For immunoblotting, cells were harvested and lysed in
NP-40 lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8,
1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmol/L protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Lysates underwent SDS-PAGE and
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE
Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in
PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20). Primary antibodies were diluted
in PBST supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin
fraction V (Sigma-Aldrich); secondary antibodies were diluted
in blocking solution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected
by using a chemoluminescence detection system (ECL, GE
Healthcare). Antibodies used were anti–IRAK-1 (IL-1 receptor–associated kinase; clone F-4) from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, anti–b-actin, and anti-mouse IgG HRP as secondary
antibody from Promega.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism Software, version 5.0b (GraphPad Software). Error bars indicate
SEM. Tumor experiments were statistically analyzed by 2-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttest. Cytokine levels were
analyzed with 1-way ANOVA followed by Dunett's posttest or
2-tailed Student t test as appropriate.

Results
A single injection of the TLR7 agonist R848 leads to
long-lasting immune unresponsiveness
Because the in vivo cytokine response to TLR7 stimulation
with R848 is potent but short-lived (ref. 16; Supplementary
Fig. S1), we hypothesized that repeated applications would
induce more sustained responses that might result in more
effective antitumor immunity. Mice were injected twice with
R848 at intervals from 6 to 120 hours, followed by quantification of serum cytokines 2 hours after the second injection
(Fig. 1A). We found that a single injection of R848 induced a
state of hyperresponsiveness for up to 24 hours. A second
application of R848 6 hours after the first injection resulted in
a 4-fold increase in serum levels of IFN-a, a key cytokine for

the induction of antitumor responses (Fig. 1B). An increase in
IL-6 induction was seen upon R848 stimulation at a 24-hour
interval. In contrast, after 48 hours responsiveness toward the
second stimulation was markedly decreased. IFN-a production
was entirely blocked when mice were restimulated after 48
hours. Sensitivity toward R848 slowly recovered within 5 days.
Hyporesponsiveness was also seen for the induction of IL-12p70
and IL-6 by R848 and lasted for up to 5 days. Interestingly, the
induction of IL-12p40, a subunit of bioactive IL-12, was not
affected by this tachyphylaxis. Thus, a single application of R848
leads to long-lasting immune unresponsiveness that is initiated
24 hours after injection. Because TLR7 tolerance may represent
a severe limitation for therapeutic use, we further investigated
this phenomenon at the cellular and molecular level.

plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs
To determine the cell type responsible for the observed
TLR7 tolerance, we treated freshly isolated bone marrow cells
with different concentrations of R848. Cells were restimulated

24 hours later with R848, and cytokine secretion was measured
upon secondary stimulation (Fig. 2A). Indeed, pretreatment of
bone marrow cells with as little as 0.01 mg/mL R848 entirely
blocked the induction of IFN-a by R848 (Fig. 2A). A similar
suppression was seen for the secretion of IL-12p70 and IL-6.
IL-12p40 secretion was inhibited only at higher concentrations of R848 prestimulation. Because the main producers of
IFN-a upon TLR7 stimulation are plasmacytoid DCs (17), we
investigated the effect of R848 pretreatment on plasmacytoid DCs. We observed a complete block in IFN-a secretion
in this cell type after prestimulation with 0.1 mg/mL R848
(Fig. 2B). Furthermore, R848 pretreatment inhibited IL12p70 and IL-6 production in plasmacytoid DCs. We also
examined the effect of sequential R848 application in myeloid DCs. As seen with plasmacytoid DCs, the production of
IL-12p70 and IL-6 was decreased in this population after
pretreatment with R848. Thus, we show for the first time
that TLR7 tolerance occurs in DCs of both the plasmacytoid
and myeloid subtypes and results in abolished secretion of
IFN-a and IL-12p70.

R848 induces cross-tolerance in plasmacytoid and

The TLR4 agonist LPS induces not only homotolerance,
defined as tolerance toward a second stimulation via the same
receptor, but also cross-tolerance toward subsequent stimulation via other TLRs (18, 19). To determine whether TLR7
stimulation induces cross-tolerance in DCs, bone marrow–
derived plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs were cultured for 24
hours in the presence of R848, washed, and incubated for
another 24 hours in fresh medium with the TLR ligands R848,

plasmacytoid DCs toward TLR9 stimulation with a complete
block of IFN-a and IL-12p70 secretion (Fig. 3A). Myeloid DCs
are tolerized toward TLR2/6, TLR4, and TLR9 with a complete
block of IL-12p70 and partial block of IL-6 and IL-12p40
(Fig. 3B). Thus, R848 induces cross-tolerance to several other
TLRs in plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs.

whether IL-10 production played a role in the tolerance observed following repeated stimulation with R848. Interestingly, in
sharp contrast to the results obtained for proinflammatory
cytokines, pretreatment with R848 led to increased levels of
IL-10 when cells were restimulated with the TLR agonists R848,
CpG, and, in the case of myeloid DCs, LPS (Fig. 4A). To assess
whether increased IL-10 levels were responsible for TLR7 tolerance, DCs from IL-10–deficient mice were stimulated twice with

adapter protein IRAK-1 in plasmacytoid DCs following R848
activation. In plasmacytoid DCs, IRAK-1 is essential for the
induction of IFN-a through TLR7 (7). IRAK-1 expression levels
were sharply decreased as early as 5 minutes after exposure to
R848 and remained low for at least 24 hours. A second
stimulation with R848 after 24 hours did not increase
IRAK-1 expression (Fig. 5A). To investigate IRAK-1 levels in
treated mice, IRAK-1 expression was analyzed in splenocytes
from mice injected once with R848. IRAK-1 was decreased in
treated animals 2 hours after R848 injection and was not
detectable 48 hours after injection (Fig. 5A). The rapid and
persistent decrease in IRAK-1 following R848 treatment may
thus represent an essential mechanism for TLR7 tolerance. The
increased production of IFN-a seen when mice were restimulated with R848 at an early time point after the first injection
(Fig. 1) may result from a priming effect of type I IFN (22).
Indeed, pDCs prestimulated with recombinant IFN-a show
enhanced secondary IFN-a secretion following R848 stimulation (Fig. 5B). Similarly, mice pretreated with recombinant
IFN-a show increased IFN-a responses to R848 4 hours after
prestimulation. This effect decreases at 24 hours and is lost 48
hours after prestimulation with IFN-a. No serum IFN-a was
observed 4 hours after prestimulation with recombinant IFN-a
alone (data not shown), showing that the measured serum

A fractionated R848 treatment regimen circumvents
TLR7 tolerance and translates into efficient antitumor
therapy
To prevent a rapid decline of cytokine levels (Supplementary Fig. S1), we designed a treatment protocol to take
advantage of the early hyperresponsiveness by repetitively
injecting R848 at very short intervals. The repeated treatment
consisted of 4 s.c. injections of R848 at 0, 4, 6, and 24 hours and
resulted in enhanced levels of IFN-a and IL-6 and longer-lived
cytokine responses (Fig. 6A). Indeed, with the repeated regimen, IL-12p70 was still detectable 8 hours and 26 hours after
the first injection, whereas it was barely detectable in mice 8
hours after a single application. Thus, 4 injections of R848
within 24 hours lead to enhanced and sustained cytokine titers
before the appearance of tolerance. In contrast to this protocol, 4 injections given at 24-hour intervals lead to a substantial suppression of cytokine secretion and to a state of
hyporesponsiveness toward repeated stimulation (data not
shown). In a recent clinical trial in patients with metastatic
melanoma, the synthetic TLR7 agonist 852A was administered
systemically 3 times a week with limited success (9). According to our data, such a scheduling may result in tachyphylaxis.
To circumvent tolerance, we applied a fractionated protocol in
cycles at 5-day intervals, so that the refractory state would be
resolved (see Fig. 1). To test the efficacy of this regimen, mice

ELISA. Data are shown relative to cells without prestimulation and are representative of 2 independent experiments. B, right, mice (n ¼ 3 to 5 per group)
were treated with one injection of 104 U recombinant IFN-a followed by restimulation with 20 mg R848 4 to 48 hours later. Two hours after R848 injection,

with established s.c. CT26 tumors were treated from day 7
with (i) one administration of 30 mg R848 every 3 days, (ii) 4
injections of 10 mg R848 per cycle according to the repeated
protocol every 5 days, or (iii) were left untreated. Thus, the
cumulative dose of R848 was lower in the fractionated regimen than in the single injection regimen. The fractionated
treatment protocol potently reduced the growth of established
tumors (Fig. 6B). In contrast, single injections given every third
(Fig. 6B) or every fifth day (not shown) had a limited success in
preventing tumor growth. Indeed, the fractionated protocol
was as efficient as a published DC vaccine combined with the
TLR9 agonist CpG (refs. 23, 24; Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus,
cycles of repeated R848 applications separated by 5-day
intervals may improve the therapeutic efficacy of TLR7 agonists by circumventing tolerance.

Discussion
Despite the strong immune activation induced by TLR7
ligands and their extensive success for the immunotherapy of
skin tumors when applied topically, their systemic use for the
treatment of cancer has not met expectations. One drawback

www.aacrjournals.org

for the use of TLR ligands is the immune suppression due to
the phenomenon of TLR tolerance, best characterized for
TLR4 stimulation by repeated administration of low-dose
LPS. Recently, in vivo tolerance was also described for
TLR7: Repeated applications of a synthetic TLR7 agonist, at
a low dose that did not result in measurable cytokine
responses, blocked the induction of the proinflammatory
cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 and limited the course of inflammation in autoimmune encephalomyelitis (14). Whether this
tachyphylaxis phenomenon can also be observed after in vivo
application of an immunoactive dose of a TLR7 agonist and
whether it affects cytokines essential for the anticancer efficacy of TLR7 agonists such as IL-12 and IFN-a is, however, to
date not known. We observed that a single injection of the
TLR7 agonist R848, after a short phase of hyperresponsiveness,
completely blocked the induction of IFN-a by a subsequent
stimulation and strongly reduced production of the bioactive
IL-12p70 for up to 5 days.
To elucidate the cellular basis for the observed block in
IFN-a and IL-12p70, we investigated TLR7 tolerance in cell
culture by using primary bone marrow cells and bone
marrow–derived DCs. DCs in particular play an essential role

for the initiation and development of antitumor immunity (25)
and are one of the main producers of the antitumor cytokines
IFN-a and IL-12p70. Myeloid DCs are susceptible to tolerance
via the receptors TLR2 and TLR4 (12, 26), but tolerance to
TLR7 in myeloid DCs has to our knowledge not been previously described. Here we clearly show tolerance in primary
bone marrow cells and in myeloid DCs following TLR7 activation, characterized by a block in IL-12p70 and IL-6 production.
In sharp contrast to the block in proinflammatory cytokines,
we observed increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 in tolerant cells subsequent to TLR restimulation, as seen previously for TLR4 stimulation of myeloid DCs
(26). However, we show using IL-10–deficient mice that this
cytokine is not essential for tolerance in myeloid DCs. Interestingly, the p40 subunit of IL-12 was not affected by tolerance
in vivo. The p40 subunit is synthesized in excess over p35, the

5130

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

other subunit of the IL-12 heterodimer, which is rate limiting
for the production of bioactive IL-12 (27). Thus, the p40
protein may not be as sensitive toward TLR tolerance as the
p35 subunit. In vitro, p40 was less suppressed and required
higher doses of R848 for tolerance induction than the other
cytokines in our study. Prostaglandin E2–conditioned DCs
have a cytokine profile similar to R848-prestimulated DCs:
They produce enhanced levels of IL-10, decreased IL-12p70,
and unchanged amounts of IL-12p40 (28, 29). However, we
observed no significant change in R848-induced tolerance in
the presence of COX-1/2 inhibitors, suggesting that prostaglandins are not determinant for tolerance induction (Supplementary Fig. S3). Indeed, tolerance was not mediated by a
soluble factor, as supernatant from R848-treated cells did
not transfer tolerance (data not shown). Taken together,
these results suggest that tolerance is not mediated by

Cancer Research

R848 Tolerance in Cancer Immunotherapy

soluble factors such as anti-inflammatory cytokines or prostaglandins, but is cell-intrinsic.
Several molecular mechanisms have been described for
TLR4 tolerance, such as a decreased accumulation of NF-kB
(13), a reduced activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase p38 (26), or increased expression and activation of the
regulator molecule IRAK-M (14). In addition, decreased signaling through the adapter molecule IRAK-1 has been shown
to mediate TLR7 tolerance in murine macrophages (15, 19).
We found that IRAK-1 was depleted within minutes of R848
stimulation in plasmacytoid DCs and was maintained at low
levels for at least 24 hours. Because IRAK-1 is essential for the
induction of IFN-a through TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation in
plasmacytoid DCs (7), this finding is sufficient to explain the
block in IFN-a secretion. The downregulation of IRAK-1 was
confirmed in vivo, as this protein was not detectable in the
spleen 48 hours after R848 injection. Residual levels of IRAK-1
were, however, observed in the spleen 2 hours after injection.
These low levels of IRAK-1 may be sufficient, in the presence of
an enhancing factor, to mediate the increased IFN-a response
seen at early time points after TLR7 stimulation. Type I IFN,
which is increased in serum for up to 6 hours after TLR7
stimulation, may represent such an amplification factor of
IFN-a (22). IRAK-1 is not involved in TLR-dependent proinflammatory cytokine release by plasmacytoid DCs (7),
suggesting that IRAK-1 degradation is not responsible for
the hyporesponsiveness affecting IL-6 and IL-12. Further
studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms involved
in decreased secretion of these cytokines in this cell type.
In a recent clinical study on TLR tolerance, subjects were
injected with the TLR4 agonist LPS (30). In vitro restimulation
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these subjects with
TLR ligands showed both homo- and heterotolerance, including a decreased ability to secrete type I IFNs after TLR7
stimulation. This suggests that TLR7 tolerance may occur in
humans and may affect IFN-a secretion by plasmacytoid DCs.
Both the cytokines IFN-a and IL-12 are believed to play central
roles in the immunologic control of cancer (31, 32). The short
duration of cytokine secretion following systemic administration of small molecule TLR7/8 agonists, together with the longlasting immune tolerance induced, may therefore pose severe
limitations to the use of these compounds for the immunotherapy of cancer. Taking advantage of the hyperresponsiveness in
the early phase following administration, we designed a protocol relying on cycles of repeated R848 treatment within 24
hours interspaced by 5 days to circumvent tachyphylaxis. This
fractionated regimen was superior to other treatment options,
including R848 application protocols used previously in clinical
studies. Indeed, protocols consisting of single injections at 2- to
4-day intervals may result in short-lived cytokine titers followed
by induction of tolerance that decreases treatment efficacy.
The difference in therapeutic efficacy observed between
topical and systemic treatment with TLR7 agonists may result
from a variety of mechanisms. Local effects not directly related
to cytokine production by DCs may largely contribute to the
efficacy of topical TLR7 agonists. Imiquimod-activated DCs
can directly kill tumor cells via perforin, Granzyme B, and
TRAIL-dependent mechanisms (33), and imiquimod itself may

www.aacrjournals.org

have a direct proapoptotic effect on tumor cells (34, 35). Skin
lesions treated topically with imiquimod show infiltrates of
cytotoxic T cells and DCs (33, 36), suggesting that topical
treatment leads to the local production of chemotactic factors
for effector cells. Thus, systemic and topical administration
may differ substantially in their modes of action. It is probable
that topical application of TLR7 agonists does not induce
tolerance either systemically or locally. We have observed that
R848 at concentrations of 0.5 ng/mL and below does not
induce tolerance in bone marrow cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4), suggesting that the very low serum concentrations
observed after topical application (37, 38) do not induce
systemic tolerance. In TLR7-treated skin, persistent upregulation of IFN-a and IFN-inducible genes was shown (39, 40),
suggesting that topical treatment with TLR7 agonists does not
result in local tolerance either. It is possible that untolerized
circulating DCs, which infiltrate the treated skin areas de novo
(39), contribute to cytokine production in the skin (39, 40).
Whether the difference in tolerance between topical and
systemic treatment plays a role in the observed difference
in treatment efficacy is, however, unclear.
Mechanistically, TLR7 ligands exert their antitumoral effect
on several cell types, including DCs and T cells (41, 42). In
addition, Butchar and colleagues showed that TLR7 ligands
improve the outcome of treatment with monoclonal antibodies by increasing Fc-g receptor expression and thus enhancing antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (43). We have
shown earlier that application of TLR7-activating RNA oligonucleotides can prevent growth of NK cell–sensitive tumors by
activation of NK cells via TLR7-expressing DCs (44). Furthermore, small molecule TLR7 agonists and immunostimulatory
RNA block the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (45).
In conclusion, according to this study, a key feature of therapy
with TLR7 agonists will be to provide sustained and longlasting stimulation rather than short-lived immune activation
by immune modifying agents. Given that TLR tolerance is a
general phenomenon, our findings have implications for all
immunotherapeutic interventions relying on systemic application of TLR agonists as immune response modifiers.
