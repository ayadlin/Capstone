ABSTRACT
Mutations of mitochondrial (mt)DNA cause a variety of human diseases and are
implicated in premature aging syndromes. Here we investigated a single nucleotide
exchange (leucine to methionine) at position nt4738 in the mitochondrial NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2 (Nd2) gene of the respiratory chain. Primary fibroblasts
derived from the conplastic mouse strain C57BL/6J-mtALR/LTJ with mutant enzyme,
possessed high enzyme activity and ATP production and low ROS production.
Furthermore, Nd2-mutant fibroblasts expressed lower senescence markers.
Transcriptome analysis revealed that the members of the p38MAPK pathway were
significantly downregulated in Nd2-mutant mice. In agreement, inhibition of p38MAPK
with SB203580 enhanced proliferation and reduced cytokine secretion in fibroblasts.
In Nd2-mutant mouse skin, the amount of Ki67-positive cells was significantly
higher than in control skin. The higher amount of Ki67-positive cells and the thicker
epidermis in Nd2-mutant mice strongly supported the in vitro data. In conclusion,
Nd2 is a mitochondrial gene, involved in age-related signaling pathways.

(T4681C) was found in patients with Leigh Syndrome,
a neurodegenerative disease characterized by bilateral
symmetric lesions in basal ganglia and subcortical
brain regions [3]. It is postulated that ND2 is involved
in proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial
membrane, thereby contributing to the pH regulation of
the cell. The hydrophobic subunit of complex I is highly
conserved throughout evolution from bacteria to mice to
man, arguing for a central physiological role [4]. Specific
mitochondrial point mutations cause the development of
different diseases and are involved in the processes of
aging. For example, Alzheimer’s disease is associated
with dysfunction in the mitochondrial electron transport
enzyme cytochrome c oxidase [5; 6]. Genetic alterations in
mitochondrial DNA may cause a decline in mitochondrial

INTRODUCTION
NADH dehydrogenase is the first enzyme complex
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I) and
oxidizes NADH to liberate electrons to support the
translocation of protons across the inner membrane to
create a proton gradient [1]. The mammalian complex I
has a molecular size of 1 MDa and contains 45 subunits,
7 of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and
38 by nuclear DNA [2]. The seven mitochondrialencoded subunits (ND1–6 und ND4L) play a significant
role in diverse pathological processes. The NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 2 enzyme is encoded by the ND2
gene and has a size of 39 kDa. The function of ND2
is not fully understood. A mutation in the ND2 gene

oxidative phosphorylation, increased mitochondrial
production of reactive oxygen species and an enhanced
amount of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids
[5]. A direct link between mtDNA and mammalian
aging was shown in mice with a proofreading-deficient-,
catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ
(PolgA). In these mice, the accumulation of mtDNA
mutations was linked to an impaired respiratory chain
function and increased cellular apoptosis. The mutated
mice had a shorter life span and developed an age-related
phenotype with hair loss, osteoporosis and kyphosis [7].
Cellular senescence is a contributor to organismal
aging. Senescent cells have been detected in vivo in
different tissues in mice and humans [8]. Senescence can
be triggered by various extrinsic and intrinsic factors,
and was first observed in cell culture [9]. In superoxide
dismutase 2 (SOD2)-deficient mice was shown that natural
aging is linked by decreased mitochondrial activity in
complex II and increased cellular senescence in mouse
skin. Accompanied by the idea that these events are linked,
constitutive SOD2-deficency resulted in mitochondrial
dysfunction and cellular senescence in the epidermis of
the skin [10]. For in vitro or in vivo characterization of
senescent cells show reduced proliferation, enhanced
β-galactosidase activity, expression of senescentassociated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) or senescenceassociated DNA damage foci (SDF), activation of
different stress pathways such as p53 or p38MAPK,
and development of a senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) [11].
Comparing Japanese centenarians with younger
control individuals shows an association of the ND2
Leu273Met polymorphism (A5178T) with longevity
[12; 13]. Additionally, individuals with this polymorphism
provide resistance against ROS-mediated diseases
like myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and high
blood pressure [4; 14]. Mice with the corresponding
polymorphism of a leucine to methionine transition at
position nt4738 (known as the alloxan-resistant (ALR)
mouse strain) showed resistance to the development
of spontaneous type-I diabetes and had reduced ROS
production compared with NOD (non-obese diabetic)
mice [14].
The present study demonstrates that an Nd2
mutation at position nt4738 in the conplastic mouse strain
C57BL/6J-mtALR/LtJ suppresses ROS-induced-senescence
in primary skin fibroblasts. Microarray analysis suggests
that downregulation of the p38MAPK pathway is a major
contributor to reduced senescence induction. Inhibition
of p38MAPK (with inhibitor SB203580) indeed led to a
stronger reversion of the expression of senescence markers
in the Nd2-mutant strain compared with control mice. Taken
together, our data show that the Nd2 mutation is protective
for fibroblasts against ROS-induced cellular senescence,
which may also have an impact on organismal aging.

Skin fibroblasts of Nd2-mutant mice show
significantly reduced ROS levels
The mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) is physiological but has also been
described in ROS-induced aging and senescence. In
the present study, the question was addressed whether
mitochondrial mutations in respiratory chain genes
influence the cellular senescence of skin fibroblasts
and skin aging. For this purpose, four conplastic mouse
strains were used with identical nuclear DNA but with
different mutations in the mitochondrial genome and
uncoupling protein 2-knockout strain [15]. C57BL/
6J-mtAKR/J mice were used as reference strain; these differ
only in the respective position of the mitochondrial
genome from the experimental strains (Table S1). First,
the basal ROS production of primary skin fibroblasts
of aged mice (12-month-old) of different conplastic
strains and uncoupling protein 2-knockout strain was
tested. The fibroblasts of strains C57BL/6J-UCP2–/–,
C57BL/6J-mtFVB/NJ and C57BL/6J-mt129S1/SvlmJ showed
no significant difference in basal ROS production as
compared with the control strain (Figure 1). However,
the C57BL/6J-mtALR/LtJ strain with the mutation in
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (Nd2; position nt4738)
showed significantly reduced basal ROS levels. Based
on this data, the Nd2-mutant mouse strain (C57BL/
6J-mtALR/LtJ) was chosen to analyze the impact of a specific
point mutation on fibroblast senescence and skin aging.

Skin fibroblasts of Nd2-mutant mice show
reduced expression of cellular senescence
markers
Next the enzymatic activity of complex I in
Nd2-mutant and control primary skin fibroblasts was
investigated. Complex I is of central importance for
ATP production, and the Nd2 mutation could thus result
in either enhanced or reduced enzyme activity and
energy production. Complex I activity was determined
by measurement of the oxidation of NADH to NAD+
from isolated mitochondria of Nd2-mutant and control
fibroblasts. Fibroblast mitochondria of the Nd2-mutant
strain showed a 2.6-fold higher complex I activity as
compared with control mitochondria (Figure 2A). Thus,
the Nd2-mutant mice may have an enhanced Nd2 baseline
activity. We also tested if the enzyme activity correlated
with protein expression of complex I in control and Nd2mutant mice. The basal and the stress-induced protein
expression of Nd2 did not differ in fibroblasts between
both strains (Figure S1), however.
To further characterize the mitochondrial function
of skin fibroblasts, ATP production was measured in

fibroblasts of young (3-month-old) and aged (12-monthold) mice. Nd2-mutant skin fibroblasts produced
significantly higher amounts ATP at both time points
than control fibroblasts (Figure 2B). As shown above, the
ROS levels in Nd2-mutant fibroblasts were significantly
lower than in control fibroblasts, as determined by the
DCFH-DA method (Figure 1, Figure 2C). These findings
suggest that higher complex I enzyme activity leads to
higher ATP production and decreased ROS production,
and we hypothesize that the induction of senescence in
skin fibroblasts of Nd2-mutant mice may thus be reduced
during the aging process.
Therefore, primary skin fibroblasts isolated from
3- and 12-month-old Nd2-mutant mice and control mice
were analyzed for the expression of markers of cellular
senescence. At a cellular level, senescence in primary
fibroblasts might be detrimental for skin function in
general. In a first series of experiments, the impact of the
Nd2 mutation on cellular proliferation of primary skin
fibroblasts in both strains was analyzed. For this purpose,
BrdU incorporation assays were performed. Nd2-mutant
fibroblasts showed a more than 50% higher proliferation
rate than control fibroblasts in both 3- and in 12-month-old
mice (Figure 3A).
In subsequent analyses, we examined the senescenceassociated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, a common
marker of cellular senescence, in fibroblasts isolated from
12-month-old mice of both strains. SA-β-gal activity in
skin fibroblasts of the Nd2-mutant strain was significantly
lower than that of control fibroblasts (Figure  3B). This
suggests that Nd2-mutant mouse fibroblasts have a better
resistance to induction of cellular senescence as compared
with fibroblasts of the control strain.
A further characteristic feature of senescent
cells is the development of a senescence-associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells increase
the secretion of various cytokines, chemokines and
matrix metalloproteinases, which alter the local tissue
environment [16]. Here we measured a prominent
component of the SASP, IL-6. To induce a SASP by
genotoxic stress, cells were exposed to doxorubicin, and
cytokine secretion was measured at different time points.
Doxorubicin is a well-known antitumor anthracycline
antibiotic, which induces genotoxic and oxidative stress
and cellular senescence in different cell types [17; 18].
After treatment of fibroblasts with low dose (250 nM)
doxorubicin, an increase in IL-6 secretion was observed in
both mouse strains over 8 days. Interestingly, Nd2-mutant
fibroblasts showed a significantly lower IL-6 secretion
compared with control fibroblasts (Figure 3C).
Cellular senescence is further characterized by
an increased expression of a number of DNA damageassociated proteins and followed by activation of the
p53 pathway. Thus, the activation and expression of
γH2A.X and p-p53 protein was examined by immunoblot
analysis (Figure 3D). Whole cell lysates were prepared
from fibroblasts at different time points after doxorubicin
treatment until cells developed a senescent phenotype
(0  – 8 days). First, the expression of γH2A.X as a
typical marker of DNA damage and cellular senescence
was analyzed [19]. Both strains showed activation and
phosphorylation at serine 139 of H2A.X, indicated
as γH2A.X. γH2A.X expression increased 2 h after
doxorubicin treatment in fibroblasts of Nd2-mutant
and control mice. The activation of γH2A.X remained
stable until 24 h in Nd2-mutant fibroblasts, but in control
fibroblasts until 4 d. Interestingly, doxorubicin-induced
DNA damage led to a similar phosphorylation kinetic of
p53 in Nd2-mutant and control fibroblasts. In both strains,
p53 showed increased phosphorylation until 24 h. At 4d,

the p-p53 expression started to decrease in both strains.
The p-p53 reaction pattern looked similar in both strains;
however in Nd2 mutant strain fibroblasts overall p-p53
expression was weaker.
Next, p38MAPK expression and phosphorylation
was tested (Figure 4A). Diverse senescence stimuli
activate this kinase, which in turn regulates the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype by increasing
NF-κB activity independent of other senescence pathways
[16]. After doxorubicin treatment, total p38MAPK
(p38α, β, γ) expression increased until 4 d in mutant
mouse fibroblasts. In control fibroblasts, total p38MAPK
expression was constantly expressed. p38MAPK is
activated by phosphorylation at threonine 180 and tyrosine
182. In Nd2-mutant fibroblasts, p38MAPK was transiently
phosphorylated at 2 h and phosphorylation decreased
thereafter. In contrast, in control fibroblasts, the activation
of p38MAPK phosphorylation showed constantly high
levels until 24 h, which decreased after 4 d.
Taken together, this data are indicative of an
important role for Nd2 as an upstream inducer of cellular
senescence and a SASP. The different activation of the
p38MAPK pathway in fibroblasts of both mouse strains
suggests that p38MAPK signaling is involved in this
process. To further address this issue a transcriptome
analysis was performed.

enriched genes (involved in “MAPK signaling pathways”
and “Pathways in cancer”) interact with p38MAPK. This
suggested that the Nd2-induced pro-senescence effects
in mouse skin fibroblasts are at least in part mediated by
p38MAPK signaling. As mentioned, both Nd2-mutant and
control cells showed comparable levels of p38α mRNA
(Figure S2).
In the transcriptome analysis, we found that one
half of the downregulated genes of enriched pathways
(“MAPK signaling pathways” and “Pathways in cancer”)
in Nd2-mutant fibroblast interact with the p38MAPK
signaling pathway. The p38MAPK pathway is described
as a crucial SASP regulatory pathway in the process of
cellular senescence, which is activated by phosphorylation
in response to acute cellular stress [16]. To test whether
the reduced senescence in Nd2-mutant mice might involve
p38MAPK, we inhibited p38MAPK with the chemical
inhibitor SB203580 (SB). This potent inhibitor acts via
prevention of ATP binding to the p38MAPK ATP binding
pocket but leaves p38 phosphorylation unaffected [16].
For this purpose, fibroblasts from the Nd2-mutant
and control strain were treated with SB203580. First, to
identify the optimal treatment procedure, SA-β-gal assays
were performed with skin fibroblasts from C57BL/6J
mice treated with different concentrations of SB203580
(Figure S3). A concentration of 10 μM showed an
effective reduction of the amount of SA-β-gal-positive
cells by 50% after 4 days of continuous treatment. Thus,
this concentration was used for further experiments.
Next, fibroblasts were treated with doxorubicin to induce
senescence and cellular proliferation was measured after
4 d. Doxorubicin treatment led to reduction of proliferation
by 60% in fibroblasts of both strains. In both strains the
proliferation measured with BrdU incorporation increased
significantly by adding SB203580 to the doxorubicin
treatment. Interestingly, the increase in proliferation in
Nd2-mutant mouse fibroblasts is significantly higher as
compared with control fibroblasts (Figure 5A).
To investigate the role of p38MAPK inhibition
on mitochondrial function, ATP levels in fibroblasts of
both mouse strains were analyzed (Figure 5B). We did
not observe changes on ATP production after treatment
with doxorubicin and SB203580 in skin fibroblasts of
mutant and control fibroblasts compared with untreated
control. This suggests that inhibition of p38MAPK has
no influence of the production of ATP by the respiratory
chain.
IL-6 is a major cytokine of the SASP. Cytokine
secretion of fibroblasts was measured by ELISA
(Figure  5C). To determine whether Nd2 has an impact
on the induction of the SASP, we treated skin fibroblasts
from Nd2-mutant and control mice with doxorubicin and
SB203580. Under doxorubicin treatment alone, secretion
of IL-6 increased in both strains as compared with
untreated control. Interestingly, the additional inhibition

Nd2 mediates its effects via p38MAPK signaling
To identify genes and pathways involved in
mediating the anti-senescence effects of mutant Nd2, a
transcriptome analysis of Nd2-mutant (n = 4) and control
skin fibroblasts (n = 4) from 12-month-old mice was
performed. This screen identified 766 genes that were
significantly differentially expressed (upregulated or
downregulated) between both mouse strains (Table S2).
Further analysis of the downregulated genes in Nd2mutant fibroblasts with DAVID Bioinformatics Resources
6.7 program [http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/] revealed
an enrichment of pathways mainly involved in cancer
(fold enrichment 2.34) and MAPK signaling (fold
enrichment 2.24) (Figure 4B). Next, we investigated
whether the downregulated genes that are involved
in “pathways in cancer” and the “MAPK signaling
pathway” showed interactions with established mediators
of senescence like p38MAPK, which showed in our
immunoblot analysis specific differences in expression
and activation (Figure 4A). For this purpose, the genes of
the top pathways were analyzed with the bioinformatics
tool STRING 9.1 (Search Tool for the Retrieval of
Interacting Genes and Proteins; [20]). The main members
of p38MAPK pathway (MAPK14 (p38α) MAPK11
(p38β) and MAPK12 (p38γ), although not differentially
expressed, was included in this analysis (Figure 4C).
Interestingly, the analysis revealed that 50% of the top

transversion at position nt5178 (C5178A) resulting in a
leucine to methionine substitution has been associated
with the reduction of the incidence of diseases such as
atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and type 1 diabetes
in Japanese patients [14].
By using conplastic mouse strains, we established
new mouse models to analyze the influence of specific
mitochondrial gene variations in mitochondrial respiratory
chain complexes on cellular senescence and skin aging.
We used isolated skin fibroblasts from mouse strain
C57BL/6J-mtALR/LtJ (Nd2-mutant) and from C57BL/
6J-mtAKR/J as control in all experiments. The two strains
only differ in one mutation. The mutant strain carries the
mutation in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 at position
nt4738. This mutation leads to an adenine to cytosine
exchange. We first analyzed several parameters of basal
mitochondrial function and identified a difference in
complex I activity, ATP- and ROS production between the
strains. Fibroblasts from the Nd2-mutant strain showed a
significantly higher mitochondrial complex I activity. This
higher activity was associated with significantly enhanced
ATP production and reduced ROS production with similar
Nd2 protein expression levels. According to the gradual
ROS response hypothesis [26], while ROS at lower levels
is considered beneficial as a mediator of stress response
and repair, ROS at higher levels are involved in organismal
aging as oxidative damage in cells has been shown to
limit the life span of organisms [27]. ROS have also been
shown to enhance cellular senescence and organismal
aging [28]. In line with our findings, several studies in
different organisms have shown a negative relationship
between mitochondrial ROS production and lifespan. For
example, Lambert et al. isolated heart mitochondria from
mouse, rat, white-footed mouse, naked mole-rat, and a
series of other animal species and showed that maximum
life span was negatively correlated with hydrogen
peroxide production during reverse electron transport in
mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I [28]. Although,
complex I and complex III are considered to be two major
sources of ROS production in mitochondria, there is
evidence that complex I accounts for majority of the ROS
generated in intact mammalian mitochondria [29; 30].
Moreover, it has been postulated that decreased activity of
complex I in brain mitochondria from Parkinson’s patient
results directly from oxidative damage of its subunits [31].
In another study, comparing the type 1 diabetes-prone
non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain with the alloxanresistant (ALR) mouse strain, the NADH dehydrogenase
2 gene was found to be involved in conferring resistance
to diabetes and exert an influence on ROS generation.
Mitochondria from ALRmtNOD mice carry the cytosinecontaining allele mt-Nd2c, which resulted in increased
ROS production. Our findings agree with a damaging
role of ROS, suggesting that its level is sufficiently high
to cause (oxidative) damage in our experimental system.

of p38MAPK by SB203580 treatment led to a reduction of
IL-6, which was even significantly stronger in Nd2-mutant
fibroblasts as compared with control fibroblasts.
Taken together, these results provide strong evidence
that p38MAPK is a downstream effector of Nd2-induced
cellular senescence. The inhibition of p38MAPK in Nd2mutant cells, but not in control cells rescues the cells
from senescence features such as reduced proliferation,
reduced viability and enhanced IL-6 secretion induced by
genotoxic stress-inducing agent doxorubicin.

Epidermal thickness of Nd2-mutant mice
Next, we wondered whether the reduced cellular
senescence effects of Nd2-mutant fibroblasts translate into
reduced aging of the skin in vivo. The common in vitro
marker SA-β-galactosidase showed contradictory results
[21; 22] in vivo. For this reason, other senescence markers
were preferred like epidermal thickness and the number
of Ki67-positive cells in skin of mutated and control
mice. Indeed, 12-month-old Nd2-mutant mice showed
a thicker epidermis relative to control mice, whose skin
was more atrophic (Figure 6A and 6B). This phenomenon
is due to a higher number of epidermal keratinocyte layers
consistent with the higher proliferation rate of epidermal
keratinoyctes in these mice.
Finally, the skin of 12-month-old Nd2-mutant and
control mice was stained for the proliferation marker Ki67
(Figure 6C and 6D). The nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI. The Ki67-positive cells were determined by ratio
of Ki67-positive/Ki67-negative cells in the epidermis and
dermis excluding hair follicles. In Nd2-mutant mouse skin,
the amount of Ki67-positive cells was significantly higher
than in control skin. The higher amount of Ki67-positive
cells and the thicker epidermis in Nd2-mutant mice is
strongly supported the in vitro data.

Discussion
Mitochondrial dysfunction, and in particular
impairment of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) system, has been shown to result in various
degenerative diseases and cancers [23; 24]. Deficits of
the respiratory chain complexes (particularly complexes
I, II, IV or V) are responsible for the neurodegenerative
disorder Leigh syndrome or Leigh-like syndrome. Patients
with Leigh syndrome are carrying specific point mutations
in the mitochondrially encoded subunits 1–6 of NADH
dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase [25].
Mutations in complex I to V were also found in different
human cancers such as prostate, pancreas, colon, and
breast cancer [23]. However, genetic alterations in these
genes could also confer resistance to other diseases.
For example, a mutation in the mitochondrial gene
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, a cytosine to adenine

Accordingly, in our case the mitochondria with the
adenine containing allele (mt-Nda) that results in a leucine
to methionine transition yield lower ROS levels, which is
beneficial, in line with [4; 14].
To determine whether higher complex I activity
and reduced ROS levels in the Nd2-mutant strain have
any influence on cellular survival and senescence; we
analyzed fibroblast proliferation and expression of
senescence markers like SA-β-gal. Indeed, Nd2-mutant
skin fibroblasts showed significantly increased ability
to resist cellular senescence characterized by reduced
SA-β-gal activity, showed enhanced proliferation and
reduced secretion of senescence-associated cytokine. We
hypothesize that the reduced senescence phenomena in
Nd2-mutant cells are a result of lower ROS production as
a consequence of high complex I activity.
p38MAPK is described as an important promoter
of cellular senescence mediated by NF-κB signaling
[16]. However, the interplay between p38MAPK and
complexes of the OXPHOS system is largely unknown.
Interestingly, our transcriptome analysis comparing Nd2mutant and control mice showed a reduced expression
of different genes in Nd2-mutant mice, a majority of
which were found to interact with p38MAPK. On the
protein level, the activation/expression of p38MAPK
after doxorubicin treatment was found to be transient
in Nd2-mutant mouse at 2 h but stable until 24 h in
control fibroblasts. This suggested that Nd2-induced
cellular senescence is at least in part mediated through
p38MAPK.
Recent studies have demonstrated that ROS can
induce or mediate the activation of p38MAPK [32]. We
hypothesized that low intracellular ROS levels in Nd2mutant mouse fibroblasts lead to a low activation of the
p38MAPK pathway with the consequence of reduced
IL-6. To further address this, we used the p38MAPK
inhibitor SB203580 to investigate the impact of an
activated p38MAPK pathway on IL-6. Pharmacological
inhibition of p38MAPK activation with SB203580 could
prevent cells from entering the process of senescence
[33; 16]. p38MAPK inhibition had stronger effects
on senescence-associated features such as reduced
proliferation, and IL-6 secretion induced by the DNA
damaging agent doxorubicin in Nd2-mutant mouse
fibroblasts, than in control fibroblasts. These results
supported our findings that the Nd2-mutation in fibroblasts
leads to an attenuated activation the p38MAPK pathway,
finally resulting in reduced senescence. In line with our
findings, p38MAPK inhibition by SB203580 was found to
mitigate components of SASP in an earlier study [16]. In
this study, radiation-induced senescent HCA2 fibroblasts
treated with SB203580 showed reduced secretion of
IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF. The study also showed that
p38MAPK inhibition repressed the pro-invasive effects of
senescent cells [16].

In an earlier study, mtDNA from 37 Japanese
centenarians and 43 controls was analysed [12]. Mutations
at position nt5178 in the ND2 gene were more frequently
observed in centenarians than in controls [12]. These
findings suggested that this mutation in ND2 is related to
longevity.
The accumulation of cellular and oxidative damage
by ROS is not the only mechanism which may explain
mechanism underlying senescence and limitation of life
span. There is strong evidence that the nutrient-sensing
molecular mTOR (target of rapamycin) pathway influences
ROS generation and may play a central role in aging
and nutritional control of life span [34]. Recent studies
showed that the inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin
extends life span in mice and prevents age-related diseases
[35]. In flies and yeast, inhibition of mTOR may lead to
increased antioxidant defenses [36]. There are different
links between ROS and mTOR pathway. On the one
hand, ROS can activate mTOR and on the other hand
TOR can increase or decrease the ROS production [34].
In studies with human cells hydrogen peroxide activated
the PI3-K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase)/mTOR/S6K
(ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1) pathway [37; 38].
It was further shown that ROS production was decreased
in primary rat hepatocytes after mTOR inhibition with
rapamycin [39]. Taken together, p38MAPK and PI3/AKT/
mTOR pathway appear to be strongly involved in cellular
senescence.
In conclusion, our study comprehensively
demonstrates that a mutation in the ND2 gene leads
to reduced activation of p38MAPK pathway, likely
mediated by lower ROS levels. This interplay of the
ND2 mutation, reduced ROS production and p38MAPK
activation could be protective against senescence and
other pathological conditions, which finally result in a
prolonged lifespan of skin fibroblasts and, maybe, even
the whole organism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Conplastic mice were generated by crossing
females from the mitochondrial donor strain to males
with a C57BL/6J background [15]. In each generation,
the female offspring were backcrossed to males. After
10 backcrosses, the offsprings were regarded as conplastic
strains with the nuclear genome of the recipient strain and
the mitochondrial genome from the donor strain. Animals
were housed at the animal facility at the University of
Lübeck. For this study, we used C57BL/6J-UCP2–/–,
C57BL/6J-mtFVB/NJ, C57BL/6J-mt129S1/SvlmJ C57BL7/
6J-mtALR/LtJ as Nd2-mutant strain and C57BL/6J-mtAKR/J as
controls.

Cell culture

Elisa

Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from mutant
and control mice using a standard dissociation protocol
adapted to the Liberase DL Research Grade (low dispase)
protocol of Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Skin
biopsies were cut into small pieces and added to Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing Liberase
DL Research grade with a final concentration of 1.3 U/mL
and were incubated for 2 hours. Isolated fibroblasts were
cultured for 5 days in DMEM, supplemented with 10%
FCS (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany), Penicilin/
Streptavidin, Mycokill (PAA Laboratories, Pasching,
Austria) in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Before experiments, cells
were cultured for 2 days in Mycokill-free medium. For all
experiments, cells from passage 1 were used.

IL-6 (ebioscience GmbH, Frankfurt/Main,
Germany) and KC (mouse homologue of IL-8)
(PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) concentrations
were measured by ELISA following manufacturer’s
instructions. Supernatants were assayed as triplicates
and values were calculated to standard values made from
known concentration of IL-6 or KC (IL-8). Untreated
values were subtracted from doxorubicin-treated values to
calculate the secretion of the indicated cytokine.

Western blot
Immunoblots were performed as described in
[40]. The following primary antibodies were used:
anti γ-H2A.X (phospho-histone H2A.X, sc-101696,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany),
anti-p38MAPK (#9212), anti-phospho-p38 (3D7)
(#9215), anti-phospho-p53 (#9284), all obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology. For loading control, antiribosomal protein L26 (Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg,
Germany) was used. The following secondary
antibodies were used: IRDye 680LT goat anti rabbit IgG
(926–68021) and IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG
(926–32210) (LI-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg,
Germany). Signals were measured with LI-COR
Odyssey® scanner and quantified with LI-COR Odyssey®
software 3.0 (LI-COR Biosciences).

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay
Cells were fixed and stained for SA-β-gal using
Senescence β-galactosidase Staining Kit from Cell
Signaling (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The ratio of the
number of positive blue cells and the total number of cells
was used to determine the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive
(senescent) cells.

Determination of ROS
Intracellular ROS levels were determined with 2′,
7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA;
Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany). Fibroblasts were
incubated for 30 min with 50 μM DCFH-DA after
which the cells were washed with PBS. Oxidized DCF
was measured at excitation wavelength of 488 nm and
emission wavelength at 525 nm. Data were normalized
to internal control (8- to 12-weeks-old male C57BL/6J
mouse fibroblasts).

Histopathology
Skin samples were cut into sections of 8 μM
thicknesses and stored at −80°C. Sections were fixed in
ice-cold acetone and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Epidermal thickness was measured by using BZ II
analyzer software (Keyence, Osaka, Japan).

Determination of ATP

Immunofluorescence staining

ATP determination was performed using the
CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were
calculated based on the standard values generated
from known concentrations of ATP dissolved in dH2O
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany).

Skin biopsies were cut into 8 μM sections and
stored at −80°C. Frozen sections were fixed and
incubated with primary antibodies 2 h in PBS/0.1%
Tween 20/0.3% BSA. Primary antibody from Bethyl
Laboratories, Inc. (Ki-67, 1:400; Montgomery,
Texas, USA) was used. Cell nuclei were stained
with  4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images
were acquired with a BZ-9000E microscope camera
and quantitated using ImageJ with the graylevel
watershed  algorithm (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/
watershed/).

Cell proliferation assay
For measurement of cell proliferation, a 5-bromo2′-deoxy-uridine cell proliferation ELISA was used
according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were labeled
with 10 μM BrdU labeling reagent for 2 hours. Data were
normalized  to internal control (C57BL/6J primary skin
fibroblasts).

cultured cells. According to the manufacturer’s instructions
(BioVision Inc, Milpitas, California, USA) 2  ×  107 cells
were used for isolation and protein concentrations were
determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bonn, Germany).

Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
and scanned on the Illumina HiScan instrument according
to manufacturer’s specifications. Raw data of 25, 600
probes was extracted and quantile normalized by Illumina
GenomeStudio®. Expression values were background
subtracted if necessary. We considered probes as present
for a detection p-value < 0.01. Thereafter, we used
Student’s t-tests to identify differentially expressed genes.
The results were corrected for multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes were considered
significantly differently expressed if p < 0.05.
The data was processed and analysed using the
Bioconductor packages lumi and limma [41; 42] in
the statistical programming environment R. Finally,
differentially expressed genes where subjected to
a functional enrichment analysis using the DAVID
Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 program (http://david.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov/). We used the default parameters to identify
enrichment of candidate gene in KEGG pathways.
Geo accession number: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63551.

Complex I activity assay
Complex I activity was determined by measuring the
oxidation of NADH to NAD+ at 340 nm. The assay medium
contained K2HPO4 (25 mM; pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25%
BSA, 3.7 μM antimycin and 2 mM KCN. A base line was
established after addition of 5.7 mM NADH and isolated
mitochondria of skin fibroblasts (31  μg). The reaction
was started by the addition of 2.8 mM CoQ1. The rate of
oxidation of NADH was recorded for 5 min. Rotenone
(0.36 mM), an inhibitor of complex I was added to determine
the rotenone insensitive activity. Complex I activity was
calculated by subtraction of the reaction rates in the presence
and absence of rotenone.

Quantitative real time PCR

Statistical analysis

Total RNA from cells was extracted using the
RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA
was transcribed with the High capacity cDNA-RT-Kit
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. For determination of
MAPK14 gene expression Real-time TaqManTM PCR was
performed with GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For PCR amplification and
signal detection the StepOneTM Real-Time PCR system
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Ct values were
normalized to RPL26 and differences of gene expression
were calculated with the DDCt method.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Standard
analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism
5 (GraphPad, Inc, San Diego, CA) using Student’s t-test.
A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
