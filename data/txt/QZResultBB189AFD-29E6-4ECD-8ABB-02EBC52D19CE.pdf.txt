Pretherapeutic Uracil and Dihydrouracil
Levels of Colorectal Cancer Patients Are
Associated With Sex and Toxic Side Effects
During Adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil–Based
Chemotherapy
Yvonne Wettergren, PhD; Göran Carlsson, MD, PhD; Elisabeth Odin, BSc; and Bengt Gustavsson, MD, PhD

BACKGROUND: In Nordic countries, the standard treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the adjuvant setting is
bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin alone or in combination with oxaliplatin. 5-FU competes with the natural
occurring pyrimidine uracil (Ura) as a substrate for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD; enzyme commission
number 1.3.1.2). Low DPD activity is associated with toxicity during treatment. Pretherapeutic detection of DPD deficiency could prevent severe toxicity otherwise limiting drug administration. Assays showing that DPD deficiency
impairs breakdown of Ura to dihydrouracil (UH2) seem promising for clinical use. METHODS: Urine was collected
from 56 untreated volunteers and 143 patients with CRC before adjuvant treatment. Ura and UH2 were analyzed using
a column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography method that incorporates reversed-phase and cationexchange columns. Ura, UH2, and UH2/Ura levels were related to toxicity. RESULTS: Ura and UH2 in patients were not
different from controls. UH2 was significantly higher in women compared with men. The UH2/Ura ratio, however, did
not differ according to sex. Low UH2 and UH2/Ura levels were associated with diarrhea in men. Women experiencing
thrombocytopenia had significantly higher Ura compared with women with no thrombocytopenia. The UH2/Ura ratio
correlated negatively with total toxicity score in men (r ¼ 0.39, P ¼ .020). CONCLUSION: Pretherapeutic Ura and
UH2 levels per se may be related to risk of side effects during adjuvant 5-FU–based treatment, whereas the UH2/Ura
ratio may not always reveal such a risk. Sex is a strong risk factor for toxicity, showing the importance of evaluating

INTRODUCTION

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was introduced into clinical use more than 50 years ago and has become the most commonly used anticancer drug for treatment of gastrointestinal cancer.1 There are several different methods and schedules
for administration of the drug. In Nordic countries, the standard treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the adjuvant setting is a bolus regimen with 5-FU in combination with bolus leucovorin (FLV), alone, or in combination with oxaliplatin.2,3 Although advancements in medical treatment of CRC have led to a reduced risk of recurrent disease and an
improved outcome of patients, far from all CRC patients will benefit from chemotherapeutic treatments. One reason for
this outcome might be that the initial dose given is too high at the individual level, resulting in toxic side effects. A lowering of the drug concentration or termination of treatment may be required to cope with the induced toxicity. Without successive, optimal chemotherapeutic courses, the clinical outcome of the patients may be impaired. The cause of the side

effects can be attributed to catabolic pathway deficiency.4
5-FU competes with the natural occurring pyrimidine
uracil (Ura) as a substrate for anabolic as well as catabolic
enzymes.5 Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD;
enzyme commission number 1.3.1.2) is the initial and
rate-controlling enzyme of endogenous pyrimidine and
fluoropyrimidine catabolism. The enzyme is present in
most tissues including tumors, and is highly active in the
liver and in peripheral lymphocytes.6 The activity of DPD
shows a wide range of individual variation.7 Low levels of
DPD have been associated with an increased risk of toxicity during 5-FU treatment.5
Considering the common use of intravenous 5-FU
and oral fluoropyrimidines, pretherapeutic detection of
DPD deficiency would be valuable, because it could prevent severe toxicity that would otherwise limit or delay
drug administration. Several methods have been developed for detection of DPD deficiency. Direct assaying of
DPD activity in blood lymphocytes using radio-enzymatic techniques has been the gold standard for experimental studies for several years.8 However, due to
methodological complexity, this technique is not suitable
for clinical use. The DPD gene expression level in lymphocytes, quantified by real-time PCR, has not shown
any correlation with 5-FU plasma clearance or plasma
dihydrouracil (UH2)/Ura ratio.9 Several polymorphisms
in the DPD gene have been reported to influence the
DPD activity; however, only a few of these seem to correlate with toxicity with high specificity. Furthermore, considering the high frequency of patients suffering from
5-FU–related toxicity and the low prevalence of patients
heterozygous for DPD polymorphisms (3%-5%),10 it is
clear that genotyping can only predict a minor percentage
of patients at risk of developing toxicity. The 2-13C Ura
breath test for assessment of DPD deficiency seems useful,
with a reported sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of
96%, but the method requires oral administration of
2-13C Ura.11 Alternative assays use the fact that DPD
deficiency impairs the breakdown of Ura to UH2 and the
UH2/Ura ratio may act as a potential biomarker to evaluate DPD levels in cancer patients. Assays that determine
the Ura concentration or the UH2/Ura ratio in plasma or
urine as a surrogate marker of DPD activity in the liver
seem promising for clinical use. In a recent review, Boisdron-Celle et al9 made a huge effort to determine which
method is simplest and most accurate for determination
of DPD deficiency before 5-FU–based treatment. The
results led them to propose a 2-step strategy for DPD deficiency detection in plasma. In the first step, SNP detec-

2936

tion in combination with measurement of the Ura
concentration was applied. In the second step, the UH2/
Ura ratio was determined to confirm the DPD deficiency
and to assess the DPD activity. The algorithm provided
83% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Determination of
the UH2/Ura ratio seemed to be the single best method to
determine the DPD activity level, though it was a bit
more time-consuming than the other 2 assays. Significant
correlations with liver DPD levels have been demonstrated for plasma and urine UH2/Ura ratios.6
Determination of the UH2/Ura ratio by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in blood or
urine seems to be a promising screening method that is
simple, rapid, and relatively inexpensive.12 Even combined
with other assays, however, only 80%-85% of the patients
that will experience toxicity can be predicted using this
method. Clearly, more needs to be learned about the regulation of the DPD gene and the interactions between the
DPD enzyme and adjuvant 5-FU–based chemotherapeutic
drugs. In the present study, the levels of Ura and UH2 were
measured in urine samples of CRC patients before the start
of adjuvant FLV or FLV þ oxaliplatin (FLOX) treatment.
The Ura, UH2, and UH2/Ura levels were analyzed with
regard to patients’ age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and
sensitivity to 5-FU–based chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
The study included 143 patients with nonhereditary CRC
who underwent a radical operation at the Sahlgrenska
University Hospital/Östra and were subjected to adjuvant
FLV (n ¼ 76) or FLOX (n ¼ 67) treatment between
2002 and 2009. The ethics committee of the University
of Gothenburg approved the study, and informed consent
was obtained from all patients. The median age of the
whole patient group at surgery was 63 years (range, 19-81
years), whereas it was 69 years (range, 44-81 years) and 59
years (range, 19-72 years) for patients treated with FLV
and FLOX, respectively. Seventy-four of the patients were
women and 69 were men. Tumors were classified according to the tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) staging system13 as TNM II (n ¼ 9) or TNM III (n ¼ 134). Patients
received FLV treatment in an adjuvant setting as intravenous bolus injections of 5-FU (500 mg/m2), followed by
FLV (60 mg/m2) 30-40 minutes later, once a week or on
days 1 and 2 every other week, according to the Nordic
FLV regimen.2 FLOX treatment was given as 5-FU (500
mg/m2) and FLV (100 mg) bolus on days 1 and 2 every

other week plus an oxaliplatin infusion (85 mg/m2) over
120 minutes on day 1 every other week.3 Side effects were
evaluated according the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(NCI-CTC AE) version 4.0 available at (https://
webapps.ctep.nci.nih.gov/webobjs/ctc/webhelp/Welcome_
to_CTCAE_1.htm). Indications for dose reduction were
grade 3-4, or repeated grade 2, toxicity.
Controls
The control group consisted of 56 randomly selected volunteers (34 women and 22 men). The median age of the
controls was 59 years (range, 31-87 years).
Urine Sampling
To minimize variations in DPD activity caused by circadian rhythm fluctuations, all urine samples were collected
in the morning.6 Ten milliliters of urine were collected
from the individuals of the control group, and from the
patients before the start of drug administration. The samples were kept frozen at 30 C until analyzed. Before
HPLC analysis, the frozen samples were thawed and transferred to a 5-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane filter
(Millipore) and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at
12,000g. Creatinine was enzymatically measured using
photometric determination on a Modular P instrument
(Roche Diagnostics Scandinavia AB, Bromma, Sweden).
HPLC
The HPLC system (Waters) consisted of an automatic injector (Model 717), 2 pumps (660E and 515), and an inline degasser. Two UV/visible variable wavelength detectors (models 486 and 484) were used. The detector wavelength was set to 220 nm (detector 484) or 210 nm
(detector 486). The total analysis time for each sample
was approximately 40 minutes. Integration of detector
output was performed using Millenium software to determine the peak areas. A column-switching HPLC method
was used to separate and quantify Ura and UH2. The first
column was a C18 reversed-phase column (Waters) and
the second was a cation-exchange column (SHODEX
1011) maintained at 30 C in a column oven. Ura and
UH2 were purchased from Sigma.
Measurements of Ura and UH2 in Urine
Fifty microliters of urine were injected into the HPLC
machine. After running the sample through the first column for 10 minutes, the column was washed using 5 mM
H2SO4 (Merck Chemicals) and 2% acetonitrile (BDH

Prolabo Chemicals) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
To separate Ura from UH2, fractions of the eluate from
the first column were sampled at 2.5-5 minutes and then
switched over to the second column. Elution was performed isocratically from the second column with a mobile phase consisting of 5 mM H2SO4 and a flow rate of
0.8 mL/min. The Ura and UH2 concentrations measured
at wavelength 210 nm were used to calculate the UH2/
Ura ratio.
Toxicity
To obtain larger subgroups when analyzing associations
between side effects and UH2, Ura, or UH2/Ura levels,
the patients were analyzed as 1 group regardless of treatment. The toxicity was evaluated according to a 5-graded
scale (NCI-CTC AE). The total toxicity score of a patient
was calculated by adding up the toxicity grades (0-4) of
each evaluated side effect (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, dermatological reactions, and dry eyes). Thus, the minimal score
would be zero, and the maximal score would be 36. The
scores of 3 patients were not included in the statistical
analysis because complete information regarding all side
effects was lacking for them.
Statistical Analysis
The obtained data were analyzed by statistical modeling
using the commercial software JMP.14 Unless otherwise
stated, the data are presented as the mean  standard deviation (SD). Differences between groups were tested using
the Kruskal-Wallis test or Pearson chi-square test. To
compare sets of continuous parameters measured in the
same sample, the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was
used. The statistical significance of the difference in the
groups was calculated using the log-rank test. P<.05 was
considered significant. No corrections for multiple testing
were done.

RESULTS
Linearity, Precision, and Accuracy of HPLC
The peak areas of Ura and UH2 in standard samples were
used to construct calibration curves. The curves were linear over the concentration range of 6.25-0.0625 nmol/50
lL. A typical equation describing the standard line was y
¼ 746.5x-83.5 for Ura and y ¼ 390.3x-103 for UH2. The
mean regression coefficient (R2) for n ¼ 32 calibration
curves was 1.0 for Ura as well as for UH2. The UH2/Ura
ratio showed a within-day precision of 7.9% (relative SD

Ura, UH2, and UH2/Ura Levels in Controls and
Patients
The mean  SD urinary Ura and UH2 concentrations in
controls were not significantly different from those of the
patients, nor was the mean UH2/Ura ratio (Table 1). No
significant correlation between the Ura and UH2 concentrations was found in the controls (r ¼ 0.16; P ¼ .25),
whereas there was a significant positive correlation
between the mean Ura and UH2 levels in the patients (r ¼
0.29; P ¼ .0004).
Ura, UH2, and UH2/Ura Levels According to
Sex and Age in Controls and Patients
In controls, the mean Ura and UH2 levels were significantly higher in women compared with men (Table 1).
The UH2/Ura ratio, however, did not differ according to
sex. In patients, the UH2 level, but not the Ura or UH2/
Ura levels, was significantly higher in women compared
with men. Furthermore, in controls, the UH2 concentration and the UH2/Ura ratio correlated positively with age
(Table 2). After subgrouping according to sex, a signifi-

2938

cant correlation with age was only detected among men.
No correlation between Ura, UH2, or UH2/Ura and age
could be found (Table 2).
Ura, UH2, and UH2/Ura Levels According
to BMI
The UH2/Ura ratio was significantly correlated with BMI
(r ¼ .19; P ¼ .024), and again, a sex difference was noted.
BMI correlated with UH2 (r ¼ 0.32; P ¼ .0068) and
UH2/Ura (r ¼ 0.35; P ¼ .0030) levels in men, but not in
women. The mean BMI of men, however, was not different from that of women (25  3.5 vs 25  3.9; P ¼ .28).
Toxicity During Treatment
Patients were analyzed as a whole group regardless of
treatment (Table 3) as well as after subgrouping according
to treatment regime. The results showed that gastrointestinal toxicity (especially vomiting and diarrhea) was common during FLV-treatment, whereas gastrointestinal and
hematological toxicity (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia,
and neutropenia) were common during FLOX treatment.
The toxicity was generally more common and more severe
among women compared with men, regardless of treatment. Out of the 143 analyzed patients, 113 (78%)

Ura levels were found to be associated with diarrhea
among men (Table 4). The mean UH2/Ura ratio was 1.5
 0.96 (n ¼ 37), 1.3  0.86 (n ¼ 11), 1.1  0.75 (n ¼
15), and 0.58  0.41 (n ¼ 5) for men experiencing grade
0, 1, 2, and 3-4 diarrhea, respectively (P ¼ .042). In addition, the mean UH2 concentration decreased gradually,
from 39  12 in men with no diarrhea to 18  11 in men
with diarrhea grades 3-4 (P ¼ .0065). No association with
the Ura level and toxicity could be seen in men, however.
In contrast, women with diarrhea had a higher mean
UH2/Ura ratio than those with no diarrhea (Table 5). It
should be noted, though, that women with toxicity grades
3-4 did have a lower ratio (1.4  0.61; n ¼ 21) than
women experiencing toxicity grade 2 (1.7  1.3; n ¼ 19).
Furthermore, women suffering from leucopenia had a significantly lower UH2/Ura ratio reflected by a higher mean
Ura level compared with women with no leucopenia. The
mean Ura level of women with thrombocytopenia was
also significantly higher, although there was no significant
difference seen with regard to the UH2/Ura level.
When the mean UH2/Ura ratio was plotted against
the total toxicity score in men and women, respectively, a
significant negative correlation (r ¼ 0.39; P ¼ .020) was
detected among men but not women treated with FLV
(Figure 1). Further analysis showed that gastrointestinal
toxicity (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) contributed
most to the negative correlation (r ¼ 0.41; P ¼ .012).
No correlation was detected in patients treated with
FLOX, regardless of sex. Patients were also analyzed
according to the Ura/UH2 level and the need for dose

2940

reduction during FLV treatment (97% of the FLOXtreated patients needed to reduce the dose and were not
included in the statistical analysis). The UH2/Ura level
was found to be half as low (0.92  0.42 vs 1.8  1.2; P
¼ .053) in men who needed to lower the 5-FU dose (n ¼
22) compared with men who did not (n ¼ 15). The ratio
was even lower (0.77  0.38) in 6 men who needed to disrupt treatment due to toxicity. In contrast, the UH2/Ura
ratio tended to be higher among women who required a
dose reduction (1.8  1.2; n ¼ 25) compared with
women who did not (1.2  0.54; n ¼ 14; P ¼ .16).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, a simple and rapid HPLC method
was used to determine the concentrations of Ura and
UH2 in urine samples obtained from untreated volunteers, as well as from CRC patients before the start of adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment. The results showed
that neither the mean Ura or UH2 levels nor the UH2/
Ura ratio of the patients were significantly different from
those of the control group. Previously, Hayashi et al15
established a reference range for urinary Ura and UH2 levels in Japanese adults (624 men and 509 women) aged 2098 years (mean  SD, 58.7  18.3 years). The mean 
SD Ura and UH2 levels were found to be 63.8  66.0
lmol/g and 23.8  35.5 lmol/g creatinine, respectively,
and the mean  SD UH2/Ura ratio was 0.36  0.18.
Thus, compared with our study, the UH2/Ura ratio of the
Japanese individuals was much lower. The reason for the

Figure 1. Mean dihydrouracil (UH2)/uracil (Ura) ratio is plotted against the total toxicity score of (A) men (n ¼ 36) and
(B) women (n ¼ 39) treated with bolus 5-fluorouracil in combination with leucovorin.

large difference in the Ura and UH2 levels is presently
unknown, but may be due to genetic or dietary differences
between Asian and European populations.
In concordance with previous results,16-18 women
were found to suffer more than men from all side effects
during treatment. The reason for this difference may in
part be explained by a lower capacity to clear 5-FU in
women compared with men.19 Because a lower capacity
to clear 5-FU may relate to a lower DPD activity, the
UH2/Ura ratio was expected to be lower in women than
in men. However, the mean UH2/Ura ratio was equal
among men and women. In contrast, significantly higher
Ura levels were found in women compared with men, a
result that also has been reported by Hayashi et al.15 The
consequences of the sex-related difference in Ura concentration are currently unknown, but the question arises as

Cancer

to whether the Ura level per se can be associated with the
different toxicity profiles of men and women. Results presented by Boisdron-Celle et al,9 who analyzed pretherapeutic Ura and UH2 levels in plasma from CRC patients,
points in that direction. In their prospective study,
patients were treated in the adjuvant (n ¼ 126) or palliative (n ¼ 126) setting by biweekly 5-FU bolus/infusion
þ leucovorin (n ¼ 168) or weekly 5-FU infusion þ leucovorin (n ¼ 84). 5-FU-related side effects at the first or
second cycle were taken into account and graded for severity. A significant negative correlation was found
between the Ura concentration and 5-FU plasma clearance with both protocols, and the higher the level of Ura,
the more severe toxicity the patients experienced. However, a significant positive correlation between the UH2/
Ura ratio and 5-FU plasma clearance was only detected
when the UH2/Ura ratio was below the median value,
and only in patients treated with the 5-FU bolus/infusion
regimen. In a study by Gamelin et al,20 the pretreatment
UH2/Ura ratios in plasma of patients treated in the palliative setting with continuous infusions of 5-FU were
shown to be highly correlated to 5-FU plasma concentrations, 5-FU plasma clearance, and optimal therapeutic 5FU dose of an individual (after the first treatment cycle).
In the present study, the Ura concentration was
higher in women suffering from leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, but the high Ura level was only reflected in a
significantly lower UH2/Ura for leucopenia, showing the
importance of evaluating Ura and UH2 separately. Interestingly, diarrhea tended to be associated with a low Ura
concentration and high UH2/Ura ratio in women.
Another, somewhat surprising, finding of the study was
that women who needed a dose reduction actually had a
higher UH2/Ura ratio compared with women who did
not (although the difference did not reach significance).
In this case, the higher ratio seemed to be related to a high
UH2 concentration. For men, diarrhea was the only specific side effect found to be associated with a low UH2/
Ura ratio. A negative correlation between the total toxicity
score and the UH2/Ura ratio was found in men but not in
women treated with FLV. Furthermore, men who had to
decrease the 5-FU dose during treatment had a lower
UH2/Ura ratio compared with men who did not. In samples of men who disrupted treatment due to toxicity, the
ratio was even lower.

toxicity after weekly bolus 5-FU plus low-dose folinic acid
as adjuvant treatment for CRC was found to be significantly associated with female sex and age >65 years.

Original Article

According to their results, women are expected to have either higher Ura levels, or lower UH2 levels, than men, and
the level is expected to be associated with age. In the previous study by Hayashi et al,15 as well as in our study, the
Ura levels were indeed found to be significantly higher in
women compared with men. In the study by Hayashi et
al, however, the Ura level was significantly lower in
patients aged 60 years compared with those aged <60
years, whereas the Ura level only tended to be negatively
correlated with age in healthy men in the present study.
Body weight differences between men and women
could be a reason for differences in drug pharmacokinetics and subsequent toxicity, because drug concentrations are dependent on the volume of distribution.
Gusella et al22 studied 181 CRC patients treated with
adjuvant FLV and found that the 5-FU area under the
concentration time curve (AUC) measured at the first
cycle was significantly correlated with drug dose, body
weight, and sex, with women having higher AUCs. However, the only covariates that discriminated between toxic
and nontoxic cycles were AUC and age. Although the
authors presented a method for calculating the initial 5FU dose by taking into account body weight, sex, and a
target AUC, they concluded that a substantial part of 5FU toxicity is not linked to pharmacokinetic factors. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the toxicity profiles on 5
North Central Cancer Treatment Group CRC treatment
trials was undertaken by Sloan et al.23 Data for 1093
women and 1355 men from 12 different treatment arms
in the setting of adjuvant colon or advanced CRC were
included. As expected, the results showed that women
receiving 5-FU–based chemotherapy in a 5-day bolus
schedule experienced toxicity more frequently and with
more severity than men. Logistic regression confirmed the
univariate findings while adjusting for the effects of study,
dose, BMI, and age. In the present study, no difference in
mean BMI was detected between women and men, yet
the UH2 and UH2/Ura levels correlated positively with
the BMI of men, but not women. These data raise the
question of whether the recommended initial dose of 5FU–based chemotherapy for women should be lower
than that for men.
Variations in DPD activity may result from alterations of the DPD gene at the transcriptional level. Ezzeldin et al24 reported that methylation of the DPD
promoter region was associated with down-regulation of
DPD activity in clinical samples, and the authors concluded that methylation should be considered as a potentially important regulatory mechanism of DPD activity

2942

and basis for 5-FU toxicity in cancer patients. However,
their results were contradicted by those of another group
using the same method but analyzing a different patient
population.25 Possibly, dietary differences between populations (which, for example, could be related to folate
supplementation of cereals) may affect the folate status in
the cells, which, in turn, may affect DNA methylation.
At present, it is unknown whether 5-FU and/or FLV
(formyl tetrahydrofolate) induce alterations in the methylation pattern of DPD during treatment leading to alterations in DPD activity and, consequently, in the UH2/
Ura ratio. However, if this proves to be true, Ura and
UH2 should be measured on several occasions during treatment to predict toxicity and adjustments of the 5-FU-dose
should be made accordingly. The interplay between Ura
and folate in the cells is intricate and deserves to be analyzed further. Incorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphate
in place of deoxythymidine triphosphate in DNA occurs
during folate deficiency, which is common in CRC. Excision of Ura by Ura-DNA glucosylase may lead to an excess
of free Ura in the cells. Because 5-FU and Ura compete
for DPD, the availability of free Ura may affect the
degradation of 5-FU and, hence, the toxicity. In addition,
mutations leading to less activity of the downstream
enzymes dihydropyrimidinase (enzyme commission number 3.5.2.2) or beta-ureidopropionase (enzyme class
3.5.1.6), encoded by the DPYS and UPB1 genes, respectively, might impair the uracil catabolism.26-28
Although the relatively small number of cases
included in the present study might lead to a limited statistical power, especially for subgroup analyses, the results
indicate an association of the urinary Ura and UH2 levels
with adverse drug reactions that deserves further study in
a larger patient cohort. An extended study on adjuvantly
treated CRC patients is now ongoing, and a new study on
the association of urinary Ura and UH2 levels with toxicity among patients treated with 5-FU–based treatment in
the palliative setting has started. In these studies, samples
are collected on several occasions during treatment to follow changes that might occur in DPD activity in response
to treatment. We will also investigate whether medication
and/or dietary factors (eg, caffeine, which is metabolized
in the liver to Ura derivatives)29 influence Ura and UH2
urinary levels.
In conclusion, the results of the present study show
that HPLC analysis of urinary Ura and UH2 levels of
patients undergoing chemotherapeutical treatment seems
promising for clinical use to predict and prevent occurrence of treatment-related toxicities. Pretherapeutic Ura

and UH2 levels per se may be related to side effects developed during adjuvant 5-FU treatment, whereas measuring
the UH2/Ura ratio alone may not always reveal such a
risk. A low urinary UH2/Ura ratio in men seems to be
associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, whereas a high
Ura level in women might predict for hematological toxicity. Sex is a strong risk factor for toxicity, possibly overriding the effect of most other putative predictive factors,
and showing the importance of evaluating male and
female patients separately.
