Abstract
We report the first use of new synthetic triterpenoids to
prevent lung cancer in experimental animals. Female A/J mice
were treated with the mutagenic carcinogen vinyl carbamate,
which induces adenocarcinoma of the lung in all animals
within 16 weeks. If mice were fed either the methyl ester or
the ethyl amide derivative of the synthetic triterpenoid 2cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-ME
and CDDO-EA, respectively), beginning 1 week after dosing
with carcinogen, the number, size, and severity of lung carcinomas were markedly reduced. The mechanisms of action of
CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA that are germane to these in vivo
findings are the following results shown here in cell culture:
(a) suppression of the ability of IFN-; to induce de novo
formation of nitric oxide synthase in a macrophage-like cell
line RAW264.7, (b) induction of heme oxygenase-1 in these
RAW cells, and (c) suppression of phosphorylation of the
transcription factor signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 as well as induction of apoptosis in human
lung cancer cell lines. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2414–9]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 15% and more than 150,000
deaths annually. Prevention is clearly required to reduce both
morbidity and mortality, as 5-year survival rates have not increased
substantially during the past 35 years. The connection between
inflammation and carcinogenesis (1, 2) has led us to synthesize
and test a new set of anti-inflammatory triterpenoids to prevent
cancer. The most potent of these new agents, such as 2-cyano3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), its methyl
ester (CDDO-ME), and CDDO-Imidazolide (CDDO-IM), are some
of the strongest known inhibitors of the de novo synthesis of
inflammatory enzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS) and inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (3–6). In addition to their
anti-inflammatory actions, CDDO and its derivatives are also
multifunctional compounds that induce differentiation, inhibit cell
proliferation, and selectively induce apoptosis of a wide variety of
cancer cells, including human lung cancer cells (4, 7–9). Both CDDO

and CDDO-ME are currently in phase I clinical trials for treatment of
leukemia and solid tumors.
Newer amide derivatives of CDDO are also promising agents. In
addition to the methyl amide of CDDO (CDDO-MA; ref. 10), the
ethyl amide (CDDO-EA) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl amide (CDDOTFEA) have recently been made for the first time, using a synthetic
procedure similar to that used for making the methyl amide. These
newly synthesized amides, as will be shown here, are highly active
in relevant cell culture assays at concentrations that can be
obtained in vivo; moreover, they have recently been shown to have
good pharmacodynamic activity in mouse lung (11). Because new
drugs are urgently needed for prevention of human lung cancer, we
have tested one of the new amides (CDDO-EA) as well as CDDOME in a highly relevant A/J mouse model (12, 13). We report here
for the first time the use of synthetic triterpenoids to prevent
adenocarcinoma of the lung, as measured by a striking reduction in
number, size, and severity of tumors.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. CDDO-ME and three amide derivatives (CDDO-MA, CDDOEA, and CDDO-TFEA) were synthesized as described (5, 10, 11). For cell
culture studies, compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and controls
containing equal concentrations of DMSO (V0.1%) were included in all
experiments.
Cell culture assays. The RAW264.7 and A549 cell lines (American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Apoptosis was analyzed
either by Western blotting of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage
or by flow cytometry using the TACS Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and CELLQuest software (Becton
Dickinson, San Diego, CA). For Western blots, total cell lysates were resolved
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with
antibodies against phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 (STAT3; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or PARP (Upstate,
Milford, MA), as described (14).
Prevention of lung cancer. Female A/J mice (7–8 weeks of age; The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected i.p. with two doses of
vinyl carbamate (0.32 mg per mouse; Toronto Research Chemicals,
Ontario, Canada) dissolved in isotonic saline, 1 week apart and then
randomized into treatment groups. After waiting 1 week following the
second injection of carcinogen, mice were fed triterpenoids in semisynthetic AIN-93G diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) for 15 weeks. At
necropsy, lungs were removed and inflated with neutral buffered formalin.
After fixation, grossly visible lesions on the surface of the left lung were
counted and sized with a reticule on a dissecting microscope. Then, the
lung was step-sectioned (300 Am between sections) beginning at the
medial hilar surface, and 5-Am sagittal sections were stained with H&E.
Numbers of tumors and their size and histopathology were evaluated on
two sections of each lung. Both gross and histologic analyses of the lungs

were done in a blinded fashion by two independent investigators. Results
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test, and the
histopathology was analyzed by one-way ANOVA on ranks and Dunn’s test
(SigmaStat3.5).

Results
CDDO-ME and amide derivatives of CDDO enhance synthesis
of HO-1, suppress phosphorylation of STAT3, and induce
apoptosis in vitro. Our use of synthetic triterpenoids for prevention
of lung cancer is based on mechanistic considerations, especially
their ability to induce anti-inflammatory enzymes (such as HO-1)
and to suppress the functional activity of transcription factors (such
as the STATs) that not only enhance the inflammatory process but
also enhance carcinogenesis. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1A, amide
derivatives of CDDO are potent inducers of HO-1, an important
anti-inflammatory protein (15). The induction of HO-1 by
triterpenoids is part of the ‘‘phase 2’’ response mediated by the
transcription factor Nrf2 (16); drugs that induce activity of Nrf2 are
important for chemoprevention (17). Figure 1A also shows that
CDDO-MA, CDDO-EA, and CDDO-TFEA are all more potent than
CDDO itself as inducers of HO-1. Another important antiinflammatory action of the triterpenoids is their ability to suppress

de novo synthesis of iNOS, the enzyme responsible for high-output
NO production. Thus, in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells, we found
that CDDO-EA and CDDO-ME were 7- and 15-fold more potent,
respectively, than CDDO as suppressors of the ability of IFN-g to
induce iNOS (data not shown); IC50 for CDDO-ME was 1 nmol/L.
Another set of proteins that contribute to inflammation and
carcinogenesis are the STAT family of transcription factors. STATs
are often constitutively activated in many cancers (18), and we
have recently reported that CDDO-IM suppresses constitutive
STAT3 phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in human lung
cancer cells (14). Here, we show in human lung cancer cells that
CDDO-ME and three amide derivatives of CDDO also were highly
effective in blocking constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B).
Yet another important mechanism for chemoprevention is the
induction of apoptosis (19). Thus, CDDO-EA, CDDO-TFEA, and
CDDO-ME all are potent inducers of apoptosis in A549 lung cancer
cells, as shown both by PARP cleavage (Fig. 1C) and Annexin
staining (Fig. 1D). We also found similar effects on STAT
phosphorylation and apoptosis with these triterpenoids in H358
and A427 human lung cancer cells (data not shown), but here, we
emphasize results with A549 cells, a cell line extremely resistant to
inhibition of growth by CDDO and CDDO-ME (9).

Figure 2. Histopathology of lung tumors. Invasive lung tumors were assigned nuclear and histologic grade. Tumors of low grade are minimally expansive, with
non-fused trabecular growth and aerated airspaces visible between alveolar septa invaded by tumor and with round, uniform nuclei and indistinct nucleoli. In contrast,
high-grade tumors display obliterative and solid growth, with pleomorphic nuclei featuring prominent nucleoli and conspicuous mitoses. See text for further details
of criteria for grading.

Assay of levels of triterpenoids in blood and lungs. The data
shown in Fig. 1 indicate that synthetic triterpenoids have potent
activities in cell cultures that are relevant to suppression of carcinogenesis. The question then arises whether suitable levels of drug
can be achieved in vivo. We have found that administration of
1 Amole of either CDDO-EA or CDDO-ME (dissolved in DMSO)
by gavage to mice gives levels of 500 or 250 nmol/kg, respectively,
in mouse lung 6 h after gavage. In mice chronically fed ( for
10 weeks) the same dose of CDDO-EA used in the carcinogenesis
experiments described below, we found that CDDO-EA levels were
400 nmol/kg in lung and 1 Amol/L in blood. Thus, it is clear that
pharmacologically useful levels of both CDDO-EA and CDDO-ME
can be obtained by oral administration of these drugs. Further data
supporting the choice of CDDO-EA and CDDO-ME for studies of
prevention of lung cancer were the high activity of these agents
(after oral administration) for inducing mRNA expression of the
phase 2 enzyme Nqo1 in mouse lung (11).

to induction of tumors by cigarette smoke or various carcinogens
(13). Vinyl carbamate, a potent mutagen and much stronger
carcinogen than its relative ethyl carbamate (urethane), induces
carcinomas in the lung in these mice as early at 16 weeks after
dosing (12). In our laboratory, essentially all lung tumors seen 16
weeks after treatment with two doses of vinyl carbamate in female
A/J mice have consistently been carcinomas, with an invasive and
histologically malignant phenotype within individual tumors. Thus,
in the present study, 193 of 195 tumors in mice receiving carcinogen
alone showed stromal invasion or obliteration of lung architecture,
some with endobronchial growth. In essentially all these tumors,
carcinoma cells can be seen infiltrating along cells of adjacent
alveoli. Figure 2 (top right) shows a tumor invading into a bronchus.
In addition to the assessment of invasion, the tumors were assigned
histologic and nuclear grade, based on set and reproducible
microscopic patterns and criteria. Tumors of low histologic grade
are minimally expansive, with non-fused trabecular growth and
with areas of aerated alveoli visible between septa involved by the
tumors. In contrast, tumors of high histologic grade show
tumefactive and solid growth, with obliteration of normal structures

and fused trabecula. Low nuclear grade is defined by the presence of
minimal pleomorphism and anisonucleosis, with round and
generally uniform nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, and inconspicuous
mitoses. High nuclear grade features larger and variably sized
nuclei, with coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli, nuclear
membrane abnormalities, and conspicuous mitoses. These characteristics are represented in the tumors shown in Fig. 2.
CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA reduce the number, size, and
severity of lung tumors in vivo. To test the ability of the
triterpenoids to prevent lung cancer, mice were fed CDDO-ME
(60 mg/kg diet) or CDDO-EA (400 mg/kg diet), beginning 1 week
after the second injection of vinyl carbamate. Vinyl carbamate is
a reactive, water-soluble carcinogen that is rapidly metabolized to
a reactive epoxide (20); thus, it is highly unlikely that any active
carcinogen remained in the mice at the time when chemoprevention of carcinogenesis was started. At these doses, CDDO-EA
was well tolerated, but to eliminate weight loss in the CDDO-ME
group, the mice were fed CDDO-ME for 2 weeks and then switched
to a week of control diet. We have used such an intermittent
feeding protocol successfully in other chemoprevention studies. At
autopsy after 15 weeks on diet, the number of tumors on the
surface of the lungs (Fig. 3) was reduced by almost 50% in the mice
fed CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA, with an average of 7.4 and 7.8
tumors, respectively, in the treated groups compared with an
average of 15.8 tumors in the lungs of control mice (P < 0.001,

Table 1). More importantly, Table 1 shows that the size of the
tumors was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller in the mice fed
triterpenoids, as no tumors in either of these groups were >1 mm in
diameter, whereas 20% of the tumors in the control group were >1
mm. Furthermore, 63% and 70% of the tumors seen in the CDDOME and CDDO-EA groups, respectively, were <0.5 mm in diameter
versus only 3% in the control lungs.
The highly significant decrease in the number and size (P <
0.05) of tumors observed on the surface of the lungs was also
observed on lung sections. The average number of tumors per
slide for CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA, respectively, was only 21% and
24% of control, and most significantly, average total tumor
volume per slide decreased from 7.5 mm3 in the control group to
0.1 to 0.2 mm3 in the groups treated with triterpenoids (P < 0.05).
Most notably, the severity of the histopathology was significantly
reduced by CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA, with almost half of the
tumors in these two groups classified as noninvasive, compared
with only 1% in the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, no highgrade lesions were seen in the mice treated with CDDO-EA, and
only one high-grade tumor was observed in the mice treated with
CDDO-ME, whereas 36% of the control tumors were high grade at
the histologic or nuclear level. High-grade lesions comprised 64%
of the total tumor volume in the control slides, whereas the
percentage was only 16% and 0% with CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA,
respectively.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of synthetic
oleanane triterpenoids to prevent the occurrence of invasive
carcinomas in an animal model, after initiation of highly
malignant lesions by a highly mutagenic carcinogen. The selection
of the triterpenoids used in this study was based on knowledge of
their mechanisms of action that are relevant to the suppression of
carcinogenesis. Thus, as shown in Results, the anti-inflammatory
actions of these agents in vitro (i.e., induction of HO-1,
suppression of STAT phosphorylation, and inhibition of synthesis
of iNOS) all may contribute to the anticarcinogenic action of
CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA. There is now abundant evidence that
the process of inflammation plays a critical role in promoting
carcinogenesis (1, 2). It has previously been shown that CDDO-IM
can suppress the formation of premalignant lesions in the livers of
rats treated with aflatoxin, although in these studies, CDDO-IM
was given before and during the carcinogen dosing (21). In the
present study, we now show that CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA
suppress carcinogenesis even when given after carcinogenic DNA
damage has occurred; thus, they are effective in suppressing the
expression of the malignant phenotype during the promotion/
progression stage of carcinogenesis. The carcinogen used in these
experiments is known to cause K-ras mutations (22) that are
highly relevant not only to human lung cancer but also to many
other forms of malignancy as well. The use of the two
triterpenoids (CDDO-ME and CDDO-EA) suppressed carcinogenesis induced by vinyl carbamate at three different levels: (a) the
incidence of tumors, (b) the size of tumors, and (c), most notably,
the severity of the tumors, with only a single high-grade lesion

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

found in 24 mice treated with vinyl carbamate plus the
triterpenoids, whereas 70 high-grade tumors were seen in 29
mice treated with the carcinogen alone.
Although Fig. 1 already shows some of the mechanisms
whereby triterpenoids suppress carcinogenesis, further studies
are clearly required. The triterpenoids were not fed to the mice
until a full week after the last injection of vinyl carbamate,
which clearly indicates that their efficacy in our model is not due
to their acting as anti-initiating agents by altering the metabolism
of the carcinogen. One important activity of the triterpenoids
as anti-promoting agents is their ability to activate the Keap/
Nrf2/ARE pathway because activation of this phase 2 enzyme
cytoprotective response is highly correlated to their antiinflammatory activity (16, 23, 24). Stimulating the Nrf2 pathway
is now thought to be an attractive target for cancer prevention
(17, 25).
It is already known that CDDO and its congeners form Michael
adducts with thiol groups on cysteine residues of target proteins.
Some of these direct targets, such as Keap1 (23), an inhibitor of
the Nrf2 transcription factor that regulates the phase 2 cytoprotective response, and InB kinase (26, 27) have already been
identified, but given the fact that the triterpenoids form reversible
Michael adducts with thiol groups, there are undoubtedly other
targets, presently unknown, that contribute to the anticarcinogenic effect. The current clinical trials of both CDDO and CDDOME for cancer therapy, if successful, should enhance interest in
identifying the overall mechanisms of action of these promising
chemopreventive agents. Beyond these studies with derivatives of
oleanolic acid, other triterpenoid platforms, such as betulinic

acid, also need to be considered for development of new agents
to prevent lung cancer (28, 29).
