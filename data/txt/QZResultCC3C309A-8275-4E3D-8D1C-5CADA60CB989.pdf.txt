Author Manuscript

Women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are at greater risk of developing and dying from breast
cancer than women without T2DM. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia underlie the
pathogenesis of T2DM. In the MKR mouse model of insulin resistance, we have previously shown
increased activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway in
association with accelerated mammary tumor growth. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibiting
PI3K with the oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, NVP-BKM120 reduced the growth of Met-1 and
MCNeuA mammary tumor orthografts in the MKR mouse. NVP-BKM120 treatment decreased
phosphorylation of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein (S6rp); no change in Erk1/2 phosphorylation
was seen. Hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and greater hyperinsulinemia developed in the
MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120. We previously reported reduced tumor growth using
intraperitoneal rapamycin in the MKR mouse, with the development of hyperglycemia and
hypertriglyceridemia. Therefore, we examined whether the oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235 augmented the tumor suppressing effects of PI3K inhibition. We also investigated the
effect of targeted PI3K/mTOR inhibition on PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Erk1/2 signaling, and the
potential effects on glycemia. NVP-BEZ235 suppressed the growth of Met-1 and MCNeuA tumor
orthografts, and decreased Akt and S6rp phosphorylation, despite increased Erk1/2
phosphorylation in Met-1 orthografts of MKR mice. Less marked hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia developed with NVP-BEZ235 than NVP-BKM120. Overall, the results of this
study demonstrated that inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling with the oral agents NVP-BKM120
and NVP-BEZ235 decreased mammary tumor growth in the hyperinsulinemic MKR mouse.
Inhibiting PI3K alone led to more severe metabolic derangement than inhibiting both PI3K and
mTOR. Therefore, PI3K may be an important target for the treatment of breast cancer in women
with insulin resistance. Monitoring for hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia should be considered
when using these agents in humans, given the metabolic changes detected in this study.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the metabolic syndrome (a syndrome of
insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia) are at greater risk of developing and dying from
breast cancer than women without these conditions (Patterson 2010, Agnoli 2010, Peairs
2011). Even in the absence of T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, having a fasting insulin
level that lies in the upper quartile of the normal population range has been reported to
increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence and death, in women with early stage breast
cancer (Goodwin 2002). In human breast cancer, insulin receptor (IR) content is frequently
increased (Papa 1990) and therefore, in the setting of insulin resistance and
hyperinsulinemia, activation of the IR and its downstream signaling pathways may promote
breast cancer growth. In our previous studies, we have employed the female MKR mouse to
investigate the mechanisms underlying the link between hyperinsulinemia and breast cancer.
The female MKR mouse has significant insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia with mild
glucose intolerance (Novosyadlyy 2010). Our previous studies have demonstrated that
female MKR mice develop larger mammary tumors, than wild type (WT) mice. The IR/
insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mTOR pathway was the main signaling pathway that demonstrated increased activation in
tumors from the MKR mice (Novosyadlyy 2010).

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and its activation by IRβ / IGF-IRβ
phosphorylation has recently received intense investigation, with the emergence of
resistance to current chemotherapeutic agents and the identification of mutations that lead to
dysregulation of this pathway (Junttila 2009, Lopez-Knowles 2010, Creighton 2010). PI3K
consists of 2 subunits, a p110 catalytic subunit and its regulatory p85 subunit. After receptor
phosphorylation, binding of adaptor proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), to
the p85 subunit releases the p110 catalytic subunit from its inhibitory regulation and allows
for the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 phosphorylates Akt leading to the
activation of a plethora of signaling molecules. Multiple gene mutations can increase
signaling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in breast cancers, for example loss of
activity of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
chromosome ten (PTEN), amino acid substitutions in PI3KCA (encoding the p110α
catalytic subunit of PI3K), overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(HER-2) and mutations in Akt. In cell lines, increased PI3K signaling has been shown to
confer resistance to the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab that is directed against HER-2 and
is used to treat HER-2 receptor positive breast cancers in women (O’Brien NA 2010).
Additionally, in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cells, PI3K activity is
associated with decreased expression of ER and ER target genes. This decreased ER
expression in ER positive tumors is associated with resistance to hormonal therapy
(Creighton 2010). Therefore, insulin resistance and endogenous hyperinsulinemia, leading to

increased activation of the PI3K signaling pathway, may result in resistance to HER-2 and
ER targeted therapy and so may be an important therapeutic target in individuals with breast
cancer who have increased insulin levels, the metabolic syndrome or T2DM.

Author Manuscript

However, two particular concerns have arisen with regard to inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway. Firstly, that inhibition of PI3K signaling in HER-2 overexpressing tumors will lead
to a compensatory increase in Erk1/2 signaling, as was recently described with the PI3K
inhibitors, GDC-0941 and PIK-90 in cell lines and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235
in xenografts inoculated into mice (Serra 2011). The second concern is that inhibiting PI3K
may result in significant hyperglycemia. We have previously demonstrated that inhibiting
mTOR with rapamycin led to increased glucose and triglyceride levels in MKR mice, but
did not lead to a further increase in the already elevated plasma insulin levels and did not
affect Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt in tumors (Fierz 2010). PI3K inhibition would be
expected to lead to different metabolic effects than rapamycin, due to the effects of PI3K
inhibition on the phosphorylation of Akt and on atypical isoforms of protein kinase C
(PKC)ζ. Both Akt and atypical isoforms of PKCζ are important for insulin mediated glucose
uptake in muscle and adipose tissue by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) (Kohn 1996, Liu
2006).

Author Manuscript

Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of inhibiting PI3K on tumor progression and
metabolic parameters, in a mouse model of hyperinsulinemia. In this study we inhibited
PI3K with the oral pan-class I inhibitor of PI3K, NVP-BKM120 and evaluated the growth of
mammary tumor orthografts in the hyperinsulinemic MKR mouse. We examined the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to determine whether this inhibitor could adequately
block signaling in tumors from the MKR mouse, where the activity of this pathway is
known to be increased. We also studied the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 to determine whether
inhibition of PI3K led to a compensatory increase in Erk1/2 signaling in the MKR mouse.
Additionally, we examined the effects of inhibiting PI3K on metabolic parameters, including
glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels. Finally, in view of our previous study demonstrating
that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin led to hyperglycemia in the MKR mouse, but reduced
tumor growth (Fierz 2010), we were interested to know if inhibiting both PI3K and mTOR
with the targeted dual inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 would lead to an additional suppression of
tumor growth and if it would affect insulin and glucose levels in the MKR mouse. We also
aimed to discover whether the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor would lead to a compensatory
increase in Erk1/2 signaling in this model, similar to the results from animal models without
insulin resistance (Serra 2011).

Results
Inhibiting PI3K reduces tumor growth in the MKR mouse
The MKR mouse is a nonobese animal model of type 2 diabetes. The female MKR mouse
has marked hyperinsulinemia, but only mild dysglycemia. We have previously demonstrated
that after orthotopic inoculation of Met-1 and MCNeuA cells into the 4th mammary fat pad,
MKR mice develop larger tumors than wild-type (WT) mice (Novosyadlyy 2010). Met-1
mammary tumor cells were initially derived from MMTV-Polyoma Virus middle T antigen
(PyVmT) transgenic mice (Borowsky et al. 2005) and MCNeuA mammary tumor cells were

derived from MMTV-Neu transgenic mice, the rodent equivalent of the human ErbB2 or
HER-2 gene (Campbell et al. 2002). Met-1 cells have a high proliferation rate and have a
mesenchymal phenotype. MCNeuA cells have an epithelial phenotype and have a low
proliferation rate.

Author Manuscript

We orthotopically inoculated MKR mice and WT mice with Met-1 and MCNeuA cells, as
previously described (Novosyadlyy 2010). Cells were injected one week apart, to allow for
the lower proliferation rate of the MCNeuA cells. 2 weeks after injection of the Met-1 cells
and 3 weeks after injection of MCNeuA cells, the MKR and WT mice were divided into 2
treatment groups that were matched for respective tumor size (Figure 1A and 1C). Mice
were treated with NVP-BKM120 (50mg/kg) by oral gavage, or the same volume of the
vehicle. Treatment continued for 2 weeks with interval measurement of tumor growth over
that time and measurement of tumor weight at the end of the study. The volumes of both
Met-1 and MCNeuA tumors were significantly lower in the MKR mice treated with NVPBKM120, compared to the MKR vehicle treated group (Figure 1A and 1C). Similarly, the
weights of MCNeuA and Met-1 tumors were significantly reduced in the MKR group
treated with NVP-BKM120 and the MCNeuA tumor weights were also significantly reduced
in the WT group (Figure 1B and 1D). Therefore, in the insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic
mouse, inhibiting PI3K with NVP-BKM120 decreases the growth of mammary tumors
known to have increased activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

Our previous studies have demonstrated an increase in phosphorylation of IRβ(Tyr1150/1151) /
IGF-IRβ(Tyr1135/1136) and Akt(Ser473) in Met-1 and MCNeuA tumors inoculated into MKR
mice, compared to those injected into WT FVB/N mice (Novosyadlyy 2010). No change
was seen in phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473) in response to treatment with the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin (Fierz 2010). In this study, we again observed a statistically significant increase
in Akt(Ser473 phosphorylation in the MKR vehicle treated group compared to the WT vehicle
treated groups (Figure 2A, 2B, this difference is not marked with an asterisk on the
densitometry 2C and 2E). Inhibiting PI3K resulted in decreased phosphorylation of
Akt(Ser473) in both WT and MKR mice, along with decreased phosphorylation of S6
ribosomal protein(Ser235/236) (Figure 2A–2F). No change in Erk1/2(Thr202/204)
phosphorylation was seen in either WT or MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120 (Figure 2
G–J). Overall, NVP-BKM120 successfully reduces phosphorylation of Akt and S6
ribosomal protein in tumors from the MKR mouse that is known to have increased
activation of Akt signaling.. No change in Erk1/2 signaling was seen after treatment with
NVP-BKM120 in either cell type in MKR or WT mice.
Inhibiting PI3K led to reduced proliferation in Met-1 tumor orthografts in MKR mice
We have previously demonstrated increased proliferation in the Met-1 tumors in MKR mice
by evaluation of protein extracts for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on western
blot (Fierz 2010). To examine whether this increase in S phase growth was inhibited with
NVP-BKM120, the mice were injected with 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 2 hours prior
to tumor tissue collection. The percent of cells that stained positive for BrdU in the Met-1

tumors was evaluated by immunofluorescence. We found a significantly higher percent of
BrdU positive cells in the vehicle treated MKR mice (9.9 ±0.76%), compared to vehicle
treated WT mice (7.8±0.35%) (Figure 3A). Treatment of the MKR mice with NVPBKM120 led to a significantly lower percent of BrdU positive cells (5.8±1.13%), compared
to vehicle treated MKR mice (P=0.001). The percent of BrdU positive cells in the Met-1
tumors from the MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120 was comparable to the percent of
BrdU positive cells in the WT NVP-BKM120 treated group (5.8±0.63%). Therefore, in the
MKR mice, inhibiting PI3K with NVP-BKM120 attenuated the increased cellular
proliferation in Met-1 tumors from the MKR mice (Figure 3B). Western blot analysis of
apoptosis, using the antibody to the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 revealed decreased levels of
Bcl-2 when normalized to β actin, in the MKR vehicle treated group, compared to the MKR
NVP-BKM120 treated group (data not shown).

Comparison of PI3K inhibition alone with the PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor NVP-BEZ235

Before treatment, MKR mice had mildly elevated blood glucose levels (10.6 ±0.5 mmol/L),
compared to WT mice (7.2 ± 0.2 mmol/L) (Figure 4A). Following 2 weeks of treatment,
significant hyperglycemia developed in the WT and MKR groups treated with NVPBKM120 (Figure 4), and was demonstrated during the glucose tolerance test (Figure 4B).
Plasma insulin levels revealed that WT and MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120 had
significant hyperinsulinemia, compared to the vehicle treated mice, with the levels for the
WT mice increasing ~7 fold and for MKR mice rising more than 10 fold (Figure 4C).
Triglyceride levels also increased in the MKR mice treated with NVP-BKM120 to a modest
(1.5 fold increase) but significant degree, although no increase was seen in the WT mice
(Figure 4D).

We were interested to discover the effects of inhibiting both PI3K and mTOR on the tumor
growth and glucose control in the MKR mice. Our previous studies had demonstrated that
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduced tumor growth, but increased glucose levels in the
MKR mice, while our current study demonstrated that inhibiting PI3K with NVP-BKM120
also reduced tumor growth, but led to more severe hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia than
rapamycin. We therefore speculated that inhibiting both PI3K and mTOR could have a
synergistic effect on the reduction in tumor growth. Analogous to the study with NVPBKM120, we inoculated the 4th mammary fat pad of WT and MKR mice with Met-1 and
MCNeuA cells, and divided them into treatment groups, with the dual PI3K / mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (40mg tosylate salt/ kg body weight) or the vehicle (10% NMP:
90% PEG300), by daily gavage for 2 weeks. Before treatment began, the groups were
matched for tumor size, and serial measurements were taken during the study to calculate
the tumor volume. At the end of the study tumor weights were also recorded. Proteins from
the MCNeuA and Met-1 tumors were isolated, as previously described and again
phosphorylation of the Akt, S6 ribosomal protein and Erk1/2 were examined relative to their
total protein levels.
The volumes of both MCNeuA and Met-1 tumors were again significantly decreased in the
MKR mice treated with the dual PI3K / mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (Figure 5A, 5B),

tumor weight was not significantly different in the treatment groups as there was a wide
distribution in the tumor weights due to variable areas of necrosis (Figure 5C, 5D). Analysis
of tumor proteins revealed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and S6
ribosomal protein in the MKR and WT NVP-BEZ235 treated group, compared with the
vehicle treated groups (Fig 5E, 5F, 5G, 5I). In contrast to the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120,
an increase Erk1/2 phosphorylation was seen in the Met-1 tumors from MKR mice treated
with NVP-BEZ235, when compared to those treated with the vehicle (Figure 5J). Glucose
intolerance and hyperinsulinemia developed in the MKR mice treated with NVP-BEZ235
(Figure 6A, 6B), but the degree of glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia was not as
great as with NVP-BKM120 treatment. No significant hyperinsulinemia developed in the
WT group treated with NVP-BEZ235, compared to controls (Figure 6B).

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our results demonstrate that in the MKR mouse model of insulin resistance, inhibiting PI3K
with NVP-BKM120 decreased the growth of tumor orthografts known to have increased
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the hyperinsulinemic mouse. In the MKR
mouse, inhibiting PI3K alone reduced Akt phosphorylation and did not lead to a
compensatory increase in Erk1/2 signaling. In contrast to our study of rapamycin, inhibiting
both PI3K and mTOR led to a reduction in Akt phosphorylation as well as a decrease in
S6rp phosphorylation, however increased activation of Erk1/2 signaling in Met-1 tumors
from the MKR mouse treated with NVP-BEZ235 was seen. These results are partially
consistent with the findings of other groups, who reported that inhibition of PI3K alone
(with GDC-0941 and PIK90), or in combination with mTOR (NVP-BEZ235) led to a
compensatory increase in Erk1/2 signaling in tumor xenografts (Serra 2011). Notably, the
PI3K inhibitors used were different as were the cell lines and animal models, all of which
could account for the different findings regarding Erk1/2 phosphorylation.
Other studies, in addition to ours, have reported that inhibiting PI3K results in no change, or
in some cases, a reduction in Erk1/2 signaling (Wells 2007). As well as differences in
cellular characteristics, different pharmacological agents possess varying activity against the
different class 1A p110 isoforms of PI3K. Although in breast cancer, the PI3KCA gene that
encodes for the p110α, is the most commonly mutated of the 3 class 1A isoforms (p110α,
p110β, p110δ), evidence from other cell lines show that inhibiting 2 of these 3 isoforms is
insufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and survival (Foukas 2010). Therefore, PI3K
inhibitors that preferentially target p110α (GDC-0941 and PIK90), may not be as effective
at preventing cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression, as pan class 1A inhibitors
such as NVP-BKM120 and XL147.

Author Manuscript

The more pronounced glucose and insulin derangements in the WT and MKR mice treated
with the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120, may be the result of more pronounced PI3K and Akt
inhibition with this compound than with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Our
protein analysis demonstrated that the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation with NVP-BEZ235
was less marked than with the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120. Similar findings regarding
Akt phosphorylation have previously been reported, and other studies have demonstrated an
increase in Akt phosphorylation at lower doses of NVP-BEZ235 (Serra 2008, Serra 2011).

At low concentrations, NVP-BEZ235 predominantly inhibits mTORC1 activity, while at
higher concentrations it inhibits PI3K and mTORC1/2. Therefore, in our study, the
disproportionately greater suppression of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation, compared
to Akt phosphorylation in NVP-BEZ235 treated tumors, may be the result of the different
inhibitory concentration of NVP-BEZ235 on mTOR and Akt.

Insulin signaling is important for glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, by
the glucose transporter GLUT4. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibiting PI3K
with wortmannin and LY294002 prevents the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface and
glucose uptake into cells. Akt and atypical PKCζ are important downstream targets of PI3K
that mediate this glucose uptake (Liu 2006). Inhibitors of Akt have also been reported to
cause hyperglycemia, by GLUT4 dependent and independent mechanisms (Tan 2010). Only
very low levels of Akt appear to be necessary to maintain GLUT4 function in certain cells,
suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms are also in play (Tan 2010). The difference in
Akt inhibition between with NVP-BKM120 compared to NVP- BEZ235 may partly explain
the more dramatic hyperglycemia that was observed with NVP-BKM120. Some studies
using PI3K inhibitors have not reported dramatic hyperglycemia, an affect that may be
related to the p110 isoform of PI3K that is inhibited: a pan class IA inhibitor may lead to
more severe glucose derangement than a selective p110α inhibitor, although the roles that
the different p110 isoforms play in the metabolic effects of insulin remain to be determined
(Sopasakis 2010, Jia 2008).

Author Manuscript

In addition to more severe hyperglycemia, we noted more dramatic hyperinsulinemia with
the PI3K inhibitor compared with the dual PI3K/ mTOR inhibitor, which caused greater
hyperinsulinemia than rapamycin (Fierz 2010). Inhibition of PI3K and Akt will directly lead
to insulin resistance by preventing signal transduction through this pathway. Inhibiting
mTOR in addition to PI3K may in fact improve insulin sensitivity, as the mTOR/S6 Kinase
pathway causes serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which attenuates signaling. Therefore,
inhibiting mTOR/S6 Kinase activity may reduce some of the insulin resistance caused by
PI3K inhibition, by relieving the inhibition of serine phosphosylation of IRS-1 and allowing
tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of the insulin signaling pathway (Um
2006).

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that PI3K inhibitors reduce tumor growth in an
animal model of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. These results may be particularly
relevant in individuals with insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and T2DM, who may
have dysregulation of the PI3K pathway in breast cancer, as demonstrated in our mouse
model. In our model, we demonstrate that with pan class 1 PI3K inhibition, there is no
increase in activation of Erk1/2 signaling. Our data demonstrates a similar reduction in
tumor growth with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and PI3K inhibition alone. However, dual
inhibition of PI3K and mTOR importantly led to less severe hyperglycemia and
hyperinsulinemia, which may be due to either less potent inhibition of Akt by NVP-BEZ235
or due to a reduction in insulin resistance by inhibiting mTOR. Based on the results of our
study and other similar studies, many questions regarding the role of PI3K in tumor growth
and metabolism have emerged. Future studies are needed to address the roles of
hyperinsulinemia and diabetes in breast cancer mortality in women (Peairs 2010).

Understanding more about the specific p110 isoforms in tumor growth and metabolism is
necessary so that targeted therapy can lead to maximal tumor inhibition with minimal
adverse metabolic consequences. This is particularly important as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway may be an important target in hyperinsulinemic women with breast
cancer.

The mice used in this study were all on the FVB/N background. Wild type (WT) FVB/N
mice and MKR mice that have been characterized previously were used (Fernandez et al.
2001, Novosyadlyy 2010). The mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle, had free access to

Met-1 mammary tumor cells were initially derived from MMTV-PyVmT (FVB/N)
transgenic mice (Borowsky et al. 2005) and MCNeuA mammary tumor cells were derived
from MMTV-Neu (FVB/N) transgenic mice, the rodent equivalent of the human ERBB2
gene (Campbell et al. 2002). Cell culture, preparation and injection were performed as
described previously (Novosyadlyy et al. 2010; Fierz et al. 2010). Tumor cells were
inoculated into the 4th mammary fat pad of 8–10 week old female virgin homozygous MKR
and WT FVB/N mice. Two weeks after Met-1 cell inoculation, tumors were matched
according to size between groups, and mice were treated with either the pan-class I PI3K
inhibitor NVP-BKM120 (50 mg/kg body weight per day by oral gavage), dissolved in 1methyl-2-pyrrolidone NMP (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and PEG 300 (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) to a ratio of 10% NMP: 90% PEG300, or the vehicle (10%
NMP: 90% PEG 300). Similarly, treatment with the dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, NVPBEZ235 (40mg tosylate salt/kg body weight per day by oral gavage) dissolved in NMP and
mixed in PEG300 (10% NMP: 90% PEG300) or vehicle (10% NMP: 90% PEG300), began
2 weeks after Met-1 inoculation. Treatment continued in all groups for 14 days. Before and
during treatment, tumor growth was measured in three dimensions (cranio-caudal, transverse
and antero-posterior) using calipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula: 4/3 × π ×
r1 × r2 × r3 (r = radius). At the end of the study, mice were sacrificed and tumors were
removed and weighed. NVP-BKM120 and NVP-BEZ235 were obtained free of charge
through material transfer agreements with Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland).

IN, USA). Plasma insulin levels were measured by ELISA (Mercodia AB, Upsala, Sweden).
A glucose tolerance test was performed after 8 h of fasting using a glucose bolus of 1.5 g/kg
body weight administered by intraperitoneal injection. Blood glucose was measured from
the tail vein immediately before (Time 0) and 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after glucose
injection. Serum triglycerides were assayed by the triglycerides reagent set and
manufacturers specifications (Pointe Scientific, Canton, MI, USA).
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using the
ANOVA followed by a Fisher’s test. A p value of <0.05 was used to define statistical
significance.
