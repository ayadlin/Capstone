Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ponatinib is the only currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that suppresses all BCRABL1 single mutants in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, including the
recalcitrant BCR-ABL1T315I mutant. However, emergence of compound mutations in a BCRABL1 allele may confer ponatinib resistance. We found that clinically reported BCR-ABL1
compound mutants center on 12 key positions and confer varying resistance to imatinib, nilotinib,
dasatinib, ponatinib, rebastinib and bosutinib. T315I-inclusive compound mutants confer highlevel resistance to TKIs, including ponatinib. In vitro resistance profiling was predictive of
treatment outcomes in Ph+ leukemia patients. Structural explanations for compound mutationbased resistance were obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings
demonstrate that BCR-ABL1 compound mutants confer different levels of TKI resistance,
necessitating rational treatment selection to optimize clinical outcome.

Introduction
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 (Druker et al., 2006) have
dramatically improved the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and, to a lesser
extent, Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
However, TKI resistance occurs in 20-30% of CML patients (O'Hare et al., 2012) and is
commonly attributable to point mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain. The TKIs
approved for first-line therapy, imatinib (Apperley, 2007; Azam et al., 2003; Bradeen et al.,
2006), nilotinib (Weisberg et al., 2005), and dasatinib (Shah et al., 2004), and the second-

line therapy, bosutinib (Cortes et al., 2011; Redaelli et al., 2009), demonstrate overlapping
resistance profiles, with the BCR-ABL1T315I mutant a shared vulnerability (O'Hare et al.,
2012). Additionally, some patients fail therapy despite inhibition of BCR-ABL1, implicating
activation of alternative, BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent resistance mechanisms (Dai et al.,
2004; Donato et al., 2003; Hochhaus et al., 2002).
Ponatinib (O'Hare et al., 2009) is a high-affinity, pan-BCR-ABL1 TKI with the unique
property of inhibiting BCR-ABL1T315I. Antileukemic activity has been observed in clinical
trials of ponatinib, including patients with BCR-ABL1T315I, although responses in patients
with blastic phase CML (CML-BP) or Ph+ ALL are typically transient (Cortes et al., 2012;
Cortes et al., 2013). After a hold due to safety concerns pertaining to vascular occlusion
events, regulatory approval in the U.S. was reinstated for patients with refractory Ph+
leukemia harboring BCR-ABL1T315I or for whom no other TKI is indicated (Senior, 2014).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A risk of sequential TKI treatment is the selection of BCR-ABL1 compound mutants,
defined as harboring ≥2 mutations in the same BCR-ABL1 allele, that have the potential to
confer resistance to multiple TKIs (Shah et al., 2007). Vulnerability of ponatinib to certain
two-component compound mutations was demonstrated in pre-clinical studies (O'Hare et al.,
2009), suggesting they may emerge as a clinical problem in patients treated with ponatinib.
Importantly, ultra-deep sequencing of serial samples from Ph+ leukemia patients who had
received sequential TKI treatment showed that the majority (76%) of BCR-ABL1 compound
mutations were two-component mutations, as compared to 21% triple and 3% quadruple
mutations (Soverini et al., 2013). Progress in the development of a next generation
sequencing approach spanning the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain in a single read was recently
reported (Kastner et al., 2014).
The ability of available TKIs to address resistance due to clinically reported BCR-ABL1
compound mutants has yet to be investigated. In this study, we inventoried clinically
reported BCR-ABL1 compound mutations and established in vitro TKI sensitivity profiles
of BCR-ABL1 compound mutants against a panel of clinically available TKIs.

Results
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Key BCR-ABL1 Kinase Domain Positions are Frequently Represented in Clinically
Reported Compound Mutants
Over 100 BCR-ABL1 kinase domain point mutations have been linked with clinical
imatinib resistance (Apperley, 2007), and resistance profiles for newer BCR-ABL1 TKIs are
mainly comprised of subsets of these mutations. In the current study, all uses of the term
‘compound mutation’ refer to two-component compound mutations unless otherwise stated.
Thorough inventory of clinical BCR-ABL1 compound mutations associated with TKI
resistance reported in the published literature identified a limited list of 12 kinase domain
positions (Figure 1A) comprising the majority of compound mutations, which we refer to as
key positions. All clinically reported compound mutations (100%) in Figure 1 include a key
position, and the majority (65%) involve two (Figure 1B and 1C). Each position has been
implicated in resistance to one or more TKIs: imatinib (Bradeen et al., 2006; Gorre et al.,
2001), nilotinib (Bradeen et al., 2006; Ray et al., 2007; Weisberg et al., 2005), dasatinib

(Bradeen et al., 2006; Burgess et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2004), bosutinib (Redaelli et al.,
2009), ponatinib (O'Hare et al., 2009) and rebastinib (Chan et al., 2011; Eide et al., 2011).
The key residues in native BCR-ABL1 are: M244, G250, Q252, Y253, E255, V299, F311,
T315, F317, M351, F359, and H396 (Figure 1A). Clinical examples of T315I paired with all
key positions except 299 and 317 have been reported (Figures 1B and S1A). Among 66
possible pairings of the 12 key positions, 30 (46%) have been reported to date (Figures 1B,
1C and S1B). Further variations at the specific substitution level also occur, for example
T315I/F359C and T315I/F359V (Figure 1B) and E255K/F317L and E255V/F317I (Figure
1C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Relevance for these key positions in TKI resistance is further supported by baseline
conventional sequencing traces of 439 patients entering the phase 2 Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and
CML Evaluation (PACE) trial (Cortes et al., 2013). Enrollment required: 1) resistance to or
unacceptable toxicity from nilotinib or dasatinib or 2) a documented baseline T315I
mutation. Mutations occurring in more than 1 patient were confined to 16 positions,
including 11/12 key positions (all except Q252). In total, 95.4% (270/283) of the mutations
observed in >1 patient among baseline PACE specimens occurred at key positions. For
PACE end of treatment (EOT) specimens, 93.8% (15/16) of two-component compound
mutations inferred from conventional sequencing involved two key positions (Table S1).
Clinically Available TKIs Exhibit Differential Activity Against BCR-ABL1 Compound
Mutants
Proliferation assays comparing six TKIs were performed with Ba/F3 cells expressing native
BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1 single mutants at each of the 12 key positions, and clinically
reported BCR-ABL1 compound mutants (Khorashad et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010; Shah et
al., 2007; Stagno et al., 2008). Except for I315M (see below), each single mutant was
effectively inhibited by at least one TKI and exhibited an IC50 value below the average
steady-state plasma TKI concentration reported for patients receiving the standard drug dose
(Figure 2A). The six TKIs displayed partially overlapping resistance profiles for BCRABL1 single mutants, with T315I inhibited only by ponatinib and rebastinib.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

T315I-inclusive compound mutants were insensitive to all TKIs except ponatinib and
rebastinib, which exhibited only marginal efficacy in most cases (Figures 2B and 2C). The
most resistant mutant, E255V/T315I (IC50: 659.5 nM), exhibited 11.9- and 22.7-fold higher
ponatinib resistance than E255V (IC50: 55.6 nM) or T315I (IC50: 29.1 nM; Table S2),
respectively. The IC50 for E255V/T315I is >6.5-fold the average steady-state plasma
concentration (101 nM) for patients receiving ponatinib at the PACE starting dose (45 mg/
day; (Cortes et al., 2012)). The Q252H/T315I, T315I/M351T, T315I/F359V and T315I/
H396R mutants exhibited marginal ponatinib sensitivity (IC50: 84.8-114.3 nM) and highlevel rebastinib resistance (IC50: 464.6-955.3 nM). M244V/T315I was the only T315Iinclusive compound mutant in the panel predicted to be sensitive to ponatinib and rebastinib
at clinically achievable levels (Figure 2; Table S2). In vitro sensitivity of T315I-inclusive
mutants was correlated to the degree of BCR-ABL1 Y393 phosphorylation (a marker of
kinase activity) by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2D).

All non-T315I compound mutants analyzed were inhibited by one or more TKIs (Figure
2B). For some compound mutants (e.g.Y253H/F317L), several TKI options exist. For
others, a single TKI stands out as the leading choice, most notably dasatinib for Y253H/
E255V (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S2). Superiority of dasatinib compared to ponatinib
(which demonstrate similar low nanomolar IC50s against native BCR-ABL1) against this
particular compound mutant was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis, which revealed
substantial residual pBCR-ABL1 signal for ponatinib compared to dasatinib at 100 nM
(Figure 2E). All other non-T315I compound mutants were effectively suppressed by
ponatinib at concentrations below the steady-state plasma concentrations of 45 mg/day (101
nM), and 30 mg/day (84 nM) doses. In addition to Y253H/E255V, only E255V/V299L
(IC50: 42.8 nM) and F317L/F359V (IC50: 53.2 nM) were not inhibited at the steady-state
plasma concentration for the 15 mg/day (35 nM) dose. It is conceivable that ponatinib doses
lower than 15 mg/day may not be able to prevent the emergence of additional compound
mutants. In summary, non-T315I BCR-ABL1 compound mutants exhibited a spectrum of
TKI sensitivities, suggesting in vitro resistance profiles may serve as a guide for clinical TKI
selection.

Computational Modeling of Y253H/E255V Rationalizes Differential TKI Sensitivity

Ponatinib binds to the ABL1 kinase domain in the DFG-out mode, recognizing an inactive
conformation of the kinase (O'Hare et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2011). The binding site of
ponatinib is centered on the adenine pocket of the enzyme and extends from the phosphatebinding loop (P-loop) to the C-helix region. By contrast, dasatinib binding is accompanied
by fewer conformational constraints and is less dependent on direct P-loop and C-helix
interactions (Tokarski et al., 2006). Since ponatinib compared favorably with dasatinib
against all non-T315I compound mutants except Y253H/E255V, we investigated structural
features that account for the striking difference in the case of this compound mutant
(ponatinib IC50: 203.5 nM; dasatinib IC50: 18.1 nM; Table S2). Molecular dynamics
simulations were carried out for a protracted interval (100 ns), and docking simulations were
performed using the GlideXP method (Schrödinger, 2012) on a collection of 50 Y253H/
E255V conformations extracted at regular intervals. Introduction of Y253H and E255V
noticeably shifted the P-loop, impinging on the ponatinib binding site (Figure 3A). Loss of
Y253-F382 aromatic π-π stacking also pushed F382 into the ponatinib site (Figures 3B and
S2) and disruption of the critical K271-E286 salt bridge in the inactive conformation
repositioned residues L248, K271, E286, and R362 (Figure 3B and S2). In contrast,
modeling predicted that dasatinib forms a new hydrogen bond with H253 in the Y253H/
E255V mutant and that realignments relative to native BCR-ABL1 do not obstruct dasatinib
binding (Figure 3C and 3D). Thus, in vitro experimental results and computational modeling
(Figures 2B, 2C and 3E) identify dasatinib as the only TKI that retains potency against
Y253H/E255V at clinically relevant levels.
Conventional and Clonal Sequencing Establish Correlations Between Baseline Mutations
and Response to Ponatinib
To understand the role of compound mutations for ponatinib response and resistance, we
received and analyzed 100 specimens from 64 patients treated on the PACE trial (n=50) or
ponatinib expanded access program (n=14), using both conventional Sanger sequencing and

clonal sequencing of an average of 85 individual BCR-ABL1 kinase domain amplicons per
specimen. Clinical specimens originated from patients enrolled at centers participating in the
PACE trial that elected to participate in an investigator-initiated companion protocol. The
cloning and sequencing approach is an order of magnitude more sensitive and conclusively
differentiates compound from polyclonal mutations, allowing greater insight into the role of
compound mutations in TKI resistance. Pre-ponatinib baseline samples were evaluated for
all patients; for 30 patients, longitudinal and/or EOT specimens were also analyzed. Patients
were grouped according to baseline mutation status assessed by conventional sequencing: (i)
T315I, (ii) mutation other than T315I, or (iii) no mutation. Thirty-one patients were in the
chronic phase (CML-CP), 14 in the accelerated phase (CML-AP) and 19 in the blastic phase
of CML (CML-BP) or with Ph+ ALL. The cohort was heavily pretreated: 31 patients (48%)
had been exposed to 2 TKIs and 29 (45%) to 3 or more TKIs. Prior TKI exposure, baseline
mutation status, response and outcome are summarized in Table 1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Patients with a T315I baseline mutation—T315I was detected at baseline in 22/64
patients (34.4%), including 8 CML-CP, 6 CML-AP, 5 CML-BP and 3 Ph+ ALL patients
(Table S3). Three patients carried a second baseline mutation: K285E (#2), F317L (#10) or
H396R (#18).
Patients with a mutation other than T315I at baseline—Non-T315I baseline
mutations were found in 17/64patients (26.6%), representing all non-T315I key positions
except 244 and 311: 9 CML-CP, 3 CML-AP, 2 CML-BP and 3 Ph+ ALL (Table S4). Most
baseline samples (11/17; 64.7%) harbored a mutation at a single position; six had mutations
at two positions: F317L; E450G (#23), F317L; E459K (#27), E255V; F317L (#32), F317I;
F359V (#34), Y253H; E255V (#35) and G250E; F317L (#39).
Patients with no baseline BCR-ABL1 mutation—Lack of a baseline mutation was
observed in 25/64 patients (39.1%): 14 CML-CP, 5 CML-AP, 4 CML-BP and 2 Ph+ ALL
(Table S5). No patient lacking a baseline mutation who discontinued ponatinib harbored a
compound mutation at EOT, suggesting a degree of BCR-ABL1-independent resistance
prior to initiating ponatinib therapy as well as at ponatinib failure. In the following, we
evaluated outcomes on ponatinib therapy for patients carrying a baseline T315I or nonT315I mutation.

T315I-Inclusive Compound Mutations are Associated with Ponatinib Failure
Our in vitro profiling of T315-inclusive compound mutants predicts that most pairings with
a second key position will confer moderate- to high-level ponatinib resistance (Figure 2).
Accordingly, we observed three patients who discontinued ponatinib due to marked
expansion of a T315I-inclusive compound mutation. Patient #38 (Table S4 and S6)
presented with Ph+ ALL previously refractory to imatinib and dasatinib. Cloning and
sequencing (n=84 clones) confirmed a predominant E255V mutation (85% of clones),
including as an E255V/T315I compound mutation (17% of clones). Transient response to
ponatinib was followed by rapid hematologic relapse and a detection of a dominant E255V/
T315I compound mutation (69% of clones; Figure 4A). Molecular dynamics simulations
traced the reduced affinity of ponatinib toward E255V/T315I compared to T315I alone to re-

orientation of the P-loop and C-helix necessary to accommodate the hydrophobic V255 side
chain (Figure 4B). These adjustments force the L248 and I315 side chains into the ponatinib
site, repositioning residues M290, F359, and D381, and reducing the distance between F382
and I315, which narrows the channel into which ponatinib normally binds (Figures 4C and
S2).
A second patient (#36, CML-BP; Table S4) had a baseline F359C mutation and later
experienced disease progression attributable to a T315I/F359C mutation that was not
detectable in the baseline clonal sequencing profile (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S7). This
compound mutant was recovered in Ba/F3 BCR-ABLT315I cell-based resistance screens for
ponatinib (O'Hare et al., 2009) and rebastinib (Eide et al., 2011), in line with our in vitro
profiles implicating mutant pairing of these two positions in moderate and high-level
resistance to these TKIs, respectively.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Lastly, a CML-AP patient (#12; Tables S3 and S7) with a baseline T315I mutation treated
with ponatinib (45 mg/day) experienced disease progression with a T315I/E453K mutation
(90% of clones) not detected at baseline by conventional sequencing or cloning and
sequencing (Figure 5C). The E453K mutation has been reported in imatinib resistance
(Soverini et al., 2013) but not compound mutation-based resistance. Ba/F3 BCRABL1T315I/E453K cells showed a substantially higher level of ponatinib resistance (IC50:
93.4 nM) relative to those expressing the T315I mutant (Figure 5D) and were insensitive to
all other TKIs tested except rebastinib (IC50: 322.9 nM) (Figure 2B and 2C). Both ponatinib
and rebastinib were effective only at clinically unachievable concentrations (Figure 2B).
Among these three examples, the T315I-inclusive EOT mutation was also detectable at
baseline in only one case (E255V/T315I) and only by clonal sequencing, suggesting the
treatment failure-causing mutation was acquired on therapy or was below the detection limit
of cloning and sequencing in the other two cases.
Two additional patients in our study (#17 and #18; Tables S3 and S6) had ponatinib resistant
EOT mutations that already predominated at baseline (Y253H/T315I and T315I/H396R,
respectively; Figure S3). Altogether, these findings suggest that T315I-inclusive compound
mutations significantly impair ponatinib binding and typically lead to clinical resistance and
relapse.

The I315M Mutation Emanates from T315I and Confers High-Level Ponatinib Resistance
Nearly every instance of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation-based ponatinib failure was
attributable to a compound mutation pairing two key positions. However, in the case of a
Ph+ ALL patient (#22; Figure 6A; Tables S3 and S8) with a baseline T315I mutation who
achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) on ponatinib (45 mg/day) but progressed
after 7 months, longitudinal and EOT cloning and sequencing revealed a change of I315 to
methionine (I315M) through a single nucleotide change (ATT to ATG). We previously
recovered the ponatinib resistant I315M mutant in Ba/F3 BCR-ABL1T315I cell-based
resistance screens (Eide et al., 2011; O'Hare et al., 2009), and in vitro profiling of Ba/F3
BCR-ABL1I315M cells confirmed pan-TKI resistance. The level of ponatinib resistance
conferred by the I315M mutation (IC50: 577.5 nM; Figure 6B) exceeded all tested single and
compound mutants except E255V/T315I (IC50: 659.5 nM). Molecular dynamics simulations

demonstrated direct encroachment of the methionine residue on the ponatinib site (Figure
6C and 6D) and that adjustments at positions 269, 290, 317, 359 and 381 also disfavor
ponatinib binding (Figure 6D; Figure S2) and disrupt the hydrophobic spine architecture
(Azam et al., 2008). These findings illustrate that I315M as a single point mutation can lead
to ponatinib treatment failure.
Non-T315I Compound Mutations Impart Differential Levels of TKI Resistance
In vitro evaluation of non-T315I compound mutants showed varying levels of TKI
sensitivity across the panel, with 7/8 mutants demonstrating sensitivity to ponatinib (Figure
2C). Among patients for whom EOT samples were available, only one demonstrated clear
evidence of a non-T315I compound mutation at failure (#37, Ph+ ALL; Figure 7A; Tables
S4 and S9). Following treatment with imatinib and dasatinib, this patient exhibited a
baseline F317I mutation. The patient experienced disease progression and discontinued
ponatinib (45 mg/day), with EOT sequencing revealing an E255V/F317I mutation (100% of
clones; Figure 7A).

In contrast, three patients with non-T315I compound mutations at baseline achieved durable
responses on ponatinib. Patient #34 (Figure 7B; Tables S4 and S9) presented with CML-AP
and was treated with imatinib and dasatinib prior to starting ponatinib. Two mutations
(F317I and F359V) identified in the baseline sample were confirmed as a predominant
F317I/F359V compound mutation by cloning and sequencing (Figure 7B). The patient
achieved rapid complete hematologic response (CHR) and a major molecular response
(MMR) within 7 months on ponatinib, at which time the majority (87%) of sequenced
clones remained F317I/F359V. At last follow-up of 16 months, the patient continued to
maintain MMR.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Two additional patients (#23 and #27; Tables S4 and S9) with non-T315I compound
mutations predominant at baseline showed marked reduction in the abundance of the
compound-mutant clones on ponatinib therapy. After failing four successive TKIs, Patient
#23 exhibited an F317L/E450G baseline compound mutation (83% of clones; Figure 7C).
The patient achieved a CHR and stable disease on ponatinib for over 2 years, discontinuing
for undisclosed reasons. EOT sequencing showed no F317L/E450G (Figure 7C), suggesting
this mutant is resistant to previous TKIs but sensitive to ponatinib. Similarly, CML-CP
Patient #27 (Tables S4 and S9) exhibited an F317L/E459K baseline mutation (98% of
clones; Figure 7D) following failure of imatinib and dasatinib. After a year on ponatinib and
achievement of CHR but neither CCyR nor MMR, F317L/E459K was reduced to a minor
component (6% of clones), suggesting sensitivity to ponatinib. Compound mutants pairing
E459K with M244V, G250E, V299L (Kim et al., 2009) and T315I have been reported
(Figure 1B and 1C); the current study reports F317L/E459K as a confirmed clinical
compound mutation. In summary, T315I-inclusive compound mutations almost uniformly
confer high-level resistance to all clinically available TKIs including ponatinib, while a
fraction of non-T315I compound mutants remain sensitive to one or more TKIs.

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Drug resistant compound mutations within the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain are an emerging
clinical problem for patients receiving sequential TKI therapy. As we predicted for ponatinib
and rebastinib, some of these mutations confer resistance that is several-fold higher than that
of either contributing mutation in isolation (Eide et al., 2011; O'Hare et al., 2009). We
investigated the role of BCR-ABL1 compound mutations in TKI resistance, focusing on
ponatinib due to its unique effectiveness against the T315I single mutant and clinical
availability.
In the U.S., ponatinib is approved for patients with refractory CML or Ph+ ALL harboring a
T315I mutation or for whom no other TKI is indicated, based on results of the PACE trial
demonstrating significant activity at a median follow-up of 15 months (Cortes et al., 2013).
Despite the impressive efficacy of ponatinib, our findings indicate that compound mutations
are an important route of therapy escape, and it is conceivable that dose reduction from 45
mg to 30 mg/day, as recommended for patients with a good response to ponatinib, may
increase the emergence of drug resistant compound mutants.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our in vitro studies predict that a 30 mg/day dose would maintain efficacy against 7/8 nonT315I compound mutants tested in our panel. At a daily dose of 15 mg, ponatinib is
predicted to pre-empt outgrowth of 5/8 non-T315I compound mutants in our panel, with the
Y253H/E255V, E255V/V299L and F317L/F359V mutants remaining potentially
problematic. In contrast, therapeutic utility is less promising with respect to T315I-inclusive
compound mutants, where 9/10 in our panel showed little or no sensitivity to ponatinib or
any of the other TKIs tested. We provide examples of clinical ponatinib failure attributable
to E255V/T315I, T315I/F359C, Y253H/T315I, T315I/H396R, and T315I/E453K. Given the
unique efficacy of ponatinib against the T315I single mutant and its current revised U.S.
clinical indication, a significant fraction of future patients treated with ponatinib will be
expected to harbor a T315I mutation at baseline. More sensitive, routine screening of
baseline samples from these patients may be warranted to determine whether problematic
T315I-inclusive compound mutants are present.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Detection of two mutations by conventional sequencing does not provide sufficient
information to identify the best treatment option since this may represent two clones, each
with a single mutation. In contrast, cloning and sequencing readily discerns compound from
polyclonal mutations. For example, while Patients #10, #26, and #35 each had two baseline
mutations by conventional sequencing, cloning and sequencing demonstrated mutual
exclusivity of these mutations at the clonal level. Verification that Y253H and E255V exist
in different clones as opposed to as a highly ponatinib resistant Y253H/E255V compound
mutant (Patient #35) is of importance for clinical decision-making.
In our study, no patient beginning ponatinib with native BCR-ABL1 by conventional
sequencing exhibited a causative compound mutation at EOT, similar to reports on BCRABL1 single mutants (Khorashad et al., 2008; Soverini et al., 2009). These results suggest
that patients who failed multiple TKIs without a BCR-ABL1 mutation are unlikely to
experience ponatinib failure due to emergence of a resistance-conferring compound

mutation. Effective therapy for these patients may require a synthetic lethality approach
involving blockade of a second pathway in addition to BCR-ABL1. Additionally, consistent
with inferred compound mutational status data reported in the PACE trial (Cortes et al.,
2013), we found detection of compound mutations at EOT to be more frequent among
CML-BP and Ph+ ALL patients than those with CML-CP, suggesting an increased risk of
compound mutation-based ponatinib resistance in advanced disease. Although we identified
a number of resistance-conferring compound mutants at EOT, longer follow-up and a larger
number of specimens will be required to make definitive prognostic use of baseline
sequencing profiles of patients beginning a new TKI.

Among the 12 key positions identified, there appear to be pairing constraints for generation
of TKI resistant compound mutants. For example, the current snapshot of reported
compound mutations includes position 315 in compound with 9/11 other key positions,
whereas position 252 has only been reported in compound with positions 255 and 315. We
also observed that among the 66 possible pairwise combinations of the 12 key residues, the
spectrum and frequency of pairings reported to date appear to represent a non-random
distribution (χ2=42.39; dF=3; p<0.0001). While additional resistant pairings will
undoubtedly be observed in the future, findings to date may suggest that only a limited
number of compound mutation possibilities avoid deleterious, non-tolerated effects on
kinase function (Corbin et al., 2002) or fitness of the mutated clone (Griswold et al., 2006;
Shah et al., 2007; Skaggs et al., 2006) and are consistent with our observation that the
number of missense mutations tolerated by the kinase appears to be limited.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The broad potency of ponatinib against BCR-ABL1 point mutants can be traced to the
extensive network of contacts that stabilize its binding to the kinase domain. However,
certain pairings of mutations, each of which is susceptible to a given TKI in isolation, confer
increased resistance when present as a compound mutation. Molecular dynamics-guided
modeling performed for Y253H/E255V, E255V/T315I and I315M reveals commonalities
that could aid in designing TKIs to treat compound mutants. For instance, several compound
mutations involving the P-loop result in significant distortion of this region, suggesting it
may prove advantageous to minimize direct TKI/P-loop interactions. Also intriguing is our
characterization of an I315M point mutation in clinical resistance to ponatinib due to direct
encroachment of the mutant side chain on drug binding (Patient #22). Notably, ponatinib is a
poor inhibitor of kinases in which methionine is the native ‘gatekeeper’ position analogous
to BCR-ABL1 position 315. For example, the insulin receptor is ∼500 fold less sensitive to
ponatinib than ABL1T315I (O'Hare et al., 2009). By contrast, the T315A mutant is uniquely
resistant to dasatinib and inhibited by each of the other five TKIs including ponatinib
(Burgess et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2004). These findings argue that efforts to develop future
BCR-ABL1 TKIs should also consider the capacity to accommodate multiple different
specific substitutions at the gatekeeper position.
Computational methods have been applied to BCR-ABL1 single and compound mutants to
predict TKI binding, including ponatinib (Gibbons et al., 2014; Tanneeru and Guruprasad,
2013). The use of different computational methods and the inherent limitations of modeling
mandate experimental validation of predictions. For example, one computational approach
identified T315I/F359V as ∼4-fold more resistant to ponatinib than Y253H/T315I (Gibbons

et al., 2014). In contrast, our comprehensive, direct experimental comparison of compound
mutants and findings in cell-based resistance analyses (O'Hare et al., 2009) identify Y253H/
T315I as 3.5-fold more ponatinib resistant than T315I/F359V.
It is impossible to predict exactly how many patients diagnosed with CML or Ph+ ALL will
develop resistance due to BCR-ABL1 compound mutations. Fortunately, most CML-CP
patients treated with TKIs upfront achieve and maintain profound responses and are at a low
risk for acquiring compound mutations. In contrast, TKI failure remains common in CMLBP and Ph+ ALL, and the incidence of compound mutations may increase with the number
of successive TKI therapies (Shah et al., 2007). Although patients with compound mutations
represent only a minority of Ph+ leukemias, they currently lack a targeted therapy option and
their prognosis is poor (Cortes et al., 2013), highlighting the need to identify therapeutic
strategies that minimize mutational escape in Ph+ leukemia. In addition, our findings are
relevant to other cancers in which compound mutations are a predicted mechanism of
therapy escape, including AML (Smith et al., 2013) and NSCLC (Awad et al., 2013; Davare
et al., 2013). Development of therapeutic strategies to control and target compound
mutation-based resistance in Ph+ leukemia will also provide a blueprint for similar discovery
in other cancers.

Experimental Procedures
Inhibitors
Inhibitors were prepared as 10.0 mM stock solutions in phosphate-buffered saline (imatinib)
or DMSO and stored at -20 °C. Serial dilutions of stock solutions were carried out before
each experiment.
Cellular Proliferation Assays
Ba/F3 BCR-ABL1-expressing cells were plated in 96-well plates (2×103 cells/well) and
incubated in 2-fold escalating concentrations of dasatinib, ponatinib (0-768 nM), imatinib,
nilotinib, rebastinib, or bosutinib (0-10240 nM) for 72 h. Proliferation was assessed by
methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-based viability assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous One; Promega).
IC50 values are reported as the mean of three independent experiments performed in
quadruplicate. See also: Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Isolation of Primary Ph+ Leukemia Cells from Blood or Bone Marrow
All patients were consented in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont
Report, and University of Utah Institutional Review Board approved all studies with human
specimens. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from primary patient peripheral blood
or bone marrow specimens by Ficollseparation. CD34+ cells were enriched by magnetic
column separation using a CD34 human microbead kit and the POSSELDS program
(AutoMACS; Miltenyi). Purity of the CD34+ fraction was determined to be >90% by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting. If MNC yield was limiting (<2e7 cells), the RNA
isolation described below was done with an aliquot of MNCs. See also: Supplemental

Conventional and Clonal Sequencing of the BCR-ABL1 Kinase Domain

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA obtained from primary Ph+ leukemia cell lysates (QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit) served
as template for cDNA synthesis (BioRad iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit) as recommended by
the manufacturer. Amplification of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain was done by two-step
PCR to exclude amplification of normal ABL1 (Khorashad et al., 2006). PCR products were
electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel to confirm amplification, purified (QIAquick PCR
Purification Kit; QIAGEN) and subjected to 1) conventional Sanger sequencing in both
directions using BigDye terminator chemistry on an ABI3730 instrument (Khorashad et al.,
2006), and 2) cloning and sequencing of amplified fragments introduced into E. coli TOP10
cells (TOPO cloning system; Invitrogen) (Khorashad et al., 2013). For cloning and
sequencing, individual bacterial colonies (average: 85/specimen; range: 23-100), each
carrying a recombinant plasmid with a single BCR-ABL1 kinase domain amplicon inserted,
were subjected to BCR-ABL1 kinase domain amplification and Sanger sequenced in both
directions (Beckman Coulter Genomics). DNA sequence analysis was done with Mutation
Surveyor software (SoftGenetics) (O'Hare et al., 2009).
Immunoblot Analysis of BCR-ABL1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ba/F3 cells expressing native or compound mutant BCR-ABL1 were cultured for 4 hr in
standard medium alone or with escalating concentrations of TKI, followed by boiling for 10
min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Lysates were separated on 4-15% Tris-glycine gels,
transferred, and immunoblotted with antibodies for the BCR N-terminus (3902; Cell
Signaling) and phospho-ABL1 (Y393 [1a numbering]; Cell Signaling).
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Mutant conformations of the ABL1 kinase were prepared using standard methods to
generate ABL1Y253H/E255V, ABL1E255V/T315I, and ABL1I315M. For each mutant, both the
active (PDB entry 2GQG (Tokarski et al., 2006)) and inactive (PDB entry 2HYY (Manley et
al., 2005)) conformations of ABL1 kinase were created. The NAMD simulation package
was used for molecular dynamics simulation, and the Amber ff12SB force field was
employed for standard protein parameters. See also: Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Docking Simulations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Schrödinger suite of programs (Suite 2012: Maestro, version 9.3) was used for docking
studies. In the final 50 ns of the simulation, 50 conformations were extracted as docking
receptors. Selected conformations were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard. Ligands
(ponatinib and dasatinib) were prepared (Suite 2012: LigPrep, version 2.5) and initial
docking simulation was performed using the GlideXP module (version 5.7) of the
Schrödinger program. To enhance binding conformations and allow receptor flexibility,
docked conformations were subjected to induced fit simulations. Docking scores were
computed using the GlideXP module. See also: Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Highlights

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BCR-ABL1 compound mutations can lead to clinical failures of ponatinib and other
TKIs
Nearly all non-T315I compound mutants are sensitive to at least one approved TKI
T315I-inclusive compound mutants confer resistance to all TKIs, including
ponatinib
Structural modeling provides a basis for design of TKIs targeting compound mutants

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In patients with Ph+ leukemia, control of TKI resistance due to BCR-ABL1 single
mutants is now achievable, but the ability of clinically available TKIs to target BCRABL1 compound mutants has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Results from this study
reveal that BCR-ABL1 compound mutations impart various levels of TKI resistance,
underscoring the need for definitive sequencing screens to distinguish these from
polyclonal mutations and suggesting that optimal therapy selection for patients harboring
compound mutations will improve disease control in Ph+ leukemia. These findings may
also apply to other malignancies in which compound mutations are a predicted route of
therapy escape, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).

Figure 3. Molecular Dynamics Simulations of ABL1Y253H/E255V Provide a Structural
Explanation for the Ineffectiveness of Ponatinib Compared to Dasatinib

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) Structural alignment of native ABL1 kinase (PDB entry 3IK3 bound to ponatinib;
orange) with the ABL1Y253H/E255V mutant kinase (blue). Ponatinib is shown in wireframe.
Positions within 4 Å of ponatinib were designated for structural alignment using only the Cα
atoms. Native positions Y253 and E255 (green) and mutated positions H253 and V255 (red)
are shown as spheres. The region of the backbone (P-loop, C-helix and DFG loop) that
showed major conformational change is highlighted in either orange (native) or blue
(Y253H/E255V). (B) Positions of selected residues in the ponatinib site of native ABL1
(orange) and ABL1Y253H/E255V (cyan). (C) Dasatinib was docked to a representative model
of the ABL1Y253H/E255V mutant structure using MD simulation. Key residues involved in
binding of dasatinib are shown (cyan). The Y253H substitution establishes a new hydrogen
bond with dasatinib, in addition to the existing T315-dasatinib hydrogen bond (red dashed
lines). The chemical structure of dasatinib is shown using a space-filling wireframe
representation. (D) Computational docking of dasatinib (black) and ponatinib (gray) into the
mutant ABL1Y253H/E255V kinase domain (Glide XP; Schrödinger, 2012). (E) Fold-change in
cellular IC50 for BCR-ABL1Y253H/E255V relative to native BCR-ABL1 for dasatinib (black)
and ponatinib (gray). Error bars represent +/- SEM. See also Figure S2.
