ABSTRACT
Alopecia is a dermatological condition with limited therapeutic options. Only
two drugs, finasteride and minoxidil, are approved by FDA for alopecia treatment.
However, little is known about the differences in adverse effects between these two
drugs. We examined the clinical reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) from 2004 to 2014. For both female and males, finasteride was found
to be more associated with reproductive toxicity as compared to minoxidil. Among
male alopecia cases, finasteride was significantly more concurrent with several forms
of sexual dysfunction. Among female alopecia cases, finasteride was significantly
more concurrent with harm to fetus and disorder of uterus. In addition, drug-gene
network analysis indicated that finasteride could profoundly disturb pathways related
to sex hormone signaling and oocyte maturation. These findings could provide clues
for subsequent toxicological research. Taken together, this analysis suggested that
finasteride could be more liable to various reproductive adverse effects. Some of these
adverse effects have yet to be warned in FDA-approved drug label. This information
can help improve the treatment regimen of alopecia and post-marketing regulation
of drug products.

INTRODUCTION

minoxidil are the only two drugs approved by Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for alopecia treatment.
Finasteride oral tablet is approved for the treatment of
benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness.
As a 5α-reductase inhibitor, finasteride can prevent the
conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thus
reducing androgen activity in the scalp [8]. Minoxidil
is originally designed as an antihypertensive drug. Ever
since hair regrowth is found as a side effect of treatment
for hypertension, minoxidil has been broadly used for
the topical treatment of alopecia. Many mechanisms of
action have been proposed to explain the regrowth effect
of minoxidil, including stimulation of blood flow in scalps
[9], development of dermal papilla vascularization [10],
enhanced hair follicular cycles [11] and potassium channel
conductance [12]. Finasteride and minoxidil are effective
in only a proportion of alopecia cases. But long after their
discovery, there are still no new FDA-approved remedies.
Since finasteride and minoxidil are the two major
treatments for alopecia, it is naturally a compelling issue
to understand their clinical differences in both efficacy

Alopecia refers to the unwanted loss of hair from
the head or body, which affects both men and women [1].
Rather than physiological injury, the predominant impact
of alopecia is psychological stress caused by the change
in appearance. Psychological problems in some cases
can deteriorate till the onset of severe symptoms [2].
Therefore, many affected subjects have strong willing to
arrest progression of hair loss and stimulate hair growth,
thus motivating basic research and drug development
related to alopecia. The etiologies of alopecia are still
largely unknown, but a series of hypotheses has been
proposed to explain the causes [3]. Alopecia areata is
considered an autoimmune disease, in which the immune
system mistakenly attacks hair follicles [4]. Androgenic
alopecia (a.k.a. male pattern baldness) may be a result of
hair follicles miniaturization [5, 6] and microinflammation
[7].
As a result of complicated etiologies, there are
very limited therapeutic options so far. Finasteride and

and risks. In addition, it is essential for regulators,
clinicians and consumers to understand the drug effects
in men and women, respectively [13, 14]. The differences
in therapeutic effect between these two drugs were
found to be sex-dependent. For male cases, a series
of comparative studies suggested a better efficacy of
finasteride [15-17]. In contrast, for female cases, several
clinical studies suggested that finasteride was generally
ineffective [18-20], while the efficacy of minoxidil was
repeatedly reported [21, 22]. On the other hand, however,
the toxicological differences between finasteride and
minoxidil were rarely addressed in previous studies, which
was partially due to the difficulty in collecting clinical data
about adverse effects from alopecia cases [23].
The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
is a computerized information database established by
U.S. Government, which restores reports of adverse
events spontaneously submitted by patients and healthcare
professionals. Ever since 2004, the continuous operation
of FAERS has achieved an enormous data collection, so
as to support FDA’s post-marketing safety surveillance
for approved drug products. Once a pharmacovigilance
signal was detected, a more rigorous investigation could
be conducted. In the meantime, FAERS also promoted
clinical studies worldwide [24] and lead to a series of
publications regarding various drugs and adverse effects
[25-27]. Because of the increasingly broad application
of FAERS data, the openFDA initiative was officially
launched in June 2014, which provided an official
application programming interface (API) to access the raw
data of adverse event reports in a structured format.
In the present study, we were enabled by openFDA
to retrieve adverse events reported to FAERS by alopecia
cases. By comparing the adverse events of finasteride
and minoxidil, we identified a series of common adverse
reactions that were significantly more concurrent with
one drug than the other. In particular, many of these
adverse reactions were directly related to female or male
reproductive system. The differences in reproductive
toxicology between alopecia drugs reiterated the
precautions of clinical drug use and warranted subsequent
research on the underlying toxicological mechanisms.

The gender composition of case reports
We primarily examined the gender composition of
alopecia cases. The numbers of reports for both female
and male cases were counted (Table 1), while the reports
without gender information were excluded for analysis
(see Methods). Adverse events of male patients accounted
for only 38.3% of the total FAERS reports. But among
alopecia cases, the reports of male cases comprised a
significantly higher proportion. Nearly half of minoxidil
related reports (i.e., 48.2%) and most finasteride related
reports (i.e., 97.2%) were submitted by male cases. Such
an highly biased gender composition of finasteride related
reports should be attributed to the fact that finasteride was
approved for alopecia in men only [28].
Then, we scrutinized the top 10 most commonly
reported adverse events among female and male alopecia
cases exposed to either finasteride or minoxidil (Table
2). It appeared that female and male cases were prone to
different adverse effects. In addition, a number of adverse
effects were directly related to reproductive system,
such as ‘abortion induced’ among females and ‘erectile
dysfunction’ among males. Then, we compared the
reports of finasteride and minoxidil, so as to find whether
certain adverse effects were significantly more associated
with one drug than the other. Due to the intrinsic gender
difference in physiology, we analyzed the data of female
and male cases separately.

The adverse events among male cases
Estimating safety risk from spontaneous reports is
not straightforward, since the number of reported events
is correlated to the total number of patients taking the
drug. For example, if a blockbuster drug is used by a large
number of patients, the number of adverse events of that
drug may naturally be relatively large. For that reason, we
calculated the proportion of a certain adverse effect in the

total reports of a drug, in order to normalize the difference
in the amount of usage between individual drugs. Thus,
the proportion value of finasteride was compared to that
of minoxidil, which lead to the proportional reporting
ratio (PRR) [29], along with 95% confidence interval
(CI) and significance level (see Methods). As a qualitative
indicator, PRR showed which drug was more concurrent
with a certain adverse effect.
Among male cases, finasteride was found to be
more frequently reported for reproductive adverse effects
(Table 3). For instance, ‘erectile dysfunction’ was reported
by 50.39% of the cases receiving finasteride treatment,
while this proportion for minoxidil was only 4.35%. A
PRR of 11.59 (95 CI: 4.44 - 30.25) indicated a significant
difference between these two drugs (P = 8.31×10-12).
Likewise, ‘ejaculation disorder’ (PRR = 7.67; P = 0.013),
‘libido decreased’ (PRR = 21.98; P = 1.02×10-7), ‘loss
of libido’ (PRR = 13.52; P = 8.22×10-5), ‘semen volume
decreased’ (PRR = 8.51; P = 5.78×10-3) and ‘sexual
dysfunction’ (not reported for minoxidil; P = 2.54×10-15)
were also more concurrent with finasteride as compared to
minoxidil. These results suggested that finasteride should
be used by males with more caution.
In addition to reproductive toxicity, some
psychiatric reactions were not emphasized in FDAapproved drug label [28] but frequently reported by
cases exposed to finasteride, including ‘anxiety’ (PRR
= 29.74; P = 4.17×10-10), ‘depression’ (PRR = 10.74; P
= 5.55×10-9) and ‘cognitive disorder’ (not reported for
minoxidil; P = 1.75×10-10). Only a few adverse effects
were apparently more reported by minoxidil users, such
as ‘dermatitis contact’ (PRR = 0.06; P = 1.58×10-5) and
‘chorioretinopathy’ (PRR = 0.02; P = 5.39×10-7). These
adverse effects should also be taken into consideration in
selecting the appropriate treatment.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

On the other hand, we also examined the adverse
effects among female cases. Even though finasteride has
not been officially approved for use by women, a number
of female cases exposed to finasteride were still found
in FAERS data. Compared with minoxidil, finasteride
exhibited significantly negative effect on female
reproductive system (Table 4). Fetal toxicity, characterized
by ‘abortion induced’ (PRR = 9.07; P = 1.93×10-3),
‘abortion spontaneous’ (PRR = 6.60; P = 0.016) and
‘paternal drugs affecting fetus’ (not reported for minoxidil;
P = 8.89×10-3), was more concurrent with finasteride than
minoxidil. Moreover, finasteride may affect uterus, leading
to more reports of ‘uterine cervix stenosis’ (not reported
for minoxidil; P = 0.022) and ‘endometrial hypertrophy’
(not reported for minoxidil; P = 0.022). These results
revealed the safety risks of unapproved use of finasteride
in female cases, especially in pregnant women. In contrast,
minoxidil-biased risk was not widely detected. ‘Swelling
face’, as a relatively minor safety concern, was the only
adverse effect significantly more reported by female cases
exposed to minoxidil (not reported for finasteride; P =
0.027).

Drug-gene network and functional enrichment
analysis
The aim of this study was not only to identify the
relative higher risk of finasteride, but more importantly,
to better understand how finasteride interfered with the
normal function of reproductive system. Almost all drugs
act through the interactions with numerous proteins in
human body encoded by different genes. In recent years,

the integrated analysis of drug-gene interactions has
provided many applications in toxicological research
[30]. To extend our knowledge of reproductive toxicity,
we constructed a drug-gene network [31] and explored
a number of genes directly or indirectly interrupted by
finasteride (see Materials and Methods). First, we searched
the PharmGKB database (https://www.pharmgkb.org/)
and the DrugBank database (http://www.drugbank.ca/)
to extract the finasteride-associated genes (FAGs) with
known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidences.
Then, the FAGs were overlaid into the context of human
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to recruit their neighbor
proteins, whose encoding genes were defiend as indirectly
associated genes (IAGs) of finasteride. At last, all FAGs
and IAGs were integrated into a network with 260 nodes
(259 genes and 1 drug) and 262 edges, which characterized
the toxicology of finasteride (Figure 1A). It is common
knowledge that the topology of true biological networks
is obviously different from that of random networks. The
topological coefficients (Figure 1B) and betweenness
centrality (Figure 1C) of the finasteride-centered network
approximately followed power law distributions [32]. This

biosynthesis’ pathway (P = 7.16×10-9), ‘intracellular
steroid hormone receptor signaling pathway’ (P =
1.24×10-47) and ‘androgen receptor signaling pathway’
(P = 2.00×10-44). These findings make very important
sense, since steroid hormones, specially androgen, are
well known to play an fundamental role in maintaining
male sexual function [34, 35]. Regarding reproductive
toxicity in women, we identified two KEGG pathways
that were highly enriched with FAGs and IAGs, including
‘oocyte meiosis’ (P = 1.43×10-5) and ‘progesteronemediated oocyte maturation’ (P = 3.27×10-5). Inadequate
secretion of progesterone has been proposed as a cause
of spontaneous abortion [36, 37]. These results indicated
that finasteride could profoundly affect the normal
reproductive function by acting on specific key genes in
relevant pathways.

dermatitis and chorioretinopathy. These results were
consistent with previous clinical observation [41-43] and
warranted in-depth toxicologically research.
In the meantime, reproductive toxicity of finasteride
was also reported by female alopecia cases. In the FDAapproved drug label, it has been warned that finasteride
may cause birth defects in fetus [28]. Our analysis
showed that besides birth defects, drug-induced abortion
and disorder of uterus were also significantly associated
with finasteride. Although finasteride was approved for
alopecia in men only, the female cases in FAERS revealed
that finasteride may also be used by women under some
circumstances. Usually, the negative cosmetic effect
of hair loss may cause greater psychological stress in
women than in men. As alopecia is becoming a clinical
problem increasingly common in women [44], some
female alopecia cases may have strong willing try every
possible remedy, even the effect of finasteride on women
remains largely unclear. This observation reminded us that
more attention should be paid to unapproved treatment
of alopecia. And subsequent research will be required to
elucidate how finasteride may affect female reproductive
system.
Accumulated researches have demonstrated
that an integrative analysis of drug-gene network can
provide deep insights into the molecular toxicological
mechanisms of drugs. Therefore, we extracted and linked
a set of human genes directly or indirectly interrupted
by finasteride. The topology characteristics showed that
the finasteride-centered network were scale-free just
as true biological networks. In this network, we found
that finasteride was closely related to androgen receptor
(gene symbol AR) and several other genes, thus disturb
a network significantly associated with a number of
functional annotations (e.g., sex hormone signaling and
oocyte maturation). These functional evidences, from the
network aspect, can illustrate the toxic effect of finasteride
on male and female reproductive systems, thus providing
objectives for follow-up research.
Despite of valuable discoveries, some inherent
limitations of FAERS data should be borne in mind. First,
the number of a certain adverse effect may not directly
measure the risk of drug in reality, since spontaneous
reporting may not represent the completeness of case
finding [45]. Moreover, even if reporting is complete, it
is hardly possible to enumerate the underlying population
of drugs users as the denominator. Therefore, the
proportional reporting ratio that resembled a risk ratio
in its distribution and interpretation was calculated as
an alternative measure. Regarding the adverse reaction
of interest, the reporting rate of finasteride users was
compared to the rate of minoxidil users. In this way,
the difference between these two drugs could be
qualitatively detected. But the reliability of PRRs may
still be jeopardized by confounding factors such as age,
comorbidities, and prior treatment history. Second, it has

DISCUSSION
Most alopecia cases with the intent of receiving
treatment may choose either finasteride or minoxidil,
since they are the two major drug products approved by
FDA for marketing. Therefore, the differences between
these two drugs are always a compelling clinical issue. In
previous studies, a lot of efforts have been made to unveil
their difference in efficacy. However, not only efficacy
but also toxicity of drugs should be fully understood to
determine the remedy with optimal benefit-to-risk ratio
[38]. Clinical trials with only a limited number of patients
and a relatively short period of treatment may not give the
full picture of safety risks, which need to be supplemented
by large-scale post-marketing data collected from general
population. As an excellent example of post-marketing
data source, OpenFDA platform provided formatted and
annotated information about drug generic names, patient
characteristics and adverse reactions. Such information
enabled us to efficiently explore the adverse events related
to finasteride and minoxidil. For both genders, finasteride
was concurrent with reproductive adverse effects more
often than minoxidil, which reiterated the importance of
studying undesirable drug effects on reproductive system
[39]. And the toxicological differences between finasteride
and minoxidil should be seriously considered when
selecting treatment regimen.
Among male cases, a relatively higher risk of sexual
dysfunction was observed with exposure to finasteride,
which corroborated the information in FDA-approved
drug label [28] and the results of previous controlled trials
[40]. These andrological adverse effects may be closely
related to the pharmacological mechanisms of finasteride.
As a drug originally developed for benign prostatic
hyperplasia, finasteride could influence androgen activity,
which may profoundly affect sexual function of men.
Apart from reproductive toxicity in men, we also found
that finasteride was more likely to induce psychiatric
reactions, and minoxidil was more likely to induce

been reported that finasteride and minoxidil were used
in combination in some cases [16, 46]. Nevertheless, the
number of adverse event reports concurrent with both
finasteride and minoxidil was too low in FAERS data
to achieve an acceptable statistical power. Therefore,
we would suggest that other clinical data regarding the
combined treatment of finasteride and minoxidil should
be scrutinized to better address the safety issue of drug
combination. Third, the close association between high
drug dose and incidence of adverse drug reaction has been
demonstrated by prior studies [47]. However, dosage
information was not analyzed in the present study, because
it was not clearly recorded in most FAERS reports. So we
would expect the dosage factor in toxicity to be examined
in other clinical data of alopecia cases. Fourth, the analysis
on drug-gene interactions led to a finasteride-centered
network, which provided new clues with regard to the
reproductive toxicity of finasteride. The next step should
involve carefully selecting specific candidate genes from
the network for in-depth research, such as drug-induced
differential gene expression [48] and mitochondrial DNA
damage [49].
All above concerns reminded us that the current
results are only the beginning, rather than a complete
conclusion, of the toxicological research about alopecia
treatments. First of all, while interpreting the P-values and
PRRs judiciously, further large-scale cohort studies will
be required to quantitatively confirm the incidence rate of
various adverse effects of finasteride or minoxidil. Also,
follow-up experimental research could be performed on
the basis of our analysis, so as to better understand the
reproductive toxicity of finasteride. For instance, it has
been well known that drug could induce adverse reactions
by unexpectedly interacting with off-target proteins and
perturbing downstream signaling pathways. Therefore,
the off-targets [50, 51] and genomic expression changes
[52, 53] related to finasteride could be further explored.
Moreover, it should be noticed that finasteride was
approved by FDA for oral use, while minoxidil was
approved for topical use. Previous research indicated that
the route of administration could greatly influence the
degree of toxicity, and oral administration was usually
more risky than external use [54]. Because of that, it is
worth trying to change the route of administration [55] or
adjust the oral dosage [56] of finasteride, so as to reduce
the toxic effects.
Taken together, our analysis on FAERS data
provided a unique perspective on the toxicological
differences between finasteride and minoxidil. In
particular, finasteride was more reported for reproductive
adverse effects among both women and men, some of
which have yet to be warned in FDA-approved drug label.
These findings should be considered to effectively improve
alopecia treatment and post-marketing regulation of drug
products. In addition, the present study will foster further
clinical and experimental research on the underlying

mechanisms of drug-induced reproductive toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Query of FAERS data
The original reports restored in FAERS were
queried from OpenFDA platform following the official
tutorial (https://open.fda.gov/api/reference/). The events
related to either finasteride or minoxidil, and submitted
from January 2004 to June 2014 were retrieved. Since
both finasteride and minoxidil have indication other than
alopecia, the adverse events were included only if the
drug indication was annotated with either of the following
OpenFDA query terms: “ALOPECIA”, “ALOPECIA
AREATA”, “ALOPECIA EFFLUVIUM”, “ALOPECIA
SCARRING”, “ALOPECIA TOTALIS”, “ALOPECIA
UNIVERSALIS”, “ANDROGENETIC ALOPECIA”,
“DIFFUSE ALOPECIA”, which were coded using
MedDRA terminology (http://www.meddra.org/). Taking
gender difference in to consideration, the adverse events
occurred among female and male cases were queried
and analyzed separately. Those reports without clear
information of patient’s gender were not included in this
analysis.

Proportional reporting ratio (PRR)
The top 10 most commonly reported adverse
events among finasteride users or by minoxidil users
were examined. To compare the risk of finasteride and
minoxidil, the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was
calculated. Consider a hypothetical situation in which
adverse effect X was reported by A1 alopecia cases among
all the A0 cases exposed to finasteride. On the other hand,
the same adverse effect was reported by B1 cases among
all the B0 cases exposed to minoxidil. Therefore, The PRR
for adverse effect X should be computed as follows:
The null hypothesis was formulated as PRRX = 1,
suggesting that adverse effect X was not more frequently
concurrent with one drug than the other. The P-value was
calculated with two-tailed Fisher’s exact test to determine
whether the null hypothesis was valid. And the 95%
confidence interval (CI) of PRR was calculated as

A PRR significantly greater than its null value of
1 indicated a finasteride-biased risk of adverse effect X.
Otherwise, a PRR significantly lower than 1 indicated a

Analysis of drug-gene network
A drug-gene network was generated with three
types of nodes, including drug (i.e., finasteride), drugassociated gene, and neighbor proteins interacting with
drug-associated genes. First, finasteride was queried in the
PharmGKB database (https://www.pharmgkb.org/) [57]
and the DrugBank database [58] to extract drug-associated
genes according to various published evidences. Then, the
proteins interacting with the above drug-associated genes
were extracted from the BioGRID database (version
3.4.138, http://thebiogrid.org/) [59]. Finally, nodes
interacting with each other were linked with an edge to
construct a network. The visualization and topological
analysis of this drug-gene network was deployed with
the Cytoscape software (version 3.4.0, http://www.
cytoscape.org/) [60]. All genes in this network were
input into the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit
(WebGestalt, http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/)
[61]. Hypergeometric test was performed to evaluate the
statistical significance of enrichment for KEGG pathways
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) [62] and
Gene Ontology terms (http://geneontology.org/) [63]. The
raw P-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
