Summary
Protein machines are multi-subunit protein complexes that orchestrate highly regulated
biochemical tasks. An example is the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), a
thirteen-subunit ubiquitin ligase that initiates the metaphase-anaphase transition and mitotic exit
by targeting proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 for ubiquitin-dependent destruction by the
proteasome1,2. Because blocking mitotic exit is an effective approach for inducing tumor cell
death3,4, the APC/C represents a potential novel target for cancer therapy. APC/C activation in
mitosis requires binding of Cdc205, which forms a co-receptor with the APC/C to recognize
substrates containing a Destruction box (D-box)6-14. Here we demonstrate that we can
synergistically inhibit APC/C-dependent proteolysis and mitotic exit by simultaneously disrupting
two protein-protein interactions within the APC/C-Cdc20-substrate ternary complex. We
identified a small molecule, called apcin (APC inhibitor), which binds to Cdc20 and competitively

inhibits the ubiquitylation of D-box-containing substrates. Analysis of the crystal structure of the
apcin-Cdc20 complex suggests that apcin occupies the D-box-binding pocket on the side face of
the WD40-domain. The ability of apcin to block mitotic exit is synergistically amplified by coaddition of tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME), a small molecule that blocks the APC/C-Cdc20
interaction15,16. This work suggests that simultaneous disruption of multiple, weak protein-protein
interactions is an effective approach for inactivating a protein machine.

We identified apcin (Fig. 1a) in an earlier study as an inhibitor of cyclin proteolysis in
mitotic Xenopus egg extract17, but its mechanism of action remained unknown. Analysis of
the structure-activity relationship (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a) revealed that
elimination of one nitrogen in the pyrimidine ring of apcin (apcin-P) reduced activity
slightly, but replacement with a morpholino group (apcin-M) eliminated activity. In contrast,
elimination of the nitro-imidazole moiety (apcin-A) had little effect. To identify the target of
apcin, we coupled apcin-A to beads via its amino group, incubated the beads with mitotic
Xenopus extract, and then removed the beads. We found that Cdc20 was depleted from the
extract (Fig. 1c), resulting in stabilization of a cyclin B-luciferase reporter protein (Fig. 1d).
Cyclin degradation was rescued by adding in vitro-translated Cdc20 (Fig. 1d), implicating
Cdc20 as the target of apcin. Cdc20 interacted with apcin-A beads in a manner that could be
competed by free apcin (Fig. 1e), but not by the inactive analog apcin-M or the APC/C
inhibitor TAME15,16 (Extended Data Fig. 1b). A cyclin B1 N-terminal fragment (cycB1NT) also competed for Cdc20 binding to the apcin-A resin, but the same fragment with a
mutated D-box did not (Fig. 1f). Among a panel of WD40-containing proteins, Cdc20
binding to apcin-A beads was most robust, followed by Cdh1, with much less binding of
other WD40-containing proteins observed (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although we have not
tested the ability of apcin to inhibit Cdh1-dependent ubiquitylation, apcin inhibited Cdh1dependent proteolysis in interphase Xenopus extract less efficiently than Cdc20-dependent
proteolysis in mitotic Xenopus extract (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Apcin bound to endogenous
Cdc20 in Xenopus extract in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 1e) that
correlated with its ability to inhibit formation of high-molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates
of cycB1-NT (Fig. 1g) or full-length cyclin B1 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Kinetic analysis of
a reconstituted APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation reaction16 showed that apcin caused a
significant increase (P=0.0039) in Km (Ki=23 μM) but no reduction in kcat (Extended Data
Fig. 2b). Together these results suggest that apcin competitively inhibits APC/C-dependent
ubiquitylation by binding to Cdc20 and preventing substrate recognition.
To identify the site on Cdc20 that binds apcin, we soaked apcin into Cdc20 protein crystals
and determined the structure of the Cdc20-apcin complex to 2.1Å resolution (Extended Data
Table 1). We found that apcin bound a small pocket on the side of the WD40 domain that
has been implicated in binding the D-box (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b)14,18,19.
The binding mode of acpin is consistent with the structure-activity relationship, as the
pyrimidine ring and aminal nitrogens make hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms from
D177. The hydrophobic trichloromethyl group is buried in the pocket occupied by leucine of
the D-box (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The nitro-imidazole moiety is positioned facing solvent,
explaining why apcin-A retains activity and can be used to isolate Cdc20 when coupled to
beads.

We tested whether mutations in the presumptive binding site affect the binding of Cdc20 to
apcin-A beads (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). V200 is located at the base of the
hydrophobic pocket and mutation to methionine blocked binding of Cdc20 and inactivated
the ability of Cdc20 to rescue cyclin degradation in a Cdc20-depleted extract. Mutation of
D177, P179 or I216, which line the binding pocket, also reduced binding to apcin and
function of Cdc20. Mutation of R174, which lies near the pyrimidine ring of apcin, also
reduced apcin binding and blocked Cdc20 rescue activity, consistent with a role of this
residue in interacting with negatively charged amino acids in the D-box14. In contrast,
mutation of E465, which interacts with the conserved arginine of the D-box14 but lies distant
from the apcin-binding pocket, decreased the ability of Cdc20 to rescue degradation, but had
little effect on apcin binding. E180 lies further away and mutation to alanine had no effect
on apcin binding or rescue activity. Overall, we observed a strong correlation between
effects of mutations on apcin binding and their effects on Cdc20 function for residues that
line the apcin-binding pocket.

Cdc20 is recruited to the APC/C through multiple weak interactions6,8,20-23. For example,
substrates can promote cooperative Cdc20 binding to the APC/C through a co-receptor
interaction in which the substrate is simultaneously recognized by Cdc20 and the APC/
C6-14. Consistent with this idea, we found that addition of substrate increased Cdc20 loading
onto the APC/C in a concentration- and D-box-dependent manner in Xenopus extract (Fig.
3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Substrate-induced loading of Cdc20 could be blocked by
addition of apcin (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a), indicating that the leucine-binding
pocket of Cdc20 is critical for co-receptor function. Because the binding of Cdc20 to the
APC/C was variable in the absence of added substrate, we were not able to assess the effects
of apcin under this condition. Thus we cannot exclude the possibility that apcin might also
decrease Cdc20 binding to the APC/C in the absence of substrate. The small molecule
TAME, which antagonizes the IR-tail interaction between Cdc20 and the APC/C15,16, also
antagonized Cdc20 loading. At high concentrations of substrate, the combined use of apcin
and TAME was more effective at blocking Cdc20 binding to the APC/C than either
compound used alone, suggesting that simultaneous disruption of multiple interactions
between substrate, Cdc20, and APC/C may be an effective strategy for inhibiting APC/C.

Because substrates can be recruited to the APC/C through both D-box-dependent and independent mechanisms, we compared the ability of apcin to stabilize different APC/C
substrates in mitotic Xenopus extract. Apcin stabilized cycB1-NT and securin most
effectively (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figs. 4c and 5b), with somewhat weaker effects
against full-length cyclin B1 (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Interestingly, even high
concentrations of apcin failed to stabilize cyclin A2 or Nek2A (Fig. 3b and Extended Data
Fig. 4c), suggesting that apcin is highly specific for the D-box binding site. In contrast,
TAME inhibited the degradation of all APC/C substrates tested (Fig. 3b and Extended Data
Fig. 4c and 5a,b), consistent with TAME’s ability to directly block recruitment of Cdc20 to
the APC/C15,16. The ability of apcin to inhibit formation of high-molecular weight substrateubiquitin conjugates closely correlated with its ability to stabilize each substrate (Extended
Data Fig. 6). These results suggest that the leucine-binding pocket of Cdc20 plays an
essential role in recruiting the D-boxes of securin and the cycB1-NT, and that apcin can
effectively compete with these interactions. The ability of full-length cyclin B1 and cyclin

A2 to bind Cks1 via Cdk1 may facilitate their D-box-independent recruitment to the APC/
C24,25, helping these substrates partially overcome the effects of apcin. Furthermore, the Nterminal region of cyclin A2 appears to bind Cdc20 with higher affinity than cyclin B126,
which may further reduce the effectiveness of apcin. In contrast to these substrates whose
degradation is D-box-dependent, Nek2A is recruited directly to the APC/C via a Cdc20independent mechanism that requires its MR-tail rather than a D-box27-29, explaining why
apcin fails to inhibit ubiquitylation or degradation of this protein.

Because apcin and TAME inhibit APC/C-dependent proteolysis by distinct mechanisms, we
tested the effect of combining the inhibitors on the proteolysis of APC/C substrates in
Xenopus extract. The combination of apcin and TAME led to synergistic stabilization of
cyclin B1, cycB1-NT, securin, and cyclin A2, with a much weaker effect for Nek2A (Fig. 3c
and Extended Data Figs. 4d and 5a,b). For example, combining TAME and apcin at 25 μM
each was more effective at stabilizing cyclin B1 than using either compound alone at 100
μM. Apcin slightly enhanced the ability of TAME to stabilize Nek2A (Fig. 3c), suggesting
that the leucine-binding pocket of Cdc20 may bind Nek2A, even though this interaction is
not essential for proteolysis if the APC/C is not otherwise perturbed. We next examined the
effect of apcin, proTAME15 (a cell-permeable TAME prodrug), and the combination, on
mitotic exit in four different human cell lines. Apcin and proTAME synergized to increase
the mitotic fraction in all cell lines examined (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). ApcinM was inactive whereas apcin-P retained activity (Extended Data Fig. 7c), consistent with
effects on Cdc20 binding and APC/C-dependent proteolysis in Xenopus extract. In live-cell
imaging experiments in RPE1 cells (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Figs. 8a-d and Extended Data
Videos 1 and 2), 25 μM apcin had no detectable effect on mitotic duration (P= 0.279) unless
mitosis was artificially shortened by depletion of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
protein Mad2 (P= 0.0001). In contrast, in the presence of proTAME, the addition of apcin
dramatically slowed the rate of mitotic exit in a synergistic manner (Fig. 4b and Extended
Data Fig. 8a-d): the rate of mitotic exit was 63% of that predicted by a multiplicative
combination of the single compound effects (P= 0.016). Significant synergy was also
observed in U2OS cells (P=2.0×10-8; Extended Data Fig. 8e). Addition of the inactive
derivative apcin-M had no effect on the rate of mitotic exit in the presence of proTAME
(P=0.68; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8a-e). The response of cells to proTAME alone was
biphasic, because prolongation of metaphase can cause cohesion fatigue30, which reactivates
the SAC to block mitotic exit in a subpopulation of cells. Notably, the addition of apcin
eliminated the biphasic response. Furthermore, the combined effect of apcin and proTAME
was largely preserved when the SAC was inactivated by Mad2 depletion. When modeled
quantitatively, the degree of synergy between apcin and proTAME was in fact enhanced in
the absence of Mad2, as the rate of mitotic exit was reduced to 38% of the rate predicted by
a multiplicative combination of the single compound effects (P= 8.92×10-5; Extended Data
Fig. 8d). Together these findings suggest that synergistic inhibition of mitotic exit does not
rely on the SAC, but instead likely arises from direct pharmacologic APC/C inhibition.
The discovery of apcin and the elucidation of its mechanism validate the importance of the
leucine-binding pocket in Cdc20 as a D-box co-receptor. Apcin preferentially stabilizes
APC/C substrates whose degradation is D-box dependent. However, on its own, low
concentrations of apcin do not effectively block mitotic exit, either because substrates can

outcompete apcin binding to the leucine-binding pocket, or because substrates can be
recruited to the APC/C through other mechanisms. The effectiveness of apcin can be
dramatically enhanced by the addition of TAME, which blocks Cdc20 loading through a
distinct mechanism, highlighting the importance of multiple weak protein-protein
interactions in promoting activator binding and efficient substrate ubiquitylation (Extended
Data Fig. 9). Our work highlights the possibility of disrupting the function of a protein
machine by simultaneously inhibiting multiple protein-protein interactions. Because
dynamic protein complexes regulate virtually all aspects of cell biology, simultaneous
targeting of multiple weak interactions may represent a new opportunity for therapeutic
targeting of protein complexes that may otherwise be difficult to inhibit with a single
compound.

Assessment of substrate degradation in Xenopus egg extract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Use of female Xenopus laevis for production of cytoplasmic egg extracts was approved by
the Harvard Medical School standing committee on animals (Protocol Number 03231).
Interphase Xenopus egg extract was prepared from eggs laid overnight according to the
protocol of Murray31 with the exception that eggs were activated with 2 μg/ml calcium
ionophore (A23187) for 30 minutes prior to the crushing spin. Extract was frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Interphase extract was induced to enter mitosis by addition of
nondegradable cyclin B (MBP-Δ90) at 20 μg/ml and incubated at 22-24 °C for 30-60
minutes. MBP-Δ90 consists of a fusion of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) to Xenopus
cyclin B1 lacking its N-terminal 90 amino acids32 and was expressed in E. coli by inducing
cultures at an OD600 of 0.6 with 300 μM isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) for 5 h at room
temperature (RT). Purification was carried out following New England BioLabs (NEB)
protocol. To promote degradation in interphase extract, Cdh1 protein, expressed in

baculovirus, was added to extract at a final concentration of 50 nM in the presence of 75 μM
roscovitine. Roscovitine addition is necessary to suppress inhibitory phosphorylation of
Cdh1 by Cdk1. Extract was then pretreated with drug (DMSO, apcin, and/or TAME) for 15
minutes at 22 °C before addition of substrates. Substrates consisted of human full length
cyclin B1, cyclin A2, securin, Nek2A, or an N-terminal fragment (residues 1-88) of human
cyclin B1 (cyc B1-NT). Each substrate was amplified with primers by PCR to allow T7dependent transcription of the PCR product. Substrates were expressed and labeled
with 35S-methionine (Perkin Elmer NEG709A500UC) using the TNT system (Promega). To
measure degradation of substrates, extract was pretreated with DMSO or test compounds for
10 minutes in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to prevent re-incorporation of free
labeled amino acid. The in vitro-translation reaction was then added to the Xenopus extract
at 10% final volume. Extract was then incubated at 24 °C, with shaking at 1250 rpm, with
samples taken at indicated times. Reactions were quenched with sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) sample buffer and processed for SDS-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
and phosphor imaging (Bio-Rad PMI) and quantification was performed using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad).

Assessment of substrate ubiquitylation in mitotic Xenopus egg extract
Interphase Xenopus egg extract was supplemented with MBP-Δ90 to promote entry into
mitosis. Mitotic extract was then treated for 30 minutes at 24 °C with 20 μM ubiquitinvinyl
sulfone (UbVS; U-202, Boston Biochem) to suppress deubiquitylation and with 100 μg/ml
cycloheximide to prevent re-incorporation of free labeled amino acid. Subsequently,
mixtures containing apcin or DMSO, as indicated, proteasome inhibitor MG262 (150 μM)
and wild-type ubiquitin (44 μM) were added to UbVS-treated extract and incubated for
additional 10 minutes, at 24 °C with agitation. In vitro-translation reactions expressing
human full length cyclin B1, cyclin A2, securin, Nek2A, or cycB1- NT with 35S-methionine
labeling were also pre-treated with UbVS at 20 μM and added to pre-treated extract at 10%
final volume. Extract was then incubated at 24 °C, with shaking at 1250 r.p.m., and substrate
ubiquitylation monitored by taking samples at indicated times. Reactions were quenched
with SDS sample buffer and processed for SDS-PAGE and phosphor imaging (Bio-Rad
PMI), and quantification was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).

Measurement of the apcin-Cdc20 interaction in Xenopus egg extract using cellular thermal
shift assay (CETSA)
The CETSA method33 was adapted to examine apcin engagement of endogenous Cdc20 in
Xenopus egg extract. Interphase extract was diluted ten-fold and incubated with various
concentrations of apcin dissolved in DMSO in a total volume of 200 μl, with a final DMSO
concentration of 1%. After 10-minute incubation at RT, 50 μl of the lysate was transferred
into PCR tubes (20170-012, VWR) and heated in a PCR machine (Mastercycler gradient,
Eppendorf) for 3 minutes at 46 °C, followed by cooling for 3 minutes at RT. These
conditions were established in preliminary experiments as the temperature that yielded the
greatest degree of Cdc20 precipitation that could be rescued by apcin treatment (data not
shown). The heated lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. (20,000 × g) for 20 minutes at
4 °C in order to separate the soluble fractions from precipitates. Twenty μl of the
supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer and the fraction of soluble Cdc20 was

analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-Cdc20 western blot. Quantification of soluble Cdc20 was
done using Fuji Imager LAS3000 and Image J software. Soluble Cdc20 levels were
normalized to soluble Cdc20 in samples treated with the highest concentration of apcin.
Measurement of Cdc20 binding to APC/C in Xenopus egg extract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine levels of Cdc20 associated with APC/C, the APC/C was immunopurified from
mitotic Xenopus egg extract. For 100 μl extract, 2 μg of anti-Cdc27 antibody (AF3.1, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was cross-linked to 5 μl of Affiprep Protein A beads (156-0006, BioRad) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Apcin, TAME or DMSO was mixed with extract upon
addition to anti-Cdc27-Affiprep Protein A beads in the presence or absence of cycB1-NT
containing a HA-tag at N-terminus and his tag at C-terminus, as previously described34.
Following incubation with extract, beads were washed quickly three times with 20-fold
volume of XB (10 mM potassium HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM
MgCl2) and combined with SDS sample buffer. For analysis of Cdc20 binding to APC/C,
samples were processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against Cdc20 and APC/C
subunit Cdc27. Chemiluminescence was imaged on a Fuji LAS 3000 with Image Reader
LAS-3000 software. Levels of Cdc20 were quantified using Image J and data was
normalized to respective Cdc27 levels.
Coupling of apcin-A to affigel-10 resin
Affigel-10 resin (153-6099, Bio-Rad) was washed twice with DMSO and dried. The resin
was then mixed with 5 mM or 15 mM apcin-A dissolved in DMSO (2x volume of dry resin).
N,N-diisopropylethylamine was diluted 50-fold into the solution. The resin was rotated at
RT for 2 h and the reaction was quenched with 1/5 resin volume of ethanolamine. The resin
was then washed sequentially with isopropanol, water and XB + 0.05% Tween. The resin
was stored at 4 °C as a 50% slurry in XB + 0.05% Tween.
Cdc20 depletion by apcin-A resin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For a round of depletion of Cdc20 from mitotic Xenopus extract, apcin-A resin (15 mM
coupling) was incubated with extract at 4 °C rotating for 30 minutes. The volume of resin
used was 40% of the extract volume. Three rounds of depletion were performed. To rescue
degradation in the depleted extract, reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro-translated human
Cdc20 or control reticulocyte lysate, treated as for a translation reaction but with no DNA
template, was added to the extract at 1/10th extract volume.
Assay for Cdc20 binding to apcin-A resin
Human Cdc20 in pCS2 vector was mutated at the various residues described with the
Quikchange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) and custom primers for
each sequence. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. For a single pull down assay, 5
μl of apcin-A resin (5 mM coupling) was incubated with 30 μl diluted in vitro-translated
human Cdc20 or other WD40 proteins (5 μl reticulocyte lysate diluted to 30 μl with XB +
0.05% Tween) at 24 °C with shaking (1500 RPM) for 30 minutes. Competitors were pre
incubated with Cdc20 in reticulocyte lysate for 2 minutes at RT before adding to apcin-A
resin. Bound and input Cdc20 were detected by western blotting (Fig. 1e,f). Cdc20, other

Assessment of kinetics of APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation in a reconstituted system
Measurements of kinetics of ubiquitylation were performed using cycB1-NT and APC/C
isolated from Xenopus extract, exactly as previously described16, in the presence or absence
of 50 μM apcin. The Ki was calculated based on the assumption of a competitive inhibition
model according to the equation: Kmapcin=Kmuntreated (1+[I]/Ki), where [I]=50 μM; Kmapcin
(773 nM) and Kmuntreated (245 nM) were the average values from three independent
experiments. P value was calculated by an unpaired t-test.
Antibody-based depletion of Cdc20 from Xenopus extract
Cdc20 antibody, covalently coupled to Affiprep protein-A beads as described15, was
incubated with mitotic extract at 4 °C with rotation for 30 minutes. The volume of antibody
beads used was 20% of the reaction volume. Three rounds of depletion were performed,
with separation of extract from beads after each round by centrifugation in spin columns
(89868, Thermo-Pierce).

A fusion of the N-terminal domain of cyclin B1 to luciferase17 was added to mitotic extract
at 4 μg/ml (Fig. 1d) or to interphase extract at 250 μg/ml for 10 minutes at RT then diluted to
a final concentration of 4 μg/ml final in mitotic extract (Fig. 2c). The extract was incubated
at RT and 3 μL samples were taken at 0, 20, 40 and 60 minutes. The samples were mixed
quickly with 30 μL luciferin assay buffer (270 μM coenzyme A, 20 mM tricine, 3.67 mM

protease cleavage site was introduced into the N-terminus of Cdc20. Sf9 insect cells were
infected with the Cdc20 baculovirus and harvested at about 60 hours post-infection. His6tagged Cdc20-WD40 was purified with Ni2+-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) and cleaved with
TEV protease to remove the His6-tag. The Cdc20-WD40 protein was further purified by
anion exchange chromatography with a Mono-Q column followed by size exclusion
chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Purified Cdc20-WD40 was
concentrated to 4-5 mg/ml in the Superdex 200 column buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH
8.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol and 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.
The Cdc20-WD40 protein was crystallized at 20°C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion
method with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid
(MES, pH 6.5), 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, and 5% MPD. The Cdc20Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 October 30.

WD40 crystals were transferred to a new 2μl sitting drop with a reservoir solution
containing 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5) and 20% (w/v) PEG 6000 and soaked for 3-5 hours to get
rid of bound MPD. Apcin compound was dissolved into DMSO and added to the same drop
at the final concentration of 5 mM. After overnight soaking, the crystals were cryo-protected
in a solution containing 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 20% (w/v) PEG 6000, 10% glycerol and 5
mM apcin, and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystals diffracted to a minimum Bragg
spacing (dmin) of about 2.1 Å and exhibited the symmetry of space group P21 with cell
dimensions of a = 41 Å, b = 87 Å, c = 48 Å, and b = 113° and contained one Cdc20
molecule per asymmetric unit.
Data collection and structure determination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID (SBC-CAT) at the Advanced Photon
Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois, USA) and processed with
HKL300035. Phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser using the crystal
structure of human Cdc20-WD40 (PDB code: 4GGC) as search model36. Iterative model
building and refinements were carried out with COOT and Phenix, respectively37,38. The
final model for Cdc20-WD40-apcin (Rwork = 16.5%, Rfree = 21.3%) contains 313 residues,
82 water molecules and one apcin molecule. MolProbity was used for structure validation to
show that all models have good geometry, except for one surface residue that is an outlier in
a Ramachandran plot39. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized
in Extended Data Table 1.
High-throughput image-based assay to measure mitotic fraction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Parental A549, U2OS, and hTERT-RPE1 cells were purchased from ATCC. DLD-1 cells
were purchased from Sigma. For hTERT-RPE1, A549 and U20S cells, stable cell lines
expressing H2B-GFP were derived using described methods40 and used in the experiments.
DLD-1 cells were used without further modification. Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma
contamination (Lonza kit LT07-218) after they were derived and were found negative. For
each cell line, asynchronous cells were resuspended to a density of 3.75 × 104 cells/ml. A
WellMate dispenser (Thermo Scientific) was used to distribute 40 μL of suspension to each
well of a black, clear-bottom 384-well plate (3712, Corning). Plates were sealed with
breathable white rayon sealing tape (241205, Nunc) during plating and subsequent
incubation. After 24 hours incubation, the cells were treated with indicated concentrations of
apcin and proTAME dissolved in DMSO, in four technical replicates. After 18 hours, cells
were fixed and stained directly without wash steps to avoid loss of mitotic cells, by adding
10 μl of 6x concentrated fixing/staining reagent (60% Formalin, 0.6% Triton X-100, and 1.5
μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in DPBS). The plates were sealed with aluminum sealing tape
(276014, Nunc) and incubated at RT for 40 minutes before imaging. Plates were then
imaged at 4 positions per well using an ImageXpress Micro (Molecular Devices) highthroughput microscope, using a 10x objective, yielding a total of 16 images per condition
(four images × four replicates). Cell images were processed automatically in ImageJ to
identify the nuclei and count the number of nuclei and determine maximum fluorescence
intensity of each nucleus in each image. The output files from ImageJ for each treatment
were pooled and the cumulative frequency curves of maximum intensity for the cell
population in each treatment was computed using Matlab. An intensity threshold was set

Fluorescence live cell imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For experiments with RPE1-H2B-GFP cells, asynchronous RPE1-H2B-GFP cells were
plated in 24-well glass-bottom plates (Greiner BioOne, 662892) 18–24 hours prior to siRNA
transfection using RNAiMax (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with Mad 2 siRNA
(GGAACAACUGAAAGAUUGGdTdT, synthesized by Dharmacon) or non-targeting
control siRNA (D-001210-01-20, Dharmacon) at a final concentration of 20 nM. Twentyfour hours following transfection, cells were treated with compounds and imaging was
initiated following compound treatment. For U2OS-H2B-GFP cells, the cells were first
synchronized by double thymidine block (18 hour first block, 8 hour release, 17 hour second
block, thymidine concentration 2 mM). Compounds were added at 7 hours after release from
the second block and imaging was initiated following compound treatment. To measure
efficiency of Mad2 knockdown by siRNA, Western blot samples were each prepared from a
single well of the 24-well glass-bottom plates. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells
were collected by trypsinization, pelleting, and resuspension in 2x NuPAGE sample buffer
(Invitrogen) + 50 mM DTT.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For imaging, plates were inserted into a covered chamber supplied with humidified 5% CO2
and mounted onto a motorized microscope stage (Prior Scientific). Differential interference
contrast and fluorescence images were captured at 6 minute intervals for 45 hours using a
Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope fitted with a 37°C enclosed incubation chamber
and using a 20X Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective lens. A Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD
camera collected the images with 2×2 binning using Nikon Elements software (version 3.0).
Videos were manually analyzed using Nikon Elements software or ImageJ. Mitotic duration
was defined as the time from nuclear envelope breakdown until anaphase, in the case of
normal mitosis, or until exit from prolonged mitosis as indicated by cytoplasmic blebbing
accompanied by changes in chromatin as detected by H2B-GFP. Cell fate was scored as
“division” if two daughter cells were produced by mitosis of any duration, and “abnormal
exit” if a single cell of interphase appearance resulted after that cell was in a mitotic state of
any duration. The “death” fate describes cells that entered mitosis and died while in mitosis.
Methods for the statistical analysis of live cell imaging data are presented in Supplementary
Information.

a, Apcin inhibits formation of high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates of full-length
cyclin B1. Mitotic Xenopus extract was pretreated with the deubiquitinating enzyme
inhibitor ubiquitin vinyl sulfone (Ub-VS, 20 μM) and proteasome inhibitor MG262 (150
μM) to stabilize ubiquitin conjugates. 35S-labeled cyclin B1 was added together with

shows quantitation of the experiment. b, Apcin acts as a competitive inhibitor of APC/Cdependent ubiquitylation. APC/C was purified from mitotic Xenopus extracts and the initial
rates of ubiquitylation of HA-tagged cycB1- NT were measured in the presence of
methylated ubiquitin to prevent ubiquitin chain elongation. The reaction was stopped at 45
seconds and the products were detected by anti-HA blot. The left panel shows the anti-HA

suggests a role for E465 of Cdc20 in a charge-based interaction with the D-box, consistent
with our data that the E465S mutation disrupts the ability of Cdc20 to promote substrate
degradation more than it perturbs apcin binding. c, Depletion with anti-Cdc20 antibody

Extended Data Figure 6. Apcin has differential effects on substrate ubiquitylation in mitotic
Xenopus extract that correlate with effects on proteolysis

To examine the profile of ubiquitylated species generated in Xenopus extract,
deubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation were inhibited by pre-treatment with
the general deubiquitinating-enzyme inhibitor ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (UbVS; 20 μM), as
established previously34, and the proteasome-inhibitor MG262 (150 μM). Next, wild-type
ubiquitin (Ub; 44 μM) and apcin (100 μM) or DMSO were added. 35S-labeled APC/C
substrates expressed in reticulocyte lysate were introduced into treated extract and their
ubiquitylation at indicated times assessed by SDS-PAGE and phosphor imaging. Levels of
substrates that were not modified with Ub (unconjugated), modified with 1-3 Ubs (substrateUb, Ub≤3) or modified with more than 3 Ub moieties (substrate-Ub, Ub>3) were quantitated
by phosphorimaging and plotted relative to radiolabeled protein in the respective region of
the gel at 0 minutes in the apcin or DMSO sample. a, cycB1-NT; b, cyclin B1; c Nek2A; d,

molecular weight Ub conjugates (as indicated by inspection of the gel image) but does not
reduce the fraction of conjugates modified with more than three ubiquitins (as indicated by
the quantitation). These results are consistent with the inability of apcin to stabilize cyclin
A2 in proteolysis assays, given that the proteasome typically requires at least 4 ubiquitin
molecules to be attached to a substrate for efficient proteolysis.

of proTAME +/- apcin-M. To determine P-values for the pairwise comparisons of proTAME
vs. apcin-M + proTAME, we fit a Cox proportional hazards model similar to that described
in the methods but with just an apcin-M effect and analyzed just the subset of cells that were
treated with either proTAME only or apcin-M + proTAME. The table labeled “Synergy
between apcin and proTAME” shows the rate of mitotic exit with both compounds (apcin +
proTAME), relative to what would be predicted by a multiplicative combination of the
effects of each compound alone. The magnitude of the synergy is roughly doubled when
checkpoint activity is reduced by Mad2 siRNA. e, Synchronized U2OS H2B-GFP cells were
treated with apcin or apcin-M (25 μM) and/or proTAME (12 μM). Cells were then imaged
every 6 or 10 minutes for 45 hours. Mitotic duration and cell fate were determined by
manual inspection of the videos and plotted as Kaplan-Meier curves. The hatch marks on the
Kaplan-Meier curved indicate mitotic duration endpoints of censored cells. Graphs include
the combined results of five independent experiments. U2OS model differs from the model
used to test RPE1 data in that the U2OS analysis is not stratified by either date or person,
and the U2OS data does not include an effect of apcin-M alone (in the absence of
proTAME). Pairwise comparison between proTAME and proTAME+apcin-M tested using a
Cox proportional hazards model stratified by date, using data from only the experimental
blocks in which both proTAME and proTAME+apcin were tested.

Effects of apcin on Cdc20 binding to APC/C and stability of APC/C substrates in mitotic
Xenopus extract. a, Apcin blocks co-receptor-dependent binding of Cdc20 to APC/C.
Substrate (cycB1-NT, 1 μM or 10 μM), apcin and/or TAME (50 μM each) were added, and
APC/C was isolated with anti-Cdc27 antibody. Levels of Cdc20 were assessed by western
blotting and normalized to the levels of Cdc27. b, Effect of apcin and TAME on APC/C
substrate stability. Levels of 35S-labeled substrates were assessed by gel electrophoresis and
phosphorimaging. c, As in b except that combinations of apcin and TAME were examined.
Values and error bars in a, b, c represent mean of three experiments +/- S.E.M.

Apcin synergizes with proTAME to prolong mitotic duration. a, RPE1 cells were treated
with indicated concentrations of apcin and proTAME for 18 hours, fixed, and mitotic index
determined by automated high-throughput imaging. The panel shows the difference between
the mitotic indices calculated by a Bliss-independence model compared to a synergy model;
any positive value indicates synergy. * P<0.05 based on analysis of four technical replicates.
b, Asynchronous RPE1 cells expressing H2B-GFP were transfected with siRNA and
twenty-four hours later treated with apcin or apcin-M (25 μM) and/or proTAME (6 μM).
Cells were then imaged every 6 minutes for 45 hours. Mitotic duration and cell fate
(Extended Data Fig. 8b) were determined by manual inspection of the videos and plotted as
inverse cumulative frequency (-proTAME) or Kaplan-Meier curves (+proTAME). The hatch
marks on the Kaplan-Meier curves indicate censored cells that did not exit mitosis or die in
mitosis before the end of the movie or before they migrated out of the field of view. Graphs
include the combined results of two independent experiments.
