Abstract
Centrosomal Aurora-A (Aur-A) kinase ensures proper spindle
assembly and accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis.
Overexpression of Aur-A leads to centrosome amplification,
aberrant spindle, and consequent genetic instability. In the
present study, Aur-A was found to be overexpressed in
laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Moreover, Aur-A
expression was adversely correlated with median survival, and
further identified as a potential independent factor for disease
prognosis. Suppression of Aurora kinase activity chemically or
genetically led to LSCC Hep2 cell cycle arrest and apoptotic
cell death. Importantly, we found that Aur-A increases cell
migration and this novel function was correlated with Akt1
activation. The enhanced cell migration induced by Aur-A
overexpression could be abrogated by either small-molecule
Akt1 inhibitor or short interfering RNA. VX-680, a selective
Aurora kinase inhibitor, decreased Akt1 phosphorylation at
Ser473 and inhibited cell migration, but failed to do so in
constitutive active Akt1 (myr-Akt1)–overexpressed cells. Moreover, our data suggested that overexpression of Aur-A kinase
might also contribute to radioresistance of LSCC. Inhibiting
Aur-A by VX-680 induced expression of p53 and potently
sensitized cells to radiotherapy, leading to significant cell
death. Ectopic overexpression of Aur-A, however, reduced p53
level and rendered cells more resistant to irradiation. Taken
together, we showed that Aur-A kinase, a negative prognostic
marker, promotes migration and reduces radiosensitivity in
laryngeal cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10436–44]

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), contributing
to 6% to 10% of all cancers, is one of the most commonly occurring
types of human tumor (1). Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(LSCC) accounts for the highest mortality among this group. LSCC
remains the only type of cancer where no significant improvement
has been made regarding 5-year survival rate in the past 25 years,
making new therapeutic target identification an urgent task.
Recent studies have shown that expressions of a number of tumor-

associated genes are altered in LSCC, including EGFR (2, 3), p53 (4),
p21 (5), and Bcl-2 (6). High-resolution cDNA array highlighted that
alteration of gene expression may be critical to LSCC pathogenesis
(7). However, few genes have provided consistent prognostic value
for the disease, and the potential therapeutic significance of these
genes remains to be clarified.
Mitotic serine/threonine kinases Aurora family, including Aur-A,
Aur-B, and Aur-C, are key players in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during the cell cycle, maintaining genetic
integrity in cell division (8). Aur-C is highly expressed in sperm
cells and has not shown a clear role in cancer (9). Aur-B
phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser10 in vivo, dissociates HP1 from
heterochromatin, and drives chromosome condensation (10). We
and others previously showed that Aur-A was essential in proper
timing of mitotic entry and formation of bipolar spindles (11, 12).
Forced overexpression of Aur-A in cells leads to centrosome amplification and subsequent multipolar spindle structures (13, 14),
causing genetic instability (aneuploidy), a hallmark of epithelial
carcinoma (15, 16). Aur-A has been found overexpressed in various
types of commonly occurring epithelial carcinomas (reviewed in
ref. 17). Recent functional microarray analysis further identified
Aur-A as one of the death-from-cancer signature genes differentially regulated in tumors (18). Small-molecule Aurora kinase
inhibitors have been recently developed as potential targeting
therapeutics (19). Among these, VX-680 with more Aur-A selectivity
showed appealing preclinical evidence of anticancer activity in vivo
(20–22).
Aurora kinases in tumorigenesis have been associated with their
indispensable roles in ensuring proper mitotic events. Aur-A
physically associates with a number of cell cycle regulators,
including p53, TPX2, BRCA1, Ajuba, and TACC (15). For example,
p53 binds to the NH2-terminal region of Aur-A and suppresses its
oncogenic activity in vivo in a transactivation-independent manner
(23). Conversely, Aur-A physically binds and phosphorylates p53 at
Ser215 and Ser315 (24, 25). Phosphorylation at Ser315 destabilizes p53
and targets it for MDM2-mediated degradation. Consequently,
elevated Aur-A expression impairs tumor-suppressing function of
p53, and overrides apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by DNA
damage. However, little is known about dysregulation of Aur-A
kinase in other aspects of tumorigenesis besides its role in
interrupting normal mitotic events.
Here, we found that Aur-A expression was elevated in LSCC
tissues and Hep2 cells. Analysis of clinicopathologic characteristics
revealed that Aur-A expression was adversely correlated with
median survival. Cox regression analysis identified Aur-A as an
independent factor for clinical prognosis. Suppression of Aur-A
kinase activity by VX-680 or short interfering RNA (siRNA)
inhibited cell growth and led to apoptotic cell death in Hep2 cells.

Aurora Kinase, a Biomarker and Therapeutic Target

More importantly, we found that overexpression of Aur-A led to
enhanced Akt1 phosphorylation at its activation site (Ser473) and
remarkably increased cell migration ability. Suppression of Aur-A
by either VX-680 or siRNA decreased Akt1 Ser473 phosphorylation
and markedly reduced Hep2 cell migration rates. Moreover, in Hep2
cells with a constitutive active form of Akt1 (myr-Akt1), VX-680
failed to reduce cell migration. Last, we revealed that inhibition of
Aur-A by VX-680 induced p53 expression and effectively sensitized
laryngeal cancer cells to radiotherapy. Together, we showed that
Aur-A served as both a potential negative prognostic biomarker for
clinical prognosis and a promising molecular target for more
selective therapeutic treatment in LSCC.

Materials and Methods
Patients and clinical tissue specimens. Patients were all first clinically
diagnosed and pathologically confirmed of LSCC between 1995 and 1998. Of
the participating patients, 15 patients had inadequate clinical follow-up,
leaving 77 patients for analysis. Pertinent patient clinical reports were
obtained with prior patient consent and the approval of the institutional
Clinical Ethics Review Board. All of the 77 specimens and additional 35
normal adjacent tissues were collected and fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin in the diagnostic histopathology laboratory at the Cancer Center
of Sun Yat-sen University. A portion of tumor specimens were also kept in
liquid nitrogen and sectioned for protein and RNA extraction. In all cases,
the tissues were collected from the time of original diagnosis and before any
treatments. Median clinical follow-up for the patients was 72 months (range
from 3 to 136 months). Patient clinicopathologic features were shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Tumors were staged according to Union
Internationale Contra Cancrum classification (1997): stage I (14 cases),
stage II (30 cases), stage III (15 cases), and stage IV (18 cases). Tumors were
also clinically classified as supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic, and were
graded as well, moderately, and poorly differentiated.
Cell culture. Hep2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/mL), and
streptomycin (100 units/mL) at 37jC in humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Immunofluorescence staining. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences) at room temperature for 20 min and
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4jC.
Immunostaining of cell was done as previously described (26) and
visualized at 20jC using a microscope (Leica).
Immunohistochemical staining of Aur-A expression. Tissue specimens in paraffin were sectioned, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated.
Antigenic retrieval was processed with sodium citrate. The sections
were then incubated in H2O2 (3%) for 10 min, and blocked in 1% bovine
serum albumin for 60 min followed by anti–Aur-A antibody (Upstate) at
4jC overnight. After being incubated with the secondary antibody for
60 min, specimens were incubated with H2O2-diaminobenzidine until the
desired stain intensity developed. Sections were all counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. The extent of immunohistochemical staining of the sections was evaluated by at least two independent
investigators. Moderate or strong cytoplasm staining was considered as
positive reaction. In analysis, specimen was determined as positive
staining for Aur-A when >30% cells showed visible brown granules in the
cytoplasm (27).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Cells or tissues were collected and
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription of the total RNA, the
first-strand cDNA was then used as templates for detecting of the Aur-A
expression. A pair of primers, Aur-A-F: CATGGACCGATCTAAAGAAAACT
and Aur-A-R: AAGATGGAGCATGTACTGACC, was used. For S26, the
primers were S26-F: CCGTGCCTCCAAGATGACAAAG and S26-R:
GTTCGGTCCTTGCGGGCTTCAC.

different doses of VX-680. Cell growth was assessed as described previously
(28). Triplicate wells were assayed for each condition and SDs were
determined.
Cell lysate and Western blot analysis. Cells or tissues were lysed on ice
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer. The protein concentration
was determined by the Bradford dye method (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal
amounts of cell extract were subjected to electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for antibody
blotting. Mouse anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was from Ambion; rabbit anti–phosphorylated Aur-A/AIK (Thr288) antibody,
mouse anti–cleaved poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) antibodies, mouse
anti–phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10), and rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt
(Ser473) were from Cell Signaling; goat anti-Akt1 was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; and rabbit anti-Aurora A and mouse anti-p53 were from
Upstate.
Flow cytometry analysis. Cells were seeded into six-well plates and
incubated with VX-680 or DMSO at 37jC and collected. Single-cell
suspensions were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min, labeled with
propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 15 min in dark, and
analyzed directly on a Becton Dickinson FACScan.
Transwell migration assay. Cells were starved overnight in assay
medium (RPMI 1640 with 1% FBS). Top chambers of 24-well transwell plates
(Corning, Inc.) were pretreated with 1% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in PBS
and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were added to the top
chambers of the plates. Media with or without VX-680 were added to both
chambers. After incubation, top cells were removed and bottom cells were
fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 Ag/mL) to visualize
nuclei. The number of migrating cells in five fields was counted under
fluorescence microscope, and the mean for each chamber was determined.
siRNA transfection. Cells were seeded onto six-well plate 16 h before
transfection. In each well, 50 nmol/L of siRNA Aur-A: AUGCCCUGUCUUACUGUCA, Akt1: AAGGAGGGUUGGCUGCACAAA, or scramble sequences
and 10 AL of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) were added to Opti-MEM
(Life Technologies) and mixed. After incubation, the siRNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 solutions were mixed gently and added to the plates. The plate
was incubated for 48 h until it is ready for further assay.
Generation of stable transfection cell lines. pBabe-puro human Aur-A
was constructed by inserting BamHI and XhoI fragment from pCS2+-hAurA (a gift from Joan Ruderman, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) into
BamHI and SalI sites. Myr-Akt1 was cloned by PCR from Myr-Akt1
(pUSEamp, Upstate) and digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The fragment
was ligated into pBabe-puro vector. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)–
pseudotyped viruses were produced by transfection of the VSV-GPG
producer cell line (a gift from Joan Brugge, Harvard Medical School) with 10
Ag of DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Hep2 cells were infected
with the retroviral viruses, and stable populations were chosen by selection
with 2 Ag/mL puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Radiation clonogenic survival assay. Two hundred cells were seeded
onto six-well plate and incubated 24 h before irradiation. After attachment,
cells were treated with VX-680 in some cases. Cells were then irradiated
with 0 to 2 Gy of irradiation dose of X-ray. Cells were stained with Giemsa
dye and clones were counted on day 10, and survival fractions were
calculated to evaluate radiosensitivity.
Statistics. Survival was defined as months from diagnosis to death
because of any cause. Survival was determined by the method of Kaplan
and Meier. Differences of survival due to Aur-A expression were compared
between groups of patients by the log-rank test. The effect of predictive
variables was evaluated by Cox univariate and multivariate regression
models. All P values quoted are two sided. P < 0.05 is considered statistically
significant. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS v. 11.0 (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Aur-A is overexpressed in LSCC tissues and cell line. To study
the potential role of Aur-A in pathogenesis of LSCC, we first asked
if the level of Aur-A protein was elevated in primary tumor tissues.

matched adjacent normal tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis with Aur-A antibody. Aur-A was highly
expressed in tumor specimens with a positive rate of 71.4%
(55 of 77) when >30% of intracellular staining in a paraffin section
was defined as positive (27). All adjacent normal tissues studied
(35 of 35) were lower in Aur-A expression. A typical immunohistochemical staining of either specimen was shown in Fig. 1A.
Notably, in each LSCC tissue, Aur-A was strongly stained within
tumor foci of epithelial cells, whereas staining of the adjacent
connective tissues was also much weaker for Aur-A expression.
We next verified Aur-A expression in paired freshly frozen tumor
and normal adjacent biopsy samples with Western blot analysis.
Aur-A was highly expressed in tumor samples collected but was
under detectable level in paired normal adjacent tissues, comparing four typical pairs (Fig. 1B). LSCC Hep2 cell line also expressed a
high Aur-A level. In addition, total RNA from tumor samples and
their matched normal adjacent tissues were extracted and
measured for Aur-A transcripts by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR). Figure 1C showed two typical examples of increasing
copies of Aur-A transcript in LSCC, whereas their normal adjacent
tissues expressed low levels of Aur-A.

Comparison of Aur-A–positive staining rates in various clinical
subgroups revealed a positive correlation between Aur-A expression and clinical tumor stage (Supplementary Table S1). Tumor
level of Aur-A was significantly higher in high-grade (stages III
and IV, 87.9%) versus low-grade (stages I and II, 59.1%) tumor
(P = 0.006). We also observed a trend of preferential expression of
Aur-A in poorly differentiated tumor cells (93.8%) compared with
moderate (61.5%) or well-differentiated (68.6%) samples (P = 0.071).
Aur-A expression was, however, not associated with age, sex, or
clinical classification.
Aur-A expression is inversely correlated with survival rate
in LSCC patients. Because tumor Aur-A level was associated with
advanced tumor stage, we next asked if Aur-A was correlated with
patient prognosis. The median follow-up for the 77 patients was 72
months (range, 3–136 months). As shown in Fig. 1D, overall median
survival time clearly revealed that tumors with positive Aur-A
staining were adversely corrected with patient prognosis, with
46 months (95% confidence interval, 19.5–72.5 months) for AurA–positive cancer patients versus 85 months (95% confidence
interval, 66.8-103.2 months) for Aur-A–negative patients (P =
0.0159). Univariate analysis showed that tumor differentiation

loading was ensured by S26 rRNA. D, Kaplan-Meier plots showed overall survival among 77 patients with LSCC according to Aur-A expression in the primary tumor.
Patients were grouped by positive (>30% cytoplasm staining) and negative (V30% cytoplasm staining) Aur-A staining values (P = 0.0159, log-rank test).

were collected, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis with PARP-specific antibody. D, VX-680 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Hep2 cells were

grade (P = 0.004), tumor stage (P = 0.000), clinical classification
(P = 0.023), positive tumor staining at surgical margin (P = 0.001),
and Aur-A (P = 0.020) each significantly predicted worse prognosis
in LSCC patients (Supplementary Table S2). Among these
prognostic factors, tumor stage, differentiation grade, and clinical
classification has each been indicated to be associated with
outcome of the disease (29). Clinical prognosis was, however, not
associated with age, sex, or treatment modality. We next included
these prognostic factors in Cox multivariate analysis to avoid the
possible interfering interaction effects. Supplementary Table S3
showed that Aur-A status (P = 0.020), as well as differentiation
grade (P = 0.027), tumor stage (P = 0.001), and positive tumor
staining at surgical margin (P = 0.023) was each an independent
prognostic factor for LSCC. Clinical classification, however, was not
an independent predictor (P = 0.839). Thus, we showed that tumor
Aur-A level, as an independent prognostic factor, was adversely
associated with clinical prognosis in LSCC patients.
Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 inhibits the growth of Hep2
cells and causes apoptotic cell death. Association of tumor
overexpression of Aur-A with poor clinical prognosis raises the
possibility of inhibition of Aurora kinase to attenuate LSCC cancer
cells. We first asked if small-molecule VX-680, a selective Aurora
kinase inhibitor (21), could suppress the proliferation of Hep2 cells,

www.aacrjournals.org

where Aur-A is highly expressed. As expected, VX-680 inhibited
Aur-A autophosphorylation at Thr288 within its activation loop
(Fig. 2A, top). At low doses (1–5 nmol/L), VX-680 inactivated Aur-A
kinase; at higher doses (10 nmol/L), Aur-B activity was also
inhibited, as determined by phosphorylation of its specific in vivo
substrate histone H3 at Ser10 (Fig. 2A, bottom). Figure 2B showed
that inhibition of Aurora kinase by VX-680 suppressed growth rate
of Hep2 cells in a dose-dependent manner by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
We next addressed if inhibition of Aur-A activity by VX-680
would lead to apoptosis and arrest cell cycle at mitosis. Western
blot assays showed that VX-680 led to apoptotic cell death in both
dose-dependent and time-dependent manners (Fig. 2C). An
apoptotic marker, cleaved PARP, was readily detected at 12 h in
cells treated with VX-680 (5 nmol/L). Hep2 cells, incubated with
VX-680 (5 nmol/L) for up to 12 h, were collected for flow cytometry.
VX-680 leads to significant G2-M arrest and cell apoptosis as early
as 12 h after VX-680 treatment (Fig. 2D). Cell number arrested in
G2-M increased 3-fold in 12 h (empty column). Accordingly, flow
cytometry also showed increased proportion of apoptotic cells
( filled column). Thus, VX-680 induced G2-M phase arrest and
apoptotic cell death in Hep2 cells may account for its suppression
of cell growth.

Aur-A siRNA induces apoptosis; overexpression enhances
survival against VX-680. We next genetically suppressed endogenous Aur-A by siRNA and studied cell cycle and apoptotic events.
Aur-A protein was substantially reduced (>60%) at 48 h after siRNA
transfection (Fig. 3A). Figure 3B showed that suppression of Aur-A
markedly arrested cells at G2-M and induced apoptotic cell death,
consistent with chemical inhibition of Aurora kinase activity
(Fig. 2). Knowing that VX-680 also at higher doses inhibits other
oncogene products, including Flt3 (21, 30), Abl (31), and Lck (21),
these data pointed that the main target of VX-680 (5 nmol/L)
inhibition in LSCC cells was Aurora kinase. We then ectopically

overexpressed wild-type Aur-A in Hep2 cells. RT-PCR and Western
blot analysis showed that both Aur-A transcripts and protein level
were increased in these cells (Fig. 3C), rendering more resistance to
VX-680–induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 3D).
Inactivation of Aurora kinase inhibits cell migration. We
next asked if small-molecule inactivation of Aurora kinase would
attenuate Hep2 laryngeal carcinoma cell migration. Transwell
migration assay revealed that VX-680 potently inhibited migration
capacity of Hep2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). As
shown in Fig. 2A, at dose of 1 nmol/L, VX-680 potently inhibited
Aur-A activity whereas Aur-B was not significantly affected, as
assessed by phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10. Notably, VX-680
(1 nmol/L) effectively prevented nearly 80% of Hep2 cells from
migrating through the semimembrane, suggesting an important
novel role of Aur-A kinase in cell migration.
We then genetically suppressed Aur-A expression and tested if
similar results were generated as chemical inhibition. Inhibition of
Aur-A expression with siRNA reduced the migration capacity of
Hep2 cell (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Conversely, ectopically
introducing Aur-A in these cells markedly increased migration
capacity (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Thus, it is conceivable that upregulation of Aur-A in LSCC may contribute to cancer invasiveness.
Aur-A promotes Hep2 cell migration by activation of Akt1.
To investigate whether Aur-A–regulated Hep2 migration might be

mediated by Akt1, we detected Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473,
which correlates with Akt1 activation (32), in either Aur-A
overexpressed or suppressed Hep2 cells. We found that Akt1
phosphorylation at this activation site was reduced in Aur-A
suppressed cells but increased in cells overexpressing Aur-A
(Fig. 5A). Similarly, Akt1 activation was also effected by chemical
inhibition of Aur-A by VX-680 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 4C). Phosphorylated Akt1 (Ser473) expression was reduced as
VX-680 dose increased. As shown by previous tests, VX-680 does
not directly inhibit Akt1 (Ki > 1,000; ref. 21). Moreover, API-2, a
specific inhibitor of Akt1, abrogated cell migration increased by
Aur-A overexpression (Fig. 5B). Suppression of Akt1 by siRNA led to
similar results (Fig. 5C). Last, we ectopically introduced a
constitutive active form of Akt1, myr-Akt1, and found surprisingly
that VX-680 did not lead to the similar migration inhibitory effects
in these myr-Akt1–transfected cells (Fig. 5D). These data showed
that Aur-A enhanced cell migration in Hep2 squamous cells, and
further suggested that this function of Aur-A was mediated by Akt1
activation.
Overexpression of Aur-A induces radioresistance; VX-680
sensitizes Hep2 cells for radiotherapy. We next asked if
radiosensitivity in LSCC cells would be decreased by transfection
with Aur-A. As shown in Fig. 6A, Hep2 cells transfected with Aur-A
were rendered more resistance to X-ray irradiation (0.5–2 Gy) than

control cells. Western blot analysis revealed that p53 protein level
was reduced in Aur-A–transfected cells (Fig. 6B, top panels),
consistent with previous report that Aur-A down-regulated p53 by
targeting for MDM2 degradation (24). We then tested if chemical
inhibition of Aurora kinase was able to enhance the sensitivity of
Hep2 cells to radiotherapy. We found that VX-680 (1 and 2 nmol/L)
inhibition of Aur-A kinase effectively sensitized LSCC cells to X-ray
irradiation (0.5 Gy; Fig. 6C). Figure 6D showed a clear dosedependent augment of p53 protein level in Hep2 cells treated with
VX-680. Similar increase of p53 was also seen in Aur-A siRNA cells
(Fig. 6B, bottom panels). These data suggested that Aur-A might
be a critical regulator in radioresistance in LSCC cells; inhibition
of Aurora kinase up-regulated p53 and sensitized cells to radiotherapy.

Discussion
Mitotic Aurora kinases are crucial in maintaining accurate
chromosome segregation. Abnormal expression of Aur-A has been
reported in various cancer types, and in some cases is associated
with poor prognosis. However, Aur-A in LSCC has not been studied,
particularly its nonmitotic-related role in tumorigenesis. In the
present study, we found that Aur-A was overexpressed in LSCC
tumor cells (Fig. 1). Moreover, overexpression of Aur-A was
associated with higher tumor stage (Supplementary Table S1).
Indeed, high Aur-A level was inversely associated with overall

survival of LSCC patients (Fig. 1D), as an independent prognostic
factor (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Additionally, we showed
that specific inhibition of Aurora kinases by small-molecule VX-680
or siRNA suppressed LSCC cell growth and induced apoptotic cell
death, whereas overexpression of Aur-A rendered certain survival
advantage (Figs. 2 and 3). Most importantly, we found that
suppression of Aur-A kinase by VX-680 or siRNA both potently
inhibited tumor cell migration rates (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting a novel nonmitotic role of this mitotic kinase in
metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. Our data further suggested
that Aurora kinase–regulated cell migration might be mediated by
Akt1 activity (Fig. 5). As a major therapeutic approach in LSCC,
radiotherapy benefits most patients with early-stage cancers while
preserving laryngeal function. Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 upregulated p53 and effectively sensitized tumor cells to radiotherapy
whereas excess Aur-A generated radioresistance in Hep2 cells
(Fig. 6). These data have provided clear evidence that the mitotic
kinase Aur-A plays important roles in cell migration and radioresistance in LSCC cells. Collectively, our studies suggested that
Aur-A kinase served as both a prognostic biomarker and a
potential therapeutic target in LSCC.
LSCC remains as one of the tumors of little therapeutic
improvements in the past two decades (1). Identifying new
prognosis predictive markers for individualized treatment
approaches will offer great promise in improving the current

p53 and GAPDH antibodies.

Aurora Kinase, a Biomarker and Therapeutic Target

treatment. In the present study, we provided evidence that level of
Aur-A was a potential independent prognostic factor for LSCC,
suggesting a function of Aur-A up-regulation in the multistage
pathogenesis of this disease. Consistent with our findings, a recent
report showed that Aur-A was overexpressed in HNSCC (33).
Besides serving as a potential prognostic biomarker, our results
also indicated Aur-A kinase as a promising therapeutic target for
LSCC. We clearly showed the potent antitumor activities of VX-680
in laryngeal Hep2 carcinoma cells. Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680
(5 nmol/L) inhibited Hep2 proliferation and induced apoptosis.
Recent studies have revealed that VX-680 also inhibited other
oncoproteins, including Flt3 (Ki = 30; refs. 21, 30), Abl (Ki = 68; ref.
31), and Lck (Ki = 80; ref. 21), albeit at higher doses. Aur-A siRNA
generated similar results as VX-680 inhibition (Fig. 3), indicating
that VX-680–induced antitumor activity in Hep2 cells in our study
was largely due to Aur-A suppression (Fig. 2).
As a well-defined mitotic kinase, little is known about Aurora
kinase in cell migration and its potential involvement in cancer
invasiveness. Importantly, recent advance revealed that classic
mitotic protein cyclin D1, in association with p27kip, promoted
cellular migration via inhibiting Rho/ROCK signaling and thrombospondin 1 (34, 35). Here, we showed that Aurora kinase
promoted laryngeal squamous cancer cells to migrate. This is of
particular interest because a recent report showed that upregulation of mRNA of Aur-A was significantly associated with
tumor distant metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma (33). In
searching for the possible mechanism for this new function of AurA, we found that Aur-A activity was positively correlated with Akt1
phosphorylation at its activation site Ser473 (Fig. 5). Up-regulation
of Akt1 kinase has been shown to involve in altered cell migration
status: Overexpression of Akt1 promotes migratory ability in
cultured squamous carcinoma cells (36), pancreatic cancer cells
(37), and fibrosarcoma cells (38); however, Akt1 reduces cell
invasiveness in some cultured mammary cells (39, 40). Our data
showed that inhibiting Akt1 by either its chemical inhibitor API-2
or siRNA abrogated Aur-A–enhanced cell migration, implying that
Akt1 might act as a downstream mediator in Aur-A migration

pathway. This Aur-A–Akt1 connection was further supported by
the finding that transfection with myr-Akt1, an Akt1 constitutively
active form, blocked VX-680–reduced cell migration (Fig. 5). Thus,
our study showed an unrevealed role of Aur-A in enhancing cell
movement, and this new function of Aur-A was associated with
Akt1 activation in LSCC cells.
Radiotherapy is the major treatment modality for LSCC at early
stages, particularly T1 and T2 cancers for organ preservation.
Sensitivity of tumor cells to radiotherapy is critical for the
probability of local control of the disease. We showed that Aur-A
overexpression rendered radioresistance in LCSS cells (Fig. 6). AurA inhibition effectively increased the sensitivity of LSCC cells to
radiotherapy. Moreover, Aur-A–regulated p53 expression was
correlated with radiosensitivity. These data were consistent with
the previous work that Aur-A down-regulated p53 function (24).
Further study is needed to identify the subgroup of patients who
would benefit from chemical inhibition of Aurora kinase in the
setting of radiotherapy.
Taken together, high tumor level of Aur-A seems to be inversely
associated with survival in LSCC patients as an independent predicting factor. This finding suggests that Aur-A would serve as a
potential biological marker to identify a subgroup of patients of poor
prognosis for new treatment approaches. Aurora kinase–directed
small-molecule inhibitor suppresses cell growth, induces apoptosis,
inhibits cell migration, and sensitizes LSCC cells to radiotherapy,
offering an opportunity for future target-guided therapy.
