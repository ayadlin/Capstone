Abstract
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is characterized by the
accumulation of malignant CD4+ T cells in the skin. Although
the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors on CTCL cells has been studied extensively on ex vivo
isolated cells, very little is known about the dynamics and
mechanisms of CTCL trafficking in vivo. However, detailed
knowledge of the molecular cues mediating CTCL migration
may be used to interfere with their homing to the skin. We
made use of real-time intravital epifluorescence video and
two-photon microscopy to visualize malignant T cells from
Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic variant of CTCL, in dermal
microvessels in mouse ear skin. We found that SS cells rolled
along dermal venules in a P-selectin– and E-selectin–
dependent manner at ratios similar to CD4+ memory T cells
from normal donors. We furthermore show that the chemokine CCL17/TARC, but not CCL27/CTACK, was sufficient to
induce the arrest of SS cells in the microvasculature. However,
a combination of both chemokines was required to induce
extravasation of SS cells. Together, our experiments delineate
the molecular adhesion cascade operant in SS cell homing to
the skin in vivo. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2704–8]

dermal microvessels (6). Furthermore, several chemokine-chemokine receptor pairs, including CCL17/CCR4, CCL27/CCR10, and
CCL1/CCR8 have been implicated in cutaneous T-cell trafficking
(7). However, the precise role of these molecules in the individual
steps of the multistep adhesion cascade has not been studied
microscopically.
The majority of SS cells isolated from blood expresses CCR4, and
cells migrate towards CCL17 in chemotaxis assays (8–10).
Furthermore, immunohistochemistry has shown the expression of
CCR10 by the vast majority of CTCL cells in the skin (9). CCL17 and
CCL27 are both elevated in the serum of patients with CTCL, and
serum levels correlate with disease activity (11, 12). CTCL cells also
express other chemokine receptors, including CXCR4 and CXCR3
(13, 14), but the broad expression patterns of their respective
ligands in a variety of vascular beds questions a role in specific skin
homing. The function of these molecules described on CTCL cells
has not been tested in vivo.
In the present study, we made use of intravital microscopy to
investigate the behavior of SS cells directly within the vasculature
of intact mouse skin. Our results identify the molecular steps
involved in skin migration of SS cells.

Materials and Methods
Introduction

Patients

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a low-grade non-Hodgkin
lymphoma characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant,
epidermotropic CD4 + T-cells. Sezary syndrome (SS) is an
erythrodermic leukemic variant of CTCL with high numbers of
circulating tumor cells, and a poor prognosis (1). It is thought that
the origin of CTCL cells is a mature, CD45RO+CD4+ memory T-cell,
which frequently lacks the expression of CD26 or CD7 (2–4). A key
to understanding the biology and progression of CTCL would be to
decipher the mechanisms involved in their migration to the skin.
Although a number of phenotypic studies have characterized the
expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors on
CTCL cells in vitro, there is little information on the molecular cues
mediating their homing in vivo.
Skin trafficking of normal T lymphocytes has been studied in
the past. Skin-homing memory T-cells can be identified by the
expression of the cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (5).
Cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen serves as a ligand for
E-selectin, which is constitutively expressed on the endothelium of

Patients met International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma criteria for
SS (15). Healthy donors were recruited at the Wistar Institute. Informed
consent was obtained from all donors in accordance with the University of
Pennsylvania and the Wistar Institute ethics committee guidelines.

Reagents
Blocking antibodies against mouse P-selectin (clone 5H1) and E-selectin
(clone 9A9) were a kind gift from Barry Wolitzky, ChemBridge Research
Laboratories, San Diego, CA. Recombinant human CCL17 and CCL27 was
from R&D Systems.

Ear Skin Microscopy
Epifluorescence video microscopy. CD4+ cells from patients with SS
or CD4+CD45RO+ cells from controls were labeled with CFSE (1 Amol/L;
Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) and injected into anesthetized male C57BL/
6 mice via the right carotid artery (5  107/mL in 50 AL boli of
saline solution). Intravital imaging of dermal vessels was performed
using an IV-500 (Mikron Instruments) as previously described (16).
Scenes were captured from three vessel trees per mouse. In blocking
experiments, the same vessel trees were captured before and after
antibody injection. Rolling and sticking fractions were determined as
previously described (16).
Intravital two-photon microscopy. Ear skin was prepared as described
previously (17). Chemokines (100 ng in 2 AL saline) or saline were injected
intradermally prior to adoptive cell transfer. Carboxy-SNARF-1 (10 Amol/L;
Invitrogen)–labeled SS cells were injected into the carotid artery (108 cells/
mL; 50 AL boli) followed by FITC-labeled Dextran (molecular weight,
500,000 Da; 200 AL of a 2 mg/mL stock) 5 min later. Imaging was performed
on a Prairie Technology Ultima System. For time series, image stacks were

acquired every 25 to 40 s for up to 90 min. Firm adherence was assumed if
cells arrested for more than two consecutive frames. As an independent
measure, the total number of arrested cells in the mouse ear was counted
under epifluorescent light 120 min after injection of chemokines.
Cells were used within 2 h of isolation. All procedures involving
experimental animals were performed under approval by Wistar’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Immunofluorescence Staining
Staining was performed on 7-Am frozen sections from mouse ear skin
with anti-human CD3 (Dako), mouse collagen IV (Chemicon), TCRvh7.1
(Immunotech/Beckman Coulter), and ICAM-1 (Abcam). Sections were
examined using a LSM 520 confocal microscope (Zeiss).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post-test using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software).
P < 0.05 was used as level of significance.

Results and Discussion
Behavior of SS cells in the microvasculature of the mouse
ear. The characteristics of patients with SS and the cells used in
this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Flow cytometry
was used to evaluate the expression of molecules implicated in
T-cell homing to the skin on SS cells as compared with

CD4+CD45RO+ memory T-cells from healthy donors. When
compared with controls, SS cells exhibited similar expression of
CCR4 [67.3 F 10.9% (SS) versus 48.7 F 3.8% (control); P = 0.19],
CCR10 (18.9 F 3.7% versus 13.4 F 1.3%; P = 0.25), E-selectin ligands
(36.5 F 8.0% versus 25.1 F 6.1%; P = 0.38), P-selectin ligands
(42.5 F 8.3% versus 37.7 F 5.5%; P = 0.71), L-selectin (53.3 F 11.8%
versus 53.8 F 7.9%; P = 0.98), CD44 (98.7 F 0.8% versus 99.5 F 0.3%;
P = 0.45), and LFA-1 (96.2 F 1.6% versus 98.9 F 0.4%; P = 0.29).
A significant difference was observed in the expression of a-4
integrin, which was detected in 83.8 F 3.3% of control cells but
only in 13.5 F 3.9% of SS cells (P < 0.0001). Together, SS cells reveal
a similar panel of homing receptors on their surface as memory
T-cells from healthy individuals (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of SS
cell migration to the skin, we tracked CFSE-labeled CD4+ T-cells
from patients with SS or CD4+CD45RO+ memory T-cells from
healthy donors in the dermal microvasculature using epifluorescence video microscopy. In noninflamed dermal vessels, control
cells displayed a rolling fraction of f25%, whereas no sticking
occurred (Fig. 1A). SS cells showed comparable numbers of rollers,
but a higher sticking fraction of 0.5 F 0.4% (Fig. 1A). We have
previously shown that, under homeostatic conditions, leukocytes in
the dermal microvasculature roll in a P-selectin and E-selectin–
dependent manner (16). As shown in Fig. 1B, blocking of murine
P-selectin nearly abolished the number of rolling SS cells as
compared with the isotype antibody (1.8 F 0.6% versus 25.2 F 2.7%;
P < 0.001). Blocking of E-selectin reduced the rolling fraction
to f35% of the control value (9.3 F 3.5% versus 25.2 F 2.7%;
P < 0.01). These data establish a functional role of selectins in
the specific interactions between human CTCL cells and the
dermal vasculature.
Role of CCL17 and CCL27 on the trafficking behavior of SS
cells in the skin. Firm adherence of rolling leukocytes requires a
chemokine-mediated activation of cell surface integrins resulting
in a transition from low to high affinity. To determine the
mechanisms of firm adherence and potential extravasation of SS
cells, we made use of intravital two-photon microscopy (17).
Consistent with the results above, under baseline conditions, SS
cells frequently rolled along postcapillary venules, whereas sticking
was rarely observed [(Figs. 1C and 2A; Supplementary Movie S1A);
note that the sticking fraction is measured here as a percentage of
slow rolling cells, and is thus higher than in Fig. 1A]. Injection of
CCL17 resulted in a 3-fold increase in the number of sticking cells
(81.67 F 6.1% versus 27.7 F 1.7%; P < 0.01; Figs. 1C and 2B;
Supplementary Movie S1B). Notably, in contrast with CCL17,
CCL27 did not increase firm adherence (41.3 F 13.2%; P > 0.05
versus control; Figs. 1C and 2C; Supplementary Movie S1C). In
addition, the combination of both chemokines was not superior
to the injection of CCL17 alone (75.8 F 6.1%; Fig. 1C).
These results were further corroborated by counting the total
number of fluorescent cells in the vascular bed using epifluorescence microscopy 2 hours after the injection of cells. Thus,
CCL17 lead to an increase in the number of arrested cells (116.8 F
18.85 versus 38.5 F 9.2 cells/106 injected cells/ear in the control
group; P < 0.01), whereas CCL27 did not reveal any change (25.8 F
3.9 cells/ear; P > 0.05; Fig. 1D).
Although neither injection of CCL17 nor CCL27 alone was
associated with extravasation of SS cells, the combination of both
chemokines resulted in transmigrating cells as well as extravasated
cells located in the dermis (6.8 F 2.8% of the cells arrested; Fig. 3).
As an independent confirmation of their extravascular localization,

Figure 4. Identification of extravasated SS cells by immunohistology. CCL17
and CCL27 were injected intradermally prior to the adoptive transfer of
SS cells. A and B, frozen sections of ears 4 h after the injection of SS cells
were stained for human CD3 (red ) and murine collagen-IV (green ).

immunofluorescence staining for human CD3 and murine collagen4 was performed. Comparable to intravital imaging, CD3+ cells were
observed in the perivascular tissue (Fig. 4A and B). A mean number
of 5 F 3 cells per section was observed (n = 10 sections).
To ensure that the extravasated cells did not selectively comprise
the remaining CD4+ nontumor cells, we performed costaining for
CD26 and CCR10 on the samples from the patients (patients 6, 7,
and 8) that were used in the extravasation experiments. Eighty-four
percent of all CCR10+ cells were CD26 , demonstrating a
preponderance of malignant CCR10-positive cells. In addition,
extravasated cells from patient 6, in whom 100% of circulating
CD4+ cells expressed vb7.1, stained positively for this TCR (Fig. 4C),
thereby confirming the extravasation of SS cells.
As injection of chemokines could also induce endothelial
activation, and therefore mediate indirect effects on SS cell
recruitment, we assessed ICAM-1 expression on the venular
endothelium. We did not find a significant difference between

sections from saline-injected or CCL27 plus CCL17-injected mice
(data not shown).
Our data show that a combination of CCL17 and CCL27 is
capable of inducing extravasation of SS cells into the dermis,
consistent with a nonredundant function of these chemokines in
CTCL accumulation in the skin. Thus, CCL17 seems to mediate
firm arrest of SS cells in dermal venules, whereas CCL27 is
necessary for their transmigration. One caveat with the
interpretation of these results is that, in our patients, the
percentage of CCR10+ SS cells was lower (f20%) than CCR4expressing cells (f65%). Thus, it may be argued that the lack of
firm adherence of SS cells after CCL27 application could be due
to the lower number of CCR10+ cells. However, it is interesting
to note that both in the case of SS cells and normal memory
CD4+ cells, CCR10 is expressed at much lower levels in
peripheral blood as compared with cells within the skin.
Therefore, a plausible scenario would be that CCR10+ tumor
cells have a selective advantage over CCR4 single positive cells in
their accumulation in the skin.
Prolonged observation of extravasated SS cells showed that they
did not migrate further through the dermis. A possible explanation
could be that the presence of exogenous chemokines interfered
with other promigratory cues in the tissue, or that the SS cells
homed to distinct microniches within the dermis where they
became sessile. Further experimentation will be necessary to
elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.
Taken together, we have established a model for the observation
of the intravascular behavior of Sezary cells as well as their
transmigration across the vessel wall. This has enabled us to define
the specific role of adhesion molecules and chemokines in the
homing of SS cells to the skin, the primary location of CTCL.
Increased understanding of these trafficking pathways may be used
to interfere with the skin homing of CTCL cells.
