Abstract
Exogenous overexpression of the metastasis suppressor gene
Nm23-H1 reduces the metastatic potential of multiple types
of cancer cells and suppresses in vitro tumor cell motility
and invasion. Mutational analysis of Nm23-H1 revealed that
substitution mutants P96S and S120G did not inhibit motility
and invasion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Nm23H1 motility suppression, expression microarray analysis of an
MDA-MB-435 cancer cell line overexpressing wild-type Nm23H1 was done and cross-compared with expression profiles
from lines expressing the P96S and S120G mutants. Nine
genes, MET, PTN, SMO, FZD1, L1CAM, MMP2, NETO2, CTGF,
and EDG2, were down-regulated by wild-type but not by
mutant Nm23-H1 expression. Reduced expression of these
genes coincident with elevated Nm23-H1 expression was
observed in human breast tumor cohorts, a panel of breast
carcinoma cell lines, and hepatocellular carcinomas from
control versus Nm23-M1 knockout mice. The functional
significance of the down-regulated genes was assessed by
transfection and in vitro motility assays. Only EDG2 overexpression significantly restored motility to Nm23-H1–
suppressed cancer cells, enhancing motility by 60-fold in
these cells. In addition, silencing EDG2 expression with small
interfering RNA reduced the motile phenotype of metastatic
breast cancer cells. These data suggest that Nm23-H1
suppresses metastasis, at least in part, through downregulation of EDG2 expression. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7238–46]

Introduction
Nm23-H1 was discovered by its reduced expression in highly
metastatic murine melanoma cell lines compared with congenic,
nonmetastatic lines (1). Exogenous expression of Nm23-H1 has
been shown to reduce metastasis in 11 independent models, which
include melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, ovary, oral cavity,
and colon (2–12). According to its definition as a metastasis
suppressor gene, Nm23-H1 expression reduced the incidence of
metastases without affecting primary tumor size in these models.
The in vivo effect of Nm23 on the metastatic process was recently
bolstered by the characterization of mice lacking the Nm23-M1

gene, the murine homologue of Nm23-H1 (13). The incidence of
lung metastases was significantly higher for the Nm23-M1
knockout mice compared with Nm23-M1+/+ mice, when the mice
were induced to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ref. 14).
Based on its activity in in vitro assays of aspects of metastasis,
Nm23-H1 presumably thwarts the spread of cancer at multiple steps
along the metastatic cascade. Overexpression of Nm23-H1 nearly
abolishes cell motility of MDA-MB-435 cancer cells to multiple
chemoattractants including serum, insulin-like growth factor (IGF),
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), autotaxin, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and reduces their anchorage-independent growth
and invasion (3, 15, 16). In addition, Nm23-H1 overexpression in
MDA-MB-435 cells stimulated aspects of breast differentiation
in vitro (17). Nm23-H1–mediated suppression of in vitro motility,
colonization, and invasion has also been observed for other cell lines,
including the aggressive breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231
and colon and prostate carcinoma cell lines (2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 18).
How Nm23-H1 suppresses metastasis remains an area of intense
research. Most biochemical analyses of Nm23-H1 focused on its
in vitro inhibition of motility as an experimental end point
because the capacity to migrate is a hallmark of metastatic spread.
Although transfection of wild-type Nm23-H1 inhibited MDA-MB435 cell motility, substitution mutants P96S and S120G did not (16).
The histidine protein kinase activity of Nm23-H1 was coordinately
reduced in the P96S and S120G mutants, supporting the hypothesis
that this activity contributed to motility suppression (16, 19).
Nm23-H1 binding to the human PRUNE protein and stimulation of
its phosphodiesterase activity also correlated with its capacity
to suppress MDA-MB-435 cell motility (20). Other activities of
Nm23-H1, such as its nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity and its
putative DNA transactivation, did not correlate with the motility
suppression phenotype (21, 22).
Given the complexity of metastasis, multiple pathways downstream of Nm23-H1 presumably mediate its phenotypic effects.
Here, we report a microarray analysis of gene expression changes in
MDA-MB-435 cells expressing either wild-type or mutant Nm23-H1
compared with control vector. Nine genes encoding for either
secreted factors or cell surface receptors were specifically downregulated by wild-type Nm23-H1 and significantly correlated with
Nm23-H1 gene expression in breast tumor cohort expression data.
Of these genes, only reexpression of the LPA receptor EDG2
restored motility to Nm23-H1–suppressed tumor cells.

with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen). Human breast cancer lines
T47D, SKBr3, BT474, and MCF7, and the human lung fibroblast line MRC5,
were maintained as described by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Human lung fibroblasts NHLF were maintained as described by Cambrex.
Cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC to f85% confluency
before harvesting for experiments.
Microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform and purified according to the RNeasy
midiprep spin kit protocol (Qiagen). Oligo microarray chips were generated
from the 34,580 longmer probe set Human Genome Oligo Set Version 3.0
(Qiagen). Dried oligos, resuspended in 3 SSC solution, were spotted to
epoxy-coated slides. Slides were cleaned by vigorous shaking in a 0.5% SDS
solution for 2 min, incubated in a 50jC waterbath for 20 min, and dried by
centrifugation. Protocols for cDNA labeling, hybridization, and scanning are
available through the National Human Genome Research Institute microarray core.6 Three replicate hybridizations of C-100 v H1-177 samples were
done and four replicate experiments each were done for C-100 v S-22 and
C-100 v I-205 samples. Microarray data can be obtained via the Gene
Expression Omnibus repository, accession no. GSE7549.7 Raw intensities for
Cy3 and Cy5 channels were normalized and data were filtered by
eliminating array elements with a quality score below 0.5 and a total
intensity of <100. Median Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each element were
determined from the replicate experiments. The log10 of the ratio of the
medians for each element was calculated and a Student’s t test was done to
determine statistical confidence. Microarray elements with P < 0.05 and
log10 ratios z0.23 were deemed differentially expressed compared with
C-100 background.
Semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
was done using total RNA isolated from C-100, H1-177, S-22, and I-205 cells.
Reverse transcription was done according to protocol with SuperScript III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR conditions were
optimized for gene oligo pairs (Supplementary Table S1) and analyzed by
gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. qRT-PCR was done with
an iQ5 Multicolor Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using
standard techniques. The relative gene expression value of each gene was
calculated by the standard curve of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) relative quantitation with C-100 cDNA.
Establishment of stable cell lines. The coding sequences of Nm23-H1,
Nm23-H1-P96S, and Nm23-H1-S120G, previously cloned into pCDNA3.1,
were subcloned into pCDNA3.1_Zeocin (Invitrogen) and sequence verified.
MDA-MB-435 cells were selected for stable transfection of pCDNA3.1_Zeo,
Nm23-H1_Zeo, P96S_Zeo, and S120G_Zeo, and MDA-MB-231 cells were
selected for stable transfection of pCDNA3.1_Zeocin and Nm23-H1_Zeocin
using standard procedures for Effectene (Qiagen). Single clones were
selected in medium containing Zeocin (Invitrogen) and screened for Nm23H1expression.
Immunoblotting. Lysates were prepared as described (23) and protein
concentration was determined by a BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Equivalent
amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
Hybond C-Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then probed with anti–Nm23-H1/H2 (Chemicon), anti–Nm23H1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), anti-tubulin (Oncogene), anti-MET (Cell
Signaling), anti-EDG2 (Abcam), anti-SMO (Abcam), anti-PTN (Oncogene),
anti-CTGF (R&D Systems), anti-L1CAM (Abcam), anti-MMP2 (Novus
Biologicals), anti-CD44 (Abcam), anti-SPP1 (Novus Biologicals), anti-RSK1
(Chemicon), anti-histone H2B (Cell Signaling), anti-EDG4 (Abgent), antihemagglutinin (Covance), and anti–FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma).
Relative protein expression was determined by spot densitometry.
Statistical correlation to breast tumor cohorts microarray data.
Microarray expression data from the van’t veer et al. (24) breast tumor
cohort and the Perou et al. (25) cohort is publicly available. Tumor samples

were ranked by the log10 of the normalized ratio for the Nm23-H1 gene
element and cohorts were cut in half into tumors with ‘‘high’’ Nm23-H1
expression and ‘‘low’’ Nm23-H1 expression. To determine significance of the
expression of a given gene to Nm23-H1 gene expression, a Student’s t test
and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was done on the normalized ratio or the log10
of the normalized ratio of expression for its representative microarray
element for the given gene in the low and high Nm23-H1 tumor sets.
Scatterplots were constructed and trend lines were estimated in Microsoft
Excel.
Gene silencing. Nm23-H1 expression was diminished in SKBr3 cells by
transfection with pGENEClip containing either NME1-1 and NME1-2 short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs against Nm23-H1 coding sequence
(SuperArray Bioscience) with standard Effectene procedures. Five days
posttransfection, cells were collected and lysed.
For EDG2 silencing, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA designed against the coding sequence of
EDG2, available from Dharmacon, using HiPerfect (Qiagen). Transfection
efficiency was monitored by siGLO, and siCONTROL, a nontargeting small
interfering RNA (siRNA) pool, served as a negative control.
Immunohistochemistry. Liver tissues were obtained from ASV/Nm23M1+/+ and ASV/Nm23-M1 / mice as described in Boissan et al. (14) and
embedded in paraffin blocks. Blocks were sliced into 4-Am sections and
mounted to silanized glass slides. Sections were prepared and stained by
immunohistochemistry as previously described (26). The following primary
antibodies were used: anti–Nm23-H1 (14), anti-EDG2 (Novus Biologicals),
anti-MET (R&D Systems), anti–NCAM-L1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies),
antipleiotrophin (R&D Systems), and anti-Smo (Abcam). Stained sections
were examined microscopically at 400 magnification in consultation with
a pathologist.
Cloning and expression of Nm23-H1–regulated genes. Seven genes
were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen)
by PCR amplification with primers containing restriction enzyme adapter
sequences, standard restriction enzyme digest, gel extraction, ligation, and
transformation procedures (see Supplementary Table S2 for oligo sequences). EDG2, PTN, and L1CAM were amplified from clones available from
ATCC and MMP2 was amplified from a clone that was a gift from L.
Matrisian (Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville,
TN). FZD1, SMO, and NETO2 were amplified from a human placental cDNA
library (Stratagene) and were simultaneously tagged using oligos containing
linker epitopes. The CTGF and MET expression constructs were previously
described (27, 28) and the EDG4 expression construct is available through
ATCC. Constructs were transfected into H1-177 cells using standard
Effectene (Qiagen) protocols.
Boyden chamber assays. Cell migration assays were done essentially as
described (16). Lower wells contained DMEM plus 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) with or without 0.1% FBS, 1% FBS, and 5 Amol/L LPA (Sigma).
Cells (1  105) were added to each upper well in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA and
incubated in a humidified chamber at 37jC, 5% CO2. Cells were fixed and
stained with Diff-Quik solutions (Dade-Behring). Cells that had migrated to
the undersurface of the membrane were examined microscopically at 100
magnification. Each condition was assayed in triplicate wells and
representative areas of each well were counted to determine the number
of cells that had migrated. Statistical differences were calculated by a
Student’s t test and each experiment was repeated at least twice.
Matrigel invasion assay. NHLF and MRC5 cells were grown to 70%
confluency, washed, and serum starved in DMEM containing 1 mg/mL BSA.
Conditioned medium was collected and applied as a chemoattractant.
C-100 and H1-177 transfected cells were grown to 85% confluency and
4  105 cells were applied to BD-Biocoat Matrigel-coated invasion
chambers (BD Biosciences). Assays were incubated for 40 h at 37jC, 5%
CO2. Cells that invaded through the Matrigel to the other side of the 8-Am
porous membrane were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik solutions (DadeBehring). The membranes were subsequently attached to a glass slide,
examined microscopically at 100 magnification. Each cell condition was
assayed in triplicate chambers and the entire membrane was counted for
invading cells. Statistical significance was calculated by a Student’s t test
and each experiment was done twice.

Results
Genes differentially regulated in wild-type versus mutant
Nm23-H1–expressing lines. The H1-177 cell line expressed 9-fold
higher levels of Nm23-H1 and exhibited reduced motility in vitro
and metastasis in vivo compared with vector transfectant, C-100
(3). Two stable MDA-MB-435–derived cell lines expressing mutant
Nm23-H1 proteins, P96S and S120G (termed S-22 and I-205,
respectively), exhibited motility levels not significantly different
from vector transfectants (22). Immunoblot analysis of these cell
lines showed that the Nm23-H1 transfectants retained higher levels
of Nm23-H1 protein relative to the C-100 line (Fig. 1A). In
chemotactic assays, stable transfection of wild-type Nm23-H1
reduced cell migration by f30-fold and 14-fold to 0.1% and 1%
FBS, respectively (P = 0.002 and P = 0.03, respectively). Cell
migration of the S-22 and I-205 cells was not statistically different
from the control vector–transfected cell line at either concentration of FBS (Fig. 1B). These data confirmed the correlation of
Nm23-H1 mutational status and inhibition of in vitro motility for
the cell passages used herein.
A microarray gene expression analysis of the H1-177 and mutant
S-22 and I-205 cells compared with C-100 cells was done. A
significant difference in expression between the wild-type and at
least one mutant was determined for 70 genes by a Student’s t test

(Supplementary Table S3). These differentially expressed genes
either alone or in combination may contribute to Nm23-H1–
mediated motility suppression.
Validation of microarray analysis. To validate the microarray
results, semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR was done on a
subset of the Nm23-H1–regulated genes. Of 23 genes tested, 19
showed identical trends in all four stable cell lines when compared
with the microarray data (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1 and data
not shown). These genes include MET, CTGF, EDG2, FZD1, L1CAM,
PTN, SMO, SPP1, and MRGX genes and histone genes. Expression of
EDG2 was nearly undetectable in the H1-177 line by these methods,
but was expressed at levels comparable with C-100 in the S-22 and
I-205 mutant lines. Similarly, MET, L1CAM, PTN, and NETO2
expression was reduced in the H1-177 line, but not in S-22 and
I-205 when compared with control transfectant, C-100. The four
genes that failed to reproduce observed microarray trends, MAP2,
NCAM, CCL20, and Nm23-H2, all exhibited divergent expression
patterns in the S-22 cell line only.
The corresponding protein levels for 11 Nm23-H1–regulated
genes was determined by immunoblot analysis using lysates
from the same stable cell lines (Fig. 1D). The trends in protein
levels in all four cell lines precisely matched the trends observed in
the microarray analysis for nine differentially expressed genes:
MET, EDG2, L1CAM, SMO, CTGF, PTN, MMP2, CD44, and SPP1.

Nm23-H1–Mediated Motility Suppression

Figure 2. Correlation between Nm23-H1 gene expression and Nm23-H1 –regulated gene expression in microarray data of a breast tumor cohort. A, top left, breast
tumors represented in the van’t Veer et al. (24) microarray data set were ranked by their relative log10 expression level of the Nm23-H1 gene and arbitrarily split into
two groups: high Nm23-H1–expressing tumors and low Nm23-H1 –expressing tumors. B to D, relative log10 expression of the EDG2, FZD1 , and Nm23-H2 genes
were plotted against the relative log10 expression of Nm23-H1 , and a trend line was determined.

In contrast to the microarray and RT-PCR analysis, RSK1 and
Histone H2B protein levels in the S-22 and I-205 lysates were
comparable with that observed in the H1-177 lysates. Notably,
EDG2 does not migrate as a single, clean band, presumably due to
posttranslational modifications. Three antibodies against EDG2
have yielded similar immunoblot results (data not shown).
To refute the possibility that the observed trends in protein
levels were the result of clonal variation and not Nm23-H1
expression, an independent set of MDA-MB-435 transfectant cell
lines was established. The level of Nm23-H1 expression and the
migratory capacity of these lines paralleled that observed for the
original clonal lines (Supplementary Fig. S2 and data not shown).
Identical protein expression patterns were observed for MET,
L1CAM, and EDG2 in these newly established lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Although SMO and PTN levels were lower in the Nm23H1_Zeo line compared with vector control as expected, their
relative levels in the P96S_Zeo and S120G_Zeo lines were different
from that observed in the original S-22 and I-205 lines.
Nm23-H1–regulated genes with relevance to breast cancer.
To refine the set of genes linked to Nm23-H1 motility inhibition to
genes with putative clinical relevance, the expression of these genes
was correlated to Nm23-H1 gene expression in two published
breast tumor cohorts: the van’t Veer et al. (24) and the Perou et al.
(25) data sets. The van’t Veer cohort contains 120 breast tumors
and the Perou cohort consists of 60 tumors. Each study measured
relative gene expression of bulk tumor tissue by microarrays
consisting of f24,500 elements and 9,200 elements, respectively.
To determine statistical significance between Nm23-H1 and
downstream genes, cohorts were divided into two groups: highexpressing and low-expressing Nm23-H1 tumors, shown pictorially

www.aacrjournals.org

in Fig. 2A for the van’t Veer cohort. The fold ratio of expression of
all 70 Nm23-H1–regulated genes that were differentially expressed
in at least one of the mutant cell lines were assessed for
significance between the high- and low-expressing Nm23-H1
groups with a Student’s t test and a nonparametric rank-sum
analysis (Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 2B–D).
Expression of 14 Nm23-H1–regulated genes significantly correlated with Nm23-H1 expression in the van’t Veer cohort and nine
genes correlated with Nm23-H1 in the Perou cohort (Supplementary
Table S4). Only three genes overlap between the cohorts, primarily
because a number of genes are not represented on the Perou
microarray. Six genes exhibited a significant relationship in one
cohort, but no correlation in the other. These discrepancies may be
explained by differences in the patient cohorts as the van’t Veer
cohort represents a younger population (median age of 44 versus 64
for the Perou cohort) or differences in stromal tissue contamination
in the collected tumors. Regardless, this analysis showed that the
observed patterns of gene expression corresponding to Nm23-H1
motility suppression can be found in clinical breast tumors and
refine the list of Nm23-H1–regulated genes to 20 genes with putative
clinical relevance. These genes include MET, EDG2, L1CAM, SMO,
and PTN, which all negatively correlate with Nm23-H1 expression.
Correlation of Nm23-H1–regulated genes to metastatic
potential and Nm23-H1 expression in a panel of breast carcinoma cell lines. The gene expression patterns relative to Nm23-H1
were next shown to be germane to a breast cancer cell line model.
The expression of Nm23-H1, MET, EDG2, L1CAM, SMO, and PTN was
assessed by immunoblot analysis in a panel of human breast cancer
cell lines with variable metastatic capacities. As shown in Fig. 3A,

and SKBr3 have high levels of the Nm23-H1 protein, comparable
with levels observed in H1-177 cells, whereas the metastatic lines
MDA-MB-435, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231 have low levels of this
metastasis suppressor. MET, EDG2, SMO, and PTN exhibited an
inverse correlation with Nm23-H1 and thus a positive correlation
with metastatic capacity in all lines tested, in contrast to L1CAM.

Next, Nm23-H1 was overexpressed in the metastatic MDA-MB231 human breast carcinoma cell line to determine its effect on
Nm23-H1–regulated gene expression. Lysates were prepared from
two vector-control cell lines (3 and 6) and three Nm23-H1–
expressing lines (22, 28, and 38) and immunoblot analysis was
done. MET, EDG2, L1CAM, SMO, and PTN levels were all diminished
in the Nm23-H1–overexpressing clones relative to vector control
(Fig. 3B). Thus, the Nm23-H1–related variations in gene expression
observed in MDA-MB-435 cells seem to be reproducible in a human
breast carcinoma cell line.
Alternatively, it was hypothesized that silencing Nm23-H1
expression would enhance expression of EDG2 and MET in an
independent cell line expressing high endogenous levels of Nm23H1 protein. SKBr3 cells were transiently transfected with two
Nm23-H1 shRNA constructs or an empty vector control and the
expression of Nm23-H1, EDG2, and MET determined by immunoblot. Transfection of Nm23-H1 shRNA 1 and 2 resulted, respectively,
in a 2.2- and 2.4-fold reduction in Nm23-H1 protein in SKBr3 cells
relative to transfection of the vector control (Fig. 3C). Proportional
increases in EDG2 and MET were observed when Nm23-H1 levels
were reduced.
Enhanced levels of EDG2, MET, L1CAM, and PTN in Nm23M1 / mouse HCC. Nm23-M1 is the murine homologue of
Nm23-H1. An Nm23-M1 knockout mouse has recently been
characterized in the context of metastatic disease. Nm23-M1 /
mice induced to form HCC with transgenic expression of
simian virus large T antigen (ASV) have a much higher incidence
of pulmonary metastasis compared with Nm23-M1+/+ mice
similarly induced (14). Genes identified as Nm23-H1 regulated
might contribute to the metastatic spread observed in the
knockout mouse. To test this hypothesis, the relative protein
levels of a number of genes down-regulated by Nm23-H1 were
determined in ASV/Nm23-M1+/+ and ASV/Nm23-M1 / mice by
immunohistochemistry.
Regions of hepatocellular transformation in ASV/Nm23-M1 /
and ASV/Nm23-M1+/+ liver were identified in H&E-stained
sections, in consultation with a pathologist. Induction with ASV
resulted in transformation of much of the liver tissue of both the
/ and +/+ mice. As expected, Nm23-M1 staining was more
intense in HCC from ASV/Nm23-M1+/+ mice compared with null
mice (Fig. 4). Side-by-side comparison of HCC regions from the null
and wild-type mice revealed that EDG2, MET, L1CAM, and PTN

cells compared with ASV/Nm23-M1+/+ HCC and micrographs of
two such regions from both the wild-type and null mice are represented in Fig. 4. Very little SMO staining was detected in the liver
sections of mice with either genotype. In experiments not shown,
EDG2 and MET protein levels were further validated in HCC sections from six ASV/Nm23-M1 / and six ASV/Nm23-M1+/+ mice.
EDG2 restores in vitro cell motility to Nm23-H1–overexpressing
cancer cells. To determine the functional effect that differential
expression of these genes might have on Nm23-H1–mediated
motility suppression, genes down-regulated by Nm23-H1 were
cloned into a mammalian expression vector and their capacity to
restore cell motility to wild-type Nm23-H1–overexpressing
H1-177 cells was assayed in a Boyden chamber. MET, FZD1, SMO,
EDG2, MMP2, L1CAM, NETO2, PTN, and CTGF constructs were
transiently transfected into H1-177 cells and their expression was
monitored by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A). Figure 5B summarizes
the results of these transfections on H1-177 cell motility assayed in
response to 1% FBS over 16 h. Most transfected genes exhibited no
motility enhancing activity in H1-177 cells. However, exogenous
overexpression of EDG2 stimulated a 60-fold increase in motility in
response to serum (P = 0.0008). This increase in cell number cannot
be attributed to enhanced proliferation as comparable increases were
observed when motility was assayed over 4 h (data not shown).
The only other gene that significantly enhanced the motility of
the H1-177 cells was MET, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
receptor gene, which stimulated motility only 2-fold to serum
(P = 0.008) and 4-fold to HGF (data not shown).
EDG2 is a G-protein coupled receptor that mediates LPA
signaling. When pure LPA was used as a chemoattractant in the
Boyden chamber motility assay, migration of EDG2-transfected
H1-177 cells was not enhanced beyond that observed for serum,
presumably because LPA is a major component of serum (Fig. 5C).
EDG2 also stimulated an increase in motility of H1-177 cells in the
absence of a chemoattractant (BSA; Fig. 5B–C). This background
migration may be attributed to the cell secretion of autotaxin,
which converts fatty acids in BSA into the lipid mediator LPA, as
fatty acid free BSA dramatically reduced this background motility

www.aacrjournals.org

(data not shown). Interestingly, overexpression of EDG2 in H1-177
cells also stimulated motility to HGF and heregulin by 8.6- and
6.8-fold above vector control transfectants (P = 0.0003 and 0.021,
respectively) in the presence of fatty acid–free BSA. Although EDG2
transfection induced cell migration, it did not restore motility to
the extent observed for C-100 cells (Fig. 5C). This incomplete
restoration could represent an artifact of transient transfection.
A major site of breast cancer metastasis is the lung. To better
simulate in vivo conditions for metastasis, we assessed tumor cell
invasion in response to lung fibroblast-conditioned medium.
Conditioned medium from MRC5 and NHLF cells was used as a
chemoattractant to determine the capacity of EDG2 to prompt
invasion through Matrigel. H1-177 cells transfected with EDG2
promoted invasion of the H1-177 cells, 12-fold over control
transfectants (P = 0.00007; Fig. 5D).
EDG2 is essential for the motility of metastatic cancer cells.
We next sought to determine if EDG2 expression was essential for
tumor cell migration. Expression of EDG2 was inhibited by
transfection of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells by a siRNA
against EDG2 coding sequence (siEDG2), and its reduced expression
was monitored by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6A). Compared with
transfection of a control siRNA, siCONTROL, siEDG2 reduced the
motility of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells by f70%
(P = 0.002 and P = 0.0002, respectively; Fig. 6B). siEDG2 did not
completely diminish cell motility, presumably because transient
transfection of siRNA does not completely abolish EDG2 expression
in all cells. Of note, transient transfection of Nm23-H1 in these cells
resulted in a comparable reduction in migration.
A second possibility is that another LPA receptor compensated
for reduced EDG2 levels. Four human LPA receptors have been
identified, which include homologues EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7 and
nonhomologous GPR23 (29–32). EDG4 has been reported to have
the highest affinity for LPA (33). EDG4 mRNA expression was not
significantly different in the H1-177 cells compared with C-100 cells
and hybridization was below the threshold of detection for the
oligo corresponding to the 3¶ region of the EDG7 gene for both
channels. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from both sets of

MDA-MB-435–derived clonal cell lines confirmed similar expression levels for EDG4 between Nm23-H1– and vector-transfected
cell lines (data not shown).
As a complementary approach, the capacity of EDG4 expression
to restore motility to H1-177 cells was determined by a Boyden
chamber assay. Although EDG4 enhanced the motility of these
cells f10-fold (P = 0.004), it was not nearly as effective as EDG2
transfection, despite similar levels of overexpression (a 4-fold
increase for EDG2 versus a 3.5-fold increase in EDG4; Fig. 6C–D).
Therefore, restoration of a motility phenotype to H1-177 cells
seems to specifically require the LPA receptor EDG2.

Discussion
Nm23-H1 has been implicated in multiple aspects of cancer
spread—it inhibits tumor cell motility, invasion, and anchorageindependent growth, as well as prompting tumor cell differentiation. Given its complicated array of phenotypes, the molecular
mechanism of Nm23-H1–mediated metastasis suppression is likely
complex, involving the coordinated regulation of multiple genes
and pathways. As a step toward comprehensively delineating
the genes involved in this process, we identified a set of genes
dependent on functional, motility suppressive Nm23-H1 in an
aggressive cancer cell line, MDA-MB-435.
Much of the characterization of Nm23-H1 activity and the
analysis of the molecular basis of breast cancer metastasis have

been done in the MDA-MB-435 cell line. This cell line is controversial as some reports have indicated that it may have been
confused with the M14 melanoma cell line at some point (34, 35).
However, MDA-MB-435 cells have been shown to produce milk
lipid droplets upon induction of differentiation, and Nm23-H1
overexpression itself has been shown to stimulate the hallmarks
of breast differentiation in these cells (17, 36). Moreover, this line
consistently forms spontaneous metastases when implanted into
the mouse mammary fat pad. Regardless, it is still a valuable and
well-characterized model of metastatic progression.
Gene expression analysis in this model system revealed that the
expression of nearly 200 genes is dependent on Nm23-H1. The list
of Nm23-H1–regulated genes was refined to those with functional
relevance to metastasis by two methods. First, we capitalized on
the finding that the P96S and S120G mutants of Nm23-H1 do not
suppress motility and cross-compared the expression profiles of
wild-type and mutant Nm23-H1–expressing cell lines. Second, this
subset of genes was correlated with Nm23-H1 expression in two
published microarray data sets of breast tumor cohorts. Although
this analysis is somewhat limited given that not much gene overlap
was observed between the cohorts (Supplementary Table S4) and
Nm23-H1 gene expression only showed a trend with patient
survival (P = 0.06, data not shown), it sufficiently narrowed the list
of genes to nine that had an inverse correlation to Nm23-H1. Strong
correlations between the expression of a number these genes and
Nm23-H1 expression were exhibited in vivo in the Nm23-M1

knockout mouse model of HCC and in vitro in a panel of breast
carcinoma cell lines exhibiting differential metastatic propensities.
The expression of the LPA receptor EDG2 inversely correlated
with Nm23-H1 expression in all of these models and more
importantly, overexpression of this receptor restored a motile
and invasive phenotype to Nm23-H1–suppressed tumor cells. EDG2
transfection stimulated an astonishing 60-fold increase in the
motility of these cells. To date, only two other genes have
significantly abrogated the motility-suppressive phenotype of
Nm23-H1-PRUNE and EBNA3C, and these genes only enhanced
motility 2- and 3-fold, respectively (20, 37). Both are Nm23-H1
binding proteins and may sequester Nm23-H1 rather than
participate in its mechanistic pathway. The data reported herein
identify for the first time a protein that overcomes the suppression
of motility at points downstream of Nm23-H1.
EDG2 may largely explain the motile phenotype of metastatic
MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells as silencing this gene
severely inhibits the motility of these cells. In addition, LPA and
serum, which contains high LPA titers, are the most potent
chemoattractants of MDA-MB-435 cells, enhancing motility 50- to
200-fold above background compared with the 6- to 7-fold
increases observed for other growth factors, which include HGF,
heregulin, IGF, and PDGF (15). Interestingly, EDG2 expression
is capable of stimulating motility in Nm23-H1–suppressed cells,
albeit to a lesser extent, in LPA-limiting conditions, such as in the
absence of chemoattractant or with HGF and heregulin. EDG2
may stimulate this observed motility either by facilitating

www.aacrjournals.org

signaling through other receptors or by responding to cellular
secretions of autotaxin, the phospholipase involved in LPA
biosynthesis (38, 39).
The functional contribution of EDG2 to in vivo metastasis
will be determined in future experiments, but several lines of
evidence suggest that LPA and EDG2 play an important role in
the promotion of metastasis. LPA levels are significantly
increased in malignant effusions and exogenous expression of
autotaxin promotes metastasis in nude mice (40–42). Similarly,
in an orthotopic ovarian tumor model, LPA supplied through
microosmotic pumps enhanced the incidence of metastases
(43, 44). Up-regulation of autotaxin and LPA receptor genes has
been noted in some cancers, including breast cancer (39, 45, 46).
More poignantly, EDG2 overexpression prompted bone metastasis of the breast cancer cell line MDA-BO2 in xenograft
experiments (47, 48). Down-regulation of this receptor by the
metastasis suppressor Nm23-H1 is critical for motility suppression and may therefore be important for the suppression of
in vivo metastasis.
