Abstract
Like many signaling pathways in development, the Notch receptor pathway plays an important role in
cancer pathobiology when it is dysregulated. Potential ligand-binding sites within the epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats of Notch1 have been identified, but the ligand-binding domains in Notch3, which is
implicated in lung cancer, are not known. In screening a library of 155 peptides representing all 34 EGF-like
repeats in Notch3, we discovered two distinct ligand-binding regions involving the 7–10 and 21–22 repeats
that are distinct from the putative ligand-binding domain of Notch1. In cell-based assays, peptides from these
regions induced apoptosis and reduced expression of the Notch3-dependent gene Hey1. They also bound
directly to the Notch ligand Jagged1, suggesting that their mechanism of action involves disrupting interactions between Notch3 and Jagged1. Recombinant Fc fusion peptides engineered for in vivo testing
showed that the Notch3 peptides defined could trigger apoptosis and suppress tumor growth in tumor
xenograft assays. These findings rationalize a mechanistic approach to lung cancer treatment based on
Notch3 receptor–targeted therapeutic development. Cancer Res; 70(2); 632–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Notch3 is a type I transmembrane receptor belonging to a
family of proteins essential for cellular differentiation and
embryonic development. In mammals, there are four Notch
receptors (Notch1–Notch4) and two families of ligands,
Jagged (Jagged1 and Jagged2) and Delta-like (Dll1, Dll3, and
Dll4). Binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain (ECD)
of the Notch receptor triggers two successive proteolytic
cleavages and untethers the Notch intracellular domain
(ICD) from the cytoplasmic membrane. The Notch ICD is
then translocated to the nucleus, binds to the transcription
factor CSL, and induces expression of target genes. These
genes include the hairy-enhancer of split (Hes) and hairy
and enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif (Hey) families.
Activation of the Notch pathway depends on the interaction of the ECD between the ligand and the receptor with
subsequent release of the activated ICD. Notch3 is a large
protein containing 2,321 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 243.66 kDa. The Notch3 ECD, a region containing the ligand recognition site, is estimated to be 210 kDa.
Identifying the part within the large ECD important for
receptor-ligand interaction will help to better understand
the biology of Notch3 signaling and therapeutic design. Using

deletion mutants and point mutations of Drosophila Notch
and mammalian Notch1, the identified ligand-binding site
seems to involve epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like repeats
11–12 (1, 2). However, given the functional diversity and the
variation in tissue distribution among the different Notch
family members, we hypothesized that the targetable ligand
recognition sites on Notch3 receptor differ from those of
other family members.
Notch3 is overexpressed in ∼40% of resected non–small
cell lung cancers, and its suppression results in loss of the
malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo (3, 4). In both
development and cancer, Notch has been shown to cross-talk
with oncogenic pathways such as the EGF receptor/ras/
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (3, 5–7). Thus, targeting this pathway represents a rational strategy in the
treatment of patients with lung cancer. One approach currently being explored in clinical trials is blocking the essential
proteolytic processing of Notch receptors with γ-secretase
inhibitors. The efficacy of this class of compounds needs
exploring, but the relative lack of target specificity suggests
that new more specific strategies targeting this pathway
should be pursued.
In this study, we identify the domains within Notch3 ECD
important for ligand recognition and binding. Using a highthroughput system and a Notch3 peptide library, we discovered two previously unknown regions, EGF-like repeats 7–10
and 21–22, important for Notch3 activation. In addition, we
showed that interfering peptides and recombinant proteins
mimicking these regions can abrogate Notch3 activation, induce apoptosis, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The findings of the present study not only give novel insights into
Notch3 signaling but also establish a foundation on which
targeted therapy can be developed.

Targeting Notch3-Ligand Interaction in Lung Cancer

Materials and Methods
Peptide library. The peptide library consisted of 155 synthetic peptides. Their sequences were 5 to 15 amino acids in
length and spanned nearly the entire Notch3 ECD. Each peptide represented a unique extracellular site on the ECD, with
peptide 1 representing the NH2 terminus and peptide 155 representing the COOH terminus of the last EGF-like repeat.
They were synthesized by SynPep and diluted in deionized
H2O to bring the concentration to ∼10 mg/mL of peptide
in 1× PBS. The peptides were biotinylated using E-Z Link Biotin BMCC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in PBS at a molar
ratio of approximately 1 to 2 moles of biotin per mole of synthetic peptide for immunofluorescence staining and pulldown assays.
Cell culture and inhibitor. The Notch3-expressing lung
cancer cell line HCC2429 was established as previously described (8). HEK293T and HeLa cells were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in
DMEM with 10% FCS. MRK003 was provided by Merck,
Inc. & Co., and its formulation was described previously (9).
Apoptosis screen of peptide library. Both HCC2429 and
HeLa cells were seeded onto 384-well plates at 3,000 in 50
μL per well. Twenty-five microliters of Annexin V–Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen, Inc.), diluted 1:2,200 in RPMI 1640 and 10
μL of peptide (diluted to 0.1 mg/mL in RPMI 1640), were
added. After an overnight incubation, the treated cells were
analyzed with a FMAT 8100 HTS System fluorescent plate
reader (Applied Biosystems). Each peptide was assayed in
quadruplicate.
Notch3 deletion mutants. With the Notch3 ECD as template, inverse PCR was used to generate deletions of Notch3
EGF-like repeats 7–10 and EGF 21–22. The ECD containing
the deletions was confirmed by DNA sequencing, cloned into
pcDNA4, and religated to Notch3 intracellular fragment to
generate full-length Notch3 deletion mutants.
In vitro pull-down assay. HEK293T cells were transfected
with hemagglutinin (HA)–tagged Jagged1 (provided by Dr.
Artavanis-Tsakonas, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA)
using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were lysed in NP40
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% NP40 plus 50 mmol/L protease inhibitors]. One microgram of biotin-labeled peptides and streptavidin-conjugated
magnetic beads (Promega) was used to pull down HA-tagged
Jagged1. The resulting proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE
and detected with an anti-HA antibody. For the Fc fusion
protein binding assay, 5 μg of Fc fusion protein and protein
A agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) were used.
Immunofluorescent staining assay. HCC2429 and
HEK293T cells were plated on glass chamber slides. After
24 h, the cells were rinsed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and treated with 1 mL of biotin-labeled peptides and 0.5 μg/mL of Alexa Fluor 488–labeled streptavidin
(Invitrogen). TO-PRO3 (Invitrogen) was used for nuclear
staining. The cells were then examined under confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Antibodies. Notch3 and HA-targeted Jagged1 were detected using a rabbit Notch3 antibody (Orbigen, Inc.) and

www.aacrjournals.org

an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA-7; Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, at 1:1,000 dilution. The goat anti-human IgGhorseradish peroxidase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.) and the mouse anti–β-tubulin monoclonal antibody
(AA2; Millipore) at 1:5,000 dilution were used to detect human Fc fusion protein and β-tubulin, respectively.
Fc fusion protein expression. The peptide DNA sequences
were cloned into the NH2 terminus of pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 and
pFUSE-mIgG1-Fc2 vectors (Invivogen). These vectors produce secreted fusion protein in mammalian cells. The plasmids were then transiently expressed in HEK293E, and the
proteins were purified from culture medium with a protein
A/G column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The eluted Fc
fusion proteins were equilibrated with PBS buffer using a
HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from HCC2429
or HeLa cells 24 h after peptide treatment or transfection
with deletion mutants using the Qiagen RNase Mini kit.
RNA was reverse transcribed with the SuperScript II FirstStrand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and quantitated using the
iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad)
and QuantiTect SYBR Green reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) kit (Qiagen). Annealing temperature for PCR was 58°C
with the following primers: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′
(sense) and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′ (antisense); Hey1, 5′-AGATGACCGTGGATCACCTG-3′ (sense)
and 5′-TGTTGAGAGCGAAACCAGTC-3′ (antisense); and
Hes1, 5′-AGAAGGCGGACATTCTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′GAGTGCGCACCTCGGTATTA-3′ (antisense). The threshold
cycle value (Ct) was determined with iCycler Optical system
interface software. Mean Ct of Hey1 or Hes1 was calculated
from triplicate measurements and normalized with the mean
Ct of the gene GAPDH as internal control.
Apoptosis assay. HCC2429 cells were treated with peptides or Fc fusion proteins for 24 h and maintained in

In vivo tumorigenicity. HCC2429 cells (1 × 10 6 ) suspended in 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected s.c.
into hind limbs of athymic 4- to 6-wk-old female nude mice
(nu+/nu+). When the tumors were palpable, the mice were
treated with Fc control or with a single loading dose of recombinant protein at 15 mg/kg followed by dose of 10 mg/kg
every 3 d. The tumor size was measured every 3 d with a
caliper. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula:
volume = (length) × (width)2/2.
Statistical analyses. The size of implanted tumors at different time intervals after treatment was compared with that
of control treated with mouse Fc. Unless specifically stated,
statistical inference in comparative experiments both in vivo
and in vitro was obtained using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. For

Results
Peptide library screening identifies potential ligandbinding sites. Notch receptors differ in the number of tandem EGF-like repeats in the ECD. Notch3 contains 34 EGFlike repeats, whereas Notch1 possesses 36. In contrast to
Notch1, the ligand-binding site for Notch3 is not as well characterized. Therefore, to identify Notch3-binding sites, we created a peptide library consisting of 155 short peptides
sequences, 5 to 15 amino acids in length, spanning the entire
34 EGF-like repeats within the Notch3 ECD. Because inhibition of Notch3 induces apoptosis in tumor cells, the conjugated carrier peptides were then screened for the ability to
induce apoptosis. Of the 155 peptides, we identified 15 peptides with reproducible apoptosis-promoting activities in

both HCC2429 and HeLa cells (Table 1). The effect on apoptosis by these peptides was dose dependent (Fig. 1A and B).
Interestingly, the locations of these peptides mapped to two
discrete regions, EGF-like repeats 7–10 and 21–22 (Fig. 1C).
The amino acid sequences from Notch3 repeats 7–10 are
most similar to Notch1 EGF-like repeats 8–11 with 79% identity (data not shown). When we compared the Notch3 sequence with that from putative Notch1 ligand-binding sites,
the EGF-like repeats 11–13, only 40% identity was observed,
suggesting that the Notch3-binding domain differs from that
of Notch1. An example of the alignment between Notch3
EGF-like repeat 7 and Notch 1 EGF-like repeat 11 is shown
in Fig. 1D.

The highly conserved class II EGF-like repeat is observed
in all Notch receptors, and its secondary structure contains a
core with a β-pleated sheet, three disulfide bonds, and a series
of loops (10). At this time, only the structure of the class II
EGF-like domain from human Notch1 is known. Because
Notch3 also contains class II EGF-like repeats, we mapped
the Notch3 peptides with proapoptotic-promoting activity
to the class II consensus sequence (PDB ID: 2VJ3). Interestingly, the peptide sequences mapped to the loop regions of
the EGF-like repeats, suggesting that the loop regions are
responsible for ligand interaction. Molecular visualizations
of the relative positions of N17 and N132 peptides within an
EGF-like repeat are shown in Fig. 1E (blue).

Figure 3. Notch3 Fc fusion proteins bind to Jagged1 and inhibit Notch3 activation. A, transfection of Notch3 Fc fusion expression plasmids Fc-N16,
Fc-N16,N17, and Fc-N132 into HCC2429 downregulated expression of Notch3 ICD. Conditioned media from transfected HEK293T also reduced activated
Notch3 in HCC2429. Similar to the previous transfection experiment, Fc-N16, Fc-N16,N17, and Fc-N132 can reduce Notch3 ICD level but not Fc-N16 or
Fc-N130. B, consistent with the peptide data, the immunoprecipitation experiment shows that Fc fusion proteins bound to Jagged1 but not to Fc control.

Notch3 peptides bind to Jagged1 and inhibit Hey1 transcription. To determine whether the apoptosis induced by
the peptides is Notch dependent, we examined the ability
of the peptides to bind to Jagged1 and to alter transcription
of Notch-dependent genes. Using biotin-labeled Notch3 peptides, we found that the labeled peptides bind to Jagged1expressing HCC2429 but not HEK293T, which does not express endogenous Jagged1 (Fig. 2A). Of the 15 peptides identified, 6 were found to both induce apoptosis and bind to
Jagged1. This interaction was subsequently confirmed with
the in vitro pull-down studies (Fig. 2B). The peptides also inhibited Hey1 transcription with varying potency (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Hes1 transcription was not altered (data not
shown). These findings were consistent with our earlier observation that Notch3 preferentially regulates Hey1 and not
Hes1 in our lung cancer models (4). The ability of the pep-

tides to induce apoptosis confirmed the findings from the
fluorescent screening assay (Fig. 2D). Of the 15 peptides identified by FMAT 8100 HTS screen, six induced apoptosis and
bound to Jagged1.
Notch3 Fc fusion proteins bind to Jagged1 and inhibit
Notch3 activation. A major limitation to using peptides for
in vivo applications is their short biological half-life in the
bloodstream. To overcome this limitation, we used Notch3
Fc fusion proteins, in which recombinant protein is fused
to the Fc domain of human IgG. Fc-N17, Fc-N16,N17, and
Fc-N132 Fc fusion proteins reduced activated Notch3 to differing degrees. Fc-N132 had a greater effect than either FcN16 or Fc-N130, suggesting that the inhibiting activity may
be related to the sequences themselves and not the length.
A similar effect was observed when conditioned media
containing secreted Fc fusion protein were used (Fig. 3A).

Figure 4. Notch3 Fc fusion proteins induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. A, purified Fc fusion proteins Fc-N16,N17 and Fc-N132
inhibited Notch3 activation compared with control. B, when HCC2429 xenografts were treated with Fc fusion proteins Fc-N16,N17 and Fc-N132, tumor
growth was significantly reduced. C, tumors resected from mice treated with Fc-N132, Fc-N16,N17, Fc control, and PBS. The tumors from Fc fusion
protein–treated animals were significantly smaller than those treated with Fc control and PBS. *, P < 0.05.

of EGF-like repeats 7–10, 21–22, or both. B, cotransfection of Jagged1 and full-length Notch3 into HeLa cells resulted in induction of activated Notch3
(ICD). In contrast, activated Notch3 was absent in cells transfected with Jagged1 and mutants N3Δ7-10 and N3Δ21-22. Full-length Notch3 induced
transcription of Hes1 (C) and Hey1 (D) in HeLa cells in the presence of Jagged1. Deletions of EGF-like repeats 7–10, 21–22, or both resulted in decreased
level of Hes1 transcription compared with full-length Notch3. *, P < 0.05.

Interestingly, although not all Fc fusion constructs affected
Notch3 activation, they all retained the ability to bind to
Jagged1 (Fig. 3B).
Notch3 Fc fusion proteins induce apoptosis and inhibit
tumor growth in vivo. Treatment with purified Fc-N16,N17
and Fc-N132 proteins resulted in inhibition of Notch3 activation to levels resemble those obtained with MRK003 (Fig. 4A).
This observation confirmed our early peptide data (Fig. 2D).
To determine the effect of Notch3 Fc fusion proteins in vivo,
we used a HCC2429 human lung cancer xenograft model. We
observed a statistically significant reduction of tumor volume
with Fc-N16,N17 and Fc-N132 treatment compared with Fc
control after 12 days of treatment. After 16 days, the average
tumor volumes with Fc-N16,N17 (0.256 cm3) and Fc-N132
(0.256 cm3) treatment showed a 2-fold reduction compared
with Fc control (0.612 cm3; Fig. 4B and C).
Deletion of putative ligand-binding sites abrogated
Notch3 activation in vitro. To determine whether EGF-like
repeats 7–10 and 21–22 are necessary for signaling, we created constructs N3Δ7-10, N3Δ21-22 and N3Δ7-10, Δ21-22,
similar to the full-length receptor but lacking EGF-like domains 7–10, 21–22, or both (Fig. 5A). Similar strategies were
used in Drosophila to better understand domain functions of
Drosophila Notch (11). Unlike the native full-length receptor,
both N3Δ7-10 and N3Δ21-22 constructs were unable to activate Notch3 cleavage in the presence of Jagged1 (Fig. 5B).
As in many biological systems, modulation of Notch3dependent genes is context dependent. In contrast to early
findings that Notch3 regulates only Hey1 in lung cancer cell
lines, in HeLa cells, transcription of both Hes1 and Hey1
was reduced when Notch3 with deletions of EGF-like domains 7–10, 21–22, or both was used (Fig. 5C and D), supporting the hypothesis that these regions are important for
Notch activation (4).

Discussion
Information about the binding site for Notch receptors
mostly gleaned from studies using Notch deletion mutants
in Drosophila. Of the 36 EGF-like repeats in Drosophila Notch,
repeats 11–12 are sufficient and necessary for interaction
with both Delta and Serrate (12). Similar observations have
been made for mammalian Notch1, in which the loss of calcium binding EGF-like repeats 11, 12, and 13 has been shown
to abrogate receptor function (1).
However, there are differences in structure, tissue distribution, and activation of downstream target genes among the
Notch receptors (13). Unlike Notch1, Notch3 contains 34 instead of 36 EGF-like repeats. Notch3 also differs from Notch1
and Notch2 by its lack of a transactivation domain. Structural and functional differences, therefore, can implicate different ligand recognition sites among the four mammalian
Notch receptors. In this study, using a Notch3 peptide library,
we discovered two regions within the Notch3 ECD important
for ligand binding. Unlike EGF-like repeats 11–13 in Notch1,
our findings suggest that the binding site on Notch3 involves
EGF-like repeats 7–10, with the strongest functional activity
in EGF-like repeats 7–8. This observation differs from that of
Joutel and colleagues (14), in which the mutation C428S located on EGF-like repeat 11 abrogated ligand binding. It is
possible that this mutation results in a conformational
change in the receptor that prevents ligand binding without
being within the ligand-interacting surface of the receptor.
The present data show two potential ligand-binding sites,
EGF-like repeats 7–10 and 21–22, within the ECD of Notch3.
Either site seemed sufficient for receptor activation. Because
similar studies have not been carried out for Notch1, it is not
known whether Notch3 is the only mammalian Notch receptor with two functional domains. In Drosophila, deletion of

Lin et al.

Notch EGF-like repeats 24–26, a part of the genetically defined Abruptex region, results in reduced signaling by the ligand Serrate but not the ligand Delta (15). This observation
suggests that all mammalian Notch receptors may possess
two ligand domains and that the second binding site is important for regulating ligand specificity. Further studies are
needed to test this hypothesis.
The expression of Notch3 in adult mammals is limited to
the vascular system. Embryonic deletion of Notch3 in mice
results in vascular smooth vessel defects, suggesting that targeting this pathway in cancer will result in antiangiogenic
effects (10). Given the role of Notch signaling in maintaining
stem cells, it is possible that inhibiting Notch3 could also
have gut toxicity as observed with γ-secretase inhibitors
(11). Unlike Notch1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
oncogenic mutation has not been associated with Notch3
(16, 17). By contrast, the dysregulation of the Notch3 pathway
in cancer has mostly been associated with overexpression and
gene amplification (3, 18). Thus, interfering with ligandreceptor interaction using peptides and recombinant protein
constitutes promising strategies targeting this pathway.
Although the effects of the peptides and recombinant proteins may not be specific to Notch3, because other Notch receptors use similar ligands, the strategies used in the present
study can potentially be developed for clinical use. Furthermore, the identified functional sites within the receptor
could also serve as targets for therapeutic antibodies or
chemical peptidomimetic screening and production. Our

study, therefore, provides not only insights into the mechanism of Notch3 signaling in lung cancer but also uncovers
specific receptor regions whose targeting results in antitumor activity and may serve as the basis for designing specific
anticancer therapeutics targeting this pathway.
