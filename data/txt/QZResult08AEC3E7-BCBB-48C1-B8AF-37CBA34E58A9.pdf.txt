Abstract
Recently, an efﬁcient liver detoxiﬁcation process dubbed "hepatocyte hopping" was proposed on the basis of ﬁndings with the
endogenous compound, bilirubin glucuronide. According to this
model, hepatocytic bilirubin glucuronide can follow a liver-toblood shuttling loop via Abcc3 transporter-mediated efﬂux and
subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated liver uptake. We hypothesized
that glucuronide conjugates of xenobiotics, such as the anticancer
drug sorafenib, can also undergo hepatocyte hopping. Using
transporter-deﬁcient mouse models, we show here that sorafenib-glucuronide can be extruded from hepatocytes into the bile by

Abcc2 or back into the systemic circulation by Abcc3, and that it
can be taken up efﬁciently again into neighboring hepatocytes by
Oatp1a/1b. We further demonstrate that sorafenib-glucuronide
excreted into the gut lumen can be cleaved by microbial enzymes
to sorafenib, which is then reabsorbed, supporting its persistence
in the systemic circulation. Our results suggest broad relevance of
a hepatocyte shuttling process known as "hepatocyte hopping"—
a novel concept in clinical pharmacology—for detoxiﬁcation of
targeted cancer drugs that undergo hepatic glucuronidation, such
as sorafenib. Cancer Res; 75(13); 2729–36. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

intestinal deconjugation (12). However, the occurrence of enterohepatic recirculation of sorafenib has not been experimentally
demonstrated but was inferred from in vitro biliary clearance
studies in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (13), and provides a means to explain observed time proﬁles of sorafenib levels
in plasma of cancer patients (14).
We recently reported that mice lacking 1A- and 1B-type
organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatp1a/1b), uptake
transporters localized to the sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane of hepatocytes, experience substantially increased plasma
levels of SG after oral sorafenib administration (15). This
phenomenon resembles our earlier ﬁndings with conjugated
bilirubin (16, 17), whereby Oatp1a/1b-deﬁciency leads to
excessive buildup of bilirubin-glucuronide (BG) in the systemic
circulation, which can ultimately result in jaundice. In the case
of bilirubin, Oatp1a/1b transporters work in concert with the
basolaterally located efﬂux transporter Abcc3 (Mrp3) to mediate hepatic efﬂux and subsequent reuptake of BG into hepatocytes, a phenomenon we called "hepatocyte hopping"
(16, 18). This process is operational not only under pathologic,
but also normal physiologic conditions, and results in a substantial amount of hepatocytic BG not being secreted into bile
by Abcc2 (Mrp2), but transported back into the blood by
Abcc3. These molecules are then taken up again in adjacent
downstream hepatocytes by Oatp1a/1b, affording another
chance of being secreted into bile. This liver-to-blood shuttling
loop allows management of situations where biliary secretion
in upstream hepatocytes is saturated, for example due to
substrate overload or incidental inhibition (18). With this
process, BG can be safely eliminated, instead of becoming
trapped inside upstream hepatocytes. Thus, a more evenly
distributed biliary secretion of substrates over the entire liver

Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is approved for treatment of advanced thyroid (1), renal cell (2), and hepatocellular
carcinomas (3), and is being evaluated for treatment of acute
myeloid leukemia (4) and ovarian cancer (5). Like other orally
administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib displays wide
interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, which can signiﬁcantly affect drug-induced toxicity and possibly efﬁcacy (6, 7).
Although the metabolic pathways of sorafenib have been reasonably well established, involving a CYP3A4-mediated route to
form sorafenib-N-oxide (8) and a UGT1A9-mediated route to
form sorafenib-glucuronide (SG; ref. 9), the primary causes of the
pharmacokinetic variability remain unknown (10, 11). It has
been suggested that sorafenib undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, a process that involves removal of solutes from blood by
uptake into hepatocytes, excretion into bile, and intestinal reabsorption, sometimes accompanied by hepatic conjugation and

lobule can be achieved, leading to an efﬁcient hepatic detoxiﬁcation. Although demonstrated so far only for one endogenous solute, based on the broad substrate speciﬁcity of the
transporters involved (19), it is possible that many xenobiotics
and their glucuronide conjugates are subject to the same
hepatocyte hopping process.
In this study, we aimed to understand the processes underlying
sorafenib glucuronide hepatocyte shuttling, biliary excretion, and
intestinal recycling using in vitro and in vivo models, and thus to
elucidate mechanisms contributing to sorafenib interindividual
pharmacokinetic variability.

Materials and Methods
In vitro vesicular transport
Vesicles from Sf9 cells (Life Technologies) expressing mouse
Abcc2 (mAbcc2), rat Abcc2 (rAbcc2), human ABCC2 (ABCC2),
human ABCC3 (ABCC3), or human ABCC4 (ABCC4) were
incubated with sorafenib (10 mmol/L; Chemie Tek) or SG
(10 mmol/L) for 5 minutes in the presence or absence of ATP
(4 mmol/L) or rifampin (100 mmol/L), then lysed with 0.1
mol/L HCl, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS; ref. 20). ATP-dependent transport of sorafenib and SG was determined by subtracting AMPdependent transport from ATP-dependent transport, with both
expressed in pmol/min/mg, after normalization for nonspeciﬁc
transport observed in control vesicles. Uptake experiments were
carried out at a concentration of 10 mmol/L, which is equivalent
to average sorafenib plasma steady-state concentrations achievable in adults and children treated at 400 mg or 200 mg/m2
twice daily (9, 21).
Animals
Abcc4/ mice on a C57BL/6 background were generated and
bred in-house at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis,
TN), and Abcc2/ mice on an FVB background were provided by
Taconic. All other knockout strains on an FVB background were
generated and bred in-house at The Netherlands Cancer Institute
(Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Real-time PCR analyses demonstrated that the expression of relevant drug transporters did not
substantially change in any of these knockout strains (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, the possibility of major compensatory changes in transporter expression affecting the interpretation of results was ruled out. Abcc2/ rats on a Sprague-Dawley
background were obtained from Sage Labs. Mice and rats were
housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-hour
light cycle and given a standard diet and water ad libitum. Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the
Netherlands Cancer Institute.
Plasma pharmacokinetic studies
Murine studies were performed as described previously (15).
Brieﬂy, mice were fasted for 3 hours prior to administration of
sorafenib (10 mg/kg; formulated in 50% Cremophor EL and 50%
ethanol, then diluted 1:4 with deionized water) by oral gavage. A
sorafenib dose of 10 mg/kg in FVB wild-type mice achieves
sorafenib plasma steady-state concentrations ranging from
approximately 6 to 10 mmol/L, similar to that achieved in
humans. Serial blood samples were taken from individual mice
at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 hour from the submandibular vein, at 2 and 4

2730 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

hours from the retro-orbital sinus, and at 7.5 hours by a terminal
cardiac puncture (Abcc2/ and Abcc4/ mice); or by tail vein
sampling at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours and at 8 hours by a
terminal cardiac puncture (all other knockout strains). In Oatp1a/
1b/ mice and all other double- and triple-knockout mice, serial
tail vein blood samples were obtained at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 hours
(peak concentration) after drug administration, and livers were
obtained at the last time point. To evaluate the role of enterohepatic cycling in sorafenib disposition, FVB wild-type mice received
neomycin (200 mg/kg; diluted in saline) by oral gavage, every 12
hours for 5 days. On the last day, mice received SG (10 mg/kg
diluted in water) immediately after the last neomycin dose. In an
initial study, serial blood samples were taken from individual
mice at 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after SG administration, and
sorafenib was not detected in plasma until 8 hours after SG
administration. In a follow-up study, SG was administered and
serial blood samples were obtained at 8 (submandibular vein),
12, and 16 hours (retro-orbital sinus), and at 24 hours (cardiac
puncture). For studies with rats, animals were fasted overnight
before administration of sorafenib (10 mg/kg), and serial
blood samples were taken at 0.5 and 1.5 hours (retro-orbital
plexus), 4 and 8 hours (saphenous vein), 12 hours (tail vein), and
24 hours (cardiac puncture). All blood samples were centrifuged
at 3,000  g for 5 minutes, and tissues were homogenized in
10 volumes (w/v) of water and stored at 80 C until analysis.
Sorafenib and SG pharmacokinetic parameters in all mouse
strains were calculated using noncompartmental techniques via
WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight). In addition, sorafenib plasma concentration–time data from wild-type and Abcc2/ mice were
analyzed simultaneously using population pharmacokinetic
modeling via Monolix version 4.3.3. (22). A one-compartment
model with ﬁrst-order oral absorption was used to model the data.
A covariate (wild-type vs. knockout mouse) on a single parameter
was considered signiﬁcant if the 2 Log-Likelihood was decreased
by at least 3.84 units (P < 0.05).
Urinary excretion studies
Mice were placed into metabolic cages at least 3 days prior to the
start of the study and were kept on reverse 12-hour light cycle, with
free access to a standard diet and water ad libitum. After mice
received a single dose of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage,
serial blood samples were taken at 4.5, 24, 48, and 72 hours and
plasma was isolated by centrifugation. Urine was collected for 72
hours after sorafenib administration. Plasma, urine, and liver
concentrations of sorafenib, sorafenib-N-oxide, and SG were
determined by LC/MS-MS.
Bile collection
Bile duct cannulation/catheterization was done as described
previously (23), except that animals remained under isoﬂurane
anesthesia during the surgery and bile collection. For studies in
mice, bile collection was started 30 minutes after oral sorafenib
administration and continued for 2 hours. In rats, bile collection
was started 2 hours and 25 minutes after oral sorafenib administration and continued for 2 hours, using 15-minute fractions.
Ex vivo microsomal incubations
Mouse liver and intestinal microsomes were prepared as
described previously (24, 25), and rat liver microsomes were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Incubations were performed as
described previously (9).

Results and Discussion
Identiﬁcation of SG as a substrate of ABCC2, ABCC3, and
ABCC4
In order to identify efﬂux proteins involved in the transport of
sorafenib and SG in hepatocytes, experiments were initially
carried out using inside-out vesicles expressing various transporters of the ABCC family. Following a 5-minute incubation period,
sorafenib uptake was moderately increased by human ABCC2,
but not by ABCC3, ABCC4, or mouse Abcc2 (Fig. 1A). Rat Abcc2
may also transport sorafenib, albeit weakly. The modest transport
of sorafenib by human ABCC2 is consistent with an earlier report
demonstrating that overexpression of ABCC2 results in resistance
to sorafenib-induced cell growth inhibition (26).
Unlike for sorafenib, uptake of SG was efﬁciently increased
relative to control vesicles by each transporter tested (Fig. 1B).
ABCC2-, ABCC3-, and ABCC4-mediated uptake was sensitive to

The transport of SG by human ABCC2 was saturable with a
Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of 22  6.6 mmol/L and a
maximal velocity (Vmax) of 155  11 pmol/min/mg, corresponding to a value for transport efﬁciency (Vmax/Km) of 7.0 (Fig. 1C).
The transport of SG by ABCC3 (Km, 186  72 mmol/L; Vmax, 196 
44 pmol/min/mg) and ABCC4 (Km, 146  14 mmol/L; Vmax, 221
 11 pmol/min/mg) was also saturable (Fig. 2D and E), but the
transport efﬁciency was about 7-fold lower than that observed for
ABCC2.
ABCC2 mediates biliary excretion of SG
The in vivo role of ABCC2 in the transport of sorafenib and SG
was next evaluated in Abcc2-deﬁcient (Abcc2/) mice receiving
oral sorafenib (Supplementary Table S2). Compared with wildtype mice, Abcc2-deﬁciency was not associated with altered plasma disposition of sorafenib (Fig. 2A), liver uptake (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1A), or biliary output (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S1C). In contrast, plasma levels of SG after sorafenib
administration were increased by approximately 350-fold in
Abcc2/ mice (Fig. 2D), and accompanied by a decreased liver-to-plasma ratio, and approximately 3-fold increase in liver
concentrations (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S1B). These
changes were not due to increased hepatic or intestinal biotransformation of sorafenib (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B) or
shunted urinary excretion, which was found to be a minor route of
elimination irrespective of Abcc2 status (Supplementary Fig. S2C
and S2D). Consistent with the known localization of Abcc2 on the
bile canalicular membrane (28), we found that the biliary output
of SG was reduced by approximately 12-fold in Abcc2/ mice

(Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S1D), despite an approximately
3-fold higher liver concentration. These ﬁndings suggest that
under Abcc2-proﬁcient conditions, SG is effectively secreted into
bile and its appearance in the systemic circulation represents an
overshoot mechanism that poorly reﬂects the extent of its formation (29).
To determine whether these phenotypes are also observed in
another species, sorafenib pharmacokinetics were assessed in
wild-type and Abcc2/ rats. Abcc2-deﬁciency in rats resulted in
an approximately 2-fold increase in plasma levels of both sorafenib (Fig. 3A) and sorafenib-N-oxide (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly,
however, SG was not detected in plasma or bile of either wild-type
or Abcc2/ rats (Fig. 3C). Ex vivo metabolism studies indicated
that, compared with mice and humans (9), rat liver microsomes
lack a signiﬁcant capacity to form SG (Fig. 3D). These results
indicate that the rat is an inadequate model for the human
pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Moreover, the involvement of
ABCC2 in the transport of unchanged sorafenib may become
increasingly important when glucuronidation is defective, a possibility that is consistent with recent clinical data (10). Collectively, the data indicate that biliary excretion of SG is primarily
mediated by ABCC2 and therefore is an important determinant of
SG pharmacokinetics.
Oatp1a/1b and Abcc3 transporters cooperatively transport SG
in vivo
The disposition of sorafenib was next evaluated in wild-type,
Oatp1a/1b/, Abcc3/, and Oatp1a/1b;Abcc3/ mice. Plasma
levels of sorafenib were not substantially altered in any of the
strains (Supplementary Fig. S3A), and liver levels of sorafenib
were also similar between knockout and wild-type strains (Supplementary Fig. S3B), although plasma sorafenib exposure was
approximately 25% lower in Oatp1a/1b/ mice, similar to our
previous observations (15). These ﬁndings indicate that the

2732 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

differences between the strains were marginal for plasma and
liver levels of sorafenib, and unlikely to directly confound the
interpretation of SG levels.
As shown previously (15), the impact of Oatp1a/1b transporters on the disposition of SG was far higher than that for
sorafenib, and absence of the Oatp1a/1b transporters resulted
in an approximately 60-fold increase in the plasma levels of SG
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S2). Importantly, this
increase was partially reversed (by 2-fold) in Oatp1a/1b;
Abcc3/ mice, suggesting that Abcc3 activity contributes to
the increased plasma levels of SG. In contrast, Abcc3 deﬁciency
alone did not lead to altered plasma SG levels, indicating that
the impact of Abcc3 does not come to the fore in the presence of
Oatp1a/1b transporters (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained
in a separate experiment terminated at 2 hours (i.e., around the
peak plasma levels of SG), showing 125- and 56-fold increased
plasma levels in Oatp1a/1b/ and Oatp1a/1b;Abcc3/ mice
compared with wild-type mice, respectively (Supplementary
Table S3). In liver samples, there was only a slight increase in
SG levels in both Oatp1a/1b/ and Oatp1a/1b;Abcc3/ mice
compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 4B), and an accordingly large decrease in liver-to-plasma ratio (Fig. 4C). As might
be expected, in both Abcc3-deﬁcient strains, liver-to-plasma
ratios of SG were somewhat increased relative to their Abcc3proﬁcient counterparts (Fig. 4C). These data suggest a major
role of Oatp1a/1b transporters in hepatic (re-)uptake of SG and
a clear impact of Abcc3 on sinusoidal extrusion of SG. The role
of Abcc3 as a hepatic basolateral efﬂux transporter of SG is
consistent with the previous observation that SG can be extruded into the medium of sandwich-cultured hepatocytes exposed
to sorafenib (13), and with its partial recovery in urine of
patients treated with sorafenib (29).
Because the present results indicate the presence of another
efﬂux transporter located at the sinusoidal membrane of

hepatocytes that can mostly compensate for the loss of Abcc3, we
next evaluated whether Abcc4 could be this partially redundant
transporter. Using Abcc4/ and Abcc3;Abcc4/ mice, we found
that concentrations of SG in plasma and liver were not substantially affected by Abcc4 deﬁciency, whereas Abcc3/ and Abcc3;
Abcc4/ mice did show increased SG liver-to-plasma concentration ratios compared with both other strains (Supplementary
Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S3). Similar observations were
made for single Abcc4-deﬁciency in another mouse strain, C57BL/
6 (Supplementary Table S2). The data indicate that Abcc4 deﬁciency, unlike Abcc3 deﬁciency, does not have a noticeable impact
on the sinusoidal efﬂux of SG in vivo. The effective expression of
mouse Abcc4 in the sinusoidal membrane may be too low to exert
much effect. Moreover, the modest effect of the Abcc3 deﬁciency
in reducing plasma SG levels in Oatp1a/1b/Abcc3/ and in
Oatp1a/1b/Abcc2/Abcc3/ mice (Fig. 4A and D) suggests that
there are one or more other sinusoidal SG efﬂux mechanisms of
unknown identity, which may provide about similar SG efﬂux
activity as the sinusoidal Abcc3.

The disposition of sorafenib was then evaluated in Oatp1a/1b;
Abcc2/ and Oatp1a/1b;Abcc2;Abcc3/ mice. In line with our
ﬁndings in the single Abcc2/ mice, we found that deletion of
Abcc2 in combination with deletion of Oatp1a/1b led to a very
large increase in plasma exposure of SG compared with wild-type

mice (909-fold), but also compared with Oatp1a/1b/ mice
(12.7-fold; Fig. 4D; Supplementary Table S2). At 2 hours, the liver
levels of SG were 1.8-fold higher in the Oatp1a/1b;Abcc2/ mice
compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4E). As a result of the highly
increased plasma levels of SG, liver-to-plasma ratios decreased in
all transporter knockout mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig.
4F). These ﬁndings support an important role for Abcc2 in the
biliary excretion of SG, and that deletion of Abcc2 in addition to
Oatp1a/1b-deﬁciency leads to a major increase in the sinusoidal
extrusion of this metabolite back into the circulation.
We found that SG plasma exposure was reduced by 30% in
Oatp1a/1b;Abcc2;Abcc3/ mice compared with Oatp1a/1b;
Abcc2/ mice (Fig. 4D). The impact of Abcc3 in liver remained
noticeable with a 1.5-fold increase in absolute levels of SG in liver
(Fig. 4E) and a 1.7-fold increase in the liver-to-plasma ratios (Fig.
4F) at 2 hours in Oatp1a/1b;Abcc2;Abcc3/ mice compared with
Oatp1a/1b;Abcc2/ mice. Plasma and liver levels of sorafenib
were not substantially altered in these strains (Supplementary Fig.
S3C and S3D). Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate that Abcc3 has
a clear impact on sinusoidal secretion of SG, and in combination
with the previously demonstrated ability of Oatp1a/1b to take up
SG across the sinusoidal membrane, can result in "hepatocyte
hopping" of this drug conjugate. However, there are other partially redundant sinusoidal efﬂux transporters for SG that limit the
absolute impact of Abcc3 deﬁciency in mice, perhaps especially at
the high hepatocyte SG levels caused by the impaired biliary
excretion via Abcc2.

b-glucuronidases produced by intestinal microbiota are responsible
for the deconjugation of SG to sorafenib.
To demonstrate that sorafenib can be generated from SG in vivo,
wild-type mice received neomycin or vehicle for 5 days followed
by oral administration of a single dose of SG. In an initial study,
highly variable peak SG concentrations (15.4–3788 ng/mL) were
observed at 15 minutes with rapid elimination within 1 to 2
hours, but sorafenib was not detected in plasma until 8 hours after
SG administration. In a repeat study, blood was collected more
frequently between 8 and 24 hours. Whereas sorafenib levels in
plasma of neomycin-pretreated mice were below the limit of
quantiﬁcation, signiﬁcant levels of sorafenib in plasma were
observed in vehicle-pretreated mice, with a delay in peak levels
(226–897 ng/mL) at 8 hours after SG administration (Fig. 5C).
The substantial delay in availability of sorafenib from SG deconjugated in the small intestine of mice suggests that an 8-hour
sample collection period is too short to observe effects of strongly
altered SG disposition in transporter-deﬁcient mice on parent

SG deconjugation by mouse intestinal b-glucuronidases
In order to assess the fate of SG secreted by Abcc2 into bile, we next
performed ex vivo incubation studies of mouse intestinal (cecal)
content based on the consideration that once in the intestines, SG
may serve as a substrate for bacterial b-glucuronidase enzymes that
are produced by bacteria normally inhabiting the intestines (30).
The removal of the glucuronide group in SG by b-glucuronidase
generates a carbon source for the bacteria and, in the process, SG is
reactivated back to the pharmacologically active sorafenib. Over a 6hour period in a crude suspension of cecal content, we observed a
time-dependent decrease in SG levels and a corresponding increase
in sorafenib (Fig. 5A). Heat-pretreatment of the cecal samples at
65 C resulted in abrogation of sorafenib formation, indicating that
the deconjugation of SG is an enzyme-mediated process. Furthermore, we found that the formation of sorafenib from SG was
reduced by approximately 3-fold in cecal samples from mice that
had been pretreated with neomycin to eliminate the intestinal ﬂora
(Fig. 5B; ref. 31). This ﬁnding is consistent with the conjecture that

Hepatocyte Hopping of Sorafenib-Glucuronide

such as Abcc2 (Fig. 6). Given the broad substrate speciﬁcity of
these transporters, we expect that our ﬁndings will have relevance
for many other xenobiotic glucuronides. These ﬁndings also
suggest that factors that interfere with the hepatocellular shuttling,
biliary excretion, and/or intestinal deconjugation of SG will have
a major impact on sorafenib systemic exposure and likely contribute to the substantial interindividual pharmacokinetic variability observed with sorafenib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors undergoing glucuronidation and enterohepatic recirculation,
such as regorafenib (33).

Figure 6.
Hepatocyte hopping and recirculation of SG. After oral administration,
sorafenib enters the hepatocytes by incompletely deﬁned transporters
mechanisms, including OATP1B-type carriers and OCT1, and undergoes
CYP3A4-mediated metabolism to sorafenib-N-oxide (s-N-oxide) and
conjugation by UGT1A9 to form SG. After conjugation, SG is extensively
secreted into the bile by a process that is mainly mediated by ABCC2. Under
physiologic conditions, a fraction of the intracellular SG is secreted by ABCC3
and at least one other transporter back to the blood, from where it can be
taken up again into downstream hepatocytes via OATP1B1-type carriers
(Oatp1a and Oatp1b in mice). This secretion-and-reuptake loop may prevent
the saturation of ABCC2-mediated biliary excretion in the upstream
hepatocytes, thereby ensuring efﬁcient biliary elimination and hepatocyte
detoxiﬁcation. Once secreted into bile, SG enters the intestinal lumen where it
serves as a substrate for as yet unknown bacterial b-glucuronidases (bGLU)
that produce sorafenib, which subsequently undergoes intestinal absorption
and reenters the systemic circulation.

drug levels in plasma following sorafenib administration (Fig. 2
and Supplementary Figs. S3 and S5). Nonetheless, these results
illustrate the principle that SG biliary excretion followed by
intestinal de-glucuronidation may contribute to extended maintenance of sorafenib plasma exposure in humans, and are consistent with the recent observation that neomycin treatment in
humans decreased systemic exposure to sorafenib by more than
50% (32). In follow-up studies, it will be of interest, based on a
physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for sorafenib, to
conﬁrm this concept in Oatp1a/1b- and Abcc2-deﬁcient mice
using repeat dosing regimens.
In conclusion, this study shows that a sinusoidal liver-to-blood
shuttling loop for SG is formed by Oatp1a/1b, Abcc3, and likely
another sinusoidal efﬂux transporter. Thus, in addition to endobiotic glucuronide metabolites like BG, xenobiotics that undergo
hepatic glucuronidation can also be subject to the same hepatocyte hopping process, depending on the relative afﬁnity of these
compounds for sinusoidal and canalicular efﬂux transporters,
