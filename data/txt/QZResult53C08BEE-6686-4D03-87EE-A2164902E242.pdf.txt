ATR Pathway Inhibition Is Synthetically Lethal in Cancer Cells
with ERCC1 Deﬁciency
Kareem N. Mohni, Gina M. Kavanaugh, and David Cortez

Abstract
The DNA damage response kinase ATR and its effector kinase CHEK1 are required for cancer cells to survive
oncogene-induced replication stress. ATR inhibitors exhibit synthetic lethal interactions, with deﬁciencies in the
DNA damage response enzymes ATM and XRCC1 and with overexpression of the cell cycle kinase cyclin E. Here,
we report a systematic screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with ATR pathway–targeted drugs,
rationalized by their predicted therapeutic utility in the oncology clinic. We found that reduced function in the
ATR pathway itself provided the strongest synthetic lethal interaction. In addition, we found that loss of the
structure-speciﬁc endonuclease ERCC1-XPF (ERCC4) is synthetic lethal with ATR pathway inhibitors. ERCC1deﬁcient cells exhibited elevated levels of DNA damage, which was increased further by ATR inhibition. When
treated with ATR or CHEK1 inhibitors, ERCC1-deﬁcient cells were arrested in S-phase and failed to complete
cell-cycle transit even after drug removal. Notably, triple-negative breast cancer cells and non–small cell lung
cancer cells depleted of ERCC1 exhibited increased sensitivity to ATR pathway–targeted drugs. Overall, we
concluded that ATR pathway–targeted drugs may offer particular utility in cancers with reduced ATR pathway
function or reduced levels of ERCC4 activity. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2835–45. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Replicating DNA is sensitive to a wide array of endogenous
and exogenous damaging agents, which can lead to replication
fork stalling. To accomplish error-free replication, stalled
replication forks need to be stabilized to prevent their collapse
into double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to genomic
rearrangements and/or apoptosis (1, 2). The DNA damage
response kinase ATR coordinates many of the activities at
stalled forks, including fork stabilization and restart (3). ATR
activation also slows the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair
through the phosphorylation of CHK1 (3).
The loss of one or more DNA damage response or repair
pathways drives tumorigenesis but also forces cancer cells to
be more reliant on other pathways, providing an opportunity
for the development of targeted therapeutics (4). For example, cancers with mutations in BRCA1/2 are sensitive to
PARP inhibitors as the replication-associated DSBs caused
by PARP inhibition cannot be repaired when the BRCAdependent homologous recombination system is nonfunctional (5, 6). PARP inhibitors can also trap PARP on DNA
creating a toxic intermediate that requires a second DNA

repair pathway such as homologous recombination or postreplicative repair to remove the PARP–DNA complexes (7).
The synthetic lethality between PARP inhibitors and mutations in BRCA1/2 provides a paradigm for combining DNA
repair inhibitors with speciﬁc mutations or in combination
with chemotherapy agents.
Oncogene activation often initiates an ATR-dependent replication stress response that is needed for continued cell
growth (8–10). Thus, ATR pathway inhibitors are being developed as cancer therapeutics. For example, CHK1 inhibitors
have shown promise in preclinical models, and there are
several ongoing and completed phase I and II clinical trials
(11–13). Recently, speciﬁc ATR inhibitors have been described
by AstraZeneca (14), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (15, 16), and the
Fernandez-Capetillo laboratories (17). These inhibitors function to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines in vitro and
synergize with DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (15).
Furthermore, ATR inhibition demonstrated efﬁcacy in a xenograft mouse model of pancreatic cancer in combination with
gemcitabine (18).
ATR inhibitors also exhibit synthetic lethal interactions with
ATM and XRCC1 deﬁciency as well as with cyclin E overexpression (15, 17, 19). To date, no systematic approach to
identify synthetic lethal interactions with ATR pathway–targeted drugs has been reported. This information could be used
in the clinic to design better clinical trials with ATR pathway–
targeted drugs and improve patient outcomes.
The current study was initiated to identify genes that, when
lost, exhibit synthetic lethal relationships with ATR pathway
inhibitors. We conducted a synthetic lethal screen with DNA
repair proteins and identiﬁed reduced ATR pathway function
and the ERCC1-XPF nuclease as synthetic lethal with ATR or

Synthetic lethal siRNA screen
The custom siRNA library targets 240 known DNA replication and DNA repair genes with 4 unique siRNAs per gene
in individual wells. The siRNA was plated into 96-well plates
in replicates and frozen at —80 C. The plates were thawed
and siRNA was resuspended in OptiMEM with Dharmafect1.
U2OS cells were then added to each plate. The ﬁnal siRNA
concentration was 10 nmol/L. Cells were split into two 96well dishes 72 hours after transfection and incubated in
media with or without ATR inhibitor at a ﬁnal concentration
of 1 mmol/L for an additional 72 hours. Cell viability was
measured with alamar blue (Invitrogen). Nonﬂuorescent
cell-permeable alamar blue dye is reduced to a molecule
that ﬂuoresces red in metabolically active cells, which allows
for a quantitative measure of viability. The percent viability
of ATR inhibitor treated to untreated was determined for
each siRNA to take into account siRNA-speciﬁc effects on
cell growth. The z-scores were calculated using the mean
and SD of the log10(percent viability) values. The values
presented in Fig. 1 are the mean z-scores from three independent transfections.

CHK1 inhibition. ERCC1-XPF functions in the repair of bulky
DNA adducts, double strand breaks, interstrand crosslinks
(ICL), and separation of sister chromatids at fragile sites
(20, 21). Importantly, ERCC1 is being explored as a potential
biomarker in lung and other kinds of cancer (22–25). Low levels
of ERCC1 expression correlate with greater sensitivity to
cisplatin and higher 5-year survival rates. Several phase II
clinical trials are also underway using ERCC1 protein levels
to determine whether to treat patients with platinum-based
chemotherapy (22, 23). Our data demonstrate that both triplenegative breast cancer and non–small cell lung cancer cell lines
depleted of ERCC1 exhibit increased sensitivity to ATR pathway inhibition. Thus, ERCC1 status may be a useful indicator of
sensitivity to ATR pathway–targeted drugs.

ATR Inhibition Is Synthetic Lethal with Loss of ERCC1

RNA interference transfection and sequences
All siRNA transfections were done with 10 nmol/L siRNA
and Dharmafect 1 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with
individual siRNAs 72 hours before the start of an experiment.
The following siRNA sequences were used: siERCC1-1 GAGAAGAUCUGGCCUUAUG, siERCC1-2 CGACGUAAUUCCCGACUAU, siERCC1–4 CAGCGGACCUCCUGAUGGA, siXPF-2
GUAGGAUACUUGUGGUUGA, siXPF-3 ACAAGACAAUCCGCCAUUA, siXPC-2 GGAGGGCGAUGAAACGUUU, siXPC-3 GAGGUGGACUCUCUUCUGA, siXPA-1 GAAAGACUGUGAUUUAGAA, siXPA-2 GCCAUGAACUGACAUAUGA. The nontargeting
siRNA was Qiagen All Star Negative control. Construction
and use of lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) targeting GFP, ATR, and CHK1 has been previously
described (29).
Cell viability assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates 72 hours after siRNA
transfection, the ATR or CHK1 inhibitor was added to the
media for an additional 72 hours and cell viability was measured with alamar blue. Values represent the mean (n ¼ 6) and
error bars represent SD. For statistical analysis, normalized
data were ﬁtted to nonlinear regression curves and used to
determine IC50 values. These IC50 values were compared using
an F test in Prism version 6.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described (30). Primary antibodies ERCC1 (D-10) and PCNA
(FL-261) were purchased from Santa Cruz; H2B (Ab1790) and
Ku70 (Ab3114) were purchased from Abcam; XPF (Bethyl Labs
A301–315); XPC (Novus NB100-477); XPA (NeoMarkers MS650-P0); cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling 9541); and GAPDH
(Millipore MAB374).
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis was performed and quantiﬁed as previously described (30). The gH2AX (JBW301) antibody was purchased from Millipore. Nuclei were stained with
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Cell-cycle analysis and isolation of proteins on nascent
DNA
Propidium iodide (PI) staining and isolation of proteins on
nascent DNA (iPOND) were performed as previously described
(30–32).

Results
Identiﬁcation of synthetic lethal interactions with ATR
inhibition
We performed an siRNA synthetic lethal screen with an
ATR inhibitor (ATRi) to determine cancer contexts that
might provide a therapeutic window for ATR pathway drugs.
As ATR is required for the cellular response to many forms of
DNA damage during S-phase, we reasoned that ATR pathway
inhibition might be most useful in cancer cells lacking other
genome maintenance pathways. Therefore, we generated a
custom library targeting 240 DNA replication and repair

genes with 4 individual siRNAs per gene. The library was
transfected into U2OS cells and then cells were left either
untreated or treated with ATRi for 72 hours, and cell viability
was measured with alamar blue dye (Fig. 1A). Cell viability of
each ATRi-treated sample was scored and compared with
the same untreated siRNA to control for any siRNA-speciﬁc
effects. The dose of ATRi was optimized such that it had only
minimal cell killing on cells expressing a control siRNA and
had maximal killing of cells depleted of ATR (Fig. 1B). Lower
doses of ATRi are sufﬁcient to kill cells depleted of ATR
presumably because less ATRi is needed to completely
inhibit all of the remaining ATR protein. This result also
suggests that the ATR inhibitor does not work by trapping
an inactive protein at the site of damage like PARP inhibitors. The percent viability was calculated for all genes in the
library and converted to a z-score as described in Materials
and Methods. Smaller z-scores indicate more conﬁdent
synthetic lethal relationships to ATRi.
Genes in the ATR pathway were the largest family of DNA
repair proteins to yield strong synthetic lethal relationships
with ATR inhibition (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1).
While not a comprehensive library, every known ATR pathway
gene in the library was synthetic lethal (at least 3 of 4 siRNAs)
with ATRi, including ATR, ATRIP, RPA, CHEK1, CLSPN, HUS1,
RAD1, RAD17, TIMELESS, and TIPIN. ATR pathway genes are
mutated or deleted in up to 25% of some cancer types (33),
suggesting that reduced functionality of the ATR pathway itself
could provide a therapeutic window for ATR-targeted therapies. To conﬁrm that reduced expression of ATR pathway
genes is synthetic lethal with ATRi, we depleted cells of ATR or
CHK1 using shRNA and performed dose–response curves with
ATRi. Silencing of both ATR and CHK1 sensitized cells to ATR
inhibition as compared with a control shRNA (Fig. 1D). Finally,
we conﬁrmed that even heterozygous mutation in ATR is
sufﬁcient to hypersensitize cancer cells to ATR inhibitors using
HCT116 cells lacking one ATR allele (Fig. 1E; ref. 26). The
known synthetic lethal interactions with ATM and XRCC1
were also identiﬁed in the screen further validating the screening procedure.
ERCC1-XPF–deﬁcient cells are sensitive to ATR pathway
inhibition
One of the high scoring genes identiﬁed in the synthetic
lethal screen was ERCC1. As described in the Introduction,
ERCC1 has recently been suggested as an important biomarker in lung and other kinds of cancer (22). To validate
ERCC1, and its binding partner XPF, deﬁciencies as synthetic lethal with ATR inhibition, we knocked down ERCC1 and
XPF with 2 individual siRNAs and performed dose–response
curves with ATRi. Both siRNAs for each gene sensitized cells
to ATRi by as much as one order of magnitude (Fig. 2A and
B). To test whether the synthetic lethality was speciﬁc to
ATR or more generalizable to the ATR pathway, we also
treated knockdown cells with a CHK1 inhibitor (CHK1i).
Both ERCC1 and XPF knockdown also sensitized cells to
CHK1i, suggesting that inhibition of the ATR pathway and
not only ATR is synthetic lethal in ERCC1-XPF–deﬁcient
cells. ERCC1 knockdown always yielded greater synthetic

Figure 2. ATR pathway inhibition is synthetic lethal with ERCC1/XPF deﬁciency. A–F, U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and then treated
with the ATR or CHK1 inhibitor. NT represents the nontargeting siRNA and the numbers after speciﬁc siRNAs refer to the sequences described in Materials
and Methods. Cell viability was determined with alamar blue and reported as a percent of the untreated control cells for ERCC1 (A), XPF (B), XPC (D),
and XPA (E). All knockdowns were done simultaneously and separated into individual graphs for ease in comparison, and the control siRNA values are
identical in each graph. Knockdown of ERCC1 or XPF yielded signiﬁcant reductions in IC50 values as compared with control cells (P < 0.001) whereas
knockdown of XPC or XPA did not. Statistics are described in Materials and Methods. C, U2OS cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were treated

signiﬁcantly reduced the IC50 values of ATRi and CHK1i as
compared with control cells. This difference may derive from
the differences in viability caused by the ERCC1 or XPF
knockdown on their own. In all siRNA experiments pre-

sented, knockdown of XPF by itself reduces the viability of
cells more than knockdown of ERCC1. For example, in U2OS
cells, knockdown of ERCC1 or XPF results in 80% and 60%
viability, respectively. Thus, it is harder to observe large
losses in viability with the addition of ATR pathway

alone. To control for this, we tested synthetic lethality by
colony-forming assays, which are not inﬂuenced by different
rates of cell growth. We observe that both ERCC1 and XPF
knockdown signiﬁcantly sensitize cells to ATRi and CHK1i
treatment (Fig. 2C). As expected, knockdown of ERCC1 and
XPF also sensitized cells to cisplatin.
As ERCC1-XPF regulates sensitivity to cisplatin via the
nucleotide excision repair (NER) and ICL repair pathways,
we wished to determine whether loss of NER sensitized cells
to ATR pathway inhibition. Neither the core NER genes XPC
and XPA nor the TFIIH components XPB and XPD were
synthetic lethal with ATRi in our screen (Fig. 1C). When
tested individually, XPC and XPA depletion sensitized cells
to cisplatin but did not sensitize cells to ATRi or CHK1i in
either short-term growth/viability or colony-forming assays

NER deﬁciency does not sensitize cells to ATR pathway
inhibition. Protein knockdown for all siRNAs was conﬁrmed
by Western blotting (Fig. 2E and F). As expected, knockdown
of ERCC1 also knocked down XPF and vice versa with siRNA
targeting ERCC1, more efﬁciently reducing the levels of both
proteins as compared with siRNA targeting XPF (34, 35). One
of the siRNAs targeting ERCC1 also mildly reduced the level
of XPC, but as the other siRNA did not knockdown XPC and
as XPC knockdown had no effect on synthetic lethality, this
potential off-target effect cannot explain the observed synthetic lethality. The dose–response curves are presented as
percent of untreated controls and values above 100% for low
doses of ATRi and CHK1i are likely due to increased rates of
cell growth associated with partial ATR pathway inhibition.
To further conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the synthetic lethality
with ERCC1/XPF, we tested it in more well-deﬁned genetic
systems to eliminate the possibility of any off-target effects

of siRNA knockdowns. XPF-mutant patient cells were more
sensitive to ATRi, CHK1i, and cisplatin as compared with the
complemented cells (Fig. 2G). In addition, A549 lung cancer
cells in which ERCC1 was speciﬁcally disrupted were more
sensitive to ATRi, CHK1i, and cisplatin as compared with the
complemented cells (Fig. 2H). These 2 isogenic cell lines with
deﬁciencies in XPF or ERCC1 further validate the speciﬁcity
of this genetic interaction and demonstrate that loss of
ERCC1 and XPF are required for the observed synthetic
lethality.
ERCC1 deﬁciency causes elevated DNA damage that is
further increased when the ATR pathway is inhibited
In a previous screen, knockdown of ERCC1 and XPF both
caused signiﬁcant increases in the amount of gH2AX suggesting the induction of DNA damage in their absence (36).
We conﬁrmed this observation by immunoﬂuorescence of
control and ERCC1-depleted cells either untreated or treated
with ATRi. The dose of ATRi used does not cause a noticeable increase in the amount of gH2AX in control cells;
however, ERCC1 knockdown causes a signiﬁcant increase
in the amount of gH2AX in untreated cells, which is further
increased in ATRi-treated cells (Fig. 3A and B). Of note, in

2840

untreated cells, ERCC1 knockdown results in gH2AX foci,
but when ATRi is added, the staining changes to a combination of foci and pan-nuclear gH2AX, with the pan-nuclear
staining being much brighter than the staining of gH2AX in
foci (Fig. 3A). Pan-nuclear gH2AX is often associated with
high levels of replication stress (30, 37).
To further quantify this data, we scored the percentages of
cells with no gH2AX, gH2AX in foci, and gH2AX in a pannuclear staining pattern in untreated, ATRi, and CHK1itreated cells. ERCC1 and XPF knockdown both caused a
statistically signiﬁcant increase in the amount of gH2AX foci
in untreated cells (Fig. 3C). The amount of these foci was
increased, as where the percentage of cells exhibiting pannuclear gH2AX with the addition of ATRi (Fig. 3D). As
expected, CHK1i treatment of control cells caused a large
increase in the amount of gH2AX foci and a small percent of
cells with pan-nuclear gH2AX (Fig. 3E) (38). ERCC1 knockdown further increased these phenotypes with as many as
50% to 70% of cells exhibiting pan-nuclear gH2AX (Fig. 3E).
As observed previously, the increases in gH2AX were larger
in ERCC1-depleted cells than in XPF-depleted cells, likely
due to the slower growth rate of XPF-depleted cells. XPC
knockdown exhibited the same phenotypes as control

As ERCC1-deﬁcient cells accumulate in S-phase, we reasoned that ERCC1 may be necessary for DNA replication in
cancer cells. To test this, we puriﬁed replication forks using
iPOND (31, 32) and identiﬁed ERCC1 at replication forks (lane
7, Fig. 4E). Brieﬂy, cells were labeled with the thymidine analog
EdU for a short amount of time to label active replication forks.
The EdU was then puriﬁed and proteins co-purifying with it
were analyzed by Western blot analysis. ERCC1 was also
present at stalled [hydroxyurea (HU)-treated] and collapsed
forks (HU- and ATRi-treated; lanes 9 and 10, Fig. 4E). Its
association with replication forks is not due to a general
interaction with chromatin, as ERCC1 is not associated with
bulk chromatin that is not adjacent to a replication fork, as it
can be chased away with thymidine (lane 8, Fig. 4E). These
results are also consistent with the prior identiﬁcation of XPF
at replication forks using iPOND (39).

knockdown cells, further conﬁrming our observation that
the synthetic lethality is independent of NER. Together,
these experiments suggest that the ATR pathway is needed
to repair DNA damage caused by loss of ERCC1-XPF.
The ATR pathway is required for S-phase progression in
ERCC1-deﬁcient cells
To determine the mechanism for synthetic lethality with
ATRi in ERCC1-deﬁcient cells, we knocked down ERCC1,
treated cells with either ATRi or CHK1i, and analyzed their
progression through the cell cycle. Control cells left untreated or treated with either inhibitor completed DNA replication and proceeded to M phase of the cell cycle where they
arrested at the mitotic checkpoint in the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 4A and B). Conversely, ERCC1-deﬁcient cells
treated with ATRi accumulated in S-phase and did not
complete DNA synthesis (Fig. 4B). The ERCC1-deﬁcient cell
population exhibits a large enrichment in S-phase and a
reduction in cells with 4N DNA content (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, ATRi-treated, ERCC1-deﬁcient cells exhibit higher
levels of cleaved PARP at both 24 and 48 hours after addition
of ATRi as compared with control ATRi-treated control cells
(Fig. 4D). This is also consistent with the increase in cells
with less than 2N DNA content in ERCC1-deﬁcient cells
observed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 4B and C). Thus, ERCC1deﬁcient cells undergo apoptosis after addition of ATR
pathway–targeted drugs.

ATR pathway inhibition does not increase micronuclei
formation in ERCC1-deﬁcient cells
After DNA replication, ERCC1 plays a role in proper segregation of chromosomes, and knockdown of ERCC1 causes an
increase in micronuclei formation as chromosomes fail to
segregate properly (40, 41). As expected, we observed a significant increase in the amount of micronuclei formation when
we knocked down ERCC1 (Fig. 5A and B). This induction was
not increased further with the addition of ATRi or CHK1i.
These data suggest that ATR pathway inhibition does not affect
the postreplicative functions of ERCC1 such as chromosome
segregation.
ERCC1 deﬁciency sensitizes cancer cell lines to ATR
pathway–targeted drugs
To test how generalizable our observations were, we
extended our study to include 2 triple-negative breast cancer
cell lines and 2 non–small cell lung cancer cell lines. Dose–
response curves of ATRi and CHK1i were completed on
cancer cell lines depleted of ERCC1 with two speciﬁc siRNAs
(Fig. 6). In all cases, cells depleted of ERCC1 were more
sensitive to ATRi and CHK1i treatment than control cells.
We did not observe a strict correlation between the degree of
ERCC1 knockdown and the observed synthetic lethality
perhaps due to changes in cell growth rates or unknown
off-target effects. Nonetheless, these data indicate that
ERCC1 protects cancer cells from ATR pathway–targeted
drugs in multiple cancer types.

Discussion
ATR pathway inhibitors are currently in clinical trials and
have shown promise in combination with platinum drugs and
gemcitabine (11, 15, 18). The current study was initiated to
determine whether any synthetic lethal interactions exist
between DNA repair proteins and ATR pathway–targeted
drugs. Our siRNA screen identiﬁed ERCC1-XPF deﬁciency as
a potent sensitizer to ATR pathway inhibition in cancer cells.
Loss of ERCC1 or XPF causes an increase in the number of
gH2AX foci in untreated cells, and addition of the ATR or CHK1
inhibitors results in pan-nuclear gH2AX, suggestive of large

amounts of replication stress. ATR and CHK1 inhibitors cause
an S-phase arrest in ERCC1-deﬁcient cells and these cells fail to
enter mitosis even when the inhibitors are removed. ERCC1XPF are often lost in many types of cancers (22, 23, 42), and we
report that depletion of ERCC1-XPF in both triple-negative
breast cancer and non–small cell lung cancer sensitize these
cancer cells to killing with ATR pathway–targeted drugs.
Together, our data indicated that ERCC1 status in cancer may
help guide the choice of an ATR pathway–targeted drug for
treatment.

XRCC1 (19), suggesting the validity of our approach and screen
design. In addition, we also observed strong synthetic lethality
with all of the known ATR pathway genes that were present in
the siRNA library. ATR pathway genes are mutated or deleted
in up to 15% to 25% of samples from some cancer types,
suggesting that reduced ATR pathway functionality may be a
useful criteria for selecting patients for ATR-targeted drugs
(33). Furthermore, the screening strategy is also a useful
approach to identify novel ATR pathway proteins, some of
which may prove to be druggable targets, such as the recently
reported replication protein A inhibitors (43, 44).
Notably, not all DNA repair pathways are synthetic lethal
with ATR inhibition. For example, neither nucleotide excision
repair nor mismatch repair deﬁciencies cause hypersensitization to ATR inhibitors. This study represents the ﬁrst

ATR Inhibition Is Synthetic Lethal with Loss of ERCC1

systematic search for synthetic lethal interactions with ATR
pathway–targeted drugs. Performing this screen with the
CHK1 inhibitor or in a whole-genome siRNA library may reveal
additional genetic relationships that can be exploited for
cancer therapy.
ERCC1-XPF synthetic lethality with ATR inhibition
We present 2 possible explanations for the observed synthetic lethality between ERCC1-XPF deﬁciency and ATR inhibition. First, we and others have observed ERCC1-XPF at
replication forks and it is possible that in their absence,
replication forks become unstable and require ATR to maintain them. Second, defects in the repair of ICLs and replication
of genomic fragile sites when ERCC1-XPF are inactivated (20,
21) may create an increased need for ATR signaling. The ﬁrst
possible explanation is unlikely, as it does not appear that
ERCC1 loss affects the inherent stability of stalled replication
forks. ERCC1-depleted cells are not sensitive to HU, a fork
stalling agent, and are able to resume DNA synthesis quickly
after HU removal (ref. 45 and data not shown).
We favor the second explanation that incomplete repair and
replication processes induced by loss of ERCC1-XPF are the
source of ATR dependency. The amount of endogenous DNA
damage is increased in the absence of ERCC1-XPF as indicated
by the increase in gH2AX. This gH2AX is likely caused as
incomplete repair intermediates collapse into DSBs. Repair of
these breaks and completion of DNA replication require ATR,
explaining the observed synthetic lethality. This explanation is
also consistent with our observation that ERCC1-XPF–deﬁcient cells do not complete S-phase when ATR is inhibited.
Importantly, the repair requirement for ERCC1-XPF that is
synthetic lethal with ATR inhibition is not standard nucleotide
excision repair as other NER genes are not synthetic lethal with
ATRi.
We did observe some differences between knockdown of
ERCC1 and XPF in some assays. We suspect this difference is
largely due to differences in knockdown efﬁciencies and resulting cell growth rates. The similar results seen in the colonyforming assays, which are less inﬂuenced by cell growth rates
than the alamar blue assay, are consistent with this explanation. However, it is also possible that some differences are due
to XPF-independent functions of ERCC1 (46).
Loss of ERCC1-XPF is also synthetic lethal with PARP
inhibition although the mechanism is likely to be different
than the synthetic lethality observed with ATR. ERCC1-deﬁcient cells treated with PARP inhibitors undergo a prolonged
G2–M arrest accompanied by activated checkpoint signaling
(45, 47). The authors of these studies suggest that in the context
of PARP inhibition, the essential role of ERCC1 is in homologous recombination, as ERCC1 loss yields the same phenotype as BRCA2 loss. This contrasts with the strong S-phase
arrest seen in ERCC1-deﬁcient cells treated with ATRi. Our

data suggest that ERCC1 is also functioning during DNA
replication, presumably to repair endogenous sources of DNA
damage that stall the replication fork and in the resolution of
replication intermediates at fragile sites.
ERCC1 as a predictive biomarker for ATR pathway–
targeted therapies
ERCC1 is a recognized modulator of the response to
platinum-based chemotherapies (22, 25). As such, much
effort has been devoted to evaluating ERCC1 levels in tumor
samples to guide treatment. While there has been controversy in the best methods to detect ERCC1 in tumors due to
the inability of PCR and antibody-based detection methods
to discriminate between the functional and nonfunctional
ERCC1 isoforms (22, 25), several laboratories are working to
develop appropriate tumor screening methods. Thus, clinical evaluation of ERCC1 levels in tumors is a viable diagnostic option before the initiation of chemotherapy. Depletion of ERCC1 in every cancer cell line we have tested
sensitizes the cells to ATR pathway inhibition. Therefore,
tumors with low levels of ERCC1 may prove more sensitive
to ATR pathway inhibitors and provide a patient selection
strategy. We are also excited about the recent disclosure of
ERCC1-XPF small-molecule inhibitors (48). These inhibitors,
combined with ATR pathway–targeted drugs, could be used
in combination therapies to treat cancer cells and improve
outcomes.
