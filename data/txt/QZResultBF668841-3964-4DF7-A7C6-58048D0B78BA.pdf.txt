Abstract
Various epidemiologic studies have shown that obesity is
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Leptin, the key
player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight
control, also acts as a growth factor on certain organs in both
normal and disease states. It is plausible that leptin acts to
promote hepatocellular carcinogenesis directly affecting
malignant properties of liver cancer cells. However, a direct
role for leptin in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been
shown. In this study, we analyzed the role of leptin and the
mechanism(s) underlying its action in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which express both short and long isoforms of
leptin receptors. Treatment with leptin resulted in increased
proliferation of both HepG2 and Huh7 cells and involves
activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription
3 (STAT3), AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) signaling pathways. Leptin-induced phosphorylation
of ERK and AKT was dependent on Janus-activated kinase
(JAK)/STAT activation. Intriguingly, we also found that leptin
potently induces invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells
in Matrigel invasion and electric cell-substrate impedancesensing assays. Leptin-stimulated invasion was effectively
blocked by pharmacologic inhibitors of JAK/STAT and, to a
lesser extent, by ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibition. Importantly, leptin also induced the migration of
both HepG2 and Huh7 cells on fibronectin matrix. Inhibition of
JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K activation using pharmacologic
inhibitors effectively blocked leptin-induced migration of
HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Taken together, these data indicate
that leptin promotes hepatocellular carcinoma growth, invasiveness, and migration and implicate the JAK/STAT pathway
as a critical mediator of leptin action. Our findings have
potential clinical implications for hepatocellular carcinoma
progression in obese patients. [Cancer Res 2007;67(6):2497–507]

preventive interventions capable of making a significant effect on
cancer (1, 2). The management of normal body weight is regulated
by adipocytokines that act on the brain to regulate food intake (3).
The adipocytokines are biologically active polypeptides that are
produced exclusively or substantially by white adipose tissue,
preadipocytes, and mature adipocytes and act by endocrine,
paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms (3, 4). Leptin, a product of
the obese (ob) gene is a neuroendocrine hormone that has
attracted attention since its identification in 1995 (5, 6). It is a
multifunctional peptide hormone with wide ranging biological
activities including appetite regulation, bone formation, reproductive function, and angiogenesis (7–9). These biological activities
suggest an important role in cancer proliferation, invasion, and
metastasis (10). Leptin circulates as a 16-kDa protein partially
bound to plasma proteins (11, 12) and exerts its actions through
its specific receptors present in a variety of tissues localized to the
cell membrane (13).
Leptin receptor belongs to a family of class I cytokine receptors,
which typically contain a cytokine receptor homologous domain in
the extracellular region (14). All six isoforms have a similar
extracellular ligand-binding domain at the NH2 terminus but differ
at the intracellular COOH-terminal domain. Although all five short
isoforms have transmembrane domains, only the long form has the
intracellular motifs necessary for activation of signaling pathways
(14). As with other class I cytokine receptors, the leptin signaling is
thought to be transmitted mainly by the Janus-activated kinase/
signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT)
pathway (15, 16). JAKs associate constitutively with conserved box 1
and 2 motifs in the intracellular domain of Ob-Rb (long isoform of
leptin receptor). Binding of leptin to Ob-Rb results in autophosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 as well as phosphorylation of the
cytoplasmic domain of Ob-Rb and the downstream transcription
factors STATs (15). The leptin signal is terminated by induction of
suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-3), a member of a family
of proteins that inhibits the JAK-STAT signaling cascade (17, 18).
SOCS proteins have a variable NH2-terminal domain, a central
SH2 domain, and a COOH-terminal domain, termed SOCS-box
motif. They are induced by cytokines and act in a negative feedback
loop to inhibit the receptor. Thus, overexpression of SOCS-3
inhibits leptin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 (17–19).
Whether activation of the above pathways by leptin occurs in
hepatocellular carcinoma cells remains unknown.
Large population prevalence studies have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma is clearly associated with obesity (20–24).
A research group from Denmark assessed the relative risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma in a study cohort of 43,965 obese patients

and concluded that the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma for obese
patients was increased to 1.9 compared with the general
population (25). A more recent U.S. study reported a similar effect
of obesity on hepatocellular carcinoma even after multivariate
analysis. This study included 404,576 men and 495,477 women with
body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 kg/m2 at enrollment who were
observed for 16 years. Stratification of overall and site-specific
cancer-related deaths according to BMI showed that hepatocellular
carcinoma was 1.68 times higher among women with a baseline
BMI of 35 kg/ m2 and was 4.52 times higher for men with a
similarly increased BMI compared. Most notably, among the male
group, hepatocellular carcinoma had the highest relative-risk
increase as a consequence of obesity compared with all the
cancers studied, including prostate, kidney, gallbladder, colon,
rectum, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas (26). Another clinical
study recently examined obesity as an independent risk factor for
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis who underwent
transplantation, concluding that obesity is indeed a statistically
significant independent risk factor after multivariate analysis
(2, 26, 27). At present, a biological explanation for risk associated
between obesity and hepatocellular carcinoma is not known.
Therefore, the effects of obesity on human hepatocellular
carcinoma represent a critical intersection between these two
important health problems. However, whether there is a direct
relationship between leptin and hepatocellular carcinoma cannot
be conclusively stated as increased leptin and hepatocellular
carcinoma may both be secondary consequences of obesity.
Considering the fundamental role of adipocytokines in cancer
progression, the growth regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma
cells by leptin might affect their malignant progression. Therefore,
in the present study, we examined the expression of leptin
receptors using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. We further
investigated the effects of leptin on the malignant properties of
hepatocellular carcinoma, including proliferation, invasion, and
migration. We also elucidated the signal transduction pathways
regulating leptin-induced changes in the cancerous properties of
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies. Antibodies for phosphorylated AKT (pAKT-Ser473), antiAKT, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK-Thr202/
Tyr204), anti-ERK, phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT-Tyr705), and anti-STAT
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Antibodies for short
and long forms of leptin receptors Ob-R (C-20), Ob-R (B-3), and Ob-R
(H-300) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa
Cruz, CA).
Cell culture, reagents, and treatments. The following hepatocellular
carcinoma cell lines were used: (a) HepG2 cells derived from a human
hepatoblastoma (28) and (b) Huh7 cells derived from a hepatocellular
carcinoma (29). HepG2 and Huh7 were grown in MEM and DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bioproducts, West
Sacramento, CA) and 2 Amol/L L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA),
respectively. For treatment, cells were seeded at a density of 1  106 per
100-mm tissue culture dish. After 16 h of serum starvation, the culture
media were changed to serum-free media containing leptin treatments as
indicated. In other sets of experiments, cells were treated with the JAK/
STAT inhibitor AG490 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) at 100 Amol/L, the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling)
at 10 Amol/L, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor
PD098059 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 10 Amol/L for indicated durations. For
electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing (ECIS) invasion assay, human
umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVEC; American Type Culture Collection

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

(ATCC), Manassas, VA] were maintained in HAM’s F-12 medium (ATCC)
containing 10% FBS, 0.1 mg/mL heparin (Sigma), and 0.05 mg/mL
endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Total cellular RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantified
by UV absorption. RNA integrity was confirmed by using formaldehyde
agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Complementary
DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 2.5 Ag total RNA by reverse transcription
at 42jC for 1 h using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The
synthesized cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification. A
semiquantitative PCR amplification was carried out using specific primers
designed to amplify leptin receptors Ob-Rb (long isoform) and Ob-Rt (short
isoform). The primers were as follows: Ob-Rb sense, 5¶-TCACCCAGTGATTACAAGCT-3¶; Ob-Rb antisense, 5¶-CTGGAGAACTCTGATGTCCG-3¶; Ob-Rt
sense, 5¶-CATTTTATCCCCATTGAGAAGTA-3¶; Ob-Rt antisense, 5¶-CTGAAAATTAAGTCCTTGTGCCCAG-3¶. PCR generated 1,071- and 273-bp fragments of the Ob-Rb and Ob-Rt genes, respectively. To ensure that
amplification of these genes was within the exponential range, different
numbers of cycles (25–40) were run. Finally, 30 cycles of PCR amplification
were chosen. PCR conditions were 95jC for 5 min (denaturation) and
30 cycles of 95jC for 1 min, 55jC for 1 min, 72jC for 1 min followed by 72jC
for 5 min. In addition, specific primers for the 18S RNA were used as
control. The primers were sense, 5¶-GAGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGG-3¶ and
antisense, 5¶-GTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTTGC-3¶. PCR products were resolved
by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining.
Immunoprecipitation of Ob-Rb and Ob-Rt. For immunoprecipitation
of the long and short forms of leptin receptor (30), COLO 320DM cell
lysate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and whole-cell lysates from HepG2 and
Huh7 cells were incubated with either Ob-R (C-20; specific for the long
form of leptin receptor) or Ob-R (H-300; for both long and short forms of
leptin receptor), and the mixture was rotated slowly at 4jC for 16 h. IgG
served as a negative control. A total of 20 AL packed protein A/G agarose
beads was added, and mixture was incubated at 4jC for 1 h with rotation.
The beads were collected by gentle centrifugation and washed twice with
1.5 mL ice-cold buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L NaF]. After the final wash, the
precipitated protein-beads complexes were resuspended in SDS-sample
loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. Immunodetection was done by blocking the membranes for
1 h in TBS buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20] containing 5% powdered nonfat milk followed by addition of
the mouse monoclonal Ob-R (B-3) antibody (specific for both long and
short forms of leptin receptor) in TBS for 2 h at room temperature.
Specifically bound primary antibodies were detected with peroxidasecoupled secondary antibodies and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of ObRb expression in human liver tissue. Normal liver
tissue (two samples) was obtained during surgical liver resection for
secondary liver cancer. The tissue was obtained at a minimum of 5-cm
distance from the tumor, and normal histology was assessed by routine
examination. Pathologic tissue was obtained from thre patients undergoing
surgical resection for trabecular hepatocellular carcinoma. Specimens
from the tumor and from peritumoral noninvolved tissue were obtained
immediately after resection and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Liver
cirrhosis was present in the peritumoral tissue of all three patients (two
HCV related and one HBV related). All procedures were in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Regional Committee on Human Experimentation (Florence, Italy). Tissue was homogenized with 20 strokes in a glassTeflon homogenizer with a buffer of the following composition: 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L
Na3VO4, 2 mmol/L PMSF, 1 Ag/mL trypsin inhibitor, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and
1 Ag/mL pepstatin A. Insoluble proteins were discarded by high-speed
centrifugation at 4jC. Protein concentration was measured in triplicate

with a commercially available assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of
proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as indicated below. Autoluminograms were scanned, and signals were quantified with Image J software.
Background signal was subtracted in each sample. Ob-Rb levels are
expressed as the ratio between specific signal and signal of a housekeeping
gene (b-actin) analyzed on the same membranes.
Western blot. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells in 250
AL of ice cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.25% Nadeoxycholate, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L NaF; ref. 30]. The lysate was rotated
360 degrees for 1 h at 4jC followed by centrifugation at 12,000  g for
10 min at 4jC to clear the cellular debris. Proteins were quantified using
the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of
proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blot analyses were done using
the previously described antibodies. Immunodetection was done using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of DNA/cell proliferation assay by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation analysis
was done using an ELISA (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Approximately 5  103 HepG2 or Huh7 cells were cultured in the presence of leptin
at 25 to 200 ng/mL for 12, 24, and 48 h in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells
grown in serum-free media served as a negative control, whereas cells
grown in the presence of serum (10% FBS) served as positive control for
proliferation. BrdUrd incorporation assays were done as described
previously (31). Subsequently, BrdUrd was added to the cultures for 4 h.
Cells were fixed and DNA denatured. The anti–BrdUrd-POD monoclonal
antibody from mouse-mouse hybrid cells conjugated with peroxidase was
used at 1:100 and binds to the BrdUrd incorporated in newly synthesized
cellular DNA. Resultant immunocomplexes were quantified by emitted light
measurements using a microplate luminometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) with photomultiplier technology. Relative light units per seconds
directly correlate to the amount of DNA synthesis and the number of
proliferating cells.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis/cellular DNA flow
cytometry using propidium iodide (S-phase analysis). Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of HepG2 and Huh7 cells was carried
out using Cellular DNA Flow Cytometry analysis (Roche, Indianapolis, IN),
as per manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown and synchronized in
serum-free for 16 h followed by treatment with leptin (100 ng/mL) for
various time intervals (8, 12, and 24 h). Cells grown in serum-free media
served as a negative control, whereas cells grown in the presence of serum
(10% FBS) and platelet-derived growth factor served as positive control.
Cells were harvested, adjusted to equal cell numbers, fixed in 70% ethanol
for 30 min at 20jC, and suspended in 500 AL PBS containing RNase A
(5 Prime 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO; 250 mg/L) for 30 min at 4jC. Fixed cells
were stained with propidium iodide (100 mg/L) before FACS analysis as
described elsewhere (31). Briefly, after excitation of propidium iodide at
485 nm, red fluorescence from propidium iodide was collected through a
580-nm long-pass filter and recorded to measure cellular DNA content.
After counting 3.5  104 cells, the number of cells in each phase of cell
cycles (G0-G1, S, and G2-M) was analyzed to assess the respective DNA
content. The HepG2 and Huh7 cell cycle profile was determined using a
Becton Dickinson FACScan, and data were analyzed using ModFit LT 3.1.
Tumor cell invasion assay. For an in vitro model system for metastasis,
we did a Matrigel invasion assay by using a Matrigel invasion chamber from
BD Biocoat Cellware (San Jose, CA; ref. 30). Cells were seeded at a density of
1  105 per insert and cultured overnight. After 16 h of serum starvation,
the culture media were changed to serum-free media containing treatments
as indicated. Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. Cells were
treated with human recombinant leptin (Sigma) at 100 ng/mL. In other sets
of experiments, cells were treated with the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490
(Calbiochem) at 100 Amol/L, the MAPK inhibitor PD098059 (Sigma) at
10 Amol/L, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling) at 10 Amol/L
along with leptin. After 24 h of incubation, cells remaining above the insert

membrane were removed by gentle scraping with a sterile cotton swab.
Cells that had invaded through the Matrigel to the bottom of the insert were
fixed in methanol for 10 min. After being washed in PBS, the cells were
stained with H&E. The insert was subsequently washed in PBS and briefly
air-dried and mounted. The slides were coded to prevent counting bias, and
the number of invaded cells on a representative section of each membrane
was counted with light microscope. The number of invaded cells for each
experimental sample represents the average of triplicate wells.
ECIS invasion assay. Electrode arrays were obtained from Applied
BioPhysics (Troy, NY), and ECIS invasion assays were done (32). ECIS array
wells were precoated with a solution of 200 Ag/mL gelatin in 0.15 mol/L
NaCl. After 15 min of incubation to allow the gelatin to adsorb, the gelatin
solution was aspirated, and the electrode containing wells were rinsed twice
with PBS. They were partially filled with 200 AL HUVEC medium and
allowed to equilibrate for 15 to 60 min in humidified CO2 incubator.
Approximately 1  105 HUVECs were added in 200 AL HUVEC medium in
each well. The attachment and spreading of cells into the ECIS wells was
followed by impedance measurements using ECIS (model 1600R, Applied
BioPhysics). The HUVECs were challenged with monodisperse cell
suspensions of HepG2 and Huh7 cells (20  105/mL) in fresh HUVEC
medium, and 50 AL was added to wells (one hepatocellular carcinoma cell
for each endothelial cell). Triplicate wells were used for each treatment.
Cells were treated with human recombinant leptin (Sigma) at 100 ng/mL. In
other sets of experiments, cells were treated with the JAK/STAT inhibitor
AG490 (Calbiochem) at 100 Amol/L, the MAPK inhibitor PD098059 (Sigma)
at 10 Amol/L, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling) at 10 Amol/L
along with leptin. The impedance of the challenged endothelial cell layer
was monitored via ECIS for the next 12 to 20 h (32).
Migration assay. To perform migration assays (33), cells were plated
into 24-well cell culture plate and precoated with human fibronectin
(5 Ag/cm2; Sigma). Cells were allowed to grow in 10% FBS containing
DMEM to confluence, washed with serum-free medium, and serum starved
for 16 h. A 1-mm wide scratch was made across the cell layer using a sterile
pipette tip. After washing with serum-free medium twice, DMEM containing
10 Ag/mL human fibronectin was added to replace matrix depleted with
the cells. Cells were treated with human recombinant leptin (Sigma) at
100 ng/mL. In other sets of experiments, cells were treated with the JAK/
STAT inhibitor AG490 (Calbiochem) at 100 Amol/L, the MAPK inhibitor
PD098059 (Sigma) at 10 Amol/L, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell
Signaling) at 10 Amol/L along with leptin. Plates were photographed after 6,
12, and 24 h. All experiments were done at least six times.
ECIS wound-healing assays. Wound-healing assays were done with the
ECIS (Applied BioPhysics) technology (34, 35). For wound-healing assays,
confluent HepG2 and Huh7 monolayers cultured on ECIS plates were
submitted to an elevated voltage pulse of 40-kHz frequency, 3.5-V amplitude,
and 30-s duration, which led to death and detachment of cells present on
the small active electrode, resulting in a wound normally healed by cells
surrounding the small active electrode that have not been submitted to the
elevated voltage pulse. Wound healing was then assessed by continuous
resistance measurements for 24 h.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were independently done thrice in
triplicate. Data were analyzed using paired or unpaired Student’s t test, as
appropriate. Data were considered to be statistically significant if P < 0.05.
Data are expressed as mean F SE.

Results
Leptin augments proliferation and modulates cell cycle of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Leptin exerts its biological
functions through binding to its receptors that mediate a
downstream signal by activating multiple signaling pathways
(15). We first examined the expression of leptin receptors in
HepG2 and Huh7 cells. The expression of leptin receptor mRNA
and protein was examined using reverse transcription-PCR and
Western blot analysis. A predicted PCR product of Ob-Rb (long
isoform) was obtained as 1,071 bp and Ob-Rt (short isoform) as

273 bp by specific primers (Fig. 1A) in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells.
Immunoprecipitation was done using specific antibodies: Ob-R
(C-20; recognizes only the long form of leptin receptor) and Ob-R
(H-300; recognizes both long and short forms of leptin receptor)

Figure 1. Leptin receptors are expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and
hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissue from human. A, total RNA was extracted
from HepG2 and Huh7 cells and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR using
specific primers for long (Ob-Rb) and short (Ob-Rt) isoforms of leptin receptor.
Primer set for 18S RNA was used as a control. B, total protein was isolated from
HepG2 and Huh7 cells, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to
immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies for long and short forms of leptin
receptor. Immunoprecipitation with IgG was included as a negative control.
Twenty-five micrograms of COLO 320DM cell lysate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
were included as positive control. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using a mouse monoclonal
antibody against both long and short forms of leptin receptor. Long (Ob-Rb;
120 kDa) and short (Ob-Rt; 90 kDa) forms of leptin receptors were found to
be present in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. C, lysates from normal liver tissue
(surrounding liver metastases), peritumoral tissue, and three cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC ) on liver with cirrhosis were prepared. Equal
amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot
analysis using a mouse monoclonal antibody against the long form of leptin
receptor. The long form (Ob-Rb) of leptin receptors was found to be present in all
three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression was more in tumorous
tissues (T ) compared with peritumoral tissue (P). The normal liver tissue from
two cases (NHL 1 and 2) were negative for the presence of Ob-Rb. Lysate from
hepatic stellate cells (HSC ) was used as positive control. The Western blot
signals were quantified by densitometry (histogram) and normalized to h-actin.

followed by Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal Ob-R
(B-3; recognizes both long and short forms of leptin receptor).
Immunoprecipitates with specific antibodies show the presence of
both long and short forms of leptin receptor in HepG2 and Huh7
cells, whereas IgG controls do not (Fig. 1B). We also investigated
the expression levels of Ob-Rb in tumor, peritumoral, and normal
liver tissue samples obtained from patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma (Fig. 2C). Importantly, Ob-Rb was barely detectable in
normal human liver, whereas all three hepatocellular carcinoma
samples express high levels of Ob-Rb. Interestingly, Ob-Rb
expression was higher in the peritumoral tissue in comparison
with normal liver, whereas the tumor tissue showed the highest
level of Ob-Rb expression.
We next examined the effect of leptin on hepatocellular
carcinoma cell proliferation using BrdUrd incorporation analysis.
For these experiments, HepG2 and Huh7 cells were serum-starved
for 16 h followed by treatment with various concentrations (25–200
ng/mL) of recombinant human leptin for different time intervals
(12, 24, and 48 h). Leptin treatment stimulated the growth of
HepG2 and Huh7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
Substantial stimulation was observed at 24- and 48-h time intervals
after treatment of cells at 100 ng/mL leptin, whereas higher
concentrations were equally stimulatory (Fig. 2A).
Cell cycle analysis revealed that the proportion of both HepG2
and Huh7 cells was increased in S-phase by leptin treatment at
24 h compared with lower treatment periods, and cells were
subjected to serum-free conditions (Fig. 2B). D-type cyclins are
active in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. They complex with cyclindependent kinases to catalyze the transition from G1 to S phase of
the cell cycle (36). Leptin promotes proliferation of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells, and one of the targets for leptin action may be
cyclin D1. Under the treatment of leptin, the G1 arrest of cells was
reduced and was accompanied with up-regulation of G1 phase–
specific cyclin D1 (Fig. 2C) but down-regulation of cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 2D). Kruppel-like
factor (KLF5) is a cell growth mediator, and higher KLF5 increases
cell growth rate and leads to transformed phenotypes (37). Tumor
cell proliferation is tightly associated with tumor progression;
therefore, we examined the effect of leptin on the expression of
KLF5. Immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies against KLF5
showed an increase in the expression of KLF5 following leptin
treatment in HepG2 and Huh7 cells (Fig. 2E). Collectively, the
results showed that the proliferative effect of leptin on HepG2
and Huh7 cells was associated with the up-regulation of cyclin D1
and KLF5 and down-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1.
Leptin activates the JAK/STAT-PI3K/AKT-ERK axis in
growth stimulation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. To gain
insight into the mechanism underlying the proliferative effect of
leptin on hepatocellular carcinoma cells, we next examined the
changes in signal transduction pathways plausibly involved in
mediating leptin action. Previous studies have shown that leptin
activates JAK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates STATs
in other systems (15, 16). Total cellular proteins were extracted
from cells treated with 100 ng/mL leptin for various time periods,
and lysates were immunoblotted with a specific phosphorylated
tyrosine STAT3 antibody. STAT3 phosphorylation was stimulated
by 100 ng/mL of leptin in a time-dependent manner, resulting in an
increase in STAT3 phosphorylation within 30 min of treatment
(Fig. 3A). Immunoblots were reprobed with antibodies against

Leptin and Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Figure 2. Leptin is mitogenic for
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. A, HepG2
and Huh7 cells were serum-starved for
16 h followed by treatment with 25 to
200 ng/mL leptin for 12, 24, and 48 h.
BrdUrd incorporation assays were then
done as described in Materials and
Methods. Leptin treatment increased
proliferation of HepG2 and Huh7 cells in
a time- and dose-dependent manner. *,

the fraction of HepG2 and Huh7 cells in the
S phase of the cell cycle. Cells were
synchronized by serum starvation in a
medium containing 0.1% serum for 16 h.
Serum-starved cells were exposed to
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF ;
30 ng/mL) or leptin (100 ng/mL) for various
time intervals (8, 12, and 24 h) or control
serum-free media (0.1% FBS). After each
time interval, the distribution of both HepG2
and Huh7 cells in the cell cycle was
determined by flow cytometry using
propidium iodide–stained nuclei.
The results indicate the distribution of

the presence of 100 ng/mL leptin for 6 and

normalized for protein content; 100 Ag of
protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE

further examined the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT after
stimulating the cells with 100 ng of leptin for various intervals of
time. An increased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was observed
within 1 h after leptin treatment followed by a decline (Fig. 3B
and C). Leptin had no effect on total ERK and AKT protein
expression levels.
Next, to investigate if activation of the JAK/STAT-PI3K/AKT-ERK
axis is directly involved in leptin-induced proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, we studied the effect of pharmacologic
inhibitors of JAK/STAT (AG490), ERK (PD098059), and PI3K
(LY294002) on leptin-induced stimulation of proliferation. Treatment of cells with AG490 decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3
significantly without affecting the expression of total STAT3

protein (Fig. 4A), whereas PD098059 and LY294002 did not affect
the phosphorylation of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, both
PD098059 and LY294002 specifically inhibited the phosphorylation
of ERK and AKT, respectively, without affecting the expression of
total ERK and AKT (Fig. 4B and C) or levels of phosphorylated
STAT3 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, treatment with the JAK/STAT
inhibitor AG490 blocked leptin-induced hyperphosphorylation of
both ERK and AKT (Fig. 4B and C). Importantly, simultaneous
treatment with leptin and AG490 could not restore the level
of phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 4A) or ERK (Fig. 4B) or Akt
(Fig. 4C), as achieved by treatment with leptin alone. These data
suggest that activation of JAK/STAT is upstream of the activation
of the ERK and AKT pathways, revealing the hierarchy of these

events. Examination of cell proliferation in these treatment
conditions clearly showed that blocking STAT3 phosphorylation
significantly reduced the growth stimulation of HepG2 and Huh7
cells by leptin (Fig. 4D), indicating that the activation of STAT3 is
essential for the cell-proliferative effect of leptin in hepatocellular
carcinoma. In addition, blocking ERK and AKT phosphorylation
significantly reduced the growth stimulation of HepG2 and Huh7
cells by leptin (Fig. 4D).
Leptin promotes the invasive potential of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. Invasion and metastasis are the key biological
features of carcinoma cell behavior (38). As Ob-Rb receptors are
connected with several signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer progression (15), we addressed
the question of whether leptin may participate in the regulation of
invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma progression. For an in vitro
model system for metastasis (30), we used a Matrigel invasion
chamber (Becton Dickinson). In the absence of leptin, the invasion
was very low. With 100 ng/mL leptin in the bottom chamber,
significantly greater numbers of HepG2 and Huh7 cells invaded

through Matrigel-coated inserts towards the bottom chamber
(Fig. 5A). H&E staining of invaded HepG2 and Huh7 cells exhibited
a remarkable invasion in response to 100 ng/mL leptin (Fig. 5A).
Next, we examined the contribution of the JAK/STAT-PI3K/AKTERK kinases in leptin-induced increased invasiveness. Treatment
with the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002,
and the ERK inhibitor PD098059 significantly inhibited the
invasiveness induced by 100 ng/mL leptin in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells (Fig. 5A).
Next, we did a quantitative real-time impedance assay using an
ECIS-based technique (32) to follow the invasive activities of
HepG2 and Huh7 cells in culture. This assay is based on the
microscopic observations that metastatic cells attach and invade
the established confluent layer of HUVECs on small gold electrodes. First, the initial attachment and spreading of this lot of HUVEC
cells were analyzed via time course impedance changes (data not
shown). Electrodes were followed from the time of inoculation
(time 0) to 24 h after inoculation. The initial increase in the curve
due to cell attachment and spreading increased the resistive

HepG2 and Huh7 cells were cultured,
serum-starved for 16 h, and treated with
leptin (100 ng/mL) for various time
intervals. Time 0 represents the absence
of leptin or untreated cells. Cell lysates
were prepared and quantified for protein
content. A total of 100 Ag protein was
resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed
by immunoblot analysis with specific
antibodies against total or phosphorylated
forms of STAT3 (A), ERK (B), and AKT
(C). The representative histogram is the

completed in f2.5 h, and the resistance fluctuations resulting
from the movement or undulations of the established cell sheet
constraining the current were evident. Next, the established
HUVEC cell layers were challenged with HepG2 and Huh7 cells.
The decrease in resistance of the wells challenged with the HepG2
and Huh7 cells showed direct interactions of the challenger cells
resulting from retraction of the endothelial cell junctions and
extravasation of the HepG2 and Huh7 cells on the substratum
(Fig. 5B–D). Importantly, leptin-treated cells showed substantial

steeper decrease in impedance than no treatment controls, clearly
showing that leptin increases the invasive potential of both HepG2
and Huh7 cells (Fig. 5B–D). Next, we sought to determine the effect
of inhibitors of JAK/STAT-PI3K/AKT-ERK on the leptin-induced
increased invasiveness of HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Treatment with
the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490 (Fig. 5B), the ERK inhibitor
PD098059 (Fig. 5C), and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5D)
significantly inhibited the invasiveness induced by 100 ng/mL

enables tumor cells to migrate to points far from a given primary
tumor mass, leading to metastasis (39). We analyzed the effect of
leptin on migration potential of HepG2 and Huh7 cells by using a
migration assay. The movement of HepG2 and Huh7 cells across
the scratched area of the cell monolayer indicates the migration
of cells in a process independent of proliferation (40). As shown in
Fig. 6A, both HepG2 and Huh7 cells cultured in the presence of
leptin migrated rapidly and covered the wound in 12 h compared
with the untreated controls. The ability of cells to migrate was
significantly reduced when they were treated with the JAK/STAT
inhibitor AG490 in the presence of leptin. Treatment of HepG2 and
Huh7 cells with the ERK inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 6A) and the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 6A) also impaired the migration potential
but not to the extent of inhibition achieved by AG490.

Next, we did ECIS based wound-healing assays for a quantitative
determination of effect of leptin on migration potential of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. HepG2 and Huh7 cells cultured on
ECIS 8W1E plates were subjected to an elevated voltage pulse of 40kHz frequency, 3.5-V amplitude for 30 s duration, and resistance was
measured for 24 h. The application of the high-field pulse led to a
drastic decrease of cell resistance (Fig. 6B). HepG2 and Huh7 cells
treated with leptin showed increased resistance to reach the
resistance values of the nonwounded cells at the start of the
experiment, whereas untreated cells did not. Interestingly, HepG2
and Huh7 cells treated with the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490, the ERK
inhibitor PD098059, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 along with
100 ng leptin did not reach the resistance values of the nonwounded
cells, indicating significant inhibition of leptin-induced migration in

A, both HepG2 and Huh7 cells were grown

scratched with a pipette tip. The plates
were photographed immediately following
scratching. Culture media were replaced
with control media (media containing
100 ng/mL leptin). For combined treatment,
cells were pretreated with 100 Amol/L

subjected to an elevated voltage pulse of

30 s. The wound was then allowed to heal
from cells surrounding the small active
electrode that did not undergo the elevated

the presence of chemical inhibitors for the JAK/STAT-PI3K/
AKT-ERK kinase pathway. Our demonstration that inhibition of
the JAK/STAT-PI3K/AKT-ERK kinase pathway abrogates leptininduced invasion of Matrigel and migration (scratch-wound healing)
confirmed that the activity of these pathways is indeed a crucial
component of the signaling machinery used by the leptin receptor in
promoting malignant properties of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Discussion
Increasing epidemiologic data in humans and many in vitro
investigative reports have linked obesity with various disease states
and suggested a strong link between leptin and cancer growth.
Several reports have described a mitogenic effect of leptin on
gastric (40), breast (4), ovarian (41), prostate (42), and endometrial
(30) cancer cells. However, it inhibits the growth of pancreatic
carcinoma (43), suggesting a differential response of various cancer
cells to leptin treatment. Hepatocellular carcinoma showed the

www.aacrjournals.org

highest relative risk increase in association with obesity compared
with all the cancers studied, including prostate, kidney, gallbladder,
colon, rectum, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas (22–26). A recent
clinical study examining obesity as an independent risk factor for
hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis who underwent
transplantation concluded that obesity is indeed a statistically
significant independent risk factor after multivariate analysis (27).
Interestingly, leptin was reported to induce a significant suppression of human hepatocellular carcinoma via induction of natural
killer cell proliferation and activation in a murine model. However,
the use of athymic mouse model does not exclude additional
leptin-mediated effects on regulatory T-cell population or effector
cells (44). Recently, high leptin expression was associated with an
increased intratumor microvessel density and hepatocellular
carcinoma development (45). Leptin-mediated neovascularization
coordinated with vascular endothelial growth factor playing an
important role in the development of liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis in NASH (46). However, the direct role of leptin

in hepatocellular carcinoma progression and the elucidation of
signaling pathways involved have never been deciphered. Thus, in
the present study, the expression of leptin receptor in HepG2 and
Huh7 cells was investigated. Both short and long isoforms of leptin
receptors were observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells,
suggesting that leptin may be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma.
This hypothesis is supported by the observation that Ob-Rb is
expressed in tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma, and that expression levels are higher than in the noninvolved counterpart. In the United States and Europe, hepatocellular carcinoma arises in more than 80% of cases on a cirrhotic
liver. Accordingly, all three patients analyzed in this study had
cirrhosis in the peritumoral liver tissue. Remarkably, Ob-Rb levels
were also higher in tissue with cirrhosis than in normal liver tissue,
supporting the proposed role of leptin signaling in the development of liver fibrosis.
As a first attempt to elucidate the signaling pathways involved
in leptin-mediated induction of cancerous properties of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, we examined the effect of leptin on the
activation of the JAK/STAT-AKT-ERK pathway. Our experiments
clearly showed that leptin rapidly stimulates the JAK/STAT
pathway and induced the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, thus
activating these key signal transduction pathways associated with
cell growth. In addition, prevention of leptin-induced activation of
JAK/STAT with chemical inhibitors in turn significantly reduced
the activation of both the ERK and AKT pathways. Importantly,
leptin induced the invasive and migration potential of both HepG2
and Huh7 cells. Inhibition of these pathways with specific chemical
inhibitors not only decreases the invasive potential but also
blocked hepatocellular carcinoma cell migration. Thus, we
deciphered in this report that leptin is directly involved in the
augmentation of invasion and migration potential of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells. In addition, in the present study, it is clear that
leptin can trigger invasion and migration of hepatocellular
carcinoma cells via a pathway involving the JAK/STAT-AKT-ERK
axis as pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway abolished leptininduced invasiveness and migration significantly.
Our studies represent the first steps towards understanding
the molecular mechanisms of leptin action in hepatocellular
carcinoma. Recent studies have shown that the ERK pathway is
an attractive target for therapeutic intervention due to its integral
role in the regulation of proliferation, invasiveness, and survival of
tumors (47). Multiple studies with small interfering RNAs and
pharmacologic inhibitors have shown the importance of ERK
blockade, and several agents that target this pathway are already
undergoing clinical testing, and some have already shown promise
in clinical trials (48). AKT provides a survival signal protecting cells

from apoptosis induced by various stresses by multiple mechanisms, such as the phosphorylation of Bad, glycogen synthase-3,
forkhead transcription factor, and caspase-9 (49, 50). Phosphorylation of these proteins results in inactivation of their apoptotic
functions. As shown in our report, AKT phosphorylation was
increased in leptin-treated human hepatocellular carcinoma cells,
and inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 abolished leptin-induced
proliferation. LY294002 has been tested in an ectopic skin and
orthotopic brain tumor model and has been shown to inhibit
glioma tumor growth (51). It has also shown efficacy against
ovarian carcinoma (52). In addition, more potent AKT inhibitors,
such as small-molecule inhibitor API-59CJ-OMe (9-methoxy-2methylellipticinium acetate; ref. 53), are being developed.
Importantly, our studies not only implicate the AKT and ERK
survival pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation
and invasion, but we also report that inhibition of the JAK/STAT
pathway significantly reduced the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK
and proliferation mediated via these pathways, suggesting that
JAK/STAT acts upstream of ERK and AKT. STAT3 is frequently
found to be either constitutively activated or activated in response
to specific stimuli. Multiple strategies have been used to block
STAT activation, including indirect and direct approaches.
Tyrphostin AG490 has been implicated in inhibition of proliferation
of human acute lymphocytic leukemia (54) and human myeloma
cells (55). A recent study reported that introduction of antisense
STAT3 oligodeoxynucleotide specifically blocked expression of
STAT3 mRNA in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell
lines inhibiting proliferation (56). In addition, a small-molecule
inhibitor (STA21) discovered through virtual database screening
was found to inhibit human breast cancer cells expressing
constitutively active STAT3 (57).
In summary, our data for the first time deciphered the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the leptin-mediated hepatocellular
carcinoma cell proliferation, establishing direct association between obesity and hepatocellular carcinogenesis and presenting
involvement of key molecules of multiple signaling pathways.
