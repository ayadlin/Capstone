BACKGROUND: During chemotherapy, some colorectal liver metastases (LMs) disappear on serial imaging. This disappearance may represent a complete response (CR) or a reduction in the sensitivity of imaging during chemotherapy. The objective of the current study was to determine the fate of disappearing LMs (DLMs) and the factors that
predict a true CR. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2003, 435 patients who were evaluated by hepatobiliary surgeons
received chemotherapy before they were considered for resection. Inclusion criteria were <12 LMs before chemotherapy, at least 1 DLM on a computed tomography (CT) scan, and either surgical resection or 1 year of clinical follow-up
after the disappearance of LMs. A true CR was defined as either a pathologic CR (no tumor detected in the resection
specimen) or a durable clinical CR (did not reappear on follow-up imaging). Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed to identify those associated with a true CR. RESULTS: During chemotherapy, 39 patients (9%) had a total of 118
DLMs on follow-up CT scans. Sixty-eight DLMs were resected, and 50 were followed clinically. Overall, 75 DLMs (64%)
were true CRs, including 44 pathologic CRs and 31 durable clinical CRs. On multivariate analysis, the use of hepatic
arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 6.2; P ¼ .02), the inability to observe the DLM on a magnetic
resonance image (OR, 4.7; P ¼ .005), and normalization of serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (OR, 4.6; P ¼ .006)
were associated independently with a true CR. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 66% of DLMs represented a true CR
according to assessment by resection or radiologic follow-up. Predictive factors may help to stratify patients who are

Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of patients who have unresectable liver metastases (LMs) from colorectal

cancer to prolong survival and potentially to render these LMs resectable.1,2 It also has been used in the neoadjuvant setting before surgery for resectable LMs.3,4 A few LMs are disappearing LMs (DLMs) and are not observed on serial imaging
studies during chemotherapy; however, the relation between this radiologic complete response (CR) and the pathologic
response, as assessed in the surgical specimen, remains uncertain. Even less well defined is the fate of the DLMs that are followed radiographically.
When an LM is present in a segment of the liver that cannot be resected easily, the disappearance of this lesion during
chemotherapy may preclude accurate ablative or resectional treatment, potentially jeopardizing a curative resection. Moreover, in some patients, resection is considered only because an LM disappeared during chemotherapy; however, in these
patients, resection is only effective if the DLM, in fact, is a true CR.
Although 3 studies5-7 have evaluated the outcome of DLM, the results are discrepant. In addition, to our knowledge,
no study has evaluated the factors that may predict the true nature of a DLM. The current study was undertaken to determine the fate of DLMs on serial computed tomography (CT) scanning during chemotherapy. Specifically, we sought to

define the proportion of DLMs that represented a pathologic CR after resection or a durable clinical CR on clinical follow-up and to identify the clinicopathologic factors
associated with a true CR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Approval to conduct the current study was obtained from
the Institutional Review Board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). The institutional
database of patients who were evaluated by a hepatobiliary
surgeon was queried to identify 435 patients with LMs who
received chemotherapy before they were considered for hepatic resection between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
2003. This group included 1) patients with resectable LMs
who were receiving chemotherapy because of synchronous
presentation with a colorectal primary or a high clinical risk
score,8 2) patients with unresectable LMs because of their
number or location relative to blood vessels, and 3) patients
with LMs and a single resectable extrahepatic metastasis
(such as a single pulmonary metastasis). Of these 435
patients who were receiving chemotherapy, 39 patients
were included because they met the following criteria: 1)
<12 LMs before chemotherapy, 2) at least 1 DLM on a
CT scan, 3) surgical resection of the hepatic segment(s) that
harbored the DLM(s), or 4) clinical and radiologic followup for at least 1 year after LM disappearance.
Follow-Up and Definition of Outcomes
After LM disappearance, patients were followed every 2
weeks while they were receiving chemotherapy and every

2 to 6 months thereafter with abdominal CT scans every 2
to 12 months. A DLM was defined as a lesion that was
detected on a prechemotherapy CT scan that subsequently disappeared on follow-up CT scans. A DLM was
considered a pathologic CR if no tumor was detected in
the resection specimen or was considered a durable clinical CR if it did not recur on follow-up imaging studies for
at least 1 year (Fig. 1). The association of clinical and
pathologic factors with a true CR (pathologic and durable
clinical CR) was analyzed to determine which factors were
predictive of a true CR.
Hepatic Imaging Investigations
All patients were evaluated preoperatively with a contrast-enhanced CT scan that was available for review at
our institution. All patients were evaluated with serial
CT scans during chemotherapy and after the completion of between 1 month and 12 months of therapy.
The follow-up and prechemotherapy CT scans were
compared, and a radiologic CR was defined as disappearance of the LM with no residual abnormality, such
as an area of low attenuation, enhancement, or calcification, at the site of a known LM. Additional imaging
studies before chemotherapy and after disappearance of
the LM were obtained at the discretion of the treating
oncologist.
Chemotherapy Regimens
The chemotherapy administered before LM disappearance included intravenous fluorouracil and leucovorin
(FU/LV), oxaliplatin, irinotecan (CPT-11), and hepatic

arterial infusion of floxuridine (HAI FUDR) either alone
or in combination (Table 1). No patient received bevacizumab or cetuximab as part of their chemotherapy regimen before LM disappearance. The chemotherapy was a
first-line regimen in 35 patients (90%) and a second-line
regimen in 4 patients (10%). Postoperative chemotherapy
was continued at the discretion of the treating oncologist.
The postdisappearance chemotherapy regimens among
the 21 patients who had DLMs followed clinically are
outlined in Table 1.
Surgical Exploration, Hepatic Resection,
and Pathologic Assessment
All patients were reviewed at a multidisciplinary meeting to determine resectability. At the time of surgery,
the liver was mobilized and inspected visually, by palpation, and by intraoperative ultrasound (7.5 MHz;
Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) with specific attention to segments of the liver where DLMs had been present. Visible LMs were resected completely or were treated with
intraoperative radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy after a core biopsy (Table 1). The standard procedure was
to resect all sites of DLMs. For patients in whom resection of DLMs would result in an insufficient hepatic
remnant, only visible LMs were resected or ablated, and
the DLMs were left in the remnant liver. The macroscopic liver specimens were examined at 0.5-cm intervals for the number, size, and location of LMs and for
the presence of microscopic viable tumor cells, necrosis,
calcifications, or benign liver lesions. Tumor nodules
were submitted for paraffin embedding as 3-mm-thick
slices, and each block had a representative section examined histologically.
Statistical Analysis
Univariate statistical comparisons between groups were
performed using the Student t test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for discrete variables. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify
clinical features that were predictive of a true CR. The
time to LM disappearance (calculated from the initiation of chemotherapy) and the time to LM recurrence
(calculated from the first disappearance of the lesion)
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Averages are reported as means  standard deviations. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value .05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

Figure 2. This flow chart summarizes the outcome of 118 disappearing liver metastases (DLMs). Among these DLMs, a
pathologic complete response (CR) was detected in 44 liver
metastases (LMs) (37%), and a durable clinical CR was noted
in 31 LMs (26%), for a true CR in 75 LMs (63% of DLMs). The
single asterisk indicates that the mean time to disease recurrence was 21 months (12 months), and the double asterisks
indicate that the mean follow-up for LMs that did not recur
was 41 months (13 months). OR indicates operating room.

RESULTS
Overall True CR
Of the 435 patients who received chemotherapy, 39
patients (9%) had DLMs and were the focus of the current study. These 39 patients had a total of 166 LMs,
including 118 LMs that disappeared on follow-up CT
scans. Overall, the true CR rate among DLMs was 75 of
118 (64%), including 44 CRs (59%) that were confirmed
by pathologic assessment and 31 CRs (41%) that were
confirmed by clinical follow-up. Of all 118 DLMs, 44 of
68 resected DLMs proved to be pathologic CRs, and 31
of 50 DLMs that were followed with serial imaging
proved to be durable clinical CRs (Fig. 2).
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of all 39 patients and their LMs (166
total LMs/118 DLMs) are detailed in Table 1. The predisappearance chemotherapy regimens varied, but the majority of patients received CPT-11 combined with 5-FU/LV
(54%). Seven patients (18%) received HAI FUDR combined with systemic CPT-11. The mean number of
DLMs per patient was 3.0  2.2 DLMs. The mean DLM
size was 1.6  0.9 cm compared with 4.6  2.0 cm for
LMs that remained visible. In 23 patients, every lesion
that was present on the initial CT scan disappeared during
chemotherapy. The mean time from initiation of chemotherapy to LM disappearance was 5.8  4.0 months, and
90% of LMs disappeared by 9.0 months (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. These charts illustrate Kaplan-Meier distributions for
lesion disappearance and lesion recurrence. (Top) The median time to disappearance among 118 liver metastases (LMs)
was 5 months, and 90% disappeared by 9 months. (Bottom)
The median time to lesion recurrence when the patients were
off chemotherapy was not reached among 50 patients with
LM who were followed clinically. Nineteen disappearing LMs
(DLMs) recurred (38%), all within 20 months of the withdrawal of chemotherapy. DLMs that recurred during chemotherapy were considered to have recurred at 0 months.

Additional Imaging of DLMs
Additional imaging was undertaken for 89 of the 118
DLMs (75%) in 27 patients. The additional studies
included positron emission tomography (PET) in 54
LMs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 44 LMs,
transabdominal ultrasound (US) in 29 LMs, and CT portography in 25 LMs. Overall, of 7 LMs (8%) that were

detected at the site of disappearance, 6 were detected by
MRI, and 1 was detected by PET. In each patient, the
presence of the LM was confirmed pathologically at the
time of surgical exploration. These 7 LMs were included
in the group of 68 LMs that were resected and proved to
be carcinoma (Fig. 2).
Surgical Assessment of DLMs
Of all 118 DLMs, 102 (including the 7 LMs that were
identified on additional imaging studies) were evaluated
in the operating room. Of those 102 DLMs, 68 (67%)
were included in the surgical resection specimen, and 24
(35% of the 68) demonstrated viable carcinoma. The
remaining 44 LMs (65% of the 68) had no viable tumor
and were considered pathologic CRs. Eleven of the 102
DLMs that were evaluated at operation (11%) were apparent macroscopically (10 by palpation and 1 by intraoperative US), but only 6 had microscopic evidence of disease
on final pathology. It is noteworthy that 4 of the LMs
detected at the time of surgery were not resected but were
treated with radiofrequency ablation. Those 4 LMs were
biopsied before treatment, and no viable tumor was
detected. They were considered pathologic CRs (Fig. 2).
Radiologic Follow-Up of DLMs
Fifty of the 118 DLMs (42%) were followed clinically
with serial cross-sectional imaging. Of these 50 LMs, 16
(32%) were not evaluated in the operating room, and 34
(68%) were not visible and were left in situ at the time of
surgery (Table 2, Fig. 2). The mean follow-up after disappearance for all 50 DLMs that were followed clinically
was 40.7  13.0 months and did not differ significantly
between LMs that were evaluated in the operating room
and LMs that were followed clinically. The mean follow-

1506

up for the 31 LMs that did not reappear during clinical
follow-up was 40.8  13.0 months (range, 37-48
months). Overall, 31 of 50 DLMs (62%) that were followed with serial imaging represented durable clinical
CRs.
The majority of DLMs were treated with postdisappearance chemotherapy (45 DLMs; 18 patients) for a
mean duration of 18 months (range, 8-41 months).
Among the 5 LMs in patients who did not receive postdisappearance chemotherapy, 4 recurred (80%); and, in the
patients who received chemotherapy, 15 of 45 DLMs
recurred (33%; P ¼ .04). There was no association
between the type of postdisappearance chemotherapy and
DLM recurrence (data not shown). Chemotherapy was
stopped for 15 of 31 LMs (48%) that were identified as
durable clinical CRs, and the mean follow-up for those
patients was 10.0  13.6 months after stopping chemotherapy. The median time to LM recurrence off chemotherapy was not reached among all 50 LMs; however, the
19 LMs that recurred all did so within 20 months of stopping chemotherapy (Fig. 3).
Predictors of True CR
In univariate analysis, DLMs were significantly more
likely to represent true CRs when the surrounding liver
was not steatotic, when the patient’s body mass index was
<30 kg/m2, when LMs could not be detected on an MRI
that was obtained after disappearance, when the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level normalized during chemotherapy, and when the LMs were treated with HAI
chemotherapy. In the entire cohort of 118 DLMs, treatment with CPT-11 (96 DLMs) was associated with a significantly higher number of true CRs (68% with CPT-11
vs 42% without CPT-11; P ¼ .03) (Tables 2 and 3).

Neither the size of the DLM, nor preoperative portal vein
embolization, nor evaluation of the LMs in the operating
room was significantly associated with a true CR. In multivariate analysis, normalization of the CEA level, inability
to detect the lesion by MRI, and the use of HAI chemotherapy were associated independently with a true CR
(Tables 2 and 3, Fig. 4).

(DLM) was significantly more likely to represent a true CR
when a postdisappearance magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scan was performed, when the body mass index (BMI)
was <30 kg/m2, when the liver was not steatotic, when the
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was normalized, and
after hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIP). The numbers above each bar represent the DLMs that were found

Recurrence and Survival
Seventeen of 39 patients (44%) with DLMs developed a
recurrence in the liver, and an additional 8 patients (21%)
developed a recurrence at an extrahepatic site. At a median
follow-up of 40 months, 17 patients (44%) remained free
of disease (3 patients underwent an additional hepatic
resection), 16 patients (41%) were alive with disease, and
6 patients (15%) had died of disease. The 5-year overall
predicted survival rate was 65%, and the median survival
had not been reached. Among the 7 patients did not
undergo exploration in the operating room, 2 patients
remained disease free at 15 months and 41 months of

1507

Original Article

follow-up, 2 patients had died of disease at 16 months
and 37 months, and 3 patients remained alive with disease
at 18 months, 30 months, and 37 months. The patient
who remained free of disease without resection at 41
months received combined HAI and systemic chemotherapy and has been off chemotherapy for 2 years. The survival of 18 patients who had DLMs that were identified as
true CRs did not differ significantly from the survival of
21 patients who had DLMs that were not true CRs (median overall survival, 54 months and 56 months, respectively; P ¼ .3).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, approximately 66% of DLMs that
disappeared during chemotherapy represented true CRs,
including DLMs that were resected surgically and those
that were followed clinically. Factors like the use of HAI
chemotherapy, normalization of the CEA level, and verification of disappearance by MRI were useful in determining the probability that a DLM represented a true CR.
Our results are in agreement with those published
by Elias et al.6,7 In their first series,7 54 DLMs were identified in 15 patients. In 4 of those patients (27%), the
LMs were identified at laparotomy, whereas reappearance
of the LMs occurred in 3 other patients (20%). The
remaining 8 patients (53%) did not develop any recurrence of the DLMs after a median follow-up of 31
months. In the second series,6 69 DLMs (16 patients)
were left in situ after surgical exploration. During a mean
follow-up of 51 months, DLMs did not reappear in 10
patients (62%). By contrast, Benoist et al5 evaluated 66
LMs that disappeared during chemotherapy in 38 patients
and observed macroscopic persistence at laparotomy in
20 DLMs (30%), microscopic residual disease in 12 of
15 DLMs (18%), and early recurrence in situ in 23 of 31
DLMs (35%). Overall, those authors observed evidence
of residual cancer in 83% of DLMs. These conflicting
results probably are explained by differences in the imaging modalities and chemotherapy drugs that were used in
those studies.
In the study by Benoist et al, patients were evaluated
by helical CT scans and US studies; whereas, in the studies
by Elias et al, patients also underwent imaging with MRI.
In our current study, 44 DLMs (37%) were evaluated
after their disappearance with MRI, which detected 6
LMs that were not observed on CT scans (15%). In
addition, only 26% of LMs that disappeared on both CT
scans and MRI studies were detected at surgery or

1508

recurred during follow-up compared with 43% of LMs
that were not evaluated by MRI. In a meta-analysis of
imaging techniques for colorectal LMs,9 MRI with intravenous contrast was significantly more sensitive than helical CT. MRI may be particularly useful in the setting of
chemotherapy-induced hepatic steatosis, which may be
responsible for some DLMs.10,11 Another difference
between studies was the chemotherapy regimen. Patients
in the study by Benoist et al5 received intravenous chemotherapy, whereas Elias et al gave their patients a combination of systemic and HAI chemotherapy. In the study by
Elias et al,6 patients who received HAI chemotherapy
were more likely to have a pathologic CR compared with
patients who received systemic chemotherapy (86% vs
22%; P<.02). These results agree with our findings that
only 14% of LMs that disappeared during HAI chemotherapy either were identified at laparotomy or recurred
during follow-up compared with 42% of LMs that disappeared during systemic chemotherapy (P ¼ .01) and that
HAI chemotherapy was an independent predictor of a
true CR. Although the number of true CRs among DLMs
was very high in patients who received HAI chemotherapy
(86%), the number of true CRs with systemic chemotherapy alone still was higher than that reported previously
(58%).

DLMs that are left in the hepatic remnant may be important. In the study by Elias et al,6 none of the DLMs
recurred among the 6 patients who received postoperative
HAI chemotherapy compared with 8 of 11 patients who
received either systemic chemotherapy (6 patients) or no
chemotherapy (5 patients). In our study, almost all DLMs
(4 of 5) recurred in patients who did not receive postdisappearance chemotherapy, whereas only one-third of
DLMs recurred in patients who received chemotherapy.
However, we did not observe a difference between the
types of postdisappearance chemotherapy.
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature.
Although the database is prospective, patients did not
undergo standardized follow-up as part of a prospective
protocol, and the database does not include information
on each individual LM for review. Patients were followed
with imaging studies at variable intervals; and, although
the protocol that was used for CT imaging of the liver was
similar, it was not identical in each patient. In addition,
sampling error of the surgical specimen may have lead to
the incorrect designation of a pathologic CR and an overestimate of the incidence of true CRs. Finally, the study
period extended from 2000 to 2003; therefore, none of

the patients received biologic agents. The incidence of
DLMs and true CRs may be different in the era of biologics: Recent studies have demonstrated improved response
rates and higher complete resection (R0) rates in patients
who receive a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy
and cetuximab or bevacizumab.12 A strength of the current study, unlike the study by Benoist et al,5 is that it
included both patients who underwent surgical exploration and those who were followed clinically. It is important to note that the true CR rate was similar among
DLMs that were followed clinically and those that were
resected (62% vs 72%, respectively), suggesting that these
represent similar phenomena.
Despite a more favorable true CR rate in our study
than what was reported previously,5 it still is prudent to
resect all initial sites of DLM when possible. In some
patients, radiologic disappearance may impair the ability
of the surgeon to treat an LM, because the exact site may
not be localized accurately at the time of surgery. For this
reason, patients should be followed closely during neoadjuvant chemotherapy if the intent is to resect all LMs at
the time of surgery. In the current study, the median time
to the disappearance of LMs was 5 months, and 25% disappeared within 3 months. In some patients, if a followup CT scan had been obtained at an early time point after
the initiation of chemotherapy, then the DLM still may
have been visible. If an LM already has disappeared, then
we recommend preoperative imaging with an MRI,
because MRI was able to identify approximately 15% of
DLMs in our study. A technique using coils to localize
small, central LMs that are at risk of disappearing before
the initiation of systemic chemotherapy also has been
described.13
Patients with initially unresectable colorectal LM
may become surgical candidates after chemotherapy only
when a DLM represents a true CR, because it would not
be possible otherwise to remove the DLM from the liver
remnant. The current study demonstrates that 63% of
DLMs represent a true CR, as assessed pathologically in
resected specimens or by radiologic follow-up. Predictive
factors, such as inability to detect the DLM on MRI imaging, the use of HAI chemotherapy, and normalization of
CEA levels, can help predict the likelihood of residual disease and guide surgical approaches.
