Abstract
Dietary restriction can prolong life and delay the onset of cancer. Suppressing the signalling pathway
that is mediated by the hormone insulin might be crucial for the anticancer effects of reduced caloric
intake.

It is well established that dietary restriction, which involves limiting nutrient intake below
normal levels but without reaching malnutrition, extends lifespan in most, if not all, species
— probably including humans1. This amazing benefit is likely to be due to the evolutionary
advantage of keeping alive under suboptimal nutrient availability, and postponing reproduction
until food is plentiful. On the basis of this evolutionary hypothesis, dietary restriction should
prolong not only lifespan, but also youthfulness. Indeed, in both rodents and humans, limiting
caloric intake delays many age-associated traits and diseases, including cognitive deterioration
and cancer2,3. But dietary restriction does not affect all types of cancer similarly4, raising
questions about the generality of its effects and its mode of action in cancer. Writing in this
issue, Kalaany and Sabatini5 (page 725) address these questions in both human tumour cells
and animal models of human cancer.
The authors find that, when human-tumour cell lines are implanted into mice, some lines cannot
expand if the animals’ caloric intake is reduced by 40% for a period of 3 weeks. Intriguingly,
the cell lines that were resistant to the antitumour benefits of this nutrient restriction carried
mutations that led to the constitutive (continuous) activation of the signalling pathway mediated
by the hormone insulin. Specifically, these cell lines had mutations that activated the enzyme
PI3K, a key component of the insulin signalling pathway, or inactivated PTEN phosphatase,
an enzyme that counteracts PI3K action. So it seems that, to exert its anticancer benefits, limited
dietary intake must reduce insulin-mediated signalling.

To investigate whether reducing the activity of the insulin3PI3K pathway was indeed required
for mediating the effects of dietary restriction, Kalaany and Sabatini next studied the
consequences of short-term limitations in food intake on mice that had been genetically
engineered to develop tumours with either a constitutively active PI3K pathway or constitutive
activation of other oncogenic signalling pathways. Strikingly, only tumours with an active
PI3K pathway were resistant to dietary restriction. What’s more, activating this pathway was
both necessary and sufficient for tumour resistance to reduced food intake. Finally, the FOXO
proteins, which are major downstream targets of the PI3K signalling pathway and affect gene
transcription, seem to execute the effects of dietary restriction, as FOXO transcription factors
were inactivated in the tumours resistant to reduced nutrient intake (Fig. 1).
In search of a cellular mechanism to explain the effect of dietary restriction on tumours,
Kalaany and Sabatini found that, in these tumour cells, there was an increase in programmed
cell death (apoptosis). Further studies on how dietary restriction reduces tumour growth in
vivo will be needed to explain whether it acts solely on the tumour itself, on the tumour
microenvironment, or on both. Indeed, reduced food intake could affect other cellular processes

that contribute to tumour size. For instance, it might inhibit cell proliferation; it could trigger
autophagy, a ‘self-eating’ cellular process that would help to recycle nutrients and ward off
cancer by eliminating damaged proteins or organelles; or it might help to reduce the growth of
new blood vessels in tumours — a process known as angiogenesis — thus affecting the tumour
microenvironment rather than the tumour cells.
It would be informative to compare Kalaany and Sabatini’s data5 with previous observations
on the mechanisms of dietary-restriction-induced longevity and tumour suppression in other
species6. Studies in yeast and worms have revealed various signalling pathways that mediate
the effects of reduced food intake on longevity — including those involving the Sir2 family of
deacetylase enzymes7,8, the FOXA/pha-4 (ref. 9) and NRF2/skn-1 (ref. 10) transcription
factors, and the AMPK (ref. 11), TOR (ref. 12) and Rheb (ref. 13) signalling molecules.
Curiously, the insulin–PI3K–FOXO pathway was not essential for the effect of dietary
restriction on longevity in most, although not all11,13, of the studies. So how can these findings
be reconciled with those of Kalaany and Sabatini?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There could be several explanations. First, compared with invertebrates, mammals may be
more dependent on normal insulin signalling to extract maximum benefit from dietary
restriction in relation to longevity and tumour resistance. Indeed, mutation of the growthhormone receptor, which affects the production of insulin-like growth factor, interferes with
dietary-restriction-induced longevity in mice14. Second, reduced insulin-mediated signalling
resulting from a decrease in food intake may be even more important for fighting off cancer
than for extending lifespan. In mice, for example, NRF2/skn-1 mediates the effects of dietary
restriction on cancer but not on longevity15. Third, the methods that researchers use to restrict
dietary intake in invertebrates may expose pathways other than that mediated by insulin.
Reduced food intake probably engages several pathways that cooperate to prolong lifespan and
prevent cancer. Understanding how these pathways regulate longevity and age-dependent traits
will be crucial for harnessing the full benefits of nutrient restriction.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is worth noting that Kalaany and Sabatini implemented reduced food intake for a short period
(3 weeks), whereas it is known that longer restriction regimens (several months to years) are
needed to extend lifespan1. It would be informative to know whether longer dietary-restriction
regimens can still suppress tumours, or if tumours recur after a while. Could responsive tumours
become resistant to the beneficial effects of dietary restriction with time, just as they acquire
resistance to chemotherapy? This, in turn, raises the possibility that downregulation of insulinmediated signalling through reduced food intake may only initiate the anti-cancer benefits;
other pathways might need to be activated to maintain its suppressive effects on tumours.
Finally, in mammals and other species, different dietary-restriction regimens can all extend
lifespan. It would be interesting to test whether different regimens could also reduce PI3Kdependent cancer expansion, as only some regimens might be realistically applicable to humans
— for instance, feeding every other day rather than a 40% restriction every day.
As for cancer prevention and anticancer therapies, simply decreasing food intake might help
to delay the onset of cancer. Moreover, involvement of the insulin-mediated pathway indicates
that drugs that ameliorate insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes might be beneficial in preventing
cancer, even in non-diabetic patients. One could also envisage using dietary restriction as a
possible therapy in some specific cancers, and to predict which tumours would be vulnerable
to such treatment on the basis of their mutation profiles, in particular in the genes encoding
PTEN and PI3K. Limited food intake, together with a PI3K-pathway inhibitor, might have
synergistic effects on cancer regression in tumours that have mutations in PI3K and/or
PTEN genes. In addition, depriving tumours of nutrients locally by means of anti-angiogenic
drugs, which would interfere with the tumour’s blood supply, may be yet another way to apply
the beneficial effects of dietary restriction. In general, developing such additional strategies to

mimic restriction could be particularly useful, because — as we all know — restricting food
intake is notoriously difficult to implement in humans, and may even be psychologically
damaging.

Figure 1. Dietary restriction, insulin-mediated signalling, and cancer

Activation of cell-surface receptors by insulin triggers a signalling cascade in the cell that is
mediated by the enzyme PI3K and subsequently by FOXO transcription factors. Kalaany and
Sabatini5 find that dietary restriction reduces the activity of this pathway in some tumour cells,
thereby enhancing cell death and reducing tumour size. However, tumours in which this
pathway is constitutively active — owing to mutations in PI3K or in the PTEN enzyme, which
normally counteracts PI3K — are resistant to the beneficial effects of dietary restriction.
