ABSTRACT
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) is a well-known (Ser/Thr) mitotic protein kinase and
is considered as a proto-oncogene. As hyper-activation of PLK-1 is broadly associated
with poor prognosis and cancer progression, it is one of the most extensively studied
mitotic kinases. During mitosis, PLK-1 regulates various cell cycle events, such as
spindle pole maturation, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. However, studies
have demonstrated that the role of PLK-1 is not only restricted to mitosis, but
PLK-1 can also regulate other vital events beyond mitosis, including transcription,
translation, ciliogenesis, checkpoint adaptation and recovery, apoptosis, chromosomes
dynamics etc. Recent reviews have tried to define the regulatory role of PLK-1 during
mitosis progression and tumorigenesis, but its’ functional role beyond mitosis is still
largely unexplored. PLK-1 can regulate the activity of many proteins that work outside
of its conventional territory. The dysregulation of these proteins can cause diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease, tumorigenesis etc. and may also lead to drug resistance.
Thus, in this review, we discussed the versatile role of PLK-1 and tried to collect data
to validate its’ functional role in cell cycle regulation apart from mitosis.

INTRODUCTION

constitute an important phylogenetic space. All of the
PLK family members have highly conserved domains.
Specifically, the N-terminal catalytic kinase domain (KD)
and two C-terminal regulatory domains, which are wellknown as a polo-box domain (PBD), are highly conserved.
Interestingly, PLK-4 functions with only one regulatory
PBD domain, while PLK-5 does not contain any kinase
domains [5-7]. Many studies have tried to delineate the
precise and proper regulatory mechanisms of PLK-1
in mitosis, specially during the spindle pole maturation
(SPM), metaphase-anaphase transition, chromosome
segregation, cytokinesis, and spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC), because deregulation of these key events during
mitosis are responsible for the onset of tumorigenesis as
well as the poor prognosis of cancer [3, 8-12].

Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a well-known mitotic
kinase and is a widely studied member of the PLK
family [1]. The presence of PLK-1 was first reported in
Drosophila melanogaster as a mitotic regulator of the
cell cycle [2]. Since then, the functions of PLK-1 have
been extensively studied in mitosis during cell division
[3, 4]. PLK-1 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is greatly
conserved in wide range of eukaryotes. The PLK family
members are recognized by different names among all
species, including human PLK-1-5, Xenopus laevis (Plx13), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Plo1), Caenorhabditis
elegance (Plc1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cdc5).

Furthermore, it has been observed that aberrant
expression of PLK-1 also adversely regulates the activity
of tumor suppressor genes, p53 and pRB, leading to an
override of the checkpoint mechanism [3]. Additionally,
suppressed expression of p53 has been described in
more than 50% of tumors [3, 13, 14]. Various studies
have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides,
small interfering (si)RNA, phosphopeptides and small
molecules-based inhibition of PLK-1 is a promising
approach for combating deadly cancer [15-17]. Recently,
a study demonstrated that siRNA-based inhibition of
PLK-1 causes a notable reduction in the proliferation of
cancer cells but not in the proliferation of normal cells
[18]. It has been shown that PLK-1 is one of the major
players in mitosis during cell cycle progression, and its’
inhibition is a promising approach for combating deadly
cancers. Simultaneously, the functional role of PLK-1 is
not restricted to only to mitosis regulation because it also
has a functional niche beyond mitosis [19]. Outside of
its’ traditional function, PLK-1 regulates various events,
including DNA replication, transcription, translation,
chromosomes dynamics, DNA damage response (DDR),
checkpoint adaptation and recovery, neurodegenerative
diseases, apoptosis, organogenesis, so on. Studies
have confirmed that PLK-1 actively participates either
directly or indirectly in DNA replication, transcription
and translation [13, 20-27]. During DDR, cells undergo
one of three processes. Specifically (1) checkpoint
recovery, when cells are allowed adequate time to repair
DNA damage and resume the cell cycle for further
division; (2) Apoptosis, if DNA damage is irreparable, a
checkpoint mechanism activates the ataxia-telangiectasia
and rad3-related-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1/ ataxiatelangiectasia mutated-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2
(ATR-Chk1/ATM-Chk2) pathways leading to apoptosis
in a p53-dependent manner; (3) checkpoint adaptation,
whereby damaged DNA is in an irreparable condition and
the cell overrides the checkpoint mechanism due to failure
of the apoptotic pathways and resumes cell division with
damaged DNA, resulting in tumorigenesis [28]. PLK-1
actively participates in the above-mentioned processes
[29]. During the S-G2 phase transition, Aurora-A-BORA
(Aurora borealis, a co-factor of Aurora kinase A) catalyzes
the activation of primed PLK-1 (PLK-1 primed by CDK1, a cyclin-dependent kinase-1). Aurora-A activates PLK1 by phosphorylating KD at Thr-210 and enhances the
catalytic activity of PLK-1 [30]. Phosphorylated KD of
PLK-1 further phosphorylates and regulates the function
of targeted proteins, while the PBD of PLK-1 participates
in the subcellular localization of activated PLK-1 for
facilitating mitosis during the cell cycle [31-33]. PLK1 also targets a wide variety of substrates that regulate
cell cycle progression, and this is achieved either in a
CDK-1-dependent (substrates primed by CDK-1) or selfdependent manner (substrates primed by PLK-1) (Figure
1, Table 1). Both the CDK-1-dependent and self-dependent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

priming of PLK-1 substrates are extensively reviewed in
the reference [34].
The above-mentioned studies collectively suggest
the unconventional role of PLK-1 in replication,
transcription, translation, and in DDR, Which are outside
of its’ traditional role in mitosis. Moreover, PLK-1
overrides the checkpoint mechanism and causes failure
of the ATR/ATM pathways, which leads to tumorigenesis.
Therefore, in the present review, we have discuss the role
of PLK-1 and the substrates involved in the regulation
and control of DNA replication, transcription, translation,
ciliogenesis, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), checkpoint
adaptation, recovery, and apoptosis during DDR.

PLK-1: REPLICATION, TRANSCRIPTION,
AND TRANSLATION
A prerequisite for cell cycle progression is the
duplication of the genome, which occurs during the
synthesis phase (S- phase) of the cell cycle. A wellcontrolled replication process is desirable for the
faithful duplication of cellular DNA and is regulated by
various types of proteins such as the minichromosome
maintenance complex (MCM), histone acetyletransferease
binding to ORC1 (HBO1), DNA polymerase, PLK-1,
among others. The role of PLK-1 during replication has
been extensively reviewed by Kumar S. et al. (2016) [13].
In brief, PLK-1 catalyzes the initiation and termination
of DNA replication during cell cycle progression. In G1
phase, PLK-1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of HBO1 at
Ser-57 and facilitates the recruitment of MCM to the Prereplicative complex (Pre-RC) to generate the Pre-initiation
complex. The formation of the Pre-initiation complex is
a hallmark for the beginning of DNA replication. In the
S-phase, it has been demonstrated that Cdc5 (human
PLK-1 orthologue in Schizosaccharomyces pombe)
phosphorylates ORC2 instead of CDK to initiate DNA
replication. Moreover, in G2/M phase, overexpressed
Cdc5 mediates hyper-phosphorylation of ORC2, which
also terminates DNA replication and allows the cell to
enter the transcription phase. These studies collectively
provide evidence that PLK-1 acts as a key player during
initiation and termination of DNA replication.
Similar to replication, the process of transcription
is also a major event that is precisely controlled by
several types of transcriptional factors and extracellular
proteins. The transcriptional factors, including Forkhead
box M1 (FOXM1), are crucial for PLK-1-mediated
mitosis regulation. The FOXM1 transcription factor is a
widely known mitotic transcription factor that regulates
the expression level of G2/M-specific genes, such as
cyclin B, Nek2, and PLK-1, and plays a central role
in mitosis progression [35]. FOXM1 is a substrate of
PLK-1. CDK-1-mediated double phosphorylation of
FOXM1 at its’ C-terminus is required for the interaction
between PLK-1 and FOXM1. This interaction allows

PLK-1 to further phosphorylate FOXM1 and increases
FOXM1 activity during G2/M transition. Additionally,
the FOXM1-PLK-1 complex also controls the expression
of several mitotic-related genes, including PLK-1 itself.
Thus, PLK-1-dependent regulation of FOXM1 is not only
required for fine tuning PLK-1 regulation but also for
generating a positive feedback loop for the coordinated
regulation of mitosis [20, 36, 37]. Moreover, a recent
article demonstrated that PLK-1 can phosphorylate
FOXM1 and causes inhibition of its sumoylation. This
event promotes transcriptional activity of FOXM1 to
facilitate mitotic progression. This study also mentioned
that overexpression of PLK-1 may hyper-regulate
the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 to activate the
expression of FOXM1 targeted genes during the G2/M
phase. Consequently, the misexpression of G2/Mspecific genes can cause aneuploidy [27]. Recently, it
was observed that PLK-1 can regulate the transcriptional
level of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes in a RNA pol-IIIdependent manner. These RNAs are extensively required
during translation [22]. PLK-1 directly binds to and
phosphorylates transcriptional factor protein-1 (Brf-1) on
Ser-450 to trigger the expression of tRNA and 5S rRNA
during interphase. In addition, PLK-1 also phosphorylates
Brf-1 at another site (Thr-270) during mitosis. However,
the functional characterization of phosphorylated Brf-1
(Thr-270) by PLK-1 is still unknown. However, PLK-1mediated phosphorylation of Brf-1 is known to prevent
the recruitment of RNA pol-III during mitosis. This means
that although PLK-1 can enhance net tRNA and 5S rRNA
production in cells through its’ proliferation-stimulating
function, the KD of PLK-1 can also reduce the chances
of untimely transcription initiation during mitosis via
the PLK-1-Brf-1 complex. Furthermore, it has also been
documented that a PLK-1-mediated phosphorylation
site mutant of Brf-1 (mutant Brf-1, Thr-270Ala) causes
genomic instability in cells due to inappropriate RNA polIII activity, which leads to aneuploidy [22].
During the translation process, the mammalian RNA
processing protein DExH/D RNA helicase (also known
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as UAP56) acts both as an mRNA splicing factor and
an mRNA export factor. UAP56 is essentially required
for mRNA metabolism and axis specification [24, 38].
Previously, it has been demonstrated that the expression
levels of PLK-1 and UAP56 are inversely correlated
with each other during cell division progression [39].
PLK-1-dependent phosphorylation of UAP56 causes
its’ proteasomal degradation and results in mitotic delay
as well as sister chromatid cohesin defects, leading to
aneuploidy both in vitro and in vivo [25]. Collectively,
these studies concluded that the overexpression of PLK1 might reduce the level of UAP56 and interfere with
mRNA splicing. Furthermore, PLK-1 was also reported
to phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4B (eIF4B) in response to arsenic tetroxide treatment
in HeLa cells. eIF4B is required for the formation of
the pre-initiation complex to initiate translation [21].
Although the study showed that PLK-1 phosphorylates
eIF4B, no further detailed mechanism was delineated
[21]. It will require additional biochemical studies to
clarify the role of PLK-1 in the regulation of translation.
In brief, PLK-1 is essentially required for regulating
the initiation and termination process of replication by
modulating the activity of transcriptional and translational
machineries. The dysregulation of PLK-1 may affect the
regulatory functions of PLK-1-interacting proteins and
their localization during replication, transcription, and
translation.

PLK-1 IN NEURODEGENERATIVE
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD)
AD is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disease
that is characterized by neuronal cell loss, neuronal
inflammation, and a decline in memory and recognition
[40]. A mutation in amyloid precursor protein (APP) can
be held responsible for the cleavage of APP through a
series of secretase enzymes. Overexpressed γ-secretase
activity generates an isoform of a 42aa-long β-amyloid

peptide that is deposited outside of neuron bodies and
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) [41]. NFT is an aggregate
of hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins and β-amyloids
that then binds to microtubules of neurons, resulting in
neuronal cell death (Figure 2) [40]. Two major proteins,
dynactin and dynein, play indispensable roles in the
microtubule dynamics of neurons and in synapse formation
during brain development. p150glued is an intermediate
component of dynactin and dynein and facilitates the
movement of microtubules toward their respective polls
during chromosome segregation [42, 43]. PLK-1 has
been shown to be localized in susceptible hippocampal
and cortical neurons of AD patients [40] and p150glued has
been reported to be a substrate of PLK-1 in AD. A study
demonstrated that in hippocampal tissues of AD patients,
overexpressed PLK-1 phosphorylates p150glued at Ser-179
and induces β-amyloids-mediated neuronal cell death [44].
Moreover, RNAi-mediated knockdown of PLK-1 reduced
the β-amyloids deposition in neural cells and inhibited the
β-amyloids-mediated neural cell death [45]. This study, for
the first time, demonstrated that PLK-1 may be a crucial
target for AD therapy, and further studies are required to

explore its’ role in AD.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF PLK-1 IN THE
CILIATION CYCLE DURING VERTEBRATE
ORGANOGENESIS
Proper embryonic development of any animal is
a crucial process that is facilitated by various signaling
mechanisms. The improper development of an animal
causes a wide range of pathological and developmental
disorders. During development, cilia are vital structures
of stromal and epithelial cells and are involved in the
transduction of microtubule-based extracellular signaling.
The assembly and disassembly of primary cilia follows a
controlled dynamic process throughout the cell cycle. The
assembly of cilia is achieved during the G1 phase, while
disassembly occurs prior to mitosis [46-49]. The improper
function of cilia causes various diseases, including
renal cysts, hypertension, diabetes, neuronal, visual,
respiratory, and other developmental disorders [50-54].
PLK-1 mediates the disassembly of primary cilia in a noncanonical Wnt5a-Casien kinase1ε(CK1ε)-(Dishevelled2)

Figure 1: A substrate priming model for PLK-1-targeted substrates during cell cycle - The substrate priming mechanism
of PLK-1-targeted substrates mediated either by CDK-1 (non-self-priming) or PLK-1 (self-priming). In non-self-priming,

CDK-1 phosphorylates the PLK-1-targeted substrate to facilitate the binding of its PBD to the phosphorylated substrate. PBD-substrate
binding is required for partial activation of PLK-1 through physical dissociation of the KD from the PBD. In self-priming, inactivated PLK1 interacts with a phosphorylated substrate and facilitates its kinase domain dissociation from the PBD. PLK-1 activation is achieved by
Aurora-A-Bora to catalyze the phosphorylation substrates. Activated PLK-1 catalyzes phosphorylation of either the same substrate bound
to the PBD (processive phosphorylation) or another substrate (binds to the PBD bound substrate, distributive phosphorylation). PLK-1 may
also facilitate both models for phosphorylating the targeted substrate at same time.

Dvl2-dependent manner through the activation of the
Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1-Aurora-A (HEFAur-A) complex [55]. During cilia disassembly, Wnt5aCK1ε phosphorylates Dvl2 at Ser-143 and Thr-224.
Phosphorylated Dvl2 is necessary for the recruitment of
PLK-1 and generates the binary complex Dvl2-PLK-1.
Formation of the Dvl2-PLK-1 complex enhances Smad3 binding to Dvl2. The Dvl2-PLK-1-Smad-3 complex
stabilizes and augments the level of HEF1 by inhibiting
the interaction between HEF1 and Smad-3/APC [56, 57].
This process is required for the establishment of the HEF1
and Aur-A interaction and activates the HEF1-Aur-A
complex to facilitate disassembly (Figure 3). Moreover,
a mutant of CK-1ε-mediated phosphorylation of Dvl2
demonstrated an increase in the Smad-3-HEF1 interaction
by blocking PLK-1 recruitment to Dvl2. This leads to
the formation of the Smad-3-HEF1-anaphase promoting
complex (APC), which causes the degradation of HEF1. This study suggested that the Aur-A-HEF1 complex
might participate in the activation of PLK-1 and generate
a positive feedback loop to regulate the assembly and
disassembly of cilia during the cell cycle [55]. Despite the
role of PLK-1 in ciliogenesis, a recent study demonstrated
that PLK-1 can act as a negative regulator of Wnt/βcatenin signaling [58]. In prostate cancer, siRNA-mediated
depletion of PLK-1 increases the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic level of β-catenin in an Axin2-dependent manner.
PLK-1 phosphorylates Axin2 at Ser-311 and enhances the
interaction of GSK3β and β-catenin, leading to cytosolic
degradation of β-catenin in an ubiquitin E3 ligase APCdependent manner [58].

condensation in anaphase and are incompatible with cell
survival [60, 61]. In mammals, PLK-1 binds with the
PLK-1-interacting checkpoint “helicase” (PICH) and
targets PLK-1 on the chromosome arm to maintain the
architecture of the chromosome arm during prometaphase.
It has been demonstrated that siRNA-mediated PICH
depletion leads to the premature release of cohesin
proteins (sister-chromatids holding protein in prophase and
metaphase) due to the loss of PLK-1 on the chromosome
arm, which results in aberrant chromatid segregation [62].
This aberrant chromatid segregation can be prevented by
utilizing a Topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα) inhibitor. This
study proposed that PICH-PLK-1 maintains and controls
chromatid segregation in a Topo IIα-dependent manner
and might play an essential role in genome duplication
and segregation during chromosome dynamics.

Topoisomerase IIα (Topo IIα)
Topo IIα is a DNA gyrase enzyme that plays
an essential role in DNA replication, transcription
chromosome condensation, and chromatid separation
through its’ decatenation activity (decatenation, separating
the linkage of two circular DNA strands like a chain before
the initiation of replication) [63-65]. Decatenation activity
is catalyzed by the Brg/Brahma-associated factors (BAF)
complex subunits BRG1 and BAF250A during mitosis. A
mutation in the ATPase BRG1 protein has been reported
in childhood neuroblastoma and Burkitt lymphomas
[66]. Recently, a study reported that the BAF complex
can regulate the decatenation activity of newly replicated
sister chromatids for ordered segregation during mitosis
[67]. Moreover, the expression of point mutated BRG1 has
been reported in human tumors. Specifically, a mutated
BRG1 has been found to form an anaphase bridge (sister
chromatids attached by catenated DNA strands), which
subsequently leads to a block at the G2/M transition
(represents decatenation of checkpoint). Meanwhile,
BAF250A catalyzes the interaction of the BAF complex
to Topo IIα to recruit Topo IIα to DNA [67]. This study
observed that Topo IIα and DNA binding is facilitated by
the ATPase activity of BRG1. The binding between Topo
IIα and DNA prevents DNA entanglement during mitosis
through BAF complexes, suggesting that BAF acts as a
tumor suppressor protein. Another study has demonstrated
that PLK-1 phosphorylates Topo IIα at Ser-1337 and Ser1524 to control the segregation of sister chromatids by
increasing its’ catenation activity [68]. Overexpression
of mutant Topo IIα which lacks phosphorylation site for
PLK-1, causes S-phase arrest, which suggests that PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of Topo IIα is primarily
achieved during S-phase. Meanwhile, mutant Topo IIα
can also activate ATM/ATR-dependent DNA damage
checkpoint kinases. This activation might be possible
because Topo IIα activity is inhibited. This study also
demonstrated that PLK-1-mediated phosphorylation of

THE ROLE OF THE PLK-1 IN
CHROMOSOME DYNAMICS
Chromosome dynamics refers to the duplication
and faithful segregation of the genome during cell
division. Chromosome dynamics is a vital process that
is required for the equal and orderly distribution of
duplicated sister chromatids into two dividing daughter
cells. During mitosis, the condensation of chromatids is
a highly regulated event that leads to the segregation of
sister chromatids towards their respective poles [19]. The
duplication of the genome occurs in S-phase, while the
segregation of duplicated sister chromatids is achieved in
anaphase. Both the duplication and segregation of sister
chromatids are critical and tightly regulated processes
to ensure genetic integrity and the equal distribution of
replicated genomes into daughter cells [59].
In anaphase, Cdc5 directly phosphorylates
and activates 3 regulatory subunits of condensin (an
evolutionarily conserved multi-subunit of ATPase),
namely, Brn1, Ycg1, and Ycs4. The phosphorylated
condensin subunits then initiate the supercoiling activity
of DNA. Moreover, phosphorylation mutants of condensin
have been shown to cause aberrant chromosome

Topo IIα rescued the defects induced by the depletion of
Topo IIα during sister chromatid segregation. This study
also showed that phosphorylation by PLK-1 is essential
for catalyzing the decatenation activity of Topo IIα during
mitosis. Collectively, these studies provide evidence
that PLK-1-associated Topo IIα phosphorylation may
regulate sister chromatid segregation in a BRF and BRG1dependent manner.

Trf1 acts as a substrate of PLK-1. It was observed that
PLK-1 physically interacts with Trf1 to phosphorylate
it at Ser-435 after phosphorylation by CDK-1 in vivo
[70]. In validation, it has been shown that Trf1-Ser435A mutant does not induce apoptosis in short telomere
ends containing cells as well as not in long telomere end
containing cells. In contrast, diminishing levels of Trf1
still induces apoptosis in short telomere end containing
cells but not in long telomere end containing cells [70].
Surprisingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Trf1 induced
apoptosis in cells that even had short telomere ends.
PLK-1-mediated phosphorylation of Trf1 can increase
the DNA binding ability of Trf1, and this binding ability
reaches its’ peak both in-vivo and in-vitro during mitosis.
Moreover, this study recommended that PLK-1-dependent
phosphorylation of Trf1 is critical not only for cell cycle
regulation but, also for telomere end length control.

Telomeric-repeat binding factor (Trf-1)
The Trf1 protein is a component of the telomere
nucleoprotein complex that regulates cell cycle
progression and inhibits telomerase activity. During cell
division, Trf1 maintains the length of the telemetric end
of the chromosomes [69]. Recently, it was identified that

PLK-1 IN p53 AND pRB REGULATION

expression of mitosis-regulating genes, including PLK-1.
Overexpressed PLK-1 causes cancer in epithelial cells of
lower genital tract [76]. Whereas, HPV-E6 binds with p53
to make a ternary complex with E6AP (an E3 ubiquitin
ligase) leading to p53 degradation and pRB functional
impairment [77]. These studies collectively provide
evidence that HPV-E6/7 may transform the normal cells
into malignant cells by inhibiting p53 and pRB expression
in a PLK-1-dependent manner.

Both p53 and pRB are well-known tumor suppressor
genes that have been reported to be down-regulated in a
wide range of human cancers. Apoptosis is not induced
in cancer cells having downregulated expression of p53,
and pRB [3]. Overexpression of PLK-1 downregulates p53
expression both directly and indirectly [3, 71]. It has been
shown that PLK-1 can physically bind and phosphorylate
p53, which inhibits its’ transactivation and pro-apoptotic
function by obstructing the expression of p53-targeted,
apoptosis-inducing genes, such as p21 and BAX [72].
Studies have also demonstrated that PLK-1 regulates
p53 expression in a TOPORS and GTSE1-dependent
manner, which results in the inhibition of p53 functions
[73-75]. Human papilloma virus type-16’s onco-proteins
(E6 and E7) possess the ability to transform normal
cells into cancer cells [76, 77]. In human keratinocytes,
due to failure of spindle checkpoint by HPV-E6/7 leads
to polyploidy. Moreover, HPV-E6/7 can inhibit the
transcriptional expression of p53 and pRB, respectively
[77]. Induction of HPV-E7 aberrantly enhances the

TOPORS (Topoisomerase I Binding, Arginine/
Serine-Rich, E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase)
TOPORS is identified as a DNA topoisomerase I
binding protein and contains both ubiquitin and SUMO1 E3 ligase activity [78-80]. TOPORS comprises an
N-terminal RING Zinc-finger domain that is closely
related to the homology of C3HC4-RING domains of
viral proteins and is associated with viral transcription
regulation [80]. Recently, TOPORS has also been reported
to be a p53 binding protein [78]. Expression level of
TOPORS is high in human testis, but its’ expression is

Figure 3: A model illustrating the dynamic cycle of primary cilia disassembly in the presence and absence of PLK-1
a. In the presence of PLK-1, non-canonical Wnt5a triggers the CK-1ε-mediated phosphorylation of Dvl2 to recruit PLK-1, which
generates the CK-1ε-PLK-1 complex. This complex interacts with Smad-3 and stabilizes the HEF1 for interacting with Aur-A. Because
of the unavailability of Smad-3 for generating a HEF1 destruction complex (HEF1-Smad-3-APC complex), stabilized HEF1 interacts with
Aur-A to achieve the disassembly of the primary cilia just prior to mitosis. b. In the absence of PLK-1, Smad-3 is available for generating
the HEF1 destruction complex, HEF1-Smad-3-APC. HEF1 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome in APC-dependent manner.
Consequently, HEF1 is not available to interact with Aur-A to facilitate the disassembly of the primary cilia in the G0/G1 phase.

diminished or undetectable in different types of cancers,
including colon, lung, and brain [81]. The overexpression
of TOPORS is associated with cancer cell death due to
its involvement in G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis induction,
which explains why it has diminished or undetectable
expression levels in cancer cells [81, 82]. Studies have
demonstrated that TOPORS can also sumoylate and
degrade transcription factors, including p53, hairy,
Topo I, Sin3A, and NKX3.1 [79, 83-85]. Recently, in
mouse ovarian granulosa cells, it was observed that
TOPORS-mediated sumoylation of p53 (Lys-375)
causes its’ translocation into the nucleus and enhances
its’ stability. Increased stability of p53 promotes the
pro-apoptotic function of p53. However, mutated p53
(loss of sumoylation site, Lys-375R) is localized both in
the nucleus and cytoplasm, which suggests that nuclear
localization and stability of p53 requires TOPORSmediated sumoylation [86]. Therefore, TOPORS might be
regarded as a tumor suppressor protein because it has dual
activity in ubiquitination and sumoylation.

It has been observed that TOPORS can be
a substrate of the proto-oncogene PLK-1 [75].
Overexpressed PLK-1 phosphorylates TOPORS (Ser718), inhibits its’ sumoylation activity and enhances its’
ubiquitination activity. Phosphorylated TOPORS then
ubiquitinate p53 and causing its’ degradation (Figure 4a).
A phosphorylation mutant of TOPORS (Ser-718A) causes
the accumulation of p53. These results demonstrated that
PLK-1 negatively regulates p53 stability in a TOPORSdependent manner and degrades p53 by increasing the
ubiquitination activity of TOPORS, which leads to
tumorigenesis.

GTSE1 (G2 and S-phase-expressed 1)
GTSE1 was initially isolated by a screening of p53inducible genes. The expression of PLK-1 is maximum
during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is normally
localized at the microtubule network. During G2 phase,
the overexpression of p53 induces endogenous expression

inactivation of p53, which leads to checkpoint recovery.

PLK-1: DRUG RESISTANCE

of GTSE1 and delays the G2/M transition [87].
GTSE1 is a direct substrate of PLK-1. During
DNA damage, PLK-1 phosphorylates GTSE1 (Ser435) and facilitates its translocation into the nucleus.
Phosphorylated GTSE1 binds to the C-terminal domain
of p53 and facilitates the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling
of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Consequently,
p53 is degraded and leads to a failure of apoptosis [88,
89]. During DNA damage, GTSE1 may have dual role
in override of the G2/M checkpoint. Specifically, it may
either cause a delay in the G2/M transition or it may lead
to a failure of apoptosis induction. These studies imply
that PLK-1-phosphorylated TOPORS and GTSE1 can
negatively regulate the p53 pathway during the DDR
damage response (Figure 4b) [73, 75]. The role of GTSE1
is extensively discussed below in the checkpoint recovery
section under the DDR.

Drug resistance to molecular and chemotherapeutictargeted therapies is one of the major issues during current
era of cancer research and is an obstacle for complete
eradication of cancer [90]. Drug resistance may arise
either prior to chemotherapy (Primary resistance) or as
a result of chemotherapeutic treatment (Secondary or
Acquired resistance) [91]. Moreover, a cancer cell can
develop drug resistance by different type of molecular
alterations, including drug transport and metabolism,
drug inactivation, mutation, amplification of drug
targets and genetic rewiring (which can cause impaired
apoptosis) [90, 91]. Development of cancer is a result
of aberrant cell cycle progression, which is generally
governed by two major sets of genes, i.e. proto-oncogene
and tumor suppressor genes. The genetic alteration or
mutation (either upregulation of proto-oncogenes or
downregulation of tumor suppressor genes) in these genes
can transform normal cells into cancer cells. Studies

delay cell cycle progression to provide adequate time to repair the damage in a Chk-1- or Chk-2-dependent manner,
respectively. The ATR-Chk-2 complex inhibits PLK-1 and CDC25 to block the G2/M transition. Moreover, ATR-Chk-2 catalyzes

p53 phosphorylation to inhibit CDK-1, which facilitates the G1/S transition. Simultaneously, ATM-Chk-1 triggers p53 to activate its’
downstream targets p21 and 14-3-3. p21 and 14-3-3 both inhibit the CDK-1-cyclin B1 binary complex, which is required for the G2/M
transition and, arrests cells in the G2/M phase for short periods of time. Inhibition of the G2/M transition provides time for damage repair
and recovery from DNA damage.

have demonstrated that PLK-1 is overexpressed in more
than 50% type of cancers. siRNA-mediated depletion of
PLK-1 inhibits the tumor growth, both in vivo and in vitro
[13, 14]. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that
overexpressed level of PLK-1 is not only associated with
tumor progression but it may also lead to drug resistance.
In pancreatic cancer, PLK-1 acts as a mediator for
inducing gemcitabine resistance (replication poison) [92].
Gemcitabine treatment halts DNA synthesis and arrest cell
cycle in G1/S phase [93]. On the other hand, PLK-1 is
responsible for proper DNA synthesis by phosphorylating
ORC2 (Origin recognition complex2) and HBO1 (histone
acetyltransferase binding to ORC1 protein). Hence,
elevated levels of PLK-1 can cause gemcitabine resistance
in pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft tumor by restoring
the blocked DNA synthesis. Furthermore, PLK-1-mediated
phosphorylation of Hbo1 increases cFos (a component
of AP-1 transcription factor) expression, resulting in
elevated expression level of multidrug resistance 1
(MDR1) protein (MDR1 is an ABC type transporter
which can efflux the drugs from cell into extracellular
space). Hence, depletion of MDR1 or cFos enhances the
sensitivity and efficacy of gemcitabine to gemcitabineresistance pancreatic cancer cells [9, 92]. Another study
reported that small molecule (BI2536)-mediated inhibition
of PLK-1 potentiates the anticancer activity of metformin
(oxidative phosphorylation and mTORC1 inhibitor) in
prostate cancer cells [94]. Inhibition of PLK-1 increases
the sensitivity of metformin through stabilizing the level
of p53, resulting in initiation of p53/Redd1-dependent
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [94]. Metformin has
been shown to induce glycolysis in diabetic patients to
reduce blood glucose level and enhances insulin sensitivity
[95]. BI2536 (PLK-1 inhibitor)-treatment can inhibit the
metformin-induced glycolysis and glutamine anaplerosis
(glutamine-dependent cancer cell survival). These studies
suggested that inhibition of PLK-1 improves metformin
anticancer activity. Study also reported the involvement
of PLK-1 in transition of androgen-dependent prostate
cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC;
an androgen-independent prostate cancer) by causing
glutamine anaplerosis. Another study documented that
inhibition of PLK-1 can sensitize the CRPC to androgen
signaling inhibitors and can increase the efficacy of
androgen signaling inhibitors by blocking androgen
signaling, in vivo and in vitro [96]. From these evidences
it appears that PLK-1 plays a major role in inducing drug
resistant in different type of cancers. Hence, strategies
of inhibiting PLK-1 may be utilized for sensitizing the
resistant cancer cells to targeted drug therapies.

In the presence of damaged DNA, when DNA breaks
or replication spoilage occurs in the genetic material,
the checkpoint machinery is activated to delay cell
cycle progression and allow adequate time to repair
the damage to the DNA to maintain genomic integrity
[97]. The checkpoint machinery is highly conserved
throughout eukaryotes, and any mutation and/or genetic
defects that occur in the cells may cause them to become
highly susceptible to transformation, which can lead to
cancer [98]. During normal mitosis progression, CDK-1
and cyclin B play a crucial role during G2/M transition.
CDK-1 interacts and binds to Cyclin B to make a binary
complex, the CDK-1-Cyclin B complex. The CDK-1Cyclin B complex is found in an inactivated form during
the G2 phase owing to the negative phosphorylation of
CDK-1 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15. Inhibitory phosphorylation
of CDK-1 is catalyzed by WEE1 and MYT1. WEE1
is a Ser/Thr nuclear kinase that regulates the entry of
the cell cycle into mitosis while MYT1 is a cell cycle
regulated tyrosine kinase which inhibits the activation
of CDK-1. Nevertheless, during the course of G2/M
transition, activated PLK-1 also phosphorylate and
stimulates the dephosphorylation activity of CDC25A to
activate CDK-1-Cyclin B complex to ensure an orderly
G2/M transition [3, 99]. Meanwhile, PLK-1 can also
phosphorylate WEE1 (Ser-53) and MYT1 (Ser-426) and
inhibit their regulatory function by activating the CDK1-Cyclin B complex. Conversely, when an extended cell
cycle arrest occurs during the DDR, overexpressed PLK1 may activate CDC25A and facilitate the activation of
the CDK-1-Cyclin B complex [100-103]. The activated
CDK-1-Cyclin B complex overrides the G2/M checkpoint
and causes premature mitotic entry, which results in
tumorigenesis [28, 40]. In DDR, the overexpression of
PLK-1 inhibits the function of p53, but it a well-known
protein that maintains genomic integrity and activates the
repair machinery in the can activate CDK-1 and CDC25A
to promote the G2/M transition. As a consequence, the cell
fails to undergo apoptosis or delay cell cycle progression
to repair the damaged DNA [11, 28, 104].
DNA damage is mainly of two types: singlestrand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs).
Among these, DSBs are more dangerous to the integrity
and survival of the cells. During DDR, the checkpoint
machinery activates two main pathways, ATR-Chk-1
pathway and the ATM-Chk-2, to repair the different types
of DNA damages. The ATR-Chk-1 pathway is involved
in ultraviolet (UV)-radiation-mediated DNA damage
repair while both, ATR-Chk-1 and ATM-Chk-2 pathways,
are required to repair DSBs and delay replication forks.
During DDR, ATM recruits Chk-2 at the damaged site and
phosphorylates it so that it can activate p53. Meanwhile
ATR phosphorylates Chk-1 to interact with claspin so
that it can activate p53. Activated p53 can in turn activate
p21 (endogenous inhibitor of CDK-1 inhibitor) to inhibit
CDK-1 during the G1/S transition, which delays cell cycle

progression. During the G2/M transition, ATM-Chk-2
phosphorylates and inhibits CDC25A (Ser-123) to block
the G2/M transition because CDK-1 is not activated.
Activated p53 can also lead to degradation of CDC25A
in a Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase (SCFβTrcp)dependent manner to inhibit the G2/M transition (Figure
5). These studies collectively suggested that both, ATRChk-1 and ATM-Chk-2, the pathways could block the
catalytic activity of CDC25A and CDK-1 to delay mitosis
progression through p53 [105-108].
When cells are arrest in the G2 phase during DDR,
the cells can follow one of three possible routes. First is
checkpoint recovery, in which the cells allow additional
time for activating DNA damage repair pathways and
repairs the damaged DNA before commencement of
segregation process. The second option is apoptosis, in
which the cells activate apoptosis-inducing pathways
to induce cell death, if DNA damage is irreparable. The
third choice is a potentially deadly decision known as
checkpoint adaptation, in which stressed cells progresses
to divide with damaged DNA and may result in malignant
transformation. Surprisingly, PLK-1 has been found to be
associated with all three processes [109-111].

feedback loop is triggered by ATM-Chk-2 regulation
through the phosphorylation of 53BP1 and Chk-2. This
means that PLK-1 inactivates G2/M checkpoint signaling
to control the duration of the checkpoint.
To regulate the checkpoint recovery process,
silencing of p53 is a prerequisite. Ideally, p53 should be
functionally active to sustain G2/M arrest following DNA
damage. A question that arises is how p53 is inactivated
during G2/M checkpoint recovery. To answer this
question, Liu et al. identified a novel substrate of PLK-1,
the GTSE1 protein, which negatively regulates the level
of p53 during checkpoint recovery. GTSE1 is primarily
expressed during the G2 and S-phase and is localized
in the cytoplasm. During checkpoint recovery, PLK-1mediated phosphorylation of GTSE1 (Ser-435) is required
for checkpoint recovery and its’ nuclear translocation
[19, 73]. In the nucleus, GTSE1 binds to p53 and
triggers the shuttling of the GTSE1-p53 complex to the
cytoplasm. The shuttling of p53 to the cytoplasm causes
its’ degradation or inactivation during DDR. However, the
molecular mechanism of GTSE1-dependent degradation
of p53 during the process of checkpoint recovery is largely
unknown. GTSE1-mediated degradation of p53 leads to
the activation of CDK-1-cyclin B complex, which releases
the G2/M-arrested cell cycle to promote mitotic entry.
In addition, cells with PLK-1 phosphorylation deficient
mutant of GTSE1 (Ser-435-GTSE1-Ala) displayed
reduced nuclear accumulation of GTSE1, signifying that
PLK-1-mediated phosphorylation of GTSE1 may play a
significant role in G2/M checkpoint recovery through the
elimination of p53 (Figure 6a) [73].

PLK-1: checkpoint recovery
Multicellular organisms prefer a better and less
mutagenic strategy to avoid the harmful consequences
of DNA damage. Mammalian cells can delay cell cycle
progression to allow adequate time for repairing the
damaged DNA prior to resuming cell division. This
phenomenon is commonly known as checkpoint recovery.
If DNA damage occurs in the G2 phase, activation of
p53 by the ATM-Chk-2/ATR-Chk-1 pathway delays
the replication process and provides adequate time for
repairing damaged DNA [110]. The events regulated by
the above-mentioned pathways for DNA repair along
with p53 have been discussed in a previous section. To
elucidate the involvement of various proteins involved in
the ATM-Chk-2 pathway, a combination of bioinformatics
and biochemical approaches are a prerequisite. Recently,
a study identified various PLK-1 substrates, including
53BP1, which participates in G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint silencing [111]. CDK-1-dependent priming of
53BP1 is required to generate a docking site for PLK-1.
PLK-1 phosphorylates 53BP1 at this docking site. During
ionization radiation (IR)-mediated cell cycle arrest, the
53BP1 protein is required to release checkpoint arrest.
PLK-1 interacts with the 53BP1 protein to inactivate
the DNA damage checkpoint and release cells from IRmediated arrest. Moreover, PLK-1 can also phosphorylate
and inactivate the 53BP1-binding protein Chk-2. This was
further confirmed when a mutant 53BP1 protein was not
able to interact with PLK-1 and prevent the release of cells
from cell cycle arrest or restart IR-mediated cell cycle
arrest [111]. Taken together, the PLK-1-mediated negative

PLK-1: in apoptosis
Apoptosis is an indispensable suicidal process for
organogenesis, cell proliferation, and maintaining tissue
homeostasis in all multicellular organisms. Moreover,
apoptosis is also required for the removal of damaged
and aberrant cells. The ordered regulation of apoptosis is
critically required for maintaining the balance between
cell survival and cell death to prevent various diseases,
such as cancer [112, 113]. p53 is a major key player
which is required for apoptosis induction. During DDR,
checkpoint machinery activates and phosphorylates
p53, which leads to apoptosis. Overexpression of PLK1 negatively regulates p53 activity in a TOPORS and
GTSE-1-dependent manner. Moreover, studies have
demonstrated that small molecule, such as BI2536, and
phosphopeptides, and siRNA-mediated inhibition of PLK1 may trigger both p53-dependent and p53-independent
apoptotic pathways to inhibit tumor progression [1517]. It was observed that the antisense phosphorothioate
oligodeoxynucleotide for PLK-1 inhibits p53 expression in
colon cancer, both at the transcriptional and translational
levels, to induce apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner
[114]. Studies have collectively proposed that inhibition

of PLK-1 may activate apoptosis through the induction of
p53 and caspase cascade activation.
p73 is a member of the p53 transcription family that
is required for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. p73
may positively regulate the apoptotic function of p53regulated genes. PLK-1 catalyzes the phosphorylation
(Thr-27) and inactivation of p73 to inhibit p73-dependent
activation of apoptotic proteins, including 14-3-3σ,
p21CIP/WAF1 and Bax. It was found that siRNA-mediated
knockdown of endogenous PLK-1 in p53-/- cells causes
activation of p73 and PARP to arrest cells in sub-G1 phase
[115, 116]. Furthermore, an extended down-regulation of
PLK-1 expression enhances the level of p53, Bax, and
p21CIP/WAF1 and localizes p21CIP/WAF1 to the cytoplasm and
nucleus, which results in G2/M arrest through inhibition
of CDK-1. A reduction in PLK-1 expression may also

enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to anti-cancer agents
such as cisplatin [117]. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
PLK-1 results in induction of apoptosis through caspase-3
activation and fragmentation of the nuclei in PLK-1overexpressing cancerous cells.

PLK-1: checkpoint adaptation
Checkpoint adaptation is a lethal process for
the survival of multicellular organism. Multicellular
organisms can maintain the integrity of their genome by
activating checkpoint machinery to delay phase-transition
and allow time to repair damage. In interphase, cells
with DNA damage have activated ATR/ATM pathways,
which provide adequate time to repair damaged DNA.

Figure 6: The role of PLK-1 in checkpoint adaptation and recovery - a. During prolonged cell cycle arrest, PLK-1 is

upregulated in cells that are stressed for a long period of time. Up-regulated PLK-1 inhibits the damage repair mechanism and releases
the cells from G2/M arrest with damaged DNA. PLK-1 inhibits/degrades the various proteins that are associated either with the damage
repair mechanism or with G2/M arrest, including Chk-2, p53, MYT1, WEE1, and claspin. PLK-1 also phosphorylates CDC25 to activate
its’ phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated CDC25 activates the CDK-1-cyclin B1 complex to release the cell cycle from G2/M arrest with
damaged DNA. b. In the HR repair pathway, PLK-1 phosphorylates RAD51 to activate BRCA1/2 for activating the repair pathways in a
CK-II-dependent manner. Phosphorylated RAD51 interacts with NBS, and the RAD51-NBS complex is recruited to the damage site to
repair the damage. Moreover, PLK-1 and CK-II-dependent phosphorylation blocks the G1/S transition and provides time for damage repair.

This process enhances the chance that the cell will survive
from the fatal changes that occurred during cell division
and relaxes checkpoint stress to move the cells into the
next phase of the cell cycle [28, 99]. However, in budding
yeast, stressed cells (with damaged DNA) are permitted
to override the G2/M checkpoint barrier, which allows
stressed cells to enter in cell division without repairing
damaged DNA. This phenomenon is widely designated
as “adaptation”. The phenomenon of adaptation may
be useful for unicellular organisms to enhance their
chance of survival in the presence of damaged DNA
[118]. The DNA damage-mediated G2/M checkpoint
adaptation was first time verified in a haploid strain of S.
cerevisiae. Haploid yeast have a non-essential extra copy
of chromosome VII that contains a cleavage site for the
activity of homothallic switching endonuclease (HO) in
the MAT locus. The product of Rad52 activates repairing
mechanism in response to HO-mediated damage in MAT
locus, while Rad52 mutant haploid yeast is unable to
activate repair machinery for restoring the HO-induced
damages. When Rad52 mutant haploid yeast is arrested
in G2/M phase for approximately 10 h, cells can override
the G2/M checkpoint barrier in response to extended arrest
and re-enter the cell cycle for further division with HOmediated DSBs [119]. Moreover, this study observed that
Cdc5 (human PLK-1 homolog) regulates the checkpoint
adaptation in yeast. Sandell et al. (1993) also isolated
two adaptation-defective mutants (Bad1 and CKB2)
from Rad52 mutagenized colonies of yeast that were
permanently paused during G2/M phase. The first mutant,
Bad1 (break adaptation-defective), was allelic to CDC5
and hence was referred to as cdc5-ad. It was permanently
halted during G2/M phase in response to irreparable DNA
damage. The second mutant, CKB2, was also permanently
arrested at the G2/M phase but was affected at the CKB2
locus (encoding a non-essential subunit of casein kinaseII). cdc5-ad appears as a large-bud shaped structure with
irreparable DSBs on chromosome VII due to a mutation
in Rad52. However surprisingly, it was observed that the
mutant cdc5-ad-mediated G2/M arrest was completely
released by knockdown of the Rad-9 gene [119, 120].
Recently, it was demonstrated that overexpression of
Cdc5 leads to an override of the G2/M checkpoint
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

barrier, which is triggered by DSBs [121]. Moreover,
overexpression of Cdc5 inhibits Mec1/ATR activity and
also regulates various proteins downstream of Mec1/ATR
such as transducer kinase Rad53/Chk-2, Ddc2/ATRIP,
and checkpoint-mediator Rad-9 (Table 2). Additionally,
up-regulated expression of Cdc5 slows the DSB repair
mechanism by phosphorylating Rad-9, which leads to its’
inhibition. In summary, these findings proposed that Cdc5
may act as a central player to release G2/M checkpoint
arrest in the presence of damaged DNA by inhibiting Rad9 [121].
Haploid yeast cells demonstrate that unicellular
organisms can divide with damaged DNA, which
increases its’ chances for survival. However, while
checkpoint adaptation is beneficial for single-celled
eukaryotes, its functional role in multicellular eukaryotes
remains unclear. However, a recent study demonstrated
that human osteosarcoma cells can override IR-induced
G2/M checkpoint in a Chk-1-dependent manner and
can enter mitosis with an increased expression level of
γ-H2AX foci (a marker representing irreparable DSBs
in cells) [122]. Moreover, it has been observed that the
G2/M checkpoint override process is regulated by PLK-1
in the presence of DSBs. The G2/M checkpoint override
process may be delayed either by PLK-1 inhibition or by
Chk-1 overexpression [122]. Therefore, these findings
collectively demonstrate that PLK-1 can directly regulate
G2/M checkpoint override in DNA damage-containing
human cells and provides evidences of checkpoint
arrest override for further cell divisions in multicellular
eukaryotes.
Conversely, PLK-1 also plays a pivotal role in DNA
damage repair during S and G2 phase through homologous
recombination (HR) [123-125]. Nevertheless, the
regulatory mechanism of the HR-mediated repair pathway
is not fully understood. HR is an active process for
repairing damaged DNA during S and G2 phases. In the
HR repair pathway, many proteins are involved, including
Rad-51 (a highly conserved protein from yeast to humans).
Rad-51 is a recombinase which actively participates in

double phosphorylation-mediated activation of Rad-51
results in the binding of Rad-51 to the Nijmegen breakage
syndrome gene product (NBS). NBS halts the cell cycle
in S-phase if DNA errors are present, and can activate the
BRCA1/BRCA2 (DNA damage repair proteins) pathway
to trigger repair process [123]. Moreover, the Rad-51-NBS
complex can facilitate the mobilization and recruitment of
Rad-51 to the DNA damage site. Thus, Rad-51 protects
cells from genotoxic stress by inducing cellular resistance
(Figure 6b). For the first time, these findings have
deciphered the role of PLK-1 in the HR-mediated DNA
repair mechanism [125].
Thus, the active association of PLK-1 with
regulation of checkpoint adaptation evidently proposes
that PLK-1 may override the checkpoints in prolonged
arrested-cells by activating CDK-1 and CDC25A in
response to DNA damage.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
PROSPECTIVES
Based upon the discussed studies, it is clear
that PLK-1 function beyond its’ conventional role in
mitosis. Current studies have implicated PLK-1 in the
regulation of various events other than mitosis, including
ciliogenesis, telomeric-end length, and genomic stability
maintenance, and the regulation of p53. Moreover,
misexpression of PLK-1 has been shown to be responsible
for triggering fatal diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease
and tumorigenesis. Taking note of the versatile functional
role of PLK-1 in chromosomal segregation, mitosis
progression, and organogenesis, its’ participatory role
must be studied in other processes, such as neurogenesis,
axis patterning, germ layer specification, non-homologous
recombination, base and nucleotide excision repair, early
birth defects and other neurodegenerative diseases. A
detailed analysis of its’ functional role may provide
understanding of the neurodegenerative diseases as well
as events leading to tumorigenesis. PLK-1 might provide
a novel therapeutic target for resolving incurable diseases,
such as Alzheimer’s, cancer.
