BACKGROUND. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and overlap myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) are clonal hematopoietic disorders that share similar clinical features and molecular abnormalities, such as the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) valine to phenylalanine mutation at codon 617 (V617F) and the tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) mutation. There are limited therapeutic
options available for these diseases, and single agents have only modest efficacy. In this phase 2 study, the authors combined multiple active agents (thalidomide, arsenic trioxide, dexamethasone, and ascorbic acid [TADA]) to treat patients with these disorders.
METHODS. This multicenter trial was conducted from January 2005 to July 2007. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy
of TADA therapy. Patients received the combination for one 12-week cycle followed by maintenance thalidomide for an additional 3
months. Response was assessed using International Working Group criteria. RESULTS. Among 28 enrolled patients, the median age
was 66.5 years; 15 patients had MDS/MPN-unclassifiable, 8 patients had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia type 1, and 5 patients had
PMF. Approximately 60% of the patients had normal cytogenetics. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 5 of 14 tested patients,
and TET2 mutations were detected in 2 of 8 tested patients. Almost half of the patients had splenomegaly. With a median on-study
follow-up of 5.7 months, 21 patients (75%) completed the entire 12-week course of therapy, and 6 patients (29%) responded to TADA.
With a median extended follow-up of 24.1 months for 15 evaluable patients, the median progression-free survival was 14.4 months,
and the median overall survival was 21.4 months. CONCLUSIONS. The TADA regimen yielded clinical responses in patients with PMF
and MDS/MPN. To the authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first trial targeting this patient population. The results indicated
C 2011
that it is reasonable to incorporate multiple novel agents in the treatment of these rare diseases. Cancer 2012;118:3968-76. V

INTRODUCTION
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and overlap myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) are
clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cell origin associated with a variable clinical course. On the basis of the 2008 World
Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, MDS/MPN encompasses chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-1 and CMML-2; atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, breakpoint cluster region—v-abl
Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR/ABL1)-negative (atypical chronic myeloid leukemia
[aCML]); juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); and MDS/MPN-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-u), which includes
refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T) as a provisional entity.1 These overlap syndromes
have pathobiologic and clinical evidence of both MDS and MPN, characterized by bone marrow hypercellularity, various
myeloid lineage dysplastic and proliferative features, ineffective hematopoiesis, and frequent association with
hepatosplenomegaly.
PMF is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that often presents with upfront bone marrow fibrosis, dysplastic megakaryocytes, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and elevated leukocyte and platelet counts. Patients with PMF and overlap MDS/
MPN frequently develop progressive cytopenias and may evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. The development of

cytopenia, particularly anemia, is recognized as an adverse
prognostic feature in several prognostic scoring systems of
PMF (Lille, Mayo, Dynamic International Prognostic
Scoring System [DIPSS], and DIPSS-Plus classifications)
and CMML (M. D. Anderson classification).2-5 Multiple
new molecular abnormalities that play an important role
in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders have been identified within the past decade, including the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) valine to
phenylalanine mutation at codon 617 (V617F) mutation,
which is identified in 40% to 65% patients with of PMF
and in 26% to 60% of patients with MDS/MPN.6-10 The
tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) mutation is the
second most prevalent molecular abnormality, seen in
17% of PMF cases and 22%-58% of MDS/MPN.9,11-13
Additional molecular abnormalities known to be associated with MPN and MDS/MPN include myeloproliferative virus oncogene (MPL), additional sex combs like 1
(ASXL1), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/
IDH2), Cas-Br-M (murine) ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence (CBL), enhancer of zeste homolog 2
(EZH2), lymphocyte-specific adapter protein Lnk (LNK),
and IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1).9,13-19
Despite advances in understanding the underlying
genetic alterations in PMF and MDS/MPN, patients with
these diseases continue to face limited treatment options,
and no current clinical trials specifically target patients
with overlap MDS/MPN. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only potential curative modality, yet most
patients are not suitable candidates. Alternatives are used
either to treat symptoms or to attempt to treat the disease,
largely by cross-applying therapeutic principles from
MDS therapies: response rates, however, usually are
<20% to 25% and are of short duration.20-39 Thalidomide and its successor lenalidomide are antiangiogenesis
agents with cytokine-modulating activity that have been
used in combination with steroids in PMF patients and
produce response rates from 40% to 50%.23,24 Arsenic trioxide (ATO), which works through apoptotic and prodifferentiating mechanisms, inhibits the production of
vascular endothelial growth factor40,41 and has been used
as a single agent and in combination with gemtuzumab
ozogamicin in patients with MDS, producing response
rates from 20% to 30%.38
For the current study, we investigated the efficacy of
4-agent combination therapy with thalidomide, ATO,
dexamethasone, and ascorbic acid (AA) (TADA) in
patients with PMF and overlap MDS/MPN. This combination was chosen to target mechanisms of disease development for both MDS and MPN, because it is believed
Cancer

that patients with overlap MDS/MPN have disease characteristics of both disorders. AA depletes intracellular glutathione, thereby enhancing the activity of ATO.42-44
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Setting

Patients aged 18 years who had a diagnosis of MDS/
MPN or PMF, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 to 2, and no previous thalidomide
or ATO therapy were enrolled from January 2005 to July
2007. Before patients were enrolled, all diagnoses of
MDS/MPN (including MDS/MPD-u and CMML-1
and CMML-2) and PMF were confirmed by bone marrow analysis at 1 of the 3 participating institutions (Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals in Cleveland, or
University of Massachusetts) based on 2001 WHO pathologic classification.45 Negative BCR/ABL testing was
required for study enrollment in patients with a diagnosis
of MPN. On the basis of the 2002 M. D. Andersen prognostic scoring system for CMML, our study patients with
CMML (n ¼ 8) were distributed in the following risk categories: low risk, 5 patients; intermediate-1 risk, 2
patients; and intermediate-2 risk, 1 patient.5 In addition,
the prognostic grouping of PMF patients (n ¼ 5) was as
follows: based on the Lille classification, there were 2 lowrisk patients, 2 intermediate-risk patients, and 1 high-risk
patient; based on the Mayo classification, there were 2
low-risk patients, 1 intermediate-risk patient, and 2 highrisk patients; and, based on the DIPSS classification, there
was 1 low-risk patient, 2 intermediate-1-risk patients, and
2 intermediate-2-risk patients.4 Patients had to have a life
expectancy of at least 3 months, a platelet count
>10,000/mm3, and normal organ function.
All patients who participated in this study provided
written informed consent. In addition, the majority of
patients treated at Cleveland Clinic provided consent for
blood and bone marrow aspirate draw for correlative molecular analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as National Clinical Trial NCT00274820.
Study Design

This was a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 2
study and was approved by the institutional review of
boards at the study centers where patients were enrolled.
Enrollment occurred from January, 2005 through July,
2007. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate
response to the TADA combination, as defined below.
Secondary endpoints included safety and disease
transformation.

Figure 1. The thalidomide (Thal), arsenic trioxide (ATO), dexamethasone (Dex), and ascorbic acid (AA) regimen (TADA) is
illustrated.

Patients received oral thalidomide 50 mg daily for
2 weeks, then 100 mg daily, ATO based on the phase 2
European Union MDS regimen31 (0.25 mg/kg intravenously on days 1-5 of week 1 then twice weekly during
weeks 2-12), oral dexamethasone 4 mg daily for 5 days
every 4 weeks, and oral AA 1000 mg 2 to 3 hours
before each ATO infusion over a 12-week cycle. (Fig.
1) Thalidomide maintenance was continued for an
additional 3 months in responding patients as tolerated.
Patients received no growth factors during the study.
Study protocol required bone marrow evaluation and
spleen size assessment at baseline and after week 12 to
assess for treatment response. To monitor for ATO cardiac toxicity, a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained
at baseline and weekly thereafter to assess QTc interval.
The serum potassium level was kept 4.0 mEq/dL, and
the magnesium level was kept at >1.8 mg/dL with electrolyte supplementation as needed at the time of each
electrocardiogram screening. Laboratory evaluations and
study visits occurred weekly for the first 4 weeks then
every 4 weeks thereafter for each cycle. Adverse events
were assessed using National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria version 3.0. If grade 2 or 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred, then the next dose
of the drug was delayed for up to 4 weeks until symptom improvement. Adverse events that persisted for >4
weeks resulted in patient withdrawal from study, as did
disease progression. Patients were followed for at least 4
3970

weeks after discontinuation of the study drugs or study
completion.

Statistics and Efficacy Assessment

Because the TADA regimen had never been tested before
this study, interim toxicity assessment was performed after
enrollment of the first 6 patients with the intention to discontinue the study if 2 or more patients experienced grade
2 nonhematologic toxicity. Patients who received any
amount of study drug were included in the efficacy analysis. Survival and follow-up were calculated from the time
of study enrollment and were complete for all patients
through the completion of maintenance thalidomide and
through May, 2011 for 15 patients. The overall response
rate (ORR) was defined as achieving complete remission
(CR), partial remission (PR), and/or clinical improvement based on 2006 International Working Group
(IWG) criteria for PMF for all study participants; in addition, CR, PR, and/or hematologic improvement (HI)
were defined based on 2006 IWG response criteria for
MDS in patients with overlap MDS/MPN, because there
are no specific response criteria to address this diagnostic
entity.46,47 Disease progression also was assessed based on
2006 criteria for PMF in all study participants and based
on 2006 IWG response criteria for MDS in patients with
overlap MDS/MPN. Baseline characteristics are presented
as medians with ranges, and the Kaplan-Meier method

was used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

Twenty-eight patients were enrolled on the study, and 21
of those patients (75%) completed the full 12-week cycle
of therapy. The remaining patients (n ¼ 7) did not complete therapy for the following reasons: patient choice and
withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 3; 11%), nonhematologic
adverse events (n ¼ 2; 7%), thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 1;
4%) and no response (n ¼ 1; 4%). Baseline characteristics
of all patients are presented in Table 1. The median age
was 66.5 years (range, 49-82 years). Fifteen patients
(54%) had a diagnosis of MDS/MPN-u, 8 patients (29%)
had a diagnosis of CMML-1, and 5 patients (18%) had a
diagnosis of PMF. Almost half (46%) presented with either palpable or radiographically evident splenomegaly.
Fifteen patients (54%) had received previous therapy for
their disease; most (n ¼ 9; 60%) had received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, 2 (13%) had received azacitidine,
and 1 (7%) had received an investigational therapy. Other
therapies included prednisone (13%), anagrelide (13%),
and hydroxyurea (7%). The results of cytogenetic analysis
were available for 25 patients (89%). A normal karyotype
was detected in 13 patients (57%) with MDS/MPN and
in 3 patients (60%) with PMF. Complex cytogenetics
were observed in 2 patients (7%), both of whom had
MDS/MPN. There were no patients with isolated deletion 5q, deletion 20q, or deletion 7 chromosomal abnormalities. Five patients were positive for the JAK2V617F
mutation of 14 patients who were tested (36%). TET2
mutational status was assessed later in 8 patients with
MDS/MPN patients who had peripheral blood samples
available, 2 of whom were positive (25%). Neither of
these 2 patients had concomitant JAK2V617F mutations.
Therapy was initiated either for significant cytopenias
(61%) or for disease-related symptoms (39%).
Adverse Events and Patient-Reported
Symptoms

The interim toxicity analysis based on the first 6 enrolled
patients indicated that the combination regimen was safe
for study continuation. Adverse events in most patients
were mild (grade 1) to moderate (grade 2) (Table 2).
Seven patients (25%) experienced grade 3 hematologic
toxicities, including thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 3; 11%),
neutropenia (n ¼ 3; 11%), and leukocytosis (n ¼ 1; 4%).
Fatigue was the most common nonhematologic toxicity
and was observed in 82% of patients; only 8 patients

(29%) experienced grade 3 symptoms. Additional common nonhematologic grade 3/4 adverse events included
dyspnea (18%) and infections (14%). Approximately
two-thirds of the patients developed neuropathy,
although most of these episodes were only mild to moderate in severity, and all resolved. Similarly, approximately
60% of study patients experienced grade 1/2 lower
extremity swelling, which was managed successfully with
diuretics. Episodes of grade 3/4 fluid overload, including
cardiac tamponade and pleural effusions, developed in 1
patient and 2 patients, respectively. Two of the study
patients had grade 1/2 QTc prolongation; however, in
both patients, these electrocardiographic abnormalities
were clinically insignificant. No thrombotic episodes were
observed.

The median follow-up on the study was 5.7 months
(range, 3.3-9.0 months). According to IWG myelofibrosis
criteria, 6 patients (21%) responded to TADA therapy: 1
patient achieved PR (4%), and the remaining patients
(18%) had clinical improvement. Responses were
observed only among patients who completed the full 12week cycle of therapy (Table 3). The patient who achieved
PR had CMML-1 and also had evidence of a bone marrow response, with interval improvement of bone marrow
fibrosis from 4þ at baseline to 2þ at 12 weeks of therapy.
Regression of splenomegaly was observed in 2 patients
with overlap MDS/MPN; no spleen size reduction was
observed in any of the patients with PMF. One of 5
patients with PMF (20%) responded to therapy with
improvement of anemia. When modified IWG-MDS criteria were applied to patients with MDS/MPN, 2
achieved HI-erythroid responses, and 1 achieved a platelet
response (ORR, 20%). (Table 3) All 5 patients who had
the JAK2V617F mutation continued to have stable disease throughout the study period. One of the 2 patients
with a TET2 mutation achieved HI, and the other had

Extended Follow-Up Results

Extended follow-up data were available for 15 patents.
The median extended follow-up was 24.1 months (range,
5.2-75.8 months) for all evaluable patients, the median
PFS was 14.4 months (n ¼ 14), and the median OS was
21.4 months (n ¼ 15). Disease progression with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia was observed in 2
patients, including 1 with CMML-1 and 1 with MDS/
MPN-u. Both of these patients presented with myeloid
sarcoma, the first at 6 months of follow-up and the second
at 20 months of follow-up. Only 2 of 15 patients completed the full 6-month course of therapy with the 12week cycle of TADA followed by maintenance thalidomide. One of these patients, who remained alive at the
time of this report, had PMF with the JAK2V617F mutation and continued with stable disease at 52 months of
follow-up. The second patient who completed therapy
had CMML-1 and achieved a PR with TADA. He died of
suicide at 23 months of follow-up, at which point he was
still in remission. At the time this report was in preparation, 4 of 15 evaluable patients remained alive. In addition

Two of those patients had CMML-1 and had stable disease on TADA. One of them carried a TET2 mutation
and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation at 5
months of follow-up, and the second patient continued to
be transfusion-independent despite receiving no further
therapy after the completion of TADA. The fourth
patient, who underwent previous renal transplantation,
had MDS/MPN-u and did not respond to TADA
therapy.
DISCUSSION
PMF and overlap MDS/MPN remain considerable therapeutic challenges, because current treatment options are
only modestly successful without durable responses.
There are no drugs approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration specifically for MPNs, whereas the hypomethyating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) include
CMML on their label based on limited overlap patients
enrolled on pivotal trials. Thus, these patients represent
an unmet therapeutic medical need, and only retrospective, subgroup data support treatment approaches.

The drugs included in the TADA combination,
both independently and in limited combinations, have
demonstrated activity in both MPN and MDS. When
used as monotherapies, higher drug doses usually are
required to produce a clinical effect, even in previously
untreated or lower risk patients.32,35,36,48,49 Unfortunately, higher doses often cause intolerable medication
side effects, requiring discontinuation of effective therapies.23,48 Therefore, combining several effective agents at
lower doses has become a common approach to overcome
dose-limiting toxicities, particularly when those drugs
have nonoverlapping mechanisms of action.
This study demonstrated that the TADA regimen is
safe and tolerable enough that 75% of largely previously
treated patients could complete an intensive 12-week
therapeutic course. The regimen also was moderately
effective and was comparable to recently reported, longterm follow-up data on 50 patients with PMF from the
Mayo Clinic27 in which IWG myelofibrosis response criteria were applied retrospectively to assess the response to
thalidomide-prednisone alone or in combination with
either cyclophosphamide or etanercept. The reported
grade 3/4 hematologic and neurologic toxicities were
comparable to those observed in our study. In another
study, ATO in combination with low-dose thalidomide
resulted in clinical responses in 25% of 28 patients with
lower risk and higher risk MDS and CMML.37 Overall,
the nonhematologic adverse events, again, were comparable to TADA, with fatigue, fluid retention, and dyspnea
observed in approximately 50% of patients followed by
infections (29%) and neuropathy (21%). In contrast to
TADA therapy, hematologic toxicities, such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, were twice as common. Thalidomide produces favorable responses selectively among
patients with erythroid linage MDS.34
The steroid component of TADA may be responsible for the lower rates of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in our study. In 1 report, when prednisone was
combined with thalidomide, several patients with baseline
thrombocytopenia experienced platelet count recovery in
addition to a hemoglobin response.22 The addition of
dexamethasone to ATO and thalidomide in our study did
not seem to adversely affect the toxicity profile of the
TADA regimen and, thus, could be considered in combinations as tolerated to improve hematologic responses.
More novel combinations with lenalidomide and prednisone demonstrated responses in approximately 33% of
patients with PMF.25 However, this effect was compromised by significant myelosuppression, with rates of grade
3/4 neutropenia and anemia of 58% and 42%, respec3974

tively. Another study that used single-agent lenalidomide
for PMF reported grade 3/4 neutropenia in approximately
33% of enrolled patients.24 Comparing these results with
the rates of hematologic toxicity observed using the
TADA regimen, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of
any grade were observed in only 14% and 11% of
patients, respectively. Only 1 patient in our study had to
discontinue the therapy because of hematologic toxicity,
which was an episode of thrombocytopenia. Nonhematologic adverse effects were tolerable, and only 2 patients
required study withdrawal. Fatigue and fluid retention
were the most common side effects, although they were
mild to moderate in most patients.
Similar to our observation of responses observed
preferentially in patients who received a longer treatment
course, other studies have reported the achievement of
greater hematologic responses in patients who received at
least 3 months of continuous therapy.34,50 Therefore, to
achieve maximal effects and possibly durable responses to
therapy, it is essential to find an optimal regimen with
acceptable toxicity profile.
No major clinical differences were observed between
responders and nonresponders in our TADA study. More
than half of the TADA participants had received therapies
for their diseases before enrollment on this study. The
treatment results did not differ significantly between
untreated and previously treated individuals, emphasizing
the benefit of combination therapy at any stage of disease.
With the current availability of newer agents, such as
hypomethylators, immunomodulatory derivatives, and
JAK2 inhibitors, further opportunities will emerge for
new combination therapies, some of which already have
demonstrated promising clinical efficacy.28,30,38 One
next, obvious step would be to substitute lenalidomide or
pomolidomide for thalidomide in the current study
design.
In conclusion, TADA appears to be relatively well
tolerated and yields clinical responses in patients with
PMF and MDS/MPD. The identification of novel predictive biomarkers, such as cytokine profiles and 5hydroxymethylcytosine levels, may help identify patients
who are more likely to respond to this regimen. It is possible to design a tolerable combination regimen and to
assess responses specifically for patients with overlap
MDS/MPN, an orphan disease group in whom therapeutic options are limited.
