BACKGROUND: Evaluation of response to treatment is a key aspect in cancer therapy. Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are used in most oncology trials, but those criteria evaluate only unidimensional tumor measurements and disregard the extent of necrosis, which is the target of all effective
locoregional therapies. Therefore, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines
recommended that assessment of tumor response should incorporate the reduction in viable tumor burden. The current report provides an assessment of the agreement/concordance between both RECIST and
the EASL guidelines for the evaluation of response to therapy. METHODS: The authors evaluated a cohort
of 55 patients within prospective studies, including 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and 31 patients who
underwent percutaneous ablation (percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI]/radiofrequency [RF]). Triphasic
helical computed tomography scans were performed at baseline, at 1 month, and at 3 months after procedure, and 2 independent radiologists evaluated tumor response. RESULTS: Evaluating response according
to RECIST criteria, no patients achieved a complete response (CR), 21.8% of patients achieved a partial
response (PR) (none in the PEI/RF group), 47.3% of patients had stable disease (SD), and 30.9% of patients
had progressive disease (PD). When response was evaluated according to the EASL guidelines, 54.5% of
patients achieved a CR, 27.3% of patients achieved a PR, 3.6% of patients had SD, and 14.5% had PD. The j
coefficient was 0.193 (95% confidence interval, 0.0893-0.2967; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: RECIST missed
all CRs and underestimated the extent of partial tumor response because of tissue necrosis, wrongly
assessing the therapeutic efficacy of locoregional therapies. This evaluation should incorporate the reduction in viable tumor burden as recognized by nonenhanced areas on dynamic imaging studies. Cancer

RECIST Criteria in HCC/Forner et al

Evaluation of response to treatment is a key aspect
in cancer therapy, because objective response may become
a surrogate marker of improved survival. Several criteria
have been developed to allow a uniform response assessment,1,2 including the World Health Organization
(WHO), which published criteria for response evaluation
that became the most commonly used by investigators
around the world.3,4 Nonetheless, in the subsequent years,
several problems in terms of interpretation of these criteria
appeared, leading to numerous modifications or clarifications and resulting in a situation in which response criteria
no longer were comparable among research organizations.
In this scenario, the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines were published by the
National Cancer Institute in 2000 with the objective of
unifying criteria of response assessment.5 These rely on
the measurement of the greatest dimension of all target
lesions, and response is categorized as a complete response
(CR) (the disappearance of all target lesions), a partial
response (PR) (a decrease 30% in the sum of the greatest
dimension of target lesions), progressive disease (PD) (an
increase 20% in the sum of the greatest dimension of
target lesions and/or the appearance of new lesions and/or
unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions),
and stable disease (SD) (not enough shrinkage nor sufficient increase to qualify as a PR or as PD, respectively).
Despite the improvement of RECIST compared
with previous criteria, it has been demonstrated that their
applicability in different neoplasms is less than optimal.6
Since the publication of the RECIST criteria 7 years ago,
several reports have been published regarding the low reliability of RECIST criteria in evaluating response in different types of tumors, such as prostate cancer,7 malignant
pleural mesothelioma,8-10 nonsmall cell lung cancer,11,12
gastrointestinal stromal tumor,13,14 soft tissue sarcoma,15
neuroendocrine tumors,16 and disseminated pediatric
malignancy.17 In addition, with the advent of new drugs,
most of which are cytostatic rather than cytotoxic, the
assessment of activity by measuring tumor shrinkage may
not be appropriate at all.18-20 Finally, RECIST criteria do
not take into account changes in tumor viability that may
be associated with tumor response. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the objective of all effective
locoregional therapies (ablation and chemoembolization)
is to obtain necrosis of the tumor, regardless of the shrinkage of the lesion. Even in if extensive tumor necrosis is
Cancer

achieved, this may not be paralleled by a reduction in the
greatest dimension of the lesion. Therefore, in 2000, a
panel of experts on HCC of the European Association for
the Study of the Liver (EASL) agreed that estimating the
reduction in viable tumor volume (recognized as nonenhanced areas using dynamic imaging techniques) should
be considered the optimal method for assessing local
response to treatment in patients with HCC.21 Therefore,
most authors reporting results of locoregional therapy for
HCC evaluate tumor response according to this recommendation.22-26
The objective of this study was to compare the concordance/agreement of tumor response evaluated by
RECIST criteria versus the EASL guidelines in a cohort of
patients received the locoregional therapies frequently
used in the setting of HCC: percutaneous ablation (by
ethanol injection or radiofrequency) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study included 2 cohorts of patients who
were selected from 2 prospective investigations assessing
TACE with drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) (24
patients) and percutaneous ablation (31 patients) performed by our group.22,27 Both studies were approved by
the ethics committee of our institution.
The DEB-TACE Cohort
This cohort included 27 consecutive, asymptomatic
patients with untreated, intermediate HCC and compensated Child-Pugh A cirrhosis without vascular invasion or
extrahepatic spread (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
[BCLC] stage B) from February 2004 to May 2005. The
patients received 2 treatments with DEB-TACE separated
by 2 months except in 1 patient, who developed persistent, complete arterial obstruction during the first procedure, precluding a second treatment, and the assessment
of response was not done in 3 patients (2 because of liver
abscess and 1 because of arterial dissection).22 The diameter of DEB ranged between 500 lm and 700 lm, and
these beads were preloaded with doxorubicin adjusted for
body surface and bilirubin (100 mg/m2 in patients with
bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL and 75 mg/m2 in patients with bilirubin 1.5-3 mg/dL; maximum dose, 150 mg; median
dose, 143 mg).

The Percutaneous Ablation Cohort
This study included 42 patients and was designed to evaluate the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for assessing
tumor response after percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEI) or radiofrequency (RF) in patients with early HCC
(BCLC stage A).27 We included in this RECIST assessment the 31 patients who had basal and post-treatment
computed tomography (CT) scans obtained with the
same scan and within the period of time recommended by
RECIST criteria.
Assessment of Response
All patients underwent a multiphasic study (nonenhanced, arterial, portal and late venous phases) performed
with a helical CT scanner (Somatom Plus 4; Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) with 120 mL of nonionic contrast
agent. Slice collimation was 5 mm in the arterial and portal phases and 8 mm collimation in the other 2 phases,
and the pitch was 1.5. Images were reconstructed at 5-mm
or 8-mm intervals. CT scans were obtained within
1 month before treatment, 1 month after percutaneous
ablation or the second DEB-TACE treatment, and
3 months after the last procedure. Tumor assessment was
made using 5-mm interval, axial reconstructed images
obtained during the arterial phase. Response was defined
according to RECIST criteria5 and the EASL recommendation using WHO criteria ad taking into account tumor
necrosis recognized by nonenhanced areas. According
these latter criteria, a CR was defined as the absence of
enhanced tumor areas, reflecting complete tissue necrosis;
a partial response (PR) was defined a decrease >50% of
enhanced areas, reflecting partial tissue necrosis; PD was
defined as an increase >25% in the size of 1 measurable
lesion(s) or the appearance of new lesions; and SD was
defined as a tumor response between PR and PD.21 The
responses were evaluated blindly by 2 experienced abdominal radiologists (C.A. and J.R.); in case of a discrepancy
in response assessment, the radiologists reviewed the
images together, and a decision was reached by consensus.
Statistical Analysis
The values for baseline patients characteristics were
expressed as the mean  standard deviation or the median
and range, as appropriate. Comparisons between groups
618

were done by using the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and the chi-square test or
the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Agreement
between both tumor response criteria was assessed by j
coefficient. A conventional P value of .05 was considered
statistically significant. Calculations were done with the
SPSS software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
In total, 55 patients were included in this study: Twentyfour patients received by DEB-TACE, and 31 patients
underwent percutaneous ablation (14 by RF and 17 by
PEI). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of these
2 cohorts. All patients were cirrhotic, and the majority of
them were secondary to hepatitis C viral infection (n ¼ 39
patients; 70.9%). The median age was 67 years (range,
41-79 years), and there was a predominance of men in
both groups (n ¼ 38 men; 69.1%). Liver function was
preserved in both groups but was significantly better in
the DEB-TACE group. This is because well preserved
liver function is required in patients who are candidates
for TACE. The median basal a-fetoprotein level was
15 ng/mL, and there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. The size and the number
of nodules were significantly larger in the DEB-TACE
group, as expected, and all patients in that group fit within
the BCLC intermediate stage. Conversely, most patients
in the PEI/RF group presented with a solitary foci, and
the nodule size did not exceed 50 mm.
Tumor response was evaluated 1 month after treatment in all patients and at 3 months after the procedure in
all of the 24 patients who received DEB-TACE and in 26
patients who underwent PEI/RF; this second CT scan
evaluation was not performed in 5 patients: In 3 patients,
a CR was not achieved by the percutaneous ablation, and
retreatment was conducted; 1 patient who had a CR
according to the EASL guidelines underwent liver transplantation 2 months after PEI, and the explant analysis
confirmed complete necrosis of the tumor; and, finally, in
1 patient who achieved a CR according to the EASL
guidelines, the follow-up assessment at 3 months was
based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound, whereas a CT
scan was delayed to 6 months later. At that time point, the
response was classified again as complete.

Evaluation of tumor response is summarized in Table 2. According to EASL criteria, an objective response
was achieved in 87.1%, 75%, and 81.8% of patients in the
PEI/RF group, the DEB-TACE group, and the total
cohort, respectively. Because of its curative capability, as
expected, the CR rate was significantly greater in the PEI/
RF group compared with the DEB-TACE group (74.2%
vs 29.2%, respectively; P ¼ .009). Conversely, according
to RECIST criteria, the PEI/RF group did not achieve any
Cancer

objective response, SD was obtained by in only 19 patients
(61.3%), and 12 patients (38.7%) had PD. In the DEBTACE group, no CR was achieved, a PR was achieved by
12 patients (50%), 7 patients (29.2%) had SD, and 5
patients (20.8%) had PD. Therefore, although DEBTACE is a locoregional therapy with no curative capacity,
the objective response rate was significantly greater than
that achieved with PEI/RF when RECIST criteria were
considered (0% vs 50%, respectively; P < .001).

Table 3 summarizes the comparison of tumor
response evaluation between the EASL and RECIST criteria. RECIST criteria, as discussed above, did not identify
an objective response in any patient who underwent PEI/
RF despite the curative potential of this procedure; and,
paradoxically, among the 23 CRs that were identified by
EASL criteria, RECIST classified the same responses as
SD in 17 patients and PD in 6 patients. Similarly, the 4
PRs by that were identified by EASL criteria were classified as SD in 1 patient and PD in the remaining 3
patients. Finally, RECIST classified all responses that
were categorized as PD by EASL criteria in the same category. The evident lack of a correlation between these tumor response criteria was reflected by j coefficients of
0.301 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0498-0.552;

and 0.193 (95% CI, 0.0893-0.2967; P < .001) in the
DEB-TACE group, the PEI/RF group, and both groups,
respectively.

DISCUSSION
The accurate evaluation of response to treatment is a key
aspect in cancer therapy, because an objective response
620

may become a surrogate marker of improved survival.
Therefore, the development of reliable and reproducible
criteria universally applicable to allow comparisons
between different groups is mandatory. Thus, the
National Cancer Institute developed RECIST; and, since
its publication, it has been used commonly as a tool in oncology investigations. However, RECIST evaluates only
unidimensional tumor measurements and disregards the
extent of necrosis, which is the objective of all effective
locoregional therapies widely used for HCC, including
ablation and intra-arterial procedures like chemoembolization. In light of these findings, the Barcelona-2000
EASL clinical guidelines recommended that assessment of
tumor response should be performed taking into account
the reduction in viable tumor burden as recognized by
nonenhanced areas by dynamic CT or magnetic resonance imaging studies,21 and this criterion has been used
widely by the majority of groups dealing with HCC.
To our knowledge, there are no prospective studies
specifically aimed at comparing the EASL criteria versus
RECIST in patients with HCC who received locoregional
treatments. However, several studies have established an
association between complete necrosis of the tumor and
survival. We recently evaluated the outcome predictors in
Cancer

February 1, 2009

RECIST Criteria in HCC/Forner et al

a cohort of 282 patients with early HCC who underwent
percutaneous ablation in a single center. An initial CR
was achieved by 192 patients and was maintained until
the end of follow-up by 80 patients. In that study, a multivariate analysis of the predictors of survival clearly demonstrated that initially achieving complete tumor necrosis
was associated with significantly better survival (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; P ¼ .020).25 Those results
were reproducible by an Italian study in a similar population.28 Other studies have evaluated the response with
both RECIST and EASL criteria after radioembolization
with Yttrium-90. Sato et al23 published their preliminary
data evaluating tumor response after radioembolization
with Yttrium-90 by using WHO criteria, RECIST, and
EASL criteria and reported objective tumor response rates
of 24%, 31%, and 71%, respectively. In addition, WHO
criteria and RECIST detected no CRs, whereas 10% of
patients achieved a CR according to EASL criteria. Furthermore, the same group recently analyzed tumor
responses in 76 HCC lesions that were treated by Yttrium-90 using RECIST, the WHO criteria, the size of
necrosis, and RECIST combined with necrosis. The tumor response rate was 23% according to RECIST, 26%
according to WHO criteria, 57% according to necrosis
criteria, and 59% according to the combined criteria; in
addition, response was detected earlier according to necrosis criteria compared with the use of size criteria alone. For
these reasons, those authors concluded that the use of
combined size and necrosis criteria might lead to a more
accurate assessment of response to Yttrium-90 radioembolization than size criteria alone.29
In our study, RECIST criteria missed all CRs
obtained by tumor necrosis and underestimated the extent
of partial tumor response because of tissue necrosis. This
finding was particularly relevant for patients who received
percutaneous ablation. These therapies have curative
capability, and they constitute 1 of the most commonly
used treatments in HCC, particularly in those countries
where liver transplantation is not feasible. Ablation
repeatedly has produced high CR rates (>90%) if necrosis
is taken into account.30-32 However, if RECIST were
used, then the rate of initial objective response would be
near 0%. Thus, its established efficacy would be
neglected.
Similar conclusions were reached when assessing
transarterial procedures. The objective of these treatments
Cancer

February 1, 2009

is to achieve ischemic necrosis of the tumors, which is
associated with increase in survival.26,33,34 Therefore, it
seems reasonable to evaluate response by measuring the
extent of tumor necrosis instead of the mere measurement
of size by unidimensional or bidimensional systems.
Again, RECIST criteria underestimate tumor response to
these treatments, and its use should be discouraged in this
setting.
Finally, with the advent of biologic therapies, additional concerns about the reliability of RECIST criteria
will emerge. Several promising molecules implicated in
cancer cell signaling currently are under phase 2/3 evaluation. The majority of these treatments have demonstrated cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, properties, so
that shrinkage of the tumor after treatment is not
expected, and RECIST would not detect the potential
efficacy of these promising approaches.18,19 This is true
for bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer,35 erlotinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer,36 temsirolimus in renal
cancer,37 and, more recently, sorafenib in liver cancer,
the sole systemic agent that unequivocally has improved
survival in patients with HCC.38 Because of the finding
that most of these agents act through the inhibition of
neoangiogenesis, the assessment of necrosis could evaluate a potential tumor response more accurately, and it
would prevent the rejection of a promising treatment
because of an underestimation of its real antitumor
activity.
In summary, the current analysis indicates that
RECIST has no value in the assessment of tumor response
after locoregional therapies in patients with HCC. Thus,
RECIST should not be used, and this finding prompted
us to recommend basing the evaluation of response on
measurements of the reduction in viable tumor burden as
recognized on dynamic imaging studies.39
