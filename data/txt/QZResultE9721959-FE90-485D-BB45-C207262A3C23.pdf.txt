ABSTRACT:
Upregulation of constitutively-active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs)
has been implicated in AR-driven tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate
cancer. To date, functional studies of AR-Vs have been focused mainly on their ability
to regulate gene expression independent of the full-length AR (AR-FL). Here, we
showed that AR-V7 and ARv567es, two major AR-Vs, both facilitated AR-FL nuclear
localization in the absence of androgen and mitigated the ability of the antiandrogen
enzalutamide to inhibit AR-FL nuclear trafficking. AR-V bound to the promoter of its
specific target without AR-FL, but co-occupied the promoter of canonical AR target with
AR-FL in a mutually-dependent manner. AR-V expression attenuated both androgen
and enzalutamide modulation of AR-FL activity/cell growth, and mitigated the in vivo
antitumor efficacy of enzalutamide. Furthermore, ARv567es levels were upregulated in
xenograft tumors that had acquired enzalutamide resistance. Collectively, this study
highlights a dual function of AR-Vs in mediating castration resistance. In addition to
trans-activating target genes independent of AR-FL, AR-Vs can serve as a “rheostat”
to control the degree of response of AR-FL to androgen-directed therapy via activating
AR-FL in an androgen-independent manner. The findings shed new insights into the
mechanisms of AR-V-mediated castration resistance and have significant therapeutic
implications.

cancer (CRPC), invariably occurs [1,2]. Resurgent AR
activity is an established driver of therapeutic failure
and castration-resistant progression [1,2]. A number of
ligand-dependent and –independent mechanisms  have
been proposed to underlie AR reactivation after androgendirected therapies [1,2]. For example, overexpression of
the full-length AR (AR-FL) was shown to convert prostate
cancer growth from a castration-sensitive to a castrationresistant stage [3]. In addition, CRPC tissues were
shown to exhibit persistent levels of androgens despite
androgen deprivation [1,2]. These led to the development
of the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide (MDV3100)
and the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone for
treatment of metastatic CRPC [4,5]. They heralded a new
era of prostate cancer therapy. However, many patients
presented with therapy-resistant disease, and most initial
responders developed acquired resistance within months
of therapy initiation, again accompanied by increased
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), indicating reactivated
AR signaling [4,5]. Emerging evidences indicate that
prostate tumors can adapt to these androgen-directed
therapies, including the new agents, by signaling through
constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) that lack
the functional ligand-binding domain [6-16].
AR-Vs are upregulated in most CRPCs compared
to hormone-naïve cancers [6,7,13-17]. Intriguingly,
there is a significant discrepancy between the relative
abundance of AR-V mRNAs and that of AR-V proteins
in clinical specimens. While the level of AR-V mRNAs
is low relative to that of the AR-FL, the AR-V proteins
are expressed at a level comparable to that of AR-FL in
a considerable portion of metastatic CRPC tissues [6,16].
In addition, the absolute levels of AR-Vs may not be as
important as that of AR-FL for their respective activity.
This is because AR-FL is located in the cytoplasm in the
absence of ligand and translocates to the nucleus and
activates target-gene expression upon ligand binding,
whereas constitutively-active AR-Vs localize to the
nucleus and activate target-gene expression in the absence
of ligand [13-15,18-20]. AR-V7 (aka AR3) and ARv567es are
two major AR-Vs expressed in clinical specimens [6,7,1315]. Strikingly, patients with high levels of expression
of AR-V7 or detectable expression of ARv567es have a
significantly shorter survival than other CRPC patients [6],
indicating an association between AR-V expression and a
more lethal form of prostate cancer.
Preclinical studies have pointed to an important
role of AR-Vs in mediating castration resistance. Ectopic
expression of AR-V7 or ARv567es confers castrationresistant growth of LNCaP xenograft tumors [13,15,20].
Conversely, knockdown of AR-V7 attenuates the growth
of castration-resistant 22Rv1 xenograft tumors [13].
AR-Vs have also been shown to confer resistance to
enzalutamide in preclinical studies. Knockdown of ARVs sensitizes 22Rv1 cells and NFκB p52-transfected
LNCaP cells to enzalutamide inhibition of growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[8,11]. Reducing AR-V levels with small-molecule drugs
improves enzalutamide efficacy against the growth of
22Rv1 cells and xenografts [21]. Thus, AR-V upregulation
appears to be a mechanism for prostate cancer cells to
evade androgen-directed therapies. A comprehension of
mechanisms of AR-V action is paramount for developing
effective means to suppress AR-V signaling.
Gene expression profiling showed that AR-Vs
regulate the expression of both canonical androgenresponsive genes and a distinct set of targets enriched
for cell-cycle function [7,13,15]. The ability of AR-Vs to
regulate target-gene expression has been attributed largely
to their AR-FL-independent activity [7,8,12-15,19].
However, AR-FL and AR-V7 immunohistochemistry
staining of adjacent sections of CRPC specimens showed
that AR-V is often co-expressed with AR-FL [7]. We
reason that, in addition to binding to chromatin sites
and regulating gene expression independent of AR-FL,
AR-Vs may bind to chromatin as a complex with ARFL. Combined, these two activities may account for the
expanded AR-V transcriptome. In fact, ARv567es has been
shown to coimmunoprecipitate with AR-FL and facilitate
AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence of androgen
[15]. In the present study, we dissected the interplay
between AR-Vs and AR-FL in regulating gene expression
and mediating resistance to androgen-directed therapies.

RESULTS
AR-V mitigates enzalutamide inhibition of AR-FL
nuclear localization
Both ARv567es and AR-V7 can reside constitutively
in the nucleus [14,15,18], and ARv567es has been shown
to facilitate AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence
of androgen [15]. Enzalutamide is known to attenuate
androgen-induced AR-FL nuclear localization in cells
expressing AR-FL alone [22]. To assess the effect of
AR-V7 on AR-FL subcellular localization and the
impact of AR-Vs on enzalutamide modulation of ARFL localization, we expressed AR-FL-green-fluorescentprotein (AR-FL-GFP) with or without AR-V7-turbo-redfluorescent-protein (AR-V7-TurboFP) or ARv567es-TurboFP
in the AR-null COS-7 cells. Consistent with previous
reports [14,15,18], as shown in Figure 1A, both AR-Vs
were found primarily in the nucleus, whereas AR-FL
localized predominantly in the cytoplasm in androgendeprived conditions. Enzalutamide caused ~50% reduction
of androgen-induced AR-FL nuclear localization, but had
no effect on AR-V localization or AR-FL localization in
the absence of androgen.
When co-expressed with AR-V7 or ARv567es (Figure
1B), AR-FL could localize to the nucleus in the absence
of androgen. The nuclear localization was unaffected by

enzalutamide. Strikingly, although addition of androgen
further induced AR-FL nuclear localization, enzalutamide
could not retain AR-FL in the cytoplasm when AR-V was
present. Moreover, AR-V localization was not affected by
androgen or enzalutamide even when co-expressed with
AR-FL. A similar result was obtained in the PC-3 prostate
cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Taken together,
the data suggest that AR-Vs facilitate AR-FL nuclear
localization in the absence of androgen and mitigate the
ability of enzalutamide to inhibit androgen-induced ARFL nuclear localization.

performed sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation
(Re-ChIP) analysis with an AR-V7 antibody followed
by an AR-FL antibody in 22Rv1 cells, which express
endogenous AR-V7 and are in part driven by AR-V7
[23]. We had to limit the analysis to AR-V7 because it
is the only AR-V to which a specific antibody has been
developed. As shown in Figure 2A, we detected cooccupancy of AR-V7 and AR-FL on the promoter of
the PSA gene, and the co-occupancy was unaffected
by androgen or enzalutamide treatment. In contrast, the
promoter of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C (UBE2C)
is only bound by AR-V7 (Figure 2A and 2B), and ChIP
assay showed that AR-FL knockdown (shFL) did not
significantly affect the binding (Figure 2B). This is
consistent with UBE2C as an AR-V-specific target [6,7].
We then conducted a ChIP assay on the PSA promoter in
22Rv1 cells with or without specific knockdown of AR-FL
or AR-V7 in androgen-deprived condition. As shown in
Figure 2C, AR-FL knockdown diminished AR-V7 binding
to the PSA promoter. Similarly, AR-V7 knockdown (shV7)
reduced androgen-independent AR-FL binding to the
promoter (Figure 2D). Collectively, the data indicate that,

localization may not necessarily entail a physical

whether they bind to target promoters as a complex, we

expression and diminished the degree of response of PSA
and TMPRSS2 to androgen (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure 2). Taken together, the data indicate that, in
addition to trans-activating a distinct set of genes, ARVs activate AR-FL in an androgen-independent manner to
induce the expression of their shared targets. In doing so,
AR-Vs could serve as “rheostats” to control the degree of
response of AR-FL to androgen and to androgen-directed
therapy. Interestingly, while ectopic co-expression of ARV7 or ARv567es rendered enzalutamide ineffective against
androgen-induced AR-FL nuclear localization (Figure
1B), the presence of AR-V7 did not affect the ability of
enzalutamide to inhibit androgen-dependent expression
of PSA and TMPRSS2 (Figure 3A and Supplementary
Figure 2). Collectively, these results suggest that AR-Vs
could facilitate the nuclear localization of AR-FL in the
presence of enzalutamide, but are unable to overcome the
suppression of ligand-activated AR-FL transactivation by
enzalutamide.

androgen-induced AR-FL

To determine the impact of promoter co-occupancy
on target gene expression, we measured the mRNA levels
of both canonical androgen-responsive genes (PSA and
TMPRSS2) and AR-V-specific targets (CCNA2 and
UBE2C) in 22Rv1 cells in response to AR-FL or AR-V7
knockdown (Figure 3A). While knockdown of AR-FL and
AR-V7 both reduced androgen-independent expression
of PSA and TMPRSS2, only AR-V7 knockdown
downregulated CCNA2 and UBE2C. Notably, although
AR-V7 knockdown diminished basal PSA and TMPRSS2
levels, the levels after androgen stimulation were
essentially the same in control and AR-V7-knockdown
cells. AR-V7 knockdown thus led to a higher magnitude
of androgen induction of PSA (2.7-fold vs. 1.7-fold) and
TMPRSS2 (2.6-fold vs. 1.4-fold), and enzalutamide was
very effective in blocking the induction. Conversely,
ectopic expression of AR-V7 or ARv567es in LNCaP cells
dose-dependently induced basal PSA and TMPRSS2

of the growth of 22Rv1 cells. Congruent with the mRNA
data, after AR-V7 knockdown, the cells became more
sensitive to DHT induction of growth (Figure 4A; ~2-fold
in AR-V7-knockdown cells vs. 1.3-fold in control cells).
Consequently, the knockdown cells were more responsive
to enzalutamide growth inhibition than the control cells.
We next inoculated AR-V7-knockdown cells or control
cells in nude mice, and characterized the response of the
ensuing tumors to enzalutamide. As shown in Figure 4B,
growth inhibition by enzalutamide was more pronounced
after AR-V7 knockdown (the tumor growth curves are
presented in Supplementary Figure 3). Collectively, the
data suggest that AR-V may contribute to enzalutamide
resistance by dampening the response of the cells to
androgen induction of growth.

lentivirus into castrated nude mice. Some tumors
resumed growth with prolonged treatment (after 7-17
weeks) (Figure 5B). We serially passaged the relapsed
Tumor #1 and #2 (Figure 5B) in castrated mice treated
with enzalutamide, and considered tumors from the
second to fourth passages as enzalutamide resistant.
RNA-seq analysis of four enzalutamide-sensitive tumors
and six enzalutamide-resistant tumors showed that none
of the tumors carried the AR F876L missense mutation
(Figure 5C), which was identified in enzalutamideresistant LNCaP cells and shown to confer agonist
activity to enzalutamide [24-26]. Instead, the transcripts
of ARv567es and AR-V7 (trending toward significance)
were upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant tumors,
while the levels of AR-V4 or AR-FL transcript did not
differ (Figure 6A-D). The upregulation of AR-V was also
reflected at the protein level (Figure 6E). Interestingly,
all the enzalutamide-resistant tumors that showed higher
AR-V protein expression also express increased levels
of glucocorticoid receptor (Supplementary Figure 4), the
upregulation of which has been shown to be a mechanism
of acquired resistance to enzalutamide [27]. The data
indicate that these tumors may use multiple mechanisms
to evade enzalutamide treatment.

DISCUSSION

FL to androgen by activating AR-FL to induce target
expression in an androgen-independent manner. This is
further supported by the improved sensitivity of the cells
to androgen induction of cell growth and enzalutamide
inhibition of cell growth after AR-V7 knockdown. These
collective findings suggest that, in addition to AR-FLindependent constitutive transactivation, AR-Vs may serve
as “rheostats” to control the degree of response of AR-FL
to androgen and to androgen-directed therapy.
In the present study, we also showed that
enzalutamide becomes more potent in thwarting
the growth of 22Rv1 xenograft tumors after AR-V7
knockdown, indicating that targeting both AR-Vs and
AR-FL is needed to achieve complete AR blockade. While
corroborating the in vitro observations from Li et al. [8]
and Nadiminty et al. [11], the data contrast the finding
from Watson et al. that ectopic expression of AR-V7 in
AR-FL-overexpressing LNCaP xenograft tumors does
not affect the growth inhibitory efficacy of enzalutamide
[20]. A plausible explanation for the discrepancy is that, in
the context of AR overexpression, the growth of LNCaP
tumors may be driven mainly by the AR-FL signaling,
making enzalutamide highly effective irrespective of
AR-V expression. Nonetheless, we showed that, when the
ectopically-expressed AR-FL is lost in these tumors, they
can become resistant to enzalutamide. The resistance is

To date, the ability of AR-Vs to contribute to
castration resistance has been attributed largely to their
AR-FL-independent constitutive activity in regulating
gene expression. Here, we identified what we believe
to be a novel mechanism of AR-V action. We showed
that AR-V7 and ARv567es, two major AR-Vs, not only
facilitate AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence of
androgen but also mitigate the ability of the antiandrogen
enzalutamide to inhibit androgen-induced AR-FL nuclear
localization. In the nucleus, AR-V7 binds to the promoter
of its specific target without AR-FL, but co-occupies
the promoter of canonical androgen-responsive gene
with AR-FL in a mutually-dependent manner. The cooccupancy is not affected by androgen or enzalutamide.
Concordantly, knockdown of AR-FL and AR-V7 both
result in reduced androgen-independent expression of
canonical androgen-responsive genes, but only ARV7 knockdown downregulates AR-V-specific targets.
Notably, although basal levels of canonical androgenresponsive genes are diminished after AR-V7 knockdown,
or elevated after AR-V7 or ARv567es overexpression, the
levels after androgen stimulation are unaffected. Thus,
AR-Vs appear to repress the degree of response of AR-

accompanied by increased expression of ARv567es. Thus,
these tumors may also evade enzalutamide treatment
through shifting towards AR-V-mediated signaling.
The significance of our finding that AR-Vs activate
AR-FL to induce target-gene expression in an androgenindependent manner is based on the premise that AR-Vs
and AR-FL are often co-expressed in biological contexts.
This is supported by overlapping AR-FL and AR-V7
immunohistochemistry staining of adjacent sections
of CRPC specimens [7]. This is also supported by the
finding that androgen deprivation coordinately increases
AR-FL and AR-V mRNAs by inducing the transcription
of the AR gene and thereby increasing the recruitment of
splicing factors to AR pre-mRNA to splice both AR-FL
and AR-V mRNAs [9]. AR-V expression may also be a
result of AR gene rearrangements [28,29], and genearrangement-caused AR-V production appears to occur at
the expense of AR-FL [29]. However, a clonal selection
process is required for gene-rearrangement-mediated
AR-V production to be manifested at the level of tumor
tissues. This appears to be in contrast to the rather rapid
change of AR-V levels observed in xenograft tumors
after androgen ablation or androgen replacement [15,20].
Further, different AR-Vs can be expressed in the same
tissues. Clonal expansion of cells with one type of gene
arrangement could lead to expression of one specific
AR-V but may not be able to account for the expression of
different AR-Vs. Finally, our data showing co-occupancy
of AR-V7 and AR-FL on the PSA promoter in a mutuallydependent manner and increased response of AR-FL
to androgen after AR-V7 knockdown provided further
support to the co-expression of AR-FL and AR-V in the
same cells. Thus, the ability of AR-Vs to activate AR-FL
in an androgen-independent manner could be as important
as their AR-FL-independent trans-activating activity in
mediating castration resistance.
Our finding of AR-V and AR-FL co-regulating
the expression of canonical androgen-responsive genes
in androgen-deprived condition is reminiscent of the
transcriptome data from Hu et al. that knockout of ARFL in AR-V-transfected LNCaP cells almost completely
abolishes the expression of at least a subset of canonical
androgen-responsive genes [7]. In addition to regulating
canonical androgen-responsive genes, AR-Vs have also
been shown to regulate a distinct set of targets enriched for
cell-cycle function [6,7,13]. This is further corroborated
by our ChIP data showing the promoter of UBE2C is
bound by AR-V7 but not AR-FL. Receptor dimerization
is a crucial step of AR-FL activation [30]. ARv567es has
been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with AR-FL [15].
Here, we showed that AR-V7 and AR-FL co-reside on
the promoter of their shared target. AR-V7 and ARv567es
can localize constitutively to the nucleus, and facilitate
AR-FL nuclear localization in the absence of androgen.
It is therefore possible that AR-V7 and ARv567es dimerize
with AR-FL in the cytoplasm in an androgen-independent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

manner, and the heterodimer translocates to the nucleus
and binds to regulatory elements of their shared targets
to regulate the transcription of these targets. It remains
unknown as to whether dimerization is required for AR-Vs
to regulate their specific targets. Future studies are needed
to define the dimeric nature of AR-Vs in regulating gene
expression.
In summary, our study provides further evidence to
support AR-V upregulation as a means for prostate cancer
cells to evade all androgen-directed therapies currently
accepted in the clinic. Mechanistically, we identified a
novel mechanism by which AR-Vs mediate castrationresistant progression. We showed that AR-Vs can activate
AR-FL to induce target expression in an androgenindependent manner. By doing so, AR-Vs may serve as
“rheostats” to control the degree of response of AR-FL to
androgen and to androgen-directed therapy. Since AR-Vs
are often co-expressed with AR-FL in biological contexts,
this mechanism of AR-V action may be equally important
as its AR-FL-independent activity to castration resistance.
These findings underscore a critical need to develop
effective means to target both AR-Vs and AR-FL to
achieve complete AR blockade for more effective combat
of these clinically challenging tumors. Several natural or
synthetic compounds have been shown pre-clinically to
inhibit AR-V and AR-FL actions [17,21,31-35]. Proof of
efficacy in clinical trials is keenly awaited.

METHODS
Cell Lines and Reagents
LNCaP, 22Rv1, COS-7, and PC-3 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection at
Passage 4. Cells used in this study were within 20
passages (~3 months of non-continuous culturing). All cell
lines were tested and authenticated by the method of short
tandem repeat profiling. Enzalutamide was purchased
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX), and the purity of
>99% was confirmed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
The following antibodies were used in Western blot
analysis: anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH, Millipore), anti-AR (N-terminus-directed; PG21, Millipore), and anti-AR-V7 (Precision Antibody).
Cell growth was determined by the Sulforhodamine assay.

Subcellular Localization
AR subcellular localization is detected by confocal
fluorescence microscopy. The pTurboFP-AR-V7 and
pTurboFP-ARv567es plasmids were generated by cloning the
cDNA fragments for AR-V7 and ARv567es, respectively, into
the pCMV-TurboFP635 vector. COS-7 or PC-3 cells were
transfected with indicated plasmids and cultured in phenol
1653

Oncotarget

red-free RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum. At 40 hr after transfection,
cells were pre-treated with or without 10 µM enzalutamide
for 2 hr, followed by treatment with or without 1 nM
R1881 for 3 hr. The COS-7 cells were then fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde, and the nuclei stained with 2.5
µM DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling). The PC-3 cells were then
fixed with 70% ethanol, and the nuclei stained with DAPI.
Confocal images were obtained by using a Leica TCS SP2
system with a 63X oil-immersion objective on a Z-stage,
and an average of 6 fields with ~10 cells per field was
captured for each group. Data quantitation was performed
as described [18].

When the tumor bits grew to 100~200 mm3, the mice
started to receive 10 mg/kg/day enzalutamide through
oral gavage. The tumors were harvested when they
reached ~800 mm3 and serially passaged in castrated nude
mice following the same protocol. The second to fourth
passages of tumors were considered as enzalutamideresistant. All animal procedures were approved by the
Tulane University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

Statistical Analysis
The Student’s two-tailed t test was used to determine
the mean differences between two groups. P < 0.05 is
considered significant. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

qRT-PCR
qRT-PCR was performed as described [36]. The
qPCR primer-probe sets for PSA, transmembrane protease,
serine 2 (TMPRSS2), cyclin A2 (CCNA2), and UBE2C
were from IDT. The primer sequences for AR isoforms
were as described [13].

Tumor Xenografts

REFERENCES

Xenograft studies were conducted essentially as
described [22,32]. LNCaP cells (4x106) infected with
lentivirus encoding AR-FL or 22Rv1 cells infected with
lentivirus encoding control shRNA or AR-V7 shRNA
were inoculated into castrated or intact nude mice (Charles
River), respectively. The cells were mixed with 50%
Matrigel and inoculated subcutaneously on the right dorsal
flank. Tumor volume was calculated as 0.524 x width2 x
length [39]. When the tumor size reached ~100 mm3, the
mice were randomized to daily treatment with vehicle
or 10 mg/kg/day enzalutamide through oral gavage as
described [22].
For the development of enzalutamide-resistant
tumors, two LNCaP tumors that relapsed after
enzalutamide treatment were resected, and ~20 mm3 pieces
of the tumors were transplanted into castrated nude mice.
