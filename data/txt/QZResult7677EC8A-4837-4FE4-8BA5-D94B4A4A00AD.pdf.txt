Targeted Therapy in Pediatric and
Adolescent Oncology*
Mark L. Bernstein, MD1,2

Cancers in children and adolescents are fortunately infrequent. Overall, cure rates are good, approximately 80%, although
this varies by histology and stage. Targeted therapies aim to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity by more specifically
affecting malignant cells or their supporting stroma. Cancers of early life are often of different histology than those seen
in adults. Sometimes, the same pathway is affected, even if the histology is different. Toxicities may also be different, particularly in younger children. These factors render drug development in young people challenging. This article reviews
some successes and challenges to that development, including brief discussions of imatinib, lestaurtinib, antiangiogenesis,

Targeted therapy aims to more selectively attack the cancer cell or its immediate supportive environment, sparing
normal tissues and therefore causing fewer side effects in the host as compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.
This review will briefly discuss some examples that highlight successes at incorporation of targeted therapy in pediatric
and adolescent oncology as well as other examples that highlight some of the associated challenges.
Background
In Canada, annually there are approximately 850 new cases of cancer diagnosed in patients up to the age of 15 years,1 with
another 450 cases in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The adolescent cases number among the approximately 2000 cases
diagnosed each year in Canadian youth between the ages of 15 and 29 years.2 The population of the United States is
approximately 10 that of Canada, and the number of malignant diagnoses in children, adolescents, and young adults is
similarly approximately 10 the Canadian figure. In children and adolescents, acute leukemia accounts for around 25%
of cases. It is more frequent and more commonly lymphoid in younger patients. Central nervous system tumors and lymphomas each include another 25% of patients, with the remainder comprised of neuroblastomas mainly in infants and
toddlers, Wilms tumor mainly in toddlers, bone sarcomas predominantly in adolescents, soft tissue sarcomas in both populations, and a miscellany of other diseases. Mortality declined steadily from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, with a
less steep decline more recently. This is particularly true of the solid tumors (Fig. 1).
The goals of incorporating novel targeted agents include both an increase in efficacy, especially for those diseases
that remain of poor prognosis, and a decrease both in the short-term toxicities, such as myelosuppression, infection, nausea, and vomiting, and in long-term toxicities, including neurocognitive impairment, infertility, cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality, obesity, and second cancers. Targeted therapy is based on several findings. Some changes are unique to the
malignant cells; for example, the product of the bcr/abl translocation in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph1þ) leukemias or the ews/fli1 translocation in Ewing sarcoma. Some pathways are more prominent in malignant tissues, and some
may be important in cancers across a broad age range. These include the insulin growth factor receptor and angiogenesis pathways. Some surface markers are relatively selective for the malignant cell and are therefore designated tumor-associated antigens,
although they are not specific for only tumor tissue. These cell surface markers may or may not be the same in tumors across

the age spectrum. The agents themselves can be small molecules that, for example, bind to important sites on targets,
interfering with their function; antibodies that can, for
example, block receptors or target a tumor for immune
attack; proteins; or peptides.
Examples of targeted therapy applied to this age
group are discussed here, as follows:
Imatinib Mesylate
Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the bcr/abl tyrosine kinase that is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 2% of childhood acute lymphoid leukemia
(ALL), and up to 25% of adult ALL. It was initially shown
to induce prolonged complete remissions in adults with
chronic phase CML, as well as transient responses in those
with blast crisis CML or ALL. In addition, it was very well
tolerated.3,4 A Children’s Oncology Group phase 1 study
(P9973) was opened in 2000 to investigate the role of
imatinib in Ph1þ leukemias in children. Eligibility
included age younger than 22 years at enrollment, recurrent or refractory CML, ALL or acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), adequate organ function, and no concurrent anticonvulsant therapy. Four dosage levels were studied: 260
mg/m2 (around 400 mg for an adult), 340 mg/m2 (600
mg), 440 mg/m2 (800 mg), and 570 mg/m2 (1000 mg)
each day, with all doses given continuously and a 28-day
period defined as a course of therapy. Dosage escalation

was in a standard 3 þ 3 schema. There was only 1 doselimiting toxicity, a 10% weight gain in the first cycle.
Overall, there were few adverse events, which, in addition,
were not clearly drug-related or dose-related. Efficacy
reproduced that seen in adults, with excellent survival in
those with recurrent chronic phase CML, and much less
effect in those with more advanced disease (Fig. 2).5 A
phase 2 study in those younger than 22 years with newly
diagnosed chronic phase CML then followed, with standard eligibility criteria for performance status and organ
function, and no concomitant anticonvulsants or Coumadin therapy, because of the possibility of drug interaction.
The dosage selected was 340 mg/m2/d, because it was well
tolerated in the phase 1 experience, and experience in
adults had suggested the possibility of improved response
with higher dose therapy. Fifty evaluable patients were enrolled, at a median age of 12 years (2-19). Imatinib was
generally well tolerated. Edema or weight gain was seen in
only 4% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was noted
in 15% of patients in courses 2 to 5. Other toxicities were
infrequent. The best cytogenetic response among the 46
evaluable patients was a complete response in 33 (72%),
partial response in 7 (15%), minor or minimal response
in 4 (9%), and no response in only 2 (4%) patients. The
responses were durable. With a median follow-up of
almost 4 years for patients still alive at last contact, 6

remission showed evidence of recurrence of Ph1þ cells in
subsequent cytogenetic evaluations 2 to 24 courses after
initial documentation of complete cytogenetic remission.
Nine patients died, 7 because of transplant-related mortality, 4 having been taken to transplant in complete cytogenetic remission, 3 after recurrence (Champagne et al,
submitted for publication). These results are similar to
those seen in adult patients (reviewed in Jabbour et al6).
For patients who develop cytogenetic or molecular
recurrent or progressive disease, newer, more potent bcr/abl
inhibitors have been developed, including dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib. Drugs that are effective against the least
responsive mutant clone (T315I) are also in development.6
The excellent efficacy and limited toxicity of imatinib and the development of second-line and third-line
bcr/abl inhibitors for patients with chronic phase CML
have changed the overall strategy for both adult and pediatric patients. Many adult patients are no longer treated
by high-dose therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant,
the only known curative therapy for CML. In many centers, pediatric patients are similarly offered allogeneic
stem cell transplant only if there is a well-matched donor,
preferably a sibling donor, because the outcome of such
transplants is far better than of those from less wellmatched siblings.7 Because the underlying molecular abnormality of CML is the same in adults and children, the
pharmacokinetics are similar,8 and as CML is uncommon
in children, especially younger children, Children’s Oncology Group has to date elected not to further study this
population of patients, expecting clinicians to adapt
guidelines from studies in adults as they develop.
In view of the success of imatinib in patients with
chronic phase CML and the poor outcome of patients
with Ph1þ ALL, a logical next step was to incorporate
imatinib into systemic therapy for ALL. To ensure patient
safety, this was done as exposure to increasing numbers of
days of imatinib therapy by cohort. This also proved a success, with patients receiving continuous imatinib in addition to chemotherapy showing an improved outcome
when compared with historical controls, and a trend toward improved outcome when compared with patients
having undergone stem cell transplant (Fig. 3).9 Currently, Children’s Oncology Group is studying the addition of a newer generation, more potent inhibitor,
dasatinib, to a similar chemotherapy backbone to determine whether further improvement in outcome can be
achieved (AALL0622).
The bcr/abl gene product is essential to the life of
Ph1þ leukemia cells in a more fundamental sense than

for the other targets of imatinib, ckit and platelet-derived
growth factor alpha. A Children’s Oncology Group study
yielded only 1 partial response in 59 patients with recurrent solid tumors.10 In vitro, drug levels that were inhibitory to the target protein did not cause cell death, which
required much higher drug levels, different from the similarity between the protein-inhibitory and cell death-inducing levels in Ph1þ leukemias.11 In addition, although
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in adults frequently have activating c-kit mutations and respond to
imatinib,12 the rare pediatric GIST is more likely to have
wild-type c-kit and not respond to imatinib.13
Flt3 Inhibition
Other malignant cells are less exquisitely sensitive to target
inhibition, as compared with the sensitivity of Ph1þ
CML cells to targeting by imatinib. An example is the
flt3 pathway in leukemic cells with internal tandem duplications of flt3 and an elevated allelic ratio.14 Although this
pathway can be inhibited, an industry-sponsored trial of
the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib
given sequentially after induction in patients with recurrent AML showed no benefit.15 Of interest, 46 of 79
patients tested had at least 85% plasma inhibitory activity;

39% of them achieved a complete response or a complete
response without full platelet recovery. This is in contrast
to an only 9% rate in those with plasma inhibitory concentrations below the target. In addition, in adults with
recurrent disease, as compared with those newly diagnosed, there are increased levels of circulating flt ligand,
which can interfere with inhibition, and increased levels
of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, which binds lestaurtinib.16
Children’s Oncology Group had initiated a study of lestaurtinib in a similar setting of recurrent AML
(AAML06P1), but given the results in adults, that study
has been closed after initial tolerability had been demonstrated but before the efficacy phase with a targeted
plasma inhibitory activity had been completed. Other flt3
inhibitors are available that are more specific and/or more
potent. Their exact role in recurrent and newly diagnosed
AML remains to be defined.17 This demonstrates some of
the difficulties with early selection of an agent when several are being developed and all may not survive to market, even when the pathway targeted is the same as in an
adult malignancy.
Lestaurtinib has also shown preclinical activity
against neuroblastoma, possibly in part by blocking the
trk-B pathway.18 Lestaurtinib enhanced the preclinical activity of the cytotoxic combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide without enhancing toxicity. In contrast,
lestaurtinib in combination with the antiangiogenic bevacizumab was more toxic than predicted, with half the
mice treated requiring euthanasia.19 If lestaurtinib will no
longer be developed, an alternate compound affecting the
same trkB pathway, possibly in addition to other receptor
tyrosine kinases, such as sunitinib,20 will be required.
Antiangiogenesis
A nutrient supply is essential to the growth of both primary and metastatic cancers. Tumor neovascularization
includes both angiogenesis, the sprouting of vascular tubes
from pre-existing vessels, and vasculogenesis, the formation of new vessels from endothelial progenitor cells.
Tumor cells are also capable of migrating along pre-existing blood vessels, co-opting their nutrient supply. Tumor
angiogenesis often involves the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) pathway (summarized in Miletic et
al21). Bevacizumab is a humanized anti-VEGF antibody
that may sensitize endothelial cells to cytotoxic cell death.
In addition, by encouraging pruning of the abnormal vasculature, bevacizumab and other antiangiogenic agents
may improve the delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy to
tumor cells, decreasing vasogenic edema by decreasing

Cancer

vascular permeability, decreasing interstitial pressure
within the tumor, and increasing oxygenation in the tumor tissue.21 Ewing sarcoma may be a particularly attractive target for antiangiogenic therapy. The ews/fli1
oncogene down-regulates thrombospondins, which are
angiogenic inhibitors,22 and up-regulates VEGF.23 Vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vessel mimicry are all involved
(reviewed in DuBois et al24). Preclinical combination therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy added efficacy.25 A European study randomizing the addition of bevacizumab to
chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic
Ewing sarcoma is underway, as is a study in patients with
newly diagnosed osteosarcoma at St. Jude’s Children’s
Research Hospital. Of note, 6 of 17 adult patients with
metastatic sarcoma treated with the combination of bevacizumab and doxorubicin developed at least grade 2 cardiotoxicity, despite cardioprotection with dexrazoxane begun
at a doxorubicin dosage of 300 mg/m2.26
Alveolar soft part sarcoma is a rare malignancy
affecting mainly adolescents and young adults. It is poorly
responsive to chemotherapy.27,28 It harbors a characteristic t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) translocation resulting in MET
activation, and histologically it has a prominent capillary
vascular pattern.29 Responses have been seen with both
sunitinib30 and cediranib,31 small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that exert antivascular effects. Many other
antiangiogenic compounds are being developed, including pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and cilengitide, for a
variety of pediatric malignancies (Fig. 4). The exact role
of each of these will be challenging to define.
Immunotherapy (Anti-GD2)
GD-2 is a ganglioside present on almost all neuroblastoma cells that continues to be expressed even after antiGD2 therapy is administered. It was first identified on
neuroblastoma cells and in the sera of patients in 1984.32
Antibodies, including the ch14.18 antibody, were then
developed; ch14.18 entered a clinical trial in children
with neuroblastoma and adults with melanoma in 1992.
Increased antineoplastic activity was observed with the
concomitant administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2).33
Another phase 1 study incorporating ch14.18 and IL-2
was initiated in 1990,34 and a follow-on study using the
combination after high-dose therapy and stem cell reinfusion began in 2000.35 A phase 3 study randomizing cisretinoic acid alone after transplant compared with combination immunotherapy followed by cis-retinoic acid began
in 2001. It was closed at an interim evaluation point in
2009, with the immunotherapy arm having crossed a

developed. Small molecules that will target major downstream cell-signaling pathways as well as gene regulatory mechanisms

boundary demonstrating increased efficacy (Fig. 5).36 A
study gathering further information to support a licensing
application is in progress. Recent reanalysis of a German
study nonrandomly assigning patients to ch14.18 after
high-dose therapy supports its efficacy.37 Other studies
using other antibodies or modifications of the ch14.18
antibody are in progress, and consideration is being given
to using ch14.18 in other diseases, such as osteosarcoma,
that express the GD2 antigen. The 25-year time course of
development of this therapy, which provides a real
improvement in outcome for children with advanced stage
neuroblastoma, with licensure still in progress, underlines
some of the difficulties associated with pediatric drug development. These are primarily related to the small population of children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer,
frequently of different pathologies from those seen in
adults. Drug development for such a small population is
financially unappealing. Even when similar molecular

2272

pathways are involved, drug development requires pharmaceutical industry interest based on efficacy and tolerability
in adults.

Pharmacokinetics
The most important maturation of the systems for drug
metabolism and excretion occur in the first 2 years of life.38
Toxicities are sometimes heightened in such young children.39 Occasionally, older but still prepubertal children
have increased sensitivity to particular toxicities of chemotherapy, as has been seen with pseudotumor cerebri in children treated with all-trans retinoic acid.40 Postpubertal
adolescents and young adults most commonly demonstrate similar pharmacokinetics, as seen in 2 of the drugs
discussed in this review, bevacizumab41 and imatinib.8

board approval in all institutions that may wish to use a
given protocol. In addition, changes in practice patterns
such that youth are cared for in a unit designed to serve
their needs by practitioners specialized in their care are
likely to better meet the needs of this group. Such teenage
and young adult units have been and are being further
developed in the United Kingdom, as outlined in more
detail elsewhere in this Supplement.

Summary and Conclusions
Cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults is
uncommon. Overall, cure rates are good, around 80%,
although variable by histology and stage. Diseases of relatively unfavorable histology, such as the bone sarcomas,
often affect both adolescents and young adults. Children’s
Oncology Group has joined the Clinical Trials Support
Unit, a project sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the support of a network of physicians to
participate in NCI-sponsored phase 3 cancer treatment
trials. This initiative is likely to facilitate the entry of
young adult patients onto relevant Children’s Oncology
Group studies. Similarly, studies for adults with cancers
that also affect youth occasionally allow study entry of
patients as young as 14 years. Moreover, with increasing
knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer, medications
designed for cancers of adults may affect the same pathways in childhood and adolescent cancers, speeding their
development. Increasing the proportion of children and
adolescents from whom tumor tissue is collected will facilitate the identification of these pathways. Together, these
several factors are anticipated to lead to treatments with
increased efficacy and decreased short-term and long-term
toxicity for the relatively underserved adolescent and
young adult population. To realize these benefits, however, the major challenges of administrative and regulatory hurdles need to be overcome. An example is a
simplification of the process of obtaining research ethics
