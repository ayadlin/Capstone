ABSTRACT
Granulocytic-Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) are increased in
Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients but the mechanisms of G-MDSC generation are still
unknown. There are many evidences of the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
in promoting MM cell growth, survival and drug-resistance. We here used a specific
experimental model in vitro to evaluate the ability of MSC to induce G-MDSC. We
found that although MSC derived from healthy donors (HD), MGUS and MM were
able to generate the same amount of MDSC, only MM-MSC-educated G-MDSC
exhibited suppressive ability. In addition, in comparison with MSC derived from HD,
MM-MSC produce higher amount of immune-modulatory factors that could be
involved in MDSC induction. Compared to G-MDSC obtained from co-culture models
with MSC from healthy subjects, both MGUS and MM-MSC-educated G-MDSC showed
increase of immune-modulatory factors. However, only MM-MSC educated G-MDSC 1)
up-regulated immune-suppressive factors as ARG1 and TNFα, 2) expressed higher
levels of PROK2, important in angiogenesis and inflammatory process, and 3) showed
ability to digest bone matrix.
Our data demonstrate that MM-MSC are functionally different from healthy
subjects and MGUS-MSC, supporting an evolving concept regarding the contribution
of MM-MSC to tumor development and progression.

INTRODUCTION

niches and receive multiple signals that maintain their
long survival and exert a protective effect on druginduced apoptosis, due to the secretion of soluble factors,
such as IL6 and extracellular vescicles [4–6]. Within the
microenvironment, the host immune system has a pivotal
role for the PC growth, proliferation, survival, migration
and resistance to drugs and is responsible for some clinical
manifestations of MM [4, 7, 8].
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) include
myeloid cells at different stage of maturation characterized
by the ability to suppress immune responses, including T

Monoclonal gammopathies encompasse a spectrum
of clinical variants ranging from monoclonal gammopathy
of uncertain significance (MGUS) through smoldering
Multiple Myeloma (MM), up to the most aggressive,
symptomatic MM and plasma cell leukemia [1, 2]. There
are several evidences indicating that development of MM
is due not only to uncontrolled proliferation of plasma
cells (PC) but also to change in the bone marrow (BM)
microenvironment [3]. Here PC are hosted in special

cell proliferation and cytokine production [9–11]. Several
groups highlighted the emerging role of MDSC in MM
pathogenesis and clinical behavior, and have documented
their increase in both peripheral blood (PB) and BM of
MM patients [4, 12–18].
Based on the expression of surface antigens and
studies available in mice, two main subpopulations
of MDSC can be distinguished: CD11b+ CD14–
CD15+CD33+CD66b+HLA-DR–
granulocyte-like
(G-MDSC) and CD14+CD15–HLA-DR– monocytelike (Mo-MDSC) [5, 19–21]. MDSC are able to inhibit
the immune system by multiple mechanism, mostly
through production of arginase 1 (ARG1), nitric oxidase
synthase 2 (NOS2), reactive species of oxygen (ROS),
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), transforming growth factor
β (TGF-β) and immunosuppressive cytokines, such as
IL6, IL10 and IL1β [22]. In addition, MDSC can induce
regulatory T-cells [22] and differentiate in functional
osteoclasts contributing to the formation of osteolytic
lesions in solid tumors [23–25].
BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are essential
components in the formation and function of the BM
microenvironment [26–28]. They are a heterogeneous
population of stromal adult stem cells with an important
role into the tumor microenvironment due to their
immunosuppressive ability, such as the capacity to inhibit
T cell activation and proliferation. Indeed, MSC can
interfere with the recognition of tumor cells by immune
system producing and releasing immunoregulatory factors
as TGFβ, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα), indolamine 2,  3-dioxygenase (IDO),
hemeoxygenase (HO), NOS2, ARG1–2, IL10 [29–32]. MSC
express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) that after its
engagement with PD-1 expressed on T lymphocytes lead
to the inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation with
an inefficient immune response [29, 33].
Even though we and others have demonstrated
increased levels of MDSC in PB from MM patients and
characterized their immunosuppressive role [4, 12–16],
the role of MSC in MDSC expansion and activation into
the BM microenvironment remains unexplored.
In the present study, we investigated the role of MSC
obtained from MGUS and MM patients on expansion and
activation of G-MDSC compared to MSC from healthy
donors (HD).

compared to MGUS (54.7  ±  6.3) and healthy subjects
(58.2  ±  4.6%) (p =  0.03 and p <  0.001  respectively)
(Figure 1A).
We next evaluated the immune-suppressive activity
of MDSC. For this purpose, we incubated G-MDSC
obtained from MM and HD with autologous CFSE-labeled
T cells and we found that only MM G-MDSC were able
to reduce autologous T cells proliferation (44.3 ± 2.3% vs
30.0 ± 1.5%, p = 0.009) (Figure 1B).

MM-MSC promote induction of MDSC in the
microenvironment of MM patients
We next assessed the role of tumor microenvironment
on expansion and activation of MDSC, focusing our
attention on MSC.
To explore their influence in the induction of
MDSC, PBMC from healthy donors were co-cultured
with HD-, MGUS- or MM-MSC for one week. Then, the
frequency of G-MDSC in PBMC was analyzed before
cell magnetic separation. Both HD-, MGUS- and MMMSC accumulated similar small amount of G-MDSC
(Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we analyzed immunesuppressive activity of MSC-educated G-MDSC (MSCedG-MDSC). These cells were obtained with magnetic cell
separation and the G-MDSC phenotype was confirmed
by cytofluorimetric analysis (Supplementary Figure 2).
Interestingly, we found that only MM-MSCed-G-MDSC
were able to suppress T-cells proliferation (p = 0.001),
while this suppressive activity was not recorded for
MGUS-MSCed-G-MDSC or HD-MSCed-G-MDSC
or G-MDSC control (isolated from PBMC cultured in
medium alone) (Figure 2).
Therefore, even if HD-, MGUS- and MM-MSC are
able to generate similar amount of G-MDSC cells, only
MM-MSCed-G-MDCS exhibited suppressive effect on T
cell proliferation.

Molecular regulators of MM MSC-mediated
MDSC activation
In many cancers, it has been demonstrated that
tumor-associated microenvironment produces a large
amount of immune-modulating factors involved in
reprogramming immature myeloid cells to become
immunosuppressive G-MDSC and to attract them at
the tumor sites [36]. These immunomodulatory factors
include PTGS2, TGFβ, NOS2, IL10, TNFα, IL1β, and
IL6. Therefore, we first analyzed their expression by
MM-MSC compared to HD-MSC at Time 0. A great
variability of expression was observed among the patients,
but no up-regulation of the genes above described was
observed (Figure 3A). After 48 h of co-culture with PBMC,
MM-MSC showed statistically significant up-regulation of
PTGS2 (5.8 ± 5, p = 0.018), TGFβ (27.8 ± 34, p = 0.03),
NOS2 (20  ± 25.8, p = 0.04), IL10 (19 ± 1, p = 0.017)

RESULTS
Increased frequency of G-MDSC in MM patients
The frequency of G-MDSC (CD11b+CD15+CD14–
HLADR– cells) was evaluated in the PB of HD, MGUS
and MM patients at diagnosis and relapsed using flow
cytometry. Percentage of G-MDSC was significantly
higher in PB of patients with newly diagnosed
(65.1  ±  11.9%), and relapsed (80.1  ±  10.2%) MM

and IL6 (40.7 ± 22, p = 0.02) expression compared with
HD-MSC (Figure 3B), suggesting that MM-MSC are
functionally different from HD-MSC and are able to
produce higher amount of immunomodulatory factors that
could be involved in MDSC generation.

ARG1 (111.5 ± 50.2, p = 0.001). PROK2 is a molecule
involved in angiogenesis and inflammatory process
[37, 38], while ARG1 is an enzyme with a key role in
immunosuppression. Releasing ARG1, myeloid cells
deplete L-arginine and profoundly suppress T cell immune
response [39].

Before incubation with T cells, the relative
expression levels of our set of immune modulatory factors
was also investigated in MM- and MGUS-MSCed-GMDSC compared to HD-MSCed-G-MDSC. With the
exception of TGFβ, all the other immune-modulatory
factors were found up-regulated in both MGUS- and
MM-MSCed-G-MDSC, although up-regulation of TNFα
(45.7  ±  28.8, p =  0.002) was almost exclusive of MM
MSCed-G-MDSC (Figure 4).
We also found that only MM-MSCed-G-MDSC
significantly upregulated PROK2 (6.4 ± 1.7, p = 0.03) and

Since MM patients have an enhanced bone
resorption and increased inflammatory signals into the
microenvironment, we next investigated if MM-MSCeducated G-MDSC may be involved in the digestive
process of bone. Therefore, G-MDSC control, HD-,
MGUS- and MM-MSCed-G-MDSC were plated onto
dentine disks (DDs) for 3  days. A significant digestive
activity was observed only in DDs with MM-MSCed-GMDSC (p = 0.002) (Figure 5).

peripheral blood of healthy donors, MGUS and newly diagnosed or relapsed MM patients by flow cytometry (panel A). MM G-MDSCmediated T-cells suppression was assessed in autologous co-cultures. Mean frequency of CD3+ CFSE dim cells ± SD from four independent
experiments in duplicate is shown (panel B).

DISCUSSION

factors involved in myelopoiesis and impairment of
myeloid differentiation. A large amount of molecules
released by tumor cells or tumor-surrounding cells,
including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and TGF-β,
are reported to re-program immature myeloid cells to
become immunosuppressive [5, 36, 40]. Therefore, we
investigated the direct role of MM-MSC in G-MDSC
induction. Despite HD-, MGUS- and MM-MSC generate
similar amount of G-MDSC, the ability to suppress
T-lymphocytes proliferation was found only for G-MDSC
that were generated after a co-culture with MSC derived
from patients with MM and not from MGUS or healthy
subjects. This finding is in line with observations from
Sánchez et colleagues who showed that in a murine model
oncogenesis drives MSC to increase the production of
PGE2 favoring inhibition of lymphocytes proliferation and
differentiation of myeloid precursors to highly suppressive
cells [41]. However, one of the main question regarding
MSC from MM patients stays still whether they are or
not different from healthy MSC. Our work contribute
to elucidate the different role of MM versus MGUS
and healthy MSC, confirming the abnormal immune

A well-recognized feature of MM is the intimate
relationship between PC and BM microenvironment [4].
In this context, it is emerging the role of Myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC) that are able to suppress immune
responses, thus inducing an immunosuppressive milieu
and contributing to create a permissive microenvironment
that fosters evolution of disease [4, 11–17].
There are evidences that MDSC accumulation
in PB and BM of MM patients correlates with disease
progression and/or drug resistance [5], but little is known
about the mechanisms of MDSC expansion, differentiation,
and activation in MM. In this paper, we first confirmed
that MDSC are increased in MM patients and are able to
suppress T cells proliferation. Being MSC a key stromal
cell population of the BM milieu that are able to transform
the microenvironment into an immunosuppressive one in
order to sustain PC proliferation, we have hypothesized the
possibility that MSC could contribute to generate MDSC.
In fact, accumulating evidences indicate that
tumor-associated microenvironment produces several

modulatory ability of MM-MSC. Since this difference
in G-MDSC activation has been found for isolated MM
MSC after in vitro expansion, these stromal cells have a
constitutive functional alteration in immune regulation.
When compared with their normal counterparts,
MM-MSC differ in cytokine production, show a decreased
proliferative ability with a premature senescence profile
[42] and reduced capacity to inhibit T cell proliferation
[43]. It is still an open question whether MSC have
genomic alterations which may contribute to the
pathogenesis of MM. MM-MSC exhibit a distinctive
gene expression profile compared to HD-MSC [44],
suggesting that these differences could be attributed to
the presence of genomic alterations in MM counterpart
[45, 46]. Some reports have favored the possibility of a
common haematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor
[47, 48]. Garayoa et al. tried to find whether cytogenetic
abnormalities present in PC were shared by matching
MSC from the same patient [27]. All analyzed MMMSC were cytogenetically normal for the tested genomic
alterations, thus excluding a common progenitor for MMPC and MSCs. With the present work, we suggest that
MM-MSC can be functionally different from MSC from
healthy subjects and MGUS, favoring immunosuppressive
abilities of surrounding myeloid cells.

Exploring the immune-modulatory factors expressed
by MM-MSC that are able to generate G-MDSC, we found
a statistically significant up-regulation of PTGS2, TGFβ,
NOS2, IL10 and IL6 expression, suggesting that multiple
mechanisms are involved in generation and activation of
G-MDSC. Since gene expression changes were not found
at t0, the expression of the immune modulatory factors is
influenced by interaction with PBMC in vitro, confirming
that MM-MSC have constitutive immunological functional
alterations.
Comparing MGUS- and MM-MSCed-G-MDSC
to HD-MSCed-G-MDSC, both myeloid populations
overexpressed IL-6, IL-1-β, PTGS2 and IL-10.
However, only MM-MSCed-G-MDSC up-regulated
TNFα and ARG1, providing thus evidence that MMMSC transform myeloid cells in immunosuppressive
ones. In fact, up-regulation of ARG1 is one of the
main mechanisms of MDSC-induced immunesuppression [49], while TNFα has been shown to arrest
differentiation of immature myeloid cells and increase
MDSC suppressive activity [50].
Yan et colleagues have also reported that IL-6
cooperates with G-CSF to induce tumor function of
murine neutrophils in BM by modulating signaling
pathways that favor tumor angiogenesis through

up-regulation of PROK2 [51]. Interestingly, we found the
up-regulation of PROK2 by MM-MSCed-G-MDSC that
may be linked to over-expression of IL6 by MM-MSC
during co-culture with PBMC. PROK2 is a key regulator
of inflammation-dependent tumorigenesis promoting
chemotaxis, angiogenesis [38, 52] and drug-resistance
into the tumor microenvironment [53]. Since MGUSMSCed-G-MDSC do not express PROK2, it is possible
that MDSC present in MM patients may contribute to the
“angiogenic switch” that characterizes the transition from
MGUS to MM.
The osteoblasts derived from MM-MSC exhibit a
diminished matrix mineralization potential when compared
with MSC from healthy donors [44]. Furthermore, the
clinical observation that bone lesions persist in patients
who respond to therapy supports the idea of a permanent
defect in the MM-MSC [54]. Previous studies have shown
that in response to PC, MM associated-mesenchyme
release pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines that increase
osteoclasts (OC) recruitment and OC-mediated bone loss
[55, 56]. STRO-1 is a well characterized MSC antigen
expressed by a population of immature and multipotent
MSC [57]. Noll et al. demonstrated increased amount of
STRO-1 MSC in MM patients that correlated with more
severe disease and that expressed higher levels of PC- and
OC-activating factors, including RANKL and IL6 [55].
Recently, it has been reported that neutrophils can acquire

monocytic characteristics in response to inflammatory
signals [58]. For the first time, we demonstrated that,
unlike MGUS-, MM-MSCed-G-MDSC were able to digest
bone matrix, suggesting that MM-MSC may indirectly
contribute to bone resorption by G-MDSC activation.
In conclusion, these findings strongly support an
evolving concept regarding the contribution of MM-MSC
in tumor development and progression, indicating that
cancer progression may rely on MSC both directly and
through G-MDSC-mediated immunosuppression into the
MM microenvironment, leading to the cancer immune
surveillance evasion. The acquisition by MM-MSC of the
ability to induce G-MDSC with an immunosuppressive
behavior and digestive ability might represent an
evolutionary advantage acquired during the multistep
development of cancer.
Taken together, our data give further evidence of the
key role played by MSC in MM BM microenvironment,
making it an immune-tolerant milieu through G-MDSC
induction. Therefore, the interaction of MM cells
with MSC creates an important loop: PC stimulate
the proliferation of MSC [55] and influence their gene
expression profile [59], but at the same time MSC
support MM cell growth and survival by releasing
several cytokines and growth factors, and by promoting
MDSC activation (Figure 6). Elucidation of the complex
interactions between MM cells and MSC into MM

streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine. After 3 days in culture,
non-adherent cells were removed, whereas MSCs were
selected by their adherence to the plastic-ware. The
cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. MSCs
were expanded until the third or fourth passage and then
trypsinized to be used for experiments.
Selected MSC from both patients and HD at the
third passage were also tested for MSC specific surface
antigen expression (Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore,
cells were labeled using combinations of monoclonal
antibodies: anti-CD34-ECD (clone 581), anti-CD90FITC (clone F15.42.1.5), anti-CD105-PE (clone 1G2) and
anti-CD45-PC5 (clone J.33). The appropriate isotopic
control was also included. Labeled MSC were acquired
using a Beckman Coulter FC-500 flow cytometer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and sample collection
After written informed consent approved by the
local ethical committee (Azienda ospedaliero Universitaria
Policlinico-Vittorio
Emanuele,
#
34/2013/VE),
samples were collected from MGUS (n =  30), newly
diagnosed (n = 30) and relapsedMM (n = 15) patients and
age-matched HD (n =  30) at Division of Hematology,
AOU Policlinico–OVE, University of Catania. Clinical
data of MM and MGUS patients included in this study are
shown in Table 1. Patients were free of immune-mediated
diseases and acute or chronic viral infections to exclude
any interference on immune-regulatory mechanisms. All
MGUS patients had a stable condition with at least 2 years
of follow up.

MDSC induction
Human peripheral blood mononucleated cells
(PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteer donors
after density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll. PBMC
were cultured alone or co-cultured with MSC derived
from healthy, MGUS or MM subjects as described above
(1:100  ratio). MSC were seeded to achieve confluence
by 7  days. After one week, PBMC were collected and
G-MDSCs were isolated using anti-CD66b magnetic
microbeads. The phenotype of G-MDSC was confirmed
by cytofluorimetric analysis. Their immunosuppressive
capacity was analyzed by evaluating T cell anergy
when co-cultured with autologous CFSE-labeled T cells
stimulated by PHA. Controls included a positive T cell
proliferation control (T cells plus PHA) and a negative
one (T cells only). After three days T cell proliferation was
analyzed by flow cytometry.

G-MDSC evaluation
Whole blood collected in EDTA vials (50  μL)
was stained with monoclonal antibodies (moAbs, 10 μL
for each) and respective isotypic controls [34]. The
moAbs (Beckman coulter) included: CD11b FITC (clone
bear-1), CD15 PE (clone 80H5), CD14 PC5, (clone
RMO52), HLA-DR- ECD (Clone Immu-357). Using
sequential gating strategy, G-MDSC were identified
as CD11b+CD15+CD14–HLADR–. The acquisition and
analysis was performed with a Beckman Coulter FC-500
flow cytometer (10,000 cells were analyzed).
To evaluate the suppressive ability, G-MDSC
from MM patients and HD were isolated using antiCD66  magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and
then co-cultured for three days with autologous
Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled
T lymphocytes at ratio 1:4 [35]. For cell labeling,
5 × 105 lymphocytes were incubated at 37°C for 20 min
in 1 ml PBS containing 1 µM CFSE (BD Pharmingen).
T cells were stimulated with 5 mg/mL phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) and incubated for 72 hours prior to flow cytometry.
Controls included a positive T cell proliferation control
(T cells plus PHA) and a negative one (T cells only). After
three days, T cell proliferation was measured by CFSE
dilution and analyzed using flow cytometry.

Real-time RT-PCR for gene expression of MSC
and MDSC
For gene expression studies, MSC were trypsinized
from culture flasks both at Time 0 (cells at confluence
incubated with standard medium only) and after 48 hours
from start of co-culture experiments. In addition,
MSC co-cultured with PBMC were purified using
anti-CD271  magnetic microbeads. G-MDSC control
(isolated from PBMC cultured in medium alone), MGUSand MM-MSC-educated G-MDSC were collected from
co-cultures and isolated by magnetic microbeads. After RNA
extraction and reverse transcription, we evaluated expression
of the following mRNA: ARG1 (Arginase 1), NOS2 (Nitric
Oxide Synthase 2), PTGS2 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide
Synthase 2), TNFα (Tumor necrosis factor alpha), TGFβ
(Transforming growth factor beta), IL6 (Interleukin 6),
IL10 (Interleukin 10), IL1β (Interleukin 1beta),
and PROK2 (Prokineticin 2/BV8). Their expression was
assessed by TaqMan Gene Expression (Life Technologies)
and quantified using a fluorescence-based real-time detection

were rinsed with water and stained with 1% (w/v) toluidine
blue in 0.5% sodium borate for 30 s and then washed twice
with water. The number and the area of resorption pits were
then measured by light microscopy using ImageJ software.
Results were expressed as the number of resorption pits.
Experiments were performed in triplicate.
