ABSTRACT
Glycerrhetinic acid (GA), one of the main bioactive constituents of Glycyrrhiza
uralensis Fisch, exerts anti-cancer effects on various cancer cells. We confirmed
that GA inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung
cancer A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. GA also induced expression of autophagy marker
phosphatidylethanolamine-modified microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3
(LC3-II) and punta formation of green fluorescent protein microtubule-associated
protein light-chain 3. We further proved that expression of GA-increased autophagy
marker was attributed to activation instead of suppression of autophagic flux. The
c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was activated after incubation with GA.
Pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or silencing of the JNK pathway by
siRNA of JNK or c-jun decreased GA-induced autophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress responses were also apparently stimulated by GA by triggering the inositolrequiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) pathway. The GA-induced JNK pathway activation and
autophagy were decreased by IRE1α knockdown, and inhibition of autophagy or the
JNK cascade increased GA-stimulated IRE1α expression. In addition, GA-induced cell
proliferative inhibition and apoptosis were increased by inhibition of autophagy or the
JNK pathway. Our study was the first to demonstrate that GA induces cytoprotective
autophagy in non-small cell lung cancer cells by activating the IRE1α-JNK/c-jun
pathway. The combined treatment of autophagy inhibitors markedly enhances the
anti-neoplasmic activity of GA. Such combination shows potential as a strategy for
GA or GA-contained prescriptions in cancer therapy.

primary components and bioactivity compounds of G.
uralensis Fisch in vivo, has been demonstrated to exhibit
various pharmacological anti-cancer, hepatoprotective,
and anti-inflammatory properties [7–9]. The anti-cancer
property of GA has been examined in several types of
cancer cells, including breast cancer MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells, gastric cancer BGC823 and SGC7901
cells, as well as prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The potential

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the
most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer death
worldwide [1]. The survival rate remains very poor and
the treatment cost is very high despite various methods
for NSCLC treatment, including surgical resection,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and small molecular target
therapy [2]. Except for upper treatment strategies, traditional
Chinese prescriptions are also widely used for NSCLC
treatment in clinical medicine in China because of their
efficient therapeutic effect and low cost [3, 4]. Prescriptions

mechanisms of the anti-cancer properties of GA involve
reduction of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest, as well as inhibition of cellular metastasis
[9–11]. GA also prevents tumor initiation and exhibits
remarkable anti-growth and anti-metastasis properties in
vivo without causing side effects [11–13].
Autophagy is a conserved metabolic pathway that
clears and recycles damaged proteins or organelles in a
lysosome-dependent manner for cell survival [14, 15]. The
process begins when phagophores emerge and nucleate
at the phagophore assembly site. Phagosomes elongate
to form autophagosomes via two ubiquitination-like
systems, namely, the phosphatidylethanolamine-modified
microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 (LC3-II) system
and the autophagy-related protein ATG12-ATG5-ATG16
system. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes to form
autolysosomes and degrade their cargo [16–19]. A number of
studies indicate that autophagy is stimulated under starvation
and hypoxia through various tumor cell survival mechanisms
and that inhibition of autophagy obviously decreases tumor
growth [20, 21]. In addition, after chemotherapeutic drug
treatment, the autophagy level of tumor cells increases
to enhance drug resistance and decrease the anti-cancer
effects of chemotherapeutics [22, 23]. Therefore, targeting
autophagy to enhance the therapeutic effects of anti-cancer
agents presents a novel approach for tumor therapy.
The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
is identified as the main and classical pathway for

autophagy activation. Inhibition of the Akt/mTOR cascade
apparently increases autophagy. Rapamycin, a well-known
mTOR inhibitor, is widely used as an autophagy inducer
[24–26]. The mitogen-activated protein kinase family is
also an important mediator of autophagy. Our previous
studies demonstrate that activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) by diverse compounds can induce
autophagy [27–29]. C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) further
plays a key role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressinduced autophagy. In JNK pathway-deficient in vitro and
in vivo models, ER stress-induced cell death is remarkably
enhanced in the absence of autophagy [30, 31].
In this study, we confirmed that GA induces
cytoprotective autophagy in NSCLC A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells by IRE1α-JNK/c-jun cascade activation
and that inhibition of autophagy or the JNK pathway
increases GA-induced inhibitory effects and apoptosis.

RESULTS
GA induces cell proliferative inhibition,
apoptosis, and autophagy in A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells
We initially investigated the effects of GA on A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells proliferation. As shown in Figure 1A–1B,
GA remarkably increased inhibition rates in a concentration-

dependent manner. The colony formation ability of A549
was decreased after GA treatment (Supplementary Figure
S1A). The protein expressions of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), a biomarker of apoptosis [32], and
caspase-3/7 activation were detected. GA increased cleaved
PARP expression and caspase-3/7 activation (Figure 1C–
1F and Supplementary Figure S1B). In addition, annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide dual labeling indicated
that exposure of A549 cells to GA increased apoptotic
cell percentages (Supplementary Figure S1C). Apoptotic
chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation were also
observed after GA treatment by Hoechst 33342 staining assay

(Supplementary Figure S1D). These data suggested that GA
induced apoptosis in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells.
We then determined whether or not GA could induce
autophagy in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. Western
blot assay was performed to examine the protein expression
of LC3-II, which is essential for autophagy formation and
mainly used as a protein marker of this phenomenon [33].
LC3-II protein expression in NSCLC cells increased in
a concentration- and time-dependent manner after GA
treatment compared with that in the control group (Figure
2A–2C and Supplementary Figure S2A). An immunoreactive
band corresponding to processed LC3-II was slightly

expression by Western blot analysis. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01. C. A549 cells were treated with GA (40 μM) for the indicated time. Western
blot was used to detect protein expression. D. A549 cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-LC3 plasmid with or without GA (40
μM) for 24 h. GFP-LC3 punta formation was determined using In Cell Analyzer 2000, and typical images were presented.

enhanced as early as 6 h after GA (40 μM) treatment. This
band intensified with prolonged treatment, particularly after
a 24 h treatment (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S2A).
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 plasmid was further
transfected into A549 cells to characterize GA-induced
autophagy and observed diffused localization of GFP-LC3
in the control cells. By comparison, a 24 h cell exposure to
GA (40 μM) resulted in extensive GFP-LC3 punta generation
(Figure 2D). In GFP-LC3 stable expression HeLa cells. More
GFP-LC3 punta were generated in the GA-treated group than
in the control group (Supplementary Figure S2B). These data
indicated that GA increased autophagy marker expression in
cancer cells.

Therefore, we examined whether GA induced autophagy
via JNK/c-jun cascade. As shown in Figure 5A and
Supplementary Figure S5A, treatment of the indicated
concentrations of GA for 24 h increased the expression
of phosphorylated c-jun and total c-jun in A549 cells.
However, the phosphorylated JNK was not increased
after 24 h of GA treatment. Results suggested that JNK
can be activated immediately when treated with certain
compound and decline thereafter [38]. Therefore,
phosphorylated JNK expression was investigated after
various periods of GA treatment. JNK activation was
observed after 30 min of GA exposure, and activation of
kinase disappeared after 3 h; these findings were similar
to our initial hypothesis (Figure 5B and Supplementary
Figure S5B).
The JNK/c-jun pathway inhibitor SP600125 was
used to examine whether GA induced autophagy by
JNK/c-jun activation [39]. As shown in Figure 5C and
Supplementary Figure S5C, GA-activated JNK and c-jun
were decreased after pretreatment with SP600125 (10
μM, 1 h). The autophagy marker LC3-II induced by GA
was also reversed, suggesting that GA induced autophagy
via the JNK/c-jun pathway. To confirm the significance
of JNK in GA-induced autophagy, siRNA was used for
JNK silencing. Silencing of JNK by siRNA decreased
the GA-induced LC3-II expression in both A549 and
NCI-H1299 cell lines (Figure 6A–6B and Supplementary
Figure S6A–S6B). The GA-induced GFP-LC3 punta
were also suppressed after JNK knockdown in A549 cells
(Figure 6C). In addition, c-Jun knockdown was performed
to evaluate the effects of the JNK/c-jun pathway on
GA-induced autophagy. Silencing of c-jun decreased
GA-induced autophagy in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells,
as evidenced by the reversal of GA-induced LC3-II
expression (Figure 6D–6E and Supplementary Figure
S6C–S6D). Thus, activation of the JNK/c-jun cascade was
pivotal for GA-induced autophagy in NSCLC A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells.

GA induces autophagic flux in A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells
Increase in LC3-II protein or GFP-LC3 punta
responses to the agent may increase the autophagic flux
and/or suppress autolysosome degradation [33, 34]. To
determine whether or not GA induced autophagic flux
in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells, cells were pretreated with chloroquine (CQ), which affects lysosomal
acidification to inhibit autophagy [33]. Results suggested
that GA increased the protein expression of LC3-II when
combined with CQ treatment (Figure 3A–3B), indicating
that GA induced autophagic flux. These results were
verified by transfecting cells with the mRFP-GFP-LC3
plasmid to evaluate the autophagic flux. mRFP-GFP-LC3
is used to examine induction or suppression of autophagic
flux [33]. If autophagic flux increases and autolysosome
maturation occurs normally, more red punta are observed
in the cells because of the easy-to-quench GFP and the
relatively acid-stable mRFP. Inhibition of autophagosomelysosome fusion and/or lysosomal function lead to most
punta exhibiting both red and green fluorescence; these
punta appear yellow in merged images [35]. As shown
in Figure 3C, large amounts of red-only punta were
observed in GA-treated cells transfected with mRFPGFP-LC3 plasmid, indicating that GA induced autophagic
flux. Silencing of key autophagy factors, including
ATG7, Beclin1, and ATG5, was performed to analyze
GA-induced autophagic flux. Results showed that cells
transfected with the siRNA of ATG7, Beclin1, or ATG5
exhibited lower levels of LC3-II accumulation after GA
treatment, compared with that in the random siRNA
control (Figure 4A–4B, Supplementary Figure S3A–S3B,
and Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B). GA-induced GFPLC3 punta were also reversed after genetic inhibition of
autophagy by ATG7 knockdown (Figure 4C).

ER stress-stimulated JNK/c-jun activation is
critical for GA-induced autophagy in A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells
Induction of ER stress by two classical ER
stress inducers, i.e., thapsigargin and tunicamycin,
can stimulate autophagy [30, 31]. In the current study,
GA induction of JNK/c-jun activation by ER stress
stimulation was verified. Results showed that the
expressions of the ER stress sensor IRE1α, its downstream XBP-1s, and ER stress-related protein Chop and
Bip were increased after GA treatment regardless of GA
concentrations (20 μM) (Figure 7A and Supplementary
Figure S7A). IRE1α knockdown by siRNA decreased
GA-induced autophagy, as shown by decreased GFP-LC3
punta formation and LC3-II expression (Figure 7B–7D
and Supplementary Figure S7B–S7C). In addition, the
correlation between ER stress and JNK/c-jun in A549 and

The JNK/c-jun pathway plays a pivotal effect in

NCI-H1299 cells was determined. Knockdown of the ER
stress sensor IRE1α partly inhibited the phosphorylation
of JNK and c-jun after 30 min and 24 h of GA treatment,
respectively (Figure 7C–7D and Supplementary Figure
S7B–S7C). However, inhibition of the JNK/c-jun
pathway by SP600125 or siRNA of c-jun increased GAinduced ER stress in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells (Figure

8A–8B and Supplementary Figure S8A), which may be
attributed to the inhibition of GA-induced autophagy.
Combined treatment of CQ or ATG7 knockdown also
increased GA-induced ER stress (Figure 8C–8D and
S8B), indicating that the autophagy inhibition could
increase the cellular content of misfolded and damaged
proteins, followed by ER stress stimulation [31]. The

NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells by stimulation of

or autophagy increased GA-induced ER stress.

for GA-induced autophagy, we primarily evaluated the
GA-induced inhibition rate and apoptosis by JNK/cjun pathway suppression. As expected, the GA-induced
inhibition rate and apoptosis were apparently increased
after JNK/c-jun blockage in both A549 and NCI-H1299
cell lines (Figure 9E–9H and Supplementary Figure S9G).
However, GA-induced inhibition rate and caspase-3/7
activation did not markedly change after IRE1α siRNA
(Supplementary Figure S10A–S10D), which could be
attributed to IRE1α induction not only of autophagy but
apoptosis as well [41]. The overall data suggested that the
GA-induced autophagy in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299
cells were cytoprotective.

Inhibition of autophagy and JNK increases
GA-induced proliferative inhibition and
apoptosis in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells
The effects of autophagy (prosurvival or prodeath)
in cancer therapy remain complex and inconclusive [40].
In the current study, GA-induced inhibition rate and
caspase-3/7 activation were increased in both A549 and
NCI-H1299 cell lines after suppression of autophagy
by ATG7 siRNA or pretreatment with CQ (5 μM, 1 h)
(Figure 9A–9D and Supplementary Figure S9A–S9D).
Western blot analysis also indicated that the expression
of cleaved PARP increased more extensively after
autophagy inhibition (Supplementary Figure S9E–S9F).

component in vivo [44, 45]. A number of studies show
that GA can impart protection against tumorigenesis
by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis [11–13].
However, the present study confirms that GA stimulates
apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy in NSCLC
A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. GA induced autophagy
mainly by the IRE1α-JNK/c-jun pathway activation,
and autophagy or JNK inhibition apparently increased
GA-induced cell proliferative inhibition and apoptosis.
Several agents exhibit autophagic regulatory effects
by increasing the levels of LC3-II or autophagosomes
[46, 47]. However, increases in LC3-II expression or
autophagosome accumulation may be an autophagy
inducer (i.e., increases the autophagic flux) or inhibitor
(i.e., inhibits the function of lysosome or the fusion of
autophagosome with lysosome). Decreased LC3-II or
autophagosomes may also be an autophagy inducer (i.e.,
accelerates autolysosome degradation) or inhibitor (i.e.,
inhibits the key components of autophagosome formation)
[33, 34]. Methods such as combined treatment with CQ or
use of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid must be considered

to detect this property [33]. In the present study, the
expression of LC3-II in combined GA and CQ treatment
is more apparent than in either GA or CQ alone (Figure
3A–3B). More red fluorescent punta were observed in the
GA-treated group than in the CQ-treated group (Figure
3C), indicating that GA induced autophagic flux in A549
and NCI-H1299 cells. In addition, compounds induce
or inhibit autophagy depending on the cell line studied.
For instance, paclitaxel, inhibits autophagic flux in
breast cancer cells but stimulates autophagic flux in renal
cancer cells [48, 49]. The current study suggests that GAinduced autophagy is universal, at least in NSCLC and
hepatocellular carcinoma cells [28].
The mechanism of GA-induced autophagy was
further investigated. In hepatocellular carcinoma cells,
GA induces autophagy by ERK activation [28]. In the
present study, GA also triggered ERK activation in
NSCLC cells (Supplementary Figure S11A). However,
inhibition of the ERK pathway by pre-treated with
PD98059 or ERK siRNA could not decrease GA-induced
LC3-II expression (Supplementary Figure S11B–S11C).

expression of A549 cells was evaluated by Western blot analysis. B. A549 cells were cultured with GA (40 μM) for specific periods.

without the JNK pathway inhibitor SP600125 (10 μM, 1 h). Protein expression levels were detected by Western blot analysis. *P < 0.05
and **P < 0.01.

The classical autophagy negative regulation cascade Akt/
mTOR was further examined [24, 50], and results showed
that GA could not decrease the activation of Akt/mTOR
pathway-related proteins (Supplementary Figure S12A).
Therefore, the mechanism of agent-induced autophagy
was correlated with the cell type. We also observed this
phenomenon in baicalein, one of the key flavones isolated
from Radix Scutellariae. Baicalein induces autophagy
in HepG2 cells by inhibition of the Akt/mTOR cascade
[51]. Meanwhile, ERK pathway activation is critical for
baicalein-induced autophagy in ovarian cancer HEY
cells instead of Akt/mTOR cascade (data not shown).
In the present study, GA-increased autophagy occurred
mainly by the activation of IRE1α-JNK/c-jun cascade in
NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells (Figures 5, 6, 7 and
Supplementary Figures S5–S7). Activation of JNK was
shown to induce the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, disruption
of Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex, and release of Beclin1 to
induce autophagy [52]. However, GA-induced autophagy
by JNK activation is not correlated with the Bcl-2/Beclin1
complex (Supplementary Figure S13). Inhibition of
autophagy or JNK/c-jun cascade sharply increased GA-

induced ER stress (Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure
S8), which may be attributed to the ER stress caused by
the accumulation of unfolded proteins and autophagy
being a metabolic pathway that clears misfolded and
damaged proteins [14, 53].
The effects of autophagy (prosurvival or prodeath)
depend on stimulators and cell types [54]. For instance,
inhibition of autophagy increases the anti-hepatocellular
carcinoma effects of linifanib but decreases the antirhabdomyosarcoma effects of piperlongumine [22, 40,
55]. The cytotoxicity of gefitinib to glioma cells mainly
contributes to autophagy, whereas autophagy induced
by gefitinib in lung cancer cells is cytoprotective [56,
57]. In the current study, inhibition of GA-induced
autophagy or JNK/c-jun pathway remarkably increased
GA-induced cell proliferative inhibition and apoptosis
(Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure S9), suggesting GAinduced cytoprotective autophagy in NSCLC A549 and
NCI-H1299 cells. However, IRE1α knockdown failed
to increase GA-induced cell proliferative inhibition and
apoptosis. This may be owing to the IRE1α induced not
only autophagy but apoptosis as well, and the prodeath

apoptosis effect of IRE1α potentially balanced prosurvival
autophagy [41]. Moreover, the JNK/c-jun pathway could
potentially contribute to autophagy instead of apoptosis in
A549 cells [58].
In conclusion, we demonstrated that GA induced
autophagy in NSCLC A549 and NCI-H1299 cells by
activation of the IRE1α-JNK/c-jun cascade and that
suppression of autophagy remarkably increases GAinduced cell proliferative inhibition, apoptosis, and ER
stress (Figure 10). This finding further illustrates the
correlation of ER stress, JNK/c-jun, and autophagy.
Combined treatment of an autophagy inhibitor (e.g., CQ)
and GA or GA-contained prescriptions shows potential as
a strategy for NSCLC therapy.

were treated with the indicated concentrations of the test
compounds. Fresh medium with 1 mg/mL MTT was added
to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37°C.
The medium was discarded, and 100 μL of DMSO was
added to the wells to dissolve the violet formazan crystals.
The absorbance of the solution at 570 nm was recorded
with a microplate reader (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel
Counter Victor3, Wellesley, MA, USA).

Clone formation assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 400 cells/well in
six-well plates. After attachment, the cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of GA for 24 h. The
medium was discarded, and the cells were cultured for
another 14 d in fresh medium until visible colonies were
observed. The cells were then washed with PBS and
subsequently fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for
30 min. Crystal violet staining solution (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, China) was used to stain the cells for 30
min. The dye was then washed with PBS, and cell images
were captured using an ordinary NIKON camera.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and antibodies
GA was acquired from the National Institutes for
Food and Drug Control in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-Diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), SP600125, chloroquine (CQ), and
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO, USA). PD98059 and 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Beyotime
Biotechnology Corporation–Shanghai (Shanghai, China).
RPMI1640 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin,
streptomycin, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were
purchased from Gibco Life Technologies (Grand Island,
NY, USA). Hoechst 33342 was obtained from Molecular
Probes (Grand Island, USA). Primary antibodies,
including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
Beclin1, ATG5, ATG7, LC3, p-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204),
ERK, p-Akt (Ser473), Akt, p-mTOR (Ser2448), mTOR,
p-P70 S6k (Ser371), P70 S6K, p-4E-BP1 (Thr37/46),
4E-BP1, p-ULK1 (757), ULK1, p-JNK (Thr183/
Tyr185), JNK, p-c-jun (ser63), c-jun, IRE1α, XBP-1s,
Bip, and Chop, together with GAPDH antibodies and
secondary antibodies, were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA).

Annexin V/PI staining assay
After treatment with various GA concentrations for
24 h, the cells were trypsinized, washed, and collected.
Apoptotic cells were detected using an Annexin V-FITC
kit (Beyotime Biotechnology Corporation, Shanghai,
China) in accordance with the protocol provided by the
manufacturer. A total of 10,000 cells were subsequently
collected and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCanto, BD Bioscience, USA).

Hoechst 33342 staining assay
Cells were exposed to various GA concentrations for
24 h, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde
for 30 min. The cells were then stained with 1 μg/mL
Hoechst 33342 for 30 min. After PBS washing, nuclei were
observed using In Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK), and cell images were obtained.

Cell culture

Western blot analysis

A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were acquired
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1%
(v/v) antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin). The cells were maintained in an incubator
set to 37°C with 5% CO2.

After GA treatment, protein expression levels were
evaluated by Western blot. The proteins were initially lysed
with a radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing
1% phosphatase inhibitor, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride,
and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail for 25 min. The protein
concentrations of the lysates were then examined using
BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Equal quantities of proteins were subjected to sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and

Cell viability assay

blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at 37°C. The
membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C and then incubated with corresponding
secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37°C. The specific protein
bands were visualized with an ECL advanced Western
blot analysis detection kit (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA,
USA). Equal protein loading was verified by probing with
anti-GAPDH antibodies.

After seeding in a 96-well plate overnight, A549
cells were transiently transfected with GFP-LC3 or mRFPGFP-LC3 plasmids for 24 h with or without subsequent 24
h transfection with specific siRNAs (i.e., scrambled, ATG
7, JNK, and IRE1α siRNAs). The cells were incubated
with the indicated compounds for 24 h. After incubation,
the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, washed with PBS, and
incubated with DAPI for 15 min. Immunofluorescence
images were obtained using In Cell Analyzer 2000.

Caspase-3/7 activity assay
Caspase activity assay kits (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) were used to detect
caspase activities in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were plated into 96-well plates
and cultured for about 24 h. Cells were then incubated
with different concentrations of GA with or without
pretreatment of CQ or specific knockdown of ATG7,
JNK, and IRE1α. 200 μL of caspase-3/7 assay reagent
was added to each well and incubated in the dark for
1 h. Luminescence was detected using a microplate
reader (Perkin Elmer, 1420 Multilabel Counter Victor3,
Wellesley, MA, USA).

Statistical analysis
The mean ± standard deviation was determined
for each group. Statistical analysis was performed using
ANOVA and Tukey’s test. Each experiment had at least
three independent replicates, and significant differences
were indicated as *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.
