NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Characterization of the direct effects of DNA damaging agents shows how DNA lesions lead to
specific mutations. Yet, serum from Hiroshima survivors, Chernobyl liquidators, and radiotherapy
patients can induce a clastogenic effect on naive cells, showing indirect induction of genomic
instability that persists years after exposure. Such indirect effects are not restricted to ionizing
radiation, as chemical genotoxins also induce heritable and transmissible genomic instability
phenotypes. While such indirect induction of genomic instability is well described, the underlying
mechanism has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells
exposed to γ-radiation remember the insult for weeks. Specifically, conditioned media from
progeny of exposed cells can induce DNA damage and homologous recombination in naive cells.
Notably, cells exposed to conditioned media also elicit a genome destabilizing effect on their
neighbours, thus demonstrating transmission of genomic instability. Moreover, we show that the
underlying basis for the memory of an insult is completely dependent on two of the major DNA
cytosine methyltransferases (MTases), Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a. Targeted disruption of these genes in
exposed cells completely eliminates transmission of genomic instability. Furthermore, transient
inactivation of Dnmt1, using a tet-suppressible allele, clears the memory of the insult, thus
protecting neighbouring cells from indirect induction of genomic instability. We have thus
demonstrated that a single exposure can lead to long-term, genome destabilizing effects that
spread from cell to cell and we provide a specific molecular mechanism for these persistent
bystander effects. Collectively, our results impact current understanding of risks from toxin
exposures and suggest modes of intervention for suppressing genomic instability in people
exposed to carcinogenic genotoxins.

Introduction
It is well established that DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and chemical
genotoxins, can directly induce mutations that in turn promote cancer and ageing (Friedberg,
2006; Hoeijmakers, 2009). Less well understood, but increasingly appreciated, are the
indirect effects of such exposures on genomic stability. For example, cells can suffer a
persistent, increased frequency of mutations, many cell generations after the original
exposure (Kadhim, 1992; Little et al., 1990). Additionally, naïve cells cultured in the

presence of the descendents of exposed cells similarly display an increased frequency of
genetic changes (Huo, 2001; Nagasawa, 1992; Zhou et al., 2000). These indirect effects of
exposure to DNA damaging agents are conventionally described as persistent or bystander
effects (Bender, 1962; Morgan, 2003).
A variety of phenotypes have been observed to persist, long after an initial genotoxic
exposure. A classic example is delayed reproductive cell death, and reduced plating
efficiency, which can persist for more than fifty generations after exposure (Chang and
Little, 1992). In addition, de novo genetic changes occur many cell divisions after exposure
(Kadhim, 1992; Pampfer, 1989; Seymour and Mothersill, 2004). As with persistent effects,
many different phenotypes have been associated with the bystander effect. Naïve bystander
cells cultured in the presence of either cells that have been previously exposed to a
genotoxic agent, or to media from exposed cultures, are prone to genomic instability,
toxicity and malignant transformation (Huo, 2001; Lewis, 2001; Little, 2003; Nagar, 2003;
Nagasawa, 1992; Zhou et al., 2000).

An understanding of the mechanisms involved in persistent and transmissible responses to
genotoxins is clearly important to human health, given the ubiquitous presence of DNA
damaging agents endogenously, in our environment, and in the clinic. Indeed, since the
initial discovery of genotoxicity-associated persistent and bystander phenotypes, the
underlying causes, physiological impact, and mechanistic aetiology of these responses have
been intensively studied (Morgan and Sowa, 2005; Mothersill and Seymour, 2005;
Mothersill, 2006). Traditionally, persistent and bystander phenotypes have been studied in
response to high doses of ionizing radiation (Mothersill, 2001). However more recently,
these phenotypes have also been generated by non-ionizing radiation e.g. ultra violet (UV)
radiation (Limoli, 1998; Mothersill, 1998), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Azzam,
2002; Dickey, 2009), cytokines (Dickey, 2009) and other genotoxic, chemical exposures
(Rugo, 2005). Thus, because endogenously generated chemical species (e.g. cytokines and
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) and exogenous agents to which cells are
physiologically exposed (e.g. UV and low dose IR radiation), are capable of initiating
persistent and bystander phenotypes alike, it is reasonable to posit that these responses
represent normal, physiologically relevant, cellular responses to stressors. Consistent with
this viewpoint, are observations of persistent and bystander phenotypes not only at the
cellular, but at the tissue (Goldberg, 2002; Koturbash, 2006; Mothersill, 2002; Pant, 1977;
Watson et al., 2000a) and even organism level of organisation (Mothersill et al., 2007).
Further, these responses appear to be evolutionarily conserved across different kingdoms
and species (Yang et al., 2008).

Intense interest in the underlying mechanism of the bystander effect has prompted studies
that have revealed many of the agents capable of inducing persistent and bystander
phenotypes, as discussed above. Much less is known, however, about the mechanism by
which cells retain and consequently transmit ‘memory’ of an insult, becoming genomically
unstable for a long time after exposure. Earlier work in our laboratory showed that genomic
instability was transmissible from one cell to the next (i.e., a bystander can induce genomic
instability in a naïve cell over multiple generations) (Rugo, 2005). This transmission of
genomic instability, while implying heritability, clearly is not consistent with genetic
inheritance. Thus our findings, and related observations by others (e.g., (Kovalchuk, 2008;
Lorimore, 2003), suggest that persistent and bystander effects might be propagated by an
hitherto unknown epigenetic mechanism.
Epigenetic mechanisms of heredity include DNA methylation, histone modification and the
functions of certain non-coding RNAs (Goldberg, 2007). Importantly, DNA methylation has
been implicated in heritable, persistent changes in phenotype. For example, the persistent

and heritable change in coat colour, and conferred obesity-resistance in the progeny of
female mice that were fed genistein during gestation, were found to be DNA methylationdependent (Dolinoy, 2006). Here, we show that DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the
enzymes responsible for the epigenetic methylation of mammalian DNA, mediate the
propagation of an instability phenotype on exposure to a genotoxin. Specifically, we find
that DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3a mediate murine embryonic stem (ES) cell memory of
an exposure to ionizing radiation.

Results and discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ionizing radiation is of great societal importance, both in the context of the environment and
the clinic. To learn if γ-radiation leads to persistent transmissible instability in ES cells,
DNA damage was assessed in bystanders. Naive cells, designated primary bystanders (Fig.
1a), that shared media with cells descended from irradiated cultures showed increased DNA
damage (Fig. 1b), while naïve cells that shared media with sham-irradiated cells showed no
increase in DNA damage by comet assay. To test for transmission of this DNA damage, a
second group of naive WT cells, designated secondary bystanders, were co-cultured with the
primary bystanders (Fig. 1a). These secondary bystanders had increased DNA damage when
exposed to media from primary bystanders to irradiated cells (Fig. 1c), thus demonstrating
transmission of radiation-induced genomic instability from exposed cells, to naive cells
(primary bystanders), to naive cells (secondary bystanders).
To determine whether persistent instability results from methyltransferase-dependent
epigenetic changes, we exploited the fact that ES cells do not require genome methylation
for viability, and are readily cultured, following disruption of the three major DNA MTases:
Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Tsumura, 2006). During normal development, the Dnmt3a
and Dnmt3b de novo MTases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl
methionine to the 5 position of cytosine at CpG sites (Chen, 1991). Methylation is
maintained primarily through the activity of Dnmt1, which efficiently methylates
hemimethylated CpG sites (Stein, 1982). Dnmt1 is essential for heritable, epigenetically
regulated changes in gene expression that are key to differentiation and development (Li,
1992). To test the possible role of MTases in cellular memory of an insult, we asked if
Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells (gift of M. Okano) were able to remember and
transmit genomic instability following γ-radiation. Results show that descendents of
irradiated Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells were not able to induce DNA damage by
comet assay in neighbouring cells, when compared to WT cells (Fig. 2a).

One of the earliest descriptions of a bystander effect in cultured cells revealed that when
~1% of nuclei were irradiated, over 30% of the cells had increased homologous
recombination, detected as sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (Nagasawa, 1992).
Furthermore, ionizing radiation induces a persistent increase in homologous recombination
(Huang et al., 2007). We therefore asked if SCEs are induced by the progeny of irradiated
WT and Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells. Naive cells indeed exhibited a significant
increase (p<0.0001) in the frequency of SCEs when they shared media with descendents of
irradiated cultures (Fig. 2b). However, there was only a very slight, yet significant
(p=0.0168), increase in SCEs when the irradiated cells were Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-;
Dnmt3b-/- cells, compared to mock irradiated Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells.
Interestingly, SCEs were increased in cells that shared media with unirradiated Dnmt1-/-;
Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- ES cells, compared to cells that shared media with unirradiated WT
ES cells (Fig. 2b). Given that Dnmt1-/- cells are genomically unstable (Chen et al., 1998;
Kim et al., 2004), Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- ES cells may be similarly unstable and
may thus elicit transmissible responses, analogous to the effects of irradiation. Regardless,
progeny of irradiated Dnmt1-/-; Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells are less able than WT cells to

induce genomic instability in naive neighbours, showing that one or more MTases are
essential for persistent radiation-induced instability.

To discern the roles of individual MTases, we analyzed ES cells carrying targeted
disruptions of each MTase (gift of E. Li) (Lei et al., 1996; Okano et al., 1999). The MTase
deficient cells have normal sensitivity to radiation toxicity (data not shown). Interestingly, γradiation had no effect on SCEs in primary bystanders to irradiated Dnmt1-/- cells, when
compared to bystanders to unirradiated Dnmt1-/- cells (Fig. 3). The inability of the Dnmt1-/cells to sustain a heritable phenotypic change is consistent with their hypomethylated
phenotype (Lei et al., 1996). In addition, Dnmt1-/- cells induce homologous recombination
in neighbouring cells, even without irradiation, which is consistent with their instability
phenotype (Chen et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2004). Although Dnmt1 is a maintenance MTase,
it is possible that Dnmt1’s ability to perform de novo methylation in response to DNA
damage (Mortusewicz et al., 2005) contributes to the transmissible instability. Similar to
Dnmt1-/- cells, Dnmt3a-/- cells did not transmit genomic instability (Fig. 3), indicating that
Dnmt3a-mediated de novo methylation is necessary for cells to remember and transmit an
instability phenotype. Interestingly, as with Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/- cells caused an increase
(P<0.0001) in SCEs in bystanding WT cells in the absence of radiation, when compared to
SCE levels in WT bystanders to unirradiated WT cells. Lastly, unlike Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a,
Dnmt3b was not essential for transmissible instability, as a deficiency in this gene still
resulted in transmission of an instability phenotype (Fig. 3).
The observation that genomic instability is induced by unirradiated Dnmt1-/- and Dnmt1-/-;
Dnmt3a-/-; Dnmt3b-/- cells suggested a possible threshold that prevents further induction of
instability after irradiation. We hypothesized that transient loss of Dnmt1 might prevent
memory of genotoxic exposure, while protecting bystanders from the instability due to
Dnmt1 loss. To test this hypothesis, we exploited mouse ES cells carrying a tetracycline
repressible Dnmt1 allele (Borowczyk et al., in press). By three days post doxycycline
treatment, Dnmt1 was undetectable, and within three days after removing doxycycline,
Dnmt1 expression resumed (Fig. 4a). To suppress Dnmt1 expression before, during and after
irradiation, we added doxycycline three days before irradiation and sustained it for seven
days. Doxycycline was then removed to restore Dnmt1 expression (Fig. 4a). Consistent with
previous results (Figures 2 and 3), the descendants of irradiated WT cells induced
homologous recombination in neighbouring cells. However, under conditions where Dnmt1
was transiently suppressed, descendents of irradiated cells were not able to induce
homologous recombination in their neighbours (Fig. 4b). Importantly, unlike the cells that
carried disrupted Dnmt1 alleles, cells transiently suppressed for Dnmt1 do not induce
instability in their neighbours.

The transmissibility of genomic instability through shared media has important implications
when considering potential tissue-wide responses in vivo. To explore transmissibility, we
studied secondary bystanders. Primary bystanders were able to induce homologous
recombination in naive cells only if the irradiated target cells had had normal Dnmt1
expression (Fig. 4b). Thus, transient suppression of Dnmt1 prevented transmission of
instability both to naïve primary bystanders, and to their secondary bystander neighbours.
Characterizing the underlying causes of genomic instability is fundamental in cancer
aetiology, prevention of premature ageing, and for understanding the risks of exposures. It is
becoming increasingly clear that indirect mechanisms of mutation induction that involve
changes in cellular behaviour, in addition to the directly induced DNA lesions, can lead to
an increased risk of disease-causing mutations for months or even years after exposure
(Lorimore et al., 2003; Maxwell et al., 2008; Morgan, 2003; Mothersill and Seymour, 2001;

Pant, 1977). Furthermore, at least one study suggests that the extent of bystander-induced
DNA damage can be as great as that of the original exposure (Dickey et al., 2009).

While the studies described here do not query the exact mechanism by which DNA
methylation results in persistent bystander phenotypes, it is possible that changes in gene
expression, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (Hermann, 2004), cause cells to secrete
factors that impact genomic stability. Specifically, DNA damage is known to alter Dnmt1
and Dnmt3a activity (Maltseva, 2009; Mortusewicz, 2005) and DNA damage can also alter
secretion profiles (Rodier et al., 2009). Additionally, it is known that cells that secrete TNFalpha, NO· and TGF-beta can induce DNA damage in nearby cells (Burr, 2010; Dickey,
2009). Thus, as a result of exposure to secreted, genotoxic species, bystander cells could
adopt a methylation pattern similar to that of the target cell, and thus both remember and
transmit a bystander phenotype. The memory of the genotoxic insult would therefore be
stored structurally in DNA in the form of DNA methylation patterns that are created and
maintained by DNA methyltrasferases (e.g., Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a). Propagation of the
bystander phenotype could then be effected by a change in the secretion profile of the
insulted cell. Interestingly, in normal tissues, communication among cells helps to control
cell behaviour. Bystander effects may similarly reflect a coordinated response.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The observation that genomic instability can be transmitted from cell to cell, both in vitro
(Lorimore et al., 2003; Mothersill and Seymour, 2004; Nagasawa and Little, 1992) and in
vivo (Lorimore et al., 2005; Watson et al., 2000b), opens the possibility that there are tissue
wide changes in genomic stability following exposure to a genotoxin, and calls attention to
the possibility that persistent and bystander effects are critical risk factors for disease. Here,
we have demonstrated that two of the three major MTases, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a, are essential
in order for descendents of irradiated cells to become able to transmit genomic instability to
naive cells. Furthermore, we have shown that by temporarily turning off expression of
Dnmt1, it is possible to completely eliminate transmission of genomic instability.
Interestingly, and indeed consistent with these findings, Dnmt1 and 3a have also recently
been shown to play important roles in neurological memory and learning (Feng et al., 2010).
This finding, albeit apparent specifically in neurons, may represent a general mechanism by
which cells store information on, and adapt to, genotoxic and other stimuli.
In conclusion, knowledge of the molecular basis for transmission of genomic instability
opens the doors to novel interventions, including the potential administration of Dnmt
inhibitors in conjunction with cancer chemotherapy to preserve tissue-wide genomic
stability and thus suppress secondary cancers.

a, Irradiated (or mock irradiated) target ES cells are cultured for three weeks. During the
three weeks, cells were passaged three times a week at densities of 0.5-2×106 cells per
55mm2 dish. After three weeks, 6×104 naive WT ES cells subsequently shared media with
the progeny of target ES cells for 5 days (to create primary bystanders). Primary bystanders
were then cultured for another three weeks. Naive WT ES cells then shared media with the
progeny of primary bystanders (to create secondary bystanders). Media was shared via coculture, employing 1 μm transwell inserts (Corning), or by exposure to conditioned media
(filtered [0.25μm]; 1:1, fresh media:conditioned media). ES cells were exposed to ionizing
radiation (3 Gy) using a Co-60 source (73 cGy/min). DNA damage was assessed by the
alkaline comet assay (Olive, 2006) in primary (b), and secondary (c), bystanders. For all
comet analysis, >100 nucleoids were analyzed per condition using Komet 5.5 (Andor
Technology, Ireland) and P values were produced by a two-tailed Mann-Whitney. For comet
studies, boxes represent the quartiles, whiskers mark the 10th and 90th percentiles, and the
median is indicated. For all studies, data was combined from three or more independent
experiments.

DNA damage by comet assay (a) and SCEs (b) in naive WT ES cells exposed to media from
WT and Dnmt1-/- Dnmt3a-/- Dnmt3b-/- cells. See Fig. 1 for experimental design. SCEs
were counted for ≥80 spreads/condition as previously described (Engelward et al., 1996).
For SCE studies, median with interquartile range is shown and P values were produced by a
two-tailed t-test.
