Abstract
Strategies to address resistance to platin drugs are greatly needed in human epithelial cancers (e.g., ovarian,
head/neck, and lung) where platins are used widely and resistance occurs commonly. We found that upon
DNp63a overexpression, AKT1 and phospho-AKT1 levels are upregulated in cancer cells. Investigations using
gel-shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation and functional reporter assays implicated DNp63a in positive
regulation of AKT1 transcription. Importantly, we found that DNp63a, AKT1, and phospho-AKT levels are
greater in 2008CI3 CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells than in 2008 CDDP-sensitive cells. siRNA-mediated
knockdown of DNp63a expression dramatically decreased AKT1 expression, whereas knockdown of either
DNp63a or AKT1 decreased cell proliferation and increased death of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells.
Conversely, enforced expression of DNp63a increased cancer cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Together,
our findings define a novel DNp63a-dependent regulatory mechanism for AKT1 expression and its role in
chemotherapeutic resistance of ovarian and head/neck cancer cells. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1167–76. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) is used for
treating various human cancers (e.g., head and neck, ovarian
and lung cancer), however, its efficiency is limited due to
development of drug resistance by tumor cells (1). CDDPinduced programmed cell death is associated with expression
of specific "cell death" genes and downregulation of "survival"
genes (2). Failure of cancer cells to maintain expression of the
former genes may be an important factor in chemoresistance
(3–6). AKT negatively regulates many of the key cell death
effector molecules, therefore rendering cancer cells CDDP
resistant, whereas AKT inhibition reversed the CDDP-resistance phenotype (3–6).
P53 homolog p63 encodes several isoforms serving as
transcription factors promoting cell death or cell survival
(7–12). TAp63 isoforms consist of the long transactivation
(TA)-domain, DNA-binding domain, oligomerization domain,
and carboxyl-terminus domain of various length (a, b, and g),
whereas DNp63 isoforms that lack of the TA-domain present
in TAp63 isoforms are acting as prosurvival regulators (13–17).

DNp63a is predominantly overexpressed in epithelial cancers
playing an important role in the DNA damage response (8, 10,
13–19). p63 was shown to be amplified and overexpressed in
all head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells
derived from primary tumors tested, and DNp63 isoforms can
enhance tumor growth and activate the oncogenic b-catenin
pathway (13, 14). DNp63a is phosphorylated by ATM-dependent mechanism following CDDP treatment functioning as a
prosurvival factor in HNSCC cells (18, 19). Furthermore,
DNp63 or DNp73 were shown playing a crucial role in determining the cellular chemosensitivity (8, 10, 20–26). Here, we
uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which DNp63a
positively regulates AKT1 transcription inducing cell survival
and chemoresistance to CDDP.

Califano, JHMI; refs. 27, 28), and human non–small cell lung
carcinoma cell line H1299 (null for p53 and p63 expression at
the RNA and protein levels tested by RT-PCR and immunoblotting) from the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC,
according to the certificate, H1299 cell line, (#CRL-5803), was
tested for multiple genetic markers and showed the p53
homozygous partial deletion and lack of p53 protein, H1299
showed no p63 expression; refs. 16, 29]. We also used isogenic
CDDP-sensitive (OV2008) and its CDDP-resistant (OV2008C13*) ovarian cancer cells (wild-type p53, characterized,
tested and kindly given by Prof. Stephen B. Howell, UCSD;
ref. 30). The cell lines were authenticated by a short tandem
repeat profiling analysis using the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR
Amplification Lit (Applied Biosystems) with the following 16
markers: amelogenin, CSF1PO, D12S317, D16S539, D18S51,

D8S1179, FGA, THO1, TPOX, and VWA at the JHMI Fragment
Analysis Facility. Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
with 10% FBS. Cells were transiently transfected using
FuGENE HD reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 72
hours. 20 nmol/L of control siRNA, DNp63a siRNAs (1 and 2),
and TAp63a siRNAs (all from Dharmacon) and AKT1 siRNA
(Cell Signaling Technology) were introduced into cells using
Lipofectamine SiRNAMAX reagent. Cells were treated with
control media or 10 mg/mL CDDP for indicated time periods.

the presence or absence of the pGL3-Basic vector and the pRLCMV plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (Promega). Firefly
and Renilla luciferase activities were analyzed by the Dual
Luciferase Activity assay Kit (Promega), monitored by luminometer, and the Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to
Renilla luciferase activity. Each transfection was performed in
duplicate, and all experiments were repeated in triplicate.

Plasmid constructs
The DNp63a-Flag, 6-His-DNp63a, and TAp63a-Flag fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen). We used the pLNCX-HA-AKT1 expression cassette
(Addgene) and the AKT1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct, pGL3B-AKT1-1400 (a gift from Dr. Susanne Dihlmann,
University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; ref. 31).

Cellular viability assay
Cell proliferation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl
thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide proliferation
assay kit (MTT, ATCC) as previously described (16). A total
of 104 cells were incubated in dark for 4 hours at 37o C with
10 mL of MTT labeling reagent (5 mg/mL) in the serum-free
culture media and cell lysates were monitored at A570nm to
A650nm on a Spectra Max 250 96-well plate reader (Molecular
Devices) after 2 hours. Diagrams indicated the extent of
cellular survival expressed as a percentage of control.

Immunoblotting analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 100
mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid,
0.1% SDS, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 10 mmol/L NaF, supplemented with 1 mmol/L PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma)]. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (16).
Semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 1  106 cells using RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using qScript
cDNA SuperMix kit (Quanta Biosciences). PCR products
amplified with semi-qPCR primers (Supplementary Table 1)
were quantified by ethidium bromide staining. In tumor tissue
samples from patients, the levels of AKT1 and DNp63a were
determined by real-time qRT-PCR with Fast SYBR Green
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with 50 nmol/L each qPCR
primer (Supplementary Table. 2) and the levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
values.
Promoter luciferase activity assays
JHU-022 cells were transfected with the pGL3B-AKT1-1400
(31) along with 0.5 mg of the DNp63a and TAp63a plasmids in

TUNEL assay
DNA damage was quantified with a colorimetric apoptosis
detection kit (Titer TACS; R&D Systems) that uses TUNEL
stain in a 96-well format according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. Reaction absorbance was measured at A450
nm with microplate reader along with a positive control
(nuclease-treated).
Caspase-3 cleavage assay
Caspase-3 activity was measured using the Colorimetric
Caspase-3 Assay Kit (Calbiochem). The 2  105 cells per 10 mL
supernatants were incubated with 200 mmol/L Ac-DEVD-pNA
substrate at 37 C in the presence or absence of 0.1 mmol/L
caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) for 3 hours and then
were monitored at the A405nm. Relative increase in caspase3 activity was determined by comparing with the untreated
control.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Flag-DNp63a and Flag-TAp63a constructs or siRNAs were
introduced into JHU-022 or H1299 cells. A ChIP kit (Upstate
Cell Signaling Solutions) along with the p63 (4A4) antibody
was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
as previously described (19, 32, 33). Primers used for ChIP
assay shown in Supplementary Figure 1. PCR consisted of 30
cycles of 94 C for 1 minute, 58 C for 1 minute, and 72 C for 30
seconds using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen).
Gel-shift assay
6HisDNp63a protein was purified from HEK293 cells
through TALON beads (BD Biosciences) confirmed by Coomassie staining/immunoblotting. One picomole of each DNA
probe (Supplementary Fig. 1) was annealed, labeled with
[g-32P]-ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Perkin–Elmer) using T4 kinase
(New England Biolabs), purified through a QIAquick Spin
Columns (QIAGEN) and counted in liquid scintillation counter LS6000IC (Beckman). Five micrograms of purified protein
was incubated with 100 fmol of radioactive probe in 10 mL of
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L DTT,

Results
CDDP exposure decreased DNp63a and AKT1
expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner
We found that with increasing concentrations (2.5–10.0
mmol/L, for 24 hours; Fig. 1A) and increasing time periods

of CDDP exposure (10 mmol/L for 0–24 hours; Fig. 1B) the
DNp63a, AKT1 and p-AKT1 endogenous levels decreased in
JHU-022 cells.
We then exposed H1299 cells (null for both p53 and p63
expression) transfected with an empty vector to control media
or 25 mmol/L CDDP for 0 to 24 hours (Supplemnetary Fig. 2).
We found no changes in AKT1 levels in cells without DNp63a
transfection after CDDP exposure (Supplementary. Fig. 2a).
However, CDDP exposure led to a down regulation of exogenous DNp63a levels and concomitantly to a decrease of
AKT1 level in H1299 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). These data
suggest that the CDDP-dependent decrease in AKT1 level
resulted from DNp63a downregulation.
DNp63a modulates AKT1 expression
Supporting previous reports (13–16, 25), we showed that
DNp63 is the predominant p63 isoform in HNSCC cells, as

DNp63a mRNA is 100-fold more abundant than TAp63 mRNA
in JHU-022 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
We transfected JHU-022 cells with increasing concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg) of DNp63a plasmid. Using
semi-qRT-PCR and immunoblotting (Fig. 1C; Supplementary.
Fig. 2c), we found that DNp63a induction caused a significant
increase in AKT1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels,
and p-AKT1 levels. Silencing of TAp63a or DNp63a in JHU-022
cells using TAp63a-siRNA and DNp63a-siRNA (1 and 2) led to
a reduction of endogenous TAp63a and DNp63a levels,
respectively (Fig. 1D). Intriguingly, downregulation of DNp63a
by DNp63a-siRNA (1 and 2, which downregulated TAp63a and
DNp63a, Supplementary Fig. 2d) resulted in decreased AKT1
and p-AKT1 levels in JHU-022 cell line (Fig. 1D). In contrast,
TAp63a-siRNA transfection (which exclusively downregulated
TAp63a) showed no change in AKT1 expression (Fig. 1D;
Supplementary. Fig. 2d, upper section). However, the AKT1
knockdown by AKT1-siRNA did not affect DNp63a expression
(Supplementary Fig. 2d, lower section).

Transcriptional regulation of AKT1 expression
by DNp63a
To examine the effect of DNp63a on the AKT1 transcription, we used the pGL3B-AKT1-1400 luciferase construct,
which spans 1,400 base pairs upstream of the transcription
start site (31). By the luciferase reporter assay, we found that
in contrast to TAp63a, DNp63a significantly increased the
AKT1 promoter activity (Fig. 2A). We then performed gelshift assay with the purified 6His-tagged DNp63a protein
and 4 DNA probes designated as AKT1 oligos #1, #2, #3, and
#4 derived from the AKT1 promoter sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1). By computer analysis of the AKT1 promoter
sequence, we found a few putative p63 responsive elements
(P63RE: 941 to 924, 762 to 739, 631 to 618, 499 to
477 and 214 to 189; Supplementary Fig. 1) as previously
defined (33). Using gel-shift assay, we found that the DNp63a
protein binds most strongly with AKT1 #3 compared
with other oligos (Fig. 2B) in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2C).

transfection cells were transfected
with or without 1 mg of AKT1
construct. After 24 h of AKT1
transfection, cells were treated
with 10 mmol/L CDDP for 24 hours.
Cell viability was evaluated by the
(A–D) MTT, (B) caspase-3, and
TUNEL assays, and
immunoblotting analysis of
caspase-3 and PARP-1 cleavage.
For various experiments, MTT
values from control siRNA, empty
vector, or untransfected cells were
taken as 100%.

We then performed ChIP analysis in JHU-022 and H1299
cells transfected with or without DNp63a or TAp63a (Fig. 2D).
Using the anti-p63 antibody, we found that DNp63a displayed
a strong binding to the AKT1 promoter, whereas TAp63 failed
to do so (Fig. 2D). DNp63a siRNA knockdown caused a
significant decrease in its binding to the AKT1 promoter
(Fig. 2D). Altogether these results supported the notion that
DNp63a directly regulates AKT1 transcription.
DNp63a increases cell viability through AKT1
expression
We next subjected both JHU-022 and H1299 cells to the p63
forced expression and JHU-022 cells to the p63 siRNA knockdown

followed by the MTT assay. We found that the DNp63a overexpression led to a significant increase in basal survival (Fig. 3A),
and survival upon CDDP exposure (Fig. 3B). However, no effect on
survival was found in cells transfected with TAp63a (Fig. 3B). We
next observed that the AKT1 overexpression led to an increased
survival of cells exposed to CDDP as corroborated by MTT,
TUNEL, caspase-3, and PARP-1 cleavage assays (Fig. 3B).
We then found that the DNp63a silencing significantly
decreased the survival of JHU-022 cells (Fig. 3C), which was
further decreased after resulting cells were treated with CDDP
(Fig. 3C). However, no effect was observed with TAp63asiRNA (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, AKT1-siRNA significantly
decreased cell survival upon CDDP exposure (Fig. 3C).

JHU-022 cells were also transfected with HA-AKT1 plasmid
followed by DNp63a-siRNA transfection after 24 hours. We
found that the AKT1 forced expression increased the cell
survival after DNp63a silencing (Fig. 3D). However, when cells
were transfected with DNp63a followed by AKT1 siRNA,
DNp63a forced expression failed to increase the cell survival
after AKT1 silencing (Fig. 3D). Taken together these data
support the notion that AKT1 is acting downstream of
DNp63a and that DNp63a expression is a regulator of
increased cell survival and CDDP chemoresistance.

than in OV2008 cells (Fig. 4A). In both OV2008 and OV2008CI3
cells, DNp63a siRNA effectively decreased total AKT1 and pAKT1 levels compared with control and TAp63a knockdown
(Fig. 4B, top). Both OV2008 and OV2008CI3 cells also showed
significant increase in AKT1 and p-AKT1 levels after increasing concentrations of exogenous DNp63a (Fig. 4B, bottom).
Although CDDP significantly reduced DNp63a and concurrently AKT1 and p-AKT1 levels in OV2008 cells, it failed to
significantly affect these levels in OV2008CI3 cells (Fig. 4C).
Using ChIP assay, we found that the DNp63a protein bound to
the AKT1 promoter to a greater degree in resistant cells than
in sensitive cells (Fig. 4D) suggesting the importance of the
DNp63a/AKT1 promoter relationship in CDDP-mediated chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells.
We further found that DNp63a and AKT1-siRNA significantly decreased the basal survival of resistant OV2008-CI3

cleavage in cells transfected with the DNp63a or AKT1 siRNA
were significantly higher than in cells with the siRNA TAp63a

tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3a). By real-time qPCR, no p63
copy number variation was observed for the pair of CDDPsensitive OV2008 and CDDP-resistant OV2008C13 ovarian cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. 3b, left graph). No significant difference was also observed between similar groups of patients’
samples (Supplementary Fig. 3b, right graph). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we further validated the DNp63 and
AKT1 expression in tissue biopsies from HNSCC patients
(tissue microarray, 48 single cores; Supplementary Fig. 3c).
We observed the concomitant expression of DNp63 and AKT1
(Supplementary Fig. 3c), when higher DNp63 levels strongly
correlated with higher AKT1 levels, and higher DNp63/AKT1
levels well correlated with more advanced tumor stage
[þþþ/þþ in T3N0-T4N2 (18/24), þþ/þ in T1N0-T2N1
(17/24)]. By IHC, we further observed greater expression of
DNp63 and AKT1 in biopsies from patients with head and
neck cancer (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and ovarian tumors

biopsies from patients with CDDP-sensitive tumors. Similar to
the HNSCC, ovarian tumor samples (tissue microarray, 24
samples in duplicate) showed a good correlation of the greater
expression of DNp63 with greater AKT1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 5). Altogether, these data supported the notion
for the important role of DNp63/AKT1 pathway in tumor
progression and cell resistance to CDDP in vivo.
Discussion
We previously reported that an amplification and overexpression of DNp63a is the most common event in all (100%)
primary lung SCC and HNSCC cell lines developed in our
laboratory, including JHU-022 cells (13). A genome-wide
microarray screen of non–small cell lung cancer revealed that
the 3q26–29 locus encompassing p63 is frequently amplified in
squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (11). However, no p63
amplification was found in ovarian cancer tissue samples
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). By real-time PCR analysis, DNp63
levels were shown to dramatically increase in stage III of
ovarian cancer supporting the role for DNp63 as a biomarker
of poor patient survival outcomes and tumor progression (34).

Moreover, patients with a higher DNp63 level demonstrated a
poor response to platinum-based therapy (34).
A few studies addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying the DNp63a prosurvival effect (13–19, 22, 26). DNp63a
was shown to promote tumorigenesis through direct protein–
protein interactions, by direct regulation of target genes, or by
inhibition of the transactivation activity of other p53 family
members (13–21, 23, 26). DNp63a was found to counteract cell
death by repressing the expression of proapoptotic genes (7,
8). DNp63 was shown to induce a growth of tumor cells in vitro
and in vivo, and lead to increased b-catenin accumulation and
signaling (13, 14). Conversely, siRNA knockdown of DNp63a in
malignant cells overexpressing DNp63a resulted in cell death,
accompanied by cleavage of PARP-1 (20). The DNp63a silencing in HNSCC cells induced the expression of proapoptotic
genes, Puma and Noxa, suggesting the DNp63a role in cell
survival (21–26).
Here, we provided evidence that the process of cancer cell
survival under chemotherapeutic treatment is mediated by
functional interplay between DNp63a and AKT1. We found
that the DNp63a expression is higher in CDDP-resistant
cells than in CDDP-sensitive cells and observed that higher

Transcriptional Regulation of AKT1 by DNp63a and Chemoresistance

expression of DNp63a led to AKT1 overexpression, which
consequently made cancer cells become resistant to CDDPinduced cell death. We further found that the DNp63a downregulation followed by decrease in AKT1 level rendered CDDPresistant cells to become more sensitive to CDDP. We also
established the molecular mechanism of the DNp63a-dependent upregulation of AKT1 expression. We showed that
DNp63a significantly activated AKT1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter functional activity. We further showed that
DNp63a protein directly and effectively bound to AKT1 promoter in vitro. By ChIP assay, we found that DNp63a associated with AKT1 promoter in vivo. We believe that DNp63a
directly regulates the AKT1 transcription by binding to the
AKT1 promoter-derived p63RE using the p63 DNA-binding
domain. In addition, DNp63a has been shown to specifically
transactivate certain genes either using its short 14-residue
TA-domain (15, 35–37) or in cooperation with other transcription factors and coactivators/corepressors (38). DNp63a was
also shown to physically associate with the carboxyl terminus
of RNA polymerase II through SRA4 regulatory protein, suggesting a certain role for DNp63a in the transcriptional
initiation (39). Thus, it is likely that the DNp63a-dependent
AKT1 transcriptional regulation requires other transcription
factors and coactivators occupying the AKT1 promoter in vivo
(40, 41). Because many fundamental questions regarding indepth molecular mechanism of p63-dependent transcriptional
regulation of AKT1 expression are beyond the scope of this
work, future investigations needed to thoroughly address
these issues.
The AKT pathway is known to be associated with chemoresistance in human cancers (4, 42–46). We now established a
novel link between DNp63a-dependent transcriptional regulation of AKT1 and DNp63a/AKT1-induced survival of cancer
cells upon cisplatin exposure. The role of the DNp63a/AKT1
pathway in tumor cell survival was supported by AKT1 ability
to rescue JHU-022 cells from cell death induced by DNp63a
silencing. A previous report showed that upregulation of
DNp63a in human keratinocytes after UV exposure could
lead to increase in p-AKT1 levels (S473 and T308) rescuing
cells from cell death (47). Another study demonstrated that

the siRNA knockdown of DNp63a in human squamous carcinomas led to a modulation of AKT1 phosphorylation at the
same residues (48). However, both reports failed to provide the
molecular mechanisms underlying these events.
Our previous observations demonstrated the ability of
DNp63a to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; ref. 14).
PP2A is known to inhibit AKT1 function by dephosphorylation
of S473 and T308 residues that are essential for AKT1 activity
(14). DNp63a overexpression found in HNSCC cells would thus
lead to an increase in the p-AKT levels.
Accumulated evidence demonstrated that overexpression
and activation of AKT1 is common in different human malignancies (42–48). The CDDP-sensitive ovarian cancer cells
transfected with constitutively active AKT1 were shown to
become resistant to CDDP, whereas the dominant-negative
AKT1 overexpression renders CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer
cells susceptible to CDDP-induced cell death (4–6, 45). Our
data obtained from cancer patients’ biopsies showed that
AKT1 and DNp63a levels are concomitantly higher in head/
neck and ovarian tumors resistant to CDDP than in tumors
sensitive to CDDP, further supporting our hypothesis that
AKT1 is a critical mediator of DNp63a-dependent CDDPresistance. Our study establishes a novel functional link
between DNp63a and chemoresistance suggesting that the
transcriptional regulation of AKT1 is one of the mechanisms
through which DNp63a can act as a prosurvival molecule in
cancer.
