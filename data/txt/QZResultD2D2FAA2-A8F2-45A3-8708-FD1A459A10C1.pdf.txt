ABSTRACT
Treatment of remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia (RIH) remains
a clinical challenge because the mechanisms are not fully understood. Matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a key component in neuroinflammation because
of its facilitation of pro-inflammatory cytokine maturation. Therefore, inhibition
of MMP-9 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of RIH.
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: Control, Incision and
Remifentanil. A right plantar surgical incision was performed in Group Incision, and
intraoperative remifentanil (0.04 mg/kg, 0.4 ml) was infused subcutaneously for
30 min in Group Remifentanil. The results indicated that intraoperative remifentanil
induced an up-regulation and activation of MMP-9 in DRGs but not spinal cords. MMP-9
was expressed primarily in DRG neurons co-expressing mu opioid receptors (MOR),
and elicited interleukin-1β (IL-1β) cleavage in DRG neurons and satellite glial cells
(SGCs). Intraperitoneal injection of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a broadly used safe
drug, significantly attenuated RIH via suppressing the activation of MMP-9 in DRGs.
NAC inhibited the cleavage of IL-1β in DRGs, which is a critical substrate of MMP-9,
and markedly suppressed glial activation and neuron excitability in spinal dorsal horn
induced by remifentanil. These results demonstrated that NAC can effectively alleviate
RIH via powerfully inhibiting MMP-9 activation in DRGs.

INTRODUCTION

necrosis factor α (TNF-α), released from activated astrocyte
and microglia, directly activated neuronal NMDAR and
facilitated neuronal plasticity [6, 7]. NMDAR antagonists,
such as ketamine, MK-801 and Ro 25-6981, prevented
the development of RIH in a rat model of incisional pain
[4, 8, 9]. Furthermore, administration of selective chemokine
(C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonist SB225002,
glycogen synthase kinase-3β  (GSK-3β) inhibitor TDZD8, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) inhibitor roscovitine,
or alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAchR)
agonists PHA-543613 can attenuate RIH via regulating
the expression and function of spinal NMDAR [5, 10–12].
Unfortunately, a safe drug, which is effective on RIH and
can be used in the clinic is not yet available.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of
calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases that

Remifentanil is commonly administered intravenously
during general anesthesia. However, it has contrary pronociceptive actions and promotes postoperative hyperalgesia
[1, 2]. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear, a safer
and more effective treatment remains to be found.
The mechanisms of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia
(RIH) might be related to spinal N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor (NMDAR)-dependent central sensitization
[3, 4]. Previous studies indicated that remifentanilinduced postoperative mechanical allodynia and thermal
hyperalgesia was associated with evaluated phosphorylation
of NMDAR subunit 2B (NR2B) in spinal dorsal horn [4, 5].
During the process of RIH, the increase in pro-inflammatory
cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor

are responsible for the cleavage of most extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins and cytokines [13]. The
excessive proteolytic activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in
central and peripheral nervous system, mediates ECM
abnormality, and leads to a variety of neuropathologic
conditions, including neuroinflammatory response
[14, 15], disruption of the blood-brain barrier [16],
and peripheral as well as central hypersensitivity that
participate in hyperalgesia [17]. Specifically, MMP9 and MMP-2, produced in injured dorsal root ganglia
(DRG) neurons, may enhance neuronal transmission
and produce neuropathic pain via triggering microglia
activation and phosphorylating NR1 and NR2B in
neurons in spinal cord [18]. Acute morphine induced a
significant up-regulation of MMP-9 in primary sensory
neurons expressing MOR in DRGs, masking morphineinduced analgesia through MMP-9-dependent activation
of satellite glial cells (SGCs) and increase in IL-1β
[19, 20]. The evidence mentioned above suggested that
MMP-9 and MMP-2 may be involved in opioids-mediated
nociception. However, it is unclear whether MMP-9 and
MMP-2 also contribute to RIH.
In the present study, we examined the activity of MMP9 and MMP-2 in spinal cord and in DRGs after subcutaneous
infusion of remifentanil in a rat model of incisional pain, and
further investigated the underlying mechanisms and sought
a safe treatment for RIH using N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC).
NAC, an ‘old’, safe and commonly used clinically medicine
[21], is a donor of cysteine and prevents the cysteine residue
on MMP-9 and MMP-2 from being oxidized, which is vital
to MMPs activation [22, 23]. Considering its safety and
potential ability to interfere with the vital process of the
‘cysteine switch’ during MMPs activation, we chose NAC
to target MMP-9 and MMP-2.

The activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 after surgery in
spinal cord and DRGs was evaluated using Colorimetric
quantitative detection. The results revealed an increase
in MMP-9 activity in the DRGs at 24 h and 48 h after
subcutaneous remifentanil infusion during surgery in group
R as compared with group I (P < 0.0001). While the other
gelatinase MMP-2, a close family member of MMP-9,
did not change significantly after surgery, indicating a
unique role of MMP-9 in RIH (Figure 1C, 1D). Notably,
no significant change in the activity of MMP-9 or MMP-2
in the lumber spinal cord was observed after intraoperative
remifentanil infusion (Figure 1E, 1F). Results of western
blotting suggested that the expression of MMP-9 also upregulated in DRGs in group R (P < 0.0001) (Figure 1G–1I).

Intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced
MMP-9 in MOR-expressing DRG neurons
Double immunofluorescence staining showed that
MMP-9 was expressed in 20.36% and 29.20% DRG
neurons in control rats and incisional rats at 24 h after
surgery respectively, and the percentage was significantly
increased in group R at 24 h and 48 h after subcutaneous
remifentanil infusion during surgery (P < 0.0001)
(Figure  2A, 2B). The fluorescence intensity of MMP-9
was up-regulated in DRGs in group R (P < 0.0001), in
support of the Western blotting results. However, the
expression of MOR per se did not change in group I or
group R after surgery (Figure 2B, 2C). Further analysis
demonstrated that the percentage of MOR-positive DRG
neurons expressing MMP-9 increased from 45.92%
in group I to 69.44% in group R at 24 h after surgery
(P < 0.0001) (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced
postoperative hyperalgesia and increased
MMP-9 activity in DRGs

At 24 h after incisional surgery, the PWMT and
PWTL were decreased by 14.09 ± 1.32 g and 12.74 ± 1.29
s in group I, by 7.24 ± 1.56 g and 7.25 ± 1.18 s in group R.
Single doses of NAC (25 mg/kg, 75 mg/ kg, 150 mg/ kg)
were administrated intraperitoneally to rats after the
mechanical threshold and thermal latency tests. NAC
(150 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated pain behaviors
in group I (PWMT: P = 0.002 at 0.5 h, P < 0.0001 at 2 h,
P = 0.00047 at 4 h, P = 0.159 at 8 h; PWTL: P < 0.0001
at 0.5 h, 2 h and 4 h, P = 0.00023 at 8 h) and group R
(PWMT: P < 0.0001 at 0.5 h, 2 h and 4 h, P = 0.011 at
8 h; PWTL: P < 0.0001 at 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h and 8 h), but
exerted no influence on PWMT or PWTL of control
rats (Figure 3A, 3B). Moreover, NAC dose-dependently
reduced the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia
induced by intraoperative remifentanil infusion. Compared
with group R+Veh, PWMT and PWTL in group R+NAC

There was no significant difference in the baseline of
PWMT and PWTL among groups before surgery. Compared
with the baseline, the administration of sevoflurane and the
subcutaneous infusion of saline for a period of 30 min to
rats in the absence of plantar incision in group C did not
produce significant changes in PWTL or PWMT. However,
compared with baseline and group C, the plantar incision
evoked a decrease in PWMT and PWTL in the operated hind
paw after surgery at all time points observed (P < 0.0001).
Intraoperative infusion of remifentanil significantly
enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia
induced by the plantar incision. This was manifested by
a significant decrease in PWMT (P < 0.0001) and PWTL
(P < 0.0001 at 2 h, 24 h and 48 h, P = 0.00014 at 6 h) in
group R compared with rats in group I (Figure 1A, 1B).

activity was changed in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn at 24 h and 48 h after surgery (n = 5). (G–I) Western blotting showed that the
expression of MMP-9 was up-regulated in ipsilateral lumbar DRGs at 24 h and 48 h after intraoperative remifentanil infusion, and MMP2 remained unchanged. Representative bands for MMP-9, MMP-2 and β-actin resulted in products of 92/84, 72, 43 kDa (G) and data

Significant difference in pain behaviors was revealed after Repeated measures ANOVA, and significant difference in the results of western

compared with group I, #P < 0.05 compared with baseline, Bonferroni post hoc tests).

(150 mg/kg) began to increase at 0.5 h after administration
and this increase peaked at 2 h, decreased within 8 h
(Figure 3C, 3D). Moreover, NAC (150 mg/kg, i.p.)
significantly inhibited the activities of MMP-9 (P = 0.042
in control rats, P = 0.00013 in incisional rats, P < 0.0001
in remifentanil-treated incisional rats) and MMP-2
(P = 0.00055 in control rats, P = 0.00363 in incisional
rats, P = 0.00014 in remifentanil-treated incisional rats)
at 2 h after injection in the DRGs of rats from all groups
(Figure 3E, 3F).

here effects of NAC on the phosphorylation levels of
MAPKs in ipsilateral lumber spinal cord dorsal horn at 2
h after injection were detected. NAC (150 mg/kg) reduced
the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
extracellular regulating kinase (ERK) and p38 induced
by intraoperative remifentanil infusion (P < 0.0001)
(Figure 5A–5D).
Spinal glial activation, which may be triggered by
MMP-9 produced in DRGs [17], is essential dynamic
regulators of neuronal network and inflammation in RIH
[7]. Results of immunofluorescence indicated that single
injection of NAC inhibited the up-regulation of glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, marker for astrocyte)
and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1,
marker for microglia) in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn
after intraoperative remifentanil infusion (P < 0.0001)
(Figure 5E–5H).

NAC inhibited remifentanil-induced IL-1β
up-regulation via MMP-9 in DRGs
IL-1β, a critical substrate of MMP-9, is essential
for the generation and maintenance of hyperalgesia.
Previous study suggested that MMP-9 is required for the
acute morphine-induced IL-1β activation in DRGs [19].
Immunofluorescence staining was applied to test whether
remifentanil infusion would induce mature active IL-1β
(17 kDa) expression via MMP-9 and the effects of NAC
in DRGs. Low level of IL-1β expression was observed
in DRGs of control rats. The fluorescence intensity of
IL-1β was increased significantly in incisional rats with
intraoperative remifentanil infusion (P < 0.0001). Notably,
this increase was alleviated significantly at 2 h after
intraperitoneal injection of NAC in incisional rats with
or without remifentanil infusion (P = 0.011 in incisional
rats, P < 0.0001 in remifentanil-treated incisional rats).
However, NAC did not alter the expression of IL-1β in
control rats. Staining for DAPI (nuclear marker) in DRGs
indicated the localization of SGCs, while no staining
indicated neurons in DRGs. The cellular localization of
IL-1β was found in cytoplasm of both SGCs and neurons
of remifentanil-infused rats (Figure 4A, 4B).

NAC inhibited remifentanil-induced
PKCγ phosphorylation and NR1, NR2B
phosphorylation in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal
horn
Sensitization of nociceptive pathways has been
considered mainly a neurocentric plastic mechanism in
spinal dorsal horn. The phosphorylation and activation of
NMDAR in spinal neurons enhanced sensory responses
in RIH [4]. Effects of NAC on the neuronal activation
induced by remifentanil in ipsilateral lumber spinal cord
dorsal horn at 2 h after injection were also detected.
Results of western blotting showed that NAC dramatically
decreased the remifentanil-induced phosphorylation of
PKCγ, NR1 and NR2B (P < 0.0001) (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION

NAC inhibited remifentanil-induced spinal
MAPK family phosphorylation and glial
activation in ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn

The major findings of the present study were as
follows: (1) intraoperative remifentanil infusion induced
MMP-9 up-regulation and activation in primary sensory
neurons expressing MOR in DRGs, but not in spinal cord;
(2) single intraperitoneal injection of NAC attenuated
remifentanil-induced postoperative mechanical allodynia
and thermal hyperalgesia via suppressing remifentanilinduced activation of MMP-9 in DRGs of incisional rats;
(3) NAC also inhibited remifentanil-induced cleavage
of IL-1β in DRGs; (4) NAC significantly inhibited

IL-1β produced and cleaved in DRGs may elicit
hypersensitivity in spinal dorsal horn via causing
hyperexcitability of primary sensory neurons by increasing
sodium currents and suppressing potassium currents
[24–26]. The activation (phosphorylation) of MAPK family
in spinal cord contributes to the central hypersensitivity,

remifentanil-induced glial activation and phosphorylation
of MAPK family, PKCγ, NR1 and NR2B in ipsilateral
spinal cord dorsal horn. Based on these findings, we
postulate that up-regulation and activation of neuronal
MMP-9, and subsequent IL-1β cleavage in DRGs
following intraoperative remifentanil infusion triggers
glial activation and sensory neuron excitability in spinal
cord dorsal horn, promoting the development of RIH.

The gelatinase MMP-9 appears to result in opioidelicited paradoxical pro-nociceptive effects. Recent
studies indicated that up-regulation and activation of
MMP-9 in spinal cord was implicated in the physical
dependence on chronic morphine through possible
neuronal activation and interaction with NR1 and NR2B
[27]. Repeated morphine treatment-induced tolerance was
associated with a persistent MMP-9 activation after the

transient increment in MMP-9 expression in midbrain
[28]. Acute subcutaneous morphine induced a significant
up-regulation of MMP-9 in MOR-positive neurons in
DRGs [20], sabotaging morphine-induced analgesia via
MMP-9-triggered peripheral neuronal-glial interactions,
specifically, MMP-9-dependent activation of satellite
glial cells and cleavage of IL-1β [19]. Moreover, MMP-9
also mediated neuropathic pain via degenerative and proinflammatory mechanisms. Nerve injury induced an early
rapid increase of active MMP-9 in DRGs by 24 h [29], and
in spinal cord by 14 d [18]. Active MMP-2 in DRGs and
in spinal cord was delayed until 7 d and persisted through
21 d [18]. The different time pattern suggested distinct
roles of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the development and
maintenance of pain. Our results indicated that an increase
in MMP-9 activity and expression in DRGs following
intraoperative remifentanil infusion was correlated with
remifentanil-evoked pro-nociceptive actions. However, no
increase in MMP-2 activity after remifentanil infusion was

observed, in support of previous studies that MMP-2 was
not involved in early-phase development of hyperalgesia.
Recent evidence suggested that subcutaneous
morphine increased MMP-9 expression and activity in
DRGs, and this effect was inhibited by opioid receptor
antagonist naloxone and the selective MOR antagonist
CTAP [20]. Activation of MAPKs pathways following
morphine treatment may contribute to the MORdependent MMP-9 expression in DRG neurons [30]. Our
immunofluorescence results showed that intraoperative
remifentanil infusion-induced MMP-9 increase was
enriched in MOR-positive DRG neurons, also supported
a MOR-dependent mechanism of MMP-9 induction in
DRGs.
These results indicated that MMP-9 may be a
vital target in the therapeutic intervention of RIH which
occurs mainly in the early-phase after intraoperative
remifentanil infusion. Previous reports suggested that
gene knockout of MMP-9 or administration of inhibitors

for general or specific inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-2
reduced nociceptive pain behaviors induced by peripheral
nerve injury [17, 31]. However, considering that the
normal physiological effects of MMPs are very essential
[32], MMP-9 gene knockout may exhibit various adverse
effects, and inhibitors of MMPs in animal researches have
not been applied to clinical use. A recent study used NAC, a
compound with abundant cysteine residues, with negligible
adverse effects and low cost, to target the ‘cysteine switch’
of MMPs, and demonstrated that NAC significantly
reduced the activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 with inhibition
efficiencies of 86.3% and 70.8% in vitro, 62.0% and 47.3%
in vivo respectively, subsequently attenuated chronic
constrictive injury-induced mechanical allodynia and
thermal hyperalgesia [18]. Therefore, we used NAC, an
effective drug with excellent clinical safety history, which
was injected intraperitoneally, to inhibit the activity of
MMP-9 in DRGs. In accordance with the Colorimetric
quantitative detection results that NAC significantly reduced
intraoperative remifentanil-induced activation of MMP-9
in DRGs, behavioral tests revealed that NAC effectively
attenuated remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia.
MMP-9 has been proven to cleave IL-1β, which is
one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines

in nervous system and promotes the development of
opioid-induced tolerance and hyperalgesia [33]. Our data
demonstrated that intraoperative remifentanil infusion
induced the up-regulation of mature active IL-1β in both
DRG neurons and SGCs, and NAC decreased remifentanilinduced IL-1β activation via inhibiting MMP-9. It was
suggested that the cleavage of IL-1β required MMP-9
which was released from DRG neurons expressing MOR
following remifentanil infusion, retained in extracellular
space between neurons and SGCs, and mediated neuronalglial interactions. Similarly, previous studies showed that
intrathecal injection with MMP-9 caused IL-1β cleavage in
DRGs accompanied by significant allodynia [17]. Primary
sensory neurons particularly nociceptors in DRGs express
IL-1 receptors (IL-1R), and activation of IL-1R by IL-1β
can activate nociceptors rapidly to generate action potentials
and elicit pain hypersensitivity via regulating sodium
and potassium currents [25, 26]. Since the acute opioidinduced increase in IL-1β occurred primarily in DRGs,
down-regulation of IL-1β in DRGs using selective siRNA
potentiated and prolonged morphine-induced analgesia [19].
Furthermore, MMP-9 and MMP-2 produced in
DRG neurons may trigger the activation of microglia
and astrocytes in spinal dorsal horn co-localized with

phosphorylated MAPKs and contribute to neuropathic
pain through increasing IL-1β cleavage [17]. Inhibiting
IL-1β signaling with a neutralizing antibody or antagonist
prevented the hyperalgesia [17, 34, 35], establishing that
IL-1β as a downstream regulator of MMP-9 mediated the
nociceptive information from DRGs to spinal cord. The
phosphorylation of MAPK family and the activation of
glial cells in spinal dorsal horn induced by intraoperative
remifentanil infusion can result in the production and
release of multiple inflammatory mediators, and produce
RIH [7, 36–38]. In addition to glia, the phosphorylation
and activation of NMDAR in spinal neurons also resulted
in the synaptic plasticity and enhanced sensory responses
after intraoperative remifentanil infusion [4, 39–41]. The
present study found that NAC can effectively decrease the
phosphorylation of NR1, NR2B and MAPK family, decrease
sensory neuron excitability and inhibit glial activation in
spinal dorsal horn caused by remifentanil infusion.
In addition to the direct inhibition of the activation of
MMP-9 in DRGs as revealed by Colorimetric quantitative
detection in this study, previous studies indicated that NAC
may alleviate neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain
through reducing nitric oxide metabolites [42], scavenging
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [43], and enhancing
endogenous activation of type-2 metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluR) in spinal cord [44]. The gelatin lytic
activity and expression of MMP-9 could also be abolished
indirectly by NAC via its ROS scavenging effect [45].
Moreover, inhibition of mGluR2/3 or system Xc- could
only mildly suppress NAC’s inhibition of MMP-9 activity
and partly reduce NAC’s inhibition of mechanical allodynia
in a rat model of neuropathic pain [18]. Therefore, MMP-9
may be a more vital target of NAC in the treatment of pain.
In conclusion, intraoperative remifentanil infusion
elicited MMP-9 activation and up-regulation in primary
sensory neurons and subsequently caused IL-1β cleavage
in DRGs, leading to the central sensitization in spinal
cord to induce postoperative hyperalgesia. The safe drug
NAC, which was effective in inhibiting MMP-9 activity,
significantly attenuated RIH. These findings may represent
a bright prospect for the treatment of RIH.

were made to minimize rats suffering. The sample size

number of rats necessary to obtain valid results.

Drug preparation
Remifentanil hydrochloride (RenFu Co., Yichang,
China) and NAC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were dissolved
in 0.9% saline solution, respectively. Remifentanil
(0.04 mg/ kg, 0.4 ml) was infused subcutaneously during
surgical incision over a period of 30 min using an apparatus
pump. The infusion rate was 0.8 ml/h. Rats in group C and
group I received the same volume of saline in identical
conditions. Single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of
NAC (25 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg) in a volume of 1 ml
was performed at 24 h after plantar incision. The dosages
of NAC were chosen referring to the previous study [18]
and our preliminary experiments. For vehicle treatment, a
same volume of 0.9% saline was intraperitoneally injected.

Incisional surgery
Rats in group I and group R were anesthetized with
sevoflurane (induction, 3%, surgery, 1%; Heng Rui Co.,
Shanghai, China) via a nose mask. The right hindpaw was
placed through a hole in a sterile drape, and the plantar aspect
was sterilized with 5% povidone-iodine solution. A longitudinal
1-cm incision was made through the skin and fascia, starting at
0.5 cm from the edge of the heel and extending toward the toes
of the right hindpaw. The plantar muscle was elevated using
forceps and incised longitudinally, leaving the muscle origin
and insertion intact. After hemostasis with gentle pressure,
the skin was closed with two mattress sutures of 5–0 nylon.
The wound site was covered with Aureomycin ointment.
Control rats underwent a sham procedure that consisted of
administration of sevoflurane and subcutaneous infusion of
the same volume of saline without incision [46].

Pain behavioral assessment
Pain behavioral tests were performed at 24 h before
surgery (baseline), 2 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h after surgery, and before
NAC administration (24 h after surgery), 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h
after NAC administration (n = 8 rats per group). All tests were
performed during the light phase. Before each test, rats were
allowed to acclimatize for at least 30 min. All experiments
were performed by the same investigators in a quiet test room.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing
220–250 g, were provided by the Laboratory Animal
Center of Drum Tower Hospital. Rats were housed
in climate-controlled rooms (22 ± 2°C) on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle and with free access to food and water.
Rats were acclimatized for 1 week before experimental
procedures. All experimental procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
in Nanjing University and were in accordance with the
ethical guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. Efforts

Paw withdrawal mechanical threshold (PWMT)
Mechanical allodynia was assessed using a Dynamic
Plantar Analgesiometer (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy). Each
rat was placed into individual transparent plexiglass
compartments (20 cm × 25 cm × 15 cm) onto a metal mesh
floor (graticule: 1 cm × 1 cm). A metal wire was pressed
vertically against the central plantar surface and the force

as paw flinching or withdrawal of the hindpaw. The test
was repeated five times with a 5-min interval between
each application of force.

anti-p-ERK1 (pT202/pY204)+ERK2 (pT185/pY187)
(1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-pJNK1+JNK2 (pT183+pY185, 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK), rabbit anti-p-p38 (phospho Y182, 1:1000, Abcam,

1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-p-NR1
(phospho S896, 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
rabbit anti-p-NR2B (phospho Y1472, 1:1000, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), and rabbit anti-β-actin antibody
(1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The
membranes were washed with TBST buffer for 1 h and
incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (1:10000, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) for 2 h at room temperature and visualized in ECL
solution followed by film exposure for 1–10 min. β-actin
was used as a loading control for total protein. The density
of specific bands was measured using an analysis system
(Quantity One V4.31, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL)
Thermal hyperalgesia to radiant heat was determined
using an automatic Plantar Test (Hargreaves Apparatus,
Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) according to a previous
method [47]. Rats were placed into individual transparent
plexiglass compartments on a clear elevated glass floor.
The movable heat stimulator was moved to focus onto the
central plantar surface of the hindpaw through the glass
plate. The nociceptive end points in the radiant heat test
were the characteristic lifting or licking of the hindpaw, and
the time to the end point was considered PWTL. A cutoff
time of 25 seconds as used to avoid tissue damage. There
were 5 trials per rat and 5-minute intervals between trials.

Immunofluorescence

Colorimetric quantitative detection of MMP-2/9
activity

Rats were deeply anaesthetized with sevoflurane and
perfused through the ascending aorta with physiological
saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer at pH 7.2-7.4, 4°C. After perfusion, the
L4-L5 right DRGs and lumbar spinal cord segments were
removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 6 h and
then dehydrated in 30% sucrose (n = 5 rats per group).
Sections (20 μm) were cut in a freezing microtome. After
washed in PBS, the DRG and spinal cord sections were
blocked with 100% (v/v) goat serum or 50% (v/v) donkey
serum with 0.3% Triton X-100 respectively for 2 h at room
temperature. Some DRG sections were incubated over two
nights at 4°C with a mixture of primary antibodies in 10%
goat serum: rabbit anti-MOR (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and mouse anti-MMP-9 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). Other DRG sections were incubated over two nights
at 4°C with primary antibodies in 10% goat serum: rabbit
anti-IL-1β (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The spinal
cord sections were incubated over two nights at 4°C
with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-GFAP
(1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in 10%
goat serum and goat anti-Iba1 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) in 10% donkey serum, respectively. After washed in
PBS, the DRG sections were incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with a mixture of secondary antibodies in 10%
goat serum: FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor
594, 1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The spinal cord
sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature
with secondary antibodies respectively: goat anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594, 1:500, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 555, 1:1500, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA).
DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma, St. Louis,

Rats were anesthetized deeply with 5% sevoflurane,
the L4-L5 right DRGs and right spinal cord dorsal horn
segments were removed rapidly and stored in liquid
nitrogen (n = 5 rats per group). The activity of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 was determined using Colorimetric quantitative
detection kits (Genmed Scientifics, MA, USA) according
to the manufacture’s protocol. Briefly, protein samples
were ground in liquid nitrogen, incubated in lysis buffer
on ice, centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min at 4°C and the
supernatant was obtained. The protein concentration was
determined using the BCA method. 100 μg of protein
was added to the reaction buffer in a cuvette. Then, the
substrate was added. The absorption at 412 nm was
measured using a spectrophotometer during a period of
15 min. The fold-increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity
was determined by comparing the results of treated
samples with the level of untreated control.

Western blotting
The right DRGs and right dorsal horn of spinal
cord segments were removed rapidly and stored in liquid
nitrogen under deep anesthesia (n = 5 rats per group).
Tissue samples were homogenized in ice-cold lysis
buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13000 rpm
for 10 min at 4°C and supernatant was obtained. Protein
lysates (50 µg) and protein molecular weight marker
were separated using SDS-PAGE (10%) for 90 min at
120 V, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore Corporation, MA, USA) at
200 mA for 2 h. After blocked in skim milk for 2 h at
room temperature, the membranes were incubated with
the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, including mouse
anti-MMP-9 (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse

Statistical analysis

REFERENCES

Data were expressed as the mean ± SD. SPSS
15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to conduct all
the statistical analyses. Rats were assigned to different
treatment groups in a randomized manner. Multiple
comparisons were carried out to determine the overall
differences of pain behaviors at each time point and repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to
assess the changes of pain behaviors over time. One-way
ANOVA was used to determine differences in the results
of Colorimetric quantitative detection of MMP-2/9 activity,
western blotting and immunofluorescence among groups.
In both cases, when significant main effects were observed,
Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted to determine the
source(s) of these differences. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
