Abstract
Autophagy is a protective mechanism that renders cells viable in stressful conditions. Emerging evidence
suggests that this cellular process is also a tumor suppressor pathway. Previous studies showed that cyclindependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) induce autophagy. Whether retinoblastoma protein (RB), a key tumor
suppressor and downstream target of CDKIs, induces autophagy is not clear. Here, we show that RB triggers
autophagy and that the RB activators p16INK4a and p27/kip1 induce autophagy in an RB-dependent manner. RB binding to E2 transcription factor (E2F) is required for autophagy induction and E2F1 antagonizes
RB-induced autophagy, leading to apoptosis. Downregulation of E2F1 in cells results in high levels of
autophagy. Our findings indicate that RB induces autophagy by repressing E2F1 activity. We speculate that
this newly discovered aspect of RB function is relevant to cancer development and therapy. Cancer Res; 70(20);

Introduction
Autophagy is a cellular process that engulfs organelles and
cytoplasmic contents to digest and recycle these materials to
sustain cellular metabolism (1). In addition to providing a basic catabolic function, autophagy is also used by the cell to
cope with stressful conditions to improve survival (2). Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy is a tumor suppressor
pathway (2, 3), although the detailed mechanisms governing
this pathway are largely unknown. Indeed, several tumor
suppressor proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and p53 (2), induce autophagy. Conversely,
multiple oncogenes, including Bcl-2 and the AKT/target of
rapamycin (TOR) pathway, inhibit autophagy (2). Of particular importance, the inactivation of several key autophagy regulators, such as Beclin 1 and ATG4, results in spontaneous
tumors (4) or increases the formation of tumors by carcinogens in mice (5).
Retinoblastoma protein (RB) is considered the prototype of
tumor suppressor proteins, and as such, inactivation of RB is
found in an ample array of cancers (6). In tumors with wildtype RB gene, RB is frequently inactivated by the abnormal
expression of activators, such as the p16INK4a (p16) protein,
and repressors, including cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent

kinase-4 (6). Interestingly, loss of RB in cancer cells leads
to increased sensitivity to therapy (7–9) and activation of
RB through transfer of p16 increases chemoresistance
(10). The mechanisms underlying this RB-mediated resistance are not completely understood. Recently, autophagy
has been connected to resistance to cancer therapy (2).
On the basis of previous studies in which cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (CDKI), activators of RB, were shown to
induce autophagy (11, 12), we hypothesized that RB, a key
tumor suppressor and downstream target of CDKIs, induces
autophagy.
Moreover, the physical interaction between RB and E2
transcription factor 1 (E2F1) is perhaps the best-understood
mechanism of how RB functions. These two proteins play opposite roles in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis.
RB promotes growth arrest, whereas E2F1 positively regulates the transition from the G1 to the S phase (13); RB protects from apoptosis (7), whereas E2F1 induces apoptosis
(14). Thus, we asked whether RB and E2F1 also play antagonistic roles in the regulation of autophagy.
In this study, we examined the role of RB/E2F1 in the regulation of autophagy. Our data indicate that RB induces
autophagy by repressing E2F1 activity, and E2F1 antagonizes
RB activity to prevent autophagy.

established from acute cell dissociation of surgical specimens
of human glioblastoma multiforme and maintained in
DMEM/F-12 supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), epidermal
growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/mL
each; Sigma-Aldrich) according to procedures described
elsewhere (15).
Reagents and antibodies
Acridine orange was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit
polyclonal p16 (N-20), rabbit polyclonal E2F1 (C-20), and goat
polyclonal actin (I-19) antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal Bcl-2, light chain 3B
(LC3B), and Beclin 1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal RB was obtained from
Abcam, and monoclonal anti–α-tubulin (B-5-1-2) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Adenoviruses
To construct recombinant adenoviruses expressing RB
mutants, we made the Δ22 deletion (amino acids 738–775;
ref. 16) and R661W mutation (17) required for E2F binding.
The site-directed mutagenesis for the deletion and mutation
was conducted with the use of the QuikChange II XL sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in pXCJL-RB, a shuttle
vector that includes the expression cassette for wild-type RB
driven by human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (18). We
confirmed the mutations in RB cDNA and the fidelity of the
mutagenesis reaction by sequencing the whole RB cDNA region in the resultant pXCJL-RBΔ22 and pXCJL-RB R661W
plasmids. We then cotransfected the pXCJL-RBΔ22 or
pXCJL-RB R661W plasmid with pBHG10 (Microbix Biosystems, Inc.) into 293 cells to generate an AdCMV-RBΔ22 or
AdCMV-RB R661W adenovirus. The recombinant adenoviruses were prepared as previously described (19). Briefly,
the viruses were amplified in 293 cells, purified by three successive bandings on cesium, and stored at −80°C. The viral
titer was assayed by the tissue culture infection dose 50
(TCID50) and determined as plaque-forming units (pfu) per
milliliter, according to the validated method developed by
Quantum Biotechnology. Other recombinant adenoviruses
used in the study included AdCMV-RB (18), AdRSV-p16
(18), AdCMV, AdCMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP),
AdCMV-E2F1 (20), AdMH4p27 (11), and AdCMV-β-gal (all
prepared by the Keck Institutional Vector Core at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
The cells were suspended and lysed in ice-cold PBS plus
1% NP40 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich).
For each sample, 2 μg of anti-E2F1 antibody and 40 μL of
protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) were
added to 500 μg of cell lysate proteins. After 2 hours of immunoprecipitation at 4°C, the beads were pelleted and
washed. The precipitated proteins or cell lysate proteins
were dissolved in 1× SDS loading buffer, separated by
SDS-PAGE, and probed with antibodies. Finally, the protein
bands were visualized with the ECL Western blot detection
system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Subcellular localization of light chain-3 fusion proteins
Saos-2 and U-87 MG cells were transfected with enhanced
green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 (EGFP-LC3; a kind gift
from Dr. S. Kondo, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center) or mRFP-EGFP-LC3 (Addgene; ref. 21) fusion
protein–expressing plasmid by FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals). The cells were then screened with G418
(800 μg/mL for Saos-2, 700 μg/mL for U-87 MG). Positive
clones were selected and maintained in culture medium plus
G418. The cells expressing EGFP-LC3 were first fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C. Saos2-mRFP-EGFP-LC3 cells were observed alive. Images were
taken and processed on a Zeiss Axiovert Zoom fluorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with an AxioCam
MRM camera and a 40×/1.3 oil EC Plan-NEOFLUAR objective, using Immersol (n = 1.518) at room temperature. The
acquisition software was AxioVision Release 4.7.1 (Carl
Zeiss). Images were processed by Photoshop (Adobe) with
the use of proportional adjustments. We counted 150 to
200 cells from three independent experiments for quantitative analysis.
Electron microscopy
Samples were fixed with a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 hour. After fixation, the samples were
washed and treated with 0.1% Millipore-filtered cacodylatebuffered tannic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), postfixed for 1 hour
with 1% buffered osmium tetroxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and then
stained with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate (SigmaAldrich). The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated, and then embedded in Spurr's
low-viscosity medium. The samples were polymerized in an
oven for 2 days at 70°C. Ultrathin sections were cut in a Leica
Ultracut microtome (Leica), stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate in a Leica EM stainer, and examined by using a
JEM-1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA,
Inc.) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were
obtained with the use of an imaging system from Advanced
Microscopy Techniques.
RNA interference
The siRNA for Beclin 1 depletion was obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. We purchased custom and control
siRNAs from Dharmacon, Inc. The E2F1 siRNA (siE2F1)
sequence was as follows: 5′-GGCCCGAUCGAUGUUUUCCUU-3′ (22). The cells were mock or siRNA transfected with
INTERFERin (Polyplus-transfection, Inc.) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. To knock down RB expression in
U-87 MG cells, we transfected the cells with shGFP- or
shRB-expressing plasmids (23) by FuGENE 6. The cells were
screened, and stable cell clones were maintained in culture
medium plus 0.5 μg/mL puromycin.
Autophagy PCR array
Total RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The RNA samples were then treated with
TURBO DNA-free kit to remove any DNA contamination

RB/E2F1 Pathway Regulates Autophagy

Results
RB induces autophagic responses in RB-deficient cells
To test our hypothesis that RB induces autophagy, we first
transduced RB into the following RB-defective human cancer
cells: sarcoma osteogenic cells (Saos-2), hepatoma cells
(Hep3B), and brain tumor stem cells (MDNSC23; ref. 15).
The exogenous RB protein induced autophagy in all three cell

lines (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). Specifically, we examined whether the transfer of RB induced the conversion of
the microtubule-associated protein LC3-I to LC3-II, a
biochemical marker of autophagy that is correlated with
the formation of autophagosomes. Immunoblotting analyses
revealed an accumulation of LC3-II in the cells treated with
RB, but not in the mock-treated or GFP-treated cells
(Fig. 1A). Consistently, RB also triggered the formation of

autophagosomes/autolysosomes visualized by punctate
EGFP-LC3 in Saos-2 cells that constitutively express the fusion protein (Fig. 1B). In more than 80% of the RB-treated
cells, EGFP-LC3 was not soluble and presented green fluorescent dots, whereas less than 20% of the control cells displayed the same pattern (Fig. 1B). Ultimately, these data
were confirmed by an ultrastructural study of the cells with
a transmission electron microscope, which revealed accumulation of membrane-rimmed vacuoles with characteristics of
autophagosomes/autolysosomes in Saos-2 (Fig. 1C) and
Hep3B (Supplementary Fig. S1) cells after RB expression.
We then challenged the autophagy mechanism by downmodulating Beclin 1, a key activator of the pathway. As
expected, silencing Beclin 1 in Saos-2 cells with siRNA
decreased the RB-mediated processing of the formation of
autophagosomes/autolysosomes and membrane-bound
LC3-II (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2). In agreement with

7886

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

these results was our observation that RB expression in
Saos-2 cells, in a PCR-based array, stimulated the expression
of several autophagy-related genes (Supplementary Fig. S3),
such as ATG4A and ATG7. However, Bcl-2, which inhibits
the autophagy process and whose gene is a well-studied transcriptional target of E2F1 (25, 26), was down-modulated
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Overall, our data indicate that RB
restoration in RB-deficient cells triggers autophagy.
RB promotes autophagosome formation
and maturation
The accumulation of autophagosomes and LC3-II in the
cells could be due to either the increased formation or the
decreased turnover of vesicles. To determine how RB affects
the autophagy flux, we took advantage of the double-tagged
mRFP-EGFP-LC3 construct (ptfLC3; ref. 21), which is
detected as yellow fluorescence (green merged with red) in

nonacidic structures (autophagosomes and amphisomes)
and as red only in autolysosomes due to the quenching of
EGFP in these acidic structures. As shown in Fig. 2, more
than 70% of the RB-transduced cells displayed tremendous
red fluorescence punctation, whereas only less than 10% of
the mock- or AdCMV-treated cells showed this phenotype.
However, when the cells were treated with bafilomycin A1
(which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes) to stop the turnover of autophagosomes, different
from the cells transduced with RB, we found an extraordinary amount of punctate yellow fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that RB increases the
transport of mRFP-EGFP-LC3 to acidic lysosomes (i.e., formation of autolysosomes). Moreover, electron microscopic

examination of the cells revealed that bafilomycin A1 caused
the accumulation of vacuoles in RB-expressing cells that
filled most of the space in the cytoplasm, whereas the
vacuoles in mock or GFP-expressing cells occupied less than
half of the space in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S4),
indicating that RB stimulated a higher rate of autophagosome formation. Taken together with the previous observations, we conclude that RB mediates the initiation and
maturation of autophagosomes instead of inhibiting the
fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes.
CDKIs cause autophagy in an RB-dependent manner
Because RB activity is positively regulated by CDKIs, such as
p16 and p27/kip1 (p27), we asked whether activation of the RB

pathway by CDKIs would result in autophagy in these cells. To
this end, we transferred p16 to glioblastoma-astrocytoma
(U-87 MG) and human osteosarcoma (U-2 OS) cell lines that
express wild-type RB. The ectopic p16 protein triggered the
lipidation of LC3, resulting in an increase of LC3-II in both cell
lines (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, more than 60% of the U-87-EGFPLC3 cells showed a marked punctate pattern of green fluorescence after transduction of p16, whereas less than 20% of the
control cells showed a similar pattern (Fig. 3B). Moreover,
when we transferred p16 to U-87-shRB cells, in which RB
expression had been knocked down by shRNA against RB
(Fig. 3C), we observed that down-modulation of RB prevented
the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, indicating that it rendered
U-87 MG cells resistant to p16-mediated autophagy (Fig. 3C).
In addition to p16, the best-documented CDKI that is involved in the positive regulation of autophagy is p27 (11,
12). Unlike p16, p27 has other targets in addition to RB
(27–29). When we transferred p27 to U-2 OS and Saos-2

7888

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

cells, U-2 OS cells were much more sensitive to p27 in a
dose-dependent manner, resulting in a conversion of LC3-I
to LC3-II that was not observed in Saos-2 cells (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that RB might be one of the factors involved
in p27-mediated autophagy.
Collectively, these data indicate that RB expression is
required for p16-mediated autophagy and that RB could be
one of the downstream targets involved in p27-induced
autophagy. These data therefore reinforce the role of the
RB pathway in autophagy regulation.
Binding to E2F is required for RB to trigger autophagy
The best-known mechanistic model of RB indicates the
physical binding and repression of E2F transcription factors,
including E2F1 (30). Thus, we speculated whether RB mutants
that are deficient for E2F binding would lose the capability
to induce autophagy. We selected two RB mutants naturally found in cancer cells that are deficient in binding E2F.

RB/E2F1 Pathway Regulates Autophagy

Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that both RB mutants Δ22 (16) and R661W (17) displayed impaired ability
in binding E2F1 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the two RB mutants
were deficient in blocking the transactivation of the E2F1
responsible element, as quantified by luciferase assays
(Fig. 4B). Then, we examined autophagy occurrence in
Saos-2 cells transduced with the two mutants. We found
that the expression of Δ22 or R661W resulted in EGFPLC3 punctation in less than 20% of the cells, whereas
wild-type RB induced green fluorescence dots in more than
80% of the cells (Fig. 4C). Consistently, neither Δ22 nor
R661W induced significant LC3-I to LC3-II conversion,
according to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4D). Therefore, RB
mutants with impaired binding to E2F are deficient for
autophagy induction, indicating that RB binding to E2F is
required for RB-induced autophagy.
E2F1 antagonizes RB-mediated autophagy
RB and E2F1 exert contrary functions in the regulation of
the cell cycle and apoptosis (7, 13). We previously reported
that expression of ectopic E2F1 overrides the cell cycle arrest
induced by RB (20). In this study, we were interested in ascertaining whether the expression of E2F1 would be sufficient to antagonize RB-mediated autophagy. Thus, we
transferred RB and then E2F1 into Saos-2 cells 24 hours later.
Examination of the cells 48 hours after the transfer of E2F1
revealed that E2F1 was able to partially override RB function
and prevent the formation of the green-dot phenotype and
the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 5A and B). These studies showed a progressive decrease in the percentage of cells

with punctate green fluorescence: from almost 100% in cells
treated with RB, to 40% in cells treated with both RB and
E2F1, to less than 20% in cells treated with E2F1 alone
(Fig. 5A). Consistently, Bcl-2 protein, an autophagy inhibitor,
was downregulated by RB but was upregulated by E2F1
(Fig. 5B).
Because expression of E2F1 induces apoptosis (20), we
asked whether the cells that were transduced by E2F1 were
undergoing cell death through apoptosis. Optical microscopy
showed that although RB-transduced cells displayed a flat
morphology and remained attached to the culture dish, some
of the cells transduced with both RB and E2F1 became rounded, birefringent, and detached from the dish (data not shown),
strongly suggesting decreased viability of the culture. To determine whether the cause of the cell death was apoptosis, we
used flow cytometry to examine the ability of the cells to bind
to Annexin V, a reagent to detect the translocation of the
membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the inner
to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane—one of the
earliest indications of apoptosis. Although the percentage of
autophagic cells was less than 10% in E2F1-treated cells
(Fig. 5A), the treatment caused about 40% of the cells to
undergo apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conclude that E2F1
antagonizes RB-mediated autophagy and leads to apoptosis.
These results suggest that RB and E2F1 proteins play opposite
roles in the control of both autophagy and apoptosis.
Downregulation of E2F1 results in autophagy
Because RB needs to bind to E2F to induce autophagy, and
E2F1 antagonizes RB-mediated autophagy, we hypothesized

that cells lacking E2F1 expression would be more susceptible
to spontaneous autophagy and that the levels of autophagy in
these cells would be significantly higher than the levels in
control cells. To test this hypothesis, we used siRNA to
down-modulate E2F1 expression in U-87 MG cells. Silencing
the E2F1 gene resulted in the formation of autophagic vacuoles,
as documented by a dramatic lipidation of LC3 that caused
EGFP-LC3 punctation in more than 60% of the cells (Fig. 6A
and B). In contrast, less than 10% of the control cells showed
a dotted pattern (Fig. 6B). Consistently, immunoblotting analysis revealed that E2F1 siRNA downregulated E2F1 protein level
and caused the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 6C). These
results suggest that down-modulation of E2F1 is sufficient to
trigger autophagy and that E2F1 plays an active role in suppressing autophagy. Thus, the increased level of autophagy in E2F1–
down-modulated cells indirectly points to the inhibition of
E2F1 as the mechanism for RB-mediated autophagy.

Discussion
The RB/E2F1 pathway, which is crucial in regulating cell
growth and apoptosis, is disrupted in virtually all human
cancers (31). Here, we report that RB positively regulates
autophagy by repressing E2F1 activity. Our results indicate
that, instead of preventing autophagosome turnover in the
cells, RB activity, or lack of E2F1 activity, promotes autophagy flux, from the formation of autophagosomes to their fusion with lysosomes. Our data reveal a previously unknown
function of the RB/E2F1 pathway that might contribute to its
role in cancer suppression and resistance to cancer therapy.
A balanced RB/E2F1 pathway is required to maintain cellular homeostasis. We found that excessive RB activity or
lack of E2F1 causes autophagy, and RB/E2F interaction is required for RB-mediated autophagy. Moreover, excessive E2F1
activity antagonizes RB-induced autophagy, leading to apoptosis.

Figure 7. Rheostat model for the interplay of
RB and E2F1 to regulate autophagy and
apoptosis. Balanced RB and E2F1 activity
ensures homeostasis in the cell. Strong stimuli
may result in either excessive RB activity to
induce autophagy or immoderate E2F1 function
to cause apoptosis.

RB/E2F1 Pathway Regulates Autophagy

Therefore, in addition to the opposite roles of RB and E2F1 in
regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis (30), our data suggest a
model in which the interplay between RB and E2F1 also regulates autophagy (Fig. 7). We speculate that adequate RB/
E2F1 activity ensures a basal level of autophagy that is critical
to maintaining normal cellular and molecular processes in the
cell. Given the negative effects of autophagy on tumorigenesis (2), autophagy could be part of the mechanism through
which RB acts as a tumor suppressor. In this regard, the involvement of PTEN, p53, and RB, the three most frequently
mutated genes in human cancers, in regulating autophagy
suggests a strong mechanistic link between stress-sensing
pathways, autophagy, and tumor suppression. Tumor suppressors, such as RB, may induce autophagy as a housekeeping mechanism to recycle damaged macromolecules and
organelles to ensure the stability of the genome (32). In fact,
it has been reported that the basal levels of proteolysis or autophagic degradation in cancer cells were lower than those in
their normal counterparts (33). In this regard, cells that were
transformed by SV40, which can inactivate RB and p53,
had decreased levels of proteolysis compared with nontransformed or nontreated cells (34). Lately, autophagy was indicated as an effector mechanism of senescence (35). Given
the critical role that RB plays during cellular senescence (36)
and in the response to cancer therapeutics such as CDK
inhibitors (37), there might be a link between RB-mediated
autophagy and senescence and its consequential tumor
suppression.
Aside from its housekeeping function, autophagy can also
act as a protective mechanism to prolong cell survival under
stressful conditions (38). In certain scenarios, autophagy constitutes a stress adaptation that suppresses apoptosis to
avoid cell death (39). In addition to its central role in inhibiting cell proliferation, RB also plays a crucial role in inhibiting
apoptosis (7). Studies in RB-mutant mice show massive apoptosis in neurons (40). Interestingly, Atg7 deficiency in the
central nervous system also causes massive neuronal loss
in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices (41), suggesting a
cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis (39). Thus, on
top of autophagy/apoptosis regulation by RB/E2F1 interplay
(Fig. 7), RB-mediated autophagy might inhibit apoptosis as
well. Moreover, during its growth, the tumor is usually poorly
vascularized in the center area, and in this environment,
autophagy has a more prominent role in sustaining cell viability in cancer cells (42). Previous work has shown that most
sporadic cancers inactivate RB by phosphorylation, rather
than by mutations in the RB gene itself (7). Because phosphorylation is reversible, altering this posttranslational modification pathway of RB not only allows cancer cells to grow
aggressively but also gives these cells the option of reactivating RB for protection against apoptotic stimuli to exploit the
survival advantage conferred by RB under stress (7). For instance, glucose-regulated stress, a potent inducer of autophagy (12), causes stabilization of p27 (12) and decreased
expression of cyclin D1 (43), resulting in hypophosphorylation
of RB, which is the active form of the protein (6). Our data
show that CDKIs, such as p27 and p16, induce autophagy
in a RB-dependent manner (Fig. 3), indicating the involve-

www.aacrjournals.org

ment of RB-mediated autophagy in the stress response.
Thus, it is of clinical relevance to determine whether RB
activity in cancer cells expressing wild-type RB is partially
restored under these conditions to induce autophagy to
prevent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, results from experimental anticancer therapies suggest that autophagy activation represents a cellular attempt to survive the stress induced
by cytotoxic agents (2). In fact, it has been reported that
restoration of the RB protein in RB-deficient cells results in resistance to DNA-damaging agents including cisplatin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin (44, 45). In addition,
expression of p16 is associated with chemoresistance in glioma
and bladder cancer cells (10, 46). Overall, our study suggests
that RB-induced autophagy provides a possible new mechanistic link between RB, cancer cell survival, and resistance to
cancer therapy.
Although the role of RB in modulating autophagy seems to
be well defined here, the role of E2F1 could be more complex.
In fact, E2F1 has a dual role as a tumor suppressor and an
oncogene and, as such, can positively regulate both cell proliferation and cell death (47). Thus, E2F1 may exert a contextual role in autophagy as well. A weak E2F1 transactivation of
autophagy-related genes was observed in a drug-induced
E2F1-expressing system (48). However, our data show that
overactivated E2F1 blocked RB-induced autophagy and led
to apoptosis (Fig. 5). One of the possible molecular targets
of E2F1 in the suppression of autophagy is Bcl-2, which
blocks autophagy by binding Beclin 1 and prevents activation
of the PI3Kc3 complex (25). Our previously published results
revealed that Bcl-2 is a transcriptional target of E2F1 (26).
Here, we show that repression of E2F1 by RB leads to
down-modulation of Bcl-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 5),
contributing to the triggering of autophagy. The mammalian
TOR (mTOR) pathway is a key negative regulator of autophagy (49). We examined the phosphorylation status of
p70S6K, a substrate of mTOR (50). We did not observe any
changes in the total p70S6K level and its phosphorylation level after introducing RB into Saos-2 and MDNSC23 cells or
p16 into U-87 MG and U-2 OS cells (data not shown). We
assume that mTOR does not play a role under this circumstance. Thus, RB-induced autophagy is more relevant to
E2F1-mediated Bcl-2 expression than affecting the mTOR
pathway. However, it is now clear that E2F1 transactivates
more than 2,000 genes and that the role of E2F1 in regulating
transcription is highly dependent on context (47). Therefore,
it is overly simplistic to identify one or two players to completely explain the delicate balance between RB and E2F1 in
the regulation of autophagy. Besides, further study will be required to determine whether RB/E2F1 modulation of autophagy is independent of its role in cell cycle regulation.
On the other hand, RB interacts with more than 200
proteins (6), one of which is the hypoxia-inducible factor,
which is a potent inducer of autophagy under hypoxic
conditions (51). In these extreme circumstances, RB protein seems to negatively modulate hypoxia-inducible factor–
induced autophagy by attenuating BNIP3 induction (52).
However, in our system, transfer of RB to cancer cells under
normoxia resulted in the upregulation of BNIP3 (Supplementary

Fig. S3), suggesting a marked difference between the
regulation of autophagy under normoxic and hypoxic
conditions.
In summary, our data unequivocally show that the RB/
E2F1 pathway plays a role in the regulation of autophagy.
Moreover, the existence of such a rheostat-like module to
regulate the delicate balance between autophagy and apoptosis (Fig. 7) provides a new interpretation for the role of
RB in tumor suppression during development, cell survival
under stressful conditions, and cancer cell resistance to
therapy.
