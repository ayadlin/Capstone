Abstract
TGF-b is produced excessively by many solid tumors and can drive malignant progression through multiple
effects on the tumor cell and microenvironment. TGF-b signaling pathway inhibitors have shown efficacy in
preclinical models of metastatic cancer. Here, we investigated the effect of systemic LY2109761, a TGF-b type I/II
receptor (TbRI/TbRII) kinase inhibitor, in both a tumor allograft model and the mouse skin model of de novo
chemically induced carcinogenesis in vivo. Systemic LY2109761 administration disrupted tumor vascular
architecture and reduced myofibroblast differentiation of E4 skin carcinoma cells in a tumor allograft. In
the 7,12-dimethyl-benzanthracene plus phorbol myristate acetate–induced skin chemical carcinogenesis model,
acute dosing of established naive primary carcinomas with LY2109761 (100 mg/kg) every 8 hours for 10 days (100
mg/kg) diminished phospho-Smad2 (P-Smad2) levels and marginally decreased the expression of inflammatory
and invasive markers. Sustained exposure to LY2109761 (100 mg/kg/d) throughout the tumor outgrowth phase
had no effect on carcinoma latency or incidence. However, molecular analysis of resultant carcinomas by
microarray gene expression, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry suggests that long-term LY2109761
exposure leads to the outgrowth of carcinomas with elevated P-Smad2 levels that do not respond to drug. This is
the first description of acquired resistance to a small-molecule inhibitor of the TbRI/TbRII kinase. Resultant
carcinomas were more aggressive and inflammatory in nature, with delocalized E-cadherin and elevated
expression of Il23a, laminin V, and matrix metalloproteinases. Therefore, TGF-b inhibitors might be clinically
useful for applications requiring acute administration, but long-term patient exposure to such drugs should be
undertaken with caution. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2339–49. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
TGF-b is a potent growth inhibitor of normal epithelial cells
but is produced in excessive quantities by many advanced
tumor types (1). This excess TGF-b is thought to drive malignant progression through multiple effects both on the tumor
cell and on the tumor microenvironment (1–3). In accordance
with this hypothesis, local or systemically elevated levels of
TGF-b1 are associated with poor prognosis and the TGF-b

signaling pathway has become the focus for the design of
specific inhibitors for cancer therapy (4, 5).
TGF-b1 signals via a heteromeric complex of type I and type
II TGF-b receptors (TbRI/TbRII) that activates the canonical
Smad pathway by TbRI-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2
and Smad3. Nuclear shuttling of the resultant hexameric
complex, composed of receptor-associated phospho-Smads
(P-Smad) bound to Smad4, culminates in TGF-b–driven transcriptional responses (6). The TGF-b receptor complex can also
signal via non-Smad pathways to affect cell survival and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT; ref. 7). During
tumorigenesis, the TGF-b signaling pathway can be genetically
inactivated within the cancer cell, particularly in microsatellite
unstable gastrointestinal tract cancers, making the tumor cell
resistant to TGF-b growth inhibitory effects (8). Epigenetic
inactivation of the gene encoding the TGF-b type II receptor
(TGFBRII) has been observed in lung and prostate cancer (9,
10). Alternatively, in TGFBR2-positive tumors, activation of a
panoply of oncogenic signaling pathways within the cancer cell
can blunt the negative growth response to TGF-b and redirect
signaling output toward stimulation of tumor cell migration,
invasion, and, in some cases, increased proliferation and tumor
growth. Both in vivo and in vitro, this multistage passage toward
invasion and metastasis is often accompanied by transition

from an epithelial toward a fibroblastoid tumor cell phenotype
(11). In the chemically induced mouse skin model of tumorigenesis, resultant fibroblastoid spindle cell tumors are the
most aggressive cutaneous lesions, although distant metastases are frequently squamous in character.
The goal of TGF-b inhibition has been to target its tumorpromoting properties, both cell autonomous and microenvironmental, while avoiding inhibition of its tumor suppression
arm (5). There have been several preclinical reports on the use of
both large- and small-molecule inhibitors of the TGF-b signaling
pathway for various oncology applications. These inhibitors
have been particularly efficacious in metastatic carcinoma
models (12–15), utilizing multiple mechanisms to elicit effects.
Clinical trials have commenced, which, like their preclinical
counterparts, show promise for the treatment of metastatic
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and glioblastoma (16, 17).
In mice, negative consequences of long-term exposure to a
large-molecule inhibitor of TGF-b, Fc:TbRII, were few (12), yet
this drug was efficacious in reducing metastasis of injected
melanoma cells (13). More important, this soluble receptor
antagonist inhibited spontaneous metastasis of primary mammary tumors that arise in MMTV-Neu transgenics (12). Taken
together with preliminary reports on clinical trials with an
anti–TGF-b antibody (17), these data suggest that anti–TGF-b
drugs are well tolerated in mice and humans.
This study explores the therapeutic potential of LY2109761,
a small-molecule inhibitor of TbRI/TbRII receptor kinase that
targets activation of P-Smad2 and P-Smad3 and inhibits the
related kinase receptors Acvr1b (activin activated) and Acvrlc
(nodal activated). We show in a mouse skin model of chemically induced carcinogenesis that despite the favorable
outcomes of LY2109761 in inhibiting EMT in vitro and its
short-term effects on carcinomas in vivo, sustained pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-b signaling may have a protumor
effect with expansion of a more aggressive inflammatory drugresistant carcinoma phenotype expressing markers of invasion.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Murine cell lines used in this study were isolated from
chemically induced cutaneous carcinoma and have been very
well characterized with respect to genetic mutations and gene
expression profiles. These were provided by Allan Balmain at
the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). E4 and H11
cells were both single-cell clones from SN161, derived from a
lymph node metastasis of an F1.129 NIH mouse (18). D3 cells
were isolated from a primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
from an F1 M. musculus NIH  M. spretus animal (19). Where
indicated, cells were treated with 5 ng/mL rhTGF-b1 (R&D
Systems) and/or the TbRI/TbRII kinase inhibitor LY2109761
(20). Media containing TGF-b, LY2109761, and/or dimethyl
sulfoxide vehicle were refreshed every other day.
Animals
All animal work was done in accordance with a UCSF
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. Nude
mouse tumor allografts were generated by subcutaneous

2340

injection of E4 cells (1  107 cells/mL; 100 ul per site/mouse).
Tumors were harvested 10 days later.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Plasma samples were harvested from blood collected at 0.5,
2, 4, and 8 hours after oral administration of LY2109761 (100
mg/kg of body weight). Plasma LY2109761 levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at
the UCSF Drug Study Unit, Analytical Division.
Chemical carcinogenesis
Mice (8-week-old female inbred NIH/OlaHsd) underwent
standard dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)/phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) tumor induction as previously described
(11, 21). Tumors were initiated with DMBA, 25 mg/200 mL
acetone. The tumor promoter was PMA, 2 mg/200 mL acetone.
The experiment was terminated once carcinoma reached
1.5 cm, became ulcerated, or if the mouse showed signs of
morbidity. Carcinomas were diagnosed clinically, which was
confirmed by histologic analysis. LY2109761 (7.5 mg/mL) or
vehicle alone was administered by oral gavage in a polytroned
suspension in CMC/SLS/PVP/antifoam. Two dosing regimens
were used: the sustained dosing regimen was a daily single 100
mg/kg dose of LY2109761 every day, 7 days per week, from
week 6 post–DMBA administration throughout tumor outgrowth, as specified. The short-term dosing regimen was
administered to animals that had already established
DMBA/PMA-induced carcinoma, that is, 8 to 9-month-old
female mice roughly 25 weeks after DMBA treatment. This
regimen was 100 mg/kg LY2109761 given every 8 hours for 10
days.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out on 5-mm 4%
PFA-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Antibodies
included anti: a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA; Sigma), CD45
(Caltag Laboratories), E-cadherin (BD Biosciences), F4/80
(Caltag Laboratories), P-Smad2 (Cell Signaling), P-Smad2/3
(Santa Cruz), and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13; Santa
Cruz), and vimentin (Cell Signaling). CD31 staining was carried out using a Biocare Medical kit. TUNEL staining was
carried out using the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL system
(Promega). Quantification employed 10 fields of view per
sample. NIH ImageJ was used to determine pixel density
(P-Smad staining), tumor stroma area (vimentin staining),
and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling)-positive cell counts.
RNA isolation, labeling, and microarray hybridization
Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen carcinomas by
TRIzol (Invitrogen), using Ambion's DNA-free kit, and RNAs
were purified using RNeasy (Qiagen). Quantified RNAs were
amplified using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification
kit (Ambion). The effects of the sustained drug dosing
(LY2109761, n ¼ 3; vehicle, n ¼ 3) and short-term drug dosing
(LY2109761, n ¼ 4; vehicle, n ¼ 5) regimens on gene expression
were analyzed using the Illumina Mouse-WG-6 v2 platform.
Slides were scanned on an Illumina Beadstation, and data

were extracted using Illumina BeadStudio software and normalized by quantile normalization. Of 46,644 probes on the
microarray, 32% (14,818) had a present P value of 0.05 or less in
at least 80% of samples as assigned by BeadStudio, and these
probes were used for further analysis. Gene expression in both
treatment conditions was compared with that of matched
vehicle-treated control mice, using the Significance Analysis of
Microarrays algorithm (22), with a false discovery rate (FDR)
cutoff of 10%.
Western blotting
Protein extraction and Western blotting was carried out as
described previously (21). Antibodies included anti: P-Smad2
(Eli Lilly or Cell Signaling), total Smad2/3 (BD Biosciences), Ecadherin (BD Biosciences), RBPjk (Santa Cruz), Lgr6 (Santa
Cruz), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH;
Cell Signaling), or b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).

Results
LY2109761 inhibits and reverses TGF-b1–induced EMT
in vitro
Murine carcinoma cell lines, isolated from different stages
of chemically induced mouse skin tumorigenesis, were evaluated for their response to the LY2109761 inhibitor. Squamous
E4 cells, isolated from a lymph node metastasis of a squamous
cell carcinoma, convert to a fibroblastoid spindle phenotype
on addition of TGF-b in vitro or, if grown, as a subcutaneous
tumor in vivo. This EMT is driven cell-autonomously by TGF-b
signaling (23). A dose of 2 mmol/L LY2109761 was sufficient to
prevent Smad2 phosphorylation of both squamous and spindle E4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Prolonged
LY2109761 exposure elevated E-cadherin protein levels higher
than in the absence of exogenous TGF-b (Supplementary
Fig. S1A) and prevented and reversed (Supplementary
Fig. S1B and C) TGF-b1–induced EMT.
The D3 and H11 carcinoma lines are both innately spindle,
independently of exogenous TGF-b (18, 19), and both have
higher basal TGF-b signaling levels than E4 cells (ref. 24;
Supplementary Fig. S1D and E). Short- or long-term treatment
with LY2109761 reduced innate P-Smad2 levels in both cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1D and E), supporting the view that in
these cell lines, TbRI, Acvrlb, and/or Acvrlc actively signal to PSmad2 via a positive autocrine loop (24). In addition, the D3 cells
showed an LY2109761 dose-dependent increase in E-cadherin
protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1D), illustrating the
partial contribution of Smad2 signaling to the maintenance of
mesenchymal properties and the ability of LY2109761 to steer
the D3 cells toward a more epithelial phenotype.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
LY2109761 in vivo
To determine LY2109761 effects on TGF-b signaling in vivo,
3 doses of the drug were administered to mice at 50, 75, or 100
mg/kg body weight and tissue P-Smad2 levels were assessed 2
hours postoral gavage. In both lung and skin, P-Smad2 levels
were suppressed dose dependently, with partial inhibition at
50 and 75 mg/kg and almost complete inhibition at 100 mg/kg

Figure 1. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LY2109761 after
oral dosing in mice. A, mice were administered a single oral bolus of
LY2109761 at the indicated doses. P-Smad2 Western blot analysis was
carried out on protein lysates from lung and skin 2 hours after dosing. B,
plasma concentrations of LY2109761 in different mouse strains were
measured by HPLC at various time points following a single oral dose of
the drug (100 mg/kg). Mouse strains analyzed were 129, 129SvS2/Hsd;
C57/BL6; C57BL/6NTac; NIH, NIH/OlaHsd; 129/NIH, F1 between
129SvS2/Hsd and NIH/OlaHsd; Nude, NCR.nu/nuTac. C, inhibition of PSmad2 levels by LY2109761 was determined by Western blot analysis of
lung tissue from mice after a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg LY2109761. D,
tumor-bearing mice that had been subjected to thrice daily oral dosing with
LY2109761 at 100 mg/mL for 10 days (short term) were administered an
additional oral bolus of 100 mg/kg LY2109761 and protein lysates from
papilloma, carcinoma, and lung were isolated 2 hours later. Western blot
analysis was carried out to detect P-Smad2, total Smad2, and b-actin
levels.

(Fig. 1A). LY2109761 pharmacokinetics were determined
by HPLC analysis of murine plasma after a single oral dose
(100 mg/kg). By 4 hours, LY2109761 was rapidly cleared from
the circulation of all mouse strains tested (Fig. 1B). LY2109761
pharmacodynamics were assessed by examining pulmonary
P-Smad2 levels. Western blot analysis showed an acute downregulation of P-Smad2 1 hour postoral gavage, which was

maintained for at least 4 hours post–LY2109761 dosing and
returned to base levels by 8 hours (Fig. 1C). Therefore,
LY2109761 inhibits TGF-b signaling for a few hours after
the drug was cleared from the circulation. Administration
of a single 100 mg/kg LY2109761 dose to tumor-bearing mice
resulted in decreased P-Smad2 levels within both carcinomas
and papillomas (Fig. 1D), showing that drug effectively penetrated both benign and malignant tumors.

LY2109761 treatment of E4 tumor allografts in vivo
reduces carcinoma myofibroblasts and disrupts
vascular integrity
Subcutaneously injected E4 cells grow as aggressive, highly
vascularized spindle tumors. LY2109761 administered in
drinking water (2 mg/mL) ad libitum for 10 days significantly
reduced nuclear P-Smad2 expression (Fig. 2A and B) but had
no effect on tumor outgrowth (data not shown), apoptosis, or

Figure 2. LY2109761 reduces P-Smad2 expression, myofibroblast phenotype, and vascular integrity without effects on proliferation or apoptosis in E4
carcinoma allografts in vivo. Fourteen nude mice were inoculated bilaterally and subcutaneously with E4 carcinoma cells. For 10 days from the time of
inoculation, 2 mg/mL LY2109761 was provided ad libitum in drinking water to the experimental group (n ¼ 7) whereas the control group was fed normal water.
A, tumor sections from vehicle- and drug-treated mice were stained for P-Smad2. LY2109761 treatment led to a decrease in nuclear P-Smad2 expression. B,
ImageJ was used to determine the average pixel intensity of the nuclear P-Smad2 staining. Nuclei were scored as strong, weak, or negative for nuclear
P-Smad2. Five sections each of 5 independent allografts were quantified from both the LY2109761 and vehicle-treated mice. The decrease in P-Smad2
nuclear staining was significant (P < 0.001 by 2-way ANOVA). C, tumor sections were stained by TUNEL, and apoptosis was estimated as the average of
TUNEL-positive cells per representative field (5 allografts/treatment). D, mice were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) 2 hours before harvest of the tumor.
LY2109761- and vehicle-treated mice were examined for BrdU incorruption by anti-BrdU staining (5 allografts/treatment). Proliferation was estimated as the
average of the BrdU-positive cells per representative field. There was no significant difference between the drug and vehicle treatments in the percentage of
either apoptotic or proliferating cells. E and F, tumor sections from vehicle- and drug-treated mice, as indicated, were stained for (E) CD31/PECAM-1 or (F)
aSMA. Vehicle-treated tumors possessed a fine reticular capillary network of pericyte-invested, PECAM-1þ vessels, whereas the tumor vasculature of
LY2109761-treated mice was poorly invested with aSMAþ cells. Note that aSMA staining of vascular smooth muscle cells was more intense than that of the
myofibroblasts and that vessels within uninvolved skin were unaffected by LY2109761 (E, top). Vessels within drug-treated tumor stained weakly for
PECAM-1, were dilated, and filled with pooling red blood cells, with hemorrhaging into tumor tissue. Scale bar, 50 mm.

proliferation (Fig. 2C and D). However, LY2109761 treatment
did alter tumor histology. Whereas control tumors showed a
fine reticular network of CD31þ vessels invested with pericytes
and features of active angiogenesis such as noninvested
CD31þ cells (Fig. 2E), LY2109761-treated tumors displayed
disrupted vascular architecture. Vessels present in drug-treated tumors were dilated, with weak or no CD31þ staining, and
pooling of red blood cells suggestive of indolent blood flow
and hemorrhage (Fig. 2E).
It has been reported that increased carcinoma levels of
aSMA in tumors may be predictive of an aggressive phenotype
and the most invasive tumor types take on a myofibroblast
phenotype (24, 25). E4 spindle tumor cells from vehicle-treated

mice showed high levels of aSMA staining, and treatment with
LY2109761 decreased this expression (Fig. 2F). However,
unlike genetic inhibition of TGF-b signaling in this model
(23), there was not a complete reversion from spindle to
squamous morphology.
Sustained suppression of TGF-b signaling by LY2109761
increases chemically induced papilloma incidence
To determine the long-term effects of LY2109761 treatment
on DMBA/PMA-induced tumorigenesis, we dosed mice once
daily with LY2109761 during the papilloma and carcinoma
outgrowth phases of skin carcinogenesis. Three experiments
were conducted (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2). A pilot

LY2109761 at 100 mg/kg or vehicle alone (sustained drug treatment). Papilloma numbers were counted weekly. B, IHC evaluation of the effect of both

administration) and Sustained Exp 2 (LY2109761 100 mg/kg/daily from weeks 6 to 17). All mice were dosed with LY2109761 or vehicle, 2 hours prior to
collection of tumors. Note the positive P-Smad2 staining of both stromal fibroblasts and carcinoma cells in vehicle-treated carcinomas (arrowheads)
compared with downregulation of P-Smad2 in stromal fibroblasts (arrows) but not in carcinoma cells (arrowheads) in the LY2109761-treated carcinoma.

experiment (75 mg/kg dosing) showed a significant druginduced increase in papilloma numbers (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), but a larger replication study failed to show a
difference (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In a third experiment,
the drug dose was elevated to 100 mg/kg, which significantly
increased papilloma numbers in drug-treated mice compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3A). These findings are concordant with our previous studies, showing that elevation of
TGF-b1 expression via transgenesis reduced benign papilloma
number, but genetic reduction of TGF-b1 levels led to
increased papilloma numbers (11, 21).
The LY2109761 increase in papilloma number was not due
to a decrease in apoptosis (data not shown). Histologic
examination of papillomas revealed that compared with vehicle-treated mice, sustained LY2109761 treatment increased
the number of inflammatory (CD45þ) cells within the papilloma stroma (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that inflammation might contribute to increased papilloma incidence
(26). By morphology, most of the infiltrate seemed to be
neutrophilic, with a minority of macrophages. Interestingly,
there was no significant change in carcinoma number, malignant conversion frequency, or carcinoma latency in the
LY2109761-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice
(Supplementary Table S1).
Failure to downregulate P-Smad2 levels in tumors after
sustained LY2109761 treatment
P-Smad2 Western blot analysis of carcinoma cell lysates
(Fig. 3B) and P-Smad2 and P-Smad2/3 IHC analysis of tumors
(Fig. 3C) were undertaken on carcinoma that developed
following sustained LY2109761 treatment and that were collected 2 hours following the last drug dose. Surprisingly, this
analysis revealed that P-Smad2 was not significantly downregulated by LY2109761 (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4A)
and, in several carcinomas, P-Smad2 was in fact upregulated
in drug-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 3B and C and Supplementary Fig. S4C). In contrast,
nonmalignant fibroblast cells of the carcinoma stroma
showed decreased P-Smad2 staining in response to
LY2109761 treatment even after sustained drug exposure
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
We hypothesized that drug-refractile P-Smad2 signaling
in the tumor parenchyma was a malignant adaptation to
sustained TGF-b signaling inhibition, either by outgrowth of
a drug-resistant carcinoma population or by activation of PSmad2 by alternative intersecting pathways (27). To address
this issue, we investigated the effect of a shorter but more
frequent drug-dosing regimen (short term) on established
naive DMBA/PMA-induced primary carcinoma. Mice bearing full-blown DMBA/PMA-induced carcinoma 25 weeks
postinitiation were orally dosed with LY2109761 (100 mg/
kg) every 8 hours for 10 days (n ¼ 7 drug treated; n ¼ 7
vehicle treated). This treatment had no overt effect on
carcinoma morphology, but IHC showed variable degrees
of P-Smad2 downregulation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We
also evaluated lung tissue from these carcinoma-bearing
mice to determine the response of nonmalignant tissue to
LY2109761 treatment. Indeed, Western blot analysis (not

2344

shown) and IHC of lung tissue from mice on both the shortterm or sustained treatment regimens showed reduced
nuclear P-Smad2 levels in response to LY2109761 treatment
(Fig. 3D). Our findings of high levels of drug-insensitive
nuclear P-Smad2 after sustained LY2109761 treatment were
validated by IHC analysis of P-Smad2 levels in carcinoma
from an independent study, in which mice received
LY2109761 on a sustained dosing regimen from week 6 until
week 17 post–DMBA administration (Sustained Exp 2;
Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4C). Together, these data
suggest that acquired drug resistance was limited to malignant tissue and occurred predominantly after sustained
drug dosing.
We investigated whether the high levels of P-Smad2 seen
after sustained treatment might be due to a rebound effect on
TGF-b signaling leading to hyperactivation of P-Smad2
between drug doses. Mice were treated once daily for 7 or
more days with the LY2109761 inhibitor (100 mg/kg), and lung
tissue was collected at various times after the last drug dose.
Western blot analysis showed that P-Smad2 levels were suppressed at 2 hours, returning to near baseline by 16 hours
posttreatment, but even after 24 hours, when the next drug
dose would normally be administered, there was no increase
in P-Smad2 levels above those observed in the control arm
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Increased P-Smad2 levels in carcinomas following sustained LY2109761 treatment were therefore unlikely due to a rebound effect.
To investigate the stage of onset of acquired LY2109761
resistance, benign papillomas harvested from the same
carcinoma-bearing mice described earlier were assayed
for nuclear P-Smad2 levels. There was a significant decrease
in nuclear P-Smad2 levels in papillomas from the short-term
dosing regimen compared with matched vehicle-treated
controls, but no significant P-Smad2 response after sustained LY2109761 treatment compared with matched vehicle-treated papillomas (Supplementary Fig. S6). Therefore,
drug resistance was observed even at the papilloma stage,
albeit at experiment termination following many weeks of
LY2109761 treatment. Papillomas at earlier stages were not
collected.
Sustained suppression of TGF-b signaling induces a
proinvasive gene signature
Because sustained LY2109761 administration seemed to
paradoxically increase carcinoma P-Smad2 levels, we hypothesized that the resultant carcinomas may be more aggressive
despite the fact that there was no drug-induced change in
spindle to squamous character (Supplementary Table S2). To
probe the molecular makeup of the carcinomas further,
microarray gene expression analysis was conducted on carcinomas from both drug-dosing regimens and their matched
vehicle controls. After statistical correction for genome-wide
testing, there were no significant changes (1.5-fold) in gene
expression between the 2 vehicle-treated arms of the 2 experiments or between matched drug- and vehicle-treated carcinoma on the sustained treatment regimen (FDR  10%). The
short-term dosing regimen resulted in a significant reduction
in expression of only one gene: short stature homebox 2

(Shox2; Q  0.1%; Fig. 4), a modulator of embryonic EMT (28).
We speculated that using the stringent statistical analysis
employed, inherent heterogeneity between different carcinomas masked any drug-induced changes in gene expression.
In contrast, direct comparison between drug-treated carcinomas from both drug-dosing regimens revealed more than
800 significant differences in gene expression (FDR  10%)
between the 2 drug regimens (FDR  10%), of which approximately 300 were 1.5-fold or more (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Table S3). These data indicate that subthreshold changes in
gene expression had occurred in response to drug treatment
under both regimens but that directionality of these changes
was appositional such that they were only statistically detectable by direct comparison between the 2 drug arms (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
Gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment for the
expression of genes encoding key extracellular matrix proteins
and receptors, cytoskeletal proteins, and chemokines in the
drug-treated carcinomas of the sustained versus short-term
dosing regimens. All 3 components of laminin 332 (Lama3,
Lamb3, and Lamc2) were elevated approximately 2-fold by
sustained drug treatment. These same genes were downre-

gulated approximately 30% by the short-term dosing regimen
(Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, the Itgb1 gene, which
encodes a component of a cognate laminin 322 receptor,
exhibited increased expression following sustained
LY2109761 treatment compared with the short-term dosing
regimen (Supplementary Table S3). Both laminin 332 and Itgb1
have been shown to be centrally involved in SCC tumor
invasion (29).
Increases in MMP expression and/or activity have also been
linked to tumor cell invasion, and sustained LY2109761 treatment led to a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in Mmp3, Mmp10, Mmp9,
and Mmp13 compared with the short-term dosing regimen
(Supplementary Table S3). In the case of MMP13, this observation was validated by IHC (Fig. 5A). Many other genes
involved in extracellular matrix remodeling showed similar
increases in expression after sustained drug treatment but
slight decreases after the short-term dosing regimen, including latent TGF-b binding protein 2 (Ltbp2), Bmp1, and Pcolce2
(Supplementary Table S3). In addition, markers of EMT,
including Msx1 and Twisted2, were elevated by sustained
drug treatment but downregulated by the short-term dosing regimen. Intriguingly, Lgr6, reportedly a multipotential

keratinocyte stem cell marker (30), and Fermd4A, also
reported to mark keratinocyte stem cells (31), were both
found to be elevated in carcinoma after sustained drug
treatment (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Table S4). RbpjK, a component of the notch signaling pathway that is important in
stem cell fate, angiogenesis, and EMT (32, 33), was also
elevated in carcinomas after sustained drug treatment. These
findings from microarray analysis were validated by Western
blot estimation of protein levels for Lgr6 and RbpjK (Fig. 5B).
Finally, inflammatory gene signatures showed divergent
trends in gene expression between the 2 drug regimens.
Il23a, which is known to promote inflammatory tumor progression in the DMBA/PMA model (26), was increased in
carcinomas after sustained drug exposure. Several genes
involved in leukocyte cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization (Jam2, Icam, Nfat5, and Msn) showed the same
reciprocal gene expression pattern between the 2 drug-dosing
regimens. The potent macrophage chemoattractants Ccl3
(MIP1-a) and Ccl4 (MIP1-b) were also elevated after sustained
drug treatment but suppressed following short-term dosing.
Similar observations were made for other inflammatory markers, including the tumor cell marker CD274 (increased 3.6fold in the sustained drug treatment group) which is involved
in suppression of antitumor CD8þ T cell. In conclusion,
sustained drug treatment induced a gene expression signature
indicative of a more aggressive and invasive carcinoma type
with elevated inflammatory markers compared to vehicletreated carcinoma, or to the short-term drug dosing regimen.

Sustained LY2109761 exposure results in expansion of
tumor stroma and delocalized E-cadherin within
carcinoma cells in vivo
Although histologic examination indicated no difference in
spindle carcinoma incidence after sustained drug treatment
(Supplementary Table S2), we further investigated the possibility of paradoxical induction of EMT by LY2109761 by using
IHC for E-cadherin (epithelial) and vimentin (mesenchymal).
There was consistent delocalization of E-cadherin in carcinoma cells after sustained LY2109761 treatment compared
with the characteristic cell–cell junctional localization of Ecadherin seen in carcinomas either from vehicle-treated mice
or after the LY2109761 short-term dosing regimen (Fig. 6A and
Supplementary Table S5). There was no carcinoma cell vimentin expression in any of the treatments; however, vimentin
staining revealed a significant expansion of the tumor stroma
compartment after sustained LY2109761 treatment compared
with vehicle-treated carcinoma or to drug-dosed carcinoma
on the short-term dosing regimen (Fig. 6B and C). These data,
showing delocalization of E-cadherin in carcinoma and an
expanded vimentin-positive tumor stromal compartment,
were replicated in an independent DMBA/PMA study in which
mice underwent 11 weeks of sustained drug dosing during the
tumor outgrowth phase (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S5).

Discussion
Here, we reveal that sustained suppression of TGF-b signaling in vivo results in the outgrowth of carcinomas that are
apparently resistant to the small-molecule TbR1/TbRII inhibitor LY2109761. We show marked differences in the outcome
of LY2109761 treatment of carcinoma cells in vitro, tumor
allografts in vivo, and primary carcinomas in situ. Furthermore, the data illustrate that in the same in vivo model of
carcinogen-induced primary tumor outgrowth and progression, the outcome of LY2109761 treatment can be either
antitumorigenic or protumorigenic, depending on the precise
drug-dosing regimen.
Short-term, high-dose LY2109716 treatment could not completely reverse TGF-b–induced carcinoma EMT in either the
E4 allograft or primary chemically induced carcinoma models.
These data were in contrast with our previous finding using
genetic inhibition of autocrine TGF-b signaling in E4 cells in
vitro and in vivo (23). Nevertheless, short-term LY2109716
treatment did reduce the levels of aSMA and Shox2 in the
allograft and DMBA/PMA models, respectively, which suggests a trend toward a less myofibroblast phenotype in mice
treated continuously with drug for 10 days. Failure to definitively replicate inhibition of EMT after blockade of TGF-b
signaling inhibition (23) could be due to additional effects of
LY2109761 on the tumor stroma that potentiates tumorigenesis (34, 35) and/or inadequate drug delivery to the tumor
parenchyma, especially in the light of vascular disruption in
response to LY2109761 in the tumor allograft model.
In concordance with predictions from earlier studies using
genetically manipulated TGF-b1 or TbRII (11, 21, 36), we show
that long-term daily LY2109761 treatment during tumor outgrowth increased papilloma number, supporting a suppressive

effect of TGF-b in early tumorigenesis. Analysis of the papillomas suggests that these tumor-suppressive effects may be, at
least in part, due to the immunosuppression of TGF-b signaling. Inflammation has been suggested to act either protectively via immune surveillance or via a protumorigenic
manner, depending on the nature of the inflammatory cell
infiltrate (37). In the mouse skin model of chemical carcinogenesis, inflammation has clearly been shown to be protumorigenic (26, 38). In agreement with these observations, we
have shown that sustained LY2109761 treatment resulted in a
significant increase in CD45þ neutrophilic infiltrate within the
papilloma stroma.
Importantly, we have shown that sustained treatment with
LY2109761 during the tumor outgrowth phase resulted in
resistance to drug-induced P-Smad2 downregulation, specifically in malignant tumor cells but not in tumor stromal
fibroblasts or normal tissue. The development of acquired
drug resistance to both conventional chemotherapeutics and
targeted therapies is a common undesirable outcome in
malignant disease. The mechanisms of acquired drug resistance are varied and, for targeted small-molecule therapies,
might be somewhat complex (39, 40). However, understanding
of these mechanisms of drug resistance will allow modifica-

tion of therapeutic strategies that lead to more efficacious
treatments. Mechanisms of acquired drug resistance include
amplification of the target gene, as seen in acquired resistance
to Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (41), and activation of
alternative signaling pathways (39, 42) and perturbations in
the intermolecular cross-talk between interacting ligands,
tyrosine kinases, or their kinase-inactive partners (39, 40, 43).
There are several possible explanations for our unexpected
findings of outgrowth of tumor cells with high levels of
LY2109761-resistant P-Smad2. The simplest would be inadequate drug delivery, possibly as a consequence of vascular
disruption. However, this is unlikely, bearing in mind that
LY2109761 can downmodulate P-Smad2 in the tumor stroma
even after sustained drug treatment. Moreover, the sustained
dosing regimen resulted in a molecular carcinoma phenotype
distinct from that of either vehicle-treated or short-term drugtreated mice. Mutation of the ATP/drug-binding site of TbRI,
Acvr1b, or Acvr1c may confer drug resistance (e.g., ref. 44), as
would mutational hyperactivation of the kinase receptor (45).
Genetic alterations that influence P-Smad2 levels downstream
or parallel to TbRI (27) may also provide mechanisms to
bypass LY2107961 effects. TGF-b signaling is known to be
finely regulated by both negative and positive feedback

mechanisms, and, in tumor cells, signaling may be regulated
by trans receptor interactions that might be perturbed in the
presence of LY2109761. This drug is known to inhibit type I
receptors that signal for activins, GDF3, nodal, and myostatin.
It is therefore conceivable that perturbation of one or more of
these signaling pathways within the tumor cell or tumor
microenvironment might lead to expansion of a more aggressive tumor type. In this study, it was noted that the LY2109761
target TbRI was upregulated more than 1.5-fold in the sustained LY2109761-treated carcinomas. This might be due to
disruption of a negative feedback loop on TbRI levels and/or
indirectly caused by expansion of a cellular compartment,
characterized by high TbRI expression (46, 47).
Importantly, not only was there resistance to LY2109761mediated attenuation of carcinoma P-Smad2 levels but also
these carcinomas took on a more aggressive molecular profile,
with upregulation of markers of EMT and inflammation,
illustrated by delocalization of cell surface E-cadherin and
expansion of a vimentin-positive tumor stroma, and elevated
expression of proinflammatory markers. In contrast, carcinomas treated on the short-term LY2109761 dosing regimen
showed the inverse trend, with downregulation of markers of
EMT such as Msx1 and Shox2. It would seem that many of the
protumorigenic effects of LY2109761 are likely driven by the
action of this drug on the tumor stroma, leading to immune
cell infiltration, stromal cell expansion, and subsequent feedback via growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor,
which drive the outgrowth of LY2109761-resistant carcinomas, as has been seen in genetic models of TGF-b signaling
inhibition (34, 35). There is an increasing appreciation of the
importance of the interaction between the carcinoma cell and
its substratum in driving tumor progression, particularly with
respect to matrix density and stiffness (48, 49). The expansion

of the tumor stroma and the prevalence of ECM components,
junctional adhesion molecules, and integrins in genes upregulated after sustained exposure to LY2109761 would all
support the concept of a stromal-driven enhancement in
aggressive molecular phenotype.
In conclusion, this study shows that although TGF-b inhibitors might be clinically useful for short-term patient exposure (50), long-term treatment with TGF-b inhibitors should
be administered with caution. Dosing regimen is clearly
critical, and recommended dosage might vary considerably
on the basis of tumor type and TGF-b signaling status. Further
investigation of mechanism of acquired drug resistance might
provide more efficacious routes to therapy.
