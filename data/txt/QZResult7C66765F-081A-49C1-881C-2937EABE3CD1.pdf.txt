BACKGROUND: New therapies for metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have improved survival in clinical trials. However,
only a minority of patients receive systemic therapy. This article reports treatment patterns and outcomes for a population of Canadian patients with metastatic NSCLC (Ontario). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC from 2005 to 2009 were identified through multiple linked provincial databases. Patient demographics, systemic treatment, and survival were examined over time.
RESULTS: Metastatic NSCLC patients (n 5 8113) were identified. The median age was 68 years; 39% had adenocarcinoma, 14% had
squamous carcinoma, and a higher than expected proportion (43%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified. Only 24% the patients
received first-line chemotherapy; only 31% of these received second-line chemotherapy. More patients received systemic therapy over
time (from 19% in 2005 to 26% in 2009, P <.0001). Patients who were less than 70 years old or had adenocarcinoma were more likely
to receive systemic therapy (P <.0001 for both). The median survival, regardless of age, for those selected to receive first-line cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy was longer than that for those receiving other nonpemetrexed platinum doublets at 11.6 months
(P 5.0002). Patients with nonsquamous histology who were treated with second-line pemetrexed had longer median survival than
those treated with docetaxel (19.8 vs 14.1 months, P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with metastatic NSCLC in the general
population still do not receive systemic therapy. Those selected for first- and second-line systemic treatment, including older patients,
have survival outcomes comparable to clinical trial results. Older patients and patients with squamous histology are less likely
to receive chemotherapy. The low levels of treatment utilization in this study warrant further investigation. Cancer 2015;121:2562-9.

INTRODUCTION
The treatment of metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has changed significantly over the past 3 decades.
Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated that survival, symptom control, and quality of life can be improved with firstand second-line chemotherapy as well as newer targeted therapies.1-9 Although these treatments represent significant
advances, their impact on overall survival is modest and is often measured in months.
Recent studies investigating treatment patterns of metastatic NSCLC among older patients in the United States have
indicated that only a minority of patients receive systemic therapy.10-12 This may not be limited to elderly patients alone
and may be occurring among NSCLC patients in general. Although there are data supporting the benefit of systemic treatment in the majority of patients with metastatic NSCLC, including elderly patients and lesser performance status
patients,13-17 there appears to be a reticence to employ systemic therapy. This is likely multifactorial, with contributing
factors from patients, oncologists, referring physicians, and system issues. For example, chemotherapy toxicity without a
larger survival benefit may lead some patients, referring physicians, and even oncologists not to consider systemic therapy
for advanced NSCLC. Access issues, including diagnostic and treatment wait times, the geographic proximity of treatment, and treatment funding, may also contribute. From the oncologist’s perspective, the reluctance to offer systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC may also be related to perceived differences between an idealized clinical trial patient
population and the real-world NSCLC population. Patients included in clinical trials usually have excellent performance

status and fewer comorbidities and are younger than the
general NSCLC population, and this may limit the
applicability of clinical trial results in the minds of many
practitioners.18 These concerns regarding the generalizability of clinical trials results and the low uptake of systemic therapy among elderly patients generate uncertainty
about how clinical trial findings have affected practice patterns, treatment costs, and survival outcomes at the population level.10-12
Here we report the results of a large-scale, retrospective, population-based study of all patients diagnosed
with stage IV NSCLC in the province of Ontario between
2005 and 2009. We have specifically examined practice
patterns with respect to systemic treatment, survival outcomes, and changes in chemotherapy costs over time.

Statistical Methods

Patient demographics and treatment patterns were summarized. The association between chemotherapy treatment and demographic, tumor, and system variables was
investigated with logistic regression analysis. An odds ratio
greater than 1 indicated a higher chance of receiving
chemotherapy. Survival was calculated from the date of
diagnosis with the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine survival outcomes by age and among those receiving first- and
second-line chemotherapy. Factors were included in the
multivariate analysis if they reached a significance level of
P < .25 in the univariate analysis. Statistical analysis was
performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohort and Patient Data

Institutional ethics approval was received for this study,
which was also reviewed and approved by Cancer Care
Ontario. All patients diagnosed with metastatic (stage IV)
NSCLC in the province of Ontario between 2005 and
2009 were identified through the Ontario Cancer Registry. Ontario is the most populous province in Canada
with a population of 13.6 million individuals, and it collects all patient diagnostic and treatment data in several
centralized databases with dedicated personnel for data retrieval and coding. This time period was selected to ensure
the completeness of data, including survival outcomes.
Systemic therapy and radiation data, publicly funded and
centrally recorded for all patients, were obtained from the
Cancer Care Ontario Activity Level Reporting and New
Drug Funding Program databases and were linked with
registry data. Each record, including the diagnosis date,
institution and region of diagnosis, stage, pathology, age,
sex, and date of death (where available), was reviewed.
Cases with a postmortem diagnosis were excluded, as were
cases with non-lung cancer diagnoses or cases misclassified
through a review of treatment regimens (reviewed by
A.G.S. and N.B.L.). Treatment records, including the
chemotherapy regimen, dose, treatment dates, treating
hospital, and line of therapy, for the patient cohort were
identified and linked with registry data. Radiotherapy
treatment dates and doses were similarly identified and
linked. Oral agents were not systematically included in
these databases, and thus epidermal growth factor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor usage was not included in this study. Performance status and comorbid conditions, including renal
function and symptom burden, were also not available in
the database.

Cohort Demographics

A total of 8113 patients diagnosed with metastatic
NSCLC were identified from registry data between 2005
and 2009. Among these patients, the median age was 68
years (range, 28-96 years); half of the patients were male
(54%); and most (92%) were diagnosed and treated at regional cancer centers (see Table 1). The median time from
the pathologic diagnosis to the initial oncology consultation was 31 days, and 70% of the patients had at least 1
consultation with a medical oncologist.
The most common pathologic subtypes reported
were adenocarcinoma (39% of cases) and squamous
carcinoma (14%). Rarer subtypes, including mixed adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, carcinoid, and poorly differentiated large cell types, constituted a minority of cases
(4%). Forty-three percent of the cases were reported as
NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS).
Treatment Patterns

Most patients did not receive chemotherapy (76%).
Twenty-four percent of the patients received at least 1 line
of chemotherapy, 16% received first-line chemotherapy
only, and 8% received both first- and second-line chemotherapy (Fig. 1). The percentage of patients who received
chemotherapy increased slightly but significantly over
time, from 19% in 2005 to 26% in 2009 (P < .0001).
The likelihood of receiving chemotherapy was not
affected by whether a patient was diagnosed in a community hospital or a regional cancer center (P 5 .47).
The median age of patients receiving chemotherapy
was 63 years, whereas it was 70 years for those who did
not receive chemotherapy. Those older than 70 years were
significantly less likely to receive treatment with chemotherapy (odds ratio, 0.3; P < .0001; Table 1). The

adenocarcinoma subtype was associated with a higher
likelihood of receiving chemotherapy than squamous carcinoma (odds ratio, 1.3; P < .0001).
Most patients who received first-line chemotherapy
were treated with a platinum doublet (89%). Notably,
neither pemetrexed nor bevacizumab was funded in Ontario during this period as part of first-line platinumbased therapy. Doublet use included cisplatin/gemcita2564

bine (22%), carboplatin/gemcitabine (22%), carboplatin/
paclitaxel (15%), cisplatin/vinorelbine (12%), carboplatin/vinorelbine (6%), or other doublets (5.5%). A small
number of patients received single agent vinorelbine
chemotherapy as well (2.5%). A number of patients also
switched regimens during treatment and most commonly
substituted carboplatin for cisplatin (15%). There was no
significant change in the distribution of first-line regimens
used over time.
Patients treated with second-line parenteral chemotherapy received either docetaxel (52%), pemetrexed
(41%), or rarely other chemotherapy (7%). A significant
increase in the use of pemetrexed was seen in 2008 when
it was administered to 70% of those treated; this corresponded to a change in government policy to fund
second-line pemetrexed for nonsquamous carcinoma
patients.
Survival Outcomes

The median follow-up time for the entire cohort was
16.9 months (range, 0.03-72.6 months). The median
survival from diagnosis for patients who did not receive
chemotherapy was 3.3 months (95% confidence interval
[CI], 3.2-3.4 months). Among patients selected to
receive first-line chemotherapy only, the median survival

was 8.2 months (95% CI, 7.7-8.6 months). The median
survival of patients who received both first- and secondline chemotherapy was 16.2 months (95% CI, 15.1-17.0
months; Fig. 2A).
For the 1511 patients who received the most common first-line treatments, the median survival was longer
among patients who received cisplatin/gemcitabine (11.6
months; 95% CI, 10.3-13.8) versus those who received
other regimens (range, 8.4-9.3 months; Fig. 2B).
Adjusted for sex, year of diagnosis, and pathologic subtype, the risk of death was lower for patients selected to
receive cisplatin/gemcitabine (hazard ratio, 0.75;
P 5 .0001; Table 2). Female sex and adenocarcinoma
histology also were associated with a significantly lower
risk of death (P < .0001 and P 5 .01, respectively). Age

switched between multiple first-line treatment regimens
or were enrolled in clinical trials combining chemotherapy with an experimental agent were excluded from the
survival analysis.
Among patients with nonsquamous histology who
received either docetaxel or pemetrexed as second-line
therapy, those treated with pemetrexed had a longer median survival (19.8 months; 95% CI, 17.8-24.5 months)
than those treated with docetaxel (14.1 months; 95% CI,
12.7-15.0 months; Fig. 2C). The hazard ratio for survival
with pemetrexed treatment versus docetaxel was 0.45

(n 5 465; 95% CI, 9.8-12.3 months) for patients  70
years old and 10.1 months for younger patients
(n 5 1479; 95% CI, 9.6-10.8 months). Similar treatment
associations in older and younger patients were seen; the
survival hazard ratios associated with first-line treatment
versus no chemotherapy were 0.50 and 0.47 for the older
and younger subgroups, respectively, and the hazard ratios
for second-line treatment were 0.32 and 0.26, respectively
(Table 3).
Lastly, we examined the median survival of
untreated patients by year of diagnosis to better understand the effect of changing medical practice (eg, best supportive care and imaging modalities) over time on
survival. This revealed no significant difference in median
survival by year of diagnosis with a median survival of 3.3
months (95% CI, 3.2-3.6 months) in 2005 and a median
survival of 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.9-3.4 months) in 2009
(P 5 .11).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the treatment patterns and outcomes
of all patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC in Ontario, the most populous province in Canada. The composition of this cohort was consistent with populationbased data from the United States,19,20 including a predominance of older adults with nonsquamous histology.
Those patients who received chemotherapy were treated
according to evidence-based guidelines that link treatment
to reimbursement through the publicly funded health
care system in Ontario. In addition, the majority of the
patients were treated at specialized regional cancer centers.
The uptake of newer agents occurs quickly as demonstrated by the rapid shift in the use of second-line pemetrexed after the province’s decision to approve funding of
pemetrexed.
Among those who were selected to receive systemic
therapy, survival outcomes were in keeping with those
seen in phase 3 clinical trials.1-9,15,18 This was true for
both first- and second-line chemotherapy treatment.
Although a slight improvement in overall survival was
noted in patients selected to receive cisplatin-gemcitabine
in the first-line setting, this may be attributed to a tendency to reserve this chemotherapy regimen for better performance status patients because of its side effect profile.
An interesting difference in survival was noted between
patients with nonsquamous carcinoma treated with pemetrexed and patients treated with docetaxel. Even though
we controlled for known patient characteristics, those
who received pemetrexed appeared to have an increased
median survival. This apparent benefit may be related to

potential better efficacy in this group and to the preferable
toxicity profile associated with pemetrexed.13 The potential for preferential benefit in select subgroups, such as
patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged NSCLC, has previously been described.21-23 However, these results from this population-based study
should be interpreted with caution because of previous
randomized clinical trial evidence demonstrating equivalence in survival outcomes between both various platinum
doublets in first-line therapy and between docetaxel and
pemetrexed in second-line treatment.4,7
In interpreting the results of this study, we must consider several key limitations. Because of the limitations of
the databases used in this study, we could not account for
clinical characteristics, including comorbidities and performance status, in this study. Our study also could not
account for other data missing from the databases used,
including oral anticancer drugs and systemic therapy provided outside the public health care system in private clinics (albeit uncommon in the study time period). The rate
of NSCLC NOS histology is also higher than expected in
this study and likely attributable to a lack of standardized
pathology practice surrounding histological subtyping in
NSCLC in Ontario during the time period analyzed in
the study. It is also important to consider the role of other
potential confounders in this study, including stage
migration and improvement in best supportive care over
time; however, these factors alone are unlikely to severely
compromise this study’s findings regarding the clinical
benefit of systemic treatment and low chemotherapy utilization rates. The effect of stage migration and changes in
best supportive care are further minimized by the brief period of data collection and the lack of access to publicly
funded positron emission tomography staging in Ontario
until the end of 2009. Furthermore, the absence of any
significant difference in median survival among untreated
patients by year of diagnosis provides further evidence of
the minimal influence of these potential confounders.
Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study’s
finding that more than 75% of patients diagnosed with
metastatic NSCLC received no chemotherapy remains
disconcerting. Although this phenomenon is more pronounced among those older than 70 years (with 87%
untreated), it occurs widely among younger patients as
well (67% untreated). Studies conducted in the United
States of older adults with lung cancer have similarly
revealed low treatment rates on the basis of Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and state registry data, although treatment rates among younger patients
may potentially be higher in the United States10-12,24

(Supporting Table 1 [see online supporting information]). These studies have consistently demonstrated that
only approximately 30% of eligible elderly patients
receive systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC. We have
shown a strong association in this study between increasing age and decreasing likelihood of receiving systemic
therapy. At the same time, we have demonstrated similar
hazard ratios with systemic treatment, regardless of age.
These data are consistent with growing evidence of benefit
from systemic treatment for elderly patients and even for
those with marginal performance status.13-15 This study
provides additional evidence to support the increasing
concern that elderly patients with advanced NSCLC are
likely undertreated and that the potential benefits of systemic therapy in these patients underestimated.
However, more than half of patients with advanced
NSCLC, regardless of age, were unlikely to receive treatment in our study. Were they not eligible for reasons of
performance status or comorbid conditions? Did they
decline palliative systemic therapy for their lung cancer, or
was it not offered? A recent study population-based study
conducted by Noonan et al25 in British Columbia
revealed a similarly low rate of treatment, which could
only partially be explained by poor performance status,
with 37% of the patients having an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status  3. A greater
understanding of the reasons for undertreatment of all
patients with advanced NSCLC, particularly older adults,
is needed along with greater education about the clinical
benefit from treatment. Barriers to accessing systemic
chemotherapy, including therapeutic nihilism on the part
of patients and health care providers and a lack of referral
to a medical oncologist, are also potential contributors to
this phenomenon. However, the finding that 70% of the
patients in this study were assessed by a medical oncologist
suggests that a lack of referral to a medical oncologist can
explain only a minority of untreated cases.
Because of these concerning findings, a greater emphasis on ensuring that all patients with newly diagnosed
advanced NSCLC receive timely consultation with a
trained oncologist is essential. The gap between the diagnosis and the initial oncology consultation in this study
was 30 days. Minimizing the time from the diagnosis to
the initial consultation will reduce the likelihood that
patients will deteriorate clinically and will no longer be
systemic therapy candidates by the time they are seen by a
medical oncologist. In addition, reducing the time taken
to diagnose a patient with advanced NSCLC is also likely
to improve the number of patients who are candidates for
systemic therapy. The increasing use of screening methods
2568

for NSCLC in at-risk populations holds significant potential to diagnose NSCLC patients both at earlier stages of
disease and before they are no longer candidates for chemotherapy because of disease progression and functional
decline.26 Reducing delays in the initial diagnosis as well
as the time from the diagnosis to the initial oncology consultation thus has great potential for increasing the number of patients who are able to benefit from systemic
therapy.
Lastly, further investigation is needed to better
examine the characteristics of the untreated majority of
patients with advanced NSCLC to identify other currently unknown factors contributing to low treatment
rates. This will allow the rigorous exploration of the key
determinants of the low rates of systemic therapy utilization identified in this study and others and thus allow the
development of better evidence-based strategies to
improve treatment access and outcomes in this
population.
