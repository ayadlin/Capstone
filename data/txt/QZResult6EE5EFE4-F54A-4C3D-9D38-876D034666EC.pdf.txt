ABSTRACT
Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited
therapeutic options. Both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by oncogenic
mutations in the G-protein alpha subunit q and 11. Furthermore, nearly 40% of UM
has amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, with
consequent anomalies of MYC copy number. Chromatin regulators have become
attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression with
antiproliferative activity in hematopoietic and solid tumors. Here we provide evidence
that JQ1 had cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines carrying Gnaq/11 mutations, while in
cells without the mutations had little effects. Using microarray analysis, we identified
a large subset of genes modulated by JQ1 involved in the regulation of cell cycle,
apoptosis and DNA repair. Further analysis of selected genes determined that the
concomitant silencing of Bcl-xL and Rad51 represented the minimal requirement
to mimic the apoptotic effects of JQ1 in the mutant cells, independently of c-Myc.
In addition, administration of JQ1 to mouse xenograft models of Gnaq-mutant UM
resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth.
Collectively, our results define BRD4 targeting as a novel therapeutic intervention
against UM with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations.

displaces BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the
suppression of c-Myc [2], and c-Myc-dependent target
genes [6–9]. BET inhibition proved to be highly effective
against hematopoietic cancers [4, 6, 8, 10], as well as a
subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines [11], glioblastoma
[12] and medulloblastoma [13]. Bromodomain targeting
in cutaneous melanoma inhibited the expression of
several BRD4-regulated genes, including c-Myc, SKP2
and ERK1 [14]. These studies also demonstrated that
although BET inhibitors influence predominantly the MYC
transcriptome, other genes undergo expressional changes
and simultaneously contributed to the decrease of cell
viability.
Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common
primary intraocular malignancy of the adult eye. The
median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease is
3.6 months, with a 5-year cumulative survival of less
than 1% [15]. UM is biologically distinct from cutaneous

INTRODUCTION
Aberrant epigenetic regulation plays a central role
into the genesis of cancer [1]. BET inhibitors are emerging
therapeutics in oncology that specifically disrupt the
interaction between BET proteins and chromatin, resulting
in the inhibition of cancer growth [2, 3]. The BET family
of proteins, including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT
are chromatin readers containing two tandem ­aminoterminal bromodomains that bind to acetylated lysine
residues on histone tails. Here, they direct the assembly
of nuclear macromolecular complexes that regulate key
biologic processes, including DNA replication, chromatin
remodeling and transcription [2, 4]. In particular BRD4
was shown to associate to a protein complex that included
P-TEFb and to stimulate RNA Polymerase II-dependent
transcription [5]. The small molecule JQ1 is the first
generation of BET specific inhibitors which competitively

melanoma, as 85% of primary and metastatic UM carry
oncogenic mutations of G-protein α-subunits q or 11
[16,  17], and have a high tendency to metastasize to
the liver [18]. Recent efforts in the understanding of
the biology of UM have outlined therapies that target
mutant G-protein signaling [19]. Nevertheless, there is
a compelling need for effective therapeutic strategies
to manage this disease. UM are also characterized by
genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the
chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3,
which are significantly associated with poor prognosis
[20,  21]. The oncogene MYC is located on 8q24.1
and results amplified in nearly 40% of UM [22]. This
transcription factor is involved in the transcription of
genes regulating cell proliferation, cellular metabolism
and survival [23], and its elevated expression correlated
with larger tumor size of UM [22, 24].
In this study, we investigate the potential
therapeutic effect of the BET inhibitor JQ1 in UM
cells. We found that JQ1 induces cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis, especially in cells with Gnaq/11 mutations.
Using microarray analysis we identified a large set
of genes modulated by JQ1 that may account for the
differential effects observed in mutant versus wild-type
cells. In particular, genes involved in the regulation
of apoptosis and DNA repair seem to play role in UM
tumor growth. These observations support the evidence
that BET inhibition represent a promising therapeutic
approach for UM with Gnaq/11 mutations.

functional in these cells. The exception was the cutaneous
melanoma cell line C8161, in which c-Myc expression
was slightly inhibited.
Next, we tested the effect of the BET inhibitor JQ1
on c-Myc expression. Treatment of the cells with 500 nM
JQ1 for 24 hours showed suppression of c-Myc in all the
cell lines (Figure 1C), demonstrating target inhibition of
this oncogene.
We next screened the cell lines for sensitivity to JQ1
treatments in viability assays.
Most cell lines showed reduced viability with
increasing doses of JQ1 (Figure 2A). However, the
cells with Gnaq/11 mutations were the most sensitive
to the treatments with IC50 of 100–250 nM, suggesting
a dependency on functional BET proteins. Surprisingly,
the MYC-amplified cell line Mel290 was not as sensitive,
and the cells without G-protein mutation or MYC
amplification, Mel285 and C8161, were the least sensitive
to JQ1 with IC50 values well above 2000 nM.
We further investigated the effect of JQ1 on the
cell lines with different mutational status by analyzing
cell cycle progression. All four cell lines underwent cell
cycle arrest in G1 (Figure 2B), while a marked apoptotic
sub-G1 peak appeared in the Gnaq mutant cells after
48 and 72 hours of treatment. No sub-G1 was detected in
the WT cells at any time point. The induction of apoptosis
was also measured with a membrane permeability assay
after 48 hour treatment (Figure 2C). Only the Gnaqmutant cell lines (92.1 and Omm1.3) underwent apoptosis
with increased permeability of 43.6% and 33% of the cell
population, respectively. Finally, apoptosis was detected in
the Gnaq mutant cells by the induction of cleaved PARP,
an apoptotic marker, after 48 and 72 hours of treatment
(Figure 2D, upper panel), while no PARP cleavage was
induced in the WT cells at any time point (Figure 2D,
lower panel).
Thus, JQ1 regulates c-Myc expression in all UM
cell lines, but triggers apoptosis only in a subset of cell
lines, specifically cells carrying Gnaq/11 mutations.
Mutant Gnaq and Gna11 proteins have long been
known to activate downstream signaling targets, including
MEK, PI3-kinase/Akt and protein kinase C, and the
combination of specific inhibitors of these pathways
were reported to effectively block proliferation of UM
cells [26–29]. We tested whether JQ1 had combinatory
effects with specific inhibitors of MEK (selumetinib),
PKC (sotrastaurin) or AKT (MK2206). The viability
of cells treated with various concentrations of JQ1,
alone or in combination with each drug (0 to 2000
nM) was evaluated in two Gnaq-mutant cell lines. The
combinatorial treatments were analyzed with the ChouTalalay method [30] and found not synergistic with either
drug. Each combination had a “fractional activity” (Fa)
< 0.5 and combination index (CI) values > 1. Viability
graphs using equimolar concentrations of each drug are
shown in Supplemental Figure S1. This data suggests

RESULTS
JQ1 inhibits viability of UM cells
We first analyzed the status of MYC in UM cells
by FISH analysis, and found that several cell lines had
extra copies of MYC, and the cell line Mel290 had true
MYC amplification. Furthermore, four cell lines carried
Gnaq mutation (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202), one
cell line carried Gna11 mutation (Omm1), while Mel285
and Mel290 had neither mutation, designed as wildtype (WT). We also included a cutaneous melanoma
cell line, C8161, which has extra copies of MYC, and
no Gnaq/11 mutations [25]. These cell lines were tested
for expression of BRD4 and BRD2 by real- time PCR.
Figure 1A shows that the level of expression of these
two genes was similar in the Gnaq/11 mutant cell
lines, while it varied among the non-mutant cells, with
lower expression in Mel290 and C8161, and high RNA
expression of both genes in Mel285.
In order to test whether BRD4 is active and regulates
expression of c-Myc in these cells, BRD4 was knocked
down by siRNA transfection, and c-Myc was analyzed by
immunoblotting. Despite the differences in BRD4 mRNA
expression, BRD4 silencing suppressed c-Myc protein
in all the cell lines (Figure 1B), suggesting that BRD4 is

inhibitor would not improve JQ1 efficacy in vitro.

number of genes were regulated by JQ1 in the Gnaq/11
mutant cells, suggesting that BRD4 is particularly active
in these cells lines.
To explore the biological relevance of differentially
regulated genes in the Gnaq/11 mutant cells, we performed
pathway analysis by Ingenuity (Figure 3B), which
revealed several genes implicated in the regulation of
cell cycle (i.e. CCNE1, MYC, WEE1, E2F3, CDKN2D),
regulation of apoptosis (BCL2L1, FOXO1), and DNA
damage response (BRCA1, RAD51, CHEK1). Several
genes were similarly regulated by JQ1 in both Gnaq/11mutant and WT cells, like BCL2L11 (BIM), CDKN1A
(p21/Cip1) and BIRC5. JQ1 treatment also affected genes
involved in MAPK signaling (DUSP4, ELK) and PI3K/
AKT pathway (PIK3CB, AKT1, FOXO3).

involved in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis
and DNA repair response
In order to investigate the effect of BRD4
inhibition on gene expression, we performed
transcriptional analysis of seven UM cell lines and one
cutaneous melanoma cell line with different G protein
mutational status. The cells were treated with DMSO
or 500 nM JQ1 for 24 hours, and profiled by gene
expression microarrays.
The analysis of significant differentially expressed
genes (p ≤ 0.05) identified 5365 transcripts that were
regulated by JQ1 in Gnaq/11-mutant cells, while
2100 genes were regulated in the WT cells. This
analysis included both up- and down-regulated genes.

(c-Myc, Wee1), and the DNA damage response (Rad51
and Brca1) for further analysis. The regulation of
these genes by JQ1 was confirmed at the protein level
by immunoblotting following drug exposure for up
to 72 hours. There was nearly complete inhibition of
the proteins tested in cells with Gnaq/11 mutations
(Figure 3C, top panel), while no inhibition was detected
in the WT cell lines C8161 and Mel285 (Figure 3C,
lower panel). The MYC-amplified cell line Mel290 was
the exception, as most genes were also down-regulated,
while Bcl-xL was not affected by the drug (Figure 3C).
In order to determine whether any of these genes
could mediate the apoptotic effects of JQ1, each gene was
silenced by siRNA. Knockdown of single genes, including
c-Myc, did not inhibit cell viability or induce apoptosis in
the Gnaq-mutant cell line 92.1 (Figure 4A) and Omm1.3
(Supplemental Figure S2A and S2B). Surprisingly, the
concomitant depletion of Bcl-xL and Rad51 significantly
decreased viability of the cell lines 92.1 (Figure 4A) and
Omm1.3 (Supplemental Figure S2B). In contrast, silencing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Bcl-xL together with c-Myc, Brca1 or Wee1 had no
effect. The downregulation of each protein is shown in
Figure 4B, and induction of PARP cleavage is detected
only when Bcl-xL and Rad51 siRNA were combined,
reproducing JQ1 effects.
In the MYC-amplified cell line Mel290, the
depletion of c-Myc partially inhibited cell proliferation
with no induction of apoptosis, similar to JQ1 treatment
(Figure 4C). In contrast, Bcl-xL silencing alone or
together with other gene-specific siRNA, induced a
significant decrease in cell viability and PARP cleavage
(Figure 4C and 4D).
None of these effects were detected in the WT cell
line Mel285 with either siRNA transfection (Supplemental
Figure S3A and S3B).
The induction of apoptosis by Bcl-xL and Rad51
depletion was also confirmed by using a different set
of siRNA in the cell lines 92.1 and Mel290, obtaining
a similar induction of apoptosis by PARP cleavage
(Supplemental Figure S4).

Thus, Bcl-xL seems to play a role in cell survival
of Gnaq/11-mutant and MYC-amplified cell lines, while
c-Myc did not mediate the apoptotic effects of JQ1.
These findings would also suggest that although JQ1
inhibits expression of numerous genes, the concomitant
down-regulation of Bcl-xL and Rad51 is the minimal
requirement for inducing apoptosis in UM cells with Gnaq
mutation.
We sought to evaluate the importance of these genes
in a comparable tumor, such as cutaneous melanoma with
BRAF-mutation. The cell lines SK-Mel19 and SK-Mel29,
carrying BRAFV600E mutation, showed sensitivity to JQ1
in viability assays (Figure 5A) similar to UM Gnaqmutant cells, with IC50 of 125–500 nM. JQ1 treatments
also induced PARP cleavage and decreased the expression
of c-Myc, Rad51, Brca1 and Wee1 in both cell lines,
while Bcl-xL slightly decreased only in SK-Mel19
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 5B). Silencing of the indicated genes (Figure 5C)
did not induce inhibition of viability (Figure 5D), and the
concomitant suppression of Bcl-xL and Rad51 had partial
effects that were not statistically significant. These results
suggest that genes like Rad51 and Bcl-xL specifically
regulate UM cell survival, while in melanoma cells
JQ1-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated by other
mechanisms [32].

expression at the promoter region in Gnaqmutant cells
Bcl-xL was identified in the microarray analysis
among the genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, and
it was exclusively down-regulated by JQ1 in the Gnaq/11

Bcl-xL are highly expressed in UM, and their inhibition had
antitumor activity [33]. Moreover, Rad51 was reported to
have increased activity in cancer cells compared to normal
cells [34]. Therefore, Bcl-xL and Rad51 may represent
important mediators of cell survival in UM, and the
expression of both genes is disrupted by BRD4 targeting.
To confirm suppression of the mRNA levels
of these genes by JQ1, quantitative RT-PCR was
performed  in Gnaq/11-mutant and WT cells before
and after JQ1 treatment. Bcl-xL was significantly
suppressed in the Gnaq/11-mutant cells (Figure 6A, and
Supplemental Figure S5A), while its basal expression
was much higher in the WT cell lines Mel285 and
C6181, and minimally affected by JQ1. The MYCamplified cell line Mel290 had low levels of Bcl-xL
mRNA and the decrease induced by JQ1 was not
significant (Figure 6A). Rad51 was also markedly downregulated by JQ1 in the Gnaq/11-mutant cells (Figure
6B and Supplemental Figure S5B), while no significant
inhibition was detected in all WT cells.

Next, we asked whether Bcl-xL and Rad51
promoters were directly regulated by BRD4. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP), we found
that BRD4 was enriched at the Bcl-xL promoter in the
Gnaq-mutant cells (Figure 6C), and the treatment with JQ1
diminished this binding. In contrast, there was minimal
binding to the Bcl-xL promoter in the WT cell lines, and
JQ1 did not change it. A similar displacement of BRD4
binding by JQ1 was found at the Rad51 promoter in the
mutant cells (Figure 6D), but not in the WT cells.
Finally, we sought to demonstrate that BRD4
depletion could specifically down-regulate these two
proteins. BRD4 silencing caused a decrease of both Bcl-xL
and Rad51 expression in the Gnaq-mutant cells (Figure 6E).
Instead, BRD4 depletion caused a slight decrease in Rad51,
but not Bcl-xL, in the Mel290 WT cells. No changes were
detected in Mel285, suggesting that Bcl-xL and Rad51 are
regulated by other mechanisms in these cells.
Taken together these data indicate that BRD4 is
required for Bcl-xL and Rad51 expression, and JQ1

Because JQ1 caused down-regulation of Bcl-xL and
Rad51, we assessed whether the overexpression of these
two proteins could protect UM cells from JQ1. Bcl-xL was
ectopically expressed alone or together with Rad51 in the
mutant cells, and protein levels are shown in Figure 7A.
Neither Bcl-xL nor Rad51 alone could rescue cells from
JQ1 treatment in cell viability assays (Figure 7B). However,
when both constructs were expressed there was a significant
increase in cell survival in the presence of JQ1 (Figure 7B),
which also corresponded to a decrease of cleaved PARP
(Figure 7A).
Although numerous genes are affected by JQ1, our
results suggest that these two proteins play an important role
in mediating BET-mediated regulation of UM survival.

using a Gnaq-mutant cell line. JQ1 was administered
orally at 35 mg/kg, five times a week for three weeks. The
dose was well tolerated as no body weight loss due to the
treatment was detected up to a month from the first dose.
Tumor growth was inhibited in the treated mice compared
to vehicle (Figure 8A), and this inhibition was significant
after 21 days of treatment (p < 0.05). In addition,
immunoblotting of proteins from tumors collected at the
end of the treatments showed down-regulation of Bcl-xL
and Rad51 (Figure 8B). We could also detect induction of
apoptosis by PARP cleavage, confirming the effects of JQ1
observed in UM cell lines in vitro.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have demonstrated that extra copies
of MYC are present in UM [22, 35], which would predict
sensitivity to BRD4 inhibition.
Here we report that the BET inhibitor JQ1 induces
cell cycle arrest in a panel of genetically diverse UM, and
it has potent cytotoxic effects only in cells with Gnaq/11
mutations, irrespective of MYC status. Transcriptional

to regulation by JQ1, compared to cells without Gnaq/11
mutations. A subset of these genes, selected from
canonical pathway enrichment analysis and common to all
mutant cell lines, was further analyzed by gene silencing.
These studies determined that the suppression of each
gene, including c-Myc, was insufficient to mimic the
apoptotic effects of JQ1. Rather, the concomitant depletion
of Bcl-xL and Rad51 induced apoptosis similar to JQ1,
suggesting that the simultaneous regulation of multiple
effectors is necessary for the induction of apoptosis in
these cells. While the down-regulation of both genes
represented the minimal requirement to mimic JQ1
effects, we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes
may be responsible for mediating the apoptotic effects
of BET inhibition, as JQ1 treatment led to down- and
up-regulation of numerous genes with potential roles in
tumorigenesis and cell survival. Given the high incidence
of MYC amplification in UM and its correlation with larger
tumor size [24], c-Myc targeting may still represent a
possible strategy to manage this disease.
Interestingly, Bcl-xL was downregulated by JQ1
only in the Gnaq/11-mutant cells, but not in the less
sensitive WT cells. Although Bcl-xL was slightly downregulated by JQ1 in one BRAF-mutant cell line, it did
not seem to play a role in mediating the apoptotic effects
of JQ1 in these cells. On the other hand, knockdown of
Bcl-xL was sufficient to induce cell death in the MYCamplified cell line, confirming that Bcl-xL expression is
critical for UM survival. Regulation of Bcl-xL by JQ1 was
also reported in glioblastoma [12], and its over-expression
partially rescued cells from JQ1-induced apoptosis.
Recent studies have identified other important
targets of JQ1, such as FosL1 in lung cancer cell lines
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[11], or IL7R in lymphoblastic leukemia [10]. The
cytotoxic effects of bromodomain inhibition reported
in cutaneous melanoma cells were independent of the
mutational status of BRAF or NRAS [14]. This is in
contrast with the effect of JQ1 in UM cell lines, where
the induction of apoptosis was dependent on Gnaq/11
mutations, suggesting that these cells rely on BRD4
activity for the regulation of gene transcription. This is of
particular interest, as nearly 85% of UM carry Gnaq/11
mutations, and BRD4 inhibition could translate in targeted
therapies for the majority of UM.
The regulation of DNA repair genes such as Rad51
by JQ1 also contributed to the survival of cells with Gnaq
mutation. BRD4 was recruited to the promoter of Rad51
and Bcl-xL, and was displaced by JQ1 in the mutant cells,
confirming regulation of expression of this gene by BETproteins. The differential effects of JQ1 in the genetically
diverse UM could have several plausible explanations.
Although BRD4 is a ubiquitous regulator, it also has genespecific effects due to the presence of super-enhancer in
tumor cells. The enhancers function through cooperative
and synergistic interactions between multiple transcription
factors and coactivators [36, 37], which confer increased
transcription of target genes and higher sensitivity to
specific inhibitors. Further investigation will be required to
determine whether these mechanisms are responsible for
the differential binding of BRD4 to chromatin in different
tumors and cell lines.
BET inhibitors have been reported to have cytostatic
effects in several tumor types, requiring combinations
with other drugs to induce synergistic effects [32, 38]. In
contrast, drug combinations may not be necessary for the
treatment of Gnaq/11-mutant UM, as JQ1 caused marked
33405

Oncotarget

cell death as single agent, and the combinations with other
small molecules targeting mutant Gnaq signaling did not
have synergistic effects.
A number of BET bromodomain inhibitors are now
under development, and some of them (i.e. OTX015 and
GSK525762) are in phase I clinical studies. These drugs have
shown gene expression signature with a large overlap with
JQ1 expression profiling [12, 38, 39], and they may represent
effective therapies against UM in the clinical setting.
In summary, our results determine that BET
inhibition represents an effective therapy against UM
through the inhibition of cell cycle and induction of
apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. This data strongly supports
the rationale for the targeting of BRD4 in patients with
UM harboring Gnaq/11 mutations.

was assessed after four days of treatment using the
Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) from Dojindo Molecular
Technologies according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell viability is expressed as a percentage of
untreated cells. Flow cytometry of cells was performed
after staining with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide containing
50 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed on a FACScan
(Becton Dickinson), and data were analyzed for DNA
content using Flowjo software. Membrane permeability
and apoptosis were measured using the YO-PRO-1 Kit
(Life Technologies). Fluorescent cells were analyzed on
a Cellometer K2 (Nexcelom Bioscience) with De Novo
software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The cells were treated in triplicate with medium
containing 0.2% DMSO or 500 nM JQ1 for 24 hours.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasyMini
kit (Qiagen). Samples were profiled using the
genechip Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
(HG-U133 2.0, Affymetrix) using established protocols.
All statistical analyses were carried out in R using
packages provided within Bioconductor [41]. Data
were normalized using GC-RMA. Analysis of gene
expression was performed using the limma package
[42]. Differential gene expression was modelled using a
blocked linear model design to account for between cell
line effects, and correlation term to account for technical
replication within cell lines [42]. Three contrasts were
made to extract statistics for differential gene expression
due to the effect of treatment on the wild type cell lines,
the effect of treatment on the mutant cell lines and the
difference in the effect of treatment between mutant and
wild-type cell lines. False discovery rate (FDR) was
estimated using the method described by Benjamini and
Hochberg [43]. Statistical significance of gene expression
was determined at FDR ≤ 0.05. Gene lists of interest
were exported from R and analyzed for the enrichment
of biological pathways using Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis. Data is deposited at GEO accession no.

Microarray and statistical analysis

Cell lines and reagents
The cell lines Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202 were kindly
provided by Dr Bruce Ksander, Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA. 92.1 cells have been provided by Dr William
Harbour, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Omm1
and Mel285 were provided by Dr Boris Bastian, University
of California, San Francisco, CA. Mel290 and C8161 were
from Dr Robert Folberg (University of Illinois, Chicago,
IL). All the cell lines have been sequenced for the presence
of activating mutations in codons 209 (exon 5) and 183
(exon 4) of Gnaq and Gna11. C8161 cells were recently
characterized as cutaneous melanoma [25]. SK-Mel19 and
SK-Mel29 were a gift from Dr Taha Merghoub (Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Cells
were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2. FISH was
performed using red-labeled probe from PAC clone RP1–
80K22 spanning MYC in 8q24, together with green-labeled
centromeric probe (pJM128) as reference. FISH signals
were analyzed in a minimum of 10 metaphase spreads and
100 interphase nuclei. The cell lines 92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270
and Mel202 had extra copies of normal chromosomes 8,
and MYC was highly represented. This is consistent with
a previous analysis of the cell line 92.1 [40]. The cell
line C8161 showed two copies of an isochromosome for
8q, with probable matching loss of 8p, giving a total of 7
copies of MYC. Mel290 cells showed amplification of MYC.
Omm1 cells had normal MYC copy number. JQ1 was kindly
provided by Dr James Bradner (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). Selumetinib, sotrastaurin and MK2206 were
purchased from Selleck Chemicals.

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling)
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets
(Roche Diagnostics). Total protein concentration of the
lysates was measured by BCA assay (Bio-Rad), and equal
amounts of protein were loaded on 4–12% PAGE gels
(Life Biotechnologies). PVDF membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS buffer containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and probed with antibody for c-Myc, PARP,
Bcl-xL, Brca1, BRD4, tubulin (Cell Signaling), Rad51
and Wee1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals from
secondary antibodies were detected using ECL (Pierce)

Cell viability assays

or JQ1 35 mg/kg orally. The treatment duration was
3 weeks and the tumor size was measured twice a week.
After the fifth treatment, two animals from each cohort
were sacrificed and the tumors were collected for Western
blot analysis. Experiments were carried out under an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved
protocol, and Institutional guidelines for the proper
and humane use of animals were followed. Statistical
significance was determined by 2-sample Student t tests.

siRNA and plasmid transfections
Small interfering RNA against c-Myc (sc-29226),
Rad51 (sc-36361), Brca1 (sc-29219), Wee1 (sc-36835)
and control siRNA (sc-37007) were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bcl-xL siRNA was from Cell
Signaling (#6362), and siRNA-2 SMARTpool from
Dharmacon (L-004937–00). siRNA-2 for Rad51
(L-003530–00) and BRD4 (L-004937–00) were also from
Dharmacon. They were transfected using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies). Rad51 construct
[44] and Bcl-xL (OriGene) were transfected using Fugene
6 (Promega), following manufacturer’s instructions.
