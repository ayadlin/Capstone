Abstract
Recombinant plasminogen kringle 5 (rK5) has been shown to
induce apoptosis of dermal microvessel endothelial cells
(MvEC) in a manner that requires glucose-regulated protein
78 (GRP78). As we are interested in antiangiogenic therapy for
glioblastoma tumors, and the effectiveness of antiangiogenic
therapy can be enhanced when combined with radiation, we
investigated the proapoptotic effects of rK5 combined with
radiation on brain MvEC. We found that rK5 treatment of
brain MvEC induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent
manner and that prior irradiation significantly sensitized
(500-fold) the cells to rK5-induced apoptosis. The rK5-induced
apoptosis of both unirradiated and irradiated MvEC required
expression of GRP78 and the low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 1 (LRP1), a scavenger receptor, based on
down-regulation studies with small interfering RNA, and
blocking studies with either a GRP78 antibody or a competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1. Furthermore, p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase was found to be a necessary
downstream effector for rK5-induced apoptosis. These data
suggest that irradiation sensitizes brain MvEC to the rK5induced apoptosis and that this signal requires LRP1
internalization of GRP78 and the activation of p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase. Our findings suggest that prior
irradiation would have a dose-sparing effect on rK5 antiangiogenic therapy for brain tumors and further suggest that
the effects of rK5 would be tumor specific, as the expression of
GRP78 protein is up-regulated on the brain MvEC in
glioblastoma tumor biopsies compared with the normal brain.

Introduction
Glioblastoma tumors have a dismal prognosis with a median
survival of 12 to 15 months. As the tumors typically exhibit
angiogenesis (1–3), antiangiogenic therapy may represent an
effective therapeutic strategy. In this study, we investigated the
proapoptotic effect of the recombinant form of the fifth kringle
domain of plasminogen (rK5) on human brain microvessel
endothelial cells (MvEC). Irradiation is known to promote the

ability of other antiangiogenic agents to inhibit tumor growth (4–6)
and irradiation is a standard initial therapy for patients with
glioblastoma tumors (2); therefore, we also investigated the
potential promotion of rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC by
irradiation.
It has been shown previously that rK5 induces changes
indicative of apoptosis in nonbrain MvEC (7, 8) and inhibits
proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated calf
pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and bovine adrenal capillary
endothelial cells (8, 9). The ability of rK5 to inhibit neovascularization has been shown directly in a rat model of hyperoxia-induced
retinal neovascularization (10). Moreover, stable expression of K5
in U-87MG glioblastoma cells before their subcutaneous propagation in nude mice resulted in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor
growth (11) and inhibition of angiogenesis was seen when
colorectal carcinoma cells stably expressing K5 were propagated
subcutaneously in athymic nude mice (12).
The cell surface binding protein for rK5 on dermal MvEC is
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78; ref. 7). GRP78 is a member of
the heat shock protein (HSP) 70 family, and its up-regulation is part
of the general cellular defense mechanism of stressed cells called
the unfolded protein response (reviewed in refs. 13, 14). The
increased expression of members of the unfolded protein response
in tumors suggests that they may be promising therapeutic targets
(reviewed in ref. 15). GRP78 associates with the scavenger receptor
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the
cell surface (16). LRP1 is known to signal upon associating with
and internalizing its ligands (17–20). The biological consequences
of its internalization are varied and depend on 1 of f30 different
ligands it binds (reviewed in refs. 21–23) as well as its association
with other cell surface proteins, the cell type, and the experimental
conditions (16, 20, 24, 25). As the rK5 inhibition of retinal capillary
endothelial cell proliferation was unaffected by RGD-containing
peptides (10), it likely occurs in an integrin receptor-independent
manner.
We found that rK5 induces apoptosis of brain MvEC and that
prior irradiation significantly sensitizes the cells to rK5-induced
apoptosis resulting in a dose-sparing effect. In both unirradiated
and irradiated brain MvEC, the rK5-induced apoptosis requires
expression of GRP78 and LRP1 as well as the activation of p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).

receptor-associated protein was purchased from Maine Biotechnology
Services and dialyzed before use.
Cell culture. Primary human brain MvEC were purchased from Cell
Systems, used at passages 2 to 8, and propagated as recommended in 70%
CSC medium and 30% M199 medium, with 10% low-endotoxin fetal bovine
serum (FBS; BD Biosciences). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were split
the day before the experiment and then replated onto collagen-coated wells
in M199 medium with 10% low-endotoxin FBS, 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast
growth factor, and 10 ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
4 h before treatment with rK5. Cells were subconfluent at the time of
treatment.
Analysis of cell surface expression. For analysis of the cell surface
expression of GRP78 and LRP1, cells were labeled with biotin (26), lysed in
1% NP-40 lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris, 137 mmol/L NaCl, and 2 mmol/L
EDTA (pH 8.0) with 10% glycerol and with protease inhibitors],
immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody anti-LRP1 or goat antiGRP78 IgG, the immunoprecipitates harvested by centrifugation, washed,
subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane, reacted
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and developed using
chemiluminescence (Amersham). Alternatively, cells were incubated with
10 Ag/mL primary antibody (30 min, 4jC), washed, incubated with
10 Ag/mL Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (30 min, 4jC), washed,
fixed, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a
FACScan instrument as described previously (27). Goat anti-GRP78
(directed toward the NH2 and COOH termini) was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology and monoclonal antibody anti-LRP1 was from
Calbiochem.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells and tissue samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer [0.05 mol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
0.15 mol/L NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS] with
protease inhibitors as described previously (28). Equivalent amounts of
lysate (typically 100-130 Ag) were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to an
Immobilon-P membrane, probed with primary antibody (4jC, overnight),
washed, reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (Bio-Rad), and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham; ref. 28). Antibodies were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-p38
MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Y182), anti-HSP70, anti-c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK), and anti-calreticulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 or -7 (Calbiochem); rabbit anti-von Willebrand
factor IgG (Chemicon); monoclonal antibody anti-actin (Sigma); mouse
anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); and monoclonal antibody anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Research Diagnostics).
Small interfering RNA down-regulation. SMARTpool small interfering
RNA (siRNA) consisting of a pool of four SMARTselection-designed siRNA
duplexes directed toward GRP78, HSP70, calreticulin, p38 MAPK, and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 were purchased from
Dharmacon, and siRNA directed toward LRP1 was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. HP-validated siRNA directed toward JNK2 was
purchased from Qiagen. Two nonsense mutations were introduced into
the JNK2 siRNA sequence as a custom control purchased from Qiagen.
Transient transfections were carried out using the HiPerFect Transfection
Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The addition
of liposome without siRNA was administered in control conditions.
Apoptosis assays. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays were carried out using the
ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously (28). Tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) induction of apoptosis was used as a positive
control (29). For determination of caspase-3/7 activity, a caspase-3/7
luminescent activity assay was done using the Caspase-Glo-3/7 Assay kit
(Promega).
Analysis of human tissue samples. Tissue samples were obtained from
the Cooperative Human Tissue Network of the National Cancer Institute
and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Brain Tumor Bank in
accordance with University Human Tissue Committee policies. Tumors
were histologically graded according to the WHO classification of brain
tumors (1). Frozen normal adult brain (cortex and white matter) and

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (13). July 1, 2009

glioblastoma tumor samples obtained at autopsy within 18 h of death were
homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer with protease
inhibitors as described (30) for Western blot analysis. For immunohistochemical analysis, frozen sections, as well as formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded, normal brain and glioblastoma tumor samples were prepared
from surgical biopsy samples and treated with blocking buffer to inhibit
endogenous peroxidases and prevent nonspecific protein binding, reacted
with the primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS/0.01% Tween
20 (4jC, 20 h), washed, reacted with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody (22jC, 1 h) followed by the 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine
substrate (ScyTek; ref. 30), and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Statistics. After determining the data were normally distributed, a twosample t test was used for data analysis and P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
rK5 induces apoptosis of primary human brain MvEC. rK5
treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC (7).
To determine the potential of rK5 treatment to induce apoptosis of
brain MvEC, we treated primary human brain MvEC plated onto
collagen type IV and grown in complete medium (10% FBS) in the
presence of VEGF (10 ng/mL) and basic fibroblast growth factor
(5 ng/mL) with rK5 at concentrations of 1 to 10,000 ng/mL for 17 h.
We found that 5,000 ng/mL rK5 was necessary to induce a
significant increase in the numbers of TUNEL-positive human
brain MvEC (8% positive) at 17 h (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting
analysis as well as caspase-3/7 activity analysis confirmed that
treatment of the cells with 5,000 ng/mL rK5 for 17 h resulted in a
significant increase in cleaved caspase-7 and that treatment for
periods greater than 17 h (25 and 40 h) did not result in a further
increase in the amounts of cleaved caspase-7 (data not shown).
Irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to rK5induced apoptosis. To evaluate the effect of prior irradiation on
rK5-induced apoptosis of brain MvEC, we irradiated (2 or 5 Gy)
primary human brain MvEC, allowed the cells to recover for 20 h,
and replated them onto collagen-coated wells for 4 h before
treatment with rK5 for 17 h. In the absence of treatment with rK5,
only a low percentage of brain MvEC that were irradiated exhibited
TUNEL positivity (Fig. 1B). Notably, the percentage of TUNELpositive cells in the brain MvEC that had been irradiated before
treatment with 10 ng/mL rK5 was similar to the percentage of
TUNEL-positive cells in unirradiated MvEC that were treated with
5,000 ng/mL rK5 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the prior irradiation appeared to
increase the sensitivity of the cells to rK5, the irradiation had a
dose-sparing effect, but did not seem to increase the numbers of
cells that were susceptible to rK5. Similarly, irradiation of the brain
MvEC (2 or 5 Gy) followed by rK5 treatment (3-5,000 ng/mL, 17 h)
resulted in a significant increase in the cleavage of caspase-3 or -7
that was maximal at 10 ng/mL rK5 (Fig. 1C; data not shown),
confirming that irradiation plus rK5 induces apoptosis. Consistent
with the results of the TUNEL assays, irradiation alone (5 Gy) did
not induce a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The time course of rK5-induced caspase-7 cleavage
in the irradiated brain MvEC was maximal at 17 h and detectable
as early as 3 h post-rK5 treatment (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these data
establish that prior irradiation of the brain MvEC resulted in a
significant reduction in the dose of rK5 required for optimal
induction of apoptosis.

the expression of GRP78 on the cell surface of the MvEC used in the

Kringle 5 Induces Apoptosis of Brain MvEC

Figure 1. Irradiation sensitizes primary human brain MvEC to rK5-induced
apoptosis. A, primary human brain MvEC plated on collagen type IV in
M199 medium with 10% FBS, 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, and
10 ng/mL VEGF were treated with rK5 (or vehicle) for 17 h and then subjected
to a TUNEL assay. B to D, primary human brain MvEC cultured as
described above were irradiated, allowed to recover for 20 h, and replated onto
collagen-coated wells in fresh medium (4 h) followed by treatment with rK5
or vehicle for 17 h or for the indicated times and then subjected to a TUNEL
assay (B) or detergent lysis, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with the indicated
antibodies (C and D ). TNF-a induction of apoptosis was used as a positive
control in the TUNEL assays.

analyses of rK5-induced apoptosis was determined by cell surface
biotinylation followed by detergent lysis, immunoprecipitation with
anti-GRP78 antibody, and SDS-PAGE analysis. The data indicated
that GRP78 was expressed on both unirradiated and irradiated
human brain MvEC (Fig. 2A). Although irradiation has been
reported to up-regulate GRP78 (31), we found that the surface
expression was equivalent in the irradiated and unirradiated brain
MvEC (Fig. 2A), suggesting that an up-regulation of GRP78 does not
contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of the irradiated brain MvEC
to low doses of rK5 in our experiments.
After further confirming the cell surface expression of GRP78 on
the brain MvEC by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
(data not shown), we determined the requirement for GRP78 in
rK5-induced apoptosis by down-regulating GRP78 with specific
duplex siRNA. As a control, we down-regulated the endoplasmic
reticulum chaperone protein calreticulin, which is expressed, in
part, on the cell surface (19), or we down-regulated HSP70. Downregulation of GRP78 and calreticulin was confirmed by Western
blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and we have established
previously that HSP70 protein is down-regulated by >70% with
50 nmol/L siHSP70 treatment in the unirradiated human brain
MvEC (data not shown). No adverse effects of the siRNAs on cell
viability or morphology were detected over the time course of these
experiments (data not shown). The down-regulation of GRP78
significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis (5,000 ng/mL; 17 h) of
the unirradiated brain MvEC as determined using a TUNEL assay
and blotting for cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2B), whereas the downregulation of calreticulin or HSP70 had no effect.
Similar results were obtained on down-regulation of GRP78 in
irradiated cells. Down-regulation of GRP78 (>70%) was achieved on
treatment of the irradiated brain MvEC with 50 nmol/L siGRP78
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Down-regulation of GRP78 in the
irradiated brain MvEC significantly blocked rK5-induced apoptosis
(10 ng/mL rK5; 17 h) as detected using the TUNEL assay and
blotting for cleaved caspase-7 (Fig. 2C). The down-regulation of
HSP70 had no effect. Further support for a role for GRP78 in rK5induced apoptosis of the irradiated brain MvEC was obtained by
the results of treatment with an anti-GRP78 antibody (10 Ag/mL)
that is directed toward the NH2 terminus. This inhibited rK5induced apoptosis (data not shown) as described previously for
unirradiated dermal MvEC (7). These data indicate that GRP78 is
necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of both unirradiated and
irradiated primary human brain MvEC.
LRP1 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of unirradiated
and irradiated human brain MvEC. GRP78 is known to associate
with LRP1 on the cell surface (16); therefore, we examined the
potential role of LRP1 in rK5-induced apoptosis of MvEC. The
expression of LRP1 on the cell surface was verified using cell
surface biotinylation followed by detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody anti-LRP1, which recognizes
the 85-kDa light chain. SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates indicated that LRP1 is expressed on the surface of both
unirradiated and irradiated MvEC and further indicated the levels
of expression of LRP1 on the cell surface were not altered by
irradiation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To determine whether LRP1
is required for the rK5-induced apoptosis of the human brain
MvEC, we pretreated the cells with receptor-associated protein, a
competitive inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP1 (32). Prior addition
of 60 nmol/L recombinant receptor-associated protein blocked
rK5-induced apoptosis in the irradiated and unirradiated cells as
detected using the TUNEL assay and cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 3A

Figure 2. GRP78 is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of human brain MvEC. A, unirradiated and irradiated primary human brain MvEC (plated and treated as
described in Fig. 1) were surface biotinylated 24 h post-irradiation, detergent lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-GRP78 antibody, and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
B, unirradiated primary human brain MvEC were treated with siRNA for 48 h, replated onto collagen-coated wells in fresh medium, and subjected to a TUNEL assay or

had no effect (Fig. 3C). In the unirradiated cells, down-regulation
of LRP1 significantly blocked the rK5-induced apoptosis
(5,000 ng/mL), whereas the down-regulation of calreticulin had
no effect (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that LRP1 internalization of
GRP78 is likely necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis in both
irradiated and the unirradiated brain MvEC.
p38 MAPK is necessary for rK5-induced apoptosis of the
irradiated human brain MvEC. Stress is known to induce the
activation of p38 MAPK (33) and p38 MAPK can promote a

proapoptotic signal (34–36). We found a time-dependent increase
in phosphorylated p38 MAPK in the irradiated cells treated with
rK5 (Fig. 4A). Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of p38
MAPK (SB202190) at 2.5-fold the IC50 (1.5 Amol/L) significantly
blocked the proapoptotic effect of rK5 in the irradiated brain MvEC
(Fig. 4B). In contrast, the proapoptotic effects of rK5 were not
blocked by treatment with inhibitors of other kinases at 2.5-fold the
IC50: 5 Amol/L PD98059 (MEK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor),
and FR180204 (ERK inhibitor; Fig. 4B). To further evaluate the

requirement for p38 MAPK in the irradiated MvEC, we downregulated p38 MAPK with pooled specific duplex siRNA and downregulated ERK1 as a control (Supplementary Fig. S3A). TUNEL
analysis indicated that the down-regulation of p38 MAPK in the

irradiated brain MvEC blocked the proapoptotic effect of rK5
(Fig. 4C), whereas the down-regulation of ERK1 had no effect.
On analysis of the unirradiated cells, we also found that the p38
MAPK inhibitor SB202190 at 2.5-fold the IC50 significantly blocked
the proapoptotic effect of rK5 (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3), whereas the
ERK inhibitor FR180204 did not (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 4). Similarly,
down-regulation of p38 MAPK in the unirradiated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B) blocked the proapoptotic effect of rK5 as
detected by TUNEL assay, whereas the down-regulation of ERK1
had no significant effect (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that p38
MAPK is a necessary downstream signaling effector in the
proapoptotic effect of rK5 in irradiated and unirradiated human
brain MvEC.
Although JNK has been reported to be involved in signaling that
promotes apoptosis (34), we found that the JNK inhibitor,
SP600125, at 2.5-fold the IC50 in the irradiated cells (Fig. 4B) or
the unirradiated cells (Fig. 5A) did not block the proapoptotic
effect of rK5. However, a small increase (30%) in phosphorylation of
the 54-kDa JNK2 isoform was detected in a time course analysis of
JNK phosphorylation post-rK5 treatment of the unirradiated cells
(data not shown). Down-regulation of JNK2 with 200 nmol/L
specific duplex siJNK2 RNA (70% down-regulation of the 54-kDa
isoform) followed by TUNEL assay confirmed that down-regulation
of JNK2 in the unirradiated cells did not block the proapoptotic
effect of rK5 (5,000 ng/mL; data not shown).
GRP78 expression is higher on brain MvEC in glioblastoma
tumor samples compared with the normal brain. As our
ultimate goal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for
glioblastoma tumors, we evaluated the expression of GRP78 in
frozen and paraffin sections of 14 glioblastoma tumor biopsy
samples by immunohistochemistry. We found moderate (2+)
expression of GRP78 in an estimated 30% of MvEC in the tumor
portion of all glioblastoma samples (n = 14) and moderate (2+)
expression in 30% of tumor cells (Fig. 6A). The staining localized to
the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. The staining was specific for
GRP78, as it was largely competed out by preincubation of the antiGRP78 antibody with a 50-fold molar excess of GRP78 peptide
(data not shown). Staining with rabbit IgG was used as a negative
control and staining with anti-von Willebrand factor antibody was
used as a positive control. Using this technique, GRP78 expression
was below the limit of detection in endothelial and glial cells in the
frozen and paraffin sections of normal brain (n = 13), although low
(1+) expression of GRP78 was detected in neurons in the normal
brain (data not shown). To confirm the up-regulation of GRP78 in
the tumors compared with the normal brain, we immunoblotted
lysates from nine normal brains and nine glioblastoma tumor
samples with anti-GRP78 antibody followed by stripping and
reprobing with antibodies directed toward GAPDH and HSP70. The
immunoblotting data were quantitated by densitometric analysis
and GRP78 expression was normalized to HSP70 and to GAPDH

normal brain mean = 0.36 F 0.05 and glioblastoma multiforme

Discussion
In this report, we show that rK5 can induce apoptosis of brain
MvEC and that irradiation significantly sensitizes primary human
brain MvEC to the proapoptotic effect of rK5. We found that
rK5 treatment of brain MvEC induces apoptosis, as measured
by several different assays, when administered at 5,000 ng/mL
(500 nmol/L). This is similar to the dosage of rK5 required to
induce apoptosis of dermal MvEC (7). Importantly, we found that
prior irradiation significantly sensitized the brain MvEC to rK5induced apoptosis, as a 500-fold lower dose of rK5 (10 ng/mL)
induced a similar percentage of TUNEL-positive cells and cleavage
of caspase-3 or -7.
Few studies have focused on irradiation as a potential sensitizing
agent for antiangiogenic therapy. Our studies are consistent with
the recent report of Jin and colleagues (37) that rK5 combined with
irradiation enhanced the antiangiogenic effect of rK5 in a mouse
tumor model of Lewis lung carcinoma cells propagated subcutaneously. Under our experimental conditions (10% FBS with 10 ng/mL
VEGF and 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor), irradiation alone
did not induce significant cell death or caspase-3/7 cleavage. Other
investigators have reported a proapoptotic effect of irradiation (2 or
5 Gy) alone on dermal MvEC that were propagated and radiated in
reduced serum (2% FBS), and this was attributed to reduced levels
of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 (38, 39). We did not find an
altered level of Bcl2 protein post-irradiation of the MvEC at two
time points in our experimental conditions.5 This may be due to
the higher levels of FBS and added VEGF, as the level of Bcl2
expression is known to be regulated by VEGF (39) or it may reflect
the use of brain MvEC rather than dermal MvEC. rK5 has been
reported to induce autophagy of nonbrain endothelial cells in
different experimental conditions (40); therefore, it is possible that
rK5-induced autophagy contributes to the apoptosis we have
observed in the brain MvEC.
Our finding that GRP78 is required for rK5-induced apoptosis of
human brain MvEC is consistent with the report of the requirement
for GRP78 in the proapoptotic effect of rK5 on dermal MvEC, and
of a direct interaction of rK5 with recombinant GRP78 (7). GRP78 is
an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein that is expressed on
the cell surface in stress conditions and in tumors (14, 15); however,
we found no change in the cell surface expression post-irradiation
in the time course and conditions of our experiments. This
suggests that an increase in GRP78 expression post-irradiation is
not the mechanism by which irradiation sensitizes the cells to rK5induced apoptosis. The ligand binding to cell surface GRP78
appears to determine the signal generated. We and others (7)

detect a proapoptotic signal when rK5 binds to cell surface GRP78
on MvEC, whereas a2-macroglobulin binding to cell surface GRP78
on human prostate cancer cells and macrophages initiates a proproliferation signal (41). The voltage-dependent ion channel also
has been reported to be a receptor for rK5 (42).
We found that LRP1 is necessary for the rK5-generated
proapoptotic signal. This suggests that LRP1 internalization of
GRP78 is likely necessary for the proapoptotic effect of rK5 in the
brain MvEC. The signal generated upon LRP1 binding and
internalizing its ligand is dependent on the cell and the
environmental context (21). For example, a promigratory signal is
generated when LRP1 binds and internalizes the complex of cell

rK5 or vehicle for 17 h as described in Fig. 1, followed by detergent lysis and
blotting with the indicated antibodies, or subjected to TUNEL assay. Inhibitors
were added 30 min before rK5 addition. B, primary human brain MvEC were
treated with siRNA for 68 h, replated, and treated with siRNA for an additional 4
h and then treated with rK5 or vehicle (17 h) followed by a TUNEL assay. TNF-a
induction of apoptosis was used as a positive control in the TUNEL assays.

surface calreticulin and thrombospondin-1 in coronary artery
endothelial cells (19, 20). Differential LRP1 signaling is thought to
be due to different adaptor molecules that bind to the
phosphorylated tyrosine residue(s) in the LRP1 cytoplasmic tail
and thereby activate different downstream effectors (21, 23, 43).
We found that p38 MAPK was activated with rK5 treatment postirradiation and that p38 MAPK was necessary for rK5-induced
apoptosis of the irradiated and unirradiated brain MvEC. In
contrast, neither ERK nor JNK were necessary for the rK5-induced
apoptosis of the human brain MvEC. Notably, the LRP1 family
member LRP8, expressed on platelets, is known to activate p38
MAPK upon binding its ligand, the low-density lipoprotein,
suggesting that the LRP family of proteins is capable of signaling
to p38 MAPK (44).
In support of the potential clinical relevance of our findings, we
show that the expression of GRP78 is increased on the MvEC in
glioblastoma tumor samples compared with the normal brain.
GRP78 expression was also increased on the tumor cells in the
glioblastoma biopsy samples compared with glial cells in the
normal brain. Our results are consistent with those in the literature,
indicating that GRP78 expression is up-regulated in tumors
(reviewed in refs. 15, 45, 46). Two conditions frequently found in
malignant tumors, hypoxia and hypoglycemia, are known to upregulate GRP78 expression (14, 47). Recently, GRP78 expression has

been associated with chemoresistance, making it a promising
target for cancer therapy (reviewed in refs. 15, 45, 48).
In summary, our data indicate that irradiation sensitizes primary
human brain MvEC to the apoptosis-inducing effect of rK5 and
that this proapoptotic signal requires LRP1 internalization of
GRP78 and p38 MAPK activity. As the cell surface binding partner
for rK5 (GRP78) and its scavenger receptor partner (LRP1; ref. 49)
are both expressed on MvEC in glioblastoma tumor biopsy
samples, these data suggest that rK5 treatment post-irradiation
should be considered in the design of new therapies for patients
with glioblastoma tumors.
