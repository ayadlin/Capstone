ABSTRACT:
Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) promotes tumor growth and
malignant progression and enhances chemoresistance of gastric cancer. Recently,
we noted an inverse correlation between RhoGDI2 and 14-3-3σ expression,
which suggests that 14-3-3σ is a target of gastric cancer metastasis and the
chemoresistance-promoting effect of RhoGDI2. Herein, we evaluated whether 14-33σ is regulated by RhoGDI2 and is functionally important for the RhoGDI2-induced
cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells. We used highly metastatic and cisplatinresistant RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells and observed decreased 14-3-3σ
mRNA and protein expression. Depletion of 14-3-3σ in SNU-484 control cells enhanced
cisplatin resistance, whereas restoration of 14-3-3σ in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU484 cells impaired cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. We also found that the
phosphorylation levels of Erk and p38 kinases significantly decreased in RhoGDI2overexpressing SNU-484 cells and recovered after 14-3-3σ expression, and that
decreased activities of these kinases were critical for RhoGDI2-induced cisplatin
resistance. In conclusion, 14-3-3σ is a RhoGDI2-regulated gene that appears to be
important for suppressing the chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

limited by the different efficacies of chemotherapeutic
regimens, diverse disease states of patients and response
rate to drugs, drug-related side-effects, acquisition of drug
resistance, and cancer recurrence with metastasis [8-11].
To this end, the targeted approaches that focus on drug
resistance-associated molecules are required to improve
the efficacy of chemotherapy against advanced gastric
cancers.
RhoGDI2 belongs to a family of Rho GTPase
dissociate inhibitors (RhoGDIs). They are pivotal
regulators of the function of Rho GTPase and typically
exert their effects by forming a complex with Rho
GTPase, and thereby modulating their nucleotide

Although the incidence and mortality of gastric
cancer have steadily declined in recent decades, it remains
the fourth most common type of cancer and the second
leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide [1]. Surgery
is an effective treatment for gastric cancer. Recent research
has also shown that chemotherapy following radical
surgery is an effective adjuvant therapy for East Asian
patients [2]. Cisplatin is one of the most widely used
drugs for chemotherapy and improves the overall survival
for cancer patients [3-7]. However, cancer treatment is

exchange and membrane association. Therefore, RhoGDIs
play significant roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton,
cell polarity, microtubule dynamics, membrane transport
pathways, and transcription factor activities [12, 13].
Unlike other members of the family (such as RhoGDI1
and RhoGDI3), RhoGDI2 is preferentially expressed
in hematopoietic cells, and appears to have a narrow
selectivity and lower binding affinity for Rho GTPases
[14]. RhoGDI2 associates with and negatively regulates
Rac1 and Rac3 in breast cancer cells, but not RhoA,
Cdc42, and RhoC [15]. In contrast, it positively regulates
Rac1 in human bladder cancer cells [16]. The significant
role of RhoGDI2 in cancer has been previously noted in
several lines of study. RhoGDI2 expression is inversely
correlated with invasive capacity in bladder cancer cell
lines [17]. Furthermore, reduced RhoGDI2 protein
expression has been associated with poor prognosis for
patients with advanced bladder cancer [18]. In contrast,
RhoGDI2 mRNA expression is significantly higher in
ovarian adenocarcinomas than in benign adenomas [19].
Consistent with this finding, RhoGDI2 is overexpressed
in human breast cancer cell lines, and it increases cancer
cell invasiveness and motility in vitro [20]. We also
demonstrated that RhoGDI2 expression is positively
correlated with tumor progression and metastatic
potential in gastric cancer [21]. In addition, our recent
work demonstrated that RhoGDI2 is associated with the
acquisition of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (such

A

as cisplatin), which is a hallmark of aggressive cancers, in
gastric cancer cells [22].
To delineate the mechanism by which RhoGDI2
promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and chemoresistance,
we performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) on proteins that were derived from a RhoGDI2overexpressing SNU-484 human gastric cancer cell
line and control cells, and noted that levels of 14-3-3σ,
which is a member of the multifunctional 14-3-3 protein
family, were significantly reduced [23]. In this study,
we demonstrated that the downregulation of 14-3-3σ is
largely correlated with the cisplatin-resistant phenotype
of RhoGDI2-overexpessing gastric cancer cells. Of note,
the restoration of 14-3-3σ is associated with impaired
RhoGDI2-induced chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells
through the activation of p38 and Erk.

RESULTS
RhoGDI2 downregulates 14-3-3σ expression
Previously, we identified 14 downregulated proteins
in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-4) gastric
cancer cells compared with control SNU-484(Mock) cells
by using comparative 2-DE [23]. For further analysis, we
selected 14-3-3σ that was previously implicated in cancer

cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. To validate
our mass spectrometry results, we performed reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot
analyses to determine the mRNA and protein expression
levels of 14-3-3σ in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484
cells and RhoGDI2-depleted MKN-28 cells. Consistent
with the results of 2-DE and imaging analysis (Fig.
1A), the mRNA and protein expression of 14-3-3σ were
significantly downregulated in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484 cells and upregulated in RhoGDI2-depleted
MKN-28 cells, compared to its expression in control
cells (Fig. 1B). We also examined the mRNA expression
levels of the other 14-3-3 isoforms (β, γ, ε, ζ, η, and τ) in
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells, but could not
find any significant differences between these cells and
the control cells (Fig. 1C). To further elucidate whether
the decreased expression of 14-3-3σ is associated with
RhoGDI2 expression, we observed 14-3-3σ expression
levels in HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells after transient
transfection with a Flag-tagged RhoGDI2 expression
vector. As shown in Fig. 1D, transient expression of
RhoGDI2 caused the markedly reduced expression of
14-3-3σ compared with the expression level in the vectortransfected control cells, which suggests that 14-3-3σ is a
direct target of RhoGDI2.

A

Since 14-3-3σ is known to enhance the
chemosensitivity of some types of cancer cells [24-27],
we first examined whether depletion of endogenous 14-33σ expression could enhance chemoresistance of gastric
cancer cells. For this purpose, we used SNU-484(Mock)
cells in which 14-3-3σ, which is highly expressed (Fig.
1B), was depleted by employing siRNA transfection. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the expression of 14-3-3σ was markedly
reduced in 14-3-3σ-specific siRNA transfected cells, but
not in control siRNA transfected cells. To determine
whether the depletion of 14-3-3σ expression affects
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we analyzed the cells by
TUNEL staining. Control cells were highly sensitive to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B and C), as previously
reported.22 However, depletion of 14-3-3σ significantly
attenuated cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B and C)
and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
(Fig. 2D) in SNU-484(Mock) cells. These results led
us to hypothesize that the downregulation of 14-3-3σ
contributes to the RhoGDI2-induced chemoresistance of
gastric cancer cells.

empty vector (pcDNA4-myc-His) was stably transfected
into RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells.
The expression levels of 14-3-3σ in the respective cells
were verified by performing western blot analysis using
anti-myc antibody (Fig. 3A). RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484(GDI2-7/Mock) control cells were highly
resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B and C),
as previously reported [22]. However, the overexpression
of 14-3-3σ significantly increased cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 3B and C) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3D)
in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells.

To determine whether 14-3-3σ expression can

14-3-3σ-overexpressing cells in RhoGDI2-overexpressing

These results suggest that the downregulation of 14-3-3σ
expression confers resistance to RhoGDI2-overexpressing
gastric cancer cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis.
To determine if 14-3-3σ expression affects the
chemosensitivity of RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells in vivo, 14-3-3σ-overexpressing SNU484(GDI2-7/14-3-3σ-2) cells and control cells (GDI27/Mock) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks
of nude mice. Growth of the 14-3-3σ-overexpressing
SNU-484(GDI2-7/14-3-3σ-2) cell-injected tumor did not
differ from that of control cells (Fig. 3E and F). Cisplatin
significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice that had been
injected with 14-3-3σ-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI27/14-3-3σ-2) cells, but not in mice that had been injected
with control cells (GDI2-7/Mock) (Fig. 3E and F). These
findings indicate that 14-3-3σ contributes to the inhibition
of resistance to cisplatin of RhoGDI2-expressing gastric
cancer cells in xenograft tumor models.

different cytotoxic agents and p38/JNK kinase activities
have been known to be increased in RhoGDI2-depleted
breast cancer cells [15], we first assessed whether
the activities of these apoptosis-related kinases are
suppressed in RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric cancer
cells. To this end, we examined MAPK activation in
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells by assessing
their phosphorylation states by using antibodies specific
to the phosphorylated species of each enzyme. As shown
in Fig 4A, the phosphorylation levels of Erk and p38,
but not JNK, were significantly decreased in RhoGDI2overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-4 and GDI2-7) cells
compared with control cells (Mock) under normal culture
condition. We next examined whether suppression of
Erk or p38 activity affects cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
gastric cancer cells. Suppression of Erk and p38 activity
by U0126 and SB203580, respectively, significantly
inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B and C) and
PARP cleavage (Fig. 4D) in SNU-484(Mock) cells. These
results suggest that suppression of Erk and p38 activity is
critical for the cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells.

in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells.
We next examined whether 14-3-3σ-mediated activation
of Erk and p38 activities is critical for the recovery of
cisplatin sensitivity in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU484(GDI2-7) cells. Suppression of Erk and p38 activities
by their specific inhibitors, respectively, markedly
inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B and C) and
PARP cleavage (Fig. 5D) in 14-3-3σ-overexpressing SNU484(GDI2-7) cells (14-3-3σ-1 and 14-3-3σ-2). All of these

Since 14-3-3σ regulates MAPK activity and the

of 14-3-3σ expression is critical for the repression of
Erk and p38 activities in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells. As we expected, the levels of

Immediately after removal of the culture-insert, cell
images were obtained at various time points (0-30 h) under
a light microscope. After 30 h, complete wound closure
(100%) was achieved in the RhoGDI2-overexpressing
SNU-484 control (Mock) cells, whereas only 14.9% (143-3σ-1) and 41% (14-3-3σ-2) wound closure was achieved
in 14-3-3σ-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells
compared with the control cells (Figure 6B and C). Taken
together, these results suggest that the downregulation
of 14-3-3σ expression plays a key role in RhoGDI2induced gastric cancer cell migration and invasion.
In an effort to exclude the possibility that the effect of
14-3-3σ on the migration and invasion of RhoGDI2overexpressing gastric cancer cells was attributable to
different proliferation rates, we compared the growth
rates of 14-3-3σ-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7)
cells (14-3-3σ-1 and 14-3-3σ-2) with those of control

14-3-3σ suppresses RhoGDI2-induced migration

invasion21 as well as enhances cisplatin resistance, we

alter the migration and invasive properties in RhoGDI2overexpressing gastric cancer cells. Ectopic expression
of 14-3-3σ considerably decreased the invasiveness of
RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484(GDI2-7) cells (143-3σ-1 and 14-3-3σ-2) compared with control (Mock)

participates in the regulation of subcellular localization,
protein stability, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and the cell
cycle [37-39]. However, 14-3-3σ is directly associated
with human cancers, and the downregulation of 14-3-3σ
expression has been observed in various human cancers,
including those of the lung, prostate, breast, and liver
[40, 41]. Consistent with our findings, several previous
findings have shown that 14-3-3σ expression is elevated in
response to different cellular stresses, and that it enhances
the chemosensitivity of human colorectal, breast, and
nasopharyngeal cancer [24-27].
We also suggested that the ectopic expression of
14-3-3σ could activate Erk and p38 MAPK, and that
suppression of 14-3-3σ-mediated Erk and p38 activation
is critical for the cisplatin resistance of RhoGDI2overexpressing gastric cancer cells. We showed that
the phosphorylation levels of Erk and p38 kinase are
markedly downregulated in RhoGDI2-overexpressing
(14-3-3σ downregulated) gastric cancer cells. However,
the restoration of 14-3-3σ expression reverses this
phenomenon. It is believed that MAPK activation is a
major component that decides the fate of a cell in response
to cisplatin. The pro-death or pro-survival roles of MAPKs
in response to cisplatin could depend on the type of
activated MAPK. While the activation of p38 plays only a
pro-death role, the induction of Erk can take on both roles
(survival or cell death) as a consequence [42]. Consistent
with our results, the knockdown of RhoGDI2 expression
significantly increases the phosphorylation levels of
p38 kinase, and pretreatment with p38 kinase inhibitor
significantly inhibits the apoptosis of RhoGDI2-depleted
breast cancer cells [15]. Benzinger et al. also showed that
the ectopic expression of 14-3-3σ enhances Erk1/2 activity
in colon cancer cells [43]. The increase in MAPK activity
that was observed after 14-3-3σ expression may be due to
interactions with multiple ligands. Among others, A-RAF,
B-RAF, and c-RAF seem to be good candidates because
previous studies on the interaction between RAF proteins
and 14-3-3 isoforms have shown that 14-3-3 proteins are
critical modulators of RAF activity [44].
We also examined the possible pathways that lead
to RhoGDI2-induced 14-3-3σ downregulation. Recently,
we demonstrated that phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ)
is activated in RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484 cells,
and that it is required for RhoGDI2-mediated cisplatin
resistance and cancer cell invasion in gastric cancer [45].
To determine whether PLC is required for RhoGDI2induced 14-3-3σ downregulation, we examined the
expression levels of 14-3-3σ in PLCγ-depleted SNU484(GDI2) and control cells, but did not observe any
difference (data not shown). Alternatively, ongoing studies
in our laboratory have revealed that Rac1, but not RhoA
or Cdc42, is activated in RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells. Therefore, we are now examining whether
the activation of Rac1 is involved in RhoGDI2-induced
14-3-3σ downregulation.

DISCUSSION
Several studies over the last decade have linked
RhoGDI1 expression to apoptosis and chemoresistance of
various human cancer cells. For example, the reduction
of RhoGDI1 expression is associated with astrocytoma
cell protection and tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer
cells [28, 29]. In addition, Ronneburg et al. demonstrated
that RhoGDI1 may sensitize invasive breast cancer to
treatment with CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and 5-fluorouracil), and higher RhoGDI1 expression
tends to be correlated with a better clinical outcome
[30]. However, RhoGDI1 was also described as an
antiapoptotic protein in breast, lymphoma, fibrosarcoma,
and lung cancer cells [31-33]. In contrast to RhoGDI1,
several groups have focused their research on elucidating
the explicit mechanisms by which RhoGDI2 regulates
aggressive features of cancer cells, particularly motility,
invasiveness, and metastasis. However, we recently
suggested that RhoGDI2 enhances the chemoresistance
of gastric cancer through the upregulation of Bcl2 expression as well as promotes tumor growth and
malignant progression.22 Consistent with our results,
Zheng et al. suggested that the knockdown of RhoGDI2
expression significantly increases the sensi­tivity of colon
cancer cells to 5-FU [34], and that the ectopic expression
of RhoGDI2 in gastric cancer cells induces resistance to
5-FU and reverses 5-FU-induced G2/M phase arrest [35].
RhoGDI1 protects breast cancer cells from druginduced apoptosis through the inhibition of Rac1 cleavage
that is mediated by capase-3 [31]. Although RhoGDI1
is completely resistant to degradation during apoptosis,
RhoGDI2 is well characterized as being a substrate for
caspases and is cleaved in various cells during apoptosis
[36]. Therefore, RhoGDI2 may act as an antiapoptotic
molecule via a mechanism that is distinct from RhoGDI1
and may do so prior to caspase activation during druginduced apoptosis. To delineate the mechanism by which
RhoGDI2 contributes to chemoresistance and tumor
metastasis, we performed 2-DE on proteins that were
derived from a RhoGDI2-overexpressing SNU-484
human gastric cancer cell line and control cells. We found
that the expression levels of 14-3-3σ were significantly
downregulated in the RhoGDI2-overexpressing gastric
cancer cells [23]. The results of this study indicate
that 14-3-3σ is a direct target of RhoGDI2 and that the
downregulation of 14-3-3σ is important for enhancing
the chemoresistance of RhoGDI2-expressing gastric
cancer cells. 14-3-3σ was first identified as being a human
mammary epithelium-specific marker 1 (HME1) and

the manufacturer’s instruction. Cisplatin-treated or nontreated cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized
and stained using the TUNEL reaction mixture in the dark.
The cells were then stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI solution
for 5 min at room temperature in the dark and observed
under a fluorescence microscope. The apoptosis rate was
quantified by the TUNEL-positive rate.

fresh media and photographs of the migration assay were
taken at 0, 5, 15, 20, 25 and 30 h using a phase-contrast
microscope with digital camera. The cell migration was
quantified by calculating the cell-covered area using
WimScratch software (Wimasis, Munich, Germany).

Tumorigenicity in nude mice

The cells were placed in a 6-well plate at a
concentration of 3 × 104 cells per well. After incubation for
1 to 4 days, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 3 ml
of appropriate medium. Cell suspensions were centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1
ml of appropriate medium. The viable cells were counted
with a hemocytometer after trypan blue staining.

Proliferation assay

For tumorigenicity experiments, six-weekold female BALB/cSlc-nude mice were injected
subcutaneously with 5.5×106 SNU-484(GDI2-7/143-3σ-2) or SNU-484(GDI2-7/Mock) cells. When
tumors measured an average volume of 50 mm3, the
mice (12 per group) were treated with cisplatin (5mg/
kg, 2 times a week) or physiological saline for three
weeks. Tumors were measured with calipers to estimate
volume(0.5×width2×length). All animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees (IACUC) of Gyeongsang National University
and followed National Research Council Guidelines.

Statistical analysis
We performed statistical analysis using the unipolar,
paired Student t-test. The significance of the data was
accepted when the P value was less than 0.05.

FUNDING

Invasion and migration assay

This work was supported by grant from Basic
Science Research Program through the National Research
Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of
Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2011-0010805),
and National R&D Program for Cancer Control, Ministry
of Health, Welfare and Family affairs, Republic of Korea
(0820050).

The invasion ability of cancer cells was assessed
using a matrigel-based transwell system. Briefly, 24well cell culture plate inserts with 8-μm pore size
polycarbonate membrane (Corning, NY, USA) were
precoated with 100 μl matrigel/DMEM solution (2.2 mg/
ml, BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) and incubated at 37oc
for 2 h or overnight at 4oc. All the cells were preincubated
in serum-free media with or without inhibitors for 24 h.
2.5 × 105 cells in 250 µl of medium (no serum) were
placed in the insert and allowed to invade for 48 h. The
lower chamber was filled with 750 µl of appropriated
media containing 20% FBS. After incubation, medium
remaining on top of the insert were removed by pipetting
and non-invading cells on the upper surface of the insert
membrane were removed with cotton swab. After washing
twice with PBS, the insert membranes were fixed for
10 min with MeOH/Acetic acid (3:1) at -20oc and stained
with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (SIGMA) for 20 min at
37oc. The upper surface of the insert membrane was gently
scrubbed with cotton swab again and washed with distilled
water. Membranes were cut and mount on slide glass and
the number of invaded cells was counted microscopically
at 100-200 × magnification. For wound healing assays,
4.9 × 104 cells in 70 µl of medium were seeded into
Culture-Insert (Ibidi, Munich, Germany). After the cells
were confluent, to inhibit the effect of cell proliferation,
the cells were pretreated with 10 µg/ml mitomycin C
(SIGMA) for 2 h, and washed with culture medium. After
removal of Culture-Insert, cells were incubated with
