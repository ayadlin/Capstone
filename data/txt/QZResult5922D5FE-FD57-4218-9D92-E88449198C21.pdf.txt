Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B) is a multifunctional
serine/threonine kinase. We showed that the expression of
GSK3B was drastically down-regulated in human cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas. Due
to its negative regulation of many oncogenic proteins, we
hypothesized that GSK3B may function as a tumor suppressor
during the neoplastic transformation of epidermal cells. We
tested this hypothesis using an in vitro model system, JB6
mouse epidermal cells. In response to epidermal growth factor
(EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the
promotion-sensitive JB6 P+ cells initiate neoplastic transformation, whereas the promotion-resistant JB6 P cells do not.
JB6 P cells expressed much higher levels of GSK3B than JB6
P+ cells; JB7 cells, the transformed derivatives of JB6, had the
least amount of GSK3B. The activity of GSK3B is negatively
regulated by its phosphorylation at Ser9. EGF and TPA induced
strong Ser9 phoshorylation in JB6 P+ cells, but phosphorylation was seen at a much lesser extent in JB6 P cells. EGF
and TPA-stimulated Ser9 phosphorylation was mediated by
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and protein kinase C
(PKC) pathways. Inhibition of GSK3B activation significantly
stimulated activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. Overexpression
of wild-type (WT) and S9A mutant GSK3B in JB6 P+ cells
suppressed EGF and TPA-mediated anchorage-independent
growth in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Overexpression of a kinase-deficient (K85R) GSK3B, in contrast,
potentiated anchorage-independent growth and drastically
enhanced in vivo tumorigenicity. Together, these results
indicate that GSK3B plays an important role in skin
tumorigenesis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7756–64]

Introduction
Glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK3h) is a serine/threonine
kinase that was first identified as a critical mediator in glycogen
metabolism and insulin signaling. It is now known that GSK3h is
a multifunctional kinase; more than 40 proteins are substrates of
GSK3h, including transcription factors, cell cycle/survival regulators and oncogenic/proto-oncogenic proteins (1, 2). Unlike most
protein kinases, GSK3h is constitutively active in resting cells
and undergoes a rapid and transient inhibition in response to a

number of external signals (3). GSK3h activity is regulated by sitespecific phosphorylation. Full activity of GSK3h generally requires
phosphorylation on Tyr216, and conversely, phosphorylation at
Ser9 inhibits GSK3h activity. GSK3h is a negative regulator of Wnt/
h-catenin signaling (1, 4). Because some oncogenic transcription
factors [e.g., activator protein-1 (AP-1)] and proto-oncoproteins
(i.e., h-catenin) are putative GSK3h substrates for phosphorylationdependent inactivation (4), it has been hypothesized that GSK3h
may interfere with cellular neoplastic transformation and tumor
development. However, there are only limited studies examining
the involvement of GSK3h in tumor development; the findings
are sometimes contradictory (5–8). The role of GSK3h during
tumorigenesis remains unclear. Carcinogenesis is a complex
process that can be divided experimentally into three stages,
namely, initiation, promotion, and progression. Initiation is
associated with irreversible, carcinogen-mediated DNA mutation.
In contrast, promotion is a reversible process in which there are
increases in the rate of cell replication and/or alterations in gene
expression. Progression represents the final genetic changes
associated with the conversion of benign tumors into fully
malignant cells. Skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide
(9). Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
development and progression of skin tumors is still fragmentary.
JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cells (Cl 41), originally derived from
primary mouse epidermal cells, offer an excellent model to
investigate the molecular events that are associated with tumor
promotion. These cells undergo a response analogous to secondstage tumor promotion in mouse skin when treated with various
tumor promoters. For example, exposure of JB6 P+ cells to
epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate (TPA) induces the phenotype of anchorage-independent
growth and tumorigenicity in vivo (10–12). In contrast, JB6 P cells
are promotion resistant; EGF and TPA fail to initiate neoplastic
transformation in these cells (10, 13). JB6 cells and their derivatives
have been extensively used as an in vitro model for the promotion
of neoplastic transformation (10, 12–15). It has been shown that
three signaling pathways are involved in the transformation of JB6
P+ cells, namely, phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, PKC and
mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) kinase 1 (MEK1)/Erk (13–16). Activation of these
signaling pathways by EGF or TPA results in AP-1 transactivation,
which is essential for the transformation of JB6 P+ cells (13, 14, 16).
In this study, we compared the expression of GSK3h in human
nonmelanoma skin cancers (cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas
and basal cell carcinomas) to normal skin tissues. Using the JB6
cell system, we have investigated the role of GSK3h in neoplastic
transformation and delineated the signal pathways that regulate
GSK3h activity.

GSK3b Regulates the Transformation of Epidermal Cells

Materials and Methods
Materials and cell cultures. All antibodies except antiactin antibody
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.. Antiactin antibody was
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PKC inhibitors (GF10203X or
bisindolylmaleimide I and Go6976), PKA inhibitor (H89), GSK3h inhibitor
(TDZD-8), and MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) were purchased from Calbiochem. PI3K inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin), GSK3h inhibitor
(SB216763), LiCl, and lactacystin were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co.. c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) inhibitor (D-JNKI) was purchased from Alexis
Biochemicals.
JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line (Cl 41), JB6 P and transformed JB7
cells were grown in EMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 25 Ag/mL gentamicin at 37jC with 5% CO2. JB7
cells were derived from soft agar colonies of JB6 P+ treated with TPA for
3 weeks. These cells form colonies in soft agar and display tumorigenicity
in vivo. The stable transfectants of JB6 P+ cells expressing AP-1-luciferase
reporter (Cl 41 AP-1) have been previously described (17, 18).
Human skin samples and immunohistochemical study of GSK3B.
Human skin tissues were obtained from surgical specimens at the
Department of Dermatology, Xijing Hospital (Xi’an, China). The protocol
for collecting human tissues was approved by the Ethical Committee of
Xijing Hospital. The specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded.
The samples comprised of 31 primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas
and 12 basal cell carcinomas. The median patient age was 61 years. Tumor
diagnoses were established through pathologic evaluation of paraffinembedded tissues stained with H&E. None of the patients received radiation
or chemotherapy before the operation. Eight samples of histologically
normal adult skin tissues were collected as controls.
Immunohistochemistry for GSK3h was done by the avidin-biotin indirect
immunoperoxidase method. Briefly, 4-Am-thick sections were dewaxed,
rehydrated, and incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to
block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were microwave treated in
0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH, 6.0) at 700 W for 10 min and rinsed with
0.01 mol/L TBS. Sections were incubated with normal horse serum for
20 min and then with primary antibodies (dilution 1:100) overnight at 4jC.
After rinsing in TBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary
antibodies at room temperature for 30 min, followed by an avidin-biotinperoxidase complex (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min. The reaction was
visualized with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (0.5 mg/mL,
Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Sections
were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin.
Establishing stable transfectants. Stable transfectants expressing
various GSK3h constructs were established as previously described (19).
V5-tagged GSK3h constructs (wild-type, S9A, and K85R) carried by vector
pcDNA3 were generous gifts from Dr. Thilo Hagen (University Hospital
Nottingham). Cell transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable
cell clones expressing exogenous GSK3h were screened by the treatment of
G418 (600 Ag/mL) for 3 to 4 weeks. Positive clones were verified by the
expression of V5 as well as the evidence of GSK3h overexpression. The
clones expressing the highest levels of exogenous GSK3h were selected for
subsequent experiments.
Immunoblotting. The immunoblotting procedure to detect phosphorylation and expression of signal proteins was done as previously described
(17). To control for the loading, the blots were stripped and reprobed with
an antiactin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some cases, the
density of immunoblotting was quantified with the software of Quantity
One (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Anchorage-independent growth. Anchorage-independent growth of
JB6 P+, JB7 cells, and stable transfectants expressing various GSK3h
constructs was determined by a previously described method (17). The cell
growth matrix consists of two layers of basal medium Eagle (BME) agar in
six-well culture trays. The base layer (2 mL) contained 10% FBS and 0.5%
BME agar. The top layer (0.5 mL) contained 10% FBS, 0.33% BME agar, and
the suspension of cells (0.5  104). EGF (10 ng/mL) or TPA (10 ng/mL)
were applied in both top and bottom layers. The cultures were maintained

at 37jC with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 10 to 14 days, and the number
of induced cell colonies was counted under a microscope. Colonies
containing eight or more cells were counted in four 0.5-cm2 areas
randomly chosen with respect to distance from the center of the well, and
the count was multiplied by the appropriate factor to give the colony
number per well.
Tumorigenicity in nude mice. To evaluate in vivo tumorigenicity,
5-week-old male nude mice (BALB/c nu/nu, f25 g; Charles River
Laboratories) were used. JB6 P+ cells and stable transfectants expressing
various GSK3h constructs were treated with EGF or TPA (0 or 10 ng/mL) for
6 days and then dissociated from monolayer cultures by trypsinization.
Cells were counted and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and resuspended
in PBS. An aliquot of cells (5  106 in 100 AL of PBS) that were treated with
EGF or TPA (0 or 10 ng/mL) was directly injected to both flanks of the
animals. One injection per flank was done for each mouse. Eight animals
were used for each treatment group. Mice were maintained in a pathogenfree environment; food and water were given ad libitum. Seven weeks after
the initial injections, the length (L) and width (W) of the s.c. tumor mass
were measured by calipers, and the tumor volume (TV) was calculated as
described by Yaguchi et al. (20): TV = 0.5  L  W 2. At the end of the
experiments, mice were sacrificed using a CO2 chamber. Animal housing
and all procedures followed the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the West Virginia University
Animal Care and Use Committee. Every effort was made to reduce the
number of animals and their suffering.
Measurement of AP-1 activity. AP-1 transactivation in JB6 P+
epidermal cells was determined by assaying the activity of the luciferase
reporter (17, 18). The assay accurately measures AP-1 transactivation
(13, 18). Briefly, JB6 P+ cells expressing AP-1-luciferase reporter (Cl 41 AP-1)
were cultured in 96-well plates and grown in a medium containing 10% FBS.
The plates were incubated at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2. Subconfluent cultures were maintained in a medium containing
0.1% FBS for 24 h and treated with or without various protein kinase
inhibitors 30 min before exposure to EGF or TPA. After treatment, cellular
protein was extracted with a 1 lysis buffer supplied in the luciferase assay
kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with a monolight
luminometer (3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). AP-1 activity
(luciferase activity) was calculated and expressed relative to the untreated
cultures.
Statistical analysis. Differences among treatment groups were tested
using an ANOVA. Differences in which P was < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. In cases where significant differences were detected,
specific post hoc comparisons between treatment groups were examined
with Student-Newman-Keuls tests.

Results
Expression of GSK3B in human skin tissues. We first
examined the expression of GSK3h and its phsophorylated forms
[pGSK3h (Ser9 and Tyr216)] in histologically normal skin specimens.
In all eight normal samples examined, a strong expression of
GSK3h and pGSK3h (Ser9) was observed in the keratinocytes
(Fig. 1A); the immunostaining of pGSK3h (Tyr216) was either very
weak or negative. GSK3h and pGSK3h (Ser9) were also expressed
in keratinocytes of patients with cutaneous squamous cell
carcinomas or basal cell carcinomas; however, the immunostaining
of GSK3h and pGSK3h (Ser9) in patients with skin carcinomas
was generally weaker than that of age- and sex-matched normal
subjects (Fig. 1B). In all tumor specimens (31 cases of primary
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and 12 cases of basal cell
carcinomas), cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell
carcinomas expressed much less GSK3h and pGSK3h (Ser9) than
adjacent nontumor-bearing keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). The expression
of pGSK3h (Tyr216) in the skin specimens of cancer patients was
consistently negative (data not shown).

Expression of GSK3B in JB7, JB6 P+ and P cells. JB6 cells
and their derivatives offer an excellent system to study the role of
GSK3h in the transformation of epidermal cells. Because GSK3h
was apparently down-regulated in skin carcinomas, we sought to
compare the expression of GSK3h among tumor promotionresistant JB6 P cells, promotion-sensitive JB6 P+ cells, and
transformed JB7 cells. Among these cells, JB7 had the least amount
of GSK3h, whereas JB6 P cells expressed the highest levels of
GSK3h; the levels of GSK3h in JB6 P+ were intermediate (Fig. 2A).
Cyclin D1 is a substrate of GSK3h; GSK3h may regulate the
expression of cyclin D1 by transcriptional activation or controlling
its degradation (21). The expression of cyclin D1 in these cells was
inversely correlated to the levels of GSK3h (Fig. 2A). Two potent
tumor promoters for JB6 cells, EGF and TPA, induced pGSK3h
(Ser9; Fig. 2B). EGF produced a rapid (5 min) induction of pGSK3h
(Ser9). TPA-mediated pGSK3h (Ser9) was slower but more
sustained. EGF and TPA had little effect on pGSK3h (Tyr216; data
not shown). Although JB6 P cells expressed high levels of GSK3h
(Fig. 2A), they were less sensitive to the induction of EGF and TPA
of pGSK3h (Ser9; Fig. 2B), indicating that they were more resistant
to negative regulation.

determine whether GSK3h is involved in the transformation of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

JB6 P+ cells, we have established JB6 cells stably expressing wildtype (WT), S9A, or K85R GSK3h. S9A mutant is unable to be
phosphorylated at Ser9 and, therefore, resistant to inhibitory
regulation; K85R mutant is kinase deficient and functions as a
dominant negative protein (6, 22). Overexpression of these
exogenous GSK3h proteins was verified by immunoblotting using
either anti-GSK3h or V5 antibody (Fig. 2C). The levels of cyclin
D1 were correlated with the status of GSK3h expression. JB6
P+ cells overexpressing S9A expressed the least amount of cyclin
D1, whereas cells overexpressing K85R had the highest expression
(Fig. 2C). Cells overexpressing S9A were less sensitive to EGFinduced pGSK3h (Ser9) and up-regulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2D),
indicating that these cells were more resistant to the negative
regulation of GSK3h. In contrast, cells overexpressing K85R were
more sensitive to EGF-induced up-regulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2D),
verifying a dominant negative role of K85R mutant. GSK3h may
regulate the expression of cyclin D1 by transcriptional activation
or controlling its degradation (21). Lactacystin, a proteasome
inhibitor, failed to reverse S9A-induced down-regulation of
cyclin D1, whereas it enhanced K85R-mediated up-regulation
of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2E). The results suggested that GSK3h regulated
cyclin D1 expression in JB6 cells primarily through transcriptional
control.

GSK3b Regulates the Transformation of Epidermal Cells

The effect of GSK3h on the transformation of JB6 P+ cells was
first determined by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar.
As shown in Fig. 3A, EGF and TPA stimulated the formation of
cell colonies in soft agar. EGF- and TPA-induced cell colonies
were significantly suppressed by the overexpression of WT and
S9A GSK3h. In contrast, EGF- and TPA-induced anchorageindependent growth was drastically enhanced by the overexpression of K85R mutant. It was noted that JB6 P+ cells
expressing K85R formed some small cell colonies (contained less
than eight cells) in the absence of EGF and TPA. These small cell
colonies were not scored. The results suggested that GSK3h was a
negative regulator of cell transformation. JB7 cells formed
colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3B). Two inhibitors of GSK3h (LiCl
and SB216763) significantly enhanced anchorage-independent
growth of JB7 cells. In contrast, overexpression of GSK3h in JB7
cells suppressed anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 3B). To
further assess the role of GSK3h in tumorigenicity, we injected
EGF- or TPA-exposed JB6 P+ cells expressing WT, S9A, or K85R
GSK3h to nude mice and evaluated the formation of s.c. tumors.
Cells were injected to both flanks for each mouse, and each flank

received one injection. There were eight animals for each
injection group. The number and the size of s.c. tumors were
measured 7 weeks following initial injection. EGF- or TPAexposed JB6 P+ cells expressing control vectors formed s.c.
tumors in nude mice (Fig. 3C). For example, eight animals
received injections of EGF-exposed JB6 P+ cells (each animals
received two injections; one in each flank), a total of 11 tumors
formed, and the average volume of each tumor was 1157 F 105
mm3 (Table 1). However, in the eight animals injected with EGFexposed cells expressing WT or S9A GSK3h, only three and two
tumors formed, respectively. In addition, the average volume of
tumors was significantly smaller. The tumor volumes in animals
injected with cells expressing WT or S9A GSK3h were 632 F 79
and 478 F 81 mm3, respectively. In contrast, EGF-exposed cells
overexpressing K85R showed enhanced tumorigenicity in nude
mice; a total of 14 tumors formed, and the average volume of
each tumor was 3756 F 279 mm3 (Table 1). Similar results were
obtained with the treatment of TPA (Table 1). It was noted that
three small tumors (368 F 65 mm3) formed in the nude mice that
received an injection of cells expressing K85R that was not

P+ and P cells cultured in serum-free media were treated with EGF (10 ng/mL) and TPA (10 ng/mL) for a specified period. The expression of phosphorylated

in Materials and Methods. The expression of V5, GSK3h, and cyclin D1 in these cells was examined with immunoblotting. D, JB6 cells expressing various GSK3h
mutants were treated with EGF (10 ng/mL) for a specified period. The expression of phosphorylated GSK3h (Ser9) and cyclin D1 was examined with immunoblotting.
E, JB6 cells expressing various GSK3h mutants were treated with lactacystin (Lac , 0 or 10 Amol/L) for 1 h. The expression of cyclin D1 was examined with
immunoblotting.

For each experimental group, there were eight animals. Seven weeks following inoculation, the number of s.c. tumor masses in each animal was scored, and the volume
of tumors was measured by calipers as described in Materials and Methods. A representative photo shows s.c. tumors induced by EGF treatment in nude mice. 1, JB6;

exposed to EGF or TPA. Thus, the results obtained from the nude
mice agreed with anchorage-independent growth.
PKC and PI3K/Akt mediate EGF- and TPA-induced inactivation of GSK3B. Previous studies show that EGF and TPA
activated PI3K/Akt, PKC, and MEK1/Erk pathways in JB6 P+ cells
(13, 14, 23). These pathways are potential upstream components of
GSK3h. We sought to determine whether EGF- and TPA-induced
inactivation of GSK3h was mediated by these signaling pathways.

Both EGF and TPA induced phosphorylation of Akt and PKC
(Fig. 4A). The profiles of EGF- and TPA-mediated phosphorylation,
however, were different. EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation was
rapid (5 min) and strong, whereas TPA-mediated Akt phosphorylation was modest and more persistent. As detected by an
antibody recognizing phosphorylated panPKC, EGF-induced phosphorylation of panPKC was weaker than that induced by TPA.
The profiles of EGF- and TPA-induced pGSK3h (Ser9) were also

different. EGF induced a rapid and strong phosphorylation of
GSK3h (Ser9), the maximal phosphorylation occurred between
5 and 15 min after EGF treatment. TPA-mediated phosphorylation
of GSK3h (Ser9) was gradual; it became evident at 15 min, and
maximal phosphorylation occurred at 3 to 6 h. Inhibitors of PI3K
blocked EGF-stimulated pGSK3h (Ser9) in JB6 P+ cells; an inhibitor
of PKC also decreased EGF-stimulated pGSK3h (Ser9), but to a
lesser extent (Fig. 4B and C), suggesting that the PI3K/Akt pathway
played a major role in EGF regulation of pGSK3h (Ser9). On the
other hand, inhibitor of PKC was more effective than the PI3K

inhibitor in down-regulating TPA-induced pGSK3h (Ser9). The
inhibitors for MEK1, JNK, and PKA had little effect on EGF- and
TPA-induced pGSK3h (Ser9; Fig. 4B and C). These results indicated
that PI3K/Akt and PKC mediated EGF- and TPA-induced pGSK3h
(Ser9), although the profiles of regulation were different.
Like PKC and PI3K/Akt, ERKs are critical regulators of the
transformation of JB6 cells (13). MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) did not

suggesting that ERK was not involved in GSK3h inactivation in

Figure 5. Role of GSK3h in AP-1 transactivation. A, JB6 P+ epidermal cells stably expressing AP-1 luciferase reporter were pretreated with two GSK3h inhibitors,
LiCl (20 mmol/L) and TDZD8 (10 Amol/L) or PI3K inhibitor (LY , 10 Amol/L) and PKC inhibitor (Bis , 1 Amol/L) for 30 min and then exposed to EGF (10 ng/mL) or
TPA (10 ng/mL) for 12 h. The activity of AP-1 was measured by a luciferase assay as described in Materials and Methods. The activity of AP-1 was expressed relative to
untreated cultures. The experiment was replicated thrice. *, P < 0.05, statistically significant difference from untreated JB6 P+ cells. #, P < 0.05, statistically significant

S9A-mutated GSK3h constructs or an siRNA for GSK3h for 48 h. The activity of AP-1 was measured as described above. The experiment was replicated thrice.
*, P < 0.05, statistically significant difference from cells transfected with an empty vector.

therefore sought to determine whether GSK3h affected ERK
activation in JB6 P+ cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, EGF elicited similar
phosphorylation of ERK in cells expressing WT, S9A, and K85R
GSK3h; furthermore, two inhibitors of GSK3h (LiCl and TDZD8)
failed to affect ERK phosphorylation (data not shown), indicating
that GSK3h was not involved in ERK activation.
GSK3B is involved in the regulation of AP-1. It has been
shown that AP-1 activity is essential for the transformation of JB6
P+ cells (12, 13, 23). We sought to determine whether GSK3h
regulates the activation of AP-1. As shown in Fig. 5A, two inhibitors
of GSK3h (LiCl and TDZD8) stimulated the basal as well as EGFand TPA-induced activation of AP-1. In contrast, inhibitors for PI3K
and PKC decreased EGF- and TPA-induced activation of AP-1.
Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of wild-type and S9A
GSK3h significantly inhibited AP-1 activity; in contrast, downregulation of GSK3h by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced
AP-1 activity (Fig. 5B). Together, these results indicated that GSK3h
was a negative regulator of AP-1.

Discussion
GSK3h is implicated in many biological processes, including
embryonic development, cell differentiation, and cell survival/cell
cycle control (4, 25). Because many oncogenic transcription factors
(e.g., c-Jun, c-Myc) and proto-oncoproteins (i.e., h-catenin) are
substrates of GSK3h for phosphorylation-dependent inactivation
(4), GSK3h may play a role in oncogenesis. However, information
regarding the involvement of GSK3h in tumorigenesis is limited,
and the function of GSK3h during cell transformation and cancer
progression remains unclear.
Here, we show a decreased expression of GSK3h and pGSK3h
(Ser9) in human nonmelanoma skin cancers (cutaneous squamous
cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas) compared with adjacent
normal keratinocytes. In addition, the immunostaining for GSK3h
and pGSK3h (Ser9) in keratinocytes of patients with cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas or basal cell carcinomas is generally
weaker than keratinocytes of age- and sex-matched normal

subjects. The decreased immunostaining for pGSK3h (Ser9) likely
results from the down-regulation of total GSK3h expression. Mouse
epidermal (JB6) cells have been extensively used as an in vitro
model for studying the promotion of neoplastic transformation
(10, 12–15). Consistent with the observations in human skin
tissues, the expression levels of GSK3h in JB6 cells are correlated to
the stage or potential of cell transformation. JB7 cells, the
transformed derivatives of JB6, have the least amount of GSK3h,
whereas promotion-resistant JB6 P cells express the highest levels
of GSK3h; the levels of GSK3h in promotion-sensitive JB6 P+ cells
are intermediate. In addition, tumor promoters EGF and TPA
induce strong phosphorylation of GSK3h at Ser9 in JB6 P+ cells,
indicating an inactivation of GSK3h. On the other hand, JB6
P cells are much less responsive to the negative regulation of
GSK3h. The involvement of GSK3h in skin tumorigenesis is further
shown by the modulation of GSK3h activity in JB6 P+ cells.
Overexpression of WT and S9A mutant GSK3h inhibits EGF- and
TPA-mediated anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, as well
as in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice. In contrast, overexpression
of a kinase-deficient K85R GSK3h drastically potentiates EGF- and
TPA-mediated anchorage-independent growth and greatly enhances in vivo tumorigenicity in response to EGF. Overexpression of a
kinase-deficient K85R GSK3h also has a modest promoting effect
on anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and in vivo
tumorigenicity of JB6 P+ cells in the absence of EGF. These results
verify that GSK3h negatively regulates epidermal cell transformation, and modulating GSK3h activity is sufficient to affect cell
transformation.
We further show that GSK3h is a negative regulator of AP-1
transactivation in JB6 P+ cells; the inhibitors of GSK3h increase
basal as well as EGF- and TPA-mediated AP-1 transactivation. This
result is consistent with previous findings using other cells, which
show that GSK3h activation results in the inhibition of AP-1
activity (26, 27). AP-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor
complex composed of a Jun family member and a FOS family
member that binds the TRE DNA sequence (5¶-TGAGTCA-3¶). It
is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including growth,

GSK3b Regulates the Transformation of Epidermal Cells

activate PI3K/Akt and PKC, which induce phosphorylation of GSK3h (Ser9) and
inactivate GSK3h. Inactivation of GSK3h stimulates oncogenic transcription
factors, such as AP-1. EGF and TPA can also activate AP-1 through the
MEK1/Erk pathway. Hyperactivity of AP-1 promotes skin tumorigenesis.

apoptosis, and differentiation (28). The mouse epidermal multistage carcinogenesis model provides a well-defined system for
examining the transformation of squamous epithelial cells to
benign squamous papillomas and their subsequent progression
into squamous cell carcinomas (29). With this carcinogenesis
model system, a number of studies show that AP-1 activity is
required for skin tumorigenesis as well as malignant transformation (30–33). These findings are confirmed by in vitro studies that
show that AP-1 activity is essential for the transformation of JB6
P+ cells (12, 13, 23). Three signaling pathways, namely, PI3K/Akt,
PKC, and MEK1/Erk, have been shown to regulate EGF- and TPAinduced AP-1 transactivation and transformation of JB6 P+ cells
(13, 14, 23). We show here that PI3K/Akt and PKC are upstream of
GSK3h, and both EGF- and TPA-stimulated pGSK3h (Ser9) is
mediated by PI3K/Akt and PKC. Thus, suppressing GSK3h activity
is one of the mechanisms for EGF- and TPA-induced AP-1
transactivation (Fig. 6). The interaction between Erk and GSK3h
has been previously reported (24, 34); however, we fail to find such
interaction in JB6 cells. Based on these findings, we propose a
signal cascade in which GSK3h plays an important role in
regulating AP-1 activity and cell transformation (Fig. 6): EGF and
TPA activate PI3K/Akt, PKC, and MEK1/Erk pathways. Activation
of PI3K/Akt and PKC results in the inhibition of GSK3h, which is
a negative regulator of AP-1. In the meantime, EGF- and TPAmediated ERK activation can also cause AP-1 transactivation.
Hyperactivity of AP-1 initiates the transformation process. In

addition to negatively regulating AP-1 activity, GSK3h is a wellknown inhibitor for Wnt/h-catenin signaling (1). Hyperactivity
of the Wnt/h-catenin signaling pathway is associated with the
development of a number of tumors as well as malignancies
(35–39). In terms of skin tumors, Wnt signaling is mainly
implicated in the development and progression of melanomas
(40). From the present study, however, it is not clear whether Wnt/
h-catenin signaling is also involved in GSK3h-induced suppression
of skin tumorigenesis.
Other studies also support a role of GSK3h as a ‘‘tumor
suppressor.’’ For example, expression of a kinase-inactive GSK3h in
adult mouse mammary glands promotes mammary tumorigenesis,
indicating that antagonism of GSK3h activity is oncogenic for
mammary epithelial cells (6). In a mouse epidermal multistage
carcinogenesis model, Leis et al. (41) show a dramatic increase in
pGSK3h (Ser9) in late papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
Furthermore, a significant decrease in pGSK3h (Tyr216) is observed
in squamous cell carcinoma samples (41), indicating an inactivation of GSK3h during mouse skin carcinogenesis. Together, these
observations support the notion that GSK3h is a negative regulator
of skin tumorigenesis; down-regulation or inactivation of GSK3h is
oncogenic for epidermal cells.
The mechanisms underlying skin tumorigenesis are complex and
involve interactions among multiple signal cascades and various
transcription factors. Our study clearly shows that GSK3h is an
important component in the cascades, and modulation of GSK3h
expression/activity is sufficient to alter the transformation
potential of epidermal cells. Thus, GSK3h is a target for developing
prevention/intervention strategies. GSK3h has emerged as an
attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple
neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer’s and stroke. Lithium has
been used as a mood stabilizer to treat bipolar mood disorder, and
other inhibitors of GSK3h have entered clinical trials for diabetes.
The potential role of these inhibitors in tumorigenesis should be
considered.
