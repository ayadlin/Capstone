Abstract
Use of kinase inhibitors in cancer therapy leads invariably to
acquired resistance stemming from kinase reprogramming. To
overcome the dynamic nature of kinase adaptation, we asked
whether a signal-integrating downstream effector might exist that
provides a more applicable therapeutic target. In this study, we
reported that the transcriptional factor c-Myc functions as a
downstream effector to dictate the therapeutic response to c-Met
inhibitors in c-Met–addicted cancer and derived resistance. Dissociation of c-Myc from c-Met control, likely overtaken by a

variety of reprogrammed kinases, led to acquisition of drug
resistance. Notably, c-Myc blockade by RNA interference or pharmacologic inhibition circumvented the acquired resistance to cMet inhibition. Combining c-Myc blockade and c-Met inhibition
in MET-ampliﬁed patient-derived xenograft mouse models
heightened therapeutic activity. Our ﬁndings offer a preclinical
proof of concept for the application of c-Myc–blocking agents as a
tactic to thwart resistance to kinase inhibitors. Cancer Res; 75(21);

Introduction

negative breast cancer cells (10). As such, although combination
therapy to concurrently diminish provoked kinases has been
accepted as a therapeutic strategy to overcome kinase resistance
(11, 12), the application of this strategy is indeed more complicated than it appears.
Recently, in-depth analysis of kinases signaling network has
revealed that divergent kinases signaling pathways often converge
on common downstream effectors to modulate cell survival
(13–15). For example, EGFR-mutant non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), Bcr-Abl–translocated chronic myeloid leukemia,
HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer, BRAF-mutant melanoma, and
EML4-ALK–translocated NSCLC all require proapoptotic BH3only protein Bim to mediate apoptosis resulted from kinases
inhibition (16–20). Elevation of Bim indicates the therapeutic
outcomes of target inhibition, whereas Bim silence is associated
with loss of therapeutic efﬁcacy (21–24). These evidence triggers
an increasing appreciation of a "kinase downstream effector"
paradigm in kinase-addicted cancer, where these downstream
effectors integrate the complexity of upstream kinase signaling
network to regulate cell growth and provide "fragile points" of
kinase-addicted cancer (25). To date, it remains unknown whether the same paradigm exists in kinase addiction–derived resistance. To identify fragile points of acquired resistance, if any, will
gain valuable therapeutic opportunities for acquired resistance
and bring a conceptual breakthrough in resistant management in
kinase-targeted therapy.
To address this question, we herein take c-Met, a receptor
tyrosine kinase aberrantly overactivated in many solid tumors
and associated with poor prognosis (26, 27), as a representative
target to discover whether there exists a "fragile point" in acquired
resistance of c-Met–addicted cancer. Indeed, this study has discovered that c-Myc serves as a downstream effector that critically
converges upstream signaling to drive cell growth in both c-Met–
addicted cancer and derived resistance. Translationally, while
disturbing c-Myc will provide therapeutic options for overcoming

Despite the remarkable clinical success, the major challenge for
targeted therapy lies in quick acquisition of acquired resistance
(1–4). Various molecular mechanisms of resistance have been
revealed, including gatekeeper mutations, ampliﬁcation or overexpression of target genes, or modiﬁcation of signaling pathways.
Among them, activation of compensatory kinase(s), which allows
cancer cells overriding the response to target inhibition, has been
frequently observed (5–7). For example, resistance to the EGFR
inhibitor geﬁtinib can result from MET ampliﬁcation, HER2
ampliﬁcation, or upregulation of kinases like IGFR, FGFR, or AXL
(6, 8). The arising compensatory kinases seem to be highly
variable, suggesting kinome-wide changes in tumor cells following pharmacologic or genetic pressures. Indeed, human kinome
that features inherent plasticity and robustness undergoes rapid
and dynamic remodeling known as "kinome reprogramming,"
which allows circumventing the effects of selective kinases inhibitors (9). For example, MEK inhibition caused acute ERK activity
loss but induced a dynamic reprogramming of kinome in triple-

Targeting c-Myc Is Sufﬁcient to Overcome c-Met Resistance

acquired resistance to c-Met inhibition, c-Myc also serves as a
functional molecular probe to inspect the response to c-Met
inhibitors, monitor the emergence of acquired resistance, and
assess the effectiveness of alternative therapies. Our study has
proved the fundamental role of c-Myc in directing clinical decision-making in c-Met–targeted cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
EBC-1, BGC-823, MKN-1, MKN-28, and MKN-74 cells were
obtained from Japanese Research Resources Bank. MKN-45 and
BaF3 cells were obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. HCC827 and HCC827/
GR6 were kindly gifted by Dr. Pasi A. J€anne (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Boston, MA). Other cell lines used in this study were
obtained from the ATCC and authenticated by short tandem
repeat (STR) testing. All the cell lines were maintained in appropriate medium as suppliers suggested.
(þ)-JQ1 and ()-JQ1 were kindly provided by Dr. James E.
Bradner (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and the other inhibitors
were obtained from Selleck Chemicals. SGX-523 and PF-2341066
for in vivo studies were obtained from Haoyuan Chemexpress Co.,
Ltd. 17-DMAG for in vivo studies was obtained from LC Laboratories. All these reagents were dissolved in DMSO for in vitro
studies and in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SGX-523)
or sterile PBS (PF-2341066 and 17-DMAG) for in vivo studies.
DNA construction, virus production, and infection
The retroviral constructs MSCV-Myc, pBABE-TPR-MET, and
empty vectors were obtained from Addgene. pBABE-TPR-MET
(L290T) was constructed with a site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Sbsbio). To generate cells with stable expression, the plasmids
were transfected into amphotropic phoenix 293T packaging cells
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 hours, viruscontaining medium was collected, ﬁltered, and used to infect
host cells in the presence of 6 mg/mL of polybrene. The stable
transfectants were obtained by selection with 1 mg/mL puromycin (Sigma) for 2 weeks followed by immunoblotting validation.
Generation of c-Met–resistant cells
To generate cells resistant to c-Met inhibition, EBC-1 cells were
exposed to SGX-523 at concentrations increased stepwisely from
10 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L when the cells resumed growth kinetics
similar to the untreated parental cells. After about 6 months, a
resistant subpopulation called EBC-1/SR were obtained and the
resistant cells were maintained in the presence of SGX-523 at 1
mmol/L for another 2 months. After several passages in drug-free
conditions, the resistant cells retained their resistant phenotype as
determined by cell viability assay. Parental cells were maintained
concomitantly without SGX-523, and no signiﬁcant change in the
sensitivity was noted during the period.
Animal studies
Four- to 6-week-old nu/nu athymic BALB/c mice were obtained
from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All studies were done in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica. Tumors were
generated by transplanting 5  106 tumor cells resuspended in
PBS (200 mL/mouse) into the right ﬂank. Prior to initiation of

treatment, mice were randomized among control and treated
groups (n ¼ 6 per group). For efﬁcacy studies, mice were treated
with drugs using the indicated doses. For combination treatment,
both drugs were given concurrently. The average tumor diameter
(two perpendicular axes of the tumor were measured) was measured in control and treated groups with Vernier calipers every 3
days. For statistical analysis, data were analyzed by the unpaired
two-tailed Student t test and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. To prepare lysates, mice were sacriﬁced and tumor
tissues were resected and homogenized in cold RIPA lysis buffer
(Beyotime) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Merck) and then processed for immunoblotting.
Animal studies using patient-derived xenograft models were
conducted by Crown Bioscience and in strict accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH
(Bethesda, MD).

Results
Multiple kinases are involved in resistance acquisition to c-Met
inhibition
Accumulated evidence has suggested the role of MET ampliﬁcation in rendering c-Met–addicted cell growth (28–31). We
ﬁrstly conﬁrmed this by interrogating a panel of NSCLC and
gastric cancer cells with SGX-523, a highly selective c-Met kinase
inhibitor (32). Indeed, cell lines harboring MET ampliﬁcation
showed constitutively activated c-Met and accordingly showed
exquisite sensitivity to c-Met inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1A–
S1C). c-Met–addicted EBC-1 cells were then selected to generate
acquired resistance. The resultant cells, designated as EBC-1/SR,
showed at least 500-fold reduced sensitivity to SGX-523 and crossresistance to other putative c-Met inhibitors PHA-665752, PF2341066, and XL-880 as well (Fig. 1A). The copy number of MET
proto-oncogene in EBC-1/SR cells was identical to that of parental
cells (Fig. 1B); meanwhile, c-Met phosphorylation was effectively
inhibited by SGX-523 (Fig. 1C). These data ruled out the possibilities of resistance resulted from loss of MET ampliﬁcation or
occurrence of c-Met mutations that decreased the afﬁnity for
kinase inhibitors.
Obviously, SGX-523 failed to block AKT and ERK signaling in
EBC-1/SR cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that alternative kinase(s)
should be engaged in the resistance acquisition. To identify
compensatory kinases in resistant cells, we conducted phospho-receptor tyrosine kinases arrays to compare the phosphorylation status in the parental and resistant cells. The phosphorylation of multiple kinases, including PDGFR, TYRO10, Tyk2, CSK,
VEGFR, etc., was increased in the resistant cells, suggesting the
activation of multiple kinases upon resistance occurrence (Fig.
1D). Next-generation sequencing and genome-wide copy number
analyses revealed that none of driving point mutation, ampliﬁcation, or fusion was detected in the genome of resistant cells,
largely excluding the self-activation of these kinases (data not
shown). We then asked whether ligand-mediated activation of
kinases contributed to the resistant phenotype. Indeed, proﬁling
of the secreted proteins with high-density antibody arrays showed
increased level of multiple cytokines and growth factors, such as
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), VEGF, nerve growth factor,
placental growth factor, etc., in the culture medium of resistant
cells (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Table S1). These data suggested that
the acquired resistance to c-Met inhibition may arise from ligandmediated activation of multiple kinases in the resistant cells.

Targeting c-Myc Is Sufﬁcient to Overcome c-Met Resistance

For further conﬁrmation, we probed sensitivity of resistant cells
to a panel of kinase inhibitors, alone or in combination with SGX523 (Supplementary Table S2). As expected, kinase inhibitors
speciﬁcally targeting PDGFR, FGFR, EGFR, etc., failed to suppress
the growth of resistant cells even when combined with SGX-523.
Instead, multitarget kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and PP121, were able to inhibit cell growth. Likewise, simultaneous
disruption of multiple kinases by targeting Hsp90 using 17DMAG and ganetaspib circumvented the resistance in EBC-1/SR
cells (Fig. 1F). Similar results were obtained in another generated
resistant MKN-45/SR cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Together, our data suggest that concomitant inhibition of
kinase complements responsible for resistance acquisition to cMet inhibition is largely challenged by such dynamic reprogrammed nature of kinome, particularly considering the lack of
clinically applicable inhibitors of some aroused kinases.
c-Myc determines the biologic response of c-Met inhibition in
MET-addicted cancer cells
Inspired by the evidence that kinase inhibition only achieves
therapeutic outcomes when the signaling attenuation is delivered
to downstream effectors, which regulates ultimate cell survival, we
asked whether it is possible to identify such downstream molecules of the c-Met signaling pathway, namely a "fragile point" of
both c-Met–addicted cancer and its derived resistance. To this end,
we ﬁrst probed c-Met–driven cellular processes in c-Met–addicted
EBC-1 and MKN-45 cells by global transcriptional proﬁling, using
HCC827 cells with activated c-Met but lacking MET ampliﬁcation
as a negative control (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Bioinformatic
annotations classiﬁed the substantially modulated genes by SGX523 treatment into three major biologic processes, namely cellcycle regulation, DNA replication, and cell metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S2B), which were conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry
detected G1–S arrest, reduced in situ EdU incorporation, and
impaired lactate secretion, respectively (Supplementary Fig.
S2C–S2E). These data suggested that c-Met blockade in c-Met–
addicted cells led to a state of proliferation arrest.
Stalled cell-cycle progression at G1–S phase is likely an integrated
outcome resulting from impaired cell proliferation and metabolism. Thus, the major cell-cycle regulators involved in G1–S transition were probed upon c-Met inhibition in four MET-ampliﬁed
cell lines (EBC-1, NCI-H1993, SNU-5, and MKN-45), with
HCC827 cells as a negative control. After treatment with SGX523 for 24 and 48 hours, c-Met phosphorylation was equally
abolished in all cell lines, but the G1–S regulators were affected
only in cells sensitive to c-Met inhibition. Intriguingly, we found
that the alteration of G1–S transition regulators, such as CDK4,
CDK6, cyclin D1, and P27, all varied among the cell lines. Only the
transcription factor c-Myc was unanimously abolished across all
MET-ampliﬁed cell lines (Fig. 2A). This ﬁnding was further conﬁrmed by expanding to other c-Met inhibitors (Supplementary Fig.
S2F) or disrupting c-Met expression using siRNAs (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the decreased c-Myc level upon c-Met inhibition was found to
be a coordination of transcriptional suppression and compromised
protein stability (Supplementary Fig. S2G–S2J), suggesting a role in
integrating upstream signaling. We hypothesized that c-Myc is a
candidate molecule that possibly dictates the blockade of G1–S
transition upon c-Met inhibition in MET-ampliﬁed cancer cells.
To further test this possibility, we treated EBC-1 cells with JQ1,
which suppress c-Myc transcription by targeting BET bromodomain (33, 34). As expected, the treatment of JQ1 dramatically

www.aacrjournals.org

downregulated c-Myc expression and inhibited the survival of
EBC-1 cells despite the activated c-Met signaling (Fig. 2C). Likewise, c-Myc siRNA largely inhibited cell growth and induced G1
phase arrest (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2K), suggesting that
solely c-Myc inhibition could override active c-Met–driven cell
growth. Moreover, ectopic expression of c-Myc into EBC-1 cells
largely rescued the growth delay caused by c-Met inhibition (Fig.
2E). In vivo, mice bearing EBC-1 xenograft models were treated
with SGX-523 at 10 or 20 mg/kg twice a day for 15 consecutive
days. Along with the strikingly inhibited tumor growth, intratumoral c-Myc level was consistently and profoundly decreased after
SGX-523 treatment, and c-Myc downregulation was detectable as
earlier as on day 3 (Fig. 2F and G).
Together, these results indicated that c-Myc downregulation is
essential for determining the biologic response of c-Met inhibition in MET-addicted cancer cells. c-Myc serves as a downstream
effector that critically converges c-Met signaling to drive c-Met–
dependent cell growth.
c-Myc is coupled to c-Met to control cell growth in MET-addicted
cells
It appeared that the activated c-Met signaling in c-Met–addicted
cells establishes an association with c-Myc for controlling cell
growth. For conﬁrmation, we generated "gain-of-MET addiction"
using BaF3 cells, whose survival dependence will switch from IL3
to established oncogenic kinase (35). Once TPR-MET fusion was
introduced into BaF3 cells, the resultant BaF3/TPR-MET cells were
no longer dependent on IL3 for cell survival (Fig. 3A) and
exhibited a profound sensitivity to SGX-523 (Fig. 3B), indicative
of gain-of-MET addiction. Notably, IL3 deprival that caused c-Myc
reduction in BaF3 cells was not observed following the introduction of TPR-MET (Fig. 3C). In contrast, inactivation of c-Met by
SGX-523 in BaF3/TPR-MET cells led to a dramatic reduction in the
c-Myc level (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that c-Myc is incorporated into c-Met signaling to govern cell growth upon gain-of-MET
addiction.
To further conﬁrm the observed association between c-Met and
c-Myc in BaF3/TPR-MET cells, a strategy using gatekeeper mutation of TPR-MET kinase domain plus inhibitors with different
modes of action was used to "switch off" or "turn on" c-Met
signaling. The gatekeeper residue was identiﬁed by aligning the
kinase domain of c-Met and that of ALK, EGFR, and ABL (36–38).
Leucine 1157 (L1157) in the kinase domain of c-Met was identiﬁed as a candidate gatekeeper residue (Fig. 3E). As expected,
substitution of the same residue leucine 290 in TPR-MET with
threonine (T), termed TPR-MET (L290T), conferred more than
100-fold resistance to SGX-523 compared with BaF3/TPR-MET
cells (Fig. 3F). Along with loss of c-Met inhibition by SGX-523, cMyc level was restored in the mutant cells (Fig. 3G). In contrast,
ARQ-197, a non–ATP-competitive c-Met inhibitor (39), effectively inactivated c-Met signaling and inhibited cell growth of TPRMET (L290T) cells (Fig. 3F). Upon the switch off of c-Met
signaling, c-Myc expression was largely diminished by ARQ197 in TPR-MET (L290T) cells (Fig. 3G). These data together
demonstrated that c-Myc is stringently coupled to c-Met to control
cell growth in c-Met–addicted cells.
Loss of c-Myc regulation by c-Met leads to resistance to c-Met
inhibition
Our results so far have demonstrated the critical role of c-Myc in
mediating c-Met–addicted cell growth. It will be critical to know

whether c-Myc retains growth control in cells with developed
resistance to c-Met inhibition. Intriguingly, c-Myc disruption
using siRNA resulted in effective proliferation inhibition in
EBC-1/SR cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that resistant cells remained
highly dependent on c-Myc. Similar results were recapitulated by
blocking c-Myc using JQ1 (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, c-Myc protein
level remained intact when exposing EBC-1/SR cells to SGX-523

inhibition. Nevertheless, these cells remained dependent on cMyc for cell survival.
c-Myc is a growth-regulatory oncoprotein itself, and there is a
possibility that c-Myc reactivation accounts for cell growth independent of c-Met activity. In particular, we observed an elevated cMyc level in EBC-1/SR cells (Fig. 4C). We measured MYC gene
locus in the resistant cells. No alteration of MYC gene copy was
observed (Fig. 4D), which largely ruled out the self-activation of cMyc. Instead, we found an increased mRNA level in the resistant

cells (Fig. 4E) and reactivation of signaling molecules like AKT
and ERK (Fig. 4C). Together with the multiple activated kinase
in EBC-1/SR cells (shown in Fig. 1), we speculated that c-Myc
regulation in EBC-1/SR cells was overtaken by other compensatory kinase(s), which in turn drove cell growth independent
of c-Met activity. Consistently, Hsp90 inhibitors were able to
effectively diminish the expression of c-Myc alone or in combination with SGX-523 (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, in the EBC-1/SR
xenograft model, mice barely responded to SGX-523 treatment
as expected. In agreement, the intratumoral level of c-Myc
following treatment was marginally affected by SGX-523,
whereas combination of SGX-523 with the Hsp90 inhibitor
17-DMAG largely decreased the c-Myc level along with strikingly suppressed tumor growth (Fig. 4G and H). These data
together suggested that c-Myc retains growth control in c-Met–
resistant cells, regardless of the switched growth dependency
from c-Met to other compensatory kinases.

Then, we proceeded to examine whether c-Myc is dynamically
governed in the process of resistance acquisition in c-Met–
addicted cells. To mimic the dynamics of resistance acquisition
in clinical treatment, EBC-1 cells were treated with SGX-523 at 1
mmol/L every 3 days for up to 4 months. The sensitivity of cells to
SGX-523 and JQ1 and the status of phosphorylated c-Met and cMyc were simultaneously monitored on days 0, 3, 15, 30, 60, 90,
and 120, respectively (Fig. 4I). As expected, cells exhibited increasingly declined sensitivity to SGX-523. The IC50 increased more
than 300-fold from 10 nmol/L to more than 30 mmol/L after 4month treatment, although the copy number of MET protooncogene remained the same and phosphorylation of c-Met was
constantly abolished (Fig. 4J and K). Despite the gradually lost
growth control of c-Met kinase, c-Myc dominated the cell growth
throughout the whole process, as suggested by a constant sensitivity to JQ1 (Fig. 4J). Importantly, there appeared a dynamic
transition of c-Myc regulation along with the development of

c-Myc is dispensable for cell survival of other kinase
addiction
It is important to know whether c-Myc is selectively coupled to
c-Met or generally serves as an effector for oncogenic kinases in
controlling cell growth. To address this question, we treated
HCC827 cells that are solely addicted to EGFR with both geﬁtinib
and EGFR siRNA. We found that EGFR inhibition by either
geﬁtinib or EGFR siRNA caused a dramatic decrease in the c-Myc
level (Fig. 5A and B). Importantly, knockdown of EGFR per se
signiﬁcantly inhibited cell growth of HCC827 cells. However,
knockdown of c-Myc alone failed to impact cell growth of
HCC827 cells (Fig. 5B).

Similar results were obtained in B-RAF V600E mutation–
addicted A375 cells. Inhibition of B-RAF signaling in A375 cells
by either PLX-4032 or B-RAF siRNA resulted in c-Myc reduction.
However, disruption of c-Myc using siRNA only slightly affected
cell viability of B-RAF–addicted cancer cells, in contrast to B-RAF
siRNA, which led to a dramatic inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 5C).
For further conﬁrmation, we extended to HCC827/GR6 cells, a
cell derived from HCC827 cells, and simultaneously addicted to
ampliﬁed MET and mutant EGFR (40, 41). We found that
although combined treatment with SGX-523 and geﬁtinib largely
inhibited cell growth and decreased the c-Myc level in HCC827/
GR6 cells (Fig. 5D), depletion of c-Myc also failed to substantially

dependency on cell survival is restricted to c-Met–addicted cancer
cells.
c-Myc directs clinical decision-making in MET-oriented clinical
treatment
Our data thus far implied the important clinical applications
of c-Myc in c-Met–targeted cancer therapy. Given the strictly
limited accessibility to clinical test of c-Met inhibitors, we
alternatively resorted to patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, which faithfully recapitulate tumor heterogeneity and histologic characteristics of primary tumors, to mimic the clinical
settings (42–44).
We started with screening Hubase, a database composed of
genetic background of more than 300 patient tumors covering a
variety of cancer types (Supplementary Table S3), to seek PDX
models with MET ampliﬁcation (copy number higher than 5).
As shown, NSCLC represents the major cancer type harboring
MET ampliﬁcation, and we also found that other tumor types
such as gastric cancer, liver cancer, and esophageal cancer bear
MET ampliﬁcation (Table 1). A cohort of 7 MET-ampliﬁed PDX
models, which represented 7 individual patients eligible for cMet orientated one-arm trial, was selected for the treatment of
the c-Met inhibitor. Mice were treated with PF-2341066, a
clinically available c-Met inhibitor, at 12.5 or 25 mg/kg once
a day for 21 consecutive days and tumor volume was examined
every 3 days. Intriguingly, only 4 of 7 PDX models responded to
PF-2341066, including three NSCLC models (LU-2503,
LU1901, and LU0858) and one liver cancer model (LI0612;
Table 1). Accordingly, intratumoral c-Myc expression in responders was reduced upon treatment, and downregulation was
detectable as early as on day 3 (Fig. 6A and B; Supplementary
Fig. S3A). In contrast, the c-Myc level remained constant in the
nonresponders, although c-Met phosphorylation was similarly
decreased (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Fig. S3B). These data suggested that MET ampliﬁcation, although accepted as a predictive biomarker and currently used as criteria for patient enrollment clinically, is not able to ensure the responsiveness to cMet–targeted therapy. Inspection of the c-Myc level enabled us
to distinguish nonresponders from c-Met inhibitors at the
earliest stage of the treatment.
To further mirror the clinical scenario, the responder LU2503
was continuously treated until loss of responsiveness. As often
occurs clinically, this model developed resistance after consecutive treatment with PF-2341066 at 12.5 mg/kg once a day for
about 2 months, and the treatment was terminated thereafter. It
was observed that the reduced c-Myc level was restored again by
the treatment (Fig. 6D). Consistently, in an LU1901-derived
resistant model called LU1901-R1, combined treatment with
PF-2341066 and the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG effectively sup-

4556 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

pressed tumor growth and decreased c-Myc expression. These data
suggested that c-Myc expression is able to predict resistance
occurrence and monitor the efﬁcacy of alternative therapies (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D).
Collectively, such a PDX-based study that mirrors clinical
management has proved that to inspect the c-Myc level will
assist clinical decision-making in c-Met–targeted therapy in
determining ultimate response, indicating the occurrence of
acquired resistance, and predicting the effectiveness of alternative therapies.

Discussion
In the current study, we discovered that multiple kinases were
simultaneously implicated in the acquisition of resistance to cMet inhibition. Moreover, the kinases arising in our study were
not overlapped with those reported by others, namely HER family
and BRAF fusion (45, 46). As such, the identiﬁcation of kinase
signaling complements responsible for resistance acquisition in
each cellular context seems difﬁcult and nearly impossible. Alternatively, we found that c-Myc functions as a common downstream effector to sustain growth advantage in both c-Met–
addicted cancers and acquired resistance. Congruent with this
notion, targeting c-Met– and Hsp90-associated multiple kinases
can modulate c-Myc expression and ultimately cell survival in cMet–addicted and –resistant cells, respectively. Notably, depletion of c-Myc pharmacologically (JQ1) or genetically (siRNA)
provided a powerful approach to overcome resistance to c-Met
inhibition. Although inhibitors directly targeting c-Myc remain
unavailable, our ﬁndings suggested that disrupting a "c-Myc–like"
kinase-associated downstream effector, rather than identifying all
possible compensatory kinases, may give rise to a successful proof
of concept of circumventing acquired resistance in a broader range
of kinase-addicted cancers.
Being a fragile point in both c-Met–addicted and acquired
resistant cells enables c-Myc as a probe to indicate response and
resistance for c-Met inhibitors. Indeed, our PDX-based co-clinical
trial witnessed the clinical power of c-Myc for c-Met–targeted
therapy. After enrollment of MET ampliﬁed "patients," the alteration of c-Myc level allowed us to stratify the nonresponder at the
beginning of treatment (on the third day), thereby avoiding delay
in starting alternative treatment. For the responders proceeding to
the treatment, the serial detection of c-Myc predicted the emerging
resistance before tumor relapse and further dictated response to
alternative therapies. These suggested that c-Myc can serve as a
functional response biomarker to guide the clinical trial of c-Met–
targeted therapy (Fig. 6E).
The coming challenge of our ﬁndings lies in how to facilitate
detecting c-Myc in clinic. While collection of patient biopsies
serially seems unreasonable, it is of urgent need to develop

clinically applicable tools to image c-Myc in a noninvasive manner. Molecular imaging probes that directly binding to c-Myc is
not available to date; however, a recent report has shown significant progress in this regard. It demonstrated that using 89Zrtransferrin PET scans to track TFRC expression, a downstream
reporter of c-Myc expression, can quantitatively annotate c-Myc
status, which makes the molecular imaging of c-Myc possible,
although indirect, for the beneﬁt of assessing response and
resistance for c-Met–targeted therapy in patients (47).
Taken together, the recognition of a new paradigm as "kinasedownstream effector" can help us understand both kinase addiction and resistance acquisition. Interrupting these key effectors
will give rise to powerful approaches to overcome acquired
resistance. Moreover, integrating downstream effectors into clinic
enables a more advanced and precise decision-making to beneﬁt
the patients by optimizing treatment design and increases the
success of kinase inhibitors in clinical practice.
