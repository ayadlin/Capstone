Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a desmoplastic reaction that creates a dense ﬁbroinﬂammatory
microenvironment, promoting hypoxia and limiting cancer drug delivery due to decreased blood perfusion.
Here, we describe a novel tumor–stroma interaction that may help explain the prevalence of desmoplasia in this
cancer. Speciﬁcally, we found that activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) by tumor hypoxia strongly
activates secretion of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) ligand by cancer cells, which in turn causes stromal ﬁbroblasts to
increase ﬁbrous tissue deposition. In support of this ﬁnding, elevated levels of HIF-1a and SHH in pancreatic
tumors were determined to be markers of decreased patient survival. Repeated cycles of hypoxia and desmoplasia
ampliﬁed each other in a feed forward loop that made tumors more aggressive and resistant to therapy. This loop
could be blocked by HIF-1a inhibition, which was sufﬁcient to block SHH production and hedgehog signaling.
Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that increased HIF-1a produced by hypoxic tumors triggers the desmoplasic
reaction in pancreatic cancer, which is then ampliﬁed by a feed forward loop involving cycles of decreased blood
ﬂow and increased hypoxia. Our ﬁndings strengthen the rationale for testing HIF inhibitors and may therefore
represent a novel therapeutic option for pancreatic cancer. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3235–47. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with the majority
of patients succumbing within 1 year of diagnosis (1). Surgical
resection offers the only curative therapy but is an option for
less than 20% of patients and yields actuarial 5-year survival
rates of only about 20% (2). Treatment failure due to local
recurrence and hepatic metastases can occur within 1 to 2
years after surgery (3). Other treatment options including
gemcitabine and erlotinib offer only a small survival advantage
(4), and the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with
pancreatic cancer across all stages remains 0.4% to 4%, making
pancreatic cancer one of the top causes of death from cancer in
the Western world (5).
A characteristic of pancreatic cancer is extensive desmoplasia comprising a dense stromal ﬁbroinﬂammatory reaction
of ﬁbroblasts, inﬂammatory cells, and tumor vasculature (6).

Desmoplasia leads to decreased blood supply, poor drug delivery (7), and hypoxia (8). Although hypoxia presents a particularly hostile environment for cell growth, cancer cells are able
to adapt and survive by increasing the expression of genes
responsible for anaerobic metabolism, cell survival, metastasis,
and formation of new blood vessels (9). The cellular response to
hypoxia is mediated through a rapid increase in the levels of the
transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and
HIF-2. HIFs are heterodimers of inducible a- and constitutive
b-subunits. The importance of HIF-1a to pancreatic cancer is
directly shown by the resistance to chemotherapy and radiation seen in pancreatic cancer cells constitutively expressing
HIF-1a and their increased in vivo tumorigenicity (8).
Recent evidence shows that expression of sonic hedgehog
(SHH) ligand contributes to the formation of desmoplasia in
pancreatic cancer and that paracrine hedgehog (HH) signaling
plays an important role in the communication between tumor
and stroma cells and promotes tumorigenesis (10–13). Hedgehog signaling is initiated by binding of SHH ligand to the
Patched-1 receptor (PTCH1) that relieves repression of the
transducer protein Smoothened (SMO), thus triggering activation of the GLI family of transcription factors. Genes activated by GLI include GLI-1 itself, PTCH1, and depending on the
cell type, genes upregulating cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and through SNAIL the epithelial–mesenchymal transition of metastasis (14).
Altered hedgehog signaling has been implicated in the
development of approximately 20% to 25% of all cancers and
has been classiﬁed into 2 major types (15, 16). The ﬁrst type
includes mutations in hedgehog network genes resulting in

hedgehog ligand-independent tumors, they include PTCHinactivating mutations, SMO-activating mutations, or loss of
RENKCTD11, a GLI antagonist, in medulloblastoma (16, 17). The
second type is hedgehog ligand-dependent tumors characterized by aberrant expression of hedgehog ligand that is observed
especially in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (including
pancreas), breast, colon, and prostate (16, 18). In some cases,
the tumors have been proposed to respond to hedgehog ligand
in an autocrine manner as hedgehog ligand has been found to
be both produced by the tumor cells and to activate them (16).
In contrast, others have described paracrine models where the
hedgehog ligand is produced by the tumor cells (hedgehogproducing cells) but acts on the ﬁbroblasts and stellate cells
in the stroma (hedgehog-responding cells; refs. 10–13, 19).
SHH and downstream components of the hedgehog signaling pathway have been shown to be present in precursor
lesions and primary pancreatic tumors but not in normal
pancreas, suggesting that hedgehog signaling may play a role
in the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer (20–22).
This concept is supported by the ﬁnding that mouse transgenic
models with SHH expressed in pancreatic epithelium, together
with mutant KRAS, show an enhanced incidence of pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia and increased lethality (23). Furthermore, expression of SHH in transformed primary pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells in an orthotopic model of pancreatic
cancer leads to increased desmoplasia (11). Inhibition of
hedgehog signaling was shown to enhance vascular density
and delivery of chemotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic
cancer (24) and to inhibit tumor initiation and metastasis in
orthotopic xenografts established from human pancreatic
cancer cell lines (25).
Although it has become clear that aberrant activation of
hedgehog signaling either by mutations or ligand overexpression can lead to cancer, the mechanisms responsible for
regulating SHH expression in human cancer are poorly understood (26–28). We show here that hypoxia, acting through HIF1a is responsible for the increase in SHH in pancreatic cancer
cells. Moreover, we show a positive correlation between HIF1a and SHH expression in human pancreatic cancer and in a
retrospective study that both predict for decreased patient
survival. In addition, we found that the SHH secreted by
pancreatic cancer cells in hypoxia acts in a paracrine manner
to increase GLI activation, and the formation of collagen 1 and
ﬁbronectin, markers of desmoplasia by ﬁbroblasts. The studies
suggest that increased HIF-1a could be an initiating factor in
the desmoplasia of pancreatic cancer, which is ampliﬁed by
cycles of decreased blood ﬂow, increased hypoxia and further
desmoplasia.

(Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Anti-actin (I-19) antibody
was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAG (antiDDK) antibody was from Origene. Anti-collagen 1 and antiﬁbronectin antibodies used for immunoﬂuorescence and
immunohistochemistry were from Abcam Inc. SAG was from
Enzo Life Sciences. PX-478, a HIF-1a inhibitor (29) was
synthesized by the MD Anderson Translational Chemistry
Core Service (Houston, TX). GDC-0449 was from Selleck
Chemicals.
Cells
All cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type
Culture Collection. Panc-1, SU.86.86, Capan-2, and MiaPaCa2 are human pancreatic cancer cells. NIH-3T3/GLI-luc (SHHLight II; ref. 30) is a mouse NIH-3T3 cell line stably transfected
with a GLI-responsive Fireﬂy luciferase reporter and a constitutive Renilla luciferase expression vector. 293 EcR SHH (31)
are human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells carrying a stably
integrated murine SHH under ecdysone-inducible control.
Cells were grown in humidiﬁed 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 C in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS. All cell lines were tested to be Mycoplasma free
using a PCR ELISA Kit (Roche Diagnostics Inc.). Cell line lineage was conﬁrmed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Characterized Cell Line Core Service.
Human pancreatic cancer immunohistochemistry
A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from parafﬁnembedded tumor blocks using an indexed manual tissue
arrayer (Advanced EDM Automation). When tissue was available, cases were triple-punched with 1.0-mm core needles to
include 2 tumor cores and 1 adjacent normal core. Only
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous, and
carcinoma were used in this analysis (n ¼ 129) though not
all samples were evaluated for all markers. Hematoxylin and
eosin–stained slides were reviewed by a pathologist (G. Hostetter) and desired regions marked and transferred to the
donor parafﬁn blocks. The master TMA blocks were sectioned
at 5-mm thickness and water ﬂotation used for tissue section
transfer. TMA slides were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected
to heat-induced epitope retrieval with EDTA solution for 30
minutes using a BondMax autostainer (Leica Microsystems,
Inc.). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked and the slide was
incubated for 30 minutes with HIF-1a or SHH antibody (25
mg/mL) and visualized by the Bond Polymer Reﬁne Detection
Kit (Leica Microsystems) using diaminobenzidine chromogen
as substrate. IHC staining localization was evaluated in adenocarcinoma and in peritumoral stroma separately. The vasculature was not included in the stromal component. Staining
intensity was scored blinded on a scale of 0 to 3 with a score of
3 indicating strong staining. In cases where staining was
heterogeneous for either compartment, the higher intensity
staining was scored. Survival information was missing for 4 of
129 patient samples in the dataset, and 11 were still alive.
Microarray
Gene expression microarray analyses were conducted
on RNA from MiaPaca2 wild-type cells transfected with

Hypoxia Mediates Hedgehog Signaling in Pancreatic Cancer

Dharmacon SMARTpool siRNA against HIF-1a (M-004018-05)
or control siRNA (D-001210-05) using DharmaFECT 2 (Dharmacon). HIF-1a knockdown efﬁcacy was determined by Western blotting (data not shown). RNA was isolated using the
Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and microarray analysis was
conducted on an Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 chip (Affymetrix). All correlations are signiﬁcant below the Bonferroni
cutoff of P ¼ 0.00217 (0.05 of 23 markers ¼ 0.00217).
Pentachrome staining
Pentachrome staining was carried out using the RussellMovat Pentachrome Stain Kit (American MasterTech, catalog
#KTRMP). Slides were deparafﬁnized with 3 30-minute immersion in xylene, followed by 2 2-minute rehydration rinses
through an alcohol series (100%, 95%, and 70%), and rinsed
in distilled water. Slides were placed in Verhoeff's Elastic Stain
for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute tap water rinse and
distilled water rinse. Elastic ﬁbers were differentiated in 2%
ferric chloride for 2 minutes (or until elastic ﬁbers are deﬁned).
Slides were rinsed in distilled water and placed in 5% sodium
thiosulfate for 1 minute. Slides were rinsed in tap water for 5
minutes, placed in 3% glacial acetic acid for 3 minutes, and then
moved to a 1% Alcian blue solution for 15 minutes. Slides were
rinsed in tap water, followed by distilled water, and placed in
crocein scarlet-acid fuchsin for 2 minutes. After 3 rinses of
distilled water and 5 sips in 1% glacial acetic acid slides were
placed in 2 changes of 5% phosphotungstic acid for 3 minutes
each. Slides were again dipped in 1% glacial acetic acid and
dehydrated in 3 changes of absolute alcohol. Slides were placed
in alcoholic saffron for 15 minutes, dehydrated in absolute
alcohol, followed by xylene, and coverslipped.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit
and RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted using either a human hedgehog
pathway array or speciﬁc human/mouse SYBR Green primers
for selected genes (SABioscience). The experiments were carried out using the RT2 First-Strand Kit and RT2 qPCR Master
Mix Reagents (SABioscience) and analyzed in triplicates on a
7300 real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Normalization and analyses were conducted using b2-microglobulin
(B2M) as the internal reference by the 2DDCT method (32).
Signiﬁcance was determined by analysis of variance or Student
t tests where appropriate.
Transfections and stable cell lines
MiaPaca2 and Panc-2 were stably transfected with shHIF-1a
using the siPORTamine and lipofectamine transfection
reagents, respectively. Clones were selected by growing the
cells in puromycin and HIF-1a expression was analyzed by
Western blotting. siRNAs to human SHH, HIF-1a, polo-likekinase (PLK), and the nontargeting siRNAs, On Target Plus 4
(OTP4) and scramble #5 (SMARTpool, Thermo Scientiﬁc
Dharmacon) were transfected into Panc-2 cells using the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used to transfect siRNA into Panc1 cells before
plating the cells on NanoCulture plates. Myc-DDK-HHIP

www.aacrjournals.org

(Origene, catalog number RC206868) was transfected into
Panc-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in 20 mol/L Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mol/L NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 2 mol/L EDTA, 1 mol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), and
protease inhibitors for 30 minutes on ice and spun at 13,000
rpm in a microcentrifuge for 15 minutes at 4 C. Proteins were
separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS
with 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with the appropriate antibodies
according to the manufacturer's recommendation and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence analysis.
Assays for hedgehog pathway activation
Activation of the hedgehog pathway in NIH-3T3/GLI-luc
ﬁbroblasts was measured in cocultures with pancreatic cancer
cells where NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells were plated at high density
(90  104 cells/well in 6-well plates) with or without MiaPaca
shV or MiaPaca shHIF-1a (50  104 cells/well) in complete
media. On the next day, media was replaced with DMEM
containing 0.5% serum and cells were placed in normoxia or
hypoxia (1% O2) for 3 additional days. Luciferase activity in cell
lysates was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay
system (Promega). To measure activation of the hedgehog
pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, cells were transiently
transfected with Cignal hedgehog reporter assay kit (SABiosciences) using the Lipofectamine 2000 and siPORTamine
transfection reagents for Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells, respectively. Luciferase was measured 48 hours posttransfection.
SHH was prepared from conditioned media of 293 EcR SHH
cells plated at 70% conﬂuency and grown for 1 day in normoxia
in DMEM containing 10% FBS and ponasterone. The conditioned media was then centrifuged to remove any remaining
cells. For 3-dimensional (3D) assays, tumor cells and ﬁbroblasts were cocultured on NanoCulture plates (SCIVAX Corp.).
NIH-3T3/GLI-luc (10  103 cells/well) and pancreatic cancer
cells (15  103 cells/well) were plated in 0.5% medium and 1%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for 5 days. For luciferase assay, 2 mL
luciferin (of 15 mg/mL stock) were added directly to media and
luciferase activity was measured in Xenogen IVIS Lumina
(Caliper LifeSciences). For qRT-PCR, cells were collected using
a multichannel pipet and RNA was isolated.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells were grown to conﬂuence on chamber glass slides with or without pancreatic tumor cells in
normoxia and hypoxia. One day after plating, the medium
was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for an additional
24 to 48 hours. Samples were ﬁxed in methanol/acetone at
20 C and subsequently stained with antibodies against
ﬁbronectin (1:250) and collagen I (1:500 dilution). Alexa Fluor
488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Invitrogen) was used as a secondary antibody.

Results
Tumor HIF-1a correlates with stromal SHH in human
pancreatic cancer
A representative IHC staining of desmoplasia in resected
pancreatic ductal carcinoma is shown in Fig. 1A(i) illustrating
the inﬁltrative tumor associated with large amounts of stroma
as compared with patient-matched adjacent stroma with
normal architecture and focal collagen bands (Fig. 1A
(ii)). Figure 1A(iii) shows metastatic pancreatic cancer with
staining for elastin, collagen, mucin, and inﬁltrative tumor. We
tested the correlation between the expression of tumor nuclear
HIF-1a as a marker of hypoxia, and stromal SHH as a marker
for hedgehog signaling, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ductal
adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma biopsy
cores scored on a TMA using IHC analysis. High expression
levels of SHH were detected in 63 of 98 (64%) evaluable
samples, and high expression levels of HIF-1a were detected
in 28 of 97 (29%) evaluable samples. Examples of staining for
HIF-1a and SHH in patient-matched TMA cores of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases with scoring in adenocarcinoma
and stromal component are shown in Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2. A positive correlation was found between tumor
HIF-1a and stromal SHH expression (Spearman ¼ 0.3254;
P ¼ 0.0015). In addition, HIF-1a staining in the tumor positively correlated with HIF-1a staining in the stroma (Spearman ¼ 0.5588; P < 0.0001), and with stromal carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) staining (Spearman ¼ 0.3187; P ¼ 0.0016;
Table 1). Other markers tested including PTCH, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, Bruton's
tyrosine kinase (BTK), mothers against decapentaplegic
(SMAD4), and RIO kinase 3 (RIOK3) did not correlate with either
HIF-1a or SHH in cytoplasm or stroma (Fig. 1B and Table 1).
High levels of tumor HIF-1a and stromal SHH are
associated with decreased patient survival
To examine the effect of HIF-1a and SHH expression on
survival, tumor nuclear HIF-1a and cytoplasmic SHH IHC
scores were divided into high (2.0) and low (< 2.0). We found
that a high HIF-1a nuclear score was associated with significantly shorter survival [median 253 compared with 405 days;
P ¼ 0.03 (log-rank); n ¼ 93; Fig. 1C]. Similarly, a high SHH score
was also associated with signiﬁcantly shorter survival [median
285 compared with 445 days; P ¼ 0.0087 (log-rank); n ¼ 91; Fig.
1D]. When patients with both high tumor nuclear HIF-1a and
stromal SHH scores were compared with patients with both
low tumor nuclear HIF-1a and stromal SHH scores, signiﬁcantly shorter survival was observed (median 248 days compared with 587 days; P ¼ 0.0032; Fig. 1E). No signiﬁcant
association was found between PTCH expression in either
tumor or stroma and survival (Supplementary Fig. S3). A Cox
proportional hazards model was used to study the effect of

3238

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

multiple covariates simultaneously. When cytoplasmic SHH
and nuclear HIF-1a expression levels are both in the model, a
signiﬁcant effect of cytoplasmic SHH expression on survival
was found, with HR ¼ 1.78 (P ¼ 0.0016), whereas the dichotomized nuclear HIF-1a had no signiﬁcant effect on survival
(P ¼ 0.12). Because the Cox proportional hazards model
effectively measures the effect of one variable at ﬁxed levels
of the other variables in the model, this might suggest that the
apparent effect of HIF-1a expression alone on patient survival
can be attributed to elevated SHH expression due to a positive
correlation between the 2 factors. In univariate analysis, the
conventional prognostic markers, pT category, T staging, and
the histologic grade are signiﬁcant (P < 0.05), whereas pN
category and M staging are marginally signiﬁcant for overall
survival (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Hypoxia induces SHH expression in pancreatic cancer
cells
To test the hypothesis that HIF-1a/hypoxia may be responsible for mediating the increase in SHH, we conducted a
transcriptome microarray study using MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic
cancer cells comparing genes transcribed in normoxia and 24
hours hypoxia (1% O2), and using siRNA to HIF-1a to determine
which genes were HIF-1a–dependent. We found 3 HH pathway
genes that showed signiﬁcant hypoxia/HIF-1a–dependent
induction, SHH ligand and 2 suppressors of the pathway,
PTCH1 and RENKCTD11 (Fig. 2A). qRT-PCR using a pathway
array proﬁling, the expression of 84 genes involved in hedgehog
signaling conﬁrmed the increased expression of SHH and
RENKCTD11 in hypoxia in MiaPaCa-2 cells, whereas PTCH1
showed only a small although consistent increase in hypoxia
(Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, qRT-PCR validation
conﬁrmed an increase in SHH and RENKCTD11 in the MiaPaca2,
Panc-1, Capan-2, and Su.86.86 pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig.
2B and C and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B).
Western blotting conﬁrmed a hypoxia-dependent increase
in SHH protein (Fig. 2D) and this was shown by shRNA
knockdown to be dependent on HIF-1a (Fig. 2D and E). A
time course analysis of the increase in SHH showed accumulation of SHH in hypoxia over a period of 3 days in both
MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C and
S4D). Even though we observed consistent increase in
RENKCTD11 RNA transcript levels in hypoxia, we were not able
to detect increased RENKCTD11 protein expression using Western blot or IHC analysis.
Hypoxia-induced SHH secretion by tumor cells results in
paracrine SHH/GLI-1 activation in ﬁbroblasts
Despite the hypoxic induction of SHH, MiaPaca-2 and Panc1 cells transfected with a GLI-luciferase reporter of hedgehog
activation showed no increase in GLI activity in either normoxia or hypoxia, suggesting the absence of autocrine stimulation of the cancer cells by SHH (Fig. 3A and B).
Typically, the role of hedgehog signaling in development is
mediated by paracrine effects on mesenchymal cells. In addition, it has been shown that tumors overexpressing hedgehog
ligands activate the signaling pathway in neighboring stroma
cells (10–13, 19). Hence, we next tested whether SHH secreted

HIF-1a- and SHH-dependent paracrine activation of
hedgehog pathway in a 3D coculture system
To further elucidate the mechanism of hedgehog signaling in
pancreatic cancer, we used a 3D culture system, which more
closely simulates conditions of in vivo tumor growth. Initial
characterization of the system was done with Panc-1 cells
stably expressing a luciferase reporter construct under the
control of a hypoxia response element (Panc HRE-luc). Panc-1
HRE-luc cells grown for 5 days in air on a 3D nano-matrix form
spheres (Fig. 4A) with a hypoxic core and upregulate HIF-1a
activity as shown by activation of the HRE-luc reporter (Fig. 4B
and C). Transfection of siHIF-1a inhibited the luciferase
activity in the spheres (Fig. 4B and C). To study hedgehog
activation in 3D cocultures of tumor cells and ﬁbroblasts, we
plated NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells together with either Panc-1,
MiaPaca-2, Capan-2, or Su.86.86 for 5 days, during which they
continued to proliferate and assembled into 3D structures
consisting of both pancreatic cancer cells and ﬁbroblasts (Fig.
4D). GLI transactivation measured by luciferase expression
was only found when the NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells were cocultured with Panc-1, MiaPaca-2, Capan-2, or Su.86.86 pancreatic
cancer cells but not when the NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells were
cultured alone (Fig. 4E).
Next, we conﬁrmed that activation of GLI in NIH-3T3
ﬁbroblasts cocultured with pancreatic tumor cells is mediated
by HIF-1a. We used Panc-1 cells that stably express shHIF-1a
and that have undetectable levels of HIF-1a as compared with
shVector cells (Fig. 2D). GLI-luc expression in the NIH-3T3
ﬁbroblasts was decreased when they were cocultured with
Panc-1 shHIF-1a cells as compared with Panc-1 shVector cells
(Fig. 4F). In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression
of HHIP and PTCH, 2 hedgehog target genes, was reduced in
NIH3T3 cocultured with Panc cells transfected with siHIF-1a
as compared with those transfected with siScr, suggesting
that GLI activation in ﬁbroblasts is dependent on expression
of HIF-1a in the tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).

To test whether activation of ﬁbroblasts was mediated by
SHH secreted from the tumor cells, we used siRNA to SHH.
Transfection of SHH-targeted siRNA into Panc-1 cells reduced
the level of SHH transcript by about 60% (as measured by RTPCR) and decreased their ability to induce GLI transactivation
in NIH-3T3/GLI-luc compared with transfection of a nontargeting siScr (Fig. 4F). Overexpression by transfection of Panc-1
cells with the cDNA for the hedgehog-interacting protein, HIP,
a regulatory component of the hedgehog signaling pathway
that localizes on the cell membrane (33) also inhibited GLI
activation in NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells (Fig. 4G). In addition,
expression of HHIP and PTCH was reduced in ﬁbroblasts
cocultured with Panc-1 cells overexpressing HHIP (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results conﬁrm that the SHH formed by
pancreatic cancer cells is involved in mediating hedgehog
activation in ﬁbroblasts.
HIF-1a–dependent expression of SHH by pancreatic
cancer cells induces a desmoplastic reaction in
ﬁbroblasts
Expression of SHH has been reported to contribute to the
formation of desmoplasia in pancreatic cancer (11). We therefore tested whether hypoxia and HIF-1a–induced formation of
SHH by pancreatic cancer cells can induce a desmoplastic
reaction in cultured ﬁbroblasts. We conducted immunoﬂuorescence analysis for the production of 2 extracellular matrix
proteins, ﬁbronectin and collagen I, both of which are wellcharacterized components of desmoplasia. There was minimal
to no immunoﬂuorescence staining of the tumor cells themselves (Fig. 5A). However, in cocultures of NIH-3T3 cells with
MiaPaca2 or Capan2 cells, immunostaining for both ﬁbronectin and collagen was stronger in hypoxia compared with
normoxia (Fig. 5B). The requirement for HIF-1a and SHH
expression by pancreatic cancer cells for the desmoplastic
reaction was shown by decreased ﬁbronectin and collagen I
staining in cocultures of NIH-3T3 cells with MiaPaca2 cells
stably transfected with shHIF-1a or siSHH, compared with
MiaPaca2 cells expressing shVector or siSCR, respectively (Fig.
5C and Supplementary Fig. S7).

A HIF-1a inhibitor, PX-478, inhibits hedgehog signaling
Inhibiting hedgehog signaling is an attractive approach to
therapy for cancers where hedgehog is aberrantly regulated.
Therefore, we investigated whether it is possible to block the
formation of hedgehog pathway components in the tumor cells
using the HIF inhibitor PX-478 (Fig. 6A; refs. 34, 35). Treatment
with PX-478 of Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells decreased the
transcript levels of SHH and PTCH in both normoxia and
hypoxia (Fig. 6B). In addition, PX-478 treatment of 3D cocultures
of NIH-3T3/GLI-luc cells with either Panc-1, Su.86.86, Capan-2,
or MiaPaca2, resulted in complete inhibition of GLI activation
(Fig. 6C). Furthermore, comparing the effects of PX-478 and the
SMO selective antagonist GDC-0449 in the 3D system revealed
that both HIF-1a and SHH drive hedgehog signaling in the
stroma (Fig. 6D). This provides a proof-of-concept that HIF

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most hypoxic solid tumors
and HIF-1a levels are elevated in human primary pancreatic
cancer as compared with normal pancreas (8, 35–37). Our
study describes a new mechanism that ties hypoxia with the
elevated expression of SHH and the desmoplasia commonly
seen in pancreatic cancer. We show that hypoxia, acting
through elevated HIF-1a, increases the expression of SHH in
pancreatic cancer cells and that patients with high expression
of HIF-1a and SHH show decreased survival. We also found
that in hypoxia the SHH produced by the tumor cells, acts in a

paracrine manner on ﬁbroblasts to increase desmoplasia. We
propose a new model of tumor–stroma interaction, whereby
multiple cycles of hypoxia, HIF-1a, hedgehog signaling, and
desmoplasia render pancreatic cancer more aggressive and
resistant to therapy.
IHC staining of human pancreatic tumors revealed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between hypoxia measured by
expression of HIF-1a and CAIX, a downstream target of HIF1a, in the tumor and expression of SHH in the stroma. Both
high HIF-1a and high SHH scores were associated with a
signiﬁcantly shorter patient survival, and the outcome of
combining these 2 markers (high HIF-1a and high SHH vs.
low HIF-1a and low SHH) was a highly signiﬁcant prediction
for decreased patient survival. No correlation was found with
other markers tested including PTCH, Ki-67, a proliferation
marker, vimentin, or SMA. The later 2 markers stained the
stroma indiscriminately. Our results conﬂict with a recent
report that high expression of SMA in the stroma correlates
with worse prognosis (38).

We showed that in pancreatic tumor cells hypoxia increased
the expression of SHH in a HIF-1a–dependent manner. Using a
hedgehog pathway–speciﬁc array, we conﬁrmed that SHH,
PTCH, and RENKCTD11 transcripts are modiﬁed in hypoxia.
Moreover, we identiﬁed the HRE core sequence (G/A)CGTG,
based on 108 core HREs found in 70 known HIF-1a target genes
(39) in the promoter regions (positions relative to transcriptional start) of SHH (759, 503), RENKCTD11 (491, 243, 186), and
PTCH1: (272, 916). Noteworthy, hypoxia has previously been
reported to increase SHH expression and induce a hedgehog
response in ischemic heart models (40–44).
Despite the fact that the NIH-3T3 ﬁbroblasts responded to
SHH by activating GLI, they themselves had low level of SHH
transcript and did not induce expression of SHH in hypoxia
even though they expressed active HIF-1a in hypoxia as
determined by HRE-luc reporter assays. At the moment, the
full mechanism underlying HIF-1a–induced expression of SHH
and PTCH in pancreatic cells but not in ﬁbroblasts is not fully
elucidated. However, we believe that the differential activation

of the hedgehog pathway observed is partly attributable to
the experimental settings, for example, 2D versus 3D. In 2D
monolayer cultures, cells are homogenously exposed to hypoxia, thus likely exhibit a homogenous response and a substantial transcriptional increase of hedgehog target genes
that can be easily detected in bulk experiments. In 3D coculture conditions, tumor cells and ﬁbroblasts form spheroids
in which cells are exposed to a gradient of hypoxia, thus
hedgehog activation might be patchy and exhibited only by
the hypoxic fraction of cells in the spheroid, therefore accounting for the modest increase of the luciferase activity and for
the lack of detectable transcriptional changes assessed by the
bulk qRT-PCR experiments.
Our ﬁnding that SHH acts in a paracrine fashion is in accord
with recent evidence showing that in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hedgehog ligands fail
to activate signaling in tumor epithelial cells but do activate
ﬁbroblasts in the stromal microenvironment (10–13, 19). Paracrine hedgehog signaling has been shown to support protu-

morigenic communication between tumor cells and ﬁbroblasts in the stroma and to promote tumor growth (16, 27).
Recent work suggests that pancreatic tumor cells are not
competent to transduce hedgehog signaling because they
express oncogenic KRAS. On the basis of these studies, KRAS
suppresses ciliogenesis and therefore pancreatic tumor cells
are devoid of primary cilia, which are required for hedgehog
signaling (10, 45, 46). In another study, it was suggested that
KRAS acts through dual-speciﬁcity tyrosine phosphorylation
regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1B) and potentially other factors to
block hedgehog activation (46).
Hedgehog signaling is known to induce ﬁbroblasts to produce extracellular proteins such as ﬁbronectin and collagen I
involved in desmoplasia (11). We showed that hypoxia via HIF1a increases the expression of SHH in the pancreatic cell lines,
thus activating the hedgehog pathway and desmoplasia in
ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 5). These results suggested that in pancreatic
cancer, hypoxia and HIF-1a increase desmoplasia by upregulating the formation of SHH by pancreatic cancer cells, which

Inhibiting hedgehog signaling is an attractive approach for
therapy for cancers where hedgehog is aberrantly regulated
and was shown to enhance delivery of chemotherapy in a
mouse model of pancreatic cancer (24). So far, only SMO
inhibitors have been tested in humans and have produced
promising antitumor responses in early clinical studies (47–
49). However, resistance to SMO inhibition has been shown to

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

rapidly occur in patients with medulloblastma due to mutations of SMO that do not affect hedgehog signaling but disrupt
the ability of the GDC-0449 inhibitor to bind SMO (50). An
alternative approach, and one that would not be susceptible to
this kind of resistance, is to inhibit the production of hedgehog
ligand by the tumor cell, for example by using a HIF-1a
inhibitor that will prevent the hypoxia-induced ﬁbrosis caused
by the response of ﬁbroblasts to SHH. Moreover, as induction
of SHH is only one of HIF's pleiotropic effects, this further

validates HIF as a promising target for cancer therapy. We have
shown that the HIF-1a inhibitor PX-478, can inhibit GLI
activation in ﬁbroblasts cocultured with pancreatic cancer
cells (Fig. 6), strengthening the notion that HIF-1a inhibitors
may be beneﬁcial for hypoxic and hedgehog ligand-dependent
tumors such as pancreatic and prostate cancers (32).
On the basis of our results, we propose the vicious cycle
model of pancreatic cancer (Fig. 6E) in which tumor hypoxia
leads to increased SHH and desmoplasia, which in turn
further reduces blood supply to the tumor thus further
augmenting tumor hypoxia. Repeating cycles of hypoxia and
desmoplasia may be responsible for the highly hypoxic and
ﬁbrotic characteristics of pancreatic cancer. Breaking the
cycle, for example with a HIF-1a inhibitor, provides an
alternative approach for treatment of hedgehog ligand-depen-
