ABSTRACT
Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones are an important ingredient of leukemia therapy
since they are potent inducers of lymphoid cell apoptosis. However, the development of
GC resistance remains an obstacle in GC-based treatment. In the present investigation
we found that miR-103 is upregulated in GC-sensitive leukemia cells treated by the
hormone. Transfection of GC resistant cells with miR-103 sensitized them to GC
induced apoptosis (GCIA), while miR-103 sponging of GC sensitive cells rendered
them partially resistant. miR-103 reduced the expression of cyclin dependent kinase
(CDK2) and its cyclin E1 target, thereby leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation.
miR-103 is encoded within the fifth intron of PANK3 gene. We demonstrate that
the GC receptor (GR) upregulates miR-103 by direct interaction with GC response
element (GRE) in the PANK3 enhancer. Consequently, miR-103 targets the c-Myc
activators c-Myb and DVL1, thereby reducing c-Myc expression. Since c-Myc is a
transcription factor of the miR-17~92a poly-cistron, all six miRNAs of the latter are
also downregulated. Of these, miR-18a and miR-20a are involved in GCIA, as they
target GR and BIM, respectively. Consequently, GR and BIM expression are elevated,
thus advancing GCIA. Altogether, this study highlights miR-103 as a useful prognostic
biomarker and drug for leukemia management in the future.

INTRODUCTION

seven days. About 75% of ALL patients respond well
to PRED treatment and are classified as PRED good
responders (PGRs). The remaining PRED resistant patients
are defined as PRED poor responders (PPRs) [1, 2]. While
PGR patients receive standard therapeutic regimen, PPR
patients are subjected to a high risk (HR) protocol. Since
the HR protocol implicates highly toxic side effects, it is
of great clinical interest to evaluate the real necessity of
such treatment. To this end, it is imperative to study the
molecular basis of GC-mediated therapy and the mode by
which cells resist PRED treatment, in order to improve the
therapeutic outcome.
In the absence of GC, the GC receptor (GR) is
sequestered in the cytosol by a heteromeric protein
complex [3]. Upon GC binding, the complex dissociates

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in the
therapy of lymphoma and leukemia due to their ability
to induce apoptosis and proliferation arrest of lymphoid
cells. Prednisone (PRED) and Dexamethasone (Dex),
both synthetic GC analogues, are major components in
the therapy of many immunological disorders, including
hematopoietic malignancies. Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by
replacement of normal hematopoietic cells in the bone
marrow by undifferentiated and highly proliferative
lymphoid precursors of T or B origin (referred as T-ALL
or B-ALL, respectively). Newly diagnosed ALL patients
are initially treated with PRED, as a sole medication, for

to enable GR activation and nuclear translocation [4]. In
the nucleus, GR modulates expression of multiple genes
by interaction with GC response elements (GRE) or by
trans-regulation of other transcription factors [5–7]. Most
of the GR regulated genes are unrelated to apoptosis [8].
Numerous studies were performed on the
biochemical events leading to acquisition of GC apoptotic
resistance. GR nuclear activities occur in both GCsensitive and GC-resistant cells. However, the gene
expression profile is distinguishable between such cells.
Several apoptosis related genes were found to be regulated
in GC-sensitive, but not resistant cells [8]. Of special note
are the upregulation of the GR [9] and BIM [10], and the
downregulation of c-Myc [11].
GR expression is auto-upregulated in GC-sensitive
cells following GC treatment [9]. This feedback is enabled
by a GRE located within the GR promoter [9, 12] and
acts to amplify the apoptotic response [13]. Indeed, GCresistant cells downregulate the GR upon GC treatment
[14]. However, many GC-resistant cells express high
basal levels of GR [15], indicating that GR expression
is not the sole factor required for GC-induced apoptosis
(GCIA), although a threshold GR level is mandatory to
initiate GCIA.
Besides GR, the most important gene upregulated
during GCIA is BIM [10]. BIM−/− thymocytes and BIM
knocked down lymphoma cells display resistance to GCIA
[16, 17]. Therefore, in most ALL cells, GC-induced BIM
upregulation is mandatory for advancing GCIA [18].
Indeed, ALL patients categorized into PGR subgroup
upregulate BIM expression after 7 days of PRED
monotherapy, while in ALL patients belonging to PPR
category BIM expression is downregulated or remains
unchanged. Hence, BIM is a good prognostic biomarker
for PRED response in ALL [19, 20].
Upon GC stimulation, c-Myc is downregulated
in GC-sensitive, but not in GC-resistant cells [11, 21].
In some B cell lymphomas c-Myc is deregulated as a
consequence of a cMyc/Ig chromosomal translocation
[22], while in many T-ALLs, c-Myc and its target genes
are directly upregulated by IC-NOTCH [23]. Hence, GCinduced c-Myc downregulation may offset the tumorigenic
phenotype of malignant lymphoid cells.
It has been discovered that GR regulates microRNA
expression in lymphoid cells [24–29]. For instance, GC
enhances apoptosis by modulating the expression of
miR-15~16 [24]. Indeed, overexpression of miR-15~16
in T-ALL increased GCIA while its silencing decreased
it [24]. In addition, GC downregulates the miR17~92a poly-cistron (containing six mi-RNA: miR-17,
miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92a)
[25, 26]. miR-17~92a is upregulated in T-ALL and
promotes leukemogenesis [30]. It was demonstrated that
GCs upregulate BIM expression through downregulation
of miR-17~92a [26]. Indeed, BIM is downregulated by
miR-17~92a [31], mostly by miR-17, miR-19 and miRwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

92a [30, 32, 33]. c-Myc, which is downregulated by GC, is
a transcription factor of miR-17~92a [34], and deletion of
miR-17~92a represses c-Myc-induced oncogenesis [35].
By using deep sequencing analysis to compare GCregulated miRNAs in GC-sensitive ALL cells, we found
that miR-103 stands out as the most significant miRNA
that is upregulated during GCIA. Furthermore, miR-103
overexpression confers sensitivity to GCIA on otherwise
GC-resistant cells. In the present study, we outline the mode
by which miR-103 is involved in GCIA and cell cycle arrest.
We suggest that miR-103 plays a pivotal role in GCIA and
that its upregulation sensitizes GC resistant cells to GCIA.

RESULTS
Glucocorticoid hormones in the treatment of
acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)
The clinical management of ALL widely relies on
GC-based regimen. Indeed, Figure 1A indicates that most
ALL patients (50% of remission in the case of T-ALL,
N = 43; 83% in the case of B-ALL, N = 20) are good
responders to Prednisone (PRED) treatment (PRED Good
Response, PGR; absolute blast count in peripheral blood
≤ 1000/µl after 7 days of PRED administration). However,
10% and 22% of PGR B-ALL and T-ALL patients,
respectively, relapse. In addition, half of T-ALL and
16.3% of B-ALL d patients are poor responders to PRED
treatment (PRED Poor Response, PPR; absolute blast
count in peripheral blood ≥ 1000/µl after 7 days of PRED
administration). The relapse rate of PPR ALL patients is
higher than PGR ALL patients with approximately 30%
to both B and T- ALL. Therefore, the PRED effect is one
of the most important prognostic markers according to
AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 protocol [1, 2]. Consequently,
after 7-days of PRED treatment, PPR patients are
reassigned to high-risk protocols including aggressive
chemotherapies and/or BM-transplantation. Hence, the
effectiveness of GC treatment in ALL is limited, since
some patients are less responsive to GC-based therapy,
and others acquire resistance along the treatment.
Furthermore, PGR ALL patients relapse, albeit with a
lower rate, indicating that prognosis is estimated with
insufficient accuracy and that applying high risk regimen
might well avoid relapse in some patients. Therefore, it is
of a major interest to get a profound understanding of the
mechanisms involved in GC-induced apoptosis (GCIA).
We analyzed the effect of Dex on apoptosis of the
GC-sensitive CEM-C7H2 cell. Flow cytometry analysis,
showed that Dex induces apoptosis in 51.3% of the
cells as determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining,
or 69.2 ± 9.6% based on the percent of the sub-diploid
Caspase-3-positive cells (Figure 1B). Additionally, BrdU
incorporation analysis indicates that CEM-C7H2 cells
display a significant decrease in their proliferation rate
following Dex treatment (Figure 1C). To gain an insight

miR-103 inhibits cellular proliferation

into the molecular pathways regulating GCIA and GCinduced proliferation inhibition, CEM-C7H2 cells treated
with Dex or untreated, were subjected to deep sequencing
of small RNAs (Supplementary Table S1). This analysis
revealed eleven miRNAs that were most significantly
regulated by Dex in the sensitive CEM-C7H2 cells
(Figure 1D). None of these miRNAs were significantly
modulated in Dex-treated GC-resistant MOLT-4 cells
(Supplementary Table S2). As miR-103 stood out as the
most significant Dex- modulated miRNA, we decided
to focus on its involvement in both proliferation and
apoptosis. miR-103 real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
of Dex-treated CEM-C7H2 (Figure 1E) validated the
deep sequencing data (Figure 1D), marking miR-103 as
significantly modulated upon GC-treatment.

We compared the basal expression of miR-103 in
leukemia patients and healthy counterparts. To this end,
the level of miR-103 was determined in bone marrowderived mononuclear cells (MCs) from healthy donors
and ALL patients. We observed that the miR-103 level is
significantly downregulated in ALL MCs compared with
normal bone marrow-derived MCs (Figure 2A). Since
tumorigenesis is associated with high proliferative state
of the cancer cells, we asked whether miR-103 decrease
in ALL MCs can be related to cellular proliferation. To
answer this question, we analyzed miR-103 expression in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal
donors (ND) stained with CFSE and stimulated with

anti- CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 4 days. Figure 2B
shows that CFSE dilution (i.e., > 90% proliferative T cells,
data not shown) is associated with a decrease in miR-103
level. To confirm that inhibition of cellular proliferation
is miR-103-dependent, CUTLL, MOLT-4, SUD-H6 and
BJAB cells were either infected with miR-103 or miRCNT (CNT) vectors (Figure 2C) and further assessed
for BrdU incorporation by an ELISA assay. Figure 2C
shows that miR-103 expression in miR-103-transfected
cell lines induces a significant reduction in their
proliferative rate. Interestingly, analysis of the basal level
of miR-103 in different human organs reveals that there
is an inverse correlation between the level of miR-103
and the proliferative state of the organ (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Again, this observation supports the concept
that miR-103 is associated with cellular proliferation.
Indeed, it has been reported that GC also induces cell cycle
arrest (Figure 1C) [36, 37]. Along this line, we found that

miR-103 also reduced the total cell number in the culture,
which was further decreased by Dex but abolished when
GR was inhibited by RU486 (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Screening of the literature points out at cyclin E1 and its
positive regulator CDK2, as essential for the G1 -> S
transition. These proteins are direct targets of miR-103
[38], and were found to be downregulated by miR-103
overexpression in our study as well (Figure 2D and
Supplementary Figure S1C–S1E). Vice versa, when
miR-103 is sponged (with sponge vector described in
Supplementary Figure S1F), there is a marked induction
of both cyclin E1 and CDK2 expression (Figure 2D).

miR-103 regulation upon Dex stimulation
miR-103 resides within the fifth intron of the PANK3
gene (Supplementary Figure S1G) [39]. In order to
investigate whether miR-103 and PANK3 are co-regulated,

according to the miR-CNT values obtained in each corresponding cell line. (D) miR-103 overexpressing BJAB cells or sponged-miR-103

we first analyzed the relative quantification (RQ) of these
two genes in untreated or Dex-treated cells. As shown
in Figure 3A–3B, there is no correlation between basal
miR-103 and PANK3 levels. However, following Dex
treatment, miR-103 and PANK3 were both upregulated
in CEM-C7H2 but remained unchanged in other cells
(Figure 3A and 3B). Moreover, inhibition of GR by its
inhibitor RU486, blocked both miR-103 and PANK3
upregulation (Supplementary Figure S1H).
In analyzing the PANK3 promoter, we detected a
GRE sequence ~10,000 bp upstream to its coding region.
This domain (TGTGCAAACTATTCTT) is located at
chr5:168017288-168017303 and is compatible with
a consensus GRE [5, 6]. We have therefore applied
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay on CEMC7H2 cells untreated or treated with Dex. Using an
anti-GR antibody, we found that the PANK3-GRE was
enriched by approximately 5% in Dex-treated compared
with untreated cells (Figure 3C), indicating that upon
activation, GR binds to GRE within the PANK3 promoter.
Furthermore, PANK3-GRE immunoprecipitated by antiH3K4me1 was enriched nearly fivefold in Dex-treated
cells (Figure 3C), suggesting that PANK3-GRE is an
enhancer. No Dex-induced PANK3-GRE enrichment
by control IgG antibody was observed (Figure 3C). As
a positive control we used two bona fide GRE domains
of the GR promoter [12]. Indeed, GR IP in Dex-treated
cells was followed by enrichment of GR-GRE while the
negative control MYOD1 was not enriched (Figure 3C).

miR-103 overexpression or sponge vectors (e.g., following
ultra-centrifuge process). In some untreated cells, miR103 overexpression had only a minor effect on apoptosis.
However, when treated with Dex, resistant BJAB,
MOLT-4, CUTLL, and SUD-H6 cells overexpressing
miR-103 underwent significant apoptosis (Figure 3F and
Supplementary Figure S2A–S2C). Moreover, sensitive
CEM-C7H2, DAUDI and LOUCY cells overexpressing
miR-103 became hyper-sensitive to GCIA (Figure 3G
and Supplementary Figure S2D–S2E). Vice versa, when
miR-103 was sponged in CEM-C7H2, LOUCY and
DAUDI, a slight reduction in apoptosis was observed
following treatment with Dex (Figure 3G and
Supplementary Figure  S2A–S2B). These data indicate
that miR-103 plays a pivotal role in GCIA. The partial
reduction in GCIA following miR-103 sponging can be
attributed to potential redundant pathways with overlapping
GCIA-related functions. This observation indicates that
miR-103 may act as a tumor suppressor by both inhibiting
cellular proliferation (Figure 2) and conferring sensitivity
to GCIA (Figure 3).
To clarify the mode of action of miR-103, we
analyzed its effect on consensus GC-affected proteins. To
this end, we enumerated the expression of GR, BIM and
c-Myc proteins upon Dex exposure. Western blot analysis
(Figure 3H) confirmed that GR and BIM are upregulated
in Dex-treated CEM-C7H2 GC-sensitive cell line, whereas
c-Myc is downregulated.

miR-103 downregulates c-Myc expression

miR-103 confers GCIA

c-Myc, which is downregulated by GC in sensitive
CEM-C7H2 and LOUCY (Supplementary Figure S3A)
cells transfected with the miR-CNT vector but to a much
lower extent in resistant BJAB (Figure 4A), CUTLL,
SUD-H6, and MOLT-4 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3A), was reduced by miR-103 overexpression. c-Myc
was further downregulated following Dex treatment
(Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3A). Moreover,
sponging miR-103 in CEM-C7H2 cells, upregulated
c-Myc expression (Figure 4A). However, upon Dex
treatment, c-Myc expression was nullified (Figure 4A),
explaining why GCIA of miR-103 sponged cells was only
decreased but not abolished (Figure 3G). It seems that
Dex treatment upregulates miR-103 to levels excessive of
the sponge absorption capacity. In order to demonstrate
the impact of c-Myc ablation on GCIA, BJAB cells were
transfected with sh-RNA of c-Myc. This manipulation
imitates the effect of miR-103 overexpression on GCIA
(Figure 4B).

To evaluate the effect of miR-103 on GCIA, we
assessed GC-sensitive and GC-resistant cell lines for
apoptosis. To this end, CEM-C7H2, LOUCY, DAUDI,
BJAB, MOLT-4, CUTLL, and SUD-H6 cell lines were
treated with Dex for 72 hours. CEM-C7H2, LOUCY
and DAUDI cells responded with apoptosis, while
BJAB, MOLT-4, CUTLL, and SUD-H6 remained alive
(Figure  3D). BJAB cells exhibit the lower percent of
apoptosis upon Dex treatment (Figure 3D), and also display
the lowest level of miR-103 expression (Figure 3A). For
this reason, we chose to focus on BJAB cells for further
analysis. To confirm that miR-103 plays an essential
role in GCIA and is a Dex-regulated, we constructed
overexpression and sponge plasmids (Supplementary
Figure S1F) of the first sixteen Dex-regulated miRNAs in
CEM-C7H2 (Supplementary Table S1) and searched for
additional miRNAs that impose a GC-sensitive phenotype
on otherwise GC-resistant cells. Indeed, transfection with
miR-103 was particularly effective in conferring GCsensitivity upon BJAB cells (Figure 3E). This parallels the
outcome of the deep sequencing data, marking miR-103
as most significantly modulated upon Dex-stimulation
(Figure 1D). Consequently, we tested the effect of miR103 on GCIA by transfection with more concentrated

is known to activate β-Catenin, which similarly to c-Myb,
acts as a transcription factor of c-Myc [40, 41]. Figure

3ʹUTRs of DVL1 and c-Myb, To investigate whether miR-

103 directly targets both c-Myb and DVL1, we mutated
three nucleotides in the predicted binding sites of miR-103
(Figure 4C), cloned both the mutated and wild type
3ʹUTR of DVL1 and c-Myb, respectively, downstream
to a luciferase reporter gene, and assessed the luciferase
activity in the presence of miR-103. To this end, miR- CNT

miR-17~92a

or miR-103 overexpressing 293T cells (Figure 4D) were
co-transfected with Firefly luciferase reporter PGL3
vector containing either the native 3ʹUTR of c-Myb and
DVL1, or the mutated 3ʹUTR (as described in Figure 4C),
together with a control Renilla luciferase pRL-CMV
vector. Firefly luciferase activity was measured two days
post-transfection and normalized to the activity of the
control Renilla reporter. Figure 4E–4F indicates that miR103 overexpression significantly decreases Firefly activity
in 293T transfected with the wild type 3ʹUTRs of c-Myb
and DVL1, respectively. Mutation in the seed sequence of
c-Myb partially restored the luciferase activity (Figure 4E)
while the mutated 3ʹUTR of DVL1 failed to do so
(Figure 4F). Together, these findings indicate that miR103 effectively targets the 3ʹUTRs of c-Myb and DVL1,
respectively. The mutation in the DVL1 seed sequence
was not efficient enough to restore luciferase activity.
Alternatively, it may be possible that the mutation in the
seed region generated a new sequence which effectively
binds to unspecific miRNAs.
c-Myb is highly expressed in CEM-C7H2, LOUCY,
CUTLL and MOLT-4 cells (Supplementary Figure S3B),
but undergoes significant downregulation by Dex only in
CEM-C7H2 and LOUCY sensitive cells (Supplementary
Figure S3D). Note that c-Myb expression was not detected
in BJAB and SUD-H6 resistant cell lines (Figure 4G
and Supplementary Figure S3B). DVL1 is expressed in
CEM-C7H2, LOUCY, BJAB, and SUD-H6 cells but is
almost inexistent in CUTLL and MOLT-4. Following Dex
exposure, both DVL1 and β-Catenin were downregulated
in the sensitive CEM-C7H2 and LOUCY miR-CNT
cells, but barely affected in the resistant cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S3B).
We measured the level of these proteins in miR103 overexpressing vis-a-vis sponged cells and found that
both DVL1 and β-Catenin were downregulated by miR103 in BJAB, SUD-H6 and LOUCY (in BJAB, β-Catenin
is downregulated by miR-103 only with additional Dex
treatment), and upregulated when the level of miR-103
was reduced by its sponge (Figure 4G and Supplementary
Figure S3B). However, DVL1 was not detected in MOLT4 and CUTLL and its expression in CEM-C7H2 was
even upregulated when miR-103 was overexpressed
(Supplementary Figure S3B). Likewise, the level of
β-Catenin was unaffected by miR-103 in CEM-C7H2 and
even upregulated in MOLT4 (Supplementary Figure S3B).
By contrast, miR-103 downregulates c-Myb expression in
CEM-C7H2, LOUCY, CUTLL and MOLT-4 T-ALL cells
(Figure 4G and Supplementary Figure S3B). Moreover,
upon miR-103 sponging, c-Myb expression is significantly
increased (Figure 4G). However, c-Myb upregulation by
miR-103 sponge is almost eliminated upon Dex induction
(Figure 4G), explaining the low effect of miR-103 sponge
on GCIA. We failed to detect c-Myb in B cell lymphomas,
as this protein plays an essential role mostly in T, but less
in B cell development (Supplementary Figure S3B) [42].

c-Myc is a transcription factor of the oncogenic
miR-17~92a multi-cistron [34]. Indeed, in CEM-C7H2
cells, which responded to GC with downregulation of
c-Myc (Figure 3H), miR-17~92a was also downregulated
following Dex treatment (Figure 5A) [25, 26]. However,
in GC-resistant cells, both miR-17~92a and c-Myc were
almost unaffected by Dex (Data not shown). When
miR-103 was overexpressed in GC-resistant BJAB
cells, a reduced expression of miR-17~92a was recorded
(Figure  5B). To verify whether the downregulation of
miR-17~92a is involved in miR-103 mediated GCIA,
we transfected BJAB cells overexpressing miR-103
with plasmids containing each miRNA of miR-17~92a.
Only miR-18a and miR-20a re-expression counteracted
the miR-103-mediated GCIA (Figure 5C–5D and
Supplementary Figure S3C–S3F).

Suppression of miR-18a by miR-103 enables GR
upregulation
In order to decipher the mode by which miR103-induced downregulation of miR-18a and miR-20a
facilitates GCIA, we searched for target genes of the
aforementioned miRs. Computational analysis (miRanda
software) revealed that miR-18a possesses a 8mer base pair
sequence compatible with the 3ʹUTR region of GR mRNA
(NR3C1) (Figure 6A). To demonstrate that miR-18a
indeed targets the 3ʹUTR of GR, we performed a luciferase
assay. To this end, miR-18a overexpressing 293T cells
(Figure 6B) were transfected with either the wild type or
seed mutated 3ʹUTR of GR (Figure 6A). Luciferase activity
was significantly reduced in the presence of miR-18a,
while in the presence of the mutated 3ʹUTR of GR
luciferase activity was restored, confirming that miR-18a
directly targets the 3ʹUTR of GR (Figure 6C).
It was previously reported that GR is upregulated
in GC-sensitive cells but downregulated in GC-resistant
cells upon GC-treatment [15]. However, we found
that GR is indeed upregulated by Dex treatment in
GC-sensitive CEM-C7H2 but downregulated in GCsensitive LOUCY and DAUDI and in all GC-resistant
cells tested (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure S4C).
At the mRNA level, GR is upregulated only in the GCsensitive CEM-C7H2 cells but remains unchanged in the
rest GC-sensitive and GC-resistant cells (Supplementary
Figure S4B). These results suggest that GR expression
is regulated post-transcriptionally. Dex-induced GR
mRNA upregulation in CEM-C7H2 correlates with miR18a downregulation (Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B),
whereas when GR level was unaffected by Dex,
the level of miR-18a also remained unchanged
(Supplementary Figure S4A–S4B), thus suggesting
that miR-18a controls the stability of GR mRNA.

miR-103 overexpression elicits both GR protein and
mRNA upregulation (Figure 6E and Supplementary
Figure S4C–S4D). Furthermore, sponging of miR-103
in CEM-C7H2 cells reduced the Dex-induced GR
upregulation (Figure  6E), suggesting that GR is autoupregulated, in part, by miR-103 upregulation. In contrast
to GR mRNA, which was augmented following Dex

treatment in miR-103 overexpressing cells (Supplementary
Figure S4D), GR protein level was reversed by Dex
treatment in both GC-resistant and GC-sensitive LOUCY
and DAUDI cells (Figure 6E and Supplementary
Figure  S4C). However, although GR is eventually
downregulated by Dex, in miR-103 overexpressing cells,
still its level is mostly higher than miR-CNT cells treated

with Dex. In addition, its basal level is the critical factor in
advancing GCIA, since GCIA is still detectable (Figure 3F
and Supplementary Figure S2A–S2E).
To reinforce the surmise that miR-103
downregulates miR-18a and upregulates GR by decreasing
the level of c-Myc, we overexpressed c-Myc in miR-103
transfected cells. Indeed, c-Myc overexpression reversed
the effect of miR-103 on miR-18a and GR expression
(Supplementary Figure S4E–S4F). In order to confirm that
miR-103-induced upregulation of GR is prompted by miR18a downregulation, we restored miR-18a expression in
miR-103 transfected cells. This manipulation blocked the
upregulation of GR mediated by miR-103 (Figure 6F). The
data suggest that GCIA induced by miR-103 is mediated,
in part, by downregulation of c-Myc, which is followed
by miR-18a downregulation and GR upregulation.
Indeed, inhibition of GR by RU486 prevented GCIA in
GC-sensitive CEM-C7H2 or in GC-resistant BJAB cells
sensitized by transfection with miR-103 (Figure 6D).

(Figure 5C). We have therefore searched for potential targets
of miR-20a that are involved in GCIA. We found (using
miRanda software) that miR-20a contains two conserved
sites compatible with the 3ʹUTR of BIM mRNA (Figure 7A).
Luciferase assay of miR-20a overexpressing 293T cells
(Figure 7B) transfected either with the predicted wild type
or seed mutated 3ʹUTRs of BIM, confirms that miR-20a
effectively targets the 3ʹUTRs of BIM, as indicated by the
reduction in luciferase activity (Figure 7C). Partial restoration
of luciferase activity in the presence of the mutated 3ʹUTRs
of BIM further supports this finding (Figure 7C).
Indeed, BIM and miR-20a are reciprocally regulated
in GC-sensitive CEM-C7H2 cells: while BIM mRNA
expression is upregulated by Dex (Supplementary Figure
S5B) [10], miR-20a is concomitantly downregulated
(Supplementary Figure S5A). Interestingly, although
miR-20a did not significantly change in both GCresistant and GC-sensitive LOUCY and DAUDI cells
(Supplementary Figure S5A), BIM was still upregulated
significantly in the GC-sensitive LOUCY and DAUDI
cells (Supplementary Figure S5B), suggesting that Dex
induces BIM upregulation in these cells by a miR-103independent mechanism. Indeed, although LOUCY
and DAUDI are sensitive to GCIA, miR-103 is not
upregulated by Dex in these cells, as in CEM-C7H2.

Suppression of miR-20a by miR-103 enables
BIM upregulation
Another function of miR-103 is to downregulate
miR-20a (Figure 5B) which partakes in advancing GCIA

To establish a link between miR-103-induced
miR-20a downregulation and BIM upregulation, we
first looked for the effect of miR-103 overexpression on
BIM. Indeed, miR-103 induced BIM upregulation both
at the protein and mRNA levels, an activity that was
augmented by Dex (Figure 7D and Supplementary Figure
S5C–S5D). Furthermore, sponging miR-103 in CEMC7H2 significantly reduced both basal and Dex-induced
BIM levels (Figure 7D). The role of BIM upregulation
in miR-103 mediated GCIA was verified with sh-RNA
studies. Downregulating BIM expression abrogates miR103 sensitization to GCIA (Figure 7E). Indeed, Sh-BIM

reduced BIM expression to its basal level as in nonmiR-103 transfected cells (Figure 7F panel A).
In order to establish that miR-103 upregulates
BIM expression by decreasing the level of c-Myc, we
overexpressed c-Myc in miR-103 transfected cells
and observed reversal of the miR-103 effect on BIM
expression (Supplementary Figure S5E). Finally, we
demonstrated that miR-103-induced BIM upregulation is
effectuated via the downregulation of miR-20a. While the
level of BIM is upregulated upon miR-103 transfection,
it is re-suppressed when miR-20a expression is restored
(Figure 7F panel B).

DISCUSSION

apoptosis are the hallmarks of effective GC-based therapy.
Therefore, we focused our investigation on the molecular
pathway by which miR-103 affects proliferation and
apoptosis in response to GC.
miR-103 is encoded within the intron of the
PANK3 gene [39]. PANK3 catalyzes phosphorylation of
Pantothenate [43], which is a crucial step in the synthesis
of Co-enzyme A [44] and activation of multiple metabolic
enzymes, none of which is involved in proliferation and

The present study unveils the molecular basis
underlying GC-sensitivity in leukemic cells. Deep
sequencing analysis points toward miR-103 as a potent
effector in this molecular machinery. While miR-103 plays
an essential role in some GC-sensitive cells, its ectopic
expression in GC-resistant cells confers a GC-sensitive
phenotype. Both inhibition of cellular proliferation and

apoptosis  [45]. It is therefore unlikely that miR-103
expression is solely controlled by transcription factors
of PANK3. Indeed, about 30% of intronic miRNAs
are transcribed independently of their host gene [46].
Our study indicates a miscorrelation between the basal
expression levels of PANK3 and miR-103. Nevertheless,
upon GC stimulation, miR-103 and PANK3 are coregulated. We discovered that the PANK3 promoter
is activated by GR due to a GRE which we detected
~10,000 bp upstream to its coding region. Presumably,
the GRE within the PANK3 locus acts as an enhancer that
upregulates miR-103 expression by nuclear GR.
miR-103 has controversial role in cancer
development. On the one hand, miR-103 functions as a
tumor suppressor. For example, it is downregulated in
prostate cancer and by that virtue enables upregulation
of its oncogenic target PDCD10, which promotes
proliferation and cellular migration [47]. Furthermore,
miR-103 reduces the proliferation of neuroblastoma
cells and promotes their differentiation [48]. In addition,
miR-103 suppresses proliferation of non-malignant cells
as osteoblasts [49] and mouse intestinal crypt cells [38].
Indeed, IGF-1 stimulation of mouse intestinal crypt cells
is accompanied by the downregulation of miR-103, which
is followed by upregulation of its target genes: CCNE1,
CDK2 and CREB1 [38]. On the other hand, miR-103
functions as an oncogene in some other cancerous cells.
For example, it promotes cellular proliferation and
inhibits apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [50].
Furthermore, miR-103 is upregulated in colorectal cancer
(serves as a marker for poor prognosis) and promotes
tumor cell proliferation, migration and metastasis.
In addition, miR-103 inhibits apoptosis, partially by
targeting DICER and PTEN (in relation to proliferation
and migration) [51], by targeting PER3 (in relation
to apoptosis) [52] and by targeting DAPK and KLF4
(in relation to metastasis) [53]. miR-103 also targets
metalloproteinase 3 and mediates endometrial cancer cells
growth and invasion [54]. The debatable role of miR-103
in various cancer types points to tissues specific effect.
We found that miR-103 expression is lower in bone
marrow-derived MCs of ALL patients than in healthy
bone marrow. Therefore, we suggest that miR-103
downregulation might be essential for ALL development
and acts as a tumor suppressor. Indeed, proliferation
induction of normal PBMCs, which was accompanied
by miR-103 downregulation, confirms this concept. GCs
are known to reduce proliferation of many cell types
[36, 55–57]. This effect has been attributed, in part, to a
decreased activity of CDK2 and CDK4, decreased levels
of cyclin D, E2F and c-Myc, and increased levels of the
CDK inhibitor p21Cip1 [57]. These data are corroborated by
our findings that Dex significantly reduces proliferation
of GC-sensitive cells while in GC-resistant cells,
miR-103 overexpression imitates the GC effect. This
observation suggests that the GC-mediated inhibition of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular proliferation is followed, in part, by miR-103
upregulation. Remarkably, miR-103 inhibits CDK2 and
cyclin E1 in ALL and Burkitt’s lymphoma cells as in the
mouse intestinal crypt [38].
Screening in prediction software failed to detect
proteins belonging to the apoptotic signal of GC as direct
targets of miR-103. However, we found that c-Myc, which
is essential for GCIA [21], is a central player in miR-103mediated GCIA. c-Myc is an onco-protein deregulated in
a wide-range of tumors [58]. Genomic rearrangements
associated with c-Myc correlate with poor prognosis
in diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients undergoing
R-CHOP chemotherapy [59]. Hence, c-Myc upregulation
may be a cause for GC-resistance, thus proposing that
its downregulation by miR-103 is an essential step in
advancing GCIA. While c-Myc is not a target of miR-103,
we identified two c-Myc activators, c-Myb and DVL1,
as direct miR-103 targets. c-Myb is a leucine zipper
transcription factor essential for hematopoiesis, especially
of the T-cell lineage [42]. Its expression in T-ALL and
AML is sometimes affected by chromosomal aberrations
and amplifications [60]. c-Myb directly mediates c-Myc
transcription by virtue of its binding to the c-Myc promoter
[61]. Also, DVL1, whose triggering occurs via the Wnt
signaling pathway [62], activates c-Myc indirectly by
stabilizing β-Catenin [63], which acts as c-Myc transcription
factor [40]. In T-ALL, both c-Myb and β-Catenin are
activated. By contrast, in Burkitt’s lymphoma, c-Myb is
poorly expressed and therefore miR-103 effectuates c-Myc
downregulation via targeting of DVL1.	
Among the many genes affected by c-Myc is miR17~92a [34], which is upregulated in many human cancers
[64]. In analyzing the function of each miR-17~92a
member we observed that even thought all six miRNAs are
downregulated by miR-103, only miR-18a and miR-20a
affect GCIA. Indeed, we demonstrated that upregulation
of GR by miR-103 is induced via downregulation of both
c-Myc and miR-18a, whereas BIM upregulation is induced
via the downregulation of both c-Myc and miR-20a.
GR expression level is auto-upregulated in most
of the GC-sensitive cells as it binds to its own promoter
[12]. However, when miR-103 is sponged, GR is still autoupregulated but to a lower extent. Hence, GR upregulation
by GC proceeds along two different pathways: 1) GR
binding to its GRE, 2) GR induced miR-103 upregulation,
which is followed by c-Myc and miR-18a downregulation
that leads to GR mRNA stabilization. When GC-resistant
cells are treated by the hormone, GR is not upregulated
and even downregulated as a consequence of proteasomal
degradation [65, 66]. Upregulation of miR-103 in such
cells increases GR expression but does not protect it from
GC-induced degradation by the proteasome. Albeit the
marked reduction in GR expression, miR-103 still activates
GCIA, thus suggesting that a basal level of the GR is
sufficient to enable a GC-mediated apoptotic response. GR
phosphorylation after GC binding is an additional level of

GR regulation. Indeed, our preliminary data suggest that
miR-103 affects GR phosphorylation on both activatory
and inhibitory phosphorylation sites (data not shown).
It is therefore difficult to assess the consequences of
miR-103-mediated GR phosphorylation, its effect on GR
functionality and its subsequent contribution to GCIA.
Wang et al. [10] demonstrated that BIM is
upregulated by GC and its ablation abrogates GCIA.
However, BIM promoter does not contain GRE, suggesting
an indirect mechanism for its upregulation. Indeed, it was
previously demonstrated that miR-17~92a downregulates
BIM expression, but only miR-92a, miR-19 and miR-17
were shown to be involved in this outcome [30, 32, 33]. In
our hands, miR-20a downregulation by GC is responsible
for both BIM upregulation and GCIA while other members
of miR-17~92a do not affect BIM expression.

Based on the data presented herein, we propose
a model depicted in Figure 8. c-Myc deregulation in
leukemic cells upregulates miR-20a and miR-18a, which
are potential inhibitors of GCIA. Upon GC treatment,
miR-103 is activated in some GC-sensitive cells and
targets c-Myb and/or DVL1. Consequently, c-Myc is
downregulated, thus blocking miR-20a and miR-18a.
This outcome enables BIM expression and GR autoupregulation with eventual activation of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Since CDK2 and cyclin E1 induce
cellular proliferation, their inhibition by miR-103 is
also instrumental in blocking cell division. This model
does not imply that miR-103 upregulation is mandatory
for GCIA since there are alternative mechanisms by
which BIM expression is upregulated and initiates the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. However, conferring

Figure 8: A model of miR-103 network in GCIA. GC upregulates miR-103 expression by direct binding of activated GR to

a GRE sequence in the promoter of its host gene PANK3. miR-103 inhibits CDK2 and Cyclin E1 translation thus reducing cellular
proliferation. In addition, miR-103 inhibits c-Myb and/or DVL1 by binding to their 3ʹUTR. c-Myb downregulation results with c-Myc
transcription inhibition, whereas DVL1 downregulation results with β-Catenin degradation and transcription inhibition of c-Myc. c-Myc
ablation is followed by downregulation of miR-18a and miR-20a. As miR-18a inhibits GR translation, expression of GR is upregulated.
GR accumulation accelerates the response to GC and further elevates miR-103 in a positive feedback pathway. miR-20a inhibits BIM
translation and, therefore, miR-103-induced miR-20a downregulation is followed by BIM upregulation. Pro-apoptotic BIM activates the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by it inhibitory interaction with Bcl-2 proteins, which is followed by BAK and BAK oligomerization,
release of cytochrom C and SMAC/Diablo, thus leading to GCIA [72].
