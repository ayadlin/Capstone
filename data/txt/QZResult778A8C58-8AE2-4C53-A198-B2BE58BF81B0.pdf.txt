BACKGROUND: Priming with granulocytic hematopoietic growth factors may modulate cell cycle kinetics of leukemic
cells and render them more susceptible to phase-specific chemotherapeutic agents. In a first report, we have shown
that priming with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may enhance complete remission
(CR) rate and event-free survival (EFS) in younger adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: In this
randomized trial, 259 patients with AML were randomized at baseline to receive or not receive GM-CSF concurrently
with all cycles of chemotherapy. The effects of GM-CSF on survival were reported herein with a long-term follow-up
and studied according to distinct biological subgroups defined on cytogenetics and molecular markers. RESULTS:
The EFS rate was better in the GM-CSF group (43% vs 34%; P ¼.04). GM-CSF did not improve the outcome in
patients from good risk subgroups, while patients from poor risk subgroups benefited from GM-CSF therapy. In this
population, the difference in terms of EFS probability was mainly observed in patients with high initial white blood
cell count and in those with FLT3-ITD or MLL rearrangement. When combining these 2 molecular abnormalities for
comparison of the effect of GM-CSF priming, the difference in terms of EFS was highly significant (5-year EFS, 39%
with GM-CSF vs 8% without GM-CSF; P ¼.007). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization of leukemic cells and their progenitors
by GM-CSF appears as a plausible strategy for improving the outcome of patients with newly diagnosed AML.

Priming with granulocytic hematopoietic growth factors may modulate cell cycle kinetics of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) blasts and render them more susceptible to phase-specific agents such as cytarabine. In vitro, the simultaneous exposure
of leukemic cells to chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factors increases the susceptibility of the cells to killing by chemotherapy, especially by the cell-cycle-specific agent cytarabine.1-3 We first conducted a randomized double-blind study of the
administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in association with induction timed-sequential
chemotherapy (TSC) in relapsing AML patients that showed a time to progression that tended to be longer in the GM-CSF
group.4 In the present Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA)-9802 trial, newly diagnosed AML patients were

randomized at baseline to receive or not GM-CSF during
TSC induction and each consolidation chemotherapy cycles.
First published results were encouraging showing that priming of leukemic cells with GM-CSF is a means of enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in younger adults with
AML.5 The effects of GM-CSF on event-free survival (EFS)
are reported herein with a long-term follow-up and according to distinct biological subgroups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatments
A total of 259 patients aged 15-50 years with untreated de
novo AML are included in the present GM-CSF study.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of Lyon
B-Hotel Dieu Hospital (n 99017B). Informed consent
was obtained from each patient in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Treatment modalities have already been detailed.5 After receiving a timed-sequential
induction therapy, complete remitters without allogeneic
stem cell transplantation indication and related donor
were randomized between the TSC ALFA-9000 consolidation6 or 4 courses of high-dose cytarabine, according to
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) schedule.7
All patients registered on the study were randomized at
registration to receive recombinant human GM-CSF
(Leucomax, Schering Plough) given at a dose of 5 lg/kg/
day intravenously over 6 hours, from Day 1 through the
last day of chemotherapy of each course (except salvage)
of chemotherapy or no GM-CSF.
Cytogenetics, Mutations Detection,
and Risk Classification
Karyotypes were classified into 3 categories (favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable) according to the Medical
Research Council (MRC) classification.8 The nucleophosmin mutations (NPM1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein-a mutations (CEBPA), fms-like tyrosine kinase-3
internal duplications (FLT3-ITD) and mutations
(FLT3m), mixed-lineage leukemia gene partial tandem
duplications (MLL/PTD), and Wilms tumor gene (WT1)
mutations were detected as previously described.9-13 Intermediate-risk cytogenetics was further subdivided into a
good risk-2 group (normal karyotypes with NPM1 or
CEBPA mutation and no FLT3-ITD) and a poor risk-2
group (other patients).
Definition of Clinical Endpoints
CR was defined as a normocellular bone marrow containing less than 5% blasts and showing evidence of normal

1726

maturation of other marrow elements, and the disappearance of all clinical signs of leukemia;14 95% of cases
defined as CR achieved a neutrophil count of 1  109/l
and a platelet count of 100  109/l. Remission failure
comprised resistant disease and induction death. EFS was
calculated from the date of first randomization, with CR
achievement failures, deaths during induction or in first
CR, and relapses included as events. Overall survival (OS)
was the time from first random assignment to death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined from date of CR to
date of first relapse or death, or last contact with patient in
continuous CR.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics and CR rates comparisons were
performed using the Pearson v2 test for binary variables
and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.
DFS, EFS, and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared using the log-rank test. Statistical
analyses were performed according to an intent-to-treat
basis. Survival comparisons were adjusted for covariates
using the Cox model and tested by the likelihood ratio
test. Simultaneous effects of multiple covariates were estimated with the maximum-likelihood logistic regression
model for response to therapy and with the Cox model for
EFS, DFS, and OS and tested by the likelihood-ratio test,
also used in univariate analyses for continuous variables.
Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) are reported as relative risks
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All computations were performed using BMDP software (BMDP Statistical Software, Los Angeles, Calif, USA).

RESULTS
General outcome
In this multicenter randomized trial, 124 patients were initially randomized in the GM-CSF arm and 135 in the no
GM-CSF arm. The main biological and clinical features of
the 259 patients are presented in Table 1. First results
show that priming of leukemia cells with GM-CSF may
enhance CR rate and EFS have been previously published.5
With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the 5-year
EFS rate was confirmed to be better in patients primed
with GM-CSF (43% vs 34%; P ¼ .04) (Fig. 1), while the
difference remained not significant in terms of OS (49%
vs 42%; P ¼ .21).

Priming did not improve the outcome in patients
with CBF leukemias (5-year EFS at 61% with priming vs
62% without priming; P ¼ .9). In the present study
cohort, good risk-2 genotypes were associated with a risk
profile comparable to that of CBF leukemias (5-year EFS
at 67%). Comportment after priming with GM-CSF was
also comparable, showing no difference in terms of longterm EFS compared with absence of priming (Fig. 3A).

Risk groups as defined above are good risk groups (CBF leukemias þ good risk-2), poor risk groups (poor risk-2 þ unfavorable cytogenetics).

Conversely, there was a trend for better results after
priming among poor risk groups (Fig. 3B). Among these
patients, the effect of GM-CSF became significant when
considering patients with initial white blood cell (WBC)
count above the median (>10  109/L; 5-year EFS, 38% vs
12%; P ¼ .02), while there was no difference in patients
with lower initial WBC count. This was confirmed when
considering patients with initial percentage of circulating
blasts above the median (>45%; 5-year EFS, 33% vs 10%;
P ¼ .02) (Fig. 4).
In addition, the difference in terms of EFS was
highly significant in patients presenting either FLT3-ITD
or MLL abnormalities. In FLT3-ITDþ patients, 5-year
EFS was 50% after GM-CSF priming versus only 8% for
those randomized in the arm without GM-CSF (P ¼ .04).
Patients presenting MLL abnormalities also benefited
from GM-CSF priming with 5-year EFS at 31% versus

1728

only 8% for those who did not receive GM-CSF
(P ¼ .03). When combining patients expressing 1 of these
2 molecular markers, the difference in terms of EFS was
highly significant (5-year EFS, 39% with GM-CSF vs 8%
without GM-CSF; P ¼ .007) (Fig. 5).

Risk Factors for Response to Therapy
and Survival
Table 3 provides the results of multivariate analyses for
response to therapy and survival with relative risks and P
values. When considering age, WBC count, percentage of
circulating blasts, arm of first randomization, risk group,
and postremission therapy (for survival), priming with
GM-CSF appeared as an independent favorable prognostic factor for both response to therapy and survival in
terms of EFS and DFS.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies have shown that sensitization of leukemic
cells with G-CSF or GM-CSF may enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in younger adults with newly diagnosed AML,5,15 while other published studies, especially
in elderly AML patients, have failed to show enhanced
therapeutic efficacy of priming.16 The reasons for these

discrepant results have not been resolved but information
regarding the distinct biological entities of leukemia has
not been available in those studies. Cytogenetics is currently regarded as the most important prognostic factor in
AML and was, therefore, herein taken into account for
studying the effects of priming with GM-CSF. However,
research in defining prognostic factors has recently moved
to an examination of molecular markers.17,18 Molecular
profiling develop models offering improvements in risk
stratification and design novel approaches to treat patients
more effectively. Molecular markers are particularly important in patients displaying a normal karyotype.17 The
data presented herein confirm the earlier studies showing
that 2 genotypes, NPM1þ FLT3-ITD and CEBPAþ
FLT3-ITD (which were classified here as good risk-2),
displayed a relatively favorable outcome. This allowed us
to split the intermediate cytogenetic groups into 2 different risk populations and to restructure our global risk classification by grouping CBF leukemias and good risk-2
leukemias in a good risk group, and poor risk-2 leukemias

1730

and unfavorable cytogenetics in a poor risk group. Thus,
when looking at the effect of GM-CSF, not all but only
certain subsets of patients seem to benefit from priming.
The subpopulation of younger adult patients from the
poor risk group seemed to benefit most from CSF priming with respect of EFS, while limited or no effect was
observed among patients from the good risk group. However, other factors seem to be of importance for hematopoietic growth factor priming and should be taken into
account. The schedule of administration seems important
with a better benefit when repeating priming during all
consolidation chemotherapy courses, instead of a unique
sequence of administration during induction chemotherapy.16 It appeared in our study that there was a potentiation of GM-CSF priming with the theoretical effect of
TSC on cell cycle more than only on the cytotoxic efficacy
of cytarabine. Indeed, a significant difference in terms of
CR was initially observed after the first course of induction chemotherapy,5 and a significant difference between
GM-CSF and no GM-CSF was also noted in terms of
EFS among patients receiving the ALFA-9000 TSC consolidation course, while there were no differences for those
randomized in the CALGB-like, high-dose cytarabine
consolidation study arm. These results also suggest a better efficacy in absence of priming of high-dose cytarabine
as consolidation therapy in younger adults with AML.
The type of growth factor may also influence the results of
priming. Although priming with other hematopoietic
growth factors such as G-CSF have shown efficacy,15 this
may not be identical in terms of efficacy to priming with
GM-CSF that is, at least theoretically, more efficient by
recruiting earlier leukemia progenitors and potentially
stem cells instead of only bulk leukemic cells.19 Although
G-CSF stimulates the development of granulocyte colonies, GM-CSF stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils and eosinophils and, at higher
doses, some megakaryocyte colonies. However, G-CSF
stimulates very immature progenitors, and it is known
that G-CSF cleaves SDF1.20 The same has not been
described with GM-CSF, although the capacity of
CXCR4 antagonists to promote mobilization of bone
marrow-derived leukocytes was demonstrated especially
when given in concert with GM-CSF.21
Although a better recruitment of leukemic cells has
been hypothesized, real mechanisms involved in the beneficial role of priming remain questionable. Recent studies
have started to elucidate the role of the bone marrow
microenvironment in the pathogenesis of leukemias and
have demonstrated that leukemic cells settling in the

Cancer

GM-CSF Priming in Adult AML/Thomas et al

niches of the microenvironment are relatively protected
against the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy resistance may be provoked by adherence of the
leukemic cells to the stromal environment via specific receptor and adhesion molecules, such as the CXCR4SDF1a axis. AMLs with high CXCR4 cell surface expression, and with, therefore, a high tendency of stromal protection, have been shown to have a poor prognosis.22,23
Inhibition of CXCR4 has been able to overcome resistance to numerous drugs.24,25 CXCR4 inhibitors that target the stromal interaction and release the leukemic cells
from the microenvironment have both a mobilizing and
cell-cycle activating effect upon leukemic cells and may
sensitize AML for chemotherapeutic cell killing.24,26
CXCR4 inhibitors induced mobilization of AML cells
into circulation and enhanced antileukemic effects of
chemotherapy, resulting in markedly reduced leukemia
burden and prolonged survival.25 These effects resemble
those of AML cell stimulation by G-CSF or GM-CSF,
and synergy between the activities of hematopoietic
growth factors (at least G-CSF) and CXCR4 inhibitors
has been reported.27-29 A mechanism of action for the
beneficial effect of priming with GM-CSF could, therefore, be mediated through CXCR4-induced mobilization.
CXCR4 expression in AML is correlated with FLT3
gene mutation,23 and CXCR4 inhibition increased the
sensitivity of FLT3-mutated leukemic cells to the apoptogenic effects of FLT3 inhibitors. Although the limited
number of patients in each subgroups defined by molecular markers might lead to a cautious interpretation of data,
our results regarding the advantage of priming in patients
displaying FLT3-ITD mutation or MLL abnormalities
are supporting these observations. FLT3 gene mutations
activate CXCR4 signaling. Furthermore, FLT3-ITD is
known to provide a proliferative advantage to a cell population, in which normal maturation is blocked,30 and to
cause synergistic expansion of hematopoietic stem cells
when combined with growth factors.31,32 Similarly, MLL
fusion proteins confer a remarkable growth/survival
advantage.31,33 Although none of our patients presented
simultaneously both anomalies, a positive correlation has
been previously reported between MLL intragenic abnormalities and FLT3 mutations.33 FLT3 might be a therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemias, in which
mutations have been described in the activation loop of
FLT3 resulting in constitutive activation. Furthermore,
FLT3 inhibitors has been shown to be differentially cytotoxic to leukemia cells with MLL translocations.34

Cancer

Relations between FLT3-ITD mutation or MLL
abnormalities and leukemic cell mobilization are also sustained by correlations found in our study between a beneficial effect of priming and high initial level of WBC
count and circulation blasts. Almost all patients with
FLT3-ITD and more than half of those with MLL abnormalities initially presented with such features. The immediate value of these observations will be to test their
potential application in further trials with the aim to treat
patients more effectively.
The results of priming in the ALFA-9802 trial confirm that chemotherapy and sensitization of leukemic cells
and their progenitors by GM-CSF is a plausible strategy
for improving the outcome of younger AML patients.
Even if based on retrospective subgroup analysis, these
results seem to indicate that patients with nonfavorable
cytogenetics or genotypes displaying genetic alterations
implicated in cell mobilization might be those who could
benefit from a priming approach. Of course, additional
long-term randomized studies are necessary before the
strategy of priming with CSFs could be recommended as
standard of care, eventually only in certain patient subsets.
On the basis of in vitro studies and on the clinical experience of the greater sensitivity to chemotherapy of circulating as compared with bone marrow resident leukemic
cells, it is expected that mobilization of leukemic stem
cells with CSF and anti-CXCR4, accompanied by chemotherapy, will result in increased antileukemic effect. Thus,
the mobilization of leukemic stem cells is a concept that is
presently being revisited. In this setting, intergroup collaboration will be necessary to answer relevant questions.
