ABSTRACT
A novel multifunctional nano-drug delivery system based on reversal of peptide
charge was successfully developed for anticancer drug delivery and imaging.
Mesoporous silica nano-particles (MSN) ~50 nm in diameter were chosen as the
drug reservoirs, and their surfaces were modified with HIV-1 transactivator peptidefluorescein isothiocyanate (TAT-FITC) and YSA-BHQ1. The short TAT peptide labeled
with FITC was used to facilitate intranuclear delivery, while the YSA peptide tagged
with the BHQ1 quencher group was used to specifically bind to the tumor EphA2
membrane receptor. Citraconic anhydride (Cit) was used to invert the charge of the
TAT peptide in neutral or weak alkaline conditions so that the positively charged
YSA peptide could combine with the TAT peptide through electrostatic attraction.
The FITC fluorescence was quenched by the spatial approach of BHQ1 after the two
peptides bound to each other. However, the Cit-amino bond was unstable in the acidic
atmosphere, so the positive charge of the TAT peptide was restored and the positively
charged YSA moiety was repelled. The FITC fluorescence was recovered after the
YSA-BHQ1 moiety was removed, and the TAT peptide led the nano-particles into the
nucleolus. This nano-drug delivery system was stable at physiological pH, rapidly
released the drug in acidic buffer, and was easily taken up by MCF-7 cells. Compared
with free doxorubicin hydrochloride at an equal concentration, this modified MSN
loaded with doxorubicin molecules had an equivalent inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells.
This nano-drug delivery system is thus a promising method for simultaneous cancer
diagnosis and therapy.

INTRODUCTION

such as a vitamin, antibody, protein, aptamer, or peptide.
This active targeting strategy could vastly improve the
antineoplastic effects of anticancer drugs and increase
the imaging sensitivity of tumor tissues by enhancing the
signal-to-noise ratio [6–9].
It has been reported that the drug release from
carrier systems occurs mainly in the cytoplasm, so the
maximal anticancer effects cannot be achieved against
targets inside the cell nucleus [10]. One solution to this
has been to incorporate a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) peptide into the carrier system, such as simian
virus 40 T-antigen (SVT) or human immunodeficiency
virus 1 transactivator protein (HIV TAT) [11–13]. The
physicochemical properties, targeting potential and

Chemotherapy has greatly increased the
survival rates of patients with cancer, but traditional
chemotherapeutic drugs lack specificity and thus damage
healthy cells/tissues, resulting in serious side-effects
that immensely reduce the therapeutic effects [1–3].
Recently, nano-medicine carrier systems that actively
and passively target cancerous cells have provided a
promising alternative for the early diagnosis and treatment
of cancer, due to their distinct pharmacokinetics and
biological distribution [4, 5]. The specific targeting and
pharmacology of nano-particles could be improved by
means of a decorating targeting segment on the surface,

transposition mechanisms of these NLS peptides have
been clearly demonstrated. NLS peptides first form
a complex with importin α on the karyotheca. Then,
importin β is recruited to the complex, and the NLS
peptides are conveniently transported into the nucleus
[14–16]. However, NLS peptides can cause serious serum
inhibition and are subject to plasma clearance because
they are highly positively charged. The TAT peptide,
for example, possesses a highly cationic motif of nine
basic amino acids (KKKRRQRRR) [17–19]. Moreover,
these peptides are usually nonspecific for tumor cells and
thus poison normal cells as well. Therefore, single cellmembrane- or nuclear-receptor-targeting peptides are
not the best choice for the decoration of nano-particles
for drug delivery [17–20]. To solve all the abovementioned problems, our research group designed a
drug delivery system based on peptide charge inversion,
in order to achieve continuous multistage targeting and
simultaneously perform fluorescent imaging and nuclear
drug delivery.
Mesoporous silica nano-particles (MSN) are among
the most promising drug-delivery vehicles, and have been
used to fabricate controlled drug-release systems due to
their remarkable properties, including easy synthesis, large
pore volume, modifiable surface, uniform morphology,
high biochemical and physicochemical stability, easy
functionalization, good biocompatibility and very low
cytotoxicity [21–26]. In addition, the vast numbers of
original silanol groups (Si-OH) on MSN facilitate their
post-functionalization [21, 24, 26]. Moreover, the US
Food and Drug Administration has permitted the use of
silicon nano-particles for biomedical applications [27].
Thus, we chose to use commercial MSN formed by a
calcination process with a diameter of ~50 nm as drug
reservoirs, because the cellular nuclear pore complexes
permit the active transport of particles 20–70 nm in size
[14–16, 28, 29].

Thermogravimetric analysis was used to estimate the
grafting ratio of the surface modifications on the MSN.
As demonstrated in Figure 3, the unmodified MSN (curve
a) lost about 2 wt% before 120°C, which was attributed to
the elimination of adsorbed water on the surface [32]. As
shown in Figure 3B, 9 wt% weight loss occurred at 800°C.
With consideration of the 2 wt% for adsorbed water on the
MSN, it can be estimated that the content of CPTS on the
MSN was about 7 wt%.
Second, MSN/COOH was connected with the
TAT-FITC peptides. The carboxyl group of MSN/COOH
reacted with the amino of the TAT-FITC peptide via
amidation reaction. As illustrated in Figure 1, the zeta
potential of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC was higher than
that of MSN/COOH, because the TAT peptides bore
positive charge. As shown in Figure 2C, peak absorptions
at 1200 cm−1 and 1646 cm−1 were apparent in the FT-IR
spectrum of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC, corresponding to the
stretching vibrations of C-N and C = O, respectively. The
peak at 660 cm−1 was attributed to the bend vibration of
N-H. The stretching vibration of N-H was around 3400
cm−1, which overlapped with that of Si-OH [30, 31]. These
results demonstrated that the TAT-FITC peptides were
conjugated onto MSN/COOH. According to curve c in
Figure 3, the amount of TAT-FITC that was grafted onto
MSN/COOH was about 14 wt%. MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC
could be visualized by the green color of FITC under the
fluorescence microscope (Figure 4).
Finally, the YSA-BHQ1 peptides were combined
with MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC through electrostatic
interaction after the charge reversal of the TAT peptides.
The sequence of the YSA peptide was derived from the
EphA2-binding YSA peptide identified by phage display,
which has been reported as an ephrin mimetic peptide
that specifically binds to the EphA2 receptor [33].
EphA2 receptors are overexpressed in many types of
carcinoma cells and tumor blood vessels, while they are
not expressed in quiescent vasculature and are expressed
at low levels in normal tissues and cells [33–35]. The
amino-terminal portion of the YSA peptide appears to
be the most important for EphA2 receptor binding and
selectivity, while the carboxyl terminus is the region more
amenable to modification without an effect on potency
[36]. Thus, we tagged the carboxyl terminus of the YSA
peptide with BHQ1 to avoid reducing the EphA2 binding
activity [37]. The free terminal amine groups of YSA are
cationic at a neutral pH [38]. As shown in Figure 1D, the
zeta potential of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1
was negatively charged (−5 mv). The negative charge of
the nano-particles decreased, because the YSA-BHQ1
peptides were positively charged. This feature has been
shown to extend the in vivo circulation of nano-particles
in the blood vessels by slowing their clearance by the
reticuloendothelial system [39]. The grafting ratios of
citraconic amide and YSA-BHQ1 on MSN were about
6 wt% and 14 wt%, respectively (Figure 3D and 3E). After

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/
YSA-BHQ1/DOX
The synthesis procedure of MSN/COOH/TATFITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX is illustrated in Scheme
1. The functionalization of MSN was performed by a
three-step superficial embellishment process. Firstly,
the hydroxy groups on the MSN reacted with CPTS to
form MSN/COOH, which made the surfaces of the
nano-particles more negative. As illustrated in Figure 1,
the zeta potential of MSN/COOH was lower than that
of crude MSN. The FT-IR spectrum of MSN/COOH
(Figure 2B) displayed peaks at 2900 cm−1 and 1470
cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration and bend
vibration of O-H, respectively. The peak at 1680 cm−1
was due to the stretching vibration of C = O [30, 31].

the loading of DOX, the amount of DOX on the MSN
was estimated to be about 8 wt% (Figure 3F). Fluorescent
imaging revealed that the fluorescence of MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 was quenched under neutral or
alkaline conditions. In contrast, MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/
Cit/YSA-BHQ1 fluoresced in an acidic environment,
and the fluorescence intensity increased as the solution
pH decreased (Figure 4). These results demonstrated
that the YSA-BHQ1 peptides were repelled from MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC under acidic conditions. After the
peptide decoration, the nano-particles were obviously
larger in size than the crude MSN (Figure 5). The TEM
images revealed uniform size distributions for MSN and
MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1, with average
diameters of about 35 nm and 50 nm, respectively.
The surface areas, pore sizes, and pore volumes
of MSN and MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/
DOX were measured by a nitrogen adsorption-desorption
test. Figure 6 displays the nitrogen adsorption-desorption
isotherms of the MSN and MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/
YSA-BHQ1/DOX and the pore size distributive curves
derived from the adsorption branches of the nitrogen
isotherms by the Barrett-Joynere-Halenda method. These
two samples displayed typical IV features for mesoporous
silica according to the IUPAC classification, with welldefined steps at relative pressures of 0.2–0.4P/P0. The
MSN had a high specific surface area (496 m2/g) and pore
volume (0.98 mL/g). However, the specific surface area

and pore volume of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSABHQ1/DOX were reduced to 157 m2/g and 0.27 mL/g,
respectively. This result should be largely attributed to
the attachment of organic groups (i.e., TAT- FITC and
YSA-BHQ1 peptides) and DOX molecules to the MSN
surface or porous structures [40]. The average pore size
of the MSN was 2.2 nm, while the molecular diameter of
DOX was estimated to be about 1.37 nm by Chemdraw
software; thus, the MSN pores were large enough to be
filled by the DOX molecules [41]. However, the average
pore size of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/
DOX was reduced to 0.7 nm, due to the DOX molecules
filling the pores.

DOX loading and release
The loading efficiency and amount of the DOX
molecules in the nano-particles were calculated by the
following equations:
Loading efficiency (%, w/w) = ( (DOX in feed – free
DOX )/DOX in feed) × 100.
Loading amount (%, w/w) = ( (DOX in feed – free
DOX)/nano-particles in feed) × 100.
According to these equations, the loading efficiency
and amount of the DOX molecules were 8.6 ± 1.4% and
39.3 ± 3.5%, respectively, indicating that MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 could be used to effectively
load DOX molecules.

The release patterns of DOX molecules from MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 were investigated
under different pH conditions. As shown in Figure 7,
the release amount of DOX molecules was considerably
limited; only about 10% of the DOX molecules had been
released after 10 h at pH 7.4. This result indicated that the
electrostatic interactions between DOX molecules and

nano-particles were relatively stable under physiological
pH conditions. However, an acidic atmosphere accelerated
the release of DOX molecules; the release ratio reached
19% at pH 6.5 and 34% at pH 5.0 after 10 h, indicating
that the electrostatic interactions between DOX molecules
and nano-particles were weakened by the protonation
effect. This experiment clearly demonstrated that the

In vitro cytotoxicity studies

pH of the medium significantly influenced the quantity
of DOX molecules released from the nano-particles. An
explanation for this phenomenon may be that the acidic
buffer weakened the electrostatic interactions between the
DOX molecules and the nano-particles by neutralizing
the negative charge, such that the DOX molecules were
released from the charged complex. This pH-dependant
release behavior of drug carriers will be beneficial in
promoting the release of DOX molecules at the tumor site,
where the microenvironment is acidic. Thus, MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX exhibited tremendous
potential for use in cancer therapy.

MCF-7 and HEK293 cells were used to assess the
in vitro cytotoxicity of the constructed nano-particles.
As shown in Figure 8A and 8B, MSN, MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC, and MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1
without DOX had very limited effects on the MCF-7
and HEK293 cells at different concentrations, indicating
their good biocompatibility and the very low cytotoxicity
of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 as a drug
vehicle. However, MSN/COOH/DOX and MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/DOX demonstrated obvious toxicity against

MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. As a positive control, free DOX
displayed the strongest inhibitory effect against MCF-7
and HEK293 cells among all the groups. This was because
the molecular size of DOX is about 1.37 nm [41], so DOX
can easily enter into cells and accumulate. The viability of

MCF-7 cells treated with the MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/
YSA-BHQ1/DOX was equivalent to that of cells treated
with free DOX, indicating that the YSA peptides were
beneficial for the uptake of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/
YSA-BHQ1/DOX by MCF-7 cells via EphA2 receptor-

mediated endocytosis, leading to enormous inhibition of
MCF-7 cell growth. After treatment with MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX, the HEK293 cells had
higher viability than MCF-7 cells. The main reason for
this was that far fewer EphA2 receptors are expressed
by HEK293 cells than by MCF-7 cells, resulting in far
lower extent of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus,
it was difficult for MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSABHQ1/DOX to be taken up by HEK293 cells, suggesting
that MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX had
limited toxicity to normal cells.

expression of EphA2 receptors on HEK293 cells. In
addition, MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 had
little influence on the apoptosis of MCF-7 and HEK293
cells. This result again confirmed the safety of MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1.

Intracellular uptake of nano-particles
CLSM was used to observe the uptake of MSN/
COOH/DOX, MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/DOX, MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX and free DOX
molecules by MCF-7 and HEK293 cells (Figure 10). The
red fluorescence represents the DOX molecules, while
green fluorescence represents FITC and blue fluorescence
represents DAPI. As shown in Figure 10, intense red
fluorescence was observed in the MCF-7 cells treated
with free DOX (Figure 10A), indicating that free DOX
could quickly penetrate the cytomembrane and enter
into the cells [42]. However, because free DOX can nonspecifically poison normal cells/tissues and cause serious
side effects, its anticancer potential is limited. MCF-7
cells exposed to MSN/COOH/DOX (Figure 10B) or
MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/DOX (Figure 10C) exhibited a
weak red fluorescence, indicating that a small quantity of
DOX molecules had entered into the cells. Importantly,
MCF-7 cells displayed strong red and green fluorescence
after treatment with MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSABHQ1/DOX (Figure 10D), indicating the abundant
accumulation of nano-particles inside the cells. This was
because the YSA peptides on the nano-particles could

Cell apoptosis study
The apoptosis of MCF-7 and HEK293 cells after
treatment with free DOX, MSN/COOH/DOX, MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ/DOX, or MSN/COOH/
TAT- FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 was measured with a
FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. As shown in Figure 9, the
free DOX molecules strongly promoted the apoptosis of
MCF-7 and HEK293 cells, due to the easy entrance of the
DOX molecules into the cells. Compared with free DOX,
MSN/COOH/DOX induced apoptosis to a lesser extent in
MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. However, MSN/COOH/TATFITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX caused obvious apoptosis of
MCF-7 cells, illustrating that the YSA peptides effectively
targeted the MCF-7 cells and increased the cellular uptake
of the nano-particles. MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSABHQ1/DOX had a lesser effect on the apoptotic ratio of
HEK293 cells, which should be attributed to very low

specifically bind to the EphA2 receptors overexpressed
on the MCF-7 cell surface, such that nano-particle uptake
was accelerated through specific receptor-mediated
endocytosis. Consistent with this result, MCF-7 cells
pre-treated with excess YSA peptides displayed weak
red and green fluorescence after being exposed to MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX (Figure 10E),
because the large number of EphA2 receptors occupied
by free YSA peptides prohibited the receptor-mediated
binding of the YSA-functionalized MSN. Weak red and
green fluorescence was observed after HEK293 cells were
exposed to MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA- BHQ1/
DOX (Figure 10F), implying that only a small amount of
MSN/COOH/TAT- FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX entered
into the HEK293 cells. This was because EphA2 receptors
are mainly expressed by tumor cells and barely present on
normal cells/tissues [33, 43].

was added under stirring (300 rpm) at room temperature
for 24 h in the dark. The samples were retrieved by
centrifugation (9000 rpm, 5 min), washed with ultrapure

DOX molecules were encapsulated by the diffusion
method [46]. Briefly, 10 mg samples of MSN/COOH, MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC, or MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSABHQ1 was dissolved in 10 mL PBS buffer (pH = 7.4), then
supplemented with 2 mg DOX, respectively. After being

(9000 rpm) for 5 min, washed with PBS buffer to remove
the excess DOX molecules, and freeze-dried for further use.
The encapsulated DOX concentration was measured with a
UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV 722N, Shanghai Precision

Samples of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC (10 mg) were
dissolved in 10 mL sodium bicarbonate (0.5 M, pH 9.0).
Then 200 μL Cit was slowly dropped into the solution
under stirring (300 rpm) at room temperature overnight.
During the reaction, aqueous NaOH was added to keep
the pH of the reaction solution above 8 [45]. The samples
were collected by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min,
washed with ultrapure water and redispersed with 10 mL
PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, 1 mg YSA-BHQ1
peptide was added to the solution under stirring (300
rpm) at room temperature. After 8 h, the mixture was
centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min, washed with ultra-pure
water to remove the redundant YSA-BHQ1 and freezedried for further use.

The in vitro release behavior of the DOX molecules
from MSN/COOH/TAT- FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 was

of nano-particles in the MCF-7 and HEK293 cells was
observed with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
(CLSM) (Olympus, Japan). Briefly, the cells were
seeded in a culture dish (1 × 104 cells/dish) which was
dedicated for the CLSM. After 24 h, the culture medium
was replaced with fresh medium containing free DOX,
MSN/COOH/DOX, MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC or MSN/
COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/DOX
(equivalent
DOX concentration of 5 μg/mL) followed by incubation
for another 2 h. Then, the culture medium was discarded,
and the cells were washed three times with PBS buffer
to remove the extracellular free DOX molecules or
nano-particles. DAPI was then used to stain the nuclei,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, the
cells were washed three times with PBS buffer to remove
the extracellular DAPI and were observed with the
CLSM. As a further determination of the involvement of
the EphA2 receptors in the cellular uptake of the nanoparticles, the MCF-7 cells were preprocessed with excess
YSA peptides for 1 h. The cells were then washed with
PBS buffer to remove the extracellular free YSA peptides,
treated with MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA- BHQ1/
DOX for 2 h, washed with the PBS buffer, stained with
DAPI, and observed with the CLSM.

Cell culture
MCF-7 and HEK293 cells were purchased from the
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (IBCB, Shanghai, China). MCF7 cells were chosen for the experiments because they
overexpress the EphA2 receptor, which can specifically bind
to the YSA peptide. Cells were cultured in DMEM/highglucose medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin
G sodium and 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate at 37°C and
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The cell culture medium
was renewed every 48 h. For all experiments, cells were
routinely harvested for measurement. The number of cells
was calculated with a hemocytometer (Perlong Medical
Instruments Inc., Nanjing, China).

In vitro cytotoxicity

The fluorescent pH sensitivity of MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1

The in vitro cytotoxicities of nano-particles or DOXloaded nanoparticles were assessed by the standard CCK8 test. MCF-7 and HEK293 cells were seeded in a 96well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h and then incubated
with the blank (culture medium without nano-particles),
free DOX or DOX-loaded nano-particles at different
concentrations. After incubation for 24 h, the culture
medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 200
μL of 10% CCK-8 per well at 37°C for 2 h. The number
of viable cells was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm
with an Automated Microplate Reader Infinite F50 (Tecan
Group Ltd, Switzerland). The cytotoxicity was assessed by
the percentage of viable cells relative to the blank control.

The fluorescence of MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/
Cit/YSA-BHQ1 under different pH conditions was
observed with a fluorescence microscope (Shanghai Bimu
Instrument Co. Ltd, China). Briefly, 1 mg MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 was dissolved in 5 mL PBS
buffer (pH 7.4). Then the solution was equally divided
into four tubes and the pHs were adjusted to 5.5, 6.5, 7.4,
and 8.0, separately. For comparison, 0.2 mg MSN/COOH/
TAT-FITC or MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit was dissolved in
1 mL PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Then, the fluorescence of each
solution was observed with the fluorescence microscope.
The fluorescence intensities of the solutions were
measured with a Fluostar Optima fluorescence microplate
reader (BMG Labtech GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany)
at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and
530 nm, respectively.

Cell apoptosis
The relative percentage of apoptotic cells was
detected by flow cytometry. Briefly, MCF-7 and HEK293
cells were cultured in a six-well plate at an initial density
of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 and treated with free DOX, MSN/
COOH/DOX, MSN/COOH/TAT- FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1/
DOX, or MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/Cit/YSA-BHQ1 nanoparticles (equivalent DOX concentration of 5 μg/mL) for 24
h, separately. The cells were then harvested, washed twice
with ice-cold PBS buffer, stained with Annexin V-FITC and
PI for 10 min in the dark, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur
Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson Company, USA).

Characterization of the nano-particles
The shapes and sizes of the nano-particles were
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
(JEOL JEM-1200EX microscope, Japan). The infrared
spectra were inspected with a Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer (Nicolet Co., USA). The zeta
potentials of the nano-particles were measured with a
70109

Malvern zetasizer 3000 (England). Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were acquired with a Quantachrome
Nova 3000 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area
analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, USA) at −196°C.
Prior to the adsorption experiment, the samples were
outgassed under a vacuum at 40°C for 6 h. The surface
areas of the nano-particles were calculated by the BrunauerEmmett-Teller means. The pore size distribution was
determined from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms through
the Barrett-Joynere-Halenda method. Thermogravimetric
analysis was performed with a thermogravimetry analyzer
(Pyris 1, PerkinElmer Co., USA) at a heating rate of 10°C
min−1 in a N2 atmosphere from 30°C to 800°C.

Citraconic amide is relatively stable in neutral
and weak alkaline conditions, but is hydrolyzed readily
in acidic media because the neighboring carboxylic
acid group facilitates intramolecular catalysis, which
regenerates its primary amine functionality [47, 48,
50–52] (Figure 11). Therefore, the positive charge of
the TAT peptide was restored in this second charge
reversal (negative charge → positive charge). Due to
charge repulsion, the YSA peptides on the nano-particles
separated from the TAT peptides. Thus, the TAT peptides
(which were previously shielded by the YSA peptides)
were exposed again, the nuclear targeting potential was
restored, and FITC reemitted fluorescence. The TAT
peptide then could combine with the nuclear pore complex
on the karyotheca to form the transport complex, nanoparticle/importin α/β. Subsequently, the drug carrier
nano-particles were transferred into the nucleus. Lastly,
the DOX molecules were released from the nano-particles,
acted on the DNA double-strand, and caused the apoptosis
of the tumor cells.
This nano-drug delivery vehicle had four notable
features: 1. Active and passive targeting of tumor cells.
The outermost YSA peptides could specifically bind to the
EphA2 receptors, therefore facilitating the cellular uptake
of the nano-particles. Meanwhile, due to the enhanced
permeability and retention effect, the nano-drug-delivery
vehicle could easily accumulate in the tumor cells. 2. pHsensitive fluorescent probe. Because citraconic amide
is stable in neutral and weak alkaline environments, the
fluorescence of FITC was quenched by BHQ1. Thus, the
fluorescence should be minimal in the blood circulation
and normal tissues. On the other hand, in acidic conditions
(like those of tumor tissues/cells), the citraconic amide was
quickly hydrolyzed and the YSA peptides were repelled
from the nano-particles, so FITC emitted fluorescence
again; thus, the signal-to-noise ratio was maximized. 3.
High-efficiency intranuclear drug delivery. The temporary
masking of the positive charges of the TAT peptides should
reduce their clearance from the circulation. Through this
“Trojan Horse” method [9], the nano-particles should
be safely escorted into tumor cells. 4. Simultaneous
diagnostics and therapeutics. Fluorescence imaging can
be used not only to assess tumor development, but also
to determine the therapeutic performance of the drugdelivery system. Therefore, MSN/COOH/TAT-FITC/

Statistical analysis
All experiments were carried out in triplicate and
the obtained data were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Student’s t-test was used for statistical
analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the carboxyl groups
were first modified on the surface of the MSN. Then,
TAT peptides labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) were linked to the carboxyl groups. At this time,
citraconic anhydride (Cit), an α-methyl derivative of
maleic anhydride, was mixed with MSN/COOH/TATFITC in order to convert the primary amino groups of the
TAT peptides into carboxyl groups by forming citraconic
amides [47–49] (Figure 11). This was the first inversion
of the TAT peptide charge (positive charge → negative
charge). The resulting negatively charged TAT peptides
could electrostatically bind with the positively charged
YSA-BHQ1 peptides. The latter are short peptides
that specifically bind to the EphA2 receptor, which is
overexpressed in several cancer cell lines [33–35]. Finally,
doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) molecules were trapped
into the MSN. Due to the combination of the TAT and
YSA peptides, the nuclear targeting activity of the TAT
peptides was temporarily shielded. At the same time,
the quenching group (BHQ1), which was used to tag the
YSA peptides, closely approached FITC and quenched its
fluorescence via fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
