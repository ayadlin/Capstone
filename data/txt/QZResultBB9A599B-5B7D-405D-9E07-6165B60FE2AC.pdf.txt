ABSTRACT
Drug repurposing is currently an important approach for accelerating
drug discovery and development for clinical use. Hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) presents drug resistance to chemotherapy, and the prognosis is
poor due to the existence of liver cancer stem-like cells. In this study, we
investigated the effect of the neuroleptic agent pimozide to inhibit stem-like
cell maintenance and tumorigenicity in HCC. Our results showed that pimozide
functioned as an anti-cancer drug in HCC cells or stem-like cells. Pimozide
inhibited cell proliferation and sphere formation capacities in HCC cells by
inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, as well as inhibited HCC cell migration.
Surprisingly, pimozide inhibited the maintenance and tumorigenicity of HCC
stem-like cells, particularly the side population (SP) or CD133-positive cells,
as evaluated by colony formation, sphere formation and transwell migration
assays. Furthermore, pimozide was found to suppress STAT3 activity in HCC
cells by attenuating STAT3-dependent luciferase activity and down-regulating
the transcription levels of downstream genes of STAT3 signaling. Moreover,
pimozide reversed the stem-like cell tumorigenic phenotypes induced by IL-6
treatment in HCC cells. Further, the antitumor effect of pimozide was also
proved in the nude mice HCC xenograft model. In short, the anti-psychotic
agent pimozide may act as a novel potential anti-tumor agent in treating
advanced HCC.

INTRODUCTION

important approaches is drug repurposing, in which new
applications for existing or abandoned pharmacotherapies
are investigated [2, 3]. In cancer therapy, this technique
has achieved affordable results, with new uses found
for existing drugs [4]. For example, metformin is the

most widely used anti-diabetic drug; however, this drug
can also inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo,
functioning as an anti-cancer drug [5, 6]. Disulfiram,
a drug that is widely used to control alcoholism, also
suppresses the self-renewal of glioblastoma and overrides
resistance to temozolomide [7]. Furthermore, the use of
imatinib (Gleevec), a drug that was originally developed
to treat chronic myelogenous leukaemia, has been
expanded to treat several malignancies due to its targeting
of similar signaling pathways [8], such as those in
gastrointestinal stromal tumors [9] and colorectal cancers
[10]. Consequently, finding new uses for existing drugs
represents an effective strategy for developing novel
pharmacotherapies to treat cancer cells.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers worldwide and is a frequent cause of
cancer-related deaths [11]. HCC patients typically have a
relatively poor prognosis because most patients are at an
advanced stage at the time of diagnosis and few effective
therapeutic options are available for this advanced
disease. Moreover, HCC cells are often refractory to
standard chemotherapy and resistant to radiotherapy [12].
Recurrence or metastasis is quite common in patients,
even in those patients undergoing liver cancer resection,
and the survival rate is only 30% to 40% at 5 years
postoperatively [13]. The existence of tumor-initiating
cells or cancer stem-like/stem cells accounts partly for the
chemo-resistance observed in HCC [14, 15]. Extensive
research over the past decade has identiﬁed several specific
cellular signaling pathways that are affected in chemorefractory liver cancer, such as signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), NOTCH, hedgehog
and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which are
involved in the self-renewal, differentiation and survival
of HCC cells [15-18]. Previous studies have shown that
the inhibition of these various signaling pathways via
targeted therapy with small molecule drugs appears to be
a promising approach for the treatment of HCC [18, 19].
Therefore, the screening of existing drugs that potentially
target specific important signaling pathways in HCC is
of prime importance for developing novel and effective
pharmacotherapies for treating advanced HCC.
Pimozide is an FDA-approved neuroleptic drug
that belongs to the diphenylpiperidine class of drugs and
that is commonly used to treat Tourette syndrome and
schizophrenia [20]. Previous studies have shown that
pimozide is efficacious in the treatment of carcinomas
and leukaemias, such as melanoma [21], breast cancer
[22], chronic myelogenous leukaemia [23] and acute
myelogenous leukaemia induced by FLT3 mutations
[24]. The neuroleptic agent pimozide inhibited the
proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 [22] and enhanced the cell death response of MCF-7
cells to gamma-radiation treatment [25]. Furthermore,
pimozide suppressed the self-renewal capacity of chronic
myelogenous leukaemia cells by inhibiting the activity of
the cellular transcription factor STAT5 [23]. However, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effect of pimozide on HCC cells or stem-like cells and its
molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully determined.
The aim of this study was to investigate the
inhibiting effects of pimozide on HCC cells and stemlike cells. The results showed that pimozide inhibited
cell proliferation, migration, colony formation and sphere
formation in HCC cells as well as stem-like cells through
suppressing STAT3 activity. To our surprise, pimozide
reversed the stem-like cell tumorigenic phenotypes
induced by IL-6 addition. Furthermore, pimozide reduced
the tumour burden in the nude mice xenograft model.
Thus, the anti-psychotic agent pimozide may act as a
potential anti-tumor therapeutic drug for HCC treatment,
providing a novel therapeutic agent against advanced
HCC.

RESULTS
Pimozide inhibits HCC cell proliferation in doseand time-dependent manners by inducing G0/G1
phase cell cycle arrest
First, the anti-proliferative effect of the neuroleptic
drug pimozide in HCC cells was detected using MTT
assay. MHCC-97L, Hep 3B, Hep G2 and Huh7 cells were
exposed to a series of concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, and 15
μΜ) of pimozide for 24, 48 and 72 h. As shown in Figure
1A, pimozide inhibited the proliferation of these 4 cell
lines in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. The
IC50 values at 24, 48 and 72 h were 21.57 ± 3.16, 15.97 ±
0.16 and 6.15 ± 0.48 μΜ for MHCC-97L; 44.37 ± 20.45,
5.29 ± 1.09 and 1.81 ± 0.51 μΜ for Hep 3B; 11.43 ± 0.55,
3.96 ± 0.62 and 1.14 ± 0.27 μΜ for Hep G2; and 20.87
± 1.54, 20.23 ± 3.31 and 8.44 ± 0.91 μΜ for Huh7 cells,
respectively. Next, we examined the effect of pimozide on
HCC cells using CFSE staining. The data showed that the
specific regions of CFSE staining in MHCC-97L and Hep
3B cells treated with pimozide for 48 h were greater than
that of the control (p < 0.01) (Figure 1B).
To determine whether pimozide could induce cell
cycle arrest, we analysed the effect of pimozide on cell
cycle distribution using PI staining. After MHCC-97L
and Hep 3B cells were treated with pimozide for 24 h,
the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase increased
significantly compared to the control (p < 0.01; Figure
1C). Following treatment with 10 μΜ pimozide, MHCC97L cells had a significant increase in the percentage of
G0/G1 phase cells, from 51.59 ± 3.49% to 76.95 ± 2.98%.
Further examination of molecular markers associated
with G0/G1 phase arrest showed remarkable increase
in the p21 and p27 levels, and a decrease in the cyclin
D1 level (Figure 1D), which is consistent with the G1
arrest phenomenon observed by flow cytometric analysis.
These results implied that the neuroleptic drug pimozide
represented a potential therapeutic index for treating HCC.

Pimozide inhibits the self-renewal capacity of
HCC cells

levels of N-cadherin and vimentin and up-regulated
the expression level of E-cadherin in a dose-dependent
manner, suggesting that pimozide inhibited HCC cell
migration by suppressing EMT markers expression
(Figure 3C).

Furthermore, we examined whether pimozide
inhibited the self-renewal capacity of HCC cells. The
colony and sphere formation assays showed that pimozide
inhibited the self-renewal capacity of the HCC cell lines
MHCC-97L and Hep 3B in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2A-2D). Following treatment with 5 μΜ pimozide
for one week, MHCC-97L cells showed a decrease of 93.0
± 2.65% in the colony numbers and a significant decrease
in the sphere numbers. Similar results were observed in
the Hep 3B cells.
The expression levels of self-renewal-related
proteins were measured by western blot analysis to
delineate the mechanism of pimozide activity (Figure 2E).
HCC cells treated with pimozide for 48h demonstrated
significantly down-regulated expression of stemness
protein, including Bmi-1, c-Myc and Nanog, but showed
no significant change in OCT3/4 expression. In addition,
RT-PCR assay showed that pimozide down-regulated
transcriptional expression levels of Bmi1 and Nanog of
HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2F). These
results indicated that pimozide inhibited the self-renewal
capacity of HCC cells by suppressing the expression of
key stemness transcription factors Bmi-1, c-Myc and
Nanog.

Pimozide inhibits the self-renewal and migration
capacities of SP HCC cells
Cancer stem and stem-like cells play a pivotal role
in carcinogenesis and tumour recurrence. A previous study
showed that SP cells were a minor subset of cancer stemlike cells in the HCC cell line MHCC-97L [29]. To clarify
the effect of pimozide on HCC stem-like cells, the SP
fraction in MHCC-97L cells was sorted by flow cytometric
analysis (Figure 4A) and displayed respectively resistant
to fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (Cis) and doxorubicin
(Dox) (Supplemental Figure 1A). Pimozide suppressed
the colony and sphere formation capacities in these SP
cells compared to the control (Figure 4B and 4C). MHCC97L SP cells showed a significant 62% reduction in
colony numbers and an 83% decrease in sphere numbers
after treatment with 5 μM pimozide. Figure 4D showed
that pimozide treatment inhibited SP cell migration,
as evaluated by transwell migration assay. These data
suggested that pimozide has the potential to inhibit the
self-renewal and migration capacities of HCC SP cells in
vitro.

Pimozide inhibits the self-renewal and migration
capacities of CD133-positive HCC cells

As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, all of MHCC-97L,
MHCC-97H and Hep 3B cells demonstrated reduced
cell migration capacity after treatment with 5 and 10
μΜ pimozide compared to the control, as evaluated
by transwell migration assay. The ability to migrate in
chambers without a matrix was significantly reduced to
29.03 ± 9.68% and 25.80 ± 5.07% respectively in MHCC97L and MHCC-97H cells, after 5 μΜ pimozide treatment
(Figure 3A and 3B). Furthermore, Hep 3B cells treated
with 5 μΜ pimozide had a decrease of 66.5 ± 2.43% of
migrated cells compared to the control (p < 0.01; Figure
3A and 3B).
In order to detect the toxicity or side effects of
pimozide, apoptotic cell percentage was measured by
Annexin-V-FITC/PI double staining assay. The result
showed that pimozide did not induce obvious apoptosis of
HCC cells (Supplemental Figure 2A and 2B). Moreover,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has gained
increasing attention due to its importance in the acquisition
of metastatic and drug-resistant potential during tumour
progression [28]. Here, we assessed whether pimozide
inhibited HCC cell migration via the EMT process.
Western blot analysis was performed to validate the
expression of the EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin
and vimentin. Pimozide down-regulated the expression

CD133 is a candidate marker for enriching cancer
stem or progenitor cells in HCC [30]. Pimozide obviously
reduced CD133-positive populations in MHCC-97L cell
lines at the concentration of 10 μΜ (Supplemental Figure
3). Also, we further tested whether pimozide showed an
anti-proliferative effect on CD133-positive MHCC-97L
cells. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, CD133-positive
fraction was obtained by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting, and showed resistance to 5-FU, Cis and Dox
(Supplemental Figure 1B). Colony and sphere formation
assays showed that pimozide inhibited the self-renewal
capacity of CD133-positive MHCC-97L cells (Figure 5B
and 5C). Following treatment with 5 μΜ pimozide for one
week, CD133-positive cells showed a decrease of 94.0
± 1.0% in colony numbers and a significant decrease in
sphere numbers. Similar results were shown in CD133negative cells. Furthermore, CD133-positive cells treated
with 10 μΜ pimozide had a significant decrease in
migrated cells compared to the control (p < 0.01; Figure
5D). These results indicated that pimozide could inhibit
the self-renewal and migration capacities of CD133positive HCC cells in vitro.

Pimozide suppresses STAT3 signaling and
reverses cancer stem-like cell phenotypes induced
by IL-6 addition in HCC cells

next examined the effect of pimozide in a nude mice
xenograft model. MHCC-97L hepatic cancer cells were
injected subcutaneously into immunodeficient nude mice.
Treatment with pimozide reduced the tumor burden to a
level comparable to that of the control group, as assessed
by tumor volume (Figure 7A and 7B). Furthermore, both
treatments were well tolerated, with no significant effects
on body weight (Figure 7C). These data indicated that the
neuroleptic drug pimozide had anti-tumor efficacy in vivo
without overt toxicity.

Dysregulated STAT3 signalling has been strongly
implicated in tumourigenesis through its effects on cell
growth, angiogenesis, immune system evasion, and
apoptosis prevention [31]. The activation of STAT3
signaling was reported to maintain the tumor-initiating
ability in HCC cells, with high expression of STAT3
phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 [32]. The STAT3
phosphorylation in CD133-positive HCC cells or SP
HCC cells were detected using Western blotting assay.
Our results showed that CD133-positive cells or SP
cells from MHCC-97L cells had high expression of
phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) and downstream gene
c-Myc (Supplemental Figure 1C), indicating that in stemlike cells of HCC STAT3 signalling was fully activated.
Using qRT-PCR, we found that pimozide treatment
inhibited the transcriptional levels of the STAT3
signaling related downstream genes c-Myc, Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 (Figure 6A). In addition, pimozide reduced
phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) expression in both
MHCC-97L and Hep 3B cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 6B). Furthermore, pimozide inhibited
STAT3-dependent luciferase activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 6C). IL-6 exerts many functions via the
activation of STAT3 signaling in HCC cells, showing high
expression of STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 and
at serine 727 [33]. Western blot analysis showed that IL-6
activated STAT3 signaling in MHCC-97L cells with high
level of phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705), phosphorylated
STAT3 (S727) and c-Myc expression (Figure 6D).
However, pimozide treatment rescued the phosphorylation
expression of STAT3 at the sites of both Tyr 705 and Ser
727, as well as reduced the downstream c-Myc expression
induced by IL-6 addition (Figure 6D).
Moreover, we examined whether pimozide reversed
the phenotypes of cancer stem-like cells induced by IL-6
treatment in HCC cells. Functional assays showed that
IL-6 treatment significantly enhanced the self-renewal
and migration capacities, as evaluated by in vitro colony
formation, sphere formation and transwell migration
assays in MHCC-97L cells, suggesting that IL-6 addition
could enhance the stemness of HCC cells (Figure 6D-6G).
In contrast, pimozide could reverse the IL-6-induced selfrenewal and migration capacities of these cells (Figure
6D-6G), further suggesting that pimozide inhibited STAT3
signaling activity to suppress stem-like cell maintenance
and tumorigenicity in HCC cells.

DISCUSSION
In recent years, increasing numbers of biotechnology
companies have focused on drug repurposing, which is
the development of novel uses for existing drugs [34].
Many existing drugs, such as metformin and disulfiram,
have demonstrated anti-cancer effects in addition to their
original uses. Compared with other types of cancer, HCC
may benefit more from drug repurposing due to its poor
prognosis and lack of effective chemotherapeutic agents
[35].
Pimozide is an FDA-approved neuroleptic drug in
clinical use. Due to its advantages of relatively low side
effects and high clinical safety, pimozide has been used to
treat other diseases in addition to central nervous system
(CNS) diseases. During the past 20 years, pimozide has
been found to be efficacious in treating monosymptomatic
hypochondriacal psychoses, body dysmorphic disorder,
metastatic melanoma, trichotillomania, as well as
trigeminal and postherpetic neuralgia [36]. This study is
the first to report that pimozide could be used as a new
anti-cancer drug for treating HCC.
In our present study, we found that pimozide
inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation and sphere
formation by inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest.
Previous studies have demonstrated that HCC cancer
stem/stem-like cells are not targeted by current systemic
chemotherapies and appear to be resistant to the
conventional chemotherapeutic agents Cis, 5-FU and Dox
[28, 37]. For example, the SP fraction of the HCC cell line
MHCC-97L was found to be refractory to the drug DOX
[28]. Furthermore, CD133-positive hepatic cancer cells
are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents (5FU and DOX) [38]. In this study, MTT assay showed that
CD133 positive cells or SP cells form MHCC-97L were
respectively resistant to 5-FU, Cis and Dox, compared
with their control cells (Supplemental Figure 1A and 1B).
To our surprise, we found that pimozide significantly
inhibited the colony formation,sphere formation and cell
migration abilities of SP or CD133-positive HCC cells.
Down-regulated expression of the stemness genes Bmi1, c-Myc and Nanog was also detected, which indicated
that pimozide inhibited the self-renewal capacity of
HCC cancer stem-like cells and might be preferable to
conventional chemotherapy for targeting liver cancer
stem/stem-like cells.

To delineate the underlying mechanism of the
anti-cancer effect of pimozide on HCC cells, we tested
select classical pathways involved in HCC carcinogenesis
and found that the STAT3 pathway was significantly
suppressed after pimozide treatment. As an oncogene,
STAT3 is constitutively activated by the phosphorylation
of Tyr705 in various human malignancies [31]. STAT3 is
involved in oncogenesis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
self-renewal and drug resistance. Phosphorylated STAT3
dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus for binding to
specific DNA response elements to induce the transcription
of downstream genes, such as BCL-xL, MCL1, and c-Myc
[39]. Accumulating evidence has shown that of the
inhibition of STAT3 activity in cancer cells can inhibit
tumor growth and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity
in HCC cells [40, 41]. In addition, several clinical
studies have reported that STAT3 signaling activation
is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients [42,
43]. Thus, targeting the STAT3 pathway using specific
inhibitors may be a useful cancer treatment strategy with
the potential for broad clinical application. The Janus
kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 can abrogate the activation of
constitutive STAT3 to inhibit growth and metastasis, and
overcome drug resistance in human HCC cells [44]. In
addition, sorafenib, a first-line therapy in treating patients
with advanced liver cancer, demonstrats anti-tumor
activity through the inhibition of STAT3 signaling [45].
Several other chemicals have also shown anti-cancer
activity in treating HCC cells through the inhibition of
STAT3 signaling [46, 47]. In the present study, pimozide
inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3-dependent
luciferase activity, and down-regulated the transcription
levels of STAT3 signaling downstream genes BCL-xL,
MCL1, and c-Myc, significantly indicating that pimozide
targeted STAT3 signaling.
IL-6 induces STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705
and Ser-727 through IL-6 receptors and JAK to activate
STAT3 signalling in HCC cells. IL-6/STAT3 signaling
promotes survival, anti-apoptosis, migration, drug
resistance and self-renewal [48]. Likewise, our data
showed that pimozide decreased IL6-mediated STAT3
phosphorylation and could reverse cancer stem-like
cell phenotypes induced by IL-6 addition in HCC cells,
further suggesting that pimozide may be a potential agent
for treating HCC cells by inhibiting STAT3 signaling and
suppressing cancer stem-like cell maintenance. Besides,
since pimozide is a well-known antagonist of serotonin
5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (5HT7), which was
overexpressed in human hepatocellular cancer (Data not
shown, [49]), whether 5HT7 expression is associated with
STAT3 activation in HCC cells is required to investigated
in future.
Although pimozide causes cardiac toxicity, it has
not been shown to have adverse effects on other normal
functional cells, such as hepatic or haematopoietic cells. A
previous study shows that pimozide decreases the colony
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

formation ability of bone marrow progenitor cells derived
from patients with CML. However, pimozide has almost
no effect on haematopoietic progenitors derived from
healthy donors [24]. Furthermore, pimozide treatments are
well tolerated, with no significant effects on body weight
in a mouse model [24]. Similar results were observed
in our study. Additionally, according to the previous
study, the precise lethal dose of pimozide in humans is
unknown. The oral LD50 is 228 mg/kg in mice, 5120 mg/
kg in rats, 188 mg/kg in guinea pigs, and 40 mg/kg in
dogs (DrugBank: Pimozide (DB01100) [50]). The dose
of pimozide (25 mg/kg) used in our research is relatively
lower compared to the commonly used dose for treating
CNS disease. Therefore, pimozide may also be a safe drug
for treating HCC.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the
neuroleptic drug pimozide displays anti-tumour activity
against HCC cells or stem-like cells and may be a novel
candidate drug for treating advanced HCC. Of note, the
development of new pimozide derivatives with stronger
anti-cancer effects but lower side effects are urgently
needed for advanced HCC [51].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The human HCC cell lines MHCC-97L and
MHCC-97H (purchased from the Liver Cancer Institute,
Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai,
China), HEK293T, Huh7 (provided by the Shanghai Cell
Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai,
China), Hep 3B, and Hep G2 (purchased from American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All
media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and
100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were kept at 37°C in
a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.

Cell proliferation assay using MTT and CFSE
staining
Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The human
HCC cell lines MHCC-97L, Hep 3B, Hep G2 and Huh7
were seeded in 96-well culture plates with 2,000 cells per
well. Subsequently, the cells were treated with pimozide
at different concentrations for various time intervals (24 h,
48 h and 72 h). The cells were incubated for another 4 h
at 37°C after 20 μL MTT (5 mg/ml) solution was added to
each well. The supernatant fluid was removed, and 150 μL
DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance at 490 nm

was finally measured using a microplate reader (BioTek,
Vermont, USA).
To provide a direct measure of cell proliferation,
5or
6-(N-succinimidyloxycarbonyl)-3,6-O,Odiacetylﬂuorescein (CFSE, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
staining was also used for flow cytometric analysis of
cells treated with pimozide for 48 h according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

HCC stem-like cells were collected for functional
assays using SP cells or CD133-positive cells from the
MHCC-97L cell line sorted by flow cytometry.
The SP analysis procedures were based on a
previously described protocol [27]. Briefly, the cells were
trypsinized and suspended in DMEM with 2% FBS and
10 mM HEPES buffer. Next, the cells were stained for
90 min with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye (Invitrogen,
USA) in the presence or absence of 50 μM verapamil. The
incubation was performed with shaking at intervals. After
the cells were incubated, they were resuspended in icecold PBS containing 2 μg/ml PI. Flow cytometric analysis
was performed using a MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The SP gate was defined as
the diminished area on the dot plot in the presence of
verapamil. The SP MHCC-97L cells were used to evaluate
the effects of pimozide.
The CD133-positive population in the MHCC-97L
cell line was sorted by flow cytometry using a MoFlo XDP
cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The cells
were stained with PE-conjugated anti-human CD133/1
(clone AC133-MAC, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA,
USA). Isotype-matched mouse immunoglobulins served
as controls. The CD133-positive cells in the MHCC-97L
cell line were used for further functional analysis.

Cell cycle assay
Cell cycle distribution was determined by propidium
iodide (PI, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) staining and
flow cytometric analysis according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, equal amounts of cells were seeded
in 6-well plates and treated with pimozide at different
concentrations for 48 h. After suspended in cold absolute
ethanol, the cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1%
BSA and stained with PI buffer (40 μg/mL containing 100
μg/mL RNase) for 30 min before flow cytometric analysis.

Colony formation assay
Cells that underwent different drug treatments
were plated in 10% FBS medium. After incubation for
10-14 days, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS,
fixed with 20% methanol, and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet. The morphology of colonies was imaged under a
stereomicroscope. The colony is defined as a cluster of
at least 50 cells. The numbers of colonies were counted.

Western blotting
Equal amounts of protein from each sample
were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Merck Millipore, Billerica MA,
USA). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies
against GAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), p21, Bmi1,
Nanog, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, phosphoSTAT3 (p-STAT3(Ser727) and p-STAT3(Tyr705)), STAT3
(Cell Signaling Technology Corp, Beverly, MA, USA),
p27, cyclin D1, c-Myc, Oct3/4 and β-actin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Antibody binding
was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).

Sphere formation assay
The sphere formation assay was performed as
described previously [26]. To establish sphere cultures,
single cells were cultured in 200 μl serum-free DMEM/
F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 20 ng/ml human
recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF, PeproTech),
20 ng/ml human recombinant basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF, PeproTech), and B27 (1:50; Gibco). The
cells were cultured at a density of 5 × 102 cells/well in
ultra-low attachment plates with different treatments for
7 days, and all of the spheres in each well were imaged.

STAT3 luciferase reporter assay

Transwell migration assay

Transient transfections were conducted using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For the luciferase reporter
assay, HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and
transfected with the STAT3 luciferase reporter plasmid
STAT3-Luc (pGL3.0, Promega, USA). The cells were
collected 48 h after transfection, and the luciferase
activities in the cell lysates were determined using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI,

For this assay, 1 × 105 cells in serum-free medium
were seeded in the upper compartment of a Transwell
chamber (Corning, NY, USA) with different doses of
pimozide. After the cells were incubated with pimozide
for 48 h, the migrated cells on the lower membrane were
stained with 0.1% crystal violet and then counted.

In vivo tumorigenicity experiments
MHCC-97L cells were resuspended in PBS, and
then 5 × 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into
8-week-old male nude mice (BALB/C, nu/nu). A small
tumour formed a week after the tumor cell inoculation, and
mice with established disease were divided into cohorts
(n = 5 per group) with matched tumour burdens. Mice
were treated with either 25 mg/kg pimozide in PEG2000
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) by oral gavage (PO) or a vehicle
at the same volume PO. The treatments were administered
continuously for 7 days. The tumor volumes and body
weights were determined at different times. All studies
involving mice were performed according to protocols
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The
Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.
