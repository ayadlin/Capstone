BACKGROUND: The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has produced promising
results in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders. The authors report the final results
from a multicenter, prospective study examining FCR in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). METHODS: Fortythree patients with symptomatic WM that was untreated or pretreated with 1 line of chemotherapy received rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 intravenously
on days 2 through 4. FCR was repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses. RESULTS: The overall response rate was
79%, and the major response rate of 74.4%, including 11.6% complete remissions (CRs) and 20.9% very good partial
remissions. An amelioration of the quality of responses was observed during follow-up, leading to 18.6% of CRs. No
differences in terms of responses were observed among previously treated or untreated patients. Among the clinical
and laboratory features that were considered, only the b2-microglobulin level had a significant impact in terms of
achieving a major response. The major toxicity reported was grade 3/4 neutropenia, which occurred in 45% of
courses and was the main reason for treatment discontinuation. After the end of treatment, 19 patients (44%) had
long-lasting episodes of neutropenia. Three patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The FCR regimen was capable of neutralizing adverse prognostic factors and proved to be active in
patients with WM, leading to rapid disease control and good-quality responses. Because myelosuppression was the
main concern, further studies are warranted to optimize dosages and treatment duration. Cancer 2012; 118:434–43.

Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by bone marrow (BM) infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells along with the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM)
in serum.1 Over the last 20 years, purine nucleoside analogues have been used in monotherapy for the treatment of WM
and have proven to be effective as both front-line and salvage therapy. In the largest studies, response rates of 30% to 40%
and duration of response of 20 to 24 months have been reported with the use of fludarabine.2-6
Subsequent attempts to augment response rates have been made combining purine analogues with alkylating
agents.7-10 Although the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide has led to high overall response (OR) rates
(range, 55%-85%), in all series, the responses have been categorized only as partial responses (PRs).

FCR in Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Tedeschi et al

Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that
targets the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20, has been used
successfully in the treatment of WM, because most tumor
cells widely express CD20.11-14 Response rates to rituximab monotherapy reportedly vary between 20% and
50% irrespective of whether patients have been exposed
previously to chemotherapy. An increase in the clinical activity of rituximab, mostly in terms of the time to progression, reportedly was observed using an extended schedule
in which 8 infusions of 375 mg/m2 per week were administered in weeks 1 through 4 and weeks 12 through
16.15,16
Preclinical data based on lymphoma cell lines indicated that rituximab sensitized cells to both fludarabine
and cyclophosphamide, enhancing their cytotoxic activity.17,18 Furthermore, in some cell lines, fludarabine exposure resulted in the down-regulation of complementdefense proteins CD55 and CD59.19,20
Clinical trials in patients with WM produced a high
response rate and long-lasting responses when rituximab
was added to nucleoside analogues.10,21,22-26 Treon et al
administered rituximab together with fludarabine to 43
patients with WM and obtained an objective response in
95.3% of patients with a median time to progression of
51.2 months.21 Similar response rates have been observed
in smaller series of patients after the introduction of cyclophosphamide in regimens that contained either cladribine
or pentostatine in association with rituximab (94% and
90%, respectively).10,22
Experience with the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in WM is limited.24-26 The only experience published in the literature
is a report by Tam et al, who obtained a 56% PR rate with
this regimen in 9 patients with WM.24 A better OR rate
(79%) was achieved in our pilot study, which included
heavily pretreated and untreated patients.26 Although no
patients achieved complete remission (CR) after the first
response evaluation, an improvement in the quality of
response was observed in 66% of patients later during follow-up. To confirm the efficacy of the FCR regimen, we
designed a multicenter, prospective clinical trial that
included 43 patients with WM who were previously
untreated or pretreated with 1 line of chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with a diagnosis of WM who were symptomatic
and required therapy based on the consensus recommendation of the Second International Workshop on
Cancer

January 15, 2012

Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia27 and who had received
1 previous therapies were eligible for the study. Patients
were excluded if they had received prior rituximab or concurrent fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. All patients
provided informed written consent in accordance with
the declaration of Helsinki and the institutional
guidelines.
To be enrolled in the study, patients had to meet the
following pretreatment laboratory criteria: alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels 3 times the
upper limit of normal; total bilirubin 2 times the upper
limit of normal, unless clearly related to the disease; and a
calculated or measured creatinine clearance 60 mL per
minute. Baseline evaluation consisted of physical examination, blood counts, hepatic and renal function tests, serum and urine electrophoreses, quantification of serum
immunoglobulins, b2-microglobulin level, BM aspiration
and biopsy, and computed tomography scans of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis.
The FCR regimen consisted of rituximab 375 mg/
m2 intravenously on day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m2 and
cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2
through 4. Rituximab premedication included intravenous diphenhydramine and oral acetaminophen. During
treatment and for 6 months after the end of treatment,
patients received prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii with
oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole thrice weekly and for
herpes simplex and zoster infection with acyclovir 800 mg
daily.
Courses were repeated every 28 days, depending on
recovery of blood counts, for a maximum of 6 cycles. For
episodes of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity, treatment was
withheld until the patient recovered to pretreatment baseline values. A 25% dose reduction of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was allowed for grade 3/4 cytopenia, and
a subsequent 25% further reduction was allowed for other
episodes of grade 3/4 cytopenias. Erythropoietin administration was permitted during therapy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration was allowed at the
physician’s discretion either as prophylaxis or at the onset
of neutropenia.
Before each course of treatment, 1 month after the
completion of FCR, and every 3 months during followup, patients underwent physical examination, blood
counts, hepatic and renal function tests, serum protein
electrophoresis, and serum IgM quantification. The first
disease reassessment, with BM evaluation and CT scans
(for patients who had extramedullary disease at baseline),
was performed after the third course of treatment; patients

435

Original Article

who had progressive disease at that assessment were
removed from the study. BM evaluations and CT scans
were performed to confirm response or progression after
the end of treatment. During follow-up, restaging also
consisted of BM biopsy and aspiration (to confirm CR or
to evaluate a change in response), CT scans, or abdominal
ultrasound studies at the physician’s discretion.
Patients who received at least 1 day of FCR were eligible for the toxicity and response assessment, and the
results were evaluated on an intent-to-treat basis. Toxicity
was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. All adverse events and serious
adverse events were recorded, and serious adverse events
that were collected during treatment and 6 months posttreatment were reported to the local authorities.
Responses were assessed using modified consensus
panel criteria from the Third International Workshop on
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia.28 A CR was defined as
the resolution of all symptoms, normalization of serum
IgM levels with the complete disappearance of IgM paraprotein by immunofixation, no evidence of disease on
BM examination, and the resolution of any adenopathy
or splenomegaly. A very good PR (VGPR), a PR, and a
minor response were defined as achieving a reductions in
serum IgM levels >90%, 50% to 90%, and 25% to 50%,
respectively. Stable disease was defined as a change in serum IgM level <25% in the absence of new or increasing
adenopathy or splenomegaly and/or other progressive
signs or symptoms of WM. Progressive disease was
defined as an increase in serum IgM level >25% from the
lowest attained response value or progression of clinically
significant disease-related symptoms. A major response
was defined as the sum of all CRs, VGPRs, and PRs. Variables that were considered for a possible association with
achieving an OR, major response, CR plus VGPR, developing major infections, and premature treatment discontinuation were age; sex; time from diagnosis to FCR
treatment; pretreatment IgM value >7000 mg/dL; presence of light chain; percentage of BM involvement; extramedullary involvement; a platelet count <100  109/L;
hemoglobin, albumin, and b2-microglobulin levels; the
presence of Bence-Jones; and International Prognostic
Scoring System for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
(IPSSWM) score.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in response rates were analyzed for statistical
significance using the Fisher exact test, and associations
of continuous or discrete variables were measured with

436

the Wald test after logistic regression. Repeated-measures
analyses of variance were used to evaluate variations in
IgM levels within patients. Overall survival (OS) was
measured from the start of FCR treatment to death
because of any cause, progression-free survival (PFS) was
measured from the end of FCR treatment to disease
progression, and event-free survival (EFS) was measured
in responding patients from the end of treatment to
progression or death from any cause. OS, PFS, and EFS
were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method, and
differences were tested for statistical significance using
the long-rank test. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
From February 2005 to April 2008, 43 patients were enrolled in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory features are listed in Table 1. The median patient age was 65
years (range, 36-77 years).
Most of patients (65%) received FCR as first linetreatment. Twenty-eight percent of patients were in
relapse, and 7% had disease that was refractory to a previous line of treatment. Previous treatments included chlorambucil alone or with steroids in 8 patients and
cyclophosphamide alone or with steroids in 7 patients. At
the time of treatment, the median percentage of BM
involvement with lymphoplasmacytic cells was 70%
(range, 10%-95%), and the median serum IgM level was
4380 mg/dL (range, 926-8500 mg/dL). According to the
IPSSWM score, the majority of patients presented with
intermediate-risk or high-risk disease (67%). The primary
reasons for initiating treatment, some of which overlapped, were: worsening cytopenia (n ¼ 32); splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or organ involvement (n ¼ 25)
assessed by CT scan; symptoms and signs of hyperviscosity (n ¼ 6); and peripheral neuropathy (n ¼ 4).
Response
All 43 enrolled patients received the first cycle of treatment and received a median of FCR 6 courses (range, 2-6
courses). Disease reassessment was performed in 39
patients, and the remaining 4 patients were not evaluated
(all received <4 courses) were considered failures. On an
intent-to treat basis, the OR rate evaluated at the end of
therapy was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64%-90%),
including 11.6% CRs, 20.9% VGPRs, 41.8% PRs, and
4.6% minor responses, for a major response rate of 74.4%

the final evaluation. A progressive, significant decrease in
IgM levels was observed among responders between the
end of therapy and up to 18 months of follow-up (P <
.001) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, in patients who had the longest follow-up, reduced IgM levels still were detected after
48 months and 56 months.
Statistical analyses of clinical and laboratory features
revealed that only the b2-microglobulin level (cutoff,
2.5 mg/dL) had a significant impact on the achievement
of major response (Table 3). None of the other prognostic
features that we considered in the study were predictive of
achieving a response.

(Table 2). Among responders, the median time to 25%
and 50% reductions in serum monoclonal protein was 2
months and 3 months, respectively.
In 5 patients, an improved response was achieved
during follow-up after a median of 6 months (range, 3-12
months). In 1 patient, a minor response converted to a
PR, and 3 patients who were categorized with VGPRs
achieved CR. Considering the best response, we observed
a 76.7% major response rate (33 patients), including
18.6% CRs (8 patients), 13.9% VGPRs (6 patients), and
44.1% PRs. No statistical difference in terms of response
was observed between pretreated and untreated patients,
although, in naive patients, a trend was detected toward
achieving a better quality of response (43% vs 14%; P ¼
.086) (Table 3).
Figure 1 illustrates the progressive, significant
decrease in serum IgM levels observed from baseline and
during treatment; a loss of significance was observed
between IgM values detected between the sixth course and

Follow-up
After a median follow-up of 37.2 months (range, 1.0-60.5
months), in total, 5 patients, including 2 treatment-naive
patients and 3 previously treated patients, met the criteria
for disease progression, and 1 patient required retreatment. No difference was observed in terms of PFS when
we compared the patients who achieved CRs plus VGPRs
versus patients who achieved PRs plus minor responses
(Fig. 3). The median EFS was reached after 50.1 months
(Fig. 4); however, even in this analysis, no difference was
observed when patients were stratified according to the
quality of response (CR plus VGPR vs PR plus minor
response; log-rank test, P ¼ .99).
After a median follow-up of 38.8 months (range,
6.6-58.2 months) 11 of 43 enrolled patients died, for an
OS rate of 69.1%. The OS was 88.4% at 2 years and
69.1% at 4 years (Fig. 5). In 5 patients, including 4 nonresponders to FCR, death was related to disease progression. One patient died from conditions not related to
disease or treatment complications. In 1 patient, death

was secondary to the development of acute myeloid leukemia. One patient who had hypoplastic BM was lost to follow-up and died from an unknown cause. Deaths were
related to pneumonia in 3 patients, including 1 patient
who died 2 years after the end of treatment while in continuous CR.
Toxicity
Overall, 226 courses of FCR treatment were administered. The toxicities observed during treatment are listed
in Table 3. In 15 patients (35%), <6 courses were
administered for the following reasons: disease progression (1 patient), pneumonia (2 patients), fever of
unknown origin associated with neutropenia (1 patient),
development of hemolytic anemia (1 patient), rituximab
hypersensitivity (1 patient), and medical decision based
on persisting cytopenia that required continuous supportive treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (9 patients).
The first rituximab administration was associated
with grade 1/2 infusional symptoms in 18 patients, and 2
patients developed grade 3 hypotension. In the subsequent
FCR courses, only 9 episodes of grade 1/2 infusional
symptoms were observed. One patient discontinued treatment after the fourth cycle because of a grade 3 cutaneous
rash, which was categorized as rituximab hypersensitivity.

438

No patients experienced an increase in serum monoclonal protein levels after the first course of treatment.
Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 44.6% courses, at least
1 episode developing in 38 patients. Granulocyte colonystimulating factor was administered in 68.5% of courses.
In 19 patients (44%), long-lasting episodes of neutropenia, alternating in grade, that persisted after the last course
of treatment for a median of 7 months (range, 3-24
months) were recorded. Two patients developed grade 4
thrombocytopenia, which resolved in both patients after
the administration of steroids because of a suspicion of
autoimmune phenomena. Hemolysis leading to severe
grade 4 anemia was observed in 1 patient.
Three patients who were heavily pretreated with alkylating agents developed myelodysplastic syndrome with
a complex karyotype after 5 months, 24 months, and 60
months, respectively. One of those patients died from
acute myeloid leukemia evolution. None of the patients
developed high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Severe extrahematologic toxicity (grade 3/4)
occurred in 2 patients, both of whom required hospitalization because of cutaneous pemphigus vulgaris in 1
patient and hypotension with lipothymia in the other.
Fever of unknown origin was recorded in 7 patients
(9 episodes) during treatment and in 3 patients
(6 episodes) during follow-up.

Nine infectious episodes, including 3 minor episodes and 6 major episodes, that occurred along with neutropenia were documented during treatment and during
the first 6 months of follow-up. The 6 major infections,
which developed in 5 patients (12%), were characterized
by 5 pneumonias (only radiologically documented) and 1
sepsis sustained by Enterococcus faecalis. In 2 of these
patients, pneumonia was the cause of treatment discontinuation. Minor infections consisted of 2 urinary tract infections and 1 herpes zoster.
Three major infections (only radiologically documented pneumonias) were observed after 6 months of follow-up in 3 patients. In 2 of these patients, infection
developed during tardive neutropenia. None of the clinical or disease variables that were analyzed and no previous

opment of delayed neutropenia, major infections, or premature treatment discontinuation.

DISCUSSION
Because of its activity, tolerance, and synergy with other
agents, rituximab is now a component of most frontline
and salvage regimens in WM. The combinations of rituximab with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone29; or rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
and prednisone (R-CHOP)30,31; and, more recently, with
bendamustine32 have produced promising results. Furthermore, Buske et al reported a significantly superior
response rate (94%) and time to treatment failure in

patients with WM and lymphoplasmocytoid lymphoma
who received R-CHOP compared with patients who did
not receive the monoclonal antibody (69%).33
Several studies have assessed the activity of the combination of purine analogues and rituximab in WM. The
addition of rituximab to fludarabine determined a high
rate of response with a long time to progression, especially
in patients who achieved at least a VGPR.21 A high remission rate with good-quality responses and mild toxicities
also were achieved with the administration of 4 courses of
rituximab and subcutaneous 2-chloro-20 -deoxyadenosine.23 Similarly, in smaller series of patients, cladribine
and pentostatine in combination with cyclophosphamide

and rituximab produced OR rates of 94% and 76.9%,
respectively, including 18% and 15.3% CR rates, respectively.10,22 In the literature, many trials have reported
high efficacy and an increase in the quality of responses after FCR in patients with indolent B-cell malignancies and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.24,34-36 To our knowledge,
ours is the first study directed specifically at a large population of patients with WM to assess the efficacy of the
FCR regimen.
On an intent-to-treat basis, we observed an OR rate
of 79%, which is in line with other results reported in literature from larger series of patients with WM who
received rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy regimens. Treon et al,21 in their series of 43 patients,
obtained a major response rate of 86% with combined fludarabine and rituximab, which is slightly superior to the
rate we achieved with the same drugs plus cyclophosphamide. However, in contrast to Treon et al, we observed a
progressive improvement in responses during follow-up,
leading to a higher CR rate (19% vs 5%). Furthermore, it
is noteworthy that the inclusion of cyclophosphamide
allowed us to achieve similar response rates while administering a lower cumulative dose of fludarabine (450 mg vs
750 mg) without increasing infective toxicity. This is an
important issue when considering recently reported concerns regarding the use of purine analogues in WM.37
Even if the OR rate obtained in this study may be
considered similar to the rate reported by Tamburini et al
with the same chemotherapeutic regimen without the
addition of the rituximab monoclonal antibody (77.6%;

all PRs),9 it is important to note that, in our patients, the
addition of rituximab improved of the quality of response,
and 33% achieved at least a VGPR. The importance of
achieving a good-quality response has been reported
recently by Treon et al21 in a series of 43 patients who
received fludarabine and rituximab; because, in that
study, after a long follow-up of 40.3 months, the time to
progression was significantly shorter in patients who
attained less than a VGPR. In our current study, the follow-up was too short to determine whether the good quality of response may translate into longer PFS or OS.
The FCR regimen was effective in obtaining rapid
responses, because the median time to achieving 25% and
50% reductions in monoclonal protein was shorter than
what has been reported with other regimens or immunomodulatory agents in combination with rituximab.21,29,38,39 Furthermore, none of our patients had a
paradoxical increase in serum IgM levels after the initiation treatment. These data suggest that the concomitant
administration of both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide may prevent the flare phenomena and that the FCR
regimen should be considered for patients who require
rapid disease control.
Hematologic toxicity was considerable, and we
observed a high percentage of grade 3/4 neutropenia. A
high incidence of neutropenia, leading to treatment delays
or dose reductions, also has been reported using other
immunochemotherapeutic regimens with or without purine analogs. Grade 3/4 granulocytopenia occurred in
72% of patients who received R-CHOP patients,33 and
numerous episodes of grade 4 neutropenia were observed
after patients received combined fludarabine and rituximab.21 It should be stressed that myelosuppression after
FCR contributed to a high rate of premature discontinuation of intended therapy and led to prolonged episodes of
neutropenia in 44% of patients.
In our study, the infectious episodes observed during treatment and during the first 6 months of follow-up
were in line with those observed using other schedules
that included rituximab.29 The long-lasting tardive neutropenia and the well known immunosuppression related
to purine analogs led to a high incidence of major infections, which were fatal in 2 patients. Therefore, accurate
follow-up of patients and prolonged prophylaxis are warranted in patients who receive combined FCR.
The phenomenon of late-onset neutropenia, which
usually occurs several months after the administration of
rituximab or rituximab-based therapies, is well known.40
The high incidence of delayed neutropenia observed may

raise the question whether the intended therapy should be
limited to 4 courses of therapy or whether the doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide should be reduced, as
reported recently in patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (FCR lite).41 Although the patient numbers
were small, in our series, we observed similar response
rates between patients who completed 6 courses and
patients who completed only 4 or 5 courses. This observation and the progressive amelioration of responses during
follow-up are in favor of reducing the cumulative doses of
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab administered to patients with WM.
Because an objective of our study was the evaluation
of PFS, further chemotherapy to attempt stem cell harvesting was not allowed by study design. Although the
role of autologous stem cell transplantation in WM has
not yet been established, treatment strategies that include
high-dose chemotherapy in young patients with poor
prognostic features may be considered.42,43 From the pronounced and prolonged myelosuppression associated
with BM hypocellularity observed after treatment, we
speculate that stem cell mobilization may be impaired after FCR.
An increased incidence of Richter transformation
and the development of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute
myeloid leukemia in patients with WM who received
nucleoside analog-containing regimens, independent
from previous alkylator therapy, have been recently
reported.37 Although the median follow-up of our study
was shorter than the follow-up in studies that revealed the
long-term consequences of these agents,21,37 3 of our
patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome. These
patients had been heavily pretreated with chlorambucil;
thus, it is plausible that the alkylator played a role in the
occurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome.
In conclusion, the current results demonstrate that
FCR produces rapid responses with high rates of CR and
VGPR in patients with WM. Because myelosuppression
was the most common cause of early discontinuation an d
led to a high incidence of prolonged episodes of neutropenia, further studies are needed to optimize the doses and
duration of this combined treatment regimen.
By modulating doses and therapy duration, FCR
may be considered an effective salvage regimen capable of
neutralizing adverse prognostic factors in patients with
WM. On the basis of the potential risk of secondary
malignancies and the myelosuppressive effects of this regimen, FCR should be avoided as first-line treatment in
younger patients.
