Abstract
Gain of chromosome 6p is a consistent feature of advanced
melanomas. However, the identity of putative oncogene(s)
associated with this amplification has remained elusive. The
chromatin remodeling factor DEK is an attractive candidate
as it maps to 6p (within common melanoma-amplified loci).
Moreover, DEK expression is increased in metastatic melanomas, although the functional relevance of this induction
remains unclear. Importantly, in other tumor types, DEK can
display various tumorigenic effects in part through its ability
to promote proliferation and inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. Here, we report a generalized up-regulation of DEK
protein in aggressive melanoma cells and tumors. In addition,
we provide genetic and mechanistic evidence to support a key
role of DEK in the maintenance of malignant phenotypes of
melanoma cells. Specifically, we show that long-term DEK
down-regulation by independent short hairpin RNAs resulted
in premature senescence of a variety of melanoma cell lines.
Short-term abrogation of DEK expression was also functionally relevant, as it attenuated the traditional resistance of
melanomas to DNA-damaging agents. Unexpectedly, DEK
short hairpin RNA had no effect on p53 levels or p53dependent apoptosis. Instead, we identified a new role for
DEK in the transcriptional activation of the antiapoptotic
MCL-1. Other MCL-1–related factors such as BCL-2 or BCL-xL
were unaffected by changes in the endogenous levels of
DEK, indicating a selective effect of this gene on the apoptotic
machinery of melanoma cells. These results provide support
for DEK as a long sought-after oncogene mapping at
chromosome 6, with novel functions in melanoma proliferation and chemoresistance. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6405–13]

Metastatic melanomas are invariably chemoresistant and carry a
grim prognosis (1). Complicating drug development, melanoma cells
accumulate a plethora of changes in gene expression with the

potential to unleash uncontrolled proliferation, evade senescence
programs, and inhibit death pathways at multiple levels (2). A
hierarchical mapping of these alterations (to distinguish central
nodes in tumor cell maintenance from inconsequential byproducts
of tumor development) has remained elusive. Equally unclear are the
mechanisms underlying common melanoma-associated events that
have been ascribed neither to mutations nor to genetic or epigenetic
alterations. This is particularly relevant for the antiapoptotic
members of the BCL-2 family (BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1). These
proteins are invariably overexpressed in melanoma cells and play
key roles in their chemoresistance (3). BCL-2 up-regulation may be a
consequence of MITF gene amplification (4). BCL-xL and MCL-1 can
be under the control of the mitogen-activated protein kinase or
nuclear factor-nB signaling cascades (5). However, neither MITF,
mitogen-activated protein kinase, nor nuclear factor-nB inhibition
abrogates the expression of these BCL-2 family members (6–8),
suggesting alternative, and yet unknown, mechanisms of regulation
of the apoptotic machinery in melanoma cells.
Alteration of chromosome 6 is one of the most consistent
cytogenetic changes in melanoma (9). In particular, gain of the 6p
arm is prevalent in different manifestations of the disease,
including cutaneous (both sun-exposed and non–sun-exposed),
acral, mucosal, and uveal melanomas (10, 11). Furthermore, temporal clustering of karyotypic changes in melanoma indicates
that 6p gain may represent an early event in the acquisition of
chromosomal imbalances (12). Adding to the clinical relevance
of chromosome 6, 6p copy gains have been associated with poor
prognosis in ocular melanomas (11). Therefore, it has been long
suggested that this genomic region could contain one or multiple
pro-oncogenes (9, 13, 14). Although the minimal region of 6p gain
has not been described in melanoma, several reports in
retinoblastoma and bladder cancer have identified a narrow region
of gain in 6p22-23 (15–18). This region notably contains the
chromatin remodeling factor DEK.
DEK was originally discovered as the target of a chromosomal
translocation event [t(6;9)(p23;q34)] in a subset of acute myeloid
leukemias (19). Subsequent studies have repeatedly identified DEK
as a frequently overexpressed gene in several neoplasms (16, 20–22).
Furthermore, we and others have shown that DEK has effects on
mRNA splicing, transcriptional control, DNA damage repair,
differentiation, cell viability, and cell-to-cell signaling (23–31). Prooncogenic roles of DEK are supported by its ability to inhibit p53mediated apoptosis (32), cooperate with the viral oncogenes E6
and E7 to overcome senescence (29), and promote HRAS-driven
keratinocyte transformation (28). The mechanism(s) through which
DEK mediates its effects, particularly in the context of cellular
oncogenes, is not well understood. DEK is a structurally unique

protein (33) that binds preferentially to euchromatin, although it
can also be found within interchromatin granule clusters (34).
Consequently, it is unclear which DEK targets have a causative role
in tumor development and which are passengers of global changes
of chromatin architecture.
The contribution of DEK to melanoma progression and chemoresistance has yet to be analyzed. Increased DEK mRNA and
protein has been reported in a small number of melanoma cell
lines or tissues (21, 35). However, DEK function is highly dependent
on post-translational modifications (34, 36). Therefore, it is unclear
whether altered DEK expression is a generalized feature of advanced melanomas and whether this gene has a functional
contribution to melanoma cell maintenance and drug response.
To assess these questions, we used tissue microarrays to compare
the expression of DEK among benign nevi and malignant

melanoma specimens. In addition, the role of DEK was defined
in a panel of aggressive melanoma cell lines that recapitulate the
most frequent melanoma-associated defects. Our studies establish
DEK, a gene mapping to the genetically unstable 6p region, as the
first chromatin remodeling factor with dual and selective roles in
proliferation and apoptotic resistance in melanoma, acting
independently of classic tumor suppressor pathways.

DEK protein overexpression in metastatic melanoma. We
hypothesized that gain of 6p in melanoma may function to
promote DEK overexpression. To this end, a panel of 16 metastatic
melanoma lines was selected to reflect the most common
melanoma-associated alterations in oncogenes or tumor suppressors (see Supplementary Table S1). In parallel, primary human
foreskin-derived melanocytes were used as controls for normal
cells. Immunoblotting revealed a generalized high expression of
DEK, with an average 30-fold induction over the basal levels of
normal melanocytes (Fig. 1A and B).
Interestingly, spectral karyotyping confirmed that melanoma cell
lines with high DEK expression (SK-Mel-28 and -29) contained,
among other genetic abnormalities, an increased copy number
of chromosome 6 (Fig. 1C). However, large-scale chromosome 6p
amplifications are unlikely to be the sole mechanism underlying
DEK up-regulation. Thus, lines such as SK-Mel-103 or SK-Mel-147,
with moderate levels of DEK protein (Fig. 1A), had a normal copy
number of chromosome 6 defined by spectral karyotyping
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Comparative genomic hybridization
showed focal gains at 6p22.3 but centromeric to DEK (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To validate the increased DEK protein expression found in cell
lines, an extensive immunohistochemical analysis was done on two
tissue microarrays, containing surgically removed melanocytic
lesions, each spotted in triplicate. Specifically, these tissue microarrays included 87 primary melanomas and 115 metastatic
specimens. In addition, 3 dysplastic nevi, 7 benign nevi, and 5
biopsies of normal skin were included as reference. Notably, 90% of
the tumors analyzed showed clear positive DEK expression (10%
being very marked and 80% with moderate DEK levels; see
representative examples in Fig. 1D, bottom). Normal skin melanocytes and benign nevi showed no detectable DEK expression
(Fig. 1D, top; results not shown). Therefore, these results support
a broad-spectrum up-regulation of DEK during melanoma
progression.
Long-term down-regulation of the endogenous DEK
expression in melanoma induces premature senescence.
Lentiviral vectors were used to transduce short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) and down-regulate DEK in a stable manner. To avoid
complications of off-target effects, three independent shRNAs were
tested (see Supplementary Fig. S2). In 6 of 12 lines analyzed
(SK-Mel-28, SK-Mel-94, G-361, UACC-62, UACC-257, and MM576),

DEK depletion led to a progressive cell cycle arrest, eventually
resulting in a near complete inhibition of cell proliferation as
determined by total cell counting (Fig. 2A) and flow cytometry
(Fig. 2B, top).
The reduction of cells in S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2B, top)
was accompanied by cell enlargement, flattening, and vacuolization
(Fig. 2B, bottom) reminiscent of classic senescent phenotypes (41).
In fact, staining for senescence-associated h-galactosidase activity
was positive in DEK-depleted melanoma cells (Fig. 2B, bottom).
Interestingly, cell cycle arrest and the acquisition of senescent-like
features occurred in cells expressing either wild-type p53 or
mutated p53 (e.g., SK-Mel-94 or SK-Mel-28, respectively; Fig. 2C).
Notably, DEK shRNAs did not affect the expression of p16INK4A
(Fig. 2C), a senescence-associated tumor suppressor. These results
show that DEK is required for the continued proliferation of
metastatic melanoma cells and point to novel p53 and p16 INK4Aindependent senescence programs.
Short-term down-regulation of DEK expression bypasses
melanoma chemoresistance. Recently, we have shown that DEK
can enhance resistance to DNA-damaging agents by promoting
efficient resolution of DNA damage foci (42). Therefore, we sought
to determine whether short term down-regulation of DEK
(therapeutically more feasible than sustained gene inactivation)
could contribute to the ability of melanoma cells to withstand
genotoxic agents. The anthracycline doxorubicin is a potent
antineoplastic agent in other tumor types but has only limited
efficacy against metastatic melanoma (8). This drug was selected
to treat cells with the highest levels of DEK, as they may be
more dependent on this protein for survival (see Fig. 3 for
SK-Mel-19 and Fig. 4 for SK-Mel-29; results with other cell lines are
discussed next). SK-Mel-19 was infected with a control shRNA
lentiviral vector, a vector expressing a single DEK-specific shRNA
(shDEK-1) or a vector expressing two distinct DEK-specific shRNAs
(shDEK-2). Two days after lentiviral infection, cells were treated
with increasing doses of doxorubicin and cell death was estimated
within 24 to 36 h after treatment. Relatively high levels of
doxorubicin were required to kill melanoma cells in the presence
of DEK (>0.2 Ag/mL; Fig. 3A). However, DEK depletion resulted in a
marked increase in doxorubicin-driven cell death, particularly on
dual-shRNA targeting (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the increased response
of DEK-depleted melanoma cells to doxorubicin was associated
with classic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation
(Fig. 3B) and caspase processing (Fig. 3C). Therefore, although DEK
may not be the sole mediator of melanoma chemoresistance, our
results support a key role of this gene contributing to the
malignant features of melanoma cells.
DEK does not modulate p53 levels in melanoma cells. DEK
has been shown previously to mediate antiapoptotic effects
through destabilization of p53 protein and inhibition of p53
activity (23, 32). However, as with the case of long-term downregulation of DEK shown above (Fig. 2C), short-term expression of
DEK shRNA was not found to significantly affect total p53 levels
(Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the activation of p53 (detected by
phosphorylation of its serine 15) and the induction of p53 targets,
such as p21CIP1, were similar in DEK-expressing and DEK-deficient
melanoma cells (Fig. 3C).
DEK-knockdown cells have diminished MCL-1 expression.
Overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members has been
associated with melanoma chemoresistance (3). Therefore, we
tested whether DEK could control BCL-2 family members.
Interestingly, DEK down-regulation with two different shRNAs led

to a drastic decrease in MCL-1 expression in SK-Mel-19, SK-Mel-29,
SK-Mel-5, and MM576 (Fig. 4A; data not shown). Notably, DEK
shRNA did not alter BCL-2 or BCL-xL levels (Fig. 4B), suggesting
selective effects on the apoptotic machinery.
To further assess the requirement of DEK for high MCL-1
expression, DEK-depleted cells were treated with doxorubicin
(which induces MCL-1 levels in melanoma cells; Fig. 4B and C). As
shown in Fig. 4B, DEK shRNA cells ultimately expressed minimal
levels of MCL-1 after doxorubicin treatment (see quantification in
Fig. 4C). Again, the effects of DEK on the apoptotic machinery were
selective, as no changes in BCL-2 or BCL-xL levels were observed
before or after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4B and C). Importantly,
the reduction of MCL-1 expression in DEK-shRNA cells was not due
to proteolytic cleavage by apoptotic caspases (43). Thus, the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, although it eliminated caspase-3
cleavage, could not prevent MCL-1 down-regulation in shDEKtreated cells (Fig. 4D).
Decreased MCL-1 in shDEK-treated cells is not due to
increased MCL-1 degradation. To determine if the decrease in
MCL-1 protein in DEK-knockdown cells was due to enhanced
proteasomal turnover, cells were treated with the proteasome

inhibitor bortezomib. As we reported previously (39, 44), bortezomib
induced a massive MCL-1 stabilization in control melanoma cells
within 2 to 3 h of treatment (Fig. 5A). A similar rate of MCL-1
accumulation was observed in shDEK-expressing melanoma cells
(Fig. 5B), although these cells have, as indicated above, intrinsically
lower basal levels of MCL-1 (note that MCL-1 immunoblots in
Fig. 5A were overexposed to favor the visualization of the endogenous low expression of MCL-1 in shRNA-DEK cells). Therefore,
the diminished MCL-1 levels in DEK-knockdown cells were not
due to increased proteosome-dependent MCL-1 degradation.
To assess the stability of MCL-1 protein in DEK-knockdown cells,
cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor, was used to inhibit de novo
MCL-1 synthesis. To better visualize the decrease in MCL-1
expression, cells were first pretreated with bortezomib to augment
MCL-1 levels. Bortezomib was subsequently removed, and cells
were incubated in cycloheximide and then processed for immunoblotting analysis (see Materials and Methods for additional
details). As shown in Fig. 5C and D, depletion of MCL-1 occurred
with similar kinetics in both control and shDEK-treated cells.
Novel role of DEK in MCL-1 transcription. Because DEK
was not affecting DEK protein stability, it could be controlling

its transcription. To this end, mRNA levels were estimated by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5E, DEK
down-regulation leads to a 50% reduction in MCL-1 mRNA. To
confirm the requirement of DEK for MCL-1 mRNA transcription, a
reporter construct driving luciferase expression under the control
of the proximal region of the human MCL-1 promoter was
transduced into either control or shDEK-transduced SK-Mel-19
cells (Fig. 5F). We found a 70% to 80% reduction in promoter
activity in MCL-1 in the absence of DEK (Fig. 5F). These results
show a new role for DEK in the transcriptional control of MCL-1.
Functional implication of DEK-dependent MCL-1 expression.
To define the specific interplay between DEK and MCL-1 in the

enhancement of melanoma chemoresistance, we generated isogenic series of melanoma cell lines with differing levels of both
proteins and compared their response to doxorubicin. Additional
isogenic cell lines were generated to alter (positively and
negatively) the endogenous expression of BCL-xL. BCL-xL was
chosen as an example of an antiapoptotic BCL-2 factor that is not
under the control of DEK (Fig. 4B) but is also overexpressed in
melanoma cells (3).
To alter MCL-1 expression, we used two approaches. First, we
generated lentiviral vectors to drive MCl-1 from an ectopic
promoter that is not sensitive to DEK. Viral titers were selected
to restore MCL-1 levels to the basal conditions (Fig. 6A, left, inset).

regulation of BCL-2 family members by

In a second set of experiments, the opposite strategy was tested
(Fig. 6B), that is, to abrogate MCL-1 mRNA and protein expression
with shRNAs that we have previously validated (6, 39, 44).
Interestingly, exogenous MCL-1 significantly protected DEKdepleted melanoma cells, reducing the killing activity of doxorubicin in half (Fig. 6A; P = 0.014 for concentrations of doxorubicin of
0.25 Ag/mL). On the other hand, when MCL-1 was depleted, DEK
shRNA was not able to further enhance drug response (Fig. 6B, left;
P = 0.441).
In contrast to MCL-1, altering BCL-xL levels by either overexpression (Fig. 6A, right) or shRNAs (Fig. 6B, right) had no
significant effect on melanoma cell viability whether in the
presence or absence of DEK (see the corresponding P values in
Fig. 6A and B).
From the data presented above, it follows that DEK shRNA may
augment the therapeutic efficacy of small molecules, the antitumor
activity of which depends on MCL-1 inactivation. To examine this
possibility, we tested the small-molecule BH3 mimetic TW-37,
which we have shown previously to act primarily by inhibiting
MCL-1 (6, 38). Interestingly, DEK-depleted SK-Mel-19 cells were
significantly more sensitive to TW-37 treatment than their control
counterparts, showing an accelerated killing (Fig. 6C; P = 0.0110.002) and induction of apoptotic-like features (see chromatin
condensation in Fig. 6D). These results provide proof-of-principle
for the development of rational therapies targeting DEK/MCL-1–
dependent mechanisms of cell survival in melanoma.

Discussion
In this study, we identified new roles for DEK in metastatic
melanoma cells. Despite the high degree of heterogeneity
characteristic of this tumor type, we found that the DEK protein
was invariably overexpressed in all 16 metastatic cell lines
investigated independent of their genetic background. Moreover,
high-throughput immunohistochemical analyses revealed a
marked expression of DEK in 90% of primary and metastatic
melanomas studied. In the same conditions, DEK expression in
normal skin and benign nevi was nearly undetectable. Importantly,
this high expression of DEK was not a simple byproduct of
melanoma development. Abrogation of endogenous DEK expression resulted in the disruption of characteristic malignant features
of melanomas. Thus, long-term expression of DEK shRNAs led to
cell cycle arrest with features of senescence. In turn, acute downregulation of DEK was sufficient to enhance the response to DNA
damaging agents and BH3 mimetics (doxorubicin and TW-37,
respectively). Our results additionally unveiled a previously
undescribed role for DEK in the regulation of a critical mediator
of chemoresistance, MCL-1.
The contribution of DEK to melanoma proliferation and drug
resistance provides mechanistic support for the long-suspected
presence of oncogene(s) mapping to the short arm of chromosome
6 (9, 13, 14). A complication in the identification of the putative
onocogene(s) in this region has been its high gene density (624
genes in the 6p21-23 interval). Moreover, this area is heavily
enriched in CpG islands; therefore, it can be subject to complex
epigenetic regulation. Interestingly, a common area of copy gain at
6p22-p23 in ocular melanomas (11) had also been reported in
bladder cancer and retinoblastoma (16–18). Of the 7 genes in this
region, only DEK was found to have a correlation between copy
gain and gene expression (18). Our spectral karyotyping and
comparative genomic hybridization analyses revealed duplications

of chromosome 6 in melanoma cell lines expressing high levels of
DEK. However, other mechanisms of regulation may favor DEK upregulation, as its expression can also be induced in cells with a
normal copy number at the DEK locus.
Considering the high number of mutations and alterations in
proliferative pathways that melanoma cells express, it is interesting
that down-regulation of a single gene (DEK) can ultimately drive
them into senescence-like cell cycle arrest. In fact, melanomas are
considered to be particularly efficient at overcoming premature
senescence, as this is one of the early barriers to melanocyte
transformation (45). Mechanisms that circumvent premature
senescence in melanomas are not well characterized. In fact, a
puzzling feature of this disease is that a large fraction of acquired
melanomas neither mutate nor delete p53 or p16INK4a, two tumor
suppressors with key roles in the induction of senescence programs
(2). Therefore, DEK overexpression may represent an alternative
mechanism to counteract the tumor suppressor activity of p53 and
p16 in melanoma cells. The precise effects of DEK in promoting
sustained proliferation will require further studies, but it is
tempting to speculate that it may cooperate with other oncogenes
mapping at chromosome 6p, such as c-MYC, which we have
recently shown to control melanoma senescence (46).
Although the requirement of sustained expression of DEK to
avoid premature senescence has implications for basic aspects of
melanoma, the new roles of DEK shown here in the control of
the apoptotic machinery are perhaps more significant from a
therapeutic perspective. Although DEK has been shown previously
to participate in the regulation of gene transcription (23–25, 30, 47),
promotion of MCL-1 expression is the first demonstration of a
transcriptional target of DEK directly contributing to an oncogenic
phenotype. The requirement of DEK for MCL-1 expression is
relevant as this protein has an intrinsically short half life (5); yet, it
is consistently accumulated in melanoma cells (3). In addition,
MCL-1 transcription can be inhibited by p53 (48), E2F1, or E2F2
(40), all of which are expressed in melanoma cells. Therefore, the
effects of DEK on MCL-1 transcription may serve to compensate
for negative regulatory signals intrinsically expressed in melanoma
cells. Furthermore, we and others have shown that MCL-1 is
essential for long-term survival of melanoma cells, and it is a
main determinant of their resistance to dacarbazine, BH3
mimetics, and inhibitors of MEK or the proteasome (6, 44, 49).
MCL-1 can also control melanoma cell survival under conditions of
anoikis (50). Thus, enhanced MCL-1 expression caused by DEK
overexpression may represent a major mechanism of melanoma
cell survival in response to chemotherapeutic agents and other
stress-inducing factors.
In conclusion, our results implicate overexpression of the 6p prooncogene DEK as an extremely frequent event in metastatic
melanomas. Remarkably, this single event can have a dual effect on
melanoma cell proliferation and chemoresistance (preventing
senescence and inducing the antiapoptotic MCL-1, respectively).
Therefore, our results suggest that DEK may be a relevant target for
therapeutic intervention in this aggressive disease.
