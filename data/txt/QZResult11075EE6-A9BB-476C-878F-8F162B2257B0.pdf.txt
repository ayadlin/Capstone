ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations initially respond well to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib. However, clinical efficacy is limited by the
development of resistance. In most cases, this resistance is in the form of the T790M
mutation. Here, we report the design, synthesis and biochemical evaluation of a novel
series of irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) that are derived
from the anilinoquinazoline scaffold. Guided by molecular modeling, this series of
analogs was evolved to target a cysteine residue in the ATP binding site via covalent
bond formation and to achieve high levels of anti-tumor activity in cell cultures and in
xenografts. The most promising compound 13c ((E) –N - (4 - (4 - (3-fluorobenzyloxy)
-3- chlorophenylamino) -7-ethoxyquinazolin-6-yl) -3- ((S) -pyrrolidin-2-yl)acrylamide,
which we named Transtinib) displayed strong anti-proliferative activity against the
H1975 and A431 cell lines with IC50 values of 34 nM and 62 nM, respectively. In
xenograft models, Transtinib significantly decreases tumor size for a prolonged period
of time. These results suggest that Transtinib is a potential cancer therapeutic drug
lead for the inhibition of mutant EGFR to overcome the development of resistance.

pathway, including monoclonal antibodies and small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Small
molecule inhibitors that target EGFR are undoubtedly
successful, and the first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) (Table 1) such as gefitinib (IRRESA)
[10], elotinib (TARCEVA) [11], lapatinib (TYKERB)
[12], and icotinib (CONMANA) [13] have efficacy against
several types of human cancers. Gefitinib, erlotinib and
icotinib were approved for the treatment of NSCLC, while
lapatinib, which inhibits EGFR and HER2 kinases, is used
in combination therapy for HER2-positive metastatic
breast cancer.
To address the resistance of the first -generation
of reversible TKIs, a number of second-generation
irreversible inhibitors were developed based on the
anilinoquinazoline template of gefitinib (Table 1). These
inhibitors contained an acrylamide substituent, a Michael
acceptor system that takes advantage of the covalent

INTRODUCTION
The role of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) is wellknown. Inhibition of the kinase domain of EGFR and
the resultant oncogenic cell signaling disruption by small
molecule inhibitors have been shown to be particularly
beneficial in patients carrying the so-called “sensitizing
mutations” such as L858R and the exon-19 deletion [1,
2], which contribute to nearly 90% of lung-cancer-specific
EGFR mutations [3, 4]. Unfortunately, approximately 70%
of patients respond initially but develop resistance with
a median time to progression of 10-16 months [2, 5-8]. In
at least 50% of these resistance cases, the emergence of a
secondary gate keeper mutation, T790M in exon 20 of EGFR,
occurs in combination with an activating mutation [9].
Over the past several decades, various approaches
have been developed to target the EGFR signaling

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

modification of Cys-797 located at the lip of the ATP
binding clef of EGFR, which is thought to overcome
the resistance of the first-generation inhibitors. These
agents were shown, in pre-clinical models, to be more
potent against the second-site mutation than gefitinib or
erlotinib [14]. The following are several second generation
inhibitors: [(E)-N-(4-(4- ((pyridine – 2 – yl ) methoxy) –
3 -chlorophenylamino) -3-cyano-7- ethoxyquinolin-6-yl)
-4-(dimethylamino)but-2-enamide (HKI-272) [15], (E) –
N - (7 - ((R) - tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy) -4-(3-chloro-4fluorophenylamino) quinazolin-6-yl) – 4 - (dimethylamino)
but-2-enamide (BIBW2992) [16, 17], and (E)-N-(4(3-chloro-4- fluorophenylamino) - 7-methoxyquinazolin6-yl) -4-(piperidin-1-yl)but-2-enamide (PF-00299804)
[18, 19]. However, most of these irreversible EGFR
inhibitors failed in clinical-trials because of their toxicities.
Thus, clinically acquired drug resistance against EGFR
kinase inhibitors is a major challenge in targeted cancer
therapies for NSCLC treatment. Herein, we describe some
of our work that led to the identification of the clinical
candidate Transtinib(13c), a potent inhibitor of both
sensitizing and double mutant forms of EGFR.
We focused our development on modifications
to the solvent region by attaching cyclic systems to the
anilinoquinazoline ring. Therefore, a series of novel EGFR
inhibitors were designed and synthesized by incorporating
acrylamide-based side chains into the C6 position and
alkoxy-based side chains into the C7 position of the
4-anilinoquinazoline scaffold. Different types of anilines
from gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib and other advanced
EGFR inhibitors were substituted into the C-4 position
of the quinazoline template. As Edgar R. Wood et.al [20]
described, the pyrrolidine is a structural feature that is
particularly adept at assisting in protein alkylation in the
active site. In our candidate compounds, we predicted
that pyrrolidine would promote the formation of covalent
binding. Therefore, we introduced a pyrrolidine substituent
into the covalent binding structures.

Chemical names and structures
Three anilinoquinazoline compounds (13a-c) were
synthesized based on scheme 1 and 2. To access compound
11, commercial (S)-(-)-1-Boc-2-pyrrolidinemethanol with
n=1 was used. To access compounds13a-c, R was setted
with n=1. All the structures and names are as follows
(Figure 1).

Transtinib potently and selectively targets
mutant EGFR cell lines in vitro
Transtinib and other two compounds (13a and, 13b)
inhibit cell proliferation in cell lines expressing wild type
and mutant EGFR. The in vitro potency of the compounds
in comparison to gefitinib was determined in three cancer
cell lines. Cell proliferation assays were performed
using the MTT assay with increasing concentrations
of compounds for 72 h. The results expressed as IC50
are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, three
synthesized compounds demonstrated moderate to
excellent anti-proliferative activities against different
cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 34 nM to
95 nM (Table 2). All three compounds were more potent
than gefitinib at activating mutation and the gatekeeper
mutation (T790M). As expected, none of the compounds,
including gefitinib, showed good efficacy against the
SW620. In particular, consistent with molecular modeling
in the ATP pocket of EGFR, compound 13c (Transtinib)
was found to possess higher antitumor activities with
an IC50 of 34 nM in the H1975 cell line with both the
sensitive mutation L858R and the resistant mutation
T790M. Moreover, transtinib exhibited moderate potency
against the WT EGFR cell line (A431) with an IC50
of 62 nM.

Transtinib likely docks into EGFR in a similar
manner as HKI272

In addition to assessing the activity against the
activating and resistant mutants, we similarly assessed the
potency of compounds against the HER2 over-expressing
cell line (N87). N87 cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of either gefitinib, or 13a, 13b, or transtinib
for 72 h. All compounds were effective against WT
HER2, except for gefitinib. Transtinib exhibited was more
effective at inhibiting the growth of this cell line than 13a
or 13b with an IC50 of 47 nM. Thus, transtinib may also
be able to target HER2 in tumors. These results indicated
that the acrylamide and pyrrolidine substituent groups
may increase the binding affinity between compounds
and EGFR. Therefore, transtinib was selected for further
docking and xenograft model studies.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To give structural insight into the ligand/enzyme
interactions and an explanation of the observed activity,
we examined the interaction of ligands with the EGFR
complex structure by molecular docking of compounds
into the ATP binding site of EGFR.
When docking with the WT active state of EGFR,
Transtinib (Figure 2B) was more potent than gefitinib
(Figure 2A). The quinazoline ring is oriented with the 1-N
back of the ATP binding pocket, a hydrogen bond formed
between the Cl substituent and the Met793 residue, and
the van der Waals forces occur among the side chain of
Transtinib and the residues Val726, Leu792, Glu804, and
Pro794. While docking with the DFG-out state, bearing

the T790M mutation, all of the docking results were
poor (data not shown). Thus, we adopted the C-helix out
inactive mode, and as illustrated in Figure 2C and 2D,
our analysis suggested that Transtinib favorably fitted
into EGFR in a similar manner as HKI272. Moreover,
a number of key interactions with the mutant EGFR
(T790M) protein likely contributed to this compound’s
potency. The quinazoline ring is oriented with the 1-N
in the back of the ATP-binding pocket, and the covalent
Michael acceptor (acrylamide group) is located in close
proximity to Cys797, which is feasible for covalent
bond formation. Furthermore, the quinazoline core of
the inhibitor forms hydrogen bond (1.9 Å) interactions
with the backbone amide of the hinge residue Met790
directed toward the gatekeeper. Two other hydrogen
bonds form among the side chain of Transtinib and the
residues Arg841 (1.8 Å) and Thr854 (2.5 Å) of EGFR. We
speculated that the pyrrolidine group may have potential
advantages for the interaction with Arg841 and Thr854,
which would further strengthen the ligand’s affinity
towards the gatekeeper mutant.

To explore the in vivo activity of Transtinib, we
dispensed the drug lead as mono-therapy against mutant
EGFR xenografts on behalf of clinical NSCLC scenarios.
Once daily dosing of Transtinib induced significant dosedependent decreases in tumor size in both A431 and
H1975 tumor xenograft models, with 90% tumor reduction
observed at doses of 5.0 mg/kg/day in both models after 4
weeks (Figure 3A and 3B). Similar tumor reductions were
observed after applying of 5 mg/kg/day Gefitinib. These
studies showed that Transtinib can induce significant
decreases in tumor size at low doses against both EGFR
drug-sensitized and T790M/L858R- resistant EGFR
mutant disease animal models.
We then challenged the durability of tumor reduction
through 16-20 week long- term daily oral dosing of
Transtinib in 8-10 H1975 xenografts (Figure 3C). As a
comparison, gefitinib at 5 mg/kg/day induced less tumor

reduction and tumors began to re-grow after approximately
15 weeks, but an increased dose of 25 mg/kg/day Transtinib
triggered tumor reductions, suggesting that re-growth was
still driven by T790M/L858R-resistant EGFR mutants.
In H1975 xenografts, 5 mg/kg/day Transtinib resulted in
almost complete responses in 9 of 10 tumors at week 11.
No visible tumors were observed after 7 weeks of dosing
at 25 mg/kg/day Transtinib. The complete responses
were maintained for the duration of the study period with
no tumor recurrence during the 20 weeks of treatment.
Moreover, no growth was observed for an additional 5
weeks after Transtinib treatment was terminated.
In comparison, the efficacy against wild-type and
mutant EGFR xenografts was examined. Transtinib did
moderately inhibit tumor growth in A431. However, this
same 5 mg/kg/day dose induced complete tumor reduction
in H1975 mutant EGFR tumor xenografts, suggesting that
Transtinib possesses a novel selectivity margin over WT
EGFR.

Chemistry
A general approach to synthesize the designed
quinazoline compounds is shown in Scheme 1, starting
from commercially available 2-amino-4-fluorobenzoic
acid (1). Unless otherwise noted, all reagents and solvents
were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich and used without
further purification. Dry solvents were purchased as
anhydrous reagents from commercial suppliers.
All of the structures of the compounds were
evaluated by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 400 MHz or 300
MHz, and by MS (BRUKER Autoflex TOF/TOF). 1H
chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm) as s (singlet),
d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),
m (multiplet), and br s (broad singlet) and are referenced
to the residual solvent signal: CDCl3 (7.26) or DMSO-d6
(2.50). The compounds (11) were synthesized according
to Scheme 2.

and the lysine residue on the N-lobe. In addition to these
noncovalent interactions, the covalent bond is formed
between Cys797 and the crotonamide Michael-acceptor
group on the inhibitor.
To predict the possible binding mode in the ErbB
family enzyme active site, Transtinib underwent in
silico screening, and the autoDock4.2 package [24] was
used for molecular docking. In addition, the structures
of HKI-272 and gefitinib were considered as controls.
The docking was performed using the receptor from the
2JIV (HKI272) and 2ITZ (gefitinib) structures from the
RCSC Protein Data Bank. The co-crystal inhibitors were
removed from the initial X-ray structures, water molecules
were then removed, and polar hydrogens and Gasteiger
charges were added using the Autodock Tool. Ligands
were optimized for energy and geometry using MM2 force
fields. The rotational bonds of all proteins were regarded
as being rigid, while the rotational bonds of the ligands
were treated as flexible. All figures were produced using
the open source PyMOL 1.5 package.

colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW620 (no expression

Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI-1640 with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. For EGFR
(wild-type), the human epidermoid A431 carcinoma cell
line (EGFR overexpression) was obtained and cultured in
high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. The ability of the compounds to inhibit
proliferation was measured by the MTT assay. Cell lines
were plated in 96-well plates at between 1,000 and 10,000
cells per well. The cells were allowed to attach overnight
at 37°C under 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours after the cells
were plated, they were exposed to compounds at titrations
concentration and the treated cells were incubated for
a further 72 h at 37°C under 5% CO2. Fresh MTT was
added to each well at a terminal concentration of 5 mg/
mL and incubated with the cells at 37°C for 4 h. The
formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100μl of
DMSO to each well, and the absorbance at 492 nm (for
the absorbance of MTT formazan) and 630 nm (for the
reference wavelength) were measured with the ELISA
reader. All of the compounds were tested three times in
each of the cell lines. The results were expressed as IC50
(inhibitory concentration 50%) and were the averages of
three determinations.

To assess their potential antitumor activity,
compounds 13a, 13b, and 13c (Transtinib) were tested at

harboring either wild-type or mutant EGFR. The first
generation TKI (gefitinib) was employed as the positive
control. For EGFR (T790M/L858R), the human NSCLC

All standard methods for animal model and assays were
approved by the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Xiamen University. Xenografts were bred by injecting
5~7x106 cells (H1975 and A431) with 50% Matrigel in
total volume of 0.5 ml per mice. Before treatment, mice
were randomized to receive Transtinib, gefitinib and the
vehicles. Reagents were diluted with 0.5% lactic acid and
were given by oral gavages. Tumor size was measured
twice a week from an approximate mean starting volume
of 0.32-0.42 cm3. The average tumor size was calculated
by the formula π / 6 × (large diameter, mm) × (small
diameter, mm)2. Statistical significance was evaluated
using a one-tailed Student’s t test.

number of advantages over earlier EGFR TKI agents,
including high cellular potency and superior efficacy
in relevant disease models. In particular, Transtinib,
irreversibly and selectively targets both sensitizing and
resistant-L858R/T790M mutant EGFR with activity
toward the interactive residues (Met790/793 and
Cys797) of the nucleotide binding pocket, showing
promising therapeutic responses in both tumor cells
and mouse models. In the H1975 xenograft model, oral
dosing of Transtinib at 5 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks led to
significant tumor growth inhibition without observed loss
in body weight. Our docking results also suggested that
Transtinib could bind well in the ATP binding pocket
of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in the C-helix out inactive
mode. This promising data for Transtinib strongly supports
its selection as a clinical candidate.
