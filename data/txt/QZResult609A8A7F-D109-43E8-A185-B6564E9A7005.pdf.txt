Abstract
Previous studies in humans and animal models provided
evidence that the Fhit gene is an early target for cigarette
smoke. We compared the induction of a variety of molecular
and cytogenetical alterations in B6-129(F1) mice, either wild
type or Fhit +/, after whole-body exposure to environmental
cigarette smoke (ECS) for 15 consecutive days. Both mouse
genotypes responded to ECS with a loss of Fhit protein in the
bronchial epithelium, accompanied by induction of apoptosis
and stimulation of cell proliferation. ECS induced formation
of bulky DNA adducts in whole lung. In addition, ECS caused
cytogenetical damage both in the respiratory tract and at
a systemic level, as shown by a significant increase of micronucleus frequency in pulmonary alveolar macrophages, bone
marrow polychromatic erythrocytes, and peripheral blood
normochromatic erythrocytes of both wild-type and Fhit +/
mice. These results are compared with those generated in
other species, strains, and genotypes of rodents exposed to
ECS that we investigated previously. Although the loss of Fhit
protein in the bronchial epithelium of ECS-exposed B6-129(F1)
mice provides further evidence that the Fhit gene is an early
molecular target for ECS, heterozygosity for Fhit does not
seem to confer an increased susceptibility of mice in terms of
the investigated early biomarkers. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1001–6]

Introduction
Chromosome 3p is frequently affected by genomic alterations in
a variety of malignancies, also including lung cancer (1). Thus,
deletions and/or loss of heterozygosity at 3p, often with a break at
3p14, have frequently been reported in lung tumors, especially in
smokers (1). This chromosome harbors FRA3B, the most sensitive
among the common fragile sites in the human genome, which is
located at the chromosomal band 3p14.2 (1, 2). Ten years ago, the
Fhit tumor suppressor gene was identified in this region (3). The
Fhit gene is altered by deletion or translocation in many types of
cancers, including lung, cervical, gastric, breast, kidney, oral cavity,
and colorectal cancers (4). Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity at
chromosome 3p14 was found to be more frequent in current
smokers compared with never smokers and occurred frequently
even in histologically normal or minimally altered bronchial
epithelium of smokers, which implies that Fhit might be regarded

as a candidate molecular target for cigarette smoke (5, 6). A dosedependent alteration of Fhit methylation was observed in
bronchoalveolar lavage cells from cancer-free patients, as related
to the number of cigarettes smoked in a lifetime (7). In addition,
the Fhit protein was also reported to be reduced or lost in tumors,
including lung, cervical, gastric, and esophageal cancers as well as
preneoplastic lesions of the lung (8–11).
Recently, we showed that exposure of rats and mice, belonging to
various strains and genotypes, to environmental cigarette smoke
(ECS) for short periods, up to 30 days, results in a significant and
time-related decrease of Fhit gene expression and a loss of Fhit
protein in both pulmonary alveolar macrophages and bronchial
epithelial cells (12). Thavathiru et al. (13) showed that benzo(a)
pyrene [B(a)P] diol epoxide (BPDE), an ultimate metabolite of the
cigarette smoke constituent B(a)P, significantly down-regulates the
Fhit gene expression. These findings confirm the hypothesis that
Fhit might be regarded as a molecular target for cigarette smoke
and its constituents even at early stages of cigarette smoke–related
carcinogenesis (14).
The Fhit protein is thought to be involved in proliferation and
apoptosis of cancer cells (1, 15–17). In addition, the Fhit protein
may be also involved in DNA repair, either directly or indirectly
(18). A loss of Fhit protein would be expected to increase
vulnerability of DNA to genotoxic agents and to render the genome
more susceptible to carcinogen-induced alterations. In fact, Fhit +/
cells showed a higher mutation rate in response to DNA-damaging
agents (19).
A possible approach to investigate the role of Fhit protein in
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis is to use transgenic mice in
which one or both alleles of the Fhit gene are deleted. The murine
Fhit gene is similar in sequence, location, and fragility to its
human homologue, and Fhit +/ and Fhit / mice may serve as a
convenient model to study in vivo the effects of Fhit gene
alterations in chemically induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis
(1). Fhit-deficient mice, either Fhit +/ or Fhit /, were established
by inactivating one Fhit allele in mouse embryonic stem cells.
These mice displayed an elevated frequency of ‘‘spontaneous’’
tumors and chemically induced tumors (20, 21). The Fhit-deficient
mouse model has also been used to prevent tumor development
by gene transfer (22, 23). By using (C57BL/6J  129/SvJ)F1
[B6/129(F1)] mice, either wild type (Fhit+/+ ) or heterozygous for
Fhit (Fhit +/), we showed that Fhit heterozygosity affects
susceptibility of mice to ‘‘spontaneous’’ alopecia patchs and
B(a)P-induced preneoplastic lesions of the uterus, whereas there
was no change in induction of either lung tumors or forestomach
tumors (24).
The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether B6/129 F1
mice, either wild type or Fhit +/, are susceptible to the induction of
early molecular and cytogenetical alterations induced by exposure
of mice to high doses of ECS. The results obtained show that,

irrespective of the Fhit status, these mice undergo a variety of
significant alterations after a 15-day exposure to ECS, including
loss of Fhit protein and increase of apoptosis and proliferation in
bronchial epithelial cells, formation of bulky DNA adducts in the
lung mixed cell population, and induction of cytogenetic damage in
the respiratory tract, bone marrow, and peripheral blood.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Thirty-four B6-129(F1) mice (14 wild type and 20 Fhit +/) were
bred at the Kimmel Cancer Center (Thomas Jefferson University,
Philadelphia, PA) and shipped to the University of Genoa. At the start of
the experiment, wild-type mice weighed 36.2 F 1.79 g (means F SE), and
Fhit +/ mice weighed 34.5 F 0.72 g. The mice were housed in Makrolon
cages on sawdust bedding and maintained on standard mouse chow (MIL,
Morini, S. Polo d’Enza, Italy) and tap water ad libitum. The temperature of
the animal room was 23 F 2jC, with a relative humidity of 55%, ventilation
accounting for 15 air renewal cycles per hour, and 12-h light-dark cycle. The
housing and treatment of mice were in accordance with our national and
institutional guidelines.
Treatment of mice. Seven wild-type mice and 10 Fhit +/ mice were kept
for 15 days in filtered air and served as sham-exposed controls. The
remaining mice were exposed to ECS for 15 days. A whole-body exposure
was achieved by burning 1R3 Kentucky reference cigarettes (Tobacco
Research Institute, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY), having a declared
content of 22.8 mg tar and 1.5 mg nicotine each, in a smoking machine
(model TE-10, Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA). Each smoldering cigarette
was puffed for 2 s, once every minute, for a total of 8 puffs, at a flow rate of
1.05 L/min to provide a standard puff of 35 mL. The smoking machine was
adjusted to burn five cigarettes at one time and to produce a mixture of
sidestream smoke (89%) and mainstream smoke (11%), mimicking exposure
to high-dose ECS. Exposure to ECS was 6 h/d, divided into two rounds with
a 3-h interval, for 15 consecutive days. This accounted for a daily exposure
to the ECS generated by 120 cigarettes. The total suspended particulate
in the exposure chambers was, on an average, 113 mg/m3, and CO was
580 ppm.
Collection of biological samples. At time 0 and after 5 and 15 days,
peripheral blood drops were collected from the lateral tail vein of all mice
and smeared on duplicate slides.
After 15 days, all mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and
killed by cervical dislocation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was immediately done
by lavaging the lungs of each mouse with three 2-mL aliquots of cold (4jC)
0.15 mol/L NaCl infused via a cannula inserted into the trachea. The cells
were washed twice with PBS and then spun in a cytocentrifuge and fixed
with methanol.
The left femur of each mouse was removed and dissected, and bone
marrow cells were smeared on duplicate slides.
The lungs were removed. The left lung was stored at 80jC for the
analysis of bulky DNA adducts, whereas the right lung was fixed
immediately in buffered formalin for 24 h and then embedded in paraffin
for apoptosis and immunohistochemical analyses.
Bulky DNA adducts. Lipophilic DNA adducts, enriched with butanol,
were detected by 32P post-labeling (25) in lung samples from each one of
the 34 mice studied. 32P binding to DNA adducts was catalyzed by T4
polynucleotide kinase (Rockland, Gibertsville, PA), using 64 ACi [g-32P]ATP,
having specific activity z6,000 Ci/mmol (ICN, Irvine, CA) as 32P donor. DNA
adducts were separated by multidirectional TLC on 10  8 cm cellulose
sheets coated with polyethylenimine (Macherey and Nagel, Düren,
Germany), as previously described (25). Radioactivity was measured by
using a 32P imager (InstantImager, Packard, Meriden, CT), and the adduct
levels were quantified by calculating the ratio of cells per minute detected in
DNA adducts and in normal nucleotides. DNA adducts were analyzed in
three separate experiments, in which each sample was tested in duplicate.
The results, expressed as DNA adducts/108 nucleotides, are the means F SE
of the average values obtained in the mice composing each experimental
group.

Immunohistochemical analyses. Fhit and P53 proteins were detected
by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bronchial/
bronchiolar epithelium samples from each mouse, using the Histomouse-SP
kit (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA).
In particular, Fhit was detected by means of a rabbit anti-Fhit polyclonal
antibody, which was kindly supplied by Dr. Kay Huebner (Ohio State
University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH) and used at a
final dilution of 1:2,000. Due to the difficulty of assessing the percentage of
cells positive for Fhit protein, which appears as a diffuse loss of brownish
staining of the cell cytoplasm, the results are expressed as percentage of
mice within each experimental group displaying an evident loss of Fhit. The
appearance of mouse bronchial epithelia, either positive for Fhit or showing
extensive loss of this protein, was shown in a previous article (12).
P53 was detected by means of the CM-5 polyclonal antibody (NCL-P53
CM5p, Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom),
which detects both overexpression and mutation of the P53 gene. The
results, expressed as percentage of P53-positive cells, are means F SE of the
data obtained in the mice composing each experimental group.
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected in slides treated
with poly-L-lysine (Poly-Prep slides, Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO) by
using the NCL-PCNA kit (Novocastra Laboratories), which is based on an
anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (clone PC10) and employs the avidinbiotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex technology (ABC technique).
The results, expressed as percentage of PCNA-positive cells, are means F SE
of the data obtained in the mice composing each experimental group.
Apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotide
transferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) method in the bronchial/
bronchiolar epithelium, using the Tacs XL Blue Label In situ Apoptosis
Detection kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). The results, expressed as
percentage of apoptotic cells, are means F SE of the data obtained in the
mice composing each experimental group.
Cytogenetical analyses. The cytogenetical damage was evaluated in
pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) and bone marrow polychromatic
erythrocytes of mice killed at the end of the experiment and in
normochromatic erythrocytes (NCE) from peripheral blood samples
collected at time 0 and after 5 and 15 days, as described previously (26).
Briefly, peripheral blood smears were air-dried and stained with MayGrünwald-Giemsa, and 40,000 NCE per mouse were scored for the presence
of micronucleated cells. Bone marrow smears were processed in the same
way, and 4,000 polychromatic erythrocytes per mouse were scored for the
presence of micronucleated cells. Two hundred bone marrow erythrocytes
were scored for calculating the polychromatic erythrocytes/NCE ratio.
Methanol-fixed slides of bronchoalveolar lavage were stained with a Giemsa
10% solution, and 1,000 to 2,000 PAM per mouse were scored for the
presence of micronucleated and binucleated cells.
Statistical analyses. Comparisons between groups were made by m2
test to assess the significance of the results expressed in terms of
frequencies and by Student’s t test for unpaired data to assess the significance of the results expressed in terms of means F SE within each
experimental group.

Results
As summarized in Table 1, exposure of B6-129(F1) mice to ECS
for 15 days resulted in significant alterations of almost all
intermediate biomarkers evaluated.
Fhit and P53 proteins in bronchial epithelial cells. All shamexposed mice displayed a diffuse positivity for Fhit in virtually all
cells of the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium, whereas exposure to
ECS resulted in an evident loss of Fhit in approximately half of
the mice, both wild type and Fhit +/. In contrast, the baseline levels
of mutated or inactivated P53, as assessed by using the CM-5
polyclonal antibody, were very low and unaffected by exposure of
mice to ECS, irrespective of the Fhit status.
Apoptosis and proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells. The
frequencies of apoptotic cells and PCNA-positive cells were very

Molecular and Cytogenetical Alterations Induced by ECS

The frequency of micronucleated NCE in peripheral blood was
similar in the four experimental groups at time 0 and after 5 days,
whereas after 15 days, there was a significant increase in ECSexposed mice, either wild type (2.0) or Fhit +/ (1.8).

similar in the bronchial epithelium of sham-exposed wild-type and
Fhit +/ mice. Irrespective of the Fhit status, exposure to ECS
resulted in a statistically significant induction of apoptosis and
proliferation. In particular, the proportion of apoptotic cells was
increased 2.5 in wild-type mice and 1.8 in Fhit +/ mice, and the
proportion of PCNA-positive cells was increased 1.4 and 1.3,
respectively.
Bulky DNA adducts in lung. No well-distinguishable spot was
detected in the lung of sham-exposed mice, whereas the mice
responded to ECS by increasing the levels of bulky DNA adducts,
which were detectable by 32P post-labeling in the form of a
typical diagonal radioactive zone containing one unresolved spot
in the central area (data not shown). The ECS-related increase
of DNA adducts was even higher in wild-type mice (9.6) than
in Fhit +/ mice (5.7), a difference that was statistically
significant.
Cytogenetic analyses in the respiratory tract, bone marrow,
and peripheral blood. After 15 days of exposure to ECS, there was
a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated PAM,
which was of the same order of magnitude in wild-type mice (3.2)
and Fhit +/ mice (2.5). Conversely, the frequency of binucleated
PAM was not affected by exposure to ECS.
At the same time, there was a significant increase in the
frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone
marrow, which was identical (1.5) in wild-type and Fhit +/ mice.
Irrespective of the Fhit status, the polychromatic erythrocytes/NCE
ratio tended to increase in ECS-exposed mice, but the difference
with sham-exposed mice was not statistically significant.

Discussion
ECS is a mixture of sidestream cigarette smoke and, in lower
proportion, of mainstream cigarette smoke exhaled by active
smokers, which can be inhaled by involuntary or passive smokers.
ECS is classified as a human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (27) and by the IARC (28). Like the majority of
known or suspected carcinogens, ECS needs to be assayed at very
high doses to yield detectable effects in animal models (29).
The data generated in the present study by using the B6-129(F1)
agouti mice support the conclusion that rodents are quite
susceptible to induction of ECS-related biomarkers. By disregarding all our previous data obtained with mainstream cigarette
smoke, Table 2 shows at a glance the herein reported results
compared with the findings of previous studies done in our
laboratory by exposing rodents belonging to various species,
strains, and genotypes. In all these studies, mice and rats were
exposed whole-body to ECS for up to four consecutive weeks,
under experimental conditions similar to those described in the
present article. The evaluated end points included biomarkers of
biologically effective dose, such as (a) adducts to hemoglobin of
typical cigarette smoke components (i.e., 4-aminobiphenyl and
BPDE; ref. 25) and (b) bulky DNA adducts in bronchoalveolar

well as in fetus liver (31, 33, 38, 39); (h) proteome profiles, as
evaluated by analyzing 518 proteins in lung by antibody microarrays (40); (i) specific genes or oncoproteins, such as expression of
K-Ras in the lung of mice carrying a mutant P53 transgene (41),
decrease of Fhit expression and loss of Fhit protein in PAM and
bronchial epithelium (ref. 12 and this study), and P53 mutation or
P53 inactivation in bronchial epithelium and skin (refs. 25, 30,
35 and this study); ( j) cytogenetical alterations in various cells,
including PAM (refs. 25, 30, 35, 42 and this study), polychromatic
erythrocytes either in adult bone marrow (refs. 25, 30, 35, 42 and
this study) or fetus liver (31), and peripheral blood NCE, in which
the time course of micronucleus frequency could be assessed (refs.
25, 30, 35 and this study). All the abovementioned end points were
consistently altered by ECS, excepting bulky DNA adducts in adult
rat liver (32); proliferation in mouse skin (35); apoptosis in the
bronchial epithelium of P53 mutant mice (30); P53 mutation or P53
inactivation in mouse skin (35) and bronchial epithelium (ref. 30
and this study); micronucleated PAM in A/J mice and wild-type
(UL53  A/J)F1 mice (30); polynucleated PAM in A/J mice, (UL53 
A/J)F1 mice, irrespective of the P53 status (30); and B6-129(F1)
mice, irrespective of the Fhit status (this study); and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow of (UL53 
A/J)F1 mice, irrespective of the P53 status (30).
Thus, the present study provided further evidence that the
whole-body exposure of rodents to ECS results in a broad variety
of molecular and cytogenetical alterations not only in the
respiratory tract but also at a systemic level. This evidence
contrasts with the difficulty of inducing lung tumors, whose yield
is only weakly enhanced in A/J and other mouse strains exposed
to ECS under peculiar experimental conditions (30, 43, 44). We are
now trying to overcome this problem by exposing mice within
12 h after birth. The rationale for this approach is that during the
perinatal period, there is a tremendous stress, documented by a
sharp increase of the levels of both bulky DNA adducts and 8-oxodG, accompanied by overexpression of many genes in the lung of
newborn mice (45). Preliminary results generated by starting
exposure of mice to mainstream cigarette smoke at birth are quite
encouraging.3
Heterozygosity for Fhit did not render B6-129(F1) mice more
susceptible to the ECS-related molecular alterations investigated in
the present study. In fact, there was no appreciable difference
between wild-type mice and Fhit +/ mice with respect to the loss
of Fhit protein, induction of apoptosis, and stimulation of
proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells and to increase of the
micronucleus frequency in either PAM, bone marrow, polychromatic erythrocytes, or peripheral blood NCE. The levels of bulky
DNA adducts in lung were surprisingly higher in wild-type mice
than in Fhit +/ mice, a finding that is of difficult interpretation.
DNA adducts are promutagenic lesions that are involved in the
initiation of cancer and presumably of other chronic degenerative
diseases as well (46). Their levels are the result of a dynamic
equilibrium between metabolic activation and detoxification

pathways, binding of electrophiles with DNA nucleophilic sites,
dilution of molecular lesions due to cell proliferation, and adduct
removal via DNA repair mechanisms (46). It has been shown that a
preferential repair of BPDE-DNA adducts occurs in the actively
transcribed strand (47), which may imply a differential transcription-coupled repair of DNA adducts in wild-type mice and Fhit
heterozygous mice. In any case, the difference in ECS-related DNA
adduct levels between wild-type mice and Fhit +/ mice does not
seem to be biologically relevant because they were well higher in
ECS-exposed mice than in sham-exposed mice. The observed
patterns may also reflect a different kinetic of DNA adduct formation because, at least in rats, the plateau of DNA adduct formation
in lung and other organs is not yet reached after 15 days of exposure
to ECS (32). In the present study, we had to choose this exposure
time as a compromise for evaluating all monitored end points.
In previous studies done in our laboratories, heterozygosity for
Fhit was found to affect susceptibility of B6-129(F1) mice to
spontaneous alopecia and B(a)P-induced preneoplastic lesions of
the uterus. However, wild-type mice and Fhit +/ mice were equally
susceptible to induction by B(a)P of micronucleated NCE in
peripheral blood and yield of forestomach tumors. Induction of
lung tumors by B(a)P was weak in both genotypes (24). Fhit +/
mice were more susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to
the induction of forestomach tumors by N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA; ref. 21), whereas there was no difference in
spontaneous lung tumors in Fhit heterozygous mice (21). However,
the finding that the bulky DNA adducts in lungs were lower in
Fhit +/ mice than in wild-type animals seems to be consistent with
a previous experiment in which 4-(methylnitrosamino)-I-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)–induced lung tumors in Fhit heterozygous
mice showed an incidence slightly lower than the wild-type
counterpart (48). Although in that study DNA adducts were not
investigated, NNK, a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, is known to
function by initiating a cascade of reactions that results in
production of the adduct O 6-methylguanine, among other DNA
adducts (49). A strong correlation between persistent O 6-methylguanine levels in pulmonary DNA and lung tumors has been
observed in mice (50). At this point, it is probably worth studying
more in detail the relationship among Fhit protein, DNA adducts of
different types, and lung tumor incidence in future investigations.
On the other hand, the lung tumor yield in Fhit-deficient mice was
increased by Vhl haploinsufficiency, which highlights the role of
3p tumor suppressor combinations in affecting the lung tumor
incidence and multiplicity (48).
In conclusion, B6-129(F1) mice seem to be highly susceptible to
induction of a variety of molecular and cytogenetical alterations by
ECS, alike other previously investigated rodent strains. Although
the observed loss of Fhit protein in the bronchial epithelium of
ECS-exposed mice provides further evidence that the Fhit gene is
an early target for cigarette smoke, Fhit +/ mice were not more
sensitive that their wild-type counterparts in developing ECSrelated alterations.
