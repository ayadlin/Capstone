Abstract
The expression of carbonic anhydrase XII (CA12), a gene that
encodes a zinc metalloenzyme responsible for acidification of
the microenvironment of cancer cells, is highly correlated
with estrogen receptor A (ERA) in human breast tumors.
Here, we show that CA12 is robustly regulated by estrogen via
ERA in breast cancer cells, and that this regulation involves a
distal estrogen-responsive enhancer region. Upon the addition
of estradiol, ERA binds directly to this distal enhancer in vivo,
resulting in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and steroid
receptor coactivators SRC-2 and SRC-3, and changes in
histone acetylation. Mutagenesis of an imperfect estrogenresponsive element within this enhancer region abolishes
estrogen-dependent activity, and chromosome conformation
capture and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that
this distal enhancer communicates with the transcriptional
start site of the CA12 gene via intrachromosomal looping
upon hormone treatment. This distal enhancer element is
observed in the homologous mouse genomic sequence, and
the expression of the mouse homologue, Car12, is rapidly and
robustly stimulated by estradiol in the mouse uterus in vivo,
suggesting that the ER regulation of CA12 is mechanistically
and evolutionarily conserved. Our findings highlight the
crucial role of ER in the regulation of the CA12 gene, and
provide insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanism
that accounts for the strong association of CA12 and ER in
human breast cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3505–15]

Introduction
Estrogen receptor a (ERa), a hormone-regulated transcription
factor and member of a superfamily of nuclear receptors (1, 2), is
expressed in f70% of breast cancers (3). As the major regulator of
the phenotypic properties of these breast cancers, ERa markedly
influences the pattern of breast cancer gene expression and,
perhaps more than any other protein, it defines the distinctly
different gene signatures of ER-positive and ER-negative breast
cancers (4–7). In our recent breast cancer gene expression profiling
studies, we observed the carbonic anhydrase XII gene (CA12) to be
robustly stimulated by estradiol (E2) in several ER-containing
breast cancer cells (8, 9). Furthermore, from our examination of
transcriptional profiling data sets in ER-positive and ER-negative

breast tumors, we found CA12 to show one of the most highly
significant positive correlations with ER expression (10–12).
Carbonic anhydrase XII is a transmembrane, extracellular
enzyme and member of a family of zinc metalloenzymes that
catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 to form bicarbonate
+

(H2O + CO2 p
! H +HCO3 ), thereby regulating the microenvironment acidity and tumor malignant phenotype (13–16). CA12 was
originally identified as a protein overexpressed in renal cancer cells
(13), but is now known to be also overexpressed in some other
cancers, including breast cancer (17, 18). Although both CA12 and
the closely related tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9)
are thought to be regulated by hypoxia, only CA12, and not CA9,
exhibits a strong positive correlation with ER expression in breast
tumors (4, 19), suggesting that CA12 might be under ER regulation.
CA12 expression in breast tumors is associated with positive ERa
status, lower grade disease, lower relapse rates, and better overall
patient survival (20–22).
To understand the mechanistic basis underlying this strong
association between ER positivity and CA12 expression, in the work
reported here, we have explored the regulation of CA12 by the ER.
Our results document that the CA12 gene is under primary
transcriptional up-regulation by the estrogen-occupied ER and that
this regulation in breast cancer cells is mediated by ER action
through a distal enhancer that we have herein characterized. Upon
estrogen stimulation, this enhancer binds ERa through an
imperfect estrogen response element (ERE) and recruits p160
coactivators. Furthermore, by chromosomal looping, this ERdependent enhancer communicates with the promoter of the
CA12 gene, markedly enhancing the transcription of the CA12
gene. Our findings define a mechanistic basis for the robust
coexpression of CA12 and ER in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and experimental treatments. MCF-7 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM; Sigma Chemical Co.)
supplemented with 5% calf serum (HyClone), 100 Ag/mL of penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 25 Ag/mL of gentamicin (Invitrogen). T47D
cells were routinely maintained in MEM and antibiotics supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and bovine insulin (6 ng/mL;
Sigma). All cells were grown in phenol red–free MEM supplemented with
5% charcoal dextran–treated serum for at least 5 days prior to use in
experiments.
Animal care and treatments. Eight-week-old ovariectomized C57BL/6
mice were obtained from Harlan Co., and housed under controlled conditions
of light and temperature with free access to standard chow and water. All
experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles and
procedures of the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and were approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. At 16 days after ovariectomy, mice were injected s.c. with E2

(0.5 Ag/animal) dissolved in DMSO then diluted 1:10 in corn oil or with
control vehicle DMSO/corn oil alone. At 4 or 24 h after hormone or vehicle
injection, uteri were removed, weighed after removal of associated fat, and
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR. Cell and
whole uterine total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA samples were
reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 AL using 200 units of reverse
transcriptase, 50 pmol of random hexamer, and 1 mmol/L of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (New England Biolabs). The resulting cDNA was then
diluted to a volume of 500 AL with nuclease-free water. Real-time PCR was
performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT instrument using SYBR Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Briefly, each PCR contained 1 master mix, 4 AL of
the diluted cDNA reaction, and 50 nmol/L of forward and reverse primers
designed to yield 80- to 125-bp amplicons. PCR was carried out through
40 cycles (95jC for 15 s, 60jC for 1 min) following an initial 10-min
incubation at 95jC. Relative expression levels were calculated as described
previously, using acidic ribosomal protein 36B4 mRNA as an internal
control (9). Real-time PCR of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
samples was performed in a similar manner, with appropriate primers.
Small interfering RNA studies. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes
targeting ERa ( forward, UCAUCGCAUUCCUUGCAAAdTdT; reverse,
UUUGCAAGGAAUGCGAUGAdTdT) and control (GL3 luciferase, no.
D-001400-01) were obtained from Dharmacon and transfected into cells
at a final concentration of 20 nmol/L using DharmaFECT transfection
reagent according to the manufacturer’s recommendations at 72 h prior to
ligand treatment.
Immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates of MCF-7 cells were prepared using
1 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) in the presence of Complete
Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration of whole cell lysates was determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce).
Proteins (20 Ag) were boiled in 2 Laemlli buffer and separated by
electrophoresis using 10% SDS-PAGE at 150 V for 50 min, and were then
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall Corp.), using the wet transfer
method at 100 V for 90 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS.
Rabbit anti-human CA12 primary antibody (13) was incubated with blocked
membrane overnight at 4jC. The blot was then washed with TBS containing
0.1% Tween 20 prior to incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody (Zymed Antibodies). The blot was incubated with Super
Signal West Femto enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and
exposed to film in order to observe protein bands.
Genomic cloning, mutagenesis, and luciferase reporter assays. The
indicated genomic DNA associated with estrogen receptor–binding and
intervening regions was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using specific primers and cloned into
either pGL3-Promoter or pGL3-Basic luciferase vectors (Promega) using the
MluI and BglII sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using
QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
All constructs were sequenced to verify their correctness. Briefly, 1,000 ng of
pGL3 reporter vector and 25 ng of pRL-SV40 were cotransfected into MCF-7
cells in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 in OptiMEM according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected for 6 h,
washed, and treated with the indicated ligands for 16 h prior to cell lysis in
1 passive lysis buffer (Promega) and measurement of luciferase activity in
MLX Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies).
ChIP assays. Whole-genome ERa-binding sites were mapped in MCF-7
cells treated with 10 nmol/L of E2 for 45 min using a ChIP-Paired End diTag
(ChIP-PET) cloning and sequencing strategy described previously (23), from
which data was obtained on ERa-binding sites near the CA12 gene.
Standard ChIP assays were performed essentially as previously described
(24, 25), with a few noted modifications. Following the addition of ethanol
vehicle or ligands for the indicated times, MCF-7 cells were cross-linked
using 1% formaldehyde at 37jC for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and
harvested in ice-cold PBS plus 1 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and
10 mmol/L of DTT. Cell pellets were first resuspended in nuclei isolation

inhibitor, and 10 mmol/L DTT], centrifuged at 1,000  g for 3 min, and
resuspended in lysis buffer [0.5% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L EGTA,
50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), protease inhibitor, and 10 mmol/L DTT]. Nuclei
were sonicated (Fisher Scientific, Sonic Dismembrator Model 100) thrice at
80% maximum power for 10 s and the sonicate was centrifuged at 14,000  g.
The supernatant was diluted 1:4 by dilution buffer [1% Triton X-100,
2 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8), protease
inhibitor, and 10 mmol/L DTT] and precleared with 15 AL of preimmune
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 2 Ag of salmon sperm DNA, and 50 AL
of 25% protein A–agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Complexes
were incubated at 4jC overnight with 2 to 5 Ag of antibody, then pulled
down at 4jC for 1 h with 60 AL of 25% protein A–agarose slurry and 2 Ag of
salmon sperm DNA. Antibodies used were for ERa (HC-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), RNA Polymerase II (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SRC-2
(M-343, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SRC-3 (H-270, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and acetylated histone H4 (07-329, Upstate Biotech). Precipitates were
sequentially washed with 1 mL of washing buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton
X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 150 mmol/L
NaCl], 1 mL washing buffer II [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mmol/L NaCl], 1 mL washing buffer III
[0.25 mmol/L LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and
10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)] and twice with 1 mL of TE [1 mmol/L EDTA
and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)]. Chromatin complexes were incubated at
room temperature for 20 min with 100 to 300 AL of elution buffer (1% SDS,
0.1 mol/L NaHCO3). The cross-linking was reversed by incubating at 65jC
overnight with 200 mmol/L of NaCl and 200 mg/mL of proteinase K
(Invitrogen Corp.). DNA was purified with QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and
amplified by real-time PCR.
Chromosome conformation capture assays. MCF-7 cells were grown
according to the protocol for ChIP assays above and treated with the
indicated ligands for 45 min prior to fixation in 2% formaldehyde at
37jC for 10 min. The formaldehyde was quenched with the addition of
0.125 mol/L of glycine and cells were lysed in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris
(pH 8.0), 10 mmol/L NaCl, 0.2% NP40, and 1 Complete Protease Inhibitors
(Roche)] at 4jC for 90 min. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 New England
Biolabs Buffer 2, 0.3% SDS and incubated at 37jC for 60 min while rotating.
Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the
SDS and incubated at 37jC for 60 min while rotating. The chromatin was
then digested overnight using MseI (New England Biolabs) or BtgI (New
England Biolabs) at 37jC while rotating. SDS was added to a final volume of
1.6% and the samples were heated at 65jC for 20 min. Two-microgram
aliquots of the chromatin samples were diluted in ligation buffer containing
1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 37jC for 1 h. The temperature was
lowered to 16jC and T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) was added and
samples were incubated overnight. The ligated DNA was purified using
phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed using PCR amplification.
Resulting PCR products were sequenced and mapped back to the UCSC
Genome Browser for verification.

Results
CA12 regulation by estrogen is a primary transcriptional
response mediated by the estrogen receptor. In our prior
transcriptional profiling microarray analyses of gene expression
stimulation by E2 in ER-positive breast cancer and osteosarcoma
cells (8, 9, 26), we observed a very marked up-regulation of CA12
gene expression by E2. To investigate CA12 regulation by estrogen
in breast cancer in greater detail, and to elucidate the mechanism
underlying this regulation, we first examined the time course of
CA12 mRNA and protein increases in response to E2 and selective
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) in ERa-positive MCF-7 and
T47D breast cancer cells. CA12 RNA was significantly stimulated
after 2 hours of E2 exposure and continued to increase to maximal
stimulation levels by 4 and 8 hours in MCF-7 and T47D cells,
respectively, and remained greatly elevated throughout the
48 hours of treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Increases in

CA12 protein levels were detected in as early as 2 to 4 hours, and
continued to increase throughout the time course of treatment
(Fig. 1B), consistent with the early and sustained stimulation of CA12
RNA by E2. The SERMs, trans-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene,
induced CA12 RNA by 3-fold to 4-fold, f40% of that obtained with
E2 (Fig. 1C), and in a similar manner, trans-hydroxytamoxifen and
raloxifene stimulated CA12 protein to approximately one-third that
of E2 (Fig. 1D). The ER full antagonist and selective estrogen
receptor down-regulator, fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), had no stimulatory effect on CA12 RNA, and it was able to inhibit the E2-, transhydroxytamoxifen–, and raloxifene-mediated stimulation of CA12
(Fig. 1C). Of the other steroid receptor ligands examined, only
dihydrotestosterone was able to mildly stimulate CA12, possibly
through androgen receptor or because of its low affinity for ER (27),
whereas the glucocorticoid receptor and progesterone receptor
agonists, hydrocortisone and medroxyprogesterone acetate,
respectively, did not regulate CA12 expression (Fig. 1C).
We next examined the requirement of the estrogen receptor
itself for E2-mediated stimulation of CA12 mRNA. MCF-7 cells were
pretreated for 60 minutes with vehicle or a log2 molar excess of
fulvestrant prior to treatment with E2; CA12 mRNA and protein
levels were assessed after 2 or 8 hours, respectively (Fig. 2A and B).
Fulvestrant did not increase CA12 mRNA or protein, but it was able
to fully inhibit the E2-mediated up-regulation. We also examined
the requirement of ER in CA12 mRNA stimulation by siRNAmediated depletion of ERa from MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were
transfected with siRNA which was shown to deplete cells of >95%
of ERa (data not shown). Loss of ER at 72 hours posttransfection

reduced the basal CA12 mRNA level, likely due to possible ligandindependent ER transactivation activity, and abolished the E2- and
SERM-mediated stimulation of CA12 (Fig. 2C). These results
indicate that ER is required for SERM regulation of the CA12 gene.
In addition to the ER itself, we also determined the requirement
of ongoing transcription and translation for E2 stimulation of
CA12. MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 60 minutes with the RNA
polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D or the translational inhibitor
cycloheximide prior to treatment with E2 (Fig. 2A). The E2mediated stimulation of CA12 mRNA (or trans-hydroxytamoxifen– or
raloxifene-mediated increase in CA12 mRNA; data not shown) was
inhibited by actinomycin D, but not cycloheximide, suggesting that
ongoing transcription, but not synthesis of new protein factors, is
necessary for CA12 mRNA stimulation by the ER. Taken together,
these results suggest that CA12 regulation by estrogen is a primary
transcriptional response mediated by the ER.
Because of our observations of the requirement of ER for CA12
regulation, we examined CA12 expression in primary ER-positive
breast tumors by analysis of several gene expression data sets from
ER-positive breast tumors (Fig. 2D). These analyses reveal a very
positive correlation of CA12 expression with ERa expression in
primary breast tumors, shown in the scatter plots in Fig. 2D. Our
findings highlighting the crucial role of ER in CA12 up-regulation
may account for the robust coexpression of CA12 and ERa
observed in human breast cancers.
E2-bound ER is recruited to a distal region upstream of the
CA12 transcription start site in vivo. The ER primarily functions
as a signal-activated transcriptional transactivator through direct

ERa-expressing MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with 10 nmol/L of E2 for 0 to 48 h. RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and cDNA
measured by quantitative PCR using primers for CA12 and internal control 36B4 mRNA. B, CA12 protein levels are induced by E2 in a time-dependent manner.
MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 nmol/L of E2 for 0 to 24 h and total cellular lysates were used for CA12 immunoblotting. C, CA12 mRNA is induced by ER agonists.

E2, trans -hydroxytamoxifen (Tam; 100 nmol/L), fulvestrant + trans -hydroxytamoxifen, raloxifene (Ral ; 100 nmol/L), fulvestrant + raloxifene, dihydrotestosterone

Figure 2. E2 stimulation of CA12 gene expression is sensitive to actinomycin D and fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), but not cycloheximide, and requires ERa. Strong
association of CA12 and ERa in breast tumor data sets. A, CA12 mRNA induction by E2 is blocked by pretreatment with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D,
or the pure ER antagonist fulvestrant, but not the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 60 min with 0.1% DMSO, 1 Amol/L of fulvestrant,
10 Ag/mL of cycloheximide (CHX ), or 5 Amol/L of actinomycin D (Act.D) and then 0.1% ethanol or 10 nmol/L of E2 was added for 2 h. qRT-PCR for CA12 mRNA
was performed. B, ER antagonist fulvestrant blocks E2 stimulation of CA12. MCF-7 cells were treated for 8 h with 0.1% ethanol, 10 nmol/L of E2, 1 Amol/L of fulvestrant,

binding to DNA response elements or other protein transcription
factors (24, 28). To examine the role of ER in regulating CA12
mRNA, we used a series of ChIP experiments to investigate the
recruitment and binding of ER to chromatin. Genome-wide ChIPPET experiments using an antibody against ERa to capture DNA
loci bound by ER after 45 minutes of E2 exposure in MCF-7 cells
showed a cluster of ER-binding DNA fragments f6 kb upstream
from the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the CA12 gene (Fig. 3A
and B). Further examination of this ChIP-PET cluster of bound
DNA fragments at f6 kb revealed a cluster of five overlapping
fragments, and two single upstream ChIP-PET DNA fragments
considered to be experimental noise (Fig. 3B; ref. 23).

To validate and further examine the extent of ER binding within
the CA12 genomic region, we performed ChIP scanning for ERa in
MCF-7 cells treated for 45 minutes with vehicle or 10 nmol/L of E2
and amplified recovered ChIP DNA fragments using 100 bp primer
sets tiled approximately every 500 bp from 6.5 kb to the
transcriptional start site of the CA12 gene (Fig. 3C). Of note, within
this region, there are four predicted imperfect EREs and multiple
response elements for factors to which ERa is known to tether
(e.g., activator protein-1), suggesting multiple putative ER-binding
sites. ChIP scanning for ERa binding revealed robust E2-induced
binding approximately at the 6 kb binding region previously shown
to bind ERa through the genomewide ChIP-PET experiments, and

near-background level binding at intervening positions (Fig. 3C).
These ChIP assays further define the one robust ERa-binding
region at a distal region f6 kb upstream from CA12.
E2- and SERM-induced transcription factor recruitment and
chromatin modifications to CA12 genomic regions in vivo. To
better understand the regulation of the CA12 gene, we further
examined the recruitment of ER, coactivators, RNAPII, and
permissive histone modifications at the enhancer, proximal
promoter, and additional loci in MCF-7 cells treated with vehicle,
10 nmol/L of E2, or 100 nmol/L of trans-hydroxytamoxifen. ChIP
experiments coupled with quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)PCR showed specific and robust recruitment of both E2- and
trans-hydroxytamoxifen–bound ERa at the enhancer region after
45 minutes, with minimal binding to a region upstream of the
enhancer or to an intermediate position (Fig. 4, middle) at
approximately 4 kb. The binding of ER to the enhancer region
in E2- or trans-hydroxytamoxifen–treated cells remained elevated

over the vehicle at 4 and 24 hours of exposure. At the proximal
promoter (TSS), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was
bound to a certain degree in the absence of hormone, but increased
7-fold after 45 minutes of E2, consistent with a well-established role
of E2-mediated formation of productive transcriptional complexes.
Consistent with the lower potency of trans-hydroxytamoxifen in
the stimulation of CA12 gene expression, trans-hydroxytamoxifen–
treated cells showed less RNAPII recruitment at the TSS. RNAPII
was not appreciably recruited to areas upstream of the TSS with
either E2 or trans-hydroxytamoxifen treatments.
We also examined the recruitment of both of the coregulators
SRC-2 and SRC-3 to the enhancer region in the presence of E2
(Fig. 4), and found a large change in the recruitment of both at
45 minutes, and also at the 4- and 24-hour time periods monitored.
In the presence of trans-hydroxytamoxifen, coactivator recruitment
at the enhancer was comparable with that of vehicle, suggesting
that the trans-hydroxytamoxifen–bound ER does not efficiently
recruit p160 coregulators, as others have observed (29). To

(E2 > trans-hydroxytamoxifen), which was greatest at 45 minutes
and decreased at later times. This E2- and SERM-mediated increase

in AcH4 was noted at the TSS and also, interestingly, at the middle
and particularly at the upstream regions shown not to bind ER.
These are supportive of findings by others showing a high level of
histone lysine acetylation, consistent with chromatin remodeling,
at the active enhancer and promoter of stimulated genes (30), as
well as more broadly in nearby regions.
Estrogen regulation of the cloned CA12 enhancer is
mediated by an imperfect ERE. The in vivo recruitment of
agonist-bound ERa and coactivator proteins, and histone modifications associated with transactivation, suggest that the identified region f6 kb upstream of the TSS is an enhancer for the CA12
gene. Sequence analysis of putative transcription factor–binding
sites revealed one imperfect ERE with a 1 bp mismatch at
approximately 6047 (relative to TSS; Fig. 5A). To understand the
cis elements involved in recruiting ERa and facilitating transactivation of CA12, we cloned the f6.9 kb fragment of genomic
DNA containing the putative upstream enhancer spanning a region
approximating the captured DNA fragments binding ERa (ChIPPET experiments; Fig. 3B) to just upstream of the CA12 TSS (6832
to +46, Chr15:61461083-61467960). In addition, we also cloned a
truncated 1.8 kb fragment approximating the overlapping ChIPPET cluster of ERa-binding fragments (6832 to 4999), and both
full-length (6832 to +46) and truncated (6832 to 4999)
genomic fragments were then subcloned into luciferase reporter

vectors to assay putative estrogen responsiveness (Fig. 5A). After
transfection into MCF-7 cells and exposure to 10 nmol/L of E2 for
16 hours, the full-length reporter was stimulated approximately
eight times over vehicle-treated transfectants or empty vector
(Fig. 5B). In addition, the truncated reporter approximating the
greatest overlap of ChIP-PET fragments (6832 to 4999) was able
to stimulate reporter activity upon treatment with E2 comparable
to that of the full-length reporter (6832 to +46; Fig. 5B), implying
that the E2-responsive region is located in the far-upstream
genomic region.
As noted above, the ER-binding region at approximately 6 kb
has one imperfect ERE (Fig. 5A), which seemed a likely putative
cis-regulatory element to direct ERa-dependent transactivation.
To examine this, we mutated both the single consensus half-ERE
(Mut. 1.0), or both the consensus half-ERE and imperfect arm of
the ERE (Mut. 1.1). As seen in Fig. 5A and B, mutation of either one
or both arms of the ERE abolished the ability of E2 to stimulate
the 6832 to 4999 reporter, strongly suggesting that ER regulation
of the cloned CA12 enhancer is dependent on an imperfect
(1 mismatch) ERE at 6047 relative to the TSS.
The ER-binding distal enhancer communicates with the
transcriptional start site of the CA12 gene via intrachromosomal looping upon estrogen treatment in vivo. The observed
in vivo recruitment of E2-bound ER to a putative distal enhancer

region, and the E2- and ERE-dependent activation of the cloned
ER-binding enhancer in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells
together suggest that the E2-mediated stimulation of CA12 is via
an ER-dependent upstream enhancer f6 kb upstream from the
CA12 gene. To test the in vivo utilization of this enhancer, we used
chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays to examine the
putative communication of the 6 kb enhancer and the CA12
proximal promoter. Briefly, after 45 minutes of E2 treatment at
10 nmol/L, MCF-7 cells were fixed with formaldehyde and
chromatin was isolated, digested with MseI, and subjected to
dilute intramolecular ligation before de–cross-linking, DNA isolation, and PCR amplification of DNA fragments of interest.
Chromatin regions which were in close proximity with each other
at the time of fixation were examined using PCR primers
complementary to genomic DNA from the enhancer or proximal
promoter regions. Specifically, primers were used in variable
combinations to examine the presence of enhancer DNA only,
proximal promoter DNA only, or all possible DNA species only
produced by intramolecular ligation of DNA derived from the
respective enhancer and promoter regions after fixation and
digestion (Fig. 6, top).
As shown in Fig. 6A (middle), we observed a ligase- and E2dependent 780 PCR product amplified using the ‘‘A’’ forward
primer from the enhancer region and ‘‘F’’ reverse primer from the
proximal promoter region of CA12 (Fig. 6A and B). Normally
separated by f6 kb, the DNA amplified in the resulting PCR
fragment was purified, sequenced, and mapped via BLAT to the
UCSC Human Genome Browser, and resulting sequence analysis
indicated that the E2- and ligase-dependent product was derived
from both CA12 enhancer and promoter regions (Fig. 6A,
bottom). The estrogen-enhanced communication of the distal
enhancer and proximal promoter in the 3C assay strongly
suggests that this ER-binding enhancer is functionally active
in vivo. Taken together with the ChIP assays in which we did not
observe appreciable in vivo recruitment of ERa or RNAPII in the
intervening regions between the ER-binding enhancer and
RNAPII-binding promoter, these 3C data suggest that the ERbinding enhancer transactivates the CA12 gene via intrachromosomal looping.
Conservation of the CA12 enhancer in mammalian genomes
and of CA12 regulation by estrogen receptor. Analysis of the
upstream region of CA12 by Vertebrate Multiz Alignment reveals
a high degree of multispecies conservation within the newly
described ERE-containing enhancer region (Fig. 6B). Within the
enhancer region (Fig. 6B), there is only a 1-bp mismatch between
the human and mouse 15mer ERE. To determine whether there is
estrogen regulation of Car12, the mouse orthologue of the CA12
gene, ovariectomized female mice were treated with E2 or vehicle,
and uteri were collected at 4 or 24 hours postinjection (Fig. 6C).
At both time points examined, Car12 gene expression was robustly
stimulated by E2. These results provide strong evidence that the ER
regulation of CA12 is both mechanistically and evolutionarily
conserved.

Discussion
Our studies reveal that the ER robustly up-regulates CA12 gene
expression in breast cancer cells and that this transcriptional
regulation is mediated by a hormone-responsive enhancer located
f6 kb upstream of the start site of transcription of the CA12 gene.
This marked regulation of CA12 by the ER may account for the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

strong coexpression of ER and CA12 that is observed in breast
tumors.
Dynamic signal-specific assembly of transcription factors at
enhancers is an increasingly recognized aspect of biological control
of genes essential for developmental and hormonal response
programs. Recent studies have suggested that the majority of
estrogen-responsive genes may be under the control of ER-binding
sites at a considerable distance (>5 kb) from the target RNA-coding
loci (23, 31, 32), but there has been only limited evidence that they
function as genomic regulatory elements for these relatively distant
hormone-regulated genes. Here, we describe the regulation of the
carbonic anhydrase XII (CA12) gene by agonist-bound ER through a
long-range distal enhancer that we have characterized through
in vivo ChIP-scanning across the CA12 genomic region and ChIPPET analysis, and by the ability of this element to strongly activate
hormone-dependent expression of a reporter. This enhancer
contains an imperfect ERE which we show to be essential for its
ER regulation through mutagenesis and transfection studies. 3C
and ChIP assays show a physical interaction between this distal
enhancer and the CA12 promoter in breast cancer cells upon E2
treatment, indicating a direct role for the enhancer in CA12
expression.
Associated with the recruitment of ligand-occupied ER to
hormone-dependent enhancers is the recruitment of coregulators
(2, 33, 34), some with histone acetyl transferase activity, resulting in
distinct changes in histone acetylation status and chromatin
conformational changes. In the case of CA12 gene regulation, we
observed markedly increased recruitment to the enhancer of
the p160 coregulators, SRC2 and SRC3 that have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Of note, increased histone H4 acetylation
status was observed not only at the enhancer and promoter regions,
but also broadly throughout the upstream 5¶-flanking region
from the promoter to the enhancer, and even at a more upstream
region, suggesting that chromatin changes are affected over a broad
region after receptor occupancy by ligand. As expected, RNA
polymerase recruitment was only observed at the promoter.
SERMs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, shown to be effective
in both the prevention and treatment of breast cancer (35, 36),
often have mixed agonist-antagonist activities on estrogenregulated genes in breast cancer (26, 37, 38). Tamoxifen was a
weak stimulator of CA12 RNA and protein expression compared
with E2. In keeping with this, tamoxifen was less effective in
increasing the recruitment of ER to the enhancer, in recruiting RNA
polymerase II to the CA12 promoter, and in augmenting the
acetylation of histone H4. As observed previously for estrogenregulated gene expression by SERMs (29), tamoxifen did not recruit
the SRC coregulators, suggesting that other coregulators are likely
involved in eliciting the weak agonistic activity of tamoxifen on
this gene.
Interestingly, the distal enhancer element displays synteny with
the homologous mouse genomic sequence, and its robust
stimulation by E2 in the mouse uterus highlights that ER regulation
of CA12 is mechanistically and evolutionarily conserved. Other
approaches, including bioinformatic coupled with genome-wide
nuclear receptor–binding site analyses, have suggested the likely
conservation of gene-regulatory mechanisms at other estrogenresponsive genes across mammalian species (23, 32).
Gene regulation by long distance enhancers has recently been
observed for other nuclear receptors, such as the androgen
receptor in its control of the prostate-specific antigen gene (39).
Also, recent reports have documented long distance enhancer

regulation of GREB1 (gene regulated in breast cancer-1), encoding
a protein with an unknown function but suggested to contribute to
the enhancement of proliferation of MCF-7 cells by E2 (40, 41). In
the case of GREB1, its stimulation by E2 is mediated by the binding
of ER to three consensus EREs spread over f20 kb of upstream
flanking sequences (41, 42).
CA12 is a membrane zinc metalloenzyme that is present in a
variety of normal tissues but is overexpressed in some cancers
(13, 20, 21, 43–47). In MCF-7 cells, we find that CA12 and CA9 are
the only carbonic anhydrases that are expressed (D.H. Barnett and
B.S. Katzenellenbogen, data not shown). CA12 and CA9 mRNA and
protein levels are stimulated by hypoxia in a variety of cancer cell
lines, and their expression is down-regulated by a return to
normoxia (13, 17, 47, 48). Of note, however, we find that only CA12,
and not CA9, is regulated by estrogen, and likewise, only CA12, and
not CA9, exhibits a strong positive correlation with ER expression
in breast tumors (4, 19). The activity of CA12 as a metalloenzyme,
catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to form
bicarbonate, is likely involved in modulating a variety of
physiologic processes including transport of carbon dioxide and
other solutes, as well as acidification of microenvironments that
can modulate the tumor malignant phenotype (16, 49, 50). That
CA12 expression in breast tumors is associated with lower grade
disease, positive ERa status, and lower relapse rates and better
overall patient survival (20–22) suggests that the estrogen receptor
regulation of CA12 expression may be an important variable in this
more optimal breast tumor phenotype.
Gene expression microarray profiling has documented ERa as a
master transcriptional regulator of the phenotype and behavior of

f70% of human breast cancers, and that the gene expression
signatures in ERa-positive and ERa-negative breast tumors are
profoundly different (5–7, 19). CA12 is one of the genes whose
expression is most highly correlated with ERa in breast cancer.
In fact, for comparison with the correlations shown in Fig. 2D for
CA12 and ERa, we examined the association of ERa with
progesterone receptor, a well-characterized ER target gene and
useful clinical marker, in the same three studies of primary breast
cancer gene expression. Interestingly, the correlation of progesterone receptor with ER in the studies by van de Vijer (0.296), Miller
(0.287), and Wang (0.374) was considerably less than the correlation
of CA12 with ER in the same data sets (Fig. 2D), highlighting the
robust association of CA12 and ER expression. Our findings reveal a
transcriptional regulatory mechanism that likely underlies this
robust coexpression of CA12 and ERa in human breast cancers. In
addition, our findings imply that involvement of long distance
enhancers in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes in breast
cancer may be more frequent than previously appreciated.
