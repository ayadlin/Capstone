Abstract

Author Manuscript

As the concentrations of highly consumed nutrients, particularly glucose, are generally lower in
tumours than in normal tissues1,2, cancer cells must adapt their metabolism to the tumour
microenvironment. A better understanding of these adaptations might reveal cancer cell liabilities
that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. Here, we developed a continuous flow culture
apparatus (Nutrostat) for maintaining proliferating cells in low nutrient media for long periods of
time and used it to undertake competitive proliferation assays on a pooled collection of barcoded
cancer cell lines cultured in low glucose conditions. Sensitivity to low glucose varies amongst cell
lines, and an RNAi screen pinpointed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as the
major pathway required for optimal proliferation in low glucose. We found that cell lines most
sensitive to low glucose are defective in the upregulation of OXPHOS normally caused by glucose
limitation as a result of either mtDNA mutations in Complex I genes or impaired glucose
utilization. These defects predict sensitivity to biguanides, anti-diabetic drugs that inhibit
OXPHOS3,4, when cancer cells are grown in low glucose or as tumour xenografts. Remarkably,

the biguanide sensitivity of cancer cells with mtDNA mutations was reversed by ectopic
expression of yeast NDI1, a ubiquinone oxidoreductase that allows bypass of Complex I function5.
Thus, we conclude that mtDNA mutations and impaired glucose utilization are potential
biomarkers for identifying tumours with increased sensitivity to OXPHOS inhibitors.

As nutrient concentrations in tumours are different than in normal tissues, cancer cells in
vivo may have metabolic dependencies that are not shared by normal cells6. In particular,
tumour glucose concentrations are frequently 3-10 fold lower than in non-transformed
tissues1,7, likely as a result of the high rate of glucose consumption by cancer cells and the
poor tumour vasculature. To study the metabolic dependencies imposed on cancer cells by a
chronically low glucose environment, we developed a continuous flow culture system for
maintaining proliferating cells in reduced but steady glucose concentrations for long periods
of time. In this system, which we call a Nutrostat, media of a defined glucose concentration
is fed into a suspension culture while spent media is removed at the same rate (Fig. 1a). By
measuring cell proliferation and glucose concentrations, glucose consumption can be
predicted and glucose levels in the intake media adjusted so that culture glucose
concentrations remain within a 0.5 mM window (Fig. 1b). Jurkat leukemia cells seeded into
1 mM glucose media in a traditional culture vessel rapidly ceased proliferating as glucose
became exhausted (Extended Data Fig. 2). In contrast, in a Nutrostat maintained at ~0.75
mM glucose, Jurkat cells proliferated exponentially at a rate that was only slightly less than
in ~10 mM glucose (doubling time of 26 versus 24 hours, Fig. 1b). Despite having a small
effect on Jurkat cell proliferation, long term culture in low glucose caused profound
metabolic changes: rates of glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP levels
decreased as did levels of intermediates in the upper glycolysis and pentose-phosphate
pathways (Fig. 1c, d).

To determine if all cancer cells respond similarly to long term low glucose culture we
undertook a competitive proliferation assay with a pooled collection of 28 patient-derived
cancer cell lines, each marked with a lentivirally transduced DNA barcode (Fig. 2a). All cell
lines were capable of proliferating in suspension and many were derived from blood cancers
but also from breast, lung, stomach, and colon cancers. The relative abundance of each cell
line at the initial seeding and after three weeks in culture at 0.75 or 10 mM glucose was
determined by deep sequencing of the barcodes, and the change in doubling time calculated
for each cell line (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, cancer cell lines exhibit
diverse responses to glucose limitation, as the proliferation of many was unaffected, whereas
that of a subset was strongly reduced and another, surprisingly, increased (Fig. 2b). The
presence or absence of known oncogenic mutations did not correlate with differences in low
glucose sensitivity.
To understand the metabolic processes that mediate the response to glucose limitation, we
used a cell line of modest glucose sensitivity (Jurkat) to undertake a pooled RNAi screen of
2,752 human metabolic enzymes and small molecule transporters (15,997 total shRNAs;
5-10 shRNAs per gene) in high or low glucose media in Nutrostats (Fig. 2c). For control
shRNAs and the great majority of gene-targeting shRNAs, the average fold change in
shRNA abundance was similar in both conditions (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table 2).

However, 10.5% of shRNAs were differentially depleted and, based on our hit criteria (see
methods8), we identified 28 and 36 genes whose suppression preferentially inhibited cell
proliferation in high or low glucose, respectively (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Table 3 and
Extended Data Fig. 3a). Genes selectively required in 10 mM glucose fell into several
pathways but were enriched for glycolytic genes (GAPDH, ALDOA, PKM, ENO1; p < 8.6 ×
10-7). In striking contrast, genes selectively required under 0.75 mM glucose consisted
almost exclusively of the nuclear-encoded components of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS, Fig. 2e). Amongst the scoring genes were six of the seven
nuclear-encoded core Complex I subunits conserved between mammals and bacteria9, a
significant enrichment compared to non-core subunits (p < 0.0012, Extended Data Fig. 3b).
Two genes required for OXPHOS function, ACAD9 and PISD9,10, also scored, as did
SLC2A1, the gene encoding the GLUT1 glucose transporter. Short-term individual assays
validated that efficient suppression of top scoring OXPHOS genes selectively decreased
proliferation under low glucose, while hairpins targeting non-scoring OXPHOS genes did so
to a significantly lesser extent (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3c). Thus, a screen of
metabolic genes pinpointed OXPHOS as the key metabolic process required for optimal
proliferation of cancer cells under glucose limitation.

Given these very clear results it seemed likely that fundamental differences in mitochondrial
function exist between cancer cell lines that are most sensitive (U-937, MC116, NCI-H929,
KMS-26) and resistant (Raji, NCI-H82, NCI-H524, SNU-16, NCI-H2171) to glucose
limitation. However, we did not detect any differences in mitochondrial DNA content,
mitochondrial mass, and baseline oxygen consumption rate (OCR, Extended Data Fig. 4a,b).
Therefore, we considered whether a key difference is in the mitochondrial response to
glucose limitation, which reversibly induces oxygen consumption11 (Extended Data Fig.
4c). Indeed, when cultured in low glucose media, the low glucose sensitive cell lines
upregulated OCR less than the resistant ones (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, in response to the
mitochondrial uncoupling agent FCCP, low glucose sensitive cell lines induced OCR to a
lesser extent than resistant lines, indicating they have reduced spare respiratory capacities
(Fig. 3b).

Author Manuscript

We considered two explanations for why low glucose sensitive lines do not substantially
increase oxygen consumption upon glucose limitation: (1) a defect in glucose utilization that
limits substrates for mitochondria, or (2) a defect in OXPHOS itself. Consistent with the
first possibility, glucose consumption (Fig. 3c) and import (Extended Data Fig. 4d) under
low glucose conditions were defective in two (NCI-H929 and KMS-26) of the low glucose
sensitive cell lines. Analysis of publicly available gene expression data revealed that these
cell lines have low expression of the GLUT3 and GLUT1 glucose transporters, which we
verified by qPCR (Fig. 3d), as well as lower levels of several glycolytic enzymes (Extended
Data Fig. 4e). Using gene expression data for 967 cell lines12 we identified additional lines
with this expression signature and obtained five of them (Extended Data Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Table 4). In low glucose media, the five lines (LP-1, L-363, MOLP-8, D341
Med, KMS-28BM) had the predicted defect in glucose consumption and proliferation, like
NCI-H929 and KMS-26 cells (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8b). In all cell lines tested
(KMS-26, NCI-H929, L-363, LP-1, MOLP-8), GLUT3 over-expression was sufficient to

rescue these phenotypes (Fig. 3f and 3g, Extended Data Fig. 4f), while not substantially
affecting proliferation in high glucose (Extended Data Fig. 4g), arguing that a glucose
utilization defect can account for why the proliferation of certain cancer cells is sensitive to
low glucose. Indeed, in a competitive proliferation assay, over-expression of GLUT3
provides a growth advantage to KMS-26 cells compared to vector infected controls grown
under 0.75-2.0 mM glucose in culture and in tumor xenografts (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Author Manuscript

To investigate if defects in OXPHOS might be a distinct mechanism underlying low glucose
sensitivity, we focused on U-937 cells as they have low basal OCR but normal glucose
utilization (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Indeed, in permeabilized cell mitochondrial
function assays, U-937 cells had a profound defect in utilizing substrates for Complexes I
(pyruvate and malate) and II (succinate), but not Complex IV (TMPD and ascorbate) (Fig.
3h, Extended Data Fig. 4h). Sequencing of the 7 Complex I subunits encoded by the
mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) revealed heteroplasmic truncating mutations in ND1 and
ND5 in U-937 cells (Fig. 3i).

Author Manuscript

We used available cancer genome resequencing data and information from the literature12,13
to identify additional cell lines with mtDNA mutations in Complex I subunits and obtained
five, including two with the same ND5 mutation as U-937 cells (Fig. 3j, Extended Data Fig.
7). Like U-937, the additional lines (BxPC3, Cal-62, HCC-1438, HCC-827, NU-DHL-1)
weakly boosted OCR in low glucose media (Fig. 3k) and had a proliferation defect in this
condition (Extended Data Fig. 8b). To ask if these phenotypes are caused by Complex I
dysfunction, we expressed the S. cerevisiae NDI1 gene, which catalyzes electron transfer
from NADH to ubiquinone without proton translocation5,14. NDI1 expression significantly
increased the basal OCR of the Complex I defective cells (Cal-62, HCC-827, BxPC3,
U-937) and partly rescued their proliferation defect in low glucose, while not substantially
affecting proliferation in high glucose (Extended Data Fig. 4f,i-l). In an alternative
approach, culture of Cal-62 cells for 1.5 months in the presence of a Complex I inhibitor
(phenformin) yielded a population of cells with significantly enriched wild-type mtDNA
content and a corresponding decrease in sensitivity to low glucose, changes not observed in
cells expressing NDI1 (Extended Data Fig. 9). Taken together, these data identify defective
glucose utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction as two distinct mechanisms for conferring
sensitivity to glucose limitation on cancer cell lines.

RNAi-mediated suppression of OXPHOS exacerbated the modest sensitivity of Jurkat cells
to low glucose (Fig. 2). Thus, we wondered if low glucose sensitive cells lines might be, like
LKB1-deficient cells15, particularly sensitive to the biguanide class of pharmacological
OXPHOS inhibitors3,4 that includes metformin and the more potent biguanide phenformin3.
Indeed, in low glucose media, cell lines with mtDNA-encoded Complex I mutations (U-937,
BxPC3, Cal-62, HCC-1438, HCC-827, NU-DHL-1) or impaired glucose utilization (NCIH929, KMS-26, LP-1, L-363, MOLP-8, D341 Med, KMS-28BM) were 5-20 fold more
sensitive to phenformin compared to control cancer cell lines or an immortalized B cell line
(Fig. 4a), and similar results were obtained with metformin or when using direct cell
counting as a readout (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b,d). The low glucose sensitive cell lines,
particularly those with impaired glucose utilization, tended to be more sensitive to
phenformin in 0.75 than 10 mM glucose, but substantial sensitivity persisted at 1.5-3.0 mM

glucose (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8c,e). Importantly, in cells with impaired glucose
utilization, GLUT3 over-expression almost completely rescued the phenformin sensitivity
specific to the low glucose condition, such that GLUT3-expressing cells in 0.75 mM glucose
and control cells in 10 mM glucose were similarly affected by phenformin (Fig. 4c).
Likewise, in cells with mutations in Complex I, NDI1 expression almost completely rescued
the effects of phenformin on proliferation (Fig. 4d) and oxygen consumption (Fig. 4e,
Extended Data Fig. 8g). Phenformin sensitivity is restricted to cells with the intermediate
levels of mitochondrial dysfunction typically seen in cancer cells, as cells lacking mtDNA
(143B Rho) are insensitive to phenformin but sensitive to low glucose (Extended Data Fig.
8h).

Author Manuscript

Consistent with these findings and with the low glucose environment of tumors1,2,7,
phenformin inhibited the growth of mouse tumour xenografts derived from cancer cells with
mtDNA mutations (Cal-62, BxPC3, U-937) or poor glucose consumption (KMS-26, NCIH929), but not from cells lacking these defects (NCI-H2171 and NCI-H82) (Fig. 4f, g). The
effects of phenformin on tumour xenograft growth were rescued in mtDNA mutant cells by
the introduction of NDI1, and in KMS-26 cells by the over-expression of GLUT3 (Fig. 4g,
Extended Data Fig. 8f), demonstrating that the effect of phenformin on these xenografts has
a cell autonomous component. Thus, the glucose utilization gene signature described earlier
and mutations in mtDNA-encoded Complex I subunits may serve as biomarkers for
identifying tumours that are particularly sensitive to phenformin treatment. Such tumours
are likely not infrequent as the prevalence of truncating mutations in mtDNA-encoded
OXPHOS components is reported to be as high as 16%16 and we detect the low glucose
import gene expression signature in at least 5% of cell lines profiled (of which multiple
myeloma and small cell lung cancer are significantly enriched). Interestingly, a number of
retrospective studies report survival benefits for cancer patients taking metformin17,18,
although it has been unclear whether these effects of metformin are cancer cellautonomous15,19,20.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we find that cancer cells exhibit diverse responses to glucose limitation and
identify defects in glucose utilization and mitochondrial function as major determinants of
low glucose sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 1). These biomarkers may pinpoint cancer cells
likely to respond to OXPHOS inhibition alone under tumor-relevant glucose concentrations.
Such a targeted strategy may be better tolerated than previously proposed approaches of
combining inhibition of OXPHOS and glycolysis21-23. Moreover, our findings underscore
the importance of considering glucose concentrations when evaluating the sensitivity of
cancer cells to biguanides or other OXPHOS inhibitors. The methods described here should
be valuable for studying the responses of cancer cells to tumour-relevant concentrations of
other highly consumed nutrients, such as amino acids24, and to additional compounds that
target metabolism.

#97056-526), Tygon tubing (Saint Gobain Performance Plastics, manufacturer number
ACJ00004 (outlet, 3/32” × 5/32”) and ABW00001 (inlet, 1/32” × 3/32”), Outlet filter
(Restek, catalog number 25008), vented caps for source and waste containers (Bio Chem
Fluidics, catalog number 00945T-2F), and outlet tubing check valve (Ark-plas, catalog
number AP19CV0012SL) to prevent backflow. Spinner flasks were siliconized before each
use using Sigmacote (Sigma #SL2) according to the manufacturer’s method, and autoclaved.
Outlet filter was cleaned prior to use by passing phosphate buffered saline and then 70%
ethanol through the filter in both the forward and reverse directions. Plastic tubing was
replaced prior to each experiment and was cut to 50-60cm pieces and threaded through the
caps for the source or waste vessel, over the peristaltic pump, and through the caps on the
spinner flask. The outlet tubing was cut ~5 cm from the spinner flask to allow for the
introduction of the check valve and prevent back-flow of media. Tubing was adjusted to the
following heights: source vessel, bottom; spinner flask inlet, 3 cm from cap (above media
level); spinner flask outlet + filter, empirically adjusted so that the volume of media in the
vessel is maintained at 500mL; waste vessel, 2 cm from the cap. The entire assembled setup
was autoclaved prior to use. Flow rate of the inlet peristaltic pump was adjusted empirically
to 100 mL per day using phosphate buffered saline before the introduction of culture media,
and the flow rate of the waste pump was set to safely exceed 100mL per day to prevent
media accumulation in the vessel. Some escape of cells from the vessel and accumulation in
the waste vessel was normal. Media was sampled directly from the vessel by pipette. The
mass of glucose consumed by the Nutrostat over time was modeled by the following
equation:

Where N0 is the starting cell number, Qglucose is the consumption rate of glucose (g/cell/
day), a is the doubling time of the cell line (days), and t is time (days). The values for N0,
Qglucose and a were empirically determined before the start of the experiment. The Nutrostat
glucose consumption was calculated in hourly increments and balanced by the amount of
glucose leaving or entering the chamber such that Gnutrostat over the one hour time interval =
([Gluc]source * Vin) - ([Gluc]nutrostat * Vout) where [Gluc]nutrostat is the Nutrostat glucose
concentration, [Gluc]source is the source media glucose concentration, Vout is the volume of
media leaving the chamber, and Vin is the volume of media entering the chamber (Vout = Vin
= 0.1 L/day). The [Gluc]source was adjusted daily so that the [Gluc]nutrostat predicted by the
model remained between the desired glucose concentration boundaries, and adherence of the
actual glucose concentration in the Nutrostat to the model was periodically evaluated by
measuring the glucose concentration of media samples using a glucose oxidase assay (Fisher
Scientific, catalog number TR-15221).

control shRNAs were obtained and combined to generate a single plasmid pool, the
composition of which is described in Supplementary Table 2. Plasmid pools were used to
generate lentivirus-containing supernatants and target cell lines were infected in 2ug/mL
polybrene as described25. Specifically, the titer of lentiviral supernatants was determined by
infecting targets cells at several concentrations, counting the number of drug resistant
infected cells after 3 days of selection. 30 million target cells were infected at an MOI of
~0.5 to ensure that most cells contained only a single viral integrant and ensure proper
library complexity. Infected cells were selected with 0.5 ug/mL puromycin for 3 days. Cells
containing shRNA pools were used to inoculate Nutrostats at ~15M cells per 500mL culture.
Glucose concentrations were measured daily and adjusted as described above. Cultures were
split back once to maintain a cell density of less than 500K cells/mL. Cultures were
harvested for genomic DNA extraction after ~15 population doublings, and samples were
processed as described25 except that two rounds of PCR were used and the primers used to
amplify shRNA inserts and perform deep sequencing (Illumina) are as provided below.
shRNAs present at fewer than 100 reads in the initial post-infection sample were eliminated
from further analysis. Because the lentiviral pool contained shRNA expression vectors
pLKO.1 and pLKO.005, to eliminate any backbone-specific amplification bias, the
abundance measurements of shRNAs in the pLKO.005 vector were normalized such that the
distribution of shRNA abundances in the pLKO.005 vector matched the distribution of
shRNA abundances in the pLKO.1 vector in each sample. Individual shRNAs were
identified as differentially scoring in high glucose versus low glucose using a Log2 fold
change cutoff of −0.75 (high glucose versus low glucose). For each comparison, genes were
considered hits if >33% of the shRNAs targeting that gene scored when averaging across all
replicates (“% shRNAs scoring” reported in Fig. 2e). Pathways scoring as preferentially
required in low glucose are Complex I (p < 9.3 × 10−49), III (p < 6.6 × 10−20), IV (p < 8.3 ×
10−10) and V (p < 5.6 × 10−19). The top 1-2 genes scoring by “% shRNAs scoring” from
Complex I, III and IV were chosen for validation and are reported in Fig. 2f (Complex I
genes NDUFV1 and NDUFA11, and Complex III genes CYC1 and UQCRC1) and
Extended Data Fig. 3 (Complex IV gene COX5A). Complex I was followed up going
forward in Fig. 3i-k and Fig. 4 using a specific inhibitor (phenformin) since this was the
most significantly scoring pathway and because mutations were identified in
mitochondrially encoded Complex I subunits in several cell lines, and a high prevalence of
somatic mutations in mtDNA encoded Complex I genes have been reported previously in
human tumors. Alternative methods for identifying hits from RNAi based screens were
employed using the GENE-E program8 (Broad Institute) and the results are reported in
Supplementary Table 3. These alternative methods all identify highly significant numbers of
Complex I, III, IV and V genes as being differentially essential in 0.75 mM glucose.

Cell Barcoding
To mark individual cell lines with DNA barcodes, a unique seven base pair sequence was
transduced into cells using lentiviruses produced from a pLKO.1P vector into which the
following sequence was cloned utilizing the following primers, which had been annealed
and ligated to an AgeI and EcoRI restriction enzyme cut vector:

The sequence of individual lentiviral vectors was determined by Sanger sequencing and
vectors containing unique sequences were chosen for transduction into cell lines. Each cell
line was infected with three barcodes in separate infections so that the proliferation of each
cell line could be measured three times independently in a single experiment. Proliferation
assays of the individually barcoded cell lines verified that the barcodes did not affect cell
proliferation in short term assays. To perform the cell competition assays, all of the
barcoded cell lines were mixed in equal proportion with bias for slower proliferating cell
lines being over-represented in the initial population. The Nutrostats were inoculated with
5M pooled cells at 10 mM or 0.75 mM glucose concentrations and the proliferation and
glucose consumption of the culture carefully monitored to adjust for any time dependent
changes in the per cell glucose consumption rate. After 15 population doublings, cells were
harvested for genomic DNA isolation and processed for deep sequencing as described
above. Barcode abundance was determined in the starting population or after 15 population
doublings, and the fold change in barcode abundance relative to the abundance of Jurkat cell
line barcodes was calculated. Based on the number of population doublings of the entire
culture and the known doubling time of the Jurkat cell line, the doubling time (hours) of
each cell line in the mixture was calculated according to the following formula:

Where 293 hours is the duration of the experiment, Log2 FCcell line is the Log2 Fold change
in abundance of barcode for the given cell line in the final sample compared to the initial,
Log2 FCJurkat is the Log2 fold change for the Jurkat cell line, and PDJurkat is the empirically
determined number of population doublings that the Jurkat cell line underwent during 293
hours (i.e. 12.2 doublings in 10 mM glucose and 11.3 doublings in 0.75 mM glucose
conditions). These calculated doubling times are reported for each barcode replicate in
Supplementary Table 1.
Glucose Consumption and Uptake

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in 10 mM or 0.75 mM glucose media at 5-20K cells per mL in 24 well
plates in 1 mL media in replicates of four. Media was harvested after four days of culture
and the number of cells counted. Harvested media was assayed by a glucose oxidase assay
and the absorbance at 500 nm determined of assay buffer plus spent media, media from
control wells containing no cells, or media containing no glucose, allowing the
concentration of glucose in the spent media to be calculated according to Beer’s Law. The
mass of glucose consumed was normalized to the average number of cells present in the
well, which was calculated by integrating the number of cells present during the course of
the experiment over four days assuming simple exponential growth of the cells during the
course of the experiment from the measured starting to final number of cells. For glucose
import, cells were incubated in 0.75 mM glucose media overnight. The following day,
Tritium-labeled 2-DG (5 μCi/mL, Moravek) in RPMI was added to 300,000 cells in fresh
0.75 mM glucose media. The import was stopped after 30, 60 and 120 min by the addition
of cold HBSS containing the Glucose transporter inhibitor Cytochalasin B. The cells were
next washed once with ice-cold HBSS and lysed in 400 μl RIPA buffer with 1% SDS.
Radioactive counts were determined by a scintillation counter and scintillation reads were
normalized to the total protein concentration of each sample.
Metabolite Profiling
For metabolite concentration measurements, 10 million Jurkat cells were cultured in
Nutrostats for 2 weeks before metabolite extraction. Cells were rapidly washed three times
with cold PBS, and metabolites were extracted by the addition of 80% ice-cold methanol.
Endogenous metabolite profiles were obtained using LC-MS as described 26. Metabolite
levels (n = 3 biological replicates) were normalized to cell number.

Author Manuscript

Lactate and NAD(H) measurements
Lactate was measured as previously described25 using the same medium that was used for
glucose consumption measurements (above). NAD(H) was measured using the Fluoro NAD
kit (Cell Technology FLNADH 100-2) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Bioinformatic identification of cell lines with impaired glucose utilization

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Gene expression data for all glycolytic genes and glucose transporters was compared
between glucose utilization deficient cell lines (KMS-26 and NCI-H929) and all of the other
cell lines, and those genes whose expression was significantly lower in the glucose
utilization deficient lines were selected (SLC2A1, HK1, GAPDH, ENO1, GPI, TPI1, and
PKM). SLC2A3 was also included as its expression was found to be significantly altered
using qPCR (Figure 3d). Log2 transformed expression data for these eight genes was
extracted for all 967 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. For each cell line,
we computed the difference between the expression level of each gene and the median
expression level in all cell lines. These values were summed across all eight genes, and the
cell lines were ranked in order of gene expression from lowest to highest (Supplementary
Table 4). Those cell lines included KMS-26 and NCI-H929, and from the other thirty cell
lines with the lowest expression level of these genes, readily available lines were chosen.
Identification of cell lines with mutations in mtDNA encoded Complex I subunits

Author Manuscript

Hybrid capture genome resequencing data of 912 cell lines from the Broad Institute Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (data kindly provided by Dr. Levi Garraway (DFCI/Broad)) were
mined for spurious mtDNA reads, which were aligned to the Revised Cambridge Reference
Sequence. Sufficient data were obtained to reach an average of 5x coverage in 504 cell lines.
Cell lines with frameshifting insertions or deletions in Complex I subunits were identified
from the data, and the presence of the predicted mutations confirmed by Sanger sequencing
using the primers listed below in PCR followed by sequencing reactions. The degree of
heteroplasmy was estimated based upon the ratio of the area under the curves of the wild
type allele to the mutant allele from Sanger sequence traces. Common variants were
identified and filtered out by comparison to a database of such variants (MITOMAP:
www.mitomap.org) and by the presence of these variants in >1% of the other cell lines in
the CCLE set.

Cell Proliferation Assays—Cell Counting

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in triplicate in 24 well plates at 5-20 thousand cells per well in 2 mL
RPMI base media under the conditions described in each experiment (i.e. varying glucose
concentration or phenformin treatment). After four days, the entire contents of the well was
resuspended and counted (suspension cells) or trypsinized, resuspended and counted
(adherent cells) using a Beckman Z2 Coulter Counter with a size selection setting of 8-30
um. The increase in cell number compared to the initially plated sample was calculated and
all values were normalized to their control in 10mM glucose unless otherwise indicated.
Cell Proliferation Assays—ATP-Based Measurements

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in replicates of five in 96 well plates at 0.5-1 thousand cells per well in
200 uL RPMI base media under the conditions described in each experiment, and a separate
group of 5 wells was also plated for each cell line with no treatment for an initial time point.
After 5 hours (untreated cells for initial time point) or after 3 days (with varying treatment
conditions), 40 uL of Cell Titer Glo reagent (Promega) was added to each well, mixed
briefly, and the luminescence read on a Luminometer (Molecular Devices). For wells with
treatments causing an increase in luminescence, the fold change in luminescence relative to
the initial luminescence was computed and this fold change for each condition was
normalized to untreated wells (no effect = 1). For wells with treatments causing a decrease
in luminescence, the fold decrease in luminescence relative to the initial luminescence was
computed (no viable cells present = -1).
Real Time qPCR

Author Manuscript

RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA was spectrophotometrically quantified and equal amounts were used for cDNA
synthesis with the Superscript II RT Kit (Invitrogen). To isolate genomic and mitochondrial
DNA we used the Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR or qPCR analysis of gene
expression or copy number was performed on a ABI Real Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) with the SYBR green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems).
All primers were designed using the Primer3 software and aligned to the human reference
genomes using blast to verify their specificity. The primers used for GLUT3 and GLUT1 are
as follows GLUT1_F/R: tcgtcggcatcctcatcgcc/ccggttctcctcgttgcggt; GLUT3_F/R:
ttgctcttcccctccgctgc/accgtgtgcctgcccttcaa. Results were normalized to RPL0 levels.
Oxygen Consumption

Author Manuscript

Oxygen consumption of intact or permeabilized cells was measured using an XF24
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). For suspension cells, seahorse plates
were coated with Cell TAK (BD, 0.02 mg/ml in 0.1 μM NaHO3) for 20 minutes to increase
adherence of suspension cells. 250,000 cells then were attached to the plate by
centrifugation at 2200 rpm without brakes for 5 min. For adherent cells, 40,000 to 80,000
cells were plated the night before the experiments. RPMI 8226 (US biological #9011) was
used as the assay media for all experiments with the indicated glucose concentrations in the
presence of 2 mM Glutamine without serum. For spare respiratory capacity measurements,
increasing FCCP concentrations (0.1, 0.5 and 2 uM) were used in order to assess maximum

OCR of each cell line. For basal oxygen consumption measurements, cell number or protein
concentration was used for normalization.

Author Manuscript

Permeabilized cell measurements were performed as described previously27. Briefly, cells
were re-suspended and plated cells (300,000 cells in 500 μl per well) in MAS-1 buffer (70
mM Sucrose, 220 mM Mannitol, 10 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM HEPES, 1 mM
EGTA, 0.2% FA free BSA, pH 7.2). Saponin (50 μg/ml), methyl pyruvate/malate (10 mM/5
mM) for functional assessment of complex I, Succinate (5mM) /Rotenone (0.5uM) and
Antimycin (1uM) for functional assessment of complex II and III, TMPD/Ascorbate
(10mM/50mM) for functional assessment of complex IV, and 4 mM ADP was added to
permeabilized cells to activate respiration in the mitochondria. We used the complex V
inhibitor oligomycin (0.5 μM) to measure oxygen consumption in the absence of oxidative
phosphorylation. All compounds were diluted in the assay buffer and injected into the wells
sequentially as indicated for each experiment.
Mouse Xenografts

Author Manuscript

Xenografts were initiated with 2-5 million cells per injection site implanted subcutaneously
into the right and left flanks of 5-8 week old male NOD.CB17 Scid/J mice (Jackson Labs).
Once tumours were palpable in all animals (>50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements),
mice were assigned randomly into biguanide treated or untreated groups and caliper
measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumour burden approached the limits set by
institutional guidelines. Tumour volume was assessed according to the formula ½*W*W*L
or 4/3*3.14*W/2*L/2*D/2 for large tumors. Phenformin was delivered in drinking water as
described previously15 at 1.7 mg/ml concentration with 5 mg/ml sucralose (Splenda), and
metformin was delivered by daily IP injection (300 mg/kg). All experiments involving mice
were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under
supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.
Mitochondrial DNA copy number and mass
For relative mitochondrial mass measurements, 2×105 cells were incubated directly with 50
nM Mitotracker Green FM (Invitrogen M7514) in RPMI for 40 minutes at 37°C. Cells were
then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C and the overlying media removed. Cells
were kept on ice, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 7AAD (Invitrogen A1310) for FACS analysis of live cells. The mean Mitotracker Green
fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of relative mitochondrial mass.

Author Manuscript

For copy number, total DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Minikit and real-time
PCR was used to estimate relative differences in mtDNA copy number between different
cell lines. Alu repeat elements were used as controls. Primers used are:

Selection of cells in Phenformin

Author Manuscript

Cal-62 cells were selected at a concentration of phenformin that permitted half-maximal
growth compared to the unselected line (approximately 5uM for 2 weeks, 10uM for 1.5
weeks, 15uM for 1.5 weeks, and 20uM for 1 week). Cells were split 1:10 when nearing
confluence. After selection, cells were removed from phenformin for at least 3 days before
starting proliferation assays. The ratio of wild type to mutant mtDNA was calculated by
summing the 11 Sanger Sequencing peak height measurements per nucleotide position for
the wild type and mutant allele allowing for the percent mutant calculated. These values
were averaged over three nucleotide positions for which the base in the wild type and mutant
sequence differs.
Cell competition assay for KMS-26 cells with control and GLUT3 vector

Author Manuscript

KMS-26 cells with vector control and GLUT3 overexpression were mixed in equal amounts
and an initial mixed sample was collected. Mixed cells were then cultured in different
glucose concentrations in vitro and additionally injected subcutaneously to NOD-SCID
mice. After 2.5 weeks, genomic DNA was isolated from initial sample, cells cultured in
different glucose concentrations in vitro, and tumors grown in mice. Using a 5′ common
primer targeting the vector (AGTAGACGGCATCGCAGCTTGGATA) and 3′ primers
targeting the vector (GGCGGAATTTACGTAGCGGCC) or GLUT3
(GAGCCGATTGTAGCAACTGTGATGG), the abundance of the integrated viruses were
determined and the relative abundance of KMS-26 Vector and KMS-26 GLUT3 cells
inferred.
Statistics and Animal Model Statements

Author Manuscript

All experiments reported in Figures 1-4 were repeated at least three times in the laboratory,
except Figure 4f and 4g, which were performed once. T-tests were heteroscedastic to allow
for unequal variance and distributions assumed to follow a Student’s t distribution, and these
assumptions are not contradicted by the data. No samples or animals were excluded from
analysis, and sample size estimates were not used. Animals were randomly assigned into a
treatment group with the constraint that the starting tumor burden in the treatment and
control groups were similar. Studies were not conducted blind.

Extended Data Fig. 1. Model of the metabolic determinants of sensitivity to low glucose and
biguanides.

Author Manuscript

This diagram outlines the interplay between reserve oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
capacity, sensitivity to biguanides, and sensitivity to culture in low glucose. Most cancer cell
lines and normal cells tested exhibited an ability to respond to glucose limitation by
upregulating OXPHOS, rendering them less sensitive to biguanides and low glucose
conditions. In contrast, cell lines harboring mutations in mtDNA encoded Complex I
subunits or exhibiting impaired glucose utilization have a limited reserve OXPHOS capacity
and are therefore unable to properly respond to biguanides and low glucose, rendering them
sensitive to these perturbations. At the extreme, cells artificially engineered to have no
OXPHOS (Rho cells) exhibit extreme low glucose sensitivity, but resistance to further
inhibition of OXPHOS. Thus, mtDNA mutant cancer cells exist at an intermediate state of
OXPHOS functionality that renders them sensitive to treatment with biguanides in vitro and
in vivo. Similarly, cell lines with impaired glucose utilization exhibit biguanide sensitivity
specifically under the low glucose conditions seen in the tumor microenvironment.
