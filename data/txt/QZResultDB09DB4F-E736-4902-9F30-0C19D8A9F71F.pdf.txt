Abstract
Chromatin acetylation is attributed with distinct functional relevance with
respect to gene expression in normal and diseased conditions thereby leading to
a topical interest in the concept of epigenetic modulators and therapy. We report
here the identification and characterization of the acetylation inhibitory potential
of an important dietary flavonoid, luteolin. Luteolin was found to inhibit p300
acetyltransferase with competitive binding to the acetyl CoA binding site. Luteolin
treatment in a xenografted tumor model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), led to a dramatic reduction in tumor growth within 4 weeks corresponding
to a decrease in histone acetylation. Cells treated with luteolin exhibit cell cycle
arrest and decreased cell migration. Luteolin treatment led to an alteration in gene
expression and miRNA profile including up-regulation of p53 induced miR-195/215,
let7C; potentially translating into a tumor suppressor function. It also led to downregulation of oncomiRNAs such as miR-135a, thereby reflecting global changes in the
microRNA network. Furthermore, a direct correlation between the inhibition of histone
acetylation and gene expression was established using chromatin immunoprecipitation
on promoters of differentially expressed genes. A network of dysregulated genes
and miRNAs was mapped along with the gene ontology categories, and the effects
of luteolin were observed to be potentially at multiple levels: at the level of gene
expression, miRNA expression and miRNA processing.

is a potent, specific competitive inhibitor of p300
acetyltransferase activity with an IC50 of 7µM. Luteolin
could inhibit histone acetylation in cultured cells and
also in in vivo xenograft mouse model, the growth of
which was retarded upon luteolin treatment. Apart from
the direct effect on histone acetylation in the protein
coding gene promoters resulting in downregulation of
important cytokines like IL6, luteolin treatment also led
to a significant alteration in the expression of miRNAs.
Alteration of miRNA expression levels regulates the
protein coding genes post transcriptionally. Interestingly,
the profile of the upregulated miRNAs clustered towards
tumor suppression, with many miRNAs being known
inducers of cell cyle arrest and negative regulators of cell
migration. The miRNAs with downregulated expression
were predominantly classified into the oncomiR category.
DICER, a component of the miRNA processing machinery
was also found to be differentially expressed, which can
also contribute to changes in miRNA processing. Thus,
the important dietary flavonoid, luteolin was found to
be a p300 acetyltransferase inhibitor, with the ability
to modulate gene expression, miRNA expression and
potentially, miRNA processing, correlating to a tumour
suppressor outcome, which was also reflected in HNSCC
tumor xenograft model.

instability. Hence, there is an active search for better
inhibitors from natural sources as well as for the synthesis
of better molecules. Surprisingly, a vast majority of the
inhibitors have been identified from the natural sources
and based on these scaffolds, efficient molecules have
been synthesized (reviewed in [1] and references thereof).
The first natural and potent acetyltransferase inhibitor
(KATi), anacardic acid was isolated from Cashew Nut
Shell Liquid (CNSL) was found to be poorly permeable
to cells. Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone
from the kokum fruit (Garcinia indica) also found later
on as a potent KATi with a non-specific mode of action,
was subsequently derivatized into LTK14, a p300 specific
KATi with promising therapeutic potential [2]. One of the
most important natural source derived KATi is CTK7A,
a water soluble derivative of curcumin which exhibited
tumour regression ability in oral cancer xenograft model
system [3]. Although these natural source-derived and
modified KATi and several other synthetic KATi such
as lysyl CoA [4] and C646 [5] have shown tremendous
potential in several preclinical studies, most of these are
limited by their working concentrations or their apparent
difficulties to be metabolized. All these shortcomings have
resulted in an ongoing effort to identify better and efficient
molecules with improved therapeutic index.
During one such screening process, we had earlier
identified that the crude extract of pomegranate fruit rind
had a potent p300 acetyltransferase inhibitory activity.
The subsequent purification of this extract had led to
the identification of another active component which
incidentally was an inhibitor of arginine methyltransferase
[6], which was later used as a tool to understand the role
of PRMT4 in neural/glial differentiation [7]. However,
to find the potential new inhibitor in the crude extract, we
decided to assay with the known components of the crude
extract. Incidentally, majority of them were flavonoids,
an important dietary constituent found in several edible
fruits and vegetables. Flavonoids have been attributed
with antioxidant property, potential to slow ageing,
protection against cardiac diseases, ability to lower the
risk of diabetes, cancer, stroke and also neurodegenerative
disorders
like
dementia,
Alzheimers’
and
Parkinsons’[8-10]. A major contribution to most of these
diseases is ROS and the flavonoids have been considered
to have protective effect against ROS generation [11].
Several efforts have been taken to identify the mechanism
of action of these important dietary constituents and a few
studies have reported their perturbations of the signalling
pathways [12]. However, no studies have as yet reported
any effect of the flavonoids on histone acetylation. Hence,
we attempted to identify the possible mechanism of action
of flavonoids in the context of epigenetic modifications
with special emphasis on histone acetylation.
By employing systematic screening of the
pomegranate skin tannins and flavonoids, we found
that luteolin, but not the structurally related apigenin,

Results
Luteolin from PCE inhibits p300 KAT activity
The Pomegranate crude extract (PCE) components
(Figure 1A) were screened using p300 acetyltransferase
and arginine methyltransferase (RMTase), CARM1
(Figure 1B). Our earlier study had shown that the crude
extract had a strong inhibitory activity on these two classes
of enzymes [2]. Of all the compounds, only ellagic acid
was found to inhibit CARM1 (Figure 1B). However, most
strikingly luteolin could almost completely inhibit the
acetyltransferase activity of p300 very potently while all
the other components were ineffective.
Luteolin is a dietary flavonoid, which possesses
diverse important physiological effects on human cells.
The flavonoids include flavonols, dihydroflavonols,
flavones, isoflavones, flavanones, anthocyanins, and
anthocyanidins. Significantly, of the different flavonoids,
we screened for the major category of flavones (luteolin,
apigenin, chrysin, pinostrobin), flavonols (galangin,
kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, rutin, silymarin)
and flavanols (catechin, EGCG), only luteolin showed
potential p300 (but not PCAF) KAT inhibition ability
(Figure 1C). These compounds are characterised by polyhydroxy functional groups (Figure 1A). An earlier study
from our group has shown that the -OH group is critical
for the inhibition of KAT activity [13]. It is pertinent to

point out here that even apigenin which structurally differs
with luteolin only by one -OH group at 4’- position, could
not affect the p300 or PCAF KAT activity (Figure 1C).
Collectively, among all twelve flavonoids tested, only

luteolin could inhibit the KAT activity of p300.
It was intriguing that luteolin could inhibit p300
whereas the structurally similar apigenin did not have
any effect. To investigate whether the presence of an

additional –OH group conferred luteolin with differential
binding abilities; we performed a molecular simulation
and docking study on p300 minimal HAT domain (Figure
1D). We identified that luteolin and apigenin had common
binding sites on the acetyltransferase domain, of which
the important one being Y1467- identified in the C646,
p300 KAT inhibitor study [5]. However, the significant
difference between luteolin and apigenin binding to the
p300 HAT domain (HD) is with respect to two residues
(W1436 and C1438). Luteolin exhibited binding to W1436
which is a critical residue on p300 HD. In agreement with
this observation, point mutation of W1436 to alanine was
found to abolish the KAT activity of the p300 HD in an
earlier study [14]. Another unique residue for luteolin
binding is C1438 which was identified as a part of the
substrate binding loop L1 (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
various cancers and Rubinstein Taybi syndrome is
associated with mutations at C1438 [14]. The presence of
an additional –OH group in luteolin led to the binding to
two important residues on the p300 KAT domain which
results in an apparent decrease in the inhibition constant
by more than threefold as represented in supplementary
table 1. On the other hand, the same analysis was also
performed on PCAF acetyltransferase domain and
although there were common binding sides, the observed
Ki was too high which also correlated to the non-inhibitory
pattern observed in the in vitro assays (Supplementary
table 1).
As indicated in Figure 1E, luteolin inhibits p300
KAT activity with an IC50 of 7µM but had minimal effect
on PCAF even at 20µM concentration. To elucidate the
mechanism of inhibition of p300 activity by luteolin,
kinetic analysis for the enzyme inhibition was performed.
Luteolin inhibits p300 activity in competitive mode with
acetyl-coA binding site, whereas it was observed to have
characteristics of mixed inhibition with a predominance
of competitive binding to the histone binding site
(Supplementary figure 1).
These findings clearly indicate that luteolin is
a potent acetyltransferase inhibitor with preferential
specificity towards p300.

(Figure 2A, Lane 4). However, acetylation of histone H4
was relatively less inhibited and histone methylation was
unaffected. These results show that luteolin is a potent
inhibitor of KAT activity even in the cellular system at
low concentration. Hyperacetylation of histones and
nonhistone proteins are associated with the progression
of oral and liver cancer [3, 15, 16]. Inhibitors of KATs
have been implicated as one of the possible epigenetic
therapeutics [1]. We decided to investigate the effect of
luteolin on two important aspects of tumor progression;
cell migration and cell proliferation. It was observed that
treatment of luteolin to the UPCI:SCC029B oral cancer
cells significantly reduced the wound healing ability in
a dose dependent manner (Figure 2B). We also analyzed
the effect of luteolin on cell cycle distribution in HNSCC
cells and observed that after 24 h treatment with 25 µM
luteolin, increased accumulation of cells were observed
in S phase, which is indicative of cell cycle arrest. On the
contrary, upon treatment with 25 µM luteolin for 48 h,
around 16% of the cell population had accumulated in
sub-G1 phase, which is indicative of apoptosis (Figure
2C). Taken together, these data suggest that luteolin acts
as an anti-proliferative agent in oral squamous cancer
cells in culture. In order to see if the same effect of
luteolin was also observed in vivo, we analyzed whether
luteolin can inhibit the growth of CAL27 xenografts in
nude mice. We found that luteolin treatment (100 mg/kg
body weight) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 4
weeks, significantly suppressed the tumour growth in vivo
following 4 weeks of treatment (Figure 3A and 3B). No
significant change in body weight of luteolin treated mice
was observed during the treatment, thereby indicating that
luteolin is apparently non-toxic (Figure 3B, right panel).
The alteration of histone acetylation levels was determined
by performing immunohistochemical analysis of the
xenografted mice tumours. Luteolin treated mice tumours
showed decreased levels of H3K9 and K14 acetylation
(Figure 3C) thus implicating its KAT inhibitory activity
in the tumour tissue. Luteolin inhibited H3 acetylation
more potently than H4 acetylation (Figure 3C) which is
in accordance with the inhibition pattern from KB cells.
The tumour samples also showed decreased levels of
proliferation marker Ki67 in the luteolin treated mice.
Reduced levels of Ki67 in the tumour sample support the
anti-proliferation and anti-tumour activity of luteolin.

To determine the physiological role for this
inhibitor, KB cells which exhibit hyperacetylation were
treated with luteolin. The acetylation inhibition was
observed at low micromolar concentrations (5µM) in the
oral cancer cell line after 6 hours of treatment, lower than
the observed IC50 from in vitro assay. A decrease in histone
H3 acetylation (H3K9 and H3K14) was observed upon
luteolin treatment. At 10 µM concentration, an almost
complete inhibition of these marks could be observed

Since histone acetylation modulates gene
expression, we investigated the effect of acetylation
directly upon inhibition of p300 KAT activity in CAL27
cells. An equal number of genes were seen to be up- and
downregulated upon luteolin treatment (Figure 4A). Upon
closer inspection of the genes, genes like interleukin-6

(Figure 4B). Also, genes like E2F2 which control the cell

[22-24], were upregulated (Figure 4B). These changes

inhibition of cancer progression. In order to understand
the direct effect of luteolin mediated inhibition of histone
acetylation on gene expression, we performed a chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis for H3K9 acetylation
on gene promoters using UPCI:SCC029B oral cancer
cell line treated with 10 µM luteolin. Interestingly, on
the promoters of factors like IL6 and ADORA1, which
are upregulated in cancers and are associated with
poor prognosis, histone acetylation was found to be
significantly repressed upon luteolin treatment (Figure
4C). In addition, luteolin treatment could significantly
reduce the H3K9 acetylation on the promoter of TENM1,
which is observed to be upregulated in several cancers.
However, histone acetylation on the promoter of tumor
suppressor E2F2 showed no significant change in response
to luteolin. Thus, the inhibitory potential of luteolin could
directly be correlated with reduced acetylation on gene
promoters, especially in case of tumor promoting factors.
Interestingly, we noted that DICER showed an

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

upregulation of expression upon luteolin treatment (Figure
4B). This suggested possible changes in the miRNA
profile in addition to the gene expression changes that
were observed. Indeed, we observed that treatment of
luteolin in KB cells triggered both up-regulation as well
as down-regulation of various sets of miRNA (Figure
5A). About 40 miRNAs including let7c showed more than
2-fold differential expression in 10µM luteolin treated
cells over DMSO treated cells (Figure 5B). The alteration
of miRNA expression by luteolin was also validated in
the UPCI:SCC029B oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.
Treatment of luteolin induced upregulation of miR221,
miR98 and let7c as well as downregulated expression of
miR135a, miR1281 and miR377 were down-regulated
as also validated by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 5C). A
large percentage of the dysregulated genes and miRNAs
belonged to the categories of gene expression, signal
transduction and cell proliferation, which are the principal
processes controlling cancer progression (Figure 5D).

associated with cancer. Also, the mapping of DICER as an important node suggests that the activity of luteolin is at multiple levels: at the
level of gene expression, miRNA expression and miRNA processing.

Interestingly, luteolin has been shown to
downregulate cell cycle associated genes in several
cancer cell models and partly has been attributed to its
effect on the phospho-signaling cascade albeit in higher
concentrations than reported here [25]. Hence, in order
to visualize the interactions that are associated with p300
acetylation inhibition by luteolin with gene and miRNA
perturbations, we modelled a miRNA and gene network
map. This analysis clearly portrays a complex regulatory
network with various genes and miRNAs centered around
cell proliferation and signal transduction (Figure 5E).
As predicted earlier, DICER forms an important node,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

indicating that luteolin influences miRNA expression and
miRNA processing in addition to the other effect on other
pathways. Also, factors like IL6, ADORA1, ODZ1 and
E2F2 which have been validated by H3K9ac ChIP, formed
important nodes in this network.
Taking together all these observations, it is clear
that luteolin treatment leads to an overall perturbation of
gene expression and miRNA profile favouring a tumor
suppression effect, thereby signifying the protective role
of the dietary flavonoid luteolin as an anticancer agent.

Discussion

as well as in HNSCC xenograft tumor model. Histone
acetylation regulates gene expression, and treatment with
luteolin resulted in dysregulated expression of important
inflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulatory proteins,
this being a direct downstream effect of reduced histone
acetylation on these gene promoters. Consistently, gene
expression, cell proliferation and immune response formed
important nodes when we mapped the gene expression and
miRNA expression data as a network. The GO clustering
of the altered miRNA clearly implicate an upregulation
of tumor suppressive miRNA and a down-regulation of
tumorogenic miRNA expression. Although broad spectrum
HDACi treatments alter the miRNA expression profile, the
direct role of KAT activity in miRNA expression is yet
to be elucidated. Significantly, we found that one of the
upregulated genes, DICER formed an important node,
indicating potential regulation of miRNA maturation,
along with changes in expression of miRNAs. Knocking
down DICER leads to changes in chromatin signature
and hence, affects gene expression, with an increase in
histone acetylation and decrease in methylation [33-35].
Hence, the changes in gene and miRNA expression might
also be a result of other additional phenomena, apart from
the direct effect of luteolin on p300-mediated histone
acetylation.
We found that 6 hours treatment of luteolin to KB
and SCC029B cells differentially regulates the expression
of miRNAs which play crucial roles in angiogenesis and
cancer cell proliferation. Incidentally, the pomegranate
juice components tested against prostate cancer cells also
revealed a similar miRNA alteration profile [36]. However,
in this report we have provided a concise miRNA-gene
network that is exclusive to luteolin treatment at an IC50
of 7µM concentration in the oral cancer cells. This finding
may contribute immensely to our search for a therapeutic
agent which is obtained from natural products that may
prove to be valuable tool to fight against oral cancer. This
study also appropriately connects the alteration of histone
acetylation to tumour regression through regulation of
gene expression directly and by miRNA regulation.

Crude extract of pomegranate (PCE) has been
considered as a therapeutic agent for several decades
and its medicinal values have been observed as antimicrobial, anti-parasitic, anti-viral and anti-cancer
effects. Ellagic acid or TBBD isolated from PCE exerts
PRMT4/CARM1 inhibitory effect which specifically
translates to histone H3R17 methylation inhibition
without affecting H3R26 methylation [6]. In our present
study, we observed that a few components of PCE also
inhibit lysine acetyltransferase activity of p300. A few
of these, such as gallic acid and EGCG have already
been reported to have epigenetic modulatory effect [26,
27]. A significant observation from our study was that
an important dietary flavonoid, luteolin was found to be
a potent p300 acetyltransferase inhibitor. Apart from the
reported EGCG and luteolin (identified in our present
study), no other component exhibited any significant
p300 inhibition. The flavanoids and luteolin are widely
acclaimed for their antioxidant properties and their overall
protective effect. The fact that they are present in edible
fruits and vegetables, implicates their biological utility.
We also identified that the structurally related apigenin
does not inhibit p300 activity which could be ascribed to
their differential binding on to the p300 HAT domain. A
significant observation is that when apigenin is tested ex
vivo on tissues, it is known to get converted to luteolin
and then metabolised by the system [28]. All these studies
suggest that luteolin is a biologically useful molecule
and it can be metabolised without any accumulation
and downstream side effects. Several theories have
been presented to elucidate the mechanism behind the
anticancer activity of luteolin. Recently, it was reported
that luteolin potentiates histone deacetylase inhibition
activity [29] whereas another report suggests that it
inhibits kinase activity of aurora B [30] and thereby blocks
cancer cell proliferation. However, it inhibits HDACs at
a very high concentration (100µM) as compared to its
kinase and acetylation inhibitory concentration (5-10µM).
Histone hyperacetylation is a common characteristic of
oral cancers and thus the KAT inhibitors have proved to be
a promising therapeutic agent against it. Luteolin inhibits
tumour progression by inhibiting angiogenesis probably
by inhibiting acetylation, as p300 acetyltransferase
activity is closely related to angiogenesis. Silencing p300/
CBP results in compromised tube formation and inhibits
angiogenesis [31]. Several studies on cancer models both
as cell lines and tumours have investigated the effect
of luteolin on angiogenesis and it has been shown that
luteolin downregulates VEGF expression [32]. A major
conclusion from our study also supports the antiangiogenic
property of luteolin. There is also evidence of luteolin
mediated induction of apoptosis in the oral cancer cell line
used for the xenograft study as observed by the cell cycle
analysis. We show that luteolin inhibits acetylation in cells,

Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples
Was performed as described in [37] and is described
in the supplementary section.

Gene expression analysis
Was performed as described earlier in [6]. Briefly,
following treatment with luteolin, total RNA was isolated
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized
with oligo(dT) (28-mer) (Invitrogen) and Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma), and
expression analysis was carried out using SYBR Green
supermix (Kapa) and gene-specific primers.

Microarray and miRNA array

Conflicts of Interest

Were performed using RNA extracted using the
Trizol method. The array and the following analysis was
performed as described previously [7] and is described in
the supplementary section.
