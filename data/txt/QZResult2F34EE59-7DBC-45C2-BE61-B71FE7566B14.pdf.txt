Abstract
Delphinidin, a major anthocyanidin present in many pigmented fruits and vegetables, possesses antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiangiogenic properties. In this study, we
provide evidence that it could be developed as a novel agent
against human prostate cancer (PCa). We observed that
delphinidin treatment to human PCa LNCaP, C4-2, 22RN1,
and PC3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell
growth without having any substantial effect on normal
human prostate epithelial cells. We selected PC3 cells as a
test model system because of their highly aggressive proliferative nature. Delphinidin treatment of cells resulted in a dosedependent induction of apoptosis and arrest of cells in G2-M
phase. This induction of apoptosis seems to be mediated via
activation of caspases because N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-AlaAsp(OMe)-fluromethylketone significantly reduced apoptosis
induced by delphinidin. We also observed that delphinidin
treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in (a)
phosphorylation of IKB kinase ; (NEMO), (b) phosphorylation
of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) inhibitory protein IKBA, (c)
phosphorylation of NF-KB/p65 at Ser536 and NF-KB/p50 at
Ser529, (d) NF-KB/p65 nuclear translocation, and (e) NF-KB
DNA binding activity. Delphinidin administration (2 mg, i.p.
thrice weekly) to athymic nude mice implanted with PC3 cells
resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth. Analysis
of tumors from delphinidin-treated mice showed significant
decrease in the expression of NF-KB/p65, Bcl2, Ki67, and
PCNA. Taken together, our data suggest that delphinidin could
be developed as an agent against human PCa. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The public health effect of prostate cancer (PCa) poses a serious
concern in the world, especially in Western countries. In the year
2008, in the United States alone 186,320 new cases of PCa will be
diagnosed and a total of 28,660 deaths are predicted (1). PCa is
generally detected in men >50 years of age, usually at an advanced
stage of the disease. Because of unsatisfactory outcomes associated
with treating advanced cases of PCa, there is a need to develop
novel preventive approaches to control this disease. One such
preventive approach is through chemoprevention by using
naturally occurring dietary substances (2). In recent years, there

is considerable activity in establishing the usefulness of naturally
occurring dietary agents for chemoprevention as well as chemotherapy of PCa. Polyphenols are one group of such agents, many of
which have been shown to be multitarget agents interfering with
several processes involved in cancer development and progression
(3). Among polyphenols, the anthocyanidins and their glycosylated
forms (anthocyanins) are gaining considerable popularity on the
fast-expanding market of food supplements as they seem to
possess potentially beneficial effects against various diseases (4, 5)
including cancer. These anthocyanidins are widely found in
pigmented fruits and vegetables such as pomegranate, berry, grape,
sweet potato, red cabbage, red radish, and eggplant (6, 7).
Delphinidin (Fig. 1A, inset), one of the major anthocyanidin present
in these fruits and vegetables, is a diphenylpropane-based
polyphenolic ring structure that carries a positive charge in its
central ring (8). It has been reported that delphinidin possesses
antioxidant (9), anti-inflammatory (10), and antimutagenic properties (11), and we recently showed that it inhibits invasion of
breast cancer cells (12). Other studies have revealed the
antiangiogenic effects of delphinidin in in vitro and in vivo model
systems (13–15).
We reported chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of
pomegranate fruit juice against PCa (16) and speculated that these
effects are mediated by the anthocyanidins present therein.
Pomegranate fruit extract, which we have used in our earlier
studies, was found to contain six anthocyanidins, among which
delphinidin was the major component (17). In this study, we show
for the first time that delphinidin induces apoptosis and cell
growth inhibition of highly aggressive human PCa PC3 cells in
in vitro system and significantly inhibits tumor growth in in vivo
xenograft mouse model and that these effects are mediated
through the inhibition of nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) signaling.

Figure 1. Effect of delphinidin on cell viability and apoptosis of LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rr1, and PC3 cells. A, human PCa cells were treated with vehicle alone (0.1% DMSO)
and specified concentrations of delphinidin in 0.1% DMSO for 48 h, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay as detailed in Materials and Methods. The
values are represented as the percent viable cells, with vehicle-treated cells regarded as 100% viable. Points, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. Inset,
delphinidin structure. B, representative micrographs of PC3 cells undergoing apoptosis induced by treatment with specified concentrations of delphinidin for 48 h
as assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Green fluorescence of Annexin V staining represents the cells undergoing apoptosis and red fluorescence of propidium iodide
shows the cells undergoing either necrosis or late apoptosis as detected with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope.

Upstate Biotechnology. Cleaved PARP antibody was procured from
Promega. The general caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-AlaAsp(OMe)-fluromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) was obtained from R&D
Systems, Inc. Rhodamine Red-X–conjugated antibody was procured from
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Antimouse or antirabbit
secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate was obtained from
Amersham Pharmacia Life Sciences. Novex precast 12% Tris-glycine gels
were obtained from Invitrogen. Matrigel was procured from BD Bioscience.
Treatment of cells. Cells were grown to 50% to 70% confluence and
then treated with freshly prepared delphinidin solution in DMSO. The final
concentration of DMSO used was 0.1% (v/v) for each treatment. Control
cells treated with 0.1% DMSO served as the vehicle group. After 48 h of
treatment with delphinidin (30–180 Amol/L), the cells were harvested, and
cell lysates were prepared and stored at 80jC for subsequent use. For
caspase inhibition experiments, the PC3 cells were pretreated with
10 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK, a general caspase inhibitor, 4 h before the
addition of delphinidin (120 Amol/L) in the culture media.
Cell viability assay. The effect of delphinidin on cell viability of PC3,
LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rr1, and prostate epithelial cells was determined by the
MTT assay. Cells were plated at a density of 1  104 per well in 200 AL of
complete culture medium and treated with delphinidin (30–180 Amol/L)
in 96-well microtiter plates for 48 h. After incubation for a specified time
at 37jC in a humidified incubator, MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS; diluted in
10 mL of serum-free medium) was added to each well and incubated for
2 h, after which the plate was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4jC.
After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 mL buffered DMSO was added to
each well. The absorbance was recorded on a microplate reader at the
wavelength of 540 nm. The effect of delphinidin on cell growth inhibition
was assessed as percent cell viability, where vehicle-treated cells were
taken as 100% viable.
Detection of apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy. The Annexin
V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Diagnostic Corp.) was used for the detection
of apoptotic bodies following the vendor’s protocol. This kit uses a dualstaining protocol in which the cells show green fluorescence of Annexin V
(apoptotic cells) and red fluorescence of propidium iodide (necrotic cells or
late apoptotic cells). PC3 cells were grown to f60% confluence and then
treated with delphinidin as described above. The fluorescence was detected
with a Zeiss Axiophot DM HT microscope. Images were captured with an
attached camera.

Quantification of apoptosis by flow cytometry. For quantification of
apoptosis, PC3 cells were grown at a density of 50% to 60% confluence in
100-mm culture dishes and were treated with 10 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK
(a general caspase inhibitor) for 4 h, washed with PBS, and then treated with
delphinidin for 48 h. The cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and were
processed for labeling with fluorescein-tagged dUTP and propidium iodide
by the use of an APO-DIRECT apoptosis kit (Phoenix Flow Systems) as per
manufacturer’s protocol. The labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
DNA cell cycle analysis. PC3 cells (50–60% confluent) were
synchronized by overnight serum starvation and treated with delphinidin
(30–180 Amol/L) for 48 h in complete medium. The cells were trypsinized,
washed twice with chilled PBS, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 50 AL cold PBS to which cold methanol (450 AL) was
added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4jC. The cells were
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min; the pellet was washed twice with
chilled PBS, suspended in 500 AL PBS, and incubated with 5 AL RNase
(20 Ag/mL final concentration) at 37jC for 30 min. The cells were chilled
on ice for 10 min and incubated with propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL final
concentration) for 1 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry
was done with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). A minimum of 10,000 cells
per sample were counted and the DNA histograms were further analyzed
by using ModiFitLT software (Verity Software House) for cell cycle analysis.
Immunoblot analysis. The total cell lysates were prepared, and
immunoblot analysis was done as described earlier (18). The protein
concentration was determined by using a bicinchoninic acid protein
assay kit.
ELISA. Following treatment of cells with delphinidin (30–180 Amol/L) for
48 h, cells were harvested and nuclear lysates were prepared as described
earlier (18). The commercially available kit for NF-nB/p65 (purchased from
Active Motif) contains the specific oligos with the specific consensus
sequence for NF-nB/p65 binding. Five micrograms of nuclear lysate protein
from each group were taken for quantification of NF-nB activity. The
experiment was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Absorbance was taken at 450 nm by using ELISA reader (Multiscan MCC/
340, Fisher Scientific).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) for NF-nB was done using a LightShift chemiluminescent
EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer’s protocol. NF-nB oligo was
biotin labeled using the Biotin 3¶ End DNA Labeling Kit (Pierce

Biotechnology). The sequence of NF-nB oligonucleotide was 5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶; 3¶-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5¶.
Briefly, 5 Ag of nuclear extract were incubated with 20 Ag of NF-nB/p65
antibody at room temperature for 30 min, followed by further incubation
with 1 pmol of biotin-labeled NF-nB oligonucleotide for 30 min at 37jC. The
DNA protein complex formed was resolved on 6% DNA retardation gel and
transferred onto a nylon membrane. After transfer was completed, DNA was
cross-linked to the membrane at 120 mJ/cm2 using a UV cross-linker. The
biotin end-labeled DNA was detected using the streptavidin-horseradish
peroxide conjugate and LightShift chemiluminescent substrate according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The membrane was exposed to X-ray
film (XAR-5 Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and developed using a Kodak
film processor.
Immunocytochemical staining of NF-KB/p65. Cells were seeded in
two chambered tissue culture glass slides and treated with delphinidin as
described previously. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then
permeabilized in cold methanol ( 20jC). After that, cells were washed
thrice with PBS and blocked with 2% donkey serum in 1 PBS for 1 h and
incubated with NF-nB/p65 antibody [1:50 in 5% donkey serum (1 PBS)]
overnight at 4jC. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with
1:50 of donkey anti-rabbit Rhodamine Red-X–conjugated antibody for 1 h at
room temperature. Slides were mounted using Prolong antifade kit
(Invitrogen) and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot DMHT microscope.
Luciferase assay. PC3 cells (2  106) were electroporated with human
NF-nB luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-nB-TA-Luc; 1 Ag; Clontech
Laboratories, Inc.) along with 50 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid
pRL-TK (Promega), which was used as internal control to normalize

transfection efficiency using AMAXA nucleofection kit. Parallel to that, cells
were also transfected with empty pTA-Luc reporter vector (1 Ag). After
electroporation, 30,000 cells were distributed per well of a 24-well plate and
allowed to grow for 16 h followed by delphinidin treatment for another
24 h with the above described concentrations. Dual luciferase assay reagent
kit was procured from Promega and luciferase activity was measured
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In vivo tumor xenograft model. Athymic (nu/nu) male nude mice,
obtained from NxGen Biosciences, were housed under pathogen-free
conditions with a 12 h light/12 h dark schedule and fed with an autoclaved
diet and water ad libitum. To establish tumor xenografts in mice, PC3 cells
(1  106) were suspended in 1:1 medium mixed with Matrigel and were s.c.
inoculated on the left and right flanks of each mouse. Twelve animals were
then randomly divided into two groups with six animals each. The first
group of animals received i.p. injection of 100 AL of 1:10 ratio of DMSO and
normal saline, whereas animals of the second group received i.p. injection of
delphinidin (2 mg/animal in 100 AL of 1:10 ratio of DMSO and normal
saline) thrice a week. Tumor sizes were measured every week, and tumor
volume was calculated by the formula 0.5238  L 1  L 2  H, where L 1
is the long diameter, L 2 is the short diameter, and H is the height of the
tumor. All animals in non–delphinidin-treated group were sacrificed and
removed from the protocol when the tumor crossed the targeted volume of
1,200 mm3. Because this occurred at 8 wk on test, at this time three animals
from delphinidin-treated group were also sacrificed, and tumors were
excised and pooled for immunoblotting and imunohistochemistry. The
remaining animals of group 2 were allowed to remain in the protocol till
tumors reached the targeted volume of 1,200 mm3, at which time the
animals were sacrificed. All procedures were conducted in accordance with

the Institutional animal care and use committee.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Sections (5 Am thick) were cut from
paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from vehicle- and delphinidin-treated
animals. Immunostaining was done for Ki67, PCNA, NF-nB/p65, and Bcl2
using specific antibodies with appropriate dilutions and replaced with
either normal host serum or block for negative controls followed by staining
with appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies.
The slides were developed in diaminobenzidine and counterstained with a
weak solution of hematoxylin. The stained slides were dehydrated and
mounted in Permount and visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot DM HT
microscope.
Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s
t-test to assess statistical significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Delphinidin inhibits the growth of LNCaP, C4-2, 22RN1, and
PCa PC3 cells. To evaluate the effect of delphinidin on cell viability
of human PCa and normal prostate epithelial cells, MTT assay was
done. Delphinidin treatment to PCa cells resulted in a significant
dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value
at 48 hours posttreatment with delphinidin for LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rr1,
and PC3 cells was 50, 70, 65, and 90 Amol/L, respectively, suggesting
differential dose response of PCa cells to delphinidin (Fig. 1A).
Similar doses of delphinidin showed insignificant effect on cell
viability of prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 1A). Taking into account

www.aacrjournals.org

the more aggressive and highly metastatic nature of PCa, PC3 cells
were selected then as a model system to conduct mechanistic
studies in in vitro and in vivo xenografts.
Delphinidin induces apoptosis in PC3 cells. To test whether
delphinidin-mediated decrease in cell growth is due to induction of
apoptosis, we conducted Annexin V and propidium iodide
stainings in delphinidin-treated cells. Data showed a significant
induction of apoptosis by delphinidin at doses of 60 to 180 Amol/L
in cells, which was evident from the significant enhancement in
Annexin V staining (Fig. 1B).
Delphinidin induces PARP cleavage and increases Bax/Bcl2
ratio in PC3 cells. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein is
activated following DNA damage and is cleaved into a 85-kDa
COOH-terminal fragment, with a reduced catalytic activity, and a
24-kDa NH2-terminal peptide, which retains the DNA binding
domains. During induction of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation leads
to activation of PARP; therefore, cleavage of PARP protein is
considered as an important biomarker of apoptosis. Immunoblot
analysis showed a significant dose-dependent increase in cleaved
PARP in cells treated with delphinidin (Fig. 2A). It has been shown
that Bcl2 forms a heterodimeric complex with the apoptotic Bax
protein, thereby neutralizing its apoptotic effects. Therefore, the
ratio of Bax/Bcl2 is often considered as a decisive factor in
determining whether cells will undergo death or survive. We
observed that delphinidin treatment of cells resulted in a decrease
in Bcl2 expression with a concomitant increase in the protein level

of Bax (Fig. 2A). This resulted in a substantial increase in Bax/Bcl2
ratio, which favors apoptosis. Taken together, these findings
suggest that cleavage in PARP protein, up-regulation of Bax, and
down-regulation of Bcl2 may collectively form a molecular basis for
the apoptotic action of delphinidin.
Delphinidin induces apoptosis via activation of caspases in
PC3 cells. In most cancer cells, caspases are present in the proforms (inactive) and require site-specific cleavage of the protein to
become active and participate in the process of apoptosis. To test
whether caspases are involved in apoptosis induction by delphinidin, we first evaluated the protein levels of procaspases and
active caspases in delphinidin-treated cells. Data presented in
Fig. 2A showed a significant and progressive increase in the levels
of active caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins in delphinidin-treated
cells. To test whether delphinidin induces apoptosis via activation
of caspases, we used a general caspases inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK.
Delphinidin (120 Amol/L)–treated cells exhibited 17.3% terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling–positive cells, which was significantly reduced to 8.25% with
the treatment of cells with Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 2B). Immunoblot
analysis showed that delphinidin-induced activation of caspase-3
and caspase-9 was significantly reduced after caspase inhibitor

treatment (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that induction of
caspases may be a possible mechanism by which delphinidin
induces apoptosis in PC3 cells.
Delphinidin causes G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in PC3 cells.
Several studies have shown that the induction of apoptosis might be
due to cell cycle arrest (19, 20). Therefore, inhibition of the cell cycle
has been appreciated as a target for the management of cancer
(21, 22). To assess the effect of delphinidin treatment on the
distribution of cells in the cell cycle, we performed DNA cell cycle
analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, compared with vehicle treatment,
delphinidin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation
of cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle by 16% and 42% at 60 and
120 Amol/L concentrations of delphinidin, respectively. These data
suggest that delphinidin induces cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase.
Delphinidin modulates cell cycle regulatory proteins in PC3
cells. Molecular analysis of human cancers has revealed that cell
cycle regulators are frequently mutated in most common
malignancies (23, 24). We next examined the effect of delphinidin
on cell cycle inhibitory proteins p27/KIP1 and p21/WAF1, which
are involved in cell cycle progression. Immunoblot analysis showed
a significant induction of these proteins in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3B). We next evaluated the effect of delphinidin on

the protein levels of cyclins and cdks, which are known to be
regulated by KIP1/p27 and WAF1/p21. Delphinidin treatment of
cells resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in the
protein levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin A as well as cdk1 and cdk2
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest that delphinidin restores proper
checkpoint control via modulation of the cyclins, cdks, and the
expression of their inhibitors.
Delphinidin inhibits expression, translocation, and DNA
binding activity of NF-KB in PC3 cells. It has been shown that
activation of NF-nB blocks apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation (25). We tested whether delphinidin treatment inhibits
constitutive NF-nB activation. Using immunoblot analysis, we
observed that delphinidin treatment of cells resulted in decreased
phospho-NF-nB/p50 at Ser529 and phospho-NF-nB/p65 at Ser536 in
the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A). We further confirmed the inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

of NF-nB/p65 DNA binding activity by performing EMSA and
immunocytochemistry. Delphinidin treatment of cells resulted in a
dose-dependent decrease in NF-nB DNA binding activity (Fig. 4B).
Delphinidin-treated cells exhibited a marked decrease in NF-nB
nuclear localization, further suggesting inhibition of NF-nB nuclear
translocation (Fig. 4C). Delphinidin treatment of cells showed no
cytoplasmic immunostaining with anti-p65 antibody at doses of
120 to 180 Amol/L, whereas control cells showed an intense nuclear
fluorescence (Fig. 4C). However, delphinidin treatment at doses of
60 Amol/L showed weak expression of NF-nB/p65 in the nucleus
(Fig. 4C). Using a specific NF-nB/p65 ELISA, we also found that
treatment of cells with delphinidin resulted in a significant
inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-nB/p65 in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4D). These results correspond with the
NF-nB DNA binding activity data and further support the inhibition
of nuclear translocation of NF-nB/p65 subunit into the nucleus
by delphinidin. To further examine the effects of delphinidin on
NF-nB, we performed NF-nB promoter activity assay using NF-nB
binding sites containing luciferase reporter plasmid. Delphinidin
treatment of cells resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease
in NF-nB luciferase activity (Fig. 5A), suggesting its effect at the
transcriptional level.
Delphinidin inhibits protein levels of phospho-IKBA and its
upstream kinase phospho-IKK; (NEMO) in PC3 cells. In the
absence of stimulatory signals, NF-nB resides in the cytoplasm in
the form of hetrodimeric complex with its inhibitory proteins InBa.
Stimulation to the cells with various stimuli activates the InB
kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits
(IKKa and IKKh) and a regulatory subunit (IKKg/NEMO).
Activated IKK phosphorylates NF-nB–bound InB proteins and
targets them for polyubiquitination and rapid degradation by
creating a binding site for SCFh-TRCP-ubiquitin ligase complex (26).
Delphinidin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in
the phosphorylation of the NF-nB inhibitory protein InBa with a
concomitant increase in total InBa protein (Fig. 5B). InB is
regulated by upstream kinase IKKg (NEMO), which phosphorylates
InB. We observed that delphinidin treatment of cells resulted in a
significant inhibition of pIKKg protein (Fig. 5B), but no such effect
was observed on the protein level of the IKKa catalytic subunit.
These results suggest that delphinidin inhibits NF-nB signaling via
inhibition of upstream kinases.
Delphinidin inhibits tumorigenicity of PC3 cells in xenograft
mouse model. Because delphinidin was observed to be effective
in inhibiting the growth of PCa cells in vitro, we next determined
whether these results could be translated into an in vivo
xenograft mouse model. Delphinidin treatment did not cause
any loss in the body weight and food intake (data not shown),
indicating that the dosages used were not toxic to the animals.
The average volume of tumors in non–delphinidin-treated mice
increased as a function of time and reached the targeted volume
of 1,200 mm3 at 8 weeks postinoculation. However, at this time, in
mice treated with delphinidin, the average tumor volume was
only 361 mm3 (Fig. 6A). Next, we evaluated the extent of tumor
growth inhibition in delphinidin-treated animals and found that
the targeted tumor volume of 1,200 mm3 was reached at 12 weeks
(Fig. 6A). The observed differences for tumor development in
delphinidin-treated mice compared with control mice were
statistically significant (P<0.01; Fig. 6A). From these data, we
conclude that delphinidin is an effective anticancer agent that has
the potential to inhibit or slow the tumorigenicity of PCa PC3
cells in in vivo system.

Delphinidin modulates the protein levels of Bcl2 and Bax
and inhibits the protein levels of NF-KB and cyclin D1 in PC3
originated tumors in athymic nude mice. Because delphinidin
treatment was observed to modulate the expression levels of Bax
and Bcl2 under in vitro conditions, we determined the effect of
delphinidin administration on the expression levels of Bax and
Bcl2 in tumors excised from both groups of animals. As shown in
Fig. 6B, delphinidin administration was observed to decrease the
expression level of Bcl2 protein. Tumor sections from delphinidinadministered mice also exhibited significantly reduced Bcl2positive cells compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 6C).
Inversely, a significant increase in the expression level of Bax was
observed in tumor tissues of animals treated with delphinidin.
Further, immunoblot analysis of NF-nB and cyclin D1 in tumor
tissues of delphinidin-treated mice also showed a significant
decrease in these proteins (Fig. 6B). In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of NF-nB showed a weak nuclear staining of
phospho-NF-nB in delphinidin-treated tumor tissues as compared
with vehicle-treated tissues (Fig. 6C). These data further show the

involvement of NF-nB signaling in the inhibition of tumor growth
by delphinidin.
Delphinidin inhibits Ki67 and PCNA expression in PC3
originated tumors in athymic nude mice. As delphinidin
treatment was observed to inhibit or decrease the tumorigenic
potential of PC3 cells in vivo, we next determined the effect of
delphinidin on the protein levels of Ki67 and PCNA, which are known
markers of proliferation. It was evident from the immunohistochemical analysis of tumors that animals receiving delphinidin
exhibited significant decrease in Ki67- and PCNA-positive cells
compared with vehicle-treated animals (which exhibited intense
staining for these proteins), suggesting the antiproliferative efficacy
of delphinidin under in in vivo conditions (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in American men, being next only to lung cancer. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to intensify our efforts to identify novel
agents that could delay or prevent the development of PCa.

Delphinidin and Prostate Cancer

Recently, chemoprevention and other intervention strategies using
naturally occurring agents have emerged as a promising alternative
option that could prevent or slow the tumor growth and thus
improve the quality of life of PCa patients. In this regard, several
fruit- and vegetable-derived chemopreventive agents have been
reported that induce apoptosis in cancer cells in both in vitro and
in vivo systems (27, 28). We have previously reported that
pomegranate fruit extract induces apoptosis in PCa cells and
inhibits tumor growth in athymic nude mice (16). Because
pomegranate fruit extract contains several anthocyanidins, among
which delphinidin is one of the most abundant constituent (17), we
hypothesized that pomegranate fruit extract–induced effects might
be largely due to the presence of delphinidin. In the present study,
we observed the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of
delphinidin on PCa PC3 cells both in vitro and in vivo. We
observed that the primary mode of delphinidin-mediated inhibition of tumor growth is through the induction of apoptosis.
Because caspases have been shown to be involved in apoptosis via
activation of downstream effector molecules such as PARP (29, 30),
we found that the induction of apoptosis by delphinidin is
governed primarily by the activation of caspases because
pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, significantly
prevented delphinidin-mediated apoptosis.
Bcl2 is an upstream effector molecule in the apoptotic pathway
and has been identified as a potent suppressor of apoptosis (31),
and most cancers including PCa generally overexpress Bcl2 (32, 33)
thereby escaping apoptosis and undermining therapy. Bcl2 forms a
heterodimer with the apoptotic protein Bax and thereby neutralizes its apoptotic effects. Therefore, alteration in the ratio of Bax/
Bcl2 is a decisive factor that plays an important role to determine
whether cells will undergo apoptosis. We and others have
previously shown the involvement of caspases in the induction of
apoptosis by naturally occurring, potentially useful cancer chemopreventive agents (34, 35). We observed that delphinidin significantly down-regulated Bcl2 protein and up-regulated levels of Bax
protein in PCa cells as well as in tumors from PC3 xenografts,
suggesting the involvement of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway by
which delphinidin induces apoptosis in PCa cells and inhibits
tumor growth in athymic nude mice.
Inhibition of tumorigenesis often involves modulation of signal
transduction pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and, consequently, apoptosis. It has been shown that activation of NF-nB
induces resistance to apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutic agents (36). Other studies suggest that activation of NF-nB
signaling induces inflammation and leads to carcinogenesis
(37, 38). In clinical studies of PCa specimens, overexpression of
NF-nB/p65 protein was shown to be an independent predictor of
poor prognosis in PCa patients (39). In prostatectomy specimens
of PCa with relapsed tumor, NF-nB was found to be concentrated
in the nuclear fraction (40). Therefore, effective inhibition of NF-nB
could be critical in providing a targeted pathway for PCa
prevention. We observed that treatment of PC3 with delphinidin
led to a dose-dependent decrease in the DNA binding potential of
NF-nB, thereby making it transcriptionally incompetent to drive

the expression of target genes. In addition, NF-nB nuclear exclusion
induced by delphinidin seems to further synergize with its inability
of binding to DNA to repress its function. Our observations suggest
that delphinidin inhibits NF-nB signaling through a sequence of
events that include inhibition of phosphorylation of IKKg (NEMO)
followed by inhibition of phosphorylation of InBa and restoration
of its subsequent degradation.
It has been reported that G2 abrogation prevents cancer cells from
repairing DNA damage, forcing them into M phase. Thus, the G2
checkpoint has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for
cancer therapy (41). Our study indicates that delphinidin exerts
strong growth inhibitory effects on human PCa cells by arresting
cells in G2-M phase. It is known that cell cycle is primarily regulated
by complexes containing cdks and cyclins, which are critical for the
progression of cell cycle and whose inactivation leads to cell cycle
arrest (42, 43). The observed inhibitory effects of delphinidin
particularly on cyclin D1, cyclin A, cdk1, and cdk2 in PCa cells
suggest its interference in cell cycle. Cdk activity is additionally
regulated by cdk inhibitors such as the p21/WAF1 and p27/KIP1
families of proteins. Our data show that delphinidin arrests PCa PC3
cells in G2-M phase via modulation of cell cycle regulatory molecules,
suggesting yet another important molecular mechanism through
which delphinidin inhibits the growth of PCa cells.
To establish the relevance of these in vitro findings to in vivo
situation, athymic nude mice were implanted with PC3 cells, which
are derived from bone metastasis and known to be highly
proliferative. Importantly, we observed that delphinidin significantly reduced tumor growth of PC3 xenograft (Fig. 6A). These
in vivo growth inhibitory effects of delphinidin could be correlated
well with the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of known cell
proliferative biomarkers. A significant increase in PARP cleavage,
an increase in Bax/Bcl2 protein ratio, and the inhibition of NF-nB/
p65, Ki67, and PCNA protein levels in delphinidin-treated tumors
suggest the involvement of similar molecular events as those
observed in the in vitro system. Our findings are significant because
the xenograft mouse model is extremely useful for preclinical
studies of anticancer agents (16, 27, 28).
The present study is the first report showing the effect of
delphinidin in inhibiting human PCa cell growth in in vitro model
as well as in in vivo preclinical setting via interference with the
NF-nB signaling pathway. In summary, based on the present
findings, it is tempting to suggest that delphinidin could be
developed as a potential anticancer agent against human PCa.
