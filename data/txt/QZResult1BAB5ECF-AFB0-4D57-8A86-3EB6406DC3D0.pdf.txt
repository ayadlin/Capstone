Abstract
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative
disorder caused by excessive granulopoiesis due to the formation of the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. An
effective drug against CML is imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor acting on Abl kinases, c-KIT, and plateletderived growth factor receptor. Recently, a study revealed that
patients treated with imatinib showed impaired CTL responses
compared with patients treated with IFN-A, which might be
due to a treatment-induced reduction in immunogenicity of
CML cells or immunosuppressive effects. In our study, we
found that inhibition of BCR-ABL leads to a down-regulation
of immunogenic antigens on the CML cells in response to
imatinib treatment, which results in the inhibition of CMLdirected immune responses. By treating CML cells with imatinib, we could show that the resulting inhibition of BCR-ABL
leads to a decreased expression of tumor antigens, including
survivin, adipophilin, hTERT, WT-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 in correlation to a decreased development of CML-specific CTLs. In
contrast, this reduction in immunogenicity was not observed
when a CML cell line resistant to the inhibitory effects of
imatinib was used, but could be confirmed by transfection with
specific small interfering RNA against BCR-ABL or imatinib
treatment of primary CML cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5489–97]

Introduction
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative
disease characterized by excessive proliferation and differentiation
of the myeloid cells in the bone marrow. The characteristic
cytogenetic hallmark in f90% of the patients is a shortened
chromosome 22, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome. It results
from a reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes
9 and 22 [t(9;22) (q34;q11)]. This translocation results in the
chimeric BCR-ABL oncogene, which is translated into a cytoplasmic protein with a strong constitutive tyrosine kinase activity (1).
The mechanisms involved in malignant transformation are not
yet fully understood, but the BCR-ABL translocation is believed to
be the etiologic event in the development of CML (2).
Recently, the introduction of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec/Glivec,
Novartis), an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity, has
strongly improved the therapy of CML, leading to a significant
prolongation of hematologic and cytogenetic remissions and the
mean survival time without inducing major adverse effects (1, 3–5).

Nevertheless, resistance to imatinib treatment is a problem. In
most cases, point mutations or an amplification of the BCR-ABL
gene are responsible for the loss of efficacy, but also BCR-ABL–
independent mechanisms like a differential gene expression in
resistant cells have been described (6–9).
Alternative treatment options to achieve remissions are
therefore still needed to combat CML, especially in patients
resistant to the standard forms of therapy, including IFN-a or
imatinib. For this purpose, immunotherapy trials using mostly
dendritic cell–based vaccination strategies have been conducted
(10, 11). In IFN-a–treated patients, antigen-specific CTLs recognizing a peptide derived from the overexpressed antigen proteinase
3 (PR3) could be detected. As anticipated, these cells were able to
contribute to the elimination of malignant cells (12, 13).
Today, the first class therapy of CML relies on imatinib rather
than on IFN-a. Consequently, the compatibility of this kind of
treatment with immune therapeutic strategies has to be examined.
In the present study, we therefore investigated the influence of
imatinib treatment on the inducibility of CTL responses to
CML-associated antigens using dendritic cells electroporated with
RNA from K-562 CML cells for CTL induction.
In Western blot and real-time PCR experiments we also analyzed
the expression of several antigens shown to be expressed in CML
and to potentially be associated with the immunogenicity of CML
cells (14–18) and tested the specificity of the CTLs in Elispot assays.
In our experiments, we were able to show that the down-regulation
of the expression or inhibition of the activity of BCR-ABL in CML
cells strongly impedes the generation of CTLs recognizing antigens
from the K-562 cell line as well as primary CML cells and is
associated with a down-regulation of several tumor antigens.
These results indicate that BCR-ABL is critical for the immunogenicity of CML cells, probably due to up-regulation of immunogenic antigens by its uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib
treatment is therefore likely to interfere with immunotherapeutic
approaches due to an inhibition of the priming of CTL responses in
patients.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines. The tumor cell line K-562 (CML in blast crisis;
American Type Culture Collection) was grown in RP10 medium (RPMI 1640
with glutamax I, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, all purchased from Gibco). K-562R
(K-562 cell line resistant to low doses of imatinib, kindly provided by the
group of J. Griffin, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) was grown in
RP10 medium supplemented with 0.5 Amol/L imatinib (19).
Flow cytometric measurement of apoptosis. DNA fragmentation
in apoptotic nuclei was measured by the method of Nicoletti et al. (20).
Briefly, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton
X-100, 50 Ag of propidium iodide per milliliter) to release apoptotic nuclei
and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest analysis software. Nuclei

to the left of the 2N peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered as
apoptotic.
PAGE and Western blotting. For the preparation of whole-cell lysates,
cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 1 mmol/L sodium-orthovanadate, and 100 mmol/L sodium
fluoride. Protein concentrations of protein lysates were determined using
a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Perbio Science). For the detection of
different tumor antigens, f20 Ag of whole-cell lysates were separated on
a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was probed with antibodies
to human survivin (R&D Systems), adipophilin (Progen Biotechnik), Bcl-2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-xL (BD Biosciences), x-linked inhibitor
of apoptosis protein (xIAP; BD Biosciences), PTEN (BD Biosciences),
phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR; Cell Signaling
Technology), and mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were
reprobed with antibody to human actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; HyTest Ltd.) to
confirm that equal amounts of protein were present in every lane.
Dendritic cell generation from adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dendritic cells were generated from adherent peripheral
blood monocytes as described before (21–25). Buffy coat preparations from
healthy volunteers were obtained from the blood bank of the University of
Tübingen (Tübingen, Germany). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll/Paque (Biochrom) density gradient
centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in serum-free X-VIVO 20 medium
(Cambrex) and allowed to adhere (1  108 cells per flask) in 275 mL cell
culture flasks in a final volume of 10 mL. After 2 h of incubation at 37jC and
5% CO2, nonadherent cells were removed by extensive washing and
cryopreserved at 80jC for later use in CTL induction and restimulation.
Dendritic cells were generated by culturing adherent monocytes in RP10
medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL human recombinant granulocyte
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF, Leukine Liquid Sargramostim, Berlex) and 20 ng/mL human recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4,
R&D Systems). The medium was replenished with cytokines every other
day. Maturation of dendritic cells was induced by addition of 20 ng/mL
human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a, R&D Systems) on
days 4 and 6 and mature dendritic cells were harvested for further
experiments on day 7 of culture.
Isolation of primary CML cells. Blood samples of newly diagnosed
CML patients were used for preparation of PBMCs by Ficoll/Paque density
gradient centrifugation.
RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen), including treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) according to
the protocol for isolation of total RNA from animal cells provided by the
manufacturer. Quantity and purity of the RNA was determined by UV
spectrophotometry. RNA samples were stored at 80jC.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was prepared as described
above. cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers and Superscript
reverse transcriptase (both from Invitrogen) by incubation of a 20 AL
mixture at 42jC for 50 min. Real-time PCR was done as a multiplex analysis
using predesigned TaqMan Gene Expression Assays with GAPDH as an
endogenous control on an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
determine the relative expression of selected genes, expression levels of the
target antigens were normalized to the endogenous control and then
calibrated to the control sample using the DDCT method.
Generation of in vitro transcripts. PR3-, PRAME-, WT1-, EGFP-, and
survivin-in vitro transcripts (IVT) were synthesized by CureVac GmbH.
RNA electroporation of dendritic cells and small interfering RNA
electroporation of CML cell lines. Electroporation of dendritic cells with
RNA was done as described previously (23, 24, 26). According to the same
protocol, electroporation of K-562 and K-562R cells with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) was conducted. For electroporation of dendritic cells,
mature dendritic cells were harvested on day 7 of culture, washed twice
with serum-free X-VIVO 20 medium (Cambrex), and resuspended to a final
concentration of 1  107 cells/mL. Subsequently, 200 AL of the cell

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

suspension were mixed with 5 Ag of RNA and electroporated in a 4-mm
cuvette (Peqlab) using an Easyject Plus unit (EquiBio/Peqlab) with the
following physical variables: voltage of 300 V, capacitance of 150 AF, and
resistance of 1,540 V. After electroporation, cells were immediately
transferred to RP10 medium supplemented with 100 ng/mL human
recombinant GM-CSF, 20 ng/mL human recombinant IL-4, and 20 ng/mL
human recombinant TNF-a (all from R&D Systems) and cultured in the
incubator overnight.
For electroporation with siRNA, K-562 or K-562R cells were harvested in
the log phase of growth, adjusted to 1  107 per milliliter. The cell
suspension (200 AL) was electroporated at the above conditions using
different amounts of siRNA ranging from 120 to 320 pmol, equivalent to
0.6 to 1.6 Amol/L siRNA per 2  106 cells in the volume used for
electroporation ( from Dharmacon). After electroporation, cells were
immediately transferred to RP10 medium. To the culture medium of
K-562R cells, 0.5 Amol/L imatinib were added. Cells were harvested 2 days
after transfection. The following siRNAs were used: sib3a2_1 (sense,
GCAGAGUUCAAAAGCCCUUdTdT; antisense, AAGGGCUUUUGAACUCUGCdTdT) and sib3a2_3 (sense, CAGAGUUCAAAAGCCCUUCdTdT;
antisense, GAAGGGCUUUUGAACUCUGdTdT) targeting BCR-ABL, the
mismatch control siRNA simis (sense, GCAGAGUUCUAAAGCGCUUdTdT;
antisense, AAGCGCUUUAGAACUCUGCdTdT), and the sequence-unrelated
control siGL2 against the firefly luciferase (sense, CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT; antisense, UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGUACGdTdT).
Induction of specific CTLs using dendritic cells transfected with
RNA. Dendritic cells were electroporated with RNAs of different sources and
cultured for 24 h as described above. For induction of specific CTLs,
5  105 dendritic cells were cocultured with 2  106 autologous nonadherent
cells in RP10 medium. After 7 days of culture, the CTLs were harvested and
5  105 CTLs were restimulated in coculture with 5  105 electroporated
dendritic cells and 2  106 irradiated nonadherent cells (30 Gy, Gammacell
1000, Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd.) per well. Human recombinant IL-2
(2 ng/mL; R&D Systems) was added on days 1, 3, and 5. Further restimulations were done on day 7 after the last restimulation as described above.
The specificity of the CTLs was analyzed in standard 51Cr-release assays.
Standard 51Cr-release assays (CTL assays). CTL assays were done as
described previously. Briefly, target cells were prepared by transfection of
dendritic cells with RNA 1 day before the assay. If needed, they were treated
with monoclonal antibodies Pa2.1 (10 Ag/mL) directed against HLA class I
molecules or Tü39 (10 Ag/mL) directed against HLA class II molecules
(kindly provided by S. Stevanovič, Department of Immunology, University of
Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany) for 30 min and then labeled with 51Cr
sodium chromate in RP10 medium for 1 h at 37jC, 5% CO2. In 96-well
round-bottomed culture plates, 1  104 target cells were seeded into each
well. Varying numbers of CTLs were added to a final volume of 200 AL.
Plates were incubated for 4 h at 37jC, 5% CO2 before the supernatants were
harvested (50 AL/well), transferred to scintillator-coated plates (LumaPlate96, Perkin-Elmer), and counted in a h-plate counter. The percentage of
specific lysis was calculated as follows: 100  (experimental release
spontaneous release) / (maximal release
spontaneous release). Spontaneous and maximal release were determined in the presence of either RP10
medium or 2% Triton X-100, respectively.
IFN-; Elispot assay. CTLs were harvested after the third restimulation
and incubated in an anti–IFN-g antibody (10 Ag/mL, Mabtech AB)–coated
96-well plate (Multiscreen-HA, Millipore Corporation) at a ratio of 4:1 and
1:1 with 5  104 autologous stimulators per well. Dendritic cells, which had
been electroporated with different RNA species 24 h before the assay as
described above, were used as stimulators. For the detection of spots, a
biotin-labeled anti-human IFN-g antibody (2 Ag/mL, Mabtech AB) was
used. Spots were counted using an automated Elispot reader (Immunospot
Analyzer, CTL Analyzers LLC).

transfected with EGFP -IVT were included as negative controls. K-562 cells were used as targets to exclude NK cell activity. HLA class I restriction was confirmed by

cells to either DMSO or imatinib treatment at 3 Amol/L for 48 h.
The number of apoptotic nuclei as analyzed by Nicoletti staining
was <35% in K-562 and <25% in K-562R cells (data not shown).
Total RNA was extracted from the treated cells and used for
electroporation of dendritic cells to generate CML-specific CTL
induction. The cytolytic activity and specificity of the generated
CTLs were determined in standard 51Cr-release assays done after
two restimulations. As target cells, we used dendritic cells
electroporated with RNA from DMSO or imatinib-treated K-562
or K-562R cells. As negative control targets, dendritic cells
electroporated with an EGFP-IVT were used and, to exclude
natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis, K-562 cells were also
included. In addition, to show that the killing is mediated via
HLA class I–restricted CD8+ cells, we included targets that were
preincubated with anti-HLA class I and anti-HLA class II
antibodies, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1A, CTLs generated using total RNA from
DMSO-treated K-562 cells showed effective killing of targets

K-562R cells, but not of dendritic cells transfected with RNA from
imatinib-treated K-562 cells. Similar results were obtained with
CTLs generated using RNA from DMSO-treated K-562R cells as
shown in Fig. 1C. In contrast, using RNA from imatinib-treated
K-562 cells for CTL induction resulted in a total unresponsiveness
of the CTLs (Fig. 1B), whereas treatment of the K-562R cells had
no effect on the generation of CTLs (Fig. 1D). None of the in vitro
induced CTL lines lysed dendritic cells electroporated with RNA
from imatinib-treated K-562 cells. Taken together, these results
indicate that inhibition of BCR-ABL activity by imatinib results in a
strong reduction of the immunogenicity of K-562 cells. To exclude
that the inhibition of T-cell induction resulted from cell death
rather than from reduced BCR-ABL activity, we induced apoptosis
in K-562 cells using etoposide at a concentration of 15 Ag/mL, the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin at 20 Amol/L, as well as g-irradiation of
200 Gy, to achieve a rate of apoptosis of around 40% after 48 h of
treatment. When RNA from these apoptotic cells was used to
induce CTLs, they were fully capable of lysing targets with the
antigenic profile of K-562 cells (data not shown). We next treated

K-562 cells with hydroxyurea at a concentration of 1 mmol/L,
which corresponds to the plasma concentration reached in
patients. After 48 h, this therapeutic agent only induced apoptosis
in 20% of K-562 cells, but led to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase as
seen by a strong increase of the 2N peak and a corresponding
decrease of the 4N peak in Nicoletti staining (data not shown).
CTLs generated using RNA from hydroxyurea-treated cells
specifically lysed targets with the antigenic profile of untreated
K-562 cells, demonstrating that interfering with the cell cycle as
well as inducing apoptosis does not influence the immunogenicity
of CML cells (data not shown).
Specific siRNA directed against BCR-ABL impairs CTL
induction to K-562 antigens. Imatinib is not only effective in
inhibiting BCR-ABL but also affects c-ABL, platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) receptor, and c-KIT kinase activity (27, 28). To
further confirm that the impaired CTL response we observed is due
to direct inhibition of BCR-ABL, we down-regulated BCR-ABL
expression in K-562 and K-562R cells with specific siRNA directed
against the fusion site b3a2 (sib3a2_1) using varying amounts of
siRNA ranging from 120 to 320 pmol per 2  106 cells for
electroporation (Figs. 2A and 3A). To exclude secondary effects like
an IFN response in the treated cells, we included a mismatch

control siRNA (simis) at the same concentrations, as well as a
sequence-unrelated siRNA (siGL2) and nontransfected cells as
controls.
Total RNA extracted from siRNA-transfected K-562 and K-562R
cells was used to electroporate dendritic cells that were then used
as antigen-presenting cells (APC) for CTL induction. As mentioned
above, standard 51Cr-release assays were done to analyze the
cytolytic activity and specificity of the generated CTLs. As target
cells, we used dendritic cells electroporated with RNA from siRNAtransfected K-562 cells. K-562 cells and dendritic cells electroporated with an EGFP-IVT were included as negative controls. As
shown in Fig. 2B, CTLs generated using total RNA from mismatch
control siRNA-transfected (simis-transfected) K-562 cells showed
effective killing of dendritic cells electroporated with RNA from
simis-transfected K-562 cells, whereas they were incapable of
lysing targets presenting antigens from K-562 cells transfected with
BCR-ABL–specific siRNA. HLA class I restriction was proven by
inhibition of target cell lysis with an anti-HLA class I antibody.
The same lysis pattern was observed using CTLs generated using
RNA from simis-transfected K-562R cells, as shown in Fig. 3B.
Moreover, when RNA from K-562 cells, which were transfected
with 0.8 Amol/L of the specific siRNA, was used to generate CTLs,

this resulted in a complete unresponsiveness of the CTLs (Fig. 2C).
Treatment of the K-562R cells with 0.8 Amol/L sib3a2_1 only led to
a reduction in the reactivity of induced CTLs compared with
transfection of these cells with simis (Fig. 3C). When resistant
cells were transfected with 1.6 Amol/L of the specific siRNA,
which corresponds to a down-regulation of the expression of BCRABL to a BCR-ABL/c-ABL ratio achieved in the K-562 cells using
0.8 Amol/L siRNA, specific killing of the induced CTLs was
completely abolished, as shown in Fig. 3D.
In line with the findings from the experiments using imatinib to
inhibit BCR-ABL function, a down-regulation of the kinase
expression by administration of specific siRNA had a similar
effect on CTL induction. Inhibition of the function by downregulation of BCR-ABL kinase expression led to a complete loss of
immunogenicity in K-562 cells, whereas in K-562R cells kinase
inhibition via imatinib did not have a measurable effect.
Detectable reduction of protein levels in these cells by siRNA
resulted in a diminished responsiveness of CTL and a reduction of
the BCR-ABL/c-ABL ratio using higher concentrations of siRNA to
the ratio seen in fully suppressed K-562 cells led to a complete
loss of specific killing.

Influence of imatinib on the expression of tumor antigens.
From the previous experiments, it became evident that imatinibtreated K-562 cells carry an altered antigen profile compared with
DMSO-treated cells. This brought up the question as to which
antigens might be up-regulated by BCR-ABL and therefore be
involved in CTL generation directed against CML cells. We
examined the expression of several tumor antigens that have been
shown to be expressed in CML cells and involved in the recognition
by CTLs, including survivin (15, 29, 30), adipophilin (31), Bcl-2
(32, 33), Bcl-xL (14), hTERT (18), and WT-1 (16). In Western blot
experiments, we were able to show that survivin, adipophilin, Bcl-2,
and Bcl-xL are increasingly down-regulated in K-562 CML cells in
response to treatment with increasing concentrations of imatinib
(Fig. 4A). As we were not able to obtain antibodies suitable for
detection of the antigens WT-1 and hTERT in Western blot, we did
Real-time quantitative PCR experiments and were able to show
that mRNA levels of WT-1 as well as hTERT are also strongly downregulated in K-562 cells by imatinib. Performing the same
experiments with K-562R cells did not lead to obvious changes in
expression levels of the above antigens (Fig. 4B and C). Despite the
strong effect on some proteins, others were not affected by

imatinib. The expression of the xIAP and the phosphatase PTEN,
which opposes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and is
therefore regulating one of the most important pathways activated
by BCR-ABL (34), was not altered in response to imatinib
treatment. It has been described that imatinib causes a reduced
phosphorylation of mTOR, whereas compensatory activation
of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR pathway can be
associated with resistance development in BCR-ABL–positive cells
(34–36). Therefore, we investigated the expression of mTOR in
response to imatinib treatment and found that the overall protein
expression in contrast to phosphorylation levels remained
unchanged (Fig. 4A).
Imatinib reduces the immunogenicity of primary CML cells.
In line with the results above, we were able to detect a reduction of
hTERT in primary CML cells from patients in blast crisis (patients
1 and 2) or chronic phase (patient 3; Fig. 5A). We were able to
obtain enough cells from patient 2 to additionally carry out
Western blot analysis and found a down-regulation of survivin,
whereas Bcl-2 and adipophilin were not detectable (Fig. 5B). These
findings corresponded to a decreased lysis of dendritic cells
electroporated with RNA from imatinib-treated cells from all three
patients in standard 51Cr-release assays compared with the lysis of
dendritic cells electroporated with RNA from DMSO-treated
primary CML cells by CTLs generated using K-562-RNA (Fig. 5C).
Imatinib impairs induction of CTLs specific for several
tumor antigens. To define the reactivity and specificity of the
CTLs generated with K-562-RNA, the effector function of T cells
was analyzed in IFN-g Elispot assays. Autologous dendritic cells
electroporated with IVT coding for several tumor antigens that
have been described to be recognized by CTLs in myeloid
leukemias, such as survivin, PRAME, PR-3, and WT-1, were used

as stimulators. As shown in Fig. 6A, transfection of dendritic cells
with RNA extracted from DMSO-treated K-562 cells resulted in the
induction of T cells that specifically recognized autologous
dendritic cells transfected with K-562-RNA, survivin-IVT, PRAMEIVT, PR-3-IVT, or WT-1-IVT as shown by their secretion of IFN-g.
When RNA extracted from imatinib-treated K-562 cells was used to
transfect dendritic cells used for the generation of CTLs, the
resulting CTLs did not show any reactivity against these antigens
(Fig. 6B).

Discussion
In CML, the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL
fusion protein causes malignant transformation of the CML blasts
through deregulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and adhesion
control pathways. In addition, BCR-ABL represents an antigen
uniquely expressed in these cells and offers the opportunity to be
specifically targeted by drug-based or immunotherapeutic strategies. Imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase activity,
has strongly improved the treatment and outcome of CML
patients. In contrast to CML patients treated with IFN-a, in which
the antileukemic effect in part relies on the induction of T-cell
responses against leukemic cells, it has been recently found that
patients treated with imatinib show impaired CTL responses (37).
This might reflect a negative effect of the drug on the function
of the immune system or be due to a reduced immunogenicity
of the CML cells. Previously, imatinib has been described to
influence the function and differentiation of APCs and inhibit the
effector function of T lymphocytes and might therefore strongly
interfere with immune therapeutic strategies based on dendritic
cell vaccination and the induction of CTL responses in vivo (38–41).

BCR-ABL Influences the Immunogenicity of CML Cells

Figure 5. Expression of antigens in primary CML cells. PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll/Paque density gradient centrifugation of whole blood samples of newly
diagnosed CML patients. Patients 1 and 2 were in blast crisis; patient 3 was in chronic phase. A, real-time PCR analysis showing a down-regulation of hTERT in
primary CML cells. B, Western blot analysis showing a down-regulation of survivin in the cells of patient 2. C, 51Cr-release assay showing the loss of immunogenicity in
imatinib-treated primary CML cells. A CTL line generated using RNA from K-562 cells was used as effectors in this assay.

Here, we show that BCR-ABL activity plays an important role in
the immunogenicity of CML cells as its inhibition by imatinib
impairs the generation of CTLs against CML-associated antigens as
well as their detection by CML-specific CTLs.
Transfection of dendritic cells with RNA isolated from malignant
cells or coding for tumor-associated antigens was recently shown
to be a powerful tool to generate specific T cells with the ability of
recognizing tumor cells (23, 24, 26, 42–44).
To analyze the effects of BCR-ABL inhibition on the expression
of CML-associated antigens, we treated the CML cell line K-562 and
an imatinib-resistant K-562 variant, K-562R, with imatinib or
DMSO and generated CTLs using dendritic cells electroporated
with RNA from these cells. CTLs elicited with RNA from DMSOtreated K-562 cells as well as DMSO- or imatinib-treated K-562R
cells showed a robust cytolytic activity and were able to recognize
several CML-associated antigens, like survivin, PRAME, WT-1, and
PR3, in Elispot assays. CTLs induced using RNA from imatinibtreated K-562 cells were incapable of specific killing of targets with
different CML-associated antigen profiles. To exclude that the
inhibitory effects observed are due to apoptosis and therefore
overall down-regulation of protein synthesis, we additionally used
etoposide, rapamycin, and g-irradiation to induce apoptosis rates
of f40%, which was even higher than achieved with imatinib at
3 Amol/L. CTLs induced using RNA from these cells displayed
a specific killing capacity comparable with CTLs induced using
RNA from DMSO-treated cells. Similarly, the CML therapeutic
hydroxyurea, which leads to a cell cycle arrest, does not impair the
generation of specific CTLs.
Besides BCR-ABL, imatinib inhibits c-KIT and PDGF receptor
kinases. To further prove that the observed effect is mediated by
BCR-ABL inhibition, we used specific siRNA against the BCR-ABL

www.aacrjournals.org

fusion site b3a2 to down-regulate the protein expression and found
essentially the same results.
Although K-562 cells are fully responsive to imatinib when it is
administered in the range of the therapeutic concentration, the
resistance of K-562R cells is at least in part caused by a 2- to 3-fold
overexpression of BCR-ABL. This explains the refractiveness of
these cells to the imatinib concentration used here (19). However,
targeting the expression of the protein directly by specific siRNA
shows that the extent of down-regulation achieved with specific
siRNA correlates with the effect on CTL inducibility. When using
0.8 Amol/L, the less pronounced down-regulation compared
with K-562 cells evokes an impairment of CTL induction, whereas
a concentration leading to a similar BCR-ABL/c-ABL ratio as in
K-562 cells also has a similar detrimental effect on the induction of
specific CTLs.
Taken together, these results indicate that the expression and
activity of BCR-ABL activity directly determine the immunogenicity
of CML cells. This supports the assumption that BCR-ABL activity
might mediate the up-regulation of immunogenic antigens and
that its inhibition, in turn, leads to the corresponding reduction of
their expression.
To confirm and expand these studies, we analyzed the
expression of antigens connected to immune responses to CML
in imatinib-treated cells using Western blotting and real-time PCR.
We found that imatinib-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL leads to
a decreased expression of tumor antigens and cellular proteins,
including survivin, adipophilin, hTERT, WT-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2
in correlation to a decreased development of specific CTLs, whereas the expression levels of several other proteins remained
unchanged. In line with the previous results, the down-regulation
effects were not observed in K-562R cells. Similarly, in primary CML

Figure 6. Elispot assays showing the
reactivity of CTLs to different antigens.
The specificity of the CTLs generated as
described above was determined after
three weekly restimulations in an IFN-g
Elispot assay. A, induction of CTLs with
dendritic cells electroporated with
K-562-DMSO-RNA leads to a strong
reactivity against survivin-, PRAME-,
WT1- , and PR3 -IVT. B, CTLs induced with
dendritic cells electroporated with RNA
from imatinib-treated K-562 show no

cells subjected to imatinib, a down-regulation of hTERT and
survivin could be detected, which also corresponded to a decreased
lysis of dendritic cells electroporated with RNA from these cells in
standard 51Cr-release assays.
It has been shown before that survivin expression is regulated
through BCR-ABL downstream cascades and that survivin is critical
for the survival of BCR-ABL–positive cells (15). We were able to show
that it is also involved in the recognition of CML cells by CTLs.
The down-regulation in K-562 cells as well as in primary cells after
imatinib treatment matched the missing recognition of targets
carrying the antigen profiles of these cells by CTLs recognizing K-562
antigens in 51Cr-release as well as Elispot assays. However, other
tumor-associated antigens that have not been investigated in this
study might contribute to the immunogenicity of CML cells.
Our results point out that BCR-ABL is critical for the
immunogenicity of CML cells as the inhibition of its activity by
imatinib as well as a reduction of its expression by specific siRNA
lead to a loss of inducibility of specific CTL responses. This might

be due to down-regulation of immunogenic antigens that are
up-regulated by the uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity.
As the concentrations used here are in the range of plasma levels
of treated patients, imatinib treatment could therefore interfere
with immunotherapeutic approaches due to an inhibition of CTL
responses as well as the lacking recognition of the CML cells by
specific CTLs.
