Abstract
Expression of the nuclear receptor interacting factor 3
(NRIF3) coregulator in a wide variety of breast cancer cells
selectively leads to rapid caspase-2–dependent apoptotic cell
death. A novel death domain (DD1) was mapped to a 30–
amino acid region of NRIF3. Because the cytotoxicity of NRIF3
and DD1 seems to be cell type–specific, these studies suggest
that breast cancer cells contain a novel ‘‘death switch’’ that
can be specifically modulated by NRIF3 or DD1. Using an MCF7 cell cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we cloned a
factor that mediates apoptosis by DD1 and refer to this factor
as DD1-interacting factor-1 (DIF-1). DIF-1 is a transcriptional
repressor that mediates its effect through SirT1, and this
repression is attenuated by the binding of NRIF3/DD1. DIF-1
expression rescues breast cancer cells from NRIF3/DD1induced apoptosis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown
of DIF-1 selectively leads to apoptosis of breast cancer cells,
further suggesting that DIF-1 plays a key role in NRIF3/DD1mediated apoptosis. A protein kinase A inhibitor (H89) also
elicits apoptosis of breast cancer cells but not of the other cell
types examined, and DIF-1 also protects these cells from H89mediated apoptosis. In addition, H89 incubation results in a
rapid increase in NRIF3 levels and siRNA knockdown of NRIF3
protects breast cancer cells from H89-mediated apoptosis. Our
results indicate that DIF-1 plays a key role in breast cancer cell
survival and further characterizing this pathway may provide
important insights into developing novel therapies to selectively target breast cancer cells for apoptosis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a fundamental process in
growth and development and is targeted in the treatment of
various tumors. Apoptosis is mediated through activation of
‘‘initiator’’ caspases (e.g., caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-9, and
caspase-10), which then cleave and activate ‘‘effector’’ caspases
(e.g., caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7; refs. 1, 2), leading to
cleavage of a wide variety of protein components in the cell. We
have been interested in understanding the mechanism of retinoidmediated inhibition of breast cancer cell growth (3, 4). We
previously examined the role of a nuclear hormone receptor

coactivator we cloned from HeLa cells [nuclear receptor interacting factor 3 (NRIF3); Fig. 1A] on the retinoid inhibition of growth
(3, 4) of several breast cancer cell lines (5). Unlike HeLa cells, we
found that NRIF3 expression in breast cancer cell lines rapidly
leads to an apoptosis (within 5 hours of expression) independent of
retinoid incubation (5, 6). The region of NRIF3-mediating apoptosis
was mapped to amino acids 20 to 50, and we refer to this region as
death domain-1 (DD1; Fig. 1A; refs. 5, 6). Caspase inhibitor and
small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies indicated that DD1-mediated
apoptosis resulted from activation of caspase-2 (5, 6). Ser28 is
important for apoptosis because change of Ser28 to Ala28 abrogates
the ability of DD1 to mediate apoptosis (5, 6). This effect of NRIF3
or DD1 seems selective for breast cancer cells because expression
of DD1 in a wide variety of cell lines derived from other cell types,
in addition to HeLa cells, did not lead to cell death (5, 6).
These findings suggest that breast cancer cells contain a novel
‘‘death switch’’ that is specifically triggered by NRIF3/DD1. To
understand how NRIF3/DD1 expression leads to apoptosis in
breast cancer cells, we screened an MCF-7 breast cancer cell
cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid screen and LexA-DD1 as
bait. We identified a previously described factor (IRF-2BP2A) that
had been suggested to mediate the repressive effect of IRF-2 on
IRF-2–modulated genes (7). In this study, we show that IRF-2BP2A
is an important target for DD1-mediated apoptosis, and thus, we
refer to this factor in this article as DD1-interacting factor-1 (DIF1; Fig. 1A). DIF-1 harbors an NH2 terminal zinc finger and COOH
terminal RING-like finger, suggesting that it might function as an
E3 ubiquitin or SUMO ligase, although in vivo and in vitro studies
have not provided evidence for this. We found, however, that DIF1 functions as a transcriptional repressor that mediates its effect
through SirT1 and the repressive activity of DIF-1 is blocked by
NRIF3. Additional evidence that DIF-1 plays a central role in
NRIF3/DD1-mediated apoptosis are as follows: (a) change of Ser28
in DD1 to Ala28 abrogates the apoptogenic effect of DD1 and this
mutation eliminates the binding of DD1 to DIF-1; (b) expression
of DIF-1 blocks DD1-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells;
and (c) RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of DIF-1 in a wide
variety of breast cancer cells (but not other cell types) leads to
apoptosis.
These observations suggest that DIF-1 functions as an ‘‘antiapoptotic’’ factor and ‘‘inhibition’’ of its activity through NRIF3/
DD1 binding or RNAi knockdown leads to apoptosis. Because
NRIF3/DD1 expression or RNAi knockdown of DIF-1 seems to
specifically lead to apoptosis of breast cancer cells, this pathway
may provide important insights to develop novel therapies to
selectively target breast cancer cells for apoptosis.

Figure 1. Structure, domains, and interaction of NRIF3 and DIF-1. A, the
domain structure of NRIF3 has been described previously (8). The DD1 region
sufficient to mediate apoptosis (amino acids 20–50) is shown along with Ser28,
which is essential to mediate apoptosis. DIF-1 contains an NH2 terminal zinc
finger and a COOH terminal RING-like finger. DD1 interacts with DIF-1 through
the RING-like finger. B and C, NRIF3/DD1 interacts with DIF-1 in yeast and
mammalian cells. B, LexA-NRIF3, LexA-DD1, and LexA-DD1(S28A) were
expressed in yeast along with a LexA-driven LacZ reporter (pSH18-34) and
pJG4-5 conditionally expressing DIF-1 with a B42 activation domain.
Shown are LacZ results where B42-DIF-1 was conditionally expressed
by galactose. LexA-NRIF3 and LexA-DD1 interact with DIF-1, whereas
LexA-DD1(S28A) exhibited little or no interaction. B, HeLa cells were transfected
with pLPC-DIF-1 or the control pLPC vector along with pcDNA3.1 expressing
NRIF3. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed and incubated overnight with
FLAG-antibody (M2) agarose beads. The protein bound to the beads was
analyzed by Western blotting with NRIF3 antibody.

LexA-DD1(S28A) were constructed by PCR of DD1 and DD1(S28A) from
GFP-DD1 and GFP-DD1(S28A) vectors (5) and cloning the PCR-generated
fragments into pEG202. An MCF-7 cDNA library (estrogen treated) in pJG4-5
was obtained from Origene. All methods and transformation procedures
have been described previously (9). Because DD1(S28A) does not lead to
apoptosis of breast cancer cells, an MCF-7 cell expressed protein from
pJG4-5, which interacts with LexA-DD1 but not LexA-DD1(S28A), would be
considered a candidate target of DD1 in breast cancer cells. One such clone
was identified, which expressed 102 amino acids of the COOH terminal
region, including the RING-like finger of a previously identified clone,
IRF-2BP2A (7). In this study, we refer to IRF-2BP2A as DIF-1.
Yeast B-galactosidase assays. Details are given in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Plasmids. Details on the construction of DIF-1 and other expression
vectors are given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell culture and DNA transfection. HeLa cells and other cells, which
were not derived from mammary epithelium, were routinely maintained in
DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum supplemented with glutamine
and antibiotics. The various breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, SKBR3,
MDA-435, and MDA-231) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics. For the
reporter gene studies, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 100,000 to
150,000 cells per well, and the medium was replaced with DMEM containing

resin-charcoal–treated bovine calf serum (10) before transfection. Transfections were performed with the amount of Gal4-chimeric vectors
indicated in the figure legends using calcium phosphate coprecipitation.
Typically, 100 ng of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter
plasmid pG5-SV-BCAT was used. This reporter contains five GAL4responsive binding sites cloned upstream of the SV40 early promoter
linked to the CAT gene (11). All transfections were performed in duplicate
or triplicate. CAT activity was determined as previously described (12). In
certain experiments, 150 ng/mL Trichostatin A (TSA; classes I and II HDAC
inhibitor) or 50 nmol/L nicotimamide (a class III HDAC inhibitor) or
1 Amol/L resveratrol (a SirT1 agonist) was added 1 h before transfection.
TUNEL assay. Breast cancer cell lines were plated at a density of 3  104
cells per well (250 AL medium) on glass coverslips in 48-well tissue culture
plates. About 20 h later, the cells were transfected with indicated plasmid(s)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Generally, the amount of plasmid
used in transfections was 25 to 50 ng for GFP-DD1. In ‘‘rescue’’ experiments,
cells were transfected with 100 ng of pLPC or pLPC-DIF-1. Twenty-four
hours later, the cells were transfected with 50 ng of GFP-DD1 and then
harvested 5 h later for TUNEL assay (In situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR
red; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Cells were also stained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei, mounted on slides, examined by
fluorescent microscopy, and digitally imaged.
siRNA transfection. siRNA sequences and transfection conditions are
given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were transfected with pLPC-DIF1 or
the pLPC control vector along with a pcDNA3.1 vector-expressing untagged
NRIF3. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed with isotonic saline
and lysed in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L KCl,
0.25% NP40, and 1 mmol/L DTT; Roche mini-complete protease inhibitor].
After a freeze-thaw cycle, the samples were centrifuged and the cell extracts
were incubated with FLAG-M2-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4jC for 15 h. The
beads were then washed, and NRIF3 bound to FLAG-HA-DIF-1 immobilized
on the FLAG-M2-agarose beads was identified by Western blotting with
NRIF3 antibody.
DNA-cellulose binding. Conditions for the binding of cell extracted DIF1 are given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
Identification of DIF-1 as an interactor of DD1 and NRIF3
through a yeast two-hybrid screen. We used a yeast two-hybrid
screen to identify candidate factors that might interact with
NRIF3/DD1 to mediate apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Because
DD1 of NRIF3 is sufficient to mediate apoptosis, we expressed DD1
as a LexA fusion in yeast and screened a pJG4-5 MCF-7 cell cDNA
library. DD1(S28A) does not lead to apoptosis and any candidate
factors identified with LexA-DD1 were rescreened with LexADD1(S28A). One of the clones that interacted with DD1, but not
DD1(S28A), was IRF-2BP2A, which we refer to as DIF-1. The clone
contained only the COOH terminal RING-like finger region
(Fig. 1A) indicating that DD1 associates with the RING-like finger
of DIF-1. A full-length clone of DIF-1 was generated and then
cloned into (a) pJG4-5 for yeast interaction studies, (b) pLPC to
generate NH2 terminal FLAG and HA tags for expression in
mammalian cells, and (c) pEGFP-C3 for cell fluorescent studies.
Full-length DIF-1 contains a predicted NH2 terminal zinc finger and
a COOH terminal RING-like finger (Fig. 1A).
DIF-1 interacts with NRIF3/DD1 in yeast and mammalian
cells. Figure 1B compares the yeast interaction (h-galactosidase
activity) of LexA-DD1, LexA-DD1(S28A), and LexA-NRIF3 with fulllength DIF-1 conditionally expressed with galactose from pJG4-5.
DIF-1 did not interact with LexA-DD1(S28A), whereas DIF-1
interacted strongly with LexA-DD1 or LexA-NRIF3. These interactions parallel the apoptogenic potential of these peptides. To

NRIF3-Mediated Apoptosis in Breast Cancer

provide evidence that DIF-1 and NRIF3 interact in mammalian
cells, HeLa cells were transfected with a vector expressing NRIF3
and with a pLPC vector expressing FLAG-HA–tagged DIF-1 or a
control pLPC FLAG-HA vector. Twenty-four hours later, the cells
were lysed, the extracts were incubated with FLAG-antibody(M2)
immobilized on agarose beads, and the protein associated with the
beads was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). The Western blot
from cells expressing FLAG-HA–tagged DIF-1 detected NRIF3
(f21 kDa) whereas no immunoreactive NRIF3 was found with the
pLPC vector control.
DIF-1 is a nuclear protein. NRIF3 is a nuclear protein, and
expression of GFP-DIF-1 in T-47D breast cancer cells indicates that
DIF-1 is also a nuclear protein (Fig. 2A). Similar results were found
with GFP-DIF-1 in HeLa cells (not shown). In addition, DIF-1 or
components of a DIF-1 complex can bind to DNA-cellulose. FLAGHA–tagged DIF-1 was expressed in T-47D cells and HeLa cells.
Nuclear extracts (0.3 mol/L KCl) were bound to FLAG-antibody(M2) beads, washed, and eluted with FLAG peptide. The eluted
fraction was incubated with DNA-cellulose or with just cellulose.
The samples were washed and DIF-1 bound analyzed by Western
blotting using FLAG-M2 antibody. Figure 2B shows that DIF-1, or a
complex containing DIF-1, bound to DNA-cellulose but not the
cellulose control.
DIF-1 is a transcriptional repressor whose activity is
blocked by NRIF3. IRF-2BP2A linked to the yeast Gal4 DNAbinding domain (DBD) was reported to show repression of a Gal4
reporter gene (7). To further examine this, we constructed a vector
expressing a chimera of the Gal4-DBD and DIF-1 (Gal4-DIF-1).
Expression of Gal4-DIF-1 in either HeLa or breast cancer cells leads
to the marked repression of a Gal4-CAT reporter gene (Fig. 2C). To
assess whether this repression is modulated by NRIF3, we
expressed Gal4-DIF-1 at low levels in HeLa cells (which endoge-

nously express NRIF3) and asked if repression by Gal4-DIF-1 was
enhanced when NRIF3 was knocked down by NRIF3 siRNA. Figure
2D shows that low-level expression of Gal4-DIF-1 leads to
incomplete transcriptional repression whereas knockdown of
NRIF3 markedly enhances the level of repression by Gal4-DIF-1.
Repression mediated by DIF-1 seems to involve class III
histone deacetylases. To assess the role of histone deacetylases
(HDAC) in mediating repression by DIF-1, we examined the effect
of TSA, a class I and class II HDAC inhibitor, and nicotinamide, a
reversible inhibitor of the sirtuins, which are class III NAD+dependent protein HDACs (13–15). Figure 3A shows that TSA
minimally reverses Gal4-DIF-1–mediated repression whereas this
repression is fully reversed by nicotinamide. Because both SirT1
and DIF-1 are nuclear proteins, we considered SirT1 as a potential
candidate to mediate repression by DIF-1. To further explore this,
we examined the effect of knockdown of SirT1 by siRNA on
repression by DIF-1. Knockdown of SirT1 (f60% to 70% estimated
by Western blotting) reversed repression mediated by DIF-1
(Fig. 3B). Further evidence that DIF-1–mediated repression occurs
through SirT1 is supported by the finding that DIF-1–mediated
repression is enhanced by resveratrol, a SirT1 agonist (Fig. 3B; ref.
16). Although resveratrol may have other targets, such as AMP
kinase (17), enhancement of repression by resveratrol along with
reversal of repression by SirT1 knockdown supports the notion that
SirT1 mediates the repressive effects of DIF-1.
DD1-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells is blocked by
A-amanitin. The finding that DIF-1 is a transcriptional repressor,
which is inactivated by NRIF3 or DD1, suggests that DIF-1 might
repress one or more proapoptotic genes in breast cancer cells. To
provide further support for this notion, we examined whether
inhibition of RNA polymerase II by a-amanitin blocks DD1mediated apoptosis. a-Amanitin does not rapidly enter cells and,

Figure 2. DIF-1 is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA-cellulose and mediates transcriptional repression. A, GFP-DIF-1 expressed in T-47D cells localizes to the
nucleus. B, HeLa and T-47D cells expressing FLAG-HA tagged DIF-1 were lysed in 0.3 mol/L KCl buffer. The supernatants were bound to FLAG antibody beads and
then eluted with 3 FLAG peptide. Samples were incubated with DNA-cellulose (DNA-Cell) or with cellulose control (Con-Cell ), and after washing, the cellulose beads
were analyzed for DIF-1 by Western blotting with FLAG antibody. The input represents 5% of the sample before the binding assay. C, HeLa or T-47D cells were
transfected with 100 ng of the pG5-SV-BCAT reporter along with 200 ng of vector expressing Gal4-DIF-1 or 150 ng (equal molar amount of plasmid) expressing only the
Gal4 DBD. CAT activity was analyzed 30 h later. Gal4-DIF-1 represses the Gal4-CAT reporter in both cell types. D, HeLa cells were transfected as indicated with an
NRIF3 siRNA (25 nmol/L) or a control-siRNA (25 nmol/L). Thirty hours later, the cells were transfected with 100 ng of pG5-SV-BCAT alone and with 50 ng of the
Gal4-DIF-1 vector. CAT activity was determined 30 h later.

Figure 3. Repression by DIF-1 is mediated by SirT1. A, T-47D cells were transfected with 100 ng of pG5-SV-BCAT and 200 ng of vector expressing Gal4-DIF-1.
One hour before transfection, cells received either TSA (150 ng/mL), nicotinamide (50 nmol/L), or no treatment. Thirty hours later, the cells were harvested for CAT
activity. B, T-47D cells were transfected with a SirT1 siRNA (25 nmol/L) or a control-siRNA (25 nmol/L). Before introduction of the siRNAs, cells were incubated with
20 Amol/L zVDVAD-fmk, a caspase-2 inhibitor, to prevent apoptosis that might occur as a result of knockdown of SirT1. Thirty hours after introduction of the siRNAs, the
cells were transfected with 100 ng of the pG5-SV-BCAT reporter alone and with 150 ng of the Gal4-DIF-1 expression vector. Another set of cells did not receive
siRNA but received 1 Amol/L resveratrol before transfection with 50 ng of the Gal4-DIF-1 vector. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were analyzed for CAT activity.

depending on the concentration and cell type, has its effect after
5 to 6 hours of incubation. We took advantage of this by first
incubating half of the cultured wells of T-47D cells with 2.5 umol/L
a-amanitin 3 hours before transfection with a GFP-DD1 vector.
This allowed for synthesis of these proteins, which seem stable as
assessed by GFP fluorescence. Twenty hours later, cells were
analyzed for GFP expression and for apoptosis by TUNEL assay
(Fig. 4A). Incubation with a-amanitin does not lead to apoptosis,
but it inhibits the ability of DD1 to mediate apoptosis (Fig. 4A,
bottom left). Although there are likely a number of explanations for
this finding, the results are consistent with DIF-1 acting to repress a
proapoptotic gene(s) in breast cancer cells, which when expressed
leads to apoptosis.
siRNA knockdown of DIF-1 leads to apoptosis of breast
cancer cells but not cells of other origin. NRIF3/DD1 might lead
to apoptosis of breast cancer cells via DIF-1 by two general
mechanisms. One proposes that DIF-1 is activated by NRIF3/DD1
to initiate an apoptotic pathway whereas the second is that DIF-1
acts as an antiapoptotic factor whose activity is interfered with by
NRIF3/DD1. The findings in Fig. 2D support the second hypothesis.
To further distinguish between these two general potential
mechanisms, five different breast cancer cell lines were studied
(SKBR3, MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-435, and MDA-231). We also
examined MCF10A cells, which exhibit characteristics of normal
breast epithelium, do not form tumors in nude mice, and lack
anchorage-independent growth (18). The breast cancer cell lines
and MCF10A cells were transfected with an siRNA that targets DIF1 mRNA, whereas a control group received an siRNA containing

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

four base changes. MCF10A cells showed no evidence for apoptosis,
whereas all the breast cancer cell lines exhibited apoptosis (Fig. 4B
and D). Because of space considerations, the results are only shown
for SKBR3 in Fig. 4B. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the results for
MCF-7, T-47D, MDA-435, and MDA-231 cells. Parallel studies were
carried out with other cell types (U2OS, human osteosarcoma; 293,
human kidney epithelium; UOK-145, kidney carcinoma; HepG2,
human hepatoma; HeLa, human cervical epithelium). These cells
did not undergo apoptosis and, for space consideration, are only
shown for HeLa in Fig. 4B. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the results
for U2OS, 293, UOK-145, and HepG2. Supplementary Fig. S2A shows
that DIF-1 siRNA efficiently knocks down FLAG-HA–tagged DIF-1
(f90%) whereas the DIF-1 siRNA mutant (control) was without
effect. Similar results were found for HeLa cells expressing FLAGHA–tagged DIF-1 (not illustrated). The DIF-1 siRNA mutant did not
lead to apoptosis in the breast cancer cell lines. Three other DIF-1
siRNAs (see Materials and Methods) also selectively led to
apoptosis of the breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly, transfection
with DIF-1 siRNA does not lead to apoptosis of MCF10A cells
(Fig. 4D). Knockdown of DIF-1 in HeLa and the other nonbreast
cancer lines does not lead to apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting that breast cancer cells have the potential to selectively
express a proapoptotic factor(s) that is(are) functionally inactivated
by DIF-1 or whose expression is repressed by DIF-1.
That normal MCF10A cells do not undergo apoptosis when
transfected with DIF-1 siRNA was an intriguing finding. Thus, we
examined whether expression of GFP-DD1 leads to apoptosis of
MCF10A cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, unlike the breast cancer cell

NRIF3-Mediated Apoptosis in Breast Cancer

lines (Supplementary Fig. S3), expression of DD1 does not lead to
apoptosis of MCF10A cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting that there is
something intrinsic to breast cancer cells and not just breast
epithelial cells that sensitizes them to apoptosis. To further explore
this possibility, we examined two mouse breast cancer cell lines
(4T1 and 67NR; ref. 19) and a mouse mammary cell line (C57MG)
derived from C57BL/6 mouse normal mammary epithelium (20).
Expression of GFP-DD1 leads to apoptosis of 4T1 and 67NR cells
but not C57MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), further suggesting
that breast cancer cells are selectively sensitized to DD1-mediated
apoptosis.
DIF-1 rescues breast cancer cells from DD1-mediated
apoptosis and protects cells from H89-mediated apoptosis.
Our results suggest that NRIF3/DD1 mediate their apoptotic effects
by targeting DIF-1. A prediction of this conclusion is that further
expression of DIF-1 might be expected to rescue breast cancer cells
from DD1-mediated apoptosis. Figure 5A (rows 1 and 2) shows that
DIF-1 expression rescues cells from DD1-mediated apoptosis. We
explored whether DIF-1 might play a role in abrogating apoptosis
of breast cancer cells initiated by other factors. Protein kinase A
(PKA) plays an antiapoptotic role in breast cancer cells (21), and we
found that the PKA inhibitor H89 rapidly leads to apoptosis
(Fig. 5A, rows 3 and 4). GFP-DIF-1 was used to express DIF-1 in
T-47D cells, whereas control cells received a control GFP-NLS
vector. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were incubated with or
without 200 nmol/L H89 for 5 hours followed by analysis by TUNEL
assay. DIF-1 protected the T-47D cells from apoptosis within
5 hours of H89 incubation (Fig. 5A, rows 3 and 4), as well as after
24 hours of exposure (not illustrated). Similar findings with H89

were found with all breast cancer cell lines studied, whereas H89
did not mediate apoptosis in other cell types of different origin as
described earlier (U2OS, 293, UOK-145, HepG2, and HeLa; not
illustrated).
Apoptosis mediated by H89 in breast cancer cells results
from the rapid induction of NRIF3. The finding that DIF-1
rescues breast cancer cells from H89-mediated and NRIF3/DD1mediated apoptosis suggests that H89 leads to apoptosis through a
rapid increase in NRIF3, which targets DIF-1. Figure 5B shows
that T-47D cells express very low levels of NRIF3 and that H89
incubation leads to a rapid increase in NRIF3 levels. Similar results
were found for H89 and NRIF3 mRNA using quantitative reverse
transcription–PCR (RT-PCR; Supplementary Fig. S5). Apoptosis is
inhibited by siRNA knockdown of NRIF3 24 hours before addition
of H89 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that NRIF3 mediates the rapid
apoptotic response elicited by H89 in breast cancer cells.
Supplementary Fig. S2B documents that the NRIF3 siRNA leads
to knockdown of NRIF3. This finding raises the possibility that
modulation of endogenous NRIF3 may play a role in the initiation
of apoptosis in breast cancer cells by a variety of factors. Although
HeLa cells express NRIF3, H89 incubation does not increase the
levels of NRIF3 (Western blotting, not shown) or NRIF3 mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

Discussion
In this study, we identified DIF-1 (IRF-2BP2A) as a potent
antiapoptotic factor in a wide variety of breast cancer cell lines, but
not in cell lines derived from other tissues. NRIF3/DD1 interacts

Figure 4. Effect of a-amanitin on DD1-mediated apoptosis and knockdown of DIF-1 by siRNA leads to apoptosis of breast cancer cells. A, T-47D cells were incubated
with or without a-amanitin (2.5 Amol/L) for 3 h and then transfected with vector (100 ng) to express GFP-DD1. Twenty hours later, the cells were analyzed for GFP-DD1
expression and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Shown are representative fields. No apoptosis was identified in cells preincubated with a-amanitin and the levels of GFPDD1 were similar under both conditions. B, siRNA (25 nmol/L) was used to knockdown DIF-1 expression in five different breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3, MCF-7,
T-47D, MDA-435, and MDA-231) or cells of other origin (U2OS, human osteosarcoma; 293, human kidney epithelium; UOK-145, kidney carcinoma; HepG2, human
hepatoma; HeLa, human cervical epithelium). A control siRNA (25 nmol/L) contained four base changes (mut siRNA ). Thirty hours later, cells were examined for
apoptosis by TUNEL assay. All the breast cancer cell lines exhibited apoptosis, whereas the other cells did not. Shown are representative results from the study with
SKBR3 breast cancer cells and HeLa cells. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows results with the other cell lines. Similar results were found with four different siRNAs that
targeted DIF-1 mRNA. C, expression of DD1 (GFP-DD1 ) does not lead to apoptosis of MCF10A cells, a cell line derived from normal breast epithelial cells. D, DIF-1
siRNA does not lead to apoptosis of MCF10A cells.

with DIF-1 (Fig. 1B and C) and modulates DIF-1 activity (Fig. 2D),
suggesting that DIF-1 is the target of NRIF3/DD1 that mediates
apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Additional evidence that DIF-1 is
the target of NRIF3/DD1 in mediating apoptosis comes from
studies indicating that (a) DD1(S28A) does not interact with DIF-1
and does not lead to apoptosis, (b) expression of DIF-1 abrogates
NRIF3/DD1-mediated apoptosis, and (c) siRNA knockdown of
DIF-1 leads to apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines but not lines
derived from other cell types.
IRF-2BP2A was initially cloned in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a
factor that mediated the repressive effects of IRF-2 (7). The
mechanism of this repression was not defined, although repression
was not reversed by TSA, a class I and class II HDAC inhibitor. In
this study, we found that DIF-1 is a potent transcriptional
repressor, and this effect seems to be mediated by SirT1, a class
III NAD+-dependent histone and protein deacetylase. Evidence
supporting that DIF-1 acts through SirT1 comes from the findings
that DIF-1 repression is reversed by siRNA knockdown of SirT1 and
is enhanced by resveratrol, a SirT1 agonist (Fig. 3B). Although SirT1
has been identified with N-CoR/SMRT corepressors (22), which
interact with class I or class II HDACs, our TSA findings do not
support that class I or class II HDACs significantly mediate the
repressive effects of DIF-1. The finding that DIF-1 or a component
of the DIF-1 complex binds DNA (Fig. 2) suggests that DIF-1 via
SirT1 may act to affect histone acetylation or other chromatin

modifications (15) or deacetylation of other transcription factors
(13–15).
NRIF3 seems to inhibit repression mediated by DIF-1 because
knockdown of endogenous NRIF3 in HeLa cells leads to enhanced
DIF-1–mediated repression (Fig. 2D). In this regard, H89-mediated
apoptosis in breast cancer cells seems to result from a rapid
increase in NRIF3 levels, which would interact with and modify the
activity of DIF-1. How H89 rapidly induces NRIF3 is unknown, but
the rapidity of the response at both the mRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S5) and protein level (Fig. 5B) suggests that NRIF3 acts as a
‘‘stress’’ response gene that may determine cell fate in a cell type–
specific manner. Interestingly, a-amanitin, a polymerase II inhibitor,
blocks DD1-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Fig. 4A).
Taken together, our findings suggest that DIF-1 acts to repress one
or more proapoptotic genes in breast cancer cells and the binding of
NRIF3/DD1 to DIF-1 in breast cancer cells reverses repression and
leads to the expression of these proapoptotic genes (Fig. 6).
Because expression of NRIF3/DD1 seems to selectively lead to
apoptosis in breast cancer cells, we examined the relative mRNA
levels of NRIF3 and DIF-1 by quantitative RT-PCR in the cell lines
used in this study. All breast cancer cell lines expressed f5-fold to
10-fold less NRIF3 mRNA than HeLa and 293 cells. U2OS and
MCF10A cells expressed f3-fold less NRIF3 mRNA than HeLa cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Supplementary Fig. S7 indicates that (a)
HeLa, 293, SKBR3, and MCF-7 cells express similar amounts of

Figure 5. DIF-1 rescues breast cancer cells from DD1-mediated and H89-mediated apoptosis. A, T-47D cells were transfected with 100 ng pLPC-DIF-1. Other
cells were transfected with control pLPC vector. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with 50 ng of GFP-DD1 vector. Five hours later, cells were analyzed
for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Shown are represented fields. Expression of DIF-1 decreased DD1-mediated apoptosis by over 90%. For the H89 study, T-47D cells
were transfected with GFP-DIF-1 vector (100 ng) or with a vector expressing GFP containing a nuclear localization signal (GFP-NLS ; 75 ng). Twenty-four hours later,
the cells received 200 nmol/L of H89, a PKA inhibitor. Five hours later, the cells were examined for apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Shown are representative fields.
Expression of DIF-1 resulted in a >90% reduction in apoptosis mediated by H89. B, H89 mediates apoptosis in breast cancer cells through NRIF3. T-47D cells were
treated with a NRIF3 siRNA (25 nmol/L) or with a control siRNA (25 nmol/L). Thirty hours later, the cells received 200 nmol/L H89. Cells were harvested for NRIF3
expression by Western blotting 2, 4, and 6 h after addition of H89. Cells were also examined for apoptosis by TUNEL assay 5 h after H89 incubation. H89 incubation
results in a rapid increase in NRIF3. NRIF3 siRNA blocked the rapid H89-mediated increase in NRIF3 expression, as well as apoptosis. Supplementary Fig. S5
indicates that this rapid increase in NRIF3 occurs at the mRNA level.

NRIF3-Mediated Apoptosis in Breast Cancer

Figure 6. Mechanism by which NRIF3/DD1 and DIF-1 regulate apoptosis of
breast cancer cells. The figure depicts a model that is consistent with our findings
that DIF-1 is a transcriptional repressor that can bind DNA whose activity is
reversed by NRIF3/DD1 and that preincubation with a-amanitin blocks
DD1-mediated apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that one or
more proapoptotic genes bind to and are repressed by DIF-1 in breast cancer
cells. Expression of NRIF3/DD1 binds DIF-1 and mediates a conformational
change that reverses its ability to act as a repressor. We do not know whether the
NRIF3/DIF-1 complex remains bound to the proapoptotic gene(s) or whether
the binding of NRIF3/DD1 to DIF-1 results in a dissociation of DIF-1 from the
proapoptotic gene. By either mechanism, reversal of repression of one or more
proapoptotic genes leads to gene expression and the initiation of apoptosis.

cell types. Very few studies have examined the role of SirT1 on
mammary epithelium or breast cancer. Knockout of the SirT1 gene
identified an abnormality in mammary gland development (23),
whereas another study noted that the SirT1 inhibitor Sirtinol leads
to growth arrest of MCF-7 cells, although apoptosis was not
examined (24). In addition, siRNA knockdown of SirT1 leads to
apoptosis or senescence of epithelial-derived tumor cells, including
MCF-7 (25).
Although DIF-1 seems to repress through SirT1, its antiapoptotic
activity is not fully reproduced when we knocked down SirT1 in
breast cancer cells. Thus, knockdown of SirT1 by siRNA in T-47D
cells leads to 30% of the cells exhibiting apoptosis1 compared with
knockdown of DIF-1 or expression of DD1/NRIF3 (>90%). Although
this might suggest that DIF-1 acts as an antiapoptotic factor via a
mechanism independent of SirT1, the extent of knockdown of
SirT1 (f60–70%) is less than that found for DIF-1 (>90%). In
addition, if DIF-1 selectively repressed one or more proapoptotic
genes, knockdown of DIF-1 would be expected to have a greater
effect than knockdown of SirT1, unless knockdown of SirT1 was
complete. Preliminary studies indicate that DIF-1 is part of a large
nuclear protein complex.2 Identification of the proteins that
interact with DIF-1 may shed light on why the antiapoptotic
function of DIF-1 seems selective for breast cancer cells.
Irrespective of the mechanism by which DIF-1 functions, our
studies indicate that DIF-1 is a novel factor that can act as a death
switch that plays a central and specific role in determining whether
breast cancer cells survive or undergo programmed cell death.

DIF-1 mRNA whereas U2OS cells express 7-fold less, (b) T-47D cells
express 2-fold less, and (c) MCF10A cells express 2-fold higher DIF1 mRNA levels. The increase in DIF-1 in MCF10A cells does not
likely account for their resistance to DD1-mediated apoptosis
because the 67NR and 4T1 cells express 5-fold to 10-fold higher
levels and exhibit DD1-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, DIF-1
mRNA levels in the DD1-resistant C57MG cells is similar to that
found in 67NR cells, suggesting that differences in DIF-1 expression
does not account for the difference in response of the 67NR tumor
cells and the normal C57MG breast epithelial cells.
The specificity of the DIF-1 pathway in mediating apoptosis in
breast cancer cells suggests that genes, which are silenced in breast
cancer cells by DIF-1, are silenced by other mechanisms in other
