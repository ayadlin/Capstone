Summary
Variation in a genomic region that contains the cancer-a ssociated gene ATM affects a patient’s
response to the diabetes drug metformin. Two experts discuss the implications for understanding
diabetes and the link to cancer.

A clue to metformin action, Morris J. Birnbaum
Let me start on a positive note. The genetic association between ATM and metformin
sensitivity1 represents a triumph of modern pharmacogenetics, and it is reasonable to hope
that it will lead to fundamental insights into metformin’s mechanism of action and the
regulation of carbohydrate metabolism.
You might ask how a rare variation linked to ATM could possibly be related to the treatment
of a common disease such as diabetes. After all, given the prevalence of diabetes, it would
be reasonable to assume that it takes only slight disruptions in nutritional intake or energy
expenditure to shift the balance between health and metabolic disease.

This is in fact far from the truth. To contract an illness with the serious consequences of type
2 diabetes, not only must there be disturbances in energy balance, but the normal
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate metabolism must also be impaired. In other words, if
the regulatory system fails to respond to caloric overload, disease ensues. With the relative
uniformity of the Western — and increasingly global — lifestyle, a major determinant of
susceptibility to type 2 diabetes must therefore be an individual’s genetic make-up, which
dictates the response to nutritional overload or therapeutic intervention.
Metformin works mainly by reducing glucose production by the liver, but there is still
uncertainty about its mechanism of action at a molecular level. The drug blocks a step in the
aerobic production of the cellular energy molecule ATP, activating a signalling pathway in
which the enzyme AMPK senses energetic stress within the cell. Nonetheless, despite
activating AMPK, metformin actually works independently of the enzyme2.3. The discovery
of a role for ATM in modulating metformin responsiveness might provide a clue to the
mechanism of action of this drug.
Unfortunately, however, it could equally well be a false lead. Classic genetic screens have
taught us that some candidate genes can exert very indirect effects, providing little
information about crucial signalling pathways. For example, variations in another gene also

Birnbaum and Shaw

affect metformin responsiveness, but that gene’s product, OCT1, influences the rate of
uptake of metformin by cells, rather than any major signalling pathway4.

Another possibility is that ATM influences blood glucose levels through pathways parallel
to — but not the same as — those modulated by metformin, and that its effects become
apparent only with synergistic input from the drug. Indeed, 40 years ago, it was noted 5 that
patients with ataxia telangiectasia often display a type-2-diabetes-like syndrome
characterized by an insulin resistance too severe to be caused just by changes in liver
glucose production.
With the genetic clues now to hand, careful biochemical and cell-biological studies should
be performed to figure out the nature of the interaction between ATM and the beneficial
effects of metformin. Most crucial will be to find out whether there are other molecules,
apart from AMPK, that both control metabolism and are influenced by ATM.

The cancer connection, Reuben J. Shaw

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A tumour-suppressor protein that mediates DNA repair and has ties with a metabolic
disorder1 — this might sound far-fetched. But in fact the reported link between
responsiveness to metformin and a cancer gene is not without precedent.
Previous work has shown that activation of AMPK by metformin requires the activity of the
kinase enzyme LKB1. The gene encoding LKB1 was originally identified for causing an
inherited cancer disorder, and is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human lung
cancer6. Animal studies also point to a role for this gene in a variety of spontaneously
arising cancers. Notably, deletion of Lkb1 in mouse liver leads to loss of AMPK activity in
that organ and to the development of metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycaemia and
hepatic steatosis — symptoms resembling those of type 2 diabetes7. Furthermore, a genetic
survey revealed that DNA-base variations in LKB1 affect how women with polycystic ovary
syndrome respond to treatment with metformin8.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The fact that the present study (the first GWAS to find a locus that 'dictates' metformin
response) has identified a possible role for ATM — which is also a kinase enzyme — could
fit in with several earlier observations. For instance, patients with ataxia telangiectasia show
insulin resistance and are at a higher risk of developing diabetes, and mice with defective
ATM activity show insulin resistance and abnormal glucose homeostasis9.
How might ATM be involved at a molecular level? The present work1 hypothesizes that this
enzyme modulates patients' responsiveness to metformin by affecting the drug's ability to
activate AMPK. Indeed, ATM is known to phosphorylate LKB1 — AMPK's key
activator10, 11 — thereby affecting various cellular processes. ATM might also regulate
AMPK independently of LKB1. Furthermore, it may affect metformin responsiveness by
regulating other relevant targets that are independent of AMPK (Fig. 1). Indeed, ATM is
known to phosphorylate other components of the insulin signalling pathway12, 13.
In light of these intriguing connections, it is essential to rigorously examine whether the
rs11212617 variant serves to modulate ATM activity, towards AMPK activation or that of

other downstream targets. From the present data, it is not clear whether ATM activity is
even perturbed by this variant.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As for metformin's relevance to cancer therapy, patients with diabetes who take this drug
have a lower risk of developing cancer than those on other anti-diabetes medications14.
Whether metformin is a general activator of ATM and its targets in the DNA-damageresponse pathway should therefore be thoroughly investigated. Although LKB1 and AMPK
are good candidates for mediating some of the beneficial effects of metformin on cancer
risk, the involvement of the broader tumour-suppressor pathways controlled by ATM is an
intriguing possibility. Future studies dissecting the relationship between metformin action,
ATM, LKB1 and AMPK should shed light on the intersection between suppression of the
risk of cancer and that of diabetes.

Figure 1. Possible mechanisms of the anti-diabetic effects of ATM

In response to metformin, ATM could mediate the phosphorylation (P), and so the
activation, of AMPK by phosphorylating LKB1. Alternatively, ATM might activate AMPK
independently of LKB1, or reduce blood glucose levels through pathways entirely
independent of AMPK.
