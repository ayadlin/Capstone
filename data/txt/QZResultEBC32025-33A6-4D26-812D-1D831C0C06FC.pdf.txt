BACKGROUND: Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is common in head and neck cancers, and it has been demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR complex 1 sensitizes cell lines to platinum and
taxane chemotherapy. The authors conducted a phase 1 study to evaluate the addition of oral everolimus to cisplatin and docetaxel
as induction chemotherapy for head and neck cancer. METHODS: In this single-institution phase 1 study, 3 doses of daily everolimus
were explored: 5 mg daily, 7.5 mg daily (administered as 5 mg daily alternating with 10 mg daily), and 10 mg daily of each 21-day
cycle. Cisplatin and docetaxel doses were fixed (both were 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of 21-day cycle) at each dose level with pegfilgrastim
support. A standard 3 þ 3 dose-escalation plan was used. After induction, patients were removed from protocol. RESULTS: Eighteen
patients were enrolled (15 men, 3 women), and their median Karnofsky performance status was 90. The most common toxicities were
hyperglycemia, low hemoglobin, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were neutropenic fever (1 event at
dose level 2, 2 events at dose level 3), and all patients recovered fully from these DLTs. The maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at
dose level 3. The progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 87.5% (95% confidence interval, 56.8%-96.7%); and, at 2 years, it was
76.6% (95% confidence interval, 41.2%-92.3%). Activating PI3K catalytic subunit a (PIK3CA) gene mutations were identified in 2
human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The phase 2 recommended dose was 7.5 mg daily for everolimus plus cisplatin and docetaxel (both at 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle) given with pegfilgrastim support. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
For patients with locally and/or regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), primary treatment
with induction docetaxel (Taxotere), cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) chemotherapy followed by definitive radiationbased therapy has emerged in recent years as an effective treatment strategy.1,2 Induction chemotherapy offers theoretical
advantages, including early treatment of micrometastatic disease and the potential for improved long-term speech and
swallowing function, compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.3,4 However, TPF can be associated with significant toxicities. The combination of 3 cytotoxic agents is associated with substantial myelotoxicity. In the TAX324 study, 83% of
patients experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and 12% of patients experienced febrile neutropenia during induction
TPF.1 5-Fluorouracil can be logistically cumbersome to administer, because it requires a continuous infusion, and it can
be associated with significant mucositis in some patients. In view of these concerns regarding the toxicity and logistical
challenges associated with TPF, an appropriate question for clinical research is whether 5-fluorouracil can be replaced
with a molecularly targeted agent that may be better tolerated and would be less cumbersome to administer.
Everolimus (Afinitor, RAD001) is an orally available rapamycin analog that allosterically inhibits the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase. mTOR is central regulator of cell growth and survival
in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and is present in 2 intracellular complexes, mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1) and mTORC2.5,6 Downstream targets of mTORC1 are the protein translation regulator 4E-BP1 and ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). mTORC2 regulates the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473. Everolimus and other
rapamycin analogues potently inhibit mTORC1 and also may inhibit mTORC2 in some contexts.7

Original Article

Clinical study of inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway in HNSCC is supported by the findings of the
Head and Neck Cancer Tissue Array Initiative, which
observed alterations of this pathway in most of the >400
pathology tumor cores that were analyzed.8 In another
study that evaluated somatic point mutations and copy
number alterations in 26 oral cavity squamous cell cancers, activating alterations in the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)/PI3K pathway were observed in 74% of
tumors.9 Additional justification for the study of mTOR
inhibitors in the head and neck cancer stems from an
extensive preclinical literature, which demonstrates additive or synergistic effects when mTOR inhibitors are combined with platinum and/or taxane agents.10-14
In a phase 1 study of daily everolimus plus low-dose
weekly cisplatin for patients with advanced solid tumors,
we observed that the regimen was well tolerated.15 One
patient with sinus carcinoma experienced a partial
response, and 1 patient with advanced oropharyngeal cancer experienced prolonged stabilization of disease. Similarly, everolimus was well tolerated when combined with
docetaxel in phase 1, and the phase 2 recommended dose
from that study was everolimus 10 mg/daily plus docetaxel 70 mg/m2.16
The current phase 1 study evaluates the addition of
everolimus to induction chemotherapy in patients with
stage III/IVB HNSCC. At the time this study was
designed in 2008, we did not wish to combine everolimus
plus 5-fluorouracil because of safety concerns. A phase 1
study of an mTOR inhibitor (CCI-779) plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was closed because of dose-limiting mucositis.17 We postulated that everolimus may provide an
effective and safe alternative to 5-fluorouracil during
induction chemotherapy in head and neck cancer. Everolimus appears to have a more favorable side-effect profile
than infusional 5-fluorouracil and would be less cumbersome to administer.
Therefore, we designed a phase 1 study to define the
phase 2 recommended dose of everolimus when added to
high-dose cisplatin plus docetaxel as induction chemotherapy for patients with HNSCC, with pegfilgrastim support.
We selected the cisplatin dose of 75 mg/m2 that was used
in TAX323 rather than the cisplatin dose of 100 mg/m2
that was used in TAX324.1,2 The cisplatin dose selected
(75 mg/m2) reflects concerns about the potential of mTOR
inhibitors to intensify the myelosuppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this context, we believed that the
lower dose of cisplatin was appropriate from a safety standpoint. The selection of the lower dose of cisplatin also was
influenced by preclinical data indicating that mTOR inhib1824

itors may sensitize cancer cells to lower doses of platinumbased chemotherapy, thereby creating an opportunity to
develop clinical regimens with submaximal dosing of cisplatin that may be better tolerated than regimens incorporating maximal dose levels of cisplatin.10-14
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility Criteria

This was a single-institution, phase 1 study that was
approved by our hospital’s institutional review board. All
patients provided written informed consent. Eligible
patients had previously untreated stage III through IVB
HNSCC or nasopharyngeal cancer (World Health Organization type I, II, or III), were aged 18 years, and had a
Karnofsky performance status 70%. Baseline laboratory
requirements were an absolute neutrophil count 1.5 
109/L, platelets 100  109/L, hemoglobin >10 g/dL,
serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, serum bilirubin 1.0 mg/
dL, activated partial thromboplastin time <1.5 times the
upper limits of normal (ULN), and an International Normalized Ratio <1.5. Aspartate or alanine aminotransferase elevations up to 1.5 times the ULN were allowed if the
alkaline phosphatase level was 2.5 times the ULN.
Patients were excluded for hearing loss requiring
hearing aid or intervention; multifocal peripheral sensory
alterations or paresthesias interfering with activities of
daily living; oxygen saturation 88% at rest on room air
by pulse oximetry; liver disease, such as cirrhosis or severe
hepatic impairment (Childs-Pugh class C); immunization
with live vaccine within 1 week of study entry; hyperglycemia grade 2 (Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0); therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin; requirement for chronic
treatment with steroids (prednisone 5 mg daily); impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that could significantly alter the absorption of
everolimus; known infection with human immunodeficiency virus; or other active infection or serious underlying medical condition that would impair the patient’s
ability to receive protocol treatment.
Treatment Plan

Patients received an induction chemotherapy regimen
consisting of daily everolimus (per the dose-escalation
scheme) plus concurrent docetaxel and cisplatin (both 75
mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, every 21 days). The dose
escalation was for everolimus only, and the doses of cisplatin and docetaxel were fixed. The study regimen is provided in Table 1. Pegfilgrastim (6 mg subcutaneously)
was administered on day 2 of each cycle. Three cycles of

induction chemotherapy were planned for each patient.
After induction chemotherapy, patients were removed
from the study, and definitive management of the primary
tumor/involved neck lymph nodes was at the discretion of
the treating team, according to standard practice.
Dose Escalation and Definition of Dose-Limiting
Toxicity

A standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation plan was followed.
Patient 1 was enrolled at dose level 1. If 1 of the initial 3
patients in a dose level experienced dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT), then 3 additional patients would be enrolled at
that dose level. If 0 of 3 patients or if 1 of 6 patients experienced DLT at a given dose level, then 3 additional patients
could be enrolled at the next higher dose level. Completion
of 1 cycle without DLT by all patients at any dose level
was required before any patients could be enrolled at the
next dose level. If 2 or more patients in any cohort of up
to 6 patients experienced DLT during cycle 1, then the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded. The
MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which 1 of
6 patients experienced DLT during cycle 1.
DLT definitions were modified from prior studies
of induction chemotherapy in head and neck cancer.18,19
DLT was defined as grade 4 neutropenia for more than 7
days, febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1.0
 109/L, fever 38.5 C), grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or
any grade 3 toxicities other than those specified as nonDLT in the protocol. The protocol specified that only
those events that were judged as possibly, probably, or
definitely related to everolimus were deemed DLTs.
Adverse events that we believed were related to cisplatin,
docetaxel, or head and neck cancer, at the investigator’s
discretion, were not necessarily considered DLTs.
Safety Evaluations

Before each cycle of therapy, patients underwent clinical
evaluation and comprehensive laboratory tests (complete
Cancer

blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, liver function
tests, and lipid panel). Patients were evaluated weekly in
the clinic during cycle 1, including routine laboratory
studies (complete blood cell count, basic metabolic
panel). During cycles 2 and 3, patients were evaluated in
the clinic on day 1 and underwent at least 1 additional
clinic evaluation per cycle with routine laboratory studies.
Patients were followed for toxicity for 30 days after the
last dose of everolimus. Adverse events were graded
according to National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE, version
3.0. Patients who experienced DLT during cycle 1 were
removed from the study, and subsequent management off
protocol was according to standards of care for head and
neck cancer. Patients who maintained active follow-up
underwent a safety assessment approximately 30 days after
the off-study date.
Efficacy Assessments

Pretreatment assessment included cross-sectional imaging
of the neck (computed tomography of the neck with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium)
within 6 weeks before therapy. Restaging imaging studies
occurred within 2 to 6 weeks after the final treatment with
cisplatin/docetaxel (typically during cycle 3 for patients
who were not removed from the study earlier). Radiologic
response criteria were based on previously published
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
guidelines.20 However, confirmation of response was not
obtained, because such confirmatory radiologic assessments would be confounded by the impact of subsequent
definitive locoregional therapy off protocol. Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated according the method of Kaplan and Meier.
Human Papillomavirus Assay

For most patients with primary tumors of the base of
tongue or tonsil, the presence or absence of high-risk
human papillomavirus (HPV) strains was determined

using the Ventana HPV III family 16 probe (Ventana
Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, Ariz).21 For patients with
other primary sites, HPV testing is not routinely obtained
in our clinical practice.
Mass Spectrometry Genotyping

Mass spectrometry genotyping using the iPLEX system
(Sequenom, San Diego, Calif) was performed according
to established methods.22,23 Genomic DNA was extracted
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of 100-base pair to
150-base pair fragments with primers bracketing the
mutation of interest was conducted. Extension primers
designed immediately adjacent to the mutation site
allowed extension by 1 nucleotide, depending on the template sequence, and allelic-specific differences in mass
between extended products were measured by time of
flight after laser deionization. Wild-type and mutant alleles were distinguished with the use of Sequenom software. We used the multiplexed system developed by
Dr. Solit and colleagues for genotyping PIK3CA, AKT1,
KRAS, NRAS and BRAF.24
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between August 25, 2009 and April 22, 2011, 18 patients
were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of the entire enrolled
study population are summarized in Table 2. Among 18
enrolled patients, most were men (n ¼ 15), and median the
age was 56 years (range, 44-70 years). The median Karnofsky performance status was 90 (range, 80-100). The most
common primary tumor site was the oropharynx (n ¼ 14).
Most patients had stage IVA disease (n ¼ 14).
Among 14 patients with oropharyngeal primary
tumors, 7 were positive for the p16 immunohistochemistry
assay. The p16 assay was not done in the other oropharyngeal tumors. Six of the patients who had oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma were never-smokers.
Dose Escalation and Description
of Dose-Limiting Toxicities

There were no DLTs among 3 patients who were treated
at dose level 1, and enrollment for dose level 2 was initiated. Eight patients were enrolled at dose level 2. Two
patients who were enrolled at dose level 2 were deemed
inevaluable for toxicity assessment and were replaced. The
safety evaluation was based on 6 evaluable patients at dose
level 2, and there was 1 DLT. He was a man aged 56 years
with stage IVA oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
who developed neutropenic fever during cycle 1. He
recovered fully from this event and completed treatment

for his cancer off protocol. Also at dose level 2, 1 patient
was removed from the study during cycle 2 because of a
grade 2 microperforation of the small bowel, which was
not deemed to be a DLT.
Regarding the 2 patients at dose level 2 who were
deemed inevaluable for safety, 1 was a woman aged 70
years with stage IVB oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who had baseline grade 1 hyponatremia. She was
admitted to hospital on day 5 of cycle 1 with grade 3 hyponatremia. The patient and her family indicated that she
had only taken 2 doses of everolimus instead of daily dosing as prescribed, but a pill diary was not provided. It was
believed that her toxicities were related to cisplatin and
that everolimus probably was not related. She was
removed from study because of excessive cisplatin-related
toxicities and lack of adherence to the everolimus regimen. She was discharged in stable condition after a 10day hospitalization, during which hyponatremia worsened to grade 4 and then resolved to baseline. The other
patient who was deemed inevaluable at dose level 2 was a
man aged 50 years with stage IVA oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. He tolerated treatment well; however, during cycle 3, the investigator learned that the
patient had been taking everolimus irregularly. The
patient presented pill diaries indicating appropriate study
drug administration; but, after extensive discussion, his
pill diaries were deemed unreliable. Thus, the patient was
Cancer

deemed inevaluable for the safety endpoint. After 5 of 6
evaluable patients completed cycle 1 at dose level 2 without DLT, the decision was made to begin enrollment at
dose level 3.
Seven patients were enrolled at dose level 3, but 1
was never treated on the study. Among 6 evaluable
patients at dose level 3, there were 2 DLTs. One patient
was a man aged 60 years with stage IVA oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma, and the other was a man aged
59 years with stage IVA oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Both events were febrile neutropenia, and the patients
recovered fully. Another patient at dose level 3, a man
aged 55 years with stage IVA oropharyngeal squamous
cell carcinoma, was removed from study after cycle 1
because of poor tolerance in the context of an episode of
acute prostatitis and transient creatinine elevation that the
investigator did not believe constituted DLT.
We deemed that the MTD was exceeded at dose
level 3 because of the 2 episodes of febrile neutropenia.
Dose level 2 was designated the MTD, because there was
only 1 DLT among 6 evaluable patients at dose level 2.
Adverse Events Associated with Induction
Chemotherapy

Fifteen patients were evaluable for toxicity among 18 enrolled patients. Not included in the safety analysis are 2
patients who were removed from study because of noncompliance with oral everolimus and 1 patient who was
never treated on study. Table 3 lists all adverse events,
regardless of attribution, that occurred in >30% of the
study population regardless of grade or were 3 grade in
at least 2 patients. The most common adverse events of
any grade were hyperglycemia, low hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue. The relation between everolimus and hyperglycemia was difficult to evaluate because
of the contributory effect of steroids given as the standard
of care with docetaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy. The
most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were leukopenia and lymphopenia. There were no treatment-related
deaths. There were no instances of grade 3 mucositis on
clinical examination, but 3 patients (20%) experienced
grade 2 mucositis on clinical examination. One patient
with grade 2 mucositis on clinical examination had grade
3 functional mucositis according to CTCAE version 3.0.
Subsequent Definitive Therapy

Patients were removed from study after induction chemotherapy on this protocol. Subsequent management was at
the discretion of the treating physician and was not specified by the protocol. The reported adverse events are only
those associated with induction chemotherapy, and not

those associated with subsequent definitive therapy. Among
18 enrolled patients, 16 received subsequent definitive radiation therapy at this center. The concurrent chemotherapy
regimens for these patients were weekly cisplatin (n ¼ 5),
cetuximab plus experimental agent on another clinical trial
(n ¼ 4), weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel (n ¼ 2), weekly
cisplatin plus experimental agent on another clinical trial (n
¼ 2), weekly cisplatin plus paclitaxel, weekly cetuximab,
and bolus cisplatin every 3 weeks (n ¼ 1 each). One patient
was enrolled but not treated on the study and received therapy with his local oncologist. The woman aged 70 years
with oropharyngeal cancer at dose level 2 who was removed
from study during cycle 1 because of excessive cisplatinrelated toxicities and noncompliance with everolimus
declined subsequent anticancer therapy.

among the tumor samples from patients in the study with
this assay panel.
Efficacy

Patients who received at least 2 cycles of study treatment
were deemed evaluable for radiologic response evaluation.
Table 4 describes the radiologic response data for the 10
patients who were evaluable for response and gives the reasons for inevaluable status for the patients who were
treated but were not evaluable for response. Among evaluable patients, all experienced decreases in measurable disease, and 6 met criteria for an unconfirmed response.
Survival analysis for the study population is descriptive only. The survival data cutoff date was June 30, 2012.
Among 17 patients who received any treatment on study
(median follow-up, 17.8 months), the 1-year overall survival rate was 100%, and the 2-year overall survival rate
was 91% (95% confidence interval, 50.8%-98.7%). Progression-free survival at was 87.5% at 1 year (95% confi1828

dence interval, 56.8%-96.7%) and 76.6% at 2 years (95%
confidence interval, 41.2%-92.3%).
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated the safety and tolerability
of a novel induction chemotherapy regimen in which
everolimus was added to standard doses of cisplatin and
docetaxel (both 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle,
with pegfilgrastim support) for patients with locally and/
or regionally advanced head and neck cancer. The phase 2
recommended dose of everolimus is 7.5 mg daily, administered as 5 mg daily and 10 mg daily on alternating days.
The DLT in this study was neutropenic fever.
Previous phase 1 studies that led to development of
the TPF regimen are instructive with regard to interpreting data from the current study.18,19 In the prior studies, a
dose level would be deemed unacceptable if 3 of 6 patients
developed the same DLT.18,19 The current study defined
MTD as the maximum dose level at which 1 of 6
patients experienced any DLT that the investigators
believed was related to everolimus. If the DLT definition
Cancer

in the current protocol had been more similar to the DLT
definitions used in the phase 1 studies for TPF, then it is
possible that the 10-mg daily dose of everolimus could
have been deemed acceptable. However, in accordance
with the dose-escalation rules in the protocol, the recommended dose of everolimus in this study was 7.5 mg daily.
At dose levels 2 and 3, there was a wide range of tolerability of this regimen among the enrolled patients. For
some patients, a dose reduction in everolimus to 5 mg
daily may be necessary if significant adverse events occur.
We note that pharmacokinetic data from the phase 1
study of everolimus monotherapy indicated that most
patients achieve therapeutic levels of everolimus at a dose
5 mg daily.25 Thus, the combination of everolimus 5
mg daily plus docetaxel and cisplatin would likely constitute exposure to therapeutic everolimus levels for most
patients who required this dose reduction.
For patients with head and neck cancer who are
receiving induction chemotherapy, prophylaxis to reduce
the risk of neutropenic fever is the standard of care. The
TAX323 and TAX324 studies featured prophylactic
ciprofloxacin on days 5 through 15 of each cycle.1,2 The
current protocol did not include prophylactic ciprofloxacin because of theoretical concerns about the potential
emergence of resistant organisms with prophylactic antibiotic use and concerns about potential drug-drug interactions because of the cytochrome P450, family 3,
subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)-inhibitory effects
of ciprofloxacin.26,27 Further study would be necessary to
determine whether there is any clinical benefit or harm
associated with pegfilgrastim prophylaxis versus antibiotic
prophylaxis for patients with head and neck cancer who
are receiving the induction chemotherapy regimen of
everolimus plus cisplatin plus docetaxel.
When patients received TPF with prophylactic
ciprofloxacin in large randomized phase 3 trials, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 5% in the TAX323 study
and 12% in the TAX324 study.1,2 The incidence of febrile
neutropenia in the current phase 2 study was 20% (3
events among 15 evaluable patients). However, 2 of the
episodes of febrile neutropenia in our study occurred at
dose level 3, which was deemed to exceed the MTD. To
estimate the incidence of febrile neutropenia with everolimus plus cisplatin and docetaxel, a larger phase 2 study of
the dose level 2 regimen would be informative.
The DLTs observed in this study were related to
neutropenia, consistent with prior observations regarding
the additive myelosuppressive effects of mTOR inhibitors
when combined with platinum-based and/or taxanebased chemotherapy. A shared feature of those studies is
Cancer

the clinically apparent intensification of myelosuppression with the addition of an mTOR inhibitor.28-33 In a
phase 1 study of patients with recurrent or metastatic
squamous cell cancer, we observed that full-dose temsirolimus (25 mg per week intravenously) could be safely
administered with low-dose weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, but not with a
more intensive schedule of carboplatin and paclitaxel
because of myelosuppression.33
In a phase 1 study of weekly everolimus plus docetaxel every 3 weeks for patients with metastatic breast cancer, the trial was terminated in the context of excessive
neutropenia.31 In a phase 1 study of patients with recurrent/refractory nonsmall cell lung cancer, the recommended dose was everolimus 5 mg daily (on days 1-19)
plus docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 3 weeks.32 The ability to
deliver everolimus 7.5 mg daily with full-dose docetaxel
and cisplatin (both 75 mg/m2, every 21 days) in the current study differs from those experiences and may be
related to several factors. All patients in the current study
were previously untreated, whereas 80% of patients in the
breast cancer study had received >2 prior chemotherapy
regimens for metastatic disease,31 and most patients in the
lung cancer study had received at least 1 prior regimen.32
All patients in our head and neck cancer study received
pegfilgrastim support, which was not a component of the
breast cancer or lung cancer protocols. Potentially, the
intensification of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression may be less severe with everolimus administered at
low doses on a daily basis compared with the weekly
administration of everolimus at higher dose in the breast
cancer study.
Tissue correlative assays in this study identified 2
squamous cell carcinomas of the base of tongue with activating mutations in the helical domain of PIK3CA, and
both of those tumors were associated with HPV. Larger
studies are needed to determine whether activating
PIK3CA mutations may occur in a clinically significant
proportion of HPV-associated tumors and whether such
lesions may be associated with the efficacy of everolimus.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a characteristic of both HPV-positive and HPV-negative
HNSCC,34,35 and there appear to be multiple mechanisms that activate this pathway in head and neck cancers.
Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) may be
more common in HPV-negative tumors than in HPVpositive tumors.36 Preclinically, it has been observed that
the HPV 16 E6 oncoprotein activates mTORC1 signaling
and cap-dependent translation.37,38 Further delineation
of the mechanisms of mTOR activation in HPV-positive

and HPV-negative tumors would guide the interpretation
of data regarding candidate biomarkers in future phase 2
studies involving everolimus.
This phase 1 study defines an induction chemotherapy regimen in which patients receive everolimus (7.5 mg
daily) plus docetaxel and cisplatin (both 75 mg/m2 on day
1 of a 21-day cycle) with pegfilgrastim support. Efficacy
assessments are descriptive only in this small phase I study
in which patients subsequently received definitive therapy
for local/regional disease off protocol. A larger phase 2
study of this induction chemotherapy regimen followed
by definitive locoregional therapy to assess efficacy and
explore candidate biomarkers is warranted. We have
recently reported the results from a phase 1 study of everolimus plus low-dose weekly cisplatin and definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for patients
with head and neck cancer,39 and that chemoradiation
regimen could be used after induction chemotherapy with
everolimus plus docetaxel and cisplatin in an efficacybased phase 2 study.
