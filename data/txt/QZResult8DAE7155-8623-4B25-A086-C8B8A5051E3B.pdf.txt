Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cellular senescence has historically been viewed as an irreversible cell-cycle arrest mechanism
that acts to protect against cancer, but recent discoveries have extended its known role to complex
biological processes such as development, tissue repair, ageing and age-related disorders. New
insights indicate that, unlike a static endpoint, senescence represents a series of progressive and
phenotypically diverse cellular states acquired after the initial growth arrest. A deeper
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multi-step progression of senescence
and the development and function of acute versus chronic senescent cells may lead to new
therapeutic strategies for age-related pathologies and extend healthy lifespan.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cellular senescence is a process in which cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive
phenotypic alterations, including profound chromatin and secretome changes, and tumoursuppressor activation1–6. Hayflick and Moorhead first introduced the term senescence to
describe the phenomenon of irreversible growth arrest of human diploid cell strains after
extensive serial passaging in culture7. Later, this particular type of senescence (replicative
senescence) was causally linked to telomere attrition, a process that leads to chromosomal
instability and promotes tumorigenesis, supporting the original hypothesis that senescence
guards against unrestricted growth of damaged cells7,8. Subsequent studies have reinforced
the importance of cellular senescence as a safeguard against cancer9. Emerging evidence
indicates that the physiological relevance of cellular senescence extends beyond tumour
suppression into biological processes such as embryonic development10–12, wound
healing13, tissue repair14 and organismal ageing15,16. In fact, Hayflick and Moorhead
initially postulated a role for replicative senescence in ageing, but until recently this theory
remained untested7. The multifunctional nature of cellular senescence raises the question as
to whether fundamentally different senescence mechanisms underlie these diverse biological
roles. This Review focuses on this and other key emerging concepts in the senescence field,
including ‘assisted’ cell cycling, multi-step senescence (or senescence progression), acute
versus chronic senescence and senescence of post-mitotic cells. How these concepts relate to
the role of senescent cells in ageing and age-related diseases and how the rapidly accruing
new information could be exploited to clear detrimental senescent cell populations
selectively to improve healthy lifespan are also discussed.

Causes and effector pathways of senescence
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Research on the causes (or stresses), signalling networks and mechanisms underlying the
various types of cellular senescence is still in its infancy and current insights are largely
based on cell culture experiments. In addition to telomere erosion, several other tumourassociated stresses have been shown to induce a senescent growth arrest in vitro, including
certain DNA lesions and reactive oxygen species (ROS)17–19. What both these stresses have
in common with telomere damage is that they activate the DNA damage response (DDR), a
signalling pathway in which ATM or ATR kinases block cell-cycle progression through
stabilization of p53 and transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)
inhibitor p21. Activated oncogenes are also prominent inducers of senescence. Oncogenic
Ras acts through overexpression of Cdc6 and suppression of nucleotide metabolism, causing
aberrant DNA replication, formation of double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) and activation
of the DDR pathway20,21. However, senescence caused by E2F3 activation or c-Myc
inhibition is DDR-independent and involves p19Arf and p16Ink4a (refs 17, 22).
BRAF(V600E) is also DDR-independent and induces senescence through a metabolic
mechanism involving upregulation of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; Fig.
1)23. Several other studies underscored that senescence is closely linked to profound
metabolic changes24,25. Furthermore, various tumour suppressors trigger a senescent growth
arrest when inactivated, including RB, PTEN, NF1 and VHL17,26. Of these, RB inactivation
engages the DDR26, whereas the others are DDR-independent and act through p19Arf and
p16Ink4a. A notable species-specific difference is that senescence pathways of murine cells
are more dependent on p19Arf than senescence in human cells27.

Prolonged exposure to interferon-β also induces senescence, demonstrating that chronic
mitogenic signalling outside the context of neoplastic transformation can stimulate
senescence28. Other, less broadly studied inducers of senescence include epigenetic,
nucleolar and mitotic spindle stresses (Fig. 1). For example, genome-wide chromatin
decompression by exposure to histone deacetylase inhibitors triggers senescence via a p21dependent mechanism29. A key target of epigenetic stressors that promote senescence may
be the INK4a/ARF locus, which in proliferating cells is repressed by polycomb groupmediated H3K27 methylation and H2A-K119 ubiquitination30. Nucleolar stress caused by
RNA polymerase I inhibitors triggers a robust p53-mediated senescence response31.
Senescence can also be elicited by suboptimal expression of proteins implicated in spindle
formation or mitotic checkpoint control, including human TACC3 and murine BubR1, Bub3
and Rae1, all of which engage p53 and p21 independently of the DDR, often in combination
with p16Ink4a (refs 15, 32, 33). It is highly likely that additional stressors and mechanisms
that drive cells into senescence will be uncovered given the rapidly evolving nature of the
field. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines is emerging as a common
feature of senescent cells irrespective of the senescence-inducing stressor or mechanism
(Fig. 1).
Although the relative contributions of the p53–p21 and p16Ink4a–RB effector pathways to
the initial growth arrest can vary depending on the type of stress, both may ultimately
become engaged upon sustained senescence. For example, DNA damage initially halts cellcycle progression through p53-mediated induction of p21, but if lesions persist, this

activates p16Ink4a through p38-MAPK-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS
production34,35. The extent to which effector mechanisms of in vitro senescence apply to in
vivo senescence has not been tested extensively. Fat, skeletal muscle and eye of BubR1
progeroid mice have elevated levels of p19Arf, p53, p21 and p16Ink4 and are subject to
precocious functional decline15,36. Genetic experiments using knockout strains for each of
these tumour suppressors that dissected how senescent cells accumulate in these tissues and
contribute to their deterioration, established that p16Ink4a is an effector of senescence and
ageing15. However, in contrast to in vitro findings, p19Arf, p53 and p21 prevented
senescence and age-related pathologies in vivo15,36. These unexpected findings led to the
concept of ‘assisted’ cell cycling (analogous to assisted living) in which ageing cells, coping
with an increasing burden of macromolecular damage and other chronic stresses, manage to
retain their proliferative potential for a while by extending cell-cycle duration in a p21dependent manner to provide extra time to mend cellular disabilities through engagement of
compensatory mechanisms or repair (Fig. 1). Although this concept is supported by the
observation that the cell-cycle time of cultured primary human cells markedly increases with
passaging37, it clearly requires more validation and generalization. Inactivation of p21
improves stem cell function in intestinal crypts and bone marrow in mutant mice with short
telomeres38, indicating that in situations where irreparable damage produces a sustained and
robust p53 response, p21 acts to promote tissue deterioration by executing senescence.

In vitro studies of cellular senescence have traditionally been performed using a single
senescence-inducing stimulus (that is, high-dose radiation or oncogenes; Fig. 1). However,
in the context of organismal ageing, individual cells experience multiple cellular pressures,
including various kinds of genotoxic, proteotoxic and mitotic stresses3,39. Thus, to advance
our understanding of these processes, it will be imperative to examine how combinations of
diverse senescence-promoting stressors impact the actions of the various downstream
effector pathways and the characteristics of the resulting senescent phenotypes.
Furthermore, while cellular senescence is well recognized as an in vivo tumour suppressive
mechanism, its irreversibility remains a topic of debate. However, compelling new evidence
indicates that BRAF(V600E) oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) can be reversed by
activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or inhibition of PDH (Fig. 1)23,40. In
addition, senescent cells have been successfully dedifferentiated into pluripotent stem
cells41.

Senescence is a multi-step evolving process
Until recently, senescence was viewed as a static endpoint. However, several recent
observations support the hypothesis that senescence can be a highly dynamic, multi-step
process, during which the properties of senescent cells continuously evolve and diversify,
much like tumorigenesis but without cell proliferation as a driver (Fig. 2)42–44. The initiating
step is the transition of temporal to stable cell-cycle arrest, which typically involves
prolonged inhibition of Cdk–cyclin activity by p21, p16Ink4a, or both. A change in p53
expression from intermittent to continuous may be a critical event in the transition from
temporal to persistent growth arrest45.

For the progression to full senescence, it seems that lamin B1 downregulation triggers both
global and local modifications in chromatin methylation46–48 (Fig. 2). Some mammalian cell
types form regions of highly condensed chromatin called senescence-associated
heterochromatin foci (SAHFs)49–51. SAHFs, which are enriched in chromatin modifications
such as S83-HP1γ, HIRA, ASF1, macroH2A, H3K9me3 and γH2AX, sequester genes
implicated in cell-cycle control, a phenomenon that seems to reinforce the senescenceassociated growth arrest. Decondensation of (peri)centromeric satellite heterochromatin has
been identified as a universal hallmark of senescence that precedes SAHF formation52.
Senescence-related chromatin remodelling leads to profound transcriptional changes48,53,54.
Among the assortment of upregulated genes is a prominent subset of genes that encode
secreted proteins, including cytokines and chemokines with proinflammatory properties, as
well as various growth factors and proteases that together alter tissue structure and function.
Collectively, these factors are referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP)55,56 or senescence-messaging secretome (SMS)57. The SASP is one of the key
characteristics that distinguish senescent cells from quiescent, terminally differentiated, and
other types of non-proliferating cells (Fig. 2). In certain cases, the SASP is dependent on
persistent DNA damage signalling56, such as that created through a positive feedback loop
between DDR signalling and ROS35. This loop was uncovered using human fibroblast lines
in which dominant-negative TRF2 or high dose ionizing radiation induced telomeredependent and telomere-independent DDR signalling, respectively. Both types of DDR
signalling were found to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and production of ROS which led
to new DNA damage and continued DDR signalling. Consistent with this, primary human
fibroblasts overexpressing p16Ink4a or p21 undergo senescent growth arrest but fail to
activate the DDR and do not produce a SASP58. Importantly, several senescence-inducing
stimuli produce SASPs independent of DNA damage (Fig. 1), implying the existence of
DDR-independent mechanisms11,12,23.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the intricate nature of the SASP, it is not surprising that senescent cells impact
various biological processes that involve paracrine signalling, including cell proliferation,
angiogenesis59, inflammation60, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)61, wound
healing13, and other types of tissue repair14. Several SASP components, including IL-6,
IL-8, WNT16B and GROα, also act in an autocrine fashion in the context of OIS,
presumably to help establish a persistent growth arrest62–64. Importantly, SASP factors vary
indistinct cell types and under different senescence-inducing stressors55. This plasticity
within SASP composition predicts variability with respect to the biological processes
impacted by different kinds of senescent cells (Fig. 2). Proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines are among the SASP components that are highly conserved across cell types
and senescence-inducing stimuli55, suggesting that attracting immune cells and inducing
local inflammation are common properties of senescent cells. However, accumulation of
senescent cells is not always accompanied by immune cell infiltration and inflammation, as
exemplified by melanocytic nevi65.
Cultured cells usually reach senescence within several weeks after exposure to senescenceinducing stressors, but remain viable for months thereafter42. Senescent cells continue to
evolve even after extended periods of culture, thereby progressing to a stage that has been
termed ‘deep’ or ‘late’ senescence (Fig. 2). This phenomenon is evidenced by a dramatic

increase in the transcription of transposable elements, including members of the L1, ALU
and SVA transposon families, which occur several months after senescence onset42,43.
These newly synthesized retrotransposon transcripts can indeed engage in active
transposition and accumulate in late-senescent cell genomes. Increased retrotransposon
activity is associated with senescence-associated opening of gene-poor heterochromatic
regions where these elements reside42. A second process driving continued change in
senescent cells is characterized by the extrusion of chromatin into the cytoplasm, resulting in
the formation of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs)44. CCFs are strongly positive for
H3K27me3 and γH2AX, contain DNA, and are processed via lysosome-mediated
proteolysis, resulting in overall histone loss. Both retrotransposon activation and chromatin
budding are examples of continued genomic and epigenomic remodelling in senescent cells.
Both processes seem random in nature and are therefore likely to drive transcriptome
diversity among senescent cells, even in those resulting from a common stressor. Because
transcriptional activity is a key determinant of secretome composition, it is reasonable to
assume that the SASPs of these cells diversify to some degree through these changes. With
the concept of senescence progression in cultured cells solidifying, it becomes essential to
validate its in vivo importance.

Acute versus chronic senescence
The diverse nature of the processes in which senescence has been implicated, ranging from
embryonic development10 to wound healing13, tissue repair14, cancer and ageing16, raises
the question of whether the properties of the senescent cells involved in these activities are
fundamentally different. If so, what would be the underlying molecular mechanisms?
Valuable clues to these questions can be inferred from the apparent differences in
senescence kinetics between these processes. In the context of ageing, cells chronically
accumulate macromolecular damage and may become increasingly dependent on cell-cycle
checkpoints and stress-relief mechanisms to retain proliferative potential (assisted
cycling)15,66–68. Ultimately, more and more of these cells may stably arrest and transition
into a senescent state, referred to here as chronic senescence (Fig. 3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Chronic senescence is different from a process like wound healing, by which upon wound
closure, myofibroblasts suddenly undergo senescence (acute senescence) to limit excessive
fibrosis at the site of injury13 (Fig. 3). Myofibroblast senescence here is induced by the
extracellular matrix protein CCN1, which acts through integrin α6β1 and HSPS-mediated
activation of the RAC1-dependent NADPH oxidase 1 to produce a robust and sustained
accumulation of ROS13. Senescent myofibroblasts limit fibrosis by promoting the
degradation of matrix components through the SASP factors they produce. Importantly,
acute myofibroblast senescence also has a role in repairing damaged organs such as the liver
and thus is likely to represent a more common mechanism to limit fibrosis14,69.
Similar to skin repair and recovery from liver injury, senescent cell induction is also acute
and spatiotemporally controlled in uterine neo-vascularization, a developmental process that
takes place at the site of embryo implantation to supply the embryo with maternal blood10.
HLA-G secreted by embryonic trophoblast cells induces senescence in nearby natural killer
cells, which then start to produce SASP components to promote local angiogenesis and

vascular remodelling. Senescence has also been identified as a prominent mechanism for
remodelling of various tissues during mouse embryogenesis, including the mesonephros, the
endolymphatic sac, the apical ectodermal ridge, and the neural roof plate11,12.
Developmental senescence is p21-dependent, but p53- and DDR-independent, and shares
several features with OIS, including a common gene expression signature and senescenceassociated β-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, OIS itself is triggered by a single defined
stimulus and established with fast kinetics, which would qualify it as acute senescence.
However, cells undergoing OIS are not always cleared by the immune system. For instance
senescent cells in human melanocytic nevi are highly persistent.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thus, senescence induction in tissue repair and development seems to be a scheduled or
programmed process triggered by specific stimuli that target particular types of cells (Fig.
3). In contrast, during ageing-related senescence, the switch from temporal to persistent cellcycle arrest appears unscheduled and stochastic in nature, probably involving the combined
effects of distinct senescence-inducing stressors acting simultaneously on a cell. The
kinetics and efficiency of senescent-cell clearance may constitute another key difference
between acute and chronic senescence. During repair and embryogenesis, disposal of
senescent cells seems very efficient and under strict temporal control11–14. Conversely,
ageing-related senescent cells, may be more persistent due to deterioration of the immune
system with ageing70,71, but further experiments are needed to refine our understanding of
the relationship between senescence and the (ageing) immune system.
Senescence induced by chemotherapeutics or radiation in the context of cancer treatment
may be a combination of acute and chronic senescence (Fig. 3). Acute senescence would
apply to cells that generate a sustained DDR as a rapid response to overwhelming genomic
damage72. In contrast, chronic senescence would pertain to cells experiencing mild
genotoxic stress that can initially be managed through engagement of stress support
pathways. However, as further macromolecular damage occurs over time, these cells may
eventually transition from a pre-senescent state to a persistent cell cycle arrest73. An
interesting untested hypothesis is that cancer therapy-induced senescence contributes to
accelerated tissue and organ deterioration in cancer survivors74.

Senescence of post-mitotic cells
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Most cells in mammals are post-mitotic and the question that has been raised is whether
these cells can obtain key characteristics of senescent cells. Post-mitotic neurons in various
parts of human and mouse brains are known to accumulate high amounts of DNA damage18.
Recent research has revealed that these neurons exhibit several additional senescenceassociated properties, including heterochromatinization, synthesis of proinflammatory
interleukins, and high senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity75. As with mitotic cells
that undergo senescence in response to sustained DNA damage, these phenotypes develop in
a p21-dependent manner, further associating them with senescence (Fig. 4). Senescence-like
features have also been reported for adipocytes of mice on a high-fat diet76, suggesting that
post-mitotic cell senescence may be a broader phenomenon. It will be important to confirm
that these terminally differentiated cells produce a SASP that negatively impacts the

functionality of neighbouring cells (Fig. 4), and to explore whether differentiated cells with
senescent cell properties accumulate in tissues other than brain and fat.

Senescence in ageing and age-related disease
The absence of senescence specific markers has hampered efforts to characterize senescent
cells that accumulate in vivo in tissues and organs. The most reliable in situ detection
methods that are currently available screen for multiple semi-selective senescent cell
characteristics. These include, but are not limited to, high levels ofp16Ink4a, p21, macroH2A,
IL-6, phosphorylated p38MAPK, DSBs, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity.
The use of such methods has provided convincing evidence that senescent cells indeed
accumulate in tissues of humans, primates, and rodents with age77–81, as well as at sites of
tissue injury and remodelling10–14. Furthermore, cells with senescent cell properties can be
found in the affected tissues of patients with age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis,
pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease1,82.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies on the relevance of in vivo senescence in ageing and age-associated diseases have
also been complicated by the fact that key downstream effectors of senescence-inducing
stressors such as p16Ink4a and p53 are tumour suppressors that, when disrupted in mice,
cause death from cancer at a young age83. p53 provides additional complications to these
analyses as, unlike p16Ink4a, this transcription factor also mediates apoptosis, making it
difficult to assign potential ageing-related phenotypic changes in p53-null animals to the
senescence program84–86. Two consecutive studies in BubR1 progeroid mice, in which
p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells were targeted in different ways provided the first direct
support for Hayflick and Moorhead’s early concept that senescent cells drive age-related
pathologies1,7,15,16. In the first study, genetic inactivation of p16Ink4a prevented the
formation of senescent cells in skeletal muscle, eye and fat, significantly attenuating the
onset of age-related pathologies in these tissues15. In the subsequent study, which produced
a phenocopy of genetic p16Ink4a ablation, p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells were allowed to
accumulate but were consistently eliminated from weaning age onwards by the use of a
transgene, termed INK-ATTAC, that selectively induced apoptosis in these cells upon
administration of the synthetic drug AP20187 (ref. 16). Late-life clearance of senescent cells
attenuated progression of already-established age-related disorders in skeletal muscle and
fat, yet was unable to revert them.
An important question that needs to be addressed is how senescence promotes age-related
tissue dysfunction (Fig. 4). One scenario is that senescence contributes to the overall decline
in tissue regenerative potential that occurs with ageing. This idea is supported by the
observation that progenitor cell populations in both skeletal muscle and fat tissue of BubR1
progeroid mice are highly prone to cellular senescence36. In addition to acting on stem cells
in a cell-autonomous fashion by establishing a persistent growth arrest, senescence could act
to disrupt the local stem-cell niche non-autonomously through the SASP87–89 (Fig. 4).
Although this concept remains to be tested in vivo, the profound negative impact that the
aged cellular microenvironment has on stem cell functionality is underscored by the
discovery that the regenerative potential of old stem cells markedly improves when exposed
to a young systemic environment via parabiotic pairing87,90.

Other SASP-based mechanisms may also contribute to tissue dysfunction. For example,
proteases chronically secreted by senescent cells may perturb tissue structure and
organization by cleaving membrane-bound receptors, signalling ligands, extracellular matrix
proteins or other components in the tissue microenvironment55,91 (Fig. 4). In addition, other
SASP components, including IL-6 and IL-8, may stimulate tissue fibrosis in certain
epithelial tissues by inducing EMT61,91 (Fig. 4). Chronic tissue inflammation, which is
characterized by infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, fibrosis and cell death, is
associated with ageing and has a causal role in the development of various age-related
diseases60. One idea, which remains untested, is that senescent cells that accumulate with
ageing and that are present at sites of age-related pathologies promote this type of
inflammation through the proinflammatory growth factors, cytokines and chemokines they
secrete (Fig. 4). These may include GM-CSF, GROα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, macrophage
inflammatory proteins (MIPs), as well as monocyte chemo-attractant proteins (MCPs)1,49,55.
Together with matrix metalloproteinases, proinflammatory SASP components are thought to
create a tissue microenvironment that promotes survival, proliferation and dissemination of
neoplastic cells, which may explain, at least in part, why cancer rates markedly increase
beyond middle age1,80,84. Finally, the SASP may intensify age-related tissue deterioration
through paracrine senescence, a recently discovered mechanism by which senescent cells
spread the senescence phenotype to healthy neighbouring cells through secretion of IL-1β,
TGFβ and certain chemokine ligands (Fig. 4)92,93.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Why senescent cells accumulate in tissues and organs with age is another key open question.
One possibility is that the rate with which senescent cells are produced might increase over
time. In support of this idea, several investigations have demonstrated that various stimuli
that induce senescence increase with ageing32,94,95. If combined cellular stresses were to
drive senescence, it would take a long time for these to accumulate. Alternatively, the
efficiency with which senescent cells get eliminated may decrease with ageing. In fact,
senescent cells can be killed and disposed of by immune cells, as was elegantly
demonstrated in mice that undergo senescence in the context of liver fibrosis and
hepatocellular carcinogenesis14,96. These observations raised the possibility that senescent
cells are armed with a self-elimination program that proceeds by attracting both adaptive and
innate immune cells, including T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells, through the
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines60,96,97. This program is likely to be
affected in ageing humans and rodents, in which the immune system undergoes a complex
series of changes in both the innate and adaptive immunity that culminate in age-associated
immunodeficiency71. This may include a reduced efficiency of senescent-cell clearance.
Indeed, age-related haematopoietic stem cell dysfunction compromises the immune system
and may thus be an important contributor to the late-life systemic increases in senescent
cells70,98. Furthermore, given that senescence may be a dynamic process rather than a static
state, it is conceivable that the ability to self-eliminate through immune cells becomes
compromised as senescent cells evolve.
Another important consideration is whether chronic and acute senescence can both play a
role in ageing and age-related disease. Acute senescent cells are part of tightly orchestrated
biological processes in which they have narrowly defined roles and a temporal presence both
dictated by the composition of the SASP, limiting their ability to accumulate with ageing. In

contrast, chronic senescent cells which develop after a prolonged period of gradually
increasing cellular stresses are expected to exhibit high SASP heterogeneity due to a more
complex and diverse spectrum of effector pathways involved in establishing this type of
longer lasting senescent state. SASP heterogeneity may therefore be a mechanism to create
subsets of senescent cells that are highly resistant to immune clearance and drive tissue
degeneration.

Senescent-cell clearance and future directions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies in BubR1 progeroid mice provided proof-of-principle that clearance of senescent
cells can delay age-related degenerative pathologies16. This, together with the lack of overt
detrimental side effects associated with long-term clearance in BubR1 mutant mice, suggests
that targeting senescent cells for destruction might be an effective therapeutic strategy for
treatment of age-related diseases or improvement of healthy lifespan. Evidently,
sophisticated approaches developed for selective eradication of cancer cells provide an
invaluable blueprint for the development of molecular-targeted therapies against senescent
cells. The problem of drug resistance that has plagued the cancer field is unlikely to apply to
senolytic agents because rare residual senescent cells that remain after treatment would not
be able to amplify through division.
However, although senescent-cell removal represents an attractive therapeutic avenue, there
are many unknowns and potential pitfalls along this route. For example, our current
knowledge about the rates and spatiotemporal patterns that drive the accumulation of
senescent cells in both humans and animal models during normal ageing and in age-related
diseases is limited. Another gap in knowledge relates to the degree of phenotypic
heterogeneity (that is, SASP composition) between senescent cells that accumulate in vivo,
not only between the acute and chronic senescent cells but also within these two classes.
Also, it will be imperative to determine the impact of senescent cell clearance on the health
and lifespan of normal mice, particularly now that evidence is mounting that senescence is
beneficial for tissue development and repair.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another important consideration is whether the mouse is a reliable model for recapitulating
the physiological effects of senescence cell accumulation and clearance that occurs in
humans. One prominent senescence-inducing stressor, telomere attrition, is specific to
humans, and may be responsible for a higher baseline level of senescence in our species. If
similar to telomere attrition, other senescence-inducing mechanisms were indeed more
prevalent in humans than in mice, the therapeutic effect of senescent cell clearance might be
even more robust than in mice. Conversely, we should consider that, in spite of its potential
beneficial effects, the removal of high percentages of senescent cells could have undesirable
outcomes to human health by triggering atrophy and tissue dysfunction. In addition, the
most illuminating experiments in mice relied on targeting p16Ink4a-positive cells for
elimination, a population that probably represents only a subset of cells undergoing
senescence. Thus, the effects of clearing either p16Ink4a-negative senescent cells or,
collectively, all senescent cells remain to be determined. In addition, cultured human and
mouse cells differentially rely on the p53 and p16Ink4a pathways for induction of
senescence27, underscoring the need for carefully validating information from mouse studies

before extrapolating its results to the human situation. We should also consider that although
the existence of multiple senescent-cell subtypes offers at the same time challenges and
opportunities, targeting each of these populations separately might have either beneficial or
detrimental effects.
The field of experimental therapeutics as it relates to senescence is a nascent yet promising
area of investigation. Besides small molecules that target senescent cells, a potentially
promising and straightforward bio-therapeutic approach would be to activate or reinforce the
immune response against senescent cells. This approach will require a deeper understanding
of the extent to which the immune system disposes of senescent cells as well as the
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process. Potential caveats are that
immunodeficiency is not a main contributor to age-related increases in senescent cells, or
that chronically senescent cells are enriched in SASP components that provide resistance to
immune clearance99. Approaches exploiting the adaptive immune system to mount effective
immunity against senescent cells may have limited feasibility owing to a potential lack of
senescent-cell-specific antigens.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Undoubtedly, the next decade will see a tremendous expansion of data on the mechanisms,
characteristics and functions of in vivo senescence, as well as the use of this information to
ameliorate human age-related diseases and promote healthy lifespan.

Figure 1. Senescence-inducing stimuli and main effector pathways

A variety of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stresses can activate the cellular senescence
program. These stressors engage various cellular signalling cascades but ultimately activate
p53, p16Ink4a, or both. Stress types that activate p53 through DDR signalling are indicated
with grey text and arrows (ROS elicit the DDR by perturbing gene transcription and DNA
replication, as well as by shortening telomeres). Activated p53 induces p21, which induces a
temporal cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin E–Cdk2. p16Ink4a also inhibits cell-cycle
progression but does so by targeting cyclin D–Cdk4 and cyclin D–Cdk6 complexes. Both

p21 and p16Ink4a act by preventing the inactivation of Rb, thus resulting in continued
repression of E2F target genes required for S-phase onset. Upon severe stress (red arrows),
temporally arrested cells transition into a senescent growth arrest through a mechanism that
is currently incompletely understood. Cells exposed to mild damage that can be successfully
repaired may resume normal cell-cycle progression. On the other hand, cells exposed to
moderate stress that is chronic in nature or that leaves permanent damage may resume
proliferation through reliance on stress support pathways (green arrows). This phenomenon
(termed assisted cycling) is enabled by p53-mediated activation of p21. Thus, the p53–p21
pathway can either antagonize or synergize with p16Ink4a in senescence depending on the
type and level of stress. BRAF(V600E) is unusual in that it establishes senescence through a
metabolic effector pathway. BRAF(V600E) activates PDH by inducing PDP2 and inhibiting
PDK1 expression, promoting a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation that
creates senescence-inducing redox stress. Cells undergoing senescence induce an
inflammatory transcriptome regardless of the senescence inducing stress (coloured dots
represent various SASP factors). Red and green connectors indicate ‘senescence-promoting’
and ‘senescence-preventing’ activities, respectively, and their thickness represents their
relative importance. The dashed green connector denotes a ‘senescence-reversing’
mechanism.

Figure 2. Hypothetical multi-step senescence model

Mounting evidence suggests that cellular senescence is a dynamic process driven by
epigenetic and genetic changes. The initial step represents the progression from a transient
to a stable cell-cycle arrest through sustained activation of the p16Ink4a and/or p53–p21
pathways. The resulting early senescent cells progress to full senescence by downregulating
lamin B1, thereby triggering extensive chromatin remodelling underlying the production of
a SASP. Certain components of the SASP are highly conserved (grey dots), whereas others
may vary depending on cell type, nature of the senescence-inducing stressor, or cell-to-cell
variability in chromatin remodelling (red and green dots). Progression to deep or late
senescence may be driven by additional genetic and epigenetic changes, including chromatin
budding, histone proteolysis and retrotransposition, driving further transcriptional change
and SASP heterogeneity (yellow, magenta, pink and blue dots). It should be emphasized that

although the exact nature, number and order of the genetic and epigenetic steps occurring
during senescent cell evolution are unclear, it is reasonable to assume that the entire process
is prone to SASP heterogeneity. The efficiency with which immune cells (yellow) dispose of
senescent cells may be dependent on the composition of the SASP. Interestingly, the
proinflammatory signature of the SASP can fade due to expression of particular microRNAs
late into the senescence program, thereby perhaps allowing evasion of immuno-clearance99.

Figure 3. Acute and chronic senescent cells

The conceptual model in which senescent cells are subdivided into two main classes based
on kinetics of senescence induction and functionality. Acute senescent cells seem to mostly
be part of tightly orchestrated biological processes (that is, wound healing, tissue repair,
embryonic development) to halt expansion of certain cells and/or produce a SASP with
defined paracrine functions. Acute senescence is induced through cell-extrinsic stimuli that
target a specific population of cells in the tissue. Acute senescent cells self-organize their
elimination through SASP components that attract various types of immune cells. Induction
of chronic senescence occurs after periods of progressive cellular stress or macromolecular
damage when tarry cycling transitions into a stable cell-cycle arrest. Chronic senescence is

not programmed and does not seem to target specific cell types. Conceivably, owing to agerelated immunodeficiency or production of less proinflammatory SASPs, immune cells may
inefficiently eliminate chronic senescent cells, allowing continuation of multi-step
senescence. Senescence induced during cancer therapy may initially be acute and later
chronic in nature.

Figure 4. Mechanisms of tissue and organ deterioration by cellular senescence

Cellular senescence is thought to contribute to age-related tissue and organ dysfunction and
various chronic age-related diseases through various mechanisms. In a cell-autonomous
manner, senescence acts to deplete the various pools of cycling cells in an organism,
including stem and progenitor cells. In this way, senescence interferes with tissue
homeostasis and regeneration, and lays the groundwork for its cell-non-autonomous
detrimental actions involving the SASP. There are at least five distinct paracrine
mechanisms by which senescent cells could promote tissue dysfunction, including
perturbation of the stem cell niche (causing stem cell dysfunction), disruption of
extracellular matrix, induction of aberrant cell differentiation (both creating abnormal tissue
architecture), stimulation of sterile tissue inflammation, and induction of senescence in

neighbouring cells (paracrine senescence). An emerging yet untested concept is that postmitotic, terminally differentiated cells that develop key properties of senescent cells might
contribute to ageing and age-related disease through the same set of paracrine mechanisms.
