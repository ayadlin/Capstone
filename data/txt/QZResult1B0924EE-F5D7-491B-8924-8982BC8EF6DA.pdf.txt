Abstract
Topotecan is a substrate of the ATP-binding cassette transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). To define the role of these transporters in
topotecan penetration into the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid
(vCSF) and brain parenchymal extracellular fluid (ECF)
compartments, we performed intracerebral microdialysis on
transporter-deficient mice after an intravenous dose of topotecan (4 mg/kg). vCSF penetration of unbound topotecan
lactone was measured as the ratio of vCSF-to-plasma area
under the concentration-time curves. The mean F SD ratios for
wild-type, Mdr1a/b /, Bcrp1 /, and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 /
mice were 3.07 F 0.09, 2.57 F 0.17, 1.63 F 0.12, and 0.86 F 0.05,
respectively. In contrast, the ECF-to-plasma ratios for
wild-type, Bcrp1 /, and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice were
0.36 F 0.06, 0.42 F 0.06, and 0.88 F 0.07. Topotecan lactone
was below detectable limits in the ECF of Mdr1a/b / mice.
When gefitinib (200 mg/kg) was preadministered to inhibit
Bcrp1 and P-gp, the vCSF-to-plasma ratio decreased to
1.29 F 0.09 in wild-type mice and increased to 1.13 F 0.13 in
Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice, whereas the ECF-to-plasma ratio
increased to 0.74 F 0.14 in wild-type and 1.07 F 0.03 in
Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice. Preferential active transport of
topotecan lactone over topotecan carboxylate was shown
in vivo by vCSF lactone-to-carboxylate area under the curve
ratios for wild-type, Mdr1a/b /, Bcrp1 /, and Mdr1a/b /
Bcrp1 / mice of 5.69 F 0.83, 3.85 F 0.64, 3.61 F 0.46, and
0.78 F 0.19, respectively. Our results suggest that Bcrp1 and
P-gp transport topotecan into vCSF and out of brain parenchyma through the blood-brain barrier. These findings may
help to improve pharmacologic strategies to treat brain
tumors. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5885–92]

Introduction
Malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors carry a poor
prognosis and are the most common solid tumors in children (1).
Surgical resection and radiotherapy have been the cornerstones of
treatment for most brain tumors, but chemotherapy is gaining an
equally important role. In children ages <3 years, chemotherapy is

preferentially given to avoid or delay irradiation of the developing
brain (2). Because drugs approved for adults, such as temozolomide, have not shown efficacy in pediatric trials (3), new agents are
needed to treat childhood brain tumors.
Camptothecin analogues (topotecan and irinotecan) exerted
potent antitumor activity in xenograft models of human primary
CNS tumors, including glioma, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma (4–6). Subsequent research in nonhuman primates showed
that topotecan readily penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF; ref. 7), and clinical trials showed the activity of topotecan
against pediatric CNS tumors that are disseminated through the
subarachnoidal space (8). However, topotecan given as a single
agent has shown no activity against high-grade gliomas in children
(9, 10). These disparate results may be explained in part by different
drug penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the bloodCSF barrier (BCB; ref. 11).
Among the functional components of the BBB and the BCB
( for reviews, see refs. 12–14), proteins of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter family appear to play a significant role in
transporting topotecan (15, 16) and are likely to affect its
distribution in the brain parenchyma and CSF compartments
(17–19). The ABC transporters are expressed in the brain vascular
endothelial cells in the BBB and in the monolayer of ependymal
cells of the choroid plexus in the BCB (20). They can also be present
on the surface of tumor cells, and several in vitro studies have
shown that tumors overexpressing the ABC transporters human
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2), P-glycoprotein
(P-gp/MDR1/ABCB1), or multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4/
ABCC4) are resistant to topotecan (21–23).
Transgenic rodent models in which specific transporters are
deleted provide a powerful tool for examining the roles of
individual transporters in the brain distribution of drugs. Our
previous studies in a Mrp4-deficient mouse model suggested that
Mrp4 reduces topotecan penetration into the ventricular CSF
(vCSF; ref. 18). However, we observed very high vCSF accumulation
of topotecan in wild-type mice (17), strongly suggesting that other
drug transporters actively move topotecan from the brain
parenchyma or blood into the vCSF. As topotecan is also a
substrate of Bcrp1 and P-gp (16, 23, 24), these two transporters are
likely to be responsible for the robust movement of topotecan
across the BCB. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed the
expression of Bcrp1 on the apical side of the ependymal cells of the
choroid plexus and the uniform presence of P-gp in the ependymal
cell cytoplasm. We also confirmed that gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, impedes topotecan transport into the CSF probably by
inhibiting the ABC transporters at the BCB (17).
In the present study, we examined the individual roles of Bcrp1
and P-gp at the BBB and BCB by using knockout mouse models

lacking Bcrp1, P-gp, or both proteins, gefitinib as a potent inhibitor
of the ABC transporters, and an intracerebral microdialysis
sampling technique. We found that the presence of these proteins
at the BBB and BCB explains the transport of topotecan into the
vCSF and the efflux of topotecan from the brain parenchyma. These
findings improve our understanding of active mechanisms
regulating drug penetration into the CNS and enhance our ability
to develop more effective brain tumor chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and chemicals. Topotecan hydrochloride (Hycamtin; GlaxoSmithKline) was prepared in sterile water (1 mg/mL). Gefitinib tablets
(Iressa; AstraZeneca; 250 mg) were pulverized, and the powder was
reconstituted with 0.5% Tween 20 (20%, v/v) and suspended in carboxymethylcellulose (0.25%, w/v) to a final concentration of 40 mg/mL. All other
solvents and chemicals used were analytical grade or better.
Animals. FVB wild-type, Bcrp1 /, Mdr1a/b /, and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 /
female mice weighing 20 to 25 g were purchased from Taconic. All gene
knockouts were created on the FVB genetic background. All procedures were
approved by the St. Jude Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
met the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care.
Topotecan plasma protein binding. Topotecan lactone plasma protein
binding was determined as reported previously (17). The unbound fraction
was calculated as the proportion of unbound plasma topotecan lactone to
total plasma topotecan lactone.
Cannula implantation for microdialysis. The implantation of a guide
cannula in anesthetized mice for microdialysis study of vCSF (25) or
extracellular fluid (ECF; refs. 17, 26) has been reported. Briefly, for vCSF
microdialysis, a MD-2255 guide cannula (Bioanalytical Systems) was
inserted into the lateral ventricle at an angle of 20j posterior (1 mm
lateral, 0.8 mm posterior, and 2 mm ventral to the bregma point). For ECF
microdialysis, the guide cannula was inserted vertically into the striatum
(1.8 mm lateral, 0.6 mm anterior, and 2 mm ventral to the bregma point).
Mice were then allowed 3 to 5 days to recover.
Microdialysis studies. The microdialysis procedure and probe calibration have been described in detail (17, 26). Briefly, on the day of an
experiment, the microdialysis probe (MD-2211; Bioanalytical Systems) was
primed and flushed with artificial CSF (27). The probe was inserted through
the cannula into the brain lateral ventricle or striatum, and the artificial
CSF perfusion rate was set at 0.5 AL/min. The probe was allowed to
equilibrate in vivo for at least 1 h. Topotecan (4 mg/kg) was then
administered by intravenous bolus via the lateral tail vein. Gefitinibpretreated animals received a 200 mg/kg gefitinib dose by oral gavage
1 h before topotecan. After the injection of topotecan, the dialysate samples
were directly loaded onto a sample loop (2 AL) and topotecan lactone and
carboxylate were simultaneously analyzed through an online microbore
high-performance liquid chromatography system until topotecan concentration was undetectable (26). Topotecan carboxylate and lactone concentrations in ECF or vCSF were first corrected for the hydrolysis of topotecan
lactone in pH 7.4 artificial CSF using previously described method (26).
Probe recovery was determined by the in vivo retrodialysis method after
each experiment (26). After the microdialysis experiment, the mice were
euthanized and their brains were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
24 h and embedded in paraffin. H&E-stained sections (4 Am) were
examined microscopically to confirm the location of the microdialysis
probe track. Three to six animals were used for each condition studied.
Topotecan plasma pharmacokinetics. As in our previous murine
microdialysis studies (17), we assessed plasma population pharmacokinetics in a preliminary group of mice. These results were then used as a prior
distribution when assessing individual mouse plasma pharmacokinetics
with limited sampling in the microdialysis studies. We estimated the plasma
population pharmacokinetic parameters in each genotype and treatment
group (topotecan 4 mg/kg intravenously alone versus after pretreatment
with oral gefitinib 200 mg/kg) as described previously (17). Briefly, each

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

preliminary study included six to seven mice, and blood was sampled from
each mouse randomly at four of five time points (0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and
6 h after drug administration chosen based on our previous experience with
topotecan murine pharmacokinetic studies) either by retro-orbital bleed or
(at the final time point) by cardiac puncture. Sample processing and
topotecan lactone and carboxylate bioanalysis have been reported in detail.
A two-compartment model was used to describe the topotecan lactone data
and a third compartment was included to account for the topotecan
carboxylate, and the population parameters were estimated by nonlinear
mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM version VI; refs. 28, 29).
For each microdialysis experiment, three plasma samples were collected
from the retro-orbital plexus (0.25, 1, and 3 h after topotecan administration; ref. 17) for plasma pharmacokinetic analysis. The above-described
plasma pharmacokinetic model for topotecan was fit to the plasma
topotecan lactone and carboxylate concentration-time data using maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimation (with the prior parameter
distribution determined above) as implemented in ADAPT II (30). The
plasma area under the curve (AUC) from zero time to infinity (AUC 0!1) for
unbound topotecan lactone and carboxylate was calculated by integration
of the simulated concentration-time data from the model estimates. These
simulated plasma AUCs were used to calculate the plasma lactone-tocarboxylate ratio of unbound topotecan.
Three-compartment analysis of combined plasma and brain
topotecan lactone pharmacokinetic data. A three-compartment
pharmacokinetic model (two compartments to describe the plasma
topotecan lactone and one for the microdialysis obtained brain unbound
topotecan lactone concentrations) was fit to the vCSF or ECF data.
Specifically, topotecan lactone plasma pharmacokinetic parameters
including volume of central compartment (Vc), systemic clearance (CLt),
volume of peripheral compartment (Vp), and intercompartmental
clearance (CLp) for each mouse were fixed at the values obtained by
the methods described in the above section. Then, the model parameters
describing the brain disposition (CLin, CLout, and VECF or VCSF) were
estimated by maximum likelihood estimation via ADAPT II (17, 31). The
vCSF or ECF AUC 0!1 for unbound topotecan lactone was calculated by
integration of the simulated concentration-time data from the model
estimates.
CNS penetration estimation. The CNS penetration of topotecan lactone
was measured as the ratio of the unbound topotecan lactone AUC in brain
ECF (AUCu,ECF) or vCSF (AUCu,vCSF) to that in plasma (AUCu,plasma; ref. 31).
The CLin-to-CLout ratio is also considered to express the extent of CNS
penetration of topotecan lactone in the three-compartment analysis (32).
Thus, we compared the topotecan penetration estimates calculated by both
approaches based on the relationship AUCbrain/AUCplasma = CLin/CLout (32).
Immunohistochemistry. The brains of FVB wild-type, Bcrp1 /, and
Mdr1a/b / mice were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin. The presence of Bcrp1 was immunohistochemically
assessed in the sectioned tissues as reported previously (17). The area and
intensity of staining in digital images was quantified using NIH ImageJ
software. After background subtraction, the stained area was assessed by
setting the threshold of the red channel of each image at 4 SDs below the
mean pixel intensity and calculating the integrated intensity of the selected
area. Bcrp1 staining area and intensity values were normalized to the mean
values of negative control slides.
In vitro study of topotecan lactone and carboxylate transport by
BCRP. To assess BCRP transport of topotecan lactone and carboxylate,
BCRP-expressing Saos2 cells (Saos-BCRP; ref. 23) and Saos2-pcDNA control
cells were incubated with topotecan at different pH values to shift
the distribution of the lactone (pH 6) and carboxylate (pH 8) forms. Cells
(1  106) were incubated in DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine)
in 10 cm2 dishes for 16 h at 37jC. The medium was carefully aspirated and
the cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 6 or 8). For topotecan treatment at
pH 6, a topotecan stock solution in DMSO was diluted to 500 ng/mL in pH 6
PBS (37jC). For topotecan treatment at pH 8, a topotecan stock solution in
0.4 N borax solution was diluted to 500 ng/mL in pH 8 PBS (37jC). The
prepared topotecan treatment solutions (8 mL) were added to each 10 cm2
dish (n = 3). After incubation for 1 or 30 min at 37jC without CO2, the

treatment medium was removed, the plate was washed once with 5 mL cold
PBS at pH 6 or 8, respectively, 1 mL PBS at pH 6 or 8 was added to the dishes,
and the cells were detached by using a cell scraper. The cells were then
ultrasonically lysed (10 s  3). The lysate (200 AL) was added to 800 AL cold
methanol for topotecan extraction to determine the intracellular drug

concentration. Proteins in the remaining lysate were quantified by
colorimetric assay (Dc Protein Assay; Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Statistics. In cases where two groups were compared, a Student’s t test
was done. For the comparison of more than two groups, a one-way ANOVA
was done followed by a post hoc t test with Bonferroni correction.

Results
Topotecan lactone plasma protein binding. The mean F SD
unbound fraction of plasma topotecan lactone was 30.1 F 1.0% in
wild-type, 29.2 F 2.7% in Mdr1a/b /, 30.9 F 2.2% in Bcrp1 /,
and 27.5 F 1.9% in Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice. One-way ANOVA
showed no significant difference among these results (P = 0.10).
Bcrp1 and P-gp enhance topotecan lactone penetration into
the vCSF and decrease penetration into the brain ECF. For
these studies, a microdialysis probe was placed in the lateral
ventricle or the brain parenchymal tissue of each mouse, and
proper placement was verified by postmortem histologic examination (Supplementary Fig. S1). After a single 4 mg/kg topotecan
intravenous bolus injection, the mean F SD vCSF-to-plasma ratio
of unbound topotecan lactone (AUCu,vCSF/ AUCu,plasma) was 3.07 F
0.09 in wild-type, 2.57 F 0.17 in Mdr1a/b /, 1.63 F 0.12 in
Bcrp1 /, and 0.86 F 0.05 in Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice (Fig. 1).
The mean F SD in vivo probe recovery in these groups was
8.1 F 2.4%, 7.1 F 1.1%, 7.5 F 1.5%, and 6.0 F 0.6%, respectively. The
CLin-to-CLout ratio at the BCB was consistent with the AUC ratio
(Table 1).
The mean F SD ECF-to-plasma AUC ratios (AUCu,ECF/
AUCu,plasma) of unbound topotecan lactone were 0.36 F 0.06 in
wild-type, 0.42 F 0.06 in Bcrp1 /, and 0.89 F 0.07 in Mdr1a/b //
Bcrp1 / mice (Fig. 2). The topotecan lactone ECF concentrations
in Mdr1a/b / mice were below the lower limit of detection of the
assay. The in vivo probe recovery (mean F SD) in these groups was
8.5 F 2.4%, 5.4 F 0.6%, and 4.3 F 0.2%, respectively. The CLin-toCLout ratio at the BBB was consistent with the AUC ratio (Table 1).
Effect of gefitinib on topotecan penetration of vCSF and ECF.
After gefitinib pretreatment, no significant difference in topotecan
lactone vCSF penetration (mean F SD AUCu,vCSF/AUCu,plasma)
was noted between wild-type and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice
(Fig. 3; 1.29 F 0.09 versus 1.13 F 0.13; P = 0.147, Student’s t test),
suggesting that gefitinib fully inhibited Bcrp1 and P-gp function at
the BCB. For the BBB, mean F SD AUCu,ECF/AUCu,plasma ratios
differed significantly between wild-type and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 /
mice (Fig. 3; 0.74 F 0.14 versus 1.07 F 0.03; P < 0.05, Student’s t test).
Preferential transport of topotecan lactone into the vCSF.
We investigated whether unbound topotecan lactone would be
preferentially transported in vivo. The mean F SD vCSF lactone-tocarboxylate AUC ratio (AUClactone,vCSF/AUCcarboxylate,vCSF) was 5.7 F
0.8 in wild-type, 3.9 F 0.6 in Mdr1a/b /, 3.6 F 0.5 in Bcrp1 /,
and 0.8 F 0.2 in Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice. The ratios of the
knockout groups were significantly different compared with the
wild-type group (P = 0.003 for Mdr1a/b / and Bcrp1 /
mice and P < 0.001 for Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice, ANOVA
with post hoc t test with Bonferroni correction). The mean F SD
plasma lactone-to-carboxylate AUC ratio (AUClactone,plasma/
AUCcarboxylate,plasma) was not significantly different between
wild-type and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice (1.24 F 0.38 versus
0.95 F 0.28; P = 0.11, Student’s t test). Different AUClactone/
AUCcarboxylate ratios in vCSF but similar ones in plasma suggest the
preferential active transport of topotecan lactone across the BCB
by these ABC transporters.
Saos2-BCRP cells transport topotecan lactone. To determine
whether BCRP is capable of specifically transporting topotecan
lactone, we evaluated topotecan lactone efflux in cells overexpressing BCRP. After a 1-min incubation with topotecan lactone
(stable at pH 6), the mean F SD intracellular topotecan lactone
concentration was significantly higher in Saos2-pcDNA cells than

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

in Saos2-BCRP cells (0.063 F 0.01 versus 0.043 F 0.005 ng/Ag
protein; P = 0.05, Student’s t test). A similar difference was observed
after a 30-min incubation at the same pH (0.039 F 0.003 ng/Ag in
Saos2-pcDNA versus 0.026 F 0.004 ng/Ag in Saos2-BCRP cells;
P = 0.05). Topotecan carboxylate was not detected at pH 6. We
observed no difference in intracellular topotecan carboxylate
accumulation between Saos2-pcDNA and Saos2-BCRP cells at pH
8 (data not shown).

mice were below the lower limit of detection, we hypothesized
that Bcrp1 protein might be overexpressed in these animals,
thereby increasing the overall drug efflux into the brain
microvessels. A semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis
of Bcrp1 expression in the microvascular endothelium in wildtype and Mdr1a/b / mice showed greater expression in the
Mdr1a/b / mice, with no apparent differences in vessel density
(Fig. 4).

Discussion
The active transport mechanisms that control topotecan
penetration and pharmacokinetics in different CNS compartments
have not been well described previously. By using our modified
surgical procedure (25), microdialysis sampling, transporterdeficient mice, and pharmacokinetic modeling, we elucidated the
roles of Bcrp1 and P-gp in the differential penetration of the CNS
barriers by topotecan. Although these transporters enhanced the
entry of topotecan into the CSF through the BCB, they restricted
exposure of parenchymal brain to topotecan by acting as efflux
transporters at the BBB. Our results may be clinically relevant in
several ways. First, they may explain why topotecan is more active
against CNS tumors that spread via leptomeningeal route than
those located in the brain hemispheres. Second, they indicate that
the use of CSF drug levels to predict CNS penetration warrants

reconsideration. Finally, our results may help to predict the effects
of ABC transporter inhibitors on the efficacy of chemotherapy for
CNS tumors.
Our results suggest that Bcrp1 plays a major role, whereas P-gp
plays a lesser role in transporting topotecan into the vCSF. Both
proteins are present in the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus
(17, 33, 34), and the role of P-gp in the active efflux of potentially
toxic substances into the CSF has been described (33, 35). However,
ours is the first study to show that Bcrp1 plays a significant role in
this BCB-mediated protective mechanism. There appeared to be no
functional redundancy between Bcrp1 and P-gp at the BCB in our
mouse models, as animals deficient in either protein showed a
correspondingly reduced topotecan vCSF penetration. Interestingly,
the vCSF-to-plasma AUC ratio in Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice was
<1.0, which suggests active efflux from the vCSF compartment (31).
This result may be explained by our previous finding that Mrp4
mediates efflux of topotecan from vCSF, a mechanism that opposes
Bcrp1 and P-gp activity at the BCB (18).
In studies of the BBB penetration of topotecan, the loss of either
transporter appeared to be compensated or even surpassed by
overexpression of the other (Fig. 2). The nondeleted transporter
may have been up-regulated at the BBB in these mice. In the
Mdr1a / model, for example, Bcrp1 mRNA is reportedly upregulated 3-fold in the cerebral microvessels (36), which is
consistent with the stronger Bcrp1 staining we observed in
Mdr1a/b / mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4). Although

Bcrp1 protein in whole-brain tissue homogenates was recently
reported not to be overexpressed in the Mdr1a/b / murine model
compared with wild-type mice (19), the change in protein
expression in the microvasculature is likely to have been masked
in that study’s Western blots of whole-brain homogenates. In the
Bcrp1 / model, the ECF-to-plasma AUC ratio was comparable
with that in the wild-type mice. To our knowledge, these are the
first findings to suggest compensatory mechanisms for the loss of
Bcrp1 function. Our results agree with those of previous studies
using the Bcrp1 / mouse model, which found no increased BBB
penetration in vivo by drugs that are Bcrp1 substrates in vitro
(19, 37). Compensatory up-regulation of the nondeleted transporter
would mean that neither the Mdr1a/b / nor the Bcrp1 / model
can reliably be used to distinguish the roles of P-gp or Bcrp1 in BBB
transport in vivo. Therefore, results obtained using animal models
with single-transporter deletions should be interpreted cautiously.
However, the significantly higher ECF-to-plasma AUC ratio of
unbound topotecan lactone in the Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice
compared with wild-type mice in our study (Table 1) reveals that

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

P-gp and Bcrp1 work together in restricting topotecan penetration
through the BBB.
The markedly different ECF and vCSF topotecan penetration we
observed highlights the limitations of using CSF sampling or
whole-brain homogenates to study CNS drug penetration. Studies
using total homogenates may misinterpret drug penetration of
brain parenchyma, as they include both protein-bound and
unbound drug fractions from brain vessels, brain ECF, brain CSF,
and brain intracellular fluid. A recently published study used the
total (lactone + carboxylate) topotecan concentration values in
whole-brain homogenates from knockout animals to define the
roles of P-gp and Bcrp1 in brain penetration, concluding that both
transporters act together at the BBB and inhibit topotecan
penetration of the brain (19). However, this method was unable
to define intercompartmental drug kinetics. Several studies have
shown differential drug distribution in CSF compared with brain
ECF. For example, Venkatakrishnan and colleagues found that
CP-615,003, a GABAA receptor agonist confirmed to be a P-gp
substrate, accumulates in rat CSF 7-fold higher than in ECF (38).

Topotecan Distribution in Brain Parenchyma and CSF

Similar reports about other drugs are available (39, 40). It was
recently postulated that the CSF-to-plasma ratio of free drug can be
used to estimate the brain parenchymal penetration of highly
permeant drugs that are not efflux transporter substrates (41).
Interestingly, we observed preferential active transport in vivo of
the active topotecan lactone over the inactive carboxylate.
Transport of topotecan lactone by human BCRP was also
confirmed in vitro. In contrast, topotecan carboxylate transport
by BCRP was not detected, although at pH 8 (required to stabilize
the carboxylate in our in vitro experiment), the activity of BCRP
could be altered (42). These findings highlight the relevance of
pharmacologic strategies that target topotecan transporters to
modulate the concentration of active drug in the treated tissues.
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib provides an example. In our
previous studies, gefitinib increased oral absorption and decreased
systemic clearance of topotecan and irinotecan (23, 43). In the
present study, we hypothesized that if gefitinib fully inhibits Bcrp1
and P-gp function at the BBB or BCB, similar topotecan AUC ratios
would be observed in wild-type and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice
treated with gefitinib. The wild-type and Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 /
mice did have similar AUC ratios in the BCB penetration study, but
in the BBB comparisons the brain-to-plasma ratio was significantly
greater in Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice. Assuming that other
unknown transport mechanisms at the BBB are equal in both
mouse models, this finding suggests that gefitinib can fully
inhibit Bcrp1 and P-gp at the BCB but not at the BBB (see
Supplementary Text for analysis). Alternatively, transport mechanisms other than P-gp and Bcrp1 may act differently either
at the BCB, the BBB, or both barriers of the wild-type and
Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice. Such putative transport mechanisms
appear to be active at the BCB of the Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice,
because a significant increase in topotecan vCSF penetration was
noted when these animals received gefitinib (see representative
plots for Mdr1a/b /Bcrp1 / mice in Figs. 1 and 3). This finding
may reflect either gefitinib inhibition of ABC transporters, the
action of which opposes that of P-gp and Bcrp1 at the BCB
(e.g., Mrp4; ref. 18), or the widespread presence of the organic anion
transporter and organic anion-transporting peptides at the BBB
and BCB in rodents (20, 44, 45). OAT3 is present in the renal
basolateral membrane, where it enhances renal tubular secretion of
topotecan carboxylate in the rat (46). In vitro studies have found

that human OAT3 transports topotecan carboxylate (46). Because
it is localized on the apical border of the choroid plexus at the
BCB and on endothelial cells at the BBB in rats and mice (47),
OAT3 could oppose the transport functions of Bcrp1 and P-gp
but cooperate with that of Mrp4 to restrict topotecan penetration
into CSF. Similarly, human OATP1B1 can mediate uptake of
SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) in the liver (48).
Although human OATP1B1 is not known to be expressed in the
CNS, rat OATP2 (its counterpart) is found on both apical and
basolateral sides of brain capillary endothelial cells and on the
basolateral side of choroid plexus epithelial cells. Therefore, it
may enhance topotecan penetration of the CSF, as do Bcrp1 and
P-gp (49).
To summarize, topotecan influx into the vCSF and efflux from
the brain parenchyma via the ECF are driven by the transporters
P-gp and Bcrp1 in a manner consistent with their cellular
orientation at the BCB and BBB. The blockade of P-gp and Bcrp1
activity by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors reverses these
effects, causing topotecan depletion in the vCSF and accumulation
in the ECF. Although this study focused on a specific drug, we will
use the same methods and models for investigations aimed at
improving other chemotherapies for CNS tumors located in
specific CNS compartments. Increasing evidence shows that
histologically identical brain tumors can differ molecularly
according to the site of origin of their precursors in the brain
and thus may differ in their susceptibility to molecularly targeted
chemotherapy agents (50). We propose that the site-specific
penetration of candidate agents should be considered when
selecting optimal chemotherapy treatments.
