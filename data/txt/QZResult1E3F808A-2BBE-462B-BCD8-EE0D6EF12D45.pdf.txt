Abstract
Mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl are the most
common cause of resistance to therapy with imatinib in
patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Secondgeneration Bcr-Abl inhibitors are able to overcome most
imatinib-resistant mutants, with the exception of the frequent
T315I substitution, which is emerging as a major cause of
resistance to these drugs in CML patients. Structural studies
could be used to support the drug design process for the
development of inhibitors able to target the T315I substitution, but until now no crystal structure of the T315I Abl
mutant has been solved. We show here the first crystal
structure of the kinase domain of Abl T315I in complex with
PHA-739358, an Aurora kinase inhibitor currently in clinical
development for solid and hematologic malignancies. This
compound inhibits in vitro the kinase activity of wild-type Abl
and of several mutants, including T315I. The cocrystal
structure of T315I Abl kinase domain provides the structural
basis for this activity: the inhibitor associates with an active
conformation of the kinase domain in the ATP-binding pocket
and lacks the steric hindrance imposed by the substitution of
threonine by isoleucine. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):7987–90]

Introduction
Imatinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that targets the tyrosine
kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, is the first-line treatment for patients
with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; ref. 1). Newly diagnosed
patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib generally achieve
durable responses, whereas patients in advanced phases of CML
frequently develop resistance to imatinib therapy, which is often
due to the emergence of mutant forms of Bcr-Abl bearing point
mutations in the kinase domain (1).
Crystallographic studies provided a rationale for the mechanisms by which mutant forms of Bcr-Abl were resistant to therapy.
Imatinib binds and stabilizes an inactive conformation of the Abl
kinase, in which the inhibitor interacts with the aromatic side
chain of the conserved Phe of the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif,
displacing the activation loop from its normal position and forcing
it to adopt a substrate-like conformation, termed the ‘‘DFG-out’’
conformation (2). Mutations in the kinase domain of Abl that cause
imatinib resistance either directly interfere with the inhibitor

interaction or prevent the adoption of this inactive conformation
required for imatinib binding.
Second-generation ATP-competitive Bcr-Abl inhibitors that are
capable of targeting the majority of imatinib-resistant mutants are
currently in clinical development, but none is able to target the
T315I mutant (3–5). The T315I substitution is one of the most
common mutations found in imatinib-resistant patients and the
clinical importance of this mutation is expected to grow because it
is predicted to represent the major mechanism of resistance to
second-generation inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib (6–8).
Therefore, inhibitors that target the T315I mutation are needed to
address this emerging unmet medical need in CML. Two ATPcompetitive inhibitors that were designed to target the Aurora
kinases and are in clinical development, MK-0457 (VX-680) and
PHA-739358, have been reported to be active on T315I Abl mutant
(9). Indeed, MK-0457 is active ex vivo against cells from patients
bearing the Abl T315I mutation (10) and clinical activity on
patients with T315I mutated Abl has been reported (11). A crystal
structure of this inhibitor with another mutant of Abl (H396P), but
not with T315I, has been solved (10).
In this report, we describe the first crystal structure of the
catalytic domain of the Abl T315I mutant in complex with PHA739358. Our results provide a possible structural explanation for
the activity of PHA-739358 on the T315I mutation.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and characterization. The kinase
domain of human c-Abl (residues 229–512, Abl-1a isoform) was expressed in
High5 insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector based on pVL1393
(Invitrogen) to express an NH2-terminally HisGST-tagged protein. The
imatinib-resistant mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis
using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
For protein purification, cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, 20 mmol/L DTT,
10% glycerol, protease inhibitors) and cleared lysates were loaded on a
glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column. For preparation
of dephosphorylated protein, resin-bound protein was incubated for 2 h at
30jC with YopH phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant proteins were
cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted.
Molecular weight and phosphorylation levels of all proteins were
analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Nondephosphorylated wild-type (WT) and mutant Abl kinase domain
proteins yielded a distribution of forms with different phosphorylation
levels, ranging from a prevalent 1P form to more highly phosphorylated
forms. Phosphorylation of Tyr393 in the activation loop was confirmed by
immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Abl-Tyr393 (Cell Signaling). YopHtreated WT kinase domain was entirely unphosphorylated.
Crystallography. The complex of Abl T315I with PHA-739358 was prepared
essentially as described (2). The protein was crystallized using the hanging drop
technique. Crystals were grown at 4jC mixing equal volumes of the protein

solution with the well solution consisting of 20% polyethylene glycol 4000,
1 mol/L HEPES (pH 7.0), and 0.1 mol/L MgCl2.
Data were collected at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline
ID14-EH1 and processed using the HKL package (12). The structure was
solved by molecular replacement with AmoRe (13) using the structure of
Abl in complex with PD173955 (PDB ID 1M52) as the search model. Model
building of the protein and inhibitor was carried out with O (14). Initial
refinement was done with CNX (15), whereas the final round of refinement
was done with Refmac (13).
A summary of the diffraction data and the refinement statistics is shown
in Supplementary Table S1. Protein coordinates have been deposited in the
protein databank with code 2v7a.
Abl kinase assay. Reaction mixtures (total volume, 20 AL) containing
15 nmol/L of enzyme, 10 Amol/L myelin basic protein as substrate (SigmaAldrich), 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L MnCl2,
1 mmol/L DTT, 15 nmol/L Na3VO4, 4% DMSO, 3 Amol/L ATP, 0.1 ACi
[g-32P]ATP, and the indicated amount of inhibitors were incubated for 30 min
at 30jC. Reactions were terminated by addition of gel loading buffer and
loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radioactive signals on resolved,
dried gels were revealed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager.
ATP site-dependent displacement assay. Serial dilutions of test
compounds were prepared in assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L MnCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT,
3 Amol/L Na3VO4]. The enzymes were present at a final concentration of
10 nmol/L. The probe was used at concentrations equal to 10-fold the K D
for each of the protein tested (2, 3.3, 1.5, 0.2, and 0.8 Amol/L, respectively, for
Abl WT 0P, WT, E255V, T315I, and M351T). The mixture of enzyme and
probe was added to the already diluted compounds to have a final reaction
mixture of 70 AL directly in a black 384-well plate (Corning). Plates were
read on a fusion a-FP HT (Packard) with excitation 425/20 nm and
emission 525/20 nm with fluorescence intensity. Data analysis was done
using Dynafit.

Results and Discussion
In vitro inhibition of WT and imatinib-resistant Abl mutants
by PHA-739358. PHA-739358 has been identified and was
developed as an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the Aurora kinases
(16). The inhibitor shows high antitumor activity in vivo (16),

with favorable chemico-physical and pharmacokinetic properties,
and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in solid and
hematologic malignancies, including CML. PHA-739358 showed a
significant cross-reactivity with Abl in a biochemical assay, with an
IC50 of 25 nmol/L (16). We tested whether PHA-739358 was capable
of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of the imatinib-resistant
Abl mutants in a biochemical kinase assay using WT Abl kinase
domain in parallel with three of the most frequent imatinibresistant mutants: T315I, E255V, and M351T (1). As shown in Fig. 1,
as expected, imatinib was active only on WT Abl, being more active
on the dephosphorylated protein (2). The E255V and T315I
mutants were insensitive, whereas the M351T mutant showed
inhibition only at high imatinib concentration, in agreement with
previous data reporting that this mutant is not completely
insensitive to imatinib (17). On the contrary, PHA-739358 efficiently
inhibits substrate phosphorylation by WT and mutant proteins,
being even more active against the T315I mutant (Fig. 1).
To confirm and quantify the in vitro kinase assay data, an ATP
site-dependent displacement assay was set up for the quantitative
affinity evaluation for recombinant WT and Abl kinase domain
mutants. The assay is based on the significant increase in
fluorescence intensity due to indolinone binding to the Abl kinase
domains. Because indolinones show extremely low levels of
fluorescence per se, the change in intensity provides a direct
readout of the extent of probe binding to Abl kinase domains.
The probe used is capable of binding all forms of the Abl kinase
domain with high affinities (0.22, 0.33, 0.15, 0.02, and 0.08 Amol/L,
respectively, for Abl WT 0P, WT phosphorylated, E255V, T315I,
and M351T) with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The Z¶ evaluated at
10 nmol/L proteins and saturating probe concentrations were
above 0.8 (data not shown). ATPgS competes with the probe for
binding to Abl kinase domains, resulting in a decrease in
fluorescence intensity in comparison with the probe alone. The
full displacement by ATPgS indicates that the indolinone binds in
the ATP pocket. In agreement, binding constants (K D) were
determined by fitting with a pure competitive mechanism.
Inhibitor affinities for different Abl forms measured using this
assay are shown in Table 1. Imatinib showed a higher affinity for
the dephosphorylated compared with the phosphorylated form of
Abl (0.021 and 0.23 Amol/L, respectively), whereas no displacement
was observed on the T315I mutant, in agreement with published
data (18). Lower affinity was observed for the E255V and M351T
mutants. On the contrary, MK-0457, an Aurora inhibitor that
exhibits cross-reactivity with Abl (10), binds all forms of Abl with a
similar potency. Similarly, PHA-739358 binds all of the Abl forms,
although with a higher affinity than MK-0457. Furthermore, PHA739358 shows a higher affinity for the T315I mutant (0.005 Amol/L)
in agreement with the kinase activity assay described above.

Structure of PHA-739358 Bound to Abl T315I

Crystal structure of T315I Abl complexed with PHA-739358.
To understand the structural basis of the capability of PHA-739358 to
bind and inhibit the T315I mutant, we determined the crystal
structure of the inhibitor-protein complex (Fig. 2A). The protein is in
the typical conformation of active kinases, with the activation loop
in the extended DFG ‘‘in’’ conformation. Indeed, Asp381 points into
the active site and interacts with Mg2+ ion that occupies a position
similar to the one usually seen in the structures of kinases in complex
with ATP. The glycine loop adopts an extended conformation, in
contrast to the other publicly available Abl structures where the loop
is more distorted, which could be due to the specific binding mode of
our inhibitor. The purified T315I Abl kinase domain used for
crystallization experiments is predominantly phosphorylated on the
activation loop at Tyr393, whereas Tyr253, Tyr257, and Tyr264 are
phosphorylated at lower levels. However, in the crystal structure,
only phosphorylation in position Tyr393 can clearly be seen. The
phosphoryl moiety of Tyr393 is situated in a basic pocket formed by
the side chains of Arg362, Arg386, His396, and Lys285 and forms a salt
bridge with Arg386. These interactions probably stabilize the active
conformation of the activation loop, which is, however, very similar
to the structures reported for dasatinib in complex with the WT Abl
kinase domain (19) and of MK-0457 in complex with the Abl mutant
H396P (10).
The inhibitor and the mutated gatekeeper residue Ile315 are well
defined in the electron density maps. The mutation of the
threonine to the more bulky isoleucine does not seem to cause
any widespread conformational changes but creates a steric
hindrance that would interfere with the binding of inhibitors, such
as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which make use of the

hydrophobic pocket. The binding mode of PHA-739358 is very
similar to that reported for the complex of the same compound
with Aurora A (Fig. 2B and D; ref. 16), although the conformation of
the proteins around the ATP-binding site shows some differences
because in the Aurora A structure the DFG motif is more similar to
the ‘‘out’’ conformation. However, all of the essential contacts
between PHA-739358 and Abl T315I involve highly conserved
elements. The molecule makes three hydrogen bonds with the
protein backbone of the hinge region: the two nitrogen atoms of
the pyrrolopyrazole core interact with the carbonyl oxygen of
Glu316 and with the amide nitrogen of Met318, whereas the nitrogen
of the amide group hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of
Met318. In addition, the side chain nitrogen of the conserved Lys271
is within hydrogen bonding distance of the oxygen of the carbonyl
group and the oxygen of the methoxy group. As in the Aurora
structure, the benzyl group packs against Leu370 (Leu263 in Aurora),
whereas the N-methyl-piperazine points toward the solvent
accessible area of the kinase pocket. The gatekeeper residue in
the Aurora kinases is Leu210, a large and hydrophobic residue very
similar to isoleucine, and we have observed that PHA-739358 binds
in the ATP-binding pocket of Aurora A without any steric
hindrance with the gatekeeper residue. Indeed, the cocrystal
structure reported here reveals that the compound is bound to
the Abl T315I kinase domain in a mode that accommodates the
substitution of isoleucine for threonine. Figure 3 shows the
structure of the Abl T315I complex with PHA-739358 superimposed
on those of the Abl WT with imatinib and Abl H396P with MK0457. In the T315I mutant, the isoleucine side chain causes a steric
clash with imatinib and the hydrogen bond between imatinib and

with van der Waals spheres. In the T315I mutant, the isoleucine side chain causes a steric clash with imatinib; in addition, the hydrogen bond between imatinib

the side chain oxygen of threonine is lost (Fig. 3A and B). On the
contrary, both PHA-739358 and MK-0457 bind in such a way to
avoid the gatekeeper residue (Fig. 3C) and this provides an
explanation for the ability of both compounds to accommodate
the isoleucine substitution. Furthermore, the pyrrolopyrazole
scaffold of PHA-739358 is situated within van der Waals distance
of the side chain of Ile315 mimicking the interaction between the
inhibitor and Leu210 in Aurora A. It is possible that this favorable
hydrophobic packing interaction may explain why PHA-739358 is
more active against the mutant than the WT protein. Our results
