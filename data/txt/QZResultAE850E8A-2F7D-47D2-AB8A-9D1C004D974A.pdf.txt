BACKGROUND. In 1981, the authors developed an original strategy combining 3
cycles of doxorubicin (adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
(ABVD) or ABVD-like chemotherapy and extended high-dose radiation for treating patients with clinical stages IIIB and IV Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In the current study, the authors analyzed the 20-year results of this treatment as applied
to 213 patients according to 2 successive trials.

METHODS. All patients who responded to chemotherapy received extended highdose radiation. The rates of complete remission (CR), freedom from disease progression (FFP), HL-specific survival (HLSS), second tumors and cardiac events,
freedom from treatment-associated mortality (FFTM), overall survival (OS), and
event-free survival were calculated.
RESULTS. In December 2006, the median follow-up of the surviving patients

6 years) and HLSS (81.6%, stable after 12 years) were found to be significantly
higher in patients who achieved a CR after chemotherapy. The incidence of hematologic malignancies was 10.9% (with 10 of 12 events occurring within the first
7 years). The rates of solid tumors (32.4%), cardiac events (33.4%), and FFTM
(65.6%) did not reach any plateau by 20 years and were found to be significantly
associated with patient age. The 20-year OS rate was 48%.

CONCLUSIONS. This combined modality treatment gave long-term results similar to
those obtained using 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD. Response to the initial brief chemother-

20-Year Results of CMT in Advanced HL/Senecal et al.

T

he introduction by DeVita in 1964 of the MOPP
regimen (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) was a revolution for patients
with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) at clinical stages (CS)
IIIB and IV, which until that time was considered to
be virtually incurable.1 For these patients, 6 to 8
cycles of the MOPP regimen were shown to have
complete remission (CR) rates peaking at 60% to
80%, with subsequent rates of disease recurrence not
exceeding 50% and the 10-year survival rate finally
reaching 54%.2 Moreover, it was shown that the majority of the patients who failed to enter into CR or
developed disease recurrence did so mainly because
of the persistence or reappearance of the disease at
initial lymph node sites (and, much more rarely, at
visceral sites).3,4 At that time, we believed that such a
progression pattern opened up the possibility of considering the benefit of high-dose lymph node consolidation radiotherapy. However, because radiotherapy
was expected to be poorly tolerated after 6 to 8
cycles of chemotherapy, we decided to test the efficacy of 3 MOPP cycles followed by full-dose (sub)total lymph node radiotherapy in a small series of
patients with CS IIIB and IV HL.5 Because by the end
of the 1970s the combination of doxorubicin (adriamycin; at a dose of 25 mg/m2 intravenously [iv]),
bleomycin (at a dose of 10 mg/m2 iv), vinblastine (at
a dose of 6 mg/m2 iv), and dacarbazine (at a dose of
375 mg/m2 iv) on Days 1 and 15 (ABVD)6 was suggested to be virtually more effective and less toxic7–11
than the MOPP regimen, we decided that our H81-34
trial (October 1981-December 1988) would start with
the administration of 3 cycles of ABVD followed by
extended high-dose radiotherapy. We retained the
same strategy in our randomized H90 clinical trials
(January 1990-December 1996).The 10-year results of
each of these protocols have been published previously.12,13 In the current study, we present the 20year results of this treatment applied to the 213
patients with CS IIIB and IV HL who were included
in the above-mentioned trials. The goals of the current study were to evaluate the predictive value of
the response to the brief initial administration of
chemotherapy on the freedom from disease recurrence and HL-specific survival (HLSS), as well as the
long-term treatment complications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Staging and Treatments
From September 1981 to December 1996, 955
patients ages 18 to 65 years with CS IA to IVB HL
were recruited from the 14 French centers affiliated
mies et
with the Groupe Ouest-Est d’Etude des Leuce

847

Autres Maladies du Sang (GOELAMS) and were enrolled in the H81-34 and H90 trials. All patients were
clinically staged according to the Ann Arbor criteria.14 Patients in the H90 trial were also classified as
having bulky or nonbulky disease13; patients with
bulky disease were those with CS IV HL and those
with CS I to III disease with a mediastinal-to-mass
ratio (MMR) 0.45 and/or an infradiaphragmatic disease involving the lumboaortic and pelvic lymph
nodes; patients without bulky disease had CS I to III,
with a MMR <0.45 and no concomitant involvement
of lumboaortic and pelvic lymph nodes. All patients
were also classified according to the International
Prognostic Score (IPS)15 and the Prognostic Staging
System (PSS).16
The 213 patients with CS IIIB and IV HL were
included in the current study. Of these, 88 belonged
to the H81-34 trial (which also included 45 patients
with CS IIIA HL); they received 3 cycles of ABVD.
The 125 other patients belonged to the H90 trial. The
20 patients with nonbulky CS IIIB disease were randomized according to the H90-NB trial (which also
included 366 patients with nonbulky CS IA to IIIA
disease); these patients received 3 cycles of either
ABVD (10 patients) or EBVM (epirubicin at a dose of
30mg/m2 iv, bleomycin at a dose of 10mg/m2 iv, vinblastine at a dose of 6mg/m2 iv, and methotrexate at
a dose of 30 mg/m2 iv on Days 1 and 15) (10
patients). Conversely, the 105 patients with bulky CS
IIIB and CS IV HL were treated according to the
H90-B trial (which also included 57 patients with CS
IA to IIIA HL); they received a 7-drug chemotherapy
regimen delivered at the same cumulative dose over
3 months either in 3 courses (arm Y, 46 patients) or
4 courses (arm Z, 59 patients). At each course,
patients received epirubicin (80 mg/m2 iv in Arm Y
and 60 mg/m2 iv in Arm Z), bleomycin (20 mg/m2 iv
in Arm Y and 15 mg/m2 iv in Arm Z), vinblastine (6.6
mg/m2 iv in Arm Y and 4 mg/m2 iv in Arm Z), vincristine (1.3 mg/m2 iv in Arm Y and 1 mg/m2 iv in
Arm Z), cyclophosphamide (1300 mg/m2 iv in Arm Y
and 1000 mg/m2 iv in Arm Z), etoposide (300 mg/m2
iv in Arm Y and 225 mg/m2 iv in Arm Z), and methotrexate (60 mg/m2 iv in Arm Y and 45 mg/m2 iv in
Arm Z).
Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after the completion
of chemotherapy, patients were re-evaluated. CR was
defined as the disappearance of all clinical, radiologic, and biologic signs of disease. Partial remission
(PR) was defined as a decrease in lymph node lesions
of 50%, accompanied in CS IV disease by the complete disappearance of visceral lesions. Failure was
the persistence of visceral lesions (regardless of
lymph nodes status) or, in the case of visceral CR,

848

the persistence (<50% decrease) of lymph node disease. Patients with a CR or PR received radiotherapy
whereas those who failed chemotherapy received salvage therapies.
Radiotherapy (10 grays [Gy]/week, for a total of
40 Gy to involved lymph nodes, and 30 Gy to adjacent noninvolved lymph nodes) was initiated 4 to 5
weeks after the last infusion of chemotherapy. Supradiaphragmatic radiation was a mantle adapted to the
site of disease presentation. The extent of infradiaphragmatic radiation administered depended on the
extent of disease. The spleen was irradiated regardless of whether it was involved (40 Gy) or not
(30 Gy).
During the period between 1981 and 1988 (H81
trial), CS IV-associated visceral sites were also irradiated; the lung(s) received 18 Gy (5 Gy/week, using
a half-attenuation block) concurrently with supradiaphragmatic radiation. The liver received 20 Gy
during infradiaphragmatic radiation. Other initially
involved visceral sites received 18 to 30 Gy according
to local tolerance. During the period between 1990
and 1996 (H90 trial), the visceral sites were no longer
irradiated.

Post-treatment Evaluation and Follow-up
The status of the patients was checked 4 to 6 weeks
after the completion of radiotherapy. CR was defined
as the complete disappearance of clinical, radiologic,
and histologic (bone marrow) signs of HL. Patients
with a residual lymph node mass after radiotherapy
(regardless of whether it had remained stable or had
decreased with radiotherapy) were considered to be
in CR, provided the tumor had not regrown by 6
weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
Failure was defined as the reappearance of
lymph node disease and/or the persistence or reappearance of visceral disease during radiotherapy or
within the 6 weeks after its completion.
Remission status was checked every 3 months
during the first year, and then twice a year until the
5th year, once a year until the 10th year, and every
15 to 18 months thereafter. All cases of disease recurrence were carefully identified and treated with various chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens
whenever possible. All treatment complications were
recorded as well as all causes of death.
Statistical Methods
The chi-square test or, when appropriate, the Fisher
exact test (2-tailed) were used to compare qualitative
data. The rates of freedom from disease progression
(FFP), HLSS, freedom from treatment-related mortality (FFTM), overall survival (OS), and event-free sur-

vival (EFS) were calculated from the starting date of
chemotherapy as well as the incidence of secondary
malignancies, that of secondary solid tumors, and
that of cardiovascular complications. Observations
were censored at the stop date of December 31,
2006.
To compute the incidence of FFP, events were
failure to initial treatment or disease recurrence.
Events used to calculate the HLSS rate were deaths
with HL progression (although patients who died
from the immediate toxicity of treatment or while in
CR were censored at the date of these events). Conversely, to calculate FFTM rates, the events used
were deaths resulting from the immediate toxicity of
treatment and all those that occurred in CR
(although deaths resulting from HL progression were
censored). To calculate EFS, both HL progression at
any time and deaths resulting from the immediate
toxicity of treatment and all those that occurred in
CR were taken into account. To calculate OS rates,
all deaths were taken into account.
Curves were computed according to the KaplanMeier method, and compared using the log-rank test.
HLSS and FFTM were considered to be competing
risks and specific survival curves were computed and
compared according to the Gray method.17 This
approach allowed an additive decomposition of mortality (ie, at any given time, 1-OS 5 (1-HLSS) 1 (1FFTM)).

RESULTS
The presenting characteristics of the 213 patients
included in the current study are shown in Table 1. A
total of 102 patients (48%) achieved a CR at the completion of chemotherapy; all remained in CR after
radiotherapy. Conversely, 85 patients were in PR after
chemotherapy, 76 of whom achieved CR after radiotherapy whereas the 9 remaining patients developed
disease progression while receiving or quickly after
radiotherapy. Finally, 23 patients failed to respond to
chemotherapy and 3 patients died during chemotherapy of febrile neutropenia.
Among the 32 patients who failed initial treatment (23 with chemotherapy and 9 with radiotherapy), salvage therapies allowed 15 to obtain a
sustained CR (of whom 1 patient died) whereas the
remaining 17 patients ultimately died of HL.
Among the 178 patients who achieved a CR at
the completion of treatment (84%), 45 developed disease recurrence, 34 (75%) at the initially involved
lymph nodes (12 of whom also had affected visceral
organs). Despite retreatment, 22 patients developed
disease recurrence and died of HL whereas the

remaining 23 patients entered in sustained CR (of
whom 6 patients died) (Table 1).
The 20-year FFP rate of all patients was
61.0  3.6%, a rate that remained nearly stable from
the 6th year onward, without any differences between
those patients treated according to the H81-34 trial
and treated according to the H90 trial, and between
patients aged <40 years and those treated after age
40 years. No difference was observed between patients
with CS IIIB and CS IV HL either. In contrast, significant differences were observed between the 2 IPS
groups: the 20-year FFP rate was 74.2  9.4% in the

low-risk group (86 patients), whereas in the high-risk
group (126 patients), it was 50.8  9.6% (P 5 .001).
Significant differences were also noted between the 3
PSS subsets: early stage (6 patients): 100%; intermediate stage (121 patients): 65.3  8.8%; and advanced
stage (86 patients): 59.0  12.3% (P 5 .04).Conversely,
the FFP rate was found to be significantly higher
in patients who achieved a CR after chemotherapy
(73.8  5.0%) compared with those who did not
(48.8  4.9%) (P < .0001) (Fig. 1A).
A total of 39 patients died of HL. This corresponds to a 20-year HLSS rate of 81.6  2.7%, with-

ter chemotherapy (87.1  3.4%) compared with those
who did not (76.6  4.0%) (P 5 .03) (Fig. 1B).

Fatal Complications of Treatment
Five patients died of febrile cytopenia, 3 within the
days after chemotherapy and 2 within the 3 months
after the completion of radiotherapy. Moreover, 5
patients died of radiation pneumonitis within the 9
months after the completion of radiotherapy, 4 of
whom received radiation to their lung(s) (H81 trial);
another patient who received radiation to the lung
(H81 trial) and had received 2 treatments died of
progressive lung fibrosis while in second CR, 158
months after the beginning of treatment. Finally, 2
patients died after 36 months and 56 months,
respectively, of CR; the first patient died of inappropriate surgical management of a left costodiaphragmatic pachypleuritis (resulting from splenic
radiotherapy) and the second patient died of an intestinal obstruction (resulting from infradiaphragmatic radiation).

out any significant difference noted between patients
treated according the H81-34 trail and those treated
according to the H90 trial and between patients treated before age 40 years and those treated after this
age. Moreover, no difference was observed between
patients with CS IIIB HL and those with CS IV disease, whereas significant differences were observed
between IPS groups (low-risk: 90.8  6.1% and highrisk: 75.2  7.6% [P < .005]), as well as between PSS
subsets (early stage: 100%; intermediate stage:
86.8  6.1%; and advanced stage: 72.9  9.6%
[P 5 .024]). Finally, the HLSS rate was found to be
significantly higher in patients who achieved a CR af-

Secondary Hematologic Malignancies
Seven patients acquired a non-HL (NHL), 4 had an
acute myeloid leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome, and the remaining patient was diagnosed
with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Ten second
hematologic malignancies developed within the first
7 years whereas 1 case of NHL and 1 case of acute
myeloid leukemia appeared >15 years after the onset
of HL treatment. The 20-year second hematologic
malignancy incidence therefore was 10.9  3.9% (Fig.
2A). Among these 12 patients, 4 had received 2 treatments (1 because he failed to respond to initial
chemotherapy and the other 3 patients because they
had developed disease recurrence) and 9 patients
eventually died.
Secondary Solid Tumors
A total of 26 patients developed a solid tumor,
including 6 cancers of the lung, 4 cancers of the
breast, 3 melanomas, 2 cancers of the stomach, 2
cancers of the rectum, 2 cancers of the larynx, 1 cancer of the spinal cord, 1 cancer of the tongue, 1 cancer of the thyroid, 1 cancer of the bladder, 1 cancer
of the gut, 1 cancer of the pancreas, and 1 epidermoid cancer of a finger. Overall, the 20-year incidence of solid tumors was 32.4  6.4%. It was
30.0  7.9% in patients aged <40 years at the time of
HL diagnosis and 37.7  10.8%, in patients
aged >40 years (P 5 .05) (Fig. 2B).
Among these 26 cancer patients, 6 had received
2 treatments (3 because they had failed initial treatment and 3 because they had developed disease re-

currence). Conversely, 19 cancers developed in the
radiation field or at the margins of the radiation field
whereas the 7 other tumors developed outside the
radiation fields. At the time of last follow-up, 15
patients had died of the evolution of their tumor and
1 had committed suicide.

Cardiovascular Events
A total of 27 patients developed a cardiovascular
event: sudden death in 2 patients, myocardial infarction in 14 patients (resulting in 5 deaths), angina
pectoris in 6 patients, constrictive pericarditis in 1
patient (the patient died), cardiomyopathy in 2
patients, stenosis of the carotid artery in 1 patient,
and arrhythmia in 1 patient. Eight of these patients
had received 2 treatments (1 because he had failed
the initial treatment, and the other 7 patients
because they had developed disease recurrence). The
20-year incidence of cardiac events was thus
33.4  6.7%. It was 24.5  6.5% in patients aged <40
years at the time of HL diagnosis and 52.2  14.3%
in patients aged >40 years at diagnosis (P 5 .01)
(Fig. 2C).
Other Fatal Events
Eight other patients died, all of them in first CR. Two
patients had a cerebral ischemic attack, 3 patients
committed suicide (1 after having acquired a solid
tumor), and 1 patient died of a multifocal leukoencephalitis; the cause of 2 deaths remained unknown at
the time of last follow-up.

FIGURE 2. (A) Incidence of secondary hematologic malignancies. (B) Incidence of solid tumors. (C) Incidence of cardiac events. Solid line indicates
all patients (n 5 213); dashed line, age < 40: patients treated before age
40 years (n 5 133); dotted line, age 40: patients treated after age 40
years (n 5 80).

FFTM Rates
A total of 3 patients died of acute complications of
chemotherapy, 10 of well-identified complications of
radiotherapy, 9 of a secondary hematologic malignancy, 15 of a solid tumor, 8 of a cardiac event, and
8 other patients died of other causes. Overall, this
corresponds to a 20-year FFTM rate of 65.6  4.6%.
This incidence was strongly dependant on the age of
the patients at the time they received treatment of
HL (it was 75.4  5.4% when treatment occurred
before age 40 years and 50.0  7.7% after this age
[P < .0001]) (Fig. 3A). No difference was observed
between patients treated according to the H81-34
trial and the H90 trial and between those with CS
IIIB and CS IV disease. In contrast, significant differences were observed between IPS groups (low-risk:
71.8  15.1% and high-risk: 61.2  11.4% [P 5 .03]),
as well as between PSS subsets (early stage: 100%; intermediate stage: 74.2  10.2%; and advanced stage:
52.6  14.9% [P 5 .04]).

OS Rates
A total of 92 patients died within the 20 years after
HL diagnosis, 39 of HL and 53 of treatment-associated events (7 of them after having received 2 treatments) (Table 1). The 20-year OS rate of the entire
group was therefore 47.2  4.7%. No difference was
observed between patients treated according to the
H81-34 trial and the H90 trial and between patients
with CS IIIB and CS IV disease. However, the OS
rate of patients treated before age 40 years was
much higher than that of those treated after this
age (58.7  5.7% vs 28.7  7.0%; P < .0001) (Fig. 3B).
Significant differences also were observed between
IPS groups (low-risk: 62.5  15.3% and high-risk:
36.4  11.0%; P < .0001), as well as between PSS
subsets (early stage: 100%; intermediate stage:
60.9  10.8%; and advanced stage: 25.5  18.3%
[P < .0001]).
EFS Rates
A total of 77 patients developed disease progression
during or after treatment; 3 patients died of the immediate toxicity of the chemotherapy and 43 died in
first CR. The 20-year EFS rate of the entire group was
therefore 33.7  8.4%. No difference was observed
between patients treated according to the H81-34
trial and the H90 trial (P 5 .69), between patients
treated before age 40 years and those treated after
this age (P 5 .08), and between patients with CS IIIB
disease and those with CS IV disease. In contrast,
significant differences were observed between IPS
groups (low-risk: 46.8  15.8% and high-risk: 24.5 
9.4%; P < .0001), as well as between PSS subsets
(early stage: 100%; intermediate stage: 43.8  10.6%;
and advanced stage: 16.6  11.2% [P < .001]). Finally,
the EFS rate was found to be significantly higher in
patients who achieved a CR after chemotherapy
(40.2  12.4%) compared with those who did not
(28.1  11.3%) (P < .01) (Fig. 3C).

Until recently, the reference therapy of HL at
advanced stages consisted of 6 to 8 cycles of
ABVD.18–21 This treatment resulted in CR rates of
approximately 80% and 15-year survival rates reaching 60%.19 It is important to note that, in patients
with a CR after 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy was finally demonstrated to be
equivalent to adjuvant radiotherapy (Table 2).22–24
The findings of the current study bring to light
the very long-term results of an original strategy
combining an abridged chemotherapy (3 months
of ABVD or ABVD-like chemotherapy) followed in

responding patients by extended high-dose radiotherapy. This strategy was applied to 213 patients with
CS IIIB and IV HL. In December 2006, the median
follow-up of surviving patients exceeded 13 years.
The CR rate observed after chemotherapy was
48% but reached 84% after the completion of radiotherapy (Table 1), a rate similar to that observed after
6 to 8 courses of ABVD or similar regimens (Table
2).18–20,22–27 Patients who achieved a CR after 3
months of chemotherapy retained a relatively high
rate of disease recurrence (26.2%), the majority of
which developed in lymph node areas despite adjuvant full-dose radiation. This indicates that stage IV
visceral disease can be eradicated in a high proportion of patients by only 3 cycles of ABVD. It also suggests that the intensity of initial chemotherapy is an
important treatment parameter with which to
increase the FFP rate, as has been recently shown.28
Moreover, the finding that the remission status
observed at the completion of 3 chemotherapy cycles
was predictive of the FFP rate is in keeping with
positron emission tomography (PET) scan results
performed after 2 or 3 chemotherapy courses.29,30
The 20-year FFP rate remained >60% and was nearly

stable from the 6th year after the onset of treatment
onward (Fig. 1A); as a consequence, the HLSS rate
was also very high (81.6%) and was stable from the
12th year onward after the initial date of treatment
(Fig. 1B).
However, an important negative aspect of this
strategy was the high incidence of secondary tumors
and cardiac complications. A total of 12 patients in
the current series acquired a secondary hematologic
tumor, 10 of which developed within the 10 years after the onset of HL therapy, a delay already known
for secondary leukemias.12,31 However, the use of
ABVD chemotherapy alone as well as radiotherapy
alone was known to result in very low incidences of
secondary hematologic malignancies.7,10,32 It is now
obvious that when dacarbazine (the alkylating agent
included in the ABVD association) or cyclophosphamide (the alkylating agent included in our 7-drug
chemotherapy) is combined with extended high-dose
radiotherapy, the incidence of secondary hematologic
malignancies is much higher, as shown by the results
of the current study. The negative role of the combination of alkylating agents and extended high-dose
radiation was demonstrated by the overall results of

854

the randomized H90-NB trial, which included 386
patients33; the 200 patients who had received a combination of ABVD and extended high-dose radiotherapy had a 10-year probability of developing a
hematologic malignancy of 4.5%, an incidence that is
significantly higher than that observed in the 186
patients in the other treatment arm who had
received EBVM (a chemotherapy regimen that does
not contain an alkylating agent) combined with the
same radiotherapy regimen (0.6%) (P 5 .04).
In contrast to the incidence of hematologic
malignancies, which only slightly increased in the
second decade after treatment, the incidence of solid
tumors and cardiac events continued to increase
without any plateau being reached after the 10th
year of follow-up. Both types of events have now
been definitely associated with high-dose radiation,
such as that performed in this group of patients. In
addition to the risk of cardiac complications resulting
from the cumulated dose of anthracyclines,34 the
incidence of cardiac events has been correlated with
the dose received to the mediastinum35,36 and the
incidence of solid tumors with the dose and extension of the radiation.37 Taken together, the FFTM
rate of the current series of patients decreased progressively (without any plateau reached) to attain a
rate of 65.4% by 20 years. The final result is that, by
15 years after the diagnosis of HL, the OS rate
reached 57.2%, a rate similar to the rate of 60%
observed after 6 to 8 cycles of ABVD (Table 2)17, and
was nearly 50% by 20 years.
The careful analysis resulting from the long-term
follow-up of the current series of patients combined
with the recent data observed in the literature28–30
allowed us to prepare our H2008 trials for patients with
advanced stage HL. The challenge was to find a treatment package that would give the highest rate of FFP
and at the same time the highest incidence of FFTM
(ie, the lowest rates of early [toxic deaths], intermediate
[hematologic tumors], and late [solid tumors and cardiac events] treatment complications). Our next trial
will be designed to test the usefulness of an intensive
and brief chemotherapy regimen that includes the
minimum number of alkylating agents (to avoid second hematologic malignancies). A PET scan evaluation
will then identify those patients who achieve a CR and
who will receive adjuvant chemotherapy (allowing
them to avoid any radiotherapy); patients who still
retain hypermetabolic spots indicative of persistent HL
will be given intensive second-line chemotherapy, possibly followed by focal radiation.
It is important to note that, because these intensive chemotherapies are potentially harmful, they
will be given only to the group of patients with the

worst prognosis; this high-risk group will be identified by the PSS, which was shown in a series of 955
patients with CS IA to IVB disease (all of whom had
received a brief anthrcycline-based chemotherapy
regimen followed by extended high-dose radiotherapy) to be more discriminating and predictive than
the Ann Arbor staging system.16
