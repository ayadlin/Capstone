BACKGROUND. For the current study, the authors sought to determine whether
administration

of

multiple-dose

granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating

factor (GM-CSF) could improve response to standard 23-valent polysaccharide
pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL).

METHODS. Patients were allocated randomly to receive PPV either alone or with 3
doses of GM-CSF (250 lg) given before or after vaccination. Serum was obtained
before, 4 weeks after, and 12 weeks after vaccination for antibody determination.
Thirty-two patients with CLL were given PPV. They were randomized to receive 3
doses of GM-CSF either before or after vaccination or to receive no GM-CSF.

RESULTS. A 4-fold rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) to capsular polysaccharides

from Streptococcus pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 19F, and 23F occurred in
<10% of patients in each of the 3 groups. There were no differences in geometric
mean IgG levels in any of the 3 groups 4 weeks or 12 weeks after vaccination.

CONCLUSIONS. In patients with CLL, the response to pure polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine was low despite immune enhancement with multiple doses
of GM-CSF. In all patients, reactogenicity was minor. Cancer 2008;113:383–7.

severe and recurrent pneumococcal infections. Several preventive strategies have been used, including
1) vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2)
intravenous Ig therapy,3 and/or 3) prolonged prophylaxis with systemic antimicrobial agents. Antibody
responses to standard pneumococcal vaccine are
inadequate in most patients with B-cell cancers.4
Furthermore, a population-based efficacy analysis
of 23-valent capsular polysaccharide pneumococcal
vaccine (PPV) in an at-risk population was marginally effective in preventing pneumococcal bacteremia.5
Granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) enhances multifaceted immune responses,
including dendritic cell (DC)-mediated antigen presentation, and has been an attractive vaccine adjuvant.6 In patients with CLL, it is believed that
abnormal cytokine profiles interfere with otherwise
normal DC functions.7,8 Adjuvant treatment with
GM-CSF may enhance vaccine response in patients
with CLL by promoting DC functions and/or normalizing B-cell responses.9 The objective of the current
study was to determine whether administration of
multiple-dose GM-CSF could improve response to
pneumococcal vaccine in patients with CLL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)
(Houston, Tex). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. Patients were recruited
from the adult CLL clinic at the MDACC between

January 12, 2005 and July 12, 2006. They were allocated randomly to receive standard 23-valent PPV
alone or with 3 doses of GM-CSF given before or
after vaccination (Figure 1). The vaccine and GMCSF were dispensed by the MDACC research pharmacy. Serum was obtained before, 4 weeks after, and
12 weeks after vaccination for antibody determination. Patients’ identifiable information was secured by
creating a code, and all identifiers were secured at
MDACC.
Patients were eligible if they had biopsy-proven
CLL according to standard diagnostic criteria.10
Patients were excluded if they had received fludarabine or alemtuzumab (monoclonal antibody that
binds to CD52 and triggers antibody-dependent cell
lyses) in the previous 12 months. In addition,
patients who had received rituximab or parenteral Ig
within 6 months were not included. Patients were
ineligible if they were allergic to GM-CSF or PPV, if
they had undergone splenectomy, if they had
received systemic adrenal corticosteroids, or if they
had been on other investigational vaccines or antineoplastic medications in the 2 weeks before enrollment. Because of eligibility criteria and the inconvenience
of repeated visits, only 37 patients agreed to participate
during the enrollment period.

Vaccine
PPV (Pneumovax; Merck & Company) was a commercially available pneumococcal vaccine from a
single lot that contained purified capsular polysaccharides of 23 pneumococcal serotypes. Each dose

GM-CSF Plus Pneumococcal Vaccine in CLL/Safdar et al.

contained 25 lg of each capsular polysaccharide and
was administered as a single, 0.5-mL, intramuscular
injection into the nondominant deltoid muscle.

GM-CSF
Sargramostim (Leukine; Berlex, Seattle, Wash) is a
recombinant human GM-CSF that is produced by
recombinant DNA technology in a Saccharomyces
cerevisiae expression system. The recombinant product is a glycoprotein of 127 amino acids characterized by 3 primary molecular species, which have
molecular masses of 19,500 days, 16,800 days, and
15,500 days. The amino-acid sequence of recombinant product differs from the natural human GMCSF by a substitution of leucine at position 23, and
the carbohydrate moiety may be different from the
native protein. The biologic potency, as tested
against the World Health Organization First International Reference Standard, is approximately 5.6 3 106
IU/mg, and the dose used in this study was 250 lg.
Vaccine Response
Response to PPV was determined by measuring serum IgG to capsular polysaccharides from 6 of the
most common infecting serotypes of S. pneumoniae
using methods previously described from this laboratory5; the results are reported in lg/mL. An individual was regarded as having responded if there was
a 2-fold rise in anticapsular IgG when the prevaccination titer was compared with levels either 4 weeks
or 12 weeks postvaccination (whichever was higher)
and with a final level >0.5 lg/mL. Geometric mean
titers for each vaccine-dose group were calculated,
and statistical comparisons were made using the
Student t test. The rationale for the sample size
was as follows: A sample size of 16 patients would
have achieved 94% power to detect a difference of
50 between the null hypothesis mean of 250 and
the alternative hypothesis mean of 200 with an estimated standard deviation of 60 and a 1-sided significance level of 5%. Therefore, 16 patients should have
been sufficient to detect an inefficacious immune
response.
Adverse Events
A diary card was provided to patients for self-documentation of adverse reactions that included soreness, tenderness, erythema, or swelling at the vaccination
site; malaise, myalgia, feeling feverish, and actual
fever were also recorded. Safety follow-up visits were
at 7 days to 10 days, 28  4 days, and 56  4 days
after receiving vaccination.

Prior antineoplastic therapy had consisted of
fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, plus rituximab (murine/
human monoclonal antibody with high affinity for
CD20-expressing cells) in 14 patients (44%). Nine
patients (28%) had received rituximab alone. One
patient each had received fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide; fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide
and amifostine; clofarabine; fludarabine; and a research plasmid vaccine. Four patients (13%) had not
received antineoplastic therapy.

Vaccine Response
The number of individuals with an increase in IgG to
capsular polysaccharides and the geometric mean
serum antibody titer for each group in relation to
vaccine and GM-CSF status are shown in Table 2. Of
all possible individual responses (6 capsular polysaccharides 3 the number of patients in each group),
only 8 of 78 patients (10.3%), 5 of 60 patients (8.3%)
and 4 of 42 patients (9.5%) were positive in the
GM-CSF then PPV23 group, the PPV23 then GM-CSF
group, and the PPV23 alone group, respectively. One
patient who received GM-CSF before PPV23 had
received weekly rituximab (1085 mg) during 4 weeks
after vaccination. In this patient, no difference in
antipneumococcal IgG titers was noted before or
after vaccination. After excluding this patient from
the final analysis shown in Table 2, the values of
geometric mean titer did not change significantly
(data not shown).
Comparing prevaccine and postvaccine IgG
levels for each individual polysaccharide and within
each group, in no patient was there a statistically significant difference (P >.05 for all comparisons; Student t test). A 2-fold increase in geometric mean IgG

levels was observed for only 1 capsular polysaccharide in each group, and the overall rises in titers were
remarkably similar and equally low (differences were
not significant for all comparisons; P > .05).

Vaccine-related Adverse Events
All patients were followed for 6 months after vaccination, and no serious vaccine-related adverse reactions were noted. Among patients who received GMCSF before vaccination, 1 patient each had pain and
redness at the cytokine injection site, palmer erythema, and a low-grade fever (38 8C) for 1 day.
Whereas, in patients who received GM-CSF after PPV,
5 patients had pain and redness at the injection site,
and 1 patient developed self-limiting cold-like symptoms. In patients who received PPV alone, 1 patient
developed pain and redness at the injection site.

DISCUSSION
In this randomized study of patients with CLL, multiple-dose GM-CSF given before or after PPV was not
associated with enhanced serum antibody responses
to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides compared
with responses in patients who were given PPV alone.
The use of 3 GM-CSF doses before or after PPV was
safe and produced no serious adverse reactions in
any patients.
The use of GM-CSF as a single dose with standard, trivalent influenza vaccine was ineffective in
improving vaccine response in patients with solid
organ cancers or hematologic malignancies, including patients who had received adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 weeks of vaccination.11 However, a
single dose of GM-CSF improved the response to

GM-CSF Plus Pneumococcal Vaccine in CLL/Safdar et al.

influenza vaccine in stem cell transplantation recipients during the early post-transplantation period.12
In our CLL patients, even multiple GM-CSF doses
before or after pneumococcal vaccination did not
improve antibody responses at 4 weeks or 12 weeks
after vaccination (Table 2).
A low immunogenicity of PPV, which predominantly depends on the IgG2-mediated immune
response, may be the reason for the poor performance of PPV in patients with clonal B-cell leukemia
who have selective IgG subclass defects. Other factors also may have played a role because advanced
disease, low gammaglobulin levels, and high soluble
CD23 blood levels were factors associated with unfavorable vaccine response in 25 patients with CLL.13
The results of the current study negate our hypothesis that impaired antibody responses to PPV among
patients with CLL may be improved by administering
multiple doses of GM-CSF.
Various strategies to improve vaccine responses
have yielded inconsistent results in patients with
B-cell malignancies. Recently, we demonstrated a
benefit of a 6-fold higher than standard influenza
vaccine dose given to patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.14 In another study, immune priming
with a peptide-conjugate pneumococcal vaccine
resulted in enhanced antipneumococcal antibody
response to subsequent vaccination with PPV.15 Further studies are needed to determine the value of an
approach that uses 1 or more method(s) to improve
vaccine-response in immunosuppressed patients
with hematologic malignancies. Such studies are
ongoing in patients with CLL.
