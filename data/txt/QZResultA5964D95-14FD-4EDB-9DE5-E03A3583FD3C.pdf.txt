Abstract
The IG20 gene undergoes alternative splicing resulting in the
differential expression of six putative splice variants. Four of
these (IG20pa, MADD, IG20-SV2, and DENN-SV) are expressed
in virtually all human tissues. However, investigations
examining alternative splicing of the IG20 gene to date have
been largely limited to nonneural malignant and nonmalignant cells. In this study, we investigated the expression of
alternative splice isoforms of the IG20 gene in human
neuroblastoma cells. We found that six IG20 splice variants
(IG20-SVs) were expressed in two human neuroblastoma cell
lines (SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y), highlighted by the expression of
two unique splice isoforms (i.e., KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4).
Similarly, we found enriched expression of these two IG20-SVs
in human neural tissues derived from cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, and, to a lesser extent, spinal cord. Using
gain-of-function studies and siRNA technology, we determined
that these ‘‘neural-enriched isoforms’’ exerted significant and
contrasting effects on vulnerability to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Specifically, expression of KIAA0358 exerted a
potent antiapoptotic effect in both the SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cell lines, whereas expression of IG20-SV4 had
proapoptotic effects directly related to the activation of
caspase-8 in these cells, which have minimal or absent
constitutive caspase-8 expression. These data indicate that
the pattern of expression of these neural-enriched IG20-SVs
regulates the expression and activation of caspase-8 in certain
neuroblastoma cells, and that manipulation of IG20-SV
expression pattern may represent a potent therapeutic
strategy in the therapy of neuroblastoma and perhaps other
cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7352–61]

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is one of the most frequently occurring solid
tumors in children, particularly in the first year of life, when it
accounts for 50% of all tumors (1). Although improvement in
outcome has been observed in small, well-defined subsets of
patients over the past several years, the outcome for patients with a
high-risk clinical phenotype has not improved, with long-term
survival <40% (2). A characteristic feature of neuroblastoma is its
remarkable clinical and biological heterogeneity (3). Whereas

advanced stage neuroblastoma in older children typically responds
poorly to aggressive chemotherapy regimens, certain tumors in
patients below 1 year of age may spontaneously regress or
differentiate into benign ganglioneuromas (2, 3). This spontaneous
regression likely represents the activation of an apoptotic and/or
differentiation pathway, and the prognosis in neuroblastoma
patients may be related to the level of expression of molecules
involved in the regulation of apoptosis.
The IG20 (insulinoma-glucagonoma) gene has been implicated
in cancer cell survival and apoptosis (4–10), neurotransmission
(11, 12), and neurodegeneration (13). We have previously shown
that various splice isoforms of the IG20 gene (IG20-SVs), including
IG20pa, MADD/DENN, and DENN-SV, act as negative or positive
regulators of apoptosis, and their levels of expression can
profoundly affect cell survival in nonneural cells (6–10). IG20-SVs
are believed to act, in part, by modulating inflammatory and
apoptotic signaling pathways, effects mediated through interactions with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). TNFa
interacts with TNFR1 to trigger proinflammatory actions through
various stress-activated protein kinases, such as c-Jun NH2terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(14, 15). IG20 interacts strongly with TNFR1, and all putative
IG20-SVs contain the death domain homology region required for
this binding. We have shown that expression of MADD/DENN
is required and sufficient for cancer cell survival in nonneuronal
cancer cells and mediates its effects by acting as a negative
regulator of caspase-8 activation (16). Overexpression of IG20pa, on
the other hand, results in enhanced apoptosis and activation of
caspase-8 through enhanced death-inducing signaling complex
formation (9). The caspase-8 (CASP8) gene encodes a key enzyme
at the top of the apoptotic cascade. In neuroblastoma cell lines and
tumor samples, CgG methylation of CASP8 at the 5¶ end has been
associated with inactivation of the gene (17), and recent
hypotheses have proposed that CASP8 may act as a neuroblastoma
tumor suppressor gene (17–20). Furthermore, neuroblastoma cell
lines that do not express caspase-8 are resistant to TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand–induced apoptosis (19), and suppression
of caspase-8 expression has been shown to occur during
establishment of neuroblastoma metastases in vivo (21).
In this study, we show the preferential expression of two unique
splice isoforms (KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4) of the IG20 gene in
selected nervous system tissues and in two neuroblastoma cell
lines known to be deficient in the expression of caspase-8.
Through gain-of-function studies and using siRNA technology, we
show that expression of IG20-SV4 enhances cellular apoptosis and
leads to the expression and activation of caspase-8 in SK-N-SH
and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, thereby sensitizing these cells
to the proapoptotic effects of TNFa. In contrast, expression of
KIAA0358 effectively renders cells resistant to apoptosis, even
when IG20-SV4 is coexpressed, and down-modulation of this

isoform causes markedly enhanced apoptotic cell death and
activation of caspase-8.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
cultured according their instructions. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were cultured in
DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate,
1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 units of penicillin/mL, and 100 Ag of
streptomycin/mL. SH-SY5Yand BE(2)-C cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of
Eagle’s MEM with nonessential amino acids and Ham’s F12 medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units of penicillin/mL, and
100 Ag of streptomycin/mL. The cell lines were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified chamber with 5% CO2.
Design of small inhibitory RNAs. The small inhibitory RNAs (siRNA)
used in this study are shown in Table 1. The siRNAs targeting exons 13L,
16E, and 15 (‘‘Mid’’) and SCR (negative control shRNA) are identical to those
previously described (10). The siRNA targeting exon34 was designed using
OligoEngine Workstation 2 and purchased from OligoEngine, Inc. These
siRNAs were screened in SK-N-SH cells and the most efficient were used to
construct the 34E-shRNA lentivirus.
Plasmid construction. The siRNAs were cloned into the pSUPER
vector using BgIII and HindIII sites (22) to generate pSup-34 plasmids.
The shRNA cassettes (including the H1 RNA promoter and the shRNA)
were excised from pSup-34 using XbaI and ClaI sites and ligated into the
pNL-SIN-CMV-GFP vector to generate 34E lentivirus constructs. The
pcTat, pcRev, and pHIT/G plasmids were gifts from Drs. B.R. Cullen
(Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Molecular Genetics
and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and T.J.
Hope (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Feinberg School of
Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The YFP-IG20pa plasmid
(16) was used as a backbone to subclone YFP-KIAA0358 from the
corresponding pBKRSV plasmid (6) using the BstZ171 and BsiWI sites.
The YFP-KIAA0358 and YFPIG20-SV4 Mid-shRNA resistant mutant
constructs were generated using the QuickChange XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, the primers 5¶-CGGAACCACAGTACAAGCTTTAGCCTCTCAAACCTCACACTGCC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGCAGTGTGAGGTTTGAGAGGCTAAAGCTTGTACTGTGGTTCCG-3¶ (reverse) were used to insert four
silent mutations (underlined letters) in the cDNAs without affecting the
amino acid sequence. HindIII restriction sites in the mutants, generated
due to base substitutions, were used to identify positive clones that were
further confirmed by sequencing. The caspase-8 promoter luciferase
vector was constructed by PCR amplification of a 1.2-kb fragment from
pBLCAT-Casp8 vector and cloning into Promega pGL4.17 luciferase vector
at KpnI and XhoI sites. The pBLCAT3 vector containing fragment 1,161/
+16 of the caspase-8 promoter was a gift from Dr. Silvano Ferrini’s lab
(Laboratory of Immunological Therapy, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca
sul Cancro, University of Insubria, Genoa, Italy; ref. 23).
Preparation of lentivirus stocks. Lentivirus stocks were prepared as
described previously (22). Briefly, subconfluent 293FT cells grown in
100-mm plates were cotransfected with 10.8 mg lentivirus vector, 0.6 mg

pcRev, 0.6 mg pcTat, and 0.3 mg pHIT/G using calcium phosphate. Culture
medium was replaced after 16 h, and the supernatant was harvested at
40 h and filtered using a 0.45-mm filter. The optimal viral titer for each cell
type was determined as the least amount of viral supernatant required to
transduce at least 50% of target cells without apparent cytotoxicity.
RNA preparation. Total RNA extracted from human cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, and cerebellum and human thyroid, skeletal muscle, lung,
and liver were purchased from BD Clontech. Total RNA extracted from
primary neuroblastoma was a gift from Dr. Jill Lahti’s lab of St. Jude’s
Children’s Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). For testing the efficiency of
down-modulation of IG20-SVs by different siRNAs, the transduced green
fluorescent protein (GFP)–positive SK-N-SH cells were sorted on the MoFlo
High-Performance Cell Sorter (DAKO Denmark). Total RNA was extracted
from 1  106 GFP-positive neuroblastoma cells and other described cell
lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
Reverse transcription-PCR. We used 1 Ag of RNA for reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR
system (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Briefly, the cDNAs were synthesized at
50jC for 30 min followed by incubation at 94jC for 2 min. Subsequently,
30 cycles of PCR were carried out with denaturation at 94jC for 50 s,
annealing at 55jC for 50 s, and extension at 72jC for variable time periods
(as described below), followed by a final incubation at 72jC for 7 min. For
amplifying exons 13L and 16, F-1 and B-1 primer pairs (5¶-CGGGACTCTGACTCCGAACCTAC-3¶ and 5¶-GCGGTTCAGCTTGCTCAGGAC-3¶, respectively) were used, with 1-min extension time. For amplifying exon 34, F4824
and B5092 primer pairs (5¶-CTGCAGGTGACCCTGGAAGGGATC-3¶ and 5¶TGTACCCGGGTCAGCTAGAGACAGGCC-3¶, respectively) were used, with
30-s extension time as described previously (8). The sequence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has previously been published
(9). The PCR products were then separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel.
Cell proliferation assay. Cell proliferation assays were done according to
the Vybrant 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) cell proliferation assay kit (V-13154, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen)
instructions. Briefly, 24 h posttransduction, 1  104 sorted GFP-positive SK-NSH cells were plated onto 96-well plates. Every other day, cells were washed
with PBS and labeled with 10 AL of 12 mmol/L MTT stock solution in each
well, incubated at 37jC for 4 h, and washed with PBS. Fifty microliters of
DMSO were added to each well and mixed thoroughly with a pipette, and
absorbance was recorded at 540 nm.
CFSE dilution assay. Twenty-four hours posttransduction, 1  105 SKN-SH cells were stained with 2 mmol/L SNARF-1 carboxylic acid, acetate,
succinimidyl ester (S-22801, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37jC.
Cells were washed and either used immediately for FACS analysis or plated
onto six-well plates. Every other day, cells were collected and washed, and
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution, as an
indicator of cell division, was determined in GFP-positive cells by FACS
analysis at excitation/emission of 480/640 nm.
1,1¶,3,3,3¶,3¶-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine iodide staining. SK-NSH cells (1.5  105) were plated onto six-well plates. Twenty-four hours
later, cells were treated with different shRNA-expressing lentiviruses for 4 h,
washed, and replenished with fresh warm medium immediately and every
other day thereafter. At 5 d, the transduced cells were trypsinized with
0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mmol/L EDTA and suspended in 1-mL warm PBS. Then,

The protein content was determined with a dye-binding microassay (BioRad), and after boiling the samples for 2 min in a 1 SDS protein sample
buffer, 20 Ag of protein per lane were loaded and separated on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The proteins were blotted onto Hybond ECL
membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After electroblotting, the membranes
were blocked with TBS with Tween 20 [TBST; 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20] containing 5% milk and were incubated
with antibodies diluted in a 5% BSA-TBST buffer that can detect cleaved
caspase-8 (Santa Cruz, C-20), caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), and full-length
caspase-3 (R&D System, 84803) overnight. The primary antibody dilutions
were those recommended by the manufacturer. The membranes were then
washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5,000) in a
blocking buffer for 1 h, and repeatedly washed. Proteins were detected by
an enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blotting detection system
(Amersham). The anti-GAPDH-horseradish peroxidase (Abcam) antibodies
were used as loading controls.

Results
Expression of IG20-SVs in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines
and Nervous System Tissues
To begin to understand the potential relevance of IG20 alternative
splicing in the control of apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, we first
tested the constitutive expression patterns of IG20-SVs in several
neuroblastoma cell culture lines. We used RNA extracted from the
SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cell
lines and performed RT-PCR using multiple sets of IG20-specific
primers as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 1 shows the
expression pattern of IG20-SVs in the tested tissues and cell lines.
Although only one representative sample for each tissue type
is shown, we used RNAs from multiple samples of each tissue
type to validate the RT-PCR results. In agreement with previous
studies (6, 7, 16), we confirmed that different IG20-SVs are expressed
in different patterns and levels in various human tissues. In addition,
we found that two isoforms, KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4, which are
not significantly expressed in nonneural tissues, are highly expressed
in two (SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y) of the three human neuroblastoma
cell lines tested and in human cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and,
o a lesser extent, spinal cord (Fig. 1). In addition, these two isoforms
were expressed in both caspase-8–expressing (NB5 and NB16)
and caspase-8–deficient (NB8 and NB10) primary neuroblastoma
tumor lines. The levels of expression of KIAA-0358 and IG20-SV4
did not correlate with the constitutive expression of caspase-8 in
these cells.

SiRNAs Effectively Down-Modulate the Expression of
Endogenous IG20-SVs in Neuroblastoma Cells

To analyze the effects of IG20-SVs on neuroblastoma cell survival
and apoptosis, we designed siRNAs to selectively down-modulate
specific IG20-SVs as shown in Fig. 2A. We had previously identified
the most effective siRNAs targeting all isoforms and targeting exons
13L in studies using HeLa cells and PA-1 cells (16, 22, 24). We
similarly screened several siRNAs targeting exon 34 and chose the
most effective for use in this study. We cloned each siRNA in
lentiviral vectors to allow for stable expression of the siRNAs that
could be detected through GFP expression.
The targeted exons and resulting down-modulated IG20 isoforms
for each siRNA used in this study are summarized in Table 1. We
cloned shRNAs into a self-inactivating lentivirus vector (pNL-SINGFP; ref. 25) and generated 13L, Mid-, 34E, and SCR (negative control
shRNA) constructs. Using GFP, this enabled us to monitor the
expression of double-copy cassettes likely resulting in enhanced
silencing (25). The transduction efficiency was >50% as determined
by GFP expression. For testing the down-modulation efficiency, total
RNA from transduced and GFP-positive SK-N-SH cells was used for
RT-PCR. The results are shown in Fig. 2B and D. As expected, SK-NSH cells expressing Mid-shRNA showed decreased expression levels
of all IG20-SVs relative to control (SCR). 13L-shRNA caused downmodulation of IG20pa, MADD, and KIAA0358; 34E-shRNA caused
down-modulation of IG20pa, MADD, IG20-SV2, and DENN-SV; and

34E + 13L shRNA caused down-modulation of all of these IG20-SVs
with the addition of KIAA0358. Interestingly, when all isoforms
except IG20-SV4 were down-modulated, the expression of this sole
isoform seemed to be increased at 5 days posttransduction
(Fig. 2B–D).

Down-Modulation of KIAA0358 in Neuroblastoma
Cells Leads to Spontaneous Apoptosis but Has No
Apparent Effect on Cellular Proliferation
Down-modulation of IG20-SVs has no effect on cellular
proliferation of neuroblastoma cells. To assess the influence of
IG20-SVs on neuroblastoma cell growth and proliferation, various
shRNA-expressing viable cells were counted using a MTT assay and
CFSE dilution. Relative to controls, a significant decrease in the
numbers of viable cells expressing Mid-, 34E, 13L, and 34E + 13L
shRNA was observed (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, there was
no difference in CFSE dilution (SNARF-1 carboxylic acid, acetate,
succinimidyl ester) over time among the SCR control, Mid-, 34, 13L,
and 34 + 13L shRNA–treated cells, suggesting that the differences
in cell numbers were not due to decreased cellular proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Further, shRNA-treated cells failed to
show significant differences in cell cycle progression (data not
shown). Together, these results indicated that manipulation of the
expression patterns of IG20-SVs had little or no effect on cell
proliferation or cell cycle progression.
Down-modulation of KIAA0358 induces apoptosis in
SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Because there is no single
method that can conclusively show cellular apoptosis, we
determined spontaneous cell death using both mitochondrial
membrane potential DiIC staining (Fig. 3A and B) and Annexin
V-PE/ 7-AAD staining (Fig. 3C) to ensure the reliability of our
findings. We observed that down-modulation of all IG20-SVs with
Mid-shRNA resulted in a significant increase in spontaneous
apoptosis. Down-modulation of IG20pa, MADD, and KIAA0358
(by targeting exon 13L) and down-modulation of all isoforms with
the exception of IG20-SV4 (by targeting exons 13L and 34E) also
resulted in significantly increased spontaneous apoptosis. These
results were consistently observed using both methods of
apoptosis determination and after repeating all experiments at
least thrice. This suggested to us that certain IG20-SVs may act as
prosurvival factors because their knockdown resulted in spontaneous apoptosis. The most likely candidates for this prosurvival
function were MADD/DENN and KIAA0358 based on the
proapoptotic results of down-modulation of these two IG20-SVs.
Interestingly, the selective expression of KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4
in the absence of other isoforms (targeting exon 34) resulted in
markedly reduced apoptotosis. This finding strongly indicated
that expression of KIAA0358 had a pronounced antiapoptotic
effect because expression of IG20-SV4 alone (in the absence of all
other isoforms including KIAA0358) resulted in very high levels of
spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 3A–C), which were suppressed by
DN-FADD overexpression (see below).
Enhanced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells depleted of KIAA0358
is due to expression and activation of caspase-8. To identify the
mechanism of enhanced apoptosis induced by IG20-SV downmodulation, we examined whether specific caspases were activated
in transduced SK-N-SH cells. Cells depleted of KIAA0358 (Mid, 13L
and 13L + 34E cells) showed enhanced expression of cleaved
caspase-8. There was accompanying evidence for processing of
caspase-3 (slightly reduced expression of procaspase-3) but no
change in caspase-9 (Fig. 3D).

Manipulation of IG20-SVs in other neuroblastoma cell lines
[SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2)-C]. Similarly, SH-SY5Y cells transduced
with 13L and 13L + 34E siRNAs showed enhanced apoptosis
associated with prominent expression and activation of caspase-8
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Because we determined that SK-N-BE(2)-C
cells did not express KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4, we obviously did not
expect that the siRNAs targeting these isoforms would be relevant in
this cell line. Instead, we overexpressed IG20-SV4 and KIAA0358 in
SK-N-BE(2)-C cells and examined the effect on caspase-8 activation.
Introduction of these isoforms had no effect on the expression/
activation of caspase-8 (Supplementary Fig. S3), which was
expressed at very low baseline levels in these cells, consistent with
previous reports (26, 27).

Treatment with TNFA Enhances Apoptosis in
Neuroblastoma Cells Expressing IG20-SV4 in a FADDDependent Manner but Does Not Attenuate the
Antiapoptotic Effect of KIAA0358
As a binding partner for the TNFR1, the IG20 gene promotes both
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signals in HeLa cells (6, 7). Therefore,
we tested the apoptotic effect of TNFa on SK-N-SH cells. Treatment
with TNFa enhanced apoptosis in cells transduced with shRNAs
targeting the 13L exon and the combination of exons 13L and 34E (Fig.
4A). This induced sensitization to TNFa was significantly suppressed
by DN-FADD overexpression (Fig. 4B). However, cells transduced with
shRNA targeting exon 34 that did not alter endogenous expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4 continued to be resistant to apoptosis even
after TNFa treatment (Fig. 4A).

Overexpression of KIAA0358 Can Rescue SK-N-SH
Cells from Spontaneous Apoptosis Induced by DownModulation of All IG20-SVs by Dampening Caspase-8
Activation
We created silent mutations in cDNAs encoding KIAA0358 at sites
corresponding to the 5th, 7th, 11th, and 14th nucleotides of the MidshRNA target sequence. These mutations affected neither the amino
acid sequence nor the protein expression. We generated SK-N-SH
cells stably expressing YFP-KIAA0358-Mut. We confirmed that the
Mid-shRNA was unable to down-modulate YFP-KIAA0358-Mut but
effectively down-modulated the expression of all endogenous IG20SVs (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, expression of this KIAA0358 mutant was
sufficient to rescue SK-N-SH cells from spontaneous apoptosis
caused by Mid-shRNA transduction (Fig. 5B), confirming the
antiapoptotic properties of KIAA0358. These prosurvival effects
were associated with nearly complete dampening of caspase8 activation (Fig. 5C).

caspase-8, we measured the expression of caspase-8 transcripts in
SK-N-SH cells treated with the different combinations of siRNAs.
We found that SK-N-SH cells in which all isoforms were
down-modulated, leaving expression of IG20-SV4 unperturbed
(13L + 34E), expressed increased levels of caspase-8 mRNA
compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). To confirm
that the increased expression of caspase-8 was due to induction of
gene expression, we exposed the cells to 10 Ag/mL of cycloheximide as an inhibitor of new protein synthesis. This inhibited the
expression of caspase-8 protein (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the effects
of IG20-SV manipulation were mediated at the level of CASP8 gene
expression. This result was further confirmed by using a luciferase
assay, in which overexpression of IG20-SV4 caused a significant
(4-fold) increase in activation of the CASP8 promoter compared
with control or pEFYP-c1 (empty vector; Fig. 6B).

Inhibition of Caspase-8 Effectively Decreases
Apoptosis in 13L- and 34E + 13L–Transduced SK-N-SH
Cells in a Dose-Dependent Manner
We then pretreated the cells with the specific caspase-8 inhibitor
Z-IETD-FMK (40 and 80 Amol/L), which significantly attenuated

the apoptotic effect caused by down-modulation of KIAA0358 in a
dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6C). The inhibitory effect of Z-IETDFMK on caspase-8 expression was confirmed by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 6D). Inhibition of caspase-8 did not significantly
affect apoptosis in cells treated with shRNA targeting 34E (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Previously reported cDNAs, designated MADD and DENN, share
the same location on human chromosome 11p11 as IG20, which
comprises 36 exons (4, 5, 14, 15). Other proteins with high
homology and almost identical death domains have been
discovered and include rat Rab3-GEP, a GDP/GTP exchange
protein (28, 29), and KIAA0358, a human brain protein of
unknown function (30). Since the publishing of these reports, it
has become clear that IG20, MADD, DENN, and KIAA0358 are
different isoforms of the same gene (6) that stem from alternative
splicing of exons 13L, 16, 21, 26, and 34. In fact, a total of seven
putative IG20-SVs have been identified (i.e., IG20pa, MADD, DENNSV, IG20-SV2, KIAA0358, IG20-SV4, and IG20-FL; ref. 6, 7). IG20-SVs

can differentially regulate cell proliferation and death in nonneuronal cell lines (4–10).
In the current study, we first observed that IG20-SVs are highly
expressed in select nervous system tissues and discovered that
KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4, which are not highly expressed in
nonneural cells, were significantly expressed in cerebral cortex,
hippocampus, and, to a lesser extent, spinal cord. We therefore
designated IG20-SV4 and KIAA0358 as ‘‘neural-enriched’’ IG20SVs. These neural-enriched isoforms were also found to be
expressed in two neuroblastoma cell lines (SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y)

www.aacrjournals.org

known to be deficient in caspase-8 expression, but not in the
SK-N-BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cell line, which is known to express
caspase-8. There was relatively little mRNA expression of neuralenriched IG20-SVs in human cerebellum or skeletal muscle. The
differential presence of these neural-specific IG20-SVs is consistent with current evidence of tissue-specific differences in
alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs (31, 32).
To investigate the physiologic relevance of the expression of the
neural-enriched IG20-SVs in neuroblastoma cells, we down-modulated select combinations of IG20-SVs using siRNAs in SK-N-SH and

SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We found that down-modulation of
MADD/DENN using shRNA targeting exon 13L enhanced spontaneous apoptosis (SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y) and TNFa-induced
apoptosis (SK-N-SH). It is important to understand that the 13L
siRNA will also down-modulate KIAA0358 expression. As expected,
down-modulation of all IG20-SVs also resulted in enhanced
apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells in SK-N-SH cells, although not
significantly in SH-SY5Y cells. However, selective down-modulation
of IG20pa, MADD, IG20-SV2, and DENN-SV, allowing for unaltered
endogenous expression of IG20-SV4 and KIAA0358, resulted in
markedly enhanced cellular survival in both neuroblastoma cell
lines. In contrast, knockdown of all splice isoforms except for IG20SV4 caused a significant enhancement of apoptosis in both SK-N-SH
and SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggested that KIAA0358 exerts a
predominant suppressive effect on IG20-SV4 in certain neuroblastoma cells.
Because previous studies have shown that MADD/DENN acts
as a negative regulator of caspase-8 activation in nonneural cells
(33), we hypothesized that the mechanism responsible for
enhanced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells mediated by manipulation of IG20-SV4 and KIAA0358 expression involves activation
of caspase-8. Whereas the expression of KIAA0358 and IG20-SV4
in selected primary neuroblastoma tumor lines did not suggest a
reciprocal relationship between IG20-SVs and caspase-8, we
hypothesized that these IG20-SVs may be involved in the
regulation of caspase-8 activation in neuroblastoma cells.
We first noted that caspase-8 expression was increased in cells
in which KIAA0358 was down-modulated (treated with 13L and
34E + 13 siRNAs and, to a lesser extent, in cells in which all
IG20-SVs were knocked down). When transduced SK-N-SH cells
were treated with cycloheximide, the induced caspase-8 was
inhibited, consistent with it being newly synthesized protein, and
suggesting that the pattern of IG20-SV4 and KIAA0358
expression may be involved in the regulation of CASP8 gene
expression. This was confirmed by showing the effect of IG20SV4 on the activation of the CASP8 promoter using a luciferase
assay. The marked activation of the CASP8 promoter by IG20SV4 is direct evidence that IG20-SVs may exert their effects
through regulation of CASP8 gene expression. As expected,
inhibition of caspase-8 protected cells from undergoing apoptosis
only when KIAA0358 was down-modulated (i.e., using 13L, 34E +
13L, and Mid-siRNAs).
This argued strongly that the mechanism of enhanced apoptosis
in these cells was related to caspase-8 expression and activation.
Furthermore, the selective expression of IG20-SV4 sensitized
neuroblastoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of TNFa, and this
sensitization was suppressed by DN-FADD, offering further support
for the mechanistic role of caspase-8 in the enhancement of both
spontaneous and TNFa-induced apoptosis mediated by selective
overexpression of IG20-SV4. Whether these effects occur at the level
of the death-inducing signaling complex or possibly after dissociation from TNFR1 (i.e., complex II; ref. 34) will be explored in future
studies.
Whereas the levels of apoptosis and caspase-8 activation were
very high in neuroblastoma cells in which all IG20-SVs except IG20SV4 were down-modulated, selective expression of KIAA0358 in the
presence of IG20-SV4 (or in the setting of down-modulation of all
other isoforms) effectively prevented apoptosis and caspase-8
expression, suggesting that KIAA0358 may have a dominantnegative effect on IG20-SV4. To further confirm the prosurvival
effects of KIAA0358 on neuroblastoma cell survival, we generated

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

SK-N-SH cells stably expressing a mutant KIAA0358, which
contained silent mutations that did not affect protein expression
but prevented down-modulation of KIAA0358 by Mid-shRNA; the
cell was transduced with Mid-shRNA for 5 days. As expected,
SK-N-SH cell lines expressing this KIAA0358 mutant were largely
resistant to apoptosis compared with control cells treated with
Mid-shRNA. This effect was accompanied by a nearly complete
dampening of caspase-8 activation. Whereas the effects of
manipulation of neural IG20-SVs were similar in the SK-N-SH
and SH-SY5Y cell lines (both deficient in caspase-8), we observed
no effect of introduction of either IG20-SV4 or KIAA0358 on
caspase-8 expression in the SK-N-BE(2)-C cell line, which has
constitutive expression of caspase-8, suggesting that the effects of
IG20-SV expression are likely tissue or cell dependent (33).
Silencing of the CASP8 gene may play a role in neuroblastoma
tumor progression by the induction of tumor cell resistance to
apoptosis induced by cytotoxic agents, or by death-inducing ligands
such as TNFa or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (17–19, 35,
36). Induction of caspase-8 expression by gene transfer in
neuroblastoma cells has been shown to confer sensitivity to death
receptor ligands and to their combinations with cytotoxic agents
(23, 37). Further, IFN-g can sensitize neoplastic cells to apoptosis
through up-regulation of caspase-8 (18), and an IFN-sensitive
response element in the caspase-8 promoter may play a role in this
IFN-g–driven regulation of caspase-8 expression in cancer cells (23).
The regulation of caspase-8 expression likely involves other complex
interactions involving the CASP8 gene. Our results suggest that the
expression of IG20-SVs may play a role in determining caspase8 expression/activation and susceptibility to apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.
In summary, we show for the first time that proapoptotic
signaling caused by down-modulation of KIAA0358 or overexpression of IG20-SV4 effectively induces spontaneous apoptosis
and sensitization to TNFa-induced apoptosis through expression
and activation of caspase-8 in neuroblastoma cells known to be
deficient in caspase-8. Furthermore, enhanced expression of IG20SV4 alone can overcome the transcriptional inhibition of the
CASP8 gene and up-regulate its expression, whereas KIAA0358 acts
as a negative regulator of caspase-8 expression and activation in
these cells. Further study examining the precise mode of action of
IG20-SVs in modulating the expression of caspase-8 in neuroblastoma and other cancer cells may elucidate novel targets that can be
manipulated to enhance apoptosis (both spontaneous and in
response to cytotoxic drugs) in cancer cells and is currently under
investigation.
