Abstract
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells plays a pivotal role in determining metastatic
prowess, but knowledge of EMT regulation remains incomplete. In this study, we defined a critical functional
role for the Forkhead transcription factor FOXQ1 in regulating EMT in breast cancer cells. FOXQ1 expression
was correlated with high-grade basal-like breast cancers and was associated with poor clinical outcomes. RNAimediated suppression of FOXQ1 expression in highly invasive human breast cancer cells reversed EMT, reduced
invasive ability, and alleviated other aggressive cancer phenotypes manifested in 3-dimensional Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) culture. Conversely, enforced expression of FOXQ1 in differentiated human mammary epithelial
cells (HMLER) or epithelial cancer cell lines provoked an epithelial to mesenchymal morphologic change, gain of
stem cell–like properties, and acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that FOXQ1-induced EMT was associated with transcriptional inactivation of the
epithelial regulator E-cadherin (CDH1). Our findings define a key role for FOXQ1 in regulating EMT and
aggressiveness in human cancer. Cancer Res; 71(8); 3076–86. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis of tumor cells to distant organs is the most
common cause of death arising from human carcinomas.
During the metastatic cascade, carcinoma cells often activate
a transdifferentiation step known as epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), a dynamic cellular process thought to
underlie metastasis by promoting acquisition of migratory
and invasive abilities (1, 2). Evidence is accumulating for a
prominent role of EMT in tumor progression (reviewed by
Polyak and Weinberg, ref. 3). E-cadherin (encoded by CDH1)
has been proposed to be a critical switch in EMT. On
downregulation of E-cadherin, epithelial cells acquire a
fibroblastic phenotype, dissociate from the epithelium, and
migrate. Several proteins have been identified that can downregulate E-cadherin expression including SNAIL, SLUG,

ZEB1, ZEB2/SIP1, as well as the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
factors TWIST1 and E47 (reviewed by Peinado and colleagues, ref. 4). These proteins bind to E-box elements in the
promoter region of E-cadherin, together with other corepressors, leading to transcriptional inactivation of E-cadherin and
subsequent breakdown of cell junction and the ensuing loss
of cell polarity (5). Consistent with a central role of Ecadherin loss in EMT induction, transcriptional downregulation of E-cadherin is associated with a more aggressive
behavior of breast cancer (6).
Cancer cells with different molecular characteristics may
have different response to anticancer therapeutics (7).
Recently, the induction of EMT in cancer has been associated
with increased resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, the
induction of EMT in normal or neoplastic mammary epithelial
cell populations has been shown to generate cells with stemlike properties including gain of cell surface antigen CD44þ/
CD24/low (8, 9), and cancer stem cell–enriched population
exhibits increased resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (10–
15). These findings have provided an intriguing connection
between EMT, cancer stem cells, and drug resistance.
Forkhead transcription factor FOXC2 has been recently
implicated in aggressive basal-like breast cancer with a role
in regulating EMT and metastasis (16). In this study, we have
identified FOXQ1 as another member of the forkhead transcription factor family that is also involved in EMT regulation
and is associated with aggressive cancer phenotype. However,
unlike FOXC2 that does not seem to affect E-cadherin transcription, FOXQ1-induced EMT is accompanied by transcriptional repression of E-cadherin without engaging other known
upstream repressors of E-cadherin.

FOXQ1 Regulates Cancer EMT

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and drugs
The cell lines used in this study were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection. Immortalized human
mammary epithelial cell line HMLE expressing hTERT and
SV40 large T and a low level of oncogenic HRAS (Val 12)
(referred to as HMLER) was a generous gift from Dr. W.C.
Hahn at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. All the basal and
luminal breast cancer cell lines are authenticated on the basis
of morphology and expressions of epithelial marker E-cadherin or mesenchymal marker vimentin (Vim). HMLER cells
were cultured in F12 with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/mL EGF, 0.5
mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and 10 mg/
mL insulin. MDA-MB-231 FOXQ1 knockdown cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with
10% FBS and 2 mg/mL puromycin. All culture reagents and
medium were purchased from Invitrogen. 5-Flurouracil (5FU), paclitaxel (Taxol), camptothecin (CPT), adriamycin
(ADR), and doxycycline (Dox) were purchased from Sigma.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was purchased from Enzo Life Science.
Plasmids and stable cell lines
Full-length FOXQ1 coding region was isolated by reverse
transcriptase (RT)-PCR from normal colon tissue. To generate
FOXQ1 retroviral expression system, Myc-tagged FOXQ1 was
cloned into pMN GFP/IRES retroviral vector (a gift from Dr
Linda Penn's lab), HMLER cells were infected with retrovirus
packaged with pMN-FOXQ1-myc and pMN empty vector for
48 hours and followed by GPF sorting. To generate the FOXQ1
Tet-on inducible cell lines, HCT116 stable cell line expressing
pcDNA6-TR (Invitrogen) and selected with Blasticidin (10mg/
mL) was used as host cells, and transfected with pcDNA4.0/
TO/FOXQ1-myc and selected for Zeocin (100 mg/mL). The
generated clones were screened for Dox inducible expression
of FOXQ1. For Dox treatment, inducible cells were treated with
Dox to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. The FOXQ1 shRNA
lentiviral particle containing 3 individual FOXQ1 shRNA
sequences was purchased from Santa Cruz, and PLKO–Ecadherin shRNA and PLKO–control plasmid were purchased
from Addgene. Additional FOXQ1 shRNA sequence (AGATCAACGAGTACCTCAT) was subcloned into pSIREN-RetroQpuromycin vector (Clontech), and retroviral particles were
produced in Platinum-A cells (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). MDA-MB231 cells were infected with shFOXQ1 lentiviral and retroviral
particles and a negative control for 48 hours and followed by 2
mg/mL puromycin selection. HMLER cells were infected with
shE-cadherin and a negative control for 48 hours and followed
by 4 mg/mL puromycin selection.
Invasion assay
Analysis of cell invasion was performed by 24-well FluoroBlok transwell insert (BD) with 8-mm pore size. Inserts were
prepared by coating the upper surface with 250 ng/mL growth
factor reduced Matrigel (BD356231; BD Biosciences) for 4 to
6 hours at incubator. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into the
insert with 5  104 per insert with DMEM containing 0.25%

www.aacrjournals.org

FBS, and bottom medium is DMEM with 10% FBS. After
24 hours incubation, inserts were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with propidium iodide. Invaded cells were
scanned and counted by using high content screening machine
(Cellomics ArrayScan VTI) for 10 individual fields for each
insert. At least 3 independent experiments were repeated.
Luciferase reporter assay
The E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter region (from 450 to
þ193 bp) has been cloned into pGL3-basic promoter vector
(Promega). HMLER and MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in
12-well plates at a density of 1  105 cells/well and transfected
with CDH1 promoter plasmid or control plasmid and PRLnull plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the luciferase activities were analyzed by the Dual Luciferase system
according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). Three
independent experiments were performed.
Immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis
Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5  105 cells/well on
8 mm coverslips in 12-well plates. After 48 hours, coverslips
were fixed by ice-cold methanol, and probed with primary
Myc-tag (9E10; Roche), E-cadherin (BD610182), or Vim (SC6260) antibodies in 1/100 to 1/1,000 dilution and florescentlabeled secondary antibodies in a 1/2,000 dilution. Nuclear
DNA was stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
and coverslips were mounted with FluorSave reagent (CALBIOCHEM). Confocal images were taken by Zeiss Meta
upright microscope under 63 oil objective. Immunoblotting
was performed as follows: cells were harvested and lysed with
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors]. Protein
concentrations were determined with the Bradford protein
assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (20–30 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and blotted with E-cadherin (BD610182),
Vim (SC-6260), Myc-tag (9E10, Roche), CD44 (BD550392),
CD24 (BD555426), FOXQ1 (Sigma AV39755), cleaved-PARP
(C.S.D214), and actin (Roche).
Cell viability and Caspase-3 activity assay
Cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay (Promega). MDA-MB-231 cells and HMLER
cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells/well in 96-well plates.
Cells were lysed after indicated days by 100 mL of CellTiter-Glo
reagents, and the luminescence signals were measured by MicroLumat Plus LB96V system. Six replicas were performed for each
sample. Active Caspase-3 activities were measured by using
BD cytofix/cytoperm fixation/permeabilization kit with FITC
Rabbit antiactive Caspase-3 antibody (BD559341), based on
the manufacturer's instructions and followed by FACS analysis.
Mammosphere formation assay and 3-dimensional
culture on Matrigel
Single-cell suspension of HMLER-FOXQ1 and negative
control were plated (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well ultra-low
attachment plates (Corning) in MammoCult medium with
hydrocortisone and heparin (STEMCELL Technologies) and

cultured for 7 days. For mammosphere numbers calculation,
single-cell suspension (100 cells/well) were plated in 96-well
ultra-low attachment plates in MammoCult medium hydrocortisone and heparin for 7 days, sizes more than 100 mm were
counted under microscope. For 3-dimensional (3D) culture of
cells on Matrigel, MDA-MB-231 FOXQ1 knockdown and control cells were plated (5,000 cells/well) in 8-well chamber slide
(BD) on a solidified layer of 7.6 mg/mL growth factor reduced
Matrigel (BD356231) measuring approximately 1 to 2 mm in
thickness with DMEM containing 2% FBS and 2% Matrigel
and the medium were replaced for every 4 days. Phase
contrast images of the 3D structure were taken on day 12.
Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated by using Trizol (Invitrogen) and
purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The microarray
hybridization was performed by the Illumina Gene Expression
Sentrix BeadChip HumanRef-8_V3, and data analysis was
performed by GeneSpring software from Agilent Technologies
as described (17). The analyzed gene sets by GeneSpring were
next subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for gene
ontology (GO) analysis. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
was performed by PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). Briefly, reverse transcription was performed by an RNA Amplification kit (Ambion), and cDNA were
next amplified by FOXQ1, E-cadherin, Vim, CD44, CD24, and
GAPDH Taqman probes (Appliedbiosystems). Three independent experiments were performed for quantitative real-time
RT-PCR.
Dataset and survival analysis
The breast cancer dataset from the van de Vijver cohort
with relevant clinical information has been described previously (18). The expression of probes of each FOXQ1 gene
was averaged and transformed to z-score. The positive z-score
was treated as higher expression and the negative z-score was
treated as lower expression. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis
was used for the analysis of clinical outcome. For multivariate
analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to
estimate the HRs of breast cancer patient survival for FoxQ1,
along with estrogen receptor (ER) status (1 for ERþ and 0 for
ER), lymph node status (1 for LNþ and 0 for LN) and grade
(1 for grade 1, 0 for grade 2, and þ1 for grade 3).

Results
FOXQ1 expression is associated with aggressive breast
cancer
To identify additional EMT regulators within the forkhead
transcription factor family, we performed gene expression
profiling analysis and compared the expression levels of forkhead transcription factor members between the highly invasive and mesenchymal-like breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells
and noninvasive epithelial breast cancer MCF7 cells, by using
Illumina Beadchip. The result shows that of all 49 forkhead
family members presented in the array FOXQ1 was the most
highly overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with
MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). To further verify the array data and to

3078

extend the analysis in other breast cancer cell lines, we further
performed quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in
multiple breast cancer cell lines, including aggressive and
basal MDA-MB-231, BT549, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB436 cells and nonbasal epithelial MCF-7, T47D, SKBR-3,
BT474, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-415 cells, as well as
noncancerous mammary epithelial MCF10A and HMLER cells.
The results show that FOXQ1 was consistently expressed in
higher levels in aggressive breast cancer cells than that in
nonaggressive breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B). Of note, FOXQ1
mRNA and protein levels were not always consistent, indicating that FOXQ1 expression might also be subject to posttranslational regulation.
To seek clinical evidence linking FOXQ1 expression to
breast cancer, we examined the FOXQ1 expression in Oncomine database (19). The data from various breast cancer
cohorts showed that the FOXQ1 expression correlated with
a higher tumor grade (P ¼ 0.0007), metastasis (P ¼ 0.003), and
is highly enriched in unfavorable ER/progesterone (PR)/HER2
triple-negative basal-like subtype (P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 1C). Moreover, higher FOXQ1 expression is also associated with poor
clinical outcomes (Fig. 1D, P ¼ 0.002). In a multivariate
analysis of FOXQ1 together with ER, lymph node, or tumor
grade status, FOXQ1 expression status retained independent
prognostic significance (HR ¼ 2.9; P ¼ 0.0078), along with ER
(HR ¼ 0.53; P ¼ 0.01) and high histologic grade (HR =, P ¼ 6.3e5; Supplementary Table S1). These results from both in vitro
and clinical data suggest that FOXQ1 might play a role in
aggressive subtype of breast cancers.
FOXQ1 depletion reduces mesenchymal phenotype and
invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells
To functionally validate the role of FOXQ1 in aggressive
breast cancers, we established a stable MDA-MB-231 cell line
expressing 3 pooled individual short hairpin RNAs purchased
from Santa Cruz (shRNA-SC) targeting FOXQ1, and additional
2 stable clones expressing an independent FOXQ1 shRNA
(#02-09 and #02-12). Notably, FOXQ1 ablation in all settings
induced a change from spindle-like mesenchymal morphology
of MDA-MB-231 cells into epithelial morphology by manifesting an increased cell-to-cell adhesion (Fig. 2A). Consistent
with the phenotypic change associated with FOXQ1-depletion
was an increased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin
(CDH1) concomitant with a downregulation of mesenchymal
marker Vim, as determined at both mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 2B). These changes of EMT markers were also verified by
immunofluorescent confocal analysis (Fig. 2B). Thus, FOXQ1
depletion resulted in a reversal of EMT in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Furthermore, FOXQ1 depletion also markedly reduced the
invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells in all 3 FOXQ1 ablation
cell lines, as assessed by the technique of transwell invasion
assay (Fig. 2C). This reduction of invasion should not be due
to reduced cell proliferation, as FOXQ1 ablation did not
change the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2C,
bottom). When cultured on Matrigel to assess the 3D growth
potential, the control MDA-MB-231 cells displayed aggressive
phenotype by showing highly disorganized structures of cell
cluster lacking basal polarity, whereas the MDA-MB-231 cells

depleted of FOXQ1 showed more uniform and polarized
acinar structures (Fig. 2D).
Enforced expression of FOXQ1 in human mammary
epithelial cells induces EMT and mammosphere
formation
We next examined whether enforced expression of FOXQ1
in human mammary epithelial cells is able to trigger mesenchymal phenotype. To achieve this, we used a semitransformed
human mammary epithelial cell line (HMLER; ref. 20) as a
model in which overexpression of EMT regulator Snail or
Twist1 has been shown to induce EMT (8). We established a
stable HMLER cell line expressing FOXQ1 through retroviral
induction (designated as HMLER-FOXQ1). We found that
although the HMLER cells expressing a control vector retained
an epithelial morphology with tight cell-to-cell adhesion,
HMLER-FOXQ1 cells displayed an elongated morphology
typically associated with mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 3A).

Further, this morphologic change in HMELR-FOXQ1 cells was
accompanied by marked reduction of E-cadherin (CDH1)
expression and increased expression of Vim at both mRNA
and protein levels (Fig. 3A). These changes of EMT markers
were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining of E-cadherin
and Vim (Fig. 3A). These findings suggested that enforced
expression of FOXQ1 in HMLER cells can result in induction
of EMT.
Recent studies have shown that human mammary
epithelial cells undergoing EMT often exhibit a gain of stem
cell–like characteristics, including changes of certain cell
surface markers specifically increased expression of breast
stem cell marker CD44, and reduced expression of CD24, as
well as enhanced capacity to form spherical colonies in
serum-free suspension cultures, termed mammospheres
(8, 21). To test whether FOXQ1 overexpression in HMLER
cells can also result in similar stem cell–like properties, we
assessed the alterations in expression of CD44 and CD24 in

supports a role of FOXQ1 in driving the formation of

Ectopic FOXQ1 expression induces EMT in epithelial
colorectal cancer cells
To extend our analysis, we wanted to determine whether
FOXQ1 can also induce EMT in epithelial cancer cells.
FOXQ1 has been recently found to be overexpressed in
colon cancer (23). In a series of colon cancer cell lines that
we have examined, FOXQ1 was found to be silenced in
HCT116 cells although it is expressed abundantly in other
colon cancer cell lines, as determined by both quantitative
RT-PCR and Western blot (Fig. 4A). The silencing of
FOXQ1 in HCT116 cells was caused by DNA methylation
of the promoter as revealed by a large scale DNA methylome analysis in HCT116 cells (data not shown). HCT116
cells exhibit a typical epithelial morphology and thus
may provide an ideal model to examine the potential of
FOXQ1 to induce EMT in epithelial cancer cells. We
established a Tet-on inducible HCT116 cell line, designated
as HCT116-FOXQ1, in which FOXQ1 tagged with Myc is
expressed on Dox treatment. We found that although the

vector control HCT116 cells retained an epithelial morphology with or without adding Dox, HCT116-FOXQ1 cell
cultured in the presence of Dox displayed a fibroblast-like
morphology (Fig. 4B), reminiscent of EMT induction.
Moreover, removal of Dox from the culture medium to
eliminate FOXQ1 expression resulted in a reversal of
epithelial to mesenchymal morphology (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the acquisition of EMT morphology in HCT116FOXQ1 cells was the downregulation of E-cadherin and
upregulation of Vim (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescent confocal
imaging analysis confirmed the above molecular changes
on E-cadherin and Vim at single cell level (Fig. 4D), further
substantiating a role of FOXQ1 in inducing EMT in epithelial cancer cells. Therefore, FOXQ1 might have a broader
role in modulating cancer EMT. However, we also noticed
that ectopic FOXQ1 expression was unable to induce EMT
in breast epithelial MCF-7 cells or lung epithelial cancer
A549 cells (data not shown). These results suggested that
FOXQ1 alone was insufficient, but, depending on the

to provoke EMT.
FOXQ1 overexpression confers resistance to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
Cancer cells undergoing EMT has recently been connected to chemoresistance (24). We next investigated
whether FOXQ1 has a role to play in drug-induced apoptosis. We found that FOXQ1 depletion in MDA-MB-231

chemotherapeutic reagents, including 5-FU, paclitaxel, and
CPT, as assessed by Caspase-3 activation assay (Fig. 5A).
Conversely, ectopic expression of FOXQ1 in HCT116 cells

resulted in reduced PARP cleavage in response to 5-FU as
compared with control HCT116 cells (Fig. 5B). It also
decreased apoptotic response to CPT, ADR, or SAHA as
assessed by FACS analysis of active Caspase-3 activity
(Fig. 5C). Hence, our results showed that FOXQ1 deregulation not only induces EMT to influence cancer progression but can also confer resistance to chemotherapyinduced apoptosis.

gene sets (bottom). The top 5 gene functions were listed. C, IPA showing the top network of FOXQ1-downregulated genes with CDH1 as a central node.
D, E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter reporter activities were measured in HMLER control and FOXQ1 expressing cells (left), and in MDA-MB-231 control
and FOXQ1 knockdown cells (right).

we performed transcriptional profiling on HMLER cells
expressing either control vector or FOXQ1 as well as MDAMB-231 cells expressing either control or FOXQ1 shRNA. We
aimed at identifying the common gene sets that are either
positively or negatively regulated by FOXQ1 in both scenarios.
To this end, we have identified a set of 63 genes that were
upregulated on FOXQ1 overexpression in HMLER, but downregulated on FOXQ1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells (using
5-fold cutoff; Fig. 6A and B; Supplementary Table S2). Vice
versa, a set of 206 genes were found to be downregulated by
FOXQ1 (using 5-fold cutoff; Fig. 6A and B; Supplementary
Table S3). GO analysis revealed that genes downregulated by
FOXQ1 were most enriched for gene sets related to cell
morphology or migration and motility (Fig. 6B), thus supporting a functional role of FOXQ1 in regulation of EMT. In
contrast, genes positively regulated by FOXQ1 were not
enriched with such gene function categories related to
EMT (Fig. 6B). In addition, IPA of FOXQ1-downregulated gene
set revealed a top gene network with functions in cellular
movement, connected with CDH1 (E-cadherin) as a central
node (Fig. 6C), further confirming the importance of E-cadherin–associated gene expression program in FOXQ1-induced
EMT. Thus, the above observation suggests that FOXQ1induced EMT mainly through its function to repress gene
expression. Consistent with this notion, we did not observe
any increased expression of known EMT inducers that act to

3084

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

repress E-cadherin expression, including SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB1/
2, and TWIST1 during FOXQ1-induced EMT induction. This
suggests that E-cadherin transcriptional inactivation during
FOXQ1-induced EMT is not a result of induction of wellknown upstream repressors of CDH1.
To determine whether FOXQ1 inhibits E-cadherin transcription, we performed E-cadherin promoter reporter assay
to examine the effect of FOXQ1 overexpression or depletion on
E-cadherin luciferase reporter activity in the region of
upstream 450 bp to downstream 193 bp. The results showed
that FOXQ1 overexpression in HMLER cells conferred
decreased E-cadherin promoter activity, whereas FOXQ1
depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in an opposite effect
(Fig. 6D). These findings suggest that FOXQ1 modulated EMT
is able to suppress E-cadherin transcription. However, our
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis failed to
detect a convincing FOXQ1 enrichment at the proximal
E-cadherin promoter region containing the E-box.

Discussion
Here we have shown a functional role of FOXQ1 in promoting EMT in both human mammary epithelial cells and colorectal epithelial cancer cells. In agreement with in vitro analysis,
gene expression in silico analysis of breast cancer gene expression database also revealed that FOXQ1 was expressed at

higher levels in aggressive breast cancer subpopulations and is
clinically associated with poorer prognosis of breast cancer
patients. Strikingly, FOXQ1 expression is also correlated with
most of the colon carcinoma cell lines, and ectopic expression
FOXQ1 in one of the FOXQ1-deficient epithelial carcinoma cell
not only induce EMT but also make these cells become drug
resistant. These results suggest FOXQ1 is envisioned to play a
role in the progression of breast cancer in patients, as well as
exert functional impact in colon carcinoma. Collectively,
FOXQ1 is believed to have a wide influence on tumor development.
Gene expression analysis has shed light on the mechanisms underlying FOXQ1-induced EMT. We found that Ecadherin–associated gene expression program could be a
major target inactivated by FOXQ1. Meanwhile, other wellknown EMT regulators were not found to be affected by
FOXQ1, thereby emphasizing that E-cadherin loss may be
the main event in FOXQ1-induced EMT program. Moreover,
consistent with previous report (22), we confirmed that
E-cadherin knockdown could be sufficient to induce EMT
in human mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, a recent
paper reported that enforced expression of E-cadherin in
mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells can trigger an epithelial phenotype (25). Thus, transcriptional inactivation of
E-cadherin is a functionally relevant target of FOXQ1induced EMT. Our result therefore distinguishes from
another forkhead transcription factor FOXC2, which has
been shown to induce EMT without affecting E-cadherin
mRNA level, but instead relocate E-cadherin from the
plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (9). However, unlike
other known E-cadherin repressors, such as SNAIL (26, 27),
SIP1 (28), SLUG (29, 30), TWIST1 (31) that downregulate
E-cadherin by binding to E-box of the promoter, our
ChIP analysis failed to detect an enrichment of FOXQ1 at
E-cadherin promoter. Therefore, it remains to be determined
which factor transcriptional repress E-cadherin as a direct
target during FOXQ1-induced EMT program.
Beginning with the isolation of CD44þ/CD24/low breast
tumor–initiating cells (21, 26, 32), a number of studies have
isolated tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSC)
with self-renewal properties in a number of solid malignancies and cancer cell lines (27, 28). Compelling evidence exists
relating EMT to the emergence of CSC-like phenotype, which
may be prerequisites for cancer cell metastasis (33). Experimental evidence showing a direct connection of EMT to
stem cells has recently been reported by Weinberg and
colleagues (8). Thus, inducing EMT in differentiated human
mammary epithelial cells by repressing E-cadherin gives rise
to CD44þ/CD24/low CSCs (7, 8). These phenotype changes
were also observed through FOXQ1 overexpression in the
same cell system. Moreover, consistent with the high level of
expression of FOXQ1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, a recent study
has shown that more than 30% of MDA-MB-231 cells display
CD44þ/CD24/low phenotype (33). Therefore, these findings
may indicate a role of FOXQ1 in cancer EMT and possible
CSC regulation.
Cancer therapy has often been associated with acquired
resistance. An increasing body of literature now suggests

www.aacrjournals.org

that acquired resistance to chemotherapy is likely to be
linked to acquired EMT (34). For instance, elevated Ecadherin expression or increased mesenchymal phenotype
can result in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
kinase inhibitor (27) or DNA damaging agent–induced
apoptosis (28). Moreover, chemotherapy leading to an
increase in the number of CD44þ/CD24/low CSCs (29)
may represent a potentially important mechanism of
acquired drug resistance. Therefore, in addition to the gain
of self-renewal ability of cancer cells undergoing EMT, they
also become chemoresistant at the same time. Consistent
with this reasoning, we have shown that FOXQ1 depletion in
MDA-MB-231 cells can result in sensitization to a variety of
chemotherapeutic agents whereas enforced expression of
FOXQ1 in epithelial cancer cells can induce chemoresistance. A recent report indicated that FOXQ1 is overexpressed in colon cancer and contributes to drug
resistance by upregulating cell cycle checkpoint regulator
p21 (23). Therefore, FOXQ1 may play a broader role with
respect to multiple drug resistance in human cancer and
this is likely to be achieved through more than one single
mechanism.
Here, we emphasize that triple-negative breast cancers
(ER/PR/HER2-negative) comprises approximately 15% of
total breast cancer population. Despite their high incidence rate, triple-negative breast cancers are extremely
difficult to treat and the outcomes are usually not desirable. The other obstacle of breast cancer treatment is
their tendency to relapse and metastasize to distant sites.
Hence, any treatment regimen that targets proteins
involved in EMT pathways and CSC maintenance has to
be a promising therapeutic strategy as it aims to eliminate
any surviving cancer cells to prevent recurrence while
improving the long-term prognosis of breast cancer
patients. In view of the relevance of EMT to disease progression in cancer pathology, our work which has shown
sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy on FOXQ1
depletion therefore opens up a novel prospect for future
cancer therapy through modulation of cellular FOXQ1
activities.
