Abstract
Altered metabolism in cancer cells is suspected to contribute to chemoresistance, but the precise mechanisms
are unclear. Here, we show that intracellular ATP levels are a core determinant in the development of acquired
cross-drug resistance of human colon cancer cells that harbor different genetic backgrounds. Drug-resistant cells
were characterized by defective mitochondrial ATP production, elevated aerobic glycolysis, higher absolute levels
of intracellular ATP, and enhanced HIF-1a–mediated signaling. Interestingly, direct delivery of ATP into crosschemoresistant cells destabilized HIF-1a and inhibited glycolysis. Thus, drug-resistant cells exhibit a greater "ATP
debt" deﬁned as the extra amount of ATP needed to maintain homeostasis of survival pathways under genotoxic
stress. Direct delivery of ATP was sufﬁcient to render drug-sensitive cells drug resistant. Conversely, depleting
ATP by cell treatment with an inhibitor of glycolysis, 3-bromopyruvate, was sufﬁcient to sensitize cells crossresistant to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs. In revealing that intracellular ATP levels are a core determinant of
chemoresistance in colon cancer cells, our ﬁndings may offer a foundation for new improvements to colon cancer
treatment. Cancer Res; 72(1); 304–14. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Acquired chemoresistance is one of the major challenges in
patients with advanced stage malignancies. Studies have
revealed genetic and epigenetic alterations that cancer cells
acquire to adapt to chemotherapeutic stress for survival
purposes. Such alterations include increases in drug efﬂux,
enhanced drug inactivation, enhanced DNA damage repair,
mutations of survival-related genes, deregulated growth factor
signaling pathways, increases in antiapoptotic gene expressions, and activation of intracellular survival signaling. Different types of cancer cells may depend more or less on some of
these survival mechanisms (1). Advances are being made in

identifying gene signatures that may predict drug-speciﬁc
resistance prior to chemotherapy (2, 3). However, cancers that
are resistant to one type of chemotherapeutic are often resistant to other chemotherapeutics, which is often referred to as
cross-resistance, ultimately leads to treatment failure in nearly
all patients with metastatic disease (4). The phenomenon of
cross-resistance indicates that there might be a more centralized mechanism that cancer cells use to resist chemotherapeutic stresses.
Cell death can be executed by different mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis, or combinations of these
processes. Although different cell death mechanisms are
unique in their molecular signaling cascades, one molecule is
involved in the processes that mediate all types of cell death,
ATP. During late-stage apoptosis, ATP levels sharply drop,
mostly because of the loss of mitochondrial function and
consumption by ATP-dependent proteases. In autophagy, a
rescue process of self-degradation to compensate for energy
paucity is also featured with ATP insufﬁciency prior to cell
death (5, 6). During necrosis, depletion of ATP precedes
mitochondrial permeability changes (7). The fact that ATP
deprivation occurs in all types of cell death suggests that energy
metabolism may play a critical role in the survival of cancer
cells under stress.
Altered energy metabolism, such as enhanced aerobic glycolysis, is not only one of the fundamental phenotypes of
malignant tumors but also plays important roles during tumor
progression, metastasis, and relapse (8–10). The role of metabolic alterations of cancer cells in the development of
acquired chemoresistance remains to be elucidated.
In this study, we developed cross-chemoresistant human
colon cancer cell lines of different genetic backgrounds, HT29

Intracellular ATP in Cancer Cell Chemoresistance

(mutated BRAF and P53, microsatellite stable) and HCT116
(mutated KRAS and PIK3CA, microsatellite unstable; ref. 11), by
long-term culturing of cells in the presence of chemotherapeutic agent, oxaliplatin. We compared the glucose metabolism of drug-resistant cells with that of their parental cells and
investigated the role of absolute level of intracellular ATP in the
development of drug resistance of these cells. We found that
drug-resistant cells showed defective mitochondrial ATP production, enhanced aerobic glycolysis, higher intracellular ATP
levels, and enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1a)–mediated signaling that was reverted by direct delivery of
ATP into cells. Importantly, direct delivery of ATP into cells
caused drug-sensitive parental cells to become drug resistant.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and in vitro chemoresistant model
The human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
The oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR
were developed in our laboratory as previously described (12).
Brieﬂy, cells stably resistant to oxaliplatin were developed by
exposing parental HT29 and HCT116 cells to an initial oxaliplatin dose of 0.1 mmol/L and culturing surviving cells to a
conﬂuence of 80% for 3 passages (6 weeks). The cells that
survived initial oxaliplatin treatment were then exposed to 0.5
mmol/L oxaliplatin for 3 passages (8 weeks) and then 1.0
mmol/L for 3 passages (8 weeks). Finally, the oxaliplatin
concentration was increased to the clinically relevant plasma
concentration of 2 mmol/L for 3 weeks (10 weeks). The
surviving resistant cells were named HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR. All cells were cultured in minimal essential
medium containing 5 mmol/L glucose and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, vitamins, nonessential amino acids,
penicillin–streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine
(Life Technologies). Oxaliplatin-resistant cells were continuously cultured in 2 mmol/L oxaliplatin unless otherwise indicated. Cell viability was measured by a Vi-cell XR cell viability
analyzer (Beckman Coulter). In vitro experiments were carried
out at 70% cell conﬂuence and conﬁrmed in at least 3 independent experiments. All cell lines are authenticated by short
tandem repeats sequencing and matched with 100% accuracy
to the ATCC database.
MTT assay for IC50 determination
Cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay in 96well plates. First, 1,500–3,000 cells per well per 100 mL were
seeded in 96-well plates. On the same day, 100 mL working stock
of drug solution of oxaliplatin or 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) with 2
concentration of the ﬁnal concentration was added to the cell
suspension. After 72 hours drug incubation, 50 mL MTT reagent
was added to each well and incubated for 4 hours. After the
supernatant was removed, the formazan precipitates in the
cells were dissolved in 200 mL dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance
was determined by a MultiSkan plate reader (LabSystems) at
570 nm. Fractional survival was plotted against logarithm of
drug dose, and IC50 values were calculated by Prisms software
(GraphPad Software). Oxaliplatin and 5-FU were purchased

www.aacrjournals.org

from the MD Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy. Both stock
drugs were reconstituted in distilled water and maintained at
room temperature.
Measurement of cellular ATP, ADP, and AMP
Relative cellular ATP content was measured by the ATPbased CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability kit (Promega)
with modiﬁcations from the manufacturer's protocol. Brieﬂy,
cells were plated in 24-well plates at 20,000 cells per well to
allow for attachment overnight. At the desired harvest time, an
equal volume of the single-one-step reagent provided by the kit
was added to each well and rocked for 15 minutes at room
temperature. Cellular ATP content was measured by a luminescent plate reader. An additional plate with the same setup
was used for cell counting by hemocytometer to normalize the
cell number for calculating ATP level. The absolute amounts of
cellular ATP, ADP, and AMP content were measured by the
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrum (HPLC-MS) method. Brieﬂy, exponentially growing cells
were trypsinized and washed with 2.5% glycerol (v/v) once. Cell
pellets were frozen immediately in 100% ethanol with dry ice.
Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL distilled water for
ultrasonic fragmentation to release cellular ATP, ADP, and
AMP. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the
supernatant portions were collected to inject into the HPLCMS machine for measurement of ATP, ADP, and AMP with the
standard protocol. The total cellular ATP, ADP, and AMP
amount was normalized by cell number.
Spectrophotometric assay for phosphofructose kinase
activity
Phosphofructose kinase (PFK) activity was determined as
described previously (13) in an assay mixture containing 50
mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm
(NH4)2SO4, 5 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 10 mmol/L fructose 6phosphate, 0.28 mmol/L NADH, 3 units/mL aldolase, 30 units/
mL triosephosphate isomerase, 10 units/mL a-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and cell lysate containing 50 mg/mL
total protein in a ﬁnal volume of 100 mL. The cell lysate was
incubated with coupling enzymes at 37 C for 10 minutes. The
reaction was started by the addition of NADH and fructose-6phosphate, and NADH oxidation was followed by measuring
the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm measured by a microplate reader at 37 C. Blank controls not containing the cell
lysate were used to control nonspeciﬁc NADH oxidation. The
reaction curves represent the average of triplicate results.
In-plate measurement of mitochondrial oxygen
consumption
Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidiﬁcation rates (ECAR) were measured by a Seahorse XF 24
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Brieﬂy, cells were seeded in
24-well cell culture microplates according to their growth rate
and allowed to attach overnight. Approximately 30 minutes
prior to the assay, culture medium was changed to unrufﬂed
Seahorse assay medium, and OCR/ECAR measurement was
taken by the instrument every 10 minutes up to 2 hours. An
average of quadruplicate readings for one cell line was

recorded and normalized by the number of cells, which were
counted afterward using a Vi-cell XR cell viability analyzer
(Beckman Coulter).
Transmission electron microscopy
Parental and drug-resistant cells were plated in 6-well plates
according to their growth rate and cultured to 70% conﬂuency,
at which time the cells were ﬁxed with a solution containing 3%
glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L cocodlate buffer, pH 7.3, for 1 hour. After ﬁxation, the samples were
submitted to the high-resolution electron microscopy facility
at MD Anderson Cancer Center for processing using a JEM1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc.). Digital images were obtained by the AMT Imaging System
(Advanced Microscopy Techniques). For each cell type, at least
20 individual cells were imaged and analyzed.
Mitochondrial isolation and substrate ATP production
Mitochondrial ATP production was quantiﬁed by the ATP
Bioluminescent Assay obtained from Sigma (FL-AA) with
minor modiﬁcations to the manufacturer's protocol. ATP assay
dilution buffer and ATP assay mix were prepared as directed
using 40 mL of the ATP assay mix and 2 mL of the dilution buffer,
aliquoted in advance, and stored at 80 C. The measurements
were carried out by a white 96-well plate with a 100-mL total
assay volume in each well. To each well, 41 mL of mitochondria
(0.2–1.0 mg) and 4 mL of an electron transport substrate (either
500 mmol/L glutamate plus 500 mmol/L malate, or 500 mmol/
L succinate) was added. To the mitochondrial substrate mixture, 5 mL of 100 mmol/L ADP was added to each reaction to
initiate ATP production at time zero. The reaction was incubated between 30 and 45 seconds, followed by the addition of 50
mL of assay reaction mixture for bioluminescence measurements. Luminescence was recorded, in triplicate, using a BioTek Instruments FLx-800 Fluorescent Microplate Reader
equipped with KC4 BioTek software approximately 2 minutes
after the addition of ADP (initial measurement), and measurements were continued for 10 minutes using the kinetic measurement mode at 1-minute intervals at a sensitivity level of
100. A 0 to 0.25 nmol/L ATP standard curve was generated by a
standard solution of 10 mmol/L ATP. ATP stock concentration
was determined at 259 nm with millimolar extinction coefﬁcient for ATP (EmM) ¼ 15.4 mmol/L1cm1 (14). The value of
ATP produced by mitochondria within 1 minute was normalized by the protein content of the mitochondria, which is
expressed as "nmol ATP/min/mg protein."
Measurement of cellular glycolytic activity
Glycolytic activity in the parental and resistant colon cancer
cells was determined by measuring glucose consumption and
lactate production. Cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture
microplates at 0.5  106 to 1  106 cells per well per 3 mL
according to their growth rate and allowed to attach overnight.
Fresh medium was replaced the next morning approximately 3
hours prior to the assay. Cell culture medium was sampled at
200 mL at 3 time points at 3-hour intervals. The glucose and
lactic acid concentrations of the cell culture medium were
measured by a Dual-Channel Biochemistry Analyzer-2700D

306

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

(YSI Life Sciences). For each time point, triplicate samples were
measured to calculate the average values. Cell numbers were
counted with a Beckman Coulter cell viability analyzer to
normalize the glucose and lactic acid concentrations.
Western blot and antibodies
The antibody against PARP was purchased from Cell Signaling. HIF-1a antibody was purchased from BD Transduction
Laboratories. Glut-1 antibody was purchased from Abcam.
b-actin, p21, and hexokinase II antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. VEGFA antibody was purchased from R&D Systems. Whole-cell lysate was collected
from cells cultured at 70% conﬂuency before Western blot
analysis was applied. VEGF-A secretion into culture medium
was examined using conditioned medium collected and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (15).
Quantitative real-time PCR for VEGF-A
VEGF-A gene expression level in the parental and resistant
cells was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using Taqman
primers (Applied Biosystems) speciﬁc for the VEGF-A gene.
Actin was used as an internal control. Total RNA was extracted
from 60% to 70% conﬂuent tumor cells growing in culture using
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Reverse transcription PCR
was carried out by the First-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). Realtime PCR reaction was carried out using PCR Master Mix
(Roche) on ABI-7500 platform (Applied Biosystems).
Liposome-encapsulated ATP delivery
Encapsulation of ATP into liposomes was carried out
according to a published protocol (16). In brief, chloroform
solution of phosphatidylcholine (0.26 mmol), cholesterol (0.12
mmol), and 1,2 dioleoyl-3-trimethyl-ammonium-propane (10.8
mmol) was evaporated, and the ﬁlm formed was hydrated with/
without 5 mL of 600 mmol/L ATP in Krebs-Henseleit (KH)
buffer. The dispersion was frozen at –80 C for 30 minutes
followed by thawing at 45 C for 5 minutes; this cycle was
repeated 5 times. Nonencapsulated ATP was separated by
dialysis against the KH buffer at 48 C overnight. For each
treatment of cells with liposomes, 10 mL of either control or
ATP liposomes were added into one well of a 6-well cell culture
plate; the well contained 500 mL cell culture medium. Cells were
harvested for analyses at indicated time points after liposome
treatment.

Results
Characterization of chemoresistant phenotype of
cross-resistant cell lines
Cells stably resistant to oxaliplatin were developed by
exposing parental HT29 and HCT116 cells to increasing doses
of oxaliplatin over successive passages as described in the
Experimental Procedures section (12). The surviving resistant
cell lines were named HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR. The proliferation rates of both HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells were
slower than those of their parental cells, HT29 and HCT116
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1), consistent with an
upregulation of cell-cycle regulator p21 (Supplementary Fig.

oxaliplatin exposure, we compared the effect of oxaliplatin on
HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells to the effect on their parental
cells by a 72-hour MTT assay (Fig. 1B). As expected, HT29-OxR
and HCT116-OxR cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic
effects of oxaliplatin compared with parental, chemona€ve
cells.
To test the cross-chemoresistance of HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR cells, we treated the resistant cells with 5-FU,
a drug with a different mechanism of action from that of
oxaliplatin, and observed cross-resistance of both cell lines to
5-FU. The chemoresistant phenotype was also reﬂected by
more than 130- and 30-fold increases in the IC50 to oxaliplatin
in the HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells, respectively, and 3and 5-fold increases in the IC50 to 5-FU (Table 1). Furthermore,

exposure of both parental and resistant cells to increasing
concentrations of oxaliplatin (0.2, 2, and 20 mmol/L) and 5-FU
(0.2, 2, and 20 mg/mL) for 24 hours induced a concentrationdependent apoptotic event in the parental cells, but not in the
resistant cells, as reﬂected by detection of PARP, caspase 3
cleavage by Western blot (Fig. 1C), and measurement of
Annexin V–binding population by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Thus, the stably selected HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR cells display a phenotype of cross-chemoresistance to both oxaliplatin and 5-FU.

Intracellular ATP in Cancer Cell Chemoresistance

which is often an indicator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity (17). Interestingly, the HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly elevated cellular
OCR, suggesting the OxR cells may produce more ATP through
upregulation of their mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(Fig. 2B).
To further determine changes in mitochondria, we examined the ultra-structure of mitochondria by transmission
electronic microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2C, the TEM
images showed 2 different patterns of alterations in the mitochondria of HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells. The morphology
of mitochondria of HT29-OxR is similar to the mitochondria of
its parental cells; however, the mitochondria of HCT116-OxR
cells are more elongated than that of its parental cells. A more
condensed mitochondrial form was observed as a common
feature in both resistant cell lines. The number of mitochondria
in HT29-OxR cells did not change but increased in HCT116OxR cells as compared with their parental cells, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
The data showing enhanced oxygen consumption and the
increased density of mitochondria in the resistant cells suggest
that the mitochondria of these cells are more active, possibly
for the purpose of generating more ATP. To test this, we
measured the ATP-producing capacity of mitochondria isolated from the parental and resistant cells using complex-I
substrates glutamate and malate and complex-II substrate
succinate. Surprisingly, the mitochondria of resistant cells
actually were signiﬁcantly less capable of producing ATP than
were their parental cells (Fig. 2D). In addition, the reserve
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity was significantly lower in the OxR cells after treatment with the uncoupler carbonilcyanide p-triﬂouromethoxyphenylhydrazone, as
measured by the Seahorse Bioenergizer, suggesting defective
mitochondrial function (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Taken
together, these data suggest that the resistant cells used an
alternative energy-producing mechanism to maintain a higher
ATP levels.
Elevated glycolysis of chemoresistant cells
To test whether the cross-chemoresistant cells also have
altered aerobic glycolysis, we measured several key glycolytic
parameters, including glucose consumption, lactate production, and expression levels of glycolytic enzymes in the resistant cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, both HT29-OxR and HCT116OxR cells consumed more glucose than their parental cells.
Accordingly, the resistant cells released more lactate into the
media (Fig. 3B). Consistently, a comprehensive glycolytic
parameter, ECAR, was signiﬁcantly higher in the OxR cells
compared with their parental cells, suggesting a higher glycolytic phenotype of the OxR cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). In
addition, the protein expression of glucose transporter (Glut-1)
and hexokinase (HK2) were all signiﬁcantly upregulated in
HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells (Fig. 3C).
A master regulator of glycolysis is HIF-1a (18), which is
regulated by oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent
mechanisms (19). We next examined HIF-1a expression and
found that HIF-1a was upregulated in both HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR cells under normoxic conditions. To further

prove a functional role of HIF-1a in the resistant cells, we
examined the expression of VEGF-A, a known downstream
gene of HIF-1a. We found several isoforms of VEGFA were
increased in the HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR conditioned
media including the VEGFA165 (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S5). Consistently, the mRNA levels of VEGFA were significantly upregulated in both resistant cell lines (Fig. 3D), suggesting a functional HIF1a pathway was elevated in the OxR
cells.
Intracellular ATP regulates HIF-1a and induces drugresistant phenotype
The higher intracellular ATP level and defective mitochondrial ATP production in the chemoresistant cells as compared
with the parental cells indicated that the resistant cells might
need more ATP to survive under genotoxic stress. It is likely
that the drug-resistant cells may turn to glycolysis for more
rapid ATP generation. It is known that the ADP/AMP ratio
determines the glycolytic rate through stereotypic regulation
of the key glycolytic enzyme PFK and drives glycolysis (20).
Therefore, we measured the levels of intracellular ADP and
AMP using HPLC-MS. As shown in Fig. 4A, the ratio of ADP/
AMP was much lower in HT29-OxR and HCT116-OxR cells than
in their parental controls. We further measured the enzyme
activity of PFK by a well-established in vitro biochemical assay
(13) over a time course of 5 to 20 minutes using extracted cell
lysates. In consistent with the decreased ADP/AMP ratio, the
PFK enzyme activity was elevated in HT29-OxR cells and to a
much higher level in HCT116-OxR cells as compared with their
parental cells (Fig. 4B).
The activity of aerobic glycolysis, level of metabolic regulator
HIF-1a, and cellular ATP level were higher in the resistant cells,
which suggest that ATP has a protective role for cancer cells
under genotoxic stress. To test this possibility, we artiﬁcially
delivered ATP packaged in liposomal vehicles to the parental
HT29 and HCT116 cells by transient transfection and examined the drug treatment effect on these cells. As shown in Fig.
4C, exogenous ATP supplementation partially blocked the
cytotoxic effect of oxaliplatin in both cell lines, indicating the
role of intracellular ATP level in mediating the drug-resistant
phenotype.
We further hypothesized that the resistant cells are in need
of more ATP; thus, a faster ATP production mechanism,
namely, aerobic glycolysis, is elevated, which in turn demands
a higher level of HIF-1a to enhance/sustain aerobic glycolysis
(Fig. 3C). To test whether exogenous ATP delivery could affect
HIF-1a level and glycolysis, we treated the resistant cells with
ATP liposomes and examined the expression levels of HIF-1a
and glycolytic enzymes. Consistent with our hypothesis, ATP
treatment decreased HIF-1a rapidly in both HT29-OxR and
HCT116-OxR cells, and reversed the glycolytic phenotype, as
evidenced by a concordant decrease in hexokinase II expression in both resistant cell lines (Fig. 4D). The level of Glut-1 was
not signiﬁcantly altered at 2 hours ATP treatment, which is
probably due to the protein turnover kinetics of Glut-1 being
different from that of hexokinase II.
If the intracellular ATP level plays a central role in sustaining
the survival of cross-chemoresistant cells, depletion of ATP

should sensitize these cells to chemotherapeutic agents. As
shown in Fig. 5A, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA), a widely used
ATP-depleting agent (21), depleted cellular ATP in HT29-OxR
and HCT116-OxR cells in a dose-dependent manner. We pretreated the resistant cells with a moderate does of 3-BrPA (30
mmol/L) for 24 hours, then tested their sensitivity to oxaliplatin
and 5-FU. As shown in Fig. 5B and C, ATP depletion partially
reversed the drug-resistant phenotype and resensitized both
resistant cell lines to oxaliplatin and 5-FU treatment. The IC50
values of oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the OxR cells before and after
ATP depletion by 3-BrPA treatment were calculated. There was
a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the IC50 in both OxR cell lines after
ATP depletion (Supplementary Table S2). Taken together,
our data suggest that intracellular ATP plays a central role

in regulation of drug-resistant phenotype of colon cancer
cells.

Discussion
ATP, the energy currency of the cell, is produced from
carbon fuels at 2 levels of metabolism, glycolysis in the cytosol
and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Glycolysis,
besides producing pyruvate for oxidative phosphorylation
under nonstressful conditions, generates 2 moles of ATP from
1 mole of glucose. In normal cells undergoing stress, for
example, due to a sudden drop of intracellular ATP and
hypoxia, cells will accelerate glycolysis to produce ATP to meet
the immediate energy need; accelerated glycolysis leads to

increased production of lactate from pyruvate (22, 23).
Although the efﬁciency of ATP production via glycolysis is
lower than that of oxidative phosphorylation, the ATP generation rate of glycolysis is nearly 100 times faster than that of
oxidative phosphorylation. In tumors, elevated aerobic glycolysis differentiates malignant tumors from benign tumors and
nontumor cells, a phenomenon that was identiﬁed by Otto
Warburg (24) and has been repeatedly conﬁrmed. One possible
driver of the aerobic glycolysis of malignant tumor cells could
be a higher ATP demand for the purposes of survival and
growth as than demand in nonmalignant or normal cells (25).
Our data support the hypothesis that metabolic shift driven by

higher ATP demand is also applicable to the progression of
acquired chemoresistance of cancer cells.
To cope with constant chemotherapeutic stress, chemoresistant cancer cells are known to do at least one of the
following: increase drug efﬂux, enhance drug inactivation,
enhance DNA damage repair, mutate survival-related genes,
deregulate growth factor signaling pathways, increase expression of antiapoptotic genes, and/or activate intracellular survival signaling (1, 4). All of these activities consume ATP. Our
data showing elevated aerobic glycolysis in the chemoresistant
cells and sensitization of the chemoresistant cells by inhibition
of glycolysis further argue that enhanced aerobic glycolysis of

cancer cells occurs to provide the extra amount of ATP needed
for chemoresistant cells to survive under stress. It is worth
noting that the chemoresistant cells consume more oxygen
while their mitochondrial ATP production is defective (Fig.
3D). Oxygen consumption has often been used as an indicator
of mitochondrial ATP productivity. Our data support the
argument that oxygen consumption is not a reliable index for
mitochondrial ATP productivity (26). The role of enhanced
oxygen consumption by chemoresistant cells warrants further
investigation.
Extracellular ATP can be taken up by cells via adenosine
transporters (27); however, because of signaling effects
triggered by adenosine receptors (28), treating cells with
naked ATP results in a complex of signaling responses
besides an increase in the intracellular ATP level. Liposome-encapsulated ATP has been used to deliver ATP into
cells in vivo (29–32), which allows us to avoid interfering
with the signaling mediated by adenosine receptors. The
comprehensive effects of delivering ATP directly into cells,
reverting the aerobic glycolytic activity and HIF-1a level of

cross-chemoresistant cells, and converting chemosensitive
cells to resistant cells, further indicate that the chemoresistant cells are in need of more ATP.
In tumor tissues, upregulation of HIF-1a cannot be fully
attributed to hypoxia. Increased expression of HIF-1a is often
found in cancer cells of tissues in which oxygen supply is
sufﬁcient (33–35), and HIF-1a is upregulated only in the
malignant tumor cells and not the benign tumor cells with
the same tissue origin (36–39). For example, glucose deprivation induces HIF-1a expression in the presence of an ample
amount of oxygen (40). Our ﬁnding of the oxygen-independent
degradation of HIF-1a induced by the increase of intracellular
ATP is novel. Although the molecular mechanism is currently
under investigation, it bears important implications for cancer
biology. The data suggest the possibility that insufﬁciency of
intracellular ATP might be a driving force of oxygen-independent HIF-1a signaling in cancer cells, which in turn elevates
aerobic glycolysis to produce ATP more efﬁciently to meet the
increased demand of cancer cells. This possibility is supported
by a recent ﬁnding that malignant tumor cells consume a

higher amount of ATP via the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme
UDPase ENTPD5, that, in turn enhances aerobic glycolysis (41).
On the basis of the contradiction between a higher amount
of ATP, HIF-1a, and glycolysis in chemoresistant cells and
downregulation of HIF-1a and glycolysis by exogenous ATP
delivery, and the chemoresistant effect of ATP on chemosensitive cells, we propose the concept of "ATP debt." ATP debt is
the extra amount of ATP needed to maintain survival homeostatic pathways in cancer cells, which is equal to ATP needed
for survival minus ATP produced. The decreased ADP/AMP
ratio and increased PFK activity in the drug-resistant cells as
compared with the parental cells indicates a higher ATP
consumption rate in the drug-resistant cells. Thus, the drugresistant cells demand a faster ATP generating mechanism to
maintain survival, which is met by aerobic glycolysis/fermentation. Under these conditions, HIF-1a, as a key glycolysis
regulator, is upregulated independent of oxygen levels. The
steady-state higher level of HIF-1a in the drug-resistant cells
and its downregulation by increased ATP levels suggests that
more ATP is needed to cope with chemotherapeutic stress, that
is, the drug-resistant cells have higher "ATP debt." The level of
HIF-1a under normoxic conditions might be an indicator of
ATP debt. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
cancer cells use to reduce their ATP debt may provide the
foundation for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
