BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy has not been reported to have a significant impact on survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. Bortezomib was shown to have additive/synergistic effects with several chemotherapeutic agents,
including paclitaxel and platinum. A phase 1 trial of this 3-drug combination reported that 6 of 28 patients treated
with bortezomib followed by paclitaxel and carboplatin achieved a partial response (including 2 of 5 patients with
metastatic melanoma). METHODS: A 2-stage phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to assess the antitumor activity of
this 3-agent combination in patients with metastatic melanoma who had received at most 1 prior chemotherapy for
metastatic disease. Treatment included bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1, 4, and 8; paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2; and carboplatin at an area under the concentration (AUC) of 6 on Day 2 of a 21-day
cycle. The primary endpoint of this trial was tumor response rate (TRR). RESULTS: Seventeen eligible patients were
enrolled. A median of 4 cycles were administered (range, 1-7 cycles). Three patients discontinued treatment due to
persistent grade 4 (based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version
3.0]) neutropenia with grade 3 leukopenia (2 patients) or grade 4 pulmonary embolism (1 patient). Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (71%), leukopenia (41%), thrombocytopenia (29%), and arthralgia (12%). Two partial
responses were observed (TRR, 11.8%). Four patients had stable disease at >12 weeks. The median progression-free
survival was 3.2 months, and the median overall survival was 7.0 months. CONCLUSIONS: Due to insufficient clinical
efficacy, this trial did not proceed to second-stage accrual. The combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bortezomib demonstrated limited clinical benefit and was associated with significant toxicity. Cancer 2010;116:3463–8.

KEYWORDS: paclitaxel, carboplatin, bortezomib, metastatic melanoma.

The limited effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches in patients with metastatic melanoma underscores the importance of developing novel agents. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a small, cell-permeable molecule that specifically and selectively inhibits proteosomes.1,2 As a single agent administered twice weekly for 2 of every 3 weeks at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2,
bortezomib did not demonstrate significant clinical activity in patients with metastatic melanoma (no objective responses;
median time to disease progression of 1.5 months).3 However, recent preclinical studies demonstrated that bortezomib
has additive/synergistic effects when combined with several chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel and platinum.4

Original Article

A phase 1 trial of bortezomib in combination with carboplatin (CBDCA) and paclitaxel (PAC) in 33 patients with
advanced solid tumors, including 5 cases of metastatic
melanoma, was reported by our group.5 Two different
administration schedules based on a 21-day treatment
cycle were tested. On Schedule A, PAC and CBDCA were
given on Day 1 followed by bortezomib on Days 2, 5, and
8; on Schedule B, bortezomib was given on Days 1, 4, and
8 with PAC and CBDCA administered on Day 2.
Thrombocytopenia was the dose-limiting toxicity for
both schedules. The proportion of patients who developed severe neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
was similar among the treatment scheduled, but 19 (68%)
of the 28 patients on Schedule B were treated at dose levels
higher than the maximally tolerated dose of Schedule A.
In addition, 6 of the 28 patients treated with Schedule B
achieved a partial response (PR) (2 patients with malignant melanoma, 3 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer,
and 1 patient with gynecologic cancer1) and only 1 of the
25 patients treated with Schedule A achieved a PR
(patient had malignant melanoma). Given these findings,
the recommended phase 2 dose schedule was Schedule B
with bortezomib administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2,
PAC at a dose of 175 mg/m2, and CBDCA at an area
under the concentration (AUC) of 6.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility Criteria
Eligible patients were age >18 years with histologic confirmation of malignant melanoma with manifestations of
metastatic disease. Patients were required to have measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2; a life expectancy >4 months; and adequate
organ function defined as follows: an absolute granulocyte
count 1500/mm3, a platelet count 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin 9.0 gm/dL, creatinine 1.5 times the upper
limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
3 times ULN, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, and a urine
dipstick for proteinuria of 1þ with a 24-hour urine protein <500 mg of proteinuria/24 hours. These patients
were enrolled from 2005 to 2007 at 7 separate cancer centers participating in our phase 2 Cancer Consortium.
Exclusion criteria included the following: known central nervous system metastases; >1 prior chemotherapy regimen; prior CBDCA, PAC, or bortezomib; history of
allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to the study agents; grade 2þ

3464

peripheral neuropathy; uncontrolled or current infection;
symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia; >2 prior immunotherapy regimens and 4 weeks since radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, or surgery; and 8 weeks since monoclonal antibody therapy. Pregnant or nursing women were not
eligible, and men and women of childbearing potential
were required to practice appropriate contraception. All
patients provided written informed consent in accordance
with institutional review board requirements.
Treatment Administration and Evaluation
A treatment cycle was 21 days in length. Patients received
bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, and 8;
PAC as a 3-hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 175 mg/
m2 on Day 2; and CBDCA as a 30-minute intravenous
infusion at a dose of AUC of 6 (Calvert calculation) on Day
2. Standard intravenous premedications for PAC and
CBDCA were administered before chemotherapy on Day 2
(ranitidine at a dose of 50 mg or cimetidine at a dose of 300
mg, dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg, and diphenhydramine at a dose of 50 mg). Patients continued to receive
treatment according to protocol specifications if there was
no evidence of excessive toxicity or progression of disease,
initiation of nonprotocol treatment, or patient request to
discontinue therapy. Toxicities (based on National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events [version 3.0] grading criteria) that prompted treatment discontinuation included grade 3þ neuromotor, neurosensory, or neurologic pain adverse events. A maximum
of 2 dose reductions were allowed for excessive toxicity. The
first dose reduction resulted in a target AUC of 4 for
CBDCA, PAC at 150 mg/m2, and bortezomib at 1.0 mg/
m2. The second resulted in a target AUC of 3 for CBDCA,
PAC at 100 mg/m2, and bortezomib at 0.7 mg/m2. If treatment was withheld due to unacceptable toxicity for >3
weeks, study treatment was not to be restarted.
Treatment was to be withheld on Day 1 of a cycle for
an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1500/mm3 or a platelet count <100,000/mm3 until counts rose above these
levels and for any grade 3þ nonhematologic, non-neurologic toxicities until severity returned to preregistration levels or grade 1. A grade 2 neurologic toxicity required
omitting bortezomib until grade 1 and then administering it at a dose reduced by 1 level. Adverse events reported
during cycle weeks 1 to 3 requiring bortezomib to be omitted for the rest of the cycle and then all 3 agents to be
administered at doses reduced by 1 level on subsequent
cycles included: febrile neutropenia, grade 3þ vomiting

not controlled by medication; ANC <1500/mm3; and a
platelet count < 100,000/mm3. Other grade 3þ nonhematologic toxicities required only PAC and CBDCA to be
administered at doses reduced by 1 level.
Not more than 14 days before registration, patients
underwent a complete physical examination, including a
brief neurologic examination, tumor evaluation, complete
blood counts (white blood cell count, ANC, hemoglobin,
and platelet count), serum chemistries (creatinine, total
and direct bilirubin, albumin, glucose, calcium, AST, lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, and sodium), and urinalysis (proteinuria and urine protein:creatinine ratio).
Physical examinations, complete blood counts, serum
chemistries, and toxicity evaluations were repeated at the
completion of each cycle of treatment until treatment was
discontinued. Tumors were evaluated using the RECIST
criteria every 6 weeks during treatment.
Trial Design and Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint of this trial was the tumor response
rate (TRR), defined as the number of eligible patients
whose disease met the RECIST criteria for complete
response (CR) or PR on 2 consecutive evaluations at least
6 weeks apart divided by the number of eligible patients
enrolled onto the trial. A Simon 2-stage phase 2 clinical
trial design was chosen to test whether the true TRR was
at most 15% against the alternative that the true TRR was
at least 35% with the significance level set at 0.10 and the
likelihood of detecting that the TTR is >15% when it is
at least 35% set at 90%. Specifically, the first stage was to
enroll 19 eligible patients and if at least 4 of these 19
patients had a confirmed tumor response, a second stage
of enrollment would be opened for an additional 14 eligible patients. If at least 8 patients of the 33 eligible patients
enrolled had a confirmed tumor response without excessive toxicity, the regimen would be considered for further
testing in this patient population.
A 90% binomial confidence interval (90% CI) for the
TRR was constructed. Progression-free survival was defined
as the time from registration to disease progression or death
without documentation of disease progression. Survival
time was defined as the time from registration to death due
to any cause. Time-to-event distributions were estimated
using the method of Kaplan and Meier.

canceled participation after signing a consent form but
before receiving any study treatment. One patient was
found to be ineligible because the patient had a proteinuria of 1þ but a 24-hour urine protein was not taken. The
criteria to open enrollment to stage II of this trial were not
met and, as such, the trial was permanently closed to
accrual. The following is a report of our findings among
these 17 eligible patients (Table 1). The median age at
enrollment was 59 years (range, 39-74 years). Nine
patients (52.9%) had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma.
Clinical Outcomes
The median number of cycles administered was 4 cycles
(total of 62 cycles; range, 1-7 cycles). Bortezomib was
omitted on Day 4 of 2 cycles (3.2%) and on Day 8 of 15
cycles (24.2%). Severe (grade 3) hematologic toxicities
led to dose reductions for 6 patients. Two patients discontinued treatment due to persistent grade 4 neutropenia
with grade 3 leukopenia requiring a third dose reduction.
One patient, after 4 cycles of treatment, developed a grade
4 pulmonary embolism and discontinued treatment. The

included neutropenia (71%), leukopenia (41%), thrombocytopenia (29%), and arthralgia (12%). Grade 2 neurosensory toxicity was observed in 1 (6.0%) patient (Table
2). At the time of last follow-up, all 17 patients had discontinued treatment. The reasons include disease progression (13 patients), refusal (1 patient), and excessive
toxicity (3 patients).
Among the 17 patients enrolled, there were 2
(11.8%; 90% CI, 2.1-32.6%) patients with a confirmed
PR. Both of these patients had had prior chemotherapy
with or without immunologic therapy. Four (23.5%)
patients had disease that remained stable for at least 12
weeks (completed at least 4 cycles of treatment with stable
disease): 1 patient had received no prior systemic therapy,
1 patient had received chemotherapy, and the other 2
patients had received immunologic therapy.
At the time of last follow-up, 3 patients were alive with
progression of disease and 14 patients had died of disease.
The median progression-free survival time was 3.2 months,
and the median survival time was 7.0 months (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
Approximately 62,480 new cases of melanoma and 8420
deaths attributable to melanoma occurred in the United
States in 2008.6 For those patients with metastatic disease,
the prognosis is very poor. The median survival of patients
with metastatic melanoma ranges between 2 and 8
months according to the site and the number of metastases. The estimated 5-year survival rate is less than 5% to
10%.7 With visceral metastases, the 2-year survival rate is
only approximately 1% to 2%.8,9 Treatment options for
patients with metastatic melanoma are limited. Surgery,
when possible, should be recommended if complete removal of all visible metastases is achievable.10,11 It can
provide quick and effective palliation and leads to longterm survival of more than 5 to 10 years in some cases.
Unfortunately, the majority of patients with metastatic
disease present with nonresectable disease and require systemic therapy. Current available systemic treatment

approaches, including cytotoxic chemotherapy and
immunotherapy, used either alone or in combination,
have limited effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no regimen that could be considered as the ‘‘standard of care’’ for metastatic melanoma. Dacarbazine is generally considered to be the most active single agent, with a
response rate of approximately 10% to 12%.12 However,
the vast majority of responses are only partial, and the median response duration is only 4 to 6 months. In addition,
responses are rare in visceral sites.13 Although dacarbazine
remains the only cytotoxic drug approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients
with metastatic melanoma, there are no phase 3 trial data
to support a survival benefit for dacarbazine compared
with a ‘‘best supportive care’’ control.14 Temozolomide is
an analog of dacarbazine that can be administered orally.
It produces response rates of 13%, which is similar to
those obtained with dacarbazine in phase 3 studies.15
Fotemustine, which is not yet available in the United
States, provides a response rate of approximately 24% in
patients with metastatic melanoma.16 For all these drugs,
CRs occur in <10% of cases and the median duration of
response is between 4 and 6 months without any survival
advantage when compared with dacarbazine.17,18
Bortezomib is an unconventional cytotoxic agent
that was recently approved for the treatment of multiple
myeloma19 and is currently undergoing testing in solid tumor patients. It has a unique pattern of activity when
screened against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines,
including melanoma.20 Bortezomib is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid derived from leucine and phenylalanine
and is currently undergoing active investigation as a novel

antineoplastic agent.21,22 Bortezomib is a potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor (Ki-0.6 nM). It also inhibits
the growth of cultured tumor cells by blocking cell division in the G2-M–phase of the cell cycle, leading to cytotoxicity by means of apoptosis, and inhibits the
degradation of the wild-type tumor suppressor protein
p53, but not mutated forms of this protein. In addition,
bortezomib stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor p21 and inhibits the activation of nuclear factor
(NF) -B through the stabilization of the inhibitor protein
I B. Bortezomib inhibits NF-B–dependent gene expression, as demonstrated by inhibition of cell surface adhesion molecule (CAM) transcription. As a consequence of
the inhibition of CAM expression, bortezomib also inhibits the adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells. Overexpression of bc1-2, an anti-apoptotic effector protein, is
inhibited by bortezomib, leading to cell death. As a single
agent, bortezomib therapy was reported to be ineffective
in patients with metastatic melanoma.3 However, it
appeared to exhibit synergistic/additive antitumor activity
with taxanes and platinum compounds, leading to successful phase 1 testing. Thus, we developed an interest in
combining bortezomib with the combination of PAC and
CBDCA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
The combination of PAC and CBDCA is a relatively
new development in metastatic melanoma, despite being
used in a broad range of solid tumors. Synergism between
platinum and PAC in preclinical studies has been established.23 To a limited extent, at the time of the design of
our current trial, the combination of PAC and CBDCA
had already been tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Results of a phase 2 trial using PAC (at a dose of
175 mg/m2) and CBDCA (at an AUC of 7.5) administered every 21 days in patients with metastatic melanoma
demonstrated that of 15 evaluable patients, 3 (20%)
achieved a PR, 7 (47%) achieved stable disease, and 5
(33%) developed disease progression.24 There were no
CRs reported. Eleven patients experienced grade 3 or 4
hematologic toxicity. The patients accrued on this study
had good performance status (0-1) with 23% of patients
exhibiting disease involving the skin, 40% the lungs, 33%
the lymph nodes, 26% the liver, and 13% other visceral
organs. The treatment was deemed ineffective as first-line
therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.
A second phase 2 trial by the German Dermatologic
Cooperative Oncology Group (DaCOG) was subsequently reported using weekly PAC and CBDCA as second-line therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.25 PAC
(at a dose of 80 mg/m2) and CBDCA (at a dose of 200

Cancer

mg/m2) were given weekly for 6 weeks of 8 as a cycle. Of
the 16 patients who received this combination therapy, 3
patients (19%) had stable disease that lasted for 16 weeks.
The trial was discontinued because the response rate was
considered too low to justify continuing the trial.
A retrospective report on the clinical use of the combination of PAC and CBDCA as second-line therapy for
patients with metastatic melanoma suggested potential
clinical benefit.26 Twenty-two of 31 reported patients
received weekly PAC at a dose of 100 mg/m2 and
CBDCA at an AUC of 2; the remainder received PAC at a
dose of 175 to 225 mg/m2 and CBDCA at an AUC of 5.
An objective PR was noted in 8 patients (26%) with an
additional 6 patients (19%) noted to have stable disease.
The median progression-free survival was 3 months with a
median overall survival of 7.8 months. The clinical benefit
in 14 patients was believed to be clinically significant
when the weekly regimen was used as second-line chemotherapy. The authors concluded that further investigation
of the combination of PAC and CBDCA in patients with
metastatic melanoma was worth pursuing because the
clinical outcomes data compared favorably with either
dacarbazine or temozolomide therapy.18
The greatest enthusiasm for the use of PAC and
CBDCA in the treatment of metastatic melanoma came after the presentation of the phase 1/2 clinical results of the
combination of PAC and CBDCA and sorafenib. The initial data suggested clinical response rates in the 50% range
with acceptable toxicity.27 These data were encouraging
enough to immediately enter development toward phase 3
clinical testing, suggesting that the combination of ‘‘small
molecules’’ with the PAC and CBDCA combination chemotherapy ‘‘backbone’’ was a reasonable approach in metastatic melanoma. Two phase 3 clinical trials randomizing
sorafenib against placebo in combination with PAC and
CBDCA using a 21-day regimen were initiated in both
chemotherapy-naive as well as previously treated patients,
respectively. The results of the phase 3 trial in previously
treated patients with metastatic melanoma were recently
reported.28 A total of 270 patients were randomized to
receive either the 2-drug (PAC and CBDCA) versus the 3drug regimen (PAC and CBDCA at doses of 7.25 mg/
m2and an AUC of 6, respectively, with or without sorafenib
at a dose of 400 mg twice daily on Days 2-19). This trial
concluded that the addition of sorafenib to the combination
of PAC and CBDCA did not improve progression-free survival or objective response rates as second-line therapy, failing to reproduce the original phase 1/2 data. Toxicities were
tolerable. The same regimen is currently completing testing

3467

in chemotherapy-naive patients (E2603). In the least, the 2
cited phase 3 clinical trials have reinforced the notion of the
clinical utility of the combination of PAC and CBDCA in
the management of metastatic melanoma, now with phase
3 data comparing favorably with results obtained with conventional dacarbazine or temozolomide. We eagerly await
the results of E3603.
In summary, bortezomib as a single agent or in combination with PAC and CBDCA lacks sufficient clinical
activity in patients with metastatic melanoma to warrant
further investigation.
