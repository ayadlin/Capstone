ABSTRACT
To clarify the association between carboplatin and electrolyte abnormality, a
pooled-analysis was performed with the adverse event reports of non-small cell lung
cancer patients. A total of 19901 adverse events were retrieved from the FDA Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS). Pooled reporting odds ratios (RORs) and 95% CIs
suggested that carboplatin was significantly associated with hyponatremia (pooled
ROR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.18–2.09, P = 1.99×10-3) and hypokalemia (pooled ROR = 2.37,
95% CI 1.80–3.10, P = 5.24×10-10) as compared to other therapies. In addition, we
found that dehydration was frequently concurrent with carboplatin therapy (pooled
ROR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.52–2.66, P = 8.37×10-7), which may prompt excessive water
ingestion and decrease serum electrolyte concentrations. This information has not been
mentioned in the FDA-approved drug label and could help explain the physiological
mechanism of carboplatin-induced electrolyte abnormality. In conclusion, the above
results will facilitate clinical management and prompt intervention of life-threatening
electrolyte imbalance in the course of cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

with negative consequences regarding morbidity and
mortality [3, 4]. In the course of treatment with specific
drugs, electrolyte abnormality may develop either
symptomatically or asymptomatically [5]. Since it is
difficult for clinicians to pay constant attention to drug
reactions, drug-induced electrolyte abnormality may
be underdiagnosed in some cases. Therefore, thorough
awareness of the adverse effects of certain drugs on
serum sodium and potassium levels is of great importance
for effective prevention of potentially life-threatening
electrolyte disturbance.

Drug-induced electrolyte abnormality has
been widely observed in hospitalized patients [1, 2].
Hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium concentration
lower than 135 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (defined as
serum potassium concentration lower than 3.5 mmol/L)
are two of the most common forms of electrolyte
abnormality. In clinical practice, electrolyte abnormality
is found to cause various symptoms and to be associated

Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug broadly used
against a variety of cancers, such as non-small cell
lung cancer [6]. As a platinum-based antineoplastic
agent interfering with DNA repair, carboplatin gained
increasing acceptance in clinical treatment due to greatly
reduced toxicity profile compared to its parent compound
cisplatin [7, 8]. However, in recent years, isolated events
of hyponatremia and hypokalemia following carboplatin
administration have been reported [9, 10]. Therefore,
analysis based on larger samples is necessary to confirm
the potential risks of carboplatin. However, obtaining and
interpreting large-scale data has always been a challenge
in clinical studies [11].
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
is a pharmacovigilance system established by US FDA
for the purpose of monitoring the safety of approved
drug products. Adverse events of various drugs were
continuously submitted by healthcare professionals and
consumers to FAERS on a voluntary basis. Each case
report provides various clinical information, such as the
drugs used and the adverse reactions reported by the
patient. Over these years, FAERS supported not only
the drug safety surveillance of FDA, but also academic
research about drug safety and development [12-15].
In view of the increasingly extensive application of
FAERS data, the openFDA initiative (https://open.fda.
gov/) was launched in June 2014 to provide convenient
and computer-readable information of adverse events
[16]. With openFDA, researchers were enabled to
efficiently download and preprocess the FAERS data, so

as to examine the association between drugs and adverse
reactions.
In this analysis, we pooled adverse event reports
submitted by non-small cell lung cancer patients
to FAERS from 2004 to 2015. By comparing the
patients exposed to carboplatin and other drugs, we
examined whether hyponatremia and hypokalemia were
significantly more concurrent with carboplatin therapy,
so as to understand the effects of carboplatin on serum
electrolyte levels. In addition, we explored the association
between carboplatin and dehydration, which indicated the
potential physiological mechanism of carboplatin-induced
electrolyte abnormality.

RESULTS
Pooled analysis of hyponatremia adverse events
The pooled analysis on hyponatremia involved a
total of 19901 adverse event reports (see Materials and
Methods), among which 3907 reports (19.63%) were
related to patients exposed to carboplatin. The χ2-based Q
test [17] indicated no significant heterogeneity underlying
the FAERS reports of different years (P = 0.37, I2 = 8%),
so a fixed-effects model was selected to estimate the
weighted average of effect size. The pooled reporting odds
ratio (ROR) [18] proved to be significantly higher than
1.00 (Figure 1), suggesting that carboplatin therapy was

associated with hyponatremia among non-small cell lung
cancer patients (pooled ROR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.18-2.09,
P = 1.99×10-3). There was no evidence of reporting bias
in the above results, since the Egger’s test [19] validated

= 0.23).

disorder of water homeostasis, may develop most often
with impaired capability of the kidney to excrete free
water [20] or excessive intake of water [21]. Therefore,
we further examined the effects of carboplatin on renal
function and water ingestion. On one hand, a fixedeffects meta-analysis (χ2-based Q test P = 0.41, I2 = 3%)
indicated a non-significant association between carboplatin
and impaired renal function (Figure 3, pooled ROR = 1.17,
95% CI 0.69-1.96). On the other hand, a random-effects
meta-analysis (χ2-based Q test P = 1.09×10-5, I2 = 74%)
demonstrated that carboplatin was significantly associated
with dehydration (Figure 4, pooled ROR = 2.01, 95% CI
1.52-2.66, P = 8.37×10-7). And no reporting bias was
found with regard to such an association (Supplementary
Figure 3, Egger’s test P = 0.22). These results suggested
that carboplatin-induced dehydration may trigger strong
sensation of thirst and naturally prompt overdrinking. In
consequence, the electrolytes in body will be diluted by
excess water.

Pooled analysis of hypokalemia adverse events
The FAERS reports were also analyzed for
hypokalemia adverse events. No significant heterogeneity
between different years was detected with the χ2-based
Q test (P = 0.27, I2 = 18%), so a fixed-effects model
was selected to pool the data. Combining effect sizes
of different years as an outcome lead to a pooled ROR
significantly higher than 1.00 (Figure 2), indicating the
association between carboplatin therapy and hyponatremia
(pooled ROR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.80-3.10, P = 5.24×10-10).
No significant reporting bias was observed with Egger’s
test, namely, the shape of funnel plot did not show evident
asymmetry (Supplementary Figure 2, P = 0.36).

DISCUSSION
Although multiple disease states may contribute
to the development of electrolyte disorders, various
drugs have also been proved to interfere with the
homeostasis of electrolytes [22-24]. As a class of severe
and life-threatening reactions, drug-induced electrolyte
abnormality is characterized by considerable morbidity
and mortality [25], which may pose challenges to the
clinicians who are not familiar with it. Strategies to

Physiological mechanism of carboplatin-induced
electrolyte abnormality
The above analysis on adverse events demonstrated
the risk of carboplatin-induced electrolyte imbalance, but
may not explain the underlying physiological mechanism.
It is widely recognized that electrolyte abnormality, as a

address this issue involve careful consideration of risk
factors during the process of treatment. In particular, early
awareness of the adverse effects of certain drug products
on serum electrolyte concentrations will facilitate a
rational clinical management of cancer patients.

Carboplatin is becoming commonly used as an
anti-cancer agent and increasingly noticed for potential
safety risks. As an example, the association between
carboplatin and electrolyte abnormality has been detected
in clinical trials with limited samples and individual case

reports. However, due to the lack of large-scale data of
drug adverse events, the true incidence of electrolyte
abnormality among general population exposed to
carboplatin has yet to be clear. Therefore, in the present
study, we retrieved 19901 reports of non-small cell
lung cancer patients from FAERS. Compared to other
therapies, carboplatin was significantly associated with
hyponatremia and hypokalemia. In this case, the serum
electrolyte concentrations of patients receiving carboplatin
therapy should be continuously monitored for safety.
In addition to the above findings, the underlying
physiological mechanism of carboplatin-induced
electrolyte imbalance was also explored. We hypothesized
that carboplatin may affect either normal renal function
or water ingestion. First of all, we found that carboplatin
was not likely to impair renal function. This result was
consistent with the information in the FDA-approved
drug label of carboplatin that “development of abnormal
renal function test results is uncommon” among patients
receiving carboplatin [26]. On the other hand, the FAERS
reports pointed to the significant association between
carboplatin and dehydration. It is common sense that
water balance in human body is maintained via thirst [27].
Carboplatin-induced dehydration can enhance the thirst
perception, which may lead to rapid and excessive drinking
[28]. As a result, the serum electrolyte concentrations
will be diluted by excess water [29, 30]. Therefore, in
the course of carboplatin therapy, water ingestion should
be controlled to avoid serious overhydration. Since
this information has not been mentioned in the FDAapproved drug label of carboplatin, our results provided
important references for clinicians to improve the clinical
management of non-small cell lung cancer.
In spite of the rich information provided by FAERS
reports, some limitations of current results need to be
kept in mind and addressed in subsequent research.
First, although FAERS reports indicate that carboplatin
is associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia and
dehydration, such associations should be interpreted
as cause-and-effect with caution. More clinical and
toxicological research will be required to make a stronger
argument for a cause-and-effect relationship and avoid
false positive results. Second, since all FAERS reports
are spontaneously submitted, the integrity of the data may
not be fully warranted. As a result, detailed information
about drug dosage is missing in many reports. It has
been reported that a higher daily dose is proved to be a
significant risk factor for drug toxicity [31]. Therefore,
we expect further clinical studies to be conducted to
investigate how the dosage factor may influence the risk of
electrolyte abnormality. Third, besides non-small cell lung
cancer, carboplatin is also widely used to treat other types
of cancer, such as ovarian cancer [32] and bladder cancer
[33]. Given the adverse effects encountered by non-small
cell lung cancer patients, we suggest that more studies
should be performed in different pathological conditions.

To our best knowledge, this is the first
pharmacovigilance data analysis regarding carboplatininduced electrolyte abnormality. In conclusion, both
hyponatremia and hypokalemia were found to be
significantly associated with carboplatin. In addition,
excessive intake of water after carboplatin-induced
dehydration may be an important factor affecting serum
electrolyte levels. Such information will facilitate clinical
management and prompt intervention of life-threatening
electrolyte imbalance in the course of cancer treatment.
Subsequent cohort studies and intensive toxicological
experiments remain necessary to confirm and update our
results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Raw data extraction
The original adverse events restored in FAERS
were queried through openFDA platform according to the
official tutorial (https://open.fda.gov/api/reference/). A
total of 19901 adverse events of non-small cell lung cancer
patients submitted between 2004 and 2015 were specified
with the drug indication term “NON-SMALL CELL
LUNG CANCER”. These data were retrieved by two
independent researchers, reviewed by a third researcher,
and finalized by the whole research team. Among these
adverse events, those related to carboplatin were specified
with the drug generic name “CARBOPLATIN”. And the
adverse events of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, impaired
renal function and dehydration were specified using the
terms “HYPONATRAEMIA”, “HYPOKALAEMIA”,
“RENAL IMPAIRMENT” and “DEHYDRATION”,
respectively. All the above terms were coded using
MedDRA terminology (http://www.meddra.org/).

Statistical analysis
The adverse events of each year between 2004 and
2015 were used to construct a two-by-two contingency
table as shown below, in which subjects were classified
by carboplatin exposure (exposed or not exposed) and
adverse reaction of interest (reported or not reported).
The comparison between carboplatin and other drugs in
the two-by-two table was summarized by the reporting
odds ratio (ROR), which was calculated as (n11 × n00)/(n10
× n01). An ROR greater than 1.00 indicated a higher risk
of carboplatin relative to other therapies for non-small cell
lung cancer.

patients. Annals of oncology. 2003; 14:449-454.

Then, the RORs of different years were pooled
together along with the corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs), so as to estimate the overall risk of
carboplatin. Such a meta-analysis was conducted and
visualized using ‘metafor’ package (https://cran.r-project.
org/web/packages/metafor/) of R software. Heterogeneity
of different years was examined with the χ2-based Q test,
and P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. I2 statistics
was calculated as the proportion of total heterogeneity
contributed by between-year variation. A random-effects
model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) was selected
to pool the data if significant heterogeneity was observed.
Otherwise, a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel
method) was selected.
In case of bias that may be introduced in the
process of reporting adverse events and combining data
of individual years, we used the funnel plot to assess the
validity of meta-analysis. The asymmetry of funnel plot
was examined by the method of Egger’s linear regression
test. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically
significant reporting bias.
