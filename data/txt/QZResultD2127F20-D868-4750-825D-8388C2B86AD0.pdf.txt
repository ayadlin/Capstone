ABSTRACT:
Docetaxel is used as a standard treatment in patients with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer. However, a large subset of patients develops resistance.
Understanding resistance mechanisms, which are largely unknown, will allow
identification of predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We established
resistant IGR-CaP1 prostate cancer cell lines for different doses of Docetaxel. We
investigated gene expression profiles by microarray analyses in these cell lines
and generated a signature of 99 highly differentially expressed genes potentially
implicated in chemoresistance. We focused on the role of the cell cycle regulator
LZTS1, which was under-expressed in the Docetaxel-resistant cell lines, its inhibition
resulting from the promoter methylation. Knockdown of LZTS1 in parental cells with
siRNA showed that LZTS1 plays a role in the acquisition of the resistant phenotype.
Furthermore, we observed that targeting CDC25C, a partner of LZTS1, with the
NSC663284 inhibitor specifically killed the Docetaxel-resistant cells. To further
investigate the role of CDC25C, we used inhibitors of the mitotic kinases that regulate
CDC25C. Inhibition of CHEK1 and PLK1 induced growth arrest and cell death in the
resistant cells. Our findings identify an important role of LZTS1 through its regulation
of Cdc25C in Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer and suggest that CDC25C, or the
mitotic kinases CHEK1 and PLK1, could be efficient therapeutic targets to overcome
Docetaxel resistance

INTRODUCTION

of overall survival [1,2] and it is until now the standard in
first-line chemotherapy in CRPC. Docetaxel, a member
of the taxane family, inhibits microtubules dynamics
which triggers a G2/M cell cycle arrest of tumor cells,
and induces apoptosis [3]. However, despite the survival
benefit provided by this molecule, about half of patients
develop drug resistance.
A pivotal strategy for the development of new
drugs relies on the elucidation of resistance mechanisms
and the identification of biological markers of response

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent
malignancies affecting men worldwide. It is the most
frequent cancer in the United-States and Western countries
and is a major cause of cancer death and morbidity. In
the past few years, clinical studies have highlighted the
value of chemotherapy in metastatic PCa. Docetaxelbased chemotherapy benefit in castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) was demonstrated in 2004 with an increase

to Docetaxel to select patients who will benefit from
taxane-based chemotherapy. Several studies highlighted
the complex combination of gene expression enabling
resistance to Docetaxel [4–6]. Domingo-Domenech
et al. [7] showed that targeting Notch and HedgeHog
pathways killed Docetaxel resistant cells using in vivo and
in vitro models; Puhr et al. [8] showed that resistance is
caused by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and loss
of expression of miR-200c while miR-200b reverses
Docetaxel resistance in lung adenocarcinoma [9].
We focused on the molecular mechanisms of
Docetaxel resistance to identify relevant therapeutic
targets to overcome this resistance. We developed a
series of Docetaxel-resistant derivatives of the androgenindependent PCa cell line IGR-CaP1 [10] and performed
a broad gene expression profiling using cDNA microarray
analysis. We focused our efforts on the cell cycle
regulator Lzts1, which is downregulated in our resistant
model. The LZTS1 gene was previously described as a
tumor suppressor [11] and chromosomal deletions on
chromosome 8p encompassing LZTS1 are frequently
observed in a variety of human cancers [12–16] including
prostate cancer [17]. Lzts1 is a regulator of mitosis by
maintaining high levels of CDC25C and Cdk1 activity
to prevent chromosomes missegregation [18]. Indeed,
Lzts1 knockout results in accelerated mitotic progression,
improper chromosome segregation and predisposes
mice to cancer [18]. CDC25C plays an important role in
mitosis by dephosphorylating CDK1 and allowing entry
into mitosis. CDC25C is regulated by the checkpoint
kinase 1 (CHK1), which phosphorylates S216 and
inactivates CDC25C, and by the Polo-like Kinase 1 (Plk1),
which activates CDC25C by phosphorylating S198 and
subsequently triggering activation of the CDK1/Cyclin B1
complex [19].
We used a siRNA knock-down strategy and a
CDC25C inhibitor to investigate the role of Lzts1 and
CDC25C in resistance to Docetaxel of IGR-CaP1 cells.
To further demonstrate the role of CDC25C, we used
pharmacological inhibitors of PLK1 and CHK1, in our
LZTS1-deficient Docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.

increasing doses of Docetaxel. The IC50 value for the
resistant cells increased from 24nM for IGR-CaP1-R5
cells to 148nM for IGR-CaP1-R100 compared to 0.34nM
in parental cells, thus showing a ~400 fold higher level
of Docetaxel resistance in IGR-CaP1-R100 compared
to parental cells (Fig. 1A). The resistance of cells was
confirmed by cell cycle analysis showing that, contrarily
to IGR-CaP1, IGR-CaP1-R100 cells were not blocked in
the G2/M phase (Fig. 1B). In IGR-CaP1 cells, Docetaxel
induced cell death via mitotic catastrophe evidenced by
profound multinucleation, polycentrosome and formation
of giant cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, in all the IGRCaP1-R subclones, Docetaxel resistance was maintained
in the presence of drug without inducing multinucleation,
cell death, and a polycentrosome phenotype (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that resistant cells have been able to generate
mononucleated descendants by asymmetric cell division
[20]. The IGR-CaP1-R100 cells grew more slowly than
the parental cells (Fig. S1A), their growth rate being ~2
fold higher than that of the parental cells. Whereas cell

To generate a framework for studies of Docetaxel

-R100 and R200 respectively) of the IGR-CaP1 cell
line [10], by periodically exposing proliferating cells
to increasing doses of Docetaxel. Drug response of the

LZTS1 is down-regulated in resistant cells with
a fold change of -6.0. We observed a high reduction in
LZTS1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR in all the IGR-CaP1-R
cells (80% of reduction) (Fig. 2A), which was correlated
to a complete loss of protein expression (Fig. 2B). LZTS1
down-regulation was still observed at a 100nM-Docetaxel
treatment for 48h (Fig. 2C) whereas Docetaxel had no
effect on the expression levels of LZTS1 in the parental
IGR-CaP-1 cells. Therefore, loss of expression of LZTS1
seemed to correlate with the resistance phenotype in IGRCaP1-R100 cells. Previous studies reported that LZTS1
is frequently down-regulated in several solid tumors [12–
15], and hypermethylation of a CpG island in the LZTS1
promoter is frequently observed in cell lines and tumors
which could be responsible for the reduced expression of
LZTS1 in breast cancer cells [12]. To test this hypothesis,
we analyzed promoter methylation of LZTS1 in parental
and resistant IGR-CaP1 cells. We found a high increase
in methylation levels on 20 CpGs located on the 5’ region
1 encompassing the non-coding exon 1 in resistant cells
compared to parental ones (Fig. 2D and Table SII) but
no difference in the methylation status in the second
exon surrounding the transcription start site (region 2)
as previously described [12]. These results suggest that
loss of LZTS1 expression in the Docetaxel-resistant cells
results from methylation of its promoter.

survival assays showed that all IGR-CaP1 cells died after
a 12nM-treatment with Docetaxel, IGR-CaP1-R100 cells
were able to form colonies in the presence of Docetaxel
(Fig. S1B).

Inhibition of LZTS1 gene expression in Docetaxelresistant IGR-CaP1-R cells
Microarray analysis was performed to compare
expression profiles of genes in the six Docetaxel-resistant
IGR-CaP1-R cell lines with parental cells. This analysis
led to the identification of 244 probes associated with a
resistant phenotype to all concentrations of Docetaxel
(2D clustering with p-value<10-10, fold change >2). In
this signature, 99 genes were strongly differentially
expressed (fold change >5) in the resistant cells (Table
SI). Validation of microarray data was confirmed by
real-time qRT-PCR on 17 genes (Fig. S2). Based on the
literature and Ingenuity® Pathways analysis, we identified
multiple pathways in our signature, highlighting the
complex mechanisms mediating resistance to Docetaxel.
We focused on cell cycle regulation and one of the genes,
LZTS1, which has previously been described as a tumor
suppressor and a cell cycle regulator [21], and investigated
its functional role in the mechanisms of Docetaxel
resistance.

sequence encoding exon 1 (601-824), region 2 encompasses the sequence encoding the exon 2 (49284-49727). Comparison of the mean
methylation identified at 20 CpGs in region 1 and at 32 CpGs in region 2 was shown in parental IGR-CaP1 cells (S) and in Docetaxelresistant (R100) cells.

Lzts1 down-regulation enhances Docetaxelresistance of IGR-CaP1 cells

in absence of LZTS1 (Fig. 3E). Together, these results
showed that silencing of LZTS1 in parental IGR-CaP1
cells led to survival advantage, suggesting that LZTS1 is
implicated in Docetaxel resistance.

The functional role of Lzts1 in Docetaxel resistance
was assessed in the parental IGR-CaP1 cells, using
LZTS1-specific siRNA to mimic the loss of LZTS1
observed in the resistant cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, Lzts1
expression was entirely knocked down 48h after siLZTS1
transfection. Interestingly, growth curves showed that
siLZTS1-transfected cells proliferated slightly more
than the non-target siRNA-transfected cells (siNT) (Fig.
3B) with 12nM Docetaxel conditions, suggesting that
LZTS1 extinction confers a growth advantage [22]. In a
foci formation assay, the number of clones was similar in
siLZTS1- compared to siNT-transfected cells in untreated
cells, however, after a 12nM Docetaxel treatment, we still
observed clones in siLZTS1-transfected cells (n=3.7 ±1.5)
(Fig. 3C) whereas no clones were observed in control cells.
Flow cytometry analyses showed that in LZTS1-knocked
down cells, 100nM of Docetaxel led to a reduction in
the G2/M blockage and an accumulation of cells in G1
(Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the number of polynucleated
cells observed after treatment was significantly decreased

Role of the phosphatase CDC25C in the Docetaxel
resistance mechanisms
During mitosis, LZTS1 binds the Cdk1 phosphatase
CDC25C, which is then stabilized and protected from
proteasomal degradation [18]. Partial or complete loss
of LZTS1 downregulates CDC25C and inhibits Cdk1
activity, leading to premature transition from metaphase
to anaphase. We analyzed CDC25C expression levels in
LZTS1-knocked down IGR-CaP1 and in LZTS1-deficient
IGR-CaP1-R100 cells. As shown in Fig.-4A, knockdown of LZTS1 in IGR-CaP1 cells induced a decrease
in CDC25C and a decrease of CDC25C expression
was also observed in IGR-CaP1-R100 cells (Fig. 4B).
Noticeably, Cdc25A and Cdc25B phosphatases were also
down-regulated in resistant cells. We further showed in
IGR-CaP1 cells by co-immunoprecipitation that CDC25C
interacts with LZTS1, as previously shown by Vecchione

et al. [18] in 293 cells (Fig. 4C).
To further investigate the role of CDC25C in
resistant cells, we treated IGR-CaP1 cells with the
cdc25 phosphatases inhibitor NSC663284 [23,24]. Flow
cytometry analysis showed that IGR-CaP1-R100 cells
were much more sensitive to NSC663284, showing a
massive cell death in NSC663284-treated cells (89%)
compared to 3% in parental cells (Fig. 4D). The strong
cytotoxic effect of NSC663284 on Docetaxel-resistant
cells was confirmed by the NSC663284 dose-response
curves which showed a ~33 fold lower IC50 in the
IGR-CaP1-R100 cells compared to the parental cells
(IC50=0.2µM vs 6.59µM) (Fig. 4E). Altogether, these
results suggest that CDC25C plays a role in Docetaxel
resistance and that CDC25C might be a therapeutic target
to overcome Docetaxel resistance.

CDC25C. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of
targeting the protein kinases that interact directly with
CDC25C at the G2/M phase, PLK1 and CHEK1.
PLK1 activates CDC25C and Cyclin B1 by
phosphorylation, which triggers entry of cells into mitosis,
[25]. Interestingly, PLK1 and CDC25C are overexpressed
in prostate cancer [26,27], and PLK1 expression correlates
with high tumor grades [28]. We thus investigated the
ability of several PLK1 inhibitors currently in clinical
trials to induce apoptosis in the Docetaxel-resistant cells.
We assessed the effects of three different PLK1 inhibitors
[25], BI2536, BI6727 or TAK-960, on cell proliferation of
parental and resistant IGR-CaP1 cells. BI6727 and TAK960 reduced cell proliferation (data not shown) whereas
BI2536 induced growth arrest in both parental (Fig. S3A)
and resistant cells (Fig. 5A) when used alone and in
combination with Docetaxel. To further study the effects
of BI2536 on cell growth, we performed colony formation
assays. Inhibition of PLK1 with BI2536 alone or with
Docetaxel (Fig. 5B) strongly decreased the formation of
colonies in resistant cells and abrogated colony formation
in IGR-CaP1 cells (Fig. S3B). Targeting PLK1 has

been shown to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
after radiation [29], therefore we investigated whether
BI2536 could trigger apoptosis in our model. Annexin V
stainings showed that PLK1 inhibition induced apoptosis
in the Docetaxel-resistant cells (up to 30%) (Fig. 5C)
and in the parental IGR-CaP1 cells (Fig. S3C), and was
significant both with BI2536 alone and in combination
with Docetaxel. As shown in Fig. 5D, BI2536-treated
cells displayed cleaved PARP and Caspase-3 confirming

cells to CHIR-124 after a 48hr-treatment. CHIR-124
impaired cell growth of resistant cells starting at 100nM
but had no effect on IGR-CaP1 cells. We next investigated
cell proliferation in the presence of 100nM CHIR-124
during 4 days, alone or with Docetaxel (Fig. 6B). CHIR124 alone caused cell growth arrest until day 3 when cells
started growing again. In contrast, cell proliferation was
abolished when treated with Docetaxel and CHIR-124
at day 4. This effect was more pronounced in Docetaxelresistant cells with a significant 30% decrease in survival
than in the parental cells (16%) (Fig. S4A and S4B).
Importantly, CHIR-124 treatment alone highly decreased
the ability of cells to form colonies (83% decrease in
parental cells vs 89% in resistant cells) and it totally
abolished the ability of Docetaxel-resistant cells to form
colonies when used in combination with Docetaxel
(Fig. 6C). We next determined if CHIR-124 triggered
apoptosis in our cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, CHIR-124
induced apoptosis in both parental and resistant cells and
the combination with Docetaxel slightly increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis was confirmed by
immunoblotting showing PARP-1 and Caspase-3 cleavage

of the Docetaxel-resistant cells.

based chemotherapy such as Docetaxel has previously
been shown to occur in part through perturbation of
the cell cycle and mitotic checkpoints [4] by disrupting
microtubules depolymerization leading to cell death.
In our study, we report that LZTS1 is inhibited by
methylation of its promoter in the resistant IGR-CaP1-R
cells. Importantly, LZTS1 is present on chromosome 8p,
and in many cancers, deletion of chromosome 8p12-22 or
DNA hypermethylation of this region are associated with
a more aggressive tumor phenotype, tumor progression
and more rapid appearance of metastases [12–15]. We
demonstrated that reducing LZTS1 expression levels with
specific siRNA in the parental IGR-CaP1 cells allows
the survival of several clones after Docetaxel treatment.
This provides compelling evidence that loss of LZTS1
expression is likely to be involved in Docetaxel resistance.
LZTS1 has been shown to function as a mitotic regulator
via its interaction with the mitotic kinase Cdk1 in the
G2/M phase of the cell cycle [18] and its regulation of the
CDK1 phosphatase CDC25C. Anti-sense oligonucleotides
against LZTS1 reduce active cdk1 levels, which indicates
that LZTS1 may stabilize the Cdk1–cyclinB1 complex in
G2/M. In this case, inactivation of LZTS1 leads to early
exit from mitosis and reduced control of proliferation
[21]. Furthermore, MEFs lacking LZTS1 display
enhanced mitotic degradation of CDC25C, impaired

DISCUSSION
Docetaxel consistently improves survival of
metastatic CRPC but resistance eventually occurs and
the search for predictive biomarkers to select patients
responding to the drug has been disappointing. A greater
understanding of resistance pathways is needed to both
predict resistance early in the course of treatment and
to ultimately overcome this resistance and improve
outcome. In the era of personalized cancer therapy,
signiﬁcant treatment advances have occurred through
a better understanding of drug resistance and molecular
heterogeneity among patients with the same disease.
To elucidate mechanisms of resistance to Docetaxel
and to potentially identify new therapeutic targets, we
established Docetaxel-resistant cells from the IGR-CaP1
cell line [10]. Comparison of transcript profiles between
Docetaxel-resistant IGR-CaP1-R and parental cell lines
revealed a robust modification in the transcription level
of 99 genes. Among these genes, we identified the cell
cycle regulator LZTS1. The cytotoxicity of taxane-

Cdk1 activation, accelerated mitotic progression and
chromosomal instability [18]. Therefore, we suggest that,
in absence of LZTS1 expression, tumor cells are able to
bypass the checkpoint, are not arrested in mitosis and do
not show features of mitotic catastrophe (Fig. 3D and 3E),
suggesting that targeting the checkpoint might provide a
mean to induce apoptosis in resistant cells.
Microarray data analysis show that many genes and
pathways are involved in docetaxel resistance highlighting
the complexity of chemoresistance mechanisms, as
evidenced by our results and observations made by others
[5,7,33]. We report that LZTS1 depletion partially confers
Docetaxel resistance by down-regulating CDC25C.
CDC25C belongs to a family of three conserved dual
specificity phosphatases, CDC25A, CDC25B, CDC25C,
which regulate cyclin-dependent kinases. CDC25C is
overexpressed in PCa in its non-phosphorylated active
form [26,34], however, no studies have reported thus
far any role for CDC25C in resistance to Docetaxel. In
this study, we show that inhibition of CDC25C with a
pharmacological inhibitor has a strong cytotoxic effect
on Docetaxel-resistant cells, which was not observed
in Docetaxel-sensitive counterparts suggesting that
CDC25C might be a therapeutic target to overcome
Docetaxel resistance. However, the NSC663284 inhibitor,
which we used in our experiments, has also the ability
to inhibit Cdc25A and Cdc25B, and we cannot exclude
that these isoforms are also targeted. Moreover, CDC25C
has not been druggable so far and specific inhibitors and
in vivo active molecules have not yet been developed
[35]. Our results suggest that in absence of LZTS1
expression, targeting CDC25C could very efficiently kill
resistant cells, but because of these caveats, we decided
to investigate if targeting the mitotic kinases regulating
CDC25C, PLK1 and CHK1, could be the proper approach
to overcome Docetaxel resistance in our LZTS1-deficient
cells.
CHEK1 phosphorylates CDC25C at S216 leading
to its inactivation and PLK1 phosphorylates CDC25C
at S198, which leads to its nuclear translocation and
activation of CDK1. The implication of PLK1 in
Docetaxel resistance was indeed recently shown in lung
adenocarcinoma cells [36]. Targeting of PLK1 using
the BI2536 inhibitor in combination with conventional
chemotherapy was recently shown to impair tumor
growth in vivo in two xenografts models established
from biopsies of triple negative breast cancer patients
[37]. In prostate cancer cells, inhibition of PLK1 with
BI2536 significantly potentiated paclitaxel-mediated
cell death [38] while combination of BI2536 or BI6727
with histone deacetylases had antitumor effects in
vitro [39]. Targeted inhibition of PLK1 causes mitotic
catastrophe and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells. Additionally, PLK1 is overexpressed in prostate
tumors and its expression is correlated to higher tumor
grades [28] suggesting that PLK1 might be a potential
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapeutic target for prostate cancer [29,40]. Currently,
PLK1 inhibitors are being evaluated in registered clinical
trials, namely volasertib (BI-6727) which was reported to
have clinical response and TAK-960, which possesses the
highest specificity towards PLK1, and inhibits the growth
of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo independently of MDR1
expression [41]. In our model, all PLK1 inhibitors worked
in terms of cell growth arrest and apoptosis induction,
but BI2536 gave the best results on cell growth arrest,
as evidenced by the cell proliferation curves and the
formation of colonies (Fig. 5A and 5B).
CHEK1 inhibitors have been tested with classical
chemotherapeutic agents in other solid tumors and CHEK1
is considered a good target to increase the therapeutic
effectiveness of anticancer agents [42]. Several chek1
inhibitors have been used in clinical trials in advanced
solid tumors such as LY2603618 [43–45]. In particular,
sensitization to Docetaxel with CHEK1 antagonist PF004477736 has been observed in colon and breast cancer
xenografts [46]. In our model, LY2603618 had only a
slight effect on the resistant cells (data not shown), so we
used another CHEK1 specific inhibitor, CHIR-124 [32].
We show that it induces apoptosis and cell growth arrest in
the resistant cells. We also observed a potentiating effect
of the combination of CHEK1 inhibitor with Docetaxel
which was more pronounced in the Docetaxel-resistant
cells. In our model, CHEK1 inhibitors are more efficient
to induce cell growth arrest than the PLK1 inhibitors (Fig.
5B and 6C).
Overall, our results show a stronger effect of both
CHK1 and PLK1 inhibitors in combination with Docetaxel
in resistant cells and this potentiating effect may be due to
targeting the mitotic checkpoint which is bypassed when
LZTS1 is inhibited. We also show that indirectly targeting
CDC25C with inhibitors of CHK1 and PLK1 provides a
mean to overcome chemoresistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, selection of Docetaxel-resistant
clones and reagents
The IGR-CaP1 cell line was maintained in
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Docetaxel-resistant clones were selected by exposing cells
to Docetaxel in a dose-escalation manner as described
[33]. Surviving clones to low dose of Docetaxel were
subsequently subjected to 5nM, 12nM, 25nM, 50nM,
100nM and 200nM of Docetaxel. Cells freely dividing in
each dose of Docetaxel-containing media were considered
resistant. Docetaxel (TAXOTERE®) was kindly provided
by Sanofi-Aventis (France). NSC663284 was purchased
from Calbiochem; BI2536 and CHIR-124 were purchased
from Selleckchem and were resuspended in DMSO. Anti674

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

LZTS1 (C-20), and anti-CDC25C (C-20) were obtained
from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Cdc25a, antiCdc25b, from Cell Signalling, anti-GAPDH and anti-βactin from Sigma.

Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the
ABI Prism7900 System (Applied Biosystems - Life
Technologies, Saint-Aubin, France) as described [10]
with PCR primers for LZTS1 (Hs00232762_m1) (Applied
Biosystems). The ∆∆CT method was used to quantify
transcripts.

Cell Cycle analysis
Cell cycle was determined using propidium iodide
(PI) staining. Briefly, parental and Docetaxel-resistant
cells were treated or not with Docetaxel for 48h and
cells were collected by trypsinization. After staining with
PI, cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Le Pont-De-Claix, France).

Genomic DNA extraction and bisulphite modification
One microgram of genomic DNA isolated using the
QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) was bisulfite-modified
using CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Chemicon).
DNA CpGenome Universal Methylated DNA (Chemicon)
and human genomic DNA (Clontech) were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively.

Total RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcription
Total RNA from parental and Docetaxel-resistant
cells was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and purified
with RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). The RNA Integrity
Number (RIN) was assessed on the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer device (Agilent Technologies, Massy,
France). All specimens included in this study displayed
a RIN of 10.

Bisulfite Sequencing Analysis
Primers were designed to include methylated
and unmethylated alleles overlapping 2 regions 1-1573
(1573bp) and 49023-49994 (971 bp) covering the exon
1 and 2 respectively of the LZTS1 gene. To analyse the
CpG methylation status of LZTS1 promoter, PCR reaction
was carried out in a 50μl mixture containing 0.2mM each
dNTP, 1.5mM or 3mM MgCl2, 400nM of each primer,
80ng of bisulfite-treated DNA and 1U GoTaq Hot Start
Polymerase (Promega). The PCR cycling profile consisted
of a step at 95°C for 2min, followed by 4 cycles of 94°C
for 30sec, 62°C for 30sec and 72°C for 30sec; 38 cycles
of 94°C for 30sec, 60°C for 30sec and 72°C for 30 sec;
and 72°C for 7min. PCR products were run in 1% agarose
gel and were purified using Sephadex G-50 (Amersham
Biosciences, Cleveland, OH, USA) and then directly
sequenced using the BigDye Term v1.1 Cycle Sequencing
Kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were
purified enzymatically using ExoSAP-IT (Affimetrix,
Santa Clara) and were run on an ABI 3730 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems - Life Technologies,
Saint-Aubin, France). The collected data were analysed
using SeqScape analysis software (Applied Biosystems).
The methylation status of CpG islands was determined by
direct sequencing of both strands and by estimation of the
relative peak height of the PCR products.

Oligo Microarray Technology
Gene expression was profiled using a 4×44K
Human Whole Genome (G4112F) expression array
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Cal.) with a dye-swap
competitive hybridization procedure, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from untreated
parental IGR-CaP1 cells was used as the RNA reference.
Total RNA from IGR-CaP1 cells resistant to 5nM,
12nM, 25nM 50nM, 100nM, and 200nM of Docetaxel
respectively, were used as samples. Image analyses
(quantification, normalization) were performed with
Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies) and
gene expression analysis was performed using Resolver
software (Rosetta Inpharmatics). Analysis of genes
differentially expressed between parental and resistant
cell lines was performed with an absolute fold change
>2 and p-value <10-10. Using this procedure for each
of the 6 combined experiments, a list of 244 probes was
extracted. These genes were sorted out by the mean fold
change obtained from the mean of Log(Ratio) for the 6
doses of resistance to Docetaxel. The list of the 99 mostly
modified genes (fold change >5 and p-value <10-10) is
shown in Table SI. All raw microarray data are available
on Array Express at the European Bioinformatics Institute
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress; accession number:
E-MTAB-1221).

siRNA transfection and Western blot analysis
Cells were transiently transfected with synthetic
siRNA (Stealth RNAiTM) targeting the genes of interest or
negative controls (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried
out using lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen). Forty
hours or 72h after transfection, cell survival assays were
performed on untreated cells or treated with Docetaxel
675

as mentioned in figure legends. Whole cell extracts were
prepared in RIPA buffer with proteases inhibitors (Roche)
and 40µg of lysates were used for Western-Blot probed
with specific antibodies. Immunoblot analyses were
performed using the enhanced chemoluminescence-based
detection kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, IGRCaP1 cells were transfected with the pCMV-CDC25C
expression vector (Origene) or pCMV empty vector
using jetPRIME transfection reagent (Ozyme). 48h
after transfection, CDC25C and LZTS1 proteins were
co-immunoprecipitated using standard procedures and
subjected to immunoblotting. Cells were treated for 48h
with inhibitors in the presence or absence of Docetaxel,
lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoblotting.
