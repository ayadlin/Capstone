BACKGROUND. Few studies have compared primary neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. The need for preoperative chemotherapy with doxorubicin or taxanes may be reduced in
postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive tumors. This randomized, controlled, phase 2 study
evaluated the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with endocrine
treatment with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women with ER-positive
and/or PgR-positive breast cancer.
METHODS. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive neoadjuvant anastrozole 1 mg/day (n 5 61) or exemestane 25 mg/day (n 5 60) for 3 months or
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 with paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 (four 3-week cycles). Study
end points included overall objective response determined by palpation, mammography, and ultrasound, and the number of patients who qualified for breastconserving surgery and radiotherapy.
RESULTS. Clinical objective response was 64% in the endocrine therapy and
chemotherapy treatment groups. Median time to clinical response was 57 and 51
days with aromatase inhibitors and chemotherapy, respectively (P > .05). Rates of
pathological complete response (3% vs 6%) and disease progression (9% vs 9%)
did not differ significantly in the endocrine therapy or chemotherapy group,
respectively (P > .05). Rates of breast-conserving surgery were slightly higher in
the endocrine group (33% vs 24%; P 5 .058). The most frequent toxicities from
chemotherapy were alopecia (79%), grade 3/4 neutropenia (33%), and grade 2

during the preoperative treatment.

CONCLUSIONS. Preoperative neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors was well tolerated and resulted in rates similar to chemotherapy in overall

reoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as doxorubicin and taxanes is an effective treatment for patients with
breast cancer and leads to an increased rate of successful breastconserving surgery and a decreased proportion of patients with metastatic involvement of the axillary lymph nodes.1 Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy also provides an opportunity to assess potential

responses of the tumor to a given agent, which is an
important consideration in selecting postoperative
(adjuvant) therapy. Data from large phase 2 and
phase 3 chemotherapy trials have shown that 3 to 4
months of preoperative treatment can be given without compromising either locoregional control or
long-term survival.2–6
Some early nonrandomized and randomized
trials suggested that primary systemic chemotherapy
might result in improved disease-free survival rates
compared with standard adjuvant treatment,4,5 but
some of these trials were not designed as a direct
comparison of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. In 1998, the National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) reported the result
of a large prospective randomized trial (Protocol B18) that compared 4 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) given preoperatively to the same
dose of AC given postoperatively.3,7 The disease-free
survival and overall survival rates for the 2 treatment
arms of this trial were almost identical. B-18 demonstrated that clinical and pathologic tumor response
were predictors of overall survival.
Similar to other reports, despite a 36% clinically
complete response (cCR) rate, only 13% of all
patients had a pathologically complete response
(pCR), defined as the absence of invasive tumor in
the breast.3,7 A meta-analysis of 9 randomized studies (not involving taxanes) demonstrated the
equivalence of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments
for breast cancer in terms of survival, disease progression, and distant recurrence and showed that an
increased risk of locoregional disease recurrence is
associated with neoadjuvant treatment, especially
when primary systemic treatment is not accompanied by any surgical intervention (eg, radiation therapy alone).8
The NSABP Protocol B-27 was designed to determine the effect of adding docetaxel after 4 cycles of
preoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on
clinical and pathological response rates and on disease-free survival and overall survival of women with
operable breast cancer.9 Addition of docetaxel to
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide did not significantly affect disease-free survival or overall survival.
There were trends toward improved disease-free survival with the addition of docetaxel. Preoperative
docetaxel, but not postoperative docetaxel, significantly improved disease-free survival in patients who
had a clinical partial response after doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide. Pathologic complete response,
which was doubled (from 13% to 26%) with preoperative docetaxel, was a significant predictor of
overall survival regardless of treatment.9

245

However, preoperative chemotherapy may be
less effective in postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive tumors, at least with respect to
doxorubicin-containing or taxanes-containing regimens.10,11 pCR rates after chemotherapy were significantly higher among patients with tumors that were
both ER negative and PgR negative compared with
patients whose tumors had any (even low) expression of steroid hormone receptors.10 In the European
Cooperative Trial in Operable Breast Cancer, pCR
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was observed in 42%
of women with ER-negative tumors, compared with
12% in the ER-positive group.11,12
In the NSABP B-27 study, however, it appears
that patients with both ER-positive and ER-negative
tumors demonstrated an increase in pCR rates with
the addition of docetaxel. Although the proportional
increase in pCR rates was similar in ER-positive and
ER-negative tumors, ER-negative tumors had higher
rates of pCR than did ER-positive tumors when treated with neoadjuvant AC, as well as when treated
with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by
docetaxel.9
This observation agrees with multiple studies in
the neoadjuvant setting, thus indicating that ERnegative tumors are more sensitive to chemotherapy
than are ER-positive tumors.10–12
Although neoadjuvant endocrine therapy has not
been studied as extensively as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the results to date have been comparable,
with the notable exception of the breast-conserving
surgery rate, presumably because of older patient
populations enrolled in studies that used endocrine
therapy.13 Several phase 2 studies have demonstrated
the feasibility of various endocrine treatments in elderly breast cancer patients with advanced locoregional disease, thus suggesting an alternative approach
to initial surgery.14,15 Choice of patients for this strategy follows from well-established predictive and
prognostic variables for response to endocrine therapy in more advanced disease, specifically the presence of ER and PgR, advanced age, and welldifferentiated tumors. Most studies have reported
lower objective response and pCR rates (50%–70%
and <5%–10%, respectively) than have been reported
for primary chemotherapy, and the time spent on endocrine therapy required to halve the tumor volume
is often longer than that with chemotherapeutic
agents (>3 months).16
The interesting report of a cohort study of 94
patients with operable breast cancer by Cameron
et al., in which the choice of induction treatment
(chemotherapy or endocrine therapy) was based on

246

CANCER

ER status, found no difference in overall survival
between women given initial endocrine therapy and
those given chemotherapy.14 Moreover, the contribution of pathologic axillary nodal status after primary
treatment in predicting patients’ outcomes was the
same, regardless of primary treatment (endocrine
therapy or chemotherapy). Nonetheless, observations
favor primary endocrine treatment (alone or combined with chemotherapy) in patients whose tumors
are rich in steroid receptors. Other investigators treated postmenopausal women aged younger than 70
years with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive operable
breast tumors ranging from T2 >3 cm to T4 with
tamoxifen before locoregional therapy. After a median
follow-up of 83 months, median time with metastasis-free survival was 88 months, and overall survival
was 102 months in women with T4 tumors.17 Three
randomized controlled studies have evaluated the
role of primary endocrine treatment in comparison
with initial radiotherapy or surgery.15,18,19 None of
these studies showed a difference for overall survival
between the different treatments, although a nonsignificant delay in metastatic events when tamoxifen was given as induction treatment was reported in
1 study.19 Of note, the trial with the longest followup (>5 years) showed an increased failure of locoregional control when tamoxifen was given initially
(61% vs 31%; P < .0001), but the trial included smaller tumors (<5 cm) than the other 2 studies, making
a direct comparison difficult.19
To avoid chemotherapy-related toxicities, preoperative endocrine therapy is an alternative option
for women with ER-positive or PgR-positive tumors.1,20
For elderly postmenopausal women with comorbid
conditions and large hormone-responsive tumors,
breast-conserving surgery may be possible after
well-tolerated, preoperative hormonal therapy. For
these elderly patients, 4 months of letrozole resulted
in improved tumor response and rates of breastconserving surgery over tamoxifen.16,21 The clinical
response rate with presurgical letrozole was 60%,
and 48% of patients underwent breast-conserving
surgery. In contrast, the response rate with presurgical tamoxifen was 41%, with 36% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The rate of clinical
progression during the 4 months of therapy was 8%
in the letrozole arm and 12% in the tamoxifen
arm.16,21
Because a reduction in tumor volume may allow
breast-conserving surgery and because of the potential for reduced efficacy of preoperative doxorubicin
or taxanes in postmenopausal patients with ERpositive and/or PgR-positive tumors, alternative neoadjuvant therapies are under investigation. Before the

current trial, there were few, if any, direct comparisons of primary neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with
primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
hormone-responsive breast cancer. The objective of
this study was to compare effects of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitors
on tumor responses and subsequent eligibility for
breast-conserving surgery in postmenopausal women
with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was an open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial of
once-daily endocrine therapy (exemestane or anastrozole) or chemotherapy (doxorubicin and paclitaxel, every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) in postmenopausal
women with primary ER-positive breast cancer. The
trial design is illustrated in Figure 1. All patients provided written informed consent, and institutional
review board approval was obtained at each center.
Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to
receive endocrine therapy or chemotherapy according to a predetermined, computer-generated, randomized list that used permuted blocks. The same
method of randomization was then used to assign
patients within the endocrine group to receive exemestane or anastrozole. After they were randomly
selected, patients received either exemestane 25 mg
or anastrozole 1 mg daily for 3 months or combined
chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and paclitaxel
200 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, 4 cycles) before surgery,
unless the patient was withdrawn earlier because of
progressive disease, an adverse event, or patient and/
or investigator request. Surgery was scheduled 3
months from the date the patient received her first
treatment. Patients who did not progress were considered to have completed the study when they had
received 3 months of endocrine treatment or 4 cycles
of chemotherapy and were assessed for surgery.
Treatment of each patient after surgery was at
the investigator’s discretion. It was typically recommended that patients receive tamoxifen for 5 years.
All patients are being followed for development of
local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival at 5
years postsurgery.

Study Population
Eligible patients were postmenopausal women with
untreated, histologically confirmed, primary invasive
breast cancer, with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive
tumors and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. All

received her first treatment.

tumors were stage IIA (T2, N0, M0) to IIIB (T4, N0-2,
M0) without distant metastases defined as follows:
tumor >2 cm but 5 cm in greatest dimension (T2),
tumor >5.0 cm in greatest dimension (T3), tumor of
any size with direct extension to chest wall or skin
(T4); no regional lymph node metastasis (N0), metastasis to movable ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes
(N1), or metastases to ipsilateral axillary lymph
nodes fixed or matted (N2); and no distant metastasis (M0; patients were stage IIA to IIIB; the staging
system used for this study may be found in the
American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, 6th Edition).21 Patients with T2 tumors were not
eligible for breast-conserving surgery. Postmenopausal status was defined as an absence of spontaneous menses for at least 1 year in women older than
55 years of age; amenorrhea in women younger than
55 years and postmenopausal gonadotropin levels
(lutropin and follitropin levels >40 IU/L) or postmenopausal estradiol levels (<5 ng/dL), or levels
within the postmenopausal range for the local labo-

ratory; or bilateral oophorectomy before the diagnosis of breast cancer. ER and PgR status was
determined by immunohistochemistry (Allred score)
with >10% positive malignant epithelial cells or by
the dextran charcoal method. Tumor size was determined by clinical examination, mammography, and
ultrasound.
All patients were required to have documented
evidence of adequate bone marrow function (white
blood cells >3.5 3 109/L, platelets >100 3 109/L,
and hemoglobin >11.0 g/dL), renal function (creatinine <120 lmol/L), and hepatic function (bilirubin
<25 lmol/L, and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase <60 U/L).
Exclusion criteria included prior chemotherapy
or endocrine therapy, uncontrolled cardiac disease,
bilateral or inflammatory breast cancer, distant metastases, and other malignant diseases (except cervical carcinoma treated in situ or adequately treated
basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin). Coadministration of other cancer treatments was not

permitted, and hormone replacement therapy must
have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks before
the start of the study.

Study Assessments
At the initial study visit, demographics and a complete medical history were recorded for each patient.
Patients also underwent a physical examination and
a review of current medical conditions, cancer diagnosis, and menopausal status. The clinical stage of
the tumor was determined by measuring the primary
breast lesion and axillary lymph nodes (if applicable)
by physical examination. Mammography, breast
ultrasound, and samples for ER and PgR status were
also obtained. Core biopsies for the correlative
science protocol were obtained before the start of
trial medication.
Patients were assessed for tumor response
according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria
by monthly clinical examination. Tumor response
was also evaluated by ultrasound at the end of
Months 2 and 3. If early progression was suspected,
ultrasound was performed at the end of Month 1. At
the final visit, ultrasound, mammography, and assessment for surgery were performed, and sampling for
the correlative science protocol was repeated.
Evaluation of adverse events and concomitant
medications and/or therapies were also assessed at
each monthly visit. Adverse events were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.22
An electrocardiogram, physical examination, and
measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction
were performed at diagnosis and after each phase of
chemotherapy. The measurements were determined
by a multigated angiogram or echocardiography with
the same technique used throughout the study for
each individual patient.
Study End Points
The primary efficacy end point was objective
response rate defined as the percentage of patients
in each treatment arm with a complete response
(CR) or a partial response (PR) as determined clinically by breast palpation (CR, regression 100%; PR,
regression >50%). Response categories were CR, PR,
no change, progressive disease, or not assessable/not
evaluable (NA/NE). Palpable ipsilateral axillary lymph
node involvement downgraded a clinically complete
response (cCR) to a PR.
Secondary efficacy end points included the percentage of patients who underwent breast-conserving
surgery and the response rate (CR 1 PR) determined
by mammography and ultrasound at 3 months. The

number of patients with a pathologically complete
response (pCR) at surgery was also recorded.
Surgical breast and axillary node resection specimens were carefully evaluated for pathologic tumor response. Pathologic determinations were
made by institutional pathologists who were provided with guidelines for tumor assessment before
starting the trial. Patients without residual cancer in
the breast were considered to have had a pCR.
Patients whose residual cancer consisted of only
noninvasive cancer were classified separately.
Because these definitions did not consider histological nodal status, patients with noninvasive or no residual cancer could have had positive axillary lymph
nodes.

Statistical Methods
Based on the primary efficacy end point (objective
response rate determined by clinical palpation), it
was calculated that a sample size of 239 patients
would provide 80% power to detect the absence of a
difference between the endocrine group and the
chemotherapy group at a 5% significance level (2sided), by using the Fleiss formula.23 Based on a
review of early data on neoadjuvant treatment, a
response rate of 62% was expected for the aromatase
inhibitors and 63% for chemotherapy.16
Treatments were compared by using the MantelHaenszel chi-square test stratified by baseline tumor
size (T2,>T2) and nodal involvement (N0,>N0).
Secondary end points, including the proportion of
patients in each treatment group with a complete
response or part response assessed by ultrasound or
mammography, as well as the number of patients in
each treatment group who underwent breast-conserving surgery, were analyzed by using the same statistical test. An exploratory logistic regression analysis
was conducted to examine the influence of baseline
tumor size (T2, >T2), nodal involvement (N0, >N0),
and age (<70 years, 70 years) on objective response
rate as determined by clinical palpation and on the
rate of breast-conserving surgery.
If a patient discontinued study treatment earlier
than 3 months (2 weeks) and had a last assessment
of progressive disease, the earlier diagnosis of progressive disease was counted. If a patient discontinued study treatment earlier than 3 months (2
weeks) for other reasons, then the final response was
considered to be NA/NE for the analysis.
All patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer
documented at study entry, who received at least 1
dose of study medication, and who were treated at a
center compliant with Good Clinical Practice were
included in the efficacy intent-to-treat population.

Baseline Patient Characteristics

RESULTS
A total of 239 postmenopausal women with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive breast cancer (tumor classifications T2N1-2, T3N0-l, T4N0M0) were randomized
to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n 5 118), or
hormonal therapy with exemestane (n 5 60), or anastrozole (n 5 61). Six patients (2 endocrine therapy, 4
chemotherapy) who did not receive study medication
were excluded from analysis. All patients were considered to be ineligible for breast-conserving surgery
at enrollment. Baseline characteristics of both treatment groups were well balanced according to age,
hormone receptor status, and disease stage. The majority (>75%) of patients were older than 60 years of
age. All patients had hormone receptor-positive
tumors. Fifty-eight percent of patients with ER-positive or PgR-positive tumors received endocrine therapy, and 53% of patients with both ER-positive and
PgR-positive tumors received chemotherapy. Tumors
were classified as T2/3 in 86% and 79% of patients
randomized to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy,
respectively, and/or N0/1 in 84% of patients in both
groups (Table 1).
Representative tumor responses, using clinical
examination and mammography according to WHO
criteria, are shown in Figure 2. There was no statistically significant difference in overall objective
response (CR 1 PR) between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. The primary efficacy
end point (CR 1 PR determined by palpation) was
similar in the endocrine group (anastrozole, 62%; exemestane, 67%) compared with chemotherapy (63%, P
> .5; Table 2). The median time to clinical response
was 57 days in patients who were receiving endocrine
therapy and 51 days in patients who were receiving
chemotherapy (P >.98). pCR in the primary breast tumor occurred in 6% and 3% of patients receiving
chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, respectively (P
> .05). The responses determined by mammography
and ultrasound were similar for endocrine therapy
and chemotherapy: 60% versus 63% (P > .5) and 40%
versus 46% (P > .5), respectively (Table 3). A secondary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients
who underwent breast-conserving surgery. There was
a nonsignificant increase in the proportion of patients
suitable for breast-conserving surgery in the endocrine therapy group compared with the chemotherapy group (33% vs 24%; P 5 .058).
There was a trend toward higher overall rates of
objective response and breast-conserving surgery

After completing neoadjuvant treatment, 31
(13%) patients did not undergo surgical resection:
5.7% of patients who were receiving endocrine therapy and 7.2% of patients who were receiving chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients did not receive surgery
because of disease progression. These patients were
switched to the other study therapy: patients initially
treated with endocrine therapy received chemotherapy, and patients treated with chemotherapy received
endocrine therapy. Progressive disease was observed
in 9% of patients who were receiving endocrine therapy and in 9% of patients who were receiving chemotherapy (P > .5). Stable disease was seen in 21% of
patients who were receiving endocrine treatment and
in 26% of patients who were receiving chemotherapy.
Nine patients remained inoperable.

DISCUSSION
Surgery is an essential component in the management of breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery is
preferred, but not all women are eligible. Neoadjuvant therapy may increase the proportion of women
eligible for breast-conserving surgery by reducing tumor size, and chemotherapy and endocrine therapy
with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have been
investigated in this setting.

Neoadjuvant therapy should not replace standard
adjuvant therapy. Rather, it represents a reasonable
alternative for women with palpable unicentric cancers who require mastectomy, and it is an excellent
arena for clinical trials.
Aromatase inhibitors have shown superiority
over tamoxifen in permitting breast-conserving surgery when used as preoperative therapy for 3 to 4
months.24–28 An additional advantage of neoadjuvant
treatment is that it can be used as an in vivo test to
assess tumor sensitivity to the treatment. Clinical
data support the hypothesis that the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of primary tumors and micrometasTherefore,

the steroidal aromatase inactivator exemestane with
the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in

and in patients who were receiving anastrozole. It
allowed us to review and to analyze dates on all
patients who were receiving aromatase inhibitors in
the endocrine therapy group.
This report describes the first randomized, openlabel, clinical trial comparing preoperative endocrine
treatment (the aromatase inhibitors exemestane and
anastrozole) and chemotherapy (4 cycles of doxorubicin with paclitaxel). The results of this study
showed that 3 months of preoperative endocrine
therapy is as effective as preoperative chemotherapy
in postmenopausal women with ER-positive and/or
PgR-positive breast cancer. The similar times to
response with both treatments indicate that the preoperative treatment period of 3 months was not biased in favor of either endocrine treatment or
chemotherapy.
Comparison of the outcome of this study with
results from other studies of preoperative chemotherapy alone is difficult because most preoperative
chemotherapy studies have not reported data specifically for postmenopausal patients with ER-positive
and/or PgR-positive tumors.7,9 Preoperative chemotherapy is considered to have higher response rates
(65%–78%) than preoperative hormonal therapy.4,16
However, it is clear that the efficacy of preoperative
chemotherapy may be reduced in postmenopausal
patients with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive tumors,
at least with respect to regimens employing doxorubicin plus taxanes.10,11 The endocrine response rate

of 64% observed in this study is, therefore, highly
encouraging, particularly given the simplicity and
low toxicity of the regimen.
Several recent studies support the use of aromatase inhibitors as neoadjuvant therapy for hormoneresponsive breast cancer. For example, we recently
reported the results of a study comparing the efficacy
of exemestane and tamoxifen as neoadjuvant therapy.32 In that study, 151 postmenopausal women
with ER-positive and/or PgR-positive breast cancer
were randomly assigned to receive exemestane or tamoxifen for 3 months. Neoadjuvant treatment with
exemestane significantly improved clinical objective
response (76% vs 40%; P 5 .05) and the rate of
breast-conserving surgery (37% vs 20%; P 5 .05), but
it did not result in any significant differences in
objective response as determined by mammogram or
ultrasound.32 Thus, exemestane is more effective
than tamoxifen as a neoadjuvant treatment option
for postmenopausal women with ER-positive disease.
At least 6 relatively small studies (n 5 11 to 38)
have evaluated neoadjuvant therapy with exemestane.33–38 Dixon et al evaluated the effect of neoadjuvant exemestane in 13 postmenopausal women with
ER-positive, operable, and locally advanced breast
cancer.33 Exemestane was given for up to 3 months.
Median tumor volume evaluated by clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasound was reduced by
86%, 84%, and 83%, respectively. After treatment, 10
patients had breast-conserving surgery with clear
margins, and 2 underwent mastectomy. In a phase 2
study reported by Tubiana-Hulin et al, 38 postmenopausal women with ER-positive operable breast cancer received 4 to 5 months of neoadjuvant
exemestane.38 Tumor response was evaluated by
using National Cancer Institute Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors.39 Six percent of patients
had a clinically complete response, 65% had a partial
response, 24% had stable disease, and 45% had
breast-conserving surgery. Taken together, these studies suggest that neoadjuvant exemestane is effective
against hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
To increase the pathologic response rate, the
combination of exemestane with chemotherapy as
neoadjuvant treatment was evaluated in 2 phase 1
studies.36,37 Wolf et al treated 14 patients with locally
advanced breast cancer with exemestane and
increasing doses of epirubicin.37 Ten of 14 patients
were evaluable: 2 patients had a complete response,
4 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1
had progressive disease. Six patients received breastconserving surgery. Lichtenegger et al carried out a
phase 1 study in 11 patients with locally advanced
breast cancer with exemestane and increasing doses

of docetaxel.36 These investigators reported that 78%
of patients had a partial response and 22% of
patients had stable disease. The pathologic response
rates were high; 78% of patients achieved grade 1
responses, and 22% achieved grade 2 responses by
staging criteria described by Chevallier et al.40
Because the combination was well tolerated with
promising clinical responses, a phase 2 study has
been initiated.
Adjuvant endocrine therapy will continue to be
an important component of care for patients with
hormone-responsive breast cancer. Sufficient evidence from clinical trials now exists that demonstrates the superior efficacy and improved tolerability
of the third-generation aromatase inhibitors over
both tamoxifen and other second-line therapies such
as aminoglutethimide and megestrol acetate for metastatic desease.25–28,41–46
Several large studies (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone
or in Combination [ATAC], Breast International
Group 1–98 trial [BIG 1–98], National Cancer Institute of Canada MA17 trial [MA17], Austrian Breast
and Colorectal Cancer Study Group [ABCSG], and the
Arimidex Nolvadex [ARNO 95] Studies) attest to the
value of third-generation aromatase inhibitors in
the adjuvant systemic therapy of postmenopausal
women with endocrine-responsive early breast
cancer,26,47–50 and such therapy has been recommended as part of the standard of care in this
patient group.49,51
Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy also has a role in
the treatment of breast cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive disease who are unable to tolerate toxicities associated
with chemotherapy or who may be ineligible for immediate surgery.1,17 In these patients, neoadjuvant
therapy offers the promise of improving survival or
enabling subsequent breast-conserving surgery. As in
advanced breast cancer, the third-generation aromatase inhibitors have proven to be better tolerated
than tamoxifen, with efficacy comparable to or
superior to neoadjuvant therapy. Thus, the aromatase
inhibitors should be strongly considered as alternatives to tamoxifen, which has long been the standard
of care.
This trial has shown that preoperative endocrine
therapy with aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole or
exemestane) offers the same rate of overall objective
response and breast-conserving surgery as chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive
tumors. The frequency of adverse events was higher
among patients who were receiving chemotherapy.
Endocrine treatment was well tolerated. Preoperative
endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors is a rea-

sonable alternative to preoperative chemotherapy for
postmenopausal women with ER-positive disease in
clinical situations in which the low toxicity of the
regimen is considered an advantage, for example, in
women older than 70 years of age. Additional studies
that assess long-term outcomes of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors are
needed.
