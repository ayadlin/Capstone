Abstract
One-third of all estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast tumors
treated with endocrine therapy fail to respond, and the
remainder is likely to relapse in the future. Almost all data on
endocrine resistance has been obtained in models of invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC). However, invasive lobular carcinomas
(ILC) comprise up to 15% of newly diagnosed invasive breast
cancers each year and, whereas the incidence of IDC has
remained relatively constant during the last 20 years, the
prevalence of ILC continues to increase among postmenopausal women. We report a new model of Tamoxifen (TAM)resistant invasive lobular breast carcinoma cells that provides
novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocrine
resistance. SUM44 cells express ER and are sensitive to the
growth inhibitory effects of antiestrogens. Selection for
resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen led to the development of
the SUM44/LCCTam cell line, which exhibits decreased
expression of ERA and increased expression of the estrogenrelated receptor ; (ERR;). Knockdown of ERR; in SUM44/
LCCTam cells by siRNA restores TAM sensitivity, and overexpression of ERR; blocks the growth-inhibitory effects of
TAM in SUM44 and MDA-MB-134 VI lobular breast cancer
cells. ERR;-driven transcription is also increased in SUM44/
LCCTam, and inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP1) can
restore or enhance TAM sensitivity. These data support a role
for ERR;/AP1 signaling in the development of TAM resistance
and suggest that expression of ERR; may be a marker of poor
TAM response. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8908–17]

Introduction
Breast cancer is the second-most common cause of cancerrelated death in women (1). One of the challenges in treating breast
cancer is addressing the biological heterogeneity evident in the
existence of several histologic and molecular subtypes. Two of the
major histologic breast cancer classifications are invasive ductal
carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Currently,
ILCs comprise up to 15% of invasive breast cancer diagnoses
annually (2). Although the incidence of IDC has remained relatively

constant during the last 20 years, a significant increase in ILC
diagnosis is evident among postmenopausal women in Western
Europe and the United States (reviewed in ref. 3). Although the
increased use of estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement
therapy for relief of perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms during this same time period may have contributed to the
increase in ILC incidence (3), the precise mechanism(s) remains
uncertain.
The clinical and pathologic features of lobular tumors are
unique. ILC typically invades in a linear pattern, creating a longer,
thinner mass, which is more difficult to detect by mammography,
ultrasound, or breast self-exam (3). ILCs have a greater tendency to
be bilateral, and women with this type of breast cancer are
frequently older and have larger tumors at the time of their
diagnosis (3). A higher incidence of ILC has been reported among
women who initially present to the clinic with metastatic breast
cancer (4). Although recent clinical studies imply that ILC is less
responsive to neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy as a precursor
to breast-conserving surgery (5, 6), there are conflicting reports as
to whether patients diagnosed with ILC have a poorer, equivalent,
or improved prognosis and overall survival when compared with
IDC (reviewed in ref. 3).
Breast cancer patients whose tumors express estrogen receptor
(ER) a (ERa) may be offered endocrine or antiestrogen therapy in
addition to or in place of conventional chemotherapies. Currently,
the most widely used antiestrogen is the triphenylethylene
Tamoxifen (TAM), which functions as a partial antagonist by
competing with estrogen for binding to the ER. TAM is known to
induce a statistically significant improvement in the overall
survival rate from breast cancer (7), and f70% of all ER-positive
(ER+)/progesterone receptor (PR)-positive (PR+) breast cancers
will respond to TAM. When compared with IDC, a significantly
greater percentage of ILC tumors are ER+/PR+ (discussed in ref. 3),
suggesting that women diagnosed with this tumor subtype should
be ideal candidates for endocrine therapy. However, study results
differ as to whether ILC patients experience a better or worse risk
of mortality than IDC patients after antiestrogen treatment (8, 9).
Regardless of tumor subtype, the development of endocrine
resistance is a pervasive clinical problem (10–12). One-third of ER+/
PR+ breast tumors treated with TAM do not respond to initial
treatment, and the remaining 70% are still at risk to relapse in the
future. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to control
antiestrogen resistance in ER+ breast cancer (13), but many details of
these mechanisms continue to be unclear. Studying endocrine
resistance specifically in ILC has not been possible because of the
lack of appropriate models; the most common models of resistance
(notably MCF-7 cells) are derived from ductal adenocarcinomas (14).

Endocrine Resistance in Lobular Carcinoma

Given the unique clinical and molecular features of lobular
tumors, and the suggestion that ILC tumors may respond less well to
endocrine therapy, we have developed an ILC-specific cell culture
model of endocrine resistance. The SUM44 breast cancer cell line
was isolated from an ILC metastasis (15), is ER+/PR+, and displays
other common features of ILC such as the loss of E-cadherin (16). We
show that SUM44 cells contain functional ER and are sensitive to
growth inhibition by antiestrogens. Selection of SUM44 cells against
4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) led to the establishment of the SUM44/
LCCTam cell line, which is stably resistant to TAM. We then
identified candidate genes associated with the endocrine resistant
phenotype in SUM44/LCCTam cells and found changes in the
expression of ERa and the estrogen-related receptor g (ERRg). Our
mechanistic studies show that knockdown of ERRg in the resistant
cell line, and overexpression of ERRg in endocrine-responsive
lobular breast cancer cells, modulates TAM sensitivity. Finally, we
show that ERRg-driven transcription is increased in the resistant
SUM44/LCCTam cell line, and inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP1)
can restore or enhance TAM sensitivity in this model system.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. All cells were shown to be free of
Mycoplasma spp. contamination and maintained in a humidified incubator
at 37oC in an atmosphere containing 95% air/5% CO2. Routine tissue culture
reagents (culture medium and additives, PBS, trypsin, etc.) were purchased
from Invitrogen.
SUM44 cells were routinely cultured in serum-free medium plus insulin
and hydrocortisone (SFIH) as described previously (15). LCCTam cells were
maintained in SFIH containing 500 nmol/L 4HT (Sigma). LCCTam cells
were cultured in SFIH in the absence of 4HT for 1 wk before all experiments.
When SUM44 and LCCTam were passaged, cells were seeded in SFIH
containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for the first 24 h to neutralize
trypsin and promote cell attachment. MCF-7 cells were originally obtained
from Dr. Marvin Rich (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, MI), and MDAMB-134 VI breast cancer cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection; both were maintained in improved minimal essential medium
with phenol red supplemented with 5% FBS.
17h-Estradiol (estradiol, E2) was purchased from Sigma; Fulvestrant (ICI
182,780; Fulv) and the c-JUN peptide inhibitor were purchased from Tocris
Bioscience. The 3xERE-tk-luc promoter-reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Malcolm G. Parker (Imperial College, London, United Kingdom;
ref. 17), 3xSF1RE-luciferase was a gift from Dr. Jean-Marc Vanacker (Institut
de Génomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon, Université de Lyon, Lyon, France;
ref. 18), and 3xAP1-luciferase was generously provided by Dr. Richard Pestell
(Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA).
The plasmid encoding wild-type murine ERRg bearing an NH2-terminal
hemagglutinin (HA) tag (pSG5-HA-ERR3) was a gift from Dr. Michael
Stallcup (Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los
Angeles, CA; ref. 19). Small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide duplexes
directed against ERRg (siGENOME SMARTpool), nonsilencing control
oligonucleotides, and the DharmaFECT 1 reagent were purchased from
Dharmacon. The FuGene 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche.
Luciferase promoter-reporter assays. Cells were seeded in SFIH at a
density of 9  104 cells per well in 12-well plastic tissue culture dishes for 24
to 48 h before transfection with 0.6 Ag luciferase promoter-reporter
construct and 0.2 Ag phRL-SV40 Renilla internal control (Promega). The
following day, transfected cells were refed with SFIH, or SFIH containing
10 nmol/L E2, 1,000 nmol/L 4HT, 100 nmol/L Fulv, 20 Amol/L c-JUN peptide
inhibitor, or ethanol vehicle as indicated in each figure for a further 24 h
before lysis and measurement of luciferase activity by using the Dual
Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) as described previously (20). Luminescence
was quantified using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (EG&G Berthold).
Proliferation assays. Cells were seeded in SFIH at a density of 2 to 3  104
per well in 24-well plastic tissue culture dishes 1 d before the addition of the

www.aacrjournals.org

indicated concentrations of drug or ethanol vehicle. Cells were cultured for
6 d with two medium changes before being trypsinized, resuspended in PBS,
and counted using a Z1 Single Coulter Counter (Beckman/Coulter). At least
three independent assays were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and
the data were normalized to vehicle-treated cells.
BrdUrd ELISAs. Cells were seeded in SFIH at a density of 1  104 cells
per well in 96-well plastic tissue culture dishes 1 d before the addition
of drug or ethanol vehicle as indicated. Cells were then cultured for f54 h
before the addition of BrdUrd ( final concentration 10 Amol/L) for an
additional 18 h (total incubation in drug, 72 h) before performing the Cell
Proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd (colorimetric) assay as directed by the
manufacturer (Roche). At least three independent assays were performed
with five replicate wells per treatment group, and data were normalized to
vehicle-treated cells.
BrdUrd immunofluorescence assays. These assays were performed as
described above (drug treatment and BrdUrd addition) and by Riggins and
colleagues (cell seeding and staining procedures; ref. 21) with the following
modifications: ERRg expression was detected using the HA.11 monoclonal
antibody from Covance (1:500) followed by AlexaFluor594-conjugated goat
anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen; 1:500), and BrdUrd incorporation was detected using the AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-BrdUrd
antibody (1:10; BD Biosciences). Cells were visualized on a Nikon E600
epifluorescence microscope at 20 magnification.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were seeded in SFIH at a density of 5  104
cells per well in 6-well plastic tissue culture dishes 1 d before the addition of
1,000 nmol/L 4HT or ethanol vehicle. Cells were then cultured for 72 h before
harvesting and cell cycle analysis by the Vindelov method (22).
Derivation of SUM44/LCCTam cells. A TAM-resistant SUM44 variant
was established according to previously published procedures (23).
Subconfluent T-25 cm2 tissue culture flasks of SUM44 cells were selected
against increasing concentrations of 4HT, beginning with 1 nmol/L. After
3 passages of the cells at each dose, the drug concentration was increased
(1!5!10!50!100!500 nmol/L), terminating at a concentration of
500 nmol/L 4HT. Cells proliferating in 500 nmol/L 4HT were designated
SUM44/LCCTam (hereafter abbreviated as LCCTam). LCCTam cells were
cultured in SFIH in the absence of 4HT for 1 wk before all experiments.
Comparative genomic hybridization. Normal control DNA was
prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a normal donor and
test DNA was extracted from the cultured cell lines (SUM44 and the
TAM-resistant LCCTam variant) using standard protocols, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed as previously
described (24). Gray scale images from at least 10 metaphases from
each hybridization were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device
CCD camera (CH250; Photometrics) connected to a Leica DMRBE
microscope equipped with fluorochrome specific optical filters TR1, TR2,
TR3 (Chroma Technology). Quantitative evaluation of the hybridization
was done using commercially available software (Applied Imaging).
Average ratio profiles were calculated as the mean value of at least eight
ratio images to identify chromosomal copy number changes in all cases
(see Supplementary Fig. S1).
RNA isolation, gene expression microarray preprocessing, and data
analysis. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent T-25 cm2 tissue
culture flasks of SUM44 and LCCTam cells, then processed and arrayed as
described by Gomez and colleagues (25). Microarray data quality was then
assessed using several tools, including those recommended by Affymetrix
and a series of additional QC measures under development in our
laboratory (26). The Robust Multiple-Array Average method was used to
preprocess the raw gene expression data, as implemented in the
Bioconductor project.4 We then isolated a reduced dimension data set that
included genes that exhibit z2 fold change (P < 0.05) and genes with
intensity zlog2 (10) in both SUM44 and SUM44/LCCTam groups. Data
visualization before and after dimensionality reduction was facilitated by
multidimensional scaling as estimated using Principal Component Analysis

(PCA) and Discriminant Component Analysis (27), to ensure that the global
structure of the data were not altered by dimensionality reduction
procedures (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Expression data are available
through the Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession GSE12708.
Real-time qPCR. Total RNA from independent cultures (not RNA from
cultures used for microarray analysis) was isolated, cleaned, quantified, and
reverse-transcribed as described in (25). qPCR reactions for each cDNA
sample and a standard curve were performed using TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix and the following TaqMan Gene Expression Assay primers
(Applied Biosystems): ESR1, Hs00174860_m1; ESRRG, Hs00155006_m1; and
the housekeeping gene RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) as in Gomez and
colleagues (25). Expression data for each gene was estimated relative to
the housekeeping control, and these data were used to calculate the ratio of
expression relative to that in the parental SUM44 cell line.
Cell lysis and Western blot analysis. Subconfluent monolayers of cells
were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot as in Bouker and
colleagues (28). Primary antibodies for ERRg (1:1,000), ERRa (1:500), and ERRh
(1:500) were purchased from GenWay. Antibodies for ERa (1:500) and ERh
(1:1,000) were purchased from NovoCastra and Affinity Bioreagents,
respectively. Antibodies for FASN (1:500) and HMGCS2 (1:2,000) were
purchased from Abcam. To confirm equal loading, membranes were reprobed
using a h-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5,000) purchased from Sigma, or a
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) goat polyclonal antibody (1:5,000) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from GE
Healthcare and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Densitometry was performed using
NIH ImageJ software5 and images were compiled using Adobe Photoshop CS2.
ERR; siRNA. LCCTam cells were seeded in 96-well plastic tissue culture
dishes in SFIH at 1  104 cells per well 1 d before transfection with
100 nmol/L ERRg (siERRg) or nonsilencing control siRNA oligonucleotides
(siC) using DharmaFECT1 (Dharmacon) according to manufacturer’s
specifications. The next day, cells were treated with 1,000 nmol/L 4HT or
ethanol vehicle before addition of BrdUrd for an additional 18 h (total
incubation in drug, 48 h). Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd (colorimetric)
assays were performed as described above. In parallel, cells were seeded in 12well dishes at a density of 9  104 cells per well, transfected with 100 nmol/L
siC or siERRg, and cells were lysed on the same day that BrdUrd ELISAs were
performed (total transfection time, 72 h) for Western blot analysis.
Statistics. All statistical calculations were performed using SigmaStat
version 3.0 (Systat). Luciferase promoter-reporter, cell proliferation, BrdUrd,
real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and microarray data from
in vitro studies were compared using either Student’s t test or one-way
ANOVA followed by post hoc t test, as appropriate, and indicated in the text
and figure legends. Statistical significance is defined at z95% confidence
level, or a P value of V0.05.

Results
SUM44 cells have functional ER and are sensitive to growth
inhibition by 4HT. The SUM44 breast cancer cell line was derived
from an ILC and a high percentage of ILC tumors are ER+ (29).
Although this cell line is also ER+ (15), ER functional status is
unknown and SUM44 responsiveness to estrogens and antiestrogens has not previously been determined. Therefore, SUM44 cells
were transfected with the 3xERE-tk-luc reporter construct and
stimulated with estrogen, antiestrogen, or ethanol control (Fig. 1A).
Estrogen (E2) modestly but significantly induces, whereas 4HT
significantly decreases, ERE-luciferase activity (P < 0.001). We also
observed that the steroidal antiestrogen Fulv decreases EREluciferase activity, and that both 4HT and Fulv block the E2induced stimulation of ERE-luciferase activity (P < 0.001). These
data suggest that the SUM44 ER responds appropriately to
estrogenic and antiestrogenic stimuli.

To determine whether SUM44 cells are sensitive to growth
inhibition by 4HT, cells were treated with antiestrogen as indicated
for 6 d (Fig. 1B, closed circles). 4HT significantly inhibits the
proliferation of SUM44 cells (ANOVA P < 0.001). The observed
reduction in cell number is also reflected in an inhibition of DNA
synthesis as shown by reduced BrdUrd incorporation after 72 hours
of 4HT treatment (ANOVA P < 0.001; Fig. 1C, closed circles),
consistent with the known cytostatic effect of 4HT (12).
Generation of a TAM-resistant SUM44 variant. Because ILCs
are predominantly ER+ and TAM has been the most widely used
endocrine agent for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer, we sought
to develop a TAM-resistant ILC model using the SUM44 cell line.
Cells were selected against increasing concentrations of 4HT, and
the cell population proliferating in 500 nmol/L 4HT (within the
range of clinically relevant concentrations; ref. 10) was designated
SUM44/LCCTam (hereafter called LCCTam).
The basal growth rate of LCCTam is identical to that of
the parental SUM44 cell line and as expected, LCCTam cells
are no longer responsive to the antiproliferative effects of 4HT
(Fig. 1B, open triangles, N.S.), and LCCTam DNA synthesis is no
longer inhibited by 4HT (ANOVA P = 0.212; Fig. 1C, open triangles). To
further confirm that differences in SUM44 and LCCTam cell
proliferation in response to antiestrogen reflect changes
in sensitivity to the cytostatic effects of 4HT, we performed cell
cycle analysis. SUM44 cells treated with 1 Amol/L 4HT
show a significantly greater fraction of cells arrested in the
G1 phase compared with ethanol-treated controls (P V 0.001;
data not shown), whereas 4HT no longer induces an accumulation of
LCCTam cells in G1 (P = 0.722, data not shown). Together, these
findings show that SUM44 cell growth and cell cycle progression are
efficiently inhibited by 4HT, but that LCCTam cells have acquired
resistance to the inhibitory effects of this antiestrogen.
Changes in the transcriptome of LCCTam cells are not
associated with chromosomal aberrations. To characterize
further this novel ILC cell model, we determined the pattern of,
and differences in, genomic alterations and gene expression
between SUM44 and LCCTam cells using CGH and Affymetrix
gene expression microarray analysis, respectively. The genetic
lineage of the two cell lines was confirmed to be identical by DNA
fingerprinting using genetic markers at nine different loci. CGH
analysis revealed changes in the DNA copy number (gains, losses,
and amplifications) in both SUM44 and LCCTam (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Importantly, a comparison between our CGH findings and
a previously reported CGH analysis of SUM44 show a similar
pattern of aberrations (30). We found no significant difference in
the pattern of chromosomal alterations between the two cell lines;
acquired estrogen independence also is not associated with
changes in the amplification of DNA sequences (31).
In marked contrast, microarray analysis reveals a large number of
changes in gene expression. We used PCA (27) to visualize the highdimensional data set in two dimensions; SUM44 and LCCTam are
linearly separable in this two-dimensional PCA projection based on
the top two principal components that capture 95% of the
cumulative variance in the data (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using a
final cutoff of z2-fold change with P V 0.05 (univariate,
uncorrected, T-statistic), we find that 380 genes are likely to be
significantly altered: expression of 91 genes are increased and 289
genes are decreased in LCCTam versus SUM44 controls (Supplementary Table S1).
To maintain focus on the TAM-resistant phenotype observed
in LCCTam cells, we first chose to investigate gene expression

Endocrine Resistance in Lobular Carcinoma

changes in ERs and other members of the nuclear receptor
superfamily. Expression of ERa (HUGO symbol ESR1) is
decreased 3.1-fold in LCCTam compared with SUM44 cells by
microarray (P = 0.0013), which was subsequently confirmed by
qPCR analysis (#2.98-fold, P < 0.001; Fig. 2A, white bars). In
contrast, expression of the orphan nuclear receptor ERRg
(HUGO symbol ESRRG) is 4.4-fold increased in the resistant
LCCTam cells by microarray (P = 0.01) and 10-fold increased by
qPCR (P = 0.03; Fig. 2A, black bars).
To confirm that differences in the mRNA expression of these
receptors are maintained at the protein level, cell lysates were
collected and analyzed for ERRg and ERa expression by Western
blot (Fig. 2B, inset). As observed for mRNA, ERRg protein
expression is increased ("2.5-fold; P = 0.03) and ERa expression
is decreased (#2-fold; P = 0.03) in LCCTam cells. We also examined
the protein levels of all other ERs and ERRs (ERh, ERRa, and
ERRh) and find no differences in their expression between SUM44
and LCCTam cells (Fig. 2C).
ERR; plays a functional role in TAM resistance in LCCTam
cells. ERRg is an orphan nuclear receptor with no known natural
ligand that has been shown to have constitutive transcriptional
activity at several DNA response elements (reviewed in refs. 32, 33).
ERRg and its family members ERRa1 and ERRh bear some
structural similarity to the ER (32, 34). Although ERRa1 has
previously been shown to activate or repress estrogen response
element (ERE)-mediated transcription depending on cellular
context (34) and to participate in HER2-dependent signaling in
BT474 breast cancer cells (35), the role of ERRg in breast cancer
therapeutic response is underexplored (36).
We hypothesized that if increased expression of ERRg in
LCCTam cells performs a functional role in the acquired TAM
resistance phenotype, knockdown of receptor expression should
restore TAM sensitivity. LCCTam cells were transiently transfected
with siRNA oligonucleotides directed against ERRg (siERRg) or a
nonsilencing control (siC) before treating the cells with 4HT
and assessing DNA synthesis as measured by BrdUrd incorporation. A 2- to 3-fold decrease in ERRg expression is attained by
siRNA (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). Importantly, ERRg knockdown also
partially restores sensitivity to 4HT in the LCCTam cells (P = 0.03
versus siERRg ethanol and P < 0.001 versus siC in 1,000 nmol/L
4HT; Fig. 3B) with no effect on the expression of ERa (Fig. 3A,
inset, bottom). These data suggest that ERRg plays a key functional
role in the LCCTam TAM resistance phenotype.

Overexpression of ERR; induces 4HT resistance. Next, we
sought to determine whether ERRg overexpression could induce
TAM resistance in endocrine-responsive breast cancer cells. SUM44
cells grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips were transiently
transfected with the pSG5-HA-ERR3 plasmid, encoding the murine
homologue of ERRg, which is 100% identical to human ERRg at the
amino acid level (19), or the empty vector (pSG5). Cells were then
treated with 1 Amol/L 4HT or ethanol vehicle and immunostained
for BrdUrd incorporation (green) and ERRg expression (HA, red;
ref. 21). In agreement with our results in Fig. 1C, 4HT significantly

Figure 1. SUM44 cell proliferation and ER transcriptional activity are inhibited
by antiestrogens, and LCCTam cells have acquired resistance to TAM. A, cells
were seeded in 12-well tissue culture dishes, transfected with plasmids encoding
3xERE-tk-luciferase and phRL-SV40 Renilla, and treated with 10 nmol/L E2,
1,000 nmol/L 4HT, 100 nmol/L Fulv, 4HT+E2, Fulv+E2, or ethanol control for
24 h before harvest and luciferase assay. ERE-luciferase values are normalized

view. In Fig. 4A, most ERRg-positive (red) cells incorporate
BrdUrd (viii, arrowheads), whereas ERRg-negative cells show
little-to-no BrdUrd incorporation (viii, *).
To confirm that ERRg can regulate TAM resistance in
breast cancer cell lines other than SUM44, we performed the same
study in MDA-MB-134 VI cells, which are ER+ and TAM-sensitive
(37) and are also considered to be of lobular origin (38). When
transfected with the pSG5 empty vector, DNA synthesis in MDA-MB134 VI cells is inhibited by 4HT by nearly 2-fold (49.9% versus 27.3%
BrdUrd incorporation, P < 0.001; Fig. 4B). However, when ERRg is
overexpressed, these cells become significantly less responsive to the
inhibitory effects of 4HT (27.3% versus 44.7% BrdUrd incorporation,
P = 0.001; Fig. 4B). Together, these data show that increased
expression of ERRg can induce TAM resistance in several ER+
lobular breast cancer cell lines.

Figure 2. ERa and ERRg mRNA and protein expression are significantly altered
during the acquisition of TAM resistance. A, total RNA was isolated from SUM44

ERR;-associated transcriptional activity is increased in
resistant LCCTam cells. A crucial difference between ERRg and
liganded nuclear receptors like ERa is the regulation of their
transcriptional activities. Whereas ERa is dependent on ligand
for full activation, ERRg and the other members of this orphan
family exhibit constitutive transcriptional activity. The ERRg
DNA binding domain is f64% identical to that of ERa (34).
Consequently ERRg can bind to the same EREs as ERa, but it
can also potently activate the steroidogenic factor-1 response
element (SF1RE; ref. 32). Although none of the ERR family
members are affected by E2 stimulation because their ligand
binding domains cannot accommodate E2 binding (discussed in
ref. 34), ERRg transcriptional activity at EREs and SF1REs can be
inhibited by 4HT (39, 40). In contrast, 4HT-bound ERRg acquires
the ability to positively regulate transcription at AP1 sites
(reviewed in ref. 34).
To begin to understand the mechanism by which ERRg upregulation confers resistance to LCCTam cells, we examined the
activity of ERE-, SF1RE-, and AP1-driven luciferase promoterreporter constructs transiently expressed in SUM44 and LCCTam
cells (Fig. 5A). Luciferase expression controlled by the ERE and
SF1RE response elements is significantly increased by 5- and
3-fold, respectively, in LCCTam cells compared with SUM44 cells
(P < 0.005). When LCCTam cells are cultured in 4HT (‘‘LCCTam+
4HT’’), ERE-luciferase activity is somewhat reduced but still
shows a nearly 2-fold increase relative to SUM44 (black bars;
P < 0.005), whereas SF1RE-luciferase activity remains high
(white bars; 3-fold above the levels in SUM44 cells; P < 0.005).
In contrast, AP1-luciferase activity increases up to 8-fold that
observed in SUM44 cells in the presence of 4HT (hatched bars;
P < 0.005).
ERR;/AP1 activity seems to drive TAM resistance in
LCCTam cells. To test whether the observed robust AP1 activity
plays a functional role in the TAM-resistant phenotype, we used a
cell-permeable peptide fragment of c-JUN that blocks its
interaction with the JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase, resulting
in strong AP1 inhibition (41). This c-JUN peptide has virtually no
effect on SF1RE-luciferase activity (Fig. 5B, N.S.) but can inhibit
AP1-luciferase activity by >2-fold (P = 0.04; Fig. 5C). Importantly,
this level of AP1 inhibition restores 4HT-mediated growth
inhibition to LCCTam cells (P = 0.001; Fig. 5D) and enhances
the sensitivity of the parental SUM44 cells to the growthinhibitory effects of 4HT (P = 0.002).
Our functional data suggest that in LCCTam cells, increased
ERRg-driven AP1 transcriptional activity is most strongly associated with TAM resistance. However, endogenous ERRg/AP1 target
genes have yet to be identified; ERRg-dependent AP1 activity has
previously been reported only on heterologous promoter constructs (42). We therefore used the TRANSFAC Professional 11.1
database (43) to search the proximal promoter regions of genes upregulated z2-fold in LCCTam cells for AP1 consensus sites within
5,000 bp of the start site. The MatchTM algorithm (44) was used to
analyze the DNA sequences and search for potential AP1 binding
sites, using Position Weight Matrices to minimize false positives.
Several genes had multiple AP1 response elements in their
promoter regions (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis was then used
to confirm the overexpression of two of these genes, HMGCS2 and
FASN (Fig. 6B). HMGCS2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
matrix gene that can regulate ketogenesis and cholesterol synthesis
(45, 46), and FASN is the final enzyme of the fatty acid biosynthetic
pathway (47). Components of all three processes have been

implicated in the etiology or progression of breast cancer, and
FASN activity can affect hormonal sensitivity in breast and
endometrial cancer cells (48–50). Therefore, we suggest that
HMGCS2 and FASN may be two novel ERRg/AP1 targets in
TAM-resistant breast cancer.

Discussion
In this study, we report the development of the first model
of endocrine-resistant breast cancer in a cell line derived
from an invasive lobular breast carcinoma, and show that the

orphan nuclear receptor ERRg and its ability to drive AP1
transcriptional activity are central to the TAM resistance
phenotype.
Selection of SUM44 cells against 4HT led to the establishment
of the LCCTam cell line, which is stably resistant to TAM. In the
resistant LCCTam cells, we observe a significant down-regulation
of ERa (although they remain ER+), accompanied by a
significant increase in the expression of ERRg. Resistance to
antiestrogens has been hypothesized to take place through
several diverse mechanisms (10, 12). One is loss or mutation of
ERa, whereas others include alterations in the profile of

hormone receptor coactivators and corepressors expressed by
the tumor, differential metabolism of antiestrogens, and changes
in the expression of additional genes that control cell
proliferation and/or apoptosis (13). One or more of these
mechanisms is likely contributing to the TAM-resistance
phenotype of LCCTam cells. Relative to SUM44, the resistant
LCCTam cells express 3-fold less ERa. However, SUM44 cells
express high basal levels of ERa.6 Consequently, the reduced
level of ERa expression in LCCTam is comparable with that
observed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (f73% of basal MCF-7
ERa levels by qPCR; data not shown). Because ERa levels in
MCF-7 cells are clearly sufficient to confer antiestrogen
sensitivity, it is unlikely that ERa down-regulation in LCCTam
is the major determinant of resistance in this model.
Our siRNA knockdown and cDNA overexpression studies are
the first to show that ERRg is an essential regulator of TAM
responsiveness in lobular breast cancer cells. Until now, the role
of ERRs (and specifically ERRg) in breast cancer therapeutic
response has not been well-understood. In 2002, Ariazi and
colleagues (36) published a study of ERR family expression in 38
breast tumors compared with normal mammary epithelial cells
(MEC). ERRg mRNA expression is nearly 4-fold higher in breast
tumors than in MECs and is positively associated with ER and
PR expression. These authors conclude that the correlation of
ERRg with ER and PR is indicative of a better prognosis (36).
Although this is certainly plausible, the presence of ER and PR
do not always indicate hormone sensitivity in breast cancer. As
discussed above, TAM therapy is ineffective in f30% of patients
with ER+/PR+ breast tumors, and the majority of initial
responders who acquire resistance to TAM and other endocrine
agents do so without losing detectable ER expression (10). 4HTbound ERRg is also known to activate transcription at AP1 sites,
and elevated AP1 activity has previously been linked to TAM
resistance in vitro (51, 52) and in vivo (53, 54). This is consistent

with our findings that AP1 activity is robustly increased in the
resistant LCCTam cells in the presence of 4HT, and that AP1
inhibition reverses the TAM-resistant phenotype of LCCTam cells
while increasing the sensitivity of SUM44 cells to growth
inhibition by this antiestrogen. To our knowledge, this is the
first functional consequence of ERRg-driven AP1 transcriptional
activity that has been reported.
No endogenous ERRg/AP1 target genes have yet been
identified. The genes in Fig. 6A are strong candidates as
ERRg/AP1 targets in breast cancer. We confirmed the differential
regulation of the endogenous HMGCS2 and FASN, and we
propose that HMGCS2 and FASN are putative downstream
targets of ERRg in the resistant LCCTam cell line. Further
assessment of their direct regulation by ERRg/AP1 is in progress.
HMGCS2 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial matrix gene that
can regulate ketogenesis and cholesterol synthesis (45, 46) and
FASN is the final enzyme of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway
(47). Components of all three processes have been implicated in
the etiology or progression of breast cancer, and FASN activity
can affect hormonal sensitivity in breast and endometrial cancer
cells (48–50). Moreover, ERRg has been shown to control the
switch from fetal use of carbohydrates to lipid-dependent
oxidative metabolism in the adult mouse heart by regulating a
series of genes that drive fatty acid oxidation, oxidative
phosphorylation, and mitochondrial electron transport (55). That
ERRg might also affect these metabolic processes in the context
of breast cancer and TAM resistance is intriguing and will be the
focus of future studies. Notably, this possibility is supported by a
very recent publication by Montero and colleagues (56), which
reports that increased mitochondrial cholesterol content promotes resistance to doxorubicin in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Other genes in Fig. 6A also are of interest. High LRRC15
expression has been previously linked to invasive and aggressive
behavior in breast and prostate cancer (57, 58), and MSN is a
marker of basal-like breast cancers (59); our future studies will
also pursue the role(s) of these genes in endocrine-resistant
breast cancer and their regulation by ERRg/AP1.
