Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are characterized by stem cell-derived,
unrestrained clonal myeloproliferation. The World Health Organization classification system, proposed in 2008, identifies 7 distinct categories of Ph-negative MPNs including essential thrombocythemia (ET); polycythemia vera (PV); primary myelofibrosis (PMF); mastocytosis; chronic eosinophilic leukemia; chronic neutrophilic leukemia; and MPN,
unclassifiable. For many years, the treatment of ET, PV, and PMF, the most frequently diagnosed Ph-negative MPNs,
has been largely supportive. In recent years, that paradigm has been challenged because of the discovery of a recurrent point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene (JAK2V617F). This mutation can be detected in the vast majority
of patients with PV and approximately half of patients with ET or PMF and serves as both a diagnostic marker as well
as representing a putative molecular target for drug development. Several putative targeted agents with significant
in vitro JAK2 inhibitory activity and various degrees of JAK2 specificity are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.
Furthermore, other investigational non-tyrosine kinase inhibitor approaches such as immunomodulatory agents and

Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal proliferative disorders
arising from hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells and characterized by an increased number of terminally differentiated
myeloid elements.1 Several disorders fall in this category, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia
(ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and systemic
mastocytosis.2 Taken together, PV, ET, and PMF, the 3 most common types of Ph-negative MPNs, are more prevalent
than Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), afflicting >100,000 people in the United States alone. As posited by
Dameshek in 1951, there are remarkable similarities between all of the MPNs.3 Although patients with PV can have an
increased red cell mass, low erythropoietin (Epo) levels, and endogenous erythroid colony (EEC) formation in vitro; and
those with ET present with high platelet counts and increased bone marrow megakaryocytic mass; and patients with PMF
present with anemia, splenomegaly, leukoerythroblastosis, constitutional symptoms, and marked collagen and reticulin
bone marrow fibrosis, it is known that all of these MPNs share clinical and laboratory features, making them overlap phenotypically. As examples, isolated thrombocytosis can be the presenting manifestation of PV, ET, and PMF4,5; myelofibrosis (MF)6,7 is a well-known complication of PV; PMF can evolve into PV8; and it has been shown that there is no clear
separation by bone marrow morphology, EEC, or serum Epo levels.9,10 Indeed, all 3 categories of MPNs have the potential to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia and exhibit a propensity to develop thrombotic complications. The inter-relatedness of these disorders has been substantiated in recent years by the discovery of a common pathogenetic underpinning
consisting of a recurrent somatic point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene.11-15
Indeed, prospective and retrospective studies indicate that JAK2V617F-positive ET can resemble PV and that patients
with ET with this mutation have a higher hemoglobin (Hb) and white blood cell count, an increased bone marrow cellularity, an increased thrombotic risk, a higher rate of transformation to PV, and a greater sensitivity to hydroxyurea
(HU).16 However, these findings are brought into question because it has been shown that when ‘‘PV-like’’ ET patients

had red blood cell mass studies performed, these patients
usually were found to have PV.17 Another study also demonstrated that patients with ET who were positive for
JAK2V617F had a phenotype that was more like PV than
their JAK2V617F-negative counterparts.16
Patients with JAK2V617F-negative ET may resemble
patients with PMF and frequently exhibit isolated thrombocytosis and may present with splenomegaly; cytogenetic
abnormalities; megakaryocytic dysplasia; and an increased
susceptibility to leukemic transformation, MF), and
clonal hematopoiesis.18 However, these patients with
JAK2V617F-negative ET may not actually present with features of PMF, but may actually have PMF.19
The finding that mutant JAK2 is endowed with constitutively active kinase activity has spurred great interest
in the development of therapeutic agents aimed at inhibiting this putative pathogenic event. It is interesting to
note that a mutation in JAK2 can lead to 3 different phenotypes (PV, ET, and PMF). Although the reasons for
this are not entirely clear, it is believed that the JAK2V617F
allele burden in combination with yet unidentified host
gene modifiers can lead to a different clinical phenotype.
In ET, the JAK2V617F allelic burden is usually low and
heterozygosity for the mutation is the rule.20 The malignant clonal stem cells are not shown to be increased in
number compared with the normal stem cells in the bone
marrow.21 Alternatively, in PV there is a high JAK2 allelic
burden. Although most PV patients are homozygous for
the mutation, not all are because not all have uniparental
disomy.22 In PV, the malignant clone predominates in
the bone marrow.21 In PMF, homozygosity for the
JAK2V617F mutation is predominant.23 Taken together,
homozygosity of the JAK2 mutation is perhaps not a distinguishing feature for the phenotype of these disorders. It
is has been shown that some patients with JAK2V617F–
positive erythrocytosis never develop the full clinical features of PV. Gender differences may also play a role
because ET and PV are more frequent among women,
whereas PMF predominates among men.16 These findings suggest that it is the individual host’s characteristics
that may play the definitive role in determining the ultimate clinical phenotype.
Importance of the JAK2V617F Mutation in PV,
ET, and PMF
The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation in patients with
PV, ET, or PMF has had a significant impact on the taxonomy of MPNs. The JAK family of proteins encompasses 4 members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and [tyrosine

kinase] TYK2), which are differentially activated in
response to various cytokines. JAK2 has been shown to
be predominantly activated in response to an array of
cytokines, including Epo, interleukin (IL)-3, granulocytemacrophage–colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-5,
and thrombopoietin.24 JAK kinases contain 7 homologous domains (JH1-JH7), including both a catalytic
kinase domain (JH1) and a catalytically inactive pseudokinase domain (JH2). In 2005, a G-to-T substitution at the
1849 position, resulting in the substitution of valine for
phenylalanine at codon 617 of JAK2 (JAK2V617F), was
shown to cause constitutive kinase activity.11-15 This
somatic mutation that is present in hematopoietic cells,
and occasionally in different hematopoietic compartments including B and T lymphoid cells, occurs with a
frequency of >99% in patients with PV and in approximately 50% of patients with ET or PMF. Although most
do, not all PV patients express JAK2V617F, and in familial
PV, this is particularly the case; it has been shown that
multiple genetic defects are implicated in the early pathogenesis of PV.25 Approximately 15% of patients with
familial PV are negative for JAK2V617F and this holds true
for patients with ET who convert to PV.26,27 JAK2V617F
has also been detected in other conditions, including refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia
(AML).28 JAK2V617F constitutive kinase activity confers
cytokine hypersensitivity and cytokine-independent
growth of hematopoietic cells. This is a characteristic feature of hematopoietic colonies obtained from patients
with PV and is most marked in hematopoietic cells that
co-express Epo-R, myeloproliferative leukemia virus
oncogene homolog (MPL), or granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).29 Importantly, mice carrying the
JAK2V617F mutation recapitulate multiple features of
human PV, including marked erythrocytosis and a proclivity to develop marked MF over time, thus supporting
an important pathogenetic role of this mutation in human
MPNs.30 In vitro studies demonstrate that ligand binding
to JAK2 results in kinase phosphorylation with subsequent activation of downstream signaling proteins. JAK2
leads to activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways, which could lead to transformation of
hematopoietic progenitors.31 However, JAK2 can be
absent in the blast cells at transformation, indicating that
JAK2V617F–negative leukemia can arise in patients with
JAK2V617F-positive MPNs.32 Importantly, the expression

of constitutively active STAT5 or the antiapoptotic gene
BCLXL results in Epo-independent colony formation.33
Blood samples taken from patients with PV have demonstrated STAT3 activation and BCLXL overexpression.
JAK2V617F-negative MPNs

In light of the finding that rare patients with PV and
approximately half of those with ET or PMF are negative
for JAK2V617F, systematic screenings have been conducted
in patients with JAK2V617F–negative MPNs in search of
somatic mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway.34 Four
novel somatic mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 were identified. Three of these were small deletions or insertions
involving codons 538 to 543 and the fourth was a point
mutation resulting in the substitution of lysine for leucine
at codon 539. The most frequent of all exon 12 mutations
is N542-E543del, which was found in 17 of 52 studied
cases.35 JAK2 exon 12 mutant alleles can induce cytokineindependent proliferation in Epo receptor-expressing cell
lines and lead to the constitutive activation of JAK-STAT
signaling. Patients with PV who carry JAK2 exon 12
mutations often present with isolated erythrocytosis and a
subnormal serum Epo level, and harbor EECs. Of diagnostic and pathogenetic importance is that JAK2 exon 12
mutations are mutually exclusive from JAK2V617F.
Approximately 10% of patients with PMF who are JAK2
negative display an activating mutation in the MPL gene
encoding for the thrombopoietin receptor.36 MPL belongs
to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily and on interaction with its ligand, thrombopoietin, triggers megakaryocyte growth and differentiation. A recently identified allele
carries a point mutation at codon 515 of the transmembrane-juxtamembrane junction of MPL (MPLW515L), a
mutation leading to the substitution of either leucine or lysine for tryptophan.37 Another identified mutation,
MPLW515K, involves the same codon.36 The prevalence of
MPL mutations is approximately 5% in PMF and 1% in
ET. MPL515 mutations are early, stem cell-derived events
involving both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors.38 In
vitro studies demonstrate that expression of MPLW515L
constitutively activates JAK2 and downstream signaling
pathways in a similar fashion to JAK2V617F. In vivo studies
have shown that expression of this allele results in a distinct
phenotype marked by thrombocytosis and MF.37
Current Treatment of MPN
Standard therapy for patients with MPNs has not been
firmly defined and is mostly supportive. For patients with
low-risk PV, phlebotomy is customarily used with the

664

goal of maintaining a hematocrit <45% in men and 42%
in women, and is often used as a first-line therapy for these
patients. The European Collaboration on Low-Dose Aspirin in Polycythemia Vera (ECLAP) study was a large,
prospective multicenter project of 1638 PV patients that
evaluated treatment strategies to achieve a hematocrit
<45% and a platelet count <400 109/L. Reanalysis of
this trial via multivariable analysis indicated that a hematocrit between 40% and 55% was not associated with the
occurrence of thrombotic events or mortality.39 This trial
suggested a lack of prognostic significance for the hematocrit value and the platelet count in patients with PV and
challenged the need for aggressive control of these parameters in patients for preventing thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. However, there are several concerns
with regard to this trial. First, no clear diagnostic criteria
were used in this study. The follow-up of patients in the
study was too short (mean duration of follow-up, 2.7
years) to truly establish a correlation between the hematocrit values and thrombosis. Lastly, it is known that there is
no correlation between hematocrit and the red cell mass.
Retrospective analyses among patients with Chuvash
polycythemia have not demonstrated a benefit for therapy
with phlebotomy.40 However, this cannot be used as
proof that phlebotomy is not effective in PV because Chuvash polycythemia is a congenital disorder, the pathophysiology of which is demonstrably different from that of
PV. In addition, it is unclear whether phlebotomy therapy
was conducted properly in this population.
The results of a controlled, prospective clinical trial
demonstrated that HU did not prolong survival or prevent complications of PV, including thrombosis and
MF.41 HU does appear to be effective in preventing transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients unresponsive to aspirin, and this constitutes the only selective indication for
this drug.42 Although aspirin can be effective in relieving
microvascular complications of PV, including ocular migraine and erythromelalgia, a recent review suggests that
the use of aspirin in patients with PV leads to a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of fatal thrombotic events, without an increased risk of major bleeding, compared with
patients with PV who are receiving no treatment.43
Patients with low-risk ET normally do not require therapy. The PT-1 study demonstrated that for patients with
high-risk ET, HU was no more effective than anagrelide
in preventing thrombotic events, with the exception of
TIA.44 A reason for this observation is that anagrelide is
similar to the platelet inhibitor dipyridamole, and thus it
stands to reason that anagrelide would have effectiveness

against venous thrombosis. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no established target platelet count and there is no
correlation between the platelet count and thrombosis. As
such, the targeted count should be one in which a patient
has no microvascular complications or bleeding.45 Aspirin
is recommended for patients considered to have intermediate or high-risk disease.46 Multiple supportive strategies
have been shown to be of limited activity in patients with
PMF, including HU, steroids, and androgen preparations. Recent publications have demonstrated the efficacy
of allogeneic transplantation in patients with PMF.47,48
One prospective, phase 2 study of 103 patients with PMF
or post-ET/PV MF indicated that by using reduced intensity conditioning (33 related donors or 70 unrelated
donors),49 the estimated 5-year event-free survival and
overall survival rates were 51% and 67%, respectively. As
seen earlier, although allogeneic transplantation has been
shown to prolong survival, donor availability and treatment-related mortality limit this treatment modality to a
small number of patients.50 It is therefore clear that novel
strategies aimed at eliminating the malignant clones are
needed for the management of patients with MPNs. A series of agents with activity against the mutant JAK2V617F
kinase are currently undergoing clinical testing (Table 1).

Figure 2. Mechanism of action of a Janus kinase2 (JAK2) inhibitor is shown. (A) Activation of the JAK-signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is
shown. At the time of cytokine binding, JAK2 molecules
engage with cytokine receptors and are phosphorylated,
which causes transphosphorylation of STAT molecules. In
turn, phosphorylated STAT translocates to the nucleus, where
it binds cognate DNA sequences, thus resulting in the expression of genes that regulate cell proliferation and survival. (B)
Putative mechanism of action of a JAK2 inhibitor is shown.

in immune control.51 At the time of ligand binding to its
receptor, the latter is activated, leading to activation of the
JAK2 tyrosine kinase, which in turn leads to phosphorylation of the receptor and recruitment of STAT proteins.
JAK then phosphorylates STAT proteins, leading to
STAT dimerization and migration to the nucleus, which
results in gene transcription. Patients with MPNs with
JAK2V617F have mutations in the Jhk2 domain, which has
inhibitory JAK2 properties.54 Figure 1 Bottom shows the
position of mutations. This mutation leads to constitutive
JAK2 activation, which results in increased downstream
signaling and proliferation. JAK2 inhibitors work by
interfering with JAK2. In doing so, they abrogate JAK2
activation of downstream signals, including the STAT
proteins. This disenables the increased transcription of
cellular growth signals and cytokines (Fig. 2).
INCB018424

The JAK2 inhibitor furthest along in clinical development is INCB018424, which is a potent and selective
JAK1 (concentration that inhibits 50% [IC50] ¼ 2.7
nM), JAK2 (IC50 ¼ 4.5 nM), and JAK3 (IC50 ¼ 322). It
has been found to inhibit colony formation from healthy
donor cells at a concentration of 400 nM.55 In a phase 2
study, INCB018424 was administered to 155 patients

666

with PMF, post-PV, or post-ET MF.56 Seventy-six
patients received treatment for >12 months. Optimization of the dosing regimen using the platelet count helped
determine the starting dose (either 10 or 15 mg twice
daily) and allowed for dose increases after 1 or 2 months,
with most patients subsequently receiving doses of 15 or
20 mg twice daily. The majority of patients remained on
treatment at the time of last follow-up (115 of 155
patients; 74%). With the optimized dosing regimen, a
reduction in spleen volume occurred as early as 1 month
and was durable over 6 months of therapy. Eleven of 23
patients with MF (48%) had a 35% reduction in spleen
size. INCB018424 treatment resulted in an increased
exercise capacity along with marked improvement in constitutional symptoms including fatigue, abdominal pain,
and pruritus in >50% of patients.
Of note is that INCB018424 is not specific for
JAK2V617F. Given that the JAK2-STAT pathway is highly
active in patients with MPNs, even without JAK2 mutation, the drug may be equally effective regardless of JAK2
mutational status through inhibition of the JAK2-STAT
axis. Indeed, a subset analysis of 53 patients with MF
demonstrated that the improvement in clinical symptoms
derived by INCB018424 treatment coincided with a sustained and remarkable reduction of fibrogenic, proinflammatory, and angiogenic growth factors,57 including IL-6
and tumor necrosis factor-a which have both been linked
to the pathogenesis of PMF. A prospective, uncontrolled
phase 2 trial demonstrated that of 86 evaluable patients
with PMF enrolled on study, INCB018424 therapy
resulted in a significant and rapid reduction of PMFrelated symptoms, with 53%, 66%, 46%, 50%, and 85%
of patients experiencing improvements in fatigue, abdominal pain, bone pain, quality of life, and pruritus, respectively.58 Another study evaluated the JAK2V617F allele
burden in the blood and bone marrow at baseline and
after 3 months of therapy with INCB018424 in 19
patients with PMF (n ¼ 9) and post-PV/ET MF (n ¼
10). Despite significant clinical improvement (CI) in
these patients (reduction in splenomegaly, improved constitutional symptoms), there was only a modest decrease
noted in the JAK2V617F allele burden.59
On the basis of the activity observed in patients with
PMF, a phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy of
INCB018424 in patients with advanced PV (n ¼ 34) or
ET (n ¼ 39) who were refractory to or intolerant of
HU.60 The starting doses were 10 mg twice daily in
patients with PV and 25 mg twice daily in patients with
ET. At the time of last follow-up, all 34 (100%) patients

with PV had completed 3 months of treatment, with 20
(59%) receiving the drug for >6 months. Thirty-two
patients (94%) had attained a partial response (PR) or a
complete response (CR). All 24 patients who were phlebotomy-dependent at 6 months before therapy became
phlebotomy-independent within 2 weeks of the initiation
of INCB018424. Of 21 patients with splenomegaly at
baseline, 60% had a 50% reduction in spleen size within
the first month. All 26 patients with pruritus had symptom resolution along with improvements in bone pain
and fever. All 39 (100%) patients with ET had completed
at least 3 months of treatment and 17 (44%) had been
treated for more than 6 months. Twenty-four patients
(61%) had attained a PR or CR. All 4 patients who
entered the study with splenomegaly experienced >50%
reduction in spleen size. Overall, INCB018424 was found
to be well tolerated both by patients with PV or ET. Given
the promising phase 2 findings delineated above, a phase
3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial using this JAK2
inhibitor is currently underway.
TG101348

TG101348 is an oral JAK2 inhibitor that is both a
potent and selective JAK2 inhibitor (IC50 ¼ 3 nM), but also
has JAK1 (IC50 ¼ 105) and JAK3 (IC50 ¼ 996) inhibitory
activity.61 It inhibits the growth of hematopoietic colonies
and induces apoptosis in human erythroleukemia (HEL)
and Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2V617F, MPLW515K, or JAK2
exon 12 mutations. In a murine model of PV, TG101348
decreased both hematocrit and spleen size and prolonged
survival.61 These preclinical studies led to a phase 1 multicenter dose escalation study,62 in which the maximum tolerated dose was found to be 680 mg daily. A total of 59
patients (44 with PMF, 12 with post-PV MF, and 3 with
post-ET MF, 86% of whom were JAK2V617F positive) were
enrolled (28 in the dose escalation phase and 31 in the dose
confirmation phase). Forty patients (68%) initiated treatment at a dose of 680 mg daily. After a median follow-up
of 12 weeks, 18 patients (31%) had discontinued treatment
(due to toxicity, comorbidities, withdrawal of consent, and
noncompliance). The 41 patients remaining on study were
receiving doses ranging from 240 mg to 680 mg and 33
patients who started at a dose of 680 mg daily had completed at least 3 cycles of therapy at the time of last followup. At 3 months, 22 patients (67%) had at least a 50%
reduction in spleen size. All 21 patients with pretreatment
leukocytosis had a reduction in their white blood cell count.
Of 51 patients harboring the JAK2V617F mutation, 48 had
completed at least 1 cycle of treatment and were evaluable

for a molecular response at the time of last follow-up; the
median decrease in the mutant allele burden was 48%.
Twenty-one patients (44%) had a 50% reduction in
spleen size and there was an improvement noted in symptoms including fatigue, early satiety, and pruritus. Of the 40
patients (68%) who started at doses of 680 mg, grade 3/4
neutropenia was observed in 15%/0% and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was noted in 20%/10% patients. Twenty-four
(60%) patients did not require red cell transfusions at baseline; of these patients, grade 3/4 anemia occurred in 42%
and 8% of cases, respectively. Important nonhematologic
toxicity included 1 patient each with grade 3 nausea and
vomiting, and 3 patients with grade 3 diarrhea. Although
this drug caused significant myelosuppression, the drug
overall was found to be well tolerated with manageable side
effects.
XL019

XL019 is a potent and highly selective JAK2 inhibitor. It inhibits JAK2 kinase at low concentrations (IC50
<2 nM) and other JAK kinases at higher concentrations
(JAK1: IC50 ¼ 132 nM and JAK3: IC50 ¼ 250 nM).63
One phase 1/2 study evaluated XL019 in 17 (57) patients
with PMF and 13 (43) with post-PV/ET MF. Approximately 80% of patients harbored JAK2V617F or the
MPLW515 mutation and 37% were transfusion-dependent.64,65 Initial phase 1 dose escalation began with a starting dose of 100 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle
with dose escalation up to 300 mg. Neurotoxicity was
observed in all patients given a dose >100 mg; as such,
the doses in subsequent patients were between 25 and
50 mg daily, or 25 mg given 3 times per week. Of the 30
patients who were enrolled, 21 were given a dose 50
mg. With the dose schedule of 25 to 50 mg daily, all 12
patients carrying a mutation in JAK2 or MPL experienced a reduction in spleen size. Conversely, no patients
with wild-type JAK2 experienced a response. Three of 4
patients who had 10% to 19% blasts in the peripheral
blood had a reduction in their blast count after therapy.
Twenty-one of 30 (70%) patients had discontinued the
drug at the time of last follow-up, including several
instances of nerve conduction abnormalities and altered
mentation. Because of the high rates of neurologic toxicity, the development of XL019 has been
discontinued.
Lestaurtinib

Lestaurtinib (CEP-701) is an orally available compound that inhibits the growth of cell lines carrying both

667

Review Article

the wild-type and mutated JAK2 tyrosine kinase, and
inhibits downstream signaling proteins such as BclXL and
cyclin D1/D2.66 In in vitro and in xenograft murine
models, lestaurtinib (IC50 ¼ 30-100 nM) inhibits the
growth of HEL cells, which are dependent on mutant
JAK2 activity for growth.67 In 15 of 18 patients, erythroid cells expanded from CD34-positive cells from
patients with MPNs were inhibited by lestaurtinib at a
concentration of 100 nM. Conversely, the erythroid cells
cultured from 3 healthy patients were not found to be
significantly inhibited. At clinically achievable concentrations, lestaurtinib inhibits the proliferation and JAK2/
STAT5 signaling in cells obtained from patients with
MPNs.67
A multicenter study evaluated the safety and efficacy
of lestaurtinib in patients with ET or PV who carried the
JAK2V617F mutation. To date, 20 patients (11 with PV
and 9 with ET) have been enrolled. Lestaurtinib was
administered in escalating doses of 80 to 120 mg twice
daily. Five of 8 patients with splenomegaly experienced a
reduction in spleen size within 6 weeks of the initiation of
therapy. It was well tolerated, with the main adverse
effects being gastrointestinal related. At the time of last
follow-up, 5 patients had discontinued study participation (1 because of disease progression and 4 because of
toxicity). Seven patients had completed 18 weeks of therapy and 6 of these continued to receive lestaurtinib on the
extension phase of the trial.68 Another phase 2 study evaluated this drug given at a dose of 80 mg twice daily in
patients with PMF and post-PV//ET MF, all of whom
carried the JAK2V617F mutation. Of the 22 patients
treated, 6 (27%) had a CI that lasted for a median of 14
months. No improvement was seen with regard to bone
marrow fibrosis or JAK2V617F allele burden. Grade 3/4
anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 14% and 23%
of patients, respectively.69 The Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium is currently conducting a
multicenter, open-label phase 1 study of lestaurtinib in
patients with MF (PMF or post-ET/PV) who carry the
JAK2V617F mutation.70 The drug is being administered
twice daily at doses ranging from 80 mg to 160 mg. The
minimum treatment period is 28 days, but patients may
continue for up to 6 months if they experience clinical
benefit. Thirteen of 19 (68%) patients had PMF and 7 of
these (37%) continued to receive the study drug (range, 1
to 54 weeks). The median reduction of spleen size was
6.4 cm. The mutant JAK2 allele burden in peripheral
blood decreased slightly from a pretreatment median percentage of 66.4% to 49.6% at the time of last follow-up.

668

These data suggest that lestaurtinib is active in patients
with MPNs, particularly with regard to reducing spleen
size.

SB1518

SB1518 is a potent and selective orally active adenosine-50 -triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of both
JAK2 kinase (IC50 ¼ 22 nM) and the mutant JAK2V617F
(IC50 ¼ 19 nM).71 It selectively inhibits the proliferation
of cell lines driven by JAK2 and its mutants with an IC50
of 81 nM for the murine Ba/F3 cell line transfected to
express Epo receptor and JAK2V617F. SB1518 was evaluated in a murine model of MPN that was established via
intravenous injection of Ba/F3-JAK2V617F cells. Significant therapeutic effects were observed, including normalization of leukocytosis, reduction of green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-labeled Ba/F3 cells in the peripheral blood,
resolution of hepatosplenomegaly, reduction of phosphoSTAT5, alleviation of anemia and thrombocytopenia,
and prolonged survival.71 A phase 1 dose escalation study
of SB1518 with 6 dose levels ranging from 100 mg to 600
mg daily was given to 31 patients with MF. Twenty-one
patients with MF were evaluable for a response. Seven of
17 (41%) patients with splenomegaly had a decrease in
spleen size by 35%. Overall, SB1518 was well tolerated
at doses up to 500 mg daily in patients with advanced MF
and was found to lead to a reduction in spleen size.72

JAK2 Inhibitors in Preclinical Development
Several preclinical studies are currently underway examining compounds with JAK2 inhibitory activity (Table
2).73-83 Some of them, such as AZ-01,73 EXEL-8232,76
TG101209,78 CYT387,80 and R72381,82 have demonstrated important activity in murine models of MPNs,
whereas others have only been tested in cell-based systems.
Although JAK inhibitors hold promise, the long-term
safety of these agents needs to be determined, particularly
those with JAK3 inhibitory activity because JAK3 has
been shown to play a crucial role in T-cell development
and the homeostasis of the immune system through its
association with the common c chain of cytokine receptors. The long-term side effects on the immune system are
unknown and warrant monitoring. In addition, at the
time of withdrawal of a JAK2 inhibitor, there is potential
for a cytokine rebound that could lead to a hyperinflammatory state.

Non-JAK2 Targeted Agents
Although JAK2 inhibitors hold promise as therapy for
patients with MPNs harboring a JAK2 mutation, not all
patients with MPNs carry the mutation, thus suggesting
the presence of other oncogenic events. Evidence now
exists for additional and/or antecedent mutations in
JAK2V617F mutant MPNs such as mutations involving the
ten-eleven tranlocation-2 (TET2) gene.84 It is perhaps
through the inhibition of alternative signaling pathways
important for the maintenance of the malignant clone
that some non-JAK2 inhibitor agents have proven efficacious in patients with MPNs. Alternatively, these agents
might impact the malignant clone by depriving the latter
from critical signals emanating from the bone marrow
niche. Non-JAK2 inhibitor agents offer an alternative
treatment option for patients either with or without JAK2
mutations (Table 3).
Histone deacetylase inhibitors

It has been recently reported that both JAK2 and the
mutant JAK2V617F kinases can be found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of various human leukemic cell
lines and primary CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitors.85 In the nucleus, JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3 at

Cancer

February 15, 2011

tyrosine 41 (H3Y41), which reduces the affinity of H3 to
the transcriptional repressor HP1a.85 Thus, the JAK2H3Y41-HP1a pathway links JAK2 kinase activity to histone phosphorylation, aberrant gene expression, and genome instability, and provides the rationale for the use of
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for the treatment
of JAK2-driven malignancies. ITF2357 is a synthetic class
I and class II HDACi that inhibits the autonomous proliferation of hematopoietic cells from patients with PV and
ET via downmodulation of JAK2V617F.86 A phase 2 trial
evaluated ITF2357 in patients with PV, ET, MF, and
post-PV/ET MF.87 A total of 26 patients (12 males and
14 females) with JAK2V617F positivity in PV (12 patients),
ET (1 patient), and PMF (4 patients) and post-PV/ET
MF (9 patients) were enrolled. At the time of analysis, all
patients had completed at least 1 month of therapy and 13
patients had completed 12 weeks of treatment. In patients
with PV and ET, there were 3 CRs and 8 PRs reported (3
patients demonstrated no response). A significant reduction in spleen size was reported in 6 of 8 patients with
splenomegaly, whereas 10 of 11 patients had an improvement in pruritus. An 8% median reduction in the mutant
JAK2V617F allele burden in 10 of 17 patients at 12 weeks

5 responses were reported (3 major, 1 moderate, and 1

Pegylated IFN-a

Despite its activity in MPNs, the use of IFN-a has
been severely hampered because of its unfavorable toxicity
profile and inconvenient dosing schedule. Pegylated formulations of IFN-a (PEG-IFN-a), endowed with longer
half-lives, have allowed for a weekly administration with a
more acceptable toxicity profile compared with standard
IFN-a. Studies with PEG-IFN–2a in patients with MPNs

670

have shown it to have remarkable clinical activity. A phase
2 multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of PEG-IFN–
2a in 40 patients with PV.88 Patients were followed for a
median of 31 months. At 12 months, all 37 evaluable
patients had achieved a hematologic response (95% with
CR) and only 3 patients (8%) had discontinued treatment. Twenty-six (90%) of 29 evaluable patients had a
decrease in the JAK2V617F allele burden. Before treatment,
the median JAK2V617F allele burden was 45%, which
decreased after 1 year and 3 years to 22.5% and 3%,
respectively. A molecular CR (undetectable JAK2V617F)
was achieved in 7 patients and persisted after PEG-IFN–
2a was discontinued in 5 patients. These results demonstrated the efficacy of PEG-IFN–2a not only in achieving

Experimental Therapy for MPNs/Agrawal et al

hematologic responses, but also in inducing deep levels of
molecular response, and in some cases the complete elimination of the JAK2V617F-expressing clone. Simultaneously, a phase 2 study studied the activity of PEG-IFN–2a
in patients with either PV or ET.89 Seventy-nine patients
(39 with ET and 40 with PV) were treated. The median
time from diagnosis to treatment was 54 months in
patients with PV and 33 months in patients with ET;
approximately 81% of patients had prior MPN-directed
treatment. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 18
patients with ET and 38 patients with PV. The median allele burden was 64% (range, 18.5%-94.6%) and 23%
(range, 2.9% -55.5%), respectively, for patients with PV
and ET. The initial PEG-IFN–2a dose was 450 lg
weekly, but because of poor tolerance, the dose was
decreased gradually to a starting dose of 90 lg weekly.
Seventy-seven patients were evaluable after a median of 21
months. The hematologic response rate was 80% in
patients with PV and 81% in patients with ET (CR in
70% and 76%, respectively), with the majority of
responses being achieved within 3 months of the initiation
of therapy. Fifty-one of these patients were considered
evaluable for a molecular response (16 with ET and 35
with PV). The molecular response rate was 38% (6%
complete molecular response rate) in ET patients and
54% (14% complete molecular response) in PV patients.
The JAK2V617F mutant allele burden continued to
decrease with no evidence of plateau, suggesting at last follow-up that there was selective targeting of the JAK2V617F
malignant clone. Phase 3 studies are currently ongoing to
further define the role of PEG-IFN–2a for the treatment
of patients with PV and ET.
Thalidomide

Thalidomide is a drug with known antiangiogenic
and cytokine inhibitor properties that has shown efficacy
in the treatment of MF. Results of 2 sequential, phase 2
studies analyzed the outcomes of 36 patients with symptomatic MF (28 with PMF, 3 with post-PV MF, and 5 with
post-ET MF) who received either thalidomide at a dose of
200 mg daily (n ¼ 15) or low-dose thalidomide (50 mg
daily) with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg for the first month,
0.25 mg/kg for the second month, and 0.125 mg/kg for
the third month) (n ¼ 21).90 Of the 36 patients, 20
(56%) had a response with regard to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly. After a median follow-up
of 25 months, 10 of 36 (28%) patients had an ongoing
response. Twenty-two patients (61%) were still alive at
the time of last follow-up, with 14 having died of disease-

related complications. In comparing the 2 arms, the thalidomide plus prednisone arm was found to be more effective and better tolerated. The toxicity dropout rate was 8
of 15 (53%) patients in the thalidomide alone arm compared with none of the 21 patients in the thalidomide and
prednisone arm. Although the results of this study demonstrated some patients achieving a durable remission, the
toxicity of the treatment arm using thalidomide at a dose
of 200 mg was significant.
A phase 2 dose escalation trial was undertaken
assessing the efficacy of low-dose thalidomide (50 mg
daily with dose escalation up to 400 mg) in 63 patients
with MF.91 An improvement in anemia was observed in
22% of patients, and 39% of transfusion-dependent
patients became transfusion-independent. For those
patients with a platelet count <100 109/L, the platelet
level increased by 50 109/L in 22%. The spleen size
also decreased 50% in 19% of patients. However, there
was significant toxicity noted with this regimen and the
dropout rate at 6 months was 51%.
Another prospective phase 2, randomized, doubleblind multicenter trial compared thalidomide at a dose of
400 mg daily (n ¼ 26 patients) with placebo (n ¼ 26
patients) administered for 180 days in 52 patients with
MF who had anemia (Hb 9 g/dL) or who were transfusion-dependent). No difference was noted between the
thalidomide versus placebo group with regard to either
anemia (1 in each group) or red cell transfusions (3
patients vs 5 patients). The spleen size measured via ultrasound decreased in the thalidomide arm (P < .05). However, there was significantly more somnolence and edema
reported with thalidomide and >50% of patients discontinued thalidomide after 4 months of treatment because
of adverse events. Only 10 patients were able to complete
the 6 months of therapy. This trial demonstrated the efficacy of thalidomide in decreasing spleen size, but underscored the substantial toxicity profile of this drug in
patients with PMF.92 Lastly, a phase 2 trial evaluated thalidomide at a dose of 200 mg daily (with dose escalation)
in 41 patients with MF (31 with PMF).93 A CR was seen
in 4 patients (10%); PR in 4 (10%) patients; and an
improvement in anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or
splenomegaly in 9 patients (22%). A reduction in spleen
size was found in 9 of 29 (31%) evaluable patients, with a
CR reported in 5 patients. Toxicity was notable, with19
patients developing grade 3/4 pneumonia, 9 developing
peripheral edema, and 5 developing pulmonary embolism. Although thalidomide has demonstrated activity in
patients with PMF, the side effect profile is substantial,

which spurred the investigation of better tolerated immunomodulatory agents for this indication.
Lenalidomide

Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent. Two
jointly reported phase 2 trials evaluated the efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in 68 patients with MF.94 The initial lenalidomide dose was 10 mg daily (5 mg daily if the
platelet count was <100 109/L) for 3 months to 4
months (with planned continued treatment for additional
3 or 24 months in the case of response). The response rate
was 22% for anemia, 33% for splenomegaly, and 50% for
thrombocytopenia. Eight patients with anemia demonstrated a marked response, with improvement of transfusion dependency or a Hb >10 g/dL. However, the
splenomegaly response was only 2%. Other findings of
note included resolution of leukoerythroblastosis in 4
patients, a decrease in medullary fibrosis in 2 patients, and
cytogenetic remission of del(5)(q13q33) accompanied by
a reduction in the JAK2V617F mutation burden in 1
patient. However, most responses were lost, most likely
because of the administration of lenalidomide for a limited period of time (<6 months). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 31% and 19%
of patients, respectively. On the basis of these results, a
subsequent phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of the
combination of lenalidomide and prednisone in 40
patients with MF, but in this case, lenalidomide was
administered for a minimum of 6 months and indefinitely
in patients demonstrating clinical benefit.95 The initial
dose schedule of lenalidomide was 10 mg orally daily on a
28-day cycle (21 days on/7 days off). Oral prednisone was
given at a dose of 30 mg daily during Cycle 1, 15 mg daily
during Cycle 2, and 15 mg every other day during Cycle
3. The median time from diagnosis of MF to the initiation of the combination therapy was 10 months (>3 years
in 11 patients); 75% of patients had received some form
of therapy, and 75% entered the study with splenomegaly.
The JAK2V617F mutation was found in 18 of 36 (50%)
patients tested and 20 of 40 (50%) patients were found to
have abnormal cytogenetics. With a median follow-up of
22 months (range, 6 months-27 months), 12 (30%)
patients responded according to the stringent International Working Group (IWG) criteria,96 including 8 who
carried the JAK2V617F mutation, 3 who were treatmentnaive, and 2 who failed prior therapy with thalidomide.
The median time to response was 12 weeks. Three
patients (7.5%) achieved a PR and 9 (22.5%) demonstrated CI for a median of 18 months. These endpoints

672

are clinically significant because the reduction in disease
burden can lead to amelioration of symptoms and an
improved quality of life. Anemia improved in 7 of 23
patients (30%) (3 with PRs and 4 with CI) with a pretreatment Hb <10 g/dL or who were transfusion-dependent. Splenomegaly significantly decreased in 10 of 24
patients (42%) (2 with PRs and 8 with CI). Responses
were ongoing in 10 of 12 responders who were still receiving lenalidomide at the time of last follow-up. It is interesting to note that 12 months of therapy induced a
significant decrease in the JAK2V617F allele burden among
the 8 JAK2V617F-positive responders (P ¼ .03). Four of 8
JAK2V617F-positive responders experienced a >50%
reduction in the mutant allele burden, which became
undetectable in 1 patient. No transformation to acute leukemia was observed with lenalidomide. Ten of 11 assessable responders who had grade 4 reticulin fibrosis before
the initiation of therapy had reductions to a score of 2.
The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were hematologic:
neutropenia (58%), anemia (42%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). Thirty (75%) patients discontinued therapy
(15 because of lack of response and 9 because of grade 3/4
toxicity). Although lenalidomide is associated with significant hematologic toxicity, it should be noted that the
number of patients discontinuing therapy because of side
effects (9 of 40; 22.5%) was less than that found in the trials with thalidomide, in which the toxicity dropout rate
was as high as 53% (thalidomide alone arm),90 mostly
because of nonhematologic toxicity. In the absence of
randomized trials, it is difficult to determine which
immunomodulatory agent, thalidomide or lenalidomide,
is superior in patients with PMF. However, it must be
emphasized that responses in the lenalidomide trials have
been reported according to a more stringent response criteria set (IWG) than those reported in the thalidomide
trials.
Pomalidomide

Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory agent
that has been shown to be well tolerated in several phase
1/2 studies.97 A phase 2 randomized, double-blind study
evaluated the efficacy of pomalidomide in reversing anemia in 84 patients with MF (60 with PMF, 14 with postET MF, and 10 with post-PV MF). Four treatment arms
were tested: 1) pomalidomide at a dose of 2 mg daily and
placebo (n ¼ 22); 2) pomalidomide at a dose of 2 mg
daily plus prednisone (n ¼ 19); 3) pomalidomide at a
dose of 0.5 mg daily plus prednisone (n ¼ 22); and 4)
prednisone plus placebo (n ¼ 21). Pomalidomide was

given up to 12 cycles (1 cycle was 28 days) and prednisone
at a dose of 30 mg daily was given during the first 3
cycles.98 After a median treatment period of 4.6 months
for all patients and 10 months for patients still on study,
20 patients (24%) experienced an improvement in their
anemia, including 15 (18%) who attained transfusion independence. It is interesting to note that none of these
patients experienced a reduction in spleen size. For the 62
patients receiving 3 cycles of therapy, the response rates
were 38%, 23%, 40%, and 25%, respectively. The
median response duration was 6.5 months (range, 2.3
months-16.9 months), whereas the median response duration for the 16 patients who responded to pomalidomide with or without prednisone was 7.8 months (range,
3.2 months to 16.9 months). Univariate analysis demonstrated that of the 63 patients receiving pomalidomide
with or without prednisone, there was no correlation
noted between response and MF subtype (PMF vs post PV/ET MF; P ¼ .50), platelet count (P ¼ .64), red cell
transfusion dependence at baseline (P ¼ .58), or the presence or absence of the JAK2V617F mutation (31% vs 19%;
P ¼ .28). Only an elevated white blood cell count
remained significant on multivariate analysis. No significant changes were observed regarding changes in bone
marrow fibrosis or JAK2V617F allele burden. Although
therapy was overall well tolerated, there were several 
grade 3 events, including fatigue (12%), neutropenia
(8%), thrombocytopenia (11%), anemia (10%), pneumonia/sepsis (11%), and venous thrombosis (4%).
Unlike thalidomide and lenalidomide, pomalidomide
appeared to have little effect on splenomegaly, which suggests that the clinical use of this immunomodulatory
agent may be restricted to the treatment of patients with
PMF in whom the primary clinical manifestation is anemia. Indeed, the pomalidomide (at a dose of 0.5 mg daily)
plus prednisone arm led to a 36% anemia response rate
(8 of 22 patients), which appears to compare favorably
with both single-agent thalidomide (20% anemia
response rate)90 and single-agent lenalidomide (22% anemia response rate).94
Conclusions
The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation in patients with
MPNs has provided insight into the pathogenesis of these
diseases. The high incidence of this mutation in MPNs
has spurred interest in developing agents containing JAK2
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, of which several are currently in
clinical trials whereas others have reached advanced stages
of preclinical development. Although several JAK2 inhibi-

Cancer

February 15, 2011

tors have demonstrated significant activity in patients
with MPNs, it is important to emphasize several points.
First, none of the currently available JAK2 inhibitors is a
specific inhibitor of JAK2V617F kinase and all inhibit
native JAK2 kinase and, to different extents, other members of the JAK family of kinases. Not surprisingly, these
agents have proven active both in patients with and without the JAK2V617F mutation. Therefore, the mechanism
of action of these agents remains largely unknown and
may be related to their ability to inhibit JAK-STAT–
mediated cytokine activities. Second, the activity of these
agents has been limited to the improvement of constitutional symptoms and reductions in spleen size, with nearly
negligible activity in other clinical manifestations of
MPNs such as cytopenia, JAK2V617F allele burden, or
bone marrow fibrosis. Finally, although active, these
agents have yet to prove that they can change the natural
history of MPNs, particularly of those such as PV or ET,
in which the median survival for certain subsets of patients
approaches that of matched aged controls. These questions notwithstanding, the clinical activity demonstrated
by JAK2 inhibitors in MPNs holds great promise and
brings great excitement to the field of MPN research,
which for decades has been in desperate need of novel
active therapies.
