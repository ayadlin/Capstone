ABSTRACT
Treatment failure followed by relapse and metastasis in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer is often the result of acquired resistance to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. A cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated anti-apoptotic phenomenon
is responsible for the development of drug resistance. The underlying molecular
mechanism related to cisplatin resistance is still controversial, and a new strategy is
needed to counteract cisplatin resistance. We used a nonadhesive culture system to
generate drug-resistant spheres (DRSPs) derived from cisplatin-resistant H23 lung
cancer cells. The expressions of drug-resistance genes, properties of CSCs, and markers
of anti-apoptotic proteins were compared between control cells and DRSPs. DRSPs
exhibited upregulation of cisplatin resistance-related genes. Gradual morphological
alterations showing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenomenon and increased
invasion and migration abilities were seen during induction of DRSPs. Compared with
control cells, DRSPs displayed increased CSC and anti-apoptotic properties, greater
resistance to cisplatin, and overexpression of p-Hsp27 via activation of p38 MAPK
signaling. Knockdown of Hsp27 or p38 decreased cisplatin resistance and increased
apoptosis in DRSPs. Clinical studies confirmed that the expression of p-Hsp27 was
closely associated with prognosis. Overexpression of p-Hsp27 was usually detected
in advanced-stage patients with lung cancer and indicated short survival.
Summary: DRSPs were useful for investigating drug resistance and may provide a
practical model for studying the crucial role of p-Hsp27 in the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 axis in
CSC-mediated cisplatin resistance. Targeting this axis using siRNA Hsp27 may provide
a treatment strategy to improve prognosis and prolong survival in lung cancer patients.

either small cell lung carcinoma or non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) [1]. An aggressive type of lung
cancer, NSCLC accounts for about 85% of lung cancer
and is associated with poor prognosis and a low 5-year

survival rate [2]. Cancer recurrence followed by relapse
and metastasis after therapy is the major cause of failure
of lung cancer treatment and probably results from
the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy [3]. It is thus
important to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the
generation of chemoresistance in NSCLC.
Platinum-based chemotherapy is used widely for
lung cancer treatment [4]. The most commonly used
drug for chemotherapeutic administration in lung cancer,
cisplatin, is a platinum compound that crosslinks DNA
to induce apoptosis of tumor cells [5]. Cisplatin-based
chemotherapy reduces the risk of death from NSCLC by
about 5% and has been reported to increase the 5-year
survival after complete resection by 4.1% [6]. However,
previous studies of lung cancer have demonstrated the
existence of cisplatin resistance [7], which may lead to
treatment failure. The recent National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines recommend the use of
cisplatin-based chemotherapy with or without targeted
therapy for advanced NSCLC [8]. However, drug
resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy inevitably
develops. Despite the association of cisplatin resistance
with a poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer, oral
cancer, or lung cancer [9-11], the current understanding of
the molecular mechanism remains contradictory.
The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) was
raised decades ago based on the similarities between
cancer cells and normal stem cells [12]. The existence
of CSCs was first described in the context of leukemia
[13]. The CSC hypothesis suggests that CSCs comprise
a small population of cells among the tumor cells and
possess ability for tumor formation and self-renewal
[14]. Accumulating evidence suggests that CSCs can
cause cancer relapse and metastasis, and can contribute
to the resistance of tumors to chemotherapy [15]. Despite
the link between the induction of CSCs in tumor cells,
acquisition of drug resistance, and recurrence of tumors,
the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are generally induced
by environmental stress and function as molecular
chaperones that are responsible for maintaining the
correct conformation of other proteins. Hsps are
classified into high-molecular-weight Hsps, such as
Hsp90 and Hsp70, and low-molecular-weight Hsps,
including Hsp27 [16]. In addition to its conventional
function as a chaperone, Hsp27 has been reported to
be overexpressed in breast cancer, ovarian cancer,
and head and neck cancer [17-19]. The expression of
Hsp27 appears to be associated with the prognosis and
survival rate of patients with different cancers. Hsp27
is thought to be associated with chemoresistance and
induction of tumor cells with stem cell-like properties
in breast cancer and head and neck cancer. However,
the involvement of Hsp27 in lung cancer is not fully
understood and merits further study.

Our research team has previously established a novel
nonadhesive sphere culture system that allows us to purify
and enrich a population of oral squamous cell carcinoma
cells with stem cell-like properties [20, 21]. Using this
established technique to generate drug-resistant spheres
(DRSPs), we aimed to identify the possible molecular
role of phosphorylated Hsp27 (p-Hsp27) and its related
signaling pathway in the control of apoptosis and drug
resistance. We performed a clinicopathological study using
immunohistochemical methods to study the relationships
between the immunoexpression of p-Hsp27 and clinical
parameters in samples from cisplatin-treated patients. Our
findings may provide insight into drug resistance and ideas
for new strategies against drug resistance, which may help
improve the prognosis and prolong survival of patients
with lung cancer.

RESULTS
Characterization of DR cells showing
upregulation of drug-resistance genes, EMT
phenomenon, and increased migration and
invasion abilities
Considering that drug resistance following
chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer is a common
phenomenon, we aimed to establish a model to study
chemoresistance. We first established DR cells that were
derived from NSCLC H23 cells by applying multistep
cisplatin treatment at various concentrations (0, 25,
50, 75, and 100 μM). More than 20% of DR-H23 cells
were significantly maintained after cisplatin treatment at
various concentrations, as shown in an MTT assay (P <
0.05; Figure 1A). To study the role of DR-H23 cells in
cisplatin-resistant lung cancer, we used western blotting
to measure the expression of two important genes related
to drug resistance, ABCG-2 and MDR-1 [25, 26]. The
expression of these genes was upregulated significantly
in DR-H23 cells compared with control cells (Figure
1B). During induction with various concentrations of
cisplatin, there was a gradual transformation from an
epithelioid to a mesenchymal-like cellular phenotype,
suggestive of the EMT (Figure 1C). Further evaluation
by western blotting showed significant alterations in
EMT-representative markers, including decreased
expression of E-cadherin and increased expression of
vimentin, twist, and snail in DR-H23 cells compared
with control cells (Figure 1D). The EMT is involved in
cell mobility and progression other than morphological
transformation. Therefore, migration and invasion assays
were performed, and the results showed significantly
increased abilities in DR-H23 cells compared with
control cells (P < 0.05; Figure 1E).

exhibited a spheroid phenotype, which we termed DRSPs

Increasing evidence [27-29] suggests that the EMT
plays a role in both early invasion and late metastasis, and
that there is a link between CSCs and the EMT. We next

(Figure 2A). An MTT assay showed larger IC50 values
for cisplatin in DRSPs than in control cells. The results
of western blotting of the related drug-resistance genes,
ABCG-2 and MDR-1 showed that these two genes were
upregulated significantly in DRSPs compared with DRH23 and control cells (P < 0.05; Figure 2B). Because
CSCs contribute to drug resistance in lung cancer, we
aimed to elucidate the role of CSCs in the resistance of
lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Immunofluorescence and
western blotting assays revealed that CSC-representative
markers, including CD44high/CD24low, CD133, Oct4, and
Nanog, were overexpressed in DRSPs compared with
DR-H23 and control cells (Figure 2C). Flow cytometry
was used to analyze another important CSC-representative
marker, ALDH1 [30, 31], and showed a significant
increase in ALDH1 activity in DRSPs compared with DRH23 and control cells (P < 0.05; Figure 2D).

from 22 representative pulmonary adenocarcinoma
patients with a history of cisplatin treatment whose
detailed clinical data were available. Each individual
case was reevaluated using routine hematoxylin and
eosin (HE) and immunohistochemical stains for TTF-1
and Napsin A. All samples were strongly or moderately
immunoreactive to TTF-1 and Napsin A, which confirmed
the diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (Figure 4A).
The immunoexpression of p-Hsp27 varied according to
the tumor characteristics. The expression of p-Hsp27
correlated significantly with the histological grade, tumor
size, nodal involvement, metastatic status, and survival
(Table 1). A strong p-Hsp27 expression with relatively
high immunoscore was associated with poor prognosis
in terms of nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and
overall survival. By contrast, a weak intensity of p-Hsp27
expression with relatively low immunoscore was usually
detected in patients with relatively low-grade cancer or
non-advanced cancer (Figure 4B). Kaplan–Meier survival
analysis of the relationship between the immunoexpression
of p-Hsp27 and overall patient survival after a 60-month
follow-up showed that p-Hsp27 expression correlated
inversely with overall survival (P = 0.01). In other words,
the stronger the p-Hsp27 expression, the shorter the
overall survival in patients with lung cancer (Figure 4C).

Involvement of the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 antiapoptotic pathway in DRSPs
Because of the close relationship between
chemoresistance and Hsps, especially Hsp27 and Hsp70,
the two most important Hsps, we wondered which of these
Hsps might be involved in our model of drug resistance
and anti-apoptosis. Immunofluorescence and western
blotting assays showed increased expression of p-Hsp27
compared with p-Hsp70. Western blotting showed no
obvious differences in the expression of Hsp27 and Hsp70
between DRSPs and control cells (Figure 3A). Because
the action of Hsp27 is initiated by p38 MAPK signalingmediated phosphorylation [32], we measured the levels of
p-Hsp27 and p38 in DRSPs. As shown in Figure 3B, the
phosphorylation of Hsp27 and p38 was increased in DRSPs
compared with control cells. However, expression of the
downstream-related apoptotic proteins Cl-caspase 3 and
Cl-PARP was markedly decreased in DRSPs (Figure 3C).
Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression of
p-Hsp27 markedly reduced cisplatin resistance in DRSPs.
Knockdown of Hsp27 expression induced the apoptosis of
DRSPs, as shown by the activation of caspase 3 and PARP.
Repression of Hsp27 did not affect the phosphorylation
of p38 in DRSPs, which indicated a downstream role of
Hsp27 in p38 MAPK signaling (Figure 3D). However,
knockdown of p38 in DRSP cells decreased downstream
p-Hsp27 expression and increased the resulting number
of apoptotic events (Figure 3E). Collectively, the above
results suggest that the cisplatin resistance of DRSPs
results from the activation of the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 axis.

DISCUSSION
Pulmonary adenocarcinoma, one of the most
common NSCLCs, is a major cause of cancer death
throughout the world. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is
used widely to improve the prognosis and survival rate
after clinical treatment of advanced lung cancer, especially
in patients with stage II or higher cancer. Targeted therapy
to prolong the survival is regarded as another choice of
treatment for stage IV patients with mutation of candidate
gene(s), such as EGFR or ALK [33]. Unfortunately,
cisplatin resistance is a major cause of tumor recurrence
or metastasis that leads to the failure of clinical treatment
and poor survival. Thus, finding new methods to address
this treatment dilemma associated with drug resistance has
become important in the clinical management of patients
with NSCLC. Better understanding of the mechanism
underlying chemoresistance is crucial to finding new
treatment strategies for advanced lung cancer. A review
of the literature has shown that chemoresistance during
chemotherapy is ultimately controlled by CSCs within
tumors [34]; in other words, CSCs are responsible
for the development of resistance to chemotherapy
[15]. For this purpose, we used a nonadhesive sphere
culture system to isolate lung cancer cells with stem
cell properties from cisplatin-resistant cells, which we
term DRSPs, as previously described in oral cancer
[21]. During the process of induction of DR-H23 cells
from lung cancer cells using various concentrations
of cisplatin, we observed the gradual morphological

phenotype. This so-called EMT was initially discovered
in studies of embryonic tissue migration [35, 36]. The
EMT phenomenon is known to be involved in cancer

progression and is closely associated with the “stemness”
of cancer cells [27, 28]. As shown in Figure 1C and 1D,
the isolated surviving DR cells were identified by the
alterations in EMT-representative markers, including

decreased expression of E-cadherin, increased expression
of vimentin and two main EMT regulators, twist and snail,
and significant increases in the migration and invasion
abilities compared with control cells.
To study the role of “stemness”, we used a
nonadhesive sphere culture system to generate DRSPs.
Sphere formation indicated the capability for selfrenewal, one of the most important properties of CSCs.
Upregulation of the drug resistance-related genes
ABCG-2 and MDR-1 was found in DRSPs (Figure 2B).
The upregulation of these two genes that confer drug
resistance suggests that the DRSPs exhibited another
essential characteristic of CSCs, and provides evidence
to support the hypothesis that CSCs contribute to the
drug resistance of tumor cells [37]. Figure 2 shows that,

in addition to the increased ALDH1 activity shown
by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western

that DRSPs exhibited the essential properties of CSCs
and that these cells may provide a valid model for
studying the therapeutic resistance of cancer cells. It
will be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms
underlying the activation of these drug-resistance genes
and properties of CSCs in DRSPs and their significance
in cisplatin resistance.
Hsps are generally categorized into several different

and CSC formation in breast cancer, head and neck
cancer, and lung cancer [21, 38, 39]. In addition, Hsp27
function is controlled by posttranslational modifications
such as phosphorylation, for which p38 MAPK signaling
is responsible and which initiates Hsp27 function. Here,
we found results similar to those reported previously [21,
40]. That is, phosphorylation of either Hsp27 or p38–ERK
is increased in DRSPs; this suggests that the activation
of p-Hsp27 is triggered by the canonical p-p38–MAPK
cascade. Moreover, knockdown of Hsp27 expression
in DRSPs decreased cisplatin resistance and induced
apoptosis by activating caspase signaling. Taken together,
these findings suggest that p-Hsp27 plays an essential
role in cisplatin resistance in DRSPs. In accordance
with a previous study of the role of chemoresistance in
lung cancer cells [39], we propose that suppressing the
function of p-Hsp27 may provide a new treatment tool
for overcoming cisplatin resistance, based on its antiapoptotic effect. A diagrammatic illustration showing
our DRSP model developed to investigate the molecular
mechanisms underlying drug resistance to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy via p-Hsp27 is proposed in Figure 5.
Finally, to add a clinical viewpoint and to confirm the
significance of p-Hsp27 expression, we analyzed samples
from 22 representative cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma
patients with available clinical information. After

reconfirming each individual case of pulmonary
adenocarcinoma, we found that p-Hsp27 expression
correlated closely with prognosis (Figure 4). This
clinical significance of Hsp27 has also been suggested
in two reports involving gastric cancer patients [41, 42].
Comparative analysis showed that the expression of
p-Hsp27 correlated significantly with the histological
grade, tumor size, nodal involvement, metastatic status,
and patient survival (Table 1). A high p-Hsp27 expression
level was associated with poor prognosis in terms of nodal
involvement, distant metastasis, and overall survival.
In conclusion, our results provide insight into the
mechanism underlying drug resistance and demonstrate
that the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 axis plays an important role
in the CSC-mediated cisplatin resistance of lung cancer.
Targeting this axis using siRNA p-Hsp27 has potential as
a treatment strategy to improve prognosis in patients with
pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

chemotherapy is induced by p-Hsp27, which plays a critical role as an anti-apoptotic functional protein that inhibits the apoptotic proteins
Cl-caspase 3 and Cl-PARP, via the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 axis. This ultimately leads to anti-apoptotic activity and worse prognosis in patients
with lung cancer, as shown on the left. Use of siRNA Hsp27 may be a potential new treatment strategy to inhibit the p38 MAPK–Hsp27
signaling pathway, which may increase apoptosis and improve the prognosis, as shown on the right.

Tween 20(TBST), slides were incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibodies, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), Napsin A, and p-Hsp27 (sc-12359; 1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., CA. USA). After being rinsed in TBST,
slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with
biotinylated secondary antibody followed by streptavidin–
biotinylated–enzyme complex (streptABComplexes kit;
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Subsequently, they were stained
with 0.003% 3, 3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride,
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted.

Western blotting analysis
Whole cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis
on 12% SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 h. The primary
antibodies were used: Hsp 27 (Santa Cruz; sc-1049; 1:1000),
p-Hsp27(Santa Cruz; sc-12359; 1:1000), GAPDH (ab9482;

Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining

and survivorship. Mayo Clin Proc. 2008; 83:584-594.

The histopathological slides of all the specimens
were reviewed concurrently and evaluated independently
by two well-trained pathologists using the same type of
microscope without any prior knowledge of each patient’s
clinical details. Firstly, all the study cases of pulmonary
adenocarcinomas included are initially identified by
histology and further confirmed immunohistochemically
with reactivity to two common representative biomarkers
for primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 and
Napsin A [22]. To precisely and objectively evaluate the
intensity of p-Hsp27, we used a Zeiss AxioImager-Z1
microscope to take pictures of all slides and measured
the intensity of the marker using Program Metamorph
software. The intensities of the immunoreactivity of tumor
cells were scored into three standardized categories: 0 (no
staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining) and
3 (strongest intensity). To measure the distributions of
p-Hsp27, we used Adobe Photoshop CS5 to measure the
distribution of the marker as a percentage of the positively
stained tumour cells (from 0 to 100) in each section of
the total tumour volume. A value of 10% or higher for
positively stained tumor cells was considered a positive
reaction. To compare the expressions for each case, the
percent of positive cells at each level of intensity was
multiplied by the corresponding intensity (from 0 to 3) to
obtain an immunoreactivity score ranging from 0 to 300
as described in our previous report [23, 24].
