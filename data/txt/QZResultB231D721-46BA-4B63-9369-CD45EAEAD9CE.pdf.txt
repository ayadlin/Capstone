BACKGROUND: UroVysion is a US Food and Drug Administration–approved fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set for use in the detection of recurrent urothelial carcinoma and in patients with hematuria. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the usefulness of UroVysion as a reflex test in
patients with a suspicious urine cytology diagnosis. The rationale was that a more aggressive workup might
be indicated in patients with a suspicious cytology diagnosis and positive UroVysion test. METHODS: The
study population included 161 urine specimens diagnosed as suspicious over a period of 12 months. The
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (NPV) were calculated
based on the histologic and cystoscopic correlation. RESULTS: The results using the reporting criteria suggested by the manufacturer demonstrated a sensitivity of 68.3%, a specificity of 39.7%, a PPV of 56.8%,
and a NPV of 51.9%. The results using the presence of any cytogenetic abnormality as a positive FISH test
demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.9%, a specificity of 21.7%, a PPV of 54.8%, and an NPV of 51.7%. CONCLUSIONS: A negative UroVysion test did not rule out the presence of low-grade or high-grade urothelial carcinoma in urine specimens diagnosed as suspicious. The use of less strict criteria dramatically increased the
sensitivity of UroVysion FISH; however, there was a marked decrease in specificity noted. The results in this
current study appear to indicate that a more aggressive workup of patients with a suspicious cytology,
positive UroVysion result, and negative cystoscopic evaluation is not currently justified. Cancer (Cancer

Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide1 and the fourth most common cancer
diagnosed in men in the US. An estimated 68,810 new cases and 14,100 deaths are expected to occur in
2008, according to the American Cancer Society.2 Urothelial carcinoma constitutes >90% of all bladder
cancers in developed countries.1,3,4 For all stages combined, the 5-year survival rate is 80%. Cystectomies
are usually indicated in patients with a pathologic stage greater than pT2 as an attempt to prevent the
development of metastatic disease, whereas patients with superficial disease are mostly treated locally by
either transurethral resection or intravesical therapy.3,5

Patients with superficial disease are usually entered
in a surveillance protocol to detect recurrence, progression, and/or metastatic disease because urothelial carcinoma has a high recurrence rate (up to 70%).3 The most
accepted surveillance protocol consists of follow-up every
3 months for the first 2 years, follow-up every 6 months
for the next 2 years, and annual follow-up evaluation
thereafter.5 Cystoscopy and urine cytology represent the
standard of care in the surveillance of urothelial carcinoma
despite their limitations.5,6 Cytology reportedly has a
high specificity but poor sensitivity for urothelial carcinomas, particularly low-grade urothelial carcinomas.3,6-8
Cystoscopy, which is considered the gold standard in the
diagnostic evaluation of urothelial carcinomas, is an excellent diagnostic tool for papillary urothelial lesions, but it
has a reported lower sensitivity for flat carcinoma in
situ.8,9 In addition, cystoscopy is an invasive and costly
procedure.
Several urine-based ancillary tests have been developed in an attempt to overcome the limitations of urinary
cytology and cystoscopy. Some markers, such as BTA and
NMP-22, have demonstrated better sensitivity than cytology, but they have also demonstrated lower specificity.
They also were found to have a relative high number of
false-positive cases when associated with inflammation or
hematuria.5,7,8,10 Molecular tests have also been developed to evaluate urine specimens because our knowledge
of the genetic alterations of urothelial carcinomas has
increased dramatically in recent years.11-13 Homozygous
deletions of the p16 gene at 9p21 are 1 of the most common alterations in urothelial carcinoma.11-20 Increased
chromosomal instability and aneuploidy have also been
associated with the progression of urothelial carcinoma,11,21-24 with frequent alterations of a variety of
chromosomes, including chromosomes 1, 7, 9, 11, and
17. Sokolova et al25 described a multicolor, multitarget
interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay
(UroVysion; Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, Ill) in
2000. It is a test designed to detect aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and chromosomal loss in the 9p21
locus. The individual sensitivity for urothelial carcinomas
of the centromeric probes for chromosome 3, 7, and 17
was 73.7%, 76.2%, and 61.9%, respectively; the sensitivity of homozygous 9p21 deletion for urothelial carcinoma
was described as 28.6%.25 The combined sensitivity of
the 4 probes was reported to be 95%.26 UroVysion is

currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the detection of urothelial carcinoma in
patients with hematuria and for the surveillance of
patients with bladder cancer.
In view of the initially promising results of
the UroVysion test in the detection of bladder
tumors,25,27-30 we proposed to study UroVysion as a
reflex test for cases with suspicious urine cytology. This
approach is similar to that suggested by Yoder et al30
in their evaluation of equivocal urine specimens. The
hypothesis was that a patient with a suspicious cytology
result and positive UroVysion test might benefit from a
more aggressive workup of the urinary tract and/or
closer follow-up, whereas patients with suspicious cytology diagnosis and a negative UroVysion result might
not require such an extensive workup.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study population consisted of patients whose urine
cytology specimens were diagnosed as suspicious for urothelial carcinoma over a period of 12 months. In our institution, urine specimens are collected and immediately
fixed in Cytolit after collection. Papanicolaou-stained
ThinPrep (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, Mass) or
Cytospin (Block Scientific Inc) slides are prepared, and
the diagnosis is given based on a 4-tier classification system (negative, atypical, suspicious, or positive categories)
by a team of 6 board-certified cytopathologists. Cases
with unequivocal benign or malignant cytologic findings
are included either in the negative or positive categories,
respectively. An atypical diagnosis is reserved for cases in
which despite the presence of atypical cells, we strongly
favored the changes to be associated with a benign, reactive, or post-treatment process. Suspicious diagnoses are
rendered in cases in which the suspicion of malignancy is
very high, but the number and/or cytomorphologic
changes of the atypical cells precluded a definitive positive
diagnosis (Fig. 1).
Once a suspicious diagnosis was rendered, the
remaining specimen was sent to a cytogenetics service for
UroVysion testing within 24 to 48 hours. The test was
conducted using the instructions in the package insert of
the UroVysion Bladder Cancer kit using a new set of slides
prepared from the remaining urine. The UroVysion result
was interpreted as positive or negative according to the

manufacturer’s criteria. A case was considered positive if it
satisfied 1 of the following criteria: 1) multiple chromosomal gains (>2) of chromosomes 3, 7, or 17 in at least 4
cells; or 2) homozygous loss of 9p21 (p16 gene) in at least
12 cells. In addition, the detailed cytogenetic findings in
all cases were recorded.
The UroVysion results were correlated with concurrent or follow-up biopsies and cystoscopy findings. All
patients underwent 1 cystoscopic evaluations, which
were concurrent with the collection of the urine specimen
in question or as part of the follow-up of a suspicious diagnosis. Histologic diagnosis was provided by an independent team of pathologists with expertise in uropathology.
The diagnosis was based on the current World Health
Organization classification.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
(PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were initially
calculated based on the manufacturer’s criteria for a positive or negative result. Among the diagnostic cases, there
were 4 categories: 1) true-negative cases: negative UroVysion result and negative biopsy or cystoscopic follow-up
(Fig. 2); 2) false-negative cases: negative UroVysion and
positive biopsy or cystoscopic follow-up (Fig. 3); 3) falseCancer Cytopathology

positive cases: positive UroVysion and negative biopsy or
cystoscopic follow-up (Fig. 4); and 4) true-positive cases:
positive UroVysion and positive biopsy or cystoscopic
follow-up (Fig. 5). True-positive results were cases that
had histologic or cystoscopic confirmation of carcinoma
within 1 year of the UroVysion test. A similar analysis was
performed with modified criteria that considered the presence of any cytogenetic abnormality to be a positive result,
regardless of the number of cells with cytogenetic
abnormalities.

RESULTS
The patient population included 140 different patients
represented by 128 men and 33 women ranging in age
from 26 to 92 years (mean age, 69 years). The urine specimens included 129 voided urine and 32 instrumented
urine specimens. A total of 161 specimens were diagnosed
as suspicious and sent for UroVysion testing during this
period. Ten cases were excluded because of an insufficient
number of cells for FISH analysis.
The UroVysion results and correlation with the
histologic diagnosis or cystoscopic findings are shown in

Table 1. The carcinomas were all confirmed histologically
or cystoscopically during subsequent follow-up. All
patients had at least 1 follow-up cystoscopic examination
after the UroVysion test, with a mean follow-up of 6.3
months. Ninety-five cases had a positive UroVysion result;
however, only 54 of these 95 cases demonstrated the presence of carcinoma at a follow-up biopsy or cystoscopy.
Conversely, 25 of 52 cases with a negative UroVysion test
based on the manufacturer’s criteria demonstrated the
presence of carcinoma. On the basis of these results,
the sensitivity was 68.3% and the specificity was 39.7%.
The NPV was 51.9% and the PPV was 56.8 %.
Twenty-seven cases demonstrated cytogenetic
abnormalities that did not reach the threshold suggested

by the manufacturer to determine the result as positive. If
any cytogenetic abnormality was considered a positive
result, 122 cases demonstrated the presence of at least 1
cytogenetic abnormality in the cells evaluated, and 68 of
these cases were confirmed to have carcinoma at the time
of follow-up. Twenty-nine cases had no cytogenetic
abnormality detected by UroVysion; however, 14 cases of
these cases were found to have confirmed urothelial carcinoma at follow-up. The results applying these modified
criteria (in which any cytogenetic abnormality is considered a positive result) are listed in Table 2. The sensitivity
of UroVysion using these modified criteria increased from
68.3% to 82.9%, whereas the specificity with the modified criteria decreased from 39.7% to 21.7%. The PPV

gression or perform a full workup, including cystoscopy,
upper urinary tract evaluation, and radiologic studies.
However, this workup is inevitably expensive and
invasive.
In view of the promising initial results with the UroVysion test in the detection of bladder tumors,25,27-30 we
proposed evaluating its role in suspicious cases. Only suspicious cases were included in the current study in view of
the low incidence of high-grade urothelial carcinomas in
cases initially diagnosed as negative or atypical in our
institution (unpublished data). The low incidence of urothelial carcinomas in the negative and atypical diagnostic
categories suggested that UroVysion would not be a costeffective diagnostic tool in these categories. Cases with a

DISCUSSION
The most accepted surveillance protocol for urothelial
carcinoma consists of follow-up with cystoscopy in combination with cytology every 3 months for the first 2 years,
follow-up every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annual
follow-up evaluation thereafter.5 One frequent issue
encountered by the urologists is the diagnosis of ‘‘suspicious’’ urine cytology. The urologist might elect to wait 3
months to repeat the cytology at the risk of disease proCancer Cytopathology

positive cytology diagnosis were also excluded in view of
the high specificity of urine cytology, making it unnecessary to confirm it. The proposed approach draws similarities with that adopted in uterine cervix cytology, in which
the detection of high-risk human papillomavirus leads to
an invasive procedure (colposcopy).
The sensitivity of UroVysion for urothelial carcinoma using the manufacturer’s criteria (65%) in the current study is lower than initially reported in the literature
by Sokolova et al, Halling et al, and Sarosdy et al.25,27-30
These authors reported a sensitivity between 81% and
84%. Interestingly, Moonen et al and Frierich et al also
later reported a lower sensitivity for UroVysion. The sensitivities obtained by these 2 groups were 39% and 69%,
respectively.9,31 The difference in results may be attributed to the handling of samples and patient selection. It is
interesting to note that the sensitivity of UroVysion
increased to 82.9% when the presence of any cytogenetic
abnormality was considered a positive result; however,
there was a marked decrease in specificity from 39.7% to
21.7%.
The results of the current study do not support the
value of UroVysion as a confirmatory test in cases with
suspicious urine cytology in view of the low PPV obtained
using either the manufacturer’s criteria or the modified
criteria. Forty-one of 95 cases with a positive UroVysion
result according to the manufacturer’s criteria did not
demonstrate the presence of carcinoma (PPV of 56.8%).
These patients had at least 1 follow-up cystoscopic examination after the UroVysion test, with a mean follow-up of
6.3 months. Yoder et al reported that 63% of patients
with a positive UroVysion test developed urothelial carcinoma within 29 months30; therefore, it is conceivable that
the PPV would be higher if the patients were followed for

a longer period of time. Nonetheless, the results of the
current study appear to indicate that a more aggressive
workup of patients with a positive UroVysion result, suspicious cytology, and negative cystoscopic evaluation is
not currently justified.
It has been previously suggested that a false-negative
UroVysion result represents mostly low-grade papillary
urothelial lesions that do not shed neoplastic cells into the
urine or do not exhibit the chromosomal changes that are
detected by the test.30 The results of the current study,
conversely, demonstrated that 29 patients with histologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma had a negative
UroVysion test (NPV of 51.9%), including 6 low-grade
papillary urothelial carcinomas, 4 high-grade papillary
urothelial carcinomas, 9 flat carcinomas in situ, and 8
invasive urothelial carcinomas. These findings suggest
that negative UroVysion results should not be used to rule
out high-grade urothelial carcinoma, or that only patients
with positive UroVysion results should be considered for
cystoscopy, as suggested by Bubendorf et al.32
Possible explanations given for the higher number
of false-negative UroVysion results noted in the current
study might be attributed to the low number of neoplastic
cells present in the specimen. Although previous studies
have demonstrated that the sensitivity of UroVysion outperformed cytology in all stages and grades of disease,28,32
UroVysion depends on the presence of an adequate number of abnormal cells in the urine specimens. The
minimum requirement of cells established by the manufacturer in the initial studies may not be a practical cutoff
number in a diagnostic category in which the number of
atypical cells might be scant. For this reason, we also analyzed the UroVysion results using modified criteria, in
which any cytogenetic abnormality was considered a

positive result. Even with this approach, the NPV demonstrated only a minimal change, from 51.9% to 51.7%.
Another possible explanation for the low NPV of
UroVysion in the current study is the finding that we used
the remainder of the specimen for the UroVysion study.
This approach is different from that used by Halling
et al,28 in which they used the same ThinPrep slide for the
cytology as well as for UroVysion evaluation. We elected
not to use the same slide because of logistic and legal concerns. In our institution, the UroVysion is performed at a
separate laboratory. As per Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act and Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations regulations, the cytology slides
must be maintained for 5 years. In addition, hypothetically, the cells or slides could be lost during UroVysion
processing. In our opinion, the results were not seriously
compromised with this approach because an adequate
number of cells were available for UroVysion analysis in
the large majority of cases.
In summary, a negative UroVysion result does not
rule out a high-grade urothelial carcinoma in the presence
of suspicious urine cytology. The use of less strict criteria
dramatically increases the sensitivity of UroVysion at the
expense of specificity. On the basis of these results, the
role of UroVysion in suspicious urine specimens remains
questionable, especially in view of its high cost. Cystoscopy remains the gold standard in the follow-up of
patients with urothelial carcinoma.
