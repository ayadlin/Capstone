ABSTRACT
Skp1 is an essential adaptor protein of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein complex and
is able to stabilize the conformation of some ubiquitin E3 ligases. However, the role
Skp1 plays during tumorigenesis remains unclear and Skp1-targeting agent is lacking.
Here we showed that Skp1 was overexpressed in 36/64 (56.3%) of non-small cell lung
cancers, and elevated Skp1 was associated with poor prognosis. By structure-based
high-throughput virtual screening, we found some Skp1-targeting molecules including
a natural compound 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP). 6-OAP bound Skp1 at sites critical
to Skp1-Skp2 interaction, leading to dissociation and proteolysis of oncogenic E3
ligases NIPA, Skp2, and β-TRCP, and accumulation of their substrates Cyclin B1, P27
and E-Cadherin. 6-OAP induced prometaphase arrest and exerted potent anti-lung
cancer activity in two murine models and showed low adverse effect. These results
indicate that Skp1 is critical to lung cancer pathogenesis, and Skp1 inhibitor inactivates
crucial oncogenic E3 ligases and exhibits significant therapeutic potentials.

breast and lung cancers, and is able to promote cancer cell
proliferation [3, 4, 5]. Many of the F box proteins function
as oncoproteins (e.g., Skp2, NIPA and β-TRCP) or tumor
suppressors (e.g., Fbxw7) [1, 2]. Skp2 is overexpressed in
human cancers [6] and is able to promote degradation of p27
[7] and activation of Akt, leading to cancer initiation and
progression [8, 9]. β-TRCP activates NFκB by mediating
ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα [10], and enhances
β-Catenin transcriptional activity [11]. Skp1 is the essential
adaptor protein linking the F-box protein and Cul1 [12, 13,

INTRODUCTION
The S phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1)–Cullin
1 (Cul1)–F-box protein (SCF) complexes are multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that promote the
ubiquitination and degradation of a large number of
regulatory proteins involved in diverse processes [1].
Accumulative evidence demonstrates that components
of SCF complexes play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis
[2]. For example, Cul1 is increased in melanoma and

structure-based high-throughput virtual screening. We
showed that Skp1 was overexpressed in 36/64 (56.3%)
of NSCLCs and was inversely associated with patients’
prognosis. We found some compounds that could bind
Skp1 at two pockets. Among these molecules, a natural
compound 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP) that was isolated
from a medicinal herb Centipeda minima, could bind and
sequester Skp1, resulting in dissociation and degradation
of Skp2, NIPA, and β-TRCP, but did not perturb the
expression of Fbxw7. 6-OAP showed potent in vitro and in
vivo anti-lung cancer activity with minimal adverse effect,
demonstrating the therapeutic potentials of Skp1 inhibitors.

14, 15]. However, the expression of Skp1 and its roles in
carcinogenesis remain largely unknown.
Some F-box proteins have been shown to be
rational targets for the treatment of human cancers. For
example, Skp2 targeting suppresses tumorigenesis [16]
and induces apoptosis of cancer cells [17]. Compounds
which inhibit Skp2-mediated p27 degradation promote
cell-type specific blockage in the G1 or G2/M phases
[18, 19, 20]. Compound #25 [21] binds Skp2 and prevents
Skp2-Skp1 interaction, leading to the inhibition of Skp2
activity and suppression of cancer stem cells. Inhibition
of β-TRCP suppresses breast cancer cells [22], while
elevation of Fbxw7 reverses resistance to chemotherapies
[23]. However, whether Skp1 could serve as a therapeutic
target is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that Skp1
could be a potential target, because it is a prerequisite for
the functions of some oncogenic E3 ligases including
Skp2 [24], Fbxo44 [25], Fbxo6, Fbxo1717, Fbxo27 [26]
and the nuclear interaction partner of ALK (NIPA) that
targets cyclin B1 for ubiquitination during interphase and
prevents premature mitotic entry [27, 28, 29].
In this study, we assessed the expression of Skp1
in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and screened
for Skp1 inhibitors in a total of 21,008 compounds by

RESULTS
Skp1 is overexpressed and inversely associated
with prognosis in lung cancer
We tested the expression of Skp1 in 64 previously
untreated NSCLCs (Table 1) by Western blot (Figure 1A,
1B) and immunohistochemistry (Figure 1C, 1D), and
showed that in 36 (56.3%) of the patients the expression of
Skp1 was significantly higher in tumor samples than their

adjacent normal lung tissues. The densitometry analyses of
the Western blot bands and the immunoreactivity score of
immunohistochemistry confirmed the elevation of Skp1 in
tumor samples (Figure 1B, 1D). Importantly, patients with
higher levels of Skp1 had much shorter overall survival than
those with lower Skp1 expression ( p = 0.01; Figure 1E).

kcal/mol were further filtered by the Lipinski’s rule of
five drug-like property [33] and ADME/Tox prediction,
resulting in identification of 28 lead compounds
(Figure  S1D, Table S1). We tested the effects of these
compounds on cancerous and normal lung epithelial cell
lines, and found that three natural compounds, liriodenine,
evodiamine, and 6-OAP had significant BAE to Skp1
and inhibitory effects on lung (A549, H1975 and H460),
gastric (BGC823), breast (MCF7), and liver (BEL7402)
cancer cell lines (Table S1). We tested the effects of these
3 compounds on cell cycle distribution, and found that
evodiamine and 6-OAP inhibited G2/M while liriodenine
inhibited G1 phase of synchronous and non-synchronous
A549 cells (Figure 1K). At protein level, these compounds
did not down-regulated the expression of Skp1.
Interestingly, 6-OAP down-regulate the expression of
Skp2 and NIPA, while evodiamine slightly suppressed the
expression of these two proteins (Figure 1L). We therefore
investigated the mechanisms of action of 6-OAP on Skp1
and cell cycle inhibition.

Silencing Skp1 exerts inhibitory effects on lung
cancer cells
The potential role of Skp1 in lung cancer was
evaluated by siRNA-mediated silencing in NSCLC lines
A549 and NCI-H1975 (harboring the L858R/T790M-EGFR)
[30], and the results showed that knockdown  of  Skp1
(Figure 1F) led to a significant inhibition of cell growth/
proliferation (Figure 1G) and suppression of colony forming
activity (Figure 1H, 1I) of the cells. We tested the effect of
Skp1 knockdown on cell cycle distribution, and found that in
asynchronous H1975 cells, siRNA-mediated Skp1 silencing
resulted in G2/M phase arrest (Figure 1J). These results
indicate that Skp1 is critical to lung cancer cell proliferation.

6-OAP is a Skp1 inhibitor

Structure-based high-throughput virtual
screening for Skp1 inhibitors

The computational docking results showed that
6-OAP could form two H-bonds with R136 and one
H-bond with N143, and closely contacted with E150 and
interacted with the hydrophobic residues at P2 of Skp1.
6-OAP could be docked onto the P1 pocket, forming two
H-bonds with Q97 and Pi-Pi interaction with F101, and
its hydrophobic group could form hydrophobic interaction
with residues in P1 pocket (Figure 2A). By interacting
with either the P1 or P2 pocket, 6-OAP could interfere
with the interaction between Skp2 and Skp1.
To confirm 6-OAP/Skp1 interaction, biotinylated
6-OAP (Bio-6-OAP, Figure 2B) was synthesized and
validated by mass spectrum (Figure S2) and nuclear
magnetic resonance, with a purity of 95% determined by
HPLC. The purified Skp1 protein was printed on slides and
incubated with Bio-6-OAP followed by treatment with a Cy3
conjugated streptavidin (Cy3-SA), and the Bio-6-OAP-Skp1
interaction was detected (Figure 2C). In Bio-6-OAP- treated
H1975 cells, Skp1 was pulled down by streptavidin agarose
(Figure 2D). The in vitro experiment showed that the binding
of Bio-6-OAP to Skp1 could be markedly attenuated by
unlabeled 6-OAP (Figure 2E), confirming the direct binding
of 6-OAP to Skp1.
Docking analysis suggested that residues Q97, N143,
R136 and E150 of Skp1 were involved in the binding with
6-OAP (Figure 2A). To confirm whether these residues were
critical for the 6-OAP interaction, site-directed mutagenesis
on Skp1 was performed, and plasmids containing wild
type (WT) or mutant Skp1 were transfected into A549
cells to purify Skp1 protein for in intro binding analysis.
We showed that while WT Skp1 strongly recruited 6-OAP,
Q97A mutation only slightly attenuated the binding affinity;
however, R136A, N143A, and E150A mutations drastically

We screened for specific Skp1 small molecule
inhibitors by structure-based high-throughput virtual
screening [31] using the Skp1 model from the crystal
structure of Skp1-Skp2-Cks1 in complex with a p27
peptide (PDB accession 2AST) [32] as the receptor in
the molecular docking. Two libraries were used for the
screening: library 1 contained 1008 natural compounds
and library 2 was a commercial library composed of
20,000  compounds. The poses docked to Skp1 were
clustered into two potential binding pockets (Figure S1A),
pocket 1 (P1; comprised of residues Q97, L100, F101,
I104, V123, F139 and I141; Figure S1B) and pocket 2
(P2; comprised of residues I135, R136, I141, N143, D144,
E150, V153 and N157; Figure S1C). P1 accommodates
the residue W97 while P2 accommodates the residues
from L114 to K125 of Skp2. Residue N143 of Skp1
forms an H-bond with V123 of Skp2 (mediated by a
water molecule), and N157 of Skp1 forms two H-bonds
with Ser121 and Leu118 of Skp2. When docked to site
P1, the interactions between ligands and Skp1 mainly
included H-bond with Q97, Pi stacking interaction with
F101 and F139, and hydrophobic interaction. When
docked to site P2, most compounds can form H-bond
with residues R136 and N143 in Skp1. Some compounds
can form additional H-bonds with other residues, such
as D144, F145, E150 and N157. Residue N143 of Skp1
forms an H-bond with V123 of Skp2 (mediated by a water
molecule), and N157 of Skp1 forms two H-bonds with
Ser121 and Leu118 of Skp2.
The binding affinity energy (BAE) of the compounds
to Skp1 was calculated, and compounds with BAE ≤ − 7.0

inhibited Skp1 from binding to 6-OAP (Figure 2F),
indicating that the P2 pocket of Skp1 is critical for 6-OAP
binding. Of note, treatment of A549 and H1975 cells with
6-OAP did not perturb the expression of Skp1 at protein
level (Figure 2G), suggesting that 6-OAP does not affect
Skp1 expression, but might sequestrate it and therefore
interfere with Skp1-F-box protein binding affinity.

with 6-OAP, Skp2 was down-regulated in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Figure 3B). On the contrary, two
substrate proteins of Skp2 which are involved in regulation
of G2-M progression, P27 [18] and E-cadherin [34],
were up-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent fashion
(Figure 3B). In H1975 cells, 6-OAP treatment suppressed
ubiquitination of E-cadherin (Figure 3C); in an in vitro
ubiquitination assay, 6-OAP inhibited Skp2-induced
ubiquitination of E-cadherin (Figure 3D). These results
indicate that Skp2 function is inhibited by 6-OAP.
We tested the effects of 6-OAP on other Skp1 binding
partners, and found that this compound perturbed the
Skp1-F-box protein interaction and dissociated β-TRCP
(Figure 3E) and Fbxw7 (Figure 3F), but did not affect
Skp1-Cul1 binding affinity (Figure 3G). In H1975 and
A549 cells, 6-OAP induced downregulation of β-TRCP
and up-regulation of its substrate protein IκBα, and did not
interfere with the expression of Fbxw7 and its substrates
Cyclin E, MCL-1 and C-Jun (Figure 3B).

6-OAP targets the SCFNIPA complex
Skp1 can bind and thus stabilize NIPA [28] which
ubiquitinates Cyclin B1 and regulates mitotic entry [27].
We examined whether or not 6-OAP could dissociate
Skp1-NIPA interaction by immunoprecipitation and
Western blot assays, and found that in H1975 cells
upon 6-OAP treatment, Skp1-NIPA binding affinity
was markedly reduced (Figure 2H, left panel); in 293T
cells transfected with Flag-NIPA, 6-OAP also markedly
suppressed Skp1-NIPA interaction (Figure 2H, right panel).
We showed that in A549 and H1975 cells, 6-OAP caused
down-regulation of NIPA in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 2I). In an in vitro ubiquitination assay,
we showed that SCFNIPA was able to ubiquitinate Cyclin
B1, while 6-OAP treatment inhibited this effect (Figure
2J). We then examined the kinetics of mitotic entry and
NIPA expression in A549 cells exposed to 6-OAP. To do
this, A549 cells were synchronized at G1/S boundary site
by thymidine treatment. We showed that the cells entered
into mitosis in 8 h, and the 6-OAP-treated cells arrested in
M phase while untreated cells exited in 12 h (Figure 2K,
left panel). Accordingly, NIPA was down-regulated while
Cyclin B1 was up-regulated in cells treated with 6-OAP for
12 h (Figure 2K, right panel). When the expression of NIPA
was reduced to approximately 50% by 6-OAP treatment or
NIPA-specific siRNA, approximately equal proportion (25%
versus 22%) of the cells were arrested at M phase; when
NIPA was down-regulated by about 90% by combinatory
treatment, 60% of the cells were arrested at M phase
(Figure 2L). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that both
6-OAP treatment and NIPA knockdown induced mitotic
arrest (Figure 2M). These results suggested that 6-OAP
dissociated NIPA from Skp1 and triggered its proteolysis,
leading to accumulation of Cyclin B1 in lung cancer cells.

Skp1 expression is associated with the 6-OAP
sensitivity of the cells
We tested the effects of 6-OAP on 21 cancer cell
lines (including lines of lung, liver, gastric, breast,
kidney cancers, leukemia, and myeloma) and 2 normal
cell lines (16HBE and HLF) by MTT assay, and found
that 6-OAP inhibited the proliferation of these cell
lines with the GI50s ranged from 2.29 to 9.31 μM
(Table  S2, Figure S3A), and the Bio-6-OAP retained
the proliferation inhibition activity (Figure S3B). To
assess the potential association between the Skp1
expression and the sensitivity of the cells to 6-OAP,
the Western blot was performed (Figure S3C) and
the densitometry analysis of Western blot bands was
conducted to evaluate the relative Skp1 expression:
Relative Skp1 expression=Skp1/β-Actin (Table S2).
The logistic regression analysis was performed, and
the results showed that Skp1 expression was associated
with 6-OAP sensitivity of the cells (R = -0.6, p = 0.003,
Figure 4A). 6-OAP also significantly inhibited the
growth (Figure S3D) and clonogenic activity of A549
and H1975 cells (Figure 4B).

6-OAP arrests mitosis at prometaphase in lung
cancer cells

The 6-OAP binding sites in Skp1 located in
the core part of Skp1-Skp2 interface [24]. We tested
whether or not 6-OAP dissociated Skp2 from Skp1 by
co-immunoprecipitation, and found that in A549 cells,
Skp1-Skp2 binding affinity was high, while 6-OAP
dramatically attenuated this interaction and released Skp2
(Figure 3A). We assessed the expression of Skp2 at protein
level, and found that in H1975 and A549 cells treated

Cell cycle distribution was analyzed in
double-thymidine synchronized cells, and the results
showed that treatment with 6-OAP at 5 to 10 μM for 12 h
accumulated A549 and H1975 cells in G2/M phase (Figure
4C). 6-OAP also arrested cell cycle at G2/M phase in
asynchronous cells (Figure 4C). G2/M phase blockade was
also seen in Bio-6-OAP treated cells (Figure S3E–S3G).

were analyzed. We showed that 6-OAP up-regulated
pH3 and cyclin B1 and down-regulated the tyrosine15-phosphorylated Cdc2 (pCdc2 (Y15)) in A549 and
H1975 cells (Figure 4D), indicating that 6-OAP arrests
lung cancer cells in an early stage of mitosis. However,
6-OAP did not interfere with polymerization of tubulins

staining of microtubule and chromosome, and found
that 6-OAP treatment for 12 h significantly increased
prometaphase cells characterized by bipolar spindle
assembly and chromosome compression, with a number
of chromosomes remained at the poles and did not align

treated with 6-OAP for 12 hours. We found that in
A549 cells, 6-OAP downregulated NIPA and Skp2 and
upregulated Cyclin B1, and arrested cell cycle at G2/M
phase. Transfection of Skp1 antagonized these effects
(Figure 4H). These results were also observed in 293T
cells (Figure 4I), demonstrating the roles of Skp1 in
6-OAP-induced mitotic arrest.

as NFκB [10] and β-Catenin [11], promoting malignant
transformation of lung epithelial cells.
We aimed to identify Skp1 inhibitors and evaluate
their therapeutic potentials, and found some compounds
that could bind Skp1 at P1 and P2 pockets by H-bonds,
Pi stacking interactions, and hydrophobic interactions
(Figure S1). The representative three molecules
(evodiamine, 6-OAP, and liriodenine) exhibited moderate
to potent cytotoxicity against several cancer cell
lines. These compounds perturbed the expression of
oncogenic E3 ligases NIPA and Skp2, but did not affect
Skp1 expression (Figure 1). 6-OAP is extracted from a
medicinal herb Centipeda minima (L.) which is rich
in many countries including China and Korea [37]. We
showed that 6-OAP could bind Skp1 mainly at P2 pocket,
with R136, N143 and E150 as the direct binding amino
acids. This region locates in the core part of Skp1-Skp2
interface [24], and Skp1–6-OAP interaction competitively
dissociated E3  ligases Skp2, NIPA, and β-TRCP from
Skp1 (Figures 2 and 3). Skp1 is able to stabilize the
conformation of NIPA [28] and other F-box proteins
[26], whereas sequestration of Skp1 by 6-OAP induced
proteolysis of NIPA, Skp2 and β-TRCP, and up-regulation
of their substrate proteins Cyclin B1, P27, E-Cadherin,
and IκBα (Figure 2, 3 and 5L). Interestingly, 6-OAP did
not interfere with Skp1-Cul1 interaction, while Fbxw7
was dissociated but not subsequently degraded and its
oncogenic substrates Cyclin E, MCL-1 and C-JUN were
not up-regulated (Figure 3). The mechanism underlying
these observations remains an open question.
Mitosis is a complex process in actively
proliferating cells, resulting in the division of a cell into
two genetically identical daughter cells. In eukaryocytes,
the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) attaches ubiquitin
to cyclin B1 [38, 39], and the proteasomal degradation
of cyclin B1 can be inhibited by the spindle-assembly
checkpoint (SAC) which is comprised of checkpoint
proteins including Bub1, BubR1/Mad3, Bub3, Mad1
and Mad2 [40]. Huang et al [41] showed that blocking
mitotic exit by silencing Cdc20, a co-factor of APC,
slowed Cyclin B1 proteolysis and thus allowed more
time for death initiation. Sackton et al [42] recently
showed that simultaneously disrupting the protein–protein
interactions within the APC/C–Cdc20–substrate ternary
complex could synergistically inhibit APC/C-dependent
proteolysis and mitotic exit. We previously reported
that 6-OAP induced BubR1 assemble and enhanced the
binding affinity between Mad2 and Cdc20, but the role
APC played in 6-OAP-induced mitotic arrest remained
unclear since 6-OAP was unable to directly target APC
or SAC component [43]. In this study, we showed that
6-OAP inactivated NIPA and accumulated Cyclin B1 in
lung cancer cells (Figure 2). In HeLa cells, the mitotic
block upon NIPA knockdown was presumably not cyclin
B related, but rather a result of the accumulation of other
yet-to-be-identified NIPA targets [27]. In myeloma cells,

In vivo anti-lung cancer activity of 6-OAP
In nude mice (n = 10 for each group) subcutaneously
inoculated with H1975 cells (2 × 106), intraperitoneal
injection of 6-OAP at 10 to 20 mg/kg (once per day for
24 days) significantly inhibited tumor growth (Figure 5A
and 5B), but did not reduce body weight of the mice (Figure
S3I). 6-OAP treatment did not perturb Skp1 expression,
but down-regulated NIPA and Skp2, and up-regulated
Cyclin B1 and E-cadherin in tumor samples (Figure 5C).
In SCID/Beige mice n=6 for control group and n=12 for
6-OAP treatment group injected with A549-luciferase cells
(1 × 106), 20 mg/kg 6-OAP (intravenously injection, once
every two days for 30 days) significantly suppressed tumor
growth reflected by decrease of luciferase bioluminescence
intensity (Figure 5D, 5E). 6-OAP reduced dissemination
of disease and prevented destruction of tissue architectures
(Figure 5F), and prolonged life span of the mice (Figure 5G).
6-OAP also induced downregulation of NIPA and Skp2 and
up-regulation of Cyclin B1 in tumor samples (Figure 5H).
We tested the adverse effects of 6-OAP,
and showed that normal Kunming mice receiving
intravenously injection of 6-OAP at 225–600 mg/kg
survived during one week’s observation, and did not
show body weight loss (Figure 5I). These mice had
normal serum concentrations of aminotransferase (AST)
and creatinine (CR) (Figure 5J, 5K).

DISCUSSION
Recent studies have uncovered the important roles of
SCF complex components in carcinogenesis. For example,
overexpressed Cul1 promotes cancer cell proliferation
and predicts poor prognosis, while alterations in the Cul1
neddylation/deneddylation pathway contributes to the
development of highly aggressive lung tumors [36, 3,
4, 5]. Oncogenic E3 ligases promote degradation of tumor
suppressors and contribute to uncontrolled proliferation,
genomic instability, and malignant transformation [2].
Here we showed that Skp1 was overexpressed in lung
cancers and was inversely associated with clinical outcome
(Figure 1), while knockdown of Skp1 resulted in inhibition
of cancer cell proliferation and clonogenic activity
(Figure 1). Skp1 is required for stabilization of some F-box
proteins [26, 28]. We showed that dissociation of NIPA,
Skp2 and β-TRCP from Skp1 led to their degradation
(Figure 2–4). Therefore, the elevated Skp1 might facilitate
oncogenic E3 ligases and their downstream molecules such

however, cyclin B1 silencing abrogated 6-OAP-induced
mitotic arrest [43]. Moreover, 6-OAP treatment dissociated
Skp2 from Skp1 and accumulated its substrates p27 [18]
and E-cadherin [34] which were involved in regulation
of G2-M progression [18] (Figures 3, 4). These results
suggest that cyclin B1, p27 and E-cadherin may play a

role in 6-OAP-induced prometaphase arrest (Figure 5L),
and other NIPA substrates critical to G2-M progression
need to be uncovered.

taxanes and vinca alkaloids remain to date the most reliable
antimitotics [44]. To bypass the adverse effects including
myelosuppression and neurotoxicities, novel targets for
the development of antimitotics have been investigated.
Evodiamine induced mitotic arrest and down-regulated
Skp2 and NIPA (Figure 1K, 1L), but it also induced
polymerization of tubulin [45]. 6-OAP did not interfere
with microtubule (Figure 4D), therefore its adverse effect
might be low, and our in vivo experiments confirmed this
possibility (Figure 5). 6-OAP significantly suppressed tumor
growth in two murine models for lung cancer (Figure 5), and
at a dose (600 mg/kg) 30 times higher than the treatment
dosage (20 mg/kg) it did not exhibit obvious acute toxicity
(Figure 5). 6-OAP also showed anti-myeloma activity with
low cytotoxicity and favorable pharmacokinetic features
[43]. Hence, Skp1-targeting represents a promising anticancer strategy. Because lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer
killer worldwide with an only 15% of five-year overall
survival rate for all stages combined [46], a clinical study
could be conducted to test 6-OAP’s efficacy for this deadly
disease. In addition, 6-OAP could be a useful tool to study
Skp1 function, since no Skp1 knockout mouse model is
available at present [47].

included 1008 natural compounds and 20000 commercially
available small compounds. The 3D structure models
of most natural compounds were downloaded from the
PubChem compound library. For the remaining natural
compounds, 3D models were converted from 2D structures
drawn in ChemDraw Ultra and followed by “Minimize
Energy” and “Molecule Dynamics” procedure in Chem3D
Ultra. The Skp1 model from the crystal structure of Skp1Skp2-Cks1 in complex with a p27 peptide (PDB accession
2AST) was used as the receptor in the molecular docking.
Virtual screening by rigid docking was carried out using
Autodock Vina [31]. Receptor and ligands were prepared
by AutoDock Tools [50] and OpenBabel [51], respectively.
The parameters exhaustiveness and num_modes were set
as 50 and 100, respectively. The compounds were also
analyzed by the Lipinski’s rule of five [33] and ADME/
Tox prediction using Schrödinger QikProp program [52].
6-OAP was isolated from medicinal plant Centipeda
minima by our chemistry group, and the purity of this
compound reached 99.5% [53]. Labeling of 6-OAP
was performed by Boshixing Synthetic Technologies,
Inc. (Shenzhen, China): biotin was condensed with
2-aminoethylthiol using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to
afford the corresponding amide, the thiol group of which
was added to the enone moiety of 6-OAP to provide the
desired biotinated 6-OAP. The identity of the compound
was verified using mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic
resonance, and the purity of biotin-6-OAP was determined
by HPLC.
The 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3, 5-di-­

Western blot and immunohistochemistry assays

exponentially growing cells (1 × 104 in 180 μl) were plated
in 96-well microplates, and 20 μl of 10 × drug was added
to each well. Cells were incubated with or without 6-OAP
for 44 h, followed by co-incubation with 100 μg MTT for
4 h. The microplates were centrifuged, supernatants were
removed, and MTT formazan crystals were resolubilized
by adding 150 μ1 dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to each
well. Microplates were then agitated on a plate shaker for
5 min, and absorbance was measured using a multiplate
reader at the wavelength of 570 nm [55]. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were synchronized to G1/S boundary by a
double-thymidine block [56], and then exposed to 6-OAP
for indicated time points. Cells were harvested, fixed with
70% cold ethanol, incubated with RNase, and stained
with propidium iodide [57]. Cell cycle distribution was
analyzed by flow cytometry and CellQuest software.
Asynchronous cells upon 6-OAP were also analyzed.
Clonogenic assay [48], immunofluorescence staining
[54] and analysis of cold-stable microtubules [35] were
performed as described.

For Western blot assay, tissue specimens were
ground in liquid nitrogen-cooled mortar, tissue powder
was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mM NaCl, 1% triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS ,1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor cocktail) and
cleared by centrifugation. Equal amounts of samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred on to nitrocellulose
and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.
Immunohistochemistry assay and scoring of
immunoreactivity were performed as described [58].
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue
specimens (5 μm) were deparaffinized and subjected to
a heat-induced epitope retrieval step for 2 min. The H2O2
(3%) was used to block endogenous peroxidase activity
for 10 min. The sections were then washed with PBS. The
rabbit polyclonal anti-Skp1 antibody was applied to the
slides at a dilution of 1:500 at 4°C overnight. Detection was
achieved with the Immunohistochemistry SP kit (pv-6001)
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co., Ltd,
Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Sections were colored with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
and counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, treated
with xylene, and mounted. Skp1 protein levels were
scored as described [49].

Plasmids, siRNA and transfection
The coding sequence of wild-type or mutant Skp1
and NIPA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1-flag expression
vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The siRNAs
targeting candidate genes were designed and synthesized
by Shanghai GenePharma Co., the siRNA sequences were
as follows: 5′-CGCAAGACCUUCAAUAUCATT-3′ (Skp1
siRNA1), 5′-CCAAUAUGAUCAAGGGGAATT-3′ (Skp1
siRNA2), and 5′-GUCCACGUCACUGCCUGUATT-3′
(NIPA siRNA). Using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
California, USA), A549 cells were transfected with 100 nM
siRNA. And 48 h later, the cells were treated with or without
6-OAP at 7.5 μM for indicated time points. The cells were
then harvested for cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence
staining, or lysed for Western blotting.

Murine models
The mice were bred and maintained in a specific
pathogen-free environment. The nude mice were injected
subcutaneously with H1975 cells (2 × 106) into the right
flank. When tumor reached a palpable size, animals were
randomized into 4 groups (n = 10 for each group) and
injected with 6-OAP (10, 15, 20 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (5%
Cremophor/5% Ethanol in normal saline) intravenously for
24 days. The animals were sacrificed after the last injection
and the tumors were excised; cells were separated and
lysed for Western blotting. SCID/beige mice were injected
with A549-luciferase (A549-Luc) cells (1 × 106) via tail
vein, and a week later the mice were randomized into
2 groups to receive treatment with intravenous injection
of vehicle (n = 6) or 6-OAP at 20 mg/kg (n = 8; once
every two days for 30 days). The mice were imaged by
IVIS Spectrum at day 40, and were euthanized by cervical
dislocation when they became moribund.
Kunming mice (5-week old) were randomized into
4 groups (n = 10 for each group) and injected with 6-OAP
(225, 375, and 600 mg/kg) or vehicle intravenously at the
first day. The body weights of the mice were measured
every day. One week later, the animals were sacrificed
and blood samples were collected. Serum was The serum
concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
creatinine (Cr) were measured using kits from Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China).

Immunoprecipitation and streptavidin agarose
affinity assay
Cell pellets were lysed, lysates were centrifuged,
the supernatant was incubated with indicated antibodies
overnight at 4°C, after which protein A/G Plus beads
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated at
4°C for 4 h. The beads were washed 4 times in NETN
buffer (1% NP-40, 2mM EDTA, 40 mM Tris-Hcl, 137mM
NaCl, pH 7.4), resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer
and boiled for 5 min. For Streptavidin agarose affinity
assay, cells upon Bio-6-OAP were lysed, the lysates were
incubated with streptavidin agarose, washed and boiled in
SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For 6-OAP competition, the
cell lysates were pretreated with 6-OAP (100 μM) for 1 h,
followed by 50 μM Bio-6-OAP treatment for 3 h at 4°C,
and streptavidin agarose affinity assay were performed.
Western blot assays were performed as described [54].
