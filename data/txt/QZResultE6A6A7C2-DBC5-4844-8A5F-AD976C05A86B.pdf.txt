ABSTRACT
Derlin-1 has been found to be overexpressed in several human cancers. However,
its clinical significance and biological roles in bladder cancer remain unexplored. Here,
we found that Derlin-1 was upregulated in 38.6% (58/150) cases of cancer samples.
The rate of Derlin-1 overexpression was higher in muscle invasive bladder cancer
(MIBC) than non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (p=0.0079). Derlin-1
was a predicting factor for poor patient prognosis. Derlin-1 depletion inhibited
while its overexpression facilitated cell invasion and colony formation. In addition,
Derlin-1 overexpression induced cisplatin resistance while its depletion sensitized
cancer cells to cisplatin. Further analysis demonstrated that Derlin-1 activated
AKT phosphorylation and upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Blockage of AKT signaling
by LY294005 abolished the effects of Derlin-1 on Bcl-2 and cisplatin resistance.
Immunoprecipitation indicated Derlin-1 interacted with p110α subunit of PI3K. In
addition, we showed that Derlin-1 depletion downregulated and its overexpression
upregulated cell MMP-2/9 expression and ERK phosphorylation. Derlin-1 mediated
upregulation of MMP-2/9 could be blocked by ERK inhibitor. In conclusion, our
study demonstrated that Derlin-1 is overexpressed in bladder cancer and promotes
malignant phenotype through ERK/MMP and PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.

superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-induced ER stress and
cell toxicity by reducing mutant SOD1 accumulation [9].
The role of Derlin-1 has also been implicated in human
cancers. Derlin-1 expression is elevated in breast cancer
and correlates with tumor grade and lymph node metastasis
[8]. A study using tissue microarray showed that Derlin-1
was up-regulated in six types of human carcinomas, and
Derlin-1-targeting antibodies suppressed colon tumor
growth in isogenic mice [10]. Derlin-1 expression is also
increased in lymph node metastases of canine mammary
adenocarcinomas [11]. Our previous study demonstrated
that Derlin-1 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung
cancers and promotes invasion through regulation of
EGFR activity [12]. These studies indicate that Derlin-1
plays an important role in cancer progression.
However, the mechanism of bladder cancer
progression, especially in muscle invasive bladder cancer,
has not been fully understood. The relationship between

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers
and its incidence is increasing in recent years [1]. The
prognosis of bladder cancer lies on its invasion depth,
lymph node metastasis and response to chemotherapy
[2-4]. Although combined therapies including surgery,
radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been improved, the
patient prognosis for high stage bladder cancer is still
poor. Development of chemoresistance plays a vital role
in the progression and poor response of bladder cancer and
identifying of related targets is an important task.
Derlin-1, a partner of the p97 ATPase complex,
was initially reported to mediate elimination of misfolded
proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and retrotranslocation of proteins into the cytosol [5-7]. Derlin-1
can relieve ER stress-induced apoptosis in breast cancer
cells [8]. Derlin-1 overexpression also ameliorates mutant

unclear. In this study, we examined Derlin-1 protein
expression in 150 cases of bladder cancer specimens. We

lines and examined its roles on cell proliferation, invasion
and chemoresistance. We also checked the molecular

significantly higher than that in Ta-T1 cancers. We did not
find significant correlation between Derlin-1 and other
clinical parameters including age, gender or tumor grade.
The associations between the patients’ survival and
Derlin-1 were studied using Kaplan-Meier plots and LogRank test. As shown in Figure 1D, Derlin-1 overexpression
associated with decreased overall survival (Log-Rank
test, p=0.0013). Univariate analysis and multiivariate
analysis (Cox model) revealed that Derlin-1 and T stage
were predicting factors for poor overall survival (Table 2).
We also divided these patients into 2 cohorts: those with
muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and those with
non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Statistical
analysis demonstrated that high Derlin-1expression was
associated with poor prognosis in MIBC cohort (LogRank test, p=0.0257, Figure 1E). There was no significant
association between Derlin-1 and survival in patients with
non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (Figure 1F). These
results indicate that Derlin-1 is overexpressed in MIBC
and correlates with poor prognosis.

RESULTS
Clinical significance of Derlin-1 in human
bladder cancers
We examined Derlin-1 protein expression in 150
cases of bladder cancer tissues (Figure 1). Negative
Derlin-1 staining was found in normal transitional
epithelial tissues (Figure 1A). Positive cytoplasmic
Derlin-1 staining was observed in bladder cancer tissues.
Derlin-1 overexpression was observed in 58 of 150
(38.6%) bladder cancer tissues examined. Representative
examples of positive IHC staining of Derlin-1 are
presented in Figure 1B and 1C. As shown in Table 1, the
rate of Derlin-1 overexpression was significantly higher in
muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (p=0.0079). The
percentages of Derlin-1 overexpression in T2 and T3-T4
cancers were 50.9% and 58.1% respectively, which were

Derlin-1 regulates cisplatin resistance in bladder
cancer cells

transitional epithelial cell line SV-HUC-1 and bladder
cancer cell lines. We found that 5637 (MIBC) and
T24 (MIBC) cell lines has high endogenous Derlin-1
expression, while BIU-87 (NMIBC), J82 cell lines and
normal SV-HUC-1 cell line have low endogenous Derlin-1
expression (Figure 2A). Derlin-1 transfection and siRNA
knockdown was performed in these cell lines. As shown in
Figure 2B, plasmid transfection significantly upregulated
Derlin-1 in J82 and BIU-87 at both protein and mRNA
levels. siRNA knockdown efficiency was also confirmed
in 5637 and T24 cells. Colony formation assay showed
Derlin-1 overexpression facilitated cell proliferation in
BIU-87 and J82 cell lines, while siRNA downregulated
colony number in 5637 and T24 cell lines (Figure 2C).
To characterize the role of Derlin-1 on invading ability,
matrigel invasion assay was performed. As shown in
Figure 2D, significant reduction of invading ability was
found in cells with Derlin-1 siRNA while Derlin-1 plasmid
enhanced invading ability.

To characterize the impact of Derlin-1 on drug
resistance of bladder cancer cells, MTT was performed
in cells treatment with different concentration of cisplatin
(5, 10, 15μM, 24 hours). Annexin V/PI analysis was
also carried out to examine the rate of apoptosis. As
shown in Figure 3, Derlin-1 significantly upregulated
cell viability in BIU-87 and J82 cells after 24 hours of
cisplatin treatment. On the contrary, Derlin-1 depletion
impaired cisplatin resistance in 5637 and T24 cell lines.
Accordingly, a decreased percentage of cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (5μM, 24 hours) was observed in J82 and BIU87 cells transfected with Derlin-1 plasmid compared with
empty vector. Derlin-1 depletion significantly upregulated
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in 5637 and T24 cells,
demonstrating that Derlin-1 confers chemoresistance in
bladder cancer cells.

inhibitor LY294005 was used to validate the involvement
of AKT activation in Derlin-1 induced Bcl-2 and cisplatin

blocked the effects of Derlin-1 on AKT phosphorylation
and Bcl-2 in J82 and BIU-87 cells. Similar as Derlin-1

Next, we asked what is the mechanism of Derlin-1
induced chemoresistance. We checked related protein
and found Derlin-1 upregulated Bcl-2, an important antiapoptosis protein while Derlin-1 siRNA downregulated
Bcl-2. Since Bcl-2 was the target of AKT signaling
pathway, we checked the change of AKT activity and found

4C, MTT results demonstrated that LY294005 reduced
cell viability and chemoresistance induced by Derlin-1
overexpression. To clarify the mechanism of Derlin-1 on
AKT activation, co-immunoprecipitation was performed
to examine if there is an association between Derlin-1 and

component of PI3K-AKT cascade. As shown in Figure
4D, Derlin-1 and PI3K p110α co-immunoprecipitated with
each other in bladder cancer cells. We did not detect their
association when extracts were immunoprecipitated with
normal rabbit IgG or other related proteins.

upregulated cell viability in BIU-87 and J82 cells after 24 hours of cisplatin treatment (5, 10, 15μM). Derlin-1 depletion downregulated
cisplatin resistance in 5637 and T24 cell lines. Annexin V/PI showed that Derlin-1 overexpression significantly downregulated cell apoptosis
in BIU-87 and J82 cells after 24 hours of 5μM cisplatin treatment. Derlin-1 depletion in 5637 and T24 cell lines showed the opposite effects.

Derlin-1 regulates invasion through MMP-9 and
MMP-2

(including JNK, p38 and ERK) which were previous
reported to be involved in MMP regulation. We found
that Derlin-1 overexpression significantly upregulated
ERK, MEK and EGFR phosphorylation. The change of
JNK and p38 phosphorylation was not significant (Figure
6A). These data suggests Derlin-1 induced MEK-ERK
activation may be responsible for MMP-2/9 upregulation.
To confirmed this, ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20μM, 6
hours) was applied in bladder cancer cells together with
Derlin-1 plasmid transfection. As shown in Figure 6B,
inhibitor treatment blocked the role of Derlin-1 on MMP2/9 upregulation in BIU-87 and J82 cells. Similar to
Derlin-1 siRNA, PD98059 treatment also reduced MMP2/9 in 5637 and T24 cell lines. In addition, we validated
the effects of ERK inhibition on cell invasion. As shown
in Figure 6C and 6D, ERK inhibitor treatment abolished
the effect of Derlin-1 on cell invasion in BIU-87 and J82
cells and reduced invading ability of 5637 and T24 cells.
These data suggest that Derlin-1 induces MMP-2/9 and
cell invasion through activation of MEK-ERK pathway.

In order to investigate the potential mechanism of
Derlin-1 induced bladder cancer cell invasion, we checked
the expression of invasion related proteins. The results
showed that Derlin-1 overexpression upregulated MMP-2
and MMP-9 (Figure 5A) while Derlin-1 siRNA decreased
levels of these proteins (Figure 5B). These data suggested
that Derlin-1 regulates bladder cancer invasion possibly
through regulation of MMP-9 and MMP-2.
To evaluate the contribution of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in
Derlin-1 induced invasion, we blocked invading ability using
MMP-2 and MMP-9 neutralizing antibodies (10 μg/mL).
As shown in Figure 5C, treatment of MMP-2/9 antibodies
blocked the invasion promoting effect of Derlin-1 on J82
and BIU-87 cell lines. As shown in Figure 5D, treatment
of MMP-2/9 antibodies reduced invading ability of 5637
and T24 cells, which was similar to the effects of Derlin-1
siRNA. Together, these results indicate that MMP-2 and
MMP-9 play a central role in Derlin-1 induced invasion.

DISCUSSION

Derlin-1 regulates MMP-2/9 through ERK
signaling

There is evidence in the literature implicating the
role of Derlin-1 in cancer progression. However, little
is known about its expression pattern in bladder cancer
or its role on chemoresistance. In this study, we identify

elevated expression of Derlin-1 in bladder cancer tissues
and cell lines, especially in MIBC. We demonstrate that
Derlin-1 induces bladder cancer invasion through ERK/
MMP signaling. We report for the first time that Derlin-1
contribute to the chemoresistance of cancer cells by
activation of AKT signaling, with subsequent downstream
Bcl-2 elevation. We further demonstrate that Derlin-1
could interact with PI3K p110α.
Immunohistochemistry showed that non-neoplastic
bladder urothelium was negative for Derlin-1 protein,
while Derlin-1 was upregulated in 58 of 150 bladder
cancer specimens and correlated with muscle invasive
phenotype (T2-T4). Importantly, we demonstrated that
Derlin-1 overexpression predicted poor patient survival.
Derlin-1 overexpression also correlated with poor
prognosis in the MIBC cohort. In the cohort of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), Derlin-1 did
not exhibit significant correlation with prognosis. These
results indicate that Derlin-1 signature might have clinical
values in predicting and providing prognostic information
for MIBC patients. Analysis of Derlin-1 in a series of
cell lines showed strong Derlin-1 expression in T24 and
5637 cell lines. In contrast, normal epithelial cell line

SV-HUC-1 showed very weak expression, which further
supports the fact of Derlin-1 overexpression.
Then we examined the biological effects of Derlin-1
using plasmid transfection and siRNA. Our results
demonstrated that Derlin-1 overexpression facilitated
proliferation and invasion, while its depletion inhibited
cell growth and invasion. Derlin-1 was has been reported
to induce proliferation and invasion in a variety of cancers
including lung and breast cancers [8, 12]. Our result is
in accord with previous studies indicating Derlin-1 as a
regulator of cancer aggressiveness.
The involvement of Derlin-1 in apoptosis and
chemoresistance has not been well investigated before.
Here, using MTT cell viability assay and AnnexinV/PI
analysis, we demonstrate that Derlin-1 confers cisplatin
resistance and reduced apoptosis in bladder cancer
cell lines. After searching of related proteins, we found
Derlin-1 positively regulated Bcl-2 and p-AKT levels
while its siRNA exhibited the opposite effects. It is well
established that Bcl-2 functions as an anti-apoptotic protein
and a AKT target protein [13]. Bcl-2 modulates multidrug resistance in bladder cancer cells and correlated with
patient response to chemotherapy [14-16]. To determine

whether Derlin-1 induced drug resistance involves PI3K/
AKT activation, we examined whether treatment with
the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294005 suppressed vialility
of Derlin-1-overexpressing bladder cancer cells in
response to cisplatin. Our data demonstrated that AKT
inhibitor LY294005 abolished the role of Derlin-1 on Bcl2 and chemoresistance, suggesting Derlin-1 upregulates
chemoresistance and inhibits apoptosis through AKT/Bcl2 signaling.
Since AKT signaling has been shown to be
controlled by the p85 and p110 subunit of PI3K, we
hypothesized that overexpression of Derlin-1 promotes
its interaction with these PI3K component. We isolated
Derlin-1 immune complexes from T24 and 5637 cells and
detected a markedly interaction of Derlin-1 with p110α
protein. Consistently, when we isolated endogenous p110α
immune complex, we also detected interaction between
p110α and Derlin-1. Derlin-1 siRNA decreased such
interaction. To date, this is the first report regarding the
mechanism of Derlin-1 in AKT activation. Our results not
only reveal the involvement of Derlin-1 in AKT signaling
transduction, but also provide a potential mechanism.
Further studies exploring the biochemical interaction
between Derlin-1 and PI3K/AKT and its signaling

networks, such as the mTOR pathway, will be beneficial
to understand the biological effects of Derlin-1.
Next we validate the underlying mechanism of
Derlin-1 induced invasion, we examined cell cycle
and invasion related proteins. We found that Derlin-1
overexpression upregulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein.
MMP-2 and MMP-9 were reported to play important roles
in bladder cancer cell invasion and metastasis [17, 18].
MMP-2/9 expression is controlled at many levels such
as gene transcription, enzyme activation, and could be
activated by several signaling pathways [12]. MEK-ERK
signaling was reported to activate MMP-2/9 transcription
[19-25]. Using MMP-2/9 antibodies and ERK inhibitor
PD98059, we validate that Derlin-1 induces bladder
cancer invasion through activation of ERK signaling,
which in turn upregulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein
expression. In addition, we checked EGFR status and
found that Derlin-1 overexpression could upregulate
EGFR phosphorylation, which was in accord with our
previous findings in lung cancer [12]. Our findings link
Derlin-1 with EGFR/ERK/MMP signaling and cancer
invasion, which contributes to the understanding regarding
mechanism of Derlin-1 in bladder cancer progression.
We also noticed that PD98059 treatment could induce

and EGFR phosphorylation in BIU-87 and J82 cell lines, without significant changes of JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Derlin-1 depletion

Derlin-1 protein in bladder cancer cells. It is reported that
derlin-1 expression was enhanced by ER stress-inducing
agents such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin [8]. The exact
mechanism remains unknown, which needs investigation
in our further research.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates
Derlin-1 is overexpressed in muscle invasive bladder
cancer and correlated with aggressive behavior. Derlin-1
contributes to bladder cancer cell invasion through
ERK/MMP signaling pathway. Derlin-1 also confers
chemoresistance by activating AKT/Bcl-2 pathway
through its interaction with p110α subunit of PI3K.

(Gibco, Invitrogen, USA).
The pcDNA5-DERL1 plasmid was kindly provided
from Dr. Satoshi Yamashita (Department of Neurology,
Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Japan).
The plasmid was transfected into cells using Attractene
Transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
pcDNA5 empty vector was used as a negative control. For
siRNA transfection, Derlin-1 siGENOME SMARTpool
siRNA and Negative control siRNA were obtained from
Dharmacon (GE healthcare, USA). DharmaFECT 1 (GE

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and specimens
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of China Medical University. Primary
tumor specimens were obtained from patients diagnosed
with bladder cancer who underwent resection between
2008 and 2014 in the First Affiliated Hospital of China
Medical University. Informed consents were obtained
from all patients. The histological diagnosis was evaluated
according to the WHO 2004 guidelines. Clinical data was
obtained from medical records. Intravesical chemotherapy
was carried out in patients with T1-T2 bladder cancer.
Cisplatin based systemic chemotherapy was used in
patients with T3-T4 bladder cancer. The first follow-up
was carried out 2 months after surgery. Then cystoscopy,
urine cytology and ultrasound results were evaluated every
3-6 months thereafter. The mean follow-up time was 39.3
months.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR
Green master mix (TAKARA, Dalian, China).
PCR was performed using 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). β-actin was used as
the reference gene. The relative expression of target
genes were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. The
primer sequences are as follow: Derlin-1 forward, 5’

sections
were
prepared.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using the Elivision
plus kit purchased from Maixin (MaiXin, Fuzhou, China).
Deparaffinized was performed using xylene. Sections were
rehydrated with graded alcohol. Antigen retrieval was
performed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 2 minutes. H2O2
was used to block the endogenous peroxidase. Normal
goat serum was used to reduce nonspecific binding. Then
sections were incubated with Derlin-1 rabbit polyclonal
antibody (1:400 dilution; Sigma) overnight at 4°C. Rabbit
immunoglobulin (at the same concentration as for the
antigen-specific antibody) was used as a negative control.
The staining was followed by incubation with polymer
secondary antibodies. The peroxidase reaction was
developed with DAB plus from Maixin (Maixin, Fuzhou,
China). Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin, and
the sections were dehydrated in alcohol before mounting.
We evaluated Derlin-1 staining according to a previous
report [12]. Briefly, the cytoplasmic intensity of Derlin-1
staining was scored as 0 (no signal), 1 (moderate),

PVDF membrane were visualized using ECL kit (Pierce)
and obtained using DNR Imaging System (DNR, Israel).

The study was supported by the National Natural
Science Foundation of China (No.81302022 to Qianze
Dong; No, 81572854 to Enhua Wang).

Colony formation and MTT assays
For colony formation assay, cells were transfected
for 48h and plated into three 6-cm cell culture dishes
(1000 cells). Cells were incubated for about 2 weeks in
medium. Plates were washed with PBS and stained with
Giemsa. The number of colonies with more than 50 cells
was counted. The colonies were manually counted using
a microscope.
For MTT assay, 24 hours after transfection, cells
were plated in 96-well plates in at a concentration
approximately 2000 cells per well. For quantification
of cell viability, 20 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT (thiazolyl blue)
solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h
at 37°C. The medium was removed from each well and
150 μl of DMSO was added to the well. The plate was
measured at 490 nm.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Matrigel invasion assay was carried out using a
24-well Transwell chamber from Costar (Corning, USA)
coated with 20 µl Matrigel with a dilution rate of 1:6 (BD
Bioscience, USA). 48 hours after the transfection, cells
were trypsinized and transferred to the upper chamber with
our serum and incubated for 18 hours. Lower chamber was
added with medium supplemented with 10% serum. Noninvaded cells were wiped out and cells invaded through
the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
stained with hematoxylin.

Magnetic Beads (Bio-Rad SureBeads, USA)
were incubated with antibodies and unbound antibodies
were washed away. Then beads-antibody complex was
incubated with target protein. The beads were magnetized
using SureBeads magnetic rack and supernatant was
discarded. Then elution buffer was used to collect purified
target protein for western blot analysis.

We adopted SPSS version 16 for statistical analysis.
χ2 test was used to examine possible correlations between
Derlin-1 expression and clinicopathologic factors. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probability
of patient survival, and differences in the survival of
subgroups of patients were compared by using Mantel’s
log-rank test. The Cox regression model was used for
multivariate analysis. Student’s t-test was used to compare
other date. p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
