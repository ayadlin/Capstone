BACKGROUND. Biochemical results from a prospective Phase II trial of intermittent androgen suppression for recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy were
analyzed for correlations to the onset of hormone-refractory disease.

METHODS. Patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate
and a rising serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after external beam irra-

diation of the prostate were treated intermittently with a 36-week course of
cyproterone acetate and leuprolide acetate. Then, patients were stratified according to their serum PSA range at the start of each cycle and were followed with
further biochemical testing until disease progression was evident.

RESULTS. The mean PSA reduction was 95.2% irrespective of stratification group.
A baseline serum PSA level <10 lg/L and a serum PSA nadir 0.2 lg/L were
associated with the longest time off treatment. The overall mean nadir PSA value
in the progression group at 1.40  0.19 lg/L was 2.6-fold greater than the value
of 0.55  0.88 lg/L in the no-progression group (P ¼ .0002). Recovery of serum
testosterone to a level of 7.5 nmol/L was observed in 75%, 50%, 40%, and 30%
of men in Cycles 1 to 4, respectively, and was sufficient to normalize the level of
hemoglobin in each cycle, which dropped by an average of 10.8 g/L during treatment (P < .0001).

T

he concept that intermittent androgen suppression will improve
quality of life and delay the evolution of androgen resistance in
patients with prostate cancer has been the focus of several clinical
studies.1,2 Although it is unlikely that any type of hormone therapy
will cure the malignancy,3 there is growing appreciation of the
potential benefits of preserving the hormone-dependent state of a
tumor for an extended time; this includes the possibility of changing
a metastatic and fatal disease into a chronic state that is amenable
to long-term control.4,5 The prospect of maintaining apoptotic
potential through cyclic exposure to androgens has been evaluated
in a Canadian prospective Phase II trial that examined intermittent

androgen suppression as a form of therapy for men
in biochemical failure after they received externalbeam irradiation for locally advanced disease.6 Conducted between 1995 and 2001, the study afforded
an extensive database for detailed examination not
only of the clinical parameters related to intermittent
androgen suppression6 but also of the biochemical
effects, as described in this report.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma who had rising serum prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels after external-beam irradiation of the
prostate were accepted into the study. Patient characteristics were as follows: The mean age ( standard
error) at baseline was 73.3  0.7 years; 76% of
patients had clinical stage T2b and T3 tumors; 47.6%
of patients had Gleason scores 7, and 52.4% had
Gleason scores 6; 83.7%, of patients had positive
biopsies, and 16.3% had negative biopsies; the mean
time to PSA failure ( standard error) after irradiation was 4.6  0.3 years; the mean pretreatment serum PSA ( standard error) was 21.2  1.6 lg/L; and
the mean testosterone level ( standard error) was
13.2  0.4 mol/L. This clinical trial antedated the
introduction of conformal radiotherapy and dose
escalation in Canada; conventional practice would
have entailed from 65 grays (Gy) to 66 Gy in 1.8-Gy
to 2.0-Gy fractions using a standard 4-field box. PSA
testing was not available generally prior to 1992;
thus, data on serum PSA levels in the trial population
before the start of radiation (range, 10–20 lg/L) are
incomplete. The mean and median follow-up were
3.7 years and 4.2 years, respectively.6
Design of Study
This was a prospective, noncomparative, open-label,
multicenter study. Of 109 patients who were accrued
to the study, 103 patients were evaluable.6 Patients
were followed on study until the development of
androgen-independent disease (time to progression),
which we defined as 3 sequential increases in serum
PSA >4.0 lg/L despite castrate levels of serum testosterone. On this basis, patients were divided into a no
progression group and a progression group. Treatment in each cycle consisted of cyproterone acetate
given as lead-in therapy for 4 weeks, followed by a
combination of leuprolide acetate and cyproterone
acetate, and ending after a total of 36 weeks. If the
serum PSA level was <4.0 lg/L at both 24 weeks and
32 weeks with a constant or decreasing slope, then
therapy was stopped at 36 weeks. If the serum PSA

859

level was not <4.0 lg/L at both 24 weeks and 32
weeks, then the patient was not eligible for interruption of therapy and was taken off study. Serum PSA
and testosterone levels were monitored every 4 weeks,
and therapy was resumed when the serum PSA level
reached 10 lg/L. At the conclusion of the clinical
trial, 103 patients had been initiated into Cycle 1, 86
patients had been initiated into Cycle 2, 56 patients
had been initiated into Cycle 3, 26 patients had been
initiated into Cycle 4, and 7 patients had been
initiated into Cycle 5. Details of the final disposition
of patients as well as the complete panel of clinical
and biochemical evaluations have been described
previously.6

Measurement of Serum PSA and Testosterone
Whole venous blood (5 mL) routinely was collected
in the morning, allowed to clot, and centrifuged, and
the separated serum was used for the assay. Serum
PSA was measured initially by using the Abbott
AxSYM Total PSA poly/mono assay, which soon was
supplanted by the Abbott AxSYM Total PSA mono/
mono assay. The reference interval was 4.0 lg/L
and encompassed 94.7% of specimens from normal
males. The lower reportable limit of detection
was <0.02 lg/L. Pairwise statistical comparisons of
PSA stratification groups were based on the MannWhitney test.
Serum testosterone was measured by the DPC
Coat-A-Count total testosterone radioimmunoassay
method. The reference ranges were from 8.6 to
64 nmol/L for men ages 20 to 49 years and from
6.3 to 27 nmol/L for men aged 50 years. Note that
blunting of the circadian rhythm in aging men may
reduce daily variations within the reference range.7
For the purposes of the current analyses, we assumed
that a value of 7.5 nmol/L approximated the lower
limit of the normal range for all ages. The lower
reportable limit of detection was <0.3 nmol/L.
Ethical Review
This study was approved for implementation by the
Health Protection Branch of the Ministry of Health of
Canada and by the Clinical Research Ethics Review
Board of each participating center. All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with
institutional guidelines.

serum PSA and testosterone was biphasic in each of
4 consecutive cycles. Typically, there was an initial
steep slope followed by a shallow slope. For the
serum PSA level, it is believed that this represents an
initial inhibition of PSA synthesis over the first 8 to
10 weeks, after which apoptotic cell loss accounts for
further reduction in serum PSA.4 The mean serum
PSA values at the beginning of each cycle were
18.5 lg/L, 10.5 lg/L, 11.5 lg/L, and 11.9 lg/L, for
Cycles 1 thorough 4, respectively. The overall reduction of serum PSA during the on-treatment period
amounted to 98.2% in Cycle 1, 91.8% in Cycle 2,
96.3% in Cycle 3, and 94.5% in Cycle 4 for an average
reduction of 95.2%.
The mean serum testosterone values at the beginning of each cycle were 12.8 nmol/L, 9.2 nmol/L,
8.2 nmol/L, and 7.2 nmol/L for Cycles 1 through
4, respectively. The corresponding PSA nadir values
at 36 weeks of treatment were 0.45 nmol/L, 0.40 nmol/
L, 0.38 nmol/L, and 0.50 nmol/L, respectively. Thus,
the overall reduction of serum testosterone during
the on-treatment period amounted to 96.5% in
Cycle 1, 95.6% in Cycle 2, 95.3% in Cycle 3, and
93.6% in Cycle 4 for an average reduction of
95.3%. These observations indicate that there is a
reproducible inhibitory effect of treatment on testicular function even as the number of cycles
increases. A trend toward reduced baseline levels
of serum testosterone at the start of each cycle is
in keeping with a declining ability of the testis to
recover and synthesize a normal amount of testosterone.8,9

FIGURE 2. Comparative intercyclic rates of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction. The percentage reduction of serum PSA versus time of
treatment was calculated for each on-treatment period of 4 consecutive
cycles of intermittent androgen suppression.

Relative Rates of Serum PSA Reduction Versus Cycle
The percentage reduction in serum PSA versus the
duration of treatment for each of 4 consecutive
cycles is plotted in Figure 2. In all 4 cycles, a plateau
was achieved at approximately 95% after 40 weeks
of treatment. The plateau level in Cycle 1 was
attained after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment, whereas a
longer period of treatment, 36 to 40 weeks, was
required to reach the same level in Cycles 2, 3, and 4.

PSA range and to establish whether there may be
some predictive value inferred from such a relation,
patients were stratified according to PSA ranges of
4 < 3 10 lg/L, 10 < 3 20 lg/L, and >20 lg/L, as
indicated in Table 1. The magnitude of PSA response
was calculated relative to the baseline PSA at the beginning of each cycle. Patients in Cycle 1 with a PSA
range of 4 < 3 10 lg/L showed a mean reduction
of 7.4  0.3 lg/L. Patients with a PSA range of
10 < 3 20 lg/L had a mean 2-fold greater reduction of 14.0  0.5 lg/L (P < .0001). Another approximate doubling to 34.6  3.5 lg/L (P < .0001) was
observed in patients with a serum PSA range >20
lg/L. Despite the greater absolute reductions in serum PSA with increasing baseline serum PSA at the
beginning of each cycle, the percentage reduction
was relatively constant between 95.8% and 97.2%.
Similar trends in absolute and percentage reductions
in serum PSA were observed in Cycles 2, 3, and 4
with an overall mean percentage reduction that
incorporated all ranges of 94.6%.

The results presented in Table 2 show the relation
between the baseline serum PSA level and the mean
time off treatment when patients were stratified into
3 different groups according to their serum PSA
range: 4 < 3 10 lg/L, 10 < 3 20 lg/L, and
>20 lg/L. In Cycle 1, the mean time off treatment in
the first group was 90.7  11.5 weeks, which decreased by a statistically significant 29% to 65.2  5.4
weeks (P ¼ .0393) in the second group and by 57% to
39.4  4.6 weeks (P < .0001) in the third group. In

nonsignificant 39.9% to 40  3.4 weeks (P ¼ .0677) in
the second group, and no further decrease was

the mean time off treatment in the first group was
considerably lower at 26.2  5 weeks and also
was lower than the values in the other 2 groups
(35.5  4.2 weeks and 40.7  4.5 weeks for the second and third groups, respectively). The mean time

trial, patients were stratified according to PSA range,
and mean nadir levels of serum PSA were calculated
for each category. The resultant data (not shown)
indicated that, in Cycle 1, in the first group (men
with baseline serum PSA 4 < 3 10 lg/L), the mean
nadir level of serum PSA was 0.3  0.1 lg/L. This
increased to 0.6  0.1 lg/L in the second group
(men with baseline serum PSA 10 < 3 20 lg/L)
and to 1.0  0.3 lg/L in the third group (men with
baseline serum PSA >20 lg/L). Thus, there was a
3-fold difference in the mean nadir level of serum
PSA (P ¼ .05) between men with the lowest baseline serum PSA range and men with the highest
baseline serum PSA range. Similar trends were
observed in Cycles 2, 3, and 4 but were not statistically significant.

Mean Time Off Treatment Versus PSA Nadir
The inverse correlation between the nadir level of
PSA and time off treatment is illustrated by the data
provided in Table 3. For men in Cycle 1 who had
nadir levels of serum PSA 0.2 lg/L, the mean time
off treatment was 75.7  7.1 weeks. This time off
treatment was reduced by a relatively constant 30%
to 53.5  5.0 weeks for men who had nadir levels of
serum PSA 0.2 < 3 1.0 lg/L, to 37.2  6.7 weeks
for men who had nadir levels of serum PSA 1.0
< 3 2.0 lg/L, and to 26.5  8.4 weeks for men who
had nadir levels of serum PSA >2.0 lg/L. The mean
time off treatment for men who achieved nadir levels
of serum PSA 0.2 lg/L was 3 times greater
(P ¼ .0046) than the time off treatment for men who
had nadir levels of serum PSA >2.0 lg/L. A similar
but weaker trend was observed in Cycle 2; and, by
Cycle 3, the differences in time off treatment among
the different stratification groups, for the most part,
had disappeared. Even in the most favorable stratifi-

cation groups (ie, nadir levels of serum PSA 0.2 lg/
L, 0.2 < 3 1.0 lg/L, and 1.0 < 3 2.0 lg/L), the
mean time off treatment decreased as the number of
cycles increased.

Relation Between PSA Nadir and Progression
To investigate a possible relation between nadir
levels of serum PSA and treatment outcomes, the nadir levels achieved in different stratification ranges
were compared between progression-free patients
and patients who developed disease progression. The
results of that comparison are shown in Table 4. In
all cycles (except Cycle 1 in the 4 < 3 10 stratification range), the absence of disease progression was
associated with a mean nadir level of serum PSA less
than the corresponding level in the same stratification range associated with disease progression.
The mean nadir level of serum PSA obtained by
combining the nadir levels of all cycles within a
given stratification range was compared in the noprogression and progression groups (Table 5). If the
PSA range was 4 < 3 10 lg/L, then the mean nadir
was 0.41  0.08 lg/L in patients without disease progression, and it was 2.6-fold greater (1.06  0.43 lg/
L) in patients with disease progression (P ¼ .0325). If
the PSA range was 10 < 3 20 lg/L, then the mean
nadir values corresponding to the same 2 groups
were 0.56  0.06 lg/L and 1.35  0.24 lg/L, respectively, for a 2.4-fold significant difference (P ¼ .0004).
A PSA range >20 was characterized by mean nadir
values of 0.75  0.20 lg/L and 1.67  0.40 lg/L,
respectively, for a 2.3-fold significant difference
(P ¼ .0111) between the groups. Combining nadir
values for all stratification ranges of serum PSA,
the mean nadir associated with no progression was
0.55  0.05 lg/L compared with 1.40  0.19 lg/L

Recovery of Serum Testosterone and PSA After
Interruption of Therapy
The data presented in Figure 3 show the rates of
increase in serum levels of testosterone and PSA after
the interruption of androgen withdrawal therapy for
each of 4 cycles. In Cycle 1, serum testosterone levels
recovered to a peak of 10 nmol/L approximately
50 weeks after the beginning of the off-treatment
part of the cycle. The mean levels then decreased
gradually over the next 150 weeks and plateaued at
approximately 2.5 nmol/L, because the patients who
remained in the off-treatment period of Cycle 1

beyond 1 year comprised a group with delayed,
incomplete, or no testosterone recovery. Serum PSA
levels also increased, but the velocity of increase
lagged behind that of serum testosterone, plateaued
at 7.5 lg/L approximately 80 weeks after the start of
the off-treatment period, and remained at that level
beyond 250 weeks. This plateau effect occurred
because the only patients whose PSA was still being
measured in Cycle 1 at these time points were men
with low serum testosterone levels whose PSA levels
had not gone high enough to move into Cycle 2. In
Cycles 2 through 4, the gap between the rate of
increase in serum testosterone levels and the rate of
increase in serum PSA levels became smaller. The
serum PSA level achieved a more durable plateau in
men whose serum testosterone levels remained in
the vicinity of 5 nmol/L, resulting in a longer time
off treatment.

Recovery of Testicular Function
The ability of testis to restore serum testosterone
levels to the normal range was examined by plotting
the percentage of patients who had serum testosterone levels 7.5 nmol/L as a function of time after
the interruption of androgen withdrawal therapy
(Fig. 4). In Cycle 1, recovery of testicular function
was complete after approximately 5 months, and
from 70% to 75% of men showed serum testosterone
levels in this range. The recovery of serum testosterone in Cycle 2 was characterized by a longer lag

period before the level of testosterone began to
increase; and, by 5 months after the start of the offtreatment period, only approximately 50% of men
had achieved serum testosterone levels 7.5 nmol/L.
In Cycles 3 and 4, there was a further reduction in
the percentage of men whose serum testosterone
levels recovered into the normal range.

Effect of Intermittent Androgen Suppression
on Hemoglobin
We expected that intermittent androgen suppression
would influence blood hemoglobin levels; and,

indeed, it was possible to document fluctuations in
each of 4 cycles of therapy, as shown in Figure 5.
From a baseline level of 143.3  1.8 g/L, hemoglobin
levels decreased by 7.6 g/L to 135.7  3.4 g/L at the
end of the period of androgen suppression in Cycle
1. After interruption of therapy, the hemoglobin
increased to the baseline level of 143.8  1.9 g/L;
then, it dropped by 14.7 g/L to 129.1  5.3 g/L at the
end of treatment in Cycle 2 before recovering to
139.9  2.4 g/L after therapy was interrupted. Further reductions and recoveries of hemoglobin of similar magnitude were observed in Cycles 3 and 4. The

Prospective IAS Trial—Biochemical Data/Bruchovsky et al.

overall mean baseline hemoglobin level at the start
of each cycle was 143.1  1.7 g/L (n ¼ 140 patients);
this was reduced to 132.3  2.3 g/L (n ¼ 36 patients)
at the time that therapy was interrupted, a difference
of 10.8 g/L (P < .0001). Thus, despite declining levels
of serum testosterone, as documented in Figure 4,
these were sufficient to restore hemoglobin levels
to normal in each successive cycle of intermittent
therapy.

DISCUSSION
Biochemical recurrence after irradiation for localized
prostate cancer proved amenable to cyclic androgen
withdrawal therapy and showed a reproducible pattern of response for levels of serum PSA and testosterone in 4 consecutive cycles (Fig. 1). The overall
mean reduction of serum PSA levels during the ontreatment period was 95.2%. Reductions of this magnitude were associated with an approximately 40%
decrease in the volume of the prostate in Cycles 1
and 2, but there were no detectable changes in
volume in Cycles 3 and 4.6
The observations presented in Table 1 indicate
that the total reduction in serum PSA is a function of
the serum PSA value at the start of each cycle of
treatment. Although a patient may be stratified into
a different PSA range with increasing cycle number,
and although the magnitude of the PSA reduction
may increase or decrease accordingly, the actual
percentage change in serum PSA remains the same
(overall mean reduction, 94.6%). Thus, a shift from 1
stratification level to another will affect the net
reduction in serum PSA, but this would not be
accompanied by any alteration in the percentage
decrease, which remains almost constant at 95%. It
follows that the stratification level of serum PSA in
itself has no predictive value insofar as all patients will
experience a drop in serum PSA in the vicinity of 95%.
The rate of serum PSA reduction decreased as
the number of treatment cycles increased (Fig. 2). A
maximum reduction in serum PSA levels of 95% was
observed in all 4 cycles after 40 weeks of treatment.
However, the plateau level in Cycle 1 was observed
after from 20 weeks to 24 weeks of treatment,
whereas a longer period (from 36 weeks to 40 weeks)
was required to reach the same plateau level in
Cycles 2, 3, and 4. This lengthening may reflect the
selection of increasingly testosterone-sensitive tumors
in successive cycles (Fig. 3) and the need for a
greater, time-dependent reduction of serum testosterone (Fig. 1). Because the maximum achievable
reduction in serum PSA was 95%, it is plausible that
the on-treatment period could be shortened and

865

limited to the length of time required to bring about
a 95% reduction in the level of serum PSA.10,11
The overall mean reduction in the serum testosterone level during the on-treatment periods for all
cycles of therapy was 95.3% (Fig. 1). There was progressive reduction in the baseline levels of serum
testosterone at the start of each cycle, suggesting
that the ability of the testis to recover and synthesize
a normal level of testosterone declined with repeated
cycling. Whether this represented primary gonadal
failure or failure secondary to pituitary insufficiency
was not assessed in our study.
In relating mean time off treatment to the baseline serum PSA level at trial entry (Table 2), it was
demonstrated that a serum PSA level <10 lg/L was
associated with the longest time off treatment; this
treatment-free interval was 27% shorter in Cycle 2,
71% shorter in Cycle 3, and 74% shorter in Cycle 4.
The same trend toward a shorter time off treatment
was observed in the group of patients who had baseline serum PSA levels in the 10 < 3 20 lg/L range.
For the patients who had baseline serum PSA levels
>20 lg/L, the time off treatment remained constant
in the first 3 cycles before it became shorter in the
Cycle 4. The finding that, in Cycle 1, the time off
treatment in the group of men with serum PSA in
the 4 < 3 10 lg/L range, relative to the men with
serum PSA levels >20 lg/L, was 2.3 times longer
(P < .0001) suggests that intermittent androgen suppression therapy should be started before the serum
PSA reaches a level of 10 lg/L. We speculate that the
mean time off treatment is significantly longer in
the lower serum PSA range, because patients have a
smaller residual tumor burden after androgen withdrawal. Thus, the subsequent regrowth of tumor
based on PSA, a variable that depends on the
number of cells and the level of PSA up-regulation,
should take place at a slower rate.
Because the data shown in Table 1 indicate that
androgen withdrawal routinely will produce a constant 95% reduction in the serum PSA level independent of the range of serum PSA at baseline, it is
clear that there will be a direct relation between the
serum PSA level at the start of androgen withdrawal
and the achievable nadir PSA level. This relation
was most apparent in Cycle 1, in which there was a
3-fold difference in nadir values between men who
had baseline serum PSA levels in the lowest range
compared with men who had baseline serum PSA
levels that fell within the highest range. Furthermore,
there was an inverse relation between PSA nadir and
time off treatment (Table 3), with the longest time
off treatment observed in Cycle 1 among men who
had nadir values of serum PSA 0.2 lg/L. Because

866

the serum PSA level will decrease by 95% over a
treatment period of 36 weeks, we infer that the time
off treatment will be superior if androgen withdrawal
is introduced when the serum PSA level is approximately 4.0 lg/L.
The mean nadir level of serum PSA tended to
increase with more cycles of therapy in each of the 3
stratification ranges, an effect that was slightly more
pronounced in the group of men who progressed to
androgen independence during the course of this
study (Table 4). The overall mean nadir value was
0.55  0.05 lg/L in the no-progression group compared with a 2.6-fold greater value of 1.40  0.19 lg/
L (P ¼ .0002) in the progression group (Table 5). This
is in keeping with the data reported by Scholtz and
colleagues,12 who observed that a PSA nadir of
>0.1 ng/mL was an important factor for predicting
the early onset of androgen independence. It is
possible that the successive increases in PSA nadir
levels in all stratification ranges are the results of
recruiting alternative pathways of androgen receptor
activation under conditions of testosterone deprivation, an early step in progression to androgen
independence.5
Univariate analysis of progression-free survival
data revealed that the Cycle 1 PSA nadir was a significant prognostic factor (P < .001), whereas no significance could be attached to age (P ¼ .1), clinical stage
at initial diagnosis (P ¼ .08), Gleason score (P ¼ .8),
baseline prostatic volume (P ¼ .7), baseline PSA
(P ¼ .6), baseline testosterone (P ¼ .09), or time from
irradiation to the start of treatment (P ¼ .1). Multivariate analysis of selected factors confirmed the significance of Cycle 1 PSA nadir (hazard ratio, 2.2;
P ¼ .001) but not of age, clinical stage, baseline PSA,
baseline testosterone, or time from irradiation to
the start of treatment.
There was a close relation between the recoveries
of serum testosterone and PSA (Fig. 3). Men who had
serum testosterone levels that recovered quickly experienced a more rapid increase in serum PSA levels,
affording a shorter off-treatment period in the range
from 50 weeks to 100 weeks. In approximately 10%
of patients, the mean levels of serum testosterone
in Cycle 1 decreased after 100 weeks to plateau at
2.5 nmol/L. The abnormally low serum testosterone
levels in such men resulted in a prolonged time off
treatment that occasionally lasted up to 5 years.
Closing of the gap between the rate of increase
in serum testosterone and the rate of increase in
serum PSA likely reflects the selection of more
androgen-sensitive tumors.5 Men with such tumors
will experience a rapid increase in serum PSA as
testosterone recovers, triggering the resumption of

androgen withdrawal therapy. The finding that the
mean durations of the off-treatment period in Cycles
2, 3, and 4 (46.2  3.3 weeks, 35.7  2.8 weeks, and
27.2  3.2 weeks, respectively) were considerably
shorter than in Cycle 1 (63.7  4.4 weeks)6 supports
this hypothesis.
After the interruption of androgen withdrawal
therapy in Cycle 1, 75% of men demonstrated recovery of serum testosterone into the low normal range
(7.5 nmol/L) within 5 months after the interruption
of therapy (Fig. 4), in agreement with the observations of Nejat et al.8 This percentage decreased in
succeeding Cycles 2, 3, and 4 to 50%, 40%, and 30%,
respectively. Despite such evidence of declining
testicular function, the levels of serum testosterone
were able to restore hemoglobin to normal in successive cycles in which the hemoglobin had dropped by
an average of 10.8 g/L during treatment. The reversal
of anemia by intermittent androgen suppression has
been noted by others.13
The current data highlight several correlations
between serum PSA and the outcome of intermittent
androgen suppression in men with locally advanced
prostate cancer who have progressed after radiotherapy. We observed that the nadir level of serum PSA
was a strong determinant of time off treatment and
a powerful predictor of hormone-refractory tumor
progression. The nadir level of serum PSA itself is
determined by the baseline serum PSA level and a
95% limit on the reduction of serum PSA in response
to androgen withdrawal. From these observations,
we conclude that the benefit of intermittent androgen suppression is most apparent if the serum PSA
level is 4 lg/L when therapy is started. An advantage of early hormone therapy in the treatment of
recurrent prostate cancer also can be implied from
our data. The effects of intermittent androgen suppression on quality of life and on progression-free
and overall survival will be discussed in a subsequent
report.
