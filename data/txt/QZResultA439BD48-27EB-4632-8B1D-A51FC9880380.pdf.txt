CIP2A Modulates Cell-Cycle Progression in Human Cancer
Cells by Regulating the Stability and Activity of Plk1
Jae-Sung Kim1, Eun Ju Kim2, Jeong Su Oh3, In-Chul Park1, and Sang-Gu Hwang1

Abstract
Abnormal cell-cycle control can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and cancer. The oncoprotein cancerous
inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that stabilizes
c-Myc. However, the precise role of CIP2A in cell division is not understood. Herein, we show that CIP2A is required
for mitotic progression by regulating the polo-like kinase (Plk1). With mitotic entry, CIP2A translocated from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it was enriched at spindle poles. CIP2A depletion delayed mitotic progression,
resulting in mitotic abnormalities independent of PP2A activity. Unexpectedly, CIP2A interacted directly with
the polo-box domain of Plk1 during mitosis. This interaction was required to maintain Plk1 stability by blocking
APC/C-Cdh1–dependent proteolysis, thereby enhancing the kinase activity of Plk1 during mitosis. We observed
strong correlation and in vivo interactions between these two proteins in multiple human cancer specimens.
Overall, our results established a novel function for CIP2A in facilitating the stability and activity of the pivotal
mitotic kinase Plk1 in cell-cycle progression and tumor development. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6667–78. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Proper cell-cycle progression involves coordination of multiple events, such as chromosome condensation, spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis, and is
tightly controlled by posttranslational modiﬁcations such as
phosphorylation and ubiquitination (1, 2). For example, mitotic kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1, polo-like
kinases (Plk), and Aurora kinases, phosphorylate their substrates during mitotic progression. In contrast, components of
the ubiquitin–proteasome system, such as the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), in turn directs the
ordered destruction of critical mitotic substrates (i.e., spindle
assembly checkpoint proteins) and mitotic kinases (1, 2). Thus,
the concerted effort of mitotic kinases and the APC/C is
required for ﬁne tuning of cell-cycle progression.
Plk1 plays a crucial role in multiple steps of mitosis, including the G2–M transition, centrosome maturation, bipolar
spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis
(3, 4). Plk1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a
C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD) that have been implicated
in regulating kinase activity and subcellular localization (3, 4).

Plk1 activity begins to increase during G2-phase and peaks in
mitosis. This temporal control is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (4). In the
late G2-phase, Plk1 is activated by phosphorylation of Thr210 in
the T-loop by Aurora A kinase/bora (4). In contrast, downregulation of Plk1 is mediated by the ubiquitin–proteasome
system, involving APC/C-Cdh1 or -Cdc20, during the late M
and G1 phases (2, 4). Consistent with the diverse roles of Plk1 in
mitosis, inhibition of Plk1 leads to multiple mitotic defects,
including aberrant spindle formation, misaligned chromosomes, and improper chromosome condensation (5–7). In
addition, Plk1 is highly upregulated in tumors and inhibition
of its activity induces apoptosis in cancer cells, but not in
normal cells (4, 8). Thus, Plk1 is a promising drug target in
cancer therapy (8). However, the regulatory mechanisms of
tumor-associated Plk1 are poorly understood.
Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A;
CIP2A), also named KIAA1524 or p90 tumor-associated antigen,
is a novel oncogene that is known to inhibit c-Myc–associated
PP2A activity and thereby stabilize the oncogenic c-Myc
in human malignancies (9). Downregulation of CIP2A reduces
malignant cellular growth and in vivo tumor formation (9–11).
In addition, overexpression of CIP2A has been found in several
common cancers and is associated with poor prognosis
(9–14). Furthermore, recent reports have suggested that CIP2A
is a potential target for anticancer drugs in several cancers
(11, 15–18). Although the oncogenic role of CIP2A in human
malignancies has been suggested, the mechanisms through
which it exerts its oncogenic properties are still unclear.
In this study, we investigated the novel functions of CIP2A in
cell division. We showed that CIP2A binds with Plk1 to regulate
Plk1 stability and activity during mitosis. Furthermore, we
provided evidence of the clinical relevance of this regulatory
mechanism in human cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, synchronization, and treatment
HeLa, H1299, H460, Hs68, 293T, and 293 cells (American
Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 10%
FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Fluorescent ubiquitinationbased cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI)-expressing HeLa cells were
obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank. Cells were preserved and
passaged according to the ATCC protocol for no longer than
2 months and tested monthly for Mycoplasma infection by
Hoechst 33258 staining. Cells were synchronized at G1–S or
G2–M phase by a double thymidine block/release or nocodazole block protocol (19). Brieﬂy, cells were treated with 2
mmol/L thymidine (Sigma) for 16 hours. After releasing cells
for 2 hours, cells were transfected with siRNAs. Eight hours
after release from the ﬁrst thymidine block, thymidine was readded for an additional 14 hours. Cells were released from the
second thymidine block into medium with or without 100 ng/
mL nocodazole (Sigma), dependent on the experimental
design. To measure endogenous Plk1 stability, cells were
incubated with 100 mg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma) for the
indicated times. For proteosome inhibition, cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L MG132 (Sigma) for 3 hours. Okadaic acid
(50 nmol/L; Sigma) or forskolin (40 mmol/L; Sigma) was used to
inhibit or activate PP2A activity, respectively.
Plasmid constructs
Human CIP2A cDNA purchased from Origene was PCRampliﬁed and cloned into pEXPR-IBA105 (Strep fusion) and
pcDNA3.1-Myc (Myc fusion) vectors. CIP2A.1 siRNA–resistant
cDNA, generated by inserting four silent mutations, was cloned
into the pcDNA3.1-Myc vector. The following mutagenizing
oligonucleotides were used: 50 -tcaccttgttggcccatagtagtttaactgtcgtcgtcttcgcactttcaatattatcc-30 (sense), and 50 -ggataatattgaaagtgcgaagacgacgacagttaaactactatgggccaacaaggtgat-30 (antisense). PTEN, Flag-tagged CHFR, and Plk1 constructs (WT,
FAA, N-terminus, and C-terminus) were kindly provided by Dr.
J.K. Park (Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences,
Seoul, South Korea), Dr. J. H. Seol (Seoul National University,
Seoul, Korea), and Dr. H. S. Yim (Hanyang University, Seongdong-gu, Korea), respectively.
RNA interference
The following sequences were used for RNA interference:
CIP2A.1, 50 -cugugguuguguuugcacutt-30 ; CIP2A.2, 50 -ggagugguuugucggagca-30 ; CIP2A.3, 50 -caaguguaccacucuuaua-30 ; Plk1,

MAD2, 50 - aaagtggtgaggtcctggaaa-30 . Nonsilencing siRNA (Bioneer) was used as a negative control. Transfection of siRNAs
(50 nmol/L CIP2A.1, CIP2A.2, Plk1, Cdc20, and MAD2; 100
nmol/L CIP2A.3; and 20 nmol/L PP2A-Aa and PP2A-Ab) was
conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. For stable depletion of CIP2A,
FUCCI–HeLa cells were transduced with control or CIP2A
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells grown on coverslips were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were permeabilized and blocked with
0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal calf serum in PBS. The ﬁxed cells
were consecutively incubated with primary antibodies against
phospho-H3 (Millipore; 1:500), cyclin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:200), pericentrin (Abcam; 1:500), Plk1 (208G4;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; 1:200), or CIP2A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:200) and secondary antibodies such as
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594
(Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted in medium containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and images were
then obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscope
(LSM 710; Carl Zeiss, Inc.). All images were processed by using
ZEN 2009 Light Edition (Carl Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop CS4.
Immunohistochemistry
Human tissue microarrays were purchased from two commercially available tissue arrays [SuperBioChips (cat. numbers:
CC, CCN, CD, CDN, CQ, CQN, CZA, and BB) and AccuMax (cat.
numbers: A206III and A206V)]. Tissue arrays were able to
collect up to 142 lung cancer, 59 gastric cancer, 59 colon
cancer, and 55 cervical cancer specimens, along with several
matched normal tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was
conducted with anti-CIP2A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novus
Biologicals; 1:100), anti-Plk1 rabbit polyclonal antibody
(Abcam; 1:100), or anti-phospho-Plk1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam; 1:100). Immunostaining was detected by the
avidin–biotin–peroxidase method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The staining scoring was
evaluated on a scale of 0–3. Staining intensity was scored as
follows: 0 (no visible staining), 1þ (faint staining), 2þ (moderate staining), and 3þ (strong staining; Supplementary
Fig. S1A).
Immunoprecipitation and Strep pull-down
Immunoprecipitation was conducted as previously
described (20). Brieﬂy, cells were lysed by NP-40 lysis buffer
and the lysates were then precipitated with negative control
mouse antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or mouse
monoclonal antibody against either CIP2A or Plk1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were collected using
protein G-Sepharose and washed three times and SDS sample

buffer was then added. Strep-tagged CIP2A proteins were
pulled down by using Strep-Tactin beads (IBA TAGnologies),
washed ﬁve times, and eluted with desthiobiotin (IBA TAGnologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The eluted
samples were size-fractionated by electrophoresis and
detected using immunoblotting.
Cell-cycle analysis
HeLa cells released from double thymidine block/release or
nocodazole block were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS, and
ﬁxed with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were incubated
with 50 mg/mL propidium iodide and 100 mg/mL RNase at 37 C
for 30 minutes and then analyzed with a FACScan ﬂow
cytometer (Becton Dickson).
Live imaging of FUCCI-expressing cells
FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells (21) were transduced with
control or CIP2A shRNA lentivirus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells synchronized by a double thymidine block were released with fresh
medium and time-lapse images were acquired at 30-minute
intervals using confocal and phase-contrast microscopy (Carl
Zeiss, Inc.).
In vivo ubiquitination assay
Cells transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and empty or
CIP2A-Myc vector were synchronized at the G1–S border by a
double thymidine block and then released. Eight hours after
release, the cells were treated with MG132 for 3 hours and then
analyzed for ubiquitination in vivo, as previously described
(22). Brieﬂy, the cells were lysed by incubation with 2 volumes
of TBS containing 2% SDS at 95 C for 10 minutes. After adding
eight volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS, lysates were sonicated
for 2 minutes and then precleared with protein G-Sepharose.
The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Plk1
antibody (Abcam) coupled to protein G-Sepharose. The beads
were washed with 0.5 mol/L LiCl in TBS, washed twice with
TBS, and immunoblotted using anti-HA antibody.
Plk1 kinase assay
Recombinant active His-Plk1 (produced in Sf-9 cells) was
purchased from R&D Systems. Strep-tagged CIP2A from 293
cells expressing Strep-CIP2A was puriﬁed by the Strep-tag
puriﬁcation method. Various concentration ratios of puriﬁed
Strep-CIP2A protein (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg) were subjected to in
vitro kinase assay with active His-Plk1 (0.1 mg). In vitro kinase
assays were conducted in kinase buffer (20 mmol/L HEPES, pH
7.5, 150 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2
mmol/L dithiothreitol, 5 mmol/L NaF, and 0.2 mmol/L Na3
VO4) supplemented with 50 mmol/L ATP and 2.5 mCi of [g-32P]
ATP at 30 C for 30 minutes in the presence of 2 mg dephosphorylated a-casein (Sigma). The reaction mixture was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. BI2536 (Selleck
Chemicals) was used as a positive control to inhibit Plk1
activity.
In situ proximity ligation assay
In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) was conducted as
previously described (23). Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed HeLa cells

www.aacrjournals.org

were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed, and
blocked with blocking solution (Olink Bioscience). Antigenretrieved normal and cancer tissues (SuperBioChips) were
incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, washed, and blocked
with blocking solution. Mouse monoclonal anti-CIP2A antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:200) together with
rabbit polyclonal anti–phospho-Plk1 (Thr210) antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc.; 1:100) or rabbit polyclonal antiCIP2A antibody (Novus Biologicals; 1:200) together with mouse
monoclonal anti-Plk1 antibody (Abcam; 1:300) were used for
the proximity ligation reaction. The assay was conducted
according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Duolink
Detection Kit with a pair of nucleotide-labeled secondary
antibodies (rabbit PLA probe MINUS and mouse PLA probe
PLUS; Olink Bioscience). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst,
which was included in the PLA reagent kit. Ampliﬁed PLA
signals, represented as red ﬂuorescent dots, were analyzed
using confocal microscopy and quantiﬁed using CellProﬁler
software (available at www.cellproﬁler.org).
Statistical analysis
The correlation between CIP2A and Plk1 immunointensity
was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation test. The twotailed Student t test was conducted to analyze statistical
differences between groups. P values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were
conducted using Excel and XLSTAT software.

Results
Regulation of CIP2A during cell-cycle progression
To investigate the role of CIP2A in cell division, we ﬁrst
examined CIP2A protein expression during different phases of
the cell cycle in HeLa cells synchronized by using a double
thymidine and thymidine–nocodazole block protocol (Fig. 1A).
The expression of CIP2A increased during the G2–M phase (Fig.
1A, left) and decreased during the exit from mitosis (Fig. 1A,
right). Moreover, most of the CIP2A protein expressed was
localized in the cytoplasm during interphase, and, as cells
passed from the S-phase to the G2–M phase, CIP2A was initially
concentrated in the pericentrosomal region and then clearly
localized at spindle poles during mitosis, as shown by immunoﬂuorescence analysis (Fig. 1B). Notably, CIP2A was enriched
in the nucleus during entry into mitosis (Fig. 1B and C). These
cell cycle–dependent expression and localization patterns of
CIP2A were also observed in two other cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
To further understand the cell cycle–dependent regulation
of CIP2A, we used cells that expressed high or very low
amounts of CIP2A, that is, H1299 lung cancer cells or Hs68
normal ﬁbroblasts, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Because it has been well established that PTEN induces G1
arrest in most types of cancer cells (24, 25) and that Plk1
depletion causes G2–M arrest but not apoptosis in Hs68 cells
(8), we overexpressed a WT PTEN construct in H1299 cells
(PTEN null) or depleted Plk1 with siRNA in Hs68 cells. Ectopic
overexpression of WT PTEN suppressed CIP2A expression and
caused G1 arrest in H1299 cells (Fig. 1D). On the other hand,
CIP2A expression was obviously increased in Plk1-depleted

Figure 1. CIP2A is a cell-cycle regulated protein. A, HeLa cells were synchronized by either a double thymidine block or nocodazole block, released into fresh
medium at indicated time points, and then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins. Synchronization and progression
through the cell cycle was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. B, HeLa cells were stained with anti-CIP2A antibody (green),
anti-pericentrin antibody (red), and DAPI (DNA, blue). C, an enlarged single-cell image from HeLa cells stained with anti-CIP2A antibody (green)

control (Ctrl) siRNA or Plk1 siRNA. D and E, after transfection for 48 hours, PTEN-induced G1 arrest or Plk1 depletion–induced G2–M arrest was analyzed
by immunoblotting with antibodies against the indicated proteins or by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, respectively. F, Hs68 cells were
stained with anti-CIP2A antibody (green) and anti–phospho-H3 antibody (red) or anti-cyclin B1 antibody (red) with DAPI (blue). Data shown represent typical
results from at least four independent experiments. Scale bars, 10 mm.

and mitotic Hs68 cells (Fig. 1E and F). PTEN overexpression or
Plk1 depletion did not affect cell viability (Supplementary
Fig. S2D). Likewise, we also observed that irradiation, which
induces G1 or G2–M arrest in a p53-dependent manner (26),
triggered a reduction in CIP2A expression in H460 cells (p53
WT), but not in H1299 cells (p53 null; Supplementary Fig. S2E).
Taken together, these results indicated that the expression
and localization of CIP2A were associated with cell-cycle
progression.
CIP2A was required for mitotic progression independent
of PP2A
Next, we designed three siRNAs against different regions of
CIP2A and found that two of them (#1 and #2 siRNAs) were
highly efﬁcient in silencing the CIP2A gene, but #3 siRNA
exhibited poor efﬁciency (Fig. 2A, top). In addition, we constructed a CIP2A siRNA-resistant rescue vector (CIP2Arv)
against the #1 siRNA to use in rescue experiments (Fig. 2A,
bottom).
To examine the role of CIP2A during mitosis, cells were
arrested at mitosis using nocodazole (Fig. 2B). Interestingly,
mitotic arrest was clearly reduced in CIP2A-depleted cells,
similar to MAD2 depletion or CHFR overexpression, which

6670

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

are known to cause reduction of the mitotic index by
inducing defects in the spindle checkpoint (1, 27) or the
activation of the prophase checkpoint (28) under nocodazole
treatment, respectively (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, mitotic phosphoproteins, assessed by Western blotting with anti–
phospho-MPM2 antibody, were downregulated in CIP2Adepleted (#1 siRNA), MAD2-depleted, or CHFR-overexpressing cells compared with cells transfected with control
siRNA or poor-efﬁciency CIP2A siRNA (#3; Fig. 2C). Importantly, the reduced mitotic index was restored by overexpression of CIP2Arv, excluding off-target effects of siRNA
(Fig. 2D and E). A high percentage of MAD2-depleted cells
contained multilobed nuclei, whereas CHFR-induced premitotic arrest did not affect nuclear morphology (Fig. 2F and
G); these results are consistent with those of previous
studies (27, 28). Interestingly, the presence of normal interphase nuclei in CIP2A-depleted cells suggested that, similar
to CHFR overexpression, CIP2A depletion induced premitotic arrest (Fig. 2F and G).
Because CIP2A has been shown to inhibit c-Myc–associated
PP2A (9), we speculated that CIP2A-mediated cell-cycle regulation may be dependent on PP2A. Unexpectedly, both inhibition of PP2A either by PP2A-speciﬁc siRNAs or okadaic

CIP2A Regulates Plk1 Stability and Activity during Mitosis

Figure 2. CIP2A depletion blocks nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest. A, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs (top) or transfected
with control (Ctrl) siRNA, CIP2A.1 siRNA, or both CIP2A.1 siRNA and CIP2Arv (bottom) for 48 hours and then analyzed by immunoblotting with
anti-CIP2A antibody. B, C, F, and G, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs or Flag-CHFR vector for 36 hours and then incubated with
100 ng/mL nocodazole for 16 hours. MAD2 siRNA or the Flag-CHFR vector was used for a positive control of spindle checkpoint regulation or
premitotic regulation, respectively. Cells were analyzed by light microscopy (B, left), ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (B, right), or
immunoblotted with antibodies against the indicated proteins (C). D and E, HeLa cells were transfected with control (Ctrl) siRNA, CIP2A.1 siRNA, or
both CIP2A.1 siRNA and CIP2Arv for 48 hours and then incubated with 100 ng/mL nocodazole for 16 hours. Nocodazole-treated cells were
stained with anti-CIP2A antibody (green) and anti–phospho-H3 antibody (red) with DAPI (blue; D). E, the mitotic index was determined by the
percentage of phospho-H3–positive cells (bottom) or by FACS (top) and was quantiﬁed using CellProﬁler software (300 cells for each data point,

acid treatment and activation of PP2A by forskolin treatment
were not able to rescue the CIP2A-depletion phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3C). Consistent with this, depletion or activation of PP2A did not rescue reduced mitotic
phosphorylation due to CIP2A depletion (Supplementary
Fig. S3B and S3D). Along with the observation that CIP2A
depletion induced premitotic arrest, these results indicated
that CIP2A was required for mitotic progression independent of PP2A.
CIP2A was required for timely entry into mitosis and
proper completion of mitosis
To further investigate the role of CIP2A during mitotic
progression, cells were transfected with CIP2A siRNAs in the
interval between the two thymidine blocks and then released
into the cell cycle with or without nocodazole (Fig. 3A, top).
CIP2A depletion retarded the entry of synchronized cells into
mitosis compared with the control cells, regardless of noco-

dazole treatment (Fig. 3A, bottom). Moreover, the accumulation of mitotic phosphoproteins and mitotic regulators, such
as cyclin B1 and Plk1, was delayed in CIP2A-depleted cells,
whereas the expression of cyclin A, which ordinarily accumulates in S and G2 phases, was elevated (Fig. 3B, bottom).
However, CIP2A depletion did not signiﬁcantly affect the
expression of c-Myc protein (Fig. 3B, bottom) or the kinetics
of DNA replication during cell-cycle progression (Fig. 3B, top).
To distinguish cells in the S–G2–M (green) phase from the G1
-phase (red), we used a FUCCI. FUCCI can help visualize the
dynamics of cell-cycle progression by harnessing the ubiquitination oscillators that control cell-cycle transitions (21).
CIP2A was stably depleted by transducing FUCCI-expressing
HeLa cells with a lentiviral vector expressing CIP2A shRNA
(Fig. 3C, right). Knockdown of CIP2A delayed entry of the cells
into mitosis and the G1-phase by approximately 2 to 3 hours
and resulted in a much more irregular entry into mitosis
compared with that in cells expressing control shRNA (Fig.

3C, left, and D). Although CIP2A depletion primarily prevented
mitotic entry, prolonged culture allowed delayed entry into
mitosis. Therefore, we next asked whether CIP2A depletion
caused mitotic defects. After 72 hours, CIP2A depletion signiﬁcantly increased aberrant micronuclei, and this phenotype
was rescued by cotransfection with CIP2Arv (Fig. 3E and F). In
addition, CIP2A depletion caused multiple mitotic abnormalities (Fig. 3G and H), including the formation of multipolar
spindles (Fig. 3H, ii), monopolar spindles (Fig. 3H, iii), misaligned chromosomes (Fig. 3H, iv and v), and lagging chromosomes (Fig. 3H, vi). Taken together, these results suggested that

CIP2A was required for timely entry into mitosis and the
proper completion of mitosis.
CIP2A bound to Plk1 during mitosis
Because the stage-speciﬁc activity of mitotic kinases is
crucial for proper cell-cycle progression (1) and because CIP2A
is required for mitotic entry, we screened for kinases capable of
rescuing CIP2A depletion mitotic delay. We overexpressed
several mitotic kinases, including Aurora A, Aurora B, Plk1,
and Nek2A, and among all of these kinases, only Plk1 rescued
the CIP2A-depletion phenotype (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, we

hypothesized that CIP2A regulated Plk1 activity during cellcycle progression. To test this, we conducted coimmunoprecipitation assays with CIP2A and Plk1. Interestingly, CIP2A
interacted with endogenous Plk1 (Fig. 4C), and this interaction
was particularly apparent during mitosis (Fig. 4D). To further
dissect the interaction between CIP2A and Plk1, cells were
transfected with Strep-tagged CIP2A with various Flag-tagged
Plk1 constructs, including WT, polo-box–mutant (three point
mutations at W414F, V415A, and L427A, which are known to

Plk1. In addition, the interaction was reduced in FAA Plk1
compared with WT or C-terminal Plk1 (Fig. 4E), indicating that
the CIP2A–Plk1 interaction required the intact PBD of Plk1. To
further conﬁrm this interaction, in situ PLAs were conducted to
visualize the in vivo interactions between two proteins. Notably, positive signals indicating interactions between CIP2A and
Plk1 were clearly observed in mitotic cells compared with
interphase cells (Fig. 4F and G). Moreover, these signals began
to increase from prophase, peaked at prometaphase, and then
gradually decreased in anaphase (Fig. 4H and I). Taken together, these results showed that CIP2A interacted directly with
Plk1 during mitosis.

The CIP2A–Plk1 interaction enhanced the stability and
activity of Plk1 during mitosis
Because Plk1 directly interacted with CIP2A (Fig. 4) and its
expression was decreased in CIP2A-depleted cells (Fig. 3B;
Supplementary Fig. S3B), we hypothesized that Plk1 stability
may be affected by CIP2A during mitosis. To investigate this
possibility, we examined the half-life of mitotic Plk1 in the
presence of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) or proteasome
(MG132) inhibitors. CIP2A depletion signiﬁcantly reduced the
stability of Plk1 protein after cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5A
and B). Interestingly, inhibition of the proteasome with MG132
blocked Plk1 degradation in CIP2A-depleted cells (Fig. 5C),
supporting that CIP2A has a role in the stabilization of Plk1.
Indeed, ectopic overexpression of CIP2A reduced the ubiquitination of Plk1 in mitotic cells (Fig. 5D). Because Plk1 degradation is mediated by APC/C-Cdh1 or -Cdc20, we determined
which of these cofactors were involved in the regulation of Plk1
stability in CIP2A-depleted cells. Notably, Plk1 levels in CIP2A-

depleted cells were restored by Cdh1 depletion, but not by
Cdc20 depletion (Fig. 5E), indicating that CIP2A stabilized Plk1
by interfering with APC/C-Cdh1–mediated degradation during
mitosis.
Unexpectedly, we also observed that CIP2A depletion signiﬁcantly reduced g-tubulin recruitment and microtubule
organization during mitosis (data not shown). Because Plk1
activity is critical for centrosome maturation during mitosis
(6, 30), we considered the possibility that CIP2A depletion may
affect Plk1 activity and stability. To test this possibility, we
measured the level of Plk1 phosphorylation at Thr210, indicative of Plk1 activation, and Plk1 kinase activity. Notably, Plk1
phosphorylation and kinase activity were dramatically
decreased during mitosis in CIP2A-depleted cells compared
with control cells, despite the increase in total Plk1 (Fig. 5F and
Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). To further conﬁrm this, we
conducted in vitro kinase assays using Strep-CIP2A (puriﬁed
from 293 cells) and His-Plk1 (obtained from Sf9 cells) protein.

Figure 5. CIP2A regulates the stability and activity of Plk1 during mitosis. A, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, synchronized, and treated
with cycloheximide (CHX), which was added 7 hours after release from G1–S. At the indicated times after the addition of cycloheximide, cells were
analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, the levels of Plk1 were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software (n ¼ 3; error bars,  SD,  , P < 0.01). C, at
7 hours after release from G1–S, cells were treated with MG132 for 3 hours. D, cells cotransfected with vectors for HA-ubiquitin (Ub) and empty or CIP2A-Myc
were released from G1–S for 1 hour (interphase) or 7 hours (mitosis) and MG132 was added for 3 hours. Lysates of the cells were immunoprecipitated with antiPlk1 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. E, HeLa cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs targeting CIP2A, Cdh1, or Cdc20 were
synchronized at the G1–S phase, released for 10 hours and then analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. F, HeLa cells transfected with
control (Ctrl) siRNA or CIP2A.1 siRNA were synchronized by a double thymidine block and released into fresh medium. Cells were analyzed by immunoblotting
with the indicated antibodies. G, puriﬁed Strep-CIP2A protein (1 mg) incubated with or without recombinant His-Plk1 (0.1 mg) was used as the control to exclude
the possibility that puriﬁed Strep-CIP2A protein was associated with kinases that can phosphorylate casein (left). Recombinant His-Plk1 (0.1 mg) was
incubated with 50 mmol/L BI2536 alone or with serial concentrations of puriﬁed Strep-CIP2A proteins (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg) for 30 minutes (right). Plk1 activity was
determined by in vitro kinase assay using casein as a substrate. Data shown represent typical results from at least three independent experiments.

CIP2A Regulates Plk1 Stability and Activity during Mitosis

Consistent with the decrease in Plk1 activity by CIP2A depletion, CIP2A protein noticeably enhanced Plk1 activity and
autophosphorylation (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, we observed that
CIP2A-depleted cells were less sensitive to BI2536, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Plk1, than control cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5), supporting that Plk1 possessed CIP2A-dependent activity.
Taken together, these results suggested that the CIP2A–Plk1
interaction increased both the activity and stability of Plk1
during mitosis.
In vivo correlation between CIP2A and Plk1 in human
cancers
To assess the physiologic relevance of CIP2A-mediated Plk1
regulation in human cancers, we evaluated CIP2A and Plk1 expression using tissue microarrays derived from distinct human
cancer tissues (see the Materials and Methods for details). Consistent with other reports, CIP2A and Plk1 were signiﬁcantly
increased in lung, gastric (stomach), colon, and cervical cancers
(Fig. 6A). Importantly, the staining regions of these two proteins
in serial sections of the same tissues were strikingly similar (Fig.

6B–D). Similar staining patterns were also observed in various
cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, we found
that CIP2A expression was strongly correlated with Plk1 expression in four common types of cancer tissues (Supplementary
Table S1; lung cancer, r ¼ 0.682; cervical cancer, r ¼ 0.77; gastric
cancer, r ¼ 0.787; and colon cancer, r ¼ 0.735). Finally, we veriﬁed the in vivo interactions of these two proteins in cancer and
normal tissues by in situ PLA. Remarkably, positive signals were
predominantly detected in cancer tissues compared with their
normal counterparts (Fig. 6E and F). Of the normal tissues tested,
positive signals were also detected in stomach and colon tissues,
both highly proliferative tissues, but to a lesser extent than in
corresponding cancer tissues (Fig. 6E). Collectively, our data provided strong evidence for the physiologic relevance of CIP2Amediated Plk1 regulation in a wide variety of human cancers.

Discussion
In this study, we showed a novel regulatory function for
CIP2A during cell-cycle progression. Although CIP2A is a wellknown tumor marker and potent oncogene in a variety of

tumors, the regulatory functions of CIP2A during cell-cycle
progression have not been well studied. We showed for the
ﬁrst time that CIP2A controlled mitotic progression by
directly interacting with the mitotic kinase Plk1, thereby
stabilizing and promoting Plk1 activity. We also showed that
CIP2A and Plk1 expression was tightly correlated in a large
variety of cancers. Therefore, these ﬁndings suggested that
CIP2A plays an important role in ﬁne-tuning Plk1 expression
and ultimately contributes to malignant cell growth and
tumor formation.
Our results revealed that CIP2A was associated with cellcycle regulation. Similar to our observations, several lines of
evidence have indicated that cell cycle–arresting agents/conditions modulate CIP2A expression in various cancer cells. For
example, serum starvation reduces CIP2A expression in gastric
cancer cells and doxorubicin treatment reduces it in p53proﬁcient cells but not in p53-deﬁcient cells (31, 32). Moreover,
several cell cycle–promoting factors, such as c-Myc and E2F1,
have been reported to stimulate CIP2A expression (12, 33). In
addition to the cell cycle–dependent expression of CIP2A, we
also found that CIP2A exhibited nuclear and centrosomal
localization during mitosis. Consistent with this observation,
a recent report has shown that cytoplasmic CIP2A shuttles
into the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export factor (34), suggesting that the
nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of CIP2A may be important
for mitotic progression. Furthermore, we showed that CIP2A
is required for mitotic progression. Depletion of CIP2A and
overexpression of CHFR, which regulates entry into mitosis by
ubiquitinating Plk1 upon microtubule poisoning (28), caused
the same phenotype of Plk1-dependent premitotic arrest,
albeit via different mechanisms, thus supporting the occurrence of CIP2A-mediated Plk1 regulation during mitotic
progression. Similarly, a recent report showed that depletion
of CIP2A disrupted the cell cycle in human ovarian cancer
cells (35). In terms of c-Myc regulation, many reports have
observed reduced levels of c-Myc in CIP2A-depleted cells
(9, 12, 32, 35, 36). These studies were inconsistent with our
current observation that CIP2A depletion did not affect c-Myc
levels or the kinetics of DNA replication; however, it should be
noted that these previous reports examined c-Myc levels at 72
hours after CIP2A depletion, while we observed c-Myc expression after relatively short-term depletion. In addition, a previous report showed that S-phase synchronization in thymidine/aphidicolin-treated gastric cancer cells did not affect
CIP2A expression compared with unsynchronized cells, suggesting that cell-cycle activity is not associated with c-Myc–
mediated regulation of CIP2A expression in gastric cancer cells
(12). Therefore, it is likely that CIP2A-dependent cell-cycle
regulation is independent of c-Myc.
Our data indicated that CIP2A blocks ubiquitin-dependent
proteolysis of mitotic Plk1, similar to previous studies that have
shown the CIP2A-dependent proteolytic degradation of c-Myc
(9). On a molecular level, R337, located near the C-terminal
region of Plk1, acts as a functional destruction box (4). Given
that CIP2A interacted with the C-terminal region of Plk1 and
that ectopic overexpression of CIP2A inhibited Plk1 ubiquitination, it is possible that the CIP2A–Plk1 interaction could

6676

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

hinder the reaction between APC/C-Cdh1 and the destruction
box on Plk1, thereby decreasing Plk1 ubiquitination. APC/CCdh1 is thought to be active during late M and G1-phase (2).
However, recent observations have indicated that APC/C-Cdh1
is also active during early mitosis (37). Thus, the CIP2A–Plk1
interaction could also protect Plk1 from APC/C-Cdh1–dependent proteolysis throughout mitosis.
In addition to the regulation of Plk1 stability, we also found
that CIP2A regulated Plk1 activity during mitosis. The
increased autophosphorylation and activity of Plk1 induced
by the addition of CIP2A protein may suggest that the interaction of CIP2A–Plk1 via PBD could relieve the autoinhibitory
interaction of PBD with the kinase domain of Plk1 (3, 4). The
Plk1 PBD plays a pivotal role in mediating both the kinase
activity and localization of Plk1 (3, 4). Interestingly, we also
found that CIP2A depletion increased Plk1 mislocalization
during mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S6). Proper localization of
Plk1 is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Plk1
during mitosis (3, 4). Thus, it is also likely that decreased
activity of Plk1 in CIP2A-depleted cells may be caused by
mislocalization of Plk1.
CIP2A is a clinically relevant prognostic marker in many
types of cancers. For example, high CIP2A expression predicts
poor survival in several types of cancers (10, 13, 14, 36, 38).
Furthermore, recent reports suggest that CIP2A expression is
associated with resistance to several anticancer drugs (14,
15, 31). Likewise, it has been well established that Plk1 is
upregulated in tumors and has been validated as a therapeutic
target in many types of cancers (8). In addition, Plk1 plays a key
role to mitotic reentry following DNA damage-induced arrest, a
mechanism contributing to tumor resistance against anticancer drugs (39–41). Our immunohistochemical and PLA analyses indicated that CIP2A tightly cooperated with mitotic Plk1
in a wide variety of human cancers. Thus, our ﬁndings suggested that the CIP2A–Plk1 complex may serve as a potential
prognostic marker for poor survival and tumor resistance
against anticancer drugs. In addition, small molecules interfering with CIP2A–Plk1 binding or triggering CIP2A downregulation could be effective as antimitotic drugs for cancer
therapy.
How can CIP2A modulate mitotic Plk1 through multiple
mechanisms? CIP2A has multiple predicated domains,
including armadillo-like, transmembrane, leucine zipper,
and coiled-coil domains (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Interestingly, under nonreducing conditions, the molecular mass of
endogenous CIP2A was approximately 360 kDa (Supplementary Fig. S7B), suggesting that endogenous CIP2A forms a
multimeric complex. Scaffold proteins, which usually form
large complexes, are crucial regulator of particular signaling
pathways, acting by tethering signal components, localizing
these components to speciﬁc areas, coordinating positive or
negative feedback signals, and protecting the signaling
components (42). This study suggested that CIP2A regulated
mitotic Plk1 via multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of stability, activity, and localization. On the basis of
these aspects, one reasonable answer to the question stated
earlier is that CIP2A is a transient mitotic scaffold for Plk1
during mitosis.
