ABSTRACT
Trop-2 is a novel target for ADC therapy because of its high expression by many
solid cancers. The rational development of IMMU-132 represents a paradigm shift
as an ADC that binds a well-known moderately-cytotoxic drug, SN-38, to the antiTrop-2 antibody. In vitro and in vivo studies show enhanced efficacy, while there
is a gradual release of SN-38 that contributes to the overall effect. IMMU-132 is
most efficacious at a high drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of 7.6:1, which does not affect
binding and pharmacokinetics. It targets up to 136-fold more SN-38 to a human
cancer xenograft than irinotecan, SN-38′s prodrug. IMMU-132 delivers SN-38 in its
most active, non-glucuronidated form, which may explain the lower frequency of
severe diarrhea than with irinotecan. Thus, this ADC, carrying a moderately-toxic drug
targeting Trop-2 represents a novel cancer therapeutic that is showing promising
activity in patients with several metastatic cancer types, including triple-negative
breast cancer, non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancers.

cancer cells [8–10]. The Trop-2/TACSTD2 gene has
been cloned [8] and found to encode a transmembrane
Ca++-signal transducer [1, 11]. Functionally, it is linked
to cell migration and anchorage-independent growth,
with higher expression in a variety of human epithelial
cancers, including breast, lung, gastric, colorectal,
pancreatic, prostatic, cervical, head-and-neck, and ovarian
carcinomas, compared to normal tissues [2, 7, 12, 13]. The
increased expression of Trop-2 is reported to be necessary
and sufficient for stimulation of cancer growth [13],
while a bi-cistronic cyclin D1-Trop-2 mRNA chimera
is an oncogene [14]. Importantly, elevated expression
is associated with more aggressive disease and a poor
prognosis in several cancer types [12, 14–19], including
breast cancer [20, 21]. Increased Trop-2 mRNA is a strong
predictor of poor survival and lymph node metastasis in
patients with invasive ductal breast cancers, and KaplanMeier survival curves show that breast cancer patients
with high Trop-2 expression have a significantly shorter
survival [21]. Using genomic analyses of breast cancers,

INTRODUCTION
A novel target in multiple solid cancers for an
ADC is trophoblast cell-surface antigen, or Trop-2, also
known as tumor-associated calcium signal transducer
(TACSTD2), epithelial glycoprotein-1 (EGP-1),
gastrointestinal tumor-associated antigen (GA733-1), and
surface marker 1 (M1S1) [1, 2]. The expression, role, and
function of Trop-2 have been of interest since about 1990,
when our anti-Trop-2 monoclonal antibody was shown to
bind to many different cancer types [3, 4]. It is encoded by
a single-copy gene (TACSTD2) mapped on chromosome
1p32 [5], which hybridizes to a single 1.8-kb mRNA
encoding the GA733-1 gene [6]. The 36 kDa nascent
polypeptide, which is post-translationally modified by
N-linked glycosylation, forms a type-1 transmembrane
protein that is distinct from EpCAM (EGP-2) [3, 7].
First described as a cell-surface glycoprotein of a human
trophoblast cell, Trop-2 was believed at that time to
be involved in regulating the growth and invasion of

it was proposed that Trop-2 is a potentially attractive target
for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [22], which we
reported with RS7 anti-Trop-2 antibody conjugated to a
radionuclide [23].
We are assessing the clinical role of a new Trop2-targeting ADC using the humanized RS7 antibody
as a potentially improved treatment for diverse
epithelial cancers, including TNBC (http://ClinicalTrials.
gov number NCT01631552). This ADC, designated
IMMU-132, is important because it represents a significant
departure from the current ADC paradigm of using a
stably-linked ultratoxic drug by: (i) use of a moderatelytoxic drug, SN-38, (ii) conjugation of drug to monoclonal
antibody (mAb) at a high ratio (~8:1) without affecting
antibody targeting and pharmacokinetics, (iii) utilization
of a pH-sensitive, cleavable linker designed to impart
cytotoxic activity to both target and bystander cells via
ADC internalization and local release of the free drug at
the tumor, (iv) allowing high doses of the ADC over a
prolonged times without provoking an immune response,
and (v) showing reduced toxicities, especially a lower
incidence of severe diarrhea, which is common for
topoisomerase inhibitors.
In this article, we report that Trop-2 is an attractive
target for an ADC, especially since RS7 internalizes
rapidly into target cancer cells [4]. Preclinical results,
supported by an ongoing clinical trial, highlight the
attributes distinguishing this anti-Trop-2-targeting ADC as
a novel agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed/
refractory, metastatic solid cancers [24], especially triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) [25]. We also demonstrate,
for the first time, that a moderately-toxic drug can be
conjugated to a cancer-targeting antibody and show
an improved therapeutic index that is predictive of this
ADC’s clinical activity.

camptothecin, irinotecan (7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) (Fig 1), which
is therapeutically active in colorectal, lung, cervical,
and ovarian cancers [26]. An important advantage for
selecting SN-38 is that the drug’s in-vivo pharmacology
is well known. Irinotecan must be cleaved by esterases
to form SN-38, which is 2–3 orders of magnitude more
potent than irinotecan, with activity in the low nanomolar
range [27]. At physiological pH, camptothecins exist in an
equilibrium comprising the more active lactone form and
the less active (10% potency) open carboxylic acid form
[28, 29].
The design of the SN-38 derivative used in IMMU132, CL2A-SN-38 [2, 30, 31], addressed multiple
challenges in using this drug in the ADC format, and
involved the following features: (i) a short polyethylene
glycol (PEG) moiety was placed in the cross-linker to
confer aqueous solubility to this highly insoluble drug
(Fig 1B); (ii) a maleimide group was incorporated for fast
thiol-maleimide conjugation to mildly reduced antibody;
(iii) a benzylcarbonate site provided a pH-mediated
cleavage site to release the drug from the linker; and
(iv) importantly, the crosslinker was attached to SN-38′s
20-hydroxy position, which kept the lactone ring of the
drug from opening to the less active carboxylic acid form
under physiological conditions [29, 32]. The synthesis of
SN-38 derivatives and the conjugation of CL2A-SN-38 to
mildly reduced hRS7 IgG has been described previously
[2, 30, 31]. The limited reduction procedure breaks
only the interchain disulfide bridges between the heavyheavy and heavy-light chains, but not the intra-domain
disulfides, generating 8 site-specific thiols per antibody
molecule. It is then conjugated to CL2A-SN-38, purified
by diafiltration, and lyophilized for storage. During
manufacturing, conditions are adjusted to minimize any
loss of SN-38 from IMMU-132, with the final lyophilized
product consistently having < 1% free SN-38 when
reconstituted. However, when placed in serum and held at
37°C, SN-38 is released from the conjugate with a half-life
of ~1 day (Fig 1C).
This represents a marked departure from the two
recently reported ADCs utilizing ultratoxic drugs, where
their linkers maintain a relatively high degree of stability
in serum [33, 34]. The release of SN-38 appears to be an
important feature of IMMU-132, with this type of linker
selected based on efficacy studies that tested SN-38
conjugated to a variety of linkers that had different rates
of SN-38 release, ranging from ~10 h release half-life to
being highly stable [30, 31]. Optimal therapeutic activity
was found with a conjugate having an intermediate release
rate in serum of ~1 day. We subsequently improved the
manufacturing process for this type of linker, designated
CL2A [2], and then again compared the efficacy of
this conjugate to another stably-linked anti-Trop-2
conjugate that was designed to release SN-38 only under
lysosomal conditions (i.e., in the presence of cathepsin
B and pH 5.0) at a rate similar to that as CL2A-linked

RESULTS
Humanized anti-Trop-2 antibody
The RS7 antibody was developed against a human
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, binding specifically
to a~45 kDa glycoprotein initially denoted EGP-1 [3, 4].
It was later determined to be identical to an antigen
defined earlier by Lipinski et al. [9] as Trop-2, which is
now the more commonly used designation. The murine
anti-Trop-2 mAb, designated RS7-3G11 (or RS7) [4], was
humanized to reduce immunogenicity for clinical use.
Antigen-binding for Trop-2+ cell lines, as well as rapid
cell internalization, were preserved in the ADC (e.g., KD
is 0.564 ± 0.055 nM and 0.658 ± 0.140 nM, hRS7 IgG and
IMMU-132, respectively) [2].

SN-38 under identical conditions. In animal models, the
anti-Trop-2 conjugate prepared with the CL2A linker
yielded better therapeutic responses than when SN-38
was linked stably, indicating that even antibodies that
internalized quickly benefitted when SN-38 was allowed
to be released in serum with a half-life of ~1 day [35].
Since clinical studies with radiolabeled antibodies have
found the antibodies localize in tumors within a few hours,
reaching peak concentrations within 1 day [36], selectively
enhanced concentrations of SN-38 are delivered locally in
the tumor through internalization of the intact conjugate,
extracellular release of the free drug, or both mechanisms
in concert.

Five clinical lots of IMMU-132 were evaluated
by hydrophobic interaction HPLC (HIC-HPLC),
which resolved three peaks representing species
with DARs of 6, 7 and 8, with the greatest fraction
comprising a DAR = 8 (Fig 2). IMMU-132 was
produced consistently by this manufacturing process,
with an overall DAR (DARAVE) of 7.60 ± 0.03 among
five clinical lots (Table 1). HIC-HPLC results were
confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) (Table 2). The analysis showed that  > 99%
of the 8 available sulfhydryl groups were coupled

There were no unsubstituted [or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)

is slightly less than 8 because a small amount of SN-38
is liberated from the linker during manufacturing. Once
prepared and lyophilized, IMMU-132 has been stable for

expression
was
determined
by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in several tissue microarrays
of human tumor specimens. In one microarray containing
31 TNBC specimens, as well as 15 hormone-receptor- or
HER-2-positive breast cancers, positive staining occurred
in over 95% of the tumors, with 3+ staining in 65% of
the cases. IHC staining of two TNBC specimens with
3+ staining is shown in Fig 4.
Table 3 lists 6 human breast cancer cell lines,
including four TNBC, showing their surface expression
of Trop-2 and sensitivity to SN-38. Trop-2 surface
expression in 5 of the 6 cell lines exceeded 90,000 copies
per cell. SN-38 potency ranged from 2 to 6 nM in 5 of the
6 cell lines, with MCF-7 having the lowest sensitivity of
33 nM. In vitro potency for IMMU-132 is not provided,
because nearly all of the SN-38 associated with IMMU132 is released into the media during the 4-day incubation
period, and therefore its potency would be similar to that
of SN-38. A different strategy was required to illustrate
the importance of antibody targeting as a mechanism
for delivering SN-38. Antigen-positive (HCC1806) or
-negative (HCC1395) TNBC cell lines were incubated at
4°C for 30 min with either IMMU-132 or a non-binding
anti-CD20 SN-38 conjugate. The cells were then washed
to remove unbound conjugate and incubated overnight at
37°C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and then stained
with the fluorescent anti-phospho-histone H2A.X antibody
to detect dsDNA breaks by flow cytometry [38] (Table 4).
The Trop-2+ breast cancer cell line, HCC1806, when
incubated with IMMU-132, had an increase in median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) from 168 (untreated baseline)
to 546, indicating the increased presence of dsDNA
breaks, whereas the MFI for cells incubated with the nonbinding conjugate remained at baseline levels. In contrast,

Mice bearing Trop-2+ human gastric carcinoma
xenografts (NCI-N87) were given 2 treatments 7 days
apart, each with equal protein (0.5 mg) doses of IMMU132 having DARs of 6.89, 3.28, or 1.64 (Fig 3A).
Animals treated with the ADCs having a DAR of 6.89
had a significantly improved median survival time (MST)
compared to mice given ADCs with either 3.38 or 1.64
DARs (MST = 39 days vs. 25 and 21 days, respectively;
P < 0.0014). There was no difference between groups
treated with the 3.28 or 1.64 DAR conjugates and the
saline control group.
To further elucidate the importance of a higher DAR,
mice bearing NCI-N87 gastric tumors were administered
0.5 mg IMMU-132 with a DAR of 6.89:1 twice weekly
for two weeks (Fig 3B). Another group received twice the
protein (1 mg) dose of an IMMU-132 conjugate with a
DAR of 3.28. Although both groups received the same
total amount of SN-38 (36 μg) with each dosing scheme,
those treated with the 6.89 DAR conjugate inhibited tumor
growth significantly more than tumor-bearing animals
treated with the 3.28 DAR conjugate (P = 0.0227; AUC).
Additionally, treatment with the 1.64 DAR conjugate was
not significantly different than the untreated controls.
Collectively, these studies indicate that a lower DAR
reduces efficacy.
An examination of the pharmacokinetic behavior
of the fully substituted conjugate was performed in nontumor-bearing mice given 0.2 mg of IMMU-132, with
comparison to unconjugated hRS7 IgG, as well as the
reduced and then capped IgG with N-ethylmaleimide
to evaluate whether breaking the interchain disulfides
destabilizes the IgG in serum [37]. Serum was taken at

within a group was euthanized due to disease progression. An f-test was employed to determine equality of variance between groups prior
to statistical analysis of growth curves. A two-tailed t-test was used to assess statistical significance between the various treatment groups
and controls, except for the saline control, where a one-tailed t-test was used (significance at P ≤ 0.05).

results demonstrate that even in tumors that continued to
grow after exposure to SN-38 via a non-specific ADC,
a significantly enhanced therapeutic response could be
achieved when treated with the Trop-2-specific IMMU132. However, specific therapeutic effects with IMMU132 were not achieved in MDA-MB-231 (Fig 5C). As
shown previously in Table 3, this cell line had the lowest
Trop-2 levels, and also was the least sensitive to SN-38 as
a free drug. Thus, Trop-2 expression alone will not define
whether a given cell line will respond to treatment. Other
factors, such as the percentage of cells expressing the
antigen and their distribution in the tumor, in addition to
the tumor’s natural resistance to a given drug and a variety
of physiological factors, will likely govern the effects of a
targeted therapeutic in vivo.

In vivo efficacy of IMMU-132 in
TNBC xenografts
The efficacy of IMMU-132 was assessed in nude
mice bearing MDA-MB-468 TNBC tumors (Fig 5A).
IMMU-132 at a dose of 0.12 or 0.20 mg/kg SN38-equivalents (0.15 and 0.25 mg IMMU-132/dose)
induced significant tumor regression, compared to saline,
irinotecan (10 mg/kg; ~5.8 mg/kg SN-38 equivalents
by weight), or a control anti-CD20 ADC, hA20CL2A-SN-38, given at the same 2 dose levels (AUC,
P < 0.0017). Since mice convert irinotecan to SN-38
more efficiently than humans [39] (in our studies, the
conversion rate averaged ~25%), at this irinotecan dose,
~145 to 174 μg of SN-38 would be produced, while the
administered dose of IMMU-132 contained only 9.6 μg.
Nevertheless, because IMMU-132 selectively targeted
SN-38 to the tumors, it was more efficacious. These results
corroborate findings in other solid tumor models [2]
showing that specific targeting of a small amount of SN-38
to the tumor with IMMU-132 is much more effective
than a much larger dose of irinotecan, or a mixture of
hRS7 IgG with an equal amount of free SN-38 [2].
The unconjugated RS7 antibody, even at repeated
doses of 1 mg per animal, did not show any
antitumor effects [2]. However, in-vitro studies
with gynecological cancers expressing Trop-2
have indicated cell killing with the RS7 mAb by
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [15, 40–42].
Two other unconjugated anti-Trop-2 antibodies have been
reported to be active therapeutically in preclinical testing,
one as a Fab fragment [43, 44].
On therapy day 56, four of the seven tumors in mice
given 0.12 mg/kg of the hA20-CL2A-SN-38 control ADC
had progressed to the endpoint of 1.0 cm3 (Fig 5B). At
this time, these animals were treated with IMMU-132,
electing to use the higher dose of 0.2 mg/kg in an attempt
to affect the progression of these much larger tumors.
Despite the substantial size of the tumors in several
animals, all mice demonstrated a therapeutic response,
with tumors significantly smaller five weeks later (tumor
volume [TV] = 0.14 ± 0.14 cm3 vs. 0.74 ± 0.41 cm3,
respectively; P  = 0.0031, two-tailed t-test). Similarly,
we chose two animals in the irinotecan-treated group
with tumors that progressed to ~0.7 cm3 and re-treated
one with irinotecan and the other with IMMU-132
(not shown). Within 2 weeks of ending treatment, the
tumor in the irinotecan-treated animal decreased 23%
and then began to progress, while the animal treated with
IMMU-132 had a 60% decrease in tumor size. These

Mechanism of action of IMMU-132 in TNBC
The apoptotic pathway utilized by IMMU-132
was examined in the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-468,
and in the HER2+ SK-BR-3 cell line, in order to confirm
that the ADC functions on the basis of its incorporated
SN-38 (Fig 6). Both SN-38 alone and IMMU-132
mediated > 2-fold up-regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 within 24 h
in MDA-MB-468, and by 48 h, the amount of p21WAF1/Cip1
in these cells began to decrease (31% and 43% with SN-38
or IMMU-132, respectively). Interestingly, in the HER2+
SK-BR-3 tumor line, neither SN-38 nor IMMU-132
mediated the up-regulation of p21WAF1/Cip1 above
constitutive levels in the first 24 h, but as seen in MDAMB-468 cells after 48-h exposure to SN-38 or IMMU-132,
the amount of p21WAF1/Cip1 decreased > 57%. Both SN-38
and IMMU-132 resulted in cleavage of pro-caspase-3
into its active fragments within 24 h, but with the greater
degree of active fragments observed after exposure for
48 h. Of note, in both cell lines, IMMU-132 mediated a
greater degree of pro-caspase-3 cleavage, with the highest
level observed after 48 h when compared to cells exposed
to SN-38. Finally, SN-38 and IMMU-132 both mediated
poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, starting
at 24 h, with near complete cleavage after 48 h. Taken
together, these results confirm that IMMU-132 has a
mechanism of action similar to that of free SN-38 when
administered in vitro.

Delivery of SN-38 by IMMU-132 vs. irinotecan
in a human tumor xenograft model
Constitutive products derived from irinotecan or
IMMU-132 were determined in the serum and tumors of
mice implanted subcutaneously with a human pancreatic
cancer xenograft (Capan-1) and then administered
irinotecan (773  μg; SN-38 equivalents = 448 μg) and
IMMU-132 (1.0 mg; SN-38 equivalents = 16 μg).
Irinotecan cleared very rapidly from serum,

products was detected at 24 h. The AUCs over a 6-h period
were 21.0, 2.5, and 2.8 h.μg/mL for irinotecan, SN-38,
and SN-38G, respectively (SN-38 conversion in mice =
[2.5 + 2.8)/21 = 25.2%]). Animals given IMMU-132 had
much lower concentrations of free SN-38 in the serum, but
it was detected through 48 h. Free SN-38G was detected
only at 1 and 6 h, and was 3- to 7-times lower than free
SN-38.
In the Capan-1 tumors excised from irinotecantreated animals, irinotecan levels were high over 6 h,

3-fold higher (AUC  =  1.1 h.μg/g) (Fig 7B). Tumors
taken from animals given IMMU-132 did not have any
detectable free SN-38 or SN-38G, but instead, all SN-38
in the tumor was bound to IMMU-132. Importantly, since
no SN-38G was detected in the tumors, this suggests
SN-38 bound to IMMU-132 was not glucuronidated. The
AUC for SN-38 bound to IMMU-132 in these tumors was
54.3 h.μg/g, which is 136-fold higher than the amount of
SN-38 in the tumors of animals treated with irinotecan
over the 2-h period that SN-38 could be detected, even
though mice given irinotecan received 28-fold more
SN-38 equivalents than administered with IMMU-132
(i.e., 448 vs. 16 μg SN-38 equivalents, respectively).

DISCUSSION

[30, 31]. Since this initial work, we showed that a highly
stable linkage of SN-38 was significantly less effective
than the CL2A linker that has a more intermediate stability
in serum [35].
Another current tenet of ADC design is to use an
ultra-cytotoxic drug to compensate for low levels of
antibody accretion in tumors, typically 0.003 to 0.08% of
the injected dose per gram [36]. The current generation
of ultratoxic-drug conjugates has found a drug:antibody
substitution of ≤ 4:1 to be optimal, since higher ratios
adversely affected their pharmacokinetics and diminished
the therapeutic index by collateral toxicities [48]. In this
second-generation ADC technology, we elected to use
an IgG-coupling method that site-specifically links the
drug to the interchain disulfides through mild reduction
of the IgG, which exposes 8 binding sites. With the
CL2A-SN-38 linker, we achieved a DAR of 7.6:1,
with LC-MS data showing each of the 8 coupling sites
bears the CL2A linker, but apparently some SN-38 is
lost during the manufacturing procedure. Nevertheless,
95% of the CL2A linker has 7–8 SN-38 molecules. We
found subsequently that coupling to these sites does not
destabilize the antibody, which is consistent with the
findings by Rispens et al. [49], who showed the affinity of
the interaction between CH3 domains of the heavy chains
of human IgG1 is between 10−13 and 10−14 M. Conjugates
prepared with these sites substituted at higher levels also
did not compromise antibody binding, nor did it affect
pharmacokinetic properties. Indeed, we demonstrated that
conjugates prepared at the maximum substitution level
had the best therapeutic response in mouse-human tumor
xenograft models.
One of the more notable features of IMMU-132
from a tolerability perspective is that the SN-38 bound
to IgG is not glucuronidated, which is a critical step
in the detoxification of irinotecan. With irinotecan
therapy, most of the SN-38 generated is readily
converted in the liver to the inactive SN-38G form.
Estimates of the AUC for SN-38G show it is often
4.5- to 32-times higher than SN-38 [50, 51]. SN-38G’s
secretion into the bile and subsequent deconjugation by
beta-glucuronidase produced by the intestinal flora is
strongly implicated in the enterohepatic recirculation
of SN-38 and the delayed severe diarrhea observed
with irinotecan [52]. After IMMU-132 administration,
concentrations of SN-38G were very low in our animal
and clinical studies (e.g., in the serum of patients given
IMMU-132, only 20–40% of the free SN-38 levels
are in the form of SN-38G), providing strong evidence
that SN-38 bound to IgG is largely protected from
glucuronidation, even though the 10-hydroxy position of
the SN-38 is available. We speculate that low levels of
SN-38G generated by IMMU-132 contributes to the lower
incidence and intensity of diarrhea in patients receiving
this ADC compared to irinotecan therapy.

We describe a new ADC targeting Trop-2, and early
clinical results suggest it is well tolerated and effective
in patients with TNBC, as well as other Trop-2+ cancers
[25]. Due to its distinct properties, IMMU-132 represents
a second-generation ADC. Typically, ADCs require
4 broad attributes to be optimally effective [33, 34, 45,
46]: (i) selective targeting/activity; (ii) binding, affinity,
internalization, and immunogenicity of the antibody
used in the ADC; (iii) the drug, its potency, metabolism
and pharmacological disposition, and (iv) how the
drug is bound to the antibody. Target selectivity is the
most common requirement for all ADCs, since this will
play a major role in defining the therapeutic index
(ratio of toxicity to tumor vs. normal cells); the choice
of the binding epitope of the target antigen and the
binding kinetics are general challenges to every system.
Trop-2 appears to have both a high prevalence on a number
of epithelial cancers, but it is also expressed by several
normal tissues [12, 13, 47], which could have impacted
specificity. However, expression in normal tissues appears
to be lower than in cancers [15], and Trop-2 appears to be
shielded in some normal tissues by their architecture that
limits accessibility to an antibody, whereas in cancer, these
tissue barriers are compromised by the invading tumor.
Evidence of this was apparent from initial toxicological
studies in monkeys, where despite escalating IMMU-132
doses to levels leading to irinotecan-like neutropenia and
diarrhea, histopathological damage to Trop-2-expressing
normal tissues did not occur [2]. These results appear to
have been confirmed clinically, where no specific organ
toxicity has been noted in patients to-date, except for the
known toxicities of the parental compound, irinotecan
[25], which are more manageable with IMMU-132.
A generally accepted and important criterion for
ADC therapy is that the antibody should internalize,
delivering its chemotherapeutic inside the cell, where
it is usually metabolized in lysosomes. Despite IMMU132′s internalization, we believe that the linker in this
ADC, which affords local release of SN-38, is likely
another feature that sets this platform technology apart
from those using an ultratoxic drug, because the released
free drug can induce a bystander effect on neighboring
cancer cells. Indeed, having an ultratoxic agent linked
stably to the IgG is the only configuration that would
preserve a useful therapeutic window for those types of
compounds. However, using a more moderately-toxic
drug does not give the latitude to use a linker that would
release the drug too early once in the circulation. Our
group explored linkers that released SN-38 from the
conjugate with different half-lives in serum, ranging from
~10 h to a highly stable linker, but it was the linker with
the intermediate stability that provided the best therapeutic
response in mouse-human tumor xenograft models

Preventing glucuronidation of the SN-38 bound to
the antibody may also contribute to improved therapeutic
effects for SN-38 delivered to the tumor. Extracts of
tumors from animals given irinotecan found high levels
of irinotecan, with 10-fold lower concentrations of SN-38
and SN-38G. In contrast, the only SN-38 found in the
tumors of animals given IMMU-132 was SN-38 bound
to the IgG. We hypothesize that the conjugate retained in
the tumor will eventually be internalized, thereby releasing
its SN-38 payload, or SN-38 could be released outside
the tumor cell; however, it would be released in its fully
active form, with a lower likelihood of being converted
to SN-38G, which occurs primarily in the liver. It is also
important to emphasize that by coupling the linker to the
20-hydroxy position of SN-38, the SN-38 is maintained
in the active lactone form [32]. Collectively, these results
suggest that IMMU-132 is able to deliver and concentrate
SN-38 to Trop-2+ tumors in a selective manner compared
to SN-38 derived from non-targeted irinotecan, with the
SN-38 delivered by IMMU-132 likely being released
in the tumor in the fully active, non-glucuronidated,
lactone form.
Irinotecan is not conventionally used to treat breast
cancer patients. However, the experiments shown here
with TNBC cell lines indicate that concentrating higher
amounts of SN-38 into the tumor enhances its activity.
In both the MDA-MB-468 TNBC and HER2+ SK-BR-3
tumor lines, IMMU-132 mediated the activation of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway, with cleavage of pro-caspases
into their active fragments and PARP cleavage. The
demonstration of double-stranded DNA breaks of cancer
cells treated with IMMU-132 (compared to an irrelevant
SN-38 ADC) confirms the selective delivery of SN-38 into
the target cells. Most importantly, these laboratory findings
are corroborated by our translation of this ADC therapy to
patients with heavily-pretreated, metastatic TNBC, where
durable objective responses have been observed [25]. It
also appears that IMMU-132 is active in patients with
other cancers and who have failed a prior therapy regimen
containing a topoisomerase I inhibitor [24].
In conclusion, our results suggest that Trop-2 is a
clinically-relevant and novel target in many solid tumors,
particularly TNBC as well as lung cancers [25]. IMMU132 appears to be a novel, second-generation ADC by
using a moderately-toxic drug, SN-38, conjugated at a
high ratio of drug to an antibody via a moderately-stable
linker. This ADC appears to be more tolerable than when
the parental drug, irinotecan, is administered [24], and
thus challenges certain tenets of current ADC practice.

previously [2, 30]. Briefly, CL2A-SN-38, with the
attachment of the linker at the drug’s 20-hydroxy position
to avoid or minimize the lactone ring opening to the
inactive form, involved first forming the carbonate linkage
to the drug using an azido-PEG-lysyl-p-amidobenzyl
alcohol linker, followed by cycloaddition to a maleimideincorporated acetylene derivative to attach the antibodyconjugating group. In the CL2A linker, the incorporation
of a short polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety enabled
aqueous solubility of highly insoluble SN-38.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Trop-2 surface expression on various human
breast carcinoma cell lines

DAR determination by HIC
Clinical lots of IMMU-132 were analyzed by
hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using
a butyl-NPR HPLC column (Tosoh Bioscience, King
of Prussia, PA). IMMU-132 injections (100 μg) were
resolved with a 15-min linear gradient of 2.25–1.5 M NaCl
in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, run at 1 mL/min and
room temperature.

DAR determination by LC-MS
Because the interchain disulfides are reduced and the
resulting sulfhydryl groups are used for drug conjugation
(or blocked), the heavy and light chains resolved during
LC-MS analysis without addition of reducing agents, and
were analyzed independently. Different lots of IMMU-132
were injected on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC using an
Aeris Widepore C4 reverse-phase HPLC column (3.6 μM,
50 × 2.1 mm) and resolved by reverse phase HPLC with
a 14-min linear gradient of 30 – 80% acetonitrile in 0.1%
formic acid. Electrospray ionization time of flight (ESITOF) mass spectrometry was accomplished with an
in-line Agilent 6210 ESI-TOF mass spectrometer with
Vcap, fragmentor and skimmer set to 5000V, 300V and
80V, respectively. The entire RP-HPLC peak representing
all kappa or heavy chain species were used to generate
deconvoluted mass spectra.

Cell lines
All human cancer cell lines used in this study were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA), except where noted. Each cell line was
maintained according to the recommendations of ATCC
and routinely tested for mycoplasma using MycoAlert®
Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza; Rockland, ME) and
all were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) assay
by the ATCC.

for Trop-2 expression using QuantiBRITE PE beads
(BD Cat. No. 340495) and a PE-conjugated anti-Trop-2
antibody (eBiosciences, Cat. No. 12-6024) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were acquired on a
FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD) with CellQuest Pro
software, with analysis using Flowjo software (Tree Star;
Ashland OR).

washed three times with fresh media, and then returned
to 37°C overnight. Cells were trypsinized briefly, pelleted
by centrifugation, fixed in 4% formalin for 15 min, then
washed and permeabilized in 0.15% Triton-X100 in
PBS for another 15 min. After washing twice with 1%
bovine serum albumin-PBS, cells were incubated with
mouse anti-rH2AX-AF488 (EMD Millipore Corporation,
Temecula, CA) for 45 minutes at 4°C. The signal intensity
of rH2AX was measured by flow cytometry using a BD
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

IHC of Trop-2 in tumor microarrays
A TNBC microarray was purchased from US
Biomax (Rockville, MD; product BR487). Antigen
retrieval was done by incubating the slides in a Tris/EDTA
buffer (DaKo Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9.0; Dako,
Denmark), at 95°C in a NxGen Decloaking Chamber
(Biocare Medical; Concord, CA) for 30 minutes. Trop-2
was detected with a goat polyclonal anti-human Trop2 antibody at 10 μg/mL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) and stained with VECTASTAIN® ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories, Inc.; Burlingame, CA). Normal goat
antibody was used as the negative control (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN). Tissues were counterstained with
hematoxylin. A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded section
from a xenograft of the BxPC3 human pancreatic cancer
cell line served as a positive control. Scoring was based
on the intensity of the stain in > 10% of the tumor cells
within the specimen, including negative, 1+ (weak),
2+ (moderate), and 3+ (strong).

In vivo therapeutic studies in xenograft models
NCr female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, 4–8 weeks
old, were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown,
NY). Capan-1 xenografts were established by making
a tumor suspension from stock tumors and mixing with
cells harvested from tissue culture. A 0.3mL injection,
containing 20% w/v tumor suspension plus 1x107 cells,
was injected subcutaneously into the flank. NCI-N87 and
MDA-MB-468 tumors were established by harvesting
cells from tissue culture and making a final cell suspension
by mixing 1:1 with matrigel (BD Bioscience; San Jose,
CA) such that each mouse received a total of 1x107 cells
subcutaneously in the right flank. Tumor volume (TV) was
determined by measurements in two dimensions using
calipers, with volumes defined as: L × w2/2, where L is
the longest dimension of the tumor and w the shortest.
Mice were randomized into treatment groups and therapy
begun when tumor volumes were approximately 0.25 cm3.
Treatment regimens, dosages, and number of animals in
each experiment are described in the Results and in the
Figure Legends. The lyophilized IMMU-132 and control
ADC (hA20-CL2A-SN-38) were reconstituted and diluted
as required in sterile saline. SN-38 equivalents in a dose of
250 μg ADC to a 20-gram mouse (12.5 mg/kg) is equal to
0.2 mg SN-38/kg. For irinotecan (irinotecan-HCl injection;
AREVA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Elizabethtown, KY),
10 mg irinotecan/kg converts to 5.8 mg SN-38/kg based
on mass.
Mice were euthanized and deemed to have
succumbed to disease once tumors grew to greater than
1.0 cm3 in size. Statistical analysis of tumor growth
was based on area under the curve (AUC). Profiles of
individual tumor growth were obtained through linearcurve modeling. An f-test was employed to determine
equality of variance between groups prior to statistical
analysis of growth curves. A two-tailed t-test was used
to assess statistical significance between the various
treatment groups and controls, except for the saline
control, where a one-tailed t-test was used (significance at
P ≤ 0.05). Statistical comparisons of AUC were performed
only up to the time that the first animal within a group
was euthanized due to disease progression. Survival was
analyzed by log-rank test on survival curves generated for
each treatment (significance at P ≤ 0.05).

In vitro cytotoxicity testing
Sensitivity to SN-38 was determined using the 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium dye reduction assay (MTS
dye reduction assay; Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cells
were plated into 96-well clear, flat-bottomed plates as
described above. SN-38 dissolved in DMSO was diluted
with media to a final concentration of 0.004 to 250 nM.
Plates were incubated in humidified chamber for 96 h at
37°C/5% CO2, after which the MTS dye was added and
placed back into the incubator until untreated control cells
had an absorbance greater than 1.0. Growth inhibition was
measured as a percent of growth relative to untreated cells.
Dose-response curves were generated from the mean of
triplicate determinations, and IC50-values were calculated
using Prism GraphPad Software.

In vitro specificity testing by flow cytometry with
rH2AX-stained cells
For drug activity testing, HCC1806 and HCC1395
TNBC cell lines cells were seeded in 6-well plates at
5 × 105 cells/well and held at 37°C overnight. After cooling
the cells for 10 min on ice, the cells were incubated with
either IMMU-132 or hA20 anti-CD20-SN38 at ~20 μg/ml
(equal SN38 /well for both agents) for 30 minutes on ice,

details are provided by Sharkey et al. [54].
While spiking studies found the extraction
method was suitable for isolating SN-38 and SN-38G
(> 90% recovery), when IMMU-132 was extracted, the
full content of SN-38 contained in the sample was not
recovered, because the SN-38 bound to the hRS7 IgG
was precipitated with the other proteins. Therefore, an
acid-hydrolysis step was introduced prior to extraction,
where 150 μL of 6M HCl was added to 150 μL of the
samples, each containing the internal standard. The
sample was incubated at 50°C overnight, and then
neutralized with 111 μL 6 M NaOH, which was then
mixed with 300 μL of the extraction/protein-precipitation
reagent. The sample was then centrifuged and analyzed
by HPLC as described above. Qualification assessments
found that >  90% of the expected SN-38 bound to the
IgG was released and identified by this procedure. Thus,
the analysis of the non-hydrolyzed sample detected free
SN-38 in the samples taken from IMMU-132-treated
animals, while the acid-hydrolyzed samples detected the
IMMU-132-associated SN-38 in the sample along with the
free SN-38. Since studies found < 5% of the SN-38 in
the IMMU-132-containing samples was free SN-38, this
value essentially represents IMMU-132 SN-38. Samples
taken from animals given irinotecan were analyzed only
without acid-hydrolysis.
Quantitation of the drug products was based on
standard curves prepared from known concentrations of
each drug product of interest (i.e., SN-38, SN-38G, and
irinotecan) prepared in duplicate, ranging from 10 to
10, 000 ng/mL, and examining the log of the ratio of the
area under the curve (AUC) for the product of interest
divided by the AUC for the internal standard plotted against
the log of the product of interest (acceptance, correlation
coefficient > 99%). Samples of serum and tumor from
each animal were assayed at each of the times indicated,
with the average concentrations plotted over time. Based
on the dilution of the samples, the minimum sensitivity
of detection was 20 ng/mL for serum and 110 ng/mL in
tissue homogenates. AUC values were determined for the
specific interval where drug products were detected using
Prism (GraphPad software, version 6.0).

Cells (2 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates
overnight. The following day they were treated with
either SN-38 or IMMU-132 at an SN-38 concentration
equivalent of 0.4 μg/mL (1 μM) for 24 and 48 h. Parental
hRS7 was used as a control for the ADC. Cells were
lysed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors
(2 mM Na2PO4, 10 mM NaF). A total of 20 μg protein was
resolved in a 4–20% SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked by 5% non-fat
milk in 1× TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20)
for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were probed
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies followed by 1-h
incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2500)
at room temperature. Signal detection was done using a
chemiluminescence kit (Supersignal West Dura, Thermo
Scientific; Rockford, IL) with the membranes visualized
on a Kodak Image Station 40000R. Primary antibodies
p21Waf1/Cip1 (Cat. No. 2947), Caspase-3 (Cat. No. 9665),
Caspase-7 (Cat. No. 9492), Caspase-9 (Cat. No. 9502),
PARP (Cat. No. 9542), β-actin (Cat. No. 4967), and goat
anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Cat. No. 7074) were
obtained from Cell Signal Technology (Danvers, MA).

Quantification of SN-38 in mice with human
tumor xenografts
Groups of Capan-1-tumor bearing animals were
given a single intravenous injection of irinotecan (773 μg;
SN-38 equivalents = 448 μg) or IMMU-132 (1.0 mg;
SN-38 equivalents = 16 μg). Animals were euthanized at
5 min, 1, 2, 6, and 24 h for the irinotecan group, while
mice given IMMU-132 were analyzed at 1, 6, 24, 48, and
72 h (N = 3 per interval per group). In irinotecan-treated
animals, water homogenates of the tumor (1 part
tumor + 10 parts water) or serum diluted 1:1 in water
were extracted and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC
for irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G).
Each sample (150 μL diluted serum or tissue homogenate
that was not clarified by centrifugation prior to extraction)
was first spiked with an internal standard (9 μL of 3.33
μg/mL of 10-hydroxycamptothecin), and then mixed with
150 μL of an extraction/protein-precipitation reagent (1:1:1
methanol, ethylene glycol and 1 M ZnSO4 in DI water) as
described previously by Hirose et al. [53]. After vortexing,
the sample was centrifuged for 10 min (8500 rpm), and an
aliquot (5–20 μL) of the supernatant was analyzed using
an EMD Millipore Chromolith High Resolution RP-18e
100–4.6 column. The column was eluted at 1 mL/min
using a gradient (Buffer A: 50 mM KH2PO4 and 4 mM
sodium-1-decanesulfonate in DI water, pH 3.5 and Buffer
B: 60% Buffer A plus 40% acetonitrile) starting with 85:15
A/B running to 100% B over 15 min. The HPLC eluent
was monitored with a fluorescence detector, using 373 nm
