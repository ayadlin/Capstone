γ-Secretase Inhibitors Enhance Temozolomide Treatment
of Human Gliomas by Inhibiting Neurosphere
Repopulation and Xenograft Recurrence
Candace A. Gilbert1, Marie-Claire Daou1, Richard P. Moser2, and Alonzo H. Ross1

Abstract
Malignant gliomas are treated with a combination of surgery, radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ), but
these therapies ultimately fail due to tumor recurrence. In glioma cultures, TMZ treatment significantly decreases neurosphere formation; however, a small percentage of cells survive and repopulate the culture. A
promising target for glioma therapy is the Notch signaling pathway. Notch activity is upregulated in many
gliomas and can be suppressed using γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI). Using a neurosphere recovery assay and
xenograft experiments, we analyzed if the addition of GSIs with TMZ treatment could inhibit repopulation
and tumor recurrence. We show that TMZ + GSI treatment decreased neurosphere formation and inhibited
neurosphere recovery. This enhancement of TMZ treatment occurred through inhibition of the Notch pathway
and depended on the sequence of drug administration. In addition, ex vivo TMZ + GSI treatment of glioma
xenografts in immunocompromised mice extended tumor latency and survival, and in vivo TMZ + GSI treatment
blocked tumor progression in 50% of mice with preexisting tumors. These data show the importance of the
Notch pathway in chemoprotection and repopulation of TMZ-treated gliomas. The addition of GSIs to current
treatments is a promising approach to decrease brain tumor recurrence. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6870–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and
malignant form of brain tumor, making up 17% of all primary
brain tumors in the United States, with an incidence of
3.17 cases per 100,000 persons per year (1). The current
5- and 10-year survival rates for GBM patients are 4.5% and
2.7%, respectively (1). GBM clinical treatment consists of a
combination of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) is an
alkylating agent that readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier (2). TMZ is administered as both a concomitant and an
adjuvant treatment to radiotherapy. This aggressive treatment increases the 2-year survival rate for GBM patients
from 10.4% with radiotherapy alone to 26.5% (3). Cells that
escape radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced cell death
eventually reenter the cell cycle and contribute to local tumor
recurrence. Despite advances in chemotherapy regimens,
the median progression-free survival, which measures the

time until tumor recurrence, is 6.9 months and the median
overall survival is 14.6 months with TMZ and radiotherapy
(3). Hence, there is a dire need to target the cells that evade
current treatments.
Neurosphere cultures were originally developed for propagation of normal neural stem cells (4), and these methods are
now applied to tumors (5–7). Neurosphere cultures maintain
genetic profiles similar to the patients' tumors and form invasive intracranial xenografts in immunocompromised mice
(8–10). Our laboratory developed a neurosphere recovery assay
that measures neurosphere formation at three time points to
assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after chemotherapy (11). First, we assess the ability of the cells to form neurospheres shortly after treatment. Second, we count the
number of neurospheres that form during a 1-week recovery
period to determine if the surviving cells resume neurosphere
formation. Third, we dissociate the neurospheres and count the
number of secondary neurospheres that form to measure selfrenewal (12). This neurosphere recovery assay provides a quantitative assay for culture repopulation following drug treatment.
We previously showed that TMZ drastically diminished initial
neurosphere formation in many glioma cultures; however,
these cultures eventually recovered and formed a robust number of secondary neurospheres (11). The ability of TMZ-treated
neurospheres to recover and repopulate the culture suggests
that some cells undergo a transient cell cycle arrest, allowing
them to evade cell death and eventually resume proliferation.
Notch signaling is a promising pathway to target glioma
cells. The Notch receptors, their ligands, and downstream
targets, including members of the Hairy enhancer of split

Chemotherapy and Notch Inhibition in Gliomas

(Hes) and Hes-related protein (Hey) families, are commonly overexpressed in glioma tissue and cell lines (13–15). γ-Secretase inhibitors (GSI) are used to inhibit the Notch pathway in basic
research and clinical trials (16). In glioma cultures, GSI treatment
suppressed cell growth and decreased neurosphere formation
and tumor growth of CD133+ cells (17). Correspondingly, increased Notch signaling enhanced glioma cell survival (18).
GSIs were also shown to sensitize glioma neurosphere cultures
to radiation, thereby increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy (19).
In this study, we analyze if the combination of TMZ and
GSIs enhances glioma therapy by inhibiting tumor repopulation and recurrence. In contrast to TMZ-only treatment,
the TMZ + GSI treatment strongly inhibited neurosphere
recovery. This was confirmed by the loss of secondary
neurosphere formation in cultures treated with both TMZ
and GSIs. In subcutaneous xenografts, ex vivo and in vivo
TMZ + GSI treatment decreased tumor progression and increased survival. These data show the importance of the Notch
pathway for chemoprotection in malignant gliomas. The addition of GSIs to the current care regimens for GBM patients is a
promising new approach to decrease brain tumor recurrence.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Glioma cell lines converted to neurosphere cultures, U87NS
and U373NS, and primary GBM lines, GS7-2 and GS8-26, were
grown in serum-free defined medium consisting of DMEM/
F-12 1:1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), B27 (Life Technologies),
15 mmol/L HEPES (Life Technologies), 20 ng/mL epidermal
growth factor (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth
factor (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cultures were passaged using the pH dissociation
method (20). Details of the converted and primary lines
are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Drug treatment
TMZ and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)- L -alanyl]-5phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. N2-[(2S)-2-(3,5-Difluorophenyl)-2hydroxyethanoyl]-N1-[(7S)-5-methyl-6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5Hdibenzo[b,d]azepin-7-yl]-L-alaninamide (LY411,575; ref. 21)
was a gift from Lisa Minter and Barbara Osborne (University
of Massachusetts-Amherst, Amherst, MA). Details of drug
dosage are given in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere assays
For the neurosphere assay, cells were plated as previously
described (11). Immediately after plating, cells were treated
with DMSO, DAPT-only, LY411,575 (LY)-only TMZ-only, TMZ +
DAPT, or TMZ + LY. The initial neurospheres were counted
on day 7 for the converted cell lines and on day 10 for the
slower-growing primary lines. Neurosphere recovery was
measured on day 14 or day 20. The neurospheres were dissociated and replated and secondary neurosphere formation
was measured on day 21 or day 30. Details are described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

www.aacrjournals.org

For the samples labeled “pretreated,” a single dose of
DAPT was administered when the cells were plated, and
then TMZ was added to the medium 24 hours later. For
the “cotreated” samples, single doses of TMZ and DAPT were
added simultaneously when the cells were plated. Finally,
samples labeled “posttreated” were treated with TMZ, and
then DAPT was added 24 hours later.
Virus infections
NICD-pMIG (22) or pMIG vectors were cotransfected with
retrovirus envelope and gag-pol vectors into HEK293T cells
with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Retrovirus was collected after 48 hours. Neurosphere cultures were infected in
noncoated bacterial dishes to prevent the cells from becoming adherent in the presence of serum. Cells were incubated
with virus and 8 μg/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C
for 6 hours. GFP-positive cells were sorted on a FACSAria
(BD Biosciences).
Subcutaneous xenografts: ex vivo drug treatment
U87NS and U373NS neurospheres were dissociated and
2.5 × 104 cells/mL were plated in defined medium and treated with DMSO, TMZ-only (200 μmol/L), DAPT-only (1 or
5 μmol/L), or TMZ + DAPT as described for recovery assays.
After 7 days, 2.5 × 105 or 3 × 106 live cells were counted using
trypan blue and resuspended in 100 μL of PBS. Cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of nude mice. Mice were
monitored for tumor formation for up to 120 days postinjection
and euthanized when tumors reached volumes of 1.5 to 2 cm3.
Subcutaneous xenografts: in vivo drug treatment
For the in vivo experiments, we used LY incorporated into
7012 Teklad LM-485 rodent chow (LY chow) at a concentration of 0.0275 g/kg (Harlan Laboratories, Inc.; ref. 23). U87NS
cells (106) resuspended in 100 μL of PBS were subcutaneously
injected into the flanks of male nude mice. When the tumor
reached approximately 150 mm3 [volume = (3/4) (π) (length/2)
(width/2)2], we began the following treatments: (a) DMSO
control: 2 d of 100-μL DMSO/PBS (1:1) i.p. injections; (b)
TMZ-only: i.p. injections of TMZ (20 mg/kg) in 100 μL of
DMSO/PBS on days 1 and 2; (c) LY chow-only: 2 d of 100-μL
DMSO/PBS i.p. injections; the mice were fed LY chow from
days 3 to 12; (d) TMZ + LY chow: i.p. injections of TMZ (20 mg/kg)
in 100 μL of DMSO/PBS on days 1 and 2. The mice were fed LY
chow from days 3 to 12. Mice were observed for up to 150 days
and euthanized when the tumor reached 1.5 to 2 cm3.

Results
Glioma neurosphere cell lines express Notch receptors
and downstream targets
Converted cell lines (U87NS and U373NS) and primary
neurosphere cultures established from patients' GBMs
(GS7-2 and GS8-26) express the mRNAs for Notch1–Notch4
and the downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1 (Fig. 1A). Treatment
with DAPT downregulated the mRNA levels of Hes1 and Hey1
(Fig. 1B). The DAPT concentration used was determined
based on a 50% or greater knockdown of Notch targets. For

subsequent experiments, U87NS and GS7-2 cultures were
treated with 1 μmol/L DAPT, whereas U373NS and GS8-26
cultures were treated with 5 μmol/L DAPT.

Figure 1. The Notch pathway is active in neurosphere cultures and is
blocked with DAPT treatment. A, mRNA levels of the Notch receptors and
downstream targets were measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).
Notch1–Notch4, Hes1, and Hey1 were detected in each neurosphere
culture. β-Actin was used as a loading control. B, Hes1 and Hey1
expression were analyzed by RT-PCR 48 h after DAPT treatment. DAPT
treatment decreased Hes1 and Hey1 mRNA levels by 72% and 76%
in U87NS (1 μmol/L) and by 76% and 51% in U373NS (5 μmol/L),
respectively. C, the DAPT titration curve showed that treatment with low
concentrations (1–5 μmol/L) of DAPT-only resulted in minimal inhibition
of neurosphere formation in U87NS, U373NS, or GS7-2 cultures. Columns,
mean; bars, SD. DAPT administered at higher concentrations (10 μmol/L)
significantly decreased neurosphere formation. Neurospheres were counted
on day 7 for U87NS and U373NS and on day 10 for GS7-2. *, P < 0.001 (t test).

TMZ + DAPT treatment inhibits neurosphere recovery
and secondary neurosphere formation
When administered alone, low concentrations of DAPT
(1–5 μmol/L) decreased Notch pathway signaling (Fig. 1B),
but had little to no affect on the number of neurospheres
(Fig. 1C). In addition, low concentrations of DAPT did not
affect the size of the neurospheres (Fig. 2B). In U87NS,
U373NS, and GS7-2 cultures, treatment with 10 μmol/L
DAPT decreased neurosphere formation by 41%, 39%, and
49%, respectively, compared with DMSO controls (Fig. 1C);
however, the DAPT-treated cells resumed proliferation and
formed secondary neurospheres (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To determine if DAPT enhances TMZ therapy, we examined the effect of combined treatment on neurosphere recovery (Fig. 2A). After treatment with TMZ-only and TMZ +
DAPT, cultures had similar decreases in the number of initial
neurospheres formed (Fig. 3A–D). TMZ-only and TMZ +
DAPT treatments decreased initial neurosphere formation
by 80% to 98% and 83% to 99%, respectively. Cultures were
given an additional 7 or 10 days to recover in the absence of
drugs. During this recovery period, the neurospheres that
formed after TMZ-only treatment increased in size; however,
the TMZ + DAPT–treated neurospheres remained the same
in size (Fig. 2C). The number of neurospheres also increased
after recovery in the TMZ-only–treated cultures, but this recovery was not observed in the TMZ + DAPT–treated cultures. After recovery from the TMZ-only treatment, U87NS
showed a 2-fold increase and U373NS showed a 1.5-fold increase in the number of neurospheres (Fig. 3A and B). The
primary neurosphere cultures also showed a recovery from
the TMZ-only treatment: the number of GS7-2 neurospheres
increased by 1.8-fold, and GS8-26 by 1.6-fold (Fig. 3C and D).
In contrast, TMZ + DAPT effectively inhibited recovery for
U87NS, U373NS, GS7-2, and GS8-26 (Fig. 3A–D). The number
of neurospheres in these cultures was essentially the same
after recovery on day 14 or day 20 relative to the number
of initial neurospheres counted on day 7 or day 10.
To assess if the cultures retained cells capable of selfrenewal, the initial neurospheres were dissociated to single cells
and replated to measure secondary neurosphere formation.
TMZ-only–treated cultures readily formed secondary neurospheres, but secondary neurosphere formation for TMZ +
DAPT–treated cultures was significantly diminished. U87NS
secondary neurosphere formation in the TMZ-only–treated
culture was 36-fold greater (P < 0.0001) than the secondary neurosphere formation in the TMZ + DAPT–treated culture
(Fig. 3A), and U373NS secondary neurosphere formation in
the TMZ-only–treated culture was 23-fold greater (P < 0.001)
than that in the TMZ + DAPT–treated culture (Fig. 3B). The
primary cultures also had profuse secondary neurosphere formation after TMZ-only treatments, but minimal secondary
neurosphere formation after TMZ + DAPT treatments. Secondary neurosphere formation was 45-fold greater (P <
0.001) in the GS7-2 TMZ-only–treated culture (Fig. 3C) and

25-fold greater (P < 0.001) in the GS8-26 TMZ-only–treated
culture (Fig. 3D).
The number of cells in each neurosphere capable of
self-renewal can be calculated by dividing the number of
secondary neurospheres by the number of neurospheres
formed during the recovery period. After recovery from
TMZ-only treatment, there were an average of 8 and 3 cells
per neurosphere that maintained self-renewal properties in
the U87NS and U373NS cultures, respectively; however, in the
TMZ + DAPT–treated cultures, there was only approximately
0.5 cell per neurosphere that was capable of self-renewal after
the recovery period. In the primary lines treated with TMZonly, each neurosphere from the GS7-2 and GS8-26 cultures
contained a large number of cells capable of self-renewal, an
average of 38 and 31 cells, respectively. In contrast, the average
number of cells capable of self-renewal after TMZ + DAPT
treatment decreased to only 2 cells per neurosphere in the
GS7-2 and GS8-26 cultures.

To show that the lack of recovery and secondary neurosphere formation after TMZ + DAPT treatment was a specific
response to the inhibition of γ-secretase activity, we repeated
the neurosphere recovery assay with LY (21). When LY was
administered to U87NS and U373NS cultures at various concentrations, there was a dose-dependent decrease in neurosphere
formation (Supplementary Fig. S2A); however, the LY-only–
treated cultures retained the ability to form secondary neurospheres (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In contrast, the combination
of TMZ + LY significantly repressed recovery and secondary
neurosphere formation (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D).

U87NS and GS7-2 cells with a retrovirus to express the constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD; ref. 22).
Expression of functional NICD was confirmed by measuring
increased mRNA levels of the downstream targets Hes1 and
Hey1 (Fig. 4A). When NICD is constitutively expressed, the
Notch pathway is not inhibited by GSI treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). NICD-expressing U87NS and GS7-2 cells
treated with TMZ-only were capable of recovery and robust
secondary neurosphere formation, similar to the control cells
expressing the empty vector (pMIG; Fig. 4B and C). Importantly, NICD expression attenuated the effects of TMZ +
DAPT treatment, and the culture showed neurosphere recovery and robust secondary neurosphere formation. The control U87NS-pMIG TMZ-only–treated cells had a 1.9-fold
recovery, but no increase was seen in the TMZ + DAPT–
treated culture (Fig. 4B). U87NS-NICD cells showed a 2.3-fold
recovery in TMZ-only–treated cultures and a 1.8-fold recovery in TMZ + DAPT–treated cultures. GS7-2-pMIG TMZonly–treated cells showed a 2.1-fold increase in neurospheres
during recovery, whereas TMZ + DAPT–treated cells showed

no recovery (Fig. 4C). GS7-2-NICD cells showed a 2.6-fold
recovery after TMZ-only treatment and a 2.8-fold recovery
after TMZ + DAPT treatment.
Similar to the parental lines (Fig. 3A and C), U87NS-pMIG
and GS7-2-pMIG cultures treated with TMZ-only had robust
secondary neurosphere formation, but cultures treated
with TMZ + DAPT had minimal secondary neurosphere
formation (Fig. 4B and C). In contrast, U87NS-NICD and
GS7-2-NICD cultures had robust secondary neurosphere
formation for both TMZ-only and TMZ + DAPT treatments. When treated with TMZ + DAPT, U87NS-NICD secondary neurosphere formation was 61.2-fold greater (P <
0.0001) than U87NS-pMIG secondary neurosphere formation (Fig. 4B). In the GS7-2-NICD TMZ + DAPT–treated
cultures, secondary neurosphere formation was 47.8-fold
greater (P < 0.0001) than the secondary neurosphere formation in the GS7-2-pMIG TMZ + DAPT–treated cultures
(Fig. 4C). Hence, constitutive NICD expression eliminates
GSI enhancement of TMZ therapy, identifying the Notch
pathway as the relevant GSI target.

Figure 3. The neurosphere recovery assay shows that TMZ + DAPT treatment inhibits recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. Initial neurospheres
were counted on day 7 for U87NS (A) and U373NS (B) cultures, or on day 10 for GS7-2 (C) and GS8-26 (D) cultures. Columns, mean; bars, SD.

TMZ. Initial neurosphere formation was 7.2- and 2.7-fold
greater than neurosphere formation in TMZ-only–treated
U87NS and GS7-2 cultures, respectively (Fig. 5B and C). When
dissociated, the pretreated and cotreated samples formed a
large number of secondary neurospheres; however, posttreated samples had minimal secondary neurosphere formation (Fig. 5B and C). Secondary neurosphere formation was
significantly greater in TMZ-only, pretreated, and cotreated

greater (P < 0.001) with TMZ-only treatment, 8.1-fold greater
(P < 0.001) with DAPT pretreatment, and 4.8-fold greater
(P < 0.01) with cotreatment, relative to secondary neurosphere formation after DAPT posttreatment (Fig. 5B).
The inhibition of GS7-2 secondary neurosphere formation
was also greatest with posttreatment. Secondary neurosphere formation in the GS7-2 cultures was 85.7-fold greater
(P < 0.0001) with TMZ-only treatment, 98.5-fold greater
(P < 0.0001) with DAPT pretreatment, and 72.8-fold greater (P <
0.0001) with cotreatment, when compared with the DAPT
posttreatment (Fig. 5C). These results led to two observations. First, TMZ + DAPT treatment acts through a specific,
sequence-dependent mechanism. Second, these results provide insight for in vivo treatment schedules.

TMZ + DAPT ex vivo treatment greatly reduces
tumor initiation
We tested if neurosphere recovery correlated with the ability of cells to initiate tumors in a subcutaneous xenograft model. U87NS cells were treated in vitro with DMSO, DAPT-only,
TMZ-only, or TMZ + DAPT (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table
S1). Live cells (2.5 × 105) were s.c. injected into nude mice,
and tumor initiation was observed when a palpable tumor
formed. DMSO and DAPT-only ex vivo treated cells showed
similar tumor incidence (6 of 7 and 7 of 7, respectively) and
average latencies of 15 and 14 days, respectively. TMZ-only–
treated cells had an increased tumor latency of 32 days, but
the tumor incidence (6 of 7 mice) was similar to that of control xenografts. Impressively, none of the mice injected with

200 μmol/L TMZ + 1 μmol/L DAPT, and 7 d after treatment, mice were s.c. injected with 2.5 × 105 live cells. TMZ treatment increased latency, but xenografts
still formed. TMZ + DAPT inhibited xenograft formation. B, U373NS cells were treated ex vivo, and mice were s.c. injected with 3 × 106 live cells.
Treatment with 200 μmol/L TMZ increased latency, but tumors still formed. Treatment with 200 μmol/L TMZ + 5 μmol/L DAPT decreased xenograft
formation. C, in vivo TMZ treatment increased tumor latency in U87NS xenografts, but 100% of the mice succumbed to progression. TMZ + LY chow
treatment completely blocked progression in 50% of the mice. D, tumor volumes at the time of sacrifice. The U87NS TMZ + LY chow–treated xenografts
that lacked progression had no palpable tumor at 150 d posttreatment.

Chemotherapy and Notch Inhibition in Gliomas

TMZ + DAPT–treated cells (0 of 7 mice) formed tumors, even
after 90 days. When a higher number of live U87NS cells (3 ×
106) were injected, we saw a similar trend (Supplementary
Table S1). Mice with 3 × 10 6 cells of U87NS DMSO (2 of
2 mice) and DAPT-only (2 of 2 mice) xenografts developed
palpable tumors at 3 and 4 days, respectively, and 3 of 4 mice
with TMZ-only–treated cells formed tumors with an average
latency of 25 days. With this higher number of cells injected,
U87NS TMZ + DAPT xenografts formed tumors in only 1 of
4 mice with a longer latency of 43 days.
U373NS cultures were treated with DMSO, DAPT-only,
TMZ-only, or TMZ + DAPT, and 3 × 106 live cells were injected
s.c. into nude mice (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Table S1). The control DMSO cells formed palpable tumors in an average of 15
days for 7 of 7 xenografts, and DAPT-only–treated cells formed
tumors in an average of 16 days for 7 of 7 xenografts. Ex vivo
treatment with TMZ-only increased the latency of tumor
formation; however, the tumor incidence was similar to the
DMSO control xenografts. Palpable tumors formed for 6 of
7 TMZ-treated U373NS xenografts in an average of 43 days.
Ex vivo treatment with TMZ + DAPT greatly reduced tumor
formation in mice. Only 1 of 7 mice formed a tumor in the
TMZ + DAPT U373NS xenografts with an extended latency
of 96 days. The tumor-free mice were observed for up to 120 days
before sacrifice. These ex vivo experiments show the potency of
TMZ + DAPT combined treatment in reducing tumor formation.
TMZ + LY in vivo treatment inhibits tumor regrowth
We tested the effect of in vivo TMZ + GSI treatments on
preexisting subcutaneous glioma xenografts using LY chow
(23). A 10-day diet of LY chow significantly decreased the
mRNA levels of the Notch targets Hes1 and Hey1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Mice were s.c. injected with 106 U87NS cells
and treated when the tumors reached a volume of approximately 150 mm3. When the tumor volume was double the
original volume from the start of the drug treatments, we
judged the xenograft as progressing. The DMSO control
and LY chow-only cohorts did not have any delay in tumor
progression (Fig. 6C). TMZ treatment initially had decreased
tumor volumes (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, the
TMZ-only–treated tumors progressed in 8 of 8 xenografts,
and tumor volume doubled in an average of 23 ± 7 days after
treatment (Fig. 6C). These tumors had a normal growth rate
and were sacrificed between 23 and 39 days posttreatment.
Impressively, 4 of the 8 mice treated with TMZ + LY chow
displayed no tumor progression (Fig. 6C). In the other 4 of
the 8 mice treated with TMZ + LY chow, tumor progression
occurred in an average of 26 ± 3 days (Supplementary Fig. S5B),
and mice were euthanized between 24 and 33 days posttreatment. The TMZ + LY chow mice that did not have tumor
progression displayed a complete loss of a palpable tumor and
remained tumor-free until euthanized at 150 days (Fig. 6D). In
these mice, no tumor masses were evident by gross dissection
and examination of H&E-stained sections (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). Hence, the TMZ + LY chow treatment had a dramatic effect on preexisting tumors by curing 50% of the mice. During drug administration, toxicity was determined by weight
loss. TMZ-only and TMZ + LY chow cohorts initially showed

www.aacrjournals.org

a slight weight loss after TMZ injections (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). However, the TMZ-only and TMZ + LY chow mice
returned to their starting body weight, and no significant
weight difference was observed throughout the remainder of
the treatment. This shows that the mice tolerated the LY chow
alone and the combination of the TMZ + LY chow. The lack of
overall weight loss also suggests that the mice on LY chow
diets did not significantly reduce their food consumption
compared with control mice and received the estimated
average dose of 5 mg/kg/d of LY (23).

Discussion
With current GBM treatment, tumor recurrence is highly
probable. The neurosphere recovery assay of our laboratory
shows that the glioma cells that survive chemotherapy can
repopulate neurosphere cultures and form tumors (11). Neurosphere cultures are useful in vitro to study glioma response
to drug treatments because the neurospheres resemble the
phenotypes and genotypes of the patients' tumors (8, 10). In
addition, we found that the adherent glioma cell lines grown
as serum cultures are more sensitive to TMZ than the neurosphere cultures and do not recover (data not shown). In contrast, when neurospheres are treated with clinically relevant
concentrations of TMZ, a small number of cells survive,
recover from the chemotherapy, and repopulate the cultures.
The Notch pathway is active in gliomas and is inhibited
with GSI treatment. Low concentrations of GSIs alone
(1 and 5 μmol/L) did not have a significant effect on neurosphere formation (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with
those of Wang and colleagues (19), which showed that low
concentrations of DAPT or L685,458 only moderately reduced cell growth. However, a recent publication showed
that the potent GSI-18 inhibited neurosphere formation
and xenograft growth (25). In the presence of higher concentrations of DAPT and LY, a dose-dependent response was observed. At 10 μmol/L, the GSIs had a moderate effect on
initial neurosphere formation, but these cells retained their
ability to form secondary neurospheres. It seems that GSIonly treatment initially impedes the proliferation of neurosphere cells, but these cells are capable of recovery. On the
other hand, we showed that low concentrations of two GSIs,
DAPT and LY, enhanced TMZ treatment (Figs. 2 and 3; Supplementary Fig. S2). Neurosphere recovery was inhibited and
tumor formation was greatly reduced with TMZ + GSI treatment. Additionally, when the remaining neurospheres were
dissociated and replated, we found that the cells from
TMZ + GSI–treated cultures were no longer capable of selfrenewal based on their inability to form secondary neurospheres. The mechanism for the permanent suppression of
neurosphere formation with TMZ + GSI treatment is under
study in our laboratory. The specific population of cells that
are targeted by TMZ + GSI treatment is unknown. Research
in the growing cancer stem cell field shows that GBM stem
cells exhibit chemoresistance and radioresistance (26–28).
Because Notch activity is associated with GBM stem cell function and survival (13, 29), and the cells that survive TMZ-only
treatment are capable of self-renewal (Fig. 3) and tumor

initiation (Fig. 6), it is probable that the cells targeted by
TMZ + GSI treatment possess a cancer stem cell phenotype.
There is controversy about the current GBM stem cell
markers, such as CD133 (30), and further progress in this field
will be necessary to determine if the TMZ + GSI–responsive
cells and the cancer stem cells are the same population.
Inhibiting the repopulation of the neurosphere cultures is
dependent on the sequence of TMZ and GSI treatments (Fig. 5).
With single doses of DAPT, secondary neurosphere formation
was inhibited only when DAPT was administered after TMZ
(posttreated). Simultaneous treatment of TMZ and DAPT did
not significantly inhibit self-renewal. When DAPT was administered before TMZ (pretreated), secondary neurosphere formation was similar to that of the TMZ-only–treated cells.
Pretreatment also resulted in a higher number of initial neurospheres formed. These results were important in determining
in vivo treatment schedules for mice and will be valuable in
translating this research into the clinic. Because current treatments also include radiotherapy, we ultimately need to add radiation to our TMZ + GSI treatment schedule. Recently, it was
found that TMZ and radiation are additive when TMZ is administered before radiation (31). GSIs can also enhance radiationinduced cell death when administered within 24 hours before or
after radiotherapy (19). However, our results show that GSI
treatment before TMZ can diminish the efficacy of the chemotherapy, and to inhibit neurosphere and tumor formation, TMZ
should be administered before GSIs. Further experiments are
necessary to determine how irradiation will contribute to combination therapy with TMZ and GSIs and the sequence of
treatments that will provide the most efficient therapy.
Our mouse experiments show that the addition of GSIs to
TMZ treatment can significantly enhance the survival of
mice with glioma xenografts. Ex vivo treatment of U87NS
and U373NS cultures with TMZ + DAPT greatly decreased
tumorigenicity (Fig. 6A and B). The in vivo treatments
showed that TMZ-only treatment of preexisting tumors
was not a sufficient therapy because it only temporarily
blocked tumor progression. In 50% of the treated mice,
TMZ + LY chow treatment completely halted tumor progression and culminated in the loss of a palpable tumor (Fig. 6C
and D). In the other 50% of treated mice, there was substantial tumor volume at the time of sacrifice. This variability
may result from several sources. In the mice that have a
shorter latency, the TMZ concentration may not be high
enough to induce a cell cycle arrest in all of the cells capable
of recovery, which could hinder GSI enhancement (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). Also, a slight variability in the food
consumption between mice in the TMZ + LY chow cohort
could explain the heterogeneous response. These observations emphasize the need for personalized treatment with
regard to drug dosing. The response to the in vivo treatment

schedule was analogous to the response to the DAPT posttreatment schedule in the neurosphere recovery assay, which
showed that TMZ + GSI treatments permanently blocked
culture repopulation and tumor regrowth. These studies
suggest a role for TMZ + GSI therapy to reduce recurrences
in patients with low tumor burden after surgical resection of
the bulk tumor.
We believe that these studies have great potential for clinical translation because most or all GBMs have active Notch
signaling (refs. 13, 14, 18; Fig. 1A), and all the lines in this
study responded to the TMZ + GSI treatment (Figs. 3 and
6; Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, TMZ is already the
chemotherapy drug of choice for GBMs (3), and GSIs are in
clinical trials (16, 32–34). An additional benefit of the combined treatment with TMZ + GSI is that lower concentrations of the GSI can be used, and in culture, a single dose
of GSI is sufficient to enhance TMZ therapy. These may be
important clinical factors because GSIs can cause cytotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract (35); however, low GSI doses
and intermittent treatment schedules diminish these side effects (16). It is also possible that more specific inhibitors,
such as anti-Notch receptor antibodies (36), could be used
in conjunction with TMZ. In contrast to the reversible effects
of GSI-only or TMZ-only treatment, TMZ + GSI has an apparently permanent effect on neurosphere and tumor formation.
This response has the potential to enhance clinical TMZ
therapy by inhibiting glioma recurrence.
