Routine Perioperative Chemotherapy
Instillation With Initial Bladder
Tumor Resection
A Reconsideration of Economic Benefits
Pravin K. Rao, MD and J. Stephen Jones, MD

BACKGROUND: Level-1 evidence has demonstrated decreased recurrence of low-grade bladder tumors
when initial transurethral resection (TUR) is followed by perioperative instillation (PI) of chemotherapy. A
meta-analysis determined that the number needed to treat (NNT) was 8.5 patients to prevent 1 recurrence.
No benefit was demonstrated for tumors classified as T0, tumor in situ, or T2; thus, patients with those
tumors were excluded from the analysis, which potentially may have resulted in underestimating the true
NNT. Economic benefits were suggested, but cost calculations were not presented. The objectives of the
current analysis were to recalculate the NNT considering patients who previously were excluded and to
examine the economic implications based on various management alternatives for tumor recurrence.
METHODS: For each study that was included in the current meta-analysis, the number of patients excluded
because of ‘inappropriate’ pathology results was determined. A potentially more accurate NNT was calculated, and pertinent Medicare reimbursements were obtained to estimate costs. RESULTS: The added cost
for 8.5 patients who underwent inpatient TUR to receive PI was $1711. Inpatient TUR ($7025) was extremely
costly compared with hospital outpatient TUR ($2666), ambulatory surgery center TUR ($2113), and physician office fulguration ($1167). Although the inclusion of patients who previously were excluded resulted in
a recalculated NNT of 9.6 patients, the authors used a more conservative NNT if 8.5 patients to estimate
the economic impact of the ‘best-case scenario.’ CONCLUSIONS: Routine PI significantly lowered the overall cost if recurrences were managed in the inpatient setting, but these benefits were offset mostly or completely by outpatient management in the United States. Thus, the authors concluded that the decision to
use routine PI of chemotherapy should be based on clinical effects and not on presumed economic beneC 2009 American Cancer Society.

demonstrated a reduced recurrence rate of low-grade
tumors. It is hypothesized that PI prevents the implantation of suspended tumor cells at sites of mucosal irritation
after surgical manipulation.1-4
This concept has been received enthusiastically by
some clinicians, at least in part because it is 1 of the few
examples of clear Level-1 evidence in the urologic literature. According to a meta-analysis by Sylvester et al, PI
decreases the tumor recurrence rate by 11.7% overall,
from a rate of 48.4% after transurethral resection (TUR)
alone to 36.7% after the addition of a single postoperative
dose of intravesical chemotherapy.3 A decrease in recurrence was demonstrated for patients who had tumors classified (according to International Union Against Cancer
criteria5) as Ta and T1 with both single lesions (11.5%
decrease) and multiple lesions (17%), although the
authors concluded that this treatment was inadequate for
the latter tumors. A more recent meta-analysis of 2 studies
was performed by the American Urological Association
(AUA) Bladder Cancer Clinical Guideline Update Panel,
and the recurrence rate after PI of mitomycin C (MMC)
reportedly was 17% lower than that of TUR alone.6
Despite the overall decrease in recurrence, the
impact appears to be limited primarily to small, so-called
‘nuisance tumors.’7 A recent study indicated that the
tumors prevented by PI were limited to the smaller lowgrade tumors, and no impact was reported on the recurrence of tumors that measured >5 mm in greatest dimension.8 Finally, there is little or no evidence of a benefit
from intravesical chemotherapy immediately after TUR
for bladder tumors (TURBT) in patients with high-grade
disease,9 including carcinoma in situ (CIS), or for patients
with detrusor-invasive disease (T2).10,11 Possibly in
relation to these limitations, previous studies also failed to
demonstrate any impact on overall progression or survival, although the studies were powered inadequately for
those outcomes.3,6 Moreover, although the presence of
malignancy and pathologic stage/grade of tumors often
can be predicted based on cystoscopic examination, they
are not known definitively at the time of initial TURBT,
and a subset of tumors (approximately 7%) are high grade
although they appear to be papillary and low grade.12
Thus, the routine use of PI accrues costs and risks potential side effects both in patients with high-grade disease
and in those with benign pathologic findings, although
neither of these groups receives any proven benefit.
998

In the absence of a demonstrable impact on disease
progression or mortality, supporters of routine PI have
touted another theoretical benefit: that a decrease in recurrences inevitably leads to a decreased cost of repeat TUR
procedures. The meta-analysis calculation that a single recurrence would be prevented by every 8.5 PIs (the number
needed to treat [NNT]), it is suggested that routine treatment with PI after initial TURBT should be economically
beneficial.3 It is worth noting that this conclusion was
made based on the presumption that TUR costs probably
are >8.5 times the cost of a single PI dose3,12; however, to
our knowledge, no publication has considered the actual
costs involved. Moreover, the NNT calculations excluded
patients who received treatment despite having disease
that had demonstrated no benefit from the chemotherapy,
including patients with T0, T2, and T3 tumors, or highgrade disease, and some patients with multifocal disease.
In fact, up to 28% of the patients were excluded from the
larger studies, mostly because of these pathologic findings.8 Thus, the NNT in clinical practice probably would
be greater than the previously suggested number, which
appears to represent the ‘best-case scenario’ regarding the
benefits of PI.
Most recurrences are small and can be managed in
an outpatient setting. It has been reported that officebased fulguration is a viable alternative to operative
TURBT, and it is listed as an ‘option’ in the 2007 AUA
guidelines.6,13 Expectant management also may be appropriate for some small, low-grade, recurrent tumors.14 The
use of these options in lieu of hospital inpatient-based
intervention for recurrences probably would diminish further any calculated advantage of routine PI. Given all of
these issues, we sought to recalculate the NNT with consideration of patients who previously were excluded from
analysis and to evaluate the actual cost impact of routine
chemotherapeutic PI for all patients undergoing their first
TURBT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seven randomized clinical trials were included in the
meta-analysis of PI by Sylvester et al. We reviewed those
publications to recalculate the total number of patients
treated and the total decrease in recurrence from PI. From
these data, a revised NNT to prevent 1 recurrence was
determined.

* Includes 2 patients with G3 disease who were excluded from analysis.
y Forty-six patients had T0/Tis/T2/T3 disease or non-TCC within the bladder. Others were excluded for tumor ‘outside of bladder’ or ‘previous carcinoma.’
Only 129 PI treated patients of 397 total patients had follow-up information at publication in 1988; however, in 1996, it was indicated that 149 PI treated
patients out of 452 total patients were analyzed. The latter group was used in the meta-analysis by Sylvester et al and, thus, was used here.
z PI exclusions were calculated as follows: 46 total exclusions from the PI group times 66 of the 81 patients (81%) who were excluded for inappropriate initial
pathologic evaluation. PI G3 numbers were estimated as follows: the proportion of initial PI patients with G3 disease (24 of 205 patients) times the number of
PI patients who had follow-up and were used in the analysis (194 patients).
§ This study also had an interferon alpha PI group that demonstrated no benefit and, thus, was excluded from the PI group analysis.
kBecause of the loss of 2 patients to follow-up, these values were estimated in a manner similar to that used for estimating G3 patients for the Oosterlinck
study, as described above.

In 2 of the studies, the number of treated patients
who were excluded because of ‘inappropriate pathology’
was provided.10,15 In the studies that did not provide this
information,9,16-22 this number was estimated by multiplying the study’s total number of patients who were
excluded for tumors categorized as T0/tumor in situ (Tis)/
T2/T3 by the fraction of included patients in the PI group.
This method assumed a random distribution of patients
with these pathologic diagnoses among study groups.
In the United States, MMC is the most common PI
agent.6,23,24 With guidance from our reimbursement
team, we examined United States Medicare reimbursement for MMC drug costs and instillation charges and for
the management of recurrences by TUR (in hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and ambulatory surgery center
[ASC] settings) or fulguration (in the office setting).

because the decrease in the recurrence rate with PI was
11.7%. Thus, including all of the trials that were analyzed
in the meta-analysis, universal treatment of 728 total
patients saved 85 TURs, and the NNT was 8.5.
The exact calculation of the number of patients with
‘inappropriate histology’ (T0, Tis, and T2) was impossible because of limited data presented in the original publications included in the meta-analysis by Sylvester et al.
However, using the method described above, we estimated that at least 89 patients had been excluded with
inappropriate histology (for exclusions from each study,
see Table 1). Notably, the number of patients who were
treated with PI but then excluded from analysis, in fact,
was higher than the number of tumor recurrences that we
believed would be prevented.
Thus, in recalculating the NNT, we estimate that
728 patients (those included in the meta-analysis) þ 89
patients (those who received PI but were excluded because
of inappropriate histology, as described above) ¼ 817
patients who actually would be treated to prevent 85
recurrences. Consequently, 85 of 817  100 ¼ 10.4
patient recurrences are prevented for every 100 patients
treated, and the new NNT potentially is as high as our calculated 817 of 85 ¼ 9.6. Acknowledging that the

patients (Table 2). By using the less conservative NNT of
9.6, the added costs of PI to prevent 1 recurrence would
be as high as $1932, $2109, and $1832 in the same 3 settings, respectively.

Mitomycin C Costs

Economic Impact of Management
Alternatives

The cost of MMC has been cited as $130 for 40 mg.25
For our institution, the pharmacy cost for 40 mg MMC
averages $120. In the inpatient setting, Medicare does not
reimburse the drug cost of MMC when administered as
PI, so this cost (approximately $120) must be borne by
the facility. Adding the cost of instillation (Common Procedural Terminology code 51720) to the cost for the drug
(code J9291 in all outpatient settings and approximately
$120 in the inpatient setting), the total increases in cost
because of PI in the inpatient, hospital outpatient, and
ASC settings are $201, $220, and $192, respectively. The
breakdown of costs in each setting is shown in Table 2.
On the basis of the NNT of 8.5, routine PI would
be advantageous economically if the management of 1 recurrence cost more than the $1711 (hospital inpatient:
cost $201.27 per patient 8.5 patients) or $1867 (hospital outpatient) added cost of administering MMC to 8.5
1000

For the management of small recurrences with inpatient
TUR plus pathologic evaluation (the most costly option
presented herein), the estimated cost is $7025. In contrast,
the total (surgeon and facility) reimbursements with hospital outpatient TUR ($2666), ASC TUR ($2113), and
office fulguration ($1167) are significantly less burdensome (Table 2). Similarly, outpatient options for initial
TUR with or without PI cost just 30% (ASC) to 40%
(hospital outpatient) as much as inpatient TUR.
The cost to treat 8.5 patients to prevent 1 recurrence, thus, clearly is justified economically if the recurrence is to be treated on an inpatient basis. However, the
management of these small recurrences on an outpatient
basis offsets most of the cost savings of PI, and management with office-based fulguration is significantly less expensive than PI.

DISCUSSION
Level-1 evidence demonstrates that PI of chemotherapeutic agents decreases tumor recurrences in patients with
low-grade, Ta or T1 disease, although recent studies suggest that the impact is limited primarily to small tumors.
If recurrence is the only consideration, then PI appears to
be an obvious standard of care. Both the European Association of Urology and International Society of Urology
bladder cancer guidelines now support this treatment for
all patients undergoing initial TUR. However, the
recently revised AUA guidelines were more tempered;
they called PI an ‘option’ for patients with an abnormal
urothelial growth without a diagnosis of low-grade Ta
bladder cancer. This ‘option’ classification is described as
‘more flexible’ than the more evidence-based classifications of ‘standard’ or ‘recommendation,’ and these guidelines cite the cost, uncertainty of pathology, and side
effects as potential drawbacks of routine treatment. The
AUA guidelines list PI as a ‘recommendation’ for patients
with small-volume, low-grade, Ta bladder cancer; however, the histopathologic diagnosis of low-grade Ta bladder cancer seldom would be available at the time of initial
TUR. It is important to note that the guidelines do state
that PI ‘should be considered’ at initial resection when a
tumor appears to be papillary Ta.3,6,12
However, a single-issue focus on recurrence of what
justifiably can be called ‘nuisance tumors’7 overlooks important concepts. Delving deeper than recurrence rates
leads to a more complex decision; the side effects and the
impact on progression or survival are factors that have
received little attention, and a reduction of costs has been
stated, although calculations have not actually been published to date.
The same Level-1 evidence that proves a reduction
in recurrences of low-risk tumors also fails to demonstrate
a reduction in the more important outcome of progression or benefit of PI for patients with high-grade disease
(including CIS) or tumor stage classification other than
Ta and T1. In addition, a recent article by Cai et al suggests that PI does not improve the outcome for patients
with high-risk disease who subsequently receive bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatments.26 Because of limited
data and older grading systems used in previous publications, it was not possible in our analysis to eliminate
patients with high-grade disease to recalculate a more

accurate recurrence rate and NNT. However, in the studies that were included in the meta-analysis by Sylvester
et al, we estimated that 82 included patients (11%)
(Table 1) had grade disease and, thus, may have received
PI treatment with no clinical benefit.
Previous claims that routine PI is advantageous economically have been based on the assumption that all
patients with a recurrence undergo formal TUR, presumably in the hospital. However, most patients in the United
States who have a small tumor recurrence in the current
era do not require hospital admission with TURBT under
general anesthesia.12 Also, although a pathologic evaluation is mandatory for initial diagnosis, it frequently is
unnecessary for well documented recurrences of papillary
low-grade tumors. Nevertheless, we report data with and
without pathologic costs.
Herr and colleagues observed that office fulguration
alone was safe and effective in patients who had negative
urine cytology and <5 small, low-grade appearing, recurrent tumors.13 Furthermore, because of their indolence
and low mortality, it also has been suggested that some
recurrences of low-risk tumors may be managed expectantly.14 Although we did not include this concept in our
projections, it is clear that observation of patients with
recurrent tumors would negate the economic benefit of PI
in those selected patients.
Potential side effects and complications further
overshadow any economic benefit. Uncommon but severe
adverse effects that have been reported with perioperative
intravesical chemotherapy include extreme pain, paralytic
ileus, multiorgan failure, and death—each of which was
believed to be caused either by unrecognized perforation
or by drug-induced, nonhealing ulcers with secondary
perforation.24,27-29 In a study of patients who underwent
radical cystectomy after PI, 5 of the 6 patients’ cystectomy
specimens had extensive bladder wall perivesical tissue necrosis.30 Because of poor healing and changes of the bladder wall, patients who have high-grade T1 disease that
requires repeat TUR also may be at risk for perforation
and subsequent extravasation of malignant cells.24 Other
reported conditions associated with intravesical chemotherapy (with perioperative or multidose regimens)
include chemical cystitis, cutaneous desquamation,
decreased bladder capacity because of contractures, calcified eschars, and complications or added difficulty of subsequent cystectomy.24,25,30,31 It is believed that
1001

Original Article

calcification alone has little clinical significance, but it has
been associated with recurrent tumor.32
Complications of PI are reported infrequently, and
previous controlled trials have reported low complication
rates. In the meta-analysis by Sylvester et al, approximately 10% of patients had side effects or complications.3
There probably is some variability in data collection
methods and completeness, because individual studies
have reported rates ranging from 3.5% to 24%.10,15,18,20,21
Furthermore, it is well recognized that broad clinical
experience is associated with complications exceeding
those of initial randomized controlled trials. For each
of these complications, the objective costs of management certainly would render routine PI less economical, but this was beyond the scope of our current
calculations. It is noteworthy that, based on our analysis of the studies included in the meta-analysis, approximately 89 (excluded patients) þ 82 (included patients
with grade 3 disease) ¼ 171 patients—or 20.1% of 817
patients who received PI—were at risk for these known
side effects without receiving any therapeutic benefit.
The principal point of our study is that treating
recurrences in the outpatient setting offers an economic
management approach that obviates most, if not all, of
the purported cost benefit of PI. The costs of TURBT in
the ASC ($2113) and outpatient hospital ($2666) settings
are 30% and 38%, respectively, of the cost for inpatient
TURBT ($7025). Because inpatient TUR costs almost 3
times as much as outpatient TUR, the setting is likely to
have a much more significant economic impact than PI
itself.
Because PI appears to reduce only small ‘nuisance
tumors’ that are most amenable to outpatient care,8 the
average expected cost of management in the 3 outpatient
settings presented here would be approximately $1982,
which is only $115 (or 6%) greater than the $1867 cost of
administering PI. If pathologic evaluation for small recurrences were not performed, then this average would be
$1873—practically the same cost of administering routine PI. The cost of our standard management of a recurrence in the physician’s office ($1167) is far less than the
cost of PI necessary to prevent that recurrence (range,
$1711-$1867).
The primary limitation of our analysis was its dependence on 2 outside sources of data. The first source was
the landmark meta-analysis by Sylvester et al and its indi1002

vidual studies. Although studies of MMC have suggested a
greater benefit in decreased recurrence (17% vs 11.5% for
other agents), we included all 728 patients from the metaanalysis for our calculations, because the 2 MMC trials
included a total of only 206 patients who received PI—an
inadequate number to define the superiority of this agent.
Using only MMC clearly would have led to a lower NNT
and a more favorable economic analysis of PI; however,
comparative data on MMC versus other agents were not
available. In addition, the use of the cheaper (doxorubicin)
or more expensive (gemcitabine) chemotherapeutic agents
used abroad also would have altered the economic impact.
Finally, in our data collection, some variance in
numbers came from inevitable assumptions that had to be
made regarding the exclusions in each study. However, we
did demonstrate that the NNT actually was higher than
8.5. We believe that the previously presented NNT
assumed a scenario that put PI in its most favorable economic light.
We also had to calculate our cost projections using a
source of outside data—the US Medicare reimbursement
figures as supplied by our reimbursement team. We chose
them as the most reliable and frequently used cost data
available, although they apply to a limited patient population and can vary by Medicare carrier. We acknowledge
that the cost structure in other countries will differ substantially and was beyond the scope of this report.
A critical assumption of our model is that each
patient who develops recurrent disease patient will be
cured by the procedure chosen for treatment, a position
that underestimates the economic value of PI, because
patients who have recurring tumors may go on to receive
other treatments. A fully accurate cost analysis, thus,
would require a more detailed model of patients’ ultimate
courses, including surveillance cystoscopies, repeated tumor recurrences, and other subsequent treatments and
morbidities. In addition, the use of routine PI would be
favored by the costs of preoperative evaluation for TUR
and management of complications of TUR, which could
include bleeding, urinary retention/catheter placement, or
perforation. In addition, the cost of complications from
PI cannot be determined. Therefore, we chose to directly
address the economic claims made in previous publications for which we were able to obtain accurate data. Also,
it is possible that a decreased recurrence rate with PI could
lower costs if fewer surveillance cystoscopies were

performed or if BCG treatments were used less frequently,
but there are no data suggesting that this occurs on a widespread basis in the United States.
In conclusion, PI of chemotherapy after TUR
reduces the recurrence of low-risk tumors, but it presents
no demonstrable impact on progression or survival.
Moreover, with routine treatment, some patients with
high-grade cancer or benign findings on final pathology
receive PI with little or no demonstrable benefit. There is
a recognized low but real side-effect profile. Our current
findings fail to support a clear economic benefit to PI if
recurrences are treated in any outpatient setting in the
United States. All of these factors suggest that a mandate
for routine PI is not justified by the current literature. The
decision to treat a patient with perioperative chemotherapy instillation should be individualized based on medical
rather than economic considerations.
