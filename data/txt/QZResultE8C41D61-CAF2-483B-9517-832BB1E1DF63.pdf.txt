Abstract
Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) refers to aggressive malignancies which frequently harbor
characteristic EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG genomic fusions. Here, we report that these fusion products interact
with the DNA damage response protein and transcriptional coregulator PARP-1. ESFT cells, primary tumor
xenografts, and tumor metastases were all highly sensitive to PARP1 inhibition. Addition of a PARP1 inhibitor to
the second-line chemotherapeutic agent temozolamide resulted in complete responses of all treated tumors in an
EWS-FLI1–driven mouse xenograft model of ESFT. Mechanistic investigations revealed that DNA damage
induced by expression of EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG fusion genes was potentiated by PARP1 inhibition in ESFT cell
lines. Notably, EWS-FLI1 fusion genes acted in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of PARP1,
which was required for EWS-FLI–mediated transcription, thereby enforcing oncogene-dependent sensitivity
to PARP-1 inhibition. Together, our ﬁndings offer a strong preclinical rationale to target the EWS-FLI1:PARP1
intersection as a therapeutic strategy to improve the treatment of ESFTs. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1608–13. 2012

Introduction
The Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) refers to
malignant neoplasms of bone and soft tissue which frequently
harbor reciprocal chromosomal translocations that result in
the production of chimeric proteins containing the transcriptional activation domain from the Ewing's sarcoma breakpoint
region 1 gene (EWS) fused to the DNA-binding domain of an
E26 transformation-speciﬁc sequence (ETS) transcription factor (FLI1 or ERG; refs. 1, 2). Dysregulation of these chimeric
proteins have previously been implicated in abnormal proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis (3, 4). Although the EWSFLI or EWS-ERG fusion proteins represent potential disease–
speciﬁc molecular targets, transcription factors such as these
have been notoriously difﬁcult to inhibit therapeutically. How-

ever, given the poor outcomes of patients with metastatic EFST
(5), there is a clear need to improve therapy for these patients.
We have recently shown that an alternative strategy to
inhibit transcription factor activity is to target critical interacting enzymes (6). Similar to ESFTs, 50% of prostate cancers
harbor genomic rearrangements of ETS transcription factors
(7). However, unlike the EWS-FLI or EWS-ERG fusions which
produce a multifunctional chimeric protein, prostate cancer
rearrangements usually place an androgen-regulated promoter upstream of an ETS gene (ERG or ETV1), resulting in
increased ETS transcription factor activity by overexpression
(3). We have previously shown that PARP1 and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) are key ETS protein family
cofactors in prostate cancer, and therapeutic inhibition of
PARP1 disrupts the growth of ETS positive, but not ETS negative,
prostate cancer xenografts (6). Importantly, we showed that this
ETS protein interaction axis is mediated by the ETS DNAbinding domain (6). Although this interaction site is present in
the EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG chimeras, these fusion proteins
activate oncogenic pathways independent of their DNA-binding
domain (8). As such, despite the presence of the ETS DNAbinding domain, the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors against
these multifunctional gene fusion proteins is unclear.
Mechanistically, PARP1 is a functionally complex enzyme
that has been shown to both drive transcription and to
accelerate base excision repair (9–11). PARP1 inhibitors have
shown promising activity in early clinical trials (12), particularly in BRCA-mutant cancers defective in homologous repair
(HR), in which they may cause replication fork stalling and
subsequent synthetic lethal cell death (13, 14). We now

hypothesize that the EWS-FLI and EWS-ERG gene fusions in
ESFTs depend on the activity of PARP1 and may be targeted
with PARP1 inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and inhibitors
PC3, RD-ES, SAOS-2, A-204 (ATCC), CADO-ES1 (DSMZ),
COG10, and COG258 cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The
genetic identity of each cell line was conﬁrmed by genotyping
samples. Olaparib was purchased from Axon Biochem.
RNA interference
Gene-speciﬁc knockdown was accomplished with commercially available siRNA duplexes for EWS, ERG, FLI1, DNA-PKcs,
or PARP-1 (Dharmacon). Two independent siRNA sequences
were used for each gene for knockdown experiments.
In vitro assays
Soft agar colony formation, chemosensitivity, and basement
membrane matrix invasion assays were conducted per standard protocols (see SOM). Approaches for immunoﬂuorescence, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, COMET assays,
luciferase reporter assays, and Oncomine analysis are also
detailed in the SOM. Primer sequences available in Supplementary Table S1.
Xenografts
Severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice were purchased

implanted subcutaneously with RD-ES, PC3-luciferase-LACZ,
or PC3-luciferase-EWS-FLI (1  106 cells per injection). After 2
weeks, mice with tumors were treated with Olaparib and/or
Temozolamide. All procedures involving mice were approved
by the University of Michigan, The University Committee on
Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) and conform to their
relevant regulatory standards. Additional experimental details
are available in the SOM.

Results and Discussion
To test the hypothesis that EWS fusions interact with
PARP1, we carried out immunoprecipitation (IP)-immunoblot
analysis on cell lines naturally harboring the rearrangements.
Using an ERG or FLI1 antibody that recognizes the EWS-ERG
and EWS-FLI1 fusion proteins, respectively, we pulled down
both PARP1 and DNA-PKcs in a DNA-independent manner
from 2 cell lines, CADO-ES1 (EWS-ERG) or RD-ES (EWSFLI1; Fig. 1A). Reverse IP from RD-ES cells carried out using
a PARP1 antibody enriched for EWS-FLI1 and DNA-PKcs in a
DNA-independent manner (Fig. 1B), conﬁrming the interaction between EWS fusions and PARP1.
We then tested the sensitivity of ESFT cells to the PARP1
inhibitor Olaparib. To analyze the sensitivity of ESFT cells
overexpressing the EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG fusions, compared
with the prostate cancer harboring the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion,
we carried out soft agar colony formation assays on PC3 cells in
which we had stably overexpressed these fusion products.
Overexpression of any of these 3 ETS fusion genes caused
sensitivity to Olaparib (P < 0.05 at 3 and 10 mmol/L), and the

EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG fusions were more sensitive than the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (P < 0.05 at 1 mmol/L; Fig. 1C). Soft agar
assays conducted with CADO-ES1, RD-ES, or VCaP (TMPRSS2ERG rearranged prostate cancer) cells conﬁrmed that while
all ETS-positive cell lines were more susceptible to Olaparib
than the ETS-negative cell line PC3, ESFT cell lines were even
more sensitive than VCaP cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 1D). Importantly, Olaparib did not have an effect on an osteosarcoma
cell line, SAOS-2, or a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, A-204,
which were used as sarcoma model controls without ETS
rearrangement (Fig. 1D). We also found that 2 Ewing's cell
lines [COG10 and COG258 (both EWS-FLI1)] derived from
front-line chemotherapy patient relapses (and thus heavily
pretreated) were also extremely sensitive to PARP1 inhibition (Fig. 1D).
Given the sensitivity of ESFTs to PARP inhibition, we sought
to explore the mechanism underlying this sensitivity. In prostate cancer, TMPRSS2-ERG overexpression causes DNA damage, which is then potentiated by PARP inhibition (6). Surprisingly, Ewing's cells showed signiﬁcantly more gH2A.X foci (a
marker of DNA double-strand breaks) per cell than TMPRSS2ERG–positive VCaP cells (P < 0.05 for all EFST cells; Fig. 2A) and
1 mmol/L Olaparib caused massive induction of gH2A.X foci

(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Neutral COMET assays conﬁrmed
that natural EFST cells have more DNA double-strand breaks
per cell than VCaP cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). Importantly,
overexpression of EWS-FLI1 in PC3 cells led to increased DNA
breaks (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1B), and knockdown of
either EWS-FLI1 or EWS-ERG fusions caused a reduction in
COMET tail moment, and signiﬁcantly decreased the induction of DNA damage after Olaparib treatment (P < 0.05; Fig.
2B and Supplementary Figs. S2A, S2B, S3A, and S3B) suggesting that Olaparib-potentiated DNA damage is due to expression of the EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG fusion genes. Inhibition
of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) can synergistically
potentiate DNA damage in the context of deﬁcient HR.
However, siRNA knockdown of XRCC4 (needed for NHEJ)
had little effect (Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that
EFST cells have functional HR. Although PARP1 inhibition
dramatically accentuated DNA damage, it did not have an
effect on short-term cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S5A
and S5B).
We next assessed the effect of PARP1 inhibition on shortterm cell invasion. Intriguingly, siRNA against EWS, PARP1, or
DNA-PKcs reduced CADO-ES1 and RD-ES cell invasion (P <
0.05), while knockdown of key components of DNA repair

pathways (XRCC1 for base excision repair, XRCC3 for HR, and
XRCC4 for NHEJ) had no effect (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Figs. S2A and S2B), supporting a DNA repair–independent role
of the enzymes. Importantly, Olaparib disrupted ESFT cell
invasion (P < 0.05) at approximately 1 log-fold lower concentration than VCaP cell invasion (6) and did not affect ETS
negative, control sarcoma cell invasion (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2B).
Because PARP inhibition disrupts the long-term growth and
invasion of ESFT cells, we assessed the ability of EWS-FLI1 to
sensitize xenografts to Olaparib. Surprisingly, Olaparib significantly impeded PC3-EWS-FLI1 (P < 0.001), but not PC3-LACZ,

to Olaparib. Because PARP1 inhibitors are unlikely to be used
clinically as a monotherapy, we also combined PARP1 inhibition with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) to
treat a highly aggressive ESFT xenograft model (RD-ES) harboring an endogenous EWS-FLI1 rearrangement. TMZ potentiates the effects of PARP1 inhibitors (15) and is currently being
assessed in Ewing's sarcoma patients as second-line therapy
(16). Surprisingly, TMZ alone only delayed RD-ES xenograft
growth (P < 0.001; Fig. 3C). However, Olaparib also caused
signiﬁcant delay in RD-ES xenograft growth (P < 0.001), and,
when administered in combination with TMZ, led to an
immediate tumor regression and a highly signiﬁcant sustained
complete response. Mice were maintained without therapy
for an additional 30 days without any observable recurrence

(P < 0.001). Furthermore, we harvested lungs from RD-ES–
xenografted mice, assessed metastasis and found only 1 of 5
mice treated with Olaparib developed lung metastasis as
compared with 6 of 8 untreated mice (P ¼ 0.058; Fig. 3D).
This is the ﬁrst mouse model showing that PARP1 activity
is required for metastasis.
Given that PARP1 has roles in both DNA repair and transcriptional regulation (9, 10), we hypothesized that the sensitivity of ESFT xenograft growth and metastasis depends on
both PARP1-mediated roles. Consistent with this, knockdown
of PARP1 or DNA-PKcs, but not other DNA repair proteins,
disrupted transcriptional activity to a similar extent as fusion
targeting EWS siRNA as evidenced by disruption of consensus
EWS-FLI1 target genes (ref. 17; Fig. 4A and Supplementary Figs.
S2A, S2B).

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

In modulating EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG expression, we
observed that both EWS fusions maintain PARP1 mRNA
expression levels (P < 0.05; Supplementary Figs. S2A, S3A,
S6A, and S6B). This was unexpected because the ETS gene
fusions found in prostate cancer do not regulate PARP1 mRNA
expression (6), but consistent with reports showing that ETS
transcription factors drive PARP1 expression in ESFTs (18, 19).
Likewise, in EFST cells, knockdown of the EWS-FLI1 fusion led
to a decrease in PARP1 protein expression and promoter
activity (P < 0.05), while ERG siRNA did not have these effects
in VCaP cells (Fig. 4B). Conversely, EWS-FLI1 expression was
not altered by Olaparib in RD-ES cells (Supplementary Figs.
S6C and S6D). Finally, Oncomine tumor microarray compendium analysis showed that PARP1 mRNA expression correlates

PARP1 Targeted Therapy in Ewing's Sarcoma

Spearman correlation shown in ﬁgure), but did not correlate
with ERG expression in prostate cancer (Fig. 4C). Taken
together, our data suggest that PARP1 is critical to a positive-feedback loop in EFST, in which the EWS-FLI fusion
product drives expression of PARP1, which then further promotes transcriptional activation by EWS-FLI.
In conclusion, our data show that ESFT cells and xenografts
are sensitive to PARP1 inhibition, to a signiﬁcantly greater
degree than their ETS fusion-positive prostate cancer counterparts. This increased sensitivity may stem from both greater
potentiation of DNA damage by PARP1 inhibition, as well as
a EWS-FLI:PARP1–positive feedback loop in transcriptional
activation (Fig. 4D). Our ﬁndings suggest that PARP1 inhibition
should be explored as a strategy for targeted therapy in Ewing's
sarcoma, which may represent a tumor type that may be as
profoundly affected by PARP inhibitors as BRCA1/2 mutated
carcinomas (12–14).

Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest

The University of Michigan has ﬁled a patent linking ETS fusions in
Ewing’s sarcoma and prostate cancer as markers of sensitivity to PARP
inhibitors and DNA-PKcs inhibitors. A.M. Chinnaiyan and J.C. Brenner are
named as inventors. No potential conﬂicts of interest were disclosed by the
other authors.
