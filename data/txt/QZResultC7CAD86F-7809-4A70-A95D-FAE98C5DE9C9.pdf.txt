Reply to Antiviral Therapy and
Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis
We appreciate the interest of Testino et al in our recent
review.1 We agree that the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) remains elevated for patients who achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), particularly for those
who already have cirrhosis. This is a particular group of
patients who likely warrant continued regular screening for
HCC. Indeed, a subgroup analysis of trials enrolling only
hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with advanced fibrosis
and cirrhosis found a 3-foldâ€“increased risk of HCC in
patients who achieved SVR in comparison with trials
enrolling patients at all stages of fibrosis.2 As we discuss in
our review, a critical area of research will be identifying for
continued screening and treatment those patients who
attain SVR and continue to be at the highest risk for HCC.
We also agree that type 2 diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption are additional risk factors for HCC, particularly for those patients with preexisting cirrhosis.
Emerging data suggest that in addition to serving as independent risk factors for the development of HCC, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (a known result of type 2 diabetes
mellitus) and alcoholic steatohepatitis act to increase the
risk for HCC in HCV patients who have attained SVR.2,3
These findings support the developing model of multidisciplinary care for HCV patients, which will include hepatologists and other specialists who are able to assist in
managing comorbid factors, including alcohol use, obesity, and diabetes, to maximize their prognosis.

Minimal Clinically Important
Difference and Edmonton
Symptom Assessment Scale
The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale is one of the
most widely available and used patient-reported symptom
assessment tools in both clinical and research practice.
Given such extensive implementation, we welcome the
estimate of minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) provided by Hui et al for use in sample size calculations.1 The authors have used both patient-anchored
and statistical methods to estimate the MCID. This
should help to distinguish between minimal detectable difference and minimal clinically important difference.2,3
The calculated sensitivity and specificity of each
item of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale use the
patientâ€™s global impression as the patient anchor to create
a binary MCID.
There are limits to its applicability:
 A binary approach loses valuable information by ignoring ordinal variables. It is, therefore, difficult to see
whether the authors have identified an MCID (indicating a clinical threshold for decision making) or the minimal clinically detectable difference.
