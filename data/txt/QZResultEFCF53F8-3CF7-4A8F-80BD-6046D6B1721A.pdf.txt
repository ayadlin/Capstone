ABSTRACT
Although more than 90% systemic mastocytosis (SM) patients express gain
of function mutations in the KIT receptor, recent next generation sequencing has
revealed the presence of several additional genetic and epigenetic mutations in a
subset of these patients, which confer poor prognosis and inferior overall survival.
A clear understanding of how genetic and epigenetic mutations cooperate in
regulating the tremendous heterogeneity observed in these patients will be essential
for designing effective treatment strategies for this complex disease. In this review,
we describe the clinical heterogeneity observed in patients with mastocytosis, the
nature of relatively novel mutations identified in these patients, therapeutic strategies
to target molecules downstream from activating KIT receptor and finally we speculate
on potential novel strategies to interfere with the function of not only the oncogenic
KIT receptor but also epigenetic mutations seen in these patients.

(D816V) in the second catalytic domain, which results in
enhanced survival and cell autonomous growth of neoplastic
mast cells (MC). Neoplastic mast cells accumulate in different
organs, leading to a highly heterogeneous disease, which
affects both children and adults. Furthermore, approximately
10–15% oncogenic Kit mutations are also observed in corebinding factor leukemias (CBF-AML) [2–4]. Managing
clinical manifestations associated with KIT mutations in
mastocytosis has posed significant impediment in large part
due to resistance against currently described therapies. In this
review, we discuss the challenges and strategies to effectively
diagnose, treat, and manage mastocytosis associated with
oncogenic KIT and other newly identified mutations in genes
encoding epigenetic regulators and spliceosome machinery.

INTRODUCTION
Based on World Health Organization (WHO)
current classification, Myeloproliferative disorders, also
known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), are
grouped into the following seven diseases: (1) Chronic
Myelogeneous Leukemia (CML), (2) Chronic Neutrophilic
Leukemia (CNL), (3) Polycythemia Vera (PV), (4) Primary
Myelofibrosis (PM), (5) Essential Thrombocythemia
(ET), (6) Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia (CEL) and (7)
Mastocytosis [1]. These diseases present with a wide
range of symptoms. While some of these MPNs progress
slowly; others develop into aggressive diseases such as
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Although significant
progress has been made in treating some forms of MPNs;
Mastocytosis still poses significant challenges. Greater
than 90% patients with mastocytosis possess somatic
gain-of-function mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine
kinase, primarily an aspartic acid to valine substitution

tyrosine kinase that is expressed in hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells, germ cells, melanocytes, and interstitial
cells of Cajal [5]. The KIT receptor is encoded by a 21exon containing gene located on human chromosome 4q12,
which expresses a 976 amino acid protein with a molecular
weight of 145 kDa [6, 7]. The receptor is composed of an
extracellular domain (ECD), juxtamembrane domain (JMD),
and a tyrosine-kinase domain (TKD). The TKD contains a
phosphotransferase domain (PTD) and an ATP binding site.
The ligand for KIT receptor, Stem cell factor (SCF) or KIT
ligand, induces the development, proliferation, maturation,
survival and mediator release from MCs [8]. Under normal
physiological conditions, MCs are tightly regulated by the
availability of KIT ligand SCF, however under conditions
when a gain-of-function receptor is present; uncontrolled
proliferation, enhanced survival and cell autonomous
growth of MCs can contribute to the disease pathogenesis
[9]. The term mastocytosis is attributed to a group of rare
heterogeneous disorders that are characterized by abnormal
infiltration of neoplastic MCs into one or more organs
[10]. Based on its clinical presentation, mastocytosis can
be classified into two major forms, cutaneous (CM) and
systemic (SM) [1, 10–12]. Mastocytosis affects both children
and adults and is mostly acquired, although rare familial
cases have been reported [10, 13]. In children, the disease is
primarily restricted to the skin and mostly regresses during
adolescence. In contrast, in adults the disease can be chronic
and systemic in nature. In the pediatric population, the
disease predominantly appears in the form of various skin
lesions that reveals atypical MC infiltration and aggregates,
and is termed as CM. In adults, the disease is chronic and
systemic, invariably affecting the bone marrow (BM) and
is termed SM [14]. The adult SM patients may manifest the
indolent form of the disease or may present with a more
aggressive form or even progress to developing leukemic
variants of SM with abnormal accumulation of mast cells in
various tissues; primarily skin, bone marrow, and visceral
organs leading to multi-organ failure and shortened life span
[1, 15]. Most adult patients are diagnosed with the indolent
form of SM (ISM) where skin is the predominant organ
affected, while the aggressive forms of SM (ASM, MC
leukemia) are relatively rare in occurrence [10, 13, 16–18].
What is difficult to reconcile is the fact that how a single
mutation in the KIT receptor can potentially contribute
to such disease heterogeneity. In an effort to explain
these observations, recent studies have begun to focus on
identifying other non-KIT associated mutations that may
contribute to the disease heterogeneity in these patients.

non-mast cell disease (SM-AHNMD), aggressive SM
(ASM), mast cell leukemia (MCL), MC sarcoma (MCS)
and extracutaneous mastocytoma [1, 10, 12, 13, 19–23].
For some of these categories, particularly CM, ISM, SMAHNMD, ASM and MCL, subvariants have been identified
based on observed clinical and biological features (Table 1).
WHO guidelines define the diagnosis of SM based on either:
the fulfillment of one major criterion along with 1 minor
criterion; or fulfillment of at least 3 minor criteria [20, 23].
The major criterion involves multifocal infiltration of MCs
(MC burden) in BM or major other organs as determined
by tryptase staining. Minor criteria include: (1) presence of
atypical MCs in tissues, (2) presence of activating gain-offunction point mutation in KIT D816V in neoplastic MCs
in the peripheral blood, BM or visceral organs, (3) aberrant
expression of CD2 and/or CD25 in neoplastic MCs, and
(4) persistent elevated serum tryptase level (> 20 ng/ml).
In adults the presence of KIT D816V mutation is
found in > 80% of cases, while in children, KIT mutations are
found in > 75% of skin biopsies, however only 25% of these
are D816V mutations [24–27]. KIT mutations in children are
primarily localized to the extracellular domain (ECD) and
the most frequent mutation reported is a deletion at position
419. The question whether pediatric mastocytosis is a clonal
disease also continues to be debated [28, 29]. In general,
majority of pediatric patients lack the presence of D816V
mutation (only 25–36%) [24, 25], although a significant
number of these patients carry additional forms of activating
KIT mutations (D835Y, D816I, del417–418, D419Y, C443Y,
S476I, ITD502–503, K509I, D572A) [24, 25]. Overall 75%
of pediatric patients have some alternations in KIT, laying
support to the now prevailing hypothesis that childhood
mastocytosis is a clonal disease, although the spectrum of the
disease and mutations are narrower than those seen in adults
[24]. Importantly, in cases of pediatric familial mastocytosis,
no KIT D816V mutations have been reported, instead other
mutations (K509I, A533D, N822I, S849I, del419, del559–
560) and rare germline mutations are observed [30–32]
(Table 2). In addition to the spectrum of mutations described
above, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also
been found in KIT, such as (M541L, K546K, I798I, N828N
and L862L) [33]. Although the M541L sequence variation
seems to confer increased sensitivity to SCF, the clinical
significance of this SNP is still unclear.
The presence of activating mutations in adult patients
is mostly restricted to the PTD of the KIT receptor [34]. In
ISM patients, the presence of KIT D816V is virtually 100%,
when detected using sensitive assays on purified BM MCs
[35, 36]. A small percentage of ISM cases do progress to an
aggressive phenotype, which appears to be determined by
the presence of KIT D816V mutation in the non-mast cell
compartment acting as a predictor of aggressiveness of the
disease. ISM comprises of 2 subsets: well-differentiated SM
and SSM (smoldering SM) [11, 13, 23]. Well-differentiated
SM is characterized by either non-D816V KIT or absence
of KIT mutation. However, SSM is a special subvariant of

SM that presents with high mast cell burden, high serum
tryptase levels, organomegaly without organ failure but has a
clinical course that is stable over many years- hence the name
“smoldering”. Some of SSM patients eventually progress to
advanced forms of SM (ASM, SM-AHNMD, MCL), while
others remain in the smoldering stage. In SSM, the KIT
D816V mutation is usually found in the neoplastic MCs, as
well as in the non-MC lineage cells [13, 37].
While the prognosis of pediatric CM, ISM and
SSM is usually good, in ASM, the prognosis is relatively
poor with a median survival of only 41 months [38].
ASM presents itself with progressive evolution leading to
impaired BM function, hepatic and splenic failure, fractures
and severe weight loss. ASM patients present themselves
primarily with KIT D816V mutation in neoplastic MCs,
although other KIT mutations (D820G, V559I) have also
been reported [39, 40] (Table 2). While KIT mutations are
clearly involved in ASM and its progression to MCL, recent
studies demonstrate the presence of additional mutations
in these patients, which may help explain the aggressive
nature of ASM, progression to MCL and perhaps resistance
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [41–44].
SM-AHNMD occurs between 5–20% of all SM cases
and is considered a special subtype of advanced SM.
SM-AHNMD is the second most common form of SM
and usually occurs in combination with ‘associated clonal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hematological non-mast cell lineage disease’ (AHNMD)
[45–47]. Although SM-AHNMD is classified as a single
disease, it is now known that SM bears a mast cell, while
AHNMD bears a myeloid component in most cases (like
acute myeloid leukemia (SM-AML) or myeloproliferative
neoplasm unclassifiable, chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (SM-CMML), primary myelofibrosis (PMF),
atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassificable
(SM-MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (SM-MDS),
chronic eosinophilic leukemia (SM-CEL) or non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (SM-NHL) [2, 12, 19, 46], (Table 2). In a
clinical study comprising of 342 adult SM patients, 94%
presented with a KIT mutation (majority bearing D816V
mutation) out of which 40% of KIT D816V mutations
were present in the AHNMD component [15]. In a separate
study comprising of 48 patients with SM-AHNMD were
analyzed for the presence of KIT mutations in the SM and
AHNMD components of the disease; majority of KIT
D816V mutations were found in the AHNMD component
(89% in SM-CMML and 30% in SM-AML). Interestingly,
in these studies, no patients with lymphoproliferative
AHNMD displayed KIT mutations [46]. Overall, the KIT
D816V mutation has been detected in the SM component of
all patients, with the exception of CEL, and the frequency
of KIT mutations in patients bearing AHNMD component

recommendations of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis, Leukemia 2015, 1–10
is significantly higher than in patients with pure-SM [46].
Presence of KIT D816V mutation in the disease component
of SM-AHNMD suggests a clonal relationship between
the two components of the disease (SM and AHNMD),
with both appearing to have a common precursor (MC/
monocytic). One prevailing hypothesis is that KIT D816V
is likely to be an early genetic hit in a ‘stem cell’ that gives
rise to mast cells (the SM component) and cells of myeloid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lineage (the AHNMD component), which likely is followed
by a second hit in the AHNMD component, resulting in
the development of a more aggressive form of the disease
including SM-CMML, SM-MDS and SM-AML [2].
In MCL, the frequency of KIT D816V mutation
is less frequent compared to ISM, with only 46% MCL
patients expressing this mutation [48]. Interestingly,
mutations in the ECD of KIT, juxtamembrane domain
18253

Oncotarget

(JMD) or complete lack of mutations in the KIT receptor
have also been reported in patients with MCL. Thus,
although the overall frequency of MCL is rare, the overall
prognosis of this disease is dismal. The last subvariant of
mastocytosis is called MCS, which is an extremely rare
aggressive neoplasm presenting itself as a solitary mass.
Till date no KIT D816V mutation has been reported
in patients with MCS, although other non-codon KIT
mutations have been found (N822K, del419) [49] (Table 2).
Taken together, the KIT D816V gain-of-function mutation
is detected in almost all subtypes of mastocytosis,
resulting in uncontrolled activation of the KIT receptor in
the appropriate cell type of the BM. However as discussed
earlier, the tremendous heterogeneity associated with
various forms of mastocytosis cannot be reconciled only
by the presence of KIT mutations, letting credence to the
possible presence of additional genetic abnormalities in
these patients. Below we discuss such possibilities.

SM, ISM [53]. Interestingly, the SM-AHNMD sub-group
co-expressed a combination of more than one genetic
and/or epigenetic mutation (e.g. KIT D816V / TET2 /
DNMT3A or TET2 / DNMT3A or TET2 / ASLXL1). Poor
overall survival (OS) was observed in patients bearing
TET2 mutations alone, and also in those patients in which
more than one mutation was identified including TET2,
DNMT3A and/or ASXL1, independent of the oncogenic
KIT status. In yet another study involving 74 SM patients,
82.5% patients presented with KIT mutations out of which
78.4% showed the presence of KIT D816V mutation [55].
TET2 deletion was detected in 20.3% of these patients,
and all TET2 mutations co-occurred with KIT D816V
mutation, indicating that deregulation of epigenetic genes
such as TET2 could promote the development of severe
forms of SM in conjunction with KIT D816V mutations.
A more recent study [56] highlighted the presence of
additional mutations in a cohort of 62 patients with SMAHNMD including the presence of KIT mutations (87%),
TET2 mutations (27%), ASXL1 mutations (14%) and CBL
mutations (11%). Similar to previously reported clinical
findings [42, 53], presence of the KIT D816V mutation
significantly correlated with the presence of TET2
mutations, but not with ASXL1 mutations. Although the
percentage of TET2 mutations (27%) reported in these
studies was higher than ASXL1 mutations (14%), only the
presence of ASXL1 mutation remained an independent
prognostic factor that negatively affected the OS of SMAHNMD patients [56]. Taken together, these studies
suggest that cooperation between KIT and TET2 mutations
is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of mastocytosis;
the possibility that ASXL1 also plays a role in this process
cannot be ruled out. The extent to which these mutations
function together can only be tested experimentally.
In this regard, De Vita et al. [57] used a mouse model
harboring TET2 deletion with concomitant KIT D814V
expression, and demonstrated that KIT D814V and TET2
deletion (KIT D814V, TET2-/-) cooperates in the mast cell
compartment; resulting in a more aggressive phenotype
as assessed by the presence of lesions in skin and the
digestive tract [57]. More recently, Schwaab et al. [43]
utilized next generation sequencing to investigate the
presence of additional mutations in 39 SM patients. In
addition to the presence of KIT D816V mutation in all
patients tested, five additional genes were found to be
most frequently mutated including TET2 (39%), SRSF2
(36%), ASXL1 (20%), RUNX1 (23%) and CBL (20%).
Importantly 10 out of 39 patients carried more than one
TET2 mutation (two patients had four TET2 mutations),
while one patient carried a double mutation in RUNX1,
and two patients harbored a triple mutation in CBL.
In addition to TET2, ASXL1 appears to also be
frequently mutated in patients with mastocytosis (12%20% cases) [43, 53, 56]. Traina and colleagues first reported
ASXL1 as the only other genetic lesion that was detected in
a patient with ISM besides KIT D816V, and also in patients

Clonal evolution: additional mutations in
conjunction with mutated KIT
Although KIT D816V mutations are present in all
subtypes of mastocytosis, the presence of the KIT mutation
does not always correlate with a specific sub-type of SM
or its prognosis. Moreover, the KIT D816V mutation is
resistant to targeted therapies such as Imatinib (Gleevec),
and treatment with newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
like Nilotinib and Dasatinib have shown limited success
as many patients relapse after entering remission [50, 51].
Although clinical trials with Midostaurin (PKC412) [41,
52] has yielded promising results, the existing discrepancy
of TKIs toward KIT D816V mutations in vitro (effective)
and in vivo (not effective) suggests the possibility of yet
unknown additional co-operating mutations that may
contribute to the development and pathogenesis of various
subtypes of mastocytosis and influence the response to
TKI therapy [42, 53, 54]. One such molecular aberration
was detected in the tumor suppressor gene TET2. In a
clinical study involving 48 SM patients, presence of TET2
mutation was detected in approximately 29% cases [42].
Specifically, TET2 mutations were identified in 15% of the
ISM cases, 40% ASM and 35% of SM-AHNMD patients.
Further, 50% of these patients demonstrated the presence
of both KIT D816V and TET2 mutations, suggesting that
the high frequency of cooperating (TET2 – KIT D816V)
mutations may contribute to the heterogeneity observed
in SM patients. In a separate study, prevalence of TET2
mutations in mastocytosis patients was observed in 23%
patients out of a total number of 26 (15 ISM, 8 SMAHNMD, 2 ASM, 1 MCS) [53]. Importantly, this same
study revealed the presence of DNMT3A, ASXL1 and
CBL mutations in 12%, 12% and 4%, respectively [53].
Similar to the previous study [42], in this study, 62% of
TET2 mutations were reported in SM-AHNMD sub-group,
while only 7% were detected in non-aggressive form of

with SM-AHNMD. Study by Schwaab et al. concluded that
the OS of patients with ASXL1 mutation was significantly
shorter than patients harboring the KIT D816V mutation
alone. Likewise, Damaj et al. showed that the presence
of ASXL1 mutation is an independent prognostic factor
that significantly correlates with negative OS. Overall,
these clinical findings suggest that the presence of ASXL1
mutations, besides KIT and TET2 may also contribute to
the prognosis and survival of mastocytosis patients. How
precisely these mutations contribute to disease pathogenesis
remains an active area of investigation.
In addition to the above described mutations,
mastocytosis patients also possess mutations in the
Spliceosome machinery. Spliceosomes ensure the correct
linear order of exons spliced in mRNAs, and mutations in
these genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) are frequently
detected in patients with MDS and CMML [58]. Hanseens
et al. [59]reported 23.6% SRSF2, 5.6% SF3B1 and 2.7%
U2AF1 mutations in a group of 72 mastocytosis patients
and their presence was mutually exclusive. The frequency
of SRSF2 (23.6%) mutations in patients with mastocytosis
appeared to be greater than TET2 mutations, at least in
these studies [59]. Importantly, the SRSF2 mutation was
exclusively present in the AHNMD component of all SMAHNMD patients examined and was specifically identified
in the neoplastic MCs and monocytes (i.e. both in SM &
AHNMD components). A statistical correlation between
the presence of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations in this cohort of
patients was also observed; however the presence of SRSF2
mutation did not impact the OS of these patients, unlike that
seen in patients with TET2 mutations. A few studies reported a
slightly lower rate of mutations in genes such as CBL (3.8%20.5%), DNMT3A (12%), KRAS, NRAS, JAK2, EZH2 (5.1%)
and ETV6. CBL mutations were mostly found in patients with
SM-AHNMD, while DNMT3A and EZH2 mutations were
primarily seen in SM patients [43, 53, 54, 56, 59].
With respect to RAS mutations (NRAS, KRAS,
HRAS) in SM; NRAS mutation (V12) results in the
manifestation of an ASM, MCL and/or SM like disease
phenotype in mice. Consistently, Wilson and colleagues
reported the presence of NRAS mutations in 4.5% SM
patients in a cohort of 44 patients also bearing the KIT
D816V mutation. Interestingly, 2 of these patients
demonstrated the presence of NRAS mutation but lacked
the KIT D816V lesion. Whether NRAS mutation precedes
KIT mutation in the clonal development of mastocytosis
remains to be determined [54].
While several clinical studies have shown the cooccurence of genetic and epigenetic mutations in different
forms of mastocytosis, a recent study showed that patients
with advanced SM could carry as many as 3 (78% of the
cases) and in some cases more than 5 mutations (41% of
the cases) [43]. The combination of these mutations in these
patients varied from the presence of a combination of KITTET2-SRSF2 (26% cases) or KIT-SRSF2-RUNX1 (18%
cases) or KIT-TET2-CBL (13% cases) or KIT-SRSF2-ASXL1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(10% cases) or KIT-TETS2-ASXL1 (10% cases). A clinical
follow-up was performed on 38 of 39 patients in this
study [43]. All 6 patients who died had advanced SM
(advSM), but more importantly 5 patients had more than
3 mutations, while 2 patients had more than 5 mutations
(besides KIT D816V). These findings highlight the fact
that the severity, prognosis and overall survival of patients
with advSM might be related to the pattern of mutations
that are acquired during the course of the disease. It will
be of prime importance to pursue future studies directed at
analyzing which group of concurrent mutations (e.g. KITTET2-ASXL1), and their sequential onset in the course of
disease evolution (e.g. KIT followed by TET2 followed
by ASXL1) plays a role in establishing the severity of
mastocytosis and survival of patients. Gerbaulet et al. [60]
described a mouse model where expression of KIT D814V
mutation in immature hematopoietic cells (stem cells) and
mature mast cells gives rise to key pathological features of
mastocytosis observed in human patients. This model can
be utilized to analyze the role of lesions in respective genes
like KIT, TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1 and CBL in the mast
cell compartment, and analyze their relative contribution
to the development of advSM. As currently recommended
by the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis
(ECNM), robust and sensitive methods like ASO-qPCR,
RFLP, Nested RT-PCR, NGS should be incorporated to
detect various KIT and associated mutations in neoplastic
MCs [33]. It will be interesting to see whether the frequency
of some of these mutations increases than current reported
levels once these diagnostic methods are employed, and/
or yet unidentified new mutations are observed in patients
with mastocytosis. A summary of mutations described in
this section is depicted in Table 3.

Alternate therapeutic strategy: targeting
downstream signaling pathways from the
mutated KIT receptor
The mechanism of constitutive activation of the KIT
receptor bearing the D816V mutation is at best speculative
at present, given that the crystal structure of the kinase
domain of KIT has not been identified. It is believed that
the D816V mutation results in conformational changes
in the phosphotransferase domain (PD) of KIT receptor
relieving its auto inhibited state leading to sustained ligand
independent activation of the KIT receptor [34]. Several
studies have compared the downstream signaling pathways
activated via the oncogenic KIT D816V versus the WT
KIT receptor and have observed both qualitative as well as
quantitative differences in their signaling potential. These
observations provide rationale to target different signaling
molecules that are hijacked by the mutated KIT D816V
receptor in neoplastic MCs, thus providing alternative
treatment strategies to treat mastocytosis, besides utilizing
the currently available options involving TKIs, which
show poor responses in clinical trials.

N.D. signifies “Not Determined”. NOTE: Mutations represented above includes total (%) of those present alone (ex. KIT
D816V), and with other mutations (ex. KIT D816V + TET2).
The subcellular localization of the mutated KIT
receptor can trigger unique signals in a cell. To this end,
the mutated KIT receptor induces oncogenic signals
from the Golgi, and not when localized to the ER, where
sustained activation of STAT5 but not of ERK1/2 pathway
is observed. Similarly, cell surface localized KIT D816V
receptor triggers sustained activation of c-CBL and SHC
pathways, however activation of AKT and ERK1/2 requires
the availability of SCF (in spite of D816V mutation). Thus,
KIT can trigger differential signals based on its subcellular
localization and/or its substrate specificity [61–63]. Here,
we discuss various signaling pathways that play a role in the
transformation of neoplastic MCs (Figure 1). Gleixner and
colleagues reported the activation of SRC family kinases
(SFKs), LYN and BTK in neoplastic MCs independent of
the presence of KIT D816V mutation [64]. Importantly,
Dasatinib and Bosutinib deactivated LYN/BTK and
rescued neoplastic growth in MCs and a synergistic dose
dependent effect on growth repression was observed when
Dasatinib was combined with Midostaurin, highlighting
the potential of developing new combination therapies
to treat mastocytosis. Recently, the mTORC complex
components (mTORC 1 & 2) have been attributed in KIT
D816V induced neoplastic growth. mTORC1 contributes
to MC survival, while mTORC2 plays a critical balance
between neoplastic and dividing immature MCs leading
to the conclusion that perhaps targeting mTORC2 would
reduce the neoplastic MC burden, while leaving the
normal MCs unaffected [65]. Upstream from mTORC,
AKT also contributes to KIT D816V dependent growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of neoplastic MCs. Active AKT is readily detected in
neoplastic MCs obtained from mastocytosis patients, and
in human mastocytosis patient derived cell line HMC1.2
active AKT regulates downstream targets like FOXO, NFkB, and CREB, resulting in anti-apoptotic and sustained
cell survival signals that can contribute to malignant
growth of neoplastic MCs [32, 66, 67]. Amongst various
AKT inhibitors, GSK2141795 has shown some promise in
clinical trials [68].
The role of PI3K in various other cancers, besides
mastocytosis, is well documented and several agents
targeting PI3K are in clinical trials [69]. Similarly, the
role of BTK in various other malignancies like Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma
(MCL) and Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia (WM)
is well established and clinical trials using Ibrutinib
[70] has shown favorable outcomes. Given the relative
success of PI3K [69] and BTK [70] inhibitors in treating
other malignancies, it remains to be seen whether they
demonstrate similar efficacy in mastocytosis patients.
In addition to a direct role for the PI3Kinase/
AKT pathway, STAT5 is also involved in the growth
of neoplastic MCs. Knockdown of STAT5 inhibits the
growth of neoplastic MCs. In neoplastic MCs, activated
form of STAT5 (pSTAT5) is present in both the nuclear
and cytosolic compartments. The presence of pSTAT5 in
the cytosol of neoplastic MCs is due to STAT5 association/
docking with p85 subunit of PI3K via the GAB2 protein.
This type of retention of pSTAT5 in the cytosol is
attributed to the regulation of AKT signaling pathway

Figure 1: Targeting various downstream signaling pathways from mutated KIT D816V receptors are depicted. PI3K

mediated activation of RAS-MAPK-JNK pathway, AKT-ERK and ATK-mTORC2 pathway leads to survival of neoplastic MCs. Recent
studies highlight newer pathways mediated by SHP2, FAK, ROCK are described with corresponding inhibitors that hold promise. (1) SHP2
and P13K/GAB2 induced AKT/ERK activation can be inhibited using SHP2 specific inhibitor IIBO8, (2) FAK/TIAM1/RAC1/PAK1

malignancies [69], (7) targeting AKT (GSK2141795), (8) inhibiting JAK with Roxolitinib, Lestaurtinib , Pacritinib, and (9) targeting
epigenetic regulators ASXL1, DNMT3A and TET2 by 5-azacytidine (5′-AZA) and 5-aza-2′ deoxycytidine (Decitabine/DAC).

in neoplastic MCs. Thus STAT5 function in neoplastic
MCs is linked to the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.
Although these studies [66, 71, 72] indicate STAT5 as
a bonafide target for treating mastocytosis, designing
STAT5 inhibitors that can be used to treat different
forms of mastocytosis still remains a challenge and an
actively studied area of research. Chaix and colleagues
[73] reported a role of JAK in phosphorylation of STAT
proteins downstream of KIT D816V mutant bearing cells,
and mutations in JAKs (5.1%–13%) [43, 56] have been
identified in mastocytosis patients. Together these data
indicate that JAKs can also be potential targets to treat
mastocytosis. On the other hand, JAK mutations have also
been found in CML, and a first generation JAK inhibitor
Roxolitinib has been approved to treat myelofibrosis.
Second generation JAK inhibitors like Lestaurtinib (CEP701), and Pacritinib (SB1518) have shown promising
results in clinical trials [74]. It remains to be seen whether
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

these inhibitors can also be used for treating patients with
mastocytosis.
SHP2 phosphatase is hyperactive and overexpressed
in cells bearing the KIT D816V mutation [75]. Using a
salicyclic acid based inhibitor II-BO8, which has enhanced
selectivity and affinity for SHP2, its activity downstream
of KIT D816V can be inhibited, which results in the
repression of constitutive growth and survival of these
cells. In these cells, constitutively active SHP2 recruits
PI3K and GAB2 that leads to the activation of AKT/ERK
pathways resulting in KIT D814V mediated transformation.
More importantly, treatment of mice transplanted with KIT
D814V bearing cells with a combination of II-BO8 and
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 shows enhanced survival, than
treatment with II-BO8 or LY294002 alone. In another study,
downstream of activated KIT D814V receptor, a PI3Kinase/
RHOA mediated activation of ROCK1 was shown to
induce transformation and myeloproliferative neoplasm
18257

Oncotarget

in mice [76]. Genetic ablation of ROCK1 or targeting it
with a pharmacological inhibitor, H-1152, results in the
inhibition of myeloproliferative neoplasm and prolongs the
survival of these mice.
More recently, Martin et al. [77] demonstrated a
VAV1/RAC1/PAK signaling pathway downstream of KIT
D814V mutated receptor in triggering myeloproliferative
neoplasm in mice. These studies showed that targeting RAC
GTPases with a novel small molecule inhibitor Ehop-016
results in a significant repression of disease progression
in mice. Mechanistically, treating KIT D814V cells with
Ehop-016 results in enhanced cell death via repression of an
anti-apoptotic protein BAD. Along similar lines, Chatterjee
et al. [78] demonstrate a novel signaling pathway comprised
of FAK/TIAM1/RAC1/PAK1 in regulating the nuclear
translocation of active STAT5 with subsequent expression of
pro-survival genes resulting in MPN in mice, downstream of
oncogenic KIT D814V. Genetic ablation or pharmacological
inhibition of FAK or PAK1 resulted in repression of KIT
D814V induced MPN development in mice. Moreover
in these studies [77, 78], the authors also showed growth
repression of neoplastic MCs derived from SM patients that
were positive for KIT D816V mutation, when treated with
FAK and PAK1 inhibitors, indicating an essential role of
FAK and PAK1 in triggering KIT D816V induced SM.
In addition to a role for kinases and phosphatases
in regulating KIT D816V induced transformation, a
relationship between KIT D816V induced SM and
transcription factors like STAT5 and MITF is also evident
from recent studies. Hoermann et al. [79] demonstrated
that in KIT D816V bearing neoplastic mast cells, active
STAT5 induces expression of Oncostatin M (OSM), a key
modulator of bone marrow microenvironment. Increased
OSM expression causes increased angiogenesis, thickened
trabeculae and fibrosis; all pathological hallmarks of SM.
This study highlighted STAT5 and OSM as potential
targets to treat SM [79]. Like STAT5, another transcription
factor called microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF) is highly expressed in neoplastic cells
derived from bone marrow of SM patients harboring the
KIT D816V mutation [80]. At the microRNA (miRNA)
level, activating KIT D816V mutation represses the
expression of miR-539 and miR-381, which is normally
involved in down-regulating MITF in mast cells,
demonstrating that KIT D816V promotes the stability of
MITF which plays an essential role in proliferative effects
seen in mastocytosis. Although the above described
signaling pathways are exciting; they will however require,
further stringent analysis to determine whether genetic
lesions/mutations/sustained activation occur per se in
RAC1/PAK1/FAK/SHP2 molecules in neoplastic MCs
found in mastocytosis patients. Furthermore, a mouse
model developed by Gerbaulet et al. [60] that shows
many cardinal features of human mastocytosis due to
the presence of the activating KIT D814V mutation and
can be induced to express in multiple hematopoietic stem
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and progenitor cell lineages (stem cells vs. mast cells),
can be further utilized to determine the role of various
signaling molecules described above by targeting them
using pharmacological inhibitors or genetic ablation,
and analyzing their contribution to the development of
mastocytosis. These studies will be important to validate
SHP2/RAC1/PAK1/FAK as genuine therapeutic targets
for treating mastocytosis, along with clinical trials using
inhibitors against these molecules.

Current treatment options and challenges
The majority of patients diagnosed with
mastocytosis belong to the indolent category (ISM), a
form compatible with an individual’s life span. In patients
suffering from ISM, a minimum treatment however is
necessary, which includes management of symptoms,
anti-mediator drugs and careful monitoring of the disease.
In contrast, in patients diagnosed with an advanced/
aggressive form of SM, which is incurable, and results
in a shortened life expectancy; treatment with TKIs has
yielded disappointing results. In general, the type of
mutation in the KIT receptor determines the efficacy of
some of the known TKIs. Patients with KIT mutations
in the second catalytic domain (D816V/H/Y/N) tend
to demonstrate resistance to Imatinib [81]. This is due
to disruption of the conformation of the KIT D816V
mutant receptor, rendering the receptor permanently
active, which cannot be targeted by Imatinib. On the
other hand, treatment with Imatinib has yielded dramatic
improvement in MC burden and clinical symptoms
in patients with a history of CM harboring a germline
mutation in the KIT receptor (F522C). Most mutations
found in ECD of the KIT receptor, primarily those
detected in pediatric patients, respond well to Imatinib
[82, 83]. Likewise, Imatinib treatment of a MCL patient
with an ECD KIT mutation (A502-Y503dup) and of
patients with no mutations in the KIT receptor (i.e. WT
KIT) showed favorable outcomes [84]. Further, several
other TKIs have been developed in recent years that can
efficiently target the KIT D816V lesion. Dasatinib is
potent against cell lines harboring KIT D816V mutations,
unfortunately clinical trials yielded disappointing results
[51, 64, 85]. Midostaurin (PKC412) is a potent inhibitor
of PKC, VEGFR-2, PDGFR, FLT3 and KIT. It inhibits
the activity of KIT in HMC mastocytosis cell line, and
at pharmacological relevant concentrations against patient
derived neoplastic MCs in vitro. Consistent with the
in vitro observations, in several clinical trials, a significant
reduction in MC burden in patients with ASM and MCL
is observed using Midostaurin [41, 86]. Although initial
data from these clinical trials were encouraging, they
did not offer long-term remission. Besides TKIs, current
non-targeted cytoreductive therapy using Cladribine and
Interferon-α have also has shown encouraging results in
more aggressive forms of the disease (Table 2).
18258

Another aspect of KIT D816V resistance to current
therapies involves the presence of several KIT D816Vindependent signaling pathways that are likely to contribute
to the survival and abnormal growth of neoplastic MCs [64].
These KIT D816V-independent pathways may support the
presence of malignant subclone(s), which may contribute to
relapse in patients treated with TKIs who bear KIT D816V
negative neoplastic MCs. Thus, therapeutic targeting of
additional signaling pathways and molecules may also be a
prudent therapeutic approach to treat advanced/aggressive
forms of this disease.
One of the major means by which neoplastic
mast cells harboring the mutated KIT D816V receptors
achieve enhanced survival is through down-regulating
the expression of pro-apoptotic and up-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins. The mutated KIT D816V receptor
phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein BIM which
results in its degradation leading to enhanced survival.
The proteasomal inhibitor MG132 up-regulates the
expression of BIM and subsequently induces apoptosis
in KIT D816V harboring cells, providing a strong
rationale for using proteasomal inhibitors as a treatment
option for mastocytosis. Obatoclax, an inhibitor of antiapoptotic family of proteins (BCLXL, BCL2 and MCL1)
shows reduced growth and survival in cells expressing
KIT D816V mutation. Further, Obatoclax synergizes
and potentiates the activity of antineoplastic drugs such
as Dasatinib, Midostaurin and Bortezomib, highlighting
the importance of combination therapy for SM. Martin
et al. [77] showed increased apoptosis in KIT D814V
bearing cells with a novel RAC1 inhibitor Ehop-016
in part by repressing the expression of anti-apoptotic
proteins BAD and MLC, while Chatterjee et al. [78]
showed that pharmacological targeting of FAK and
PAK1 in KIT D816V cells results in down-regulation
of anti-apoptotic protein and mRNA levels of BCLXL.
A number of FAK inhibitors are currently in clinical
trials; whether future clinical studies incorporating FAK,
RAC1 and PAK1 inhibitors alone, or in combination
with other antineoplastic agents like Dasatinib and
Midostaurin provide a better treatment option for ASM
patients remains to be seen. Targeting PAK proteins as
a therapeutic strategy is currently been tried for various
malignancies; as more small molecule inhibitors with
increased specificity become available, they are likely
to be tested in SM patients. In addition to regulating
apoptosis, genetic ablation of PAK1 enhanced the survival
of KIT D814V bearing mice in secondary transplants,
indicating that targeting PAK1 inhibits the growth/
survival of KIT D814V bearing leukemia initiating cell
(LIC) [78]. It will be interesting to elucidate the LIC
containing fraction in the HSC pool that triggers KIT
D814V induced mastocytosis, which subsequently can be
targeted using PAK1 inhibitors. This will be an important
area of future research, as the LIC population is known
to survive conventional therapy, and the survival of LICs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has been implicated in the observed relapse often seen in
SM patients. Besides molecules described above, clinical
trials against BTK, PI3K and JAK have already shown
promising results in various other malignancies (discussed
earlier under “Alternate Therapeutic Strategy”). Thus
targeting BTK, PI3K, JNK in clinical trials involving
mastocytosis patients holds significant promise.
In addition to targeting the KIT D816V receptor and
its downstream substrates in SM, HMC cells and primary
neoplastic mast cells derived from aggressive SM patients
carrying the KIT D816V mutation appear to be sensitive to
treatment by demethylating agents including 5-azacytidine
(5-AZA) and 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (Decitabine / DAC).
5-AZA and DAC do not alter the expression of KIT
receptor, nor do they impact the activation of downstream
signaling proteins like AKT, STAT5 or STAT3; rather they
induce apoptosis by re-expression of FAS (Fas cell surface
death receptor) [87]. Importantly, 5-AZA and DAC do
not show any appreciable toxicity toward normal bone
marrow or mast cells. Along these lines, a combinatorial
approach involving Dasatinib (DASA) and DAC in
treating cells derived from SM patients that harbor the
KIT D816V and TET2 deletion was described [57]. Since
loss of TET2 causes aberrant methylation of promoter
regions in AML [88], a similar effect in SM patients was
predicted. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors
knocked down TET2 in HMC1.2 cells harboring the KIT
D816V mutation, and pre-treated cells with low doses of
DAC followed by DASA and determined cell death. Loss
of TET2 sensitized SM cells to a combination of drugs
(DAC+DASA), leading to significantly higher apoptosis,
than in cells treated with each drug alone [57]. This
approach paves the way for future treatment strategies
for KIT D816V positive and TET2 mutation carrying
SM patients, where pre-treatment with demethylating
agents like DAC followed by TKIs like Dasatinib and
Midostaurin may yield better therapeutic outcomes. In
addition to the above described strategy of using drug
combinations, a synergistic inhibitory effect exerted by
a combination treatment of Ponatinib and Midostaurin or
Dasatinib on the growth of neoplastic mast cells has also
been described [52]. Whether results from combination
treatments in vitro translate into successful clinical studies
remains to be seen, as it will take considerable effort to
elucidate the sequential order of drugs, and concentrations
that do not confer toxicity. Further, it might be valuable
to consider a three-pronged therapeutic approach for
the treatment of SM patients harboring the KIT D816V
mutation. In this scenario, co-targeting downstream
effector molecules such as SHP2, FAK, RAC1, and PAK1
along with the KIT D816V receptor itself using TKIs, and
epigenetic regulators with demethylating agents might
result in better outcomes (Figure 1).
The challenges posed by the mutated KIT D816V
receptor has resulted in the development of newer strategies
for designing potent inhibitors by exploiting the unique
18259

Oncotarget

structural conformation KIT receptor adopts in its active
versus its inactive state. Bai et al. [89] utilized a rational
drug design to target the ‘switch pocket’ (SP) region of
KIT that is occupied by different switch regions giving the
receptor either an ‘active’ or ‘inactive’ conformation. The
drugs DP-2976 and DP-4851 exhibit potent anti-neoplastic
activity against HMC and bone marrow mast cells derived
from SM patients [89]. These drugs hold significant promise
since mechanistically they function differently from current
drugs like Imatinib and Midostaurin, which are ATP
competitors, while DP-2976 and DP-4851 are non-ATP
competitors. Lee at al. [90] have reported the development
of a new series of 7-azaindole based inhibitors that show
a 100-fold increased sensitivity toward the KIT D816V
mutation than wild-type KIT receptor. It will be interesting
to see results using these drugs in future clinical trials.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives
In mastocytosis, both in the indolent (ISM) and in
the aggressive (ASM) form of the disease, mutations in
the KIT receptor (D816V and others) and genetic lesions
in various signaling molecules and modifiers are observed.
To treat the aggressive form of the disease, targeting
the activated version of the mutated KIT receptor with
drugs has been largely ineffective, therefore co-targeting
selective molecules in signaling pathways downstream of
the mutated KIT receptor is likely to be prudent therapeutic
strategy. Moreover, application of combination therapies
during the initial phase of disease may optimize the
clearance of neoplastic MC burden that may in-turn reduce
drug-resistance induced relapse. However, to efficiently
eradicate neoplastic MCs, targeting tumor stem/leukemia
initiating cells (LIC) is also necessary. Importantly, the
detection and quantification of KIT allele burden will be
critical for monitoring the disease, its prognosis during the
course of the disease and during/after therapies. Fortunately,
highly specific PCR-based assays are readily available that
should be incorporated as a standard routine in screening
mastocytosis patients with KIT mutations. Moreover, to
expand the breadth of screening for mutations in newly
described players in this disease such as TET2, ASXL1 and
SRSF2; methods such as next-generation sequencing (NGS)
and evaluation of myeloid-gene mutation panel are likely to
be of benefit [33]. These approaches will hopefully provide
the tools to diagnose and treat the mutational patterns,
course and aggressiveness of the disease and alleviate the
suffering in mastocytosis patients.
