ABSTRACT
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with high
mortality rates. Major challenges for OSCC management include development of
resistance to therapy and early formation of distant metastases. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) have emerged as important players in both pathologic mechanisms. Increased
fucosylation activity and increased expression of fucosylated polysaccharides, such
as Sialyl Lewis X (SLex), are associated with invasion and metastasis. However,
the role of fucosylation in CSCs has not been elucidated yet. We used the spheroid
culture technique to obtain a CSC-enriched population and compared orospheres with
adherent cells. We found that orospheres expressed markers of CSCs and metastasis
at higher levels, were more invasive and tumorigenic, and were more resistant to
cisplatin/radiation than adherent counterparts. We found fucosyltransferases FUT3
and FUT6 highly up-regulated, increased SLex expression and increased adhesion
by shear flow assays in orospheres. Inhibition of fucosylation negatively affected
orospheres formation and invasion of oral CSCs. These results confirm that orospheres
are enriched in CSCs and that fucosylation is of paramount importance for CSC
invasion. In addition, SLex may play a key role in CSC metastasis. Thus, inhibition of
fucosylation may be used to block CSCs and metastatic spread.

INTRODUCTION

Unfortunately, current treatments for HNSCC can be
traumatic and disfiguring, drastically affecting quality
of life [4, 5]. Management of HNSCC includes surgical
resection and/or a combination of chemo- and radiotherapy [1, 6]. Despite these treatments, the prognosis of
HNSCC remains poor due to late diagnosis, high rates of

Head and neck (H&N) squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is one of the world’s top ten most common
cancers: in fact, it is ranked the 8th and 13th most common
malignancy, respectively, for males and females [1-3].

primary-site recurrence, and common metastases to locoregional lymph nodes [2, 6, 7].
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which
includes epithelial neoplasms of the oral cavity and
oropharynx, accounts for the majority of HNSCCs [8]
and causes cancer-related mortality with an estimated
>275,000 new cases and >120,000 deaths per year
[9]. Despite the numerous advances in diagnosis and
treatment of oral cancer, mortality and morbidity rates
for OSCC are exceedingly high: the five-year survival
rate of stage I cancer including the various sub-sites, such
as borders of the tongue, floor of the mouth, cheek, and
gums, is approximately 80%, while the five-year survival
rate of patients with advanced disease (stages III/IV) is
approximately 20%. Worldwide, about 50% of OSCC
patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and the
available treatment modalities are still limited. Therefore,
novel treatment options and diagnostic tools are needed to
improve disease outcome.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subpopulation
of self-sustaining cancer cells with the ability to form
the heterogeneous cell lineages that compose the tumor
[10]. CSCs are characterized by three main features:
i) potent tumor initiation; ii) self-renewal in vivo
(observed practically via re-growth of phenotypically
indistinguishable tumors following serial transplantation
of re-isolated CSCs in secondary and tertiary recipients);
and iii) cell differentiation capacity, allowing them to give
rise to a heterogeneous progeny representing a phenocopy
of the original tumor [11]. CSCs have been proposed to be
responsible for the aggressive behavior of several cancer
types via the appropriation of the molecular machinery of
homing and mobilization involved in tumor invasion and
metastasis [12].
There are many methodologies to detect, isolate,
and characterize CSCs from tumors: the main methods
are cell sorting based on stemness marker expression, side
population profiling, and formation of floating spheres [1315]. Sphere formation in vitro allows selection of CSCrich populations, and this method is particularly useful
when specific CSC makers have not been well defined,
as is the case for most cancer types [16]. CSCs have been
identified in many solid tumors, including breast [17], lung
[18], colon [19], prostate [20], ovary [21], brain cancer
[22], and sarcoma [23]; in H&N cancer, the existence of
CSCs was first assessed using CD44 as a stem cell marker
[24].
Fucosyltransferases (FUTs) are a family of Golgiapparatus enzymes that transfer L-fucose from GDPfucose to a glycoside or a peptide. According to the
fucosylation site, FUTs are classified into alpha-1,2
(FUT1 and FUT2), alpha-1,3/4 (FUT3, FUT4, FUT5,
FUT6, FUT7, and FUT9), and alpha-1,6 (FUT8) [25].
In mammals, fucosylated glycans are involved in cell
adhesion during development [26, 27], the inflammatory
response, and leukocyte trafficking [28, 29]. Great
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

attention has been paid to FUTs and their inhibitors over
the past 20 years due to the fact that addition of L-fucose
is involved in a series of diseases, including cancer and
metastatic spread [30-33]. Sialyl Lewis X (SLex) is a
cell-surface tetrasaccharide carbohydrate involved in
many recognition processes. It is synthesized in the
Golgi compartment by different glycosyltransferases,
with the final step involving the transfer of L-fucose to
N-acetylglucosamine by alpha-1,3-FUT3/5/6/7, depending
on the cell type [34].
In this study, we extensively compared orospheres
with their adherent cell counterpart in terms of gene
expression, stem cell and metastasis marker profile,
cell adhesion and invasion, potential to form tumors in
an animal model, and resistance to drugs and radiation.
Moreover, we show that inhibition of fucosylation affects
the orosphere formation and invasion ability of CSCs.

RESULTS
Orospheres formation
The ability to grow in suspension in serum-free
medium was investigated with a tumor-initiating cellselection method. OSCC orospheres were clearly observed
already after 24 h in serum-free medium. After 7 days of
culture, orospheres were seeded onto standard plates with
10% FBS. Cells migrated from the spheres within a few
hours and adhered to the bottom of the flasks, assuming
their original shape.

Orospheres have protein and RNA expression
typical of CSCs and increased propensity to grow
in vivo
Orospheres and corresponding adherent cells of
two OSCC lines (UMSCC14B and UMSCC103) were
assessed for expression of CD44, CD29, CD56, sialyl
LewisX (SLeX), sialyl Lewis A (SLa) and Lewis Y (Ly)
as well as for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity.
CD44 and ALDH activity are the most common markers
of CSCs in OSCC [24, 35]; CD29 is a β1-integrin involved
in invasion and metastasis that has been used as a CSC
marker for different cancers [36]; and CD56 (N-CAM),
which we describe here for the first time in oral cancer,
has been correlated with invasion and distant metastasis
in many cancers [37-39].
Cytometric analyses revealed that orospheres were
remarkably more positive for ALDH activity than their
adherent counterpart. In UMSCC14B cells, CD44 was
more expressed on orospheres, while in the UMSCC103
cell line CD44 was more expressed by adherent cells.
Nevertheless, in both cell lines, CD44–ALDH doublepositivity was remarkably higher in orospheres than
72

corresponding adherent cells (Fig. 1A).
Similarly, CD29, CD56, and SLex were consistently
higher on orospheres than adherent cells (Fig1B). SLa
was highly expressed by UMSCC14B but only slightly
expressed by UMSCC103 cell lines. No variations were
observed between orospheres and adherent cells in both
cases. Ly had a different pattern, being more expressed
by orospheres in the UMSCC14B cell line, but more
expressed by adherent cells in the UMSCC103 cell line.
Neither SLa nor Ly seemed to be associated with the

orospheres culture condition (Fig. 1B).
RNA from orospheres and adherent cells from
both cell lines was extracted and PCR performed for
genes related to stemness and metastasis. ALDH RNA
expression was higher in orospheres of both cells lines,
showing that orospheres not only have higher enzyme
activity but that they also produce more ALDH. N-CAM
RNA expression levels were also consistently higher in
orospheres (Supplementary Table 1), as assessed by the
cytometric analysis. Furthermore, the RNAs of VEGF,

Orospheres are resistant to Cisplatin and
radiation treatment

CXCR2, MMP10, PAR6, and FXYD5 (dysadherin),
well-known markers associated with metastasis and poor
prognosis in different cancers, including OSSC [40-43],
were all up-regulated in orospheres (Supplementary Table
1), as were the RNAs of commonly recognized markers of
normal stem cells and CSCs, such as SOX-2, OCT3/4, and
NANOG (Fig. 1C).
To evaluate tumorigenic potential, orospheres and
adherent cells were injected into the flanks of NOD/SCID
immunodeficient mice. Tumor growth was measured
every three days after tumors were first detected. 24-27
days after implantation, both orospheres and adherent cells
were found to generate tumors in all cases, but although
the same number of cells were injected, tumor size and
growth of orospheres was significantly greater than that
of adherent cells (p<0.05) (Fig. 1D and 1E). Hematoxylin
and eosin staining revealed that the xerographs
reconstituted the characteristics of the original primary
tumor architecture (Fig. 1F).

We performed a preliminarily dose-response
evaluation of the growth inhibition induced by either
cisplatin or radiation on adherent cell lines after 24h
of treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). On the basis of
the results, we used for all the subsequent experiments
the concentrations that caused at least 20% cell death.
Therefore, the cell lines were treated with 80µM cisplatin
and cell death analyzed after 24 hours. In both cell lines,
orospheres had greater resistance to cisplatin-induced
death than the corresponding adherent cells (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Table 2). In particular, the UMSCC103
cell line had higher sensitivity to cisplatin treatment,
both as orospheres and adherent cells. In addition, IC50
was calculated from the dose-response curve assessed
with a MTT assay (Fig.2B). For both cell lines, IC50 of
orospheres was significantly higher than for adherent cells.

IC50 values were: 114 (95% CI 104-126) for UMSCC14B
adherent cells, 144 (95% CI 134-155) for UMSCC14B
orospheres, 26.5 (95% CI 18-39) for UMSCC103 adherent
cells, and 58 (95% CI 47-72) for UMSCC103 orospheres.
We also assessed radiation resistance. Even for
this death stimulus, orospheres were more resistant than
corresponding adherent cells (Fig. 2A). In both cell lines, a
slight increase of necrosis was also found (Supplementary
Fig. 2 and table 2). The findings were confirmed by colony
forming assay (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Table 2): while

adherent cells formed no or few colonies, orospheres were
consistently able to form visible colonies.

Orospheres are more invasive and show increased
fucosylation
The invasive ability of cells was then assessed with
a Matrigel invasion chamber assay. Orospheres derived
from the cell lines were significantly more invasive than

FUT inhibition reduces orospheres formation

adherent cells: UMSCC14B orospheres-derived cells had
a 2.4-fold increase, while those derived from UMSCC103
orospheres had a 1.75-fold increased ability to migrate
(Fig. 3A). Moreover, expression of FUT3 and FUT6
mRNA was significantly higher in orospheres (Fig. 3B),
but FUT5 and FUT7 were not expressed in either adherent
cells or orospheres (Fig. 3B). In addition, orospheres of
both cell lines had a strong increase in the fucosylated
carbohydrate SLex (Fig 3C). In order to further investigate
a possible relation between FUT and SLex expression,
we sorted cells for surface SLex, extracted the RNA, and
performed qPCR for FUTs 3/6 expression. In both cell
lines, the SLex+ subpopulation had a significantly higher
expression of FUTs (Fig 3D). Consequently, we found that
SLex+ cells had a significantly greater invasive ability than
SLex- cells. (Fig. 3E).
Shear flow is a functional analysis assessing the
ability of cells to roll and stick on E-selectin-expressing
endothelium. Rolling and adhesion to E-selectin
-expressing endothelial cells is a key step for metastasis
initiation. Orospheres-derived cells showed a significantly
greater ability to adhere to E-selectin-expressing CHO
cells than did adherent cells (Fig. 3F). In UMSCC14B
and UMSCC103 cells, adhesion of orosphere-derived
cells was respectively 2-fold and 3.58-fold greater than
their adherent counterpart. Rolling was not significantly
different in the former; in the latter, orospheres rolled at
slightly lower percentages than adherent cells, but the
difference was not significant (Fig. 3F).
Of note, the maximum velocity calculated for
UMSCC103 orospheres-derived cells (31.83 μm/s)
was about half that of the adherent cells (60.82 μm/s),
indicating that orospheres cells are more adherent to
the monolayer. This correlation was found also for the
UMSCC14B cell line.

In order to evaluate the effect of fucosylation on
orospheres formation, we incubated adherent cells with the
specific inhibitor 2F-peracetyl-fucose for 72 hours prior
to detaching the cells for orospheres formation. Inhibition
of fucosylation with 2F-peracetyl-fucose resulted in the
formation of fewer and smaller orospheres formation (Fig.
4A and B). Moreover, treatment significantly reduced
invasion ability of orospheres (Fig. 4C): UMSCC14B cells
had a 1.49-fold decrease, while UMSCC103 cells had a
1.7-fold decrease after treatment.

DISCUSSION
Prince el al. first described CSCs in H&N cancer as
a subpopulation of CD44+/CD24-/low cells [24]. Later, Clay
et al. used ALDH1 activity to additionally characterize the
stem-like subpopulation in H&N cancers [35]. Recently,
floating spheres have also been used to elucidate the roles
of CSCs in H&N cancer [44, 45].
To date, there is no available therapy targeting CSCs
directly. A detailed characterization of CSCs and the
discovery of new mechanisms involved in the metastatic
process, stem-like feature acquisition, and drug resistance
is necessary for the identification of more-effective
strategies against this aggressive and resistant subset of
cells. Increased fucosylation has been associated with
metastatic and invasive properties of cancer cells [46-48];
moreover, inhibition of fucosylation has been successfully
used against tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in
vivo [49, 50]. In this light, our aim was to understand
the role of fucosylation in CSCs-mediated invasion and
metastasis in OSCC.
We firstly characterized H&N-derived CSCs in
terms of marker expression, tumorigenic potential, and
metastatic and invasive ability. Both cell lines studied
were able to grow as orospheres that could be passaged

for at least three times. Orospheres and adherent cells were
analyzed comparatively for expression of several markers,
including ALDH activity and CD44. It is generally
accepted that ALDH activity and CD44 expression are
reliable markers for CSC identification in carcinomas
from the head and neck areas [24, 35, 51]. In our study,
orospheres from both cell lines had increased ALDH
activity compared with adherent counterparts. On the
other hand, CD44 expression was higher in UMSCC14B
orospheres than in adherent cells, differently to the
UMSCC103 cell line, in which CD44 was more expressed
on adherent cells. Nevertheless, the percentage of doublepositive cells for ALDH activity and CD44 expression was
higher in orospheres than in adherent cells for UMSCC14B
and UMSCC103 cell lines. Previous studies suggested that
CD44 is also highly expressed in normal oral epithelium,
similar to the expression detected in OSCC [52], while
various CD44 variant isoforms that arise from alternative
exon splicing are exclusively expressed in tumors, where
they were significantly associated with advanced primary
tumor stage, metastasis, treatment failure, and reduced
disease-free survival [53, 54]. For these reasons, CD44
should be used in combination with other markers for the
reliable identification of CSCs.
Furthermore, orospheres had a pattern of gene
expression typical of stem cells, characterized by upregulation of genes such as OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2.
These findings were reinforced by up-regulation of other
genes related not only to stemness but also to tumor
progression and negative outcome, including NCAM
and PAR-6 [42]. Interestingly, to our knowledge, CD56
(NCAM) has not been described before in OSCC-derived
CSCs. NCAM is an homophilic binding glycoprotein
expressed on the surface of various cells (e.g. neurons,
glia, skeletal muscle, and natural killer cells), which
has been correlated to invasion and distant metastasis in
many human cancers, including small cell lung cancer,
thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinomas, and glioma
[37-39]. In order to better understand the potential links
between CSCs and metastasis formation, we performed
PCR arrays for genes related to metastasis. We found that
orospheres overexpressed several genes, such as VEGF,
FXYD5 (dysadherin), CXCR2, and MMP10, that have been
strongly correlated with invasion and metastasis in many
cancers, including H&N carcinomas [40, 41, 43].
Two of the most important characteristics of CSCs
are the ability to generate tumors in immunocompromised
mice [19, 44] and resistance to conventional therapy [44,
55]. Here, we have demonstrated that tumors originating
from orospheres grow faster and bigger than those
originating from adherent cells, confirming the capacity of
orospheres to initiate and sustain tumor growth. Moreover,
cells derived from orospheres were significantly more
resistant to cisplatin and radiation treatment than adherent
cells. These results strongly suggest that orospheres
are enriched in CSCs and that they represent a highly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reproducible model for studying CSCs in OSCC.
Sialyl Lewis X is an E-selectin ligand with a
carbohydrate structure that is constitutively expressed
on granulocytes and monocytes, mediating inflammatory
extravasation of these cells [56]. We found that SLex
expression was strongly associated with orospheres,
confirming our recent preliminary report [57]. In
different cancers, SLex expression has been related to
poor prognosis and metastasis, suggesting that it may be
involved in cancer cell extravasation [58-61]. Consistently,
we found increased expression of FUT3 and FUT6
(involved in SLex synthesis) in orospheres concurrently
to increased levels of SLex. In our model, other FUT3/6
products, such as SLa and Sly, were not associated with
the orosphere culture condition. The expression pattern
of these two Lewis family saccharides is discordant with
the increase in FUT3/6 that we found in orospheres,
suggesting that other enzymes may be responsible for
their regulation. At the same time, sorted SLex+ adherent
cells expressed significantly higher levels of FUT3/6 than
did SLex- cells. In addition a causal correlation between
FUT3/6 and SLex levels has been showed in other
models[34, 62-65]
Taken together, these findings strongly suggest
that increased expression of FUT3/6 is associated with
increased SLex production. An invasion assay indicated
that SLex+ cells (with high FUTs expression) levels
were significantly more invasive than SLex- cells (with
low FUTs), suggestive of an association between FUTs
expression and invasive phenotype.
Moreover, shear flow assays, mimicking the
potential interaction between tumor cells and endothelium,
showed that orospheres are remarkably more able to
adhere to E-selectin-expressing cell layer, a feature that is
of paramount importance for distant metastasis formation
[60, 66]. We did not find a significant difference in the
number of rolling cells, but we did find a consistent and
substantial difference in firmly adherent cell number and
in the mean velocity of rolling cells. Thus, orospheresderived CSCs have greater ability to bind to E-selectin.
SLex is the main E-selectin ligand, and we found it
to be overexpressed on orospheres-derived cells with
increased FUT3/6 expression. 2F-peracetyl-fucose is the
only commercially available inhibitor of fucosylation
[67]. We show that inhibition of fucosylation negatively
affects orospheres formation, producing smaller-sized
spheroids. Sphere formation is widely used to enrich the
CSC population, and is recognized as a standard tool
to assess and confirm self-renewal in stem-like cells.
Interestingly, inhibition of fucosylation also affected
invasion ability of sphere-derived CSCs. Even though in
vitro migration assays are not comprehensive methods for
broad characterization of the invasive process, they have
been extensively used and correlated to cancer invasion
in vivo [63, 64]. Moreover, inhibition of fucosylation
affects E-selectin binding and cell extravasation [49],
77

Oncotarget

and Cheng et al. [68] showed that FUT family members,
including FUT6, are involved in multidrug resistance in
hepatocellular carcinomas. Based on this previous data
and on the findings of this study, we hypothesize that
increased fucosylation may be a mechanism used by CSCs
to acquire not only invasive and metastatic features, but
also resistance to conventional therapy.

20ng/ml) and epidermal growth factor (EGF, 20ng/
ml) (both from Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) were added
every other day. After 48–72 hours, orospheres were
enzymatically dissociated and re-cultured in the same
condition to form second- and then third-passage
orospheres, which were used for experiments. Inhibition of
fucosylation was obtained as described by Rillahan et al.
[67] using the fucosyltransferase inhibitor 2F-PeracetylFucose (Millipore Calbiochem, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany) at 64 μM for 72 hours prior to performing
experiments. To assess effect of 2F-Peracetyl-Fucose on
orosphere formation, the number and size of orospheres
were measured. At least 50 spheres for each sample were
measured, reporting the diameter as mean with 95%
confidence interval. 2F-Peracetyl-Fucose did not affect
viability at the concentration used (Supplementary Figure
3).

CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates the following: (i) orospheres
are enriched in CSCs, express higher levels of metastatic
markers, and are more tumorigenic than adherent
counterparts; and (ii) fucosylation is of paramount
importance in the invasion and metastatic process of
CSCs. Among fucosylated saccharides, Sialyl Lewis X is
a strong candidate in the acquisition of a FUT-associated
invasive phenotype. Thus, inhibition of fucosylation may
represent an active therapeutic tool against cancer stem
cells and metastatic spreading.

Phenotypic characterization and ALDH activity
assay of orospheres vs adherent cells

METHODS

For flow cytometry, adherent cells were detached
with trypsin/versene dissociation medium (Gibco, NY,
USA). Briefly, the culture medium was discharged, cells
were washed in PBS, and dissociation medium added and
kept until cells detached from flasks. For dissociation
of spheres, spheres were collected by centrifugation,
washed with PBS (Gibco, NY, USA), and then 1 ml of
dissociation medium added until the orospheres were
completely dissociated. Cells were re-suspended at 1x106/
ml and incubated with primary antibody for 30 minutes
on ice in the dark. Secondary antibodies, when needed,
were added after a PBS wash for 30 minutes in the same
conditions. Primary antibodies were PE-CD24, PE/Cy5CD29, FITC-CD56 (N-CAM), not conjugated CD15s
(SleX, mouse IgM), and APC-CD44 (BD, CA, USA). SLa
(sialyl Lewis A, mouse IgG) and Ly (Lewis Y, mouse IgM)
were not conjugated (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Alexa488conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgM and IgG antibodies
were purchased from Life Technologies (NY, USA).
The Aldefluor kit (STEMCELL Technologies,
BC, Canada) was used to identify cell populations
with high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity.
Briefly, 106 harvested cells were resuspended in
Aldefluor assay buffer containing ALDH substrate, as
recommended by the producer. As a negative control for
all samples, an aliquot of “Aldefluor-exposed” cells was
immediately quenched with a specific ALDH inhibitor,
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). After incubation for
30 min at 4°C and following centrifugation, the cells were
resuspended in cold Aldefluor buffer, and stained with 1
µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA)
to discriminate viable from dead cells. Aldefluor staining
was detected in a green fluorescence channel. Samples
treated with the inhibitor DEAB (+DEAB) were used as

OSCC cell lines (UMSCC14B, UMSCC103),
used in this study were established at the University of
Michigan under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board Office in accordance with the university’s
regulations [69, 70]. Cells were cultured in DMEM
(Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine,
100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen Life Technologies, NY, USA)
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2. Cells
were passaged at a split ratio of 1:3–1:6. The cell lines
used in this study were negative in periodic monitoring
for mycoplasma. The cell lines were also genotyped to
rule out cross-contamination and their morphology was
regularly examined.
For orosphere formation, cells were plated at a
density of 3 × 105 cells in 25 cm2 ultra-low-attachment
flasks (Corning, NY, USA) in DMEM/F12 supplemented
with B27 and N2 supplement (Gibco, NY, USA), 100 IU/

controls to set the gates defining the ALDH+ region. Flow
cytometry analyses and sorting were performed at the
University of Michigan Flow Core using a FACS ARIA
III (Becton Dickinson), a MoFlow Astrios (Beckman
Coulter, Inc), a FACS Canto III (Becton Dickinson), or a
MacsQuant (Miltenyi Biotec). All data were analyzed by
Flow-Jo software (Tree Star, Inc).

Cisplatin (cis-diammineplatinum (II) dischloride,
DDP) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved
in sterile 0.9% NaCl to achieve a stock concentration of
5 mM. Cells were plated 3–5x105 in 25cm2 flasks, left to
grow for 24 hours, and then treated. To establish cisplatin
dosage for further experiments, cytotoxic curves were
performed with Annexin V/PI staining kit on adherent
cells at the concentrations of 2 µM, 5 µM, 20 µM, 40 µM,
80µM, and 100µM for 24 hours (Supplementary Figure 1).
The cisplatin dose was chosen in order to produce at least
20% reduction in viability. Cells were then treated with
cisplatin 80µM for 24 hours in the subsequent experiment.

RNA isolation, qRT-PCR, and PCR arrays
Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol
(Invitrogen, NY, USA). RNA (2 µg) was reverse
transcribed with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents
(Applied Biosystems, Branchbury, NJ, USA), following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. The resulting
cDNA was then amplified by real time RT-PCR (qRTPCR) using AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied
Biosystems). The RT-PCR products were subcloned
into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and
confirmed by sequencing. For RNA quantification, qRTPCR amplifications were performed at 95°C for 30 s,
60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s using specific primers for
the house-keeping gene β-actin (Actb). The PCR primers
sequences are given in Supplementary Table 1. The
relative expression levels for each gene were calculated
based on the expression levels of Actb and the differences
are presented in graphs using the 2-ΔΔCT method.
P-values were calculated using two-sample t-test.
PCR arrays were purchased from Qiagen (QIAGEN,
Valencia, CA). The arrays and data analyses were
performed at University of Michigan’s DNA core.

In vitro treatment with radiation
Cells are irradiated at the Experimental Irradiation
Core of the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University
of Michigan. 250kV X-ray radiation (Philips RT250,
Kimtron Medical) was delivered at a dose rate of
approximately 2 Gy/min. Dosimetry was carried out with
an electrometer system directly traceable to a National
Institute of Standards and Technology calibration. Both
cell lines considered were given 6 Gy.

IC50 calculation and MTT assay
In order to calculate IC50, a dose-response curve
was obtained by treating both cell lines with cisplatin,
either in adherent or sphere culture conditions. Cells were
plated at 1×104 per well in 96-well plates before treatment
with the following concentrations of cisplatin: 2 µM, 5
µM, 20 µM, 40 µM, 80µM, 120 µM, and 180 µM. After
24 h of treatment, MTT solution (1 mg/mL in PBS) was
added to each well. The plates were then incubated at
37 °C for 4 h, and reduced purple-blue MTT formazan
crystals were solubilized by adding 200 μL of DMSO to
each well. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm using
a microplate ELISA reader, with DMSO used as the blank.
IC50 was calculated using Prism GraphPad Sofware
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA).

Xenograft formation in NOD/SCID mice
Adherent cells and orospheres were enzymatically
dissociated to obtain single-cell suspensions, diluted to
5x104/50μl in PBS, mixed with 50 µl of Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson, CA, USA), and injected subcutaneously
in 6-week-old female NOD/SCID mice (Harlan Italy,
Milan, Italy). Each mouse received an adherent cell
injection in the left flank and a spheroid-cell injection
in the right flank. Mice were monitored every 3 days for
the appearance of subcutaneous tumors. Tumor size was
measured weekly with calipers. Tumor volume (V) was
calculated as follows: V = W2×L×0.5, where W and L
were tumor width and length, respectively. After 45 days,
mice were sacrificed, and the tumor tissue was collected
and fixed in buffered formalin. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stain was performed to determine tumor histology.
All procedures and experiments involving animals were
approved and conducted according to the regulations of
the Animal Ethic Committee of the Second University of
Naples.

Colony Forming Assay
Orospheres and adherent cells received either 80 µM
cisplatin for 24 hours or 6 Gy. Cells were then washed
twice with PBS, adherent cell detached, and orospheres
disaggregated using trypsin/EDTA for 5 minutes. Cells
were then seeded at 250/cm2. Untreated cells for both
adherent cultures and orospheres were used as control
and to assess plating efficiency. Cultures were observed
for 7–14 days (depending on growth rate differences
between cell lines) to allow untreated cells to reach >50

cells/colony. Colonies were then fixed and stained with
crystal violet in 20% methanol. Plating efficiency (PE)
was calculated by dividing the number of colonies formed
in the no treatment group by the number of cells seeded
(PE=# of colonies formed/# of cells seeded). Survival
fraction (SF) was determined by colonies formed after
treatment divided by the number of cells seeded multiplied
by the plating efficiency (SF=# colonies formed/# of cells
seeded x PE). All experiments were done in triplicate.

upper side of the membrane were removed with cotton
swabs and the invading cells were fixed using methanol
and stained with hematoxylin. Cells that invaded were
counted at 200X magnification. Each assay was performed
in triplicate. Invasion was calculated as percentage of cells
that invaded the Matrigel insert compared to the number of
cells that migrate in the control insert.

Statistical analysis

Shear flow assay

Statistical analyses were carried out by University
of Michigan Center for Statistical Consultation and
Research (CSCAR). An Independent Samples test was run
using the SPSS program to analyze the significance of the
differences found. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant. In all graphs, error bars
represent the 95% confidence interval.

Regular and E-selectin stably transfected Chinese
Hamster Ovarian cells (CHO and E-sel-CHO cells were
a gift from Dr Lloyd Stoolman, Pathology Department,
University of Michigan), that grow as monolayers in
culture, were maintained in MEM-α media (20% FBS,
1X NEAA, 1X pen-strep). CHO cells were counted using
a Beckman Coulter Counter and then incubated with the
fluorescent marker CFSE (5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester) diluted with PBS (25 μM)
for 30 minutes. The cells were then centrifuged for 5
minutes at 1300 rpm, re-suspended at 1 x 106 cell/ml
and incubated for 30 minutes in DMEM media (10%
FBS, 1X NEAA, 1X pen-strep). The tumor cells were
perfused over the CHO monolayer at 1.4 dynes/cm2 using
a Harvard Apparatus. The shear force was calculated using
the equation y=6Qµ/bh2, where y is the shear force in
dynes/cm2, Q is the flow rate in mL/sec, µ is the apparent
viscosity (which is 0.01 poise for water at 32°C), and b
is the width and h is the height of the gasket. A gasket
with dimensions of 0.005 cm in height and 0.25 cm wide
was used. A computer software program, SIMPLE40, was
employed to analyze the recorded video in conjunction
with a standard CCD camera. Two-minute segments of the
videos were analyzed at various time points and positions
throughout the flow adhesion assay. An average was taken
of the total number of cells that were either considered
rolling or sticking to the monolayer, so that a value of
cells per field was obtained and compared. ‘Rolling’ cells
were considered to have velocities from 1.2–100 μm/s;
‘sticking’ cells had velocities of 0–1.2 μm/s.
