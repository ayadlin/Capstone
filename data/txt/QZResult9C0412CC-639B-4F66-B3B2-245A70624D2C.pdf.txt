Sensitivity to Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxicity by
Enabling Missing-Self Recognition

Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells can recognize and kill tumor cells lacking “self” markers, such as class I MHC, but
the basis for this recognition is not completely understood. NKR-P1 receptors are members of the C-type
lectin-related NK receptor superfamily that are conserved from rodents to humans. Identification of Clr ligands for the NKR-P1 receptors has facilitated functional analysis of MHC-independent target cell recognition
by NK cells. One receptor-ligand pair, NKR-P1B:Clr-b, can mediate “missing-self” recognition of tumor and
infected cells, but the role of this axis in sensing stressed cells remains unknown. Here, we show that Clr-b
is rapidly downregulated in cells undergoing genotoxic and cellular stress at the level of both RNA and surface
protein. Stress-mediated loss of Clr-b on leukemia cells enhanced cytotoxicity mediated by NKR-P1B+ NK cells.
Notably, Clr-b downregulation was coordinated functionally with stress-mediated upregulation of NKG2D ligands (but not class I MHC). Our findings highlight a unique role for the MHC-independent NKR-P1B:Clr-b
missing-self axis in recognition of stressed cells, and provide evidence of two independent levels of Clr-b regulation in stressed cells. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7102–13. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Innate immunity constitutes an important front-line defense and barrier to infectious disease and malignancies
(1). Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes capable
of recognizing and eliminating a wide variety of target cells,
including transformed, infected, transplanted, antibodycoated, and stressed cells (2, 3). NK effector mechanisms include cellular cytotoxicity mediated by perforin, granzymes,
and cell surface molecules (e.g., FasL, tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and rapid secretion of
cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, chemokines;
ref. 2). Although NK cells are tolerant to normal “self” cells,
they frequently respond to abnormal cells undergoing pathologic alterations. How NK cells mediate self–nonself discrimination at the molecular level remains the focus of
intense research.
The frequent correlation between heightened NK cytotoxicity and a lack of MHC-I expression on tumor cell lines

led to the hypothesis that NK cells sense the absence of self
MHC-I markers on target cells. Termed “missing-self” recognition (4), this pathway is governed by inhibitory receptors
specific for self MHC-I molecules that normally override
stimulatory NK-target interactions. In turn, the loss of
MHC-I molecules upon malignant transformation or infection becomes sufficient to trigger NK cytotoxicity via disinhibition of effector function (5). However, this mechanism
alone is insufficient to explain the complex outcomes that
regulate NK-target interplay.
Indeed, other potent stimulatory NK receptors such as
NKG2D recognize “induced-self” ligands dynamically upregulated during stress responses. Thus, a contemporary dualrecognition model proposes that NK cell function is regulated
by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory receptor signals,
which in turn are determined by target cell modulation of
numerous cognate ligands (3, 6). This more target-centric
model highlights the need to understand how both NK cell
receptors and their cognate ligands are modulated in real time
under pathologic conditions to fully appreciate complex NK
recognition events in vivo.
The underlying molecular basis behind the ability of NK
cells to recognize “stressed” cells remains incompletely understood. Recent evidence indicates that cells exposed to
chemotherapeutic agents, genotoxic stimuli, or stalled DNA
replication cycles dynamically upregulate stimulatory
NKG2DL (7). This induced-self ligand modulation is mediated in part through the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, in particular involving ATR, ATM, and Chk1 (8).
NKG2DL upregulation has been observed in response to
diverse genotoxic stimuli (including aphidicolin, cisplatin,

5-fluorouracil, γ-irradiation, and UV radiation; ref. 9), as well
as heat shock responses (10), antigen-mediated activation of
T cells (11–13), and dysregulation of Dicer expression (14). In
addition, ligands for other stimulatory NK receptors, such as
DNAM-1 (CD226), seem to be similarly upregulated (15).
However, the modulation of inhibitory NK ligands during
stress responses remains undocumented to date.
In addition to MHC-I molecules, several MHC-independent inhibitory ligands have recently been characterized,
including Clr-b (Clec2d), the ligand for the NKR-P1B (Klrb2)
receptor (3, 16–20). Importantly, the expression pattern
of Clr-b closely resembles that of classic MHC-I antigens.
Clr-b is widely expressed on normal hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells and is frequently lost on tumor cells (16).
Moreover, like MHC-I, Clr-b expression is rapidly downregulated following cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (21). Thus,
Clr-b seems to be lost under numerous pathologic circumstances, and might function as an inhibitory rheostat in
the routine detection of abnormal cells. Although the mechanism(s) governing Clr-b regulation remain to be elucidated,
events leading to transformation or infection seem to initiate
a programmed cellular response pathway culminating in the
loss of Clr-b at the cell surface (17, 21). This intrinsic host
response pathway differs from the extrinsic CTL-selected
or immunoevasin-induced loss of MHC-I on tumor or infected cells, and thus, might share common elements known
to be involved in the DDR pathway responsible for NKG2DL
upregulation.
In this report, we investigated the influence of cell stress
on Clr-b expression. Various chemotherapeutic agents and
inducers of genotoxic or physiologic stress were found to
promote a rapid functional downregulation of Clr-b transcripts and cell surface protein. Notably, MHC-I cell surface
molecules were not substantially altered by similar treatments (or actually increased). Extending previous work,
NKG2DL upregulation was found to be blocked by both caffeine and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing of
the ATR and Chk1 pathway (9). However, Clr-b downregulation was differentially affected by caffeine treatment and remained largely unaffected by shRNA-mediated knockdown of
the ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 pathways. This suggests that
loss of Clr-b following genotoxic stress may occur independently of the classic DDR pathway. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Clr-b transcripts prevented stress-mediated loss
of Clr-b surface protein. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition
of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway uncoupled
the downregulation of Clr-b surface protein from the stressmediated loss of endogenous Clr-b transcripts. Collectively,
these results show that genotoxic stress promotes missingself regulation of the NK inhibitory ligand, Clr-b, at both
the RNA and surface protein levels.

tin-A, tunicamycin, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, caffeine, H2O2,
α-amanitin, actinomycin-D, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem. γ-Irradiation was performed using
a Gammacell-1000 Cs-source irradiator. UV-C irradiation was
performed using a XL-1000 Spectrolinker. Chemicals were
dissolved in DMSO, water, or PBS, according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Mice, cell lines, and tissue culture
C1498 and NIH3T3 cells were purchased directly from
American Type Culture Collection and validated independently using our own in-house stocks. MNK-1 was generated
in our laboratory from primary mouse fetal thymic NK cells,
as described previously (22). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and interleukin (IL)-2 lymphokine-activated
killer (LAK) cells were generated from B6 and CD-1 mice
bred and maintained in our own facilities. Cells were maintained in complete medium (DMEM-HG plus 10% FCS and
supplements); MNK-1 cells were maintained in rhIL-2 (300
units/mL of Proleukin; Novartis) and routinely tested for
IL-2 dependence (22). All cell lines (C1498, NIH3T3, MNK-1,
and MEF) were authenticated by flow cytometry for expression of MHC-I and CD45 alleles, Clr-b, and various lineage
markers (including NK1.1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD11b,
CD11c, and Gr-1). Cell lines were maintained in culture for
less than 6 months (frequently 1–2 months) following resuscitation from stocks within one passage of expansion prior to
freezing. Fibroblasts were maintained in a subconfluent state
at all times to prevent the formation of foci, and all cells were
maintained in logarithmic growth phase prior to treatment.
Cell responses were independently validated following
1 week of culture in Normocin (Invivogen) to ensure the absence of Mycoplasma. For most treatments, 2 × 105 to 5 × 105
cells were seeded in 2 mL of complete medium in six-well
plates and dosed for 24 hours, with or without 1-hour pretreatments with caffeine, MG132, or lactacystin.

Materials and Methods

Flow cytometric analysis
All commercial monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were
purchased from BD PharMingen or eBioscience. Biotinylated
antimouse Clr-b mAb (4A6 mAb; ref. 16) was generated
previously. NKG2DL was visualized using NKG2D/hIgG
fusion protein (23) plus goat anti-hIgG-PE (Jackson ImmunoResearch). MHC-I levels were analyzed using anti-KbDb mAb.
Streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin or streptavidin-allophycocyanin
were used as secondary reagents (Invitrogen). Cells were
stained as described (22), then analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer and FlowJo software (TreeStar). All plots
show cells gated for viable cells, as determined by live-cell
gating by forward scatter, side scatter, and lack of propidium
iodide uptake; viability for all experiments was >80% to 90%.

Cr-release cytotoxicity assays
LAK effector cells were prepared from bone marrow cells and
splenocytes grown in complete medium containing 1,000 to
2,000 units/mL of rhIL-2 plus 15 ng/mL of mIL-15 (Peprotech)
for 5 to 6 days. Lysis assays were performed as described (16).
Retroviral transduction
The full-length Clr-b coding sequence was subcloned into
pMSCV2.2-CMV-IRES-GFP. Retroviral shRNA constructs
based on the pMND-Banshee vector (which contains an
LTR-driven GFP reporter gene) were previously characterized and validated (9). Stable transductants were generated
as described (16), sorted for GFP, and expanded for 5 days
before analysis.

Results
Rapid and dose-dependent loss of cell surface Clr-b in
response to diverse genotoxic agents
We have previously shown that Clr-b is broadly expressed
on most normal cells, yet frequently lost on tumor cells; this

renders transformed target cells more susceptible to NK
cytotoxicity via NKR-P1B–mediated missing-self recognition
(16). However, the underlying basis for the loss of Clr-b during
transformation remains unclear (3). To gain better insight into
the regulation of Clr-b expression, we investigated whether
Clr-b levels are influenced by genotoxic stress, an initiating
event in transformation (9). To this end, several Clr-b+ mouse
cell lines were screened for their responses to various genotoxic agents, then evaluated for surface expression of Clr-b
(16). For comparison, we also monitored the expression of
classic MHC-I molecules and NKG2DL (23).
As previously shown (16), C1498 cells (NKT-like acute leukemia; ref. 25), MNK-1 cells (IL-2–dependent thymic pre-NK
line; ref. 22), NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and MEF cells express high
levels of cell surface Clr-b. Strikingly, treatment of these cells
with chemotherapeutic agents and chemicals known to induce genotoxic stress promoted a rapid downregulation of
Clr-b surface protein (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Loss
of Clr-b expression was a rapid and dynamic event, and
the magnitude of downregulation was controlled in a doseand time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To investigate distinct

response to a variety of chemotherapeutic and genotoxic
agents, as well as agents that induce alternative stress
responses. Several but not all genotoxic agents efficiently

promoted Clr-b downregulation in four cell lines at pharmacologic doses within 24 hours (Fig. 1B; Supplementary

effects on Clr-b expression, including (a) camptothecin

and etoposide (topoisomerase-I/II inhibitors); (b) trichostatin-A and Scriptaid (histone deacetylase inhibitors); and (c)
γ-irradiation, bleomycin, and phleomycin (ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents). This highlights a correlation between similar stress response pathways and the
extent of Clr-b downregulation.
In contrast, NKG2DL was frequently upregulated under
these conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 9), whereas
MHC-I surface levels remained largely unaffected (or increased somewhat; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Collectively,
these combined responses are expected to enhance the susceptibility of target cells to NK cytotoxicity. Because heterogeneity in responses existed among the cells tested, factors
such as transformation state, cell type, or other cell-intrinsic
properties might influence the degree or magnitude of Clr-b
or NKG2DL modulation. Notably, Clr-b was strongly and consistently downregulated on several cell lines in response to
treatment with aphidicolin (DNA replication inhibitor), cisplatin (DNA crosslinking agent), and roscovitine (CDK inhibitor), but not bleomycin (DNA-cleaving radiomimetic; Figs. 1
and 2; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Therefore, we tested whether
the responses to these agents had functional consequences
on NK recognition.
Genotoxic stress enhances susceptibility to NK
cytotoxicity and diminishes NKR-P1B–mediated
recognition of Clr-b ligand
Loss of surface Clr-b on cells undergoing genotoxic stress
would be expected to enhance NK cytotoxicity, as previously
observed for tumor cells (16). To address this, treated target
cells were analyzed in standard 51 Cr-release cytotoxicity
assays. C1498 targets were used because they represent a model acute leukemia cell line used broadly in cytotoxicity assays
(26, 27), they are one of few tumor lines that express high levels
of Clr-b (16), and they modulate Clr-b but not other known NK
ligands in response to several genotoxic agents. To further
control for receptor specificity, we took advantage of known
NKR-P1B allelic polymorphisms between two mouse strains,
CD-1 and B6, which have been previously shown to influence
the magnitude of Clr-b–dependent inhibition in cytotoxicity
assays: CD-1 strain LAK cells are strongly inhibited via the
NKR-P1BCD-1 allele, whereas B6-strain LAK cells are only
weakly inhibited via the NKR-P1BB6 allele (a.k.a., NKR-P1D;
ref. 28), in response to target cells expressing Clr-b (16, 29).
Because the NKR-P1B receptor is known to exhibit variegated
expression on NK subsets (3, 29), the use of CD-1 strain LAK
allowed us to monitor surface expression of the NKR-P1BCD-1
allele (via PK136 mAb; refs. 3, 16, 22, 28), whereas mAbs
specific for the NKR-P1B B6 allele are not commercially
available (18, 29).
As shown in Fig. 3A, both bone marrow–derived and
splenic LAK cells from CD-1 mice express high levels of
NKR-P1B. Furthermore, C1498 targets treated with aphidicolin
or cisplatin possess strongly reduced levels of surface Clr-b,
whereas NKG2DL and MHC-I surface levels remain largely
unaltered (Figs. 1, 2, and 3B). In contrast, C1498 cells treated
with roscovitine lose Clr-b and induce NKG2DL, whereas cells
treated with bleomycin maintain Clr-b levels and moderately

www.aacrjournals.org

upregulate NKG2DL. As expected, treatment with genotoxic
agents rendered C1498 targets more sensitive to cytotoxicity
mediated by CD-1 strain LAK (Fig. 3C). Moreover, target
cytotoxicity was increased to a greater extent in response
to aphidicolin, cisplatin, or roscovitine (which strongly downregulate Clr-b), compared with bleomycin (which does not
promote loss of Clr-b). On the other hand, cytotoxicity
mediated by B6-strain LAK was minimally affected by aphidicolin or cisplatin whereas cytotoxicity was increased by
roscovitine or bleomycin, consistent with the moderate
increase in NKG2DL expression observed in the latter treatments. Importantly, known receptor polymorphisms affecting
CD-1 versus B6 LAK function are limited to the NKR-P1B
and Ly49 receptors, yet MHC-I levels do not change upon
aphidicolin or cisplatin treatment. This rules out a role for
loss of MHC-I ligands or induction of stimulatory ligands
recognized by nonpolymorphic NK receptors in contributing
to the augmented cytotoxicity observed for CD-1 strain LAK.
This strongly argues that enhanced cytotoxicity mediated by
NKR-P1B+ LAK is due to loss of Clr-b expression on C1498
targets exposed to the genotoxic agents, aphidicolin and
cisplatin.
To specifically address the loss of surface Clr-b ligand function in isolation, BWZ reporter assays were performed. Here,
BWZ.36 reporter cells (24) expressing a chimeric CD3ζ/NKRP1B fusion-receptor (BWZ.CD3ζ/P1B cells; ref. 16) were used
to assess NKR-P1B–dependent recognition of treated stimulator cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, BWZ.CD3ζ/P1B reporter cells
respond specifically to stimulator cells expressing Clr-b ligand,
whereas BWZ− parental cells fail to respond. Next, C1498 stimulator cells were incubated in situ for 24 hours with various
genotoxic agents in 96-well plates, followed by washing and
overnight incubation with BWZ− or BWZ.CD3ζ/P1B reporter
cells. Importantly, these results confirm that Clr-b ligand
function is lost in a dose-dependent manner, yet only in
response to genotoxic agents that downregulate Clr-b cell
surface expression (i.e., aphidicolin, cisplatin, roscovitine,
but not bleomycin; Fig. 3D; Figs. 1 and 2). This loss of cognate
ligand function was independently confirmed with three
other cell lines treated with the same four genotoxic agents
(data not shown).
Potential involvement of the ATM/ATR pathways in
stress-mediated Clr-b downregulation
Previous studies showed a role for the DDR pathway in
aphidicolin-induced NKG2DL upregulation on fibroblasts (via
ATR/Chk1), as well as constitutive NKG2DL expression on tumor cells (via ATM; refs. 8, 9). In these studies, inhibition of the
ATM/ATR pathways using caffeine abrogated NKG2DL upregulation on fibroblasts in response to aphidicolin treatment
(9). Therefore, we investigated the involvement of this pathway in stress-mediated Clr-b downregulation. Interestingly,
caffeine blocked both Clr-b downregulation and NKG2DL
upregulation on NIH3T3 fibroblasts in response to aphidicolin treatment (Fig. 4A and B). However, caffeine did not
block aphidicolin-mediated loss of Clr-b on C1498 leukemia
cells; rather, caffeine treatment alone promoted Clr-b downregulation, and the combination of caffeine and aphidicolin

promoted a more striking loss of Clr-b. As a control, constitutive NKG2DL expression and stress-mediated NKG2DL
upregulation were abrogated on both C1498 leukemia cells
and NIH3T3 fibroblasts by caffeine (Fig. 4A and B). These
findings are consistent with differential effects observed previously: The ATR pathway seems to regulate aphidicolininduced NKG2DL on fibroblasts, whereas the ATM pathway
might regulate constitutive NKG2DL expression on some
tumor cells (8, 9).
Because caffeine exhibits pleiotropic effects independent
of ATR/ATM inhibition (30–33), previously characterized
shRNA vectors (9) were used to specifically silence the
ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 gene products, and then Clr-b
modulation on C1498 and NIH3T3 cells was reassessed.
Extending previous findings (9), aphidicolin-induced NKG2DL
upregulation on NIH3T3 fibroblasts could be blocked by
shRNA-mediated knockdown of Chk1 or ATR, but not ATM
or Chk2 (Fig. 4C and D; see also Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, none of the shRNA constructs prevented aphidicolinmediated Clr-b downregulation on either NIH3T3 fibroblasts
or C1498 cells. In fact, ATR/Chk1 silencing (but not ATM/Chk2
silencing) modestly enhanced aphidicolin-mediated downregulation of Clr-b, and somewhat lowered constitutive Clr-b
expression, on NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4C and D).
Collectively, although redundancy in the DDR pathway
cannot be excluded, the failure of shRNA-mediated silencing
of these kinases to inhibit aphidicolin-mediated Clr-b downregulation (on both NIH3T3 and C1498 cells), suggests that
loss of Clr-b in response to genotoxic stress might occur
via a novel mechanism, independent of the ATR/ATM pathways (10). The lack of ATM involvement is further supported
by the failure of γ-irradiation and the radiomimetic drugs,
bleomycin and phleomycin, to promote Clr-b downregulation. In addition, studies using p53−/− MEF and inhibitors
of p53 function (such as pifithrin-α; ref. 34) failed to reveal
any involvement of p53 (a downstream effector of the
ATM/ATR-mediated DDR signaling pathways; ref. 35) on
stress-mediated Clr-b downregulation (data not shown). In
turn, the partial ability of caffeine to abrogate aphidicolinmediated Clr-b downregulation (on NIH3T3 but not C1498
cells) might be due to effects unrelated to the DDR pathway
(36), such as cell cycle blockade (31), or inhibition of PI3K,
DNA-PK, PAK1, or other caffeine-sensitive kinases (30, 32,
33, 37). To gain further insight, we examined Clr-b expression
at the transcript level.

Genotoxic stress-mediated loss of Clr-b occurs at the
transcript level
It was previously shown that Clr-b is rapidly lost at both
the transcript and surface protein levels in response to CMV
infection (21). However, it is not known whether Clr-b downregulation following genotoxic stress occurs at the transcript
level or whether the surface protein is being actively internalized. To address this question, Clr-b transcripts were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers spanning
the entire coding sequence. As shown in Fig. 5A, Clr-b transcripts were rapidly lost in C1498 cells undergoing genotoxic
stress. Moreover, the loss of Clr-b transcripts following stress

induction correlates temporally with the loss of Clr-b protein
at the cell surface (Fig. 1A, Fig. 5A), similar to previous
observations following CMV infection (21). Thus, like viral infection, genotoxic stress directly regulates steady-state levels
of endogenous Clr-b transcripts.
To investigate this further, the full-length Clr-b coding
sequence was ectopically overexpressed in C1498 cells under the control of a heterologous CMV promoter (pMCIG
vector; ref. 28), and then Clr-b surface levels were reassessed. As shown in Fig. 5B, stable overexpression of Clr-b
transcripts prevents downregulation of Clr-b surface protein

mediated by diverse agents. These data show that loss of
Clr-b in response to genotoxic stress, like that promoted
by transformation (16) or viral infection (21), is controlled
at the transcript level.
Notably, transcript level regulation has been previously reported for at least some NKG2DLs that are upregulated upon
transformation or genotoxic stress (10, 11). However, other
NKG2DLs (e.g., Mult1) were recently shown to be posttranslationally regulated in response to cell stress (10). Therefore,
we examined protein level regulation of Clr-b on cells exposed to genotoxic stress.

Cell Stress Promotes Missing-Self Recognition by NK Cells

Regulation of cell surface Clr-b protein following
genotoxic stress
Although Clr-b expression is regulated at the transcript
level, it is still possible that Clr-b surface protein might also
be posttranslationally internalized, either constitutively or
following genotoxic stress (10). Consistent with this possibility,
the Clr-b cytoplasmic tail contains a number of motifs that
could affect its cell surface expression, including several lysine
residues that may serve as substrates for ubiquitination (Supplementary Fig. S3). Indeed, several viruses have evolved E3
ubiquitin ligases that posttranslationally regulate cell surface
expression of MHC-I, B7 family members, ICAM-1, or NKG2DL
(38–41). A potential role for the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway in Clr-b downregulation following genotoxic
stress was investigated using MG132, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the 26S proteasome.
Interestingly, MG132 pretreatment abrogated Clr-b downregulation following treatment of C1498 cells with diverse agents,
including aphidicolin, cisplatin, roscovitine, trichostatin-A,
and UV-C irradiation, whereas MG132 treatment alone
slightly (but consistently) increased steady-state Clr-b surface expression (Fig. 6A; data not shown). Furthermore,
MG132 administration also blocked downregulation of
surface Clr-b in response to generalized inhibitors of transcription, translation, and posttranslational processing, such
as α-amanitin, actinomycin-D, cycloheximide, and tunicamycin
(Fig. 6B), the latter of which also promotes endoplasmic
reticulum-associated stress.
Because MG132 can exert pleiotropic effects independent
of blocking ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation,
including an ability to inhibit calpains and cathepsins, another proteasomal inhibitor of greater specificity, lactacystin,
was also used (42). As shown in Fig. 6C, both MG132 and
lactacystin prevented stress-mediated Clr-b downregulation
in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were observed
using NIH3T3 fibroblasts and MEF cells (data not shown).
Importantly, the administration of proteasomal inhibitors
had no influence on the downregulation of Clr-b transcripts
following administration of genotoxic agents or transcriptional inhibitors, as revealed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(Fig. 6D). This shows that downregulation of Clr-b transcripts can be uncoupled from a loss of Clr-b surface protein.
Nonetheless, the MG132 and lactacystin data do not necessarily implicate the proteasome itself in direct degradation
of Clr-b. Pharmacologic inhibition of the proteasome leads to
the accumulation of nondegraded polyubiquitinated aggregates and a rapid depletion of free ubiquitin levels, resulting
in general impairment of ubiquitin-dependent processes (43).
One such proteasome-independent process, the endolysosomal trafficking pathway, targets endocytosed monoubiquitinated proteins for recycling and/or lysosomal degradation
(44). Interestingly, chloroquine, an inhibitor of endolysosomal
acidification (45), also impaired aphidicolin- and cisplatinmediated Clr-b downregulation (data not shown). Collectively,
these results suggest that ubiquitin-dependent processes play
an important role in normal Clr-b cell surface turnover,
whereas stress-mediated Clr-b downregulation is ultimately
controlled at the transcript level. Therefore, any perturbation

www.aacrjournals.org

in Clr-b transcript levels might rapidly influence Clr-b surface
expression.

Discussion
It has been previously shown that stimulatory ligands for
the NKG2D and DNAM-1 immunoreceptors are upregulated by the DDR pathway following genotoxic stress, an
effect that enhances the susceptibility of target cells to
NK cell–mediated lysis (9, 15). Here, for the first time, we
show that genotoxic stress promotes the functional downregulation of an inhibitory NK ligand, Clr-b. The ability of
numerous distinct chemotherapeutic and genotoxic agents
to promote Clr-b downregulation suggests that cell stress
may initiate a conserved and programmed cellular response governing Clr-b expression. Thus, pathways governing the cellular response to transformation (16), genotoxic
stress (an initiating event in transformation), viral infection
(21), and other pathologic states might share common features (46, 47).
Similar to the findings reported here for Clr-b downregulation, cell surface expression of the NKG2DL, Mult1,
was upregulated independently of the ATR/ATM pathway
in response to cell stress induced by heat shock and UV
irradiation (10). Surface expression of Mult1 was shown
to be dependent on inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome
and endolysosomal degradation pathways responsible for
retention of the protein within normal, nonstressed cells.
These findings highlight a potentially conserved ubiquitindependent mechanism for Clr-b downregulation under
stressed versus nonstressed conditions.
How Clr-b transcript and surface protein levels might be
regulated requires further investigation. One possible
mechanism is via the direct control of Clrb (Clec2d) promoter activity and the production of nascent Clr-b transcripts. A second potential mechanism is through the
posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability. This intriguing possibility was recently suggested by the finding
that the rodent Clr-b mRNAs (i.e., the mouse Clec2d8
and rat Clec2d11 gene products; refs. 17, 21) possess an
embedded autocatalytic discontinuous hammerhead ribozyme sequence (48). Thus, cleavage of steady-state Clr-b
transcripts by the internal ribozyme upstream of the polyadenylation site could promote the loss of mRNA stability
or impair protein translation. Whether protein factors normally antagonize autocatalysis mediated by the ribozyme
sequence, or whether cofactors are recruited to the cleavage site upon genotoxic stress, requires further testing. On
the other hand, preexisting Clr-b transcripts may also be
regulated at the level of mRNA stability and/or protein
translation by microRNA-mediated silencing mechanisms,
such as that observed for NKG2DL expression (49, 50).
Thus, Clec2d promoter activity, elements within the Clr-b
untranslated regions, and endogenous or pathogen-encoded
Clr-b–specific microRNAs are all relevant targets to warrant
future studies on the missing-self control of Clr-b expression
in response to pathologic processes (16, 17, 21).

In conclusion, how NK cells recognize abnormal targets
remains incompletely understood. Understanding how a
programmed cellular response mediates Clr-b downregulation in real time during genotoxic stress will enhance our
knowledge of the events that lead to innate recognition of
transformed and infected cells, how malignant NK-resistant
tumors evolve, and how chemotherapeutic agents might
influence NK recognition of normal and tumor cells. Future
insight into this MHC-independent mode of missing-self
ligand modulation will affect our views of NK cell–mediated
recognition.
