Abstract
PM02734 is a novel synthetic antitumor drug that is currently
in phase I clinical trials. To gain some insight into its mode of
action, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model
system. Treatment of S. cerevisiae with PM02734 rapidly
induced necrosis-like cell death, as also found for mammalian
cells treated with its close analogue kahalalide F. We have
screened the complete set of 4,848 viable S. cerevisiae haploid
deletion mutants to identify genes involved in sensitivity or
resistance to PM02734. Forty-five percent of the 40 most
sensitive strains identified had a role in intracellular vesicle
trafficking, indicating that the drug severely affects this
process. A mutant strain lacking the sphingolipid fatty acyl
2-hydroxylase Scs7 was found to be the most resistant to
PM02734, whereas overexpression of Scs7 rendered the cells
hypersensitive to PM02734. To validate these findings in
human cells, we did small interfering RNA experiments and
also overexpressed the Scs7 human homologue FA2H in
human cancer cell lines. As in yeast, FA2H silencing turned
the cells resistant to the drug, whereas FA2H overexpression
led to an increased sensitivity. Moreover, exogenous addition
of the 2-hydroxylated fatty acid 2-hydroxy palmitic acid to
different human cell lines increased their sensitivity to the
cytotoxic compound. Taken together, these results suggest that
the cell membrane and, in particular, 2-hydroxy fatty acid–
containing ceramides are important for PM02734 activity.
These findings may have important implications in the
development of PM02734 because tumor cells with high
FA2H expression are expected to be particularly sensitive to
this drug. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9779–87]

Introduction
PM02734 is a synthetic cyclic depsipeptide related to natural
kahalalides, especially to kahalalide F (KF), an antitumor
compound isolated from the Hawaiian mollusk Elysia rufescens
(1, 2). PM02734 has shown in vitro activity against a broad
spectrum of tumor types: breast, colon, pancreas, lung, prostate,
etc. In addition, PM02734 shows statistically significant in vivo
antitumor activity in several human cancer cell lines xenografted

into mice. Based on these observations, and in view of its
acceptable nonclinical toxicity profile, PM02734 has been selected
for clinical development (2).
Although PM02734 has entered phase I clinical trials with a
positive therapeutic index in advanced pretreated solid tumors,
very little is known about its mechanism of action. To gain insight
into the in vivo mechanism of the action of PM02734, we used the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. We found that
the compound induces rapid necrosis-like cell death in yeast. We
also provide evidence that PM02734 affects vesicle trafficking and
mitochondrial functions because mutants affected in these
processes were highly sensitive to the drug. Furthermore, we have
identified the scs7 mutant as the most resistant strain to the
cytotoxic action of PM02734. Moreover, increased levels of Scs7
turned the cells hypersensitive to the compound. These results
have been validated in human cells. Scs7 and its human
homologue, FA2H, are hydroxylases that introduce a hydroxyl
group at the position 2 of fatty acids. 2-Hydroxy fatty acids are
found almost exclusively as N-acyl chains within the ceramide
moiety of a variety of sphingolipids. The functional role of fatty acid
2-hydroxylation has not been clearly established, but it seems
to affect membrane conformation (3). We have found that
2-hydroxylated fatty acid–containing ceramides are involved in
the mechanism of action of PM02734. The implications of all these
findings in the treatment of tumors with PM02734 and patient
selection are discussed.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. PM02734 was obtained from PharmaMar, prepared as a 10
mg/mL stock solution in DMSO/ethanol (1:1), and kept at 20jC. The drug
concentrations used for the experiments were in the range of those
obtained after clinical administration of the compound. Syringomycin E was
also supplied by PharmaMar and was dissolved in DMSO at 5 mg/mL. MMS
was supplied by Fluka and SDS was obtained from Sigma.
Yeast strains and media. The 4,848 S. cerevisiae haploid deletion
mutants in nonessential genes were obtained from Invitrogen. Yeast strains
were grown at 30jC on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) with geneticin
(G418, Duchefa) or without geneticin when growing the wild-type strain.
Electron microscopy. Cells (2  108) were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde
for 1 h at room temperature and processed as described by Wonisch et al.
(4). Finally, cells were resuspended in 500 AL of 100% Spurr resin and
transferred to capsules where resin polymerized for 20 h at 60jC. Ultrathin
sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined in
a transmission electron microscope.
Identification of yeast strains hypersensitive or resistant to
PM02734. Deletion strains were grown in YPD with G418 at 200 Ag/mL.
Cells were resuspended and inoculated in YPD with 250 Ag/mL PM02734.
Resistant strains were identified as those with a higher absorbance after
24 h of growth. Sensitive strains were unable to grow after 48 h. Strains
hypersensitive or resistant to PM02734 were isolated to new plates to

determine their drug tolerance phenotype more accurately using different
concentrations of the drug.
Overexpression of SCS7 in S. cerevisiae. Full-length SCS7 gene was
placed under control of the GAL1 promoter using a PCR-based method (5).
A PCR fragment containing 49 nucleotides 142 bp upstream of the SCS7
start codon together with the KanMX6 module and 50 nucleotides ending
just downstream the start codon was amplified using the pair of
oligonucleotides scs7-F4 (5¶-AACGGGGTTTTGCGCGGATTTACTGACGTGTGACATCTTTTCGCAGTTAAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3¶)
and scs7-R2 (5¶-GTACCGTCTTTTTTGAAAACAGTTCCAAAGTCTTGGAAGTATTAGTCGACATTTTGAGATCCGGGTTTT-3¶). Plasmid pFA6a-KanMX6PGAL was used as template. S. cerevisiae BY4741 wild-type strain was
transformed with the PCR fragment and selected in medium containing
G418. Correct integration in the yeast chromosome was verified by PCR.
Cell cultures. HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium
(Invitrogen). U937 and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640. Media were
supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100
Ag/mL streptomycin. Cells were maintained under humid conditions of 5%
CO2 at 37jC.
Overexpression experiments. HCT116 cells were transiently transfected
with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FA2H (6) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Briefly, plasmid/Lipofectamine 2000 complexes (0.5 Ag/1.5 AL per well) were
prepared in 100 AL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) and
distributed in 24-well plates. HCT116 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in normal growth medium to 2.5  105/mL. Five hundred
microliters were then added to each well. For the generation of stable cell
lines, HCT116 or HeLa cells were transfected as above and then subjected to
G418 selection (400 or 500 Ag/mL for HCT116 or HeLa). Single colonies were
isolated and analyzed for FA2H expression by Western blot.
Incubation of cells with fatty acids. Cells were incubated with several
concentrations of fatty acids (either 2-hydroxylated or not) for 24 h and then
washed, placed in serum-free medium, and incubated with different
concentrations of PM02734 for an additional 24 h. Cell viability was
assessed by the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation
Assay, as described below.
To determine the incorporation of 2-hydroxy fatty acids into lipid
species, the cells were labeled with 0.1 ACi/mL 2-hydroxy [1-14C]palmitic
acid (specific activity, 50–60 mCi/mmol; American Radiochemicals, Inc.) for
24 h. As a positive control, the cells were incubated with 0.1 ACi/mL
[1-14C]oleic acid (Amersham). Then, lipids were extracted according to the
method of Bligh and Dyer (7) and separated by TLC using three different
mobile phases: (a) diethyl ether/petroleum ether/acetic acid (50:50:1; to
separate 2-hydroxy fatty acids from nonhydroxylated fatty acids; ref. 8), (b)
n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1; to separate polar lipids from
nonpolar lipids; ref. 9), and (c) chloroform/formic acid (95:5; to separate
ceramides from glycerophospholipids; ref. 10). Radioactivity in the plates
was visualized by autoradiography. The position of the different radioactive
spots was compared with that of commercial standards.
Small interfering RNA knockdown experiments. HCT116 cells were
transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides using
Lipofectamine 2000 and following the recommendations of the Silencer
siRNA Starter kit (Ambion). Briefly, siRNA/Lipofectamine 2000 complexes
were dispensed in 24-well plates and then mixed with 5  104 cells per well.
Three different siRNAs (Ambion) against FA2H were tested for the
reduction of mRNA levels 24, 48, or 72 h after transfection. The most
effective was 5¶-CCACGGUUCAAAGUGGUGGTT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CCACCACUUUGAACCGUGGTT-3¶ (antisense) at 30 nmol/L 48 h after transfection.
Protein extracts and Western blots. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 or
pcDNA3-FA2H or stable clones were washed twice with PBS and lysed with
100 AL of lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%
SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 25 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]. Protein
concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay
kit (Pierce). For FA2H detection, 30 Ag of total protein extract were run on a
10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antihuman FA2H antibodies (1:1,000; ref. 6) for 2 h at room temperature.
Horseradish peroxidase–linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were used
as secondary antibodies at 1:2,000 dilution. Inmunoblots were incubated for

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

1 h at room temperature and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham). For caspase-3 and
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) detection, 30 Ag of protein from
HCT116 or U937 cells were used. Anti-caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) and anti-PARP antibody (Sigma) were used at 1:1,000 and
1:2,000, respectively.
Cell viability assays. Determination of cell viability was carried out
following the recommendations of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous NonRadioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega Biotech Iberica). Cells seeded
in 24-well plates at the indicated concentration in the overexpression or
siRNA experiments were treated with different concentrations of cytotoxic
compounds. To determine viability, 100 AL of a combined 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt/phenazine methosulfate solution were added to each well
containing 500 AL of culture medium. After 3 h of incubation, the formation
of the formazan product was assayed by measuring absorbance at 490 nm
in a 24-well plate reader (Tecan Ultra Evolution).
RNA extraction and Northern blots. Total RNA from cells was obtained
following the recommendations of the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Five
micrograms of each sample were separated on a agarose formaldehyde gel
and Northern blotting was carried out following the protocol of the
ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (BD Biosciences). The FA2H cDNA
probe was an 862-bp fragment obtained by PCR using the plasmid pcDNA3FA2H as template (6) and the oligonucleotides FA2H-5 (5¶-GCAGGGCTCCATGGAGAACGAGCCTGTAGC-3¶) and FA2H-3 (5¶-TGGGAGTTGTCACTGCGTCTTCAGGTGGGG-3¶). Probes were labeled with [a-32P]dCTP
using the Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System kit (Amersham).

Results
PM02734 inhibits cell growth in budding yeast. To analyze
whether PM02734 affected the growth of S. cerevisiae cells, we
constructed growth curves using different concentrations of the
drug (Fig. 1A, left). The minimum concentration of PM02734
observed to completely inhibit cell growth over at least 24 hours
was 250 Ag/mL (157 Amol/L). To determine whether the effect of
PM02734 in yeast cells was cytostatic or cytotoxic, a survival test
after incubation with several concentrations of PM02734 was done
(Fig. 1A, right). Viability declined with increasing concentrations of
PM02734, indicating that the compound was cytotoxic to yeast
cells.
PM02734 rapidly induces necrosis in yeast cells. Following
lethal injury, two modes of cell death can be distinguished in
mammalian cells: apoptosis and oncosis, or primary necrosis (11).
During the development of oncosis, membrane integrity is lost and
cells become permeable, first to small molecules such as propidium
iodide (PI) and then to larger molecules such as high-molecular
weight dextrans (12). To test whether PM02734 permeabilized yeast
to PI, we treated cells with concentrations of PM02734 ranging
from 50 to 350 Ag/mL and then did PI treatment. Flow cytometry
analysis revealed that PM02734 permeabilized cells to PI because a
population of PI-positive cells appeared (Fig. 1B). PM02734dependent PI permeation was found to be very quick (PI-positive
cells appeared after 1 hour of PM02734 treatment) and concentration dependent. The percentage of PI-positive cells did not increase
after incubation times longer than 5 hours. PI-positive cells
corresponded to dead cells, as shown by methylene blue staining
(Fig. 1C, dark cells). In summary, PM02734-induced cell death
results in the uptake of methylene blue and PI, suggesting that the
cells become metabolically inactive and lose their integrity, which
is different from mammalian apoptosis and yeast apoptosis-like
cell death, in which only cell viability is lost (13). Different studies
carried out with the PM02734 analogue, KF, have indicated that the
compound induces cell death with no markers of apoptosis but

clear features of oncosis (14–16). One of the signature events of cell
death by apoptosis is the activation of a cascade of proteolytic
enzymes, the so-called caspases, which are synthesized as
zymogens (procaspases) and undergo proteolytic maturation. To
examine the features of PM02734-induced HCT116 cell death,
analysis of procaspase-3 and its active fragment was studied by
immunoblot. Figure 1D shows that treating the cells with PM02734
did not induce cleavage of caspase-3. As a control of these
experiments, we used cells exposed to 25 Amol/L bromoenol
lactone, a compound that induces apoptosis in a variety of cells by
interfering with membrane phospholipid metabolism (17, 18), and

caspase-3 active fragments were readily detected (Fig. 1D, left).
These data suggest that PM02734-induced HCT116 cell death is not
of the apoptotic type. To confirm this, cleavage of the caspase-3
substrate PARP was studied as well. The digestion fragment of 85
kDa only appeared in the positive controls but not in PM02734treated cells.
PM02734 causes invaginations of the plasma membrane.
To gain further insight into the alterations caused by PM02734 in
S. cerevisiae cells, we did electron microscopy studies (Fig. 2).
Untreated cells displayed a large nucleus, one or more large
vacuoles, and an intact membrane system (Fig. 2A). Surviving cells

exposed to PM02734 exhibited the same characteristics as
untreated cells (Fig. 2B, left). In contrast, cells killed by the action
of PM02734 showed extensive cell disorganization and most
intracellular structures were destroyed, which is characteristic of
necrotic cells. The most remarkable effect of PM02734 in yeast cells
was seen at the level of the plasma membrane, where we observed
several membrane invaginations (Fig. 2B–E, arrows). Multiple
membrane vesicles were also observed inside PM02734-treated
cells (Fig. 2C–E).
Screening for PM02734-hypersensitive deletion mutants.
We did a genome-wide PM02734 sensitivity screening by replica
plating the 4,848 deletion mutants into 96-well plates containing
250 Ag/mL PM02734. By doing so, we identified 199 mutants that
were hypersensitive to the compound (Supplementary Table S1;
detailed information about the screening is supplied in Supplementary Data). Supplementary Table S2 shows the top 40 most
sensitive strains to PM02734. When we analyzed the whole list of
199 hypersensitive strains (Supplementary Table S1), we found a
total of 39 genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport, of which
25 were specifically involved in Golgi trafficking (underlined). We
also found some other functional groups. One of them was formed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

by genes that participate in mitochondrial functions, including
ATP5, ATP7, ATP4, or ATP15, which are involved in ATP
biosynthesis, and COQ9, CAT5, and COQ4, with a role in the
biosynthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q). Another functional
group included the following genes playing a role in cell wall
biosynthesis: FLC2, CWH41, CCW12, ROT2, HOC1, CHS1, ALG6,
YUR1, SKT5, and OST3. Finally, a group of genes participating in
sphingolipid biosynthesis was found: CSG2 (this mutant was
already found in the top 40), FEN2, SUR2, SUR1, or BST1.
Identification of PM02734-resistant mutants. To identify
strains resistant to PM02734, the whole collection of deletion
mutants was grown in the presence of 250 Ag/mL PM02734 for 24
hours (detailed information about this screening is supplied in
Supplementary Data). Supplementary Table S3 shows the top 20
most resistant strains to PM02734. In contrast to the sensitive
strains, these 20 mutants were not grouped in functional categories
by the Gene Ontology Term Finder tool. To determine their degree
of resistance more accurately, mutants in genes that presented a
clear human ortholog (tcb3, scs7, ste24, and ygr054w) were grown in
rich medium, in the presence or absence of 250 Ag/mL PM02734,
and growth curves were obtained (Fig. 3). We found that scs7 was

the strain most resistant to PM02734 because it exhibited the
lowest degree of growth inhibition. tcb3 was also found to be highly
resistant, whereas ste24 and ygr054w were found to be only slightly
resistant to the compound.
SCS7 encodes a sphingolipid fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, located in
the endoplasmic reticulum, which introduces an a-OH into the
characteristic very long chain fatty acids of yeast sphingolipids
(19, 20). Scs7 is a well-conserved protein and FA2H has been
identified as its human ortholog (6). tcb3 belongs to the yeast
family of tricalbins. Tricalbins are thought to be the yeast orthologs
of mammalian synaptotagmins (21), a family with at least 14
mammalian variants involved in membrane-trafficking events (22).
The high level of resistance of the scs7 mutant to PM02734,
together with its putative role in defining membrane conformation
(3) and its high conservation in mammalian cells (FA2H),
prompted us to focus on Scs7/FA2H as a putative target of
PM02734.
Sensitivity of S. cerevisiae cells to PM02734 depends on Scs7
levels. Because SCS7 deletion led to resistance to PM02734 in S.
cerevisiae cells, we hypothesized that overproduction of Scs7 could
lead to hypersensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we first

constructed a S. cerevisiae strain in which the SCS7 gene was
placed under the control of a regulatable GAL1 promoter. This
promoter is repressed by glucose and induced in the presence of
galactose (23). Scs7 overexpression resulted in increased sensitivity
to PM02734, as revealed by spot assays (Fig. 4, YPGal panel),
whereas repression of Scs7 resulted in resistance to the drug, like
the scs7 mutant (Fig. 4, YPGlc panel). These cells were found to be
resistant to PM02734 and impermeable to PI after treatment with
the compound (data not shown). The drugs syringomycin E, MMS,
and SDS were used as controls. Syringomycin E is an antifungal
cyclic lipodepsinonapeptide produced by Pseudomonas syringae
(24). Interestingly, the scs7 mutant has also been found to be
resistant to this compound (3). As expected, PGALSCS7 cells grown
on glucose behaved like the scs7 mutant in terms of resistance to
syringomycin E (Fig. 4, YPGlc panel) and Scs7 overexpression
slightly increased the sensitivity of the cells to syringomycin E
(Fig. 4, YPGal panel). As controls, we used MMS, a DNA alkylating
agent, and SDS, a detergent that causes the cell membrane to break
down. As shown in Fig. 4, cells lacking or overexpresing Scs7
behaved as the wild-type in terms of sensitivity to both MMS and
SDS. These results indicated that levels of Scs7-mediated lipid
hydroxylation specifically affect the sensitivity of the cells to
syringomycin E and PM02734.
Overexpression of FA2H increases the sensitivity of mammalian cells to PM02734. To validate the results found in yeast in
human cells, we decided to look at the effect of FA2H overexpression and FA2H knockdown on the sensitivity of mammalian
cells to PM02734. It has previously been shown that COS7 cells
transfected with pcDNA3-FA2H contain higher levels of 2hydroxyceramides and 2-hydroxy fatty acids compared with
control cells, which indeed shows that the FA2H gene encodes a
fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (6). Transient overexpression of FA2H in
HCT116 cells leads to an increased sensitivity to PM02734 but has
no effect on sensitivity to the alkylating agent MMS nor to
syringomycin E (see Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similar results were
obtained in two additional mammalian cell lines: COS1 and
embryonic A293T (data not shown).
To examine in more detail the effect of FA2H overexpression on
the sensitivity of human cells to PM02734, we generated stable
clones overexpressing FA2H not only in HCT116 cells but also in
HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Clones overexpressing FA2H were identified by
Western blot (Fig. 5A) and examined for sensitivity to PM02734. As

Figure 4. Sensitivity of S. cerevisiae strains to different drugs. The SCS7 gene was placed under control of the regulatable GAL1 promoter. In the presence of
galactose (YPGal ), the promoter is on and PGALSCS7 cells express high levels of Scs7. When cells are grown in glucose, the promoter is off and the PGALSCS7
strain behaves like the scs7 null mutant. WT, PGALSCS7, or scs7D cells were grown in rich medium with either glucose or galactose. Five microliters of 4  106 cells/
mL and 1:10 serial dilutions were spotted onto plates containing either YPGal or YPGlc.

shown in Fig. 5B, these clones were clearly more sensitive to the
drug in both cell lines. Microscopic examination of these cells after
1 hour of treatment showed a swollen phenotype also reported for
cells treated with the PM02734 analogue KF (15, 16, 25). In
conclusion, these experiments indicate that overexpression of
FA2H highly increases the sensitivity of mammalian cells to
PM02734.
Exogenous addition of 2-hydroxy fatty acids increases the
sensitivity of mammalian cells to PM02734. In view of the
results obtained in the overexpression experiments, we decided to
investigate whether increasing the cellular levels of 2-hydroxylated
lipids, by incubating different cell lines (HCT116, U937, and HeLa)
with exogenous 2-hydroxylated fatty acids, would result in an
enhanced sensitivity to PM02734. Exogenous addition of fatty acids
(2-hydroxylated or not) up to 50 Amol/L did not compromise cell
viability even in the absence of serum (data not shown). HCT116
cells that had been incubated in the presence of 2-hydroxy palmitic
acid showed a marked increase in their sensitivity to PM02734
compared with cells incubated with palmitic acid or without any
fatty acid (Fig. 5D, left). This effect was specific for PM02734
because the addition of 2-hydroxy palmitic acid did not change the
sensitivity to MMS. Similar results were obtained with HeLa and
U937 (data not shown).
To study the metabolic fate of 2-hydroxy palmitic acid in the
cells, 14C-labeled fatty acid was used and the different lipid
products into which the fatty acid could potentially incorporated
were separated by TLC. Interestingly, 2-hydroxy palmitate incorporated almost exclusively into the ceramide fraction in the three
cell lines used. Results with HCT116 cells are shown (Fig. 5D, right).
Essentially no 2-hydroxy palmitic acid remained in the cell as free
fatty acid or bound to phospholipid. This distribution strongly
contrasts with that of a nonhydroxylated fatty acid, such as
palmitic or oleic acid, where, as expected, most of the label
appeared in the phospholipid and triacylglycerol fractions. These
results indicate that cell membranes with an increased pool of
2-hydroxy fatty acid in ceramides are more sensitive to PM02734.
Knockdown of FA2H increases the resistance of HCT116 cells
to PM02734. To address whether FA2H depletion had an effect on
the sensitivity of the cells to PM02734, we did RNA interference
experiments. Three different siRNAs were tested for a reduction in
FA2H mRNA levels at 24, 48, or 72 hours after transfection. Northern
blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in FA2H mRNA after
48 hours in FA2H siRNA treated with one of the tested oligos versus
the nontargeting control siRNA (data not shown). HCT116 cells
transfected with this siRNA were assayed for sensitivity to PM02734,
MMS, or syringomycin E (Fig. 6A and B) and analyzed by Northern
blot (Fig. 6C). Survival assays showed that FA2H knockdown
significantly increased the resistance to PM02734 (Fig. 6A). This
effect was only observed for PM02734 because treatment with MMS
or syringomycin E did not affect HCT116 sensitivity to these drugs.
Figure 6B shows that cells transfected with control siRNA cells were
completely swollen when treated with a high dose (7 Amol/L) of
PM02734 for 1 hour. In contrast, the majority of the cells transfected
with FA2H siRNA had the same appearance as the untreated cells,
which visually confirmed that depletion of FA2H results in increased
resistance to PM02734.

Discussion
In the present study, we took advantage of the cell biology and
genetics of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae to clarify the mechanism

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

of action of the antitumor drug PM02734. Here, we report that
PM02734 induces a rapid necrosis-like cell death in S. cerevisiae
and HCT116 cells, as also found for other human cell lines treated
with the closest PM02734 analogue, KF. Yeast cells were found to be
sensitive to PM02734 at concentrations much higher than human
cells. This difference might be due to the presence of the yeast cell
wall because some of the mutant strains hypersensitive to PM02734
were deleted in genes involved in cell wall organization and
biogenesis.
The alterations caused by the PM02734 analogue, KF, in human
cells (cytoplasmic swelling, vesiculation of cytoplasmic organelles,
vacuolization, and mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum
damage) prompted Suarez et al. (15) to suggest that the compound
induces changes in the osmotic balance of the cell. Accordingly, the
mechanism of action of KF has been postulated to be similar to
those of other cytotoxic peptides, which induce cell death through
the formation of new ion channels in the membrane and/or by
changing the activity of existing channels (14, 26). In particular,
Garcia-Rocha et al. (25) suggested that KF may act similarly to
monensin, a Na+/H+ ionophore produced by Streptomyces cinnamonensis. This compound slows down intracellular transport,
principally within the Golgi complex (27, 28). We found that 39 of
the top 199 strains most sensitive to PM02734 were deleted in
genes involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, 25 of them in
vesicle targeting to, from, or within the Golgi apparatus. These
results strongly indicate that PM02734 also affects intracellular
transport in yeast and that it might cause damage to the Golgi
compartment, as also found for monensin. However, other
organelles, such as mitochondria, may also be subject to the effect
of PM02734 treatment because mutants in genes exerting a role in
mitochondrial functions were also found to be hypersensitive to
PM02734. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been associated with
cancer, and drugs targeting mitochondria have been suggested to
be important to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (29). If PM02734
does affect mitochondria in human cells, this might explain, at
least in part, its higher effectiveness in cancer cells because the
rapid and continuous growth of tumor cells is highly energy
dependent.
Interestingly, many of the yeast genes identified that participate
in intracellular transport are highly conserved in humans (see
Supplementary Data). Some of them, such as AP3D1 or SYNJ2, are
expressed at low levels in certain tumors (30, 31). It will be very
interesting to analyze whether lowering the levels of the
corresponding genes in human cells leads to increased sensitivity
to PM02734, as found in yeast. If this turns out to be the case, the
prediction will be that tumors expressing low levels of these
proteins will show a good response to PM02734 treatment.
Although PM02734 could interact with the lipid bilayer, it is
unlikely to form pores by itself because the molecule is too small
to directly span the lipid bilayer. A minimum of 20 amino acids is
required for this action (26) and PM02734 is formed by only 14
amino acids. One possibility is that PM02734 forms multimers. It
is also possible that the drug interferes with some component of
the membrane, resulting in the formation, or modification, of ion
channels. It is known that the composition of the phospholipid
bilayer strongly influences the formation of channels by other
cytotoxic peptides (26). In the present work, we have shown that
sensitivity to PM02734 both in yeast and humans largely depends
on the levels of Scs7/FA2H-mediated fatty acid hydroxylation. A
role for FA2H in membrane conformation has been suggested
based on the observation that 2-hydroxylation participates in

Figure 6. Increased resistance to PM02734 by FA2H knockdown. HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with a siRNA against FA2H or with a nontargeting control
siRNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium was replaced by fresh medium, and 48 h after transfection, cells were assayed for sensitivity to different drugs.

intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding (32, 33).
Interestingly, it has previously been shown that sensitivity to
another cyclic peptide, the pore-forming antifungal agent
syringomycin E, also depends on the presence of fatty acid
2-hydroxylation because the scs7 mutant was also found to be
resistant to this drug (3). One hypothesis, proposed by Hama
et al. (3), is that 2-hydroxylation would enhance the formation of
sterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), which
may serve as sites for syringomycin E binding and channel
formation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that mutants
in other genes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis are also
resistant to the compound. However, this is not the case for
PM02734. We found that mutants in sphingolipid biosynthesis
were hypersensitive to the compound, indicating that disruption
of lipid rafts by the depletion of sphingolipids does not lead
to resistance but to hypersensitivity to PM02734. In other words,
lipid rafts may constitute a barrier to the action of PM02734 and
not a platform for its action. Another difference between
syringomycin E and PM02734 is that the levels of FA2H-mediated
sphingolipid fatty acid 2-hydroxylation did not affect the
sensitivity of human cells to syringomycin E. Based on our
results, we propose one of the two following scenarios to explain

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

the mechanism of action of PM02734: (a) fatty acid 2hydroxylation allows PM02734 hydrogen bonding directly to
sphingolipids to facilitate ion channel formation or permeability
to the drug and (b) 2-hydroxylation influences the formation
of some kind of membrane microdomain, not necessarily lipid
rafts, present in the lipid bilayer that is important for drugmembrane association. In this regard, we have shown that
PM02734 induces the formation of plasma membrane invaginations in yeast (Fig. 2). These structures may represent the
theoretical microdomains.
Our results highlight the importance of the study of 2hydroxylation in membrane conformation. The role of FA2H has
only been investigated in the brain, where FA2H is a myelinationassociated gene (34), and in the skin, where it participates in the
formation and function of epidermal permeability barrier (35).
Sphingolipids containing 2-hydroxy fatty acids are uniquely
abundant in the brain, skin, intestinal tract, and certain cancers
(36). Our results may have important implications in PM02734
therapy because tumor cells with high levels of sphingolipid fatty
acid 2-hydroxylation are expected to be highly sensitive to this
drug. FA2H could then become a marker of PM02734 activity and
help guide patient selection.
