Abstract
Oncogenic mutations in Kras occur in 40% to 45% of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). We have
previously shown that chemotherapy acutely activates ADAM17, resulting in growth factor shedding, growth
factor receptor activation, and drug resistance in CRC tumors. In this study, we examined the role of mutant Kras
in regulating growth factor shedding and ADAM17 activity, using isogenic Kras mutant (MT) and wild-type (WT)
HCT116 CRC cells. Significantly higher levels of TGF-a and VEGF were shed from KrasMT HCT116 cells, both
basally and following chemotherapy treatment, and this correlated with increased pErk (phosphorylated
extracellular signal regulated kinase)1/2 levels and ADAM17 activity. Inhibition of Kras, MEK (MAP/ERK
kinase)1/2, or Erk1/2 inhibition abrogated chemotherapy-induced ADAM17 activity and TGF-a shedding.
Moreover, we found that these effects were not drug or cell line specific. In addition, MEK1/2 inhibition in
KrasMT xenografts resulted in significant decreases in ADAM17 activity and growth factor shedding in vivo,
which correlated with dramatically attenuated tumor growth. Furthermore, we found that MEK1/2 inhibition
significantly induced apoptosis both alone and when combined with chemotherapy in KrasMT cells. Importantly, we found that sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition was ADAM17 dependent in vitro and in vivo. Collectively,
our findings indicate that oncogenic Kras regulates ADAM17 activity and thereby growth factor ligand shedding
in a MEK1/2/Erk1/2-dependent manner and that KrasMT CRC tumors are vulnerable to MEK1/2 inhibitors, at
least in part, due to their dependency on ADAM17 activity. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1071–80. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Ras GTPases act as critical "on-off" switches in cellular
growth and survival (1). Ras is activated by several receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) and is regulated by guanine nucleotide
releasing factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP).
Active GTP-bound Ras interacts with a range of effectors to
activate multiple downstream pathways, most notably the
Raf/MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) and PI-3 kinase
pathways (1, 2). The Ras subfamily consists of 3 proto-oncogenes: c-Harvey (H)-ras, c-Kirsten (K)-ras, and c-Neuroblastoma
(N)-ras (3). Ras genes become oncogenic by single point
mutations, mainly in codons 12 or 13, which alter the guanine
nucleotide–binding region, rendering Ras unresponsive to

GAPs and resulting in constitutive activation of Ras and
aberrant downstream signaling.
Somatic ras mutations most frequently occur in Kras and
arise in approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers (4), 30% of
lung cancers (5) and 40% to 45% of colorectal cancers (CRC;
ref. 6). Kras and Braf mutations have recently been linked with
resistance to anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)
monoclonal antibodies in advanced CRC (7–9). The development of drugs that inhibit oncogenic Kras in this patient group
is therefore of the utmost importance. We have shown previously that chemotherapy acutely activates the protease
ADAM17 (a desintegrin and metalloproteinase 17), which
results in growth factor shedding, growth factor receptor
(GFR) activation, and drug resistance in CRC tumors (10).
In this study, we investigated the role of Kras in regulating
ADAM17 activity and growth factor shedding. We also investigated the mechanism by which mutant Kras triggers growth
factor shedding, in particular, the role of MAPKs in regulating
this survival response.

Cantabria, Spain) and Atanasio Pandiella (University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain), respectively (11).
Cell culture
All CRC cells were grown as previously described (10).
Following receipt, cells were grown up, and as soon as surplus
cells became available, they were frozen as a seed stock. All cells
were passaged for a maximum of 2 months, after which new
seed stocks were thawed for experimental use. All cell lines
were tested for mycoplasma contamination at least every
month. WiDR (2009)/LS174T (2008)/SW620 (2008)/RKO
(2001)/HT-29 (2001)/CACO-2 (2005) cells were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC; authentication
by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling/karyotyping/isoenzyme analysis] and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM). LoVo (2004) cells were obtained from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC; authentication
by isoenzyme analysis/multilocus DNA fingerprinting/Multiplex PCR) and maintained in DMEM. HCC2998 cells were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer
DCT Tumour Repository [October 2008; authentication by SNP
arrays, oligonucleotide-base HLA typing, karyotyping, and STR
(May 2007)] and maintained in RPMI 1640. LIM2405 cell line,
established in 1992 (12), was a gift from Dr. Whitehead (Ludwig
Institute of Melbourne and Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN) and was grown in RPMI. This cell line was tested for
morphology/growth rate/response to mitogens/xenograft
growth/expression of brush-border and mucin-related antigens/mutational analysis (12, 13). HCT116, HKH-2, and HKe-3
CRC cells, provided by Senji Shirasawa in August 2008, were
maintained in DMEM and properties of these cells—morphology/soft agar cloning efficiency/tumorigenicity/c-myc expression (14), apical-basal cell polarity/proliferation in 2- and 3dimensional cultures, gene expression profiles (15), ras synthetic lethal interaction (16), and response to mTOR inhibitors
(17)—were published. We confirmed their Kras mutational
status by pyrosequencing and sequencing (April 2010).
In vivo studies
In vivo studies were conducted as previously described (10).
Mice received vehicle (methocel/polysorbate buffer) or
AZD6244 25 mg/kg/bid p.o. Each treatment group contained
10 animals.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability assays were done as previously described (18).
IC50 was calculated using Prism software package. Representative results of at least 3 independent experiments are shown.
Flow cytometric analysis and cell death measurement
Flow cytometry was done as previously described (18).
Representative results of at least 3 independent experiments
are shown.

mouse monoclonal antibodies were used in conjunction with
a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Amersham). Anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-Akt
(Ser473; Cell Signaling), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling), anti-Erk1/

kinase)1/2 (Cell Signaling), and anti-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling)
rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used in conjunction with an
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham).
Equal loading was assessed using b-tubulin (Sigma), b-actin
(Sigma), or GAPDH (Biogenesis) mouse monoclonal primary
antibodies.
siRNA transfections
Kras, Erk, and SC (scramble control) siRNAs were obtained
from Dharmacon. siRNA transfections were done as previously described (18).
ELISA and ADAM17 activity
VEGF and TGF-a ELISA and ADAM17 activity assay was
carried out as previously described (10, 18).
Statistical analysis
Two-way ANOVA test was used to determine the significance of change in levels of apoptosis between different
treatment groups. All changes in levels of apoptosis that
are described as significant had P < 0.05 values (*,P < 0.05;
**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001). The nature of the interaction
between AZD6244 and chemotherapy was determined by
calculating the combination index (CI) according to the
method of Chou and Talalay (19).

Results
An activating mutation in Kras results in increased
ADAM17 activity and ligand shedding in CRC cells
To investigate the role of Kras mutations in regulating basal
and chemotherapy-induced growth factor shedding, we used
the HCT116 CRC cell line, which carries an endogenous
activating KrasG13D point mutation and an isogenic HKH2 clone with a disrupted KrasG13D allele (Fig. 1A, top; ref. 14).
KrasMT HCT116 cells were significantly more resistant to the
HER1 inhibitor gefitinib and the dual HER1/HER2 inhibitor
M880588, with the IC50 doses at 72 hours approximately 5 and
7.5 times higher, respectively, than in the KrasWT cell line
(Supplementary Table S1). In addition, treatment with gefitinib, M880588, and the clinically used EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab resulted in significantly increased levels of
apoptosis in the HKH-2 cell line compared with the HCT116
cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1, left). Similar results were
obtained in the HKe-3 cell line, a second HCT116-derived cell
line containing KrasWT (Supplementary Fig. S1, right). Given
the clinically established role of Kras mutations in determining sensitivity to HER-targeted therapies (7, 8), these results
indicate that the cell lines are a clinically relevant model
system.

Notably, we found significantly higher basal levels of TGFa (18-fold higher) and VEGF (3-fold higher) in the culture
medium of HCT116 cells than in the KrasWT isogenic
cell line (Fig. 1A, bottom). Moreover, when HCT116 and
HKH-2 cells were treated with 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) for 12
hours, a significant increase in TGF-a and VEGF shedding
was observed in the HCT116 cell line but not in the HKH-2
cells (Fig. 1A). As we have previously shown that ADAM17
regulates not only TGF-a shedding but also VEGF shedding
following chemotherapy treatment (10), we next directly
investigated the effect of mutant Kras in regulating ADAM17
activity in the KrasMT/KrasWT paired model (Fig. 1B).
Consistent with the results of the TGF-a and VEGF
assays, we found significantly higher constitutive ADAM17
activity levels in HCT116 cell line than in HKH-2 cells
(Fig. 1B, left). Furthermore, treatment with 5-FU resulted
in a significant increase (1.6-fold) in ADAM17 activity in the
KrasMT HCT116 cell line but not in the KrasWT daughter
cell line (Fig. 1B, left). As no difference in total ADAM17
expression levels was observed between the two cell lines
(Fig. 1B, right), these results indicate that oncogenic Kras
regulates ADAM17 activity and growth factor shedding in
CRC.

Oncogenic Kras regulates TGF-a ligand shedding via a
MEK1/2-dependent mechanism
Using a human phospho-kinase array, we found higher
basal levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2 in the KrasMT
HCT116 cell line than in the KrasWT HKH-2 clone (data
not shown). To investigate the involvement of mutant Kras
and its downstream effector MEK1/2 in growth factor shedding, we used a gene-specific siRNA directed against Kras and
small molecule MEK inhibitors. Kras siRNA downregulated
Kras and decreased Erk1/2 activity at a concentration of 25
nmol/L in both cell lines (Fig. 2A; data not shown). Silencing
Kras completely attenuated 5-FU–induced TGF-a shedding in
HCT116 cells but had no effect on TGF-a ligand shedding
following 5-FU treatment in HKH-2 cells (Fig. 2A, left). Of note,
basal TGF-a shedding was not significantly affected by Kras
silencing. Moreover, we found that 3 different MEK inhibitors—AZD6244 (20), PD98059 (21), and UO126 (22)—significantly abrogated 5-FU–induced TGF-a shedding in HCT116
cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). MEK
inhibition also decreased constitutive TGF-a shedding in
HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
Similar effects were noted following treatment with SN-38 (the
active metabolite of irinotecan; Supplementary Fig. S3A).

These studies were extended into 5 more CRC cell line
models, the KrasMT (G13D) LoVo cell line, the KrasMT (G12D)
LS174T cell line, the KrasMT (G12V) SW620 cell line, the
BrafMT (V600E) LIM2405 cell line, and the KrasWT/BrafWT
CACO-2 cell line and the second HKe-3 KrasWT HCT116
clone. Similar to the data obtained with the HKH-2 KrasWT
clone, we found that both constitutive and 5-FU–induced
TGF-a shedding in HKe-3 cells were lower than those in
the KrasMT parental HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Constitutive TGF-a levels in KrasMT LoVo,
LS174T, SW620, and BrafMT LIM2405 varied between 12
and 140 pg/mL but were significantly higher than in the
KrasWT CACO-2 cell line (Fig. 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S3C). Furthermore, a significant increase in TGF-a shedding was observed following 5-FU treatment in the KrasMT
LoVo, LS174T, and SW620 and BrafMT LIM2405 cell lines
(Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3C). Importantly, MEK
inhibition abrogated basal and 5-FU–induced TGF-a shedding

1074

in the KrasMT and BrafMT cell lines. In contrast, basal TGF-a
shedding was low in the KrasWT/BrafWT CACO-2 cell line
and was unaffected by 5-FU or AZD6244 treatment (Fig. 2C).
To investigate whether the downstream MEK1/2 effector
Erk1/2 plays a role in regulating TGF-a shedding, siRNA and
dominant-negative approaches were used. Similar to the effect
of Kras silencing, transfection of dominant-negative ErkK52R
resulted in complete inhibition of TGF-a ligand shedding
following 5-FU treatment but had no effect on basal TGF-a
ligand shedding (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained using
Erk siRNA (data not shown).
Oncogenic Kras regulates ADAM17 activity via a MEK1/

Collectively, these data indicate that oncogenic Kras regulates TGF-a ligand shedding and that this process is
mediated via MEK1/2 and Erk1/2. We next determined
whether 5-FU–induced increases in ADAM17 activity were

similarly regulated. In HCT116 cells cotreated with a MEK
inhibitor (UO126) or transfected with either Kras- or Erktargeted siRNA, 5-FU–induced activation of ADAM17 was
abrogated (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that chemotherapy-induced activation of ADAM17 in KrasMT HCT116 cells
is Kras, MEK, and ERK dependent and is consistent with
ADAM17 regulating 5-FU–induced TGF-a shedding, as we
recently reported (10).
To investigate the in vivo relevance of these findings, we
assessed the effect of AZD6244 on the growth of KrasMT

HCT116 and KrasWT HKH-2 xenografts and the effect of
MEK inhibition on tumor ADAM17 activity and TGF-a
shedding. Consistent with the findings of others (14), we
found that the HKH-2 KrasWT cells did not grow well in vivo,
indicating the requirement for oncogenic Kras for tumor
growth (data not shown). Notably, very significant growth
retardation of the KrasMT HCT116 CRC xenografts was
observed in mice treated with AZD6244 (Fig. 3B, left).

Top, KrasMT cells exhibit strong activity of the MEK/ERK/ADAM17 survival pathway (bold font and arrows), particularly in the context of chemotherapy
treatment. AZD6244 inhibits pERK, the direct substrate of MEK, and switches off ADAM17 survival signaling through GFR and potentially through
other cytokines such as TNF-a. Signaling downstream of mutant Kras occurs independently of signaling through GFR (dotted line). Bottom, KrasWT cells are

addition, treatment with AZD6244 resulted in significantly
reduced levels of circulating human TGF-a in mice with
KrasMT HCT116 xenografts (Fig. 3C, left). This was also the
case when human TGF-a levels were adjusted to take into
account the larger sizes of the tumors in the vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 3C, right). Importantly, AZD6244 treatment
resulted in significant inhibition of ADAM17 activity levels

in HCT116 tumors (Fig. 3D). Moreover, caspase-3 cleavage
was observed in HCT116 tumors following treatment with
AZD6244, indicative of apoptosis induction (Fig. 3B, right).
Taken together, these results indicate that oncogenic Kras
induces TGF-a shedding by regulating ADAM17 activity
through MEK1/2 and Erk1/2. These data also suggest that
MEK1/2 inhibition abrogates Erk1/2 signaling and thereby
blocks ADAM17-mediated shedding of prosurvival growth
factors (Fig. 4A).

Role of mutant Kras in regulating response to MEK1/2
inhibition
These in vivo results suggest that KrasMT CRC cells are
highly sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibition, so we next directly
compared the effects of MEK1/2 inhibition on apoptosis in
KrasMT and KrasWT HCT116 cells. The Kras mutant
HCT116 was significantly (8-fold) more sensitive to MEK
inhibitor-induced apoptosis than the KrasWT cell line
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, AZD6244 treatment resulted in
higher levels of PARP cleavage and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in KrasMT HCT116 cells than in the
KrasWT daughter cell line (Fig. 4C). Similar data were
obtained following treatment with other MEK inhibitors
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Addition of exogenous
TGF-a resulted in significant decreases in apoptosis induction in AZD6244-treated KrasMT HCT116 cells, suggesting
that abrogation of TGF-a shedding following MEK inhibition
(Figs. 2 and 3) is an important mechanism of apoptosis
induction in response to these agents (Fig. 4D).
The effect of MEK1/2 inhibition on chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis was also determined. Although significant increases
in apoptosis were observed when AZD6244 was combined
with 5-FU in both HCT116 and HKH-2 cells, the enhancement
of apoptosis was significantly greater in the KrasMT HCT116

cells (Fig. 5A). We extended these studies to include the panel
of KrasMT (LS174T, SW620, LoVo, and HCC2998) and BrafMT
(HT-29, WiDR, LIM2405, and RKO) CRC cell lines models. A
supra-additive/synergistic increase in apoptosis was observed
when KrasMT or BrafMT CRC cells were cotreated with 5-FU
and AZD6244 (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5A). To
evaluate the level of synergy between AZD6244 and 5-FU,
we used the method of Chou and Talalay to calculate CI values
(19), which were below 0.7 for the majority of concentrations,
indicative of strong synergism in KrasMT and BrafMT CRC
cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S5B). These results
suggest that inhibitors of MEK1/2 may be particularly active
in combination with chemotherapy in CRC tumors with a Kras
or Braf mutation.
Role of ADAM17 in determining response to MEK1/2
inhibition
To directly investigate the role of ADAM17 in determining
sensitivity to the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244, we developed an
ADAM17-overexpressing HCT116 cell line model (cl4), which
we have previously shown to have 40-fold higher TACE activity
and 4-fold higher constitutive TGF-a ligand shedding than an
empty vector control cell line (10). We found that stable
overexpression of ADAM17 significantly reduced the levels

of apoptosis following AZD6244 treatment by flow cytometry
and Western blotting analysis of PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A and B,
left). Similar effects were noted following treatment with
UO126 (Fig. 6A, right). Furthermore, we found that the IC50
doses of AZD6244 and UO126 were approximately 10- and 5fold higher, respectively, in the ADAM17 cl4 cell line than in
the EV cell line (Table 1). Moreover, the reduced sensitivity to
MEK1/2 inhibition in the ADAM17-overexpressing daughter
cell line correlated with increased pAkt activity in this cell line
(Fig. 6B, left). AZD6244 treatment resulted in an accumulation
of catalytically inactive pMEK1/2, an effect that may be due to
abrogation of negative feedback between Erk1/2 and Braf and
which has been described previously (Fig. 6B; refs. 23, 24). To
rule out cell line–specific effects, KrasMT LoVo cells were
transiently transfected with ADAM17 and cells were evaluated
for their response to AZD6244 treatment. Similar to the data
obtained with ADAM17 cl4 clone, we found reduced levels of
PARP cleavage in ADAM17-transfected LoVo cells (A4) treated
with AZD6244 compared with control cells (Fig. 6B, right).

treatment in HCT116 cells (Fig. 6C). In addition, inhibiting
TGF-a using a siRNA approach was insufficient to reverse the
protective effect of ADAM17 on AZD6244-induced apoptosis
(data not shown). This is in keeping with our previous findings
that ADAM17 is a key "sheddase" for multiple growth factors
(e.g.. TGF-a, IGF-1, VEGF) and activator of their respective
prosurvival receptors (10). Importantly, overexpression of
active ADAM17 in vivo very significantly attenuated the antitumor activity of AZD6244 treatment (Fig. 6D). Collectively,
these data indicate that ADAM17 activity regulates the sensitivity of CRC tumors to AZD6244 treatment and further
confirm that inhibition of ADAM17 activity is a key mechanism of apoptosis induction following MEK1/2 inhibition in
KrasMT CRC cells.

Discussion
Use of the EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody cetuximab
in first- and second-line treatment of advanced CRC patients
has resulted in increased objective responses and progressionfree survival; however, this benefit is limited to patients with
KrasWT tumors (25, 26). Therefore, the identification of
therapeutic strategies to target KrasMT tumors is urgently
needed in this disease. We have found that chemotherapy
acutely activates ADAM17, which results in growth factor
shedding, GFR activation, and drug resistance in CRC tumors
(10). In light of this, we investigated the role of Kras mutations
in regulating growth factor shedding and ADAM17 activity.
Both constitutive and 5-FU–induced TGF-a and VEGF
shedding were significantly higher in the KrasMT cell line,
and this correlated with enhanced ADAM17 activity. Gangarosa and colleagues have previously shown that oncogenic
Kras(12V) and Hras(12V) could result in increased mRNA
transcripts for TGF-a and secreted TGF-a protein in RIE-1
cells (rat small intestine cells; 27). However, the present study
is the first to suggest that oncogenic Kras controls chemotherapy-induced growth factor shedding via the regulation of
ADAM17 activity. We found that the increase in chemotherapy-induced TGF-a shedding in the KrasMT HCT116 cell line
was completely abolished when MAP kinase signaling was
inhibited at the level of Kras, MEK, or ERK. Furthermore,
treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitors also resulted in significant
decreases in basal TGF-a shedding. Moreover, we found that
MEK1/2 inhibitors blocked 5-FU–induced TGF-a shedding in
a panel of cell lines, with KrasG13D mutation, KrasG12D
mutation, or Braf (V600E) mutation, indicating that these
effects are not dependent on the type of Kras mutation and
are also applicable to cells carrying a mutation in the downstream Braf kinase. Similar to the data obtained in the KrasWT
HCT116 clone, we found that TGF-a shedding was unaffected
by 5-FU or AZD6244 treatment in the KrasWT/BrafWT CACO2 cell line. Importantly, we further found that Kras silencing
and MEK1/2 or Erk1/2 inhibition completely abrogated 5-FU–
induced increases in ADAM17 activity in HCT116 cells. This is
the first study showing that the clinically relevant MEKinhibitor AZD6244 abrogates ADAM17 activity in KrasMT
CRC xenografts and decreases circulating levels of TGF-a.
Taken together, these findings indicate that oncogenic Kras

controls chemotherapy-induced growth factor shedding via
regulation of an MEK/Erk/ADAM17 signaling axis (Fig. 4A).
These results are consistent with previous data showing that
Erk could phosphorylate and associate with ADAM17 (11).
Previous reports have shown that KrasWT/BrafWT CRC
cells exhibit decreased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors UO126
and CI-1040 or AZD6244 compared with KrasMT cell lines,
using soft agar colony formation and MTT assays (28, 29).
Having shown key differences in Kras/MEK/Erk/ADAM17
survival signaling between the KrasMT HCT116 and the
KrasWT HKH-2 cells, we evaluated the effect of MEK inhibition on 5-FU–induced cell death in this model. Using several
MEK inhibitors, we found that the HCT116 cell line is highly
dependent on MEK for its survival, as MEK inhibition resulted
in significant induction of apoptosis. In contrast, the KrasWT
cell line was significantly less sensitive to apoptosis induced by
MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, when MEK inhibitors were
combined with 5-FU, we found a more potent increase in
apoptosis in the KrasMT HCT116 cell line than in the KrasWT
HKH-2 cell line. In addition, a synergistic activation of apoptosis was observed in vitro when AZD6244 was combined with
5-FU treatment in a broad panel of KrasMT and BrafMT CRC
cell lines. Importantly, treatment with AZD6244 resulted in
tumor regression and sustained suppression of HCT116 xenografts growth, and this was associated with significantly
reduced tumor ADAM17 activity levels, reduced TGF-a levels
in serum, and increased apoptosis. One previous study
reported that the HCT116 cell line is insensitive to MEK
inhibitors (28); however, in agreement with our results, other
studies have shown that this cell line is sensitive to MEK1/2
inhibition (29). Moreover, using in vivo models, we have shown
that AZD6244 treatment dramatically attenuates the growth
of KrasMT HCT116 xenografts.
The importance of ADAM17 activity as a mediator of
resistance to AZD6244 treatment was directly shown using
ADAM17-overexpressing HCT116 cell lines. We show for the
first time that ADAM17 overexpression abrogates sensitivity
to AZD6244 treatment alone and in combination with 5-FU
treatment. Importantly, overexpression of ADAM17 protected
HCT116 xenografts from the growth-inhibitory effects of
AZD6244 treatment in vivo. We have previously shown that
overexpression of ADAM17 increases activity of not only
HER1/3 but also other prosurvival receptors such as IGF-1,
VEGF, and Ephrin receptors (10), which may result in
enhanced downstream survival signaling and resistance to
MEK1/2-targeted agents (Fig. 4A).
In conclusion, we provide evidence that oncogenic Kras
controls ADAM17 activity and growth factor shedding following chemotherapy treatment in an MEK/Erk-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have found that KrasMT CRC cells
depend on Kras/MEK/Erk/ADAM17 pathway for their survival
and that KrasMT CRC tumors are vulnerable to MEK1/2
inhibitors (at least in part) due to their dependency on
ADAM17 activity (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that inhibition
of MEK1/2 in combination with chemotherapy treatment
may represent a promising treatment strategy in KrasMT
and BrafMT CRC tumors and provide a preclinical
rationale for the ongoing dose finding and phase II study of
