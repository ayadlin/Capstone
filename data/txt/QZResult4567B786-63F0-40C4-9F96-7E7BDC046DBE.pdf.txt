ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic syndrome that predisposes individuals to
multiple benign tumors of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including vestibular
schwannomas. Currently, there are no FDA approved drug therapies for NF2. Loss of
function of merlin encoded by the NF2 tumor suppressor gene leads to activation of multiple
mitogenic signaling cascades, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
and SRC in Schwann cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether ponatinib, an
FDA-approved ABL/SRC inhibitor, reduced proliferation and/or survival of merlin-deficient
human Schwann cells (HSC). Merlin-deficient HSC had higher levels of phosphorylated
PDGFRα/β, and SRC than merlin-expressing HSC. A similar phosphorylation pattern was
observed in phospho-protein arrays of human vestibular schwannoma samples compared
to normal HSC. Ponatinib reduced merlin-deficient HSC viability in a dose-dependent
manner by decreasing phosphorylation of PDGFRα/β, AKT, p70S6K, MEK1/2, ERK1/2
and STAT3. These changes were associated with decreased cyclin D1 and increased
p27Kip1levels, leading to a G1 cell-cycle arrest as assessed by Western blotting and flow
cytometry. Ponatinib did not modulate ABL, SRC, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or paxillin
phosphorylation levels. These results suggest that ponatinib is a potential therapeutic
agent for NF2-associated schwannomas and warrants further in vivo investigation.

known as merlin or schwannomin [2, 3]. Merlin belongs
to the Band 4.1 family of proteins that link the actin
cytoskeleton to membrane receptors and transporters.
Merlin modulates the activity of multiple signaling
pathways that control cell size, morphology, cell adhesion,
proliferation, and survival. These include receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK; e.g. ErbB2/3, PDGFR, EGFR, HGFR), small
GTPases, FAK/SRC, the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR)/PI3K/AKT, and Hippo pathways [4]. Currently,
surgery and radiation are the mainstream treatment options
for NF2-associated tumors. Depending on the tumor

INTRODUCTION
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a non-malignant
tumor disorder affecting the peripheral and central nervous
systems. Although bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS)
are a diagnostic hallmark of the disorder, NF2 patients
typically develop multiple meningiomas, ependymomas
and other schwannomas as well. VS lead to deafness,
tinnitus, imbalance and can cause life-threatening
brainstem compression [1]. NF2 is caused by mutations
in the NF2 gene that encodes the tumor suppressor protein

size and location, there are significant adverse effects
associated with their removal. While an understanding
of the biological functions of merlin is progressing, welldefined druggable molecular targets have yet to emerge.
Increasingly, patients are treated off-label with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab that also reduces edema in
schwannomas without affecting the tumor cells. Dosing
regimens are being optimized to reduce associated kidney
toxicity observed with prolonged bevacizumab treatment
[1, 5]. However, to date there are no FDA-approved
therapies that target schwannoma cells directly and reduce
morbidity and mortality of NF2 patients [1, 6].
Because of the slow-growing and benign nature
of NF2 schwannomas, conventional chemotherapeutic
agents are unsuccessful. Several RTK inhibitors have been
investigated in preclinical studies and clinical trials with
limited patient response. These include lapatinib (an EGFR/
ErbB2 inhibitor; NCT00973739, NCT00863122), nilotinib
(a PDGFR and c-kit inhibitor; NCT01201538), sorafenib
(a VEGFR-2, PDFGRβ, and c-kit inhibitor), and axitinib
(a VEGFR, c-kit, and PDGFRβ inhibitor; NCT02129647)
[1, 7]. We selected ponatinib for evaluation because it is
an FDA-approved drug that inhibits a relevant RTK, the
PDGFR, and a downstream effector common to several
NF2 activated pathways, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase
SRC. PDGFR and SRC signaling regulate cell survival,
proliferation, migration and angiogenesis in many cell types
[8, 9]. PDGFR is over-expressed and activated in VS and
primary human schwannoma cells, consistent with merlin’s
role in downregulating surface levels of growth factor
receptors [10-13]. In HEI-193 schwannoma cells, merlin
overexpression inhibits cell proliferation by promoting
PDGFR internalization and degradation [14]. There is
evidence that SRC activity is deregulated in cells with loss
of merlin function and thus is a candidate for therapeutic
targeting. In human schwannoma cells, SRC activity is
increased compared to normal Schwann cells, and in mouse
glia cells, merlin inhibits proliferation by modulating SRC
activity [15, 16]. Lastly, primary human schwannoma cells
treated with the SRC inhibitor SU6656 exhibit decreased
transcription of proliferation-associated genes [17]. Thus,
an inhibitor that targets both PDGFR and SRC might have
therapeutic value for NF2-associated tumors.
Ponatinib (AP24534, brand name: Iclusig®) is a
third generation type IIA inhibitor of ABL/SRC tyrosine
kinase (TK). It is orally active and initially received
accelerated approval in 2012 for adult patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Ph+ ALL) that are T315I-positive and are not candidates
for other TK inhibitors. Ponatinib binds the inactive,
DFG-out (aspartic acid, phenylalanine and glycine)
ABL/SRC conformation [18, 19]. In a cell-free kinase
screen, ponatinib inhibited SRC with IC50 of 5.4nM and
PDGFRα and PDGFRβ with IC50 of 1.1nM and 7.7nM,
respectively [19].

In this study, we measured the ability of ponatinib
to decrease proliferation and survival of merlin-deficient
HSC and vestibular schwannoma cells with NF2 mutations.
We found that ponatinib caused a G1 cell-cycle arrest and
mapped the regulatory signaling cascades modulated by the
inhibitor. Our findings support further in vivo evaluation of
ponatinib as a candidate drug for NF2 schwannomas.

RESULTS
Ponatinib decreases viability of merlin-deficient
HSC and vestibular schwannoma (VS) cells
To create a suitable cell line for drug discovery
studies, we first authenticated primary HSC based on their
expression of human nuclear antigen and Schwann cell
markers, S100, PLP, and O4 (Figure 1A). We then used
lentiviral delivery of NF2-shRNA to reduce expression
of merlin in the primary HSC. Merlin levels were stably
reduced to nearly undetectable levels in the transduced
cells compared to the parental HSC (Figure 1B, C). The
merlin-deficient HSC did not contact inhibit but did not
form aggregates and grows in multiple layers; many of
these merlin-deficient HSC maintained an elongated
morphology when cultured in the presence of serum and
mitogens (Supplementary Figure 1AB). We measured
basal levels of PDGFRα/β and SRC phosphorylation
in primary HSC prior to and following knockdown of
merlin. We found that depletion of merlin expression
was associated with increased levels of p-PDGFRα/β and
p-SRC compared to the parental HSC (Figure 1B). This
finding agrees with previous reports of increased activation
of the PDGFR and SRC pathways in human schwannomas
compared to normal human nerve [10, 20, 21].
We screened the ability of ponatinib to reduce
viability of multiple control and merlin-deficient HSC
lines. As controls, we tested the parental wild-type HSC
(HSC-WT), HSC expressing a scrambled shRNA construct
(HSC-SCR), HSC expressing a Turbo-GFP shRNA
(HSC-GFP), and merlin-deficient HSC lines (MD-HSC)
expressing shRNA sequences that target the human NF2
gene, (MD-HSC #45, #74 #75 and #77). All control HSC
expressed merlin, whereas the HSCs transduced with
shRNA constructs targeting the NF2 gene had nearly
undetectable merlin levels (Figure 1D). We performed 48
hour dose-response viability assays on the seven HSC lines
in complete growth medium containing serum and growth
factors. The results indicated that ponatinib reduced viability
of all of the cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
1E). Under the conditions tested, ponatinib was not selective
for MD-HSC over scrambled, GFP or untransduced HSC
(IC50 HSC-SCR= 3.3μM, HSC-GFP=2.4 μM, HSC-WT=
2.3 μM, MD-HSC#45= 2.2 μM, MD-HSC#74= 3.3 μM,
MD-HSC#75= 1.9 μM and MD-HSC#77=3.7 μM). The
average maximal response at 10μM was a 71% decrease in
cell viability. However, when control merlin-expressing cell

line (HSC-WT) and merlin-deficient HSC (MD-HSC#45)
were cultured in the absence of serum and mitogens, merlindeficient HSC were significantly more sensitive to 0.25 μM
ponatinib than the merlin-expressing HSC (Figure 1F,G).
We tested ponatinib’s effect on cultured human
vestibular schwannoma cells with NF2 mutations. We
assessed relative cell viability using a crystal violet assay
following 48 hour incubation with ponatinib. Cell viability
was reduced by approximately 40% at 2μM in VS1 and

induced a dose-dependent increase in the total SRC protein
level but did not alter the levels of the other SRC family
members, FYN and YES, that play important roles in SC
biology as well (Figure 2B) [22, 23]. We found a slight
increase in SRC-Tyr416 phosphorylation in merlin-deficient
HSC treated with 0.3 to 3μM (with a peak at 1μM). The
phosphorylation pattern, however, did not coincide with the
increase in the SRC protein levels (Figure 2B).
Key effectors transducing extracellular matrix
adhesion and growth factor-dependent stimuli in
Schwann cells are the SRC substrates, FAK and paxillin,
a focal adhesion-associated adaptor [24]. FAK is a
key mediator of extracellular matrix-integrin and RTK
signaling that is upregulated in schwannomas [10]. Upon
FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr397, SRC binds the
phosphorylated residue and phosphorylates FAK on Tyr576
and Tyr577, resulting in stabilizing the activation loop of
FAK in the active conformation and its binding to substrates,

Ponatinib did not reduce net levels of ABL phosphorylation in merlin-deficient HSC (Figure 2A). Ponatinib

thereby providing FAK with maximal activity [25]. In turn,
FAK either directly or via SRC, phosphorylates paxillin
at Tyr118 [26]. We therefore assessed FAK and paxillin
phosphorylation in merlin-deficient HSC treated for 2h
with increasing ponatinib concentrations. Western blot
analysis showed that ponatinib did not reduce FAK-Tyr576
or Tyr577 or paxillin-Tyr118 phosphorylation similar to
the SRC-Tyr416 phosphorylation pattern (Figure 2C and
Supplementary Figure 2). Together the results demonstrate
that the ABL, SRC, FAK and paxillin pathways are not
inhibited by ponatinib in merlin-deficient HSC.

concentrations of ponatinib. We found that ponatinib
reduced phosphorylation of PDGFRα/β at Tyr849/Tyr857,
the autophosphorylation sites in the activation loop of these
kinases, in a dose-dependent manner without altering the
PDGFRα/β protein levels (Figure 3). In addition, ponatinib
reduced phosphorylation of three additional tyrosine
residues in PDGFRβ at positions 740, 771 and 1021
(Figure 3). Phosphorylation of these residues increases
affinity for binding and activating PI3K, SRC, the GTPase
Activator of Ras (GAP), GRB2, and PLCγ [27]. When
cells are stimulated with growth factors, AKT (also known
as protein kinase B) and p70 S6 kinase are activated in a
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway.
Thr308 in the AKT activation loop and Thr229 in the
p70S6 kinase catalytic domain are phosphorylated by
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in
vivo and in vitro [28, 29]. Therefore to probe activity of
the PI3K pathway in ponatinib-treated cells, we assessed
AKT-Thr308 phosphorylation and p70S6 kinase-Thr229

phosphorylation by Western blots. We found that both
AKT-Thr308 and p70S6 kinase-Thr229 underwent a dosedependent decrease in phosphorylation (Figure 4A,B).
Previous studies demonstrated that overexpression
and activation of PDGFRβ strongly activates MEK1/2 and
ERK1/2 in human schwannoma cells leading to enhanced
proliferation [10]. We assessed the phosphorylated
MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 levels in merlin-deficient HSC
after ponatinib treatment. We found that ponatinib
treatment was associated with a dose-dependent decrease
in MEK1/2-Ser217/Ser221 and ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204
phosphorylation in merlin-deficient HSC (Figure 4C).
Although net inhibition of SRC phosphorylation
was not observed, ligand binding to PDGFR promotes
receptor binding to SRC and recruitment of STAT3,

followed by Tyr705 auto-phosphorylation of STAT3 and
its dimerization and translocation into the nucleus to
directly drive gene expression needed for cell proliferation
[30-32]. Western blot analysis showed that ponatinib
decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent
manner in merlin-deficient HSC (Figure 4D).
Lastly, to further evaluate the contribution of PI3K/
AKT, MEK, or STAT3 inhibition downstream to PDGFR
responsible for ponatinib’s effect, we individually
inhibited AKT with perifosine/KRX-0401, MEK with
selumetinib/AZD6244, and STAT3 with S3I-201/NSC74859 and compared the results to ponatinib’s effects
on cell viability. MEK, AKT or STAT3 inhibition alone
only partially decreased merlin-deficient HSC viability.
Inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201 was the least effective,

and although selumetinib was more efficacious than
perifosine and S3I-201, none of individual inhibitors
even at the highest concentration tested (10 μM) matched
ponatinib’s efficacy (Figure 4E). These results suggest that
simultaneous inhibition of these three pathways occurs in
response to ponatinib and similarly contributes to the loss
of viability of merlin-deficient HSC.

expression of cyclin D1 in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
Moreover, STAT3 transcriptionally regulates cyclin-D1
by binding to its promoter region [33, 34]. We assessed
the level of cyclin D1 in merlin-deficient HSC after a
24h incubation with ponatinib. We found that ponatinib
strongly decreased cyclin D1 protein levels in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A). These results suggest that
ponatinib reduces the viability of merlin-deficient HSC
by inhibiting PDGFRα/β-dependent activation of MEK/
ERK and STAT3 pathways, leading to decreased cyclin
D1 expression.

viability of merlin-deficient HSC by ponatinib was a
consequence of cell-cycle blockage due to reduced cyclin

D1 expression, we analyzed the distribution of cells
among the different phases of the cell cycle. There was a
significant increase in the number of cells in the G1 phase
when treated with 3 and 5μM ponatinib compared to
vehicle controls (72% ±8% and 74% ±7% vs. 47% ±2% of
control). This was accompanied by a concomitant decrease

in the number of S-phase cells observed in ponatinibtreated samples as compared with control samples (7.5%
±1% for 3μM and 7% ±1% at 5μM vs. 29% ±3% of
control) (Figure 5B–5C). At the lower concentrations (1
through 5μM), ponatinib arrested merlin-deficient HSC at
G1, indicating a cytostatic mechanism of action. However,

proliferation. SRC activation of FAK and paxillin is not modulated by ponatinib. Ponatinib decreases cell viability through downstream

by analyzing the live/dead populations, at a higher
concentration (10μM), ponatinib became cytotoxic (Figure
5D). The increase in the number of dead cells present in
the cells treated with 10μM ponatinib coincides with the
decrease in phosphorylated proteins studied here.
Lastly, we analyzed the correlation of the cellcycle phases with levels of several cell cycle regulators.
Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 (p27Kip1)
is a key negative regulator of Cdk activity in cells
progressing from G1 toward S phase [35]. We analyzed
the expression of p27Kip1 in conjunction with DNA content
by flow cytometry. We found fewer p27Kip1-positive cells
in G1 in control cells compared with a large increase in
p27Kip1-positive cells in G1 in ponatinib-treated samples
(Figure 6A). Similarly, we found a greater number of
cyclin D1-positive cells in control samples in G1 in
contrast to ponatinib-treated samples (Figure 6B). This
result correlates with that observed from the Western blot
experiment (Figure 5A). Overlay of the p27Kip1 and cyclin
D1 plots with the cell-cycle plots clearly demonstrate that
ponatinib induced G1 arrest with associated changes in
the cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 levels in merlin-deficient HSC
(Supplementary Figure 3AB). Our results are consistent
with ponatinib inhibition of PDGFR and downstream
PI3K activity leading to a G1 cell-cycle arrest of merlindeficient HSC by blocking ERK- and STAT3-dependent
expression of cyclin D1 (Figure 6C).

PDGFRα/β, in agreement with studies in primary human
NF2 schwannoma cells [36]. Ponatinib stimulated a
robust G1 cell cycle arrest of merlin-deficient HSC in a
dose-dependent manner by inhibiting PDGFRα/β and its
downstream effectors AKT, p70S6 kinase, MEK/ERK
and STAT3, leading to reduced levels of cyclin D1 and
increased levels of p27Kip1. Intriguingly, ponatinib did not
reduce ABL/SRC/FAK/paxillin net phosphorylation in
merlin-deficient HSC. We did not find clear evidence of
ABL and SRC inhibition in merlin-deficient HSC treated
with ponatinib. However, we found that ponatinib induced
a dose-dependent increase in the SRC levels in the HSC.
Similar results been reported for SRC inhibition with
AZD0530 of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemia
cell lines. We speculate that this is due to a compensatory
feedback mechanism, suggesting SRC kinase inhibition by
ponatinib [37]. Other SRC family members, such as Fyn
and Yes, did not change their protein levels in ponatinibtreated cells. In some CML cases of imatinib resistance,
upregulation of SRC kinase has been implicated as a
BCR-ABL-independent mechanism responsible for
imatinib failure [38-40]. Therefore the increase in SRC
protein levels observed ponatinib-treated HSC may be an
adaptive response. It would be interesting to investigate if
other SRC inhibitors, including SU6656, that have antiproliferative activity in primary human schwannoma cells,
also increase SRC levels [20, 41].
Ponatinib lacked selectivity for the merlin-deficient
HSC over NF2 wild-type HSC when cultured in the
presence of serum and mitogens. This is comparable
to results reported by others with the MEK1 inhibitor
AZD6244 in primary human schwannoma cells and
normal Schwann cells grown in serum-containing medium
[21]. Notably, when cells were incubated in growth
arresting medium (SCM base + N2 supplement) in the
presence of 0.25 μM ponatinib for one week, merlindeficient HSC showed a greater sensitivity to the drug
than merlin-expressing HSC. To maintain fetus derived
cell lines amenable to drug discovery studies, we routinely
culture these embryonic Schwann cells in the presence of
serum and other mitogenic supplements, which induces
Schwann cells to proliferate. In contrast, both myelinating
and non-myelinating Schwann cells are post-mitotic in
normal nerves [42-44]. Only after nerve injury do adult
Schwann cells de-differentiate and proliferate as part of
the nerve repair process [21, 45-48]. Thus, ponatinib’s
lack of in vitro selectivity is not a cause for concern for
in vivo studies and its potential as a therapeutic for NF2associated schwannomas.

To assess activation of PDGFRα/β and SRC in
human schwannomas, we surveyed a phospho-proteome
profile comparing five human vestibular schwannoma
specimens with primary normal adult human Schwann
cells cultured in the presence of mitogens to stimulate
their proliferation. Analysis of phospho-receptor tyrosine
kinase and phospho-kinases proteome profiler arrays
revealed that schwannomas consistently had higher levels
of phosphorylated PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, SRC, MEK and
STAT3 compared with control primary HSC (Figure 7
A-D). Schwannomas exhibited averaged 6.6 times higher
PDGFRα phosphorylation, 5.4 times higher PDGFRβ
phosphorylation, 30 times higher SRC phosphorylation,
5.6 times higher MEK phosphorylation and 7.4 times
higher STAT3 phosphorylation compared with control
primary HSC (Figure 7 A-D).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated whether ponatinib,
a BCR-ABL/SRC inhibitor approved for use in
leukemia, could potentially be repurposed for treatment
of NF2 schwannomas. Following merlin depletion,
HSC increased the levels of phosphorylated SRC and

internalization of activated PDGFRβ, a role consistent
with increased expression and activation of mitogenic
receptors in NF2 schwannomas [13, 14]. In Schwann
cells, PDGFRα and β signaling are central to cell
proliferation and survival through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [49-51]. In the four
schwannoma samples with chronic merlin loss, the p-AKT
Ser473 levels downstream of mTORC2 were reported as
consistently reduced across tumor samples relative to
normal arachnoid and meningioma tissues, as well as in

one immortalized human SC line with acute loss of merlin
achieved by an RNAi compared to the immortalized
human merlin-expressing SC line [52]. The consistent
decrease in mTORC2 signaling activity in schwannoma
and merlin-deficient Schwann cells mimics the PDGFR
activity results in schwannomas reported by others and our
phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase arrays showing a high
PDGFR phosphorylation levels in all tumors tested (Figure
7 and 1) [10-12]. Consistent with PDGFR inhibition, we
observed a dose-dependent decrease in AKT-Thr308

phosphorylation, a PI3K-dependent phosphorylation site,
and a decrease in MEK/ERK phosphorylation, similar to
those reported in sorafenib-treated schwannoma cells [10,
53, 54]. Moreover, we demonstrated a dose-dependent
reduction of cyclin D1 levels that correlates with STAT3
inactivation. STAT3 induces cyclin D1 transcription by
binding its promoter region; and ERK1/2 has plays a
critical role for induction of cyclin D1 (Figure 6C) [33, 34,
55, 56]. Decreased cyclin-D1 expression together with an
increase in the p27Kip1 level are key to the G1 to S phase
progression block that we observed in ponatinib-treated
HSCs.
Unlike traditional dual SRC/ABL inhibitors,
ponatinib is a reversible, third-generation inhibitor
that binds the unphosphorylated inactive DFG-out
conformation of both enzymes [57]. Ponatinib was
designed to overcome resistance-inducing BCR-ABL
mutations in CML and ALL treated with the first- and
second-generation TK inhibitors. It is considered a panBCR-ABL inhibitor because it is potently active on ABLT315I and fourteen other mutants [19]. Ponatinib shows
inhibitory activity against ABL/SRC, PDGFR and other
kinases, including the FGFR (fibroblast growth factor
receptor), Ephrin receptors, FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine
kinase 3), VEGFR1-3 (vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 1-3), Ret (rearranged during transfection) and KIT
(mast/stem cell growth factor receptor) [19]. Ponatinib
therapy, similar to other TK inhibitors, is associated with
severe adverse events, such as arterial thrombosis and
liver toxicity, and older patients (>65 years) had higher
risk of experiencing adverse effect than younger patients
[58, 59]. In a large group of children and adolescents
with CML treated with imatinib, assessment of long term
growth revealed growth deceleration in both genders
[60]. Therefore, adverse effects of long-term treatment in
children should be carefully weighed.
Whereas short-term treatment with ponatinib leads
to cytostasis, prolonged treatment could lead to cell death
or senescence [61, 62]. These sequelae have been reported
for B precursor or T cells from ALL patients treated
with ponatinib; the treated cells underwent apoptosis
after a G1 cell-cycle arrest by increasing endogenous
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [63].
Drugs that simply slow schwannoma growth would
benefit NF2 patients enormously. If a long-term use of
ponatinib is envisioned, we speculate that ponatinib may
be used at lower doses in a combinatorial therapeutic
approach with other compounds targeting interconnecting
pathways, thereby limiting adverse effects. The different
mechanisms of kinase inhibition and diverse range and
selectivity of small-molecule kinase inhibitors requires
that each drug be studied in NF2-relevant cell types, and
weighed independently. To this extent, ponatinib treatment
effectively reduced viability of merlin-deficient HSC
with a robust arrest at the G1 phase. Ponatinib therapy
may be applicable to a larger patient population than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NF2, considering that merlin inactivation also occurs in
sporadic schwannomas. Future in vivo studies addressing
ponatinib alone or in combination as an effective therapy
for schwannomas in NF2 mouse models are warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and human vestibular
schwannomas
The merlin-deficient HSC line was generated
from primary fetal HSC purchased from ScienCell
(lot #7228) and authenticated by immunostaining for
expression of human nuclear antigen, and SC markers,
S100, PLP, O4, and Gap43, and Nestin. Cells were
transduced with lentiviral particles expressing human
NF2 gene-specific shRNA (GenBank accession no.
NM_000268; TRCN0000237845; TRCN0000039974;
TRCN0000039975 and TRCN0000039977, SigmaAldrich), shRNA Scrambled, or Turbo-GFP control
(Sigma-Aldrich) and then selected with 0.5 mg/ml
puromycin. Wild-type and merlin-deficient HSC were
cultured in CellBIND dishes (Corning) in complete
Schwann cell media (SCM) from ScienCell (basal
Schwann cell medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum,
Schwann cell growth supplements which contains growth
factors, hormones, and proteins necessary for the culture
of normal human Schwann cells and 1X-penicillin/
streptomycin) unless otherwise specified. Cells were used
between passages 9 to 18. Merlin levels were assessed by
Western blotting.
Frozen human schwannomas used in phosphoproteome studies were procured with patient informed
consent at The Ohio State University College of Medicine
according to Institutional Review Board regulations.
Human vestibular schwannoma (VS) cells cultured to test
ponatinib efficacy were isolated from dissociated fresh
human tumors. Fresh VS specimens were procured with
patient informed consent at University of Miami Miller
School of Medicine according to Institutional Review
Board regulations through the Tissue Bank Core Facility.
Normal primary human SCs, a gift from Dr. Patrick
Wood (The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University of
Miami Miller School of Medicine), were used in phosphoproteome studies, and cultured as previously described [64].

Antibody proteome profiler arrays
Human phospho-RTK (ARY001) and phosphokinase array (ARY003) kits were purchased from R&D
systems. Human schwannoma homogenates and control
HSC lysates were prepared and analyzed according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were visualized with
chemiluminescence and were quantified with ImageJ

increasing concentrations of ponatinib in 0.1% DMSO or
vehicle alone for 48h. The CellTiter-Fluor cell viability
assay (Promega) was used according to manufacturer’s
specifications [53].
To evaluate cell viability without artificially
stimulating proliferation, control and merlin-deficient HSC
were cultured and assayed in growth suppressive medium
(SCM base, 1X-penicillin/streptomycin –ScienCell, plus
N2 supplement-Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 24 well
plates (Corning-CellBIND) at 60,000 cells/well in four
replicates, after 4 days incubation at 37°C, 7% CO2, cells
were treated with 0.25μM ponatinib or a vehicle control
for one week. Viability was assessed with a crystal violet
assay as previously described [64].
To evaluate cell viability of primary VS cells with
NF2 mutations, two fresh VS were obtained from the
Tissue Bank Core Facility at the University of Miami
Miller School of Medicine. VS tumors were cut into 1
mm pieces and dissociated in 0.5 mg/ml collagenase
(~150U/ml) and dispase (2.5 mg/ml) in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma) for 1h followed by
0.25% Trypsin for 30 minutes at 37°C. Digested tissue
was triturated and centrifuged at 1500 rpm at 4°C
for 10 minutes. Supernatant was discarded and cells
were resuspended and cultured using Schwann Cell
Media (ScienCell) on culture flasks pre-treated with
0.1% poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and 25 mg/ml laminin
(ThermoScientific). Cells from Passage 2 were then
seeded in a 96 well plate (Costar, Corning) at 5,000
cells/well in six replicates. After 24 hours of incubation
at 37°C, 5% CO2, cells were treated with ponatinib
at different concentrations or 0.05% DMSO for 48h.
Viability was assessed with a crystal violet assay as
previously described [64].

Western blot analysis
Cultured HSCs were lysed in modified RIPA buffer
as previously described [65] or in 1X-SDS loading
buffer plus 2.5 U/ml benzonase. 10 μg of protein or 10
μl 1X-loading buffer lysate were resolved in 4–20%
polyacrylamide gels (Pierce), transferred to PVDF
membranes (Immobilon-FL; Millipore), blocked with
5% BSA in TBS, and incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, and then with their corresponding
fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:25,0001:40,000 dilution. Image acquisition was done using LICOR® Biosciences Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System
and quantification using Odyssey Image Studio Version
3.1software and ImageJ 1.46r.

DNA sequencing of VS
Genomic DNA was isolated and purified using
Trizol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
A total of 17 pairs of primers were designed for the
amplification and sequencing of the coding exons and
their flanking splice sites using the Primer 3 program
(http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). The complete coding
sequences of NF2 were amplified by PCR. DNA (~1 μg)
was amplified with NF2-specific primer pairs in 50μL,
containing 10X PCR Buffer (pH 8.5), 0.4 mM dNTP mix
(Promega Corporation), 0.4 pmol/μL of each primer,
and 0.0625 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Eppendorf
AG). DNA templates were amplified using the following
program: 95°C for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94°C for 50 s, 60°C
for 50 s, 72°C for 60 s; and final extension of 72°C for
5 min. Direct sequencing of PCR products were performed
on both strands using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator
reaction kit and ABI 3100 DNA sequencer or with
Beckman Coulter 2000 XL instrument and appropriate
kits.

Immunocytochemistry
Cells were grown on German glass coverslips coated
with 200 μg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). HSCs
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained,
and stained images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM710
confocal microscope as previously described [64]. Images
were processed with ZEN2011 software.

Cell viability assay
HSC were seeded at 2,500 cells/well in 20 μl of
phenol-red free SCM (SCM phenol-red free base, 5%
serum, Schwann cell growth supplements containing
growth factors, hormones, and proteins and 1X-penicillin/
streptomycin) in 384-well plates and incubated with

The Click-iT EdU, FxCycle stain and Live/
Dead fixable dead cell stain kits were purchased from
Molecular Probes (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells
were seeded in 6-well plates and treated overnight with
an inhibitor or vehicle. On the next day, 10 μM EdU
was added to the cultures for 3 h, and then cells were
harvested (total 24-h inhibitor incubation), stained
with fixable violet live/dead stain, and permeabilized.
EdU and DNA labeling was conducted according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Cell cycle analysis was done
on gated live cells. For the cyclin D1/p27Kip1 expression
study [66], cultures were treated with an inhibitor
or vehicle for 24 h and then harvested, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C, chilled for 1 min,
and permeabilized for 30 min in 90% methanol. Fixed
cells were transferred to a Falcon 5 ml tube through a cell
strainer cap, rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA in PBS, and
immunostained by incubating for 1h at room temperature
with a cyclin D1 (1:400) or p27Kip1 (1:3,000) antibody,
followed by a 30-min incubation with a goat anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse-Alexa488 secondary antibody. After one
wash, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5% BSA and
stained for 30 min with 200nM FxCycle Far Red DNA
stain supplemented with 0.1mg/ml of ribonucleaseA
(Invitrogen). A BD FACS Canto-II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) with the BD FACSDiva™ 6.1.3 software
was used for data acquisition and FlowJo software was
used for data analysis.
