ABSTRACT:
Background: Since PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation diminishes the effects of
hormone therapy, combining aromatase inhibitors (anatrozole) with mTOR inhibitors
(everolimus) was investigated.
Patients and Methods: We evaluated anastrozole and everolimus in 55 patients
with metastatic estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast
and gynecologic tumors. Endpoints were safety, antitumor activity and molecular
correlates.
Results: Full doses of anastrozole (1 mg PO daily) and everolimus (10 mg PO
daily) were well tolerated. Twelve of 50 evaluable patients (24%) (median = 3 prior
therapies) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months/partial response (PR)/complete
response (CR) (n = 5 (10%) with PR/CR): 9 of 32 (28%) with breast cancer (n=5
(16%) with PR/CR); 2 of 10 (20%), ovarian cancer; and 1 of 6 (17%), endometrial
cancer. Six of 22 patients (27%) with molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR. Six of 8 patients (75%) with SD ≥ 6
months/PR/CR with molecular testing demonstrated at least one alteration in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway: mutations in PIK3CA (n=3) and AKT1 (n=1) or PTEN
loss (n=3). All three responders (CR (n = 1); PR (n=2)) who had next generation
sequencing demonstrated additional alterations: amplifications in CCNE1, IRS2, MCL1,
CCND1, FGFR1 and MYC and a rearrangement in PRKDC.
Conclusions: Combination anastrozole and everolimus is well tolerated at full
approved doses, and is active in heavily-pretreated patients with ER and/or PRpositive breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Responses were observed in
patients with multiple molecular aberrations.

INTRODUCTION

of treatment. All patients were considered eligible for
toxicity evaluation. Fifty patients were considered eligible
for response evaluation. Five patients were ineligible
for response evaluation because they had not reached
restaging at the time of analysis. Demographic and clinical
characteristics of evaluable patients are summarized in
Table 1. The median age of patients was 57 years (range:
24-82 years). The median number of prior therapies in
the advanced or metastatic setting was 3 (range: 0-13).
Twenty-three of the evaluable patients had received prior
aromatase inhibitors. Fifteen deaths occurred, all attributed
to disease progression. Expansion cohorts were opened for
breast, endometrial, ovarian and cervical tumor types and
for patients with PTEN loss and PIK3CA mutations.

Estrogens regulate growth, differentiation and
development in many tissues including the female
reproductive tract, bone, central nervous system,
immune and cardiovascular systems [1-3]. The actions of
estrogens are mediated by a group of estrogen receptors
(ER). Aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P450
superfamily, catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis
of estrogen from androgen [4]. In women with breast
cancer, the expression of aromatase is the highest in or
near tumor sites [5, 6]. Anastrozole (Arimidex) is a potent
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, producing approximately
97% inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis [7].
Several studies have evaluated combination
approaches using hormone therapy with other targeted
agents in patients with breast and gynecologic cancers.
The Bolero-2 trial (trial registration ID: NCT00863655),
a large randomized Phase III study, compared the
aromatase inhibitor exemestane alone to a combination of
exemestane with everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor [8]. The
combination improved progression-free survival (PFS)
in patients with ER and/or progesterone receptor (PR)positive advanced and metastatic breast cancer. Based on
data from the Bolero-2 trial, in July 2012 the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved everolimus in
combination with exemestane for use in postmenopausal
women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neunegative, advanced breast cancer who have progressed
on anastrozole or letrozole. Other studies have evaluated
the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in combination with
everolimus and have demonstrated responses in patients
with metastatic endometrial carcinoma (trial registration
ID: NCT01068249) [9] and breast cancer (trial registration
ID: NCT00107016) [10].
Research into the mechanism of endocrine
responsiveness and resistance in breast and gynecologic
cancers has revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
becomes activated and utilized by cancer cells to bypass
the effects of hormone therapy [11-13]. We therefore
investigated the use of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole
in combination with everolimus in patients with ER and/
or PR-positive breast and gynecologic tumors including
ovarian and endometrial cancer (trial registration ID:
NCT01197170) and including an analysis of molecular
data.

Overall Survival and Time to Treatment Failure
The median survival has not been reached after a
median follow up of 6.1 months. At the time of analysis,
37 of 55 (67%) were off study. The overall median TTF
was 3.1 months (95% CI 2.1-4.1).

Dose Escalation, DLT and Tolerance
Seven patients were enrolled at dose level 1 and 48
at dose level 2. Two of 55 patients (4%) experienced a
DLT. The two DLTs both occurred in expansion cohorts of
dose level 2 and were grade 3 mucositis. The full federal
drug administration (FDA) dose for each drug evaluated
in dose level 2 (anastrozole 1 mg PO daily and everolimus
10 mg PO daily) was found to be safe and well tolerated.
Twenty-five of 55 patients (45%) experienced at
least one drug-related toxicity. Of the 36 reported drugrelated toxicities, 25 (69%) were grade 1 or 2. The most
common grade 1 and 2 drug-related toxicities included
mucositis (6 patients), fatigue (4 patients), nausea/
vomiting/anorexia, elevated cholesterol, pneumonitis,
elevated triglycerides and elevated ALT (2 patients each).
There were 11 grade 3 toxicities at least possibly related
to treatment including mucositis (2 patients), pneumonitis,
hypertension, hyperglycemia, hemoptysis, weakness,
rash, low platelets, elevated AST and decreased ANC (1
patient each). A dose modification was required in four
incidents for mucositis (2 patients), nausea (1 patient), and
pneumonitis (1 patient). Two patients with pneumonitis
(including one with grade 2 and one with grade 3 toxicity)
were taken off study with resolution of toxicity.

RESULTS

Response Data

Patients

Twelve of 50 evaluable patients (24%) achieved SD
≥ 6 months/PR/CR, including 5 patients (10%) with PR/
CR: 9 of 32 patients (28%) with breast cancer (cases 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 12, Table 2); 2 of 10 patients (22%)

with ovarian cancer (cases 7 and 11, Table 2); and 1 of
6 patients (17%) with endometrial cancer (case 8, Table
2). Neither of the 2 patients with cervical cancer achieved
SD≥6 months/PR/CR. Five patients with breast cancer
achieved a PR (cases 3, 4 and 5, Table 2) or CR (cases
1 and 2, Table 2). Three patients with PR included one
patient with a 50% decrease in disease for 11 months (case
3, Table 2), one patient with a 44% decrease in disease for
2 months (case 4, Table 2) and, one with a 38% decrease
in disease for 17+ months (case 5, Table 2). The two
patients (4%) with CRs have ongoing responses at 9+ and
6+ months (cases 1 and 2, Table 2).

A total of 35 patients had molecular testing for
at least one of the following: PIK3CA, PTEN, or AKT1
mutation; and/or PTEN loss. Of the 35 patients tested,
22 (63%) were positive for at least one alteration in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Of 35 patients tested
for an alteration in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 13
were negative. One of 13 patients (8%) attained SD ≥ 6
months/PR/CR (this patient had a CR). By comparison, 22
patients tested had a PI3K pathway alteration; 6 of these
22 patients (27%) had SD≥6 months/PR/CR (2 patients
with PR/CR) (p = 0.16).

DISCUSSION

Prior Treatment with Aromatase Inhibitors and
Response

Hormonal therapy is a mainstay of treatment for
breast cancer and is an area of active investigation in
gynecologic tumors. Strategies to augment response
and overcome resistance to aromatase inhibitors are
urgently needed. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations
are common in breast and gynecologic cancers [2022]. Preclinical studies have shown that suppression of
PTEN function, or activated AKT1 expression, caused
by activating mutations in PIK3CA or AKT1, confers
resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs as well as
hormonal based drugs, but results in sensitivity to mTOR
inhibitors [23, 24]. Recent studies of breast cancer patients
treated with everolimus in combination with exemestane
[8] and of endometrial and breast cancer patients treated
with everolimus in combination with letrozole [9, 10]
have shown efficacy. Based on the Phase III study results,
everolimus is now FDA-approved in combination with the
aromatase inhibitor exemestane in patients with advanced,
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer refractory to
anastrozole and/or letrozole [8].
Our study indicates that the combination of
anastrozole and everolimus can be given at full approved
doses. Tolerance was excellent with the main side effects
being grade 1 and 2 mucositis, fatigue, nausea/vomiting/
anorexia and, grade 3 mucositis. Two patients experienced
DLTs, mucositis in both cases. A dose reduction resulted
in better tolerance in one patient and the other patient was
taken off study. These results parallel those for exemestane
[8] and letrozole [9, 10]; these hormone antagonists can be
given safely with full dose everolimus (10 mg PO daily).
Herein we report that 6 of 8 patients (75%) who
experienced SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR (3 patients with PR/
CR) on this study and on whom molecular testing was
performed, demonstrated at least one alteration in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Six of 22 patients (27%) with
molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR, including 2 patients (9%)
with PR/CR. Our results support and expand on those
previously reported [21, 25]. Indeed, 12 of 50 heavily
pretreated patients (24%) with breast or gynecologic
tumors achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR with anastrozole
and everolimus, including 5 patients (10%) with PR/CR.

Twenty-three of 50 evaluable patients (46%) had
received at least one prior aromatase inhibitor in the
advanced or metastatic setting. Five of the 23 patients
(22%) who had been previously treated in the metastatic
setting with an aromatase inhibitor achieved SD ≥ 6
months/PR/CR with the combination of anastrozole
and everolimus, including 3 patients (13%) with PR/
CR. Twenty of 32 patients (63%) with breast cancer
had received prior aromatase inhibitors in the advanced
or metastatic setting. Five of the 20 patients (25%) with
breast cancer and prior aromatase inhibitor exposure
achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR (3 patients with PR/CR).

Molecular Analysis and Association with Response
When archival cell blocks for patients were
available, CLIA-certified molecular testing was performed
for PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway alterations. For the
purposes of this study, we defined a PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway alteration as one or more of the following:
PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN mutation, and/or PTEN loss
(by IHC). Of the 12 patients who demonstrated SD ≥
6 months/PR/CR, 8 had molecular testing (3 of 5 with
PR/CR). Six of the 8 patients (75%) had at least one
alteration in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway including
PIK3CA mutations (3 patients, one of whom also had an
AKT1 mutation) and PTEN loss (IHC) (3 patients). The
remaining two patients (25%) with molecular testing did
not have a direct alteration in this pathway. Three patients
who achieved PR/CR who also had molecular testing with
NGS demonstrated additional alterations: amplifications
in FGFR1 (encodes for fibroblast growth factor receptor
1, 2 patients), CCND1 (encodes for cyclin D1, also known
as BCL1, 2 patients), CCNE1 (encodes for cyclin E1, 1
patient), IRS2 (encodes for insulin receptor substrate 2,
1 patient), MCL1 (myeloid leukemia cell gene, 1 patient)
and MYC (myelocytomatosis viral oncogene, 1 patient)
and, a re-arrangement in PRKDC (protein kinase DNA
activated catalytic polypeptide, 1 patient).

presence does not rule out response.  
A total of 3 patients who achieved PR/CR had NGS
testing. These patients demonstrated numerous alterations
including: CCNE1, CCND1, FGFR1, IRS2, MCL1,
and MYC amplifications and a PRKDC re-arrangement,
as well as TP53 mutations (cases 1, 3 and 5, Table 2).
CCNE1 and CCND1 code for cyclin D1 and cyclin E1,
respectively, which are proteins that help control the
transition of cells from G1 to S phase during proliferation
[27]. Both of these proteins are regulated by GSK-3β,
which is directly phosphorylated by AKT [28]. MYC
is a regulator gene that codes for a transcription factor
involved in cell proliferation and is also directly regulated
by GSK-3β [29]. Insulin receptor substrates (IRS1 and
IRS2) are proteins that dock to IGFR receptors to recruit
other factors such as the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K,
thereby leading to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway [30]. Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR)
bind to growth factors (FGF) involved in angiogenesis.
Activation of FGFR induces PI3K and AKT activities
through recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of the
docking protein Gab1 that results in the activation of PI3K
[31]. MCL1 codes for a protein that enhances cell survival
by inhibiting apoptosis. Control of MCL1 stability by
GSK-3β is an important mechanism for the regulation of
apoptosis by AKT [32]. Tumor Protein 53 (TP53) codes
for a tumor suppressor (p53) that regulates cell cycle. AKT
influences the activity of p53 through phosphorylation
of the p53-binding protein MDM2 [33]. Protein kinase,
DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide (PRKDC) codes for
a catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, a
member of the PI3K family [34]. The presence of multiple
gene aberrations may reflect increased genetic instability
and poor patient prognosis [35]; however, the combination
of anastrozole and everolimus was beneficial for each of
these three patients. One of the patients with a durable
CR (case 1, Table 2) had NGS testing and demonstrated
a TP53 mutation as well as amplifications in CCNE1,
IRS2, a protein important for insulin receptor signaling
[36], and MCL1, a gene that plays a role in regulating
cell-fate decisions [37]. The latter results suggest that
CR can be achieved in the absence of a direct alteration
in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, even when multiple
molecular aberrations are present. However, some of the
above genes may modulate the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR
axis perhaps explaining in part the response [31, 38-43].
Systems biology bioinformatics approaches will be needed
to determine whether or not multiple aberrant signals in
patients with metastatic tumors converge on pathways
such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and are hence
actionable.
Our results suggest that patients can obtain salutary
effects including CR (and PR) despite the presence of
multiple alterations; however, should relapse occur
in any of these patients, it might be explained by the
additional alterations eventually leading to resistance.

These results are consistent with the SD ≥ 6 months/PR/
CR rates of 20 to 30% previously reported by our group
in patients treated with matched phase I therapy [21,
25]. Our response rates are slightly higher than those
reported in Bolero-2 [8], but our patient numbers are also
smaller. Further, some of our patients with breast cancer
did not receive prior aromatase inhibitors. The number
of patients with endometrial cancer are small, but the
observed activity is lower than reported in the letrozole/
everolimus combination in this tumor type [9]. Regarding
correlation with molecular aberrations, we found that
six of eight responders tested had pathway aberrations.
These aberrations included abnormalities in PIK3CA,
PTEN and AKT, consistent with the diversity of genes
that can activate the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR pathway.  On
the other hand, only 27% of patients with these pathway
abnormalities responded.  These data are consistent with
data recently presented by Hortobagyi et al. [26], where
patients with either no or only one molecular aberration in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway had better outcomes with
exemestane and everolimus than did patients with multiple
aberrations. On the other hand, three of our patients with
CR or PR showed multiple aberrations indicating that their

that are not located in hotspot regions frequently tested
[47]. We also had molecular data from only one time point;
pre- and post-tissue analyses would be more informative
to elucidate resistance patterns. Future investigations
should emphasize molecular analysis so that biological
correlates of clinical response can be identified. Finally,
our patient numbers were relatively small. Therefore, these
results must be interpreted in this context and considered
hypothesis generating.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that full doses
of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole and the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus can be given for prolonged periods of
time (longest so far = 17 months) with excellent tolerance.
A subset of heavily pretreated patients with breast, ovarian
and endometrial cancer achieved SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR.
SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR was seen in 27% of patients with
molecular alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Patients with multiple molecular alterations still benefited
from therapy. Further exploration of this combination
in larger cohorts of patients with breast and gynecologic
tumors and in-depth analysis of molecular correlates is
warranted.

It is not surprising that patients with advanced disease
have multiple molecular alterations, as this observation is
consistent with previous literature reports of heterogeneity
within and between tumors [44-46].
There are several limitations to our study. Whether
the responses observed are due simply to the inhibition
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by everolimus or due
to hormone modulation by aromatase inhibition alone
(especially in those patients not previously treated with
anastrozole) or contribution from both is unknown, as
this was not a randomized study. However, it should be
noted that the rate of SD ≥ 6 months/PR/CR was similar
in patients who had failed prior aromatase inhibition
therapy (5 of 23 patients, 22%) versus those who had not
had aromatase inhibition (7 of 27 patients, 26%), which
suggests that everolimus contributed to those responses.
Another potential limitation of this analysis is that a
majority of our patients had breast cancer, and that the
combination of an aromatase inhibitor and an mTOR
inhibitor has recently been demonstrated to be effective.
However, we provide correlative molecular data and
show responses in endometrial and ovarian cancers, as
well as breast cancer. Further, we show that the activity in
breast cancer is seen with anastrozole and therefore is not
limited to exemestane (as used in previous studies) [8].
Additional limitations of our study stem from the fact that
only a subset of patients had next generation sequencing.
Furthermore, comparison of MD Anderson CLIA
“hotspot” testing versus next generation sequencing was
also performed in only limited number of patients. It is
possible that other mutations exist in some of the patients
tested by “hotspot” analysis, and were not discerned by
this type of testing. As an example, a recent study in breast
cancers has identified additional driver mutations in AKT1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
The study enrolled adult patients with
pathologically-confirmed advanced or metastatic
cancer. Patients were required to have tumors that
demonstrated ER and/or PR-positive disease (positivity by
immunohistochemistry staining ≥ 1% based on reported
guidelines for breast cancer) [14]. For women, only
those who were postmenopausal or premenopausal and
receiving a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist were
eligible. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2. Other
criteria included adequate neutrophil counts (≥ 1,000/mL),
platelets (≥ 50,000/mL), creatinine (≤ 2 × upper limit of
normal), bilirubin (≤ 2.0), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) (≤ 3 × upper limit of normal with the exception of
patients with liver metastasis in whom ALT ≤ 5 × upper
limit of normal and bilirubin ≤ 3 × upper limit of normal).
Patients provided written informed consent according to
institutional guidelines. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Study Design and Treatment
This was a single institution, open-label, doseescalation study, with a standard 3+3 design. The study
allowed an additional (optional) three patients at any dose
level in order to provide flexibility for enrollment and
additional safety or correlative data. Endpoints were to
3034

Oncotarget

establish safety and preliminarily assess antitumor efficacy
and molecular correlates.
Each treatment cycle was 28-days with both drugs
given daily. Cycles were consecutive with no treatment
breaks. Patients were initially treated at dose level 1
(anastrozole 1 mg PO daily and everolimus 5 mg PO
daily) and if no serious toxicities were observed the dose
was escalated to dose level 2 (anastrozole 1 mg PO daily
and everolimus 10 mg PO daily). Dose level 2 represents
the full approved dose of each drug. Once the safety of
dose level 2 was established, additional patients were
enrolled at that level.
If a response was observed in a particular tumor
subtype, study cohorts were expanded to include up to
an additional 14 participants with that specific tumor
type. For the purpose of adding up to 14 additional
participants, a tumor (including, but not limited to tumor
type, histologic subtype or genomic subtype) response was
defined as one of the following: (1) stable disease (SD) ≥
6 months; or (2) decrease in measurable tumors ≥ 20% by
RECIST criteria.

Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at MD Anderson.
Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
or tissue from fine-needle aspiration or surgical biopsies
were used for mutational analysis. DNA was extracted
and analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based DNA sequencing method for PIK3CA mutations in
codons [c] 532-554 of exon 9 (helical domain) and c10111062 of exon 20 (kinase domain) [15], which included
the mutation hot spot region of the PIK3CA protooncogene by Sanger sequencing following amplification
of 276 bp and 198 bp amplicons, respectively, utilizing
primers designed at MD Anderson. For AKT1 and PTEN
mutations, similar methods were used. Codons 17, 1173,
and 179 were examined for AKT1 mutations, and for
PTEN, the entire coding sequence of exons 1 through 9
were examined as previously described [16]. PTEN loss
was assessed using a Dako antibody (Carpinteria, CA,
USA) as previously published [16, 17].

Evaluation of HER2/neu amplification, estrogen
and progesterone receptor status

Assessment of Safety and Efficacy

Under CLIA conditions, immunohistochemistry was
used to measure of HER2/neu, estrogen and progesterone
receptors. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were
assessed using antibody 6F11 (Novocastra Laboratories,
Ltd., Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK). Alternatively,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to
measure the copy number of HER2/neu.

Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or
disease progression occurred. Dose delays and reductions
were at the discretion of the treating physician. Toxicities
were graded based on the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). Dose limiting
toxicities (DLTs) were defined as adverse events (AEs)
related to study agents that occurred during the first cycle
of treatment with an attribution of possible, probable,
or definitely related to therapy and fulfilling one of the
following requirements: grade 4 neutropenia lasting >
7 days, febrile neutropenia, platelet count <25,000/mm
lasting >7 days, any grade 4 or toxicity, any grade 3
toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless
it persisted despite optimal treatment).
Responses were assessed after three cycles (about
12 weeks) or earlier at the discretion of the treating
physician. All radiological tests were assessed by an MD
Anderson radiologist. In addition, results were reviewed
in a departmental tumor measurement clinic and by the
attending physician. RECIST criteria were used for
progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial and
complete responses (PR and CR).

Next-Generation Sequencing
Genomic libraries were captured for 3230 exons in
182 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes
often rearranged in cancer and sequenced to average
median depth of 734× with 99% of bases covered >100×
(Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics are provided for all endpoints
using SPSS v.19 (Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous
measurements were summarized using mean, standard
deviation, median, range, number of patients, and
percentages. Time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall
survival were calculated using the method of Kaplan and
Meier [18, 19] in months, from date of first treatment
dose to the date of last treatment dose or death from any
cause, whichever came first. Patients still on study at the
time of data analysis were censored at the time of last
assessment for TTF. For survival, patients still alive at
the time of analysis were censored at that time point. A
three-dimensional waterfall plot depicting best RECIST
responses by percent and time on therapy is presented in
