Visualizing Inhibition of Nucleosome Mobility and
Transcription by Cisplatin–DNA Interstrand Crosslinks
in Live Mammalian Cells
Guangyu Zhu1,2, Lina Song1, and Stephen J. Lippard1

Abstract
Cisplatin is a widely used anticancer drug that acts by binding DNA and causing the formation of intrastrand
and interstrand (ICL) crosslinks, but the precise downstream effects of the latter damage are not well understood.
In this study, we investigated the inﬂuence of cisplatin ICLs on synthetic nucleosomes that were platinated in a
site-speciﬁc manner in vitro and on gene transcription in live mammalian cells. Nucleosome core particles that we
constructed contained site-speciﬁc cisplatin 50 -d(G pC)/50 -d(G pC) ICLs, where the asterisk denotes the
platinated nucleoside, to examine the inﬂuence of platinum lesions on the dynamic behavior of nucleosomes
in solution. A cisplatin ICL, but not a 1,2-d(GpG) crosslink, signiﬁcantly inhibited ATP-independent histone
octamer-DNA sliding. We also used a novel linearization-recircularization strategy described here to synthesize
mammalian expression vectors containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICLs. Plasmid vectors were tested in live
mammalian cells to study the transcription inhibition effects of cisplatin ICLs in the context of two different
repair backgrounds. Cisplatin ICLs inhibit transcription as effectively as 1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks. We determined
that nucleotide excision repair plays a key role in the removal of cisplatin ICLs, acting in a replication-independent
fashion. We also found that loss of mismatch repair function dramatically attenuates the transcription inhibition
effects by cisplatin ICLs but not 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks. Our results revealed the unique properties of
cisplatin ICLs on nucleosome mobility and on transcription, and they deﬁned how these adducts act in a manner
completely different from that used for cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks. These new ﬁndings provide direct support
for a role of ICLs in the pharmacologic activities of cisplatin, despite the lower frequency of their formation. Cancer

Introduction
Platinum-based chemotherapy has been successfully used
to treat various types of cancer (1–3). U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved platinum drugs, including cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)], oxaliplatin [(R,R-1,2diaminocyclohexane)oxalatoplatinum(II)], and carboplatin [cisdiammine(1,10 -cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II)] (Fig. 1),
bind DNA and form adducts that block transcription
and ultimately induce apoptosis (4–6). The major DNA
adducts formed by cisplatin are cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ 1,2-d(GpG)
and –d(ApG) intrastrand crosslinks, and minor adducts
include 1,3-d(GpNpG) intrastrand crosslinks and 50 -d(GpC)/
50 -d(GpC) interstrand crosslinks (ICL). How the cells proAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute

cess cisplatin–DNA intrastrand crosslinks has been extensively studied (7).
In eukaryotes, DNA wraps around histone octamers forming
nucleosomes, the fundamental building blocks of chromatin
(8). Cisplatin binds both free and nucleosomal DNA (9).
Determining the consequences of platinum–DNA adduct formation at the nucleosome level is an important step in
understanding the details of cellular recognition of platinum
drugs and of transcription stalling. With the use of DNA probes
containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin lesions, hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments revealed that a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) or a
1,3-d(GpTpG) intrastrand crosslink overrides the rotational
setting predeﬁned in a nucleosome positioning sequence. The
lesions face inward, toward the histone core, and affect the
translational positioning of the DNA (10–12).
Cisplatin ICLs induce profound structural changes in free
DNA duplexes and display a proﬁle of binding to cellular
proteins and a repair mechanism that is distinct from those
of intrastrand crosslinks (13–17). Relatively little is known
about the effects of ICLs at the nucleosome level. Cisplatin
forms ICLs on nucleosomal DNA, with the level of crosslinking
decreasing near the nucleosome dyad (18). Other ICL-forming
chemotherapeutic agents, such as nitrogen mustards and
mitomycin C, also crosslink DNA at levels that diminish near
the dyad (19). Minor groove DNA-binding agents such as

on nucleosome mobility and transcription were discovered,
revealing that, although cisplatin ICLs represent a small portion of Pt-DNA crosslinks, their cellular processing is completely different from that of the more abundant cisplatin 1,2intrastrand crosslinks.

pyrrole-imidazole polyamides block temperature-induced histone octamer repositioning and inhibit transcription by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (20, 21).
The transcription inhibition effects of cisplatin intrastrand
crosslinks have been extensively explored in both in vitro
reconstituted systems and live mammalian cells (22). To obtain
site-speciﬁcally platinated mammalian expression vectors for
the latter studies, a "gapping" strategy was used to incorporate
cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks within the multiple cloning site
of a Gaussia luciferase plasmid, pGLuc (23). The plasmid was
used to investigate transcription inhibition at cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks in live mammalian cells (24). Subsequently,
pGLuc containing a site-speciﬁc Pt-DNA lesion by a monofunctional platinum compound, pyriplatin [cis-diammine(pyridine)chloroplatinum(II)], was synthesized and its transcription inhibition effects and repair mechanism were evaluated
(25). The "gapping" strategy is, however, not applicable for the
synthesis of plasmids containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICLs.
Although their frequency is relatively low, cisplatin ICLs
have long been a topic of interest (26). For instance, despite
their limited occurrence, ICLs have the potential to be the most
critical cisplatin lesions. ICLs have been associated with cisplatin resistance arising from gene-speciﬁc repair (17). Despite
efforts to understand the cellular recognition and processing of
cisplatin ICLs, their repair mechanism(s) in mammalian systems are not well established. Transcription inhibition studies
in vitro reveal that cisplatin ICLs signiﬁcantly stall both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases at the site of damage
(27).
To probe the effects of cisplatin ICLs at the level of the
nucleosome, we posed the following questions. What differences, if any, are there in the properties of nucleosomes
containing DNA having a site-speciﬁc cisplatin intrastrand
versus an interstrand crosslink? To what extent do cisplatin
ICLs inhibit transcription in live mammalian cells? Do cisplatin
intrastrand versus interstrand DNA crosslinks differ in their
abilities to disrupt transcription? Is transcription-coupled
repair the same for the two types of adduct? To address these
questions, we constructed site-speciﬁcally modiﬁed nucleosomes containing a cisplatin ICL or a 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand
crosslink. Nucleosomes lacking platinum damage were used as
a control. We compared the mobility of nucleosomes containing the different cisplatin–DNA crosslinks. In addition, we
established a novel linearization–recircularization strategy to
synthesize plasmids containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICLs, and
the plasmids were applied in transcription assays to reveal the
transcription inhibition effects of ICLs in a variety of live

Enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and
chemicals and solvents from commercial sources unless speciﬁed otherwise. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a HP 8453
spectrometer. Platinum analysis was conducted by ﬂameless
atomic absorption spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer AAnalyst
600 system. Analytic and preparative high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) was run on an Agilent 1200 HPLC
system. SequaGel concentrate used in the preparation of
the denaturing polyacrylamide gels was purchased from
National Diagnostics. Oligonucleotide properties were calculated online (http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/
OligoCalc.html). PAGE was conducted on either a Life Technologies S2 sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus or a
Protean II xi cell from Bio-Rad. Electrophoresis gels with
radioactive samples were dried and documented on a Storm
840 Phosphorimager system from Amersham/GE Healthcare
or exposed wet to a Kodak Biomax MS ﬁlm. Radioactive
samples were quantiﬁed on a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation
counter. Agarose gel electrophoreses containing 0.5 mg/mL
ethidium bromide were imaged using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager. A QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit was purchased from
Qiagen. HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. U2OS-MOCK and XPF-1128 cells were
supplied by Dr. Nora Graf (Department of Chemistry at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA). HEC59
and HEC59þChr2 cells were obtained from Dr. Thomas Kunkel
(NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Synthesis of platinated oligonucleotides for the
construction of 146 bp DNA duplexes
The small DNA duplexes containing a cisplatin ICL or
1,2-d(GpG) crosslink were synthesized and puriﬁed by HPLC
following the protocol reported previously (14, 28). The platinated 21-mer strands were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and a nuclease S1
digestion assay (data not shown). The cisplatin ICL was characterized by 12% PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S2) and stored in
0.1 mol/L NaClO4 at 80 C.
Preparation of 146 bp DNA duplexes
63-Mer, 57-mer, 62-mer, and 56-mer oligonucleotides were
chemically synthesized and puriﬁed by 8% preparative denaturing PAGE. The puriﬁed strands were quantiﬁed by UV-vis
spectroscopy. The strands were also radiolabeled with [g-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and revealed on an 8%
denaturing gel to conﬁrm their purity (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Sequences are provided in Supplementary Fig. S4. A 300 pmol
quantity of each oligonucleotide was ﬁrst phosphorylated
with ATP or [g-32P]-ATP by T4 PNK (20 U) at 37 C for 1.5

phenol extraction. The oligonucleotides were then ethanol
precipitated. The large duplexes were prepared (Supplementary Fig. S5) by annealing 63-mer and 57-mer, 62-mer and 56mer, separately, in 50 mL of annealing buffer containing 100
mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, pH 7.4,
in a temperature gradient of 95 C to 4 C over 8 hours. A 20
pmol quantity of each of the 21-mer/33-mer duplexes was then
annealed with 40 pmol of the 2 large duplexes (Supplementary
Fig. S5) in annealing buffer using a temperature gradient
of 37 C to 4 C over 2 hours. The buffer was adjusted to
100 mmol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 20 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 1 mmol/L ATP, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 800 mL
supplemented with 4 U of T4 DNA ligase. The ligation was
carried out at 16 C overnight and the enzyme was deactivated
by heat and removed by phenol extraction. The volume of the
mixture was reduced by ethanol precipitation and the ligation
products were puriﬁed and characterized by a 5% denaturing
PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Puriﬁcation of native oligonucleosomes
High molecular weight chromatin from HeLa cells was
isolated and oligonucleosomes with linker histone depletion
were prepared as reported previously (11). The purity of the
oligonucleosomes was conﬁrmed by a 1.5% native agarose gel
and a 12% SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Nucleosome reconstitution
Nucleosome reconstitution experiments were carried out as
reported previously (11). Details are reported in the Supplementary Information section.
Vector construction and preparation
An unreplicable mammalian vector expressing Gaussia
luciferase, pGLuc, was derived from pCMV-GLuc as reported
previously (23). The backbone for construction of Gaussia
luciferase plasmids containing site-speciﬁc platinum-DNA
1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks, pGLuc4temGG, was derived from
pGLuc plasmid as described previously (23). Another Gaussia
luciferase plasmid for subsequent incorporation of a sitespeciﬁc cisplatin ICL, designated as pGLuc-Bsm2, was prepared by insertion of a heteroduplex oligonucleotide, 50 AGCTTGAGCGGTACCAGGGAGAGACG/50 -GATCCGTCTCTCCCTGGTACCGCTCA, between the HindIII and BamHI sites
of pGLuc. This modiﬁed plasmid contains unique HindIII
and BsmBI restriction sites for the incorporation of a cisplatin
ICL between the CMV promoter and Gaussia luciferase gene
(Fig. 4).
Preparation of insertion strands for site-speciﬁcally
modiﬁed plasmids
A 15-bp DNA duplex containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL,
50 -AGCTGGAGAAGAG CAAGAG/50 -CCCTCTCTTG CTCTTCTCC, where the asterisks denote the platinated bases, was
synthesized as reported previously (Fig. 4; ref. 14).
Preparation of site-speciﬁcally platinated pGLuc probes
Synthesis of the Gaussia luciferase expression vector containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL, pGLuc9temGþICL, was

carried out using a linearization–recircularization strategy
(Fig. 5). A 700 mg quantity of pGLuc-Bsm2 was digested with
700 units of HindIII at 37 C for 2 hours. The resulting linear
plasmid was puriﬁed by isopycnic centrifugation at 58,000 rpm,
20 C for 24 hours with a CsCl gradient containing 120 mg/mL
ethidium bromide to separate the linearized plasmid from its
circular form. The fraction containing the linearized plasmid
was extracted under UV shadowing, and ethidium bromide
was removed by 3 n-butanol extraction steps. An ethanol
precipitation step was conducted to reduce the ﬁnal volume,
and the linearized pGLuc-Bsm2 was stored at 20 C. Next, an
80 mg quantity of puriﬁed linearized plasmid was ligated with
100 equiv of phosphorylated 15 bp duplex containing a sitespeciﬁc cisplatin ICL in ligation buffer containing 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L ATP. This
buffer was prepared without dithiothreitol, which could potentially interact with the platinum atom. The mixture was heated
at 37 C for 10 minutes and kept at 4 C for 10 minutes. T4 DNA
ligase (320 units) was added to the ﬁnal mixture, which was
incubated at 16 C overnight. The excess amount of 15 bp ICL
insertion strands was subsequently removed with a QIAquick
PCR puriﬁcation kit. The plasmid was further digested with
200 units of BsmBI at 55 C for 1 hour, and the resulting small
duplex DNA in the solution was removed by the QIAquick
PCR puriﬁcation kit. The recircularization step was carried out
in the presence of 320 units of T4 DNA ligase in a buffer
containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 1 mmol/L ATP at room temperature for 3 hours in a
total volume of 6.0 mL. The ﬁnal product was puriﬁed using
isopycnic centrifugation. The fraction containing the closed
circular form of plasmid was visualized by UV shadowing
and extracted. Ethidium bromide was removed by n-butanol
extraction, and the plasmids were ethanol precipitated and
stored in TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
pH 7.4). The plasmid containing a site-speciﬁc ICL is designated as pGLuc9temGþICL. A control plasmid containing
unplatinated small duplex insertion strand, designated as
pGLuc9temGþIS, was prepared as well. The DNA concentrations were determined by a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
kit (Invitrogen). The yields from linearized plasmids range
from 2% to 5%. The pGLuc plasmid containing site-speciﬁc
cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks and the control plasmid
with no platinum were synthesized according to a published
protocol (23).
Transient transfection of cells and GLuc reporter
transcription assays
Transient transfection of different mammalian cells and
GLuc reporter transcription assays were carried out following
protocols published previously (25).

Synthesis of site-speciﬁcally platinated nucleosomes
To build site-speciﬁcally modiﬁed nucleosomes containing
different platinum lesions, we adopted the sequence used
previously in our laboratory to study the structure of nucleosomal DNA containing a cisplatin 1,3-d(GpTpG) crosslink
(10). This sequence has a moderate afﬁnity for histone

octamers and does not form a well-positioned nucleosome
(10). To synthesize 146-bp DNAs containing site-speciﬁc platinum lesions, small 21-mer/33-mer duplexes containing a
cisplatin ICL or a cisplatin intrastrand crosslink were ﬁrst
prepared and puriﬁed (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). The
larger strands, 63-mer, 57-mer, 62-mer, and 56-mer, were
synthesized, puriﬁed, and characterized by a 12% denaturing
PAGE to conﬁrm their purity (Supplementary Fig. S3;
sequences shown in Supplementary Fig. S4). The 63-mer and
57-mer, and the 62-mer and 56-mer, were annealed in a
pairwise fashion to obtain the larger duplexes, which were
then annealed and ligated with the small duplexes to yield sitespeciﬁc 146 bp strands (Supplementary Fig. S5). During this
process, [g-32P]-ATP was used to label the 50 -end of the 63-mer
so that, in the ﬁnal products, the duplexes were radiolabeled on
the top strand. The synthesized site-speciﬁc 146 bp strands
were characterized on a 5% denaturing gel (Supplementary Fig.
S6). The duplex containing a cisplatin ICL had reduced migration, conﬁrming the presence of a site-speciﬁc ICL. When the
ICL was treated with NaCN, the platinum link was removed,
converting the duplex into 146-mer strands having the same
migration as duplexes containing no platinum (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Native oligonucleosomes containing core histones
with linker histone depletion from HeLa cells were puriﬁed
(Supplementary Fig. S7; ref. 11). First, we transferred the
labeled duplexes with or without a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL
to donor chromatin having more than 3 nucleosomes, 2 to 3
nucleosomes, or 1 to 2 nucleosomes. The transfer efﬁciency for
the centered, radiolabeled forms of the nucleosome core
particle (NCP) assembly and off-centered NCP assembly was
similar when different sizes of chromatin were used (Supplementary Fig. S8). We therefore used donor chromatin having
2 to 3 nucleosomes in the following assays.

Effects of cisplatin ICLs on nucleosome repositioning
When the NCP samples were heated at 45 C for 2 hours,
most of the off-centered NCPs containing no platinum shifted
to form centered NCPs. NCPs containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL were, however, unable to be heat shifted to form
centered NCPs, indicating that a cisplatin ICL alters nucleosome mobility (Supplementary Fig. S8). We next examined, in
much greater detail, the inﬂuence of a cisplatin ICL on the
dynamic behavior of nucleosomes in solution by testing its
effect on nucleosome repositioning induced by heating. NCPs
containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL, a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG)
crosslink, or no platinum were compared. The samples were
heat shifted at 37 C or 45 C for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hours. The
same amount of sample was loaded in each lane of a native
polyacrylamide gel to compare the percent of centered and offcentered NCPs. At 37 C, the majority of the NCPs were in the
centered, thermodynamically stable form after 1 hour when the
core particle contained either no platinum or a site-speciﬁc
cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) crosslink, and most of the off-centered
NCPs were transformed back to centered NCPs after 3 hours
(Fig. 2). The shift process was faster at 45 C, where the majority
of the NCPs containing a 1,2-d(GpG) crosslink or no platinum
were in the centered form after 0.5 hours (Supplementary Fig.
S9). The nucleosome containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICL,
however, displayed a dramatically different nucleosome mobility proﬁle. First, upon the assembly of nucleosome containing
an ICL, there are a greater number off-centered NCPs (from
55% to 60%) compared with nucleosomes containing a 1,2-d
(GpG) crosslink or no crosslink (from 40% to 50%). Second,
heat shifting converted only a small portion of off-centered
to centered nucleosomes, even after 3 hours, at both 37 C
and 45 C. The transfer speed was higher at the higher temperature, but still a large portion of the nucleosomes remained

A quantitative analysis of the inﬂuence of different platinum

Fig. 3.
Construction of pGLuc containing site-speciﬁc ICLs
We used pGLuc as the vector for the incorporation of an ICL
between the CMV promoter and GLuc expression gene to
investigate the transcription inhibition effects of ICLs in live
mammalian cells (Fig. 4). HindIII and BsmBI restriction sites
were cloned into pGLuc plasmids, designated as pGLuc-Bsm2.
A 15 bp heteroduplex oligonucleotide containing a site-speciﬁc
ICL with 50 -HindIII and 50 -BsmBI overhangs was inserted into
the pGLuc-Bsm2 plasmid between the HindIII and BsmBI sites.
The resulting plasmids were designated as pGLuc9temGþIS
and pGLuc9temGþICL, for unplatinated control and sitespeciﬁcally platinated ICL plasmids, respectively.
The overall strategy for constructing a site-speciﬁc ICL
plasmid is given in Fig. 5. The acceptor plasmid pGLuc-Bsm2
was ﬁrst linearized by digestion with HindIII and then puriﬁed
(Fig. 5A and B). A 100-fold molar excess of the phosphorylated
heteroduplex oligonucleotide containing a site-speciﬁc ICL, as
shown in Fig. 4, was annealed to the linearized pGLuc-Bsm2 in
the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Because these oligos contain a
50 -AGCT overhang complementary to the HindIII-generated
ends, they could be annealed to the linearized pGLuc-Bsm2 in
a speciﬁc direction. This is a dead-end reaction because the
HindIII ligation site was eliminated after the addition of the

heteroduplex, with the resulting linearized plasmid containing
two 50 -CCCT overhangs that could not be annealed and ligated
to form a circularized plasmid. The excess amount of small
oligos was eliminated. The next step required removal of the
platinated heteroduplex oligonucleotide from one end of the
plasmid to generate a ligation-competent plasmid end suitable
for recircularization (Fig. 5C). In the current design, the
heteroduplex contains a 50 -CCCT overhang complementary
to that generated by BsmBI digestion. We used size exclusion
chromatography to remove the smaller DNA fragments
because they could potentially affect the subsequent annealing
and ligation steps (Fig. 5D). This puriﬁed linear plasmid
contains a 50 -CCCT overhang from the inserted small oligo
and a 50 -AGGG overhang from the BsmBI digestion, and it
could therefore be closed by T4 DNA ligase. The ligation was
carried out at low plasmid concentrations to favor formation of
circular products by intramolecular rather than intermolecular
reactions, thereby avoiding the formation of multimers (Fig.
5E). The ﬁnal site-speciﬁc circular plasmid, pGLuc9temGþICL,
was puriﬁed by isopycnic ultracentrifugation (Fig. 5f). With this
strategy, a heteroduplex oligonucleotide containing a sitespeciﬁc cisplatin ICL could be incorporated into the pGLuc
plasmid in a speciﬁc direction. In parallel, we synthesized a
control plasmid incorporating a heteroduplex oligonucleotide
containing no platinum, designated pGLuc9temGþIS. Restriction digestion analysis of the synthesized and puriﬁed plasmids
(Supplementary Fig. S10) conﬁrmed their purity and the
successful incorporation of an ICL.
Transcription inhibition at cisplatin ICLs in NERproﬁcient and -deﬁcient cells
We next studied the transcription inhibition at cisplatin
ICLs in live mammalian cells. The pGLuc9temGþICL plasmid was used in a transcription assay using osteosarcoma
cancer cells with downregulation of XPF gene expression
(XPF1128) and with control cells (U2OS-mock). The detailed protocol for this transcription assay has been described previously (25). Brieﬂy, the cells were transfected

presence of site-speciﬁc platinum crosslinks was normalized to that of unplatinated controls at different time points
in U2OS-mock and XPF1128 cells. Results assembled from 3
independent experiments are presented in Fig. 6. A cisplatin
ICL strongly inhibited transcription in both cell lines, at a
level comparable with that of the cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG)
crosslink. Transcription recovery was observed for all the
plasmids over 72 hours in both cell lines, indicating repair
of the platinum crosslinks during this time period. Measurably greater transcription inhibition was observed for both
a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) crosslink and an ICL in XPF-knockdown cells. The transcription levels in the presence of a
cisplatin ICL were 44.6%, 66.3%, and 68.3% in U2OS-mock
cells, and the levels were 36.3%, 54.7%, and 58.9% in XPF1128 cells at 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. The present
data conﬁrm that cisplatin ICLs strongly inhibit transcription in live mammalian cells and that XPF has a role in the
repair of cisplatin ICLs.

with HEC59 (MMR-deﬁcient) and HEC59þChr2 (MMR-proﬁcient) human endometrial cancer cell cells as indicated in
Fig. 7. Cisplatin ICLs strongly inhibited transcription in the
MMR-proﬁcient endometrial cancer cells to an extent that
was signiﬁcantly higher than that for cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG)
crosslinks. No signiﬁcant difference of transcription was observed between the 2 cell lines when a site-speciﬁc cisplatin
1,2-d(GpG) crosslink was presented in the pGLuc plasmid.
Transcription inhibition by the cisplatin ICL was clearly stronger in MMR-proﬁcient compared with MMR-deﬁcient cells.
Transcription levels in the presence of a cisplatin ICL were
74.4%, 79.4%, and 79.7% in HEC59 cells, and the levels were
26.4%, 35.2%, and 39.4% in HEC59þChr2 cells at 24, 48, and
72 hours, respectively. These data indicate that MMR has a
role in processing cisplatin ICLs but not 1,2-d(GpG) cross-links
in replication-independent pathways.

site-exposure, ATP-independent histone octamer sliding,
remodeling of chromatin and nucleosomes, and changes in
chromatin higher-order structure regulate DNA accessibility
(30). Damage can be exposed through translocation of
histone octamer along the DNA, allowing full access of
damage-response proteins to the lesion (31). In vivo studies
revealed that cisplatin forms DNA adducts in the promoter
region, inhibiting hormone receptor-dependent chromatin
remodeling and subsequent binding of transcription factors
(32). Our results further shed light on the inﬂuence of
platinum adducts at the nucleosomal level.
A recent paper revealed that global platination by cisplatin or oxaliplatin on 146 bp nucleosomal DNA inhibits
histone octamer-DNA sliding, although the authors claimed
that the platinum adducts in the nucleosome core did not
alter positioning (33). When there was one platinum-DNA
adduct per NCP, either that of cisplatin or oxaliplatin, it did
not signiﬁcantly inhibit DNA-histone sliding. Our results are
in accord with these conclusions if we consider the following. When a 146 bp DNA duplex is globally platinated,
cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks will dominate. We ﬁnd here
that a cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) cross-link only slightly affects
nucleosome mobility. In results previously published by our
laboratory, a site-speciﬁc cisplatin 1,3-d(GpTpG) cross-link
in nucleosomal DNA did not inhibit histone octamer-DNA
sliding at all (34). Here, we ﬁnd that heat shifting of nucleosomal DNA containing a cisplatin ICL does not convert an
off-centered NCP product to a centered product. Thus, it is
cisplatin ICLs rather than intrastrand crosslinks that most
signiﬁcantly inhibit ATP-independent histone octamer-DNA
sliding.
A cisplatin ICL induces larger distortions in native DNA than
those caused by intrastrand crosslinks. Structural studies
reveal that the cis-{Pt(NH3)2}2þ unit in an ICL lies in the minor
groove and that the double helix is locally reversed, forming a
left-handed, Z-DNA structure. Cytosines in the central 50 -GC/
50 -GC motif are no longer paired to guanines but instead are
extruded from the double helix (35, 36). Our results here are
consistent with other ﬁndings that the minor-groove binding
polyamides suppress histone octamer-DNA sliding in the
nucleosome (21). A cisplatin ICL may lock the histone octamer
in a translational position by blocking rotation of the DNA on
the surface of the core particle. This result has implications for

the repair of different cisplatin adducts at the nucleosomal
level. The cisplatin ICL may block its own repair by inhibiting
dynamic site exposure. Because histone–octamer association
inhibits the repair of platinum adducts (37), a cisplatin ICL on
the nucleosome may present greater challenges to the cellular
repair machinery.
Synthesis of plasmid containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin
ICLs
To further elucidate the transcription inhibition effects of
cisplatin ICLs in live mammalian cells, we established a
linearization–recircularization strategy to synthesize plasmid
containing site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICLs. There are advantages
and disadvantages of such an approach, which introduces a
novel design for the direction-speciﬁc incorporation of a
heteroduplex oligonucleotide containing DNA damage. The
same host vector, linearized pGLuc-Bsm2 in this case, can be
used to insert not only site-speciﬁc cisplatin ICLs, but sitespeciﬁc intrastrand crosslinks or any other type of damage as
well. Different numbers of platinum adducts can be incorporated into the same backbone. For the "gapping" strategy that
we published previously (23), different plasmid backbones
have to be cloned and manipulated to incorporate different
platinum–DNA crosslinks, and the "gapping" strategy is not
applicable for the construction of ICL-containing plasmids.
The linearization–recircularization strategy has a relatively
low yield, however, ranging from 2% to 5% in ﬁnal yield from
the linearized plasmid. The "gapping" strategy can provide
yields up to 10%.
Role of NER in the repair of cisplatin–DNA crosslinks
NER is the major pathway for removing cisplatin intrastrand
crosslinks. The role of NER in the repair of cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG)
crosslinks and pyriplatin-DNA lesions has been previously
described (24, 25). A growing body of evidence has shown that
NER may also function in the repair of ICLs. Several NER
components, including XPFERCC1 and RPA, participate in
ICL repair in vitro (38). NER makes dual incisions in E. coli
and yeast, bracketing the ICL on one of the crosslinked strands
to "unhook" the crosslink (39, 40). Other evidence reveals,
however, that NER is dispensable in mammalian ICL repair
(41). Unlike the NER-defective mutants in E. coli and yeast,
the mammalian equivalents are only moderately sensitive to

ICL-forming agents such as mitomycin C (42). Moreover,
biochemical studies have shown that the dual incisions by
mammalian NER do not unhook ICLs (43). These lines of
evidence support the current model in which, instead of
playing a role in the initial steps of ICL repair, NER may help
remove the crosslink following incision/translesion synthesis
(44).
Using the linearization–recircularization strategy, we
constructed plasmids containing a site-speciﬁc cisplatin
50 -d(G pC)/50 -d(G pC) ICL, where the asterisks denote the
platinated deoxynucleosides. The ability of the ICL to inhibit transcription was studied in XPF-knockdown and
XPF-normal cells. We observed stronger transcription inhibition in the XPF-knockdown cells compared with that in
XPF-normal cells, indicating a role for NER in replicationindependent repair of cisplatin ICLs. Our results are in good
agreement with a very recent paper in which transcriptioncoupled, but not global-genome, NER seems to be involved
in the repair of cisplatin ICLs (45).
Role of MMR in the repair of cisplatin–DNA crosslinks
Besides the direct role of MMR in DNA repair, it triggers
apoptosis signaling pathways following platinum–DNA damage (46). MMR, which contributes to cisplatin resistance (47,
48), is involved in eliminating ICLs formed by psoralen in
human cells (49). The role of MMR proteins in processing
cisplatin ICLs has also been investigated. In particular, we
showed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay that hMutSb,
a heterodimer of hMSH2 and hMSH3, binds to a cisplatin ICL
(14). In addition, transcription assays with globally platinated
pGLuc plasmids reveal that the transcription inhibition following cisplatin and pyriplatin damage is greater in hMSH2proﬁcient cells (25). The results from site-speciﬁcally platinated plasmids containing ICLs are in agreement with these
prior results using plasmids globally platinated by cisplatin,
with stronger transcription inhibition occurring in MMR-proﬁcient cells. The MMR apparatus, instead of facilitating removal of cisplatin crosslinks, promotes the transcription inhibition
effects of cisplatin ICLs but not 1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks. For the
ﬁrst time, to the best of our knowledge, we have discovered in
this study that loss of MMR functionality signiﬁcantly attenuates the transcription inhibition effects of cisplatin ICLs,
suggesting that such activity may promote cisplatin resistance.
Thus, cisplatin ICLs rather than 1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks may
contribute more to cisplatin resistance for cells lacking
hMSH2. The role of hMSH2 in blocking transcription of plasmids containing a cisplatin ICL may arise from binding of the
protein at the site of the crosslink, which then could interfere
with Pol II transcription past the lesion.
Cellular processing of cisplatin ICLs and the
pharmacologic properties of cisplatin
It is generally agreed that intrastrand crosslinks contribute
more to the pharmacologic properties of cisplatin than ICLs
owing to their greater abundance. The cellular processing of
cisplatin intrastrand crosslinks has been extensively investigated, revealing nuclear proteins that recognize the damage,
repair pathways that remove it, and the inﬂuence of such

4458

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

crosslinks on DNA metabolism and nucleosome properties.
Compared with other DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics
including nitrogen mustards, psoralen, and mitomycin C,
which mainly form ICLs, cisplatin seems to have a distinctive
mechanism of action owing to the lower frequency of ICL
formation (39). The present work reveals, however, that the
cellular processing of cisplatin ICLs can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the pharmacologic activity of cisplatin. A previous study
reported greater gene-speciﬁc repair efﬁciency of cisplatin
inter- but not intrastrand crosslinks that was linked to cisplatin
resistance (17). Because of their unique structure, however,
cisplatin ICLs are more challenging for the cellular repair
machinery to eliminate. A detailed repair mechanism for ICLs
is not fully worked out, and recent work has identiﬁed replication-dependent repair of ICLs in which the Fanconi anemia
pathway plays a pivotal role (16, 50). Little is known about the
replication-independent repair mechanism of ICLs and their
inﬂuence on nucleosomal DNA. We ﬁnd here that cisplatin
ICLs inhibit DNA-histone sliding and therefore potentially
shield themselves from cellular repair. Cisplatin ICLs strongly
inhibit transcription to an extent not less than that of cisplatin
1,2-d(GpG) crosslinks. NER plays a role, albeit not a signiﬁcant
one, in the replication-independent repair of cisplatin ICLs,
and loss of MMR function greatly attenuates the transcription
inhibition effects of cisplatin ICLs but not 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand crosslinks. These ﬁndings, together with our previously
published work (14), conﬁrm that cisplatin ICLs are uniquely
recognized by nuclear proteins, strongly inhibit transcription
in live mammalian cells, and have special pathways for removal. Owing to these unique properties, we now speculate that
cisplatin ICLs may also contribute signiﬁcantly to the cytotoxicity of cisplatin as well as to cellular resistance to the drug.
The manner by which cells process cisplatin ICLs will therefore
dramatically affect the pharmacologic activity of cisplatin.
More detailed studies of the cellular processing of cisplatin
ICLs, such as an in-depth analysis of replication-dependent
and -independent repair mechanisms at the nucleosome level,
should provide a more complete picture of the mechanism of
action of cisplatin, the "penicillin" of modern chemotherapeutics, and offer information regarding resistance to this drug.
Such information will also guide the design of future generation platinum-based antineoplastic agents with improved
pharmacologic activities and reduced side effects.
