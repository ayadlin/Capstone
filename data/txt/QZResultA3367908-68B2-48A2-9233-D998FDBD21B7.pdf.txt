Abstract
Sp proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors required for the expression of a wide variety
of genes that are critical for development and cell cycle progression. Deregulated expression of certain Sp
proteins is associated with the formation of a variety of human tumors; however, direct evidence that
any given Sp protein is oncogenic has been lacking. Here, we report that Sp2 protein abundance in mice
increases in concert with the progression of carcinogen-induced murine squamous cell carcinomas. Transgenic mice specifically overexpressing murine Sp2 in epidermal basal keratinocytes were highly susceptible
to wound- and carcinogen-induced papillomagenesis. Transgenic animals that were homozygous rather
than hemizygous for the Sp2 transgene exhibited a striking arrest in the epidermal differentiation program,
perishing within 2 weeks of birth. Our results directly support the likelihood that Sp2 overexpression occurring
in various human cancers has significant functional effect. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8507–16. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The Sp family of mammalian transcription factors includes
nine members, Sp1 to Sp9, that share a highly conserved DNAbinding domain (see refs. 1–4 for review). The promoters
of many mammalian genes, including genes controlling cell
cycle progression and development, are regulated by Sp proteins (5, 6). In turn, the activities of Sp proteins are regulated
by a variety of growth-related signal transduction pathways as
well as mechanisms controlling embryonic development (4).
Animals lacking specific Sp proteins exhibit global or tissuespecific defects, suggesting that Sp family members play
essential, nonoverlapping roles in development (3, 4). The
overexpression of a subset of Sp family members has also
been associated with the formation of a variety of human cancers (6, 7). Yet, it remains uncertain whether the deregulated
expression of any given Sp protein is oncogenic.
Although many biochemical and functional properties of
Sp family members have been established, studies focusing

on Sp2 have yielded few insights into its roles in cell and
organismal physiology. The Sp2 DNA-binding domain is the
least conserved (75%) among Sp family members and binds
with high affinity (Kd = 225 pmol/L) to a consensus DNAbinding site (5′-GGGCGGGAC-3′) that is distinct from that
of Sp1 (8–10). Yet, in transient transfection assays, Sp2 only
weakly transactivates promoters carrying consensus Sp2binding sites or well-characterized Sp-dependent promoters
that are readily induced by Sp1 and Sp3 (8, 11). Despite its
widespread expression, little or no soluble Sp2 DNA-binding
activity has been detected in many human and mouse cell
lines (8). Studies using Sp1/Sp2 chimeras have revealed that
the Sp2 transactivation and DNA-binding domains are each
negatively regulated in vitro, and further analyses have shown
that each of these domains carries amino acid sequences
that independently target Sp2 to the nuclear matrix (12).
Recent analyses have shown that Sp2 (a) transcripts are
inherited maternally, (b) is expressed in embryonic and adult
tissues, (c) is essential for the completion of gastrulation,
and (d) transcription is governed by multiple promoters in
a cell- and tissue-specific fashion (11, 13, 14). Deregulation
of Sp2 expression has also been associated with tumorigenesis. Sp2 abundance is increased in human prostate
cancers and correlated directly with pathologic grade (15).
Herein, we report that Sp2 protein abundance is correlated
directly with the progression of murine squamous cell carcinomas induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). To determine
whether Sp2 overexpression is oncogenic or only associated
with tumorigenesis, we created a novel mouse model in
which Sp2 is overexpressed in cells of the epidermal basal
layer via by the bovine keratin 5 promoter. Sp2 overexpression in transgenic hemizygotes induces alopecia, marked

susceptibility to wound-induced neoplasia, and increased
sensitivity to carcinogen-induced skin tumorigenesis. Levels
of Sp2 expression encountered in homozygotes result in
postnatal lethality and a striking depletion of terminally differentiated keratinocytes. These results indicate that Sp2
overexpression in this epidermal compartment inhibits keratinocyte differentiation and sensitizes these cells to woundand carcinogen-induced neoplastic growth.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
COS-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies,
Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% Pipracil at 37°C under
5% CO2.
Animals and generation of transgenic mouse strains
FVB/NJ and K15-EGFP [B6.Cg-Tg(Krt1-15-EGFP)2Cot/J]
animals were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and
maintained under standard conditions. A transgene construct
carrying the bovine keratin 5 promoter and an epitope-tagged
mouse Sp2 cDNA was prepared in plasmid pTG1 (a gift
from the University of North Carolina Animal Models Core
Facility). The bovine keratin 5 promoter was amplified from
plasmid 383 (a kind gift from Dr. Angel Ramirez, Department
of Epithelial Biology, CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain) via the PCR
using Titanium Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech, Inc.) and
gene-specific primers (5′-ggggcggccgcgatcaaatgcctggtgcaca-3′
and 5′-ggggtcgacccgaggtgctggagagaaag-3′). This promoter
was subcloned upstream of a splice donor sequence derived
from the first exon of the mouse albumin gene. A fulllength, epitope-tagged [Influenza hemagglutinin (HA)]
mouse Sp2 cDNA was isolated via reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) using total mouse heart RNA as a template
as reported elsewhere (13). The nucleotide sequence of this
cDNA has been deposited in GenBank (accession number
GU126673). An HA-epitope tag was appended at the 3′
end of mouse Sp2-coding sequences via the PCR using
Titanium Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech) and gene-specific
primers (5′-gaattcagatccgccaccatgagcgcagatccacagatga-3′
and 5′-cccacctaggcacgaagggcttgtacccatacgatgttccagattacgctagctgaaagcttg-3′). This tagged cDNA was subcloned downstream of a splice acceptor sequence derived from exon 2 of
the mouse albumin gene, creating pTG1-K5-mSp2HA. The
integrity of this transgene construct was confirmed by
automated DNA sequencing. The transgene was linearized,
and pronuclear injections (FVB/NJ) and implantations were
performed by staff of the University of North Carolina
Animal Models Core Facility. Transgene-carrying animals
were identified via the PCR using transgene-specific primers
(5′-gctgcaaggcaagtttatccctagctgagc-3′ and 5′-agggagatggctgggagtcc-3′), and two male founders (designated A and C)
were identified via crosses with FVB/NJ females and genotyping of progeny. All animal experiments were conducted
with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of North Carolina State University.

Cloning of transgene integration sites and
mouse genotyping
Transgene integration sites were isolated using a procedure described previously (16), subjected to automated
DNA sequencing, and compared with the mouse genome
sequence. Allele-specific primers were developed that facilitate the identification of wild-type (WT), hemizygous, and
homozygous animals among progeny within each transgenic
strain (termed Sp2-A and Sp2-C). For Sp2-A progeny, the primers are 5′-cgtgtgcaccaggcatttgatc-3′, 5′-gggtgactgaggcagagtttg-3′, and 5′-caagcagttctgagacctgcac-3′. For Sp2-C
progeny, the primers are 5′-acattgcagcacattgcacactatcc-3′,
5′-gttctaagcactaacatcatcaggcg-3′, and 5′-gttagctgataaccttttgaagaccg-3′. Animals carrying the K15-EGFP transgene were
identified with gene-specific primers (5′-aagttcatctgcaccaccg-3′ and 5′-tccttgaagaagatggtgcg-3′).
RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNAs were prepared from neonatal and adult animals using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corp.), first-strand
cDNAs were synthesized using oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) primers
and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and
gene-specific primers (5′-ccagcctaccccaaggaaac-3′ and 5′gggagccctgaatctgaagtat-3′) were used to amplify Sp2 message. Sp2 expression was quantitated using an iQ5 iCycler
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) and QuantiTect SYBR Green
(Qiagen, Inc.). The Ct value for Sp2 expression in each sample
was normalized by subtracting the Ct value for amplification
of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 5′gggtgtgaaccacgagaaat-3′ and 5′-ccttccacaatgccaaagtt-3′).
Transfection and Western blotting
COS-1 cells were transfected with expression constructs
using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). The construction and
properties of an epitope-tagged human Sp2 expression construct (pCMV4-hSp2/flu) have been described (8, 11, 12, 17).
Western blots were performed as described (8) using anti-HA
and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-Sp2
(Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) antibodies, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent
kit (ECL; GE Healthcare Amersham).
Preparation of tissue sections and
immunohistochemical staining
Whole neonates or dorsal skin samples were fixed in 10%
formalin and embedded in paraffin, and 10-μm sections
were placed on glass slides. Sections were deparaffinized
and rehydrated by consecutive incubations in xylene, 100%
ethanol, and 95% ethanol and subjected to staining with
H&E or immunohistochemistry as described (18–20). Antibodies against keratins 5, 6, 10, 14, and 15 and loricrin were
obtained from Covance Research Products, Inc. A monoclonal anti–keratin 8 antibody has been described (21).
CD34 and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences, Inc. Antibodies against EGFP
and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; clone PC10)
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Dako,
Inc., respectively.

Sp2 Inhibits Differentiation, Stimulates Tumorigenesis

Wounding assay
Mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation, dorsal
surfaces were sterilized, and full-thickness wounds (4 mm
in diameter) were introduced using a dermal biopsy punch
(Miltex, Inc.). Wounded animals were checked daily for healing and papilloma development.
Treatment of animals with DMBA/TPA
Dorsal surfaces of WT and transgenic littermates were
shaved, and animals were replaced into their cages for
48 hours. Shaved surfaces were treated topically with a single
dose (200 nmol) of DMBA in acetone. Two weeks later,
DMBA-treated animals were treated topically twice per week
with TPA (6.8 nmol in acetone) for 20 weeks. Animals were
checked daily for papilloma development.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of results was determined using
the Student's t test. Differences with P values of <0.05 are
considered significant.

Results and Discussion
Sp2 protein expression increases in concert with
DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis
Because Sp2 expression is correlated directly with the
progression of human prostate cancers (15), it became of
interest to determine if this correlation might extend to
additional neoplasms at one or more stages of tumor progression. We chose carcinogen-induced mouse squamous
cell carcinomas as our model system for these studies. Protein extracts were prepared from normal whole skin and epidermis; a series of small-, medium-, and large-sized DMBA/
TPA-induced papillomas; a mouse cell line derived from a
DMBA/TPA-induced squamous cell carcinoma (MT2.6; ref.
18); and a spontaneously immortalized mouse keratinocyte
cell line (BALB/MK2; ref. 22), and equivalent amounts of
each extract were examined by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 1A, Sp2 expression was below the limit of detection in
normal mouse skin (lane 1), epidermis (lane 2), or small-sized
papillomas (lanes 3–5). Sp2 expression was barely detectable in medium-sized papillomas (lanes 6–8), was expressed
to significant levels in two of three large-sized papillomas
(lanes 9–11), and was expressed strongly in BALB/MK2 and
MT2.6 cells (lanes 12 and 13, respectively). These results indicate that Sp2 expression is upregulated in this model system, is correlated directly with the progression of DMBA/
TPA-induced neoplasms, and is a feature of immortalized
(BALB/MK2) keratinocytes. In contrast, Sp1 expression
was not correlated with progression in this model system
(Fig. 1A). Sp2 expression is also elevated in human squamous
carcinoma cell lines relative to primary human keratinocytes
(Fig. 1B).
Generation of transgenic mice in which Sp2 is
expressed ectopically in basal keratinocytes
To determine if Sp2 expression drives tumor progression
or is only associated with it, we generated a transgene

www.aacrjournals.org

(pTG1-K5-mSp2HA) in which expression of an epitopetagged (Influenza HA) mouse Sp2 cDNA (13) is regulated by
the bovine keratin 5 promoter. This promoter has been used
extensively to express genes of interest in basal keratinocytes,
the cell of origin for DMBA/TPA-induced tumors (23–27).
To confirm the integrity of this construct, COS-1 cells were
transiently transfected with pTG1-K5-mSp2HA or an expression plasmid (pCMV4-hSp2/flu) carrying an epitope-tagged
human Sp2 cDNA that has been characterized (8, 11,
12, 17). As shown in Fig. 1C, proteins of the expected size
(80 kDa) were detected with an anti-HA antibody in extracts
prepared from transfected cells (lanes 2 and 3) but not in an
extract prepared from control cells (lane 1).
The transgene carried by pTG1-K5-mSp2HA was injected
into FVB/NJ pronuclei, and two male founders (denoted A
and C) were identified. One half of the progeny derived from
each founder inherited the transgene, indicating that integration occurred within a single chromosome. We used a PCRbased strategy (16) to clone transgene integration sites and
developed PCR-based assays that identify hemizygous and
homozygous descendents (Fig. 1D; data not shown). The integration sites for founders A and C were mapped to mouse
chromosomes 6 and 5, respectively. The Sp2-A integration
site occurred in an intergenic region 40 kbp upstream of
mouse Olr1 (oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1),
whereas the Sp2-C integration site occurred within intron
15 of the latrophilin 3 (Lphn3/CIRL3) locus. Lphn3/CIRL3
encodes a brain-specific G protein–coupled receptor that
is expressed most abundantly immediately after birth (28).
It is not known if Lphn3/CIRL3 is an essential gene, nor is
its physiologic significance understood.
Sp2 overexpression in basal keratinocytes causes
alopecia in hemizygotes and postnatal lethality
in homozygotes
Sp2-A and Sp2-C hemizygotes have been bred with FVB/NJ
animals for more than 11 generations and exhibit normal life
expectancy and fecundity. Most Sp2-A hemizygotes develop
alopecia and hyperkeratosis beginning at 2 months of age
(Fig. 2A). These skin abnormalities can occur at discrete sites
(e.g., sites of abrasion or repetitive movement) or extend
throughout the dorsal surface, and affected regions increase
in severity with age. Sp2-C hemizygotes do not exhibit alopecia or other gross phenotypic abnormalities. Homozygous
Sp2-A or Sp2-C transgenic pups are produced at expected
ratios, and the gross appearance of these animals at birth
is indistinguishable from WT and hemizygous littermates.
However, homozygotes perish within the first 2 weeks of postnatal life. The skin of Sp2-A homozygotes begins to deteriorate
on postnatal day 3 (PD3), becoming increasingly reddened and
hyperkeratotic (Fig. 2B, asterisks). Such pups become runted
and developmentally retarded relative to their littermates
and succumb before PD13. The skin of Sp2-C homozygotes
deteriorates more quickly, and pups perish before PD3.
Histologic examinations of PD1 Sp2-A homozygous pups
revealed a well-structured stratified epidermis with an intact
stratum corneum, as well as developing sebaceous glands
and hair follicles similar to WT animals. Multifocal apoptosis

within the epidermal basal layer was marginally elevated
relative to WT littermates with scattered disorganization of
basal cells that became significantly more pronounced by
PD4. A loss of normal epidermal architecture was noted by
PD6 with a disorganization of cells in all layers and occasional areas of partial to complete epidermal collapse where the
stratum spinosum contacted the dermis. Loss of laminar epidermal architecture was accompanied by scattered apoptosis, hypertrophy, and hydropic swelling of keratinocytes, as
well as orthokeratotic laminated hyperkeratosis and patchy
areas of parakeratosis. The severity and extent of these aforementioned features worsened progressively through PD13.
Histologic examinations of Sp2-C pups revealed identical epidermal defects.
To assess levels of Sp2 expression in transgenic animals,
two experiments were performed. First, RNAs were harvested
from whole skin of WT, hemizygous, and homozygous postnatal pups and Sp2 expression was detected via RT-PCR. As
shown in Fig. 2C, robust levels of Sp2 message were detected
in hemizygous and homozygous Sp2-A (left) and Sp2-C (right)
animals relative to WT littermates. Second, levels of Sp2

expression were quantified by real-time PCR as a function of
animal age. Real-time PCR assays performed with RNAs from
whole skin of 3-month-old hemizygotes indicated that Sp2
expression was ∼20-fold above endogenous levels in Sp2-A
animals and elevated by 200-fold in Sp2-C animals (data not
shown). Levels of exogenous Sp2 expression in Sp2-C hemizygotes increased with age, whereas transgene expression levels
in Sp2-A hemizygotes remained unchanged (data not shown).
To determine if proteins of expected sizes were synthesized
in transgenic animals, denatured extracts were prepared from
whole skin and Western blots were performed using an antiHA antibody. Consistent with results obtained in transfection
experiments (Fig. 1C), a single protein of 80 kDa was detected
(data not shown). To determine if the bovine keratin 5 promoter directed expression of Sp2 to basal keratinocytes,
paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from whole skin
harvested from WT and homozygous Sp2-A littermates and
exogenous Sp2 expression was detected via immunohistochemistry using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D,

the hair follicle outer root sheath stained strongly with an

anti-HA antibody, whereas sections prepared from WT
animals lacked staining. We conclude that the Sp2 transgene
is expressed as anticipated, and Sp2 overexpression in basal
keratinocytes results in alopecia in Sp2-A hemizygotes and
postnatal lethality in Sp2-A and Sp2-C homozygotes.
Sp2 overexpression causes arrested differentiation
of the interfollicular epidermis
To determine the consequence of Sp2 overexpression for
epidermal differentiation, paraffin-embedded whole skin sec-

tions were prepared from Sp2-A homozygotes and WT littermates on successive postnatal days. Pups were injected with
BrdUrd 1 hour before euthanasia to label proliferating cells,
and skin sections were examined with anti-BrdUrd antibodies as well as antibodies against differentiation-specific
markers. As shown in Fig. 3A, sections stained with H&E
revealed that the epidermis of WT and homozygotes is similar in cell stratification and thickness on PD2 but diverges
markedly on subsequent postnatal days. The epidermis of
homozygotes thickened increasingly on PD3 to PD4 relative

to WT littermates, with hypertrophic and hydropically
swollen cells accumulating in disorganized epidermal
layers. To determine whether markers of basal (keratins 5
and 14) and suprabasal (keratin 10) keratinocytes were
expressed on these postnatal days, paraffin-embedded sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Keratins 5,
10, and 14 were expressed as expected in WT animals
(Fig. 3A, top), whereas the expression of these markers was
altered profoundly in homozygotes (Fig. 3A, bottom). Basal
keratinocytes of homozygotes expressed keratin 5 on PD2
with sporadic keratin 5–stained cells noted in suprabasal
layers. The abundance of keratin 5–positive cells in all epidermal cell layers increased significantly on PD3 to PD4.
Similarly, keratin 14 expression was detected in basal keratinocytes on PD2 and in all epidermal layers on subsequent
days. Keratin 10 expression was detected in all suprabasal

layers on PD2, and diminished to low levels or was absent
in the granular and cornified layers during subsequent postnatal days.
To extend this analysis, paraffin-embedded sections on
PD4 were examined for the expression of a bevy of additional
markers (Fig. 3B). The expression of keratin 6, a marker
associated with neoplastic, inflamed, and/or wounded epidermis, was detected in the epidermis of homozygotes but
not WT animals (29, 30). Keratin 8, an alternative heterodimeric partner of keratin 14 and a keratin normally restricted
to “simple” epithelia, was detected in the epidermis of homozygotes and absent in WT animals (31–34). Finally, a marker
characteristic of the stratum corneum, loricrin, was not
detected in homozygotes.

the interfollicular epidermis, two experiments were performed. First, PD4 sections were stained for the expression
of CD34, a well-characterized marker of this stem cell population (35, 36). Second, a lineage tracing experiment was performed in which Sp2-A mice were intercrossed with animals
that express a transgene, K15-EGFP, restricted to bulgederived stem cells (37, 38). CD34- and EGFP-positive cells
were detected within the basal and suprabasal layers of
Sp2-A homozygotes, but not WT littermates, on PD4, indicating the recruitment of bulge-derived cells to the interfollicular epidermis (Fig. 3B).
Finally, sections were stained with an anti-BrdUrd antibody to identify proliferating cells. BrdUrd-positive cells were
detected in the basal layers of both WT and homozygous
animals; however, BrdUrd-positive cells were also noted in
suprabasal layers of homozygotes (Fig. 3B, arrowhead). To
quantify basal cell proliferation, BrdUrd-positive cells within

the interfollicular epidermis of WT and homozygous postnatal animals were enumerated and compared. As shown
in Fig. 3C, BrdUrd-positive basal cells were more numerous
in homozygotes; however, this level of increased cell proliferation was not statistically significant (P < 0.1). Taken together,
we conclude from these immunohistochemical analyses that
Sp2 overexpression in basal keratinocytes produces a population of phenotypically immature keratinocytes that seem
unable to commit to the epidermal differentiation program.
Sp2 overexpression renders hemizygous animals
susceptible to wound-induced neoplasia
In the course of these studies, we noted that Sp2-C hemizygotes developed occasional papillomas at sites of ear
punches or minor wounds sustained from littermates. To
quantify this apparent susceptibility to wound-induced neoplasia, full-thickness surgical wounds (4 mm in diameter)

were introduced into the dorsal skin of Sp2-C hemizygotes
and WT littermates and these animals were monitored for
the development of papillomas. As shown in Fig. 4A, surgery-induced papillomas developed within weeks following
wounding of Sp2-C hemizygotes. Whereas surgical wounding
of WT animals did not induce the formation of a single papilloma, 27% of wounds sustained by Sp2-C hemizygotes
induced papillomagenesis (P = 0.001; Fig. 5A). To determine
if the incidence of wound-induced papillomagenesis is influenced by animal age, results presented in Fig. 5A were plotted as a function of the age of Sp2-C animals at the time of
surgery. Whereas young animals (1–4 months of age) were
only mildly susceptible to wound-induced papillomas, 70%

of animals developed papillomas when wounded at 6 to 10
months of age, and this increased incidence of papillomagenesis is statistically significant (P < 0.01; Fig. 5B). We conclude
from these results that Sp2 overexpression in basal keratinocytes induces a marked susceptibility to wound-induced
neoplasms. Moreover, this susceptibility to papillomagenesis
increases in concert with the age-dependent increase in Sp2
expression noted in these animals.
Histologic examinations of wound-induced lesions revealed them to be pedunculated to sessile cutaneous papillomas, composed of epidermal hyperplasia and fibrovascular
stroma that often contained mixed neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (Fig. 4B). Multifocal areas of mild

Sp2 Inhibits Differentiation, Stimulates Tumorigenesis

epidermal dysplasia were accompanied by mild to moderate
keratinocyte apoptosis in the basal and immediate suprabasal
layers, where lymphocyte satellitosis was occasionally noted.
Skin sections prepared from wound-induced papillomas were
examined by immunohistochemistry for markers of cell proliferation (PCNA) and keratinocyte differentiation (keratins 5,
6, 8, 10, 14, and 15 and loricrin). Consistent with expectations,
only a minority of basal cells within the epidermis at the margins of wound-induced papillomas stained with PCNA antibodies (Fig. 4C, left column). In stark contrast, PCNA-positive
cells were detected throughout wound-induced papillomas
in basal as well as suprabasal cell layers (Fig. 4C, right
column). Differentiation markers (keratins 5, 14, and 15)
expressed within cells of the basal cell layer in margin tissue
were detected largely in suprabasal layers of wound-induced
papillomas (Fig. 4C). Keratin 10 was detected in all suprabasal layers in margin tissue, yet was detected weakly in the
most superficial suprabasal layers of papillomas (Fig. 4C).
Consistent with results noted earlier for postnatal transgenic
homozygotes, keratins 6 and 8 were detected throughout
the epidermis of wound-induced neoplasms (Fig. 4C).
Finally, diffuse loricrin expression was detected in papillomas within an expanded suprabasal zone relative to its restricted expression within the cornified layer of margin
tissue (Fig. 4C). We conclude from immunohistochemical
results that wound-induced neoplasms are composed of
highly proliferative, phenotypically immature keratinocytes
that exhibit a profound disruption of the epidermal differentiation program.
Sp2 overexpression increases the sensitivity of
hemizygous animals to skin carcinogenesis
To determine if Sp2 overexpression increases the sensitivity of basal keratinocytes to transformation by an environmental carcinogen, papillomagenesis in Sp2-C hemizygotes
and control animals was analyzed using a “two-stage” model
of skin carcinogenesis. WT and hemizygous Sp2-C littermates were treated with a single application of DMBA followed by twice weekly treatments with TPA for 20 weeks.
Sp2-C hemizygotes and WT littermates developed papillomas 5.5 and 7.5 weeks following DMBA treatment, respectively (data not shown), and DMBA/TPA-treated Sp2-C
hemizygotes exhibited greater numbers of papillomas per animal throughout the course of this study (Fig. 5C). Treated
animals were sacrificed before the progression of papillomas
to squamous cell carcinomas, and thus, it was not possible to
determine whether ectopic Sp2 expression affects the incidence of tumor progression. We conclude from these results

that Sp2 overexpression in basal keratinocytes increases their
sensitivity to an environmental carcinogen.
This study establishes that Sp2 overexpression inhibits the
differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, rendering these
cells susceptible to oncogenesis. Indeed, the striking incidence of wound-induced papillomagenesis in Sp2-C hemizygotes indicates that Sp2 overexpression is sufficient, in the
appropriate physiologic milieu, to subvert mechanisms controlling basal cell proliferation and differentiation. Similar
susceptibilities to wound-induced neoplasia have been reported in transgenic animals expressing potent oncogenes
(e.g., Ha-ras or v-jun) in this same epidermal compartment
(39–41). It will be of interest to determine whether woundinduced neoplasms in Sp2-C hemizygotes are dependent on
inflammatory growth factors and cytokines released following wounding, as has been noted in other systems (42–45).
Because stem cells supporting the interfollicular epidermis
are located within the basal layer, our results suggest that
Sp2 may regulate the commitment of progenitors in this,
and perhaps additional, stem cell compartments. In keeping
with this speculation, Sp2 overexpression is associated with
the progression of human prostatic carcinoma and thus Sp2
may regulate the proliferation/differentiation of progenitor
cells in tissues beyond the epidermis (14). To our knowledge,
this study provides the first direct evidence that Sp family
members can function as oncogenes, and suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting Sp2 may prove efficacious.
