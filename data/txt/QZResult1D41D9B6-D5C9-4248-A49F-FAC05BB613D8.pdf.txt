ABSTRACT
Multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) have been at the forefront of cancer
research, designed to mimic tumor-like developmental patterns in vitro. Tumor growth
in vivo is highly influenced by aberrant cell surface-specific sialoglycan structures on
glycoproteins. Aberrant sialoglycan patterns that facilitate MTS formation are not well
defined. Matrix-free spheroids from breast MCF-7 and pancreatic PANC1 cancer cell
lines and their respective tamoxifen (TMX) and gemcitabine (Gem) resistant variants
were generated using the RGD platform of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide
modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK (TPP)).
MCF-7 and MCF-7 TMX cells formed tight spheroids both in the classical agaroseand RGD-based platforms while all PANC1 cells formed loose aggregates. Using
lectin histochemistry staining, sialidase assay, neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) and
oseltamivir phosphate (OP) neuraminidase inhibitor treatments, MCF-7 and PANC1
cells and their drug-resistant variants expressed different sialic acid (SA) content on
their cell surfaces. a-2,3- and a-2,6-sialic acid surface residues facilitated spheroid
formation under cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced self-assembly. Pretreatment with a-2,3SA specific Maackia amurensis (MAL-II) lectin, a-2,6-SA specific Sambucus nigra
(SNA) lectin, and exogenous a-2,6-SA specific neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae) dosedependently reduced spheroid volume. OP enhanced cell aggregation and compaction
forming spheroids. PANC1 and MDA-MB231 xenograft tumors from untreated and
OP-treated RAGxCg double mutant mice expressed significantly higher levels of a-2,3SA over a-2,6-SA. MCF-7 spheroids also expressed a high a-2,3-SA to a-2,6-SA ratio.
These results suggest that the relative levels of specific sialoglycan structures on the
cell surface correlate with the ability of cancer cells to form avascular multicellular
tumor spheroids and in vivo xenograft tumors.

multidrug resistance and various cell processes, including
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis

drug screening [7, 8]. Since spheroids resemble the 3D
architecture of avascular tumors, including multicellular

arrangement and extracellular matrix deposition typically
found in vivo, spheroid cells also demonstrate enhanced
resistance to chemotherapy [9]. Tumor spheroids in
matrigel or in ECM-based matrixes are good study models
to investigate cell motility and anti-metastatic compounds
in vitro [6, 10]. However, novel MTS formations,
particularly under matrix-free conditions, are being
developed to study the 3D architecture of avascular tumor
models [1, 9, 11–13], especially in relation to metastasis,
invasion and therapeutic drug screening [13, 14].
Presently, the molecular development of MTS formation
by cancer cells may involve (a) cell surface proteins
binding fibronectin which induces 3D cohesion [15], (b)
under conditions of random positioning machine (RPM)
simulating microgravity, the expression of 28 genes aside
from β -tubulin is mutually controlled by a key cytokine
interleukin-8 (IL-8 or CXCL8) gene within the framework
of 6 extracellular, 6 membrane, 15 cytoplasmic and 2
nuclear proteins [16], and/or (c) the integrins’ interactions
with the extracellular matrices (ECM) and intracellular
components within the cellular cytoskeleton in particular
response to mechanical stimulation [16, 17].
It has been reported that MTS formation involves
a number of highly glycosylated integrins such as αvβ3
and α5β1 on the cell surface [18, 19]. It is well known
that integrin expression correlates with metastases in a
large variety of cancers [20]. Since integrins are highly
glycosylated receptors, recent reports have reviewed
altered expression of sialylated glycoproteins with
elevated levels of cell-surface α2,6-sialic acids (SA)
that are linked to colorectal cancer metastasis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance [21, 22]. In addition, the
altered mammalian sialidase(s) expression was reported
not to result from metastatic potential, but rather from a
determining event affecting metastatic ability [23]. It was
proposed by the report that SA expression on tumor cell
surfaces appears to vary from cell to cell. Other reports
have shown that altered sialylation of glycoproteins
is closely associated with metastatic potential and cell
invasiveness [24–29]. With regard to integrins, Pocheć
et al. [30] proposed that the β1-6-branched sialic acid of
αvβ3 integrins promotes the metastatic characteristics and
migration of melanoma cells.
Recently, we have shown that a synthetic cyclic
RGD-peptide induces formation of 3D MTS in a simple,
single-step, reproducible procedure. The resulting
MTS can be developed and employed as 3D models for
assessing antitumor drug efficacy [31] and was studied
in twelve cancer cell lines. The report describes the selfassembly of cancer cells from monolayer cultures into
MTS, a process that was directly induced by the RGDpeptide. The self-assembly formation of monolayer
cultures into MTS was induced by the cyclic Arg-GlyAsp-D-Phe-Lys (cyclo-RGDfK) peptide, modified
with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide
cation (TPP). The resulting modified peptide, cyclowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RGDfK(TPP) was used in the concentration range of
10-100 uM. The 3D characterization of the spheroids
showed unimodal structures, ranging from 60-120 μm
in diameter, and varying between cell lines and medium
serum concentration [31]. The report also proposes that
these cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptides mimick the natural
ECM protein’s ability to induce cell aggregation via α5β1
integrin.
To evaluate the role of sialylation of cancer cell
surfaces in spheroid formation, we used the cycloRGDfK(TPP) approach to biochemically induce cell
aggregation and compaction, transmogrifying monolayer
cancer cells into tumor spheroids.

RESULTS
Spheroid formation
The ability of cancer cells and their chemoresistant
variants to form spheroids was studied using the RGDpeptide-based platform which causes specific biochemical
alterations of cell surface receptors. These alterations
induced self-assembly in monolayer cell cultures into 3D
MTS by facilitating cell-cell recognitions, interactions and
adhesion [31]. The hypothesis is that the RGD-peptide
platform potentiates a higher tendency for cell clustering
and compaction. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether
the RGD-peptide approach is a universal platform to form
tumor spheroids. Here, human breast adenocarcinoma
MCF-7 cells formed tight compact spheroids using both
the classical and RGD-based platforms (Figures 1A and
1C), while pancreatic carcinoma PANC1 cells formed
only loose aggregates even after 7 days of incubation
(Figure 1B and 1D). PANC1 cells forming aggregatelike spheroids are consistent with another report
using PANC1 cells on tissue culture dishes containing
conditioned serum-free medium [32]. We have reported
similar aggregate-like irregular spheroids using cycloRGDfK(TPP) for malignant melanoma A-375 cells [31].
The ability of MCF-7 and PANC1 cells to form
spheroids is proposed here to be dependent on the property
of the cell lines, and not on the platform used. Using the
cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide approach to form spheroids,
tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 TMX (Figure 1B) and
gemcitabine-resistant PANC1-GemR (Figure 1D) cells
readily formed spheroids compared with their parental
cell lines. The MCF-7 TMX cells formed complete
spheroids after 7 days of incubation with 25 μM cycloRGDfK(TPP), while parental MCF-7 cells did not form
clear-cut spheroids under these conditions (Figure 1C). To
generate spheroids from MCF-7 cells, a minimum of 50
μM cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) was needed. For PANC1-GemR
cells, the formation of irregular spheroid-like aggregates
was observed after 3-4 days of incubation with 12.5 μM
of cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) (Figure 1D), while 25 μM peptide
was required for parental PANC1. In contrast, cells on

agarose-coated plates did not show any differences in
spheroid cell formation between MCF-7 and MCF-7 TMX
cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Collectively, the results
suggest that the chemoresistant cancer cells may have
characteristic properties that make them more liable to cell
aggregation and compaction using the cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)
platform compared with the parental cell lines.
Using the cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide platform,
we determined the optimal ability of cell aggregation
and compaction, leading to the formation of spheroids.
Here, the growth of MCF-7, MCF-7-TMX, PANC1 and
PANC1-GemR spheroid cells was facilitated by cycloRGDfK(TPP) peptide at different concentrations, and
performed the cell proliferation assay using the WST-1
reagent [33]. The reagent was added simultaneously to the
removed supernatant with floating spheroids and to the
residual monolayer cells adherent to the well plate after
4 days of cell growth. Live cell numbers are proportional
to absorbance at 420 nm. For MCF-7 TMX cells, more
floating spheroid cells and less adherent cells were found
compared to MCF-7 cells in the range of 12.5-50 μM

cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) (Figure 2). There were no differences
found up to 6.25 μM of cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide (no
spheroid formation) and for 100 μM of peptide (spheroid
cells). Collectively, cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide clearly
promoted spheroid formation dose-dependently for both
parental and chemoresistant cells. The effects of the
peptide in promoting spheroid formation are more robust
for the MCF-7 TMX cells than the MCF-7 cells over
most of the range of peptide concentrations. The effect of
cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide on PANC1-GemR spheroid
formation is better in the mid-range of 25 μM of cycloRGDfK(TPP) peptide concentration, but the differences
are not significant at low and high concentrations of
peptide.

the spheroid cells [32], we examined prior to spheroid
formation the cell surface sialylation of monolayer MCF7, MCF-7 TMX cells (Figure 3), and PANC1 and PANC1GemR cells (Figure 4). This analysis was conducted using
lectin histochemistry staining and flow cytometry with
α-2,3-sialic acid (SA) specific Maackia amurensis (MALII) and α-2,6-SA specific Sambucus nigra (SNA). The data
indicate that the chemoresistant MCF-7 TMX cells (Figure
3G) have more α-2,3-SA cell surface expression than
α-2,6-SA compared to the parental cell lines as determined
by flow cytometry analyses. The significance of these
findings suggest that chemoresistant MCF-7 TMX and
PANC1-GemR may have particular sialylated N-linked
glycans that contribute to the metastatic phenotype and

potential of tumor cells, as proposed by Dennis and
Laferte [25], Park and Lee [21] and Haxho et al. [22]. In
support of our data, Cui et al. [34] examined the α2,3SA expression levels in primary and pair-matched lymph
node metastatic human tumors as well in triple negative
MDA-MB-231, invasive ductal breast carcinoma T-47D
and MCF-7 cell lines. Their data showed that the primary
lymph node metastatic tumors had significantly elevated
levels of α2,3-SA compared to that of primary ones. In
addition, the highly metastatic MBA-MB-231 breast
cancer cell line also expressed the highest α2,3-SA content
compared to other cell lines. These findings were shown to
be linked to the α2,3 sialyltransferase mRNA levels.

of MCF-7 cells were treated with M. amurensis lectin
MAL II (α2,3-SA), Sambucus nigra lectin SNA (α2,6SA), peanut agglutinin (PNA, galactosyl (β-1,3)
N-acetylgalactosamine), or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA,
N-acetylglucosamine residues) in a dose-dependent
manner together each with 50 μM cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)
for 4 days of incubation. Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells
with MAL II and SNA lectins dose-dependently and
significantly reduced spheroid formation in the presence
of 50 μM cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) (Figure 6A and 6B). In
contrast, PNA and WGA had no inhibitory effects on
cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced MCF-7 spheroid formation
(Figure 6C and 6D). It is noteworthy that WGA was
shown to have an IC50 of 5.4 μg/mL for monolayer MCF7 cells based on the cell viability assay (data not shown),
which is consistent with another report [36].
We have recently shown activation of epidermal
growth factor receptors (EGFR) is regulated by a cellsurface signaling complex involving neuraminidase-1
(Neu1), matrix metaloproteinase-9 (MMP9), and the
neuromedin B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) [37].
The report also provided evidence to indicate that Neu1

Other reports have shown that the catalytic cleavage
of SA of E-cadherin on the cell surface of MCF-7 cells
by neuraminidase (from Vibrio cholerae, cleavage rate of
α2,6-SA > α2,3-SA > α2,8-SA) prevented cell adhesion
or aggregation [35]. We hypothesized that the cell surface
expression of α2,6-SA facilitates spheroid formation. Here,
pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with a neuraminidase (from
Vibrio cholerae) was performed followed with MALII and SNA lectin histochemistry staining. Treatment
of MCF-7 cells with 25U of neuraminidase for 24 hrs
showed a pronounced removal of α2,6-SA compared with
no effects on α2,3-SA (Figure 5A). The data in Figure
5B clearly support the hypothesis. MCF-7 cells treated
with 0.25U or 25U neuraminidase in the presence of 50
μM cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) significantly reduced spheroid
volume compared with the untreated control. To measure
spheroid volume, we defined a spheroid as a compact
rounded aggregation of cells with a distinct border of
diameter ≥60 μm containing cells indistinguishable from
one another, according to Akasov et al. [31].
To test the role of SA on spheroid formation, we
performed a lectin inhibition assay where monolayers

specifically cleaves α-2,3-SA on EGF receptors to remove
steric hindrance of the receptor, with subsequent receptor
association, activation and downstream signaling. Neu1
complexed with MMP-9 and GPCR tethered to receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and TOLL-like receptors (TLRs)
has been reported by us as a major target in multistage
tumorigenesis [22]. Furthermore, Neu4 sialidase has been
reported to be a regulator of neurospheres derived from
patient samples and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
cell line [38]. The report provided strong evidence to
demonstrate that Neu4 overexpression is associated
with an upregulation of stem cell-like properties in
neuroblastoma cells. Remarkably, Neu4 expression levels
were significantly decreased in differentiated and nonneurosphere GBM cells.
If activated Neu1 and Neu4 in complex with
glycosylated receptors act as promoters of spheroid
formation, it is important to assess the sialidase activity
of live cells in both monolayer cultures, as well as MTS.
In this report, we conducted a live cell sialidase assay
[39–41] to determine whether the selected cancer cell
lines express sialidase activity on their surface. Naïve live

MCF-7 and PANC1 cells exhibited significantly more
sialidase activity than the chemoresistant variants, MCF-7
TMX and PANC1-GemR (Figure 7A). Mean fluorescence
surrounding viable cells is depicted in the bar graph
(Figure 7B). Collectively, sialidase activity reduction on
the surface of chemoresistant MCF-7 TMX and PANC1GemR cells identifies them as non-sphere-differentiated
chemoresistant cells, similar to previous reports for nonneurosphere-differentiated GBM cells [38].
We have also reported that oseltamivir phosphate (OP)
inhibits Neu1 [41] and Neu4 [42] sialidase activity with IC50
values of 1.175μM for LPS-stimulated BMC2 macrophage
cells and 0.019μM for thymoquinone (TQ)-stimulated
BMC2 cells, respectively. TQ specifically activates Neu4
sialidase [38, 42, 43]. Here, we used MCF-7, PANC1
and PANC1-GemR cells to determine if OP-inhibition
of sialidase activity is involved in cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)facilitated spheroid formation. MCF-7 cells treated with OP
(400 μg/mL) and cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) (50μM) produced
early visible spheroids after 1-3 days and an increase in
spheroid volume by day 5 (Figure 7B and 7C). There was
a decrease in spheroid volume by day 7 in the presence of

using a x20 objective. Quantitative analysis was done by assessing the density of cell staining corrected for background in each panel using

OP. For OP ≥ 400 μg/mL, the cell viability of monolayer
PANC1 cells [44], MCF-7 and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7
TMX cells [45] was significantly reduced after 3 days. For
PANC1 and PANC1-GemR cells, 200 μg/mL OP and 50μM
cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) for 5 days produced cell aggregates
and compaction that were darker than those without OP,
indicating improved cell compaction and tighter cell-cell
contacts (Figure 6B). The effect of OP on spheroid formation
might be explained by (a) OP increases the expression of
E-cadherin [44], an important role in spheroid compaction of
breast carcinoma [46], hepatoma [47] and hepatocytes [48,
49] and/or (b) inhibition of Neu4 sialidase [38].

phosphate (OP) for PANC1 tumors or 30 mg/kg OP for
MDA-MB231 tumors, and were analyzed in comparison
to their respective, untreated cohorts. Since OP affects
α2,3-SA expression in PANC1 and MCF-7 cells, paraffinembedded necropsy tumor sections were investigated for
differences in α2,6-SA and α2,3-SA expression levels.
Using fluorescence histochemical staining, tumors from OPtreated cohort showed strong staining for α2,3-SA compared
with the untreated cohort (Figure 8). Sections with no
primary antibody added (background fluorescence control)
demonstrated minimal non-specific staining. Our findings
also show that avascular MCF-7 tumor spheroids express
higher α2,3-SA over α2,6-SA (Figure 9). Collectively, these
data implicate a novel role for cell-surface sialylation, in
relation to both sialic acid content and linkage specificity, in
the formation of multicellular tumor spheroids.

different SA content, which influenced their ability to
form spheroids under cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced
self-assembly. Cancer cell aggregation and compaction
correlates with the presence of α-2.3- and α-2,6-sialic
acid cell surface residues to form spheroids under
cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)-induced self-assembly. Removal
or blockage of SA inhibited cell aggregation for MCF7 and MCF-7 TMX cells under cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)
peptide. Neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate
enhanced cell aggregation and promoted compaction of
cell aggregates.
Using the classical agarose-coated plates to form
spheroids in a time-dependent manner, spheroid-forming
MCF-7 vs MCF-7 TMX cells and PANC1 vs PANCGemR cells did not show any differences in spheroid
cell formation (Supplemental Figure 1). In the classical
platform of spheroid formation, including agarose-coated
wells, hanging drop, and rotary culture, the resulting
cell aggregation and compaction occur due to acting
mechanical forces and/or surface properties which may
prevent cell attachment to the cellular matrix in the
culture well plate. To form spheroids, all of the cells are
required to be in a 3D configuration. Raghavan et al.
[1] have recently compared different methodologies to
generate tumor spheroids in terms of morphology, cellular
arrangement, and chemosensitivity. These methods
include hanging drop array plates, liquid overlay on ultralow attachment plates, and liquid overlay on ultra-low
attachment plates with rotating mixing (nutator plates).
They found that the different methods of tumor spheroid
generation resulted in varied cellular arrangement and
chemosensitivity. For most currently available 3D
classical methods for spheroid formation, these techniques
are time consuming, lack reproducibility and mainly
rely on microscopic observations, thus there is a need
to standardize and develop rapid protocols for tumor
spheroid formations [50].
Terao et al. [32] demonstrated that the gemcitabineresistant pancreatic cancer cells (PANC1-RG) contained a
greater population of cells with stem cell-like properties,
when compared to the parental PANC1 cells. Specifically,
the stem cell-like phenotype was characterized by higher
levels of both CD24 and CD44 in the PANC1-RG cells.
The same group also found that PANC1-RG cells could
form spheroids more effectively, and larger in size, than
their PANC1 counterparts. It is noteworthy that a few
studies using spheroid formation on chemoresistant cancer
cells have been performed [14, 50]. It is interesting to note
from the report by Terao et al. [32] that sphere-forming
cells and PANC1 stem-like cells expressed high levels
of fucosylated glycans. Using AAL and AOL lectins in
western blot analysis, it was found that spheroid-forming
cells demonstrated increased binding to both lectins, when
compared to the monolayer cells [32]. These findings
may be partially explained by the branched N-glycans,
including fucosylation sites, covalently conjugated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to cell adhesion molecules. These glycans, linked to
both cadherins and integrins, are known to play key
structural and functional roles in cell-cell recognition and
interaction [51].
Consistent with this premise, several other reports
have shown that breast carcinoma cell lines [46], hepatoma
[47] and hepatocytes [48, 49] are able to form spheroids
dependent on E-cadherin. Iglesias et al. [46] analyzed
the capability of 11 breast cancer cell lines to form
mammospheres, and thus able to continually proliferate
in a non-adherent state. Only MCF7, T47D, BT474,
MDA-MB-436 and JIMT1 cells could be passaged and
developed into mammospheres, while other cancer cells
including SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-435 could only form temporary aggregates,
with dramatic reduction in cell viability upon a second
passage.
The previously described report by Silvestri et. al
[38] demonstrated that glioblastoma stem cells (GSC),
isolated from patients and multiforme cell lines, are
associated with an upregulation of Neu4 activity. The
catalytic activity of Neu4 has been shown to trigger key
events in glioblastoma stem cells, including (a) glycogen
synthase kinase 3B (GSK3b) activation, (b) subsequent
suppression of Sonic Hedgehog and Wnt/B-catenin
signaling, (c) downregulation of stem cell-like gene
expression and biomarkers (characterized by a significant
decrease in NANOG, OCT-4, SOX-2, CD133, ganglioside
GD3, and aberrant protein glycosylation patterns), and (d)
a marked reduction in GSC viability. TQ-induced Neu4
activity can target plasma membrane-bound sialylated
receptors such as TOLL like receptor 4 (TLR4) [42].
The proposed mechanism occurs through a cell-surface
signaling axis consisting of MMP-9 and neuromedin B
GPCR, which form complexes with TLR4 to generate a
functional receptor. Collectively, the inhibition of Neu4
and/or Neu1 with OP is proposed to affect the sialylation
of glycoproteins and glycolipids on the cell surface. This
results in a glycome phenotypically similar to that of
differentiated cells, and thus reducing the stem cell-like
glycosylation phenotype.
The potential clinical implications of these studies
suggest that selectively targeting Neu4 and Neu1 could
modify the glycosylation state of cell surface proteins, thus
reducing tumor growth and preventing metastatic disease.
Preclinical data from our studies reveal significant and
reproducible in vitro and in vivo results that OP therapy
decreases EGF receptor over-activity and downstream
signaling in cancer cells and in tumor lysates obtained
from heterotopic xenografts of MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic
tumors growing in RAGxCγ double mutant mice [37].
OP therapy also impeded tumor growth, blocks tumor
neovascularization and metastases. Collectively, we
propose here that Neu1 is a novel alternate candidate target
using OP therapy in restraining the growth, metastases,
tumor neovascularization as well as macrophage-mediated
66129

Oncotarget

tumorigenesis of human cancers. Here, Neu1 forms a
complex with a broad range of glycosylated growth factor
receptors including extracellular and intracellular TOLLlike (TLR) sensing receptors, as reviewed by Haxho et
al [22].
In conclusion, tumor spheroids have emerged and
show promise as a model for investigating growth and
development of tumors, cancer cell motility, and drug
efficacy. The present report provides evidence for the
important role of specific sialoglycan structures expressed
on cancer cells to form avascular multicellular tumor
spheroids and in vivo xenograft tumors. Future studies
should build upon these findings and explore alternate
and novel methods to target the cancer cell glycome and
the unique sialylation patterns of the adhesion molecules
involved in spheroid formation and tumor progression.

(InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) in a 5% CO2 incubator
at 37°C. At ~80% confluence, the cells were passaged at
least five times before use in the experiments. Tamoxifenresistant MCF-7 TMX and gemcitabine-resistant PANC1GemR cells were cultured in media containing 10 μM
tamoxifen and 0.01 μM gemcitabine, respectively, for over
one year, authenticated in Szewczuk’s lab.

Fluorescent lectin cytochemistry for sialic acid
(SA) expression
Cells were seeded and grown overnight on 12 mm
circular glass slides in conditioned medium in a sterile
24-well tissue culture plate for 24 hours. Cells were
washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 20 min or cold methanol (20 min). Following
fixation, cells were washed with 1x phosphate-buffered
saline pH 7.4 (PBS) and stained with indicated lectins.
SNA (biotinylated elderberry bark lectin, B-1305,
Vector Laboratories) and MAL II (biotinylated Maackia
amurensis lectin II, B-1265, Vector Laboratories) at
concentrations of 10 μg/mL in PBS were incubated on
slides for 1 hr at room temperature. Stained slides were
then washed twice with PBS and incubated 1 hr with
avidin-fluorescein (10 μg/mL). Cells without biotinylated
lectins were used as controls. After three washings
with PBS, slides were mounted in cell mounting media
and analyzed with Carl Zeiss Imager 2 fluorescence
microscope.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) was
purchased from Sigma. Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA),
Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) and Wheat Germ Agglutinin
(WGA) was bought from Vector Laboratories. ArgGly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys (cyclo-RGDfK) modified with
4-carboxy-butyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cycloRGDfK(TPP)) peptide was synthesized by Prof. Dr. S.
Burov, Saint-Petersburg, Russia and further characterized
by us [31].
Neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae was obtained
from GIBCO laboratories. Neuraminidase hydrolyzes
terminal N- or O-acylneuraminic acids which are α2,6-,
α2,3-, or α2,8-linked (rate: α2,6 > α2,3 > α2,8) to
oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, mucopolysaccharides,
glycoproteins, and glycolipids. One unit is the enzyme
activity that hydrolyzes 1 μmol N-acetyl-neuraminosylD-lactose within 1 min at 37°C under the following
incubation conditions: 10 mM N-acetyl-neuraminosyl-Dlactose, 50 mM sodium acetate, 4 mM calcium chloride,
bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml, pH 5.5. Specific
activity of neuraminidase (Vibrio cholera) is 1 μmol
N-acetylneuraminic acid per min is split off from human
acid α1-glycoprotein (10 mg/ml incubation mixture) by 1
U neuraminidase.

Sialidase assay
Cells were grown overnight on 12 mm circular glass
slides in conditioned medium in a sterile 24-well tissue
plate. Before the experiment, the cells were incubated in
starvation (serum-free) medium for two hours to reach
the baseline level of sialidase activity in each cell line.
The media was removed and 0.318 mM 4-MUNANA
(2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid;
Biosynth Intl.) substrate in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH
7.4) was added to each well. The substrate was hydrolyzed
by sialidase to give free 4-methylumbelliferone, which has
a fluorescence emission at 450 nm (blue color) following
an excitation at 365 nm. Fluorescent images were taken
after 1–2 min using epi-fluorescent microscopy (40×
objective). The mean fluorescence surrounding the cells
was quantified using the Image J program.

Cell lines

WST-1 assay

Human cell lines (breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 (ATCC ® HTB-22™)) and pancreatic carcinoma
PANC1 (ATCC® CRL-1469™) were purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA 20110 USA) collection. The cells
were grown in 1×Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) conditioned
medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), and 5 μg/mL plasmocin™
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The WST-1 assay, a measure of cell viability based
on the reduction of a tetrazolium compound to a soluble
derivative [33], was used. The absorbance recorded at 420
nm is directly proportional to the number of living cells
in culture. At 80–90% confluence, floating spheroids and
attached cells were added to 96-well microwell plates at a
66130

density of 5,000 cells/well and incubated overnight. The
cells were left untreated as controls for 4 days. Absorbance
readings were taken by adding WST-1 (Roche Diagnostics
Division de Hoffman La Roche Limitée, Laval-desRapides, QC, Canada) as a cell proliferation reagent to
each well (10% WST-1 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium), followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours
before reading at the indicated time point. Cell viability
was presented as a percentage of control, and illustrated
as a bar graph using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The following formula was
used to determine cell viability as a percent of control for
each peptide concentration, where day 0 is when peptide
was added:
[(Absorbance of cells in given concentration of
peptide)−(Media absorbance)] /
[(Absorbance of cells alone on day 0)−(Media
absorbance)] × 100

Spheroid formation was carried out as previously
described by us [31]. Briefly, cells were seeded in a
flat-bottom 96-well plate (5,000-10,000 cells/well,
100 μL/well) and incubated at 37°C for 2-3 h until the
cells attached to the plate bottom. The medium was
replaced with 100 μL of 1xDMEM containing a cycloRGDfK(TPP) peptide (25-50 μM). The plate was
incubated at 37°C for additional 1-7 days.

Measurement of spheroid volume
Spheroid volume was determined from images
obtained with an inverted microscope using 4x or 10x
objectives and defined as a compact rounded spheroid
with a distinct border of diameter ≥60 μm containing
cells indistinguishable from one another. The following
formulae were used to determine spheroid volume:
10x objective images: V = (4/3) π r3 where r=
average radius (microns)
4x objective images: V = (2.5)(4/3) π r3 where r=
average radius (microns)
For the 4x objective images, the formula includes
2.5 to normalize values to the 10x objective images.

Flow cytometry of cell surface SA in live cells
Flow cytometry analysis of biotinylated MAL II or
biotinylated SNA was conducted through staining of live
cell surfaces. Live cells were stained with biotinylated
lectins after incubation on ice for 1 hr and followed with
DyLight 488 conjugated strept-avidin for additional 30
min on ice. They were then fixed. Control cells were
stained with DyLight488 conjugated strept-avidin for
30 min on ice. Cells were analyzed by Beckman Coulter
Cytomics FC500 flow cytometry and CxP software
(Beckman Coulter) in the Queen’s University Biomedical
Imaging Center (QUBIC), Faculty of Health Sciences.
Overlay histograms are displayed. Control unstained
cells are depicted as gray-filled histogram. DyLight 488
conjugated strept-avidin treated cells are represented by
the black-dashed unfilled histogram. Biotinylated SNA
stained cells plus DyLight 488 conjugated strept-avidin
are depicted by unfilled histogram with the dotted black
line. Biotinylated MAL II stained cells plus DyLight
488 conjugated strept-avidin are depicted by unfilled
histogram with the black line. The median fluorescence
for each histogram is indicated for 500,000 acquired cells
(100% gated). The data are a representation of one out of
two experiments showing similar results.

Lectin histochemistry staining of archived
xenograft tumors
Lectin histochemistry staining was used to
determine the presence of the characteristic α-2,3-SA and
α-2,6-SA expression in human pancreatic PANC1 and
triple negative breast MDA-MB231 tumors removed at
necropsy from tumor-bearing RAG2xCγ double mutant
mice, which had received various treatments (oseltamivir
phosphate 50 mg/kg for PANC1 and 30 mg/kg for
MDA-MB231 or untreated). Archived processed tumors
embedded in paraffin blocks were obtained from previous
experiments. An immunodeficient mouse model with a
double mutation in RAG2 and Cγ was used as a xenograft
mouse model of human pancreatic and breast cancers, as
previously reported by our group [45]. The RAG2xCγ
double mutant mice were implanted cutaneously with
1×106 cells and OP treatment was started 10 days postimplantation for MDA-MB231 [45] and 16 days for
PANC1. Treatment was continued until the mice either
died or were euthanized at the end of the experiment.
Tumor sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized, heated for
10 minutes in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval, rinsed
three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in
1% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific Company) for
2 hours. Sections were then incubated with biotinylated
MAL II or biotinylated SNA overnight, followed
by incubation with avidin fluorescein for two hours.
Coverslips were added using DAKO fluorescent mounting
medium. Background control sections were also prepared

Agarose-based classical technique of spheroids
formation
Tumor spheroid formation on agarose-coated plates
was performed as previously described [52]. Briefly, 1.5%
wt of agarose in 1xDMEM was heated on water bath for
15 min. 50 μL of agarose gel was added to each well of a
flat-bottom 96-well plate under sterile conditions. Plates
with agarose were cooled down to room temperature for
15 minutes. Cells were seeded on agarose-coated plates
(5,000-10,000 cells/well, 100 μL of media in each well)
and incubated at 37°C for 1-7 days.
