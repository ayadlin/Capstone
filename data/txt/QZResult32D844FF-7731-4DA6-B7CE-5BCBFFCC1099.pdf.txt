CD44 Attenuates Activation of the Hippo Signaling Pathway
and Is a Prime Therapeutic Target for Glioblastoma
Yin Xu1, Ivan Stamenkovic1,2, and Qin Yu1

Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor that, by virtue of its resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, is currently incurable. Identification of molecules whose targeting may eliminate
GBM cells and/or sensitize glioblastoma cells to cytotoxic drugs is therefore urgently needed. CD44 is a major
cell surface hyaluronan receptor and cancer stem cell marker that has been implicated in the progression of a
variety of cancer types. However, the major downstream signaling pathways that mediate its protumor effects
and the role of CD44 in the progression and chemoresponse of GBM have not been established. Here we show
that CD44 is upregulated in GBM and that its depletion blocks GBM growth and sensitizes GBM cells to cytotoxic drugs in vivo. Consistent with this observation, CD44 antagonists potently inhibit glioma growth in
preclinical mouse models. We provide the first evidence that CD44 functions upstream of the mammalian
Hippo signaling pathway and that CD44 promotes tumor cell resistance to reactive oxygen species–induced
and cytotoxic agent–induced stress by attenuating activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Together, our
results identify CD44 as a prime therapeutic target for GBM, establish potent antiglioma efficacy of CD44
antagonists, uncover a novel CD44 signaling pathway, and provide a first mechanistic explanation as to
how upregulation of CD44 may constitute a key event in leading to cancer cell resistance to stresses of different origins. Finally, our results provide a rational explanation for the observation that functional inhibition
of CD44 augments the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2455–64. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
It is now well established that the host tissue microenvironment provides an essential contribution to cancer
progression and modulates the response of cancer cells to
treatments, implying that elements within the tumor microenvironment constitute potentially important targets for
anticancer therapy (1–4). The tumor microenvironment consists of resident and infiltrating host cells as well the components of ECM. Physical interactions and functional cross-talk
between tumor cells and their microenvironment are mediated primarily by cell surface receptors that are responsible
for the cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, thereby providing
potentially attractive therapeutic targets (5).
Malignant gliomas are the most common type of primary
brain cancer, the most malignant being grade IV astrocytoma,
also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; ref. 6). DeAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Oncological Sciences, Mount Sinai

spite aggressive multimodal therapy, GBM remains incurable, with an estimated median survival of <1 year and with
<3% of patients surviving longer than 5 years (6, 7). Identification of new therapeutic targets and means to improve the efficacy of existing forms of therapy are therefore urgently
needed.
The central nervous system contains elevated levels of the
glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA; ref. 8) and glioma cells
express the major cell surface HA receptor CD44 (9), which
is implicated in diverse cellular functions (10–12). CD44 is
upregulated in a broad range of malignant tumors, and its
elevated expression correlates with poor prognosis of some
cancer types (9–12). CD44 plays an important role in melanoma (13, 14) and breast cancer (15–17) growth and progression, but little is known about its contribution to the
progression of GBM and the response of GBM cells to chemotherapy. CD44 has been associated with numerous signaling events and serves as a coreceptor of several receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK; ref. 9–12), but no single major downstream signaling pathway of CD44 has been defined to date.
The cytoplasmic domain of CD44 interacts with ezrinradixin-moesin family proteins (18) and merlin (19, 20),
which serve as linkers between cortical actin filaments and
the plasma membrane (21, 22). In Drosophila, merlin functions upstream of the Hippo signaling pathway that plays
an important role in restraining cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (23–26). Although still incompletely characterized, the Hippo pathway is believed to be conserved in
mammals (27, 28). Mammalian homologues of Hippo, Warts,

Yorkie, and dIAP are, respectively, mammalian sterile twentylike kinase 1/2 (MST1/2; refs. 26, 29), large tumor suppressor
homologue 1/2 (Lats1/2; ref. 30), Yes-associated protein
(YAP; ref. 31), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1/2;
ref. 28). However, the upstream components of the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway have not been identified.
We have shown recently that merlin activates the Lats2
signaling pathway in human glioblastoma cells, sensitizes
the response of GBM cells to chemotherapeutic agents, and
inhibits GBM growth in vivo (27) and that merlin exerts its
tumor suppressor function by inhibiting the hyaluronanCD44 interaction (32). We therefore addressed the possibility
that CD44 may play a potentially important role in malignant
glioma growth, progression, and response to chemotherapy
by regulating the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway.
Our results show that CD44 is upregulated in human GBM
and that knockdown of CD44 expression inhibits GBM cell
growth and sensitizes GBM cells to cytotoxic drugs in vivo.
Moreover, we provide the first evidence that CD44 functions
upstream of mammalian Hippo signaling pathway and protects GBM cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)– and cytotoxic agent–induced stress and apoptosis by attenuating
the activity of the entire Hippo signaling pathway and that
of the downstream c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38 kinases and by decreasing induction of p53 expression. We further show that purified soluble CD44-Fc fusion proteins
potently inhibit growth of preestablished intracranial GBM
in mice and significantly extend survival of the animals.
Our results thus identify CD44 as an important therapeutic
target for GBM and help establish CD44 antagonists as potent anti-GBM agents. They also uncover the first candidate
signaling pathway whose activation seems to be directly
dependent on CD44 dysfunction and provide a mechanistic basis for CD44 involvement in GBM progression and
chemoresistance.

Materials and Methods
Patient glioma samples and reagents. The glioma tissues
were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network.
Anti-MST1/2, -Lats1/2 (Bethyl Lab), -CD44, -Erk1/2, -AKT, JNK, -p21, -p38, -p53, -cIAP1/2, and -merlin (Santa Cruz),
-actin (Sigma), -v5 epitope, -phospho-merlin, -puma (Invitrogen), -cleaved caspase-3, -phospho-Erk1/2, -phospho-AKT,
-phospho-JNK, -phospho-p38, -phospho-MST1/2, -phosphoLats1, -phospho-YAP (Cell Signaling), -YAP, -phospho-Lats2
(Abnova), and -heparan sulfate (HS, CalBiochem) antibodies
were used in the experiments. Apoptag kit was from Chemicon and anti-BrdUrd from Roche.
CD44-Fc fusion expression constructs, mutagenesis, and
knockdown constructions. Three human soluble CD44-Fc
(hsCD44) fusion proteins were generated by fusing the extracellular domain of human CD44v3-v10, CD44V8-v10, or
CD44s to the constant region (Fc) of human IgG1. R41A mutants of these CD44-Fc fusion proteins were generated using
the QuikChange mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) as described
(16). Several shRNAmir and TRC constructs against human
CD44 and a nontargeting shRNAmir and a nontargeting

2456

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

TRC control shRNA were obtained from Open Biosystems
and Addgene.
Production and purification of soluble CD44-Fc and soluble CD44R41A-Fc fusion proteins. COS-7 cells infected
with the retroviruses carrying hsCD44v3-v10-Fc, hsCD44v8v10-Fc, hsCD44s-Fc, hsCD44v3-v10R41A-Fc, hsCD44v8v10R41A-Fc, and hsCD44sR41A-Fc constructs were cultured
in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
until confluence and were then switched to serum-free RPMI
medium for an additional 3 d of culture. The conditioned cell
culture medium was retrieved, and the fusion proteins were
purified on protein A columns (GE Healthcare Biosciences).
Before elution from protein A column, some preparations of
the bound CD44-Fc fusion proteins were treated with heparinase I (10 units/mL) and heparinase III (2 units/mL) at 37°C
for 4 h.
Western blot analysis, immunocytochemistry, and fluorescein-labeled HA binding assay. Western blots and immunocytochemistry were performed as described (27, 32). To
assess fluorescein-labeled HA (FL-HA) binding, GBM cells
were cultured in 35-mm dishes for 24 to 48 h; 20 μg/mL
FL-HA were added to the cultured cells for an additional
12 h. The FL-HA binding assay was performed as described
previously (33).
Subcutaneous and intracranial tumor growth experiments and bioluminescence imaging analysis of the intracranial gliomas. Mice were used in accordance with the
approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol. Pooled populations of transduced U87MG and U251
glioma cells were used in subcutaneous and intracranial tumor growth experiments as described (27). Briefly, 2 or 5 ×
106 glioma cells were injected subcutaneous into each immunocompromised B6.129S7-Rag1tmMom (Rag1, Jackson Lab)
mouse. For the intracranial tumor growth experiments,
U87MG (4 × 105 cells in 10 μL HBSS/Rag1 mouse)/U251 cells
(2 × 105 cells in 10 μL HBSS/Rag1 mouse) were injected as
described (27). Following the injections, mice were monitored closely and the duration of their survival was recorded.
Mice that showed signs of distress and morbidity were euthanized and considered as if they had died on that day. Survival
rates were calculated as follows: survival rate (%) = (number
of mice still alive / total number of experimental mice) ×
100%. Bioluminescence imaging approach is used to monitor
the growth of intracranial gliomas in live animal as described
(27) using IVIS-200 imaging system (Xenogen). Images were
obtained 12 min after injection of D-luciferin using the same
intensity scaling.
Statistics. One-way ANOVA statistical analyses were performed to analyze differences of the tumor volumes and
growth rates between the control and experimental groups.
Log-rank analyses were performed for the survival experiments. Differences were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05.

CD44 Inhibits the Hippo Signaling Pathway

Figure 1. CD44 is upregulated in human glioma. A, microarray data sets from Oncomine were analyzed for CD44 transcript levels in multiple glioma
tissues compared with normal human brain tissues (studies 1, 2, and 4) or to normal white matter (study 3). B, representative pictures of CD44
immunohistochemistry performed on 14 GBM tissues and 8 normal human brain samples using anti-CD44 antibody (Santa Cruz). Bar, 50 μm. C, expression
of endogenous CD44 in a panel of human glioma cells and NHAs (ALLCELLS, Inc.) was determined by Western blotting using anti-CD44 antibody
(Santa Cruz). Total protein (50 μg) was loaded in each lane. Actin was included as an internal control for loading (bottom). The molecular weight bars
correspond to 197, 110, and 72 kDa.

expression data sets3 (34). In all four independent data sets,
CD44 transcripts were consistently upregulated in human
GBM compared with either normal brain (Fig. 1A, studies
1, 2, and 4; refs. 35–37) or normal white matter (study 3;
ref. 38). In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis of paraffin sections of primary tumors showed that CD44 was upregulated in all 14 GBM cases analyzed compared with eight
cases of normal human brain (Fig. 1B; data not shown).
To address the role of CD44 in GBM growth and progression, we analyzed CD44 protein levels in a variety of human
glioma cell lines. We found that the majority of the glioma
cells tested express higher levels of CD44 than normal human
astrocytes (NHA) and that the standard 85 to 90 kDa form
(CD44s; Fig. 1C) is the predominant isoform expressed. Based
on their high CD44 expression level and their tumorigenicity
in immunocompromised mice, U87MG and U251 glioma cells
were selected to investigate how CD44 contributes to GBM
growth and progression.
Lentiviral-based shRNAs effectively knock down CD44
expression in human GBM cells. To knock down endogenous CD44 expression in GBM cells, we screened a set of

http://www.oncomine.org

human CD44-specific shRNA constructs (shRNA-TRCCD44#1–#5 and shRNAmir-CD44#1–#3, Open Biosystems)
Nontargeting (NT) control shRNAs (shRNA-TRC-NT and
shRNAmir-NT) were included as the negative controls. We
found that two of three shRNAmirs (shRNAmir-CD44#1
and #3) and one to two TRC-shRNAs (shRNA-TRC-CD44#3
and/or #4) knocked down CD44 expression efficiently in
U87MG and U251 GBM cells, as assessed by real-time
qPCRs (data not shown), Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1A), and immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S1B), whereas nontargeting controls displayed no
effect. Furthermore, effective knockdown of CD44 expression dramatically reduced binding and endocytosis of
FL-HA, whereas nontargeting shRNAs had no effect (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Knockdown of CD44 expression inhibits subcutaneous
growth of GBM cells by inhibiting their proliferation and
promoting their apoptosis in vivo. Pooled populations of
the transduced U87MG and U251 cells with different degrees
of CD44 depletion were used in subcutaneous tumor growth
experiments. Decreased CD44 expression in these cells correlated with reduced tumor volume (Fig. 2A) and significantly
reduced growth rates in vivo (Fig. 2B). We observed that the
shRNAs that knocked down CD44 expression, but not the

nontargeting shRNAs, inhibited glioma cell proliferation
(Fig. 2C, middle) and promoted apoptosis in vivo (Fig. 2C,
bottom), consistent with the notion that CD44 plays an important role in regulating GBM cell growth and survival.
Knockdown of CD44 expression inhibits intracranial
GBM growth. To determine how CD44 knockdown affects intracranial glioma growth, the double drug-resistant pooled
populations of U87MG-Luc/U251-Luc cells that express luciferase and display efficient CD44 knockdown were injected
intracranially into Rag-1 mice. We found that suppression
of CD44 expression significantly inhibited intracranial tumor
growth and extended the survival of the experimental mice
compared with the animals injected with U87MG/U251-Luc
cells transduced with nontargeting shRNAs (Fig. 3A and B).
Reduced CD44 expression sensitizes GBM cells to cytotoxic drugs in vivo. The first-line cytotoxic drugs for GBM
are temozolomide (TMZ) and carmustine (BCNU). We there-

fore investigated whether reduced CD44 expression sensitizes glioma cells to BCNU and TMZ treatment in vivo. We
observed that BCNU and TMZ displayed a weak and a moderate inhibitory effect on the glioma growth, respectively,
when used as single agents (Fig. 3C). However, CD44 depletion sensitized the response of U87MG and U251 GBM cells
to BCNU and TMZ and the combination of CD44 knockdown
and treatment with BCNU or TMZ resulted in a synergistic
inhibition of intracranial glioma progression as determined
by markedly prolonged median survival of the experimental
mice (Fig. 3D).
CD44 attenuates activation of the mammalian equivalent of Hippo signaling pathway and plays a key role
in regulating stress and apoptotic responses of human
GBM cells. Radiation therapy and some cytotoxic agents generate ROS that constitute a major inducer of cell death and
underlie their antiglioma effects. To address the molecular

U87MG (left) and U251 (right) cells infected with different shRNA constructs were assessed by measuring tumor volume 5 wk after tumor cell implantation.
B, growth rates of the subcutaneous tumors derived from U87MG (left) and U251 (right) cells infected with different shRNA constructs were determined
and expressed as the mean of tumor volumes (mm3) ± SD. Six mice were used for each type of transduced glioma cells in A and B. C, morphology,
proliferation, and apoptosis status of subcutaneous gliomas were assessed. Tumor sections were stained with H&E for histology (top). In vivo glioma
cell proliferation was detected using an anti-BrdUrd (Roche; middle, first two panels) and an anti-k67 antibody (middle, last two panels). Apoptotic

injections of the transduced U87MG (top) and U251 (bottom) cells are shown in the panels. Fifteen mice were used for each treatment.

mechanisms that underlie the observed chemosensitizing
effect of CD44 depletion on glioma cells, we investigated
how reduced CD44 expression affects GBM cell response to
oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and cytotoxic stress induced by TMZ. Our results showed that the GBM cells depleted of CD44 responded to oxidative stress with robust
and sustained phosphorylation/activation of MST1/2 and
Lats1/2, phosphorylation/inactivation of YAP, and reduced
expression of cIAP1/2 (Fig. 4A and B). These effects correlated with reduced phosphorylation/activation of merlin, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, and reduced cell viability
(Figs. 4B and 2C; data not shown). By contrast, high expression of endogenous CD44 promoted phosphorylation/inactivation of merlin, attenuated stress-induced activation of the
entire mammalian equivalent of Hippo signaling pathway,
and upregulated cIAP1/2 leading to inhibition of caspase-3
cleavage and apoptosis (Figs. 4A and 2C; data not shown).
Together and for the first time, these results place CD44 upstream of the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway (merlinMST1/2-Lats1/2-YAP-cIAP1/2) and suggest a functional role
of CD44 in attenuating tumor cell responses to stress and
stress-induced apoptosis.
Because MST1/2 kinases have multiple downstream effectors, we investigated whether known effectors of MST1/2
also function downstream of the newly discovered CD44MST1/2 signaling axis. Knockdown of CD44 was observed
to result in elevated and sustained activation of JNK and
p38 stress kinases in U87MG cells exposed to oxidative stress,
as well as sustained upregulation of p53, a known downstream effector of JNK/p38, and its target genes, p21 and pu-

ma (Fig. 4D). By contrast, GBM cells with high levels of
endogenous CD44 displayed transient and attenuated activation of JNK/p38 and reduced induction of p53, p21, and
puma (Fig. 4C).
To address the mechanism whereby CD44 depletion sensitizes glioma cells to cytotoxic drugs in vivo (Fig. 3C and D),
we performed experiments similar to those outlined in Fig. 4
but using TMZ instead of H2O2 to induce cytotoxic stress in
U87MG cells expressing a high or low level of CD44. Similar
to their response to oxidative stress, GBM cells depleted of
CD44 mounted more robust and sustained activation of
MST1/2 upon exposure to TMZ, along with phosphorylation/inactivation of YAP that correlates with reduced levels
of cIAPs, activation of p38 but not JNK, and upregulation p53
and its target gene p21 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Together,
these results establish a novel CD44 signaling pathway and
a novel role of CD44 in inhibiting stress/apoptotic responses
of tumor cells by attenuating activation of the mammalian
Hippo signaling pathway and provide a first mechanistic explanation as to how upregulation of CD44 in advanced/
malignant cancers may constitute a key event in leading to
their resistance to stress of various origins, including host
defense and therapeutic intervention.
CD44 modulates ErbB and c-Met RTK-mediated activation
of growth signaling pathways in glioma cells. Our in vivo results have shown that CD44 knockdown inhibits proliferation
of GBM cells in vivo (Fig. 2C). Previous studies have shown
that CD44 is a costimulator of ErbB and c-Met RTK signaling
pathways (12, 39, 40). To determine whether CD44 knockdown diminishes the activation of downstream signaling

pathways induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) family
ligand and HGF in GBM cells, we treated serum-starved
CD44-high or -low U87MG cells with EGF family ligands,
HGF, nerve growth factor (NGF), and 10% FBS. Our results
showed that reduced CD44 expression diminished EGF family ligand- and HGF- but not NGF- and FBS-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 kinase but not that of AKT kinase
(Fig. 5), suggesting that CD44 preferentially modulates proliferation but not survival signaling pathways activated by
these growth factors.
Antagonists of CD44, hsCD44v3-v10-Fc, hsCD44v8-v10Fc, and hsCD44s-Fc serve as effective therapeutic agents
against human GBM in mouse models. To determine
whether CD44 antagonists can be used to inhibit GBM progression in preclinical mouse models, we developed several
fusion proteins composed of the constant region of human
IgG1 (Fc) fused to the extracellular domain of human
CD44v3-v10, CD44v8-v10, or CD44s. Successful attempts to
generate antagonists of RTKs and CD44 using this approach
have been reported (41, 42). Receptor-Fc fusion proteins are
believed to function by trapping ligands and/or interfering
with endogenous receptor functions.
U87MG and U251 cells were transduced with retroviruses
carrying the expression constructs encoding these CD44-Fc
fusion proteins or empty expression vector. Pooled puromycin resistance cells expressed high levels of hsCD44v3-v10-Fc,
hsCD44v8-v10-Fc, and hsCD44s-Fc fusion proteins (Fig. 6A;
Supplementary Fig. S3A). We first assessed whether the soluble CD44-Fc fusion proteins are capable of altering FL-HA
binding to endogenous GBM cell surface CD44 and found
that expression of the fusion proteins reduced binding of
FL-HA to the GBM cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These
cells were then compared with empty vector-transfected cells

for subcutaneous and intracranial growth in Rag-1 mice.
hsCD44v3-v10-Fc, hsCD44v8-v10-Fc, and hsCD44s-Fc expression markedly inhibited subcutaneous and intracranial
growth of U87MG and U251 cells and significantly extended
survival of mice bearing the intracranial tumors. The
hsCD44v3-v10-Fc fusion protein displayed the most profound
inhibitory effect (Fig. 6B and C).
CD44 plays an important role in regulating immune and
inflammatory responses, which affect tumor progression
(43). Our experiments thus far were performed in Rag-1 mice
that have innate immunity but no mature T or B cells. To
determine whether CD44-Fc fusion proteins display similar
antiGBM activity in the mice with functional adaptive immunity, we assessed their effect on intracranial growth of a
mouse glioma cell, GL261, in immunocompetent mice.
GL261 cells form aggressive invasive intracranial tumors in
syngeneic C57BL/6 mice that have intact adaptive immunity.
Overexpression of hsCD44-Fc proteins in GL261 cells inhibited their intracranial growth in C57BL/6 mice similar to
their effect on U87MG/U251 human GBM cells in Rag-1 mice
(data not shown), suggesting that the results obtained were
not significantly affected by lack of the adaptive immunity in
Rag-1 mice and are broadly applicable.
The v3 exon of CD44 contains a Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly motif for
covalent attachment of HS side chains (44). To assess whether hsCD44v3-v10-Fc proteins are modified by HS, purified
hsCD44s-Fc, hsCD44v8-v10-Fc, and hsCD44v3-v10-Fc fusion
proteins were treated with or without heparinase I/III before
elution from protein A columns. These proteins were then
coated on Elisa plates in triplicate. After blocking with
bovine serum albumin, the coated proteins were tested for
reactivity with anti-HS antibody. The intensity of the reaction, as assessed by a colorimetric assay, was normalized

CD44 has multiple ligands including HA, osteopontin, heparin binding growth factors, fibronectin, serglycin, laminin,
MMP-9, and fibrin (9–12, 44) and cooperates with several
RTKs and other cell surface receptors (9, 11, 40). Many of
CD44 functions are mediated through its interaction with
HA (12) that is abolished by the single R41A mutation (45).
To determine whether the CD44-HA interaction alone is
responsible for the GBM promoting activity of CD44, we
generated pooled populations of U87MG and U251 cells expressing hsCD44sR41A-Fc or hsCD44v3-v10R41A-Fc and
compared their anti-GBM effects with that of the wild-type
counterparts. We showed that unlike wild-type CD44-Fc fusion proteins, CD44R41A-Fc proteins are incapable of inhibiting FL-HA binding to the GBM cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B;
data not shown). However, whereas hsCD44sR41A-Fc displayed a weak anti-GBM effect, hsCD44v3-v10R41A-Fc retained a substantial level of anti-GBM activity (Fig. 6C,
right; data not shown), consistent with our earlier observations that hsCD44v3-v10-Fc fusion protein exerts the most
potent anti-GBM effect of the three CD44-Fc fusion proteins
tested, suggesting a mechanism of action in addition to trapping HA. Together, these results suggest that CD44 and especially CD44 variants promote tumor progression both in a
HA-dependent and HA-independent fashion.

Finally, we assessed the anti-GBM efficacy of purified
hsCD44s-Fc fusion proteins in preestablished intracranial gliomas resulting from injection of 5 × 105 U87MG or U251 cells
into Rag-1 mice. Intracranial tumors were grown for 5 days
before the mice were treated by i.v. injection of 0.9% NaCl
containing 5 mg/kg human IgG or purified hsCD44s-Fc fusion proteins every third day until completion of the experiments. Systemic delivery of hsCD44s-Fc fusion proteins but
not human IgG markedly inhibited intracranial growth of
U87MG and U251 cells and significantly (P < 0.001) extended
median survival of the experimental mice (Fig. 6D, left and
middle). GBM and brain issue were collected at the time of
mouse euthanasia, sectioned, and stained with antihuman
IgG antibody to assess the biodistribution of hsCD44-Fc
fusion proteins. Our results showed that hsCD44-Fc fusion
proteins readily penetrated tumor blood vessels and displayed a remarkable intraglioma distribution pattern (Fig.
6D, right), whereas negligible fusion proteins were observed
in normal adjacent brain tissue, most likely due to the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier (Fig. 6D). These results
suggest CD44-Fc proteins preferentially accumulate within
the tumor tissue, which contains leaky blood vessels. Together, our results show that hsCD44-Fc fusion proteins are
potentially attractive therapeutic agents for GBM.

Discussion
CD44 promotes malignant glioma progression and is a
prime target for antiglioma therapy. We have shown that

CD44 is upregulated in human GBM and that knockdown of
CD44 reduces GBM growth in vivo by inhibiting glioma cell
proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, we established for the first time that depletion of CD44 sensitizes
GBM cells to chemotherapeutic agents in vivo and that CD44
antagonists in the form of CD44-specific shRNAs and CD44Fc fusion proteins serve as effective GBM growth inhibitory
agents in mouse models.
Current anticancer therapeutic strategies and target selection are heavily concentrated on frequently mutated kinases
whose activity cancer cells become addicted to (46). Although these approaches are supported by notable successes,
they are hampered by emergence of resistant tumor cells capable of bypassing the targeted signaling pathways through
mechanisms that may be related to the frequently mutated
nature of the targets themselves. It is now well accepted that
therapeutic interventions targeting only a single signaling
pathway, no matter how seemingly important, are relatively
easily evaded by cancer cells as they acquire new genetic and

2462

epigenetic alterations. An alternative strategy may therefore
be to identify versatile molecules that, unlike the key drivers
of oncogenesis, are not central to any single tumor cell property but participate in multiple functions, including modulation of diverse signaling pathways and regulation of
interactions between tumor cells and the host tissue microenvironment and tumor cell responses to various forms of
stress. Based on their obvious contributions to tumor growth
and progression, such molecules are likely to be upregulated
in malignant tumors but unlikely to be frequently mutated.
Selective inhibition of these types of broad-spectrum functional regulators, especially in combination with chemotheraphy and radiation therapy as well as other targeted
therapies, may therefore achieve more efficacious and/or
long lasting clinical benefits. Our present observations indicate that CD44 may be one such target in GBM and our
preclinical results provide strong support for therapeutic
potential of targeting CD44 and potential usage of CD44
antagonists against malignant glioma.

CD44 Inhibits the Hippo Signaling Pathway

CD44 functions upstream of the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway and attenuates its activation induced by
oxidative and cytotoxic stress. CD44 has been implicated
in the modulation of several signaling pathways (9–12), but
no single intact core pathway that mediates CD44-derived
signals has been established thus far. In Drosophila, merlin
functions upstream of the Hippo signaling pathway, but a definitive link between merlin and the mammalian Hippo pathway homologues has not been established. The present study
shows for the first time that CD44 functions upstream of
merlin-MST1/2-Lats1/2-YAP-cIAP1/2 and two other downstream stress kinases, JNK and/or p38, along with their effectors, p53, and caspases (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S2). It also
provides evidence that CD44 plays an essential novel role
in attenuating activation of these stress and apoptotic signaling pathways induced by chemotherapeutic agents and
ROS whereas loss of CD44 function leads to their sustained
activation that promotes apoptosis of GBM cells, which constitutes a plausible mechanism underlying the chemosensitizing effect of CD44 antagonists.
Resistance to cytotoxic agents and radiation constitutes
the major obstacle to successful treatment of GBM. Increasing evidence suggests the existence of glioma cancer stem
cells (GBM CSC) that are highly resistant to chemotheraphy
and radiation therapy and may be responsible for GBM recurrence after therapeutic intervention (47, 48). Although
the implication of CD44 in GBM CSC remains to be elucidated, CD44 is a major cell surface CSC marker in numerous
tumors (9). We show in the present studies that CD44 attenuates the activation of the Hippo stress/apoptotic signaling
pathway in GBM cells and provides a chemoprotective function in vivo. It will be of interest to determine whether CD44
exerts the same effects on GBM CSCs.
CD44-Fc fusion proteins and CD44-specific shRNAs are
effective therapeutic agents against malignant glioma.
CD44 antagonists, shRNAs against CD44, and hsCD44-Fc fusion proteins, when expressed by GBM cells or delivered systemically, displayed potent anti-GBM activity in mouse
models. Human sCD44-Fc fusion proteins may not only interfere with the function of CD44 expressed by GBM cells but
also with that expressed by host cells infiltrating the tumors,
including immune, inflammatory, and stromal cells, which
are known to regulate tumor progression (43, 49). The host
inflammatory response can exert both antitumor and protumor effects, and CD44 plays an important role in limiting and
resolving inflammation (43, 50). We found that overexpression of hsCD44-Fc proteins in GL261 mouse GBM cells inhib-

ited their intracranial growth in C57BL/6 mice that have
intact immunity (data not shown), suggesting the antiGBM effect of CD44-Fc fusion proteins were not significantly
affected by lack of the adaptive immunity in Rag-1 mice and
are broadly applicable. Furthermore, we have shown that
CD44v3-v10-Fc fusion proteins can be produced as HS proteoglycans (S3). It is not surprising that this fusion protein,
which is likely capable of sequestering heparin-binding
growth factors in addition to trapping other CD44 ligands,
is the most efficacious one among the fusion proteins tested
and that CD44v3-v10R41A-Fc, which is incapable of binding
to HA, still retained a certain degree of anti-GBM activity
(Fig. 6C).
Currently available first line treatment options for human
GBM are chemotheraphy and radiation therapy, although
both are largely palliative. One hope for a better clinical
outcome is to identify targets that play essential roles in
mediating the microenvironment-derived survival signal
and -mediated drug resistance and that their antagonists
sensitize the response of GBM cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Our observation that CD44 plays an important role in protecting cancer cells from oxidative and
cytotoxic stress-induced apoptotic signaling whereas enhancing RTK signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4) suggests that
it may serve as an ideal therapeutic target to sensitize malignant glioma to radiation and chemotherapy and to the inhibitors of these RTKs.
