by Macrophages: A Potent Effector Mechanism of
Monoclonal Antibody Therapy of Cancer

Abstract
Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine modern cancer
treatment without targeted therapies, such as mAbs, that
bind to tumor-associated antigens. Subsequently, mAbs can
use a wide range of effector functions that mostly engage the
immune system. mAbs can bridge immune effector cells with
tumor cells, which can result in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Increasing evidence, however, identiﬁed macrophages as prominent effector cells and induction of antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis as one of the primary

mechanisms of action mediated by mAbs. Macrophages are
extremely effective in eliminating tumor cells from the circulation. Several immunosuppressive mechanisms may,
however, hamper their function, particularly in solid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the evolving insight of
macrophages as effector cells in mAb therapy and address
novel (co)therapeutic strategies that may be used to fully
unleash their cytotoxic capacity for the treatment of cancer.

Introduction

for example, an important role in anti-EGFR mAb therapy, which
is effective in patients with wild-type RAS, but because of various
mutations in EGFR signaling routes intracellular signaling sustains even in the absence of ligand binding (3). Indirect effects
require involvement of the immune system. Most clinically available mAbs are of the IgG isotype, which activates the complement
cascade via binding to C1q, resulting in complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC; Fig. 1A, II). Furthermore, through their Fc tail,
mAbs bind to Fc receptors, and thereby bridge tumor and effector
immune cells.
The human Fc IgG receptor family includes several members
(FcgRI, FcgRIIa, FcgRIIb, FcgRIIIa, and FcgRIIIb). FcgRI, FcgRIIa,
and FcgRIIIa are activating receptors, whereas FcgRIIb is inhibitory
(4). FcgRIIIb is the most abundant Fc receptor that is exclusively
expressed on neutrophils. This is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol
(GPI)–linked Fc receptor, and potential signaling pathways via
this receptor have not yet been elucidated. Treatment with antitumor mAbs was ineffective in mice lacking one or more activating Fcg receptors, whereas more antibody-dependent killing of
tumor cells was observed in FcgRIIb/ mice (5–7). Of note,
expression of Fc receptors, including FcgRII, differs in mice compared with humans. Mice do not express the activating FcgRIIa,
but only the inhibitory FcgRIIb. Although the FcgRIIb expression
pattern on different cell types is comparable between mice and
human, the balance between activating and inhibiting receptors
may therefore differ. Nonetheless, it is clear that Fc receptor–
mediated mechanisms of action are required for in vivo therapeutic efﬁcacy. This is supported by clinical trials in which it was
demonstrated that Fc receptor polymorphisms that affect afﬁnity
for IgG correlate with clinical efﬁcacy of anti-CD20, anti-EGFR, or
anti–HER-2 mAbs in cancer patients (3, 8).
Fc receptor–expressing immune cells with cytotoxic ability
consist of neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, and
macrophages. Neutrophils efﬁciently kill tumor cells in the presence of IgA mAbs, but evidence that they play a major role in
current IgG-based therapies is limited (9). NK cells effectively

mAbs represent a promising class of cancer therapeutics (1).
One of the ﬁrst mAbs that was approved for clinical application is
the genetically engineered chimeric murine–human anti-CD20
mAb rituximab. This mAb is widely used in the treatment of B-cell
malignancies and has signiﬁcantly improved clinical outcome
of patients. The success of rituximab sparked the development of
multiple mAbs against a variety of targets for the treatment of
hematologic or solid malignancies (2).
Anticancer mAbs can be directed against the tumor environment. For instance, anti- VEGF mAbs inhibit new blood vessel
formation, whereas the checkpoint inhibitors anti-cytotoxic Tlymphocyte–associated protein (CTLA)-4 or anti–programmed
death (PD)-1 mAbs target the immune system. However, most
mAbs, like anti–HER-2 or anti-EGFR mAbs, are directed against
tumor cells.
Antitumor cell mAbs use a wide range of mechanisms to induce
tumor elimination (1). It is not yet resolved which of these modes
of action play the most important role(s) in therapeutic success in
patients. Direct effects include the induction of apoptosis or
inhibition of cell growth by blocking the binding of a ligand to
its growth factor receptor (Fig. 1A, I). The latter mechanism plays,

induce apoptosis in target cells via antibody-dependent cell
cytotoxicity (ADCC; Fig. 1A, III) and have generally been considered as the main effector cells in mAb therapy (10). However,
increasing evidence supports a major role for macrophages in the
elimination of tumor cells.

Macrophages as Effector Cells in mAb
Therapy
Human macrophages express the activating receptors FcgRI,
FcgRIIa, and FcgRIIIa as well as the inhibitory FcgRIIb, whereas NK
cells express only FcgIIIa (4). Consequently, the correlation
between the clinical success of mAb therapy and the FcgRIIIaV158 allotype versus FcgRIIIa-F158 allotype may be attributed to
cytotoxicity of either macrophages or NK cells. However, it was
also reported that a polymorphism in human FcgRIIa (FcgRIIa131H/R) was associated with clinical responses to rituximab
therapy, which supports a role for macrophages in B-cell lymphoma depletion (8). Similarly, the efﬁcacy of treatment with
antitumor mAbs was improved in mice that did not express the
inhibitory receptor FcgRIIb (5), which cannot be a consequence of
enhanced ADCC, as NK cells do not express this receptor. Instead,
murine macrophages that express the activating FcgRI, FcgRIII,
and FcgRIV, as well as FcgRIIb, were likely involved as effector cells
in mAb-mediated tumor elimination in vivo. We previously demonstrated that anti-gp75 mAb therapy prevented liver metastases
outgrowth of B16F10 melanoma (7). FcgRI and FcgRIV were
involved in therapeutic efﬁcacy, suggesting redundancy in function. As such, an important role for monocytes and macrophages
was supported, as cells of the mononuclear phagocyte network are
the only cells in mice that express both FcgRI and FcgRIV (4).
Depletion of NK cells did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence therapeutic
efﬁcacy when Hodgkin lymphoma–bearing SCID mice were

treated with anti-CD30 mAbs, whereas elimination of macrophages decreased survival (11). Similarly, depletion of macrophages, but not of either NK cells or neutrophils, rendered antiCD40 mAb therapy ineffective in a xenograft model of nonHodgkin lymphoma. Removal of B cells or B lymphoma cells
after anti-CD20 mAb treatment was also dependent on the
mononuclear phagocyte network and required expression of
activating Fcg receptors (6).
It was recently demonstrated that liver macrophages (Kupffer
cells) are key effector cells for eliminating target cells that are
present in the circulation. Kupffer cells mediated arrest and
removal of B or T lymphoma cells after anti-CD20 or antiﬁbronectin receptor mAb therapy, respectively (11, 12), which
was in part responsible for prolonged survival of mice. This
mechanism may be particularly important for patients undergoing resection of primary colorectal cancer. The presence of circulating tumor cells was detected in peripheral blood of patients.
The numbers of circulating tumor cells were additionally
increased during or after surgery, especially in portal blood,
suggesting the dissemination of tumor cells by surgical manipulation (13). The presence of circulating tumor cells moreover
correlates with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer patients (14).
As the blood vessels from the intestines drain directly into the
portal circulation, the liver is the ﬁrst organ where circulating
colorectal cancer cells enter. We previously demonstrated that the
inﬂammatory reaction as a result of abdominal surgery alters the
microenvironment of the liver, creating a niche in which tumor
cells can adhere and grow out into metastases (15). Kupffer cells
were unable to halt the development of liver metastases without
mAb therapy. However, treatment with antitumor mAbs enabled
rapid removal of circulating tumor cells by Kupffer cells, thereby
preventing outgrowth (16). Thus, patients undergoing resection
of colorectal carcinoma may greatly beneﬁt from preoperative

mAb adjuvant therapy. This may also hold true for other malignancies. Circulating tumor cells have been detected in patients
with breast cancer, head and neck cancer, non–small cell lung
carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, and are
generally associated with poor survival (17).
The role of macrophages in solid tumors after mAb therapy is
less clear. Kupffer cells were unable to eliminate established
micrometastases (16). However, anti-CD142 mAb therapy was
less effective in preventing breast cancer outgrowth and metastasis
development when macrophages had been depleted, suggesting a
contribution of macrophages in mAb-dependent killing of tumor
cells (18).
Antibody-dependent phagocytosis
ADCC is most commonly used to describe mAb-induced cell
death. This process involves degranulation of effector cells, thereby inducing apoptosis or lysis of target cells. ADCC is predominantly attributed to NK cells, although it was proposed that
monocytes and macrophages may induce ADCC. Synapse formation between tumor cells and macrophages was observed in
peritoneal lavages of mAb-treated mice (19), suggesting the
occurrence of ADCC. However, recent studies with intravital
microscopy showed that antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis
(ADCP) was the main mechanism of action by macrophages
(Fig. 1A, IV; refs. 12, 16). The liver was the main organ where
B cells or B lymphoma cells were removed after anti-CD20
treatment, as Kupffer cells mediated arrest and subsequent engulfment of circulating cells in the liver sinusoids (12). We demonstrated that Kupffer cells were able to sample circulating tumor
cells in the absence of mAbs, which was, however, not sufﬁcient
for removal. After mAb therapy, tumor cells were rapidly phagocytosed, which was dependent on FcgRI and FcgRIV (16). Kupffer
cells were the most prominent effector cells in a rat colon carcinoma model (CC531s) when a low dose of mAb was given, as
macrophage depletion rendered mAb therapy ineffective (20).
When a higher mAb dose was given, monocytes were able to partly
overcome the absence of macrophages, in which case ADCC may
have contributed to therapeutic efﬁcacy. A role for ADCP in in vivo
clearance of leukemic xenografts in SCID-BEIGE mice after treatment with the anti-CD38 mAb daratumumab was indicated as
well (21). A critical residue for C1q binding and complement
activation was mutated (DARA-K322A), thereby excluding a role
for CDC. In addition, SCID-BEIGE mice lack NK cells. In vitro
ADCP of multiple myeloma cells of 11 of 12 patients was
observed, whereas no extracellular lysis was seen after incubation
of Daudi cells and macrophages in the presence of daratumumab
for 24 hours.
Enhanced in vitro ADCP has been described for multiple tumorassociated antigens on malignant epithelial cells, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), EGFR, HER-2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and human epithelial mucin-1 (11).
Similarly, many molecules on hematologic cancers are targeted,
such as CD20, CD30, CD38, CD40, and CD52. The uptake of
tumor cells culminates in the establishment of vacuoles that are
referred to as phagosomes (22). During maturation, late endosomes and lysosomes fuse with the phagosome to form phagolysosomes. The pH is lowered (4.5), and the phagosome
becomes highly oxidative with generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). It is also enriched with digestive enzymes in order
to degrade the contents of the phagolysosome. With live-cell
imaging, we observed fast acidiﬁcation of phagolysosomes within

5010 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

macrophages after ADCP (16). Both in vitro and in vivo degradation was a slow process as tumor material was still present after 24
hours. ROS were produced as well, but neither ADCP nor acidiﬁcation of phagolysosomes and breakdown of tumor cells was
hampered in the presence of a ROS scavenger, indicating that ROS
were not involved in these processes. In line with our ﬁndings, it
was shown that ADCP of tumor cells by p47/ macrophages,
which lack the ability to produce ROS, was unaffected (23).
Induction of adaptive immune responses
Macrophages are antigen-presenting cells. Exogenous antigens
that have been phagocytosed are presented via the MHC class II
route, which leads to activation of CD4 helper T cells (Th cells). In
addition, macrophages were shown to cross-present exogenous
antigens via the MHC class I route, thereby inducing cytotoxic
CD8þ cell responses (24). It was demonstrated that treatment
with anti-CD20 mAb induced a cellular immune response
(involving both CD4 and CD8 cells) in vivo, which was required
for long-term survival (25). Induction of adaptive immune
responses in cancer patients that have been treated with antitumor mAbs has, however, not been extensively investigated.
Peripheral macrophages are sessile cells with limited capacity to
migrate, and therefore likely do not play a prominent role in
activating na€ve T cells. Nonetheless, macrophages may play a role
in restimulation of effector T cells. Furthermore, macrophages in
secondary lymphoid organs may contribute to T-cell activation
when they ingest tumor cells that enter the lymph node. Intravital
two-photon microscopy revealed that subcapsular sinus macrophages of tumor-draining lymph nodes captured tumor-derived
antigens, resulting in the accumulation of these antigens on
follicular dendritic cells, which were dynamically scanned by
circulating B cells (26). It was furthermore demonstrated that
dead tumor cells were phagocytosed by CD169þ macrophages in
tumor-draining lymph nodes, leading to cross-presentation of
tumor antigens to CD8þ T cells and antitumor immunity (27).
Although uptake of tumor cells or antigens was antibody independent in these cases, these ﬁndings support the possibility that
long-term adaptive immune responses may be induced in cancer
patients, when mAb therapy is optimized, for example, by targeting to CD169þ macrophages.

Strategies to Enhance ADCP
Overcoming the anti-inﬂammatory milieu of the tumor
A tumor does not only consist of malignant cells, but also
contains local stromal cells and a diverse immune cell inﬁltrate,
which together compose the tumor microenvironment. In
general, the composition of immune cells favors an immunosuppressive milieu, as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor
cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are abundantly
present (28). Especially, alternatively activated (also referred to
as "M2") macrophages, which have tumor-promoting properties,
can dominate the immune cell inﬁltrate. The presence of TAMs
has been correlated with clinical outcome in multiple malignancies. High density of macrophages inﬁltrates in breast, head and
neck, mesothelium, thyroid, liver, pancreas, kidney, bladder,
ovarian, uterus, and cervix cancer as well as in glioma, melanoma,
and non-Hodgkin has been associated with poor prognosis (28).
In contrast, high macrophage density in colorectal cancer was
correlated with increased patient survival, which supports that
TAMs in colorectal cancer have a more classically activated (or

Macrophages as Effector Cells in mAb Therapy

"M1-like") phenotype. Conﬂicting data exist with respect to lung,
prostate, bone, or esophagus cancer. The role of macrophages in
tumor development has been extensively reviewed recently (28).
The clinical success of immunotherapeutic approaches is
severely hampered by the immunosuppressive environment
(29). The cytotoxic ability of effector cells, including after mAb
therapy, is limited by the presence of anti-inﬂammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL10, and TGFb. For
example, PEG2 was shown to inhibit CD52-mediated killing of
tumor cells by macrophages (23). Interestingly, it was reported
that TAMs, which had been isolated from murine breast cancer,
promoted tumor cell invasion in in vitro 3D assays (18). Nonetheless, TAMs expressed Fcg receptors and phagocytosed breast
cancer cells in the presence of anti-CD142 mAbs in vitro. Depletion
of macrophages resulted in decreased efﬁcacy of anti-CD142 mAb
therapy in vivo, supporting that TAMs contributed to tumor cell
elimination. In contrast, a recent study showed that removal of
M2-like TAMs signiﬁcantly stimulated both inﬂux of CD8þ cytotoxic T cells and tumor shrinkage after anti-HER2 mAb therapy in
a HER2-dependent breast cancer model (30). In addition, local
delivery of IL21 into the tumor environment skewed the M2
phenotype of TAMs into more classically activated cytotoxic
M1 macrophages.
Thus, manipulation of TAMs may be a promising therapeutic
approach for the treatment of cancer. It was shown that inhibition
of CSF-1, which is an important survival factor for macrophages,
led to regression of established tumors and enhanced survival in
xenograft models of glioma (31). Interestingly, treatment with
CSF-1R inhibitors did not lead to depletion of TAMs, but
decreased the expression of M2 markers, which suggests that
repolarization into cytotoxic classically activated or M1 macrophages. Monocyte/macrophage activation was inhibited by an
IL10-producing B cell subset (B10 cells), which reduced efﬁcacy of
anti-CD20 mAb therapy in a murine lymphoma model (32).
Cotreatment with a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist overcame inactivation of monocytes and macrophages. In addition, blocking the
IL10 receptor proved similarly effective in suppressing tumor
growth in mice compared with CSF-1 receptor inhibition (33).
Treatment with IFNg and a calcineurin B subunit resulted in
synergistic repolarization of macrophages and prolonged survival
of mice bearing B16F10 melanoma (34). Thus, skewing the tumor
micromilieu from immunosuppressive into proinﬂammatory
may repolarize TAMs into macrophages with a cytotoxic M1-like
phenotype, thereby potentially enhancing ADCP after mAb
therapy.
Expression of CD47, the "don't eat me" signal
ADCP is also inhibited by the interaction of CD47 on tumor
cells with the inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein-a
(SIRPa; CD172a) that is expressed on macrophages. CD47 is
upregulated in various types of solid human cancers, and high
expression was shown to correlate with poor survival of patients
with ovarian cancer, glioma, or glioblastoma (35). Tumor cells
that expressed CD47 were less sensitive to mAb-induced killing
(36). In addition, anti-gp75 mAb therapy prevented the development of melanoma lung metastases more effectively in mice, in
which the intracellular tail of SIRPa was mutated (36). Anti-CD47
mAb or high-afﬁnity SIRPa monomers that were used as CD47
antagonists increased in vitro ADCP and in vivo efﬁcacy of mAb
therapy signiﬁcantly, by interrupting the interaction between
CD47 and SIRPa on macrophages (11, 37). SIRPa monomers

www.aacrjournals.org

synergistically enhanced the therapeutic effect of rituximab and
the anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab in a B-cell lymphoma model or
trastuzumab in a breast cancer model, respectively. Thus, antitumor mAb therapy is more effective when the CD47–SIRPa pathway is additionally blocked. The safety and efﬁcacy of anti-CD47
mAbs are currently tested in phase I clinical trials.
The inhibitory Fcg receptor FcgRIIb
To improve Fc receptor–mediated effector mechanisms, many
second- and third-generation mAbs have been developed with
speciﬁc mutations in their Fc tails to enhance binding to activating
Fcg receptors, or decrease binding to the inhibitory FcgRIIb (11).
For example, antibodies against EpCAM with higher afﬁnity for
the activatory receptor FcgRIIa increased ADCP of LS180 adenocarcinoma cells by human macrophages. Similarly, enhanced
phagocytosis of B-cell lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma cell lines was observed with engineered anti-CD19, antiCD40, or anti-HM1.24 mAbs. An aglycosylated mutant of the
anti-HER2 mAb trastuzumab resulted in a 75% enhancement of
ADCP of tumor cells with low- to medium-expression levels of
HER-2. To overcome binding of IgG to the inhibitory FcgRIIb
receptor, it was furthermore investigated whether bispeciﬁc antibodies (BsAb) that target speciﬁc Fc receptors improved ADCP. A
BsAb recognizing the high-afﬁnity FcgRI on human macrophages
and CD30 on lymphoma cells was able to effectively induce
ADCP. However, the use of FcgRI BsAb in clinical applications
was disappointing, presumably due to their short half-life (9).
Alternatively, the possibility to use mAbs of the IgA isotype has
been investigated. IgA anti-EpCAM was able to induce ADCP by
macrophages, but less effectively compared than an IgG antiEpCAM counterpart (11). However, IgA2 anti-EGFR mAbs were
more effective compared with cetuximab in mediating ADCP in a
short-term syngeneic peritoneal model in human FcaRI transgenic mice (38). Outgrowth of lung and peritoneal metastases was
prevented by IgA2-EGFR mAb therapy. Thus, IgA mAbs may
represent an interesting additional option for anticancer treatment, although its shorter half-life needs to be addressed in order
for IgA to reach its full potential.
A cotherapy in which anti-FcgRIIb is blocked with mAbs also
represents a promising approach. Not only may this limit induction of inhibitory signals in effector cells that decrease capacity, for
example, ADCP, but it was also recently demonstrated that antiFcgRIIb mAbs had additional modes of action in lymphoma
models (39). FcgRIIb on (malignant) B cells promotes internalization of rituximab, thereby effectively abrogating CDC, ADCC,
and ADCP, and leading to therapy resistance. Blocking FcgRIIb
prevented internalization, which maximized cell surface accessibility of rituximab, and restored in vitro ADCC and ADCP as well
as in vivo therapeutic efﬁcacy of rituximab. Panitumumab, which
is an IgG2 mAb, furthermore effectively induced ADCC by neutrophils and monocytes (albeit not by NK cells; ref. 40). Because
IgG2 has very low afﬁnity for FcgRIIb, it might be particularly
suitable to recruit myeloid cells, including macrophages, as effector cells, as it will only induce activating signalling.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Macrophages are crucial effector cells in mAb therapy of cancer.
They are particularly effective in eliminating circulating tumor
cells, and as such are likely prominent cytotoxic cells for the
removal of malignant hematopoietic cells after treatment with,

for example, anti-CD20 mAbs (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Movies S1 and S2). However, their potent ability to mediate
ADCP of single target cells could also be utilized to remove
minimal residual disease in patients with solid malignancies. For
example, patients undergoing surgery to remove colorectal carcinoma may greatly beneﬁt from preoperative mAb therapy to
prevent adherence and outgrowth of circulating tumor cells in the
liver. Moreover, the presence of circulating cancer cells is correlated with poor prognosis of patients with other malignancies,
including breast cancer, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer,
and renal cell carcinoma. Although surgery can remove the bulk of
the tumor, adjuvant mAb therapy may induce ADCP of remaining
tumor cells.
Most solid tumors contain a major population of macrophages,
and as TAMs play an important role in tumor development, they
represent ideal candidates for therapeutic strategies. However, to
unleash their full cytotoxic capacity, it will be necessary to overcome several immunosuppressive mechanisms. The combination

of therapeutic strategies that aim to reeducate M2-like macrophages, change the immunosuppressive tumor environment, or
block the interaction with inhibitory receptors such as SIRPa or
FcgRIIb may therefore signiﬁcantly enhance the therapeutic success of mAb therapy.
