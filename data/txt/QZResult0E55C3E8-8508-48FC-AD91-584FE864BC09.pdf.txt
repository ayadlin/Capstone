ABSTRACT:
Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors represent the most common type of
breast cancer, and ER-targeted therapies such as antiestrogens and aromatase
inhibitors have therefore been widely used in breast cancer treatment. While many
patients have benefited from these therapies, both innate and acquired resistance
continue to be causes of treatment failure. Novel targeted therapeutics that could
be used alone or in combination with endocrine agents to treat resistant tumors or
to prevent their development are therefore needed. In this report, we examined the
effects of inhibiting mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) activity on ER-positive breast cancer
cells and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Inhibition of MLK activity with
the pan-MLK inhibitor CEP-1347 blocked cell cycle progression in G2 and early M
phase, and induced apoptosis in three ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, including
one with acquired antiestrogen resistance. In contrast, it had no effect on the cell
cycle or apoptosis in two non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell lines. CEP-1347
treatment did not decrease the level of active ERK or p38 in any of the cell lines tested.
However, it resulted in decreased JNK and NF-κB activity in the breast cancer cell
lines. A JNK inhibitor mimicked the effects of CEP-1347 in breast cancer cells, and
overexpression of c-Jun rescued CEP-1347-induced Bax expression. These results
indicate that proliferation and survival of ER-positive breast cancer cells are highly
dependent on MLK activity, and suggest that MLK inhibitors may have therapeutic
efficacy for ER-positive breast tumors, including ones that are resistant to current
endocrine therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Among these, activation of growth factor signaling is the
best characterized and strategies to circumvent endocrine
resistance have focused on co-targeting growth factor
pathways and ER. For example, drugs targeting HER2,
IGF-1R and PI3K/Akt/mTOR have been tested in clinical
trials as monotherapies or in combination with endocrine
agents for ER+ tumors [5-7]. Blocking a single receptor
or pathway may only be effective for a subset of tumors,
however, and targeting key signaling nodes common to
multiple receptors and pathways may provide therapeutic
advantages.
Mitogen-activated-protein-kinase
(MAPK)
pathways transduce a large variety of external signals,
leading to cellular responses including proliferation,
differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis [8, 9]. Several

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer type
and the second most common cause of cancer death in
women in the US [1]. Approximately 70% of breast
tumors are estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive and
these tumors usually depend on estrogen for growth
[2]; thus, ER-targeted endocrine therapies are useful for
the treatment of patients with ER+ breast tumors [3].
Although many patients benefit from endocrine therapy,
intrinsic or acquired resistance remains a serious problem.
Multiple mechanisms underlying endocrine resistance
have been proposed, including deregulation of ER
activity, altered cell cycle and cell survival signaling,
and aberrant activation of growth factor pathways [4].

studies have demonstrated cross talk between MAPK
pathways and ER. For example, ER activates MAPK
pathways via nongenomic mechanisms; and MAPKs can
mediate posttranslational modifications of ER and its
coregulators, influencing both ER activity and sensitivity
of ER+ breast cancer cells to endocrine therapies [10]. In
addition, increased ERK1/2 activity or p38 kinase activity
is reportedly associated with endocrine resistance [1113]. Thus, MAPK pathway components may be useful
molecular targets for overcoming or preventing endocrine
resistance in ER+ breast cancer.
The mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) are a family
of serine/threonine kinases that relay signals from
cell surface receptors to MAPKs. The MLK family is
comprised of three subgroups: MLKs (MLK1-4), the
dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase(s) (DLKs), and zipper
sterile-α-motif kinase (ZAK) [14]. MLKs can function as
MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases (MAP3Ks) to phosphorylate
and activate Map Kinase Kinases (MAP2Ks), which in
turn phosphorylate and activate MAPKs, including c-Jun
N-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38, and extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERKs). Active MAPKs phosphorylate
multiple nuclear and cytosolic substrates. Within the
MLK subfamily, the best characterized is MLK3, which
can activate JNK through MAP2K4/7, and p38 through
MAP2K3/6. In addition, MLK3 is proposed to act as a
critical scaffold for activation of the MAP3K B-Raf,
leading to ERK activation. Thus, MLK3-mediated ERK
activation does not depend upon MLK3 kinase activity
[15].
Consistent with their ability to activate multiple
MAPK pathways, MLKs mediate diverse biological
processes. Early studies reported that MLK3 promotes
neuronal apoptosis, and that apoptosis triggered by MLK3
overexpression in neurons is mediated through JNK [16].
In contrast, MLK3 promotes proliferation and survival
in other cell types. Overexpression of MLK3 induces
transformation and anchorage-independent growth of
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts [17]. RNA interference experiments
indicate that MLK3 is required for proliferation/survival
of various cancer cell lines including colon, ovarian [15]
and breast cells [18], and for migration/invasion of ovarian
[19], triple negative/basal breast [18, 20, 21] and gastric
carcinoma cells [22].
The downstream targets through which MLKs
mediate their effects are not completely characterized. One
major downstream target of MLK3 is JNK, which, upon
activation, phosphorylates nuclear substrates including
c-Jun. c-Jun, a major component of the activator protein
1 (AP-1) transcription factor, regulates the expression of
many genes involved in cell proliferation and survival
[23]. MLK3 can also activate nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) through phosphorylation of IκB kinase alpha (IKKα)
and IKKβ [24].
The fact that MLKs promote processes such as
proliferation, survival and migration suggests that they
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

might be viable targets for cancer therapeutics. CEP1347 and CEP-11004 are ATP analogues that selectively
inhibit the MLK family of kinases [25, 26]. In this study,
we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of
CEP-1347 in ER+ breast cancer cells and non-tumorigenic
mammary epithelial cells. Our data demonstrate that CEP1347 induces G2/M arrest, failure in metaphase entry,
and apoptosis in three different ER+ breast cancer cell
lines, including one with acquired endocrine resistance.
In contrast, CEP-1347 has minor effects on two nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cell lines. Mechanistic
studies indicate that CEP-1347 inhibits c-Jun and NF-κB
activity in ER+ breast cancer cells, and that at least some
of its effects are mediated through inhibition of these
pathways. Consistent with these data, overexpression of
c-Jun partially rescues apoptosis induced by CEP-1347.
Our data, taken together, indicate that MLK activity
is required for proliferation and survival of ER+ breast
cancer cells, and suggest that MLK inhibitors such as
CEP-1347 could be potential therapeutic agents for ER+
breast tumors, either alone or in combination with existing
therapies.

RESULTS
MLK inhibition reduces cell viability and induces
morphological changes in breast cancer cells.
To determine if inhibition of MLK activity affects
the viability of ER+ breast cancer cells, dose response
assays were performed using the well-characterized,
estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and its
estrogen-independent, antiestrogen-resistant derivative
MCF-7/LCC9 (LCC9) [27]. Cell viability measurements
after six days of treatment with various concentrations
of CEP-1347 revealed that both MCF-7 and LCC-9 cells
are sensitive to CEP-1347 (Figure 1A). Based on these
results, 100 nM CEP-1347 was selected as the minimum
effective concentration for subsequent experiments unless
otherwise noted. To compare the sensitivity of breast
cancer vs. non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells
to CEP-1347, two non-tumorigenic lines, MCF10A and
184B5, and three ER+ breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7,
LCC9 and T47D, were examined. As shown in Figure
1B, CEP-1347 treatment profoundly decreased viability
of all three breast cancer cell lines, but had little effect on
non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell lines. Imaging
of CEP-1347-treated cells revealed distinct morphological
changes in the breast cancer cells compared to the nontumorigenic cells (Figure 1C). After treatment with 100
nM CEP-1347, MCF-7 and LCC9 cells became uniformly
large and flat. A similar, though not as dramatic, effect was
observed in T47D cells treated with 100 nM CEP-1347. At
400 nM CEP-1347, only a few large, flat cells containing

CEP-1347 treatment of the non-tumorigenic mammary
epithelial cell lines. In contrast, the percentage of
phospho-histone H3 positive breast cancer cells increased
significantly, although it did not approach the percentage
of cells in G2/M phase determined by flow cytometry. For
example, the percentage of CEP-1347 treated LCC9 cells
that were positive for phospho-H3 was 9%, but 61% had a
G2/M DNA content. These results suggest that the primary
effect of CEP-1347 is to block cells in G2, but that this
arrest is not complete and some cells enter mitosis.

quantification of cells in the stages of mitosis are shown
in Figure 2C. CEP-1347 had no effect on the percentage
of non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells in prophase/
prometaphase or metaphase/telophase/anaphase. In
contrast, the percentage of ER+ breast cancer cells in
prophase/prometaphase was increased by CEP-1347
treatment, and the percentage in metaphase/telophase/
anaphase was decreased. We therefore conclude that breast
cancer cells that escape the initial CEP-1347-induced
G2/M arrest are blocked prior to entering metaphase.

also investigated. MCF-7 cells were pre-treated with the

1347-treated cultures, 47% of cells were in G2/M at 27
h, and this percentage did not change significantly at 30
or 33 h, indicating that cells were not completing mitosis/
cytokinesis. Phospho-histone H3 staining showed a similar
pattern. The percentage of vehicle-treated cells that were
positive for phospho-histone H3 peaked at 7% at 27 h,
then decreased at 30 and 33 h. In contrast, the percentage
of phospho-histone H3 positive cells in CEP-1347-treated
cultures continued to increase after 27 h, reaching 17% at
33 h. Analysis of chromosome morphology showed that
metaphase cells were present at the highest levels at 27
h post E2 release in vehicle-treated cells, but were rarely
observed at any time point in CEP-1347-treated cells

of ER+ breast cancer cells blocks both the G2/M and the
prometaphase to metaphase transitions.

stained for both annexin V binding and DNA content.
As shown in Figure 4A, CEP-1347 treatment increased
the percentage of apoptotic cells in all three breast cancer
cell lines, but not in non-tumorigenic MCF10A or 184B5
cells. Consistent with these data, increased PARP cleavage
was observed in CEP-1347-treated MCF-7 and LCC9
cells but not in MCF10A cells (Figure 4B). In addition,
DNA content analysis of MCF-7 and LCC9 cells revealed
a large increase in the sub-G1 fraction after CEP-1347
treatment (Figure 4C). Interestingly, a significant increase
in cells with >4n DNA content was also observed, which
suggests that the CEP-1347-induced G2/M arrest shown
in Figure 2 is incomplete, and that some cells undergo
an abnormal mitosis/cytokinesis followed by additional
rounds of DNA synthesis (Figure 4C).
NF-κB and Bax, two proteins with established
roles in apoptosis and cell survival, were examined in
order to investigate the pathways associated with CEP1347-induced apoptosis. The transcription factor NF-κB
is involved in multiple cellular activities and is generally
considered to promote pro-survival signaling. Its activity
is regulated by subcellular localization, with nuclear p65
representing the active form [28]. As shown in Figure

4D and 4F, CEP-1347 treatment inhibited the nuclear
localization of p65 in breast cancer cells, but not in nontumorigenic MCF10A cells. Expression of Bax, a widely
used marker of apoptosis, is negatively regulated by NFκB. As predicted by the decrease in nuclear p65 in CEP1347-treated breast cancer cells, Bax expression increased
2- to 3-fold (Figure 4E and 4F) under these conditions.
These results are consistent with a model in which MLK
inhibition results in decreased NF-κB activity, which, in
turn, leads to increased Bax expression and apoptosis.

c-Jun cDNA, cells were treated with CEP-1347 for 48 h,
and Bax protein levels were examined as a measure of
apoptosis. As shown in Figure 7, overexpression of c-Jun
largely prevented the CEP-1347-induced increase in Bax
expression, suggesting that the apoptosis of ER+ breast
cancer cells induced by CEP-1347 is a result of decreased
JNK/c-Jun signaling.

DISCUSSION
Endocrine resistance in ER-positive breast cancer is
often accompanied by upregulation of receptor tyrosine
kinases or their downstream signaling pathways, and
targeting such pathways has been proposed as an approach
to treat or prevent endocrine resistant tumors. Since
multiple cell surface receptors can contribute to resistance,
an ideal target would be one that serves as an intracellular
signaling hub for several different pathways. MLKs act
downstream of multiple cell surface receptors and have
the potential to activate multiple MAPKs as well as NFκB. Previous experiments demonstrated that CEP-1347
suppressed proliferation of Ras-transformed NIH-3T3
cells but not normal cells [29], and that the MLK inhibitor
CEP-11004 induced a G2/M arrest in HeLa cervical
carcinoma cells and in Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells but
not in non-transformed cells [30]. However, the pathways
affected by these inhibitors and the basis their specificity
for tumorigenic cells were not examined in these studies.
In this report we investigated the effects and mode of
action of the MLK inhibitor CEP-1347 in three ER+ breast
cancer and two non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell
lines. Treatment with CEP-1347 significantly reduced
viability of all ER+ breast cancer cell lines, but had no
such effect in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell
lines. The decrease in viable breast cancer cells was
shown to be due to both cell cycle arrest and increased
apoptosis. After 24 h of CEP-1347 treatment, there was
no effect on the cell cycle of non-tumorigenic cells, but
tumor cells accumulated in G2 and early M phase. The
G2/M arrest induced by CEP-1347 was not absolute,
since by 48 h after treatment there was an increase in cells
with >4N DNA content, indicating that a population of
cells had undergone additional rounds of DNA synthesis.
Analysis of tumor cells treated for 48 h also revealed cells
with <2N DNA content, which is suggestive of apoptosis.
The increase in apoptotic tumor cells was confirmed by
annexin V staining, PARP cleavage, decreased NF-κB
activity, and increased Bax expression. It is interesting to
note that the cell cycle and apoptotic effects of CEP-1347
do not completely depend on p53, since one of the breast
cancer cell lines examined, T47D, is p53 deficient [31].
MLK3 is the best characterized member of the MLK
family, but silencing of MLK3 expression using siRNA
duplexes did not decrease viability of MCF-7 cells (data
not shown), suggesting that MLK3 is not the sole target
of CEP-1347 in ER+ breast cancer cells. Since reagents

MLK inhibition impairs the JNK pathway but
has little effect on the p38 and ERK pathways in
ER+ breast cancer cells.
Depending on the cell type and conditions, MLKs
can signal via multiple MAPKs including JNKs, p38 and
ERKs. To determine which MAPKs are affected by CEP1347 treatment of ER+ breast cancer cells, we assessed
MAPK activity by western blotting using phospho-specific
antibodies. As shown in Figure 5A, CEP-1347 treatment
blocked phosphorylation of the JNK substrate c-Jun in
MCF-7 and LCC9 cells, but not in MCF10A or 184B5
cells. In agreement with these findings, the levels of
phospho-JNK (Figure 5B, 5D) decreased more than 2-fold
in CEP-1347-treated breast cancer cells. In contrast to the
effect on JNK activity, CEP-1347 treatment did not affect
either p38 or ERK activity (Figure 5C and 5D).

Inhibition of JNK activity partially mimics the
effects of CEP-1347.
If the effects of CEP-1347 on breast cancer cells
are due to decreased JNK activity, then direct inhibition
of JNK should lead to similar changes in cell cycle and
survival. As shown in Figure 6A, treatment with the JNK
inhibitor SP600125 decreased cell viability in both nontumorigenic and breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with
the decreased viability, SP600125 treatment induced
apoptosis in both non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial
cells and breast cancer cells, as determined by annexin V
staining (Figure 6B). However, flow cytometric analysis
showed that a 24 h SP600125 treatment caused an
accumulation of breast cancer cells in G2/M, but had no
such effect on non-tumorigenic cells (Figure 6C).

Over-expression of c-Jun in breast cancer cells
rescues apoptosis induced by CEP-1347.
To determine if JNK signaling through AP-1
promotes survival of ER+ breast cancer cells, we examined
whether overexpression of c-Jun cells could rescue
the CEP-1347-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and LCC9
cells. Twenty-four hours post transfection with vector or

are not available to examine the role of each member of
the MLK family, we examined the impact of CEP-1347
on ERK, JNK and p38, established downstream targets
of MLKs. CEP-1347 treatment did not affect the levels
of total or phosphorylated ERK or p38 in either MCF-7
or in the endocrine resistant derivative LCC9 cell line. In
contrast, there was a significant decrease in JNK activity in
these two tumor cell lines, but not in the non-tumorigenic
cell lines, suggesting that JNK activation is independent
of MLKs in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells,
and that other MAP3Ks are required for JNK activation
in these cells.
Decreased JNK activity in ER+ breast cancer
cells likely contributes to the cell cycle and apoptotic
responses observed upon CEP-1347 treatment, since
the JNK inhibitor SP600125 mimicked the cell cycle
and apoptotic effects of CEP-1347, and overexpression
of c-Jun prevented the CEP-1347-induced increase in
Bax expression. The roles of JNK1 and JNK2 in cell
proliferation and survival are complex, and the two
isoforms likely function in a cell type and stimulus specific
manner [32, 33]. Since our experiments did not distinguish
between JNK1 and JNK2, either or both isoforms may
be mediating the effects of MLKs in ER+ breast cancer
cells. The decrease in NF-κB activity upon CEP-1347
treatment may result from the decreased JNK activity or
may be an independent effect of CEP-1347, and it may
also contribute to cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis
observed. This is especially interesting, since increased
NF-B signaling has been implicated in antiestrogen
resistance [34, 35].
In summary, our results indicate that proliferation
and survival of ER-positive breast cancer cells are highly
dependent upon signaling emanating from MLKs to JNK
and/or NF-κB. In contrast, JNK and NF-κB activities
are independent of MLKs in non-tumorigenic mammary
cells, suggesting that they depend on other MAP3Ks.
MLKs may therefore provide novel therapeutic targets
for ER+ breast cancer. The breast cancer cell lines used in
this study included one (T47D) with mutant p53 and one
(LCC9) with acquired endocrine resistance, indicating that
CEP-1347 or other MLK inhibitors may provide useful
therapeutics for a wide range of ER+ breast tumors. MLKs
have also been implicated in ER-negative breast cancer
[18, 20, 21] and other tumor types [15, 19], suggesting that
MLK-targeted therapies might also be useful for a wide
variety of cancers. CEP-1347 was originally developed as
a potential therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, since
it protects neuronal cells from apoptosis triggered by
neurotrophic factor withdrawal [36]. It progressed through
phase II-III clinical trials for Parkinson’s disease, where it
lacked efficacy in delaying disease progression [37]. The
serum levels achieved in the Parkinson’s trials were 20200 ng/ml, and the concentration used in our experiments
is well within this range. At these concentrations,
CEP-1347 displayed minimal toxicity in patients [38],
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

supporting our finding that it is not toxic to normal cells.
The fact that pharmacological doses of CEP-1347 can
be achieved in people without significant adverse effects
suggest that it, or other MLK inhibitors, could be rapidly
developed as breast cancer therapeutics.

rabbit IgG, both from Invitrogen.

Cell viability assay

Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in
CelLytic M lysis buffer (Sigma), supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free) and
phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP) from Roche. The
protein concentration of the lysates was determined by
the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteins (30-80 μg) from
cellular lysates were resolved on SDS–polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed
with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies.
Fluorescence was visualized and quantitated using a LiCOR Odyssey (Li-COR Biosciences).
For analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions,
extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al [39].
Briefly, treated cells were washed in PBS, resuspended
in buffer A (10 mM HEPES at pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors) and kept on ice for 15 min.
Cells were lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 to
0.3%, then centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The
resulting supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic
extracts. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer B
(20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 450
mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT,
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors),
agitated for 30 min at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 20000
g for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were collected as
the nuclear extract.

Cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells/well
in 96-well plates and treated with vehicle, CEP-1347 or
SP600125 the following day. Fresh medium was added
on day 3. On day 6, CCK-8 reagent was added to the
wells and absorbance at 450 nm was measured after 2 h
of incubation following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies). The absorbance of
vehicle treated wells was defined as 100% for each cell
line.

Phase contrast microscopy
The overall appearance of vehicle- or CEP-1347treated cells was examined by phase contrast microscopy
(Nikon) on day 6 of treatment, and phase-contrast images
were taken with a Photomatrix camera.

Flow cytometry
For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed
in 70% ethanol overnight at -20oc, and then washed two
times in PBS. Cells were resuspended and incubated in
PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100
μg/ml RNaseA, for 15 minutes at 37oc. For apoptosis
assays, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS and then
incubated with FITC annexin V and PI according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (BD Bioscience). Cells were
analyzed using a FACS Vantage flow cytometer, and data
were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Ten
thousand events were analyzed for each sample.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and
experiments were performed at least three times unless
otherwise noted. Statistical comparisons are based on
Student’s t test and a probability value of <0.05 was
considered to be significant.
