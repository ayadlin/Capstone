BACKGROUND: The long-term survival of patients with high-risk prostate cancer was compared after radical prostatectomy (RRP) and after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without adjuvant androgen-deprivation
therapy (ADT). METHODS: In total, 1238 patients underwent RRP, and 609 patients received with EBRT (344 received
EBRT plus ADT, and 265 received EBRT alone) between 1988 and 2004 who had a pretreatment prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) level  20 ng/mL, a biopsy Gleason score between 8 and 10, or clinical tumor classification  T3. The
median follow-up was 10.2 years, 6.0 years, and 7.2 years after RRP, EBRT plus ADT, and EBRT alone, respectively.
The impact of treatment modality on systemic progression, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and a competing risk-regression model.
RESULTS: The 10-year cancer-specific survival rate was 92%, 92%, and 88% after RRP, EBRT plus ADT, and EBRT
alone, respectively (P ¼ .06). After adjustment for case mix, no significant differences in the risks of systemic progression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.18; P ¼ .23) or prostate cancer death (HR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 0.68-1.91; P ¼ .61) were observed between patients who received EBRT plus ADT and patients who underwent
RRP. The risk of all-cause mortality, however, was greater after EBRT plus ADT than after RRP (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.252.05; P ¼ .0002). CONCLUSIONS: RRP alone and EBRT plus ADT provided similar long-term cancer control for
patients with high-risk prostate cancer. The authors concluded that continued investigation into the differing impact
of treatments on quality-of-life and noncancer mortality will be necessary to determine the optimal management

KEYWORDS: prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen-deprivation therapy, prostatespecific antigen.

To assist with patient counseling and guide treatment selection, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
has recommended risk stratification of patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer according to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy Gleason score, and clinical stage.1 Although the widespread use of PSA testing has altered the clinical and demographic characteristics of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer,2 men with what is characterized as
high-risk disease continue to be encountered. Indeed, the management of these patients represents 1 of the most significant current challenges in prostate cancer treatment, because the optimal therapeutic strategy remains to be established.
It is noteworthy that several studies have reported effective long-term cancer control for men with locally advanced
prostate cancer who received treatment with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), particularly when combined with adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).3-8 At the same time, the role of surgery in the form of radical prostatectomy
(RRP) for patients with high-risk disease also has continued to be evaluated at select centers; in fact, durable survival outcomes after RRP for high-risk tumors have been reported.9,10 Therefore, given the lack of randomized trials comparing the

efficacy of different therapeutic options for prostate cancer,
the treatment of these patients continues to be based
largely on individual physician experience and biases.11
It is worth noting that the retrospective series to date
that have compared outcomes after surgery and radiation
for high-risk tumors have demonstrated widely disparate
results, with several groups reporting improved outcomes
after RRP12-17; others reporting better results after radiation18,19; and a few,20-22 including a small prospective
trial,23 noting equivalent efficacy. However, those studies
involved different definitions of high-risk prostate cancer,
evaluated disparate outcome measures, and included a relatively limited number of patients, often with short-term
follow-up. Furthermore, it has been noted that men who
undergo RRP are younger and healthier in terms of comorbidity than men who receive radiation treatment,11,24 differences that may further obscure the ability of such studies
to establish the impact of treatment modality on outcome.
Most recently, Zelefsky and colleagues compared the
survival of patients with cT1 through cT3b prostate cancer
who were treated at a single center with IMRT and RRP.15
After controlling for clinicopathologic variables, RRP was
associated with a reduced risk of metastases and cancerspecific mortality.15 However, only 409 patients (17% of
the overall cohort) with high-risk tumors were included in
the study, which accounted for 19 deaths from prostate
cancer at a follow-up of 5 years.15 At the same time, Cooperberg et al, in a primarily community-based dataset, likewise demonstrated decreased cancer-specific mortality
after surgery versus radiation for patients with clinically
localized disease.16 Again, however, only 6.5% of patients
who underwent RRP and only 24% of patients who
received EBRT in that series were in the highest risk category, and the median follow-up (3.9 years after RRP and
4.5 years after radiation) was relatively short.16
Here, we compared the outcomes after RRP and
EBRT for patients who were classified with high-risk
prostate cancer according to NCCN criteria.1 Patients
were treated at 1 of 2 high-volume centers in a contemporary period. With a robust dataset and long-term followup, we report the clinically relevant endpoints of systemic
progression (SP), death from prostate cancer, and overall
mortality, controlling for case mix and patient variables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
After each center’s institutional review board approval was
obtained, we reviewed the Mayo Clinic Prostatectomy

2884

Registry and the Fox Chase Cancer Center Radiation Oncology Database to identify 1847 patients with high-risk
prostate cancer who received definitive local therapy in
the form of RRP (Mayo Clinic) or EBRT (Fox Chase
Cancer Center) between 1988 and 2004. High-risk disease was defined according to NCCN guidelines1 as PSA
 20 ng/mL, or clinical stage  T3N0M0, or a biopsy
Gleason score from 8 to 10. Tumors were classified
according to the 2002 American Joint Committee on
Cancer classification,25 and the Gleason system was used
for grading. No patient had clinical evidence of pelvic
lymph node disease on cross-sectional imaging or had evidence of distant metastases on bone scan.
Surgical Treatment
In total, 1238 patients underwent RRP for high-risk cancers. Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. Surgical procedures were performed by different surgeons
using standardized techniques. No patient received ADT
or radiation before RRP. All men who were included in
this analysis were treated with an open retropubic
approach. Adjuvant therapy was defined as treatment
received within 90 days of RRP and was given at the discretion of the treating physician. Medical hormone-deprivation therapy generally was intended to be life-long.
However, given the retrospective nature of this study, it is
uncertain whether patients discontinued treatment after a
period of ADT. In total, 503 patients (40.6%) received
adjuvant therapy after RRP, of whom 367 (29.6%)
received ADT, 85 (6.9%) received EBRT, and 51 (4.1%)
received both. Salvage treatment was defined as secondary
therapy that was initiated > 90 days after RRP and likewise was administered per individual physician. At last
follow-up, 253 men (20.4%) had received salvage EBRT,
and 415 men (33.5%) had received salvage ADT. The
median time from RRP to salvage treatment was 2.7 years
(range, 0.2-15.4 years) for salvage EBRT and 10.3 years
(range, 1.4-20.2 years) for salvage ADT.
EBRT
Clinical characteristics of the 609 patients who received
EBRT for high-risk cancers are listed in Table 1. Comorbidity status for these patients was assessed using the
Charlson comorbidity score.26 Radiation technique at the
Fox Chase Cancer Center evolved over the study period
from conventional EBRT to 3-dimensional conformal
radiotherapy (3DCRT), and, more recently, to intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The techniques for
treatment planning and delivery of each of these methods

have been published previously.27,28 Overall, 564 of 609
patients (92.6%) received either conformal or IMRT.
The median radiation dose received was 72 Gray (Gy)
(range, 5040-7900 Gy) and was administered in 2-Gy
fractions. Pelvic lymph nodes consistently were included
within the radiation portal for these patients. Patients
were considered to have received adjuvant ADT with
EBRT if they initiated any form of ADT within 6 months
of the date of starting treatment with EBRT. In total, 344
of 609 patients (56.5%) patients who received EBRT also
received adjuvant ADT. The median duration of adjuvant
ADT in this group was 22.8 months (range, 1-108
months). Among these patients, 57 (16.6%) subsequently
received salvage ADT at a median of 3.0 years (range, 0.39.2 years) after initial treatment.
Outcome Assessment
Post-treatment assessments, including physical examination and serum PSA measurement, were done quarterly
for the initial 2 years, semiannually for an additional 2
years, and annually thereafter. SP involved demonstrable
metastases on radionucleotide bone scan or on biopsies

outside of the prostate/prostatic bed. Vital status was
identified from death certificates or physician correspondence. For patients who were followed elsewhere, the outcomes were monitored annually by correspondence.
Statistical Considerations
Comparison of patient clinicopathologic variables
between the treatment groups was performed using chisquare and Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate. Survival
was measured from the day of surgery or the start of
EBRT, as appropriate. Survival was estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and was compared with the logrank test. Patients were censored at last follow-up or death
if the endpoint of interest had not been attained. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze
the impact of treatment approach on SP and survival,
with adjustment for patient age, pretreatment PSA, and
biopsy Gleason score (treated as continuous variables), as
well as clinical tumor classification (treated as a categorical
variable). Two additional methods were used to control
for the baseline clinicopathologic differences, which have
been documented in patients with prostate cancer who

undergo surgery versus EBRT2,22: 1) the analysis was restricted to include only EBRT patients with a Charlson
comorbidity index of 0 or 1, and 2) a competing riskregression model was used to account for competing
causes of mortality.29
All tests were 2-sided, and P values  .05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were done using the
SAS software package (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Consistent with previously noted demographic trends in
prostate cancer treatment,11,24 in the current study, the
men who received radiation were significantly older than
the men who underwent surgery (P < .0001) (Table 1),
whereas patients in the EBRT plus ADT cohort also had
significantly higher biopsy Gleason scores (P < .0001) and
more advanced tumor classification (P < .0001) than
patients in the RRP cohort. The median total pretreatment
PSA level was highest in the EBRT-alone cohort (P ¼ .02).
At a median follow-up after RRP of 10.2 years
(interquartile range, 6.6-14.0 years), 192 patients who
underwent surgery experienced SP, and 404 died, including 115 patients who died of prostate cancer. The median
follow-up after EBRT plus ADT and after EBRT alone
was 6.0 years (interquartile range, 4.2-8.7 years) and 7.3
years (interquartile range, 4.5-9.6 years), respectively.
Twenty-seven patients who received EBRT plus ADT
and 35 patients who received EBRT alone experienced
SP, and there were 90 and 108 deaths, respectively,
including 19 and 25 patients who died from prostate cancer, respectively.
The estimated 10-year probability of freedom from
SP did not differ significantly between the treatment arms
(85% for RRP patients, 88% for EBRT plus ADT
patients, and 81% for EBRT-alone patients; P ¼ .24)
(Fig. 1A). Likewise, the 10-year cancer-specific survival
was equivalent for patients who underwent surgery (92%)
and patients who received EBRT plus ADT (92%), and it
was modestly better than for patients who received EBRT
alone (88%; P ¼ .06) (Fig. 1B). The 10-year overall survival rate, however, improved significantly for the patients
who underwent RRP (77%) compared with the patients
who received either EBRT plus ADT (67%) or EBRT
alone (52%; P < .001) (Fig. 1C).

demonstrated cancer control similar to that achieved by
RRP, with an HR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.51-1.18; P ¼ .23)
for SP and 1.14 (95% CI, 0.68-1.91; P ¼ .61) for cancerspecific mortality. Nevertheless, receipt of EBRT plus
ADT was associated with a significantly increased risk of
all-cause mortality compared with surgery (HR, 1.60;
95% CI, 1.25-2.05; P ¼ .0002).
We also accounted for the baseline differences in
patient age and comorbidity status among the treatment
groups, factors that had an impact on competing causes of
mortality for patients with prostate cancer, in 2 ways.
First, we repeated our analyses and included only EBRT
patients who had a Charlson comorbidity index of 0 or 1.
With this restriction, we observed no appreciable change
in our results (Fig. 2), such that the estimated SP-free survival once again did not differ significantly between the 3
treatment groups, patients who underwent RRP or
received EBRT plus ADT had a similar cancer-specific
survival, and patients who underwent RRP had the highest overall survival (77% at 10 years). Likewise, the associations of treatment modality with outcome did not
change in the multivariate Cox model when only EBRT
patients who had a Charlson score of 0 or 1 were included
(data not shown). Next, we also performed a competing
risk-regression analysis and observed once again that there
was no significant difference in the risk of either SP (HR,
0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.08; P ¼ .11) or death from prostate
cancer (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.60-1.64; P ¼ .97) between
patients who received EBRT plus ADT and patients who
underwent RRP.

DISCUSSION
We evaluated 2 large institutional datasets of patients who
were treated during the PSA era for high-risk prostate canCancer

cer as defined by common (NCCN) criteria. We observed
that both surgery and EBRT plus ADT were associated
with a 10-year disease-specific survival rate of 92%.
EBRT alone was associated with decreased treatment efficacy compared with EBRT plus ADT. Moreover, when
controlling for case mix and patient variables, patients
who received EBRT plus ADT had a significantly
increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with
patients who underwent RRP.
The outcomes noted here for patients with high-risk
prostate cancer who were managed with surgery and EBRT
plus ADT are consistent with the results from previous
clinical trials3-8 and retrospective case series.9,10 Indeed, the
5-year mortality rate from prostate cancer of 3.2% for
patients with locally advanced tumors who received EBRT
and long-term ADT recently reported by Bolla and colleagues8 is nearly identical to our 4% rate death from prostate cancer at 5 years. Furthermore, our data
demonstrating improved survival with EBRT plus ADT
versus EBRT alone for high-risk cancers confirms previous
reports that demonstrated a benefit of ADT with EBRT.36,8
It also is important to note that the median radiation
dose received by the patients in our study (72 Gy) and the
median duration of ADT in our EBRT plus ADT group
(22.8 months) were suboptimal according to modern practice standards. Indeed, it has been reported that patients
with high-risk disease derive a cancer-specific survival benefit from higher doses of radiation (78 Gy)30 and longer
courses of ADT (range, 24-36 months).8,31 Nevertheless,
the radiation doses that we used were similar to the doses
(range, 65-70 Gy) that were used in several prospective,
randomized trials evaluating EBRT for high-risk disease.3-8

study parallel the outcomes reported by Yossepowitch
et al,10 whereas our 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality rate of 15% after RRP is nearly identical to the findings of Stephenson and colleagues.32 One potential
benefit from surgery for patients with high-risk disease is
the ability to obtain pathologic staging, which, as suggested previously,33 may guide the selective application of
secondary therapies. For example, Meng et al observed
that patients with high-risk prostate cancer who received

2888

radiation therapy were 3.5 times more likely to receive
ADT than patients who underwent RRP.11 Because
increasing data have emerged on the adverse consequences
of ADT on quality of life34 and noncancer morbidity35
among men with prostate cancer, the ability to delay if
not avoid ADT may represent a potential advantage to
surgery for these patients. The median time from RRP to
salvage ADT in our study was 10.3 years. Although the
timing of salvage ADT was at the discretion of the surgeon
and was not identified as an indicator of treatment success, the results suggest that high-risk patients who
undergo surgery may have long intervals of ADT-free
survival.
It is noteworthy that, although RRP and EBRT plus
ADT were associated with nearly identical long-term cancer control, patients who received EBRT plus ADT had a
significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality. One
potential explanation for this finding may be an imbalance between the RRP cohort and the EBRT plus ADT
cohort in terms of medical comorbidities and unmeasured
confounding variables. We attempted to account for
selection bias with multivariate regression models and a
competing risk-regression analysis. Nevertheless, the retrospective nature of this study prohibited our ability to
completely account for baseline differences in clinicopathologic demographics. Therefore, differences in age and
comorbidity status may be responsible for the worse overall survival noted among patients who received with
EBRT. In addition, comorbidity scores were not available
for the surgical cohort, which is an acknowledged limitation of our current dataset, although a historic series from
the Mayo Clinic noted that only 11% of patients who
underwent RRP at that time had a Charlson score  2.36
Another explanation is that ADT had an adverse impact
on men who received EBRT. ADT has been associated
with an increased risk of cardiac death, particularly among
men with coronary artery disease.37 Although the exact
mechanism of this interaction is unknown, the metabolic
effects of ADT may contribute to the comorbidities and
risk factors for cardiac death, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.38 Patient selection based
on these medical comorbidities may have resulted in treatment with EBRT (vs RRP), and the addition of ADT may
have potentiated the increased risk of cardiac mortality.
However, it is important to note that long-term hormone
use was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac
toxicity in a large, phase 3, randomized trial of patients
who received EBRT for locally advanced prostate
cancer.31

RRP vs EBRT in High-Risk Prostate Ca/Boorjian et al

Although a randomized trial from the pre-PSA era
reported improved survival after surgery versus radiation,39 that study involved only 97 patients and has been
criticized for its methodology. A more recent trial demonstrated equivalent efficacy between the treatments,
although only 95 patients were included, and all men
received adjuvant ADT.23 Given the lack of relevant outcome data from randomized trials comparing RRP and
EBRT, currently, observational studies like ours remain
the primary means to evaluate the relative efficacy of local
therapies for high-risk prostate cancer. However, the retrospective comparative series to date have been limited by
relatively small numbers of high-risk patients12,19,23 and
the frequent use of biochemical failure (BF) as an outcome
measure.18-22 Indeed, given the variability in definitions
for BF after EBRT40,41 and the difficulty with comparing
BF across treatments,42 we chose to focus on the endpoints of distant metastases, cancer-specific survival, and
all-cause mortality. Determining the impact of prostate
cancer treatments on outcomes other than BF remains
clinically important, because the natural history of PSA
recurrence is variable and usually is prolonged, and BF
does not always translate into systemic progression and
prostate cancer death.43-45
We recognize that our study was limited by its retrospective nature and by the disparate number of patients
who underwent RRP versus those who received EBRT.
Moreover, although follow-up is considered in the life table method, the differing lengths of follow-up between
the patients who underwent surgery and patients who
received EBRT may have had an impact on our long-term
comparisons. We also acknowledge the lack of a centralized pathology review. In addition, we acknowledge the
significant heterogeneity of the kind of risk-group classification model that we used here, although it has not been
observed that this model limits the ability to discern the
impact of treatment modality on survival.15 A further limitation of such a nonrandomized study lies with the varied use of salvage therapies, specifically with regard to the
choice, timing, and duration of treatment. However, we
believe that the nonuniform application of secondary
therapies reflect ‘‘real-world’’ clinical practice, in which
standardized guidelines for the management of failure after primary treatment currently do not exist.
Despite these factors, we demonstrated that patients
with high-risk prostate cancer can achieve long-term cancer control after definitive primary therapy with surgery
or EBRT plus ADT. Indeed, the risk of prostate cancerspecific mortality at 10 years after primary treatment is

relatively low (8%) in light of the aggressive features of
these tumors. Continued investigation into the differing
impact of treatments on quality-of-life measures34 and
noncancer morbidity35 will be necessary to help determine the optimal management approach for these
patients. In addition, further study to identify more effective systemic therapies that may be integrated with local
treatments will be required to improve patient outcomes.
