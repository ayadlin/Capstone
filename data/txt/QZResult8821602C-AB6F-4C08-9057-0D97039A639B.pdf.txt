Abstract
Apatinib, a small-molecule multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is in phase III clinical trial for the treatment of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer and gastric cancer in China. In this study, we determined the
effect of apatinib on the interaction of specific antineoplastic compounds with P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2). Our results
showed that apatinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrate drugs in KBv200,
MCF-7/adr, and HEK293/ABCB1 cells overexpressing ABCB1 and in S1-M1-80, MCF-7/FLV1000, and HEK293/
ABCG2-R2 cells overexpressing ABCG2 (wild-type). In contrast, apatinib did not alter the cytotoxicity of specific substrates in the parental cells and cells overexpressing ABCC1. Apatinib significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin in the multidrug resistance (MDR) cells.
Furthermore, apatinib significantly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]
iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner. The ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2
was significantly increased by apatinib. However, apatinib, at a concentration that produced a reversal of MDR,
did not significantly alter the ABCB1 or ABCG2 protein or mRNA expression levels or the phosphorylation of
AKT and extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Importantly, apatinib significantly enhanced the
effect of paclitaxel against the ABCB1-resistant KBv200 cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion,
apatinib reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by inhibiting their transport function, but not by blocking
the AKT or ERK1/2 pathway or downregulating ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression. Apatinib may be useful in
circumventing MDR to other conventional antineoplastic drugs. Cancer Res; 70(20); 7981–91. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells produces resistance to the cytotoxic effects of numerous antioneoplastic
drugs that are structurally and mechanistically unrelated,
and this significantly decreases the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy (1). The most common cause of MDR results from
the overexpression of cell membrane–bound ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, which actively extrude a variety

of chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cancer cells, thereby
attenuating their cytotoxic actions (2). Forty-eight ABC proteins have been identified in the human genome and are divided into seven subfamilies (A–G) based on sequence
similarities (3). The ABC transporter subfamily B member 1
(ABCB1/MDR1/P-glycoprotein), subfamily C member 1
(ABCC1/MRP1), and subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP)
play a major role in producing MDR in tumor cells (4).
ABCB1 was first discovered in drug-resistant Chinese
hamster ovarian cells (5). It can transport a wide range of
antineoplastic drugs such as the anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and epipodophyllotoxins (5). ABCG2 was identified independently from human colon cancinoma cells
(S1-M1-80; ref. 6), the placenta (7), and a drug-selected human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (8). ABCG2 can actively
efflux a wide variety of antineoplastic drugs including mitoxantrone, indolocarbazole, topoisomerase I inhibitors and anthracyclines, as well as fluorescent dyes such as Hoechst
33342 (9). The side population (SP) phenotype cells are present in diverse tumor types and they overexpress ABCG2, producing inherent drug resistance (10, 11). Currently, ABCG2 is
considered a molecular marker for the SP cells (12). Thus,
targeting ABCG2 in these tumor stem cells represents a

promising and novel strategy to eradicate the entire cancer
cell population.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a relatively new class of
antineoplastic drugs, are believed to exert their mechanism
of action by competing with ATP for binding to the ATP site
of the catalytic domain of several oncogenic tyrosine kinases.
Subsequently, the TKIs can attenuate downstream signaling
pathways involved in cancer proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Previously, it has been reported that
the BCR-Abl TKIs imatinib (Gleevec) and nilotinib (Tasigna)
interact with ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters and significantly inhibit their transport activity (13, 14). In addition, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKIs [e.g., lapatinib
(15), gefitinib (16), and erlotinib (17)], vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR) TKIs [e.g., cediranib (18)
and vandetanib (19)], and the multi-kinase TKI sunitinib
(20) have been shown to significantly attenuate or reverse
ABC transporter–mediated MDR in cancer cells. Thus, it is
possible that TKIs could be used as MDR inhibitors. Apatinib
(YN968D1) is a small-molecule TKI that inhibits VEGFR-2
(Flk-1/KDR), RET (rearranged during transfection), c-Kit
(stem cell factor receptor), and c-Src tyrosine kinases. Apatinib has been used in a phase III clinical trial in China to
determine its efficacy in treating gastric carcinoma and
non–small-cell lung cancer. Currently, no studies have examined the effect of apatinib in cell lines or animal models that
overexpress ABCB1 or ABCG2 transporters. Therefore, in this
study, we conducted experiments to determine if apatinib
can potentiate the efficacy of conventional antineoplastic
drugs through interaction with ABC transporters in MDR
cancer cells.

humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2: the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, its DOX-selected ABCB1-overexpressing
derivative MCF-7/adr (21), and flavopiridol-resistant ABCG2–
overexpressing MCF-7/FLV1000 sublines (22) were kindly
provided by Dr. S.E. Bates (National Cancer Institute, NIH,
Bethesda, MD). The human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell
line KB and its vincristine-selected ABCB1-overexpressing
derivative KBv200 were a gift from Dr. Xu-Yi Liu (Cancer
Hospital of Beijing, Beijing, China; ref. 23). KB-3-1 and KB/
ABCC1 transfectant cells were kindly provided by Dr. S.
Akiyama (Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan; ref. 24).
The human colon carcinoma cell line S1 and its mitoxantroneselected ABCG2-overexpressing derivative S1-M1-80 (25) and
the human primary embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and its
pcDNA3.1, ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1 stable gene-transfected
cell lines HEK293/pcDNA3.1, HEK293/ABCB1 (26), HEK293/
ABCG2-R2 (27), and HEK293/ABCC1 (28) were obtained from
Dr. S.E. Bates (National Cancer Institute, NIH). All of the
transfected cells were cultured in medium with 2 mg/mL
G418 (except HEK293/ABCC1 cell line, which was cultured
with 800 μg/mL G418; ref. 27). All resistant cells were authenticated by comparing their fold resistance with that of the parental drug-sensitive cells and examining the expression
levels of ABC transporters. All cells were grown in drug-free
culture medium for >2 weeks before assay.
Animals
Athymic nude mice (BALB/c-nu/nu), 5 to 6 weeks old and
weighing 18 to 24 g, were obtained from the Center of Experimental Animals, Sun Yat-Sen University (China), and used
for the KBv200 cell xenografts. All animals received sterilized
food and water. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines on animal care and experiments
of laboratory animals (Center of Experimental Animals, Sun
Yat-Sen University, China), which was approved by the ethics
committee for animal experiments.
Cytotoxicity test
The MTT assay was done as previously described to assess
the sensitivity of cells to drugs (29). The IC50 was calculated
from survival curves using the Bliss method (30). The degree
of resistance was estimated by dividing the IC50 for the MDR
cells by that of the parental sensitive cells; and the foldreversal factor of MDR was calculated by dividing the IC50
of the anticancer drug in the absence of apatinib by that
obtained in the presence of apatinib.
Nude mouse xenograft model
The KBv200-inoculated nude xenograft model previously
established by Chen and colleagues was used in this study
(31). The xenograft was found to maintain the MDR phenotype
in vivo and was extremely resistant to paclitaxel treatment.
Briefly, KBv200 cells grown in vitro were harvested and implanted s.c. under the shoulder in the nude mice. When the
tumors reached a mean diameter of 0.5 cm, the mice were randomized into four groups and treated with various regimens:
(a) saline (q3d × 4); (b) paclitaxel (18 mg/kg, i.p., q3d × 4); (c)
apatinib (70 mg/kg, p.o., q3d × 4); and (d) paclitaxel (18 mg/kg,

and the two perpendicular diameters (A and B) were recorded
every 3 days, and tumor volume (V) was estimated according
to the following formula (31):

DOX and Rho 123 accumulation
The effect of apatinib on the intracellular accumulation of
DOX and Rho 123 was performed as previously described
(21). Verapamil, an ABCB1 inhibitor, was used as a positive
control for KB, KBv200, MCF-7, and MCF-7/adr cells, and
fumitremorgin C was used as a positive control for ABCG2
in S1 and S1-M1-80 cells (32, 33).
In vitro transport assays
DOX was added to the medium to obtain final concentrations of 2.5 to 20 μmol/L in the absence or presence of apatinib, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The cells
were collected, centrifuged, washed once with cold PBS, and
resuspended in medium with free DOX in the absence or
presence of apatinib. Subsequently, cells were incubated for
5 minutes at 37°C, centrifuged, and washed three times with
cold PBS. In the control experiments, the apical uptake
reaction was kept at 0°C. Finally, the intracellular concentration of DOX was determined by flow cytometric analysis
(Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter; ref. 34). The quantity
of DOX efflux by ABC transporter was calculated by subtracting the values obtained at 37°C from those at 0°C. The inhibitory effect of apatinib was analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk
plots as previously described (35).
Reverse transcription-PCR
ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression were assayed as described
(15). Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent RNA
extraction kit (Molecular Research Center) and subjected to
reverse transcription-PCR (Promega Corp.). The PCR primers
were ABCB1, 5′-cccatcattgcaatagcagg-3′ (forward) and 5′gttcaaacttctgctcctga-3′ (reverse); ABCG2, 5′-tggctgtcatggcttcagta-3′ (forward) and 5′-gccacgtgattcttccacaa-3′ (reverse);
and GAPDH, 5′-ctttggtatcgtggaagga-3′ (forward) and 5′caccctgttgctgtagcc-3′ (reverse). The products were resolved
using gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose gel).

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed after washing two times with ice-cold PBS.
The protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford
method (36). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes;
chemoluminescence was used to detect the protein.
ATPase assay of ABCB1 and ABCG2
The ATPase activity of vanadate (Vi)-sensitive ABCB1 and
beryllium fluoride (BeFx)–sensitive ABCG2 in the membrane
vesicles of High Five insect cells was measured as previously
described (37). Apatinib was added and the cells were incubated at 37°C for the duration of the experiment. The ATPase
reaction was initiated by adding 5 mmol/L Mg-ATP into a
total reaction mixture of 0.1 mL. After incubation at 37°C
for 20 minutes, the reactions were terminated by the addition
of 0.1 mL of 5% SDS solution. The liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured as previously described (15, 37).
Photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2
with [125I]IAAP
The photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2 with [125I]
IAAP was performed as previously described (15, 37). ABCB1
was immunoprecipitated with the C219 antibody, whereas
ABCG2 was immunoprecipitated with the BXP-21 antibody
(38). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 7%
Tris-acetate NuPAGE gel, which was dried and exposed to
Bio-Max MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80°C for 3 to
5 hours. The radioactivity incorporated into the ABCB1 or
ABCG2 band was quantified using the Storm 860 PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times and the
differences were determined by using Student's t test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Apatinib reverses MDR in cells overexpressing
ABCB1 and ABCG2
The cytotoxicity of apatinib in different cell lines was determined by the MTT assay. The IC50 values were 15.18 ±
0.63, 11.95 ± 0.69, 17.16 ± 0.25, 14.54 ± 0.26, 9.30 ± 0.72,
11.91 ± 0.32, and 19.13 ± 1.13 μmol/L for KB, KBv200, MCF7, MCF-7/adr, S1, S1-M1-80, and MCF-7/FLV1000 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). For HEK293/pcDNA3.1,
HEK/ABCB1, HEK/ABCG2-R2, and HEK293/ABCC1 cells,
the IC 50 values of apatinib were >30 μmol/L (data not
shown). Based on the cytotoxicity curves, apatinib was used
at a maximum concentration of 3.0 μmol/L, a concentration
at which more than 90% of the cells were viable in all cell
lines used in the MDR reversal study. The IC50 values of
the antineoplastic drugs in sensitive and resistant cells at different concentrations of apatinib are shown in Table 1. Apatinib produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the
IC50 values of (a) DOX and paclitaxel in the KBv200 cells,
DOX in MCF-7/adr cells; (b) mitoxantrone and topotecan

ABCG2-mediated resistance to mitoxantrone and SN-38
in wild-type HEK293/ABCG2-R2 cells transfected with
ABCG2 (Table 2). Furthermore, 3 μmol/L apatinib significantly decreased the IC50 values of mitoxantrone, vincristine, and DOX in stably transfected HEK293/ABCB1 cells
(Table 2). However, apatinib did not significantly alter
the cytotoxicity of the antineoplastic drugs in the parental
cells (Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, apatinib did not significantly alter the cytotoxicity of non-ABCB1 or nonABCG2 substrates (cisplatin) in either MDR cells or their
parental sensitive cells (Tables 1 and 2). Apatinib significantly decreased the IC50 values of DOX and paclitaxel
compared with the ABCB1 inhibitor verapamil in KBv200
and MCF-7/adr cells. Similarly, apatinib significantly decreased the IC50 of topotecan (from 10.3 to 0.7 μmol/L)
compared with the ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (positive control) in S1-M1-80 cells. In contrast, apatinib did
not significantly alter the sensitivity of the drug-sensitive
parental cells to the antineoplastic drugs used in this
study. In addition, apatinib had no significant reversal effect on ABCC1-mediated drug resistance in ABCC1 gene
transfectant cell lines such as KB/ABCC1 and HEK293/
ABCC1 (data not shown). Therefore, our results suggest
that apatinib significantly sensitizes cells overexpressing
ABCB1 or ABCG2 to antineoplastic drugs that are substrates of ABCB1 or ABCG2.

Apatinib significantly increases the accumulation of
DOX and Rho 123 in cells overexpressing
ABCB1 and ABCG2
To ascertain the potential mechanism by which apatinib
sensitizes the MDR cells to antineoplastic drugs, we examined the effect of apatinib on the accumulation of DOX
and Rho 123 in cells overexpressing ABCB1 or ABCG2. In
the absence of apatinib, the intracellular levels of DOX and
Rho 123 were low in MDR cells, whereas apatinib significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX and Rho
123 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). The fluorescence index of DOX
in the presence of 0.75, 1.5, and 3 μmol/L apatinib was
increased by 1.21-, 1.72-, and 2.19-fold, respectively, in
KBv200 cells; 1.31-, 1.86-, and 2.44-fold, respectively, in
MCF-7/adr cells; and 1.37-, 1.71-, and 2.11-fold, respectively,
in S1-M1-80 cells (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, apatinib, at
0.75, 1.50, and 3 μmol/L, increased the intracellular accumulation of Rho 123 by 1.91-, 3.43-, and 5.17-fold, respectively, in
KBv200 cells; 1.92-, 2.83-, and 3.59-fold, respectively, in
MCF-7/adr cells; and 2.13-, 3.42-, and 4.16-fold, respectively,
in S1-M1-80 cells. However, apatinib did not significantly alter the intracellular accumulation of DOX and Rho 123 in the
parental sensitive KB, MCF-7, and S1 cells. It should be noted
that S1-M1-80, but not the wild-type ABCG2, overexpressed
the R482G variant, which can transport Rho 123 (39). Taken
together, these results suggest that apatinib significantly inhibits ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated transport in MDR cells.

Figure 1. Effect of apatinib on the intracellular accumulation of DOX and Rho 123. The accumulation of DOX (A) and Rho 123 (B) was measured by
flow cytometric analysis after the cells were preincubated with or without apatinib, verapamil (VRP), or fumitremorgin C (FTC) for 3 h at 37°C and then
incubated with 10 μmol/L DOX or 5 μmol/L Rho 123 for another 3 or 0.5 h at 37°C, respectively, as described in Materials and Methods. The results are
presented as fold change in fluorescence intensity relative to untreated control MDR cells. Columns, mean of triplicate determinations; bars, SD. **, P < 0.01,
versus the MDR control group. Independent experiments were performed at least three times, and a representative experiment is shown.

Inhibition kinetics of apatinib on intracellular DOX
efflux by ABCB1 or ABCG2
To obtain information about the mechanism of transport
inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 by apatinib, we determined
the effect of apatinib on the kinetics of the intracellular DOX
efflux by ABCB1 or ABCG2 transporter using KBv200 and S1M1-80 cells, respectively. The inhibitory effect of apatinib was
analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots in the presence or absence of apatinib. Subsequent analysis indicated that apatinib was a competitive inhibitor of DOX efflux (Fig. 2E and F).
The Ki values of apatinib for DOX transport by ABCB1 and
ABCG2 were 1.98 ± 0.21 and 1.37 ± 0.17 μmol/L, respectively.
Apatinib stimulates the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 and ABCG2
To assess the effect of apatinib on the ATPase activity of
ABCB1 and ABCG2, we evaluated the effect of apatinib on
both ABCB1 and ABCG2 ATPase activities. Apatinib produced a 3-fold stimulation of ABCB1 ATPase activity in a
concentration-dependent manner, and the concentration required for 50% stimulation was ≈950 nmol/L (Fig. 2A). In
contrast, apatinib had a biphasic effect on ABCG2 ATP hydrolysis, as it stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2 at
lower concentrations but produced inhibition at higher con-

7986

Cancer Res; 70(20) October 15, 2010

centrations (Fig. 2B). The ATPase data suggest that apatinib
has a higher affinity for ABCG2 compared with ABCB1 and
that it is likely a substrate for both ABCG2 and ABCB1.
Apatinib inhibits the photoaffinity labeling of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP
[ 125 I]IAAP photoaffinity labeling of both ABCB1 and
ABCG2 and their binding can be competitively inhibited by
substrates or inhibitors of the respective transporters (38).
Therefore, to further investigate the interaction of apatinib
with the substrate-binding sites of ABCB1 and ABCG2, the
membrane vesicles of these transporters were incubated with
[125I]IAAP in the absence or presence of apatinib. Apatinib
produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of [125I]IAAP
photoaffinity labeling of both ABCB1 (Fig. 2C) and ABCG2
(Fig. 2D), with IC50 values of 2.9 ± 0.4 μmol/L and 11 ±
4 mol/L, respectively. These results suggest that apatinib
binds with higher affinity to ABCG2 substrate-binding
site(s) than to ABCB1 substrate-binding site(s).
Apatinib does not significantly alter the mRNA or
protein levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2
The reversal of ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR can be
achieved either by inhibiting their function or by lowering

their expression. Therefore, we determined the effect of apatinib on the protein levels and mRNA content of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. Apatinib (Fig. 3), at 0.75, 1.5, or 3 μmol/L, did not
significantly alter the expression of protein or mRNA for
ABCB1 or ABCG2 transporters in KBv200, MCF-7/adr, or
S1-M1-80 cells. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR re-

sults indicated that there was no significant difference in
the expression of mRNA in the MDR cells (data not shown).
These data suggest that the reversal of MDR is most likely
obtained by direct inhibition of the efflux function of ABCB1
and ABCG2 as opposed to the downregulation of their mRNA
or protein levels.

cells expressing ABCB1 (C) and from MCF-7/FLV1000 cells expressing ABCG2 (D) were incubated with various concentrations of apatinib for 10 min
at room temperature, and 3 to 6 nmol/L [125I]IAAP (2,200 Ci/mmol) were then added before illuminating with a UV lamp (365 nm) as described in Materials

determined the effect of apatinib on the levels of total and
phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK1/2 in all cell lines.
As shown in Fig. 4, the incubation of cells with apatinib
(0.75–3 μmol/L) for 48 hours did not significantly alter the
total and phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK1/2. This
suggests that the MDR reversal effect of apatinib in
KBv200, MCF-7/adr, and S1-M1-80 cells is independent of
the inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Figure 3. Effect of apatinib on the expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in
MDR cells at the protein (A) and mRNA (B) levels. KBv200, MCF-7/adr,
and S1-M1-80 cells were treated with apatinib at the indicated
concentrations for 48 h. A representative result from at least three
independent experiments is shown.

Apatinib reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR in the nude
mouse xenograft model
An established KBv200 cell xenograft model in nude mice
was used to evaluate the efficacy of apatinib to reverse the
resistance to paclitaxel in vivo. There was no significant difference in tumor size between animals treated with saline,
apatinib, or paclitaxel, indicating the in vivo resistance to
paclitaxel. However, the combination of apatinib and paclitaxel produced a significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with animals treated with saline, paclitaxel, or apatinib
alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 5). The ratio of tumor growth inhibition
by the combination was 52.7%. Furthermore, at the doses
tested, no mortality or apparent decrease in body weight
was observed in the combination treatment groups, suggesting that the combination regimen did not increase the incidence of toxic side effects.

Discussion
Apatinib does not block the phosphorylation of AKT
and ERK1/2 at MDR reversal concentration
Previous studies have shown that the inhibition of the AKT
and ERK1/2 pathways may decrease the resistance to antineoplastic drugs in cancer cells (40, 41). Consequently, we

to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Cytokine receptor signal
transduction pathways are pivotal mediators of cancer oncogenesis, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis.
Particularly, the EGFR and VEGFR-2 pathways are vital in
cancer cells and cancer-associated endothelial cells and,
hence, are one of the most extensively studied pathways
(42, 43). In recent few years, many compounds have been developed to block these two pathways including receptor TKIs
and monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR, VEGFR, and
VEGF Trap (44).
Interestingly, several TKIs were found to interact with the
major MDR transporters, such as ABCB1, ABCC1, and
ABCG2. Initially, imatinib (STI-571) was found to be an
ABCB1 substrate, and EKI-785 was shown to interact with
ABCC1 (13). More recently, CI1033 was reported to be a
substrate and inhibitor of ABCG2 (45). Other TKIs such as
gefitinib (16, 46), erlotinib (17), vandetanib (19, 33), and
lapatinib (15) have also been shown to inhibit ABCB1 and
ABCG2 function. Apatinib is a promising multi-tyrosine
kinase inhibitor and is in phase III clinical development.
However, little is known to date about the interaction
between apatinib and ABC transporters.
In the present study, we showed that apatinib significantly
potentiated the cytotoxicity of established ABCB1 and
ABCG2 substrates and increased the accumulation of DOX
and Rho 123 in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. However, apatinib at 3.0 μmol/L did not significantly sensitize the
parental sensitive KB, MCF-7, S1, or HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

to the anticancer agents used in this study (Tables 1 and 2).
These findings suggest that the sensitization of the resistant
cells by apatinib is specific to overexpression of ABCB1 or
ABCG2. Furthermore, apatinib significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of DOX and Rho 123 in MDR cells.
The results of the fluorescent drug accumulation studies
were consistent with our cytotoxic results, suggesting that
apatinib sensitizes the ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR
cells to anticancer drugs. The downregulation of ABCB1
and ABCG2 expression on treatment with apatinib could
have potentiated the reversal effect of apatinib on ABCB1and ABCG2-mediated MDR. However, protein expression of
ABCB1 or ABCG2 in the corresponding resistant cells was not
affected by a 48-h treatment with 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 μmol/L
apatinib (Fig. 3). We thus proposed that the MDR reversal effect of apatinib is due to the inhibition of the efflux function
of the ABC transporters as revealed in the drug accumulation
assay (Fig. 1). To examine whether apatinib can also reverse
MDR in vivo, we investigated the effect of apatinib on the
anticancer activity of paclitaxel in the nude mouse xenograft
model. We found that the combination of paclitaxel with apatinib remarkably enhanced the anticancer activity of paclitaxel in our ABCB1-overexpressing xenograft model (Fig. 5).
However, there was no substantial increased loss of body
weight in mice treated with the drug combination compared
with the individual drug treatment alone.
ABC transporters move substrates out of cells using ATP
as the energy source. Therefore, the rate of ATP hydrolysis

(ATPase activity) is directly proportional to the transport activity of the transporters (47). We have previously reported
that some TKIs such as lapatinib, sunitinib, and erlotinib,
even at low concentrations, can stimulate the ATPase activities of the transporters (15, 17, 48). In fact, apatinib stimulated both Vi-sensitive ABCB1 and BeFx-sensitive ABCG2
ATPase at lower concentrations, as seen with the aforementioned TKIs (Fig. 2A and B), but inhibited BeFx-sensitive
ABCG2 ATPase at higher concentrations (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that apatinib is likely to be a substrate of both
ABCB1 and ABCG2. In addition, we speculate, based on these
findings, that apatinib has a direct interaction with these
transporters. Further experiments showed that apatinib inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with
[ 125I]IAAP, definitively illustrating the direct interaction
between apatinib and these transporters. Taken together,
these data suggest that apatinib reverses MDR by directly
inhibiting the function of ABC drug transporters.
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as VEGFR, plateletderived growth factor receptor, and FLT3 play crucial role in
modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival by
activating downstream signal molecules such as signal transducers and activators of transcription, protein kinase B/AKT,
and ERK1/2 (49). Aberrant activation of different RTKs is believed to be associated with cancer growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis. Moreover, it has been reported that activation of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and/or ERK pathways
is related to resistance to conventional anticancer drugs (50).
To rule out the involvement of the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways in the MDR reversal of apatinib, activation of AKT
and ERK1/2 was examined. Our data showed that apatinib
(up to 3.0 μmol/L) did not block the phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK1/2 in all the cell lines tested (Fig. 4). Therefore,

blockade of AKT and ERK1/2 activation is not involved in the
reversal of ABCB1- or ABCG2-mediated MDR by apatinib.
In conclusion, apatinib reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2mediated MDR by directly inhibiting ABCB1 and ABCG2
function, resulting in elevated intracellular concentrations
of substrate chemotherapeutic drugs. Also, the reversal of
MDR is not associated with the blockade of tyrosine kinases.
Confirmation of MDR reversal by apatinib in tumor xenograft model further supports the potential usefulness of combining apatinib with other conventional anticancer drugs in
overcoming clinical resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
