BACKGROUND: Ezatiostat is a glutathione analog prodrug glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) inhibitor. This
study evaluated 2 extended dose schedules of oral ezatiostat in 89 heavily pretreated patients with low to intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: Patients were randomized by 1 stratification factor—baseline
cytopenia (anemia only vs anemia with additional cytopenias)—to 1 of 2 extended dosing schedules. Multilineage hematologic improvement (HI) responses were assessed by International Working Group 2006 criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 11 of 38 (29%) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients had HI-Erythroid (HI-E) response. The median
duration of HI-E response was 34 weeks. Multilineage responses were observed. There was 1 cytogenetic complete
response in a del (5q) MDS patient. An important trend was the effect of prior therapy on response. A 40% HI-E rate
(6 of 15 patients) was observed in patients who had prior lenalidomide and no prior hypomethylating agents (HMAs),
with 5 of 11 (45%) patients achieving significant RBC transfusion reduction and 3 of 11 (27%) achieving transfusion independence. A 28% HI-E rate (5 of 18 patients) was observed in patients who were both lenalidomide and HMA naive,
with 4 of 8 (50%) patients achieving clinically significant RBC transfusion reductions. Most common ezatiostatrelated adverse events were grade 1 and 2 gastrointestinal including: nausea (45%, 17%), diarrhea (26%, 7%), and
vomiting (30%, 12%). CONCLUSIONS: Ezatiostat is the first GSTP1-1 inhibitor shown to cause clinically significant and
sustained reduction in RBC transfusions, transfusion independence, and multilineage responses in MDS patients. The
tolerability and activity profile of ezatiostat may offer a new treatment option for patients with MDS. Cancer 2012;

INTRODUCTION

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by dysplasia of 1
or more cell lineages, ineffective hematopoiesis, and cytopenias. MDS defects in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis
are associated with a 30% incidence of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).1 The estimated incidence
rate is 3.4 per 100,000 per year, rising to 30 per 100,000 per year for people over 70 years of age.2 Although the natural
history of distinct subtypes of myelodysplasia ranges from indolent chronic anemia to rapid progression to AML, most
patients eventually die from complications of bone marrow failure. Two-thirds of MDS patients at diagnosis have low or
intermediate-1 risk disease by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS),3 with the primary goal of therapy being
improved hematopoiesis. Management of cytopenias ranges from supportive care measures to the use of disease-modifying

agents. Of the 3 US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved drugs available for the treatment of
MDS, the lenalidomide label is specific for lower risk red
blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients with the
deletion 5q (del 5q) MDS cytogenetic abnormality,
although 26% of such patients without this chromosome
abnormality also achieve transfusion independence.4 The
2 hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are beneficial for
patients with higher risk MDS. Therapies are urgently
needed for the lower risk MDS patients, particularly those
failing other treatment approaches.
Ezatiostat hydrochloride (TelintraV, TLK199), a
tripeptide glutathione analog reversible inhibitor of the
enzyme glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1), is
being developed for the treatment of cytopenias associated with lower risk MDS. Ezatiostat facilitates dissociation of GSTP1-1 from jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK),
leading to activation of JNK and the subsequent promotion of growth and maturation of multilineage hematopoietic progenitors, while promoting apoptosis in
human leukemia blasts.5 The role of apoptosis in MDS
remains complicated. Some studies show a defect in apoptosis, and clearly the progression to acute leukemia
may argue for a role for these, and other, defects in apoptotic pathways in certain premalignant clones. The
ability of ezatiostat to activate the caspase-dependent
pathway may help eliminate or inhibit the emergence of
malignant clones. Alternatively, ezatiostat’s ability to
increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in dysplastic cells
may also contribute to apoptotic death and elimination,
because MDS cells may lack the reducing ability to
eliminate these oxidative stresses.6 On the basis of
promising multilineage responses and good tolerability
profile in low to intermediate-2 MDS patients in a
phase 1 study of oral ezatiostat,7 as well as the results of
a phase 1 to 2a proof-of-concept study with the intravenous formulation,8 this randomized multicenter phase 2
study of oral ezatiostat on extended dose schedules was
conducted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical
Practice standards. Institutional review board approval
was obtained from all participating institutions. All
patients provided written informed consent before study
participation.

Eligible patients were age 18 years, with histologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
of 0 or 1. Patients were required to have adequate hepatic
and renal function. Inclusion criteria included cytopenia
per the International Working Group 2006 (IWG 2006)
criteria9 for >2 months and ineligibility for stem cell
bone marrow transplantation. Patients were excluded for
prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, higher risk
MDS or AML, cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with
de novo AML,10,11 proliferative chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis, use
of oral corticosteroids (>10 mg), history of hepatitis B/C,
human immunodeficiency virus, or an active infection
requiring intravenous antibiotics. Patients were not
allowed to receive growth factors while on study, and a 4week washout period for growth factors was required
before study enrollment.
Study Design
This was a randomized, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluating 2 extended dose schedules of oral ezatiostat in
patients with low to intermediate-1 IPSS risk MDS.12
The hematologic improvement (HI) rates for erythroid (E), neutrophils (N), and platelets (P) by IWG
2006 criteria, safety, and tolerability on each treatment
dose schedule were evaluated to select the optimal
extended dose and dose schedule for future studies. After
randomization of the initial 14 patients at the 4500-mg
dose on 2 dose schedules, subsequent patients were
randomized to 2 selected lower doses/dose schedules to
improve tolerability and patient convenience.
Patients were randomized by 1 stratification factorbaseline cytopenia (anemia only vs anemia with additional
cytopenias) to either dose schedule 1 (DS1) or dose schedule 2 (DS2). In DS1, patients received 1500 mg orally
(p.o.) twice daily (b.i.d.) for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week
rest period in a 3-week treatment cycle, and in DS2,
patients received 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. for 3 weeks followed
by a 1-week rest period on a 4-week treatment cycle. Divided daily doses were administered approximately every
12 hours, 1 tablet at a time with adequate fluids. The
randomized treatment was planned for a maximum of 6
months; however, upon completion of 6 months of therapy, patients with ongoing clinical benefit and good tolerability were allowed to continue for an additional 6
months of continuous daily dosing.
Patients were treated until MDS disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study. Red

blood cell (RBC) transfusion guidelines were provided in
the protocol and RBC transfusions were to be given for a
hemoglobin (Hgb) level 9.0 g/dL. All treated patients
were monitored for safety and efficacy with physical and
laboratory examinations, and hematologic response
assessments (IWG 2006) were evaluated every 2 cycles.9
Adverse events (AEs) were graded in accordance with the
National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v3.0; Bethesda, MD).13
Drug Formulation
Ezatiostat is formulated as 500 mg tablets. Each tablet
contains ezatiostat hydrochloride with the following excipients: mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose,
magnesium stearate, and Opadry Clear. (Opradry Clear is
a mixture of hypromellose and polyethylene glycol 400.)
Assessments
On day 1 of each treatment cycle, a physical examination
and laboratory assessments (complete blood count [CBC]
with differential, platelet count, and chemistry profile)
were obtained, use of concomitant medication(s) was
documented, AEs were assessed, and RBC transfusion
requirements were documented. CBC with differential
and platelet count was obtained weekly.
Dose Modifications
Patients who experienced a treatment-related nonhematologic AE grade 3 or higher had treatment delayed for up
to 3 weeks or until recovery to grade 1 or baseline and subsequent treatment resumed at a dose reduced by the
amount of 500 mg (1 tablet) per day. If recovery did not
occur after a delay of 21 days, treatment was discontinued
and patients were followed until resolution of the AE.
Statistical Analysis
With 1-sided 5% significance level, 38 patients in each
dose schedule ensured approximately 90% power to test
for a 20% HI-E response rate in each treatment arm versus a 5% HI-E response rate in the null hypothesis. The
primary endpoint of the study was the hematologic
improvement response rate in the erythroid cell line (HIE) by the IWG MDS criteria (2006) in the efficacy evaluable (EE) population. The HI-E response rate was also calculated in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. All
randomized patients were included in the ITT population.
All randomized patients who received any amount of ezatiostat treatment were included in the safety population.

2140

Patients who received at least 2 cycles of ezatiostat treatment and for whom an HI response assessment was completed were included in the EE population. All responses
were reviewed and confirmed. Efficacy analyses were performed in the ITT and the EE populations overall and by
the 2 selected dose schedules. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided for response rates.
Rate comparisons were performed using Cochran-MantelHaenszel test stratified by significant confounders or Fisher’s exact tests when applicable. Multiple comparisons
were not addressed in this phase 2 study.
Time to response and duration of response were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Hematologic improvement-erythroid is defined as: 1) RBC transfusiondependent patients who experience a transfusion reduction by 4 units from baseline over 8 weeks after the initiation of study treatment (given for Hgb 9.0 g/dL); or
2) Patients with symptomatic anemia with Hgb <10 g/dL
at baseline who experienced an Hgb increase by 1.5 g/
dL sustained for a period of 8 weeks.
RBC transfusion independence is defined as no
RBC transfusions required over an 8-week period. Time
to HI-E response is calculated from the day of the initiation of study treatment to the end day of the 8-week period when an HI-E is declared. Time to RBC transfusion
independence is calculated from the day of the initiation
of study treatment to the end day of an 8-week period free
of transfusions. Duration of HI-E response is calculated
from the end day of the 8-week period when an HI-E is
declared to the first day when an HI-E criterion is no longer met. Duration of RBC transfusion independence is
calculated from the last day after an 8-week period free of
transfusions to the date a RBC transfusion is required.
These duration-of-response definitions pertain only when
transfusion reduction or independence has been sustained
beyond 8 weeks, per IWG 2006 criteria.
A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis
was conducted to identify significant MDS disease factors
associated with HI-E rates, including prior MDS treatment, age, gender, IPSS, ECOG PS, years from MDS diagnosis, MDS World Health Organization (WHO)
subtypes, anemia only versus anemia plus other cytopenias, dose schedule, and starting dose.

were randomized to either ezatiostat at 4500 mg total
dose daily in divided doses p.o. b.i.d. days 1-14 followed
by a 1-week rest per 3-week cycle (DS1) or 4500 mg total
dose daily in divided doses p.o. b.i.d. days 1-21 followed
by a 1-week rest in a 4-week cycle (DS2). Upon review of
the initial 14-patient data, 2 lower doses were selected for
randomized treatment of the subsequent 75 patients. Seventy-three patients were treated on the 2 selected ezatiostat dose schedules, with 37 patients at 3000 mg daily in
divided doses (1500 mg p.o. b.i.d.) on DS1 (3-week cycle)

Ezatiostat Tablets Study Treatment
Administration
Eighty-seven of 89 patients were treated (Table 3). A total
of 447 cycles were administered, with the median number
of 4 cycles per patient. Dose reductions were infrequent,
with only 3% of all cycles requiring dose reduction and
9% of all cycles requiring a dose delay. Dose reductions
were due to nausea (9 cycles), diarrhea (3 cycles), vomiting
(3 cycles), fatigue (2 cycles), and abdominal distension,
back pain, fatigue, dizziness, principal investigator discretion, platelet count increased (1 cycle each). Six patients
discontinued treatment with ezatiostat due to ezatiostatrelated AEs.

Safety
Ezatiostat was generally well tolerated, and the most common treatment-related AEs were nonhematologic, grade 1
and 2 gastrointestinal (GI) including nausea (45%, 17%),
diarrhea (26%, 7%), and vomiting (30%, 12%). Grade 3
events were nausea (1%), diarrhea (3%), and vomiting
(2%) (Table 4). Ezatiostat-related AEs in general
appeared to be related to dose, with the 4500 mg/day
starting dose being associated with the highest incidence
of AEs and the 2000 mg/day starting dose associated with
the lowest incidence of AEs. However, prior HMA treatment appeared to be associated with an increased incidence of ezatiostat-related AEs. Patients with prior HMA
use had GI AEs (grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively): nausea
(51%, 20%, 2%), vomiting (34%, 7%, 2%), diarrhea
(22%, 10%, 5%). HMA-naive patients had fewer GI AEs
(grades 1, 2, 3): nausea (39%, 15%, 0%), vomiting (26%,
15%, 2%), diarrhea (30%, 4%, 2%). This observation
was also true of all treatment-emergent GI AEs regardless
of ezatiostat treatment relatedness.
The incidence of overall grade 1 and grade 2 ezatiostat-related abnormal skin odor was 9 of 87 (10%) and 8
of 87 (9%), respectively. Prior HMA treated patients had
significantly increased incidence and severity of abnormal

2144

skin odor (P ¼ .0386). Patients with prior HMA treatment had grade 1 and grade 2 abnormal skin order, 4 of
41 (10%) and 7 of 41 (17%), respectively, compared with
HMA-naive patients, 5 of 46 (11%) and 1 of 46 (2%),
respectively.
There were a total of 11 ezatiostat possibly treatment-related serious adverse events. Of these 11 possibly
treatment-related events, there were 2 events of gastritis/
gastroenteritis, 2 events of fever, 2 events of diarrhea, and
1 event each with abdominal pain, pneumonia, vomiting,
dizziness, and pulmonary embolism. These events
resolved without sequelae.
Efficacy
Seventy-five patients were in the ITT population on the 2
selected dose and dose schedules and 61 patients were in
the EE population. The HI-E response rate was similar
for the EE (22%) and ITT (19%) populations. The HI-E
response rate was also similar for the evaluable patients on
the 2 dose schedules (P ¼ .76); therefore, the data were
pooled (Table 5). The overall HI-E rate was 22% (13 of
60 patients; 95% CI, 12-34) as protocol-targeted for this
heavily prior treated population. Eleven (29%) of 38
RBC transfusion-dependent patients had transfusion

reductions (4 units/8 weeks), with 4 (11%) patients
achieving transfusion independence. The maximum Hgb
during the HI-E responding period was a median of 10
mg/dL (range, 8-15) with a median of 8 mg/dL (range,
7-10) at baseline. The IWG 2006 criteria time-toresponse and duration-of-response definitions pertain to
transfusion reduction or independence after it had been
sustained beyond 8 weeks; this is the more stringent criteria, because it does not include the first 8 weeks of
response in the calculation. The median duration of
response was 34 weeks. However, exposure time was
observed to be important, as the median duration of
response was 18 weeks on DS1 and 46 weeks on DS2,
respectively. The lower dose, longer exposure time dose
schedule was observed to have a longer duration of
response. The median time to HI-E response was 8 weeks
(range, 8-11). A 19% HI-N response rate was observed in
patients with neutropenia (4 of 21; 95% CI, 5-42) and a
bilineage (HI-E and HI-N) response rate of 20% (4 of 20;
95% CI, 6-44) in patients with anemia and neutropenia.

(HI-E, HI-N, HI-P) response rate of 9% (1 of 11; 95%
CI, 0-41) in patients with trilineage cytopenia. There was
1 cytogenetic complete response in a patient with del 5q.
There was an important trend in effect of prior therapy. A 40% HI-E rate (6 of 15 patients) (95% CI, 16-68)
was observed in patients who had prior lenalidomide, but
were HMA naive, with 5 of 11 (45%) patients achieving
significant RBC transfusion reduction and 3 of 11 (27%)
patients achieving transfusion independence. These 3
ongoing patients are still RBC transfusion independent at
the data cutoff for this manuscript. They have been on ezatiostat treatment for 15, 17, and 18 months, respectively.
A 28% HI-E rate (5 of 18 patients; 95% CI, 10-54)
was observed in patients who were both lenalidomide and
HMA naive, with 4 of 8 (50%) patients achieving clinically significant RBC transfusion reduction. In the 16
patients who had received prior HMA but were lenalidomide naive, a 0% HI-E rate (95% CI, 0-21) was observed.
Prior HMA treatment was associated with a 6-fold
decrease in the odds (odds ratio ¼ 0.16; 95% CI, 0.030.81) for HI-E response to subsequent ezatiostat (P ¼ .027).
A recent study reported poor outcomes for MDS patients

who have failed azacitidine therapy.14 This observation that
prior HMA treatment is associated with less effective
response to subsequent therapies is not unique to ezatiostat.
Comparison of ezatiostat efficacy in patients with
prior HMA treatment versus being HMA naive showed
an HI-E rate of 7% (2 of 27; 95% CI, 1-24) versus 33%
(11 of 33; 95% CI, 18-52) respectively (P ¼ .018). The
transfusion reduction rate was 11% (2 of 19; 95% CI, 133) in patients with prior HMA treatment versus 47%
(9 of 19; 95% CI, 24-71) in patients that were HMA naive (P ¼ .023). The median duration of response in HMA
treatment-naive patients was 46 weeks (range, 2-63) compared with 34 weeks (range, 2-34) in patients with a history of prior HMA treatment. The HI-N response was
observed in 3 of 9 HMA-naive patients (33%; 95% CI,
8-70) compared with 1 in 12 patients (8%; 95% CI,
0-39) who had received prior HMA treatment.
Comparison of ezatiostat efficacy in patients with a
history of prior lenalidomide treatment versus lenalidomide naive state showed an HI-E rate of 31% (8 of 26;
95% CI, 14-52) versus 15% (5 of 34; 95% CI, 5-31),
respectively. Similarly, the clinically significant RBC
transfusion reduction rate was 39% (7 of 18; 95% CI,
17-64) in patients who had received prior lenalidomide
versus 20% (4 of 20; 95% CI, 6-44) in patients who were
lenalidomide naive. Clinically and statistically significant
findings were shown on the transfusion-independent rate
of patients (22%) with prior lenalidomide treatment (4 of
18; 95% CI, 6-48) versus 0% (0%; 95% CI, 0-17) in
patients with no prior lenalidomide therapy (P ¼ .042).

CONCLUSIONS
Ezatiostat, a reversible oral inhibitor of the enzyme GSTP11, in this phase 2 study, showed promising hematopoietic
promoting activity in heavily pretreated patients with low to
intermediate-1 risk MDS. These results confirm the previously reported proof of concept study using intravenous
administration,8 as well as the phase 1 study of the current
oral formulation using an abbreviated dosing schedule.7
The population in this study was heavily prior treated:
77% resistant to erythropoietin, 38% resistant to lenalidomide, and 47% resistant to HMAs. In addition, the majority of these patients (69%) were of an intermediate-1 risk
IPSS group, with 94% being in the non-del 5q subtypes by
the WHO classification. Efficacy results showed a clinically
meaningful and sustained reduction in responding patients’
transfusion requirements including, in some responders, the
achievement of transfusion independence. Among the
transfusion-dependent patients, the HI-E rate was 29%,

2146

with 11% achieving complete transfusion independence.
The overall median duration of HI-E response was 34
weeks, whereas on the 4-week cycle dose schedule the median duration of response was 46 weeks. The trends of longer duration of HI-E response on DS2, better tolerability of
the lower daily dose utilized on DS2, combined with more
convenience for patients of dosing of 2 tablets twice a day,
led to our decision to select DS2 for future ezatiostat studies.
Beneficial effects were also observed in a subset of those
with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, confirming the
multilineage efficacy of ezatiostat. As previously reported,
some patients also achieved cytogenetic responses, including
1 patient with del 5q cytogenetic abnormality.
Currently, the recommended approach for this
group of MDS patients is to start with erythroid stimulating agents for those who are not heavily transfusion dependent and have a low baseline serum erythropoietin
level. Next, lenalidomide is recommended for the del 5q
group, and for the rest, the choice ranges from lenalidomide (although not FDA approved for this indication) to
1 of the hypomethylating drugs (azacitidine or decitabine). All 3 of these drugs, however, are associated with
considerable myelosuppression.
Ezatiostat had a very favorable tolerability profile,
with gastrointestinal side effects being the predominant
adverse event; however, these were mainly restricted to
grades 1 and 2, confirming the results of the prior studies.
Importantly, a significant increase in frequency and severity of adverse events and decrease in efficacy were noted in
patients who had received prior treatment with hypomethylating drugs. The tolerability and efficacy profile
described above supports a dual role for ezatiostat in the
management of low to intermediate-1 risk MDS patients,
as a disease modifier and as a potential cytoprotective
agent. This drug improves hematopoiesis in a subset of
these MDS patients without causing myelosuppression.
Because the safety and efficacy were significantly worse in
patients treated with prior HMAs, ezatiostat would best
be used in HMA-naive patients. Ezatiostat has shown efficacy both in patients who are lenalidomide naive and in
patients who have had prior lenalidomide treatment.
These observations will help guide patient selection in
future trials. We have previously reported on a patient
from this trial who was a del 5q lenalidomide failure
relapsing with a new t(2;3) clonal abnormality who experienced a prolonged trilineage response lasting over a year
after a brief 6-week exposure to ezatiostat.15 This suggests
a potential treatment application for ezatiostat in a group
of del 5q lenalidomide failures in whom the therapeutic

efficacy of HMAs has proved to be limited. Given the absence of myelosuppression, it is reasonable to postulate a
cytoprotective effect of ezatiostat. This profile has provided the basis for a current ongoing phase 1 study testing
the combination of lenalidomide plus ezatiostat in low to
intermediate-1 risk non-del 5q MDS. In this heavily pretreated population, ezatiostat is a very tolerable drug compared with the other disease-modifying agents available.
In addition, ezatiostat was observed to be active in patients
who had failed prior treatment with lenalidomide. This
patient population represents a group with a particular
unmet medical need and is of interest for further study.
In addition to the clinical benefit of reducing transfusion requirments in MDS patients, there is also a potential
for an oral pharmaceutical small-molecule therapy to have a
pharmacoeconomic benefit. A recent study by Frytak et al16
reported that transfusion dependence in adults with MDS
was associated with an incremental cost of $31,255 per
patient per year. This study demonstrated that an important
consequence of transfusion dependence for MDS patients
was markedly greater use of and consequently higher costs
associated with inpatient and outpatient services. They concluded that pharmaceutical therapies may help more
patients achieve transfusion independence, thereby reducing
the financial burden of MDS. The mechanism by which a
reversible inhibitor of the enzyme GSTP1-1 can cause significant improvement in the MDS patient is of great interest
and may shed additional insight into the molecular defects
associated with the development and evolution of MDS.
Recent reports have shown that GSTP1-1 is a significant
mediator of signaling in hematopoietic cells, most likely
through negative regulation of JNK activity. Consequently,
inhibition of GSTP1-1 would be expected to stimulate
growth and differentiation of normal progenitor cells as
well as apoptosis of dysplastic cells.17 Inhibition of GSTP11 may also elevate levels of reactive oxygen species that
would contribute to apoptosis of abnormal cells. In addition, studies are also in progress to identify genomic markers
that predict enhanced response to ezatiostat.
In conclusion, this study supports the further development of ezatiostat in low to intermediate-1 risk MDS.
