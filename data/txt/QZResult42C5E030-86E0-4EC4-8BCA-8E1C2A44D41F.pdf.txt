Abstract:

Better understanding the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process is
essential to developing novel targeted therapeutics. Recently, invadopodia have
been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis.
Invadopodia are basally-localized, actin-rich structures that concentrate protease
activity to areas of the cell in contact with the extracellular matrix. We recently
found that the transcription factor Twist1, a central regulator of the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), promotes invadopodia formation via upregulation
of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression and activity. This
finding, combined with other investigations into the mechanisms of invadopodia
formation, reveal several novel targets for clinical inhibition of invadopodia.
Here, we provide an overview of clinically-relevant targets for intervention in
invadopodia, including Src signaling, PDGFR signaling, and metalloprotease activity.

invasive [5]. This program is accompanied by expression
changes in a host of genes, among which genes associated
with epithelial characteristics (E-cadherin and ZO-1) are
downregulated while others associated with mesenchymal
cells (smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and N-cadherin) are
upregulated. A group of transcription factors, including
Twist1, Snai1, Snai2, Zeb1, and Zeb2, play key roles in
driving EMT during tumor metastasis[6, 7].
Current therapeutic standards for breast cancer
involve surgical resection of the tumor supplemented
with radiation therapy and chemotherapy[8]. Cytotoxic
drugs and hormone-blocking therapeutics are the most
often used chemotherapeutics, generally chosen for their
effects on cell growth and apoptosis. Generation of new
therapeutic agents targeting invasion and metastasis have
the potential to improve survival in populations that do
not respond well to conventional therapies. Despite the
growing evidence linking EMT to metastasis in breast
and other cancers, therapeutically targeting EMT may
be difficult. Directly inhibiting the transcription factors
that drive EMT is currently infeasible, as targeting large
binding interfaces is not amenable to small-molecule
inhibition[9, 10]. Instead, downstream targets of these
transcription factors essential for their role in invasion
and metastasis are more realistic targets of therapeutic

Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer
among women worldwide, with virtually all patients
succumbing to not the primary disease, but distant
metastases[1, 2]. Metastasis, the spread of cancer cells
from the primary tumor to distant organs, is a multistep
process in which cancer cells must invade through
the extracellular matrix (ECM), intravasate into the
bloodstream, survive transport through the circulatory
system, and finally extravasate at distant organs[3]. As
metastatic breast cancer is largely considered an incurable
disease, better understanding the metastatic process and
its regulation has the potential to not only identify new
prognostic markers but also develop targeted therapeutic
regimens.
Recently, aberrant activation of a developmental
program termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) has been recognized as an important driver of the
metastatic process[4].EMT is a conserved developmental
process in which epithelial cells lose E-cadherin-mediated
junctions and apical-basal polarity and become motile and

To better understand the role of invadopodia and
PDGFRα in metastasis, we utilized a subcutaneous
tumor implantation model in which Twist1-expressing
human breast tumor cells carrying shRNAs against
PDGFRα or Tks5 were injected subcutaneously in nude
mice. Knockdown of Tks5, an essential invadopodia
component protein with no other known functions,
allowed us to test whether invadopodia were required for

upregulating

We were therefore interested in the mechanism
by which Twist1 was both necessary and sufficient
for invadopodia formation. None of the structural
or enzymatic proteins found in invadopodia that we
investigated, including Tks5, cortactin,and MT1-MMP,
were transcriptionally regulated by Twist1. We did,
however, observe a significant upregulation of Src kinase
activation upon Twist1 expression. Microarray analysis of
genes upregulated by Twist1 revealed that only one family
of growth factor receptors upstream of Srcactivation
was induced by Twist1: platelet-derived growth factor
receptors (PDGFR) α and β. PDGFRα, in particular, was
immediately and dramatically upregulated. Importantly,
PDGFRα was phosphorylated and activated under normal
culture conditions, implying the existence of an autocrine
loop upon Twist1 activation.
There are two PDGFRs, PDGFRα and β, which differ
primarily in their responsiveness to PDGF ligands[24].
In mammalian systems, PDGFR expression is abundant
in mesenchymal and vascular tissues and is particularly
involved in angiogenesis[25, 26]. Importantly, PDGFRs
are directly upstream of Src kinase activity[27]. Upon
stimulation by their ligands, the receptors dimerize and
can directly activate Src kinase[28]. PDGFR signaling has
previously been implicated as required for metastasis in
a TGF-β-induced EMT model, although the mechanism
for this inhibition was not clearly understood[29].
Encouragingly, a previous study found that PDGFR
activation increased invadopodia formation in vascular
smooth muscle cells[30].
Knockdown or inhibition of PDGFRα with a mouse
monoclonal blocking antibody significantly reduced
Twist1-induced invadopodia formation and function.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter
assays also revealed that PDGFRα was a direct target
of Twist1. Activation of PDGFR signaling by Twist1
therefore appeared to be a direct requirement for Twist1mediated invadopodia formation.

Although the role of EMT in metastasis is gradually
becoming clearer, the exact molecular mechanisms
underlying how EMT induces local invasion and
metastasis are still not well understood[11]. Disruption of
epithelial cell-cell contact is necessary for metastasis, but
it is not sufficient[12]. We therefore sought to determine
what pathways or mechanisms Twist1 induces to drive
active local invasion and metastasis. We did not observe
significant changes in secreted proteolytic activity in cells
overexpressing Twist1, although they gained the ability to
invade through Matrigel and metastasize to the lung in a
subcutaneous tumor model[7]. We therefore hypothesized
that Twist1 induces local invasion and eventual metastasis
by inducing the formation of membrane protrusion
structures called invadopodia.
Invadopodia are actin-rich protrusions that localize
proteolytic activity to areas of the cell in contact with
extracellular matrix(ECM)[13-15]. Invadopodia are
observed in many invasive cancer cell lines [16]. A
wide variety of actin-interacting proteins and scaffolding
proteins are involved in invadopodia formation, including
cortactin, Tks5, fascin, N-WASP, and Arp2/3[17]. In
particular, the actin-bundling protein cortactin and the
adaptor proteins Tks4/5appear to play integral roles in
invadopodia formation[18, 19]. Both metalloproteases
and serine proteases localize to invadopodia, including
both secreted (MMP2 and MMP9) and transmembrane
proteases (MT1-MMP, ADAM12, FAPα, and DPP-iv)
[20]. Src kinase activity and phosphorylation of Tks4 [21],
Tks5[18], and cortactin[19]are absolute requirements for
invadopodia formation. Upregulation of invadopodia
formation by Twist1 would therefore present a novel
mechanism by which Twist1 could induce local invasion
without changing secreted protease activity[22].
In order to investigate whether Twist1 was necessary
for invadopodia, we generated knockdowns of Twist1
in 168FARN and 4T1 cell lines, two mouse mammary
carcinoma cell lines that express high levels of Twist1.
By staining for markers of invadopodia (colocalization
of F-actin with either cortactin or Tks5) we found that
knockdown of Twist1 significantly reduced invadopodia
formation in both 168FARN and 4T1 cells[23].
Importantly, knockdown of Twist1 also dramatically
reduced ECM degradation.Similar analyses in normal
mammary epithelial cells overexpressing Twist1
demonstrated that Twist1 was also sufficient to promote
invadopodia formation and function. Importantly,
Twist1-inducedinvadopodia formation requires both
metalloprotease and Src-kinase activities, consistent with
their known roles in invadopodia.

Twist1-mediated metastasis. Knockdown of PDGFRα
was used to determine whether PDGF signaling induced
by Twist1 for invadopodia formation was required for
metastasis. Although no significant differences in growth
rate were observed, both Tks5 and PDGFRα knockdowns
dramatically suppressed local invasion, with the primary
tumors remaining relatively well-encapsulated in a layer
of fibrotic tissue. In contrast, tumors expressing control
knockdown constructs invaded through the local ECM,
often as single cells. Furthermore, knockdown of both
Tks5 and PDGFRα significantly reduced dissemination to
the lungs, as measured by quantification of GFP-positive
puncta in the lungs.
In microarray data sets of human breast cancer tumor
samples, we found a strong correlation between Twist1
and PDGFRα expression, with PDGFRα consistently
ranking within the top 1% of genes correlated with
Twist1. Furthermore, in a Stage II breast cancer tissue
array from the National Cancer Institute coexpression of
Twist1 and PDGFRα was significantly associated with
patient survival, indicating the importance of this pathway
in human breast tumor progression.
Druggable targets regulating invadopodia formation
and function
The connection between Twist1, PDGFR signaling,
and invadopodia is exciting as it highlights several
new therapeutic targets for targeting local invasion in
the metastatic process. Namely, PDGFRα, Src, and
metalloproteases localized in invadopodia are appealing,
druggable targets for targeting invasion in breast cancer
metastasis (see Figure). As metastasis may occur

via invadopodia-independent mechanisms in patient
populations, Twist1 and PDGFRα coexpression may be
appealing markers for patient stratification for treatment
regimens targeting invadopodia.

PDGFRα and EGFR
As a direct target of Twist1 tightly associated with
survival in human breast cancer patient tissue samples,
PDGFRα is an especially appealing target for therapeutic
intervention in breast cancer metastasis. The most wellknown and studied PDGFR inhibitor is imatinib mesylate
(Gleevec, Novartis), which also inhibits Abl and c-Kit
tyrosine kinases[31]. Data from clinical trials involving
use of imatinib in advanced breast cancers has been
discouraging with no clear objective responses[32].
If PDGFR signaling is important for invasion and
metastasis, however, improved survival in these patients
with late stage disease would be unlikely as the cancer had
already widely metastasized. Often severe gastrointestinal
side effects of imatinib treatment also severely limited its
utility in at least one trial[33]. Another tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, Sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer), targets PDGFRs,
VEGFs, Kit, RET, and CSF[33]. Encouragingly, Sunitinib
is much better tolerated and has had some effectiveness in
preliminary clinical trials of metastatic breast cancer[34].
The promiscuous inhibitory profile of Sunitinib makes
it difficult to determine whether its effects on disease
outcome are through inhibition of PDGFRs. In light of our
discovery, it is important to examine patient tumor samples
to determine whether Sunitinib suppresses invadopodia

Recent research in our lab revealed that Twist1 directly induces transcription of PDGFRα. Upregulation of PDGFRα
leads to an increase in Src kinase activity that induces the formation or stabilization of invadopodia by phosphorylation of invadopodia
component proteins by Src kinase. Invadopodia formation involves discrete steps in which formation of the F-actin core is an early
event, followed by recruitment and phosphorylation of invadopodia component proteins like cortactin and Tks5 before proteases are
recruited to the mature invadopodia. Promising targets for chemical inhibition include [1] PDGFR signaling, [2] Src kinase activity, and [3]
metalloprotease activity at invadopodia (including MMP2, MMP9, and MT1-MMP).

and local invasion. To truly understand the utility of these
novel inhibitors in breast cancer, it will be necessary to
identify patient populations that will respond best to the
therapy. Development of more specific inhibitors that
target only PDGFRs, including humanized monoclonal
antibodies, may address some of the side effects due to
off targeting.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling
is also known to play an important role in regulation of
invadopodia formation. The most characterized role of
EGFR signaling in invadopodia is its function upstream
of Src activation[35]. HER-2 (human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2) status is an important clinical marker for
treatment, with about 30% of patients presenting increased
levels of HER-2expression[33]. Patients that are HER-2
positive are considered candidates for treatment with HER2 inhibitors, including trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech)
and lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb GSK)[36]. Recently, new
small molecule-based therapeutics targeting EGFR,
including erlotinib (Tarceva, OSI Pharmaceuticals), have
proven useful in other cancers with upregulation of EGFR
signaling[37]. OSI Pharmaceuticals investigated the
properties of cancer cells resistant to EGFR inhibition and
found that this subpopulation of cells displayed properties
of EMT, including an increased dependence on PDGFR
signaling[38, 39]. During EMT, PDGFR signaling may
largely supplant or supplement the role of EGFR signaling
in promoting invadopodia formation in breast cancer cells.
This also suggests that the EMT process may play roles
in not only mediating local invasion and metastasis, but
also providing an escape mechanism from growth factor
inhibition.

single-agent trials resulting in no significant differences
in survival or progression[43]. Combination therapeutics
have resulted in more positive, although modest, effects
[42].It is important to note, however, that all clinical
trials regarding Src inhibitors in breast cancer have been
conducted in unselected patient populations and the main
readout for effectiveness has been tumor size and growth,
not invasion. There are some indications, however, that
patient stratification can predict responsiveness to Src
kinase inhibition[44]. Novel Src inhibitors targeting the
peptide binding site of Src rather than the ATP-binding site
(KX2-391, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals) may also prove
to be more effective in solid tumors, although clinical
trials involving these compounds are still preliminary and
underway[45].
Interestingly, a recent publication elucidated a
detailed mechanisms for Src-kinase induced invadopodia
formation[35]. Rather than directly phosphorylating
cortactin, Src instead activates the Abl-related nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Arg that is responsible for
cortactin phosphorylation. In this system, cortactin
tyrosine phosphorylation is transiently required for
cortactin-mediated actin polymerization in invadopodia.
This is particularly interesting, as Gleevec, a drug
often used to target PDGFR signaling, also inhibits Arg
activity[31]. The promiscuity of Gleevec could therefore
target multiple levels of the signaling pathways regulating
invadopodia formation, making it a promising target in
selected patient populations[46].

Src and its effectors

Several metalloproteases are enriched at invadopodia,
including MMP2, MMP9, and MT1-MMP[47]. The
transmembrane metalloprotease MT1-MMP is essential
for invadopodia proteolytic activity: knockdown of MT1MMP in multiple cell lines almost completely eliminates
associated matrix degradation[19, 48]. In addition,
recent work has also elucidated the vital role of MTMMPs in mediating invasion through three-dimensional
matrices[49].The central role of MT-MMPs in mediating
extracellular proteolysis at invadopodia could be due to
either its intrinsic collagenase/gelatinase activity or via
activation of soluble MMPs by MT1-MMP[50]. There is
also evidence that hydroxymate metalloprotease inhibitors
prevent not only ECM proteolysis, but also invadopodia
formation through an unknown mechanism[19].
As cancer cells must invade through both
basement membranes and the ECM during metastasis,
metalloproteases were quickly recognized as appealing
targets to inhibit metastasis. Although results were
promising in preclinical models, metalloprotease inhibitors
have universally failed in clinical trials[51]. Once again,
clinical trials with metalloprotease inhibitors to date have
invariably used unselected patient populations, often with
late-stage disease. Additionally, early metalloprotease

Metalloproteases

As the first proto-oncogene discovered, there is a
large body of research focusing on not only the role of
Src in cancer but also potential therapeutic interventions.
It is generally recognized that Src plays multiple roles in
carcinomas, promoting both proliferation and survival and
driving invasion[40]. The essential role of Src activation in
invadopodia formation suggests that Src inhibitors should
effectively prevent invadopodia formation and ECM
degradation in tumors. Several Src inhibitors are already in
the clinic and used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia
by virtue of their ability to also inhibit Abl kinase[41].
Src activity is also upregulated in a wide variety of solid
cancers, including colon, breast, gastric, and ovarian
cancers[42]. Several pharmaceutical companies have
therefore developed Src kinase inhibitors with varying
levels of success. Most Src inhibitors that have progressed
to clinical trials in solid tumors (Dasatinib, BristolMeyers Squibb; Saracatinib, AstraZeneca; and Bosutinib,
Wyeth) work by competitively binding the ATP-binding
site of Src[40]. Initial results from clinical trials of Src
inhibitors in breast cancer have been mixed, with most

inhibitors were broad-spectrum inhibitors of multiple
metalloproteases and often had acute toxicities that
severely limited therapeutic doses[51]. MMPs may also
play anti-tumor functions in many tumors, as well. For
example, MMP8-/- mice developed more papillomas
upon carcinogen treatment[52].In recent years, there has
been a reemergence of interest in more targeted inhibition
of metalloproteases. In particular, the fully human
monoclonal antibody DX-2400 (Dyax Corp.) that targets
MT1-MMP, has shown great promise in preclinical models
in inhibiting invasiveness of cancer cell lines[53]. In
addition, a novel class of metalloprotease inhibitors, triplehelical transition state analogues, specifically targets the
gelatinase and collagenase activities of metalloproteases
(specifically MMP2 and 9)[54]. Clinically addressing the
role of metalloproteases in breast cancer metastasis will
involve not only designing trials to maximize the impact
of the therapeutics, but also finding novel inhibitors with
greater specificity and fewer negative side-effects.

Conclusions
In order to directly target metastasis, essential
regulators of the metastatic process must be identified. In
addition, these targets should ideally be kinases or proteases
with moieties amenable to chemical inhibition. Although
EMT is beginning to be recognized as a key player in
breast cancer, promising targets of inhibition regulating
this process have been lacking. Our identification of
PDGFRα and invadopodia as essential mediators of EMTinduced metastasis opens the door for clinical intervention
of pathways regulating invadopodia function. These
pathways include Src kinase, PDGFRα, and invadopodiaspecific proteases. In order to test the hypothesis that
inhibiting such pathways is effective, clinical trials most
likely benefit from careful selection of patient populations
based on our knowledge of invadopodia regulation.
In addition, for both PDGFRα and metalloproteases,
generation of more selective compounds may be necessary
to realize positive clinical outcomes. Our study suggests
that Twist1 and PDGFRα are effective predictors, not only
of patient survival, but also for patient selection in clinical
trials targeting invadopodia formation and function.
