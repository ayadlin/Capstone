Abstract
Multitarget antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been shown to reduce regulatory T cells (Treg)
in tumor-bearing animals and patients with metastatic renal carcinomas. However, a direct role of the VEGF-A/
VEGFR pathway inhibition in this phenomenon is a matter of debate and molecular mechanisms leading to Treg
modulation in this setting have not been explored to date. Treg proportion, number, and proliferation were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry in peripheral blood of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with
bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting speciﬁcally VEGF-A, and in colon cancer–bearing mice (CT26)
treated with drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR axis. The direct impact of VEGF-A on Treg induction was assessed
together with speciﬁc blockade of different isoforms of VEGFRs that may be involved. In CT26-bearing mice, antiVEGF antibody and sunitinib treatments reduced Treg but masitinib, a TKI not targeting VEGFR, did not.
Targeting VEGF-A/VEGFR axis seems sufﬁcient to affect Treg percentages, without any changes in their function.
Similarly, bevacizumab inhibited Treg accumulation in peripheral blood of patients with mCRCs. In vitro, Treg
expressing VEGFR from tumor-bearing mice directly proliferated in response to VEGF-A. Anti-VEGF-A treatment
decreased Treg proliferation in mice as well as in patients with mCRCs. VEGFR-2- but not VEGFR-1–speciﬁc
blockade led to the same results. We identiﬁed a novel mechanism of tumor escape by which VEGF-A directly
triggers Treg proliferation. This proliferation is inhibited by VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 blockade. Anti-VEGF-A therapies
also have immunologic effects that may be used with a therapeutic goal in the future. Cancer Res; 73(2); 539–49.

Introduction
More than 1 million new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) are
diagnosed each year worldwide. Disease-speciﬁc mortality has
decreased signiﬁcantly in the past 2 decades with the introduction of new chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin
and irinotecan, and, more recently, targeted therapies such as
bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody (1).
The immune system seems to play a role in both the
occurrence and the progression of CRCs. Elevated numbers
of intratumoral cytotoxic and memory T cells (CD8þ and
CD45ROþ, respectively) have been shown to correlate with

an aggressive phenotype reﬂected by tumor microinvasive
status (2). This inﬁltration may also be a major predictor of
tumor recurrence and patient survival (3). The association
between CD45ROþ cell inﬁltration and overall survival has
been conﬁrmed in stage I to IV CRCs (4). Tumors can subvert
the immune system, however, notably by inducing immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg).
Tregs, characterized by CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 expression,
inhibit the development of an effective immune response
especially against cancer or infectious agents (5). In healthy
individuals, they are able to prevent autoimmune disease. In
patients with cancer, Tregs expand in peripheral blood and
tumor tissue. Strong Treg inﬁltration of tumors is generally
associated with poor clinical outcome (5). Elevated blood
and tumor Treg numbers have also been described in CRCs.
Although the prognostic impact of Treg in CRCs is still a
matter of debate, elevated peritumoral numbers of Foxp3þ
Treg cells are associated with advanced-stage tumors and
poorer overall survival (6). In murine models of CRCs,
systemic removal of Tregs using anti-CD25 antibody results
in tumor rejection and in improved vaccine-induced antitumor T-cell responses (7). In addition, Treg depletion from
peripheral blood of patients with CRCs unmasks CD4þ and
CD8þ T-cell responses against tumor-associated antigens in
vitro (8, 9). These observations suggest that Tregs could
hamper the development of an effective antitumor immune
response and that Treg modulation in patients with CRCs

might boost antitumor immunity or the response to
immunotherapy.
Recently, sunitinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) that selectively blocks VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3
(VEGFR-1, -2, -3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors a
and b (PDGFRa and b), stem cell factor receptor (c-kit), and
Flt3, has been shown to reduce Treg numbers in tumor-bearing
mice and in patients with metastatic renal carcinoma (10–13).
However, it is unclear whether (i) these observations are
limited to patients with renal cancer and (ii) the effects of
this multitarget molecule on Tregs result directly from VEGFA/VEGFR axis inhibition or through another signaling mechanism. If an indirect action through VEGF-induced immature
dendritic cells (DC) has been suggested (14, 15), the direct
effect of VEGF-A on Treg has never been studied. Moreover,
data on anti-VEGF-A therapy and Treg in patients with cancer
are scarce and discordant (16, 17). Because bevacizumab has
been approved for ﬁrst- and second-line treatment of metastatic CRCs (mCRC; ref. 18), we analyzed the impact of speciﬁc
VEGF-A/VEGFR blockade on Treg in a mouse model of CRCs
and in patients with mCRCs and the potential direct effect of
VEGF-A on tumor-induced Tregs.

Materials and Methods
Mice, tumors, and treatment
Six- to 8-week-old female Balb/c mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories and kept in speciﬁc-pathogen-free conditions at the INSERM U970 animal facility.
Experiments respected institutional guidelines and were
approved by the Maisons-Alfort Veterinary School ethics
committee. CT26, an N-nitroso-N-methylurethane–induced
undifferentiated colon carcinoma cell line, was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. CT26 cells (2 
105) were injected subcutaneously at day 0 in the right ﬂank
of Balb/c mice. Absence of mycoplasma was checked every 2
months, and cells were authenticated by their ability to
grow in immunocompetent mice as described in the literature. Tumor growth was monitored twice a week using a
caliper. Treatments were started when the tumors reached
9 to 10 mm2. Sunitinib (SU11248, Sutent) and masitinib (4(4-methylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin3ylthiazol-2-ylamino) phenyllbenzamide-mesylate methane
sulfonic acid salt) were given by oral gavage at 40 mg/kg
daily and 30 mg/kg twice a day, respectively. Sunitinib and
masitinib were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
diluted in PBS before administration. Control mice received
DMSO diluted in PBS. In this study, masitinib was used as a
negative control to probe the VEGFR inhibition of sunitinib.
Masitinib is a highly selective TKI that targets a limited
number of key kinases involved in various cancers and
inﬂammatory diseases, including c-kit, PDGFR, and Lyn but
not VEGFR (19). Masitinib is currently the most selective
TKI in clinical development or already approved to date
(20, 21). An anti-mouse VEGF-A antibody (B20-4.1.1) was
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 5 mg/kg twice a week.
Anti-mouse VEGFR-1 (MF1) or anti-mouse VEGFR-2
(DC101) antibodies (800 mg per mouse) were injected i.p.
3 times a week. Control mice received mouse serum. Suni-

tinib was kindly provided by Pﬁzer and anti-mouse VEGF
antibody by Genentech (22), Masitinib by AB Science SA and
anti-VEGFR-1 and anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies by ImClone.
Patients
Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with mCRCs
receiving ﬁrst-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone according to the referent physician's choice
in the Gastroenterology Division of Georges Pompidou European Hospital (Paris, France) between March 2011 and March
2012. Blood was collected before the ﬁrst treatment cycle (D0)
and after the second cycle of treatment (D28). The study was
approved by the local ethics committee, and all the patients
gave their written informed consent before blood sampling.
Patients exhibiting lymphopenia before the ﬁrst cycle of treatment has been excluded. Clinical response has been evaluated
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST v1.1).
Flow cytometry
Cell surface staining of murine splenocytes and tumorinﬁltrating cells used anti-mouse CD4 (RM4-5; Biolegend),
anti-mouse CD25 (PC61; eBioscience), anti-mouse VEGFR-2
(89B3A5; Biolegend), and anti-mouse VEGFR-1 (141522; R&D
Systems). For human studies, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized peripheral
blood on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients, as previously described
(12). PBMCs from patients with mCRCs were stained with
anti-human CD4 (OKT4; Biolegend), anti-human CD25
(BC96; eBioscience), and anti-human CD127 (eBioRDR5;
eBioscience). Intracellular stainings for Foxp3 (using antimouse and anti-human Foxp3; FJK-16 and PHC101, respectively; eBioscience) or Ki67 (B56; BD Biosciences) were
conducted after ﬁxation and permeabilization with the
reagents of the Foxp3 staining set (eBioscience). Isotype
controls were run in parallel. Dead cells were excluded by
using the Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Kit (Invitrogen).
Treg proportion was assessed for all patients, but Ki67
staining was conducted only on patients included after
October 2011. Stained cells were analyzed with a LSRII
cytoﬂuorometer and FACS Diva (Becton Dickinson) and
Flow-Jo Software (TreeStar).
Bromodeoxyuridine labeling
After the ﬁrst anti-VEGF injection, mice received 1 mg of
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) solution twice a day for 2 days.
Two hours after the last BrdUrd injection, the mice were killed
and the spleens removed. BrdUrd was detected by ﬂow cytometry as previously described (23).
Analysis of Treg function
After 2 weeks of treatment with sunitinib or anti-VEGF,
mice were killed and their spleens removed. Tregs were
puriﬁed with the Regulatory T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi
Biotec). Purity of CD4þ/CD25þ (Treg) and CD4þ/CD25
(Tconv) cells was typically above 95%. CD4þCD25þ T-cell
suppressive function was studied as previously described
(24). Brieﬂy, 5  104 Tconvs were cultured with 1  105

irradiated CD4þ-depleted splenocytes in the presence
of anti-CD3 (145-2C11, 1 mg/mL). Tregs were added at
different Treg/Tconv ratios (1:1, 1:5, 1:25). One mCi of 3Hthymidine was added for the last 18 hours. 3H-thymidine
incorporation was analyzed using a b-scintillation counter
(Perkin-Elmer).
VEGF-induced proliferation
Splenocytes from CT26 tumor–bearing mice were used.
Tregs were isolated by using the Regulatory T cell Isolation
Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) or cell sorting of CD4þCD25þ cells
after CD4 enrichment (CD4þ T cell isolation kit II, Miltenyi
Biotec). Purity after cell sorting was around 99%. Puriﬁed Tregs
(5  104) were cultured in the presence of plate-bound antiCD3 (10 mg/mL) and interleukin (IL)-2 (100 U/mL) for 4 days.
Murine VEGF (Miltenyi Biotec) was added at 50 ng/mL. Treg
proliferation was assessed by measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation during the last 18 hours of culture.
VEGF assay
VEGF serum concentrations in CT26 tumor–bearing mice
and tumor-free mice were evaluated with an ELISA method
(mouse VEGF DuoSet, R&D Systems). In humans, VEGF levels
have been determined in plasma using an ELISA method
(Human VEGF Quantikine Elisa kit, R&D systems).
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as means  SEM or ranges, as appropriate. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compare 2 groups.
The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare 3 or more
groups. The Wilcoxon-matched pairs test was used to analyze
the effects of treatment between D0 and D28 in patients with
mCRCs. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined with Prism
software (GraphPad Software, Inc). Signiﬁcance was assumed
at P < 0.05.

Results
VEGF-A/VEGFR pathway blockade is sufﬁcient to inhibit
Treg accumulation
We took advantage of a murine model of colorectal
carcinoma to analyze the impact of speciﬁc VEGF-A/VEGFR
blockade on modulation of Treg accumulation. CT26 tumor–
bearing mice were treated with anti-VEGF-A antibody or
different TKIs targeting or not VEGFR. In CT26 tumor–
bearing mice, the percentage of Treg (CD25þ/Foxp3þ)
among CD4þ T cells was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the spleen
(Fig. 1A and C) and tumor-draining lymph nodes (not
shown). Treatment of CT26 tumor–bearing mice with DMSO
or mouse serum did not modulate Treg percentages and
numbers as compared with nontreated CT26 tumor–bearing
mice (not shown). After 2 weeks of treatment, anti-VEGF-A
treatment reduced the percentage and absolute number of
Tregs in the spleen to physiologic levels (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S3A) and in tumor-draining lymph nodes
(not shown). Anti-VEGF-A also decreased Treg percentage
(not shown) and number in the tumor (2,267  614 Treg/
mm2 with mouse serum; 463  88 Treg/mm2 with antiVEGF; Fig. 1B). This decrease was observed as early as 1

www.aacrjournals.org

week after the beginning of the treatment but reached the
statistical signiﬁcance after 2 weeks and was maintained
after 3 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S1). Sunitinib, a TKI
targeting VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR, c-kit, and Flt3, resulted
in a similar decrease in Treg proportion and numbers in
the spleen (Fig. 1C and not shown) and tumor (2,262  462
Treg/mm2 with DMSO, 857  173 Treg/mm2 with
sunitinib; Fig. 1D and not shown). Sunitinib and anti-VEGF
induced strong antitumor effects in CT26 model (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B), but Treg modulation is not caused by the
reduction of tumor size as no or only weak correlation between
Treg percentage in spleens (Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D)
or tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2E and S2F) and tumor size
has been observed. Interestingly, sunitinib or anti-VEGFA did
not decrease the absolute number of other cell populations
including CD4þ T cells, CD4þ Foxp3 T cells, or CD8þ T cells in
spleens (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3E) or tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D). Thus, both anti-VEGF-A and sunitinib
inhibited Treg accumulation in tumor-bearing mice without
depleting other T-cell subsets.
To conﬁrm that VEGF-A/VEGFR pathway inhibition impeded Treg accumulation in tumor-bearing mice, we used masitinib as a negative control, as it is a TKI close to sunitinib that
targets c-kit, PDGFR, Fak-kinases but not VEGFR (19). Contrary to sunitinib and anti-VEGF-A, masitinib did not reduce
Treg proportion or numbers in the spleen (Fig. 1E) or tumor
(Fig. 1F).
Thus, speciﬁc VEGF-A/VEGFR(-1,-2) inhibition was sufﬁcient to prevent tumor-induced Treg accumulation in animals
spleens and tumors.
Bevacizumab reduces Treg proportion in peripheral
blood of mCRC patients
To conﬁrm that these observations were also relevant in
human, we ﬁrst quantiﬁed Tregs in peripheral blood of
patients with mCRCs. As previously described (6), Treg
percentages were higher in patients with mCRCs than in
healthy volunteers (HV; Fig. 2A). This difference could not be
related to age difference between healthy volunteers and
patients with mCRCs (51.05  13 and 66.7  11.5 years old,
respectively) as we and others have not observed an agerelated effect on Treg proportion (ref. 6 and not shown).
After 2 cycles of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy, blood
Treg percentage was signiﬁcantly reduced (day 0: 5.94  0.5
vs. day 28: 4.14  0.41, P ¼ 0.0039). As the standard ﬁrst-line
treatment for mCRC is chemotherapy, with or without
bevacizumab, we were unable to study patients treated with
bevacizumab alone. We thus studied patients treated with
chemotherapy alone as controls. It is of note that no major
differences between patients treated with chemotherapy
associated with bevacizumab or chemotherapy alone have
been observed (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly,
patients treated with 2 cycles of chemotherapy alone showed
no signiﬁcant decrease in their peripheral blood Treg percentages (day 0: 6.4  1.09 vs. day 28: 5.85  0.97, P ¼ 0.19),
suggesting that the decrease observed in patients treated
with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was due to bevacizumab (Fig. 2B and C). Chemotherapy alone or associated with

bevacizumab did not result in lymphopenia (Supplementary

CD8þ T-cell subsets (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C).

Thus, these data suggest that in patients with mCRCs,
neutralization of VEGF-A could also induce a decrease in Treg
proportion.

Treg proportion is enhanced in peripheral blood of patients with mCRCs compared with healthy volunteers. The Treg proportion (CD25 Foxp3 CD127 cells

monitored in peripheral blood of patients with mCRCs before (day 0) and after 2 cycles of treatment (day 28) with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (n ¼ 9) or

VEGF-A/VEGFR blockade does not affect suppressive
function of Treg
We next determined whether blocking VEGF-A/VEGFR
pathway using anti-VEGF-A or a TKI targeting VEGFR such
as sunitinib modulated Treg function. Puriﬁed Tregs from the
spleens of CT26 tumor–bearing mice treated with sunitinib,
anti-VEGF-A mAb, or vehicle were cocultured at different
ratios with conventional CD4þ CD25 T cells stimulated
by irradiated CD4þ-depleted splenocytes and anti-CD3 as
previously described (24). Proliferation was assessed in terms
of 3H-thymidine incorporation. Tregs from both sunitinib- and
anti-VEGF-A–treated mice maintained their capacity to
inhibit conventional T-cell proliferation (Fig. 3A) and IFN-g
secretion (stimulated Tconv: 1,744  30 pg/mL; stimulated T
conv þ Treg: 425  99 pg/mL; stimulated Tconv þ Treg
sunitinib: 357  89 pg/mL; stimulated Tconv þ Treg antiVEGF-A Ab: 121  100 pg/mL; Fig. 3B). Likewise, conventional
CD4þ Foxp3 T cells are not decreased by sunitinib or antiVEGF treatments (Supplementary Figs. S3D and S4C). Susceptibility of conventional T cells to Treg suppression was unaffected by these treatments (data not shown). Thus, VEGF-A/
VEGF-R(-1,-2) pathway blockade by anti-VEGF-A or sunitinib
depleted Tregs in the spleen and tumor but did not modulate
their function.
VEGF-A directly induces Treg proliferation in tumorbearing mice
Treg accumulation in tumor-bearing mice could occur
through different mechanisms, such as expansion of preexisting Tregs, conversion of conventional na€ve or memory CD4þ T
cells into Tregs, and migration or preferential survival of
Tregs (25). Although VEGF-A can induce Treg differentiation
by generating immature DCs (14, 15, 26), it is also an antiapoptotic and a proliferation factor for several cell subtypes,
including endothelial cells and tumor cells (27). Whether

www.aacrjournals.org

VEGF-A secreted by tumor cells can directly act on Treg is
unclear. In vitro, CT26 cells were able to secrete high levels of
VEGF-A (332.5 pg/mL  10.4 per 2.104 cells after 72 hours). To
examine the effect of VEGF-A on Treg in tumor-bearing mice,
we ﬁrst measured blood VEGF-A levels in tumor-bearing mice
and healthy controls. Serum VEGF-A levels were indeed
enhanced in CT26 tumor–bearing mice (Fig. 4A). Proliferation
of splenic Treg (measured using the cell-cycle marker Ki67) but
not conventional T cells was enhanced in CT26-bearing mice as
compared with healthy controls (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. S6A). Anti-VEGF-A treatment of tumor-bearing animals
reduced the percentage of Ki67þ (proliferating) Tregs as compared with animals receiving mouse serum (Fig. 4C). This was
conﬁrmed by the injection of BrdUrd, a nucleoside analogue
that is selectively incorporated by dividing cells. This decrease
is observed as early as day 7 after the beginning of the treatment
but reached signiﬁcance after 2 weeks (not shown). After only
one injection of anti-VEGF-A, the proportion of BrdUrdþ Tregs
was signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 4D). Similar results were
observed with sunitinib (data not shown). Interestingly, antiVEGFA has no effect on proliferation of conventional T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). As previously described (28), only
CD44hi memory Treg proliferated in tumor-bearing animals.
Proliferation of this Treg subset is decreased after anti-VEGF-A
treatment (Fig. 4E). Thus, VEGF-A appeared to induce Treg
proliferation in tumor-bearing mice.
We then tested the capacity of VEGF-A to directly induce
Treg proliferation. Treg proliferation, assessed by measuring
3
H-thymidine incorporation, was induced when anti-CD3 was
combined with IL-2, but not with anti-CD3 alone, as previously
reported (29). Interestingly, Treg proliferation was further
enhanced when VEGF-A was added (Fig. 4F), suggesting that
VEGF-A can directly enhance mitogenic-induced Treg proliferation. In vitro studies showed that VEGF-A did not improve
Treg survival (data not shown).

Bevacizumab reduces Treg proliferative status in
peripheral blood of mCRC patients
Then, we tried to conﬁrm results observed in the CT26 mouse
model in patients with mCRCs. We ﬁrst showed that plasma
VEGF level in patients with mCRCs was enhanced compared
with healthy volunteers (Fig. 6A). Then, we found that in patients
with mCRC, the proportion of cycling Tregs but not conventional T cells was signiﬁcantly enhanced as compared with
healthy volunteers (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S6B). After
2 cycles of treatment, the percentage of Ki67þ Treg in peripheral
blood seems to be reduced in patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (Fig. 6C) but not in patients treated with
chemotherapy alone (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, bevacizumab associated with chemotherapy has no impact on proliferation of
conventional T cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
Thus, these results suggest that in patients with mCRCs,
neutralization of VEGF-A might decrease Treg proliferation in
peripheral blood.
Altogether, these results suggest that speciﬁc VEGF-A/
VEGFR-2 inhibition could prevent VEGF-A–induced Treg proliferation resulting in a Treg decrease in a mouse model of
CRCs and in patients with mCRCs.

Discussion

Figure 3. Treg function is not modulated by anti-VEGF-A or sunitinib
treatment. A and B, same experimental setting as in Fig. 1. Tregs puriﬁed
þ

from splenocytes were cultured with conventional CD4 CD25 T cells as
described in Materials and Methods. A, proliferation was assessed by
measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation. In controls, Tregs from
tumor-bearing mice ¼ 93 cpm, Tregs from tumor-bearing mice treated
with sunitinib ¼ 112 cpm, Tregs from tumor-bearing mice treated with
anti-VEGF ¼ 65 cpm. B, IFN-g production was analyzed in the culture
supernatant.

Altogether, these results suggest that Treg proliferation
observed in tumor-bearing mice may be induced, at least in
part, by a direct action of VEGF-A, whereas VEGF-A inhibition
blocks this Treg proliferation.
Treg proliferation is dependent on VEGFR-2 expression
by Treg
In healthy mice, only a small proportion of Tregs expressed
VEGFR-1 or -2, whereas expression of both VEGFR-1 and -2 was
enhanced in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 5A). To determine
whether tumor-induced Treg proliferation was dependent on
VEGFR-1 and/or -2, we administered anti-VEGFR-1 or -2 antibodies for 2 weeks to mice with tumors. Anti-VEGFR-2 but not
anti-VEGFR-1 treatment decreased Treg proportion in spleen
(Fig. 5B). Furthermore, anti-VEGFR-1 treatment had no effect
on Treg proliferation assessed by Ki67 expression (Fig. 5C, left),
whereas anti-VEGFR-2 treatment inhibited it (Fig. 5C, right).
Thus, VEGFR-2, but not VEGFR-1, appears to be involved in
VEGF-A–induced Treg expansion in this mouse model of
CRCs.

Antiangiogenic molecules, especially those targeting VEGFA signaling, have recently been shown to modulate Tregs. In
physiologic conditions in na€ve mice, sunitinib has been
reported to decrease Treg percentages (30) but this was not
conﬁrmed by other groups (10). We found that sunitinib and
anti-VEGF-A treatment did not reduce Treg percentages in
na€ve mice (data not shown). In contrast, sunitinib and sorafenib, another TKI targeting the VEGFR family, have been
shown to reduce Treg frequency in tumor-bearing animals and
patients with metastatic renal cancer (10–13, 31–34). However,
these TKIs have multiple targets such as c-Kit and PDGFR that
can have a direct impact on immune cells such as DC, natural
killer (NK), and others (35, 36). The speciﬁc role of targeting the
VEGF/VEGFR pathway has thus not been clearly shown with
these works. More recently, 2 studies suggested an impact of a
speciﬁc VEGF/VEGFR blockade on Tregs. First, anti-VEGF-A
treatment has been suggested in a single immunoﬂuorescence
study of a mouse model of breast cancer to decrease tumor
inﬁltrating Tregs (37). Second, administration of an adenoviral
vector expressing soluble VEGFR-1/-2 has also been described
to reduce tumor Treg proportion in a mouse model of CRCs
(38). However, these data are both preliminary and scarce and
as soluble VEGFR-1/-2 could also block VEGF-B and placenta
growth factor (PlGF), it is difﬁcult to conclude about the
speciﬁc role of VEGF-A blockade on Treg. Here, in a mouse
model of CRC, we show that sunitinib and anti-VEGF-A reduce
the proportion and number of Tregs in tumor and spleen
without reducing other T-cell subset numbers. However, masitinib, a TKI that does not target the VEGF-A/VEGFR axis, but
targets c-Kit and PDGFR did not deplete Treg in our model.
Similar results to those obtained in our mouse colorectal
tumor model were obtained in patients with mCRCs. Indeed,
high circulating levels of VEGF-A were observed, the Treg
proportion was enhanced in the peripheral blood of patients

with CRCs, and treatment with bevacizumab reduced it. In a
preliminary study, Treg decrease seems to correlate with tumor
response to chemotherapy associated with bevacizumab
according to RECIST. Tregs might be a useful predictive tool
on the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy associated with bevacizumab.
However, these results should be conﬁrmed in a larger series of
patients.
Altogether, these observations suggest that AA molecules
modulate a tumor-related phenomenon and that speciﬁc
blockade of the VEGF-A/VEGFR axis by an anti-VEGF mAb
is sufﬁcient to inhibit Treg accumulation in mouse spleen and
tumor in our CRC model and in peripheral blood of patients
with mCRCs.
Tumor-induced Treg expansion is classically explained by 4
possible mechanisms. The ﬁrst is a preferential Treg recruitment
to the tumor: Tregs express receptors for chemokine such as

www.aacrjournals.org

CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, and CCR10 that could induce their migration toward the tumor (25, 39, 40). Second, na€ve and memory
conventional T cells can convert into Tregs with the help of
immature antigen-presenting cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC; refs. 25, 26, 41). Third, naturally occurring Tregs
are more resistant to oxidative stress than conventional T cells,
possibly contributing to their survival in stressful tumor environments (42). Finally, Tregs themselves can proliferate. In
physiologic settings, Tregs proliferate more strongly than na€ve
CD4þ T cells (43). We found that 9.7%  0.7% of Tregs in spleens
of tumor-free mice (Fig. 4B) and 13.59%  1.5% of Tregs from
peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (Fig. 6B) expressed the
cycling marker Ki67. This physiologic proliferation can be
enhanced in various circumstances, including cancer (28). In
mouse models of mammary tumors and melanoma, Treg proliferation is higher in draining lymph nodes at the time of tumor

emergence than in healthy controls (28). We conﬁrm these data
in our colorectal tumor model. Treg proliferation was enhanced
in the spleen, both at the time of tumor emergence and also
when the tumors were established (>100 mm2; Fig. 3B). In
human, 2 studies have shown an increased proportion of
dividing Tregs in tumors or peripheral blood in patients with
breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (44, 45). We found
here that the proportion of Ki67-expressing Tregs was enhanced
in peripheral blood of metastatic patients with CRCs as compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 6B).
As CT26 tumor cells produce VEGF-A (Fig. 3A) and AA
molecules targeting VEGF-A inhibit tumor-induced Treg accumulation, we postulated that VEGF-A could be partly responsible for tumor-induced Treg accumulation. VEGF-A acts as a
proliferative factor for endothelial and some cancer cells (27).
We found that anti-VEGF-A treatment reduced Treg cycling, as
assessed by Ki67 expression and BrdUrd incorporation, and that
VEGF-A directly enhanced the proliferation of Tregs derived
from tumor-bearing mice. To our knowledge, VEGF-A has not
previously been described as a proliferative factor for Tregs.
Immature myeloid cells that expand during tumor progression, such as TGFb-expressing DCs and MDSCs, are generally

www.aacrjournals.org

thought to be responsible for tumor-induced Treg proliferation
(26, 41). Here, we describe a novel mechanism whereby VEGFA, which is probably produced by colorectal tumor cells,
directly promotes Treg proliferation. In patients with CRCs,
Foxp3 expression in CD4þ T cells decreased after surgery (46).
VEGF-A produced by the tumor cells could, at least in part,
explain this phenomenon. Antiangiogenic (AA) molecules
targeting the VEGFR pathway inhibited tumor-induced Treg
accumulation, at least partly, by inhibiting VEGF-induced Treg
proliferation.
Little is known on Treg VEGFR-1 and -2 expression. In mice,
CD4þ T cells express very low levels of VEGFR unless they are
activated with anti-CD3/CD28 (47), and to our knowledge, no
speciﬁc data on CD4þFoxp3þ Tregs have been published.
Suzuki and colleagues have suggested that human Tregs
expressed VEGFR-2 in a TGFb-dependent manner (48). We
show here that Tregs express both VEGFR-1 and -2 in tumorbearing but not in healthy mice. VEGFR-2 is the main mediator
of endothelial cell proliferation, whereas VEGFR-1 seems more
involved in their migration (49). We extend these observations
by showing that VEGF-A–induced Treg proliferation is dependent on Treg VEGFR-2 signaling and not on VEGFR-1 signaling.

Although AA molecules such as sunitinib and anti-VEGF
modulate immunosuppressive cells, it could be interesting to
determine whether these treatments could restore a speciﬁc
antitumor immune response. Suppression of tolerogenic pathways induced by the tumor seems to be a key to successful
cancer immunotherapy. Several approaches have been developed to modulate Tregs in cancer. Low-dose cyclophosphamide inhibits or depletes Tregs in the context of a tumor and
enhances antitumor responses (50). Other strategies using
anti-CD25 or anti-GITR antibodies could modulate Treg numbers or function but would also affect activated effector T cells
(25). Interestingly, we found that VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 pathway
blockade did not deplete all Tregs but simply restored their
proportion to physiologic levels. Thus, to combine antiangiogenic molecules targeting VEGF-A/VEGFR with immunotherapeutic approaches might be interesting to target selectively
Tregs avoiding the depletion of effector T cells and to minimize
the occurrence of autoimmune mediated side effects often
associated with a total Treg depletion.
In conclusion, we show that speciﬁc inhibition of the VEGFA/VEGFR axis is sufﬁcient to prevent Treg accumulation in a
CRC mouse model and in patients with mCRCs. Treg proliferation was enhanced in tumor-bearing animals and this was,
at least in part, due to a direct action of VEGF-A on Tregs via
VEGFR-2. VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 blockade by AA molecules inhibited this proliferation. Combining VEGFA/VEGFR-2–targeting
AA molecules with immunotherapeutic approaches in the
future might thus be relevant in patients with CRCs.
