Abstract
Prostate cancer growth depends on androgen receptor signaling. Androgen ablation therapy induces
expression of constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants that drive disease progression. Taxanes
are a standard of care therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); however, mechanisms underlying
the clinical activity of taxanes are poorly understood. Recent work suggests that the microtubule network of
prostate cells is critical for androgen receptor nuclear translocation and activity. In this study, we used a set of
androgen receptor deletion mutants to identify the microtubule-binding domain of the androgen receptor, which
encompasses the DNA binding domain plus hinge region. We report that two clinically relevant androgen
receptor splice variants, ARv567 and ARv7, differentially associate with microtubules and dynein motor protein,
thereby resulting in differential taxane sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. ARv7, which lacks the hinge region, did not
co-sediment with microtubules or coprecipitate with dynein motor protein, unlike ARv567. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of ARv7 was unaffected by
taxane treatment. In contrast, the microtubule-interacting splice variant ARv567 was sensitive to taxane-induced
microtubule stabilization. In ARv567-expressing LuCap86.2 tumor xenografts, docetaxel treatment was highly
efﬁcacious, whereas ARv7-expressing LuCap23.1 tumor xenografts displayed docetaxel resistance. Our results
suggest that androgen receptor variants that accumulate in CRPC cells utilize distinct pathways of nuclear import
that affect the antitumor efﬁcacy of taxanes, suggesting a mechanistic rationale to customize treatments for
patients with CRPC, which might improve outcomes. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2270–82. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer progression is dependent on continuous
androgen receptor signaling and transcriptional activity. Thus,
strategies designed to effectively inhibit androgen receptor
transcriptional activity and signaling are at the forefront of
current research in prostate cancer. The importance of the
androgen receptor in prostate cancer disease progression is
further highlighted by the fact that many recent therapies are
designed to target the androgen axis, such as enzalutamide
(formerly MDV3100; refs. 1 and 2), an androgen receptor
antagonist, and abiraterone (3), a CYP17 inhibitor that inhibits
androgen synthesis. However, resistance to all forms of androAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology

gen deprivation therapy (ADT), including these next-generation compounds, occurs eventually and results in disease
progression. In fact, despite androgen ablation, the progression
to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains androgen receptor driven (4) because of several mechanisms, including androgen receptor gene ampliﬁcation, in situ androgen
production (5), the presence of ligand-independent androgen
receptor splice variants that localize to the nucleus and are
constitutively active (6, 7), and the appearance of the recently
identiﬁed ligand-binding domain (LBD) mutant form of
ARF876L (8, 9).
Following disease progression on ADT, patients with CRPC
are commonly treated with taxanes, microtubule-stabilizing
drugs, which represent the only class of chemotherapy drugs
that prolongs survival in CRPC (10, 11) and are used as standard
ﬁrst- and second-line chemotherapy. We and others have
recently shown that androgen receptor signaling is inhibited
by taxane treatment, as drug-induced microtubule stabilization abrogates androgen receptor's nuclear translocation and
transcriptional activity (12, 13). Speciﬁcally, we showed that
following ligand stimulation, androgen receptor trafﬁcs on
microtubules with the aid of the microtubule-based minusend–directed motor protein dynein, in order to be efﬁciently
trafﬁcked to the nucleus, where it exerts its transcriptional
activity (12). Importantly, using patient with CRPC-derived
circulating tumor cells, we observed a signiﬁcant correlation
between androgen receptor cytoplasmic sequestration and

AR Variants Predict Taxane Sensitivity in Prostate Cancer

clinical response to taxane chemotherapy. These results demonstrate that androgen receptor inhibition can occur as a result
of microtubule stabilization and is a critical mechanism underlying clinical activity of taxanes in prostate cancer (14).
This newly identiﬁed mechanism of taxane activity predicts that the combination of taxanes with next-generation
androgen receptor targeting drugs would be synergistic
because they both inhibit androgen receptor signaling, by
targeting different components of androgen receptor signaling axis (14). For example, abiraterone inhibits ligand production, whereas taxanes inhibit the nuclear translocation of
the receptor–ligand complex. Despite this prediction, a
recent clinical study reported that the activity of docetaxel
post-abiraterone was lower than expected whereas no
responses to docetaxel were observed in abiraterone-refractory patients (15). These data suggested that perhaps besides
the common mechanism of action (inhibition of androgen
receptor axis) these 2 classes of drugs, taxanes, and androgen receptor inhibitors, might also share a common mechanism of resistance.
Interestingly recent reports have shown that constitutively
active androgen receptor splice variants are overexpressed in
CRPC (16–19) and confer resistance to both enzalutamide and
abiraterone (20, 21). Androgen receptor variants ARv567 and
ARv7 seem to be the 2 most clinically prevalent splice variants,
with ARv567 present in 59% of tumor specimens from patients
with CRPC (19) and arising in response to ADT or abiraterone
treatment (20) and ARv7 present in both benign and malignant
prostate tissues but mostly enriched in metastatic disease
(17, 22). Together these studies show that the presence of
androgen receptor splice variants is common in CRPC and
associates with resistance to current androgen deprivation
therapies (20, 21).
The impact of androgen receptor variant expression on
taxane sensitivity and resistance has not been evaluated. Here,
we set out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the
variants ARv567 and ARv7 nuclear translocation and constitutive activity, and whether their presence would affect taxane
sensitivity. Our results show that ARv567, but not ARv7, utilizes
dynamic microtubules and the dynein motor protein for its
nuclear accumulation and resultant transcriptional activity
and as such only taxane treatment sequesters ARv567 "inactive" in the cytoplasm, whereas it has no effect on ARv7
subcellular localization and nuclear activity. We have also
identiﬁed the minimum microtubule-binding domain on the
androgen receptor, which lies within the DNA-binding domain
and the hinge region. Interestingly, ARv7, which does not
display microtubule-binding properties lacks the hinge region
and thus lacks the main part of the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; refs. 23–26). We show that ARv567 expression
confers docetaxel sensitivity in vivo, whereas expression of the
microtubule-independent ARv7 variant confers resistance.
Taken together, our data identify distinct mechanisms of
cytoplasmic to nuclear trafﬁcking for the 2 androgen receptor
variants, which underlie their differential sensitivity to taxane
treatment, suggesting that variant expression could be used as
a potential predictive biomarker of taxane clinical activity in
CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
PC3 and HEK293T cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and a PC3 stable cell line expressing
mCherry-tubulin (PC3:mCherry-tub) was generated and maintained as previously described (12).
M12 cell line is derived by human prostate epithelial cells
immortalized with the SV40T antigen to produce the poorly
tumorigenic P69SV40T cell line. After injection into athymic
nude mice the produced tumor nodules were reimplanted in
athymic mice, leading to the generation of the M12 cells, which
demonstrated a shorter latency period to tumor formation and
were locally invasive and metastatic compared with the initial
P69SV40T. We chose M12 cells for subsequent transfection
experiments with GFP-tagged AR-wt or androgen receptor
variants as they do not express endogenous AR protein.
GFPþ cells from all 3 androgen receptor cell lines were sorted
using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on a BD
FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and subsequently
expanded in media containing G418 (400 ng/mL).
M12 stable cell lines expressing untagged wild-type androgen receptor (AR-wt), ARv567es and ARv7 or expressing
Cumate-inducible FLAG-tagged AR-wt or variants were generated in Dr. Plymate's laboratory (University of Washington
School of Medicine) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.01 mmol/L dexamethasone (Sigma
Aldrich), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 10
ml/L insulin–transferrin–selenium (Cellgro), 100 IU/mL penicillin plus 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 C with 5% CO2.
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents used were from Sigma
Aldrich. For immunoﬂuorescence, we used the following primary and secondary antibodies: rat monoclonal anti-a-tubulin
(Novus Biologicals), rabbit polyclonal anti-AR-N21 developed
in our lab using as an antigen the ﬁrst 21 amino acids of
androgen receptor and species-matching Alexa Fluor 488 and
Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antibodies from Invitrogen. For
immunoprecipitation we used rat monoclonal anti a-tubulin,
rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Novus Biologicals) and mouse
anti-dynein (Covance) antibodies. For the immunoblot assays,
we used mouse monoclonal anti-AR 441 (Novus Biologicals);
rabbit monoclonal anti-AR (EP670Y from Abcam) speciﬁc for
the C-terminus; mouse monoclonal anti-ARv7 (Precision Antibody) speciﬁc for ARv7 variant; mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG
M2 (Sigma Aldrich); rat monoclonal anti-a-tubulin; rabbit
polyclonal anti-GFP (Abcam); and rabbit polyclonal anti-actin
(Sigma Aldrich) antibodies. Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) and
IRDye 800 (Rockland) conjugated antibodies were as secondary antibodies. Methyltrienolone (R1881) and Paclitaxel were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich and docetaxel from Sanoﬁ
Aventis.
Generation of AR truncated mutants
The full-length GFP-AR plasmid (pEGFP-C1-AR-Q22) was
generously provided by Dr. M. Mancini (Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, TX) and used as the template to generate
all androgen receptor–truncated mutant constructs. All PCRgenerated androgen receptor–truncated mutant constructs
were subcloned into the expression vector pEGFP-C1. All

cloning was performed using AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase
High Fidelity (Invitrogen), with 10 mmol/L forward and reverse
cloning primers (IDT). All primers were designed using the
human androgen receptor mRNA reference sequence (GenBank NM_000044) and are shown in Table 1.
AR 540-724 and AR 725-919 were subcloned into the
p3xFLAG-CMV-14 expression vector (Sigma) with the following speciﬁc primers: AR 540-724 forward: 50 -cgcacgatatcgccaccatgttggagactgccagggacc-30 ; reverse: 50 -cgcacggatccaggcaaggccttggcccac-30 and AR 725-919 forward: 50 -cgcacgatatcgccaccatgggcttccgcaacttacacgtg-30 ; reverse: 50 -cgcacggatccctgggtgtggaaatagatggg-30 . Ampliﬁcation products were
analyzed by Sanger sequencing to conﬁrm the integrity of all
constructs.
Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting
HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged ARwt AR, ARv567, or ARv7 were lysed in TNES buffer and
subjected to immunoprecipitation as previously described
(12).
Microtubule co-sedimentation assay
PC3-mCherry-tubulin and HEK293T cells were transiently
transfected with GFP-tagged AR-wt or GFP-ARv7 or HAtagged ARv567 and subjected to microtubule co-sedimentation assay as previously described (27). Cells were grown in
RPMI 10% FBS þ 1% P/S till transfection in which the media
were replaced with CSS media. No R1881 was added. For the
co-sedimentation assay, brieﬂy, 1 mg of total cell lysate was
ﬁrst precleared by high-speed centrifugation. The pellet
(HSP) containing mostly insoluble cell debris was discarded
after loading a small amount on the gel to identify whether
there was signiﬁcant loss of androgen receptor in the cell
debris, whereas the supernatant (HSS) was supplemented
with exogenous puriﬁed bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton)
reconstituted at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mmol/L in the
presence of 1 mmol/L GTP, and 20 mmol/L paclitaxel (PTX)
and subjected to a cycle of polymerization for 30 minutes at
37 C. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000  g for 30 minutes
at room temperature and the warm supernatant (WS) was
separated from the warm pellet (WP), which was resuspended in an equal volume of PEM buffer. Equal volumes
from each respective fraction were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE
and transferred and immunoblotted with antibodies against
GFP, androgen receptor, a-tubulin, and actin.

Densitometry for each respective protein was performed
using ImageJ (NIH) software and the percentage of the protein
present in the pellet fraction was calculated using the following
formula: % P ¼ 100  WP/(WP þ WS).
Quantitative real-time PCR
M12-cumate inducible AR-wt or variant cells were treated
with cumate (Cu) for 48 hours and then starved for 24 hours
in CSS media. Cells were treated with 1 mmol/L docetaxel
for 4 hours either alone or followed by 10 nmol/L R1881
overnight. qPCR for TMPRSS2, FKBP51, and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was performed as
previously described (28).
Dynamitin overexpression, immunoﬂuorescence, and
confocal microscopy
M12 cells stably expressing the untagged androgen receptor
constructs were transiently transfected with c-myc–tagged
pCMVH50m plasmid containing dynamitin (gifted by R. Vallee,
Columbia University, New York, NY) using FuGENE 6, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours
posttransfection, the cells were treated with the indicated
drugs. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy and
image analysis was performed as previously described (12).
Live cell imaging
PC3-mCherry-tubulin cells were plated on MatTek 5 mm,
poly-D-lysine coated glass bottom dishes and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were maintained in charcoal-stripped RPMI
1640 at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour, pressure-microinjected
intranuclearly with plasmids encoding the different GFP-AR
cDNAs as previously described (12) and then treated postmicroinjection for 2 hours with docetaxel or Noc to affect
microtubules. After protein expression, time-lapse images
were taken using a Spinning Disk microscopy system consisting of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 system ﬁtted with a Yokogawa CSUX1 spinning disk head. Time lapse microscopy and image
analyses were performed as previously described (12).
Xenograft tumors
LuCaP human prostate cancer xenografts were grown as
previously described (20, 29) in noncastrate SCID mice. Brieﬂy,
when the tumor volume reached an estimated size of 200 mm3
(l  w2/2), mice was treated with either vehicle or docetaxel

reached a tumor volume of 1,000 mm3. At this time, all animals
in a group were sacriﬁced. The LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 86.2
prostate cancer xenograft lines were developed by coauthor
RLV at the University of Washington. The preclinical studies
presented here were performed in his laboratory. All animal
studies were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Immunohistochemistry
Androgen receptor immunostaining of explanted LuCaP
tumors was conducted as previously described (30).
Statistical analysis
The P values for androgen receptor nuclear localization in
control-, taxane-, and nocodazole-treated cells were calculated
using one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons with
Bonferroni adjustments using Stata Statistical Software:
release 10. The P value for androgen receptor nuclear versus
cytoplasmic localization in M12 cells were calculated using 2tailed unpaired t test.
Image analysis
For all images, segmentation of the nuclei and the cellular
area was done using MATLAB, MathWorks. Using the 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole images, we applied a unimodal
thresholding algorithm (31) to identify the nuclear areas for
each cell. We then computed the total intensity for the nuclear
areas in the androgen receptor images and obtained the overall
androgen receptor nuclear intensity for each cell. We used the
coordinates of the centroids of the nuclei to build a Voronoi
diagram (32) and identify the approximate area of the cytoplasm for each cell. We then computed the total intensity in the
androgen receptor images for each cellular area, including the
cytoplasmic and nuclear areas. The percentage of androgen
receptor nuclear accumulation was calculated as the ratio of
the nuclear to cellular androgen receptor for each individual
cell.

Results
Microtubule binding is mediated by the C-terminal
domain of the androgen receptor
We have previously shown that wild-type androgen receptor
(AR-wt) associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton and that
this association is important for androgen receptor cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity
in CRPC (12, 14). However, the androgen receptor protein
domain required for microtubule association remains
unknown. To determine the microtubule binding domain on
the androgen receptor protein, we performed a microtubule
co-sedimentation assay using cells expressing overlapping
truncated androgen receptor mutants, which we generated
by a serial mutagenesis approach. The microtubule co-sedimentation assay is an assay routinely used to analyze proteins
that speciﬁcally bind to microtubule polymers. The basic
principles of the assay involve addition of exogenous puriﬁed
microtubule protein to a crude cell extract, which is then
subjected to a cycle of polymerization in the presence of the
microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel. Any cellular proteins

www.aacrjournals.org

that have afﬁnity for the microtubule polymer will co-sediment
with the tubulin pellet following ultracentrifugation at 100,000
 g. Following centrifugation, the pellet (microtubules and
associated cell proteins) and supernatant (soluble tubulin
dimers and all other cell proteins) fractions are loaded on
adjacent wells of an SDS-PAGE, transferred and immunoblotted for the proteins of interest.
Initially, 2 large androgen receptor truncations were generated and subcloned into a pEGFP-C1 vector: the N-terminal
domain (N-ter, aa 1-539) encompassing exon 1 of the androgen
receptor and the C-terminal domain (C-ter, aa 540-919) encompassing the DNA binding domain, the hinge region and the
ligand binding domain of androgen receptor (Fig. 1A). Each
deletion mutant was individually expressed in either PC3:
mCherry-tub or HEK293T cells by transient transfection and
cells were subjected to microtubule co-sedimentation in order
to assess each proteins' association with microtubule polymers. In this assay, cell lysates from each condition (HSS) were
supplemented with exogenous puriﬁed tubulin and subjected
to a cycle of microtubule polymerization at 37 C and in the
presence of GTP and Taxol. Under these conditions, puriﬁed
tubulin along with endogenous cellular tubulin is robustly
polymerized enabling microtubule interactions with cellular
proteins. Following the polymerization reaction, high-speed
centrifugation separates microtubule polymers along with any
cellular proteins with afﬁnity for them into the WP fraction,
whereas soluble tubulin and other proteins that do not have
afﬁnity for microtubules segregate with the WS. The distribution of androgen receptor proteins between the WP and WS
fractions indicates its ability to associate with the microtubule
polymers. Efﬁcient tubulin polymerization was observed in all
conditions.
Our results revealed that the C-terminal domain of GFP
associated preferentially with microtubule polymers in both
cell lines (Figs. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1), as 86% of the Cter AR cofractionated with microtubules in the WP fraction,
similar to the AR-wt. In contrast, N-ter AR showed minimal
association (13%) with polymerized tubulin (Figs. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S1). Tubulin was efﬁciently polymerized
in all conditions as shown by the majority of tubulin (over 80%)
found in respective WP fractions.
To further narrow down the minimum androgen receptor
microtubule binding domain, we generated 7 additional androgen receptor truncation mutants within the C-ter region of
androgen receptor (Fig. 1C). The truncations were designed to
correspond to androgen receptor functional domains as well as
to cover the entire C-ter region, as follows: the DNA binding
domain (aa 559-624), the hinge region (aa 625-663), the DNA
binding domain plus the hinge region (aa 559-663), and fragments aa 540-724, 540-558, 664-724, and 725-919. These deletion mutants were subcloned into a pEGFP-C1 vector, with the
exception of aa 540-724 and 725-919 mutants, which were
subcloned into a p3XFLAG-CMV vector as the GFP-tag gave
rise to a protein of approximately 50 kDa, which is also the size
of tubulin, whose excess made the detection of the truncated
proteins very challenging. Of the 7 truncation mutants, the AR
559-663, corresponding to the DNA BD plus the hinge region,
showed the most extensive association with the microtubule

samples were centrifuged at 100,000  g to separate the microtubule polymers (WP) from the soluble tubulin dimers (WS), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
immunoblotted for the presence of androgen receptor and tubulin as indicated. HSP, high-speed pellet containing cellular proteins that aggregated

and anti-androgen receptor (EP670Y) speciﬁc for the C-terminal androgen receptor, anti-tubulin and anti-actin antibodies. In D, all androgen receptor deletion
mutants were detected with an anti-GFP antibody except for the androgen receptor 540–724 and androgen receptor 725–919 deletion mutants that were
detected with an anti-FLAG antibody.

polymers with 35% protein seen in the WP (Fig. 1D). Surprisingly, none of these androgen receptor deletion mutants
showed as extensive association with the microtubule polymer
fraction as the original C-ter AR (Fig. 1B), suggesting that likely
there is contribution from different parts of the androgen
receptor within its C-terminus region for effective tubulin
association.
ARv567 associates more extensively with microtubules
compared with ARv7
We then sought to investigate whether any of the 2 most
clinically prevalent androgen receptor splice variants with
truncations in their C-terminus, namely ARv567 (19) and ARv7
(17, 18), would associate with microtubules similar to the ARwt. Microtubule co-sedimentation revealed that the ARv567

2274

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

variant cofractionated almost exclusively (70%) with microtubule polymers in the WP fraction, whereas ARv7 only partially
cofractionated with microtubules at 42% (Fig. 2B).
ARv567, but not ARv7, nuclear translocation is impaired
by microtubules targeting drugs
The distinct pattern of microtubule association exhibited by
the 2 androgen receptor variants suggested potentially distinct
mechanisms of nuclear translocation. To test this hypothesis,
we perturbed the microtubule network by 2-hour treatment
with drugs that either stabilize (docetaxel) or depolymerize
(nocodazole) microtubules and assessed androgen receptor
variant nuclear accumulation in cells microinjected with GFPtagged ARv567 or ARv7. Live cell confocal microscopy was then
used to image the dynamics of androgen receptor variant

variants ARv567, encoding exons 1–4 and the ﬁrst 10 amino acids of exon 8, and ARv7, encoding exons 1–3 and a cryptic exon of 16 amino acids.
B and C, A microtubule co-sedimentation assay using whole cell lysate (HSS) from PC3:mCh-tub cells transfected with either GFP-AR (wt), HA-ARv567, or
GFP-ARv7 was carried out as in Fig. 1. AR-wt androgen receptor was used as positive controls of microtubule binding. Proteins from each of the fractions were
immunoblotted using anti–androgen receptor speciﬁc for the C-terminus (EP670Y) to detect GFP-AR-C-ter; anti-AR 441 to detect GFP-AR (wt), HA-ARv567
and GFP-ARv7; anti-tubulin and anti-actin antibodies. Tubulin was detected as microtubules in the WP in each condition. Boxes indicate the distribution of
each protein between WP and WS fractions per condition. The extent of each variant's association with the microtubule polymer (%WP) was quantiﬁed by
densitometry as in Fig. 1 and is displayed to the right of each immunoblot. For tubulin, a range of values is shown in the %WP quantitation, reﬂecting each of the
8 reactions performed. Actin was used as a negative control for microtubule association and is found in the supernatant fractions (WS) in all conditions.

nuclear accumulation by obtaining z-stack images every 10
minutes for a total of 120 min.
Representative images from each condition are shown
in Fig. 3 and reveal that the nuclear accumulation of ARv567
was signiﬁcantly impaired following microtubule perturbation
with either drug, while ARv7 remained largely unaffected in the
nucleus (see movies in Supplement). Interestingly, and in
agreement with published reports (17–19, 33), the 2 variants
were found predominantly in the nucleus of untreated cells as
soon as the GFP-tagged protein was expressed following
microinjection (time 0). Despite their initial nuclear localization at baseline, the 2 variants exhibited entirely distinct
responses to drug-induced microtubule disruption. Quantitation of the extent of nuclear ARv567 revealed a signiﬁcant
decrease in its nuclear localization following microtubule
perturbation at all time points tested (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S1 P < 0.01 at baseline and P < 0.001 at all other time
points). The integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton was
assessed in each condition before time lapse image acquisition
and is shown in the right panels of the ﬁgure, indicating
effective drug-target engagement for each of the conditions,
microtubule bundling with docetaxel (Fig. 3A and B, middle
row, arrowhead) and depolymerized tubulin with nocodazole
treatment (Fig. 3A and B,, third row). In contrast and despite
effective drug-target engagement, drug treatment had no effect

on the other clinically relevant and constitutively active androgen receptor splice variant, ARv7 (18). Treatment of the ARv7microinjected cells with microtubule targeting drugs did not
impact this variant's nuclear localization at any time point
(Fig. 3B and D and Supplementary Table S1). Taken together,
these data suggested that ARv567 but not ARv7 is dependent
on microtubules for effective nuclear accumulation.
To extend these observations, we used the M12 prostate
cancer cell line, a tumorigenic cell line representative of the
metastatic stage of prostate cancer, to engineer isogenic cell
lines stably expressing GFP-tagged AR-wt AR, ARv567, or ARv7.
We then investigated the effects of docetaxel treatment on the
nuclear localization of each of the GFP-tagged receptors, as
seen by GFP ﬂuorescence (Fig. 4A and B) or antibody-based
detection (Supplementary Fig. S2). In agreement with our
previous data (12), docetaxel inhibited ligand-induced AR-wt
nuclear accumulation downstream of microtubule stabilization (Fig. 4A, arrowhead for microtubule bundles, arrows for
cytoplasmic androgen receptor). Docetaxel treatment also
inhibited the nuclear localization of the ligand-independent
ARv567 variant (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in the
presence of R1881, which did not induce any further nuclear
accumulation of ARv567 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). However,
as shown in Fig. 4C, docetaxel treatment failed to alter the
nuclear localization of ARv7 variant in the absence or presence

Figure 3. Microtubule targeting drugs inhibit ARv567 nuclear trafﬁcking but have no effect on ARv7 nuclear accumulation. PC3:mCh-tub cells were microinjected
with GFP-tagged ARv567 or GFP-tagged ARv7 and incubated for 2-hour post-microinjection with either 1 mmol/L docetaxel (TXT) or 10 mmol/L nocodazole
(Noc). Time lapse images were obtained with a spinning disk confocal microscope by acquiring an entire Z-stack at 10-minute intervals for 2 hours.
Shown are maximum intensity projections of representative PC3: mCherry-Tub cells expressing GFP-ARv567 (A) or GFP-ARv7 (B) at the indicated time

from the sum projection and the percentage of nuclear androgen receptor was calculated using the following formula: % nuclear androgen receptor ¼ 100 

n ¼ 10; 120 minutes: n ¼ 3. N values for ARv7: Control 0 to 120 minutes: n ¼ 9. Docetaxel pretreated 0 to 120 minutes: n ¼ 9. Noc pretreated 0 to 100 minutes:

of R1881 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, we quantiﬁed
the extent of androgen receptor nuclear localization for each
condition by calculating the ratio of nuclear to total cellular
androgen receptor for each individual cell, as described in the
Materials and Methods (Fig. 4D). This analysis revealed that
docetaxel treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease of
nuclear localization in AR-wt and ARv567, but had no effect
on ARv7 conﬁrming and corroborating the live cell imaging
results that showed that ARv7 does not depend on microtubules for its nuclear trafﬁcking. To assess the effect of docetaxel
treatment on androgen receptor transcriptional activity, we
performed quantitative real-time PCR using transcriptional
targets previously shown to be differentially induced by AR-wt
and androgen receptor variants. Speciﬁcally, TMPRSS2 was

2276

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

identiﬁed as a target speciﬁc for AR-wt whereas FKBP51 was
transcriptionally activated by the androgen receptor variants
(18, 34). In this assay, we used M12 cells expressing inducible
AR-wt or variants. As seen in Fig. 4E, in M12 cells, the AR-wt
increased TMPRSS2 expression and docetaxel treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited it, consistent with the drug's effects on
androgen receptor cytoplasmic sequestration. In the case of
the androgen receptor variants, TMPRSS2 is no longer regulated whereas FKBP51 transcription is induced by both ARv7
and ARv567. Here we see that docetaxel treatment signiﬁcantly
inhibited ARv567-mediated induction of FKBP51 but had no
effect on ARv7 transcriptional activity, in agreement with the
differential effects of docetaxel on each variant's nuclear
localization (Fig. 4B and C). These data conﬁrm that the

androgen receptor variants have a distinct transcriptome

Dynamitin overexpression impairs ARv567 nuclear
translocation, whereas it has no effect on ARv7
To further dissect the mechanism regulating the cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of each variant, we next
investigated the involvement of the minus-end directed microtubule motor protein dynein, because we have shown that it
mediates nuclear translocation (12). Dynein works in concert
with several accessory proteins to drive subcellular motile
functions, including dynactin, which is an adapter that mediates the binding of dynein to cargo structures enhancing
dynein's motor function. Overexpression of the dynactin-asso-

ciated protein, dynamitin, which disrupts dynein–cargo interactions (35), was used to dissect the involvement of dynein in
the transport of the androgen receptor splice variants to the
nucleus.

for double-labeling immunoﬂuorescence with anti-AR and
anti-c-myc antibodies. Overexpression of dynamitin impaired nuclear accumulation of ARv567 (Fig. 5A, dashed

no effect on the nuclear accumulation of ARv7 (Fig. 5B

ARv7 was observed (Fig. 5C).
To further investigate the role of the dynein microtubulebased motor protein on androgen receptor variant trafﬁcking,
we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in
HEK293T cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged AR-wt
AR, ARv567, or ARv7 to determine their putative association
with dynein. Co-precipitation using an antibody against GFP
revealed that both the AR-wt AR and ARv567, but not ARv7,
associated with dynein (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data
support a model whereby AR-wt AR and ARv567 utilize microtubules and dynein-dependent transport for their nuclear
accumulation and subsequent activity. However, ARv7 does

expression on taxane sensitivity in vivo, we compared the
effects of docetaxel on the growth of 2 LuCaP xenograft tumors

SCID mice. There were 15 mice in each group. As shown in Fig.
6A, LuCaP 86.2, which is resistant to castration and driven by
ARv567, has its growth markedly suppressed by a low dose of
docetaxel of 5 mg/kg (P < 0.01 control vs. docetaxel treated), a
dose that we have previously shown to be ineffective on the
growth of LuCaP 35 xenograft expressing primarily AR-wt (29).
In contrast, there was no effect of docetaxel on the growth of
LuCaP23.1 tumors (P ¼ NS control vs. docetaxel treatment).
The effect of docetaxel treatment on androgen receptor nuclear accumulation was further assessed by immunohistochemistry on explanted LuCaP tumors, as previously described (30).
Quantitation of androgen receptor nuclear accumulation in

tumors from untreated versus treated animals revealed that
docetaxel treatment resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant
reduction of nuclear androgen receptor following in LuCaP86.2
tumors, whereas it had a minimal effect on LuCaP 23.1 tumors
(Fig. 6B and C). These data support the hypothesis that druginduced inhibition of androgen receptor nuclear accumulation
underlies taxane antitumor activity and show that androgen
receptor variant expression can determine taxane sensitivity in
vivo.

receptor signaling (36). Androgen deprivation therapy alone is
effective in a subset of patients with prostate cancer; however,
many patients progress to CRPC. The discovery of androgen
receptor splice variants has provided signiﬁcant insight into
mechanisms of disease progression and ADT resistance. However, the potential impact of androgen receptor splice variant
expression on chemotherapy has not been investigated. Currently, the taxanes represent the standard of care in CRPC
treatment. However, the therapeutic beneﬁt of taxane treatment cannot be indeﬁnitely sustained and currently we fail
to understand the molecular basis of clinical taxane resistance. Herein, we provide evidence that the presence of
androgen receptor splice variants may affect sensitivity to
taxane treatment.
The clinical signiﬁcance of these variants is highlighted by
studies showing that elevated ARv7 expression is associated
with more rapid disease recurrence following radical prostatectomy for localized disease (17, 18). In addition, it was
recently shown that ARv7 is regulated by the transcriptional
factor FOXO1 in a PTEN-PI3K-AKT dependent manner (37, 38),
which is a pathway activated in 50% of prostate cancers.
The ARv567 variant, arising through skipping of exons 5 to 7
was identiﬁed in a panel of 25 different prostate cancer
xenografts, termed the LuCaP series, most of which were
derived from metastases obtained from men with CRPC after
prolonged exposure to androgen-deprivation therapy (19).
Unlike ARv7, ARv567 retains the hinge region that contains
the second and most important part of androgen receptor's
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of aa
629
RKLKKL634 and responsible of AR/importin interaction
(23, 26, 39). The hinge region contains also some well-deﬁned
control sites for androgen receptor activity, being target for
acetylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation (23, 25).
However, even though androgen receptor variants have been
found to increase the expression of full-length androgen
receptor and enhance its transcriptional activity in the absence
of ligand (19) their expression regulation and functional relationships had not been fully dissected. Studies on the transcriptional programs induced by variant signaling have shown
that an adaptive shift toward androgen receptor–variant
mediated signaling occurs in a subset of CRPC tumors, and
thus suggesting that AR variants have different gene signatures
from full-length androgen receptor potentially contributing to
drug resistance to androgen receptor–targeted therapies such
as abiraterone and enzalutamide (20, 21, 34). However, a recent
report argues that androgen receptor variants induce genes
that constitute a subset of the genes regulated by androgen
receptor full length, rather than having a distinct transcriptional signature, and therefore, androgen receptor variants are
constitutive and independent effectors of androgen receptor
transcriptional program (21). Regardless of these discrepancies, the data on androgen receptor variants strongly suggest
that their expression arises following castration and plays a
role in the progression of prostate cancer.
For the variants to exert their transcriptional activity they
have to be localized to the nucleus. Although the published
literature highlights the strong nuclear presence of the variants, our results are the ﬁrst to show a differential preference

2280

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

of androgen receptor variants for microtubule-mediated
nuclear transport; ARv567 being microtubule- and dyneindependent and ARv7 being microtubule independent (Figs.
4 and 5). Interestingly, we showed that the C-terminus of
androgen receptor mediates microtubule binding (Fig. 1) and
that the speciﬁc microtubule-binding domain comprises of the
DNA-BD together with the adjacent hinge region (aa 559663; Fig. 1C). This ﬁnding can readily explain the reduced
association of ARv7 with microtubules, as ARv7 lacks the hinge
region that mediates microtubule binding (Fig. 1C) and is also
involved in the regulation of androgen receptor nuclear translocation and intranuclear motility (40). We were surprised to
ﬁnd that none of the individual C-terminus truncation mutants
displayed as extensive microtubule association as the entire Cter AR (aa 540-919; Fig. 2B and C). These results suggest that
perhaps nonsequential regions of androgen receptor may
come together in 3-dimension to generate the surface of
microtubule interaction, indicating a larger and globular surface required for protein–protein interaction.
Additional studies using cryo-electron microscopy and
recombinant full-length androgen receptor and androgen
receptor variant proteins are currently ongoing in order to
investigate the structural interaction between androgen receptor and its variants with microtubules. Our preliminary results
have revealed that recombinant puriﬁed full-length androgen
receptor protein binds directly to puriﬁed microtubules in vitro
(data not shown), suggesting that androgen receptor may bind
microtubules not only for the purpose of trafﬁcking but also as
a microtubule-associated protein potentially regulating polymer stability and dynamics.
We and others have previously shown that taxane treatment
inhibits androgen receptor nuclear translocation and activity
in prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived CTCs (12, 13)
and that this mechanism underlies at least in part clinical
response to taxane treatment (14). While androgen receptor
nuclear accumulation remains a critical factor responsible for
androgen receptor transcriptional activity, the pathways regulating androgen receptor–variant nuclear translocation
remain poorly understood. Our data support the requirement
of the hinge region (aa 625-663) for androgen receptor microtubule association and downstream nuclear translocation,
whereas other reports show that the NTD/DNA-BD core (aa
1-627) alone—in the absence of the hinge region—is sufﬁcient
for receptor nuclear translocation (28). At the same time
mutation of 3 key residues of the hinge region, namely
K630A, K632A, and K633A, completely abrogates nuclear accumulation of full-length androgen receptor in agreement with
our results. These data suggest that in addition to microtubulemediated androgen receptor nuclear transport, there are additional pathways that operate in the absence of the hinge region,
like in the case of ARv7.
Clinically, although 50% of men respond to docetaxel following progression after standard androgen ablation, some
men clearly are sensitive to taxanes and have a prolonged
response, for reasons not well understood. In this report, we
show that taxane-mediated microtubule stabilization differentially affects androgen receptor variant trafﬁcking and transcriptional activity, raising the possibility that these variants

AR Variants Predict Taxane Sensitivity in Prostate Cancer

may predict sensitivity or resistance to taxane chemotherapy.
In agreement with this hypothesis, we show that LuCaP human
xenografts expressing ARv567 or full-length androgen receptor
co-expressed with ARv7 show differential sensitivity to docetaxel treatment (Fig. 6). Interestingly, LuCaP 86.2 expressing
predominantly ARv567 variant was the most sensitive to
taxane treatment, consistent with the drug's ability to inhibit
this variant's nuclear localization and activity. While our
animal data do not indicate that androgen receptor inhibition
is the only mechanism by which docetaxel is effective in
prostate cancer, as we also showed that LuCaP xenografts
that do not express high levels of ARv567 can respond to higher
dose of docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4), LuCaP 86.2 is clearly
an outlier in the sensitivity and duration of response to
docetaxel.
Taken together, these data suggest that tumors driven by
ARv567 may be marked as those that, even if resistant to
next generation androgen receptor–targeting drugs, will
likely beneﬁt most by taxane treatment. Conversely, our
data suggest that tumors predominantly expressing ARv7
will likely be resistant to taxane chemotherapy and that
alternate treatments able to inhibit ARv7 transcriptional
activity might be beneﬁcial. Although the clinical impact
of ARv7 expression on patient response to next generation
androgen receptor–targeting drugs is not yet determined,
our ﬁndings suggest that ARv7 expression may constitute a
common mechanism of resistance to both taxanes and
androgen receptor inhibitors. In agreement with this
hypothesis, a recent clinical report showed that the activity
of docetaxel in post- abiraterone–treated patients was lower
than expected whereas no responses to docetaxel were
observed in abiraterone-refractory patients (15). Moreover,
a recent but not published clinical trial showed that men
with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who
received docetaxel given at the start of ADT lived longer
than patients who received hormone therapy alone (41).
These recent ﬁndings are encouraging and strongly support
the hypothesis that next-generation androgen receptor inhibitors and taxanes act on the same pathway (even if at a
different level), and are synergistic in patients who presumably do not express signiﬁcant amounts of androgen receptor variants because they are still responsive to ADT.

The data presented in this study provide insights into the
regulation of androgen receptor–variant trafﬁcking and
activity in prostate cancer, link their expression with the
therapeutic beneﬁt of taxane treatment and suggest that
the presence of androgen receptor variants may determine
the clinical efﬁcacy of taxane chemotherapy. Evaluating and
discriminating androgen receptor variants in prostate cancer tumor cells can help clinicians tailor treatment in patient
with CRPC by identifying patients who are most likely to
beneﬁt from taxane chemotherapy.
