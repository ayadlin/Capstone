ABSTRACT:

Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is increasingly regarded as a pro-tumoral target in the
treatment of human cancers. Currently, little is known about HO-1 and its role
in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to regulate apoptosis in response to
chemotherapy. Recently, we showed that HO-1 protects AML samples from tumour
necrosis factor-α (TNF)-induced apoptosis - it being regulated by transcription
factors Nrf2, NF-ĸB and AP-1. This study aims to analyse the role of HO-1 in regulating
apoptosis in AML cells in response to two front-line chemotherapeutic agents
used for AML, cytarabine and daunorubicin. Here we show that HO-1 expression
in AML samples was increased in response to both cytarabine and daunorubicin
treatment, and micro RNA (miRNA) silenced HO-1 expression in combination
with either daunorubicin or cytarabine induced a greater apoptotic responses in
AML cells. Moreover, we showed that both daunorubicin and cytarabine induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to induce apoptosis in AML. However,
ROS-dependent induction of HO-1 was limiting the apoptotic response that is seen
in AML towards cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. These findings suggest
concurrent inhibition of HO-1 expression in conjunction with chemotherapeutic
treatment would improve the number of cases who reach complete remission.

INTRODUCTION

A number of mechanisms have been suggested to
contribute to drug-resistance in AML. These include,
the targeted cells fail to undergo apoptosis in response
to the chemotherapy agent, drugs failing to reach their
intracellular targets or the removal by the ABC membrane
transporter protein, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp is a efflux
transporter, present within the cell’s plasma membrane,
and its expression in AML has been reported to be
relatively low, however an increase in its expression after
drug treatment and also at the point of relapse, have been
reported [8]. Moreover, Galmarini et al have shown that
high levels of 5’-nucleotidase, which is involved in DNA
repair and membrane transport, is related to the poor
prognosis of AML patients [9]. These studies suggest
that AML cells evolve to regulate pathways that provide
protection against toxic chemotherapeutic agents.
Recently, we reported that haem oxygenase-1 (HO-

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a malignancy
of haemopoietic progenitor cells [1] and accounts for
approximately 1% of all cancer deaths. At present the
standard induction treatment for younger fitter patients
consists of the antimetabolite cytarabine plus the
anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin [2, 3]. Depending
on clinicopathological characteristics, patients who go
into remission would commonly receive consolidation
therapy with either high dose cytarabine or allogeneic
stem cell transplant . Despite these intensive treatment
strategies, significant numbers of patients relapse and
only approximately 50% of younger fitter patients can be
cured. The treatment outcomes are dependent on a variety
of clinical and biological factors including cytogenetics,
age and drug-resistance [2, 4-7].

1) has an important function in protecting human AML
cells from TNF-induced apoptosis [10]. To date, three
isoforms of haem oxygenase have been identified, HO-1,
HO-2 and HO-3 [11]. HO-1, which is the most intriguing
in terms of providing protection against cellular stresses,
regulates cellular haem levels, and converts intracellular
haem into carbon monoxide, free iron and biliverdin [11].
Biliverdin is further reduced into the potent antioxidant
bilirubin [12, 13] by biliverdin reductase [14]. This
metabolite possesses cytoprotective properties including
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptosis [15,

16]. HO-2 is constitutively expressed and HO-3 is not
catalytically active and thought to be involved in oxygensensing. HO-1 belongs to the heat shock protein family
(Hsp-32), thus its expression is triggered by a variety
of stress-inducing stimuli including, UV irradiation,
hyperthermia,
inflammatory
cytokines,
bacterial
endotoxins and heavy metals [17-21]. The regulation of
HO-1 is under the control of signalling components [22,
23] and many transcription factors including nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB), NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and
activator protein-1 (AP-1)[24, 25].

is in fact down-regulated in AML by their constitutively

brings HO-1 levels back to more normal levels, providing

RESULTS

µM of cytarabine is a clinically achievable concentration
obtained in situations where a standard dose of cytarabine
is administered [28]. Table 1 shows the relevant clinical
data for the AML patient samples tested in these studies.
Figure 1A shows apoptosis for both AML samples and
AML cell lines in response to both cytarabine (0.5 µM
and 1 µM) and daunorubicin (0.2 µM and 0.5 µM) in
concentration-dependent manners. Figure 1B shows
that cytarabine (0.5 µM), daunorubicin (0.2 µM) or a
combination of both cytarabine and daunorubicin induce
cell death by apoptosis as measured by annexin-V and PI

AML resistance to cytarabine and daunorubicin.
To understand the mechanisms of chemoresistance
in AML cells to cytarabine and daunorubicin, we have
examined the levels of apoptosis of primary AML
samples and AML cell lines in response to varying
concentrations of these drugs. The drug concentrations
selected were based on previous studies [26, 27]. One

is a range of sensitivities to the chemotherapeutics and
that there are significant levels of living cells that remain
resistant to these cytotoxic agents, even in combination.

expression of this cytoprotective gene in AML cells.
Figure 2A shows that both cytarabine and daunorubicin
induce HO-1 mRNA expression by 24 h of drug exposure
in both AML cell lines and AML patient samples. Figure
2B also reiterates the above point in AML cell lines and
shows the effect on HO-1 mRNA expression of 24 h
drug exposure to cytarabine and daunorubicin alone or
in combination. Interestingly, HO-1 mRNA expression
is increased further when the cells are exposed to both
chemotherapeutic agents together. Figure 2C shows

a Western blot indicating that HO-1 protein was also
induced by both cytarabine and daunorubicin after 24 h
drug exposure. Thus these front-line chemotherapeutic
agents are able to readily induce HO-1 in AML cells.
Furthermore, at the concentrations used, daunorubicin is
somewhat better at killing off U937 cells than is cytarabine
(Figure 1), with daunorubicin only weakly inducing
HO-1 in U937 cells compared to cytarabine’s induction
(Figure 2C). This correlates perfectly with a role for HO-1
induction in drug-resistance in U937 cells. Likewise, it is
notable that both agents can equally induce strong HO-1
expression in THP-1 cells, with a similar inability towards
efficient cytotoxicity in those cells.

THP-1 cells in response to cytarabine and daunorubicin
treatment over a 6 h time period. N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
is an antioxidant scavenger which quenches ROS activity
present within the cellular environment. NAC was used
to determine if removing ROS would block cytarabineand daunorubicin-induced HO-1 expression. Finally, we
wanted to determine whether NAC could block apoptosis
induced by cytarabine and daunorubicin. Figure 4B show
that NAC effectively inhibits apoptosis in cytarabineand daunorubicin-treated THP-1 and U937 cells, thus
demonstrating that ROS are responsible for cytarabineor daunorubicin-induced cell death of AML cells. Figure
4C shows a decrease in mRNA HO-1 expression in the
presence of NAC compared to that of the control, further
implicating ROS in the chemotherapeutic-induction of
HO-1 and its consequent cytoprotection observed in AML.

Silencing HO-1 increases AML cell apoptosis to
cytarabine and daunorubicin.

DISCUSSION

We developed a lentivirus-based miRNA delivery
system on a GFP backbone to target HO-1 mRNA
knockdown and silence HO-1 expression in AML cells.
Figure 3A shows that we can achieve > 95% transfection
efficiency as measured by flow cytometry. Figure 3B
shows that HO-1 mRNA expression in both THP-1 and
U937 control and HO-1-silenced cells, with greater
than 95% knock-down of endogenous HO-1 mRNA
levels observed. Figure 3B also indicates HO-1 protein
expression in THP-1 control and HO-1-silenced cells, with
almost no detectable levels of HO-1 observed specifically
with the HO-1 miRNA lentivirus. Next we wanted to
determine if either cytarabine or daunorubicin induced
HO-1 expression could protect AML cells from apoptosis.
To do this we used lentiviral-based miRNA HO-1
knockdown cells (compared to control negative miRNA
lentiviral knockdown cells) treated with either cytarabine
or daunorubicin for 24 h. Figure 3Cand 3D show the
apoptotic responses of control- and HO-1-silenced THP-1
and U937 cells after treatment with either cytarabine or
daunorubicin. The HO-1-silenced THP-1 and U937 cells
were more susceptible to apoptosis compared to the nonsilenced cells. These findings indicate that HO-1 is playing
a part in cellular protection mechanisms observed in
apoptosis-resistance towards cytarabine or daunorubicin.

In this study we have investigated the role of HO-1
in protecting AML cells from apoptosis in response
to cytarabine and daunorubicin. We have previously
shown that HO-1 can protect AML cells from apoptosis
in response to the proteosome inhibitor, bortezomib and
the NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 [29, 30]. In the present
work, we show that expression of HO-1 is induced in
response to cytarabine, daunorubicin and a combination
of both agents. Interestingly HO-1 mRNA expression
is increased further when the cells are treated with a
combination of the drugs which one would expect because
of the presence of both agents acting via differing modes
of action to induce apoptosis. Referring to Figure 1B,
oddly the percentage of viable cells present within the
sample population is actually between that of separate
cytarabine and daunorubicin exposure. Furthermore
silencing HO-1 expression in combination with either
cytarabine or daunorubicin induces a greater apoptotic
response in AML cells. Finally we show that both
cytarabine and daunorubicin cause AML cells to generate
ROS production and this in turn induces HO-1 expression,
which subsequently reinforces any cellular resistance
towards these drugs. A prior report has already shown
ROS production in the presence of cytarabine in U937
cells [26]. These results provide novel insight into the role
of HO-1 in protecting human AML cells from cytarabine
and daunorubicin.
In a broad range of morphologic and cytogenetic
subtypes of primary human AML cells and human AML
cell lines, both cytarabine and daunorubicin consistently
induce HO-1 expression by 24 h. We also examined the
effects of daunorubicin and cytarabine on HO-1 expression
at earlier time points finding no increase in HO-1 mRNA
levels (not shown). This time lag between addition of
drug and HO-1 induction in AML cells is interesting. We
hypothesise that this is likely to be due to the complex
nature of the HO-1 promoter and its regulation. Nuhn et

ROS modulates the apoptotic potential of
cytarabine and daunorubicin in AML cells.
We have previously shown in AML cells that
H2DCFDA oxidation occurs in response to the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib and also in response to NF-ĸB
inhibitor BAY 11-7082 [29, 30]. We have also shown
that ROS induced by these drugs are responsible for
upregulating HO-1 expression. Here we wanted to
determine if cytarabine and daunorubicin increased
HO-1 expression through a ROS-dependent mechanism.

al have reported that HO-1 expression is usually increased
in human cancer cells and is also increased further by the
addition of cytotoxic agents [31]. Subsequent silencing
of HO-1 in these AML cell lines significantly decreases
the percentage of viable AML cells present within the
population treated with fixed doses of either cytarabine
or daunorubicin. Therefore we suggest inhibiting
HO-1 could potentially enhance AML cell response to
these chemotherapeutic agents in vivo. Fang et al have
determined the presence of a HO-1 inhibitor in vivo can
enhance tumour responsiveness to chemotherapeutic
agents [32].
Protection from apoptosis conferred to AML cells by
HO-1 in the current study appears to be medicated through
regulation of ROS produced in response to cytarabine
and daunorubicin exposure. With regards to HO-1 and its
ability to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis, there
are a number of different proposed mechanisms. The
first is by decreasing the levels of the pro-oxidant, haem
[32, 33]; the second, by increasing the concentration of
bilirubin, an antioxidant [32]; and the final mechanism is
by increasing the levels of carbon monoxide, curiously
generally thought to be an anti-apoptotic molecule [13,
34, 35]. Together, these mechanisms act either alone or
in a combined way to protect cancer cells from apoptosis.
What is intriguing about AML cells is that they seem to
have evolved to manipulate this pathway to provide it
with a growth advantage over normal non-cancerous
control cells. AML (or any cancerous cell) probably
doesn’t set out to be drug-resistant, but there is a varying
population of cancer stem cells that are relatively able
to cope with any cytotoxic insult they receive from
cytarabine or daunorubicin. We show here that these
resistance mechanisms heavily involve HO-1. A patient’s
HO-1 response to chemotherapeutics will go a long way
in determining their clinical outcome.
In our previous study we showed that basal levels of
HO-1 are low compared to normal cells and that NF-κB
activation reduced basal HO-1 expression. Furthermore,
Nrf-2 activation could override this regulation [29]. In
fact any number of transcription factors can regulate HO-1
expression [24, 25]. In this study we concentrated on the
role of HO-1 expression in regulating chemotherapyinduced apoptosis but cannot preclude the involvement of
other transcriptional elements.
In summary we report that silencing HO-1
significantly increases in vitro sensitivity of AML cells to
cytarabine and daunorubicin, two front-line chemotherapy
agents currently widely used to treat this type of leukaemia.
Previously we have shown that HO-1 plays an important
role in protecting AML cells from apoptotic stimuli and
here we propose that this is likely to be clinically relevant
and thus HO-1 warrants further investigation as a target in
future therapeutic strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
The AML-derived cell lines THP-1 and U937, were
obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures,
where cell identity is confirmed by cytogenetic analuysis.
Cells were used in the laboratory for a maximum of 6
months post-revival from liquid nitrogen storage, to ensure
integrity and retention of characteristics. Anti-human
HO-1 antibody was purchased from R & D Systems
(Abingdon, UK). All other antibodies were obtained from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK). All primers were purchased
from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Micro RNA (miRNA)
vector was cloned on site. Annexin-V and propidium
iodide (PI) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
UK). Cytarabine (dissolved in water, stored at -20 ºC as
a 4.1 mM stock) and daunorubicin (dissolved in water,
stored at -20 ºC as a 0.95 mM stock) were both purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). All other reagents
were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich unless stated.

Cell Culture
Primary AML cells were obtained under local
ethical approval (LREC ref 07/H0310/146). For primary
cell isolation, heparinised blood was collected from
volunteers and isolated by Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO) density gradient centrifugation. U937
were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37ºC with
5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK)
supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Biosera, UK) and 1% L-glutamine incubated. 293FT cells
were obtained from Invitrogen and were grown in DMEM
high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 6
mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and
1 mM sodium pyruvate.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 1 x 106 cells using RNA
lysis solution and a nucleic acid Prepstation both purchased

Virus construction and infection

from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK) following
the manufactures instructions. Applied Biosystems RNA
PCR core kit was used for reverse transcription. SYBR
green technology (Roche) was used on cDNA produced
via the reverse transcription of purified RNA. After
pre-amplification (95 ºC for 2 min) the reactions were
amplified for 45 cycles (95ºC for 15 s, then 60ºC for 10 s,
followed by 72ºC for 10 s) on a Lightcycler 480 (Roche) as
described [29]. HO-1 mRNA expression was standardised
against GAPDH expression using the standard curve
analysis method. Primer sequences were: GAPDH forward
5’-ACCAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGC-3’;
GAPDH
reverse 5’-TGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGC-3’; HO-1
forward 5’-ATGGCCTC CCTGTACCACATC-3’ and
HO-1 reverse 5’-TGTTGCGCTCAATCTCCTCCT-3’.

MicroRNA (miRNA) sequence miRNA-HO-1-166
(5’-TCCTCATGAACTCAGCATTCT-3’)
targeting
human HO-1 was selected with Invitrogen Block-iT
RNAi designer software (www.invitrogen.com/rnai).
pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg
plasmid
from
Invitrogen was used as a source for negative control miRNA
expression. miRNA-encoding viruses were produced with
Block-iT Lentiviral Pol II miRNAi expression system
(Invitrogen) in 293FT cells. Lentiviral stocks were
concentrated using Lenti-XTM concentrator and titers
were determined with Lenti-XTM qRT-PCR titration kit
(both purchased from Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
France). For infection, cells were plated onto 12 well
plates at 2.5 x 105 cells/well and infected with lentiviral
stocks at an MOI of 10 in the presence of polybrene, then
analysed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and Western blotting
48 h post infection. Stably transduced cells were selected
using Blasticidin selection marker (8 μg/ml) for 2 weeks
before use.

Western immunoblotting
Total protein was extracted from 1 x 106 cells
using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as
described [29]. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane, probed according to the antibody
manufacturer’s guidelines and then examined using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection in a Li-Cor
Odyssey IR imaging system.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Student’s T-test was used to assess the statistical
significance compared to that of the control values. Results
with a P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant
and are indicated (*). Values represent the means ±
SEMs from at least three independent experiments, or of
representative blots/plots that are typical of at least three
independent findings.

Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry for measuring apoptosis was
performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Accurri).
Samples were collected, centrifuged at 500 x g, 5 min
then resupended and stained with Annexin-V and PI
dye, followed by detection. N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
antioxidant ROS-scavanger was used to assess the
presence of ROS, whereby cells were treated with NAC
with relevant chemotherapeutic agent for 24 h, prior to
sample flow cytometry analysis.

REFERENCES

Dichlorofluorescein Assay
A dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay was used to
determine cellular ROS generation [21]. Cells were
washed with PBS and then incubated with 10 µM of
2’,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA)
for 15 min at 37 ºC and 5% CO2. Flow cytometry was
used to measure the fluorescence intensity of H2DCFDA.
The mean channel fluorescence of a treated sample is
divided by that of the control and then multiplied by 100,
thus obtaining the relative percentage change. The relative
fluorescence intensity of H2DCFDA detected represents
the steady state of ROS generation [21, 36, 37].
