Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Overcoming metabolic stress is a critical step for solid tumour growth1,2. However, the underlying
mechanisms of cell death and survival under metabolic stress are not well understood. A key
signalling pathway involved in metabolic adaptation is the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway2,3. Energy stress conditions that decrease intracellular
ATP levels below a certain level promote AMPK activation by LKB1. Previous studies showed
that LKB1-deficient or AMPK-deficient cells are resistant to oncogenic transformation and
tumorigenesis4–6, possibly because of the function of AMPK in metabolic adaptation. However,
the mechanisms by which AMPK promotes metabolic adaptation in tumour cells are not fully
understood. Here we show that AMPK activation, during energy stress, prolongs cell survival by
redox regulation. Under these conditions, NADPH generation by the pentose phosphate pathway
is impaired, but AMPK induces alternative routes to maintain NADPH and inhibit cell death. The
inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1 and ACC2 by AMPK maintains NADPH levels
by decreasing NADPH consumption in fatty-acid synthesis and increasing NADPH generation by
means of fatty-acid oxidation. Knockdown of either ACC1 or ACC2 compensates for AMPK
activation and facilitates anchorage-independent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo,
whereas the activation of ACC1 or ACC2 attenuates these processes. Thus AMPK, in addition to
its function in ATP homeostasis, has a key function in NADPH maintenance, which is critical for
cancer cell survival under energy stress conditions, such as glucose limitations, anchorageindependent growth and solid tumour formation in vivo.

The lack of LKB1 or AMPK activation rendered cancer cells more sensitive to cell death
induced by glucose deprivation5,7–9 (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the mechanism by
which the failure to activate AMPK accelerates cancer cell death during energy stress
remains to be explained. Our results demonstrate that the effect of AMPK does not involve
p53 or mTORC1, which were implicated in the LKB1–AMPK-mediated regulation of cell
survival during glucose deprivation8,10. In both control A549 cells (A549-Vect) and
dominant-negative p53 (p53DN)-expressing A549 cells (A549-p53DN), LKB1

reconstitution restored AMPK activation, as measured by ACC phosphorylation, and
inhibited glucose-starvation-induced cell death to a similar extent (Fig. 1a, b). mTORC1
inhibition with rapamycin also did not affect the sensitivity of A549 cells to glucose
deprivation (Fig. 1b).
Replacement of glucose with the non-metabolizable glucose analogues 2-deoxyglucose
(2DG) or 5-thioglucose (5TG) revealed that only 2DG protected LKB1-deficient cancer
cells (A549 and HeLa) from glucose-starvation-induced cell death (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 2b). Unlike 5TG, 2DG strongly induced the activation of AMPK, even
in LKB1-deficient cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). This activation occurred by
means of a poorly understood mechanism that is dependent on hexokinase (Supplementary
Fig. 3). The results suggest that, by activating AMPK, 2DG inhibits cell death during
glucose deprivation. However, LKB1 reconstitution in A549 cells induced higher AMPK
activation than 2DG (Fig. 1a), yet 2DG protected the cells slightly better than LKB1 (Fig.
1b), implying that 2DG could protect cells by both AMPK-dependent and AMPKindependent mechanisms.

Glucose limitations could induce oxidative stress by decreasing NADPH generation in the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Fig. 1c). NADPH is required for the regeneration of
reduced glutathione (GSH), which is used by glutathione peroxidase (GPX) to eliminate
H2O2 (Fig. 1c). We therefore speculated as follows: first, that the failure to activate AMPK
by glucose deprivation accelerates cell death through oxidative stress mediated by decreased
PPP flux and NADPH/GSH generation; second, that AMPK activation under these
conditions is required to inhibit cell death by decreasing oxidative stress; and third, that 2DG
protects the cells by both AMPK activation and partial utilization in the PPP11 (Fig. 1c).
We first established that decreased PPP flux and increased oxidative stress are the cause of
the cell death. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) knockdown accelerated cell
death in low glucose (Fig. 1d) and even in the absence of glucose (Supplementary Fig. 4a,
b). Glucose deprivation rapidly depleted NADPH/GSH and elevated the H2O2 level in
control cells, which were further affected by G6PD knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e).
Finally, the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and catalase inhibited cell death in LKB1deficient or AMPK-deficient cells (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Figs 1c, 5 and 6).

We next examined the function of AMPK in redox regulation by using A549-Vect and
A549-LKB1 cells. Unlike A549-Vect cells, A549-LKB1 cells maintained NADP+/NADPH
and GSSG/GSH ratios and prevented the increase in the H2O2 level during glucose
starvation (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 7). Expression of p53DN showed a faster
depletion of NADPH and increase in H2O2 level (Fig. 1f, g), explaining increased cell death
(Fig. 1e). The superoxide (O2−) level was not increased (Fig. 1h), suggesting that the
increased H2O2 level is due to NADPH depletion and impaired H2O2 detoxification. LKB1
reconstitution neither decreased the O2− level (Fig. 1h) nor changed that of catalase (Fig.
1a), further suggesting that NADPH maintenance is the predominant mechanism by which
AMPK prevents oxidative stress. Consistently, LKB1 or AMPKα1 knockdown in MCF7 or
H1703 cells significantly increased H2O2 levels, but not those of O2−, during glucose
deprivation (Supplementary Fig. 8). Similarly, AMPKα-knockout (AMPKα-KO) murine
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) failed to maintain their NADP+/NADPH ratio and low H2O2
level after glucose starvation (Fig. 1i). Finally, as we had speculated, 2DG maintained
NADPH, GSH and H2O2 levels and protected from cell death largely by means of AMPK
activation and to a smaller extent by partial utilization in the PPP (Supplementary Fig. 4).
This could explain why 2DG protects from cell death slightly better than LKB1 despite
higher activation of AMPK by LKB1 (Fig. 1b). Thus, the combination of decreased NADPH
generation by the PPP and impaired AMPK activation during glucose deprivation in LKB1-

deficient or AMPK-deficient cells accelerates NADPH depletion and H2O2 elevation,
eventually causing cell death.

Next we investigated the mechanism by which AMPK maintains the NADPH level in the
absence of glucose. The intracellular NADPH level is determined by the difference between
its production and its consumption. NADPH is generated from the PPP and mitochondrial
metabolism, and is consumed mainly during H2O2 detoxification by GPX and peroxiredoxin
(PRX) and fatty-acid synthesis (FAS) (Fig. 2a). Under limited glucose supply, the major
NADPH source is mitochondrial metabolism, which is supported by fatty-acid oxidation
(FAO). Metabolites provided by FAO to the tricarboxylic acid cycle generate malate and
citrate, the substrates of NADPH-producing malic enzyme and isocitrate dehydrogenase,
respectively. AMPK regulates fatty-acid metabolism through the phosphorylation and
inhibition of ACC1 and ACC2, which in turn inhibit FAS and activates FAO, respectively12.
Both ACC1 and ACC2 generate malonyl-CoA, the precursor of FAS and a potent inhibitor
of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO13 (Fig. 2a). We
therefore reasoned that AMPK might regulate NADPH homeostasis by inhibiting ACC1 and
ACC2.

We first determined whether targeting ACC1 or ACC2 inhibits cell death, the accumulation
of H2O2 and the depletion of NADPH observed during glucose deprivation. Targeting either
ACC1 or ACC2 in A549 cells by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated that only
ACC2 knockdown significantly inhibited cell death and H2O2 accumulation, without
decreasing O2− (Supplementary Fig. 9). We therefore generated stable cell lines expressing
ACC2-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Supplementary Fig. 10a). ACC2 knockdown in
A549 cells maintained the NADP+/NADPH ratio (Fig. 2b) and the GSSG/GSH ratio (Fig.
2c), inhibited the accumulation of H2O2 (Fig. 2d) and prevented cell death (Fig. 2e). Similar
results were obtained in HeLa, MCF7-LKB1sh and H1703-LKB1sh cells (Supplementary
Fig. 10b–d). Targeting either ACC1 or ACC2 in AMPKα-KO MEFs significantly decreased
the H2O2 level during glucose starvation (Supplementary Fig. 11). The inability of ACC1
knockdown in A549 cells to decrease the H2O2 level during glucose starvation was probably
because FAS inhibition in these cells occurs to a similar extent regardless of LKB1
expression or ACC1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 12). In contrast, A549-LKB1 and
A549-ACC2sh cells showed a marked increase in FAO, explaining why ACC2 knockdown
was able to decrease H2O2 levels but ACC1 knockdown was not (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Consistently, overexpression of the constitutively active ACC2(S212A) mutant significantly
inhibited FAO and sensitized MCF7 cells to glucose-deprivation-mediated cell death, and
partly blocked protection by 2DG in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 13). Furthermore,
short-term exposure to the FAS inhibitor C75, which also activates CPT1, mimicking the
effects of AMPK on fatty-acid metabolism, lowered the NADP+/NADPH ratio and
protected A549 and HeLa cells during glucose deprivation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig.
14a, b). However, because C75 inhibits FAS downstream of ACC1, long-term treatment
with C75 leads to the cytotoxic accumulation of malonyl-CoA14. Indeed, etomoxir, a CPT1
inhibitor, abrogated the short-term effect of C75 without affecting the effect of NAC
(Supplementary Fig. 14c). These results indicate that the short-term protective effect of C75
was largely due to the activation of CPT1 and the acceleration of FAO. Furthermore,
treatment with the ACC inhibitor TOFA protected from cell death, whereas the malate
supplement alone could not (Supplementary Fig. 15a). However, the combination of TOFA
and malate further protected from cell death (Supplementary Fig. 15a). These results suggest
that malate alone is not sufficient to induce NADPH accumulation, because NADPH could
still be consumed by FAS. Thus, when FAS is inhibited by TOFA, malate can promote
sufficient NADPH accumulation to inhibit cell death during glucose deprivation. Finally, the
protective effect of ACC2 knockdown was abrogated by buthionine sulfoximine, which

depletes GSH, but not by nicotinamide (NAM), which inhibits Sirt1, excluding a possible
involvement of the NAD+–Sirt1 pathway15 (Supplementary Fig. 15b).

Like glucose starvation, matrix detachment elicits energy stress followed by elevated H2O2
levels and cell death16. Indeed, matrix detachment inhibited glucose uptake in A549 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 16), and markedly activated AMPK in A549-LKB1 cells (Fig. 3a).
AMPK was also activated in A549 cells but to a much smaller extent than in A549-LKB1
cells (Fig. 3a), which is dependent on calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK;
Fig. 3b). We therefore tested whether AMPK activation is required for redox regulation
during matrix detachment and anchorage-independent growth, which is a hallmark of cancer
cells. Matrix detachment significantly increased the H2O2 level in A549-Vect cells in
comparison with A549-LKB1 cells, regardless of p53 status (Fig. 3c). CaMKK inhibition in
A549 cells further elevated the H2O2 level during matrix detachment (Fig. 3d), supporting a
key function for AMPK in redox regulation during this process. The results were confirmed
in MCF7 cells with LKB1 knockdown or AMPKα1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 17).
The impaired AMPK activation and the higher H2O2 level in matrix-detached A549 cells
were correlated to the extent of NADPH depletion (Fig. 3e). The high NADP+/NADPH ratio
in A549 cells was further increased after matrix detachment, whereas the low NADP+/
NADPH ratio was maintained in A549-LKB1 cells (Fig. 3e).

We next investigated whether ACCs mediate the effect of AMPK during matrix detachment.
Knockdown of ACC1 by siRNA, but not that of ACC2, blocked the increase in the H2O2
level by matrix detachment (Supplementary Fig. 18). We therefore used A549 cells
expressing ACC1-specific shRNA (Supplementary Fig. 19) and confirmed that ACC1
knockdown markedly decreased the NADP+/NADPH ratio and H2O2 level (Fig. 3f, g).
Finally, the ACC inhibitor TOFA, but not the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, decreased the
H2O2 level (Supplementary Fig. 20). LKB1 expression had a more pronounced effect on
FAS inhibition than on FAO increase (Supplementary Fig. 21a). This effect was
recapitulated by ACC1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 21b), explaining why ACC1
knockdown could decrease the H2O2 level.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We then assessed whether redox regulation by ACCs has a function in anchorageindependent growth. Consistent with previous observations16, we found that treatment of
A549 cells and AMPKα-KO-RasV12 MEFs with NAC substantially increased the number of
colonies (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 22). Inhibition of CaMKK markedly inhibited
anchorage-independent growth, which was rescued by NAC treatment (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 22a). Targeting either ACC1 or ACC2 substantially increased the
number of colonies on soft agar and recapitulated the effect of NAC (Fig. 4b, c and
Supplementary Fig. 23). However, the average colony size was increased only by ACC1
knockdown (Fig. 4b, c), which may reflect the predominant function of ACC1 in controlling
the H2O2 level after matrix detachment.
To assess further the function of ACCs in anchorage-independent growth, we overexpressed
the ACC1(S79A) and ACC2(S212A) mutants in two LKB1-proficient cell lines, MCF7 and
H1703. Both mutants increased FAS and the H2O2 level after matrix detachment (Fig. 4d
and Supplementary Fig. 24a), and potently inhibited anchorage-independent growth, which
was partly rescued by NAC (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 24b, c). These results indicate
that the inhibition of either ACC1 or ACC2 by AMPK is required for anchorageindependent growth by means of redox regulation. In contrast, ACC1 knockdown or ACC2
knockdown in LKB1-reconstituted HeLa cells inhibited anchorage-independent growth
(Supplementary Fig. 25a). Thus, when AMPK is activated, further inhibition of ACC1 or
ACC2 could not enhance tumorigenesis, instead attenuating it.

During the formation of a solid tumour, cells undergo metabolic stress including glucose
deprivation and matrix detachment. Indeed, it has been shown that AMPKα-KO-RasV12
MEFs are severely impaired in their ability to form tumours in vivo6 and that AMPK is
activated during the early stages of solid tumour formation17. Thus, to determine whether
ACCs have a function in solid tumour formation in vivo, we performed xenograft assays
using A549 and AMPKα-KO-RasV12 MEFs expressing shRNAs targeting ACC1 or ACC2.
Knockdown of ACC1 or ACC2 significantly enhanced tumour formation in vivo (Fig. 4f, g);
the latter had a more pronounced effect on tumour growth than the former. However, neither
ACC1 knockdown or ACC2 knockdown in A549-LKB1 cells had much effect on tumour
growth (Supplementary Fig. 25b), further suggesting that physiological inhibition of ACC
by AMPK, but not enhanced inhibition, is required to promote solid tumour growth. To
assess these results further, we performed orthotopic transplantation using MCF7 cells. The
knockdown of either LKB1 or AMPKα1 in MCF7 cells significantly inhibited orthotopic
tumour growth (Supplementary Fig. 26a). To test the function of ACC1 and ACC2
phosphorylation by AMPK in tumour growth, MCF7 cells expressing either ACC1(S79A)
or ACC2(S212A) were subjected to orthotopic transplantation. Consistent with the in vitro
results (Fig. 4e), ACC2(S212A) expression significantly inhibited solid tumour growth;
ACC1(S79A) expression also inhibited tumour growth, although to a smaller extent, under
two different experimental conditions (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 26b). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that NADPH maintenance through AMPK–ACC1/ACC2 is critical
for solid tumour growth in vivo (Fig. 4i). It was previously reported that ACC2 expression is
significantly downregulated in papillary thyroid cancer18, supporting a tumour-suppressor
function for ACC2 in certain contexts. Moreover, consistent with our results, it was shown
that overexpression of CPT1 promotes solid tumour growth through the activation of
FAO19.

Our results are not inconsistent with results showing that inhibition of FAS by the
knockdown of fatty acid synthase (FASN) or ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibits
tumorigenesis20,21 because, unlike the inhibition of ACC, the inhibition of FASN or ACLY
exerts additional cytotoxic effects. These cytotoxic effects seem to be through the
accumulation of malonyl-CoA but not through the direct inhibition of FAS itself14,22,23, and
through the inhibition of acetylation without decreasing lipid contents24,25. Our results seem
paradoxical because of the tumour suppressor activity of LKB1–AMPK, partly through
mTORC1 inhibition3. We propose that during glucose limitations or matrix depletion,
AMPK activation, at physiological levels, is required for NADPH homeostasis, which
surpasses the requirement for mTORC1 activity. Combating energy stress conditions by
AMPK is particularly important in the early stages of solid tumour formation when cells
migrate to the lumen, or during metastasis when cells migrate from the primary tumour to a
different location. However, AMPK activation is probably occurring in a temporal manner,
because FAO could also increase the ATP level (Supplementary Fig. 27), which would
eventually inhibit AMPK. Our results therefore do not necessarily contradict the possibility
that prolonged and robust AMPK activation inhibits cancer cell proliferation. In fact, they
suggest that a combination of metabolic inhibitors, such as 2DG or metformin, and ACC
activators could synergistically decrease cancer cell survival by concurrently inhibiting
mTORC1 and the pro-survival activity of AMPK. This combination could be more effective
in LKB1-null cancer cells.
Our findings could explain why AMPK-deficient cells are resistant to oncogenic
transformation4,6. At the organismal level our results may explain why patients with Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome, who have an inherited deficiency of LKB1, and most mouse models of
LKB1 deficiency develop only benign tumours4. Although somatic mutations in LKB1 are
rare in most cancers, the mutations are prevalent in certain cancers, such as non-small cell
lung carcinoma and cervical carcinoma3. In mouse models, deficiency in LKB1 also

promotes Ras-induced lung tumorigenesis26. One possible explanation is that certain
microenvironmental factors may enable AMPK activation in the absence of LKB1 through
other upstream activators, such as CaMKK, as shown in Fig. 3b. In addition, LKB1
deficiency may affect other multiple downstream effectors of LKB1 (ref. 26) that could
circumvent the requirement for the LKB1–AMPK pathway during the early stages of solid
tumour formation.
AMPK is known to maintain intracellular ATP level under conditions of energy stress.
Consistently, we found that AMPK maintains ATP level in addition to NADPH level under
these conditions (Supplementary Fig. 27a). However, NAC, which protected from cell
death, did not restore ATP level during glucose starvation (Supplementary Fig. 27b),
indicating that NADPH maintenance rather than ATP maintenance is the predominant
mechanism by which AMPK promotes cell survival during metabolic stress (Fig. 4j).
Our study shows that under conditions of energy stress, when NADPH generation from the
PPP is impaired, AMPK activation is required for the maintenance of NADPH level by
inhibiting ACC1 and/or ACC2 (Fig. 4i, j). This function of AMPK is critical for cancer cell
survival during metabolic stress, which can occur in the solid tumour microenvironment.

Cell death assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In most of the experiments, apoptotic cell death was measured by using DAPI staining, as
described previously27,31. Cells were plated at a low density ((0.7–1) × 105 cells per well in
a 12-well plate); on the next day, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured in glucosefree medium supplemented with dialysed FBS. At each time point, the cells were fixed by
the direct addition of formaldehyde (final concentration 12%) to the culture medium. After
overnight fixation, the cells were stained for 5 min with DAPI (1 µg ml−1), and then left in
PBS. The cells were detected with fluorescence microscopy, and cells with condensed and/
or fragmented chromatin indicative of apoptosis were counted as dead cells. For MCF7
cells, a trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to measure cell death.
Assays of reactive oxygen species
The intracellular levels of H2O2 and O2− were measured with DCF and DHE, respectively.
Cells (105) were plated in a 12-well plate and treated with DCF or DHE for 30 min. The
cells were then washed with PBS and collected as single-cell suspensions. Fluorescence was
detected by flow cytometry.

The intracellular levels of NADPH and total NADP (NADPH+NADP+) were measured with
previously described enzymatic cycling methods, with modifications32,33. In brief, 1.8 × 106
cells were plated in 10-cm dishes; on the next day, the cells were lysed in 400 µl of
extraction buffer (20 mM nicotinamide, 20 mM NaHCO3, 100 mM Na2CO3) and
centrifuged. For NADPH extraction, 150 µl of the supernatant was incubated at 60 °C for 30
min. Next, 160 µl of NADP-cycling buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM thiazolyl
blue, 2 mM phenazine ethosulfate, 5 mM EDTA) containing 1.3U of G6PD was added to a

°C, 20 µl of 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) was added to the mixture, and the change in
absorbance at 570 nm was measured every 30 s for 4 min at 30 °C with a microplate reader.
The concentration of NADP+ was calculated by subtracting[NADPH] from [total NADP].
The intracellular levels of GSH and total glutathione (GSSG + GSH) were measured with
the use of enzymatic cycling methods, as described previously34. The intracellular level of

cells were seeded in a 12-well plate for 1 day. For the glucose starvation experiments, the
cells were incubated in glucose-free medium for 2 h, and either [3H]acetate (for FAS) or
[9,10-3H]palmitate (for FAO) was added for a further 3 h. For matrix detachment, 105 cells
were seeded on poly-HEMA-coated 12-well plates for 2 h, and either [3H]acetate or
[9,10-3H]palmitate was added for a further 3 h. For the measurement of FAS, total lipids
were extracted from [3H]acetate-treated cells with chloroform/methanol. For the
measurement of FAO, the medium from [9,10-3H]palmitate-treated cells was collected to
recover 3H2O using Dowex 1X8-200 columns. 3H-labelled lipids and water were quantified
by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose uptake was measured with 2-deoxy[3H]glucose.
Soft-agar assay
A total of 3 × 104 cells were suspended in DMEM (10% FBS, 5 mM glucose) containing
0.35% agarose and layered on solidified medium containing 0.7% agarose in six-well plates.
For MCF7 cells, 1 mM sodium pyruvate was added to the medium. After solidification, the
top layer was covered with the medium. When necessary, 2 mM NAC or 5 µg ml−1
STO-609 was added to each layer and the cover medium. The medium was replaced every
week. Images were taken after 3–4 weeks and analysed with ImageJ software.
Xenograft assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Male and female athymic nude mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. A549 cells (2 × 106 per 0.1 ml of PBS) or AMPKα-KO-MEFs-RasV12 cells (5
× 106 per 0.1 ml of PBS) expressing the LacZ-specific, ACC1-specific or ACC2-specific
shRNA were injected subcutaneously into both the left and right flanks of each mouse. A
xenograft assay using A549 cells was performed twice. MCF7 cells were injected
orthotopically into the mammary fat pads (two positions per mouse) in two different
conditions, namely the absence (Supplementary Fig. 25) and presence (Fig. 4g) of 10%
Matrigel in cell suspensions. Before injection, 17β-oestradiol pellets (1.7 mg/pelleted, 60day release; Innovative Research of America) were implanted in each mouse. The tumour
size was measured every week, and the tumour volume was calculated with the equation V
(in mm3) = a × b2/2, where a is the longest diameter and b is the shortest diameter. When the
tumour size reached the end-point criterion (a diameter greater than 2 cm), the mouse was
killed. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the animal care policies
