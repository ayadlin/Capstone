BACKGROUND: In the medical literature many analyses of outcomes of sarcoma patients were performed without regard to the problem of “competing risks.” METHODS: We analyzed local relapse–free and metastasis-free survival in a population of 3255 adult
patients with a primary soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) included in the French Sarcoma Group database. Cumulative incidence of local and
metastatic relapse was estimated by accounting for death as a competing event. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, age, tumor site,
histological subtype, and grade were independent adverse prognostic factors for local relapse, whereas tumor depth and size had no
influence. Histological subtype, tumor depth, tumor size, and grade were independent adverse prognostic factors for metastatic
relapse. Despite a higher incidence of competing deaths in patients managed with adjuvant radiotherapy than in patients not receiving radiotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with a significant benefit in terms of local relapse–free survival. Despite a similar cumulative incidence of competing deaths in patients with grade 2 and grade 3 disease, we found that the benefit of adjuvant
chemotherapy was present only in patients with grade 3 and not in patients with grade 2 disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of
competing risks, tumor biology reflected by histological grade is a crucial predictor of local relapse, whereas tumor depth and size
have poor if any influence. Grade could also predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with STS. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Prognostication is of crucial importance in cancer patients. Indeed, an accurate prediction of local or metastatic relapse
and of overall survival will help clinicians to plan specific care and follow-up strategies according to the specific risks of
their own patients.
Statistical methods for analyzing time-to-event data such as Kaplan-Meier curves, the log rank test, hazard ratios, and
the Cox proportional hazard model are widely used in the medical literature. These methods evaluate time to a specific event
with data that are often subject to censored observations. For instance, to determine time to local relapse, every patient is followed from the date of local treatment until the date of local relapse or study final date. However, with the above methods,
patients who first develop metastatic disease or die before local relapse are considered censored for time to local relapse. Such
events (metastatic relapse or death) are typically called “competing risks.”1-3 In fact, the main limit of actuarial methods cited
above is that they are based on the assumption that “competing risks” are independent. For most cancers, such an assumption
does not make sense. Indeed, the occurrence of a competing risk (for instance, death by suicide or by metastatic disease) may
preclude the onset of the event of interest (for instance, local relapse) or at least modify its probability.1-3

Soft-tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous
group of rare tumors accounting for about 1% of cancers
in adults.4,5 Surgery represents the cornerstone of treatment for patients with localized disease. Despite adequate
locoregional treatment, 10%-30% and 35%-40% of
patients will develop local relapse and metastatic disease,
respectively. Isolated local relapse may lead to patient
death even in the absence of metastatic disease, particularly when the primary tumor is retroperitoneal. In contrast, high-grade tumors are associated with a risk of early
metastatic relapse leading to patient death and as a consequence minimizing the risk of local failure.6,7
The role of adjuvant treatments such as radiation
therapy and chemotherapy is controversial. Indeed,
because of their rarity, data from randomized trials assessing the role of adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy are scarce and the level of evidence poor. Although
adjuvant radiation therapy is considered standard treat3362

ment in high-grade deep lesions, >5 cm, its role is more
controversial in low-grade or <5-cm lesions.8,9 Moreover,
although adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to
improve metastasis-free survival, its impact on overall survival has not been demonstrated.10 Several studies aimed
to refine the prognosis of soft-tissue sarcomas to help
clinicians to more accurately select patients for adjuvant
treatments.2-17 For all these studies, survival analysis was
performed for each event type (local relapse, metastatic
relapse, or death) separately, whereas the other (competing) event types were treated as censored categories. This
approach may substantially overestimate the absolute risk
of the event of interest because subjects with a competing
(and thus censored) event are treated as if they could experience the event of interest in the future. The aim of this
study was to use a competing risk model for the definition
of prognostic factors for local and metastatic relapse in
soft-tissue sarcomas and the assessment of the impact of
adjuvant treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

From 1990 to 2010, 3255 nonpediatric patients (16
years old) with a nonmetastatic soft-tissue sarcoma underwent R0 or R1 surgery of the primary tumor and were
included in the French Sarcoma Group (GSF) database.
Patient with tumors of intermediate malignancy (dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans) or with Ewing or alveolar/
embryonal rhabodmyosarcoma were excluded. All the
cases were reviewed by the members of the pathological
subcommittee of the GSF. Histological diagnosis was
established according to the World Health Organization
Classification of Tumors.4 Histological grade was determined after central review as previously described according to the Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte
Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC) grading system.7,18 The
patients’ characteristics are described in Table 1. Nineteen
hundred fifty-nine patients (60.2%) received adjuvant
radiotherapy (median dose, 50.4 Gy). Seven hundred
twenty-four (22.3%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. In
all the cases, doxorubicin was delivered either alone or in
combination with other drugs (dacarbazine with or without cyclophosphamide and vincristine; CYVADIC protocol, or ifosfamide with or without dacarbazine and mesna;
AI or MAID protocols).
Statistical Analysis

(LRFS) and metastatic relapse–free survival (MRFS).
LRFS was defined as the interval between histological diagnosis and the time of local recurrence or the last followup. MRFS was defined as the interval between histological
diagnosis and the time of distant recurrence or the last
follow-up. Competing risk was death from all causes in
the analyses of LRFS and MRFS. The LRFS and MRFS
were described using cumulative incidence rates with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).
The cumulative incidence function is the cumulative
probability of failure from a specific cause over time and is
particularly useful in the presence of competing risks. The
effect of covariates on failure time can be assessed using
regression analysis based directly on the cumulative incidence function using, for example, the method introduced by Fine and Gray.19 Details regarding this
approach have already been described.20,21
Following this approach, the possible prognostic factors were analyzed using a proportional hazard model,
estimating subhazard ratios (sHRs) with 95% CIs both
univariately and multivariately. Univariate analysis
included the following variables: age, sex, anatomic site,
tumor size, tumor location (superficial or deep), margin
status, presence of bone or neurovascular invasion, histological subtype, and FNCLCC grade. Significant factors
(P < .05) were included in a multivariate model and
selected in a descending process. The final model was
adjusted on treatment. Median follow-up was determined
using the reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator.22 Analyses
were performed using Stata statistical software, version
11.2.
RESULTS
The median follow-up of patients was 4.5 years (95% CI,
4.3-4.7 years).
Local Relapse–Free Survival (LRFS)

At the time of analysis, 737 patients (22.6%) had local
recurrence. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year cumulative
incidence of local relapse was 6.5% (95% CI,
5.6%-7.3%), 26.1% (95% CI, 24.2%-27.6%), and
31.5% (95% CI, 29.3%-33.5%), respectively (Fig. 1).
On multivariate analysis, age, tumor site, histological
subtype, and grade were independent adverse prognostic
factors for LRFS (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Impact of Adjuvant Radiotherapy

The incidence of competing deaths was higher in patients
managed with adjuvant radiotherapy than in patients not
receiving radiotherapy. Despite this, adjuvant radiotherCancer

apy was associated with a significant benefit in local
relapse–free survival, with an overall sHR of 0.52 (95%
CI, 0.44-0.61; P < .001) after adjustment for other prognostic factors in competing settings.
Metastasis-Free Survival

At the time of analysis, 754 patients (23.2%) had metastatic relapse. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year cumulative
incidence of metastatic relapse was 7.5% (95% CI, 6.5%8.3%), 26.8% (95% CI, 25.2%-28.7%), and 32.0%
(95% CI, 29.9%-34.1%), respectively (Fig. 3). On multivariate analysis, histological subtype, tumor location, tumor size, and grade were independent adverse prognostic
factors for metastasis-free survival (Table 2, Fig. 3).
Impact of Adjuvant Chemotherapy

On multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was
associated with a significant benefit metastasis-free survival, with an overall sHR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.57-0.86;
P 5 .001) after adjustment for other prognostic factors.
Because we have previously reported that the benefit of
adjuvant chemotherapy was limited to patient with grade
3 disease, we performed an analysis by grade. Despite a
similar cumulative incidence of competing deaths in
patients with grade 2 and grade 3 disease, we found that
the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was present only in
patients with grade 3 (sHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45-0.73;
P < .001) and not in patients with grade 2 disease (sHR,
1.06; 95% CI, 0.74-1.54; P 5 .436) after adjustment for
other prognostic factors in competing settings (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
In the presence of competing events, the Kaplan-Meier
method generally overestimates the risk of the event of interest.1-3 Therefore, the cumulative incidence of metastatic relapse accounting for competing risk as reported in
the results section above is a more accurate estimation of
the risk of metastatic relapse than the risk estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method. This also appears obvious when
comparing the risk of an event in different categories of a
specific variable. In fact, the risk of a competing event
may not be identical in categories of the same variable.
For instance, as shown in the results section, patients with
a deep tumor or a tumor >5 cm were at a higher risk of
competing death than patients with a superficial or a
small-size tumor. This may be explained by the finding
that patients with deep and/or large tumors have a higher
risk of metastatic relapse and death from disease, which is
in keeping with previous reports.6-8,13-16.This may
explain why deep location and tumor size were not

identified as independent prognostic factors for local
relapse in our series. In regard to the other prognostic factors of local relapse, the majority of them were in agreement with those of previous reports.6,8,13-16 However, we
also found that despite a higher incidence of competing
deaths for patients with high-grade tumors, distinctions
between low-grade and high-grade tumors may help to
identify patients who are at higher risk of local relapse.
These findings are not in agreement with a recent study
3364

that analyzed the risk of local relapse of soft-tissue sarcoma
(STS) in the setting of competitive risks.23 However, that
study also included patients with recurrent disease at presentation, which may have biased the interpretation of the
results. Adjuvant radiotherapy is considered standard
treatment in high-grade, deep lesions >5 cm.10 Indeed,
these characteristics have been identified as prognostic factors for local relapse in several series using actuarial statistical methods.6,12-16 Adjuvant radiotherapy is also

recommended for high-grade, deep, <5-cm tumors,
whereas it remains only an option for deep-seated lowgrade tumors. Our results clearly confirm the higher risk
of recurrence of high-grade lesions based on competing
risks models. However as discussed above, we did not find
any prognostic impact of tumor size and tumor location
(deep or superficial). Altogether, these data suggest that
the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy depends mainly on
the biological characteristics of the tumor and its intrinsic
risk of life-threatening metastatic relapse rather than its
deep or superficial location or size.
Prognostic factors for metastatic relapse identified in
our study are similar to those reported previously.6,8,13-16
The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in soft-tissue sarcomas
is a matter of debate. A 1997 individual patient metaanalysis of all known randomized clinical data failed to

show a significant benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in
terms of overall survival (OS).24 A more recent metaanalysis including the published data of 4 additional trials
published from 2000 to 2002 recently reported that adjuvant chemotherapy was actually associated with a significant benefit in terms of OS, with a hazard ratio (HR) of
0.77 and an absolute risk reduction of death of 6%.25
These results have been contradicted by the report of a
randomized trial by the European Organisation for
Research and Treatment of Cancer group, which was not
included in the more recent meta-analysis and which has
failed to demonstrate any benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.26 The apparent lack of benefit of chemotherapy in
localized soft-tissue sarcomas may be because many trials
have included heterogeneous types of sarcomas with different biological characteristics and clinical outcomes.24,25

Figure 4. Cumulative incidences of metastatic relapse and related competing deaths in grade 2 (A) and grade 3 (B) patients.

We recently reported a large cohort-based analysis including 1513 patients with 9-year follow-up suggesting that
FNCLCC grade 3 but not grade 2 was predictive of a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.27 None of the adjuvant
retrospective or prospective studies as well as the metaanalyses were analyzed in the competitive risk settings.
Indeed, the aim of chemotherapy is to reduce the risk of
metastatic relapse. However, a significant proportion of
patients die of disease without metastatic recurrence, particularly patients with retroperitoneal tumors, which are
associated with an important risk of local recurrence whatever their grade. Our present results indicate that the differences we observed in chemotherapy benefit between
grade 2 and grade 3 patients were not related to differen3368

ces in competing risk of death but more likely to disease
biology. Altogether, these data suggest that it is unlikely
that future clinical trials in the adjuvant setting would
show a benefit in metastasis-free and overall survival in
STS patients if their design is not improved to include a
more homogenous population in terms of metastatic risk.
Overall, our results suggest that in the setting of
competing risks, tumor biology reflected by histological
grade is a crucial predictor of local relapse, whereas tumor
depth and size have poor if any influence. Grade could
also predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in
patients with STS. Overall, these data should be considered to tailor the indications and choice of adjuvant treatments in STS patients.
