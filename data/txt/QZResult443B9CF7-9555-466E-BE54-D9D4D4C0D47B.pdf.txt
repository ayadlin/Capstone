Abstract
Activated in response to chemotherapy, senescence is a tumor suppressive
mechanism that induces a permanent loss of proliferation. However, in response to
treatment, it is not really known how cells can escape senescence and how irreversible
or incomplete this pathway is. We have recently described that cells that escape
senescence are more transformed than non-treated parental cells, they resist anoikis
and rely on Mcl-1. In this study, we further characterize this emergence in response
to irinotecan, a first line treatment used in colorectal cancer. Our results indicate
that Akt was activated as a feedback pathway during the early step of senescence.
The inhibition of the kinase prevented cell emergence and improved treatment
efficacy, both in vitro and in vivo. This improvement was correlated with senescence
inhibition, p21waf1 downregulation and a concomitant activation of apoptosis due
to Noxa upregulation and Mcl-1 inactivation. The inactivation of Noxa prevented
apoptosis and increased the number of emergent cells. Using either RNA interference
or p21waf1-deficient cells, we further confirmed that an intact p53-p21-senescence
pathway favored cell emergence and that its downregulation improved treatment
efficacy through apoptosis induction. Therefore, although senescence is an efficient
suppressive mechanism, it also generates more aggressive cells as a consequence
of apoptosis inhibition. We therefore propose that senescence-inducing therapies
should be used sequentially with drugs favoring cell death such as Akt inhibitors.
This should reduce cell emergence and tumor relapse through a combined induction
of senescence and apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

heterochromatin formation [3]. It has been shown that
efficient tumor suppression relies on senescent cells
being cleared by immune cells [4-6]. However, it should
be noted that human naevi expressing the Raf oncogene
remain senescent for years [7]. Thus, immune clearance
might not be a common feature of this suppressive
pathway.
Although they are arrested, senescent cells are not
inactive since they produce soluble factors known as the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [810]. The activity of the SASP is complex; depending on
the experimental conditions, it has either a suppressive
[10, 11] or an oncogenic function [12-14]. Thus, contrary
to apoptosis, senescence can generate cells that can

Activated in response to chemotherapy treatments,
the p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways induce apoptosis or
senescence to prevent cancer cell proliferation. Apoptosis
relies on the direct or indirect activation of the Bax/
Bak pro-apoptotic proteins by BH3-only regulators
such as Noxa, Bim or Puma and the consequent caspase
induction and cell death. Conversely, senescent cells are
viable but their replicative potential is lost as a result of
cell cycle arrest and concomitant activation of the mTor
pathway [1, 2]. This suppression relies on p21waf1 and
p16INK4 activation and on the permanent inhibition
of E2F-responsive genes through Rb activation and

potentially alter the microenvironment, and maybe in
some cases allow auto or paracrine tumor escape. As
compared to apoptosis, these observations have led authors
to question the efficacy of senescence as a complete tumor
suppressive mechanism [15]. Illustrating this hypothesis,
it has been recently reported that in mice models, p53mediated senescence induced the failure of doxorubicin
treatment [16]. This was related to the inhibition of mitotic
catastrophy and apoptosis by the senescence-mediated
arrest. Thus, the question of whether senescence and
apoptosis elicit an equivalent level of tumor suppression
is an important issue that needs to be clarified.
We have recently shown that cells can adapt to
senescence and escape as a dividing population, either
during oncogene-induced senescence [17] or following
chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS) [18-20].
Importantly, cells that resist CIS grow in low adhesion
conditions, invade a matrigel matrix and form tumors in
vivo [18]. We have proposed that more aggressive cells
exit this suppressive pathway, either because senescence
was not complete or because of a phenotypic switch that
reconstitutes a dividing population. Interestingly, these
cells show dependency on the Mcl-1 pro-survival protein.
Its depletion increased treatment efficacy and prevented
cell emergence, indicating that apoptosis effectively
improves treatment efficacy in comparison to senescence.
In the current study, we pursued these experiments
on the characterization of CIS escape, with the aim of
finding combination therapies that would prevent cell
emergence. Irinotecan is a well-known topoisomerase
I inhibitor used as a first line treatment in colorectal
cancer. Unfortunately cancer cells escape rapidly [21],
requiring second line treatments and targeted therapies
to increase the time to progression [22]. Among several
resistance mechanisms, compensatory feedback pathways
play an essential role in enabling cell escape in response
to targeted therapies [23-27]. To our knowledge, this
remains to be described in the context of irinotecan
treatment and CIS escape. In this study, we describe
that the Akt kinase is activated during CIS and that its
inactivation significantly enhanced irinotecan efficacy
and prevented cell emergence. It is significant to note
that this was explained by the inactivation of senescence
and the concomitant activation of apoptosis. Irinotecan
normaly induces CIS through p21waf1 expression, but Akt
inhibition downregulated this pathway, leading instead to
the activation of the Noxa pro-apoptotic protein, followed
by its binding to Mcl-1 and the consequent induction of
apoptosis. Using p21waf1 -/- cells, we observed more
generally that the presence of an intact senescence
pathway favored cell emergence which was significantly
reduced when apoptosis was induced.
Therefore, although chemotherapy killed off the vast
majority of colorectal cancer cells, some subpopulations
survived this treatment to proliferate as more aggressive
cells. We propose that Akt targeting should be considered
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the future to reduce senescence and improve the
treatment of irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers
through enhanced apoptosis.

RESULTS
Sn38 triggers senescence and activates Akt
Firstly, we confirmed our previous observations
[18, 28], showing that sn38, the active metabolite of
irinotecan, prevents the proliferation of colorectal cell
lines and induces senescence and p21waf1 expression.
Clonogenic assays performed on two different colorectal
cell lines, LS174T and HCT116, confirmed that the
number of colonies was reduced after treatment with sn38
(Figure 1A). Using western blot analysis, we observed
an increase in p21waf1 expression after 48-72 hours of
treatment (Figure 1B, lanes 1-6). Using β-galactosidase
staining, a known marker of senescence, results indicated
that approximately 70% of HCT116 and LS174T cells
had entered senescence after 3 days (Figure 1B, lanes
7-10). Importantly, no signs of apoptosis were detected,
analysing either caspase 3 activation or the presence of
subG1 cells by flow cytometry (see below Figure 7).
Recent studies have shown that Akt signaling
is used as a feedback survival pathway in response to
targeted therapies [25, 27, 29]. Since this remains largely
uncharacterized in response to irinotecan, we then
determined whether this kinase was activated in response
to sn38. Results presented Figure 1C and 1D indicate that
Akt was phosphorylated on its threonine 308 and serine
473 residues in both HCT116 and LS174T cells. This
active state was detected early, during the first 24 hours
of treatment.
Altogether, we concluded from these results that the
Akt kinase was activated in response to sn38 during the
early stage of senescence induction.

Akt inhibition enhances sn38 efficacy
Since Akt was activated in response to sn38, we
used selective inhibitors of the kinase to determine
whether its inactivation could improve the efficacy of
the topoisomerase inhibitor. To this end we first used
GSK690693, which has been described recently as a
specific ATP-competitive inhibitor of the kinase [30].
Using a panel of representative colorectal cell lines and
clonogenic assays, we observed that the sensitivity varied,
depending on the cell type (Figure 2A). For example,
LS174T cells were sensitive to GSK690693 with a
low IC50 of 250 nM whereas HCT116 cells were more
resistant with an IC50 closer to 7700 nM (an equivalent
high IC50 was obtained in ref [30] using short time
proliferation assays. See the material and methods section

for a description of the doses and survival assays used in
this study). Using these two representative cell lines, we
then determined whether GSK690693 effectively blocked
Akt signaling following sn38 treatment. To this end, cells
were treated with sn38, GSK690693 or both and GSK3β
phosphorylation was analyzed since this protein is one of
the main targets of Akt. The results presented in Figure
2B show a decreased GSK3β phosphorylation, confirming
Akt inhibition (note the increase of Akt phosphorylation
detected following GSK690693 treatment, lanes 3 and
7-8. This has been previously reported in [30]). We then
determined whether this inhibitor could improve the
efficacy of sn38. Firstly, we used clonogenic assays to
evaluate long term cell death/arrest, by treating the cells
with sn38 with or without GSK690693 added at the same
time. As shown in Figure 2C (compare lanes 2 and 4; 8 and
10), the treatment with both drugs significantly decreased
the percentage of clones in HCT116 and LS174T cells.
This observation was confirmed using MTT assays (Figure
2D, compare lanes 2 and 4; 8 and 10). In addition, the
same effect was also observed with Akti 1/2, a non-ATPcompetitive and PH-domain dependent Akt inhibitor
(Figure 2C and 2D, compare lanes 2 and 6, 8 and 12). Note
that MTT assays give information on cell division but also
on cell viability and growth. Given the importance of Akt/
mTor on these different pathways, further experiments are
necessary to interpret completly these MTT results.
Altogether, these results show that the
pharmacological inhibition of Akt potentiates the effect
of sn38.

as evidenced by a high KI-67 staining (FSC: Forwardscattered light, proportional to cell-surface area or size,
SSC: Side-scattered light, proportional to cell granularity).
By contrast a high FSC/SSC profile was associated with
the absence of KI-67 expression. We have previously
shown that this subpopulation was mainly composed of
PLS senescent cells [18].
This model of sn38 escape was used to determine
whether Akt was implicated in the emergence of PLD
cells. Using intracellular flow cytometry staining, we
observed that around 25% of dividing PLD express the
Ser473 phosphorylated form of Akt. By contrast the
kinase was almost not activated in the non-dividing PLS
subpopulation (Figure 3C). This difference was confirmed
by western blot, using cell sorting and extracts obtained
from the PLD or PLS subpopulations. The active form
of Akt was mainly detected in the PLD as compared to
the senescent PLS cells (Figure 3D). This activation of
Akt in the PLD subpopulation suggested to us that the
kinase could play a role in the re-activation of cell division
during emergence. To test this hypothesis, we blocked Akt
activation at various points in time using GSK690693. The
drug was added either at the same time as sn38 (condition
1, Figure 3E), or at the time of release in 10% serum
(condition 2, Figure 3E). Results presented in Figure
3F indicate that Akt inhibition significantly limited the
emergence of clones detected by crystal violet staining
after 7-10 days. Using KI67 staining, we found that
this led to a significant reduction of PLD KI67-positive
cells (Figure 3G). We then determined if Akt was able to
modify the proportion of PLS and PLD cells at the end
of emergence. To avoid potential artefacts due to DNA
transfection following cell sorting, we generated PLC
and then stimulated the cells with insulin, a well known
activator of Akt (see protocol Figure 4A). Western blot
experiments confirmed that the kinase was phosphorylated
in this condition (Figure 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2,
lanes 3-4 correspond to a higher exposition to show the
activation of the kinase in PLC, lane 3). Interestingly,
insulin induced a significant increase in the number of
dividing clones after 72 hr. This effect was blocked by
GSK690693, confirming the role of the kinase in the
generation of emergent cells (Figure 4C, compare lanes
2 and 4). As expected, GSK690693 used alone reduced
the number of PLD (Figure 4C, compare lanes 1 and
3). To extend these observations, we then asked if Akt
inhibition prevents the growth of PLC in vivo. To this end,
PLC were generated and then injected subcutaneously
into immunocompromised mice. Starting at day 4, mice
were treated or not with GSK690693 (10mg/kg, 5 days
per week for 4 weeks). The results presented in Figure
4D indicate that the Akt inhibitor was able to significantly
reduce tumor formation by PLC in vivo.
Overall, we concluded from these results that the
pharmacological inhibition of Akt reduced cell emergence
and senescence escape in response to sn38.

Akt inhibition prevents cell emergence and
treatment escape
We have recently described that subpopulations of
colorectal cells can adapt to senescence and chemotherapy
and resume proliferation [18-20, 31]. Escape to sn38 leads
to the emergence of more transformed cells that we have
named PLC (Persistent LS174T Cells, see Figure 3A).
These emergent cells are more aggressive than parental
cells, they induce tumor formation in mice, grow in low
adhesion conditions and resist anoikis [18]. The PLC
population is heterogeneous and composed of around
60-70% senescent cells (named PLS) and 30-40% of
proliferating cells (named PLD). Representative images
presented in Figure 3A describe both this emergence and
PLC heterogeneity. Illustrative ß-galactosidase staining of
the two sub-populations is shown on the right of Figure 3A
(note the presence of PLD proliferating subclones in the
middle of the arrested PLS cells). Using flow cytometry
analysis and cell sorting, we have described that we can
identify the PLD sub-population within the PLC according
to a low size and granularity profile and a high KI-67
staining [18]. Results presented Figure 3B confirmed
that cells with a low FSC/SSC profile divided efficiently

Akt inhibition prevents p21waf1 and senescence
induction

The presence of p21waf1 is necessary for cell
emergence in response to sn38

Since Akt inhibition prevented cell emergence,
we then asked whether this was related to the regulation
of senescence. We firstly used β-galactosidase staining
to test this hypothesis and we observed that sn38mediated senescence was significantly reduced when
Akt was inactivated. This result was obtained with both
Akt inhibitors, in LS174T and HCT116 cells (Figure
5A compare lanes 2 and 4, 6 and lanes 8 and 10,12). In
addition, western blot analysis showed that p21waf1
induction was decreased when Akt was inhibited (Figure
5B, compare lanes 2 and 4, 6 and lanes 8 and 10, 12). This
was expected since the kinase is known to regulate the
stability and localisation of the cell cycle inhibitor [3234]. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that p21waf1
downregulation occured in both cell compartments
without any cytoplasmic relocalization (data not shown).
This inhibition was confirmed using RNA interference to
downregulate Akt. Following sn38 treatment, p21waf1 was
induced as expected in the presence of a control siRNA. Its
expression was reduced when cells were transfected with
a siRNA directed against the kinase (Figure 5C, compare
lanes 3 and 4). Akt was downregulated as expected. Using
β-galactosidase staining, we also confirmed using RNA
interference that Akt inhibition reduced sn38-mediated
senescence as compared to cells transfected with a control
siRNA (Figure 5D, compare lanes 3 and 4, the same
effect was obtained in HCT116 cells (data not shown)).
The inhibition was less efficient as compared to the one
obtained with GSK690693 (Figure 5D, lane 5), probably
as a consequence of an incomplete downregulation of the
kinase. We then determined the effect of Akt inhibition on
PML (promyelocytic leukemia) bodies, nuclear structures
that are associated with senescence and genotoxic stress
[35]. As expected, PML bodies were detected after 72 hr
of sn38 treatment. Interestingly, Akt inhibition reduced
their number and this effect was observed with the two
different inhibitors, GSK690693 and Akti 1/2 (Figure 5E,
compare lanes 2 and 4, 2 and 6). To further confirm the
inhibition of the senescence pathway, we then analyzed
the expression of cyclin D1. This protein has recently been
described as an additional marker of senescence since its
level increased in response to several senescence-inducing
drugs [36-38]. We were able to confirm this observation in
different cell lines (data not shown and the upregulation of
cyclin D1 during sn38-mediated senescence is presented
Figure 5F, lanes 1-2). Interestingly, like p21waf1, this
protein was also downregulated when Akt was inactivated.
This effect was observed in LS174T cells and with the two
different inhibitors (Figure 5F, compare lanes 2 and 4, 6).
The inhibition was less obvious in HCT116 cells.
Thus, we concluded from these observations that
the inhibition of Akt prevents senescence induction in
response to sn38.

We were surprised that a better sn38 response was
observed in parallel to p21waf1 and senescence inhibition.
As the main mediator of sn38-mediated arrest, we expected
this pathway to be maintained, leading to a complete loss
of replicative potential [1]. To explain this observation, we
analyzed cell emergence in the absence of the cell cycle
inhibitor. Using first HCT116 p21-/- cells, we confirmed
that sn38-mediated senescence was significantly reduced
as compared to parental cells (Figure 6A). Interestingly,
p21waf1 inactivation significantly reduced the number of
persistent clones in response to sn38 (Figure 6B). These
results were confirmed by a second approach in LS174T
cells, using RNA interference to downregulate p21waf1.
Again, and as compared to cells transfected with a control
siRNA, p21waf1 inactivation significantly reduced the
number of PLC clones (Figure 6C). Western blot analysis
confirmed the downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor
(Figure 6C, left).	Since p21waf1 is activated by p53 in
response to genotoxic treatment [39, 40], we also analyzed
the role of this tumor suppressor during cell emergence.
As expected, p53 was upregulated and phosphorylated
on its Ser15 residue following sn38 treatment (Figure
6D). Results also confirmed that its inactivation by
RNA interference prevented p21waf1 activation (Figure
6E, compare lanes 4 and 3). Significantly, almost no
cells were able to escape sn38 treatment when p53 was
downregulated. Representative images of crystal violet
staining and the quantification of emergence are shown
Figure 6F.
Altogether, we concluded from these results that
the inactivation of the p21waf1-p53 senescence pathway
reduced cell emergence and improved treatment efficacy.

Apoptotic cell death reduces cell emergence
following p21waf1 downregulation
As stated in the introduction, elegant results using
mice-models have reported that p53-mediated arrest
and senescence induce chemotherapy failure [16]. It
was proposed that an efficient cell cycle arrest prevents
mitotic catastrophy and consequently reduces cell death
and treatment efficacy. It is also known that p21-deficient
tumors are more sensitive to radiotherapy in vivo [41, 42].
In light of these studies, we therefore sought to determine
whether Akt inhibition and p21waf1 downregulation
reduced cell emergence through apoptosis. As we
previously described [18, 43], flow cytometry analysis
showed that sn38 induced a G2/M arrest. Interestingly,
Akt inhibition reduced this percentage of G2/M cells
and increased the proportion of subG1 cells. This was
observed both in HCT116 and LS174T cells and with the
two inhibitors (Figure 7A, compare lane 2 with 4, 6 and

8 with 10, 12, note that more subG1 cells were detected
in HCT116 cells). This induction of apoptotic cell death
was further validated by the detection of the active form
of caspase 3 by flow cytometry. Although less than 15%
of cells presented an active form of caspase 3 following
sn38 treatment, this percentage increased in the presence
of GSK690693 or Akti 1/2 (Figure 7B, compare lanes 2
with 4, 6 and 8 with 10, 12). The same effect was observed
when Akt was inactivated by RNA interference in LS174T
(Figure 7C, lane 4) and HCT116 cells (data not shown).
We then asked if this apoptotic cell death was related
to the downregulation of p21waf1. As described Figure
7B, when HCT116 cells were treated with sn38, apoptosis
was detected in less than 15% cells. By contrast, when
these experiments were performed in HCT116 p21-/- cells,
a significant increase in the number of subG1 cells was
observed (Figure 7D). The activation of caspase 3 was also
detected by western blot when p21waf1 was inactivated by
RNA interference in HCT116 cells (Figure 7E, compare
lanes 4 and 2). In addition, the downregulation of p53 also
led to caspase 3 activation in response to sn38 (Figure 7F,
compare lanes 4 and 2).
In light of these results, we concluded that Akt
inhibition improved sn38 efficacy and prevented cell
emergence through the induction of apoptosis.

Mcl-1 (Figure 8C, compare lanes 14 and 16).
If Noxa mediates apoptosis following Akt inhibition,
we reasoned that its inactivation should prevent cell death
and favor cell emergence. We first tested this hypothesis
by downregulating Noxa and analyzing caspase 3
activation in the presence of sn38 and GSK690693. As
expected, the combined treatment induced caspase 3
activation when cells were transfected with a control
siRNA, (Figure 8D, compare lanes 3 and 1). Interestingly,
Noxa downregulation prevented this activation (Figure
8D, compare lanes 4 and 3).
We then determined whether Noxa downregulation
and cell death inhibition led to increased cell emergence.
To test this hypothesis, this protein was inactivated by
RNA interference, cells were then treated with sn38
and emergence was evaluated after 15 days (See Figure
8E top). We did this experiment on HCT116 since
these cells express Noxa in response to sn38 which
was not the case for LS174T cells (Figure 8B, lane 2
and 8). The results presented in Figure 8E indicate that
Noxa inactivation effectively enhanced the number of
emergent cells, in comparison with cells transfected
with a control siRNA. Interestingly, and as previously
reported [49, 50], we noticed that Noxa inhibition led
to an increase in Mcl-1 expression (Figure 8D, lanes 2
and 4). This suggested that this survival protein might
explain cell escape in this condition as we previously
reported [18, 20]. To test this hypothesis and to further
determine if the effect of Noxa are indeed mediated by
Mcl-1 inhibition, we downregulated this pro-survival
protein by RNA interference. As expected, we observed
that Mcl-1 inhibition reduced the number of emergent
cells [18]. Interestingly, results also indicated that the
increased emergence observed in the absence of Noxa
was completely inhibited when Mcl-1 was downregulated
(Figure 8E).
Altogether, we concluded from these results that
Akt inhibition prevents sn38 persistence through Noxa
activation, Mcl-1 binding and apoptosis induction.

Noxa inhibits Mcl-1 to prevent cell emergence
We and others have recently reported that Mcl1 favors senescence escape and cell emergence [18, 20,
31, 44]. To determine whether Akt inhibition prevents
sn38 escape through the downregulation of this survival
protein, we first analyzed its expression by western blot.
GSK690693 or Akti 1/2 did not affect Mcl-1 level in
HCT116 cells and we did not obtained any reproducible
effect in LS174T cells (Figure 8A). Although previous
experiments have reported that Mcl-1 levels are regulated
by the Akt-GSK3β pathway [45], this was not the case
in our experimental conditions. In addition, no effect was
observed on Bcl-xL which we and others have previously
shown to be upregulated in response to sn38 [18, 46]
(Figure 8A).
Besides its downregulation, Mcl-1 is also
inactivated following its titration by Noxa [47]. In
response to sn38, we found that this pro-apoptotic protein
was weakly induced in HCT116 but not in LS174T cells
(Figure 8B, compare lanes 1 and 2 ; 7 and 8, see also ref
[48]). Interestingly, Noxa was significantly upregulated
in the two cell lines following Akt inhibition (Figure
8B, compare lanes 2 and 4, 6; 8 and 10, 12). Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we observed that Noxa
weakly interacted with Mcl-1 in HCT116 cells following
sn38 treatment. This interaction was further enhanced
when Akt was inhibited (Figure 8C, compare lanes 8
and 6). In LS174T cells, the combined use of sn38 and
GSK690693 also induced a significant binding of Noxa to

Apoptosis can still be induced when senescence is
established
We then determined if we could reduce senescence
when this suppressive mechanism was already activated.
To this end, cells were pretreated with sn38 for 4 days and
Akt was inhibited for three days after this initial treatment
(see the experimental approach Figure 9A, RPMI 10%
FBS was added as a control). Senescence was detected
through p21waf1 expression and β-Galactosidase staining
(Figure 9B, compare lanes 2 and 1; Figure 9C, compare
lanes 2 and 1). Interestingly, when Akt was inhibited in
this senescent population, we still observed that p21waf1
expression could be downregulated (Figure 9B, compare
lanes 4-5 with 3). In addition, we also noticed a significant

decrease in β-Galactosidase staining (Figure 9C, compare
lanes 4-5 with 3). Western blot experiments indicated that
Noxa was also induced when the kinase was inhibited in
senescent cells (Figure 9D, compare lanes 4 and 5 with 2
and 3). These effects were observed with the two different
Akt inhibitors, GSK690693 and Akti 1/2.
In light of these results, we concluded that Akt
inhibition can still reduce senescence and upregulate Noxa
when this suppressive pathway is already induced. Since
the definition of senescence implies that it is a definitive
mechanism, this might suggest that the Akt inhibitors

target a subpopulation of cells where senescence is not
complete.

DISCUSSION
Understanding intrinsic or adaptive resistance
pathways in response to chemotherapy is one of the
main challenges of cancer treatment. Progression can be
explained by tumor heterogeneity and by the presence
of pre-existent resistant cells. Intrinsic drug resistance,
abnormal drug transport and detoxification enzymes or

enhanced DNA repair can all favor the selection of specific
subclones [23]. In addition, cancer cells can also adapt
to chemotherapy during the course of the treatment. For
instance, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
the consequent generation of cells with cancer-initiating
cells features represent an important source of therapeutic
failure [51-53] [54]. These dedifferentiation pathways
are used by cancer cells in stressful conditions to finally
reconstitute dividing populations. Therefore, a complete

eradication will certainly rely on combination therapies
that can kill at the same time the bulk of the sensitive
tumor and the persistent clones.
To understand these adaptive mechanisms, we have
recently developed two models of senescence escape,
either in response to the Ras oncogene [17] or during
chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS) [18-20]. In both
cases, we have observed that a subpopulation of cells
can escape senescence and emerge as a more aggressive,

Figure 10: Emergence in response to sn38 is associated with increased Akt activation: apoptosis induction should
reduce irinotecan and senescence failure in colorectal cancer. In response to sn38, a small fraction of cells escapes the senescence

suppressive arrest and emerges as an heterogeneous and more transformed population (see also reference 18). Akt is activated during the
early step of this response and in the emergent dividing cells. Its presence favors cell emergence and its inhibition consequently improves
sn38 efficacy by reducing the senescence suppressive arrest and activating apoptosis instead. We speculate that these emergent cells are
responsible of treatment failure and disease relapse. Therefore, sequential Akt targeting should be considered in the future to improve the
treatment of irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers through the induction of apoptosis.

are needed to determine if these CD133+CD44+CD24+
cells are also involved in the resistance to sn38 and if they
could define the PLD subpopulation.
In light of these observations and at least in response
to irinotecan, it is tempting to conclude that apoptosis is
a superior suppressive mechanism as compared to CIS.
As stated in the introduction, it is not particularly clear
whether these responses should be considered to be equal
suppressive pathways [15]. Senescent cells produce
soluble factors involved in cell migration, angiogenesis
and EMT [12-14], and CIS can induce the failure of
chemotherapy in vivo [16]. In line with this last study,
our results suggest that inducing apoptosis increased
treatment efficacy in comparison to CIS. Simply, one
can consider that obtaining a dying tumor cell is a better
treatment achievement than inducing a complete loss of
replicative potential. If correct, this might also imply that
p53-deficient tumors have a better response to irinotecanbased treatment, as recently proposed for breast tumors
treated with doxorubicin [16]. As stated above, in the
absence of this tumor suppressor, cancer cells progress
more efficiently to mitotic catastrophy and apoptosis.
Since multiple studies have found contradictory results
on this subject [16], further studies will be necessary
to define the role of the p53-senescence pathway in
irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers. We believe that
a correct interpretation will probably be more complex. If
senescent cells are effectively removed by immune cells in
vivo, this was neither tested in our in vitro conditions nor
using immuno-deficient mice. Thus a complete evaluation
of senescence efficacy as compared to apoptosis relies on
more complex experimental approaches. A more precise
study of senescence as a tumor suppressive mechanism
implies future experiments that incorporate immune antitumoral responses to study sn38 responses.
In addition to its phosphorylation in the early stage
of CIS, we have observed that Akt is more active in the
subpopulation of dividing PLD cells as compared to the
senescent PLS cells (Figure 3C). Although this remains to
be proved, this suggests that the benefit of Akt inhibition
will depend on the heterogeneity generated within the
residual tumor by irinotecan. Subpopulations emerging
from chemotherapy that express less active Akt could
be spared by this targeted therapy and remain viable.
Thus, in vivo testing must be carried out on established
tumors to determine whether this combined treatment
elicits a complete eradication of cancer cells. In this case,
sequential treatments should be used to allow -and then
target- the outgrowth of emergent cells from the primary
tumor. Note however that further experiments are also
necessary to clarify the interactions between the PLS and
PLD subpopulations. We speculate that a cooperation
between these two subpopulations is necessary to sustain a
survival niche. We believe that targeting Akt or a survival
pathway within one subpopulation will affect the other.
These results also illustrate the utility of combining

dividing population. It is striking that in these two cases,
the persistent cells depend on Bcl-xL and/or Mcl-1, two
survival proteins of the Bcl-2 family. This suggests that
during the initial senescence induction or during the latter
stages of tumor escape, apoptosis is a fail-safe mechanism
that is inactivated by Bcl-xL and/or Mcl-1. It should be
noted that apoptosis and senescence are believed to be
generally exclusive and the manner in which cells select
one of these two suppressive mechanisms is not clearly
determined [15].
In this study, we further extend this observation,
showing that the pharmacological inhibition of Akt
prevented cell emergence in vitro and the growth
of persistent cells in vivo in mice. Emergence was
inhibited as a consequence of apoptosis induction, Noxa
upregulation and binding to Mcl-1. Most significantly,
this was observed in parallel with senescence inhibition
and a reduced induction of p21waf1, the main mediator of
CIS. Using either RNA interference or p21waf1-deficient
cells, we also observed that the presence of an intact p21senescence pathway allows cell emergence and that its
downregulation improved the efficacy of the treatment.
The same improvement was observed following p53
inactivation.
As we previously discussed [18], we need to
consider the possibility that a subpopulation of resistant
cells already present before the treatment could induce cell
emergence. However, we consider this unlikely since the
emergent cells have the same sn38 sensitivity as compared
to parental cells [18]. In addition, they grow in low
adhesion conditions whereas this is not the case of LS174T
cells in our experimental conditions [18]. Note also that
we obtained the same number of emergent cells if our
experiments were performed in 10% or 3% serum (data
not shown). Thus quiescent cells are probably not involved
in treatment escape. Although this remains to be proved,
our hypothesis is that sn38 induces a phenotypic switch
that allows the emergence of a specific subpopulation. If
true, this might also explain why the Akt inhibitors are
still efficient after 4 days of treatment despite the fact that
Akt phosphorylation returned to basal levels (Figure 1D).
This phenotypic switch is expected to occur in a very low
percentage of cells. If rare cells rely on Akt signaling after
2-3 days of treatment to regrow and induce emergence,
it is certainly difficult to detect its activation by global
western blot, in a small subpopulation. Therefore, it will be
important to identify specific cell surface markers of PLD
and PLS cells. This will determine if these cells are present
before the treatment but it will also allow their tracking
during the response. Using classical markers such as lgr5,
CD133, CD44 or ALDH activity, we have described that
persistence was not associated with an increase in cancer
initiating cells [18]. Interestingly, it has been reported that
Akt is activated in a specific subset of cancer stem cells
that express CD133, CD44 and CD24 [55]. These cells are
resistant to radiation-induced cell death. Further studies

SN38 concentrations and assays

a pro-apoptotic therapy with a first line treatment known to
induce senescence. It has been recently demonstrated that
these two mechanisms can cooperate in vivo to prevent
the growth of Myc-driven tumors [56]. We therefore
propose that Akt inhibitors might be useful to prevent
cell emergence in response to irinotecan-based treatments
(Figure 10). Although this remains to be demonstrated
in vivo, sequential chemotherapy might be used to first
induce senescence and secondly target the specific
subpopulations that use the Akt rescue pathway. Inhibitors
of the Akt and PI3K pathways have been tested in early
stage clinical trials and it seems that their clinical efficacy
is generally low when used as monotherapies [57]. Since
Akt inhibition activates survival feedback pathways [27],
combination therapies with lapatinib, trastuzumab or antioestrogen are undergoing clinical evaluation. Provided that
the combination is not toxic, we therefore propose to test
the hypothesis that Akt inhibitors reduce the occurrence of
irinotecan-refractory colorectal carcinomas when used in
sequential therapies.

Various assays were used in this study, either short
time (flow cytometry, MTT, protein expression/interaction)
or longer time such as clonogenic assay to visualize all
treatment responses (mitotic catastrophy, senescence,
long terme proliferation recovery or quiescence). IC50
concentrations were always determined by clonogenic
assays, typical responses are presented Figure 1A (note
that clonogenic test and IC50 value are thus not equivalent
to a toxicity measurement). In short time assays (4 days)
and in the emergence experiments, cells were plated at
a higher concentration and are thus expected to be less
sensitive to sn38 as compared to clonogenic tests. In these
conditions, the topoisomerase inhibitor was always used at
5 ng/ml (12.7 nM), a higher concentration that is expected
to target all cells (see Figure 1A). Note that this is also the
concentration that is detected in the serum of the patients
[58]. For short time assays, GSK690693 was used at
20µM, Akti 1/2 at 10µM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded at 1500 (LS174T) cells or 500
(HCT116) cells into 6-well and incubated at 37°C in 5%
CO2 atmosphere. One day later, the cells were treated with
sn38 (0.15 to 1 ng/ml; 0.381 nM to 2.5 nM), GSK690693
(0.1 to 10 µM) and Akt ½ inhibitor (1 to 5 µM) for 7 to
10 days, washed twice with PBS, and stained with 0.4 %
crystal violet. The colonies were then washed with water,
visualized with a Bio-Rad Chemi Doc XRS Imaging
device and counted using Quantity One Imaging software
(Bio-Rad). The survival fraction was determined as the
percentage of the treated colonies as compared to the
number of colonies grown without drug.

Cell lines and treatment
All cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (except HCT116 p21-/- cells obtained
from Dr B. Vogelstein). Cells were maintained in
antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and were routinely tested
to rule out mycoplasma contamination. Cell treatments
were performed in 3% FBS except for the detection of
Akt activation (10% FBS to improve the Akt Ser473 blot,
Figure 1). To induce persistent cell generation, LS174T
cells were treated for 4 days with sn38 (5 ng/ml or 12.7
nM; Tocris Bioscience 2684) in 3% FBS, washed with
PBS and then restimulated with fresh 10% FBS for 7 days.
Note that generating persistent HCT116 took more time
since cells do not regain their proliferative potential easily.
In this case, cells were restimulated twice with fresh 10%
FBS; after 4 days of sn38 treatment and after 7 days of
emergence. Clones were generally counted after 2 to 3
weeks. Note also that emergence did not rely on the serum
concentration, the same number of clones and the same
p21waf1 expression can be observed in 10% or 3% FBS.

MTT assay
Cell viability was also measured by the MTT
(3-4,5-dimethylthiazol 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well clear-bottomed plates
at a density of 2500 cells per well in 200 µL medium,
incubated for 24 hrs, and treated with sn38 (5 ng/ml or
12.7 nM), GSK690693 (20 µM) and Akti ½ (10 µM)
and their combination. Four replicates per concentration,
per treatment were done. After 72 hrs, 40 µL of 5 mg/
mL MTT solution was added to each well and incubated
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C for 3 hrs.
After incubation, the cells were pelleted and dried.
Subsequently, 100 µL of DMSO (dimethylsulfoxyde) was
added to each well, and the cells were incubated at room
temperature for 2-3 hrs. Absorbance was measured by a
microtiter plate reader at 562 nm.

Akt inhibitors
GSK690693 was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline
and dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM
before use. For tumor xenograft studies, GSK690693 was
formulated in 10% DMSO and used at 10 mg/kg. The Akt
1/2 kinase inhibitor was obtained from Sigma (A6730).

Cells were fixed using 2% formaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes at room
temperature and were then permeabilized by incubating
for 30 minutes in ethanol 70% at −20°C. After washing
3 times in PBS-0.02%Tween and blocking in PBS-5%
serum during 15 min, the cells were incubated for 4 hour
at room temperature with an anti-PML antibody (mouse
monoclonal IgG1, Santa Cruz : sc-966, (1/50)) diluted in
the blocking buffer. After washing 3 times in PBS-0.02%
tween and blocking in PBS-5% serum during 15 min,
cells were incubated with the secondary antibody 1/200
diluted (Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody Alexa
488, Invitrogen-Molecular Probes : A-10680) for 1 hour
at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed 3
times in PBS-0.02%Tween, and covered with Anti-Fading
reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen Prolong R. Gold antifade
reagent with DAPI P36935). Slides were then analyzed by
confocal microscopy.
