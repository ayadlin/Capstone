Abstract
First line therapy for non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
commonly includes combination therapy with a tubulinbinding agent (TBA) and a DNA-damaging agent. TBAs
suppress microtubule dynamics by binding to the B-tubulin
subunit of A/B-tubulin, inducing mitotic arrest and apoptosis.
Up-regulation of class III B-tubulin (BIII-tubulin) has been
implicated in clinical resistance in NSCLC, ovarian and breast
tumors treated in combination with a TBA and DNAdamaging agent. To investigate the functional significance of
BIII-tubulin in resistance to both these classes of agents, small
interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of
this isotype in two NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H460 and Calu-6.
Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting showed that
BIII-siRNA potently inhibited the expression of BIII-tubulin,
without affecting the expression of other major B-tubulin
isotypes. Clonogenic assays showed that BIII-siRNA cells were
significantly more sensitive to TBAs, paclitaxel, vincristine,
and vinorelbine, and for the first time, DNA-damaging agents,
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and etoposide compared with controls.
Cell cycle analysis of H460 BIII-siRNA cells showed reduced
accumulation at the G2-M boundary and an increase in the
sub-G1 population in response to TBA treatment compared
with control cells. Importantly, BIII-siRNA cells displayed a
significant dose-dependent increase in Annexin V staining
when treated with either paclitaxel or cisplatin, compared
with controls. These findings have revealed a novel role for
BIII-tubulin in mediating response to both TBA and DNAdamaging agent therapy and may have important implications
for improving the targeting and treatment of drug-refractory
NSCLC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9356–63]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world with >1
million cases diagnosed every year, and remains the leading cause
of cancer death in both men and women (1). Advanced non–small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for >80% of lung cancer
cases. More than half of these patients have developed metastasis
at the time of diagnosis and chemotherapy remains the most
effective treatment option (2). Tubulin-binding agents (TBA) such
as paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinorelbine are widely used in the
treatment of NSCLC, either as single agents or in combination with
other platinum compounds such as cisplatin and carboplatin. In

fact, platinum-based doublets are considered to be the standard
treatments for NSCLC (3, 4). However, the prognosis for patients
remains dismal due to the emergence of drug-resistant tumors
which significantly limits the clinical utility of these drugs in the
treatment of lung cancer.
TBAs such as taxanes and Vinca alkaloids constitute the most
important group of chemotherapeutic agents, with activity against
a broad range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
These agents target the h-tubulin subunit of the a/h-tubulin
heterodimers that assemble to form microtubules. Microtubules
are dynamic polymers that play a key role in many fundamentally
important cellular processes such as vesicular transport, maintenance of cell shape, and cell division. In mammals, there are at
least six a- and seven h-tubulin isotypes, encoded by multiple
genes that display differential tissue expression. Selection of cancer
cells for resistance to TBAs could lead to alterations in h-tubulin
isotype composition. In particular, increased expression of the
neuronal specific class III h-tubulin (hIII-tubulin) has been
frequently implicated in drug-resistant cancer cell lines (5, 6).
Importantly, there is mounting clinical evidence that hIII-tubulin
expression is involved in the resistance to taxanes and Vinca
alkaloids in lung (7–9), breast (10, 11), and ovarian cancers (12–14).
In addition, in nonneuronal cancers such as NSCLC, the expression
of hIII-tubulin is associated with poorly differentiated tumor tissue
and high-grade malignancy, as well as increased metastatic
potential (15). Despite strong correlational evidence in preclinical
and clinical studies, its role in drug response is far from clear.
Stable overexpression of hIII-tubulin in human prostate cells failed
to confer resistance to TBAs (16–18). In contrast, transfection of
hIII-tubulin into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells confers lowlevel resistance to paclitaxel (19). A recent study showed that CHO
cells exogenously overexpressing hIII-tubulin had reduced suppression of microtubule dynamics in the presence of paclitaxel
compared with control cells (20). We have previously shown that
antisense oligonucleotides targeted against the hIII-tubulin isotype
partially reversed paclitaxel resistance in a NSCLC cell line, A549T12 (21). To date, the available functional data largely focuses on
the role of hIII-tubulin in paclitaxel resistance, and the relevance of
this isotype in resistance to other TBAs is not known. In addition,
despite the common use of cisplatin and related agents in
combination therapy with TBAs in NSCLC, the role of hIII-tubulin
in response to these agents has not been addressed.
To identify the functional role of hIII-tubulin in response to
chemotherapy in NSCLC, we employed the RNA interference
technique to knock down hIII-tubulin expression in two independent lung cancer cell lines that express this isotype. Knockdown of
hIII-tubulin corresponded with increased sensitivity to TBAs.
Interestingly, the knockdown cells also exhibited increased
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that are structurally and
functionally unrelated to TBAs. This report shows that hIII-tubulin
expression could mediate the response to microtubule-stabilizing

and -destabilizing agents, and for the first time, DNA-damaging
agents in NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and small interfering RNA transfection. Human NSCLC
cell lines H460 and Calu-6 were maintained as monolayers in RPMI
and DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mmol/L of
L-glutamine. The cells were grown at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2.
The hIII small interfering RNA (siRNA) SMARTpool reagent was obtained
from Dharmacon Research, Inc. The nonsilencing control siRNA, which has
no sequence homology to any known human gene sequence, was used as a
negative control in all experiments (Qiagen). Cells were transfected with
hIII siRNA at a final concentration of 25 nmol/L (Calu-6) and 100 nmol/L
(H460) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The optimal amount of siRNA used for transfection was
determined empirically for each cell line and the lowest siRNA
concentration that gave effective silencing of the targeted protein and
caused minimal stress to the cells was used in all subsequent experiments.
Control experiments were done in parallel by transfecting the cells with a
nonsilencing control siRNA (Qiagen) at equivalent concentrations as the
target siRNA. All experiments involved the use of a LipofectAMINE-only
control (mock-transfected) and a nonsilencing control siRNA (negative
control).
Cytotoxic drugs. Cytotoxic drugs were obtained as previously described
(22). Paclitaxel (Calbiochem, Merck Biosciences) was prepared at a stock
concentration of 2 mmol/L in DMSO. Vincristine (Sigma-Aldrich) was
prepared at a stock concentration of 2 mmol/L in saline (0.9% wt/vol NaCl);
vinorelbine (kindly provided by Dr. B. Hill, Division of Experimental Cancer
Research, Pierre Fabre Research Centre, Castres, France) was solubilized in
water at a stock concentration of 2 mmol/L. Doxorubucin (doxorubicin
hydrochloride; Pfizer) was prepared at a stock concentration of 3.45 mmol/L
in saline. Etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared at a stock concentration
of 68 mmol/L in DMSO and cisplatin (Pharmacia) was prepared at a stock
concentration of 3.3 mmol/L in saline.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples were DNase-treated, reversetranscribed for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using
methodology and specific primers as described in detail previously (12).
h2-Microglobulin was used as an internal control.
Western blot analysis. Preparation of protein lysates as well as Western
blot analyses were done as described previously (23), using antibodies
directed against hI-tubulin (clone SAP 4G5; Abcam, Ltd.), hII-tubulin (clone
7B9; Chemicon), hIII-tubulin (clone TUJ1, Chemicon), hIV-tubulin (clone
ONS 1A6, Sigma-Aldrich), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Abcam Ltd.). Enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) was used for
detection. The blots were scanned using the Typhoon scanner and quantified
using ImageQuant software version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.).
Immunofluorescence staining. Briefly, siRNA-transfected cells were
plated in glass chamber slides and allowed to reach 70% confluence. Cells
were then treated with 10 nmol/L of paclitaxel and vincristine for 1 h. Drug
was then removed by washing cells with PBS. Immunofluorescence staining
was then done as described previously (23). For dual staining, cells were
first stained with hIII-tubulin followed by Cy3 anti-mouse fluorescenttagged antibody (GE Healthcare). This was then followed by staining with
a-tubulin and Cy2 anti-mouse fluorescent-tagged antibody (GE Healthcare).
Slides were mounted on a coverslip using DAPI II Counterstain (Vysis, Inc.).
Immunofluorescence microscopy was done using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Microscope (Zeiss), and images were captured using a Sensicam Charged
Coupled Device camera (PCO Imaging) and the Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software
(Media Cybernetics, L.P.).
Clonogenic assays. Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells
were harvested and plated into six-well plates for 6 h, prior to the addition
of various drugs as indicated in the figure legends. After 72 h of incubation,
the drug-containing medium was removed and replaced with complete

www.aacrjournals.org

growth medium. Medium was changed every 3 days for 7 to 10 days until
visible colonies formed. Colonies were simultaneously fixed and stained
with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol, and manually counted. Individual
stained colonies in each well were counted and the surviving fraction was
calculated as follows: colony number / (number of cells seeded  plating
efficiency), where plating efficiency is equivalent to the colony number
divided by the number of cells seeded in the drug-free medium.
Drug accumulation assays. Cellular uptake and retention of tritiated
substrate [3H]paclitaxel and [3H]vincristine were measured as previously
described (22). Briefly, cells were transfected in 12-well plates for 48 h. Drug
uptake was monitored by adding [3H]paclitaxel (14.7 Ci/mmol; final
concentration, 50 nmol/L; Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.) or [3H]vincristine
(7.1 Ci/mmol; final concentration of 12.5 nmol/L; GE Healthcare) to the
transfected cells for 2 h at 37jC. Cells were washed, hydrolyzed, and
counted as previously described. The amount of tritiated drug accumulated
in the cells was determined for duplicate samples and expressed as
picomoles of the drug per milligram of protein. At least three independent
experiments were done. Relevant positive controls were included, together
with vincristine-resistant neuroblastoma (BE/VCR10) and etoposideresistant breast cancer cells (MCF7-VP16), which have previously been
shown to overexpress multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and multidrug
resistance–associated protein 1 (MRP1), respectively (23, 24).
Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was
determined by transfecting H460 cells with siRNA for 72 h and harvesting
(adherent and suspension) cells 24 h after drug treatment. DNA content
was stained for 15 min at 37jC with a solution containing 0.4% Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich), 50 Ag/mL of propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), and
2 Ag/mL of DNase-free RNase (Roche). The cells were then analyzed for
cell cycle perturbation using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The
CellQuest program was used to quantitate the distribution of cells in each
cell cycle phase: sub-G1 (apoptotic cells), G1, S, and G2-M.
Detection of apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC staining. Apoptosis
induction was determined by transfecting H460 cells with siRNA for 72 h and
harvesting (adherent and suspension) cells 48 h after drug treatment, as
previously described with slight modifications (25). Briefly, 1  105 cells were
incubated with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide for 15 min in the dark
(Becton Dickinson), immediately followed by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Cytogram analysis was done using Cell
Quest software.
Statistical analysis. A two-tailed Student’s t test was used for statistical
analysis of comparative data using the GraphPad Prism program. Data were
expressed as means of at least three independent experiments F SE, with
P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results
Specific silencing of BIII-tubulin in NSCLC cell lines. To
examine the effects of hIII-tubulin siRNA transfection on the
gene and protein expression of the isotype, RT-PCR and Western
blotting were used. Treatment of H460 and Calu-6 cells with
hIII-tubulin siRNA resulted in significant knockdown of hIIItubulin mRNA levels compared with the mock- and control
siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). This result was consistent with
the decrease observed at the protein level (Fig. 1B). The hIIItubulin siRNA specifically targets hIII-tubulin and has no crossreactivity with other h-tubulin isotypes examined as shown by
Western blotting (Fig. 1C). In addition, silencing of hIII-tubulin
did not cause compensatory changes in the other isotypes
examined.
Silencing of BIII-tubulin disrupts microtubules upon paclitaxel or vincristine treatment. To assess the effects of hIII
down-regulation on microtubule organization, immunofluorescence staining was done on transfected Calu-6 cells. The hIII
siRNA-transfected cells showed no observable changes to
microtubule morphology (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistent with

the Western blotting data, a clear decrease in hIII-tubulin
immunofluorescence intensity was observed in the hIII-tubulin
siRNA-treated cells compared with both the control siRNA- and
mock-transfected cells when imaged under identical conditions
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
To examine the effect of TBAs on hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated
cells, cells were exposed for 1 h to either 10 nmol/L of paclitaxel or
vincristine, and cellular morphology was examined. As shown in
Fig. 2, hIII siRNA-transfected Calu-6 cells showed extensive
disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton as compared with the
control-treated cells. The majority of the hIII siRNA-treated cells
were rounded and many of these cells displayed abnormal cellular
or nuclear morphology (Fig. 2, arrows). The control-treated cells
occasionally showed minimal bundling of microtubules normally
associated with paclitaxel treatment but the frequency of rounded
cells and the extent of microtubule disruption was minimal
compared with hIII transfectants.
BIII-tubulin silencing increases sensitivity to TBAs. The data
in the preceding section suggested that silencing hIII-tubulin
expression may have increased the sensitivity of the cells to both
paclitaxel and vincristine. To quantitate any change in drug sensitivity,
drug-treated clonogenic assays were done. Consistent with the
immunofluorescence observations, hIII-tubulin silencing resulted
in a significant increase in sensitivity to paclitaxel and vincristine

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

(Fig. 3A and B). In addition, the hIII-tubulin silenced cells exhibited
enhanced sensitivity to vinorelbine compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. S2). The increased sensitivity was not due to altered
accumulation of drug as there was no significant difference in the
intracellular drug accumulation levels in the hIII-tubulin siRNAtreated Calu-6 or H460 NSCLC cells compared with mock and control
siRNA-treated cells (Table 1).
BIII-tubulin silencing increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents. Previous studies modulating hIII-tubulin levels have only
focused on the effects of paclitaxel sensitivity (11, 19, 21). As NSCLC
is often treated with a TBA in combination with a DNA-damaging
agent, such as cisplatin, we sought to determine whether the drug
sensitivity effects of hIII-tubulin silencing are specific to TBAs.
Therefore, drug-treated clonogenic assays were also done using
DNA-damaging agents, etoposide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin.
Interestingly, hIII-tubulin silencing resulted in increased sensitivity
to all three DNA-damaging agents tested in H460 cells (Fig. 3C).
Similar results were obtained with Calu-6 cells (data not shown).
Because H460 cells have wild-type p53 (26) and the Calu-6 cells
harbor mutated p53 (27), sensitivity to these drugs is independent
of the p53 genotype.
Knockdown of BIII-tubulin abrogates paclitaxel- and vincristine-induced G2-M arrest and induces an increase in sub-G1
population. To determine whether hIII-tubulin silencing affects
the cell cycle profiles, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry was
done. The cell cycle profiles of H460 cells were not affected by
hIII-tubulin silencing (Fig. 4). To determine whether the TBAs
affected the cell cycle profiles of hIII-tubulin siRNA transfectants,
cells were treated with either paclitaxel or vincristine. Following
24 h of incubation with 5 nmol/L of paclitaxel, the hIII-tubulin–
silenced cells had a higher sub-G1 content (apoptotic cells)
compared with the control siRNA-treated cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A),
although both the hIII-tubulin siRNA and control siRNA-treated
cells had a similar increase in G2-M content compared with
untreated samples. A major difference was observed with 40 nmol/L
of paclitaxel, with the control siRNA-treated cells showing a
marked G2-M block whereas the hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated cells
had a marked increase in the sub-G1 population reflective of
apoptotic cells (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed when siRNAtreated cells were exposed to vincristine (Fig. 4B), suggesting
that there is a common mechanism that enhances the effects of
both the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids following hIII-tubulin silencing.
Knockdown of BIII-tubulin increases the sensitivity of cells
to apoptosis in the presence of either paclitaxel or cisplatin.
To address whether the increase in the sub-G1 population
following TBA treatment in the hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated cells
was related to an increase in apoptosis induction, we did
Annexin V-FITC staining followed by flow cytometry analysis.
Incubation of H460 cells with paclitaxel for 48 h induced
apoptosis from 1 nmol/L in hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated cells and
5 nmol/L in control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, at all
tested paclitaxel concentrations (1, 2, and 5 nmol/L), the
percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in hIIItubulin siRNA-treated cells than in control siRNA-treated cells
(Fig. 5A). Similarly, in hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated cells exposed to
cisplatin for 48 h, there was a significant increase in the
number of apoptotic cells in the 0.4 or 1 Amol/L cisplatin-treated
cells compared with controls (Fig. 5B). Taken together, this data
shows that hIII-tubulin silencing sensitized cells to apoptosis
induction following TBA and DNA-damaging agent treatment in
NSCLC.

bIII-Tubulin Mediates Sensitivity to Anticancer Drugs

Discussion
The clinical effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agents used in
the treatment of NSCLC is often negated by drug resistance.
Altered expression of specific tubulin isotypes, particularly hIIItubulin, has been strongly implicated in chemoresistance to the
microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel in preclinical and clinical
studies. To date, many studies have been correlative, with few
reports examining the role of hIII-tubulin in contributing to
resistance to microtubule-destabilizing agents or indeed, resistance
to other classes of agents used in the treatment of NSCLC. Herein,
we show that knockdown of hIII-tubulin in two independent drugnaı̈ve NSCLC cell lines sensitizes cells to both microtubulestabilizing and -destabilizing TBAs. The finding that hIII-tubulin
is important in the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents is novel
and shows that hIII-tubulin may be an important survival factor
that mediates drug response, even to drugs that do not directly
target the microtubule network.
One approach to identifying the role of specific h-tubulin
isotypes in drug resistance is to overexpress these proteins in cell
lines. However, altering the expression of specific tubulin isotypes
is far from straightforward due to the complexity of tubulin
autoregulation (28). As previously noted, overexpression of hIIItubulin in human prostate carcinoma cells failed to confer
resistance to a range of TBAs including colchicine, estramustine,
paclitaxel, and vinblastine (18). Of particular note, class II and
IVb tubulins were also increased collaterally in these transfected
cells (18). The reasons for this nonspecific regulation were
unclear, but as suggested by the investigators, might possibly be
due to a compensatory mechanism that overcomes the effects of
the elevated hIII levels. Expression of h-tubulin isotypes is tightly
regulated by an autoregulatory mechanism through cotransla-

tional degradation of h-tubulin mRNAs in response to an
increase in the level of soluble tubulin (28, 29). Hence, it is of
particular importance to analyze the total isotype profile to
confirm the contribution of the target isotype in drug response
studies. Importantly, the siRNA used in this study resulted in
specific down-regulation of the hIII-tubulin expression with no
compensatory changes observed with other h-tubulin isotypes
examined, further strengthening the role of hIII-tubulin in
contributing to chemosensitivity. In addition, the cell lines used
in this study have not been subjected to prior drug selection, and
are more likely to represent intrinsic drug resistance observed in
lung carcinoma.
We have previously shown that blocking hIII-tubulin expression in drug-selected NSCLC cells by antisense oligonucleotides
partially restored paclitaxel sensitivity in these paclitaxelresistant cells (21). The results presented here using hIIItubulin–specific siRNA supports our previous study with regard
to the role of hIII-tubulin in paclitaxel response. The finding that
hIII-tubulin silencing sensitizes NSCLC cells to Vinca alkaloids is
novel. At their lowest effective concentrations, TBAs suppress
microtubule dynamics in cancer cells, leading to mitotic arrest
and subsequent cell death, without changing the polymer mass
(30). Given the crucial role of microtubule dynamics in the
pharmacologic action of these drugs, one mechanism by which
hIII-tubulin has been thought to mediate resistance to TBAs is to
constitutively increase microtubule dynamics (31, 32). However, a
recent study showed that inducible stable overexpression of
hIII-tubulin in CHO cells did not significantly alter any variables
of microtubule dynamic stability, but reduced the ability of
paclitaxel to suppress the microtubule dynamics in these cells
(20). It remains to be determined whether down-regulation of

hIII-tubulin in NSCLC cells plays a dominant role in modulating
microtubule dynamics in a way that could enhance or reduce the
effectiveness of TBAs.
Of particular interest is the novel finding that hIII-tubulin
silencing significantly increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents. Although these agents are not known to directly target
the tubulin/microtubule system, the results are perhaps not
surprising due to frequent overexpression of hIII-tubulin in drugrefractory tumors which are commonly treated with a TBA in
combination with a DNA-damaging agent (8, 13). Ferrandina et al.
found that hIII-tubulin serves as a potent prognostic marker for
patients with ovarian cancer, regardless of whether the chemotherapeutic regimens include a taxane (14). The hIII-tubulin–
silenced NSCLC cells examined in the current study exhibited a
significant increase in apoptosis induction when exposed to
paclitaxel or cisplatin as revealed by Annexin-V staining. The
mechanistic basis for the increased sensitivity is not clear,
however, one possibility is that hIII-tubulin may serve as a
survival factor to rescue tumor cells from death signals triggered

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

by chemotherapeutic agents. In support of this hypothesis, a pool
of tubulin has been shown to localize in the mitochondria
membranes where it is associated with voltage-dependent anion
channels (33). Interestingly, this pool of mitochondrial tubulin is
enriched with hIII-tubulin, suggesting that this tubulin isotype may
be involved in mitochondrial-mediated cell death. Therefore,
we propose that altered expression of hIII-tubulin isotypes may
provide a cellular defense not only against TBAs but also against
diverse classes of DNA-targeting drugs.
TBAs are known to promote cell death by inducing a potent
mitotic block causing cells to accumulate at the G2-M phase of the
cell cycle (34). In the present study, the extent of the mitotic block
induced by incubation with either paclitaxel or vincristine seemed
to be markedly reduced in hIII-tubulin siRNA-treated cells as
compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. In contrast, the
level of apoptosis induction was significantly higher in hIIItubulin–depleted cells. These results suggest that suppression of
hIII-tubulin may enhance TBA-induced apoptotic cell death via a
separate pathway that is independent of classical mitotic arrest.

Although mitotic arrest is a hallmark cellular response to TBAs,
Milross et al. showed that the antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel is
dependent on its ability to induce apoptosis, but not mitotic arrest
(35). Previous studies with NSCLC A549 cells also found that low
concentrations of paclitaxel are sufficient to induce cell death
without an apparent G2-M block (36, 37). The exact mechanism is

not fully understood, although aberrant mitosis and p53 induction
have been suggested as possible mechanisms (36, 38).
Thus, the sensitization effects of hIII down-regulation on
apoptosis induced by TBAs may have broad significance and may
also explain, in part, its hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents.
In fact, similar results were obtained when treating the cells with

hIII-tubulin–depleted H460 cells treated

were harvested after 24 h of drug treatment
and subsequently assayed for their DNA
content by flow cytometry. Representative
figures of multiple experiments are

cisplatin in which hIII knockdown abrogated cisplatin-induced G2M arrest but showed an increase in the sub-G1 populations (data
not shown). So why does repression of mitotic block result in
apoptotic cell death in hIII-tubulin–depleted cells following drug
treatment? One possibility is that decreasing hIII-tubulin levels
may change the expression of microtubule-associated or interacting proteins. We addressed this possibility by examining for altered
expression of two important regulators of microtubule function
after hIII-tubulin knockdown, microtubule-associated protein-4
and stathmin, and found no significant change (data not shown).
We cannot exclude the possibility that changes in other
components of the cytoskeleton are affected. Potentially, hIIItubulin may serve as a survival factor to rescue tumor cells from
death signals triggered by chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, by
knocking down this survival factor, cells are hypersensitive to druginduced cell death. The mechanisms that enhance drug-induced
cell death after suppressing hIII-tubulin expression are currently
under active investigation.
Because TBAs and DNA-damaging agents have distinct cellular
targets, it is also possible that hIII-tubulin may enhance the drug
action of these agents via activation of signaling pathways shared
by both drugs or those specific to each drug. One potential
explanation for the novel enhancement of drug sensitivity by down-

regulation of hIII-tubulin in NSCLC cells is through regulation of
gene expression, e.g., for genes that are involved in apoptosis, DNA
repair pathway, or mitosis.
The finding that hIII-tubulin is involved in the sensitivity of both
taxanes and Vinca alkaloids highlights a common effect of this
isotype on microtubules and the action of TBAs. Importantly, hIIItubulin seems to play a broader role in chemosensitivity as shown
by its effects on DNA-damaging agent response. These results have
mapped out new challenges and opportunities for circumventing
drug resistance to improve the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer.
