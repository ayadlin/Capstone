ABSTRACT
Two genes are called synthetic lethal (SL) if their simultaneous mutation leads
to cell death, but mutation of either individual does not. Targeting SL partners of
mutated cancer genes can selectively kill cancer cells, but leave normal cells intact.
We present an integrated approach to uncover SL gene pairs as novel therapeutic
targets of lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Of 24 predicted SL pairs, PARP1-TP53 was
validated by RNAi knockdown to have synergistic toxicity in H1975 and invasive
CL1-5 LADC cells; additionally FEN1-RAD54B, BRCA1-TP53, BRCA2-TP53 and RB1TP53 were consistent with the literature. While metastasis remains a bottleneck
in cancer treatment and inhibitors of PARP1 have been developed, this result may
have therapeutic potential for LADC, in which TP53 is commonly mutated. We also
demonstrated that silencing PARP1 enhanced the cell death induced by the platinumbased chemotherapy drug carboplatin in lung cancer cells (CL1-5 and H1975). IHC of
RAD54B↑, BRCA1↓-RAD54B↑, FEN1(N)↑-RAD54B↑ and PARP1↑-RAD54B↑ were shown to
be prognostic markers for 131 Asian LADC patients, and all markers except BRCA1↓RAD54B↑ were further confirmed by three independent gene expression data sets
(a total of 426 patients) including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of LADC.
Importantly, we identified POLB-TP53 and POLB as predictive markers for the TCGA
cohort (230 subjects), independent of age and stage. Thus, POLB and POLB-TP53
may be used to stratify future non-Asian LADC patients for therapeutic strategies.

adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking, but among
never-smokers, adenocarcinoma is the most common
subtype of lung cancer. Multiple genes are mutated during
tumorigenesis, with those contributing to tumor formation
and growth are called cancer genes [2]. Cancer genes

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide
in terms of both incidence and mortality [1]. Nearly
40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma. Most cases of

can be categorized into oncogenes, tumor suppressor
genes and stability genes. Mutant oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes drive cancer cell proliferation while
stability genes are involved in maintenance of genome
integrity. Although to date some therapeutics directed
against oncogenes have led to increases in patient survival,
many fail due to intrinsic or adaptive resistance of the
cancer cell population to the therapeutics. For example,
in lung adenocarcinoma, efficacy of EGFR-inhibition is
reduced by downstream KRAS-activating mutation [3].
Two genes are called synthetic lethal (a type of
genetic interaction described in [4]) when a simultaneous
mutation of both genes leads to cell death, but a single
mutation of either does not. Genome-scale mappings of
SL genes in S. cerevisiae were obtained through highthroughput synthetic genetic array analyses [5–7]. Wong
and colleagues [8] successfully predicted synthetic sick
or lethal (SSL) interactions in S. cerevisiae by integrating
multiple types of data, e.g., gene expression, proteinprotein interaction and properties of network topology
of a gene triple. In C. elegans, Zhong and Steinberg [9]
computationally integrated interactome, gene expression
and phenotype data to predict genome-wide genetic
interactions; they further experimentally verified the
predictions for two human disease-associated genes.
The concept of synthetic lethality can be applied
to exploit cancer-cell specific mutations for therapeutics
[10] as follows. Targeting synthetic lethal (SL) partners
of mutated cancer genes will selectively kill cancer cells
but spare normal cells. Therefore, the synthetic lethality
strategy offers an elegant alternative to killing cancer
cells with non-druggable mutant tumor suppressor genes
and stability genes, for example, TP53 and BRCA1, by
targeting their SL partners. The clinical relevance of
synthetic lethality has been rapidly recognized. For
example, pioneering studies of SL partners in BRCA1
and BRCA2-deficient cancer cells identified PARP1 as a
promising drug target [11, 12]. Multiple phase II and III
clinical trials of PARP inhibitors have been conducted for
breast and ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation [13, 14]. Over the last few years, genes having
SL interactions (SLs) in cancers have been actively studied
by individual RNAi experiments or large scale RNAi
screenings that uncover multiple SL gene pairs [15–17],
which in general were centered on one gene such as
KRAS. Astsaturov and colleagues identified SLs in humans
by combining both computational and experimental
approaches [18]. They first combined pathway maps,
protein-protein interactions, gene expression data and
human orthologs of Drosophila Egfr genetic interaction
partners, to predict 2,689 SL candidates of EGFR. They
then selected 683 candidates for RNAi screening, by their
appearance in at least two of these information sources or
by prior biological knowledge, which resulted in 61 SL
genes of EGFR. Recently, Jerby-Amon and colleagues [19]
developed an extensive computational pipeline to analyze
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a large volume of genomics data, by detecting events
of co-inactive genes that occur less often than expected
and analyzing somatic number alterations and DNA
mutation, followed by RNAi knockdown experiments to
identify SL gene pairs and drug resistant pairs in cell lines.
Importantly, various inhibitors of PARP1 for patients with
BRCA1/2 mutation have entered phase III trials in breast,
ovarian, pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma [20]).
Although large-scale RNAi screening to identify
SL pairs has been available, the false positive problem
remains to be resolved. To augment these RNAibased experimental methods, we have developed an
integrated approach to uncover SL gene pairs for lung
adenocarcinoma (LADC). Our approach incorporates
SL pairs in the literature, gene expression data, protein
expression (immunohistochemistry (IHC) of LADC
tissues) and phenotypic (clinicopathological factors)
data, to predict SL gene pairs, then two prioritized pairs
are verified by shRNA inhibition in lung cancer cells.
Prognostic and predictive markers are also explored, and
validated by multiple sets of external data. A graphical
representation of our approach is presented in Figure 1.

RESULTS
Initial panel of candidate tumor-dependent gene
pairs for lung adenocarcinoma
We first collected 668 SL pairs, most of which were
validated by genome-wide RNAi screenings in various
cancers [15, 16], while the remaining SLs were verified
via individual RNAi knockdown experiments using
cancer cell lines [11, 12]. By screening across these SL
pairs using microarray gene expression data of various
cancerous and non-cancerous tissues (a pilot study), we
found that some gene pairs, e.g., FEN1-RAD54B, were
simultaneously differentially expressed in high fractions
of several cancerous tissues including LADC. This was
consistent with the finding that co-expression of gene pairs
was a relevant feature for predicting genetic interactions
(including SL interactions) genome-wide in S. cerevisiae
and C. elegans [6, 8, 9].
In general, tumor cells depend on the overexpression
of oncogenes and/or under-expression of tumor suppressor
genes. Validated SL pairs comprised oncogenes, tumorsuppressor genes and stability genes [2]. We hypothesized
that tumor cells may depend on differential expression of
some of these gene pairs and their protein products for
survival and/or proliferation. Further, the more closely
functionally related an SL pair is, the more frequently
the genes may be simultaneously differentially expressed
in cancer tissues. Thus, the collected SL gene pairs were
sifted by 83 paired Asian LADC tumor and non-cancerous
tissues. The fractions of the co-expression (up, up), (up,
down), (down, up) and (down, down) patterns, where up
and down denoting up- and down-regulation with the cutoff

1.5-fold, were computed (see Materials and Methods for
details). To include as many potential TD pairs as possible,
any gene pair with any pattern exceeding one percent
was included. Because RNAi knockdown is easier than
overexpression of a particular gene, we sorted the gene
pairs by the fractions of the (up, up), (up, down), (down,
up), and then (down, down) patterns as shown in Table 1,
which includes genes highly mutated in Asian LADC such
as EGFR and TP53 [21] (see Materials and Methods).
Although the overexpression of tumor-suppressor
and stability gene pairs, for example, DNA repair and
checkpoint classes such as FEN1 in Table 1, seem
surprising at first glance, it is consistent with the drastic
increase in genomic instability and DNA replication
caused by mutant oncogenes such as KRAS and MYC.

Next, from Table 1 we selected 20 genes, which
were from the top-11 gene pairs excluding MET and
PAK3, but additionally including CSNK1E and CDH1 (SL
to TP53 and EGFR, respectively). IHC of the 20 proteins
were stained; most were stained at one cellular location,
except BRCA2, FEN1 and MSH2 which were stained at
two cellular locations (Table 2; some representative IHC
figures are shown in Supplementary Figure S1), using
LADC tissues dissected from 131 patients from Changhua
Christian Hospital, Changhua City, Taiwan (see Materials
and Methods). IHC of these proteins confirmed the trends
of their mRNA expression.

Figure 1: A graphical schematics of our approach. Microarray gene expression of 83 paired cancerous and non-cancerous tissues
was used to sift tumor dependent gene pairs of lung adenocarcinoma from 668 collected synthetic lethal (SL) pairs, which resulted in 20
genes for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Combining the 23 IHC into pairs and correlating them to the each of five clinical factors yielded
24 predicted SL pairs. Finally, we validated the predicted SL pairs by the literature and shRNA knockdown.

Synergistic correlation

To extend the analysis beyond the known SL pairs
(Supplementary Table S1), we combined the 23 individual
protein IHCs in Table 2 into all the possible distinct pairs
(250 in total), excluding the pairs of the same protein
stained in different cellular locations. This procedure
allows novel SL pairs to be unraveled. The cancer
phenotypes observed (for instance, tumor grade) suggested
that the tumor cells may depend on each protein pair for
viability and, therefore, simultaneously mutating each TD
pair may kill tumor cells. Further, protein pairs relevant
to tumor cell viability and malignancy may be indicated
by their paired correlation with clinical features of LADC
patients. To identify SL pairs, we then tested each protein
pair for two synergistic effects with five clinical features,
overall survival, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis,
metastasis and stage (Supplementary Dataset S1). For
simplicity, henceforth, we have omitted the location
attached to the protein name; for example, CSNK1E(C) is
written as CSNK1E, unless ambiguity arises.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A pair of proteins is said to have a synergistic
correlation if their paired abnormal IHC is significantly
correlated (P < 0.05; Fisher’s exact test) with a
clinicopathological feature (for example, tumor grade),
but the abnormal IHC of each single protein is not.
This synergistic effect can be utilized to uncover tumor
dependent gene pairs, because an individual gene’s
mutation is not significantly correlated to a phenotype
(clinical feature); however, simultaneous mutation of a
gene pair is.
Any protein pair passing this screening for synergy
was predicted to be SL, because this synergistic effect
implies that abnormal IHC of a protein pair is associated
with a cancer phenotype (for example, overall survival),
but the abnormal IHC of each individual protein is not.
In other words, LADC cells seem to depend on each of
these protein pairs, but not on each individual protein, for

were less correlated (in terms of p-value being larger) with
a clinical feature than their IHC pair.
Applying both synergistic effects to the 250 IHC
pairs resulted in 24 predicted SL pairs (Table 3). Those
marked in light yellow were predicted by the synergistic
correlation, while the remaining ones were predicted from
the putative synergistic correlation. In each synergistic
effect, Fisher’s exact test (see Materials and Methods)
was applied to test the significance of the correlation
(P < 0.05), and the false discovery rate of a test was
estimated by the q-value (qvalue in R), which measured
the proportion of false positives incurred when the test was
claimed significant [23]. The complete results are shown
in Supplementary Table S2. Although FDR values in Table
3 may seem large at a glance, but their cutoff should refer

maintenance of viability. Thus, simultaneous mutation
of each TD pair may eliminate the tumor cells, which
is synthetic lethality [22]. Although coexpression and
phenotype have been shown to be useful in predicting SL
interactions in model organisms [6, 8, 9], this synergistic
effect is novel in (1) prioritizing the gene pairs coexpressed in cancer cells and (2) treating clinical features
of cancer patients as phenotypes.

Putative synergistic correlation
Next, we relaxed this synergistic correlation
to a putative synergistic correlation, which allowed
any individual IHC of an IHC pair to be significantly
correlated with a clinical feature, but both individual IHCs

to similar studies, e.g. 0.467 of CTNNB1-TP53 in [22],
which was verified to be SL.
Checking the predicted SL pairs (Table 3) against
the literature (searched up to December 2014), we found
that FEN1-RAD54B, and BRCA1-TP53 were validated
SL pairs [24, 25] in colorectal cancer and cervical cancer
cells, respectively. Knockdown of BRCA1, BRCA2 or
BRCA1/2 rendered TP53-deficient cervical cancer (HeLa)
cells 4- to 7-fold more sensitive to cisplatin treatment than
matched wild-type TP53 cells [25]. These validated pairs
demonstrate that our method is able to uncover SL gene
pairs without being limited by pathway information or
prior knowledge of whether a gene is involved in cancer.
Mutation in genes involved in DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1)
or in DNA damage stress response pathways such as
TP53, can lead to increased DNA damage and genome
instability. Therefore, double mutations in TP53-BRCA1
or TP53-BRCA2 may kill cells by “stress overload” [26].
Of these predicted SL pairs in Table 3, two verified
in the literature were predicted by the synergistic effect
and four pairs were predicted by the putative synergistic
effect. In particular, checking the putative synergistic
effect of the IHC pairs with metastasis led to three
verified TP53 SL pairs. Note that TP53 has a very
large sequence mutation score in LADC (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table S6a in [21]) and it is mutant in
half of all cancers. Predicted pairs ranking higher than
the known SL pairs in Table 3 suggested six candidate
SL pairs. Further, we sifted these candidate pairs using
the “2hop SL-SL” concept (Table 1 of [8]), namely if
PARP1 was SL to BRCA1 and BRCA1 was SL to TP53,
then PARP1 was likely SL to TP53; similarly CSNK1ERB1 might be SL.
Our rules for prioritizing predicted SL pairs for
validation were, (1) incorporating prior knowledge, for
example, known SL pairs or/and pathway information; and
(2) using biological importance, for example, predicted SL
pairs consisting of frequently mutated cancer genes in the
cancer of interest.

Knockdown effect of shRNA was validated by PCR
(Supplementary Figure S2) and the western blot analysis.
Cell viability was examined by the MTT assay and the
colony formation assay for detecting the short-term and
the long-term cell killing effects, respectively. The results
of the MTT assay (Figure 2A) showed that knockdown of
TP53 or PARP1 did not affect the cell viability in A549
cells. However, TP53 knockdown or knockdown of both
TP53 and PARP1 in CL1-5 cells reduced the cell viability
while PAPP1 knockdown or knockdown of both TP53 and
PARP1 in H1975 cells also decreased it. The p-values of
the viability of cells with knockdown of TP53 and PARP1
individually compared to the control are 0.837 and 0.600
in A549 cells, 0.002 and 0.256 in CL1-5, and 0.057 and
0.001 in H1975 cells, respectively. Moreover, knockdown
of both genes markedly reduced the cell viability in
CL1-5 (P < 0.0001) and H1975 cells (P < 0.0001), but
not in A549 cells (P = 0.154). Further, we found that
active caspase 3 was increased in CL1-5 and H1975 cells
with knockdown of TP53, PARP1 and both (Figure 2B),
indicating that knockdown of TP53 and PARP1 induced
apoptosis in CL1-5 and H1975 cells.
To examine the long-term cell killing effects of gene
knockdown, the colony formation assay was performed.
Similar to the MTT results, knockdown of TP53, PARP1
or both remarkably and significantly reduced the colony
number in CL1-5 and H1975 cells, but not in A549 (Figure
2C). Thus TP53 and PARP1 have a synergistic killing
effect in CL1-5 and H1975 cells, but not in A549 cells,
which may be due to a different mutation background in
A549 cells from CL1-5 and H1975 cells. Similarly, we
used these three cell lines to verify whether FEN1-TP53
is SL, however, no SL effect could be validated in these
cell lines (data not shown). Nevertheless, our approach
successfully uncovered the synthetic lethality of PARP1TP53 in highly metastatic lung cancer cells.
Moreover, we studied the cytotoxic effect of the
combination of PARP1 silencing and some chemotherapy
drugs for lung cancer, such as carboplatin and pemetrexed,
by the MTT assay. We found that PARP1 knockdown
enhanced carboplatin and pemetrexed-induced cell death
in CL1-5 and H1975 cells (P < 0.05; two sample t-test),
except one case had marginal significance (CL1-5 cells
treated with 100 nM Pemetrexed having P = 0.052), but
not A549 cells. Compared to pemetrexed, carboplatin may
be better for NSCLC treatment (Supplementary Figure
S3).

PARP1-TP53 is validated to synergistically kill
lung cancer cells by RNAi knockdown
We selected three lung cancer cell lines, A549, CL15 and H1975, as in vitro models to validate that TP53PARP1 is SL. A549 cells with the wild types of EGFR and
TP53 carry the KRASG12S mutant. CL1-5 cells are highly
invasive and harbor the TP53R248W mutant and the wild
types of EGFR and KRAS, while H1975 cells harbor the
wild-type KRAS, the TP53R273H mutant and the EGFRL858R
T790M
somatic mutation, which is commonly mutated in
EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant Asian LADC.
We transiently co-infected A549, CL1-5 and H1975 cells
with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting TP53,
PARP1, PARP1-TP53 and control, respectively (Figure 2).

individual IHC, we applied the log-rank test to the 131
Asian LADC patients (Supplementary Table S3). The
results showed that the estimated survival curve of patients
with over-expressed IHC of RAD54B was significantly
separated from that of the remaining group (P = 0.00044;
Figure 3), and overexpressed RAD54B was correlated
with poor survival. Next, of the predicted SL pairs
in Table  3, patients with abnormal IHC expression (by

Table 2) of each of BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1(N)-RAD54B
and PARP1-RAD54B had a significantly different survival
curve than that of the remaining group (P = 0.00006,
0.00024, 0.00038, respectively, log-rank test; Figure 3).
There were another nine IHC pairs of RAD54B, which
also significantly separated the patients with poor survival
from the remaining group, but their p-values were less
significant than that of RAD54B alone.

External confirmation of the association of
RAD54B, BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1-RAD54B and
PARP1-RAD54B with poor survival

was confirmed to be significantly correlated with poor
survival (P = 5.8×10−5, 0.017 and 0.006, respectively).
Similarly, FEN1↑-RAD54B↑ and PARP1↑-RAD54B↑
(BRCA1↓-RAD54B↑) were validated by TCGA set with
P = 0.023 and 0.027 (HLM, P = 0.017), respectively,
where ↑ and ↓ denote 2-fold over- and under-expression
of the corresponding gene. The estimated survival curves
are in Supplementary Figure S4. This external validation
demonstrates that these markers can be used to screen
future LADC patients if their IHC, MGED or RNA-seq
are available, thus, they may have wide applications.

Ethnicity and geography are known to play a role
in the causes of cancer. If the markers uncovered above
can be confirmed by independent data sets of LADC
patients from diverse geographic regions and ethnicities,
then they will be useful in clinical medicine. Thus,
we further analyzed two MGED sets of independent
cohorts of GSE13213 (117 Japanese patients [27] and
GSE68465†(HLM, 79 patients [28]) and RNA-seq of 230
LADC patients from the TCGA cohort (TCGA henceforth)
[29], although only ~40% of genes had expression levels
that correlated with those of their proteins in human. Of
these sets studied, 2-fold over-expression of RAD54B↑

Log ratios of the genes analyzed in the UM and CAN/DF
sets were also available, but their expression levels did
not pass the 2-fold threshold, while there was no control
in the MSK set.

RAD54B, BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1-RAD54B and
PARP1-RAD54B are independent prognostic
markers

0.024, respectively), while FEN1(N)-RAD54B and
PARP1-RAD54B were validated by TCGA (HR = 1.74
and 1.83 with P = 0.024 and 0.016, respectively); see
Supplementary Table S5B for details.

Prognostic markers, which provide information on
the likely course of cancer, can be identified from gene
or protein expression data [30–31]. Here we investigated
IHC of which individual proteins in Table 2 and which
predicted SL pairs (Table 3) were prognostic markers
in Asian LADC. A univariate Cox proportional hazard
regression analysis, applied to an independent cohort of
131 Taiwanese LADC patients, suggested that IHC of
RAD54B↑, BRCA1↓-RAD54B↑, FEN1(N)↑-RAD54B↑
and PARP1↑-RAD54B↑, where ↑ and ↓ denote overand under-expression of the corresponding IHC, were
prognostic markers (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.39, 2.81, 2.61
and 2.40 with P = 0.001, 1.2×10−4, 4.0×10−4 and 0.001,
respectively; Table 4A); see Supplementary Table S4 for
the results of all predicted SL pairs. Moreover, survival
analysis of three clinical covariates (age, sex and stage)
indicated that they were all significantly correlated with
survival (HR= 2.21, 1.99 and 2.69, with P = 0.004, 0.006
and 0.001, respectively; Table 4A).
Variance inflation factors indicated that RAD54B,
BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1(N) -RAD54B and PARP1RAD54B may have confounding effects (collinearity)
(Supplementary Table S5A), thus each of the above IHC
was entered separately into a multivariate Cox regression
analysis with the three clinical covariates. With stepwise
variable selection and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
a multivariate Cox regression showed that BRCA1RAD54B, age and stage were significantly associated
with the survival of LADC patients (HR = 2.19, 2.66 and
3.20 with P = 0.004, 0.001 and 7.5×10−5, respectively;
Table 4B). Similarly, RAD54B, FEN1(N)-RAD54B and
PARP1-RAD54B were also found to be significant (HR
= 1.82, 2.12 and 1.90 with P = 0.021, 0.007 and 0.016,
respectively; Table 4B), independent of age and stage.
Taken together, these results showed that RAD54B,
BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1(N)-RAD54B and PARP1RAD54B are prognostic markers independent of clinical
covariates.

POLB-TP53 and POLB are predictive markers
for LADC patients in TCGA
Finally, we studied which individual proteins
in Table 2 and the predicted SL pairs (Table 3) were
predictive markers that might help select LADC patients
for therapeutic strategies. We followed Shedden and
colleagues [28] to preprocess UM, HLM, CAN/DF and
MSK of GSE68465* (total of 443 subjects) and integrated
UM and HLM as the training set to fit Multivariate Cox
regression models without and with clinical covariates,
then applied the fitted models to predict risk scores of the
subjects in the validation sets MSK and TCGA (total of
103 and 230, respectively); CAN/DF was not applicable
due to lack of stage III and IV subjects. We used 1.5-fold
as the cutoff for all genes except 1.2-fold for POLB in
MSK. Further details can be found in the Supplementary
Methods and Results.
Of all individual and paired IHC investigated,
POLB-TP53 and POLB without (with) age and stage,
M1′ and M2′ (M1 and M2), were significant prognostic
markers for the training set. For completeness, we also
fitted Multivariate Cox regression models to the four
prognostic markers for Asian LADC, namely RAD54B,
BRCA1-RAD54B, FEN1-RAD54B and PARP1-RAD54B,
without (with) clinical covariates M3′-M6′ (M3-M6),
respectively; age, sex and stage were fitted as model
M7. These 13 models fitted by the training data are in
Supplementary Table S6.
Next, POLB-TP53 and POLB without (with) age
and stage were found to be significant predictive markers
for TCGA. POLB with age and stage were also predictive
markers for MSK, while POLB-TP53 was not applicable
to MSK, because no subjects therein had simultaneous
positive expression of POLB and TP53. Additionally, we
calculated the predicted risk scores of the subjects in MSK
and TCGA using the fitted models M3′-M6′ and M3-M7.
The estimated hazard ratios of the risk scores produced
by the 13 fitted models with 95% confidence intervals
(Supplementary Table S7) are depicted for MSK and TCGA
in Figure 4. Hazard ratios markedly greater than 1 indicate
that subjects in the validation sets with high predicted
risk scores had poor outcomes. Confidence intervals not
containing 1 indicate that the predictive markers performed
significantly better than expected by chance.

Validation of the prognosis markers using
external multi-site data sets
We further validated that RAD54B, BRCA1RAD54B, FEN1(N)-RAD54B and PARP1-RAD54B
were prognosis markers, using gene expression data from
three independent cohorts, GSE 13213 (117 Japanese
patients), HLM of GSE68465 (79 patients) and RNA-seq
of 230 LADC patients from TCGA. Each of these markers
with age, sex and stage were analyzed by a Multivariate
Cox regression. RAD54B was confirmed by GSE13213
and TCGA (HR =15.87 and 1.94 with P = 4.4×10−4 and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

*Biomarkers vary with race. We could only assess one set
of Asian MGED with subject outcomes (GSE 13213), thus
we could not study predictive markers for Asian LADC
via this machine learning approach.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed an integrated approach
to reveal SL gene pairs for cancer-cell specific therapeutics
and uncover prognostic and predictive markers of LADC.

73674

Oncotarget

The novelty of our approach lies in treating clinical
features as phenotypes and correlating all paired IHC of
sifted proteins to the phenotypes, which resulted in the
predicted SL pairs.
Of the two validated gene pairs, PARP1-TP53
was verified to have a synergistic cytotoxicity by siRNA
knockdown in H1975 and highly invasive CL1-5 lung
cancer cells. To date, cancer recurrence and metastasis
remain bottlenecks in cancer treatment and safety
regarding inhibition of TP53 is controversial [32].
Moreover, inhibitors of PARP1 have been developed, thus
PARP1 may be a new therapeutic target for LADC, in
which TP53 is commonly mutated (~46%) [29].
Further, we showed that silencing PARP1
enhanced the cell death induced by the platinum-based

chemotherapy drug, carboplatin, in lung cancer cells.
Several reports have also found that the synthetic lethality
was enhanced via combinations of PARP inhibitors and
platinum-based drugs in breast cancer [33] and lung
cancer [34, 35]. In addition to inhibitors of PARP1,
inhibitors targeting FEN1, RAD54B and POLB have been
developed, e.g., NSC-281680 and streptonigrin. Thus our
results have therapeutic potential for lung cancer.
Additionally, the predicted SL pairs FEN1RAD54B, BRCA1-TP53 and BRCA2-TP53 have been
verified in colorectal cancer [24] and cervical cancer
cells via RNAi knockdown [25]), respectively. Thus
those gene pairs with more significant synergistic effects
than these known SL pairs are also promising targets,
e.g., EGFR-RB1, for further siRNA experiments. These

results indicate that clinical factors of cancer patients
may be used as phenotypes to uncover synthetic lethality
between genes.
IHC
of
RAD54B↑,
BRCA1↓-RAD54B↑,
FEN1(N)↑-RAD54B↑and PARP1↑-RAD54B↑were shown
to be prognostic markers, independent of age and stage,
for 131 Asian LADC patients. Importantly, these markers
were confirmed by three independent gene expression
data sets from diverse geographic regions and ethnicities
(a total of 426 LADC patients), a Japanese cohort
(GSE13213, n = 117), HLM of GSE68465 and TCGA (n
= 230, ~99% non-Asian subjects).
Predictive markers may help select patients for
therapeutic strategies. Both POLB-TP53 and POLB were
shown to be predictive markers for LADC subjects in
the TCGA cohort. These markers may be used to stratify
future non-Asian LADC patients.

Our approach shares the same goal as the CTD2
Network by NCI [36]. Both methods aim to find patientbased cancer therapeutics via tumor dependence, with
the latter incorporating a network-based approach in
computation. Aiming for personalized medicine, our
approach can begin with pairing a patient’s highly mutated
genes (e.g., from targeted DNA sequencing data) with the
remaining genes in the genome, then the remaining steps
follow similarly.
With a rich repertoire of public domain gene
expression data (e.g., TCGA), commercially available
tissue arrays and matching clinical data, it is conceivable
that our approach can be applied to other cancers as well.
Finally, our method can be extended in the following
directions. First, the initial panel of known SL pairs can
be replaced by pairing a gene of interest, e.g., a frequently
mutated gene in colorectal cancer such as TP53, with all

other genes in a genome, and the remaining procedures

applied to several cancers to find their common SL gene
pairs for identification of common therapeutic targets.

each gene pair in Table 1, we performed a permutation
test by computing the fractions of each pattern, where
the labels of 83 cancer and non-cancerous tissues were
randomly exchanged 10,000 times to construct an
empirical distribution, from which the p-value of each
observed fraction was assessed. Next, we applied q-value
[23] (qvalue in R) to estimate false discovery rate of the
significance of the gene pairs and the predicted SL pairs in
Tables 1 and 3, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of a set of 668 SL gene pairs validated
in various cancer cells

Preparation of tissue microarrays

We first collected 668 gene pairs whose SL
interactions were either validated using various human
cancer cell lines [11, 12] or genome-wide RNAi
knockdown [15, 16] (Supplementary Table S1).

One hundred and thirty one representative cancer
specimens were chosen from hematoxylin and eosin–
stained sections and confirmed by pathologists. Four
tissue cores (2 mm in diameter) were obtained from each
paraffin block from which three cores of cancerous and
one core of noncancerous tissues were cut longitudinally.
The tissue cores were set into new paraffin blocks using
a fine steel needle to produce tissue microarrays. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
and Ethics Committee of Changhua Christian Hospital,
and Institutional Review Board of Academia Sinica.

Computation of gene expression profiles of lung
adenocarcinoma versus non-cancerous tissues
We selected gene expression data sets using the
following criteria: having both cancer and non-cancerous
tissues, no treatments, no metastasis and affymetrix chips
(up to Nov. 2010). The LADC gene profiles satisfying the
above criteria were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus database (GEO) [37]. Because mutated genes
involved in the oncogenesis of a given cancer are known
to vary between patients of different ethnic backgrounds
[21], we collected gene expression data from Asian
patients (GSE 7670 and 19804 in GEO), the same ethnic
background as the IHC and clinicopathological data used
in later sections. Gene expression profiles from 83 paired
cancer and non-cancerous tissues in the dataset were first
quantile-normalized (expresso in R), then for a given gene
the log ratio of its expression in each cancer tissue versus
the paired non-cancerous tissues was computed. The
dataset used can be assessed via http://www.stat.sinica.
edu.tw/gshieh/ladc/mged.xls.

Immunohistochemistry
The sections (4 μm) of tissue microarray were
deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated in serial dilutions
of alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched by 3% H2O2. The sections were performed
by treatment with boiling citrate buffer (10 mmol/L)
for 20 minutes for antigen retrieval. The tissues were
then incubated with 23 primary antibodies. Incubation
with the primary antibody was carried out for 30
minutes at room temperature, followed by rinsing threetimes with phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were
incubated with a horseradish peroxidase/Fab polymer
conjugate for another 30 minutes. After rinsing, the
chromogen was developed with 3,3′-diamino-benzidine
tetrahydrochloride as the substrate and hematoxylin as
the counterstain. The staining intensity in the cancerous
tissue was examined by two pathologists (Kun-Tu Yeh
and Jau-Chung Hwang). The scoring criteria were
similar to those in [38]. Specifically, the stain intensity
was graded as negative-0, indeterminate-±, weak
positive-1+, moderate positive-2+ or strong positive-3+.
For staining intensity negative-0, there is no expression
of the detected protein; for indeterminate-±, the staining
is weak and its percentage cannot be accurately counted;
for weak positive-1+, there is less than 5% expression
of the detected protein in the cancer cells; for moderate
positive-2+, there is focal expression in 5-20% of the
cancer cells; for moderate positive-3+, there is diffuse
expression over 20% of the cancer cells. Tissues with 2+
and 3+ staining of each antibody were classified as the
overexpression group.

Inferring the initial panel of TD gene pairs for
lung adenocarcinoma using microarray gene
expression data
For each collected SL pair we looked for the
simultaneously up-regulated pattern [abbreviated as the (up,
up)], one up-regulated and one down-regulated patterns
[(up, down) and (down, up)] and the simultaneously downregulated pattern [(down, down)], where the cutoff of upand down-regulation was 1.5-fold, owing to the 2-fold
cutoff being too stringent for this data set; the fractions
of these patterns of the 83 LADC patients were computed
using the log ratios of gene expression data.

Fisher’s exact test

Cell viability assay

Fisher’s exact test was conducted to determine
independence between IHC expression levels of each
predicted SL pair and clinicopathological factors. IHC
expression levels of each protein were dichotomized into
two classes, abnormal and normal, according to the criteria
in Table 2. Further, clinical factors of 131 LADC patients
were also dichotomized as follows; survival time < 3 years
versus ≥ 3 years; tumor grade poorly-differentiated cells
versus well and moderately differentiated cells; metastasis
yes versus no; lymph node metastasis N1-2 versus N0; and
stage III and IV versus I and II.

Cell viability was examined by MTT assay for
detecting short-term cell killing effects and by colony
formation assay for detecting long-term cell killing effects.
Cell viability of 2000 cells with gene knockdown for 72
hours was examined by MTT assay, performed using
manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). For
colony formation assay, 250 cells with gene knockdown
were cultured for 10 days. Then colonies were stained
with 0.5% crystal violet in 70% ethanol and counted.

Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test

Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in RIPA buffer
(0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton
X-100 in 1 x TBS) with 100 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF,
30 mM Na pyrophosphate, and a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Total
proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to polyvinylidene membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA)
and probed with primary antibodies. The anti-β-actin
monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO), anti-PARP and anti-caspase 3 antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), anti-p53
antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). Antibodies were diluted in TBS (pH 7.5) containing
0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk. Blots were
incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Piscataway, NJ), and the bound antibodies were
visualized using ECL staining.

Western blot analysis

For each predicted SL pair, we generated KaplanMeier survival curves of the high and low risk groups of
patients using the software R, where the high and low risk
groups comprised patients whose paired IHC expression
levels were both abnormal and others, respectively. The
log-rank test was used to calculate the significance of the
differences between the survival curves of the two groups.

Cell lines
The lung cancer cell lines CL1-5 were derived
from in vitro transwell and in vivo metastasis selection
as previously described [39]. A549 and H1975 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (VA, USA). The CL1-5 and H1975 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum while A549 cells were maintained
in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cell lines were
incubated in the humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at
37°C.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
The cells infected with shLentivirus were harvested
for mRNA extraction with TRIzol reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), and then the reverse transcription was
performed. The cDNA was used to perform polymerase
chain reaction. The primers used to confirm TP53 mRNA
level were 5’-ACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAA-3’
and
5’-ACCATCGCTATCTGAGCAGC-3’.
The
primers used to confirm PARP1 mRNA level
were
5’-AGCGTGTTTCTAGGTCGTGG-3’
and
5’-CCCCTTGCACGTACTTCTGT-3’.

RNAi knockdown experiment
Plasmids each harboring gene-specific or scrambled
shRNA were ordered from the RNAi core, Genomics
Research Center, Academia Sinica. Lentivirus was
prepared in accordance with standard protocols. In brief,
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pAS2neoshRNA, pCMVΔR8.91, and pMD.G. Virus-containing
medium was collected at 24-, 48-, and 72-h posttransfection, and then the virus titer was measured.
The virus titer was estimated with HEK293 cells.
The A549, CL1-5 or H1975 cells were seeded in the 96well dish (2000/well), and these cells were infected with
shRNA lentivirus (MOI=2 each shRNA lentivirus, and
total MOI=4) in medium containing polybrene (8 μg/ml)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Post 24 h-infection,
cells were refreshed with the complete medium without
virus, then harvested for MTT assay, RT-PCR, or western
blot analysis at 72 hours after infection.
