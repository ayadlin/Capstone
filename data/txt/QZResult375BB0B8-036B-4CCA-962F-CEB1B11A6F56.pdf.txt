Combinatorial Chemotherapeutic Efﬁcacy in Non-Hodgkin
Lymphoma Can Be Predicted by a Signaling Model of CD20
Pharmacodynamics

Abstract
Combination chemotherapy represents the standard-of-care for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the
development of new therapeutic regimens is empirical and this approach cannot be used prospectively to
identify novel or optimal drug combinations. Quantitative system pharmacodynamic models could promote the
discovery and development of combination regimens based upon ﬁrst principles. In this study, we developed a
mathematical model that integrates temporal patterns of drug exposure, receptor occupancy, and signal
transduction to predict the effects of the CD20 agonist rituximab in combination with rhApo2L/TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand or fenretinide, a cytotoxic retinoid, upon growth kinetics in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
xenografts. The model recapitulated major regulatory mechanisms, including target-mediated disposition of
rituximab, modulation of proapoptotic intracellular signaling induced by CD20 occupancy, and the relative
efﬁcacy of death receptor isoforms. The multiscale model coupled tumor responses to individual anticancer
agents with their mechanisms of action in vivo, and the changes in Bcl-xL and Fas induced by CD20 occupancy
were linked to explain the synergy of these drugs. Tumor growth proﬁles predicted by the model agreed with cell
and xenograft data, capturing the apparent pharmacologic synergy of these agents with ﬁdelity. Together, our
ﬁndings provide a mechanism-based platform for exploring new regimens with CD20 agonists. Cancer Res; 72(7);

Major Findings
An integrated systems pharmacodynamic model developed from single-agent responses and known mechanisms
of drug action is able to predict with ﬁdelity the apparent
synergistic antitumor effects of rituximab administered
with fenretinide or rhApo2L in a non-Hodgkin lymphoma
model. Rituximab binding to tumor CD20 regulates both
drug exposure and antitumor response. Quantiﬁcation of
Bcl-xL and Fas modulation is sufﬁcient to explain rituximab
synergy without requiring empirical drug interaction parameters. The greater afﬁnity of rhApo2L for death receptor
(DR) 5 relative to DR4 can explain relative efﬁcacy of these
isoforms, and Fas may serve as a surrogate for rituximabinduced upregulation of these receptors.

Introduction
Despite improvements in overall survival over the past 20
years, therapy of indolent and refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remains an unmet challenge (1). Combination
chemotherapy represents standard-of-care, but the repertoire
of agents for NHL is expansive (2). Numerous ongoing trials
seek to identify drug combination regimens empirically that
improve therapeutic outcomes. However, a quantitative, mechanistic approach for predicting the effects of combination
therapies, based upon mechanisms of drug action and interaction, could assist development of more efﬁcacious NHL
therapies. A component of ﬁrst-line therapy and rapidly relapsing NHL is rituximab, a CD20 agonist. Its mechanism of action
includes induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cellular
proliferation (3). Rituximab upregulates cell surface expression
of Fas (Apo1) and Apo2 death receptors (4, 5), and reduces Bcl-2
expression, which sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic compounds (6). Preclinical NHL models suggest fenretinide, a
cytotoxic retinoid that induces apoptosis through caspase
activation (7), and rhApo2L/TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis
inducing ligand), which promotes apoptosis via death receptor
activation, synergize with rituximab (8, 9). These agents are
either approved (rituximab), or in phase III (fenretinide) or
phase I (rhApo2L) clinical development.
We sought to develop a quantitative, predictive systems
pharmacologic framework that would integrate commonly
obtained cellular response parameters, such as drug–receptor
interactions and cell-signaling activity, with outcome

System Model of Rituximab Combination Therapy

Quick Guide to Main Model Equations and Assumptions
The ﬁnal mathematical model is based on a series of ordinary differential equations that integrate key factors determining
antitumor efﬁcacy of rituximab alone and combined with fenretinide or rhApo2L (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
Supplementary Materials provides the complete system of equations.
Drug disposition
Simple PK models describe the time course of plasma drug concentrations for each agent. These functions drive intermediate
cell signaling and the effects of individual or combined drugs on tumor. For rituximab and rhApo2L, the models also account for
the loss of drug bound to tumor. Differential equations are speciﬁed for total and bound drug in the system. Free concentrations
are calculated assuming quasi-equilibrium conditions (10). The free rituximab plasma concentrations (CR) is:

in which Ctot and Rtot represent total rituximab and CD20 concentrations, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The
solution for rhApo2L is complicated by the presence of 2 receptors (DR4 and DR5); the resulting cubic polynomial is resolved by
obtaining its roots.
The molar concentration of drug receptors (CD20, DR4, and DR5) is calculated as a function of tumor volume (N; units
of mm3):

in which Rcell is cellular receptor density, DN is the tumor cell density (9.6  105 cells/mm3; ref. 11)), NA is Avogadro's number, and
Vc is the volume of plasma in contact with the receptors.
Signal transduction
Fractional CD20 occupancy by rituximab (fb,CD20) modulates a minimized signal transduction network (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The ﬁrst component is RKIP induction. The rate of RKIP expression change is:

simple transit compartment model of signal transduction deﬁnes downstream state variables for NF-kB, Bcl-xL, and Fas

Harrold et al.

Our approach was to develop a dynamic model linking drug
exposures with both underlying molecular events occurring at
the cellular level, and therapeutically relevant, tissue-level
responses such as changes in tumor burden. The macroscopic
exposures of rituximab, fenretinide, and rhApo2L, and the
efﬁcacy of these agents alone or in combination, have been
evaluated in vitro and in murine NHL xenografts (5, 6, 8, 9, 20–
22). We developed models of known molecular mechanisms of
action to link these disparate data quantitatively. The result is a
system-level PD model capable of predicting not only efﬁcacy
across studies, but also the apparent synergy observed preclinically with combinations of these agents. This mathematical framework provides improved understanding of the indirect relationships that relate anticancer drug exposure and
treatment response. The ﬁnal model can be used to explore
new drug combinations, optimize promising regimens, and
enhance insight generation from preclinical experiments with
CD20 agonists.

composite of individual drug actions and combined modulation of cellsignaling events. Dashed lines represent signaling information. Fraction of

measures of efﬁcacy such as tumor burden, thereby establishing a data- and model-based approach to optimize combination chemotherapies. Integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models can be used to characterize drug
concentration–effect systems, generate and test competing
hypotheses, and predict pharmacologic outcomes under different experimental conditions (12, 13).
Early PD models of chemotherapeutic agents employed
system-speciﬁc and drug-speciﬁc parameters, and plasma
drug exposure usually served as a surrogate for intratumor
drug concentrations, which ultimately drive pharmacologic
effects (14). For drugs that elicit rapid, irreversible effects, this
approach is accurate and useful. However, many chemotherapeutic agents show signiﬁcant temporal dissociation between
drug exposure (from measured plasma concentrations) and
pharmacologic responses. Where speciﬁc information about
drug mechanisms of action is lacking, several techniques have
been employed to account for this apparent hysteresis, including transit compartment models to represent time-dependent
signal transduction processes (15, 16) or cellular progression
through maturation or apoptosis (17, 18). Although empirical
functions describing drug interactions can extend these semimechanistic models (19), the approach nonetheless is driven by
speciﬁc experimental conditions rather than ﬁrst principles or
mechanisms of drug action.

A mathematical model based on a series of ordinary differential equations was developed to integrate the major factors
determining efﬁcacy of rituximab concomitant with fenretinide or rhApo2L. Figure 1 identiﬁes components of the model
and mechanistic interconnections between drug disposition
and efﬁcacy of these 3 agents. PK models, derived for the
unique behavior of each agent, provide predictions of plasma
drug concentrations that drive intermediate cell signaling and
the ultimate therapeutic effects upon tumor burden. In the
model, rituximab occupancy of CD20 drives inhibition of
tumor cell growth and inﬂuences various cellular signal transduction networks. Similarly, fenretinide and rhApo2L inﬂuence speciﬁc signal transduction pathways, and the resulting
tumor cell kill function (Fkill,tot) is a composite of direct and
indirect drug effects acting upon the tumor cell population.
Supplementary Materials provides a workﬂow schematic (Supplementary Fig. S1) and all equations deﬁning this system.
Data for drug exposure, rituximab inhibition of tumor
growth, and tumor growth dynamics were extracted from the
cited sources using Graphclick (Arizona Software). Parameter
estimation and model predictions were carried out with
MATLAB (R2009a; MathWorks Inc.). The fminsearch function
was used to identify the general region of parameters, and
lsqnonlin was used to identify the ﬁnal reported estimates and
solution summary information. A sequential modeling
approach was used, in which parameters associated with
systemic distribution and elimination, signal transduction
associated with binding, and inhibition due to drug plasma
concentrations were ﬁrst identiﬁed separately, and then ﬁxed
for subsequent estimations of single-agent efﬁcacy.
Systemic disposition
Supplementary Eqs. S1–S3 characterize systemic distribution and elimination of rituximab, fenretinide, and rhApo2L.
Fenretinide was characterized by a single-compartment model
with absorption from a peripheral site. Because Ramos xenografts express CD20 and DR4/DR5 receptors, rituximab and
rhApo2L studies (23, 24) obtained PK data in tumor-free

animals. Rituximab was characterized with a single-compartment model, and rhApo2L was characterized with a 2-compartment model.
Mechanisms of action
Rituximab efﬁcacy was driven by binding to CD20 receptors
(20) and rhApo2L by binding to the proapoptotic receptors
DR4 and DR5 (25, 26). Receptor interactions were driven by the
concentration of the agent in the system, the receptor concentration, and the ligand/receptor binding afﬁnities (KD).
Assuming that the rates of association and disassociation are
rapid relative to other dynamics of the system, a quasi-equilibrium approach (Eq. A) was used to determine receptor
occupancy (10).
Plasma-level exposures were linked with cell-level responses
such as apoptosis through CD20 receptor occupancy. The
fraction of bound receptors was also the input to a minimal
signal transduction cascade model, the output of which is
upregulation of Fas expression and downregulation of free
Bcl-xL. Sequential modeling was carried out wherein changes
in RKIP activation were modeled ﬁrst, and the parameters
obtained were then ﬁxed and used as an input to the portion of
the model describing NFkB signaling. A second-order model
was developed for RKIP (Eq. C), which can be deﬁned by a
coupled system of ﬁrst-order differential equations:

dxD

¼
 fb;CD20  RKIP  xD  DRKIP
ðFÞ
dt
tK
dRKIP
¼ xD
dt

ðGÞ

Finally, with upstream parameters ﬁxed, changes in Fas, and
Bcl-xL were modeled (Supplementary Eq. S8).
Fas expression was considered a surrogate for DR4 and DR5
abundance. Upregulation of Fas was used to upregulate the
surface receptor density of DR4 and DR5 and drive downstream signaling resulting from activation of these receptors.
Signaling associated with DR4 and DR5 receptors was driven by
receptor occupancy, as determined by the equilibrium binding
expression for a ligand having 2 receptors (Supplementary
Materials).
Efﬁcacy and target-mediated disposition
An exponential model characterizes nominal tumor
growth, consistent with the time frame of the data available.
Tumor growth rate was directly inhibited by plasma concentrations of rituximab according to a classic Hill relationship (Eq. D). Kill terms for rituximab, fenretinide, and
rhApo2L were derived to account for cell loss associated
with each of these compounds (Eq. E). Rituximab efﬁcacy
was proportional to the size of the tumor and the fraction of
bound CD20 receptors. The plasma concentration of fenretinide was used to drive its efﬁcacy, and for combination
treatment, the proportional effect of efﬁcacy attributable to
fenretinide was ampliﬁed by the estimated suppression of
Bcl-xL levels. The fraction of bound DR4 (fb,DR4) and DR5
(fb,DR5) was used to drive the efﬁcacy of rhApo2L, and for

www.aacrjournals.org

combination treatment, the effect was modulated by Fas
expression levels. For simulating the case in which additive
interaction effects were hypothesized, Bcl-xL and Fas effects
were held at their baseline values.
Data for untreated tumors from the fenretinide data set (8)
were used to set the initial tumor volume and estimate nominal
tumor growth kinetics. These parameters were then ﬁxed for
the estimation of efﬁcacy parameters for single-agent rituximab and fenretinide. Analysis of the rhApo2L data set began
by ﬁxing the initial tumor volumes to those reported (9) and
then simultaneously estimating the nominal tumor growth
rate and rhApo2L efﬁcacy. These parameter estimates were
combined with the rituximab efﬁcacy term obtained from the
fenretinide data set, and then used to predict efﬁcacy of singleagent rituximab in the rhApo2L data set. As cancer cells die, the
volume of the tumor decreases, and it was assumed that the
loss of cells also removes the drug bound to their receptors. For
small molecule drugs, the target-bound fraction may be inconsequential. However, concentrations of protein-based drugs
may be comparable with receptor concentrations, as is the case
for rituximab. To account for this, the PK models for rituximab
and rhApo2L were augmented to track the total amount of
drug in the system (boundþfree; Supplementary Eqs. S13 and
S14; ref. 10). Terms were then added to account for the loss of
bound rituximab as the tumor volume decreased.

Results
Systemic distribution and elimination
The time course of drug exposure is the initiating driver for
subsequent signaling and pharmacologic effects. Standard 1and 2-compartment models captured rituximab, fenretinide,
and rhApo2L pharmacokinetics. These general drug absorption and disposition properties were assumed to operate in
parallel with "target-mediated drug dispositional" effects (27)
that alter the PK of high-afﬁnity ligands such as rituximab
when their concentration is stoichiometrically comparable
with that of their receptors. Systemic PK proﬁles were modeled
for rhApo2L (Fig. 2B) and rituximab (Fig. 2D) after intravenous
injection in mice. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows fenretinide
disposition following intraperitoneal injection. Terminal phase
half-lives for rituximab, fenretinide, and rhApo2L were 22.7
days, 5.1 hours, and 2.6 hours, respectively, highlighting the
substantial PK differences among the 3 compounds. The
model-ﬁtted curves captured the data well, and the parameters
associated with these proﬁles (Supplementary Table S1) were
ﬁxed in the subsequent analyses.
Target-mediated dispositional effects of CD20, DR4, and
DR5 density
CD20 receptor occupancy was assumed to drive the intensity of rituximab response (28) and DR4/DR5 occupancy was
considered to drive rhApo2L responses (9, 29). High-afﬁnity
therapeutic ligands often are in a concentration range in which
interaction with their receptors alters plasma disposition (27).
Changes in tumor volume or the density of tumor-associated
receptors can inﬂuence pharmacokinetics, as observed for
rituximab (23). Therefore, receptor burden was calculated
dynamically based on tumor volume, the number of cells

per unit volume, and the receptor density. On Ramos cells,
CD20 receptor density is approximately 330,000 per cell (30),
approximately 3,726 per cell for DR4, and 4,790 per cell for DR5,
based upon relative ﬂorescence analysis (9). The inﬂuence of
tumor volume and CD20 receptor abundance on rituximab PK
was observable qualitatively (23), and Fig. 2D shows rituximab
pharmacokinetics after administration to mice bearing different initial burdens of CD20þ lymphomas. As tumor burden
increased, plasma concentrations of rituximab decreased,
reﬂecting an apparent increase in total systemic clearance
mediated by the CD20 burden attributable to tumor (Fig. 2D).
This physiologic target-mediated dispositional effect was
implemented in the model for systemic PK of rituximab and
rhApo2L by eliminating receptor-associated drug on dying
cells. The ﬁnal model predictions for rituximab disposition as
a function of hypothetical initial Ramos cell tumor burden
showed a similar trend as experimental systems across cell
lines (Fig. 2D).
Rituximab effects upon CD20 signal transduction
With CD20 density effects integrated explicitly in the model,
the fraction of bound receptors (fb,CD20) could be calculated

1636

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

and used to drive downstream cell signaling (Fig. 1). By
assuming that equilibration between free and bound rituximab
is rapid compared with the dynamics of drug disposition and
disease response, fb,CD20 can be calculated directly from the
total rituximab concentration (boundþfree; Supplementary
Eq. S10) and the total receptor number (10). The receptor
occupancy model was then used to drive the signal transduction and tumor growth inhibition models associated with the
proapoptotic effects of rituximab.
Exposure of CD20-expressing B cells to rituximab increases
expression of Fas/Apo1 and TRAIL-R/Apo2 receptors (20),
thereby sensitizing them to apoptotic signaling molecules.
CD20 activation also reduces free levels of Bcl class proteins
within the cytosol, via a combination of gene- and protein-level
interactions (20). Free Bcl-xL confers resistance to cytotoxic
compounds, and conversely, reductions in free Bcl-xL sensitize
cells. Several components of the signal transduction pathway
linking CD20 activation with Fas/Apo1- and Bcl-xL modulation
have been elucidated (4, 5, 21, 22, 31, 32) and were incorporated
in the model (Fig. 3A). The time course of RKIP activation,
NFkB signaling, Fas upregulation, and free Bcl-xL reduction
was obtained from the literature (5, 31) and used to construct a

minimal model of signal transduction (Fig. 3A), which was ﬁt to
available data (Fig. 3B). The key nodes in the minimal signaling
model were identiﬁed using discrete dynamic modeling of a
much larger signal transduction network (not shown). Once
the connectivity was deﬁned and ﬁxed (Fig. 3A), several
transfer functions, including traditional ﬁrst-order transit
compartments (15), were evaluated to capture the time course
of expression levels (Fig. 3B). The second-order system deﬁned
in Equations F and G was found superior to simpler transfer
functions. In the model, signal transduction responses were
represented as deviations from baseline values that maintain
steady-state conditions (5, 31), and the dynamic response was
driven by the fraction of bound CD20 receptors (Fig. 3B).
Whereas the model tracks measured Fas levels directly, rituximab also upregulated DR5 expression (20), for which data are
not available. However, because of the mechanistic and temporal similarities between Fas/Apo1 and other death receptors,
the structural model for Fas regulation was also used for
predicting rituximab-mediated changes in the abundance of
DR4 and DR5 (Supplementary Eqs. S11 and S12).
Rituximab inhibition of tumor growth
Rituximab can mediate tumor cell killing through both
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (33). However, in the available
data, efﬁcacy was quantiﬁed in immunocompromised animal
models. Therefore, these processes were considered negligible
and omitted from the ﬁnal model. Other primary mechanisms
of efﬁcacy include inhibition of cell proliferation (34) and
induction of apoptosis (35) via CD20 receptor occupancy. The
concentration dependence of Ramos cell growth inhibition
by rituximab was described previously (34) and was modeled
with a standard saturable function (Eq. D and Fig. 1). Figure 4
shows the model ﬁt to data. The capacity of the proliferation
inhibitory function (maximal effect attributable to this mech-

anism) was 14.3%, and the concentration of rituximab mediating half-maximal inhibition of proliferation (IC50) was
8.31  108 mol/L. Thus although rituximab inhibition of cell
proliferation impacts tumor volume progression, an additional
effect representing rituximab-induced apoptosis was required
to characterize observed in vivo responses (below).
Modeling single-agent efﬁcacy
The strategy for developing a predictive model for rituximab-based combination chemotherapy was to model singleagent effects on the PD markers selected and then combine
models under several hypothesized mechanisms of drug

interaction, including synergy and additivity. A simple exponential growth model was used to describe unperturbed tumor
growth, and a net ﬁrst-order rate constant represents the
balance of cell proliferation versus cell death. The effect of
treatment is to shift this balance by retarding the growth
function and increasing the cell elimination function.
Two studies of rituximab combinations on Ramos xenografts
provided single-agent data enabling a priori development of a
quantitative model for pharmacologic interactions. One investigated rituximab with fenretinide (8) and the other investigated rituximab with rhApo2L (9). From Gopal and colleagues
(8), a tumor doubling time of 142 hours was estimated in BALB/
c nude mice. Figure 5A shows that the model captured tumor
progression data well for untreated animals and those receiving
single-agent rituximab or fenretinide. Data from Daniel and
colleagues (9), which investigated rituximab and rhApo2L in
CB17 severe-combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice, was
then used to test the model developed for efﬁcacy of singleagent rituximab. A tumor doubling time of 63 hours was
estimated. By substituting the doubling time appropriate for
the speciﬁc tumor into the growth model, the rituximab efﬁcacy
term obtained in nude mice (8) provided an excellent prediction
of single-agent rituximab in SCID mice (Fig. 5B). Data (9) also
provided results for single-agent rhApo2L. Simultaneous ﬁtting
of tumor progression data for control and rhApo2-treated
animals showed that the developed model captured the data
well (Fig. 5B). By this approach, appropriate models were
developed for all 3 drugs as single agents.

testing whether simulations based on single-agent effects
could capture tumor responses to the agents combined. The
full model was used to simulate 2 tumor response scenarios
for fenretinide and rituximab administered according to the
regimen of Gopal and colleagues (8): one hypothesized that
drug effects were additive, whereas the other hypothesized
synergy arising from rituximab-mediated reduction in
Bcl-xL levels (Fig. 3), thereby amplifying efﬁcacy. The original study suggested the combination showed supra-additive
effects (8). Here, both models predicted the observed data
relatively well (Fig. 5A), and the regimen of the reported
study does not support a conclusion with regard to nature of
drug interaction.
The data for single-agent rituximab from Daniel and colleagues (9) are sparse, but its efﬁcacy was nonetheless well
predicted by the model (Fig. 5B), as was efﬁcacy of single-agent
rhApo2L. The data for combined rituximab/rhApo2L were
richer and enabled testing whether efﬁcacy predictions based
upon combination of single-agent responses would capture the
efﬁcacy observed for the combinations. As described for simulations with rituximab/fenretinide, simulations of rituximab/
rhApo2L included hypotheses of additive versus synergistic
interaction, with synergy postulated to arise through rituximab
modulation of Fas expression levels via the temporal relationship of Fig. 3. Figure 5B shows that tumor responses to
combined rituximab/rhApo2L are best predicted by hypothesizing synergistic interaction; the additivity model seriously
underestimated tumor response. Furthermore, the improved
ﬁdelity of the model to capture observed data for the combination when rituximab effects on Fas expression were included
suggests that Fas modulation may represent a quantitative PD
marker for the synergy of interaction.

System Model of Rituximab Combination Therapy

Figure 6. Relative contribution of death receptor isoforms to overall
efﬁcacy of rituximab/rhApo2L combination. Dosing schedules (arrows),
observed data (symbols), and synergistic model simulation of
experimental data from Daniel and colleagues (ref. 9; solid line) are as
in Fig. 5B. Dashed lines show simulated tumor response with rhApo2L
occupancy of only DR4 (DR5 inactive; dash-dot) or only DR5 (DR4
inactive; dashes).

Finally, the rituximab/rhApo2L interaction model was
interrogated to determine whether the relative contributions of DR4 and DR5 to overall efﬁcacy could be discerned.
Simulation predicts that DR5 provides the greater contribution to efﬁcacy in the combination regimen (Fig. 6),
consistent with in vitro knockout studies in lung carcinoma
cell lines (36). However, the model shows clearly that rhApo2L interaction with both DR4 and DR5 is required
to capture the full magnitude of experimentally observed
efﬁcacy (9).

Discussion
A multiscale systems pharmacologic model was created that
informs preclinical development of rituximab-based combination chemotherapies for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Fenretinide and rhApo2L were selected for analysis based upon prior
studies of these agents in combination with rituximab. Fenretinide is a cytotoxic, whereas rhApo2L induces apoptosis
through interaction with death receptors. The ﬁnal model
links plasma pharmacokinetics of rituximab, fenretinide, and
rhApo2L with PD effect biomarkers (Fas, Bcl-xL RKIP, and
NFkB) and overall antitumor efﬁcacy. A target-mediated dispositional PK model was employed to accommodate evidence
that rituximab interaction with cell-surface receptors affects
PK: Figure 2D shows that rituximab plasma concentrations
were lower in animals having higher CD20 body burden due to
tumor (24). The model predicts no effect of tumor burden upon
disposition of rhApo2L, which was also observed experimentally (not shown).
The ﬁnal model links drug exposure to efﬁcacy by using
informative mechanism-based biomarkers. Components of the
cellular models represented the contributions of both indirect

duction pathways and direct drug effects on tumor progression. The overall structure of the model (Fig. S1) may appear
complex, but derivation of individual components was driven
by well-understood physiologic and pharmacologic processes.
The model captures the transient effects of signal transduction
as driven by receptor occupancy (Fig. 3), and enables testing
hypotheses as to whether drug effects upon these pathways
promote synergistic or additive therapeutic effects.
Incorporation of quantitative mechanisms of drug action in
the system PD model preserves physiologic ﬁdelity, and the
impact of their inclusion upon the capability of the ﬁnal model
to explain experimentally observed phenomena underscores
their potential pharmacologic role. For example, the model
suggests that with rhApo2L treatment, DR5 contributes to
inhibition of tumor progression to a greater extent than DR4
(Fig. 6). Interestingly, there is little separation of DR4- and DR5only curves at early times, but they diverge around the second
treatment course. Comprehensive global sensitivity analysis
clearly is warranted to test signals relative to parameter
perturbations underlying this prediction. However, this model
component represents an explicit, quantitative accounting of
drug–target interactions, and is consistent with in vitro and in
vivo experimental results. The observed recapitulation of a
complex pharmacologic system results not from post hoc
ﬁtting of experimental data, but rather from a priori, quantitative integration of fundamental cellular and pharmacologic
response mechanisms, and testing of the model with data not
employed in model development.
The model for single-agent rituximab efﬁcacy extrapolated
well across multiple experimental studies, and required only
determination of the tumor growth kinetics; the cell-kill term
derived from one model system predicted efﬁcacy well with
another, underscoring the robustness of the underlying modeling approach. The predictive capability of the model was also
conﬁrmed (Fig. 5); remarkably, model predictions based on
single-agent efﬁcacy captured experimental data for combined
rituximab/fenretinide and rituximab/rhApo2L efﬁcacy well. In
addition, simulation permitted hypothesis testing with regard
to the nature of the pharmacologic interactions with combination therapy. It suggested that additivity versus synergy
could not be discriminated from existing experimental data
for rituximab/fenretinide (Fig. 5A), whereas both model predictions and experimental data for rituximab/rhApo2L suggested clearly that rituximab modulation of Fas expression
(Fig. 3) mediated a synergistic interaction (Fig. 5B).
The ﬁnal model also permitted exploration of the impact
signal transduction events have upon scheduling of the combination agents. Evidence for time-dependent processes could
identify opportunities to improve efﬁcacy by altering treatment schedule. For example, reconstruction of rhApo2L pharmacokinetics from dosing schemes used experimentally (Fig.
2) shows that rhApo2L is eliminated far more rapidly than
rituximab. As a result, rhApo2L concentrations fall rapidly
below the KD values of the DR4 and DR5 receptors, thus
limiting rhApo2L efﬁcacy in mice to the ﬁrst hour following
administration. Furthermore, the maximum rate of Fas upregulation by rituximab occurs over the ﬁrst 6 hours after drug
administration (Fig. 3).

Harrold et al.

As shown here, quantitative, physiologically relevant mathematical models based on underlying mechanisms of drug
action can be useful for integrating efﬁcacy and toxicity
information across preclinical experimental platforms and
identifying important factors regulating magnitude and time
course of drug response. However, this study and approach has
limitations. First, the cell-signaling model that predicts antitumor efﬁcacy of combinations with rituximab is speciﬁc for
CD20þ tumor cells. Second, further research is required to
identify sources of intertumor variability in signal transduction
and their inﬂuence on drug responses. Third, our model of
CD20-induced signal transduction is deliberately minimal;
although Bcl-xL and Fas expression provided insight into
rituximab synergy with fenretinide and rhApo2L, prediction
of PD interactions with a broader range of anticancer agents
will require assessment of additional signaling components.
Finally, scaling between preclinical models and humans hinges
upon identifying and deconvolving system components versus
pharmacologic components (37); the two do not scale in the
same manner. The modular nature of the approach presented
here is supportive of translational research, but formidable
challenges remain in gleaning quantitative insights into human
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics from preclinical
data. Nevertheless, because the system modeling strategy
presented is dynamic in nature, exhaustive evaluation of

combination regimens is feasible by simulation and could
suggest optimized treatment schedules worthy of experimental evaluation. Approaches to multiscale integration of systems
pharmacology models are in their infancy, but with appropriate extension could suggest new therapeutic agents or identify
targets for combination drug development.
