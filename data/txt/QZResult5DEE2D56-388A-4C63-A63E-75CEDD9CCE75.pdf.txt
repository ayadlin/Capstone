ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in
the United States. Prostate cancer therapy is severely hampered by lack of response
and development of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in patients.
Therefore, the development and discovery of new drugs have become an urgent clinical
need. Interferons (IFNs), a family of pleiotropic cytokines, exert antitumor activities
due to their anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and proapoptotic functions. Here,
we report that pretreatment of prostate cancer PC-3 cells with IFNs sensitized these
cells to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)-induced apoptosis. The enhancement effect
of IFN treatment was dependent on IFN subtypes, in particular, IFN f. In comparison
with IFN α or β, IFN f treatment remarkably augmented apoptosis in PC-3 cells
induced with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthesized form of dsRNA.
We demonstrated that IFN-signaling was necessary for these effects by using mutant
cell lines. Transfection of 2–5A, the activator of RNase L, or silencing of dsRNAdependent protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA did not have any significant impact on this
event, suggesting that neither RNase L nor PKR was involved in poly I:C/IFN f-induced
apoptosis in the cells. Further investigation of the apoptotic pathway revealed that
Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2family, was synergistically up-regulated by
IFN f and poly I:C, whereas other members of the family were not affected. Knocking
down of Bak demonstrated its contribution to poly I:C/IFN f-induced apoptosis in the
cells.We believeour findings will precipitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies
for prostate cancer.

Treatment for prostate cancer depends on the
cancerous stage of the patient. For older patients with
slow growing tumors, watchful waiting may be suggested.
In the case of young patients and fast growing tumors,
the most common treatment is radical prostatectomy
and transurethral resection of the prostate. Radiation
therapy, a treatment with high-energy rays which kills
cancer cells, is applied as the first treatment for low-grade
cancer that has not spread outside the prostate gland or

INTRODUCTION
In developed countries, prostate cancer is the second
most frequently diagnosed cancer, which affects about one
in six men in the United States. Although preventative
steps such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening
and early detection have been undertaken to reduce the
mortality, it is nevertheless still the second leading cause
of cancer death in men [1].

Type I and Type II IFNs are able to effectively induce
apoptosis in a wide range of malignant cell types, such
as herpes-associated lymphomas, acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APL), non-small-cell lung cancer, nonmelanoma skin cancer and glioma [19]. IFNs have been
reported to induce cell apoptosis through the activation of
the death receptor cascade. The induction of TRAIL and/
or Fas/FasL in response to IFNs leads to recruitment and
activation of FADD. FADD activation, in turn, activates
caspase-8, initiating activation of the caspase cascade. On
the other hand, IFNs also induce caspase 4 and caspase-8.
Activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid, a proapoptotic member
of Bcl-2 family, resulting in disruption of mitochondrial
potential and the release of cytochrome C from the
mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Here, it acts as a cofactor
to stimulate the complexion of Apaf1 with caspase-9,
subsequently activating caspase-3. A variety of ISGs
including the members of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF)
family, dsRNA dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2–5A
dependent RNase L (RNase L), TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), promyelocytic leukemia gene
(PML) and the death associated proteins (DAPs) exert
their tumor suppressing functions through the induction
of apoptosis in tumor cells [19]. Interestingly, the
involvement of different ISGs in IFN-induced apoptosis
depends on cell types. For example, TRAIL and XIAP
associated factor 1(XAF1) are believed to contribute to
IFN-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, whereas an
induction of the regulators of IFN-induced death (RIDs)
is necessary in IFN-induced ovarian carcinoma cell
apoptosis [20–22]. Selective inhibition of one or more
apoptotic ISGs, or the acquisition of defects in IFNsignal transduction components increases the survival of
cancer cells.
In this study, we found that IFNs, especially
IFN  γ, enhanced the vulnerability of prostate cancer
cells to poly I:C-induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic
studies demonstrated that the IFN signaling pathway
was necessary for this event and poly I:C/IFN γ inducing
prostate cell apoptosis was partially through upregulating
the Bak expression. Our findings may provide insight for
a possible application in prostate cancer therapy.

has only spread to nearby tissue. Cryosurgery that freezes
the prostate cancer cells with cold metal probes can also
be used for prostate cancer without metastasis. However,
for men with metastatic disease, androgen-ablation
therapy termed as hormone therapy is the standard initial
treatment. This treatment decreases the level of androgen,
which compels prostate cancer shrink or delay growth.
Unfortunately, most patients eventually become resistant
to hormone therapy. Hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC) is a common condition that leads to significant
morbidity and mortality [2]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
has been considered as the best way to treat HRPC.
Docetaxel, a member of taxane compounds classified
as anti-microtubular agents, has become the first-line
chemotherapeutic drug for this disease [3, 4]. However,
lack of response and development of resistance to
docetaxel in a considerable number of patients limits its
applications in prostate cancer therapy [5, 6]. Therefore,
the development and discovery of new drugs capable of
prolonging survival of patients with prostate cancer have
become an urgent clinical need.
IFNs are a family of cytokines expressed in
eukaryotic cells as an early response to stimuli, such as
viral infections, dsRNA and immune inducers [7]. There
are two major classes of IFNs: Type I and type II. Type
I IFNs consist of several subtypes, mainly IFN α and
IFN β, and are induced in most cell types by viruses and
dsRNA. In contrast, type II IFN is induced potently in
T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells in response to
immune and inflammatory stimulation [8]. Most recently,
a new type of IFN-like protein has been identified and
classified as Type III IFN or IFN λ. Despite the differences
in their amino acid sequences, all three types of IFNs
display similar biological responses through the induction
of IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs) expression [9, 10].
IFN α is the first IFN used in the treatment of
cancer. Treatment with IFN α results in significant
clinical outcomes and prolongs survival of patients with
malignant hematological diseases, such as hairy cell
leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma [11, 12]. Furthermore,
clinical trials have demonstrated that IFN α also exerts its
therapeutic mechanisms against other tumor types, including
renal cell carcinoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and melanoma
[13]. Pre-clinical studies have shown that IFNs are able to
inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. For example IFN
β increases the expression of androgen receptors, improving
adhesion potential of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer
cells [14], while adenovirus-mediated delivery of IFN γ
gene can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro
and xenografts in vivo [15]. However, the role of IFNs in the
treatment of prostate cancer is understudied, particularly in
its clinical applications. The limited application is probably
due to the lack of efficacy and cytotoxicity in prostate
cancer patients [16–18].
The antitumor activity of IFNs is believed to be, at
least in part, through inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.

RESULTS
IFN γ and dsRNA synergistically decrease the
viability of PC-3 cells
The antiproliferative effect of IFNs has been well
established [7]. To determine the direct effect of IFNs on
prostate cancer cells, we treated PC-3 cells, a prostate
adenocarcinoma cell line, with and without IFN α, β or γ
and then determined the growth of the cells. Interestingly,
we found that IFN γ displayed an overt inhibitory effect
on PC-3 cells when compared with IFN α and β. In
39185

recent years, studies have revealed that a combination of
IFNs with cytotoxic compounds, such as paclitaxel and
thalidomide, augments the cytotoxicity for prostate cancer
cells and renal cell cancer in an additive manner [23, 24].
DsRNA is a side-product of viral infection, which is an
effective activator for several IFN-inducible enzymes,
and mediates the IFN action in antiviral infection and
anti-cellular proliferation. To determine the effect of
dsRNA on prostate cancer cells, we pre-treated PC-3 cells
with and without IFNs for 12 hours and incubated the
cells with poly I:C, a type of synthesized dsRNA, for 48
hours. Surprisingly, we found that only IFN γ and poly
I:C synergistically induced a remarkable inhibitory effect
on PC-3 cells as shown in Fig. 1A. IFN α, β, γ or poly I:C
alone only slightly suppressed the growth of PC-3 cells.
However, pre-treatment of these cells with individual
IFN, followed by poly I:C, significantly reduced the
cell viability. Specifically only about 10% cells survived
after pre-treated with IFN γ and incubated with poly I:C
for 48 hours. The cell morphological images could be
visible under an Olympus CKX31 microscope at 100
X magnification (Fig. 1B). To rule out any bias caused
by cell lines, we similarly treated DU145 cells, another
prostate cancer cell line, and obtained comparable results

(Fig. 1B and S1A). These results suggest that prostate
cancer cells primed with IFN γ are more vulnerable to poly
I:C-induced death. To determine the effect of a
combination of IFNs with poly I:C on other cell types, we
used the same method to treat H522 (human non-small
cell lung cancer), RCC45 (human renal cell carcinoma)
and SK-HEP-1 (human liver adenocarcinoma) cells.
Interestingly, the synergistic role of IFN was cell type
dependent. As shown in Fig. S1B–S1D, H522 and
Sk-Hep-1 cells were significantly sensitized to poly I:C
after the cells were primed with IFN α/β, not IFN γ, while
RCC45 cells could be primed by all three types of IFNs.

Poly I:C/IFN γ induces apoptosis in prostate
cancer cells
To determine if the inhibition of prostate cancer cell
growth resulted from apoptosis, an Annexin V assay was
performed to evaluate poly I:C/IFN γ-induced PC-3 cell
death. In this experiment, PC-3 cells were treated with and
without 1 μg/ml of poly I:C alone, or combined with 1,000
units/ml of IFN α, β or γ. After 24 hours of incubation, the
cells were subjected to an Annexin V assay. As shown in
Fig. 2A, 21% of PC-3 cells underwent apoptosis after poly

I:C/IFN γ treatment, whereas poly I:C alone, poly I:C/
IFN α and poly I:C/IFN β only resulted in 4.45%, 6.58%
and 6.31% apoptotic cells, respectively, suggesting that
poly I:C/IFN γ is a potent inducer of PC-3 cell apoptosis.
We also performed experiments to determine the dose
response and found that poly I:C at a concentration of
100 ng/ml and IFN γ at 50 units/ml were able to induce
a full response in these cells, suggesting their potential
in clinical application. However, WI-38 cells, a normal
human lung fibroblast cell line, and PrECs cells, a normal
prostate epithelial cell line, did not respond to the same
treatment. A significantly higher concentration of poly I:C
(>10 times) was needed to induce apoptosis in both types
of normal cells, indicating that poly I:C/IFN γ selectively
induces prostate cancer cell apoptosis (data not shown).
To further evaluate poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis in
PC-3 cells, DNA fragmentation in the cells after treatment
was examined. As shown in Fig. 2B, DNA fragmentation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was only observed in the cells treated with poly I:C/IFN γ,
confirming poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis.
To further demonstrate poly I:C/IFN γ induced
apoptosis, the cells after treatment were subjected to a
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay. As expected, the population
of apoptotic cells was nearly 4-fold higher in the cells
treated with poly I:C/IFN γ compared to the control
(Fig. 3A). We also evaluated the activity of caspase 3
in PC-3 cells after treatment with poly I:C/IFN γ. The
activity of caspase 3 in the cells treated with poly I:C/
IFN γ was examined by using a Caspase-GloTM 3/7
assay kit (Promega). IFN γ and poly I:C alone slightly
induced the activity of caspase 3 in PC-3 cells. However,
the synergistic role of IFN γ and poly I:C was evident.
Poly I:C/IFN γ induced an increase of caspase 3 activity
by about 3 folds (Fig. 3B). This observation was also
confirmed in DU145 cells (Fig. S2).

IFN signaling is necessary for poly I:C/IFN
γ-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells

PKR and RNase L is not involved in the event
DsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a serine/
threonine kinase induced in mouse and human cells by IFNs
and requires dsRNA for its activity. PKR displays a broad
range of biological activities including inhibition of cell
growth and induction of apoptosis [9]. To determine whether
PKR is involved in the apoptosis of PC-3 cells induced by
poly I:C/IFN γ, PKR in the cells were knocked down by
PKR siRNA (Fig. 5A) and apoptosis induced by poly I:C/
IFN γ was determined. PKR was not found to contribute to
poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells (Fig. 5D).
RNase L is a key enzyme in the 2–5A system of
IFN against virus and cell proliferation. 2′–5′ linked
oligoadenylates known as 2–5A, the activator of RNase L,
is synthesized by 2–5A synthetases requiring dsRNA for
their activities. The role of RNase L in cell apoptosis has
been well established [27]. To determine whether RNase
L is involved in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced prostate cancer
cell apoptosis, we first analyzed the expression of RNase

The gene expression mediated by IFNs is through the
activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. To determine if IFN
signaling is necessary for poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells, we used LNCaP cells to perform the
experiment. The LNCaP cell line is an altered prostate cancer
cell line deficient of JAK1, a key component in the JAK/
STAT pathway [25]. As we expected, LNCaP cells were
unresponsive to poly I:C/IFN γ in the same condition for
PC-3 cells as shown in Fig. 4A. However, the cells slightly
underwent apoptosis at a concentration of 25 μg/ml poly
I:C (data not shown), which may be caused by activation of
other pathways [26]. To further strengthen our finding, we
performed the same experiment by using U3A cells in which
STAT1 is mutated. A similar result was obtained (Fig. 4B).
Taken together, these results suggest that the JAK/STAT
pathway of IFNs is necessary for the synergistic effect of
poly I:C/IFN γ on prostate cancer cell apoptosis.

L in the cells treated with IFNs and individual IFN with
poly I:C. As shown in Fig. 4B, the level of RNase L in the
cells was not significantly changed, no matter if the cells
were treated with individual IFN alone or combined with
poly I:C. RNase L in the cells was knocked down by using
siRNA (Fig. 5C) and the cells were then treated with poly
I:C or IFN γ alone, or a combination of both. The cell
viability was not affected in the presence or absence of
RNase L (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that the 2–5A
system is not involved in this event.
It has been reported that death associated proteins
(DAPs) such as DAP-3 and 5 contributes to IFN γ-induced
apoptosis in different cell types [28]. To determine if DAPs
are the effectors in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells, we examined the expression of
DAP3 and 5 by Western blot analysis in the cells after IFN
γ treatment. The expression of DAP 3 and 5 was clearly
IFN γ independent (Fig. 5F) in PC-3 cells, suggesting the
DAP proteins may not be active in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced
apoptosis.

γ. As shown in Fig. 6F and 6G, knocking down of Bak
significantly reduced poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that Bak may be the key effector in this event.

DISCUSSION
There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat
patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).
Although clinical trials by using either IFN γ or poly
I:C alone have been initiated for treating several types
of cancer, the toxicity at high doses severely hindered
the outcomes [11, 12]. In this study, we report that a
combination of IFN γ with poly I:C was able to induce
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells at a significant lower
dose and Bak, a pro-apoptotic member in the Bcl-2
family, may be the effector in the event. Our results may
provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat patients
with HRPC.
Cancer therapy using a single drug is often not
sufficient to elicit a significant therapeutic response. Thus,
a combination of different therapeutic agents is becoming
one of the most common strategies used in oncology.
Preclinical data and clinical trials have demonstrated
that such a combination can enhance anti-tumor activity
of these compounds and decrease their toxicities. For
example, IFN α is combined with chemotherapeutic
drugs such as sorafenib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab
to treat renal cell carcinoma [31, 32]. Additionally, a
phase II trial indicates that a combination of 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), cisplatin and IFN α results in a high response rate
in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
[33]. Furthermore, a phase I/II clinical trial shows that
IFN γ can be used in combination with carboplatin and
paclitaxel as a safe and effective first-line treatment option
for ovarian cancer [34]. We expect that our strategy will
provide a novel treatment for prostate cancer.
RNas L and PKR are IFN-inducible proteins
mediating IFN functions against viral infection and cell
proliferation at the transcriptional and translational levels.
The activation of RNase L and PKR is dsRNA-dependent,
although the role of dsRNA in the RNase L function is
indirect. A line of evidence has shown that RNase L and
PKR play an important role in cell apoptosis as well [9].
PKR is clearly not involved in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced
apoptosis in prostate cancer cells since there was no
change in apoptotic cells after knocking down of PKR in
the cells. 2–5A is the activator of RNase L, which can be
produced by 2–5A synthetases, a family of IFN-induced
and dsRNA dependent enzymes. Transfection of 2–5A
into cells results in apoptosis in several cell types through
activation of RNase L [27]. Apoptosis is induced in PC-3
cells by 2–5A, but not in the cells in which RNase L was
knocked down [35]. However, poly I:C/IFN γ was able
to induce apoptosis at a similar extent in PC-3 cells with
or without RNase L, suggesting that RNase L does not
contribute to the event.

Bak partially contributes to poly I:C/IFN
γ-induced apoptosis
There are a variety of gene products involved in
the process of cell apoptosis. To explore if poly I:C/IFN
γ treatment impacts the expression of certain pro- or antiapoptotic proteins in the cells, we examined the level of
some members in the Bcl-2 family. As shown in Fig. 6A
and 6B, a combination of IFN γ and poly I:C had no
significant impact on the expression of Bax, Bad, Bim and
Bcl-2 in PC-3 cells. However, the treatment synergistically
enhanced the expression of Bak, a pro-apoptotic member
of the Bcl-2 family [29]. The significantly increased
Bak expression in DU145 was also observed upon the
treatment, although poly I:C/IFN γ was slightly enhanced
the level of Bak in PrECs cells, a normal prostate cell line
(Fig. 6C). Overtly, poly I:C/IFN γ induced the expression
of Bak at its transcriptional level (Fig. 6D). Bax is mainly
found in the cytosol. Upon apoptotic stimulation, Bax
undergoes a conformational shift and becomes organelle
membrane-associated, in particular, mitochondrial
membrane associated. To further demonstrate if Bax is
involved in the event, despite its unchanged level, we
performed immune staining to localize Bax in the cells
under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 6E, the
location of Bax in the cell was not obviously altered in the
presence or absence of these stimuli, confirming that Bax
did not contribute to poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis in
PC-3 cells.
Bak is a pro-apoptotic member in the Bcl-2 family,
which is also involved in a wide variety of cellular
activities [30]. To determine if the increased expression
of Bak plays a major role in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced
apoptosis, we first knocked it down by using siRNA in
PC-3 cells. The cells were then treated with poly I:C/IFN

The Jak-Stat pathway mediates the function of
IFNs [9]. Our results showed that the Jak-Stat pathway
is necessary for poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis, since
U3A cells in which STAT1 is mutated did not respond
to poly I:C/IFN γ. Furthermore, poly I:C/IFN γ at the
concentration we used was unable to induce apoptosis in
LNCaP cells, an altered prostate cancer cell line deficient
of JAK1. Interestingly, although all three types of IFN can
synergistically enhance apoptosis induced by poly I:C, the
effect is dependent on cell type. For example, H522 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sk-Hep-1 cells were significantly sensitized to poly I:C
after the cells were primed with IFN α/β, but not IFN γ,
despite the fact that IFN α functioned better in H522 cells
and IFN β was slightly more effective in Sk-Hep-1 cells,
and RCC45 cells could be primed by all three types of
IFNs (Fig. S1B–S1D). Hey1B cells, a human ovarian
cancer cell line, were similar to PC-3 cells under the same
condition (data not shown). These observations suggest
that either IFNs may induce certain specific proteins,
which play a distinctive role in dsRNA-induced apoptosis

across different cell types. Further investigation of these
mechanisms is warranted.
The Bcl-2 family plays an important role in
apoptosis. A line of evidence has shown that apoptosis
induced by IFN alone or combined with other agents is
associated with altered levels of Bcl-2 family members.
For example, IFN α2a induces apoptosis in OVCAR3
cells through Bak activation and translocation of AIF
from the mitochondria to the nucleus [29]. In addition,
IFN α with sorafenib together downregulates the
expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, resulting in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell apoptosis [36].
IFN γ also enhances apoptosis in macrophages under
trophic stress by upregulation of p53 and Bax, and
down regulation of Bcl-xl [37], while IFN γ combined
with TNF-α induces pancreatic β-cell apoptosis via
STAT1-mediated Bim activation [38]. Recently Riccioli
et al. reported that poly I:C alone with lipofectamine
was able to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
through activation of the TLR3/IRF3 pathway or PKC-α
[26, 39, 40]. In our study, Bak may be one of the major
contributors in poly I:C/IFN γ-induced apoptosis.

at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with ice cold PBS,
and then re-suspended in 1 × binding buffer, provided

FITC-Annexin V (5 μl) and propidium iodide (5 μl) were

200 μl of binding buffer. After incubation for 10 min at

through the use of glass fibers. DNA samples were
separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidine
bromide staining under UV light.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Caspase assays

Reagents and antibodies

The activity of caspase 3 in the cells treated with
poly I:C or IFN γ alone, or a combination of both, was
examined by using the Caspase-GloTM 3/7 reagent
(Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, cytosolic extracts
were prepared by suspending cell pellets in NP-40 lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2,
90  mM KCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 100 units/ml aprotinin,
10 μg/ml leupeptin and 2% NP-40). After centrifugation
at 10,000 g for 10 min, the cell extracts containing 40 μg
proteins were transferred into a 96-well plate to mix with
50 μl of the Caspase-Glo3/7 reagent. After incubation
for 1 hour at 37°C, caspase activity was then determined
by a fluorescent plate reader (Dynex Technologies,
Chantilly, VA).

Antibodies were purchased from different
companies: Bim, Bax, Tim23, PKR and the full length
of caspase 3 from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA);
β-actin, Tubulin, Bcl-2, Bad and Bak were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DAP3
and 5 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA). Human RNase L monoclonal antibody was
a gift from Dr. Robert Silverman (Cleveland Clinic, OH).

Cell culture and treatment
PC-3 human prostate cancer cells (ATCC, Manassas,
VA) were grown in RPMI-1640 (Core Facility, Cleveland
Clinic, Cleveland, OH) and supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Biosource, Camarillo, CA) as well as
antibiotics in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
The cells were grown to 90% confluence and incubated
with 1,000 units/mL of IFN α, IFN β and IFN γ (R & D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight, and transfected
with or without 1 μg/mL polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid
(poly I:C) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The cell viability was
analyzed by trypan blue exclusion assays.

TUNEL assay
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) dUTP
nick end labeling analysis (TUNEL) for DNA degradation
was performed using an apo-Brdu kit (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA). Cells after treatment were scraped using
a scraper with the media containing floating cells. Cells
were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stored
in 70% ethanol at –20°C until staining and analysis.
DNA fragmentation was examined by incorporating
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and stained with a labeled antibromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody. The total DNA
content was determined with propidium iodine, and the
labeled cells were sorted by using a FACScanTM (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NJ).

Annexin V assay
The Annexin V assay was performed using an
Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodine apoptosis detection
kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Briefly, the cells
treated with poly I:C alone or in combination with

Western blot analysis
After treatment, cells were washed twice with­
ice-cold PBS and collected with a scraper. The
cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above.
Proteins (100 μg per sample) were fractionated on a SDS10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to the PVDF
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane
was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing
0.02% sodium azide and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, and
incubated with different primary antibodies for 1 hour
at room temperature. The membrane was then washed
with PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated
with specific secondary antibodies conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling, Billerica, MA)
for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, proteins
were detected by a chemiluminescent method according
to the manufacturer’s specification (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

PC3 cells were plated onto 12-mm diameter round
glass cover slips in a six-well plate. After treatment,
cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with
3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37°C. Fixed cells
were rinsed in PBS, sequentially permeabilized with
0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min, and washed with
PBS at room temperature. After incubation for 60 min
in PBS/1% BSA, cells were washed in PBS/0.05%
Triton X-100 and incubated with optimal dilutions of
anti-Bax, anti-Tim23 primary antibodies and Hoechst
for 60 min at room temperature (primary antibody IgG
was diluted by PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA).
After three washes with PBS/0.05% Triton X-100, cells
were incubated with the secondary antibodies for 60 min
at room temperature: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50) and Phycoerythrin
(PE) conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200). Cells
were washed three times with PBS. Cells on cover
slips were mounted with a slow-fade, anti-fade reagent
onto glass slides and were observed under two-photon
microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).

Knockdown of PKR, RNase L and Bak
PC-3 cells were transfected with a heterogeneous
mixture of 21–23 bp siRNA that induces effective
silencing of PKR and RNase L by using a transpass R2
transfection reagent (New England Biolab, Ipswich,
MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were grown to 50% confluence. SiRNAs were incubated
with the transfection reagent in a serum-free medium for
20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture
was evenly dispersed onto the cells that have been washed
once with serum-free medium. The final concentration
of siRNAs was 12.5 nM. After incubation for 3 hours,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the complete culture medium was added to the cells.
The transfected cells were treated with IFN γ and poly
I:C after 30 hours as described previously. The apoptotic
effects of these treatments on the transfected PC-3 cells
were analyzed. The expression of Bak in PC-3 cells was
silenced by using a Bak siRNA (h) kit (sc-29786, Santa
Cruz) in accordance to the manufacturer’s instruction.
