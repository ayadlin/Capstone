ABSTRACT
Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the major water channel expressed in the central
nervous system and is primarily expressed in astrocytes. Recently, accumulated
evidence has pointed to AQP4 as a key molecule that could play a critical role in
glioma development. Discoveries of the role of AQP4 in cell migration suggest that
AQP4 could be a significant factor regarding glioma malignancies. However, the
AQP4 expression levels in glioma have not been fully elucidated; furthermore, the
correlation of AQP4 expression with glioma malignancy remains controversial. Here,
we review the expression pattern and predictive significance of AQP4 in malignant
glioma. The molecular mechanism of AQP4 as it pertains to the migration and invasion
of human glioma cells has been summarized. In addition, the important roles of
AQP4 in combating drug resistance as well as potential pharmacological blockers
of AQP4 have been systematically discussed. More research should be conducted to
elucidate the potential roles of AQP4 in malignant glioma for identifying the tumor
type, progression stages and optimal treatment strategies. The observed experimental
results strongly emphasize the importance of this topic for future investigations.

INTRODUCTION

tumor proliferation and angiogenesis [9]; however, the
mechanisms remain unclear.
Glioma is a frequently occurring malignant tumor
in the central nervous system (CNS). Glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant
type of brain tumors in adults. Most patients develop
clinical symptoms over a short time span (approximately
3 months) and often die within 8-18 months of diagnosis
[10]. Fewer than half the patients diagnosed with GBM
live for longer than 6 months, and the 2-year survival rate
is only 3% [11]. The global burden of malignant glioma
is expected to rise, and its diffuse and invasive growth
combined with its high frequency of recurrence are
associated with a poor prognosis [12-14]. Due to the poor
prognosis of these patients, new therapeutic approaches

To date, more than 13 water channel proteins
(AQP1-13) have been identified in multiple mammalian
species and appear to possess various regulatory functions
in a wide variety of diseases, including brain edema [13], hepatoencephalopathy [4], seizures [5-6] and brain
tumors [7]. AQP1, AQP4 and AQP9 have been clearly
identified as brain-specific; among them, AQP4 is
the most important family member that has been well
described as participating in brain edema and other
various brain diseases [8]. Intriguingly, a surprising link
between AQPs and cancer as emerged in recent years.
AQPs appear to play a key role in several tumor-related
processes, including tumor edema, tumor cell migration,

are urgently required. Current evidence has indicated that
compared to low-grade tumors or normal brain tissue,
high-grade tumors have up-regulated expression of AQP4,
which possibly contributes to cerebral edema [15, 16].
Other authors have associated AQP4 with the regulation
of human glioma cell migration and invasion [17, 18]. In
addition, various studies have confirmed the increased
expression of AQP4 in GBM, and the effects of downregulated AQP4 in inducing glioblastoma cell apoptosis
[19] have also been reported. All these data suggest the
involvement of AQP4 in malignant brain tumors and
indicated that AQP4 could serve as a potential target for
therapy of glioma.
Intriguingly, there are some discrepancies
regarding the role of AQP4 in malignant gliomas. Using
a pharmacological inhibitor and small-interfering RNA,
Ding et al. [17] demonstrated that knocking down AQP4
expression could result in specific and massively impaired
invasion and migration glioblastoma cells. The authors
also confirmed that AQP4 is involved in the control of
glioblastoma cell invasion and migration and could be
a potential therapeutic target to combat glioblastoma
cell infiltration. Aside from water transport, AQP4 has
been shown to contribute to the regulation, invasion and
migration of gliomas [17, 18]. Previously, McCoy et al.
[20] found that by stably reintroducing either AQP1 or
AQP4 into glioma cell lines, AQP4 could actually reduce
the migratory ability of the cell, which is inconsistent
with the results of the study performed by Ding et al.
[17, 18]. However, this may be due to their use of the
M23 splice variant of AQP4, which has been shown to
increase cell adhesiveness [21] rather than cell migration
and invasion. Another study by McCoy’s group revealed
that glioma cells expressing AQP4 showed significantly
reduced invasion abilities compared to tumors expressing
AQP1 as determined by quantitative stereology; these
results were consistent with the viewpoint regarding
the differential roles for AQP1 and AQP4 during tumor
progression [22]. These findings could serve as a basis in
unraveling the controversy and mystery of AQP4 function
in glioma. Accumulated evidence has pointed to AQP4
as a key molecule that plays an important role in glioma
development [23]; here, we review the potential roles of
AQP4 in malignant glioma (Figure 1).

astrocytes, which were frequently shown to express AQP4
and OAPs, could strictly control the maintenance of the
BBB [25, 26] by encompassing the vessels by sending an
end-foot toward the perivascular basal lamina [27]. During
brain development, an AQP4/OAP-related polarity (i.e.,
the ratio of OAP densities in end-foot versus non-endfoot membranes) is required for astrocytes, and this has
been demonstrated to be important for the induction and/
or maintenance of the BBB [28, 29]. Thus, it is assumed
that AQP4 in astrocytes may significantly contribute to
the aberrant function of the BBB in human glioblastoma.
Using freeze-fracture replicas and immunogold staining
against AQP4, Wolburg et al. [24] attempted to observe
the OAP expression profile in normal and glioblastoma
tissues from humans. They found that OAPs localize to
the parenchymal membrane domains (which are normally
absent in glioblastoma), whereas the high density observed
in the normal astroglial end-feet membranes disappear in
glioma cell membranes, including those in contact with
the basal lamina. Noell et al. [30] demonstrated that this
disrupted localization could be caused by the degradation
of the proteoglycan agrin; intriguingly, the presence of
agrin is indispensable for the formation of OAPs. Loss of
agrin may lead to AQP4 redistribution and compromised
directionality of water transport out of the cell, which can
destroy the BBB and cause brain edema [31]. The authors
also confirmed the important role of the dystrophindystroglycan complex (DDC) for the adequate expression
of AQP4 at the BBB [32], and these results were consistent
with those from a previous study conducted by Warth et al.
[33] who suggested that AQP4 is tightly associated with
the DDC and that agrin is indispensable for the polarized
distribution of AQP4 in astrocytes.
Wolburg et al. [24] also confirmed that in tumors,
the entire glioma cell shows strong AQP4 staining;
however, the overall density of the OAPs is not nearly as
high as that in the normal end-foot membrane, even near
vessels. Thus, it could be assumed that in glioma cells,
AQP4 might also exert activities independent of OAPs.
It has been reported that AQP4 could dissociate from
OAPs and redistribute across the entire surface of tumor
cells [30, 31, 32, 33]. Currently, the functional differences
between AQP4 within OAPs and standalone AQP4 still
require further research. Analysis of the composition of
freeze-fractured membranes from cells transfected with
the M23, M1 or a mixture of both M1 and M23 isoforms
of AQP4 has been conducted by Furman et al. [34].
Interestingly, only transfection with both isoforms resulted
in the formation of OAPs. Thus, specific up-regulation of
the M1 isoform in glioma might explain the interesting
phenomenon regarding up-regulated AQP4 in conjunction
with down-regulated OAPs.
However, a study by Noell et al. [35] presented
different results. In their experiments with human and
glioma tissue, they did not observe OAPs despite the
presence of both AQP4-M1 and AQP4-M23. This was

THE EXPRESSION PATTERN OF AQP4 IN
HUMAN GLIOMA TISSUE
The arrangement of AQP4 is morphologically
spectacular, as it forms orthogonal arrays of particles
(OAPs) that can be observed in freeze-fracture replicas. In
brain tumors, these OAPs are redistributed to membrane
domains apart from end-feet areas and are redistributed
across the entire surface of the cell [24]. Wolburg et al.
[24] reviewed the disruption of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) in human glioblastoma. It is now accepted that

completely unexpected because expression of both the
M1 and M23 isoforms of AQP4 should result in the
formation of OAPs. This raises the question of whether
the informative value of transfected cell lines could
translate to in vivo situations. More efforts should be
directed toward clarifying how in vitro culture conditions
affect AQP4 expression. Previously, McCoy et al. [20]
confirmed that all glioma patient biopsies express AQP1
and AQP4, with some samples showing expression of
AQP5; however, when isolated and grown as cell lines,
no AQP proteins could be detected except for AQP1 in a
small subset of cell lines. Noell et al. [35] also confirmed
the loss of AQP4 in primary human glioblastoma cell
cultures after a few passages. Interestingly, the authors
also indicated for the first time that AQP4-negative
glioma cells implanted in the animal brain or flank could
specifically express AQP4 in intracerebral gliomas but
neither extracranial nor flank gliomas had detectable
AQP4 expression. Thus, certain intracerebral factors may
be necessary for AQP4 expression. It is currently unclear
how the brain microenvironment affects AQP4 expression,
and more research should be conducted on this topic.

in the disturbance of the BBB and tumor-associated
edema [42, 43]. Interestingly, it was reported that after
cerebral hypoxia and BBB disruption, VEGF co-localizes
with AQP4 on astrocyte processes [44]. Moreover, an
intracerebral injection of VEGF profoundly up-regulated
AQP4 mRNA and protein levels in the perivascular space
and glia limitans externa [45]. Based on evidence that
VEGF is closely associated with AQP4 and that both
molecules are essential to brain edema, it is speculated
that the effect of VEGF on brain edema may result from
its regulation of AQP4 expression. Furthermore, Chu et
al. [46] demonstrated that VEGF may regulate AQP4
expression by activating MAPK pathways. VEGF can
induce angiogenesis, and AQP4 and VEGF likely act in
concert during the process of tumor-associated edema
formation [47]. Thus, AQP4 expression could also affect
angiogenesis, which is directly related to the incidence
of edema. All these pathways could cause brain edema
in glioma, and improved understanding of the molecular
determinants underlying edema formation is a prerequisite
for developing novel therapeutic agents with anti-edema
and anti-tumor activity.
In addition, a correlation between increased BBB
permeability and elevated AQP4 levels has been observed
[15], and AQP4 up-regulation is also associated with brain
edema formation in malignant gliomas [48]. Therefore,
AQP4 could be regarded as a protective factor for the
reduction of cerebral fluid accumulation in human gliomas,
and a correlation between the degree of peritumoral edema
and the expression level of AQP4 in peritumor could exist
[23]. It is assumed that AQP4 expression levels could
correlate to the tumor grade, with the generally accepted
viewpoint that AQP4 expression increases with higher
glioma grades [23]. A recent study by Zhao et al. [49]
found weak positivity of AQP4 expression surrounding
the capillary vessel in low-grade human glioma tissues,
whereas in higher grade samples, the distribution of
AQP4 was not confined to membranes contacting the
basal laminae, which is involved in the construction of
the BBB. This further confirms previous reports regarding
the redistribution of AQP4 with the increase of the glioma
grade. Thus, AQP4 and its redistribution might also be
grade-dependent. One publication suggested that AQP4
could be used as a diagnostic marker to distinguish
oligodendroglial and astrocytic tumors [50]. Similarly,
another report [48] implied that AQP4 might be used to
distinguish different WHO grades of astroglial tumors.
Warth et al. [48] investigated 189 primary gliomas
of WHO grade I-IV along with 31 recurring glioblastoma
tumors to obtain a more in-depth understanding regarding
the role of AQP4 in human brain tumor edema and, more
importantly, to explore whether a direct association
between AQP4 expression levels and mortality could
be found. Unfortunately, similar overall survival was
found among patients with low, medium, and high
AQP4 expression within each WHO group. Although the

AQP4 MAY BE A MARKER FOR THE
DIAGNOSIS AND PROGRESSION OF
HUMAN MALIGNANT GLIOMA
Recent studies have called special attention to AQPs
as potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers [36].
AQP4, which is the water channel with by far the highest
water flux capacity in the brain, has been found to be
strongly up-regulated and redistributed across the entire
surface of all glial tumor cells [15, 16, 24, 30, 33, 37] as
mentioned above. The redistribution and the displaced
insertion of AQP4 molecules, which are a consequence of
severe alterations of the microenvironment, are part of a
set of stereotypical responses leading to the most serious
clinical signs of glioblastoma—brain edema [38]. Tumorassociated edema significantly contributes to the mass
effects of glioma and neurological deterioration. In recent
decades, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading
to the development of edema have been characterized
in a stepwise manner [39]. It is generally accepted that
tumor-related edema is considered vasogenic, i.e.,
disturbed BBB function resulting in increased vascular
permeability. The altered vascular architecture in brain
tumors results in the loss of barrier function and allows
plasma fluid and proteins to leak into the surrounding
tissue [40]. In addition, other factors that could cause
BBB dysfunction might actually be the source of tumorassociated edema. For example, tumor cells typically
produce various cytokines that act on endothelial cells
located within or around the tumor microenvironment,
and the most important cytokine secreted by various brain
tumors is VEGF [41]. Under the influence of VEGF, the
permeability of the endothelium is increased, resulting

authors did not see an association of AQP4 expression
and survival time among any of the WHO groups, they
demonstrated that AQP4 up-regulation and redistribution
could serve as a tumor progression marker in WHO grade
II-IV astrocytomas, whereas unexpectedly high AQP4
expression levels were observed in WHO grade I pilocytic
astrocytomas [48].
The authors additionally conducted an analysis
regarding the comparison between AQP4 expression
in glioblastoma centers and corresponding infiltration
zones to identify whether different AQP4 levels between
the tumor core and the infiltration zones are correlated
to patient survival [48]. Compared to the results from a
study performed by Mou et al. [23], who reported that
AQP4 expression was higher in the peritumor than that in
the tumor, Warth and colleagues unexpectedly observed
significantly higher AQP4 expression levels within
the tumor center than that observed in the peritumor,
suggesting that the alterations in the AQP4 expression
pattern are specific to neoplastic cells and are therefore
irrelevant to counteracting the ability to prevent edema
formation in tumor infiltration zones. Despite this
controversy, comparisons between the tumor center and
perifocal infiltration zone regarding AQP4 expression
levels might be the key to clarifying the role of the AQP4
expression profile in predicting tumor progression. The
redistribution of AQP4 and OAPs could be observed in
the infiltration zone around the tumor proper in which the
neurovascular unit appeared normal and histologically
unaltered regarding the morphology [38]. This suggests
that the redistribution of water channels is one of the
earliest indicators of glioma transformation. Furthermore,
compared to primary tumors, recurrent glioblastoma
tumors did not appear to exhibit significant differences
in their AQP4 expression levels [48]. However, these
ﬁndings should be interpreted with caution given the small
samples, but this is a very interesting topic that warrants
more exploration.

expression at the leading edge of an invading cell possibly
serving this role [22]. Furthermore, the authors indicated
that AQP4 localizes to the leading edge of the invadopodia
of migrating cells and co-localizes with CLC2 and KCC1,
which could be the mechanism by which Cl- and K+
are released during cell migration [53]. This provides
further support for the role of KCl-water extrusion as an
enhancer of cell invasion. To date, several studies have
demonstrated AQP4-mediated migration [51, 54, 55, 56],
but the mechanisms of the extent of AQP4 involvement in
malignant glioma still requires more research.
The invasion of malignant glioma is a complex
process most likely controlled by different genes and
signaling pathways at multiple steps: reduced adhesion
between tumor cells and other surrounding cells, increased
tumor cell mobility, and degradation of the extracellular
matrix [57]. Currently, the effect of AQP4 in promoting
glioma cell migration and invasion can be summarized
by the results of several key studies. First, the formation
and retraction of cell membrane protrusions at the leading
edge of glioma cells are essential for the migration and
invasion of gliomas [58]. Interestingly, AQP4 polarizes to
the lamellipodia and induces an increase in the number
and/or size of lamellipodia in migrating cells, where there
is rapid transmembrane water movement [55, 59]. This
is consistent with reports indicating that ion channels
and transporters could exert important effects on cell
migration by polarizing the leading edge of migrating
cells. The movement of these ions might contribute to
an osmotic gradient that drives water influx during cell
movement [60]. Second, AQP4 might be involved in
cytoskeletal organization. A recent study has indicated
that AQP4 deficiency in rat and human cells could be
associated with actin depolymerization well as with a
dramatic change of morphology: in astrocytes from AQP4
knockout mice, the F-actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in
the cortical layer of the brain was completely replaced by
fibers with a star-like organization [61]. Moreover, AQP4
could interact with α-syntrophin, which is a member of
the DDC. This complex includes dystrophin and utrophin,
linker molecules between the actin cytoskeleton and
β-dystroglycan (β-DG) [33]. These findings strongly
indicate the involvement of AQP4 protein in altering
the cellular cytoskeleton in a manner that could play the
decisive role in cell migration. Third, cell-cell adhesion
determines cell polarity and could be generally reduced
in human cancers. It is known that reduced intercellular
adhesion promotes cell invasion, which is an essential step
in the progression from localized primary malignancy to
metastatic disease. The maintenance and control of normal
intercellular adhesion is often regulated by the cadherincatenin cell adhesion complex [18]; specifically, connexin
43 could be critical in calcium-dependent intercellular
adhesion events [62] and is commonly overexpressed in
certain types of cancer. For example, β-catenin binds the
cytoplasmic domain of the cadherin adhesion receptors

AQP4

REGULATE
THE
MIGRATION AND INVASION OF HUMAN
GLIOMA CELLS
It has been postulated that the AQP4 expression
levels are relevant to the migration of astrocytes [51],
indicating an enabling role of AQP4 in the infiltration
of malignant glioblastoma cells. This may indicate that
inhibiting AQP4 expression can limit infiltration. McCoy
et al. [22] hypothesized that the invasive migration of
glioma cells requires changes in cell volume; specifically,
cell shrinkage to allow invasion through narrow
extracellular spaces in the brain [52]. In addition, McCoy
et al. [20] previously showed AQP4 localization at the
leading edge of migrating tumor cells; thus, we could
assume that water release is required to achieve any
volume change in the process of cell migration, with AQP4

as well as with actin to bridge the extracellular adhesive
activity of cadherins with the underlying actin cytoskeleton
[63]. Dysregulation of these proteins can result in the loss
of cell-cell adhesions. Nicchia et al. reported the possible
novel roles of AQP4 and its functional relationship with
connexin 43 regarding the cytoskeleton in astrocytes
from AQP4 knockout mouse; these data could indicate a
functional relationship between water channels and gap
junctions in brain [61]. Thus, AQP4 could likely regulate
glioma adhesion via adhesion-associated proteins such as
connexin 43.
As mentioned above, aside from water transport,
other potential roles of AQP4 in the regulation, invasion
and migration of gliomas have been slowly elucidated.
These properties of AQP4 appear unrelated to the
canonical and well-established role of AQP4 in edema
formation and absorption, suggesting this protein as novel
therapeutic target for treating brain tumors [2, 64].

as the only established brain phenotype. In contrast to
the study by Zhou et al. [65], Saadoun et al. [66] also
indicated that AQP4 deletion in mice might not alter brain
characteristics, including BBB permeability. However,
they used the San Francisco AQP4 knockout mice rather
than the Nanjing AQP4 knockoutmice. Furthermore,
Eilert-Olsen et al. [67] also demonstrated that deletion
of AQP4 did not alter the ultrastructures of capillary
endothelial cells, the expression of tight junction proteins
or the vascular permeability to either HRP or Evans
blue albumin dye. The authors concluded that AQP4
deletion could reduce the expression of perivascular glial
scaffolding proteins without affecting the endothelial
barrier. Their results were obtained in C57BL/6J mice and
agree with those obtained in CD1 mice by Saadoun et al.
but contrast those of Zhou et al., who also used the CD1
mice. Notably, a study by Feng et al. [3] failed to replicate
the BBB dysfunction in the same mouse strain used by
Zhou et al. More research should be directed toward
clarifying this controversy, as AQP4-related functional
changes of the BBB might be a potential new target for
combating drug-resistant brain tumors and other CNS
diseases that involve BBB dysfunction.
In addition, AQP4 might impact drug resistance
through the ion transporter Na+/K+-ATPase. It is known
that decreasing the migratory ability of glioma cells is a
potential means of overcoming resistance, and involvement
of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the migration and proliferation of
glioma cells has been previously confirmed [68]. It has
also been emphasized that a decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase
activity could be used to combat apoptosis-resistant
malignant gliomas. Furthermore, specific inhibition
of Na+/K+-ATPase activity could disorganize the actin
cytoskeleton (thus reducing motility and proliferation)
and induce autophagy in malignant glioma models [69].
A study conducted by Thrane et al. [70] provided the first
line of evidence that AQP4 could impact the oxygenation
of brain tissue. The authors demonstrated that K+ uptake is
suppressed in AQP4 knockout mice because of decreased
oxygen delivery to tissue located farthest away from
a vascular oxygen source. This finding could expedite
research regarding Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition via AQP-4
mediated regulation of an ion imbalance. Thus, inhibiting
oxygen delivery in AQP4-deficient cells may represent
another important factor in regulating Na+/K+-ATPase
activity and ultimately drug resistance.

AQP4 MIGHT BE A SIGNIFICANT
CONTRIBUTOR TO BBB INTEGRITY AND
DRUG RESISTANCE
There are various controversies that should be
discussed. Because disrupting the BBB is an important
pathophysiological change during the progression
of glioblastoma and could play a critical role in the
development of drug resistance in the treatment process,
the roles of AQP4 in the BBB is an especially contentious
issue. Zhou et al. [65] found that altered ultrastructures
of brain microvessels, including open tight junctions and
swollen perivascular astrocytic end-feet, were frequently
observed in AQP4 knockout mice. The authors suggested
that AQP4 is essential for maintaining BBB integrity,
and reduced or absent expression could cause severe
alterations in the function of endothelial and astroglial
cells in the BBB. Because the BBB plays an important
role in drug resistance during glioma chemotherapy,
combating the resistance by targeting the BBB has become
a heated topic that warrants more research. AQP4 might
be an appropriate focal point; however, although a study
conducted by Zhou et al. clearly showed that AQP4
deletion impaired tight junctions and BBB permeability,
AQP4 knockout mice did not exhibit gross anatomic
abnormalities. Disruption of the BBB as described in their
Nanjing AQP4 knockout mice is severe [65], and their
paper indicated that the BBB in AQP4 knockout mice is
highly permeable to large molecules such as horseradish
peroxidase (HRP). In contrast, when Saadoun et al. [66]
investigated BBB permeability in the same Nanjing AQP4
knockout mice using the Evans Blue dye technique, they
actually found no difference in BBB permeability between
the WT and AQP4 knockout mice, which suggests that
technical artifacts may have influenced the data reported
by Zhou et al. and that compared to WT mice, AQP4
knockout mice present an expanded extracellular space

distinguishing features could also be important. The role of
AQP4 in human cancer has emerged as an area of intense
research interest. Aquaporin inhibitors may therefore
be a novel class of anti-tumor agents. Unfortunately,
no such inhibitors are available to date, and attempts to
produce small molecule inhibitors targeting aquaporins
have been largely unsuccessful [9]. Specifically, there is
no widely accepted specific AQP4 inhibitor. Screening
for specific inhibitors of AQP4 may illuminate the
design of novel mechanism-based therapies for glioma
and further elucidate this important biological aspect of
glioma progression. Thus, we will review potential AQP4
inhibitors that could serve as a basis for increased research
interest and warrant more detailed exploration.

2-(Nicotinamide)-1,3,4-thiadiazole
(TGN-020)
is a low molecular weight compound that has recently
been identified as an inhibitor of AQP4 [71]. The authors
showed that TGN-020 could reduce ischemic cerebral
edema in vivo [72]. However, there is no information
regarding the influence of putative inhibitors on the M1
and M23 isoforms of AQP4, and no information regarding
the association between inhibition of water transport and
inhibition of tumor cell migration exists [73].
Propofol (2,6-dilsopropylphenol), an IV anesthetic
commonly used in clinical practice, has been previously
proven to influence neuronal apoptosis [74] and reduce
AQP expression and brain edema in animal models [75].
Yang et al. [76] found that propofol could inhibit AQP4

Figure 1: The new potential roles of AQP4 in glioma. Under tumor conditions, AQP4 is dissociated from the orthogonal arrays

of particles (OAPs) and is redistributed across the entire surface of the glioma cell. AQP4 expression levels could significantly correlate
to the tumor grade, and it is generally accepted that AQP4 expression levels increase with higher glioma grades. More importantly, the
redistribution of AQP4 and OAPs could be one of the earliest indicators of glioma transformation. However, the facilitating role of AQP4
in the infiltration and invasion of malignant cells in glioblastoma requires additional research. First, the localization of AQP4 to the leading
edge of migrating tumor cells could provide evidence that water release is required to achieve any volume change during the process of
cell migration, with AQP4 at the leading edge of the invading cell possibly serving this role. More importantly, AQP4 might be involved in
cytoskeleton organization by affecting the actin cytoskeleton, β-dystroglycan (β-DG), α-syntrophin, dystrophin and/or utrophin. In addition,
AQP4 may impact the control and maintenance of normal intercellular adhesion, which could be an essential step in the progression from
a localized malignancy to metastatic disease, by interacting with adhesion-associated proteins.

expression. Currently, there are few studies that clinically
connected to the action of propofol and AQP activity, and
the mechanism of propofol on inhibiting AQP4 remains
unclear.
An article published by Gunnarson et al. [77] has
shown that protein kinase C (PKC) may be one of the
potential kinases that targets AQP4 and influences the
water permeability. Kleindienst et al. [78] also reported
that PKC activators could inhibit ischemia-induced
elevation of AQP4 expression in an animal model. PKCmediated phosphorylation could be the target for many
of the general anesthetic effects observed in the CNS,
including propofol as mentioned above [79]. However,
PKC activators might be too ubiquitous for use in humans.
Tetraethylammonium (TEA) has been indicated
to inhibit water permeability of AQP4 in transfected
oocytes [80] and has also been suggested to decrease
water permeability in primary mouse astrocyte cultures
[81]. Unfortunately, TEA is known to affect multiple ion
transporters and has been shown to considerably change
the electrochemical properties of cellular membranes [82].
Arylsulfonamides are a class of compounds that have
shown promise for the development of pharmacological
agents targeting AQPs [83]. Sulfonamides, including
the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, could
significantly reduce AQP4 activity [84].
The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide and
anti-epileptic drugs such as topiramate and zonisamide
[85] have been reported to inhibit ectopically expressed
AQP4 in Xenopus oocytes [84] as well as purified AQP4
reconstituted in liposomes [86]; however, other groups
have been unable to confirm this activity using AQP4transfected thyroid epithelial cells and primary glial
cultures [87].
Bumetanide is known as a loop diuretic drug that
inhibits the NKCC cotransporter in the ascending limb of
the loop of Henle in the kidneys [88] and was selected as
the structural scaffold for designing a chemical library of
derivatives based on its small but significant blockade of
AQP4 water channel function [89]. Bumetanide as well
as its derivatives were shown to inhibit AQP4 in Xenopus
oocytes.
As stated above, there are several reports of AQP4
inhibitors (including acetazolamide, anti-epileptic drugs,
bumetanide, thiadiazole and others); unfortunately, followup studies of these compounds by other investigators
using different assays have failed to confirm AQP4
inhibition. For a detailed discussion on the issues related
to the discovery of AQP inhibitors, please refer to the
recent review by Verkman et al. [90]. One interesting
development is the identification of an autoantibody
against AQP4 produced in patients with an inflammatory
demyelinating disease of the CNS known as neuromyelitis
optica; this antibody is referred to as AQP4-IgG or NMOIgG [91]. Monoclonal AQP4-IgG has been successfully
produced artificially [92], and linking AQP4-IgG to a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

toxin could be delivery system for destroying glioblastoma
cells, most of which express high levels of AQP4. Thus,
AQP4-IgG has the potential to become widely available
and specifically engineered to kill AQP4-overexpressing
cells in patients with malignant glioblastoma.
It is believed that identifying specific AQP4selective inhibitors is currently a high priority in ongoing
research. With an increasing number of novel compounds
being tested, it is possible to begin elucidating a role of
AQP blockers in mitigating pathologies such as brain
oedema, glioblastoma, and breast and colon cancers as
well as many other clinically important disorders [83].
Hopefully, improved chemotherapeutic targeting of AQP4
will be available to patients with malignant glioma in the
near future.

CONCLUSIONS
AQP4 is dissociated from the OAPs and
redistributes across the entire surface of glioma cells
under tumor conditions. AQP4 expression levels could
correlate to the tumor grade, as AQP4 expression levels
increase with higher glioma grades. More importantly,
the redistribution of AQP4 and OAPs could be one of the
earliest indicators of glioma transformation. However, the
facilitating role of AQP4 in the infiltration and invasion
of malignant glioblastoma cells requires additional
research. Furthermore, the important roles of AQP4 in
preventing drug resistance during glioma chemotherapy
and of potential novel pharmacological blockers of
AQP4 have been elucidated. We should be aware of the
various unresolved questions regarding AQP4 in human
glioblastoma. Further discovery of the dynamics of OAPs
and AQP4 molecules in tumor may be critical to gain
insight into the potential role of AQP4 in malignant glioma
regarding the prevention, treatment, and classification
of the tumor type and progression stages. Although
the observations summarized in this review should be
confirmed with more studies, we believe that they could
provide critical information for the design of more focused
research that will allow for systematic and definitive
evaluation of the role of AQP4 in glioma treatments.
More effort should be directed toward clarifying the newly
discovered functions and molecular mechanisms of AQP4
in malignant gliomas.
