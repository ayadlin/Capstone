Abstract
Although most patients with small-cell lung cancer respond to chemotherapy, the survival time is highly
diverse. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine whether germline genetic variations are prognostic
factors in small-cell lung cancer patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen. Genome-wide scan of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was performed using blood DNA to identify genotypes associated with
overall survival in 245 patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, and the results were replicated in
another independent set of 305 patients. Associations were estimated by Cox models and function of the variants
was examined by biochemical assays. We found that rs1820453 T>G SNP within the promoter region of YAP1 on
chromosome 11q22 and rs716274 A>G SNP in the region of downstream of DYNC2H1 on chromosome 11q22.3
are associated with small-cell lung cancer survival. In pooled analysis of 2 independent cohorts, the adjusted
hazard ratio for patients with the rs1820453 TG or GG genotype was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.19–1.85; P ¼ 0.0004) and 1.65
(95% CI, 1.36–2.01; P ¼ 4.76  107), respectively, compared with the TT genotype; and for patients with the
rs716274 AG or GG genotype was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.47–2.29; P ¼ 8.74  108) and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.90–4.62; P ¼ 1.59 
106), respectively, compared with the AA genotype. Functional analysis showed that the rs1820453 T>G change
creates a transcriptional factor binding site and results in downregulation of YAP1 expression. These results
suggest that YAP1 may play an important role in prognosis of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9721–9. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths all
over the world, is classified as small-cell lung cancer and nonsmall-cell lung cancer, with the latter occurring more frequently than the former. However, small-cell lung cancer,
which accounts for 20% of total lung cancer, is a very
aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by high
growth rate, rapid doubling time, propensity for the early
development of widespread metastases, and poor prognosis
(1–5). Although most patients with small-cell lung cancer
respond to chemotherapy such as the standard first-line platinum-based drugs, the survival time among patients given the
same regimen is highly diverse. Identification of prognostic

factors is among the many steps toward personalized medicine, which stands to have a profound impact on the clinical
care of cancer patients (6). Individual clinical characteristics
including age, smoking history, and disease stage may affect
prognosis of small-cell lung cancer patients (7), however, these
clinical characteristics can only explain in small part the great
heterogeneity of patient's survival, indicating that there might
be other factors determining disease prognosis.
In the recent years, evidence has been accumulated to show
that genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in both tumor and host genomes are associated
with patient's survival. Screening for such variants at a genome-wide level is now possible due to advances in highthroughput genotyping methodology, and a few genome-wide
association studies on complex diseases and survival of
patients have been reported (8–10). However, to the best of
our knowledge, no genome-wide association study on smallcell lung cancer survival has so far been reported.
Here we report a genome-wide study on the association
between germline genetic variations and survival of small-cell
lung cancer.

Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing) between July
2000 and June 2008 (11). The replication phase included 305
patients with small-cell lung cancer who were recruited at
Cancer Hospital of Jiangsu Province, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University and Nanjing Thoracic
Hospital (Nanjing), and 4 tertiary referral hospitals at Wuhan
city, Hubei Province (Wuhan) between March 2002 and March
2008. All patients were ethnic Han Chinese. To be included in
this study, all patients had to have cytologically confirmed
small-cell lung cancer and received the first-line carboplatin
(AUC 5–6, day 1) or cisplatin (60–80 mg/M2, day 1) plus
etoposide (100 mg/M2, days 1–3) chemotherapy for at least
2 cycles. According to the Veterans’ Administration Lung
Study Group, all patients were classified as having limited
disease or extensive disease on the basis of the results of a
physical examination; computed tomography scan of the
chest, liver, and adrenal glands; a magnetic resonance imaging
scan or computed tomography scan of the head; and a bone
scan. All patients tolerated chemotherapy as defined by a
Karnofsky performance score of at least 70, a life expectancy of
at least 3 months, and having adequate organ function. Overall
survival time of patients was measured from the date of
treatment to the date of last follow-up or death. Whether
and when a patient had died was obtained from inpatient and
outpatient records, patients’ families, or local Public Security
Census Register Office through follow-up telephone calls. The
last date of follow-up was 30th June 2009 and no patients were
lost to follow-up. Patients alive on the last follow-up date were
considered censored. The median follow-up time was
19 months for patients in the discovery cohort and 23 months
for patients in the replication cohort. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and this study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Institute, Nanjing Medical University, and Huazhong University of Science and
Technology Tongji Medical College.
Genotyping and quality control
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of each patient using a commercial Flexi Gene DNA
extraction kit (Qiagen). A total of 440,093 SNPs were genotyped for 245 DNAs isolated from each patient recruited at
Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (11)
using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 5.0 set (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer's instructions. We carried out
systematic quality control on the raw genotyping data. No
DNA sample failed to be genotyped because each individual
had <10% of missing genotypes. No individuals were excluded
for showing gender discrepancies based on their chromosome
X genotypes. SNPs were excluded by the following step-wise
procedure: (1) 9,771 SNPs were not mapped on autosomal
chromosomes, (2) 17,426 SNPs had a call rate of <95%, (3)
146,843 SNPs had a minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.1 (the
reason we chose this rigorous threshold was because this
study sought to identify potential SNPs that can be used as
prognostic biomarkers in clinics), and (4) 57 SNPs were
excluded as the genotype distributions clearly deviated from
that expected by Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square

>50, P < 5  1012). After these quality control steps, the
median sample call rate was 99.5% and a total of 265,996 SNPs
were used in analysis of the discovery phase. In the replication
phase, we used the MassArray system (Sequenom) to genotype
the top 26 SNPs, which were selected from the discovery phase
as tagSNPs when the r2 is 0.8 based on the pair-wise linkage
disequilibrium analysis using Haploview software (Version 4.4;
http//www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview).
Functional analysis of genetic variants
In the present study, we identified 3 significant SNPs,
rs10895256, rs1820453, and rs716274. Because rs716274 is
located in gene desert, functional studies were performed
only for rs10895256 and rs1820453, which lie in the 50 flanking
region of YAP1. For electrophoretic mobility-shift assays,
synthetic double-stranded and 30 biotin-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the rs10895256 G/T or rs1820453 G/T
sequences and H446 (human small-cell lung cancer cell line)
nuclear extracts were incubated at room temperature for 20
minutes using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit
(Pierce). The reaction mixture was separated on 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the products were detected
by Stabilized Streptavidin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate
(Pierce). For competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides at
10-fold or 100-fold molar excess were added to the reaction
mixture before the addition of biotin-labeled probes.
For luciferase reporter gene assays, a 1,528-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the YAP1 50 -untranslated region and
50 -flanking region and containing the T allele at 875 position
relative to the transcriptional start site (rs1820453T allele) was
generated by polymerase chain reaction (primers are available
upon request) and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic vector
(Promega), and the resultant plasmid was designated as pT. The p-T construct was then site-specifically mutated to
create the p-G construct, which contains the G at 875
position (rs1820453G allele). These 2 constructs used in this
study were restriction mapped and sequenced to confirm their
authenticity. We seeded 5  105 H446 cells per well in 48-well
plates and transfected them with an empty pGL3-Basic vector
(a promoterless control), p-T or p-G construct. pRL-SV40
plasmid (Promega) was cotransfected as a normalizing control. All transfections were carried out in triplicate. After 48
hours, cells were collected and analyzed for the luciferase
activity with a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Analysis of YAP1 RNA
Total RNA was isolated from surgically removed normal
lung tissues adjacent to tumors of 56 patients with small-cell
lung cancer and then converted to cDNA using oligo (dT)15
primer and Superscipt II (Invitrogen). YAP1 RNA was
measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction in triplicate using the ABI
7900HT Real-Time PCR system based on the SYBR-Green
method. The measurement of individual YAP1 RNA expression was calculated relative to that of GAPDH expression
using a modification of the method described by Lehmann
and Kreipe (12). The primers used for detecting YAP1

YAP1 Variants and Small-Cell Lung Cancer Survival

RNA are 50 -GGCGCTCTTCAACGCCGTCATGAAC-30 and 50 CCTGTCGGGAGTGGGATTT-30 .
Statistical analysis
For each of the selected 265,996 SNPs, Cox regression under
a log-additive genetic model was performed using 245 smallcell lung cancer patients recruited in Beijing with adjustment
for covariates that might influence patients’ survival, including age, sex, disease stage, and smoking status. The top 26
SNPs with P < 104 were advanced to replication in patients
independently recruited from Nanjing and Wuhan. The same
Cox models were used to analyze each of these 26 SNPs and
Bonferroni correction was performed to correct the P value of
single-locus results for the 26 testing. Hazard ratios (HR) and
their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Kaplan–
Meier survival estimates were plotted and P values were
assessed using log-rank tests. The survival package in R
was used to perform the analyses of lung cancer-related death.
Student's t test was used to examine the differences in
luciferase reporter gene expression and Mann–Whitney Utest was used to assess differences in YAP1 transcript abundance with different genotypes. All statistical tests were
carried out in a 2-sided manner.

Results
Patient characteristics
The characteristics of small-cell lung cancer patients in
the discovery and replication cohorts are shown in Table 1.
In the discovery cohort, 186 (75.9%) patients died of the
cancer but 59 (24.1%) patients had still survived until June
2009. Among the patients in the replication cohort, 191

(62.6%) died of the cancer but 114 (37.4%) had still survived.
There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex,
and smoking history in patients between the discovery and
replication cohorts. However, the proportion of patients
with limited disease was higher in the replication cohort
(31.8%) than in the discovery cohort (16.7%). Among
the select characteristics, only tumor stage showed significant association with patients’ survival, with the median
overall survival time of 31 months (95% CI, 24–39) for
limited disease and 19 moths (95% CI, 17–21) for extensive
disease.
Genetic variants associated with patient survival
We found that only rs716274 SNP was significantly associated with overall survival using Cox models assuming the
additive mode and adjusting for age, sex, disease stage, and
smoking status after Bonferroni correction (P ¼ 1.32  107).
Because our sample size in the discovery cohort is relatively
small and the statistical power might be limited, we therefore
selected all top SNPs that had P < 104 for replication (Table 2).
Because some of these top SNPs are located in the same
genomic regions and are in strong linkage disequilibrium, we
were able to select tagSNPs to represent each region in tests
for an independent association. According to the linkage
disequilibrium analysis on the basis of r2  0.8, 26 SNPs or
tagSNPs were finally selected for validation in the replication cohort of 305 small-cell lung cancer patients. Among the
26 SNPs, 2 SNPs (rs10895256 G>T and rs716274 A>G) were
confirmed to be significantly associated with overall
survival of small-cell lung cancer patients in the replication
cohort using Cox models adjusting for covariates (both P <
0.002 after Bonferroni correction; Supplementary Table 1). The

15–19) and 14 months (95% CI, 13–16), respectively (Fig. 1B).
Patients with the rs716274 AG (HR ¼ 1.83, 95% CI, 1.47–2.29;
P ¼ 8.74  108) or GG (HR ¼ 2.96, 95% CI, 1.90–4.62; P ¼ 1.59 
106) genotype had an increased risk of death compared with

Identification of other variant in YAP1 promoter region
Because rs10895256 SNP is located at 28 kb far from the
transcriptional start site of YAP1 and electrophoretic mobility
shift assay showed that the binding pattern of nuclear proteins
prepared from H446 cells was very similar for both rs10895256
G and rs10895256 T alleles (Fig. 2A, Lanes 2 and 4), this SNP
might not affect transcriptional factor binding and thus is not
functional relevant. We therefore examined a 2,806-bp potential promoter region of YAP1 based on the genotyped SNPs
derived from the International HapMap Project database
(CHB population data) to find potentially functional variants.
As a result, 1 additional SNP, rs1820453 T>G, was found in this
region located at 875 bp from the transcriptional start site of
YAP1. We thus genotyped this SNP in all of our study subjects
and found that it was in complete linkage disequilibrium with
rs10895256 SNP (r2 ¼ 1.00) and showed exactly the same
association with overall survival time and HRs for death of
patients as did the rs10895256 genotypes (Supplementary
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Functional characterization of rs1820453 SNP
Regulatory sequences with discrete alleles might influence
gene expression upon binding transcriptional activators or
inhibitors that instruct their regulatory control. Therefore,
we first examined whether the rs1820453 T>G SNP changes
the binding pattern of nuclear proteins. EMSA showed that the
binding pattern for rs1820453 G and rs1820453 T differed
greatly; 1 additional DNA-protein complex (IV) was formed
when the rs1820453 G probe was incubated with nuclear
proteins from H446 cells (Fig. 2A, Lane 2) compared to the
rs1820453 T probe under the same experimental conditions
(Fig. 2A, Lane 7). Competition assays showed that the 100-fold
excess of unlabeled rs1820453 G (Fig. 2B, Lane 4) but not
rs1820453 T probe (Fig. 2B, Lane 5) adding to the reaction
mixture significantly eliminated the DNA-protein complex
formed by the interaction between the rs1820453 G and nuclear
proteins, indicating that the binding are sequence specific.
We then examined whether the rs1820453 T>G change
affected YAP1 promoter activity. To do this, a set of luciferase

The arrow indicates an additional DNA-protein complex (IV) for the rs1820453G allele. C, reporter gene assays with constructs containing the
rs1820453G (p-G) or rs1820453T (p-T) YAP1 promoter in H446 cells. All constructs were cotransfected with pRL-SV40 to standardize transfection
efficiency. Luciferase levels of pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV40 were determined in triplicate. Fold increase was measured by defining the activity of the
empty pGL3-Basic vector as 1. Data shown are the means  SE from 3 independent transfection experiments, each performed in triplicate.
The rs1820453G-containing YAP1 promoter drove significantly lower reporter gene expression than the rs1820453T-containing YAP1 promoter
(P < 0.001). D, levels of YAP1 RNA expression in lung tissues as a function of YAP1 rs1820453 T>G genotype. Columns, mean; bars, SE normalized
to GAPDH. Expression level among the GG (n ¼ 3) or TG (n ¼ 27) genotype was significantly (P ¼ 0.005) lower than that among the TT
genotype (n ¼ 26).

reporter gene constructs were made and were transiently
transfected into H446 cells. As expected, the p-T construct
containing the rs1820453T allele drove a significantly higher
reporter gene expression compared with that containing the
rs1820453G allele (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C). This in vitro result
prompted us to examine the association between rs1820453
genotypes and YAP1 RNA expression levels in vivo in lung
tissues. We found that subjects with the rs1820453 TT genotype had significantly higher YAP1 RNA levels (mean  SE)
than those with the rs1820453TG genotype (0.115  0.032 [n ¼
26] vs. 0.050  0.012 [n ¼ 27]; P ¼ 0.012) or the rs1820453GG
genotype (0.020  0.005 [n ¼ 3]; P ¼ 0.035), respectively
(Fig. 2D). When the TG and GG genotypes were pooled
together in analysis, the difference between the TT genotype
and TG/GG genotype was also significant (0.115  0.032 [n ¼
26] vs. 0.047  0.011 [n ¼ 30]; P ¼ 0.005), confirming that the
rs1820453 T-containing promoter has higher transcriptional
activity.

Discussion
In this genome-wide study, we identified 2 genetic variants
that are significantly associated with overall survival of smallcell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in 2 independent cohorts. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report assessing the relationship
between germline genetic variants and prognosis of small-cell
lung cancer at a genome-wide level. We found that rs1820453
T>G SNP in the promoter region of YAP1 located on chromosome 11q22 and rs716274 A>G SNP in the region of downstream of DYNC2H1 located on chromosome 11q22.3 are
genetic factors affecting prognosis of small-cell lung cancer.
In addition, although the functional significance of rs716274
A>G SNP remains to be elucidated, we showed that the
rs1820453 T>G change in the YAP1 promoter region results
in decrease in the YAP1 expression due to the creation of
transcriptional factor binding site, suggesting this SNP to be

causative of variation in survival of patients with small-cell
lung cancer.
The rs1820453 T>G SNP is located in the promoter region of
YAP1 gene on chromosome 11q22, a region shown to be amplified
in 5% to 10% of human cancers including lung, oral, esophageal,
pancreatic, liver, and ovarian carcinomas; however, it has also
been shown in a site of frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast
cancer (13–18). YAP1 encodes Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a
transcriptional coactivator that is important in P73-dependent
apoptosis (19–22). It has been shown that cellular response to
cytotoxic chemotherapy is critically dependent on the function of
P73 and reduction of P73 levels in tumor cells by siRNA, or the
expression of dominant-negative mutants, leads to a strong
reduction of apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents such
as cisplatin (20, 22). Upon DNA damage signaling, P73 accumulates to allow transcription of downstream apoptotic genes, in
which YAP1 plays a crucial role in stabilizing and enhancing P73
activity. In the present study, we found that the rs1820453 T>G
change forms a transcriptional factor (likely a transcriptional
repressor) binding site in the promoter region of YAP1, resulting
in considerably decreased expression of YAP1 in target lung
tissues. This functional significance may be the underlying
mechanism connecting the rs1820453 G allele (GG and GT
genotypes) to poor survival of small-cell lung cancer patients,
because downregulation of YAP1 would be expected to weaken
the function of P73-dependent apoptosis pathway and suppresses chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death, which in turn
results in faster cancer progression and shorter patients’ survival.
The rs716274 A>G SNP is located in "gene desert", a site of
67 kb downstream of DYNC2H1. Although DYNC2H1 mutations cause asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and short ribpolydactyly syndrome type III (23), its role in cancer, especially
in small-cell lung cancer, is currently unknown and further
studies are required.
The present study has several strengths. Unlike other
cancers such as non-small-cell lung cancer where surgical
resection, chemotherapy with multiple anticancer drugs,
and radiotherapy are often jointly used, small-cell lung
cancer patients were mainly and simply treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Studying such a homogeneously
treated group of patients may have enhanced our ability to
find associations if the main genetic factors that influence
small-cell lung cancer survival do so primarily in the context
of this particular regimen. Another major strength of our
study is the 2-phase design in which small-cell lung cancer
patients were recruited from different hospitals for SNP
discovery and validation, which would largely reduce false
positive findings from the genome-wide scan. Indeed, we

examined 26 SNPs identified from the discovery cohort and
only 2 were validated in the replication cohort. Third, we
have characterized the function of rs1820453 SNP, making
the association of this SNP with prognosis of small-cell lung
cancer biologically plausible.
However, despite of aforementioned strengths, we also
acknowledge several limitations of this study. First, the modest sample size of both discovery and replication cohorts
might not have the optimal statistical power, so false negative
and/or chance findings can not fully be excluded. It was noted
that in the discovery phase only 1 SNP, rs716274, was statistically significantly associated with patients’ survival after
Bonferroni correction (P ¼ 1.32  107). Given this finding,
we replicated 26 top SNPs and fortunately found that besides
rs716274 SNP, rs1820453 SNP (in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs10895256) was also significant. Second, in vitro
functional analysis and expression data can only indirectly
support the association. While functional analysis showed
rs1820453 T>G change creating a transcriptional inhibitor
binding site, the identity of nuclear protein bound to this site
remains to be clarified. Third, although we identified 2 SNPs in
YAP1 associated with patients’ survival, we did not resequence whole YAP1 gene, which might miss other functional
and causative YAP1 variants.
In conclusion, by using genome-wide interrogation and
replication strategy, we identified 2 SNPs, rs1820453 T>G
and rs716274 A>G, as genetic factors affecting overall survival
of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy. Although the function of rs716274 A>G SNP is
unclear, rs1820453 T>G SNP within the promoter region of
YAP1 causes downregulation of the gene, which might weaken
P73-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells and suppress chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death, resulting in faster cancer progression and shorter patients’ survival. Larger studies
are warranted to confirm the effects of the 2 SNPs in other
ethnical patient cohorts, and more thorough functional analysis will verify the role of these SNPs in small-cell lung cancer
development or progression.
