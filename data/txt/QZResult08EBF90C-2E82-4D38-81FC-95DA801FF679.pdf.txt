ABSTRACT
The Jak/STAT pathway is activated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) and cooperates with mutant Kras to drive initiation and progression of
PDAC in murine models. We hypothesized that the small-molecule Jak2 inhibitor
(BMS-911543) would elicit anti-tumor activity against PDAC and decrease immune
suppressive features of the disease. We used an aggressive genetically engineered
PDAC model with mutant KrasG12D, tp53R270H, and Brca1 alleles (KPC-Brca1 mice).
Mice with confirmed tumor burden were treated orally with vehicle or 30 mg/kg
BMS-911543 daily for 14 days. Histologic analysis of pancreata from treated mice
revealed fewer foci of adenocarcinoma and significantly decreased Ki67+ cells versus
controls. In vivo administration of BMS-911543 significantly reduced pSTAT5 and
FoxP3 positive cells within the pancreas, but did not alter STAT3 phosphorylation.
Continuous dosing of KPC-Brca1 mice with BMS-911543 resulted in a median survival
of 108 days, as compared to a median survival of 87 days in vehicle treated animals,
a 23% increase (p = 0.055). In vitro experiments demonstrated that PDAC cell lines
were poorly sensitive to BMS-911543, requiring high micromolar concentrations to
achieve targeted inhibition of Jak/STAT signaling. Similarly, BMS-911543 had little
in vitro effect on the viability of both murine and human PDAC-derived stellate cell
lines. However, BMS-911543 potently inhibited phosphorylation of pSTAT3 and
pSTAT5 at low micromolar doses in human PBMC and reduced in vitro differentiation
of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells. These results indicate that single agent Jak2i deserves
further study in preclinical models of PDAC and has distinct inhibitory effects on
STAT5 mediated signaling.

INTRODUCTION

[16–18]. Thus, examining these extrinsic effects on host
immune modulation during Jak/STAT inhibition may
be important in uncovering a mechanism of action and
finding suitable targets for combination therapies.
This current pre-clinical study tested a single agent
Jak2 inhibitor (BMS-911543; Bristol-Myers Squibb) in an
aggressive genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)
of PDAC. We hypothesized that the functionally selective,
small-molecule Jak2 inhibitor would elicit anti-tumor
activity against PDAC and decrease immune suppressive
features of the disease. Single agent BMS-911543 showed
evidence of improved histologic features of disease in this
highly aggressive PDAC GEMM. Interestingly treatment
with BMS-911543 was also associated with reduced
STAT5 phosphorylation and FoxP3+ cells in the tumor
microenvironment. In vitro experiments indicated greater
sensitivity of immune cells to BMS-911543 as compared
to pancreatic tumor or stellate cells. This drug was also
an effective means to limit cytokine-driven expansion of
T regulatory cells in vitro. These results are the first to
characterize the effects of the BMS-911543 Jak2 inhibitor
in an aggressive PDAC model and assess its ability to
elicit distinct inhibitory effects on STAT5 signaling, a
pathway relevant to immunosuppressive T regulatory
cells.

Recent published models predict that pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will surpass breast and
colon cancer, becoming the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths by the year 2030 [1]. Currently,
PDAC is the 4th leading cause of cancer related death in
the world, and in the United States has a dismal 5-year
survival rate of less than 7 percent [2]. One major
difficulty with PDAC is its clinical silence. Typically the
disease only becomes apparent after the tumor invades
surrounding tissues or metastasizes to distant organs [3].
For many years, the current standard of care for most
advanced PDAC patients has been gemcitabine. However
slight improvements in overall survival are emerging
with combination treatment using gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane) [4], or aggressive chemotherapy
regimens (e.g. FOLFIRNOX) as a strategy to de-bulk the
tumor and improve candidacy for surgery [5]. Regardless,
these advances may rightfully be classified as only
incremental, and justify further research to identify novel
strategies with potential for long term clinical responses
and cures for this devastating malignancy.
The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine
kinases that mediate signal transduction through the
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) proteins, which regulate gene
expression important for survival, proliferation, and
differentiation. Recently, activation of the Interleukin-6
(IL-6)/Jak/STAT pathway has been shown to be associated
with poor outcome and response to chemotherapy in
PDAC patients [6, 7]. Furthermore, cytokine mediated
signaling through the Jak/STAT pathway is a means
by which immunosuppressive cell populations such as
T regulatory cells expand in patients with advanced
malignancy [8]. Indeed, these and other immune subsets
including Th17 cells or myeloid derived suppressor
cells (MDSC) are correlated with poor outcome in
PDAC when present at high levels in either the tumor
microenvironment or in circulation [9, 10].
Targeting the Jak/STAT signaling pathway in cancer
is the focus of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies
due to its constitutive activation in many different tumors.
Pre-clinical studies have shown efficacy of pan-Jak1/2
inhibition in many tumors such as myeloproliferative
neoplasms [11], lymphoma [12], NSCLC [13], ovarian
[14], and gastric cancer [15]. However, targeted therapies
may act not only via the tumor but also alter signaling
pathways involved in expansion of immune suppressive
cell populations. Jak/STAT signaling is normally activated
transiently in healthy immune cells however many factors
(IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, VEGF) secreted by pancreatic
tumor or stromal cells could lead to constitutive Jak/
STAT activation and subsequent differentiation of
immunosuppressive populations (Treg, MDSC, Th17)

RESULTS
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM)
of PDAC display activation of Jak/STAT
signaling
Genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic
cancer can recapitulate many features of disease observed
in patients. We evaluated activation of the Jak/STAT
pathway in KPC mice and a highly aggressive variant
of the KPC animals that concurrently incorporates
the Brca1 mutation. A majority of pancreatic cancer
patients exhibit mutated KRAS and approximately 70%
harbor TP53 mutations [19]. BRCA1/2 mutations are
emerging as important genetic alterations in pancreatic
cancer that are found in 5%–10% of patients [20, 21].
Compared to healthy wild type controls, high-grade
PanIN and PDAC lesions were evident in GEMM such
as KPC (mutant KrasG12D, tp53R270H) and KPCBrca1 (mutant KrasG12D, tp53R270H, and Brca1) that
resemble the pathology of pancreatic cancer patients
(Figure 1). Interestingly, in KPC-Brca1 mice, neoplastic
cyst formation was observed with the presence of papillary
mucinous carcinoma similar to clinical observations in
pancreatic cancer patients. Not only do these GEMM
recapitulate human pancreatic cancer histologically,
but they also have an active Jak/STAT signaling
pathway, consistent with human tumors. We observed

phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr 705) and STAT5 (Tyr694)
in pancreatic tissue of KPC and KPC-Brca1 that localized
to both the tumor and stromal cells. In contrast, few if
any pSTAT3 or pSTAT5 positive cells were observed in
pancreata from wild type control mice.

BMS-911543 resulted in a modest (23%) increase in
median survival of 108 days, as compared to a median
survival of 87 days in vehicle treated animals, a 23%
increase (log-rank p = 0.055; Figure 2G).

BMS-911543 administration selectively
decreases pSTAT5 in pancreatic tumors

In vivo administration of BMS-911543 limits
biomarkers of tumor progression in KPC-Brca1
mice

To assess the impact of single agent BMS-911543
on Jak2 signaling in vivo, we utilized IHC to quantify
phosphorylation of downstream Jak/STAT signaling
intermediates including pSTAT3 (Figure 3A and 3B) and
pSTAT5 (Figure 3C and 3D). BMS-911543 treatment did
not significantly change either the percentage of pSTAT3
positive cells, or intensity of staining (H-score; determined
using inform software tools; Supplementary Figure 2) in
the pancreatic tissue (Figure 3B). In contrast, a significant
decrease was observed in both the percentage of pSTAT5
positive cells (Figure 3D; p = 0.041) and the intensity of
pSTAT5 staining (p = 0.046) in the pancreatic tissue of
mice treated with BMS-911543 as compared to vehicle
control (Figure 3D).

To determine whether BMS-911543 elicits in vivo
activity, the aggressive KPC-Brca1 GEMM was utilized.
At 5–6 weeks of age, KPC-Brca1 mice (n = 5/group) were
imaged by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to confirm tumor
burden, and then treated with vehicle or BMS-911543
Jak2i by oral gavage daily for 14 days (Figure 2A). BMS911543 treated mice had an overall reduction in BLI
signal as compared to the vehicle controls (Figure 2B).
Consistent with BLI data, further histological analysis
of pancreata from treated mice showed fewer foci of
PDAC, with a shift toward PanIN lesions when compared
to vehicle controls (Figure 2C–2D and Supplementary
Figure S1). In addition, BMS-911543-treated mice had
35% fewer Ki67 positive cells as compared to vehicle
treated animals (p = 0.023; Figure 2E–2F). The impact of
BMS-911543 on overall survival was evaluated in KPCBrca1 mice 8 weeks of age with more advanced tumors.

proportion of CD3+ cells in poorly differentiated
pancreatic tumor tissue as compared to welldifferentiated tissue (p < 0.0001; Figure 4A and 4B). No
difference in the total number of tumor infiltrating CD3+
T cells was observed between treatment groups in either
well-differentiated or poorly differentiated tisse (p =
0.736; Figure 4B). However, further phenotypic analysis
revealed a significant decrease in the number of FoxP3+
Tregs within the pancreata of BMS-911543 treated
mice as compared to vehicle controls (p = 0.006; Figure
4C–4D). Bioplex analysis of plasma cytokines and
chemokines from KPC-Brca1 mice following 2 weeks
of treatment with BMS-911543 was also conducted
to assess potential biomarkers of antitumor activity. A
panel of cytokines and chemokines were assessed by
multiplex analysis and no differences were observed in
the plasma of mice treated with BMS-911543 compared
to vehicle control (Supplementary Table S1). Phenotypic
analysis of splenocytes revealed no difference in the
percentage of different circulating immunosuppressive
(granulocytic/monocytic MDSC, Tregs) and other
immune subsets (DCs, B cells, T  cells) between
vehicle and BMS-911543 treated mice (Supplementary
Table S2).

Our in vivo data suggest that Jak2 inhibition may
elicit effects upon signaling within multiple cellular
compartments. To further explore the relative sensitivity of
individual cell compartments to BMS-911543, a series of in
vitro studies was conducted. Murine and human PDAC cell
lines were treated with increasing concentrations of BMS911543 for 48 hours. Treatment of murine or human PDAC
cell lines in vitro with BMS-911543 decreased proliferation
only at concentrations greater than 20 μM. The absolute
IC50 values for BMS-911543 were not achievable in any
murine cell line (Figure 5A–5B), and were 39 μM or
greater in all human PDAC cell lines tested (Figure 5D–
5F). Primary SMA+ pancreatic stellate cells derived from
murine KPC-Brca1 PDAC tissue were also treated in vitro
with BMS-911543 (Figure 5C). Similar to PDAC cell lines,
BMS-911543 had only modest effects on PSC proliferation,
and did so only at high micromolar concentrations with an
absolute IC50 value of 43.9. Immunoblot analysis of lysates
from PDAC cell lines or PSC confirmed a limited inhibition
of pSTAT3 which occurred only at higher concentrations
of BMS-911543 (Figure 6A). In contrast, treatment of

these cells with BMS-911543 potently inhibited STAT5
phosphorylation in vitro. The effect of BMS-911543 on
Jak/STAT signaling was also evaluated in healthy donor
PBMC. Because normal donors do not typically have
basal phosphorylation of STAT proteins, these cells were
cultured with BMS-911543 for 2 hours and then stimulated
with 10 ng/ml IL-6 (to induce pSTAT3 signaling) or 4 nM

IL-2 (to induce pSTAT5 signaling) for 20 min. In contrast
to tumor and stellate cells, near complete inhibition of
cytokine-induced STAT3 (Figure 6B) and STAT5 (Figure
6C) phosphorylation was observed after pre-treatment with
BMS-911543. Of note, this inhibition of STAT signaling
in healthy donor PBMC was evident at lower micromolar
doses.

DISCUSSION

BMS-911543 inhibits differentiation of T
regulatory cells in vitro

In the present study we demonstrate that Jak2
inhibition with BMS-911543 can alter histologic
features of disease and limit STAT5 signaling in an
aggressive model of PDAC. These results represent
the first report of this targeted agent in pre-clinical
models of PDAC. Our results provide preliminary data
indicating that this agent may act at the level of STAT5mediated signaling and expansion of T regulatory cells.
We also observed no tissue toxicity or safety issues (no
overt behavioral change or weight loss) with continuous
treatment of mice with BMS-911543. These results are
significant given the urgency for developing novel

Differentiation of T regulatory cells is mediated
by STAT5 signaling. A series of in vitro studies were
conducted to assess whether BMS-911543 could
inhibit cytokine-mediated T reg expansion. For these
studies, CD4+ T lymphocytes isolated from healthy
normal PBMC were cultured with vehicle control or
BMS-911543 and stimulated with plate-bound CD3,
5 ng/ml IL-2 and 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 6 days. In these
experiments, BMS-911543 significantly inhibited in
vitro expansion of CD4+CD25hiFoxp3+ T regulatory cells
(Figure 7A–7B; p = 0.002).

treatment approaches for an almost universally fatal
disease.
The Jak/STAT pathway represents an attractive
target in PDAC [22]. This pathway is constitutively
active in human PDAC tumors and has been correlated
with poor survival [6]. Clinical use of Jak inhibitors
in pancreatic cancer has recently emerged, mostly
in combination with chemotherapy. In a randomized
double-blind phase 2 study, the Jak1/2 inhibitor,
Ruxolitinib was combined with capecitabine and
showed an improvement in overall survival as secondline therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic
cancer [23]. Several other pre-clinical studies have also
examined the role of Jak inhibition in different murine
pancreatic cancer models [24, 25]. For example, in an
orthotopic xenograft model, Ruxolitinib elicited antitumor and anti-angiogenic effects in vivo [26]. Other in
vitro studies have demonstrated that targeting the Jak/
STAT pathway elicits apoptosis in PDAC cell lines [25,
27, 28]. Our pre-clinical work further builds upon these
observations to characterize the activity of the BMS911543 Jak2 inhibitor in a novel and highly aggressive

murine model of spontaneously arising pancreatic
cancer.
Distinct from these prior reports using Jak2
inhibitors in PDAC, our data suggest that STAT5
signaling may be a target of BMS-911543. Both in
vitro and in vivo data support this mechanism, and
preliminarily suggest this may act in part, at the level
of T regulatory cells. Indeed, this transcription factor is
instrumental in regulating the IL-2 mediated survival and
expansion of T regulatory cells which is consistent with
observations in this animal model [29]. This potential
immunomodulatory effect deserves further investigation
in additional mechanistic studies. In contrast, a more
comprehensive analysis of cytokines, chemokines
and cellular biomarkers indicated few if any systemic
changes were evident upon analysis of splenocytes
from these animals. These data indicate the importance
of examining the effect of targeted agents on the tumor
microenvironment.
Despite the anti-tumor effect observed in an
aggressive murine PDAC model, there are a number of
considerations that deserve mention when interpreting

data from this study. First, single agent Jak2 inhibition
provided evidence of benefit but was not curative.
This observation emphasizes the need to understand
mechanisms of resistance to single agent Jak inhibitors
and to pursue combined therapy approaches in future
pre-clinical animal studies. Second, although a
consistent effect was observed on pSTAT5, little effect
of BMS-911543 was evident on pSTAT3. This was
consistent for both in vitro and in vivo studies. This was
not entirely surprising due to prior reports of resistance
to Jak2 inhibition mediated by constitutive STAT3
phosphorylation [30].

In conclusion, our studies characterize the activity of
Jak2 inhibition using BMS-911543 in an aggressive preclinical model of PDAC. In vitro experiments provided
additional evidence suggesting that immune cells may
be more sensitive at the level of signal transduction, as
compared to pancreatic tumor or stellate cells. Further
mechanistic studies will be informative for understanding
the relative contribution of limiting STAT5 signaling in
the tumor and immune compartments as mediators of drug
activity. These data are encouraging in the context of preclinical studies that build off of Jak2 inhibitors as a part of
combined therapy regimens for PDAC.

and correctly targeted clones were injected into C57BL/6J
blastocysts to generate germ-line transmitting chimeras.
For use in in vivo imaging, Rosa26LNL-mCL/+ mice were first
backcrossed for three generations to C57BL/6-cBrd/cBrd/
Cr mice (C57BL/6 albino; NCI, Frederick) to eliminate
the light attenuation caused by dark (black and agouti)
skin and fur and then mated to Brca1-KPC mice. These
animals were interbred with a mouse strain carrying the
Rosa26LSL-mCL allele. The Rosa26LSL-mCL allele is a
conditional knock-in of the mcherry-luciferase transgene
into the Rosa26 locus; the design of the conditional
targeting construct consists of the mcherry-luciferase
transgene being immediately preceded by a LoxP flanked
stop codon, which allows tissue-specific and temporal
control over the expression of the mcherry-luciferase
fusion protein. This conditional knock-in strategy ensures
that only cells that express cre-recombinase and have
undergone cre-mediated recombination, such as Pdx1-cre
expressing pancreatic tumor cells among the KPC animals,
will express mcherry-luciferase protein which can be
visualized either by fluorescence and/or BLI.

Cell lines and reagents
Human PANC-1, MiaPaca-2, BxPC-3 pancreatic
cancer cell lines were cultured in RPMI or DMEM (Gibco)
with 10% FBS, 10 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics.
Murine pancreatic cancer cell lines (CL10–233 and
CL10–247) were derived from KPC-Brca1 mice. BMS911543 (Jak2i inhibitor) was obtained from Bristol Meyers
Squibb (BMS; New Jersey). As previously reported, BMS911543 (N,N-dicyclopropyl-4-((1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol3-yl)amino)-6-ethyl-1-methyl-1,6-dihydroimidazo[4,5-d]
pyrrolo[2,3b]pyridine-7-carboxamide) was prepared in
dimethylsulfoxide for in vitro experiments or in 20%
citrate/80% PEG400 vehicle for in vivo experiments
[31]. Recombinant human IL-6, was purchased from
Peprotech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ) and recombinant human
IL-2 and TGF-β1 were purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN). MTT reagent was purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). Annexin V and propidium iodide
were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA).

In vivo treatment using BMS-911543
Pancreatic tumors were confirmed in KPC-Brca1
mice by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) at 5–6 weeks
of age. Briefly, mice were be maintained on isofluorane
anesthesia and imaged 10–15 minutes following
intraperitoneal injection of Luciferin on a heated
platform of a Xenogen Bioluminescence station in the
Small Animal Imaging Core Laboratory, within our
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Animals with a pancreatic
mass of approximately 50–100 mm3 were randomized, and
treatment was initiated the day following imaging. Mice
were then treated for 2 weeks by daily oral gavage at a
dose of 30 mg/kg BMS-911543. Following 2 weeks of
treatment, animals were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation
followed by cardiac puncture. Plasma, splenocytes and
tumor tissue were collected for further analysis. Pathology
was assessed by H&E to determine differentiation state
of the tissue as PanIN, papillary carcincoma or PDAC.
PanIN was defined as epithelial lesions with basement
membrane and were composed of epithelium with nuclear
and cellular atypia that had papillary, micropapillary and/
or pseudostratified architecture. Papillary carcinoma was
defined as epithelial lesions which were incompletely
confined by the basement membrane and formed papillary
structures that projected into the lumen. PDAC was
defined as epithelial lesions that formed large lobules of
cells that were locally invasive and typically lacked tubular
architecture with high degree of nuclear and cellular
atypia present [35]. For long term in vivo experiments, 8
week old KPC-Brca1 mice with advanced disease were
continuously treated by oral gavage at 30 mg/kg of BMS911543 until mice met specified early removal criteria in
IACUC approved protocols.

Genetically engineered mouse models of
pancreatic cancer
The Brca1-KPC (Brca1flox2/flox2; KrasLSL-G12D/+; p53LSL; Pdx1-cre) mice have been previously described
[32]. In brief, Brca1-KPC mice were generated by
interbreeding Brca1flox2/flox2; KrasLSL-G12D/+ with Brca1flox2/
flox2
; p53LSL-R270H/+; Pdx1-cre animals. The Brca1flox2 mice
have been previously described [33]. The mouse strains
p53LSL-R270H (strain number 01XM3), KrasLSL-G12D (strain
number 01XJ6), and Pdx1-cre (strain number 01XL5)
were acquired from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Frederick Mouse Repository. Due to the number of alleles,
it was necessary to maintain mice on a mixed 129/B6
genetic background. To allow quantitative bioluminescent
imaging, KPC-Brca1 mice were crossed to have white
fur, and express the luciferase transgene. A mCherryluciferase 2 (mCL) fusion gene cassette was amplified
by PCR to introduce SalI and NotI sites at the 5′ and 3′
ends, respectively. A SpeI-SalI fragment containing a loxPflanked promoterless neomycin expression cassette (loxPneomycin-3 copies of the simian virus 40 polyadenylation
signal (SV40polyA)-loxP) and the SalI-NotI mCL fragment
were inserted together into a SpeI-NotI digested pBigT
vector [34]. The insert of the resulting plasmid, consisting
of the adenoviral splice acceptor sequence followed by the
loxP-flanked neomycin expression cassette (LNL), mCL
and a SV40polyA cassette, was excised by PacI-AscI and
inserted into the ROSA26-PA vector [34]. The final knockin vector Rosa26LNL-mCL was linearized with SnaBI and
electroporated into 129/SV embryonic stem cells. G418resistant ES clones were analyzed by Southern blotting

Pancreatic stellate cell isolation and culture

incubated on ice for 30 minutes, washed, and fixed in PBS
containing 1% formalin for flow cytometric analysis on a
LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

Fresh tissue from KPC-Brca1 pancreatic tumors
was dissected with a scalpel into 0.5–1 mm3 pieces,
further dissociated using collagenase type II (Worthington
Biochemical, Lakewood NJ), filtered using a 70 μM filter
and then plated in 6-well 10 cm2 uncoated culture wells in
DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics and incubated at
37°C. PSC typically grew out of the tissue in 2–3 weeks
and were characterized by morphology and histological
analysis of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA+) staining.
PSC were maintained in culture with fresh media added
twice weekly.

MTT assay
Human and murine PDAC tumor cells or PSC were
cultured in 96 well plates and the following day treated
with BMS-911543 or DMSO vehicle control for 48 hours.
After 48 hours, MTT reagent (ATCC) was added for 2
hours at 37°C. Samples were analyzed on a plate reader
testing for absorbance at 450 nM.

Immunoblot analysis

Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis

Cell lysates were assayed for protein expression
by immunoblot analysis with antibodies (Ab) against
STAT3 (Catalog 4904), pSTAT3 (Catalog 9145; Tyr705),
STAT5 (Catalog 9363), pSTAT5 (Catalog 9351; Tyr694),
and β-actin (Catalog 4967; Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA). Following incubation with appropriate
horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, immune
complexes were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Formalin fixed pancreatic tissue from in vivo
experiments was subjected to IHC analysis following
staining with antibodies against pSTAT3 (Catalog 4904;
Cell Signaling), pSTAT5 (Catalog ab30648; Abcam,
Cambridge MA), and FoxP3 (Catalog 88–8111-40;
ebioscience, San Diego, CA). For pSTAT3 and pSTAT5
analysis, 20x magnification images of pancreata (5 images
per mouse) were quantified using PerkinElmer’s Vectra
multispectral slide analysis system. inForm software
tools were used to segment sections on a cellular basis
into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane fractions. DAB
staining was measured in each cellular compartment and
quantified by the percentage of cells and H-score. H-score
accounts for both spectral intensity and percentage of
positive cells. For FoxP3 analysis, blinded histological
analysis of staining in the pancreas was counted at 40x
magnification, with at least 15 fields counted per mouse.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
isolation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated from source leukocytes of healthy donors
(American Red Cross, Columbus, OH) via density
gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham,
Pharmacia Biotech, Bjorkgatan, Sweeden) as described
[10]. PBMCs from healthy donors from the American
Red Cross (Columbus, OH) were cultured in 10% FBS, 10
mM L-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin
in RPMI 1640 (Gibco).

Flow cytometry
Immunophenotypic analyses of splenoctyes from
animals were assessed by flow cytometry. Antibodies to
stain for MDSC were CD11b-APC (Clone M1/70; BD
Biosciences), Ly6G-FITC (Clone 1A8; BD Biosciences),
Ly6C-PE (Clone AL-21; BD Biosciences); for dendritic
cells were CD11c (Clone HL3; BD Biosciences); for B
cells B220-APC (Clone RA3–6B2; BD Biosciences),
CD3-FITC (Clone 145–1011; BD Biosciences). T
regulatory cells with a phenotype of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+
were evaluated using a commercially available kit
(eBiosciences, San Diego, CA). For T cell activation
markers, cells were stained with antibodies specific for
CD4-PE-Cy7 (Clone RM4–5; BD Biosciences), CD8-PECy7 (Clone 53–6.7; BD Biosciences), CD62L-PE (Clone
MEL-14; BD Biosciences), and CD44-Bv650 (Clone IM7;
Biolegend). To determine Th1 and Th2 phenotypes, cells
were stained using fluorochrome conjugated antibodies
targeted CXCR3-PE-Cy7 (Clone CXCR13–173;
Biolegend), CCR4-PE (Clone 2G12; Biolegend), and
CCR6-APC (Clone CK4-L3; BD Biosciences). Cells were

In vitro differentiation of T regulatory cells
T regulatory cells were differentiated in vitro as
previously described [36]. Briefly, CD4+ T cells were
negatively selected from source leukocytes (American
Red Cross, Columbus, OH) using a rosette separation
kit (STEMCELL Technologies; Vancouver, BC) and
stimulated with 1 μg/ml plate-bound CD3 antibody, 5
ng/ml IL-2 and 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 6 days. Cells were
harvested and stained by flow cytometry for canonical
Treg markers CD4-APC (Catalog IMQ468U; Beckman
Coulter), CD25-FITC (Clone M-A251; BD Biosciences),
and Foxp3 (Clone 259D/C7; BD Biosciences).

Statistics
Two-sample t-tests were used to compare IHC
outcomes between the control and BMS-911543 treated

mice. If necessary to meet the assumptions of constant
variance and normality, outcomes were log-transformed.
Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test were used
to compare overall survival between the two treatment
groups. The 4-parameter logistic Hill model [37] was the
assumed dose-response relationship for the cell viability
experiments. Nonlinear least squares regression was
used to estimate the model parameters and generate 95%
confidence intervals for the IC50 estimates. A mixedeffects model was used to analyze the number of CD3+
cells between the well and poorly differentiated tissue
samples. A random effect for mouse was included to
account for the two samples per mouse and fixed effects
for treatment, differentiation category and the interaction
of the two. For the bioplex analysis of cytokines and
chemokines, geometric means were calculated by
treatment group as well as 95% confidence intervals for
the fold differences. Paired t-tests were used to test the
change in the proportions of CD4 in the T regulatory
donor cell experiments. All analyses were performed using
SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
