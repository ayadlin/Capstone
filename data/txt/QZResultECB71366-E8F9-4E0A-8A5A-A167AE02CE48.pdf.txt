Abstract
Deregulation of Ras pathways results in complex abnormalities of multiple signaling cascades that contribute to human
malignancies. Ras is therefore considered an appropriate
target for cancer therapy. In light of the complexity of the
deregulated Ras pathway, it is important to decipher at the
molecular level the response of cancer cells to Ras inhibitors
that would reregulate it. In the present study, we used gene
expression profiling as a robust method for the global
dissection of gene expression alterations that resulted from
treatment with the Ras inhibitor S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid
(FTS; salirasib). Use of a ranking-based procedure, combined
with functional analysis and promoter sequence analysis,
enabled us to decipher the common and most prominent
patterns of the transcriptional response of five different
human cancer cell lines to FTS. Remarkably, the analysis
identified a distinctive core transcriptional response to FTS
that was common to all cancer cell lines tested. This signature
fits well to a recently described deregulated Ras pathway
signature that predicted sensitivity to FTS. Taken together,
these studies provide strong support for the conclusion that
FTS specifically reregulates defective Ras pathways in human
tumor cells. Ras pathway reregulation by FTS was manifested
by repression of E2F-regulated and NF-Y–regulated genes and
of the transcription factor FOS (all of which control cell
proliferation), repression of survivin expression (which blocks
apoptosis), and induction of activating transcription factor–
regulated and Bach2-regulated genes (which participate in
translation and stress responses). Our results suggest that
cancer patients with deregulated Ras pathway tumors might
benefit from FTS treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3320–8]

Introduction
Ras and its effectors regulate cell growth, differentiation,
motility, survival, and death (1). Deregulation of Ras pathways by
mutational activation or by receptor-mediated activation of Ras
contribute to human malignancies (1). Approximately one third of

all human cancers, including cancers of the pancreas, colon, and
lung, express a constitutively active oncogenic Ras (1). Therefore,
inhibition of Ras or its upstream activators or downstream
effectors seems to be a promising pharmacologic strategy for
cancer therapy (2, 3). Several such inhibitors are indeed already in
clinical use, and a significant number of new inhibitors are at
various stages of clinical trials (3). One such compound is the Ras
inhibitor S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; salirasib), which interferes with Ras membrane anchorage (3, 4). FTS was shown to
efficiently inhibit the active GTP-bound Ras in various human
cancer cell lines (3, 4). Treatment of cancer cells with FTS results in
diminished Ras signaling and attenuation of cell growth in vitro
and in vivo (4–8). Those early experiments suggested that
deregulated Ras pathways could apparently be ‘‘corrected,’’ at least
in part, by FTS. This notion was supported by the close positive
correlation recently observed between the probability of Ras
pathway deregulation determined by gene expression profiling and
the extent of inhibition of cell proliferation by FTS (9).
These and related studies (10, 11) emphasized the usefulness of
genetic profiling in defining Ras and other oncogene pathway
deregulation signatures in cancer cells. Such profiling is particularly important for the design of drug treatments because cancer
cells exhibit a plethora of genetic aberrations, many of which, like
the chronically active Ras, participate in the deregulated growth
and in cell death (12). Here, we used the robust method of highthroughput microarray expression profiling combined with advanced bioinformatic tools (13) to analyze the response of a variety
of human cancer cells to FTS. We established a comprehensive
database of five different FTS-treated human tumor cell lines that
exhibit diverse abnormalities in Ras and in Ras-related signaling
pathways. The cell lines examined in this study were U87
glioblastoma cells characterized by large amounts of activated
wild-type Ras reflecting overexpression of tyrosine kinase receptors, A549 non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells with
constitutively active oncogenic K-Ras(12V), LAN1 neuroblastoma
cells with amplified Myc-N gene, SHEP neuroblastoma cells devoid
of amplified Myc-N gene, and NCIH929 myeloid cells that harbor
oncogenic N-Ras(13V) and amplified c-Myc gene. We then applied
an integrative analysis of gene expression profiles to search for
FTS-induced core transcriptional responses that are shared by all
of the tested cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human tumor cell lines used and their growth
conditions have been described previously (5, 6). FTS was a gift from
Concordia Pharmaceuticals (Sunrise, FL). Cell proliferation assays and
determination of IC50 values (FTS concentration that induces 50% growth
inhibition) were done as described (5, 6). The effect of FTS on gene

expression in various cell lines was determined 24 and 48 h or 72 h after
treatment with FTS or vehicle (Fig. 1A) as described (5, 6). Zero-time
incubation was included. Total RNA from each sample was used to prepare
fragmented cRNA for hybridization (5, 6).
Analysis of gene expression data. For gene expression profiling of each
tumor cell line, done by comparing samples from FTS-treated cells and

vehicle-treated control cells at the time points and drug doses listed in
Fig. 1A, we used Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) Human Genome Focus
oligonucleotide arrays representing more than 8K well-annotated genes that
collectively cover all aspects of cellular physiology. Data on U87 and LAN1
cells were taken from our earlier studies (5, 6), and data on SHEP, A549, and
NCIH929 were generated here.
First, we filtered the probe sets of all five cell lines, representing 11
different conditions (Fig. 1A), to generate expression profiles that were
detectable by the Affymetrix MAS 5 analysis package as ‘‘present’’ in at least
one sample and whose expression was flagged as ‘‘increased’’ or ‘‘decreased’’
under at least one FTS-treated condition. This filtration procedure
generated a list of 5,111 probe sets (see Supplementary Table S1). We then
subjected the gene expression data under the 11 conditions to hierarchical
clustering using the EXPANDER software (14). Before clustering, the
expression levels of each gene were standardized so that mean is equal to 0
and variance is equal to 1.
To define a set of genes that responded to FTS treatment, we applied a
rank-sorting method for selecting the most reactive genes that were
changed in the same direction in most of the conditions. For each
condition, all 5,111 probes sets were sorted according to the magnitude of
their log ratio values. We then calculated the average rank of each gene and
selected the 500 genes with the highest average rank and the 500 genes with
the lowest average rank (a total of 1,000 active genes; see Supplementary
Table S2). To identify the major expression patterns, we subjected these
responsive genes to cluster analysis using the CLICK algorithm (15)
implemented in the EXPANDER package.5 After standardization, positive
and negative values no longer represented up-regulation and downregulation; therefore, for visualization purposes, we added to the data a
dummy condition (column) representing ‘‘no change.’’ The dummy
condition allows the visual distinction between absolute up-regulation
and down-regulation. Standardized log ratio values above and below the
standardized dummy level then represented up-regulation and downregulation, respectively.
Analysis of functional categories. Software for association of human
genes with the Gene Ontology category of biological processes was
downloaded from the Gene Ontology Web site.6 Enrichments of specific
clusters for genes of a particular functional category were identified using
the TANGO algorithm implemented in EXPANDER, in which hypergeometric calculation is used to determine overrepresented Gene Ontology
functional categories in a target set relative to a background set. The group
of genes of interest was used as the target set, whereas the background set
comprised the 5,111 probe sets. Certain genes were represented in the
microarray by several probe sets. To avoid biases, genes represented by
multiple probe sets were counted only once.
Computational promoter analysis. We applied the PRIMA algorithm
(13) implemented in EXPANDER to identify cis-regulatory promoter
elements that control the observed transcriptional modulation in our
microarray data set. Given target and background sets of promoters,
PRIMA does statistical tests to identify transcription factors whose
binding site signatures are significantly overrepresented in the target set
relative to background (transcription factor enrichment is indicated by
P value).
Real-time PCR analysis. Extracts of total RNA (1 Ag) from U87 cells
treated for 48 h or A549 cells treated for 72 h with FTS (75 Amol/L) or
vehicle (control) were reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) as described (16). The cDNA samples were
used for real-time PCR (SYBR Green PCR kit, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) as described (16) using the primers 5-AAGAACGAGAAGCAGCATTTG-3 and 5-TTCTGAGCCCGGACAATACA-3 [activating transcription
factor (ATF) 3] or 5-ATGATTACCTGGAGGTGG-3 and 5-ATCCTCCTTGCTGTTGTTGG-3 (ATF4) or primers for the housekeeping gene
HMBS (5).

Results
Profiling of gene expression in FTS-treated human tumor
cell lines. To identify common transcriptional responses to FTS
treatment, we did a global analysis of gene expression in five
different FTS-treated tumor cell lines under conditions at which
cell growth is inhibited. Because, under certain conditions, FTS can
induce apoptotic cell death (5, 6), gene expression analysis was
done in each cell line according to its sensitivity to FTS under
defined conditions at which cell growth was inhibited but the cells
do not die. The IC50 values for FTS-induced inhibition of cell
growth (Fig. 1A) are relatively high because FTS binds to the serum
proteins, and this leads to low free drug concentrations in the
growth medium (4–8). In all cases, we examined two or three pairs
of cell preparations that included the vehicle control and the drugtreated cells at one or two concentrations or a single dose at two or
three time points. Altogether, 22 samples of RNA extracts were
isolated from the five sets of human tumor cell lines and subjected
to Affymetrix gene expression analysis. This generated a database
of FTS-induced alterations in gene expression as reflected from 11
distinct conditions (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1A), enabling us
to do a global dissection of the transcriptional response to FTS.
Global hierarchical clustering analysis of FTS-treated
cancer cells. Next, we subjected the data sets to hierarchical
clustering of the conditions (Fig. 1B). This analysis yielded an
appreciation of the general pattern of gene expression alterations
manifested in the different cell lines. The hierarchical clustering
showed that, in each case, all the conditions related to the same
cell line were grouped together in one branch (Fig. 1B). This
indicated that the microarray measurements were robust and
could preserve the unique transcriptional behavior of each type of
cell line. Moreover, all the conditions related to U87 and A549 cells
were clustered together in a common branch, possibly reflecting a
stronger dependence of these cells on Ras signaling (Fig. 1B).
Hierarchical clustering applied to the 22 conditions (i.e., before
dividing the values of treated samples by their untreated controls)
yielded a primary partition of the dendrogram according to cell
line/tissue and a secondary one reflecting FTS treatment (data not
shown), showing that the effect of tissue of origin on expression
profile is stronger than that which results in response to FTS.
Ranking-based identification of major expression patterns
in FTS-treated cells. To focus on the most prominent FTSinduced alterations in gene expression, we first applied a ranked
sorting method that selected the most reactive genes with changes
in the same direction under most of the conditions (see Materials
and Methods). The ranking-based list (Supplementary Table S2),
representing the 1,000 most responsive genes (500 up-regulated
and 500 down-regulated by FTS treatment), was then used for all
subsequent data analysis. The response of these genes to FTS
treatment in the various cell lines clearly shows the common
patterns of changes in gene expression across all 11 examined
conditions (Fig. 2A).
To further identify prominent expression patterns among the
ranking-based 1,000 active genes, we subjected the data (log ratios)
to cluster analysis using the CLICK algorithm implemented in the
EXPANDER package (14, 15). Before clustering, the log ratios of
each gene were standardized to mean equal to 0 and variance equal
to 1 (15); hence, genes that are clustered together show similar
alteration patterns across the tested conditions but might differ in
the magnitude of their response. CLICK (15) identified two major
clusters, representing decreased and increased steady-state mRNA

levels: cluster 1 contained 418 genes whose expression was
decreased by the FTS treatment and cluster 2 contained 374 genes
whose expression was increased by the FTS treatment through all
the condition sets (Fig. 2B). Inspection of these two clusters
revealed that the most vigorous response to FTS treatment was
shown by the U87 and A549 cell lines (Fig. 2B). Five smaller
clusters, consisting of 20 to 50 genes, exhibited more complex
patterns (data not shown) and were not analyzed further.
Identification of overrepresented functional categories
within gene clusters up-regulated or down-regulated by FTS.
To characterize the biological processes participating in the
response to the treatment with FTS in all cancer cell lines, we
used EXPANDER for statistical analyses aimed at identifying
functional categories that are significantly enriched in the clusters.
For description of biological processes, we used the standard Gene
Ontology vocabulary. Enriched functional categories (P V 0.05, after
correction for multiple testing) were identified in each of the two
main clusters (Table 1; see Supplementary Table S3 for a list of the
genes associated with each of the enriched functional categories).
The cluster of down-regulated genes (cluster 1) showed
extremely high enrichment for genes related to mitosis, cell cycle,
DNA replication, spindle organization and biogenesis, nucleotide
binding, and cell cycle checkpoint categories (Table 1). For
example, FTS seemed to decrease the expression of genes required
for cell growth, such as cell cycle phosphatases (CDC25A and
CDKN3), cell cycle kinases (CDC2 and CDK2), polymerases (POLA2
and POLE2), minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2 and
MCM5), cyclins (CCNA2 and CCNE2), transcription factors (E2F1
and FOS), and oncogenes (RAB4A; see Supplementary Table S3).

www.aacrjournals.org

This finding is in accordance with the FTS-induced inhibition of
DNA synthesis and cell growth observed in the cancer cell lines
screened here (3, 5–7). The decrease in expression of this
remarkably large number of cell cycle regulatory genes, which
was common to all tested cell lines, points to a fundamental core
response to FTS. It is also worth noting that FTS decreased the
transcript level of the antiapoptotic gene survivin in all five tested
cell lines, in agreement with our recent observation in U87 cells
and prostate cancer cells (16).
The up-regulated genes (cluster 2) showed high enrichment for
genes related to the programmed cell death category (Table 1).
Thus, FTS seemed to induce the expression of several proapoptotic
genes, including BAK1, the tumor suppressor TP53, which plays a
role in apoptosis and whose mRNA steady-state level was shown to
be up-regulated by FTS in human colon carcinoma (8), GADD45A,
which participates in the induction of apoptosis (17), and FOXO3A,
which functions as a trigger for apoptosis (Supplementary Table
S3). Interestingly, expression of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) cell cycle
inhibitor (CDKN1A), previously shown to be up-regulated by FTS in
human colon carcinoma (8), was also increased in all FTS-treated
cancer cell lines. The observed enrichment in up-regulated
apoptosis-related genes is in accord with our earlier observations
that FTS can stimulate cell death mechanisms in a variety of cancer
cell lines (5).
An additional category of up-regulated genes in cluster 2 was
that of genes that participate in amino acid metabolism known to
be associated with stress response (Table 1). Included in this group
are several genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes
(Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, Met-tRNA synthetase is

up-regulated in response to hypoxic stresses (18), raising the
possibility that the response of cancer cells to FTS might involve
adaptation to stress.
Only few outliers were detected in search for genes that were upregulated or down-regulated in a counterintuitive manner. These
included CASP8AP2, a proapoptotic gene that was down-regulated,
and several genes that were up-regulated. These genes included
EREG, an epidermal growth factor receptor ligand, BIRC4, which
inhibits apoptosis, IL6, which can contribute to expression of a
malignant phenotype, and IL8, a potent angiogenic factor.
Promoter analysis of FTS-induced down-regulated genes
reveals a prominent signature of cell cycle arrest. The primary
target of FTS is the active Ras protein (3, 4), whose signaling
pathways control a large number of transcription factors regulating
expression of genes involved in cell cycle and cell survival. We
therefore did global promoter analysis to identify common
transcription factors participating in the response of cancer cells
to FTS. We were particularly interested in tracking regulators
whose modulation in response to the drug treatment could be
interpreted in light of the defined functional categories of the
responding genes. To this end, we applied the promoter analysis
algorithm PRIMA (13) implemented in the EXPANDER package.
Each of the two gene clusters described above (Fig. 2B) was
considered a target set, and the entire set of 5,111 genes served as
the background (see Materials and Methods). In cluster 1 (FTSinduced down-regulated genes), PRIMA identified four enriched
transcription factor–binding site signatures: E2F, NF-Y, ZF5, and
nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1; P < 0.002; Fig. 3A). Enrichment
was highest for E2F and NF-Y, both well-established transcriptional
regulators of the cell cycle that are controlled by Ras (19–21).
Evidently, high levels of active Ras and increased activation of E2F
and NF-Y are common to many human tumors (19, 21–23).
A large number of genes (74) contained at least one high-scoring
putative E2F-binding site (Supplementary Table S4), among them
genes known to be under the direct control of E2F, such as CDC6,
DNMT1, MCM2, MCM3, MCM5, POLA, POLE, POLE2, CDC25A, and
DHFR. Because all of these genes are functionally important in S
phase, these results are consistent with those obtained by
functional analysis showing a common signature of cell cycle
arrest (Table 1). Other genes identified here are not known to be
regulated by E2F and thus might represent novel putative E2F
targets.
EXPANDER also identified 136 genes containing at least one
high-scoring putative NF-Y–binding site, among them several that
were previously reported to be positively regulated by NF-Y (e.g.,
CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC25C, and CDC2; refs. 24, 25). These genes are
associated with mitotic cell cycle, M phase, and cell proliferation,
and the expression of some of them is reportedly controlled by Ras
(25, 26). Here, too, EXPANDER identified other genes that could
represent novel putative NF-Y targets. EXPANDER also identified
enrichment in NRF1 and ZF5.
Promoter analysis of FTS-induced up-regulated genes reveals
a prominent signature of a stress response. Promoter analysis of
the FTS-induced up-regulated genes (cluster 2) identified four transcription factors whose binding site signatures were overrepresented
in the target set (Fig. 3A). These were the transcription factors
Bach2, ATF, Elk-1, and FAC1. The highest enrichment was observed
for Bach2. Bach2 is a transcription factor known to be regulated by
an oxidative stress–sensitive conditional nuclear export.
The promoter analysis also pointed to enrichment in ATFregulated and Elk-1–regulated genes, suggesting that FTS up-

regulates their transcriptional activities. Both transcription factors
are associated with stress responses (27, 28). In addition, the
microarray data suggested not only an increase in ATF-regulated
genes but also increases in the steady-state levels of mRNAs
encoding four members of the ATF family (ATF3, ATF4, ATF5, and
ATF6) themselves, which seemed to be elevated by FTS in all FTStreated cancer cell lines. The most prominent elevations were
observed in ATF3 and ATF4 (2- to 15-fold; see also Fig. 3B). Realtime PCR confirmed the marked increase in ATF3 and ATF4 mRNA
levels in U87 and A549 cells (Fig. 3C).
Patterns of Ras pathway reregulation by FTS match
signatures of Ras pathway deregulation and neoplastic
transformation. Recent gene expression profiling identified
distinctive patterns of oncogenic pathway deregulation in human
mammary epithelial cells infected with adenovirus expressing
activated H-Ras, c-Myc, c-Src, activated h-catenin, or E2F3 (9).

Salirasib (FTS) Gene Expression Signature

These patterns were used to develop expression signatures
predictive of oncogene-specific pathway deregulation and drug
sensitivity (9). In this study, we identified the gene expression
signature that seems to reflect FTS-induced reregulation of Ras
pathways. To examine the correspondence between our results and
the oncogene deregulation signatures defined in ref. 9, we
compared the lists of the 1,000 most responsive genes (the core
transcriptional response to FTS; Supplementary Table S2) probed
in our study and the H-Ras–, c-Myc–, c-Src–, h-catenin–, and E2F3derived signatures. The results of the analysis (Supplementary
Table S5) show that only a relatively small proportion of genes in
the c-Src–derived (6%), h-catenin–derived (2%), and c-Myc–derived
(4%) deregulation signatures shared commonality with genes that
were altered in the cancer cell lines by the FTS treatment. A
relatively high proportion of genes (8%) in the E2F3-transformed
cells showed commonality with genes that were altered in the FTStreated cancer cell lines, and the highest proportion of common
genes was found in the activated H-Ras–transformed cells and FTStreated cells (12%). Interestingly, this correspondence was even
improved when the oncogene deregulation signatures were
compared with the gene signature of A549 cells, which, unlike
the other cell lines, express the constitutively active K-Ras(G12V)
(Supplementary Table S5). Next, we compared the Ras signature
with genes that were differentially expressed in NSCLC with and

without Ras mutation (see Fig. 2C in ref. 9). Among the 248 genes
that were up-regulated by FTS treatment and were differentially
expressed in the NSCLC (P < 0.05), 153 and 95 were down-regulated
and up-regulated in the Ras-mutated samples, respectively. Among
the 302 genes that were down-regulated by FTS treatment and were
differentially expressed in the NSCLC (P < 0.05), 226 and 76 were
down-regulated and up-regulated in the Ras-mutated samples,
respectively. Thus, both positive and negative overlaps are
observed, indicting that FTS treatment and expression of
oncogenic K-Ras elicit opposite responses as expected as well as
common responses. The latter could be associated with general
physiologic perturbations.
Next, we sought to examine the correspondence between the
FTS-induced signature and the previously described meta-signature identifying genes that are overexpressed in most cancer types
relative to the normal tissues from which they arose and that seem
to reflect essential transcriptional traits of neoplastic transformation (29). We found that the FTS signature (Supplementary Table
S2) fitted well to the gene meta-signatures of undifferentiated
tumors (see Fig. 3 in ref. 29). Of the 69 genes of the meta-signature,
there were 33 in common with the FTS signature and 27 genes in
this common list (82%) were strongly down-regulated by FTS.
These included the cell cycle genes (CDC2, MCM3, CDNK3, and
TOP2A) and additional genes critical for malignant transformation,
such as PCNA and BIRC5. We also compared the FTS signature and
the distinct expression signature of glioblastoma multiformes
(GBM) generated by profiling normal brain and brain tumor tissues
from 32 patients (30). Of the 97 characterized genes (GBM
signature) that are more highly expressed in GBMs than in normal
brain (see Fig. 2 in ref. 30), we identified 67 in common with the
FTS signature, of which 47 (77%) were down-regulated by FTS.
Overall, the comparative analyses showed that the FTS signature
points to reregulation of the deregulated Ras pathways as well as of
the transcriptional profiles that seem to be essential for neoplastic
transformation (29, 30).

Discussion

Figure 4. Proposed model for the salirasib-induced repression of cell cycle
genes leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth. Ras pathways participating
in regulation of cell cycle progression (19–21). Ras inhibition by FTS reduces
ERK activation and cyclin D1/CDK4 assembly and increases GSK3h-mediated
degradation of cyclin D1, together resulting in down-regulation of the
transcription factor E2F1. Positive regulation of the transcription factors NRF1,
FOS, and NFY by ERK is also diminished.

A ranking-based procedure combined with functional analysis
and promoter sequence analysis (31) enabled us to decipher the
common and most prominent patterns of the gene expression
response of five different human cancer cell lines to the Ras
inhibitor FTS (salirasib). The analysis required the use of a method
that allows comparisons of gene expression profiles in a manner
that is less sensitive to outliers. We therefore used a ranking-based
gene selection procedure in combination with functional analysis
and promoter sequence analysis using the EXPANDER (14).
Although this method maximizes the detection of the effects of
FTS on gene expression, the genetic differences among the cell
lines cannot be completely eliminated. Some differences among
cell lines in response to FTS, which are not discussed here, were
indeed detected. Our major aim in this study was to identify a core
response to FTS, which is universally shared by all probed cell lines
regardless of genetic and tissue differences.
Remarkably, the functional analysis yielded enriched Gene
Ontology categories of cell cycle progression, cell death, and stress
response. Similarly the PRIMA promoter analysis yielded enriched
transcription factor signatures typical of regulators of the cell cycle
and of stress. These complementary results established a signature
of Ras pathway reregulation by FTS. The signature of the FTS
treatment fitted well to a deregulated H-Ras pathway signature that

by itself predicted sensitivity to FTS (9). These experiments
provided strong support for the notion that FTS specifically
reregulates defective Ras pathways in human cancer cells.
Attenuation of cell division. The core transcriptional repression response to FTS is clearly attributable to the known anti-Ras
activity of this inhibitor, which results in inhibition of cancer cell
growth. Our analysis points to the suppression of genes that are
positively regulated by the transcription factors E2F and NF-Y.
These transcription factors are, respectively, essential for cell cycle
progression through S phase and mitosis (25, 26). The FTS-induced
suppression of genes regulated by E2F and NF-Y implies that their
transcriptional activity is reduced as a consequence of Ras
inhibition as presented schematically in Fig. 4. Ample evidence
indeed exists for the critical role of active Ras and its downstream
effectors in regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)cyclin D1/RB/E2F1 pathway (32) and of NF-Y activation (21, 33). In
addition, we and others have shown that, concomitantly with FTS
inhibition of Ras, the levels of cyclin D1 are decreased and the
activity and expression of E2F are down-regulated in various
human tumor cell lines, including U87 glioblastoma cells,
neuroblastoma LAN1 cells, melanoma, and LNCaP and PC3
prostate cells (3, 6). In addition, forced expression of E2F1 can
overcome the growth-inhibitory effects of FTS (34).
The core transcriptional repression response to FTS includes
reduction in NRF1 (Fig. 3A), a transcription factor known to regulate
expression of genes participating in mitochondrial function and
mitochondrial biogenesis (35). This observation suggests that Ras
signals might positively regulate NRF1 target genes and mitochondrial functions (see scheme, Fig. 4). This possibility is supported by
earlier studies showing that extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) participate
in NRF1 nuclear accumulation (36) and that NRF1 might play
an integrative role in nucleo-mitochondrial interactions (35).
Interestingly, in two recent genome-wide analyses of transcription factors, motif-finding algorithms predicted the existence of
NRF1-binding sites in E2F target promoters (13, 37). A genomewide transcription factor analysis confirmed these predictions and
showed that NRF1 functions as a coregulator of numerous E2F
target genes (37). Thus, NRF1 plays a role as a regulator of cell cycle
genes as well as of genes that participate in mitochondrial function.
In line with these findings, our promoter analysis showed that
many genes described as NRF1 targets are also E2F targets,
suggesting common regulation of these genes by both E2F and
NRF1 (13, 37). Importantly, our analysis identified 103 genes in
cluster 1 whose promoters contained binding sites for NRF1 but
not for E2F, suggesting that, in addition to E2F, FTS also induces
down-regulation of NRF1.
Enhancement of stress response genes. The common
transcriptional induction response to FTS of cancer cells seems
to be associated mainly with a stress response as shown by the upregulation of the transcription factors ATF3, ATF4, and Bach2
(Fig. 3A). Stress responses induced by a variety of stimuli, including
amino acid starvation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidants, and
cytotoxic drugs, enhance transcription of ATF4 and ATF3 and
reduce global translation (38, 39). Whereas global translation in the
stressed cells is reduced, translation of ATF4 and ATF3 is
enhanced, leading to the transcriptional transactivation of ATF3/
ATF4 target genes, which in turn function toward adaptation of the
cell to the stress insult by reconfiguration of gene expression (38).
The mechanisms of typical stress responses and the control of
protein synthesis have been well characterized. Both stress kinases

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

GCN2 and PERK, each of which is activated by different stress
signals, directly phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor
eIF2a at Ser51. Phosphorylated eIF2 is a competitive inhibitor of
its own guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and leads to
general inhibition of translation (38, 40). Importantly, regulation of
global protein synthesis was also shown to be mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3h
(GSK3h) signaling (41) as presented schematically in Fig. 5. GSK3h
phosphorylates eIF2B, thus inactivating it and resulting in
subsequent inhibition of translation initiation (41). GSK3h,
however, is itself negatively regulated by AKT, which phosphorylates and inactivates it (41). Therefore, Ras inhibition by FTS and
the consequent inhibition of PI3K/AKT activation that relieves
GSK3h will result in phosphorylation and inhibition of eIF2B (see
scheme, Fig. 5). This would lead to inhibition of overall translation
followed by induction of the stress response pathway. Our analysis
shows that FTS indeed induces an increase in ATF3 and ATF4
expression (Fig. 3B) as well as in some of their known target genes
(Supplementary Table S3). The overall inhibition of translation that
seems to be induced by FTS in cancer cells is thus apparently a

translation and induction of a response to stress. Ras/PI3K/AKT/GSK3h/eIF2B
pathway controlling the initiation of translation pathway (41) and the GSK3h/
p70S6K pathway controlling the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor
Bach2 (45). Ras inhibition by FTS increases ATF4 levels and nuclear
translocation of Bach2.

mirror image of the enhanced overall translation initiation that is
induced by oncogenic transformation, especially in highly aggressive tumors (42, 43). For example, constitutive activation of signal
transduction pathways (e.g., oncogenic activation of Ras or c-Myc)
was shown to lead to continuous up-regulation of key elements of
the translational machinery (42). Tumor cells apparently exhibit
increased amounts of eIF2a (42) and elevation of global translation
initiation (42).
An interesting reported finding was that an increase in the ratio
of unphosphorylated to phosphorylated eIF2a facilitates protein
synthesis, cell proliferation, and neoplastic transformation (42).
Phosphorylation of eIF2a in E2F1 / murine embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) in response to ER stress was recently shown to be enhanced
relative to wild-type MEFs (44). Thus, E2F1 deficiency might lead to
a decrease in general translation (44). Because FTS decreases E2F1
in cancer cells (6, 34), this is yet another mechanism through which
FTS would block overall translation in such cells.
Enrichment in the group of transcription factors that were upregulated by FTS was highest for Bach2, suggesting that inhibition
of Ras and its pathways might result in up-regulation and/or
activation of Bach2 (see scheme, Fig. 5). Bach2 was recently shown
to be phosphorylated by PI3K/AKT/p70S6K (45). Phosphorylation
of Bach2 by p70S6K leads to retention of Bach2 in the cytoplasm,
whereas its dephosphorylation leads to its accumulation in the
nucleus, where it induces expression of genes involved in apoptosis
(45). It is likely, therefore, that inhibition of the Ras/PI3K/AKT/
p70S6K pathway by FTS promoted the increase in Bach2-regulated
genes observed in this study (Supplementary Table S4; see scheme,
Fig. 5).
Another interesting reported finding was that the transcription
and protein expression of Bach2 is negatively regulated by the
BCR/ABL oncogene, which also activates Ras and its signaling in

BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells (46). Inhibition of BCR/ABL by
Gleevec indeed induced up-regulation of Bach2 at both the
transcript and the protein levels. Similarly, both U0126 (MAPK/
ERK kinase inhibitor) and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) up-regulated
Bach2 expression in BCR/ABL-positive lines (46). Other studies
showed that Bach2 is induced by oxidative stress (47). As
mentioned above, ATF4 is also induced by oxidative stress. Unlike
ATF4, however, which enables cells to manage stress conditions as
part of the protective response (38, 48), expression of Bach2 is
thought to be associated with suppression of the mechanisms that
guard cells against oxidative stress (49).
Because FTS seems to increase both ATF4- and Bach2-regulated
genes, it is possible that the Ras inhibitor concomitantly causes
overall inhibition of translation and stress-associated cell death. The
balance between the effects of these two transcription factors might
conceivably determine the fate of cancer cell under the stressful
conditions apparently imposed on them by FTS. In some cells, the
effects of Bach2 will dominate, leading to cell death, whereas in
others ATF4 will dominate and protect the cells from death.
In summary, the gene expression profiling data described here
provide substantial support for the conclusion that FTS specifically
reregulates defective Ras pathways in human tumor cells and
strongly suggest that cancer patients with deregulated Ras pathway
tumors might benefit from FTS (salirasib) treatment.
