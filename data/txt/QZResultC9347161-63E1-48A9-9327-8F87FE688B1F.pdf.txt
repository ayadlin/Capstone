Abstract
Chronic liver inflammation is a critical component of hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, inflammatory mediators
are believed to promote liver cancer by upholding compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes in response to
tissue damage. However, inflammation can also mediate the depletion of malignant cells, but the difference
between tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting inflammation is not defined at the molecular level. Here, we
analyzed the role of the major inflammatory mediator IFN-g in chemical hepatocarcinogenesis of transgenic
mice that overexpress IFN-g in the liver; these mice manifest severe chronic inflammatory liver damage and
lasting compensatory regeneration. We found that chronic exposure to IFN-g suppressed chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, despite overt liver injury. Indeed, IFN-g–transgenic mice had significantly fewer and significantly
less advanced malignant lesions than nontransgenic mice. This tumor-suppressive effect of IFN-g seemed to be
mediated in part by its known immune activating function, indicated by infiltration of IFN-g–transgenic livers
with CD8 T cells, natural killer T cells, and natural killer cells. However, IFN-g seemed to prevent carcinogenesis
also by activating the cell-intrinsic p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Indeed, exposure to IFN-g in vivo or in vitro
was associated with accumulation of p53 in hepatocytes and the sensitization of hepatocytes to apoptosis
induced by genotoxic stress. The IFN-g–induced increase in apoptosis of hepatocytes seemed to be p53
dependent. Thus, chronic inflammation dominated by IFN-g may prevent hepatocarcinogenesis, despite
continued inflammatory liver injury and regeneration. Therefore, the carcinogenic potential of inflammation
seems to be determined by type and composition of its mediators and manipulating the type of chronic
inflammation may serve the prevention of cancer. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3763–71. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation of tissue is believed to predispose to
the formation of cancer (1). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
which is one of the 5 most common and most lethal tumors
worldwide (2, 3), may serve as a paradigm for inflammationinduced cancer. Indeed, HCC develops most frequently on
grounds of cirrhosis after years of chronic hepatitis, independent
of what had caused this condition (2, 3). However, how chronic

inflammation is linked to carcinogenesis at the molecular level
is not entirely clear. Recent findings indicate that inflammatory
mediators, which cause tissue injury, may promote carcinogenesis by inducing compensatory proliferation and regeneration
(4, 5), and the chronic stimulation of aberrant cells with inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6; refs. 6, 7) or TNF-a
(8) was found to promote carcinogenesis.
A major inflammatory pathway that may modulate carcinogenesis is the IFN-g/STAT1 pathway (9). However, the
role of IFN-g, which is secreted by inflammatory cells, in
carcinogenesis is not clear. On the one hand, IFN-g signaling
has been shown to suppress carcinogenesis in vivo, because
a lack of IFN-g receptors or STAT1 molecules, which are the
major signal transducers of IFN-g, promotes carcinogenesis
(10–13). It is believed that the anticarcinogenic activity of
IFN-g is mediated mainly by enhancing tumor cell immunogenicity and cancer immunosurveillance (12). On the other
hand, however, sustained STAT1 signaling was reported to
be associated with the development of liver cancer (14).
Indeed, a lack of or silencing of suppressor of cytokine
signaling (SOCS)-1, which is an endogenous inhibitor of the
IFN-g/STAT1 pathway (15), was found to promote IFNg–dependent carcinogenesis (16–18). However, SOCS-1 also

interferes with other cytokine pathways, notably with the IL-6/
STAT3 pathway; therefore, the exact role of sustained IFN-g
signaling in hepatocarcinogenesis is not established.
To explore the role of IFN-g in hepatocarcinogenesis, we
used the model of IFN-g–transgenic mice that overexpress
IFN-g in the liver under control of the human serum amyloid
P component gene promoter (19). These mice manifest significant hepatic IFN-g levels, lifelong chronic hepatitis, continuous liver injury, and consecutive chronic regeneration
(19); it is believed that such a chronic state of regenerative
hepatocyte proliferation under inflammatory stress constitutes a major risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis (4, 5). Because
these mice are not prone to spontaneous liver cancer, we
induced chemical hepatocarcinogenesis by application of
diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and phenobarbital (4).
Despite chronic inflammation and sustained IFN-g signaling, the IFN-g–transgenic mice were resistant to chemically
induced liver cancer. This protection from liver cancer was
associated with IFN-g–induced accumulation of the p53
molecule and the sensitization of damaged hepatocytes to
apoptosis. Our findings indicate that (i) the activation the p53
pathway and apoptosis of damaged hepatocytes by IFN-g may
be a relevant mechanism that limits hepatocarcinogenesis,
and (ii) chronic inflammation dominated by IFN-g can protect
from liver cancer, despite continued compensatory regeneration of inflammatory liver damage. Thus, chronic inflammation need not be tumorigenic and the carcinogenic potential
of hepatic inflammation may be determined by the type of its
mediators rather than by mere chronicity.

p53, cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), or p21 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

Materials and Methods

Analysis of intrahepatic infiltrates
Nonparenchymal liver cells from perfused mouse livers
were prepared as described (21), and the included hepatic
inflammatory cells were then stained with fluorescencelabeled antibody to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, or NK1.1 (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Mice
SAP-IFN-g–transgenic or nontransgenic C57BL/6 mice
were bred and kept in a specific pathogen-free animal facility
at the Johannes Gutenberg University (Mainz, Germany) or at
the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. The
experiments were approved by the institutional animal experimentation committee. Liver carcinogenesis was induced in
male mice by neonatal application of DEN (5 mg/kg at day 10
after birth) and subsequently promoted by phenobarbital
(0.05% in drinking water). The p53/ mice for the preparation of p53/ hepatocytes were obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory.
Histology
At the indicated time points, mice were sacrificed and the
livers were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 2 mm, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. At least 6 representative sections of
each liver were evaluated by a senior hepatopathologist in a
blinded fashion (P. Schirmacher). Tumor burden was determined as the number of lesions per centimeter (2) and as
total lesion area (%). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was done
with the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche); cells were
counterstained with Hoechst 33258 nuclear dye (Invitrogen).
Immunohistologic staining was carried out with antibody to

3764

Western blot
Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysis in HEPES buffered
saline with 1% Triton X-100 containing proteinase/phosphatase inhibitors. Liver lysates were prepared from snap-frozen
tissue in T-Per (Pierce) with proteinase/phosphatase inhibitors. Protein was separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &
Schuell). After incubation with 5% dry nonfat milk, membranes
were probed with primary antibodies and appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies [all from
Cell Signaling except antibodies to actin, p53, p21, Cyclin D1,
and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology)]. Detection was done by using an ECL kit (Roth)
Cell culture
Primary hepatocytes were isolated as described (20) and
stimulated with 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse IFN-g (PeproTech), 30 or 60 mmol/L cisplatin, 200 mmol/L DEN (both from
Sigma), or 50 mmol/L Pifithrin-a (Calbiochem) as indicated.
Cell survival was measured by adding 0.5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma)
for 2 hours. The supernatant was removed, the tetrazolium
dye dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and absorbance was
measured at 570 nm. Results shown are means of quadruple
experiments. Alternatively, cell survival was determined by
counting alive and dead cells after trypan blue staining in at
least 6 microscope fields per cell culture sample.

Results
Sustained activation of STAT1 suppresses chemical
hepatocarcinogenesis
Liver protein extracts of 6- or 12-week-old nontransgenic or
IFN-g–transgenic mice were assessed by Western blot for
activity of the IFN-g/STAT1 pathway and markers of regenerative hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 1A). The nontransgenic
mice did not show STAT1 phosphorylation at the age of 6 or 12
weeks. In contrast, IFN-g–transgenic mice showed continued
upregulation and activation of STAT1, both at 6 and 12 weeks
of age. The degree of STAT3 activation was considerably
higher in the IFN-g–transgenic mice than in nontransgenic
mice, both at 6 or 12 weeks of age. Furthermore, the lysates
from IFN-g–transgenic livers, taken at 6 or 12 weeks of age,
contained higher amounts of the proliferation markers PCNA
and cyclin D1 than those of nontransgenic mice. These findings showed that IFN-g signaling in the transgenic mice was
continuously active and not silenced, and that the IFNg–transgenic livers were characterized by continued regenerative proliferation.

Figure 1. Sustained STAT1 signaling and regenerative proliferation in IFNg–transgenic mice. A, the livers of 6- or 12-week-old IFN-g–transgenic or
nontransgenic mice were analyzed for activity of the STAT1 and STAT3
signaling pathways and markers of regenerative proliferation (cyclin D1,
PCNA). In contrast to nontransgenic mice, the STAT1 pathway was
continuously active and not silenced in IFN-g–transgenic mice. Moreover,
IFN-g–transgenic livers were marked by continued regenerative
proliferation. B, primary nontransgenic hepatocytes were stimulated with
IFN-g, which induced continued STAT1 activation for at least 48 hours; in
contrast, STAT3 activation, which was also induced by IFN-g, was silenced
after 6 hours.

To confirm these in vivo findings, we assessed in vitro the
response of primary hepatocytes from nontransgenic mice to
stimulation by IFN-g (Fig. 1B). IFN-g induced the rapid
upregulation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 within 1
hour. STAT3 activation was silenced after 12 hours; STAT1
activation, in contrast, continued for at least 48 hours. These

findings are in agreement with the continuously activated
IFN-g signaling found in vivo (Fig. 1A).
We then induced chemical hepatocarcinogenesis in nontransgenic or IFN-g–transgenic mice by neonatal application
of DEN, which was subsequently promoted by application of
phenobarbital in drinking water. Cancer development in
DEN-treated mice was assessed histologically after 40 weeks,
because by then 2 mice in the group of nontransgenic mice
already had died from liver cancer. The livers of IFNg–transgenic mice (n ¼ 22) had significantly fewer
(Fig. 2A; P < 0.0001) and smaller lesions (Fig. 2B; P <
0.0001) than those of the nontransgenic mice (n ¼ 14).
Representative histologic sections of IFN-g–transgenic mice
(Fig. 2C) show mild portal inflammation and mild perivenular fatty change, but lack of premalignant or malignant
changes. Representative histologic sections of nontransgenic
mice (Fig. 2D) show a premalignant eosinophilic (dysplastic)
nodule without signs of cytologic atypia, increased proliferation, or invasive growth. Moreover, carcinogenesis
seemed to be delayed in the IFN-g–transgenic mice compared with the nontransgenic mice (Table 1). Indeed, significantly fewer IFN-g–transgenic mice had premalignant
dysplastic nodules (Table 1; P ¼ 0.0017), and significantly
fewer IFN-g–transgenic mice had malignant lesions (HCC;
Table 1; P ¼ 0.0002), with an OR of 25 for the nontransgenic
mice versus IFN-g–transgenic mice to develop liver cancer
(95% confidence interval; 3.89–160.57). Therefore, activation
of the IFN-g/STAT1 pathway in IFN-g–transgenic mice
seemed to protect from chemical hepatocarcinogenesis,
despite continuous liver injury and regeneration.
IFN-g–induced regulation of p53 activity
The question then was how IFN-g induced protection from
chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Because IFN-g has been
shown to increase MHC expression and the immunogenicity
of aberrant cells, IFN-g may have indirectly activated cancer
immunosurveillance by tumor-reactive lymphocytes (11, 12).
Indeed, there was a strong and significant accumulation of
both CD8 T cells and natural killer T cells (NKT) in the livers
of IFN-g–transgenic mice, with an increase of the CD8 T-cell
percentage among the intrahepatic lymphocytes from 11% in
wild-type mice to 32% in IFN-g–transgenic mice (P ¼ 0.0002),
and an increase in the percentage of NKT cells from 4% in
wild-type mice to 24% in IFN-g–transgenic mice (P ¼ 0.0002).
To a lesser degree, there was also an increase in NK cells in the
livers of IFN-g–transgenic mice (2% in wild-type mice vs. 4% in
IFN-g–transgenic mice; P ¼ 0.0002), whereas CD4 T cells did
not accumulate (11% in wild-type mice vs. 9% in IFNg–transgenic mice; P ¼ 0.3282). Thus, it was possible that
IFN-g–induced protection from malignancy was related to
indirect activation of immune cells.
However, it has been observed in vitro that IFN-g signaling in
hepatocytes can induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis (22, 23).
Thus, it was also possible that IFN-g–induced protection from
malignancy was related to direct effects of IFN-g on hepatocytes. Indeed, it has been reported that activated STAT1 can
regulate p53 activation (24, 25); the p53 molecule functions to
inhibit the growth of aberrant cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest

or IFN-g–transgenic mice (Fig. 4A). Indeed, IFN-g–transgenic
mice had accumulated p53 irrespective of DEN treatment;
nontransgenic mice, in contrast did not exhibit p53 accumulation. DEN exposure itself did not seem to modulate STAT1
or STAT3 activation (Fig. 4A). The STAT1-induced p53
accumulation in IFN-g–transgenic mice was associated with
elevated p53 activity, as shown by the induction of the p21
molecule and cleavage of caspase-3 (Fig. 4A). IFN-g–induced
p53 activity seemed to be modulated by DEN. DEN-treated
mice displayed higher amounts of cleaved caspase-3, indicative of apoptosis, whereas untreated mice showed higher
levels of p21, indicative of growth arrest. Thus, IFN-g signaling

had not been stimulated with IFN-g, with DEN, or cisplatin
(Fig. 3B); this application of genotoxic stress reduced the
expression of p21, a marker of growth arrest, and induced
cleavage of caspase-3, indicating apoptosis. These findings
showed that IFN-g signaling induced p53 activation in hepatocytes and additional genotoxic stress shifted p53 activity
from predominant growth arrest to predominant apoptosis.

may induce p53 accumulation and activation, and the additional presence of genotoxic stress may shift p53 activity from
predominant growth arrest to apoptosis.
To confirm that apoptosis of hepatocytes was induced by
IFN-g signaling in combination with genotoxic stress, we
conducted TUNEL assays on liver sections of nontransgenic
and IFN-g–transgenic mice 6 days after treatment with DEN
(Fig. 4B). Hepatocytes of IFN-g–transgenic mice displayed
significantly higher rates of apoptosis than those of nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4B; P < 0.0001); moreover, exposure to DEN
significantly further increased the incidence of apoptosis
in hepatocytes of IFN-g–transgenic mice (P < 0.0001). A
representative TUNEL stain is shown in Figure 5A.
To further confirm that IFN-g signaling had induced p53
activation in hepatocytes in vivo, we treated nontransgenic or

3768

Cancer Res; 71(11) June 1, 2011

IFN-g–transgenic mice with DEN and obtained the livers after 6
days. We then stained liver sections by histochemistry for p53
(Fig. 5B), p21 (Fig. 5C), and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5D). In
contrast to nontransgenic hepatocytes, hepatocytes of IFNg–transgenic mice displayed considerable accumulation of
p53 and cleavage of caspase-3, notably when treated with
DEN. Moreover, there was considerable expression of p21 in
IFN-g–transgenic hepatocytes, which was reduced after DEN
treatment; nontransgenic hepatocytes did not express p21.
These in vivo findings are in full agreement with the in vitro
findings of Fig. 3.
To further substantiate these in vivo findings, we analyzed the
survival of primary hepatocytes from nontransgenic mice in vitro,
after stimulation with IFN-g and in response to DNA damage

cisplatin (Fig. 6B, white columns). In concordance with the in vivo
findings, IFN-g and genotoxic stress synergistically reduced the
survival of hepatocytes (P < 0.05). The induced hepatocyte death
seemed to be p53 dependent, because it was prevented by the
p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-a (ref. 27; Fig. 6A and B; black columns).
To further test the p53 dependence of the induced hepatocyte
death, we analyzed in vitro the survival of primary hepatocytes
from p53/ mice or wild-type mice in response to incubation with IFN-g and DEN (Fig. 6C) or cisplatin (Fig. 6D). In agreement with the findings above, IFN-g and genotoxic stress
synergistically reduced the survival of wild-type hepatocytes
(white columns; P < 0.02) but not of p53/ hepatocytes (black
columns; P > 0.5). These findings indicated that IFN-g/STAT1
signaling to hepatocytes may suppress liver cancer by p53dependent inhibition of the outgrowth of premalignant cells.

depend on the cell type and cytokine composition of the
tumor-associated inflammatory reaction (28). The role of
IFN-g in this respect has been controversial; both tumorpromoting and tumor-suppressive functions of IFN-g have
been reported (11, 18). On the one hand, IFN-g may function
as a tumor promoter by stimulating the release of inflammatory mediators that may advance carcinogenesis, such as
TNF-a, reactive oxygen species, or nitric oxide (28, 29); on
the other hand, IFN-g may function as a tumor suppressor by
enhancing tumor cell immunogenicity and cancer immunosurveillance (12). The role of IFN-g in hepatocarcinogenesis
is further complicated by its antifibrotic effects, which may
also influence carcinogenesis. Indeed, a liver cancer model
that is associated with severe liver fibrosis showed a mild
reduction in lesion numbers in mice lacking the IFN-g
receptor (30).
To clarify the role of IFN-g in hepatocarcinogenesis, we
used liver-specific IFN-g–transgenic mice; the livers of these
mice are marked by continuous inflammation, injury, and
compensatory regeneration in the absence of fibrosis.
Regenerating hepatocytes under chronic inflammatory
stress are believed to be prone to malignant transformation

(4, 5). However, despite chronic inflammation and regeneration, the IFN-g–transgenic mice were significantly less susceptible to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis (Fig. 2 and
Table 1); the OR of nontransgenic mice versus IFNg–transgenic mice to develop liver cancer was 25. This is
in agreement with the earlier finding that IFN-g–insensitive
mice, which either were IFN-g receptor deficient or STAT1
deficient, exhibited increased development of chemically
induced skin cancer (10). In skin cancer, IFN-g seemed to
act by increasing tumor immune surveillance by lymphocytes (10, 11). We find the livers of IFN-g–transgenic mice
strongly infiltrated mainly by CD8 T cells and NKT cells and,
to a lesser degree, by CD4 T cells and NK cells. At least CD8
T cells and NK cells are capable of depleting malignant
cells; indeed, it has been reported that IFN-g–driven accumulation of NK cells in established tumors seems to correlate with survival (31). Thus, it is conceivable that the
protection from malignancy mediated by IFN-g was related
to IFN-g–enhanced cytotoxicity of immune cells.
However, in addition to its indirect effects on malignant
cells by activating cancer immune surveillance, we find that
IFN-g could also directly induce depletion of premalignant
cells by activating the cell-intrinsic p53 tumor suppressor
pathway. Indeed, we find that IFN-g signaling to damaged
hepatocytes seemed to modify the acute damage response
by activation of the p53 pathway, resulting in sensitization to
apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (Figs. 3, 4, and 5).
Although damage-induced cell death of hepatocytes seemed
to depend only partly on p53, there was a consistent increase
in cell death induced by IFN-g, and this increase was
consistently lost in the absence of p53 activity (Fig. 6). Thus,
our findings indicate a tumor-suppressive role of IFN-g at
early stages of carcinogenesis by the induction of apoptosis
in damaged cells. Because lymphocytes are the most important physiologic source of IFN-g in nontransgenic mice and
in humans, it is possible that IFN-g secretion is an important
cancer-preventing activity of lymphocytes, independent of
their cytolytic activity.
It has been reported that IFN-g may promote colorectal
carcinogenesis in SOCS-1–deficient mice, which manifest
hyperactivation of the STAT1 pathway, by inducing expression of COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (18).
Indeed, colorectal carcinogenesis in SOCS-1–deficient mice
could be abrogated by blockade of IFN-g (18). Because
silencing of the SOCS-1 gene by methylation has been
observed in liver cancer (16, 17), a lack of SOCS-1 activity
and STAT1 hyperactivity may also promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, SOCS-1þ/ mice are more susceptible to
chemical hepatocarcinogenesis than SOCS-1þ/þ mice (17),
suggesting that STAT1 hyperactivation due to a lack of

SOCS-1 activity may promote carcinogenesis. However, this
observation is seemingly in contrast to our finding that
chronic STAT1 activation in IFN-g–transgenic mice was
associated with suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis. One
explanation for this divergence could be that SOCS-1 does
not only interfere with the STAT1 pathway but also with
other cytokine pathways, such as the STAT3 pathway (15);
therefore, the tumor-promoting effect of SOCS-1 deficiency
may depend on STAT3 rather than STAT1 signals. Indeed,
the STAT3 pathway has been identified as a critical driver
of carcinogenesis (32, 33), and tumor progression may be
determined by the balance of STAT1 and STAT3 signals
(34). Although IFN-g stimulated both STAT1 and STAT3
(Fig. 1B), the STAT1 pathway in hepatocytes stimulated
with IFN-g seemed to be continuously activated, whereas
the STAT3 signal seemed to be rather transient (Fig. 1B).
Taken together, our findings indicate that chronic inflammation and compensatory regeneration are not necessarily
oncogenic, and that the type of inflammation, notably the
proportion of IFN-g–secreting lymphocytes in chronic inflammatory tissue infiltrates, may determine the carcinogenic
potential of chronic inflammation. Indeed, one may speculate
that these findings could explain the clinical observation that
some chronic inflammatory conditions, such as viral hepatitis,
confer a high risk of progression to cancer, whereas in other
inflammatory conditions, such as autoimmune hepatitis, progression to cancer is uncommon. Our findings further indicate
that inflammatory IFN-g/STAT1 signaling to damaged cells,
in addition to indirectly activating cancer immune surveillance (12), may also directly activate the cell-intrinsic p53
tumor suppressor pathway. Our findings seem to indicate that
the IFN-g–promoted apoptosis of hepatocytes can be an
efficient barrier to hepatocarcinogenesis.
