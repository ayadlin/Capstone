ABSTRACT
Paclitaxel is a first-line microtubule-stabilizing drug in treating prostate
cancer. However, most patients develop resistance and experience relapse. Morin
(3,5,7,20,40-pentahydroxyflavone) is an anti-tumor flavonoid in a numerous types
of cancer cells including breast, ovarian and lung cancers. We therefore researched
the effects of morin as an adjuvant to paclitaxel in in treating DU145 and PC-3 cells in
vitro and DU145 derived prostate cancers in nude mice models. The chemosensitivities
of these cells to the treatments of morin and paclitaxel were tested through viability
assays utilizing cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and apoptosis assays through flow
cytometry analyses. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray was employed to determine the
changes in miRNA profile of morin treated DU145 cells. The results from microarrays
were further certified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR).
The underlying targets of miR-155 were verified using luciferase assays followed by
Western blot assays. In the results, morin was capable of repressing the cell viabilities
in the paclitaxel-treated cells. MiR-155might be an effective target that can be downregulated in morin-treated cells. We also discovered that GATA binding protein 3
(GATA3) was directly repressed by miR-155, and the treatment of morin reversed the
expression of GATA3. In conclusion, morin might be a potential adjuvant of paclitaxel
in treating prostate cancer through regulating miR-155/GATA3 axis.

Therefore, it is important to develop new methods to
conquer the drug resistance. By now, it is clear that
alterations in the expressions of microtubule subtypes and
the subsequent cell signaling could influence the affinity of
the drug and the downstream response of the cell [3]. Hence,
combination therapy might be efficient to prevent drug
resistance through altering the microtubule expressions.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding
RNAs (19-25 nt) that modulate the translation of mRNAs

INTRODUCTION
Paclitaxel, an alkaloid originally discovered in
pacific yew tree, has long been used as a first-line treatment
of prostate cancer. The antitumor effect of paclitaxel has
been attributed to mitotic arrest, in which microtubule
is stabilized to prevent chromosome segregation and
cytokinesis [1]. However, most patients rapidly develop
resistance to paclitaxel and experience relapse [2].

through binding to its 3’-untranslated region (UTR)
[4]. Studies have shown that each tumor type has a
distinct miRNA profile that correlates to their relevant
subtypes, patient survivals and treatment responses
in different cancers [5]. This provides a convenient
method to understand the efficacies of drugs on tumor
cells and their molecular mechanisms. MiR-155 is a
multi-functional miRNA that participates in innate and
acquired immune responses and hematopoiesis [6, 7].
MiR-155 dysregulation has been reported in numerous
malignant tumors including leukemia, breast and lung
cancers [8, 9]. Recent data has shown that miR-155 can
be markedly overexpressed in prostate cancer cells [10,
11]. Researches have demonstrated that miR-155 could
promote cell proliferation, enhance tumor growth and
inhibit apoptosis through suppressing the expression
of proteins like TP53INP1, VHL, PIK3RI [12–14].
Nevertheless, the understandings of the mechanisms of
miR-155 in promoting the progression of cancers, and
researches investigating the effects of miR-155 to prostate
cancer are limited.
Morin (3,5,7,20,40-pentahydroxyflavone) is a
flavonoid isolated from figs and other members of
Moraceae family. In recent studies, morin has exhibited
effects on regulating cell survival and proliferation-related
genes, promoting apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity in
multiple cancer cell lines [15–17]. Researches have shown
that morin can upregulate intrinsic apoptosis pathways
[15, 17, 18]. In breast cancer cells, 50 μM of morin was
effective in reverting their malignant phenotypes [19].
Therefore, we hypothesized that 50 μM of morin can
be an effective adjuvant of paclitaxel in delaying the
development of drug resistance. Experiments in vivo and
in vitro showed that morin increased the chemo-sensitivity
to paclitaxel. The results of miRNA microarray revealed
that miR-155 was significantly repressed by treatment of
morin. GATA binding protein 3(GATA3) was significantly
downregulated by miR-155.

limited within 48 h of treatment (Figure 1A and 1B; all P <
0.01). The cell viabilities of both cell lines were influenced
only after 72 h treatment comparing with the DMSO
control (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B; all P < 0.01).
However, when paclitaxel was treated at the same time,
the viabilities of morin-treated groups in both of the cell
lines were significantly lower than DMSO control groups
in both the time points of 48 h and 72 h (Figure 1A and
1B; Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B; all P < 0.01). These
results were then verified by measuring relative apoptosis
rates using flow cytometry in PC-3 and DU145 cell lines,
in which cells were treated with 50 μM morin and 50
nM paclitaxel for 48 h. Similar to the results in viability
assay, morin led to significant increase in cell apoptosis
compared with DMSO treatment in both of the cell lines
(Figure 1C and 1D; both P < 0.01).

RESULTS

The miRNA profiles of morin and DMSO treated
DU145 cells was analyzed to understand how prostate
cancer cells were inhibited by morin. A total of 39
microRNAs were found to be altered in morin treated
cells, with the most significant one being miR-155
(Figure 3A). Then we assessed the effect of morin on
the intracellular concentrations of miR-155 in DU145
and PC-3 cell by qRT-PCR. The results revealed that the
transcription of miR-155 was both reduced in morintreated cells compared with control cells (Figure 3B, both
P < 0.01).

Morin promotes chemo-sensitivity of prostate
cancer cells to paclitaxel in vivo
We investigated the inhibitory function of morin
as an adjuvant to paclitaxel in treating DU145 derived
prostate cancer in nude mice models, in which nude mice
were divided into paclitaxel treated, morin and paclitaxel
treated and DMSO control groups (4 nude mice for each
group at indicated time point). DU145 cells were injected
into both sides of posterior flank of nude mice. Paclitaxel
(50 μg/kg) and morin (50 mg/kg) were injected by tail
vein injection every day for 15 days. Since the day of
injection, the tumor sizes were determined every two
days, and tumors were excised and weighed after 20 days
(Figure 2A–2C). Both the data of tumor size and weight
indicated that morin significantly promoted the anti-tumor
function of paclitaxel during the process of prostate cancer
development in vivo.

cancer cells

Morin promotes chemo-sensitivity of prostate
cancer cells to paclitaxel
DU145 and PC-3 cell lines are standard models that
have been widely used in studying prostate cancers. Hence
they are more universal comparing to cell lines derived
from patients. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of morin as an
adjuvant to paclitaxel, we firstly evaluated the viabilities
of DU145 and PC-3 cells in the environment of morin
and paclitaxel using CCK-8 kit. In the experiments, cells
were cultured in the medium containing 50 μM morin
dissolved in DMSO and a gradient of paclitaxel (0-100
nM) for 48 h (Figure 1) and 72 h (Supplementary Figure
1). The same amount of DMSO was treated in control
groups. The cytotoxicity of 50 μM morin alone was

anti-miR-155 into DU145 and PC-3 cells. Anti-miR-NC
was transfected in the control group. The transfected cells
were incubated with paclitaxel (0-100 nM) for 24 h, and
CCK-8 kit was subsequently employed to determine the
viabilities of these cells. In both cell lines, the viability of
miR-155 silenced cells was lower than the control groups
(Figure 4A and 4B, all P < 0.01). Apoptosis assays showed
that miR-155 silenced cells exhibited elevated percentages

of apoptosis cells compared with control cells (Figure 4C
and 4D, both P < 0.01).

Overexpression of miR-155 reverses the effects
of morin on tumor cells
To understand if miR-155 is directly regulated by
morin when it acts as an adjuvant to paclitaxel, miR155 was overexpressed in DU145 and PC-3 cells. To

GATA3 was a downstream effector of miR-155

do this, miR-155 mimics were transfected to increase
the intracellular level of miR-155, and miR-NC were
transfected as control. Transfected cells were then
incubated with or without 50 μM morin and 0-100 nM
paclitaxel at 37°C. After 48 h of treatments, the viabilities
of cells treated with morin were notably decreased when
comparing with the control cells treated with DMSO in
both cell lines (Figure 5A and 5B; all P < 0.01). However,
the transfection of miR-155 mimics rallied the degree
of apoptosis to the level similar to the control group
(Figure 5A and 5B; all P < 0.01). These results were
consistent with them from apoptosis assays, which were
performed on cells pre-treated with 50 nM paclitaxel. In
the experiments, the transfection of miR-155 in morin
treated cells reversed the degree of apoptosis to a lower
level (Figure 5C and 5D, all P < 0.01).

We performed in silico analyses to determine the
underlying targets of miR-155 through Targetscan (http://
www.targetscan.org/vert_71/) and miRWalk (http://zmf.
umm.uni-heidelberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk2/, Figure 6A).
Among the 5348 genes evaluated, we found that 3 genes,
PAK2, XRN1 and GATA3 contained most potential as
targets of miR-155 (Figures 6A and 6B). The transcription
of these proteins in miR-155 mimic transfected DU145
cells and control cells were then analyzed through qRTPCR. The expressions of all of the three proteins were
suppressed in different degree. However, the suppression
effect of miR-155 mimic to PAK2 and XRN1 were limited
comparing to its effects to GATA3. (Figure 6B; P < 0.01).
To understand if GATA3 is directly regulated by miR-

155, the 3’-UTR of GATA3 was mutated to a sequence
that cannot complement miR-155, and Luciferase reporter
assays were employed in DU145 cell lines transfected with
miR-155 mimics or miR-NC (Figure 6C). We observed
that the luciferase activities of wild type GATA3 3’-UTR,
but not mutated GATA3 3’-UTR, were notably suppressed
in cells with enhanced miR-155 mimics (Figure 6D, P <
0.01). In spite of this, the expression of GATA-3 in these
cells were analyzed by Western blotting, in which miR155 mimics decreased the GATA3 expression level in both
cell lines in comparison to the control group (Figure 6E).

morin and paclitaxel. Firstly, the expressions of GATA3
were significantly decreased in prostate cancer tissues
(Supplementary Figure 3, P<0.01), and the overexpression
of GATA3 has been demonstrated to increase the
chemosensitivity of DU145 and PC-3 cells to paclitaxel
(Supplementary Figure 4, P<0.01). We subsequently
evaluated the influences of morin and paclitaxel on the
expressions of GATA3 in DU145 and PC-3 cell lines.
The treatment of paclitaxel or morin alone elevated the
expression of GATA3, and morin enhanced the effects of
paclitaxel (Supplementary Figure 2, Figure 6F). The next
step was to evaluate how morin regulated the expression
of miR-155. The cellular level of GATA3 in morin treated
miR-155 mimic transfected or control DU145 and PC-3
cells were compared through western blotting, in which
the elevated expressions of GATA3 under the treatment
of morin were inhibited by miR-155 mimics. We further

demonstrated that the relative expression levels of all of
the downstream modulators of GATA3 including ZEB2,
TGFB1 and MDM2 were inhibited (Supplementary Figure

miR-155/GATA3 axis involved in the treatment of morin.

its early stage, the median survival in man with advanced
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is less
than 2 years [20]. Paclitaxel is the only Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved chemotherapy that is
effective in extending the overall survival of prostate
cancer patients [21]. This can be ascribed to the fact
that tumors easily acquire resistance to paclitaxel and
its derivatives (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) even with the
assistance of various adjuvants [21–23]. Recent study has
shown that prostate cancer even becomes more aggressive

cancer death in male worldwide. Though it is curable in

and invasive when it acquires paclitaxel resistance [24].
Hence it is crucial to develop new adjuvants to overcome
the drug resistance in prostate cancer. In the present study,
we demonstrate that morin may increase the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment
through modulating the expression of miR-155. We also
demonstrate that GATA3 may be an important protein
involved in the functions of miR-155 in tumor progression.
Morin is a flavonoid isolated from plants of
Moraceae family, and contains two aromatic rings linked
by an oxygen-containing heterocycle [25]. The anti-

tumor effects of morin are widely discovered in a variety
of cancers especially in breast cancer and leukemia [15,
18, 26–28]. It has been shown that morin is capable of
inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis
in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP [29, 30], which is
consistent with our results that morin repressed the cell
viability and enhanced apoptosis of both PC-3 and DU145
cell lines under the treatment of paclitaxel.
Studies have demonstrated that morin induces
apoptosis in cancer cell lines through intrinsic apoptosis
pathways [17, 18, 26, 27]. The decreased mitochondria

potential, the increased expression of caspase-3 and -9,
p21 and Bad proteins and the decreased expression of
Bcl-xL and STAT3 proteins were widely discovered [17,
18, 26]. Yet, mechanisms underlying the regulation of
morin on cell viabilities and apoptosis remain unclear.
In this research, we found 39 microRNAs that were
dysregulated after the treatment of morin including
miR-143, miR-146b, and miR-155. The downregulation
of miR-143 and miR-146b has been shown in all types
of prostate tumors, which is consistent with our results
[31]. However, the inhibitory effects of morin to these

two microRNAs were not as effective as miR-155 in our
study. The suppression of miR-155 was also discovered
the study of the influence of several isoflavones from
soy on prostate cancer cell lines, where miR-155, miR208b, miR-211, miR-376a and miR-411 were found to
be downregulated by the isoflavones by more than three
to five fold than control cells [32]. The upregulation of
miR-155 has been discovered in breast cancer cell lines
[10, 11]. In prostate cancer cells, miR-155 was capable of
upregulating annexin 7, which is a substrate of a variant of
kinases including protein kinase C involved in cell growth,

proliferation, apoptosis and migration [10]. Hence, the
function of miR-155 in the development of prostate cancer
might be underestimated.
The study of the targets of miR-155 in prostate
cancer is still limited comparing with other cancers. For
instance, in breast cancer at least 147 validated targets
have been identified [33]. However, in prostate cancer,
only a few downstream effectors of miR-155 have been
discovered yet. In present study, we found that GATA3
can be directly regulated by miR-155. GATA3 has been
shown highly expressed in normal human and mouse
prostates, which is involved in the regulation of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) genes [34, 35]. However, previous
researches have shown that its expression is negative in
prostate cancer cell lines [34]. In Pten-deficient prostate
tumors, the expression of GATA3 is gradually lost during
its progression [36]. This is consistent with our results
(Supplementary Figure 3). In one research 2-fold of
overexpression of GATA3 was effective enough to limit
the viabilities of PC-3 cells [37]. In our research we
demonstrated that the treatment of morin and/or paclitaxel
recovered the expression of GATA3 through inhibiting
the expression of miR-155. Researches have shown
that ZEB2, TGFB1, MDM2 are important downstream
effectors that can be inhibited by GATA3 in breast cancer
[38]. In our study, the treatment of morin alone raised the
expression of GATA3, and decreased the intracellular
levels of ZEB2, TGFB1, MDM2. Therefore it is possible
that there is a miR-155/GATA3 axis involved in the
antitumor effects of morin as an adjuvant to paclitaxel in
treating prostate cancer.
In conclusion, we hereby demonstrate that morin
may improve the chemo-sensitivity of prostate cancer cells
to paclitaxel through restoring the miR-155-suppressed
expression of GATA3. Hence, morin may be a promising
adjuvant to paclitaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer.

MiR-155 mimics, anti-miR-155 (Anti-miR-155),
miR-NC and anti-sense RNA (Anti-miR-NC) were
transfected into DU145 and PC-3 cell lines through
Ambion® Pre-miR™ miRNA Starter Kit (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, DE).

Cell viability assays
Cells were seeded and cultured in 96-well plates for
24 h. Paclitaxel (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, Mo, USA)
was then added into the culture media in the gradient
of 0 μM, 3.125 μM, 6.25 μM, 12.5 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM,
100 μM. The cell viability was determined after 48 h of
incubation using cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). In the cell viability
assay, 10 μl CCK-8 solution was added into each well
of the plate. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cell
viabilities were analyzed at dual wave lengths (450 nm
and 630 nm). The experiments were repeated for three
times.

Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis
Cells were cultured in 50 μM morin and 50
nM paclitaxel for 48 h, and then were harvested and
centrifuged. The centrifuged cells were then washed
twice utilizing cold PBS buffer and resuspended into the
concentration of 1×106 cells/mL. Annexin V Apoptosis
Detection kit (eBIOscience, San Diego, CA, USA)
was utilized for annexin V double staining. Annexin V
solution (5 μL) was mixed with100 μL cell suspensions,
The mixture were incubated at dark for 15 min, and the
cells were washed with 2 mL 1×binding buffer. The cells
were again suspended in 200 μL of 1×binding buffer 5
μL of Propidium Iodide Staining Solution was added
into solution before flow cytometry. Beckman Coulter
Cytomics FC 500 (San Jose, CA, USA) was employed for
flow cytometry analysis.

DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines were
purchased from Xinyu Biotechnology Co. Ltd (Shanghai,
China). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
(GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY) medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified air at 37°C with

through tail vein every day for 20days. Meanwhile, the
tumor sizes were measured every two days since tumors
can be apparently seen (Volume = 0.5 × Length × Width2).
Tumors were excised and weighted in the 20th day.

subsequently incubated with morin (50 μM) and
paclitaxel (0-100 nM) for 48 h. Proteins Cell lysates of
DU145/miR-155, DU145/miR-NC, PC-3/miR-155 and
PC-3/miR-NC cells treated with morin or not were then
separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were
then electrophoretically transferred onto NC membranes
(Sigma). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
milk in TBS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,) overnight. Antihuman GATA3 primary antibody purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, MA, USA) and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Abcam) were incubated
with the membrane. The antibodies were dissolved in
PBS buffer and diluted in the ration of 1:1000. Enhanced
Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Sigma-Aldrich) was
employed to detect the immunoreactive bands through
Chemigenius Bioimaging system (Syngene, Frederick
MD, USA.) GADPH (Abcam) was detected as loading
control.

Quantitative real time-PCR
The total RNA of DU145 and PC-3 cell lines was
reverse transcribed into first line cDNA with TaqMan
Reverse Transcription Reagents (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), which was then subject to Bio-Rad
CFX96 real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Primers were designed for different targets, and primers
designed for GAPDH and U6 were applied as internal
controls.:
miR-155:
  Sense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
  Antisense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
PAK2:
  Sense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
  Antisense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
XRN1:
  Sense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
  Antisense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
GATA3:
  Sense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,
  Antisense: 5’-AGCCTCCCGCTTCGCTCTCT-3’,

Statistical analysis
All data was analyzed using SPSS version 13.0
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The results were presented in
the formation of mean±standard deviation (SD). One or
two-way ANOVA analyses was employed for analyzing
statistical differences between multiple groups. Student T
tests were used to verify the significance of differences
between two groups. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical
significance.

GATA3 and GATA3 mute 3’ UTR were recombined
upstream of Firefly luciferase in one vector (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). The luciferase reporter vectors and
miR-155 mimics or miR-NC were transfected into DU145
and PC-3 cells. Renilla luciferase vector (Promega)
was transfected at the same time as internal control.
