Abstract
Metabolic heterogeneity is a key factor in cancer pathogenesis. We found that a subset of BRAF- and NRASmutant human melanomas resistant to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib displayed increased oxidative
phosphorylation (OxPhos) mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC1a. Notably, all selumetinibresistant cells with elevated OxPhos could be resensitized by cotreatment with the mTORC1/2 inhibitor
AZD8055, whereas this combination was ineffective in resistant cell lines with low OxPhos. In both BRAF- and
NRAS-mutant melanoma cells, MEK inhibition increased MITF expression, which in turn elevated levels of
PGC1a. In contrast, mTORC1/2 inhibition triggered cytoplasmic localization of MITF, decreasing PGC1a
expression and inhibiting OxPhos. Analysis of tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma
progressing on BRAF inhibitor  MEK inhibitor revealed that PGC1a levels were elevated in approximately
half of the resistant tumors. Overall, our ﬁndings highlight the signiﬁcance of OxPhos in melanoma and
suggest that combined targeting of the MAPK and mTORC pathways may offer an effective therapeutic
strategy to treat melanomas with this metabolic phenotype. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7037–47. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The identiﬁcation of frequent activating mutations in
BRAF (45%) and NRAS (15%–20%) has led to the clinical
development of MAPK pathway inhibitors for patients
with advanced melanoma (1). BRAF and MEK inhibitors
have gained regulatory approval for metastatic patients
with melanoma with activating BRAF mutations (2–4).
However, their activity varies markedly between patients,
and clinical responses are generally not durable (2, 5).
Hence, there is a critical need to determine and overcome

mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance to MAPK
pathway inhibitors.
Here, we present the results of a whole-genome siRNA
synthetic lethality screen to identify genes and networks that
may be targeted to overcome resistance to MAPK pathway
inhibitors. This and other approaches have identiﬁed increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) as a
mediator of resistance and a therapeutic target. OxPhos has
recently been linked in melanoma to the transcriptional
coactivator PGC1a, which is transcriptionally activated by
the lineage speciﬁc transcription factor MITF (6, 7). Our
analysis of both patient samples and cell lines presents new
data implicating OxPhos in acquired resistance to MAPK
pathway inhibitors, and identiﬁes a novel correlation with
sensitivity to mTORC1/2 inhibition. These ﬁndings add to
our understanding of the signiﬁcance of OxPhos in this
disease and suggest a potential personalized therapeutic
strategy to overcome it.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, plasmids, and inhibitors
Cell line authentication and BRAF/NRAS mutation detection
were previously described (8–10). Cells were grown in RPMI
media in 5% FBS. PGC1a promoter reporter was obtained from
Addgene. MITF and TRPM1 promoter reporters were obtained
from R. Haq (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; ref. 6).
Selumetinib (AZD6244/ARRY142886), AZD8055, and AZD2014
were from AstraZeneca, PLX4720 was from Plexxikon, and

Cell biologic studies
Cell proliferation assays and cell death analysis by ﬂow
cytometry cell-cycle analysis were performed as described
previously (14). IC50 and the combination index (CI) of inhibitors and combinations were determined using Calcusyn
software (Biosoft). Luciferase reporter assays were performed
following the manufacturer's instructions after transient transfections. Fugene 6 and Xtremegene were used for plasmid and
siRNA transfections, respectively.
In vivo xenograft growth assay
Xenograft tumors were generated with subcutaneous injections of 107 MEL624 cells per animal in the right ﬂank of Ncrnu/nu nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into
treatment groups of four mice each, and the indicated inhibitor
treatments were performed by oral gavage for 15 days. The
treatment groups consisted of vehicle (1% Tween-80, twice a
day), selumetinib (25 mg/kg twice a day), AZD2014 (20 mg/kg

Cellular metabolism analysis
Bioenergetics stress tests for oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) and extracellular acidiﬁcation rate were performed by
the Seahorse XF analyzer in 96-well plates using the manufacturer's protocol. Oligomycin and triﬂuorocarbonylcyanide
phenylhydrazone (FCCP) treatments were used to conﬁrm
oxygen uptake for mitochondrial OxPhos and to determine
mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, respectively. Data
were normalized against cell numbers. For glucose consumption and lactate release, cells were grown in 6-well plates for 24
hours, then media from the cells were collected and centrifuged at 12,000  g for 5 minutes. The supernatants were
transferred into 96-well plates, and the levels of glucose and
lactate were measured in a YSI biochemistry analyzer (YSI Life
Sciences). Cellular ATP levels were determined using the
Enliten ATP assay system (Promega).

mTORC1/2 Overcomes PGC1a and OxPhos-Mediated Resistance

networks that predominantly consisted of genes associated
with mitochondrial functions (Fig. 1B). Similar results were
obtained in screens with PLX4720 (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B).
To complement the siRNA screen the effects of selumetinib
on the MEL624 cells were examined by whole-genome transcriptional proﬁling. Selumetinib upregulated OxPhos genes
associated with all ﬁve complexes of the electron transport
chain (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). To further analyze
gene networks associated with selumetinib resistance, gene
expression proﬁling was then performed on BRAF-mutant,
PTEN-intact human melanoma cell lines previously characterized to undergo apoptosis (WM35 and A375; "sensitive") or
cell-cycle arrest only (MEL624 and SKMEL5; "resistant") after
selumetinib treatment. (14). IPA of canonical pathways identiﬁed elevated baseline expression of OxPhos genes in the
resistant cells (Fig. 1C). Analysis of expression of synthetic
lethal genes following treatment with selumetinib for 24 hours
identiﬁed 9 genes upregulated in both resistant cell lines but in
neither sensitive cell line (Fig. 1D). PPARGC1A, which encodes
PGC1a, showed the greatest induction following selumetinib
treatment among the synthetic lethal genes. PGC1a is a transcriptional coactivator that induces multiple genes involved
in mitochondrial OxPhos and increases mitochondrial biogenesis (18). Dynamic metabolic analysis using Seahorse extracellular ﬂux analyzer demonstrated that the resistant cell lines
had higher basal and maximal OCR (Fig. 1E). Resistant cells
had lower basal extracellular acidiﬁcation rates (ECAR), glucose consumption, and lactate release, and higher cellular
ATP levels, consistent with an OxPhos-predominant metabolic
phenotype (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C).
Elevated OxPhos and PGC1a are characteristic features
of a subset of MEK inhibitor-resistant melanomas that
are sensitive to concurrent mTORC1/2 inhibition
OCR was assessed in a collection of 14 de novo selumetinibresistant melanoma cell lines. Signiﬁcant variability in OCR
was detected among the cell lines (Fig. 2A). OCR did not
correlate with BRAF/NRAS mutational status, but it correlated
signiﬁcantly with PGC1a expression (Fig. 2A). In previous
experiments, the selumetinib-resistant, high OxPhos MEL624
and SKMEL5 cells lines demonstrated sensitivity to combined
treatment of selumetinib with AZD8055, a catalytic mTOR
inhibitor that inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes (14, 19). The growth inhibitory effects of AZD8055 
selumetinib were therefore tested in all 14 resistant cell
lines (Supplementary Table S3). IC50 and CIs (20) were determined, which showed that the combination was synergistic
(CI < 1.0) exclusively in the cell lines with high OxPhos, and
the CI correlated signiﬁcantly and inversely with OCR (Fig. 2B

and Supplementary Table S3). PGC1a (P ¼ 0.0013) and OCR
(P < 0.0001) levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the cell lines
with CI < 1.0 versus those with CI > 1.0 (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S4). FACS analysis of representative cell lines
showed that the combination induced cell death (sub-G1
cells) in 4 of 4 resistant cell lines with high OxPhos and 0 of
4 with low OxPhos (Fig. 2D). Synergistic apoptosis induction
with AZD8055 was also observed with the MEK inhibitor
trametinib and the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in MEL624 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
RPPA analysis did not show any differences in target
inhibition or known feedback effects (14, 19, 21) between
low and high OxPhos BRAF-mutant cell lines after treatment
with the combination or the individual inhibitors (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C). However, apoptosis markers
(cleaved caspases 3, 7, PARP) were increased in the high
OxPhos lines treated with the combination (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). This pattern of differential sensitivity was also observed in a pair of NRAS-mutant lines with
low (WM1361) and high (WM3854) OxPhos (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S6D).
Inhibition of mTOR1/2 decreases PGC1a expression
Similar to PGC1a, but less signiﬁcantly, MITF transcript
levels in the 14 cell line panel correlated with MEKi and
mTORC1/2i sensitivity and OCR (Supplementary Fig. S7A
and S7B). Selumetinib treatment markedly increased MITF
and PGC1a transcript levels in representative BRAF-mutant
(MEL624) and NRAS-mutant (WM3854) high OxPhos cell lines
(Fig. 4A and B), consistent with recently published data (6).
In contrast, AZD8055 inhibited basal and selumetinib-induced
PGC1a expression, and increased MITF expression (Fig. 4A
and B). Similar results to the effects on PGC1a were observed
for the MITF-regulated genes TRPM1, DCT, and TYR (Supplementary Fig. S7C and S7D), and Western blotting analysis
showed generally concordant changes in protein expression
(Inset Western blots in Fig. 4A and B). Selumetinib also increased reporter activity for MITF, TRPM1, and PGC1a promoters (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S7E). AZD8055
decreased the reporter activity of the TRPM1 and PGC1a
promoters only (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S7E).
Western blotting of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts
showed that AZD8055 treatment resulted in increased cytoplasmic and decreased nuclear MITF protein levels (Fig. 4E and
F). This was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
analysis of similarly treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A). To
corroborate the MITF dependence of PGC1a and TRPM1
promoter activities in the cells treated with single agents or
combination of the inhibitors, luciferase reporter assays were
performed in MEL624 cells after siRNA knockdown of MITF.

Cells with control siRNA (siRisc) treatment showed a similar
proﬁle of inhibitor-induced changes as was observed in the
non-siRNA–transfected cells in Fig. 4D, whereas cells with
MITF knockdown did not upregulate PGC1a and TRPM1
promoter activities after selumetinib treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C). These activities were downregulated
after AZD8055 and combination treatments to a greater extent
than in the control siRNA–treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8B and S8C).
Inhibition of mTOR1/2 inhibits OCR in melanoma cells
The effects of additional PI3K pathway inhibitors on OCR
were assessed. Class I PI3K (GDC0941, BKM120) and AKT
(MK2206) inhibitors caused partial inhibition of OCR
(Fig. 5A) and PGC1a (Fig. 5B), but less than was observed
with mTORC1/2 inhibition. Treatment with rapamycin,
which inhibits mTORC1 only, partially inhibited OCR in
both cell lines despite comparable (versus AZD8055) inhibition of phospho-S6 (Fig. 5A and B). siRNA-mediated
knockdown of mTOR, or combined knockdown of RAPTOR
(mTORC1 complex) and RICTOR (mTORC2), inhibited OCR
as effectively as knockdown of PGC1a, which was more than
knockdown of RAPTOR or RICTOR alone achieved (Fig. 5C).
Supporting the functional signiﬁcance of PGC1a, siRNAmediated knockdown of PGC1a produced additive or synergistic effects with selumetinib on growth inhibition and
apoptosis induction in both lines (Fig. 5D and E). Knockdown efﬁcacies were conﬁrmed by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S8D).
Mice with subcutaneous xenografts of MEL624 cells were
treated with vehicle, selumetinib, AZD2014 (analog of
AZD8055 with superior in vivo pharmacokinetics; ref. 22; Supplementary Fig. S9), or selumetinib þ AZD2014. After 15 days of
continuous treatment, tumor growth was only slightly inhibited with each single agent but was signiﬁcantly inhibited by
selumetinb þ AZD2014 (Fig. 5F). Western blotting revealed
that the individual treatments and the combination inhibited
direct targets (P-ERK, P-S6) of each inhibitor (Fig. 5F right).
Selumetinib increased PGC1a and MITF levels, and AZD2014
decreased PGC1a, and also decreased MITF, which was unlike
the effects observed in vitro (Fig. 5F).
Increased OxPhos in melanoma cell lines and patient
samples with acquired resistance to MAPK pathway
inhibitors
The selumetinib-sensitive A375 and WM35 cell lines were
cultured in 0.5 mmol/L selumetinib for 60 days and MEKiresistant clones (A375–R1 and –R2; WM35–R1 and –R2)
were isolated (Supplementary Fig. S10A and B). Sequencing
of 202 genes with known cancer mutations demonstrated
that all four resistant clones had mutations in MEK1 that
were not present in the parental cell lines (MEK1F129L
in A375-R1/2, MEK1I99N in WM35-R1/2; Supplementary
Table S4). These mutations were previously associated with
MEKi resistance (23). Seahorse analysis showed that both
A375–R1 and A375–R2 had 3-fold higher basal OCR and 5fold higher maximal OCR than the parental A375 but similar
ECAR (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S10C). The clones

7044

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

demonstrated increased MAPK activity, which was partially
inhibited by selumetinib (Supplementary Fig. S10D). Both
A375–R1 and –R2 showed higher expression of PGC1a
compared with the parental cells and markedly increased
expression following selumetinib treatment (Fig. 6B).
AZD8055 treatment blocked the increase in PGC1a (Fig.
6B), caused synergistic short-term and long-term growth
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S11), and induced apoptosis
in the A375-R1 and A375-R2 (Fig. 6C). Similar to the heterogeneity observed in de novo–resistant cell lines, WM35–
R1 and –R2 clones did not demonstrate increases in OCR
(Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S10C) or PGC1a (Fig. 6B),
nor synergy with selumetinib þ AZD8055 (Supplementary
Fig. S11 and 6C).
PGC1a and MITF transcript levels were assessed in two
independent cohorts of patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma treated with MAPK pathway inhibitors
with biopsies obtained before treatment and at the time of
disease progression (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Among the 18 patients in the MIA/WH cohort treated with
BRAF inhibitors (5 in combination with the MEK inhibitor
trametinib), 9 demonstrated increased tumor PGC1a expression at the time of disease progression compared with
pretreatment (Fig. 6D). Among the 5 MGH patients treated
with BRAF inhibitors (4 dabrafenib þ trametinib) with
evaluable mRNA pretreatment and at progression, one
patient demonstrated >20-fold increase in PGC1a at disease
progression, whereas two others showed an approximately
2-fold increase (Supplementary Fig. S12A). MITF levels in
both cohorts generally but not universally correlated with
PGC1a levels. MAPK was activated in most of the MIA/WH
tumors at progression and on treatment, but did not correlate with PGC1a or MITF expression (Supplementary
Table S1). In the MGH patients, MAPK was activated in 3
of 5 progressed tumors (Supplementary Table S2).

Discussion
There is a critical need to identify new approaches to
overcome resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Activation
of several oncogenic signaling pathways has been implicated
previously in resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma. The
studies presented here add to the growing evidence that
alterations in cellular metabolism may also play a key role.
Speciﬁcally, our approach using whole-genome siRNA screening and mRNA expression proﬁling to broadly interrogate
resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors implicated high
OxPhos as a central resistance mechanism and therapeutic
target. Similar to other recent studies in this ﬁeld (6, 7), we
found that elevated OxPhos correlated strongly with increased
expression of PGC1a. In addition to characterizing a subset of
melanoma cell lines with de novo resistance to MAPK pathway
inhibitors, we have also identiﬁed elevated OxPhos as a characteristic of cell lines and patients with acquired resistance.
Importantly, we have also demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that
melanomas with increased OxPhos are sensitive to combined
treatment with MAPK pathway inhibitors and mTORC1/2
inhibition in vitro and in vivo, and that mTORC1/2 inhibition

affects MITF localization and PGC1a expression. These results
identify a new and unexpected function for mTORC1/2 signaling in melanoma and identify a potentially clinically actionable strategy to overcome resistance mediated by OxPhos.
Two other groups have recently reported that PGC1a expression correlates with, and is regulated by, MITF in melanoma.
Underscoring the clinical signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding, increased
expression of PGC1a correlated with shorter survival in a small
cohort of melanoma patients with regional metastases (6, 7).
One group also demonstrated that inhibition of MAPK pathway signaling in melanomas with activating BRAF mutations
resulted in increased MITF expression, and subsequently
PGC1a, in both cell lines and patients (6). Enforced expression
of PGC1a in melanoma cell lines with activating BRAF mutations reduced their sensitivity to growth inhibition by BRAF
inhibitors (6). We similarly have found that inhibition of either
BRAF or MEK results in an induction of MITF and PGC1a in
roughly half of human melanoma cells lines with de novo
resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Notably, this effect is
heterogeneous among melanoma cell lines, with much higher
levels of MEK inhibitor-induced PGC1a expression occurring
in a subset of BRAF-mutant cell lines with de novo resistance
compared with BRAF-mutant cells lines that undergo apoptosis. This heterogeneity was also observed in subclones of
sensitive BRAF-mutant human melanoma cell lines selected
for acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors that have clinically
relevant MEK1 mutations. We have also shown for the ﬁrst
time that increased PGC1a expression is detected in a significant subset of tumors collected from patients at the time of
disease progression on FDA-approved BRAF and BRAF/MEK
inhibitor therapy. Together, these ﬁndings support that melanomas with elevated OxPhos and PGC1a likely represent a
clinically important subtype of this disease. Analysis of the
PGC1a expression levels in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) collection supports that this phenotype can characterize melanomas with BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, and
tumors that are wild-type for both of those oncogenes (Supplementary Fig. S12B, inset).
These results strongly support the need for therapeutic
strategies for melanomas with elevated OxPhos and PGC1a.
One of the previous studies of MITF and PGC1a showed that
mitochondrial poisons can increase the sensitivity of BRAFmutant cells to BRAF inhibitors in vitro (6). It is likely that such
strategies will be challenging to implement safely clinically.
We previously observed that some cell lines with de novo
resistance to apoptosis induced by MAPK inhibitors were
sensitive to the combination of selumetinib and the dual
mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055 (14, 16). Testing of this combination across an extended panel of cell lines with de novo
resistance in our current study unexpectedly showed that all
tested cell lines with high OxPhos and elevated PGC1a demonstrated synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis, which
was not observed in any resistant cell lines with low OxPhos.
This synergy was observed in high OxPhos melanoma cell
lines with activating BRAF mutations and also in a cell line
with an activating NRAS mutation. The correlation of increased
OxPhos with sensitivity to the combination was also observed
in cell lines selected for acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors.

7046

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

The combination of selumetinib and the dual mTORC1/2
inhibitor AZD2014 was markedly more effective than either
agent alone in mice bearing xenografts of the BRAF-mutant,
high OxPhos MEL624 human melanoma cell line.
Interrogation of the mechanisms underlying the observed
synergy with MEK and TORC1/2 inhibitors showed that inhibition of both complexes of mTOR markedly inhibited PGC1a
expression. While mTORC1/2 inhibition in vitro did not decrease
MITF mRNA expression or promoter activity, Western blotting
revealed that this treatment resulted in cytoplasmic localization
of MITF protein. Nuclear exclusion of MITF by a small molecule
is a novel ﬁnding. While the MITF antibody used in this study
detected the M (melanocytic) isoform of MITF, up to 10 MITF
isoforms are known to exist, and future studies will determine
whether others are similarly regulated. Interestingly, long-term
in vivo treatment of the MEL624 tumors with mTORC1/2
inhibitor resulted in complete loss of MITF by an unknown
mechanism. Determining the mechanism and timing of these
observed differential effects on MITF is an important future
endeavor, as is interrogation of MITF subcellular localization in
melanoma biology, progression, and therapy. While our ﬁnding
of OxPhos regulation by mTORC is consistent with a previous
study by Cunningham and colleagues (24), which implicated the
Raptor–mTOR complex (mTORC1) in the activation of mitochondrial function via the transcription factor YY1, our experiments with siRNAs (siRaptor, siRictor) and inhibitors (rapamycin, AZD8055) demonstrate that inhibition of both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 activity decreases OxPhos more than inhibition of
TORC1 alone.
In summary, our results demonstrate that both de novo and
acquired resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors in melanomas with high OxPhos can be counteracted by mTORC1/2
inhibition. Notably, the metabolic characterization of cell lines
and patient samples demonstrates that high OxPhos is not a
universal characteristic of MAPK pathway inhibitor resistance,
and mTORC1/2 inhibition did not synergize with MEKi in
MEKi-resistant cell lines with low OxPhos. Together, these
ﬁndings support the rationale for clinical characterization of
candidate biomarkers of elevated OxPhos in melanoma and
other cancers to guide therapeutic selection, and evaluation of
combined inhibition of mTOR1/2 and MAPK signaling in this
metabolically deﬁned cancer subtype.
