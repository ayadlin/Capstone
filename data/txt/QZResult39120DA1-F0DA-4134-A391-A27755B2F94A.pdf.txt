Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies with Immunotoxins
and Antibody-Drug Conjugates
David J. FitzGerald1, Alan S. Wayne2, Robert J. Kreitman1, and Ira Pastan1

Abstract
To enable antibodies to function as cytotoxic anticancer agents, they are modified either via attachment to
protein toxins or highly potent, low-molecular-weight drugs. Such molecules, termed immunotoxins and
antibody-drug conjugates, respectively, represent a second revolution in antibody-mediated cancer therapy.
Thus, highly toxic compounds are delivered to the interior of cancer cells based on antibody specificity for cellsurface target antigens. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6300–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
We are approaching the end of the first phase of the
antibody revolution. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
are approved for the treatment of hematologic malignancies,
providing effective clinical options for the management of
these malignancies and extending the life of many patients (1).
New mAbs and constructs designed to improve potency may
eventually be shown to be clinically effective in some leukemias and lymphomas. However, current evidence suggests
that unconjugated mAbs have limited utility in many subtypes
of hematologic malignancies. Thus, in the next phase of this
revolution, mAbs will be used to deliver cytotoxic substances to
cells. On the basis of their chemical properties, cytotoxic agents
can be divided into different categories: low-molecular-weight
agents, high-molecular-weight protein toxins, and radioisotopes. Also, the variable fragments (Fv) of antibodies are used
to direct immune effector cells, such as cytotoxic T cells, to
antigens on cancer cells via chimeric antigen receptors (2) and
to create bispecific T-cell–engaging antibodies (3).
In this review, we focus on mAbs or fragments of mAbs that
are attached to cytotoxic agents produced by bacteria or
plants, including high-molecular-weight protein toxins and
low-molecular-weight chemical entities, such as calicheamicin, mytansinoids, and auristatin. (Radioimmunotherapy is
discussed elsewhere; refs. 4, 5.) Initial efforts using antibodies
to deliver cytotoxic compounds to cancer cells were not
successful for several reasons, including lack of specificity

of the antibody, low activity of the cytotoxic conjugate, and
side effects due to the toxic moiety. Over the past several years,
many of these problems have been recognized and overcome.
This review covers advances that have been reported over the
past 5 years, showing that immunotoxins and antibody-drug
conjugates (ADC) have efficacy and will likely play an increasingly important role in cancer treatment.

General Features of Immunotoxins and
Antibody-Drug Conjugates
Immunotoxins and ADCs are assembled in a number of
different ways. Antibody fragments or whole antibodies are
combined with either protein toxins or low-molecular-weight
toxic drugs. Linkage options include gene fusions (peptide
bonds), disulfide bonds, and thioether bonds. Design goals
dictate that immunotoxins and ADCs remain intact while in
systemic circulation but disassemble inside the target cell,
releasing the toxic "payload." Uncoupling the toxin or drug
from the antibody is accomplished by protease degradation,
disulfide bond reduction, or hydrolysis of an acid-labile bond.
Toxin or drug attachment to the antibody must not interfere
with antigen binding.

Antibodies
As with all cancer therapeutics, the goal of antibody-mediated killing is to eliminate the malignant cells. The choice of
antibody will depend on the disease target. Generally, differentiation antigens or receptors that are expressed on malignant cells are appropriate targets, provided they are not
expressed on normal vital tissues. Antigens and receptors
should be internalized after antibody binding; this ensures
that the toxin or drug is transported to the cell interior, where
it separates from the antibody and kills the cell.

Protein toxins are chosen for their potency as enzymes, with
the rationale being that only a small number of molecules

Immunotoxins and Antibody-Drug Conjugates

need to be delivered to the site of action, usually the cell
cytosol. Once delivered, the turnover rate of the enzyme will
allow many substrate molecules to be modified per toxin
molecule. Likewise, nonenzymatic toxic products are also
selected because of their potency. Protein toxins have several
positive attributes: They can be attached directly to antibodies
via peptide bonds (see below), and they can be modified easily
with engineered modifications of toxin genes. The latter is
particularly useful in the design of improved versions. However, because toxins are "foreign" proteins and can induce
antibody formation, immunogenicity is a drawback, although
solutions to this problem by removing B- or T-cell epitopes
may occur in the near future (6, 7). Nonprotein cytotoxics are
attached chemically to antibodies via "mild" reactions, such as
disulfide exchange or lysine modification (8). Examples of
clinically relevant antibody-linked cytotoxics that have undergone or are currently undergoing study in humans are
provided in Table 1.
The majority of the protein toxins in clinical development
are different types of enzymatic inhibitors of protein synthesis. Diphtheria toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas exotoxin A
(PE) catalyze the ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2
(EF2), halting the elongation of growing peptide chains.
Plant toxins inactivate ribosomes via glycosidase activity.
Specifically, ricin hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the
adenine residue at position 4324. Ricin-like toxins exhibit
similar activities. Low-molecular-weight chemical cytotoxics
include auristatin and maytansine, which target tubulin and
calicheamicin and cause double-strand breaks in DNA.
Enzymatic turnover rates indicate that only a few molecules
of a protein toxin need be delivered to the cytosol to
inactivate protein synthesis. In addition, although no direct
comparisons have been made, biochemical principles dictate that greater numbers of nonenzymatic cytotoxics need
to be delivered to their targets to be equally effective as the
enzymatic toxins.

Attachment of Toxins to Antibodies
By using genetic engineering, truncated DT and PE genes are
fused with cDNAs encoding antibody Fvs or antibody-binding
fragments (Fab) to make recombinant immunotoxins (9). To
accomplish this, the native binding domain of the toxin is
replaced with the antibody gene sequence. To preserve essential toxin functions, the Fv or Fab is inserted in the same
location as the toxin-binding domain (e.g., at the N-terminus of
PE and C-terminus of DT). The preferred construct of DT
includes 388 amino acids followed by a cell-binding moiety. For
PE-based immunotoxins, the Fv is followed by a 38-kDa toxin
fragment that includes a putative translocation domain, followed by its ADP-ribosylating domain. For PE but not DT, a
C-terminal sequence that binds the KDEL receptor is needed
for cytotoxic action. For antibody-drug conjugates, attachment
is via chemical linkage. Auristatin is coupled to antibody cysteines via a thioether bond. Cytotoxic auristatin is
further modified to include a dipeptide that is susceptible to
lysosomal protease. Linkage of maytansine is achieved via
coupling to lysine residues using either disulfide or thioether

www.aacrjournals.org

linkages (10). Calicheamicin can be attached to either carbohydrate or lysine residues. However, lysine modification is
preferred, to avoid possible antibody damage via periodate
oxidation.

How Toxins and Drugs Enter Cells and Are
Released
The intracellular fate of immunotoxins and ADCs is a 2-part
story: The first part takes place while the cytotoxic is still
attached to the antibody, and the second, after release. The
antibody must internalize the cytotoxic to a release site, and
the released compound must complete the journey to the
cytosol. Endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum play critical roles in the fate of these molecules. Cytotoxics
are generally more active when targeted to antigens that are
efficiently internalized. However, protein toxins must stay
intact and avoid lysosomal degradation, whereas drug cytotoxics must be released from antibodies and may benefit
from the action of lysosomal proteases. DT translocates to
the cytosol from acidic endosomes, whereas PE requires a
KDEL-like sequence to traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum,
from which it can then enter the cytosol (Fig. 1).
Cytotoxics are released from antibodies in several ways: by
proteases, by disulfide bond reduction, or by exposure to an
acidic environment. Protein toxins joined to antibodies via
peptide bonds or drugs like auristatin linked through dipeptides require proteolytic cleavage. Toxins or drugs attached
chemically by disulfide bonds require reduction. Some acidlabile linkers favor release of the cytotoxic in endosomes or
lysosomes.
In living cells, delivery to the appropriate intracellular
location for release of the cytotoxic seems to be a key factor
in determining the effectiveness of the ADC or immunotoxin.
Polson and colleagues found that cleavable cross-linkers
mediate toxicity when targeted to any one of several antigens
on non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), but noncleavable linkers
were effective only when targeted to CD22 and CD79b, suggesting that those 2 antigens internalized efficiently (10).
This result emphasizes the point that even when cells have
the factors needed for toxin release, poor delivery to a specific
location will result in little or no killing. Similarly, immunotoxins directed to CD22 are more potent than those directed
to CD19, despite the fact that the number of cell-associated
immunotoxin molecules is greater for CD19 (see below
and ref. 11).
Release of auristatin is claimed to require the action of
lysosomal proteases (12). A feature of this release relates to the
hydrophobic nature of the drug and the fact that the authors
present evidence for bystander effects when the drug is
released in close proximity to antigen-negative cells (see
below).
Release of DT- and PE-related proteins depends on a furinlike cleavage followed by the reduction of a key disulfide bond.
Although the intracellular locations for cleavage and reduction have not been established, there is some evidence that
release of protein toxins is antigen specific. Immunotoxins
directed to CD22 were potently active, whereas similar immu-

FitzGerald et al.

notoxins to CD19 were less potent, despite the fact that both
were internalized. This differential effect could be due to
different rates of internalization (11).

Bystander Effects
Protein toxins released from dead or dying cells are not
thought to be active against bystander cells, but this may not
be true of all cytotoxics. Auristatins are hydrophobic compounds that are membrane permeable and, once released
from their antibody carriers, are free to diffuse to neighboring
cells, regardless of whether they display the target antigen.
Okeley and colleagues propose that this diffusion could enhance clinical outcomes if lesions consist of mixtures of cells
with variable target antigen expression (12). Released drug
from strongly antigen-positive cells could kill dimly expressing
low-uptake cells. Although this cell killing has been noted in
model tissue culture systems, it is not clear if this is operational against tumors in animals.

Immunogenicity and Antidrug Antibodies
Typically, protein toxins are foreign proteins and induce
antibody formation when injected into patients with intact
immune systems. Over 90% of individuals with epithelial cell
cancers treated with protein immunotoxins make antitoxin
antibodies after 1 or 2 cycles of treatment. However, when
immunotoxins are given to patients with hematologic cancers,
the incidence of antitoxin or antidrug antibodies is low, and
even if they develop, it is commonly after several cycles of
therapy. Protein toxins are likely to contain many epitopes,
whereas low-molecular-weight cytotoxics will have few or no
epitopes. The recent study with the auristatin conjugate SGN35 revealed that only 2 of 40 patients made antidrug antibodies (13). Notably, subjects on that trial were likely immunosuppressed by the nature of their disease [93% Hodgkin
lymphoma (HL)] and prior therapy [median, 3 prior regimens
and 73% post–autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)]. For
protein toxins to be useful in multicycle protocols in patients
with normal immune systems, immunogenicity needs to be
reduced or suppressed. This reduction can be accomplished in
several ways: mutagenesis to remove immunodominant B- (7)
or T-cell epitopes or the coadministration of immunosuppressive drugs. At the current time, immunotoxins are given
predominantly to patients who have been heavily pretreated
with bone marrow–damaging and immune-depleting therapies, so antibody formation is suppressed. However, as immunotoxin and ADC treatment regimens become more
successful, immunogenicity may emerge as an issue that will
need to be addressed.

Immunotoxins in Clinical Trials
Targeting the interleukin-2 receptor
Denileukin diftitox (DD) is a fusion protein composed of
interleukin (IL)–2 fused to the first 388 amino acids of DT.
Although it has IL-2 instead of an Fv, it targets and kills cells in
the same manner as does an immunotoxin, and is thus

6302

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

described here in this context. DD, like IL-2, binds tightly
to the IL-2 receptor 3-chain complex (alpha, beta, gamma), but
it binds much less tightly (Kd 108 versus 1011) to the alpha
subunit, which commonly greatly outnumbers other subunits
on B- and T-cell malignancies. DD is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in adults (14). In
early studies in which DD alone was given to CTCL patients,
the objective response rate (ORR) was 38% to 49%. Efficacy
was enhanced to an ORR of 67% in patients who also received
the retinoid bexarotene, which raises IL-2 receptor levels (15).
DD also has activity in other hematologic malignancies. In 27
patients with refractory T-cell NHL, it had an ORR of 48%, with
22% complete responses (CR; ref. 16). In patients with B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the levels of IL2 receptor are low, it produced partial responses (PR) in only 2
of 18 (11%) patients (17). Several trials were carried out in IL-2receptor–expressing B-cell NHL. When DD was given alone,
it had low activity, but activity was increased when it was
combined with rituximab, with an ORR of 32% with 16% CRs
(18).
LMB2 [anti-Tac(Fv)–PE38] is a fusion protein in which the
Fv portion of an antibody to CD25, the alpha chain of the IL-2
receptor, is fused to a 38-kDa truncated PE (PE38). LMB2 was
originally evaluated in a phase I trial in which a maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) of 50 mcg/kg given every other day  3
doses per cycle was established, and an ORR of 23%, including
4 of 4 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), was seen (19).
LMB2 is now being evaluated in the treatment of adult T-cell
leukemia and/or lymphoma (ATLL), in combination with
cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to try to decrease antibody
formation and reduce tumor bulk.
Targeting CD22
CD22 is a lineage-restricted differentiation antigen
expressed on B cells and most B-cell malignancies. Because
it is rapidly internalized following immunotoxin or antibody
binding, it is an attractive target for immunotoxins and ADCs
(11).
RFB4–deglycosylated ricin–A chain (dgA) is an immunotoxin composed of a dgA chemically attached to the RFB4
anti-CD22 antibody that was developed by Messmann and
colleagues (20). This agent has activity in animal models and
has been tested in adults alone and in combination with an
anti-CD19 immunotoxin (21). Capillary leak syndrome (CLS)
was a major side effect observed in phase I trials.
Our laboratory produced a recombinant immunotoxin targeting CD22, in which the Fv of the anti-CD22 antibody RFB4
was fused to PE38 (22). It was named BL22 and later CAT-3888.
Following studies in which it showed excellent cell-killing
activity against patient cells (23) and against tumor xenografts
(24), phase I and II trials were carried out at the National
Cancer Institute (NCI). The agent was given intravenously
every other day  3 to adults and every other day  3 (or  6)
to children, with cycles repeated every 21 to 28 days. In the
phase I trial of 46 adults, 31 patients with drug-resistant HCL
showed an ORR of 81% with 61% CRs (25). The dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) was a completely reversible hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS). In a phase II study in HCL, the high response

rate was confirmed with an ORR of 72% and 47% CRs (26).
Because BL22 had low activity in other B-cell malignancies in
which the number of CD22 molecules on the cell surface was
much fewer (CLL) or in which the cells grew very rapidly
(acute lymphoblastic leukemia; ALL; ref. 27), we stopped
developing BL22 and are now developing a new agent with
higher affinity and activity (described below).
HA22 (moxetumomab pasudotox) is an improved form of
BL22 in which 3 amino acids in CDR3 of the heavy chain of the
Fv are mutated from SSY to THW (28). This mutation results
in a 14-fold increase in affinity and a significant increase in
cell-killing activity. A phase I trial in HCL has been completed,
with additional patients currently being treated at the MTD
(29). In addition, phase I trials in adults with CLL and NHL and
in children with ALL are ongoing. MedImmune, LLC, has
assumed the clinical development of moxetumomab pasudotox.
Clinical trial results of HA22 (moxetumomab
pasudotox)
Hairy cell leukemia. A total of 32 adults with HCL
refractory to therapy or relapsed after at least 2 prior courses
of purine analogues received moxetumomab pasudotox (29).
It was administered as 30-minute i.v. infusion every other day
 3, with cycles repeated every 4 weeks at doses between 5 and
50 mcg/kg. DLT was not achieved, and dose escalation was
stopped because responses were observed at all dose levels
and did not seem to correlate with dose escalation. Major
responses were seen at all dose levels, including CRs at all dose
levels beginning at 10 mcg/kg  3, and the overall CR rate
was 31%. Neutralizing antibodies eventually developed in
14 (44%) of subjects. A phase II study of HA22 for HCL is
in development.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CD22 is expressed in
almost all cases of ALL in children, making it an excellent
target for antibody-based therapies (27). BL22 was tested in a
phase I trial in children with ALL and NHL. Although there
were no objective responses on that trial, transient clinical
activity was seen in 16 of 23 (70%) subjects (27). This trial was
stopped because of the availability of moxetumomab pasudotox, which was much more active in preclinical models. A
pediatric phase I trial for CD22þ ALL and NHL is in progress,
and interim analyses reported clinical activity in 8 of 12
patients (67%) including 3 (25%) CRs (30, 31). Because 2 of
7 patients treated at 30 mcg/kg experienced grades 3 and
4 CLS, the trial was amended to include prophylactic corticosteroids during the first cycle of therapy. Notably, in comparison with adult trials, a more intensive dosing schedule has
been developed for children with ALL (every other day  6
every 21 days). Phase II trials of HA22 for pediatric ALL are
planned. Note that preclinical studies indicate that moxetumomab pasudotox is synergistic with standard chemotherapy
against childhood ALL blasts (32).
Targeting CD19
CD19, like CD22, is expressed in most B-cell malignancies
and is internalized sufficiently well to bring cytotoxic compounds into the cell. A number of immunotoxins that target

Figure 1. Pathways of binding,
internalization, and processing by
immunotoxins and ADCs leading
to the killing of target cells. 1, a
PE-derived immunotoxin binds
CD22, is internalized via clathrincoated pits, is processed within
the cell, and traffics through the
endoplasmic reticulum to the
cytosol, where an enzymatically
active fragment ADP ribosylates
EF2, which inhibits protein
synthesis and leads to cell death.
2, A DT-based toxin, targeted to
the IL-2 receptor, is internalized to
endosomes where the A chain of
the toxin is released to the cytosol:
it also ADP ribosylates EF2,
inhibiting protein synthesis and
leading to cell death. 3, ADCs bind
target receptors, are internalized,
and traffic to lysosomes. In the
lysosome, drugs are cleaved from
the carrier antibody and then
released to the cytosol to target
tubulin (for auristatin and
maytansine) or DNA (for
calicheamicin). The pathway
for ricin-based immunotoxins
(not shown) resembles that of PE,
except its cytosolic target is
ribosomal RNA. Ricin-mediated
depurination of rRNA results in
inhibition of protein synthesis.

CD19 are being developed for human testing. Results have
recently been reported of a trial of the dgA immunotoxin
HD37-dgA in combination with an anti-CD22 immunotoxin
(see below).
Targeting CD19 and CD22
The combination of HD37-dgA and RFB4-dgA (Combotox)
has been studied in adults and children with B-lineage hematologic malignancies. In a recently reported trial in children with
ALL, 17 patients were treated, and a MTD of 5 mg/m2 established. Three (18%) CRs were observed, and hematologic
activity was noted in other patients. Incidence of severe
adverse events was high; 2 of 11 patients (18%) developed
antidrug antibodies (33). An alternative approach to target
these 2 antigens has been to make a bivalent recombinant
immunotoxin (DT2219), in which 1 Fv binds to CD19 and the
other to CD22. DT2219 has shown excellent activity in preclinical models and is now in phase I testing (34).

Targeting CD3
CD3 is widely expressed in T-cell malignancies. An anti-CD3
recombinant immunotoxin AdmDT390-bisFv (UCHT1) is constructed of a divalent molecule consisting of 2 single-chain
antibody fragments reactive with the extracellular domain of
CD3e, fused to the catalytic and translocation domains of DT
(35). This agent is now in clinical trials for adults with T-cell
malignancies. An interim report of an ongoing phase I trial
noted 2 PRs in 5 evaluable adults with CTCL (35).
Immunotoxin improvements
Although immunotoxins have shown efficacy in several
types of hematologic malignancies, a few undesirable properties have been identified in clinical trials. In some
patients, neutralizing antibodies develop after several cycles
of treatment. In the case of immunotoxins made from PE,
we have been able to identify and remove the B-cell epitopes
recognized by the mouse immune system, resulting in an

FitzGerald et al.

active immunotoxin that can be given repeatedly to mice
without inducing antibody formation (7). However, this
immunotoxin also has many human epitopes removed
and needs further study to determine whether it will be
less immunogenic in humans.
A second problem identified in clinical trials is the development of CLS. In the case of ricin-based immunotoxins, this
side effect has been attributed to carbohydrate residues on the
toxin binding to endothelial cells. It has been diminished but
not eliminated by using forms of ricin that do not contain
carbohydrate modifications. In the case of PE-based immunotoxins, CLS has only rarely been dose limiting, but is
nonetheless a significant side effect. Weldon and colleagues
have reported on an immunotoxin that has a deletion of a
large portion of domain II of PE that is fully cytotoxic, yet its
nonspecific toxicities in mice, which may reflect the ability of
these immunotoxins to cause CLS in patients, are greatly
diminished (36).
A third problem concerns the half-life in the circulation of
immunotoxins. DD has a short half-life with an alpha of 70 to
80 minutes. BL22, moxetumomab, and LMB2 have longer halflives in the range of 2 to 3 hours in adults and 0.5 to 4 hours in
children. Recombinant immunotoxins were originally
designed to be small, with the goal of enhancing penetration
into solid tumor masses (37). Although small size may be
useful, it also causes these agents to be rapidly removed from
the circulation. It is possible to make recombinant immunotoxins of larger sizes by fusing the toxin to Fabs or even entire
antibody molecules and producing these in Escherichia coli
(38, 39).

Antibody-Drug Conjugates
Targeting CD22
Inotuzumab ozogamicin (CMC-544) is a humanized antiCD22 mAb attached to calicheamicin. Results of a phase I trial
in adults were recently reported (40), and a MTD of 1.8 mg/m2
every 4 weeks was established. ORRs of 68% and 15% were
observed in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), respectively, treated at the
MTD. A phase II trial was carried out in 43 patients (41). The
ORR was 53%, including 66% for FL and 19% for DLBCL. In a
recent trial, CMC-544 was administered with rituximab prior
to high-dose therapy and ASCT. The ORR in 19 patients with
DLBCL was 21%, with 2 CRs and 2 PRs (42). In a large study
reported preliminarily in 2009, 119 patients with relapsed FL
and DLBCL were enrolled in a combination study in which
rituximab was administered 1 day prior to CMC-544. The ORR
was 87% in FL and 80% in DLBCL. Of these patients, 25 were
previously refractory to rituximab, and the ORR was only 20%
for this subgroup (43).
Targeting CD30
CD30 is expressed on several types of hematologic tumors,
particularly HL and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).
The anti-CD30 mAb cAC10 was conjugated to monomethyl
auristatin E (MMAE) through a valine-citrulline peptide
linker to make SGN-35 or brentuximab vedotin. Brentux-

imab vedotin kills cells by depolymerizing tubulin, causing
phase growth arrest at G2 and M and apoptotic cell death.
Modifications in the linker chemistry improved the therapeutic index in preclinical models using a monomethyl
auristatin F (MMAF) derivative (44). A phase I trial of
SGN-35 enrolled 45 patients with HL (n ¼ 42), ALCL (n ¼
2), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 1; ref. 13).
The MTD is 1.8 mg/kg administered as a single i.v. infusion
every 3 weeks. Of 45 patients, 17 (38%) responded, with 11
(24%) CRs (13). The dose response was clear, with 10 out of
25 (45%) patients achieving CR at 1.8 mg/kg versus only 1
out of 20 (5%) patients achieving CR at lower dose levels.
ORR at the MTD (n ¼ 12) was 50%, including 4 (33%) CRs
and 2 (17%) PRs. Of 42 evaluable patients, 36 (86%) had
tumor regression, and 13 (81%) patients with tumor-related
symptoms at baseline became symptom free. Median response duration was 17.3 months, and median progressionfree survival was 5.9 months.
Additional clinical reports of SGN-35 were presented in late
2010 at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Hematology. In a trial of 58 patients with ALCL, 30 evaluable
patients with a median of 2 prior therapies were reported to
have an ORR of 87% with 57% CRs (45). A pivotal phase II trial
of SGN-35 in HL was reported to have enrolled 102 patients, all
with prior ASCT and a median of 4 prior therapies (46). A
median of 9 cycles of SGN-35 was administered at 1.8 mg/kg
every 3 weeks. Tumor regression was reported in 95%, and B
symptoms were resolved in 83% of the 35 patients with
baseline B symptoms (46).
Targeting CD33
CD33 is expressed on the surface of early multilineage
hematopoietic progenitors, myelomonocytic precursors,
cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, some lymphoid
cells, 80% to 90% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
and some cases of B-cell precursor and T-cell ALL. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized IgG4 anti-CD33 antibody
linked to calicheamicin (47). On the basis of the results of 3
phase II trials in 142 adults with relapsed AML, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted marketing
approval of gemtuzumab ozogamicin under the accelerated
approval regulations in 2000. The CR rate with full blood
count recovery was 16%. When patients with CR and
incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) were included, the overall response rate was 30%. In patients over 60 years of age,
the overall response rate was 26% (48). Similar response
rates were also seen in a phase I trial in pediatric patients
with AML, in which CR was achieved in 8 of 29 (28%)
patients, 4 of these with incomplete platelet count recovery
(49). However, on the basis of the lack of shown benefit in
randomized phase III studies (50), gemtuzumab ozogamicin
was voluntarily withdrawn by its manufacturer in 2010 at
the request of the FDA. A randomized phase III trial
designed to assess the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin
in combination with standard chemotherapy in newly diagnosed pediatric patients with AML is being conducted by
the Children's Oncology Group (COG; AAML0531; ref. 51).
However, accrual to this trial was discontinued in 2010,

Immunotoxins and Antibody-Drug Conjugates

and gemtuzumab ozogamicin is no longer available for
patients who remain on the study. Final analysis of patients
who completed randomized therapy awaits longer followup.
Additional anti-CD33 conjugates undergoing study include
AVE9633, an ADC composed of the humanized mAb huMy9-6
and maytansinoid DM4 (52). Additionally, immunotoxins
composed of deglycosylated gelonin linked to lintuzumab
(HuM195; ref. 53) and one constructed using truncated PE
linked to a single-chain Fv directed to CD33 (54) have been
described.
Targeting CD123
Myeloid leukemic progenitors express the IL-3 receptor
(CD123), and after binding IL-3, the complex undergoes
receptor-mediated endocytosis. Frankel and colleagues developed an immunotoxin composed of the catalytic and
translocation domains of DT (DT388) linked to human IL3 (55). An MTD of 12.5 mcg/kg was shown in a phase I trial in
adults with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Responses were observed in 3 of 39 (8%) patients with
AML (1 CR, 2 PRs) and 1 of 3 with MDS (1 PR). A total of
90% of patients had baseline antidrug antibodies likely
related to prior diphtheria vaccine, and 23 of 30 (77%)
evaluable patients developed increased antibody titers after
treatment (56).
Targeting CD56
CD56 is a neural cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by
natural killer (NK) cells, a subset of T cells, and by a variety of
malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM) and certain
solid tumors. IMGN901 (huN901-DM1) is an ADC composed of
the maytansine DM1 conjugated to the anti-CD56 antibody
huN901. An MTD of 112 mg/m2 was shown in a phase I trial in
adults with MM treated with this agent, and 2 of 28 (7%) PRs
were observed (57, 58).

Targeting CD138
BT062 is an antibody-maytansinoid (DM4) conjugate that
targets CD138 (or Syndecan1), a proteoglycan expressed on
the surface of plasma cells; a number of other normal tissues;
and the majority of cases of MM. Clinical activity was observed
in a phase I trial in adults with MM treated with this agent
(58).

What Do We Expect in the Next 5 Years?
After many years of preclinical development, the number of
clinical trials using antibodies or antibody fragments to target
potent cytotoxic molecules to cancer cells has recently increased. Several of these trials have shown impressive clinical
responses, indicating that we are at the beginning of a new and
exciting phase of cancer treatment. Additional studies are now
required to define the optimal dose, schedule, and combinations for specific malignancies. Also, several problems have
been identified. One is immunogenicity, which may be solved
by removing B- and T-cell epitopes. Another problem is likely
to be drug and toxin resistance. Nevertheless, we expect this
new approach will probably have a major impact in cancer
treatment.
