Abstract
Nanotechnology has the potential to make smart drugs that would be capable of targeting cancer but not
normal cells and to load combinations of cooperating agents into a single nanosized particle to more effectively
treat this disease. However, to realize the full potential of this technology, the negative aspects associated
with these nanoparticles need to be overcome. This review discusses concerns in the ﬁeld limiting realization
of the full clinical potential of this technology, which are toxicity and targeted delivery. Strategies to overcome
these hurdles are also reviewed, which could lead to attainment of the full clinical potential of this exciting
technology. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5663–8. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United
States. In 2012, more than 577,190 Americans are expected to
die from cancer. Despite the advances and progress made in
understanding cancer biology and designing new drugs to ﬁght
this complex disease, these efforts are generally not effectively
translated into the clinic. Traditional cancer treatments such
as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are frequently limited.
Limitations in cancer therapies and failure of either U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved or newly developed
anticancer agent occurs, in part, because of undesirable drugassociated side effects, low drug concentrations at the tumor
site, and/or development of resistance (1, 2).
Novel targeted therapeutic approaches with improved efﬁcacy having negligible toxicity are needed to more effectively
translate basic science drug discoveries into clinical applications. Use of nanotechnology is one approach, which offers
possible solutions to these impediments. Nanoparticle-based
drugs have unique properties such as small size (1–100 nm),
large surface-to-volume ratios (3), self-assembly, stability,
speciﬁcity, drug encapsulation, and biocompatibility (4), which
could be used to address many of the issues limiting the use of
traditional drugs. Examples of cancer-related nanotechnologies include drug-delivery carriers such as nanoliposomes that
are gaining in popularity for cancer therapy, nanosized-imaging agents such a C-dots, and theragnostics that could be used
for both diagnostic purposes and for treating cancer.

Resistance is a major obstacle faced by traditional cancer
drugs that might be overcome by using nanotechnology-based
agents. Resistance to initially effective agents can occur
because of overexpression of drug efﬂux pumps, increased
drug metabolism, enhanced self-repairing ability, altered drug
targets, or through bypassing the targeted proteins in a
particular signaling pathway (5). Nanotechnology could be
used to resolve some of these issues by developing agents
that simultaneously target multiple processes or signaling
pathways to more effectively prevent resistance. A recent
example is vemurafenib, which is an agent targeting V600EBRaf in melanomas. In patients harboring V600EB-Raf protein,
tumor regression occurs in up to 80% of patients during the
ﬁrst 2-month treatment cycle using vemurafenib. However,
the majority of patients initially responsive to the drug
eventually developed drug-resistant tumors, mediated by
alternate pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinase
reactivation, or activation of compensating alternative survival pathways. Creating a single multidrug nanoparticle to
target cancer cells and enabling drug accumulation in tumor
cells could decrease resistance development (6, 7). A single
nanoparticle with hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones for
loading different types of drugs could be created and conjugated to cancer cell targeting moieties. A nanoparticle of
this type could be loaded with traditional hydrophobic drugs
such as vemurafenib and perhaps charged particles such as
siRNAs to create optimal drugs combinations to prevent
resistance development (8). Thus, nanoparticles might be
the drugs of the future for overcoming the limitations
encountered by traditional anticancer agents.
Although nanotechnology offers great promise for cancer
treatment, the same properties that make nanoparticles
unique can also limit efﬁcacy. This review examines some
concerns with regard to nanotechnology and discusses
approaches to overcome these issues. Thus, this review is
broadly divided into 2 parts, ﬁrst discussing and detailing
approaches to mitigate toxicity, and, second, reviewing need
for targeted delivery into cancer cells, which are represented in
the idealized nanoparticles shown in Fig. 1.

limitations and potential methods to improve nanoparticle-based targeted drug delivery approaches. The proposed nanoparticle system would exhibit
minimum toxicity and maximum cancer therapeutic efﬁcacy, which will improve the clinical potential of cancer nanotechnology.

Modulating toxicity to realize the full clinical potential of
nanotechnology-based therapeutics
Nanotechnology has signiﬁcant potential for delivering
diverse cancer therapeutics into tumors in a fast, accurate,
and cost-effective manner (9). However, potential toxicity
associated with the nanoparticle itself can be a limitation.

Toxicity mediated by the nanoparticle should be considered
when selecting a particular type to carry out a required
function and strategies designed to overcome this issue. Toxicity of nanoparticles can occur because of size, shape, charge,
compositions, constituent leaching, and triggering of immune
reactions.

Limitations and Approaches of Cancer Nanotechnology

Nanoparticles size and shape can cause toxicity because
the body is designed to recognize and entrap foreign particles
(10). Reports have shown that particles smaller than 80 nm are
nontoxic; however, smaller particles (<10 nm) can cause
signiﬁcant toxicity, leading to malfunction of the body's
biochemical processes and even crossing biologic barriers
(11, 12). Too large or too small nanoparticles can get entrapped
in the reticultoendothelial portion of the immune system or
other interstitial spaces in the body for prolonged periods of
time (13). Decreasing particle size can also lead to an exponential increase in surface area to volume ratio, which can
make the nanomaterial surface more reactive and prone to
aggregation, either by self-reacting or by interacting with
components in the biologic environment. This could then lead
to irreversible deposition in tissues, interfering with critical
biochemical or enzymatic functions. For example, intravenous
injection of nanoparticles transports the agents into vital
organs such as lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys in addition to
tumors. Particles smaller than 100 nm can be rapidly cleared,
but nanoparticles larger than 100 nm tend to accumulate in
the spleen (14), with a speciﬁc example showing that 40% to
50% of 400 nm nanoparticles were retained in this organ.
Because the pore size of liver fenestrae is approximately
100 nm, particles smaller than this size tend to accumulate
in the liver. Nanoparticles of 5.5 nm or smaller size, such as
quantum dots, are rapidly excreted through renal pores,
whereas larger particles tend to be retained in the circulation.
Nanoparticle accumulation in tumors can also be regulated by
particle size. It has been shown that 100 to 200 nm sized
particles found accumulated 4-fold more effectively than those
of 300 nm or smaller than 50 nm (15). Therefore, we suggest
that the ideal nanoparticle should have a dimension of approximately 100 nm, which would be small enough not to cause
toxicity because of deposition in tissues or organs but big
enough to enter into the tumor cells to deliver the anticancer
agents. To further minimize toxicity, reports have shown that
coating nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan, or other biomolecules can improve biocompatibility (16).
Surface coating would minimize interaction of nanocarriers
with external biologic ﬂuids of body; thus size would be of
lesser concern.
Shapes of nanoparticles play an essential role in cellular
uptake and can thus modulate toxicity. Spherical gold nanoparticles are better taken into cells than rod shaped ones (17).
Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to length and cells have
been found to better endocytose lower aspect (1:3) ratio gold
nanorods, than those with a higher (1:5) aspect ratio (17).
Although gold nanorods are poorly taken-up by cells, they tend
to be more toxic than spherical particles, suggesting that
toxicity can be shape dependent. Shape-mediated toxicity can
be modulated by addition of a capping agent. For example, a
positive charge on nanoliposomes or CTAB-coated gold nanorods can lead to toxicity in animals (18), which can be decreased
by replacing the capping with polyelectrolytes (19).
Leaching of the constituents of nanoparticles is another
cause of toxicity. Nanocarriers, composed of metals or semiconductors can be oxidized to corresponding ions when
exposed to body ﬂuids (20). Gold nanorods or nanocages can

www.aacrjournals.org

be used as cancer therapeutics because of infrared light–
absorbing property, which leads to generation of heat and
cancer cell killing by photothermal ablation therapy (21, 22).
Although gold is a biocompatible material, oxidized ions can
lead to complex formation with biologic components, hindering key enzymatic function or induction of toxicity because of
free radical production (23). Chemical composition and surface chemistry of nanomaterials used for drug delivery applications will largely dictate the type of chemical interaction that
might occur between the nanomaterials surface and body's
cells, tissues, or organs (24). In our opinion, surface functionalization should be used to reduce the toxicity of metal-based
nanomaterials by forming a thick surface coating to reduce
oxidation into ions (25).
Similarly, oxides and quantum dots are made of heavy
metals that could release ions causing toxicity. Iron oxides
can be used for drug delivery and imaging but may oxidize to
Fe2þ ions, which can lead to production of hydroxyl radicals by
Fenton Chemistry (26). Quantum dots are 1 to 10 nm small
nanoparticles that have unique optical and electronic properties, with size-tunable light emission and better photostability
than conventional dyes for cancer imaging (27). However,
quantum dots contain heavy metals such as cadmium, and
concerns about possible leaching limits use in humans.
Quantum dots with different emission spectra can be used
to simultaneously track multiple tumor markers (28). Use of
cadmium-free quantum dots (CFQD) are being explored in
response to the heavy metal leaching concern. CFQD conjugated with tumor-targeting ligands or antibodies can be
synthesized using rare earth metal-doped oxide in phosphor,
which contains phosphorescent materials and ﬂuorescent
materials, having excitation wavelength in the UV spectrum
and emission wavelength controlled by the type of rare earth
doping. These particles have a large stokes shift, which is the
difference between the band maxima of the absorption and
emission spectra of the same electronic transition and
emission that is narrower than CdSe quantum dots. A recent
example are C-dots (Cornell-dots), which are silica-based
ﬂuorescent nanoparticles recently granted Investigational
New Drug status for cancer imaging by the FDA for clinical
evaluation in human phase I trials (29). These silica nanoparticles contain a dye glowing 3 times brighter than free
dyes when excited and might replace quantum dots without
toxicity-related concerns.
Regardless of chemical composition, the physiologic characteristics of nanoparticles are prone to change when in
contact with blood, which can cause toxicity (9). Blood
proteins interact with nanoparticles, which eventually modulate half-life and biodistribution (13). Formation of a protein corona over the surface of nanoparticles is well
described and believed to be a dynamic event, affecting the
hydrodynamic radius of nanoparticles to modulate stability
and overall surface functionality (13). Therefore, the physical
state, stability, and types of biomolecules on the nanoparticle surface under in vivo conditions can regulate pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties (13). In our opinion, complete characterization of any new nanoparticle
under physiologic conditions is important.

Recognition of nanoparticles by immune cells may activate
or suppress the immune system or be recognized as foreign
material and rapidly cleared from the body. These effects may
promote autoimmune or inﬂammatory disorders or make the
host prone to infections or cancer. Recognition of nanoparticles as foreign objects by immune cells could cause a multilevel
immune response, which might lead to toxicity, lack of therapeutic efﬁcacy, rapid clearance, or lethality (30). To reduce
this concern, the surface of nanoparticles can be coated with
nonopsonic proteins (31). Another possibility is to coat nanoparticles with a nonspeciﬁc antibody through its Fc domain or
with blood proteins. PEGylation is also frequently used to avoid
immune system recognition.
Lipid- and polymer-based nanoparticles are being widely
used for drug delivery applications, with some already
approved for clinical use (32). Positively charged liposomes
are toxic to cells compared with negatively charged or neutral
ones (33). However, because of electrostatic interaction with
negatively charged molecules such as nucleic acids (plasmids
or siRNA), cationic liposomes are useful for delivering these
genetic therapeutic agents into tumors. To minimize toxicity
mediated by the positive charge, incorporation of neutral or
negatively charged lipids can decrease the charge, thus reducing toxicity. Constituent lipids in nanoliposomes can also alter
normal immune function, causing toxic responses. Most nanoliposomal formulations are made up of phospholipids and
cholesterols, which are known to be biocompatible, but antiphospholipid and anti-cholesterol antibodies can cause
immune complement system activation (34). Thus, patients
having high titers of these antibodies may recognize these
nanoparticles and eliminate them from the body. Use of
natural lipids (such as occurring in archaeosomes) can reduce
this concern. Archaeosomes, made up of naturally occurring
archaeal membrane lipids, have been used for drug and vaccine
delivery (35).
Targeting nanoparticles to tumor cells to improve the
clinical potential of nanotechnology
Nanotechnology has potential for selectively delivering anticancer agents into tumor cells without affecting normal
healthy tissues. Many successful drug delivery strategies have
incorporated targeting capabilities of nanoparticles. However,
this area needs development and further implementation for
clinical applications. Nanoparticle-based drug and gene delivery or expression approaches occur through passive or active
targeting of tumor tissues.
Passive targeting. Passive targeting is mediated by the
inherent characteristics of the tumor itself to retain drugcarrying nanoparticles. Most passive targeting occurs because
of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect mediated by leaky vessels (36). Tumor blood vessels, unlike those
occurring in normal tissues, have 600 to 800 nm wide gaps
between adjacent endothelial cells, leading to a defective
vascular system with poor lymphatic drainage (36). This
enables nanoparticles to extravasate into the extravascular
space and accumulate in tumor tissues (36). A 10-fold increase
in drug retention is caused by the EPR effect when using
nanoparticles as delivery vehicles compared with free drug

5666

alone (37). However, as the environment inside the tumor is not
homogeneous, drug retention tends not to be uniform. Therefore, in our opinion, characteristics of tumor vasculature
anomalies should be exploited for better nanocarriers retention at the tumor site mediated by the EPR effect. For example,
use of angiotensin-II (AT-II), known to cause blood vessel
hypertension (38) can be used along with the drug carrying
nanoparticles. Hypertension induced by AT-II in normal tissues causes constriction of the vessel smooth muscle layer
resulting in higher blood pressure and ﬂow rates, while blood
ﬂow volume remains constant. Conversely, in tumor tissues,
because of absence of a smooth muscle layer in vessels, blood
ﬂow volume cannot be regulated; therefore, this hypertensive
state would boost the EPR effect and could be used to drive
nanoparticle accumulation in tumors, especially as vessel
density is higher in tumors than in normal tissues.
The tumor microenvironment can also modulate the passive
accumulation of nanoparticles. Tumor tissues have acidic
microenvironments ranging from a pH of 4 to 5, partly caused
by high rates of glycolysis and glucose consumption, metabolizing lactate even under aerobic conditions (39). Therefore,
use of pH-responsive nanoparticles can enhance passive drug
delivery in acidic tumor tissues. Protease-sensitive polymers
such as PEGDA peptide macromer containing MMP (matrix
metalloproteinases) substrate, polypeptides with a high
degradable (HD-MMP) and a low-degradability (LD-MMP)
sequence have already shown success in drug delivery in vivo
(40). MMPs are overexpressed in tumor tissues and degrade
extracellular matrix (41). Therefore, incorporation of MMPs in
nanoparticles could assist drug release into tumor tissues.
Synthesis of a polymeric nanoparticle containing a MMP
protease sensitive substrate polypeptide with a HD-MMP and
LD-MMP sequence and/or encapsulating pH or temperaturesensitive molecules can be used for passive accumulation and
destruction of tumors. Similarly, thermolabile nanoparticles
accumulating passively in tumors can be used to cause a local
hyperthermic effect to destroy tumors (42).
Active targeting. Active targeting requires nanoparticle
conjugation to antibodies, aptamers, cytokines, peptides, or
other relevant targeting ligands that can recognize markers on
the surface of cancer cells. Antibody-mediated targeted delivery of drug by gold, iron oxide, silica, liposomes, or polymeric
nanostructures can be used to deliver these agents to the
surface or into cancer cells (43). Monoclonal antibodies or
antibody fragments (such as antigen-binding fragments or
single-chain variable fragments) are being used as ligandtargeted therapies. Antibody fragments can be more useful
than antibodies because they tend to be less immunogenic, are
associated with decreased clearance rate, and increased circulation half-lives, which enables drug carrying nanoparticles
to have sufﬁcient time to be distributed and effectively bind to
targeted cancer cells in the body (44). Aptamers are DNA or
RNA 3-dimensional structures recognizing and binding to
speciﬁc target moieties and having similar selectivity as
antibodies. Aptamers can be better targeting agents than
antibodies because antibodies can have problems with conjugation, bad site speciﬁcity, and high immunogenicity, which
cause concerns for clinical applications. Recently, aptamer-

Limitations and Approaches of Cancer Nanotechnology

mediated cancer cell–speciﬁc cisplatin delivery has been found
effective for targeting multiple cancer cell lines (45). Aptamers
are generally thought not to be immunogenic and can be
cleared from the body after degradation by nucleases and are
thus associated with negligible toxicity.
Ligand receptor–based drug delivery approaches need significant improvement for clinical translation (46). For successful
ligand receptor–mediated drug delivery, internalization of the
targeted nanoparticle is essential (46). If antibodies or other
targeting ligands cannot mediate internalization, drug released
by the nanoparticles can be taken by cancer cells through simple
diffusion or by other similar transport mechanisms. Drug
released outside the cells can disperse into the surrounding
tissues, causing unwanted side effects and toxicity. Therefore,
our opinion is that targeted nanoparticles should always be
designed to initiate internalization into the cancer cell, which
can be achieved through selection of appropriate targeting
receptor or ligands. Molecules, such as antibodies, growth
factors, or cytokines, can facilitate nanoparticle uptake into
targeted cells by endocytosis (47). Bioactive peptides (<50 amino
acids) can also be used for this purpose. Tumor vasculature also
expresses angiogenic markers on the surface of blood vessels
that are absent or almost undetectable in normal blood vessels,
which are easily accessible and can be targeted (48).
Nanoparticle systems containing distinct targeting moieties
have been approved, and some are currently being evaluated in
clinical trials. For example, a recent phase I clinical trial in
humans used a transferrin-targeted nanoparticle designed by
self-assembly of siRNA, a cyclodextran-based polymer, adamantane-PEG, and adamantane-PEG-transferrin for uptake
into cancer cells (49). Another recent system involves approximately 7 nm C-dots for melanoma tumor imaging that were
conjugated to anb3 targeting moieties to mitigate issues related to size and promote tumor imaging for evaluation in phase I
trials (50). The biggest concern is the cost that the targeting
moiety adds to the ﬁnal drug product; however, we feel the
beneﬁt outweighs this concern.
Masking of targeted or nontargeted nanoparticles can be
used to enhance uptake in tumor tissue. Macrophages and
phagocytes can recognize nanoparticles circulating in the
blood, so strategies are needed to make the nanoparticles
"invisible" to the immune cells to facilitate uptake. "Stealthy"
nanoparticles have been made by PEGylation of the surface,
which makes them less detectable by phagocytes (51). Similarly, use of hydrophilic polymers (such as poloxamine, poloxamers, and polysaccharides) to cap conventional nanoparticles
can decrease uptake by the mononuclear phagocytes system
(MPS; ref. 52). The coating provides a dynamic "cloud" of
hydrophilic and neutral functional groups on the surface,

repelling plasma proteins and makes the nanoparticle MPS
invisible (53). This increases the circulation time and promotes
the potential for better drug retention and thus efﬁcacy. As
described above, nanoparticles are prone to be coated by
proteins from body ﬂuids to form a "corona," which might
lead to the opsonization and phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelium system (13). PEG coating can provide steric hindrance to nanoparticles to decrease aggregation during circulation, thereby preventing opsonization and increasing the
circulatory half-life, which results in a greater EPR effect.
However, PEG coating can have negative effects because the
longer circulation time may delay the uptake of nanoparticles
by tumor cells. Therefore, in our opinion, it is important to
consider these issues and balance them to create nanoparticles
that are stable in body ﬂuids with optimal circulation half-lives
for maximal delivery of the drug into tumor tissue.

Conclusion
Cancer nanotechnology is gaining importance as an approach
to overcome obstacles faced by traditional cancer drugs.
However, this technology faces hurdles that need to be surmounted to realize its full clinical potential. Nanoparticle
toxicity and directed delivery to cancer cells are concerns,
requiring better characterization of nanoparticles, understanding the behavior and type of interactions with human
tissues and ﬂuids. Immune system concerns also require
careful consideration when using this technology. Despite
these issues, nanotechnology remains a useful approach to
develop drug vehicles for combining multiple cooperating
anticancer agents. This approach can provide innovative strategies for solid tumor oncology research, but targeted delivery is
needed to improve speciﬁcity and reduce unwanted side
effects. To take advantage of the full potential of nanotechnology, the collaborative efforts of experts in nanotechnology,
physics, chemistry, biology, and oncologists are needed to
resolve issues associated with toxicity and targeted delivery.
