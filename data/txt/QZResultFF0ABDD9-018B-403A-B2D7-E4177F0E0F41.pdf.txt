Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of tumor cells represents a major hurdle to efﬁcient cancer
therapy. Although resistance is a characteristic of tumor cells that evolve in a low oxygen environment (hypoxia),
the mechanisms involved remain elusive. We observed that mitochondria of certain hypoxic cells take on an
enlarged appearance with reorganized cristae. In these cells, we found that a major mitochondrial protein
regulating metabolism and apoptosis, the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), was linked to chemoresistance when in a truncated (VDAC1-DC) but active form. The formation of truncated VDAC1, which had a
similar channel activity and voltage dependency as full-length, was hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-dependent
and could be inhibited in the presence of the tetracycline antibiotics doxycycline and minocycline, known
inhibitors of metalloproteases. Its formation was also reversible upon cell reoxygenation and associated with cell
survival through binding to the antiapoptotic protein hexokinase. Hypoxic cells containing VDAC1-DC were less
sensitive to staurosporine- and etoposide-induced cell death, and silencing of VDAC1-DC or treatment with the
tetracycline antibiotics restored sensitivity. Clinically, VDAC1-DC was detected in tumor tissues of patients with
lung adenocarcinomas and was found more frequently in large and late-stage tumors. Together, our ﬁndings show
that via induction of VDAC1-DC, HIF-1 confers selective protection from apoptosis that allows maintenance of
ATP and cell survival in hypoxia. VDAC1-DC may also hold promise as a biomarker for tumor progression in
chemotherapy-resistant patients. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2140–50. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
It is well established that cells exposed to the limiting oxygen
microenvironment (hypoxia) of tumors acquire resistance to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (1). However, the mechanisms involved and the implication of the key factor of the
hypoxic response, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), have not
been extensively investigated (2). We recently reported that

several types of cancer cells exposed to a hypoxic microenvironment showed enlarged mitochondria with reorganized
cristae; a result of modiﬁcations to fusion/ﬁssion (3). In
addition, we showed that these cells were resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.
Because mitochondria regulate both metabolism and apoptosis (4–6) and that fusion/ﬁssion participates in apoptosis
(7), we investigated whether certain mitochondrial proteins
implicated in these processes play a role in resistance to
apoptosis in a HIF-dependent manner.
The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) regulates
mitochondrial import and export of Ca2þ and metabolites
including ATP and NADH and interacts with antiapoptotic
proteins such as Bcl-2 and hexokinase in controlling the release
of cytochrome c (8–11). Of note, screening by RNA interference
identiﬁed VDAC1 as a protein implicated in resistance to
cisplatin-induced cell death (12). In mammals VDAC is present
in 3 highly homologous isoforms: VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3,
and VDAC1 is composed of 19 amphipathic b strands that form
a b barrel and of a mobile N-terminal a helix, located inside the
pore (13). Through binding to VDAC1 hexokinase, the enzyme
that catalyzes the ﬁrst step of glycolysis is optimally positioned
for ATP capture (14) and hexokinase expression is increase
by HIF (15). Thus, these interactions inﬂuence the function of

both hexokinase and VDAC in cell death and metabolism.
However, the role of VDAC in metabolism and apoptosis in
hypoxia is not known.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
LS174, PC3, HeLa, 786-O, SKMel, and A549 cells were grown
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with 5% or 10% inactivated FBS as appropriate in
penicillin G (50 U/mL) and streptomycin sulfate (50 mg/mL).
Dr. van de Wetering provided LS174 cells expressing the
tetracycline repressor. A Bug-Box anaerobic workstation (Ruskinn Technology Biotrace International Plc.) set at 1% oxygen,
94% nitrogen, and 5% carbon dioxide was used for hypoxia.
Transfection of short interfering RNA
The 21-nucleotide RNAs were synthesized (Eurogentec).
siRNA sequences targeting SIMA (siCtl), and HIF-1a were
described previously (16). The short interfering RNA (siRNA)
sequences targeting human VDAC1, VDAC2, VDAC3, and
hexokinase II are given in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. HeLa cells were transfected with 40 nmol/L of siRNA
24 hours before normoxia or hypoxia, as described (3).
Reconstitution of puriﬁed VDAC1 and VDAC1-DC into a
planar lipid bilayer, single-channel current recording
and data analysis
VDAC1 and VDAC1-DC were puriﬁed from hypoxic HeLa
cells after solubilizing in lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO)
and chromatography on hydroxyapetite, as described (17).
Elution with increasing Pi concentrations separated VDAC1
and VDAC1-DC. The fractions containing either VDAC1 or
VDAC1-DC were used for channel reconstitution into a planar
lipid bilayer (PLB). A PLB was prepared from soybean asolectin
dissolved in n-decane (50 mg/mL) and puriﬁed VDAC1 or
VDAC1-DC was added to the cis chamber containing 1 mol/L
NaCl and 10 m mol/L HEPES, pH, 7.4, unless otherwise
indicated. After one or a few channels were inserted into the
PLB, currents were recorded by voltage clamping with a Bilayer
Clamp BC-525B Ampliﬁer (Warner Instruments), the current
trace duration was 4 or 10 seconds. Current was measured with
respect to the trans side of the membrane (ground). The
current was digitized on-line with a Digidata 1200 interface
board and PCLAMP 6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.).
Patients and tissue sample preparation
Forty-four patients who underwent surgery for lung adenocarcinoma between May 2007 and May 2010 at the Pasteur
Hospital (Department of Thoracic Surgery, CHU de Nice, Nice,
France) were selected. The patients received the necessary
information concerning the study and consent was obtained.
The study obtained approval of the ethics committee (CHU de
Nice). The main clinical and histopathologic data are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Morphologic classiﬁcation of
the tumors was assigned according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria (18). The tumors were staged
according to the international tumor-node-metastasis system

www.aacrjournals.org

(19). Follow-up data for all the patients were collected regularly. The median follow-up was 21 months (3.8–38.2 months).
Among these patients, 13 relapsed (29.5%) and 6 (13.6%) died.
Protein and miRNA were extracted from the same tissue
sample using the protocol AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein from
QIAGEN.
Statistics
All values are the means  SD of the indicated number of
determinations (n), and signiﬁcant differences are based on the
Student t test and P values indicated. All categorical data used
numbers and percentages. Quantitative data were presented
using the median and range or mean. Differences between
groups were evaluated using the c2 test for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous variables. SPSS 16.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc.) was used. All statistical tests
were 2-sided, and P values less than 0.05 indicated statistical
signiﬁcance whereas P values between 0.05 and 0.10 indicated a
statistical tendency.

Results
Hypoxic cells with enlarged mitochondria are resistant
to chemotherapy and resistance implicates
mitochondrial proteins
We reported that certain tumor-derived cell lines exposed to
hypoxia showed a tubular mitochondrial network (PC3,
SKMel) whereas others showed enlarged mitochondria (LS174,
HeLa, A549; ref. 3). All cells showed a mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dym) that was unchanged compared
with normoxic cells but the latter group was resistant to
staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis. We now show that
when hypoxic LS174 cells with enlarged mitochondria were
treated with STS, the Dym decreased in normoxia but
remained unaffected in hypoxia (Fig. 1A). In normoxia, LS174
cells released mitochondrial cytochrome c when incubated
with STS whereas hypoxic LS174 cells with enlarged mitochondria did not (Fig. 1B). To address the implication of
antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family in hypoxic resistance
to STS-induced apoptosis, we tested the effect of the BH3
domain mimetic ABT-737, an inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (20)
on the apoptosis resistance of hypoxic cells. ABT-737 restored
apoptosis as induced by STS in hypoxic LS174 cells (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that association with a BH3 domain protein is
implicated in resistance.
To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind
resistance we compared the normoxic and hypoxic levels of
anti- and proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (Fig. 1D).
LS174 and PC3 cells incubated in hypoxia (72 hours) were
resistant or sensitive to STS-induced apoptosis, respectively.
Bax and tBID were not or only slightly detected in LS174 cells
(Fig. 1D) while the expression of Bak and Bcl-XL were slightly
enhanced in LS174 cells. Because Bcl-XL has been described to
interact with VDAC1 (21), we examined the level of VDAC. We
observed hypoxic induction of a faster migrating SDS-PAGE
form of VDAC in LS174 but not in PC3 cells (Fig. 1D). Immunoblots of mitochondrial fractions conﬁrmed mitochondrial
origin (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The hypoxic induction of the formation of a smaller
relative molecular mass form of VDAC is dependent on
HIF-1 activation
Because an additional VDAC form was observed in hypoxicresistant cells with enlarged mitochondria, and not in sensitive
cells, we focused on the hypoxic induction of this form.
As HIF-1 is essential in adaptation to hypoxia, we checked
whether HIF-1 was involved in the formation of this form.
When HIF-1a was silenced hypoxic cells did not contain the
faster migrating form (Fig. 2A), but a normal mitochondrial
morphology was restored (data not shown). Similar results
were obtained for LS174 and A549 cells (data not shown). Thus
HIF-1 initiates hypoxia-induced VDAC.

is a C-terminal–truncated VDAC1
We quantiﬁed the mRNA expression of VDAC1, VDAC2,
and VDAC3 in normoxia and hypoxia but did not observe
hypoxic induction of these isoforms (Fig. 2B). siRNA directed
to the mRNA of the 3 isoforms gave knockdown of the
corresponding VDAC isoform (Fig. 2B). Knockdown was
conﬁrmed at the protein level and identiﬁed the different
isoforms (Fig. 2C). The top band corresponded to VDAC1,
the intermediate band to VDAC3, and the bottom band to a
faster migrating form of VDAC1. The identity of VDAC1 was
conﬁrmed with another VDAC1-speciﬁc antibody, but

directed to the N-terminus, and both forms were silenced
with siRNA (Fig. 2D).
We considered the possibility that the fast migrating VDAC1
resulted from alternative splicing or hypoxia-mediated translation by internal ribosome entry but did not ﬁnd any evidence
to support either possibility (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Finally, the faster migrating VDAC1 was not detected with a
VDAC1 antibody directed to the C-terminus (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the C-terminus of the protein was truncated (VDAC1DC). Doxycycline, a second-generation tetracycline that has
cytoprotective and metal chelator effects, was found to diminish the formation of VDAC1-DC (Fig. 2E). Because metal
chelators increase the stability of HIF-1a we examined the
level of HIF-1a but found only a slight increase when the fast
migrating form of VDAC1 was signiﬁcantly decreased (60%, 60

mg/mL doxycycline; Fig. 2E). Minocycline, another tetracycline
antibiotic, which exerts uncoupling and inhibiting effects on
mitochondrial respiration (22), also inhibited formation (Fig.
2F), and partially restored normal mitochondrial morphology
(Fig. 2G). Because tetracycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases we tested a number of protease inhibitors, but they
did not inhibit formation of VDAC1-DC (data not shown). The
possibility of posttranslational cleavage of VDAC1, as
described previously (23), is the most likely explanation for
the appearance of VDAC1-DC.
VDAC1-DC is associated with cell survival in hypoxia
We then hypothesized that VDAC1-DC could be involved in
hypoxic resistance to apoptosis. Silencing of VDAC1 and
VDAC1-DC decreased the number of enlarged mitochondria

and restored the tubular mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 3A).
To evaluate the sensitivity to an apoptotic stimulus of normoxic and hypoxic LS174 cells, we determined the caspase-3
and -7 activity in cells exposed to STS, an inducer of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis, and to etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor used in cancer therapy (Fig. 3B). The
caspase activity was the same in cells in normoxia or hypoxia,
indicating that there was no induction of cell death in hypoxia.
Silencing of VDAC1 in hypoxia partially reestablished the
sensitivity of hypoxic LS174 cells to apoptosis (Fig. 3B).

Two additional cell lines were examined for enlarged mitochondria, VDAC1-DC, and resistance to STS-induced apoptosis. SKMel cells did not show any of these features whereas
A549 cells showed all of them (Supplementary Fig. S3), as for
HeLa cells (Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig. S4). We then
questioned which form of VDAC1 (full-length or truncated)
was responsible for triggering resistance. In hypoxia, the level
of VDAC1 decreased by around 50% (Fig. 3C) whereas VDAC1DC increased by around 50%, which supported posttranslational cleavage of VDAC1. The silencing of vdac1 in normoxic

VDAC1-DC Mediates Hypoxic Chemoresistance

cells was associated with a change in mitochondrial morphology, as visualized with anticytochrome c (Fig. 3D) and a
decrease in VDAC1 in hypoxia (Fig. 3E). However, these cells
showed an increase in apoptosis with STS (Fig. 3B), suggesting
that the decrease in VDAC1 in normoxia was not responsible
for the protection against apoptosis. Moreover, silencing of
HIF-1a (þTet) in hypoxia with STS (Fig. 2A) restored sensitivity to apoptosis (data not shown). We thus concluded that
resistance to apoptosis was associated with VDAC1-DC. To
evaluate this further, cells were placed in hypoxia and then
reoxygenated. The level of VDAC1-DC was maintained for 4
hours after reoxygenation, then progressively decreased after 8
hours and disappeared at 48 hours (Fig. 3F). As expected, the
level of VDAC1 was inversely proportionate to that of VDAC1DC. We showed previously that during the ﬁrst 24 hours of
reoxygenation, cells were protected from apoptosis (3). Transient exogenous overexpression of a small form of VDAC1
truncated by 5 kDa in the C-terminus, pVDAC1-5kDaDC (Fig.
3G), in cells exposed for 4 hours to STS showed a slight
resistance to apoptosis (Fig. 3H). Finally, in the presence of
doxycycline (Fig. 2E) or minocyclin (Fig. 2F), hypoxic cells were
no longer protected from STS (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these
results show that both the enlarged morphology of mitochondria and VDAC1-DC participate in protection against apoptosis in hypoxic LS174, A549, and HeLa cells exposed to STS or
etoposide.
VDAC1-DC has the same channel activity and voltage
dependency as VDAC1 and binds Bcl-XL
VDAC1 and VDAC1-DC proteins were puriﬁed from hypoxic
HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) and their channel activity was examined
following reconstitution into a PLB. The current through lipid
bilayer–reconstituted VDAC1 (fraction 12) or VDAC1-DC (fraction 22) in response to a voltage step from 0 to 10 or to 40
mV (Fig. 4B and C) was the same for the 2 proteins. At 10 mV,
the channel conductance of both proteins was the same (30
pA). At a higher voltage of 40 mV, the full-length channel
showed 2 major conducting states with higher occupancy at
the closed substate (S1), whereas VDAC1-DC showed higher
open-state occupancy (O) in comparison to the occupancy of
low-conducting substates (S1, S2; Fig. 4C). Both channels
showed similar but not identical voltage-dependent conductance. At the high voltages, VDAC1-DC showed slightly higher
conductance than VDAC1 (Fig. 4D), in agreement with the
single-channel experiments [Fig. 4B(ii) and C(ii)]. The voltage sensitivity of VDAC1-DC suggests the presence of the
N-terminus, conferring voltage gating of the channel (8).
VDAC1-DC showed similar Ca2þ conductance to VDAC1,
but at higher voltages spent a longer time in its open state, as
reﬂected in the decreased voltage sensitivity (Fig. 4E).
For example, at þ40 mV the Ca2þ conductance VDAC1-DC
was about 1.4-fold higher than that of VDCA1 (Fig. 4E).
VDAC1-DC, like VDAC1, interacted with puriﬁed Bcl-XL(DC)
and decreased its channel conductance (Fig. 4F). Similar
results were obtained with hexokinase I from rat brain (data
not shown). These results suggest that the C-terminal
domain is not required for the interaction of these antiapoptotic proteins with VDAC1.

VDAC1-DC forms a complex with hexokinase II and is
associated with cell survival in hypoxia
As hexokinase II is a major player in maintaining the highly
malignant state of cancer cells (24), we focused on interaction
between hexokinase II and VDACs in hypoxia. Immunoprecipitates with antihexokinase II contained VDAC1, VDAC3, and
VDAC1-DC (Fig. 5A). In addition, the hexokinase II expression
level was substantially increased in hypoxia (Fig. 5B). Silencing
of more than 90% of the hypoxia-inducible expression of
hexokinase II decreased considerably the level of VDAC1-DC
(Fig. 5B). Silencing of hexokinase II in normoxia did not affect
the level of VDAC1. Conversely, silencing of VDAC1 in normoxia and hypoxia decreased slightly the level of hexokinase II
(Fig. 5B). These results were conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence; no or little labeling was observed with anti-VDAC in
cells silenced for either hexokinase II or VDACs (Fig. 5C). In
addition, a more intense and punctate immunoﬂuorescence
was observed with anti-VDAC in VDAC1-DC–containing cells
incubated in hypoxia than in normoxia (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Clotrimazole (CTM) and bifonazole (BFN) induce apoptosis by detaching hexokinase from mitochondria (17, 25). Both
agents increased mortality to a similar extent to that for VDAC
silencing (Fig. 5D) and the mortality was enhanced in cells in
hypoxia in their presence. This suggested that VDAC1-DC
interacted with hexokinase II, as did puriﬁed hexokinase I,
which decreased VDAC1-DC channel conductance. To better
understand the role of VDAC1 and hexokinase II in cell survival
in hypoxia, we silenced VDAC1 or hexokinase II and tested cell
proliferation/death and ATP and lactate production in normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia does not kill cells (26), but it slows
proliferation, as shown by a 3-fold decrease in the area of
colonies of cells after 10 days in hypoxia (Fig. 5E). Transient
silencing of VDAC1 (siVDAC1) in hypoxia had no impact on cell
survival but affected proliferation (P < 0.01), whereas silencing
of hexokinase II (siHKII) strongly inhibited survival (Fig. 5E). As
hexokinase II and VDAC1 form a complex and silencing of
hexokinase II decreased the level of VDAC1 in cells (Fig. 5B), we
hypothesized that hexokinase II interfered with ATP transport
and thereby its production via its interaction with VDAC1-DC.
Cells produced almost 2 times more ATP in hypoxia (Fig. 5F).
Silencing of VDAC1 decreased hypoxic but not normoxic
production of ATP, suggesting that VDAC1-DC inﬂuenced ATP
production (Supplementary Fig. S6). This could reﬂect the
impact of VDAC1 silencing on hexokinase II expression. As
expected the silencing of hexokinase II in hypoxia decreased
ATP. Lactate production, which reﬂects ATP synthesis via
glycolysis, was increased in hypoxia and diminished with
VDAC1 or hexokinase II silencing (Fig. 5G). Taken together,
these results conﬁrm that VDAC1 is involved in energy homeostasis and points to VDAC1-DC as an essential actor in both
glycolysis and mitochondrial energy production in hypoxia
probably through interaction with hexokinase.
VDAC1-DC is present in tissues of patients with lung
adenocarcinoma and is more frequently detected in
late-stage rather than in early-stage tumors
Because we detected both VDAC1 and VDAC1-DC in
hypoxic A549 lung carcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S3),

Discussion
Herein, we showed that hypoxia induces the appearance of a
C-terminal truncated form of VDAC1. The mechanism regulating formation was HIF dependent and the truncated form
possessed channel activity, interacted with Bcl-XL and hexokinase I, both of which protect against apoptosis.
Interaction of VDACs with Bcl-2 family members is
implicated in translocation of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane (21). Nonetheless, it has been
reported that the 3 isoforms are dispensable for mitochondrial-dependent cell death, but this was showed in a
cellular and environmental context that was neither malignant nor hypoxic (30). In addition, VDAC2 but not VDAC1
has been shown to inhibit Bak-mediated mitochondrial
apoptosis (31). It is possible to hypothesize that changes
in the expression of Bcl-2 proteins are implicated directly
in resistance. Cytoprotection of lung cancer cells to cisplatin correlated with suppression of activation of Bax but
not Bak by cisplatin (12). However, in our study the Bax
protein was not detected in LS174 cells. In addition, there
exists an intricate crosstalk between the machineries of
mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and ﬁssion), thus morphology, and apoptosis (32, 33). Both antiapoptotic (Bcl2) and proapoptotic (Bak and Bax) proteins interact with
proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (mitofusins) and
ﬁssion (dynamin-related GTPases). Thus, we may speculate
that modiﬁcations in the expression of Bak and Bcl-XL
correlate with the morphologic alterations observed. In
addition, the increases in Bak and Bcl-XL in hypoxic LS174
cells correlated with the morphologic alteration in hypoxia.

www.aacrjournals.org

It may also be hypothesized that the increase in the
expression of Bcl-X L and the modiﬁcation of the open
conﬁguration of the VDAC1-DC channel by Bcl-XL inhibits
mitochondrial ATP/ADP exchange, which favors ATP production through glycolysis. A shift toward glycolysis is a
characteristic of hypoxic cancer cells and may explain
survival and thus resistance when confronted with a potentially lethal agent. The observed change in organization of
the cristae of the mitochondria may also rupture the
interaction between VDAC and the adenine nucleotide
translocase thereby leading to a change in VDAC-mediated
ATP transport. In addition, if VDAC oligomerization is
responsible for cytochrome c release in apoptosis (11), a
change in its conformation may block cytochrome c in the
mitochondrial intermembrane space and thus diminish
apoptosis.
The notion that resistance of hypoxic regions of tumors to
chemotherapy (34) is associated with hypoxic VDAC1-DC and
Bcl-XL is supported by reports showing that protection of
HepG2 cells against etoposide-induced apoptosis was HIF1a dependent (35) and that Bcl-XL is induced by HIF (36).
Because we detected VDAC1-DC in tumor tissue of patients
(50%) and that the frequency of positivity for VDAC1-DC was
higher in late-stage tumors than in early-stage tumors, we
believe that VDAC1-DC represents a product of tumor progression. Gene expression of VDAC1 has been reported to
predict poor outcome in early-stage non–small cell lung cancer
(37). In addition, VDAC1 was shown to be upregulated in
prednisolone-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells but
not in resistant cells (38).
In conclusion, our results point to modiﬁcations in mitochondrial dynamics and production of VDAC1-DC as a
survival response in hypoxic cancer cells that resist apoptosis. Because agents that promote apoptosis may hold therapeutic beneﬁt, these results may have important repercussions for combating cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.
A synthetic lethality approach targeting RAS tumor cells
identiﬁed a small-molecule inhibitor of VDAC2 that induced
changes in mitochondrial morphology and cell death (39).
We propose that VDAC1-DC may be a potential biomarker to
stratify patients with respect to tumor progression and that
the VDAC1-DC/hexokinase complex may be a cancer speciﬁc target for therapy.
