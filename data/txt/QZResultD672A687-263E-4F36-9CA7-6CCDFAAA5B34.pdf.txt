BACKGROUND. Patients with localized esophageal cancer (LEC) have diverse outcomes (post-therapy pathologic response, disease-free survival [DFS], and overall
survival [OS]) after preoperative chemoradiation (P-CTRT), dictated also by inherent molecular heterogeneity. Whether the type of therapy influences the outcomes
remains largely unanswered. It is hypothesized that induction chemotherapy (IC)
or the type of cytotoxics used would not influence patient outcomes.

METHODS. In this retrospective analysis, consecutive patients with LEC who had
P-CTRT were analyzed. Data were collected regarding age, sex, baseline clinical
stage, location, type of cytotoxics, post-therapy pathology, DFS, and OS. IC and
the type of cytotoxics used were found to be correlated with DFS, OS, and posttherapy pathologic response.

RESULTS. A total of 180 patients with LEC (119 had IC before P-CTRT, all had
received 5-fluorouracil, 87 had received a taxane, and 57 had received a platinol)

ocalized carcinoma of the esophagus (LEC) represents a special
management challenge. Despite the lack of convincing data to
support the use of preoperative therapy (induction chemotherapy
[IC] or preoperative chemoradiation [P-CTRT]),1-4 the use of P-CTRT
is a common practice in cancer centers, universities, and many
communities.5 5-fluorouracil has been traditionally used with radiotherapy for LEC and it is often combined with other agents, but is
used predominantly with cisplatin based on a randomized trial.6
However, with the demonstrated activity of taxanes7 there has been
a proliferation of newer combinations of cytotoxics used concurrently with radiation. There is increasing evidence that any 1 combi-

nation, regardless of whether it incorporates a newer
agent, has not been demonstrated to be superior to
another. Institutional preferences have dominated
cancer practices and this is best reflected in the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
for esophageal cancer.8 In addition, a review of 18 of
what to our knowledge are the largest phase 2 studies published to date, which evaluated whether
post-therapy pathologic response and overall survival
(OS) differed according to the various combinations
of agents used, found that the outcomes after PCTRT were generally similarly heterogeneous but
with the same rate of pathologic complete response
and 5-year survival rates.9 A recent small study from
Duke University demonstrated that the addition of a
taxane does not improve the outcome of patients
with esophageal cancer.10 Smaller studies tended to
have an unexpected outcome (excellent or poor),
again because of patient selection and a higher level
of variance in the molecular composition of cancer.
Given the apparent lack of advantage when the
available cytotoxics were combined with radiation,
we described a treatment approach using induction
chemotherapy (IC) before P-CTRT.11 Although we
have used IC in various clinical trials, to our knowledge its value in LEC patients has not yet been
established. To address this question we designed a
prospective, randomized trial, which is currently
accruing patients at our institution.
However, it is important to note that there is
considerable molecular heterogeneity in patients
with LEC.12,13 Molecular heterogeneity of LEC may
be responsible for the diverse outcome of patients
and this outcome is likely not influenced significantly
by the types of cytotoxics available to date. This issue
is considerably complex and it will require an indepth study of molecular biology of LEC and patient
genetic profiles.
To assess whether our future research endeavors
should emphasize empirically chosen clinical trials
for patients with LEC or we should first gain a
greater understanding of the molecular biology of
LEC, we decided to review our more recent clinical
experience with regard to the influence of IC or the
chosen cytotoxic agents on post-therapy pathologic
response, disease-free survival (DFS), and OS. The
data are presented on 180 retrospectively reviewed
consecutive patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients with potentially resectable, biopsy-proven
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, locally

1303

confined to either the thoracic esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction, who were evaluated at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
from 2002 through early 2007 were eligible. Resectability and operability was determined by patient
evaluation by a multidisciplinary team including
medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, radiation
oncologists, and thoracic oncologic surgeons.
Patients with type 1 or type 2 (using the Siewert
Classification14) esophageal cancers and M1a disease
were included, whereas those with T1N0 and M1b
disease were excluded.
Pretreatment investigations of the patients with
LEC included a complete blood count, measurement
of serum electrolytes, chest radiograph, computed
tomography (CT) scan of chest and abdomen, barium swallow radiography, upper gastroesophageal
endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound, and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan (when possible).

Study Design
The objectives of the current analysis were 1) to
compare the outcomes (specifically, OS, DFS, and
pathologic response) of patients with LEC who
received IC plus P-CTRT versus those treated with PCTRT alone, and 2) to assess the effect of specific cytotoxic agents (namely, taxanes and platinols) used
on treatment response.
Chemotherapy
Because all our patients received 5-fluorouracil, the
current study focused on 2 other major categories of
cytotoxics commonly used to treat LEC: taxanes and
platinols. The 2 classes of cytotoxics were given to
the majority of patients in this cohort.
Chemoradiotherapy
All patients received 5-fluorouracil concurrently with
radiation. The additional drug(s) in the large homogenous groups was either a platinol or taxane. Some
patients received an agent from all 3 classes of cytotoxics. The total radiation dose delivered was either
45 grays (Gy) in 25 fractions or 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions, at 1.8 Gy per fraction delivered once daily,
5 days per week.
Surgery
Patients were evaluated before surgery using barium
swallow radiography, CT scan of the chest and abdomen, esophagoscopy, and PET scan (when possible).
All patients underwent surgery. Surgical procedures
performed included 3-field esophagectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy, transthoracic esophagectomy, or

minimally invasive esophagectomy. The resected surgical specimen from each patient was examined to
determine the degree of pathologic response based
on the criteria described previously.15,16
Information regarding OS and DFS was obtained
for each patient. Data were collected from the hospital
records, patient follow-up data, death records, and the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center tumor registry.

Statistical Methods
The Fisher exact test and chi-square Pearson test
were used to determine associations between clinicopathologic variables and clinical outcome. Survival
analyses were performed for OS and DFS time. OS
was defined as the time from registration into the
trial to death. When the date of death was not available, then the last follow-up date was used instead.
Data from patients who had not died by the time of
analysis were censored. DFS was defined as the time
from surgical resection to disease recurrence or until
the last follow-up date if the data of disease recurrence or death were not available. Data from patients
who were alive without disease at the time of analysis were censored. All statistical analyses were 2sided and performed at a .05 significance level. The
SAS software package (version 6.12) was used for
computations (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Table 1. The median age at the time of presentation
was 60 years (range, 25-78 years) and the majority of
patients (93%) were men. In all, 173 patients (96%)
had adenocarcinoma, 6 (3.5%) had squamous cell
carcinoma, and 1 (0.5%) had adenosquamous carcinoma. In addition, the tumor location, classified as
per the Siewert classification,14 was type 1 in 64.5%
and type 2 in 35.5% of patients. Sixty-seven (37%)
patients had stage IIA cancer, 10 (5.5%) patients had
stage IIB cancer, 96 (53.5%) patients had stage III
cancer, and 7 (4%) patients were staged as having
stage IVA cancer. A total of 119 (66%) received IC followed by P-CTRT and 61 (34%) received P-CTRT
alone.

Outcome of the Entire Cohort
Seventy-one (39.5%) patients were treated off clinical
trials for a variety of reasons. One hundred eight
(60%) patients underwent a transthoracic esophagectomy and 72 (40%) received a transhiatal approach. R0 resection was achieved in 151 (84%)
patients. Forty-three (24%) had a complete pathologic response, 69 (38%) had 1% to 10% residual cancer, 41 (23%) had 11% to 50% residual cancer, and 27
(15%) had >50% residual cancer.
At a median follow-up of 20.1 months (range,
3.1-113 months), the median survival of 180 patients
was 57.7 months. The 3-year OS rate was 65.4% and
the 5-year OS rate was 46.5%. Sixty-five (36%)
patients developed disease recurrence or metastasis
and the median DFS was 13 months (range, 0-108.7
months). Data are summarized in Table 2.

compared with 18% for the group that did not
receive IC (P 5 .18) (Table 3). The median survival of
the patients receiving IC had not been reached at the
time of last follow-up, but it was 54.6 months for the
group that did not receive IC. This difference in median survival did not reach statistical significance
(P 5 .58) (Fig. 1). The OS rates at 3 years and 5 years
were 65.3% and 51%, respectively, for those who
received IC and 67.6% and 34.4%, respectively, for
those who did not receive IC (Table 4). The DFS
between these 2 groups was also not statistically significantly different (P 5 .59) (Fig. 2).
All patients were treated with 5-flurouracil. The
largest homogenous patient groups undergoing IC
and P-CTRT were those receiving taxanes (n 5 87),
platinols (n 5 57), or both (n 5 32). The pathologic

complete response rate did not differ significantly in

(P 5 .64) (Table 4). No overall difference was noted
in the OS or DFS between patients treated with taxanes, platinols, or both (OS, P 5 .58; DFS, P 5 .90)
(Figs. 3 and 4).

DISCUSSION
The incidence of carcinoma of the esophagus has
steadily increased over the last 18 years, with a >40%

increase since 1990 according to the American Cancer Society statistics (available at: www.cancer.org
accessed January 15, 2008). This trend, influenced by
the sequelae of the increasing body mass index of
the American population, including a higher incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, and consequent Barrett esophagus, is not likely to diminish
soon.17,18 The 5-year survival rates for patients with
LEC continue to remain dismal despite considerable
advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
The progress using modern treatment techniques has
been limited to reductions in the treatment-related
morbidity and mortality rather than in the improvement in the disease-related OS.
There has been considerable interest in new
classes of cytotoxic agents, which has led to the
investigations of multiple combinations, particularly
with radiotherapy. However, to our knowledge, after
nearly 15 years of these studies, no single combination has emerged nor has been widely accepted as
being superior to the others. In the current study we
reviewed our experience to determine whether various combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs or the
use of IC in our patients had resulted in any therapeutic advantage. Although retrospective reviews are

inherently limited, clues to potential benefits in
treatment approaches may often be gleaned. In this
analysis of 180 patients there were subtle but nonsignificant trends toward improved pathologic complete response and a higher 5-year OS rate in
patients who received IC compared with those not
receiving IC. Although in a previously reported retrospective analysis a trend in favor of IC (P 5 .04 by
univariate analysis), particularly for patients with
advanced stage LEC, was observed, IC was not found
to be an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis.19 In addition, the impact of different
classes of cytotoxics on OS, DFS, and pathologic
response has not been widely reported to date. We
believe that we can expect only a minimum or no
advantage from our traditional approach of combining different classes of drugs to be given concurrently
with radiotherapy in patients with LEC.10 At our
institution, the focus has been on establishing a regimen that contains 2 cytotoxic agents administered
with radiotherapy so that the chosen chemoradiation
is fairly well tolerated and may allow the addition of
a biologic agent without incurring prohibitive toxicity. In our experience, the combination of docetaxel
with a fluoropyrimidine given concurrently with
radiotherapy results in a reasonable baseline regimen

Therapy Selection and Patient Outcome/Javeri et al

that is tolerated by the majority of patients. Whether
IC provides an OS advantage remains largely unclear
and still remains a contemporary question for this
group of patients. Our retrospective review suggests
that IC may not have a big impact on patient outcome but to our knowledge prospective data are not
yet available. Thus, it appears that we may have
reached a plateau in the treatment of LEC.
We believe that further progress in therapy may
be achieved by investigating the molecular biology of
esophageal cancer. We have previously documented
that chemoradiation-resistant LEC also tend to be
metastatic.20 Furthermore, our investigations have
identified NF-jB as a potential biomarker associated
with the metastatic progression of LEC,13,21 and
sonic hedgehog as a molecule often associated with
LEC chemoradioresistance.22,23 It is interesting that
in our preliminary study we were able to find 2 molecular subtypes of esophageal cancer.12 In an unsupervised cluster analysis of gene expression profile, 5
of 6 patients clustered in molecular subtype I, which
has a molecular profile similar to squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 of 6 patients with a pathologic complete response congregated in molecular subtype II,
which has a more resistant adenocarcinoma profile.
When greater than 2-fold differences in gene expression levels were sought, a list of 80 genes emerged
and these were related to the NF-jB pathway, apoptosis, proliferation, and early progenitor or cancer
stem cells (sonic hedgehog). Three genes (PERP,
S100A2, and SPRR3) were found to be closely associated with pathologic complete response. To further
explore these findings, it was noted that S100A2 and
SPRR3 were located on chromosome 1q21, and this
region might be important in mediating chemoradiation resistance.24 We found that the decreased
expression of epidermal differentiation complex was
associated with chemoradiation resistance. The other
aspect of response to therapy may be embedded in
the genetics of the host because any defect in metabolic and repair pathways, reflected in polymorphisms, might have a bearing on clinical outcome and
toxicity.25 It is clear, however, that considerably more
investigation is required to begin to elucidate this
complex biologic process and may lead to the identification of novel exploitable targets.
Because the incidence of adenocarcinoma is rapidly increasing in North America, an increased emphasis on the study of its molecular biology would
certainly be appropriate. The funding agencies may
have recognized this alarming situation but funds are
not set aside to study adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. It may be important to spend more resources
now to curb the rising incidence than to spend con-

1307

siderably larger resources when the burden is much
higher on our society.
With regard to the current empiric paradigm for
designing phase 2 clinical trials, we are most likely at
a juncture in which traditional phase 2 trial designs
are not likely to produce an advantage. Novel
approaches could include marker-based therapy
(examples could be antiapoptotic agents or antiepidermal growth factor receptor agents), therapies targeting specific targets uncovered by molecular
biology studies (for example, the NF-jB pathway or
sonic hedgehog), or avoiding certain therapies altogether because the patient’s genetic profile suggests
that excessive toxicity (including radiation pneumonitis) is highly likely. In addition, the primary endpoint can be based on pathologic response rather
than traditional DFS or OS. Changing the primary
endpoint to pathologic response (which is a surrogate for long-term outcome) could produce reliable
results much faster than previous trials have. In addition, reliance on imaging and observing changes in
the target tissue (biomarkers) early during the therapy would produce much-needed knowledge to help
individualize therapy in the future and also help
select those drugs for further development on the
fast track.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
have demonstrated that neither the addition of IC
nor type of cytotoxic agents used improves post-therapy pathologic response, OS, or DFS in patients with
LEC who are undergoing preoperative therapy.
