BACKGROUND. The incidence and pattern of brain metastases was analyzed
among patients who achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC).

METHODS. Between 1990 and 2004, 211 patients were treated with neoadjuvant
therapy before surgical resection for stage III NSCLC. The clinical course of 51

pproximately 50% of patients with locally advanced nonsmallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) will develop brain metastasis at some
time during the course of their disease.1–3 This is the first site of recurrence in 15% to 40% of these patients, and autopsy studies have
demonstrated that a substantial proportion of those who die of intrathoracic or extracranial disease progression from NSCLC also
have synchronous brain metastasis.3–6 Several authors have therefore suggested that with improvements in overall survival and localregional control from effective multimodality regimens incorporat-

ing chemotherapy with radiation and/or surgery the
incidence and relative importance of brain metastases among patients with locally advanced NSCLC has
visibly increased.6–9 This naturally raises the question
of whether aggressive follow-up strategies, incorporating serial head imaging with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and/or prophylactic cranial irradiation
(PCI) to detect, prevent, and/or treat brain metastasis
among asymptomatic patients after completion of
local-regional therapy are warranted. Although randomized studies have failed to establish a survival
benefit for PCI, subset analysis was not performed
and it remains possible that selected patients, particularly those without evidence of disease at the primary or other extracranial sites, may significantly
benefit from the prevention of brain metastasis.10–13
Likewise, some studies have suggested that early
detection of brain metastasis from NSCLC and
prompt treatment with SRS can significantly improve
survival, particularly among those without evidence
of extracranial disease.14,15
Whereas the optimal local-regional treatment
approach for locally advanced NSCLC is uncertain,
the integration of surgery as a component of multimodality therapy may enable the identification of a
subset of patients, those with a pathological complete
response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy, who may be at high risk for the
subsequent development of brain metastases. The
purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the outcome
of these patients, focusing on the incidence and temporal presentation of intracranial metastases, to assess
potential strategies for the management of the brain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was formally approved by the Committee
on Human Research at the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) before collection of all patient
information. Between January 1990 and December
2004, 211 patients underwent definitive surgical
resection after neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for biopsy-proven,
clinical stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC. The medical
records of 51 patients who exhibited a pCR, defined
as having no evidence of residual tumor at the primary site or regional lymph nodes, at the time of
surgery were reviewed to determine the clinical
course and subsequent patterns of failure. The
neoadjuvant regimen consisted of chemotherapy
alone in 29 patients and chemoradiotherapy in 22
patients. No patient had a history of prior malignancy or cranial irradiation.

1669

All patients were retrospectively staged in accordance with 2002 American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) guidelines using disease characteristics at the time of diagnosis. All patients underwent
computed tomography (CT) of the chest and upper
abdomen. Forty-five (88%) patients underwent mediastinoscopy, and 18 (35%) patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) as part of the
initial staging work-up. Forty-four (86%) patients
and 20 (39%) patients had a CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, respectively,
before therapy.

Treatment
The chemotherapy agents used varied depending on
the time period of this study as well as the discretion
of the treating physicians. Chemotherapy was
platinum-based in all patients. The most common
regimens were cisplatin/etoposide (18 patients), carboplatin/taxol (13 patients), and carboplatin/etoposide
(5 patients). The median number of chemotherapy
cycles administered before surgery for those treated
without radiation was 3 (range, 2–8). For those treated
with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy the median
number of chemotherapy cycles was 2 (range, 2–4).
Radiation was delivered using megavoltage equipment with once-daily, conventional fractionation.
The median dose was 4500 cGy (range, 4200–7000
cGy). The planning target volume (PTV) was based
primarily on the gross tumor extent as determined
by CT. Three-dimensional (3D) planning was performed in 46 (90%) patients. For patients treated
without 3D planning, target volumes were designed
based on plain films taken at the time of fluoroscopy
and were generally AP/PA with laterals with dose
prescribed to midplane.
All patients were clinically reassessed approximately 2 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The decision for surgical resection was typically
made by a multidisciplinary tumor board after
reviewing pre- and postneoadjuvant therapy CT
images with consideration given to the patient’s performance status and medical condition. Clinical
response after neoadjuvant therapy was partial
(greater than 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions) in 39 (76%) patients, and stable (<50%
reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions) in the
remaining 12 (24%) patients. No patient had a clinical complete response (disappearance of all measurable tumor) or progressive disease.

The median time from completion of neoadjuvant therapy to definitive surgery was 28 days (range,
15–60 days). The type of procedure was dependent
on the primary site, extent of disease, medical considerations, and the discretion of the surgeon. Pulmonary function tests were performed for all
patients before surgery. In general, an attempt was
made to maximize local control with preservation of
functional outcome. Surgical resection encompassed
the tumor extent at the time of operation rather than
the preneoadjuvant therapy volume at the time of
initial diagnosis. The surgical procedure consisted of
lobectomy (30 patients), bilobectomy (14 patients),
or pneumonectomy (7 patients). The number of
lymph nodes sampled ranged from 4 to 36 (median,
16). Thirty-three (65%) patients received platinumbased chemotherapy postoperatively. None of the
patients received postoperative radiation therapy or
prophylactic brain irradiation (PCI).
Follow-up imaging consisted of CT of the thorax
with or without PET scan. Imaging of the head with
CT and/or MRI was performed at the discretion of
the physician but in general was not routinely performed in the absence of symptoms. Median followup was 37 months (range, 3–85 months) for the
entire population and 53 months among surviving
patients (range, 12–85 months). None of the patients
suffered early death without progression of NSCLC.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint analyzed was brain metastasis-free survival. Both the initial site of recurrence
and all subsequent sites of recurrence were documented. Patients who died without evidence of brain
metastasis were censored at their time of death in
the analysis of brain recurrences. Secondary endpoints analyzed included overall survival and localregional control. All endpoints were measured from
the first day of treatment for all patients until death
or date of last contact if still alive. One-, 3-, and 5year estimates of survival were calculated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons between
subsets performed with 2-sided log-rank tests.16 All
tests were 2-tailed, with a P-value <.05 considered
significant.

Sixteen of the 51 patients with a pCR were alive
at the time of analysis. Median survival for the entire
patient population was 43 months. As illustrated in
Figure 1, the overall survivals at 1, 3, and 5 years
were 82%, 63%, and 42%, respectively. Thirty-one
(61%) patients developed recurrent disease. Sites of
initial failure included brain (22 patients), local-regional (5 patients), bone (3 patients), and liver (1
patient). Among the 22 patients with brain metastases as the site of initial recurrence, 2 subsequently
experienced local-regional recurrences and an additional 2 developed bone metastases. The 5-year estimate of local-regional control was 86%.
A total of 28 patients (55%) developed brain metastases at some time during the course of follow-up.

Twenty-one of the 28 patients with brain metastases from NSCLC had died at the time of analysis,

including 17 of 22 with brain metastases as the site
of first recurrence. Median survival from the time of
brain metastasis was 10 months for isolated recurrences and 5 months for nonisolated cases. Treatment strategies included whole brain radiotherapy
(27 patients), radiosurgery (7 patients), and surgical
resection (4 patients). Some patients were treated
with more than 1 modality for their brain metastases.
Cause of death was assessable for 19 of 21 patients
who died after developing brain metastases, including 17 of 17 patients with brain metastases as the
site of initial recurrence. Overall, 88% (15 of 17) of
patients with brain metastases as the site of initial
recurrence died as a result of cranial disease, and at
least 76% (16 of 21) of all patients who developed
brain metastases died from neurological sequelae.
Among the 21 patients who died of brain metastases, 15 (71%) had no evidence of disease at extracranial sites.

DISCUSSION
The results of the present study not only confirm
previous reports that patients with locally advanced
NSCLC are at high risk for the development of brain
metastases but also identifies a specific subset of
patients who may derive particular benefit from aggressive management strategies to address this issue
after completing local-regional therapy.1–6 Patients
who achieve a pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced
NSCLC have a risk of death from brain metastases
that exceeds potential mortality due to extracranial
disease progression. Similar to others, we found that
this risk was more elevated in patients with nonsquamous cell types compared with those with
squamous histology.17–19 Because the majority of
patients who developed brain metastases in the
present series died from their cranial disease and
even more had neurological symptoms at their
onset, we contend that vigilant surveillance incorporating serial brain MRI with SRS as needed or,
alternatively, the judicious use of PCI may improve
overall survival and quality of life among those who
achieve a pCR after neoadjuvant therapy for locally
advanced NSCLC.
It has been consistently reported that patients
with a pCR after neoadjuvant therapy for locally
advanced NSCLC have an improved prognosis.20–22
Our results are in accord with previous reports suggesting that the relative significance of brain metastases becomes more appreciable with improvements
in local-regional control and survival for those with
NSCLC.6–9 Tang et al.23 also showed that patients

whose lungs showed a complete response to treatment had a significantly higher rate of developing
brain recurrences than nonresponders (78% versus
8%). It has long been argued that as control of extracranial disease improves for patients with NSCLC,
prevention and treatment of brain metastases assumes an increasingly important role because the
blood-brain barrier provides sanctuary from the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cox et al.7 reviewed 4
prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) trials and concluded that the addition of
chemotherapy to definitive radiation dramatically
increased the incidence of brain metastases in
patients treated for locally advanced NSCLC.
The most important observation from this study
is the striking impact that cerebral metastases had
on morbidity and mortality, which we believe can be
attributed to the lack of follow-up screening and/or
prevention strategies for brain metastases after completion of local-regional therapy. In particular, it is
likely that earlier detection of cranial lesions with
routine MRI, followed by SRS in selected patients,
has the potential to significantly improve outcome in
this setting.24–27 For patients who are not candidates
for surveillance due to medical or social reasons, PCI
may be a feasible alternative.
Although 3 randomized trials of PCI for locally
advanced NSCLC have failed to demonstrate improved survival, irradiation significantly reduced the
rate of developing brain metastasis.10–12 However,
these results have been criticized because of patient
heterogeneity and for possible imbalances in stratification according to established prognostic variables.
It is unknown to what extent the development of
local-regional failure or extracranial disease progression may have obscured any potential benefits that
PCI may have conferred. Moreover, methods of
local-regional treatment differed greatly from current multimodality approaches and only a small
minority underwent surgery as a component of definitive therapy. For instance, the vast majority of
patients enrolled on trials conducted by the Veterans Administration and the RTOG were considered
unresectable and treated with radiation alone, leading some to suggest that death from extracranial
processes may have overwhelmed any apparent
benefit from PCI. A recent analysis of prospective
data from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)
found that 39% of all brain metastasis from locally
advanced NSCLC occurred after 6 months from
starting treatment.17
Other series have also suggested that PCI may be
beneficial in select patients with locally advanced
NSCLC in which extracranial disease is controlled.

Cerebral Metastases After Therapy for NSCLC/Chen et al.

Mamon et al.2 reported on 177 patients treated with
neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. Whereas the localregional control rate was an impressive 86%, it was
notable that 40% of patients developed brain metastases at some point during follow-up. Additional
analysis reveled that 34% of patients recurred in the
brain as the first site of failure, which was associated
with a 4-fold increase in death. Stuschke et al.1 compared the outcomes of 47 patients treated with PCI
to 28 patients who did not receive PCI after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy
and surgery. The authors found that PCI significantly
reduced the rate of brain metastases as the first site
of recurrence from 30% to 8% at 4 years and that of
overall brain recurrence from 54% to 13%. Notably,
among patients with a complete or partial response
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, PCI reduced the rate
of death by 50%, suggesting that patients displaying
a favorable response to therapy may derive the most
benefit from PCI. The weakness of these studies,
similar to the present series, was that head imaging
was neither routinely performed at diagnosis nor
during follow-up in the absence of neurological
symptoms. Furthermore, the majority of patients underwent imaging using CT, which is known to be
much less sensitive than MRI for detecting early
brain metastases.
It is important to recognize that the overwhelming majority of patients in the present series who
developed central nervous system metastasis died
from their brain involvement. Only 4 of 22 patients
who developed brain metastases as the site of first
recurrence subsequently developed extracranial disease, suggesting that the aggressive screening and
treatment of brain metastases, as well as possibly
prevention, has the real potential to improve survival.
Wronski et al.28 similarly analyzed 231 patients with
brain metastases from NSCLC, many of who did not
have control of the primary site, and showed that
neurological sequelae contributed to cause of death
in approximately two-thirds of cases. Our finding
that most patients with brain metastases from
NSCLC presented with multiple parenchymal lesions
at the time of recurrence, in the absence of screening, has also been reported by others. In the series
by Stuske et al.1 only 1 of 8 patients who developed
isolated brain metastasis after not receiving PCI presented with a single metastasis at initial recurrence,
with most having 4 or more lesions. Nussbaum
et al.29 also reported that less than 50% of patients
have fewer than 4 metastasis at the time of initial
brain recurrence.
Based on our current experience, the sensitivity
of MRI to detect brain metastases among asymptom-

1673

atic patients, and the effectiveness of SRS in treating
the majority of these lesions, we recommend serial
brain MRI every 3 months for patients who achieve a
pCR after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced
NSCLC. Given its minimally invasive nature and its
tolerability with respect to neurotoxicity, SRS appears
preferable to PCI, although prospective data are lacking. Until the results of ongoing studies attempting
to correlate molecular biomarkers and gene products
with clinical outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced NSCLC become
applicable, it appears feasible to use pCR as a means
of identifying patients who have a low enough risk of
extracranial disease recurrence to benefit from vigilant surveillance or PCI.30–32 The fact that 7 of 51 of
patients experienced local-regional failure and an
additional 6 of 51 had extracranial distant failure after
pCR, however, suggests that pCR is neither a surrogate for complete remission nor an entirely accurate
predictor of disease response to therapy.
The primary limitation of this study was that due
to its retrospective nature—we were unable to evaluate the outcomes of all 211 patients treated surgically
after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced
NSCLC regardless of pathological response status
and thus are unable to determine whether the incidence of brain metastasis represented an increase
relative to patients who did not attain pCR. Indeed,
it is likely that certain subgroups among those who
did not have pCR to neoadjuvant therapy may also
derive benefit from aggressive surveillance or PCI.
Similarly, due to the heterogeneity of our patient
population with respect to pretreatment staging,
neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy vs chemoradiotherapy), chemotherapeutic regimens, and posttreatment follow-up, we acknowledge that our data
need to be validated through multi-institutional trials
in which patient evaluation and treatment is more
standardized. However, based on the results of a
recently published review of 422 prospectively treated patients from the SWOG database, in which all
subjects were required to have brain imaging before
treatment for stage III NSCLC, it is unlikely that our
conclusion would have been significantly altered.17
For instance, in the SWOG review, 27% of patients
developed brain metastasis at any point after definitive treatment. Although data reporting the rates of
brain metastasis and neurological sequelae according
to response at the primary lung site are lacking, and
therefore preclude any formal comparison among
those with a pCR and non-pCR, our results clearly
demonstrate that surgically treated patients who
attain a pCR after neoadjuvant therapy for locally
advanced NSCLC are at high risk for developing cere-

bral metastasis and should be strongly considered
for strategies for the subsequent management of the
brain.
Our findings, subject to the limitations discussed
above, suggest that it may be justifiable to aggressively screen for brain metastasis, or alternatively to
consider PCI after multimodality treatment for
locally advanced NSCLC when the primary tumor is
controlled and there is no evidence of systemic disease, because these patients, especially if they have
tumors of nonsquamous histology, are at ostensibly
high risk for the development of brain metastases.
This is particularly relevant because with the advent
of newer chemotherapy agents and more efficacious
neoadjuvant regimens, the rate of pCR will continue
to increase. Additional studies, including the ongoing
trial by the RTOG that notably includes any patient
with clinical evidence of local-regional control after
therapy, could further refine patient selection for PCI
in the future.
