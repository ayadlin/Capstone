Abstract
The fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene is significantly up-regulated
in various types of cancers, and blocking the FAS expression
results in apoptosis of tumor cells. Therefore, FAS is
considered to be an attractive target for anticancer therapy.
However, the molecular mechanism by which the FAS gene is
up-regulated in tumor cells is poorly understood. We found
that FAS was significantly up-regulated by hypoxia, which was
also accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation
in human breast cancer cell lines. The FAS expression was also
activated by H2O2, whereas N-acetyl-L-cystein, a ROS inhibitor,
suppressed the expression. We also found that the hypoxia
significantly up-regulated sterol regulatory–element binding
protein (SREBP)-1, the major transcriptional regulator of the
FAS gene, via phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). Moreover, our results of
reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
indicate that SREBP-1 strongly bound to the SREBP binding
site/E-box sequence on the FAS promoter under hypoxia. In
our xenograft mouse model, FAS was strongly expressed in the
hypoxic regions of the tumor. In addition, our results of
immunohistochemical analysis for human breast tumor specimens indicate that the expressions of both FAS and SREBP-1
were colocalized with hypoxic regions in the tumors. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance to cyclophosphamide was partially blocked by a combination of FAS
inhibitor and cyclophosphamide. Taken together, our results
indicate that FAS gene is up-regulated by hypoxia via activation
of the Akt and HIF1 followed by the induction of the SREBP-1
gene, and that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is partly due
to the up-regulation of FAS. [Cancer Res 2008;68(4):1003–11]

Introduction
Fatty acids have long chains of lipid-carboxylic acid and play
pivotal roles in normal cellular function as well as in homeostasis
of the whole body. They are the source of membrane components,
such as phospholipids and glycolipids, and also provide precursors
of critical signal molecules for proliferation and differentiation (1).
Fatty acids also function as a medium to store energy in the
adipose tissue (2). In general, normal adult cells acquire fatty acid
mainly from dietary source and rarely use the pathway of de novo

synthesis, except in the liver, adipose tissue, and lactating
mammary gland (3, 4). In striking contrast, many human tumor
cells synthesize fatty acids by using the de novo pathway as was
originally observed by Medes et al. (5) >50 years ago. Fatty acid
synthase (FAS) is the major enzyme of lipogenesis and catalyzes the
condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to produce palmitic
acid in the presence of NADPH (6). The FAS gene is highly upregulated in various types of human malignancies, although this
gene is expressed at minimum or undetectable level in most
normal tissues, and therefore, FAS overexpression is considered to
be one of the most common molecular changes in cancer cells
(7–11). Importantly, treatment of tumor cells with pharmacologic
inhibitors of FAS leads to cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis
of the tumor cells (12). We have previously shown that specific
blocking of the FAS expression by using siRNA in breast cancer
cells caused an accumulation of malonyl-CoA, which led to the
inhibition of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 as well as upregulation of ceramide (13). This was also followed by the
induction of the proapoptotic genes, BNIP3, TRAIL, and DAP
kinase 2, which resulted in the apoptosis of the tumor cells (13).
These observations suggest that FAS overexpression confers
selective advantage to tumor cells by inhibiting apoptosis and
promoting cell cycle progression.
How the FAS gene is up-regulated in cancer cells is an intriguing
question, although it has been poorly understood. FAS was
previously found to be up-regulated by several growth factors
and their receptors including epidermal growth factor, Her2
(ErbB2/neu), and keratinocyte growth factor (14–16). Upon binding
to each receptor, these factors transmit cellular signals such as
mitogen-activated protein kinases (Erk1/2 MAPK2), Janus kinase
(JNK), and phosphotidylinositol 3¶-kinase (PI3K) followed by Akt
activation (17–20). The activation of Akt is commonly observed in a
variety of tumors and seems to contribute to the up-regulation of
the lipogenic enzymes. On the other hand, a lack of expression or
mutation of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, has been well
established in various types of tumors, and PTEN blocks the
function of Akt by counteracting PI3K through dephosphorylation
of this enzyme (21). In fact, we have recently shown that the
expression of PTEN has a significant inverse correlation with FAS
expression in prostate cancer patients (22), and that the inhibition of the PTEN gene expression in vitro indeed led to the
overexpression of FAS, although ectopic expression of PTEN
significantly suppressed FAS (22). On the other hand, sterol
regulatory–element binding protein (SREBP) have been known to
be the key transcription factors to regulate lipogenic genes, and
the FAS gene was indeed shown to be significantly activated by
SREBP-1. Interestingly, Porstmann et al. (20) recently found that
Akt stimulated the synthesis and nuclear localization of activated

SREBP-1 followed by activation of the FAS gene. Therefore, PTENAkt pathway and the downstream effectors play a critical role in
the FAS gene regulation in cancer cells. Furthermore, FAS
expression has also been found to be controlled by tumor
suppressors and oncogenes, including p53, p63, p73, and H-ras
(18, 23). Therefore, overexpression of FAS is often associated with
phenotypic changes of cell transformation that are induced either
by oncogenes or tumor suppressors. These observations strongly
suggest that FAS overexpression is actively contributing to the
process of cell transformation rather than merely a consequence
accompanied with the phenotypic changes.
Because FAS alone is not likely to cause cellular transformation
but rather provides growth advantage to tumor cells by blocking
proapoptotic genes, it is plausible that the FAS gene is up-regulated
by tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, a hallmark of tumors,
as a survival strategy of tumor cells. This assumption is supported
by the observation that the Akt pathway is activated by a hypoxic
condition, and that Akt is also capable of activating SREBP-1, which
is a key transcription factor of the FAS gene. In this article, we tested
a possibility of regulation of FAS expression by hypoxia in breast
tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo and found that the FAS gene is
indeed up-regulated by hypoxia through induction of Akt followed
by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) and SREBP-1. We
also found that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, which is a major
clinical obstacle, can be partially overcome by a combination of a
FAS inhibitor and a chemotherapeutic drug.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Human breast carcinoma cell lines, MX1,
MCF7, MDA-MB231, and MDA-MB157 were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS, streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL), and
250 nmol/L dexamethasone (Sigma Chemical Co.) and grown at 37jC in a
5% CO2 atmosphere. The culture medium was replaced with DMEM before
hypoxia treatment at 37jC in GasPak (BD Diagnostic Systems). Hydrogen
peroxide, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), cerulenin, YC-1, and cyclophosphamide
were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. LY294002 was obtained from
Calbiochem. The expression plasmid of Akt1, Addgene plasmid 9008, which
expressed activated (myristoylated) form of Akt1, was purchased from
Addgene (24). siRNA for Akt and scramble sequence for control were
obtained from Cell Signaling. siRNA for siSREBP was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology.
Western blot. The cells were collected and resuspended in lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate,
150 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 mmol/L EDTA]. The lysates were boiled for 5 min,
resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto
nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were treated with antibodies
against FAS (0.2 Ag/mL; Immuno-biological Laboratories Co.), h-tubulin
(1:1,000; Upstate Biotechnology), HIF1 (1:200; BD Bioscience), SREBP-1
(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Akt (1:200; Ser 473; Cell
Signaling), Akt (1:200; Cell Signaling), and phospho-SREBP (0.5 Ag/mL;
ref. 25). The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by ECL Plus system
(Amersham Life Sciences).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from the cells
and reverse transcribed. The cDNA was then amplified with a pair of forward and reverse primers for the following genes: FAS (5¶-CATCCAGATAGGCCTCATAGAC-3¶ and 5¶-CTCCATGAAGTAGGAGTGGAAG-3¶), SREBP
(5¶-CTGGTCTACCATAAGCTGCAC-3¶ and 5¶-GACTGGTCTTCACTCTCAATG-3¶), and h-actin (5¶-TGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCCATG-3¶ and
5¶-CGTAGATGGGCACAGTGTGGGTG-3¶). PCR reactions were performed
using DNA engine opticon2 system (MJ Research) and the Dynamo SYBR
Green qPCR kit (Finnzyme Corp.). The thermal cycling conditions composed

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

of an initial denaturation step at 95jC for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of PCR
using the following profile: 94jC, 30 s; 63jC, 30 s; and 72jC, 30 s.
Reactive oxygen species assay. The cells were cultured in RPMI
medium and fluorophore dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA;
Sigma Chemical Co.) was added directly to the medium at a final
concentration of 50 Amol/L. The culture was further incubated at 37jC for
1 h, and the cells were washed with PBS. The stained cells were visualized
under fluorescent microscope and photographed. The amount of staining
was quantified by the MCID software.
Reporter assay. To generate the reporter plasmid for chloramphenicol
acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter assay, the promoter region of FAS ( from +4
to 1,328 bp) was amplified where the forward primer included the Hind III
linker and reverse primers included Bgl II linker. The PCR products were
cloned into the pBLCAT3 plasmid. A series of deletions were constructed by
Erase-a-Base System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
These plasmids were transfected to breast cancer cell line MCF7 by using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
After 48 h, the cells were collected and then subjected to CAT assay as
described previously (26). The reaction was done, and acetylated [14C]Chloramphenicol was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Packard Instruments).
The luciferase reporter plasmid of the FAS promoter was a gift from
Dr. Verhoeven (Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; ref. 27). To
delete eight bases of the SREBP binding/E-Box sequence on the FAS promoter
from this plasmid, QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene)
was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The luciferase reporter
plasmids were transfected to MCF7 as described above. Luciferase activities
were then measured by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) and Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). For each
transformation experiment, the Renilla expression plasmid phRG-TK
(Promega) was cotransfected as an internal control, and promoter activities
were normalized accordingly.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. MCF7 cells were cultured in T75
flask and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. To
stop the reaction, 125 mmol/L glycine was added to the culture medium,
and the cells were washed with PBS and harvested. Cells were then
suspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mmol/L PIPE, 85 mmol/L KCl, and 0.5%
NP40) and homogenized with a type A Dounce homogenizer. The cell nuclei
were collected and lysed with Nuclei lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10
mmol/L EDTA, and 1% SDS). The chromatin was sonicated on ice to an
average length of 400 bp. The sample was then centrifuged at 4jC, and the
precipitates were resuspended in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
dilution buffer (16.7 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 167 mmol/L NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100,
and 0.01% SDS). After preclearing the sample with Protein G agarose beads
(Dynal Biotech) followed by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was
transferred to a new tube and anti–SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
antibody was added. After 24 h of incubation at 4jC, Protein G agarose
beads were added, and the sample was incubated for 3 h at 4jC. The beads
were then washed with washing buffer (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 500 mmol/L
LiCl, 1% NP40, and 1% deoxycholic acid), and DNA-protein complexes were
eluted with elution buffer (100 mmol/L NaHCO3 and 1% SDS). DNA protein
was decrosslinked followed by phenol extraction, and the purified DNA was
subjected to PCR using both specific (5¶-TCATTGGCCTGGGCGGCGCAG-3¶
and 5¶-AAACCGCGGCCATCCCCGGGC-3¶) and nonspecific primers (5¶-CAGCCAGAGACACCTGTGGCC-3¶ and 5¶-CCTTTTCTGACCGCTTCGCGC-3¶) for
the SREBP binding/E-box sequence of the FAS promoter. The PCR products
were visualized after electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gel followed by
staining with ethidium bromide.
Immunohistochemistry. Human breast cancer specimens were obtained
from surgical pathology archives of the Akita Red Cross Hospital. All of the
tissue sections were obtained by surgical resection. For immunohistochemical staining, 4-Am-thick sections were cut out from the formaldehyde-fixed
and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens and mounted on charged glass
slides. The sections were baked at 60jC for 1 h, deparaffinized by two changes
of xylene, and rehydrated in graded alcohol solutions. For antigen retrieval,
the sections were heated in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 85jC for
30 min. The slides were treated with 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase
activity and then incubated overnight at 4jC with anti-FAS rabbit polyclonal

antibody (0.2 Ag/mL; Immuno-biological Laboratories Co.), anti–SREBP-1
rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti–
carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100; R&D
Systems, Inc.). The sections were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG for 30 min at room temperature,
and 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine substrate chromogen solution [Envision-plus kit
(Dako Corp.) or ABC staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)] was
applied. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Results of
the immunohistochemistry were judged based on the intensity of staining,
comparing the tumor cells and the normal glands on the same slide. Grading
of the FAS, SREBP-1, and CA9 expression levels was done by two independent
persons without prior knowledge of the patient data. The cases were then
divided into those that showed positive staining and those that showed
reduced expression of the two genes.
Animal model. Breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231, was suspended to
30 million/mL with PBS, and equal volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was
mixed with the tissue. The cell suspension (0.1 mL) was injected into the
mammary fat pad of 4-week-old female nude mice. A disc of 17B-estradiol
(Invitrogen) was also embedded under the skin of these mice. After 3 weeks,
0.2 mL of pimonidazole (Hypoxyprove-1 kit; Chemicon; 2,000 Ag/mL)
was injected to the mouse via i.p. After 2 h of the injection, the mouse was
euthanized and the tumor excised and snap frozen. The tumor sample was

cut into a 4-Am slice and mounted on charged glass slides. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed for these slices using anti-pimonidazole and anti-FAS antibodies.
In situ apoptosis assay. The cells were grown in 96-well plates and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by permeabilization with 0.2%
Triton-X 100/0.1% sodium citrate at 4jC. The cells were then washed
extensively and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin end labeling assay was performed using the In Situ Cell Death
Detection kit/TMR Red (Roche Applied Science). The reaction was stopped
after 1 h, and the number of apoptotic cells in each well was counted under
a confocal microscope.
FAS enzyme assay. The enzyme activity of FAS was assayed as described
previously (28). Briefly, the cells were grown in 12-well plates with or
without cyclophosphamide and cerulenin. After 24 h, the cells were
collected and resuspended with 0.25 mol/L Sucrose buffer (0.25 mol/L
sucrose, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and 1 mmol/L DTT), and the
cells were then homogenized by a type A Dounce homogenizer. FAS activity
was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring oxidation of NADPH
(Sigma). Fifty microliters of the cell extract were added to a 500 AL reaction
mixture containing 0.1 mol/L K2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 0.3 mmol/L NADPH, and
0.05 mmol/L Acetyl-CoA, and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored
for 3 min to measure background of NADPH oxidation. Malonyl-CoA

Figure 1. Hypoxia significantly augments the expression of FAS. A, human breast cancer cell lines, MX1, MCF7, and MDA-MB157 were cultured in three sets of
24-well plates under normoxic (N) or hypoxic (H ) conditions for 48 h. One set of cells (in triplicate) was collected, and RNA was prepared. The samples were then
subjected to qRT-PCR using primers for the FAS and h-actin genes. Another set of cells was collected, and the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis
using anti-FAS and antitubulin antibodies (inset ). B, the last set of plates was used for assaying the amount of ROS using DCFDA dye. The cells were treated
with the dye for 1 h followed by washing the wells with PBS. The stained cells were visualized under fluorescent microscope and photographed. The amount of staining
was quantified by using a MCID software.

Figure 2. ROS induces FAS expression. A, breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB157, which has a low level of
ROS, was cultured in triplicate in 24-well plates and was
treated with various amounts of H2O2 for 24 h (left ) or
with 1 mmol/L H2O2 for the indicated time period (right ).
B, cells were then collected and subjected to qRT-PCR
and Western blot for the FAS gene expression. Similarly,
MCF7 and MDA-MB231 were treated with or without
1 mmol/L H2O2 for 24 h followed by qRT-PCR for the FAS
gene expression. C, the MX1 cell line, which has a high
level of ROS, was cultured and treated with NAC
(ROS scavenger) for 24 h. The cells were then collected
and subjected to qRT-PCR as well as Western blot
analyses (first panel ). Another set of plates with MX1
cells was treated with 20 mmol/L of NAC and assayed
for the amount of ROS (second panel ). Numbers
of apoptotic cells of MX1 in the presence of NAC
(20 mmol/L) or cerulenin (10 Ag/mL) were measured by
using TMR apoptosis assay kit (third panel ). MX1 cells
were cultured in three sets of 24-well plates under
normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 48 h in the presence or
absence of NAC (20 mmol/L). The cells were then
subjected to qRT-PCR and Western blot to measure the
FAS expression (last panel ).

(0.2 mmol/L) was then added to the reaction mixture, and absorbance at
340 nm was again monitored for 3 min to measure FAS activity.
Statistical analysis. For in vitro experiments, one way ANOVA was used
to calculate the P values. Descriptive statistics comparing the expression of
FAS, SREBP-1, and CA9 were analyzed by standard m2 test. For all of the
statistical tests, the significance was defined as having a P value of <0.05.
In all cases, SPSS software was used.

Results
Hypoxia induces the expression of the FAS gene via reactive
oxygen species. To examine the effect of hypoxia on the
expression of the FAS gene, we cultured three breast cancer cell
lines, MX1, MCF7, and MDA-MB157, under normoxic or hypoxic
conditions. The RNA and cell lysates were prepared from these
samples, and the level of FAS expression was measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western
blot. As shown in Fig. 1, our results indicate that the transcription
of the FAS gene was significantly increased in hypoxia compared
with that in normoxia (Fig. 1A). Protein level of FAS was also
strongly increased in hypoxic condition (Fig. 1A, inset), although
the amount of FAS induced in these three cell lines at protein level

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

(7.1-, 4.5-, and 3.0-fold, respectively) seems to be less than that at
RNA level (8.7-, 4.6-, and 2.7-fold, respectively). These apparent
differences may be due to the instability of the mRNA or the FAS
protein. We also examined the amount of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in these cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and
found that hypoxia significantly augmented the generation of ROS
in all these cell lines (Fig. 1B), which is in good agreement with
previous reports (29). These results suggest that the expression
of the FAS gene is positively controlled by hypoxia, which is also
associated with the amount of ROS in the cell. To further
corroborate our results, we tested the effect of H2O2 on the FAS
expression in MDA-MB157, which displayed the lowest level of FAS.
As shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of H2O2 in the culture medium
significantly augmented the expression of FAS at both RNA and
protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Other cell
lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB231, also showed a similar trend and
increased the FAS expression by 3- to 4-fold in response to H2O2
(Fig. 2B). On the other hand, addition of an ROS scavenger, NAC,
significantly suppressed the expression of the FAS gene as well as
ROS production in MX1, which showed the highest level of FAS
expression among the tested cell lines (Fig. 2C, first and second

Figure 3. Hypoxia-induced FAS expression is mediated via Akt, HIF1, and SREBP-1. A, MCF7 cells were cultured in 24-well plates under hypoxia or normoxia
conditions for 48 h and with or without H2O2 for 24 h. Cells were then collected and subjected to Western blot analyses using antibodies for FAS, HIF1, phospho-SREBP
(p-SREBP ), SREBP-1, phospho-Akt (p-Akt), total Akt (Akt ), and Tubulin (left). The MCF7 cells were also cultured in the presence or absence of YC-1 (HIF1 inhibitor)
under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 48 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analyses for HIF1 and FAS expression (right ). B, MCF7 cells cultured
under normoxia or hypoxia with or without the treatment of LY294002 were subjected to qRT-PCR to quantify the expression of the FAS and SREBP genes
(first and second panels ). Another set of culture with the same treatment was also subjected to Western blot analysis (third panel ). siRNA for Akt1 and SREBP-1, or the
expression plasmid of active form of Akt1 were transfected to MCF7 cells. The cells were then incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 48 h. The cells
were collected and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for FAS expression (fourth panel ). C, CAT reporter constructs with various lengths of the FAS promoter were
transfected to MCF7, and the cells were continued to be cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 48 h and with or without H2O2 for 24 h. Cells were then
collected, and the cell lysates were subjected to CAT assay (left ). The luciferase reporter plasmid with 195 bases of FAS promoter with or without deletion of E-box was
transfected to MCF7, and the cells were cultured under hypoxia or normoxia for 48 h and with or without H2O2 for 24 h. Cells were then collected and assayed for
luciferase activities (right ). D, for ChIP assay, MCF7 cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. The cells were lysed and the lysate was pulled down
with anti–SREBP-1 antibody. The DNA was then subjected to quantitative PCR using nonspecific (NS ) or SREBP binding site–specific primers (S). The ratio of the
DNA was calculated based on cyclic threshold value for each reaction.

panels). Because inhibition of the FAS expression has been known
to cause apoptosis (13), we also examined the effect of NAC on cell
death. As shown in Fig. 2C (third panel), the treatment of the cell
with NAC significantly induced apoptosis to the similar level as it
was when treated with a specific inhibitor of FAS, cerulenin. To
further confirm our results, we tested the effect of NAC on the
FAS up-regulation under hypoxia and found that NAC indeed
significantly blocked the up-regulation of FAS (Fig. 2C, fourth
panel). Collectively, these results suggest that the expression of the
FAS gene is up-regulated by hypoxia through the generation of ROS.
Hypoxia up-regulates the FAS gene expression through
SREBP-1. To understand the mechanism of the hypoxia-induced
expression of the FAS gene, we first examined the status of HIF1,
SREBP, and Akt under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. HIF1 has
been known as a key transcriptional regulator induced by hypoxia
(30). SREBP is the major transcription factor of the FAS gene and
has been known to be up-regulated under hypoxia (31). In fission
yeast, SREBP was indeed found to function as an oxygen sensor
(32). Akt is a key signal molecule for cell survival, and apoptosis
and has been shown to be up-regulated under hypoxia (33). As
shown in Fig. 3A (left), our results of Western blot analysis indicate
that expressions of FAS, HIF1, SREBP-1, and phospho-SREBP
(T426) were indeed up-regulated under hypoxia as well as in the
presence of H2O2 in MCF7 cells. We also found that Akt was
strongly phosphorylated at Ser435 in the same set of samples
treated with hypoxia or H2O2, although the amount of total Akt was
somewhat decreased, suggesting that PI3K/Akt pathway and
SREBP-1 are involved in the activation of FAS by hypoxia and
ROS (Fig. 3A, left). Because HIF1 was also up-regulated by hypoxia
and H2O2, we next examined whether HIF1 was involved in the
activation of FAS by adding a HIF1 inhibitor, YC-1, in the cultured
cells under hypoxic condition. As shown in Fig. 3A (right), the
hypoxic condition strongly up-regulated HIF1, and this upregulation was blocked by YC-1. Interestingly, the YC-1 treatment
also blocked the expression of FAS as well as phospho-SREBP-1,
suggesting that HIF1 is also involved in the up-regulation of FAS

and SREBP-1. The results of qRT-PCR analysis also indicate that
FAS and SREBP-1 were significantly increased by the treatment of
hypoxia (Fig. 3B, first and second panels). Furthermore, the results
of both of our qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses indicate that the
up-regulation of FAS, p-Akt, HIF1, and SREBP-1, as well as p-SREBP,
were blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 3B, first, second , and third panels),
suggesting that the induction of the FAS expression by hypoxia is
mediated through activation of Akt followed by up-regulation of
HIF1 and SREBP-1. To further verify our results, we tested the effect
of siRNA specific to SREBP-1 and Akt as well as the effect of ectopic
expression of an activated form of Akt on the FAS expression. We
found that ectopic expression of Akt significantly augmented the
FAS expression under normoxia, whereas both siRNA significantly
blocked the up-regulation of FAS under the hypoxic condition
(Fig. 3B, fourth panel). Therefore, both Akt and SREBP-1 coordinately
regulate the up-regulation of hypoxia-induced FAS expression.
To identify the exact hypoxia-responding sequence on the FAS
gene promoter, we generated a series of CAT reporter plasmids
containing up to 1,328, 616, and 115 base of the FAS promoter,
and CAT reporter activities were measured under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions as well as in the presence or absence of H2O2. As
shown in Fig. 3C (left), both hypoxia and H2O2 significantly increased
the FAS promoter activity even when the promoter sequence was
deleted to 115 bases. Because this region includes the SREBP
binding/E-box sequence, to assess the functional significance of
these sequences, we generated luciferase reporter plasmids with or
without the SREBP binding sequence and tested their responsiveness to hypoxia and H2O2. The results of the reporter assay indicate
that deletion of the SREBP binding/E-box sequence significantly
reduced the responsiveness of the FAS promoter to hypoxia and
H2O2 (Fig. 3C, right). Therefore, these results suggest that hypoxia
induced the FAS gene by activating Akt followed by induction of
SREBP-1, which then binds to the SREBP binding site of the
FAS promoter. To examine further whether SREBP-1 indeed binds to
the SREBP binding site under hypoxia, we performed ChIP assay
by precipitating SREBP-chromatin complex using anti–SREBP-1

A, MDA-MB231 cells were transplanted
into mammary fat pad of nude mice. The
tumors were grown for 3 wk, and mice
were injected with pimonidazole through
i.p. After 2 h, tumors were excised and
sliced on slides. These slides were then
analyzed by immunohistochemistry using
antibodies for FAS and pimonidazole.
Photos are shown for two representative
regions (a–b and c–d ). B, to examine the
relationship of FAS and hypoxia in tumor,
human breast tumor samples from 29
patients were sectioned and subjected to
immunohistochemical analysis using
antibodies for FAS, SREBP-1, and CA9.
Representative photos for each antibody
staining with consecutively sectioned
slides are shown. C, for each slide, fields
of high and low expression of CA9 were
randomly chosen and divided into two
groups (CA9-positive and CA9-negative).
Using consecutive slides of the identical
samples, these regions were then
analyzed by immunohistochemistry using
anti-FAS and anti–SREBP-1 antibodies.
Each sample was then further divided
according to positive and negative
expression of FAS and SREBP-1. To
evaluate the significance, the expression
of FAS and SREBP-1 in relation to CA9, m2
test was performed.

antibody followed by PCR, using the primers specific to the region of
the SREBP binding site. Our result clearly indicates that the amount
of SREBP-1 binding to this region was strongly augmented under
hypoxia compared with that in normoxic condition (Fig. 3D).
The level of FAS expression correlates with hypoxia in vivo.
To validate our in vitro results of the hypoxia-induced FAS
expression, we examined the relationship between the expression
level of FAS and hypoxic regions in an animal xenograft model. We
first transplanted human breast cell lines, MDA-MB231, into nude
mice and grew the tumor for 3 weeks. We then injected
pimonidazole, which reacts with hypoxic cells, to the mice through
i.p. After 2 h, tumors were excised and stained with antibodies for
FAS and pimonidazole. We found that FAS expression colocalized
with the area reactive to anti-pimonidazole, suggesting that
hypoxic areas strongly expressed FAS in these tumors (Fig. 4A).
To further validate these results in a clinical setting, we performed
immunohistochemical analysis for clinical samples from 29 breast
cancer patients using antibodies for FAS, SREBP-1, and CA9, which
is a hypoxia marker (34). We first stained the samples with antiCA9 and randomly chose positive and negative fields for each
specimen. These samples were then stained with antibodies for FAS
and SREBP-1. We then inspected the staining intensity of FAS and
SREBP-1 in these CA9-positive and CA9-negative regions. As shown
in Fig. 4B and C, of 29 CA9-positive regions, 21 were FAS positive
(72%) and 8 were FAS negative. On the other hand, 20 of 29 CA9negative samples (69%) were also FAS negative (P = 0.0038). CA9positive regions were also significantly correlated with SREBP-1
expression (P = 0.0037). These results indicate that FAS was
expressed preferentially in the region of hypoxia in breast cancer,
which is consistent with our in vitro data. Taken together, our
results of in vitro and in vivo experiments strongly suggest that the
expression of the FAS gene is significantly induced by hypoxia, and
that this induction is mediated by the generation of ROS followed
by the activation of Akt and SREBP-1.
Inhibition of FAS overcomes hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. Development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a
major clinical problem for the treatment of cancer patients.
Rapidly growing tumors are often under hypoxic conditions, and
hypoxia is known to induce chemoresistance (33, 35, 36). Because
our results suggest that FAS is induced by hypoxia and that the
high level of FAS protects tumor cells from apoptosis, we sought
a possibility that inhibition of FAS expression by low concentration of a FAS inhibitor overcomes the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. We first examined the effect of cyclophosphamide, a
chemotherapeutic drug commonly used for the treatment of breast
cancer, on MCF7 cells under hypoxic or normoxic condition.
As shown in Fig. 5A, cyclophosphamide induced apoptosis in MCF7
in a dose-dependent manner under normoxic condition. However,
when the cells were treated with cyclophosphamide under hypoxic
condition, cells became significantly resistant to cyclophosphamide,
indicating that hypoxia induced chemoresistance. We then treated
MCF7 cell with a combination of a FAS inhibitor (cerulenin), a PI3K
inhibitor (LY294002), and cyclophosphamide under hypoxic or
normoxic condition followed by apoptosis assay. We found that a
combination of these drugs synergistically enhanced the degree
of apoptosis under normoxic condition (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the
treatment of the cells with the combination of cyclophosphamide
and cerulenin or LY294002 under hypoxia condition blocked
hypoxia-induced resistance to cyclophosphamide. These results
suggest that a combination of cerulenin and other chemotherapeutic drugs such as LY294002 synergistically induces tumor cell

Figure 5. Inhibition of FAS overcomes hypoxia-induced chemoresistance.
A, MCF7 cells were treated with various amounts of cyclophosphamide under
normoxic (solid line ) or hypoxic (dotted line ) conditions for 48 h. Cells were
then subjected to apoptosis assay using the TMR apoptosis assay kit. B, MCF7
cells were treated with suboptimum concentrations of cerulenin (10 Ag/mL),
LY294002 (20 Amol/L), and cyclophosphamide (4 mg/mL) either alone or in
combination under hypoxia or normoxia for 48 h. Samples were then subjected to

death, and that hypoxia-induced chemoresistance is partially
blocked by suppression of the FAS expression or the Akt pathway.
We also examined the enzymatic activity of FAS and found that the
FAS activity was indeed significantly higher under hypoxic condition compared with that under normoxia even in the presence
of cyclophosphamide and cerulenin (3.8 F 1.1 versus 1.1 F 0.2,
respectively), and that the activity was inversely correlated with the
degree of apoptosis. Although currently available FAS inhibitors
are relatively toxic, using these drugs at a low concentration with
a combination of other drugs may be a rational strategy for the
treatment of chemoresistant tumors.

Discussion
Although the de novo pathway of fatty acid synthesis is quite
active during embryogenesis, normal adult cells acquire fatty acids
mainly from dietary source and rarely use the de novo pathway
because nutritional fatty acid strongly suppresses the expression of
the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (3, 4). However, cancer
cells are no longer sensitive to this nutritional signal and prefer to
use the de novo pathway. In fact, linoleic and arachidonic acid,
potent suppressors of the FAS gene of normal hepatic and
adipocytic cells, have been shown to have no significant inhibitory
effect on the expression of the FAS gene in breast cancer cells (37).
Therefore, what triggers the reactivation of the FAS gene in cancer

cells and whether they use the same signal pathway as the normal
cells are critical questions to understand the role of FAS in
tumorigenesis. When primary tumor grows >1 mm in size, it can
no longer obtain oxygen and nutrients by diffusion and requires to
promote angiogenesis by inducing proangiogenic genes as a
survival strategy (36). Therefore, tumor cells at an early stage are
usually under hypoxic condition and at a risk of apoptosis. The
reactivation of the FAS gene has been observed at a relatively early
stage in various types of cancer, and these results suggest that the
FAS gene is up-regulated by a common factor of cancer
microenvironment such as hypoxia. In this report, we have shown
that the FAS gene in cancer cell is indeed significantly up-regulated
by hypoxia, and that this up-regulation is due to the activation of
the Akt and HIF1 followed by up-regulation of SREBP-1.
Due to the high rate of proliferation and oxygen consumption,
tumors are often under hypoxic condition, which is a hallmark of
cancer. The hypoxic microenvironment is normally proapoptotic;
however, tumor cells adapt themselves by inducing various enzymes
to circumvent the problem. This induction is mediated by an
activation of the known hypoxia-sensing pathways such as HIF1 and
PI3K/Akt (38–40). In this context, it should be noted that Akt has
been shown to stabilize HIF1 in both breast and prostate cancer cells
(41, 42). Beitner-Johnson et al. (43) also showed that hypoxia
dramatically increased phospho-Akt (Ser473) in PC3 cells, and
this activation of Akt was completely abolished by wortmannin, a
PI3K inhibitor. It is worth noting that Akt was also found to be
up-regulated by H2O2 (44). Consistent with these results, we have
shown that hypoxia and H2O2 indeed induced activation of Akt
(Ser473) and HIF1, and that this activation was accompanied by the
up-regulation of SREBP-1, a major factor involved in the regulation
of the FAS gene. In cancer cells, it has been shown that PI3K/Akt
signaling significantly augmented the expression of SREBP-1 in
response to oncogenic signaling, including overexpression of various
growth factors (11). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the
tumor suppressor, PTEN, which inhibits Akt by dephosphorylation,
significantly suppressed the expression of the FAS gene (22).
Therefore, the activation of the Akt pathway followed by induction
of SREBP-1 is considered to be one of the major pathways of
reactivation of the FAS gene in cancer cell, and this reactivation is
triggered at least by the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment. This notion is also strongly supported by our results of
immunohistochemical analysis on clinical samples where FAS
expression was significantly colocalized with the CA9-stained
hypoxic area. It is known that Akt is quickly phosphorylated under
hypoxic condition and that this activation of Akt results in upregulation of HIF1 (45–47). Our results indeed showed that LY294002
inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF1 as well as the expression of FAS and
p-SERBP-1 (Fig. 3B). Our results also indicate that HIF1 inhibitor,
YC-1, strongly blocked phosphorylation of SREBP-1 (Fig. 3A), which
is in good agreement with the recent finding by Li et al. (48) that
HIF1 plays a key role in activation of SREBP-1 in vivo. Therefore, the
hypoxia-induced FAS expression is considered to be mediated via
phosphorylation of Akt followed by activation of HIF1 and SREBP-1.
Hypoxia generally induces apoptosis in normal cells partly due to
malfunction of the respiratory system in mitochondria, which
requires oxygen for ATP production (49). However, cancer cells
have an unusual tolerance to hypoxic condition because they use
the glycolysis pathway to generate ATP even under normoxic
condition, which has been known as the Warburg effect (50). On
the other hand, hypoxia was shown to cause an increase of NADH/
NADPH ratio in a cell due to increased flux of glycolysis, and this

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (4). February 15, 2008

change of redox balance induces inactivation of PTEN followed by
activation of Akt (21). Therefore, up-regulation of FAS may be
partly due to increased glycolysis and the following Akt activation.
It is likely that the increased activity of FAS enhances lipogenesis,
which consumes more NADPH and rebalances redox so that cells
can compensate for the shortfall of oxygen.
As we and others previously reported, inhibition of the function
or expression of FAS results in apoptosis of tumor cells (7–11). This
cell death is considered to be caused by the suppression of CPT1
followed by accumulation of ceramide, which in turn activates
proapoptotic genes such as BNIP3 (13). It should be noted that
BNIP3 was found to be one of proapoptotic genes induced by
hypoxia, and that specific blocking of the FAS expression by siRNA
significantly increased the expression of BNIP3 followed by
apoptosis (13, 51). In fact, we have shown that the expressions of
FAS and BNIP3 are indeed inversely correlated in breast cancer
patients (13). Therefore, FAS may act as an ‘‘antiapoptotic’’ gene
under hypoxia. This notion is consistent with the previous
observations of immunohistochemical analysis on human tumor
samples where overexpression of FAS was found to be a relatively
early event (7–11). We also reported that the expression of FAS was
inversely related to that of PTEN in human breast tumor
specimens, and the expression of higher FAS and lower PTEN is
correlated to poor survival of patients, suggesting that the PTEN
inactivation followed by Akt activation induced the FAS expression
(22). Although the direct involvement of FAS in the initial step of
tumorigenesis is yet to be determined, overexpression of FAS in
tumors seems to be a survival strategy of the cancer cells to block
apoptosis caused by hypoxic condition.
Because inhibition of FAS causes tumor cell apoptosis, FAS is
considered to be a promising target for cancer therapy. The
pharmacologic inhibitors of FAS such as cerulenin [(2R , 3S)-2,3epoxy-4-oxo-7, 10-trans,trans-dodecadienamide], C75, and Orlistat
have been shown to significantly suppress the cellular FAS level and
also to induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells
including breast, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancer, although their
specificity of action and potential side effects remains to be of
some concern for actual clinical use (7–11). On the other hand,
traditional chemotherapeutic agents commonly used for breast
cancer treatment such as cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and
doxorubicin often become ineffective due to chemoresistance,
particularly under hypoxic condition (52). The exact mechanism of
the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance has not been well understood; however, one possible mechanism is the activation of the
Akt pathway and following expression of antiapoptotic genes
including FAS (33). Our results of the in vitro experiments clearly
indicate that a FAS inhibitor, cerulenin, indeed partially overcame the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of cyclophosphamide.
Although the existing FAS inhibitors are still somewhat toxic, a use
of lower concentration of these drugs in combination with the
current chemotherapeutic drugs may enhance the therapeutic
effect by reducing the hypoxia-induced chemoresistance.

ERRATUM

The following correction should be made in the arti
cle by Beck and Valentine, â€œThe
Aerobic Carbohydrate
Metabolism
Glycolysis
substitute

of Leukocytes
in Health and Leukemia.
I.
and Respiration,â€•
November,
1952, page 821;
for the last paragraph:

The data in Table 3 permit several interesting calcu
lations.

If one compares

the amount

of glucose

actually

disappearing with the sum of the amount equivalent to
lactic

acid

produced

plus

that

equivalent

to 02 con

by the glucose utilized by 16 per cent in CLL. If the as
sumption is made that, in this respect, the myeloid and
lymphoid celLsof leukemia are similar to those of nor
ma! blood, it may be that the computed

normal figure

represents a summation of the myeloid (M) and
lymphoid (L) cells that make up the normal leukocyte
population.

Thus,

if M = +0.27

and

L = â€”0.16 and

the normal differential is 65 per cent M and So per cent
L, then

0.65 (+0.27)
+ 0.35 (â€”0.16) = +0.12
sumption, it is seen that the amount of glucose â€œcleav
age productsâ€•exceeds the amount of glucose utilized b
a figure identical to the observed +0.12 for normal
12 per cent in N and 27 per cent in CML and is exceeded leukocytes.
