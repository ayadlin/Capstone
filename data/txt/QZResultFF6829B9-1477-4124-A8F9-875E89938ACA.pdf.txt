ABSTRACT
Our previous studies show that the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) induced by interleukin 6 (IL-6) treatment contributes to multidrug
resistance formation in lung cancer cells, but the exact role of ATM activation
in IL-6 increased metastasis is still elusive. In the present study, matrix
metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and MMP-13 were firstly demonstrated to be involved
in IL-6 correlated cell migration. Secondly, IL-6 treatment not only increased MMP3/MMP-13 expression but also augmented its activities. Thirdly, the inhibition
of ATM phosphorylation efficiently abolished IL-6 up-regulating MMP-3/MMP-13
expression and increasing abilities of cell migration. Most importantly, the in vivo
test showed that the inhibition of ATM abrogate the effect of IL-6 on lung cancer
metastasis via MMP-3/MMP-13 down-regulation. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate that IL-6 inducing ATM phosphorylation increases the expression of
MMP-3/MMP-13, augments the abilities of cell migration, and promotes lung cancer
metastasis, indicating that ATM is a potential target molecule to overcome IL-6
correlated lung cancer metastasis.

initial step for metastasis. MMP-3 has been revealed to
remodel ECM [14–15] and has a close correlation with
the progression of breast, gastric and lung cancer [16–18].
Meanwhile, MMP-13 was also documented to be activated
by MMP-3 and contribute to metastasis [19–21]. The
activities of MMP-3/MMP-13 could be increased by TNF-α
treatment and mediated TNF-α augmented metastasis [22].
But until now, little is known about the roles of MMP-3 and
MMP-13 in IL-6 correlated lung cancer metastasis.
Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a serine/
threonine kinase that is activated by DNA double strand

INTRODUCTION
Multidrug resistance (MDR) formation and metastasis
are the important issues for lung cancer therapeutic failure
[1]. Tumors [2–5] or stromal cells [6–8] expressing
interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been documented to promote tumor
metastasis [1, 9–10]. Our previous study reveals that IL-6
contribute to lung cancer chemotherapeutic resistance [11].
The good correlation of IL-6 level and poor clinical outcome
of lung cancer, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer patients
indicates that IL-6 might be a pivotal molecule to overcome
inflammation-correlated lung cancer metastasis [12–13].

protein expression, and contributes to chemotherapeutic
resistance [24–25]. The effect of IL-6 on ATM raises the
question of whether ATM activation is involved in IL-6
correlated lung cancer metastasis. Nevertheless, little is
known about the role of ATM phosphorylation in IL-6
increased expressions of MMP-3 and MMP-13.
In the present study, we found that the high
IL-6 level reveals both the increased expression of
MMP-3/MMP-13 and the enhanced migration abilities
of lung cancer cells. Then, the inhibition of ATM
phosphorylation abolishes IL-6 increased expression of
MMP-3/MMP-13, hence abrogates IL-6 correlated lung
cancer metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. All these
findings demonstrate that IL-6 inducing ATM activation
increases the expression of MMP-3/MMP-13, augments
the abilities of cell migration and promotes lung cancer
metastasis, indicating that ATM is a potential target
molecule to overcome IL-6 correlated lung cancer
metastasis.

migration was determined. Both the broad-spectrum
inhibitor (NOB) and the specific inhibitors, such as
HYD (MMP-1), SB-3CT (MMP-2), NNGH (MMP-3)
and UK-356618 (MMP-13), efficiently abolished the
effect of IL-6 on cell migration in NCI-H446 (Figure 2a)
and A549 cells (Supplementary Figure S2). As MMP3/MMP-13 plays the pivotal roles in TNF-α increased
metastasis [22], we therefore investigated the role
of MMP-3/MMP-13 in IL-6 enhanced lung cancer
metastasis. As shown in Figure 2b, the silencing of
MMP-3 and MMP-13 abrogated the effect of IL-6 on
cell migration in NCI-H446 cells. Together, these data
demonstrate that MMP-3 and MMP-13 are the key
MMPs in IL-6 promoting lung cancer metastasis.

IL-6 increases MMP-3/MMP-13 expression
and activity in lung cancer cells
As the cells that had higher level of IL-6
(Figure 1) also revealed higher MMP-3/MMP-13 expression
(Figure 3a), we next explored the effect of IL-6 on MMPs’
expression by IL-6 replenishment or siRNA silencing. The
IL-6 replenishment increases MMP-3/MMP-13 expression
not only in protein level (Figure 3b), but also in mRNA
level (Figure 3c) in NCI-H446 and NCI-H1299 cells. On the
other hand, MMP-3/MMP-13 expression can be decreased
by IL-6 silencing in A549, LTEP-a-2 and NCI-H520 cells
(Figure 3d). Importantly, the activities of MMP-3/MMP13 were also increased by IL-6 replenishment (Figure 3e).
Apart from MMP-3/MMP-13, the expression of MMP-1/
MMP-2 was also found to correlate with the level of IL-6
(Supplementary Figure S3). All these results indicate that
IL-6 increases MMPs expressions and activities in lung
cancer cells.

RESULTS
IL-6 level correlates cell migration abilities
in lung cancer cells
To explore the effect of IL-6 on cell migration, we
firstly determined IL-6 levels in a panel of lung cancer
cells. Contrast to NCI-H446 and NCI-H1299 cells,
there is a relatively higher IL-6 level in A549, LTEP-a-2
and NCI-H520 cells (Figure 1a–1b). Consistent with
the higher IL-6 level, the more migration cells were
observed in A549, LTEP-a-2 and NCI-H520 cells
(Figure 1c). When NCI-H446 cells were replenished with
IL-6, the ability of cell migration increased accordingly
(Figure 1d). Meanwhile, the down-regulation of IL-6 in
A549, LTEP-a-2 and NCI-H520 cells led to a significant
decline of migration cells (Figure 1e). As IL-8 was
reported to affect cell migration by mediating angiogenic
activity [26], we next detected the IL-8 level in lung cancer
cells. No difference was found between NCI-H446 and
A549 cells (Supplementary Figure S1a). As the increased
migration cells is usually yielded by promoted cell
proliferation or augmented cell migration, the observation
that IL-6 had no effect on cell proliferation excludes the
possibility that IL-6 increases cell migration by promoting
proliferation (Supplementary Figure S1b–S1c). The above
results demonstrate that the IL-6 level correlates cell
migration abilities in lung cancer cells.

Inhibition of ATM phosphorylation abrogates
the effect of IL-6 on cell migration in lung cancer
cells
Despite the effects of IL-6 in ATM phosphorylation
[11] and in tumor invasion [9–10] were documented
respectively, the exact role of ATM phosphorylation in
IL-6 increasing lung cancer metastasis is still unknown.
Indeed, both the silencing of ATM/p65 (Figure 4a)
and the inhibition of relative kinases (Figure 4b,
Supplementary Figure S4) abrogated IL-6’s effect on
cell migration in NCI-H446 cells. The silencing of
ATM/p65 in A549, LTEP-a-2 and NCI-H520 cells also
decreased the ability of cell migration (Figure 4c). As the
silencing of these genes had no effect on cell proliferation
(Supplementary Figure S5a–S5b) and down-regulation
of MMP-3/MMP-13 inhibited cell migration (Figure 4d),
the inhibition of ATM phosphorylation abolishing IL-6’s
effect on cell migration indicates that the phosphorylation
of ATM is involved in IL-6 increasing lung cancer
metastasis.

DISCUSSION

Inhibition of ATM phosphorylation abrogates
IL-6 increasing MMP-3/MMP-13 expression

Our previous studies demonstrate that ATM
phosphorylation [25] and elevated IL-6 level [11]
contribute to chemotherapeutic agents-inducing MDR
formation in lung cancer. The present study demonstrated
that high IL-6 level increases both expressions and
activities of MMP-3 and MMP-13, hence augments cell
migration abilities of lung cancer (Figures 1–3). Moreover,
the inhibition of ATM phosphorylation not only abrogates
IL-6 increased, MMP-3/MMP-13 mediated cell migration
in vitro (Figure 4–5), but also suppresses IL-6 correlating
lung cancer metastasis in vivo (Figure 6).
The degradation of ECM and basement membrane
by MMPs is a critical process in tumor invasion and
metastasis [27]. Although down-regulation of MMP-3
reduced lung cancer spontaneous metastasis [28], genetic
ablation of MMP-3 did not significantly affect breast cancer
metastasis [29] was also documented. MMP-13 abrogation
was demonstrated to reduce breast cancer metastases by
inhibiting osteoclast cells’ differentiation [30] or decreasing
stromal MMP-13 expression [31]. While MMP-13
replenishment increased tumor metastasis by promoting
angiogenesis [32], MMP-13 inactivation inhibited stromalpromoting melanoma metastasis [33], indicating that
the interactions of tumor and stromal cells might be an
important issue for MMP-13 participating in metastasis.
Here, we investigated the role of ATM phosphorylation in
IL-6 increasing MMP-3/MMP-13 expression, but the exact
mechanism by which MMP-3/MMP-13 promoting lung
cancer metastasis is still to be clarified.
As the MMP family is comprised of more than
25 related zinc-dependent enzymes [34], the findings
that MMP-3/MMP-13 is involved in ATM activation
increasing cell migration (Figures 2–6) and IL-6 increases
MMP-1/MMP-2 expression (Supplementary Figure S2)
cannot exclude the possibility that other MMPs might
also contribute to inflammation-associated lung cancer
metastasis. Meanwhile, we also mention that EMT
contributes to tumor progression and metastasis [35–37].
Apart from transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) [38],
IL-6 has been documented to be involved in lung cancer
EMT via signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3) [39], Notch [40–41] pathway. As EMT could
be affected by the composition and structure of ECM
[42], the findings that ATM phosphorylation increases
MMP-3/MMP-13 expression and promotes lung cancer
metastasis indicate that the phosphorylation of ATM might
be involved in IL-6 promoting EMT. The exact effects and
mechanism of ATM activation on IL-6 increasing EMT
require further investigation.
STAT3 has been documented to be involved in
tumor growth and metastasis in many types of tumor
[43–50]. Once binding to IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and
gp130 receptor, IL-6 could activate STAT3, mitogen-

To further explore the role of ATM phosphorylation
in IL-6 augmenting lung cancer metastasis, a panel
of lung cancer cells was conferred the inhibition of
ATM/p65 and the MMPs’ expressions were monitored.
While the usage of ATM/p65 inhibitors abrogated IL-6
increasing MMP-3/MMP-13 expression in protein level
(Figure 5a), the silencing of ATM/p65 abolished IL-6’s
effect on MMP-3/MMP-13 expression in mRNA level
(Figure 5b). Importantly, the suppression of ATM/p65
in LTEP-a-2 and NCI-H520 cells also decreased high
IL-6 level correlating MMP-3/MMP-13 expression
(Figure 5c). Apart from MMP-3 and MMP-13, MMP1/MMP-2 expression was obviously decreased by the
inhibition of ATM/p65 (Supplementary Figure S5c–
S5d). All together, these data suggest that ATM could
be activated by the treatment with IL-6, hence increases
the expression of MMP-3/MMP-13 and promotes lung
cancer metastasis.

Inhibition of ATM activation abrogates IL-6
increasing lung cancer metastasis in vivo
Tail vein injection is a widely accepted method
to measure metastatic potential and the ability of
cancer cells to attach to blood vessels and survive in
the lung [21]. Similar amounts of lung cancer cells
suffered from ATM inhibition anchored in the vessels
of the lungs (data not shown). Despite IL-6 treatment
increased cell retention in the lungs, the inhibition
of ATM obviously abrogated IL-6’s effect on lung
cancer cell retention (Figure 6a), indicating that ATM
phosphorylation facilitates lung cancer cell metastasis.
To address this issue, in vivo lung cancer metastasis
test was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin sections
revealed nest cells with prominent and irregular nuclei
(Figure 6b–6c, Figure S6a–S6b). The number of cancer
nests in the lung represents the proximal colonization
of the cancer cells (Figure 6b–6c), while the metastatic
nodes in the liver represent the remote metastasis (Figure
S6a–S6b). Importantly, the inhibition of ATM abrogated
IL-6’s effect on cancer nests formation in the lung of
NCI-H446 or A549 cells transferred recipients (Figure
6b–6c). Moreover, the expressions of MMP-3/MMP-13
in both lung (Figure 6d–6e) and liver (Supplementary
Figure S6c–S6d) were also suppressed by the inhibition
of ATM. As the silencing of ATM/p65, IL-6, MMP-3/
MMP-13 efficiently abrogated ATM phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S7) and gene expression
(Supplementary Figure S8), the above observations
demonstrate that high level of ATM phosphorylation
contributes to IL-6 correlating MMP-3/MMP-13
expression and lung cancer metastasis in vivo.

activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) pathways and increase tumor metastasis
[43–44, 51], indicating that IL-6 increasing metastasis is
IL-6R/gp130 dependent. Meanwhile, a novel mechanism
that IL-6 promoted prostate cancer metastases through
a soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) without activation of
STAT1, STAT3 or MAPK was also documented [52].
In the present study, despite ATM phosphorylation was
achieved by IL-6 treatment, the exact mechanism that IL-6
inducing ATM activation still needs further investigation.
The migration and invasion characteristics that
are related to inflammatory response play important
roles in the development of lung cancer. While Erk1/2NF-κB pathway was reported to be partially involved
in inflammatory factors TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-6
correlated lung cancer invasion [53], p38-NF-κB and
STAT3-NF-κB pathways were demonstrated to inhibit
miR-365 expression and regulate IL-6 repressing miR98 levels respectively [54–55]. All these studies indicate
that Erk1/2, p38 and STAT3 are up-stream molecules of
NF-κB. The activation of ATM-NF-κB increasing MDR
associated genes expression [11] indicates that ATM is
another up-stream kinase of NF-κB. Hence, it was not
surprise to find that the inhibition of NF-κB pathway
was more efficient than that of ATM in abolishing IL-6’s
effects on MMP-3/MMP-13 expression and cell migration
(Figure 4, 5). As the STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser(727)
is triggered by active RSK2 or JNK1 in the presence of
intracellular phosphorylation process of ATM [56], the
exact crosstalk between ATM and other NF-κB upstream
molecules in IL-6 correlated lung cancer metastasis still
need further exploration.
ATM, which expresses in a variety of tumor, is
commonly considered as a tumor suppressor for its
role in DNA damage repair machinery [57–63] and in
SATB1-induced tumorigenic progression [64]. In the
present study, our results reveal that IL-6 inducing ATM
phosphorylation increases lung cancer metastasis via upregulation of MMP-3/MMP-13. Consistent to our study,
high phosphorylation level of ATM decrease diseasefree survival was also documented [65]. Hence, there is
still controversial about the role of ATM, to suppress or
activate tumor progression. As an early DNA damageresponse kinase, ATM might immediately repair SATB1induced chromatin remodeling, inhibit genetic alterations,
and suppress malignant transformation. Therefore, it is no
surprise to find that ATM abundant breast epithelial cells,
but not ATM depletion cells, were resistant to SATB1induced malignant progression [64]. On the other hand,
the phosphorylation of ATM can also be induced by
IL-6 treatment without obvious DNA double break [11].
Similar to the present study, hypoxia treatment increasing
ATM phosphorylation without apparent DNA damage
was demonstrated to promote breast cancer metastasis
via NF-κB pathway [66]. Thus, the high phosphorylation
level of ATM contributing to IL-6 correlated lung cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastasis indicates that the functions of ATM might be
dependent on cell stress, DNA damage and signaling
networks.
Taken together, our results reveal for the first time
that the inhibition of ATM phosphorylation efficiently
decreases the expressions of MMP-3/MMP-13 and
inhibits IL-6 correlated lung cancer metastasis, indicating
that the inhibition of ATM phosphorylation is a potential
strategy for dealing with inflammation correlating lung
cancer metastasis.

48 h stimulation. The expressions of MMP-3 and MMP-13
were determined via western blot analysis. The expression
of ß-actin was used as a loading control. The relative band
intensity of western blot was quantified using IMAGE J
software and indicated under each lane.

Pathogen-free BALB/c nude mice (5–6 weeks
old, female) were bought from the Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences and kept
at the Animal Center of Xiamen University. The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of the Xiamen University.

Transwell migration assay
Cell migration ability was determined via transwell
migration assay [22]. Briefly, 4 × 103 cells pretreated with
IL-6, siRNA or related kinase inhibitors were seeded onto
the top chamber of Transwell inserts (24-well insert, 8
μm pore size; Corning) in serum-free-medium. Culture
medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the lower
compartment was used as a chemo attractant. After 18 h
incubation, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane
were wiped out using a cotton swab. Then the cells that
migrated to the lower surface were fixed and stained.
Cell migration ability was determined by calculating the
number of migrated cells in three visual fields per well by
microscopy with 100 × magnification.

RT-qPCR
Endogenous IL-6 expression of lung cancer cell
lines and MMPs expression were investigated by RTqPCR analysis. Briefly, the cellular RNA was extracted,
and reverse transcription was performed using PrimeScript
Reverse Transcriptase. Quantitative PCR analysis was
performed using ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System
in the presence of SYBR Green. The cycling parameters
were 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C
for 5 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, with a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min; a melting curve analysis
was subsequently conducted. Each assay was performed
in triplicate, and the relative expression levels (defined
as fold changes) of the target genes were normalized to
the folds of corresponding control cells. The PCR primer
sequences are listed in Table 1.

In vivo lung retention assays

To detect the release of IL-6 in corresponding lung
cancer cell lines and determine MMP-3/MMP-13 activity,
1 × 105 cells plated in 24-well plates were treated with
PBS or IL-6 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h and the supernatant was
collected. The IL-6 concentration or the MMP-3/MMP13 activity was determined by enzyme double-antibody
indirect immunoassays with respective ELISA kits in
accordance with manufacturer protocol [67].

Early migration ability was determined via lung
retention assays [21]. Briefly, 5 × 105 NCI-H446 cells
pretreated with IL-6, siRNA or related kinase inhibitors
were labeled with CFSE (1:1000 dilution in PBS),
trypsinized and injected into BALB/c nude mice through
the tail vein in 200 μl saline. Mice were sacrificed after 1
h (to show the early arrive at the lung) and 10 h. The lungs
were washed, fixed and examined for fluorescently labeled
cells under fluorescence microscope. Lung retention is
represented as fluorescence dots per field, and 10 fields
per mouse were analyzed. Four mice per condition were

A549 cells were transfected with ATM siRNA. 48 h posttransfection, 8 × 105 cells per mouse were transferred to
BALB/c nude mice in 100 μl saline through the tail vein.
The mice were further subcutaneously conferred IL-6
administration, once a day. The dose of IL-6 was 1.5 μg/
kg for first 3 days, then 2.5 μg/kg throughout next 3 days
and reached 5 μg/kg over next 7 days. 2 days after the
last injection, the lungs and livers were dissociated and
preserved for further studies. Each experiment had four
mice per condition.

In vivo cell migration ability and the expression
of MMP-3/MMP-13 in lung were determined via H&E
and Immunohistochemistry staining [68]. Briefly, freefloating lung sections (4 μM) were obtained using a
slicing system (Leica RM2135). For H&E staining,
the sections were stained with hematoxylin, then
counterstaining with eosin. For immunohistochemistry
staining, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched
in H2O2, and 90% formic acid min was used to expose
epitope. The primary antibody was applied overnight at
4°C and then biotinylated secondary antibody at room
temperature. After a final wash, the slides were developed
with diaminobenzidine substrate by using the avidin-biotin
HRP system. The signals were quantified using the ImagePro Plus software.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times
to confirm the similar results. Data were presented as
the mean ± SEM. Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA
with the post Newman-Keuls test was applied. Statistical
differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.
