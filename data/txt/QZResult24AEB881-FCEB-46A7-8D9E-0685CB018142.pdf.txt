Abstract
Understanding and estimating the genetic hazards of exposure
to chemical mutagens and anticancer drugs in humans
requires the development of efficient systems for monitoring
germ line mutation. The suitability of a single-molecule PCR–
based approach for monitoring mutation induction at the
mouse expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus Ms6-hm
by chemical mutagens and anticancer drugs has been
validated. The frequency of ESTR mutation was evaluated in
the germ line of male mice exposed to the well-characterized
alkylating agent and mutagen, ethylnitrosourea, and four
widely used anticancer drugs, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide,
mitomycin C, and procarbazine. The dose-response of ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation was found to be very close to
that previously established using a pedigree-based approach
for ESTR mutation detection. Paternal exposure to the
clinically relevant doses of bleomycin (15–30 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (40–80 mg/kg), and mitomycin C (2.5–5 mg/kg)
led to statistically significant, dose-dependent increases in
ESTR mutation frequencies in the germ line of treated male
mice. Exposure to procarbazine led to a maximal increase in
mutation frequency at 50 mg/kg, with a plateau at the higher
concentrations. The results of this study show that the singlemolecule PCR technique provides a new and efficient
experimental system for monitoring the genetic effects of
anticancer drugs, capable of detecting increases in mutation
rates at clinically relevant doses of exposure. In addition,
this approach dramatically reduces the number of mice
needed for the measurement of germ line mutation induction.

Introduction
In recent decades, improvements in cancer treatment have
produced dramatic increases in survival rates among patients. For
example, in the United States, between 1985 and 1999, the 5-year
survival rate for children diagnosed with cancer was 75.8% (1).
Furthermore, the prevalence of childhood cancer survivors among
young American adults ages 20 to 39 is approximately 1 in 640 (2).
However, along with surgery, the mainstays of cancer treatment are
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, both of which are genotoxic and
mutagenic. The survivors of therapy can experience the late
adverse effects, including the development of secondary, treatment-related tumors (3). Another major adverse effect of
radiotherapy and chemotherapy is mutagenesis, which can cause
heritable genetic damage and diseases in the offspring of survivors

(4). It should be stressed that the majority of chemotherapy
treatments compromise normal sexual function and often lead to
prolonged infertility (5). The long-term genetic effects of parental
exposure to anticancer drugs therefore represent a major concern
to genetic toxicology.
The analysis of germ line mutation induction in mice currently
provides the main source of experimental data for evaluating the
genetic risk of exposure to chemical mutagens and anticancer
drugs in humans (4, 6). The majority of the mouse data have been
generated using either the specific locus method (Russell 7-locus
test) or the dominant lethal test (4, 6). Both tests provide important
information on the mutagenicity of chemicals and the stagespecificity of mutation induction, but require the profiling of very
large numbers of exposed mice and their offspring, which
increasingly, is unacceptable in terms of animal usage. Most
importantly, these tests lack the sensitivity to detect mutation
induction in the germ line of mice exposed to low and often
intermediate concentrations of chemical mutagens. Given that
these are the doses of most concern to genetic toxicology, the
development of new, more sensitive and efficient approaches for
evaluating the germ line effects of chemical mutagens is warranted.
We have previously developed a highly sensitive technique for
monitoring radiation-induced mutation in the germ line of male
mice (7–9). This technique employs highly unstable expanded
simple tandem repeat (ESTR) loci. These loci were originally
termed minisatellites, but have been renamed to distinguish them
from the much more stable true minisatellites in the mouse
genome (10). Unstable ESTR loci consist of homogenous arrays of
short repeats (4–6 bp) and show very high spontaneous mutation
rates in the mouse germ line, observed as size changes in the alleles
of these loci (10–12). The analysis of ESTR mutation induction in
the germ line of male mice has shown that exposure to ionizing
radiation results in elevated mutation rates, detectable at doses
that were previously inaccessible using standard approaches for
monitoring germ line mutation in mice (7–9, 13). We have also
conducted a detailed analysis of ESTR mutation induction in the
germ line of male mice exposed to some well-recognized mutagens
and anticancer drugs (13, 14). The results of these studies were
consistent with those obtained earlier using traditional approaches
to assess germ line mutation in mice, thus further validating the
ability of ESTR loci to reflect DNA damage in the mouse germ line.
It should be stressed that the results of our studies also show the
high efficiency of ESTR mutation induction after acute exposure of
the early premeiotic stages of mouse spermatogenesis (8, 13, 14);
thus, making these loci a useful tool for the analysis of long-term
genetic effects of paternal exposure, similar to that following
cancer chemotherapy.
It should be noted that the abovementioned ESTR data were
obtained using a pedigree-based approach which requires the
profiling of several hundred offspring of exposed parents to detect
significant changes. Although this compares favorably with the

mutation frequencies (15). This approach involves diluting bulk
sperm genomic DNA and amplifying multiple samples of DNA,
each containing approximately one ESTR molecule, and allows the
detection of a indefinitely large number of de novo mutants in a
single male. Here, we present the results of the first extensive study
aimed at validating the suitability of the SM-PCR technique for
monitoring mutation induction in the germ line of male mice
exposed to chemical mutagens and anticancer drugs. We have also
investigated the sensitivity of this technique for the analysis of
germ line mutation induction within a clinically relevant dose
range of exposure to anticancer drugs.

hundreds of thousands of mice is required, it has been found that a
single-molecule PCR (SM-PCR)–based technique for monitoring
ESTR mutation can be used to further reduce the number of mice
needed to measure radiation-induced changes in germ line

Animals. Male 6-week-old C57BL/6  CBA/Ca F1 hybrid mice were
obtained from Harlan. Animals received a single dose of the test compound,
dissolved in PBS and delivered via i.p. injection, at 8 weeks old. Caudal
epididimy were collected 8 weeks after treatment and from age-matched
16-week-old untreated control mice. Animal procedures were carried out
under Home Office project license no. PPL 40/2605.
Chemicals. Bleomycin sulfate, cyclophosphamide, ethylnitrosourea, and
mitomycin C were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Procarbazine was
obtained from Sequoia Research Products, Ltd.
Preparation of sperm DNA. Sperm DNA samples were prepared in a
laminar flow hood as previously described (15, 16). Approximately 5 Ag of
each DNA sample was digested with 20 units of MseI for 2 h at 37jC; MseI
cleaves outside the ESTR array and distal to the PCR primer sites used for

PCR amplification and was used to render genomic DNA fully soluble
prior to dilution. Each digested DNA sample was diluted to f10 ng/mL in
5 mmol/L of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) in the presence of 5 Ag/mL of carrier herring
sperm DNA (Sigma) prior to mutation analysis.
Mutation detection. The frequency of ESTR mutation was evaluated
using SM-PCR (15, 16). The Ms6-hm ESTR locus was amplified in 10 AL
reactions using 0.4 Amol/L flanking primers HM1.1F (5¶-AGA GTT TCT AGT
TGC TGT GA-3¶) and HM1.1R (5¶-GAG AGT CAG TTC TAA GGC AT-3¶). The
Expand High-fidelity PCR System (Roche) was used (0.035 units/AL) with
1 mol/L of betaine and 200 Amol/L each of deoxynucleotide triphosphate.
Amplification was carried out at 96jC (20 s), 58jC (30 s), and 68jC (8 min)
for 30 cycles on a PTC-225 DNA Engine Tetrad (MJ Research). To increase
the robustness of the estimates of individual ESTR mutation frequencies, on
average, 135 amplifiable molecules were analyzed for each male mouse.
PCR products were resolved on a 40-cm-long agarose gel and detected by
Southern blot hybridization as previously described (8). Following Southern
blot hybridization, autoradiographs were scored by two independent
observers. The frequencies of ESTR mutation and standard errors were
estimated using a modified approach proposed by Chakraborty (17). DNA
fragment sizes were estimated by the method of Southern (18), with a
200-bp DNA Step Ladder (Promega) included on all gels.

Results

30 mg/kg of bleomycin is restricted to premeiotic spermatogonia
(25). It was also shown that paternal premeiotic exposure to
smaller doses of this drug (<20 mg/kg) did not induce dominantlethal mutations (25) or chromosome aberrations (26) in male
mice. We found only a small, statistically nonsignificant increase in
ESTR mutation frequency following exposure to 15 mg/kg of
bleomycin, but a much more dramatic, significant increase after
treatment with 30 mg/kg (see Table 1; Fig. 3A). Our results are
therefore in line with the specific-locus data, and together with the
results previous studies (25, 26), also indicate that exposure to the
clinically relevant doses of this anticancer drug (<10 mg/kg) may
not result in a measurable mutation induction in the mouse male
germ line. However, given that the mutagenicity of bleomycin in
female mice substantially exceeds that for males (27), this notion
should be treated with caution.
Cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide is a widely used
anticancer drug and immunosuppressive agent which, following
metabolic activation, forms DNA adducts, mostly N 7-substituted
guanine derivatives and phosphoester adducts (28, 29). Single doses
for anticancer treatment in humans are typically between 400 and
1,200 mg/m2 (23); the equivalent mouse dose for this drug is 130 to
400 mg/kg. The stage-specificity of mutation induction by this drug

Experimental design. Mutations were scored at both the
smaller (f3 kb) CBA/Ca-derived allele and the larger (4–5 kb)
C57BL/6 allele. As in our previous studies, only bands showing a
shift of at least 1 mm relative to the progenitor allele were scored
as mutants (Fig. 1).
The well-characterized alkylating agent and mutagen, ethylnitrosourea, was used as a test compound to validate the SM-PCR
technique. Mutation induction by four diverse anticancer drugs,
bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C, and procarbazine,
was then measured. The doses of exposure to anticancer drugs
were calculated according to Food and Drug Administration
guidelines recommending multiplying human doses by 12.3 per
kilogram of bodyweight to give equivalent doses for mice (19). By
sacrificing animals 8 weeks after treatment, it was ensured that the
sperm assessed were derived from exposed As spermatogonia (20).
Ethylnitrosourea. Ethylnitrosourea is one of the best-characterized chemical mutagens in the mouse germ line (21). Using
the pedigree-based approach, we have previously shown that premeiotic exposure to ethylnitrosourea doses of between 12.5 and
75 mg/kg produced highly significant increases in ESTR mutation
rates (14). We found that similar increases could be detected using
SM-PCR when measuring the effects of 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg of
ethylnitrosourea. All three doses produced significant increases in
mutation frequencies (Table 1). The pattern of ESTR mutation
induction was linear within the interval of doses from 12.5 to
50 mg/kg (Fig. 2A) and, most importantly, was very close to that
previously established by conventional pedigree-based analysis
(Fig. 2B). This apparent similarity clearly shows that SM-PCR can
be used to reliably monitor mutation induction in the male germ
line following exposure to chemical mutagens.
Bleomycin. Bleomycin is widely used in the treatment of
squamous cell cancers, melanoma, sarcoma, testicular cancer, and
Hodgkin’s and non–Hodgkin’s lymphomas (22). Human single-dose
exposure to this highly toxic antibiotic does not exceed 15 units/m2
(23); the equivalent mouse dose is between 7 and 8 mg/kg. As
exposure to bleomycin mainly results in the induction of doublestrand breaks, it has been classified as radiomimetic (22, 24).
Previous analysis of mutation induction at specific loci has shown
that its mutagenicity in male mice receiving a single dose of

is an issue of some controversy. Thus, the analysis of mutation
induction at specific loci showed that paternal exposure to
120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide mostly affects postmeiotic
spermatids (30). However, according to the results of other studies,
premeiotic exposure to this drug results in significant increases in
the frequency of dominant mutations and chromosome aberrations in treated males (reviewed in ref. 28). We found that
premeiotic spermatogonial exposure to cyclophosphamide resulted
in a linear increase of ESTR mutation frequency in the germ line of
male mice exposed to 40 and 80 mg/kg (see Table 1; Fig. 3B). In this
respect, our results are at odds with the specific locus data showing
that postmeiotic exposure to the high doses of this drug does not
affect mutation rate in male mice (30). According to our previous
results, the pattern of premeiotic mutation induction at ESTR
and specific loci is similar (8, 13, 14), the cyclophosphamide data
therefore indicate that premeiotic paternal exposure to this drug
may be mutagenic. Given that highly significant increases in ESTR
mutation rate were detected in male mice whose exposure was
below a level equivalent to the doses typically administered to
patients, our data raise the important issue of long-term genetic
effects of paternal exposure to cyclophosphamide in humans.
Mitomycin C. A streptomycin-derived antibiotic, mitomycin C,
is a widely used anticancer drug. Following metabolic activation, it

forms a number of sequence-specific DNA adducts, including
alkylated monoadducts and cross-linked adducts (31, 32). Human
single doses are typically between 10 and 20 mg/m2 (23), with the
equivalent mouse dose of 3 to 6 mg/kg. The results of previous
studies have shown that exposure of male mice to >5 mg/kg of
mitomycin C significantly increases the mutation rate in premeiotic spermatogonia (33, 34). Our SM-PCR data further show the
mutagenicity of this drug. Doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg produced
significant increases in ESTR mutation frequency that were dosedependent (see Table 1; Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results
suggest that exposure to the clinically relevant doses may be
regarded as a potential long-term genetic risk factor for humans.
Procarbazine. Procarbazine is used to treat a number of
cancers, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Metabolites of this drug
inhibit DNA polymerase and react directly with DNA (35). Human
single doses do not exceed 150 mg/m2 (23); the equivalent mouse
dose for this drug is f50 mg/kg. The results of a previous study
showed that the lowest dose of procarbazine that significantly
increased mutation rate at the specific loci in male mice was
400 mg/kg (36). However, we found procarbazine to be maximally
mutagenic in the germ line of male mice at 50 mg/kg (Table 1). The
doubling of that dose produced no further increase in mutation
frequency, suggesting that a plateau of ESTR mutation induction

had been reached (Fig. 2D). We therefore suggest that exposure to
the clinically relevant doses of this anticancer drug could have
long-term mutagenic effects in the human germ line.
ESTR mutation spectrum. The incidence of ESTR mutations
involving gain or loss was defined for 576 mutations found in
control and exposed males. In all exposed groups, the incidence of
ESTR mutations involving either the gain or loss of repeat units did
not significantly differ from that in control males (Table 1). We next
determined the spectra of ESTR mutations. This analysis was
restricted by the resolution of agarose gel electrophoresis as the
smallest mutational changes detectable at the CBA/Ca and C57BL/
6 alleles were three and seven repeats, respectively (Fig. 1). Within
each treatment group, the mutation spectra for the males exposed
to different doses of mutagens did not significantly differ (data not
shown). The combined distributions of length changes at ESTR loci
were indistinguishable between controls and all exposed groups
(Fig. 4). We therefore conclude that exposure to the anticancer
drugs analyzed here does not affect the size of ESTR mutation
changes. These data are in line with the results of our previous
studies showing no difference in the structure of spontaneous and
radiation- or ethylnitrosourea-induced ESTR mutants in the mouse
germ line (37, 38). We and others have previously hypothesized that
ESTR mutation induction cannot be attributed to the direct
targeting of these small genomic loci by ionizing radiation and
chemical mutagens (8, 9, 13, 14, 39). One of the arguments for
nontargeted mechanisms comes from the comparison of ESTR
mutation spectra in the germ line of control and exposed mice (37).
Given the similarities in the structure of spontaneous and induced
ESTR mutants reported here, our data indicate that mutation
induction at ESTR loci by anticancer drugs may also result from the
initial mutagen-related DNA damage elsewhere in the genome, and
later, indirect mutation at these loci. The mechanisms underlying
this nontargeted process are still unknown.

Discussion
The main purpose of our current study was to determine
whether the SM-PCR approach could be used as a biomonitoring

male mice (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0.7909). The progenitor allele was assumed

system to assess the germ line mutagenicity of anticancer drugs in
mice. Thus far, the lack of sensitive and relatively inexpensive
approaches has been a severe limitation to the in-depth study of
germ line mutagenicity. Given that mutation induction in mice is
still the main source of experimental data used to evaluate the
genetic risk for humans, over recent years, a considerable effort has
been made to develop more sensitive and efficient approaches for
monitoring germ line mutation in mice. To date, a vast amount of
experimental data has been obtained using two in vivo techniques—the transgenic mouse mutational assay (40) and pedigreebased ESTR mutation assay (41). In contrast with traditional germ
line mutation assays, both techniques require the profiling of
relatively small numbers of control and exposed mice. As far as the
SM-PCR approach is concerned, the results of previous studies
clearly show that even in comparison with our ESTR pedigreebased mutation assay, this technique dramatically reduces the
number of mice needed for the measurement of germ line
mutation frequencies in irradiated male mice (15, 42) and those
exposed to environmental mutagens (43).
Given the results of our early studies demonstrating the high
efficiency of pedigree-based ESTR mutation assay for the analysis
of mutation induction in the germ line of male mice exposed to
well-characterized chemical mutagens (14), we sought to extend
this analysis to encompass a number of widely used anticancer
drugs. As the efficiency of SM-PCR for monitoring germ line
mutation in male mice exposed to chemical mutagens has never
been properly validated, in this study, the pattern of ESTR mutation
induction in the germ line of male mice exposed to the wellcharacterized mutagen, ethylnitrosourea, was first established. As
the dose-response for ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation established by the SM-PCR technique was very close to that previously
established by the conventional pedigree-based analysis (Fig. 2), we
can therefore conclude that SM-PCR can be used to reliably
monitor mutation induction in the male germ line following
exposure to chemical mutagens.
We next addressed the important issue of sensitivity of SM-PCR
for monitoring mutation induction in the germ line of male mice
exposed to the four widely used anticancer drugs. Table 2 presents
a comparison of the results on mutation induction in male mice
following premeiotic exposure to ethylnitrosourea and anticancer
drugs as obtained by the specific locus test (Russell 7-locus test)
and SM-PCR. Apart from the obvious difference in the number of
animals required for the analysis of mutation induction by the two
techniques (850,860 versus 37), this comparison also revealed that
the sensitivity of the SM-PCR technique exceeds that of the Russell
7-locus test. For all the anticancer drugs included in this study, we
analyzed mutation induction within the range of the clinically
relevant doses for humans, whereas many previous publications
investigated the effects of exposure to much higher doses. The
SM-PCR data presented here clearly show that the mutagenicity of
some drugs, including, for example, cyclophosphamide, following
premeiotic paternal exposure may be higher than previously
reported, thus raising the important issue of their long-term
genetic effects in humans. It should however be stressed that,
although our results show the effects of premeiotic exposure to
anticancer drugs, they do not provide enough evidence on whether
the stability of stem cells in the germ line of treated animals may
remain compromised over a substantial period of time. Future
studies should address this important issue.
Recently, a number of transgenic mutational models were used
to investigate germ line mutation induction in male mice exposed

to ethylnitrosourea and the same anticancer drugs analyzed here.
Although the number of animals required for the analysis of
mutation induction by this technique and SM-PCR is similar, their
sensitivities dramatically differ. For example, the MutaMouse
transgenic model was only used for the analysis of mutation
induction in the germ line of male mice exposed to 150 mg/kg of
ethylnitrosourea (44–47), whereas in our current and previous
studies (14), a significant increase in ESTR mutation frequency was
detected at doses as low as 12.5 mg/kg. The same is also true for
the anticancer drugs analyzed here. Thus, the analysis of
premeiotic mutation induction in the germ line of BigBlue
transgenic mice exposed to 100 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide
yielded negative results (48), whereas our SM-PCR data clearly
show high mutagenicity of this drug at doses as low as 40 mg/kg
(Table 1). Premeiotic exposure to 4 mg/kg of mitomycin C did not
affect the frequency of gpi-y mutation in the germ line of
transgenic male mice (40); in contrast, our data show that this
anticancer drug is mutagenic at doses of V2.5 mg/kg. It was
previously reported that doses of procarbazine as high as 750
mg/kg did not affect mutation rates at the lacZ gene in testicular
DNA of MutaMouse transgenic males (49), yet in our study, a highly
significant increase in ESTR mutation frequency was detected in
the germ line of male mice exposed to just 40 mg/kg of
procarbazine. Taken together, these data clearly show that the
sensitivity of SM-PCR techniques to a wide range of chemical
mutagens and anticancer drugs substantially exceeds that of a
variety of mouse transgenic assays.
In summary, our results show that the SM-PCR technique offers
a highly efficient and more ethically acceptable method of
assessing the mutagenicity of anticancer drugs and other chemical
mutagens. The main advantage of this assay is its ability to detect
mutation induction in the germ line of male mice at doses that are
in or even below the clinically relevant range. As ESTR mutation

induction predominantly occurs at the early premeiotic stages of
mouse spermatogenesis, the SM-PCR technique can therefore
provide a useful tool for the analysis of long-term genetic effects of
paternal exposure, which are similar to those after cancer
chemotherapy. Given that this approach allows the recovery of
large numbers of de novo mutants from single individuals, it
dramatically reduces the number of mice needed for the
measurement of germ line mutation induction. In addition, as
SM-PCR directly establishes the frequency of ESTR mutation in the
germ line of exposed parents, it also reduces experimental time by
removing the necessity to breed them. Taken together, the results
of this study show that the SM-PCR technique represents a very
powerful and efficient tool for monitoring germ line mutation
induction by a variety of mutagens, including commonly used
anticancer drugs. It also seems that the ESTR assay should be
included in a battery of existing tests for germ line mutagenicity.
Given the unique mechanism(s) of spontaneous and induced ESTR
mutation, we would recommend that this technique should be
used in parallel with other traditional end points such as gene
mutations, chromosome aberrations, etc.
