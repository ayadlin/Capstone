Summary
Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs frequently in breast cancer.
However, clinical results of single-agent PI3K inhibitors have been modest to date. A
combinatorial drug screen on multiple PIK3CA mutant cancers with decreased sensitivity to PI3K
inhibitors revealed that combined CDK 4/6/ PI3K inhibition synergistically reduces cell viability.
Laboratory studies revealed that sensitive cancers suppress RB phosphorylation upon treatment
with single-agent PI3K inhibitors, but cancers with reduced sensitivity fail to do so. Similarly,
patients' tumors that responded to the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 demonstrated suppression of pRB,
while nonresponding tumors showed sustained or increased levels of pRB. Importantly, the
combination of PI3K and CDK 4/6 inhibitors overcomes intrinsic and adaptive resistance leading
to tumor regressions in PIK3CA mutant xenografts.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a key regulator of growth, survival,
and metabolism in both normal and malignant cells (Engelman et al., 2006; Hanker et al.,
2013; Katso et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012; Yuan and Cantley, 2008;
Zhao and Vogt, 2008). Over 70% of breast cancers have activation of the PI3K pathway
through mechanisms such as HER2 amplification, deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN,
or oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA (Garcia-Martinez and Alessi, 2008). Inhibition of PI3K
therefore represents a potentially attractive strategy for treatment of breast cancer, and a

number of agents have entered clinical trials (Bachman et al., 2004; Bendell et al., 2012;
Mahadevan et al., 2012; NCT00876109; NCT00620594; NCT01219699).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Laboratory studies and these early clinical trials indicate that several of the PI3K inhibitors
(PI3Ki) demonstrate preferential inhibition of tumors with PIK3CA mutations (Bendell et
al., 2012; O'Brien et al., 2010). However, while long term stabilization and partial tumor
responses have been observed in PIK3CA breast cancers treated with PI3Ki
(NCT01219699), the majority of PIK3CA mutant cancers still do not experience substantial
regressions.
We recently identified a strategy to overcome both de novo and adaptive resistance to PI3Ki
through combined inhibition of PI3K and mTORC (Elkabets et al., 2013). Thus far, dual
PI3K and mTOR inhibitors such as BEZ235 and GDC-0980 have made their way into
clinical trials (Markman et al., 2012), though the therapeutic window for these agents is
limited due to treatment related toxicities. Our present study sought to identify additional
strategies that may increase the efficacy of PI3Ki, by both improving initial responses and
overcoming adaptive resistance.

Results
PI3Ki resistant PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines fail to undergo growth arrest and
maintain higher levels of pS6
Despite oncogenic activation of the PI3K pathway, PI3Ki are not as effective as single
agents as was initially hoped (Maira, 2011, NCT01219699). In order to determine ways to
improve response to PI3K inhibition, we studied three PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell
line models that had adapted to PI3Ki after chronic exposure to the drug. Two of the cell
lines, T47D and MDA-MB-453 (453), were treated with the p110α-isoform specific
inhibitor BYL719 whereas the third cell line, MCF7, was treated with the pan-isoform
inhibitor GDC-0941.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The chronically exposed cells were more resistant to PI3Ki than the treatment naïve (i.e.,
parental) cells. They demonstrated increased viability in the presence of 1 μM of PI3Ki
(BYL719 or GDC-0941, as indicated, Figure 1A) and a rightward shift in the dose response
curve (Figure 1B). Consistent with this finding, the chronically exposed cells exhibited less
cell cycle arrest in response to the indicated PI3Ki, with significantly more cells remaining
in S phase relative to parental cells (Figure 1C). Of note, PI3Ki fail to induce substantial
apoptosis in the parental and resistant cells (Figure S1A). Both parental and resistant cell
lines exhibited suppression of Akt phosphorylation upon treatment with PI3Ki. However,
phosphorylation of S6 was maintained to a greater extent in resistant cells, as we recently
reported (Elkabets et al., 2013) (Figure 1D). These results suggest that sensitivity to PI3Ki in
these PIK3CA models may be dependent on the ability to suppress mTOR signaling and
modulate cell cycle progression.
These resistant cells also displayed cross-resistance to other PI3Ki. For example, the T47DR
and 453R cell lines were less sensitive to GDC-0941 than the corresponding parental lines,
and the MCF7R cell line was also less sensitive to BYL719 (Figure S1B-C). The difference

between parental and resistant lines was less pronounced to the dual PI3K/mTORC inhibitor
BEZ235 (Figure S1D) as might be expected since maintenance of mTORC activity
promotes resistance in these cells. In general, the parental and resistant lines were similarly
sensitive to other targeted therapies and the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (Figure S1E,
Table S1), suggesting that resistance is specific to inhibitors of the PI3K pathway.
Combination drug screen identifies inhibitors of CDK 4/6, mTORC, and Akt as sensitizers
to PI3Ki in resistant cell lines
To identify potential therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to PI3Ki, we performed a
combinatorial drug screen using 42 agents that inhibit pathways involved in growth,
metabolism, and apoptosis (Figure 2A). Cell proliferation was assessed after treatment with
increasing doses of candidate drugs in the presence and absence of PI3Ki, and agents were
ranked according to the greatest shift in dose response that occurred with the addition of
PI3Ki. Compounds with false discovery rate (FDR) values ≤ 0.05 were considered
sensitizers for each individual cell line (Figure 2B, Figure S2A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a composite analysis of all cell lines, LEE011 emerged as the strongest sensitizer across
all three resistant models (Figure 2C). LEE011 is a highly specific inhibitor of CDK 4/6
(Figure S2B-C). Additionally, the allosteric mTORC inhibitor Rad001, catalytic mTORC
inhibitor AZD8055, and the Akt inhibitor MK2206 were sensitizers in two resistant lines.
Five other agents sensitized just one of the three resistant lines (Table S2). These findings
suggest that targeting downstream nodes in the PI3K signaling pathway may sensitize PI3Ki
resistant cancers.
Akt substrate phosphorylation and Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) levels
correlate with sensitization by Akt inhibitor

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The finding that Akt inhibitors overcame resistance to PI3Ki in two of the PI3Ki resistant
lines was initially surprising because Akt phosphorylation appeared to be suppressed by
PI3Ki in all of the resistant lines (Figure 1D). To determine if certain resistant cells might
retain a low level of PI3K pathway activity in the presence of PI3Ki, we examined levels of
phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and Akt substrates upon treatment with the PI3Ki to which each
cell line was made resistant. Because both 453R and T47DR cells were re-sensitized to
PI3Ki by an Akt inhibitor whereas MCF7R cells were not, we compared 453R and T47DR
to MCF7R cells. Upon treatment with the respective PI3Ki, we observed that
phosphorylation of the Akt substrates, ATP citrate lyase and PRAS40 (pATPCL and
pPRAS, respectively), were higher in 453R and T47DR, than in MCF7R cells (Figure 3A).
Furthermore, PIP3, which accumulates upon phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PIP2) by PI3K and therefore serves as a more direct measure of PI3K activity,
was higher in 453R and T47DR cells relative to their parental counterparts, but not in
MCF7R cells relative to MCF7 (Figure 3B). It appears therefore that residual PI3K activity
may contribute to resistance to PI3Ki in 453R and T47DR cells, but not in MCF7R cells.
These results reinforce the notion that there is low-level persistence of Akt signaling in some
of the resistant lines that is not appreciated simply by measuring pAkt.

Consistent with this, and confirming the results of the drug screen, the Akt inhibitor
MK2206 re-sensitized the 453R and T47DR cell lines to 1 μM BYL719 (Figure 3C).
However, MK2206 did not re-sensitize the MCF7R cells to PI3Ki (either GDC-0941 or
BYL719 1 μM) (Figure 3D). This is consistent with the finding that PI3Ki alone was
sufficient to suppress PIP3, pAkt, and phosphorylation of Akt substrates in the MCF7R cells
(Figure 3A-B). In the 453R and T47DR cells, treatment with BYL719 partially reduced Akt
substrate and S6 phosphorylation levels, and addition of MK2206 enhanced suppression of
these downstream nodes of the PI3K pathway (Figure 3E). The effect appeared to be cell
line rather than inhibitor specific, as the 453R and T47DR lines were also sensitized by
MK2206 to 1 μM GDC-0941 with similar effects on pAkt and its substrates'
phosphorylation (Figure S3A-B). By contrast, in MCF7R, addition of MK2206 had no effect
on proliferation (Figure 3D), phosphorylation of Akt substrates (which were largely
suppressed by PI3Ki alone), or pS6 (Figure 3F), regardless of whether BYL719 or
GDC-0941 was used as the PI3Ki. Thus incomplete suppression of PIP3 production and
subsequent residual Akt signaling may contribute to resistance to PI3Ki in some contexts
and may be overcome by combination of PI3K and Akt inhibition.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Of note, all three resistant cell lines displayed cross-resistance to single agent MK2206, both
in regards to viability and signaling (Figure 3C-F). In the MCF7R cells, it appears that Akt
does not regulate mTORC1 activity. In the 453R and T47DR cells, it is likely that elevated
PIP3, pAkt and AKT signaling at baseline account for incomplete inhibition of this pathway
with Akt inhibitors alone. In T47DR (which have elevated PIP3 levels), it is also possible
that PIP3 effectors other than Akt contribute to sustained mTORC1 signaling. Indeed others
have reported the importance of Akt independent effectors of PI3K in PIK3CA mutant breast
cancers (Vasudevan et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next evaluated the top sensitizer in the 453R line, lapatinib, and confirmed that it
combined with PI3Ki to further suppress proliferation (Figure S3C), and phosphorylation of
Akt substrates and S6 (Figure S3D). This was not surprising as 453 cells have both HER2
amplification and PIK3CA mutation, and both are contributing to the activation of PI3K
signaling in these cells. As discussed above, the baseline absolute levels of pAkt and PIP3
are elevated in 453R (Figures 1D and 3B) relative to the parental cell line. Because of the
higher basal levels of these signaling molecules, treatment with a given dose of BYL719
results in higher residual levels of pAkt and PIP3 in the resistant line compared to the
parental line. However, suppression of HER2 phosphorylation with lapatinib combines with
BYL719 to fully inhibit this pathway (Fig. S3D). These findings reinforce the notion that
residual PI3K activity contributes to the relative resistance of certain cell lines, and that
suppression of this remaining PI3K activity reverses resistance.
CDK 4/6 inhibition sensitizes cells with acquired and intrinsic resistance to PI3K inhibition
In the present study, the highest scoring drug in the composite analysis of the drug screen
was LEE011, a highly specific CDK 4/6 inhibitor currently under clinical development
(Figure S2B-C). To confirm that the combination of CDK 4/6 and PI3Ki exhibit synergistic
activity against PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines, we treated each of the parental and
resistant cell lines with increasing concentrations of PI3Ki and LEE011 alone and in

combination. As observed previously, PI3K inhibition alone was relatively ineffective at
inhibiting proliferation of resistant cells (Figure 4A). However, for all three resistant cell
lines, and, to a lesser extent, parental lines, we observed a synergistic interaction between
LEE011 and PI3Ki in suppressing cell proliferation (Figure 4A, Figure S4A). The
combination effect in the resistant lines appeared to rely on cell cycle arrest, rather than
apoptosis, as an increase in the population of cells in G1, but not sub-G1 was observed
(Figure 4B). Cell cycle arrest ultimately translated into decreased long-term cell viability
(Figure 4C).
The chemically unrelated CDK 4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 also sensitized the resistant lines
to PI3K inhibition (Figure S4B-C), indicating that the observed effects of LEE011 are likely
on target. Similar results were obtained using siRNA to CCND1 (which encodes for Cyclin
D1) or CDK4 and CDK6 (Figure S4D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The initial screen was performed in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells that had developed
resistance after chronic exposure to PI3Ki. However, we also aimed to determine if this
combination is effective in PIK3CA mutant cancers that were intrinsically resistant to singleagent PI3Ki. Importantly, adding LEE011 increased the efficacy of PI3Ki in five different
PI3KCA mutant breast cancer cell lines with intrinsic resistance to PI3Ki (Figure S4E). In all
but one line (MFM223), the effect of the combination was greater than the single-agents
alone.
The BYL719/LEE011 combination was examined more broadly in a panel of 22 breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 4D-E). This panel included twelve PIK3CA mutant and ten PIK3CA
wild-type lines (Barretina et al., 2012). Combination effects were scored relative to Loewe
dose-additivity (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) using a weighted “Synergy
Score” calculation (Lehar et al., 2009). Comparison of the combination effects between the
two subsets of cell lines demonstrated stronger synergy (p = 0.012, ANOVA) in the PIK3CA
mutants, suggesting that PIK3CA mutant breast cancers may be particularly susceptible to
this combination.
RB phosphorylation is maintained in the setting of PI3Ki resistance, but suppressed by
either mTORC or CDK 4/6 inhibitors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently, it was reported that suppression of TORC1 signaling is necessary for sensitivity of
PIK3CA mutant cancers to PI3Ki, and combined PI3K and TORC1 inhibition is effective in
PIK3CA mutant cancers in which PI3Ki do not fully inhibit TORC1 (Elkabets et al., 2013).
Consistent with this finding, the combination of TORC1 plus PI3K inhibition scored highly
in our drug screen. However, it was not known whether specific TORC1 outputs exist whose
inhibition is critical for response to PI3Ki. That CDK 4/6 emerged as the strongest sensitizer
to PI3Ki was therefore particularly interesting to us given that CDK 4/6 exerts its activity by
binding and activating Cyclin D1, whose expression is often regulated by TORC1 (Averous
et al., 2008; Takuwa et al., 1999). The CDK 4/6-Cyclin D1 complex phosphorylates and
inactivates the tumor suppressor RB, and other pocket proteins. In turn, RB, when
phosphorylated, releases E2F transcription factors, thereby promoting cell cycle progression
from G1 to S phase. We therefore questioned whether RB remains phosphorylated, i.e.,

inactive, in the setting of resistance to PI3Ki, and whether sensitization to PI3K inhibition
by CDK 4/6 inhibitors occurred via de-phosphorylation, i.e., activation, of RB.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Consistent with this hypothesis, we noted that while PI3Ki monotherapy led to suppression
of pAkt and pRB in treatment naïve, sensitive PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell lines, it was
insufficient to suppress pRB or mTORC1 substrates in the resistant lines (Figure 5A).
Addition of mTORC inhibition, however, led to Cyclin D1 downregulation and suppression
of pRB in these resistant lines (Figure 5A-B). Thus, maintenance of RB phosphorylation in
the resistant lines was due to a failure to suppress mTORC signaling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We also observed that CDK 4/6 inhibition suppressed pRB in the acquired resistant lines
(Figure 5C-D), and that siRNA directed against CCND1 or CDK4 and CDK6 yielded the
same effect (Figure S4D). Thus, in the resistant cells, it appeared that PI3K inhibition
suppressed Akt phosphorylation, but failed to suppress CDK 4/6 activity, as measured by
RB phosphorylation. By adding either an mTORC or CDK 4/6 inhibitor to a PI3Ki in the
resistant cells, RB phosphorylation was suppressed as well as Akt, recapitulating the effect
of single-agent PI3Ki in the sensitive cells. RB knockdown in parental MCF7 and 453 cell
lines conferred resistance to LEE011 (Figure S5A), moreover, RB knockdown in resistant
lines led to resistance to the combination of LEE011 and PI3Ki (Figure S5B), further
supporting that the effects of CDK 4/6 inhibition on these cells are mediated, at least in part,
via RB activation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Investigations were undertaken to determine if restoration of RB function was necessary for
the growth arrest induced by PI3Ki in sensitive cells. CCND1 overexpression limited
suppression of pRB by PI3K inhibition but only partially abrogated the response to PI3Ki
(Figure S5C-D). Perhaps this should not be surprising since PI3K inhibition still suppressed
growth signals such as Akt and mTORC1 (Figure S5D). Similarly, knockdown of RB was
insufficient to cause resistance to PI3Ki (Figure S5E-F). However, additionally, in the
setting of RB knockdown experiments, increased expression of other pocket proteins (such
as p107) may have compensated for RB loss in cells treated with PI3Ki (Figure S5F).
Indeed, a subset of E2F target genes was still suppressed by PI3K inhibition in the RB
knockdown cells (Figure S5G). Furthermore, both mTORC1 and Akt were still suppressed
in by PI3Ki in the RB knockdown cells (Figure S5F). In total, these experiments suggest that
inhibition of Cyclin D/ CDK 4/6 activity is not the sole mediator of growth arrest in
response to PI3Ki, at least when Akt and mTORC1 are still suppressed. However, when
combined with PI3Ki in a resistant line, both Akt and Cyclin D/ CDK 4/6 are inhibited,
leading to impairment of cell cycle progression (Fig. 4B).
Maintenance of pRB may serve as a clinical biomarker of both acquired and de novo
resistance to single-agent PI3K inhibition
The findings noted above suggest that suppression of pRB may serve as a biomarker for
response to PI3K inhibition. Indeed, there was a good correlation between the doses of
PI3Ki required to inhibit cell proliferation and RB phosphorylation in sensitive parental
lines (Figure S6A and Figure 1B), and resistant cells failed to suppress RB phosphorylation
in response to PI3Ki. Thus, we determined if suppression of RB phosphorylation among
treatment naïve PIK3CA mutant breast cancers correlated with sensitivity to single-agent

PI3Ki. As shown in Figure 6A, in a panel of 10 PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines,
suppression of pRB correlated with sensitivity to BYL719. The effect appeared to be
unrelated to the PI3Ki that was used: in the intrinsically resistant CAL51 cells, addition of
either BYL719 or GDC-0941 led to a reduction of pAkt but did not suppress pRB unless
LEE011 was added (Figure S6B).
To determine if analysis of changes in pRB would similarly discriminate sensitive from
resistant cancers in patients, we assessed 8 paired biopsy specimens of patients enrolled in
clinical trials of BYL719. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders as
previously described (Elkabets et al., 2013). Patients with response to PI3Ki had initial
suppression of pRB on treatment relative to baseline. Meanwhile, nonresponders had
maintained or increased levels of pRB on treatment relative to baseline (Figure 6B-D, Figure
S6C). Moreover, three patients who initially responded ultimately progressed, and had
biopsies at that time. Although the responding cancer had suppression of pRB, when it
became resistant, pRB levels were restored. These data demonstrate that suppression of pRB
may be a marker of response to PI3Ki therapy in the clinic and reinforce the notion that
combined treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor may have increased clinical anti-tumor
activity.

Combining PI3Ki and LEE011 overcomes intrinsic and acquired resistance in vivo
The efficacy of this combination was next examined in vivo. The activity of this
combination was initially examined in vivo using tumor xenografts derived from the
MCF7R line, and we observed a non-significant trend towards improved efficacy of the
combination over either single-agent therapy (Figure S7A). Although this activity confirmed
our in vitro studies, we turned our attention to studying treatment naïve PIK3CA mutant
breast cancer models. Despite the sensitivity of some PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cell
lines in vitro, we and others have observed that single-agent activity of PI3Ki in vivo, even
in the most sensitive models in vitro, is modest (Elkabets et al., 2013; Jamieson et al., 2011;
Liu et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2011). This is highly
consistent with the clinical trial results to date, in which there has been limited clinical
activity of PI3Ki as single-agents in PIK3CA mutant breast cancers. Thus, we speculated
that the PIK3CA mutant cancers that were sensitive in vitro take on more resistant features
in vivo, perhaps maintaining CDK 4/6 activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We first examined the MCF7 xenograft tumor models and noted that single agent
GDC-0941 slowed tumor growth, but failed to induce regressions (Figure 7A). While Akt
suppression by GDC-0941 was noted, RB phosphorylation was unaffected (Figure 7B).
While the reason for the relative discordance between in vivo and in vitro sensitivity remains
unclear, importantly, the correlation with resistance and maintenance of RB phosphorylation
was retained in vivo, and was effectively overcome by addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor. We
also examined the efficacy of the combination of LEE011 and GDC-0941 in the xenograft
model of the CAL51 cells, a PIK3CA mutant breast cancer line that had maintained RB
phosphorylation and was resistant in vitro (Figure S4E). Single-agent GDC-0941 slowed
CAL51 tumor growth, but progression still occurred (Figure 7C). Pharmacodynamic studies
demonstrated that single-agent GDC-0941 partially suppressed pAkt but failed to suppress

RB phosphorylation (Figure 7D). However, the combination with LEE011 led to
concomitant suppression of RB phosphorylation and suppression of tumor growth (Figure
7C-D).
In T47D xenografts, we also observed a significantly improved effect from combination
therapy compared to either single agent BYL719 or LEE011 (Figure 7E). Similar to the
MCF7 xenograft tumors, single-agent PI3Ki led only to tumor stasis and failed to potently
suppress RB phosphorylation, despite suppression of pAkt (Figure 7F). However, mice
treated with the combination experienced suppression of both pAkt and pRB (Figure 7F).
We also treated 453 xenografts with BYL719 and LEE011, alone or in combination. In this
model, regressions were noted with single agent LEE011 therapy, but the combination of
agents of BYL719 and LEE011 led to complete regressions (Figure 7G). Furthermore,
tumors were measured after cessation of treatment on day 21, and while the LEE011
monotherapy cohort experienced tumor growth roughly two weeks later, mice treated with
the combination of agents had not exhibited tumor recurrence at the completion of the study,
5 weeks following treatment cessation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While our primary objective was to determine whether combined CDK 4/6 and PI3Ki would
be a useful strategy as the first line PI3Ki based therapy, we did also examine the efficacy of
adding LEE011 after the clear development of resistance to single-agent GDC-0941 in the
MCF7 xenografts. Three of the MCF7 xenografts with tumor growth on GDC-0941
monotherapy had LEE011 75 mg/kg added at day 28 and experienced regressions over the
subsequent three weeks (Figure 7A).
Thus, the combination of PI3Ki, pan or p110α-specific, with LEE011 was highly effective
in four different models of PIK3CA mutant breast cancer with good tolerability as
determined by stability of animal weight on treatment (Figure S7B-C). These data together
suggest that the combination of PI3K and CDK 4/6 inhibitors have substantial anti-tumor
activity in PIK3CA mutant breast cancers.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PI3Ki have led to tumor stabilization and some disease responses in PIK3CA mutant breast
cancer. However, dramatic tumor regressions are not typical. Multiple recent reports have
described mechanisms of resistance to PI3Ki, including MYC overexpression and
amplification (Ilic et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011), matrix associated resistance (Muranen et al.,
2012), activity of RSK 3/4 (Serra et al., 2013), and mTORC activation (Elkabets et al.,
2013). The goal of the present study was to identify ways to improve efficacy of PI3Ki
based therapy, by overcoming adaptive resistance but, importantly, also by improving initial
responses to PI3Ki based treatment.
By studying experimentally generated PI3Ki resistant cell line models in this study, we
identified two distinct models of resistance to PI3K inhibition (Figure 8). In the first model
(453R and T47DR), residual Akt signaling allows for sustained activity of mTORC and its
downstream effectors. Fully suppressing Akt signaling with an Akt inhibitor suppressed
phosphorylation of downstream nodes such as PRAS40 and mTORC and synergized with

PI3K inhibition. In the second model of resistance (MCF7R), PI3K remains potently
inhibited, as evidenced by suppressed PIP3 levels and Akt substrates, but mTORC activity is
sustained, likely through input from other pathways. In this model, as expected, there is no
added benefit from Akt inhibition in combination with PI3K inhibition. Importantly,
targeting downstream at CDK 4/6 sensitized both types of resistance models to PI3Ki,
highlighting the potential clinical utility of this combination across cancers that fail to
respond to PI3Ki due to diverse mechanisms.
The CDK 4/6 pathway has been implicated in a broad spectrum of cancers including breast
cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and hematologic malignancies (Arima et al., 2008;
Choi et al., 2012; Gazzeri et al., 1998; Gouyer et al., 1998; Grewe et al., 1999; Myklebust et
al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 1998; Petrovic et al., 2013). Notably,
targeting this pathway has already shown efficacy in breast cancer (NCT00721409). In a
phase 2 trial in patients with hormone receptor positive disease, the addition of the CDK 4/6
inhibitor PD-0332991 to letrozole as frontline therapy caused a statistically significant
improvement in progression free survival from 7.5 to 26.2 months. The data provided in this
manuscript point to the potential potency of using these agents in combination with PI3Ki in
PIK3CA mutant cancers.

This study reveals that insensitivity to PI3Ki is evident by persistent RB phosphorylation
and can be effectively overcome by combining a CDK inhibitor with a PI3Ki. In vitro, we
noted that PIK3CA breast cancer cell lines with both de novo and acquired resistance
maintained RB phosphorylation with PI3Ki treatment. Moreover, in samples from patients
treated with BYL719, there was a tight correlation between patient response to BYL719 and
suppression of pRB, supporting the notion that failure to suppress RB phosphorylation is
associated with resistance to PI3Ki. In studies of xenograft tumor models in vivo, PI3Ki led
to slower growth, but not frank regression, mimicking responses typically observed in the
clinical setting with PI3K monotherapy. It is notable that this includes cell lines (e.g., MCF7
and T47D cells) whose proliferation was strongly inhibited in vitro. However, RB
phosphorylation was not inhibited in vivo by single-agent PI3Ki in these models. It may be
that the maintenance of RB phosphorylation contributed to the reduced efficacy of PI3Ki in
vivo. While the reason for the differences between in vitro and in vivo sensitivity is not
immediately apparent, importantly, persistent RB phosphorylation continued to correlate
well with resistance in vivo and in patient samples. Since addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor led
to loss of pRB and tumor regressions in the in vivo models, we are optimistic that a similar
benefit will be observed in patients.
Although maintenance of pRB was associated with resistance, we observed that loss of RB
alone was not sufficient to cause resistance to PI3K inhibition. The reasons for this
observation may be twofold 1) Firstly, there may be contribution from other pocket proteins
with overlapping functions to RB, which may compensate for RB loss. This phenomenon
has been observed, for example, in Rb-/- mouse fibroblasts in which there is a compensatory
increase in p107 protein levels (Sage et al., 2003). Indeed we observed that p107 expression
was higher in RB knockdown cells relative to control cells upon treatment with PI3Ki. 2)
Secondly, loss of RB alone may be insufficient to cause resistance in cells where PI3K
inhibition continues to potently suppress multiple other effectors, such as Akt and mTORC.

Previous laboratory studies have demonstrated that PIK3CA mutant breast cancers are
amongst the most sensitive to single-agent PI3Ki (Beaver et al., 2013; O'Brien et al., 2010),
and several clinical development plans for PI3Ki exist in this genetically defined subset of
breast cancer. Although not all PIK3CA mutant cell lines that we examined exhibited
synergy with the combination, it is also notable that the PI3K/CDK 4/6 inhibitor
combination is generally more synergistic in PIK3CA mutant breast cancers than the wildtype counterparts. For these reasons, we favor initial clinical development of this
combination in breast cancers harboring PIK3CA mutant breast cancers. However, the
studies herein do not fully demonstrate that this combination will be ineffective in other
subsets of breast cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While we have previously reported an effective strategy to overcome resistance to PI3Ki,
namely combined mTORC-PI3K inhibition (Elkabets et al., 2013), CDK 4/6 and PI3K
inhibition is an alternative therapeutic strategy for PIK3CA mutant breast cancer. Given that
the most common side effects of PI3K inhibition are hyperglycemia, rash, and
gastrointestinal toxicity and those of CDK 4/6 inhibition are primarily hematologic, we are
encouraged that the non-overlapping toxicity profile between the two agents may be well
tolerated in patients, as they were in the in vivo studies. Indeed, it is likely that therapeutic
index in the clinical setting will strongly impact which combination strategy will be more
useful for treating PIK3CA mutated breast cancer. In summary, our findings suggest that
resistance to PI3K inhibition can be reversed by activation of RB using CDK 4/6 inhibition,
and further study of this combination in the clinical setting is warranted.
Experimental Procedures: For full details please see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures
Cell lines—Cell lines were verified by SNP or STR analysis and maintained at 37 degrees
in a 5% CO2 incubator. To generate resistant lines, the parental cell lines were treated with
increasing concentrations of the kinase inhibitor (starting at the GI10), until a target
concentration of 1 μM of PI3Ki was achieved.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Western Blotting—Unless otherwise indicated, resistant cells were removed from the
drug in which they were cultured for 72 hours prior to experiments. Cells were plated and
treated the following day with the indicated agent for 24 hours, after which cells lysed.
Proteins were resolved using the NuPAGE Novex Midi Gel system (Invitrogen).
Flow cytometry—Cells were plated and treated the following day with the indicated
agents. For cell cycle analyses, treatments were for 24 hours after which cells were washed,
permeabilized with triton, treated with RNAse A, and stained with propidium iodide.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on an LSR II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Viability Studies—Long-term viability assays were performed by plating and treating the
following day with the indicated agent, with drug and media replenished every 3 days until
vehicle treated cells reached confluence (8-12 days). Cells were fixed and stained with
Syto60 nucleic acid stain.

Combinatorial Drug Screen—Resistant lines were plated in 96 well plates and treated
with escalating doses of each of the 42 agents in the drug screen, in the absence or presence
of PI3Ki. Drugs were used at doses that reflected their single agent activity in a broad
spectrum of cancer cell lines (Novartis internal data). At the end of 5 days, proliferation was
assessed using Cell Titer Glo. Growth inhibition values were normalized to the measured
inhibition value at zero dose of the index compound, with or without PI3Ki. Differences in
area under the curve (AUC) with and without PI3Ki for each compound were calculated.
Patients—Patients were enrolled in the phase 1 clinical study of BYL719 (NCT01219699)
and response was assessed per RECIST criteria. Staging scans were performed prior to
treatment and every 2 cycles. Biopsies were obtained within 2 weeks of starting the study
agent, at the end of cycle 2 and at progression. Response was defined as previously
described (Elkabets et al., 2013). On treatment and progression specimens were collected
between 4 and 6 hours of the last treatment dose. All human studies were approved by the
Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent to study
was obtained as per protocol from all patients. Please see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for discussion of immunohistochemistry procedures.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mouse Xenograft Studies—Female nude mice were utilized for MCF7, T47D, and
CAL51 xenograft models and SCID mice were utilized for MD-AMB-453 xenografts. For
MCF7 and T47D xenografts, estrogen pellet implantation was performed. Tumors were
monitored until they reached an average size of 300 mm3, roughly 2-3 weeks, at which point
treatments were begun. All mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation per institutional
guidelines at Massachusetts General Hospital. Experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Statistical Analyses—Unless otherwise specified, student t tests were performed for
statistical analyses and p values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical comparison
amongst groups in xenograft studies was carried out with one way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis
test, with Dunn's multiple group comparison test (GraphPad Prism)

Significance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the catalytically active p110α
subunit, occur in 30% of breast cancers. Thus, there have been intense efforts to develop
PI3K inhibitors to treat these cancers. However, responses to these agents have been
underwhelming to date. Our study suggests that concomitant CDK 4/6 inhibition
improves initial responses to PI3K inhibitors and overcomes acquired resistance in
PIK3CA mutated breast cancers. We observed that maintenance of pRB is a biomarker
for intrinsic and acquired PI3K inhibitor resistance in vitro as well as in patients treated
with BYL719. These findings provide rationale for study of this drug combination in
PIK3CA mutated breast cancer.

following drugs, as indicated at 1 μM doses: GDC-0941 (G), LEE011 (L), or BYL719 (B) or
the indicated combinations. Fresh drug and media were applied every 72 hours until the
vehicle control treated wells were confluent, at which point all the wells were fixed and
stained with Syto-60. Absorbance was measured using an infrared imager and quantified.
Data depicted are mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *indicates
p<0.05 by student's t test.
D) 12 PIK3CA mutant (MT) and 10 PIK3CA wild-type (WT) breast cancer cell lines were
treated with BYL719 and LEE011 in dose matrices across 7 concentrations for each agent,
and assessed for proliferation after 5 days. The response of each cell line to the combination
was scored for synergy (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), and ranked by synergy
score.
E) Median synergy scores between the PIK3CA mutants and wild-type lines were compared.
* indicates p<0.05 by ANOVA.
All error bars in this figure represent +/- SEM.

Figure 5. Comparison of RB phosphorylation between resistant lines and sensitive lines following
PI3K inhibition, PI3K/mTORC inhibition, and PI3K/CDK inhibition

A) Parental and resistant cells were seeded and treated with either AZD-8055 (8055) 500
nM or the indicated PI3Ki 1 μM either alone or in combination. Lysates were made after 24
hours of treatment and probed with the indicated antibodies.
B) Cells were prepared and treated as in (A), but lysed with buffer containing 0.1% SDS.
C) Cells were treated with PI3Ki 1μM or LEE011 1μM alone or in combination and cell
lysates were prepared and probed as in (A).
D) Cells were prepared and treated as per C, but lysed with buffer containing 0.1% SDS.

Figure 6. Correlation between post-treatment pRB levels and sensitivity to single-agent PI3Ki in
vitro and in patient biopsy specimens

A) 5 sensitive PIK3CA mutant cell lines (IC50≤400nM to BYL719) and 5 de novo resistant
PIK3CA cell lines (IC50≥800nM to BYL719) were treated with media or with BYL719 1
μM (BYL) for 24 hours, and lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. The fraction
of remaining pRB (relative to actin) was calculated for both the sensitive and resistant lines
and a student's t test was performed. *indicates p<0.05 by student's t test.

B) Eight patients enrolled in early clinical trials of BYL719 were classified as responders or
nonresponders as previously described (Elkabets et al., 2013) (n=4 in each group). Biopsy
specimens were collected within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment and while on treatment.
Slides were prepared, stained and scored for pRB (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). The percentage change relative to pretreatment levels of pRB for both the
responders and the nonresponders is depicted. * indicates p<0.05 by students t-test.
C) Representative sections from a tumor that initially responded to BYL719, stained by IHC
for pRB 780 in paired biopsies prior to treatment, day 56 of BYL719 (during response), and
at progression, with quantitative H-score.
D) Representative sections from a nonresponsive tumor to BYL719, stained by IHC for pRB
780 in paired biopsies prior to treatment and at day 56 of BYL719, with quantitative Hscore.
All error bars in this figure represent +/- SEM.

Figure 8. Inhibition at vertical nodes within the PI3K pathway improves efficacy of PI3Ki

Combined inhibition of PI3K and Akt (indicated by the dashed bracket) is synergistic only
in resistant models that maintain PIP3 and phosphorylation of Akt substrates (453R,
T47DR). Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR or PI3K and CDK 4/6 (indicated by the
solid brackets) is synergistic in all resistant models; including those that maintain PIP3 and
phosphorylation of Akt substrates (453R, T47DR) and those that do not (MCF7R). *
indicates that some resistant models maintain low level flux through the PI3K and Akt
pathways.
