Abstract
RASSF1A (Ras association domain containing family 1A), a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated
in human cancers, is phosphorylated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) on Ser131 upon DNA damage,
leading to activation of a p73-dependent apoptotic response. A single-nucleotide polymorphism located in the
region of the key ATM activation site of RASSF1A predicts the conversion of alanine (encoded by the major G
allele) to serine (encoded by the minor T allele) at residue 133 of RASSF1A (p.Ala133Ser). Secondary protein
structure prediction studies suggest that an alpha helix containing the ATM recognition site is disrupted in the
serine isoform of RASSF1A (RASSF1A-p.133Ser). In this study, we observed a reduced ability of ATM to recruit and
phosphorylate RASSF1A-p.133Ser upon DNA damage. RASSF1A-p.133Ser failed to activate the MST2/LATS
pathway, which is required for YAP/p73-mediated apoptosis, and negatively affected the activation of p53,
culminating in a defective cellular response to DNA damage. Consistent with a defective p53 response, we found
that male soft tissue sarcoma patients carrying the minor T allele encoding RASSF1A-p.133Ser exhibited poorer
tumor-speciﬁc survival and earlier age of onset compared with patients homozygous for the major G allele. Our
ﬁndings propose a model that suggests a certain subset of the population have inherently weaker p73/p53
activation due to inefﬁcient signaling through RASSF1A, which affects both cancer incidence and survival. Cancer

Introduction
RASSF1A (RAS association domain family 1 isoform A) is
a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p21.3,
an area that is frequently deleted in lung and breast cancers
(1, 2). Although LOH has been observed, RASSF1A is more
frequently epigenetically inactivated by hypermethylation of
CpG islands within the promoter and the ﬁrst exon, limiting
expression in a wide variety of human cancers (3–6). High
promoter methylation levels (implying low RASSF1A mRNA
and protein levels) have been shown to associate with poor

prognosis and are thus considered an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in lung, renal, and breast
cancers as well as in uveal melanoma, hepatoblastoma, and
sarcoma (7–12). Interestingly, lower levels of RASSF1A transcript have also been correlated with the decreased radiochemosensitivity of hepatoblastoma and colorectal cell lines
(7, 13).
We have previously shown that RASSF1A responds directly to radiation and chemotherapeutic drug-induced DNA
damage via the main sensor of double-strand breaks, ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Upon DNA damage, RASSF1A
is phosphorylated by ATM on Ser131 leading to the sequential activation of MST2 and LATS1 Ser/Thr kinases, stabilization and activation of the YAP1/p73 transcriptional
complex, and ultimately, apoptosis (14, 15). Recently, a
number of components in this pathway have also been
shown to play roles in the regulation and activation of
p53 upon cellular stresses such as DNA damage and oncogenic activation. RASSF1A was shown to partially contribute
to p53-dependent checkpoint activation by blocking the
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 by MDM2 (16).
Meanwhile, MST1 was shown to promote apoptosis by
regulating the deacetylation of p53 and thereby enhancing
transcriptional activity (17). In addition, both LATS1 and
LATS2 have been shown to regulate mitotic progression and
a p53-dependent G1 tetraploidy checkpoint (18, 19). Furthermore, in response to oncogenic stress, activation of

RASSF1A SNP and STS Survival

LATS2 phosphorylates ASPP1 that shunts p53 to proapoptotic promoters and promotes the death of polyploid cells
(20).
Sequence alterations in the RASSF1A gene have been identiﬁed in nonmethylated tumors and cell lines; a number of
which have been conﬁrmed as mutations that inactivate
protein function (6, 21). These fall into predicted functional
domains proposed to exert RASSF1A biologic effects, most
notably the ATM consensus motif (22). A rare mutation of the
ATM phosphorylation site, Ser131Phe, ablates the ability of
RASSF1A to respond to DNA damage and inhibit cell growth
(15). As with the majority of alterations observed in the
RASSF1A sequence, Ser131Phe does not seem to be an inherited polymorphism that can be identiﬁed at signiﬁcant frequencies in the population (22).
RASSF1 c.397G>T (rs2073498) is a high-frequency singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) of up to 17% in European populations (International
HAPMAP 1,000 Genomes Project; Supplementary Fig. S1). It is
located close to the recognition site for ATM phosphorylation
and is nonsynonymous, predicting the conversion of alanine to
serine at residue 133 of RASSF1A (p.Ala133Ser). The minor(Ser)
allele of RASSF1A p.Ala133Ser has been associated with an
increased risk of breast cancer (23) and early-onset breast
cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (24) as well as increased
lung cancer risk in Japanese (25) and Chinese populations (26).
Here we provide a molecular explanation for these association studies, whereby we show that the predicted protein
product of the minor allele, RASSF1A-p.133Ser, is impaired in
its ability to activate both p73 and p53 tumor suppressor
signaling in cellular systems. In humans, we go on to show
that the minor allele of RASSF1 c.397G>T associates with
altered soft tissue sarcoma incidence and survival, a tumor
type that is clearly suppressed and regulated by the p53
pathway (27).

Materials and Methods
Patient populations: soft tissue sarcoma patients
A total of 121 patients (68 females and 53 males; ages 14–
87 years; mean 56 years) diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas
in the years 1991 to 2001 at the Surgical Clinic 1, University
of Leipzig, Germany, and at the Institute of Pathology of the
Martin-Luther-University Halle, Germany, were included in
the study. The mean observation time was 41 months (range
2–198 months). A total of 57 patients died from tumorrelated causes within the observation time, 64 patients were
still alive at the time of follow-up. All patients underwent
surgical treatment, 79 patients received postoperative radioand/or chemotherapy (fractionated radiation with a cumulative dose of 60.4Gy; combination treatment of doxorubicin
and ifosfamide).
Statistical analysis
Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan–Meier analysis
and the Cox multivariate proportional hazards regression
model (SPSS 16.0 software; SPSS Inc.). The Mann–Whitney
test was used to compare the age at diagnosis in the cohorts

serum, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 0.1
mmol/L MEM nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin). Cells were cultured in humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 C. Where indicated, cells

RASSF1A-p.133Ser, together with pBabe Puro. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, replated, and
exposed to puromycin to select for transfected cells before
being treated with the indicated amount of cisplatin. Fortyeight hours later, cell viability was determined using the
resazurin assay. Viability experiments were conducted in
triplicate and repeated at least twice.
In vitro kinase assay. ATM kinase assays were carried
out as previously described (15). Brieﬂy, Flag-ATM immunoprecipitates from GM16667 cells (29) were incubated with the
substrates (FLAG-RASSF1A proteins immunopuriﬁed from
H1299 tet-on inducible cells), together with radiolabeled ATP
for 90 minutes at 30 C. The kinase reactions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane, and subsequently visualized using a
BioRad Phosphorimager.
In-gel kinase assay. The MST2 in-gel kinase assay was
carried out as previously described (28).

Results
RASSF1A p.133Ser fails to activate the MST/LATS/p73
pathway in response to DNA damage
The RASSF1 c.397G>T SNP (rs2073498) describes a G to T
nucleotide change in the coding sequence of RASSF1 that
converts an alanine (GCG) to a serine (TCG) at position 133
of RASSF1A. Although the conversion of alanine to serine is a
structurally conservative one, the stability of protein secondary
structures such as a-helices has been shown to decrease with
increasing serine content (30). The 15 amino acids (residues
128–142) surrounding codon 133 of RASSF1A corresponds to
residues 199 to 214 of Nore1A/RapL, a related RASSF protein.
The crystal structure of Nore1A/RapL showed that the secondary structure of residues 200 to 215 is a-helical in conformation (31) and secondary structure prediction using the
"scratch protein predictor" analysis (32) suggested that the
homologous residues in RASSF1A adopt a similar conﬁguration (Supplementary Fig. S2A, top). Replacement of alanine at
position 133 by serine was predicted to destabilize one a-helical turn (Supplementary Fig. S2A, bottom). This suggested that
there may be a local disruption of secondary structure in the
vicinity of the ATM phosphorylation site (Ser131) in RASSF1Ap.133Ser, which might possibly affect its ability to be recognized as an ATM substrate. To investigate the impact of a
modiﬁcation from Ala to Ser at codon 133, we expressed the
RASSF1A-p.133Ala and RASSF1A-p.133Ser isoforms in U2OS
osteosarcoma cells and evaluated their ability to associate with
ATM. As observed previously (15), we found that DNA damage
increases the association of ATM with RASSF1A-p.133Ala
(Fig. 1A). By contrast, RASSF1A-p.133Ser did not seem to be
recruited to ATM upon DNA damage (Fig. 1A), suggesting that
the conversion of Ser133 to Ala affects the interaction of
RASSF1A with ATM and thus might affect phosphorylation
of RASSF1A at Ser131. Indeed, we found that an anti–phosphoSer131 antibody was able to recognize RASSF1A-p.133Ala but
not RASSF1A-p.133Ser following DNA damage, which suggested a detrimental effect on Ser131 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S2B). To verify that RASSF1A-p.133Ser displays

defective phosphorylation, both isoforms were immunopuriﬁed from transfected cells and subjected to an in vitro ATM
kinase assay to directly evaluate phosphorylation status. Figure
1B shows that DNA damage–activated ATM fails to phosphorylate RASSF1A-p.133Ser as efﬁciently as RASSF1A-p.133Ala.
The defective phosphorylation of RASSF1A-p.133Ser suggested that ATM-mediated signaling should also be affected in
response to DNA damage. Therefore we compared the ability of
RASSF1A-p.133Ala and RASSF1A-p.133Ser to activate the
MST/LATS pathway after DNA damage, using the stabilization
of the transcriptional cofactor YAP1 as a read-out. As predicted, we found that both cisplatin and ionizing radiation lead
to increased YAP1 levels in the presence of RASSF1A-p.133Ala
but not RASSF1A-p.133Ser (Fig. 1C). To determine a functional
consequence on YAP1 function, we evaluated the induction of
the proapoptotic gene, PUMA, which is a known target of YAP/
p73 transactivation in the absence of p53 (14). In H1299 cells
(p53-null) treated with cisplatin, expression of RASSF1Ap.133Ala enhances PUMA induction compared with the control, whereas RASSF1A-p.133Ser has no effect, indicating that
the serine isoform is indeed impaired in its ability to propagate
a DNA damage signal (Fig. 1D).
Previous studies have shown that overexpression of
RASSF1A-p.133Ala can overcome the requirement for signaldependent activation of the MST/LATS tumor suppressor
pathway (14, 33–35). Upon testing the abilities of both
RASSF1A isoforms to activate Flag-MST2, we found that
autophosphorylation of MST2 on Thr180 is stimulated by
coexpression with RASSF1A-p.133Ala but not RASSF1Ap.133Ser (Fig. 1E), suggesting that RASSF1A-p.133Ser has an
intrinsic defect in its ability to activate the MST/LATS pathway.
In keeping with this, we observed that stabilization of YAP1
upon coexpression of MST2 and LATS1 was enhanced by
RASSF1A-p.133Ala but not by RASSF1A-p.133Ser (Supplementary Fig. S3). Similarly, the expression level of p73 was enhanced
when RASSF1A-p.133Ala, but not RASSF1A-p.133Ser, was
cotransfected (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To conﬁrm these results, we also examined the effect of
these 2 isoforms on endogenous proteins. First, we examined
the kinase activity of endogenous MST2 using MBP (myelin
basic protein) as a substrate in the presence of [g-32P] ATP in
an in gel kinase assay. Figure 1F shows that phosphorylation of
the MBP substrate, and hence the kinase activity of MST2, is
signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence of RASSF1A.p133Ala but
not RASSF1A.p133Ser. Downstream of MST2 activation, we
also evaluated the association between MST2 and LATS1 in
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Formation of endogenous complexes between MST2 and LATS1 was stimulated by
RASSF1A.p133Ala but again to a much lesser extent by the
p.133Ser isoform (Fig. 1G). It has previously been shown that
MST2 phosphorylates LATS1 on 2 critical residues, Ser909 and
Thr1079, resulting in LATS1 kinase activation (36). Western
blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with an antibody that
speciﬁcally recognizes LATS1 on phospho-Ser909 (to monitor
kinase activation) showed that LATS1 seemed to be activated
by MST2 only in the immunoprecipitated complexes from cells
expressing the p.133 Ala isoform (Fig. 1G), consistent with the
data in Fig. 1F.

Figure 1. RASSF1A-p.133Ser is defective in response to DNA damage activation of the MST/LATS/p73 pathway. A, U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids
expressing HA-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or HA-RASSF1A p.133Ser and treated with cisplatin (20 mmol/L) and harvested 60 minutes later. Endogenous ATM was
immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies to detect the presence of RASSF1A isoforms. B,
32
immunoprecipitated FLAG-ATM was incubated with FLAG-RASSF1A proteins immunopuriﬁed from H1299 inducible cells in the presence of [g P]ATP.
Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane, and visualized using a BioRad Phosphorimager. The
membranes were subsequently probed with the indicated antibodies. C, H1299 tet-on inducible cells expressing control vector, FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala, or
FLAG-RASSF1A p.133Ser were transfected with a plasmid expressing FLAG-YAP and then treated with 2 mg/mL doxycycline for 24 hours, followed
by serum starvation overnight (16 hours). The cells were then treated either with g-irradiation (10 Gy) or cisplatin (20 mmol/L) before being harvested 60 minutes
later. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. YAP protein levels were quantitated by densitometry using
ImageJ software. The relative intensity of the YAP protein bands in cells treated with ionizing radiation or cisplatin (compared with non DNA-damaged cells) are
indicated beneath the blots. D, H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A p.133Ser
and treated with cisplatin (20 mmol/L) for 24 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. E, U2OS cells
were transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing HA-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or HA-RASSF1A-p.133Ser together with FLAG-MST2. Following serum
starvation overnight, FLAG-MST2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis using a phosphospeciﬁc MST antibody that recognizes
T180-phosphorylated MST2. Lysates were also blotted with the indicated antibodies. F, endogenous MST2 was immunoprecipitated from control H1299 teton inducible cells or cells expressing FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ser that had been serum starved overnight. The kinase
activity of MST2 in the immunoprecipitates was determined by the in-gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were
also subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies. G, U2OS cells were transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing FLAG-RASSF1Ap.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ser. Following serum starvation overnight, endogenous MST2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot
analysis with the indicated antibodies. The membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with an antibody that detects LATS1 protein phosphorylated
on Ser909, a known MST2 phosphorylation site. H, U2OS cells were transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or

To further validate the differential pathway activity, we
investigated the interaction between YAP and p73 in the
presence of the different RASSF1A isoforms. In agreement
with previous observations (14), RASSF1A.p133Ala signiﬁcantly enhances the endogenous YAP/p73 interaction, and as
expected, RASSF1A.p133Ser failed to elicit the same responses
(Fig. 1H). Taken together, these results suggested that
RASSF1A-p.133Ser has an intrinsic defect that restricts activation of the MST/LATS/p73 pathway in addition to a disabled
DNA damage response.

cells expressing RASSF1A-p.133Ala have a reduced ability to
form colonies following ionizing radiation, the growth of cells
expressing RASSF1A-p.133Ser or RASSF1A-p.131Phe was comparable with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). These data
indicated that like RASSF1A-p.131Phe, RASSF1A-p.133Ser is
impaired in its ability to regulate cell growth in response to
DNA damaging agents. As the cell viability experiments were
carried out in H1299 cells (p53 null), the inhibitory effects of
RASSF1A on cell proliferation can be attributed to p53-independent mechanisms.

RASSF1A-p.133Ser is defective in sensitizing cells to DNA
damaging agents
To evaluate the physiologic signiﬁcance of RASSF1A p.
Ala133Ser, we addressed the ability of the RASSF1A isoforms
to affect cell viability after exposure to DNA damaging agents.
H1299 cells (RASSF1A-null) were transfected with plasmids
expressing either RASSF1A-p.133Ala or RASSF1A-p.133Ser,
treated with cisplatin and evaluated for cell viability. In agreement with previous data (15), expression of RASSF1A-p.133Ala
in H1299 cells resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin (Fig.
2A). As expected, given its inability to promote p73 activation,
RASSF1A-p.133Ser does not affect the cisplatin sensitivity of
the cells compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). To
extend these observations to overall tumorigenicity, colony
forming assays were carried out with H1299 cells expressing
RASSF1A-p.133Ala, RASSF1A-p.133Ser, or RASSF1A mutated in
the ATM phosphorylation site, RASSF1A-p.131Phe. Whereas

RASSF1A-p.133Ser restricts p53 activity in response to
DNA damage
RASSF1A, MST, and LATS have been independently implicated in the regulation and activation of p53 in response to
DNA damage (16–19). Indeed, depletion of RASSF1A in HeLa
cells attenuates the stabilization of p53 and expression of its
target genes in response to cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S5).
As DNA damage activation of MST2 and LATS1 is dependent
on ATM phosphorylation of RASSF1A, we speculated that
RASSF1A p.Ala133Ser may also affect the activation of p53.
We ﬁrst examined the effect of RASSF1A-p.133Ser on p53
protein stability. In cells treated with cycloheximide to inhibit
protein synthesis, expression of RASSF1A-p.133Ala prolongs
the stability of p53 to a greater extent than RASSF1A-p.133Ser
(Fig. 3A). In response to DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and
activated which leads to the transcription and expression of
p53 target genes such as p21 and PUMA. Upon treatment with

Figure 3. RASSF1A-p.133Ser restricts p53 activity in response to DNA damage. A, U2OS cells transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing FlagRASSF1A-p.133Ala or Flag-RASSF1A-p.133Ser together with Flag-p53 were incubated with cycloheximide (50 mg/mL) for the indicated times. Cell lysates
were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, U2OS cells transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing Flag-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or
Flag-RASSF1A p.133Ser were incubated with adriamycin (0.2 mg/mL) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the
indicated antibodies. C, U2OS cells were transfected with pcDNA or plasmids expressing FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A p.133Ser and treated
with adriamycin (0.2 mg/mL) for 24 hours. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. D, U2OS tet-on inducible cells
expressing control vector, FLAG-RASSF1A-p.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A p.133Ser were mock treated or treated with 2 mg/mL doxycycline. The cell-cycle
proﬁles of these cells were determined 40 hours later by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.

adriamycin, a DNA damaging agent, expression of RASSF1Ap.133Ala enhances the accumulation of p53 and p21 (Fig. 3B).
By contrast, expression of RASSF1A-p.133Ser resulted in
diminished p53 stabilization and p21 expression compared
with controls (Fig. 3B). Complementary to these results, we
ﬁnd that adriamycin treatment leads to induction of PUMA
protein expression, which is enhanced in the presence of
RASSF1A p.133Ala but not the p.133Ser isoform (Fig. 3C). This
is consistent with the results for p21 expression in Fig. 3B,
lending support to the idea that the isoforms have differential
effects on p53 transactivation activity. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis was also carried out to monitor the cellcycle proﬁle of U2OS cells with doxycycline inducible expression of RASSF1A-p.133Ala or FLAG-RASSF1A p.133Ser. In line
with a previous report, induction of RASSF1A-p.133Ala in U2OS
cells leads to a G1 delay in cell-cycle progression (Fig. 3D;
ref. 16). However, this was not observed in cells expressing
RASSF1A.p133Ser (Fig. 3D). Our results thus far indicate that
the exchange of an alanine residue for serine at codon 133 not
only impairs the ability of RASSF1A to transmit a DNA damage
signal via ATM but also compromises its intrinsic ability to
activate the MST/LATS/p73 and p53 tumor suppressor
pathways.

RASSF1 c.397G>T and promoter methylation are
associated with poor survival outcome in patients with
soft tissue sarcomas
Inherited mutational inactivation of one copy of the p53
gene in humans results in a dramatic increase in cancer risk
(Li-Fraumeni syndrome), in which 90% of individuals with a
mutation will develop at least one cancer by the age of 60, with
soft tissue sarcomas (STS) being one of the most common (27).
Higher frequency, less penetrant, inherited SNPs that affect p53
signaling have also been clearly shown to affect STS incidence
and survival (37, 38). Our data thus far suggested that individuals carrying the minor T allele of RASSF1 c.397G>T will have
an attenuated p53/p73 signaling. We therefore wanted to
address the impact of RASSF1 c.397G>T on survival of STS
patients after DNA damaging therapies. We studied a cohort of
121 German patients (clinical and histopathologic data outlined in Supplementary Table S1), 79 of whom were treated
with radiation and/or chemotherapy (RCHT) after surgical
resection. As mentioned earlier, RASSF1 c.397G>T describes a
transition in the coding DNA sequence and the patient cohort
was genotyped accordingly, with the G and T alleles designated
as the major and minor alleles, respectively, whereby the T
allele encodes the RASSF1A-p.133Ser isoform. In this cohort,

107 (88.2%) patients were (G/G) in genotype, 11 (9.1%) patients
were heterozygous (G/T), and 3 (2.7%) patients homozygous
(T/T) for the SNP (Table 1); these percentages are comparable
with the frequencies identiﬁed in the European populations of
the 1,000 Genomes Project (Supplementary Fig. S1). There was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in tumor-speciﬁc survival
across the 3 genotypes in all 121 patients (data not shown).
However, when segregated by gender, male patients homozygous (T/T) or heterozygous (G/T) for the minor T allele
displayed signiﬁcantly shorter mean survival times compared
with the G/G genotype (11.0, 50.5, and 100.9 months, respectively (Kaplan–Meier, log-rank test P ¼ 0.016, Table 1 and
Fig. 4A), indicating an increasing trend toward poorer survival
with RASSF1A-p.133Ser. Cox multivariate regression analysis

was also carried out to determine the effect on survival,
adjusting for known independent prognostic factors of STS,
namely tumor stage and resection type (R-status; ref. 39). A
relative risk (RR) for tumor-related death of 4.82 was observed
for male patients carrying at least one T allele (Cox Regression,
P ¼ 0.034, Table 1 and Fig. 4B), suggesting a signiﬁcant
association between RASSF1 c.397G>T and survival outcome.
By contrast, there was no signiﬁcant difference in tumorspeciﬁc survival in female patients (45.3 vs. 69.6 months,
Kaplan–Meier, P ¼ 0.778; Cox Regression, RR ¼ 0.82, P ¼
0.722, Table 1 and Fig. 4A and B), suggesting a possible genderspeciﬁc effect of this locus.
Interestingly, the allelic difference in overall survival significantly increased when the multivariate regression analysis

was restricted to a subset of STS patients that had been treated
with RCHT. Male STS patients carrying the minor T allele
displayed signiﬁcantly shorter survival times compared with
patients with the G/G genotype (24.7 vs. 68.6 months, P ¼
0.039) with a signiﬁcantly increased RR of 12.75 (Table 1
and Fig. 4B), potentially indicating a poorer response to
therapy. The female STS patients, however, do not show any
signiﬁcant difference in overall survival rates after RCHT (51.9
vs. 63.0 months, Kaplan–Meier, P ¼ 0.710; Cox regression, RR ¼
1.48, P ¼ 0.627, Table 1 and Fig. 4B).
Taken together, these observations supported the hypothesis that individuals carrying the minor T allele of RASSF1
c.397G>T have attenuated RASSF1A signaling and therefore
poorer survival after sarcoma diagnosis and subsequent treatment. These observations are also concurrent with our previous study, wherein we showed that sarcoma patients whose
tumors had attenuated RASSF1 signaling through epigenetic
inactivation by hypermethylation of the promoter also asso-

ciated with poorer prognosis (12). Interestingly, the signiﬁcant
association of the T allele of RASSF1 c.397G>T with poor
survival was only found in the male patients. To further explore
the apparent sex-speciﬁc differences in responses to RASSF1
c.397G>T in overall survival of the patients in this cohort and to
expand these analyses to include the well-documented epigenetic modiﬁcation of RASSF1A in cancer cells, the methylation
status of its promoter was included in the analyses. The
methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was determined
by MSP in 87 sarcomas from this cohort (12). Seventeen of the
tumors were shown to contain hypermethylation of the promoter. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
tumor-speciﬁc survival in all 87 patients when those patients
with RASSF1A promoter methylation were compared with
those without. Similarly to the associations with the genotypes
of RASSF1 c.397G>T, when segregated by sex, the 6 male
patients whose sarcomas contained a hypermethylated promoter displayed signiﬁcantly shorter mean survival times

9.69 was observed for male patients whose sarcomas

of the RASSF1A-p.133Ser isoform as similar trends were
observed in those 69 patients homozygous for the G allele

RASSF1 c.397G>T is associated with increased incidence

The results reported above support a model whereby
RASSF1 c.397G>T affects the p53/p73 cellular responses, leading to decreased survival rates. However, as p53 and p73
signaling is also crucial in tumor suppression, we decided to
explore the effect of RASSF1 c.397G>T on the age-dependent
incidence of STS in these patients. Studies showed that
patients carrying at least one copy of the minor allele were
diagnosed on average 8.8 years earlier than patients G/G in
genotype (48.6 vs. 57.4 years, P ¼ 0.0851, Table 2). Interestingly,
similar to the survival analyses, this difference in age at
diagnosis was greatly increased when the analysis was segregated by gender, with males carrying the minor T allele being
diagnosed on average 22.2 years earlier than those G/G in
genotype (33.7 vs. 55.9 years, P ¼ 0.0098, Table 2 and Fig. 5). By
contrast, as with the survival analyses, no signiﬁcant differences in age at diagnosis were observed in female patients (59.8

RASSF1A SNP and STS Survival

RASSF1A-p.133Ser, is predicted to have an altered secondary
structure surrounding the ATM site, compared with RASSF1Ap.133Ala. In line with the variation in structure, we observe that
RASSF1A-p.133Ser fails to be engaged by ATM and is concomitantly not phosphorylated upon DNA damage (Fig. 1A and B).
This suggested that the downstream effects of RASSF1A in
response to DNA damage might be impaired, and we show that
this is indeed the case. Interestingly, a previous report had
shown that inactivation of the ATM phosphorylation site in
RASSF1A (Ser131Phe or Ala133Ser) led to lower steady-state
phosphorylation at Ser203 (40). It has been reported that
RASSF1A function is dependent on phosphorylation of
RASSF1A-Ser203 and that elimination of this phosphorylation
site abrogates its ability to regulate cytokinesis, microtubule
stability, and cell-cycle progression (40–43). This raises the
possibility that phosphorylation at Ser131 may be a prerequisite for complete phosphorylation at Ser203 and concomitantly
effective RASSF1A tumor suppression. Therefore, in the case of
RASSF1A-p.133Ser, defective phosphorylation at Ser131 would
lead to impaired RASSF1A function.
We have previously reported that ATM/RASSF1A promotes
a robust p73 response in response to DNA damage (15). We
now ﬁnd that the minor allele variant, RASSF1A-p.133Ser, is
unable to elicit a similar response (Fig. 1D) and that this is likely
through the impaired activation of MST/LATS signaling (Fig.
1C–H). Apart from p73, we ﬁnd that RASSF1A-p.133Ser also has
an effect on the stabilization and activation of p53 (Fig. 3). In
line with previous reports highlighting RASSF1A/Daxx control
of MDM2 activity (16), introduction of RASSF1A-p.133Ala leads
to an increased stability of p53 in response to DNA damage
(Fig. 3B). However, this stabilization is attenuated in the
presence of RASSF1A-p.133Ser, resulting in reduced expression
of the p53 target gene p21 (Fig. 3B). In addition, the reduced p53
activation could also be due to the impaired ability of
RASSF1A-p.133Ser to activate MST1/2, which would impact
on both SIRT1-directed p53 deacetylation (17) and LATS1/2mediated control of MDM2 activation (18, 19).
Taken together, these observations support the idea that
RASSF1 c.397G>T results in the loss or impairment of a
major tumor suppressor pathway in cells (4, 7, 10, 11, 24). In
survival studies of STS patients, the minor allele associated
with poorer survival with a signiﬁcant RR of tumor-related
death (50.5 vs. 100.9 months, P ¼ 0.016; RR ¼ 4.82, P ¼
0.034, Table 1) in males. Interestingly, the RR of tumorrelated death was signiﬁcantly higher in a subset of male STS
patients that had been treated with radio/chemotherapy,
suggesting an association of the SNP with therapeutic outcome following DNA damaging treatment (RR ¼ 12.75, P ¼
0.031, Table 1). Although the sample size of patients carrying
the minor allele is low, our results suggest that RASSF1
c.397G>T deserves further validation in larger cohorts to
determine its usefulness as a prognostic indicator for survival in STS patients.
Our studies also show that male STS patients carrying at
least one copy of the minor allele were diagnosed at a significantly earlier age than their wild-type counterparts (33.7 vs.
55.9 years, P ¼ 0.0098, Table 2), suggesting an association
between the SNP and age of disease onset. Further validation of

www.aacrjournals.org

these associations in additional STS cohorts are necessary and
it would be of interest to determine whether these differences
in the age of onset could ultimately translate into an overall
increased risk for STS development in case–control studies
designed to estimate risk. However, these ﬁndings are in
agreement with a previous report suggesting an association
between RASSF1 c.397G>T and early-onset breast cancer in
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (24). Interestingly, no correlation
was found in a subsequent study (44), indicating that additional factors may be required for the early-onset phenotype in
breast cancer. An intrinsic failure to respond to endogenous
DNA damage stemming from cellular respiration, environmental radiation, or defective DNA repair (such as BRCA1/2
inactivation) leads to increased genomic instability and susceptibility to cancer (45). In the case of RASSF1 c.397G>T, a
defective response to endogenous DNA damage and impaired
p53/p73 tumor suppressive activity would precipitate tumorigenesis at an earlier age, which would be exacerbated by
higher levels of genomic instability in BRCA1/2 mutation
carriers.
Interestingly, we and others have previously shown that
inactivation of RASSF1A signaling by methylation associates
with poorer survival in a number of tumor types including STS
(7–12). In this article, we go on to provide evidence in a cohort
of STS patients that this association is sex speciﬁc, whereby
hypermethylation of the RASSF1A promoter in tumors only
associates with poorer survival in males. These observations
are dramatically similar to our observations for the differing
genotypes at the RASSF1 c.397G>T locus, whereby expression
of the isoform with weaker RASSF1 signaling associates with
poorer survival in males but not in females. We also only
observed the association of RASSF1 c.397G>T with the onset of
STS in the male patients (Fig. 5). A male sex bias had also
previously been reported for the association of RASSF1
c.397G>T with lung adenocarcinoma risk in a Japanese population (25). Taken together, it is tempting to speculate that in
some tissues and cancers, males could be more sensitive to
reduction of RASSF1 signaling either by epigenetic silencing or
the inherited predisposition of RASSF1A-p.133Ser.
The association of sex and risk has been observed in various
cancer types (46–48) and is thought to be due to the effect of
sex-speciﬁc hormones. The involvement of androgen receptors
in STS has been reported (49), raising the possibility that malespeciﬁc hormones might play a role in the ability of the SNP to
affect the age of onset, survival, and response to treatment in
male patients. Interestingly, previous studies suggest that MST
kinases are negatively regulated by androgen receptor (AR)
signaling to AKT (50). As AR signaling is stimulated by the
primarily male hormone androgen, MST signaling may be
inherently weakened and therefore limiting in males and the
pathway may be more sensitive to changes in upstream
activating signals, such as RASSF1A activity. The failure to
activate RASSF1A p.133Ser in response to DNA damage may
combine with AR-mediated inhibition of MST to ablate residual pathway activity in male patients, explaining the sexspeciﬁc clinical manifestation of RASSF1A activity either
through epigenetic silencing or the inherited predisposition
of RASSF1A-p.133Ser. It would be of interest to further evaluate

the potential of RASSF1 c.397G>T as a biomarker for identifying male subgroups that may beneﬁt from cancer surveillance at an earlier age or alternative therapeutic interventions.
In conclusion, we have shown that RASSF1 c.397G>T has a
profound effect on the ability of RASSF1A to respond to a DNA
damage signal and to mediate its tumor suppressive effects. We
show for the ﬁrst time an association of RASSF1 c.397G>T with
poor survival outcome and earlier onset of disease in male STS
patients. Further validation of these associations in additional
STS cohorts as well as additional tumor sites will assist in
determining the extent of RASSF1 c.397G>T usefulness as a
prognostic indicator for overall survival as well as therapeutic
response, and as a biomarker for early screening for male
patients more at risk for STS.
