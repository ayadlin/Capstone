Abstract

Author Manuscript

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an essential mammalian enzyme that couples metabolic status to
the regulation of a wide variety of cellular signaling pathways by acting as a nutrient sensor1.
OGT catalyzes the transfer of N-acetyl-glucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to serines and threonines
of cytoplasmic, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins2,3, including numerous transcription factors4,
tumor suppressors, kinases5, phosphatases1, and histone-modifying proteins6. Aberrant OGlcNAcylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance7, diabetic complications8, cancer9
and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s10. Despite the importance of OGT, the
details of how it recognizes and glycosylates its protein substrates are largely unknown. We report
here two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8 A) and a ternary
complex with UDP and a peptide substrate (1.95 A). The structures provide clues to the enzyme
mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique
domain between the two halves of the catalytic region. This information will accelerate the
rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT’s functions and the design of
inhibitors for use as cellular probes and to assess its potential as a therapeutic target.

The ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels is critical for the growth of all living
systems. In eukaryotes, a major mechanism for nutrient sensing involves the essential11
protein glycosyltransferase OGT, which senses cellular glucose levels via UDP-GlcNAc
concentrations, and responds by dynamically O-GlcNAcylating a wide range of nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins.1,12 These include proteins involved in insulin-like signaling
pathways7 and transcriptional activators that regulate glucose levels by controlling
gluconeogenesis13. Since many known O-GlcNAcylation sites are also phosphorylation
sites, OGT is proposed to play a major role in modulating cellular kinase signaling
cascades14. OGT is also involved in widespread transcriptional regulation15–17. Prolonged
hyperglycemia, such as occurs in diabetes, or excessive glucose uptake, such as occurs in
cancer cells, results in hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of cellular proteins by OGT, and this
increased O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to harmful cellular effects18. Thus, strategies to
modulate OGT activity may have therapeutic value for treating diabetic complications,
cancer, and other diseases13.

The lack of a crystal structure has been a major impediment to investigating OGT’s
molecular mechanisms, understanding substrate recognition, and developing inhibitors.
OGT comprises two distinct regions: an N-terminal region consisting of a series of
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) units19,20 and a multidomain catalytic region. The TPR
domain is proposed to scaffold interactions with other proteins, which may play a role in
determining substrate selectivity21. A crystal structure comprising 11.5 TPR units of human
OGT was reported in 200421, but there have been no structures of the catalytic region. From
sequence analysis and structures of bacterial glycosyltransferases22–26, including a bacterial
homolog of unknown function25,26, OGT was predicted to be a member of the GT-B
superfamily of glycosyltransferases (Gtfs)27. However, OGT is unusual because it is the
only known member to glycosylate polypeptides and it contains a long uncharacterized
intervening sequence (~120 amino acids) in the middle of the catalytic region. It is also
proposed to contain a phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) binding domain
involved in membrane recruitment in response to insulin signaling7.

Author Manuscript

We report two crystal structures of a human OGT construct (hOGT4.5) containing 4.5 TPR
units and the catalytic domain. The catalytic properties of this construct are similar to those
of the full-length enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 1)28. One structure (2.8 A, referred to as
OGT-UDP) is a complex with UDP; the other structure (1.95 A, referred to as OGT-UDPpeptide) is a complex containing UDP and a well-characterized 14 residue-CKII peptide
substrate28. Based on currently available experimental data, we also present a model for the
full-length enzyme (see Supplementary Information). Details of structure determination are
presented in Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
The OGT-UDP complex is shown in Fig. 1. The catalytic region contains three domains: the
N-terminal domain (N-Cat), the C-terminal domain (C-Cat), and the intervening domain
(Int-D) (Figs. 1a,b). The N-Cat and C-Cat domains have Rossmann-like folds typical of GTB superfamily members; however, the N-Cat domain is distinctive in containing two
additional helices, H1 and H2, which form an essential part of the active site (Fig. 1b). The
Int-D domain, which has a novel fold, packs exclusively against the C-Cat domain (Fig. 1c).

The UDP moiety binds in a pocket in the C-Cat domain near the interface with the N-Cat
domain27. This pocket is lined with conserved residues shown to be important for catalytic
activity (Supplementary Table 3)25,26. A transitional helix (H3) links the catalytic region to
the TPR repeats, which spiral along the upper surface of the catalytic region from the C-Cat
domain to the N-Cat domain. The TPRs and the catalytic region are demarcated by a narrow
horizontal cleft.

Author Manuscript

The OGT-UDP-peptide complex (Fig. 2), which crystallized in a different space group from
the OGT-UDP complex, has a wider cleft between the TPR domain and the catalytic region
than the OGT-UDP complex (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2a), and the CKII peptide binds in this cleft.
This peptide, YPGGSTPVS*SANMM, contains three serines and a threonine, but only one
serine (underlined; referred to as Ser*) is glycosylated by OGT28. The hydroxyl of Ser*
points into the nucleotide-sugar binding site (Fig. 2b). The two residues N-terminal to Ser*
lie over the UDP moiety; the residues C-terminal to Ser* traverse towards the back of the
cleft along the H2 helix of the N-Cat lobe. Although OGT glycosylates a wide range of
target peptides, it prefers sequences in which the residues flanking the glycosylated amino
acid enforce an extended conformation (e.g., prolines and β-branched amino acids; see
Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4). Consistent with these preferences, the
peptide is anchored mainly by contacts from OGT side chains to the amide backbone, with
an additional contact from the UDP moiety to the backbone amide of Ser*. The cleft is also
filled with ordered water molecules, enabling it to serve as an adaptable interface to bind a
range of polypeptides containing side chains of different sizes and hydrogen bond
properties. Since the peptide substrate is anchored by contacts to its backbone, it is
reasonable to infer that protein substrates are glycosylated on flexible regions such as loops
or termini that can bind in an extended conformation, exposing the amide backbone.

The closed conformation of the substrate-binding cleft in the OGT-UDP structure is
stabilized by a ‘latch’ comprising contacts between TPRs 10/11 and the H2 helix of the
catalytic domain (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). Opening of the cleft in the OGT-UDPpeptide complex occurs due to a hinge-like motion around a pivot point between TPRs 12
and 13. The two structures suggest that glycosylation substrates enter the active site from the
face of the enzyme shown in Fig. 2a, with the TPR domain restricting or allowing access
depending on its conformation and its interactions with the catalytic domain. Molecular
dynamics simulations indicate that the ‘hinge’ between the catalytic domain and the TPR
domain is capable of large motions that fully expose the active site, which would allow
protein substrates to approach closely enough for surface loops to enter (Supplemental
Movie 1). The molecular mechanisms that facilitate or stabilize opening of the cleft to allow
access of protein substrates remain to be determined, but may involve interactions between
protein substrates or adapter proteins and the other regions of OGT.
The OGT-UDP-peptide complex, in addition to revealing how peptide substrates bind,
provides unexpected insights into the kinetic mechanism. OGT was previously proposed to
have a random sequential bi-bi mechanism.28 The structure, however, indicates that the
peptide substrate binds over the nucleotide-sugar binding pocket, blocking access to it.
Moreover, the α-phosphate of the UDP moiety contacts the backbone amide of Ser* (Fig.
2c), which helps orient the peptide. The peptide complex suggests an ordered mechanism in

which UDP-GlcNAc binds prior to the polypeptide substrate. To assess the order of
substrate binding, we analyzed the product inhibition patterns for UDP. At saturating
peptide concentrations, a competitive inhibition pattern was obtained for UDP with respect
to UDP-GlcNAc, which is inconsistent with a random mechanism, but supports the ordered
sequential bi-bi mechanism implied by the crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

Another insight from the crystal structure is the identity of the catalytic base. Based on
analyses of other GT-B family members, including the bacterial OGT homolog, it was
proposed that His558 is the catalytic base. Although we have verified that this residue is
critical for catalytic activity, the peptide complex shows that it is more than 5 A away from
the reactive serine hydroxyl and makes an apparent hydrogen bond with the backbone
carbonyl of the preceding residue. In contrast, His498, which is invariant in metazoan OGTs
but absent in the homologous bacterial enzyme, protrudes from helix H1 into the active site
within 3.5 A of the Ser* hydroxyl. Since His498 is critical for activity and is located
between the reactive serine hydroxyl and the GlcNAc binding pocket, it is the probable
catalytic base in OGT.

Author Manuscript

We were unable to obtain a crystal of the OGT-UDP-GlcNAc complex due to hydrolysis of
the substrate, but according to computational docking experiments the GlcNAc is oriented in
a manner that exposes its β face to the overlying peptide (Supplementary Fig. 5) and places
the anomeric carbon near the reactive serine. This conformation is similar to the UDPGlcNAc conformation observed in a complex of another GT-B family member23, and its
relevance is supported by evidence that the C2 N-acetyl moiety projects up from the OGT
sugar binding pocket29. Furthermore, it is consistent with the enzymatic reaction, which
involves displacement of the α-UDP group to yield an inverted product. Based on the
accumulated biochemical and structural data, we propose a general mechanism for the
reaction (Fig. 2d).

Author Manuscript

The most unusual feature of OGT is the intervening domain between the catalytic lobes,
which is only found in metazoans (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). This polypeptide adopts a
topologically novel fold with a seven-stranded beta sheet core stabilized by flanking alpha
helices (Fig. 3a). There are two long unstructured loops for which electron density is
missing. An electrostatic surface rendering shows that the intervening domain and an
adjacent helix of the C-Cat domain form a large basic surface comprising ten lysine residues
(Figs. 3a and 3b), including K981 and K982, which were previously reported to constitute
part of a PIP3 binding motif that recruits OGT to membranes7. We mutated eight of these
ten lysines in various combinations (Supplementary Table 3). All mutants were catalytically
active (Supplementary Figure 8), but we were unable to identify a role for the Int-D domain
in PIP binding (Supplementary Table 5). We suggest this domain is involved in other
functions in vivo. These functions may include substrate selection, cellular localization, or
interactions with regulatory factors or receptors. The reported structures and mutant data
provide a crucial starting point for investigating the possible roles of the intervening domain.
The structures reported here show how OGT recognizes peptide sequences and provide new
information on the enzymatic mechanism as well as a view of the intervening domain.

structures and MD simulations, highlight the conformational changes that may regulate
access of substrates to the active site (Figs. 3c and d). Our structures may assist in the
development of inhibitors with possible therapeutic value for treating diseases associated
with excessive O-GlcNAcylation.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Human OGT residues 313-1031 (CPTH…KPVE) was expressed in E. coli and purified by
nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Protein was then incubated with UDP or
UDP and a 17-residue substrate peptide (KKKYPGGSTPVSSANMM), which was cleaved
to YPGGSTPVSSANMM in the crystallization drop (confirmed by mass spectrometry). The
OGT-UDP structure was determined using MIRAS (Supplementary Table 2). The OGTUDP-peptide complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined
OGT-UDP structure. The crystal packing for the two complexes is described in
Supplementary Fig. 9. Kinetic analysis was performed using UDP-14C-GlcNAc and a lysine
tagged CKII peptide using our previously described filter binding assay29. The molecular
dynamics simulation was performed by using the program Desmond30 on an optimized 64node Linux-based Infiniband cluster.
