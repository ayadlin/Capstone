ABSTRACT
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only kills tumor cells directly but also rapidly
recruits and activates immune cells favoring the development of antitumor adaptive
immunity. It is believed that Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid mediated photodynamic
therapy (ALA-PDT) can induce anti-tumor immune responses through dangerous
signals damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In this study, we investigated
the effect of ALA-PDT induced DAMPs on immune cells. We focused on the stimulation
of dendritic cells by major DAMPs, enhanced the expression of calreticulin (CRT), heat
shock proteins 70 (HSP70), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), either individually
or in combination. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo expressions of DAMPs induced
by ALA-PDT using immunohistochemistry, western blot, and ELISA in a squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) mouse model. The role of DAMPs in the maturation of DCs
potentiated by ALA-PDT-treated tumor cells was detected by FACS and ELISA. Our
results showed that ALA-PDT enhanced the expression of CRT, HSP70, and HMGB1.
These induced DAMPs played an important part in activating DCs by PDT-treated tumor
cells, including phenotypic maturation (increase of surface expression of MHC-II,
CD80, and CD86) and functional maturation (enhanced capability to secrete IFN-γ and
IL-12). Furthermore, injecting ALA-PDT-treated tumor cells into naïve mice resulted
in complete protection against cancer cells of the same origin. Our findings indicate
that ALA-PDT can increase DAMPs and enhance tumor immunogenicity, providing a
promising strategy for inducing a systemic anticancer immune response.

(DAMPs) [2]. Thus, these treatments are capable of not only
directly killing cancer cells via intrinsic cytotoxicity, but also
converting dying cancer cells into an anticancer vaccine.
Furthermore, they generate a specific immune response
against residual cancer cells and metastatic cells [4].
ICD depends on danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immune cells
for the generation of specific antitumor immunity [4].
DAMPs are molecules normally confined within live
cells in subcellular compartments such as nucleus,
cytosol, or biological membranes. As DAMPs are

INTRODUCTION
Recently it has been discovered that some anticancer
treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and
photodynamic therapy (PDT), kill cancer cells in an
immunogenic fashion, thereby secondarily stimulating
the immune system [1–2]. They can induce a form of
programmed cancer cell death called immunogenic cell
death (ICD) [3]. ICD is apoptotic in nature of its execution
is immunogenic since it is accompanied with emission of
dangerous signals damage-associated molecular patterns

exposed and secreted by stressed/damaged/dying cells,
they tend to acquire immunostimulatory capability [5–6].
DAMPs have the ability to activate immune cells like
macrophages, certain T cells, NK cells, and dendritic
cells (DCs) [7–8]. They also assist in opsonization and/
or phagocytosis of cancer cells [9–10], activation of
inflammasome and transcription of inflammatory gene
programs in immune cells [11], and processing and
presentation of proper tumor-associated antigens (TAA)
[8]. Three major DAMPs, calreticulin (CRT), heat shock
proteins 70 (HSP70), and high mobility group box 1
(HMGB1), have been identified [12]. The combination of
these major DAMPs has been found to be associated with
ICD induction [13].
Under physiological conditions, CRT is located
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in
chaperone-related functions as well as alcium homeostasis
and signaling [12]. The precursor of apoptosis is the
translocation of CRT to the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane induced by therapy-mediated stress in the
ER [14–15]. When CRT externalizes to the cell surface,
they acts as an “eat me” signal for phagocytes, mostly
DCs and macrophages, through their CD91 receptor [16].
Eventually, this leads to presentation of tumor antigens by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activation of T cells.
Owing to their widespread association with
apoptotic cell death, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are
called seasoned apoptotic DAMPs [6]. As highly
conserved chaperones, HSPs be of great benefit to in
structural folding of both newly synthesized as well as
stress-modified protein [17]. Elevated expression of
HSP70, either on the cell membrane or in extracellular
space can be immunostimulatory. Photofrin-PDT could
induce HSP70 translocation to the outer leaflet of plasma
membrane of cancer cells [18]. Membrane (outer leaflet)
association of HSPs has attracted special attention,
because of their ability to activate innate immunity cells
like DCs and NK cells [6]. Extracellular release of HSPs
has been found to be capable of stimulating migration and
maturation of DCs (upregulation of MHC class II, CD80,
CD86, CD83, and CD40 molecules) as well as activation
of NK cells [19].
Under normal conditions, HMGB1 protein acts as a
DNA chaperone that modulates the transcriptional activity
of various proteins, such as steroid hormone receptors,
p53, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [20]. Moreover,
HMGB1 facilitates recombination and participates
in chromatin-level transcriptional regulation [20].
Interestingly, extracellular HMGB1 has been reported
to be vital for the immunogenicity of ICD. CT26 murine
colon adenocarcinoma cell line treated with chemotherapy
and radiotherapy has been used as a prophylactic tumor
vaccine [21]. However, it was observed that ability of mice
to resist rechallenge was comprised when the mice were
immunized with HMGB1-depleted CT26 cancer cells or

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by co-injection of HMGB1-specific antibody [21]. It has
been reported for some time that large amount of HMGB1
as a DAMPs can be passively released by necrotic cells
[6, 21]. In the context of ICD, HMGB1 stimulates the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF,
IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, from innate immune cells like
neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages [21].
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a multistep procedure involving the selective uptake of a
photosensitiser by the tumor tissue, followed by
illumination of the neoplastic lesion with a light of
appropriate wavelength able to trigger photochemical
reactions that lead to tumor destruction [22]. Topical
5-aminolevulinic acid mediated PDT (ALA-PDT) is
an established treatment for actinic keratosis, Bowen’s
Disease, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and other
cancerous and precancerous skin diseases. PDT not
only kills tumor cells directly but also rapidly recruits
and activates immune cells favoring the development
of antitumor adaptive immunity [23]. In recent reports
[24–25], hypericin-based PDT (hyp-PDT) induced
immunogenic apoptosis characterized by phenotypic
maturation and functional stimulation of DCs as well as
induction of a protective antitumor immune response [24].
In our recent study, we observed that
ALA-PDT-treated tumor cells could induce maturations
of DCs, including morphology maturation (enlargement
of dendrites and increase of lysosomes), phenotypic
maturation (MHC-IIhigh , DC80high, and CD86high), and
functional maturation (IFN-γhigh and IL-12high, and to
induce T cell proliferation). Our results indicate that ALAPDT can induce immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells,
and can be more effective in enhancing immunogenicity
of tumor cells [26].
In this study, we investigated the effect of ALAPDT induced DAMPs on immune cells. We focused on
the stimulation of DCs by major DAMPs, enhanced the
expression of calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins 70
(HSP70), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), either
individually or in combination.

RESULTS
Induction of SCC tumors in mice
Continued UV irradiation on SKH-1 mice
lasted for 4 months until needle-size papules began to
appear. Then SCC tumors continued to grow without
irradiation. One month after stopping irradiation,
multiple tumors became palpable and some tumors
began to develop surface erosion and ulcers, as shown in
Figure 1A. Hematoxylin/eosin stain was used to identify
characteristic pathological changes of SCCs (Figure 1).
Some neoplastic cells were in mitosis and others were
dyskeratotic or necrotic, and a large number of atypical

tissue were observed (Figure 1B and 1C).

and noticeably decreased after 9 h (Figure 3B). HMGB1
expression increased 1 h after treatment, reached a peak at
6 h, and started decreasing at 9 h (Figure 3C). ALA-PDT
increased HSP70 expression of PECA cells between 3 and
6 h after treatment, as shown in Figure 3D.

In situ immunogenic SCC cell death induced by
ALA-PDT treatment

Exposure of CRT and HSP70 on tumor cell
surface induced by ALA-PDT

To investigate the induced antitumor immune
responses, the UV-induced SCC tumors in mice were
treated by ALA-PDT. Histological examination of
tissue taken from treated tumor sites was performed 0 to
12 h after ALA-PDT. Untreated tumor tissue was used
for comparison. Immunohistochemistry was employed
to observe expression of CRT, HSP70, and HMGB1 in
treated tumors . As shown in Figure 2, positive staining
for HSP70 was observed 3 h and 6 h after ALA-PDT and
noticeable reduction of HSP70 expression was seen 9 h
after treatment. HMGB1 expression markedly increased
1 h after ALA-PDT (Figure 2), compared with untreated
tumor tissue, and reached a peak at 6 h before beginning
to decline. Similarly, CRT expression on tumor tissue
increased considerably between 0 to 9 h after ALA-PDT
(Figure 2), before declining. It is worth noting that the
cells mainly underwent apoptosis, as observed in our
previous studies [27].

HSP70 and CRT exposure on the surface of PECA
cells was analyzed by western blot at different time points
after ALA-PDT (0.25J/cm2, 0.5J/cm2, 1J/cm2). CRT and
HSP70 expressions on surface of PECA cells increased
as a function of light dose (Figure 4A, 4C). Exposures
of CRT and HSP70 on the cell surface reached the peak
values at 6 h after ALA-PDT before beginning to decline
(Figure 4B, 4D).

Secretion of HMGB1 and HSP70 induced by
ALA-PDT treatment
HMGB1 and HSP70 releases were measured by
ELISA in the supernatants of PECA cell culture between
1 h to 12 h after ALA-PDT treatment (0.5J/cm2, 1J/cm2,
2J/cm2). As show in Figure 5A–5C, PECA cells began to
release HMGB1 1 h after treatment and HMGB1 reached
a peak value 6 h after treatment. As shown in Figure 5D,
6 h after treatment, ALA-PDT of all light doses induced
significant release of HMGB1, although the difference
between 0.5J/cm2 and 1J/cm2 was not significant. HSP70
secretion from PECA significantly increased 3 h after ALAPDT treatment (0.5J/cm2), compared with the untreated
cells, and significantly dropped at 12 h (p < 0.01) (Figure
6A). As show in Figure 6B, 6C, HSP70 reached a peak
value 6 h after ALA-PDT treatment (1J/cm2, 2J/cm2).

Expression of intracellular CRT, HSP70, and
HMGB1 induced by ALA-PDT treatment
To determine ALA-PDT induced intracellular
DAMPs, expressions of CRT, HSP70, and
HMGB1 of PECA cells treated by ALA-PDT
(0.25J/cm2, 0.5J/cm2, 1J/cm2) were analyzed by western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, expression of CRT
was the highest at 0.5J/cm2. At 0.5J/cm2, CRT expression
markedly increased between 1 h to 6 h after treatment

However, there is no significant difference in HSP70 release
between cells treated at 0.5J/cm2 or 1J/cm2 (Figure 6D).

IL-12 at a level markedly higher than that by untreated
cells (p < 0.05). When HSP70, HMGB1 and CRT were
blocked individually, or in combination, IFN-γ secreted
from DCs reduced significantly (p < 0.05). When
blocking agents for CRT, HSP70, and HMGB1 were
used individually, IL-12 dropped slightly; however,
blocking all three DAMPs resulted in significant
reduction of IL-12 (p < 0.05).

Effect of DAMPs on phenotypic maturation of
DCs
The role of DAMPs in phenotypic maturation of
DCs simulated by PDT-treated PECA cells was determined
by blocking CRT, HSP70, and HMGB1 during coincubation of PDT-treated PECA cells and imDCs for 24
h. Neutralizing antibodies of HSP70, HMBG1, and CRT
were used either individually or in combination. Untreated
imDCs were used as negative control and imDCs stimulated
by LPS were used as positive control. Flow cytometric
analysis showed that the expressions of CD80, CD86, and
MHC-II molecules on the surface of DCs stimulated by
PDT-treated cells increased significantly compared with
controls, as shown in Figure 7. When HSP70, HMGB1, and
CRT were blocked individually, the activation of DCs was
suppressed; however, blocking all three DAMPs resulted in
the least DC activation (Figure 7).

Antitumor immunity in mice induced by
ALA-PDT-treated SCC cells
We immunized naïve SKH-1 mice with ALA-PDTtreated SCC cells, which were collected from tumor-bearing
SKH-1 mice. After the immunization was performed three
times, the mice were challenged with viable SCC cells.
Forty-two days after injection with viable SCC cells, no
tumors were observed in the immunized mice, while all
control mice experienced tumor growth (Figure 9).

DISCUSSION

Effect of DAMPs on functional maturation of
DCs

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a
common human skin cancer in elderly patients and its
incidence has been on the rise due to the increasing life
expectancy [28]. The lesions are often located on the
head, the face, and the vulva, and the external genitalia.
For SCCs of large size or at vulnerable sites, traditional

The functional state of DCs incubated with ALAPDT-treated PECA cells was analyzed for the presence
of IFN-γ and IL-12 using ELISA assay. As shown in
Figure 8, ALA-PDT-the treated cells secreted IFN-γ and

after ALA-PDT, reaching their peak values at 6 h.

treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, cryotherapy,
and radiotherapy, were unsatisfactory. Such treatments
have certain disadvantages, including destruction of
normal tissue structure and function, dose limitation, and
high rate of recurrence [29].
Poorly immunogenic tumor cells often lead to
metastasis and recurrence. To effectively treat poorly
immunogenic cancers, stimulating the immune system,
particularly enhancing the immunogenicity of the tumor
cells, is believed to be a winning strategy.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is effective for the
treatment of cutaneous cancers [30–32]. Our recent study
indicated that tumor cells treated by ALA-DPT stimulated
phenotypic maturation (MHCIIhigh, CD80high, CD86high) and
functional stimulation (INF-γhigh, IL-12high, IL-10low and to
induce T cell proliferation) of DCs [26]. In this study, we
further investigated the effect of ALA-PDT on inducing
DAMPs and stimulating DCs, leading to tumor-specific
immune responses.
We established ultraviolet induced SCC in mice (Figure
1). Our previous study, we identify the death of SCC tumor
through apoptosis or necrosis pathway using TUNEL staining

[27]. We observed apoptosis cells start to reach a peak at 6
hours after ALA-PDT. Using the tumor tissue from the
tumor-bearing mice after ALA-PDT treatment, we observed
increased expressions of DAMPs induced by ALA-PDT, as
shown in Figure 2. Therefore, our results clearly demonstrated
the capability of PDT in inducing DAMPs in vivo.
The induction of DAMPs by ALA-PDT was further
supported by our findings in in vitro study. While the
primary skin tumor model induced by UV in SKH-1 mice
was a general cutaneous SCC animal model, similar to
the primary SCC tumors in human, PECA tumor cells is a
cutaneous SCC cell line of mice, which have the biological
characteristics of SCC. Therefore, we used PECA tumor
cells to study the mechanism of PDT induced DAMPs.
As shown in Figure 3, expressions of intracellular CRT,
HMGB1, and HSP70 of PECA cells increased after
ALA-PDT, depending on the light dose. Furthermore, we
investigated exposures of CRT and HSP70 on the surface
of ALA-PDT-treated PECA cells. Exposure of CRT
increased as a function of the light dose, and reached a
peak value 6 h after ALA-PDT (Figure 4A, 4B). Exposure
of CRT on surface of dying cancer cells is critical for ICD

[33]. In a recent report, the externally added recombinant
CRT boosted antitumor response elicited by PDT or
PDT-generated vaccines [34].
Our data revealed that ALA-PDT was capable of
exposing HSP70 on the plasma membrane of tumor cells
increased with light dose; the exposure of HSP70 was
the highest 6 h after ALA-PDT treatment (Figure 4C,
4D). Membranal HSPs can stimulate DCs and NK cells
to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and process/react
to tumor antigens [6]. As seasoned apoptotic DAMPs,
HSP70 could also be secreted from PDT-treated tumor
cells. As shown in Figure 6, ALA-PDT of all light doses
induced significant release of HSP70 6 h after treatment.
Extracellular release of HSPs could be complexed
to tumor-associated peptides or antigens. Then these
HSP-peptide complexes could be taken up by APCs,
and presented to and activate T lymphocytes, initiating
adaptive immune response [35].
We also demonstrated that ALA-PDT induced
extracellular release of HMGB1 in a dose dependent
manner; the expression of HMGB1 reached a peak value
6 h after ALA-PDT (Figure 5). Extracellular HMGB1
activates macrophages and DCs, and recruits neutrophil
though a range of receptors, including TLR2, TLR4, and
RAGE [36–38]. HMGB1 as DAMPs has been widely

demonstrated in necrotic cancer cells [21]. Recently,
apoptotic cancer cells were also shown to release
HMGB1 at some points in the irrespective execution
phases [39].
Significant increase in expression of all three
DAMPs of PECA cells was observed after the treatment by
ALA-PDT at 0.5J/cm2 as compared with untreated tumor
cells. It has been proposed that apoptotic tumor cells can
induce more effective antitumor immune responses than
necrotic tumor cells [40–41]. Our previous study showed
that ALA-PDT at 0.5J/cm2 induced maximum number
of apoptotic cells, while ALA-PDT at 2J/cm2 resulted in
most necrotic cells [26]. Moreover, expression of the three
DAMPs reached a peak value 6 h after ALA-PDT. Thus,
we used the dose of 0.5J/cm2 and post-treatment period of
6 h as the optimal parameters of ALA-PDT for most of our
experiments in the present study.
DCs are the major link between the innate and
adaptive immune responses. DCs can exhibit various
states and perform different functions [42]. Tumor
cells undergoing ICD can promote maturation of DCs.
These mature DCs are capable of presenting antigen to
and priming the adaptive immune cells. The distinction
between immature and mature DCs lies in the changes in
their phenotypic level and functional level [42].

Figure 9: (Continued) Tumor growth in SKH-1 mice after implantation of SCC tumor cells. G. showed tumor growth
curves of different groups.

In the present study, tumor cells treated by ALADPT stimulated phenotypic maturation (MHCIIhigh,
CD80high, CD86high). When HSP70, HMGB1, and CRT
were blocked individually, expressions of CD80, CD86,
and MHC-II of DCs were negatively affected, while
blocking all three DAMPs resulted in the least DC
activation (Figure 7). Our results suggest that HSP70,
HMGB1, and CRT, particularly in combination, are
important to stimulate phenotypic maturation of DCs by
ALA-PDT-treated tumor cells.
PDT-treated tumor cells also induced functional
stimulation (INF-γhigh, IL-12high) of DCs as shown in
Figure 8A. When blocking agents for CRT, HSP70,
and HMGB1 were used individually, IL-12 dropped
slightly; however, blocking all three DAMPs resulted
in significant reduction of IL-12 (p < 0.05), as shown in
Figure 8B. IFN-γ produced by mature DCs contributed to
Th1 polarization [43]. Th1-type cells were critical for the
optimal generation and durability of specific cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs) that promote antitumor immunity
[44–45]. Owing to the activation of CD8+T cells and
the inhibition of angiogenesis, IL-12 has been reported
consistently to have potent antitumor activity [46].
Our data demonstrate that HSP70, HMGB1, and CRT
significantly decrease the induction of IFN-γ and IL-12 in
DCs (Figure 8), hence being crucial for DCs maturation
and antitumor immune response.
In this study, the antitumor immunity of the ALAPDT-treated SCC cells was tested in SKH-1 mice. As
shown in Figure 9, ALA-PDT-treated SCC cells worked as
“tumor vaccines” in preventing SCC growth in immunized
mice. Protection against tumor growth at the challenge
site was a sign of anti-tumor immunity, established by the
activation of DCs through the induced DAMPs.
In conclusion, this study show that ALA-PDT
generated ICD, which triggers exposure of CRT and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HSP70 on the cell membrane, as well as releases of
HSP70 and HMGB1 to extracellular space. Our results
also support that DMAPs play a pivotal role in ALAPDT induced phenotypic maturation and functional
maturation of DCs. Furthermore, ALA-PDT-treated SCC
cells provided protection against cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma in mice. Our findings indicate that
ALA-PDT is capable of inducing DAMPs and enhancing
immunogenicity of SCC cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and cell lines
Male SKH-1 hairless mice (6–8 weeks old,
Jackson Laboratories), free of skin injuries, were used.
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the back
of mice was induced by solar-simulated ultraviolet
irradiation (Solar UV Simulator, SIGMA Shanghai,
China) as described previously [29]. SCC tumors were
excised from mice sacrificed and then enzymatically
disaggregated into single cell suspensions for
experiments. SCC cells were then washed in PBS and
maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Billings, MT,
USA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin antibiotics (Gibco) at 37°C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 [47–48].
SCC cell line PECA (CLS Cell Lines Service
GmbH, Eppelheim, German) was also used in this
study. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)

Chemicals and reagents

a membrane protein Extraction Kit (BOSTER, China).
PECA cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (Tris base 50 mM, NaCl
150 mM, NP40 1%, sodium deoxycholate 0.25%,
EDTA 1 mM) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The protein
concentration was measured using a BCA protein
assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts
of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamidegel
electrophoresis (PAGE) on 10% gels and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with
5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS [Tris-buf-fered saline (pH
7.4)] containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and then
incubated with primary antibodies (anti-HSP70, antiHMGB1 and anti-CRT antibody) overnight at 4°C. The
membranes were then washed three times (15 min each)
with TBST, and incubated with an alkaline phosphataseconjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room
temperature. The color reaction was developed using
NBT (p-nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride) and BCIP
(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate; Sigma).

RPMI 1640 cell culture medium, PBS, and
penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Hyclone
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Gibco
(Billings, MT, USA). ALA hydrochloride powder was
from Shanghai Fudan-Zhangjiang Bio-Pharmaceutical
Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China). Rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP70
and mouse monoclonal anti-HMGB1 (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin
(abcam, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH and
mouse monoclonal anti-FAS (Santa Cruz, USA) were
used. In addition, we used mouse HSP70 ELISA Kit
(ENEO, USA), mouse HMGB1 ELISA Kit (SHINOTEST, Japan), mouse IFN-γ and IL-12 ELISA Kit (Boster,
China), rabbit anti-Mouse CD80-PE, rabbit anti-Mouse
CD86-PE, rabbit anti-Mouse MHC-II-PE, and rat IgG2a
K Isotype Control PE (Biolegend, USA). Neutralizing
antibodies for CRT, HSP70, and HMGB1 were purchased
commercially (Santa Cruz, USA).

PDT treatment

Quantification of HMGB1 and HSP70 release

For in vitro study, SCC cells were incubated with
ALA (0.5 mM) in full serum-free medium for 5 h at 37°C,
then washed twice with PBS and exposed to the light
dose of 0.5 J/cm2 (632.8 nm, 10 mW/cm2). For in vivo
study, 8% ALA cream was topically applied onto tumor
surface for 3 h. Mice were irradiated by a helium-neon
laser (632.8 nm) at a power density of 100 mW/cm2 and
energy density of 15 J/cm2.

In order to evaluate release of HMGB1 in response
to ALA-PDT, PECA cells were cultured in six well tissue
culture plates, and treated with ALA-PDT with different
fluences (0.5J/cm2, 1J/cm2, 2J/cm2). After centrifugation,
the supernatants were collected and analyzed using
an ELISA-based HMGB1 and HSP70 detection
kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions, at
determined time points (0 to 12 h) after PDT treatment.

Immunohistochemical studies

Flow cytometric analysis of DCs

At designated time points (0 to 12 h) after treatment,
mice were sacrificed. Freshly isolated tissue was stored
in formalin and 5 μm sections were de-waxed (30 min
56°C, 2 × 10 min xylene), followed by rehydration,
antigen unmasking, and blocking. Then the samples were
stained with anti-HSP70, anti-HMGB1, and anti-CRT
primary antibodies at 1 μg/ml in blocking solution for 30
min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in PBS and
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(Boster, China) diluted in blocking solution for 30 min.
Slides were inculcated with strept avidin-biotin complex
(Boster, China) for 30 min, rinsed in PBS, and stained
using a DAB chromagen and hematoxylin counterstain,
and observed under a light microscope. PBS was used for
negative control sections.

Six hours after treatment, PECA cells without
treatment or treated by ALA-PDT (0.5 mM ALA, 0.5J/cm2)
were incubated with immature dendritic cells (imDCs), at
a ratio of 1:20 (imDCs:PECA) for 24 h. As block agents,
neutralizing antibodies of HSP70, HMBG1, and CRT were
used either individually, or in combination, during the coincubation with imDCs and PECA cells. Unstimulated
imDCs were used for negative control and LPS-treated
DCs (4μg/ml LPS for 24 h) were used for positive control.
The DCs were collected and then washed in PBS, followed
by incubation with the following antibodies: anti-mouse
CD80-PE, anti-mouse CD86-PE, and anti-mouse MHCII-PE for 40 min at 4°C in the dark. After incubation, the
cells were washed in PBS and analyzed with a FACS flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).

Western blot

Detection of cytokines from DCs

To determine ALA-PDT induced HSP70,
HMGB1, and CRT expression, membrane proteins of
ALA-PDT-treated PECA tumor cells were extracted with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To detect cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12) secreted from
DCs, imDCs were incubated with treated and untreated
44699

Oncotarget

PECA cells at a ratio of 1:20 (imDCs:PECA) in 24-well
tissue culture plates. Blocking agents for CRT, HSP70, and
HMGB1 were used either individually, or in combination,
during co-incubation. After 24 h, the supernatants were
collected and divided into different groups. The cytokines
(IFN-γ, IL-12) were determined by ELISA assay according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Immature DCs were used
for negative control and DCs incubated with 4μg/ml LPS
for 24 h were used for positive control.

SCC cells were treated by ALA-PDT (0.5 mM
ALA, 0.5 J/cm2). Six hours after treatment, cells were
collected, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in
PBS (for injection). To detect immune response induced
by ALA-PDT-treated SCC cells, female SKH-1 mice,
age 6–8 weeks were randomly divided into two groups
(10 per group). The mice were immunized by injecting
subcutaneously in the left flank with ALA-PDT treated
tumor cells (6 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml solution). Immunization
was performed three times with a 10-day interval. Mice in
control group were injected with 0.2 ml PBS. Mice were
then challenged with 1 × 106 viable SCC cells in the right
flank 7 days after the third immunization. Following the
challenge, the mice were monitored every day.
