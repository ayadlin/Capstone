ABSTRACT
The HuPrime® human gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma derived xenograft
model GA0087 was established in this study. GA0087 PDX model showed high gene
expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-A and B, and high potential
of lung metastasis. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with either large or small size,
circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) and lung metastatic lesions were detected
in GA0087 PDX mice. The number of CTC correlated to the number of metastatic
nodules in lung. Both primary tumor growth and metastasis in terms of the number
of dynamically monitored CTCs and metastatic nodules were effectively suppressed
by Cisplatin. Diverse subtypes of CTCs in the context of sensitivity to Cisplatin
were specifically identified by subtraction enrichment (SE) integrated with in situ
Phenotyping of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and Karyotyping of chromosome 8 (in situ PK
CTC by CK-iFISH). All the CK18-/diploid and majority of CK18+/diploid CTC subtypes
were chemosensitive, whereas a higher percentage of CK18+/multiploid subtype of
CTC were Cisplatin-insensitive. Combined histopathological examination of metastatic
lesion and in situ PK CTC in a metastatic PDX (mPDX) tumor model are of particular
significance, and may provide an unique and robust platform for cancer research as
well as pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of new anti-cancer drugs.

INTRODUCTION

primary tumors in cancer patients, PDX models closely
recapitulate the heterogeneity of patients’ primary tumors
and possess biological stability of gene-expression and
mutational status, etc. Such superiorities offer the promise
that PDX models will predict new anti-cancer drug
efficacy including both sensitivity as well as resistance
more reliably than cancer cell lines [7, 8]. However, PDX
model with high metastasizing potential has been reported
rarely.
Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and
metastasis and is controlled by angiogenic factors.
One of the important angiogenic factors is vascular

Gastric cancer (GC) leads to the 3rd cancerrelated mortality worldwide [1]. Overall 5-year survival
rate of GC patients is as low as only 20% due to either
chemoinsensitivity and/or early development of
chemoresistance of GC to therapeutic agents [2, 3].
Advantages of novel preclinical patient derived
xenograft (PDX) models over the traditional tumor animal
models established with cancer cell lines for development
of anti-cancer drugs have been reported [4-7]. Unlike cell

endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) produced by
tumor cells [9]. VEGF-A facilitates hyperpermeability and
macromolecular transvascular transport [10]. In particular,
it has been reported that VEGF-A expression correlates
with distant hematogenous metastases in gastric carcinoma
patients [11, 12].
The clinical significance of circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM, a
cluster of 2 or more CTCs) [13, 14] in tumor metastasis
of various cancer types [15] including gastric [16] and
lung [17] carcinomas has been documented elsewhere.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
has recently accepted quantification of CTC as a novel
breast cancer biomarker [18]. Currently, the conventional
CTC detection methodology relies on expression of both
EpCAM for isolation, and intracellular cytokeratins (CK)
for identification [19]. However, it has been recognized
that clinical application of such strategy could be
significantly limited due to highly heterogeneous and
dynamic expression of EpCAM among different cancer
cells [20, 21]. Moreover, down-regulation or loss of both
EpCAM and CK during epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a key process for generation and dissemination
of CTCs via the circulation, has been reported by others
[20-22]. In addition, because EpCAM-related intracellular
signaling pathways in cancer cells can be activated
following binding of anti-EpCAM to neoplastic cells, it is
not surprising that subsequent analysis of CTCs perturbed
by anti-EpCAM may result in post-isolation artifacts [20,
23, 24].
A novel combined cellular and molecular
approach of integrated subtraction enrichment (SE) and
immunostaining-FISH (i•FISH®) to detect and characterize
CTCs has recently been reported [16]. SE-i•FISH® is able
to enrich and detect different subtypes of CTC regardless
of caner types, CTC size variation [25] and CK or
EpCAM expression. Obtained CTCs, free from hypotonic
damage [26] and anti-EpCAM purturbing, are suitable
for primary tumor cell culture and a series of subsequent
studies including gene mutation analysis performed on the
individual CTC [27] as well as establishing tumorigenic
CTC- or CTC subtype-derived xenograft mouse models
(CDXs) which could mirror the donor patient’s response
to chemotherapy [28].
The HuPrime® PDX mouse model, GA0087, derived
from human gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma has been
successfully established in this study. The GA0087
model had a high gene expression of VEGF-A and B and
demonstrated a high metastasizing potential showing
both lung metastatic lesion in 88% of GA0087 mice, and
detectable CTC in 86% of those metastatic lesion positive
mice. Studies of dynamic status of CTCs demonstrated the
existence of hematogenous dissemination waves of CTC
(or “CTC waves”) in non-treated metastatic GA0087 PDX
mice. Both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis
in terms of the number of CTCs and metastatic nodules
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in lung were suppressed following administration of
chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. Moreover, in accordance
with our previous study demonstrating that chromosomal
aneuploidy in CTCs correlates to either intrinsic or the
acquired cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer patients
[16], different subtypes of CTC classified upon their
chromosome 8 ploidy and CK18 expression examined
by CK-i•FISH® were found to have distinct diverse
sensitivities to cisplatin in GA0087 PDX mice. Pre-clinical
therapeutic drug efficacy evaluated by the integrated
subtraction enrichment (SE)-i•FISH® on the additional
PDX models established from melanoma, colorectal, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular (HCC)
carcinoma patients are currently under our investigation.
In contrast to conventional measuring tumor
mass and enumerating metastatic nodules alone,
comprehensive characterization of metastasis performed
by the combined immuno-histopathological examination
of metastatic lesion and in situ phenotypic and karyotypic
characterization of CTC (in situ PK CTC) in a metastatic
PDX (mPDX) tumor model are of particular significance
for cancer research as well as development of new anticancer therapeutic strategies and agents.

RESULTS
Histopathological characterization and genomic
profiling of the metastatic HuPrime® PDX model
GA0087
Diagnosis of the donor patient’s primary gastric
neuroendocrine cancer was confirmed by histopathological
biopsy as shown in Figure 1A-a. Tumor was surgically
removed from the patient, and the small 3×3×3 mm3
freshly dissected tumor tissue was subcutaneously
(Sub-Q) engrafted on the immunocompromised nude
mice, followed by serial re-engraftings when each growth
reached 500-700 mm3 from P1 to P10. The tumor tissue
of GA0087 P8 revealed in Figure 1A-b was applied
for Sub-Q implantation on different mice in this study.
Metastatic lesions in the lung of GA0087 mice were
shown in Figure 1A-c, indicating that the established
GA0087 was an authentic metastatic PDX model.
As demonstrated in Figure 1B, subsequent gene
expression analysis performed on the frozen tissue cells
of mice indicated that cells in GA0087 mice particularly
had a high gene expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-B,
which were 2-3 times higher than other examined genes
including VEGF-C, TGFB1, ERBB1 and CXCR4.
Additional genetic and genomic profiling revealed
that gene of cells in GA0087 mice was wild type for
EGFR, ERK, BRAF, KRAS, PI3K, and c-MET (data not
shown).

in situ phenotypic and karyotypic identification
and characterization of CTCs by CK-iFISH

Cisplatin suppresses primary tumor growth and
extends survival time of GA0087 PDX mice

in situ PK CTCs and CTM enriched from 200 µl
of GA0087 murine blood was performed by CK-iFISH.
Mouse blood samples were subjected to subtraction
enrichment (SE). Enriched CTCs on the coated CTC
slides were hybridized with the human chromosome 8
centromere probe and immunostained with anti-CK18
antibody, followed by image acquiring and analysis.
Demonstrated in Figure 2A, a CTM consisting of diverse
subtypes of CTC including 2 large cells of CK18+/triploid,
3 small cells of CK18- respectively with monoploid,
diploid and triploid chromosome 8 was shown in a
vehicle control mouse. Figure 2B showed a CK18- CTM
consisting of small tumor cells observed in a vehicle
mouse. In cisplatin-treated GA0087 mice, large CK18+
triploid and multiploid (≥5 copies of chromosome 8)
CTCs were demonstrated in Figure 2C. A CTM consisting
of 2 diploid and 1 triploid tumor cells with heterogeneous
expression of CK18 was revealed in Figure 2D, 2 diploid
CTCs in this CTM were as small as mouse WBCs,
whereas the triploid CTC was large. Mouse WBCs were
negative for both anti-human CK18 staining and human
CEP8 iFISH.

Intravenous administration of cisplatin (treated
group) or 0.9% NaCl (vehicle group) was performed for
total of 5 times at the indicated time intervals (red arrows)
on 8 of randomly selected GA0087 PDX mice from each
group. Initial cisplatin treatment started on Day 27 since
subcutaneous (Sub-Q) implantation of tumor tissue on
Day 1. Cisplatin efficacy on primary tumor growth and
survival time was investigated on GA0087 mice. Figure
3A showed that tumor growth for the cisplatin treated
mice was 20 days delayed to reach the median tumor
growth value of 600 mm3 (grey dash line), compared to
that of the vehicle control group. The difference between
the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). At
the completion of the experiment on Day 76, the average
tumor size for cisplatin and vehicle group was 678 mm3
(initial = 238 mm3) and 1450 mm3 (initial = 235 mm3),
respectively. The T/C value = ∆T/∆C × 100% = (678238)/(1450-235) × 100% = 36%, P < 0.05, suggesting
that primary tumor growth in GA0087 PDX mice was
significantly suppressed by cisplatin.
Each vehicle and cisplatin treated group had 2 tumor
free-mice as a negative control. None of those negative

control mice was found to have primary tumor.
Results of Time-to-Event analysis (Event: the
medium tumor growth size of 600 mm3) performed by logrank (Mantel-Haenszel) test (Figure 3B) showed a hazard
ratio (HR) of 5.374 with 95% Confidence Interval (95%
CI) of 1.431-20.18. Survival analysis indicated a longer
survival time in cisplatin treated mice compared to that of
vehicle group, suggesting that cisplatin had an effective
anti-tumor activity in the established PDX model GA0087.

CTCs (8 cells) were still detected on Day 62 following 5
times administration of cisplatin initiated on Day 27. All
the CTCs were eventually eliminated in the treated mice
at the completion of the experiment on Day 76. Obtained
results indicated that majority of the disseminated tumor
cells were sensitive to cisplatin, but there were few
cisplatin-insensitive CTCs existed. Monitoring of CTCs
in non-treated vehicle mice showed existence of “CTC
waves” peaked at Day 22, 41 and 76, respectively.
Additional analysis was performed to further
quantitatively and statistically characterize CTCs in
vehicle and cisplatin treated mice. Revealed in Figure
4B/4C, total CTC numbers in 5 of CTC positive vehicle
mice was 150 (B, blue column, n = 5) with a median of 15
(Min 1, Max 22) as shown in Figure 4C. With respect to
those cisplatin treated mice, CTCs were detected in all of
7 mice, and total of 35 CTCs (B, red column, n = 7) with a
median of 1 (Min 0, Max 2.5) (Figure 4C) were identified.
The difference of total CTC numbers between the vehicle
and the treated group was statistically very significant
(**P < 0.01).
Quantitative and statistical analysis of metastatic
nodules shown in Figure 4D/4E demonstrated the total
number of metastatic nodules in 7 vehicle-mice was 113
(D, blue column, n = 7) with a median of 14 (Min 4,
Max 30) as revealed in Figure 4E. Total of 41 metastatic
nodules were identified in 7 treated-mice (D, red column,
n = 7) with a median of 2 (Min 1, Max 17) (Figure 4E).
The difference of metastatic nodule numbers between the
vehicle and treated group was statistically significant (*P
< 0.05).
Sperman Rank Test was performed to examine
if there was a correlation between CTC numbers and
metastatic nodule numbers. Demonstrated in Figure 4F,
the results of Spearman’s rho analysis showed (R2) = 0.709
with 95% CI of 0.2097 to 0.9152, P < 0.01, indicating
that there was a statistically very significant numerical
correlation between the lung metastatic nodule numbers
and the CK18+ CTC numbers in GA0087 PDX mice.
Obtained results indicated that metastases in terms
of the enumerated CTCs and metastatic nodules were
effectively suppressed by cisplatin in GA0087 PDX mice,

Cisplatin suppresses tumor metastases in PDX
mice
Cisplatin efficacy on metastases was quantitatively
examined on both CTC and lung metastatic lesion in 8
mice of each treated or vehicle group. The number of
CTC in cisplatin treated or vehicle GA0087 mice was
continuously enumerated during the study, and the lung
metastatic nodules were quantified at the completion of
the experiment on Day 76.
Histopathological examination showed that 7 out
of 8 mice in each treated or vehicle group developed
metastatic lesions in lung. Five out of those 7 lesion
positive vehicle-mice were found to have detectable
CTCs, whereas 7 out of those 7 lesion positive treatedmice were CTC positive. The mice, which didn’t show
metastatic lesion in each group (1 out of 8), were not
found CTC positive either. Neither metastatic lesion nor
CTC was observed in 2 of tumor free-negative control
mice in each vehicle and treated group.
Dynamic dissemination of CTC in both treated and
vehicle GA0087 mice was monitored and shown in Figure
4A. Two hundred µl of blood were serially collected from
Day 14 to Day 76 with a total of 9 collections, followed by
subjection to SE-iFISH for CTC detection. Administration
of cisplatin was performed at the indicated time intervals
(red arrows). Results of Figure 4A demonstrated that in
both treated and vehicle mice, CTCs could be detected
as early as 2 weeks since Sub-Q implantation on Day 1.
Comparing to CTCs in vehicle mice, the number of CTC
in the treated mice was significantly lower, whereas a few

multiploid with the majority of trisomy.
Additional detailed analysis of CTC subtypes with
diverse sensitivities to cisplatin was summarized in Table
1. Twenty three out of the 150 CTCs in vehicle mice were
CK18 negative, and they were diploid (15%, 23 out of
150 total CTCs). The remaining 127 CTCs were CK18
positive, including 114 diploid (76%, 114 out 150) and
13 multiploid (9%, 13 out of 150). Among 35 CTCs in
the treated mice, 8 cells could be detected on Day 62
following administration of cisplatin for 5 times, and
those cells were cisplatin-insensitive-CTCs, whereas other
27 detectable CTCs were eliminated by cisplatin prior
to Day 62, and they were defined as cisplatin-sensitiveCTCs in this study. Regarding 27 cisplatin-sensitive-CTCs
consisting of 7 CK18- and 20 CK18+ cells, 7 CK18- CTCs
were all diploid (100%, 7 out of 7), and remaining 20
CK18+ cells had 15 diploid (75%, 15 out of 20) as well
as 5 multiploid CTCs (25%, 5 out of 20). With respect to
the 8 cisplatin-insensitive-CTCs, all were CK18 positive,
including 37% (3 out of 8) diploid and 63% (5 out of 8)
multiploid cells.

Diverse subtypes of CTC possess different
sensitivities to cisplatin
Some CTCs were detected on Day 62 following
administration of cisplatin for 5 times or 5 weeks,
suggesting existence of cisplatin-insensitive CTCs in the
treated GA0087 mice. We took the advantage of in situ PK
CTC performed by CK-iFISH to identify and characterize
CTC subtypes for the purpose of pinpointing the specific
subtype insensitive to cisplatin. CTCs subtypes were
classified upon their CK18 expression and chromosome
8 ploidy in this study.
First of all the ratio of different CTC subtypes
among the total CTC population and those in vehicle or
cisplatin treated mice was analyzed. Demonstrated in
Figure 5A, among the total of 185 CTCs including 150
in vehicle and 35 in cisplatin treated mice, 84% (155 out
of 185) were CK18 positive, and the remaining 16% (30
out of 185) were CK18 negative; 88% of the total (162
out of 185) were diploid, and the rest 12% (23 out of 185)
were triploid or multiploid. Further analysis of 150 CTCs
in vehicle mice revealed that 85% (117 out of 150) were
CK18 positive, and the remaining 15% (23 out 150) were
CK18 negative. Ninety one percent (137 out of 150) of
those CTCs were diploid, and the remaining 9% (13 out of
150) were multiploid with the majority of trisomy. Of the
total of 35 CTCs detected in cisplatin treated mice, 80%
(28 out of 35) were CK18 positive, and the remaining 20%
(7 out of 35) were CK18 negative; 71% (25 out of 35) of
these CTCs were diploid, and 29% (10 out of 35) were

subtypes. Among total of 185 CTCs detected in both vehicle
and treated mice, 84% of CTCs are CK18+, and the rest of 16%
are CK18-; 88% are diploid, and remainng12% are multiploid,
respectively. Among 150 CTCs in the vehicle group, 85% are
CK18+, and the rest of 15% are CK18-; 91% of those CTCs
are diploid, and remaining 9% are multiploid. Regarding 35
CTCs identified in the cisplatin treated mice, 80% are CK18+,
and the other 20% are CK18-; 71% are diploid and rest 29%
are multiploid. (B) Characterization of CTC subtypes either
sensitive or insensitive to cisplatin in the treated group of mice.
Among 27 of chemosensitive CTCs detected only prior to
Day 62, there are both CK18- and CK18+ tumor cells. All of
CK18- CTCs are sensitive to cisplatin, and they are all diploid
(100%); for those CK18+ cisplatin-sensitive CTCs, 75% of
them are diploid, and remaining 25% are multiploid. Regarding
8 of cisplatin-insensitive CTCs detected on Day 62, none of
them (0%) are CK18- but all CK18+. Majority (63%) of those
chemoinsensitive CTCs are CK18+/multiploid, and the rest 37%
are CK18+/diploid.

Further analysis of those 35 CTCs in the treated
mice shown in Figure 5B revealed that all of the CK18
negative CTCs (100%) were diploid and chemosensitive.
However, CK18 positive CTCs were either sensitive or
insensitive to cisplatin depending on their chromosomal
ploidy. Taken together, the CK18+/diploid subtype
constituted the main population (75%) of chemosensitive
CTCs, whereas the CK18+/multiploid subtype constituted
the majority (63%) of cisplatin-insensitive CTCs.

passages, thus their resemblance to actual human tumor
specimens is usually significantly different. Pre-clinical
PDX models have been utilized for testing the efficacy of
experimental anti-cancer drugs [7], particularly because
they appear to maintain strong genetic resemblance to the
parental tumor [5-8, 28]. However, one limitation of PDX
models is the failure of these tumors to metastasize [6, 7].
Gene-expression profiling of the gastric neuroendocrine
carcinoma PDX model GA0087 established in this study
revealed particularly high gene expression of VEGF-A
and B, both of which have been recognized as having
a significant role in early tumor development [9] and
angiogenesis [10]. Moreover, VEGF-A has been reported
to correlate to distant hematogenous metastasis in gastric
cancer patients [11, 12]. The high gene expression of

cisplatin in gastric cancer patients [16], in situ PK CTC
performed by CK-i•FISH® in this study was able to
specifically pinpoint the distinct CTC subtypes either
chemosensitive or chemoinsensitive. In cisplatin treated
mice, all the CK18-/diploid and majority of CK18+/
diploid CTC subtypes were cisplatin-sensitive and
eliminated prior to Day 62. Among the 8 chemoinsensitive
CTCs detected on Day 62, higher percentage (63%) of
CK18+/multiploid cells were identified.. No recurrent
CTC was detected in GA0087 mice as long as they were
eliminated.
An interesting question arises from this study - how
does cisplatin impact on CTC numbers in GA0087 PDX
mice? Cisplatin, an alkylating-like chemotherapeutic
agent, cross-links DNA of cancer cells, followed by
triggering apoptosis and necrosis to those neoplastic
cells. The heterogeneous population of CTCs consists of
epithelial cells, EMT transition cells, hybrid epithelial/
EMT tumor cells, irreversible EMT cells and circulating
tumor stem cell (CTSC) [32]. In cancer patients,
“mesenchymal CTCs” (epithelial marker CK/E-cadherin
negative, mesenchymal marker vimentin/N-cadherin
positive) are chemoresistant [20, 33, 34], which keeps in
agreement with our previous report indicating the majority
of gastric cancer CTCs were CK18- and chemoresistant
[16]. In contrast to negative CK18 expression in majority
of patients’ CTCs, in situ PK CTCs performed by CKi•FISH® showed that most of the CTCs in various PDX
models (Figure 6B) including GA0087 were CK18+,
and many of them were eliminated following cisplatin
treatment, suggesting that most of the CTCs in GA0087
PDX mice might be chemosensitive “Epithelial CTCs”.
Several intriguing questions remain to be further
investigated with respect to exploring how cisplatin
impacts on decreasing CTC numbers in PDX mice, such as
whether PDX CTCs are mesenchymal cells similar to that
in patients; whether the EMT mechanism in PDX mice
is similar to that of human; whether there is a correlation
of CTC’s ploidy and vimentin/CK18 expression with
chemoresistance in PDX mice; and whether cisplatin
targets only on PDX CTCs in blood, or exclusively on
the cancer cells in primary solid tumor (Figure 3A),
subsequently resulting in hematogenous dissemination of
much fewer cancer cells, etc. Answering to those questions
will help us understand more about the mechanisms of
CTC’s chemoresistance or sensitivity in both cancer
patients as well as PDX tumor models.
In conclusion, obtained results in this study indicated
that CTC can serve as an effective indicator for pre-clinical
evaluation of anti-cancer agents efficacy in the metastatic
PDX (mPDX) model. In addition to conventional
enumerating metastatic nodules in post-mortem mice at the
completion of the experiment, the more significant cellular
and molecular strategy of dynamic monitoring CTC
subtypes is able to constantly quantitate and characterize
various hematogenous disseminated cancer cells following

VEGF-A in GA0087 PDX mice is consistent with our
current observations showing that GA0087 PDX model
has high metastasizing potential to lung.
Although metastases were not found in the donor
GC patient (TNM Staging II, T3N1M0) by the time
when surgical resection was performed, the tumor did
metastasize in the PDX model GA0087, suggesting
that additional host factors prior to tumor resection in
patients, including CTC subtype status and/or VEGF-A
expression, etc. could be the more significant “predictor”
with respect to establishing a metastatic PDX (mPDX)
model. Moreover, the PDX mouse model may recapitulate
events that will occur in the future in the patient. Given
the reality that CTC numbers do not always correlate with
the conventional TNM staging [17, 29], correlation of
CTC subtype status in donor patients with metastasizing
potential of PDX mice is currently under our investigation
in large cohorts of cancer patients at different TNM stages.
Application of CTC to evaluate therapeutic drug
efficacy in a mPDX model has been rarely reported. The
conventional CTC detection technology is restricted to
enumeration of only both EpCAM and cytokeratin (CK)
positive CTCs [19]. However, down-regulation or loss of
both EpCAM and CK were reported in EMT CTC [20],
such inherited property of tumor cell may result in failure
to detect significant amount of CTCs by the conventional
strategy [30, 31]. In this study, we took advantage of
SE-i•FISH® [16] to enrich, detect and characterize
different subtypes of CTC for the purpose of evaluating
chemotherapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in mPDX mice.
Both CTM and individual CTCs with different sizes
varying from that as small as WBCs to larger cells in
GA0087 mice could be efficiently detected.
High metastasizing potential in terms of the
percentage of CTC and/or metastatic lesion positivity in
GA0087 mice was demonstrated in Figure 6A, showing
that 7 out of 8 treated or vehicle mice (7 out of 8 or 14 out
of total 16, 88%) were found metastatic lesion positive
in lung, and 12 of those total 16 mice showed detectable
CTC (12/16, 75%). Among those 14 lesion positive mice,
CTCs were found in 12 mice including all the 7 treated
and 5 of untreated vehicle mice, the positive rate was 86%
(12 out of 14). In the current study, tumor heterogeneity
of variable metastasizing potential was observed in the
control group. Two vehicle mice with positive metastatic
lesion were not found to have detectable CTC, likelihood
due to very few number or short-life time of CTCs existing
either prior to initial CTC detection on Day 14, or beyond
the scheduled time intervals for CTC detection, suggesting
that the initial CTC detection could be started less than
2 weeks since the date of Sub-Q implantation, and more
frequent periodical CTC detection should be performed
during the entire study.
In accordance with our previous observation

administration of therapeutic agents in pre-mortem mice
in real time. Moreover, therapeutic agent sensitive- or
resistant-tumorigenic polyclonal CTCs [28] or the feasible
subcloned monoclonal CTC subtype derived xenograft
mouse models (CDXs) could be a valuable alternative in
addition to the conventional PDX model. in situ PK CTC
by i•FISH® is able to efficiently identify CTC subtypes
possessing diverse chemosensitivities in both cancer
patients and tumor animal models for further genetic
and functional analyses performed on either pooled or
single CTC [27, 35], and such unique advantage will help
promote developing new anti-cancer drugs as well as
cancer research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Anti-tumor activity study

Establishment and genetic characterization of the
metastatic HuPrime® PDX model GA0087

GA0087 PDX mice (P8) with tumor mass of
approximate 150 mm3 were randomly divided into 2
groups (8 mice per group), followed by intravenously
(IV) injecting with either 0.9% NaCl (vehicle) or cisplatin
(4 mg/kg, Jiutai Pharmaceutical, Jinan, China) on Day 27
post Sub-Q on Day 1. Cisplatin was prepared at 0.4 mg/
mL in 0.9% NaCl for injection. Administration of cisplatin
or 0.9% NaCl was performed for total of 5 times at the
indicated time intervals. Tumor volume (1/2×L×W2) of
each mouse was measured twice weekly using a caliber.
T/C value (percent of ∆T/∆C), the read out of tumor
response to the treatment, was calculated as tumor volume
change between the final and initial measurement date in
cisplatin group/tumor volume change in vehicle group. All
the animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment
on Day 76. Both vehicle and cisplatin treated group
respectively had 2 tumor free mice as negative control.

Protocol of establishment of PDX model GA0087
was essentially similar to that previously published
by us [36, 37]. Briefly, tumor tissue was surgically
removed from a treatment-naive 74 years old female
Asian patient diagnosed with gastric neuroendocrine
tumor (ulcerative type, T3N1M0, TNM Stage II). Freshly
dissected tumor tissue (3×3×3 mm3) was subcutaneously
(Sub-Q) engrafted on the flank of 3-5 weeks old female
immunocompromised Balb/c nude mice. When the size
of tumor in the established primary tumor models (P0)
reached 500-700 mm3 (1/2×L×W2), primary tumors were
harvested and equally cut to the small fragments of 3×3×3
mm3, and subcutaneously re-engrafted on the flank of
3-5 weeks old female immunocompromised Balb/c nude
mice for expansion (P1). After 3 consecutive passages,
the xenograft was stabilized and subsequently subjected
to model characterization, including histopathological
analysis and gene expression microarray assay. Fresh
tumor fragments at passage P3-P5 were frozen with 20%
FCS in liquid nitrogen for further model recovery. Serial
re-engrafting was repeated for no more than 10 times
(P10). All procedures were sterilely performed at the SPF
facility (Crown Bioscience, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
For profiling of gene expression in GA0087 model,
fresh tumor tissues were dissected from GA0087 tumorbearing mice, and subsequently snap-frozen at −80°C.
Total RNA was isolated from the frozen tissues using
Trizol according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and purified by means
of a RNeasy mini column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
Obtained RNA was subjected to a Bioanalyzer (Model
2100, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for
assessment of RNA quality. Only the high quality of RNA
samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 8 were
applied for expression profiling assays on HG-U219 array

Histopathological examination of the tumor
metastatic lesion in lung
Lung tissues from all of the sacrificed GA0087 PDX
mice were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin at 4°C for 24 hours, followed by tissue processing
overnight. Processed tissues were subsequently embedded
in paraffin. After deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue
sections (16 µm in thickness) were treated with 0.01 M
sodium citrate (pH 6.0) at 95ºC for 30 min, followed by
staining with hematoxilyn and eosin (H&E). Number
of tumor metastatic nodules in lung was enumerated by
means of a bright-field microscope.

were performed according to the product manufacture’s
instruction (Cytelligen, San Diego, CA, USA). Decoding,
analysis and evaluation of CTC subtypes correlating to the
animal tumor status were co-performed by cross blinded
research scientists.
Retro-orbital bleeding (200 μl/mouse) was
performed from Day 14 post-Sub-Q and periodically
repeated at the indicated time intervals. For each bleeding,
200 μl of the collected mouse blood were immediately
and thoroughly mixed with anti-mouse blood coagulant
(Cytelligen) by gentle shaking. Samples were kept at 4ºC
for up to 24 hours, followed by subtraction enrichment
(SE) and CK-iFISH. Briefly, mouse blood samples
containing anti-coagulant were incubated with anti-mouse
leukocyte monoclonal antibodies conjugated to magnetic
beads for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation.
The mixed solution was loaded on the non-hematopoietic
cell separation matrix and centrifuged at 400 x g for 5
minutes. Magnetic beads in collected supernatants were
removed using a magnetic stand (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin, USA). CTCs in the solution were spun down
at 1050 × g for 5 min in a micro-centrifuge tube. Cell
pellet was applied on the coated CTC slide (Cytelligen)
and air dried. For subsequent CK-iFISH, dried sample
on the slide was incubated with Vysis Centromere Probe
(CEP) 8 SpectrumRed (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott
Park, IL, USA) using a S500 StatSpin ThermoBrite Slide
Hybridization/Denaturation System (Abbott Molecular,
Des Plaines, IL, USA) for 2 hrs, followed by incubation
with monoclonal anti-human CK18 conjugated to Alexa
Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) at room temperature for
1 hr [38, 39]. The sample was subsequently subjected to
collection and analysis of CTC images acquired using a
fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Model Ni-U) equipped
with an appropriate filter set. Identified CTC was defined
as DAPI+, CEP8+, CK18+/or -.
