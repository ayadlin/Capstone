Abstract

Author Manuscript

Aberrant Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is one of the most prevalent oncogenic alterations and
confers survival advantage to tumor cells. Inhibition of this pathway can effectively suppress
tumor cell growth. For example, sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting c-Raf and other
oncogenic kinases, has been used clinically for treating advanced liver and kidney tumors, and
also has shown efficacy against other malignancies. However, how inhibition of oncogenic
signaling by sorafenib and other drugs suppresses tumor cell growth remains unclear. In this
study, we found that sorafenib kills cancer cells by activating PUMA, a p53 target and a BH3-only
Bcl-2 family protein. Sorafenib treatment induces PUMA in a variety of cancer cells irrespective
of their p53 status. Surprisingly, the induction of PUMA by sorafenib is mediated by IκBindependent activation of NF-κB, which directly binds to the PUMA promoter to activate its
transcription. NF-κB activation by sorafenib requires GSK3β activation, subsequent to ERK
inhibition. Deficiency in PUMA abrogates sorafenib-induced apoptosis and caspase activation,
and renders sorafenib resistance in colony formation and xenograft tumor assays. Furthermore, the
chemosensitization effect of sorafenib is dependent on PUMA, and involves concurrent PUMA
induction through different pathways. BH3 mimetics potentiate the anticancer effects of sorafenib,
and restore sorafenib sensitivity in resistant cells. Together, these results demonstrate a key role of
PUMA-dependent apoptosis in therapeutic inhibition of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. They
provide a rationale for manipulating the apoptotic machinery to improve sensitivity and overcome
resistance to the therapies that target oncogenic kinase signaling.

Introduction
Addictive oncogenic kinase signaling perpetuates tumor phenotypes, including sustained
cell proliferation, insensitivity to apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis. The
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is aberrantly activated in most tumor cells due to Ras or Raf
mutations (1). Sorafenib (Nexavar), an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits several
aberrantly activated kinases in tumor cells, including c-Raf, B-Raf, PDGFR (platelet-derived
growth factor receptor), and VEGFRs (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors) 1–3,
has been used for the treatment of advanced kidney and liver tumors (2, 3). It has also been
tested in hundreds of clinical trials against a variety of malignancies, including those of
colon, lung, and breast. Unfortunately, the anticancer mechanisms of sorafenib and most
targeted anticancer drugs remain poorly understood. Inevitable tumor recurrence due to
acquired drug resistance has significantly limited clinical applications of targeted therapies.

Induction of apoptosis in cancer cells has emerged as a key effect of targeted therapies (4).
For example, clinical response to EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) targeted therapy
is correlated with induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, and defective apoptosis regulation
contributes to resistance of EGFR targeted therapy (5). The anticancer effects of sorafenib
are also thought to be mediated by apoptosis induction in cancer cells, in addition to its antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic effects (6). Sorafenib kills a variety of tumor cells in vitro
and in vivo, and its proapoptotic activity is significantly enhanced when combined with
genotoxic drugs (7). Recent studies suggest that sorafenib-induced apoptosis is associated
with downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and inhibition of eIF4E (eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E) phosphorylation (8–10). However, Mcl-1 depletion alone is
often insufficient to trigger apoptosis in solid tumor cells, and the timing of these changes
does not correlate with that of apoptosis induction in sorafenib-treated cells (7). Therefore,
how sorafenib triggers apoptosis in cancer cells remains unresolved.

Author Manuscript

PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member,
functions as a critical initiator of apoptosis in cancer cells (11). Its transcription is directly
activated by p53 in response to DNA damage. Lack of PUMA induction renders p53deficient cancer cells refractory to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs (12).
PUMA can also be induced in a p53-independent manner by a variety of non-genotoxic
stimuli, such as the pan-kinase inhibitor UCN-01(13), the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and
erlotinib (14), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (15). p53-independent PUMA induction
can be mediated by the transcription factors p73, FoxO3a (Forkhead Box O3a), and NF-κB
(nuclear factor κB) (13–16). Upon its induction, PUMA potently induces apoptosis in cancer
cells by antagonizing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and
activating the proapoptotic members Bax and Bak, which results in mitochondrial
dysfunction and caspase activation cascade (17–19).
In this study, we found that sorafenib kills colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by
activating PUMA through NF-κB. Our results shed light on the anticancer mechanism of
sorafenib, and provide a rationale for manipulating PUMA and other apoptosis regulators to
improve the efficacy of targeted therapies.

Results
Sorafenib selectively induces PUMA in cells expressing wildtype or mutant p53

Author Manuscript

We analyzed the effects of sorafenib in colorectal cancer cells because these cells were
initially used for characterizing the anticancer activities of sorafenib (20, 21). Treating p53wildtype (WT) HCT116 colon cancer cells with 5 to 20 μmol/L sorafenib strongly induced
PUMA protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figures 1a and b). PUMA
mRNA was also induced by sorafenib (Figure 1c). The peak levels of PUMA mRNA and
protein were detected at 16–24 hours following sorafenib treatment (Figures 1b and c). The
induction of PUMA by sorafenib was found to be intact in p53-KO HCT116 cells (Figures
1a and c), and occurred in all of the colon cancer cells analyzed, including p53-WT
Lim1405, Lovo, and RKO colon cancer cells, and p53-mutant DLD1 and HT29 colon
cancer cells, as well as in HepG2 and Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Figure 1d).
Furthermore, analysis of other Bcl-2 family members showed that sorafenib treatment did
not induce the BH3-only proteins Bad, Bid, Bim, and Noxa, but led to degradation of Mcl-1
as previously reported (8), and a slight induction of Bcl-2 (Figure 1e). These results indicate
that PUMA is selectively induced by sorafenib and may mediate its anticancer effects.
PUMA activation by sorafenib is mediated by NF-κB

Author Manuscript

We then investigated the mechanism by which sorafenib induces PUMA in the absence of
p53. Knockdown of c-Raf by siRNA induced PUMA expression (Figures 2a and b), while
depletion of other sorafenib targets, including B-Raf, VEGFR2, PDGFR-β, and c-Kit, did not
increase PUMA expression (Supplementary Figure S1a and b), suggesting that PUMA
induction by sorafenib results from c-Raf inhibition. FoxO3a, a transcription factor that can
induce PUMA following its de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (22), remained
phosphorylated in sorafenib-treated cells (Supplementary Figure S1c). Knockdown of
FoxO3a by siRNA did not affect PUMA induction by sorafenib (Supplementary Figure
S1d), indicating that FoxO3a is not involved in PUMA induction by sorafenib. The
expression of p73, another transcription factor that can induce PUMA in p53-deficient cells
(16), was unchanged after sorafenib treatment (data not shown). Sorafenib treatment also did
not affect the expression and phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 and
STAT3 (Supplementary Figure S1e), which have been implicated in the effects of sorafenib
(23).

The p65 subunit of NF-κB was recently identified as a transcriptional activator of PUMA in
response to TNF-α treatment (15). Suppression of p65 expression by siRNA reduced PUMA
levels following sorafenib treatment in both HCT116 and DLD1 cells (Figures 2c and d). In
support of the requirement for p65, the induction of PUMA by sorafenib was also
suppressed in p65-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 2d). Activation of NFκB signaling is characterized by p65 phosphorylation on several residues and its subsequent
translocation to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of target genes (24). We found
that sorafenib treatment for 4–16 hours enhanced phosphorylation of S536, the major
regulatory site of p65 (24), in both WT and p53-KO HCT116 cells (Figure 2e).
Phosphorylation of S276, another site associated with p65 activation (24), was also
increased after sorafenib treatment, while that of the controversial S468 site was unchanged

(Supplementary Figure S2a). Translocation of p65 to the nucleus was detected in cells
treated with sorafenib or the control TNF-α by p65 immunofluorescence (Figure 2f), and by
nuclear fractionation (Figure 3a). Consistent with NF-κB activation, transcription of TNF-α,
a target of p65, was increased in response to sorafenib treatment (Figure 2g). But TNF-α
secretion was not detected in sorafenib-treated cells (data not shown).
NF-κB binds to novel κB sites to directly activate PUMA transcription after sorafenib
treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine how NF-κB activates PUMA transcription in response to sorafenib treatment,
cells were pre-treated with BAY 11-7082, an NF-κB inhibitor suppressing p65 nuclear
translocation (Figure 3a, left). NF-κB inhibition by BAY 11-7082 impeded PUMA induction
by sorafenib or TNF-α (Figure 3a, right), suggesting that PUMA induction by sorafenib is
mediated by p65 nuclear translocation. However, the change in p65 nuclear translocation
detected by fractionation, which might be incomplete, seems to be less than that of PUMA
induction. To determine whether NF-κB can directly activate PUMA transcription, p53-KO
HCT116 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing different
regions of the PUMA promoter (Frags A-D; Figure 3b, left) (16). The previously identified
NF-κB responsive element distal to Fragment D that is required for PUMA induction by
TNF-α (15), was not activated in sorafenib-treated cells (data not shown). In contrast, the
proximal 495-bp region of the PUMA promoter (Frags A and E) could be strongly activated
upon sorafenib treatment (Figure 3b, right). Analysis of the DNA sequence in this region
identified at least 5 previously unrecognized putative κB sites (Figure 3c). Mutations of all 5
κB sites completely blocked PUMA promoter activation by sorafenib treatment (Figure 3d),
suggesting that multiple κB sites contribute to the activation of the PUMA promoter. Among
the 5 sites analyzed, the third κB site (κB 3) seems to suppress the activity of PUMA
promoter (Figure 3d). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that p65 was
recruited to the region containing the κB sites following sorafenib treatment (Figure 3e).
Together, these results indicate that p65 directly binds to multiple κB sites in the proximal
PUMA promoter region to drive its transcriptional activation in response to sorafenib
treatment.
GSK3β-dependent, but IκB-independent p65 activation mediates PUMA induction by
sorafenib

Author Manuscript

The canonical pathway of p65 activation is mediated by IκB phosphorylation and
degradation, for example, in response to TNF-α treatment. Surprisingly, sorafenib treatment
did not lead to IκB phosphorylation or degradation (Supplementary Figure S2b).
Transfecting cells with IκBαM, a non-degradable mutant of IκB (15), did not affect
sorafenib-induced PUMA expression (Figure 4a), suggesting that p65 activation and PUMA
induction by sorafenib are not mediated by the canonical NF-κB pathway. Further analysis
of other kinases known to activate NF-κB revealed that glycogen synthase kinase 3β
(GSK3β) is involved in activating p65 following sorafenib treatment. Knockdown of GSK3β
by siRNA suppressed sorafenib-induced p65 nuclear translocation determined by nuclear
fractionation (Figure 4b), and by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure S3). GSK3β
depletion also significantly reduced the levels of PUMA following sorafenib treatment in
both HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cells (Figure 4c). Furthermore, sorafenib treatment

suppressed Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β, which inhibits its kinase activity (25), in both
WT and p53-KO HCT116 cells (Figure 4d). It has been shown that the ERK kinase can
prime GSK3β Ser9 phosphorylation to inhibit its activity (26). We found that sorafenib
exposure strongly impaired phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) throughout the course
of treatment (Figure 4e). To determine whether ERK inhibition contributes to the activation
of GSK3β, p65 and PUMA, we treated cells with the ERK inhibitor PD98059. ERK
inhibition by PD98059 phenocopies sorafenib treatment in blocking GSK3β Ser9
phosphorylation, and promoting p65 phosphorylation and PUMA expression (Figure 4f).
Together, these results demonstrate that PUMA induction by sorafenib is mediated by ERK
inhibition, relief of GSK3β inhibition, and subsequent p65 activation.
PUMA is required for sorafenib-induced apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We then determined the role of PUMA induction in sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis
induced by 5–20 μmol/L sorafenib was markedly reduced in PUMA-KO cells but remained
intact in p53-KO cells, in comparison with the parental HCT116 cells (Figure 5a and
Supplementary Figure S4a). Annexin V/PI staining confirmed the suppression of sorafenibinduced apoptosis by the absence of PUMA (Figure 5b). Sorafenib-induced and PUMAdependent apoptosis is not cell line-specific, and was also observed in DLD1 colon cancer
cells (Figure 5c). In addition, sorafenib-induced apoptosis was found to be significantly
reduced in p65-KO and PUMA-KO MEFs compared to WT MEFs (Figure 5c). PUMA
deficiency inhibited sorafenib-induced mitochondrial events, including activation of
caspases 3, 8, and 9 (Figure 5d), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (Figure 5e), and
cytochrome c release (Figure 5f). Reduced apoptosis in PUMA-KO cells does not seem to
result from altered expression of other Bcl-2 family members or eIF4E (Supplementary
Figure S4b). Furthermore, analysis of long-term cell survival by colony formation assay
showed that PUMA-KO cells were less sensitive to sorafenib than WT cells (Figure 5g).
Therefore, the killing effect of sorafenib on cancer cells is mediated by PUMA through the
mitochondrial pathway.
PUMA mediates the chemosensitization effects of sorafenib

Author Manuscript

Sorafenib has mostly been used in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapies for
cancer treatment. We reasoned that the chemosensitization effects of sorafenib are mediated
by PUMA induction, because of the distinct mechanisms of PUMA activation by sorafenib
and other drugs. Indeed, we found that sorafenib combined with cisplatin, which can
enhance killing of various tumor cells (7), induced PUMA at a much higher level than
sorafenib or cisplatin alone (Figure 6a). This is consistent with concurrent PUMA induction
through both p53-dependent and -independent pathways by cisplatin and sorafenib,
respectively. Accordingly, the level of apoptosis was also significantly higher in WT
HCT116 cells, but not in PUMA-KO cells following the combination treatment (Figure 6b).
A combination of sorafenib with UCN-01, a kinase inhibitor that induces PUMA through a
pathway mediated by FoxO3a (13), also showed PUMA-dependent enhancement in
apoptosis induction (Figure 6c). These results prompted us to test whether manipulating
apoptosis by BH3 mimetics can sensitize cells to sorafenib. GX15-070, a BH3 mimetic
compound analogous to PUMA in inhibiting all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (27),
markedly enhanced sorafenib-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells (Figure 6d). GX15-070

also partially restored sorafenib sensitivity in PUMA-KO cells (Figure 6e). These data
suggest that PUMA mediates the chemosensitization effects of sorafenib, and manipulating
apoptosis can improve the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib.
The in vivo therapeutic activity of sorafenib is PUMA-dependent

Author Manuscript

Sorafenib can effectively suppress the growth of colon cancer xenograft tumors (28). To
determine if PUMA mediates the antitumor effects of sorafenib, WT and PUMA-KO
HCT116 cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice to establish xenograft tumors.
Mice were then treated with 25 mg/kg sorafenib or the control vehicle by oral gavage for 7
consecutive days, as previously described (28). WT and PUMA-KO tumors were not
different in growth after the control treatment (Figures 7a and b). Sorafenib treatment
suppressed the growth of WT tumors by 60–80%, consistent with the previous report (28).
In contrast, PUMA-KO tumors were significantly less sensitive to sorafenib treatment
compared to WT tumors (Figures 7a, b, and Table S1), indicating that loss of PUMA
suppressed the antitumor activity of sorafenib. Following sorafenib treatment, p65
phosphorylation and PUMA expression were found to be increased in xenograft tumors
(Figure 7c). TUNEL staining revealed significant apoptosis induction in tumor tissues from
the sorafenib-treated mice, but not the control mice. In contrast, apoptosis was barely
detectable in the PUMA-KO tumors (Figure 7d). Analysis of apoptosis by active caspase 3
staining confirmed PUMA-dependent apoptosis in sorafenib-treated tumors (Figure 7e).
Therefore, the in vivo antitumor activity of sorafenib is largely dependent on PUMA and
involves NF-κB activation.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Sorafenib is the first FDA-approved multi-kinase inhibitor drug that targets the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which is aberrantly activated in a majority of cancers due to
Ras or Raf mutations (1). Sorafenib and other multi-kinase inhibitor drugs, such as sunitinib,
can inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and suppress tumor angiogenesis. While
growth inhibition by sorafenib has been extensively characterized, the exact mechanism of
sorafenib-induced apoptosis has not been clearly identified. Our results demonstrate that
PUMA is activated following sorafenib exposure, and is necessary for sorafenib-induced
apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that sorafenib plasma
concentrations could be as high as 10–20 μM (29). However, sorafenib is known to be
bound to plasma proteins (7), and the biological active concentration of sorafenib in cultured
cells may be higher than that in plasma of patients. backbone

Author Manuscript

Sorafenib-induced apoptosis was previously associated with degradation of Mcl-1 and
inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation (8–10). Mcl-1 depletion alone can induce apoptosis in
hematopoietic cells (30), but is insufficient to induce apoptosis in the colon cancer cells we
have studied, likely due to high levels of other antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-XL.
Induction of PUMA, on the other hand, can inhibit all antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members,
and activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (11). The increasing PUMA expression between
8–24 hours following sorafenib treatment also reconciles the previously noted “temporal
disconnect” phenomenon (7), in which loss of eIF4E phosphorylation and Mcl-1 expression

occurs within the first 4 hours (10), much earlier than apoptotic events detected at 24 hours
after sorafenib treatment. In addition to PUMA, other BH3-only proteins can also contribute
to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. For example, sorafenib was shown to activate Bim to induce
apoptosis in leukemia cells (31). The relative contributions of different BH3-only proteins
are likely to be cell type-dependent.

Author Manuscript

PUMA-dependent apoptosis can be triggered by oncogene activation and functions as a
safe-guide mechanism against oncogenic signaling (11). Induction of PUMA seems to be
attributable to c-Raf inhibition by sorafenib. It is unexpected that the induction of PUMA
relies on NF-κB, which is better known for its pro-survival activity. But NF-κB can clearly
promote apoptosis under certain conditions (32). Recent studies have shown that the NF-κB
signaling cascade can stimulate TNF-α secretion, which sets up a feedforward loop to
promote apoptosis in response to extensive DNA damage (33). NF-κB activation by
sorafenib does not involve IκB degradation, but is regulated by GSK3β through ERK
inhibition. These results reinforce the multi-facet nature of NF-κB signaling, and suggest a
potential role of NF-κB signaling in mediating responses to targeted therapies, which has
not been appreciated.

Sorafenib is effective against a variety of malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and
melanoma (7). Currently, there are over 400 clinical trials involving sorafenib (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov). Our data demonstrate that PUMA-mediated apoptosis is critical for
the anticancer activities of sorafenib in colon cancer cells, implying that PUMA induction
can be used as a marker for therapeutic response to sorafenib, and possibly for other targeted
drugs as well. Sorafenib has been most promising when used in combination with other
chemotherapeutic agents. Depending on dosage and cell type, sorafenib combined with other
drugs has additive and sometimes synergistic anticancer effects. In vitro and in vivo studies
showed that sorafenib potentiates the effects of genotoxic agents, such as temozolomide,
radiation, and melphalan (21, 34). Encouraging results have been obtained from clinical
trials for combining sorafenib with genotoxic adjuvant treatments that involve cisplatin (35,
36). Our data suggest that the sensitization effect of sorafenib on cisplatin can be mediated
by concurrent PUMA induction via both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
Sorafenib can also enhance tumor cell apoptosis in conjunction with non-genotoxic drugs,
such as mTOR inhibitors (37), histone deacetylase inhibitors, and EGFR inhibitors (38).
Ongoing clinical trials are testing combinations of sorafenib with erlotinib (39), and the
farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (40). It is perhaps understandable that these drugs
work better in combination, because they likely induce PUMA through different pathways
(14, 41, 42). Identifying effective drug combinations will be the key for clinical applications
of sorafenib and other targeted drugs. PUMA induction may serve as a useful indicator for
identifying such combination regimens.
Acquired drug resistance represents a major limitation of chemotherapy, and more so for
targeted therapy. The pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor GX15-070 restored apoptosis in sorafenib-resistant
PUMA-KO cells, suggesting that manipulating apoptotic pathways can help overcome
sorafenib resistance. GX15-070 was also found to potentate the effect of sorafenib in
chemo-resistant cancer cells lacking CD95 expression, or with overexpression of

antiapoptotic c-FLIP (43). The BH3 mimetic compound ABT-737 is effective in inducing
apoptosis in HCC that would normally be cytostatic to sorafenib treatment (44). Another
case of sorafenib resistance in HCC is shown to be caused by activation of PI3K/Akt
signaling (45), and can be overcome by PI3K/Akt inhibition (46). We found that UCN-01,
also a PI3K/Akt inhibitor, enhanced the killing effect of sorafenib in a PUMA-dependent
manner, likely through FoxO3a-mediated PUMA induction (13). Together, these
observations suggest that the PUMA-mediated apoptotic pathway might be explored to
overcome resistance to targeted therapies. However, the clinical relevance of our findings
remains to be established using more relevant cell models and human patient specimens.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we demonstrate that activation of PUMA by NF-κB mediates the apoptotic
and anticancer effects of sorafenib in colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. PUMA
induction may be a useful indicator for therapeutic response to sorafenib, and possibly other
targeted drugs.

Cell culture and drug treatment

Author Manuscript

The human cancer cell lines, including HCT116, RKO, Lim2405, LOVO, HT29 and DLD1
colorectal cancer cells, and HepG2 and Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Isogenic p53-knockout (KO) and

Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated from sorafenib-treated cells using the Mini RNA Isolation II Kit
(Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One μg of total RNA was used
to generate cDNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
was carried out as before for PUMA and GAPDH (13).
Transfection and siRNA knockdown

Author Manuscript

Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Knockdown experiments were performed 24 hours before
sorafenib treatment using 400 pmoles of siRNA. GSK3β (sc-35527) and VEGFR2 siRNA
(sc-29318) were from Santa Cruz. All other siRNA, including those against human p65 (15),
c-Raf (AAGCACGCTTAGATTGGAATA-dTdT), PDGFRβ
(GCAUCUUCAACAGCCUCUA-dTdT), B-Raf (ACAGAGACCUCAAGAGUAA-UU), cKit (GGCCGACAAAAGGAGAUCU-dTdT), and the control scrambled siRNA, were from
Dharmacon. A non-degradable IκBα super repressor mutant (S32/36A; IκBαM) was
previously described (15).
Luciferase assays

Author Manuscript

PUMA luciferase reporter constructs were generated by cloning genomic fragments
(Fragments A-E) into the pBV-Luc plasmid as previously described (16). Mutations were
introduced into the p65 binding sites of Fragment A using QuickChange XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). For reporter assays, cells were transfected with the
WT or mutant PUMA reporter along with the transfection control β-galactosidase reporter
pCMVβ (Promega). Cell lysates were collected and luciferase activities were measured and
normalized to those of pCMVβ as previously described (48). All reporter experiments were
performed in triplicate and repeated thrice.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP was performed using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (Upstate
Biotechnology) as previously described (47), with p65 antibody (Santa Cruz) for chromatin
precipitation. The precipitates were analyzed by PCR using primers 5′GTCGGTCTGTGTACGCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCGTGACGCTACGGCCC-3′.
Analysis of NF-κB nuclear translocation

Author Manuscript

HCT116 cells pre-treated with BAY11-7082 or transfected with GSK3β siRNA were
subjected to sorafenib or TNF-α treatment for 3 hours. NF-κB nuclear translocation was
analyzed by nuclear fractionation and immunofluorescence. For nuclear fractionation,
nuclear extracts were isolated from cells plated and treated in 75-cm2 flasks using the NEPER nuclear/cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and probed by Western blotting for p65. For immunofluoscence, cells plated
and treated in chamber slides were subject to primary staining with anti-p65 (Cell Signaling)
overnight at 4°C, and secondary staining with the anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488-conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT, as previously described (48). Images were
acquired with an Olympus IX71 microscope.

Analysis of apoptosis

Author Manuscript

Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) was performed as previously described
(49). Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed using annexin-Alexa 488
(Invitrogen) and PI as described (50). For analysis of cytochrome c release, mitochondrial
and cytosolic fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation (18), followed by
Western blotting for cytochrome c. For colony formation assays, the treated cells were
plated in 12-well plates at appropriate dilutions, and allowed to grow for 10–14 days before
staining with crystal violet (Sigma). For detection of mitochondrial membrane potential
change, the treated cells were stained by MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 15
minutes at room temperature (RT), and then analyzed by flow cytometry.
Xenograft tumor experiments

Author Manuscript

All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Female 5–6 week-old Nu/Nu mice (Charles River) were housed in
a sterile environment with micro isolator cages and allowed access to water and chow ad
libitum. Mice were injected subcutaneously in both flanks with 4×106 WT or PUMA-KO
HCT116 cells. Following tumor growth for 7 days, mice were treated daily with sorafenib at
25 mg/kg by oral gavage for 7 consecutive days. Sorafenib was dissolved in Cremephor
EL/95% ethanol (50:50) as a 4× stock solution (20), and diluted to the final concentration
with sterile water before use. Tumor growth was monitored by calipers, and tumor volumes
were calculated according to the formula ½ × length × width2. Mice were euthanized when
tumors reached ~1.0 cm3 in size. Tumors were dissected and fixed in 10% formalin and
embedded in paraffin. TUNEL and active caspase 3 immunostaining was performed on 5
μM paraffin-embedded tumor sections as previously described (51), with an AlexaFluor
594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for signal detection.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism IV software. P values were
calculated by the student’s t-test and were considered significant if P <0.05. The means ±
one standard deviation (s.d.) were displayed in the figures.

sorafenib for 36 hours were probed for cytochrome c by Western blotting. α-Tubulin and
cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (Cox IV), which are expressed in cytoplasm and
mitochondria, respectively, were analyzed as the control for loading fractionation. g. Colony
formation assay was done by seeding an equal number of WT and PUMA-KO HCT116 cells
treated with 10 or 20 μmol/L sorafenib for 48 hours in 12-well plates, and then staining
attached cells with crystal violet 14 days later. Left, representative pictures of colonies;
Right, quantification of colony numbers. Results in a, c and g were expressed as means ± SD
of 3 independent experiments. ***, P <0.001; **, P <0.01; *, P <0.05; NS, not significant.

a. HCT116 cells were treated with 20 μmol/L sorafenib, 20 μmol/L cisplatin, or their
combination for 24 hours. PUMA expression was analyzed by Western blotting. b. WT and
PUMA-KO HCT116 cells were treated with 20 μmol/L sorafenib, 50 μmol/L cisplatin, or
their combination for 48 hours. Apoptosis was determined by nuclear staining with Hoechst
33258. c. WT and PUMA-KO HCT116 cells were treated for 48 hours with 1 μmol/L
UCN-01 with or without a combination with 10 or 20 μmol/L sorafenib. Apoptosis was
analyzed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. d. WT HCT116 cells were treated with 20
μmol/L sorafenib, alone or in combination with 5 μmol/L of the BH3 mimetic GX15-070.
Apoptosis was determined by nuclear staining 48 hours after treatment. e. Apoptosis in
PUMA-KO HCT116 cells treated with sorafenib alone or in combination with GX15-070
analyzed as in d. Results of nuclear staining in b-e were expressed as means ± SD of 3
independent experiments. ***, P <0.001; **, P <0.01; *, P <0.05.

a. Nude mice were injected s.c. with 4 × 106 WT or PUMA-KO HCT116 cells. After 1
week, mice were oral gavaged with 25 mg/kg sorafenib or the control cremephor EL/ethanol
buffer for 7 consecutive days. Tumor volume at indicated time points after treatment was
calculated and plotted (n=5 in each group). Arrows indicate sorafenib injection. Statistical
significance is indicated for comparison of sorafenib-treated WT and PUMA-KO tumors.
***, P <0.001; **, P <0.01; *, P <0.05. b. Representative tumors at the end of the
experiment in a. c. WT and PUMA-KO HCT116 xenograft tumors were treated with 25
mg/kg sorafenib or the control buffer as in a for 4 consecutive days. p-p65 (S536) and
PUMA expression in representative tumors was analyzed by Western blotting. d. WT or
PUMA-KO HCT116 cells were treated with 25 mg/kg sorafenib or control buffer by oral
gavage for 7 consecutive days as described in a. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were
analyzed by TUNEL staining. Left, representative TUNEL staining pictures (400×); Right,
TUNEL-positive cells were counted and plotted. e. WT or PUMA-KO tumor tissues from
mice treated as in a were analyzed by active caspase 3 staining. Left, representative staining
pictures (400×); Right, active caspase 3-positive cells were counted and plotted. Results of d
and e were expressed as means ± SD of 3 independent experiments. **, P <0.01.
