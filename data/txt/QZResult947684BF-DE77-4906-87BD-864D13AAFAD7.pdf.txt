Abstract
Based on the crystal structure of human DNA ligase I
complexed with nicked DNA, computer-aided drug design
was used to identify compounds in a database of 1.5 million
commercially available low molecular weight chemicals that
were predicted to bind to a DNA-binding pocket within the
DNA-binding domain of DNA ligase I, thereby inhibiting DNA
joining. Ten of 192 candidates specifically inhibited purified
human DNA ligase I. Notably, a subset of these compounds
was also active against the other human DNA ligases. Three
compounds that differed in their specificity for the three
human DNA ligases were analyzed further. L82 inhibited DNA
ligase I, L67 inhibited DNA ligases I and III, and L189 inhibited
DNA ligases I, III, and IV in DNA joining assays with purified
proteins and in cell extract assays of DNA replication, base
excision repair, and nonhomologous end-joining. L67 and
L189 are simple competitive inhibitors with respect to nicked
DNA, whereas L82 is an uncompetitive inhibitor that stabilized
complex formation between DNA ligase I and nicked DNA. In
cell culture assays, L82 was cytostatic whereas L67 and L189
were cytotoxic. Concordant with their ability to inhibit DNA
repair in vitro, subtoxic concentrations of L67 and L189
significantly increased the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging
agents. Interestingly, the ligase inhibitors specifically sensitized cancer cells to DNA damage. Thus, these novel human
DNA ligase inhibitors will not only provide insights into the
cellular function of these enzymes but also serve as lead
compounds for the development of anticancer agents. [Cancer

Introduction
Under normal circumstances, the genome is propagated and
maintained by the combination of a highly accurate DNA
replication machinery and a network of DNA repair pathways.
The increased incidence of cancer associated with DNA repair–
deficient human syndromes illustrates the role of these pathways
in protecting against deleterious genetic changes that contribute to
cancer formation. Conversely, many cancer therapeutic agents

exert their cytotoxic effects by damaging DNA. Unfortunately, these
agents also kill normal cells, thereby limiting their utility. There is
growing interest in the identification of DNA repair inhibitors that
will enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents because
combinations of DNA-damaging agents and DNA repair inhibitors
have the potential to concomitantly increase the killing of cancer
cells and reduce damage to normal tissues and cells if either the
damaging agent or the inhibitor could be selectively delivered to
the cancer cells (1).
Because DNA ligation is required during replication and is the
last step of almost all DNA repair pathways, DNA ligase–deficient
cell lines exhibit sensitivity to a wide range of DNA-damaging
agents (2). Thus, DNA ligase inhibitors are predicted to have
pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation and sensitivity to DNA
damage. Human cells contain multiple species of ATP-dependent
DNA ligase encoded by three genes, LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4 (2).
Although these enzymes have a conserved catalytic domain and
use the same reaction mechanism, they are directed to participate
in different DNA transactions by specific protein-protein interactions (2). To date, experimental screening of a synthetic chemical
collection and a natural product library has led to the identification
of several compounds that inhibit human DNA ligase I (hLigI)
in vitro, although these compounds have not been fully characterized in terms of their specificity and mechanism of action (3, 4).
A problem with the screening of random chemical libraries for
DNA ligase inhibitors is that many of the hits are likely to be
nonspecific inhibitors that either bind to the DNA substrate or are
nucleotide analogues that inhibit a large number of ATP-dependent
enzymes. Recently, a crystal structure of hLigI complexed with
nicked DNA substrate was determined (5). Notably, this structure
revealed three domains of hLigI that encircle and contact the nicked
DNA. In addition to the adenylation (AdD) and OB-fold (OBD)
domains that constitute the catalytic core of DNA and RNA ligases
as well as other nucleotidyl transferases, hLigI has a DNA-binding
domain (DBD) located NH2-terminal to the catalytic core that is a
conserved feature of eukaryotic DNA ligases (5).
Using the atomic resolution structure of hLig1 complexed with
nicked DNA (5), a rational approach using computer-aided drug
design (CADD) was taken to identify potential inhibitors of hLigI by
virtual screening of a database of commercially available, low
molecular weight chemicals. Subsequent experimental evaluation
of the candidate inhibitors led to the identification and
characterization of novel inhibitors with different specificities for
human DNA ligases I, III, and IV.

Materials and Methods
CADD screening. A DNA-binding pocket between residues Gly448,
Arg451, and Ala455 of the hLigI DBD (5) was chosen as the target for CADD
(6–10). Details of the in silico screening will be described elsewhere.

A total of 233 compounds were selected for biochemical and biological
assays.
Chemicals. Compounds identified by CADD screening were purchased
from ChemBridge, ChemDiv, MayBridge, MDD, Nanosyn, Specs, Timtec, and
Tripos. L189 was from Specs, and L82 and L67 were from Chemdiv. Tenmillimolar stocks were prepared in DMSO and stored at 20jC. The
molecular mass and purity of L67, L82, and L189 were confirmed by mass
spectrometry in the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy facility.
Proteins. Purification of human DNA ligases is described in the
Supplementary Material. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from NEB.
DNA joining assays. Candidate ligase inhibitors identified by CADD
were assayed for their ability to inhibit hLigI and T4 DNA ligase using a
high-throughput, fluorescence energy transfer–based DNA joining assay
(11). Duplicate reactions (30 AL) containing 10 pmol of nicked DNA
substrate and either 0.25 pmol of hLigI or 10 units of T4 DNA ligase were
incubated in the presence or absence of 100 Amol/L of the putative
inhibitor.
A radioactive gel–based DNA ligation assay was performed as previously
described (11). A 25-mer (5¶-CGC CAG GGT TTT CCC AGT CAC GAC C-3¶),
and a 5¶-[32P] end-labeled 18-mer (5¶-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GTG-3¶) were
annealed to a complementary 44-mer oligonucleotide, generating a linear
duplex with a central nick. DNA joining reactions (30 AL) containing
0.5 pmol of labeled DNA substrate, and hLigI (0.02 pmol), hLigIIIh
(0.02 pmol), hLigIV/XRCC4 (0.1 pmol), or T4 DNA ligase (0.02 pmol) in
ligation buffer were incubated in the absence or presence of ligase
inhibitors at 25jC for 30 min.
Assays for steps 2 and 3 of the ligation reaction. To analyze step 2
of the ligation reaction, labeled ligase-AMP intermediates (ref. 11; 10 pmol)
were incubated overnight at 25jC with an unlabeled nonligatable version
(dideoxy residue at the 3¶-terminus of the nick) of the DNA oligonucleotide
substrate (10 pmol), either in the presence or absence of the ligase
inhibitors (100 Amol/L).
To analyze step 3 of the ligation reaction, an adenylated labeled version
of the 18-mer was prepared as described (12). The DNA substrate
containing a preadenylated nick (0.5 pmol) and hLigI (0.05 pmol), hLigIIIh
(0.05 pmol), hLigIV/XRCC4 (0.1 pmol), or T4 DNA ligase (0.05 pmol) were
incubated in ligation buffer without ATP, either in the presence or absence
of the ligase inhibitors (100 Amol/L). Reactions were stopped by the
addition of an equal volume of gel loading dye (95% formamide, 0.05%
bromophenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). After heating at 95jC for
5 min, DNA was separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeled oligonucleotides were detected and quantitated in the dried
gel by phosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).
Kinetic analysis of ligase inhibitors. To measure the initial rates of
ligation, hLigI (0.05 pmol) was incubated with 0.5 to 100 pmol of the
fluorescent, nicked DNA substrate and various concentrations of the ligase
inhibitors. Ki values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal
plots and curve-fitting using PRISM v3.03 (GraphPad).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A labeled linear duplex with a
nonligatable nick was incubated with hLig1 in ligation buffer (30 AL total
volume) with or without ligase inhibitors for 120 min at 25jC. After the
addition of an equal volume of native gel buffer [160 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
6.8), 20% glycerol, 1.4 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromophenol
blue], samples were separated by electrophoresis through a 12% native
polyacrylamide gel and detected in the dried gel by phosphorImager
analysis.
Cell extract assay of DNA replication and repair. Extracts were
prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (13, 14). For base
excision repair (BER) assays, the extraction buffer contained 100 mmol/L of
KCl, whereas for nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) assays, extraction
buffer contained 400 mmol/L of KCl. Where indicated, DNA ligases
were immunodepleted from the extracts as described (15) using protein A
or G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and anti-Lig1, anti-LigIII (GeneTex),
or anti-LigIV (ABCAM) antibodies. Depletion was confirmed by immunoblotting.
A labeled 5¶-flap substrate (0.1 pmol; ref. 14) was incubated with 20 Ag of
extract in the absence or presence of ligase inhibitors (100 Amol/L) at

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

25jC for 5 min in ligation buffer ( final volume, 50 AL). For short patch BER,
a linear duplex containing a single uracil residue was preincised by
treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase and APE1 (both from NEB) to
generate a strand break with 3¶ hydroxyl and 5¶ deoxyribose phosphate
termini. Reactions (50 AL) containing 0.3 pmol of the incised DNA substrate,
10 ACi of [a32P]dTTP, and 20 Ag of extract either in the absence or presence
of ligase inhibitors (100 Amol/L) were incubated at 25jC for 2 min in
ligation buffer. After separation by denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, labeled oligonucleotides were detected in the dried gel by
phosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).
To assay NHEJ (13), a 1 kb end-labeled BamHI fragment (0.1 pmol;
ref. 16). and 20 Ag of extract were incubated in ligation buffer ( final volume,
20 AL), for 120 min at 25jC either in the presence or absence of ligase
inhibitors (100 Amol/L). DNA fragments were resolved by separation
through a 0.8% agarose gel. Labeled DNA fragments were detected in the
dried gel by phosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics).
Cell culture assays. The culture conditions for normal human breast
epithelial MCF10A cells, human colon cancer HCT116 cells, human cervical
cancer HeLa cells, and human breast cancer MCF7 cells are described in the
Supplementary Material. Assays to measure cell proliferation and survival
and the effect of the ligase inhibitors on cell cycle progression assays were
carried out as described in the Supplementary Material.
Immunocytochemistry. The effect of ligase inhibitors on the subcellular
distribution of tubulin was examined by fluorescence microscopy as
described in the Supplementary Material.

Results
In silico screening for putative DNA ligase inhibitors.
Because the DBD is the predominant DNA-binding activity within
hLigI (5), and both the AdD and OBD are likely to undergo
significant conformational changes during the ligation reaction (2),
we chose a DNA-binding pocket between residues Gly448, Arg451,
and Ala455 of the DBD (Fig. 1A) for the initial CADD screen. A
database of 1.5 million commercially available, low molecular
weight chemicals was subjected to an in silico screen for molecules
that may bind within the DNA-binding pocket using the program
DOCK (6–10). From this virtual screen, a total of 233 compounds
were selected for biochemical and biological assays.
In vitro screening of putative hLigI inhibitors. Of the 233
compounds selected from the in silico screen, 192 compounds were
available from commercial sources. Using a fluorescence-based
DNA joining assay (11), these compounds were assayed at
100 Amol/L for their ability to inhibit purified hLigI (Fig. S1). To
eliminate compounds that nonspecifically inhibit DNA joining, the
same 192 compounds were also assayed for their ability to inhibit
T4 DNA ligase, an enzyme that uses the same reaction mechanism
as hLigI, has similar AdD and OBDs but lacks a DBD (2, 5). Under
these conditions, 10 compounds inhibited hLigI activity by >50%
but had no significant effect on T4 DNA ligase. Thus, the overall hit
rate for specific inhibitors of hLigI from the in silico database
screen was f5%.
Effect of hLigI inhibitors on DNA joining by human DNA
ligases III and IV. Because the DNA-binding pocket within the
DBD of hLigI that was used as the target for CADD is likely to be
conserved in human DNA ligases III (hLigIII) and IV (hLigIV),
we determined whether the inhibitors of hLigI also inhibit DNA
joining by purified hLigIIIh and hLigIV/XRCC4 (Fig. S1). Based
on the inhibition profile of each compound for the three human
DNA ligases, the 10 compounds originally identified as inhibitors of
hLigI were divided into three groups, and one member of each
group was chosen for further analysis. The chemical structures and
predicted binding of the three chosen compounds, L67, L82, and

C, representative gels of DNA ligation assays. The
results of three independent experiments are shown
graphically. For clarity, the data for T4 DNA ligase,
which was not significantly inhibited, was omitted
(hLigI, 5; hLigIIIh, o; hLigIV/XRCC4, 5).

L189 to the DNA-binding pocket within the DBD of hLigI, are
shown in Fig. 1. L189 inhibited hLigI, hLigIIIh, and hLigIV/XRCC4;
L67 inhibited hLigI and hLigIIIh; and L82 only inhibited hLigI
(Fig. 1C). The IC50 values of L67, L82, and L189 for the three human
DNA ligases and T4 DNA ligase are shown in Table S1.
Effect of the ligase inhibitors on the three steps of the
ligation reaction. The ligase inhibitors had no detectable effect on
formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP intermediate, which occurs
independently of the DNA substrate and involves the active site
lysine residue within the AdD of DNA ligases (17), by the three
human DNA ligases (Fig. S2). To examine the second step of the
ligation reaction, DNA ligases with a covalently linked labeled AMP
moiety were incubated with an unlabeled linear DNA substrate
containing a single nonligatable nick (Fig. 2A). Transfer of the
labeled AMP moiety to the 5¶-phosphate terminus of the nick
results in the formation of a labeled DNA-adenylate intermediate.
In accord with the results of the DNA joining assays (Fig. 1C), L189
inhibited step 2 of the reaction catalyzed by all three human DNA
ligases by at least 90%, but had only a minor effect on T4 DNA

ligase. DNA-adenylate formation by hLigI was inhibited by L189
in a concentration-dependent manner with an estimated IC50 of
f7 Amol/L (Fig. S3). Although less effective than L189, L67 and L82
also inhibited step 2 of the reaction and reiterated the specificity
for the human DNA ligases observed in the DNA joining assays
(Fig. 1C). L67, which inhibited DNA joining by hLigI and hLigIIIh
but not hLig IV/XRCC4 (Fig. 1C), was more effective at inhibiting
DNA-adenylate formation by hLigI and hLigIIIh compared with
hLig IV/XRCC4 or T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 2A). Similarly, L82, which
specifically inhibited DNA joining by hLigI, was more effective at
inhibiting DNA-adenylate formation by this enzyme compared with
hLigIII, hLigIV, and T4 DNA ligase (Fig. 2A).
In the third and final step of the ligation reaction, the
nonadenylated enzyme catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation,
releasing AMP. Similar to the second step, L67, L82, and L189
generated the same pattern of inhibition of the third step of the
ligation reaction catalyzed by the three human DNA ligases and T4
DNA ligase (Fig. 2B) as was observed in the DNA joining assays
(Fig. 1C). L67 and L82 were more effective inhibitors of step 3 than

ligase-adenylate forms of hLigI (I ), hLigIIIh (III ), hLigIV (IV ), and T4 (T4 ) DNA ligase were incubated with a linear DNA substrate containing a single nonligatable

step 2, whereas the opposite was the case for L189. Thus, as
expected, the inhibitors target the steps of the ligation reaction in
which the enzyme interacts with nicked DNA.
Kinetic analysis of the inhibition of DNA joining: effect of
the inhibitors on binding to nicked DNA. To further characterize
the inhibition of hLigI, we measured the kinetics of DNA joining in
the absence or the presence of L67, L82, and L189. For L67 (Fig. 3A,
middle) and L189 (Fig. 3A, left), the resulting Lineweaver-Burk
plots indicate that these compounds are simple competitive inhibitors with respect to the DNA substrate, with Ki values of 10 and
5 Amol/L, respectively. Because a DNA-binding pocket within the
DBD of hLigI was used for the in silico modeling, it seems likely
that L67 and L189 compete with DNA for binding to this site. To
provide direct evidence for this, we performed electrophoretic
mobility shift assays using a linear DNA molecule containing a
nonligatable nick. As predicted, the addition of L189 (Fig. 3B)
reduced the amount of hLigI-DNA complex. Similar results were
obtained with the DBD of hLigI (Fig. S4). L67 was much less
effective than L189 at inhibiting formation of the hLigI-DNA
complex (data not shown). This may reflect the fact that L189,
which is a better inhibitor of step 2 than step 3 of the ligation
reaction (Fig. 2), acts at an earlier stage in the interaction with DNA
than L67, which is a better inhibitor of step 3 than step 2. The
inhibitory effect of L67 on step 3 of the ligation reaction was
reduced by increasing the concentration of DNA-adenylate,
confirming that L67 is a competitive inhibitor (Fig. S5).
The Lineweaver-Burk plots obtained with L82 (Fig. 3A, right) are
strikingly different than those obtained with L67 (Fig. 3A, middle)
and L189 (Fig. 3A, left), and indicate that this compound acts

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

uncompetitively. In accord with the prediction that L82 binds
specifically to the enzyme-substrate complex, L82 increased the
amount of hLigI-nicked DNA complex formed in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 3C). These results provide evidence that
the inhibitors interact with the DBD and inhibit ligation either by
blocking DNA-binding (L67 and L189) or stabilizing a reaction
intermediate (L82).
Effect of ligase inhibitors on cell extract assays of DNA
replication and repair. Cell extract assays for DNA replication
and various DNA repair pathways have been developed and used to
identify and purify the protein factors involved in these DNA
transactions (13, 18–20). To determine whether L67, L82, and L189
retain their activity and specificity in cell extracts, we examined
DNA replication and repair pathways for which there is an
established cell extract assay (13, 21–23), and the DNA ligase
involved has been identified by complementary genetic and
biochemical evidence (13, 21, 24–27). During Okazaki fragment
processing and the long patch subpathway of BER, short 5¶ singlestrand flaps are removed and the resulting nicks ligated by the
sequential action of FEN-1 and hLigI. In Fig. 4A, we show the
processing and joining of a DNA flap substrate, which mimics a
common pathway intermediate, by a HeLa cell extract. As expected,
immunodepletion of hLigI but not hLigIIIa reduced the amount of
ligated product (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2, 6, and 7). The addition of
L67, L82, and L189, each of which inhibits purified hLigI (Fig. 1C),
reduced the amount of ligated product (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–5). Notably,
an intermediate generated by flap removal accumulated in these
reactions, and the reaction with the extract immunodepleted hLigI,
indicating that the ligase inhibitors do not inhibit FEN-1.

DNA Ligase Inhibitors

The DNA ligase IIIa/XRCC1 complex is the predominant DNA
ligase activity responsible for completing the short patch subpathway of BER following insertion of a single nucleotide and removal
of the 5¶ deoxyribose phosphate by DNA polh (27). In Fig. 4B, we
show the processing and joining of a pathway intermediate, a DNA
duplex with an incised abasic site, by a HeLa extract. As expected,
immunodepletion of hLigIIIa, but not hLigI, reduced the amount of
the ligated product (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 5, and 6). L67 and L189, which
are active against hLigIII, inhibited the formation of the repaired
product (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3), whereas, L82, the hLigI-specific
inhibitor, had no effect (Fig. 4B, lane 4). The ligase inhibitors had
no detectable effect on gap-filling synthesis by polh which
generates a labeled 31-mer (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained
with DNA substrates containing larger gaps that were filled by DNA
poly and/or polq (data not shown). Thus, the ligase inhibitors do
not negatively affect gap-filling synthesis by the major DNA
polymerases involved in DNA replication and excision repair.
NHEJ is the major pathway for the repair of DNA doublestrand breaks in human cells. In a cell extract assay that
measures joining of cohesive-ended linear DNA fragments and is
dependent on the key NHEJ factors, Ku, DNA-PKcs, and hLigIV/
XRCC4 (13), L189, the only inhibitor with activity against hLigIV
(Fig. 1C), was the only compound to inhibit end-joining by the
HeLa cell extract (Fig. 4C, compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6).
As expected, immunodepletion of hLigIV abolished end-joining
(Fig. 4C, lane 9) whereas immunodepletion of either hLigI or
hLigIIIa had no significant effect (Fig. 4C, lanes 7 and 8), confirming
that the majority of DNA joining events were catalyzed by hLigIV/
XRCC4. Together, these results show that the ligase inhibitors retain
their specificity for the different species of DNA ligases in cell
extracts and thus can be used to determine the contributions of

individual human DNA ligase(s) to DNA repair pathways in cell
extracts or partially purified fractions.
Effects of ligase inhibitors on cultured human cells. If L67,
L82, and L189 enter human cells, it is likely that they will inhibit
proliferation and may be cytotoxic because they all inhibit hLigI,
the major replicative DNA ligase. As shown in Fig. 5A, each of
the compounds reduced the proliferation and/or viability of four
human cell lines, including a normal breast epithelial cell line
MCF10A and the cancer cell lines MCF7, HeLa, and HCT116
established from breast, cervical, and colon cancers, respectively,
in a concentration-dependent manner. In colony-forming assays,
L67 and L189 were cytotoxic (Figs. 5B and 6A), whereas L82 was
cytostatic, reducing the size but not the number of colonies formed
by MCF7 (Fig. 5B) and the other cell lines (data not shown).
To determine the effects of L82 on cell cycle progression,
asynchronous MCF7 cells were enriched for the G0-G1 phase by
serum starvation and then released into serum-containing medium
either with or without 50 Amol/L of L82. In the presence of L82,
there was a transient accumulation of cells at G2-M after 12 hours
followed by an accumulation at G0-G1 that peaked after 24 hours
and then remained relatively stable (Fig. 5C). Because the increase
in the G0-G1 fraction occurred concomitantly with a decrease in the
S phase cell fraction (Fig. 5C), it seems that the cytostatic activity of
L82 is primarily due to activation of the G1-S checkpoint. In accord
with this conclusion, >80% of the cells treated with 50 Amol/L of
L82 had enlarged nuclei and a single centrosome, morphologic
characteristics of G0-G1 cells (Fig. 5D, compare top and bottom).
Moreover, deformed nuclei and abnormal spindle separation
occurred in cells treated with 10 Amol/L of L82 (Fig. 5D, middle)
even though this lower concentration had much less of an effect on
cell cycle distribution (data not shown).

substrate. Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots of initial reaction velocity (1/V ) versus substrate concentration (1/S ). B, a labeled linear substrate with a single

and 7) in the absence () or presence (+) of 100 Amol/L of L189. C, a labeled linear substrate with a single nonligatable nick (1 pmol) and hLigI (3 pmol) were

hLigIIIa (lane 8, III-dp ), and hLigIV (lane 9, IV-dp ) were
immunodepleted from the cell extracts prior to
incubation with the DNA substrate. Lane 1, molecular

(Sub ). The positions of the DNA substrate and dimers
and multimers of the substrate are indicated.

In contrast with the cytostatic activity of L82, treatment of
normal and cancer cells with either L67 or L189 (Fig. 6A) resulted
in a concentration-dependent reduction in cell survival. Cells with
a DNA content of less than 2n, indicative of apoptosis, were
detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting after treatment with
either L67 or L189. This was confirmed by the detection of the
chromosome fragmentation pattern characteristic of apoptotic cell
death (data not shown).
Because DNA ligase–deficient mammalian cells exhibit increased
sensitivity to DNA damage (2), we determined whether exposure to
subtoxic concentrations of ligase inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents. L67 markedly increased the
killing of MCF7 breast cancer cells by the DNA alkylating agent,
methyl methane sulfonate (Fig. 6B, left). Similar results were obtained with the other cancer cell lines, HCT116 and HeLa (data not
shown). Notably, the presence of L67 had no obvious effect on the
sensitivity of normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells to DNA alkylation (Fig. 6B, left). L189 also enhanced the killing of cancer cell
lines but not the normal cell line by MMS (data not shown).
Furthermore, L189 markedly increased the killing of HCT116 colon
cancer cells (Fig. 6B, right) and the other cancer cell lines (data not
shown) by ionizing radiation. Once again, the ligase inhibitor had
very little effect on the sensitivity of normal breast epithelial
MCF10A cells to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (Fig. 6B,
right). Similarly, L67 enhanced the killing of the cancer cell lines but
not the normal cell line by ionizing radiation (data not shown).
The ability of ligase inhibitors to specifically sensitize cancer
cells to DNA damage prompted us to compare the levels of DNA
ligases in the normal and cancer cell lines. As expected (28), the
level of hLigI was elevated in the cancer cell lines compared with
the normal cell line (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, there were changes in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

the levels of hLigIIIa and hLigIV in the cancer cell lines compared
with the normal cell line (Fig. 6C). Specifically, the levels of hLigIIIa
were elevated, whereas the levels of hLigIV were markedly reduced
in the three cancer cell lines, suggesting that these reciprocal
changes in the levels of hLigIIIa and hLigIV may be a characteristic
feature of cancer cells.

Discussion
There is emerging interest in the development and use of
therapeutics that target DNA repair pathways in the treatment of
cancer (1). Because almost all DNA repair pathways are completed
by a ligation event, the DNA ligases encoded by the three human
LIG genes are attractive therapeutic targets. In this study, we have
identified novel small molecule inhibitors of the human DNA
ligases using CADD. Specifically, 1.5 million commercially available
low molecular weight compounds were screened in silico for their
ability to potentially bind to a DNA-binding pocket within the DBD
domain of hLigI (5). Notably, 5% of the compounds identified by
the CADD screen inhibited DNA joining by hLigI but not T4 DNA
ligase, confirming the utility of this structure-based approach.
In accord with the selection of the DBD of hLigI as the target for
CADD, the three compounds that have been most extensively
characterized inhibit the second and third steps of the ligation
reaction in which the enzyme interacts with nicked DNA.
Interestingly, L189 preferentially inhibits step 2 whereas the other
two compounds, L67 and L82, preferentially inhibit step 3. This
may reflect differences in the conformation of the DBD and/or the
position of the DNA substrate during steps 2 and 3 of the ligation
reaction. Moreover, these results raise the possibility of generating
step 2–specific and step 3–specific inhibitors that could be used to

DNA Ligase Inhibitors

gain more detailed insights into the ligation reaction. As expected,
two of the compounds, L67 and L189, were competitive inhibitors
with respect to the nicked DNA substrate, indicating that their
binding to the DBD of hLigI prevents interaction with nicked DNA.
In contrast, L82 is an uncompetitive inhibitor, analogous to the
prototypic topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (29, 30).
Camptothecin and other topoisomerase I inhibitors function as
uncompetitive inhibitors by stabilizing the covalent linkage of
topoisomerase I with the cleaved DNA, simultaneously binding to
topoisomerase I and stacking within DNA base pairs adjacent to
the cleavage site (31, 32). Because both human topoisomerase I and
hLigI encircle and interact with nicked DNA (33), it is possible that
L82 simultaneously contacts the DNA and DBD within the context
of the ring structure formed by hLigI on nicked DNA.
Because the DBD is conserved among human DNA ligases, we
examined whether the hLigI inhibitors were also active against
hLigIII and hLigIV. Examples of compounds that were either
specific for hLigI (L82), specific for hLigI and hLigIII (L67), or
inhibited all the human DNA ligases (L189) were identified. These
results raise the possibility that the CADD approach may identify
compounds that are specific for hLigIII and hLigIV. The availability
of inhibitors that target each of the human DNA ligases will

facilitate studies to identify the DNA ligase(s) in cell extracts
participating in different DNA transactions. This has been
problematic because of the larger repertoire of DNA ligases in
mammals compared with lower eukaryotes, in particular, the
multiple isoforms encoded by the LIG3 gene (2) and the absence of
viable lig3 mutant cell lines (34). Indeed, recent studies have
implicated DNA ligase IIIa in nucleotide excision repair (35) and
an alternative NHEJ pathway (36), in addition to its previously
known roles in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and the
short patch subpathway of BER (37).
Inhibitors that block ligation in vivo will be valuable reagents for
elucidating the cellular functions of human DNA ligases. L67, L82,
and L189, each of which inhibit hLig1, the replicative DNA ligase,
all reduced cell proliferation and viability, indicating that they cross
the cell membrane. Surprisingly, although L67 and L189 were
cytotoxic, L82 was cytostatic. Because L82 is specific for hLigI, it is
possible that hLigIIIa, which is also inhibited by L67 and L189, is
required for cell viability either in the presence of normal levels of
hLigI or specifically when hLigI activity is reduced. Alternatively,
the differing effects of the inhibitors in vivo may reflect the
uncompetitive mode of inhibition by L82 compared with L67 and
L189, which are competitive inhibitors.

Figure 5. Characterization of the cytostatic effect of
L82. A, MCF10A (n), MCF7 ( w ), HCT116 (E), and
HeLa (!) cells were plated in the absence or presence
of L82 (left ), L67 (middle ), and L189 (right ). After
6 days, cell viability was measured and is expressed as
a percentage of the value obtained with untreated cells.
B, MCF7 cells were plated out in the absence or
presence of L82 (top ) and L67 (bottom ) at the
indicated concentrations. After 2 weeks, colonies were
stained with crystal violet. C, after serum starvation
for 4 days, MCF 7 cells were returned to
serum-containing media either without (5) or with
50 Amol/L of L82 (.). The cell cycle distribution at
various time intervals was determined by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting. D, asynchronous
populations of MCF cells were either untreated (top ) or
treated with L82 at 10 Amol/L (middle ) and 50 Amol/L
(bottom ). After 3 days, tubulin and DNA were
visualized by fluorescence microscopy (bars, 0.5 mm).

Figure 6. L67 and L189 are cytotoxic and potentiate the cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents: altered levels of DNA ligase in cancer cells. A, effect of L67
(left) and L189 (right ) on the survival of MCF7 (4), HCT116 (5), HeLa ( w ), and MCF10A (5) cells. B, normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells (open symbols ) and
breast cancer MCF7 cells (filled symbols ) in the absence (circles ) or presence of 3 Amol/L of L67 (squares ) were exposed to increasing concentrations of MMS (left ).
Normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells (open symbols ) and colon cancer HCT116 cells (filled symbols ) in the absence (circles ) or presence of 20 Amol/L of L189
(squares ) were exposed to increasing doses of ionizing radiation (right ). C, hLigI (I ), hLigIIIa (III), and hLigIV (IV ) were detected in extracts (400 Ag) of the indicated
cell lines by immunoblotting. To control for extract loading, h-actin was also detected by immunoblotting.

The hypersensitivity of DNA ligase–deficient cell lines to DNA
damage (2) and the ability of the ligase inhibitors to inhibit BER
and NHEJ in vitro suggested that subtoxic levels of DNA ligase
inhibitors may significantly increase cell killing by DNA-damaging
agents. In support of this idea, L67 and L189 increased DNA
damage–induced cytotoxicity. Strikingly, the increased cytotoxicity
occurred in cancer cell lines but not in a cell line established from
normal breast epithelium. Differences in the level of DNA ligases
may underlie the selective effect of the ligase inhibitors on the
cancer cell lines. Because unregulated proliferation is a characteristic of cancer, it was not surprising that the level of the replicative
DNA ligase, hLigI, was significantly higher in all three cancer cell
lines compared with the normal breast epithelial cell line. Notably,
the cancer cell lines also had elevated levels of hLigIIIa but reduced
levels of hLigIV. It is not known which, if any, of these changes is
responsible for the specific sensitization of the cancer cells to DNA
damage in the presence of a ligase inhibitor.
The reciprocal change in the levels of hLigIIIa and IV was also
observed in cell lines with the bcr-abl translocation established
from acute myelogenous leukemias but not in comparable normal
cells,5 suggesting that this may be a characteristic feature of
malignant cells. Because NHEJ is a major pathway for repairing
DNA double-strand breaks, the reduced levels of hLigIV may
explain, at least in part, the increased sensitivity of cancer cells to
ionizing radiation and suggest that cancer cell lines may be more
susceptible to radiosensitization by a hLigIV inhibitor. In addition,

the reduced levels of DNA ligase IV may result in more DNA
double-strand breaks being repaired by an error-prone DNA ligase
III–dependent back-up NHEJ pathway, contributing to the
increased genome instability that is a hallmark of cancer cells (38).
Differences in the network of pathways that maintain genome
stability between cancer and normal cells constitute an opportunity to develop therapies that specifically target cancer cells. For
example, loss of the function of either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor
suppressor genes results in defective homologous recombination
(39–41). As a consequence of this abnormality, brca cancer cell
lines are hypersensitive to killing by inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (42, 43). Thus, the availability of a repertoire of
inhibitors targeting different DNA repair pathways is likely to lead
to the development of novel combinations of DNA-damaging
agents and DNA repair inhibitors that exploit differences in the
DNA repair properties of normal and cancer cells. Because of the
multiplicity of human DNA ligases and the almost ubiquitous
requirement for DNA joining to complete DNA repair, DNA ligase
inhibitors have the potential to target one or different combinations of DNA repair pathways.
In conclusion, we have used an in silico screening approach
based on the structure of hLigI complexed with nicked DNA to
identify low molecular weight inhibitors of human DNA ligases that
specifically block functional interactions between these enzymes
and nicked DNA. This is not only the first example of this type of
inhibitor but also the first characterization of a set of inhibitors
with different specificities for the three human DNA ligases that
can be used to identify the DNA ligase(s) acting in extract-based
assays of replication and repair. In addition to their in vitro
activities, the selected ligase inhibitors inhibit cell proliferation
and, at subtoxic concentrations, they specifically potentiate the

killing of cancer cells by DNA-damaging agents. Thus, these
inhibitors are promising lead compounds for the development of
novel therapeutic agents to treat human cancer.
