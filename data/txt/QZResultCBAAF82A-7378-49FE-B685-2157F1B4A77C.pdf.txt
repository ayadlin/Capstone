Abstract
Cancer stem–like cells (CSC) may be critical to maintain the
malignant behavior of solid and hematopoietic cancers.
Recently, patients with endometrial cancer whose tumors
expressed high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a
detoxifying enzyme characteristic of many progenitor and stem
cells, exhibited a relative reduction in survival compared with
patients with low levels of ALDH. Given evidence of its role as a
CSC marker, we hypothesized that high level of ALDH activity
(ALDHhi) in a tumor might positively correlate with the presence of stem- and progenitor-like tumor cells in this disease
setting. In support of this hypothesis, ALDH could be used to
enrich for CSC in endometrial cancer cell lines and primary
tumors, as illustrated by the increased tumor-initiating capacity

of ALDHhi cells in immunodeﬁcient mice. ALDHhi cells also
exhibited greater clonogenic and organoid-forming capacity
compared with ALDHlo cells. Notably, the number of
ALDHhi cells in tumor cell lines and primary tumors inversely
correlated with differentiation grade. Expression analysis
revealed upregulation of IL6 receptor subunits and signal
transducers CD126 and GP130 in ALDHhi endometrial cancer
cells. Accordingly, targeted inhibition of the IL6 receptor and its
downstream effectors JAK1 and STAT3 dramatically reduced
tumor cell growth. Overall, our results provide a preclinical
rationale to target IL6 or its effector functions as a novel
therapeutic option in endometrial cancer. Cancer Res; 75(17);

Introduction

isms (2), including the increased expression of detoxifying
enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenease (ALDH). Upon chemotherapy and irradiation, ALDH alters aldehydes (oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen) within a cell to prevent DNA damage.
Increased ALDH enzyme activity has been found in CSCs in
colon, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers (3–5). In addition,
increased mRNA expression of the ALDH1 gene in endometrial
cancer has been detected, and its expression level negatively
correlates with overall survival (6).
The cellular activity and the relative multiplicity of CSCs within
a tumor are likely regulated by signals from the tumor microenvironment. In endometrial cancer, high levels of IL6 were found to
negatively correlate with overall survival (7). IL6 is secreted upon
tissue injury and stress (8). Although innate immune cells represent the major IL6 source within the tumor microenvironment,
tumor cells were also shown to express IL6 in autocrine fashion.
Upon its secretion, IL6 binds to its receptor (IL6Ra or CD126).
CD126 encompasses a short cytoplasmic domain that interacts
with the ubiquitously expressed second transducer GP130. Binding of IL6 to CD126 and their association with GP130 triggers the
activation of Janus kinases (JAK), which phosphorylate STAT3,
thus modulating the expression of a broad spectrum of downstream target genes (9). Recent studies showed that IL6 and its
downstream effector STAT3 are highly expressed in therapyinsensitive endometrial cancers and overall represent poor prognosis indicators for this type of uterine malignancies (7, 10, 11).
Here, we took advantage of ALDH enzymatic activity as a marker
to enrich for CSCs in human endometrial cancer cell lines and

In general, malignancies are thought to have a hierarchical
organization with cancer stem cells (CSC), endowed with selfrenewal and differentiation capacity, which continuously fuel
tumor growth through unbalanced symmetric (giving rise to more
CSCs) and asymmetric (generating more committed progenitors
and differentiated cells) cell divisions (1). In view of their central
role in underlying malignant behavior and of their intrinsic
resistance to cytotoxic treatments, CSCs have received much
attention as a unique target for the development of novel tailor-made therapeutic approaches. Resistance of CSCs to conventional therapies has been shown to result from multiple mechan-

IL6 Signaling in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells

primary tumors and to identify novel prognostic markers and
therapeutic targets.

Materials and Methods
Animals
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1WjI/SzJ (NSG) mice were bred and
maintained in the Erasmus MC animal facility (EDC) under
standard conditions. All protocols involving animals were
approved by the Dutch Animal Experimental Committee and
were conform to the Code of Practice for Animal Experiments in
Cancer Research established by the Netherlands Inspectorate for
Health Protection, Commodities and Veterinary Public Health
(The Hague, the Netherlands, 1999).
Primary tumor collection
For the aims of this study, established cell lines and hysterectomy resection specimens from patients were used. Only tumors
from patients where no neoadjuvant chemo- and/or radiation
therapy was applied were considered for the transplantation
experiments. Tumor samples were obtained from resection specimens upon arrival at the Department of Pathology, according to
the Code of Conduct for Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue
established by the Dutch Federation of Medical Scientiﬁc Societies. The following primary tumor samples were used to generate
endometrial cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) by transplantation and propagation in NSG immunodeﬁcient mice
(NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ): HET-01 [grade I, well-differentiated, estrogen receptor (ER)þ, progesterone receptor (PR)þ];
HET-02 (grade II, intermediate differentiation grade, ER, PR);
HET-04 (grade III, poorly differentiated, ER, PR); HET-07
(grade I, well-differentiated, ERþ, PRþ); and HET-10 (grade I,
well-differentiated, ERþ, PRþ).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version
16; SPSS). Differences between groups were analyzed using the
Kruskal–Wallis statistical test. When P < 0.05, the Dunn multiple
comparison was performed and, upon conﬁrmation, P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. If only two groups were analyzed, a t test was performed, and a result of P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Cell lines and culture
HEC1B, HEC1A, RL952, and Isihikawa cell lines were obtained
from ATCC and ECACC and cultured in DMEM containing 5%
FCS and penicillin/streptomycin, or in serum-free stem cell media
[DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% v/v B27, 20 ng/mL basic FGF
(bFGF), 20 ng/mL EGF, 100 mg/mL gentamycin]. The identity of
each of the cell lines used was conﬁrmed by DNA ﬁngerprinting
with 13 microsatellite markers (Amel, CSF1PO, D2S1338,
D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51,
D19S433, D21S11, FGA, THO1, TPOX, vWA) and comparison
with the analogous data provided by ATCC and ECACC. Notably,
although no PR expression was found in the tumors derived from
the HEC1A cells, the ATCC datasheet relative to this cell line states
its PRþ status.
Flow cytometry and in vivo transplantation assays
To further purify primary tumor cells from contaminating
components, we used antibodies raised against well-character-

ized endothelial (CD31-APC; BD Biosciences) and hematologic
(CD45-APC, TER119-APC; BD Biosciences) lineage (Lin) antigens to deplete Linþ cells by gating the CD31/CD45 (Lin)
population (12). CD133þ cells were detected with the CD133/
2-APC (293C3; MACS), according to the manufacturer's
instruction. Dead cell discrimination was performed with
Hoechst 33258 (1:10,000; Invitrogen). Single-cell suspensions
of Lin tumor cells (i.e., enriched for epithelial cells) and cell
lines were stained with ALDH reagents (Aldeﬂuor, STEMCELL
Technologies Inc.) alone and in combination with CD126-PE
(BD Biosciences). Labeled cells were either used for analysis or
sorting. FACS was performed with a FACSAria Cell Sorting
System (BD Biosciences). Cells were sorted into DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. After
sorting, cells were centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 10 minutes,
resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and subcutaneously
injected into <12-week-old NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/
SzJ) female mice in a 100 mL volume. The relative frequency of
CSCs in endometrial cancer was estimated by limiting dilution
analysis. The size (volume) of the resulting tumors was calculated according to the formula V ¼ (ab2)/2, where a and b are
the longest and shortest tumor diameters, respectively (13).
Data are given in mm3.
The following small-molecule inhibitors and chemotherapeutics were used: nifuroxazide (VETRANAL) was from SigmaAldrich; ruxolitinib was from Invivogen; and cisplatin was from
Selleckchem.com. All chemicals were dissolved in DMSO and
diluted to keep DMSO at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1% in all the
samples.
IHC analysis
Parafﬁn sections (5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) or antibodies directed against ERa (clone 1D5,
1:100), PR (clone PgR636, 1:100), and Ki67 (clone TEC-3,
M7249, 1:200; Dako). Subsequently, sections were stained
using the EnVision system Kit (Dako), counterstained with
hematoxylin, and scanned with an NDP slide scanner (Hamamatsu). Quantiﬁcation of ER and PR staining was done by
counting positive cells in three independent sections from each
individual tumor (ImageJ software; NIH, Bethesda, MD). The
numbers of positive cells were counted per high-power ﬁeld at a
10 magniﬁcation, throughout the entire section.
Single-cell suspensions
To obtain single-cell suspensions for FACS analysis, cell lines
were trypsinized in 0.05 mmol/L EDTA, whereas tumor tissues
were dissociated both mechanically and enzymatically. Brieﬂy,
tumor tissue specimens were digested for 20 minutes at 37 C with
DNAse I (50 U/mL; Roche) and collagenase A (3 mg/mL; SigmaAldrich). Samples were then passed through a 40-mm cell strainer
(BD Biosciences) and the resulting single-cell suspensions used
for further analysis.
In vitro Matrigel assay
After sorting, cells were centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 10
minutes and resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in a 50
mL volume and cultured in 24-well dishes in serum-free
stem cell media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% v/v
B27, 20 ng/mL bFGF, 20 ng/mL EGF, 100 mg/mL gentamycin;
ref. 14).

IL6 Signaling in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells

Clonogenicity assay
Single cells were sorted by FACS in 96-well plates in serumsupplemented growth media. After sorting, each well was
inspected by microscopy for the presence of one cell per well.
After 1 week of culture (37 C, 5% CO2), clonogenicity was
assessed for each cell line and sorted subpopulation by counting
the number of positive wells.
Cell proliferation assay
Sorted cells were seeded in 96-well dishes at 500 cells per well
and cultured in serum-supplemented medium for 70, 120, and
170 hours. At the indicated time points, cells were ﬁxed with 70%
ethanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in water. Crystal
violet was solubilized with acetic acid followed by optical density
(OD) measurement at 570 nm with a microplate reader (BioRad),
as readout for cell growth.
Toxicity assays (MTT)
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the indicated density, left
overnight to allow full recovery and adhesion, and then treated
with cisplatin and/or IL6 pathway inhibitors. Viability was
assayed at time zero and after 3-day treatment using the MTT
viability assay. Brieﬂy, cells were incubated for 3 hours in culture
medium supplemented with 0.45 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich).
The 96-well plates were then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5
minutes and culture medium was removed. MTT formazan precipitates were solubilized with DMSO. OD reading was performed at 490 nm with a microplate reader.
Gene expression analysis
Expression proﬁling analysis was performed with the RT2 Proﬁler Cell Surface Markers PCR Array (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The resulting expression proﬁles were
validated by qPCR, as previously described (15). Expression levels
were normalized for the endogenous reference GAPDH gene.
Primer sequences are speciﬁed in the online Methods section.

Results
The percentage of ALDHhi endometrial cancer cells inversely
correlates with their differentiation status
Previously, it was shown that endometrial cancers expressing
high ALDH1 mRNA levels are characterized by a reduced survival
rate (6). To follow-up on this observation, we further investigated
ALDH enzymatic activity in a panel of four endometrial cancer
cell lines [HEC1A, HEC1B, RL952, and IK (Ishikawa)] and 5
primary tumors (PDX; HET-01, -02, -04, -07, -10) by Aldeﬂuor
reagents followed by ﬂow cytometry analysis. We found that the
percentages of ALDHhi cells in our panel of 4 endometrial cancer
cell lines ranged from 52% in HEC1B to 1% to 2% in IK cells
(Fig. 1A and B). A similarly broad spectrum of ALDH activities
was found among the PDX from primary endometrial tumors

where the percentages of ALDHhi cells ranged from 31% (HET-04)
to 5% (HET-01; Fig. 1A and B).
Next, single-cell suspensions were obtained from the panels of
endometrial cancer cell lines and primary tumors sorted by FACS
(to deplete Linþ and dead cells) and subcutaneously injected into
NSG mice at relatively high multiplicities (104–105) to allow
tumors to develop for histologic analysis. When the tumors
reached a size of approximately 1 cm3, mice were sacriﬁced and
tumors were analyzed by IHC for the expression of ER and PR
(16–18). Tumors derived from the HEC1B and HEC1A cell lines
did not show any ER and PR expression, whereas tumors obtained
from the RL95-2 and IK cell lines did express both hormone
receptors, albeit at different levels (Fig. 1C). Notably, ER/PR
expression was absent in the two cell lines (i.e., HEC1B and
HEC1A) encompassing high percentages of ALDHhi cells, whereas
those with smaller ALDHhi fractions (i.e., RL95-2 and IK) gave rise
to tumors with increased ER/PR expression (Fig. 1C). The same
trend was observed among primary tumors (Fig. 1C).
Overall, these results indicate that the percentage of ALDH cells
in endometrial cell lines and primary tumors inversely correlates
with their ER/PR status and most likely with their differentiation
grade (16–18).
ALDHhi cells are characterized by increased proliferation,
clonogenicity, and organoid-forming capacity
To investigate functional differences between ALDHhi and
ALDHlo endometrial tumor cells, we assessed their proliferation
rate in conventional culture conditions and their capacity to form
self-renewing organoids in serum-free growth conditions.
We ﬁrst stained our panel of endometrial cancer cell lines and
primary tumor cells with Aldeﬂuor reagents, sorted 500 ALDHhi
and ALDHlo cells by FACS into each well of 24-well TC-coated
dishes, and cultured them in serum-supplemented medium for
70, 120, and 170 hrs. Cells were then lysed and measured at
OD450 as a read-out for cell growth. After 170 hours (and in 3 cases
already at 120 hours), ALDHhi cells derived from both endometrial cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed a signiﬁcantly
increased growth rate when compared with ALDHlo cells (Fig. 2A).
Next, we assessed whether, apart from their enhanced growth
rate, ALDHhi endometrial cancer cells were also endowed with
increased clonogenicity when compared with their ALDHlo counterpart. To this aim, single ALDHhi, ALDHlo, and bulk cells were
sorted by FACS into 96-well dishes (a total of 64 wells for each
subpopulation) and cultured in serum-supplemented medium.
As shown in Supplementary Table S1A, ALDHhi cells derived from
our panel of endometrial cancer cell lines show increased clonogenicity when compared with ALDHlo and bulk cells.
To investigate their organoid-forming capacity in 3-dimensional (3D) serum-free conditions, a feature of stem and progenitor
cells, ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells were sorted by FACS and cultured
in Matrigel in stem cell media (i.e., serum-free with speciﬁc growth
factors; ref. 14). As shown in Fig. 2B, ALDHhi cells derived from

IL6 Signaling in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells

both cell lines and primary tumors gave rise to a signiﬁcantly
increased number of organoids when compared with ALDHlo
cells. Also, ALDHhi-derived organoids were of larger size than their
ALDHlo-derived counterparts (Fig. 2C and D). In addition, we also
observed differences in the time needed to initiate organoid
formation among cell lines: whereas HEC1A and HEC1B cells
gave rise to organoids within 8 days of 3D culture, RL95-2 and IK
cells were signiﬁcantly slower (14–21 days; data not shown).
Overall, these results indicate that ALDHhi endometrial cancer
cells from both established cell lines and primary tumors are
characterized by increased proliferative rates, clonogenicity, and
organoid-forming capacity when compared with ALDHlo cells.
Endometrial ALDHhi cancer cells have increased tumorinitiating capacity
The above features of ALDHhi endometrial cancer cells are
indicative of a possible enrichment of CSCs within this subpopulation. To assess the tumor-initiating capacity of these cells,
ALDHhi, ALDHlo, and bulk cells were isolated by FACS from the
panels of endometrial cancer cell lines and primary tumors and
subcutaneously injected into NSG mice at different limiting
dilutions, ranging from 10 to 105. As shown in Table 1, among
the endometrial cancer cell lines, ALDHhi cells clearly showed
increased tumor-forming capacity when compared with bulk and
ALDHlo cells. However, whereas this was evident even at extremely low multiplicities (i.e., 10 and 100 transplanted cells) in the cell
lines characterized by the highest percentages of ALDH-positive
cells (i.e., HEC1B, HEC1A, and RL95-2, giving rise to the least

differentiated tumors), in the case of the IK cell line (i.e., encompassing a small minority of ALDH-positive cells and giving rise to
the most differentiated tumors), ALDHhi cells revealed an
increased tumor-initiating capacity only when higher multiplicities were used (at least 103 injected cells). Lower IK cell multiplicities (10 and 100) did not give rise to any tumor formation
upon transplantation in NSG mice (Table 1, endometrial cancer
cell lines). The same effect was observed among endometrial
cancer cells derived from primary tumors: whereas in the case of
those tumors encompassing more than 10% ALDH-positive cells
(and with a low degree of differentiation), an increased tumorinitiating capacity could be demonstrated at extreme limiting
dilutions (10 and 100 for HET-04, HET-02, and HET-10), the
most differentiated ones with the least ALDH-positive component
(5%; HET-07 and HET-01) revealed increased tumor-forming
activity only when at least 103 cells were injected (Table 1, primary
patient-derived tumors).
Apart from their increased tumor-forming capacity, ALDHhi
cells also initiated subcutaneous tumor growth with a signiﬁcantly shorter latency than observed with ALDHlo cells (Fig. 3A).
Moreover, ALDHhi-derived tumors were considerably larger than
those obtained with ALDHlo cells (Fig. 3B). These results were
further conﬁrmed by Ki67 IHC analysis of the tumors obtained by
subcutaneous injection of ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells from both
cell lines and primary tumors (Fig. 3C). A clear increase in Ki67positive cells is evident in the tumors obtained by injection
of ALDHhi tumor cells when compared with their ALDHlo
counterpart.

To establish the self-renewal capacity of the endometrial CSCs,
tumors obtained by subcutaneous transplantation of both
ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells from the HET-02 and HET-07 primary

by FACS into ALDHhi and ALDHlo fractions, and again transplanted (103 cells) into recipient NSG mice. Supplementary Table
S2 summarizes the results relative to a total of three rounds of
serial transplantations. Clearly, whereas ALDHlo rapidly lose their

demonstrate self-renewal by retaining their ability to form subcutaneous tumors throughout the serial transplantation passages.
Next, in line with previous reports on breast CSCs showing that
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is functionally
linked to cancer stemness (19), we analyzed by RT-qPCR the
expression of several EMT genes in the ALDHhi and ALDHlo

observed between the two subpopulations with the only

IL6 Signaling in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells

exception of TWIST1 and TWIST2, upregulated in ALDHhi cells
from the HEC1A cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Overall, our cumulative in vivo data strongly suggest that
endometrial ALDHhi cancer cells from both immortalized cell
lines and primary, patient-derived tumors are enriched in
CSCs with enhanced tumor-propagating and self-renewing
capabilities.

Overall, the expression proﬁling data indicate that ALDHhi
endometrial cancer (stem) cells preferentially express the main
IL6R CD126 and signal transducer GP130, whereas the IL6 ligand
is predominantly expressed in ALDHlo cells. Hence, membranebound members of the IL6 signaling pathway, such as CD126,
offer opportunities for both the further enrichment of endometrial CSCs and their speciﬁc therapeutic targeting.

Expression of the CD126 gene, encoding for the IL6 receptor, is
increased in ALDHhi endometrial cancer cells
To identify cell surface antigens that may serve as markers of
endometrial CSCs to allow both their further enrichment by FACS
and their speciﬁc targeting, ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells from the
HEC1A cell line were sorted and total RNA extracted for proﬁling
analysis. This was conducted by a commercially available RT-PCR
array encompassing 84 genes whose functions are relevant to the
cell surface (see Materials and Methods).
The analysis revealed that the CD72, CD79b, IL1R2 (interleukin
1 receptor 2), KLRC1 (Killer ligand receptor 1), TNFRSF8 (TNF
receptor soluble factor 8), and IL6R (interleukin 6 receptor; also
known as CD126) genes were upregulated in ALDHhi cells when
compared with their expression in ALDHlo cells. Vice versa, genes
upregulated in ALDHlo cells when compared with their expression
in ALDHhi included CD2, CD3g, CD4, IL2R, S100A8, and
TNFRSF4 (TNF receptor soluble factor 4; Fig. 4A).
Previously, it was shown that increased IL6 levels are associated with poor prognosis among patients with endometrial
cancer (7, 10, 11). From this perspective, the observed
increased expression of the gene encoding the IL6Ra (IL6R or
CD126) in ALDHhi cells is of interest as CD126 may represent
both a candidate cell surface marker for the enrichment of
endometrial CSCs and a therapeutic target in view of the readily
available antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. We then
set to validate the above results by RT-qPCR analysis of the
IL6R/CD126 gene and extended our expression analysis to the
IL6 gene, encoding for the IL6 ligand, and to the IL6ST (also
known as GP130) gene. The latter encodes for a signal transducer, the activation of which is dependent upon the binding of
IL6 to its receptor IL6R (20, 21).
As depicted in Fig. 4B, we conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant increase in the
expression of the CD126 gene in ALDHhi cells from both endometrial cancer cell lines (HEC1A, P < 0.05; RL95-2, P < 0.05) and
primary tumors (HET-04, P < 0.05; HET-07, P < 0.05). Moreover,
expression of the IL6ST/GP130 gene was also signiﬁcantly
increased in ALDHhi cells in the HEC1A and RL95-2 cell lines
(P < 0.05) and in the primary tumors HET-04, HET-07, and HET10 (P < 0.05). Of interest, expression of the gene encoding for the
IL6 ligand was signiﬁcantly increased in ALDHlo endometrial
cancer cells both from cell lines (HEC1A and IK; P < 0.05) and
primary cancers (HET-04, HET-07, and HET-10; P < 0.05; Fig. 4B).

ALDHhi CD126hi endometrial cancer cells have increased
spheroid- and tumor-forming capacity
To assess whether CD126 indeed represents a candidate cell
surface marker for the enrichment of endometrial CSCs, we
stained the panels of cell lines and primary tumors with Aldeﬂuor
reagents in combination with an antibody directed against membrane-bound CD126. Double positive (ALDHhi /CD126hi) cells
were always detected in secondary tumor cell lines and primary
endometrial tumors at percentages roughly reﬂecting the fraction
of ALDHhi cells (see Fig. 5A and relative legend).
Next, the four cell subpopulations (ALDHhi/CD126hi, ALDHlo/
CD126hi, ALDHhi/CD126lo, and ALDHlo/CD126lo) arising from
three cell lines and from four primary tumors were sorted by FACS
and analyzed for their proliferation rate in conventional culture
conditions and for their capacity to form self-renewing organoids in
serum-free growth conditions, as described above. In all cases,
ALDHhi/CD126hi cells had an increased growth rate even when
compared with ALDHhi cells (Fig. 5B). The same was true for the
spheroid-forming capacity of ALDHhi/CD126hi cells that was
invariably the highest, thus suggesting a further enrichment for
CSCs by combining Aldeﬂuor reagents with the antibody directed
against CD126 (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, ALDHhi/CD126hi endometrial cancer cells were also shown to have increased clonogenicity
when compared with ALDHhi/CD126lo, ALDHlo/CD126hi, and
ALDHlo/CD126lo cells (Table 1, primary patient-derived tumors).
Last, the four cell subpopulations (ALDHhi/CD126hi, ALDHlo/
CD126hi, ALDHhi/CD126lo, and ALDHlo/CD126lo) arising from
the HEC1A cancer cell line were again sorted by FACS and transplanted subcutaneously at limiting dilution (100 cells) into NSG
mice. Also in this in vivo assay, the double-positive ALDHhi/
CD126hi endometrial cancer cells invariably gave rise to a tumor
(4 of 4) with early onset when compared with ALDHhi/CD126lo (2
of 4), ALDHlo/CD126hi (1 of 4), and bulk (1 of 4) cells (Fig. 5D).
Hence, CD126 represents, next to ALDH, a valid marker for
the enrichment of endometrial CSCs both from immortalized
cell lines and primary tumors. This is of note as similar attempts
to further enrich the ALDHhi CSC population by using a wellknown CSC marker such as CD133, previously shown to be
expressed in endometrial cancer stem/progenitor cells (22), did
not result in any signiﬁcant result: as shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2, 3 of the 4 endometrial cancer cell lines here used were
CD133-negative.

IL6 Signaling in Endometrial Cancer Stem Cells

Targeting IL6 signaling inhibits growth of endometrial cancer
(stem) cells both in vitro and in vivo
As mentioned above, the observation according to which both
the main receptor (CD126) and signal transducer (GP130) of IL6
are expressed in endometrial CSCs is of interest in view of the
opportunities they provide to develop targeted therapies.
We explored the possibility of targeting the IL6 signaling
pathway both by an antibody directed against the CD126 receptor
and by small-molecule inhibitors directed against its downstream
effectors STAT3 (nifuroxazide) and JAK1 (ruxolitinib). To this
aim, HEC1A cells were stained with Aldeﬂuor reagents, sorted by
FACS, and cultured in the presence of IL6 (positive control), antiCD126 antibody, nifuroxazide (STAT3i), and ruxolitinib (JAK1i)
for 8 days. As depicted in Fig. 6A, the presence of the IL6 ligand in
the culture medium signiﬁcantly stimulated proliferation of
HEC1A ALDHhi cells but not of ALDHlo cells. In contrast, in the
presence of either the CD126 antibody or the STAT3 and JAK1
inhibitors, both ALDHhi and ALDHlo cell numbers signiﬁcantly
declined (P < 0.05).
Next, we extended and validated the observed HEC1A growth–
inhibiting effects of the CD126 antibody and of the STAT3 and
JAK1 inhibitors on the panel of 4 endometrial cancer cell lines.
Notably, whereas the inhibitory effects of both the antibody and
the small-molecule inhibitors were conﬁrmed for the ALDHhi
fractions of the HEC1B, RL95-2, and IK cell lines, ALDHlo cell
numbers were affected only in the HEC1A and B cell lines (Fig. 6A
and B). This apparent inconsistency of the results is likely due to
the very large percentage of ALDH-positive cells in the HEC1 cell
lines and the possible contaminating presence of ALDH-expressing cells in the ALDHlo fraction.
Similar results were obtained when the ALDHhi and ALDHlo
subpopulations of the endometrial cancer cell lines were
cultured in Matrigel in stem cell (serum-free) medium: a
signiﬁcant reduction in the organoid-forming capacity was
observed in the ALDHhi fraction and in the bulk paternal cell
lines (Fig. 6C).
To conﬁrm that targeting of IL6/JAK1/STAT3 signaling affects
endometrial CSCs not only in cultured cells but also in an in vivo
therapeutic setting, HEC1A-bulk, -ALDHhi, and -ALDHlo cells
were sorted by FACS and subcutaneously transplanted into NSG
mice. Tumors were then allowed to reach an average size of about
80 to 100 mm3. From this time point on (. 24 days after
transplantation), tumor-bearing animals were administered
intraperitoneally with either the STAT3 or JAK1 inhibitor three
times a week for a total of 3 weeks. As shown in Fig. 6D and E, the
size of tumors derived from ALDHhi and bulk cells was signiﬁcantly reduced by both small-molecule inhibitors. In contrast,

tumors derived from ALDHlo cells were not affected by the 2
speciﬁc STAT3 and JAK1 inhibitors. In the latter case, ALDHlo
-derived tumors even appeared to be increased in size, although
the differences with the control (PBS) group never reached statistical signiﬁcance.
ALDHhi endometrial cells are resistant to cisplatin and sensitive
to combination of cisplatin and IL6 signaling inhibitors
Finally, we tested the chemoresistance of endometrial ALDHhi
cells and assayed the therapeutic potential of a combinatorial
treatment comprising a conventional cytotoxic drug as cisplatin
together with the above antibody or small-molecule inhibitors
targeting the IL6 pathway.
To this aim, we chose the HEC1A line because of its well-known
resistance to cisplatin (23), sorted it into ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells
by FACS, and cultured them in the presence of control medium
and of cisplatin (50 and 100 mmol/L). Notably, ALDHhi cells show
a striking resistance against cisplatin, whereas ALDHlo cells demonstrated high sensitivity to the same drug (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Next, we tested bulk HEC1A cells for their capacity to grow
in the presence of the various the JAK1/STAT3 inhibitors and
CD126 antibody as single agents and in comparison with cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. S3B). This allowed us to establish a
baseline to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of the combinatorial
treatments. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3C, HEC1A cells
grown in the presence of combinations of cisplatin with either the
CD126 antibody or the STAT3 and JAK1 inhibitors for 3.5 days
and then cultured in control medium for 3 weeks were severely
affected and were unable to regrow. A very different result was
obtained with cisplatin alone (50 and 100 mmol/L) where, in
agreement with the observations shown in Supplementary Fig.
S3A, substantial regrowth was observed.

Discussion
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the industrialized world and is generally characterized by
a favorable outcome due to the early presentation of diseaserelated symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding. At that time
point, endometrial cancer is often conﬁned to the endometrium
without myometrial invasion and lymph node metastasis and can
be treated by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
with or without adjuvant treatment with a 5-year survival rate of
86% (24). However, survival is poor in patients with recurrent or
metastatic endometrial cancer (5-year survival rate, 15%; ref. 12).
These patients additionally receive platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin and doxorubicin or carboplatin and paclitaxel).

van der Zee et al.

As for the majority of solid malignancies, endometrial cancer
encompasses CSCs capable of self-renewal and differentiation
(25). Endometrial CSCs have been prospectively enriched both as
side population cells (26) and by the use of markers known to be
associated with CSCs in other tumor types (25). Additional and
more general methods, for example, the increased activity of
detoxifying enzymes such as ALDH in stem cells, have been
successfully applied to enrich CSCs in a broad spectrum of
malignancies, including colon, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer (3–5, 27). Our results indicate that ALDHhi/CD126þ cells
from endometrial cancer cell lines and PDX are enriched in CSCs.
Notably, we could not ﬁnd any correlation between expression of
CD133 and the ALDHhi subpopulation enriched in CSCs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The CD133-positive nature of IK cells was in
agreement with previous observations (28).
We show that the ALDHhi CSCs are characterized by enhanced
proliferation, which opens the possibility that other, possibly
more quiescent CSC species are present within endometrial
malignancies as previously observed for other tumor types (29).
To sort and quantify ALDHhi and ALDHlo cells from endometrial cancer cell lines and PDX, we have here preferred the
enzymatic Aldeﬂuor assay to ALDH1 IHC. The main advantage
of Aldeﬂuor resides in its functional nature able to detect ALDH
activity from several aldehyde dehydrogenases whether IHC is
mainly based on the protein encoded by the main gene ALDH1.
The CSC-0ALDH connection is likely to be of clinical relevance,
as increased ALDH1 gene expression was found to negatively
correlate with overall survival in endometrial cancer (6). This was
here conﬁrmed by the inverse correlation found between ALDH
levels and tumor differentiation with low-grade, well-differentiated tumors characterized by lower ALDH activity when compared with high-grade lesions (Fig. 1). Although the use of speciﬁc
PR isoforms (rather than pan-antibodies) as differentiation markers in endometrial cancer has been debated in the literature (17,
18), it is generally accepted that an overall decreased PR/ER
expression characterizes most poorly differentiated lesions.
The cellular activity and the relative size of the CSC subpopulation within a tumor are regulated, among others, by inﬂammatory signals from the microenvironment (30). In endometrial
cancer, high expression levels of the inﬂammatory cytokine IL6
and of its downstream effector STAT3 are often found in therapyinsensitive endometrial cancers where they represent poor prognosis indicators (11, 20). Notably, several studies implicate both
IL6 and STAT3 as important regulators of self-renewal of CSCs in a
broad spectrum of tumor types (31–36). IL6 represents the link
between inﬂammation and malignant transformation, as it activates the NF-kB pathway that, on its turn, promotes IL6 expression
in a positive feedback loop (37). Finally, activation of the IL6
signaling cascade results in the de novo generation of CSCs through
induction of EMT (38). The latter is also in agreement with our
previous study, where increased expression levels of IL6 and
STAT3 were detected in endometrial tumors displaying EMT
features (39). Our RT-qPCR analysis of several EMT-related genes
in endometrial cancer cell lines identiﬁed differential expression
between the ALDHhi and ALDHlo subpopulations of the HEC1A
cell line only in the case of TWIST1 and TWIST2 (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Notably, a previous study failed to ﬁnd any correlation
between the expression of EMT and CSCs markers on a large
cohort of primary endometrial cancers (40).
Hence, targeting the IL6 pathway in endometrial cancer
holds therapeutic potential especially in view of the availability

3620 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

of IL6 blocking antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab; refs. 41, 42) and
STAT3 inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib) that interfere with the
upstream JAK2 (43). Our data reinforce and extend the therapeutic potentials of small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies
targeting the IL6 pathway in endometrial cancer: we show that
expression levels of the genes encoding for the IL6R CD126 and
for its signaling transducer GP130 are signiﬁcantly elevated in
endometrial CSCs when compared with their non-CSC counterpart. Notably, the latter appears to have elevated IL6 gene
expression that, in combination with the more CSC-speciﬁc
expression of its receptor and signaling transducer, is suggestive
of a dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and their more committed equivalents in endometrial malignancies based on IL6
secretion. Previously, it was shown that IL6 secretion mediates
the dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and NSCCs (non–stem
cancer cells) in a cellular model of breast cancer (44). IL6 is
thought to maintain the relative size of these cellular subpopulations over many generations by converting NSCCs into
CSCs, although it is unclear how the expression pattern of IL6
and its receptor CD126 and signaling transducer GP130 is
distributed between the two subpopulations of breast cancer
cells. Here, we show that expression of the IL6 gene is enhanced
in more committed endometrial cancer cells, whereas CD126
and GP130 are mainly expressed in CSCs. Hence, paracrine IL6
secretion from endometrial NSCCs is likely to stimulate selfrenewal of the CSCs endowed with the IL6R and signaling
transducer. Vice versa, autocrine IL6 stimulation among endometrial NSCCs will be effective only in the minority of cells
expressing CD126 and GP130, which are likely to function as a
reservoir for de novo CSC formation.
We also show that the previously reported resistance of the
HEC1A cell line to cisplatin (23) is mainly due to the CSCenriched ALDHhi fraction (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, this
CSC subpopulation can be efﬁciently targeted when cytostatic
drugs such as cisplatin are combined with small molecules and
antibodies directed against members of the IL6 pathway expressed
by CSCs. Improved therapeutic efﬁcacy of the combinatorial
treatments was observed with a signiﬁcant increase in cell death,
thus compromising the ability of the cancer cell to regrow upon
withdrawal of the selective pressure (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Notably, similar results were obtained with RL95-2 using cisplatin
in combination with either the STAT3 inhibitor nifuroxazide or
with the anti-CD126 antibody (data not shown).
CSCs coexist within primary malignancies together with other
more committed subpopulations in a dynamic equilibrium, the
mechanisms of which are to date poorly understood (45). Our
results on the expression patterns of the IL6 ligand in NSCCs and
of its signaling receptor and transducer in endometrial CSCs
represent the ﬁrst step toward the elucidation of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic equilibrium
among functionally distinct subpopulations of cancer cells. Moreover, our data offer novel therapeutic targets for patients with
endometrial cancer with recurrent or metastatic endometrial
cancer, often showing resistance to conventional chemotherapy.
In these cases, combinatorial treatments where platinum-based
cytotoxic therapies directed at the bulk of the tumor cells (e.g.,
cisplatin and doxorubicin or carboplatin and paclitaxel) are
administered together with IL6 signaling inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) and/or STAT3 inhibitors (e.g., ruxolitinib) targeting the
CSC component of the tumor and are likely to have improved
therapeutic efﬁcacy.
