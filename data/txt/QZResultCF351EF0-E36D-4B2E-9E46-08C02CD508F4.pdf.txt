BACKGROUND: In the era of novel agents such as lenalidomide and bortezomib, risk stratification by chromosomal
abnormalities may enable a more rational selection of therapeutic approaches in patients with multiple myeloma
(MM). METHODS: The authors analyzed the prognostic value of deletion del(13q14), del(17p13), þ1q21, translocation
t(4;14), t(11;14), and t(14;16) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in a series of 92 patients with recurrent MM
who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (len/dex) at the study center. RESULTS: Patients carrying
del(13q14) or t(14;16) were found to have a shorter median time to disease progression (TTP) of 5.1 months (vs 14.4
months; P ¼ .009) and 2.0 months (vs 10.5 months; P <.001), respectively. However, no effect on TTP was observed
in patients harboring del(13q14) as an exclusive chromosomal aberration without the concomitant presence of t(4;14)
or del(17p13). The median overall survival (OS) for patients with del(17p13) or þ1q21 was 6.7 months (P ¼ .002) and
8.3 months (P < .001), respectively, whereas the median OS for patients carrying none of these abnormalities was not
reached. Multivariate analysis revealed that the effects of del(17p13) and þ1q21 on OS were independent of patient
age as well as the type and number of regimens administered before len/dex. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that the prognostic significance of t(4;14) may be ameliorated or eliminated in patients treated
with len/dex, whereas the presence of del(17p13) or þ1q21 is still associated with a dismal OS. The presence of t(11;14)
and del(13q14) as exclusive chromosomal aberrations indicates no impact on outcome. Because of its rarity in
C 2010
MM, a confirmation of the prognostic role of the t(14;16) aberration is still pending. Cancer 2011;117:2136–44. V

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal late B-cell disorder characterized by accumulated and expanded malignant
plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to variable organ damage such as osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and the production of a monoclonal protein in most of the cases.1 Although some progress has been made
in the management of patients with MM, resulting in an improvement in survival (especially in younger patients), MM
remains an incurable disease.2 The introduction of novel therapeutic agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib has improved survival.3 However, the course of the disease demonstrates heterogeneity of widely diverging survival
times ranging from months to years. For this reason, prognostic factors are needed to determine the course of the disease,
define therapeutic strategies, and predict long-term outcome.
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), specific changes in interphase cells can be detected, overcoming the problematic lack of dividing cells required for conventional cytogenetics.4 Previous studies have identified the presence of deletion
del(13q14), del(17p13), and þ1q21 as well as translocation t(4;14) and t(14;16) detected by FISH as high-risk factors for a

poor prognosis with regard to time to disease progression
(TTP) and overall survival (OS),5-8 whereas t(11;14) was
found to be associated with improved survival in some studies.4,5 Because the majority of the studies analyzed the role of
chromosomal aberrations in terms of conventional6–8 or
high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT),9,10 to our knowledge only
limited data are available concerning the role of novel agents
in patients carrying 1 of these cytogenetic alterations. In particular, some previous studies have suggested that bortezomib and lenalidomide are able to overcome the adverse
outcomes associated with t(4;14) and del(13q14), but not
the presence of del(17p13).11-13 In a recent report of the
Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome analyzing patients
with refractory and recurrent MM who were treated with
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (len/dex), these results
could not be entirely confirmed because patients in whom
t(4;14) and del(13q14) were present had lower overall
response rates (ORR) as well as a shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS compared with those who
did not harbor these abnormalities.14 In addition, an analysis
of 100 patients treated with len/dex at the time of diagnosis
revealed that this regimen was not able to overcome the poor
prognosis of chromosomal aberrations, defined by the presence of hypodiploidy, del(13q14) by metaphase cytogenetics, del(17p13), immunoglobulin IgH translocations
(t(4;14) or t(14;16)), and a high labeling index.15 On the basis of these controversial data, there is a need for additional
studies to assess the impact of treatment with len/dex in the
context of genetic alterations, because risk stratification
might have a broad implication for a refined selection and
sequence of therapy approaches.
The objective of the current study was to correlate the
presence of recurrent chromosomal aberrations (ie, del
(13q14), del(17p13) and þ1q21 as well as t(4;14), t(11;14)
and t(14;16)) with clinical outcome in 92 patients treated
with len/dex in the study institution. We analyzed whether
genomic abnormalities confer prognostic information
regarding ORR, TTP, and OS in addition to clinical variables such as age and different treatment regimens before len/
dex. Subsequently, we investigated whether the use of
HDCT followed by ASCT is suitable to improve outcome
in selected patients after induction therapy with len/dex.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We evaluated a series of 92 consecutive patients with MM
from a single institution who were treated between May

2006 and May 2009 with len/dex and tested for cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH. Approval for this study was
obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Heidelberg. Informed consent was provided
according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Lenalidomide was administered at a dose of 25 mg
on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle in combination with
dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12,
and 17 to 20. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Twenty-seven
patients were treated with len/dex as an induction therapy,
followed by HDCT with melphalan at a dose of 200
mg/m2 followed by ASCT. In the statistical analysis,
patients were censored at the date of transplantation. Data
concerning the best response were evaluated if a patient
had completed at least 1 course of len/dex therapy. The
response to treatment was assessed according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria for complete response (CR), partial response (PR),
minimal response, stable disease, and progressive disease.16 These criteria were complemented by the criteria
of the International Myeloma Working Group for very
good PR (VGPR) and near-CR (nCR).17 Efficacy was
measured with the calculation of the ORR, which is
defined as the CR þ nCR þ VGPR þ PR rates. The
ORR was assessed as the best response achieved during
treatment with len/dex. The TTP was evaluated as the
time from the initiation of len/dex therapy to first assessment of disease progression. OS was measured from the
initiation of len/dex therapy until death from any cause,
or censorship at the last follow-up visit. Follow-up data
regarding OS were obtained until June 2009.
Cytogenetic Analyses
Density gradient centrifugation of bone marrow aspirates
over Ficoll Hypaque (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) was
performed to separate mononuclear cells by standard protocol. CD138-positive (CD138þ) plasma cells were isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting using anti-CD138
immunobeads and an auto-magnetic–activated cell sorter
separation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purity was confirmed by the CD38þ and CD138þ phenotypes in flow cytometric analysis.
Interphase FISH analysis was performed on
CD138-purified plasma cells as previously described18
using probes for chromosomes 1q21, 13q14.3, and
17p13 and for the translocations t(11;14)(q13;q32.3),
t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3), and t(14;16)(q32.3;q23). Hy-

bridization was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Kreatech, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and Vysis, Downers Grove, Ill). A total of 100
interphase nuclei per probe were evaluated using a DM
RXA epifluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Hybridization efficiency was validated on interphase nuclei obtained from the peripheral blood and bone
marrow of a healthy donor. The thresholds for gains, deletions, and translocations were set at 10%.
Statistical Analysis
Estimation of the OS distribution was performed using
the method of Kaplan and Meier. For comparisons of OS
curves, the log-rank test was used. In addition, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate
the prognostic impact in a univariate model as well as in a
multivariate model together with prognostically relevant
clinical factors.
TTP was evaluated in a competing risk analysis,
with ASCT being the competing risk. TTP was analyzed
fitting a subdistributional hazard regression model.19 This
model directly assesses the effect of a prognostic factor on
TTP in a competing risk setting and allows for the incorporation of additional covariates. The TTP distribution
was estimated using cumulative incidence rates. The prognostic value of clinical factors was assessed by their estimated hazard ratios (HR) including 95% confidence
intervals. Response rates were analyzed using the Fisher
exact test. P values were adjusted for multiple testing using
the Bonferroni-Holm correction. The result of a test was
always regarded as statistically significant when the corre-

RESULTS
Patient Cohort
Between May 2006 and May 2009, 212 consecutive
patients with refractory or recurrent MM were treated at
the study institution with a combination of len/dex. In
this retrospective analysis, we included all 92 of the 212
patients who completed at least 1 cycle of len/dex and
were tested for cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH.
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The patient
group was comprised of 53 men and 39 women with a
median age of 65 years at the onset of therapy with len/
dex (range, 29 years-80 years). The median number of
regimens before the administration of len/dex was 2
(range, 1 regimen-10 regimens), including HDCT followed by ASCT in approximately 80% of patients. For
the entire group, the median follow-up time was 12.1
months. The median TTP was 9.9 months. During the
follow-up, 32 deaths occurred. The median survival time
had not been reached at the time of last follow-up.
Frequencies of Chromosomal Aberrations
Interphase FISH analysis of CD138-enriched plasma cells
revealed gains of chromosomes 1q21 (50%), as well as
deletions of chromosomes 13q14 (59%) and 17p13
(16%). Furthermore, the IgH translocations t(4;14),
t(11;14), and t(14;16) were observed at a frequency of

21%, 17%, and 6%, respectively. Because of the retrospective nature of the current study, cytogenetic data were
not available for all patients. Because of the small number
of purified plasma cells in some specimens, we were not
able to test the full set of probes by FISH in all patients.
The exact number of probes tested is depicted in Table 2.

Correlation of Chromosomal Aberrations
With Response Rates
The ORR (PR) for the entire group was 58.7%. The
presence of del(13q14), but not del(17p13), þ1q21,
t(4;14), t(11;14), and t(14;16), resulted in a significantly
lower response rate of 50% compared with patients who
were negative for del(13q14) (81%) (P ¼ .04) (Table 3).
For 25 patients carrying del(13q14) without t(4;14) or
del(17p13), no effect on the ORR was observed, in comparison with patients who were negative for del(13q14)
(ORR, 63.5% vs 60.9%; P ¼ not significant). Notably,
none of the patients carrying del(17p13) or t(14;16)
achieved a VGPR or CR as best response to len/dex,
although this finding was not statistically significant

because of the small number of patients with this
aberration.
Correlation of Chromosomal Aberrations
With Patient Outcome
We analyzed the prognostic impact of chromosomal aberrations on TTP and OS (Table 2). Although del(13q14)
and t(14;16) demonstrated a significant impact on TTP,
del(17p13) and þ1q21 were found to be of statistical significance for OS (Fig. 1). In detail, the median TTP for
patients with del(13q14) or t(14;16) was 5.1 months (vs
14.4 months; P ¼ .009) and 2.0 months (vs 10.5 months;
P <.001), respectively. The median OS for patients with
del(17p13) or þ1q21 was 6.7 months (P ¼ .002) and 8.3
months (P <.001), respectively, whereas the median OS
was not reached for patients without either of these abnormalities. In a multivariate analysis (Table 4), we analyzed
the statistical impact of chromosomal aberrations in combination with age, different pretreatment regimens, and
the duration of disease before len/dex therapy as well as
the use of HDCT followed by ASCT as consolidation
therapy. Translocations t(14;16) and t(11;14) were not

OS (P ¼ .049 and P ¼ .025, respectively). When
del(13q14) was analyzed as an exclusive chromosomal aberration without the presence of t(4;14) or del(17p13), no
effect on TTP was observed compared with patients who
were negative for del(13q14).

Correlation of 11q21 and t(4;14) With Other
Chromosomal Aberrations
Because þ1q21 but not t(4;14) was identified as a prognostic factor in the statistical analysis, we analyzed
whether these chromosomal aberrations are associated
with additional chromosomal changes. As shown in Table
5, both t(4;14) and þ1q21 were positively linked with the
presence of del(13p14), whereas both aberrations demonstrated a negative correlation with the presence of
t(11;14). In addition, there was trend toward a positive
correlation between t(4;14) and þ1q21 (P ¼ .08).

included in this model because of the small number of
patients carrying 1 of these chromosomal aberrations or,
in the case of t(11;14), because no effect on TTP and OS
was observed in the univariate analysis. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that del(13q14)
was the only chromosomal alteration with a statistically
significant impact on TTP (P ¼ .042), whereas
del(17p13) and þ1q21 were of statistical significance for

Impact of HDCT Followed by ASCT
on Survival
Patients who fulfilled the following criteria were offered
HDCT followed by ASCT as consolidation therapy after
induction therapy with len/dex: 1) age 70 years, 2) TTP
>12 months after upfront ASCT, and 3) good clinical
performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group [ECOG] status 0-2). Of these 27 patients, 25
received 3 courses, 1 patient received 2 courses, and 1
patient received 4 courses of len/dex as induction therapy.
To compare the outcome of patients receiving ASCT
(ASCT group; n ¼ 21) with patients who continued on to
receive len/dex therapy until disease progression (noASCT group; n ¼ 39), we performed a landmark analysis
at 6 months after the initiation of therapy with len/dex.
Patients belonging to the ASCT group were predominantly male (76% vs 41%; P ¼ .01) and were pretreated
less frequently with bortezomib (33% vs 64%; P ¼ .03)
compared with patients in the no-ASCT group. There
was no statistically significant difference noted with regard
to the distribution of chromosomal aberrations between
the 2 groups. As shown in Figure 2, the OS at 12 months
for patients in the no-ASCT group was 56.5% compared
with 100% for patients receiving ASCT (P ¼ .006). In
addition, the multivariate analysis (Table 4) indicated
that patients receiving ASCT had a statistically significantly better OS (HR, 0.11; P ¼ .033), independent of
chromosomal abnormalities and treatment with bortezomib or thalidomide before len/dex therapy.

DISCUSSION
This retrospective study included a series of 92 patients
with recurrent MM who were analyzed for genomic aberrations and treated with len/dex in the study institution.
All interphase FISH experiments were performed on
CD138-enriched plasma cells, which were analyzed with
a comprehensive set of 6 different DNA probes specific
for the most recurrent chromosomal aberrations observed
in MM. The incidences of del(13q14) (59%), del(17p13)
(16%), and t(4;14) (21%) were within the same range as
that reported in 2 previous trials.13,14 In addition, we analyzed the impact of þ1q21, t(11;14), and t(14;16) on outcome in patients with recurrent MM who were treated
with len/dex. The ORR of 58.7% and the median TTP of
9.9 months were slightly lower when compared with the
data reported in 2 previously reported phase 3 trials comparing len/dex with dexamethasone alone.21,22 This is

most likely the result of the dose reduction of dexamethasone by 50% in the current study compared with the 2
previous phase 3 studies to prevent infections and venous
thromboembolism. As shown in a randomized trial by
ECOG,23 a higher dose of dexamethasone (40 mg on days
1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 vs 40 mg on ays 1, 8, 15, and 22) in
combination with lenalidomide (25 mg on days 1-21 in
both treatment arms) was associated with an improved
ORR of 79% versus 68% after 4 cycles of len/dex in newly
diagnosed patients with MM.
Depending on different chromosomal aberrations,
the ORR varied in the current study from 25% to 69%,
whereas significant results were noted only for patients
carrying del(13q14) or t(14;16). Both chromosomal
abnormalities demonstrated a significant impact on TTP
as well. Actually, the majority of the prognostic power of
del(13q14) was related to concomitant alterations of
t(4;14) or del(17p13), which are frequently associated
with del(13q14). In patients lacking t(4;14) and
del(17p13), del(13q14) was no longer found to be of
prognostic significance. This concurs with previously
published data in the setting of both conventional therapy
and ASCT.5,6,8 To our knowledge to date, t(14;16) as
assessed by FISH has shown to be of adverse prognosis
only if conventional chemotherapy is applied.24 For highdose therapy, a prognostic value has been demonstrated
using gene expression profiling-based assessment (spiked
maf expression).25 Despite our own similar experience in
a limited number of patients, a confirmation of the prognostic role of t(14;16) is still pending because of the rarity
of the translocation.
It is interesting to note that in the current study,
þ1q21 was identified as an independent factor predicting
OS in the context of treatment with len/dex in patients
with recurrent MM. This is in keeping with a recent study
describing amplifications of 1q and/or deletions of 1p as

Figure 2. Landmark analysis at 6 months after the initiation
of therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (len/dex) is
shown. This analysis compared patients who maintained stable disease while receiving len/dex until disease progression
(no autologous stem cell transplantation [no-ASCT] group; n
¼ 39) with patients who received high-dose chemotherapy
followed by ASCT as consolidation therapy after 3 cycles of
treatment with len/dex (ASCT group; n ¼ 21). OS indicates

predictors of poor outcome in the context of HDCT.7 In
addition, Shaughnessy et al26 investigated the gene expression profile of 532 newly diagnosed patients with MM
and identified a 70-gene subset to be an independent predictor of outcome endpoints in a multivariate analysis. It
is interesting to note that approximately 30% of genes
included in the 70-gene predictor mapped to chromosome 1, suggesting that deregulated expression of genes
on chromosome 1 is of great importance for the clinical
course of the disease in individual patients.
In agreement with previous studies, patients in
whom del(17p13) was present were found to have a
shorter OS compared with patients without this chromosomal abnormality.13,14,27 When the prognostic value of
all chromosomal abnormalities was analyzed in a multivariate model, þ1q21 and del(17p13) were found to be
associated with a dismal OS. However, the presence of 1
of these aberrations had no statistically significant impact
on ORR and TTP, suggesting that novel agents such as
lenalidomide should be administered early in the course
of disease because neither conventional chemotherapy nor
HDCT followed by ASCT have been demonstrated to
improve the ORR, PFS, and OS for patients with highrisk disease.5–8,10 In the current study, neither age nor
type and number of regimens administered before len/dex
was found to have a statistically significant impact on
TTP and OS in the multivariate analysis. This in contrast

2142

to Wang et al, who demonstrated that the ORR and TTP
were superior in thalidomide-naive versus thalidomideexposed patients before the administration of len/dex.28
In addition, it has been shown that the ORR, TTP, and
OS were significantly prolonged for patients treated with
len/dex with 1 prior therapy, compared with patients who
were pretreated with a higher number of previous regimens.29 In the current study, we did not differentiate
between exposure (eg, as part of the induction therapy)
and refractoriness (eg, maintenance with thalidomide
until disease progression) to thalidomide-containing and
bortezomib-containing regimens before len/dex, because
the numbers would be too small for statistical analysis.
Because the greatest percentage of patients in the current
study developed their first recurrence after HDCT
followed by ASCT, the majority might still be responsive to treatment with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or
bortezomib.
In the current study, the prognostic role of t(4;14)
was analyzed in the context of treatment with len/dex.
The results of the current study and 1 previous study13
indicated that t(4;14) demonstrates no statistical significance in terms of TTP and OS, suggesting that the prognostic significance of t(4;14) may be ameliorated or
eliminated in patients treated with len/dex. Because we
analyzed the role of len/dex therapy in patients with recurrent MM (80% of patients developed disease recurrence
after ASCT), we cannot exclude a negative selection of
patients presenting with t(4;14). In the context of ASCT,
the French study group demonstrated that patients with
t(4;14) and b2-microglobulin levels 4 mg/L had outcomes resembling those of patients lacking the translocation but with b2-microglobulin levels >4 mg/L.7 Because
bortezomib-containing first-line therapies were not available in the study institution before 2004, it can be speculated that some of these patients with t(4;14) and b2microglobulin levels 4 mg/L demonstrated long-lasting
remissions to bortezomib-containing first-line therapies.
Therefore, some of these good high-risk patients might
not have been included in the current study, suggesting
that the prognostic role of t(4;14) should also be analyzed
in patients with newly diagnosed MM who are treated
with len/dex.
Because of the retrospective nature of the current
study, International Staging System (ISS) data at the time
of the initiation of first chemotherapy were available for
67 patients only (73%). Therefore, we could not simply
add ISS data to the multivariate model because the number of events would be too small to obtain reliable

estimates for the entire set of covariates. Instead, we investigated only the chromosomal aberrations found to have
an independent prognostic effect and adjusted their effect
for ISS. The independent effect of del(17p13) and þ1q21
on OS was retained after accounting for ISS. For TTP,
the effect of del(13q14) was no longer found to be significant in this subgroup analysis (P ¼ .054). However, comparing the effect of del(13q14) alone (HR, 1.84) with the
effect of del(13q14) adjusted by ISS (HR, 1.89) in this
subset of patients revealed that the larger P value is a result
of the reduced sample size and, consequently, a loss of
power rather than the correction for ISS.
A subgroup of patients with recurrent MM who presented in good clinical condition with an age 70 years
and who demonstrated a response to upfront HDCT followed by ASCT (TTP, >12 months) were offered the
option to receive another HDCT and ASCT as consolidation therapy after induction with 3 cycles of len/dex at the
time of disease recurrence. In principle, patients with
recurrent MM can be offered the possibility of an autologous transplantation because the results of previous studies indicated 1) the feasibility of the procedure; 2) the
high antimyeloma activity, although generally transient,
of HDCT; and 3) that, even in a poor-risk population, up
to 25% of the patients achieving a CR remained in this
CR many years beyond ASCT.30 In the current study,
selected patients receiving ASCT after 3 cycles of induction therapy with len/dex had an excellent OS rate of
100% at 1 year. These encouraging data prompted us to
initiate a phase 3 trial in patients with recurrent MM who
were eligible for transplant (European Clinical Trials
Database [EudraCT] no. 2009-013856-61), analyzing
the role of ASCT after induction with 3 cycles of len/dex
compared with treatment with len/dex until disease
progression.
In conclusion, the results of the current study add
new findings to the prognostic value of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with recurrent MM who
are treated with len/dex. These data are limited by the retrospective nature of this analysis and the low frequency of
some analyzed chromosomal aberrations, indicating that
there is a need for further evaluation in larger patient
cohorts, ideally implemented in prospective studies.
Increasing evidence suggests that the impact of prognostic
factors, notably t(4;14), t(14;16), and del(17p13), depend
on the treatment schedule, especially in terms of the additional use of bortezomib or lenalidomide. For example,
t(4;14) has been associated with more aggressive disease at
baseline. In a series of patients treated with conventional

Cancer

chemotherapy or HDCT, this translocation was found to
indicate those patients with adverse effects on survival.6,8
In keeping with the findings of recent reports, the results
of the current study emphasize that the prognostic significance of t(4;14) may be ameliorated or eliminated in
patients treated with lenalidomide-based or bortezomibbased combinations.12,13,31 Hence, we support the concept of the early use of novel agents such as lenalidomide
and bortezomib in MM patients with high-risk disease.32
