BACKGROUND. The purpose was to evaluate the prognostic factors and treatment
outcome of Indian patients with primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
of the tonsil treated at a single institution.

METHODS. In all, 121 patients with DLBCL of the tonsil, treated at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, from January 1990 to December 2002, were
included. The median age was 45 years and the majority of patients (68%) were
males. Systemic symptoms were present in 12% of patients; 28% presented with
stage I and 67% had stage II disease. Treatment consisted of a combination of
chemotherapy (CTh) and radiotherapy (RT) for the majority of patients (69.4%).
Among those receiving RT, 64% received an RT dose of 45 Gy.

RESULTS. After a median follow-up of 62 months, disease-free survival (DFS) and

overall survival (OS) were 66.4% and 81.6%, respectively. Significant prognostic
factors included: WHO performance score 2 (OS: 72.1% vs 95.6%, P 5 .016),
bulky tumors (OS: 68.5% vs 86.9%, P 5 .001), presence of B-symptoms (OS: 36.7%

15.12), and B symptoms (HR, 6.27; 95% CI, 2.38–16.48), retained statistical significance. CTh 1 RT resulted in a significantly better outcome than those treated
with CTh alone (OS: 85.7% vs 70.7%, P 5 .008). The complete response (P 5 .053),
DFS (P 5 .039), and OS (P 5 .014) rates were significantly better for patients
receiving an RT dose 45 Gy.
CONCLUSIONS. Tumor bulk, WHO performance score, the presence of B symptoms, and Ann Arbor stage significantly influence outcome. A combined modality
treatment, consisting of CTh and RT (with an RT dose of 45 Gy), results in a
satisfactory outcome in patients with this uncommon neoplasm. Cancer

alignant lymphoma is primarily a disorder of the lymph nodes;
however, 24% to 48% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL)
may arise from extranodal sites, and there appears to be an increasing incidence of such lymphomas during the past few decades.1
Approximately 10% of patients with NHL present with extranodal disease in the head and neck region.2 Furthermore, more than half of
these head and neck lymphomas occur in the Waldeyer ring,2,3 and
40% to 50% of these arise from the tonsil.4,5 These lymphomas occur
predominantly in elderly males and present as a tonsillar swelling,
cervical adenopathy, dysphagia, odynophagia, or with a sore throat.
The majority of tonsil lymphomas are of B-cell origin and the most
common histological type is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL).6,7 Most patients present with localized disease: stage I in

12% to 42%, stage II in 36% to 60%, and stage III or
IV disease in 10% to 20% or less.6–9 Treatment
approaches that have been used include radiotherapy
(RT) alone, chemotherapy (CTh) alone, or a combination of both (CTh 1 RT).5,10 Most series in the literature have reported results of treating lymphomas
of the Waldeyer ring as a group and the resultant diversity of primary site, histology, presentation, therapeutic modality, and outcome makes it difficult to
draw meaningful conclusions from these studies. In
an attempt to further define the prognostic factors,
appropriate management, and treatment outcome for
patients with primary DLBCL of the tonsil, we reviewed our experience with this particular extranodal
lymphoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
One hundred and twenty-one patients with DLBCL
of the tonsil were treated at the Tata Memorial Hospital from January 1990 to December 2002. All
patients were of Indian origin. The age at presentation ranged from 11 to 74 years with a median age of
45 years. There were 82 males and 39 females (maleto-female ratio 2.1:1). The majority of patients (57%)
presented with cervical lymphadenopathy. The other
common presenting symptoms were growth or ulcer
on the tonsil (38%), dysphagia or foreign-body sensation (36%), odynophagia or otalgia (20%), change in
voice (5.8%), and presentation with only ‘B’ symptoms (1.6%). Thirty-three (27%) patients had lesions
that were clinically or radiologically determined to
be over 7 cm in size (bulky tumors). Pathologic specimens of all patients were evaluated by experienced
pathologists at our institute and classified according
to the REAL classification system.11 All patients
included in this study were diagnosed on the basis of
histopathology and immunohistochemistry to have
DLBCL. The patients were clinically staged according
to the Ann Arbor system. Staging investigations
included complete blood cell counts, serum biochemistry, bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, chest x-ray, ultrasonography of the abdomen
and pelvis, or computed tomography (CT) scan of
the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, and CT scan of the
head and neck region. Thirty-four (28%) patients had
stage I disease, 81 (67%) had stage II disease,
whereas 6 (5%) had stage III/IV disease (stage III, 4;
stage IV, 2). Systemic symptoms (B-symptoms) were
present in only 15 (12%) patients, consisting of fever
(80%), weight loss (60%), and night sweats (15%).
Eighty-four (69.4%) patients were treated with a
combination of CTh and RT, whereas the remaining
37 (30.6%) received CTh alone. The distribution of

treatment choice by stage is shown in Table 1. The
various CTh regimens used were CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/M2, doxorubicin 50 mg/M2, vincristine 1.4 mg/M2, and prednisolone 100 mg) in 65.3%
(n 5 79), COP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/M2, vincristine 1.4 mg/M2, and prednisolone 40 mg) in
24.8% (n 5 30), MACOP-B (methotrexate 400 mg/M2,
doxorubicin 50 mg/M2, cyclophosphamide 350 mg/
M2, vincristine 1.4 mg/M2, prednisolone 75 mg, and
bleomycin 10 U/M2) in 8.3% (n 5 10), and other
CTh regimens in 1.6% (n 5 2) patients. The financial
status of the patient influenced the choice of chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was
delivered using 60 cobalt c-rays or 6MV photons
using conventional bilateral parallel opposed portals.
The portals included the entire Waldeyer ring and
the lymphatic drainage areas (bilateral level Ib to
level V neck nodes). The EBRT dose ranged from 30
to 54 Gy with a median dose of 45 Gy. Despite the
wide dose range, the use of 2 fractionation schedules
predominated; 56% (n 5 47) of the 84 patients treated with CTh 1 RT received an EBRT dose of 45 Gy
in 25 fractions, whereas 29% (n 5 24) were irradiated
to a dose of 40 Gy in 20 fractions.

Statistical Analysis
Follow-up information was abstracted from patients’
hospital records and from an existing database of
patients attending the Joint Lymphoma Clinic. Consecutive patients with involvement of the tonsils
were considered for this retrospective study based on
the following selection criteria: 1) primary symptoms
and majority of the tumor bulky localized in 1 or
both tonsils; 2) histopathologic examination and
immunohistochemistry confirming the diagnosis of
DLBCL type of NHL. Complete response (CR) rates,
disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)
were the endpoints reviewed in this study. The definitions of CR, partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), and progressive disease (PD) provided by the
WHO criteria for reporting results12 were used. The
chi-square (v2) test was used to compare CR rates.
OS was calculated from date of registration to the

date of death due to any cause. Univariate analysis
for DFS and OS rates were done using the KaplanMeier method and prognostic factors were compared
using the log-rank test. Multiple-covariate analysis
was performed using the stepwise Cox proportional
hazards regression model. The hazard ratio (HR)
with the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated
for the treatment groups.

RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 62 months (range, 2–176
months) for surviving patients, 86 patients were alive
and without disease, 17 were alive with disease, 14
patients had died due to disease, 2 patients had died
as a result of chemotherapy-related febrile neutropenia, 1 elderly gentleman had succumbed to a second
cancer (squamous carcinoma of the base tongue) 6
years after radiotherapy, and 1 young man had died
in a traffic accident. The complete response rate to
therapy was 81.8%. The 10-year DFS and OS were
66.4% and 81.6%, respectively (Fig. 1).

Prognostic Factors
Various prognostic factors were analyzed to establish
their influence on response rates and the survival of
patients with DLBCL of the tonsil. On univariate
analysis, patients with lesions that were clinically or
radiologically determined to be over 7 cm in size
(bulky) had a significantly poorer outcome as compared with those with smaller (nonbulky) tumors.
The CR, DFS, and OS rates for these 2 groups were
66.7% vs 87.5% (P 5 .015), 50.6% vs 72.7% (P 5 .003),
and 68.5% vs 86.9% (P 5 .013), respectively. Male
patients had better CR rates as compared with
females (86.6% vs 71.8%, P 5 .045); however, this did

not translate into any difference in DFS or OS (Table 2). Other patient-related factors that had a statistically significant influence on survival were:
WHO performance score 2 (OS: 72.1% vs 95.6%,
P 5 .016), presence of B-symptoms (OS: 36.7% vs
79.6%, P < .001), and the Ann Arbor stage (Table 2;
Fig. 2). The CR (P 5 .002), DFS (P 5 .005), and OS
(P 5 .012) rates were 97.1%, 90.7%, and 100% for
stage I; 77.8%, 59.5%, and 74% for stage II; and 50%,
0%, and 0% for stage III and IV disease, respectively.
When these factors were entered into multivariate
analysis using the stepwise logistic regression model
to determine independent prognostic variables, a
WHO performance score of 2 (HR, 4.27; 95% CI,
1.20–15.12; P 5 .024) and the presence of B symptoms (HR, 6.27; 95% CI, 2.38–16.48; P < .001) retained
statistical significance (Table 3).

Treatment Outcome
Ninety-nine of the 121 patients had a CR to treatment resulting in an overall CR rate of 81.8%. At the
time of analysis 12 (12.1%) of the patients who had
achieved CR had recurred. Eight of these patients
had failed at the site of initial disease, 3 patients
developed disseminated disease and involvement of
the bone marrow, whereas 1 patient had developed a
recurrence at a new site altogether.
The 84 (69.4%) patients who were treated with a
combination of multiagent chemotherapy and radiation therapy had a significantly better outcome than
the 37 (30.6%) patients managed with chemotherapy
alone (Fig. 3). The CR, DFS, and OS rates for these 2
treatment groups were: 91.7% vs 59.5% (P < .001),
78.4% vs 35.6% (P < .001), and 85.7% vs 70.7%
(P 5 .008), respectively. The type of therapy used

(CTh alone vs CTh 1 RT) retained statistical significance when entered in the multivariate analysis
along with other prognostic factors. The HR for death
in the chemotherapy alone group was 2.71 (95% CI,
1.02–7.19). In the subgroup of patients who received
combined modality therapy, 54 patients (64%) had
received an EBRT dose 45 Gy, whereas 30 (36%)
had received a dose <45 Gy. The CR (96.3% vs 83.3%,
P 5 .053), DFS (91% vs 59.7%, P 5 .039), and OS
(88.2% vs 78.9%, P 5 .014) rates were found to be significantly superior for those who had received a dose
45 Gy (Table 2). The hazard ratio for death in the
subgroup that received a radiotherapy dose of <45
Gy was 9.89 (95% CI, 1.88–52.02) (Table 3). On the
other hand, the chemotherapy regimen used did not
seem to significantly influence the outcome. The CR
(P 5 .096), DFS (P 5 .881), and OS (P 5 .577) rates
were 84.8%, 70%, and 85.6% for patients who
received CHOP chemotherapy vs 80%, 60.9%, and
78.6% for those who received COP vs 66.7%, 67.5%,

and 72.9% for patients who received other chemotherapy regimens, respectively (Table 2). A total of 83
of the 121 patients attained a CR to the initial CTh.
Sixty-one (73.5%) of these patients received adjuvant
RT after completion of CTh, whereas 26.5% (n 5 22)
received no further treatment. The DFS was significantly better for patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy (96.2% vs 54.4%, P < .001); however, there
was no difference in the OS (98.2% vs 95%) (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
Most of the Waldeyer ring lymphomas reported in
the literature are of B-cell origin.6,8,9,13,14 Furthermore, the vast majority of these lymphomas, ranging
from 67% to 96%, have been reported to be of high
to intermediate grade.6,15 The Sheffield Lymphoma
Group, in their 30-year experience with extranodal
lymphomas of the head and neck region, found the
most common histologic subtype to be DLBCL.16

Although T-cell and NK/T-cell lymphomas may make
up a sizeable fraction of nasopharyngeal NHL, the
most common histologic subtype to involve the tonsils is, by far, DLBCL.14–18 Ezzat et al.14 reported 84%
of their patients to have DLBCL, whereas Qin et al.18

found 64% of the tonsil lymphomas in their series to
be of the DLBCL subtype. Furthermore, a majority of
these patients (60%–70%) present with early stage
(stages I and II) disease.6,7 Gao et al.19 reported
69.6% of their patients to have localized (stage I or

II) disease, whereas in the series by Mohammadianpanah et al.17 18% of patients had stage I and 67%
had stage II disease.
From January 1990 to December 2002, 148
patients with NHL involving the tonsil were treated
at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. The vast
majority of these patients (81.7%) had the DLBCL
histologic subtype. To avoid the confounding influences of the other histologies, we only included the
121 patients with primary DLBCL of the tonsil in this
analysis.
In our current study we found a relatively
younger cohort of patients as compared with the
reported literature. The median age at presentation

was 45 years and 23% of our patients were under
30 years of age. The majority of our patients presented with early stage disease, 28% had stage I, and
67% had stage II disease.
Treatment policies for Waldeyer ring lymphomas
have included RT with or without CTh for limited
stage disease and aggressive CTh with or without RT
for advanced stage disease. Authors have reported
5-year survival rates of 60% to 80% for patients with
early stage disease.8,9 Qin et al.18 reported a 5-year
OS of 84% for stage I-II tonsil NHL, whereas Gao
et al.20 reported an OS of 65% for these patients. In a
study by Gao et al.19 larger size of the tumor, poor
performance status, presence of systemic symptoms,
and a higher Ann Arbor stage were indicative of a
poor prognosis. Other studies have also found size
and stage of disease to be poor prognostic factors.6,7,21 In our current series, WHO performance
score 2, the presence of B-symptoms, tumor bulk
[7 cm, and higher Ann Arbor stage were associated
with inferior outcome (Table 2). On multivariate
analysis, a performance score 2 and the presence
of ‘B’ symptoms retained their poor prognostic significance (Table 3). The 10-year DFS for patients
with stage I or stage II disease was 90.7% and 59.5%,
respectively.
The majority of our patients (69.4%) were treated
with a combination of CTh and RT, resulting in a
DFS and OS of 78.4% and 85.6%, respectively, which
was superior to the group receiving CTh alone (DFS:
35.6%, P < .001; OS: 70.7%, P 5 .008). Furthermore,
even patients who attained CR after chemotherapy
benefited significantly from the addition of adjuvant
RT (96.2% vs 54.4%, P < .001). Similarly, Gao et al.20

822

CANCER

August 15, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 4

also reported a significantly improved DFS (P 5 .046)
with a combined modality treatment in their series
of patients. Furthermore, Ezzat et al.14 demonstrated
a significantly better event-free survival for the combination of CTh 1 RT. In a previously reported large
randomized trial of 316 patients with stage I disease
of Waldeyer ring, patients were randomized to
receive RT alone, CTh alone, or a combination of
both. Failure-free survival (FFS) and OS at 5 years of
follow-up were significantly superior in the group
receiving combined modality therapy compared with
RT or CTh alone (FFS, 83% vs 48% vs 45%; OS, 90%
vs 56% vs 58%).5 Similar improvements in FFS and
OS have been reported by the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) with the addition of RT after
full-course CTh in limited-stage aggressive NHL.10
The subset analysis of our patients treated with a
combination of CTh and RT revealed that patients
receiving an RT dose of 45 Gy had a statistically
significant improvement in CR (P 5 .01), DFS
(P 5 .039), and OS (P 5 .014) rates over those treated
with a lower dose. Although there has been no report
to date on the most appropriate RT dose for primary
NHL of the tonsil, there are a few studies that have
suggested a benefit with the use of higher RT doses
in patients with nasal and nasopharyngeal NHL.22–24
Isobe et al.23 reported a local failure rate of 67% for
patients with nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma treated
with an RT dose of less than 50 Gy as compared with
27% (P 5 .038) for 50 Gy or more. In another study,
Koom et al.22 used a median dose of 45 Gy and
reported a local failure rate of 64% for an RT dose
less than 45 Gy vs 38% (P 5 .02) for 45 Gy or higher.
Furthermore, in a previously reported series on NHL
of the nasopharynx from our institute, we found a
significant improvement in the CR (72% vs 21%,
P 5 .00001), DFS (68% vs 23.3%, P 5 .00001), and OS
(68.3% vs 31%, P 5 .00001) rates using an RT dose of
45 Gy.24 Similarly, in this study we observed that
the escalation of RT doses to 45 Gy and above may
result in an improved locoregional control and OS
for patients with DLBCL of the tonsil.
In conclusion, we note from this relatively large
single-institution study that primary DLBCL of the
tonsil is best managed with a combination of CTh
and RT. The CTh should consist of a CHOP or
CHOP-like regimen, followed by involved field radiotherapy (IFRT) to a dose of 45 Gy with conventional fractionation. We also report that DLBCL of
the tonsil involves a larger proportion of young
patients (median age of 45 years) in the Indian subcontinent as compared with the rest of the world,
where it usually presents in the sixth decade of life.
Considering the young age and good prognosis of

these patients, the possibility of using 3D-conformal
radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy to
limit the late toxicities of treatment must be kept in
mind if radiotherapy doses are to be escalated.
