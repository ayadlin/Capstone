ABSTRACT
Proteasome inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can
synergistically induce apoptotic cell death in certain cancer cell types but their
combinatorial effect on the induction of autophagy remains unknown. Here, we
investigated the combinatorial effects of a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, and an
HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin, on the induction of apoptotic and autophagic cell death
in gastric carcinoma (GC) cells. Isobologram analysis showed that low nanomolar
concentrations of bortezomib/romidepsin could synergistically induce killing of GC
cells. The synergistic killing was due to the summative effect of caspase-dependent
intrinsic apoptosis and caspase-independent autophagy. The autophagic cell death
was dependent on the activation of MAPK family members (ERK1/2 and JNK), and
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but was independent of Epstein-Barr
virus infection. In vivo, bortezomib/romidepsin also significantly induced apoptosis
and autophagy in GC xenografts in nude mice. This is the first report demonstrating
the potent effect of combination of HDAC and proteasome inhibitors on the induction
of MAPK- and ROS-dependent autophagy in addition to caspase-dependent apoptosis
in a cancer type.

acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins and
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3-5].
Activation of these mechanisms by HDAC inhibitors can
lead to cell death through cell cycle arrest, senescence,
apoptosis and autophagy [6-8]. Proteasome inhibitors are
another emerging class of compounds for cancer treatment.
It works by inhibiting the proteasomal degradation
of ubiquitinated proteins which subsequently leads to
apoptosis through induction of stress-related mechanisms
in cancer cells [9, 10]. Recently, a couple of reports have
shown that inhibition of proteasomal degradation by
proteasome inhibitors can also induce autophagic cell
death in cancer cells. For instance, a naturally occurring
macrocyclic bisbibenzyl, Marchantin M, could noncovalently bind to the active sites of proteasome B1 and
B5 subunits, and induce autophagic cell death in prostate
cancer cells [11]. A FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor,
bortezomib, was also reported to induce autophagic cell
death in several cancer cell lines through activation of
AMP-activated protein kinase, caspase-8 or jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) [12-14].

INTRODUCTION
Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related death in the world. The mortality is
especially high in Russia, Korea and Japan. Surgery is the
only curative treatment for early stage of GC. However,
GC remains asymptomatic for a long period of time and
thus more than half of the cases are diagnosed clinically
with distant metastasis. For such metastatic cases, the
diseases are largely incurable and the 5-year survival rate
is less than 10% [1]. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil are the
most common types of chemotherapy for metastatic GC.
The only available targeted therapy is trastuzumab but
its application is limited to the human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2-positive patients [2]. There is a clear
need to explore more potential therapeutic agents for the
treatment of GC.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a
novel class of therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. The
mechanisms of actions of HDAC inhibitors include upregulation of tumour suppressor genes, post-translational

Our laboratory and others have reported that
combination of proteasome and HDAC inhibitors can
synergistically induce apoptosis of various types of
cancer cells [15-20]. However, the combinatorial effect
of proteasome and HDAC inhibitors on the induction
of autophagy in cancer cells remains unexplored. GC
cells were reported to be sensitive to both apoptotic and
autophagic cell death [21, 22]. In this study, we aim to
investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of combining
the FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with
the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor romidepsin on the
induction of apoptosis and autophagy in GC cells. Our
data showed that nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib/
romidepsin could synergistically kill GC cells through the
induction of apoptosis and autophagy. The autophagic cell
death was dependent on ROS generation and the activation
of ERK1/2 and JNK pathways but was independent of
the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Furthermore,
bortezomib/romidepsin could also significantly induce
apoptosis and autophagy and suppress the growth of GC
xenografts in nude mice. This is the first study which
demonstrates that bortezomib/romidepsin can induce
concomitant apoptotic and autophagic cell death in GC
cells and provides novel insight into the mechanism
of synergistic action between proteasome and HDAC
inhibitors on the induction of autophagy in cancer cells.

could also be observed upon treatment with combinations
of other HDAC and proteasome inhibitors (e.g. apicidin/
bortezomib or romidepsin/carfilzomib combinations)
(Supplementary Fig. 1). On the other hand, bortezomib/
romidepsin did not induce synergistic killing of the normal
human liver cell line MIHA, suggesting that the synergistic
killing was specific to cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Bortezomib/romidepsin induced apoptosis
of GC cells
We then investigated whether the synergistic
killing of GC cells by bortezomib/romidepsin was
due to apoptosis. AGS-BDneo cells were treated with
bortezomib, romidepsin or their combination for 24 and 48
hr. The treated cells were assayed for apoptosis by annexin
V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) staining. Bortezomib/
romidepsin treatment resulted in a higher percentage of
apoptotic cells, when compared with either drug alone,
in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). At 48
hr, the percentages of AV-positive populations upon
treatment with 7.5 nM bortezomib, 2.5 nM romidepsin
and bortezomib/romidepsin increased to 12%, 32%
and 68%, respectively (Fig. 2b). To further analyze
the kinetics of apoptosis, we analyzed the proteolytic
cleavage of PARP, caspase-3, -8 and -9 in AGS-BDneo
cells by western blotting and immunofluorescent staining.
Cleavage of PARP and caspases was observed at an earlier
time point (~12 hr) in the cells treated with bortezomib/
romidepsin when compared with those treated with either
drug alone (Fig. 2c & 2d). The results suggested that the
synergistic killing of GC cells was related to the induction
of apoptosis.

RESULTS
Combination of proteasome and HDAC
inhibitors (i.e. bortezomib/romidepsin)
synergistically inhibited proliferation of GC cells

The apoptosis induced by bortezomib/
romidepsin was dependent on a reactive oxygen
species (ROS)- and caspase-dependent intrinsic
pathway

We tested whether the combination of bortezomib/
romidepsin could induce synergistic killing of GC cells
in vitro. AGS-BDneo and SNU-719 cells were treated
with various combinations of bortezomib (0, 3.75, 7.5 and
15 nM) and romidepsin (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 nM)
for 48 hr. The treated cells were assayed for percentage
of cell proliferation by MTT assay. The drug combination
yielded much stronger anti-proliferative effect when
compared with either drug alone (Fig. 1a & 1d). The
synergism between bortezomib/romidepsin was further
analyzed by isobologram analysis (Fig. 1b & 1e). The
isoboles lie to the left of the additive isoboles, indicating
synergisms of bortezomib and romidepsin in their antiproliferative effects. Combination of 7.5 nM bortezomib
and 2.5 nM romidepsin induced significantly stronger
killing of GC cells when compared with either drug alone
(P<0.001; Fig. 1c & 1f). The combination indices of AGSBDneo and SNU-719 cells treated with the combination
of 7.5 nM bortezomib and 2.5 nM romidepsin are 0.134
and 0.419, respectively. The low combination indices
(both <1) further demonstrated the strong synergistic antiproliferative effects. The synergistic killing of GC cells

We have reported that the combination of HDAC
and proteasome inhibitors could induce apoptosis of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells through an ROSand caspase-dependent mechanism [19, 20]. Here, we
tested whether the synergistic killing of GC cells by
bortezomib/romidepsin was dependent on ROS generation
and caspase activation. We treated GC cells with either
NAC, an ROS scavenger, or Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase
inhibitor before treatment with bortezomib/romidepsin.
We found that both NAC and Z-VAD-FMK could
significantly reduce the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3,
-8 and -9 (Fig. 3a). Since the intrinsic apoptotic initiator
caspase-9 was activated, we also performed the JC-1 assay
to investigate whether bortezomib/romidepsin could affect
the mitochondrial membrane potential in GC cells. Our
data showed that the drug combination could effectively
reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential when

compared with either drug alone (Fig. 3b). Moreover, we
confirmed that bortezomib/romidepsin could also induce
the generation of ROS in GC cells (Fig. 3c). Collectively,
our data suggest that bortezomib/romidepsin could induce
GC cell death through an ROS- and caspase-dependent
intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

romidepsin (Fig. 4). However, cell death was largely
dependent on ROS generation because NAC significantly
reduced the percentage of dead cells (Fig. 4). Taken
together, our data indicated that a significant proportion of
cells were killed through an ROS-dependent, but caspaseindependent pathway.

Bortezomib/romidepsin also induced caspaseindependent cell death

Bortezomib/romidepsin induced autophagic
cell death

It is reported that GC is subject to both apoptotic
and autophagic cell death upon treatment with different
therapeutic agents [21, 22]. We thus also investigated
the mediation of other cell death through mechanisms in
addition to apoptosis by the combination. According to the
active caspase-3/PI assay, although caspase-3 activation
(Z-DEVD +ve cells) was detected in the majority of dead
cells (PI +ve cells), addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK could only partially reduce the percentage
of dead cells induced by bortezomib/romidepsin (Fig. 4).
Furthermore, addition of necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of
necroptosis, did not suppress the cell death by bortezomib/

To investigate whether the caspase-independent cell
death was mediated through autophagy, we examined the
expression of several proteins known to be participated
in the induction of autophagy, including LC3-I, LC3-II,
Beclin-1 and ATG-12, in GC cells treated with bortezomib/
romidepsin (Fig. 5a). The expression of LC3-I, LC3-II and
Atg-12 was up-regulated upon treatment with bortezomib/
romidepsin. The up-regulation of these proteins was
significantly counteracted by the addition of NAC but not
Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that the induction of autophagy
was ROS-dependent but not caspase-dependent. To further

The induction of autophagy by bortezomib/
romidepsin was dependent on generation of ROS
and activation of ERK1/2 and JNK pathways

confirm that bortezomib/romidepsin induced autophagy in
GC cells, we detected the expression of p62/SQSTM1, an
important marker of autophagy, in AGS-BDneo and SNU719 cells upon treatment with bortezomib/romidepsin (BR)
with or without chloroquine, an inhibitor of autophagic
flux (Fig. 5b & 5c). We found that bortezomib/romidepsin
induced the formation of p62/SQSTM1 protein aggregates
in GC cells in the absence of chloroquine. The addition of
chloroquine further increased the accumulation of the p62/
SQSTM1 protein aggregates, substantiating the induction
of autophagic machinery in GC cells. To examine the role
of autophagy in the killing of GC cells, we treated both
AGS-BDneo and SNU-719 cells with 3-MA, an inhibitor
of autophagosome formation, before treatment with
bortezomib/romidepsin and assayed for the percentage of
cell death by PI staining (Fig. 5d). Our data showed that
3-MA could reduce ~20% (similar to the percentages of
cells resistant to the treatment with Z-VAD-FMK; refer to
Fig. 4) of cell death mediated by bortezomib/romidepsin,
suggesting that the killing of GC cells was also related to
the induction of autophagy.

The induction of apoptosis and autophagy in
cancer cells are known to be regulated by several
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways,
including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2), c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38
MAPK pathways [13, 23-25]. We, therefore, analyzed
the expression kinetics of the phosphorylated forms
of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK in GC cells before
and after treatment with bortezomib/romidepsin. The
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK was increased at
around 2-4 hr post-treatment, followed by the cleavage of
PARP and LC3 at 12 hr post-treatment. Phosphorylation
of p38 was not affected by the drug combination (Fig. 6a
& 6b). To further evaluate the roles of these pathways in
the induction of autophagy and apoptosis by bortezomib/
romidepsin, we investigated the cleavage of LC3 and
caspase-3 in the GC cells following pharmacological
inhibition of the MEK (upstream regulator of ERK1/2),

JNK or p38 MAPK pathways. Our data showed that the
MEK inhibitor PD98059 and JNK inhibitor SP600125
significantly reduced the cleavage of LC3-I to LC3-II but
not the cleavage of caspase-3. However, the p38 MAPK
inhibitor SB202190 did not affect the cleavage of both
LC3 and caspase-3. As expected, phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and c-Jun, downstream signaling molecules of the
MEK and JNK pathways was also significantly reduced by
the MEK and JNK inhibitors (Fig. 6c & 6d). Consistently,
pre-treatment with PD98059 and SP600125 also reduced
the percentage of bortezomib/romidepsin-induced dead
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Addition of NAC could
significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and c-Jun, indicating that the activation of ERK1/2 and
JNK pathways was downstream of ROS generation
(Fig. 6e & 6f). Taken together, these data showed that
autophagy induction by bortezomib/romidepsin was
dependent on the generation of ROS and activation of
ERK1/2 and JNK pathways.

to those observed in the EBV-positive AGS-BDneo cells
upon treatment with bortezomib/romidepsin (refer to
Fig. 3a & 5a). As the induction of EBV lytic cycle could
lead to enhanced cell death in GC cells [31-33], we
also analyzed the expression of EBV lytic proteins and
replication of viral DNA upon treatment with bortezomib/
romidepsin and found that bortezomib could suppress
the lytic cycle induced by romidepsin in GC cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Collectively, these data indicated
that the synergistic killing of GC cells by bortezomib/
romidepsin was likely independent of EBV.

Bortezomib/romidepsin induced apoptosis
and autophagy and suppressed GC tumour
growth in vivo
We also evaluated the in vivo anti-tumour effect of
bortezomib/romidepsin on GC xenografts established in
nude mice. SNU-719 cells were inoculated subcutaneously
at the right flanks of nude mice. The mice (n=5) were
either treated with DMSO (vehicle control), 60 μg/kg
bortezomib (day1-5 per week), 375 μg/kg romidepsin
(day 1&4 per week) or their combination over 4 weeks
by intraperitoneal injection. The growth of tumours and
weight of mice were measured twice weekly during
the experimental period. When compared with either
bortezomib or romidepsin alone, administration of their
combination resulted in much stronger tumour growth
suppression but did not reduce the weight of the nude mice
(Fig. 7a & 7b). On day 22, the average tumour mass in the
control group increased to ~700 mg. The average masses
of tumours treated with either bortezomib or romidepsin
alone increased to ~500 mg and ~450 mg, respectively,
whilst those of the group treated with drug combination
reduced to ~100 mg (Fig. 7c & 7d). Furthermore,
bortezomib/romidepsin also induced expression of cleaved
PARP, cleaved caspase-3, LC3-I/II, p-c-Jun and p-ERK1/2

Induction of autophagy and apoptosis of GC by
bortezomib/romidepsin was independent of the
presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
Around 9% of GC is associated with EBV infection
[26]. The expression of EBV latent and lytic proteins
might affect the efficacy of the drug treatment [27-30].
We tested the effect of bortezomib/romidepsin on the
parental EBV-negative AGS cells to examine whether
there are any differential responses in the EBV-negative
AGS cells when compared with the EBV-positive AGSBDneo cells. We treated the AGS cells with bortezomib/
romidepsin and analyzed the expression of PARP, cleaved
caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and LC3-I/II in the cell
lysates (Supplementary Fig. 4). Our data showed that
the expression levels of both apoptotic and autophagic
markers in the EBV-negative AGS cells were very similar

The data suggest that the in vitro effect of bortezomib/
romidepsin on induction of apoptosis and autophagy could
also be achieved in vivo.

[15-20]. However, the combinatorial effect of proteasome
and HDAC inhibitors on the induction of autophagy
remains unexplored. GC cells are sensitive to both
apoptotic and autophagic cell death [21, 22]. In this
study, we demonstrated that combination of a proteasome
inhibitor, bortezomib, and a HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin,
could potently induce the killing of GC cells through a
mechanism involving the summative effect of the caspasedependent apoptosis and caspase-independent autophagy.
We analyzed the potential mechanisms of the
induction of apoptosis and autophagy by combination

DISCUSSION
Our laboratory and others have reported that
combination of proteasome and HDAC inhibitors
can synergistically induce the killing of various types
of cancer cell lines through the induction of apoptosis

of bortezomib/romidepsin in GC cells [13, 23-25]. We
found that the majority of cells were killed by an intrinsic
caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway because bortezomib/
romidpesin induced the expression of active caspase-3
and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in a
significant proportion of cells (refer to Fig. 3b & Fig. 4).
In addition to the induction of apoptosis, a population of
cells was resistant to the caspase-dependent cell death but
was killed through the induction of autophagic cell death
(refer to Fig. 4 & Fig. 5). Both apoptosis and autophagy
induced by bortezomib/romidepsin were dependent on
ROS generation since the addition of NAC significantly
reduced the generation of ROS and abrogated the cleavage
of PARP, caspases and LC3. Prior to the induction of
apoptosis and autophagy, the phosphorylated MAPKs
(p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK), the apoptotic cascades (caspase-3,
-8 and -9), and the molecules for autophagosome
formation (Beclin-1 and LC3-I/II), were up-regulated.
We further showed that the induction of autophagic cell
death was dependent on the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways
since inhibition of these two pathways by their specific
blockers significantly reduced the expression of LC3II and the percentage of dead cells. These findings are
consistent with the reported roles of ERK1/2 and JNK
pathways in the regulation of autophagic cell death in
various types of cancer cells [23, 24]. Collectively, our
data demonstrated that combination of proteasome and
HDAC inhibitors (bortezomib/romidepsin) could induce
concomitant apoptotic and autophagic cell death in GC
cells through a mechanism involving the generation of
ROS and activation of ERK1/2 and JNK pathways (refer
to Supplementary Fig. 6).
Induction of autophagy can either be a pro-survival
mechanism protecting cells against stress-induced killing
[34-36] or a cell death mechanism induced by various
anti-cancer agents [21, 22, 37-40]. Consistent with most of
the reported data in other studies, our results showed that
autophagic cell death induced by bortezomib/romidepsin
was mediated through a strong production of ROS.
We interpreted that the induction of autophagy will be
cytoprotective when a moderate level of ROS is induced
(e.g. under starvation). However, cell death mechanism
would be activated if autophagy is induced through
an acute increase of ROS in the cell. The disruption of
lysosomes in cancer cells might be a possible mechanism
of the autophagic cell death following strong production
of ROS. It has been reported that acute generation of ROS
can disrupt lysosomal membrane and lead to the leakage
of hydrolytic enzymes which eventually cause cell death
[41-43]. A recent report showed that induction of ROS
generation by an anticancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone
4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone, could prevent the
fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes and eventually
lead to induction of autophagic cell death [44]. In fact,
HDAC and proteasome inhibitors had also been reported
to disrupt the lysosomes in head and neck squamous cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines [45, 46].
The data presented in this study might provide the ground
for further in-depth investigation into the roles of ROS
generation and lysosome disruption in the regulation of
autophagic cell death.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with
several types of malignancies, including endemic Burkitt
lymphoma (BL), NPC and GC [47, 48]. In different EBVassociated malignancies, the virus expresses different
latency patterns, namely type I, II, III or Wp-restricted
latency [47, 48]. We have reported that combination of
proteasome and HDAC inhibitors could synergistically
inhibit the growth of Wp-restricted and latency III BL
cells but not latency I BL cells [30]. These findings
suggested that combination of proteasome and HDAC
inhibitors could potentially target EBV in lymphoid
cells of type III or Wp-restricted latency. However, we
had shown that EBV-specific killing was not observed
in latency II EBV-positive NPC cells by combination of
proteasome and HDAC inhibitors [19, 20]. In the present
study, we also compared the responses of the parental
EBV-negative AGS and the EBV-positive AGS-BDneo
GC cells, which exhibit EBV latency I pattern, to the
treatment of bortezomib/romidepsin. Both EBV-negative
and -positive GC cells were extremely sensitive to the
induction of apoptosis and autophagy by bortezomib/
romidepsin, indicating that the synergistic killing was not
related to the presence of EBV.
Locoregional control by radical surgical resection
is the only curative treatment for GC but more than half
of GC cases have metastatic tumours at diagnosis [1].
The prognosis of such cases is poor because current
chemotherapy has very limited effect on the disease [2].
Interestingly, we found that combination of bortezomib/
romidepsin could induce apoptosis and autophagy of GC
cells at concentrations (7.5 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively)
much lower than the target therapeutic concentrations in
patients’ plasma (3400 nM and 790 nM, respectively)
[49, 50]. We further demonstrated that bortezomib/
romidepsin could effectively induce apoptosis and
autophagy and suppress the growth of GC xenografts in
nude mice, indicating that the in vitro synergistic action of
bortezomib/romidepsin in GC cells could also be achieved
in vivo.
In summary, bortezomib/romidepsin synergistically
induced killing of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. The
synergistic killing was due to the summative effect of
caspase-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent
autophagy. The activation of ERK1/2 and JNK pathways,
as well as the generation of ROS, were involved in the cell
death mechanism. The research data support the testing
of bortezomib/romidepsin as a potential therapeutic
regimen for metastatic or recurrent GC and provide novel
insight into the mechanism of synergistic action between
proteasome and HDAC inhibitors in the induction of
autophagic cell death of cancer cells.

with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature. The fixed
cells were then stained with cleaved poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) or p62/SQSTM1 rabbit polyclonal
antibody (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA)
overnight at 4°C. Expression of proteins was visualized with
Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab’)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG
antibody (1:500; Invitrogen) under fluorescent microscope
or Carl Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Germany). Nuclei of cells were stained with 4ʹ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).

Cell lines and drug treatment
AGS and AGS-BDneo (gifts from Prof. L. HuttFletcher, Louisiana State University, USA) are EpsteinBarr virus (EBV)-negative and recombinant EBV infected
GC cell lines, respectively [51]. SNU-719 is a GC cell
line containing native EBV genomes (purchased from
the Korean Cell Line Bank) [52, 53]. To assay for cell
death, GC cells grown to 70% confluence were treated
with various combinations of bortezomib or carfilzomib
(Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) and apicidin or
romidepsin (Selleck Chemicals) for 24 or 48 hr. To inhibit
ROS generation, caspase activation and autophagosome
formation, cells were pre-treated with either 12 mM
N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
50 μM Z-VAD-FMK (Torcris Bioscience, Bristol, UK),
50 μM necrostatin-1 or 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (SigmaAldrich), respectively, for 1 hr before treatment with
bortezomib/romidepsin. The MEK inhibitor PD98059,
JNK inhibitor SP600125 and p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB202190 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA). AGS and AGS-BDneo cell lines were authenticated
with an AmpF/STR Identifiler PCR Amplication Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol in August 2011. The data were
analyzed by GeneScan and GeneMapper™ ID Software
(Applied Biosystems). The STR profiles were compared
with DSMZ database. SNU-719 cell line was authenticated
by the Korean Cell Line Bank.

Western blot analysis
GC cells were treated with drugs for 12, 24 or 48 hr.
Proteins from the cell cultures were extracted and western
blot analysis was performed as described previously [29].
Apoptotic proteins were detected with the antibodies
reported previously [28]. Histone acetylation was detected
with acetyl-histone H4 rabbit polyclonal antibodies
(1:2000; Millipore, Temecula, CA). Expression of
autophagic proteins was detected with Beclin-1, Atg12 and
LC3-I/II rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology). Expression of phosphorylated
JNK1/2 isoforms, phosphorylated c-Jun, phosphorylated
ERK1/2 and phosphorylated p38 was detected with p-JNK,
p-c-Jun, p-ERK1/2 and p-p38 rabbit polyclonal antibodies,
respectively (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology).
Expression of human α-tubulin was detected with α-tubulin
antibody (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control.

JC-1 assay

MTT assay

GC cells were treated with drugs for 48 hr. One
million cells were collected and washed once with PBS.
The cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
which was reflected by decreased JC-1 red signal, were
detected with Flow Cytometry Mitochondrial Membrane
Potential Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were
detected by flow cytometry (LSRII, BD Biosciences).
Data were analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star).

GC cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates
and treated with various combinations of either bortezomib
(0, 3.75, 7.5 and 15 nM) or carfilzomib (0, 6.25, 12.5 and
25 μM) and either romidepsin (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and
10 nM) or apicidin (0, 0.16, 0.3, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 μM) for
48 hr. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) assay was
performed and percentage of cell proliferation was
calculated as previously described [20, 28, 29].

Dichlorofluoescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay

Annexin V/propidium iodide (AV/PI) assay

DCFH-DA (Sigma-Aldrich) assay was performed to
analyze the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
level. AGS-BDneo and SNU-719 cells were treated with
bortezomib/romidepsin for 24 hr. The adherent cells were
then stained with 2 μM DCFH-DA. The change of ROS
level was measured by flow cytometry as previously
described [20].

GC cells were incubated with drugs for 24 or 48
hr. Following the incubation, both floating and adherent
cells were collected and washed once with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS). Cells were stained with FITC-AV
and PI (BD Pharmingen™, Heidelberg, Germany) and
the percentage of AV/PI-positive cells was calculated as
previously described [20, 28].

Active caspase-3 assay

GRANT SUPPORT

Nude mice experiment

This project is funded by CRCG (#104003676)
grant of KFH, CRCG (#104002845) and Epstein-Barr
virus research (# 200004525) grants of AKSC.

Female BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice were purchased
at 5-6 weeks of age from the Laboratory Animal Unit, The
University of Hong Kong. SNU-719 (1 × 107) cells were
re-suspended in 200 μl serum-free culture medium. The
cells were subcutaneously injected at the right flanks of
nude mice at 6-7 weeks of age. When the tumours became
palpable, 60 μg/kg body weight of mice of bortezomib
(day1-5 per week), 375 μg/kg romidepsin (day 1&4 per
week) or their combination dissolved in DMSO in 10 μl
was administered to the nude mice of the treatment groups
(n=5) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection for 4 weeks. Equal
volume of DMSO was administered to the nude mice
of the control group (n=5). The size and weight of the
tumours were measured as described previously [20, 28].

Statistical analysis
In vitro experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated at least 3 times. Data were analyzed for
statistical significance using One-way ANOVA Dunnett’s
Multiple Comparison Test. P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Synergism of bortezomib and
romidepsin was analyzed with isobologram analysis and
combination index (CI) calculation as described previously
[20]. In the isobologram, the curves that lie under the
additive isobole suggest synergism and vice versa [54].
The CI was calculated using the Chou and Talalay method
using Microsoft Excel software [55]. CI<1, =1 and >1
represent synergy, additive and antagonism, respectively.
All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism Version 5.0 software.
