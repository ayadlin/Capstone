Abstract
Successful treatment of solid tumors with chemotherapeutics
requires that adequate levels reach the tumor cells. Tumor
vascular normalization has been proposed to enhance drug
delivery and improve tumor response to chemotherapy.
Differently, augmenting leakage of the tumor-associated
vasculature, and as such enhance vascular abnormality, may
improve tumor response as well. In the present study, we show
that addition of low-dose tumor necrosis factor A (TNF) to
systemic injections with pegylated long circulating liposomes
augmented the tumor accumulation of these liposomes 5- to
6-fold, which strongly correlated with enhanced tumor
response. Using intravital microscopy, we could study the
liposomal distribution inside the tumor in more detail.
Especially 100 nm liposomes effectively extravasate in the
surrounding tumor tissue in the presence of TNF and this
occurred without any effect on tumor vascular density,
branching, and diameter. Next to that, we observed in living
animals that tumor cells take up the liposomes intact,
followed by intracellular degradation. To our knowledge, this
is an unprecedented observation. Taken together, TNF renders
more tumor vessels permeable, leading to a more homogeneous distribution of the liposomes throughout the tumor,
which is crucial for an optimal tumor response. We conclude
that delivery of nanoparticulate drug formulations to solid
tumor benefits from augmenting the vascular leakage through
vascular manipulation with vasoactive drugs like TNF. [Cancer

Introduction
Delivery of drugs in solid tumors is still a major problem faced
in chemotherapy and frequently responsible for failure of initially
promising agents. It is well recognized that the pathophysiology of
the tumor vasculature and stromal compartment presents an
important obstacle (1). This inadequate drug delivery leads to
poor responses and regrowth of tumors. Several studies have
shown that encapsulation of anticancer agents in pegylated long

circulating liposomes can reduce systemic toxicity while retaining
or even improving in vivo efficacy (2–4). Because of their small
size, long circulation time, and reduced interaction with serum
proteins, these liposomes tend to accumulate in tumors,
presumably due to leakage through the often-compromised tumor
vasculature (5, 6).
Recently, a combination of tumor vascular therapy with
chemotherapy gained interest. Administration of the anti–vascular
endothelial growth factor compound bevacizumab improved
tumor response and survival in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer when used in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin
(7, 8). Although anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is
thought to have its effect through inhibition of angiogenesis, the
tumor vascular normalization inflicted by bevacizumab has been
proposed as a major contribution to the observed clinical outcome
(9, 10). In addition, tumor vascular manipulation, next to
destruction or inhibition, may be a useful approach in solid tumor
chemotherapy. We propose that apposed to tumor vascular
normalization, further abnormalization, in particular vascular
leakage, as well may benefit chemotherapy (11). Indeed, administration of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF), histamine, or interleukin-2
improved local drug delivery and tumor response (12–14). An
augmented vascular permeability and disruption of the vascular
lining was the crucial observation in all these settings. With respect
to TNF, we showed in previous studies that coadministration
of liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) and TNF resulted in a drug
accumulation accompanied by pronounced tumor response in
both rat and murine tumor models (15, 16). In addition, in the
isolated limb perfusion, in which TNF is coadministered with a
chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with limbthreatening tumors, addition of TNF results in increased accumulation of drug inside the tumor accompanied by improved response
rates (14, 17). TNF is likely to augment the leakiness of the
vasculature by increasing the gaps in the endothelial lining, leading
to improved extravasation of chemotherapeutic drugs into the
tumor interstitium (18).
The goal of this present investigation was to dissect the effect of
tumor vascular manipulation by TNF on intratumoral distribution
of pegylated long circulating liposomes. For this, we used labeled
liposomes from different sizes and did intravital microscopy in
the mouse dorsal skin-fold chamber for a detailed insight in the
intratumoral localization of the administered liposomes. Here, we
show that TNF not only increases the leakiness of some tumor
vessels but also renders more vessels permeable to liposomes while
leaving the vascular function (e.g., flow) intact. Consequently, a
more homogeneous drug distribution in the tumor is reached
explaining an improved tumor response.

Materials and Methods
Agents. Recombinant murine TNF (mTNF), with a specific activity of
3  107 A/mg and endotoxin levels below 1 unit per milligram protein (19)
was kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharma GmbH & Co.). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriblastina) was
purchased from Pharmacia and pegylated long circulating liposomal
doxorubicin (Doxil/Caleyx) was purchased from Schering-Plough.
Preparation of long circulating liposomes. For the preparation of
liposomes, the following chemicals were used: partially hydrogenated egg
phosphatidyl choline (PHEPC; Lipoid GMbH), cholesterol (Sigma), and
distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG-DSPE;
ALZA Corp.) in a molar ratio of 1.85:1:0.15. Liposomes of 100 nm were
prepared by sonication as described before (20). Liposomes of 400 and 800
nm were obtained by multiple extrusions through polycarbonate membranes (Nuclepore) with corresponding pore size. Liposomes were labeled
with Gallium67 citrate (Nordian) according to Gabizon et al. (21). Pegylated
long circulating rhodamine liposomes (Rho-PEG-L) were composed of
PHEPC, cholesterol, and PEG-DSPE in a molar ratio of 1.85:1:0.15 and
labeled with 0.1 mol% of the fluorescent bilayer marker lissaminerhodamine-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (Molecular Probes). The exact
size was measured by dynamic light scattering (Malvern 4700 System)
and the amount of lipid was determined according to Bartlett (22). Doxildioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) liposomes were produced
by incubating Doxil with 0.2 mol% of the lipophilic tracer DiO-C18(3)
(Molecular Probes) during 10 min at room temperature and sonicated
for 20 s.
Animals and tumor model. Specific pathogen-free female C57BL/6
mice were purchased from Harlan-CPB, weighing f20 g, and fed a standard
laboratory diet ad libitum (Hope Farms). The B16BL6 melanoma tumor
model was used for this study. All animal studies were done in accordance
with protocols approved by the committee on Animal Research of the
Erasmus MC (Rotterdam, the Netherlands).
Treatment protocol. Experiments were started when the subcutaneous
transplanted B16BL6 tumors reached a diameter of 8 to 10 mm. For tumor
response, mice were randomized into the following four groups: saline,
mTNF, Doxil, and Doxil immediately followed by injection of mTNF. Mice
were injected five times in the tail vein with an interval of 4 days between
the injections, first dose of 4.5 mg/kg Doxil and 1.0 mg/kg for consecutive
doses. mTNF in a dose of 1 Ag/mouse, which is well tolerated in mice
without any side effects, was given for all five treatments. Tumor growth
was recorded by caliper measurement and volumes were calculated using
the formula 0.4 (A 2  B), where B represents the largest diameter and A the
diameter perpendicular to B. The tumor size is expressed as tumor size
index (i.e., the tumor volume in relation to initial tumor volume). For
biodistribution studies and determination of doxorubicin levels in serum,

mice were injected via the tail vein with 48 Amol/kg 67Ga-labeled liposomes
or 1 mg/kg Doxil in combination with saline or mTNF (1 Ag/mouse). After
sacrifice, tumor and tissues were collected, weighed, and counted in a
Beckmann 8000 gamma counter and data are expressed as percentage of
injected dose per gram tissue. Serum samples were collected by cardiac
puncture before sacrifice. A Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrometer
(excitation of 472 nm and emission of 590 nm) was used for measurement of
the samples as described previously (16, 23).
Biodistribution using the dorsal skin-fold chamber. Preparation of
the dorsal skin-fold chamber is an adaptation from previously described
procedures (24–26). Briefly, mice were anesthetized [100 AL of a 2:1:1 (v/v/v)
mixture of saline, ketamine, and xylazine] and hair was removed from the
back of the animal. After dissecting the skin, leaving the fascia, and
opposing the skin, the skin-fold of the mouse was sandwiched between two
frames, fixed with two light metal bolds and sutures. A small piece of tumor
(0.1 mm3) was transplanted in the fascia, and on both sides, the window
was closed with a 12-mm diameter microscopic cover glass of 0.13 to
0.16 mm thick. The mice were housed in an incubation room with an
ambient temperature of 32jC and a humidity of 70%. Experiments started
10 to 14 days after implantation of the dorsal skin-fold chamber. Mice were
injected via the tail vein with 4.5 mg/kg doxorubicin, 4.5 mg/kg Doxil-DiO,
or 48 Amol/kg Rho-PEG-L immediately followed by injection with saline or
mTNF (1 Ag/mouse).
Fluorescent imaging. At given time points, mice were anesthetized and
fixed to the heated microscope stage of a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal
microscope. Injection of 50 AL FITC-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA;
1 mg/mL; Sigma) allowed visualization of functional vessels. Randomly
selected tumor regions were examined with 20 (NA 0.5) long working
distance objective lens and detailed examination was done using 40 water
emersion objective lens (NA 0.8). Scans were made with a 488 argon laser
for DiO and FITC-BSA (505–550 nm band pass filter) and a 543 nm heliumneon laser for doxorubicin/Doxil and rhodamine (560–615 nm band pass
filter). Vessel morphology, such as vessel density (the area of vessels as
percentage of the total field of interest), vessel segments (the number of
vessels connected to each other at the branching point), and diameters, was
analyzed using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser 4.0 software. Images were
analyzed using Image Tool (Don Wilcox, University of Texas Health Science
Center, San Antonio, TX). The red green blue color images of 512  512
pixels were converted to grayscale in Image Tool. The fluorescence intensity
ranged form 0 to 255 and we distinguished specific staining from
background using a threshold of 45. The proportion of pixels with
fluorescence intensity above the threshold was calculated. To determine
extravasation of liposomes, a gridline overlay was applied of 64  64 pixels
using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Extravasation of liposomes was scored by
counting the number of times the gridlines intersected with intravascular or
extravascular presence of liposomes. Second, using a look-up table, the

fluorescence intensity of the representative grayscale images was converted
to a pseudo-color spectrum from 0 to 255 and transformed to a surface plot.
The heights of the peaks correspond to the fluorescence intensity.
In vitro uptake. B16BL6 melanoma cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Tumor cells were cultured on
a cover glass and grown till confluence. The cells were washed and Doxil or
doxorubicin was added at a concentration of 5 Ag/mL. The cells were placed
under a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with an
incubation chamber, which is maintained at 37jC with controlled CO2 flow.
Every 5 min, scans were made using the 543 nm laser and 560 to 615 nm
band pass filter.
Statistical analysis. Results were evaluated for statistical significance
with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical tests were
two sided and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Calculations
were done on a personal computer using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 and
SPSS version 11.0 for Windows 2000.

Results
Addition of TNF improves response to Doxil. To evaluate the
antitumor activity of Doxil in combination with low-dose mTNF,
B16BL6-bearing mice were treated with saline, mTNF, Doxil, and
Doxil in combination with mTNF (Table 1). Combination of Doxil
with mTNF resulted in a tumor growth arrest and all mice were
still in the treatment at the end of the experiment. Control and
mTNF-treated mice showed progressive disease and had to be
sacrificed between day 8 and day 12. Treatment with Doxil alone
showed some tumor response and, at the end of treatment, 33% of
the mice had a tumor size index <4.
Addition of TNF increases accumulation of liposomes in the
tumor. We speculated that the observed improved tumor response
was not due to a direct effect of mTNF on the tumor cells. First,
mTNF by itself has no effect on tumor progression. Second, the
concentration of mTNF, which can theoretically be reached in the
tumor, is too low to have a direct effect on these tumor cells (data
not shown). Therefore, we studied whether mTNF augmented
liposomal delivery in the tumor. The results show a 6.3-fold
increased accumulation of 100 nm liposomes in the tumor 12 h
after coadministration with mTNF compared with liposomes alone
(P < 0.05) and a 5.5-fold increase after 24 h (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A).
Coadministration of mTNF and 400 nm liposomes resulted in a
5.1-fold enhanced accumulation at 12 h (P < 0.05) and 9.2-fold at
24 h (P < 0.01) compared with liposomes alone. In case of 800 nm
liposomes, addition of mTNF did not cause an increased
accumulation of these liposomes (4.1 F 3.7% without mTNF;
3.8 F 0.9% with mTNF; data not shown). Accumulation of 400 and
800 nm liposomes in tumor was significantly lower compared with

www.aacrjournals.org

100 nm liposomes, even in the presence of mTNF, indicating the
beneficial properties of small liposomes. Besides localization in
tumor, liposomal distribution to other organs was investigated. In
the spleen, mTNF did not increase uptake of all three liposome
sizes. Only in heart and liver we observed a slight increase of
liposomal uptake with the addition of mTNF, which could
potentially give an increase in cardiotoxicity (data not shown).
Twelve hours after injection, 51 F 25% of the liposomes were still
present in the blood circulation, whereas free doxorubicin was
hardly measurable (2.7 F 0.9%; data not shown). Even after 72 h,
still 15 F 2% of the liposomes were measured in the circulation.
With the addition of mTNF, a lower liposomal percentage (P < 0.05)
was found in the blood circulation (25 F 18% for 12 h and 6 F 4%
for 72 h; Fig. 1B). Liposome accumulation is selectively augmented
in the tumor by the addition of mTNF and is the main cause of the
increased clearance from the circulation.
Addition of TNF improves extravasation and homogeneous
distribution of 100 nm long circulating liposomes. Ten days
after tumor implantation in the dorsal skin-fold chamber, a tumor
size of 4 to 5 mm was reached. Few supplying vessels could be
observed. Unlike the normal blood vessels around the tumor, the
newly formed vessels are not well organized. They display tortuous
structure, frequent branching, and irregular diameters (Supplementary Fig. S1). Clearly, addition of a tolerable dose of mTNF
resulted in augmented liposome accumulation in tumor. However,
it is still unclear how TNF affects the tumor vascular lining.
Moreover, insight in the intratumoral localization of the liposomes
is lacking. Therefore, we studied the effect of mTNF on intratumoral distribution of liposomes with the use of intravital
microscopy. We first investigated extravasation of Rho-PEG-L with
a size of 100 nm. We observed hardly any extravasation when only
Rho-PEG-L was administered. Interestingly, when liposomes were
found, these seemed accumulated in tumor vessels. Addition of
mTNF resulted in abundant extravasation of liposomes into the
tumor interstitium (Supplementary Fig. S2). Only in a few areas
liposomes were still present inside blood vessels. Twenty-four
hours after injection of liposomes and mTNF, 50 AL FITC-BSA was
administered i.v. to visualize functionality and permeability of
blood vessels. With the addition of mTNF, FITC-BSA extravasated
at the same spot as the liposomes, indicating that these vessels
were still leaky. At higher magnification, we observed that FITCBSA–positive vessels were quite permeable for 100 nm liposomes.
This indicates that liposomes extravasated from blood vessels that
remained functional in spite of their increased leakiness (Fig. 2A).
Surface plots of the liposomal fluorescence showed fluorescence

peaks representing intravascular liposomes. Addition of mTNF
resulted in broad areas with high-fluorescence intensity representative of massive liposome extravasation (Fig. 2B). Without mTNF,
the incidence that a liposome was found intravascular was
70 F 16% and 74 F 12% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. With the
addition of mTNF, hardly any liposomes could be found inside the
vessels anymore (2 F 2% after 12 h and 1 F 1% after 24 h; Fig. 2C).
Microvascular variables were determined by intravital microscopy when the tumors were treated. Addition of mTNF had no
effect on vessel density, number of segments, and diameter,
indicating that accumulation of liposomes was not the result of a
change in vessel number or size (Supplementary Table S3). In
summary, the addition of mTNF caused an increased extravasation
of 100 nm liposomes into the tumor interstitium in a more
homogeneous way. Less liposomes were trapped inside blood
vessels when mTNF was coadministered. These results indicate
that administration of mTNF results in an increase in the number
of leaky vessels.
Addition of TNF did not alter the intratumoral distribution
of 400 nm long circulating liposomes. It has been shown
previously that tumor vessels are permeable for transport of
macromolecules with a maximum size of 400 nm, suggesting a

cutoff size of the pores somewhere between 400 to 600 nm (27).
Strikingly, as shown above, most tumor vessels of the B16BL6
melanoma did not allow extravasation of the 100 nm liposomes,
whereas addition of mTNF clearly affected the gap size. To
investigate if mTNF has a comparable effect on intratumoral
distribution of larger liposomes, 400 nm Rho-PEG-L was injected.
Without mTNF, liposomes became mostly trapped inside blood
vessels, rendering these vessels nonfunctional as no intravascular
presence of FITC-BSA could be observed. Addition of mTNF
enhanced the extravasation of liposomes only slightly, mostly at
the periphery of the tumor (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Analysis of the fluorescence intensity showed a 2-fold increase of
intratumoral localization of liposomes due to the addition of mTNF
(Fig. 3C). However, <10% of the liposomes were present in the
surrounding tumor tissue even when coadministered with mTNF
(Fig. 3D and E). These results indicate a diminished usefulness of
the 400 nm liposomes compared with liposomes of 100 nm for the
treatment of solid tumors, also in combination with mTNF.
Addition of TNF improves uptake of liposomal doxorubicin
but not of free doxorubicin. It is known from previous studies
that total drug accumulation of free doxorubicin in tumor tissue
is rather low compared with Doxil (15). In the present study, we

Rho-PEG-L alone, some liposomes were
seen in the surrounding tumor tissue (*)
but predominantly in the blood vessels.
In blood vessels filled with liposomes,
no green FITC-BSA fluorescence could
be seen (arrow ), indicating that these
intravascular liposomes were obstructing
the blood flow. When mTNF was added,
liposomal extravasation was observed at
sites where also FITC-BSA leaked out (*),
indicating that mTNF rendered the
vessels hyperpermeable for liposomes.
FITC-BSA was seen in the tumor vessels
(arrowhead), indicating intact functionality.
However, these blood vessels seemed
deprived of liposomes, suggesting that all

Figure 3. Addition of TNF does not render the tumor blood vessels permeable for 400 nm liposomes. Tumor distribution of systemic injection with long circulating
liposomes (Rho-PEG-L) of 400 nm in combination with saline or mTNF using intravital microscopy was studied. Twelve or 24 h later, mice were injected with FITC-BSA
to visualize functional vessels. A, in mice injected with liposomes, even with the addition of mTNF, hardly any extravasation into the surrounding tumor tissue
could be seen. Only at the rim of the tumor (dotted line ), accumulation of liposomes could be observed (*). In some vessels, liposomes were found to remain inside a
FITC-BSA permeable tumor vessel (arrowhead ). When vessels were filled with liposomes, these vessels became nonfunctional (arrow). Bar, 200 Am. B, although
more 400 nm liposomes were found in the tumor with the addition of mTNF, levels were much lower compared with 100 nm liposomes. Columns, fluorescence area

examined the intratumoral distribution of free doxorubicin and
Doxil. Doxil is labeled with DiO to distinguish between localization
of the liposome and doxorubicin, which is red fluorescent. When
free doxorubicin was administered, either with or without mTNF,
hardly any drug was detectable in the tumor and if any extravasation could be observed, it occurred at the highly vascularized
rim of the tumor (Fig. 4A). Limited, focal, and heterogeneous
extravasation of Doxil was observed especially at the tumor
periphery when injected alone. Addition of mTNF dramatically
enhanced extravasation of Doxil (Fig. 4B). Significantly more
liposomes (7.1-fold increase after 12 h, P < 0.01; 3.1-fold increase
24 h after injection, P < 0.05) were present extravascular in the
tumor tissue when mTNF was coadministered (Fig. 4C). Administration of mTNF augmented total liposomal accumulation
4.7-fold only at 12 h after injection (P < 0.01; Supplementary
Fig. S5). Although liposomes did not penetrate far into the tumor
tissue, abundant extravasation could be observed already at 12 and
24 h after injection (Fig. 4D).
Doxil is taken up intact by the tumor cell and degraded
intracellular. Insight in the intratumoral fate of liposomal
doxorubicin is limited. Doxorubicin-containing liposomes, such

www.aacrjournals.org

as Doxil, are relatively rigid and only slowly release their content
resulting in a prolonged exposure of the tumor cells to the drug.
However, this also means that low or moderate peak levels of free
drug are reached. Elucidation of the liposomal fate and release of
contents is useful for drug delivery strategies, certainly if controlled
degradation of these carriers is applied (28). Here, we observed
in vivo that after extravasation of Doxil-DiO into the interstitial
space, the liposomes were taken up as such by the tumor cells.
Thirty-six hours after injection of Doxil-DiO in combination with
mTNF, a separation of the two dyes (DiO and doxorubicin) was
observed and transport of doxorubicin to the nucleus of the tumor
cells could be detected, whereas the lipid marker remained in the
cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that, presumably, most
liposomes are taken up intact by the cells and broken down in the
cytoplasm.
In addition, in vitro uptake of doxorubicin or Doxil by tumor
cells was studied. Free doxorubicin was immediately taken up by
the cells and directly transported to the nucleus. Twenty minutes
after incubation, all cells stained positive for nuclear doxorubicin.
When B16BL6 cells were exposed to Doxil, accumulation of this
drug in the cytoplasm was observed after 15 min. A marginal

intracellular transport of doxorubicin to the nucleus was observed
in a period of 2 h (Fig. 5B and C). Uptake by cells as well as
intracellular transport of doxorubicin was not affected by mTNF
(data not shown). These results confirm our observations in vivo
and indicate that Doxil is taken up intact by the tumor cells and
remains predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas intracellular
breakdown is slow.

Discussion
Here, we show that addition of low-dose TNF to systemic
administration of pegylated long circulating liposomes facilitates
extravasation of these liposomes in solid tumor. Strikingly, this is in
particular observed when liposomes of 100 nm are used, whereas
larger liposomes (e.g., 400 and 800 nm) hardly extravasate, even in
the presence of TNF. Our data show that the permeability of the
tumor vasculature is not only very heterogeneous but also does not
allow passage of liposomes with a diameter of 400 nm or larger.
Intratumoral distribution studies reveal that administration of TNF
results in a strongly enhanced and more homogeneous distribution
of the coinjected liposomes. These results indicate that more
vessels become permeable with the administration of TNF. Next to
this, we show, and to our knowledge for the first time, by intravital
microscopy that liposomes are taken up completely by tumor cells,
followed by intracellular degradation of the liposomes on which
released doxorubicin enters the nucleus. These findings are
confirmed by in vitro experiments. These results are in contradic-

tion to the belief that the liposomes are degraded in the interstitial
space followed by uptake of the released chemotherapeutic
compound by the tumor cells (29).
In spite of promising results in vitro or even in animal studies,
chemotherapeutic agents seemed often disappointing in the
treatment of patients. The major prerequisite for a good tumor
response is an effective delivery of the systemically injected drug to
its target, the tumor cell. However, when injected in the
bloodstream, many obstacles have to be overcome (30). Some of
these impediments can be obviated with the use of pegylated long
circulating liposomes. Unlike free administered drug, their
liposomal encapsulated counterpart has limited toxicity and gives
the drug prolonged circulation half-life, thereby enhancing the
efficacy of targeted drug delivery (31, 32). Second, blood flow in a
tumor is very heterogeneous due to the abnormal vascular
organization. This irregular blood flow leads to well vascularized
parts and necrotic/hypoxic parts obstructing the homogeneous
delivery of a drug (1). Third, the drug has to leave the circulation
and cross the endothelial lining to reach its target, the tumor cell.
In general, the endothelial lining of blood vessels forms a tight,
uniform, and continuous monolayer of cells. However, the
endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels do not comply with this
phenotype and can be best described as disorganized (33, 34). They
seem to be permeable to macromolecules and particles, with
a determined cutoff of 400 nm (27, 35). The tumor-associated
vasculature has become an important target for tumor treatment
and several strategies have been reported. (a) The antiangiogenesis

Figure 4. Addition of TNF provokes extravasation of long circulating liposomes. Tumor distribution of doxorubicin and Doxil was studied using intravital microscopy.
Twelve hours after administration of doxorubicin, mice were injected with FITC-BSA to visualize functional vessels. For Doxil, the liposomal component was
labeled with a fluorescent marker DiO. B16BL6 melanoma–bearing mice were injected with doxorubicin or Doxil-DiO in combination with saline or mTNF. A, in mice
treated with doxorubicin, 12 h later, hardly any drug could be observed in the tumor tissue (dotted line , rim of the tumor) even in the presence of mTNF, although the
vessels were functional. B, when Doxil-DiO alone was administered, liposomes were observed in the vessels (arrows ) and surrounding tissue. However, when
Doxil-DiO was combined with mTNF, massive extravasation of Doxil from the blood vessels (dotted line ) into the tumor interstitium was observed (arrowheads ). C,
after calculation of the extravascular fluorescent intensity, a significant increase was found 12 h [columns , extravascular fluorescence area density (n = 5); bars , SE; #,
P < 0.01] and 24 h [columns , extravascular fluorescence area density (n = 5); bars , SE; *, P < 0.05] after injection in combination with mTNF. D, 12 and 24 h after
administration of Doxil in combination with mTNF, empty vessels (dotted line ) were observed surrounded by extravasated liposomes (arrowheads ). Bar, 200 Am.

Homogeneous Distribution of Liposomes Is Mediated by TNF

Figure 5. The complete liposome is taken up by the tumor cell and broken down in the cytoplasm. Using intravital microscopy, the cellular uptake of Doxil was
observed. A, 36 h after systemic injection of Doxil-DiO, the liposomes (yellow ) were seen in the cytoplasm of the tumor cell, whereas only doxorubicin (red ) could be
observed in the nucleus (arrow ). At higher magnification, doxorubicin (red, arrow ) was seen in the nucleus, whereas the liposome (green, arrow ) was only found
in the cytoplasm. In addition, 72 h after systemic injection, the red fluorescence of doxorubicin in the nucleus of the tumor cell and the yellow fluorescence of the
complete liposome inside the cytoplasm could still be observed. B, for better understanding of the uptake of doxorubicin in the B16BL6 melanoma cell, cells were
incubated with doxorubicin or Doxil and time lapse microscopy was done. Doxorubicin was immediately taken up by the cell and transported to the nucleus. On the other
hand, Doxil took much longer to occur in the cytoplasm. Bar, 200 Am. C, the percentage B16BL6 cells positive for doxorubicin in the cytoplasm (n) and nucleus (E)
after incubation with free doxorubicin or in the cytoplasm (5) and nucleus (4) after incubation with Doxil was calculated. Very rapidly, all cells had taken up the
doxorubicin and stained positive for nuclear doxorubicin. In case of cell incubation with Doxil, doxorubicin was observed in the cytoplasm much later compared with the
administration of free drug. Transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus also took much longer.

approach interferes with the formation of new tumor blood vessels
and normalize the existing blood vessels to improve a more effective delivery (36, 37). (b) Vascular disrupting agents inflict direct
damage to the endothelial cells that will initially lead to vascular
shutdown (38, 39). (c) Manipulation of the tumor vasculature with
vasoactive drugs, like TNF or histamine, causes a better delivery of
the coadministered chemotherapeutic drug that act on the tumor
cells (14, 40).
The main focus of our study is the use of tumor vascular
manipulation as an effective way to improve solid tumor
treatment. Previously, we showed that addition of TNF to an
isolated perfusion with melphalan or doxorubicin dramatically
improves tumor response (14, 41). Moreover, also in a systemic
setting, addition of TNF to liposomal chemotherapy improves
tumor response (15, 16). This synergy is not, or at least not solely,
due to a direct activity of TNF on the tumor cells and does not
result from a direct destruction of the tumor-associated vasculature (17). More importantly, addition of TNF, both in the perfusion
setting and in the systemic setting, augmented the accumulation of
the coadministered drug in the tumors. Other investigators showed
that TNF also enhanced tumor accumulation of liposomeencapsulated Adriamycin (42) and radiolabeled antibodies (43).
These findings led to our search for alternative agents with known
vascular permeability increasing activity, such as histamine and
interleukin-2. We have shown that these agents also enhance drug
accumulation in the tumor resulting in synergistic antitumor
activity in an isolated setting (13, 44). Apparently, this dual
approach consisting of a combination of tumor cell– and tumor
vasculature–directed therapy is an important concept for a good

tumor response. Although it is known that TNF is capable of
increasing the permeability of an endothelial lining, the effect of
TNF on tumor vessels in the tumor is largely unknown. Ruegg et al.
(45) showed that TNF in conjunction with IFN-g induced
functional down-modulation of the avh3 integrin, resulting in
detachment and anoikis of the endothelial cells. This possibly
explains why tumor vessels, in which avh3 exposure is increased,
are more responsive to TNF than endothelial cells from healthy
vessels, which are quiescent. It has also been shown that TNF in
combination with IFN-g and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
stimulates elongation and gap formation between endothelial cells,
increasing permeability of the endothelial lining (46).
In the present study, we show that low-dose TNF does indeed
augment extravasation of liposomes, wheareas the endothelial
lining is not destroyed and the vessels remain functional. Further
investigation is required to determine which type of tumor vessels
are affected by TNF and if other components of the vasculature,
like pericytes and basal membrane, play a role in this dual regimen.
In conclusion, we show that systemically administered low-dose
TNF improves drug accumulation in solid tumor by making more
vessels permeable to 100 nm liposomes. This results in a more homogeneous drug distribution within the tumor exposing more tumor
cells to the drug and causing increased antitumor efficacy.
Additionally, we show that the liposomes are taken up intact by
tumor cells and are degraded intracellular, releasing the cytotoxic
drug. Our results indicate that the dual approach, tumor vascular
manipulation, with TNF combined with chemotherapy, has strong
potential for solid tumor therapy and necessitates the further
development of clinical applicable formulations.
