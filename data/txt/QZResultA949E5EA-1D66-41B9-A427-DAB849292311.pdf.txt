ABSTRACT
The clinical management of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs)
is challenging not only due to its aggressive and invasive nature, but also limited
therapeutic options. Using gene expression profiling, our lab identified BMP2SMAD1/5/8 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for treating MPNSTs. In this
study, we explored the therapeutic impact of targeting BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway in
conjunction with RAS-MEK-ERK signaling, which is constitutively activated in MPNSTs.
Our results indicated that single agent treatment with LDN-193189, a BMP2 Type I
receptor inhibitor, did not affect the growth and survival of MPNST cells at biochemically
relevant inhibitory concentrations. However, addition of a MEK1/2 inhibitor,
selumetinib, to LDN-193189-treated cells resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth
and induction of cell death. LDN-193189 at biochemically effective concentrations
significantly inhibited motility and invasiveness of MPNST cells, and these effects
were enhanced by the addition of selumetinib. Overall, our results advocate for a
combinatorial therapeutic approach for MPNSTs that not only targets the growth and
survival via inhibition of MEK1/2, but also its malignant spread by suppressing the
activation of BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway. Importantly, these studies were conducted
in low-passage patient-derived MPNST cells, allowing for an investigation of the effects
of the proposed drug treatments in a biologically-relevant context.

rhabdomyosarcomas, leukemia, breast cancers, etc. [3];
development of which requires a complete loss of Nf1
gene function [4]. Although all these cancers present with
poor prognosis in NF1 patients, malignant peripheral nerve
sheath tumor (MPNST) is the most aggressive cancer seen
in NF1 patients with a five-year survival rate of 21% [5].
MPNSTs originate from Schwann cells associated with
the peripheral nerves, and account for 5-10% of all soft
tissue sarcomas [6]. MPNSTs may occur sporadically or in
association with the NF1 syndrome. Up to half of MPNST
cases are diagnosed in people with the NF1 disease [7],
and 41% of the remaining sporadic MPNST cases present
with sporadic mutations in the Nf1 gene [8], highlighting

INTRODUCTION
Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) syndrome is one
of the most common heritable genetic conditions of
the nervous system with a birth incidence of 1 in 3000
individuals [1]. The NF1 syndrome is characterized by
mutations in the neurofibromin I (Nf1) gene. Heterozygous
inheritance of a defective Nf1 gene leads to a wide variety
of clinical pathologies including café-au-lait macules,
axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, cognitive disorders, bone
deformities, and neurofibromas [2]. NF1 patients are also
susceptible to various forms of cancers, including glioma
of the optic pathway, gastrointestinal stromal tumors,

the role of Nf1-mediated deregulation in the biogenesis
of MPNSTs. Nf1 is a tumor suppressor gene due to its
well-characterized Ras GTPase activating protein related
domain (RAS-GRD), which negatively regulates RAS
activity by accelerating the hydrolysis of the activated
GTP-bound RAS [9]. Thereby, neurofibromin deficiency
results in activation of the wild-type Ras proto-oncogenes
that play a central role in development and maintenance
of NF1 syndrome-related tumors. The activation of
downstream effectors of Ras signaling such as MEK1/2
occurs in 91% of MPNST patient tissue samples, as
compared to 21% of benign neurofibromas [10], and
contributes to the proliferation and survival of MPNST
cell lines [11].
Although surgery is the primary treatment option
for MPNSTs, its success is limited by tumor infiltration
resulting in a high relapse rate. Due to the size and location
of MPNSTs, surgery is performed with wide margins, but
often unfortunately leaving behind cancer cells needing
additional chemotherapy [12]. Currently, there are no
chemotherapeutic regimens that effectively treat MPNSTs.
Doxorubicin and ifosfamide have traditionally been used
as the chemotherapy regimen for MPNSTs; however, a tenyear institutional review showed no correlation between
chemotherapy and patient survival [13]. Due to the failure
of conventional chemotherapy, there has been a trend
towards therapies that target the altered cellular signaling
in MPNSTs specifically the Ras-associated pathways.
However, results from the clinical evaluation of inhibitors
of the Ras pathway have been disappointing. Tipifarnib,
a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) that blocks the
prenylation step in activation of the Ras protein and its
association with the cellular membrane, failed in Phase
II clinical trials in young NF1 patients with plexiform
neurofibromas, as geranylgeranyltransferase compensated
for the inhibition of prenylation of N-RAS and K-RAS
by FTIs [14, 15]. BRAF inhibitors, such as sorafenib
exhibited significant toxicity in NF1 patients in clinical
trials [16], whereas mTOR inhibitor sirolimus did not
affect tumor burden, although it prolonged time to disease
progression by four months in plexiform neurofibroma
patients [17]. Conversely, selumetinib, an ATPindependent inhibitor of MEK1/2, has shown promising
results in clinical trials for young adults with inoperable
plexiform neurofibromas in association with the NF1
syndrome [NCT02407405] (48). Moreover, it was recently
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for the treatment of uveal melanomas, the majority
of which harbor mutations that behave similarly to BRAF
mutations and result in constitutive activation of the
MAPK pathway [18, 19]. Selumetinib has proven patient
tolerance in clinical trials of various cancers, especially
those dependent on increased MEK-ERK signaling,
however, its effect as a single drug seems to be limited
[20]. Due to the inherent genomic complexity of NF1
syndrome-associated MPNSTs, therapy with a single
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

targeted agent may not be efficacious, and therefore a
rationally designed combinatorial approach that targets
multiple disease-related survival pathways is the obvious
option for a more effective treatment and management of
these tumors. Additionally, the functions of other domains
of neurofibromin are not clear. Interestingly, various single
nonsense and missense mutations in the Nf1 gene outside
the GRD sequence can lead to NF1 disease manifestation
in patients [21]. Another study reported that induced
expression of Nf1 RAS-GRD does not rescue the lethality
associated with Nf1(-/-) mouse models [22], suggesting
that NF1 regulates vital mechanisms of development and
tumorigenesis, independently of RAS-GRD.
Currently, therapeutic options for MPNSTs or
unresectable plexiform neurofibromas do not address
the metastases of MPNSTs, which occur in over 40% of
MPNST patients [23]. Using gene expression profiling,
our lab has identified the BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signaling
pathway as an NF1-dependent regulator of motility
and invasiveness in MPNST cell lines, independent of
the RAS-MEK1/2 signaling pathway [24]. Based on
amino acid sequence homology, BMP2 belongs to the
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) family [25].
BMP2 is a secreted protein that signals via heterooligomeric complexes of serine/threonine kinase receptors,
type I and type II receptors. Specifically, BMP2 signals
through three type I receptors: BMPR-IA or ALK-3,
BMPR-IB or ALK-6, and ActR-IA or ALK-2 [26]. Upon
ligand binding, type I and type II receptors form a heterotetrameric receptor complex [27] that initiates a signaling
cascade involving SMAD family of proteins. SMAD 1, 5
and 8 are phosphorylated by the BMP receptor complex
and then associate with SMAD4 [28]. The SMAD1/5/8SMAD4 complex translocates to the nucleus and initiates
gene transcription in a tissue and developmental stagespecific fashion [27, 29]. The role of BMP2 in progression
to MPNSTs is evident by changes in its expression
levels at various stages of neurofibroma development in
clinical specimens. Our data mining of publicly available
transcriptional profiling of NF1 syndrome-related
clinical specimens demonstrated that Bmp2 expression
was significantly higher in plexiform neurofibromas and
MPNST patient samples, as compared to the benign forms
of neurofibromas [24]. Approximately 56-57% of all
NF1 patients develop plexiform neurofibromas which are
extensive, larger neurofibromas that can occur anywhere
within the body [21, 30] and can transform into the
aggressive MPNSTs. Therefore, BMP2 may represent a
promising therapeutic target for treating MPNSTs.
In this study, we present in vitro data for targeting
of the BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway in combination with
inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway as a treatment
strategy for MPNST patients. The rationale behind this
approach is to target the viability, growth, and proliferation
of MPNSTs by inhibition of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2
pathway, and inhibit motility and invasiveness of MPNSTs

via inhibition of the BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signaling. Our
results suggest that the combinatorial targeting of these
molecular alterations results in increased cell death,
decreased invasion and migration of low passage MPNST
cells, an overall reduction of the malignant potential of
MPNST cells.

secretion of BMP2 was also dependent on the status
of NF1 protein (Figure 1F). The TGF-β - SMAD1/5/8
pathway may be activated by other members of the BMP
sub-family, such as BMP4, BMP7, BMP9, etc. Based on
pathway analysis of the gene expression profiling data,
we identified BMP2 as the principal mediator of TGF-β
pathway in NF1-related MPNSTs, upon knockdown
of NF1. Other BMP family members did not exhibit
significant changes in gene expression levels upon Nf1
knockdown, whereas BMP4, the closest homolog of
BMP2, was down-regulated (data not shown). These
results validate our previous findings that upon downregulation of NF1 protein, BMP2 is up-regulated in
MPNST cells and results in activation of SMAD1/5/8
pathway. Additionally, these data corroborate gene
expression profiling of MPNST patient tissue samples by
an independent group [33] in which we found that BMP2
is up-regulated in MPNSTs as compared to other benign
forms of neurofibromas that are typically heterozygous for
Nf1 [24].

RESULTS
BMP2 is overexpressed in low and high passage
Nf1-null MPNST cell lines
Our lab has previously reported a significant
increase in Bmp2 expression levels in long-term cultures
of Nf1(-/-) MPNST cell lines, independent of the RASMEK1/2-ERK1/2 regulation [24]. Cells in culture are
constantly subjected to environmental and manipulative
stresses, which may introduce genotypic and phenotypic
variations by selection of a dominant clone. These
alterations in the cellular signaling pathways introduced
by prolonged cell culturing are well-documented in
literature [31, 32]. To circumvent the inherent bias of
the cell culture system, low passage (LP) patient-derived
MPNST cells, LP ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) and LP T265 (Nf1-/-)
cell lines were used in this study to validate the role of
BMP2 in MPNSTs. Western blotting analysis of low and
high passage (HP) MPNST (Nf1-/-) cells confirmed the
status of NF1 protein in these cell lines, and revealed
an active BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway via detection of
phospho-SMAD1/5/8, as compared to the positive control
STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells that express the neurofibromin I
protein (Figure 1A). Although all Nf1-null cell lines had
higher levels of phospho-SMAD1/5/8 than the STS26T
(Nf1+/-) cells, these levels were more pronounced in the
physiologically relevant low passage cells (Figure 1A). As
one would expect, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2
in all of the tested cell lines was also detected, indicative
of an active MEK-ERK pathway.
To determine the effects of cell passage on
the expression levels of BMP2, we first measured
the transcript levels for Bmp2 by real-time RT-PCR.
Interestingly, both LP and HP Nf1-null cells showed
significantly higher Bmp2 transcript levels as compared
to the STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells (Figure 1B). Although the
transcript levels for Bmp2 in HP cells tended to be lower
than in the LP cells, the differences were not statistically
significant. Further, the cell passage did not have an
obvious impact on the levels of secreted BMP2 protein
in the Nf1-null cell lines, which were significantly higher
than in the STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells (Figure 1C).
The change in expression of BMP2 was dependent
on the status of NF1 protein, in which down-regulation
of NF1 protein resulted in activation of SMAD1/5/8
(Figure 1D) and a two-fold increase in Bmp2 transcript
levels (Figure 1E). Analysis of conditioned media from
Nf1-knockdown and Nf1(+/-) cell lines indicated that the

Combinatorial inhibition of BMP2 and MEKERK signaling results in increased cell death of
MPNST cells
Currently, there are no FDA approved BMP2
receptor inhibitors. LDN-193189 is the most specific
BMP2 activated Type I receptor inhibitor. It has at least
a 100-fold selectivity for type I receptors (ALK2, ALK3
and ALK6) over other receptors of the TGF-β pathway
[34]. Upon binding to the Type I receptors, LDN-193189
suppresses the hetero-oligomerization of the Type I and
Type II serine/threonine kinase receptors leading to the
inhibition of phosphorylation of the SMAD1/5/8 complex
[35]. For BMP2, receptor oligomerization is the critical
step initiating SMAD1/5/8 signaling [36]. To investigate
the effect of targeting BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signaling on
the growth and survival of MPNST cells, we evaluated
the inhibition efficacy of LDN-193189 at different
concentrations. We found that treatment of ST88-14 (Nf1-/-)
cells with 0.01 μM LDN-193189 for 1 hour resulted in
nearly complete inhibition of phospho-SMAD1/5/8,
and these effects were sustainable for 48 hours (Figure
2A). Next, we determined the IC50 of LDN-193189 in
various MPNST cell lines. We found that LDN-193189
inhibited the growth of MPNST cells at concentrations
approximately 100-fold higher than the biochemically
effective concentration required for inhibition of the
BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway. While within 48 hours,
between 0.01 μM and 0.03 μM of LDN-193189 were
sufficient for inhibition of BMP2 signaling, LDN-193189
IC50 ranged from ~1.0-2.0 μM as a single agent in various
MPNST cell lines (Figure 2B). These results suggest that
the effects of higher concentrations of LDN-193189 on
the growth of MPNST cell lines are potentially off-target
effects. To enhance the effect of biochemically relevant

MPNST cell lines confirmed their Nf1-null status and shows an active BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway and MAPK pathway. Quantification of
the western blot reveals that there is at least a 1.6-fold increase in phospho-SMAD1/5/8 activity in all the Nf1(-/-) cell lines as compared to
the positive control STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells, with the highest levels reported in the low passage Nf1-null cells. The quantification values were
calculated by normalizing densitometry measurements of phospho-SMAD1/5/8 to total SMAD1/5/8 and then compared to STS26T (Nf1+/-)
cells (set as 1). B. In Nf1-null MPNST cells, the expression of Bmp2 is significantly higher irrespective of passage numbers as compared
to the STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells. RNA was extracted between passages 8-14 from LP ST88-14 (Nf1-/-), passages 155-170 for HP ST88-14
(Nf1-/-), passages 10-16 for LP T265 (Nf1-/-) cells, and passages 208-230 for HP T265 (Nf1-/-) cells. C. Analyses of BMP2 secretion by
ELISA using conditioned media from MPNST cell lines shows that BMP2 is secreted in both low and high passage Nf1-null MPNST cells.
D. Activation of BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is dependent on the presence of neurofibromin I, as both pathways
are activated via phosphorylation upon knockdown of Nf1. Based on densitometry, a ~70% knockdown of NF1 results in a 55% increase
in phospho-SMAD1/5/8 levels, and a 60% increase in the phospho-ERK1/2 levels. The relative levels of NF1, phospho-SMAD1/5/8, and
phospho-ERK1/2 were calculated by normalizing their densitometry measurements to the corresponding tubulin, total SMAD1/5/8, and
total ERK1/2, respectively. E. Results from RT-PCR show that Bmp2 expression increased two-fold upon Nf1 knockdown as compared
to the STS26T-V (Nf1+/-) cells. All cell lines used in this experiment are high passage cells. The Nf1-knockdown cells were generated at
passage 160 for the STS26T-V (Nf1+/-) cells, and were maintained in culture for subsequent 8-10 weeks. Steady-state Bmp2 mRNA levels
of ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) cells were determined between passages 175-190. F. Secreted levels of BMP2 are also dependent on the status of NF1,
where knockdown of Nf1 results in increased levels of secreted BMP2. All cell lines used in this experiment are high passage cells. The Nf1knockdown cells were generated at passage 160 from the STS26T cells, and were maintained in culture for subsequent 8-10 weeks. Paired

than the biochemically effective dose. A. Representative western blot (n=3) of titration of LDN-193189 in MPNST cells to determine
optimal dose of inhibition. LDN-193189 potently inhibits phospho-SMAD signaling at 0.003 μM with nearly complete inhibition at 0.01
μM, without any effects on the ERK signaling pathway in the ST88-14 (Nf1-/- cells) at the 1-hour time point. LDN-193189 continues to
inhibit phospho-SMAD1/5/8 at the low concentration of 0.01 μM in 48 hours, however, it requires between 0.03 and 0.1 μM for complete
inhibition of the target in 48 hours. None of the tested concentrations of LDN-193189 up to 1.0 μM had any effects on the MEK1/2-ERK1/2
signaling. The relative levels for phospho-SMAD1/5/8 and phospho-ERK1/2 were calculated by normalizing their densitometry to the
corresponding total SMAD1/5/8 and total ERK1/2, respectively. Similar concentration responses were obtained for all tested MPNST cell
lines. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations for the specified time points and whole cell lysate was fractionated on SDS-PAGE
followed by immunoblotting for indicated proteins, n=3. B. The IC50 for single agent treatments were plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale in
which x-axis (log10 scale) indicates drug concentrations and y-axis represents % of viable cells as measured by 48-hour MTT assays. In all
the tested cell lines, the IC50 for LDN-193189 was between 1.0-2.0 μM. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression analysis to generate

blot (n=3) showing that selumetinib inhibits phospho-ERK1/2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentrations between 0.03 μM to

were calculated by normalizing their densitometry to the corresponding total ERK1/2 and total SMAD1/5/8, respectively. D. The effects

concentrations of LDN-193189 on cell growth and
survival, we chose to target the MEK-ERK pathway in
combination with BMP2 signaling. MEK1/2 are critical
therapeutic targets in treatment of MPNSTs based on
their extensively documented role in progression and
maintenance of MPNSTs [37]. Moreover, preliminary
data from the Phase I study of selumetinib on plexiform
neurofibromas in NF1 patients suggested that treatment
with selumetinib resulted in a median decrease of 24%
in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas with reversible
toxicities in all patients with >1 MRI restaging (48).
Treatment of ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) with selumetinib resulted
in concentration-dependent down-regulation of phosphoERK1/2, but had no obvious effects on the levels of
phospho-SMAD1/5 (Figure 2C). Next, we determined
selumetinib IC50s of MPNST cell lines. Low passage
ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) and T265 (Nf1-/-) cells were more
sensitive to selumetinib treatment with IC50s ranging
from ~3 to 4 μM as compared to ~8 to 9 μM for their
high passage counterparts and 10 μM for the STS26T cell
lines (Figure 2D). Similar to LDN-193189, selumetinib
required a higher concentration to affect cell growth and
survival than the biochemical concentration required to
inhibit its target in 48 hours.
In order to avoid off-target effects, we tested the
impact of combination treatment with LDN-193189 and
selumetinib at biochemically relevant concentrations on
the growth and survival of MPNST cells. Addition of
selumetinib to MPNST cells treated with LDN-193189
resulted in a statistically significant decrease in viable
cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore, cell cycle analyses of
low passage cells treated with either agent alone or in
combination revealed that combination of the two agents
resulted in cooperative induction of cell death, reflected
by the sub-G1 cell populations (Figure 3B & 3C).
Interestingly, single agent treatment with either of the
agents required higher than the biochemically effective
concentration to affect cell growth, but the combined
inhibition of BMP2 and MEK1/2 at biochemically
effective concentrations led to growth inhibition and
induction of cell death. Moreover, evaluation of the
nature of the drug interaction between LDN-193189 and
selumetinib through isobologram analyses (Figure 3D)
and calculation of combination index (CI) values (Table
1) demonstrated that the dual treatment with LDN-193189
and selumetinib resulted in a strong synergic effect
(CI<1.0) on cell growth of both low passage MPNST
cell lines. Both candidate agents synergized to inhibit
cell growth in the long-term cultures of Nf1-null MPNST
cells as well as the sporadic MPNST cells (Table 1). To
elucidate the mechanism by which the combination of
LDN-193189 and selumetinib induces cell death, ST88-14
(Nf1-/-) and T265 (Nf1-/-) cells were treated with the drug
combination, and levels of PARP cleavage were measured
using western blots. The dose-dependent increase in levels
of cleaved PARP and the corresponding decrease in levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of full-length PARP suggest induction of apoptosis in
response to combination treatment (Figure 3E).

Selumetinib cooperates with LDN-193189 to
decrease cellular invasion and migration of
MPNSTs
Metastases of MPNSTs occurs in about 40% of
patients [23] with the most frequent metastatic sites
being lungs, lymph nodes, and liver [38]. BMP2 is overexpressed in many different tumor types [39], notably
carcinomas of the prostate, lung, colon, breast, and
ovary, where it is known to promote cellular motility,
invasion and metastases [40-43]. As expression of Bmp2
positively correlates with malignancy in neurofibromas
[33], increased expression of BMP2 in MPNSTs may
promote metastatic characteristics such as cell migration
and invasion. Given that BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway is
involved in cellular migration and invasion, inhibition
of these malignant characteristics by LDN-193189
in MPNST cells was expected. Treatment with LDN193189 resulted in a statistically significant decrease in
the invasive potential of MPNST cell lines (Figure 4A).
In addition, recombinant human BMP2 stimulated the
invasive activity of the MPNST cells and this effect was
abrogated by the addition of LDN-193189, validating
that the effects of LDN-193189 on cellular invasion are
specific to its inhibition of Type I BMP2 receptors. The
IC50 of LDN-193189 on cellular invasion is between
0.003-0.005 μM (Figure 4B); concentrations at which
LDN-193189 effectively inhibits the activation of BMP2SMAD1/5/8 signaling based on the western blot analyses
(Figure 2A). These results indicate that the anti-invasive
effects of LDN-193189 are specific to its competitive
inhibition of the BMP2 Type I receptor and the BMP2SMAD1/5/8 signaling cascade that plays a critical role
in the invasiveness of MPNSTs. As MEK1/2 signaling
is primarily involved in the regulation of cell viability,
growth and proliferation, we did not expect changes in the
invasive potential of the MPNST cells upon treatment with
selumetinib. However, selumetinib significantly enhanced
the anti-invasive effect of LDN-193189 in MPNST cells
(Figure 4C). These results indicate that selumetinib, in
addition to suppressing the growth of MPNSTs, may also
provide a significant benefit by inhibiting the invasiveness
of such tumors. Based on the Bliss Independence (BI)
model calculations, the combination of LDN-193189 and
selumetinib synergistically inhibited MPNST cellular
invasion at biochemically relevant concentrations. It is
important to note that the combinatorial effects of both
agents on the invasive capability of MPNST cells were
independent of its effects on cell survival and proliferation,
as concentrations of LDN-193189 and selumetinib used
in the invasion assay (Figure 4C) were at least 100-fold
lower than the concentrations that affect cellular viability
(Figure 2B & 2D).

combination with biochemically effective increasing concentrations of selumetinib. The relative levels of cleaved PARP were calculated by
normalizing their densitometry measurements to tubulin, and then compared to vehicle-treated control (set as 1).

CalcuSyn software was used to calculate the CI, according to the median-effect method of Chou-Talay. CI values less than
1, 1, and greater than 1, represent synergism, additivity, and antagonism, respectively. The combinatorial treatment has a
synergistic effect on cell growth in the STS26T-V (Nf1+/-) and STS26T-Nf1 KD cell lines. Both LP ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) and
T265 (Nf1-/-) cells exhibit a strong synergistic interaction at lower doses of selumetinib combined with LDN-193189. HP
ST88-14 (Nf1-/-), and HP T265 (Nf1-/-) trend towards additivity at lower concentrations of selumetinib, however, increasing
the dose of selumetinib increases the synergy in these cell lines. The CI values shown are averages of CI values of three
independent experiments per cell line and treatment conditions.
Next, we evaluated the anti-motility effects of
combinatorial therapy versus mono-therapy in MPNST
cells. As shown in Figure 5, treatment with biochemically
effective concentrations of LDN-193189 inhibited
migration of both low passage MPNST cell lines. Addition
of selumetinib to LDN-193189-treated cells resulted
in a statistically significant decrease in the migration of
low passage ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) cells (Figure 5A & 5C).
However, the combination treatment did not significantly
affect the migratory potential of LP T265 (Nf1-/-) cells as
compared to treatment with LDN-193189 alone (Figure
5B & 5C). The nature of the anti-migratory interaction of
LDN-193189 and selumetinib was weakly synergistic to
additive in the MPNST cells. This is because the BI model
takes into account the independent biological effects of
each drug, whereas for statistical analyses combinatorial
treatment was compared to treatment with LDN-193189
alone. Similar responses were observed by increasing the
dose of LDN-193189 by 3-30 fold in the same cell lines
(data not shown).

sufficient to drive the transformation of neurofibromas
to MPNSTs [47, 48]. As carcinogenesis is a multi-step
process, we expect changes in multiple signaling pathways
and cellular processes to govern the transformation,
development and maintenance of MPNSTs. To answer
these questions, we used gene expression profiling and
identified a druggable target, BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway
that was independent of RAS-MEK1/2 regulation in
MPNSTs [24]. Our evaluation of expression profiling data
of tissue samples from NF1 patients by an independent
group [33] showed that BMP2 is significantly upregulated in both plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs
with considerably higher levels in MPNSTs [24],
suggesting that BMP2 may be one of the key players in
the transformation of benign neurofibromas to a malignant
phenotype. In this study, analysis of BMP2 mRNA,
protein, and secretion showed that BMP2 is expressed
in Nf1-null MPNST cell lines, independent of passage
numbers, and increased expression of BMP2 is dependent
on down-regulation of NF1 in MPNST cells. Interestingly,
we noticed a much greater increase in the levels of
secreted BMP2 upon down-regulation of NF1 (Figure 1F)
than the corresponding change in Bmp2 mRNA expression
levels (Figure 1E). These differences suggest that NF1
not only regulates BMP2 transcriptionally, but it may
also affect the secretory pathway of BMP2. The absence
of NF1 in MPNSTs may lead to increased secretion of
BMP2 that promotes malignant characteristics within the
tumor microenvironment. Serum levels of BMP2 are used
as a prognostic indicator in non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs), in which increased serum levels correlate
with advanced clinical stage [49]. Based on our results,
BMP2 may potentially serve as a prognostic biomarker of

DISCUSSION
One of the major questions in development of
MPNSTs is the role of signaling pathways other than
the Ras-regulated pathways in the transformation and
maintenance of these tumors. Given that neurofibromas
affect almost all NF1 patients [44, 45] but only 8-13% of
these patients develop MPNSTs [46], the molecular events
leading from neurofibromas to MPNST formation are
unclear. Mutations in Nf1 and subsequent hyperactivation
of downstream signaling pathways of RAS-MEK1/2ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR are necessary but not

the progression to MPNSTs in NF1 patients. Our previous
work and this study have demonstrated the significance
of targeting the BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 pathway in MPNSTs,
which results in reduced malignancy-related properties
in MPNST cell lines. By combining the inhibition of
BMP2 signaling network with a MEK1/2 inhibitor, we
have established the therapeutic utility of combinatorial
treatment that results in increased cell death, decreased

migration and invasion of MPNST cells. Importantly,
this study is an applicable pre-clinical assessment of the
proposed combination treatment because all experiments
were conducted in very low passage patient-derived
MPNST cells that are more relevant to the original tumors’
characteristics.
We found increased BMP2 expression and
its promotion of malignancy-related characteristics

MPNST cells. A. Graphical representation of the quantified fluorescence of the cells that invaded through the extracellular matrix (ECM),

normalized to invasive activity without any chemoattractant and the vehicle control. LDN-193189 inhibits cellular invasion as compared to
the vehicle treated control in LP and HP Nf1(-/-) MPNST cells. Addition of 200 ng/mL of BMP2 promotes invasion in these cells (**P<0.01),
which is blocked by the addition of LDN-193189 in all the tested MPNST cells. Cells were stained with CyQuant/GR dye and the number
of invaded cells was quantified by a fluorescence plate reader. B. The IC50 graph shows the optimal dose of LDN-193189 needed for half
maximal inhibition of invasiveness in MPNSTs. C. Bar graph of the quantified fluorescence of the cells that invaded through the ECM
upon treatment with single agents and in combination. The invasive ability of MPNST cells is greatly reduced by LDN-193189 (0.003
μM), whereas selumetinib only affects cellular invasion at 0.1 μM. The combinatorial treatment results in a statistically significant increase
of the inhibitory effect of LDN-193189 on invasion. Based on the BI model, the therapeutic interaction of the combination treatment on
invasion was synergistic for both the combinations used. Data presented are mean average of three independent experiments ± S.D. with the
corresponding P-values (n=3, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons).

LDN-193189 (0.003 μM) significantly reduces the motility in both cell lines as compared to the control (P<0.0001), however treatment
with selumetinib alone does not affect motility. Combinatorial treatment significantly decreases MPNST cellular migration in LP ST88-14
(Nf1-/-), whereas the combination treatment effect is insignificant in the LP T265 (Nf1-/-) cells, as compared to treatment with LDN-193189
alone. BI values represent a weakly synergistic to an additive effect of drug combination on motility. Data presented are the average of

independent of the constitutively active RAS-MEKERK pathway in the Nf1(-/-) MPNST cells [24].
Evaluation of the inhibition efficacy of LDN-193189
and selumetinib by western blot analyses (Figure 2A &
2C) showed that inhibition of BMP2 had no effect on
the activation of the MEK-ERK pathway and vice versa.
However, small molecular inhibitors of these distinct
pathways synergistically interacted to decrease survival,
proliferation, invasiveness, and to a limited extent,
migration, of MPNST cells. A likely explanation of the
synergistic interaction of LDN-193189 and selumetinib in
MPNST cells is by cross-talk of BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 and
MEK-ERK pathways via another signaling pathway. For
example, many studies have described the role of BMP
family members including BMP2 in the SMAD1/5/8mediated activation of the p38 MAPK pathway [50-52].
In fact, Boergermann et al. has shown that inhibition of the
SMAD1/5/8 pathway by LDN-193189 results in decreased
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and inhibition of its
subsequent targets in murine myoblast cells [53]. Although
p38 MAPK and MEK-ERK belong to distinct families of
MAPKs, they regulate many of the same downstream
effectors such as ATF1, CREB, p65, eIF4E, etc. [54]. It
is plausible that the propagated downstream effects of the
combinatorial inhibition of MEK1/2 and BMP2 result in
targeting of the same substrates involved in cell survival,
invasion and migration of MPNST cells.
Throughout these studies, therapeutic efficacy of
combinatorial versus single agent treatments was assessed
at biochemically relevant concentrations to avoid offtarget effects. Thereby, these results not only demonstrate
the efficacy of the targeted agents but also highlight the
functional roles of the targeted signaling pathways. For
example, LDN-193189 inhibits invasion and migration
potently at biochemically effective concentrations,
whereas its effects on cell growth and survival are
possibly off-target effects. The cell growth and survival
IC50 for LDN-193189 was ~100-fold higher than the
biochemically relevant concentration required to inhibit
BMP2-SMAD1/5/8 signaling. An independent study of the
effects of LDN-193189 on the proliferation of pancreatic
cancer cell lines corroborates our results as LDN-193189
decreases the number of viable pancreatic cancer cells [55]
within the concentration ranges used in our cell viability
experiments. These off-target effects may be mediated
by LDN-193189’s effects on receptors or kinases other
than BMP Type I receptors. In fact, a study of kinase
specificity of LDN-193189 determined that at 1.0 μM
concentration (within IC50 range in MPNST cells), LDN193189 affects 24 kinases notably RIPK2, GCK, FGF-R1,
etc., independent of its effects on the phosphorylation of
SMAD1/5/8 complex [35]. It is important to note that
kinases of the MAPK pathway were unaffected by 1.0
μM LDN-193189 in the same study, while results from
our western blot analyses concluded that treatment with
up to 1.0 μM LDN-193189 does not affect MEK1/2 in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MPNST cell lines (Figure 2A, 2B). With the demonstrated
lack of adverse side effects of LDN-193189 in animal
studies [43], the inhibition of cell growth by LDN-193189
even at higher concentrations may provide an additional
therapeutic benefit in treatment of MPNSTs. Additionally,
increased cell death in MPNST cells upon combinatorial
treatment with LDN-193189 and selumetinib was
associated with a dose-dependent increase in PARP
cleavage, a marker of apoptosis, as compared to single
treatments with LDN-193189 or selumetinib.
We did not expect that selumetinib at biochemically
relevant concentrations would affect migration or invasion
of MPNST cells, however, results from the in vitro invasion
studies suggest that selumetinib, in addition to suppressing
the growth of MPNSTs, may also provide a significant
benefit by inhibiting the metastatic nature of such tumors.
The combination treatment with both the candidate agents
resulted in a minor yet significant decrease in invasiveness
of MPNST cell lines as compared to treatment with
LDN-193189 alone. The combinatorial effect of LDN193189 and selumetinib on the migratory potential of
MPNST cells ranges from weakly synergistic to additive.
As LDN-193189 is a potent anti-cellular motility agent,
it is possible that the effects of the combination therapy
with the addition of selumetinib are difficult to interpret
in in vitro migration assays. Interestingly, low passage
Nf1(-/-) MPNST cells were more sensitive to selumetinib
in regards to their migratory potential as compared
to the high passage Nf1(-/-) MPNST cells. We had also
found the low passage Nf1(-/-) MPNST cells to be more
sensitive to selumetinib in the cell growth assays (Figure
2D). As low passage cells closely represent the original
properties of MPNSTs, increased drug sensitivity of these
cells advocates the use of the proposed combination
therapy described in this study. Overall, our proposed
combinatorial approach of targeting two independent
signaling networks with biochemically effective doses of
LDN-193189 and selumetinib in physiologically relevant
low passage patient-derived MPNST cell lines provides a
comprehensive treatment strategy to improve the clinical
outcome for MPNST patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and cell lines
All MPNST cell lines used in this study were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, MA)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone
Laboratories, UT). Low passage human MPNST ST8814 (Nf1-/-), and low passage T265 (Nf1-/-) cells were a
generous gift from Dr. Margaret Wallace (Department
of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of
Florida, FL). Specifically, passages: 8-16 for low passage
ST88-14 (Nf1-/-), and passages: 10-18 for low passage
T265 (Nf1-/-) cell lines were used in this study. High

passage human MPNST ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) cells (from T.
Glover, University of Michigan, MI), T265 (Nf1-/-) cells
(from G. De Vries, Hines VA Hospital, Hines, IL), and
STS26T (Nf1+/-) cells (from D. Scoles, Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, CA, USA), were cultured for at least
over 100 passages in our lab. STS26T (Nf1+/-) cell line
was used to establish a stable Nf1 knockdown cell line
using pGIPZ lentiviral Nf1 shRNA vector, Clone ID:
V2LHS_76032 (Open BioSystems, GE Dharmacon,
CO). The infected cells were selected with puromycin
(1.0 μg/mL) for 8 days post-infection. Selected cells
were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy for green
fluorescence protein (GFP) expression, and a pooled
population was maintained in selection media containing
puromycin (0.5 μg/mL) for duration of experiments. Cell
lines were periodically checked and found negative for
mycoplasma using MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection
Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Cultures were
propagated for no more than 3 months at a time.

Cell culture supernatants were collected 24
hours post-incubation in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 0.5% FBS. Conditioned media was collected
and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal
filter units with 3 kDa cut-off (Merck Millipore, MA).
Secreted BMP2 levels were analyzed using the BMP2
Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, MN). Duplicates
of each sample were analyzed per experiment. A
standard curve was generated using optical density
(O.D.) of the BMP2 standards provided by the vendor.
Secreted BMP2 levels for each sample were calculated
against the standard curve and normalized to the
standard medium as well as total protein concentration
in conditioned media.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays
In vitro cytotoxicities of LDN-193189,
and Selumetinib, alone or in combination were
measured by using 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium-bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich)
in MPNST cell lines. After 48 hours of treatment,
MTT was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL,
and solubilized by addition of 0.1 N HCl in anhydrous
isopropanol, after which plates were read within an hour
using a microplate reader at 570 nm, with a background
subtraction of 690 nm. IC50 values were calculated
as drug concentrations necessary to inhibit 50%
growth compared to vehicle-treated control cells using
GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, CA).
The anti-tumor interactions between LDN-193189 and
Selumetinib were determined by standard isobologram
analyses and by evaluating combination index (CI)
values as described below.

RNA extraction and quantitative real time PCR
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, CA). Three batches of total RNA (2.0 μg) for
each cell line were reverse transcribed by SuperScript®
II First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Q-RT-PCR
was performed using Power SYBR Green MasterMix
(Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on the ABI 5700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
The relative fold change was calculated using the CT
method as follows: 2-ΔΔCT, where, ΔΔCT = (CT Bmp2- CT
) experiment - (CT Bmp2 - CT Gapdh) control. Statistical
Gapdh
significance was determined through student’s t-test and a
p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Western blot analyses
Cells grown to 60-80% confluence were washed
with cold PBS, scraped and lysed with RIPA buffer
supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail,
1% PMSF (from stock at 10 mg/ml in methanol), 1
mM Na3VO4, 1 mM Na4P2O7.10H2O, and 1 mM NaF.
Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antineurofibromin 1:600 (#A300-140A, Bethyl laboratories,
TX), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-SMAD1/5/8
1:600 (#9516S, Cell Signaling, MA), mouse
monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 1:1000 (#9106S,
Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-SMAD1/5/8
1:400 (#9106S, Cell Signaling), rabbit monoclonal
anti-ERK1/2 1:1000 (#4695S, Cell Signaling) and
mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (#T5168, SigmaAldrich, MO). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to
IRdye infrared dyes (Rockland Immunochemicals, PA).
Signal was detected using the Odyssey infrared imaging
system and software (Licor Biosciences, NE) and the
protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software.

Flow cytometry and cell cycle analyses
MPNST cells were treated with specified
concentrations of LDN-193189 and/or selumetinib or
with vehicle control (DMSO) for indicated time points.
Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. After which,
cells were stained with propidium iodide staining solution
with RNase A (Cell Signaling Technology) for another
24 hours in the dark at 4°C. Cell cycle analyses and flow
cytometry was performed by the Microscopy, Imaging
and Cytometry Resources Core at Wayne State University,
School of Medicine, using BD LSRII.

Migration and invasion studies
The effects of LDN-193189 and selumetinib
alone, or in combination on MPNST cell invasion were
determined using the CytoSelect™ 96-well cell invasion
assay kit (Cell Biolabs Inc.) as per manufacturer’s

instructions. Cells were pretreated overnight with
indicated concentrations of LDN-193189, selumetinib,
alone or in combination before seeding to the chambers.
FBS used at 10% as the chemoattractant (150 μl), was
added to the feeder tray. After 18 h of incubation, lysate
was transferred to a black walled plate with optical
bottoms (Sigma-Aldrich) and fluorescence measurements
were performed in a fluorescence plate reader
Spectramax I3X (Molecular Devices, CA) at 480 nm/520
nm. The effects of LDN-193189 and selumetinib on
motility was investigated by using CytoSelect™ Wound
Healing Assay Kit as per manufacturer’s instructions
(Cell Biolabs, Inc., CA). Cells were seeded at 4-5×104
cells/well in 24-well plates containing inserts aligned
in the same direction. Migration of cells into the wound
field was followed for the next 24-48 hours after removal
of the inserts. In order to visualize the cell migration
images by fluorescence, low and high passage T265
(Nf1-/-) and ST88-14 (Nf1-/-) cells were infected with
the GFP expressing lentiviral plasmid. Cell migration
activity was determined by quantification of the wound
field area by ImageJ Software (Media Cybernetics, MD)
using fluorescent images, photographed by Olympus
IX71 fluorescent microscope. Wound healing activity is
expressed as the percentage filling the wound field from
three independent experiments.

Statistical analyses and synergy calculations
Paired t-test or ANOVA was used to determine
the significant differences at 95% confidence interval.
One and two-way ANOVA were followed by post-hoc
tests, as indicated. Drug/drug synergy was evaluated
by the Chou combination index (CI) using Compusyn
software (ComboSyn Inc., NJ), where CI < 1, CI = 1,
and CI > 1 indicate synergistic, additive, and antagonistic
effects, respectively. Bliss Independence (BI) model
was used to calculate the therapeutic interactions of
the combination of candidate agents on migration and
invasion because it assumes different, independent,
mutually nonexclusive sites of action for the candidate
agents [56, 57], which is the case in this study. BI model
is applied as follows: BI = ((Fa + Fb) - (Fa × Fb))/Fab where:
Fa = fraction of effect of drug A, Fb = fraction of effect
of drug B, (Fa + Fb) - (Fa × Fb) = predicted sum of the
effects of combination treatment, and Fab = actual effect of
combination therapy found experimentally.
