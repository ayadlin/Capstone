ABSTRACT
Highly malignant tumors express high levels of the minichromosome maintenance
2 (MCM2) protein, which is associated with advanced tumor grade, advanced stage,
and poor prognosis. In a previous study, we showed that Friend leukemia virus (FLV)
envelope protein gp70 bound MCM2, impaired its nuclear translocation, and enhanced
DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in FLV-infected hematopoietic cells when the cells
expressed high levels of MCM2. Here, we show that MCM2 is highly expressed in
clinical samples of invasive carcinoma of the breast, especially triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC), and in cancer stem cell (CSC) marker-positive breast cancer cells.
To generate a cancer therapy model using gp70, we introduced the gp70 protein
into the cytoplasm of murine breast cancer cells that express high levels of MCM2
by conjugating the protein transduction domain (PTD) of Hph-1 to gp70 (Hph1-gp70). Hph-1-gp70 was successfully transduced into the cytoplasm of breast cancer
cells. The transduced protein enhanced the DNA damage-induced apoptosis of cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, an MCM2-targeted strategy using Hph-1-gp70
treatment to induce DNA damage might be a successful therapy for highly malignant
breast cancers such as TNBC and for the eradication of CSC-like cells from breast
cancer tissue.

receptors and HER2, TNBC cannot be treated with hormone
therapy or trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody,
because TNBC tumor cells lack these specific targets [8, 9].
Consequently, patients with TNBC have worse outcomes
after chemotherapy than patients with other breast cancer
subtypes [10]. Thus, novel therapies that target highly
malignant TNBC are needed to improve breast cancer
prognosis.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to contribute
to tumor initiation and maintenance, chemotherapy
resistance, tumor relapse, and metastasis [11–14].
Therefore, for the successful treatment of many types of
cancer, strategies that target CSCs are also needed. Multiple
markers such as CD13, CD44, delta-like homologue 1,
CD133, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH-1) have
been used to isolate and identify CSCs in various tumors

INTRODUCTION
Invasive carcinoma, a common breast malignancy, is
a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide
[1]. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Molecularly
distinct subtypes have different characters of biological
behaviors and prognoses [2]. Immunohistochemical
evaluation of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PgR), Ki-67, and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) is commonly used to identify the four molecular
subtypes: HER2-type, luminal-type, luminal/HER2-type,
and triple negative (TN)-type. Importantly, the subtypes
have different clinical outcomes [3–6]. In particular, TN
breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with an increased risk
of early relapse, usually within 5 years from the initial
diagnosis [7]. Unlike tumors that overexpress hormone

[15–18]. In particular, CD44, CD133, and ALDH-1 have
been used as CSC markers for the enrichment of CSCs in
breast cancer [19–21].
Minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 is one
of six related proteins that comprise the MCM complex
(MCM2–7), which has an essential role in DNA replication
[22]. Previous studies with human samples have established
MCM2 as a proliferation marker. A high level of MCM2
expression in malignant tumors is associated with several
clinicopathological parameters such as advanced tumor
grade, advanced stage, and poor prognosis [23–26].
Previously, we showed that Friend leukemia virus (FLV)
infection markedly enhanced the irradiation (IR)-induced
apoptosis of hematopoietic cells in C3H mice expressing
high levels of MCM2 via the activation of ATM, DNA-PK,
and P53 [27]. Apoptosis was enhanced almost exclusively
in the C3H strain [28]. We also demonstrated that the FLVderived envelope protein gp70 enhanced cellular apoptotic
signaling specifically in cells that overexpressed MCM2
[29]. Gp70 bound directly to the nuclear localization
signal of MCM2 and inhibited its nuclear translocation.
The cytoplasmic MCM2-gp70-complex bound to protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), interfered with the PP2A-DNAPK interaction, and enhanced DNA damage-induced
apoptosis via the activation of p53 by DNA-PK [30]. These
results suggest that regulation of the molecular dynamics
of MCM2 by using gp70 offers a novel therapeutic
approach by which malignant tumors that express high
levels of MCM2 can be specifically eliminated. To develop
an MCM2-targeted therapy, a method for efficiently
introducing gp70 protein into cancer cells is required.
We focused on a protein delivery system that uses
the protein transduction domain (PTD). PTD is a peptide
sequence that can penetrate the cell membrane [31–33].
PTD has been widely used as a carrier for the delivery
of various proteins into living cells. Protein transduction
therapy using PTD for the intracellular delivery of a
protein is an alternative approach to viral gene therapy
[34]. Recently, a novel PTD was identified in the human
transcription factor Hph-1. The Hph-1 PTD has been used
to deliver immunosuppressive proteins in vitro and in vivo
for the treatment of autoimmune diseases [35, 36].
In the present study, we analyzed the expression
of MCM2 in HER2, luminal, luminal/HER2, and TN
subtypes of human breast cancer. Furthermore, we
introduced gp70 into murine breast cancer cells using PTD
and investigated whether gp70 had apoptosis-enhancing
effects in solid tumors such as breast cancers.

performed using specimens from human cases with invasive
carcinoma of no special type (Figure 1A). The labeling index
of MCM2 in the TN group was significantly higher than the
indices in all other subtype groups (Figure 1B). The MCM2
labeling index of the HER2 and luminal/HER2 groups was
higher than that of the luminal group (Figure 1B).

Cancer stem cell markers are frequently
expressed in TNBC and colocalize with MCM2
Two patterns of CD133 expression were identified:
staining of the cell membrane (Figure 1C, top-left) and
staining of the cytoplasm (Figure 1C, top-middle). In
contrast, ALDH-1 was exclusively expressed in the
cytoplasm (Figure 1C, top-right). The frequency of
CD133-positive cases was highest in the TN group
(40.0%, 8 of 20), followed by the HER2 group (30.0%,
9  of 30), luminal/HER2 group (27.6%, 8 of 29), and
luminal group (8.0%, 2 of 25) (Table 1). The membrane
staining pattern of CD133 was most frequently observed
in the TN group (37.5%), followed by the HER2 group
(22.2%), luminal/HER2 group (12.5%), and luminal
group (0%). However, the cytoplasmic staining pattern of
CD133 was most frequently observed in the luminal group
(100%), followed by the luminal/HER2 group (87.5%),
HER2 group (77.8%), and TN group (62.5%) (Table 1).
The percentage of ALDH-1-positive cases was highest in
the TN group (25.0%, 5 of 20), followed by the HER2
group (23.3%, 7 of 30), luminal/HER2 group (17.2%, 5 of
29), and luminal group (12.0%, 3 of 25) (Table 1).
Next, we performed double immunostaining for
CD133 or ALDH-1 and MCM2 in cases that were positive
for CSC markers (Figure 1C, bottom). Colocalization of
MCM2 and CD133 was most frequently observed in the
TN group (87.5%, 7 of 8), followed by the HER2 group
(66.7%, 6 of 9), luminal/HER2 group (50.0%, 4 of 8),
and luminal group (0%, 0 of 2) (Table 1). The labeling
index of MCM2 was significantly higher in the CD133/
MCM2 colocalized group than in the non-colocalized
group (Figure 1D). Colocalization of MCM2 and ALDH-1
was most frequently observed in the HER2 (100%, 7 of 7)
and luminal/HER2 (100%, 5 of 5) groups, followed by
the TN group (60.0%, 3 of 5) and luminal group (0%,
0 of 3) (Table 1). The labeling index of MCM2 was higher
in the ALDH-1/MCM2 colocalized group than in the
non-colocalized group, although the difference was not
statistically significant (Figure 1E). These results suggest
that the CSC markers are highly expressed in TNBC cases
and that the markers frequently colocalize with MCM2.

their expression levels of ER, PgR, and Her2 were much
lower than those of the control uterine tissue, FM3A and
MTT060562 cells exhibited higher expression levels of ER
and Her2 than 3T3 cells. FM3A cells had higher expression
of PgR than 3T3 cells (Figure S1). To investigate the Hph1-mediated transduction of gp70 into murine breast cancer
FM3A and MTT060562 cells, we generated DNA constructs
and expressed and purified control-gp70, Hph-1-gp70, and

whether lower concentrations of the recombinant proteins
could be efficiently transduced into the cells, 1 × 106 FM3A

The transduction of gp70 was then  assessed using western
blot analysis (Figure 2D). Hph-1-gp70 was transduced into
the cytoplasm of the cell lines in a concentration-dependent
manner. Transduced gp70 was  detected in FM3A cells
incubated with ≥ 100 nM of Hph-1-gp70 and in MTT060562
and 3T3 cells incubated with ≥  500 nM of Hph-1-gp70
(Figure 2D). To measure the time course of Hph-1-gp70
transduction, 1 μM of Hph-1-gp70 was incubated with
1 × 106 FM3A, MTT060562, and 3T3 cells for 0, 15, 30,
60, and 120 min, and gp70 transduction was assessed with
western blot analysis (Figure 2E). Hph-1-gp70 was first
detected at 15 min, and the maximum concentration was
reached in less than 60 min in FM3A, MTT060562, and 3T3
cells (Figure 2E). These results suggest that Hph-1-gp70 is
rapidly introduced into the cytoplasm of the various cells
tested.

Hph-1-gp70 enhances DNA damage-induced
apoptosis
After treatment with Hph-1-gp70, the apoptotic cell
ratio increased in FM3A and MTT060562 cells, which
express high levels of endogenous Mcm2 compared
to control-gp70. In contrast, the apoptotic ratio did not
increase when the cells were treated with Hph-1-GFP
(Figure 4A and 4B). However, treatment with Hph-1-gp70
did not significantly change the apoptotic cell ratio of 3T3
cells, which express low levels of endogenous  Mcm2
(Figure 4C). As expected, the apoptotic cell ratio of 3T3
cells overexpressing HA-MCM2 was higher after treatment
with Hph-1-gp70 than after treatment with Hph-1-GFP
(Figure 4C). Moreover, we confirmed that treatment with Hph1-GFP or Hph-1-gp70 did not cause any significant changes
in the cell cycle profiles of FM3A (Figure 4D), MTT060562
(Figure 4E), and 3T3 cells (Figure 4F). These results
indicate that a certain expression level of MCM2 is required
for the enhancement of apoptosis by gp70.
As shown in Figure 4G, FM3A, MTT060562,
and  HA-Mcm2-expressing 3T3 cells treated with
Hph-1-gp70 and doxorubicin expressed higher levels of
DNA-PK, phospho-DNA-PK, P53, phospho-P53, and
cleaved caspase-3 compared to cells treated with Hph1-GFP and doxorubicin.
Treatment with siRNA (si-Mcm2) significantly
reduced the expression of Mcm2 mRNA in FM3A and
MTT060562 cells (Figure 4H and 4I). In contrast to the
increased apoptotic cell ratios observed in FM3A and
MTT060562 cells treated with si-Control, the apoptotic
cell ratios in FM3A and MTT060562 cells treated with
si-Mcm2 did not change markedly after Hph-1-gp70
and doxorubicin treatment (Figure 4J and 4K). Taken
together, these results suggest that Hph-1-gp70 bound
directly to MCM2, inhibited the translocation of MCM2
to the nucleus by forming a cytoplasmic MCM2-gp70
complex, and strongly enhanced the frequency of
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

Hph-1-gp70 binds MCM2 directly
The basal levels of endogenous MCM2 mRNA
and protein were significantly higher in FM3A and
MTT060562 cells than in 3T3 cells (Figure 3A). We next
examined the intracellular interaction between Hph-1-gp70
and MCM2. Control-gp70, Hph-1-gp70, or Hph-1-GFP
(1 μM) was incubated with 1 × 106 FM3A, MTT060562,
and 3T3 cells for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation experiments
revealed that Hph-1-gp70 bound to endogenous MCM2 in
FM3A and MTT060562 cells (Figure 3B), but not in 3T3
cells (data not shown). However, Hph-1-gp70 bound to
MCM2 in 3T3 cells when the cells were transfected with
an expression plasmid encoding HA-conjugated MCM2
(Figure 3B).
In Hph-1-GFP-treated FM3A cells, MCM2 was
not detected in the cytoplasmic fractions. By contrast,
MCM2 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction of FM3A
cells treated with Hph-1-gp70 (Figure 3C). Furthermore,
MCM2 localized to the nucleus of Hph-1-GFP-treated
MTT060562 (Figure 3D, top) and HA-Mcm2-expressing
3T3 cells (Figure 3E, top). However, MCM2 remained
in the cytoplasm of Hph-1-gp70-treated cells, in which
Hph-1-gp70 colocalized with endogenous MCM2 in

samples from Hph-1-gp70-injected mice exhibited strong
expression of gp70 (Figure 6A, bottom-right), whereas no
gp70 expression was detected in Hph-1-GFP-injected mice
(Figure 6A, top-right), which exhibited strong expression

a low dose of doxorubicin enhanced apoptosis in Hph-1gp70-injected SCID mice but not in Hph-1-GFP-injected

apoptosis in FM3A cells in vivo. Next, tumor growth
was analyzed in vivo in SCID mice treated with Hph-1GFP or Hph-1-gp70 and doxorubicin twice a week after
the establishment of the FM3A tumor mass. When mice
injected with Hph-1-gp70 and doxorubicin were compared
with mice injected with Hph-1-GFP and doxorubicin, the
former exhibited smaller tumor sizes and slower tumor
expansion (Figure 6D). A survival analysis was also
performed with each experimental group of mice. Mice
treated with Hph-1-gp70 and doxorubicin exhibited a
significant improvement in survival when compared with
the other groups of mice (Figure 6E). These results show
that breast cancer therapy with Hph-1-gp70 and a low-dose
of doxorubicin was effective in vitro and in vivo.

DISCUSSION
The MCM complex associates with origins of
DNA replication to form part of the pre-replicative
complex [37]. MCM proteins are usually expressed in
cycling cells [38] and are frequently overexpressed in a
variety of cancer and pre-cancerous cells [23–26, 39, 40].
In breast cancer, high expression of MCM2 is associated
with several clinicopathological parameters, such as
advanced tumor grade, advanced stage, and poor prognosis
[41, 42]. Moreover, according to an NCBI GEO database
(accession number: GDS2250), the expression of MCM2
is significantly higher in basal-like breast cancer than in
normal breast cells and non-basal-like breast cancer cells.
According to another NCBI GEO database (accession
number: GDS4051), the expression of MCM2 is higher
in the tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7
than in tamoxifen-sensitive MCF7 cells. Among the four
molecular subtypes that we analyzed, the expression of
MCM2 was particularly high in TNBC. These results
suggest that cancer therapy targeting MCM2 will be
useful for TNBC, the subtype that has lacked a specific
therapeutic target.
Previous studies have suggested that the phase of the
cell cycle changes after MCM2 knockdown using siRNA
[43–45]. In the present study, we found that gp70 bound
to with MCM2 and inhibited its nuclear translocation.
However, the cell cycle profiles of the murine tumor lines
were not changed by gp70 transduction (Figure 4D).
In the present study, Hph-1-gp70-treated MTT060562
and 3T3 cells had MCM2 cytoplasmic fractions, yet a
significant amount of MCM2 still localized to the nucleus
(Figure 3D, 3E). We speculate that the cell cycle did not
change because of the level of MCM2 that remained in the
nucleus. However, gp70 was able to retain a significant
amount of MCM2 in the cytoplasm to enhance apoptosis.
p53 is mutated or inactivated with high frequency
in human breast cancer tumor cells [46]. Our study used
murine breast cancer cell lines FM3A and MTT060562
that have wild-type p53 (Figure S3A). However, in 8047
cells used in our previous study, p53 has the R172H
mutation (Figure S3B). Indeed, the p53 mutation (R175H)
is frequently found in human breast cancers and other
types of cancer [47]. Our previous study showed that
therapy using gp70 enhanced apoptosis in 8047 cells [30].
In the present study, we evaluated the apoptotic cell ratio
of Hph-1-gp70-treated 8047 cells after treatment with
doxorubicin to induce DNA damage to determine whether
this treatment is effective in a mutant p53 background.
Indeed, treatment with Hph-1-gp70 increased the apoptotic
index of 8047 cells (Figure S3C). Therefore, even in cells
harboring p53 mutations, gp70 therapy may have similar
effects as in tumors with wild-type p53. In addition,
many reports have showed that anticancer agents are not

MCM2 is highly expressed in FM3A cells with
high CD133 expression
Next, to evaluate the relationship between the
localization of CSC markers and MCM2, we performed
double immunostaining for CD133 and MCM2 in FM3A
transplanted SCID mice. As shown in Figure 7A, CD133
highly expressing (CD133-high) FM3A cells frequently
colocalized with MCM2 in vivo. Therefore, to examine
the expression level of MCM2 in CD133-high breast
cancer cells, we separated and enriched CD133-high cells
from other FM3A cells. The robust expression of CD133
in the separated FM3A cells was confirmed by FACS
(Figure 7B). Approximately 7% of FM3A cells were
CD133-high cells (Figure S2). As expected, the mRNA
and protein levels of MCM2 were significantly higher
in CD133-high FM3A cells than in CD133-low FM3A
cells (Figure 7C). Moreover, CD133-high or CD133low FM3A cells exhibited no remarkable change in their
cell-cycle profiles (Figure 7D). It is widely accepted that
cells expressing CSC markers have drug resistance. The
present study revealed that the apoptotic cell ratio after
doxorubicin treatment was significantly lower in CD133high FM3A cells than in CD133-low FM3A cells (Figure
7E). After Hph-1-gp70 treatment, doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis was enhanced in CD133-low FM3A cells.
Strikingly, Hph-1-gp70-induced apoptosis was at similar
levels in CD133-high and low FM3A cells (Figure 7E).
Furthermore, protein levels of DNA-PK, phospho-DNAPK (pS2053), P53, phospho-P53, and cleaved caspase-3
were lower in CD133-high FM3A cells than in CD133low FM3A cells after treatment with doxorubicin. After
Hph-1-gp70 treatment, the levels of these proteins were
remarkably elevated in CD133-low and CD133-high
FM3A cells (Figure 7F). These results suggest that
the treatment of cells with Hph-1-gp70 and a low dose
of doxorubicin strongly activate apoptosis, even in

as effective against breast cancer cells that have mutant
p53 [48, 49]. However, other reports have indicated that
high dose therapy with alkylating agents is effective
against breast cancer cells that have mutant p53 [50].
Thus, cancer therapy using gp70, which enhances DNA
damage-induced apoptosis, might be effective against p53mutated breast cancer cells in combination with low doses
of anticancer agents.
Previous studies have reported that activated DNAPK stabilized MDM2 leading to the prevention of p53
degradation [51]. Our study suggests that over-activated
DNA-PK is associated with p53 stabilization and activation.
This result was obtained from our data showing that total
p53 and phosphorylated (active) p53 levels increased to a
similar extent in cells treated with Hph-1-gp70.
Because CSCs are associated with recurrence or
distant metastasis after cancer therapy, it is important to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

develop methods that target these cells in order to improve
the outcome of conventional cancer therapy [14, 52, 53].
Several reports indicate that CD133 and ALDH-1 are
useful for identifying CSC-like populations in different
malignancies and that CSCs are potential targets of
therapy [54–57]. Furthermore, MCM2 is highly expressed
in CSCs of retinoblastoma and glioblastoma [58, 59]. In
the present study, CD133 and ALDH-1 were expressed
in several breast cancer samples. CD133 and ALDH1 were expressed more frequently in the TNBC group,
which expressed high levels of MCM2, than in the other
cancer subtypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed
that MCM2 colocalized with CD133 in TNBC cells.
Furthermore, MCM2 expression was higher in CD133high FM3A cells than in CD133-low FM3A cells. Thus,
therapies targeting MCM2-targeting may be effective
against TNBC cells and CSC-like breast cancer cells.

Cancer stem cells are considered a very small
fraction of cells in the cancer cell population. In the
present study, CD133 was positive in about 7% of murine
breast cancer cell line FM3A (Figure S2). Previous studies
demonstrated that cells expressing CD133 or ALDH1 have a stemness property [60–62]. On the other hand,
our study and previous studies showed that CD133 and
ALDH-1 are frequently expressed in various cancer
types [63–66]. However, CD133 or ALDH-1 positive
cancer cells may not necessarily possess a stemness
property. Instead, these cells may have a relatively poorly
differentiated character and stem cell-like phenotype.
These cells may be “immature” tumor cells having
stemness functions including drug resistance.
To develop a novel method for the transduction of
gp70 into cancer cells, we focused on a protein delivery
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

system that uses the PTD. The discovery of the PTD has
made it possible to transduce therapeutically active agents
into living cells [67, 68]. The most extensively studied
PTDs are those of the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription
protein (TAT), Drosophila homeodomain transcription
factor Antennapedia (ANTP), and herpes simplex virus
structural protein VP22 [69–73]. These PTD sequences
are enriched with arginine residues, and short sequences
with 6–30 consecutive arginine residues are functional
PTDs [74–76]. Recently, a novel PTD was identified in
the human transcriptional factor Hph-1. A previous study
showed that Hph-1-PTD has good protein transduction
efficiency and can deliver therapeutic protein in vitro and
in vivo [35, 36, 77]. In the present study, we conjugated
Hph-1-PTD to gp70 (Hph-1-gp70). In vitro, Hph-1-gp70
was rapidly and effectively introduced into breast cancer

cell lines, in which it bound to MCM2 in the cytoplasm
and enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis in cells
expressing high levels of MCM2. Moreover, in an
FM3A-bearing mouse model, gp70 was introduced into
tumor cells through an intraperitoneal injection of Hph1-gp70. Mice injected with Hph-1-gp70 and treated with
doxorubicin exhibited a smaller tumor size and significant
improvement in survival. Moreover, similar results were
obtained in experiments using the ovarian cancer cell line
T-Ag-MOSE (Supplementary Figure S4 and S5). These
results suggest that Hph-1-gp70 offers a novel strategy for
the treatment of breast cancer and other types of cancer.
In a previous study, we showed that the cytoplasmic
localization of the MCM2-gp70 complex promoted
the interaction of MCM2 with PP2A [30]. In this study,
Hph-1-gp70 and MCM2 complex bound to PP2A
(Figure 5D). PP2A has been shown to dephosphorylate
DNA-PK and inhibit its function [78–80]. These results
suggested that the Hph-1-gp70 and MCM2 complex
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bound to PP2A and inhibited the function of PP2A.
Consequently, DNA-PK was hyperphosphorylated and
enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis via a p53/
cleaved caspase 3 pathway.
Recent progress in CSC research has revealed the
molecular mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy and has contributed to the development
of effective chemotherapeutic regimens [81]. Several
studies have demonstrated an association between CSCs
and drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines [82, 83].
CD133-high FM3A cells were resistant to doxorubicininduced apoptosis in the present study. After Hph-1-gp70
treatment, doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was enhanced
not only in CD133-low FM3A cells but also in CD133high cells. These results suggest that Hph-1-gp70 and
low-dose doxorubicin treatment is an effective approach
for killing cancer cells including CSCs, the treatment of
which might prevent cancer relapse and metastasis. In
the clinical setting for breast cancer therapy, neoadjuvant

chemotherapy (NAC) regimens usually include doxorubicin
or its derivatives [83, 84]. Thus, a therapeutic strategy using
Hph-1-gp70-MCM2 might be a novel and effective NAC
approach to treat breast cancer.
In conclusion, our data suggest that cancer therapy
using Hph-1-gp70 and doxorubicin is effective for treating
cancers with high MCM2 expression, including CSCs.
Although several problems must be solved with regard to
its application in humans, cancer therapy that exploits the
apoptosis-enhancing effect of MCM2 might offer a cure
for various cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical samples

Cell lines

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
of invasive carcinoma of no special type (ductalNST) [85,   86] were used in this study. The molecular
subtypes of breast cancer were defined using the
immunohistochemical surrogate markers ER, PgR, and
HER2. The HER2 subtype was defined as ER-, PgR-, and
HER2+. The luminal subtype was defined as ER+ and/or
PgR+ and HER2-. The luminal/HER2 subtype was defined
as ER+ and/or PgR+ and HER2+. The TN subtype was
defined as ER-, PgR-, and HER2-. In total, 104 FFPE
samples of invasive carcinoma of no special type were
collected from breast cancer patients who underwent
surgery, including 30 patients with the HER2 subtype
(median age, 56.5 [range, 33–76 years]), 25 patients with
the luminal subtype (median age, 51 [range, 23–81 years]),
29 patients with the luminal/HER2 subtype (median age,
48 [range, 29–73 years]), and 20 patients with the TN
subtype (median age, 58 [range, 34–80 years]). The FFPE
samples were collected at the Cancer Institute Hospital,
Tokyo, Japan in 2012. A list of the samples used in this
study is summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The
human study was approved by the ethics committees
of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (No.  1458)
and Cancer Institute Hospital (No. 2014–1003), and
all procedures were performed in accordance with
the ethical standards established by these committees.
The experiments conformed to the principles set out in
the WMA Declaration at Helsinki and the Department of
Health and Human Services Belmont Report.

The FM3A cell line derived from C3H mouse breast
cancer cells was purchased from the JCRB Cell Bank
(Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan) and cultured in MEM (Wako,
Tokyo, Japan). 3T3 cells derived from BALB/c mouse
fibroblast cells were purchased from the RIKEN Cell
Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) and cultured in DMEM
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The MTT060562
cell line derived from C3H mouse breast cancer cells and
T-Ag-MOSE cell line derived from C3H mouse ovarian
cancer cells were purchased from the JCRB Cell Bank
(Ibaraki, Oosaka, Japan) and cultured in DMEM (Sigma
Aldrich). The radiation-induced myeloid leukemia cell
line from C3H mice, 8047, was established at the National
Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba [29]. The cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich).
The data of T-Ag-MOSE and 8047 cell lines were shown
in Supplementary Figures. Medium was supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/mL;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and streptomycin
(50 μg/mL; Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Generation of Hph-1 fusion proteins to introduce
proteins into cells
Gp70 was amplified from the cDNA of FLVinfected 8047 cells by using PCR primers. The primers,
synthesized at a commercial laboratory (Invitrogen), were
GAAAGATCTAAAAGGTCCAGCGTTCTCAAA and
GAAGGTACCCTATGCAGCTATGCCGCCCATAG. GFP
was amplified from the pSUPER vector (Oligoengine,
Seattle, WA, USA) by using PCR primers. The primers,
synthesized at a commercial laboratory (Invitrogen), were
GAAAGATCTGCCACAACCATGGTGAGCAAG and
CCCAAGCTTCTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC.
The PCR products were subsequently cloned into
the bacterial recombinant protein expression vector
pRSET C (Invitrogen). Hph-1-gp70 and Hph-1-GFP
proteins contained the sequence for 2 × Hph-1-PTD

Immunohistochemistry
FFPE tissue sections (4-μm thick) were used for
immunohistochemistry. Deparaffinization was followed
by heat-based antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase
blockade with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and blocking with
normal sera. The primary antibodies used were as follows:

The FLAG sequence was inserted between the Hph-1
and gp70 sequences. gp70 lacking Hph-1-PTD was also
constructed and purified for use as a negative control.
The protein expression vectors were transformed
into Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS cells

buffer (6 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mM
NaCl). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and
cOmplete His-tag Purification Resin (Roche) was added.
Bound proteins were washed and eluted with 300 mM
imidazole. Eluted proteins were desalted using PD-10
Sephadex G-25 (BD Biosciences), supplemented with
10% glycerol, and frozen at −80°C for later use.

and 3T3 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated
control-gp70 or Hph-1-gp70. After incubation, FM3A
cells were washed PBS, and fluorescence was detected
by a flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto™ Cell Analyzer;
BD Biosciences). MTT060562 and 3T3 cells were
washed PBS, and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (life
technologies, CA, USA). Images were acquired using a
BZ-9000 microscope (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan) with a
400 × objective.
To monitor MCM2 localization after treatment
with gp70, MTT060562 and 3T3 cells were fixed in 1%
paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1%
NP-40 in PBS at room temperature. Cells were incubated
with a rabbit monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (InvivoGen)
and a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (InvivoGen)
or monoclonal anti-MCM2 antibody (BD Biosciences)
at a 1:100 dilution in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
Cells were then stained with a FITC-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Dako) and a tetramethylrhodamine5-(and-6)-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated anti-mouse
antibody (Dako) at a 1:100 dilution for 20 min at room
temperature. Slides were washed three times with PBS
and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium
containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector
Laboratories). Images were acquired using a BZ-9000
microscope (KEYENCE) with a 400 × objective.

Immunoblotting
FM3A, MTT060562, and 3T3 cells, before and
after treatment with transduction proteins, were used
for western blotting. The samples were loaded onto a
5%–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Wako, Tokyo,
Japan) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (GE Healthcare, Danbury, CT, USA). The
membranes were blocked with 10% skim milk in PBS.
The primary antibodies were anti-FLAG M2 mouse
monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich), anti-HA mouse
monoclonal antibody (Sigma Aldrich), anti-MCM2
mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), antiDNA-PKcs mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz

(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), antiGFP mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam), anti-PP2A
rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)
and anti-GAPDH rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies were
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG (GE Healthcare) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(GE Healthcare). Protein expression was detected using
the Clarity™ Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA).

Chromatin loading assay
Chromatin loading of MCM2 was performed as
described previously [30]. Briefly, FM3A cells were lysed
by incubating in complete cytoskeleton (CSK) buffer
(20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 mM
sucrose, and 0.1% NP-40) for 15 min on ice. Cytoplasmic
fractions were obtained as supernatants after low speed
centrifugation (3,000 × g) at 4°C. Pellets were rinsed with
complete CSK buffer for 10 min on ice and centrifuged
again to obtain a chromatin-enriched fraction. Pellets were
then sonicated for 5 s in CSK buffer and subjected to highspeed centrifugation (16,000 × g). The post-sonication
supernatant was designated as the chromatin-bound
fraction.

Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were prepared by incubating cell pellets
on ice for 1 h in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02%
NaN3, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% aprotinin, 100 μM leupeptin,
and 100 μM TPCK (Sigma Aldrich). Cell lysates were
incubated with antibody and Protein G Sepharose™
(GE Healthcare). Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates
obtained after centrifugation were mixed with 2 × sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl at pH 6.8,
4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and
10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min.

Immunofluorescence
To monitor the control-gp70 and Hph-1-gp70 protein
in living cells, these proteins were labeled with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) by using Fluorescein Labeling KitNH2 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). FM3A, MTT060562,

Separation of CD133-high cells among
FM3A cells

Analysis of cell cycle distribution

CD133-positive cells were separated from FM3A
cells using a pluriBead kit (pluriSelect, San Diego, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the total population of FM3A cells was incubated
with 50 μL of beads directly conjugated to rabbit antimouse CD133 antibody (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) at
room temperature for 30 min. The suspended cells were
added to a cell strainer. The labeled CD133-high cells
were retained on the cell strainer, and the unlabeled
cells were eluted. Subsequently, the separated cells were
incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD133 antibody
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA USA) and analyzed on a
flow cytometer (BD FACSCanto™ Cell Analyzer).

Cell cycle distribution was monitored by quantifying
the cellular DNA content after staining with PI. Cells
were fixed with ethanol for 20 min at − 20°C. After
centrifugation, cells were suspended in PBS containing PI
(50 μg/mL) and RNase (0.2 mg/mL), incubated at room
temperature for 30 min, and analyzed on a flow cytometer
(BD FACSCanto™ Cell Analyzer).

The siRNA sequence for si-Mcm2 was
CAGGTGACAGACTTTATCAAA. An irrelevant siRNA
(si-Control; GCACACAGACTGCAATCACAGGTTA)
that did not lead to the specific degradation of any

Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). To evaluate the therapeutic effect
of Hph-1-gp70 and low-dose doxorubicin, FM3A cells
(2 × 106 cells/50 μL PBS) were inoculated subcutaneously
into the left flank of mice. One week after transplantation,
mice were treated twice a week with an intraperitoneal
injection of 5 mg of Hph-1-gp70 or Hph-1-GFP and
with 1.5 mg/kg of doxorubicin. The tumor volumes were
calculated weekly as (width)2 × length × 0.52. The animal
experiments were conducted and carried out in strict
accordance with the Act on Welfare and Management of
Animals of the government of Japan and the Guidelines
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
Tokyo Medical and Dental University. All experiments
were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of
Tokyo Medical and Dental University (No. 100115). The
animals were housed in standard cage at 25°C, in a 12/12
light-dark cycle in a clean room. All efforts were made to
minimize suffering in animal experiments.

SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from FM3A, MTT060562
and 3T3 cell lines by using TRIzol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
the liquid phase was incubated with chloroform for
phase separation. Total RNA was extracted using one
isopropanol precipitation step and one ethanol wash.
The RNA pellet was diluted in RNase- and DNase-free
water (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was generated
from the RNA using TaqMan® Reverse Transcription
Reagents (Applied Biosystems [ABI], Foster, CA,
USA), and quantitative RT-PCR was performed. For
quantitative RT-PCR, specific primers were used with

Data are presented in the figures as the mean
± SD. For each figure, statistical tests are justified as
appropriate. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to
analyze the immunohistochemistry data obtained using
human invasive breast cancer samples. For Kaplan-Meier
analysis of SCID mice transplanted with FM3A cells, a
log-rank test was performed. The statistical significance
in in vitro experiments was determined using a two-tailed
Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
