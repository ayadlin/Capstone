Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with poor outcomes with current therapies.
Gemcitabine is the primary adjuvant drug used clinically, but its effectiveness is limited. In this study, our
objective was to use a rationale-driven approach to identify novel biomarkers for outcome in patients with earlystage resected PDAC treated with adjuvant gemcitabine. Using a synthetic lethal screen in human PDAC cells, we
identiﬁed 93 genes, including 55 genes linked to DNA damage responses (DDR), that demonstrated gemcitabine
sensitization when silenced, including CHD7, which functions in chromatin remodeling. CHD7 depletion
sensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine and delayed their growth in tumor xenografts. Moreover, CHD7 silencing
impaired ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 and increased DNA damage induced by gemcitabine. CHD7
was dysregulated, ranking above the 90th percentile in differential expression in a panel of PDAC clinical
specimens, highlighting its potential as a biomarker. Immunohistochemical analysis of specimens from 59
patients with resected PDAC receiving adjuvant gemcitabine revealed that low CHD7 expression was associated
with increased recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), in univariate and multivariate analyses.
Notably, CHD7 expression was not associated with RFS or OS for patients not receiving gemcitabine. Thus, low
CHD7 expression was correlated selectively with gemcitabine sensitivity in this patient population. These results
supported our rationale-driven strategy to exploit dysregulated DDR pathways in PDAC to identify genetic
determinants of gemcitabine sensitivity, identifying CHD7 as a novel biomarker candidate to evaluate further for
individualizing PDAC treatment. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2677–87. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis with a 5year overall survival (OS) rate around 5% (1). Patients with
early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma who undergo resection
demonstrate the best prognosis, particularly when resection is
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (2, 3). Still, recurrence is common and OS remains poor
even for patients who undergo complete resection and adjuvant therapy. Recent developments have suggested that pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a genetically heterogeneous disease

predictive biomarkers for responsiveness to adjuvant therapy.
Gemcitabine is the primary chemotherapeutic agent used to
treat patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the adjuvant
setting (2, 5). The cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine are mediated
in part through incorporation into DNA as a terminal nucleoside analog and in part through inhibition of ribonucleotide
reductase, which depletes nucleotides required for DNA synthesis. However, the efﬁcacy of gemcitabine for pancreatic
adenocarcinoma is limited. A better understanding of which
patients are likely to respond to gemcitabine treatment would
facilitate personalization of therapy and optimize the clinical
beneﬁt to toxicity ratio associated with adjuvant therapy.
The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway is critical for the
maintenance of genome integrity and serves as a cancer barrier
by mobilizing DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, and/or apoptosis
(6, 7). In human precancerous lesions, aberrant DNA replication induces DDR activation, which constrains tumor development. Thus, the DDR acts as a barrier against genomic
instability and cancer development. Tumor cells may in turn
develop mutations or epigenetic silencing of protective DDR
genes, leading to the proliferation of genetically unstable
cells and ultimately resulting in cancer. Indeed, a large number
of DDR genes are somatically mutated in pancreatic

adenocarcinoma, including ATM, BRCA2, CDKN2A, FANCI,
HELB, and RAD9 (8). These genetic changes in the DDR
pathway can lead to pancreatic adenocarcinoma and can also
weaken the ability of cancer cells to respond to treatment by
decreasing activity in DNA repair pathways. Often, the cancer
cell will become reliant on backup pathways that can be
targeted to cause cell death through the principal of synthetic
lethality (inactivation of one gene or pathway is sublethal but
inactivation of both causes cell death). As such, determining
genetic alterations and cancer treatments that are synthetically lethal may lead to the identiﬁcation of novel druggable
targets as adjuncts to gemcitabine treatment or novel biomarkers to predict response to gemcitabine therapy. Using this
rationale, we sought to exploit dysregulated DDR pathways in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma by identifying genetic determinants that are synthetically lethal with gemcitabine treatment
and evaluating their clinical relevance as biomarkers for outcome in patients with early-stage resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant gemcitabine.
Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 (CHD7), is a
member of a family of chromodomain enzymes that belong to
the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein SNF2 superfamily. Mutations in CHD7 lead to congenital CHARGE syndrome, named for its characteristic traits: coloboma of the eye,
heart defects, atresia of the nasal choanae, retardation of growth
and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and
ear abnormalities and deafness (9), and Kallman Syndrome, a
genetic disorder marked by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
and anosmia (10). CHD7 is also dysregulated in 13% to 35% of
cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with aberrant expression,
copy-number variation, and somatic mutations (see Supplementary Table S3; refs. 11–13). CHD7 helps to regulate neural
crest gene expression (14), regulates ribosomal RNA biogenesis
(15), and interacts with SOX2 to regulate gene expression (16).
CHD7 is also a putative substrate of the ATM/ATR checkpoint
kinases, suggesting that it may play a role in the DDR (17, 18).
The clinical signiﬁcance of CHD7 expression in pancreatic
adenocarcinoma has not previously been reported.
The purpose of this analysis was to use a rationale-driven
approach to identify novel biomarkers for outcome in patients
with early-stage resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated
with adjuvant gemcitabine (Fig. 1A). We initially completed a
synthetic lethal siRNA screen to identify genetic determinants of
gemcitabine sensitivity in human pancreatic cancer cells and
identiﬁed the top 15% of these genes for further analysis. Genes
validated by a secondary screen and/or linked to the DDR were
then analyzed for dysregulation and differential expression in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma by mining published data sets to
determine their potential as biomarkers. Finally, we correlated
CHD7 gene expression characterized by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) with clinical outcome in patients with early-stage resected
pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant gemcitabine.

and 2.5% horse serum (Gibco). HPAC cells were grown in 1:1
DMEM:Hams F12 supplemented (Gibco) with 40 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 10 ng/mL EGF, and 5% FBS. BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells
were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, and
CAPAN-1 cells were grown in Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's
Medium supplemented with 20% FBS. Cell lines were grown in
a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C with 5% carbon dioxide.
Transfections were done using the HiPerFect Transfection
Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Primary and secondary screen siRNAs were purchased from

TRC lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was purchased
from Thermo Scientiﬁc: shControl (RHS4080), shCHD7-1
(1RHS3979-201747986), shCHD7-2 (1RHS3979-201747990).
Gemcitabine sensitivity screen
MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected in 96-well plates using
HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) with 25 nmol/L
siRNA from a custom siGENOME siRNA library (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) of 4,024 siRNAs corresponding to 1,006 unique
human nuclear enzyme genes (pools of four siRNAs targeting
a unique sequence of each gene) using a one gene per well
format. Twenty-four hours later, plates were split 1:4, and then
treated following another 24 hours with or without 13 nmol/L
gemcitabine (Hospira, Inc.) for 72 hours before assaying for cell
proliferation using WST-1 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Each
plate contained two positive controls (ATR and CHK1) and
several negative controls (NT), and plate-to-plate variability
was controlled by normalizing the values on each plate to the
average of the negative control values on that plate. A ratio of
gemcitabine treated/untreated viability was calculated and
normalized to that of nontargeting siRNA. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to account for possible variability between the cell viability of the three replicates for each
gene. These genes were then sorted by increasing average cell
viability via PCA, and the top 15% of genes were categorized as
possible "hits."
Secondary validation screen
MIA Pa-Ca 2, BxPC3, or HPAC cells were transfected in
96-well plates with 25 nmol/L siRNA, split 1:4 24 hours later,
and then treated following another 24 hours with or without
gemcitabine at IC5, IC25, or IC50 for 72 hours before assaying
for cell proliferation using WST-1 reagent. A ratio of gemcitabine treated/untreated viability was calculated and
normalized to that of nontargeting siRNA. MIA PaCa-2,
HPAC, CAPAN-1, BxPC3, and AsPC-1 cells were treated

antibody (NBP1-77393; Novus Biologicals) and anti-GAPDH
antibody (GeneTex; GTX627408) followed by LI-COR IRDye
secondary antibodies. Detection was performed using the
Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences).
To analyze phosphorylation of CHK1, MIA PaCa-2 cells
were transfected with 25 nmol/L siRNA for 48 hours and
treated with 1 mmol/L gemcitabine for 6 hours. Cells then
were harvested, washed with PBS, and lysed in cold RIPA
buffer (25 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 minutes. Lysates were
clariﬁed by centrifugation at 16 g for 10 minutes and 150
mg of protein for each sample were used for Western blot
analysis. Primary antibody pCHK1 S317 (Cell Signaling
Technology; #2344) and CHK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
sc-8408) were used for detection of phosphorylated and total
CHK1, respectively.
In vivo tumor growth inhibition assay
Male nude mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment, and all in vivo procedures were approved by the
Emory University, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Stable MIA PaCa-2 shCHD7-2 and MIA PaCa-2 shControl
cells (1.5  106/0.1 mL of 20% Matrigel gel in serum-free media)
were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂank of 5-week-old
mice. Mice bearing established tumors (100 to 125 mm3) were
randomized into treatment groups of four. Animals were
treated on days 0, 7, and 14 via the tail vein with either vehicle
or 100 mg/kg gemcitabine. Tumor growth inhibition was
determined as described previously (19).
gH2AX DNA damage assay
MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with or without 13 nmol/L
gemcitabine for 20 hours, washed, released for the indicated
time points, and processed for gH2AX staining by indirect
immunoﬂuorescence. Cells were washed with 1 PBS, ﬁxed
with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientiﬁc),
and blocked in a 5% bovine serum albumin solution (Sigma).
Cells were then immunostained with anti-phospho-histone
H2AX (Ser139) antibody (Millipore; 05-636) and anti-mouse
secondary antibody with AlexaFluor-488 (Invitrogen; A21206).
After incubation, cells were mounted onto slides with a
mounting media containing 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and dried. Analysis was performed using a Zeiss
Observer Z1 microscope with Axiovision Rel 4.8 software using
the 63 oil objective. Foci quantitation was conducted by
counting 250 healthy cells and scoring cells with 10 or more foci
as positive. Experiments were done in triplicate.
Cell-cycle analysis
MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected with 25 nmol/L siRNA for
48 hours and treated with or without gemcitabine (13 nmol/L)
for 24 hours. After ﬁxing with ice-cold 70% ethanol, cells were
washed in PBS, and propidium iodide (PI; 25 mg/mL; Sigma)
and RNase A (10 mg/mL; Qiagen) were added to determine DNA
content. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.

Biomarker selection
Gemcitabine sensitivity genes validated on secondary
screen or known DDR genes were analyzed for evidence of
dysregulation by identifying genes overexpressed in The
Compendium of Potential Biomarkers of Pancreatic Cancer
(20) or somatically mutated in the pancreatic Catalogue for
Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (11). For
determination of differential expression, we extracted
expression data from the two Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) submissions based on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0
platform: (i) GSE12654, a 22 pancreatic cancer cell line study
(19); and (ii) GSE16515, 20 pancreatic patient tumors (21,
22). Within each study, after processing and normalization,
we performed a genomewide ﬁlter to identify genes with
"large" expression differences among tumors, and separately,
among cell lines, using a variance approach. We deﬁne
"differential expression" as genes whose expression variability is "large" relative to all other genes on the array, in which
"large" is deﬁned according to whether expression variability
associated with a gene was greater than the 90th percentile
from all genes. We then compared this list of genes with the
lists in Supplementary Tables S2 and S4. CHD7 was chosen
as a potential biomarker based on evidence of both dysregulation and differential expression.
IHC patient selection
Patients were selected for this analysis from a prospectively
maintained database of patients who underwent resection for
early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma between January 2000
and October 2008; data for these patients have been included in
other cohorts previously reported (23–26). These 59 patients
received adjuvant chemotherapy with or without adjuvant
radiation. The gemcitabine patient population was composed
of 42 of these patients who received gemcitabine as a component of the adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. An additional
17 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with agents other
than gemcitabine. OS was calculated from date of surgery to
patient death. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was measured on
the basis of surveillance imaging obtained at regular intervals
after resection. Patient demographics, pathologic characteristics, and treatment characteristics were originally collected
from pathologic record and chart review. Permission was
obtained from the Emory Institutional Review Board
00048816, and patient conﬁdentiality was maintained according to the Health Insurance and Patient Accessibility Act of
1996.
Immunohistochemical analysis
An experienced pathologist identiﬁed representative sections of tumor and normal tissue from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁnembedded slides. The tissue was stained using an anti-CHD7
mouse monoclonal antibody (NBP1-77393; Novus Biologicals)
at a concentration of 1:200. Speciﬁcity of the anti-CHD7
antibody was validated by Western blot analysis following
siRNA silencing (Fig. 2B). An expression score was calculated
using a previously deﬁned scoring system (23, 27). Overall score
was dichotomized into low (<3.1) and high (>3.1) expression
groups for this analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were generated for patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, and treatment characteristics.
Similar statistical analyses were performed for patients receiving adjuvant therapy, patients receiving gemcitabine-based
therapy, and patients receiving non-gemcitabine-based therapy. Kaplan–Meier log-rank survival analysis was performed to
determine prognostic factors for RFS and OS. Univariate and
multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed for all
patients to examine the correlation of CHD7 expression level
on both RFS and OS. Factors examined on univariate analysis
included age, sex, ethnicity, receipt of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, tumor size, margin status, grade, nodal status,
perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, receipt of radio-

therapy, CA19-9 levels, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Clinically relevant covariates signiﬁcant to a level of P < 0.2 on
univariate analysis for either RFS or OS were included in the
multivariate model; these included tumor size, margin status,
nodal status, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion,
and tumor grade. Data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences 19.0 software for Windows
(IBM).

gemcitabine in human pancreatic cancer cells. Because gemcitabine induces DNA damage and replication stress, we
reasoned that gemcitabine sensitivity genes would likely be
involved in the DDR. We, therefore, optimized a high-throughput assay using ATR and CHK1 siRNA as positive controls and a
nontargeting siRNA as a negative control with cell proliferation
as a read-out (Fig. 1B). The primary screen was completed in
MIA PaCa-2 cells, which consistently gave the highest signalto-noise ratio among several tested cell types (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and data not shown). Brieﬂy, cells were transfected
with pools of four siRNAs targeting a unique sequence of each
gene arrayed in a one gene per one well format in 96-well plates.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with or
without 13 nmol/L gemcitabine (equivalent to IC25 under these
conditions, see Fig. 2E) for 72 hours before assaying for cell
proliferation using WST-1 reagent. Each plate contained two
positive controls (ATR and CHK1) and several negative controls (NT), and plate-to-plate variability was controlled by
normalizing the values on each plate to the average of the
negative control values on that plate. We completed three
replicas of the primary screen using a library of 4,024 siRNAs,
corresponding to four unique siRNA duplexes, targeting each
of 1,006 unique human genes (Fig. 1C). The library consisted
predominantly of nuclear enzymes, which we reasoned were
more likely to function directly in the DDR and be targetable.
Results of the primary screen were ranked by PCA score
(Supplementary Table S1). The top 15% of these genes (156
genes) included 55 genes linked to the DDR (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2; and Supplementary Table S2) including wellcharacterized ATR signaling pathway genes ATR, CHK1, RAD9,
RAD1, and HUS1 and nucleotide metabolism genes RRM1 and
RRM2, known to regulate gemcitabine sensitivity (28), demonstrating that our screen can yield DDR genes that determine

Sixty-eight of our hits were identiﬁed in previously published
DNA damage sensitivity screens (17, 20, 29–36) and 27 are
putative ATM/ATR substrates (17; Supplementary Table S3).
We used these criteria to validate 47 of the 99 hits not
characterized in the DDR in a secondary screen using deconvoluted individual siRNAs to conﬁrm their gemcitabine sensitivity and eliminate false positives due to off-target effects,
and 38 of these genes induced gemcitabine sensitivity in at
least two out of four siRNAs tested, including CHD7 (Supplementary Table S4). Four of 4 siRNAs targeting CHD7 caused
gemcitabine sensitization (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis
conﬁrmed decreased levels of CHD7 following siRNA knockdown as well as speciﬁcity of the anti-CHD7 antibody used for
IHC analysis (Fig. 2B). A similar gemcitabine sensitization after
CHD7 silencing was observed using a range of gemcitabine
concentrations and in BxPC-3 and HPAC pancreatic cancer
cells, suggesting that the phenotype is not cell-type speciﬁc
(Supplementary Fig. S3A–C). CHD7 silencing in the absence of
gemcitabine treatment reduced cell viability (Supplementary
Fig. S3D). We also determined the gemcitabine sensitivity of
CHD7-depleted cells using a colony formation assay. MIA
PaCa-2 cells silenced for CHD7 demonstrated a signiﬁcantly

reduced percentage of surviving colonies following a 24-hour
pulse of gemcitabine in a dose-dependent manner compared
with a NT control (Fig. 2C), conﬁrming the gemcitabine
sensitization of CHD7-depleted cells observed with WST-1
reagent. Consistent with these ﬁndings, MIA PaCa-2 and
BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells, which express lower levels of
CHD7 than HPAC, CAPAN-1, and AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer
cells, demonstrated increased gemcitabine sensitivity (Fig. 2D
and E), suggesting that CHD7 expression may predict response
to gemcitabine in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. To determine if CHD7 silencing causes gemcitabine sensitization of
pancreatic cancer tumors in vivo, we generated a xenograft
model using MIA PaCa-2 cells stably expressing shCHD7 or
shControl (Fig. 2F). CHD7 silencing signiﬁcantly delayed tumor
growth in mice treated with gemcitabine compared with a
control treated with gemcitabine (Fig. 2G), suggesting that
CHD7 silencing also causes gemcitabine sensitization in vivo.
No signiﬁcant difference in body weight was observed in mice
bearing tumors with shCHD7 compared with shControl and
treated with or without gemcitabine (Supplementary Fig. S4).
CHD7 is a DDR protein
The gemcitabine hypersensitivity of CHD7-depleted cells
suggests that CHD7 may function in the DDR. CHD7 silencing
signiﬁcantly increased the percentage of cells staining with
gH2AX, a marker for DNA damage, following treatment with
gemcitabine (Fig. 3A), suggesting that CHD7 silencing potentiates gemcitabine-induced DNA damage. However, no signiﬁcant difference in repair kinetics was observed between cells
silenced with CHD7 compared with a nontargeting siRNA (Fig.
3A). CHD7-silenced cells showed a decreased percentage of
cells in S phase and an increased percentage of cells in G2–M in
the absence of gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S5A); however, no signiﬁcant difference in cell-cycle proﬁle was
observed between CHD7-depleted compared with NT control
cells following gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S5B). There was also no signiﬁcant difference in protein levels
of CHD7 in response to gemcitabine treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6). To determine whether CHD7 functions in ATRdependent signaling in response to gemcitabine treatment, we
examined cells for the phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser317. CHD7
silencing signiﬁcantly reduced CHK1 Ser317 phosphorylation
but not total CHK1 protein levels in response to gemcitabine
treatment (Fig. 3B), suggesting that CHD7 functions in controlling ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 in response
to gemcitabine treatment.
CHD7 is dysregulated and differentially expressed in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Genes validated by our secondary screen or linked to the
DDR were then analyzed for dysregulation and differential
expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma by mining of published data sets to determine their potential as biomarkers. Of
these, eight genes demonstrate aberrant expression or somatic
mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table S3) as reported in The Compendium of
Potential Biomarkers (20) and the COSMIC database (11).
Twelve of the genes are above the 90th percentile in differential

cell lines or 20 pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples (Fig.
3C and Supplementary Table S3; refs. 21, 22). Four of the genes
exhibit both dysregulation and differential expression, including CHD7, which was selected for further analysis as a
biomarker.
Survival analyses
Patient demographics, pathologic and treatment characteristics can be seen in Table 1. CHD7 expression was low in 84.7%
of patients. Median tumor size was 3.4 cm (range, 1–6 cm), and
60% of patients were node positive. In addition to CHD7
expression, signiﬁcant covariates on univariate analysis included tumor size, margin status, lymph node status, perineural
invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and grade
(P < 0.2). On Kaplan–Meier analysis for patients receiving
gemcitabine as a component of adjuvant therapy (n ¼ 42), low
CHD7 expression was associated with increased RFS (15 vs.
7 months; P ¼ 0.025; Fig. 4A) and increased OS (18 vs. 10 months;
P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 4B). On multivariate analysis (Table 2), low CHD7

expression remained associated with increased RFS [HR, 0.12;
95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.04–0.42; P ¼ 0.001] and increased
OS (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03–0.29; P < 0.0001). In the subset of
patients receiving adjuvant therapy with agents other than
gemcitabine [most commonly 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)], CHD7
was not associated with RFS (P ¼ 0.1, data not shown) or OS
(P ¼ 0.4, data not shown). On Kaplan–Meier analysis for all
patients (n ¼ 59), low CHD7 expression via IHC scoring was
associated with increased RFS (15 months vs. 7 months; P ¼
0.015; Fig. 4C) and increased OS (19.5 months vs. 9 months; P ¼
0.001; Fig. 4D). These results remained signiﬁcant on multivariate analysis (Table 3). To ensure stability of the multivariate
model given the small number of events, the three least significant factors on univariate analysis were removed from the
model (grade, PNI, and LVI) and the signiﬁcance of CHD7
expression remained unchanged.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate a rationale-driven approach for
identifying novel biomarkers for outcome in patients with earlystage resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant gemcitabine. Using a synthetic lethal screen to identify
genetic determinants of gemcitabine sensitivity in human
pancreatic cancer cells, we identiﬁed 93 genes that, when

silenced, demonstrate gemcitabine sensitization, including
CHD7. CHD7 deﬁciency caused gemcitabine sensitization in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and delayed pancreatic tumor
xenograft growth in mice treated with gemcitabine. We further
found that CHD7 knockdown impaired ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 and increased DNA damage induced by
gemcitabine, revealing a novel function for CHD7 as a DDR
protein, which maintains genome integrity in response to
gemcitabine. We examined CHD7 as a potential biomarker
based on its dysregulation and differential expression in a panel
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues. Finally, we
found that low CHD7 expression is associated with improved
RFS and OS in patients with early-stage resected pancreatic
adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant gemcitabine. These
ﬁndings support our rationale-driven approach in exploiting
dysregulated DDR pathways in pancreatic adenocarcinoma to
identify genetic determinants of gemcitabine sensitivity that
can be translated to novel biomarkers or drug targets.

Cancer Res; 74(10) May 15, 2014

A third of the genes identiﬁed in our primary gemcitabine
sensitivity screen are linked to the DDR, including ATR signaling pathway genes ATR, CHK1, RAD9, RAD1, HUS1, and
CDK9 (37) and nucleotide metabolism genes RRM1 and RRM2.
CHD7 was previously identiﬁed as a putative ATM/ATR substrate (17). Our ﬁnding that CHD7 silencing in human pancreatic cancer cells potentiates gemcitabine-induced DNA
damage and impairs CHK1 Ser317 phosphorylation in
response to gemcitabine treatment suggests that CHD7 also
functions in the ATR signaling pathway and helps to explain at
least in part why CHD7 knockdown causes gemcitabine sensitization in cells and in vivo. Still, the cell-cycle effects of CHD7
expression require further understanding through future studies, which remain ongoing. For example, CHK1 inhibition has
been shown to potentiate gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity by
inducing premature mitosis (38). A number of genes identiﬁed
in our screen, including RRM1, RRM2, and CHK1 have previously been shown to determine gemcitabine sensitivity in

human pancreatic cancer cells (39), and low RRM2 expression
has been shown to be associated with improved outcome in
patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (24) and speciﬁcally
those treated with adjuvant gemcitabine (28), providing validation for our screen in identifying gemcitabine sensitivity
genes that may function as potential biomarkers. Several of the
gemcitabine sensitivity genes, including PLK1 and AURKB, are
involved in mitotic progression that is in part targeted by
nanoparticle albumin bound (nab)-paclitaxel (Abraxane; Celgene), which potentiates gemcitabine sensitivity and improves
survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with gemcitabine (40, 41). It is thus possible that the
gemcitabine sensitivity genes reported in this study may also
be novel druggable targets to be used in combination with
gemcitabine. Indeed, PARP2, a target of PARP inhibitors that
sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine (42, 43), was
also identiﬁed in our screen.
In our clinical data, low CHD7 expression was associated
with increased OS and RFS in all patients receiving adjuvant
therapy, although this was likely driven by the inclusion of
patients receiving gemcitabine. The association of low CHD7
expression with increased survival was magniﬁed in patients
receiving gemcitabine as a component of their adjuvant therapy despite smaller patient numbers, indicating that low CHD7

expression may indeed be associated with gemcitabine sensitivity in these patients. In contrast, CHD7 expression in
patients not receiving gemcitabine was not statistically significant. This analysis is underpowered with limitation of small
sample size and selection bias, but our ﬁndings provide
valuable hypothesis-generating data suggesting that CHD7
may have predictive value in these patients.
Given the evidence that patients with low CHD7 expression
demonstrate improved outcomes, it is possible that adjuvant
therapy regimens could be tailored to individualize patient
treatment based on CHD7 expression. This should be examined in future prospective trials and in larger secondary
analyses of completed prospective studies. Although adjuvant
chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is
advantageous, the ideal drug regimen remains unclear. The
beneﬁt of adjuvant gemcitabine compared with adjuvant 5-FU
in patients with early-stage resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Both the
ESPAC-3 trial, which randomized patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma to adjuvant gemcitabine versus 5-FU,
and the RTOG 97-04 trial, which randomized patients with
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma to adjuvant pre- and
postchemoradiotherapy gemcitabine versus 5-FU, reported no
signiﬁcant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or OS

between the two arms (3, 44). Our ﬁnding that low CHD7
expression is associated with improved outcome in patients
with early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant gemcitabine suggest that, once validated, CHD7 expression could potentially be used as a predictive biomarker to
individualize adjuvant therapy for these patients. In addition,
the optimal radiation dose and fractionation for patients with
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains unknown, and
molecular biomarkers to guide adjuvant therapy decisions are
essential (45). The potential utility of CHD7 expression as a
prognostic and potentially predictive biomarker still remains
a hypothesis-generating observation and requires validation
in a prospective clinical trial, in which regimen dosing and
duration are more homogenous.
Interest in genetic sequencing data, such as with The
Cancer Genome Atlas and other similar projects, continues
to increase (46, 47), leading to rapidly increasing knowledge
of genes expressed and mutated in speciﬁc cancer types
including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. As this knowledge
becomes available, it is crucial that an approach be developed to help identify those genes that may serve as clinically
relevant prognostic or predictive biomarkers or potential
drug targets for novel therapeutics. The successful identiﬁcation and validation of CHD7 as a novel gemcitabine
sensitivity gene that is associated with outcome in patients
with early-stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with
adjuvant gemcitabine is evidence that our approach may be
successful in identifying other clinically relevant biomarkers
or drug targets.
It is worth noting that recent advances in chemotherapy
have increased the use of FOLFIRINOX therapy in the metastatic setting, impacting the potential utility of this study. Still,
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the
metastatic setting equivalently recommend FOLFIRINOX or
two gemcitabine-based regimens (gemcitabine with the addition of erlotinib or nab-paclitaxel), both with category one
evidence (24). In addition, gemcitabine or ﬂuoropyrimidine
therapies are still recommended in the adjuvant setting, which
is where this study's clinical focus remains. Future studies
should evaluate the predictive role of CHD7 in a larger,
randomized prospective trial to validate potential gemcitabine
sensitivity genes in a similar fashion to other identiﬁed pre-

dictive biomarkers (48). The current study suggests that CHD7
may be a useful biomarker for determining which patients will
derive greater beneﬁt from gemcitabine therapy, providing
clinicians a way to better select patients for speciﬁc adjuvant
therapy regimens in the future.
