Abstract

Introduction

Sagopilone (ZK-EPO) is the first fully synthetic epothilone
undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of human tumors.
Here, we investigate the cellular pathways by which sagopilone blocks tumor cell proliferation and compare the intracellular pharmacokinetics and the in vivo pharmacodynamics
of sagopilone with other microtubule-stabilizing (or tubulinpolymerizing) agents. Cellular uptake and fractionation/
localization studies revealed that sagopilone enters cells more
efficiently, associates more tightly with the cytoskeleton, and
polymerizes tubulin more potently than paclitaxel. Moreover,
in contrast to paclitaxel and other epothilones [such as the
natural product epothilone B (patupilone) or its partially
synthetic analogue ixabepilone], sagopilone is not a substrate
of the P-glycoprotein efflux pumps. Microtubule stabilization
by sagopilone caused mitotic arrest, followed by transient
multinucleation and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway. Profiling of the proapoptotic signal transduction
pathway induced by sagopilone with a panel of small interfering RNAs revealed that sagopilone acts similarly to paclitaxel. In HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells, sagopilone-induced
apoptosis was partly antagonized by the knockdown of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bax, Bak,
and Puma, whereas knockdown of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Chk1
sensitized cells to sagopilone-induced cell death. Related to
its improved subcellular pharmacokinetics, however, sagopilone is more cytotoxic than other epothilones in a large panel
of human cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In particular,
sagopilone is highly effective in reducing the growth of
paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells. These results underline the
processes behind the therapeutic efficacy of sagopilone, which
is now evaluated in a broad phase II program. [Cancer Res

Microtubules constitute dynamic tubulin structures that can
be targeted for the treatment of cancer due to their critical role
in mitosis and other cellular processes (reviewed in refs. 1–3).
Taxanes, which include paclitaxel, are tubulin-targeting agents
that have been widely used in the treatment of breast cancer, non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, and
prostate cancer (4). The strong cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel results
from mitotic arrest followed by apoptotic cell death (5). However, the therapeutic use of taxanes is limited by an intrinsic or
acquired resistance phenomena and poor solubility, which requires
Cremophor EL formulations (6, 7). Among the multiple reasons
accounting for taxane resistance, two mechanisms seem particularly important, namely overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
efflux pumps (8) and h-tubulin mutations (9, 10).
Epothilones constitute a new alternative class of tubulin-binding
compounds (11, 12). Some epothilones exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity against P-gp–overexpressing tumor cells, compared with
paclitaxel (13–15), and certain epothilone derivatives are poorly
recognized by P-gp pumps (16, 17). This suggests that some
epothilones may overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms, which would augment their therapeutic potential. Natural
epothilones, however, are not optimal candidates for anticancer
therapy for a number of reasons, including a limited therapeutic
index and poor tolerability (18–20). Because of this, novel epothilone derivatives have been synthesized and investigated in preclinical models (17–20).
Sagopilone (ZK-EPO) is the first fully synthetic epothilone
undergoing clinical trials (21). Previous results from our group
indicated that sagopilone is not exported by P-gp efflux pumps and
that it exerts cytotoxic effects against a panel of tumor models (21).
Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
cytolytic activity of sagopilone that involves mitotic blockade
followed by activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In
particular, we identify proteins of the Bcl-2 family as major
regulators of sagopilone-induced cell death. Moreover, we show
that sagopilone is far more effective than other microtubule
stabilizers in inducing the polymerization of tubulin in vitro and
that it exhibits an improved intracellular pharmacokinetics, in part
due to the fact that it is not a substrate of P-gp efflux pumps.
Finally, we extend our previous observations and confirm the
anticancer activity of sagopilone against a wide variety of human
cancers, including those refractory to conventional therapy, in vitro
and in vivo.

Materials and Methods

Results

Chemicals. cis-Diammineplatinum(II) dichloride (cisplatin), DNase I,
docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin hydrochloride), paclitaxel, and verapamil hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
[3H]paclitaxel (10.1 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals,
Inc., whereas the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 was from the National Cancer
Institute. Epothilone B (patupilone) and D, ixabepilone, and sagopilone
were produced in the Bayer Schering Pharma AG Laboratories through
total syntheses (21). The pan caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonylVal-Ala-Asp(OMe).fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from
Bachem AG. Stock solutions were prepared and stored as previously
detailed (18).
Cellular uptake of radiolabeled compounds. Tumor cells (3  104)
were seeded in 24-well plates in 0.5 mL of growth medium per well.
After 2 d, the medium was replaced with a fresh one containing either
3.5 or 70 nmol/L radiolabeled sagopilone or paclitaxel. At the indicated
time points, cells were washed twice with growth medium, lysed in
0.3 mL PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) SDS (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25 units/mL
DNase I, followed by radioactivity quantification in LS3801 liquid
scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Cell number was estimated
in parallel wells and the bound radioactive compound is expressed as
pmol/106 cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
at least twice. One representative experiment (mean F SE, n = 3) is shown
in Results.
Subcellular distribution of radiolabeled sagopilone and paclitaxel.
A549 cells (2  106) were cultured in 10-cm-diameter Petri dishes for 2 d,
then the medium was replaced with 5 mL of a fresh one containing 5 ACi
(corresponding to 35 nmol/L) radiolabeled sagopilone or paclitaxel. After
2 h, cellular fractionation was performed by means of the ProteoExtract kit
(Merck KGaA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by
immunoblot analysis and quantification of radiolabeled sagopilone and
paclitaxel. A549 cell fractions prepared in the same manner were also
subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for a-tubulin
(Sigma-Aldrich), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and
histone H3 (both from Millipore).
In vitro tubulin polymerization. In vitro microtubule assembly was
assessed using a commercial fluorescence-based tubulin polymerization
assay (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Polymerization rates were calculated from five parallel assays and are
reported as mean values F SE.
Detection of activated caspases by precipitation with biotinVAD.fmk. HCT 116 cells (5  106) were incubated with 50 Amol/L biotinVAD.fmk (ICN Pharmaceuticals) or DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) control for 2 h at
37jC and then left untreated or incubated with sagopilone for 48 h.
Alternatively, biotin-VAD.fmk was added to cells pretreated for 42 h with
sagopilone for additional 6 h. Thereafter, cells were lysed in 200 AL of lysis
buffer containing 150 mmol/L KCl, 50 mmol/L HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS
(pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation of lysates at 15,000  g for 10 min,
collection of supernatants, and denaturation (5 min, 100jC). Finally, lysates
were precipitated at 4jC for 4 h (under agitation) with 30 AL of streptavidinagarose beads, after which they were washed thrice with lysis buffer (4jC,
10 min, under agitation) and resolved by SDS-PAGE (22). Caspases were
detected by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for caspase-9 and
caspase-3 (Cell Signalling Technology).
Transfection and RNA interference. The knockdown of proteins
reported in Supplementary Table SI was performed with previously
validated, specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) purchased from SigmaProligo. siRNAs for the down-regulation of Bax and Bak (Hs_BAK1_5 and
Hs_BAX_10 HP) were purchased from Qiagen. As a control, a siRNA with an
unrelated, scrambled sequence was used.
HCT 116 cells in six-well plates were transfected at 30% to 40%
confluence with HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen), following standard
procedures (23). Alternatively, HCT 116 cells were transfected in 96-well
plates for 24 h, as previously reported (24, 25), then treated with 30 nmol/L
sagopilone, 30 nmol/L paclitaxel, or 20 Amol/L cisplatin for 48 h before the
assessment of cell viability.

Subcellular distribution of sagopilone and its effects on
tubulin dynamics. Radioactive sagopilone was efficiently taken
up by A549 NSCLC cells, resulting in a maximal intracellular
concentration of 6.6 pmol/106 cells, which was reached as early as
2 h after addition of the compound. In comparison, paclitaxel
accumulated to a maximal concentration of 5 pmol/106 cells only
after 24 hours of incubation (Fig. 1A). Subcellular fractionation
assays showed that, after 2 hours of treatment, sagopilone almost
exclusively localizes to the cytoskeletal compartment of cells,
whereas paclitaxel mainly associates with membranes and nuclei
(Fig. 1B). Stabilization of microtubules by drugs is known to reduce
the solubility of tubulin, resulting in a redistribution of the protein from the cytosolic (soluble) to the cytoskeletal (insoluble)
fraction. This relocalization was more pronounced after a short
treatment (2 hours) with sagopilone than after an equivalent
incubation with paclitaxel (Fig. 1C) and correlated with the higher
intracellular concentration attained by sagopilone compared with
paclitaxel at this time point. The improved effect of sagopilone on
tubulin polymerization, as well as its strong association with
microtubules, was consistently observed in several cell lines of
distinct origin, including NSCLC A549 (Fig. 1), epidermoid cancer
A-431, cervical carcinoma HeLa/MaTu/Adr, and ovarian carcinoma
NCI/Adr cells (not shown). The association of sagopilone with
polymerized microtubules in the cytoskeletal fraction suggests that
sagopilone displays a particularly potent effect on tubulin
polymerization. This was confirmed in vitro using a fluorescencebased assay. Sagopilone induced an accelerated tubulin polymerization in vitro, compared with paclitaxel and the natural product
epothilone B (patupilone; Fig. 1D). Thus, initial polymerization
rates (mean F SE, n = 8) of patupilone and paclitaxel amounted to
70 F 7% and 30 F 3%, respectively, of those observed for
sagopilone. Altogether, these data support the hypothesis that
sagopilone exhibits favorable subcellular pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamics.
Sagopilone activates mitochondrial apoptosis after cell
cycle arrest. In contrast to the normal bipolar mitosis observed
in untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), sagopilone induced
mitotic figures characterized by monopolar (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), tripolar (Supplementary Fig. S1C), and higher-order
multipolar spindles (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Kinetic analysis
revealed that sagopilone first reduced the number of cells reaching
anaphase and telophase (witnessing mitotic arrest at metaphase)
and then multinucleation (Supplementary Fig. S1E). In addition,
sagopilone activated the spindle assembly checkpoint at concentrations as low as 100 pmol/L (i.e., lower than the IC50; see below),
as indicated by the recruitment of Bub1 to mitotic spindles
(Supplementary Fig. S1F and G). Following the arrest in the G2-M
phase of the cell cycle (maximal at 24 hours), an increasing
percentage of cells underwent apoptosis and exhibited a sub-G1
DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S1H). As confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, at 48 hours, a substantial fraction
of cells exhibited multinucleation or had broken down into
apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2). Videomicroscopic observation of cells
expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion protein (that allows for the
visualization of chromatin) further showed that sagopilone induces
a mitotic blockade followed by multinucleation and/or apoptosis
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3 and Videos S1-S5).
Sagopilone-induced cell death was accompanied by the release
of cytochrome c from mitochondria (resulting in a diffuse cytochrome c–specific immunofluorescence staining pattern), followed

Antitumor Effects of ZK-EPO, a Novel Epothilone

Figure 1. Sagopilone is quickly taken up by cells, localizes to cytoskeletal compartments, and induces rapid tubulin polymerization. A, NSCLC A549 cells were
incubated with 3.5 nmol/L 3H-labeled sagopilone (Sag ) or paclitaxel (Pac ) for the indicated time, followed by quantification of intracellular radioactivity. Symbols
report the intracellular concentration of sagopilone and paclitaxel, expressed as pmol/106 cells. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. B, A549 cells were incubated with
3.5 nmol/L radioactive sagopilone or paclitaxel for 2 h, and then subjected to subcellular fractionation. Finally, the radioactivity of fractions was determined by h-counting
and expressed as percentage of the radioactivity of nonfractionated samples. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. C, subcellular fractions obtained as in B were
subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize a-tubulin, GAPDH, and histone H3. D, 3.5 nmol/L sagopilone, paclitaxel, and patupilone (Pat ) were tested
for their potential to induce tubulin polymerization in vitro, by means of a fluorescence-based commercial assay. Baseline fluorescence levels and control kinetics,
as obtained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ), are also reported. The plot is representative of five independent assessments, which yielded similar results.

by caspase-3 proteolytic activation (detected with an antibody that
recognizes an epitope specifically accessible on active caspase-3;
Fig. 2B; ref. 26). In addition, cells treated with sagopilone lost their
mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW m) before they died
(Fig. 2C). Sagopilone-induced DW m dissipation was inhibited by
overexpression of the viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis
(vMIA, a Bax antagonist) from human cytomegalovirus (Fig. 2C;
refs. 27, 28). Next, we aimed at identifying the apical caspases
activated in response to sagopilone, by means of a biotinylated
caspase inhibitor (biotin-VAD.fmk), which ‘‘traps’’ the first activated caspases by covalently binding to their heavy subunit (22).
When biotin-VAD.fmk and sagopilone were coadministered to cells
and 48 hours later biotinylated proteins were purified from cell
extracts, caspase-9 (but not caspase-8) could be detected (Fig. 2D).
These results suggest that caspases are activated as a consequence
of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, through a canonical pathway that involves caspase-9 and caspase-3 as the initiator and
executioner caspases, respectively (29).
Sagopilone induces cell death through an apoptotic
pathway that implicates the Bcl-2 family of proteins. With a
panel of previously validated siRNAs that target several apoptosis
regulatory proteins, we compared the apoptotic pathways triggered
by cisplatin, paclitaxel, and sagopilone in HCT 116 colorectal
cancer cells. Paclitaxel- and sagopilone-induced cell death exhibited a similar pattern of modulation by distinct siRNAs, which was
rather dissimilar from that observed with cisplatin (Fig. 3A). Thus,

www.aacrjournals.org

although all these agents induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial
pathway, they act through distinct upstream regulators. Among the
most efficient inhibitors of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis were
siRNAs that knock down proapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2
family (in particular Bax and Bak, alone or in combination, Bim
and Puma) as well as caspase-2 and caspase-3. The knockdown of
these proteins also inhibited apoptosis triggered by sagopilone,
although to a lesser extent, whereas Bim and Puma were not
involved in cisplatin-induced cell death. Conversely, constituents of
the permeability transition pore complex like the adenine
nucleotide translocase (ANT) isoform 2 and the voltage-dependent
anion channel isoforms 1 and 2 were implicated as proapoptotic
effectors in cisplatin-induced apoptosis, but had no effect on the
lethal pathways initiated by paclitaxel and sagopilone. Moreover, we found ANT3 depletion sensitized cells to the apoptotic
effects of paclitaxel and sagopilone but not of cisplatin. Of note,
knockdown of Bcl-XL and/or Bcl-2 sensitized cells to paclitaxel
and sagopilone (Fig. 3A), supporting the general conclusion that
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (which is inhibited by
Bcl-XL and Bcl-2) is a major rate-limiting step in sagopiloneinduced apoptosis. Accordingly, the genetic knockout of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-XL antagonist bax partially reduced cell
death induced by sagopilone in mouse embryo fibroblasts (Fig. 3B)
and human HCT 116 colon cancer cells (Fig. 3C). On the other
hand, the ablation of p53 (Fig. 3B and C) or the transgenic
overexpression of the caspase-inhibitory protein p35 (Fig. 3D) had

Figure 2. Sagopilone promotes mitotic catastrophe and mitochondrial apoptosis. A, human colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells were treated with 30 nmol/L sagopilone
and processed for transmission electron microscopy observation. After 18 h of incubation, sagopilone-treated cells manifested alterations in the arrangement of
chromosomes, which appeared dispersed in the cytoplasm outside the metaphase plate (I ). Alternatively, or in addition, sagopilone induced the generation of
multinucleated cells (II ). After 36 h, the typical hallmarks of apoptosis were observed. White bars, picture scale. B, HCT 116 cells seeded on L-polylysine–coated
coverslips were left untreated (Co ) or treated with 10 nmol/L paclitaxel, patupilone, or sagopilone (Sag) for the indicated time, in the absence or presence of
50 Amol/L Z-VAD-fmk, followed by immunostaining for the detection of cytochrome c (Cyt c, green ) and active caspase-3 (Casp-3a, red ). Hoechst 33342
(emitting in blue ) was used for nuclear counterstaining. Representative images obtained in control conditions and upon sagopilone treatment are shown (scale bars,

left untreated or cultured with the indicated dose of sagopilone for 48 h, followed by cytofluorimetric quantification of viability (with propidium iodide, PI ) and

simultaneous presence of sagopilone and biotin-VAD.fmk (b-VAD, which traps apical caspases) for 48 h (Pretreat b-VAD ), or with sagopilone only for 42 h followed
by the addition of biotin-VADfmk during the last 6 h of treatment (Posttreat b-VAD ). Thereafter, biotinylated proteins were purified from cellular extracts and subjected
to immunoblotting with antibodies that recognize caspase-3 and caspase-9.

Figure 3. Sagopilone-induced mitochondrial apoptosis is modulated by a specific set of cell death regulators. A, human colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells previously
transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 24 h were left untreated or treated with 30 nmol/L sagopilone, 30 nmol/L paclitaxel, and 20 Amol/L cisplatin (CDDP ), followed
by viability assessment with a colorimetric assay. For each siRNA, columns report the assay-independent variable DWST-1 (defined in Supplementary Materials
and Methods), which represents the difference between the residual viability observed upon treatment in transfected cells and the residual viability obtained in cells
transfected with a control, scrambled siRNA (SCR ). Columns, mean; bars, SE. Gray and black columns, statistically significant (Student’s t test, P < 0.05) negative
and positive values of DWST-1, which in that order represent chemosensitization and cytoprotection toward chemotherapeutic agents. White columns, nonsignificant

colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells (C ); and HCT 116 cells stably transfected with an empty vector (pCMV ) or with a pCMV-based plasmid encoding the baculoviral
inhibitor of caspases p35 (D ) were treated with the indicated concentrations of sagopilone for 48 h. Thereafter, cells were stained with DiOC6(3) and propidium iodide
for the cytofluorimetric detection of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DW m) dissipation and plasma membrane rupture. White and
black columns, mean percentage of cells (n = 3) characterized by DW m loss alone (DW mlow) and in combination with plasma membrane breakdown (PI+), respectively;

only moderate effects on sagopilone-induced cell death. The
siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Chk1 (but not of Chk2)
sensitized cells to sagopilone-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A), a finding that could be recapitulated by the pharmacologic Chk1
inhibitor UCN-01 (Supplementary Fig. S4A–D). In an additional series of experiments, we determined the effect of the
genetic background on the clonogenic survival of human HCT
116 colon carcinoma cells treated with spindle poisons. Although
the absence of bax increased the relative resistance of these
cells to taxanes and epothilones, including sagopilone, by a factor
of 1.6 to 1.9 (P < 0.01, Student’s t test), the knockout of p53,
p21, chk2, or 14-3-3r had no effects, underscoring the importance
of Bax for the induction of apoptosis by microtubule-targeting
agents (Supplementary Table SII). In HCT 116 cells, p35 expression also conferred a moderate relative resistance, by a factor of
1.5 to 1.8.

A549-B480 is a clone of NSCLC A549 cells that has been selected
by continuous culture in the presence of patupilone (30). These
cells require the presence of 100 to 300 nmol/L patupilone for
survival because of a series of mutations that lead to amino acid
substitutions in class I h-tubulin (Gln292Glu and Val60Phe, in the
first and second allele, respectively) and Ka1-tubulin (Leu195Met;
ref. 30). Upon removal of patupilone, A549-B480 cells manifested a
sequence of alterations (metaphase arrest, abnormal metaphases
with monopolar and multipolar spindles, multinucleation, caspase3 activation, and apoptotic chromatin condensation; Fig. 4A and B)
that is strikingly similar to those observed in normal cells treated
with microtubule-stabilizing drugs (Fig. 2). This cell death was
partially suppressed by pharmacologic inhibition of caspases with
Z-VAD-fmk and by siRNA-mediated depletion of Bax and/or Bak,
and was enhanced following the depletion of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL
(Fig. 4C). The addition of sagopilone rescued A549-B480 cells from

Figure 4. Sagopilone prevents apoptosis induced by patupilone withdrawal
in A549-B480 cells. A and B, NSCLC A549-B480 cells were cultured on
L-polylysine–coated coverslips in the presence of 300 nmol/L patupilone, which
was then removed for the indicated recovery time. Thereafter, samples were
processed for immunofluorescence microscopy aimed at detecting h-tubulin
(green fluorescence) and active caspase-3 (Casp-3a, red fluorescence). Hoechst
33342 (emitting in blue) was used as nuclear counterstain. In A, representative
images for each time point are reported, focusing on abnormal mitoses and
multinucleated cells. In B, columns report the quantification of the mitotic index, as
well as of the percentage of cells characterized by multinucleation or caspase-3
activation (Casp-3a+). Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. *, statistical significance

transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 24 h, followed ( ) or not (+) by patupilone
withdrawal from the culture medium. After an additional 48 h, cells were subjected
to cytofluorimetric quantification of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
(DW m) and viability (with propidium iodide). D, A549-B480 cells were incubated
with the indicated doses of sagopilone alone ( ) or together with 300 nmol/L
patupilone (+) for 72 h, followed by cytofluorimetric assessment of apoptosisassociated variables as in C. In C and D, white and black columns depict the

patupilone withdrawal-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D), which points
to a large overlap between the mechanisms underlying the effects
of patupilone and sagopilone. Consistent with this interpretation,
1,000 nmol/L sagopilone alone as well as 100 to 1,000 nmol/L
sagopilone in association with 300 nmol/L patupilone were able to
overcome the resistance of A549-B480 cells (which are characterized by an IC50 for patupilone of 480 nmol/L; ref. 30) to microtubule
stabilizers, and provoked extensive cell death (Fig. 4D). Notably,
the dose of sagopilone (10 nmol/L) required to substitute for
patupilone (>100 nmol/L) was relatively low, further underscoring
its elevated pharmacologic potential (Fig. 4D).
The pharmacokinetic profile of sagopilone contributes to its
enhanced antitumor effect. Although sagopilone activates lethal
pathways similar to those triggered by other epothilones and
taxanes (Figs. 2–4), it incorporates more efficiently into cells (Fig. 1)
and hence acts at a lower IC50 than these compounds, when tested
on HCT 116 colon cancer cells (Supplementary Table SII). Similarly,
sagopilone showed an enhanced antitumor activity compared
with other epothilones in Adriamycin-resistant NCI/Adr cells,
which are well known for the overexpression of P-gp efflux systems
that confer a MDR phenotype (21). Inhibition of P-gp efflux pumps
by verapamil (31) enhanced the sensitivity of NCI/Adr cells to
patupilone; yet, it had no effect on the response of these cells to
sagopilone (Supplementary Fig. S6A). The uptake of radiolabeled
sagopilone and paclitaxel was evaluated in several cell lines,
including MDR1-overexpressing HeLa/MaTu/Adr cells (Supplementary Table SIII). Generally, the uptake of 3.5 nmol/L sagopilone
(range 5.9–11.8 pmol/106 cells) was higher than that of paclitaxel
(range 0.2–3.6 pmol/106 cells), and this difference was particularly
pronounced in HeLa/MaTu/Adr cells (5.9 pmol/106 cells for
sagopilone versus 0.2 pmol/106 cells for paclitaxel). Similar results
were observed when these agents were administered at a
concentration of 70 nmol/L. Notably, verapamil increased the
intracellular concentration of paclitaxel in Adriamycin-resistant
HeLa/MaTu/Adr cells more than 6-fold; yet, it did not influence the
intracellular concentration of radiolabeled sagopilone (Supplementary Table SIII), further demonstrating that sagopilone is not a
substrate of P-gp efflux pumps. The rapid cellular uptake of
sagopilone is consistent with its full antiproliferative effects on
tumor cells even after a short incubation period (2 hours versus
>72 hours for ixabepilone; Supplementary Fig. S5; refs. 32–35).
Broad anticancer activity of sagopilone in vitro and in vivo.
To evaluate the therapeutic range of sagopilone, its antiproliferative
activity was compared with that of other microtubule-targeting
agents on a panel of tumor cell lines. Sagopilone was more active
than paclitaxel and other epothilones (such as ixabepilone or epothilone D) in all cell models evaluated (Supplementary Fig. S6B),
including those that are intrinsically resistant to paclitaxel (e.g.,
Caco2 and HCT-15 colon cancer and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer
cells) and resistant to standard anticancer agents (e.g., HeLa/
MaTu/Adr and HeLa-RDB cervical cancer, HT-29-RDB colon
cancer, and EPG85-257P-RDB gastric cancer cells; Supplementary
Fig. S6B). As determined on a panel of 49 tumor cell lines, the mean
IC50 value of sagopilone was 0.64 nmol/L (range 0.3–1.8 nmol/L),
which is much lower than that previously determined for
ixabepilone (1.4–34.5 nmol/L) in 21 tumor models (36).
The range of activity shown by sagopilone in vitro was mirrored
in vivo across different human cancer xenograft models, including
those resistant to common antineoplastic agents like paclitaxel.
Sagopilone was efficient in the treatment of a variety of human
cancers growing in immunodeficient mice, as determined by

measuring treated versus control (T/C) ratios (the tumor area
of sagopilone-treated xenografts divided by that of untreated
xenografts; Table 1). As a T/C ratio <0.5 denotes significant efficacy,
results indicate that sagopilone was highly efficient against tumors
with a MDR phenotype, such as those derived by HeLa/MaTu/Adr
and A2780/AD10 cells. T/C ratios <0.5 were observed in a majority
of xenografts treated with sagopilone, including models of breast,
ovarian, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. For instance, sagopilone induced the regression of the ovarian cancer xenograft OvarCa-2 (Supplementary Fig. S6C) and strongly inhibited the growth
of xenografted NCI/Adr cells (Supplementary Fig. S6D). Sagopilone
also reduced tumor growth of the HCT 116 colon cancer xenograft,
which is intrinsically resistant to paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S6E).

Discussion
The antitumor activity of paclitaxel and epothilones is primarily due to mitotic arrest, followed by the induction of apoptosis
(1, 5, 11). The cytotoxicity produced by such agents generally
correlates with their ability to bind microtubules, stabilize mitotic
spindles, and induce the formation of interphase microtubule
bundles (14). Patupilone binds to tubulin at the same binding site
than paclitaxel, yet it induces more rapid generation of microtubule
bundles (13). The results presented here indicate that another epothilone (i.e., sagopilone) provokes an even more rapid and potent
tubulin polymerization than paclitaxel or patupilone. However, the
molecular pathways that link tubulin polymerization to mitotic
aberration and mitochondrial apoptosis after sagopilone treatment
seems substantially similar to that induced by paclitaxel and other
epothilones, with a major involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins.
Two features of sagopilone may explain why this molecule consistently acts at a lower IC50 than other microtubule-polymerizing
agents and why different tumor cell lines exhibit a strong and only
moderately variable sensitivity in response to sagopilone. First,
sagopilone is more efficient than other microtubule poisons in
inducing tubulin polymerization in vitro, reflecting an enhanced
intrinsic activity of the molecule compared with similar agents. In

addition, sagopilone exhibits favorable pharmacodynamic properties because it is rapidly taken up by cells and is not recognized by
P-gp efflux pumps. The range of activity shown by sagopilone in vitro
correlates with its efficacy against several human cancer xenograft
models, including those resistant to common antineoplastic agents.
The experiments reported here and elsewhere (21) also indicate that
sagopilone is well tolerated in animal models, with a moderate initial
weight reduction followed by prompt recovery. This is in contrast to
the substantial toxicity previously described for patupilone (12, 17).
Sagopilone exerts potent antineoplastic activities across a wide
spectrum of tumor models in vitro, at much lower concentrations
than other epothilones, and in vivo with favorable tolerability.
Irrespective of the molecular pathways activated by sagopilone,
which are partially shared with other microtubule poisons, the
clinical application of this novel epothilone might take significant
advantages of its pharmacodynamic profile. In clinical settings, this
might allow for the use of lower doses compared with those used for
classic microtubule stabilizers (and notably for paclitaxel, which is
routinely used to treat several human malignancies but is associated with neutropenia, weakness, infection, and allergic reactions;
ref. 37), thus reducing the incidence and severity of side effects.
These preclinical results provide a sound basis for examining
sagopilone in various clinical settings. In phase I trials, sagopilone
has already shown favorable bioavailability, antitumor activity, and
good tolerability in heavily pretreated patients (38). Based on these
promising results, sagopilone is currently being evaluated in a
broad phase II program enrolling patients with a wide range of
tumors, including glioblastomas and ovarian, prostate, lung, and
breast cancers (39). Thus, our preclinical data signal a considerable
potential for sagopilone.
