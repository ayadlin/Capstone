ABSTRACT
The discovery of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations in Non
Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) launched the era of personalized medicine in advanced
NSCLC, leading to a dramatic shift in the therapeutic landscape of this disease. After
ten years from the individuation of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain
of the EGFR in NSCLC patients responding to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
Gefitinib, several progresses have been done and first line treatment with EGFR TKIs
is a firmly established option in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. During the
last decade, different EGFR TKIs have been developed and three inhibitors have been
approved so far in these selected patients. However, despite great breakthroughs have
been made, treatment of these molecularly selected patients poses novel therapeutic
challenges, such as emerging of acquired resistance, brain metastases development
or the need to translate these treatments in earlier clinical settings, such as adjuvant
therapy.
The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the major
progresses reported so far in the EGFR inhibition in this molecularly-selected subgroup
of NSCLC patients, from the early successes with first generation EGFR TKIs, Erlotinib
and Gefitinib, to the novel irreversible and mutant-selective inhibitors and ultimately
the emerging challenges that we, in the next future, are called to deal with.

INTRODUCTION
The discovery of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) mutations in NSCLC launched the era
of personalized medicine in advanced Non Small Cell
Lung Cancer (NSCLC), leading to a dramatic shift in
the therapeutic landscape of this disease from a “one size
fits all” approach to the treatment selection on molecular
characteristics of tumors [1, 2]. After ten years from the
individuation of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain of the EGFR in NSCLC patients responding to the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) Gefitinib, several
progresses have been done and first line treatment with
EGFR TKIs is a firmly established option in advanced
EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. During the last decade,

together constitute ~80–90% of all EGFR mutations
in NSCLC. These mutations are commonly referred as
“activating mutations” as they are constitutive activated
and oncogenic. These mutant kinases present a reduced
affinity for the ATP, accounting for the increased
sensitivity to EGFR TKIs compared with the wild type
counterparts, since these inhibitors compete with ATP for
binding to the catalytic site [10–12].
With the exception of PI3KCA mutations [13],
the majority of oncogenic drivers in NSCLC are usually
mutually exclusive, including EGFR mutations.
Some authors have suggested a differential
sensitivity to EGFR TKIs for exon 19 deletions and exon
21 L858R point mutations, with the former associated
with longer overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS) [14, 15]. These preliminary observations
were confirmed in clinical trials [16–18], although
others have did not find any correlation [19, 20]. Recent
meta-analyses addressed this question and reported that
patients harboring exon 19 deletions are associated with
a reduced progression risk than those with exon 21 point
mutations [21–23] and a longer OS [22, 23]. However,
the exact mechanism of this association remains largely
elusive and might involve differential sensitivity to
EGFR TKIs, different mechanism of acquired resistance
as well as different frequency of compound mutations
[21]. These data have important clinical consequences
since stratification for the type of EGFR mutation might
represent an important factor to consider in clinical trials
with EGFR TKIs.
Oncogene addicted tumors, such as EGFR mutated
NSCLCs, may present peculiar patterns of metastatization
compared with wild type tumors, including a more
frequent liver involvement at the diagnosis [24], higher
tendency to central nervous system metastatization
[25–27] and higher likelihood of brain metastases
detection at first presentation [28] diffuse and/or miliary

The discovery of EGFR mutations
The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
is a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor that is activated upon
binding to the Epidermal Growth Factor and other growth
factor ligands, triggering several downstream pathways,
including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and STAT that regulate
different cellular processes, including DNA synthesis and
proliferation. EGFR signaling is commonly deregulated
in cancer through different mechanisms, including
genetic mutations of the receptor [2, 3]. Mutant forms of
EGFR have different trafficking compared with the wild
type receptor, since some of the regulatory proteins that
balance the EGFR pathway present altered expression in
cancer [4].
In 2004 two different groups simultaneously
identified the presence of somatic mutations in the tyrosine
kinase domain of the EGFR in a small group of patients
with NSCLC responding to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) Gefitinib [5, 6]. These somatic mutations
were associated with in vitro sensitivity to Gefitinib
and with clinic-pathological characteristics preliminary
associated with clinical activity [7, 8]: Asian ethnicity,
female sex, adenocarcinoma histology and never smoking
status. In addition, EGFR mutations were also associated
with TTF-1 expression [9]. These somatic mutations
mainly target the exons 18–21 of the gene, which encodes
part of the TK domain of the EGFR (encoded by exons
18–24) and are clustered around the ATP-binding pocket
of the receptor. The most common and best characterized
EGFR mutations are in-frame deletions in exon 19, which
eliminates the conserved motif LREA (residues
747–750), and the exon 21 L858R substitutions, that

pulmonary metastases [28, 29]. However, others did
not find any differences in brain and bone metastases
development between EGFR-mutated patients and
wild type [30] or significant differences in number,
neuroanatomic location or size of brain metastases [31].
Moreover, some authors have suggested a possible
interaction between EGFR mutation type and site of
metastatization. For instance, Sekine et al. reported that
patients harboring exon 19 deletions present a peculiar
pattern of brain metastatization that resemble to that of
miliary brain metastases, with multiple and small brain
tumors with minimal peritumoral edema [32].
In addition to classic “common mutations” ~10%
of patients with EGFR mutations may ehibit mutations
in codons other than 19 and 21. Rare mutations could be
detected in a small fraction of patients including exon
18 mutations, predominantly at G719 (~3–4%), exon
20 mutations (~4–5%) as well as uncommon mutations
in exon 19 (for example, in-frame insertions) and 21
(i.e. L851Q/R), and finally compound mutations. The
clinical significance of these rare mutants is not always
fully understood with some variants associated with

response to EGFR TKIs (for instance, exon 18 G719X)
other associated with resistance (i.e. exon 20 T790M) and
other with uncertain clinical significance [33–35]. The
mechanism by which these mutations confer resistance to
EGFR TKIs is not always fully understood, but a better
knowledge of the molecular basis of their activity may
help to overcome resistance in patients harboring these
mutations [36].
The presence of EGFR mutations defines a specific
molecular subgroup of NSCLC (~15% of Caucasian
patients with adenocarcinomas) [37, 38] that respond to an
EGFR TKI in over 60% of patients (Table 1). The role of
these inhibitors in EGFR wild type tumors is instead more
debatable, since the benefit in such patient is modest (~8%
with Erlotinib in pretreated NSCLC) and no predictive
biomarkers have been so far reported in this specific subset
of patients [39].
Several phase III trials demonstrated the
superiority of EGFR TKIs over chemotherapy in
EGFR-mutated NSCLC in the first line setting in terms
of overall response rate (ORR) and progression free
survival (PFS), but not in overall survival (OS) due

EGFR inhibition in EGFR-addicted NSCLC:
A successful 10-year story

to the extensive cross-over between treatment arms,
although recently a pooled analysis of patients harboring
common mutations enrolled in the LUX-Lung-3 and -6
trials reported a survival advantage also [18]. Since no
survival gain was demonstrated in the phase III trials
conducted so far, the use of EGFR TKIs in EGFRmutated patients in first- or second-line should not
influence the eventual survival outcome, as demonstrated
in the phase II trial of the Spanish Lung Cancer Group
[40]. However, retrospective analyses of large phase III
trials reported inferior ORR than commonly observed in
the front-line setting in EGFR-mutated patients treated
with EGFR TKIs after chemotherapy [41–44]. A possible
explanation might come from studies that reported an
influence of chemotherapy on EGFR mutation status,
with lower mutational rate in patients previously
treated with chemotherapy [45, 46]. Chemotherapy may
selectively kill and inhibit mutant clones within the
tumor, whereas wild type clones may proliferate, altering
the relative proportion of EGFR-mutated/EGFR-wild
type cells within the tumor mass. A direct observation
of increased sensitivity to chemotherapy is the fact that
patients with EGFR mutations usually exhibit increased
ORR to first-line chemotherapy [47]. These studies
underlie another emerging problem, the presence of
tumor heterogeneity.
In 2012 in a seminal paper Gerlinger and coll.
reported evidence of intratumor heterogeneity and
spatial separation of subclones in metastatic renal cancer,
establishing the “branched evolution” hypothesis [48],
suggesting that biomarker sampling in a single tumor
region may undetect the complex genomic landscape
of a tumor, providing major challenges to clinical
implementation of personalized medicine and biomarker
development. Two recent papers addressed this issue
in NSCLC also. De Bruin et al. reported spatial and
temporal tumor heterogeneity of driver mutations within
NSCLC, raising the possibility that a single-region
sampling biopsy, as commonly done in clinical practice,
could miss clinical-relevant driver events present in
specific tumor subclones [49]. In contrast, Zhang et al.
did not found substantial differences within the same
tumor in driver mutations, suggesting that single-biopsy
analysis might be sufficient to identify the majority
of known driver mutations in lung adenocarcinomas
[50]. In addition, a high concordance rate for recurrent
somatic alterations has been reported between primary
NSCLC and metastases, suggesting that a new biopsy for
genomic information to guide treatment decision may not
necessary when it is present an archived primary material,
since key driver oncogenic events seems to occur early in
NSCLC tumorigenesis [51].
Further studies are required to throw a light on
this controversial issue and therefore use of a singlesite biopsy should continue to be the standard in clinical
practice.

The clinical development of EGFR inhibitors in
NSCLC started before the discovery of EGFR mutations,
therefore initial studies with Gefitinib and Erlotinib
were conducted in unselected patients in both pretreated
[52–54] and in treatment-naïve patients in combination
with standard chemotherapy [55–58]. In attempt to
identify patients with improved outcome when treated
with EGFR TKIs, several predictive biomarkers, such
as EGFR overexpression/amplification [59] and HER2
overexpression/amplification [60], were studied before
EGFR mutations emerged as the major predictive factor
to these targeted agents. The discovery of EGFR mutations
and the dramatic responses observed with EGFR TKIs
in retrospective and small phase II studies [20, 61, 62]
paved the way to a paradigm shift in the clinical trial
design, favoring the development of clinically and then
molecularly selected studies in NSCLC. Gefitinib was
the first EGFR TKI receiving regulatory approval for
EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients after the publication of
the results of the IPASS (Iressa Pan-Asia Study) trial,
reporting a significant advantage in terms of PFS and
ORR for first-line Gefitinib versus Carboplatin/Paclitaxel
[63]. Several other trials conducted in Asia confirmed
the superiority of Gefitinib over chemotherapy in EGFRmutated patients [16, 44, 64].
The extension of approval of Erlotinib for patients
harboring EGFR mutations, in addition to the previous
indication for unselected patients with NSCLC after at
least one chemotherapeutic line, was obtained after the
publication of two large phase III trials conducted in Asia
[65] and Europe [66], providing the definitive demonstration
of superiority of an EGFR TKI over standard first-line
chemotherapy in molecularly selected patients.
Unfortunately, despite initial responses, virtually all
patients, ultimately, progress because of the acquisition of
resistance. In addition, a proportion of patients with EGFR
mutations exhibits de novo resistance and does not respond
to TKIs treatment. Several mechanisms of primary and
acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs [67, 68] have been so
far reported in in vitro NSCLC models and some have also
been confirmed in patients. Some of these mechanisms seem
to be mutually exclusive, although distinct mechanisms of
resistance may be operative in the same tumors [69, 70].
Several strategies have been developed for overcoming
acquired resistance to the EGFR TKIs [71, 72] and the
use of irreversible, covalent-binding, EGFR TKIs (the so
called “second generation” inhibitors) has been historically
one of the most extensively studied. Despite promising
preclinical evidences of activity against EGFR-mutated
cell lines harboring the gatekeeper T790M mutation [73–
75] the most frequent mechanism of acquired resistance
(~50–60% after rebiopsy) [69, 70], neither Afatinib [76]
nor Neratinib [77] nor Dacomitinib [78] demonstrated
26817

significant activity as single agent in patients harboring the
T790M mutations. The failure of this strategy is probably
due to the high drug concentrations required for reverting
acquired resistance that are not achievable in clinical
practice because of inacceptable toxicity, due to the activity
of these agents against wild type EGFR. Instead, their role is
more defined in the front-line treatment of NSCLC patients
harboring EGFR activating mutations. Recently, Afatinib
received regulatory approval in the first line setting after
the publication of the LUX-Lung-3 and -6 trials [79, 80]
and another irreversible EGFR inhibitor, Dacomitinib, has
reported promising results in a phase II study [81]. Ongoing
comparative phase III trials (ARCHER 1050, LUX-Lung-7)
will provide definitive evidences whether these agents are
superior than first-generation EGFR TKIs (i.e. Gefitinib and
Erlotinib) in this clinical setting.
However, the role of second generation EGFR
TKIs in acquired resistance is not definitely thrown over,
since combining these agents with other targeted agents,
such as the dual combination Afatinib plus Cetuxumab
[82] and Neratinib plus Temsirolimus [83], has recently
reported promising results, albeit toxicity profile of these
combinations could limit their clinical implementation.
The SWOG 1403 study is ongoing and will evaluate
Cetuximab-Afatinib combination in the first-line setting
in patients harboring EGFR sensitizing mutations.
In attempt to overcome the limits of secondgeneration EGFR inhibitors, a novel class of mutantselective inhibitors has been developed. The first in class
third generation inhibitor, named WZ4002, was discovered
in 2009 [84], through a functional pharmacological screens
against T790M mutant kinases. Unlike other EGFR TKIs
that possess a structurally related quinazoline-based core
scaffold and were identified as ATP-competitive inhibitors
of wild type EGFR, WZ4002 is a covalent pyrimidine
EGFR inhibitor specifically designed against EGFR T790M
that is 30–100 fold more potent against EGFR T790M, and
up to 100 fold less potent against wild type EGFR than
quinazoline based EGFR inhibitors in vitro and is effective
in murine models of lung cancer driven by EGFR T790M
[84]. WZ4002 did not progress into human clinical trials,
but three different mutant-selective irreversible inhibitors
(Rociletinib, AZD9291 and HM61713) have recently
reported in vivo impressive activity in patients with acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs. Rociletinib (also known as CO1686) is structurally related to WZ4002 and is the first
drug of its class in clinical development for the treatment
of T790M-positive NSCLC. In vitro and in vivo studies
demonstrated that Rociletinib irreversibly and selectively
inhibits mutant EGFR, including T790M mutation, with
minimal activity against wild type EGFR, suggesting
that drug tolerability to this agent may be superior to first
and second generation EGFR inhibitors, for which major
toxicities (diarrhea, skin rash and interstitial lung disease)
are attributed to wild type EGFR blockage. Interestingly,
NSCLC cells resistant to Rociletinib do not exhibit
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

secondary mutations of the EGFR or amplification of the
EGFR gene, but increased expression of genes involved
in the epithelial-mesenchimal transtition (EMT) and Akt
pathway [85]. Recently, Sequist and coll. reported the
preliminary results of the ongoing phase I/II study TIGER
X in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations
and T790M-positive that previously received an EGFR
TKI. The results, albeit preliminary, are quite impressive
with a 59% ORR and a median PFS not yet reached, but
exceeding 12 months. The safety profile of this agent is
also interesting with the most common toxicity represented
by hyperglycemia [86]. The expansion phase II cohort of
the study is ongoing and three trials (TIGER 1–3) will
be launched in different clinical settings. Another third
generation EGFR inhibitor is AZD9291. This monoanilinopyrimidine compound is structurally distinct from other
third generation EGFR TKIs and in preclinical studies
potently inhibited signaling pathways and cellular growth
in both EGFR-mutant and T790M-mutant cell lines in
vitro, with lower activity against wild type EGFR lines,
with profound and sustained tumor regression in EGFR
mutant tumor xenograft and transgenic models [87]. In
vitro data suggests the potential to target both HER2 and
HER4 kinase activity, a property that may be important
as HER2 amplification may mediate acquired resistance
to EGFR TKI in 5–12% of cases [70, 88]. AZD9291 also
appears to be effective against other rare drug-sensitive
EGFR mutants with low activity against EGFR exon 20
insertions [83]. AZD9291 demonstrated promising activity
in a phase I study in patients with EGFR-TKI resistant
NSCLC with an ORR of 51% and an impressive ORR of
62% in patients T790M-positive, with no dose-limiting
toxicities and a maximum tolerated dose not defined [89].
Three ongoing trials are evaluating the activity of AZD9291
in T790M-positive NSCLC (AURA 1–3 trials). Based on
these impressive preliminary results the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) granted the breakthrough
designation to both Rociletinib and AZD9291 for patients
EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC progressing during an
FDA-approved EGFR-TKI.
Preliminary results of a dose-escalating phase
I study evaluating a third mutant-selective inhibitor,
HM61713, has been recently presented. This inhibitor
was well tolerated and reported a promising activity in
EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients previously treated with
an EGFR-TKI with a more prominent activity in T790Mpositive tumors (ORR 29.2%, DCR 75.0%) than T790Mnegative (ORR 11.8%, DCR 55.9%) [90]. The expansion
part of the study is planned.

Emerging challenges
Brain metastases
The emergence of brain metastases (BM) represent
a major issue in clinical practice and is associated with

a dismal prognosis. Traditionally, systemic treatments
were considered mostly ineffective on BMs, with RR of
23–50% with platinum-based combinations [91]. The low
molecular weight, the good toxicity profile and the
unprecedented RR and PFS observed make appealing the
use of EGFR TKIs in patients harboring EGFR mutations
with BMs. Retrospective studies and small phase II trials
reported intriguing activity for EGFR TKIs in EGFRmutated patients with BMs, with RR ranging from 60%
to 100% and complete response (CR) rates that ranges
40% [91, 92]. Therefore front-line use of EGFR TKIs
in patients with asymptomatic BMs harboring EGFR
mutations could be the preferable option in this setting,
delaying the use of whole brain radiotherapy [93].
However, the degree of Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)
penetration of EGFR TKI may be influenced by factors
patients, such as the extent of central nervous (CNS)
disease and prior CNS-directed therapies, explaining
why the CNS may still act as a partial sanctuary site,
with approximately 20% of patients with EGFR-mutant
tumors developing BMs while on EGFR TKI therapy [94].
Different strategies have been hypothesized to overcome
this inadequate drug exposure, such as high pulsatile dose
of EGFR TKI [95] or, in case of oligoprogressive disease,
use of TKI beyond progression with the addition of local
ablative therapies [96, 97].
The recent results, albeit preliminary, with third
generation EGFR inhibitors with responses seen even
in the CNS are encouraging [86] and deserve further
investigations.

powerful effect on the study results [98]. The results of
the RADIANT trial were recently reported. In this study
973 patients with resected stage IB-IIIA NSCLC were
randomized to either Erlotinib 150 mg/d or placebo for
2 years with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. The
study failed to demonstrate a DFS advantage in the
overall population (50.5 months vs. 48.2 months), but a
trend toward a longer DFS was observed in the subgroup
of patients with EGFR mutation (16.5%), albeit not
statistically significant (46.4 months vs. 28.5 months) (HR
0.61, 95% CI 0.38–0.98, p = 0.039) [100, 101]. Moreover,
a retrospective study of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center reported a significant reduction of risk
of recurrence or death (HR 0.43, p = 0.001) and a trend
toward improved OS (HR 0.50, p = 0.076) for patients
with resected NSCLC treated with Erlotinib or Gefitinib
with or without adjuvant chemotherapy [102].
Ongoing studies in resected EGFR-mutated
NSCLC (NCT01405079; NCT01410214; WJOG6410L;
NCI-2014–01508) will definitely provide evidence
of efficacy of this strategy, as observed in other solid
malignancies, such as Imatinib in GIST and Trastuzumab
in HER2-positive Breast Cancer.
Uncommon and resistance EGFR mutations
Exon 19 in-frame deletions and point-mutation
L858R of the exon 21 account for more than 90% of all
EGFR mutations and are associated with sensitivity to
EGFR TKIs.
However, efficacy data for the remaining ~10% of
EGFR mutations are lacking and mostly from retrospective
analyses [34, 103]. Data from the LUX-Lung project were
recently presented, showing the activity of Afatinib in the
largest prospective dataset in patients with rare mutations.
The picture emerging from this analysis is complex
with high heterogeneity among this peculiar molecular
subgroup. Patients with de novo T790M mutations or exon
20 insertions presented in general inferior ORR and shorter
PFS and OS compared with patients harboring other
uncommon mutations, such as exon 18 G719X and exon
21 L861Q, that exhibited a range of sensitivity similar to
that of common mutations. However, in some cases with
exon 20 insertions or T790M mutations durable control
of the tumor was observed [104]. Data from the French
ERMETIC-IFCT network reported similar findings, with
poorer outcome for patients harboring exon 20 insertions,
with the exception of more proximal mutations, compared
with complex mutations and exon 18 mutations [105].
A more extensive comprehension of the mechanisms
underlying EGFR TKI-sensitivity of these mutations
should help to provide more effective strategies for patients
harboring these rare mutants. Recently, Yasuda et al.
described the chemical structure of the exon 20 mutations
D770_N771insNPG, showing that the three amino-acid
insertion forms a “wedge” that lock the C helix of the
EGFR in its inward, active position. Therefore, the clinical

Translating the results from advanced setting to
adjuvant therapy
The use of EGFR TKIs is the standard of care in
advanced/metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR
mutations, however their role in early-stage lung cancer
is far less defined. Two large randomized trials evaluated
the role of EGFR TKIs in unselected resected stage IBIIIA NSCLC. The BR.19 study started in 2002 when
adjuvant chemotherapy was not considered standard of
care in resected NSCLC. Therefore, in 2003 the study was
amended to allow adjuvant chemotherapy, so only 17% of
patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 5% adjuvant
radiotherapy. The BR.19 randomized patients to receive
Gefitinib 250 mg/d versus Placebo for 2 years [98]. After
the publication of the dismal results of the SWOG S0023
trial [99], that reported a detrimental effect for Gefitinib
maintenance after definitive chemo-radiotherapy the
BR.19 study was prematurely closed. The results of the
study demonstrated not only no an advantage in both DFS
and OS in the overall population and in the small subgroup
of EGFR-mutated patients (4%), but also a possible
detrimental effect.
The detrimental effect observed even in EGFRmutated patients may be attributable to the low mutation
rate observed in the study, that could not have a sufficient

resistance of this mutant is not due to steric hindrance
with inhibitor binding, but simply not sensitizing to EGFR
TKIs inhibition [36]. These findings may help through the
screening of compound libraries identification of mutantselective inhibitors as with T790M-mutants. Moreover, it
was demonstrated that exon 20 mutations (EGFR D770_
P772del_insKG and D770 > GY), which are intrinsically
associated with resistance to EGFR TKIs, activate EGFR by
increasing the attractive electrostatic dimerization energies.
This might provide the rationale for the use of anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies in patients with such mutations,
since cetuximab, by preventing receptor dimerization, may
be associated with therapeutic activity [106].

cancer: a randomized trial. JAMA. 2003; 290:2149–58.

Since the discovery of EGFR mutations in 2004,
the therapeutic landscape of advanced NSCLC has
dramatically changed with unprecedented results in this
usually disappointing disease. However, the clinical
success of this strategy is limited by several challenges
with which we are called to deal, such as emergence of
acquired resistance or treatment of rare and compound
mutations. To date three different EGFR TKIs have been
approved and no prospective data are available to guide
optimal treatment selection in clinical practice. Ongoing
comparative randomized studies between reversible and
irreversible EGFR TKIs and the recent development of
novel mutant-selective inhibitors in patients with acquired
resistance will definitely provide definitive conclusions
about the optimal therapeutic strategy in this molecularly
selected subgroup of patients. Probably, there is no
magic bullet that can cure cancer by blocking a single
signaling pathway, however combining these inhibitors
each other or with other no overlapping drugs and a better
comprehension of inherited mechanisms of resistance
to these targeted agents might provide more durable
therapeutic successes with the hope, in a not so far future,
to cure lung cancer.
