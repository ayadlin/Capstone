BACKGROUND. The human nuclear export protein chromosomal region maintenance/exportin 1/Xpo1 (CRM1) mediates the nuclear export of proteins and messenger RNAs and, thus, is an important regulator of subcellular distribution of
key molecules. Whereas cell-biologic studies have suggested a fundamental role

for CRM1 in the regulation of mitosis, the expression of this protein in human
tumor tissue has not been investigated to date.

METHODS. In this study, the expression of CRM1 was analyzed in a cohort of
88 ovarian tumors and 12 ovarian cell lines for the first time to the authors’
knowledge.

RESULTS. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased nuclear (52.7%) and cytoplasmic (56.8%) expression of CRM1 in 74 carcinomas compared with the expression revealed in borderline tumors and benign lesions. Similarly, CRM1
expression was increased in ovarian cancer cell lines compared with human ovarian surface epithelial cells. Cytoplasmic CRM1 expression was related significantly to advanced tumor stage (P 5 .043), poorly differentiated carcinomas
(P 5 .011), and higher mitotic rate (P 5 .008). Nuclear CRM1 was associated significantly with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression (P 5 .002) and poor overall
survival (P 5 .01). Because it was demonstrated previously that blocking of CRM1
by leptomycin B (LMB) contributes to the inhibition of nuclear export, the
authors used a set of mechanistic assays to study the effects of CRM1 inhibition
in cancer cells. Treatment of OVCAR-3 cells with LMB revealed a significant
reduction of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis as well as suppressed
interleukin-1b-induced COX-2 expression.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that CRM1 is expressed in a subpopulation of ovarian carcinomas with aggressive behavior and is related to poor
patient outcome. A correlation also was demonstrated between CRM1 and COX-2
expression in ovarian cancer tissue. Furthermore, the treatment of ovarian cancer
cells with LMB revealed a reduction in COX-2 expression. Therefore, the authors
suggest that CRM1 may be an interesting biomarker for the assessment of patient
prognosis and a molecular target for anticancer treatment. Cancer 2008;112:

60% of patients who have stage III/IV tumors have a
5-year survival rate of only 28%. The main prognostic factors for the planning of therapy are International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) stage and residual tumor at surgery. Other
factors, such as patient age, tumor grade, and histologic tumor type, have some additional prognostic
impact. The identification of further molecularly
defined prognostic parameters, particularly for
patients with advanced disease, would be very helpful
for planning and individualization of treatment.
Furthermore, investigation of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to tumor progression will be
relevant for the identification of new therapeutic
strategies.
The coordinated transport of proteins and
nucleic acids across the nuclear envelope between nucleus and cytoplasm is essential for cellular integrity
and gene expression. This transport is mediated by
soluble transport factors, the karyopherins, which interact with their transport cargos through nuclear localization sequences and nuclear export sequences (NES),
which regulate entry into and exit from the nucleus.
Chromosomal region maintenance/exportin 1/
Xpo1 (CRM1) originally was identified in the fission
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a genetic screen,
and investigators determined that it was involved in
control of the chromosome structure.3 Several studies have demonstrated that CRM1 is important in at
least 2 areas of cellular functions: nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and control of mitosis. Regarding the
transport function, CRM1 is the main nuclear export
receptor in humans. This transporter has a comparably broad substrate range and mediates the export
of leucine-rich NES-bearing proteins and the transfer
of messenger RNAs (mRNAs).4–8 Mechanistic studies
have demonstrated an increasing number of NEScontaining signaling molecules that depend on the
CRM1 nuclear export pathway, p53,9 histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5),10 protein kinase 1 (Akt1),11 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),12 and others.13,14
Therefore, this shuttling process controls several elements of pathways that have been identified as important in tumor biology.
It also has been demonstrated that CRM1 functions in complex with ras-related nuclear proteinguaosine triphosphatase (RAN-GTPase) to control
several processes during cellular mitosis. Thus,
CRM1 associates with kinetochores as well as centromeres during mitosis. In particular, this controls
chromosome segregation15 and prevents chromosome reduplication.16
CRM1 has been identified in biochemical studies
as the specific target molecule of leptomycin B

(LMB),17 an unsaturated, branched-chain fatty acid
with a terminal d-lactone ring that binds covalently
to cysteine 529 in the NES binding region of human
CRM1.18 LMB was discovered primarily as an antifungal agent and has demonstrated antiproliferative
properties as well as in vivo antitumor activity. Blocking of CRM1 contributes to the inhibition of cargo
loading and subsequent nuclear export.3 It is noteworthy that LMB inhibited the stabilization of COX-2
mRNA in human mammary cancer cells and suppressed interleukin 1b (IL-1b)-induced COX-2 expression in a human colon cancer cell line.8
With this cell-biologic background in mind, we
have developed the hypothesis that CRM1 plays an
important role in the regulation of cellular functions
that are involved in the development and progression
of human tumors. In this study, for the first time to
our knowledge, we analyzed the CRM1 expression in
a cohort of primary human ovarian carcinomas and
compared expression data with clinicopathologic
characteristics, COX-2 expression, and patient survival. We determined the expression of CRM1 in
ovarian cancer cell lines and treated cells with LMB,
which is a specific CRM1 antagonist.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Tissue Samples
Immunohistochemical examination of CRM1 was
performed retrospectively on tissue samples that
were taken for routine diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes. Normal ovarian tissues and benign and
malignant ovarian tumors from 98 patients who were
diagnosed at the Institute of Pathology, Charité Hospital Berlin between 1989 and 2003 were included in
the study. The tissue specimens consisted of 74 primary invasive ovarian carcinomas, 14 borderline
tumors, and 3 cystadenomas as well as 7 normal
ovaries. Tissue samples were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Routine hematoxylin and eosin sections were stained for
histopathologic evaluation. The stage of tumors was
assessed according to the FIGO staging system. For
grading of tumors, the Silverberg grading system,
which is composed of architectural, nuclear, and
mitotic features, was used.19 The number of mitoses
per 10 high-power fields (HPF) was evaluated and
separated into 3 groups, <9 of 10 HPF, 10 to 23 of 10
HPF, and >24 of 10 HPF. For statistical evaluation
and survival analysis, only the patients with invasive
ovarian carcinomas were included. Data on intraoperative residual tumor were available for 50 patients
with FIGO stage II through IV disease. Of these, 30
patients (60%) had no residual tumor, 14 patients

CRM1 Expression in Ovarian Cancer/Noske et al.

(28%) had postoperative residual tumor that
measured <20 mm, and 6 patients (12%) postoperative residual tumor that measured >20 mm. Lymphadenectomy was undergone by 81.1% of patients.
Most of patients (18.9%) who did not undergo
lymphadenectomy had high-stage disease with
known peritoneal or distant metastasis. Data regarding postoperative chemotherapy were known for 68
patients; of these, 62 patients (91.2%) received a platinum-based therapy, 2 patients (2.9%) received other
nonplatinum regimens, and 4 patients (5.9%) did not
receive any chemotherapy. The median follow-up for
all patients was 39 months.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical examination was performed
on tissue microarrays. Therefore, representative areas
of the ovarian carcinomas as well as borderline
tumors were marked on the routine hematoxylin and
eosin-stained histologic sections. Four tissue cores
that measured 1.5 mm in greatest dimension from
different tumor parts of the donor blocks were
punched by using a tissue microarrayer (Beecher
Instruments, Woodland, Wis) and positioned in a recipient paraffin array block.
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, slides were
boiled in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker
for 5 minutes and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-CRM1 antibody (sc5595; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif; 1:100 dilution)
overnight at 4 8C. This was followed by incubation
with a biotinylated antimouse secondary antibody
and the multilink biotin-streptavidin-amplified detection system (Biogenex, San Ramon, Calif). Staining was visualized by using a Fast Red chromogen
system (Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany). The intensity of the CRM1 immunostaining in tumor cells
was evaluated independently by 2 pathologists (A.N.
and C.D.) who were blinded to patient outcomes. In
the event of disagreement, the cases were discussed
at a multihead microscope. CRM1 expression was
evaluated according to the percentage of positive
cells and the intensity of staining. We analyzed a
complete tumor area of 4 tissue cores (each 1.5 in
greatest dimension), approximately 20 HPF. For
assessing the percentage of CRM1-expressing cells,
the area that contained positive cells was compared
with the whole area that was covered by tumor cells.
Staining intensity was estimated by comparison with
normal ovarian tissue on standard paraffin sections.
In addition, a separate scoring for nuclear and cytoplasmic CRM1 expression was performed. The percentage of positive cells was scored as 0 (0%),

1735

1 (<10%), 2 (11%–50%), 3 (51%–80%), or 4 (>80%);
and the staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative),
1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong). For the immunoreactive score (IRS), the percentage of positive
cells and the staining intensity were multiplied,
resulting in a value between 0 and 12. To separate
samples with weak or strong expression of CRM1 in
tumor tissue, we combined samples that had an IRS
from 0 to 6 into 1 group with negative to weak
expression (CRM1-negative) and samples that had
an IRS from 7 to 12 into another group that was
considered CRM1-positive. The minimum requirements for a sample to be scored as positive were either moderate expression in >80% of cells or strong
expression in >50% of cells. Normal tissue and benign lesions of the ovary served as negative controls.
Expression of COX-2 was determined as described
previously20 by using the monoclonal COX-2 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
Mich).

Statistical Analysis
The statistical significance of the association between
CRM1 and COX-2 expression and clinicopathologic
parameters was assessed by using the chi-square test
for trends or the Fisher exact test. The probability of
overall survival as a function of time was determined
by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in
survival curves were compared by using the log-rank
test. Multivariate survival analysis was performed by
using the Cox model of proportional hazards. P
values <.05 were considered significant. For statistical evaluations, the SPSS software version 13.0 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, Ill) was used.
Cell Culture and Inhibitors
The human ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVCAR-3,
SKOV-3, CAOV-3, ES-2, A2780, Mdah2744, and
OAW42) that were investigated in this study have
been described previously.21,22 EFO21, EFO27, and
FU-OV-1 were obtained from the German Collection
of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Heidelberg, Germany); and PA-1 cells, a human ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line, was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md).
Cells were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (Bio Whittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA
Laboratories, Linz, Austria). Human ovarian surface
epithelial (HOSE) cells,23 an immortalized human
ovarian surface epithelium cell line, were cultivated
in a 1:1 mixture of medium 199 (Sigma Chemical
Company, St. Louis, Mo) and moisture content, dry
basis medium 105 (MCDB 105; Life Technologies,

1736

Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum and 2 mM glutamine. All cell lines were
maintained at 37 8C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% carbon dioxide/95% air. In some experiments
COX-2 expression was induced with recombinant
human IL-1b (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn) for 24 hours.20
The following inhibitory agents were used: the
inhibitor LMB (L2913; Sigma Chemical Company),
which has demonstrated the ability to inhibit CRM1
in other cellular systems at different concentrations
(2.5 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 10 ng/mL) for a maximum
of 72 hours. Because COX-2 expression may be associated with other tumor signaling pathways, we also
used inhibitors of 2 important pathways, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002
(10 mM) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase
inhibitor PD98059 (50 mM), to examine any effect of
these pathways on COX-2 expression. Both inhibitors
were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany).24

Cell Cycle Analysis
OVCAR-3 cells were plated at 4 3 105 cells per well
in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, cells were treated
with LMB at concentrations of 2.5 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL,
and 10 ng/mL for 48 hours. Next, cells were fixed in
70% ice-cold ethanol at 220 8C for 30 minutes. The
percentages of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase
were quantified by using a propidium iodide (PI)based cellular DNA flow cytometry analysis method.
Briefly, cells were rinsed in PBS, and 500 lL diluent
buffer (50 lL 0.1% Triton X-100 and 250 mg 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 50 mL PBS) were added.
RNAse digestion was performed by adding 4 lL
RNAse (10 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37 8C. Then, cells
were centrifuged and diluted in 500 lL diluent buffer
containing 20 lL PI and were evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany). Experiments were performed in 3 separate
experiments. Analyses of cell cycle data were done
with Cyclchred and WinMDI (Freeware).

Immunoblot Analysis
For protein analysis, cells were lysed in 100 lL of
62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% sodium
dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 50 mM dithiothreitol,
and 0.1% bromophenole blue. One hundred micrograms of protein per sample were separated on a
10% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher&Schuell, Dassel, Germany),
washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
blocked in buffer (1 3 PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% Iblock; Tropix, Bedford, Mass) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight
at 4 8C with an anti-CRM1 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-antirabbit secondary antibody (Tropix).
Bands were observed by using the CDP-Star RTU luminescence system (Tropix). Expression of COX-2
was analyzed as described previously.20

Apoptosis Assays
We used different assays to evaluate apoptosis after
treatment of ovarian cancer cells with LMB. The cells
were incubated with LMB as described above. In the
first assay, OVCAR-3 cells were evaluated for evidence of apoptosis by measuring the DNA content in
a double-labeling system with PI and annexin V
staining. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of
4 3 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and treated
with LMB (2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, and 10 ng/mL) after 24 hours. After 48 hours, cells and supernatant
fluids were collected together and were centrifuged
at 2000 revolutions per minute for 5 minutes. The
pellet was incubated with 100 lL binding buffer
(10 mM N-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-N0 -ethane sulphonate/NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM
CaCl2 in 50 mL of H2O), 2.5 lL annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) (Roche), and 5 lL PI. After 15
minutes, binding buffer (300 lL) was added. Cells
were measured immediately with the FACScan flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). Differences were analyzed by using the 2-tailed Student t test.
In an additional set of experiments, apoptosis
was examined by caspase-3 activity, a marker for
cells undergoing apoptosis, by using the FITC-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis assay (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, OVCAR-3 cells
(2 3 105 per well) were permeabilized, fixed, and
stained for active caspase-3 for 30 minutes and analyzed by flow cytometry (after 72 hours) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Campothecin, a potent
inhibitor of topoisomerase I, induces apoptosis and

Cell Proliferation Assay
To examine the effect of LMB on cell proliferation,
we incubated OVCAR-3 cells (plated in 96-well
plates; 3000 cells per well) for 24 hours and 48 hours
with LMB (5 ng/mL). Cell numbers were determined
by using an XTT (soldium 30 -[1-phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene
sulfonic acid hydrate)-based colorimetric assay (performed in triplicate; Roche, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Differences in cell
proliferation were evaluated statistically by using the
2-sided Student t test.

was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by flow cytometric analysis.

RESULTS
Clinical and Pathologic Characteristics of Ovarian Tumors
Ovarian carcinoma specimens from 74 patients were
investigated for immunoreactivity of CRM1 and
COX-2. The mean age of patients at surgery was
57 years (range, 32–84 years). Among the invasive
ovarian carcinomas, 45 tumors (60.8%) were serous,
23 tumors (31.1%) were nonserous (4 mucinous, 10
endometroid, 4 clear cell, and 5 transitional cell),
and 6 tumors (8.1%) were undifferentiated carcinomas. Of the patients with invasive carcinomas, 15
patients (20.3%) had FIGO stage I disease, 9 patients

cytoplasmic immunostaining of CRM1 are observed in a high-grade serous

(12.2%) had stage II disease, 45 patients (60.8%) had
stage III disease, and 5 patients (6.8%) had stage IV
disease. Lymph nodes from 60 patients were examined; among them, 38 patients (63.3%) had pathologically negative lymph nodes (pN0), and 22 patients
(36.7%) had pathologically positive lymph nodes
(pN1). Five patients had distant metastases at the
time of diagnosis. Clinicopathologic parameters of
the patients with invasive carcinoma are summarized
in Table 1. Among the 14 borderline tumors, 6
tumors were serous, 7 tumors were mucinous, and 1
tumor was composed of both serous and mucinous
parts.

CRM1 and COX-2 Immunostaining in Ovarian
Tumors and Normal Ovaries
An overview of CRM1 immunostaining is shown in
Figure 1A-D. We observed both a nuclear expression
pattern and a cytoplasmic expression pattern of
CRM1 in the ovarian carcinomas; therefore, both patterns were evaluated separately. Nuclear expression
of CRM1 was observed in 39 of 74 tumors (52.7%),
and cytoplasmic expression of CRM1 was observed
in 42 of 74 tumors (56.8%). In the majority of
tumors, we observed both expression patterns simultaneously but with different intensities. Only a small
group of tumors had solely nuclear (14.9%) or cytoplasmic (18.9%) expression. Ovarian surface epithelium of normal ovaries and benign ovarian tumors
showed only weak or no immunostaining of CRM1.

CRM1 indicates chromosomal region maintenance/exportin 1/Xpo1; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2.

Only 1 of 14 borderline tumors exhibited moderate
nuclear expression (IRS 5 9). According to a univariate correlation analysis, CRM1 expression levels were
increased significantly in invasive carcinomas compared with the levels in borderline tumors, benign
lesions, and normal ovaries (Table 2). COX-2 expression was observed in 19 of 74 ovarian carcinomas
(25.7%).

Correlation Between CRM1, COX-2, and
Clinicopathologic Features
In univariate analysis, we investigated correlations
among CRM1, COX-2, and clinicopathologic parameters (Tables 3, 4). We observed a significant association
between nuclear and cytoplasmic CRM1 expression
(P 5 .006). Nuclear CRM1 staining was correlated significantly with increased COX-2 expression (P 5 .002),

as illustrated in Figure 2A. Cytoplasmic CRM1 expression was related significantly to advanced tumor stage
(P 5 .043) and poorly differentiated carcinomas
(P 5 .011). Because the Silverberg grading system is
based on 3 morphologic parameters (nuclear polymorphism, mitotic rate, and growth pattern), we evaluated the association between CRM1 expression and
each of those parameters separately. There was a significant correlation between cytoplasmic CRM1
expression and higher mitotic rate (P 5 .008), but no
correlation was observed between CRM1 and nuclear
polymorphism or tumor growth pattern.

Association of CRM1 With Patient Survival
In univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, nuclear CRM1
expression was associated significantly with poor
overall survival (P 5 .010), as indicated in Figure 2B.

CRM1 indicates chromosomal region maintenance/exportin 1/Xpo1; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2.

No association with progression-free survival was
observed (data not shown). COX-2 expression was
related significantly to poor overall survival for
patients with ovarian cancer (P 5 .026). Other prognostic factors were residual tumor (P 5 .003) and histologic grade, which had borderline significance
(P 5 .076). In an exploratory multivariate analysis
that included histologic grade, tumor stage, postoperative residual tumor, age, and nuclear CRM1
expression, only residual tumor size had independent
prognostic significance.

Expression of CRM1 in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines
We determined the expression of CRM1 in 11 ovarian
cancer cell lines and in HOSE cells. Figure 3 demonstrates that CRM1 protein expression was detected in
various cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3, A2780, ES-2,
MDAH2744, CAOV-3, SKOV-3, OAW42, EFO27, EFO21,
and FU-OV-1). In contrast, HOSE cells and PA-1 cells
showed reduced protein levels of CRM1.
Effects of LMB on COX-2 Expression and
Cell Proliferation
COX-2 expression is associated with relevant tumor
signaling pathways. Therefore, we incubated OVCAR3 cells with inhibitors of 2 important pathways:
LY294002, a PI3K-inhibitor, and PD98059, an MEK inhibitor, to examine any effect on COX-2 expression.
In addition, we applied LMB, which is a specific inhibitor of CRM1. In Western blot analysis, as shown
in Figure 4A, COX-2 expression was highly inducible
by IL-1b. LY294002 and PD98059 did not influence
COX-2 expression at the protein level. In contrast,
LMB inhibited IL-1b-induced COX-2 expression in

OVCAR-3 cells. Treatment of OVCAR-3 cells with
LMB (5 ng/mL) revealed a significant reduction in
cell proliferation after 24 hours and 48 hours as
measured by XTT assay (P < .05; Student t test)
(Fig. 4B).

Effects of LMB on Cell Cycle and Apoptosis
To determine whether the inhibition of CRM1 by LMB
affects cell cycle progression, OVCAR-3 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of LMB at 3 concentrations (2.5 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 10 ng/mL) for
48 hours and were analyzed by flow cytometry. An
example of a histogram is shown in Figure 5A. The inhibition of CRM1 decreased the percentage of cells in
G1 phase. In addition, we observed an increased subG0/G1 peak that represented apoptotic cells. Induction
of apoptosis was confirmed by using different assays.
First, OVCAR-3 cells were analyzed with a doublelabeling technique using annexin V and PI staining
and then flow cytometry (FACS). A representative
example is shown in Figure 5B. After 48 hours, LMB
had induced apoptosis in approximately 15% of the
cell population. The percentage of apoptotic cells
determined for 3 different inhibitor concentrations
and measured in 3 separate experiments is indicated
in Figure 5C. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by
measurement of caspase-3 activity after 72 hours (Fig.
5D). The presence of apoptotic cells on the right in
Figure 5D is demonstrated by increased fluorescence
intensity (M2 gate) compared with the control. Finally,
we detected apoptotic cells by labeling of DNA breaks
with FITC-deoxyuridine triphosphate by using the
Apo-Direct Kit (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the expression of the
nuclear export protein CRM1 in primary ovarian carcinomas and ovarian cancer cell lines. CRM1 demonstrated both nuclear (52.7%) and cytoplasmic (56.8%)
expression patterns in ovarian cancer tissues. CRM1
expression was increased significantly in malignant
tumors compared with the expression in borderline
tumors and benign lesions of the ovary. To our
knowledge, this is the first study investigating the immunohistochemical expression pattern of CRM1 in
human tumor tissue. Our data from Western blot
analysis support the enhanced expression of CRM1
in ovarian cancer cells compared with immortalized
HOSE cells.
To our knowledge to date, there have been no
studies regarding the prognostic significance of
CRM1 in cancer patients. In the current study, we
observed that cytoplasmic CRM1-positive ovarian
carcinomas were at a more advanced tumor stage,
were poorly differentiated, and had a higher mitotic
rate. Nuclear CRM1 expression was associated significantly with poor overall survival. On the basis of

these findings, CRM1 may be an interesting biomarker for assessing the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. However, it should be emphasized that
there are certain limitations of this study. For example, all immunohistochemical-based studies have observer bias, because as the grade and type of tumors
can be determined during the analysis and cannot
be blinded. Furthermore, the interpretation concerning the prognostic role of CRM1 expression in ovarian carcinomas in this first study is preliminary.
Additional large-scale prospective and retrospective
studies will be needed to investigate whether it is
practical to use CRM1 expression as a prognostic
predictor.
We and others have demonstrated that LMB, a
specific inhibitor of CRM1, blocks COX-2 expression
in cancer cells.8,25 Several groups have demonstrated
that cyclooxygenases such as COX-226 and also COX127,28 are overexpressed in ovarian cancer, suggesting
that these enzymes may be interesting therapeutic
targets. In our study cohort, increased COX-2 expression in ovarian carcinomas was related significantly
to poor overall survival. It is noteworthy that we

1742

CANCER

observed a significant association of the nuclear
CRM1 expression with increased COX-2 expression.
The combination of functional data and in vivo data
suggests that CRM1 may play a role in the regulation
of COX-2 in ovarian cancer. Altered CRM1 seems to
be responsible for COX-2 overexpression during the
nuclear export of COX-2 mRNA, which is an important control point of COX-2 gene expression. LMB
had no effect on COX-2 transcription, suggesting a
posttranscriptional inhibition. Furthermore, it was
demonstrated previously that LMB inhibits the timedependent COX-2 mRNA export into the membranebound polysomal compartment at the endoplasmic
reticulum.8
Although our results indicate that COX-2 and
CRM1 are linked in ovarian cancer in vivo and in
vitro, we cannot exclude the possibility that other
proteins that are dependent on nuclear-cytoplasmic
transport are regulated by CRM1. In fact, this seems
very likely considering the central role of nuclearcytoplasmic export in cell biology. In addition to
COX-2 mRNA, CRM1 regulates nuclear-cytoplasmic
transport of NES-bearing proteins, which play a role
in relevant tumor signaling pathways, such as p53,
AKT1, HDAC5, and EGFR. This raises the hypothesis
that dysregulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic export may
be crucial in malignant transformation and, thus,
may be a promising field for future therapeutic
approaches.
The doses of LMB in our study were well in line
with those used in other studies that have investigated
nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. LMB is a specific inhibitor of CRM1 based on several observations17,29,30:
1) LMB covalently and selectively binds the sulfhydryl
group of Cys-529 of CRM1; 2) LMB inhibits nuclear
export by inhibition of the interaction of CRM1 with
the nuclear export sequence; 3) CRM1 is the major
protein that binds LMB in vitro and in vivo; 4) to our
knowledge, there are no reports on other targets of
LMB.17,29 We cannot exclude the possibility that there
may be other unknown cellular targets that may be
partly inhibited by LMB. However, although many
research groups are using LMB as a tool to investigate
nuclear-cytoplasmic export, to date, these targets have
not been identified.
It also has been reported that LMB has potent
antiproliferative and antitumor properties in murine
experimental tumors and in first clinical trials for
anticancer therapy.3,8 LMB causes a G1 cell cycle
arrest in mammalian cells,3 which is in line with our
observation in ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, we
observed that LMB induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells as measured by different assays. Other studies have reported LMB-induced apoptosis in cancer

cells (eg, prostate cancer and leukemia cells) by nuclear accumulation of NES-containing p53, BCR-ABL,
or the proapoptotic bcl2 member, BOK.13,31 Experiments with U937 leukemia cells indicated that the
apoptosis by LMB seemed to be related to cytochrome c release, activation of caspases, and selective down-regulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. Otherwise, it also is
conceivable that CRM1 overexpression inhibits or
delays LMB apoptosis.31
In fact, inhibiting the nuclear protein export of
elements of signaling pathways that are important
for tumor progression, such as p53, COX-2, and
others, may play an important role in anticancer
treatment; and substances such as LMB appear to
be promising candidates for therapeutic interference with these cellular functions. Because strong
toxic side effects have been encountered with LMB
during clinical trials for cancer, many efforts have
focused on novel CRM1 antagonists; and some
agents, such as PKF050-638 or 5219668, recently
have been identified.10
The results of the current study demonstrated
that CRM1 expression is associated with advanced
ovarian carcinomas that have an aggressive behavior.
Thus, CRM1 expression is related to poor patient
outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrated a correlation between CRM1 and COX-2 expression that may
explain the unfavorable prognosis of patients with
ovarian cancer. Supporting this point, we demonstrated that treatment of ovarian cancer cells with
LMB revealed a reduction of COX-2 expression.
Because it has been demonstrated that LMB acts as
a specific inhibitor of CRM1 in other cellular models,
this finding suggests that CRM1 may be an interesting biomarker for assessing patients’ prognosis and a
molecular target for anticancer treatment.
