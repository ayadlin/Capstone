Soluble CD200 Is Critical to Engraft Chronic Lymphocytic
Leukemia Cells in Immunocompromised Mice

Abstract
CD200 is a transmembrane molecule with an important immunoregulatory role that is overexpressed on most
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In this study, we characterized a previously unknown soluble form of
this molecule in human plasma termed sCD200. Levels of sCD200 were elevated in the plasma of patients with CLL
as compared with healthy controls, and there was a signiﬁcant correlation with CLL disease stage. Infusion of
sCD200hi CLL plasma into severely immunocompromised NOD.SCIDg cnull (NSG) mice enhanced the engraftment
of CLL splenocytes as compared with mice receiving sCD200lo normal plasma. CLL cells were detected in both the
spleen and peritoneal cavity of animals for up to 75 days. Engraftment of CLL cells did not occur after infusion of
CLL plasma depleted of sCD200 and was abolished in mice treated with anti-CD200 or OKT3 monoclonal
antibody (mAb), suggesting a role for both sCD200 and T cells in CLL engraftment. Notably, anti-CD200 mAb was
as effective as rituximab in eliminating engrafted CLL cells when administered 21 days after engraftment. Taken
together, our ﬁndings point to sCD200 as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CLL. Furthermore,
the humanized mouse model described here may prove valuable to preclinically assess new treatment regimens
for CLL. Cancer Res; 72(19); 4931–43. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous
disease characterized by the accumulation of malignant
CD5þCD19þ B cells in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and
secondary lymphoid organs. Some patients have a benign
clinical course, whereas others die of this disease within a
short time from diagnosis. Improved understanding of the
biology of CLL may help identify other variables predicting
which patients may have a poor disease outcome.
We have previously shown that CD200, an immunoregulatory molecule overexpressed on a number of solid and systemic
tumors, as well as cancer stem cells, played a functional role in
suppressing cytotoxic killing of CD200þ lymphoma and CLL
cells (1–6). Increased expression of CD200R, which is required
for signaling mediated following CD200 engagement, was
detected on a subpopulation of CD4þ T cells in the spleen of
patients with CLL relative to controls (6). Thus, CD200þ CLL
cells and CD200Rþ CD4þ T cells seem to colocalize in the
tumor microenvironment.

The CLL microenvironment is crucial for CLL survival and
proliferation (7). Nonmalignant constituents of the microenvironment, mostly T cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and
CD14þ nurse-like cells provide antigenic signals, cytokines,
and other CLL survival factors, such as B-cell activating factor
(BAFF), to support CLL survival and proliferation (8–11). T
cells in the CLL microenvironment are also known to express
CD40L, which, through stimulation of CD40 on CLL cells,
induces CLL proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways (12).
A number of studies have shown that CLL cells can directly
modulate T-cell function by expression of cell-surface molecules and/or production of soluble factors (13, 14). On the basis
of these data, we hypothesized that CD200 may be one of the
important factors modulating the CLL microenvironment
(2, 3, 5).
A number of membrane-bound molecules with immunomodulatory functions are known to exist also in soluble
forms where they are believed to play a functional role in a
number of disease states, including cancer. In CLL, soluble
forms of CD23, CD44, and CD14 have been reported to
augment the survival of CLL cells in vitro (15–17). We found
that CD200 could be shed from CLL cells after stimulation by
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and TLR7 agonists, inferring that a soluble form of CD200 (sCD200) might be present
in human plasma including that of patients with CLL (6).
The studies described later were designed to investigate if
soluble CD200 levels were increased in patients with CLL
relative to healthy controls and whether those levels were
related to disease stage. We also investigated whether
sCD200 present in patients with CLL plasma might contribute to growth/survival of CLL cells in NOD.SCIDg cnull (NSG)
mice.

Materials and Methods
Mice
NSG mice were bred and maintained under sterile conditions at the Toronto Medical Discovery Tower, MaRs Centre
(Toronto, ON, Canada). All mice were used at 8 to 13 weeks of
age.
Human splenocytes and CLL cells
The spleen from consenting patients undergoing splenectomy at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, ON,
Canada) was harvested at surgery and single cell suspensions
prepared in AIMV medium (Invitrogen). Cells were washed
(2), counted, and stored frozen at 80 C in freezing medium
[AIMV þ 40% FBSþ 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] at a

www.aacrjournals.org

concentration of 1  108 cells/mL either in 1.5 mL aliquots in
cryovials or in 30 mL aliquots in 50 mL Falcon tubes. At least
1011 cells in total were harvested from each spleen. An aliquot
(107) of fresh splenocytes was retained for cell-surface phenotype analysis in ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). For
in vivo studies in NSG mice, aliquots of splenocytes were
rapidly thawed at 37 C, washed in PBS, and cell aggregates
separated by centrifugation on Ficoll 400 density media (Sigma). Cells recovered after centrifugation were resuspended in
PBS at appropriate concentrations for injection.
Some experiments in which cells from the peripheral blood
of patients with CLL were used for reconstitution, CD19þCD5þ
CLL cells were puriﬁed from fresh blood as described previously (18). All protocols were approved by Institutional Review
Board.

Human plasma
Plasma samples from 82 patients diagnosed with CLL
at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre from 1996 to 2008
(Table 1) were stored at 20 C and used for retrospective
analysis of sCD200 levels in CD200 ELISA (see later).
For in vivo studies in NSG mice, plasma obtained at routine
clinical follow-up from a group of patients at late disease stage
(Rai stage III–IV), and/or with high white cell count, were
pooled into batches (>8 donors per batch). The control plasma
used was pooled from a group of 10 healthy volunteers. The
sCD200 levels in all plasma samples were assessed by CD200
ELISA. The sCD200 levels in pooled normal plasma were in the
range 0.5  0.2 ng/mL, whereas in various pooled CLL plasma
batches levels were consistently approximate to 10-fold higher
(5.0  1.3 ng/mL). Where absorbed plasma was used, the
pooled CLL plasma was absorbed overnight at 4 C with
anti-CD200 (1B9)-conjugated CNBr-activated Sepharose beads
(Cedarlane), a method previously shown to be effective in
absorbing sCD200 from plasma (6).
Antibodies
The rat anti-hCD200 monoclonal antibodies 1B9 and 3G7
were described previously (19). 1B9 was previously shown to be
effective in blocking CD200 function in vitro (6). For in vivo use,
Fab fragments of 1B9 were prepared using a Fab preparation
kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.).
The polyclonal rabbit anti-hCD200 serum, absorbed to deplete all anti-Fc reactivity (rabbit anti-CD200Fc), was described
elsewhere (6). A rabbit polyclonal antibody speciﬁc for the
extracellular region (vþc) of CD200 (rabbit anti-CD200vþc)
was generated by immunization of rabbits with protein
expressed from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with
an expression vector encoding only this extracellular domain of
CD200. The immunoreactivity and speciﬁcity of both sera was
characterized by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were used
as detection antibodies in CD200 ELISA described later.
Mouse anti-CD200R1-FITC antibody was purchased from
R&D systems, whereas all other monoclonal antibodies used
for cell-surface phenotype characterization (CD45, CD19, CD5,
CD20, CD40, CD23, CD38, CD49d, CD4, CD8, CD14, and CD56)
were purchased from BioLegends. Rituxan (Roche Canada)
was obtained from the hospital pharmacy. OKT3, used for
depletion of T cells in in vivo studies, was purchased from
Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals.
CD200 sandwich ELISA
High binding 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning Life Sciences)
were coated with the capture anti-CD200 mAb1B9 at
1.25 mg/mL overnight at 4 C in Tris–HCI, pH 8.1. Plates were
then blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with the blocking
buffer, 5% FBS in PBS, washed, and different concentrations of
either pure CD200Fc (standard curve) or plasma samples
(diluted 1:4 in blocking buffer) were added. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by 2 hours of
incubation with the detection antibody (rabbit anti-CD200Fc
or rabbit anti-CD200vþc) at a 1:2,000 dilution. Goat antirabbit
immunoglobulin G–horseradish peroxidase antibody at a
1:12,500 dilution was added and plates incubated at room

4934

Cancer Res; 72(19) October 1, 2012

temperature for 30 minutes. At least 5 washes with wash buffer
(PBS þ 0.01% Tween20) were conducted between each step.
After the ﬁnal wash, 3,30 ,5,50 -tetramethylbenzidine substrate
was added. All reactions were stopped by addition of 50 mL of
0.2 mol/L sulfuric acid per well after 5 minute of incubation at
room temperature in the dark. All plates were read at 450 nm in
a Multiskan Ascent 96/384 plate reader (MTX Lab Systems).
Engraftment of human CLL splenocytes in NSG mice
On the day of experimentation, mice received 2.4 Gy of
g-irradiation, followed by 1  108 human splenocytes intraperitoneally (i.p.), and 0.8 mL of pooled CLL plasma or control
plasma, also given i.p. Subsequent infusions of CLL plasma or
control plasma were conducted biweekly throughout the
course of the experiment. Mice were sacriﬁced at various time
points to assess for CLL engraftment. Spleen and bone marrow
were harvested from individual animals and cells in the
peritoneal cavity were recovered by ﬂushing the peritoneum
with 8 mL PBS. Single cell suspensions were prepared from all 3
compartments, and cells enumerated in a hemocytometer.
For immunohistochemistry (IHC) an aliquot of fresh
spleen tissue was ﬁxed in 10% formalin, and slides were
prepared and processed by the Pathology laboratory at
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Engraftment of CLL
cells was analyzed by multicolor FACS staining using single
cell suspensions and the various monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) discussed earlier.
CD200 blockade, CD200Fc, and T-cell depletion in vivo
studies
For CD200 blockade experiments, mice were randomly
assigned into 3 groups after infusion of human splenocytes.
Two of the 3 groups received sCD200hi CLL plasma, whereas
a 3rd group received sCD200 absorbed CLL plasma. Of the
2 groups that received CLL plasma one group also received
50 mg (i.v.) of Fab anti-CD200 mAb 1B9 the day after spleen
cell injection, and on 2 subsequent occasions at 72-hour
intervals. The experiments in which CD200F was used, puriﬁed CD200Fc was prepared in normal plasma at a concentration of 50 mg/mL, and was infused i.p. at the same dosing
schedule as that of CLL plasma.
For T-cell depletion experiments, mice received human
splenocytes and sCD200hi CLL plasma, or sCD200 absorbed
CLL plasma. The following day animals were randomly
assigned to receive 20 mg OKT3 (anti-CD3) antibody i.v., with
2 additional infusions at 72-hour intervals.
In studies comparing the therapeutic efﬁciency of 1B9 and
rituxan, mice were engrafted with human splenocytes along
with biweekly infusion of sCD200hi plasma. Twenty-eight days
following CLL infusion, mice were randomly assigned to
receive saline, 1B9 (50 mg/mouse) or rituxan (50 mg/kg per
mouse), all delivered i.v. in 300 mL. All treatments were repeated at 72-hour intervals for a total of 4 treatments. Animals were
sacriﬁced 8 days after the last treatment.
For each in vivo experiment, mice of both sexes were used,
with at least 3 mice per group. All experiments were repeated individually with splenocytes from at least 2 different
patients.

Role of sCD200 in CLL

FACS analyses
CD200 cell-surface staining was conducted using a rat antiCD200 mAb (3G7) as previously described (6). Multicolor FACS
analyses were conducted to characterize engrafted human
cells. The optimal concentration of antibody for staining was
determined individually for each antibody. Single color controls were included in each experiment for compensation
purposes, and all samples were analyzed in a Coulter FC500
ﬂow cytometer.
Statistics
Spearman rank correlation test and a Mann–Whitney U
test were used to determine the correlation between sCD200
levels and various clinical markers in CLL. All clinical analyses
were done using SPSS Statistics software. For in vivo studies,
the absolute count of each engrafted cell population (CLL or

A

T cells) was calculated from [total cell count  frequency], with
frequency based on FACS staining proﬁles. Unpaired t tests
were used to determine signiﬁcance between sample means.
Analysis of in vivo studies was conducted using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 software.

Results
Identiﬁcation of sCD200 in plasma from CLL patients
CD200 is normally considered a membrane molecule (20).
We have previously shown that CD200 was shed following
activation of CLL cells in vitro, suggesting it might also exist in a
soluble form in the plasma (6, 19). To explore evidence for a
plasma form of CD200 (sCD200), we established a sandwich
ELISA using 1B9 as capture antibody and a rabbit anti-hCD200
detection polyclonal antibody (rabbit anti-hCD200Fc) as
described in the Materials and Methods section. The sensitivity

of this ELISA using pure CD200Fc protein as standard was
found to be 0.05 ng/mL. CD200Fc was used to generate
standard curves in the range 0.05 to 10 ng/mL for quantitation
of sCD200 in samples in all ELISA studies. The reproducibility
and validity of sCD200 measurements was conﬁrmed in a
separate ELISA using a different antiserum (rabbit antihCD200vþc) as detection antibody.
The sCD200 levels in plasma from 25 healthy controls ranged
from 0.4  0.2 ng/mL. These levels were independent of age
(20–64 years) or gender (data not shown). Elevated sCD200
levels were observed in plasma samples from patients with CLL
across all clinical stages (Fig. 1A).
Serum sCD200 levels are associated with disease stage in
CLL
Although CD200 expression was detected in CLL cells from
all individuals in a cohort of 25 patients at various stages of
disease, the cell-surface expression level was not correlated
with either tumor burden or other clinical parameters of
disease (6). To determine whether sCD200 levels correlated
with CLL clinical parameters, plasma samples obtained at
diagnosis from 82 patients with CLL were tested in the
sandwich ELISA for sCD200 levels. The patient age in this
cohort ranged from 38 to 91 years (median age 61 years).
Correlation analyses were conducted to compare sCD200
levels with other parameters linked to clinical outcome in CLL
(see Table 1 for patient details).
Independent of the expression of CD200 on the cell surface,
the sCD200 levels were correlated with tumor burden (see
Supplementary Table SI), with patients in later stages of
disease (Rai stage III and IV) having signiﬁcantly higher
sCD200 levels than patients at early stages (Fig. 1B). In general,
clinical treatment of CLL is reserved for patients with late
disease and/or rapidly progressive disease (21). Using the
number of treatments received by each patient in our cohort,
regardless of the nature of that treatment, as a surrogate
marker for aggressive disease, we pooled patients into groups
who had received 2 or more courses of treatments versus those

with no (or only 1 course of) treatment. The former had
signiﬁcantly higher serum sCD200 levels than those with more
indolent disease as deﬁned by no treatment (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1C)
or only 1 treatment (P ¼ 0.0027, Fig. 1D).
Of the conventional prognostic markers for CLL, the sCD200
levels correlated most strongly with serum b2-microglobulin
levels (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1D). CD38 expression levels did not
correlate with sCD200 levels (22). The presence of intermediate- to high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (trisomy 12 or
deletions of regions of chromosomes 11 or 17) also did not
correlate with sCD200 levels. However, patients with CLL cells
that exhibited either a normal karyotype or 13q deletions,
usually considered to be indicative of a more benign clinical
course, were treated more often if they also had high levels of
sCD200 (P < 0.0001, see Supplementary Table S1).
Cultured CLL cells seemed to release sCD200 at variable
levels in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1); in
addition, the level of sCD200 detectable in CLL supernatant
correlated signiﬁcantly with sCD200 level in the corresponding
patient plasma (Spearman r ¼ 0.8858; P ¼ 0.033; n ¼ 5;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, sCD200 release by CLL
cells was inhibited by the global protease inhibitor GM6001
(Supplementary Fig. S1). These observations support the
hypothesis that CD200 is shed from CLL cells via mechanisms
of ectodomain shedding with the involvement of proteases
(23).
Development of a xenograft model for CLL
Given that sCD200 levels were higher in patients with
late stage and/or aggressive disease, we hypothesized that
sCD200 in CLL plasma might play a role in vivo in fostering
CLL growth. In a series of preliminary studies, we infused
1  108 puriﬁed circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes
(PBL)–derived CLL cells from 5 individual patients with
high white cell counts into each of 4 per group NSG mice,
with subsequent biweekly infusion of pooled sCD200hi CLL
plasma, or sCD200lo normal plasma pooled from healthy
volunteers. Although, animals receiving CLL plasma had

Role of sCD200 in CLL

greater engraftment of CLL cells than animals receiving
normal plasma, the number of human cells recovered was
generally low (data not shown), consistent with other
reports in the literature (24, 25). We considered that a
possible explanation for this poor engraftment might be the
absence of supporting cells that would be present in proliferation centers but not in the blood.
In an attempt to provide a proposed "microenvironment
factor," we next attempted reconstitution of mice with
splenocytes harvested from patients with CLL (Table 2;
ref. 26). The cellular composition of each spleen sample
was analyzed by FACS. In all cases, CD19þCD5þ CLL cells
were the predominant cells in the spleen, although the

frequency of CLL cells varied widely in a range from 25%
to 95% (Fig. 2A: 4 representative spleens). Expression of
CD20 and CD40 on CLL cells also varied, whereas CD200 was
expressed on CLL cells from all spleens tested (Fig. 2A,
bottom; CD40 staining not shown). CD4þ T cells were the
next most common population detected, with frequencies
ranging from 3% to 20% (Fig. 2B). CD8þ T cells and CD56þ
natural killer cells were also detectable (Fig. 2B, data not
shown). Low levels of CD14þ cells, previously reported to
produce BAFF to support CLL survival in vitro, were found in
all spleens studied (data not shown; ref. 27).

Role of sCD200 in CLL

CD19þCD5þ CLL cells at 28 and 54 days after infusion of CLL
splenocytes was seen in animals receiving CD200hi CLL
serum compared with controls receiving CD200lo normal
human serum (Fig. 3A, day 28; Fig. 3B, day 54). This difference was particularly pronounced in the peritoneal cavity
compartment (P ¼ 0.003, Fig. 3B). As noted, splenocytes
produced greater engraftment of CLL cells in both the spleen
and peritoneal cavity of NSG recipients compared with
engraftment seen using PBL (data not shown). Substantial
patient-to-patient variability was observed in engraftment of
both CLL and T cells (Fig. 3B and C, engraftment of spleens 1
and 5 shown). Accordingly, in all subsequent studies
described detailed analysis was restricted to use of frozen
aliquots of splenocytes from only 3 patients (spleens 1, 5,
and 6).
Characterization of CLL in humanized NSG mice
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain staining of spleen
tissue taken from mice at day 54 showed aggregates of
small lymphocytes resembling proliferation centers by H&E
staining that were absent in control animals (Fig. 3D, top).
CD20þ CLL cells were also more abundant in the spleen of
experimental animals by IHC (Fig. 3D, middle). All CLL cells
found in the peritoneal cavity and spleen of both experimental and control groups expressed CD40, CD38, and
CD200 at similar levels to the starting population (data
not shown).
Moreover, splenic CLL cells colocalized with T cells by IHC,
in a pattern reminiscent of that observed in proliferation
centers and in the spleen of patients with CLL themselves
(Figs. 2B and 3D; ref. 28). Note that T cells were found in the
spleens of mice injected with normal plasma, although CLL
cells did not engraft in this case (Fig. 3C and D, bottom).
Engraftment of cells other than CLL and T cells was minimal
regardless of the source of plasma.
In a study monitoring longer-term engraftment, in which
biweekly infusion of CLL plasma was continued to 1 week
before experimental endpoint, we observed persistence of CLL
cells in both peritoneal cavity and spleen at 70 days post spleen
cell infusion (Fig. 3E, engraftment of spleen 6 shown).
Engrafted CLL cells express the CLL markers CD19, CD5, and
CD200 (Fig. 3E), as well as CD40, CD20, and CD38 at levels
similar to that on CLL cells from the original spleen (Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, increased expression of CD49d
was detected in a subpopulation of engrafted CLL cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Engrafted human CD45þ cells in the bone
marrow were mostly CD4þ and CD8þ T cells at this time point
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Anti-CD200 and OKT3 mAbs abrogate engraftment of
CLL in NSG mice
To assess whether sCD200 in CLL plasma was an important factor contributing to engraftment of CLL cells in vivo,
animals receiving CLL splenocytes and sCD200hi serum also
received Fab anti-CD200 mAb 1B9. An independent group of
mice received CLL splenocytes, and CLL plasma that had
been depleted of CD200 by passage though an anti-CD200
CNBr column. sCD200 absorption from the serum was
conﬁrmed independently by ELISA (>97% depletion). Both
anti-CD200 mAb and depletion of sCD200 from plasma
attenuated the engraftment of CLL cells in vivo (Fig. 4A,
spleen engraftment; Supplementary Fig. S4, peritoneal cavity
engraftment).
To conﬁrm further that the presence of CD200 in human
plasma was sufﬁcient to enhance CLL engraftment, a recombinant form of CD200, CD200Fc, was used. The addition of
CD200Fc to sCD200lo normal plasma, at a concentration within
the range, which had previously been shown to be effective in
promoting survival of skin allografts in mice (50 mg/mL, i.p.),
enhanced engraftment CD19þCD5þ CLL cells in the spleens
NSG mice (P ¼ 0.04, Fig. 4B, CLL engraftment in mouse spleen
from 1 representative experiment using spleen 6 shown; ref. 29).
The effect of CD200Fc at this dosage seemed more pronounced
than that of CLL plasma, although infusion of sCD200hi CLL
plasma consistently resulted in enhanced engraftment of CLL
cells when compared with sCD200lo normal plasma (P ¼
0.05, Fig. 4B). The effect of CD200Fc for engraftment in
peritoneal cavity was less pronounced, although followed a
similar pattern to that shown for spleen (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
CD200 is known to deliver downstream signals through a
receptor CD200R, and we had previously reported that CD200R
was detected mostly on splenic CD4þ T cells but not on CLL
cells (6, 20). The absence of CD200R on CLL cells has been
independently conﬁrmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR; data not shown). We investigated the role of T cells in CLL
engraftment by treating mice in the early period post spleen
reconstitution with OKT3 antibody in vivo, analyzing CLL and
T cells 4 weeks later. Interestingly, in vivo depletion of T cells
abrogated engraftment of CLL cells, despite continuous infusion of sCD200hi CLL serum (Fig. 4C, spleen engraftment;
Supplementary Fig. S6, peritoneal cavity engraftment).
Comparison of anti-CD200 and rituximab in eliminating
engrafted CLL cells
In a ﬁnal study, we asked whether CD200 blockade could
eliminate engrafted CLL cells, thus highlighting CD200 as a

T-cell (bottom) engraftment at day 28 in the peritoneal cavity of animals given either sCD200hi plasma or sCD200lo normal plasma. Spleen 1 was used in this
experiment; result from 1 representative animal per group is shown. B, absolute count (105 cells) of CD19þCD5þ CLL cells in the peritoneal cavity of animals
that received either sCD200hi plasma or sCD200lo control plasma, in addition to spleens 1 or 5, at day 54 (data from 2 independent experiments were pooled).
CLL cell counts were obtained by multiplying total cell count with %CD19þCD5þ cells as found in FACS. Mice that received sCD200hi plasma showed elevated
engraftment of CLL cells in comparison with mice that received sCD200lo control plasma at this time point (  , P ¼ 0.003). C, comparison of CLL and

At 28 days following CLL splenocyte injection and biweekly
sCD200hi CLL serum infusion, independent groups of mice
received rituxan (50 mg/mouse) or Fab antimouse CD200 mAb
(i.v.). A total of 4 injections were given, at 72-hour intervals over
2 weeks. Animals were maintained for 10 days after the last
dose of treatment, again with ongoing injection of CLL serum
on a biweekly basis, and were sacriﬁced at day 45. The FACS
analyses on cell suspensions harvested from the spleen
and peritoneal cavity of these animals showed that both
rituxan (P ¼ 0.0026) and anti-CD200 mAb (P ¼ 0.0057) were
effective in reducing CLL engraftment in both tissue compartments (Fig. 5A and B). Essentially all CLL cells engrafting in the
peritoneal cavity were depleted, with signiﬁcant attenuation of
engraftment in the spleen (>70%). Although, the overall frequency of CD3þ T cells in either compartment did not seem to
be signiﬁcantly affected (Fig. 5C), the CD4:CD8 ratio in mice
treated with either rituxan or anti-CD200 mAb differed from
that in untreated mice (Supplementary Fig. S7).

was given a total of 4 times in 2 weeks. T-cell depletion seemed to
abrogate CLL engraftment regardless of the presence of sCD200 in
supplemented plasma. Data from 1 representative experiment using sp1

efﬁcacy of rituxan, a clinically approved monoclonal antibody
targeting CD20 on CLL cells, with anti-CD200 mAb therapy as
treatment in mice with established spleen-cell derived CLL
engraftment (30).

Discussion
The studies described in this chapter implicate a novel
soluble form of CD200 (sCD200) in the progression of CLL.
sCD200 is present at high levels in CLL plasma compared with
normal plasma and promotes the growth of CLL cells in
immunodeﬁcient mice, suggesting it may be a novel therapeutic target for this malignancy.
CD200 expression has been linked with outcome in many
malignancies (3, 31, 32). Biochemical analysis has suggested
that sCD200 is likely shed from the cell surface by proteolytic
cleavage, with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family of
proteases being prime candidates in this mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S1; K. Wong, unpublished data). We found that
plasma sCD200 levels, but not surface expression of CD200 on
CLL cells, correlated strongly with tumor burden, disease stage,
and an aggressive disease course as reﬂected in the requirement for multiple treatments. Plasma sCD200 was also correlated with plasma b2-microglobulin levels, known to be an
independent predictor of progression-free survival and overall
survival in CLL (33, 34). The value of plasma sCD200 as an
independent prognostic marker against current clinical prognostic markers remains to be determined.
The hypothesis that sCD200 is important in CLL disease is
supported by evidence for its contribution to successful
engraftment of spleen (and PBL)-derived CLL cells in vivo in
NSG mice. PBL-derived CLL cells generally fail to engraft in
immunocompromised hosts, although some engraftment was
recorded following combinations of i.p. and i.v. infusion of
PBL-derived CLL cells or following injection of an Epstein-Barr
virus (EBVþ) transformed CLL cell line (35, 36). Quantitative
comparison of engraftment using spleen or PBL from the same
patient has not been conducted to assess engraftment potential of CLL cells from these 2 tissue sources. Nevertheless, it is
clear that sCD200hi CLL plasma augments engraftment of
CD19þCD5þ CLL cells in both peritoneal cavity and spleen,
in contrast to the inferior engraftment seen using sCD200lo
plasma pooled from healthy volunteers with 10-fold lower
sCD200 levels (0.5 ng/mL). Those CLL cells that engraft in

infused biweekly with sCD200hi CLL plasma. At day 21, mice were divided into 3 groups and given one of rituxan, 1B9, or saline i.v. 4 times in 2 weeks.
Engraftment of CLL and T cells was assessed at day 45. P values were calculated from unpaired t test. Both rituxan and 1B9 were effective in eliminating CLL
engraftment in both peritoneal cavity ( , P ¼ 0.0057;  , P ¼ 0.0026; A) and spleen (B) without having signiﬁcant effect on CD3þ T cells (C). Results were pooled
from 2 independent experiments engrafted with splenocytes from Sp1 and 5.

both sets of animals express CD20, CD40, CD23, CD38, and
CD200 at levels similar to the CLL cells from the starting spleen
population, suggesting no selection for survival of unique
subpopulations occurred in vivo under these conditions. Interestingly, an increase in the expression of CD49d, a4 subunit of
the lymphocyte integrin VLA-4, which has been shown to play a
role in CLL homing to bone marrow in vivo, was observed in a
subpopulation of CLL cells in both spleen and peritoneal cavity
at 70 days postreconstitution (37). Because few CLL cells
engraft in the bone marrow, the signiﬁcance of this CD49d
expression remains unclear.
Engraftment of CLL cells in a xeno-microenvironment often
reﬂects persistence of donor cells, rather than proliferation of
CLL cells in the host, and engrafted CLL cells gradually decline
with time (24, 25, 36). The use of Epstein-Barr virus–transformed CLL cell lines circumvents this issue, although these
lines often exhibit very different biologic properties from those
of primary cells, particularly with the absence of CD5 expression (35, 38). In contrast, we did not observe a signiﬁcant

decline in the absolute number of engrafted CLL cells from day
25 to day 70 (data not shown). It remains to be determined
whether CLL engraftment in our model reﬂects both survival
and in vivo proliferation of CLL cells.
Because the engrafted CLL cells continue to express CD200
at high levels, it is possible that sCD200 may be released in
ongoing fashion from grafted CLL cells in vivo—this hypothesis
is supported by recent ﬁndings from assaying sCD200 levels in
mice at >6 months postreconstitution (unpublished data). We
have not investigated whether continual infusion of sCD200hi
CLL plasma is needed to sustain CLL engraftment, or whether
the engrafted CLL cells produce sufﬁcient amount of sCD200 in
vivo to maintain themselves in the absence of exogenous
sCD200.
Normal plasma and CLL plasma differ signiﬁcantly in their
content of multiple molecules, including many proteins and
fatty acids. A number of such molecules, including the B-cell
growth factors BAFF and a proliferation-inducing ligand, and
soluble CD14, have direct effects on CLL cells (15, 39, 40).

Wong et al.

Although, we do not rule out contributions by other factors
besides sCD200 in the support of CLL growth, 2 lines of
evidence from this study supports the hypothesis that sCD200
is a key contributor. First, preabsorption of sCD200 from CLL
plasma minimized CLL engraftment. Second, addition of exogenous CD200Fc, a soluble, recombinant form of CD200, to
sCD200lo normal plasma, which by itself had no effect on CLL
engraftment, resulted in enhanced CLL in vivo survival.
Our data also support a role for T-cell involvement in this
mechanism of action, as T-cell depletion (OKT3 in vivo) abrogated CLL engraftment, despite continuous infusion of
sCD200hi CLL plasma. This may help explain why, in preliminary
experiments, infusion of puriﬁed CLL cells alone, even with
continuous sCD200hi CLL serum supplement, produced only
minimal engraftment of CLL cells. The role of nonmalignant
T cells in CLL has been investigated by a number of groups (41–
43). T cells harvested from patients with CLL differ from normal
T cells by their high production of IL4 and reduced expression of
costimulatory molecules (42). The observation that CLL cells fail
to engraft in the absence of T cells despite sCD200 infusion
suggests T cells, a subpopulation of which have previously been
shown to express CD200R, may represent an important target of
sCD200 (6). Whether such sCD200-targeted CD200Rþ T cells
could affect CLL growth directly, or indirectly through the
action of other T or non-T populations, remains unknown.
Studies comparing the efﬁcacy of anti-CD200 mAb (Fab) or
rituxan as therapy for NSG mice reconstituted with CLL
splenocytes showed both were effective in treating preexisting
disease. Although rituxan induces lysis of CLL cells by complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity, anti-CD200 (Fab) likely regulates host resistance
to growth (44). In addition, both rituxan and anti-CD200 mAb
treatment seemed to affect the CD4:CD8 ratio in engrafted T

cells with a particularly marked increased frequency of CD8þ
cells observed in anti-CD200 mAb treated mice. The functional
and therapeutic signiﬁcance of these observations remains to
be determined.
In summary, our data suggest that sCD200, present in
patient plasma, is associated with disease progression in
patients with CLL, and its presence can be used to establish
a novel xenograft model for CLL, which may be useful for
preclinical testing.
