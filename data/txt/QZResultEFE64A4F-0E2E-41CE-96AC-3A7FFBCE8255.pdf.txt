BACKGROUND: In this superiority study, pemetrexed was compared with erlotinib in pre-treated patients with metastatic non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who progressed after first-line or second-line treatment were
randomized to receive either pemetrexed or erlotinib. In total, 21.7% of patients in the pemetrexed arm and 23.5% of patients in the
erlotinib arm had squamous cell histology, and treatment was third line in 39.2% and 46.4% of patients, respectively. The primary
study endpoint was time to tumor progression (TTP). Epidermal growth factor receptor/v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
homolog (EGFR/KRAS) mutation status also was investigated. RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of the TTP (P 5.195), the
objective response rate (P 5.469), or overall survival (P 5.986) between the 2 treatment arms. In patients who had squamous cell histology, erlotinib resulted in a superior TTP compared with pemetrexed (4.1 months vs 2.5 months, respectively; P 5.006). The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and asthenia was significantly higher in the pemetrexed arm, whereas the
incidence of grade 3 and 4 skin rash was higher in the erlotinib arm. CONCLUSIONS: Both pemetrexed and erlotinib had comparable
efficacy in pre-treated patients with metastatic NSCLC, and the current results indicated that genotyping of tumor cells may have an

INTRODUCTION
Platinum-based chemotherapy represents the standard of care for patients with stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or stage
IV non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1,2 For nonresponding or progressing patients, second-line chemotherapy with
docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib offers control of disease-related symptoms, improves quality of life, and prolongs overall survival (OS).3-5
Second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with docetaxel is associated with improved 1-year survival and
quality of life compared with ifosfamide, vinorelbine, or best supportive care.3,4 Pemetrexed, an antimetabolite
that inhibits key folate-dependent enzymes required for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis,6 has demonstrated clinical
efficacy comparable to that of docetaxel, but with a more favorable toxicity profile.5 There is evidence that the activity of pemetrexed is correlated with adenocarcinoma histology.7 Erlotinib, an inhibitor of the human epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TKI),8,9 reportedly confers a survival benefit over placebo in pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC.10 The improved outcome with EGFR TKIs is mainly confined to never
smokers and patients who have tumors that harbor EGFR mutations,11-17 whereas the role of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation status remains unclear.18-20 Because pemetrexed and

erlotinib have different toxicity profiles and routes of
administration but both are active in the second-line
setting for NSCLC, we decided to directly compare
these 2 agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

Pemetrexed-naive and TKI-naive patients with documented stage IIIB (with pleural effusion) or stage IV
NSCLC who experience disease progression after 1 or 2
chemotherapy lines were enrolled. Patients aged <65 years
must have received a platinum-based regimen, which was
not mandatory for older patients. After July 2008, an
amendment was implemented excluding patients who had
squamous cell histology.7 Other inclusion criteria were: a
performance status (PS) from 0 to 2; adequate bone marrow tests (absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, and platelet count 100,000/lL), renal
function tests (creatinine 2 mg/dL), and liver function
tests (total bilirubin 1.5 times the institutional upper
limit of normal [ULN], aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels 2 times the institutional
ULN); a life expectancy 3 months; and clinically stable
with irradiated brain metastases. Exclusion criteria
included: a second primary tumor, active infection, severe
heart disease, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. All
patients provided written informed consent, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics and Scientific Committees
of the participating centers. This study is registered as
National Clinical Trial NCT00440414 (clinicaltrials.gov).
Baseline and Follow-Up Assessments

Baseline assessment included a medical history; evaluation
of PS; physical examination; 12-lead electrocardiogram;
blood tests (complete blood cell count with differential,
platelet count, and blood chemistry); computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and brain; and a wholebody radionuclide bone scan. Patients were assessed with
physical examination, complete blood cell count, blood
chemistry, electrocardiogram, and a chest x-ray before
each treatment cycle.
Response was evaluated every 2 months during erlotinib administration, which corresponded to 3 pemetrexed cycles. Objective tumor response was evaluated
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors21 and had to be confirmed 4 weeks later. All computed tomography scans were reviewed by an independent
radiologist. Toxicity was evaluated before each chemotherapy cycle according to the National Cancer Institute’s
Cancer

Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.22 All patients were
followed until disease progression or death.
Treatment

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pemetrexed (Alimta; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind; 500 mg/m2
over a 1-hour as an intravenous infusion on day 1, every 3
weeks) or erlotinib (Tarceva; F. Hoffmann-La Roche,
Basel, Switzerland; 150 mg/day orally). Patients who were
allocated to the pemetrexed arm received supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. Patients in the pemetrexed arm were allowed a maximum of 6 chemotherapy
cycles, whereas treatment with erlotinib was continued
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of the patient’s consent. Primary granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis was not
permitted. Crossover between treatment arms was
allowed on disease progression at the physician’s
discretion.
Treatment Modification

Treatment was delayed for 1 week if neutrophil and platelet counts were <1000/lL and <50,000/lL, respectively,
and was withheld until the leukocyte counts recovered to
4000/lL and platelets recovered to 100,000/lL. The
occurrence of grade 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, or grade 3/4 nonhematologic
toxicity, diarrhea, or skin rash was addressed by a dose
reduction of 25% for pemetrexed or 100 mg daily for
erlotinib. If patients developed grade 2 through 4 neutropenia, subsequent cycles were administered with prophylactic G-CSF support. The study treatment was withheld
until nonhematologic toxicity was grade <2. Patients
were withdrawn from the study if they required 2 successive dose reductions.
Biomarker Analysis

EGFR and KRAS mutation analysis was performed as
previously described.23 DNA samples were extracted
from microdissected cells from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tumor specimens using an Eppendorf piezoelectric microdissector (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). The used primers and probe sets (Table 1) were
designed according to the Reference Sequences provided
on the LocusLink web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/gene/).
Exons 18 through 21, coding for the tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR, and exon 2 of KRAS were amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then subjected to
bidirectional automatic sequencing. All tests were

PCR primers were designed using human genome reference sequences acquired from the University of California
Santa Cruz Genome Browser (National Center for Biotechnology Information accession no. NM_005228 and
NM_033360), as previously described (see Table 1).23
Sequence variants were determined using Seqscape software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif).

Statistical Analysis

In this randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase 3
study, patients were centrally randomized by computer at
a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to PS, disease stage, age
(<65 years vs 65years), and response to first-line treatment. The primary study endpoint was the time to tumor
progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), OS, the objective response

rate (ORR), and safety. We assumed that, to detect a 35%
increase in the median TTP of 2.2 months for the erlotinib arm10 to 3 months for the pemetrexed arm with 80%
power (a 5 .05; 2-sided log-rank test) at the statistically
significant level of 5%, 163 enrolled patients would be
required in each arm.
Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis.
TTP was measured from study entry to the day of the first
evidence of disease progression, and OS was measured
from the date of study entry to the date of either death or
last contact. The probability of survival was estimated using
Kaplan-Meier methodology, and differences were tested
using the log-rank test. Cox regression was used for multivariate and univariate analysis for a unified view of the
effects of covariates on TTP and OS. All tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between January 2006 and April 2010, 357 patients from
9 centers were enrolled in the pemetrexed (n 5 178) and
erlotinib (n 5 179) arms. The Consolidated Standards for
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram (Fig. 1) for the

trial indicates that 12 patients in the pemetrexed arm and
13 patients in the erlotinib arm did not receive the allocated treatment because of early death or withdrawal of
consent. In total, 332 patients (n 5 166 in each arm) were
evaluable for response and toxicity. Five patients were lost
to follow-up after the first cycle of treatment and were
censored. Patients’ clinicopathologic characteristics (Table 2) indicate that 85% had a PS of 0/1, 22.5% had squamous cell carcinoma histology, and 43% had received 2
prior regimens (mainly a taxane/platinum combination).

Forty-eight patients (29%) in the pemetrexed arm completed 6 cycles of treatment, and 71 patients (42.8%) in
the erlotinib arm completed 4 months of treatment.
Treatment discontinuation in the pemetrexed and the
erlotinib arms was attributed to: death (7.2% and 19%,
respectively; P 5 .002), disease progression (53% and
69.6%, respectively; P 5 .002), withdrawal of consent
(3.6% and 0.6%, respectively; P 5 .065), adverse events
(0.6% and 5.7%, respectively; P 5 .008), or other reasons
unrelated to treatment or disease (6.6% and 5.1%, respectively; P 5 .245). G-CSF support was required for 27% of
patients in the pemetrexed arm.
In total, 669 pemetrexed chemotherapy cycles were
administered (median, 3 cycles; range, 1-6 cycles),
whereas the median duration of treatment with erlotinib
was 3.2 months (range, 0.2-48 months). Treatment delay
was required in 8.4% of pemetrexed cycles for the following reasons: hematologic or nonhematologic (1.2% and
1.2%, respectively) toxicity, and late admission (6%) for
reasons unrelated to disease or treatment. Dose reductions
were required in 2.1% of pemetrexed cycles and in 5
patients (3%) in the erlotinib arm.
Response to Treatment

Nineteen patients in the pemetrexed arm (11.4%; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 6.6%-16.3%) and 15 patients in
the erlotinib arm (9%; 95% CI, 4.7%-13.4%) achieved a
partial response (P 5 .469). In the pemetrexed arm, stable
disease was observed in 39 patients (23.5%), and progressive disease was observed in 108 patients (65.1%); whereas,
in the erlotinib arm, 29 patients(17.5%) had stable disease,
and 122 patients (73.5%) had progressive disease.
After a median follow-up of 27.3 months and 29.0
months for the pemetrexed and erlotinib arms, respectively, disease progression was documented in 303
patients (91%; pemetrexed arm, n 5 150; erlotinib arm,
n 5 153). The median TTP was 3.0 months (range, 0.327.3 months) and 3.9 months (range, 0.2-47.8 months)

Treatment Efficacy According to Biomarker
Status
EGFR

EGFR mutation status was assessed in 123 patients (pemetrexed arm, n 5 62; erlotinib arm, n 5 61) who had
adequate tumor tissue available (see Fig. 4, REMARK diagram). EGFR mutations were detected in 5 and 6 patients
enrolled in the pemetrexed and erlotinib arms, respectively.
No differences in terms of ORR, TTP, or OS were observed
between the 2 treatment arms irrespective of EGFR status.
Patients with wild-type EGFR (wt-EGFR) who received
pemetrexed experienced a higher disease control rate (DCR)
compared with patients who received erlotinib (42.1% vs
21.8%, respectively; P 5 .022). In the erlotinib arm, patients
who had EGFR mutations (mut-EGFR) had a higher ORR
compared with the wt-EGFR subgroup (33.3% vs 7.3%;
P 5 .042) and had a trend toward longer OS (23.0 months
vs 9.7 months; P 5 .067) (Table 3), with an estimated 1year survival rate of 83.3% and 36.5%, respectively.

months (range, 0.4-44.6 months) and 8.2 months (range,
0.2-51.4 months), respectively (P 5 .986) (Fig. 2b). The
estimated 1-year survival rate was 43.6% for patients
in the pemetrexed arm and 39.5% for patients in the
erlotinib arm.
Thirty-two patients (19.2%) were crossed over from
pemetrexed to erlotinib, and 7 patients (4.2%) were
crossed over from erlotinib to pemetrexed. Overall, 45
patients (27.1%) who received pemetrexed and 52
patients (31.3%) who received erlotinib received subsequent therapy for progressive disease.
Patients with squamous cell carcinoma who
received erlotinib had a significantly higher median
TTP, but not ORR or OS, compared with patients who
received pemetrexed (4.1 months [range, 0.2-33.5
months] vs 2.5 months [range, 0.4-20.4 months],
respectively; P 5 .006). No difference was observed in
terms of ORR, median TTP, or median OS in patients
who had nonsquamous cell tumors, according to treatment line or smoking status between the treatment arms
(data not shown).

KRAS mutation status was assessed in 109 tumor specimens (pemetrexed arm, n 5 58; erlotinib arm, n 5 51).
KRAS mutations (mut-KRAS) were detected in 17 and 13
patients enrolled in the pemetrexed and erlotinib arms,
respectively. Patients with mut-KRAS who received pemetrexed experienced a significantly better median OS
(P 5 .009) and a higher DCR (P 5 .009) than patients
who received erlotinib. Within the erlotinib arm, patients
with wt-KRAS tumors had a significantly better median
OS than the mut-KRAS subgroup (P 5 .001) (Table 3).
In univariate analysis, a PS of 0/1 (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.747; 95% CI, 1.265-2.412; P 5 .001), stage
IIIB disease (HR, 1.737; 95% CI, 1.149-2.625;
P 5 .009), and second-line treatment (HR, 1.620; 95%
CI, 1.281-2.049; P 5 .0001) were correlated with better
TTP; whereas PS (HR, 2.399; 95% CI, 1.699-3.387;
P 5 .0001) and disease stage (HR, 1.996; 95% CI,
1.217-3.273; P 5 .006) also were significant prognostic
factors for OS (Table 4). Multivariate analysis revealed
that PS, disease stage, and line of treatment were independent factors associated with decreased TTP and OS
(Table 5).
Toxicity

Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and
grade 2/3 anemia occurred significantly more frequently
in the pemetrexed arm (P 5 .001, P 5 .013, and

DISCUSSION
The current study failed to meet its primary endpoint,
because there was no difference in TTP between pemetrexed and erlotinib when administered to pretreated
patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. In addition,
there was no difference in terms of PFS, ORR, or OS
between the 2 treatment arms. Despite the exclusion of

patients who had squamous cell histology from enrollment after the Scagliotti et al study,7 the proportion of
patients with this histology (22.5%) remained high,
which introduced a bias concerning the efficacy of pemetrexed in histologically unselected NSCLC patients. The
required small (3.4 weeks) difference in TTP according to
the statistical design, although numerically small, would
be meaningful, which was the case for docetaxel3,4 and
erlotinib10 in a similar patient population.
The results of the current study are compatible to
those from the TITAN study, which compared secondline erlotinib with docetaxel or pemetrexed in patients
who progressed during or rapidly after a platinum-based
2762

doublet regimen.24 However, the reported ORR, PFS,
and OS were inferior, which probably can be attributed to
the poor prognosis of those patients because of platinum
resistance. Additional differences concerning patients enrolled on the TITAN study and the current study are: 1)
0% versus 42.7%, respectively, received the allocated
treatment as third line; 2) 13% versus 0%, respectively,
were of Asian origin; and 3) 36% versus 22.5%, respectively, had squamous cell tumors. In addition, the INTEREST noninferiority trial, which compared secondline gefitinib with docetaxel in both Asian and European
pretreated NSCLC patients, met its primary endpoint25;
whereas the V-15-3226 and the ISTANA trials,27 which

also compared second-line gefitinib with docetaxel, demonstrated that there was no difference in terms of survival
between the treatment arms despite the higher ORR in
favor of gefitinib.
In the current study, exploratory subgroup analyses
revealed some interesting observations that merit further
investigation: 1) Patients with squamous cell histology
who received erlotinib derived a significant TTP benefit
compared with those who received pemetrexed. Although
this observation confirms the limited efficacy of pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous histology,7 it is surprising, because EGFR mutations are mainly observed in
adenocarcinomas; thus, we cannot exclude a random
event. However, it should be mentioned that erlotinib has
demonstrated efficacy in unselected patients with
NSCLC.10,16,17 2) There was no statistically significant
difference in terms of TTP or OS between patients who
received the allocated treatment in the second-line or the
third-line setting, suggesting that third-line treatment
with these agents may be offered to patients who have a
good PS.
The exploratory analysis according to EGFR status
revealed that the incidence of tumors with EGFR-activating
mutations was comparable to that previously reported in
Caucasians,18,25,28 although higher frequencies have been
reported.16,17,29 Overall, patients who had mut-EGFR
tumors experienced higher ORR and TTP, but not OS,
compared with patients who had wt-EGFR tumors, as previously demonstrated.18,28 The 2 agents demonstrated
comparable efficacy in patients irrespective of their EGFR
mutation status (Fig. 5a,b), similar to previous reports
comparing TKIs and chemotherapy in pretreated
patients.17,24,28 However, a preliminary report from the
TAILOR study favored chemotherapy in patients with wtEGFR tumors.30 The observed higher ORR and the trend
toward improved OS in patients with mut-EGFR tumors
in the erlotinib arm support the predictive value of EGFR
mutations for response to TKIs12-15,17,19,28,29 and their use
in the first-line setting.12-15,31 However, the strength of
these observations is limited by the small number of tumors
analyzed for EGFR mutations in our study.
It has been reported that the presence of KRAS
mutation is a possible negative predictive factor for
response to EGFR TKIs16,18-20; however, conversely, a
positive correlation with pemetrexed efficacy seems to
exist.32 In the current study, no patients with mut-KRAS
tumors responded to erlotinib, although there were 2 responders in the pemetrexed arm; in addition, these patients
derived a significant benefit in terms of DCR and OS
when they received pemetrexed compared with erlotinib.
Cancer

Because the patients with wt-KRAS tumors who received
erlotinib had significantly better ORR and OS than the
patients with mut-KRAS tumors, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that KRAS mutations may be a negative predictive factor for TKI treatment and positive predictive
factor for pemetrexed treatment.32 Nevertheless, these
observations should be considered with caution because
of the small number of patients in our study who had
mut-KRAS tumors.
The toxicity observed in the current study was predictable and manageable, with hematologic toxicity and
fatigue mainly observed in the pemetrexed arm and skin
toxicity occurring in the erlotinib arm. There were no
cases of febrile neutropenia, but prophylactic G-CSF was
received by patients who developed grade 2 through 4
neutropenia, because a high proportion of patients were
treated in third-line setting.
The recently reported superiority of TKIs over
chemotherapy in the first-line setting for patients with
mut-EGFR NSCLC eventually will lead to patients
requiring second-line treatment upon disease progression.
Until new anti-EGFR agents or strategies to overcome resistance to TKIs prove to be effective, the administration
of single-agent chemotherapy is a valid option for this setting. In this context, the current study indicates that
pemetrexed and erlotinib are equally effective for patients
who experience disease progression after first-line chemotherapy. This appears to occur irrespective of EGFR status
and may be relevant for daily clinical practice, because this
information is often missing. In addition, KRAS status of
the tumor may also correlate with the efficacy of TKIs and
pemetrexed. Therefore, the data presented here may be
relevant for daily clinical practice and decision making.
