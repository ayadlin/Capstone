structure, favoring the compacted chromatin production that is
refractory to transcription (2). DNA hypermethylation in the
promoter of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) may play a crucial role
in carcinogenesis (3).
The deoxycytidine analogue 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC)
is widely used as a DNA methylation inhibitor to activate the
expression of epigenetically silenced genes. Once incorporated into
the DNA, 5-AZA-dC covalently traps DNA methyltransferases
(DNMT) in the form of a covalent-DNA adduct. Consequently,
cellular DNMTs are depleted, and genomic DNA is demethylated
during continued DNA replication, resulting in replication-dependent DNA hypomethylation (4). The covalent enzyme-DNA adduct
can be cytotoxic at high levels, but in vitro efforts aimed at
understanding the mechanism of demethylating agents suggest
that demethylation of TSG can occur at substantially lower
concentrations than those required for a cytotoxic effect (5).
5-AZA-dC can reprogram leukemic cells to differentiate toward a
mature phenotype (6); however, subpopulations may resist the
5-AZA-dC treatment, thereby remaining as immature precursors.
One approach to overcome this is to use specific differentiating
agents in combination with 5-AZA-dC.
Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) promotes differentiation of
human myeloid leukemic cells along a monocyte/macrophage
pathway (7). TNFa acts through cognate receptors (TNFR1 and
TNFR2) that relay downstream signals through a proapoptotic
pathway, mediated via TNFR1 (8), and a prosurvival/differentiation
pathway, mediated via TNFR2 (9). Activation of TNFR2 stimulates a
translocation of the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) family of transcription factors (p65, p52, p50, c-Rel, and RelB) into the nucleus. In
most unstimulated cells, the NF-nB complex is kept in an inactive
state in the cytoplasm by interacting with members of the InB
family of proteins, which mask the nuclear localization signal of
NF-nB. TNFa stimulation rapidly induces InB kinase h (IKKh),
leading to InBa phosphorylation and degradation. This in turn
allows NF-nB transcription factors to translocate into the nucleus,
bind their response elements as homodimers or heterodimers, and
activate target genes. The role of NF-nB as a tumor promoter is
well described, as its activation correlates with metastasis,
angiogenesis, and a prosurvival/pro-proliferation phenotype (10).
However, a growing body of evidence is emerging supporting
NF-nB as a tumor suppressor (11), as it has been linked to
p53-mediated apoptosis (12), a reduced angiogenic/metastatic
potential in epithelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (13),
and differentiation of leukemia cells as shown by our lab and other
groups (14).
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by a block in terminal differentiation of hematopoietic precursors and repression

Abstract
Transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation of genes
important for cell growth and differentiation plays a key role
in myeloid leukemogenesis. We find that clinically achievable
levels of 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC), a potent inhibitor
of DNA methylation, can modify chromatin and restore the
ability of tumor necrosis factor A (TNFA) to induce monocytic
differentiation of the acute myeloid leukemia cells NB4 and
U937. Although 5-AZA-dC cannot fully induce differentiation,
we show that 5-AZA-dC acts directly on TNFA-responsive
promoters to facilitate TNFA-induced transcriptional pathways leading to differentiation. 5-AZA-dC regulates the
expression of Dif-2, a TNFA target gene, by deacetylating
chromatin domains in a methylation-dependent manner.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the Dif-2 promoter show histone hyperacetylation and a recruitment of the
nuclear factor-KB transcription factor in response to 5-AZAdC. Furthermore, 5-AZA-dC plus TNFA enhances the level of
phosphorylated RNA Pol II at the Dif-2 promoter via
synergistic recruitment of TFIIH. We conclude that nonspecific changes in chromatin can allow a specific transcriptional
inducer to overcome blocks in leukemic cell differentiation.
Our results support the concept of low doses of 5-AZA-dC
acting in combination with other agents to target epigenetic
changes that drive malignant growth in leukemic cells. [Cancer

Introduction
Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression
that are not accompanied by changes in the DNA sequence.
Cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the only known
epigenetic modification of DNA itself and has a role in the control
of gene expression (1). CpG methylation silences genes by sterically
impeding binding of transcription factors that recognize sequences
containing CG or by recruiting repressor proteins that bind
specifically to methyl-CpGs. Moreover, DNA methylation has a
direct influence on histone acetylation and higher-order chromatin

of normal hematopoiesis. AML is often caused by specific
chromosomal translocations, such as t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), resulting in the generation of a chimeric
oncogene acting as a transcriptional repressor (15, 16). The driving
oncogene behind APL, PML/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) a,
represses transcription of RAR target genes required for cellular
differentiation via the recruitment of corepressive complexes that
include histone deacetylases as well as DNMTs. Treatment of APL
cells, as well as patients, with all-trans RA (ATRA) can overcome
the transcriptional repression and induce granulocytic differentiation. In addition, our lab has previously shown that ATRA can act
to overcome resistance to the differentiation stimulus of TNFa in
APL and non-APL AML cells (14, 17). Surprisingly, we found that
the combination of TNFa and ATRA did not induce granulocytic
differentiation via RAR-dependent transcriptional pathways (18).
Instead, ATRA enhanced the induction of TNFa target genes
involved in monocytic differentiation through remodeling of
chromatin to facilitate binding of other transcription factors,
including NF-nB, to their response elements (19).
In this study, we asked whether another chromatin remodeling
agent, 5-AZA-dC, could induce chromatin changes at the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (1). January 1, 2009

promoters of TNFa-responsive genes to potentiate or reactivate
the promonocytic actions of TNFa in AML cells. This is
significant as there are tumor types where ATRA is ineffective,
whereas the broad activity of 5-AZA-dC may translate into a
broader applicability. We show that low doses of 5-AZA-dC in
combination with TNFa induce monocytic differentiation in the
well-characterized APL cell line NB4 as well as in the non-APL,
promonocytic cell line U937. We show that 5-AZA-dC cooperates
with TNFa to activate transcription via DNA demethylation and
histone modifications. This facilitates binding of the TNFaactivated transcription factors p65/p50 to previously inaccessible
DNA-binding sites, leading to enhanced recruitment of phosphorylated RNA Pol II and, thus, gene expression. Importantly, we
show for the first time that a very low dose, 10 nmol/L, of 5-AZAdC is able to induce a time-dependent depletion of DNMT1 along
with DNA demethylation and histone acetylation at the promoter
of a TNFa target gene.

Figure 1. Continued . C, regulation of transcription factors involved in monocytic differentiation in NB4 and U937 cells. Western blotting was performed to determine
IRF-7 and c-Jun protein levels with h-actin as loading control. Densitometry analyses of blots were performed using GeneTools software. Densitometry values
were normalized to h-actin. The lowest normalized value then served as a reference for the ratio value presented. D, cytofluorometric analysis of TNFR2 levels

mRNA analysis. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol as previously
described (20). For Northern blotting, 20 Ag RNA was electrophoresed on a
1% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto Zeta probe (Bio-Rad)
transfer membranes. cDNA probes were labeled by random priming
(Pharmacia-Amersham). Hybridization and autoradiography were performed as previously described (18). Dif-2 full-length cDNA was a kind
gift from Dr. John Hiscott (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research,
Montreal, Canada).
Quantitative real-time PCR. cDNA was prepared from 5 Ag total
RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The relative
quantity of Dif-2 and DNMT1 mRNA was measured using the Applied
Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System, with glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase as the endogenous control. Amplification was
performed with 40 cycles of 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 60 s using the
following primers: 5¶-CGCTCTGGACCTCAGCACTT-3¶ (forward) and
5¶-TGTTTCTTTGTGGTTTTTCGGATT-3¶ (reverse) for Dif-2 and 5¶-AGGGAAAAGGGAAGGGCAAG-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-AGAAAACACATCCAGGGTCCG-3¶ (reverse) for DNMT1. A SYBR Green–based detection
method was used (Applied Biosystems).
Luciferase assay. Cells (5  106) were electroporated (350 V; 950 AF)
with 5 Ag Ign nB-containing pBIIX luciferase report construct (21). Assays
were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega) using a

13-acetate (PMA) were obtained from Sigma, dissolved in PBS, and stored at
80jC. Recombinant TNFa (PeproTech) was dissolved in sterile PBS.
[g-32P]ATP was purchased from Perkin-Elmer.
Cell culture. NB4 and U937 were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were treated with 2.5 or 10 ng/mL of TNFa and
10, 100, and 500 nmol/L of 5-AZA-dC for 48 h, unless otherwise specified.
For all experiments, control measurements were obtained from vehicletreated cells.
Differentiation assay. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay
and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for differentiation
markers CD14 and CD11b were performed as previously described
(17). Morphology was evaluated using May-Grunwald/Giemsa–stained
cytosmears.
TNFR1 and TNFR2 expression. TNFR1 and TNFR2 were detected by
FACS using FITC-labeled antibodies (R&D Systems). Fluorescence was
measured on a Becton Dickinson FACS.
Western analysis. Fifty micrograms of nuclear extracts, prepared as
previously described (17), were used for Western blotting to detect DNMT1
(MethylGene, Inc.), IRF-7, c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and total
acetylated H3, H4, H3 dimethyl arginine 17, acetylated H3 lysine 14-9, and
H3 trimethyl lysine 4 (Upstate Biotechnology). h-Actin (Sigma) confirmed
equal protein loading.

Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Values were normalized
with respect to protein content of the cell lysates to obtain the relative
luciferase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and
repeated thrice.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. The Upstate Biotechnology chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol was used with minor
modifications, as summarized in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Quantitative high-throughput analysis of DNA methylation by basespecific cleavage and mass spectrometry. Genomic DNA (500 ng) was
treated with sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Bisulfite-converted DNA was
amplified using specific primers and submitted to base-specific cleavage
and mass spectrometry using Sequenom MassARRAY EpiTyper as described

not fully functional. Of note, no significant cell death was detected
after 48 hours of treatment with 5-AZA-dC or TNFa in either cell
line, as determined by propidium iodide staining (<10% cells with
sub-G0 DNA content; data not shown).
We further analyzed the expression of two regulators of the
monocytic differentiation pathway: IRF-7 (Fig. 1C, left; refs. 26, 27)
and c-Jun (Fig. 1C, left; ref. 28). NB4 and U937 cells treated for 48
hours with 5-AZA-dC showed a dose-dependent increase of IRF-7
protein expression, whereas a small increase was observed with
TNFa alone. In the presence of both 5-AZA-dC and TNFa, a greater
increase in IRF-7 protein expression was observed. In NB4 cells,
48 hours of TNFa alone had no effect on c-Jun expression, 100 to
500 nmol/L of 5-AZA-dC induced a modest expression, and 5-AZAdC plus TNFa substantially enhanced c-Jun expression at all
concentrations studied. In U937 cells, TNFa alone increased c-Jun
protein levels (Fig. 1C, right), consistent with partial induction of
differentiation by TNFa alone in these cells. 5-AZA-dC alone
modestly induced c-Jun expression at 500 nmol/L and increased
c-Jun expression induced by TNFa (Fig. 1C, right).
We also evaluated the expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in NB4
and U937 cells by FACS. As previously shown for the combination
of ATRA and TNFa (17), 5-AZA-dC induces an increase in TNFR2
expression that is significantly augmented in the presence of TNFa
(Fig. 1D), whereas no increase in TNFR1 is seen (data not shown).
5-AZA-dC and TNFA cooperate to induce transcription of
TNFA target genes. To investigate whether 5-AZA-dC, alone or in
combination with TNFa, regulates transcription through NF-nB
response elements, as we had shown previously with RA + TNFa
(23), cells were transfected with a luciferase construct containing
an Ign nB. In NB4 cells, neither TNFa nor 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC
induced the transcriptional activity of this reporter, but transcription was enhanced 4-fold by the cotreatment (Fig. 2A). In U937
cells, TNFa alone induced transcription, but this could be further
increased by the addition of 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 2B). To confirm the
relevance of these results, we studied the effect of 5-AZA-dC on the
transcription of an endogenous gene containing NF-nB response
elements. Induction of Dif-2 (29), a TNFa target gene involved in
monocytic differentiation that is synergistically activated by ATRA
plus TNFa (17), was thus assessed after treatment with 5-AZA-dC
and TNFa (Fig. 2C and D). NB4 and U937 cells were pretreated
with 5-AZA-dC for 48 hours to allow for adequate 5-AZA-dC
incorporation into DNA followed by TNFa for 2 hours. In NB4,
TNFa alone for 2 hours did not induce Dif-2 expression, consistent
with a lack of differentiation response in these cells. 5-AZA-dC
alone induced a dose-dependent increase in Dif-2 mRNA, whereas
the addition of 5-AZA-dC plus TNFa induced this gene more
strongly (Fig. 2C). In U937, TNFa alone increased Dif-2 mRNA,
consistent with responsiveness of this cell line to TNFa, but the
addition of 5-AZA-dC potentiated the response (Fig. 2D). Taken
together, our results indicate that 5-AZA-dC potentiates activation
of TNFa-responsive gene expression.
5-AZA-dC treatment alters translocation of p65 and
facilitates recruitment of NF-KB to target promoters. TNFainduced transcription is IKKh dependent and can be inhibited by
selective inhibitors of this kinase, such as compound A (30). To test
whether the effect of 5-AZA-dC on Dif-2 transcription is dependent
on NF-nB/IKKh, we assessed induction of Dif-2 expression after
48-hour 5-AZA-dC treatment of NB4 in the presence or absence of
compound A. Indeed, the inhibitor significantly reduced the
induced levels seen with 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 3A). The inhibitor also
reduced Dif-2 induction by 5-AZA-dC plus TNFa (data not shown).

Results
5-AZA-dC and TNFA induce monocytic differentiation in
NB4 and U937 cells. Previously, we showed that addition of ATRA
to TNFa modifies chromatin to overcome resistance to TNFamediated monocytic differentiation in AML cell lines (20, 21). Thus,
we asked whether 5-AZA-dC could cooperate with TNFa to induce
differentiation in TNFa-resistant AML cell lines. NB4 and
U937 cells were treated for 48 hours with low doses of 5-AZA-dC
(10, 100, and 500 nmol/L) and doses of TNFa that had little or no
effect (10 ng/mL in NB4 and 2.5 ng/mL in U937), separately or in
combination. FACS analysis of NB4 cells showed that the
expression of CD14, a marker of monocytic differentiation, did
not significantly increase after TNFa treatment alone, whereas
5-AZA-dC caused a modest increase (Fig. 1A, left). The combination
of 5-AZA-dC with TNFa was a more effective inducer of
differentiation than either agent alone, substantially increasing
the percentage of CD14-positive cells. Similarly, U937 cells treated
with 5-AZA-dC exhibited a dose-dependent increase in the
percentage of CD14-positive cells that was enhanced with the
addition of TNFa (Fig. 1A, right). Of note, U937 cells were more
sensitive than NB4 to TNFa alone, and even at a lower
concentration, a weak increase in CD14 was observed. Interestingly,
TNFa plus 500 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC led to an increase in the
percentage of CD14-positive cells to >80%, which is significantly
greater than that observed with PMA, a well-known powerful
inducer of monocytic differentiation in U937 (22, 23).
There was no induction of CD11b, a granulocytic differentiation
marker, by either TNFa or 5-AZA-dC, alone or in combination
(data not shown). To confirm that the cells differentiate into a
monocytic phenotype, we evaluated morphologic changes of NB4
and U937 cells treated with TNFa and 5-AZA-dC for 48 hours
(Fig. 1B). NB4 cells treated with 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC + TNFa
display a lower nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio than control cells,
chromatin condensation, and irregular cytoplasmic contours,
typical of differentiated monocytes (24). TNFa alone had no
discernible effect on cell morphology, whereas 5-AZA-dC–treated
cells start to show a decreased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and
irregular contours. U937 cells treated with 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC +
TNFa showed irregular contours with developed pseudopods,
characteristic of a monocytic/macrophage phenotype (25), whereas
TNFa or 5-AZA-dC alone did not induce morphologic changes.
NBT analysis indicated that 5-AZA-dC and TNFa alone or in
combination did not induce any significant ability to produce
oxidative bursts (percent NBT+ cells, <5%) in NB4 and U937 (data
not shown), suggesting that the treatment-derived monocytes are

Demethylation Potentiates TNF-Induced Differentiation

Figure 2. 5-AZA-dC promotes transcription through NF-nB response elements. A and B, NB4 and U937 cells were transfected by electroporation with Ign nB
constructs and treated for 48 h. Induction of luciferase activity by TNFa and 5-AZA-dC was quantified. After reporter gene activity had been measured, the values were
normalized with respect to protein content of the cell lysates to obtain the relative luciferase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated
thrice. Columns, average of three independent samples; bars, SD. C and D, Dif-2 mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot. NB4 and U937 cells were treated
for 48 h with 5-AZA-dC followed by 2-h treatment with TNFa. Total RNA (10 Ag) was loaded in each lane and probed with Dif-2 full-length cDNA. h-Actin and
rRNA levels indicate equal loading. Densitometry analyses were performed on representative blots.

dC will not be fully exerted until the analogue-incorporated DNA
undergoes replication. We confirmed that 2 hours of 5-AZA-dC
treatment does not alter DNMT1 levels (Fig. 4A). To determine
whether the decrease in DNMT1 levels was due to reduced gene
expression, we analyzed mRNA levels of DNMT1 by real-time PCR.
A small but significant increase in the mRNA levels of DNMT1 was
observed in NB4 after 5-AZA-dC treatment (Fig. 4B), showing that
the decrease in DNMT1 protein on 5-AZA-dC treatment was not
due to transcriptional regulation.
The above results show that soluble DNMT1 depletion is
achievable at the lowest dose of 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC, and imply
that DNMT1 depletion is critical for demethylation and gene
induction. To assess whether these effects were associated with
DNA demethylation, a MassARRAY analysis was performed on the
Dif-2 gene in NB4 cells. MassARRAY provides a quantitative
measurement of multiple CpG methylation sites over long
sequences. The two different regions examined included a 362-bp
region in the promoter and a 397-bp region within the Dif-2 coding
sequence (Fig. 4C). Among the CpGs detected by MassARRAY, a
series of four consecutive sites all localized in the proximal
promoter region were hypermethylated in untreated cells (methylation level = 82–100%). These CpGs are localized in proximity to
potentially important gene regulatory elements (CACCC and CAAT
boxes). In contrast, CpGs localized within the Dif-2 coding sequence
or more upstream were unmethylated (6–20% methylation).

We next examined the effects of 5-AZA-dC on NF-nB signaling.
Western blot analyses on fractionated NB4 cells for p65 showed
a dose-dependent translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus after treatment with 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 3B). To assess
whether this increase of p65 in the nucleus would translate into
increased NF-nB binding to the Dif-2 promoter (Fig. 3C), ChIP
experiments were performed in NB4. These showed a significant
increase in p65 promoter binding in cells treated for 48 hours
with 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 3D, left) but, in agreement with
previous data from our lab (19), not in cells treated with TNFa
alone. When 5-AZA-dC and TNFa were combined, a significant
increase in p65 binding was observed. Of note, both 5-AZA-dC
and TNFa alone were able to recruit p50 to the Dif-2 promoter
(Fig. 3D, right).
5-AZA-dC depletes DNMT1 levels leading to DNA demethylation. The mechanism by which 5-AZA-dC induces demethylation
is believed to require its incorporation into DNA followed by the
formation of covalent complexes with DNMT(s), thereby depleting
DNMT cellular pools (31). Therefore, we examined levels of DNMT1
in NB4 after treatment with 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 4A). Western blot
analyses showed that the protein levels of DNMT1 started to
decline after 24 hours of treatment with all tested concentrations of
5-AZA-dC and were undetectable after a 500 nmol/L treatment for
24 hours or a 100 nmol/L treatment for 48 hours. DNMT1 requires
hemimethylated DNA as a substrate; therefore, the effect of 5-AZA-

we further examined the effects of 5-AZA-dC and TNFa alone and
in combination on the Dif-2 promoter. NB4 cells were used due to
their reduced sensitivity to TNFa, thereby allowing for a greater
appreciation of the synergy between 5-AZA-dC and TNFa. We first
examined the possibility of an enhanced recruitment of the
preinitiation complex protein Pol II to the Dif-2 promoter in the
presence of both drugs. ChIP analysis showed a recruitment of Pol
II in response to either 5-AZA-dC or TNFa alone, although
maximal promoter recruitment of Pol II was observed with the
combination of TNFa and 100 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC (Fig. 5B, left).
Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal repeat of Pol II plays a
crucial role in transcriptional elongation, and it has been reported
that NF-nB binding (33) can stimulate Pol II phosphorylation. We
investigated the status of Pol II phosphorylation at the Dif-2
promoter and found no significant induction of Ser205 phosphorylation of Pol II in cells treated with 5-AZA-dC or TNFa alone,
whereas the combination caused a significant increase (Fig. 5B,
right). Similarly, only the combination recruited the p62 subunit of
the Pol II kinase, TFIIH (Fig. 5C), which can mediate Pol II
phosphorylation (34). We then examined acetylation of histone H3
lysine 14, which has been linked to transcriptional activation, at the
Dif-2 promoter. Again, consistent with the above results, the
combination 5-AZA-dC plus TNFa resulted in a strong synergistic
increase of acetyl H3 lysine 14, whereas no increase was observed
with either drug alone (Fig. 5D). Our results show not only that
DNA methylation is required to maintain silencing of Dif-2 but also
that the erasure of the DNA methylation signature leads to specific
histone modifications that facilitate binding of TNFa-induced

Exposure of NB4 cells to a 10 or 500 nmol/L dose of 5-AZA-dC
reduced methylation in the regulatory region within 48 hours.
Taken together, the above results suggest that the decrease in
cytosine methylation at the Dif-2 promoter region is due to titration
of functional DNMT1 and that functionally significant DNMT1
depletion was attainable with only 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC.
5-AZA-dC–induced chromatin modifications allow increased Pol II accessibility to the Dif-2 promoter region
resulting in gene expression. Previous studies have shown that
inhibition of DNA methylation leads to histone acetylation (32). To
determine whether 5-AZA-dC induced general chromatin reorganization, we examined global levels of total acetylated H3 and H4,
along with more specific modifications of H3 associated with an
open and transcriptionally active chromatin. Western blot analysis
revealed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of total acetylated
H3 and H4 in NB4 cells treated with 5-AZA-dC for 48 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This effect requires incorporation into
DNA, as a 2-hour treatment produced no increase in total
acetylated H3 and H4 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Several specific
modifications of H3 associated with a more transcriptionally active
state also increased in response to 5-AZA-dC, in a dose-dependent
manner, and this effect was enhanced by TNFa (Supplementary
Fig. S3). We thus examined whether 5-AZA-dC modified histone
acetylation at the Dif-2 promoter. NB4 cells were examined by ChIP
using polyclonal antibodies against acetylated H3 and H4, and
10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC was sufficient to induce acetylation of both
H3 and H4 (Fig. 5A). However, 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC can induce
Dif-2 expression only in the presence of TNFa (see Fig. 2C). Thus,

epigenetic therapies and/or cytotoxic agents proposes 5-AZA-dC
as a biological response modifier to increase the efficacy of other
drugs. Here, we assessed whether 5-AZA-dC could increase the
efficacy of TNFa. Therapies with recombinant TNFa (rTNFa) show
antitumorigenic effects. However, severe toxicities are associated
with rTNFa at therapeutically efficacious doses and have ultimately
hindered its clinical development. Nonetheless, more targeted
strategies are currently being pursued in the clinic to reduce TNFaassociated toxicities (35). Here, we use a strategy of combining
TNFa with 5-AZA-dC to reduce the dose of TNFa necessary to
illicit an effect.

transcription factors and recruitment of the Pol II kinase TFIIH to
form a fully active transcription complex.

Discussion
The cytosine analogue 5-AZA-dC is a potent inhibitor of DNMTs
that is widely used in vitro as a demethylating agent and has
undergone clinical trials (phases II and III) in the treatment of
leukemia and hemoglobinopathy. Current clinical trials are
investigating lower doses for longer durations to optimize DNA
incorporation and to favor methylation reversal over cytotoxic
effects. Recent interest in combining 5-AZA-dC with other

encodes an antiapoptotic protein that is specifically expressed in
monocytes (37, 38), and may thus be directly involved in the
differentiation process stimulated by 5-AZA-dC in combination
with TNFa. 5-AZA-dC demethylated the Dif-2 promoter and
induced several histone modifications associated with active
transcription specifically at the Dif-2 promoter. Our data are
consistent with other studies showing that DNA methylation
targets histone modifications to gene promoters (39, 40) and that
the maintenance of epigenetic silencing and of associated histone
modifications is dependent on DNA methylation. It is important to
emphasize that although the lowest tested dose of 5-AZA-dC
(10 nmol/L) was able to induce some chromatin changes
associated with a more open structure, thereby allowing NF-nB
transcription factors to bind their response elements, it was only
when 5-AZA-dC was combined with TNFa that we observed
recruitment of the TFIIH complex, maximal Pol II phosphorylation,
and thus gene transcription. Therefore, in addition to the reversal
of repressive chromatin organization by 5-AZA-dC, a specific
activating stimulus, here provided by TNFa, is required to fully
induce transcription.
The accumulation of p65 in the nuclei of cells treated with
5-AZA-dC and the inhibition of 5-AZA-dC–induced Dif-2 expression in the presence of an IKKh inhibitor suggest that 5-AZA-dC
exerts a direct, activating effect on the TNFa-signaling pathway.
Although this may be an off-target effect of the drug, it may explain
the ability of 5-AZA-dC to induce expression of a luciferase reporter

Consistent with our previous work that ATRA acts on chromatin
of TNFa-responsive promoters to synergize with TNFa in APL cells
(19), this study used low doses of 5-AZA-dC in the APL cell line NB4
and the monoblastic cell line U937 to potentiate the prodifferentiation effect of TNFa. This effect requires nuclear translocation
of NF-nB, a transcription factor that can both promote and
suppress malignant growth (11, 14). However, TNFa alone had little
effect on the maturation of NB4 or U937 cells after 48 hours. We
found that treatment with 5-AZA-dC followed by TNFa resulted in
a much stronger induction of monocytic differentiation, as shown
by increased CD14 expression along with cytologic changes and the
up-regulation of c-Jun and IRF-7. This is consistent with our
findings that 5-AZA-dC can specifically influence the activity of the
TNFa pathway and supports the idea that 5-AZA-dC may
potentiate other differentiating agents. Of note, our results show
that costimulation with 5-AZA-dC and TNFa results in increased
expression of TNFR2 without an accompanying increase in TNFR1
levels, consistent with the observation that TNFR2 is the major
effector of the prodifferentiation/antiapoptotic NF-nB pathway,
whereas TNFR1 may play a more proapoptotic role (36).
We have begun to elucidate a mechanism whereby 5-AZA-dC
primes cells for TNFa-driven differentiation. We showed that
5-AZA-dC alone modified chromatin through DNA demethylation
to induce the expression of genes involved in TNFa signaling. We
found that 5-AZA-dC can synergize with TNFa to enhance the
expression of an important TNFa target gene, Dif-2 (29). Dif-2

Demethylation Potentiates TNF-Induced Differentiation

sensitizing of leukemia cells to TNFa is significant as it takes a
strategy used by Witcher and colleagues (49), and builds on it by
replacing ATRA as a chromatin modulator with 5-AZA-dC, a drug
with a broader applicability. That is, 5-AZA-dC could be used in
malignancies resistant to ATRA. For example, 5-AZA-dC has shown
encouraging results in solid tumor models, including breast cancer
cell lines, whereas the potential of ATRA may be restricted to
certain subtypes of leukemia. Our findings show that low doses of
5-AZA-dC are sufficient to induce chromatin reorganization of a
hypermethylated and thus silenced gene into a more transcriptionally permissive state. Furthermore, we show that these changes
can sensitize chromatin to additional modifications induced by
specific differentiating agents, such as TNFa. We thus provide a
mechanism for the synergistic induction of gene transcription and
differentiation seen in AML cells treated with 5-AZA-dC and TNFa.
The fact that 5-AZA-dC demethylates DNA in a global manner, and
also induces global changes to chromatin, implies that this strategy
could be applied to a wide variety of differentiating agents and
their respective gene targets. The DNA demethylation observed in
this study with a low and thus clinically relevant dose of 5-AZA-dC
along with its ability to potentiate the prodifferentiation effect of
TNFa provides support for the further development of combination therapies with low doses of 5-AZA-dC.

gene under the control of an unmethylated NF-nB promoter
construct (Fig. 2A) and does in part explain the recruitment of the
NF-nB transcription subunits at the Dif-2 promoter after 5-AZA-dC
treatment. The exact mechanism of increased p65 nuclear
translocation in response to 5-AZA-dC needs to be investigated,
but we speculate that it may represent a 5-AZA-dC off-target effect,
such as activation of kinases that mediate p65 nuclear shuttling.
A recent study from Robert and colleagues (41) indicated that
DNMT1 is necessary and sufficient to maintain global methylation
and aberrant CpG island methylation in human cancer cells. The
use of either antisense or small interfering RNA to deplete DNMT1,
but not DNMT3A or DNMT3B, potentiated the ability of 5-AZA-dC
to reactivate silenced tumor-suppressor genes, indicating that
inhibition of DNMT1 is the principal means by which 5-AZA-dC
reactivates genes. In accordance, our data show that 5-AZA-dC
induces a dose- and time-dependent depletion of DNMT1. Of note,
we found that 2 hours of 5-AZA-dC treatment does not alter
DNMT1 levels, suggesting that the effect of 5-AZA-dC will not be
fully exerted until the DNA undergoes replication and incorporation of the analogue. We suggest that DNMT1 depletion is due, as
previously proposed, to the trapping of the enzyme by the DNAincorporated 5-AZA-dC (42). However, a role of microRNAs in
regulation of DNMTs and methyl-binding protein at a posttranscriptional level has also been proposed (43, 44).
Importantly, the concentrations of 5-AZA-dC used here are in
the range of plasma levels of this analogue used in clinical trials
(45). Schrump and colleagues (46) showed that steady-state plasma
concentrations of approximately 25 to 40 nmol/L were achieved
during prolonged 5-AZA-dC infusion in patients with thoracic
cancers. Their published preclinical studies indicated that a 5-AZAdC concentration of 50 nmol/L was sufficient for NY-ESO-1
induction in cultured lung cancer cells (47). The concentrations
used for TNFa (2.5 and 10 ng/mL) are also well within achievable
serum concentrations as reported by Feinberg and colleagues (48).
We now show that 10 nmol/L 5-AZA-dC is adequate to cause
demethylation at specific gene promoters and, in the presence of
TNFa, induce epigenetic reprogramming and differentiation. The
