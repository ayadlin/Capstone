Abstract

Introduction

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine
kinase predominantly expressed in the developing nervous
system. Recently, mutated ALK has been identified as a
major oncogene associated with familial and sporadic
neuroblastomas (NBL). Yet, a direct correlation between
endogenous expression level of the ALK protein, oncogenic
potential, and clinical outcome has not been established. We
investigated ALK genetic mutations, protein expression/
phosphorylation, and functional inhibition both in NBLderived cell lines and in 34 localized and 48 advanced/
metastatic NBL patients. ALK constitutive phosphorylation/
activation was observed in high-ALK expressing cells,
harboring either a mutated or a wild-type receptor. No
activation was found in cell lines with low expression of
wild-type ALK. After 72 hours of treatments, small molecule
ALK inhibitor CEP-14083 (60 nmol/L) induced growth arrest
and cell death in NBL cells overexpressing wild-type
(viability: ALKhigh 12.8%, ALKlow 73%, P = 0.0035; cell death:
ALKhigh 56.4%, ALKlow 16.2%, P = 0.0001) or mutated ALK.
ALK protein expression was significantly up-regulated in
advanced/metastatic compared with localized NBLs (ALK
overexpressing patients: stage 1-2, 23.5%; stage 3-4, 77%; P <
0.0001). Interestingly, protein levels did not always correlate
with ALK genetic alterations and/or mRNA abundance. Both
mutated and wild-type ALK receptor can exert oncogenic
activity in NBL cells. However, wild-type ALK receptor
requires a critical threshold of expression to achieve
oncogenic activation. Overexpression of either mutated or
wild-type ALK defines poor prognosis patients. Alternative
mechanisms other than direct mutations and/or gene
amplification regulate the ALK level of expression in NBL
cells. Wild-type ALK is a potential therapeutic target for
advanced/metastatic NBLs. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7338–46]

Neuroblastoma (NBL) is a common and highly aggressive
childhood tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of
immature neural crest-derived cells (1, 2). Two thirds of the cases
occur in children younger than 5 years. Despite current intensive
multimodality treatments, children with metastatic NBL at diagnosis
have a 5-year overall survival that does not exceed 40%. Approximately 10% of the patients with localized disease at diagnosis
experience a relapse, and 20% of them become refractory to current
therapies (3, 4). Additional therapeutic approaches are needed to
improve the prognosis of NBL patients with advanced stage disease.
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase
(TK) originally identified as the COOH terminal part of the
transforming fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)–ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL; refs. 5, 6). ALK is widely
expressed in the embryonic nervous system, and its expression
declines significantly after birth. It has been proposed that
endogenous ALK expression promotes neurite outgrowth and
motor neuron generation (7–9). The mechanisms whereby ALK is
physiologically activated have not been completely elucidated. In
humans, the heparin-binding growth factor pleiotrophin (PTN) has
been shown to bind and activate ALK, although this issue is
somewhat controversial (7–11). In a study aimed at comparing
gene expression in human fetal neuroblast and NBL, ALK has been
detected among the genes up-regulated in unfavorable NBLs
compared with fetal neuroblasts, suggesting a possible oncogenic
role for ALK (12). Recently, ALK was identified as a major
predisposition gene in familial NBL, which accounts for 1% to 2%
of NBL cases. In this study gene gain, amplification and point
mutations were identified in germline and somatic mutations in
familial and high-risk patients, respectively (13). Increasing
evidence point to ALK as a crucial oncogene associated with
NBL (14–17). These results open new avenues to future investigations aimed at developing possible therapeutic strategies based
on the inhibition of ALK-mediated signaling.
In the present work, we directly tested the efficacy of small
molecule ALK inhibitors on NBL cell growth and survival. Our
results show that ALK inhibition, by small molecule inhibitors,
specifically hampers cell proliferation and induces cell death
of NBL cells expressing high levels of constitutively active ALK.
ALK inhibition was effective on NBL cell lines carrying either a
mutated or a wild-type gene. The immunohistochemical analysis of
82 sporadic NBL primary tumors showed a correlation between
aberrant ALK level of expression and NBL progression and clinical

outcome. Our findings provide experimental basis for pharmacologic inhibition of ALK kinase activity as a possible therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of ALK overexpressing NBL patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients. Eighty-two patients with NBL at diagnosis were studied. All
patients were diagnosed and staged according to the International
Neuroblastoma Staging System (18). MYCN locus amplification was
assessed in all patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Of
these 82 patients, 11 had MYCN amplification (stage 1-2: one patient, stage
3-4: 10 patients). Response to therapy was evaluated according to the
International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (18).
Cell lines. IMR-32 cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection; UKF-NB3 and SK-N-SH cell lines were kindly provided
by Dr M. Rodolfo from our Institute, and the NB5 cell line by Dr S. Morris
(St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital). NB-INT1 were obtained by SK-N-SH
subcloning. The t(2;5)-positive SU-DHL1 anaplastic lymphoma cell line was
used as positive control for NPM-ALK.
Antibodies. Anti-ALK antibodies recognizing intracellular regions:
mouse monoclonal antibodies ALKc (provided by Dr. B. Falini, University
of Perugia) and rabbit polyclonal antibody ALK11 (provided by
Dr. S. Morris). Phosphorylated Tyr664 ALK and the rabbit h-actin were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10), phosphorylated Ser473 AKT, phosphorylated Thr202/
Tyr204 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phosphorylated Ser727 signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)
were from Upstate Biotechnology.
CEP compounds. The small molecule ALK inhibitors, CEP-14083 and
CEP-14513, were reported previously (19). Stock solutions of CEP-14083 and

www.aacrjournals.org

CEP-14513 at 4 mmol/L in DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co.) were subdivided in
aliquots (50 AL) and stored at 20jC.
Construction of Tet-inducible RNA interference–ALK1961. The Tetinducible RNA interference (pTER)–ALK1961 construct carrying a doxycyclineinducible form of the RNA polymerase III (H1 promoter) was assembled
to drive the expression of specific ALK small interfering RNA (siRNA)
according to the procedure described by van de Wetering and colleagues (20).
Briefly, phosphorylated ALK specific oligonucleotides (100 pmol of each)
were annealed and cloned in BglI and HindIII cloning sites of the pTER
vector (kindly provided by Dr. H.Clevers, Center for Biomedical Genetics).
The ALK oligonucleotides used were:

5¶-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGCCGCTACTGCCCCTGGAGTCTCTTGAACTCCAGGGGCAGTAGCGGCGG-3¶.
Generation of ALK doxycycline-inducible siRNA cell line. pcDNA6TR
vector (Invitrogen) was stably transfected into IMR-32–derived cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions to generate IMR-32–derived cells expressing
the Tet repressor. The IMR-32/pcDNA6TR cell line was then transfected
with pTER-ALK1961. Double-stable Tet-cell line IMR-32-siALK1961 was
selected for 3 wk with Zeocin (Invitrogen), and individual clones
were obtained by limiting dilution. Expression of ALKsiRNA was induced
by adding 1 Ag/mL doxycycline in culture cell plates, and cell proliferation
inhibition was tested by [3H]thymidine uptake.
Viability assay. NBL cells were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at
10,000 to 30,000 cells per well in a volume of 200 AL in supplemented

medium, whereas lymphoma-derived cells were seeded in U-bottomed 96well plates at 5,000 cells per well. For proliferation assay, 8 h before harvesting
onto glass fiber filters, 1 ACi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well.
Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured using a filter scintillation
counter (1430 MicroBeta, Wallac). For viability assay, after 72 h of culture,
25 AL of 5 mg/L MTT (Sigma) were added directly to the cells followed by an
additional 4 h incubation, and then 100 AL DMSO were added. The
absorbance of individual wells was read at a wavelength of 550 nm.
Cell cycle determination. Ethanol-fixed cells were treated with DNasefree RNase (Boehringer Mannheim) and stained with 10 Ag/mL propidium
iodide (Sigma). DNA content and distribution of individual cells into
different phases of the cell cycle was assessed by using FACScan flow
cytometry and CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The ranges for G0-G1,
S, G2-M, and sub-G1 phase cells were established based on the
corresponding DNA content of histograms.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
samples were classified according to the conventional International
Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification system into undifferentiated, poorly
differentiated, and differentiating NBLs (21). Immunohistochemical detection
of ALK was performed using the anti-ALK mouse antibody Ab-1 (Clone 5A4;
NeoMarkers). Antigen retrieval was achieved by using the steamer heat
method. ALK staining was visualized by polymer detection peroxidase assay
(UltraVision LP, Lab Vision) and diaminobenzidine (Dako) as chromogen.
H&E sections were reviewed in conjunction with the immunohistochemical
stains. The type of reactive cells and the pattern of reactivity (nuclear/
cytoplasmic) were registered. Immunostaining was scored, taking into
account the percentage of antibody-reactive neoplastic cells and the intensity
of staining as follows: 1+, <10% reactive neoplastic cells; 2+, between 20% and
50% reactive neoplastic cells, heterogeneous with low-moderate intensity of
staining; 3+, >50% reactive neoplastic cells, with heterogeneous moderate/
high intensity of staining; 4+, >75% reactive neoplastic cells with strong
intensity of staining.
DNA sequencing. A total of 30 ng of genomic DNA from 43 NBL
samples was PCR amplified for exons 21 to 27 of ALK gene (Supplementary
Table S1), and products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare).
Bidirectional sequencing was performed by BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems) on the ABI-Prism 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). Sequencing outputs were analyzed with Sequencher 4.8
software. All DNA sequence alterations were not present in the singlenucleotide polymorphism database.13
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Copy number
variations of ALK locus were investigated by multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification. A total of 20 ng of genomic DNA was amplified with
primers specific for chromosome 2p23-24 (MRC Holland), including ALK
and MYCN loci, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.14
Statistical analysis. All values were calculated as means and 95%
confidence intervals. The Student’s t test was used to test for differences in
the means between two groups. Frequencies of patients with negative/low
and high ALK immunoreactivity were compared across distinct classes of
NBL stages using the Fisher exact test. Complete follow-up was available for
all patients. Event-free survival time was calculated from the time of
diagnosis to the time of progression or relapse. The life table curves were
constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the group comparisons
were made using the log-rank test. Time to event for event-free survival was
defined as the time from diagnosis until the time of first occurrence of
relapse, progression, or death or until last contact if no event occurred.
P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. P values of <0.01
were considered very statistically significant.

In UKF-NB3 and IMR-32 cell lines, the total amount of ALK
receptor (200 kDa) was comparable with the level of NPM-ALK
(80 kDa) present in the ALCL-derived cell line SU-DHL1 characterized by high level of expression (Fig. 1A). NB-INT1 cell line, characterized by low ALK expression, required a previous protein
enrichment step through a selective ALK immunoprecipitation
(Fig. 1B). No ALK was detectable in NB5 cells (Fig. 1A and B).
We investigated gene amplification events and missense mutations as possible causes of ALK overexpression in UKF-NB3 and
IMR-32. The degree of the ALK locus amplification was negligible in
both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Supplementary Table S1).
The mutational analysis revealed that UKF-NB3 carries the R1275Q
mutation previously described in familial and sporadic NBL cases
(13), whereas IMR-32 cell line carries a wild-type ALK gene as for
NB-INT1 and NB5 cells (Supplementary Table S1).
ALK activation status was evaluated both by Western blot
analysis and in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C). UKF-NB3 and IMR-32
cell lines showed constitutive ALK phosphorylation as opposed to
NB-INT1 and NB5 cells, which tested virtually negative. Consistently, autokinase activity was detected in UKF-NB3 and IMR-32
cell lines but not in NB-INT1 and NB5 cells. Intriguingly, the 140
kDa isoform of ALK receptor was tyrosine phosphorylated and
maintained autokinase activity despite the lack of its NH2 terminal
oligomerization domain (22).
ALK activation has been recently correlated to point mutations
in its TK domain (13). Interestingly, our findings indicate that
constitutive ALK phosphorylation can also occur in NBL cells
harboring a wild-type allele (IMR-32).
As PTN-induced ALK activation has been described (23, 24), we
investigated whether the active state of ALK in IMR-32 could be
ascribed to its putative ligand. Two secreted PTN isoforms (PTN15
and PTN18) are known. It has been proposed that PTN15 activates
ALK through a direct interaction, whereas PTN18 acts through the
PTN18/receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase h/~ (RPTPh/~)
signaling pathway (25, 26). Reverse transcription–PCR analysis of
RPTPh/~ expression revealed that RPTPh/~ transcripts were only
present in the ALK-negative NB5 cells, suggesting that the PTN18/
RPTPh/~ pathway is not involved in ALK activation in the NBL cell
lines analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Both PTN15 and PTN18
were detected in culture supernatants from high-ALK expressing
cells (UKF-NB3, IMR-32), low-ALK expressing cells (NB-INT1), and
ALK-negative cells (NB5). In particular, the conditioned medium
from IMR-32 showed a very low amount of PTN15 compared with
PTN18 (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Wild-type ALK native receptor displays oncogenic potential
in NBL cells. Our results show that ALK constitutive phosphorylation occurs in the high-ALK expressing NBL cell line IMR-32
harboring a wild-type receptor. To reveal native ALK receptor
tumorigenic potential, we investigated the effect of the downmodulation of ALK expression on cell growth and survival. A
doxycycline-inducible siRNA strategy was used to generate IMR-32siALK1961 stable transfectants. In our experimental setting, ALK expression was strongly down-regulated after 2 weeks of doxycycline
treatment (Fig. 2A). The peak of ALK depletion correlated with a
complete inhibition of cell growth, indicating that wild-type ALK
plays a pivotal role in the control of NBL cell proliferation (Fig. 2B).
ALK down-regulation results in inhibition of cell growth and
induction of cell death. To further assess the relevance of ALK
activation and ALK-mediated signaling for NBL tumor growth and
survival, we tested the effects of direct ALK kinase inhibition by
the small ALK kinase inhibitors CEP-14083 and CEP-14513. CEP

compounds have been shown to potently inhibit the kinase activity
of NPM-ALK in lymphoma cells (19).
As shown in Fig. 3A, CEP-14083 and CEP-14513 inhibited the
phosphorylation of both ALK and ALK-associated signaling
molecules (i.e., STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2) in a dose-dependent
manner in IMR-32 cells. We, thus, concluded that, in addition to
rearranged ALK, CEP compounds efficiently target also the native
ALK receptor.
At effective concentrations, CEP inhibitors did not affect the
survival of NB5 cells that do not express ALK. Remarkably, NBL cells
expressing low levels of native ALK (NB-INT1, ACN, SK-N-AS)
evidenced a similar behavior to NB5 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S3). CEP-14083 and CEP-14513 efficiently inhibited proliferation
of NBL cell lines expressing high levels of ALK either with a mutated

TK domain (i.e., UKF-NB3 and SK-N-SH) or carrying a wild-type TK
domain (IMR-32, IMR-5, GILIN, HTLA, SK-N-BE2). Within 72 hours,
f50% reduction of proliferation rate was observed in the presence
of 15 to 30 nmol/L CEP-14083 and 45 nmol/L CEP-14513. Notably,
CEP-14083 inhibited more effectively the proliferation of NBL than
ALCL cells included as positive control (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Fig. S3), whereas the inhibitory activity of CEP-14513 was equivalent
in the NBL and lymphoma cell lines. Inhibition of ALK kinase
activity induced by CEP inhibitors corresponded to a significant
increase of cell death in UKF-NB3 and IMR-32 cells compared with
NB-INT1 (Fig. 3C), suggesting a link between the level of expression
of endogenous ALK protein and its oncogenic activity.

constitutive kinase activation in NBL cell lines prompted to
question the in vivo ALK expression in NBL patients. To address
ALK potential clinical relevance, we investigated ALK expression in
paraffin-embedded primary tumors from 82 NBL patients by
immunohistochemistry. The patient cohort included 34 cases with
localized tumors (stage 1-2), 19 cases with stage 3 NBLs, and 29
cases with metastatic disease at diagnosis (stage 4).

ALK immunoreactivity was detected in 75 cases (91.5%) and in
each and every group of histologic differentiation (Fig. 4). All the
seven tumor samples found to be negative for ALK were from stage
1-2 patients. In all positive samples, ALK localization displayed a
membrane/cytoplasmic pattern. Staining was observed exclusively
in tumor cells, whereas Schwannian stromal cells and lymphoid
infiltrates tested consistently negative.

cSix of eight patients had a clinical progression of the disease; two of

bThree complete remissions and two stable disease.

The intensity of staining varied remarkably according to the
stage of disease. Interestingly, ALK was significantly overexpressed
in stage 3-4 compared with stage 1-2 tumors, indicating a possible
association between protein level of expression and tumor
aggressiveness (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4A; Table 1). Indeed, the 3-year
EFS probability for patients with absent/low (0, 1+) and high (3+,
4+) ALK positivity was 0.87 F 9 and 0.32 F 7, respectively (P <0.001;
Fig. 4B). ALK overexpression was equally observed in cases with
and without MYCN amplification (data not shown).
Yet, we identified eight stage 1-2 patients showing high ALK
expression and five stage 3-4 patients with low ALK expression. It is
important to note that six of these stage 1-2 patients experienced a
clinical progression and two died within 9 months from the relapse.
Conversely, stage 3-4 patients with low ALK expression are longterm survivors: three had a continuous complete remission after
49, 51, and 54 months from diagnosis, and two had a very good
partial remission after 38 and 40 months from diagnosis (Table 1).
ALK overexpression in NBL tumor samples did not associate
with activating mutations. Recent data point to the involvement
of mutations in the TK domain of ALK in NBL aggressiveness
(13–17). To establish a link between missense mutations and
the overexpression of ALK observed in poor prognosis NBLs,
we sequenced the entire TK domain of 21 stage 1-2 and 22 stage 3-4
patients described in Fig. 4.
As expected, activating mutations were observed only in tumor
samples displaying high immunoreactivity for ALK: one sample
from stage 1-2 and three samples from stage 3-4 NBLs. However,
the majority (18 of 22, 81.8%) of the tumor samples showing high
ALK immunoreactivity was characterized by wild-type TK domain
both in stage 1-2, as well as in stage 3-4 NBLs (Table 2).
Interestingly, the patient with localized tumor displaying an
elevated amount of mutated ALK (sample ID 2875) did not
experience any disease progression, as opposed to relapsing stage
1-2 patients (sample ID 1227, 1363, 1458; 1600, 1668) characterized
by high ALK immunoreactivity and a wild-type ALK TK domain.
As amplification of the genomic ALK locus has been proposed as
mechanism of ALK up-regulation (27), we assayed the occurrence
of ALK gene copy number alterations that could lead to the
overexpression of the ALK protein observed in stage 1-2 tumors. No
high-level focal amplification was observed (Table 2). One case
showed unbalanced gain of a large genomic region at 2p including
the ALK locus, and one additional case showed a chromosome 2
trisomy. The remaining tumor samples had a normal 2n copy of

ALK, including stage 1-2 patients who died of the progressive
disease (sample ID 1458, 1668).
Absence of germline promoter mutations affecting ALK
expression. As the underlying genetic causes determining high
levels of ALK expression remained to be determined in a
considerable proportion of patients, we investigated whether
missense mutations in the promoter sequence could account for
ALK overexpression (28, 29). Genomic DNA from eight cell lines
and 29 patients (ALK negative/low, 9 patients; ALK moderate, 6
patients; ALK high, 14 patients) expressing wild-type ALK was
subjected to sequence analysis in the 2,564-bp region upstream of
the translation start codon containing the putative promoter of
ALK. No sequence variants were found.
Finally, the relation between ALK protein and transcript
expression was further investigated within additional 18 tumor
samples classified for their protein expression level quantified by
immunohistochemistry. mRNA levels were assayed by Taqman
real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4C, the abundance of ALK
transcripts did not always correlate with the level of ALK
immunoreactivity detected in primary NBLs. ALK mRNA expression was comparable in tumors showing low and high ALK
immunoreactivity (P = 0.7323), whereas it was lower in samples
with moderate ALK immunoreactivity (P = 0.0315 and P = 0.04,
statistically significant).

Discussion
Recent evidence indicates a pivotal role for the ALK TK receptor
in both familial and sporadic NBL pathogenesis (13–17). A
significant correlation between activating mutations in the ALK
TK domain and poor clinical outcome has been shown in sporadic
NBLs. Yet, mutations at the ALK locus have only been reported for
a limited number of cases. Missense mutations have been found in
8.4%, whereas focal amplifications have been detected in 3.5% of
the surveyed high-risk patients (13). The limited incidence of ALK
mutations in sporadic NBLs suggests that ALK-independent
oncogenic mechanisms are common in NBL pathogenesis.
However, this observation does not exclude the possible involvement of the wild-type ALK protein in the pathogenic process. To
gain more insight into the role of the wild-type receptor, we
investigated ALK expression in both NBL cell lines and NBL
patients. Data presented in this study indicate that the native ALK
receptor can exert oncogenic activity in NBL cells, in addition to its
mutated isoforms.
Previous studies indicated that NBL-derived cell lines harboring
mutated ALK alleles exhibit constitutive ALK phosphorylation (13,
16). Interestingly, we observed aberrant phosphorylation in both
UFK-NB3 cell line carrying the R1275Q mutation and IMR-32 cell
line that carries a wild-type ALK. This finding indicates that
mechanisms other than genetic alterations can lead to constitutive
ALK activation. We did not observed ALK phosphorylation in NBINT1 cells, which showed very low ALK expression compared with
IMR-32 and UKF-NB3, suggesting a positive correlation between
ALK abundance and its constitutive activation.
IMR-32 cells displayed a higher activity of the 200-kDa band
compared with the UKF-NB3 cells in the kinase assay. These
difference are in agreement with similar findings by Miyake and
colleagues (30) showing differences in the extent of kinase activity
of ALK in NBL cell lines with high level of expression of ALK.
Interestingly, also the 140-kDa isoform results phosphorylated
exclusively in high-ALK expressing cells. It is intriguing to

hypothesize that ALK isoform-140 could contribute to determining
the ultimate oncogenic potential of ALK in addition to the ALK
native receptor isoform-200. The presence of the ALK isoform-140
suggests distinctive biological traits associated with ALK receptor
activation and/or molecular processing that differentiate NBLs
from other ALK expressing tumors, such as lymphoma.
To investigate the functional relevance of the activation of the
wild-type ALK receptor in IMR-32 cells, we down-regulated both its
expression using an inducible RNA interference approach and its
kinase activity by small kinase ALK inhibitors CEP-14083 and CEP14513. Inhibition of ALK in IMR-32 cells specifically hampered
cellular proliferation and induced cell death, strongly supporting a
functional relevant oncogenic activity mediated by the wild-type
ALK receptor. Noteworthy, the inhibitory effect of CEP compounds
was observed in NBL cell lines showing ALK overexpression and
activation, harboring either a mutated (UKF-NB3, SK-N-SH) or a
wild-type (IMR-32, HTLA, GILIN, IMR-5, SK-N-BE2) receptor but
not in NB-INT1, ACN, and SK-N-AS cells expressing low amounts of
ALK, underlining the requirement of a critical threshold of protein
expression to achieve oncogenic activity.
The molecular mechanisms responsible for ALK overexpression
in NBL cells need further elucidations. We detected negligible ALK
amplification and no missense mutations in TK domain and/or in
the promoter region that could justify the aberrant level of ALK
protein expression. In addition, our results point to limited, if any,
involvement of PTN in determining ALK constitutive oncogenic
activation. Indeed, high-ALK expressing IMR-32 cells displayed

ALK constitutive activation combined with low level of secreted
PTN15. The analysis of transcript abundance in a restricted
number of patients indicates that the accumulation of the ALK
protein can occur independently from its transcriptional upregulation. This observation outlines the involvement of posttranscriptional modifications, possibly interfering with protein stability.
Indeed, a prolonged persistence of activated ALK on the cell
surface due to reduced rate of internalization and the association
of ALK with heat shock proteins have been described (31, 32).
The tenet that protein overexpression actively contributes to ALKmediated oncogenic activity is further supported by the data
obtained in NBL patients. Our immunohistochemical analyses
conducted on a large cohort of patients showed major differences
in ALK expression between stage 1-2 and stage 3-4 NBL patients. In
general, localized and poorly aggressive tumors (stage 1-2) had a low
level of ALK expression. In contrast, more aggressive and metastatic
tumors (stage 3-4) exhibited ALK overexpression. However, exceptions to this trend were observed. Six of eight stage 1-2 patients
whose tumors showed ALK overexpression had an unfavorable
clinical outcome, whereas all five stage 3-4 patients with low level
ALK expressing tumors had a favorable outcome. These observations
point to ALK oncogenic relevance in NBL cells and corroborate ALK
overexpression as an indicator of poor clinical outcome.
Previous studies showed no significant link between ALK
expression and prognosis (27, 33). This discrepancy may be
ascribed to differences in the size of the patient cohort (82 versus
16 and 22 patients), in the criterion of patient stratification (disease

stage versus MYCN amplification), and in the experimental
protocol (immunohistochemistry versus Western blot analysis).
In agreement with the results showing that only 8% to 10% of
tumors from high-risk patients had single-base substitutions consistent with activating mutations (13), we observed low frequency of ALK
missense mutations in the NBL patients with high levels of ALK
expression. The majority of advanced/metastatic patients (stage 3-4)
were characterized by the expression of a wild-type ALK. Intriguingly,
also the stage 1-2 patients who died of disease progression had wildtype ALK, further emphasizing both the oncogenic potential and the
clinical implications of the ALK native receptor.
Despite progress in treatment modalities, children with metastatic
NBL (stage 4) at diagnosis still have a 5-year overall survival of <40%
(34–36). The possibility to develop alternative therapeutic strategies
based on ALK molecular targeting for advanced/metastatic NBLs is
an attractive opportunity. CEP-14083 and CEP-14513 exert potent
cytotoxic effect on high-ALK expressing wild-type IMR-32 cells,
UKF-NB3 cells carrying the R1275Q mutation, and SK-N-SH carrying
the F1174L mutation. The R1275Q mutation was detected both in
familial and sporadic NBLs (13) and, together with F1174L,
represents the most frequent ALK mutation thus far detected in
NBL (15, 17). Therefore, it is conceivable to hypothesize that ALK
targeting by small molecule inhibitors can be a valid therapeutic
strategy for NBL patients having an elevated level of expression of
either wild-type and/or mutated ALK.
It has been proposed that activating mutations of ALK confer
sensitivity to ALK inhibition by small molecule inhibitors in NBL
cell lines, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy
(15, 37). As suggested by the ALK-positive lymphoma model in
which there is no documented single-base substitutions within the

TK domain of ALK-translocated variants, our data clearly indicate
that the wild-type TK domain overexpressed in IMR-32 cell line can
be functionally inhibited by small molecule ALK inhibitors. This
observation opens new opportunities for the development of novel
therapeutic strategies based upon ALK targeting. Indeed, we
envisage the possibility to extend the use of small molecule ALK
inhibitors to a broader cohort of high-risk NBL patients expressing
high protein levels of either mutated or wild-type ALK receptor.
This group of patients could be represented by relapsed stage 1-2
patients with progressive disease and the majority of advanced/
metastatic stage 3-4 patients.
