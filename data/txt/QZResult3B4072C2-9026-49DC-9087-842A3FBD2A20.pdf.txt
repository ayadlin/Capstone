ABSTRACT
T-cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is highly expressed in several cancer cells
and promotes tumorigenesis and progression, and therefore, it is an important target
for drug treatment of tumor. Pantoprazole (PPZ) was identified to be a TOPK inhibitor
from FDA-approved drug database by structure based virtual ligand screening. Herein,
the data indicated that pantoprazole inhibited TOPK activities by directly binding with
TOPK in vitro and in vivo. Ex vivo studies showed that pantoprazole inhibited TOPK
activities in JB6 Cl41 cells and HCT 116 colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown
of TOPK in HCT 116 cells decreased their sensitivities to pantoprazole. Results of an in
vivo study demonstrated that i.p. injection of pantoprazole in HCT 116 colon tumorbearing mice effectively suppressed cancer growth. The TOPK downstream signaling
molecule phospho-histone H3 in tumor tissues was also decreased after pantoprazole
treatment. In short, pantoprazole can suppress growth of colorectal cancer cells as
a TOPK inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo.

of protein-protein interactions. In this study, we devote
ourselves to studying T-cell-originated protein kinase
(TOPK) inhibitors.
TOPK is a serine-threonine kinase, a member
of MAPKK family. TOPK was confirmed to be highly
expressed in multiple types of cancers and associated
with poor prognosis, such as lymphoma, leukemia,
melanoma, colorectal, breast and lung cancers, and
cholangiocarcinoma [3-10]. Also, TOPK plays an
important role in tumor development and progression [1113]. Above all, TOPK exhibits high expression levels in
cancer tissues but only low expression levels in normal

INTRODUCTION
Recently, cancer drug development has shifted
from traditional cytotoxic drugs to agents that target the
special molecular pathology, driving the progression of
'personalized' medicine [1]. The typical representative
for this alternative approach for the treatment of cancer
is imatinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which
left a deep impression on people [2]. For targeted cancer
therapy, small-molecule inhibitors fall broadly into
four categories. They are kinase inhibitors, chaperone
inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and inhibitors

tissues [11]. These suggest that TOPK might be an
excellent drug target for cancer chemotherapy. However,
there is still no TOPK inhibitor in clinic use. There are two
TOPK inhibitors, HI-TOPK-032 [14] and OTS964 [15],
reported in 2012 and 2014 respectively. However, because
of the solubility and toxicity of the two compounds, there
would be a long way for them to be used clinically.
In this study, structure based virtual ligand screening
method was employed to screen the FDA-approved drug
database and pantoprazole (PPZ) was identified as a TOPK
inhibitor.

with Y264, respectively. Also, the pyridine ring of the
compound may form the π-π stacking interaction of the
benzene ring of F197.
To validate the finding of the virtual ligand
screening, we employed microscale thermophoresis
method (MST) to assay the binding affinity between
the compounds and TOPK. This technology detected
fluorescent changes of molecules during thermophoresis,
to quantify protein-protein interactions or proteinsmall molecule interactions with high sensitivity and
low sample cost. Among four compounds assayed,
pantoprazole exhibited the lowest equilibrium dissociation
constant (Kd) of 24.2± 2.32 μM (Table 1, Figure 1A, 1B,
Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B, 1C), which meant the
strongest binding. The binding of pantoprazole was also
stronger than that of HI-TOPK-032, a previously reported
TOPK inhibitor (Table 1, Figure 1C).

RESULTS
Virtual ligand screening identifies the binding of
pantoprazole to TOPK
Due to the absence of the crystal structure of TOPK
or its closely related homologue, a homology model
of human TOPK was constructed by using the X-ray
structure of the IRAK-4 kinase (PDB code: 2NRU) as
the template, which has 29% of sequence identities to
the human TOPK and 2.0 Å resolution of the structure.
The model generated was used for subsequent molecular
docking. In the docking calculation, the binding site was
assigned across the entire structure of TOPK, and was
determined with the lowest-energy and the most favorable
orientation of the ligand. Over 2924 approved drugs and
nutraceuticals from ZINC Drug Database were screened
in silico. Four compounds (Table 1) exhibiting significant
mfScores (more negative better) and docking well into
the active site of the enzyme were selected for further
biological evaluation. The mfScore here represents the
independent score of the strength of inhibitor-enzyme
interaction. Pantoprazole was shown to have the best
docking score. From the generated docking model,
hydrogen bonds were predicted between the sulphone
oxygen of pantoprazole with K213, phenyl ether oxygen

Pantoprazole inhibits EGF-induced anchorageindependent growth of JB6 Cl41 cells
The chemical structure of pantoprazole is shown in
Figure 2A. To determine the cytotoxicity of pantoprazole,
different concentrations of the drug were used to treat
JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cells (JB6 Cl41cells) for 24
h. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTS assay and the
results indicated that pantoprazole had no cytotoxicity
toward JB6 Cl41 cells up to 100 μM at 24 h (Figure 2B).
Next, we investigated whether pantoprazole had an effect
on anchorage-independent growth of JB6 Cl41 cells.
Anchorage-independent growth ability is a hallmark of
in vitro transformed cells and cancer cells. Our results
revealed that JB6 Cl41 cells treated with pantoprazole
formed fewer colonies compared with the control cells
treated with only epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Figure
2C). These results showed that pantoprazole could
attenuate EGF-induced anchorage-independent cell
growth and was not cytotoxic in clinically relevant doses.

Based on our previous data showing that
pantoprazole directly binds with TOPK, we adopted an in
vitro kinase assay with histone H3 as substrate to further
confirm that pantoprazole inhibits TOPK activities. The
results showed that phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10)
was substantially attenuated in a dose-dependent manner
after treatment with pantoprazole (Figure 3A). In addition,
we examined whether pantoprazole could suppress

Pantoprazole inhibits anchorage-independent
growth of colorectal cancer cells
Previous studies suggested that TOPK is highly
activated in human colon cancer. We attempted to determine
whether pantoprazole could affect anchorage-independent
growth of colon cancer cells. We used three colon cancer
cell lines HCT 116, SW480 and WiDr with high, middle
and low expression level of TOPK, respectively (Figure
4A). To determine the cytotoxicity of pantoprazole,

10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 μM gentamicin. The cultures were maintained at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 incubator for 14 days, and the

different concentrations of the drug were used to treat
colon cancer cell lines HCT 116, SW480 and WiDr for 48h,
respectively (Figure 4B). Cytotoxicity was measured by
MTS assay and the results indicated that pantoprazole had
different cytotoxicities toward different colon cancer cells.
HCT 116 cells with high level TOPK were more sensitive
to pantoprazole (Figure 4E). The cells were maintained
with different concentrations of pantoprazole and colony
numbers were counted after culturing for 7-14 days. The
results showed that pantoprazole at 25, 50, 75, 100 μM
and HI-TOPK-032 at 2 μM inhibited colony formation
of WiDr on 0, 8, 5, 15 and 24%; SW480 cells on 27, 27,
50, 62 and 77% and HCT 116 on 20, 40, 51, 67 and 75%
respectively, compared with the non-treated cells (Figure
4C-4E). Overall, our results suggested that inhibitory effect
of pantoprazole on colony formation was significant in
HCT 116 cells with a high expression level of TOPK.

tumor extracts from either group were prepared and
analyzed for phosphorylation of histone H3. The results
of immunohistochemistry analysis showed that expression
of phosphorylated histone H3 was substantially decreased
in the pantoprazole-treated group compared with the
vehicle group (Figure 6D). Overall, our results indicated
that pantoprazole suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting
TOPK activities in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Pantoprazole, an FDA-approved proton-pump
inhibitor, herein is reported to exert antitumor activities
by targeting TOPK. TOPK inhibitors which could benefit
30-40% of CRC patients might represent a new avenue
of investigation for targeted therapy [16]. Therefore, it is
important to find a TOPK inhibitor that could be put into
clinical use as soon as possible.
In the process of new drug development, it is difficult
to move from preclinical screening to clinical trials for its
high cost and low success rate. Drug repurposing is the
process of exploiting new indications for existing drugs
[17]. The supposition of drug repositioning is that these
types of drugs are probably to enter clinical trials faster
and less expensively, because of verified bioavailability
and compatibility. Thus, interests in this strategy have
been growing fast in recent years. For example, Orlistat,
an FDA-approved anti-obesity drug, was found to
inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis
by suppressing several new targets. As a result, this
compound, as well as other orlistat like analogues, has
been proposed as potential anticancer drugs [18].
Structure based virtual ligand screening has
emerged as an effective way to find lead compounds
for given targets in a high-throughput manner with low
cost, while avoiding purchasing thousands of compounds
before obtaining hits [19-22]. The combination of
structure-based virtual ligand screening and drug
repositioning thus represents an efficient method to
find new drugs. In order to find out new inhibitors of
TOPK that might be applied clinically immediately, we
performed structure based virtual ligand screening against
ZINC Drug Database by a homology model of human
TOPK. Over 2924 approved drugs and nutraceuticals
from ZINC Drug Database were screened and four
drugs were found to be potential inhibitors. We further
confirmed that pantoprazole, a FDA-approved protonpump inhibitor (PPI), was an effective TOPK inhibitor.
Pantoprazole bound specifically with TOPK and inhibited
its activities. The binding between pantoprazole and
TOPK was even stronger than that with the known TOPK
inhibitor HI-TOPK-032. Compared with HI-TOPK-032
and OTS964, pantoprazole has much lower cytotoxicities
(Supplementary Figure 2). All these tend to imply
that pantoprazole is at least a good lead compound for
designing novel TOPK inhibitors.

Knocking down TOPK attenuates the
inhibitory effect of colon cancer cell growth by
pantoprazole
In addition, to investigate whether the effects
of pantoprazole are mediated directly through TOPK,
we compared the effects of HCT 116 cells transfected
with a shMOCK or shTOPK plasmid (#1-#5) (Figure
5A). Pantoprazole suppressed anchorage-independent
growth in shMOCK cells but had less effects in
shTOPK cells (Figure 5B). Western blot results showed
that TOPK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3
(Ser10) was substantially decreased time dependently
with pantoprazole treatment (Figure 5C). These results
suggested that TOPK is a direct target for pantoprazole to
suppress colon cancer cell growth.

Pantoprazole suppresses tumor growth by
inhibiting TOPK activity in vivo
Based on our previous data, the next step was to
determine whether pantoprazole could suppress tumor
growth in vivo. After injecting HCT 116 cells into nude
mice, and then the mice were divided into two matched
groups. Treatment was started after two days of cells
injection. The first measurable tumors were observed on
day 11. The results indicated that tumors treated with
100 mg/kg pantoprazole grew significantly more slowly
and the size of tumors was smaller compared with the
vehicle group (Figure 6A). On day 19, the average tumor
volume per mouse treated with 100 mg/kg pantoprazole
was 111mm3 while that was 285mm3 in the vehicle
group (Figure 6B). The average body weights of either
group were similar throughout the study (Figure 6C),
which indicated that the dose of pantoprazole used for
the experiment had no toxicity to the mice. To further
determine whether the antitumor effect of pantoprazole
was associated with its inhibition of TOPK activities,

Pantoprazole is a standard treatment for gastric
acid-related diseases and Helicobacter pylori infection
together with antibiotics [23]. Besides targeting the
gastric acid pump, PPIs inhibit activities of V-ATPase
[24]. Recent studies reported that the pretreatment of
PPIs increased sensitivities of drug-resistant cancer cells
to cytotoxic drugs, such as melanomas [25], lymphomas
[26] and gastric adenocarcinomas [27, 28]. There are also
some data providing the proof of the concept that PPIs
may be used as antineoplastic agents, but the underlying
mechanisms is far from conclusive. Pantoprazole as
a proton-pump inhibitor, is a prodrug, which requires
protonation for functional activation under acidic
conditions, accumulated selectively in acidic gastric
luminal space, and ultimately inhibits acid secretion by
covalently binding to cysteine residues in α-subunit of
H+/K+-ATPase [29-30]. However, in this study, cells were
treated in medium with pH 7.2-7.4, not in acid condition.
It is strongly implied that pantoprazole inhibits tumor
growth by its prodrug form.
Previous studies showed that TOPK was a novel
serine-threonine kinase that was a member of MAPKK
family. TOPK was involved in many cellular functions,
including tumor development, cell growth, apoptosis, and
inflammation [31-33]. During mitosis, kinase activities of
TOPK is elevated, and TOPK promotes phosphorylation
of histone H3, PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1),
GPSM2 [G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotidebinding protein) signaling modulator 2], and p97 proteins
that are essential for the completion of cancer cell
cytokinesis [34-36]. Therefore, it is likely that TOPK
phosphorylates various protein substrates that are essential
for cancer cell survival and proliferation, particularly in
the mitotic phase of cell cycle.
Consistent with reported studies, our results
indicated that the phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10)
in vitro and in vivo were both strongly reduced by
pantoprazole (Figure 3A-3C, Figure 5C). Notably, the
phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) was inhibited in
vivo in pantoprazole–treated tumor tissues (Figure 6D).
In conclusion, we provided evidences showing
that pantoprazole effectively suppressed anchorageindependent cell growth of colon cancer cells with high
expressed TOPK levels, and suppressed in vivo tumor
growth of HCT 116 cells by inhibiting TOPK activities.
Overall, our findings offer an alternative therapy for
colorectal cancer by targeting TOPK with pantoprazole.

maintained in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 7-14 days,
and the cell colonies were scored as described above.

With the crystal structure of the IRAK-4 kinase
(PDB code: 2NRU) as the template, a homology model
of human TOPK (accession number: NP_060962)
was constructed by using MODELLER (an automated
homology modeling program) [38-39]. The subset zdd
(ZINC Drug Database), which included all commercially
available approved drugs and nutraceuticals worldwide,
was downloaded from ZINC as mol2 files, which were
used as input for docking [40]. The docking was performed
by using ICM 3.8.1 modeling software on an Intel i7 4960
processor (MolSoft LLC, San Diego, CA) [41]. Ligand
binding pocket residues were selected by using graphical
tools in the ICM software, to create the boundaries of
the docking search. In the docking calculation, potential
energy maps of the receptor were calculated using default
parameters. The compounds were imported into ICM and
an index file was created. The conformational sampling
was based on the Monte Carlo procedure, and finally the
lowest-energy and the most favorable orientation of the
ligand was selected.

In vitro kinase assay
Inactive histone H3 proteins were used as the
substrate for an in vitro kinase assay with active TOPK.
Firstly, active TOPK was incubated with pantoprazole
(50 and 100 μM) in 1 × kinase buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 5 mM b-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM
MnCl2) at 32°C for 15 minutes. Then inactive histone H3
and 100 μM ATP were added to reaction and incubated at
32°C for 1.5 h. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 × SDS
sample buffer and then were analyzed by Western blot.

Western blot analysis
The harvested cells were lysed with lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mg/mL aprotinin, 10 mg/mL
leupeptin, 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyluoride (PMSF),
1 mM dithiolthreitol (DTT) containing 1% Triton X-100).
Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000
rpm for 15 minutes, and protein’s content was determined
using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, USA). Lysate protein
(20-40 μg) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and
electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (PVDF) (Millipore, USA). The membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk or 5% BSA for 1 h
and then incubated with the respective specific primary
antibody at 4°Covernight. Protein bands were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL
Plus) (GE Healthcare, USA) after hybridization with a
HRP conjugated secondary antibody. Band density was
quantified using the Image J software program (NIH).

MTS assay
To estimate cell viability, mouse epidermal JB6
Cl41, human colon cancer HCT 116, SW480, and WiDr
cells (1000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The attached cells were
fed with fresh medium containing various concentrations
of pantoprazole (0-100 μM) for additional 24 h and 48
h. After culturing for various times, the cytotoxicity
of pantoprazole was measured using an MTS assay kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All the
experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean
absorbance values were calculated. The results are
expressed as the percentage of inhibition that produced
a reduction in absorbance by pantoprazole treatment
compared with the non-treated cells (control).

Isolation of histone H3
Histones were extracted from cells by disrupting the
cells with NETN buffer [150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% nonionic detergent IGEPAL
CA 630(NP-40), Sigma]. The insoluble fraction was
pelleted for 5 minutes in a microcentrifuge (8,400 rpm).
Nuclei were extracted with 0.1 M HCl to isolate the total
histones. The samples were precipitated with 1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.0) and then resuspended in ddH2O.

Anchorage-independent cells transformation
assay (Soft agar)
Mouse epidermal JB6 Cl41 cells (2.4 × 104) were
exposed to EGF (20 ng/ml) and treated with pantoprazole
(0-100 μM) in 1 mL of 0.3% Basal Medium Eagle (BME)
agar containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 25 μg/
mL gentamicin. The cultures were maintained at 37°C, in
a 5% CO2 incubator for 7-14 days, and the cell’s colonies
were scored using a microscope Motic AE 20 (China) and
the Motic Image Plus computer program. To estimate the
effect of pantoprazole on colony formation, colon cancer
cells HCT 116, SW480, and WiDr (2.4 × 104) were treated
with pantoprazole (0-100 μM) in 1 mL of 0.3% Basal
Medium Eagle (BME) agar containing 10% FBS, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. The cultures were

In vivo xenograft mouse model
Non-obese
Diabetic/Severe
Combined
Immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice were purchased
from Beijing HFK Bioscience CO., LTD (Beijing, China).
The animals were maintained under ‘specific pathogenfree’ conditions according to the guidelines established
by Research Animal Resources, Laboratory Animal

22470

Oncotarget

Center, The Fourth Military Medical University (China).
The mice were randomly divided into two groups: (i)
vehicle group (n=8); (ii) 100 mg/kg pantoprazole-treated
group (n=8). The experiment was repeated with HCT
116 colon cancer cells. HCT 116 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously (5×106 cells) into the left flank of each
mouse in the two groups. Treatment was started after
two days of cells injection. For the pantoprazole group,
2.5 mg pantoprazole, formulated in 200 μl physiological
saline, was administered to each mouse every two days by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. For the vehicle group, 200
μl physiological saline was administered to each mouse
every two days by i.p. injection. The duration of the
animal study was 19 days for HCT 116 cells. The tumor
volume was calculated from measurements of 3 diameters
of the individual tumor based on the following formula:
tumor volume (mm3) = (length × width × height × 0.52).
The mice were monitored until tumors reached 1 cm3 total
volume, at which time the mice were euthanized and the
tumors were extracted. The tumors were dissected and
sent for immunohistochemical analysis at the Department
of Pathology in Xijing Hospital (The Fourth Military
Medical University, China). All animal experiments
were performed following the protocols approved by the
Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical
University.
