Abstract
Estrogen treatment of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells allows
the reinitiation of synchronous cell cycle progression in
antiestrogen-arrested cells. Here, we report that progestins
also reinitiate cell cycle progression in this model. Using clonal
cell lines derived from progesterone receptor (PR)–negative
MCF-7M13 cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of PRA
and PRB, we show that this effect is mediated via PRB, not
PRA. Cell cycle progression did not occur with a DNA-binding
domain mutant of PRB but was unaffected by mutation in the
NH2-terminal, SH3 domain interaction motif, which mediates
rapid progestin activation of c-Src. Thus, the progestininduced proliferative response in antiestrogen-inhibited cells
is mediated primarily by the transcriptional activity of PRB.
Analysis of selected cell cycle targets showed that progestin
treatment induced levels of cyclin D1 expression and retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation similar to those
induced by estradiol. In contrast, progestin treatment resulted
in only a 1.2-fold induction of c-Myc compared with a 10-fold
induction by estradiol. These results support the conclusion
that progestin, in a PRB-dependent manner, can overcome the
growth-inhibitory effects of antiestrogens in estrogen receptor/
PR-positive breast cancer cells by the induction of cyclin D1
expression. The mediation of this effect by PRB, but not PRA,
further suggests a mechanism whereby abnormal regulation of
the normal expression ratios of PR isoforms in breast cancer
could lead to the attenuation of antiestrogen-mediated growth
arrest. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8942–51]

Introduction
Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor antagonist (SERM), has
been the endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of breast
cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone
receptor (PR)–positive tumors. A significant limitation of tamoxifen therapy is intrinsic and acquired resistance (1). This has led to
the development of alternative and potentially more efficacious
endocrine therapies, including pure antiestrogens and aromatase
inhibitors. The pure steroidal antiestrogen, ICI 182780 ( fulvestrant,
‘‘Faslodex’’), displays no demonstrable estrogen agonist activity and

is potentially more efficacious than tamoxifen (2), and is as effective as the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole (3), in postmenopausal
women with advanced breast cancer.
ICI 182780 is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation in ERpositive, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in which it induces quiescence
(4). Growth arrest is preceded by a decline in c-Myc expression, a
consequent decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels, and decreased
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk4 and Cdk2) activity (4, 5). Studies
investigating the role of ICI 182780 in the inhibition of breast
cancer cell proliferation have focused mainly on ERa-mediated
effects in breast cancer cell lines (6). However, ER has a functional
relationship with PR in modulating many physiologic responses in
target tissues, including the control of cell proliferation in both the
breast and uterus (7), with evidence that progestins can enhance
breast cancer risk (8, 9). Furthermore, high expression of ER and
PR is a marker of therapeutic responsiveness and patient outcome
in breast cancer (10, 11).
PR is expressed in most target tissues as two isoforms, PRA and
PRB, transcribed from a single gene with distinct estrogeninducible promoter regions (12). The first NH2-terminal 164 amino
acids of PRB are absent in PRA. This unique NH2-terminal region of
PRB mediates a transactivation function that contributes to the
differential binding of cofactors and to the distinct properties of
the two isoforms (13–16). PR is an estrogen-induced protein, and in
some breast cancer cell lines, estrogen activation of ER preferentially stimulates PRB expression (17). Conversely, PRA can antagonize ER action and suppress the activity of PRB (13).
Target tissues for progesterone express both PRA and PRB
(7, 18), but when expressed separately, PRA and PRB mediate both
distinct and overlapping transcriptional responses (19), resulting in
different physiologic effects in different target tissues (20). Selective
ablation of PRA or PRB showed that PRB, but not PRA, was
sufficient for normal mammary gland development in mice (21, 22).
In the normal human breast, PRA and PRB have similar but low
levels of expression (23), being expressed in f30% of nonproliferating breast epithelial cells (24). In the progression from normal
to malignant breast cells, the expression of PRA and PRB becomes
more heterogeneous, with more aggressive breast cancers being
associated with a predominance of either one of the two PR
isoforms (23). Differential isoform expression is associated with
different phenotypes. For example, overexpression of PRA in breast
cancer cells resulted in an aberrant progestin response leading to
loss of cell adhesion (25), whereas increased expression in the
mammary gland of transgenic mice resulted in excessive side
branching and disruption of normal gland architecture (26).
Alternatively, increased PRB expression has been linked to cell
proliferation in patients with breast cancer (27), whereas in mice,

excess PRB induced lobulo-alveolar hyperproliferation (28). Consequently, altered PRA/PRB ratios might play a role in the etiology
of breast cancer, and the detection of differential expression of
PRA and PRB may be an important marker in breast cancer
development, progression, and therapeutic responsiveness.
In the present study, we show that progestins can reinitiate cell
cycle progression in antiestrogen-arrested cells. Furthermore, this
effect is mediated by PRB and not PRA, and is dependent on a
functional DNA-binding domain, implying that the effect is
mediated primarily via PRB-mediated gene transcription.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Steroid solutions, prepared in absolute ethanol and stored at
20jC, were obtained from the following sources: ORG2058 [16a-ethoxy21-hyhroxy-19-norpregn-4-en-3, 20-dione] (Amersham); R5020 [17a21-dimethyl-19-norpregn-4,9-diene-3,20-dione] (Du Pont, Ltd.); RU486
[17h-hydroxy-11h-(4-methylaminophenyl)-17a-(1-propynyl)-etra-4,9-diene3-one] (Dr. J-P. Raynaud of Roussel-Uclaf, France); ICI 182780 (Faslodex)
[7a-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluropentyl-sulfinyl)nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17hdiol] and 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( from Dr. Alan Wakeling, Astra Zeneca
Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, Cheshire, United Kingdom).
Construction of the retroviral PR vectors. Constructs for retroviral
expression were made using the pQCXIP vector (BD Biosciences) which was
first converted to the Gateway system (Invitrogen) by cloning the Gateway
Cassette RfA into the blunted BamHI site of pQCXIP to generate
pQCXIPgat. PRA and PRB and mutant constructs (PRBDSH3, PRADSH3,
PRBC587A, PRAC587A) were cloned into KpnI/NotI sites of entry clone2b and
subsequently transferred into pQCXIPgat via the LR reaction.
To block the expression of PRA the PRA transcriptional start site atg
was mutated to gcg in all PRB constructs using the Quick-Change II kit
(Stratagene; ref. 29). This also introduced an NruI site at this position
(PRBM165A). The primer sequences used were NruI minus (cttgcacccggcggctcgcgagcggggacaaca) and Nru I plus (tgttgtccccgctcgcgagccggtccgggtgcaag). All PR sequences were verified by sequence analysis to
ensure the fidelity of the constructs.
Cell culture. MCF-7-PR and MCF-7-BDSH3 cell lines have been described
previously (30). Stock cultures of MCF-7 and T-47D cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and insulin (10 Ag/mL). MCF-7PR
cell lines were supplemented with 0.5 Ag/mL of zeocin and MCF-7M13-PR
supplemented with puromycin (2 Ag/mL; Invitrogen). For experiments
investigating the effects of ICI 182780, six-well dishes were seeded at
1.5  105 cells/well in RPMI plus 5% FCS and supplemented with insulin
(10 Ag/mL). After 24 h, ICI 182780 (10 nmol/L) was added directly to the
medium. Cells were treated with hormones and harvested at the times
indicated.
Cell kinetic studies. At the completion of the experiments, cells were
harvested for assessment of cell cycle phase distribution using flow
cytometry as described previously (31). A minimum of 20,000 cells were
counted for each sample. Analysis was done with ModFit software.
Retroviral infection of MCF-7M13 cells. MCF-7M13 cells, a PRnegative clone of the MCF-7 cell line, were transfected with the murine
ecotropic receptor and selected for expression using geneticin (400 Ag/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich). Subsequently, MCF-7M13EcoR cells were infected with PRA,
PRB, and various PR mutant retroviral constructs using methods described
previously (31).
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were prepared for protein extraction as
previously described (31). Protein was quantitated using the Bio-Rad assay
and equal amounts of total protein (20 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE
then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation with the following primary antibodies: 1294/H9, a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes
both human PRA and PRB isoforms (32); cyclin D1 (DCS-6; Novacastra
Laboratories, Ltd.); c-Myc-C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti–phosphoretinoblasma protein (Rb) (phospho-Ser780; Sigma Aldrich); and Rb (G3-245;

PharMingen). Protein abundance was quantified by analysis of autoradiographs using densitometry (Molecular Dynamics).
Indirect immunofluorescence. PR expressing MCF-7M13 cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS in four-well chamber slides
and incubated for 24 h. The following day, cells were treated with ethanol
or ORG2058 (10 nmol/L) for 8 h. After hormone treatment, cells were
paraformaldehyde-fixed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in
PBS and incubated with a PR-specific monoclonal antibody (1294/H9) in
1% bovine serum albumin-FCS. The nucleus was defined by staining with
4¶-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the cytoskeleton ( filamentous actin) was
stained using TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma Aldrich). Slides were mounted using
80% glycerol.
Digital images were collected using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope
(40 objective). Using the ‘‘Image J’’ software package (33), a linear profile
across the diameter of the cell measured the fluorescence intensity of PR in
the cytoplasm and nucleus and the relative ratio of PR (nucleus/cytoplasm)
for each cell treated with ORG2058 (10 nmol/L) or vehicle was determined.
An average of 30 to 40 cells per cell line was analyzed.

Results
Progestins stimulate cell cycle progression in antiestrogenarrested T-47D but not in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Previous
studies have shown that progestins can both stimulate and inhibit
cell cycle progression in T-47D and MCF-7 cells (34, 35). Because
ICI 182780 treatment induces growth arrest with features of
quiescence (4), we initially assessed the effect of progestins on ICI
182780–arrested cells to determine whether the stimulatory effect
of progestins could override antiestrogen-mediated growth arrest.
T-47D and MCF-7 cells that express endogenous ER and PR were
equally responsive to ICI 182780 treatment, with the proportion of
S phase cells declining from 25% to 30% in control, vehicle-treated
cells to 10% after 36 h of ICI 182780 treatment (Fig. 1A and B). ICI
treatment alone substantially down-regulated PR in both cell types
(Fig. 1C). Initial PR levels were higher in T-47D; thus, some PR
remains detectable in these cells 21 h post–ICI 182780 treatment,
whereas PR is down-regulated to undetectable levels in MCF-7 cells
within 8 h (Fig. 1C).
Addition of the synthetic progestin, ORG2058 (10 nmol/L) to
T-47D cells in the continued presence of ICI 182780 (10 nmol/L),
resulted in an initial transient acceleration of cell cycle progression
(increase in S phase from 10% to 20%) 12 to 18 h posttreatment,
followed by a return to pretreatment levels at 24 h (Fig. 1A). The
PR, still present in ICI 182780–treated T-47D cells, was further
down-regulated 8 h post-ORG5058 treatment and was barely
detectable by 21 h (Fig. 1C). The transient proliferative response
was abrogated by the antiprogestin RU486, which alone had no
effect on cell cycle phase distribution under these conditions
(Fig. 1B). No further down-regulation of PR in ICI 182780–treated
cells was observed with RU486, and RU486 abrogated ORG2058
down-regulation of PR (Fig. 1C), supporting the idea that cell cycle
progression and down-regulation of PR were mediated through
progestin binding. In contrast, no cell cycle response to ORG2058
was observed in ICI 182780–arrested MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B). In these
cells, ICI 182780 treatment down-regulated PR to undetectable
levels (Fig. 1C), presumably precluding progestin action and the
ability to initiate PR-mediated cell cycle progression in the
presence of ICI 182780.
To test whether this phenomenon was shared by other structural
classes of estrogen antagonists, we arrested T-47D cells with the
SERMs, tamoxifen and clomiphene, and treated these cells with
ORG2058 48 h later. As with ICI 182780–arrested cells, progestin
treatment reinitiated cell cycle progression (Fig. 1D).

of PRB only from this construct (PRBM165A) was confirmed by
Western blot (Fig. 2B). It was previously shown that progestins
could mediate their effects via both ‘‘classical’’ PR-mediated
transcription and rapid ‘‘non-classical’’ effects mediated via an
interaction between a proline-rich domain in the NH2 terminus
(polyproline SH3 recognition motif, amino acids 421–428), and
SH3-type 1 domains of selected signaling molecules including
members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (30). To distinguish
the transcriptional effects of PR from c-Src (SH3)–mediated effects,
we generated both DSH3 and zinc finger mutants (C587A) of PR
(Fig. 2A) which were stably expressed in MCF-7M13 cells.
Protein expression and cellular localization of these ectopically
expressed PRs in MCF-7M13 cells were determined by immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescent microscopy. PR was not
detected in vector-transfected MCF-7M13 cells (Fig. 2B), whereas
wild-type PRA, PRBM165A, and PR mutants were expressed at
similarly high levels, comparable to endogenous PR in T-47D cells,
one of the most widely employed in vitro models of progestin
action. We verified that the DSH3 PR variants were transcription-

ally active using a PRE-luciferase reporter construct (data not
shown). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that >70% of cells
expressed detectable levels of PR. As shown in Fig. 2C, PRA and
PRB have distinct intracellular distribution in the absence of ligand:
PRBM165A and PRBM165A/DSH3 were localized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, whereas PRA and PRADSH3
proteins were predominantly nuclear. Interestingly, disruption of
the DNA-binding domain (PRAC587A and PRBM165A/C587A) caused
localization of PRB and PRA to the cytoplasm and nucleus with
similar intensity (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that an intact zinc
finger and the unique NH2 terminus of PRB (amino acids 1–164)
are important for receptor localization in the absence of ligand.
Nevertheless, we observed nuclear translocation of all PR variants
upon hormone binding (Fig. 2C and D).

cell cycle progression under identical experimental conditions
(Fig. 3A–C). Progestins also reinitiated cell cycle progression in
cells expressing PRB mutated at the SH3 domain interaction motif
(PRBM165A/DSH3). In contrast, MCF-7M13 cells expressing PRB with
a mutation in the first zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain
(PRBM165A/C587A) were not released from cell cycle arrest following
ORG2058 treatment (Fig. 3C). We confirmed these results with a
previously described MCF-7 cell line constructed to stably express
wild-type PRB, PRBDSH3, or empty vector (LacZ; Fig. 3D; ref. 30).
In the absence of estrogen, endogenous PR is very low in these
cells, as estrogen induction is required to elicit a progestin
response (30). ICI 182780 inhibition was more effective in these cell
lines than in MCF-7M13 cells (S phase = 5–10%) and progestin
treatment again reinitiated cell cycle progression in cells expressing
either wild-type PRB or PRBDSH3 but not in vector control MCF-7
cells that lack PR (Fig. 3D). Finally, to test that a similar effect was
apparent when cells were arrested with tamoxifen, we conducted
an experiment identical to that described in Fig. 3D following
48 h treatment with 1 Amol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen. As described
previously, tamoxifen was less potent than ICI 182780 in inhibiting
S phase (36). However, the addition of ORG2058 to tamoxifentreated MCF-7 cells expressing either PRB or PRBDSH3 reinitiated
cell cycle progression but had no effect in empty vector cells
(Fig. 3E). Hence, progestin reinitiation of cell cycle progression in
antiestrogen-arrested cells was independent of the ability of PR to
interact with and activate Src.
These data show that in the presence of structurally distinct
antiestrogens, PRB (but not PRA) is sufficient to mediate
stimulation of proliferation by ORG2058 in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the integrity of the first zinc finger in the DNA-binding
domain is essential for progestin activation of cell cycle progression under these experimental conditions, suggesting that reversal

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

of antiestrogen arrest is dependent primarily on the transcriptional
activity of PRB.
Time course of progestin reversal of ICI 182780–mediated
cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 and MCF-7M13 cells stably
expressing PRA or PRB. We next measured the time course of
progestin effects in ICI 182780–arrested MCF-7 and MCF-7M13
cells stably expressing different forms of PR to determine whether
cells expressing PRA constructs initiated a transient proliferative
response not evident at 24 h post-progestin treatment.
The distribution of cells in different phases of the cell cycle was
determined by flow cytometry and the S phase fraction for each of
the cell lines is presented in Fig. 4. In agreement with the data in
Figs. 1 and 3, ICI 182780 treatment reduced S phase from f30% to
f10% at 36 h in all cell lines and no significant changes were
observed in these cells throughout the subsequent 24-h time
course. Progestin did not stimulate MCF-7M13 PRA and PRADSH3
cells, and combinations of RU486 and ORG2058 had no effect at the
time points examined (Fig. 4A).
In contrast, at 12 h, the S phase was increased in PRB-expressing
MCF-7 cells treated with ORG2058. By 21 h, S phase had increased
to f35%, and it remained significantly elevated at 24 h (Fig. 4B).
Over this time period, cells did not show any evidence of an
inhibitory response to progestin, as previously observed in T-47D
cells at later time points (34, 35). In addition, the ORG2058stimulated proliferative response was significantly enhanced in
MCF-7 PRB cells compared with T-47D cells (f35–40% S phase
compared with 20%, respectively; compare Fig. 1A–Fig. 4B
and C). The antiprogestin RU486 abrogated this ORG2058stimulated cell cycle progression. Progression from G0/G1 to S
phase in ICI 182780–pretreated MCF-7 PRB cell lines was also
observed 21 h after treatment with the synthetic progestin R5020
and this proliferative effect was repressed by RU486, as shown in

Fig. 4C. MCF-7 PRBDSH3 cells yielded results essentially identical to
MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type PRB (Fig. 4B and C).
Effects of ICI 182780 on estrogen-regulated genes in breast
cancer cells overexpressing PRB. The mechanisms of antiestrogen arrest of MCF-7 cells are well documented (4–6), as are the
responses to estradiol (E2) in antiestrogen-arrested cells (6). To
elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in progestin release
from ICI 182780 inhibition, we first investigated whether the
presence of unliganded PR could influence the effects of ICI 182780
on the levels of selected cell cycle regulatory proteins with a known
role in estrogen/antiestrogen-regulated cell proliferation. Constitutive expression of PRB and PRBDSH3 in the absence of progestin
did not affect the efficiency of ICI 182780–mediated growth arrest
(Fig. 5A). Because early events in the growth-inhibitory response to
ICI 182780 include down-regulation of ER and the cell cycle targets
c-Myc and cyclin D1, we determined if increased PRB or PRBDSH3
expression influenced ICI 182780 regulation of these target genes.
As shown in Fig. 5B, ICI 182780 treatment resulted in the downregulation of ER expression by 55% to 70% in MCF-7 and T-47D
cells, and this was independent of constitutive expression of PR
in MCF-7 cells. In agreement with previously published data (6),
ICI 182780–treated cells showed a significant decrease in c-Myc
protein levels (>90%) in both cell lines, which was also independent

of constitutive PR expression (Fig. 5B). Cyclin D1 expression was
also significantly reduced to 30% to 40% of control in MCF-7 and
T-47D parent cell lines, but in MCF-7 cells, constitutive ectopic
expression of PRB or PRBDSH3 attenuated ICI 182780 downregulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. 5B). This did not seem to compromise
the decrease in phosphorylation of Rb at Ser780 in MCF-7 and
T-47D cells (Fig. 5B), characteristic of ICI 182780 treatment (37),
or antiestrogen-induced growth arrest as assessed by decreased S
phase (Fig. 5A).
Effects of estrogen and progestin on PR and ER expression.
Because modulation of ER and PR expression, phosphorylation,
and degradation are documented responses of breast cancer cells
to estrogen and progestin agonists and antagonists (7), we assessed
changes in ER and PR levels and phosphorylation in our models
(Fig. 6A and B). Previous studies have suggested that in ER-positive
cells, progestin-induced cell proliferation was mediated through
an interaction between PRB and ER (38, 39). Thus, we also
investigated the effects of ICI 182780, E2, and ORG2058 on ERa
levels. ORG2058 treatment of T-47D cells resulted in PR phosphorylation, as assessed by decreased electrophoretic motility, and
subsequent degradation, whereas in MCF-7 cells expressing PRB or
PRBDSH3, the characteristic upshift associated with phosphorylation was apparent without a subsequent decline in protein levels,

presumably as a consequence of continuous expression from the
exogenous vector (Fig. 6A and B). In all cell lines, administration of
E2 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in ERa (which depleted ERa,
see Fig. 5) compared with ICI 182780 alone (Fig. 6A and B). This
was unexpected, as in the absence of ICI 182780, E2 down-regulated
ERa (data not shown). In contrast, progestin treatment had no
discernable effect on ERa levels in ICI 182780–pretreated cells.
In summary, estrogen augmented ER expression in ICI 182780–
pretreated MCF-7 and T-47D cells, whereas progestin had no effect
in MCF-7 cell lines.
Both progestin and estrogen stimulate the cyclin D1-Rb
pathway. Cyclin D1 is a key cell cycle regulatory molecule
previously identified as a major target of progestin action in PRpositive T-47D cells (40). Cyclin D1 protein expression was
increased >2-fold after ORG2058 treatment of T-47D cells pretreated with ICI 182780 and this was associated with an increase in
Rb phosphorylation at Ser780 and in total Rb (Fig. 6A), consistent
with previous data in the absence of ICI 182780 pretreatment (41).
By 21 h, levels of cyclin D1 declined in these cells, and remained
at levels similar to control cells pretreated with ICI 182780 alone.
This was concomitant with the decrease in PR expression (Fig. 6B)
and return of S phase to control levels (Fig. 1C). A minor, 1.2-fold

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

increase in cyclin D1 was evident in E2-treated cells at 8 h, and no
change in Rb was observed at this time point (Fig. 6A). However, by
21 h, a >2-fold increase in cyclin D1 and Rb was evident (Fig. 6B).
This delay in cyclin D1 induction corresponded with a delay in
cell cycle re-entry from G0/G1 phase to S phase compared with
progestin-treated cells (data not shown).
Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein were up-regulated by progestin
treatment f2-fold by 8 h in MCF-7 cells constitutively expressing
ectopic PRB or PRBDSH3 (Fig. 6A; data not shown) and this increase
was maintained at 21 h (Fig. 6B) in the presence of ORG2058 and
ICI 182780. A similar 2-fold increase in cyclin D1 expression was
observed in E2-treated cells at 8 and 21 h in all cell lines examined
(Fig. 6A and B). Cyclin D1 induction, through estrogen or progestin
stimulation, was associated with increased phosphorylation of
Rb at Ser780 (Fig. 6A and B). No significant increases in cyclin D1
expression or Rb phosphorylation were observed in progestintreated MCF-7 cells that lack PR expression (LacZ control cells).
Differential regulation of c-Myc by progestin and estrogen.
c-Myc is a key regulator of steroid-induced cell proliferation in
both MCF-7 and T-47D cells (6, 40). In ICI 182780–arrested T-47D
cells, treatment with ORG2058 increased expression of c-Myc by
f2.8-fold at both 8 and 21 h, whereas a >5-fold increase was
observed following E2 treatment at the same time points (Fig. 6A
and B). This increase in c-Myc was maintained in ORG2058-treated
T-47D cells (Fig. 6B), although the fraction of S phase cells had
returned to ICI 182780–treated levels at this time (see Fig. 1A and
C). In contrast, levels of c-Myc were maintained or slightly
increased at 21 h in estrogen-treated cells concurrent with an
increase in S phase (Fig. 6B and C).
In MCF-7 cells stably transfected to constitutively express PR,
the addition of estrogen to ICI 187280–arrested cells significantly
increased c-Myc levels as early as 2 h (data not shown) and these
elevated levels (>10-fold) were maintained at 8 and 21 h in all
MCF-7 cell lines (Fig. 6A and B). ORG2058 treatment caused only a
minor increase of c-Myc expression in ICI 182780–arrested MCF-7
cells at 8- and 21-h time points (<2-fold; Fig. 6A and B). These data
support a key role for cyclin D1/Rb in progestin reinitiation of
cell cycle progression in ICI 182780–arrested breast cancer cells,
whereas c-Myc seems to be less important. In contrast, estrogeninduced cell cycle progression of ICI 182780–arrested cells is
associated with increased expression of both c-Myc and cyclin D1
(Fig. 6).

Discussion
Acquired resistance to antiestrogens is a major issue in breast
cancer management, but the mechanisms underlying antiestrogen
insensitivity are not fully defined (1). Normal cell proliferation in
the breast is regulated by estrogen and progesterone, acting via
their cognate receptors, and breast cancer is linked to the
disruption of receptor expression and function. The pure
antiestrogen ICI 182780 is effective in initiating and maintaining
cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells by rapid degradation of ER,
decreased expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, and exit from the cell
cycle (4–6). Because PR is an estrogen-regulated gene, one of
the possible positive outcomes of ER depletion is that endogenous
PR is also depleted, and hence, PR-mediated activation of cell
proliferation is reduced. However, our results clearly show that
when endogenous PR was highly expressed, e.g., in T-47D cells, ICI
182780 did not totally deplete PR, and progestins could reinitiate
cell cycle progression.

Progestin Reversal of Antiestrogen Arrest

Of potential clinical importance is the observation that aberrant
expression of PRA and PRB is symptomatic of hormone-dependent
breast cancers (23). When we examined the effects of progestin in
antiestrogen (ICI 182780 or SERM)–treated breast cancer cells,
we observed that PRB, but not PRA, could mediate a significant
proliferative response. Interestingly, constitutive expression of
PRB in MCF-7 cells not only allowed the progestin-proliferative
response in the presence of ICI 182780, but also enhanced and
prolonged S phase entry compared with T-47D cells. We propose
that this effect is a direct consequence of high PRB expression and
is consistent with the observations that PRB is essential for
mammary development, proliferation, and differentiation, whereas
PRA is not (20) and that carriers of the PR +331 A allele, which
leads to increased expression of PRB, are at increased risk of breast
cancer (27). Hence, aberrant PRB expression may have a causative
role in breast cancer development and/or progression, or in the
context of this study, decrease the ability of antiestrogens and other
endocrine treatments to maintain growth arrest in patients with
breast cancer. The latter hypothesis is not consistent with a study
of PR isoform expression in tamoxifen-treated patients in whom a
high PRA/PRB ratio, predominantly caused by high PRA levels, was

associated with early patient relapse (42). However, expression of
high levels of PRA alone confer a more invasive phenotype on
breast cancer cells which may, in part, explain these findings (25).
Clearly a more extensive analysis of the potential role of PR isoform
expression in breast cancer prognosis and response to therapy is
warranted but is currently impeded by the lack of isoform-specific
antibodies suitable for assessment of expression in the context of
tamoxifen response.
A PR mutant with a disabled DNA-binding domain was unable to
mediate the progestin-induced reinitiation of cell cycle progression
in antiestrogen-arrested cells, whereas mutations in the NH2terminal, SH3 domain interaction motif had no effect on this
response. Thus, progestin stimulation of antiestrogen-arrested cells
is mediated primarily by the nuclear transcriptional activity of PR
and not by its rapid activation of c-Src signaling. This result
contrasts with previous studies (43, 44) showing that rapid
progestin-induced activation of the Src/mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, mediated by PR interaction with
SH3 domain of c-Src, was required for progestin induction of cyclin
D1 expression and cell cycle progression. One possible explanation
for this apparent discrepancy is that progestin treatment in the

present context occurred in a mitogen-rich environment (i.e., in the
presence of whole serum, endogenous growth factors, and insulin),
whereas the previous studies (43, 44) were conducted under growth
factor–depleted conditions. Thus, progestin/PR-dependent induction of cell cycle progression may be mediated through multiple
pathways and mechanisms dependent on the cellular environment.
An alternative mechanism by which progestins can mediate rapid
activation of Src/MAPK pathways has been reported to occur
through a preformed PR/ER/Src complex, in which the progestin
signal is transmitted to Src through unliganded ER (38, 39).
However, in previous studies, cell lines were employed that lacked
ER and only expressed various PRs, suggesting that PR activation of
Src/MAPK through direct coupling of PR with SH3 domains is
sufficient to mediate cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation in
the absence of ER (44). Because most target tissues express both
ER and PR, and estrogens and progestins can each induce rapid
activation of Src/MAPK (45), an important unresolved issue is how
ER and PR integrate with cytoplasmic signaling pathways. In
previous studies (38, 39), antiestrogens blocked progestin-induced
activation of Src/MAPK and proliferation in cells that express both
ER and PR. However, in the present study, progestin reinitiated
cell cycle progression in the presence of antiestrogen in cells that
express both ER and PR. Thus, the mechanism(s) and role that
progestin/PR–induced rapid activation Src/MAPK plays in cell
proliferation remains to be more completely defined.
Previous studies have shown that the regulation of cyclin D1 and
cyclin E–activated cyclin-dependent kinases plays a critical role in
exit from quiescence and the deregulated cell cycles of cancer cells
(46), and that cyclin D1 is a critical element of progestin regulation
of breast cancer cell proliferation (31, 40, 41). The introduction of
PRB into MCF-7 cells compromised ICI 182780 down-regulation of
cyclin D1; however, the phosphorylation of Rb decreased and cells
ceased to proliferate. In concordance with previous reports,
reactivation of the cyclin D1-Rb pathway was sufficient to reinitiate
cell cycle progression. Moreover, progestin treatment had little
effect on c-Myc expression and no effect on ER expression. In
contrast, estrogen treatment was associated with significant
increases in c-Myc and cyclin D1 expression and accelerated

transition of cells from G0/G1 phase to S phase. Although the
mechanisms underlying the progestin-induced release from antiestrogen inhibition are not well-defined and need to be further
studied, we propose, based on the present results, the existence of
two independent but interconnecting pathways of hormonemediated cell cycle progression for progestins and estrogens in
breast cancer cells. Progestins and estrogens both stimulate cyclin
D1 expression, and hence, activate the cyclin D1-Rb pathway,
whereas estrogen also stimulates cells by reactivation and
maintenance of ER and c-Myc expression, which further activates
the Rb pathway via cyclin E/Cdk2 (47).
In conclusion, we propose that the potential of breast cancer
cells to become desensitized to antiestrogen inhibition may be
dependent in part on the total and relative abundance of PR
isoforms. If the responses documented here also operate in vivo,
circulating hormones present in premenopausal women or as
part of hormone replacement therapy regimens have the
potential to stimulate cell cycle progression in cells that express
high levels of PRB. Furthermore, high PRB in the presence of
progestins can attenuate growth arrest induced by antiestrogens.
This could have major clinical implications in the treatment of
hormone-dependent breast cancer with endocrine agents targeting ER. However, our data showing that this effect of progestin is
blocked by the progestin antagonist, RU486, suggests that some
progestin antagonists (48, 49) might have therapeutic utility in
this context.
