Abstract
Centrosomes are central regulators of mitosis that are often amplified in cancer cells. Centrosomes function
both as organizers of the mitotic spindle and as reaction centers to trigger activation of Cdk1 and G2/M
transition in the cell cycle, but their functional organization remains incomplete. Recent proteomic studies have
identified novel components of the human centrosome including Cep63, a protein of unknown function that
Xenopus studies have implicated in mitotic spindle assembly and spindle inactivation after DNA damage. Here,
we report that human Cep63 binds to and recruits Cdk1 to centrosomes, and thereby regulates mitotic entry.
RNAi-mediated Cep63 depletion in U2OS cancer cells induced polyploidization through mitotic skipping.
Elicitation of this phenotype was associated with downregulation of centrosomal Cdk1, mimicking the
phenotype induced by direct depletion of Cdk1. In contrast, Cep63 overexpression induced de novo centrosome
amplification during cell-cycle interphase. Induction of this phenotype was suppressible by cell treatment with
the Cdk inhibitor roscovitine. In a survey of 244 neuroblastoma cases, Cep63 mRNA overexpression was
associated with MYCN oncogene amplification and poor prognosis. In cultured cells, Cep63 overexpression was
associated with an enhancement in replication-induced DNA breakage. Together, our findings define human
Cep63 as a centrosomal recruitment factor for Cdk1 that is essential for mitotic entry, providing a physical link
between the centrosome and the cell-cycle machinery. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2129–39. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Centrosomes function as microtubule-organizing centers
and mitotic spindle poles, directing the formation of bipolar
spindles (1, 2). To ensure spindle bipolarity, centrosomes
normally duplicate precisely once per cell cycle, which occurs
in parallel with DNA replication and is mediated by Cdk2 (1–
6). Centrosome amplification has been frequently observed in

both solid and hematologic malignancies and has been linked
to tumorigenesis (7). Both the preferred mechanism leading to
and the relevant consequences of centrosome amplification
are still controversial. Although Cdk2-dependent de novo
synthesis of supernumerary centrosomes in interphase has
been repeatedly postulated, centrosome amplification might
alternatively result from polyploidization due to mitotic
defects, or centrosomes might become fragmented (e.g., after
DNA damage) rather than amplified (8–14). Moreover, a
centrosome inactivation checkpoint has been postulated
where amplification (or fragmentation) of centrosomes in
response to DNA damage leads to elimination of damaged
cells via mitotic catastrophe (8–12). On the other hand, in
most cases, centrosome amplification does not induce widespread multipolar mitoses due to clustering of multiple
centrosomes into a bipolar spindle array (15, 16). Rather,
amplified centrosomes lead to low-level chromosomal
instability caused by increased chromosome missegregation
rates (17).
Centrosomes serve as reaction centers where key regulators
meet to control cell-cycle transitions (8, 18). In particular, the
G2/M transition is initiated by the activation of cyclin
B1–Cdk1 at centrosomes, which is stimulated by Cdc25B and
Aurora A but inhibited by centrosomal Chk1 (19–23). Similarly,
cyclin E has been shown to localize to centrosomes, thereby
promoting S-phase entry (24). Spatiotemporal orchestration of

centrosome and DNA replication cycles with mitotic events are
essential for both proper cell proliferation and maintenance of
chromosomal integrity (1, 2, 8).
In a mass spectrometry–based proteomic screen for novel
centrosomal components, Cep63 was among the most
abundant newly identified proteins (25). In a study on
Xenopus mitotic egg extracts, Cep63 was shown to be targeted by ATM- and ATR-dependent phosphorylation, leading
to inactivation of centrosome-dependent spindle assembly in
response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 26). Our
present study documents the first functional analysis of
Cep63 in mammalian cells. We describe a novel function
of Cep63 in recruiting the key mitotic kinase Cdk1 to centrosomes and report on chromosomal instability and ploidy
aberrations in human cells with disbalanced levels of Cep63,
including cancer-associated overexpression that correlates
with poor patient prognosis.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction
Transcript variant 3 of Cep63 was provided by E.A. Nigg,
variant 2 was purchased from ImaGenes (clone ID:
IRALp962H1854Q2), other variants were produced by RTPCR from BJ cells. All cDNAs were cloned into pEGFP-C1
(BD Biosciences Clontech). For stable transfection, pEGFPCep63 (transcript variant 3) was cloned into a modified
pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) vector whose selection cassette
was changed from zeocin to puromycin.
Cell culture, cell lines, and siRNAs
EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (provided by L.
Savelyeva), KE-37, and CCRF-CEM cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (Gibco) and other cell lines were cultured in DMEM (PAA
Laboratories Inc.), each supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Biochrom) and antibiotics. Cell line contaminations
were excluded according to published methodology (27).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a healthy donor and
a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were
obtained by gradient centrifugation (Biocoll, 1.077 g/mL;
Biochrom). Transfections were done using Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen), Dharmafect (Thermo Scientific), or Fugene 6
(Roche). T-Rex-U2OS cells (Invitrogen) stably expressing
GFP-Cep63 inducible by 1 mg/mL tetracycline was generated
using a modified T-REx system (Invitrogen). The following
siRNAs were used: 50 -GGCUCUGGCUGAACAAUCAdTdT-30 ,
targeting exon 6 of Cep63, 50 -gaacuucgucauccaaauadTdT-30 ,
targeting Cdk1, and 50 -UAAGGCUAUGAA GAGAUACdTdT-30 ,
targeting luciferase.
Antibodies
A GST-fusion peptide corresponding to exons 2 to 8 of
Cep63 expressed from pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences)
was used to generate a mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibody (DCS
390) by standard hybridoma technology, which showed specificity for immunostaining, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation (Figs. 1B and C and 2A; Supplementary Figs. S2B,
E, S3A, and S7). Other antibodies used were mouse mono-

Laboratories), Cdk1 (clone 17; Santa Cruz), centrin (20H5;
provided by J.L. Salisbury), Cep170 (77–419; provided by E.A.
Nigg), C-Nap1 (clone 42; BD Transduction Laboratories); GFP

pericentrin (ab4448; Abcam), phospho-Ser10 histone H3
(Upstate #06–570), and a rabbit monoclonal to Myc-tag
(71D10; Cell Signaling).
Immunofluorescence, metaphase spreads, and live cell
imaging
Standard protocols were applied for immunofluorescence
of cells grown on coverslips or collected by cytocentrifugation
(Shandon Cytospin 3) and for metaphase spreads. Fluorescence microscopy was done using Zeiss Axiovert 200 M, LSM
510 and LSM 710 (Zeiss Application Center) microscopes
equipped with A-Plan 10/0.25, Plan-Neofluar 40/1.3,
Plan-Neofluar 100/1.3, and Plan-Apochromat 63/1.4 objectives and Zeiss AxioVision and ZEN 2008 software. Time-lapse
video microscopy of cells grown on m-Dishes (Ibidi #81166 or
#80136) was carried out at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2, using a Zeiss Cell Observer (DKFZ Light
Microscopy Facility) or the Nikon BioStation IM system
(Nikon Imaging Centre).
Microinjection
Microinjection of siRNAs (final concentration 25–80 mmol/
L) and rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran (average mol wt
20,000; Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration 0.5%, w/v) was
conducted on an Olympus IX70 microscope with a semiautomatic Eppendorf microinjection system (Microinjector 5242
and Micromanipulator 5171). All experiments included Cep63siRNA and control luciferase siRNA–injected cells in 2 distinct
areas on the same dish featuring a grid pattern to relocate
injected cells. All injected cells were individually traced to
determine cell fates. Cell sizes were measured after manual
delineation of cell boundaries using, AxioVision 4.7.2 software
(Zeiss).
Quantification of centrosomal proteins
Using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Zeiss
Application Center), 3-dimensional confocal data sets from a
defined volume containing the centrosome (verified by
g-tubulin staining) were collected under standardized settings. The volume of signals exceeding a standardized
threshold was calculated using AxioVision 4.7.2 software
(Zeiss).
GST pulldown assay, immunoprecipitation, centrosome
extraction, and immunoblotting
The cDNA of Cdk1 (transcript variant 3, encoding isoform 1)
cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) was subjected to
in vitro transcription/translation with 35S-labeling by using the
TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro GST

Results
Cep63 is a constitutive centrosomal protein
Consistent with the initial report (25), transiently expressed
GFP-Cep63 almost exclusively localized to centrosomes in
several cell lines, with no differences among isoforms (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2A). Since quantitative RT-PCR
revealed that among the 4 known transcript variants variant
3 was most abundant (Supplementary Fig. S1B), we used this
variant to generate U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-Cep63 in
a tetracycline-dependent manner and found GFP-Cep63 virtually exclusively localized to centrosomes in all cell-cycle
phases (Fig. 1A). Immunostaining with a mouse monoclonal
antibody revealed that endogenous Cep63 almost exclusively
localized to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle in all cell
lines tested (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). This
pattern remained unaltered upon microtubule disruption
(Supplementary Fig. S2D), confirming Cep63 to be a constitutive centrosomal protein. The centrosomal localization was
verified by examining centrosome extracts, and in a panel of
human normal, immortalized, and tumor cell lines, endogenous Cep63 was always present, with 2 prominent bands
corresponding to isoforms 2 (63 kDa) and 3 (58 kDa) on
immunoblots (Fig. 1C). In immunofluorescence analyses,
the number of Cep63 signals regularly matched the number
of g-tubulin or pericentrin signals, respectively (Fig. 1A, B,
and D). Detailed colocalization analysis by laser scanning

microscopy revealed that GFP-Cep63 mostly localized within
the region positive for g-tubulin and pericentrin while showing a partial overlap with C-Nap1 but only little overlap with
centrin and Cep170 (Fig. 1D), indicating that Cep63 is a
centrosomal but probably not core centriolar protein.
Cep63 downregulation induces polyploidization due to
mitotic skipping
Using a siRNA targeting all known isoforms of Cep63
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Figs. S2E and S3A and B), we
depleted Cep63 in U2OS cells and found a striking accumulation of giant cells (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S3C). By 72
hours posttransfection, flow cytometry revealed a significant
increase of cells with more than 4N DNA from 3.5%  0.4%
in luciferase-siRNA–treated cells to 11.0%  2.0% after
treatment with Cep63-siRNA (P ¼ 0.019; mean  SD of 3
independent experiments). When only cells with 8N DNA
were counted, this increase was likewise significant (P ¼
0.021) with 1.6%  0.3% of cells after luciferase-siRNA but
6.3%  1.3% of cells after Cep63-siRNA harboring 8N DNA
(Fig. 2B). This phenotype was confirmed by using an alternative siRNA against Cep63 (Supplementary Fig. S3D and E;
Supplementary Table S1). Polyploidization was further confirmed by a significant increase (P ¼ 0.010) of metaphases
harboring diplochromosomes to 4.0% 1.0% (mean 
SD of 3 times 100 metaphase spreads) 72 hours after treatment with Cep63-siRNA, a 12-fold increase compared with
0.3%  0.6% of metaphases after control luciferase-siRNA
(Fig. 2C).
To differentiate between skipping of mitosis, failed
mitosis, or cell fusion underlying polyploidization, we
conducted time-lapse video microscopy after direct microinjection of siRNA to Cep63 into U2OS cells. In repeated
sessions using a variety of conditions and compassing up to

www.aacrjournals.org

72 hours postmicroinjection, we observed neither cell
fusions nor increased rates of aberrant or failed mitoses
in Cep63-depleted cells compared with cells injected with
luciferase-siRNA. Instead, the majority of mitoses seemed
normal and a subset of Cep63 siRNA–injected cells displayed enlargement without intervening mitoses consistent with mitotic skipping (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Video
S1). Quantification in 478 injected cells revealed a highly
significant decrease of the mitotic rate because of Cep63
depletion (P ¼ 4.44E-13; Fig. 3B). Instead, the proportion of
cells remaining in interphase was highly significantly elevated compared with cells injected with luciferase-siRNA (P
¼ 1.82E-06; Fig. 3B). Whereas proliferation resulted in an
increased amount of control cells, the number of Cep63depleted cells remained stable during the experiments
(Fig. 3C). Consistent with mitotic skipping leading to
endopolyploidization, Cep63-depleted cells remaining in
interphase during observation showed a highly significant
increase in cell size (P ¼ 1.19E-06) whereas luciferasesiRNA–injected controls remaining in interphase displayed
a stable size (Fig. 3D). Notably, 22.7% of all Cep63-siRNA–
injected cells compared with 2.4% of luciferase-siRNA–
injected cells (P ¼ 1.12E-11) showed a more than 1.5-fold
size increase while remaining in interphase, indicating that
after direct microinjection of Cep63-siRNA, the proportion
of cells becoming polyploid is substantially higher than
after conventional siRNA transfection.
Mitotic skipping was further confirmed by live imaging of
microinjected cells released from a thymidine block revealing
that 203 of 320 cells injected with luciferase-siRNA (63%),
but only 57 of 265 cells injected with Cep63-siRNA (22%),
passed through mitosis as expected between 6 and 24 hours
after release (P ¼ 3.02E-24). In addition, Cep63-siRNA–

visualization of mitotic spindles showed no evidence of mitotic aberrations during live imaging (Supplementary Fig. S3F),
and quantification on fixed cells revealed a proportion of
89.8%  6.1% (mean  SD of 4 times 100 mitoses) normal
bipolar mitoses in U2OS cells 72 hours after transfection with
Cep63-siRNA as compared with 96.0%1.4% after control
siRNA (P ¼ 0.13). Overall, several complementary approaches
show that Cep63 depletion leads to inhibition of mitotic entry,
with subsequent polyploidization due to endoreplication in a
subset of cells, and without inducing significant mitotic
aberrations.
Cep63 recruits Cdk1 to the centrosome
Mitosis is initiated by activation of centrosomal cyclin B1–
Cdk1 (19, 21). Lack of Cdk1 activation is associated with
skipping of mitosis and endoreplication (23, 34). Hence, we
asked whether mitotic skipping in Cep63-depleted cells reflects
lack of centrosomal Cdk1. Immunofluorescence revealed a
pronounced decrease of the centrosomal Cdk1 load after
Cep63 downregulation in U2OS cells (Fig. 4A and B). Giant
cells observed after Cep63-siRNA showed notably low levels of
centrosomal Cdk1, consistent with the model that polyploidization after Cep63 depletion results from a lack of centrosomal
Cdk1 (Fig. 4A). A direct interaction between Cep63 and Cdk1
was verified by both coimmunoprecipitation and an in vitro
GST pulldown assay using GST-tagged full-length Cep63

2134

(Fig. 4C and D). Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation failed
to reveal any evidence for an interaction between Cep63 and
cyclin B, A, or E (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Finally, siRNAmediated depletion of Cdk1 led to a polyploidization phenotype virtually identical to that observed after Cep63 depletion
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). We conclude that initiation of
mitosis requires centrosomal recruitment of Cdk1 by Cep63.
Cep63 overexpression induces de novo centrosome
amplification in interphase
We observed increased numbers of cells with supernumerary centrosomes both after transient overexpression of
GFP-Cep63 (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and in U2OS cells
conditionally expressing GFP-Cep63, where centrosome
amplification was detectable by 24 to 48 hours and reached
a maximum about 72 hours after GFP-Cep63 induction,
when a steady state was reached, presumably due to elimination of cells with amplified centrosomes (Fig. 5A and B).
To rule out secondary centrosome amplification due to
polyploidization, we induced GFP-Cep63 for up to 2 weeks,
but no evidence for polyploidization was found (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Time-lapse video microscopy revealed that
Cep63 overexpression was associated with centrosome
amplification occurring during interphase (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Video S2). Regularly, gradual accumulation of
supernumerary centrosomes in a single interphase was

microscopy (Supplementary Video S2). A representative example is marked by arrows. Originating from one mother cell, both daughter cells show de novo
centrosome amplification in interphase followed by mitoses, with supernumerary centrosomes in their daughter cells as well. A centrosome before (*) and after

followed by a normal bipolar mitosis, which is consistent
with centrosomal clustering preventing spindle multipolarity (15, 16, 35). The daughter cells resulting from these
mitoses often harbored amplified centrosomes as well
(Fig. 5C; Supplementary Video S2).
During Cep63 overexpression, the number of centrin signals
often exceeded twice the number of GFP-Cep63 signals,
indicating that centriole overduplication preceded maturation

with recruitment of Cep63 to overduplicated centrosomes
(Fig. 5D). Amplified centrosomes were associated with only
one signal of Cep170, a marker of mature centrioles (36),
further confirming de novo centrosome amplification during
interphase (Fig. 5D).
As Cdk inhibition by roscovitine suppressed centrosome
amplification upon induction of GFP-Cep63 (Fig. 5B), we asked
whether this phenotype was mediated by Cdk1 or Cdk2. Since

Cdk1 overexpression induced centrosome amplification (Supplementary Fig. S5C), centrosomal overrecruitment of Cdk1
likely plays a role in Cep63-induced centrosome amplification.
On the other hand, coimmunoprecipitation indicated that
Cep63 also interacts with Cdk2, although weaker than with

Cdk1 (Supplementary Fig. S5D). Hence, we cannot exclude that
Cdk2 contributes to this phenotype as well. However, we were
unable to confirm a direct interaction with Cdk2 in an in vitro
GST pulldown assay using GST-Cep63.
The N-terminus of Cep63 is necessary and sufficient for
its centrosomal localization and centrosome
amplification
Using GFP-tagged deletion constructs of Cep63, we found
that the N-terminus comprising amino acids 1 to 290 was
necessary and sufficient to promote both the centrosomal
localization of Cep63 and centrosome amplification (Supplementary Fig. S6). Our data indicate that Cep63-induced centrosome amplification depends on the centrosomal
localization of Cep63 and that the common N-terminus of
all 4 known isoforms of Cep63 consisting of amino acids 1 to
309 (Supplementary Fig. S1) harbors the minimal functional
sequence of Cep63.
Cep63 overexpression is associated with aggressive
malignancies and promotes chromosomal breakage
Since Cdk deregulation and centrosome amplification are
likely oncogenic mechanisms, we speculated that Cep63 might
be overexpressed in malignant cells. Indeed, analysis of mRNA
expression data of 244 human neuroblastomas revealed a
correlation between high Cep63 expression levels and
advanced stage (stage 4) of the disease (Fig. 6A). Moreover,
high Cep63 levels were associated with MYCN oncogene
amplification and poor survival (Fig. 6A and B).
In addition to Cdk-dependent centrosome amplification,
Cep63-triggered Cdk deregulation might also impair the DNA
damage response and lead to persistence of unrepaired replication-associated defects in the form of DNA DSBs in mitotic
cells (37–39). We therefore evaluated whether DSB signaling
and frequency might be enhanced in Cep63-overexpressing
cells exposed to replication stress. Indeed, treatment with
aphidicolin, which induces DNA DSBs by inhibiting DNA
polymerases (40), led to an increase in the amount of
g-H2AX, a DSB marker, in metaphases of Cep63-overexpressing as compared with control cells (Fig. 6C). We conclude
that Cep63 overexpression is associated with aggressive malignancies, wherein it might contribute to the aggressive behavior of these tumors by impairing the DNA damage response
and propagation of unrepaired chromosomal breaks.
Figure 6. Cep63 overexpression is associated with aggressive
malignancies and DNA DSBs. A, 244 neuroblastoma patients were
classified according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System
(49), except for cases with MYCN amplification, which were separately
evaluated and, together with stage 4, represent the poorest prognosis
group. Relative expression levels of Cep63-mRNA are given as box plots
where the boundaries represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the
median is indicated by a horizontal line within the box. B, Kaplan–Meier plots
of overall survival of 244 neuroblastoma patients classified according to
their Cep63-mRNA expression level. The optimal cutoff level (10.83091)
between high and low Cep63 expression was determined by log-rank
statistics. C, as indicated, GFP-Cep63 expression was induced with or
without addition of aphidicolin. The g-H2AX signal integrated densities were
quantified by immunofluorescence of at least 100 metaphase spreads per
data bar. **, this difference is significant (P ¼ 0.0023).

Cep63 Recruits Cdk1 to the Centrosome

Discussion
In this study, we show that human Cep63 is a constitutive
centrosomal protein exhibiting a virtually exclusive centrosomal localization throughout the cell-cycle independent of the
presence of microtubules. We show that Cep63 directly interacts with and thereby recruits Cdk1 to centrosomes as a
prerequisite for mitotic entry. Moreover, we show that
Cep63 overexpression leads to de novo centrosome amplification and a link between Cep63 overexpression to aggressive
malignancies and an impaired DNA damage response has
been established.
Cdk1 localizes to centrosomes throughout the cell cycle
where initial activation of the cyclin B1–Cdk1 complex and
subsequent initiation of mitosis occurs (19, 21, 41). Cdk2 has
been described to localize to centrosomes as well (42).
Cyclins A, B1, and E are recruited to centrosomes independently of Cdks via their centrosomal localization signals, the
centrosomal binding partners of which are currently
unknown (24, 43). Consequentially, it is believed but unproven that Cdks are indirectly targeted to centrosomes via
their partner cyclins. Our data for the first time provide
evidence that Cdk1 is directly recruited to centrosomes via
interaction with Cep63. Support for this contention is mani
fold: First, we show that Cep63 and Cdk1 directly interact
with each other whereas no interaction between cyclins and
Cep63 was found. Second, knockdown of Cep63 by siRNA led
to a specific depletion of Cdk1 from centrosomes and
phenocopied direct knockdown of Cdk1 with mitotic skipping and polyploidization.
In a study on Xenopus mitotic egg extracts, Cep63 downregulation induced aberrant mitoses, which was explained
by a lack of centrosomal Cep63 causing inhibition of spindle
assembly during mitosis (26). In mammalian cells, we now
describe that Cep63 depletion suppressed mitotic entry
altogether, which led to mitotic skipping in a subset of cells.
This phenotype was not associated with abnormal mitoses
since in cells where Cep63 was efficiently downregulated, G2
phase was directly followed by endoreplication. However,
analogous to the situation in Xenopus mitotic egg extracts,
depletion of Cep63 prevented successful cell division in
mammalian cells.`
As further evidence for a functionally relevant interaction
between Cep63 and Cdk1, we show that Cep63 overexpression leads to de novo centrosome amplification during
interphase. We have shown that centrosome amplification
can be induced by Cdk1 overexpression and Cep63-induced
centrosome amplification can be suppressed by roscovitine,
and published evidence suggests that Cdk2 is dispensable for
centrosome duplication and amplification (14, 44), which
together support the notion that overrecruited Cdk1 contributes to Cep63-induced centrosome amplification. A weak
interaction between Cep63 and Cdk2, as indicated by our
coimmunoprecipitation data, might additionally contribute
to centrosome amplification when Cep63 is overexpressed
also because Cdk1 and Cdk2 are closely related in structure
(45). We conclude that the interaction of Cdk1 with Cep63
sufficiently explains all observed phenotypes whereas the

www.aacrjournals.org

potential functional link between Cep63 and Cdk2 remains
speculative.
Finally, we show an association of Cep63 overexpression
with aggressive behavior of human neuroblastomas and an
impaired DNA damage response to replication stress, a condition shared by many oncogene-transformed cells and the
majority of human neoplasms (37–39). The increased rate of
DNA DSBs we observed in the presence of aphidicolin might
be explained by elevated Cep63 causing Cdk hyperactivation
and, consequently, an override of checkpoint mechanisms
that normally guard against mitotic entry with unrepaired
chromosomes. In broad terms, this phenotype resembles
other types of Cdk deregulation such as Chk1 inhibition or
overexpression of the oncogenic Cdc25A phosphatase (46, 47).
An alternative mechanism about how overexpressed Cep63
contributes to malignant phenotypes may be centrosome
amplification leading to chromosomal instability
by promoting chromosome missegregation (17). Specifically relating
to MYC oncogene, it has been shown that MYCN overexpression in neuroblastoma cells induces centrosome hyperamplification after induction of DNA DSBs (48).
In summary, our data identify Cep63 as a centrosomal
recruitment factor for Cdk1 and may help to better understand both the centrosomal regulation of mitotic entry and
the phenomenon of centrosome amplification, which is common in malignant cells, presumably underlying cancer-associated chromosomal instability (7, 17). In addition, Cep63induced centrosome amplification might be part of the centrosome inactivation checkpoint, a proposed backup checkpoint mechanism promoting mitotic catastrophe (2, 7, 9–12).
Moreover, we identify a link between Cep63, oncogenesis, and
the DNA damage response in human cells, which extends and
complements the established role of Cep63 in the regulation of
centrosome-dependent spindle assembly after DNA DSBs in
Xenopus (26).
