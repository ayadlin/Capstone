ABSTRACT
The efficient gene transfection, cellular uptake and targeted delivery in vivo
are key issues for non-viral gene delivery vectors in cancer therapy. To solve these
issues, we designed a new targeted gene delivery system based on epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) targeting strategy. An anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody h-R3
was introduced to dendriplexes of PAMAM and DNA via electrostatic interactions to
form self-assembled h-R3-PAMAM-DNA complexes (h-R3-dendriplexes). Dendriplexes
h-R3-dendriplexes represented excellent DNA encapsulation ability and formed unique
nanostructures. Compared to dendriplexes, h-R3-dendriplexes presented lower
cytotoxicity, higher gene transfection efficiency, excellent endosome escape ability
and high nuclear accumulation in the EGFR-overexpressing HepG2 cells. Both ex
vivo fluorescence imaging and confocal results of frozen section revealed that h-R3dendriplexes showed higher targeted delivery and much better gene expression in
the tumors than dendriplexes at the same N/P ratio, and h-R3-dendriplexes had
accumulation primarily in the tumor and kidney. Moreover, h-R3-dendriplexes for
p53 delivery indicated efficient cell growth inhibition and potentiated paclitaxelinduced cell death. These results indicate that the h-R3-dendriplexes represent
a great potential to be used as efficient targeted gene delivery carriers in EGFRoverexpressing tumor cells.

modified polymers have been synthesized and evaluated
in vitro by several authors, however, the efficiency of them
is low and nonspecific in vivo [17, 18].
In order to improve selectivity and efficiency of
the vector, nonviral systems have been conjugated with
a variety of ligands, such as transferrin [19, 20], folate
[21, 22], EGF [23] and antibody [24]. These modification
ligands are mostly incorporated to the polymer vectors
through chemical reactions, which are difficult to keep
the bioactivity of the ligands [25, 26]. Thus, a better
approach is needed to increase the transfection efficiency
and maintain the bioactivity for the polymer mediated

INTRODUCTION
The success of gene therapy for nonviral vectors
depends on how efficiently the vectors can delivery
therapeutic genes into target cells and high efficiency geneexpression in vivo [1–7]. The major approach in nonviral
gene therapy is based on cationic polymers, which can
mediate the delivery of DNA and RNA [8–14]. Among
of theses polymers, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) offers
such a nontoxic, nonimmunogenic and biocompatible
gene carrier system. Many groups have used this polymer
for gene delivery [15, 16]. Also, new PAMAM-derived

gene transfection at the same time. Compared to chemical
modification, molecular self-assembly is a convenient
strategy for making nano-complexes with remaining the
bioactivity of the biomacromolecule [27].
Nimotuzumab (h-R3) is a humanized monoclonal
antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain
of the EGFR and inhibits EGF binding. H-R3 has been
approved in several countries for the treatment of head
and neck tumors, and is in clinical trials for various tumor
types including cervical, colorectal, prostate, glioma,
pancreatic, esophageal, and breast cancer [28–30].
Furthermore, one important advantage of using h-R3 in the
clinic is the absence of severe adverse effects [31]. This
makes the receptor as an attractive target for anticancer
therapy.
With above-mentioned studies in mind, we
investigate that the addition of the h-R3 to PAMAM
mediated gene delivery system may increase the cellular
uptake due to specific interactions between h-R3 and EGF
receptors on tumor cells resulting in high transfection
efficiency. To test this hypothesis, we prepared selfassembled h-R3-dendriplexes via electrostatic adsorption
of PAMAM-DNA complexes to negatively charged
antibody h-R3. Three different cell lines (EGFRnegative 293T, EGFR-expressing MCF-7 and EGFRoverexpressing HepG2) were used for in vitro experiments.
The formulation, size, zeta potential, morphology and
cytotoxicity of dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes were
evaluated by agarose gel retardation assay, dynamic light
scattering, transmission electron microscopy and MTT
assay. The in vitro gene transfection, cell uptake, ex vivo
distribution and gene delivery were detected by flow
cytometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM),
fluorescence imaging and confocal observation of frozen
section. To test the potential of such novel gene delivery
system in cancer gene therapy, we further investigated this
h-R3-dendriplex system in p53 delivery against EGFRoverexpressing HepG2 and tested the efficacy.

h-R3-dendriplexes via electrostatic adsorption of
PAMAM-DNA complexes to negatively charged h-R3
were designed. H-R3-dendriplexes can bind to the EGFR
of EGFR positive tumor cell membrance. Then, the proton
sponge effect caused by PAMAM dendrimer leads to
lysosomal damage which can protect the DNA from the
degradation in the lysosomes.

Characterization of h-R3-dendriplexes
In this study, the formulation of dendriplexes and
h-R3-dendriplexes with different N/P ratio and different
h-R3/DNA ratio was also assessed by the agarose gel
retardation assay and the results are shown in Figure 2a
and Figure 2b. When the N/P ratios were reached 10, the
dendriplexes were able to completely bind DNA (Figure
2a). However, for h-R3-dendriplexes with a N/P ratio of
20 (Figure 2b), h-R3-dendriplexes could not completely
prevent DNA from migrating into the gel when the weight
ratio of h-R3/DNA was 5, indicating that, in order to
bind DNA completely, the weight ratio of h-R3/DNA
should be less than 5. This result could be explained by a
competition in the interaction between anionic DNA and
negative antibody h-R3 with the positive PAMAM.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was employed
in order to characterize the hydrodynamic size and zeta
potentials of dendriplexes. The particle sizes of different
complexes were measured as shown in Figure 2c. All
sizes of dendriplexes at different N/P ratios were less
than 250 nm, which indicated DNA could be effectively
condensed by PAMAM at the N/P ratio higher than 10.
As compared with the sizes of dendriplexes, the sizes of
h-R3-dendriplexes at the same N/P ratio slightly increased.
This is due to the fact that the negatively charged h-R3
was attached to the surface of dendriplexes, leading to
the increased sizes. The particle sizes of nanoparticles
have a significant impact on its delivery properties [34].
In order to investigate the effect of adding the targeting
ligand on the sizes of dendriplexes, we compared the sizes
of the h-R3-dendriplexes with increased h-R3/DNA ratio
(Figure 2e). When the h-R3/DNA ratio increased, the sizes
of h-R3-dendriplexes slightly increased.
A positive surface charge facilitates dendriplexes
binding to the negatively charged cell surface, but
excessive positive charge can lead to non-specific binding
and significant toxicity [35]. The zeta potentials of the
various complexes are shown in Figure 2d. The zeta
potentials of dendriplexes were positive, when the excess
PAMAM and the strong electrostatic interactions between
dendriplex and h-R3 in the systems could form h-R3dendriplex and the free h-R3 could be ignored. The zeta
potentials of the dendriplexes increased with increasing
N/P ratio when the N/P ratio was less than 10. Compared
with dendriplex, the zeta potential of h-R3-dendriplex
at the same N/P ratio decreased, because the negatively
charged h-R3 was attached to the surface of dendriplexes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Formulation of h-R3-dendriplexes
Amino-terminated PAMAM dendrimers with
lower cytotoxicity have been extensively investigated
as gene vectors. PAMAM dendrimers form complexes
with DNA through electrostatic interactions between
negatively charged phosphate groups of the nucleic acid
and positively charged primary amino groups on the
dendrimer surface. As we know, in order to condense DNA
effectively, the dendriplexes for gene delivery usually have
a positive charge on the surface [32, 33]. In the current
study, the positively charged dendriplexes conjugated with
the negatively charged anti-EGFR antibody h-R3 were
designed. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of
the EGFR-based gene delivery system. Self-assembled

The zeta potentials of the h-R3-dendriplexes decreased
when the h-R3/DNA ratio increased (Figure 2e).
The importance of particle shape on delivery
properties is also gaining recognition [36]. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) can provide direct
information on the particle size, shape and morphology.
Figure 2f shows the TEM images of h-R3-dendriplexes.
The formulations confirmed spherical structures with
mean particle size about 240 nm, which is a good
agreement with the hydrodynamic size determined by
DLS, as seen in Figure 2c. And, the size result partially
met the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,
which promotes nanoparticles to accumulate specifically
in tumors [37, 38].

expression, whereas 293T cells have undetectable EGFR
expression (Figure 3a). Based on the results, HepG2,
MCF-7, and 293T cells were generated with high-,
moderate-, and no-EGFR expression, respectively, for
in vitro transfection studies.
Figure 3b showed the transfection efficiency of
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in different
cell lines (EGFR-negative 293T cells, EGFR-expressing
MCF-7 and EGFR-overexpressing HepG2) transfected
with pEGFP-N1 by flow cytometry. In HepG2, the
transfection efficiency obviously increased from 40% to
75% when the h-R3/DNA ratio increased from 0 to 5. And,
the transfection efficiency kept almost the same about 50%
on EGFR-expressing in MCF-7 and slightly decreased
from 85% to 70% in 293T.
The effect of h-R3-dendriplexes on transfection
efficiency could be attributed to zeta-potential and EGFR
signal pathway. When h-R3/DNA weight ratio increased,
the zeta-potential of h-R3-dendriplexes decreased (Figure
2e), which led to low transfection efficiency [39]. So, in
EGFR-negative 293T, the reduced zeta-potential resulted
in lowered transfection efficiency. And, on the other
hand, EGFR signal pathway could promote clathrinmediated endocytosis, which was effective to high

In vitro transfection
In this study, the transfection efficiency of
dendriplexes was taken in EGFR negative cell line
and EGFR-positive cell line. To assess the endogenous
EGFR expression in the different cell lines, we detected
EGFR protein level by western blotting. Among these
cell lines, HepG2 cells have the highest level of EGFR
expression; MCF-7 cells have moderate level of EGFR

transfection efficiency [40]. In EGFR-overexpressing
HepG2, the EGFR signal pathway effect overcomes the
disadvantage in reduced zeta-potential, and a significant
increase in transfection efficiency was observed. The
transfection efficiency of h-R3-dendriplexes in HepG2
is positively correlated with h-R3/DNA weight ratio.
However, at extremely high h-R3/DNA weight ratios
(h-R3/DNA = 5), transfection efficiency decreases. This
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

results could be explained by the fact that the decreased
DNA loading ability when h-R3/DNA weight ratios
reached to 5 (Figure 2b), leading to low transfection
efficiency. And, in EGFR-expressing MCF-7, the
transfection efficiency of h-R3-dendriplex remained the
same when the h-R3/DNA ratio increased. This may
be attributed to the combination effect of reduced zetapotential and EGFR signal pathway.

gene expression in the cytoplasm [42, 43]. To verify
whether DNA escaped from the endosome/lysosome
with the delivery of PAMAM-DNA, we incubated
dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes with HepG2 cells
at 37°C, and examined the localization of DNA in cells
by staining the acidic organelles (including endosomes
and early lysosomes) with LysoTracker™ Green after
24 h of culture. As shown in Figure 5a, CLSM results
indicated that after 24 h of incubation, the dendriplex
was mainly colocalized with the LysoTracker™ Green
stained organelles (arrows in Figure 5) , suggesting that
dendriplexes still resided in the endosomes or early
lysosomes. However, it was clearly shown that incubation
of cells with h-R3-dendriplexes resulted in separate
localization of red and green fluorescence inside the
cells, with minimal co-localization, which demonstrated
that DNA appeared to have escaped from the lysosomal
vesicles. Fewer obvious yellow regions and more red
regions were observed in the cells treated with h-R3dendriplexes compared to dendriplexes. It was indicated
that more h-R3-dendriplex were distributed in the cells
and released into cytoplasm while not in the endosomes.
The results above may be due to the modification of
h-R3, which facilitated the dendriplexes escape from the
endosomes. Overall, the h-R3 conjugated dendriplex had
excellent cellular uptake and endosome escape ability.
Nuclear translocation of the released DNA from
the cytoplasm is crucial for effective gene delivery
[44]. Figure 5b shows the intracellular localization
of dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes after 24 h
of incubation in HepG2 cells. The cell nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342. The results showed
that incubation of cells with dendriplexes resulted in
separate localization of red and blue fluorescence inside
the cells, with few colocalizations (pink), and, h-R3dendriplexes were mainly colocalized with the nuclei.
Using the h-R3-dendriplex, DNA was transported into the
nucleus with greater colocalization, indicating increased
levels of translocation into the nucleus.

The cytotoxicity of different dendriplexes in EGFRoverexpressing HepG2 was evaluated by MTT assay. As
seen in Figure 4a, the percentage of cell viability was
reduced with the increase of N/P ratio in both dendriplexes
and h-R3-dendriplexes. However, as compared to
dendriplexes, the viability of treated with h-R3dendriplexes was increased relatively at each N/P ratio. As
we know, during the gene transfection, the positive charge
on the surface of dendriplexes is essential for binding the
negatively charged cell membranes and thus being taken
up via an endocytic mechanism [41]. However, the higher
positive surface charge means higher cytotoxicity of the
dendriplexes, and the high cytotoxicity of the polycations
limits their clinical applications as gene vectors. One of
the strategies to reduce the cytotoxicity is to neutralize
or partially shield the positive charge. In this study, h-R3
was used to partially neutralize the positive charge of
dendriplexes. The h-R3-dendriplexes showed relatively
lower zeta potential as compared with dendriplexes
(Figure 2e), which resulted in their lowered cytotoxicity.
Figure 4b showed the Effect of h-R3 on cytotoxicity of
h-R3-dendriplexes with the increased h-R3/DNA ratio.
The cell viability significantly decreased when the h-R3/
DNA reached to 2 or 5, which can be explained by the
fact that the present of h-R3 in h-R3-dendriplexes had the
inhibition effect on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2,
as shown in Figure 4c. These results revealed that the h-R3dendriplexes also had the potentials for tumor therapy.

Cellular uptake
The cellular uptake of dendriplexes and h-R3dendriplexes was evaluated by CLSM after 24 h
culturing with HepG2 cells. In this experiment, Cy5labeled PAMAM were synthesized and employed to
prepare dendriplexes. It is well known that the lysosomal
escape of DNA and siRNA is crucial for the subsequent

observed at 24 h. To determine the more detailed information
on the fluorescence intensities of tumors, region-of-interest

had better gene delivery efficiency and high targeted delivery
than dendriplexes.
As seen in Figure 6d and Figure 6e, ex vivo imaging
results and fluorescence intensities of five major organs

and kidney, with only little fluorescence intensity in liver,
spleen, lung and heart. These results seem very interesting
for tumor-targeted gene delivery; while nanoparticles were
mostly prefer to accumulate in liver and spleen due to the
mononuclear phagocyte system [45]. The Anderson group
also presented the similar results that molecularly selfassembled nucleic acid nanoparticles accumulated primarily
in the tumor and kidney at 12 h post-injection by ex vivo
fluorescence image [4]. The accumulation of dendriplexes
in the kidneys indicated that they were excreted with the
urine. In addition, the fluorescence signal at the tumor site
was approximately double than that in the liver or lung 24 h
after injection of h-R3-dendriplexes (Figure 6e).
To further evaluate the differences between the
dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes, we used CLSM to
observe the complexes distribution in tumor. As shown in
Figure 6f, h-R3-dendriplexes exhibited stronger fluorescence
signals than dendriplexes group. These CLSM results are in
accordance with the ex vivo results in Figure 6b and Figure
6c. Therefore, the more notable signals of Cy5 in h-R3dendriplexes were probably due to the enhanced cellular
uptake and endosome escape ability as discussed in Figure 5a.

or inactivated in most human tumors [47]. Delivering p53
effectively is most important to tumor therapy. As shown in
Figure 7a, expression of p53 at mRNA in HepG2 cells was
detected by RT-PCR. The results represented appreciable
alterations in p53 mRNA levels after transfection with h-R3p53-PAMAM compared to naked p53, h-R3-PAMAM and
h-R3-DNA-PAMAM samples. Expression of GAPDH was
used as an internal control to demonstrate equal loading of
RNA samples. To evaluate cell proliferation, we used MTT
assays (Figure 7b and Figure 7c). An efficient inhibition of
cell proliferation was observed after treatment with h-R3p53-PAMAM complexes for 6 h and subsequent incubation
of up to 24 h or 48 h, relative to the naked p53 plasmid,
h-R3-PAMAM, h-R3-DNA-PAMAM complexes as well
as untreated sample. And, the result also showed that the
increased p53 concentration led to high cell inhibition.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is the first-line chemotherapeutic drug
used for treating cancer in the clinic. PTX blocks mitosis
by impairing spindle function [48], a tumor-suppressing
mechanism totally different from that of p53, and the
interaction between PTX and p53 remains to be clarified.

combination of p53 and PTX. Upon combined treatment of

significant inhibition of growth of HepG2 cells. Our results
provided evidence that p53 gene transfected with h-R3dendriplexes could enable better effect of low-concentration
PTX, which can be a potential auxiliary cancer therapy.
To assess whether apoptosis accounted for the loss of
viability, we examined the expression by FACS analysis.
An increase in cell population in the apoptotic cells area
was shown in the FACS dot plot graphs (Figure 9a). We
presented the quantitative FACS data for percentage of
apoptotic cells based on DNA fragmentation (Figure 9b).
Quantitation of data demonstrated 5.04%, 30.75%, 9.83%,
8.55% and 51.59% apoptotic cells after treatment with
naked p53, h-R3-p53-PAMAM, PTX, combination of PTX
and naked p53, and combination of h-R3-p53-PAMAM
and PTX, respectively (Figure 9b). Results showed that
h-R3-p53-PAMAM had higher apoptotic cells than p53,
and indicated the treatment with combination of PTX
and h-R3-p53-PAMAM caused more apoptosis in HepG2
cells than either treatment alone. The concomitant with
an increase in PTX-induced cell apoptosis compared to
treatment with either h-R3-p53-PAMAM complexes alone
or PTX alone made cause to cell inhibition (Figure 8).

other reagents were obtained from the Biodee Reagent
Company (Beijing, China).

Collecting the same amount of the different
cells (293T, HepG2 and MCF-7), cells were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS, homogenized on ice for
30 minutes in 10 volumes lysis buffer containing 20
mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton-X100 and 1 mM PMSF.
The homogenate was centrifuged at 15, 000 rpm for
30 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and
stored at -20°C. Protein content was determined by
the NanoDrop 2000c. From each sample preparation,
50 μg of total protein was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE
and then transferred to PVDF blotting membranes. The
total protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting
with indicated antibodies following SDS-PAGE
analysis. Immunoblots were performed using rabbit
monoclonal primary antibodies specific for EGFR
(1:10000, Abcam). After blocking nonspecific binding
with 5% BSA in TBS (pH 7.5) containing 0.05%
Tween-20 (TBST), primary antibodies were incubated
on the membranes for EGFR overnight at 4°C in TBST.
Following five times washes in TBST, each time for five
minutes, and the membranes were incubated for 1 h at
37°C with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
(1:7500). Specific bands for EGFR were identified by
prestained protein molecular weight marker.

Cell culture
293T, MCF-7 and HepG2 cells were obtained from
China Center for Typical Culture Collection (Beijing,
China) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 unit/mL penicillin/
streptomycin. All cell lines were cultivated in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Preparation of dendriplexes and
h-R3-dendriplexes
PAMAM was diluted to an appropriate concentration
in PBS and stored at 4°C until use. PAMAM/DNA
complexes (dendriplexes) were made up by adding the
aqueous solution of plasmid DNA to an equal volume of
PAMAM in PBS at a particular N/P ratio, followed by
incubation for 20 min. The N/P ratio was based on the
calculation of the number of terminal -NH2 groups on
the dendrimer versus the number of phosphate groups
of the DNA. H-R3-dendriplexes were prepared by dropping
the dendriplex aqueous solution to an aqueous solution of
h-R3 of equal volume and then incubating for 20 min.

Size distribution and zeta potential
measurements

In vitro transfections
For transfection, 50000 cells were seeded in 1 ml
of medium in 24-well culture plates and incubated for
overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. After this, the medium
was removed and dendriplex/h-R3-dendriplex opti-MEM
solution (200 μl containing 1 μg DNA) was added to each
well. After incubation for 5 hours, the dendriplex was
replaced and the cells were further incubated for 48 hours
in medium containing 10% FBS. After transfection, cells
were detached by trypsin. Cell suspensions were then
transferred to microtubes and fixed by 0.2 mM EDTA.
The percentage of cells transfected was quantitatively by
flow cytometry using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) machine. Transfection efficiency was calculated
based on the percentage of the cells that expressed pEGFP
(positive cells) in the total number of cells.

Size distribution and zeta potential of the
dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes with different N/P
ratio and h-R3/DNA ratio were measured using a Zetasizer
Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK).
Measurements were performed at a temperature of 25°C
after equilibration for 2 min. All results were the mean of
three test runs.

Agarose gel electrophoresis
Dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes with different
N/P ratio and h-R3/DNA ratio were evaluated by agarose
gel retardation assay. Twenty microliters of complexes
containing solution with 1 μg DNA was electrophoresed
on the 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing ethidium bromide
with Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) running buffer at 110 V
for 30 min. DNA was visualized on a Vilber Lourmat UV
transilluminator.

In vitro cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicities of dendriplexes and h-R3dendriplexes with different formulations were examined
by MTT assay. HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at a density of 10000 cells/well in 200 μl of DMEM
containing 10% FBS. After incubation for overnight, the
dendriplex/h-R3-dendriplex opti-MEM solution (20  μl
containing 0.2 μg DNA) was added into each well.
After 4 h, 200 μl fresh complete DMEM was added,
and transfection proceeded for an additional 44 h in the

Transmission electron microscope (TEM)
The dried specimens were examined with a
Zeiss EM 900 transmission electron microscope at an
acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Electron micrographs
were taken with a slow scan camera (Variospeed SSCCD
camera SM-1k-120, TRS, Moorenweis, Germany).

presence of 10% FBS. Then, 20 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml)
solution was added to each well, and further incubated
for 4 h. Thereafter, the medium was carefully removed
and 150 μl DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the
formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 490
nm by a microplate reader. The cells without co-incubation
with the dendriplexes were used as the control.

The tumor tissues were placed on omnisette tissue
cassettes and rapidly frozen to –20°C. The specimens
were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT)
compound, and cut into 6 mm histology slices by the
cryostat. Each section was picked up on glass slides, and
then covered with coverslip. Finally, frozen sections were
observed using a confocal microscope (LSM 710, Carl
Zeiss, Germany).

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
PAMAM was labeled with Cy5 mono-reactive NHS
ester (Fanbo Biochemicals, Beijing, China). The labeling
reaction and purification of Cy5 labeled PAMAM were
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HepG2 cells
were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well 12 h before transfection.
After the culture medium was changed to opti-MEM, well
incubated dendriplexes (N/P 20:1) and h-R3-dendriplexes
(N/P 20:1, h-R3/DNA 1) solution containing 2 μg DNA
were added into each plate. After 4 h incubation at 37°C
in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, the transfection
solutions were aspirated and substituted with complete
culture medium. After additional 20 h incubation, the
cells were washed with PBS for three times before acidic
late endosome staining with LysoTracker green (Life
Technologies). For confocal laser scanning microscopic
measurements, a laser scanning microscope LSM 710
with Plan-Apochromat 100x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective
(Zeiss, Germany) was used.

RT-PCR for p53 mRNA detection
HepG2 cells were plated in a 6-well plates
(4 × 105 cells per well) and transfected with different
samples (naked p53, h-R3-PAMAM, h-R3-DNAPAMAM and h-R3-p53-PAMAM) for 48 h. Total RNA
was isolated with TransZolTM Up (TransGen Biotech,
Beijing, China). The reverse transcription reaction
was performed using TransScript First-Strand cDNA
Synthesis SuperMix System (TransGen Biotech, Beijing,
China). For detection of p53 transcript, 3 μl cDNA
was used in 20 μl reaction with p53 primers (forward,
5-CTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGAC-3; reverse,
5-TCATTCAGCTCTCGGAACATCTCG-3). GAPDH
primers (forward, 5-GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3;
reverse, 5-GTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3) were
used as a control. The cycling procedure was as follows:
94°C for 5 min, then 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for
30 s, 72°C for 60 s, followed by 72°C for 5 min. A volume
of 20 μl PCR reaction was electrophoresed on a 1%
agarose gel, and the amplified DNA band was visualized
by DuRed (Bridgen Biotech, Beijing, China) staining.

Ex vivo distribution
All procedures of the ex vivo experiments complied
with the standards for use of animal subjects as stated in
the guidelines from Committee on Animal Research in
Tsinghua University. The ex vivo studies were performed
in female BALB/c nude mice from the Experimental
Animal Center (Tsinghua University, Beijing, China).
They were housed under controlled conditions (12 h light/
dark schedule, 24°C) in groups of three mice per cage and
formulation. Tumors were introduced in the armpits of the
nude mice by inoculation with 107 HepG2 cells. Palpable
subcutaneous tumors developed over a period of 14 days.
To monitor dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes ex vivo,
PAMAM was labeled with Cy5 (Fanbo Biochemicals,
Beijing, China). Distribution was assessed by injecting
Cy5-labeled dendriplexes (N/P 20:1) and Cy5-labeled
h-R3-dendriplexes (N/P 20:1, h-R3/DNA 1:1) into tumorbearing mice via the tail vein in a total volume of 200 μl
(containing 10 μg DNA per mouse). The mice were
sacrificed and organs were subjected for ex vivo imaging
by the Kodak in vivo imaging system FX-Pro. The optical
imaging was obtained using Kodak multimodal imaging
system FX-Pro equipped with an excitation bandpass filter
at 630 nm and an emission at 700 nm. Region-of-interests
were circled around the organs, and the fluorescence
intensities were analysed with the Carestream MI SE 5.4.2
software package.

MTT assay for studies of cell growth curve
and therapy efficacy
HepG2 Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at
a density of 10000 cells/well in 200 μl of DMEM
containing 10% FBS. After incubation for overnight,
the samples with different p53 concentration
(2 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml) were added into each well
for transfection. After 6 h, 200 μl fresh complete DMEM
was added (for combined medication study, 5 μg/ml or
10 μg/ml paclitaxel was added together), and transfection
proceeded for an additional 18 h or 42 h in the presence
of 10% FBS. Then, the MTT detection method was
described as Part 2.9.

Apoptosis analysis by annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide (PI) double staining
HepG2 cells were plated in a 6-well plates (4 × 105

Anti-EGFR antibody h-R3 conjugated dendriplexes
as gene carriers were designed in this paper. We
characterized the physicochemical properties (including
DNA loading ability, particles size, zeta potential and
morphology), evaluated in vitro toxicity, gene transfection
efficacy in three cell line (EGFR-negative 293T, EGFRexpressing MCF-7 and EGFR-overexpressing HepG2),
and intracellular uptake. Furthermore, we examined the
ex vivo distribution and gene express of dendriplexes
and h-R3-dendriplexes in tumor-bearing BALB/c nude
mice. Dendriplexes and h-R3-dendriplexes represented
excellent DNA encapsulation ability and formed unique
nanostructures. Compared to dendriplexes, h-R3dendriplexes showed lower cytotoxicity, higher gene
transfection efficiency, greater cellular uptake and high
nuclear accumulation in the EGFR-overexpressing
HepG2 cell line. Moreover, the ex vivo distribution in
the tumors also confirmed that h-R3-dendriplexes had
much better gene delivery efficiency and higher targeted
delivery than dendriplexes. Thus, the modification of
h-R3 with dendriplexes on the surface contributes better
efficiency to DNA delivery in vitro and ex vivo. Also,
h-R3-dendriplexes for p53 delivery represented efficient
cell growth inhibition and potentiated paclitaxel-induced
cell death. Therefore, we believe that h-R3-dendriplex is a
promising targeted gene delivery candidate, especially in
EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells.
