and dependence

Dysregulated activation of the CDK4/6 kinases is a hallmark of most mammary-derived carcinomas. ATP-competitive inhibitors
against this complex have been recently advanced in the clinic and have shown signiﬁcant activity, particularly against tumors
driven by the estrogen receptor (ER). However, resistance to these compounds has begun to emerge often months to years after
their initiation. We investigated potential mechanisms of resistance using cell line models that are highly sensitive to this class of
drugs. After prolonged exposure to the selective and potent CDK4/6 inhibitor LY2835219, clones emerged and several were found
to harbor ampliﬁcation of the CDK6 kinase. Ampliﬁcation of CDK6 resulted in a marked increase in CDK6 expression and reduced
response of the CDK4/6 target, phospho-Rb (pRb), to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Knockdown of CDK6 restored drug sensitivity, while
enforced overexpression of CDK6 was sufﬁcient to mediate drug resistance. Not only did CDK6 overexpression mediate resistance
to CDK4/6 inhibitors but it also led to reduced expression of the ER and progesterone receptor (PR), and diminished responsiveness
to ER antagonism. The reduced ER/PR expression after CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance was additionally observed in tumor biopsy
specimens from patients treated with these drugs. Alternative mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors such as loss of pRb
and cyclin E1 overexpression also exhibited decreased hormone responsiveness, suggesting that the clinical paradigm of sequential
endocrine-based therapy may be ineffective in some settings of acquired CDK4/6 resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Estrogen-driven cell cycle progression in breast cancer is
mediated, in part, through transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1
along with suppression of cell cycle inhibitors, such as p27 and
p21.1–3 These factors also receive inputs from growth factor
signaling cascades such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway
and it has been speculated that such signals might stabilize cyclin
D expression and thereby potentiate resistance to antiestrogen
therapy in breast cancer.4,5 As such, kinase inhibition of the cyclin
D–CDK4/6 complex was developed as a therapeutic approach to
hormone receptor-expressing breast cancer.6–8 This strategy has
shown activity in the form of combinations of ATP-competitive
inhibitors of CDK4/6 together with aromatase inhibition (letrozole)
or estrogen receptor (ER) antagonism (fulvestrant).9–11 Despite the
beneﬁt of this approach clinically, tumor resistance develops in
most patients in the metastatic setting and the basis for this
resistance is unknown. In this study, we investigated mechanisms
of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. We established cell
lines that were chronically exposed to the CDK4/6 inhibitor,
LY2835219 (LY5219, abemaciclib), and identiﬁed ampliﬁcation of
CDK6 as a recurrent event. Overexpression of CDK6 promoted
resistance to several CDK4/6 inhibitors as well as inhibitors of the
ER. The data suggest that mechanisms that bypass the G1–S
checkpoint may mediate resistance to both direct inhibitors of

CDK4/6 and inhibitors whose targets primarily function through
activation of cyclin D–CDK4/6.
RESULTS
Generation of CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells
To identify potential mechanisms of resistance to CDK4/6
inhibitors, we initially characterized the selectivity of the CDK4/6
inhibitor, LY5219, in cells. The compound has been previously
demonstrated to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the CDK4
(half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 2 nM) and CDK6
(IC50 = 9.9 nM) kinases, with CDK9 (57 nM), HIPK2 (31 nM) and DYRK2
(61 nM) being the only other kinases found to be inhibited below
100 nM.8 Given the well-established requirement for intact Rb
expression for the pharmacologic efﬁcacy of this class of
drugs,12,13 we compared the effects of the drug in Rb mutant
and wild-type cells. We found potent inhibition of growth of the
Rb wild-type cells MCF-7 (32 nM) and T47D (60 nM) compared with
the Rb-null MDA-MB-468 cells (644 nM) (Supplementary Figure 1).
These data identiﬁed LY5219 as a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6
kinases in cells at doses below 100 nM.
To generate ER+ cells resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors, we
exposed MCF-7 cells to LY5219 over a span of 21 weeks and
collected the cells that grew out. These cells (designated MCF-7

resistant (MR)) had a signiﬁcantly higher IC50 (231 nM) for
inhibition of proliferation compared with parental cells (27.2 nM)
(Figure 1a). To further conﬁrm the reduced potency of LY5219 in
these cells, we analyzed the cell cycle distribution of drug-treated
cells by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting assay. As expected,
parental MCF-7 cells had a marked decrease in the proportion of
cells in the S phase after 48 h exposure to 100 nM LY5219. By
contrast, there was virtually no effect of the drug on the S-phase
content of MR cells (Figure 1b). To ascertain if the resistance of the
MR cells was speciﬁc to the LY5219 compound, we tested the
growth response of parental and MR cells to other selective
CDK4/6 inhibitors, PD0332991 (palbocicilib) and LEE011 (ribociclib). In both cases, MR cells required signiﬁcantly higher drug
concentrations (6–8-fold) for growth suppression (Supplementary
Figure 2).
To understand whether the resistance of MR cells was due to
changes in the response of CDK4/6 kinases to the drug or a
downstream, Rb-independent mechanism, we examined the
effect of drug on Rb phosphorylation. Parental MCF-7 cells
showed decreases in phospho-Rb (pRb) (S780 and S795) as early
as 4 h with complete loss by 24 h in 100 nM LY5219 (Figure 1c).
Meanwhile, MR cells were unaffected up to 8 h post-dosing and
only showed minor decreases at 24–48 h. Corresponding to these
data, cyclin A2 and cyclin E2 showed decreases in expression by
24 h in parental but not in MR cells. In accordance with these
results, parental cells showed complete inhibition of pRb (S780
and S795) with doses as low as 100 nM LY5219, whereas doses up
to 1 μM did not block Rb phosphorylation in MR cells (Figure 1d).

Taken together, the data suggest that MR cells are resistant to
ATP-competitive CDK4/6 inhibitors in a manner that allows
persistent Rb phosphorylation despite high levels of drug.
High CDK6 expression in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells
As MR cells displayed no change in basal pRb but impaired
sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors, we speculated a component of the
CDK4/6–cyclin D1 complex may be altered in these cells. We
initially performed next- generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT;
Supplementary Table 1) of 450 cancer-associated genes in the MR
and parental cells.14 Nearly all exonic mutations were shared
between the two cell lines with no obvious acquired missense
mutation that might promote drug resistance. We next examined
the levels of expression of components of the CDK4/6–cyclin D1
complex along with known signaling complexes responsible for its
activation in these cells. Most strikingly, we observed a sevenfold
increase in CDK6 mRNA levels in the MR cells, with concomitant
increases in CDK6 protein levels as compared with parental cells
(Figures 2a and b). To understand the basis for the increase in
CDK6 expression, we examined the copy number of the CDK6
locus using ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes
against CDK6 and the chromosome 7 centromere. The analysis
revealed that within the population of MR cells, a fraction showed
increased CDK6 copy number (3–21 copies) as compared with
parental cells (3–6 copies) where no such high-level ampliﬁcation
was observed (Figure 2c). Altogether, the data are consistent with
an acquired ampliﬁcation in the drug target, CDK6, being present
in the MR cells. To ascertain whether this phenomenon was

unique to MR cells, we generated CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cells
in the T47D breast cancer model. As observed for the MR cells,
selective doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors had limited effects on
proliferation and cell cycle progression in T47D-resistant (TR)
cells. Once again, elevated levels of CDK6 mRNA and protein were
also identiﬁed in TR cells in this case together with decreases in
Rb1 expression (Supplementary Figure 3), further supporting the
notion that CDK6 may be susceptible to overexpression in ER+
breast cancers treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors.
Acquired CDK6 ampliﬁcation promotes resistance to CDK4/6
inhibitors
In some instances, overexpression or ampliﬁcation of a kinase has
been associated with heightened sensitivity to inhibitors of that
kinase. However, in this case, CDK6 overexpression was ‘acquired’
in the context of long-term exposure to CDK4/6 inhibitors. To
determine if overexpression of CDK6 contributed to drug
resistance, we suppressed CDK6 levels in these resistant cells
using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against CDK6. Greater than 90%
CDK6 knockdown was conﬁrmed by quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR) (Figure 3a). We found that reducing CDK6
levels close to those found in parental cells restored the sensitivity
of MR cells to LY5219, resulting in comparable IC50s for
proliferation (MCF-7 = 31 nM, MR-sh negative control = 218 nM,
MR-sh CDK6 = 17 nM) (Figure 3b). Moreover, the reduction of
CDK6 levels in MR cells was associated with restored sensitivity of
pRb (S795 and S780) to LY5219 (Figure 3c). These data suggest
that CDK6 overexpression is necessary for MR cells to resist LY5219
treatment.
To ascertain whether CDK6 overexpression is sufﬁcient to
promote resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, we enforced expression
of CDK6 through the use of a constitutive long terminal repeat
promoter in three different ER+ cell lines: MCF-7, T47D and

CAMA-1. After selecting for cells with stable CDK6 overexpression,
we examined their response to CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment in cell
proliferation assays. High levels of CDK6 resulted in a 4–11-fold
increase in IC50 (LY5219) and also led to a reduced pRb response
(S780 and S795) to the drug. Moreover, overexpression of CDK6 in
T47D cells (T47D-CDK6-N1) prevented dephosphorylation of Rb by
100 nM LY5219 after 48 h (Figures 4a–d and Supplementary
Figure 4). We further noted that overexpression of CDK6 was
associated with suppression of cyclin D1 levels while drug
treatment was associated with greater increases in cyclin D1
levels in parental cells consistent with CDK4/6- regulating cyclin
D1 expression in these cells. We went on to examine clones
expressing different levels of CDK6 and found that higher CDK6
levels correlated with higher LY5219 IC50s. For instance, T47DCDK6-N2 expressed ﬁve times more protein than parental T47D,
while T47D-CDK6-N1 expressed 20 times more protein. Correspondingly, the IC50 of LY5219 for T47D-CDK6-N2 cells was
143.6 nM, while the IC50 for T47D-CDK6-N1 cells was 960.4 nM
(Figures 4e and f). The data from these ER+ cell lines is consistent
with CDK6 overexpression directly promoting resistance to
CDK4/6 inhibitors.
Acquired CDK6 ampliﬁcation and reduced ER/PR expression
One of the major drivers of cyclin D1–CDK4/6 activity in breast
cancer cells is hormone-mediated activation of the ER.15 This
induction of the CDK4/6 kinases has been shown to be essential
for estrogen-driven cell proliferation.16,17 Previous reports have
suggested that E2F may be a key regulator of expression of ER.18,19
Given the role of CDK4/6 in regulating free E2F levels, we sought
to determine whether there might be changes in ER or PR
expression in the resistant cells where the G1–S checkpoint was
abrogated. In the MR cells, mRNA and protein levels of ER and PR
were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the parental cells.

experiments. (c) MCF-7, MR-sh NC and MR-sh CDK6 cells were treated with LY2835219 (100 nM) and collected at indicated times. Lysates were
immunoblotted with the designated antibodies.

Moreover, the expression of ER-regulated genes, such as XBP1 and
MYC, was also markedly suppressed (Figures 5a and c). Similar ER
and PR loss was further detected in the TR cells compared with
parental T47D cell lines (Figures 5b and d).
To exclude the possibility that this was an MR-speciﬁc off-target
effect because of exposure to drug, we examined the kinetics of
loss of ER and noted that neither transient drug inhibition nor
transient CDK6 overexpression led to declines in ER or PR
expression in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 5A).
Next, we assessed the ER and PR levels in our models engineered
to overexpress CDK6 including MCF-7 (Figures 5e and f), T47D
(Supplementary Figure 5B) and CAMA-1 (Supplementary
Figure 5C). In all cases, we observed diminished ESR1 and PGR
expression. By contrast, overexpression of CDK4 did not result in
signiﬁcant changes in PGR or ESR1 expression levels
(Supplementary Figure 5D). It thus appeared that prolonged
exposure to high levels of CDK6, associated with drug resistance,
was necessary for ER downregulation.
To understand if these effects were unique to the CDK6mediated models of resistance, we assessed ER and PR levels in
another independent LY5219 resistance model, which was derived
Oncogene (2017) 2255 – 2264

from CAMA-1 cells (CR) and was found to have overexpression of
CCNE1 (Figure 5g). This model also showed reduced mRNA levels
of ESR1 and PGR, suggesting that reduction of these receptors may
be related to a variety of mechanisms that converge on inhibiting
the G1/S checkpoint. Finally, to further understand the basis of
loss of ER expression, we examined occupancy of RNA polymerase II
at the ESR1 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
against Pol II (Figure 5h). We observed MR cells to have markedly
reduced RNA Pol II occupancy at the ESR1 promoter compared
with parental MCF-7 cells, suggesting that transcriptional repression of ER may underlie its diminished expression.
Acquired CDK6 ampliﬁcation promotes hormone resistance
We next investigated whether the changes in ER/PR expression
might be associated with a change in the dependence of
these cells on the ER for growth. We examined the effect of
the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant (ICI182, 780) on MCF-7 parental
and MR cells and found that the resistant cells required
signiﬁcantly higher levels of ICI182 (IC50 = 48 nM) compared with
parental cells (IC50 = 0.23 nM) to block the growth (Figure 6a).
Moreover, selective ER modulators, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen

(4-OHT), also showed a higher IC50 (2030 nM) in MR cells compared with MCF-7 parental cells (113.2 nM) (Figure 6b). To
further understand the basis for this insensitivity, we examined
the effect of fulvestrant on ER/PR expression and activity in the
MR and MCF-7 cells (Figure 6c). Increasing doses of ICI182 was
able to downregulate ER and PR expression in both parental
and MR cells; however, this downregulation was not associated

with the same magnitude of pRb loss in the MR cells as in the
parental cells.
To determine whether this loss of ER/PR expression and
dependence might occur in patients, we examined a series of
patients with ER+ breast cancer who received treatment with a
CDK4/6 inhibitor and had tumor biopsies performed both before
and after exposure to drug. We examined ER and PR levels using a

clinical assessment of ER/PR expression (Table 1 and

patients examined, it appeared that several patients had tumors
that changed from ER+ to ER − or from PR+ to PR − . We
unfortunately could not assess whether there was a loss of ER
dependence in these patients as none of them underwent singleagent hormone therapy. Nevertheless, the data raise the
possibility that a subset of patients who develop resistance to
CDK4/6 inhibitors might manifest with associated tumoral
changes in ER/PR levels and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, as
well as endocrine therapies such as fulvestrant.
DISCUSSION
A number of clinically effective breast cancer therapies have been
developed that work, in part, by indirectly reducing the activity of
the CDK4/6–cyclin D complex.20 Foremost among these are
hormonal therapies where ER regulation of cyclin D1 has been

demonstrated to be critical to their effectiveness.21 Clinical
resistance to these forms of therapy appears to involve reactivation of CDK4/6–cyclin D either through reactivation of ER (e.g.
ESR1 mutation) or through other growth factor signaling pathways
(e.g. ERBB2 ampliﬁcation).22–24 Therefore, direct pharmacologic
inhibition of the G1–S checkpoint kinases, CDK4 and CDK6, has
long been considered a promising strategy.4,6,15 Selective
inhibitors of CDK4/6 indeed have proven highly effective in large
clinical trials of patients with advanced ER+ breast cancer;
however, resistance to therapy has also frequently
emerged.9,10,25–27 The basis for resistance in the clinical setting
is not well understood, nor is there consensus on how to
effectively manage patients after cancer progression on CDK4/6
inhibitor therapy. In this study, we sought to uncover mechanisms
that might engender resistance to ER+ breast cancer cells
previously sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors and identiﬁed alterations
that not only led to CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor resistance but also
resistance to hormonal therapies.
To identify alterations that promote resistance to CDK4/6
inhibitors, we exposed two different hormone-sensitive cell line
models to the potent CDK4/6 kinase inhibitor, LY5219.8,27 Longterm exposure of the models to drug led to multiple independent
clones that had evidence for ampliﬁcation of the CDK6 kinase. This
was observed in two different cell lines and in experimental
replicates conducted months apart. Although other changes
might have also occurred in these cells over time, the sufﬁciency
of CDK6 to promote resistance was clear from experiments in
which CDK6 was knocked down in the resistant cells and in which
CDK6 was overexpressed in the parental cells. In both cases, CDK6
overexpression was clearly correlated with a requirement for
higher doses of inhibitor to cause cell growth inhibition.
How CDK6 overexpression promotes resistance to CDK4/6
inhibition is not yet clear. CDK6 is known to have kinaseindependent functions;28,29 however, the close correlation
between the dose of kinase inhibitor causing loss of pRb and
the dose blocking cell proliferation supports the premise that the
kinase function of CDK6 is essential for resistance. Interestingly,
overexpression of CDK4 was never observed in the models and
enforced overexpression of CDK4 did not promote inhibitor
resistance. In actuality, we often observed decreases in CDK4
expression in the resistant cells. One speculation is that the
partner cyclin or other components of the complex inﬂuence

2262
inhibitor response. For instance, CDK6 may preferentially bind to
cyclin D3 and this complex proves more drug resistant than the
cyclin D1–CDK4 complex. Nevertheless, the data raise the
possibility that compounds with even greater potency against
CDK6 might be of clinical interest, particularly in the setting of
acquired resistance.
In addition to ampliﬁcation of CDK6, we also identiﬁed two
models: one with mutation in Rb as well as CDK6 overexpression,
and another with cyclin E1 overexpression. Both of them were well
correlated with inactivity of CDK4/6 inhibitors. This observation
was in line with prior reports on the essential role of pRb and
CCNE1 in mediating the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors.12,30,31 Taken
together with our models demonstrating CDK6 ampliﬁcation, the
ﬁndings suggest that alterations that uncouple the G1–S
checkpoint from hormone or growth factor regulation may prove
to be a major route to drug resistance. One prediction that might
then follow is that tumors that develop resistance to CDK4/6
inhibitors will also prove resistant to inhibition of the major
pathway driving CDK4/6 in those cells—in this case, the ER
pathway. This appeared to be the case in our cells, although
unexpectedly we also observed a loss of ER/PR signaling.
Cells that were chronically exposed to LY5219 exhibited a
marked loss in ER and PR mRNA and protein expression. This was
observed to occur in models with different mechanisms of
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition potentially implying the basis is
related to constitutive bypass of the G1–S checkpoint. We
speculate that one potential effector of this response may be
the E2F family of transcription factors that would be more
persistently liberated from Rb and function as known regulators of
ER expression.18,19 Irrespectively, this loss of ER/PR expression was
conﬁrmed to occur in patients receiving these drugs who had
biopsies after progression on treatment. Although our numbers of
postprogression samples are quite limited, it is uncommon to
observe true loss of ER+/PR+ status clinically and thus these
individual events portend a real possibility that a subset of the
patients who develop resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors will further
manifest with decreases in ER/PR expression. With respect to ER
dependence, loss of ER expression in the models was strongly
associated with an acquired insensitivity to hormonal agents such
as the ER antagonists—fulvestrant and tamoxifen. These ﬁndings
are consistent with a recently published study32 showing that
CDK6 overexpression is associated with resistance to fulvestrant.
Our results point to an uncoupling of cell cycle progression from
ER signaling occurring, in part, through a loss of ESR1 transcription. This loss of dependence may certainly occur even without
changes in expression; however, our models appeared to manifest
with both loss of expression and dependence.
The implications for a loss of hormone receptor signaling and
dependence are likely to be quite signiﬁcant. Patients with ER+
breast cancer are routinely given sequential endocrine-based
therapy on the premise that the target pathway remains the
driver. Patients may be treated with multiple lines of therapy
including aromatase inhibitor, selective ER degrader and combination aromatase inhibitor with mTORC1 inhibition (everolimus).
The value of such therapies in the context of ER − and ERindependent disease is likely to be low. This ﬁnding, if validated in
large clinical cohorts, would place a premium on post-therapy
biopsies to conﬁrm the ongoing role and presence of the driver
pathway. More importantly, alternative targeting approaches
could be considered for tumors understood to be at risk for
developing such mechanisms of resistance, potentially forestalling
the development of an ER − phenotype.

Reagents
LY2835219 was provided by Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, IN, USA).
PD0332991, LEE011, fulvestrant (ICI182 780) and tamoxifen (4Oncogene (2017) 2255 – 2264

hydroxytamoxifen) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX,
USA). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen was dissolved in ethanol, whereas all other
drugs were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide.
Phospho-Rb (Ser780) (D59B7, no. 8180), phospho-Rb (Ser795) (no. 9301),

Cell culture and resistant cell line establishment
All breast cancer cell lines used were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. T47D cells were cultured in RPMI, MCF-7
in DMEM (Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium) high glucose and CAMA-1
in DMEM-F12 with non-essential amino acids. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Corning, NY, USA),
100 μg/ml streptomycin and 4 mM glutamine. The 293T cell line was
obtained from the laboratory of Ping Chi and cultured in DMEM with high
glucose.
Drug-resistant cells were established by continuous selection using
methods similar to those previously described.33 Brieﬂy, MCF-7, T47D and
CAMA-1 cells were cultured in medium containing LY5219 at the
concentration of 500 nM (T47D) or 100 nM (MCF-7 and CAMA-1) with fresh
media and drug replenished every 3 days. Cells were subcultured every 2–
3 weeks with a 25% increase in drug concentration. The resistant cells were
established after 4 months (ﬁnal concentration: T47D 1 μM, MCF-7 200 nM,
CAMA-1 100 nM) and maintained in the presence of 100 nM LY5219 and
named as MR, TR and CAMA-1 resistant (CR).

Plasmids and generation of stable cell lines
pDONR223-CDK6, pDONR223-CDK4 (a gift from William Hahn and David
Root; Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA); plasmid nos. 23688 and 23778)34
and pDONR223-GFP (a gift from the Yu Chen Lab) was delivered in the
MSCV-N-Flag-HA-IRES-PURO plasmid using the Gateway LR Clonase II
Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and named as MSCV-N-CDK6,
MSCV-N-CDK4 and MSCV-N-control. Retroviral vector pSIREN-RetroQ-CDK6shRNA was a gift from Dr Judy Lieberman (Addgene; plasmid no. 25789).35
pSIREN-RetroQ-shN was used as a negative control (a gift from Joe Landry;
Addgene; plasmid no. 73665). Retroviral infections were performed as
described previously.36

Human tumor specimens
Patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer were prospectively enrolled on
an institutional review board-approved protocol for treatment regimens
either including abemaciclib or ribociclib. Among these patients, those
who had routine standard of care biopsies of their breast cancer both
before and after protocol therapy and agreed (signed informed consent) to
have their specimens analyzed for further research were included. Routine
analyses of ER/PR immunohistochemistry were performed using Food
Drug Administration-approved antibodies and scored by the clinical
pathologist.

Cell proliferation
Cells (2.5 × 104/ml) were seeded into 96-well plates in DMEM and treated
with different concentrations of indicated drugs. On days 0, 3, 5 and 7,
25 μl of resazurin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was added into
each well according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 4 h,
ﬂuorescence in the plate was measured using a microplate reader
(SpectraMax M5; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with an excitation
and emission of 560 and 590 nm. Results were normalized to blank media
with no cells. Cell growth data from day 5 was then plotted as the
percentage inhibition against the log concentration of indicated drug. IC50
was determined using a sigmoidal regression model using GraphPad Prism
6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and was deﬁned as the
concentration of drug required for a 50% reduction in growth. Each
experiment was repeated at least three times with six replicates.

Immunoblotting

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

After treatment, cells were washed two times in cold phosphate-buffered
saline and collected on ice. Cells were lysed and immunobloted as
described previously.36 Equal amounts of total protein (30 μg) was
separated by 4–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. Membranes were sequentially probed with indicated primary
antibodies and corresponding mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Blots were then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA).

Quantitative RT–PCR
Taqman primers for CDK4, CDK6, CCND1, CCNE1, CCNE2, CCNA2, E2F1, RB1,
ESR1, PGR, GREB1, XBP1, TFF1 and MYC were used to detect mRNA levels by
quantitative RT–PCR. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA with the qScript
cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, Beverly, MA, USA) and 2 μl of cDNA
was added to the Taqman PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) along with the appropriate primer. Relative quantiﬁcation for
each mRNA was performed using the comparative CT method with a ViiA 7
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The mRNA expression of each
gene was normalized to that of RPLP0. TaqMan primers were all purchased
from Applied Biosystems. Each experiment was repeated at least three
times with three replicates.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Cells (2 × 104 cells) were treated with drug or dimethyl sulfoxide for 48 h.
Both adherent and ﬂoating cells were collected. Nuclei were isolated and
stained with ethidium bromide. The DNA content (G0/G1, S and G2/M) was
determined by ﬂow cytometry as described previously.37

ChIP analysis
ChIP assay was performed as described before.38 Brieﬂy, cells were
crosslinked and collected. Chromatin was broken down into 200–1000 bp
fragments through 30 min sonication. One microgram of antibody was
added into the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Twenty microliters
of ChIP grade Protein A/G magnetic beads were added into each IP tube
and incubated for 2–4 h. IP samples were washed and crosslinks reversed
by adding proteinase K and incubating overnight at 65 °C. DNA was then
recovered using the Qiagen PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen). RNA polymerase
II antibody (05-623; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used in this
study. Primer sequences used for RNA polymerase II ChIP were as follows:
ESR1 pol, forward: 5′-TTGTGCCTGGAGTGATGTTT -3′ and reverse: 5′-GCAT
TACAAAGGTGCTGGAG-3′.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Cell lines were cultured with colcemid (0.1 μg/ml) and ﬁxed in methanol
acetic acid (3:1). FISH analysis was performed on the ﬁxed cells according
to standard protocols with a two-color CDK6/Cen7 probe. The probe mix
consisted of bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome clones containing the fulllength CDK6 gene (clones RP11-809H24 and RP11-1102K14; labeled with
Red dUTP) and a centromeric repeat plasmid for chromosome 7 served as
the control (clone p7t1; labeled with Green dUTP). Slides were scanned
and representative regions were selected for imaging. For each cell line at
least 100 discrete interphase nuclei and 10 metaphases were analyzed.
Ampliﬁcation was deﬁned as CDK6:Cen7 (control) ratio of ⩾ 1.2, 46 copies
of CDK6 (independent of control locus) or at least one small cluster of
CDK6 (⩾4 signals resulting from tandem repeat/duplication).

Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed using two-sided standard Student's
t-tests and probability values of Po 0.05 were regarded as statistically
signiﬁcant. Analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism v.6.0c (GraphPad Software).
