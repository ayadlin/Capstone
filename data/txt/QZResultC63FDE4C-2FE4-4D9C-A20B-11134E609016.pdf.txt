Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually
transmitted infection and the cause of cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among
women worldwide. HPV vaccine uptake is particularly important for females surviving cancer, some of
whom are at high risk for HPV complications because of the direct and indirect effects of cancer treatment.
Thus, version 3.0 of the Children’s Oncology Group’s Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of
Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer recommends HPV vaccination for all eligible females surviving childhood cancer. Because this vaccine was only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
in 2006, little is known regarding the complexity of vaccination uptake among those surviving cancer. The
purpose of this article was to describe the HPV vaccine and its usefulness in the survivorship population,
provide a rationale for describing cancer survivors as being at increased risk for HPV complications, identify factors associated with HPV vaccination, and discuss the utilization of these predictors in designing
strategies to promote adherence to HPV vaccination recommendations within the survivorship context.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection,1,2 and epidemiologic studies indicate that approximately 80% of sexually active women contract HPV during their
lifetime.3-5 Among young women, the prevalence of HPV has been estimated to be as high as 40% among
sexually active females ages 14 to 19 years and 49% among those ages 20 to 24 years.6 The United States
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance of 2007, a national school-based survey of health-risk behaviors among
high school students, reports 48% of all students and 46% of female students have engaged in sexual intercourse.7 Women who begin having sex at younger ages and those with more sexual partners are at highest
risk for HPV exposure. HPV infection rates are highest in younger women and rise sharply soon after the
median age of first sexual activity, which is reported to be 16.9 years for females.8
Of the >100 identified types of HPV, approximately 40 affect the genital tract.9 Oncogenic HPV strains
have been etiologically linked to cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, and oral cancers. Cervical cancer (which is
caused by HPV) is the second most common cancer among women worldwide and is the leading cause of

cancer-related deaths among women in developing countries.10 In 2004, 11,892 women in the United States were
diagnosed with cervical cancer, which resulted in 3850
disease-specific deaths. Because cervical cancer is commonly asymptomatic until it is has progressed beyond the
point at which effective treatment is possible, primary prevention is the best approach for reducing the expression of
this and other HPV-related malignancies. Regular screening using the Papanicolaou (Pap) test has been the most
successful tactic for identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, which is a precursor to cervical cancer.
Approximately 55 million Pap tests are performed
each year in the United States, and of these, 3.5 million
(6%) yield abnormal results that require medical followup.11 HPV infections are primarily asymptomatic, and
infected women typically have normal Pap test results, as
infections usually clear without abnormality.11 However,
all HPV strains have the potential to produce precancerous cells in the cervix that can be identified by Pap
screening.
Genital HPV is transmitted by skin or mucosal contact, almost exclusively through sexual contact. Most
commonly, the virus is transmitted through vaginal or
anal intercourse. Oral and digital infection with genital
HPV strains also occurs; however, the risk of transmission
by digital-genital or oral-genital contact appears minimal.12 Although most HPV infections clear spontaneously, persistent infection with a high-risk human
papillomavirus type is necessary to cause cervical cancer.13
In particular, HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for the
majority of worldwide invasive cervical cancers.14 Progression from HPV infection to precancerous abnormal cell
growth to cervical cancer is a slow process that may take
decades to complete. Thus, although HPV occurs most
often in sexually active adolescents and women ages 15 to
24 years, cervical cancer most often occurs in women aged
>40 years, with the median age at diagnosis for all cervical
cancer patients being 47 to 48 years.15,16
Recent efforts to reduce cervical cancer have led to
the development of vaccines to protect against HPV,
which are currently available and have been demonstrated
to be safe and clinically effective.17-19 In June of 2006, the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)20 approved
Gardasil (Merck & Co., Darmstadt, Germany), a quadrivalent vaccine protecting recipients from HPV types 6,
11, 16, and 18, which account for 70% of cervical cancers
5628

and 90% of genital warts cases.21 Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK), a bivalent vaccine that is currently available in Australia, the Philippines, and the
European Union, protects against HPV types 16 and 18
and has recently been approved for use in the US by the
FDA. In clinical trials, these vaccines (when administered
as directed) demonstrated 98% efficacy in protecting
females against the specified HPV types, thus eliminating
the risk of grade 2 of 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,
adenocarcinoma in situ, and other HPV-type specific
complications.19,20,22-24 Furthermore, these vaccines
appear to be relatively safe. Specific to Gardasil, injectionsite adverse experiences were reported to be generally mild
to moderate in intensity for pain, swelling, and erythema.
Systemic adverse events were reported to be mild to moderate with 1.5% of vaccine and 1.1% of placebo recipients
experiencing fever 38.9 C, with no differences emerging across vaccine and placebo groups.4 Vaccine-related
serious adverse events occurred in <0.1% of all study participants, and included events such as bronchospasm, gastroenteritis, headache/hypertension, vaginal hemorrhage,
and injection site pain/movement impairment. There
were no deaths reported in these trials secondary to the
HPV vaccine or delivery procedures.24 Contraindications
for vaccination include pregnancy and hypersensitivity to
active substances/excipients in the vaccine.
On the basis of these favorable findings, routine
HPV vaccination is currently recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for adolescent
girls ages 11 to 12 years, but the injection series can be
started for those as young as 9 years of age, because Gardasil has been approved by the FDA for females between
ages 9 and 26 years.19 It is recommended that girls receive
the series of injections before the onset of sexual activity
because of the mechanism of HPV transmission.20 HPV
vaccination is not licensed in the United States for males
of any age, although the European Union, Mexico,
Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Costa Rica, and Korea
have approved Gardasil for use in males,25,26 and a recent
Merck-funded phase 3 trial found that Gardasil was effective in preventing 90% of HPV-related external genital
lesions among adolescent and young adult males.27 These
findings suggest that in the United States, HPV vaccine
recommendations may eventually include males, because
they are HPV carriers, are vulnerable to HPV-related cancers, and may respond favorably to the HPV vaccine.24

HPV Vaccine and Cancer Survivors/Klosky et al

The public health benefits of HPV immunization
are considerable. The American Cancer Society estimates
a possible reduction of cervical cancer risk by >70% during the next decade with the implementation of the HPV
vaccine.24 Such a decline in cervical cancer rates will
depend on the number of carcinogenic HPV types eventually targeted by the vaccines, durability of protection by
vaccination, degree of vaccination coverage among at-risk
populations, and whether the medical community and
the public continue to follow recommended screening
guidelines.24 Therefore, promotion of HPV vaccine
uptake is critical, particularly among those populations at
increased risk for HPV-related complications.

Women Surviving Childhood Cancer Are
at Increased Risk for HPV-Related
Complications
Although it is well known that survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for second malignancies, an
increased incidence of cervical carcinoma and other HPVrelated cancers has not been uniformly observed across
diagnostic groups in this population. This finding begs the
question as to whether women surviving childhood cancer
are at increased risk for HPV-related complications such as
cervical cancer. Because the median age for the expression
of cervical cancer is 47 to 48 years,16 and only 2.8% of the
female survivors in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study
cohort (which systematically monitors for second malignancies) are older than 51 years, the relative risk of cervical
and other HPV-related complications among women surviving childhood cancer risk is not definitively known. As
treatment for childhood cancer continues to improve, and
the life expectancy of childhood cancer survivors continues
to rise, it is likely that the expression of cervical carcinoma
and other HPV-related cancers will increase in this population. Nevertheless, for those females receiving specific types
of cancer therapy in childhood, evidence for HPV-related
vulnerability is already mounting, indicating the increased
need for HPV vaccination in these high-risk groups.
Immunosuppression
It has been well established that women who have undergone renal, liver, or lung transplantation are at increased
risk for HPV-related genital and oral disease, including
Cancer

December 15, 2009

cancer,28-33 and persistent HPV infection resulting from
impaired immune clearance has been implicated as the
mechanism responsible for these sequelae. Women with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also at
increased risk for HPV-associated malignancies, are more
frequently diagnosed with advanced and difficult to treat
cervical cancers, and are more likely to experience recurrence after treatment.34-39 As impaired immune function
appears to be responsible for the increased rates of cervical
and oral dysplasia experienced by these groups, we will
target our review on female childhood cancer patients
with persistent immune compromise (particularly those
treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or
pelvic irradiation and those diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma). The implications of HPV vaccination in these
groups will also be discussed.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experience extreme
immunosuppression as a result of pretransplant conditioning. This conditioning (which includes high-dose chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation) is
necessary to achieve tumor control and, in allogeneic
graft recipients, sustained hematopoietic engraftment.
Although most patients will have complete immune
reconstitution by 2 years after transplant, the severity or
duration of immunodeficiency depends on several factors,
including the type of stem cells and their pretransplant
manipulation, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and the
age of the transplant recipient. Chronic GVHD, for
example, slows immune system reconstitution due to
GVHD-associated T-cell dysfunction in addition to the
immunosuppressive drugs required for GVHD control.
Typically, patients who receive T-cell–replete autologous
or allogeneic grafts will develop normal CD3þ cells 3
months after transplant.40 Yet during this period, CD4
positivity (þ) is decreased, whereas higher proportions of
CD8þ cells exist. This inverted CD4þ/CD8þ ratio may
continue for >1 year. The longer that immune recovery is
delayed, the likelihood of infectious complications from
bacteria, fungi, and viruses (such as HPV) increases.40
Women who undergo bone marrow transplant
as part of cancer treatment are at significantly increased
risk for cervical dysplasia and second cancers, including
cervical cancers. When Socie et al41 examined second
5629

Review Article

malignancies among 3182 children who received allogeneic bone marrow transplant as part of treatment for acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the estimated cumulative risk for
a new solid cancer was 11% by 15 years after transplant,
which represented a 34-fold increased risk compared with
expected population-based rates. Those who received
transplants at earlier ages and those who received higher
doses of total body irradiation as part of transplant conditioning were more likely to develop solid tumors after
transplant. Female survivors of bone marrow transplantation are also at significantly increased risk for cervical dysplasia, a precancerous marker of cervical cancer. Whereas
the proportion of abnormal Pap smears is typically 3% to
6% among healthy women, those 3 years after bone marrow transplantation had a disproportionate rate of abnormal Pap smears that ranged from 14% to 54% and from
4% to 33% for allogeneic and autologous transplant
recipients, respectively.42 At 7 years after allogeneic transplant, 43% of females had abnormal Pap cytology smear
findings, with 20% experiencing HPV-related high-grade
(and 14% experiencing low-grade) squamous intraepithelial lesions. Those women experiencing chronic GVHD
post-transplant that required prolonged systematic immunosuppressive therapy for >3 years were at the highest
risk for dysplasia and more aggressive abnormalities of the
cervix. Specific to cervical cancer, Bhatia et al43 conducted
a retrospective study examining the occurrence of new
solid cancers among 2129 patients who received bone
marrow transplantation between 1976 and 1998. Similar
to the findings reported by Socie et al,41 the cumulative
probability for developing a solid cancer was nearly 15%
at 15 years after bone marrow transplant. Transplant
recipients had a 13-fold increased risk for the development of cervical cancer compared with expected population-based rates. Pretreatment conditioning factors were
not found to be associated with the expression of new cervical cancers, and the authors concluded that immunodeficiency in combination with HPV exposure best
explained the elevated rates of cervical dysplasia and cancer in this population.
Hodgkin lymphoma

Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by malignant
transformation of lymphocytes. Generalized immune deficiency/suppression is a classic disease feature of Hodgkin
lymphoma and is associated with persistent deficits in cellu5630

lar immunity relating to enhanced sensitivity to suppressor
monocytes and T-suppressor cells and abnormal interleukin-2 production.44,45 This immune deficiency is worsened
by cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
or splenectomy), and often persists long after treatment.
Clinically, the immune deficiency associated with Hodgkin
lymphoma results in increased susceptibility and persistence
of bacterial, fungal, and viral infections such as HPV.
Therefore, vaccinations and prompt treatment of infections
are particularly important in this population.
It is not yet clear whether patients develop Hodgkin
lymphoma because of these deficits in cellular immunity
or as a result of the disease, and specific to HPV-related
complications, there appears to be evidence for both etiologies. A premorbid history of genital warts or herpes zoster has, for example, been associated with the later
development of Hodgkin lymphoma,46 whereas HPVrelated epidermodysplasia verruciformis and cervical cancers have also been reported in patients after treatment for
Hodgkin lymphoma.47,48 In what to our knowledge is the
largest study of HPV infection among women with
Hodgkin lymphoma performed to date, the medical
charts of 666 patients consecutively treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between
1963 and 1982 were retrospectively reviewed. Records
that included the results of Pap testing, cervical biopsy,
colposcopy, or related examinations were included in the
study.49 Among the 85 participants who met the study
entry criteria, 46% had HPV infection and related neoplasia of the cervix or anogenital region. Specifically, 38%
had unicentric or multicentric condylomatous lesions either with (n ¼ 14) or without (n ¼ 19) intraepithelial
neoplastic lesions, and 7% (n ¼ 6) had experienced invasive carcinoma of the cervix and/or vulva. Furthermore,
being HPV positive was associated with a 2.88 excess risk
for having high-grade Hodgkin lymphoma (stage III or
IV) and with being more likely to receive combined radiation and chemotherapy treatment. These findings suggest
that women with Hodgkin lymphoma have increased vulnerability to HPV-related complications, and that this
susceptibility is because of the compromised immune
functioning associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.
Pelvic irradiation

Initiation of the immune response to genital HPV
infection is largely orchestrated by epithelial cells within
Cancer

HPV Vaccine and Cancer Survivors/Klosky et al

the lower genital tract. Genital tract epithelial cells play a
key role in immunity to HPV by means of pathogen recognition, expression of antimicrobial mediators, and production of cytokines and chemokines that direct the immune
response.50 Female cancer patients treated with therapies
toxic to mucosal surfaces, such as anthracyclines and radiotherapy, may be more prone to HPV infection simply on
the basis of impaired genital tract epithelial cell function.
Similarly, survivors with chronic GVHD that involves the
genital tract mucosa may have impaired epithelial cell function. When considering the potential for an underlying
genetic predisposition to malignancy in patients treated for
childhood cancer, who may then acquire impaired epithelial cell function after radiotherapy, one can argue that it is
important for females undergoing pelvic irradiation as part
of childhood cancer treatment to undergo HPV vaccination to prevent HPV-related complications.
Similar to those treated for Hodgkin lymphoma or
with HSCT, women who have received pelvic irradiation
are significantly more likely to experience HPV-related
cervical and vaginal dysplasia and carcinomas of the genital tract. When examining lesions of postirradiation dysplasia among 17 women previously treated with pelvic
irradiation because of malignancies of the uterine cervix,
vagina, and endometrium, 1 or more types of HPV DNA
was identified in 8 (47%) of the lesions, and condyloma
acuminatum was found in 5 of 11 (46%) cases.51 Similarly, 43 of 88 (49%) of women developed colposcopyverified vaginal dysplastic lesions after pelvic irradiation,
with high-risk HPV being identified in 42 (98%) of the
lesions.52 Approximately one– third of women who experienced gynecologic cancers after irradiation for cervical,
endometrial, vulvar, or colon cancer had HPV-related
tumors 10 to 37 years after radiotherapy exposure.
Among women treated with pelvic irradiation, the
etiology of post-treatment cervical dysplasia and cancers
has been attributed to recurrence of original malignancy,
mutation of cervicovaginal mucosa cells because of radiation exposure, natural HPV dysplastic processes, or a
combination of these mechanisms driven by treatmentinduced immunosuppression.51 Although it is difficult to
isolate 1 process primarily responsible for these dysplastic
and neoplastic outcomes, the higher–than–expected HPV
infection rates, multiple types of HPV DNA identified in
cervical lesions developing after radiotherapy, and similarities between naturally occurring cervical dysplasia and
Cancer

December 15, 2009

cancers reinforce the notion that HPV (in combination
with immunosuppression) is primarily responsible for
these post-treatment events.51-53 Although the HPV vaccine to our knowledge has yet to be tested among women
who received pelvic irradiation as part of their cancer
treatment, murine models examining the effect of pelvic
radiotherapy and cisplatin on HPV vaccine responsiveness
found that previous cancer treatment does not prevent the
induction of an effective immune response by a peptide
vaccine. This finding suggests that HPV vaccine efficacy
should not be compromised among girls who receive pelvic radiation before vaccine administration. Although the
impact of chemotherapy-related immunosuppression on
antibody response to the HPV vaccine has not been evaluated, these preclinical data also suggest that HPV vaccination may be effective even in women who have had
previous chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to
confirm the efficacy of the HPV vaccine in this group.
Behavioral, Cognitive-Behavioral, and
Demographic Risk Factors
Behavioral risk factors

Despite their increased risk for cervical dysplasia and
cancers, female survivors of childhood cancer are not
engaging in cervical cancer screening at rates recommended by the American Cancer Society. After adjusting
for age, ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance, women surviving childhood cancer were found to be
significantly less likely than their healthy siblings to have
undergone a Pap smear within the previous 3 years,54
with Hispanic survivors being the least likely to have
undergone this screening.55 Survivors of childhood cancer
without insurance and those aged >30 years are already
less likely to report secured medical care, and this risk
increases as the survivor ages and time since diagnosis
increases.56 It has also been suggested that survivors who
perceive themselves to be infertile as a result of cancer
therapy may engage in riskier sexual behaviors, which in
turn increases HPV exposure risk.57
Cognitive-behavioral risk factors

Up to 40% of survivors of childhood cancer have
neurocognitive deficits, with inattention and hyperactivity
being among the most commonly reported late effects of
treatment.58,59 Within the general population, evidence
exists linking inattention and/or hyperactivity to increased
5631

Review Article

risky sexual behavior. For example, Flory et al60 found
that young adults who were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as children were more likely to
engage in behaviors such as earlier initiation of sexual activity and intercourse, increased number of sexual partners, increased casual sexual encounters, and increased
partner pregnancies (among men) as compared with unaffected community peers. Similarly, those experiencing
hyperactivity in childhood are more likely to become
parents and to have been treated for a sexually transmitted
disease.61 Because survivors of childhood cancer are more
likely to experience inattention and/or hyperactivity, they
are consequently at risk for increased engagement in risky
sexual behaviors and contracting sexually transmitted
infections such as HPV.
Demographic risk factors

In US population-based studies, the occurrence of
cervical cancer has been associated with lower education,
lower household income, and Hispanic ethnicity.62 Socioeconomic differences in male and female sexual behavior,
along with access to cervical cancer screening, have been
suggested to potentially explain these findings.63 Among
childhood cancer survivors, women who are college educated, medically insured, and older are more likely to have
undergone Pap testing within the previous 3 years as compared with survivors who are less educated, without insurance, and younger.54 Because survivors of childhood
cancer are more likely to report unemployment, lower
educational attainment, and lower annual incomes compared with their siblings,64 they are at increased risk for
cervical cancer and suboptimal cervical cancer screening
as a socioeconomic consequence of their childhood cancer
treatment.
Rates and Predictors of HPV Vaccination
To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies published to date regarding rates of vaccination in the childhood cancer survivor population; thus, findings must be
extrapolated from the healthy population. Although adolescents in the general population report high levels of
acceptance regarding HPV vaccination, the actual rates of
vaccination initiation and completion are reportedly low,
ranging from 5% to 25%.65-67 Although differences in
reported vaccination rates may be attributed to time since
5632

the vaccine’s FDA approval, in addition to variability in
regard to sampling methods, sexual history, and age of
female participants, the reported HPV vaccination rates
are significantly lower than the 90% target established by
the Healthy People 2010 initiative.
Acceptability

Despite relatively low rates of HPV vaccination,
between 66% and 74% of adolescent/young adult females
report intention to receive HPV vaccination in the
future.66,68 Although encouraging, the majority of
females in this age range are already positive for HPV,
underscoring the importance of vaccination before infection. As with adolescents, parents are also accepting of
HPV vaccination for their daughters. Specifically, 55%
to 100% of parents are willing to vaccinate adolescents,
and brief educational interventions have been found
to increase acceptability among parents who were
initially opposed or undecided regarding HPV vaccine
utilization.69-71
Physician recommendation

Adolescents surviving childhood cancer are often
monitored by medical teams specializing in cancer survivorship, and it is well known that medical providers have
considerable influence on their patients’’ immunization
decisions.72,73 Although 90% of pediatricians endorse
HPV immunization, many report parental barriers to
HPV vaccination administration, including concerns
regarding vaccine safety, reluctance to immunize their
child for a sexually transmitted infection and to have discussions regarding sexuality and HPV transmission, belief
that their child already receives too many vaccines, denial
that their child may be at risk for HPV, and concerns that
vaccination would lead to riskier adolescent behaviors.74,75 Of the 10% of physicians who report being
unlikely to recommend HPV vaccination, factors such as
being male, discomfort discussing sexuality issues with
patients, and not routinely prescribing oral contraceptives
are associated with being unlikely to recommend the
vaccine.76 Physician factors associated with intent to
recommend the HPV vaccine included personal and
professional characteristics (eg, age, race, practice location, HPV knowledge), office procedures (eg, vaccinating
children during sports physicals, ill visits, reminder calls),
and vaccine cost and reimbursement.75 Finally,
Cancer

December 15, 2009

HPV Vaccine and Cancer Survivors/Klosky et al

pediatricians’ intent to recommend the HPV vaccine may
be influenced by the endorsement of trusted sources (eg,
American Cancer Society, Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, Advisory
Committee for Immunization Practices).74 The recent
inclusion of HPV vaccination in the new version of the
Children’s Oncology Group’s Long-Term Follow-Up
Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and
Young Adult Cancer may promote successful vaccine
delivery in this patient population.

Familial decision making in the cancer
survivorship context
Despite physician influence, immunization against HPV
is ultimately a familial decision-making process. As the
recommended age for vaccination is relatively young,
child attitudes concerning HPV vaccination are typically
consistent with those of their parents, who often determine whether to vaccinate their daughters.73 Familial predictors of HPV vaccination approval include family
history of cancer, older age of daughter, and familial communication regarding cervical cancer and other HPVrelated topics, in addition to increased perceived vulnerability to and severity of HPV-related complication.68,77,78 On the basis of this cluster of predicative
factors, HPV vaccine implementation in the context of
cancer survivorship visits appears plausible in that all of
these families will have a history of cancer, which is frequently accompanied by an increased sense of health vulnerability among both cancer survivors and their
parents.79 Physician recommendation of HPV vaccine
within the oncology setting may maximize the likelihood
of HPV vaccination, in that this vaccine provides primary
prevention of cervical and other HPV-related cancers.

Future Directions
Although the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices recommends the HPV vaccine for ‘‘those immunosuppressed as a result of disease or medications,’’ the
immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine has not yet been
established among immunocompromised individuals.
Antibody titers for HPV types 6 and 18 have been found
to be significantly lower among vaccinated HIV-infected
children as compared with healthy controls,80 suggesting
Cancer

December 15, 2009

that longitudinal trials are necessary in immunocompromised groups to determine long-term efficacy, appropriate dosing, and timing of vaccine administration. For
immunocompromised survivors of childhood cancer, longitudinal studies will not only allow for the development
of informed recommendations related to both vaccine
administration and safer sexual behavior, but will also
allow for close monitoring of vaccine-related long-term
side effects.
In addition to vaccine safety and efficacy, research is
needed to determine whether specific factors, such as perceived vulnerability to second cancers, familial history of
cancer, and physician recommendation, are particularly
relevant in decision making regarding the HPV vaccine
for childhood cancer survivors and their parents. These
factors could then be used in interventions designed to
increase rates of vaccination in this high-risk group. Examination of barriers to vaccine completion (cost, access
to healthcare, physician and parent education) would also
be beneficial in reducing potential healthcare disparities
specific to the HPV vaccine. The behavioral impact of the
vaccine in terms of sexual behavior and cervical cancer
screening should also be studied.

Conclusions
The HPV vaccine is an important public health tool that
has specific benefits relating to the primary prevention of
cervical and other cancers. The Children’s Oncology
Group’s Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of
Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer (version
3.0), which serves as the gold standard in the screening for
late effects that may arise because of treatment of pediatric
cancer, has recommended HPV vaccination for all eligible
females surviving childhood cancer. Survivors at the highest risk for HPV infection and its related complications
include those undergoing HSCT, those with Hodgkin
lymphoma, those treated with pelvic irradiation, and
those receiving other treatments resulting in sustained
immunosuppression. This risk profile is further potentiated by suboptimal cervical cancer screening, cognitive
late effects, and declines in socioeconomic status commonly observed in childhood cancer survivors. The
endorsement of the HPV vaccine by these guidelines is an
important first step in addressing the need for HPV vaccination in childhood cancer survivors, but interventions
5633

are needed to translate these recommendations into a successful HPV vaccination strategy.
