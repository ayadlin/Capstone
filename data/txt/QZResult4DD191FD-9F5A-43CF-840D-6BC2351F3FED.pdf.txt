BACKGROUND: The treatment and outcomes of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) continue to evolve. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) is used to predict the survival of patients with advanced-stage HL,
but it has not been validated in patients with HIV infection. METHODS: This was a multi-institutional, retrospective study of 229
patients with HIV-associated, advanced-stage, classical HL who received doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
(ABVD) plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Their clinical characteristics were presented descriptively, and multivariate analyses
were performed to identify the factors that were predictive of response and prognostic of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS). RESULTS: The overall and complete response rates to ABVD in patients with HIV-associated HL were 91% and 83%,
respectively. After a median follow-up of 5 years, the 5-year PFS and OS rates were 69% and 78%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, there was a trend toward an IPS score >3 as an adverse factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; P5.15) and OS (HR, 1.84; P5.06).
A cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)-positive (T-helper) cell count <200 cells/lL was associated independently with both PFS (HR,
2.60; P5.002) and OS (HR, 2.04; P5.04). The CD4-positive cell count was associated with an increased incidence of death from other
causes (HR, 2.64; P5.04) but not with death from HL-related causes (HR, 1.55; P5.32). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate
excellent response and survival rates in patients with HIV-associated, advanced-stage, classical HL who receive ABVD and

INTRODUCTION
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection carries an
increased risk of developing a variety of malignancies,
including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS)-defining cancers non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi
sarcoma, and invasive uterine cervical cancer. HIV infection, however, also increases the risk of developing nonAIDS–defining cancers like Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). On
the basis of mounting data, the incidence of HL is increased
by 10-fold in individuals with HIV infection compared
with the general population in Europe and the United
States.1 A recent analysis of combined European cohorts of
HIV-infected individuals has revealed that combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces the incidence of HL.2
The optimal treatment for patients with immunocompetent HL continues to evolve. In randomized, controlled studies that include immunocompetent patients
with classical HL, it has been demonstrated that the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
dacarbazine (ABVD) is effective and is probably less toxic
than more intensive regimens.3,4 A recent study demonstrated an improvement in the outcome of patients with
HIV-associated HL compared with their immunocompetent counterparts when treated with standard regimens.5,6
However, a standard of care in HIV-positive individuals
has not been established, because, in general, HIVpositive patients are excluded from clinical trials, and data
on their outcomes are rather scant.
One of the most commonly used prognostic tools
in immunocompetent patients with advanced HL is the
International Prognostic Score (IPS), which uses 7 clinical and laboratory parameters to construct a scoring system that is capable of predicting survival.7 However, the
IPS has not been fully validated in patients with HIVassociated HL. Hence, the objectives of our study were to
determine the validity of the IPS, to describe the patients’
characteristics and outcomes, and to identify predictive
and prognostic factors in a large cohort of patients with
HIV-associated, advanced-stage, classical HL who were
treated uniformly with ABVD and cART.

Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), 7 from
the United States and Canada, and 3 from South America (Brazil and Peru). The institutional review boards at
each of the participating institutions approved the current study. Patients were identified through a database
search at each of the participating institutions. Patients
aged >18 years with HIV infection and a histopathologic
diagnosis of advanced-stage, classical HL who received
concurrent treatment with ABVD and cART through
December 2010 were included in this study. All patients
must have received ABVD at standard doses with curative intent. cART was defined as 2 nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors plus a third agent that was either
a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor.8,9 Patients were staged by means of
computed tomography, positron emission tomography,
and/or bone marrow biopsy. Patients with a diagnosis of
nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL, stage I or II disease, other concurrent malignancy, or clinical suspicion,
but not laboratory confirmation, of HIV infection were
excluded. Portions of the data sets from previous studies5,10,11 are included in this report.
Data Gathering

Clinical data included age, sex, performance status
according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
scale, years of HIV infection before HL diagnosis, diagnosis of AIDS, presence of B symptoms, presence of bulky
disease (according to the local definition of bulky), clinical
stage, response to therapy, receipt of granulocyte-colony–
stimulating factor (G-CSF), receipt of anti-infectious prophylaxis, relapse and therapy at relapse, receipt of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), final outcome,
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and
cause of death. Laboratory data included cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)-positive (T-helper) cell count, hemoglobin level, white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute
lymphocyte count (ALC), and albumin level. Pathologic
data included the HL histologic subtype.

predictive factors for response to ABVD.13 The outcome
measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence
interval (CI) for not obtaining a complete response (CR) to
ABVD. PFS was defined as the time in months between
the date of pathologic diagnosis and the date of progression,
death, or last follow-up. OS was defined as the time in
months between the date of pathologic diagnosis and the
date of death or last follow-up. PFS and OS estimates were
obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.14 The log-rank
test was used to compare survival estimates.15 Univariate
and multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using
the Cox proportional-hazard regression method.16 The outcome measure was the HR with 95% CI. For the logistic
and survival regression models, univariate analysis (UVA)
was performed for each variable, and only the variables with
P values <.1 were included in the multivariate analysis
(MVA). P values <.05 were considered statistically significant in the MVA. The categorical variable AIDS violated
the proportional-hazard assumption and was not included
in the statistical analysis. A cause-specific survival (CSS)
analysis was performed with HL-related death and death
from other cause as competing factors. HL-related death
was defined as death because of disease progression, as it
was reported by the investigators. Cumulative incidence
function curves were plotted and evaluated using the Fine
and Gray method.17
The distribution of missing data was as follows: use of
prophylaxis, missing for 22% of patients; bulky disease,
missing for 21% of patients; albumin, missing for 20% of
patients; WBC count, missing for 15% of patients; receipt
of G-CSF, missing for 14% of patients; ALC, missing for
14% of patients; hemoglobin, missing for 13% of patients;
CD4-positive cell count, missing for 5% of patients; and
AIDS diagnosis, missing for 2% of patients. Complete data
were available on age, sex, disease stage, the presence of B
symptoms, and HL histologic subtype. Although the missing data appeared to be random, we handled missing data
by performing multiple imputation analysis in addition to
complete case analysis. Multiple imputation analyses for
logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazard regression
tests were performed after generating 5 imputed data sets
using the chained equations method.18,19 All calculations
and graphs were obtained using the STATA 12.1 software
package (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).

received by 12% (n519). After a median follow-up of 61
months, 17% of patients (n538) experienced disease
relapse, and 21% (n549) died. The most common causes
of death were HL progression in 47% of patients (n524),
other malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell and Burkitt
lymphoma in 27% (n514), opportunistic infections in
12% (n56), and other infections in 10% (n55). In the
UVA, age 45 years (P5.04), stage IV disease (P5.01),
and an albumin level <4 g/dL (P5.09) were selected for
MVA. In the MVA, age 45 years (P5.007) and stage IV
disease (P5.01) were independently associated with not
obtaining a CR with ABVD. Complete results are provided in Table 2. The multiple imputation analysis did
not change our results (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Here, we present the results from a large study that
included 229 patients with HIV infection and classical
HL who received uniform treatment with ABVD and
cART. There are several important findings. First, our
study demonstrates that patients with HIV-associated HL
who received ABVD and cART experienced high response
rates. Second, patients with HIV-associated, advancedstage, classical HL who received ABVD and cART experienced high 5-year PFS and OS rates. Third, we observed
that a CD4-positive count <200 cells/lL was an independent, adverse prognostic factor for PFS and OS.
Our cohort of patients with HIV-associated HL
who received ABVD and cART experienced an overall
response rate of 91% and a CR rate of 83%. These results
are comparable to recent studies. In a study by Hentrich
and colleagues, 108 patients with HIV-associated HL
were treated using a risk-adapted approach, which produced a CR rate of 90%.20 It is noteworthy that there was
no difference in CR rates between patients who had early
favorable, early unfavorable, and advanced disease, but no
predictive factor analysis for response was performed. A
study by Montoto and colleagues included 93 HIVpositive patients with HL and reported a CR rate of 74%,
which was not statistically different from the rate in HIVnegative patients (79%).5 However, in that study, no specific factors were independently associated with CR. A
Spanish study in 62 patients who received ABVD produced a CR rate of 87%.11 Finally, a prospective study by
Spina and colleagues in 59 patients with HIV-associated
HL who received the Stanford V regimen (doxorubicin,
vinblastine, mechlorethamine, vincristine, bleomycin,
etoposide, and prednisone) and cART produced a CR
rate of 81%.21 The IPS was significantly associated with
obtaining a CR. It is noteworthy that the CR rate to
ABVD observed in our cohort was comparable to the
response rates to ABVD reported in immunocompetent
HL patients with advanced-stage disease.3,4,22
After a median follow-up of approximately 5 years,
the patients in our cohort had 5-year PFS and OS rates of
69% and 78%, respectively. In the study by Spina et al,21
patients experienced 3-year freedom from progression
and OS rates of 60% and 51%, respectively, and the study
by Montoto et al produced 5-year event-free survival and
OS rates of 59% and 88%, respectively.5 Our results are
similar those reported by Xicoy et al, with estimated 5year PFS and OS rates of 71% and 76%, respectively.11

Figure 3. The cumulative incidence of death is illustrated in
49 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who received doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine plus combination antiretroviral therapy according to the cluster of differentiation 4
(CD4)-positive (CD41) cell count for (Top) lymphomarelated deaths and (Bottom) deaths from other causes.

The results reported by Hentrich et al were also encouraging, with 2-year PFS and OS rates of 92% and 91%,
respectively.20 Most of the studies on HIV-associated HL,
however, are hampered by short follow-up periods, which
might lead to overestimation of survival rates. For example, in the study by Spina and colleagues, the median
follow-up was 17 months, and it was 26 months in the
study by Hentrich et al. We believe our study clearly
enlarges the current body of literature by providing survival data with longer follow-up. The 5-year PFS and OS
rates in our cohort also were comparable to the survival
rates reported in immunocompetent patients with
advanced-stage HL.3,4,22
Few studies have previously analyzed the prognostic
value of the CD4-positive cell count. In the study by Hentrich et al, a CD4-positive count <200 cells/lL was not

associated with PFS or OS after adjusting for covariates.
However, our analysis revealed that a CD4-positive count
<200 cells/lL was an independent, adverse prognostic
factor for PFS and OS after adjusting for several relevant
covariates. It may be reasonable to hypothesize that there
were differences between studies, such as population selection or different therapies. Conversely, we believe our
larger sample size had more power to allow a meaningful
analysis of prognostic factors. In the study by Hentrich
and colleagues, a CD4-positive count <200 cells/lL
study was associated with an HR of 2.8 for PFS and an
HR of 1.2 for OS. In our study, a CD4-positive count
<200 cells/lL was associated with HRs of 2.5 and 2.1 for
PFS and OS, respectively, which we consider to be clinically relevant.
Our CSS analysis demonstrated that the CD4positive cell count was a prognostic factor for death from
other causes but not for HL-related death. This finding
supports the notion that the CD4-positive cell count, as
the best marker of HIV-associated immunodeficiency,
plays an important role in driving deaths from HIVassociated HL but has little or no impact on response to
HL chemotherapy. Both PFS and OS include deaths from
any cause, which may explain why a low CD4-positive
cell count plays such an important role in estimating these
2 endpoints. The current findings demonstrate that the
CD4-positive cell count is a strong and easy-to-use prognostic factor for survival in patients with advanced-stage,
classical HIV-associated HL. However, a low CD4positive count should not be a contraindication to choosing the best established oncologic treatment. Of course,
our findings will need further validation.
The IPS is the most commonly used prognostic tool
in patients with advanced-stage HL and comprises 7 clinical factors to prognosticate PFS.7 The IPS has been evaluated in patients with HIV-associated HL with mixed
results. In the study by Montoto et al, the IPS appeared to
be prognostic for OS but not event-free survival; Spina
et al reported the IPS as prognostic for OS and freedom
from progression; and the study by Hentrich et al indicated that the IPS was not prognostic for PFS or OS. A
Spanish study also demonstrated limited prognostic value
of the IPS for PFS and OS in patients with HIVassociated HL.23 In our cohort, there was a statistical
trend in favor of the IPS as a prognostic factor for PFS
and OS, suggesting a prognostic role for the IPS in HIVassociated, classical HL. We should acknowledge that our
study may have been underpowered to evaluate the prognostic role of the IPS, because our results indicated a sizable albeit nonsignificant HR.

Our study carries several strengths, because it
included 1 of the largest cohorts of patients with HIVassociated, advanced-stage, classical HL to date who
uniformly received standard doses of ABVD and cART,
and it included longer follow-up than previous studies.
However, our study has multiple limitations given its
retrospective design, potential heterogeneity in patient
selection, missing data, and lack of detailed information
on the timing of cART and therapy-associated toxicity.
However, we mitigated the impact of those weaknesses
by performing a large multicenter study that included
consecutive patients. Our findings cannot be translated
to HIV-associated HL patients who do not receive concurrent treatment with ABVD and cART. We dealt
with missing data by performing multiple imputations
for our predictive and prognostic factor analyses. Multiple imputations permit the substitution of missing data
with inferred values that would have taken into account
the heterogeneity and variance of the original data.24 A
recent review and recommendations for the use and
reporting of multiple imputation analyses have been
published.25
In summary, based on the results from our study,
the concurrent administration of ABVD and cART is
associated with high rates of response and survival, arguing in favor of this treatment modality outside of clinical
trials for patients with advanced-stage, HIV-associated,
classical HL. Our study also supports the finding that
HIV-infected patients with HL should receive standard
doses of ABVD, akin to those received by immunocompetent patients, and that HIV-positive patients with HL also
should be included in clinical trials. Finally, the CD4positive cell count at HL diagnosis has emerged as a prognostic marker for PFS and OS in patients with HIVassociated, classical HL.
