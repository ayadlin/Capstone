BACKGROUND. This randomized pilot trial investigated whether primary chemotherapy was feasible in terms of efficacy, survival, toxicity profile, and quality of
life compared with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) given first in chemotherapy-naive patients nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with synchronous brain
metastasis when neurologic symptoms or signs are absent or controlled by supportive care.

METHODS. After stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (0–1 vs 2), the number of intracranial metastases (<3 vs
3), and the presence of extrathoracic extracranial metastasis, eligible patients
were randomized to the primary chemotherapy arm or the WBRT-first arm. World
Health Organization (WHO) response criteria, National Cancer Institute Common

Research Institute and Hospital, National Cancer
Center, Goyang, Gyeonggi, Korea.

Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC; version 2.0), and the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) C-30/LC-13 questionnaire were
used.

RESULTS. A total of 48 patients were enrolled between August 2002 and November 2005. The response rate of chemotherapy and survival outcomes in the primary chemotherapy arm were not statistically different from those in the WBRTfirst arm (overall response rate, 28.0% vs 39.1%; progression-free survival, 3.6
months vs 4.4 months; overall survival, 9.1 months vs 9.9 months). There was
close correlation noted between intracranial and extracranial tumor responses
(k 5 0.82). However, in the WBRT-first arm, grade 3 of 4 neutropenia was more
frequent (79% vs 40%) during chemotherapy and 4 patients (17.4%) did not
receive further chemotherapy because of early death or poor performance after
WBRT. Cognitive function appeared to deteriorate during primary chemotherapy,

CONCLUSIONS. Primary chemotherapy is more feasible and can be an appropriate
option for patients with synchronous brain metastasis when neurologic symptoms or signs are absent or controlled. The role and timing of WBRT should be

because of improvement in imaging technology and
better control of systemic disease. Among metastatic
brain tumors, lung cancer is the most common primary tumor site,1,2 and 25% to 30% of newly diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
have synchronous brain metastases at the time of initial presentation.3 Traditionally, the primary treatment
for brain metastasis in NSCLC patients has been
whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and only for a limited number of patients have surgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery been used, whereas systemic
chemotherapy has been believed to be of limited
value. This was mainly because of the long-held belief
that the brain is a pharmacologic sanctuary site, which
has been challenged by clinical observation of contrast
enhancement of the brain metastases on computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)4 and also by the documentation of objective
tumor responses in the brain after conventional chemotherapy.5,6 In fact, for brain lesions originating from
such chemosensitive tumors as germ cell tumors or
lymphoma, chemotherapy is considered to be the primary mode of treatment. Nevertheless, for NSCLC,
which is believed to be less responsive to chemotherapy than the others, systemic chemotherapy had been
considered only when the surgery, radiosurgery, or
WBRT was deemed inappropriate or had failed.
However, recent improvement in systemic treatment for NSCLC patients, including chemotherapy
and molecular-targeted therapy, made us re-evaluate
the role of systemic treatment as primary therapy for
those with synchronous brain metastasis, especially
when there is symptomatic systemic disease and/or
there are no or mild neurologic symptoms or signs.
In this randomized pilot study, we aimed to investigate whether primary chemotherapy was feasible
and affected by the time of WBRT in terms of its efficacy, toxicity profile, quality of life, and survival outcomes in this clinical setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
The main eligibility criteria were pathologically confirmed NSCLC and clinically silent brain metastases
for which surgery was not deemed appropriate or
indicated either because of the number (ie, 3) or
the location of metastatic lesions (ie, the brain metastases located in the critical area that might cause
significant neurological sequel after resection). ‘Clinically silent’ brain metastasis was defined as the lesion
from which patients had no or minimum neurologic
symptoms or signs, which were easily controlled by
supportive care only, including the administration of

corticosteroids. Additional eligibility criteria were as
follows: 1) ages 18 to 75 years; 2) Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of
0 to 2; 3) bidimensionally measurable lesion(s) in
both intracranial and extracranial site; 4) adequate
bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functions, defined as
a white blood cell count 4000/mm3, an absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) 1500/mm3, platelet count
100,000/mm3, hemoglobin 10 mg/dL, alanine
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase
2.5 times the upper limit of normal, serum bilirubin
1.2 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL; and
5) neither prior chemotherapy nor molecular-targeted
therapy. All patients provided written informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the National Cancer Center Korea. The study followed
the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Treatment Plan
After stratification according to ECOG PS (0–1 vs 2),
the number of intracranial metastases (<3 vs 3),
and the presence of extracranial extrathoracic metastasis (absence vs presence), eligible patients were
randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: chemotherapyfirst followed by WBRT or WBRT first followed by
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine at a dose of 900 mg/m2 and vinorelbine at a
dose of 25 mg/m2, which was given on Days 1 and 8
and repeated every 3 weeks.7 WBRT consisted of 30
grays (Gy) given in 10 fractions over 12 days.8 In the
primary chemotherapy arm, chemotherapy was given
up to 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal, followed by
WBRT, which was given regardless of the development of neurologic symptoms or signs. In the WBRTfirst arm, chemotherapy was initiated after at least 2
weeks of rest after the completion of WBRT, and only
when ANC was 1500/mm3, the platelet count was
100,000/mm3, and all nonhematologic toxicities
except alopecia recovered to grade 0 or 1. It was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal, or for a maximum of 6 cycles.
Response and Toxicity Evaluation
A complete history and physical examination, including documentation of concomitant medications and
ECOG PS, standard laboratory studies, and electrocardiogram was performed within 14 days before
study entry. Chest x-ray, CT scans of the chest
including the upper abdomen, MRI of the brain, and
radionuclide bone scan were performed within 4
weeks before study entry. Before the commencement
of chemotherapy, the same examinations performed

Chemotherapy for NSCLC With Brain Metastasis/Lee et al.

in the baseline assessment were repeated when WBRT
had been given first.
Objective tumor response was assessed according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria every cycle by chest X-ray and every 2 cycles by
chest CT and brain MRI.9 The intracranial tumor
response was also assessed using the same diagnostic
technique as in the baseline assessment and compared
with that of extracranial tumors. Toxicity was graded
every cycle using version 2.0 of the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC).10
Quality-of-life (QoL) was measured using the
European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30
(version 3.0).11 An additional lung cancer module,
Quality of Life Questionnaire LC13, was used.12 All of
the scales and single-item measures range in scores
from 0 to 100, and a high score represents a higher
response level. Thus, a high score for a functional
scale and the global health status represents a
healthy level of functioning and high QoL, but a high
score for a symptom scale or item represents high
level of symptomatology. The QoL questionnaire was
administered at baseline, immediately before the
initiation of every cycle of chemotherapy, and at the
end of study. The questionnaire was to be completed
during office visits before any other evaluations or
assessment of adverse events.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as
the interval between the date of the start of chemotherapy and the date of documented disease progression or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS)
was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of death because of any
cause. If a patient was lost to follow-up, that patient
was censored at the last date of contact.

Statistical Analysis
This was a 2-arm, open-label, prospective, single-center randomized pilot study. All patients were included
in all efficacy and safety analyses. The parameters of
interest were estimated and are presented with their
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using exact binomial probabilities. All time-to-event variables were
analyzed using Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival
estimates. Changes in QoL scores from baseline score
were evaluated using a Student t test for paired data.
Data were updated as of July 15, 2007.

otherapy arm, all patients received WBRT after disease
progression or completion of scheduled chemotherapy but none of them demonstrated progressive neurologic symptoms or signs when WBRT was initiated.
In the WBRT-first arm, 4 patients (17.4%) could not
receive any chemotherapy because of deterioration of
performance status (2 patients) or early death (2
patients), defined as death during or within 4 weeks
after the completion of WBRT, whereas the other 19
patients received the same chemotherapy according
to the protocol. In the primary chemotherapy arm, after WBRT, 10 patients could not receive further chemotherapy because of deterioration of ECOG PS (7
patients) or early death (3 patients).

Response and Survival
There was no difference in overall response rates
noted between the 2 arms (Table 2). In the primary
chemotherapy arm, intracranial tumor responses to
chemotherapy were found to be closely correlated
with extracranial tumor responses (k 5 0.82) (Table
2). With a median follow-up of 40 months (range,
20–59), there were no statistically significant differences noted in PFS after chemotherapy (3.6 months
in the primary chemotherapy arm vs 4.4 months in
the WBRT-first arm B; log-rank P 5.62) and the median
survival times after the randomization (9.1 months in

WBRT-first arm; log-rank P 5 .61) (Fig. 1).

Toxicity and QoL
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred more frequently
in the WBRT-first arm (79% vs 40%; P 5 .014). The
frequencies of other severe toxicities were not statistically significantly different except for alopecia and
mild headache or dizziness, which was more frequent in the WBRT-first arm (Table 3).
To evaluate the impact of the primary chemotherapy versus the WBRT-first treatment plan, we
assessed the QoL parameters in 33 patients, starting
from the 16th patient onward, using the EORTC
questionnaire C30 and L13. At baseline, before the
initiation of either chemotherapy or WBRT, global
health status was found to be most impaired in both
groups, although statistically not different, with
mean scores of 58 and 65, respectively. The function
scores or symptom scores were also statistically not
different between the 2 groups. After WBRT, global
health status was found to be statistically significantly impaired, with a decreased mean score of 48
from 65, and physical and cognitive function were
also more impaired. Of interest, as chemotherapy
proceeded, cognitive function in the primary chemotherapy arm became impaired, whereas that in the
WBRT-first arm rather improved slightly from the
most impaired score immediately after WBRT. The
changes are shown in Figure 2.
Salvage Therapy on Progression
Of the 25 patients randomized to the primary chemotherapy arm, 15 (60.0%) received further salvage
chemotherapy after the frontline gemcitabine/vinorelbine therapy and WBRT. Regimens used in the sal-

cisplatin (n 5 6 patients), paclitaxel plus cisplatin (n
5 2 patients), docetaxel plus capecitabine (n 5 2
patients), docetaxel plus cisplatin (n 5 1 patient),
single-agent docetaxel (n 5 2 patients), and gefitinib
(n 5 2 patients). Of the 23 patients in the WBRT-first
arm, 19 (82.6%) received gemcitabine/vinorelbine
therapy as first-line chemotherapy per protocol and
12 (52.3%) received further salvage chemotherapy.
Regimens used in salvage second-line setting
included irinotecan plus cisplatin (n 5 4 patients),
paclitaxel plus cisplatin (n 5 1 patient), docetaxel
plus cisplatin (n 5 2 patients), docetaxel plus capecitabine (n 5 1 patient), and gefitinib (n 5 4 patients).
Of interest, none of the patients in either group
demonstrated a deterioration in neurologic signs or
symptoms during the chemotherapy follow-up period. No patient required any surgical resection or
stereotactic radiosurgery during this period.

increased the incidence of NSCLC patients with brain
metastasis13 but also forced clinicians to face a new
dilemma with regard to the choice of initial treatment for the patients who have ‘clinically silent’
brain metastasis. In this randomized clinical trial,
although closed prematurely because of slow patient
accrual, we clearly demonstrated that those patients
with minimum or no neurologic symptoms or signs
from brain metastases could be treated with systemic
chemotherapy alone as an initial treatment without
jeopardizing their clinical outcome parameters.
Rather, our data suggest that NSCLC patients with
brain metastases might benefit from primary chemotherapy in terms of toxicity and QoL parameters
when compared with the conventional a WBRT-first
approach.
Furthermore, current study data also suggest that
both primary and delayed WBRT adversely affect the
clinical outcome of those patients with brain metastases. Traditionally, WBRT has been recommended
for all patients with metastatic brain lesions, regardless of neurologic signs or symptoms. As shown in
this prospectively collected dataset and also by our
clinical practices, nearly all patients experience deterioration in PS after WBRT, which in turn results in
compromised further systemic treatment. In our
study, 4 patients (17.4%) in the WBRT-first arm could

not receive any chemotherapy because of deterioration of PS and/or death, and 10 patients (40.0%) in
the primary chemotherapy arm could not receive further systemic treatment because of the same reason
after WBRT.
Conversely, all patients participating in this study
received WBRT per protocol. This may in part
explain why no patient required additional treatment
such as surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery
for the brain lesions while on the study and thereafter. It should also be noted that none of the
patients in the primary chemotherapy arm had worsening of neurologic symptoms or signs while receiving therapy even when there was progression of the
brain lesions documented by radiologic imaging
techniques.
In the current study, QoL data should be interpreted with some precautionary remarks because it
was based on the unbalanced open-label study outcome and a small sample size. Nevertheless, there
were statistically significant changes in the scores
indicating deterioration of QoL parameters after
WBRT was given first. Taken together with the finding
that WBRT resulted in a significant increase in chemotherapy-related grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,14 one may
reserve the WBRT for future use as long as the brain
metastases are controlled with systemic chemother-

apy. This appears to be a quite reasonable approach
when the recent advances in systemic chemotherapy
and molecular-targeted therapy are taken into consideration, which has been shown to improve both
overall survival and QoL of lung cancer patients.15–20
In fact, while this trial was still actively accruing
patients, we had 4 separate phase 2 primary chemotherapy trials running sequentially,21–23 which accrued a total of 187 NSCLC patients. Among those,
32 patients had brain metastases and were initially
treated with chemotherapy alone without WBRT. The
eligibility criteria were basically the same as the current randomized trial, although the chemotherapy
regimens were different for each trial. Their median
survival time of 10.6 months is quite similar to the
results of the current study (9.1 months in the primary chemotherapy arm vs 9.9 months in the WBRTfirst arm), although it tended to be shorter than the
result for the patients without brain metastasis (10.6
months vs 15.7 months; log-rank P 5 .089). Of inter-

est, of the 32 patients with brain metastases who
were enrolled in those primary chemotherapy trials,
9 (28%) did not receive WBRT at all during their disease course and their cause of death was progressive
systemic disease rather than the progression of metastatic brain lesions. Their survival outcome was not
different from the result of the other 23 patients who
received WBRT (median survival time, 11.3 months
vs 9.8 months; log-rank P 5 .345). As we gained more
clinical experience, it became apparent that WBRT
was not always necessary for patients with asymptomatic brain metastases, and also it became hard to
keep randomizing the patients to the WBRT-first
arm. We therefore decided to close this randomized
clinical trial and report the data herein.
In the current study and also in our competing
studies, we observed that the response of the intracranial lesions correlated very closely with that of the
extracranial lesions, which suggests that at least
the clinically silent metastatic brain lesions can be

Chemotherapy for NSCLC With Brain Metastasis/Lee et al.

treated as 1 of systemic manifestation of the disease.
It also suggests that more effective chemotherapeutic
agents should enhance the intracranial tumor
responses. Because such molecular-targeted agents
as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosinekinase inhibitors demonstrated very high response
rates in a selected subset of patients,24–26 one may
use them as primary therapy instead of chemotherapy for those patients with specific biologic markers
(ie, EGFR gene mutation) or clinical characteristics
(ie, never-smoker adenocarcinoma), which should be
investigated further.
Based on the results of current study, we conclude that primary chemotherapy for brain metastases is feasible and advisable, more so than primary
WBRT, for NSCLC patients who present with clinically silent brain metastasis. There is no reason to
believe otherwise that the same principle would be
applicable to the management of other types of cancer provided there are reasonably effective systemic
treatment regimens available.
