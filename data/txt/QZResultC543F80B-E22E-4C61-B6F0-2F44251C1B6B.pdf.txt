ABSTRACT
Non-random gains of chromosome 5p have been observed in clinically aggressive
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whereas the driving oncogenes on 5p remain to be
characterized. We used an integrative genomic and functional approach to identify
amplified oncogenes on 5p and to evaluate the relevance of AMACR amplification at
5p13.3 and its overexpression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Thirty-seven tumor
samples, imatinib-sensitive GIST882 cell line, and imatinib-resistant GIST48 cell line
were analyzed for DNA imbalances using array-based genomic profiling. Forty-one
fresh tumor samples of various risk categories were enriched for pure tumor cells by
laser capture microdissection and quantified for AMACR mRNA expression. AMACRspecific fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were both
informative in tissue microarray sections of 350 independent primary gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, including 213 cases with confirmed KIT /PDGFRA genotypes. To
assess the oncogenic functions of AMACR, GIST882 and GIST48 cell lines were stably
silenced against their endogenous AMACR expression. In 59% of cases featuring 5p
gains, two major amplicons encompassed discontinuous chromosomal regions that
were differentially overrepresented in high-risk cases, including the one harboring the
mRNA-upregulated AMACR gene. Gene amplification was detected in 19.7% of cases

(69/350) and strongly related to protein overexpression (p<0.001), although 52%
of AMACR-overexpressing cases exhibited no amplification. Both gene amplification
and protein overexpression were significantly associated with epithelioid histology,
larger size, increased mitoses, higher risk levels, and unfavorable genotypes (all
p≦0.03). They were also independently predictive of decreased disease-free survival
(overexpression, p<0.001; amplification, p=0.020) in the multivariate analysis.
Concomitant with downregulated cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK4, AMACR knockdown
suppressed cell proliferation and induced G1-phase arrest, but did not affect apoptosis
in both GIST882 and GIST48 cells. In conclusion, AMACR amplification is a mechanism
driving increased mRNA and protein expression and conferring aggressiveness
through heightened cell proliferation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

INTRODUCTION

GIST samples, including 22 previously published cases
[22]. We gave special emphasis to chromosome 5, which
displayed differentially gained regions on both arms in
high-risk GISTs. Given recurrent gains spanning its DNA
locus with significantly increased mRNA expression
in higher-risk GISTs, we specifically selected alphamethylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) at 5p13.3 to
evaluate its biological and clinical relevance in cell lines
and independent samples.
As a cofactor-independent peroxisomal and
mitochondrial enzyme, AMACR acts as a gatekeeper for
the β-oxidation of dietary branched-chain fatty acids and
bile acid synthesis [23]. The oncogenic role of AMACR
in driving tumor growth was first unraveled in prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinomas by cDNA
microarray analysis [24-26], which, albeit with variable
prognostic implication, was subsequently reported in
several other carcinoma types [27-30]. However, little
is known about the mechanisms underpinning AMACR
overexpression that causes metabolic deregulation in
cancers. In this study, we characterize gene amplification
as a mechanism that drives AMACR overexpression
with negative prognostic consequences in GISTs. In
two AMACR-expressing cell lines, RNA interference
substantiated a cell cycle-arresting effect linked to
the concomitantly downregulated cyclin D1, cyclin
E, and CDK4, thus providing a mechanistic basis for
the proliferation-enhancing function of AMACR in
promoting GIST progression. Moreover, overexpressed
AMACR might represent a potential therapeutic target in
imatinib-resistant GISTs, for which we found that a nonsubstrate-based covalent inactivator of AMACR resulted
in reduced viability of one such cell model (GIST48) with
concomitant G1 arrest and cell apoptosis.

As the most common mesenchymal tumors of
the digestive tract, gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GISTs) are believed to derive from interstitial Cajal
cells or their precursors [1, 2]. Mutations of the KIT or
PDGFRA genes, leading to constitutive activation of the
encoded receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), are present
but mutually exclusive in the vast majority of GISTs,
driving tumor inception and dictating treatment response
to imatinib [2, 3] . The KIT/PDGFRA genotypes have been
reported to be variably associated with aggressiveness of
resected imatinib-naïve GISTs, while their prognostic
value was not uniformly validated in prior studies [4-10].
Through deleted tumor suppressor genes and amplified
oncogenes, sequential accumulation of chromosomal
imbalances further contribute to the aggressiveness of
GISTs in tumor evolution [11-14]. Although the NIH risk
scheme has proven prognostically useful, more accurate
prognostication is becoming a critical issue in the postimatinib era, for the purpose of counseling for outcomes
and identifying targetable aberrant molecules other than
RTKs [8, 15-19].
Conventional and array-based comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) studies have indicated
that chromosomal losses are more prevalent than gains in
most GISTs, especially -14q and -22q known as the early
cytogenetic events [12-14, 20, 21]. In contrast, the losses
of other chromosomal regions or arms, such as -1p, -9p,
and -9q, preferentially occur in aggressive GISTs with
or without concomitant chromosomal gains, particularly
+5p, +5q, and +8q [12-14]. Of these chromosomal
aberrations occurring at later stages, we previously
profiled the DNA copy number alterations on chromosome
9 and characterized the clinical relevance of homozygous
MATP gene deletion at 9p21.3 in GISTs [22]. However,
the individual prognostic implications of different
chromosomal gains in GISTs have been inconsistent
in the literature and the derived candidate oncogenes
remain largely undefined [11-14]. To search for candidate
oncogenes relevant to tumor progression, we performed
global genomic profiling analysis of two cell lines and 37

RESULTS

In line with the previous literature [11, 12, 14], the most
common chromosomal aberration (Figure-1A) was -14,
as detected in 82.1% of the samples. Other common
recurrent alterations with variable extent of involvement
included -15, +7, -22q, and -1p in 60-80 % of samples,
+5p, +5q, +8q, and +12p in 40-60%, and -9p, +16p,
-10q, and -11p in 20-40%. Of these, the differential
alterations significantly prevalent in high-risk GISTs and
cell lines included -1p, -9p, +5p, +8q, +5q, +7, +12p,
+16p, -10q, and -11p (Figure-1B, Table-S2). In 59% of
samples, prominent DNA gains were found to involve 5p
wherein discontinuous chromosomal regions differentially
overrepresented in high-risk GISTs were mainly

High-risk GISTs displayed differentially increased
AMACR gene copies in genomic profiling and
were associated with higher levels of AMACR
mRNA
Chromosomal imbalances of varying degrees were
detected in all samples subjected to aCGH profiling. Using
Nexus software, we identified more recurrent regions of
deletions than gains in GISTs across the whole genome.

Figure-1: (A) Profiling of genome-wide copy number imbalances in 39 samples. By applying Nexus software, DNA copy

number gains (blue) and losses (red) in GISTs are shown in the upward and downward directions, respectively, along the horizontal
coordinate of individual chromosomes. The frequency plot of gains and losses is shown in the vertical axis. Generally concordant with the
reported literature, the most frequent chromosomal aberration is -14, seen in more than 80% of samples we evaluated, followed by -15,
+7, -22q, and -1p. (B) Identification of significant differential chromosomal aberrations. As compared to the 23 low/intermediate-risk
samples, the following copy number imbalances, including -1p, -9p, +5p, +8q, +5q, +7, +12p, +16p, -10q, and -11p, are at least 25% more
frequent in high-risk and cell line samples of GIST, with a p-value <0.05. (C) Copy number alterations on 5p featuring gains of genomic
DNA targeting the AMACR gene at 5p13.3. Upper panel: The cytoband of chromosome 5 is shown on the top. Varying length of gained
regions were detected in 59% of samples. The chromosomal regions differentially overrepresented in high-risk cases were mainly clustered
in 5p15.33-p15.1 and 5p13.3-p12 (upper). Of the latter amplicon harboring 120 named genes, the locus of AMACR was at the 5p13.3 region
(green vertical rectangle) with increased copies in 25% of samples. Lower panel: Representative samples with the amplified AMACR gene
are illustrated in the zoom-in view. The unit in the vertical axis is the log2 ratio of copy number alterations. (D) Quantitative RT- PCR
assay shows that fold expression of AMACR mRNA in the pure tumor cells from fresh samples is the most abundant in high-risk GISTs
classified by the NIH grading scheme, followed by intermediate-risk and then by low-risk cases.

the FISH assay, AMACR amplification (69/350, 19.7%)
was strongly related to AMACR immunohistochemical
overexpression (132/350, 37.7%) (Figure-2A, Table-1,
p<0.001). However, 52.3% (69/132) of AMACRoverexpressing tumors were not amplified at the AMACR
locus, implying that alternative regulatory mechanism(s)
drive AMACR overexpression. As seen in Table-1,
those GISTs harboring amplified AMACR genes and
overexpressed AMACR protein were strongly associated
with the presence of epithelioid cells, large tumor size,
higher mitotic rate (Figure-2B), and higher NIH risk levels
(all p≦0.003). Moreover, both AMACR amplification
(p=0.030) and AMACR overexpression (p=0.022) were
related to unfavorable RTK genotypes (Figure-2C) and
strongly predictive of worse DFS at the univariate level
(Figure-3, Table-2, both p<0.0001). In multivariate
analysis (Table-2), both AMACR amplification (p=0.020,
hazard ratio: 2.005) and AMACR overexpression
(p<0.001, hazard ratio: 3.728) remained independently
prognostic of worse outcomes, together with higher NIH
risk levels (p<0.001), presence of epithelioid histology
(p=0.006), and unfavorable RTK genotypes (p=0.047).
In our cohort, we further examined the influence of
the NCCN guideline (15) on both correlative and survival

distributed in 5p15.33-p15.1 and 5p13.3-p12 (Figure-1C,
upper). In the latter amplicon, 25% of high-risk GIST
and cell line samples, but none of the low/intermediaterisk group, displayed increased copies of the AMACR
gene in the 5p13.3 region (Figure-1C, lower, Table-S3).
To elucidate whether AMACR was not only a passenger
accompanied by +5p, we quantified AMACR mRNA in
LCM-isolated tumor cells from fresh samples and found a
significantly higher expression level in samples of higher
risk categories (Figure-1D, p=0.01).

AMACR gene amplification and protein
overexpression were associated with each other,
with unfavorable clinicopathological factors and
RTK genotypes, and worse outcomes
Next, we analyzed the clinical relevance of the
AMACR gene copy number and its protein expression in a
validation set of independent primary resected, imatinibnaïve GISTs. There were 350 GISTs with informative data
for both assays that were available for clinical follow-up,
comprising 127 very low/low-risk, 110 intermediaterisk, and 113 high-risk cases defined by NIH scheme. In

analyses, demonstrating very similar results and statistical
power to those defined by NIH risk scheme. AMACR
protein overexpression and AMACR gene amplification
(p<0.001 for both) were still highly associated with
increasing risk levels (Table-S4). In the multivariate model
(Table-S5), both AMACR amplification (p=0.033, hazard

To gain insight into the biology, we next
characterized the imatinib-sensitive GIST882 cells and
imatinib-resistant GIST48 cells for their endogenous
AMACR expression. The AMACR locus revealed a lowlevel copy number gain in GIST48 cells but remained
unaltered in GIST882 cells in aCGH profiling. However,

(A) Compared to primary HCSMC cells, endogenous AMACR mRNA (upper) and protein (lower) expression is higher in GIST882 and
GIST48 cell lines (left panel). The two cell lines are stably silenced against endogenous AMACR expression by a lentiviral vector bearing
one of the two AMACR shRNAs with different sequences for both GIST882 (middle panel) and GIST48 (right panel) cells. The efficiency
of RNA silencing is confirmed by both quantitative RT-PCR (upper row) and western blotting (lower row) assays. The shLacZ plasmid,
POLR2A transcript, and GADPH protein are utilized as controls in RNA interference, quantitative RT-PCR, and western blotting assays,
respectively. (B) Using an ELISA-based, colorimetric assay to assess the rate of BrdUrd uptake, cell proliferation is significantly reduced
in stable AMACR-knockdown GIST882 (left) and GIST48 (right) cell lines, compared to the corresponding shLacZ controls. (C) Western
blotting assay validates that Cyclin D1, CDK4, and cyclin E are consistently downregulated in protein abundance in both AMACRknockdown GIST882 and GIST48 cell lines. (D) Representative flow cytometric experiments show the induction of G1 cell cycle arrests by
shAMACR in GIST cells. Two stable clones each of AMACR-knockdown GIST882 (upper) and GIST48 (lower) cells display a cell cycle
arrest primarily occurring in the G1 phase.

shAMACR or shLacZ control were further quantitated for
CCND1, CCNE1, and CDK4 mRNAs, and all significantly
decreased in expression levels, indicating an AMACRmodulated transcriptional activation of these cell cyclepromoting mediators (Figure-S1). To clarify whether
this growth-promoting effect might be linked to the prosurvival function, we performed flow cytometric analysis
with annexin V/propidium iodine staining, which showed
no apparent effect of AMACR expression on evasion of
apoptosis (Figure-5)

endogenous expression levels of AMACR mRNA and
protein were significantly higher in both GIST cell lines
using HCSMC primary cells as the baseline reference
(Figure-4A, left). This observation was in keeping with the
finding of human samples showing AMACR amplification
in about a half of AMACR-overexpressing cases, and
similarly implies alternative amplification-independent
mechanism(s). We thus employed RNA interference to
decipher the functional effects of AMACR overexpression,
and remarkable silencing of AMACR expression was
achieved in selected stable clones of GIST882 (Figure-4A,
middle) and GIST48 cells (Figure-4A, right).
Compared with their shLacZ controls, the BrdUrd
incorporation rates in both stable AMACR-silenced
GIST882 and GIST48 cells were significantly attenuated
(Figure-4B). This finding indicated the growth-promoting
role of AMACR and prompted us to further explore its
mediators and effect on cell cycle regulation. In western
blotting assays, the expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin
E, and CDK4 proteins were concomitantly downregulated
in both AMACR-knockdown GIST cell lines (Figure-4C),
findings concordant with the result of cell cycle arrest
in the G1 phase determined by flow cytometry (Figure4D). The AMACR-amplified GIST48 cells treated with

Imatinib-resistant GIST48 cells were sensitive to
ebselen oxide (EO) in vitro
EO is a non-substrate-based covalent inactivator of
AMACR and has selective toxicity to AMACR-expressing
prostatic cancer cells in vitro [31]. To test whether
AMACR is potential alternative therapeutic target in
imatinib-resistant GISTs, we characterized the inhibiting
effect of EO on the imatinib-resistant, AMACR-amplified
GIST48 cell line and found significantly diminished cell
viability, with the IC50 approximating 10 μM (FigureS2A). Moreover, flow cytometric analysis revealed that

Figure-5: AMACR-knockdown does not induce cell apoptosis in AMACR-expressing GIST cell lines. In both GIST882

(upper) and GIST48 (lower) cell lines, the cell percentages in the early and late stages of apoptosis analyzed by annexin V//propidium
iodine staining are not significantly different between shLacZ controls and shAMACR-treated cells in three independent assays.

mostly regulated by various transcriptional factors, such
as C/EBP family members, Sp1, and ZNF202 [23, 37,
38]. Recently, the downregulation of miR-26a was first
found to link to the increased AMACR expression level
in prostatic adenocarcinomas, and AMACR was further
validated by functional assays to be a novel target of this
tumor suppressive microRNA [39]. In this context, it may
be of interest to examine the expression and significance
of the aforementioned transcriptional factors and miR-26a
in future study on GIST samples and cell lines.
The biological function of amplificationdriven AMACR overexpression remains undefined in
mesenchymal neoplasms. Recently, several lines of
evidence have linked the racemase activity of AMACR to
alterations in cancer cell behavior [26]. RNA interference
showed that high AMACR protein concentration promoted
cell proliferation of prostate carcinomas through its
enhanced enzymatic activity in an androgen-independent
manner [26]. In GISTs, both AMACR amplification and
AMACR overexpression were associated with larger
tumor size, higher mitotic count, and higher risk levels
defined by the NIH grading scheme. These factors are
established adverse clincopathological prognosticators in
GISTs, not only reported in the literature [1, 17-19] but
also reaffirmed in this series. Intriguingly, we also found
that increased AMACR gene copies and protein level were
significantly related to the presence of epithelioid cells,
another independent adverse factor we identified. Despite
being reported as a poor univariate or even multivariate
prognosticator, the real impact of this cytomorphological
phenotype was variable in the literature [40-42], probably
because of the inconsistent criteria to define “epithelioid”.
Notably, a subset of predominantly epithelioid GISTs with
PDGFRA mutations is characterized by prominent myxoid
stroma, gastric location, and indolent behavior [43], which
should be distinct from those aggressive GISTs exhibiting
varying proportions of epithelioid cells but lacking
PDGFRA mutations and apparent preference for gastric
location. Interestingly, both AMACR amplification and
AMACR overexpression were also significantly related
to unfavorable RTK genotypes, another independent
predictor of worse DFS in our study and some of
the previous series [4, 8, 9]. However, the molecular
underpinning of this association is not clear, meriting
further in vitro study of the biological effect of various
RTK mutants on the regulation of AMACR expression in
GIST cell lines that are not AMACR-amplified.
Of clinical relevance was the finding that both
AMACR amplification and AMACR overexpression
were independent negative prognosticators in primary
resected, imatinib-naïve GISTs. These implications are
mostly ascribed to the pro-proliferative attributes of
AMACR for the maintenance of malignant phenotypes,
rather than its effect on the modulation of cell apoptosis.
In both AMACR-expressing GIST cell lines, shAMACR
specifically impaired BrdUrd uptake, irrespective of

DISCUSSION
In a variety of human neoplasms, including
tumors of connective tissue origin, there are several
complex amplicons on 5p with multiple discontinuous
gained regions encompassing potential driver genes [3235]. Based on the conventional comparative genomic
hybridization studies, 5p gain represents non-random
chromosomal alterations in GISTs that preferentially occur
in the later stages of tumor evolution and have variable
prognostic impacts [12, 13]. In our oligonucleotide-based
aCGH profiling, the ultra-high resolution and sufficient
sample number enabled refined mapping of genomewide CNAs that were differentially involved in highrisk samples. Of the aberrant DNA gains, +5p (59.0%),
following +7p (71.2%), ranked second in frequency of
involvement in our series, and its regions of differential
prevalence in high-risk samples were mainly distributed
in two separate amplicons spanning 5p15.33-p15.1 and
5p13.3-p12, respectively.
To meet the definition of a genuine tumor-associated
amplified oncogene, a candidate is required to consistently
express the encoded mRNA and protein that in turn confer
growth advantages on cancer cells in which it is amplified
[36]. Among the candidates on 5p, we have characterized
AMACR at 5p13.3 as a potential amplification-driven
oncogene by showing that it has upregulated mRNA
with a higher expression level in fresh GIST samples
classified as high-risk. In our large independent validation
cohort, increased AMACR gene copies and protein
overexpression were demonstrated in an aggressive subset
of human GISTs. Our in vitro assays further reinforced
the oncogenic function of AMACR, which promotes an
aggressive phenotype and disease progression through
heightened cell proliferation.
AMACR is indispensable in the catabolism of
phytol-derived, branched-chain fatty acids and was first
identified to be aberrantly overexpressed in prostatic
carcinomas [23-26]. To understand the growth advantage
of the resultant metabolic deregulation, we should
elucidate the molecular basis underlying AMACR
overexpression, since most malignancies increase the need
for fatty acids as an energy source [23, 30]. Using FISH,
we have validated AMACR amplification in approximately
20% of GISTs, and AMACR amplification was notably
reflected at the protein level and strongly correlated with
immunohistochemical overexpression. However, alterative
regulatory mechanism(s) other than increased gene copies
are very likely to operate in a subset of GISTs, since 52%
of AMACR-overexpressing cases in our samples showed
no gene amplification by FISH. Moreover, the expression
level of AMACR in common carcinomas is known to be

vitro, imatinib-resistant, AMACR-amplified GIST48 cells
were dose-dependently susceptible to EO with declined
cell viability, induction of cellular apoptosis, and cell cycle
arrest at the G1 phase. The combination of these effects
may account for the potential anti-tumor activity of EO in
imatinib-resistant GISTs, although there is still room for
improving the drug potency of EO, given its modest IC50
values at the scale of μM.
In short, AMACR has been substantiated as an
amplification-driven oncogene in GISTs, given its
risk level-associated mRNA upregulation and the in
vitro evidence of a proliferation-promoting function
in AMACR-expressing cell lines. Both AMACR gene
amplification and protein overexpression are associated
with adverse clincopathological factors and independently
predictive of inferior DFS in primary localized, imatinibnaïve GISTs. However, AMACR protein overexpression is
approximately twice as prevalent as its gene amplification
in GISTs, implying the operation of alterative regulatory
mechanism(s) other than increased gene copies.
Elucidating the molecular underpinning of AMACR
overexpression in GISTs may open an alterative avenue
of targeted therapy for those imatinib-resistant GISTs of
high-risk aggressiveness.

their gene status. Given that sustained cell growth is a
fundamental hallmark of cancer [44], it was interesting to
find that stable silencing of AMACR expression resulted in
concomitantly downregulated protein expression of cyclin
D1, CDK4, and cyclin E. In virtue of their significantly
decreased mRNA expression levels in the AMACRsilenced GIST cells, this finding was likely operated
at the transcriptional level and might partly provide a
mechanistic basis for the induced G1-phase arrest seen in
both AMACR-silenced GIST cell lines, hence confirming
the oncogenic role of AMACR in driving uncontrolled cell
proliferation.
In AMACR-expressing prostatic cancer cell lines,
Festuccia et al. reported that trifluoroibuprofen, an
AMACR inhibitor structurally analogous to ibuprofen,
enabled the suppression of AMACR expression with
concomitant cyclin D1 downregulation [45]. In this regard,
their findings were similar to the effect of shAMACR
on GIST cell lines. Although we found G1-phase arrest
without apoptosis in AMACR-silenced GIST cells,
trifluoroibuprofen-treated prostatic cancer cells exhibited
G2/M-phase arrest and induction of apoptosis with reduced
expression of pro-apoptotic survivin [45]. Compared with
RNA interference, there are usually more variegated
phenotype-modulating effects of chemical inhibitors on
cancer cells, which may account for the variability in the
drug-induced cell cycle-arresting phenomenon and are not
ideal to be used for specifically elucidating the regulatory
function of a single molecule in cancer biology. Along
this line, we speculated that the AMACR-induced cell
cycle progression might be operated by more diverse
mechanisms, perhaps indirect and cell type-dependent,
given the previously reported G2/M cell cycle arrest in
AMACR-silenced LAPC-4 prostatic cancer cells [26] .
In most GISTs treated with imatinib, the median
duration of partial remission or disease stabilization
lasts for approximately 1.5 to 2 years, because of the
development of secondary kinase domain mutations
in KIT and/or PDGFRA genes [46-48]. Moreover, in
these imatinib-resistant GISTs, long-term remission
remains difficult to achieve using other tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [49]. Therefore, a broader understanding of the
mechanisms underlying deregulated cancer metabolism
may provide novel therapeutic strategies for these
refractory GISTs by targeting potential tumor-promoting
oncometabolites or associated metabolic enzymes [50].
In this context, AMACR may represent a promising
targetable metabolic driver, since deficiency of AMACR,
either in clinical or experimental settings, does not cause
detrimental morbidity and mortality in humans and
animal models [51, 52]. Moreover, a novel generation of
nonsubstrate-based, non-competitive AMACR inhibitors
have been recently identified [31]. Of these candidate
compounds, EO has been shown to enable covalent
inactivation of AMACR with potent cytotoxic selectivity
for AMACR-expression prostatic cancer cell lines [31]. In

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
GIST882 and GIST48 cell lines, kind gifts from
Professor Jonathan Fletcher, were cultured following
the published methods [53-55]. Briefly, GIST48 and
GIST882 cells were maintained in IMDM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100
U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 4 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen) at 37◦ C in 5% CO2. GIST882 was established
from an untreated GIST with a imatinib-sensitive K642E
mutation in KIT exon13. GIST48 was from a progressing
GIST on imatinib therapy with a homozygous V560D
mutation in KIT exon11 and a heterozygous D820A
mutation in KIT exon17. Primary human colonic smooth
muscle cells (HCSMC) were purchased from ScienCell
and maintained at 37◦C in smooth muscle cell medium
(ScienCell) containing 500 ml of basal medium, 10 ml of
FBS, 5 ml of smooth muscle cell growth supplement, and
5 ml of penicillin/streptomycin solution until the culture
was approximately 90% confluent.

Tumor materials
The institutional review boards of Chi-Mei (IRB09806-003) and Chang Gung (102-2314B) hospitals approved
this study. Together with GIST882 and GIST48 cell lines,
aCGH profiling was performed to analyze genome-wide

somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 37 fresh GIST
samples, including 10 low-risk, 13 intermediate-risk, and
14 high-risk cases classified by the NIH grading scheme
[1]. Of these, 22 had been previously reported for CNAs
on chromosome 9 [22].
To validate aCGH results, we retrieved formalinfixed blocks of 370 primary resected GISTs from
another cohort that were untreated by imatinib before
disease relapse and independent of fresh samples for
genomic profiling and AMACR mRNA quantification.
The representative tissue cores of these cases were
assembled into tissue microarrays (TMA), which were
recut for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting
the AMACR gene and AMACR immunostaining. Both
assays were informative in 350 cases, of which we
successfully determined RTK genotypes for 213, using
previously described methods [8, 22]. Clinicopathological
characteristics of the cohorts for aCGH analysis and for
validation of AMACR gene status and immunoexpression
are summarized in the supplementary Table-S1 and
Table-1, respectively.

(p<0.05, Student-t test).

Mutation analysis

TMA sections were heated by microwave to retrieve
tissue antigen, incubated with the primary antibody against
AMACR (1:350; Biocare Medical), and detected using a
ChemMate EnVision kit (Dako). One pathologist (JL)
independently assessed immunohistochemical results to
record a mean AMACR labeling index of cytoplasmic
expression for each case. AMACR overexpression was
defined as cases featuring 50% or more tumor cells with
moderate or strong cytoplasmic staining using a previously
reported scoring method [29].

FISH
The AMACR gene copy number in GIST tissue
samples was assessed on 4-μm TMA sections by locusspecific FISH. A laboratory-developed bacterial artificial
chromosome probe (CTD-2340N2, Invitrogen), spanning
AMACR at 5p13.3, was labeled with spectrum orange.
According to our prior genomic profiling data, there were
no CNAs at 19p12 where a region close to ZNF725 (CTB28I9, Invitrogen) was selected as the reference probe
and labeled with spectrum green. The average numbers
of red and green signals were determined by examining
approximately 200 tumor cells in triplicate tissue cores
for each specimen. Gene amplification was defined as a
ratio of the gene probe signal to the control probe signal
exceeding two.

Immunohistochemistry

The methods of DNA extraction, PCR amplification,
direct sequencing of KIT exon 11, and denatured high
performance liquid chromatography screening for exons
9, 13, and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12 and 18 of the
PDGFRA gene with confirmatory sequencing have been
previously described [8, 22].

Analysis of aCGH profiling

RNA interference

Thirty-three samples, including GIST882 and
GIST48 cell lines, were profiled using Human CGH 385K
Whole-Genome Tiling Array v1.0 (NimbleGen). Six
recently acquired samples, including one intermediate-risk
and five low-risk cases, were subjected to Human 3x720K
Whole Genome CGH (NimbleGen). The methods of DNA
preparation, hybridization, and aCGH data analysis used
were essentially as previously reported [22, 35]. Briefly,
we extracted 1 μg of genomic DNA each from cell
lines and fresh tumor samples for hybridization against
oligonucleotide-based microarrays. The raw data were
log2-transformed, exported, and integrated using Nexus
software (BioDiscovery) to profile the global somatic
CNAs and depict the zoom-in view of imbalanced genes
on 5p. To finely delineate the breakpoints in array probes,
gains and losses in significant regions of CNAs were
defined as log2 ratios of ≧ +0.20 or ≦ -0.20, respectively.
To search for causal genes linked to CNA-driven
deregulation in disease progression, chromosomal regions
were considered to be differentially altered when their
frequencies were at least 25% higher in the joint group
of high-risk and cell line samples than in the remainder

To establish stably silenced clones of AMACRamplified GIST882 and GIST48 cell lines with the
short-hairpin RNAs against AMACR expression
(shAMACR), the lentiviral vectors were obtained
from Taiwan National RNAi Core Facility,
including
pLKO.1-shLacZ
(TRCN0000072223:
5’-TGTTCGCATTAT
CCGAACCAT-3’)
and
pLKO.1-shAMACR
(TRCN0000084113:
5’CCACAAATTGTATGGTGAT -3’; TRCN0000084116:
5’- CGAAGAGATTTATCAGCTT -3’). Viruses were
produced by transfecting HEK293 cells with the above
three vectors using Lipofectamine 2000. For viral
infection, 3×106 GIST882 or GIST48 cells were incubated
with 8 ml lentivirus in the presence of polybrene, followed
by puromycin selection for stable clones of lentivirustransduced cells.

Quantification of AMACR transcript

Pharmacological assays

Real-time RT-PCR was performed using an ABI
StepOnePlus™ System to measure AMACR mRNA
abundance in laser capture microdissection (LCM)isolated tumor cells from 41 fresh GIST tissue samples,
including 21 high-risk, 13 intermediate-risk, and 7 lowrisk cases. RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
was used to extract total RNAs from primary human
colonic smooth muscle cells (HCSMC) and stable
clones of GIST cell lines with lentiviral vectors bearing
either shAMACR or shLacZ. The methods of total RNA
extraction from LCM-isolated GIST tumor cells was as
previously described [8]. RNAs were further reversetranscribed using SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Real-time PCR assay to
quantify the expression level of AMACR transcript was
performed using pre-designed TaqMan assay reagents
(AMACR Hs01091294_m1, CCND1 Hs00765553_m1,
CCNE1 Hs01026536_m1, CDK4 Hs01565683_g1,
and POLR2A [a.k.a, RNA polymerase polypeptide A]
Hs01108291_m1 from Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). The obtained data were normalized by the expression
of POLR2A housekeeping transcript. After normalization
to POLR2A, the relative expression fold of AMACR
transcript was then given by 2- ∆∆Cp, where ∆∆CT = ∆CT
(GIST cells)- ∆CT (calibrator), ∆CT represented the CT of AMACR
subtracted from the CT of POLR2A, and the calibrator was
HCSMC for cell lines and non-neoplastic gastric tissue
for microdissected tissue samples. Only samples with CT
value <32 for POLR2A were considered to have acceptable
RNA quality and included in the analyses.

Ebselen oxide (EO) was obtained from Sigma. We
seeded GIST48 cells in 96-well plates at a density of 5x103
cells/well the day before treatment with vehicle control
(0.9% saline) or EO at indicated concentrations (10 ~160
μM) for 72 h.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay to assess DNA
synthesis
DNA synthesis was assessed using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay-based and colorimetric
BrdU assay (Roche Diagnostics). AMACR-knockdown
or shLacZ control GIST882 and GIST48 cells were plated
into a 96-well plate at density of 3000 cells per well, and
DNA synthesis was evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 h. After
incubation with BrdU for 3 hours at 37°C under 5% CO2,
the labeling medium was removed, followed by fixation
and final incubation with anti-BrdU-POD solution. The
absorbance of the samples was measured using an ELISA
reader (Promega) at 450 nm, with the absorbance at 690
nm as reference.

Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle kinetics
Stable pools of AMACR-knockdown versus
corresponding shLacZ control GIST cell lines and GIST48
cells treated with EO or vehicle control were pelleted
and fixed overnight in 75% cold ethanol at −20°C. Cells
were washed twice in cold PBS containing 10 mg/ml of
DNase-free RNase. Afterwards, these cells were labeled
with propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 0.05
mg/ml and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) with WinMDI2.9 software to determine the
percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. In all
experiments, at least more than 104 cells were sorted after
gating out the fixation artifacts and cell debris.

Western blots
The western blotting assay was performed to
evaluate the endogenous AMACR expression and
the efficiency of AMACR knockdown in GIST882
and GIST48 cell lines. Cell lysates containing 25 μg
protein were separated by 4-12% gradient NuPAGE
gel (Invitrogen), transferred onto PVDF membranes
(Amersham), and probed with antibodies against GADPH
(1;3000, Chemicon), and proteins of interest. The latter
included anti-AMACR (1:250, Invitrogen), anti-cyclin
D1 (1:10000, Epitomics), anti-cyclin E (1:200, Abcam),
anti-CDK2 (1:2000, Epitomics), and anti-CDK4 (1:200,
Abcam). After incubation with the secondary antibody,
proteins were visualized by the chemiluminescence system
(Amersham).

Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis
For evaluation of cell apoptosis, 105 each of
GIST882 and GIST48 cells with shLacZ or shAMACR and
105 GIST48 cells treated with EO or vehicle control were
plated for 24 h and then incubated with Annexin V-FITC
kit (Bender MedSystems, CA) containing propidium
iodine for 15 min. The cell percentages at the stages of
early apoptosis and late apoptosis, and necrosis were
calculated from three independent experiments.

Statistical Analysis

GRANT SUPPORT

In the independent validation set, we evaluated
the associations of AMACR gene dosage and
AMACR immunoexpression with each other and with
clinicopathological factors using the Chi-square, Fisher’s
exact, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Followup data were available for 350 patients as of April 2009
(median, 49.9; range, 1–247). When last seen, 236 patients
were alive without relapsed disease, 87 developed tumor
relapses, including local recurrences in 64 and hepatic and/
or peritoneal dissemination in 43, 40 died of GISTs, and
26 died of unrelated causes. The end point was diseasefree survival (DFS), which would not be confounded by
imatinib therapy for patients with disseminated disease
as seen in the evaluation of overall or disease-specific
survival [8, 9]. RTK genotypes were dichotomized into
two different groups based on prognosis, as previously
reported [8, 22]. Briefly, the favorable genotypes included
(i) PDGFRA mutation involving exons 12 or 18, (ii) 3’
tandem insertion of KIT exon 11 with or without point
mutation, and (iii) single point mutation of KIT exon
11. The unfavorable genotypes were (i) Ala502-Tyr503
insertion of KIT exon 9, (ii) wild type for both KIT and
PDGFRA genes, and (iii) 5’ deletion of KIT exon 11 with
or without point mutation. We used the log-rank test to
compare univariate prognostic analyses. Significant
prognosticators with univariate p<0.05 were generally
included in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. As
component factors of the NIH risk scheme [1] and NCCN
guidelines [15], tumor size and mitotic activity were not
introduced in the multivariate comparisons. The difference
in AMACR mRNA abundance in fresh GIST samples of
various risk levels was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test.
Student’s t-test was used to analyze quantitative RT-PCR
and functional assays for cell line samples.
