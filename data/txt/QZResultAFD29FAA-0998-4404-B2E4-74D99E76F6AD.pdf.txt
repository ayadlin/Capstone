ABSTRACT
PEL is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, occurring predominantly as a lymphomatous
effusion in body cavities, characterized by aggressive clinical course, with no standard
therapy. Based on previous reports that PEL cells display a Warburg phenotype, we
hypothesized that the highly hypoxic environment in which they grow in vivo makes
them more reliant on glycolysis, and more vulnerable to drugs targeting this pathway.
We established here that indeed PEL cells in hypoxia are more sensitive to glycolysis
inhibition. Furthermore, since PI3K/Akt/mTOR has been proposed as a drug target in
PEL, we ascertained that pathway-speciﬁc inhibitors, namely the dual PI3K and mTOR
inhibitor, PF-04691502, and the Akt inhibitor, Akti 1/2, display improved cytotoxicity
to PEL cells in hypoxic conditions. Unexpectedly, we found that these drugs reduce
lactate production/extracellular acidiﬁcation rate, and, in combination with the glycolysis
inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), they shift PEL cells metabolism from aerobic glycolysis
towards oxidative respiration. Moreover, the associations possess strong synergistic
cytotoxicity towards PEL cells, and thus may reduce adverse reaction in vivo, while
displaying very low toxicity to normal lymphocytes. Finally, we showed that the
association of 2-DG and PF-04691502 maintains its cytotoxic and proapoptotic effect
also in PEL cells co-cultured with human primary mesothelial cells, a condition known
to mimic the in vivo environment and to exert a protective and pro-survival action.

All together, these results provide a compelling rationale for the clinical development
of new therapies for the treatment of PEL, based on combined targeting of glycolytic
metabolism and constitutively activated signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare
subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL)
whose primary etiological agent is Kaposi’s sarcomaassociated herpesvirus human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV,
or HHV-8), and is often co-infected with Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) [1–5]. This malignancy is characterized
by a very aggressive clinical course, with median
survival times of a few months upon conventional
chemotherapy. Viral gene products have been reported
to dysregulate cellular signaling pathways and to
favor survival. Viral proteins such as K1 and vGPCR
can activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR)
pathway in B-lymphocytes and its constitutive
activation was suggested to play a critical role in PEL
cells growth and survival [6–8]. The efﬁcacy of the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, Sirolimus, in PEL cells in
culture and in a xenograft PEL model, however, was
limited by the rapid emergence of drug resistance [9].
Vertical targeting of the pathway at multiple levels by
the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 gave
more promising results [10]. In addition to its central
role in promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis
[11–15], the alteration of intracellular signaling through
the PI3K/Akt pathway is deemed crucial to achieve
a cancer metabolic phenotype through the Warburg
effect [16–20], i.e. the upregulation of glycolysis that
allows the branching off of glycolytic intermediates
to different anabolic pathways to sustain the higher
demand of the transformed cells for metabolic inputs
to promote proliferation [21–25]. Compared to primary
B-cells, PEL cell lines are characterized by a glycolytic
phenotype [26]; this in turn makes PEL cells sensitive
to the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
under normoxic conditions [26, 27]. It should however
be reminded that, in vivo, PEL develops in an hypoxic
environment [28, 29], the body cavities. In our study
we investigated the efﬁcacy of a panel of glycolysis
inhibitors against PEL cell lines in both normoxic and
hypoxic conditions. On the other hand, because cellular
responses to hypoxia may reduce chemotherapeutic
sensitivity through diverse mechanisms acting on
survival pathways, we addressed the effectiveness of
drugs targeting various levels of the PI3K signaling
cascade. Finally, we determined whether inhibition of
both glycolysis and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated survival
results in a synergistic cooperation to induce more
potent apoptosis and metabolic rerouting.

Glycolysis inhibitors are efﬁcacious against PEL
cell lines
PEL cells were claimed to display a Warburg
phenotype, reﬂected in an elevated glycolytic activity
under normoxic conditions, and inhibition of glycolysis
was reported to be sufﬁcient to reduce cell viability [26].
To deﬁne the metabolic proﬁle of two representative PEL
cell lines, BCBL1 and HBL6, we assessed real-time cellular
respiration using the XF Extracellular Flux Analyser upon
sequential injection of speciﬁc mitochondrial chemical
probes to the culture medium [30]. First, the decrease in
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) following addition of the
complex V inhibitor, oligomycin, was used to calculate ATPlinked respiration and proton leak respiration. Next, carbonyl
cyanide-p-triﬂuoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazon (FCCP), a
protonophore, was added to collapse the inner membrane
gradient, driving the electron proton chain to function to
its maximal rate, and maximal respiratory capacity was
calculated by subtracting non-mitochondrial respiration from
the FCCP OCR. Finally, addition of the complex III inhibitor
antimycin A, together with the complex I inhibitor rotenone,
resulted in the arrest of the electron proton chain function,
allowing quantiﬁcation of non-mitochondrial respiration.
The mitochondrial reserve capacity was then calculated
by subtracting basal respiration from maximal respiratory
capacity (Supplementary Figure S1A). The maximal
respiratory capacity, elicited by exposure to FCCP, appeared
much more pronounced in HBL6 compared to BCBL1
(Figure 1A). Besides, the spare respiratory capacity, an index
of the efﬁciency of the electron transport chain to respond
to energy demand and a predictor of the ability of cells to
resist stressful conditions [31], reported to be reduced by
oncogenic transformation [32, 33], was signiﬁcantly lower
in BCBL1 compared to HBL6 (Figure 1B). This reduced
mitochondrial reserve capacity suggests that BCBL1 cells
are more prone to increase glycolysis in hypoxic condition.
Thus, we next estimated the extracellular acidiﬁcation
rate (ECAR), which correlates with the rate of glycolysis
because of the by-product lactic acid, in BCBL1 cells. We
observed that these cells indeed display a high basal aerobic
glycolysis, assessed by ECAR (Figure 1C), together with
low oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 1D). In the presence
of the well-known hexokinase (HXK) inhibitor 2-DG [34–
36], we observed reduction in extracellular acidiﬁcation,
due to the block of glycolytic ﬂux, as expected (Figure 1C).
Interestingly the ratio between OCR and ECAR in basal

5522

condition was signiﬁcantly increased in presence of 2-DG
compared to glucose only (Figure 1D). This value is an index
of the relative contribution of glycolysis or mitochondrial
activity on cellular metabolism and suggests that, in presence
of 2-DG inhibition, a reversal of the Warburg effect is
occurring [37]. Indeed as ECAR dropped by about 70%,
the relative OCR level progressively increased, suggesting
that mitochondria respiration is fueled through an alternative
carbon source (Figure 1D). To substantiate this observation,
we performed an indirect evaluation of the mitochondrial
ATP production assessing the mitochondrial membrane
potential ﬂuctuations in response to oligomycin. In the
presence of 2-DG, mitochondrial hyperpolarization boosted
up, indicating an augmented production of mitochondrial
ATP, which inversely correlates with the Warburg effect
(Supplementary Figure S1B).

PEL cells grow in body cavities, i.e. in hypoxic
conditions [28, 29]. It was therefore tempting to ask
whether adaptation to such hostile setting makes PEL
cells even more reliant on glycolysis for their energy
requirements, and thus more vulnerable to inhibitors
that target this metabolic pathway. Accordingly, we
analyzed the glycolytic ﬂux of PEL cells cultured in
low oxygen. A boost in the secretion of lactate in the
culturing medium (Figure 1E), paralleled by an increase
in the mRNA expression of glycolytic enzymes pyruvate
kinase PKM1 and PKM2 (Figure 1F), suggested
that growing in low oxygen increases the glycolytic
metabolism of these cells, although this might be due
also to an hypoxia-dependent increase of the lactate
transporter, the monocarboxylate transporter 1 MCT1
[38], whose expression in these cells is indeed low

Figure 1: Hypoxia increases the glycolytic ﬂux in PEL cells. Before the assay, the cells were counted and seeded at 150.000 cell/

well in XF96 culture plates. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was analyzed in real time by the XF96 analyzer in normoxia, under
basal conditions and after sequential addition to the assay medium, through injection ports in the sensor cartridge, of 2 μM oligomycin A,
1 μM FCCP, and 1 μM rotenone + 1 μM antimycin A (ﬁnal concentrations), to determine max respiratory capacity (OCR after injection
of 1 μM FCCP) A. and spare respiratory capacity (OCR after injection of 1 μM FCCP minus basal OCR) B. Acidiﬁcation of the growth
medium (ECAR) of BCBL1 cells was measured in the absence (basal) or presence of 2-DG for 24 hours, as indicated. Addition of 2-DG to
the medium drops ECAR by about 70%, due to HXK inhibition C. while the Relative Oxygen Consumption is shown by the OCR/ECAR
ratio D. The level of lactate in the culture media of BCBL1 and HBL6 cells grown in normoxia or in hypoxia for 24 hours was measured
as described in Methods. Proliferating cells grown in hypoxia divert glucose to lactate, resulting in increased lactate production. The data
are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three different replicates E. Cell pellets from the above experiment were analyzed by RT-PCR for the
expression of the glycolysis rate-limiting enzymes PKM1 and PKM2 F. Where indicated, paired t-Test was performed on each mean value.

(Figure 2G). On these bases, we decided to analyze
the cytotoxic effect of 2-DG on the above cell lines
cultured in normoxia or hypoxia. Cells were incubated
for 24 hours with increasing concentrations of 2-DG,
followed by MTT assay. As expected, cell viability
was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 2-DG
(Figure 2A). Besides, hypoxia largely potentiated
cell sensitivity to 2-DG [39], dropping cell viability
at a lower dose (Figure 2A). Next, we compared
the effect of 2-DG with that of molecules targeting
different steps of glycolysis [40]. These included
3-bromo-pyruvate (3-BrPA) [41, 42], which targets
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
and HXK [43]; oxamate, which inhibits lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) [44, 45], and dichloroacetate
(DCA), which acts instead by reversing the cancer-

associated suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH) through inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase, thereby promoting the mitochondrial oxidation
of pyruvate [46], and lonidamine [42, 47, 48], which
inhibits HXK. To exclude potential alteration of cellular
sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs due to a reduction in
their ability to proliferate, viability of untreated cells
was assessed by MTT after culturing for 24 hours in
oxygen-deprived or normoxic conditions and found
to be not statistically signiﬁcant (average log2 fold
change between the hypoxia and normoxia MTT values
0.074 ± 2.56; 2-tailed paired t-test of hypoxia versus
normoxia values = 0.48). Lonidamine (Figure 2B) and
3-BrPA (Figure 2C) had no effect on cell viability even
at very high concentration, of no clinical signiﬁcance,
and longer incubation times (not shown). Importantly,

transporter MCT-1 was measured by RT-PCR in HBL6, BCBL1 and CEM cell lines.

however, viability was markedly diminished in both
cell lines following treatment with DCA (Figure 2D)
and oxamate (Figure 2E). In the case of oxamate, the
effect was further strengthened by hypoxia, similar
to what observed with 2-DG (Table 1A). Thus, the
ability of 2-DG, oxamate and DCA to cause apoptotic
cell death was explored measuring the proportion of
sub-G1 cells by ﬂow cytometry. Cells cultured either in
hypoxia or in normoxia had comparable basal level of
apoptosis (about 5%). However, upon administration of
equal doses of drugs, cells cultured in hypoxia in the
presence of 2-DG or oxamate displayed more abundant
apoptosis (Figure 2F), whereas, similar to what observed

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in the viability assay, DCA induced the same proportion
of apoptosis in both normoxia and hypoxia (Figure
2F). Besides, we speculated that as both 3-BrPA and
Lonidamine are transported into the cell through MCT1
[49, 50], these cell lines might express low amounts
of the MCT1 protein and would be for this reason
inherently resistant even to high concentration of the
drugs. RT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed that this is indeed the
case, as both HBL6 and BCBL1 cells display very low
levels of MCT1 transcript, compared to that found in
cell lines sensitive to 3-BrPA such as the lymphoblastic
leukemia cell line CEM (Figure 2G). Thus, because of
its better cell permeability and chemical stability, the

ester pro-drug of 3-BrPA, 3-bromo-pyruvate propyl
ester (3-BrOP) was used instead. 3-BrOP showed very
high citotoxicity at low dosage (Figure 2C), suggesting
that the ability of 3-BrOP to enter the cells and release
3-BrPA via hydrolysation by cellular esterases accounts
for the > 10 fold difference in the potency of the two
compounds. However, its efﬁcacy was not improved by
hypoxia (Table 1A).

either in normoxia or in hypoxia were proﬁled by means of
reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) and Western
blotting, with a panel of antibodies recognizing primarily
phosphorylated epitopes of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway (Figure 3A–3C). HeLa cells were used as positive
control, since in these cells the above pathway is known to
be constitutively active [52]. The result not only conﬁrms
that the pathway is constitutively activated in all samples
but also demonstrates that hypoxia negatively affects it
at the level of mTORC1 and its downstream substrate
P70S6K (Figure 3B). These results were conﬁrmed
by Western blotting (Figure 3C and Supplementary
Table S2A). Stabilization and activation of the Hypoxia
Inducible Factor 1 (HIF1) was monitored as a readout of
hypoxia, assessing the expression of the regulatory subunit
HIF1α (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure S2B–S2C).
HIF1 has been demonstrated to be a master regulator

Hypoxia inhibits the mTOR pathway in PEL
cells
Cellular responses to hypoxia are known to reduce
chemotherapeutic sensitivity through various direct or
indirect mechanisms acting on survival pathways [51],
such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. To get
more insights into this issue, PEL cells grown for 24 hours

of the switch in glucose metabolism from oxidative
respiration to aerobic glycolysis [53, 54]. HIF1-mediated
hypoxia response and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
have demonstrated an intimate mutual dependence, and
can act in an integrated way, even though the modality
of the interaction is largely dependent on cell-type and
experimental set-up [55]. Opposite to what reported
previously in different cell models, in PEL cells forced
expression of a constitutively active form of Akt, myrAkt
[56], which inactivates TSC1/2 by direct phosphorylation,
was not sufﬁcient to stabilize HIF1α in normoxia
(Supplementary Figure S2A). On the other hand, mTOR
inhibition by rapamycin, which targets mTORC1, and
by torin1, which blocks both mTORC1 and 2, decreased
hypoxia-induced HIF1α levels (Supplementary Figure
S2B), indicating that the mTOR pathway is necessary
for the full realization of the HIF-mediated response to
hypoxia in these cells.

that while torin1, MK2206 and NVPBEZ235 effectiveness
was barely affected (Supplementary Figure S3A–S3C
and Supplementary Table S1), hypoxia did enhance
cytotoxicity of both the Akti 1/2 and the PF-04691502
inhibitors (Figure 4B–4C), in good agreement with the
signiﬁcantly lower EC50 values displayed by the same two
drugs in hypoxia. The results are summarized in Table 1B
and Supplementary Table S1. Next, to ascertain that the
effects of the inhibitors were not due to off-target action,
the expression of Akt1 and 2 (the Akt isoforms detectable
in these cells) was silenced by a speciﬁc siRNA directed
to a sequence common to Akt 1 and Akt2, and compared
to scramble siRNA. As expected, the downregulation
of Akt expression dramatically decreased cell viability
(Figure 4D).

Hypoxia alters PEL cells sensitivity to inhibitors
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

We next investigated whether modulation of the
pathway by the indicated drugs may be useful to control
PEL cell metabolic rewiring. BCBL1 cells were treated
as described above, then the glucose-to-lactate ﬂux was
calculated, based on the ECAR of the culture media.
Remarkably, all treatments caused a reduction of ECAR,
i.e. of glycolysis, to an extent close to that obtained with
2 mM 2-DG (Figure 5A), with the exception of MK2206
(Supplementary Figure S4A). In agreement with this
ﬁnding, we observed that, although glycolysis in basal
condition is already very high in these cells, an additional
increase of Akt activity through forced expression of its
constitutively active form, led to a small but signiﬁcant
extra boost of ECAR (Figure 5A). Moreover, when cells
were grown in low oxygen, all treatments signiﬁcantly
counteracted the production of lactate (p < 0.05) (Figure
5B). Similar results were obtained by means of silencing
Akt with speciﬁc siRNA (Figure 5C). We concluded
therefore that the effects described above, triggered by
addition of these drugs to BCBL1 cells, are indeed due to
the inhibition of the activity of their target kinases.
This observation conﬁrms the involvement of the
PI3K cascade in the regulation of glucose metabolism
in PEL cells. As a consequence of the reduced glucose
utilization, also OCR appears slightly inhibited in both basal
condition (Figure 5D) as well as upon FCCP-stimulated
maximal respiration (Figure 5E). Notably the OCR/ECAR
ratio remains mostly unchanged, suggesting that inhibition
of the PI3K cascade alone does not revert the Warburg effect
characterizing this cell line (Figure 5F). Quite unexpectedly,
however, we found that in combination with 2-DG these
compounds increased both basal and max respiration rate
(Figure 5D–5E). Accordingly, 2-DG combined with PF04691502 or with Akti 1/2 resulted in a signiﬁcant (p < 0.05)
boost of the OCR/ECAR ratio (Figure 5F). In particular, the
combination of 2-DG with PF-04691502 as well as with
Akti 1/2 was characterized by high oxygen consumption,

Disruption of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
PEL cells affects glucose metabolism

PI3K/Akt/mTOR is a converging hub of both
oncogenic and metabolic signaling [57–59]. Recently it
has been shown to strongly affect cellular metabolism,
favoring and supporting the Warburg phenotype in cancer
cells both directly and indirectly: as a target of multiple
growth factors, PI3K stimulation can lead to chronic
activation of Akt in cancer cells, which in turn can directly
increase the expression of glucose transporters and
glycolytic enzymes [60–65]. Besides, PI3K can inﬂuence
cell metabolism indirectly through the stimulation of
mTORC1, that in turn controls amino acid metabolism
and protein translation [66]. Importantly, the dual PI3K
and mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235 was previously
shown to counteract the glycolytic phenotype of the
BCBL1 PEL cell line and to delay tumor progression in a
xenograft model of PEL [10]. The high activation of Akt,
moreover, has been recently shown to drive glycolysis
of leukemic cells [67]. Therefore, we investigated the
effect of a panel of drugs targeting either Akt, namely
the allosteric inhibitors Akti 1/2 and MK2206, or mTOR,
namely torin1, or both PI3K and mTOR, namely the
abovementioned NVPBEZ235 and the second generation
dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor PF-04691502, on the
glycolytic BCBL1 cell line. All the above drugs inhibited
their target efﬁciently, as demonstrated by the decreased
phosphorylation of Akt S473 and P70S6K T389 (Figure
4A and Supplementary Table S2B–S2C), indicating that in
PEL cells this pathway is indeed druggable. Furthermore,
we assessed that they were all cytotoxic on PEL cells, with
an EC50 in the nanomolar or low micromolar range. In
particular, given the perturbation of the pathway during
hypoxia, which might potentially alter cellular sensitivity
to the drugs, we compared the cytotoxic activity of the
compounds in normoxia and in hypoxia. It is worth noting

and resulted in a signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) shift from aerobic
glycolysis towards a more oxidative respiration (Figure 5E).
We asked whether such a shift might render cancer cells
more susceptible to induction of apoptosis. Therefore we
next tested the cytotoxicity of these drug combinations on
PEL cells by MTT assay. The association with 2-DG clearly
drops cell viability (Figure 6A–6E), with a concentrationdependent effect, as indicated by the combination index (CI)
values (Table 1C), calculated according to Chou&Talalay
[68]. The results point to a strong synergism (CI < 0.5) of
2-DG in association with Akti 1/2 or with PF-04691502,
both in normoxia and in hypoxia (Table 1C). In particular,
hypoxia further diminishes cell viability by these
combinations, which thus might prove useful as a novel

therapeutic approach for PEL. However, because these
results were obtained by means of a metabolic assay based
on mitochondrial activity, which might be affected by the
drugs, apoptosis triggered by single or combined treatments
was assessed by Annexin V staining. The result demonstrates
that 2-DG indeed potentiates the effect of both Akti 1/2 and,
to a greater extent, PF-04691502. Importantly, it also shows
that a low oxygen environment further augments the number
of Annexin V positive cells (Figure 6E), strengthening the
concept that this type of drug association should be taken
into account as a novel approach in PEL therapy.
Due to the recently demonstrated shielding effect of
the mesothelium on lymphoma progression [69], we then
asked whether the mesothelial microenvironment protects

against 2-DG+PF-04691502-facilitated apoptosis. To
mimic the physiological microenvironment, BCBL1 cells
were co-cultured with primary human mesothelial cells
(HMC) for 48 hours, a condition sufﬁcient to highlight
the pro-survival effect of HMC on BCBL1 cells (Figure
6F). Then cells cultures were subjected to treatment with
DMSO vehicle (mock) or with a combination of 2-DG and

PF-04691502 for 24 or 48 hours. Total apoptosis of the
BCBL1 population was determined by means of Annexin
V staining. While HMC co-culture proved able to protect
PEL cells from apoptosis in basal condition, it is clear
that it is not sufﬁcient to abrogate the pro-apoptotic effect
of the drugs nor to diminish its efﬁcacy (Figure 6F and
Supplementary Figure S5A–S5B).

DISCUSSION

Finally to investigate the toxicity of the proposed
drug combinations on normal cells, BCBL1 cells were
grown for 24 hours in the presence of 2-DG ± PF04691502 or Akti 1/2, and the viability, assessed by
Annexin V/PI staining, was compared to that of normal
human B (CD19+) and T (CD3+) lymphocytes from
healthy donors. It is very interesting to note that in both
cases drugs appear to exert little toxicity on normal human
lymphocytes, compared to PEL cells (Figure 7B–7D),
suggesting some degree of speciﬁcity towards PEL cells.

Remodeling of energy metabolism from oxidative
phosphorylation to oxygen-independent aerobic glycolysis
is becoming a sensible area for drug targeting. PEL is a
B-cell NHL characterized by a very poor prognosis, with
a median survival of six months after the diagnosis and
no standard therapy [1–4]. In agreement with a previous
report [26], we detail here that PEL cells preferentially
channel glucose towards lactate production even in

Figure 6: Hypoxia strenghtens the cytotoxicity of the drug treatment. BCBL-1 cells were grown in normoxia or in hypoxia,

to D show the MTT response relative to controls. CI was calculated with the CalcuSyn algorithm. E. From the same experimental setting,
total apoptosis of cells treated with 2 mM 2-DG with or without 625 nM PF-04691502 or 1 μM Akti1/2 was assessed by Annexin V staining.
F. BCBL1 cells were co-cultured for 24 or 48 hours with HMC in a medium additioned with vehicle (mock), with 625 nM PF-04691502
or with 1 μM Akti1/2. Total apoptosis was calculated as the mean percentage of Annexin V positive BCBL1 cells in each condition, as
indicated.

the presence of oxygen, and thus display a glycolytic
metabolism. A large body of evidence has shown that
the glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells is due to active
glycolysis prevailing over mitochondrial respiration
rather than to defects in mitochondrial function [70].
The observation that proliferation and tumorigenicity
of cancer cells can be inhibited blocking glycolysis,
however, suggests that enhanced oxidative respiration is
not sufﬁcient to meet the requirement of cancer growth
and that glycolysis is a target of cancer therapy [71–73].
In our work, we conﬁrm that BCBL1 cells maintain the
ability to produce ATP by mitochondrial respiration, and
that inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG is toxic to these cells.
We also demonstrate that 2-DG as well as other glycolysis
inhibitors such as oxamate are particularly effective
against PEL in low-oxygen settings, a condition that
mimics the highly hypoxic environment of body cavities
[28–29]. This indicates that in hypoxia PEL cells are even
more reliant on glycolysis for their energy requirements
and thus intrinsically more exposed to its inhibition.
Although its potential as monotherapy is poor, in spite of
the promising results in vitro and in animal models as well
as of its excellent safety proﬁle as anti-cancer drug, 2-DG
has been shown to enhance the efﬁcacy of many drugs
when administered in combination [74, 75].

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling can favor and
support the Warburg phenotype in cancer cells both
directly and indirectly. PI3K stimulation by multiple
growth factors can lead to chronic activation of Akt in
cancer cells, which directly increases the expression
of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, and in
turn glucose metabolism in cancer cells versus normal
cells [61, 62]. In particular, Akt has been shown to
regulate HXK expression, activity, and mitochondrial
interaction [76], as well as the localization of the glucose
transporter GLUT1 to the plasma membrane [60]. In
addition, phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase-2
by Akt [77] drives allosteric activation of PFK1. Akt
activity correlates to the degree of a high level of aerobic
glycolysis without increasing oxygen consumption
[62], and has been recently shown to drive glycolysis of
leukemic cells [67]. In previous studies, the efﬁcacy of
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in PEL cells in culture
and in a xenograft PEL model was limited by the rapid
emergence of drug resistance [9], whereas dual targeting
of PI3K and mTOR by the inhibitor NVP-BEZ235
gave better results [10]. In this study the animal PEL
model was obtained by subcutaneous injection of PEL
cells, though, rather than by peritoneal engraftment,
which would reproduce the in vivo pathology more

MATERIALS AND METHODS

closely. Taking the view that alteration of intracellular
signaling through the PI3K pathway is deemed crucial
to achieve a cancer metabolic phenotype through the
Warburg effect, our study highlights the previously
unreported observation that pathway-speciﬁc inhibitors
targeting either PI3K/mTOR or Akt counteract lactate
production to an extent similar to that obtained by 2-DG,
as indicated by the shift of the ECAR. Remarkably, in
these cells PF-04691502 is able not only to signiﬁcantly
decrease the extracellular acidiﬁcation but also to
deeply enhance the mitochondrial respiration rates, thus
switching aerobic glycolysis towards a more oxidative
metabolism. As expected, all drugs dramatically
decrease cell viability. Most importantly, both effects are
enhanced by association with 2-DG, pointing to a strong
synergistic action, both in normoxia and in hypoxia.
Although the rationale of this synergy is not completely
understood, it is worth remembering that 2-DG also
increases oxidative stress, affects protein glycosylation,
and therefore causes aberrant GlcNAcylation of
proteins and accumulation of misfolded proteins in
the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to autophagy and
ER stress response [78, 79]. This last effect may be
particularly relevant to our work, as it has been recently
demonstrated that Akt inhibition potentiates toxicity
induced by 2-DG through ER stress response in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia by enhancing the unfolded
protein response. [80]. Moreover, it has been shown
recently that 2DG can also modify the expression
proﬁle of cancer cells [81]. In particular, it was claimed
to induce the transient expression of p21 and a stable
expression of p53, together with cell cycle arrest at
G0/G1 phase and apoptosis through the intrinsic,
mitochondrial pathway in colorectal cancer cells [81].
Interestingly these effects were totally independent of
its inhibitory effect on either hexokinase or ATP levels.
All together these studies provide key insights about
processes, essential for the biological properties of
2-DG, that act beyond the metabolic block, and might
prompt cancer cells to the pro-apoptotic action of the
drugs used in our study.
Moreover, it is particularly important that the proapoptotic function of this drug association also prevails
over the shielding action of the HMC in the HMC-BCBL1
co-culture performed to mimic the PEL microenvironment
[69]. Finally, it is worth remembering that we have shown
here that the above drug associations exert very low
toxicity in normal human B and T lymphocytes, compared
to PEL cells, suggesting some degree of speciﬁcity
towards cancer cells. Thus, all together, our results open
a new therapeutic approach for PEL. Notably, because
the above combinations are highly effective also under
normoxic conditions, they could be extended to other
B-NHL characterized by a glycolytic phenotype.

Chemicals and reagents
Akti 1/2 was purchased from Calbiochem,
rapamycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), dichloroacetate
(DCA) and 3-bromo pyruvate (3-BrPA), were from
Sigma-Aldrich, PF-04691502, torin1 and MK2206 were
from Selleckchem, lonidamine from LTK Laboratories and
NVPBEZ235 were from Axon Medchem. A derivative of
3-BrPA, 3-bromo-2-oxopropionate-1-propyl ester (3BrOP), was synthesized by esteriﬁcation of 3-BrPA with
1-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described [82].
siRNA to Akt1 and 2 were from Origine (Rockville, MD,
USA).

Cell culture and transfection
PEL cell lines BCBL1 and HBL6 were maintained
in RPMI1640 supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml
12 streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine. Both cell lines are
KSHV-positive; HBL6 are also EBV-positive. Cells
were grown under either normoxia (21% O2, 5% CO2) or
hypoxia (1% O2, 5% CO2) at 37°C for the indicated times
and drug concentrations. Low O2 tension was obtained
using either a Hypoxia Chamber (StemCell Technologies)
or the INVIVO200 hypoxia workstation (Ruskinn
Technology Ltd., UK). Transfection of BCBL1 cells was
performed using the Amaxa nucleofection system (Amaxa,
Cologne, Germany). Brieﬂy, 5–10 × 106 cells were
resuspended in nucleofector solution V prior to addition of
DNA (CMV6-HA-myrAkt, CMV6 empty vector, siRNA
to Akt 1 and 2 or scramble siRNA), then transferred to
an Amaxa-certiﬁed cuvette and transfected using program
T-001. Cells were examined for the expression of
transfected genes 24 to 48 hours post transfection.

Western blotting and RPPA analysis
Samples were extracted in TPER reagent (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). For Western blotting, 30 μg of total
lysates were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore) as previously described [83]. Array
assembly, printing, staining and analysis were performed
as described [84–86]. Antibodies against phosphorylated
epitopes were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Antiβ-actin was from Sigma Aldrich. Anti-HIF1α was from
BD Biosciences. Differences in basal phosphorylation of
treated samples were compared by calculating the ratio
of each sample’s SI (signal intensity) divided by vehicle(DMSO) or drug-treated sample’s SI. To determine the
signiﬁcance of the difference in mean of treated samples
we used a Paired student’s t test with a P-values = 0.05.

MTT assay

RT-PCR

Viability of PEL cells treated with various
inhibitors or the appropriate vehicle as a negative
control was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)- based
colorimetric assay as previously described [87]. Where
indicated, effective dose 50s and combination index
were calculated following the Chou-Talalay method [68]
and the softwares GrafIt and CompuSyn (ComboSyn
InC.)

Total RNA extraction was as described [83], using the
Aurum Total RNA Fatty and Fibrous Tissue kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Genomic DNA was removed by DNase treatment.
MCT-1 and isoform-speciﬁc PKM1 (NM_182470) and
PKM2 (NM_002654) forward and reverse primers were
as follows: 5-TTTCTTTGCGGCTTCCGTTGTTG-3;
antisense,
5-TCAATTTACCCTTCAGCCCCATGG
for MCT-1; 5′- CTGAGGCAGCCATGTTCC- 3′ and
5′- CCATGAGGTCTGTGGAGTG- 3′ for PKM1;
5′- ACTTGGTGAGGACGATTATG- 3′ and 5′CTGCCATCTACCACTTGC- 3′ for PKM2. PCR primers
were designed using Beacon Designer 2.06 (Premier Biosoft
International). Real-time ampliﬁcations, using SYBR Green
detection chemistry, were run in triplicate on 96-well
reaction plates with the CFX96 machine (Bio-Rad).

Lactate assay
Cells were rinsed in fresh media and grown for
6 or 24 hours in the presence or absence of inhibitors
as indicated. Media samples were then collected, ﬂashfrozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at –80°C
until the time of the assay. Lactate levels in media were
measured using a Lactate Assay Kit (Eton Bioscience Inc.)
according to manufacturer instructions.

XF bioenergetic analysis
Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidiﬁcation
rates in PEL cells were measured using the Seahorse
XF96 instrument (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica,
MA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 24 hours
after treatment, cells were seeded in a poly-lysine coated
XF96 microplate at the density of 150000 cells per well,
for 60 minutes in a 37°C non-CO2 incubator, while
sensor cartridges were calibrated prior to the start of an
assay. After adhesion, medium was changed with 175
μl unbuffered XF assay media at pH 7.4 supplemented
with 5.5 mM glucose (Sigma), 1 mM sodium pyruvate
and 1 mM Glutamine. Respiration was measured in four
blocks of three for 3 min. The ﬁrst block measured the
basal respiration rate. Next 2 μM oligomycin was added to
inhibit complex V (second block). Then 0.3 μM carbonyl
cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP,
Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA) was added to
uncouple respiration (third block). Finally, 1 μM antimycin
A and 1 μM Rotenone was added to inhibit complex III
(forth block). All reagents are from Seahorse Biosciences,
North Billerica, MA. Immediately after ﬁnishing the
measurements, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline, ﬁxed with 4% paraphormaldehyde and stained with
0.1% crystal violet (1 mol/l acetic acid) and absorbance at
595 nm was measured as index of cell amount.

Flow cytometry analysis
For cell cycle analysis, 5 × 105 cells were centrifuged
at 1200 rpm for 8 minutes, washed with PBS and ﬁxed with
cold 70% EtOH for 2 hours, and incubated with 25 μg (1
μl) of RNAse (Sigma Aldrich, 25 μg/μl) for 1 hour at 37°C.
PI (25 μl, 5 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) was added fresh prior
to analysis. For detection of apoptosis, 1 × 106 cells were
washed twice with PBS and stained with Annexin V–FITC
and PI in 1X binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140
mM NaOH, 2.5 mM CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature
in the dark. Both early apoptotic (Annexin V+, PI-) and late
(Annexin V+ and PI+) apoptotic cells were included in cell
death determinations. Annexin V- and PI-negative cells are
viable cells. The analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur
(BD Bioscences, NJ, USA).

BCBL1-mesothelial cells co-culture
Primary human mesothelial cells (HMC) were
isolated and cultured as previously reported [69]. To
evaluate the activity of 2-DG and PF on BCBL1 cells in
a context mimicking the intracavitary environment, 2 ×
105 BCBL1 cells were co-cultured with subconﬂuent cells
ﬁrst passage HMC in 6-well plates with or without drug
treatment for 48 hours. Total apoptosis of BCBL1 cells
was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry after Annexin V staining
(Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit, Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). Data were analyzed using the
Kaluza Flow Analysis software (Beckman Coulter). SD
of the ratio is calculated according to the theory of error
propagation, as previously reported [88].

Measurement of cellular ATP content
Intracellular ATP was measured by bioluminescence
using a luciferin-luciferase system (ATP bioluminescent
assay kit CLS II; Roche) as described previously [89].
The amount of ATP measured was referred to the protein
content, determined by the method of Lowry [90], and
expressed as nmol/mg protein.
