Abstract
Anti–4-1BB and cisplatin showed synergistic anticancer effects
in the CT-26 colon carcinoma model, producing complete
regression in >60% of mice with either preventive or
therapeutic treatment. The tumor-free mice formed longlasting CD8+ T cell–dependent tumor-specific memory. Anti–
4-1BB induced rapid repopulation of T and B cells from
cisplatin-mediated lymphopenia and differentiation and
expansion of IFN-;+CD11c+CD8+ T cells. Cisplatin facilitated
expansion of naı̈ve, effector, and memory CD8+ T cells;
combination therapy produced almost twice as many lymphoid cells as anti–4-1BB alone. Cisplatin increased 4-1BB on
antigen-primed T cells and induced 4-1BB de novo on kidney
tubular epithelium. Cross-linking of 4-1BB protected the
T cells and kidney epithelium from cisplatin-mediated
apoptosis by increasing expression of antiapoptotic molecules.
Thus, cisplatin-induced 4-1BB provided a mechanism for
amelioration of the lymphopenia and nephrotoxicity inherent
in cisplatin treatment. We concluded that chemoimmunotherapy with anti–4-1BB and cisplatin is synergistic in tumor
killing and prevention of organ-specific toxicity. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Immunotherapy can complement anticancer chemotherapy
(1–6). Agonistic anti–4-1BB (CD137), an immunotherapeutics,
displays a strong anticancer effect (7–9) and is undergoing clinical
trials against various tumors. Genotoxic agents, g-irradiation,
and chemotherapeutics increased 4-1BB expression on T cells, and
cross-linking of the 4-1BB enhanced T-cell survival (10). We,
therefore, hypothesized that the chemotherapeutics that enhanced
4-1BB expression could potentiate the anticancer activities of an
agonistic anti–4-1BB.
Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat a
variety of tumors (11). The efficacy of cisplatin is dose dependent,
although it induces thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia (12).
Nephrotoxicity frequently hinders the use of higher doses that
would maximize its antineoplastic effects (13, 14).

Here, we investigated whether anti–4-1BB augmented the
anticancer effect of cisplatin and ameliorated cisplatin-induced
loss of leukocytes and renal dysfunction. The results revealed that
combination therapy with agonistic anti–4-1BB and cisplatin
enhanced primary and memory antitumor immune responses,
which were mediated by a preferential enhancement of antigenspecific CD8+ T cells, especially CD11c+CD8+ T cells. Moreover,
anti–4-1BB treatment attenuated cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity
by protecting renal tubular epithelial cells from cisplatin-induced
apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c, C57BL/6, and OT-1 mice (Jackson
Laboratory), and Rag2gc / (CIEA) were housed in a specific pathogen-free
facility at the Immunomodulation Research Center (IRC) at the University
of Ulsan. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
approved protocols and guidelines of the IRC’s Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Antibodies and peptides. Anti–m4-1BB hybridoma cells (3E1) were a
gift from Dr. Robert Mittler (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Anti-mCD4
(GK1.5) and anti-mCD8 (2.43) hybridomas were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection. Purified rat IgG was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Flow cytometric monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were purchased from
BD PharMingen. H-2Kb/OVA257-264- phycoerythrin (PE) pentamers were
purchased from ProImmune Ltd. OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL) was synthesized
by Peptron.
Tumor challenge and treatment. Mice were injected s.c. with 3  105
CT26 cells on the dorsal surface [posttumor injection (PI) day 0]. As a
standard treatment, tumor-challenged mice were injected i.p. with 100 Ag of
rat IgG or anti–4-1BB mAb (3E1) every 5 d for 5 times, and a single injection
of 10 mg/kg cisplatin on PI day 0. To examine therapeutic effects of
combined therapy, the mice received the standard therapy beginning 6 d PI.
For tumor rechallenge, tumor-free mice were injected s.c. in the opposite
flank 100 d after the primary tumor inoculation with CT26 or RENCA cells
(3, 6, or 12  105 cells per mouse). Mice were injected i.p. with 400 Ag of
anti-CD4 or anti-CD8, or 100 Ag of anti–asialo-GM1 antibody every 5 d for
5 cycles. The efficacy of immune subset depletion (>99%) was confirmed
by flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry. Lymphocytes were incubated with the Fc blocker 2.4G2
for 10 min at 4jC and stained with specific antibodies to surface markers.
To identify IFN-g–producing cells, tumor-draining lymph node (TDLN) cells
were first stimulated with 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and
500 ng/mL ionomycin for 6 h in a medium containing Brefeldin A. Cells
were then stained with FITC-anti-CD8 or anti-CD4, and intracellularly
stained PE-anti–IFN-g by using Cytofix/cytoperm kit. All samples were
analyzed using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences).
Assessment of renal function. Blood samples were obtained from
before (0 h) and at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment with cisplatin and/or
anti–4-1BB mAb. Serum creatinine was measured as a marker of renal
dysfunction using a Roche Cobas Rara automated system (Roche) with a
Creatinine kit (R&D Systems).

Histologic examination. The kidney paraffin block was cut into 4-Am
sections and stained with H&E. Renal tubular damage was assessed using
a semiquantitative scale. A pathologist who was blinded to the experiments
scored the degree of tubular damage. The magnitude of tubular epithelial
cell loss and necrosis was scored on the basis of the percentage of affected
tubules in a high-power field under a light microscope, as follows: 0, normal;
0.5, <10%; 1, 10% to 25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; and 4, >75%. For anti–
4-1BB immunostaining of the kidney, thin cryosections from kidneys were
stained with FITC-anti–m4-1BB (3E1) mAb, and visualized with an Olympus
FV500 confocal laser scanning microscope.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells
and tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA using a SuperScriptII (Invitrogen Life Technologies).
Gene-specific primers used were as follows: mouse 4-1BB, forward
5¶-tgacatttcgccatgggaaacaactgt-3¶, reverse 5¶-tcccggtcttaagcacagaccttccgt-3¶;
human 4-1BB, forward 5¶-cgcgtggatccacaagatcattgcaggatcc-3¶, reverse
5¶-ttgagctcgaggatctgcggagagtgtcctg-3¶; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forward 5¶-gaacgggaagcttgtcatcaa-3¶, reverse 5¶-ctaagcagttggtggtgcag-3¶. PCR conditions were as follows: for 4-1BB, 94jC for

5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94jC, 30 s at 55jC, and 1 min at
72jC with a final extension at 72jC for 5 min; for the GAPDH reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), conditions were identical except that 30 cycles
were used instead of 35.
Real-time PCR. SYBR Green I–based real-time quantitative PCR was
carried out on a continuous fluorescence detection system (Opticon DNA
Engine; MJ Research, Inc.) with first-strand cDNA of kidney. Gene-specific
primers used were as follows: mouse Bcl-2, forward 5¶-tgggatgcctttgtggaactat-3¶, reverse 5¶-agagacagccaggagaaatcaaac-3¶; mouse Bcl-XL, forward
5¶-ctgggacacttttgtggatctct-3¶, reverse 5¶-gaagcgctcctggccttt-3¶; mouse Bfl-1,
forward 5¶-gcagattgccctggatgtat-3¶, reverse 5¶-agaaaagtcagccagccacta-3¶;
mouse Bax, forward 5¶-gagatgaactggacagcaat-3¶, reverse 5¶-atcccaggaaaatgtcataa-3¶; GAPDH, forward 5¶-gaacgggaagcttgtcatcaa-3¶, reverse 5¶-ctaagcagttggtggtgcag-3¶. The relative gene expression was determined using the
comparative computed tomography (CT) method and normalized to the
housekeeping gene GAPDH. To simplify the representation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL,
Bfl-1, and Bax expression, the gene expression data normalized for GAPDH
are shown as fold increases compared with levels in the rat IgG group and
are means F SD of triplicate experiments.

A, BALB/c mice were challenged s.c. with
3  105 CT26 colon carcinoma cells,
received a single i.p. injection of 200 Ag
cisplatin, and injected i.p. with 100 Ag of
rat IgG or anti–4-1BB mAb (3E1) every 5 d
for 5 times from PI day 0. B, 6 d after tumor
challenge, mice were treated i.p with PBS or
200 Ag cisplatin and injected with rat IgG or
anti–4-1BB mAb every 5 d for 5 times.
The mice were monitored everyday for
tumor growth and survival. C,
tumor-free mice from the anti–4-1BB–
or combination-treated groups were
rechallenged s.c. with the indicated number
of CT26 or RENCA cells on PI day 100
and monitored for tumor growth. In a
separate experiment, tumor-free mice
on PI day 100 were challenged s.c. with
CT26 and treated i.p. with 100 Ag of
anti–asialo-GM1, 400 Ag of GK1.5, or
400 Ag of 2.43 mAb to deplete NK, CD4+
T, or CD8+ T cells every 5 d for
5 times. D, on PI day 17, single-cell
suspensions of TDLNs were stained with
PE-anti–CD11c and PE-Cy5-anti-CD8.
TDLN cells were also stained with
FITC-anti-CD4 or -anti-CD8, and further
intracellularly stained with PE-anti–IFN-g,
and subsequently analyzed using FACscan
(BD Biosciences). Absolute numbers were
calculated by multiplying percentages
measured by flow cytometry by total
numbers of viable cells. Each group
contained 10 mice (A–B ) or 5 mice (C–D ).
The results are representative of two
independent experiments. Points, mean;

rescues lymphocytes from cisplatin-mediated
apoptosis. Tumor-challenged BALB/c mice
were injected i.p. with rat IgG or anti–4-1BB
mAb as well as a single injection of cisplatin
on PI day 0 as described above. On PI
day 17, single-cell suspensions of TDLNs
were stained with FITC-anti-CD62L,
PE-anti-CD44, and PE-Cy5-anti-CD8 (A).
B, 5 d after the treatment, TDLN cells were
counted and stained with FITC-anti-CD3,
FITC-anti-B220, FITC-anti-CD4, or
FITC-anti-CD8, and further stained with
PE-anti–Annexin-V to examine the apoptotic
cells. Samples were subsequently analyzed
using FACscan, and absolute numbers of
Annexin V–negative cells were calculated as
described above. C, to create a system that
determines the 4-1BB expression on both
Ag-specific and Ag-nonspecific CD8+ T cells
simultaneously, OVA-specific CD8+ T cells
were isolated from OT-I mice and adoptively
transferred into C57BL/6 mice (5  106 cells
per mouse). The mice were immunized s.c.
with 10 Ag of OVA in incomplete Freund’s
adjuvant, and injected i.p. with 200 Ag
of cisplatin (filled symbol ) or PBS
(open symbol ) as a control. Draining
lymph node cells were stained with
FITC-anti–4-1BB, PE-Kb/OVA tetramer,
and PE-Cy5-anti-CD8 on the indicated
days. Data dictated the percentage of
4-1BB+CD8+ T cells in gated Kb/OVA
tetramer–negative or Kb/OVA tetramer–
positive CD8+ T cells. D, total RNA was
extracted from CD8+ T cells of 4 different
groups of mice on PI day 5, and first-strand
cDNA was synthesized with 0.5 Ag total
RNA. SYBR Green I–based real-time
quantitative PCR was carried out on a
continuous fluorescence detection system
(Opticon DNA Engine; MJ Research, Inc.).
Relative gene expression was determined
using the comparative CT method and
normalized to the housekeeping gene
GAPDH . To simply represent Bcl-2, Bcl-XL,
Bfl-1, and Bax expression, the gene
expression data normalized for GAPDH are
shown as the fold increase compared with
levels in the rat IgG-treated group. Each
group contained three mice and the results
are representative of two independent
experiments. Columns, mean; bars, SD
(A, B , and D ). Points, means; bars, SD
(C ; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).

Kidney epithelial cells. Kidneys were removed, sliced, and digested
with collagenase type IV in HBSS for 30 min at 37jC. The digest was
centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in a cold culture medium
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was plated onto tissue
culture dishes. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h. Unbound cells were
removed by washing thrice with PBS. Only adherent cells were maintained
as primary cultures at 37jC for 7 d; these cells were then used for
experiments.
Western blot. Samples of 20-Ag kidney protein were diluted with 4 SDS
sample buffer, applied to SDS-PAGE gels, fractionated, and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with
anti–4-1BB mAb (3E1) and anti-rat IgG–horseradish peroxidase, and bound
Ab was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech).
Small interfering RNA transfection and treatment. The cultured
kidney epithelial cells from Rag2gc- or 4-1BB–deficient mice were
transfected with either gene-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) against
Bcl-XL, Bfl-1, and Bax or nontargeting control siRNA according to the
manufacturer’s directions (Santa Cruz Biotechology). Transfection efficiencies were assessed by RT-PCR analysis 36 h after gene transfer. Two days

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

after the transfection, cells were treated with 2 Ag/mL cisplatin and/or
10 Ag/mL rat IgG or anti–4-1BB. The absolute numbers of viable cells were
measured in primary cultures of mouse kidney epithelial cells at the
indicated time points.
Statistics. Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA were performed using
the Prism software program (GraphPad Software).

Results and Discussion
We screened a variety of anticancer chemotherapeutics to select
one that enhanced anticancer activity of the agonistic anti–4-1BB.
A synergistic anticancer effect was observed when cisplatin was
used in combination with anti–4-1BB in B16 melanoma and CT26
carcinoma models. Mice receiving combination therapy seldom
showed the hunched posture, ruffled fur, and diarrhea often seen
with cisplatin alone.
We examined mechanisms involved in this anticancer synergy
and reduced nephrotoxicity in the CT26 model. Mice were treated
with anti–4-1BB and/or cisplatin beginning on PI day 0 or 6: >50%

of 4-1BB–treated mice showed delayed tumor growth and 10% to
30% were tumor free, whereas rat IgG- or cisplatin-alone–treated
mice were dead or sacrificed by PI day 35 due to the large tumor
burden (Fig. 1A and B). Anti–4-1BB plus cisplatin resulted in 60%
to 70% tumor-free mice in both preventive and therapeutic models.
Mice tumor free for >100 days after combination treatment were
rechallenged with CT26 or RENCA cells. CT26 did not grow,
whereas RENCA did (Fig. 1C). Depletion of CD8+ T cells from the
tumor-free mice followed by rechallenge with CT26 produced
tumor growth; depletion of CD4 or natural killer (NK) cells did not
(Fig. 1C). These results suggest that cisplatin enhances 4-1BB–
mediated anticancer effects and that combination therapy leads to
CD8+ T cell–mediated long lasting memory. Anti–4-1BB increased
the numbers of IFN-g+CD4+ and CD8+ T cells including AH-1–
specific CD8+ T cells, and cisplatin provided further enhancement
(Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S1). CD11c+CD8+ T cells (9) were
the major source of IFN-g–producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1D;
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Combination therapy showed enhanced expansion of all three
phenotypes of CD8+ (Fig. 2A) and CD4+ T cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3)—naı̈ve (CD62LhighCD44low), effector (CD62LlowCD44high),

and memory (CD62LlowCD44high)—compared with other monotherapies. Anti–4-1BB alone expanded effector and memory CD8+
T cells significantly compared with IgG or cisplatin alone. 4-1BB
effectively expanded T cells after cisplatin-induced lymphopenia
and expansion after combination therapy was more vigorous than
with 4-1BB alone (Fig. 2A). Reduction of Foxp3+ Treg cells in TDLN
and spleen was observed at 2 to 7 days after cisplatin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4). This may contribute to the cisplatinmediated anticancer effect.
Absolute numbers of viable cells in the TDLNs on PI day 5
showed that cisplatin reduced total lymphoid cells by >78%, T cells
by >70%, and B cells by >90% (Fig. 2B). Combination therapy
enhanced lymphoid cells by PI day 5 compared with cisplatin
alone: total numbers of TDLN cells increased >11-fold, T cells by
>7-fold (CD4, >5-fold; CD8, >11-fold), and B cells by >54-fold.
Combination therapy was also more effective in repopulating
lymphoid cells than anti–4-1BB alone (total cells, 1.7-fold; B cells,
2.5-fold; Fig. 2B). Analysis of TDLN cells on PI day 17 showed a
4-fold increase in CD8+ T cells and a 2-fold increase in CD4+ T cells
with combination therapy, compared with rat IgG treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

cut into 4-mm sections, and stained with H&E. Renal tubular damage was assessed using a semiquantitative scale. A pathologist who was blinded to the experiments
scored the degree of tubular damage. The magnitude of tubular epithelial cell necrosis and loss was scored on the basis of the percentage of affected tubules in a
high-power field under a light microscope, as follows: 0, normal; 0.5, <10%; 1, 10% to 25%; 2, 25% to 50%; 3, 50% to 75%; and 4, >75%. B, blood samples were
obtained from before (0 h) and at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment with cisplatin and/or anti–4-1BB mAb. Serum creatinine was measured as a marker of renal
dysfunction using a Roche Cobas Rara automated system (Roche) with a Creatinine kit (R&D Systems). C, 4-1BB expression in renal tubular epithelial cells.
I, Rag2gc- or 4-1BB–deficient mice received a single injection of 100, 200, or 400 Ag cisplatin. RT-PCR for 4-1BB was performed with cDNA of kidney cells 24 h after
cisplatin administration. II, 4-1BB proteins were detected in kidney samples by performing Western blotting with anti–4-1BB mAb (3E1 clone). D, for anti–4-1BB
immunostaining of the kidney, frozen sections (4-Am thickness) were prepared from kidney 24 h after cisplatin administration and stained with FITC-conjugated
anti–m4-1BB mAb. Sections were viewed and photographed using a laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscope system (Fluoview FV500 Olympus; original
magnification, 10). Each group contained three mice and the results are representative of three independent experiments. Columns, mean; bars, SD (A). Points,

Figure 4. 4-1BB triggering enhances survival of kidney
epithelium in vivo. A, kidney epithelial cells from 4-1BB KO
BALB/c or Rag2gc KO mice were cultured in vitro for 7 d
and treated with 2 Ag/mL cisplatin or PBS for 24 h. RT-PCR
was performed with cDNA of the cultured cells to determine
4-1BB transcripts. B, Rag2gc KO mice were injected i.p.
with indicated doses of cisplatin and also single-injected
with 100 Ag of rat IgG or anti–4-1BB mAb. Complementary
DNA was synthesized with total RNA from kidney 72 h after
cisplatin injection. Real-time PCR (I ) and RT-PCR (II ) were
performed to assess Bcl-2, Bfl-1, and Bax expression as
describe above. Relative gene expression was normalized
to GAPDH and shown as the fold increase compared with
that of rat IgG-treated group. C and D, kidney epithelial
cells from Rag2gc DKO or 4-1BB KO mice were
transfected with either gene-specific siRNA against Bfl-1,
Bax, or nontargeting control siRNA (con siRNA ) according
to manufacturer’s instruction (Santa Cruz Biotechology).
C, decrease in Bfl-1 or Bax mRNA upon corresponding
siRNA transfection was determined by RT-PCR. D, cells
were treated with 2 Ag/mL cisplatin and/or 10 Ag/mL of rat
IgG or anti–4-1BB, and the absolute numbers of viable cells
were determined at the indicated time points. Each group
contained three mice and the results are representative of
three independent experiments. Columns, mean; bars, SD
(*, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.001).

We hypothesized that cisplatin enhanced the expression of
4-1BB on the T-cell surface, cross-linking of which produced more
antiapoptotic molecules, resulting in increased lymphocytes after
combination therapy. To create a system that measure 4-1BB
expression in both antigen-primed and naı̈ve CD8+ T cells
simultaneously, OT-1 CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into
congenic C57BL/6 mice, which were treated with OVA and/or
cisplatin. Cisplatin increased expression of 4-1BB on OVA/H2Kbpositive CD8+ T cells from day 1 of antigen injection; the higher
levels persisted until day 6 to 8, in which 4-1BB in cisplatin
plus OVA-treated mice f2-fold higher than in OVA alone group
(Fig. 2C). In separate experiments, we showed that enhanced
release of tumor antigen by cisplatin did not contribute to the
enhanced expression of 4-1BB and expansion of CD8+ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
Interestingly, cross-linking of 4-1BB in the presence of cisplatin
increased expression of Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 almost 2-fold compared
with anti–4-1BB alone. Expression of Bax, a molecule known to
induce cisplatin-mediated apoptosis of kidney epithelium (15), did
not change (Fig. 2D). Cisplatin-mediated enhancement of 4-1BB
expression on the T-cell surface and concomitant enhancement of
antiapoptotic molecules with anti–4-1BB treatment may contribute
to the rapid expansion of T cells and enhanced tumor killing
activity.
Cisplatin increased renal tubular damage dose dependently;
damage was limited and localized at 200 Ag but widespread in all
parts of the cortex at 400 or 800 Ag. However, high-dose tubular
damage was ameliorated with anti–4-1BB (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Combination treatment reduced the semiquantitative scores for
renal tubular epithelial cell necrosis (Supplementary Fig. S8) and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

loss by 2-fold compared with cisplatin alone (Fig. 3A). The
concentration of serum creatinine increased dose dependently
with cisplatin and decreased with addition of anti–4-1BB (Fig. 3B).
To explain 4-1BB–mediated amelioration of cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity, expression of 4-1BB (16) was examined in renal
tissue after cisplatin treatment in ex vivo. To minimize infiltration
of 4-1BB–expressing immune cells into the kidney, cisplatin was
injected into Rag2gc DKO mice at doses indicated. 4-1BB was
detected only in the kidneys from mice receiving 400 Ag or more
cisplatin but not in those receiving lower doses (Fig. 3CI and II).
4-1BB–positive cells were located in the kidney cortex where renal
tubular damage was increased by cisplatin (Fig. 3D).
4-1BB expression was detected in cisplatin-treated in vitro
cultured kidney epithelium but not in PBS-treated cells (Fig. 4A).
Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) constitutively expressed
4-1BB, which was marginally increased by cisplatin (Supplementary
Fig. S9). We tested whether cross-linking of 4-1BB on cultured
kidney epithelium enhanced the expression of antiapoptotic
molecules as with T cells (17, 18). Cisplatin decreased mRNA of
antiapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bfl-1; only the
decrease of Bfl-1 mRNA was statistically significant. Conversely,
combination with anti–4-1BB significantly increased the expression
of Bfl-1. The proapoptotic gene Bax increased with cisplatin
treatment and decreased with anti–4-1BB in vivo (Fig. 4B).
We tested whether the 4-1BB–mediated survival of kidney
epithelium was related to the changes in Bfl-1 and Bax expression
levels using gene-specific siRNA. Transfection of siRNA specific to
Bfl-1 or Bax decreased mRNA levels of Bfl-1 or Bax by 40% to 50%
of control siRNA in primary cultures of kidney epithelium (Fig. 4C).
Bfl-1 siRNA reduced anti–4-1BB–mediated survival of kidney

epithelium by 32.5% compared with the control, whereas Bax
siRNA enhanced the survival of kidney epithelium by 2.14-fold
compared with cisplatin alone and by 1.46-fold compared with
cisplatin plus anti–4-1BB (Fig. 4D). We concluded that cisplatin
directly enhances 4-1BB expression in renal tubular epithelial
cells, which is involved in the anti–4-1BB–mediated protection of
kidney epithelial cells by regulating the expression of antiapoptotic
and proapoptotic molecules.
It seems that ciplatin does not produce any tumor-killing
activities against CT26 (Fig. 1); the therapeutic effects of anti–41BB plus cisplatin were completely dependent on both primary and
secondary antitumor activities of CD8+ T cells. This suggests that
cisplatin rather preconditions the host, possibly dampening the
immunosuppressive network, and providing the necessary lymphoid space and cytokine milieu for augmented 4-1BB–mediated
expansion and differentiation of CD8+ T cells.
It is noteworthy that B cells were the most sensitive to cisplatin
toxicity and anti–4-1BB was very effective in repopulating B cells
(Fig. 2). Anti–4-1BB may cross-link 4-1BB on the B-cell surface (19)
or alternatively repopulated CD4+ T cells may provide growth
factors for B cells. Cisplatin enhanced 4-1BB expression on antigenprimed CD8+ T cells and anti–4-1BB markedly enhanced the
repopulation of lymphocytes (Fig. 2). Because 4-1BB is induced in
an antigen-specific manner, the majority of repopulated T cells
are likely against tumor antigens. Although we could not directly
quantify the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in current studies because

of the unavailability of CT26-specific tetramers, we found that, in
another tumor model (B16 melanoma), the major portion of the
CD8+ T cells repopulated by anti–4-1BB were tumor-antigen
specific.4
It is a novel finding that cisplatin induced 4-1BB on the kidney
epithelium (Fig. 3). Provision of the antiapoptotic signals to renal
tubular epithelium by anti–4-1BB seemed to contribute to the
improvement in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Both enhancement of Bfl-1 and suppression of Bax (Fig. 4) seem important
factors involved in anti–4-1BB–mediated amelioration of nephrotoxicity.
Current studies suggest that one single type of chemotherapy or
immunotherapy may not be able to deal with all facets of tumor
progression, and tumor- and immune system–derived regulatory
barriers. Therefore, a rational combination of synergistic chemotherapy and immunotherapy could provide a successful clinical
approach to human cancers.
