We recently developed a new group of folate-conjugated Vinca
alkaloids, one of which, EC145, emerged as a candidate for
clinical development. Brief treatment of nude mice bearing
f100 mm3 folate receptor-positive human xenografts led to
complete response (CR) in 5/5 mice and cures (i.e., remission
without a relapse for >90 days post-tumor implantation) in 4/5
mice. Multiple CRs and cures were also noted when EC145 was
used to treat mice initially bearing tumors as large as 750
mm3. Likewise, complete cures (5/5) resulted following the
treatment of an aggressive folate receptor–positive J6456
lymphoma model. The activity of EC145 was not accompanied
by noticeable weight loss or major organ tissue degeneration.
Furthermore, no significant antitumor activity (0/5 CR) was
observed in EC145-treated animals that were co-dosed with an
excess of a benign folate ligand, thus demonstrating the
target-specific activity of EC145. The enhanced therapeutic
index due to folate conjugation was also evidenced by the fact
that the unconjugated drug (desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide) was found to be completely inactive when administered
at nontoxic dose levels and only marginally active when given
at highly toxic dose levels. Subsequent dose regimen studies
confirmed that EC145 given on a more frequent, qdx5
schedule resulted in the most effective antitumor response
as compared with an equivalent total dose given on thrice- or
single-injection-per-week schedule. Taken together, these
studies show that EC145 has significant antiproliferative
activity and tolerability, thus lending support to an ongoing
phase 1 trial for the treatment of advanced malignancies.

clinically (3, 4), and some will no doubt find their way to the
marketplace. Due to their large molecular size of f150,000 Da,
MAbs typically clear from the blood and the body much more
slowly compared with small-molecular-weight agents, a consequence that could lead to significant and unwanted drug exposure
to normal organs. Some immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules also
show relatively poor diffusion from the vasculature and into
tumors (5). Hence, we have hypothesized that replacing the MAb
targeting ligand with a smaller but high affinity receptor-targeting
ligand (e.g., folate) could possibly improve blood clearance and also
enable better tumor penetration of attached drugs.1
The vitamin folate has been successfully used to deliver
numerous therapeutic- and imaging-based agents to cells that
express the folate receptor (FR) protein (6–10). The FR is a highaffinity membrane protein (K d f 0.1–1 nmol/L for folic acid) that
is functionally expressed in high quantities by many primary and
metastatic cancers (11–13); and it has been successfully exploited
for drug delivery purposes using a wide range of drug payloads
(6–10, 14–22). We have previously described the biological activity
of EC145, a novel folate conjugate of the powerful microtubuledestabilizing agent, desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH;
a derivative of the natural product vinblastine).2 Like vinblastine,
DAVLBH is a Vinca alkaloid that is capable of disrupting the
formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby inhibiting cell division
and causing cell death. EC145, the water soluble folate conjugate
of DAVLBH, was found to produce marked antitumor effect against
FR-positive tumors using well tolerated regimens.2 Herein, we
report on our continued in vivo preclinical investigation of EC145,
with particular emphasis on target specificity, efficacy toward large
s.c. tumors, and optimized dosing regimens.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Abstract

Anticancer drugs generally affect all types of rapidly proliferating
cells, and consequently, their therapeutic indices are narrow. Severe
side effects are often observed, and clinical doses are more or less
empirically determined by the risk of severe toxicity. In an effort
to enhance the selectivity of a drug and simultaneously reduce
unwanted toxicity (i.e., improving the therapeutic index), we and
others have been developing tumor-targeted agents that display
enhanced tumor-specific cell killing relative to their unconjugated
drug counterparts. For example, Mylotarg is a monoclonal antibody
(MAb)-drug conjugate that was approved for the treatment of
acute myeloid leukemia, and it represents the first antibodytargeted drug conjugate on the market (1, 2). Likewise, many
alternative antibody-drug conjugates are currently being tested

Materials. Pteroic acid (Pte) and N 10-trifluoroacetyl-Pte were prepared
according to Xu et al. (23). Peptide synthesis reagents were purchased from
NovaBiochem and Bachem. EC145 was synthesized as previously described
(24). EC20 (FolateScan; Pte-D-gGlu-hDpr-Asp-Cys) was prepared as
previously described (25). Rhodamine isothiocyanate was purchased from
Aldrich. All other common reagents were purchased from Sigma or other
major suppliers.
Synthesis, purification and analytic characterization of EC0260
and EC58. The D-enantiomer of EC145, EC0260, was prepared by the
same procedure as for EC145 with the exception that D-configured amino
acid derivatives were used in the process. The final conjugates were purified
by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Waters
NovaPak C18 19  300 mm) with 1 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH, 7.0;
solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) using a gradient consisting of 10%
B to 50% B over 30 min at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. Acetonitrile was
removed from the collected fractions i vac, and the residues were subjected

to freeze-drying to give yellow amorphous solids. Liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data [ESI: (M + H)+ = 1,918] and 1H-nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) signals were in agreement with the proposed
structures for EC145 and EC0260. In brief, the 1H-NMR spectrum of each
compound (300 MHz, D2O) contains 11 aromatic signals in the range from
6.4 to 8.8 ppm ( five from the folate moiety and six from DAVLBH moiety).
The signals for the two olefinic protons in DAVLBH appear at 5.5 ppm (d)
and 5.7 ppm (m).
EC58 was prepared as follows. The folate-containing spacer unit
N 10-trifluoroacetyl-Pte-DgGlu-DgGlu-Lys-OH was synthesized using standard fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-based solid-phase peptide synthesis
(Fmoc SPPS) on a Wang-resin polymeric support. It was purified by
preparative HPLC (Waters NovaPak C18 19  300 mm) with 10 mmol/L
NH4OAc (pH, 5; solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) using a gradient
consisting of 1% B to 20% B over 40 min at a flow rate of 15 mL/min. The
structure of this compound was confirmed by LC-MS [ESI: (M + H)+ = 795].
About 67 mg (85 Amol) of N 10-trifluoroacetyl-Pte-DgGlu-DgGlu-Lys-OH
were dissolved in 1.0 mL of DMSO, and to the well-stirred solution were
added 50 mg (93 Amol) of rhodamine isothiocyanate and 30 AL (170 Amol)
of N, N-diisopropylethylamine. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 6 h. DMSO was removed by freeze drying, and the crude
product was reconstituted in 1 mmol/L NH4HCO3 (solvent A) for 30 min at
room temperature, followed by preparative HPLC purification [Waters
NovaPak C18 19  300 mm column with solvent A and acetonitrile (solvent
B) using a gradient consisting of 1% B to 50% B over 60 min at a flow rate of
15 mL/min]. LC-MS [ESI: (M + H)+ = 1,142; (M
H)+ = 1,140] was in
agreement with the expected structure.
In vivo antitumor experiments. Four- to six-week-old female nu/nu
mice (Charles River) or six- to seven-week-old female BALB/c mice (Harlan
Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) were maintained on a standard 12-h light-dark cycle
and fed ad libitum with folate-deficient chow (Harlan diet TD00434; Harlan
Teklad) for the duration of the experiment. Because normal rodent chow
contains a high concentration of folic acid (6 mg/kg chow), mice used in
these studies were maintained on the folate-free diet for 2 weeks before
tumor implantation to reduce serum folate concentrations from an initial
average of 720 to f25 nmol/L, which is close to the range of normal human
serum (9–14 nmol/L; ref. 26). FR-positive human nasopharyngeal KB cells
(f75 pmol FR/mg protein; ref. 27; American Type Culture Collection) and
J6456 murine lymphoma cells were grown continuously as a monolayer or
in suspension, respectively, using folate-free RPMI containing 10% heatinactivated FCS (HIFCS) at 37jC in a 5% CO2/95% air-humidified
atmosphere with no antibiotics. The HIFCS contains endogenous folates
at concentrations sufficient for FR-expressing cells to survive and
proliferate in this medium (14), which consequently is more physiologically
relevant than typical cell culture media, which contain 100- to 1,000-fold
higher levels of folates. KB cells (1  106 per nu/nu mouse) or J6456 cells
(1  106 per BALB/c mouse) in 100 AL were injected in the subcutis of the
dorsal medial area. Mice were divided into groups of five, and test articles
were freshly prepared and injected through the lateral tail vein under sterile
conditions in a volume of 200 AL of PBS. I.v. treatments were typically
initiated on day 9 post-tumor cell implantation when the KB tumors were
f70 to 110 mm3 in volume, and on day 19 post–tumor cell inoculation
(PTI) when the J6456 tumors were f100 to 160 mm3 in volume. In the large
KB tumor study, mice were dosed 13 days PTI in the 250-mm3 group,
20 days PTI in the 500-mm3 group, and 24 days PTI in the 750-mm3 group.
The mice in the control groups received no treatment. Growth of each s.c.
tumor was followed by measuring the tumor thrice per week (TIW) during
treatment and twice per week thereafter until a volume of 1,500 mm3 was
reached. Tumors were measured in two perpendicular directions using
Vernier calipers, and their volumes were calculated as 0.5  L  W 2, where
L = measurement of longest axis in millimeters and W = measurement of
axis perpendicular to L in millimeters. As a general measure of toxicity,
changes in body weights were determined on the same schedule as tumor
volume measurements. Survival of animals was monitored daily. Animals
that were moribund (or unable to reach food or water) were euthanized by
CO2 asphyxiation. All in vivo studies were done in accordance with the
American Accreditation Association of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines.

Drug toxicity was assessed by collecting blood via cardiac puncture and
submitting the sera and whole blood for independent analysis of serum
chemistry and hematologic parameters at Ani-Lytics, Inc. In addition,
histopathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed heart, lungs, liver, spleen,
kidney, intestine, skeletal muscle, and bone (tibia/fibula) were done at
Animal Reference Pathology Laboratories.
Tumor response criteria. For individual tumors, a partial response (PR)
was defined as volume regression >50% but with measurable tumor
(>2 mm3) remaining at all times. Complete response (CR) was defined as a
disappearance of measurable tumor mass (<2 mm3) at some point within
90 days after tumor implantation. Cures were defined as CRs without tumor
regrowth within the 90-day study time frame.
FolateScan (99mTc-EC20) uptake in BALB/c mice bearing M109
tumors. An EC20 kit was used for the preparation of radioactive drug
substance (25). Each kit contains a sterile, nonpyrogenic lyophilized mixture
of 0.1 mg of EC20, 80 mg of sodium a-D-glucoheptonate dihydrate, 80 Ag of
tin(II) chloride dihydrate, and sufficient sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric
acid to adjust the pH to 6.8 F 0.2. Chelation of 99mTc to EC20 was done by
injecting 1 mL of sodium pertechnetate 99mTc injection (<50 mCi) into this
vial and heating it for f18 min in a boiling water bath. Samples of the
99m
Tc-EC20 solution were analyzed for radiochemical purity using a HPLC
system consisting of a Waters 600E Multisolvent Delivery System and 490
UV detector, a Bioscan FC-3200 radiodetector, Laura v1.5 radiochromatogram software, and a Waters Nova-Pak C18 (3.9  150 mm) column.
Injected samples were eluted isocratically using an aqueous mobile phase
containing 20% methanol and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of
1 mL/min. The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-EC20 was >90% (25).
Female BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks of age) were maintained on a folate-free
diet for a total of 4 weeks before the biodistribution experiment. Syngeneic,
FR-positive murine lung adenocarcinoma tumor cells (M109; f25 pmol FR/
mg protein; 1  106 cells per animal) were inoculated in the subcutis of the
dorsal medial area of the right axilla (27). Stock 99mTc-EC20 solutions
containing 100 Ag of agent per milliliter were prepared on the day of use.
Mice with 200- to 500-mm3 M109 tumors received a 99mTc-EC20 dose of
0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 Amol/kg in 200 AL sterile PBS via a tail vein. Four hours
post-injection, animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and dissected.
Tumors and livers were removed and weighed, and their radioactivity
content was measured in an automatic gamma counter to determine 99mTc
distribution. Uptake of the radiopharmaceutical, expressed as percent
injected dose of wet weight tissue (% ID/g), was calculated by reference to
standards prepared from dilutions of the injected preparation (20).
Folate-rhodamine uptake into M109 tumors. BALB/c mice bearing
400- to 600-mm3 M109 tumors received 2 Amol/kg of EC58, a folaterhodamine conjugate, or unconjugated rhodamine i.v. in 200 AL of PBS. One
hour later, mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and tumors were
harvested. Tumor slices (1 to 2 mm thick) were covered with Tissue Tek
OCT compound and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tumor slices
were frozen to 20jC and then sectioned (7 Am thick) using a Leica
CM3050 Cryostat. The sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33258
(1.2 Ag/mL) for 10 min. The tumor sections were mounted using anti-fade
(Biomeda) liquid mount and then imaged using a Leica DMLB fluorescent
microscope.

Results
FR-specific in vivo potency of EC145. Initial experiments
were carried out in athymic nude mice bearing s.c. implanted,
FR-expressing KB xenografts (70–110 mm3). In our lab, the human
KB xenograft is a relatively quick-growing tumor that reproducibly
displays log-linear growth and reaches a volume of about 1,500
mm3 within f30 days post s.c. tumor implantation (1  106 cells)
on the back of female nu/nu mice. The activity of EC145 against
this model was assessed by giving the drug 9 days PTI using a
2 Amol/kg dose level and following a TIW, 2-week schedule. As
shown in Fig. 1B, EC145 generated remarkable antitumor effect
where 5/5 animals displayed a CR, of which four of the five animals

Figure 1. Comparison of the therapeutic
efficacy of EC145 and EC0260 against
s.c. FR-positive KB tumor growth. KB
tumor cells (1  106) were inoculated s.c.
into nude mice, and therapy started on
randomized mice with tumors in the 70- to
110-mm3 range. The therapeutic regimen
consisted of i.v. doses of 2 Amol/kg

schedule. A, untreated controls; B, EC145;

maintained the CR (i.e., cures) throughout the 90-day duration of
the study. In contrast, when co-dosed with a modest 20-fold molar
excess of a benign water-soluble folate analogue (EC20), EC145
failed to produce any meaningful antitumor activity (zero CRs and
two PRs; see Fig. 1C). This outcome indicated that the activity of
EC145 was predominantly dependent on binding to tumorassociated FRs. Furthermore, EC145-treated animals did not lose
any significant weight throughout the dosing period; and no
durable tissue damage was observed upon histologic examination
of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and heart as done on animals
euthanized 80 to 120 days after EC145 administration, which is
consistent with our earlier report.2
EC145 is constructed with an all L-peptide spacer conjugated to
the g-carboxylic acid of folate’s glutamyl residue (24). To better
understand the importance of the stereochemical configuration of
the linker with regard to its overall pharmacology, the all-D
enantiomer (EC0260) was synthesized. We have previously reported
that EC145 has a affinity of 0.47 relative to that of folic acid for
human FRs.2,3 When a similar assay was done on EC0260, the re
ive affinity was determined to be f0.2. As shown in Fig. 1D,
EC0260 was found to be less active against established KB tumors
than EC145 by producing only two CRs, three PRs, and one cure.
This lower observed therapeutic efficacy may have been due to the
slightly reduced affinity of EC0260 for the FR. Regardless, the data
in Fig. 1 collectively show that EC145 is the better agent for
FR-targeted therapy.
Antitumor effect of DAVLBH, the nontargeted form of
EC145. To better determine the approximate therapeutic range of
the unconjugated DAVLBH drug, nu/nu mice bearing 70- to 110mm3 KB tumors were treated with three different doses (0.5, 1, and

3
As has been observed with other folate conjugates, such as folate-mitomycin (28),
we expect this high level of affinity to be maintained with mouse FRs.

2 Amol/kg) of this agent following a TIW, 2-week regimen; tumor
growth and body weight were subsequently monitored. As shown
in Fig. 2A, antiproliferative activity was clearly absent when
DAVLBH was dosed at a nontoxic level (0.5 Amol/kg). When dosed
with 1 Amol/kg, DAVLBH produced minimal antitumor activity
(zero CRs; five PRs) but caused weight loss of up to 14% (see Fig. 2B
and D). In the high-dose 2 Amol/kg cohort, mice could only be
dosed thrice with DAVLBH before losing as much as 20% weight
(Fig. 2C and D). These results are in stark contrast to that produced
from DAVLBH’s folate-targeted counterpart; because therapy with
2 Amol/kg of EC145 produced 4/5 cures without any weight loss
(compare Figs. 1 and 2). Unlike EC145, DAVLBH clearly seems to
possess a very narrow therapeutic range.
Antitumor activity against an aggressive lymphoma model.
EC145 was also tested for activity against an aggressive FR-positive
J6456 lymphoma tumor model. Following the s.c. implantation of
1 million cells per animal, tumors typically reach a volume of 1,500
mm3 within f26 days. Here, BALB/c mice bearing s.c. J6456
lymphoma tumors were treated with 2 Amol/kg of EC145 TIW, for
2 consecutive weeks. As shown in Fig. 3B, tumors in all five treated
mice had quickly regressed and did not relapse during the study
period (i.e., 5/5 cures). EC145 therapy was also found to be well
tolerated in the BALB/c mice, and its toxicity profile was similar to
that observed in the nu/nu mice (see Fig. 3D). Together with the
results shown in Fig. 1, EC145 seems to be a very effective agent for
treating FR-positive tumors.
EC145 can eradicate large, well-established KB tumor
xenografts. In an attempt to relate tumor size with the antitumor
efficacy of EC145, we dosed mice with 2 Amol/kg of EC145, TIW for
3 consecutive weeks beginning when the tumor volumes measured
250, 500, or 750 mm3. In the 250-mm3 group, treatment with EC145
produced CRs in four of five mice within 14 to 21 days from the
initiation of therapy, and three of these animals were presumed to
be cured (Fig. 4B). In the 500-mm3 group, EC145 continued to
provide a strong therapeutic effect with two CRs and three PRs, of

which one animal was cured (Fig. 4C). Remarkably, antitumor
efficacy was strong even against the largest sized tumors (750-mm3
tumors), where two CRs, three PRs, and two cures were observed
(Fig. 4D). Interestingly, at the end of the 3-week treatment, the
tumor regrowth rate in two of the three relapsed mice from this
latter group was considerably slower than control tumor growth
rates.
Intratumoral accessibility of folate conjugates. The data in
Fig. 4 clearly indicate that EC145 can produce meaningful anti-

tumor effect against very large s.c. tumors. However, it did
seem that the net activity decreased with the size of tumor.
We questioned whether this compromised activity was the
result of ending therapy too soon, or was it due to inefficient
cellular targeting within such large malignant masses. To
address the latter issue, nude mice bearing large 500-mm3 KB
tumors were injected i.v. with 2 Amol/kg of EC58, a folaterhodamine conjugate. One hour postinjection, mice were sacrificed; their tumors were excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and

then sectioned for fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5B,
tumor cells in these microscopic sections, both at the center and
periphery of the tumor, were first identified by ex vivo nuclear
staining with Hoechst 33258 (blue fluorescence). Imaging of these
sections in the same optical field for rhodamine fluorescence
revealed that all of the tumor cells in the center as well as the
periphery had been uniformly stained with EC58 (Fig. 5A). As a

control for specificity, Fig. 5C shows that KB tumors in mice
injected with unconjugated rhodamine did not significantly
emit fluorescence. These data confirm that all of the tissue
throughout a large tumor is readily accessible to a smallmolecular-weight folate-conjugate, thereby suggesting that more
durable antitumor responses might be feasible with continued
therapy (see Discussion).

Optimization of EC145 treatment schedule. Animal models
allow for the investigation of a range of dose levels and schedules
to help guide clinical investigation. Hence, to get a better idea on
the effect of dose and schedule on the efficacy and toxicity of
EC145, mice were treated with a fixed amount of this agent
(12 Amol/kg total) spread out over a 3-week period and dosed
according to varied but defined regimens. The following doses
and schedules were used: (a) 1.2 Amol/kg, qdx5 for 2 consecutive
weeks; (b) 1.2 Amol/kg, qdx5 during weeks 1 and 3; (c) 2 Amol/kg,
TIW for 2 consecutive weeks, (d) 2 Amol/kg, qdx5 during weeks
1 and 3; and (e) 4 Amol/kg, single injection per week (SIW) for
3 consecutive weeks. As shown in Fig. 6A, both qdx5 regimens
produced 100% cures; thus, having the second week off from
therapy did not adversely impact response when the agent
was administered daily. Furthermore, when gross and histopathologic examinations were done, none of these treated mice
showed any signs of tumor at the end of the study (92 days).
Administration of EC145 on a TIW schedule was found to be
somewhat less active; but more importantly, having 1 week of
rest in between the dosing period was found to significantly
compromise the therapeutic effect when dosed according to
this less frequent schedule. For instance, EC145 given TIW for
2 consecutive weeks produced four of five cures with one PR,
whereas EC145 given TIW every other week yielded two CRs,
three PRs, and only one cure (Fig. 6B). The latter regimen was
found to be comparable to the 4 Amol/kg, SIW 3-week regimen,
where two CRs, three PRs, and one cure were noted (Fig. 6C).
Importantly, none of these dosing regimens resulted in significant toxicity to the treated mice (Fig. 6D). From these results, it
was concluded that a dose-dense, daily administration (qdx5) of
EC145 was superior to all of the less frequent dosing regimens.
Rationale for dose-dense regimens. In an attempt to relate
the surprisingly high antitumor effect produced by administering
EC145 more frequently at lower dose levels to the quantitative
tumor uptake of folate conjugates, BALB/c mice bearing FR-

positive M109 tumors were dosed with increasing amounts of
Tc-EC20 (Folate-Scan; refs. 20, 25, 29) and then sacrificed
4 h later to measure the uptake of this radiodiagnostic agent in
tumor (target tissue; f25 pmol FR/mg protein) and liver
(nontarget tissue; f0.1 pmol FR/mg protein; ref. 27). 99mTc-EC20
is a well-known, small-molecular-weight, folate-based agent that
readily binds to FR-positive tissue following i.v. administration
(20, 25); this agent is also currently being used in the clinic for
determining patient eligibility for experimental folate-targeted
therapies (Endocyte, Inc.).
As shown in Table 1A, 99mTc-EC20 uptake in liver (L) tissue
increased rather proportionally to the dose administered, but the
uptake in the tumor (T) was apparently saturated at bolus dose
levels >3 Amol/kg. The tumor-to-liver uptake ratios (T/L) at each
dose are also summarized in Table 1A. The T/L ratio peaked at a
dose of f0.3 Amol/kg, above which there was a disproportionate
increase in the liver uptake as compared with that in the tumor.
Using the dose levels applied in the aforementioned schedule study
(Fig. 6) and the values in Table 1A, we estimated the T and L
uptake levels provided by a single EC145 dose and then calculated
the total uptake that these tissues could have experienced for each
evaluated regimen. For example, 2.5% of a single 1.2 Amol/kg EC145
dose was estimated to be captured per gram of tumor or a total of
25.4% ID/g over the entire 10-dose regimen (i.e., qdx5, 2 weeks). As
summarized in Table 1B, tumor uptake was found to be
significantly greater when EC145 was administered at lower dose
levels but following a more frequent schedule (contrast 25.4%
versus 12.3% net uptake for the qdx5 and SIW regimens,
respectively). Importantly, this drop in tumor uptake could easily
explain the observed reduction in the antitumor effect of EC145
when dosed using the less frequent, higher dose level regimens
(see Fig. 6). The T/L ratio was also greatest when EC145 was
administered daily. Curiously, total liver uptake was found to
be less affected by the dose and schedule perhaps because
this organ is involved in the clearance of folate conjugates via a

non-FR–mediated mechanism.4 Overall, these data clearly show
that folate-targeted agents may be best administered following
more frequent dosing regimens.
Preliminary toxicity assessment. Aside from minimal weight
loss during EC145 therapy, no other obvious gross toxicities were
observed.2 Formal Good-Laboratory-Practice toxicology studies
have been completed with EC145 in both rodents and dogs to
support the filing of an Investigational New Drug application.
Particular findings that defined the maximum tolerated dose were
related to proliferative compartment toxicities, such as the
gastrointestinal tract and the hematopoietic system.4 However, all
toxicities were declared to be reversible.

Discussion
In this report, we provide additional evidence that EC145, a
folate-conjugated Vinca alkaloid, produces a highly potent and
specific antitumor effect against FR-expressing tumors in nu/nu
and BALB/c mice. Following brief cycles of therapy, tumors were
repeatedly observed to shrink, often without recurrence, when
using regimens that produced little if any noticeable weight loss or
adverse events. The fact that such effects were seen in multiple FRpositive models (including the M109 model previously reported)2
suggests that EC145 may be a useful agent in the fight against some
human cancers.
Initial studies in mice suggested that EC145 was more potent
and far less toxic than its unconjugated drug counterpart,
DAVLBH.2 To confirm our earlier findings and using a direct
comparison approach, tumor-bearing animals received increasing

amounts of DAVLBH according to a TIW, 2-week schedule (i.e., a
regimen known to be very efficacious and well tolerated for EC145).
Importantly, no activity was observed when DAVLBH was dosed at
a seemingly nontoxic level (0.5 Amol/kg), and only PRs were noted
at the 1 Amol/kg maximum tolerated level, where mice lost f14%
of their weight. In our animal model, DAVLBH was not tolerable at
the 2 Amol/kg level when given more than thrice. Unlike EC145,
DAVLBH obviously has a very narrow therapeutic index.
Increased tumor burden is usually associated with reduced
chemotherapeutic efficacy. One plausible explanation for this effect
is that the tumor cells located further away from the nearest
capillary are actually less accessible to parenterally administered
drugs. Although EC145 is a targeted agent, its ability to access
tumor cells is still presumably governed by the laws of
extravascular diffusion; however, compared with its untargeted
drug counterpart, EC145 has the distinct advantage of docking to
the tumor cells and being endocytosed by virtue of the high-affinity
FR. To directly address the performance of EC145 against larger
tumors, we delayed the onset of therapy to animals until their
tumors were 250, 500, or 750 mm3 in volume. Here, we observed
strong antitumor responses among all three cohorts, including 2/5
cures in the largest 750-mm3 tumor group. These results suggested
that even as the tumor increased in size, the cells within the
malignant mass remained accessible to folate conjugates, like
EC145. To confirm that hypothesis, mice bearing large s.c. tumors
were injected with a fluorescent folate-rhodamine conjugate, and
bright fluorescence was observed to be uniformly diffused
throughout the tumor. In other words, all tumor cells within the
large malignant mass seemed to be labeled and, hence, readily
accessible to the systemically administered folate-targeted agent.
These findings are consistent with a previous report from our
group which showed that FR-targeted 99mTc-EC20 tumor uptake

increased proportionally to the size of the tumor (20). Taken
together, these data provide optimism that small-molecular-weight,
folate-targeted agents may be useful for treating patients with
large, inoperable tumor burden. Furthermore, because the treated
animals did not experience any observable adverse affects during
therapy, it may also be possible to obtain more pronounced
antitumor activity with EC145 by simply extending the duration of
treatment. Although extended i.v. dosing regimens are typically
difficult to conduct with mice, such manipulations would be
feasible at the clinical level.
The preclinical phase of drug development provides an excellent
opportunity to evaluate the effect of dosage and treatment
schedules on therapeutic efficacy. Admittedly, an optimal treatment regimen defined for mice may not directly translate to
success in the clinic; but because little is known about the
translation of folate-targeted therapeutics, our laboratory elected
to study the effects of altering the dosing regimen on the
performance of EC145 in mice with the hopes of providing some
guidance to clinicians. In fact, we were curious whether a dosedense (metronomic) approach would be useful in the setting of
folate-targeted therapy simply because it seemed sensible to
maximize FR loading with EC145 by dosing this agent more
frequently. Our approach reported above tested the effects of
administering a fixed total quantity of EC145 (12 Amol/kg) spread
over a 3-week period. Of the three schedules evaluated (qdx5, TIW,
and SIW), EC145 was found to be most efficacious (100% cures)
against FR-positive tumors when administered at low, but more
frequent (qdx5) doses; furthermore, EC145 was determined to be
least effective when given at high, less frequent doses. Curious
about these findings, we examined the dose-dependent biodistribution profiles of 99mTc-EC20 (FolateScan; a folate-drug surrogate)
and found that the reduced activity observed with less frequent,
higher dose regimens of EC145 could possibly be explained by a
nonlinear tumor uptake property (due to the receptor saturating
phenomenon; see Table 1A). Theoretical calculations suggested
that the total drug uptake in the tumor following the qdx5 regimen
could have been 30% greater than with the TIW schedule and
f100% greater than with the SIW regimen. Given the steep doseresponse curves for many chemotherapeutic agents, these

increases in tumor uptake of the drug are significant and should
translate into improvements of therapeutic efficacy. Interestingly,
FolateScan uptake in liver (a FR-negative, nontargeted organ;
ref. 27) increased linearly and was proportional to the administered
dose. Consequently, one might predict that a less frequent, larger
dose regimen may not only result in lower antitumor effect, but
also a corresponding increase in toxicity. With these data, we
believe that the choice of administration schedule may be more
important for folate-targeted therapeutic agents than simply
increasing the dose level. Admittedly, we do recognize that more
frequent treatment schedules mean that both patients and
clinicians will be encumbered with more responsibility and
workload. However, compliance for such approaches might actually
be high if response rates are shown to increase, and toxicities are
determined to be low or easily managed.
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis of EC145 has shown that it
has a serum half life of f1.3 min in mice. Similar rapid tissue
distribution and elimination phenomena have also been observed
for other folate-drug conjugates in mice, such as folate-mitomycin
(1 min plasma half life; ref. 28) and 99mTc-EC20 (4 min plasma half
life; ref. 25); thus, the characteristics of EC145 seem to be
representative for this class of targeted small molecules. Overall,
EC145 seems to be a potent, folate-targeted chemotherapeutic that
displays significant efficacy and tolerability in multiple FR-positive
models. These exciting preclinical qualities have warranted the
continued study of this molecule as well as provided justification for
the start of EC145’s Phase 1 clinical trial back in March 2006.
Because the screening of a wide variety of human cancers has
detected elevated functional FR expression levels on ovarian, renal,
endometrial, lung, and breast cancers (27), EC145 may find itself to
be most efficacious against some of these important clinical targets.
