ABSTRACT
Clinical studies propose a causative link between the consumption of alcohol and
the development and progression of liver disease in obese individuals. However, it is
incompletely understood how alcohol and obesity interact and whether the combined
effects are additive or synergistic. In this study, we developed an in vitro model to
address this question. Lipid accumulation in primary human hepatocytes was induced
by incubation with oleic acid. Subsequently, steatotic and control hepatocytes were
incubated with up to 50 mM alcohol. This alcohol concentration on its own revealed
only minimal effects but significantly enhanced oleate-induced lipogenesis and cellular
triglyceride content compared to control cells. Similarly, lipid peroxidation, oxidative
stress and pro-inflammatory gene expression as well as CYP2E1 levels and activity
were synergistically induced by alcohol and steatosis. CYP2E1 inhibition blunted these
synergistic pathological effects. Notably, alcohol and cellular steatosis also induced
autophagy in a synergistic manner, and also this was mediated via CYP2E1. Further
induction of autophagy ameliorated the joint effects of alcohol and oleic acid on
hepatocellular lipid accumulation and inflammatory gene expression while inhibition
of autophagy further enhanced the dual pathological effects. Further analyses
revealed that the joint synergistic effect of alcohol and steatosis on autophagy was
mediated via activation of the JNK-pathway. In summary, our data indicate that
alcohol induces not only pathological but also protective mechanisms in steatotic
hepatocytes via CYP2E1. These findings may have important implications on the
prognosis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease particularly in obese individuals.

INTRODUCTION

and even less progress to significant hepatic fibrosis
and cirrhosis. Still, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is the
second most common reason for liver transplantation in
the United States and Europe, which clearly indicates the
need to unravel the mechanisms and factors promoting
hepatic injury in ALD [1, 2].

Chronic alcohol consumption is one of the main
etiological factors for liver disease worldwide; however,
only a fraction of drinkers develop significant hepatic
inflammation known as alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH),

More recently, the pathophysiological significance
of hepatic lipid accumulation in the absence of significant
alcohol consumption is increasingly recognized. Thus,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now consider
ed the most common cause of liver enzyme elevations in
Western countries [3]. NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic
manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, characterized by
central obesity and insulin resistance, resulting in diabetes
type 2, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [4]. Similarly to
ALD, NAFLD encompasses a wide range of pathological
conditions from mild hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis
(nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) with significant
necroinflammation and progressive fibrosis. In its
advanced form, NASH is believed to account for a large
fraction, if not entirely for what was previously termed
“cryptogenic cirrhosis” [5].
Several studies suggest that hepatic steatosis alone
can prime the liver to progress to more serious pathologies
upon its exposure to subsequent metabolic stressors such
as alcohol [6, 7]. Carmiel-Haggai et al. showed that shortterm binge alcohol exposure increased apoptosis and
liver injury in obese rats compared to lean controls [8].
Recently, we have shown that chronic alcohol application
in combination with a high fat diet significantly enhanced
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis compared to alcohol
or high fat diet alone [9]. Also clinical studies suggest a
strong causative link between alcohol consumption and
progressive liver disease in individuals with high fat-intake
or obesity. Obese alcoholics have an accentuated elevation
in serum transaminase levels [10, 11]. Furthermore, in
subjects with heavy alcohol consumption, obesity is an
independent risk factor for the development of both acute
alcohol-induced hepatitis and cirrhosis [12, 13]. Even
moderate alcohol consumption leads to an increase of
liver enzymes with rising body mass index (BMI) [14].
Moreover, both elevated BMI and alcohol consumption
are related to the progression of chronic liver disease,
with evidence of a synergistic interaction between the two
factors [15].
Alcohol as well as dietary lipids are predominantly
metabolized in hepatocytes, rendering the interactions
between alcohol- and lipid-metabolism very likely.
Alcohol undergoes enzymatically-catalyzed oxidative
metabolism to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) and microsomal cytochrome P450 CYP2E1.
The resulting acetaldehyde is further oxidized by
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to acetate which
leads ultimately to lipid accumulation, reactive oxygen
species (ROS) formation and induction of oxidative stress
[16]. On the other hand, hepatocellular lipid accumulation
impairs the oxidative capacity of mitochondria and
stimulates peroxisomal and microsomal pathways of
fat oxidation, leading to additional oxidative stress that
triggers production of inflammatory cytokines [17, 18].
However, it is incompletely understood how alcohol and
obesity interact and whether the combined effects on the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

progression of liver injury are additive or synergistic.
The present study aimed to establish an in vitro
model to study the effect of moderate alcohol levels on
steatotic hepatocytes and to unravel the interacting effects
between hepatocellular lipid accumulation and alcohol
metabolism.

RESULTS
Effects of alcohol and oleic acid on hepatocellular
lipid synthesis and accumulation
To study the combined effect of alcohol and oleic
acid (oleate) on PHH, we chose an oleate concentration of
0.2 mM and an alcohol (Alc) concentration of 50 mM. We
have previous shown that hepatocellular steatosis induced
by this oleate concentration led to pathological alterations
similar to those found in hepatic tissue of NAFLDpatients [19, 20]. Furthermore, previous in vitro studies
have revealed that in vitro exposure of hepatic cells to 50
mM alcohol mimics the situation of “moderate” alcohol
consumption in humans [21-23]. In these concentrations,
neither oleate or alcohol alone nor the alcohol and
oleate combination affected the viability of PHH in vitro
within 48h (Suppl.Figure S1A-C). Analysis of cellular
triglyceride (TG) levels and oil red O staining showed
that alcohol as well as oleate induced lipid accumulation
in PHH (Figure 1A, 1B). Interestingly, the oleate and
alcohol combination led to a significantly higher lipid
accumulation in PHH than either of the two stimuli alone
(Figure 1A, 1B).
In search for the underlying mechanisms of this
synergistic effect of alcohol and oleate we analyzed
the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) the key
enzyme of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Alcohol or oleate
alone had slight effects on FASN mRNA levels but the
alcohol/oleate combination significantly enhanced FASN
expression in PHH (Figure 1C). Similarly, alcohol and
oleate synergistically up-regulated the gene expression
of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), which catalyzes
a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty
acids, and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 and 2,
which catalyze the final step in triglyceride formation
from diacylglycerol and Acyl-CoA (Figure 1D, 1E and
Suppl.Figure S2). Together, these data show a synergistic
effect of oleate and alcohol stimulation on lipogenesis and
cellular lipid accumulation in PHH in vitro.

the combination significantly enhanced CPT1 and ACOX1

rate of alcohol and free fatty acids, and consequently,
an increased formation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [24]. Accordingly, thiobarbituric acid reactive
substance (TBARS) assay revealed a marked increase of
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in PHH stimulated with

In our in vitro model, we observed enhanced phospoIκBα and phospho-p65 levels in alcohol or oleate
stimulated PHH indicative of activation of the NFκB
pathway. Interestingly, phospo-IκBα and phospho-p65
levels were further enhanced by combined stimulation
with both stimuli (Figure 2D). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are two
pro-inflammatory genes which are regulated by NFκB
and which correlate with hepatic inflammation in ALD
and NAFLD [26, 27]. Notably, expression levels of
IL-8 and ICAM-1 corresponded with phospo-IκBα and
phospho-p65 levels in PHH stimulated with alcohol, oleate
or their combination (Figure 2E). These findings indicate
synergistic effects of oleate and alcohol on oxidative stress
and pro-inflammatory gene expression in PHH in vitro.

(Figure 2B). Also the expression of heme oxygenase-1
(HMOX-1) and NADPH oxidase component p47phox
was only significantly enhanced in PHH stimulated with
the alcohol and oleate combination indicating increased
cellular oxidative stress (Figure 2C). Oxidative stress is
a known inducer of the transcription factor NFκB, which
plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of both ALD and
NAFLD [25]. NFκB is held inactive in the cytoplasm
by its inhibitor IκBα, which exerts its inhibitory effect
primarily through the interaction with p65, a subunit of
NFκB complex, while phosphorylation of IκBα leads
to its degradation, and subsequently, NFκB activation.
The transcriptional activity of NFκB is controlled by
phosphorylation of p65 at multiple serine residues.

slightly increased CYP2E1 mRNA and protein expression
but the combination significantly induced CYP2E1 levels
compared to control cells (Figure 3A). Similar results
were observed by measuring the CYP2E1 activity using

To study the role of CYP2E1 in joint effects of
alcohol and oleate, we compared hepatoma HepG2 cells

(C34; not expressing CYP2E1) [30]. In E47 cells but not

metabolism (Figure 3E, 3F and Suppl.Figure S3A, B) and

stronger than effects of alcohol or oleate alone.
To verify the central role of CYP2E1 and ROSformation in our model, HepG2 E47 cells were incubated
with chlormethiazole (CMZ), a CYP2E1 inhibitor, or

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. Both CMZ
and NAC inhibited individual as well as combined effects
of alcohol and oleate on markers of oxidative stress
(Figure 4A and Suppl.Figure S4A) and inflammation
(Figure 4B). Also alcohol and oleate effects on FASN,
SCD-1 and DGAT1/2 expression were almost completely
blunted by CMZ and NAC (Figure 4C and Suppl.Figure
S4B). Furthermore, CMZ and NAC inhibited both
individual alcohol effects and joint alcohol/oleate effects
on CPT-1 expression (Figure 4D) and cellular TG and
MDA levels (Figure 4E, 4F). In contrast, individual effects
of oleate on cellular lipid levels, beta-oxidation and lipid
peroxidation markers were not affected by CMZ or NAC
(Figure 4D-4F). According CMZ and NAC effects were
observed in primary human hepatocytes (Suppl.Figure
S5). Together, these data indicate that CYP2E1 and ROSformation account for the synergistic effects of alcohol and
oleate on cellular lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation
and pro-inflammatory gene expression.

increase of the lysosomal activity. To assess the dynamic
of the autophagic flux, we performed time course
experiments and found that the alcohol/oleate combination
started to induce LC3 II/I ratio after 6h. This increase
became significant after 12h and continued to rise up to
24h (Suppl.Figure S6A). The raise in LC3 II/I ratio was
accompanied with a concomitant reduction in p62 protein
levels (data not shown).
Fitting to this, expression of the critical autophagyrelated genes ATG7 and ATG12 (Figure 5D and Suppl.
Figure S6B) as well as the pro-autophagic kinase vacuolar
protein sorting 34 (VPS34) (Figure 5E) was not or
only slightly increased in PHH after alcohol or oleate
stimulation while alcohol/oleate caused a marked increase.
Very similar effects were observed in CYP2E1 expressing
E47 cells, while neither alcohol or oleate alone nor their
combination significantly affected ATG7, ATG12 or
VPS34 expression in C34 cells lacking CYP2E1 (Figure
5F and Suppl.Figure S6C). Also CMZ and NAC blunted
the joint effect of alcohol and oleate on pro-autophagic
gene expression (Figure 5G and Suppl.Figure S6D).
Together, these findings suggest that joint effects of
alcohol and oleate on CYP2E1 and ROS formation cause
an induction of autophagy.

Effect of alcohol and oleate on the activation of
autophagy
To get further insight into the joint effects of alcohol
and oleate in hepatocytes, we focused on autophagy
which is increasingly recognized as critical factor in the
pathogenesis of both ALD and NAFLD [31, 32]. First, we
investigated the effect of alcohol and oleate on the cleavage
of the microtubule-associated 1 light chain 3 (LC3-I). The
lipidation of LC3-I with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
leads to the formation of LC3-II, which is a critical step in
autophagosome formation and which can be visualized by
western blotting where LC3-II appears as faster migrating
band than LC3-I. Oleate or alcohol alone did not affect
LC3-II levels but the Alc/OL combination significantly
increased LC3-II expression in PHH compared to control
cells (Figure 5A).
The increased LC3-II levels can be associated
with either PE conjugation due to enhanced formation
of autophagosomes or a block of LC3-II degradation
due to impaired maturation of autophagosomes. To
distinguish between these two possibilities, we detected
expression levels of sequestome 1 (p62), a protein that is
degraded by autophagy and accumulates when autophagy
is impaired. As shown in Figure (Figure 5B), alcohol/
oleate combination led to a significant decrease in p62
protein levels, which indicates increased autophagy.
Pre-incubation with chloroquine (CQ) (which raises the
lysosomal pH leading to inhibition of both fusion of
autophagosome with lysosome and lysosomal protein
degradation) caused a time-dependent increase of the
LC3II/LC3I in response to stimulation with the alcohol/
oleate combination in comparison to alcohol or oleate
alone (Figure 5C). This indicates that the combination
is causing an increased autophagic flux rather than an

Role of autophagy in the synergistic effects of
alcohol and oleate on lipid accumulation, lipid
peroxidation and hepatocellular inflammation
To assess the functional role of autophagy in
synergistic alcohol and oleate mediated effects, HepG2
E47 cells were pre-incubated with 3-methyl adenine (3MA), a highly specific inhibitor of VPS34. 3-MA treatment
enhanced basal alcohol- and oleate-induced triglyceride
accumulation (Figure 6A), MDA levels (Figure 6B) and
ICAM-1 expression (Figure 6C). Moreover, 3-MA further
enhanced the effect of the alcohol/oleate combination on
the expression of the pro-inflammatory gene ICAM-1
(Figure 6C). Similarly, chloroquine treatment significantly
aggravated the effects of alcohol and oleate alone as
well as their combination on the expression of oxidative
stress markers and pro-inflammatory genes (Supp.Figure
S8). Conversely, stimulation with the autophagy inducer
rapamycin slightly inhibited alcohol and oleate effects on
these parameters (Figure 6D-6F). Especially, joint effects
of alcohol and oleate on triglyceride, MDA and ICAM1 mRNA levels were completely blocked by rapamycin
(Figure 6D-6F). These findings could be confirmed in
PHH (Suppl.Figure S7A, B). Together, these data indicate
that autophagy inhibits combined alcohol and oleate
mediated effects on hepatocellular lipid-accumulation,
lipid-combustion and pro-inflammatory gene expression.

The role of JNK pathway in the synergistic effects
of alcohol and oleate on autophagy activation

stimulated PHH. Also stimulation with oleate caused
an increase in the expression of both enzymes but this
induction was significantly stronger in combination
with alcohol. Similarly, the induction of triglyceride
synthesis and cellular triglyceride levels were moderate
upon stimulation with alcohol or oleate compared to the
combination of both stimuli. Similar joint effects were
observed on the expression of key enzymes of lipid
oxidation, which are known to cause ROS formation.
Accordingly, also gene expression indicative for oxidative
stress and cellular malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were
markedly increased by alcohol in combination with
oleate stimulation while either of the two stimuli alone
exhibited no or only slight effects. Moreover, we found
that alcohol and oleate combination induced significantly
more pro-inflammatory activity in hepatocytes than either
of the two stimuli alone. Previous studies have found that
effects of free fatty acids on hepatocytes may dependent
on their degree of saturation [42, 43]. In the present study
we mainly applied the unsaturated fatty acid oleate to
induce hepatocellular lipid accumulation because we have
previously shown that the oleate induced in vitro steatosis
causes cellular alterations similar to those found in hepatic
tissue of NAFLD-patients [19, 20]. However, we also
analyzed the combined effects of alcohol and the saturated
fatty acid palmitate on the expression of genes that affect
ß-oxidation, autophagy and inflammation and found
similar effects as observed by alcohol in combination with
oleate (Suppl.Figure S9).
Noteworthy, joint effects of alcohol and oleate on
cellular lipid accumulation and pro-inflammatory gene
expression were dependent on CYP2E1 activity. CYP2E1
activity has been shown to correlate with alcohol-induced
liver injury, and inhibition of CYP2E1 prevented the
induction of hepatic steatosis and ROS production in
models of alcoholic steatohepatitis [23, 41, 44]. Also in
NASH, increased CYP2E1 activity has been described
and has been identified as a pathogenic factor [45-47].
Interestingly, in our in vitro model we found that the
combination of alcohol and oleate induced CYP2E1 levels
and its activity significantly more than each stimulus
alone. Moreover, CYP2E1 inhibition had only slight
effects on hepatocellular lipid accumulation and MDA
formation induced by singly alcohol or oleate stimulation,
respectively. In contrast, joint effects of alcohol and
oleate on hepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation were
completely blunted. These effects indicate a crucial
role of CYP2E1 and subsequent ROS production in the
underlying pathophysiological mechanism of synergistic
effects of alcohol and oleate.
Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular
catabolic pathway for the degradation of long-lived
proteins and cytoplasmic organelles, can either be
increased or decreased by ethanol depending on the used
model, the dose, the evaluated tissue and the experimental
conditions [48] . While the effects of ethanol on autophagy

In search for the mechanism, by which alcohol and
oleate jointly affect autophagy, we analyzed the effects
of these stimuli on the activation of c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) because recent studies found that JNK can
mediate the induction of autophagy in hepatic as well as
non-hepatic cells [33-35]. Moreover, increasing oxidative
stress by alcohol can activate the JNK-signaling pathway
in CYP2E1-dependent manner, and also free fatty acids
have been shown to induce autophagy in hepatocytes via
JNK activation [34, 36, 37]. In our experimental model,
stimulation with alcohol or oleate alone exhibited no or
only slight effects on phopsho-JNK and phospho-c-JUN
protein levels in PHH while the combination caused a
significant increase of JNK and c-JUN phosphorylation
(Figure 7A). Neither alone nor in combination alcohol
and oleate affected the total JNK expression levels (Figure
7A). Pre-incubation with the specific JNK inhibitor
(SB600125) abrogated the alcohol- and oleate-induced
increase of LC3-II levels as well as the reduction in p62
protein levels in hepatocytes (Figure 7B). Moreover, JNK
inhibition blocked the alcohol/oleate-induced ATG7 and
ATG12 up-regulation (Figure 7C, 7D). Together, these
findings indicate that the joint effects of alcohol and
oleate on autophagy in hepatocytes are induced via JNKactivation.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed a new in vitro model
to study the effects of moderate, non-toxic alcohol levels
on lipid-loaded and control hepatocytes and unraveled
interacting, synergistic effects between hepatocellular lipid
accumulation and alcohol metabolism.
Circulating free fatty acids (FFA) are also the
major mediators of excessive hepatic lipid accumulation
in patients with NAFLD. The rate of hepatic FFA uptake
is not regulated, and therefore, is proportional to plasma
FFA concentrations [38]. In NAFLD patients, circulating
FFA are commonly elevated, and their plasma levels
correlate with disease severity [39]. Already previously,
we had established an in vitro model of cellular lipid
accumulation in PHH and HepG2 cells and confirmed
that the pathological mechanisms observed in this model
system closely mimic the pathological alterations found in
hepatic tissue of NAFLD-patients [19, 20, 40].
In the present study, we combined this model with
alcohol stimulation. Also alcohol is known to induce
hepatocellular lipid accumulation in vitro and in vivo
[23, 41]. Alcohol oxidation leads to acetyl-CoA synthesis
from acetate or citrate that constitutes the substrates
for lipogenic enzymes, and accordingly, we observed
an increased expression of FASN and SCD1 in alcohol

are complex and require further study, it is becoming
clear that autophagy serves a protective function against
ethanol-induced liver injury [31]. Moreover, induction of
autophagy has been shown to alleviated hepatic steatosis
and injury in models of acute and chronic ethanol exposure
[23, 31, 36, 49]. Of note, ethanol-induced autophagy
requires its metabolism via CYP2E1 and subsequent ROS
production [23, 36, 50]. Moreover, blocking CYP2E1 or
inhibiting ROS by antioxidants also diminished GFPLC3 puncta [23, 36, 50]. It seems that alcohol oxidation
by CYP2E1 is also important for alcohol-induced
inhibition of cellular proteasome activity and increased
autophagosome numbers [51].
In our in vitro model, which mimics moderate
alcohol exposure and FFA-induced steatosis, neither
alcohol nor oleate alone caused a significant induction of
autophagy markers in hepatocytes. In contrast, the alcohol/
oleate combination led to a marked up-regulation of the
autophagic flux, and we revealed that this synergistic effect
on autophagy was mediated via JNK-activation. Inhibition
of autophagy induced lipid accumulation, oxidative
stress and inflammation, while induction of autophagy
alleviated these mechanisms. Still, it appears that under
the experimental conditions used, autophagy could not
counterbalance the negative effects in this in vitro model.
One may speculate that also in vivo there is a fine balance
between protective and damaging mechanisms. Only
slight differences in the ratio of individual beneficial and
detrimental factors may decide whether moderate alcohol
consumption is protective or is causing harm in (nonalcoholic) fatty livers. Actually, there are some studies
assuming that moderate alcohol consumption might
even be protective for patients with NAFLD [52, 53]. It
is intriguing to speculate whether intensified effects of
alcohol on autophagy in steatotic hepatocytes may (in
part) account for such observations.
Of note, the joint effect of alcohol and cellular
steatosis on autophagy required CYP2E1 activity in
our in vitro model. Generally, this cytochrome P450 is
known for its detrimental effects in alcoholic liver disease
through free radical formation and lipid peroxidation [23,
54]. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of CYP2E1
has emerged as strategy for treatment of alcohol-induced
liver injury [54, 55]. Also in our in vitro system, CYP2E1
accounts for detrimental effects of alcohol in lipid loaded
hepatocytes, and certainly, the clinical relevancy of our
in vitro findings has to be verified. Still, the CYP2E1
mediated joint effect of alcohol- and oleate-induced
steatosis on autophagy indicate that the manipulation of
CYP2E1 may be a double-edged sword and warrant the
exercise of caution in the pharmacological use of CYP2E1
inhibitors for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease in
obese individuals. Furthermore, one may speculate
whether individual factors tipping the balance on the one
or the other side of detrimental or beneficial joint effects
of alcohol and free fatty acids account at least in part for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the high variation in the clinical course of alcoholic liver
disease.
In summary, in our in vitro model, exposure
of hepatocytes to alcohol and the fatty acid oleate
caused a synergistic effect on lipid accumulation, lipid
peroxidation, oxidative stress and inflammatory gene
expression. Conversely, alcohol and oleate jointly induced
autophagy which reduced these pathological mechanisms.
Noteworthy, both detrimental as well as beneficial joint
effect of alcohol and FFA were dependent on CYP2E1
activity. Upon clinical verification these in vitro findings
may have important implications on the prognosis or
treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture model
Isolation and culture of primary human hepatocytes
(PHH) were performed as described [56]. Human liver
tissue for cell isolation was obtained from the charitable
state controlled foundation HTCR, with informed patient
consent and approved by the local Ethics Committee.
HepG2 E47 cells which express CYP2E1 and
HepG2 C34 cells which do not express CYP2E1 were
cultured as described [30].
PHH or HepG2 cells were incubated with oleate
(Ol) (doses up to 0.2 mM) for 24 h as described [20].
We have previously shown that this treatment leads to
cellular steatosis and pathological alterations similar to
those found in hepatic tissue of NAFLD-patients [19, 20,
40]. Subsequently, cells were co-incubated with clinically
relevant non-toxic concentration of alcohol (Alc) (up to
50 mM) [21-23] for 16-24 h. In additional experimental
conditions, cells were treated with 3-methyl adenine (3MA; 2.5 mM), rapamycin (0.2 µg/ml), chlormethiazole
(CMZ; 100 µM), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 0.2 mM), JNK
inhibitor (SB600125; 10 µM) or chloroquine (CQ; 10 µM)
for 1 h before adding alcohol to the cell cultured medium.
All experiments have been repeated at least three times.

Mitochondrial activity assay
For quantification of hepatocellular mitochondrial
activity, the colorimetric XTT assay (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Analysis of CYP2E1 activity
Hepatocytes were washed twice, incubated with 0.2
mM p-nitrophenol at 37°C for 2h, and then the reaction
was terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final
41475

Oncotarget

concentration of 1% (v/v). Cells were harvested and
centrifuged at 5,000g for 5 min, and the supernatants were
assayed for 4-nitrocatechol by adding NaOH to a final
concentration of (1N) and immediately determining the
absorbance at 492 nm.

Analysis of cellular lipid content
Cellular lipid droplets were visualized by Oil Red
O staining as described [20]. Lipid droplets were assessed
using a light microscope with digitalized camera and
a Metaview image analysis system (Olympus America
Inc., PA). The density of lipid droplets per microscopic
area was calculated from four different fields. Total
cellular triglycerides were extracted and quantified by the
triglyceride determination kit (GPO) (Sigma, Deisenhofen,
Germany) as described [20].
