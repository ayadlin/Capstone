Abstract

Author Manuscript

Two decades of studies in multiple model organisms have established the Hippo pathway as a key
regulator of organ size and tissue homeostasis. By inhibiting YAP and TAZ transcription coactivators, the Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stemness in response to a
wide range of extracellular and intracellular signals, including cell-cell contact, cell polarity,
mechanical cues, ligands of G-protein coupled receptors, and cellular energy status. Dysregulation
of the Hippo pathway exerts a significant impact on cancer development. Further investigation of
the functions and regulatory mechanisms of this pathway will help uncovering the mystery of
organ size control and identify new targets for cancer treatment.
The emergence of multicellular organisms is an evolutionary milestone. Among the most
fundamental mechanisms supporting multicellularity, are those that ensure the proper size
and shape of tissues and organs to meet the need of functionality. However, despite
intensive investigations into the underlying principles behind a “preset” size of organs, we
are far from having a clear picture to this basic question in developmental biology.
Nevertheless, investigations of the Hippo pathway on organ size control have shed light into
this mystery (Halder and Johnson, 2011; Pan, 2010; Yu and Guan, 2013).

In 1995, two studies in Drosophila discovered that deletion of Warts (Wts) gene resulted in
dramatic overgrowth of multiple tissues (Justice et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1995). Several years
later, a flurry of studies showed that Salvador (Sav) (Kango-Singh et al., 2002; Tapon et al.,
2002), Hippo (hpo) (Harvey et al., 2003; Jia et al., 2003; Pantalacci et al., 2003; Udan et al.,
2003; Wu et al., 2003), and Mob as tumor suppressor (Mats) (Lai et al., 2005) mutant

Mats interact genetically and physically, and the remarkable organ size phenotype elicited
by their mutation is unprecedented in other established developmental pathways, thus they
were grouped into a new signaling module — the Hippo pathway — named after the
enormous size of Hpo mutant organs which resemble that of a hippopotamus. Yorkie (yki),
the key functional effector of the Hippo pathway in organ size regulation, was soon
discovered in a screen for Wts-interacting proteins (Huang et al., 2005).

The Hippo pathway is highly conserved in mammals. The mammalian orthologs of Hpo,
Sav, Wts, Mats, and Yki are Mammalian sterile 20-like 1 /2 (MST1/2, also called STK4/3),
Salvador (SAV1), Large tumor suppressor homolog 1/2 (LATS1/2), MOB kinase activator
1A/B (MOB1a/b), and Yes-associated protein (YAP) / Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ
binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR1), respectively (Halder and Johnson, 2011; Pan,
2010; Yu and Guan, 2013) (Table 1). The Hippo pathway quickly attracted broad attention
due to its remarkable potency in regulating organ size, as well as its apparent relevance to
tissue regeneration and cancer. Here, with an emphasis on recent developments, we review
the current understanding of the organization, regulation, and function of the Hippo pathway
and discuss some key open questions.

YAP/TAZ and Yki as Major Effectors of Hippo Signaling
In Drosophila, deleting Yki suppresses the overgrowth phenotypes of Hpo, Sav, or Wts
mutants (Huang et al., 2005). In mice, deleting YAP also diminishes the overgrowth
phenotypes caused by deficiency of MST1/2 or other upstream regulators (Zhang et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2011). Thus, Yki and YAP/TAZ are the evolutionarily-conserved key
effectors of the Hippo pathway.

Yki and YAP/TAZ are believed to mediate the biological functions of the Hippo pathway by
regulating gene transcription. As transcriptional co-activators, Yki and YAP/TAZ cannot
bind DNA directly, and they must interact with DNA-binding transcription factors to
regulate target gene expression. In Drosophila, Scalloped (Sd) is a transcription factor and
key partner of Yki which mediates the function of Yki in tissue growth (Goulev et al., 2008;
Wu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2008). Similarly, in mammalian cells, the
TEAD family transcription factors (TEAD1-4, orthologs of Sd) are key partners for YAP
(Zhao et al., 2008). Several lines of evidence indicate that TEADs are the major partners of
YAP in transcriptional regulation. For instance, a TEAD-binding deficient YAP mutant lost
its ability to induce transcription of known YAP target genes (Zhao et al., 2008), and knockin of the TEAD-binding deficient YAP (Y94A mutant) phenotypically mimics YAP
knockout in the skin and heart (Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; von Gise et al., 2012). In
addition, the majority of YAP and TEAD occupied sites in the genome are shared (Stein et
al., 2015; Zanconato et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2008), and when TEAD is fused with a VP16
transactivation domain, it produces a gene expression profile similar to that induced by
active YAP (Ota and Sasaki, 2008). TEAD1-4 or Sd can bind to a consensus motif similar to
the GTIIC sequence (TGGAATGT or ACATTCCA), and transcription reporters under
control of GTIIC concatemers are now widely used to measure Hippo pathway activity
(Dupont et al., 2011; Mohseni et al., 2014; Ota and Sasaki, 2008). Besides TEAD1-4,
YAP/TAZ have also been shown to interact with other transcription factors including Smad,

RUNX1/2, p63/p73, and ErbB4 (reviewed in (Varelas, 2014)), although the functional
significance of these transcription factors in Hippo pathway is less clear.

Author Manuscript

A strong transcriptional activation domain is present in YAP/TAZ, but absent in Yki.
Nevertheless, human YAP can rescue the lethality resulting from Hippo pathway
hyperactivation in Drosophila, indicating a functional conservation (Huang et al., 2005).
Genome-wide assessment of chromatin binding status reveals that, in addition to occupancy
at proximal promoters of target genes, YAP and TEAD largely exert their transcriptional
activity by interacting with distal enhancers, suggesting that YAP, and probably TAZ and
Yki, may regulate transcription via multiple mechanisms including recruitment of general
transcription factors, modification of epigenetic markers, and modulation of chromatin
structure (Lian et al., 2010; Stein et al., 2015; Zanconato et al., 2015) (Figure 1). Indeed,
recent evidence shows that Yki can interact with the Brahma complex, GAGA factors,
nuclear receptor coactivator 6 (NCoA6, a subunit of the Trithorax-related histone
methyltransferase), and the Mediator complex (Jin et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2013; Qing et al.,
2014), and TAZ can interact with the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF (Skibinski
et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

The transcriptional activity of Yki and YAP/TAZ is regulated in the nucleus by Tondudomain-containing growth inhibitor (Tgi) and Vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4, an
ortholog of Tgi). Tgi can directly compete with Yki for Sd binding, resulting in inhibition of
Yki-regulated transcription (Guo et al., 2013; Koontz et al., 2013). When Hippo signaling is
on, Tgi and Sd form a complex, leading to transcriptional repression; on the contrary, when
Hippo signaling is off, Yki enters the nucleus and displaces Tgi from Sd, leading to
expression of Yki target genes and tissue growth (Koontz et al., 2013). In mammals, VGLL4
similarly competes with YAP/TAZ for TEAD binding (Jiao et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2014b) (Figure 1). However, whether YAP/TAZ functions simply by relieving a default
repression of TEAD by VGLL4 has not been demonstrated. Interestingly, the expression of
VGLL4 appears to be repressed by miR-130a—a microRNA (miRNA) that is directly
induced by YAP, leading to amplification of YAP activity (Shen et al., 2015). A similar
mechanism is also present in Drosophila, in which Bantam—a well-known Yki-induced
miRNA (Nolo et al., 2006; Thompson and Cohen, 2006), can repress expression of Tgi
(Shen et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

Although their role as transcriptional co-activators is widely appreciated, YAP/TAZ and Yki
may also repress expression of certain genes when bound to specific factors. For instance,
YAP/TAZ can interact with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD)
complex, resulting in transcriptional repression (Kim et al., 2015). Moreover, YAP has been
identified as a regulator for global miRNA biogenesis via modulation of miRNA processing
enzymes Microprocessor or Dicer complex, suggesting a transcription-independent role for
YAP (Chaulk et al., 2014; Mori et al., 2014). Hence YAP/TAZ and Yki may regulate gene
expression via multiple mechanisms.
Gene expression signatures under YAP/TAZ and Yki hyperactivation (or ectopic
expression) in Drosophila and different mammalian cell types have been profiled by
independent studies. However, the overlap between these different gene profiling studies is

not high, suggesting that YAP/TAZ and Yki may regulate target gene expression in a tissue
or cell type-specific manner. In Drosophila, some common Yki target genes are Bantam,
Diap1 and cyclin E, which may mediate the effect of Yki in inhibiting cell death and
promoting cell proliferation (Huang et al., 2005; Nolo et al., 2006; Tapon et al., 2002;
Thompson and Cohen, 2006). In mammals, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a
commonly used marker of YAP activation (Zhao et al., 2008), and many genes involved in
cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell migration have also been identified as YAP targets
(Stein et al., 2015). It is likely that a panel of genes work together to exert biological
functions of YAP/TAZ.

MST1/2 and LATS1/2 Kinases Restrict YAP Activity

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In the Hippo pathway, LATS1/2 directly phosphorylate and inhibit YAP/TAZ. Interestingly,
YAP has five LATS1/2 target consensus motifs (HXRXXS), four of which are conserved in
TAZ (Zhao et al., 2010). Phosphorylation of YAP on serine 127 (S127) generates a 14-3-3
binding site, and binding with 14-3-3 sequesters YAP in the cytoplasm (Dong et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2007). In addition, phosphorylation of YAP on serine 381 (S381) triggers a
subsequent phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 (CK1δ/ε) and activation of a phosphodegron,
resulting in recruitment of SCFbeta-TRCP E3 ligase, ubiquitination, and proteasomal
degradation of YAP (Zhao et al., 2010). Thus, through regulating both YAP subcellular
localization and protein stability, LATS1/2 ensures a spatial and temporal control of YAP
activity (Figure 1). TAZ is regulated by LATS1/2 in a similar fashion, although degradation
plays a more prominent role in TAZ regulation possibly due to an additional phosphodegron
at its N-terminus (Lei et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010a). The subcellular localization of Yki is
regulated similarly by Wts phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. However, the
phosphodegron and the phosphorylation-mediated degradation mechanisms are not
conserved in Yki (Huang et al., 2005; Oh and Irvine, 2008). In addition, YAP and Yki have
also been shown to be degraded via the autolysosomal pathway (Kwon et al., 2013; Liang et
al., 2014), suggesting a potential role of YAP and Yki in vesicular membrane dynamics and
related cellular processes such as autophagy.

Author Manuscript

LATS1/2 are activated by MST1/2 through several mechanisms. MST1/2 phosphorylate
LATS1/2 at the C-terminal hydrophobic motif, which promotes LATS1/2
autophosphorylation at its activation loop. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MOB1 by
MST1/2 enhances MOB1 interaction with the autoinhibitory domain of LATS1/2, leading to
full activation of LATS1/2 (Callus et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2005; Praskova et al., 2004; Wu
et al., 2003). In addition, SAV1 is also phosphorylated by MST1/2, and SAV1 functions as a
partner of MST1/2 in promoting LATS1/2 phosphorylation (Callus et al., 2006; Tapon et al.,
2002) (Figure 1). In Drosophila, Wts is regulated by Hpo, Sav, and Mats by a similar
mechanism (Wehr et al., 2013).
Merlin (Mer), Expanded (Ex), and Kibra, three cell cortex-localized and cytoskeletoninteracting proteins, may function as a scaffold for core Hippo components at the apical
domain for activation, as Sav, Hpo, and Wts have been shown to physically interact with
Ex/Mer/Kibra (Baumgartner et al., 2010; Genevet et al., 2010; Hamaratoglu et al., 2006; Yu
et al., 2010) (Table 1). In addition, the effect of Ex/Mer/Kibra on the Hippo pathway may be

mediated by Tao kinase 1 (Tao-1), which can directly phosphorylate and activate Hpo
(Boggiano et al., 2011; Poon et al., 2011). In mammalian cells, Neurofibromin 2 (NF2, Mer
ortholog) appears to play a more direct role in regulating LATS1/2 activity: it can directly
interact with LATS1/2 and recruit LATS1/2 to the plasma membrane for activation by
MST1/2 (Yin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010) (Figures 2 and 3).

Author Manuscript

The Drosophila Hpo or MST1/2 are not absolutely required for regulation of Wts or
LATS1/2. It has been observed that in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, MST1/2
double knockout did not abolish YAP phosphorylation, suggesting the existence of
additional Hippo-like activity (Zhou et al., 2009). Indeed, a recent study in Drosophila has
identified Misshapen (Msn) as another kinase responsible for Wts activation. This
mechanism is also conserved in mammals, as MAP4K4 (Msn ortholog) overexpression
promotes phosphorylation of LATS1/2 (Li et al., 2014), and MAP4K4 knockdown induces
activity of a YAP reporter (Mohseni et al., 2014). It is possible that additional kinases,
especially some STE20 family members, may activate LATS1/2 in response to different
upstream signals or in different tissue contexts (Figures 2 and 3).
YAP/TAZ have also been shown to be phosphorylated by many other kinases such as
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), homeodomain interacting
protein kinases (HIPK), ABL, and Src family tyrosine kinases (reviewed in (Varelas, 2014)),
suggesting that YAP/TAZ can be regulated by mechanisms independent of Hippo pathway
kinases.

Cell Polarity and Cell Adhesion Regulate Hippo Signaling
Author Manuscript

In searching for upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway, many proteins involved in cell
polarity and cell adhesion have been identified. Echinoid (Ed), a cell adhesion molecule in
Drosophila, can interact with and stabilize Sav, and leads to activation of Hpo (Yue et al.,
2012). In mammalian cells, several proteins at adherens and tight junctions, such as
Angiomotin (AMOT), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14), and αCatenin can sequester YAP/TAZ at cell junctions (reviewed in (Yu and Guan, 2013)).
Therefore cell adhesion and formation of intercellular junctions serve as a mechanism to
repress YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity (Figures 2 and 3).

Author Manuscript

Crumbs (Crb), a component of apical-basal polarity, interacts with Ex which is critical for
the apical localization of Ex/Mer/Kibra complex (Chen et al., 2010; Ling et al., 2010;
Robinson et al., 2010). In addition, Scribble (SCRIB) interacts with both MST1/2 and
LATS1/2, thus promoting LATS1/2 activation (Cordenonsi et al., 2011; Mohseni et al.,
2014). Fat, a protocadherin which plays a key role in planar cell polarity, also activates the
Hippo pathway, possibly through regulating Ex protein levels and localization (Bennett and
Harvey, 2006; Silva et al., 2006; Tyler and Baker, 2007; Willecke et al., 2006) (Figure 2).
However, mammalian Fat orthologs do not seem to be major regulators of the Hippo
pathway (Sharma and McNeill, 2013). It is noteworthy that the link between cell polarity
and the Hippo pathway may be indirect, and some proteins, such as Fat, may regulate cell
polarity and Hippo signaling via different mechanisms (Matakatsu and Blair, 2012).

Cell Contact and Mechanical Cues Regulate Hippo Signaling
Cells in solid tissues communicate with neighboring cells and their extracellular matrix, and
perceive constant physical signals from their local environment. Cell-cell contact was
discovered as the first signal regulating the Hippo pathway (Zhao et al., 2007). In a sparse
culture, YAP and TAZ are primarily localized in the nucleus to promote target gene
transcription and cell proliferation. On the contrary, at high cell density, YAP and TAZ are
primarily cytoplasmic, corresponding to growth inhibition. It is known that a cell ceases to
proliferate following physical contact with surrounding cells, and loss of cell contact
inhibition is an indicator of oncogenic transformation. Thus, regulation of YAP/TAZ by cell
density suggests a critical role for the Hippo pathway in contact inhibition, tissue growth,
and tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Mechanical cues, such as ECM stiffness and cell geometry, are also potent regulators of
YAP/TAZ (Dupont et al., 2011) (Figure 3). When cells are grown on a stiff matrix or are
spread across a large surface, YAP and TAZ are activated. In contrast, when cells are seeded
on a soft matrix or are compressed into a small area, YAP and TAZ are inactivated. ECM
stiffness and cell geometry are important for cell proliferation and differentiation, and YAP/
TAZ activity plays a role in these cellular processes. Cell geometry has also been proposed
as a mechanism underlying Hippo pathway regulation by cell density: at low density, cells
are flat and spread, leading to YAP activation; whereas at high density, cells adopt a round
and compact geometry, resulting in YAP inactivation (Aragona et al., 2013; Wada et al.,
2011). Further support for a role of YAP/TAZ in mechanosensing, mechanical strain and
shear stress have been shown to stimulate YAP/TAZ, and YAP activation is required for
mechanical strain-induced cell cycle reentry (Benham-Pyle et al., 2015; Codelia et al., 2014;
Kim et al., 2014), and YAP also mediates changes in three dimensional body shape in
response to tissue tension (Porazinski et al., 2015).
The attachment of cells to the ECM is an important mechanism for maintaining cell survival,
and cells normally undergo anoikis when detached from the ECM. The attachment status of
a cell to its ECM can also regulate Hippo pathway activity. YAP is activated during the
process of cell attachment but inactivated when cells are detached (Zhao et al., 2012).
Expression of constitutively active YAP promotes survival of detached cells, suggesting that
cancer cells with high YAP activity may escape anoikis and undergo metastasis. In support
of this notion, LATS1/2 expression was found to be selectively reduced in metastatic but not
primary prostate tumors (Zhao et al., 2012).

Soluble Factors Regulate Hippo Signaling
Author Manuscript

The primary function of YAP/TAZ is to promote growth, and many mitogenic hormones
and growth factors act through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) to induce cell
proliferation (Figure 3). GPCR ligands signal through Gα12/13 or Gαq/11, such as
lysophosphatidic acid, thrombin, angiotensin II, and estrogen, can activate YAP/TAZ; in
contrast, ligands signal through Gαs and protein kinase A (PKA), such as epinephrine and
glucagon, can repress YAP/TAZ activity (Kim et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2012; Mo et al.,
2012; Wennmann et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2013a; Yu et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015).

Interestingly, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by Gαq/11 can either activate or inhibit
YAP, with conventional PKC activating YAP and novel PKC inhibiting YAP (Gong et al.,
2015). The remarkable differential functions of PKC in YAP regulation provide a
mechanism to explain some of the cell type-specific responses to PKC activation. GPCR is
the largest family of membrane receptors mediating diverse physiological or pathological
responses. The demonstration of Hippo regulation by GPCRs links the Hippo pathway to a
wide range of upstream signals and biological functions.

Author Manuscript

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a key signaling cascade in development and carcinogenesis.
A destruction complex including Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and glycogen
synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) causes constant degradation of β-catenin. Wnt stimulation
disrupts the destruction complex and leads to accumulation of β-catenin. Interestingly,
recent studies suggest that YAP/TAZ are also activated by diverse Wnt family ligands.
YAP/TAZ have been shown to be components of the destruction complex, and are regulated
by Wnt in a fashion similar to that of β-catenin (Azzolin et al., 2014; Azzolin et al., 2012).
However, a recent study suggests that Wnt activates YAP/TAZ via Frizzled (a GPCR-like
Wnt receptor), Gα12/13, Rho GTPases, and LATS1/2 (Park et al., 2015). In addition, APC
has been shown to act as a scaffold protein for SAV1 and LATS1, and Apc deletion lead to
YAP activation and tumorigenesis (Cai et al., 2015). More studies may be needed to verify
the mechanism of YAP/TAZ activation by Wnt.

Author Manuscript

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin have also been shown to regulate YAP/Yki
activity in cultured mammalian cells and Drosophila, and these signals are mediated by the
Ras-Raf-MAPK signaling cascade or phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1) (Fan et al.,
2013; Reddy and Irvine, 2013; Strassburger et al., 2012). TAZ is also stabilized upon PI3K
activation, which is mediated by direct phosphorylation by GSK3 (Huang et al., 2012).
However, no significant effect of EGF and IGF on YAP was observed in several other
studies, and YAP activity appeared to be normal in the presence of inhibitors of PI3K or
AKT, or in PDK1 null embryonic cells (Yu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2007). These
discrepancies could be due to differences in experimental settings or cell types, and should
be clarified by future studies.

Effect of Cellular Metabolic Status on Hippo Signaling

Author Manuscript

Recently, a link between cellular metabolic status and the Hippo pathway has been reported
(Figure 3). Under energy deprivation, such as glucose starvation, the AMPK activated
protein kinase (AMPK) can directly phosphorylate YAP at serine 61 (S61) and serine 94
(S94) (Mo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Phosphorylation of YAP S94 abolishes the
interaction between YAP and TEADs, leading to inhibition of YAP activity. In addition,
energy stress also inhibits YAP by increasing kinase activity of LATS1/2, either in an
AMPK-dependent or -independent manner (Mo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). AMPK can
phosphorylate AMOTL1, which in turn facilitates YAP phosphorylation by LATS1/2
(DeRan et al., 2014). A similar mechanism is also present in Drosophila, in which Ampk
inactivates Yki and affects cell proliferation in the larval central brain and central nerve cord
(Gailite et al., 2015). It appears that during energy stress, both AMPK and LATS1/2 are
unleashed to restrict YAP activity. These findings also suggest that the Hippo pathway may

mediate the anticancer effect of metformin, which is known to activate AMPK (DeRan et
al., 2014; Mo et al., 2015). Other than AMPK, glucose may also promote YAP/TAZ activity
through phosphofructokinase, which stimulates the interaction between YAP/TAZ and
TEADs (Enzo et al., 2015).
YAP/TAZ activity has also been linked to oxygen availability. Under hypoxic conditions,
the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) stimulates expression of SIAH1/2, two E3 ubiquitin
ligases. SIAH1/2 then promote ubiquitination and degradation of LATS2, leading to
YAP/TAZ activation (Ma et al., 2015; Xiang et al., 2014) (Figure 3). In addition, HIF1
directly induces transcription of TAZ (Xiang et al., 2014), and YAP interacts with and
stabilizes HIF1 to enhance transcription of HIF1 target genes (Ma et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

YAP/TAZ are potent stimulators of cell growth and proliferation, which are energyconsuming processes. The regulation of Hippo signaling by AMPK suggests that metabolic
status can function as a checkpoint for growth–promoting activity of YAP/TAZ. Under
conditions of nutrient deprivation or energy crisis, YAP/TAZ activity needs to be restricted
to prevent energy exhaustion caused by anabolic processes. Oxygen also plays a critical role
in cellular metabolism, and hypoxia is involved in different pathological processes such as
cancer. The link between hypoxia and YAP/TAZ activity indicates a role of YAP/TAZ in
mediating oncogenic effect of hypoxia.

Actin Cytoskeleton Integrates Upstream Signals

Author Manuscript

The actin cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases are not only important in maintaining cell
morphology, but also play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation
(Jaffe and Hall, 2005). Manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as overexpression of
Rho GTPases or inhibition of Rho by C3 toxin, dramatically modulates YAP/TAZ activity
(Dupont et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). Rho GTPases and changes in actin
cytoskeleton dynamics have been demonstrated to be key mediators of mechanical cues,
GPCR ligands, and cell attachment in regulating the Hippo pathway (Figure 3).
Consistently, deletion of different regulators of the actin cytoskeleton impacts YAP and Yki
activity. For instance, loss of actin-capping proteins or the Capulet gene (inhibits actin
polymerization) in Drosophila results in Yki activation and tissue overgrowth (Fernandez et
al., 2011; Sansores-Garcia et al., 2011). Similarly, knockdown of actin-capping proteins or
filamentous actin (F-actin) severing proteins (cofilin or gelsolin) in mammalian cells also
leads to YAP activation (Aragona et al., 2013). In general, Rho GTPase activity and F-actin
appear to activate YAP/TAZ, whereas destabilization of F-actin inhibits YAP/TAZ (Dupont
et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012; Wada et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012).

Spectrin proteins, in association with short actin filaments, are organized into an elastic
polygonal meshwork which lines the intracellular side of the plasma membrane. In epithelial
cells, localization of the spectrin network is usually polarized and present in both apical and
basolateral domains. In addition to a supporting role for cell structure, the spectrin network
may transmit diverse signals from cell microenvironment to regulate cellular functions
(Bennett and Gilligan, 1993). Recently, three independent studies revealed a regulatory role
of the spectrin network on the Hippo pathway, and disruption of the spectrin network in

multiple Drosophila tissues leads to activation of Yki and tissue outgrowth, and a similar
phenomenon is also observed in mammalian cells (Deng et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2015;
Wong et al., 2015) (Figures 2 and 3). Therefore, spectrins or associated actin filaments may
function as a major node for integrating upstream signals, such as mechanical cues.

Author Manuscript

Despite its apparent importance, it remains unclear how the actin cytoskeleton regulates
activity of Hippo pathway core kinases. One possibility is that multiple Hippo pathway
components are enriched at the apical domain via an actin-mediated mechanism which
facilitates signal transduction, and actin remodeling may reinforce or disrupt the clustering
of Hippo pathway components. In another scenario, the Hippo pathway could be regulated
by contractile actomyosin and cellular tension (Figure 3). Inhibition of tension-related
enzymes, such as non-muscle myosin (by Blebbistatin), Rho kinases (ROCK, by Y27632),
and myosin light chain kinase (by ML-7) results in YAP/TAZ inhibition (Dupont et al.,
2011; Wada et al., 2011). However, how tension is sensed by the Hippo pathway kinases is
not fully understood. Treating cells with small molecules to inhibit cellular tension may also
affect actin dynamics, so it is difficult to separate the effects of actin remodeling and tension
generated by actomyosin. However, it has been proposed that in Drosophila, Ajuba (Jub)
plays a critical role in tension-induced Yki regulation. In response to high tension, Jub
recruits Wts to intercellular junctions via interactions with α-catenin, thereby inhibiting Wts
activity (Rauskolb et al., 2014). In addition, JNK activation upon mechanical strain has also
been shown to repress LATS1 (Codelia et al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

Although it has been initially reported that YAP regulation by mechanical signals is
independent of LATS1/2, recent studies suggest that LATS1/2 are involved in YAP/TAZ
regulation by the actin cytoskeleton (Miller et al., 2012; Wada et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2007). This discrepancy may be due to incomplete LATS1/2
depletion in knockdown experiments reported in earlier studies. Supporting a role for
LATS1/2, the phosphorylation status and in vitro kinase activity of LATS1/2 are clearly
regulated upon actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and the kinetics are similar to that of
YAP/TAZ phosphorylation (Yu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). The regulation of
Yki/YAP/TAZ by spectrins or cell attachment/detachment has been shown dependent on
Wts and LATS1/2 (Deng et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2012). Moreover,
during the preimplantation stage of mouse embryo development, LATS1/2 are essential for
YAP regulation by small molecules targeting the actin cytoskeleton (Kono et al., 2014).
Collectively, mechanical signals most likely act through Wts and LATS1/2 to influence the
activity and function of Yki and YAP/TAZ.

Negative Feedback Regulation and Crosstalk
Author Manuscript

High Yki or YAP/TAZ activity, especially over long-term, results in tissue overgrowth or
cancer (see below). Thus the physiological fluctuation of Hippo signaling must be tightly
controlled to avoid detrimental effects. In Drosophila, regulation of the Hippo pathway is
fine-tuned by a built-in negative feedback loop in which activation of Yki turns on the
expression of upstream reglators including Four-jointed, Ex, Mer, Kibra, and Wts (Cho et
al., 2006; Genevet et al., 2010; Hamaratoglu et al., 2006; Jukam et al., 2013). Consistently, a
similar negative feedback mechanism also exists in mammalian cells. YAP/TAZ directly

induce the transcription of NF2, LATS2, and probably MST1, leading to LATS1/2 activation
and YAP/TAZ inhibition (Chen et al., 2015b; Dai et al., 2015; Moroishi et al., 2015b). In
addition, YAP/TAZ induce expression of angiomotin-like protein 2 (AMOTL2), a negative
regulator of YAP (Mohseni et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2008). This negative feedback loop is
critical for maintaining the proper transient activation of YAP/TAZ upon stimulation. By
these mechanisms, YAP and TAZ antagonize each other and may provide a buffer for
fluctuations in Hippo pathway activity to ensure tissue homeostasis. When this negative
feedback is disrupted, dysregulation of the Hippo pathway may lead to tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

Elucidating the Hippo pathway regulation and function is complicated by crosstalk between
the Hippo pathway and many other developmental signaling pathways (reviewed in
(Varelas, 2014)). Besides Wnt, YAP/TAZ may also be regulated by sonic hedgehog (SHH)
signaling (Fernandez et al., 2009). On the other hand, YAP/TAZ has been shown to regulate
the expression of ligands for Wnt, Shh, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), JAKSTAT, EGFR, and Notch pathways (reviewed in (Yu et al., 2015)). The extensive signaling
crosstalk may create a microenvironment rich in different factors, which in turn regulates
cell fate through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms in both cell autonomous and nonautonomous manners.

Hippo Pathway in Early Embryonic Development
YAP/TAZ are critical during early embryonic development. Although TAZ knockout mice
are viable, YAP knockout mice die at E8.5, and blastomeres stop dividing before the morula
(16-32 cells) stage when YAP and TAZ are both deleted (Hossain et al., 2007; Makita et al.,
2008; Morin-Kensicki et al., 2006; Nishioka et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2007). Therefore, the
role of YAP and TAZ in early development is partially overlapping.

The first cell-fate specification during embryogenesis occurs during preimplantation stage,
in which the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) are formed. The TE consists of
the outer cells of the blastocyst and forms extraembryonic tissues, while the ICM contains
the inner cells of the blastocyst and give rise to the embryo proper and other tissues. The
formation of the TE and ICM is mainly due to the position or polarity of cells in the morula,
in which the inner and apolar cells form the ICM, while the outer and polar cells give rise to
the TE (Sasaki, 2015). As early as the 16-cell stage, YAP/TAZ already show differential
subcellular localization between inner and outer cells, and this difference lasts to the
blastocyst stage. The different distribution of YAP/TAZ in the TE and ICM results in
different gene expression signatures, especially the induction of TE-specific genes, such as
Cdx2 in outer cells, thus directing cell fate specification (Nishioka et al., 2009). Indeed,
mouse embryos with TEAD4 knockout failed to develop TE cells, with all cells
transforming into ICM. On the other hand, depleting LATS1/2, NF2, or AMOT/AMOTL2
turns all cells into TE linage, and these embryos failed to develop ICM-derived tissues
(Cockburn et al., 2013; Hirate et al., 2013; Lorthongpanich et al., 2013). These results
suggest that the Hippo pathway plays a key role in early embryonic cell specification.

Hippo Signaling in Organ Size Control and Tissue Homeostasis
The effect on organ size is the best-known physiological function of the Hippo pathway. In
Drosophila, mutation of Hippo pathway kinases (Hpo and Wts) or upstream regulators (Ex,
Mer, Kibra, Ft, etc.) leads to overgrowth of organs such as eyes, wings, or other
appendages, and transgenic expression of Yki results in a similar phenotype (reviewed in
(Halder and Johnson, 2011; Pan, 2010)). The increased tissue/organ size is mainly due to
Yki-induced cell proliferation and survival.

Author Manuscript

The effect of the Hippo pathway on organ size is highly conserved in mammals as revealed
by many studies performed in mice (summarized in Table 2). For instance, liver specific
transgenic Yap expression in mice can produce a dramatically enlarged liver. Remarkably,
the liver returns to its normal size via apoptosis once Yap overexpression is turned off
(Camargo et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2007). Similarly, liver specific knockout of Mst1/2, Sav1,
or Nf2 also results in liver enlargement (Yin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010; Zhou et al.,
2009). The mouse embryonic heart is enlarged when Sav1, Mst1/2, or Lats1/2 is deleted, and
proliferation or apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is sensitive to genetic manipulation of Yap (Del
Re et al., 2013; Heallen et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2014; von Gise et al., 2012; Xin et al., 2013;
Xin et al., 2011).

Author Manuscript

However, not all organs are equally sensitive to Hippo pathway mutations. For instance,
Mst1/2 knockout results in dramatic overgrowth of liver, heart, stomach, and spleen, but not
of kidney, lung, or limbs (Song et al., 2010). A possible explanation is that there are
MST1/2-independent regulators of YAP/TAZ in these tissues. In the breast and intestine,
tissue-specific deletion of Yap does not result in any defects in tissue structure or size (Cai et
al., 2010; Chen et al., 2014). Yap knockout in the mouse liver leads to bile duct defects but
not a general reduction of liver size. This lack of effect could be due to the presence of TAZ,
which should be activated due to the loss of feedback inhibition upon Yap deletion.
Alternatively, the Hippo pathway, or YAP/TAZ activity, may be negligible for the size
control of some organs. Nevertheless, the organ specific effects of the Hippo pathway in size
control may suggest that different principles are utilized for size regulation in different
organs. For example, organ size could be determined by proliferation of differentiated cells
or the number of progenitor cells in a pre-allocated pool.

Author Manuscript

Physiological signals upstream of the Hippo pathway important in organ size determination
have yet to be identified. Mechanical force or tension may change as a result of organ
growth and inhibit YAP/TAZ when the organ reaches its final size. Alternatively, organ size
may be restricted/induced by a soluble factor via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, and the
concentration of this factor is controlled by organ size. These two models are not mutually
exclusive, and further investigations are needed to address how the Hippo pathway senses
physiological cues to modulate organ size.
High YAP/TAZ activity has been observed in the stem or progenitor cells of multiple
tissues, suggesting a role for YAP/TAZ in stem cell maintenance. For example, YAP is
highly nuclear in basal progenitor cells and in intestinal stem cells localized at the crypt base
(Barry et al., 2013; Camargo et al., 2007; Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011).

Activation of YAP, either by transgenic expression of YAP or deletion of upstream
regulators, usually results in expansion of progenitor cells, impaired cell differentiation, and
hyperplasia of target tissues such as intestine, liver, skin, and nervous system (Cai et al.,
2010; Camargo et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2010; Lu et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2011).

Author Manuscript

The role of YAP/TAZ on cell proliferation and stem cell expansion suggests a critical
function of YAP in normal tissue development and homeostasis. Indeed, tissue-specific
deletion of Yap results in abnormalities of the heart, skin, and kidney (Reginensi et al., 2013;
Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; von Gise et al., 2012; Xin et al., 2011). However, mammary
glands and the intestine remain relatively normal upon Yap deletion (Cai et al., 2010; Chen
et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2011). These findings suggest that YAP is required for development
and homeostasis of some, but not all, tissues in mice. In human, TEAD1 mutations are found
in Sveinsson chorioretinal atrophy, a disease characterized by chorioretinal degeneration,
and Aicardi syndrome, a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder (Fossdal et al., 2004;
Schrauwen et al., 2015). In addition, loss-of-function mutations of YAP have been identified
in both isolated and syndromic optic fissure closure defects (Williamson et al., 2014).
Hence, the loss of TEAD-mediated YAP transcriptional activity plays a role in some
degeneration related disorders in humans.

Author Manuscript

Even though it is not required for development and normal homeostasis of some tissues,
YAP activity is critical for tissue regeneration upon certain types of damage. For example,
Yap deletion severely compromises pregnancy-induced mammary tissue growth, although
virgin mammary development was normal (Chen et al., 2014). Likewise, in wild type mice,
the intestines can effectively regenerate following colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS) treatment; however, the regenerative capability is severely impeded in conditional
Yap knockout mice (Cai et al., 2010). Similar results have also been observed in Drosophila
midgut regeneration upon DSS-induced injury (Karpowicz et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2010;
Shaw et al., 2010). Normally the liver regenerates efficiently following liver damage. For
instance, after partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes start to proliferate to restore liver mass in a
few days, and in this process, YAP activity is induced and is most likely required for
complete liver regeneration (Grijalva et al., 2014; Su et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013; Yimlamai
et al., 2014). In contrast to the intestine and liver, tissue regeneration of the adult heart is
very limited. However, inactivation of the Hippo pathway or transgenic expression of Yap
restores some myocardial regenerative capability, although the efficiency is low. In contrast,
cardiac-specific deletion of Yap impedes regeneration of the neonatal heart. (Heallen et al.,
2013; Lin et al., 2014; Xin et al., 2013). Taken together, these results indicate that YAP
plays a significant role in regeneration of multiple tissues.

Hippo Signaling in Cancer
Long-term YAP activation, such as transgenic expression of Yap in the mouse liver, results
in cell transformation and tumor development (Dong et al., 2007), indicating the power of
the Hippo pathway in cancer initiation and progression. Evidence of the Hippo pathway in
tumorigenesis based on mouse models is summarized in Table 2, which generally supports

an oncogenic role for YAP and TAZ, as well as a tumor suppressive function for Hippo
pathway upstream components.

Author Manuscript

The tumor-promoting activity of YAP is largely dependent on a TEAD-mediated
transcription program, as YAP-induced liver cancer is fully blocked by expression of a
dominant negative TEAD which is able to sequester both YAP and TAZ (Liu-Chittenden et
al., 2012). At the cellular level, YAP activation is important for cell proliferation, survival,
migration, and invasion. High YAP or TAZ activity enables the cell to escape contact
inhibition and anoikis, and support anchorage-independent growth (Chan et al., 2008; Zhao
et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2007). YAP induces expression of ZEB1/2 to stimulate the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a key step for tumor metastasis (Gao
et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010b; Overholtzer et al., 2006). In addition, YAP is
able to promote genomic instability (Fernandez et al., 2012), and TAZ is required to sustain
self-renewal and the tumor-initiation capacity of breast cancer stem cells (Cordenonsi et al.,
2011).
Accumulating evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway is dysregulated in many human
cancers. Elevated YAP/TAZ expression or nuclear enrichment of YAP/TAZ has been
observed in many types of cancers, including liver, breast, lung, colon, ovary, and others
(Chan et al., 2008; Moroishi et al., 2015a; Steinhardt et al., 2008). However, the majority of
cancers with high YAP/TAZ activity have not been linked to genetic mutations of the Hippo
pathway, and the overall genetic alteration rate of Hippo pathway components in human
cancer is relatively low (Table 3).

Author Manuscript

One well-characterized example of a Hippo pathway mutation associated with cancer is in
NF2, which causes neurofibromatosis 2 lesions including schwannomas and meningiomas
(Xiao et al., 2003). Moreover, inactivating NF2 mutations are also observed in 40-50% of
malignant mesothelioma (Sekido, 2011). Importantly, even heterozygous deletion of Yap
completely blocks liver tumorigenesis induced by Nf2 knockout in mice, indicating that
YAP activation is the major mechanism mediating the tumorigenic potential of Nf2
mutations (Zhang et al., 2010).

Author Manuscript

YAP gene amplification may contribute to a portion of hepatocellular carcinomas,
medulloblastomas, and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (Fernandez et al., 2009;
Overholtzer et al., 2006; Song et al., 2014; Zender et al., 2006). Gene fusions involving YAP
and TAZ have also been discovered in human cancers. Remarkably, virtually all epithelioid
hemangioendotheliomas contain gene fusions of TAZ-CAMTA1, TAZ-FOSB, or YAP-TFE3
(Antonescu et al., 2013; Errani et al., 2011; Flucke et al., 2014; Tanas et al., 2011). In
addition, YAP gene fusions with MAMLD1 or C11orf95 have been discovered in a subset of
ependymal tumors (Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014). It is worth noting that in both
epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas and ependymal tumors, all YAP/TAZ fusions proteins
retain their N-terminal TEAD binding domain, but lose the C-terminal transactivation
domain. These observations suggest that these YAP fusions may still bind to and activate the
TEAD dependent transcriptional program to promote tumorigenesis. Indeed, neural stem
cells carrying the YAP-C11orf95 fusion gene can effectively form brain tumors when grafted
into mice (Parker et al., 2014). In addition, a familial YAP point mutation (R331W) has also

been reported to correlate with a high incidence of lung adenocarcinomas (Chen et al.,
2015a).
Aberrant GPCR signaling often results in tumorigenesis, so it is possible that GPCR
dysregulation can cause cancer by activating YAP/TAZ. GNAQ or GNA11 (encoding Gαq or
Gα11, respectively) activating mutations have been identified in approximately 80% of uveal
melanomas and function as driver mutations (Van Raamsdonk et al., 2009; Van Raamsdonk
et al., 2010). Recent studies showed that YAP is constitutively activated in mutant GNAQ or
GNA11 mutant uveal melanomas and the high YAP activity contributes to tumor growth
(Feng et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014). In mice, deletion of GNAS (encoding GαS) in skin stem
cells initiates basal-cell carcinogenesis, which is partially dependent on YAP (IglesiasBartolome et al., 2015). Moreover, expression of a viral GPCR induces tumorigenesis in
Kaposi's sarcoma, where YAP/TAZ also play a critical role (Liu et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

LATS1/2 mutations or gene fusion have been sporadically identified in different cancers
which may lead to YAP/TAZ activation (Table 3). In addition, Crosstalk with other cancerrelated signaling pathways also likely contributes to high YAP/TAZ activity in cancers that
have no mutations of Hippo pathway components. For example, KRAS, APC, and LKB1
mutations have all been reported to activate YAP/TAZ (Azzolin et al., 2014; Gao et al.,
2014; Mohseni et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014a).

Author Manuscript

YAP/TAZ activity is also linked to drug resistance and cancer relapse. Cultured breast
cancer cells with high YAP/TAZ activity show resistance to drugs such as taxol, 5fluorouracil, and doxorubicin (Cordenonsi et al., 2011; Lai et al., 2011; Touil et al., 2014).
Furthermore, lung and colon cancer cells with high YAP activity are resistant to RAF- and
MEK-targeted therapies (Lin et al., 2015b). Tamoxifen is commonly used to treat estrogen
receptor (ER, a nuclear receptor) positive breast cancer; however, some ER positive breast
cancers are insensitive to tamoxifen. Recently, tamoxifen has been shown to activate
YAP/TAZ by stimulating the membrane estrogen receptor GPER, a GPCR. Therefore,
activation of GPER by tamoxifen or estrogen may contribute to tumor growth and drug
resistance (Zhou et al., 2015). Amplification of the YAP gene has been associated with
cancer relapse in KRAS-driven colon and pancreatic cancers (Kapoor et al., 2014; Shao et
al., 2014). Thus, inhibition of YAP/TAZ will not only target tumor initiation and
progression, but also potentially sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapies and prevent cancer
relapse.

Author Manuscript

Notably, in contrast to its oncogenic function in most solid tumors, YAP seems to play a
tumor-suppressor role in hematological cancers. The YAP gene locus is frequently deleted in
hematological cancer and expression of YAP or inhibition of MST1 leads to growth
inhibition and increased apoptosis (Cottini et al., 2014). Currently, the underlying
mechanism responsible for this tumor suppressor function of YAP in hematological cancers
is not well understood.

Therapeutic Targeting of Hippo Signaling
The core Hippo pathway is a kinase cascade, and protein kinases are usually druggable.
Thus, inhibitors for MAP4K4, MST1/2, or LATS1/2 may be developed to induce YAP/TAZ

activity and facilitate the process of wound healing, tissue repair, or regeneration, and
possibly for treating degenerative diseases (Figure 4). For example, temporal inhibition of
MST1/2 or LATS1/2 may promote myocardial regeneration or survival that would be
beneficial for heart attack patients. It is also possible that inhibitors of MST1/2 or LATS1/2
could be used for treating hematological cancers.

Author Manuscript

Generally, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are tumor suppressors, and inhibition of MST1/2 or
LATS1/2 may promote tumor growth in most instances. On the other hand, inhibiting
YAP/TAZ activity would offer a new and attractive anti-cancer strategy (Park and Guan,
2013). The function of YAP/TAZ is primarily mediated by TEADs, so small molecules
disrupting the YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction will function as YAP/TAZ inhibitors. Indeed,
porphyrin family molecules, especially verteporfin, are able to disrupt the interaction
between YAP/TAZ and TEADs, and verteporfin can block transcription of YAP/TAZ target
genes and suppress liver overgrowth induced by YAP over-expression or NF2 inactivation
in mice (Liu-Chittenden et al., 2012). However, verteporfin has general cellular toxicity and
low aqueous solubility. Based on structural information from the YAP-TEAD and VGLL4TEAD complex, a polypeptide termed “super-TDU” has been designed to block YAPTEAD interaction, and has been shown to suppress tumor growth in mouse models (Jiao et
al., 2014).

Author Manuscript

It is challenging to design direct activators for protein kinases. However, LATS1/2 may be
activated indirectly by molecules targeting their upstream regulators. The very first small
molecule (dobutamine) identified with an inhibitory effect on YAP is an antagonist of a
GPCR receptor (Bao et al., 2011). Since then, many indirect inhibitors for YAP/TAZ have
been identified, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors rolipram and ibudilast (Yu et al.,
2013a). The Rho family GTPases have a strong inhibitory effect on LATS1/2, and
membrane localization is important for Rho cellular function. Indeed, mevalonate metabolic
pathway inhibitor statins can block membrane translocation of Rho GTPases and indirectly
inhibit YAP/TAZ activity (Mi et al., 2015; Sorrentino et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). It will
be interesting to test whether these drugs are effective in suppressing tumor growth in mouse
models and perform epidemiologic studies to determine whether patients using statins or
rolipram have a lower incidence of cancer. Given the important function of the Hippo
pathway in regulating cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis, it represents an exciting and
previously unexplored field for cancer therapy.

Outstanding Questions
Despite the rapid research progress in the Hippo pathway, some key questions remain
unanswered and new questions are emerging. Listed below are some of the key questions
in the Hippo field.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

1.

What are the molecular mechanisms regulating MST1/2 activity? Many
upstream signals have been convincingly shown to regulate LATS1/2
phosphorylation and kinase activity. However, neither MST1/2 phosphorylation
nor its kinase activity is strongly modulated by upstream signals. Drosophila
misshapen (a member of MAP4K in mammals) acts upstream of Wts. An
interesting question is whether MST1/2 and MAP4Ks mediate different or
similar upstream signals to activate LATS1/2.

2.

Where are Hippo pathway components localized in mammalian cells? This may
be key to understanding how the Hippo pathway is regulated in response to
upstream signals. It is obvious that phosphorylated YAP/TAZ are enriched in
the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated YAP/TAZ in the nucleus. However, it is
less clear where YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occur. A
related question is what are the mechanisms underlying YAP/TAZ translocation
between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

3.

How are LATS1/2 regulated by actin remodeling and/or cellular tension? This is
one of the key questions in understanding the biochemical mechanism of the
Hippo kinase cascade regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the actin
cytoskeleton and cellular tension play a key role in LATS1/2 regulation and
appear to act downstream of many, if not most, upstream signals. The actin
cytoskeleton and cellular tension are intertwined, thus the question is: which one
plays a more direct role in regulating Hippo core components?

4.

What is the mechanism of organ size sensing? Although many signals are
reported to regulate the Hippo pathway in vitro, so far none have been
demonstrated to play a key role in organ size control in vivo. Uncovering this
magic signal will solve a key question in developmental biology.

5.

How does YAP become deregulated in cancer? It is clear that YAP/TAZ
activation is observed in a broad spectrum of human cancers, although
mutations in Hippo pathway genes are rare. This interesting conundrum
indicates that the Hippo pathway maybe regulated broadly by many other cancer
driving pathways.

Figure 1.

Inhibition of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators by LATS1/2. (A) When Hippo signaling
is off, YAP/TAZ enters the nucleus, competes with VGLL4 for TEADs, and recruits other
factors to induce gene transcription. YAP/TAZ may bind proximal promoters or distal
enhancers of target genes to induce transcription. (B) When Hippo signaling is on,
YAP/TAZ is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 on multiple sites, resulting interaction with 14-3-3
and cytoplasmic retention; phosphorylation also leads to YAP/TAZ poly-ubiquitination and
degradation. VGLL4 interacts with TEADs and represses target gene transcription.

Regulation of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila. The Hippo pathway is regulated by cell
adhesion molecules (Ed), determinants of cell polarity (Crb, Fat/Ds, Scrib complex), and
mechanical cues (spectrin, F-actin, or cellular tension). In addition, Hpo is regulated by Tao,
salt induced kinase (Sik), Ras-associated factor (Rassf), striatin-interacting phosphatase and
kinase (STRIPAK) complex; Wts is regulated by Zyxin (Zyx) and Jub; Yki is regulated by
WW Domain Binding Protein 2 (Wbp2), Hipk, and Multiple ankyrin repeats single KH
domain (Mask) (refer to (Varelas, 2014)). Arrows, blunt ends, and dashed lines indicate
activation, inhibition, and indirect regulation, respectively.

Regulation of the Hippo pathway in mammals. The Hippo pathway is regulated by diverse
signals: 1) Determinants of cell polarity and cell-cell junctions, such as SCRIB that interacts
with MST1/2 and LATS1/2, AMOT, PTPN14, and α-Catenin, which can sequester
YAP/TAZ to cell junctions; 2) Mechanical cues, such as stiffness, cell contact, cell
geometry, and cell attachment status that regulate the Hippo pathway by modulating activity
of Rho GTPases, remodeling the actin cytoskeleton, or altering cellular tension. Both apical
and basolateral spectrin networks may function as sensors for mechanical cues in Hippo
pathway regulation; 3) Soluble factors, especially ligands for GPCRs, regulate LATS1/2
likely through Rho GTPases and actin dynamics; 4) Metabolic status, such as cellular energy
and oxygen stress, also regulate Hippo signaling. Many other proteins such as protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), WBP2, CDK1, MASK, and HIPK can
also regulate activities of different Hippo pathway components (refer to (Varelas, 2014)).
Arrows, blunt ends, and dashed lines indicate activation, inhibition, and indirect regulation,
respectively.

normal tissue development and homeostasis. (B) Strategies for targeting YAP/TAZ activity.
Inhibitors for MST1/2, MAP4K4, and LATS1/2 can activate YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ-TEAD
interaction may be disrupted by small molecules directly (Verteporfin) or AMPK activators
(Metformin). Small molecules inhibiting Rho family GTPases or ROCK can indirectly
activate LATS1/2, leading to YAP/TAZ inhibition.
