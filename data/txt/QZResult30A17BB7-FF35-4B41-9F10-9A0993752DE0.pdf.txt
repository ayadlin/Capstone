Comment re: Temozolomide
Preferentially Depletes Cancer
Stem Cells
To the Editor:
Beier and colleagues (1), in contrast to previous studies (2–4),
show that temozolomide depletes clonogenic and highly
tumorigenic cells in glioblastoma cultures and reduces tumorigenicity in vivo. The in vivo studies, however, raise concerns.
Tumor xenografts were measured on T2-weighted magnetic
resonance images (MRI; TR/TE 4,000/73 ms). In Fig. 6A of their
report, the hyperintense signal of the xenograft is similar
to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At this TR/TE value, a glial tumor
without necrotic or cystic areas is expected to be less
hyperintense than CSF (Fig. 1A and B, arrow). Although the
MRI appearance may depend on transplantation techniques, the
hyperintense signal of the xenografts seems related to regressive
phenomena (5). In Fig. 6A of ref. 1 (upper and lower left), the
ventricles homolateral to the tumor are not compressed or
displaced as expected (Fig. 1C and D); conversely, they seem
slightly enlarged. Furthermore, the untreated xenograft in Fig. 6A
of ref. 1 (upper left) shows an extra-axial CSF collection that does
not favor the presence of an underlying mass lesion.
Glioblastoma cancer stem cells (CSCs) are known to generate
tumors in vivo that phenocopy the parent tumor, although
vascularity and heterogeneity may be less prominent. In Fig. 6B
and C of ref. 1, however, the xenografts lack glioblastoma features

resembling foci of anaplastic astrocytoma, therefore suggesting
that the grafted CSCs may have lost the grade of malignancy of
parental glioblastoma.
Pretreatment with temozolomide dose-dependently reduced the
size of tumor xenografts irrespective of the O6 methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status of the CSCs. Indeed,
tumor size substantially decreased in mice injected with CSCs
exposed to 50 Amol/L of temozolomide relative to the 5 Amol/L
dose, as shown in Fig. 6A and B of ref. 1. However, Fig. 6D of
ref. 1 shows that proliferation of R28 cells does not significantly
differ between 5 and 50 Amol/L of temozolomide. Changing
the interpretation of Beier and colleagues, we propose that early
after implantation 50 Amol/L-temozolomide treatment had been
more effective than 5 Amol/L but 12 weeks later the tumors
proliferated with similar rates. Beier and colleagues show that
temozolomide-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells actually continue
to proliferate in vitro. The same may happen when xenografting
the cells. Obtaining any data on cell death would have been
beneficial. Future studies are needed to fully understand the effects
of temozolomide and other therapies on different tumor cell
populations in this heterogenous disease.
