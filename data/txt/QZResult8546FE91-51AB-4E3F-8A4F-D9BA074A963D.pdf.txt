ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is both the most common and the most lethal primary brain
tumor. It is thought that GBM stem cells (GSCs) are critically important in resistance
to therapy. Therefore, there is a strong rationale to target these cells in order to
develop new molecular therapies.
To identify molecular targets in GSCs, we compared gene expression in GSCs
to that in neural stem cells (NSCs) from the adult human brain, using microarrays.
Bioinformatic filtering identified 20 genes (PBK/TOPK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6,
DLG7/DLGAP5/HURP, KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR/RHAMM/CD168, NOL4, MPP6, MDM1,
RAPGEF4, RHBDD1, FNDC3B, FILIP1L, MCC, ATXN7L4/ATXN7L1, P2RY5/LPAR6 and
FAM118A) that were consistently expressed in GSC cultures and consistently not
expressed in NSC cultures. The expression of these genes was confirmed in clinical
samples (TCGA and REMBRANDT). The first nine genes were highly co-expressed in
all GBM subtypes and were part of the same protein-protein interaction network.
Furthermore, their combined up-regulation correlated negatively with patient survival
in the mesenchymal GBM subtype. Using targeted proteomics and the COGNOSCENTE
database we linked these genes to GBM signalling pathways.
Nine genes: PBK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2 and HMMR
should be further explored as targets for treatment of GBM.

one year [1], although 15 months is reported for selected
patients in some clinical trials [2].
Using methods developed to investigate neural stem
cells (NSCs) from the adult human brain [3–6], we and
others have isolated and propagated stem-like cells from
GBMs [7–11]. Dissociated GBM biopsies grown as freefloating tumorspheres in serum-free medium containing
mitogens epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent primary
brain tumor. Patient prognosis is poor because tumor
cells infiltrating brain tissue surrounding the tumor
elude surgery, and adjuvant treatment with irradiation
and chemotherapy has only a moderate effect on these
remaining cells. As a result, median survival is less than

P2RY5/LPAR6 and FAM118A (Figure 1A, Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure S1). These genes were all highly
co-expressed in all samples as illustrated by hierarchical
clustering using Pearson correlation as a distance metric
(Figure 1B). These initial findings were then confirmed
with a number of experimental techniques and public
database mining in order to make a final selection of
potentially interesting genes.

fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are highly enriched for
GBM stem cells (GSCs) [10, 11]. Furthermore, tumor cells
derived from these spheres bear genotypic resemblance to
the original tumor to a greater extent than serum-cultured
cell lines [12]. Upon xenografting, GSCs can restore the
phenotype of the original tumor [11] and this ability is
sustained even after serial transplantations [8]. GSCs are
thought to be responsible for the persistence of GBM
growth following therapy [13]. They exhibit efficient
protective mechanisms, such as multidrug resistance and
DNA repair enzymes that protect them against cytostatic
drugs and irradiation [14, 15]. Current therapy therefore
mainly targets tumor bulk, thus resulting in a relative
enrichment of GSCs [14, 15]. The cancer stem cell
hypothesis predicts that these cells must be eradicated
in order to obtain a cure [16, 17]. Consequently there is
a need for identifying specific molecular targets within
GSCs.
The non-cancerous cell type that most closely
resembles the GSC is the NSC. NSCs can differentiate into
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and fully functional neurons
[3, 4], and do not form tumors following transplantation to
the mouse brain [7, 18].
To identify therapeutic targets in GSCs, we
combined experimental techniques for analysis of gene
and protein expression with public database mining. The
increased expression of the selected candidate genes at
RNA and protein levels was verified in GSC cultures
from independent patient cohorts using qPCR, western
blot and immunolabeling. Combining all our results, we
found that the increased expression of nine genes (PBK,
CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2
and HMMR) in GSCs and GBM tissues was confirmed
with all experimental and bioinformatic methods. They
were highly co-expressed in all GBM subtypes and their
combined up-regulation correlated with poor patient
survival. Thus, there is a strong rationale to explore these
nine genes as targets for treatment of GBM.

Confirmation of gene expression in an
independent set of samples
To confirm the expression of the 20 selected genes,
we used real-time quantitative reverse-transcription
PCR (qPCR) analysis on independent sets of freshly
isolated samples: seven new GSC and four new NSC
cultures (Figure 1C–1C’). For each gene, one to seven
oligonucleotide primer sets, approximately 1 kb apart
from one another, were designed and tested in three GSC
and two NSC cultures (Supplementary Figure S2). For the
main analysis, only the best performing set was selected.
The expression of the selected 20 genes was also tested
in a neural fetal cell (NFC) line (ReNcell, Millipore)
(Supplementary Figure S3). qPCR analysis was performed
on seven new GSC cultures using multiple NSC cultures
and a NFC line as reference (Figure 1C–1C’, Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S1). It showed that 15 of the 20
selected genes (PBK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6,
DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR, NOL4, MCC, MPP6,
RAPGEF4, ATXN7L4 and MDM1) were significantly
up-regulated while FAM118A and P2RY5 were downregulated (Figure 1C–1C’). We did not observe differential
regulation of FILIP1L, RHBDD1 and FNDC3B by qPCR.
We also calculated the Pearson correlation (PPMCC “r”)
coefficient between fold change values on microarrays
and qPCR. Average correlation for all genes was r = 0.51,
while the best correlation (r = 0.94) was observed for the
following genes: CENPA, DLG7, PBK, MCC, MPPG,
KIF18A and DEPDC1.
Differences in culturing conditions are known to
influence RNA and protein expression levels, as well as
causing differentiation of GSCs [20]. Before analyzing
the expression of the 20 selected genes in the new GSC
cultures by qPCR, we had to establish a proper set of
controls with matching differentiation state, growth
parameters and gene expression. The control set consisted
of NSCs from different parts of the brain that were grown
in three alternative ways, and an NFC line. When cultured
as neurospheres, NSCs from the normal human brain
typically grow slower than GSCs [7]. As several of the
20 selected genes are involved in cell division and the

RESULTS
Identification of genes consistently expressed in
GSCs and consistently not-expressed in NSCs
using microarray
In our previous work, we compared GSCs to
NSCs from the adult human brain and found a 30-gene
signature of highly expressed genes characteristic for
GSCs and for several signaling pathways such as the Wnt
pathway, that were dysregulated in GSCs [19]. The aim
of the current study was to identify genes that can serve
as potential therapeutic targets in GSCs. To find genes
consistently not expressed in NSCs and consistently
expressed in GSCs, we applied a selection rule picking
out genes with log2 expression value below zero in all
NSC cultures and log2 expression value above zero

Expression of the 20 selected genes in GSC and NSC cultures, measured by microarrays, qPCR and western blot is
presented. The results of bioinformatics analysis are presented as: -impact of the gene expression on survival, -expression in
GBM tissues and LGG and as correlation between protein and RNA expression (Pearson r).

parameters can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
cell cycle, we questioned whether these genes were upregulated in GSCs solely because of increased growth
rates. We therefore, utilized three alternative protocols
to cultivate NSCs: 1. free-floating neurospheres [3, 21],
2. adherent monolayers in a slightly modified neurosphere
medium containing 1% serum, bFGF and TGFα (AD1%
medium) [22], and 3. cells cultured on retronectin-coated
wells containing serum-free neurosphere medium [23]. This
last protocol has previously only been used for mouse cells.
We found that adult human NSCs incubated on
RN in neurosphere medium behaved quite similarly to
the NSCs grown according to the other two protocols
(Figure 2A–2D). These cultures expressed high levels
of nestin and only a small fraction of the cells expressed
the differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) and β3-tubulin (TUBB3) (Figure 2A–2D). All
three culturing conditions used for human NSCs thus
promoted growth of undifferentiated cells and may serve
as appropriate controls for GSCs, in further analyses.
Comparisons of NES, GFAP and TUBB3 expressions in
GSC, NSC and NFC cultures at RNA and protein levels
using qPCR and western blot are also presented (Figure 5
and Supplementary Figures S3–S5).
To further test whether NFCs and NSCs grown
in different conditions are suitable as controls, we also
determined the growth parameters for all cultures. Both
the growth curves and the cell population doubling times
(PDT) were analyzed (Figure 2G–2J). The average PDT
for two NSC cultures incubated on RN was 5.9 ± 2.4
days. The average PDTs for multiple passages of two
NSC cultures grown adherently in AD1% medium and
NFCs grown as spheres were 2.9 ± 0.7 and 2.1 ± 0.5 days,
respectively (Figure 2G–2H). In comparison, the PDT for
GSC cultures varied between two to eight days (Figure
2G–2H). The PDT values for all our control cell cultures
ranged from two to eight days, thus fulfilling the criteria
for adequate growth rate controls.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The GSC cultures were further characterized using
a sphere-forming assay where the average number and
diameter of spheres were calculated (Figure 2I–2J).
While the size of the spheres only varied slightly between
the GSC cultures, we detected a positive correlation
between number of spheres and reciprocal values of PDTs
(r = 0.88) (Figure 2G and 2I).
The expression of the selected 20 genes did not
differ significantly between NSCs derived from three
different anatomical locations or cultured under three
different conditions (Supplementary Figures S3, S4
and S5). Even the NSCs, cultured adherently in AD1%
medium, with PDT comparable to the fastest growing
GSC cultures, did not express increased levels of these
genes (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figures S5).
Our analysis thus showed that NSCs and NFCs
represent suitable controls for our experiments with GSCs,
both in terms of growth parameters and differentiation
state. Neither the growth rates of the cells nor the
immortalization of NFCs significantly influenced the
expression levels of the 20 selected genes. This indicates
that the increased expression of the tested genes is an
inherent feature of GSCs.

Expression of the 20 selected genes in tissue
samples from GBMs and LGGs
We also analyzed the mRNA expression of the
20 selected genes in tissues derived from GBMs and
LGGs using the two largest publicly available databases,
REMBRANDT (https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/)
and TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Analysis of the
data from these databases confirmed the expression of all 20
genes in GBM tissues (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S2).
Integrated genomic analysis has previously
identified four molecular subtypes of GBM: proneural,
neural, mesenchymal and classical [24]. To determine

cultures incubated on RN remained predominantly undifferentiated. Short incubation (up to a few weeks) on RN resulted in NSC cultures
that were 99% nestin positive (NES) (A) while only 5.2% and 1.2% of cells were TUBB3 (C) and GFAP (B) positive, respectively.

the expression of the selected 20 genes within the GBM
subtypes, we used a formerly described gene expression
data set of 200 GBM samples from TCGA [24]. By
applying hierarchical clustering to the entire set of GBM
samples, 19 of the genes (RHBDD1 was not represented)
could be grouped into three clusters according to their
mRNA expression levels (Figure 3A). The first cluster
included nine genes (CENPA, DLG7, PBK, CDC6,
KIF15, KIF18A, EZH2, DEPDC1 and HMMR), the
second eight genes (FILIP1L, MCC, MPP6, ATXN7L4,
P2RY5, FAM118A, FNDC3B and MADM1), and the
third two genes (NOL4, RAPGEF4) (Figure 3A). While
the expression levels of the whole 20-gene set seemed
to be highly correlated in the GSC and NSC cultures
(Figure 1B), only the nine genes in cluster I seemed to be
consistently co-expressed in all GBM subtypes in tissue
samples from tumor bulk (Figure 3B). Our analysis thus
identified a co-expression module (cluster I) characteristic
for both GSCs and GBM (Figures 1A and 3B). When
it comes to the level of expression this nine-gene
co-expression module was particularly highly expressed
in proneural tumors and relatively weakly expressed in
neural tumors (Figure 3C–3D). NOL4 and RAPGEF4
(cluster III) were highly expressed in proneural and
weakly expressed in mesenchymal tumors (Figure 3C–3D).
FNDC3B and FILIP1L were weakly expressed in the
neural subtype (Figure 3D). FNDC3B, FILIP1L and
P2RY5 (cluster II) were consistently up-regulated in
mesenchymal tumors (Figure 3E). Only NOL4 and MCC
have previously been identified as typical proneural and
classical gene reporters, respectively [24]. This is in
accordance with our results (Figure 3C and 3F).
We further compared GBMs to LGGs using the
gene expression dataset from REMBRANDT. At a FDR
of 10%, 16 of our 20 genes were represented with 34
probes. Out of these 16 genes, 11 were up-regulated in
GBMs compared to LGGs (CENPA, DLG7, PBK, CDC6,
KIF15, KIF18A, EZH2, DEPDC1, HMMR, FILIP1L and
FNDC3B) (Supplementary Table S2).

survival in the GBM subtypes from TCGA revealed that
the concurrent up-regulation of the nine genes correlated
negatively with patient survival in the mesenchymal
(Figure 4C) but not in the other GBM subtypes (not
shown). The Kaplan-Meier graph showed reduction in
median survival from 468 to 199 days in mesenchymal
GBM patients upon increased expression of the nine genes
(Figure 4C).
The expression of the 20 selected genes and patient
survival were also analyzed in the REMBRANDT
dataset for groups including a) all gliomas irrespective of
histological grade, and b) LGGs (predominantly grade II).
The expression values for 51 probes representing 18 of
our genes were significant and could predict survival (not
shown). When considering glioma patients as one group
irrespective of histological grade, the increased expression
of 15 genes (CENPA, DLG7, PBK, FILIP1L, CDC6,
MCC, KIF15, MPP6, KIF18A, EZH2, DEPDC1, HMMR,
P2RY5, FAM118A, and FNDC3B) correlated with the
least favorable survival (Supplementary Figure S6A). In
addition, FNDC3B was found to be a significant predictor
of survival within the LGG group (Supplementary
Figure S6B). The small size of the GBM sample set in the
REMBRANDT database limited Kaplan-Meier analysis to
only a few genes (Supplementary Figure S6, table).

Confirmation of expression at protein level,
targeted proteomics and regulatory networks
To further explore the potential for therapeutic
targeting, we analyzed the expression of the proteins
encoded by the 20 selected genes using western blot,
immunolabeling, targeted proteomics and bioinformatics.
Western blot showed that 15 of the proteins encoded
by the 20 selected genes were up-regulated in all
tested GSC cultures: CENPA, DLG7, PBK, FILIPL1,
DEPDC1, NOL4, CDC6, KIF15, MPP6, KIF18A, EZH2,
HMMR, FAM118A, FNDC3B and MDM1 (Figure 5A,
Supplementary Figure S7). Two of the five remaining
proteins were not differentially regulated at the protein
level (RHBDD1 and ATXN7L4), while three were
down-regulated (P2Y5, MCC and RAPGEF4) in GSC
cultures (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S7). It has
been shown that the protein amount can not always be
deduced by measuring mRNA levels [25]. To calculate
correlation between the mRNA and the corresponding
protein levels, we quantified western data and translated
them into relative protein expression (RPE) values (Figure
5A, Table 1). These were used to calculate Pearson
correlation between RNA and protein expression for
each gene (for details see Material and Methods section).
For 17 genes (PBK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6,
DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR, NOL4, MPP6, MDM1,
FNDC3B, FILIP1L, ATXN7L4, P2RY5 and FAM118A),
we found good correlation (r = 0.64 + 021) between the
RNA and the corresponding protein levels (Table 1). For
three genes (RAPGEF4, RHBDD1 and MCC), we found

Correlation between gene expression and patient
survival
To explore the correlation between clinical outcome
and the expression levels of the 20 selected genes, we
performed analyses based on the REMBRANDT and
TCGA datasets. The gene expression analysis of the 200
GBM samples [24] from TCGA showed that the combined
expression of the nine genes in cluster I had a significant
effect on survival (Figure 4B–4C). Based on the mRNA
expression levels of these nine genes, the GBMs from
TCGA samples were divided into three groups: low
(green), intermediate (black) and high expression (red;
Figure 4A). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that
concurrent up-regulation of these nine genes correlated
with a moderate but significant decrement in survival
of GBM patients (Figure 4B). Further analysis of the

Figure 3: Expression of the 20 selected genes in GBM tissue specimens. A. Expression of the 19 selected genes (RHBDD1 was

not represented) in the set of 200 GBM tissue samples from the TCGA database [24] is presented as a hierarchical clustering chart. The
genes are divided into three groups according to their expression. B. Expression of the 19 genes calculated for each of the GBM subtypes
(proneural, mesenchymal, neural and classical) presented as a hierarchical clustering with distance matrix (Pearson) chart. Each square
represents correlation between two genes. Red corresponds to higher correlation levels. This analysis showed that particularly the nine
following genes: CENPA, DLG7, PBK, CDC6, KIF15, KIF18A, EZH2, DEPDC1 and HMMR (red text) were highly co-expressed in all
four subtypes. C–F. Both the hierarchical clustering (Squared Euclidian) and the hierarchical clustering with distance matrix (Pearson) are
shown for the 19 genes in each of the GBM subtypes. For panels on the left each square represents the degree of linear dependence (Pearson
correlation) between two samples. For the majority of proneural tumors (C, panel on the left) the degrees of linear dependences between
the samples were high thus indicating that the expression of the whole 19-gene set was uniform in the majority of the tissue samples of this
GBM subtype. The panel on the right (C) shows that especially the nine genes from cluster I (CENPA, DLG7, PBK, CDC6, KIF15, KIF18A,
EZH2, DEPDC1, HMMR) and the two genes from cluster III, (NOL4 and RAPGEF4) were highly expressed in the majority of proneural
samples. The expression of these genes was weaker in the mesenchymal, neural and classical GBM subtypes (D–F, right). (E) NOL4 and
RAPGEF4 were lowly expressed while FND3C, P2RY5 and FILIP1L were highly expressed in the mesenchymal subtype. MCC and NOL4
were previously characterized as the genes that specify the classical (F) and proneural (C) subtypes respectively [24].

Figure 4: Correlation between gene expression and the survival of GBM patients. A. The correlation between gene expression

and survival was calculated using the set of 200 GBM samples from the TCGA database described in Verhaak et al., 2010 [24]. This material
contained 54 classical, 58 mesenchymal, 57 proneural and 33 neural GBM tissue samples. Using hierarchical clustering, the patients were
sorted according to the expression of the nine genes in gene cluster I (from Figure 3A). B. The survival times of GBM patients with the
highest and lowest expression of the nine genes were compared. The subclassification of these patient groups is described in the text on the
left (high = blue and low = red). This analysis showed that the concurrent high expression of the nine genes had a negative effect on patient
survival (median survival reduced from 383 to 290 days). The calculated p value was p = 0.00196 (Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test). C. The
survival times of mesenchymal subtype of GBM patients with the highest and lowest expression of the nine genes were compared (median
survival reduced from 468 to 199 days). The calculated p value was p = 0.0039 (Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test).

hierarchical clustering with distance matrix (Pearson),
we analyzed the expression of a) proteins encoded by
the 20 selected genes, b) several principal regulators
of stemness and tumorigenicity in GSCs, c) reporters
of the signaling pathways relevant for GBM such as:
active CTNNB1 (ABC) (Wnt pathway), SHH and
GLI1 (Hedgehog pathway), MTOR (MTOR pathway),
DLL3 (Notch pathway) and STAT3 (Jak/stat pathway),

negative RNA-protein correlation (r = –0.35 ± 0.27). The
overall correlation for the entire set of 20 genes was r =
0.55 ± 0.41. The nine genes from gene cluster I exhibited
very high RNA-protein correlation (r = 0.75 ± 0.12).
To evaluate the potential functional association
between the proteins encoded by the 20 selected genes
and important signaling pathways in GSCs we used a
targeted proteomics approach (Figure 5A–5B). Through

d) proteins relevant for sub-classification of GBMs/
GSCs at the protein level [26] and e) the reporters of
growth factor signaling pathways (IGFBP5, PDGFB,
EGFR and NF1). In addition to the RPE values obtained
using seven GSC cultures and two NSC cultures, we
also included reciprocal values of PDT and the results
from functional assays (cell viability/XTT and sphere
forming assay) (Figure 5B). Hierarchical clustering
with distance matrix separated the tested proteins into
two classes: proteins up-regulated in GSCs (clusters 1,
2 and 3) and those down-regulated in GSCs (cluster 4)
(Figure 5B). Gene products of the nine genes in gene
cluster I were all up-regulated and co-expressed at the
protein level. From these, six proteins (CENPA, DLG7,
KIF15, KIF18A, EZH2 and DEPDC1) were highly
co-expressed and were arranged within protein cluster
1 together with signaling pathway reporters such as
MTOR, pSTAT3 (Ser727), DLL3 and PDGFB (Figure
5B). PBK was co-expressed with EGFR and PDGFR
(protein cluster 2) while the expression levels of CDC6
and HMMR correlated with one another and with the
expression of the stemness marker SOX2 (protein
cluster 3). In addition, the expression levels of reporters
of the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways correlated
positively with levels of nestin, sphere forming ability
and PDT (protein cluster 2).
To investigate whether the results of the targeted
proteomics can be confirmed by other means, we searched
the COGNOSCENTE database (http://vanburenlab.medicine.
tamhsc.edu/cognoscente.shtml) that contains information
about biomolecular interactions based on experimental
evidence. The interactions between molecules represented in
this database included protein-protein, protein-DNA, proteinRNA and genetic interactions. In this analysis, we included
proteins used in targeted proteomics (Figure 6, Table  2,
Supplementary Figure S8). Analysis of protein cluster 1
(Figure 5B) revealed that MTOR might be functionally
related to CENPA and EZH2 with whom it shared three
and four common interactants respectively. DLL3 was
interconnected with EZH2 and KIF18A via NRF1. STAT3
was interconnected with EZH2 via 13 common interactants,
with CENPA via SRRT, with DLG7 via SUMO2 and with
DEPDC1 via transcription factor ELAVL1. CENPA and
EZH2 were connected via HIST1H1A while DLG7 and
EZH2 shared one common interactant CDK1. Furthermore
MTOR, STAT3, EZH2, DEPDC1, KIF15, KIF18A and
DLG7 were all interconnected via ubiquitin C (UBC).
Analysis of protein cluster 2 (Figure 5B) showed that EGFR
was interconnected with PBK via 11 common interactants
(Table 2) and with RHBDD1 via FBXO25 and UBC. In
protein cluster III SOX2 shared common interactants with
CDC6, HMMR and MPP6. NF1 was connected with MPP6
via SMARCA4 while NRF1 bound NF1, MPP6 and HMMR.
Furthermore NF1, FNDC3B, HMMR, MPP6 and CDC6
were all interconnected via UBC.

To investigate if the proteins encoded by the 20
selected genes interact with each other across the protein
clusters and whether they build a network, we searched
the COGNOSCENTE database again. This analysis
revealed that proteins encoded by the 14 candidate
genes (PBK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7,
KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR, MPP6, RHBDD1, FNDC3B,
MCC, and FAM118A) were functionally interconnected
and built a protein interaction network (Figure 6, Table 2,
Supplementary Figure S8). Among these, we detected six
genes (PBK, CENPA, CDC6, EZH2, MPP6 and MCC),
whose gene products interacted with a high number of
proteins and qualify to be called high degree nodes or
“hubs”. KIF15, HMMR and DLG7 were also highly
interconnected within this network. EZH2 and CDC6
were connected via CDK2, CDK6, RBL2, and UBB.
MCC interacted with DLG7 via APP and with HMMR via
CSNK1E. HMMR was further connected with CENPA
via ACTB. PBK was interconnected with CENPA, KIF15,
CDC6, HMMR, DLG7 and EZH2 (Table 2).
We also analyzed known interactions between
the proteins encoded by the 20 selected genes and two
known key players that regulate growth and development
of GSCs, namely BMI1 and HIF1A (Figure 6 and
Supplementary Figure S8). HIF1A interacted with EZH2
via seven interactants. Five of the interactants were
also shared between EZH2 and STAT3. HIF1A further
interacted with CDC6, MPP6, HMMR, MCC, CENPA,
PBK and DLG7. BMI1 both bound CENPA and interacted
with it via seven interactants. BMI1 both bound CDC6
and interacted with it via ATM. BMI1 further interacted
with PBK, EZH2, KIF15, DLG7 and MPP6. BMI directly
regulated expression of ELAVL1 that further directly
regulated expression of DEPDC1 and FNDC3B.
We also looked into interactions between the
proteins encoded by the 20 selected genes and products of
SOX2, OLIG2, POU3F2 and SALL2 that were recently
identified as a core set of transcriptional factors essential
for neurodevelopment and GBM propagation [27]. All
four proteins were part of the same network (Table 2,
Supplementary Figure S9).
One of the proteins central to the network was
ubiquitin C (UBC) that bound 11 proteins encoded by the
following genes: PBK, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7,
KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR, MPP6, RHBDD1 and FNDC3B
(Figure 6, Supplementary Figures S8–S9) as well as with
products of BMI1, MTOR, STAT3, HIF1A, EGFR, NF1,
POU3F2 and SALL2. Another interconnecting protein
was encoded by nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and
bound 5 proteins (EZH2, HMMR, KIF18A, MPP6 and
FAM118A) as well as DLL3 and NF1. Cyclin-dependent
kinase 1 (CDK1) bound four proteins (PBK, CDC6, DLG7
and EZH2), while beta actin (ACTB) and retinoblastoma
binding protein 4 (RBBP4) bound three proteins each.
ACTB bound PBK, CENPA and HMMR while RBBP4

that 15 genes were significantly up-regulated at the protein level in all tested GSC cultures, including CENPA, DLG7, PBK, FILIPL1,
DEPDC1, NOL4, CDC6, KIF15, MPP6, KIF18A, EZH2, HMMR, FAM118A, FNDC3B and MDM1. RHBDD1 was up-regulated at the
protein level in some of the GSC cultures while MCC and RAPGEF4 were clearly down-regulated at the protein level even though their
RNA expression levels were significantly higher in GSCs. This analysis was performed in two to four NSC (not all shown) and seven
GSC cultures. The observed sizes in kDa are indicated. The expected protein sizes, quantification of the observed bands and additional

of the known signaling pathways and proteins relevant for sub-classification of GBM at the protein level [26] were also included (western
images of the reporters are shown in A, panel to the right). In addition to the western data, the results of the functional assays were quantified
and added to the protein dataset. The sphere forming assay and PDT values are presented as normalized values (0–1, 1 being the highest
sphere forming ability, 0 being the number of spheres in NSCs) and reciprocal values (1/n), respectively. The nine proteins (corresponding

of stemness, growth and tumorigenicity in GSCs. By querying the COGNESCENTE database we obtained information on proteinprotein interactions documented in the literature. Fourteen of the proteins encoded by the selected 20 genes were interconnected and built a
network. Several of these (PBK, CENPA, CDC6, EZH2, MPP6 and MCC) were highly interconnected and could be called network “hubs”.

CDC6 and HIF1A and was functionally related to KIF18A

RAPGEF4 and NOL4 were not part of this network but

Increased protein levels for a set of the selected

there were significant differences in the subcellular

used principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis
showed that our sets of NSCs and GSCs clustered together
with other NSCs and GSCs from the GEO database
(Figure 8). The first principal component (PC) separated
leucocytes from all other cell types. The second PC
separated GSCs from differentiated neurons. GSCs were
only partially separated from NSCs and BCC.
The GEO data sets were also used to compare
expression of the nine potential target genes in GSCs,
astrocytes, DA-neurons, iPS-derived neurons, iPS cells
and ESCs (Supplementary Figure S11). Eight genes (all
except EZH2) showed reduced expression in astrocytes
when compared to GSCs. Although the trend was
similar for all eight genes, statistical significance was
not reached in all tests (probably due to the small sample
sizes). Eight genes (all except EZH2) showed reduced
expression in neurons when compared to GSCs. Also
here the trend was similar for all eight genes although

DISCUSSION

statistical significance was not reached in all tests. The
expression of all genes, except CDC6, was relatively
high in ESCs. The expression of DEPDC1 and HMMR
was significantly higher in ESCs than in GSCs. The
expression of HMMR and DLG7 was significantly higher
in iPS cells than in GSCs.

It has been shown that GSCs are involved in
GBM development and resistance to therapy [13–15].
Hence, there is a strong rationale to target these cells as
a therapeutic strategy. By comparing the gene expression

levels in NSCs and GSCs, we previously identified a
30-gene signature and pathways that are differentially
regulated between these two cell types [19]. In the
work presented here, we focused on identifying genes
suitable for therapeutic targeting. Filtering of microarray
expression data identified 20 potentially interesting genes
consistently expressed in GSCs and consistently not
expressed in NSCs. These preliminary data were then
verified by experimental and bioinformatics means.
The present study identified a set of 20 genes that
does not overlap with the 30 genes from our previous
study [19]. In the latter investigation we aimed for genes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

highly up-regulated in GSCs with less consideration for
their absolute expression levels in NSCs. In the current
study we selected genes not expressed in NSCs and
consistently expressed in GSCs.
Unlike many studies using brain tissue as a control,
we used NSCs isolated from different areas of the adult
human brain. Altogether we used 16 GSC and nine NSC
cultures. To our knowledge, few reports have used such
a high number of primary stem cell cultures to identify
and verify candidate genes. While GSCs were propagated
as spheres, the NSCs used for the validation experiments
were cultured under three different sets of conditions,
26207

which reinforced the robustness of our findings. Both GSC
cultures and the controls (NSC and NFC cultures) were
properly matched with regard to state of differentiation
and cell PDT (Figure 2). Although many of the selected
20 genes are involved in cell cycle or cell division, their
expression was not altered in NSCs cultured in alternative
growth conditions and with different cell proliferation
rates (Supplementary Figures S3, S4 and S5).
To ensure a broader validity, we utilized
microarrays, qPCR, immunolabeling, western blot and
targeted proteomics in combination with public database
mining and finally identified nine candidate genes (PBK,
CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7, KIF18A,
EZH2, and HMMR) whose expression was confirmed
using all experimental and bioinformatics verification
methods (Table 1). Simultaneous up-regulation of these
genes correlated negatively with patient survival in the
mesenchymal GBM subtype (TCGA) (Figure 4C). Our
multifaceted analysis further showed that the increased
expression of the selected genes was characteristic of
GSCs and not caused by variations in growth conditions,
proliferation rates or differentiation state. It is also
interesting that the set of the selected genes exhibited
significantly higher expression levels in GBM compared
to LGG, suggesting a dose-response relationship.
FNDC3B was identified as a predictor of survival in LGG
(Supplementary Figure S6). We found good correlation
between mRNA and the corresponding protein expression
for the selected 20 genes (r = 0.55 ± 0.41) (Table 1), which
is of vital importance for downstream applications, such
as gene silencing and pre-clinical testing of potential
therapeutic targets, that rely on removal of not only the
transcripts but also the corresponding proteins.
The TCGA research network classified GBMs
into four molecular subtypes based on the tumor’s gene
expression patterns. Importantly, these subtypes were
shown to have different responses to chemotherapy, thus
emphasizing the clinical relevance of this classification
[24]. Expression analysis of 200 GBM tissue samples
from the TCGA database revealed that nine potential
target genes were co-expressed in all GBM subtypes
(Figure 3B). Previous studies have underlined the
proneural characteristics of GSCs [28, 29]. Here we
have shown that 11 out of the initial 20 selected genes,
all highly up-regulated in GSCs, had an overall proneural
character (Figure 3C). This is in keeping with results
from previous studies [28, 29]. The suggested nine target
genes were particularly up-regulated in the proneural
GBM tissue samples, but were not limited to this group
(Figure 3C). Furthermore, the majority of these were
highly co-expressed at protein level with the notch ligand
DLL3 (Figure 5B), which was previously identified as a
proneural tumor marker [29]. Interestingly, the expression
of these nine predominantly ‘proneural’ genes correlated
with the survival of mesenchymal GBM patients, thus
emphasizing the heterogeneity within the given GBM
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subtypes [30]. Alternatively, this could mean that
mesenchymal GBM tumors that exhibit certain proneural
features can be associated with worse prognosis.
Prior to the present study, six of the nine potential
molecular targets (EZH2, CDC6, PBK, KIF18A, HMMR
and DLG7) were shown to be up-regulated in GBM
[31–35], thus underscoring the relevance of our study.
One study identified PBK, DLG7, and KIF18A as upregulated in GBM and classified them as mitosis, DNA
replication, and chromosome (MRC) organization genes
[34]. However, only the roles of EZH2 and HMMR have
been extensively studied in GBM and GSCs [31, 35]. EZH2
has been identified as one of the key players in GBM and
its increased expression correlates with a poor clinical
outcome [31, 33]. HMMR has recently been suggested as
a potential therapeutic target in GSCs [35]. HMMR is also
involved in cell division [36] and is implicated in myelomas
[37, 38] and breast cancer [39]. CDC6 binds BMI1, which
is a known regulatory factor in GBM [40]. PBK, a serine/
threonine kinase, is functionally related to the AKT pathway
and can regulate cell cycle [41, 42]. Besides being a stem
cell-related gene, DLG7 also regulates KIF18A localization
in the cell [43, 44]. The other genes have not previously
been associated with GBM, although some have been
linked to other cancers. For example centromere protein A
(CENPA), is involved in cell division and is functionally
related to several genes involved in GBM and cancer
in general [34, 45]. DEP domain containing 1 protein
(DEPDC1), has been implicated in bladder carcinogenesis
[46] and in invasion/metastasis through the actions of
p53 and p63 [47]. Recently, a cancer peptide vaccine has
been used to target this protein [48]. Thus, it appears that
almost all of the suggested nine target genes are directly
or indirectly connected to cell cycle and/or cell division, in
keeping with previous findings [19, 33, 34].
By querying the COGNOSCENTE database that
visualizes known protein-protein interactions, we found
that proteins encoded by 14 of our candidate genes,
including the nine genes whose increased expression in
GSCs has been confirmed by all methods (PBK, CENPA,
KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6, DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2,
and HMMR) were all part of the same protein-protein
interaction network (Figure 6). This analysis revealed
that PBK, CENPA, CDC6, EZH2, MPP6 and MCC were
highly interconnected and represented so called “hubs”.
Until now only EZH2 was recognized as a hub gene [33].
We have previously analyzed the expression of
several signaling pathways known to be important in GSCs
[19]. Many signaling pathways operate through protein
modifications and are not always easily detected through
mRNA analysis. Using targeted proteomics we calculated
the degree of linear dependence (Pearson) between the
expression levels of the proteins encoded by the 20 selected
genes and the reporters of several cellular signaling
pathways. This assembled proteins encoded by the selected
genes and reporters of signaling pathways into three protein

clusters. At the protein level, the increased expression of
CENPA, DLG7, EZH2, KIF18A, DEPDC1, KIF15, NOL4
and FAM118A from protein cluster 1 positively correlated
with the increment in levels of MTOR, DLL3 (Notch),
PDGFB and STAT3. The same applied to protein cluster 2,
where expression levels of PBK and RHBDD1 correlated
with those of EGFR and PDGFR, and cluster 3 where
expression levels of CDC6, MPP6, HMMR, FNDC3B,
MDM1 and MCC correlated with those of SOX2 and NF1.
Searching of the COGNOSCENTE database confirmed
the results of targeted proteomics and further supported
the notion that several proteins encoded by our candidate
genes are functionally related to reporters of known
signaling pathways in GBM. Due to the especially high
number of common interactants (indicated in brackets), it
is very probable that members of protein cluster 1: STAT3
and EZH2 (13), MTOR and CENPA (3) and MTOR and
EZH2 (4), are functionally related. It has been shown
previously that EZH2 binds to and methylates STAT3 in
GSCs [49]. We also found that KIF18A and EZH2 shared
common interactants with DLL3 and that DLG7, DEPDC1
and CENPA shared common interactants with STAT3. In
cluster 2, PBK and RHBDD1 were both connected to EGFR
through 11 and one common interactants, respectively.
A link between PBK and EGFR has not been reported in
GBM, although a functional relationship has been observed
in other cancers [50]. In cluster 3 SOX2 and NF1 were
connected to all four proteins CDC6, HMMR, MCC and
MPP6 through shared interactants. The NF1 gene encoding
neurofibromin 1, is identified as a GBM suppressor gene
that also defines the mesenchymal subtype of GBM [24].
It has recently been shown that the expression of HMMR
correlated with the expression of the stemness marker
SOX2 in GSCs [35]. Our results are in agreement with
these studies. A search of the COGNOSCENTE database
also revealed that CENPA both bound BMI1 and interacted
with it indirectly through seven shared interactants. BMI1
bound CDC6, while HIF1A might be functionally related
with EZH2, CDC6 and MPP6 with whom it shared seven,
three and two common interactants respectively.
In addition to linking our candidate genes to reporters
of signaling pathways and genes known to be important
for GBM, we also identified several other genes that were
highly interconnected within the network (Figure 6). UBC
bound 11 of our proteins in addition to six of the reporters.
The components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
have already been evaluated as potential anti-cancer targets
[51]. Another factor, NRF1, connected five proteins from
our list (EZH2, HMMR, KIF18A, MPP6 and FAM118A)
to one another and to DLL3 and NF1. It was previously
reported that the expression of CDC6 was regulated by this
transcription factor [52]. In addition to regulating expression
of genes involved in mitochondrial function, NRF1 also
binds a number of genes involved in cell cycle control [52].
This study further showed that NRF1 cooperates with E2F4
and other E2F family members to regulate expression of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

genes involved in cellular proliferation. Interestingly, PBK
binds the transcription factor E2F4 which itself binds to a cis
region of the CDC6 gene (Figure 6).
We previously identified a 30-gene signature that
was highly up-regulated in high-grade gliomas [19]. These
findings were compared to the current set of selected genes.
The cumulative querying of the COGNOSCENTE database
using proteins from both lists showed several shared
protein-protein interactions (Supplementary Figure S10).
PBK bound CCNB1 while CENPA bound SHCBP1.
ELAVL1 that bound RNA of seven genes from both lists
seems to play a central role in this bigger network together
with UBC, CDC6, E2F4, MYC and NRF1.
Global analysis of 134 microarrays showed that
the GSCs and NSCs from this study clustered together
with the GSCs and NSCs from other studies (Figure 8).
Although all GSC cultures clustered together, the PCA
could not separate clearly between GSCs, NSCs and BCC.
However GSCs were separated from more differentiated
cell types like neurons.
Our analysis showed that the sphere-forming ability
and reciprocal values of cell PDT correlated best to each
other and to levels of nestin, GFAP, TUBB3, the short
variant of p-Ser727-STAT3 (unannotated), and Hedgehog
and canonical Wnt signaling (Figure 6). It has been shown
that Shh regulates the self-renewal of mouse stem cells
[53], whereas Wnt signaling stimulates proliferation and
suppresses differentiation of several types of stem cells
including NSCs and GSCs [54, 55]. Our current results
are in agreement with this and our previous findings [19].
We believe that the value of our study lies not only
in the identification of nine important genes and potential
therapeutic targets (PBK, CENPA, KIF15, DEPDC1, CDC6,
DLG7, KIF18A, EZH2, and HMMR) in GSCs, but also in the
range of independent methods used to verify the results. Gene
knockdowns of EZH2 and HMMR already revealed that
these two genes are essential for survival of GSCs and thus
very promising new molecular targets for treatment of GBM
[31, 35]. We are currently working on gene knockdowns of
several genes from the presented list and have recently shown
that targeting PBK/TOPK decreases growth and survival of
glioma initiating cells in vitro and attenuates tumor growth in
vivo [56]. Although the significance of the residual candidate
genes remains to be determined, we clearly show that they
are dysregulated in GSCs, important for patient survival and
part of the same protein-protein network, which is shared
with some of the principal genes that regulate GSC growth
and tumorigenicity.

criteria were obtained from patients undergoing surgical
treatment at Oslo University Hospital in accordance with
the appropriate Institutional Review Boards [57]. Normal
brain tissue (SVZ, white matter and hippocampus) was
harvested from human temporal lobes removed due
to refractory epilepsy. The age, diagnosis and survival
of the patients participating in this study can be found
in Supplementary Table S3. Surgical biopsies were
enzymatically and mechanically dissociated and TrypsinEDTA (Gibco, Life Technologies, NYC, NY, USA)
was added for enzymatic dissociation. Subsequently,
2 mg/ml human albumin (Octapharma pharmazeutika
produktionges, Vienna, Austria) was used to block the
Trypsin effect and the cells were washed in L-15 (Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) before being plated in serum-free
neurosphere medium containing 10 ng/ml bFGF and
20 ng/ml EGF (both R&D Inc., Minneapolis, MN,
USA), B27-supplement (1:50, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), 100 U/ml Penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza),
1 ng/ml Heparin (Leo Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark) and
8 mM Hepes (Lonza) in Dulbecco’s modified essential
medium with nutrient mix F-12 and Glutamax (DMEM/
F12, Invitrogen). The cells were cultured in 75 cm2 nontreated flasks (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of
105 cells/ml and supplemented with EGF and bFGF twice
a week. GSC cultures were characterized for the following
stemness markers: CD133, SSEA-1/CD15, CD44, CD166
and A2B5. GSC cultures were orthotopically xenografted
to confirm tumor initiation properties [8, 56, 58, 59]
(Mughal et al., in revision, Mughal et al., in prep).
NFCs (ReNcell VM Human Neural Progenitor Cell
Line, SCC008, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany)
were cultured as spheres in serum-free Neurobasal
A medium (Gibco) containing B27 (Gibco), 2 mM
L-glutamine, 10 ng/ml bFGF, and 20 ng/ml EGF (both
from R&D Systems). Adherent NSCs were cultured in
a modified neurosphere medium containing 1% FBS,
10 ng/ml bFGF and 20 ng/ml TGFα (AD1% medium) [22].
NSCs on RN were first incubated adherently in AD1%
medium for one passage and were thereafter incubated on
RN (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) in serum-free Neurobasal A
medium (the same medium as for NFCs).

(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. A list of oligonucleotides used in this work can
be found in Supplementary Table S4. Crossing point (CP)
values (Supplementary Figure S1B) were generated using
second-derivative calculation software (SDS2.2). Relative
expression levels were calculated using 2−ΔΔCT method and
REST software [61]. Each GSC sample included at least
three replicates (often different passages). The expression
values for each gene were normalized to at least two
house-keeping genes. The Relative Gene Expression
values in GSCs (RE-GSC) for the 20 selected genes in
Figure 1C were calculated using multiple controls (values
obtained for all tested NSCs and NFCs) as reference. For
expression analysis of FNDC3B we also used Taqman
Probes: Hs00384650_m1 and Hs00981550 (Applied
Biosystems).

Western blot and targeted proteomics
Protein expression was analyzed in seven GSC and
two to four NSC cultures. The cells were homogenized
by triturating in Cell Extraction Buffer (Mammalian
Cell Extraction Kit, Biovision, Milpitas, CA, USA) and
centrifuged through a QIAshredder (Qiagen, Germantown,
MD, USA). A total of 20–40 μg of whole protein extract
was mixed with the loading buffer (NuPAGE; Life
Technologies) and loaded onto a 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gel (Life Technologies). Protein gels were blotted
onto 0.45-μm PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS/0.1% Tween
20 (TBST; Life Technologies) and probed with primary
antibodies diluted in the same solution. The primary
antibodies, obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies
(Danvers, MA, USA), were incubated in bovine serum
albumin according to the recommended procedures.
The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated antirabbit/mouse/goat/rat IgGs (1:10000). For a complete
list of antibodies and the working concentrations, see
Supplementary Table S5. The blots were developed using
the Lumiglo Reserve CL Substrate kit (KLP, Gaithersburg,
MD, USA), and detected using the Epi Chemi II Darkroom
(Ultraviolet Laboratory Products, Upland, CA, USA). For
targeted proteomics the relative protein expression (RPE)
values were calculated as follows: the intensities of the
protein bands from western blot were quantified using
Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA, USA), background
subtracted and normalized to the background subtracted
intensities of the corresponding β-actin (ACTB) bands.
To investigate the degree of linear dependence between
the expression levels at the transcript and protein levels
we compared the qPCR data to the quantified western
data (RPE values) using the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient (PPMCC r) calculation (Table 1).
For hierarchical clustering of RPE values we used
J-Express (Molmine, Bergen, Norway). This analysis was
performed using Pearson correlation as a distance metric.

RNA isolation and real-time quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and the concentration was determined with
a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. For cDNA synthesis,
experimental set up and oligonucleotide design, we
used the procedure previously described [60]. cDNA
was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using a QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). qPCR was performed
on an ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies, Foster City, Ca, USA) using SYBR Premix
Ex Taq™ (Takara, Otsu, Japan) or Taqman probes

Immunolabeling and confocal microscopy

TCGA: The gene expression data (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp) are based on
tissue samples from 598 GBMs and 10 normal samples
(Supplementary Figure S6C). The results obtained for
GBM could be published without restrictions. The Cox
proportional hazards model was used to correlate gene
expression data to survival. Both univariate (individual
genes) and multivariate models (several genes) were
investigated. Based on a fitted Cox model, patients were
divided into either a good or a bad prognosis group.
Differences in (actual) survival between the prognostic
groups were evaluated in terms of a log rank test.
For Figure 4: Survival/expression data (200 GBMs)
[24] were downloaded from https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/docs/publications/gbm_exp/ and processed using
J-Express (Molmine) for hierarchical clustering. Patient
survival was calculated using Prism 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla,
CA, USA).
For Figure 6: For construction of the protein
interaction networks we used the COGNOSCENTE
database (http://vanburenlab.tamhsc.edu/cognoscente.
html) that enables visualization of biomolecular
interaction documented in the literature. The gene P2RY5
was not in the database while there were no interactions
found for FILIP1L. Due to complexity of the network only
the protein-protein interactions concerning the 20 selected
proteins, BMI1 and HIF1A are presented (Figure 6 and
Supplementary Figure S8). Some of the additional proteinprotein interactions discussed in the text that are not
included in Supplementary Figures S8–S10 can be easily
reproduced by querying the COGNOSCENTE database.
For Figure 8: PCA analysis was calculated using R,
version 3.1.2. The following sets of microarrays were
downloaded from the GEO database, quantile normalized
and used for this analysis: NSC and GSC cultures and
GBM tissues from: H91, H95, H80, NFCs, T65, T08,
TC3, TC4, T96, T11 and T59 (encompassed in the GEO
sets GSE60705, GSE53800 and GSE41467) in addition to
iPS, neurons, iPS-derived neurons, astrocytes, fibroblasts,
NSCs, NFCs, breast cancer cells (BCC, cancer stem cells
and cell lines), leucocytes, brain tissue, GBM, ESCs,
gliomas cell lines and many additional sets of GSCs
[encompassed in the GEO sets GSE41468, GSE34987,
GSE36426 (GSCs), GSE42133, GSE43364, GSE43452,
GSE43903, GSE47515, GSE42265, GSE32658,
GSE37077, GSE41565 and GSE36102]. NSC cultures
from patients: H91, H95, H80 were represented by
samples from HPC, SVZ, WM and GM and were grown
either as spheres or in AD1% medium.

GBM tissue samples were fixed in 4% PFA,
cryoprotected in 20% sucrose and frozen in OCT (TissueTEK, Sakura Finetek, CA, USA). The blocks were cryosectioned and immunolabeling was performed as previously
described [62, 63]. Cells were grown overnight on tissuechamber slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) on RN (Takara)
washed in PBS and fixed for 15 min in 4% PFA in PBS. The
immunolabeling procedure was then performed following
the procedure used for tissue sections. The complete list of
antibodies can be found in Supplementary Table S6. Confocal
images were acquired with an Olympus FV1000 confocal
laser scanning microscope. To estimate the percentage of cells
(Figure 2) 150–200 cells in at least five different microscope
fields were counted using ImageJ (NIH, USA).

Functional assays
Sphere-forming assay
Sphere-forming ability was measured by plating 500
cells/well in 200 μl neurosphere medium in 96-well plates.
After 10 days, the plates were scanned using GelCount
(Oxford-Optronix, Oxford, UK) and the sphere colonies
were quantified using GelCount software.
Cell population doubling time (PDT)
We used the following formula: PDT = t log 2 / log
Nt- log No where t = time period, Nt = number of cells at
time t and No = initial number of cells.

Bioinformatics and data mining
The initial selection of the 20 candidate genes was
performed using excel-based analysis of 32875 transcripts
from the array data set GSE31262 [19]. By filtering the
log-transformed gene expression data, we selected 20
genes whose RNA expression levels on the logarithmic
scale were below zero in the NSC cultures and above zero
in GSC cultures.
REMBRANDT: Microarray data from the
Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (National
Cancer Institute. 2005. REMBRANDT home page http://
rembrandt.nci.nih.gov were accessed on May the 15th
2012. The repository contained 249 microarrays of GBM
grade IV patients and 66 microarrays of Astrocytoma grade
II patients. The microarrays were from the Affymetrix
Gene Chip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform.
The R/Bioconductor package Robust Multiarray Average
(RMA) [64, 65] was used for pre-processing of the data.
The selected 20 genes were represented by 48 different
probes in the Affymetrix arrays. For each probe we fitted
an univariate logistic regression model, with GBM/lowgrade as (a dichotomous) response and the gene expression
values as explanatory variables. P-values from the logistic
regression were corrected for multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [66].
