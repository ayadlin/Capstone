ABSTRACT
Onconase is a ribonuclease that presents both antitumor and antiviral properties
linked to its ribonucleolytic activity and represents a new class of RNA-damaging
drugs. It has reached clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers and human
papilloma virus warts. Onconase targets different RNAs in the cell cytosol but
Onconase-treated cells present features that are different from a simple arrest of
protein synthesis. We have used microarray-derived transcriptional profiling to
identify Onconase-regulated genes in two ovarian cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR-RES
and OVCAR-8). RT-qPCR analyses have confirmed the microarray findings. We have
identified a network of up-regulated genes implicated in different signaling pathways
that may explain the cytotoxic effects exerted by Onconase. Among these genes,
activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a central role in the key events triggered
by Onconase in treated cancer cells that finally lead to apoptosis. This mechanism,
mediated by ATF3, is cell-type independent. Up-regulation of ATF3 may also explain
the antiviral properties of this ribonuclease because this factor is involved in halting
viral genome replication, keeping virus latency or preventing viral oncogenesis.
Finally, Onconase-regulated genes are different from those affected by nucleardirected ribonucleases.

entered clinical trials for the treatment of different types
of cancer and has reached phase II/III for the treatment of
malignant mesothelioma [7–9].
The ONC-induced apoptotic effects linked to its cell
internalization mechanism are still not well understood.
It is believed that the normal route for ONC to reach
the cytosol is through an endosomal compartment, but
controversy exists about the existence of a cellular receptor
[6]. Once in the cytosol, ONC degrades RNA, thereby
preventing protein synthesis and inducing cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis. However, ONC-induced apoptosis presents
features different from those of indiscriminate protein
synthesis arrest (for a review see [6]). In this regard, it
has been demonstrated that, besides rRNA, the initially
proposed ONC target [10], mRNAs [11, 12], tRNAs [13],
and miRNAs or their precursors [14–16] are also ONC
targets. Accordingly, ONC up- and down-regulates genes
that code for proteins involved in cell cycle progression or
transcription factors involved in cell survival [11, 12, 17].

INTRODUCTION
Onconase (ONC), a protein of amphibian origin, is a
member of the vertebrate secreted ribonucleases (RNases)
family that presents antitumor and antiviral activities.
Its structure endows it with unusual high conformation
stability [1] and with the ability to evade the cytoplasmic
ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), a 50kDa protein that tightly
binds to some RNases and inhibits their activity [2]. Both
its conformational stability and its ability to evade the RI
provide ONC with significant intracellular survival that is
critical to its biological actions.
Regarding the antitumor activity, it has been shown
that ONC exhibits selective cytostatic and cytotoxic
activities [3] against many human tumor models (for
a review see [4, 5]). In addition, ONC presents synergy
with a significant number of anti-tumor drugs, such as
tamoxifen, lovastatin, cisplatin, and vincristine, among
others (for a review see [6]). More interestingly, it has

In addition, ONC may trigger cell death in several ways,
depending on the cell type. It may induce caspase-dependent
apoptosis linked to the activation of the stress-activated
protein kinase c-Jun NH2 [18] or intrinsic apoptosis
together with the activation of Ser-proteases [19, 20]. It has
been demonstrated that intrinsic apoptosis depends on Apaf1 reversing the inhibitory effect of tRNAs on the association
of cytochrome c with Apaf-1 [21]. In addition, ONC may
induce cell death by autophagy [22, 23].
The antiviral activity of ONC is of particular interest
due to ONC’s ability to degrade not only RNA but dsRNA
[24]. Antiviral drugs that destroy viral genomes not only
suppress virus production but are likely to abolish latent
virus infection. It has been described that ONC exhibits
efficacy in suppressing the replication of HIV-1, leaving
non-infected cells unharmed [25]. Recently, several
patents have been obtained by Tamir Biotechnology, Inc.
(San Diego, CA) (http://tamirbio.com/) to use wild type
ONC and variants as antiviral agents. The most success
has been obtained with human papilloma virus (HPV)
[26], although other viral infections, such as those of the
Herpesviridae family, are also being treated [27]. ONC
is now in clinical trial to study its safety and efficacy
by topical administration to treat genital warts (clinical
trial identifier: NCT02535104 at https://clinicaltrials.
gov/). What is more, ONC is being considered alone
or as adjuvant therapy in an effort to fight Ebola,
orthomyxoviruses (influenza), Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the
cytomegalovirus (CMV), the respiratory syncytial virus
(RVS), and rhabodviruses (rabies) (http://tamirbio.com/).
Taking into account the large number of diseases with
high social impact that are or can be treated with ONC, we
have used microarray technology to identify significant
altered gene expression in the treatment of two ovarian
carcinoma cell lines, NCI/ADR-RES and its parental
OVCAR-8, with this enzyme. The present work is the
second to use microarray-derived transcriptional profiling
to identify ONC-regulated genes in order to understand the
cytotoxic mechanism of this RNase. In a previous work,
Altomare et al. [12] investigated the effect of ONC on
different human malignant mesothelioma (hMM) cell lines
and showed that this RNase alters the expression of genes
that control the cell cycle and apoptosis.
Our results show that the ONC up-regulated
activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a cell-type
independent key factor of ONC antitumor activity. ATF3
activates other transcription factors that control different
signaling pathways. This explains the effects observed
in the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis in cells
treated with ONC. Interestingly, it has been described that
ATF3 and some of its regulated genes help to preclude
viral genome replication, to maintain virus latency, or to
prevent viral oncogenesis. Finally, our results also show
that the pleiotropic effects caused by ONC, derived from
its ribonucleolytic activity in the cytosol, are completely
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

different from those promoted by nuclear-directed RNases
(ND-RNases) [28].

RESULTS
ONC is a paradigmatic antitumor RNase whose
cytotoxic mechanism has been studied by different means
[6]. Nevertheless, microarray profiling to broadly analyze
the genes affected by this drug has only been done in
hMM cell lines [12]. We have used the same approach
to study the effects of ONC in two ovarian carcinoma
cell lines, NCI/ADR-RES and its parental OVCAR-8.
In addition, our results allow us to compare the effects
on gene expression promoted by two different RNases in
cancer cells: ONC, an RNase that exerts its action in the
cytosol, and PE5, an ND-RNase [29].

Cell proliferation and RNase sensitivity
Since ONC has ribonucleolytic activity, an unbiased
approach to examine gene expression by microarray
technology requires searching for optimal cell treatment
conditions. An RNA population representative of the actual
drug effect must be obtained, not one that results from
an extensive RNA degradation caused by the apoptosis
process [30]. Therefore, we investigated the cytotoxic
effect of ONC on NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cells
at different ONC concentrations and incubation times, as
we had previously done with PE5 [28]. A dose-dependent
cytotoxic effect was apparent after 24 h of incubation with
ONC and increased with time (Supplementary Figure 1
Supplementary Data). As expected [31], the cytotoxic
effect of ONC was greater than that of PE5 [28], and the
MDR cell line, NCI/ADR-RES, was less sensitive to both
RNases than its parental cell line OVCAR-8.
Next, we analyzed the RNA degradation caused by
different doses of ONC. We incubated NCI/ADR-RES and
OVCAR-8 cells with ONC concentrations that induced
a decrease in cell proliferation of 5%, 10%, and 15%
(IC5, IC10, and IC15). After 36 h of incubation, the RNA
degradation of treated and untreated cells was quantified
using a bioanalyzer. The RNA integrity number (RIN)
values obtained for all samples were higher than 9.3.
For a good comparison of the effects of ONC and PE5
on the NCI/ADR-RES cell line, we decided to carry out
the microarray experiments at that concentration of ONC
that triggered the same decrease in cell viability (10%)
observed with PE5 [28] after 36 h of treatment (i.e. 0.5
μM). Likewise, we chose an ONC concentration for the
OVCAR-8 cell line of 0.06 μM, which also produced a
10% decrease in cell proliferation.

Gene expression changes in ONC-treated cells
ONC-treated and untreated NCI/ADR-RES cells
revealed 56 differentially expressed genes out of 35,377
11693

present in the microarray (1.6 x 10-3 %). Among them,
89% were up-regulated (the increase from untreated
cells ranged from 2- to 6.5-fold), whereas 11% were
down-regulated (the decrease from untreated cells ranged
from 2- to 2.5-fold). Table 1 shows the top 20 ONC upregulated genes as well as all the ONC down-regulated
genes. The results indicate that the primary effect of
ONC in NCI/ADR-RES cells is the activation of gene
expression. ONC up-regulated genes are involved in
transcription regulation (ATF3, CREB5, EGR1), cell
cycle and apoptosis (GADD45A, PPP1R15A), immune
response (IL6, IL33, IL1RL1, IL23A), and stress response
(TXNIP), among other processes. Some of the upregulated genes act as tumor suppressors (TXNIP, EGR1,
and PPP1R15A). ONC down-regulated genes are also
associated with transcription regulation (RDBP, XBP1),
amino acid metabolism (PHGDH, ASNS), and protein
folding (HSPA1A, HSPA8).
ONC-treated and untreated OVCAR-8 cells revealed
seven differentially expressed genes out of 35,377 present
in the microarray (1.8 x 10-4 %). All of them were upregulated (the increase from untreated cells ranged from
2- to 4-fold) (Table 2), indicating that the primary effect
of ONC is also gene expression activation. Again, some
of the up-regulated genes are related to transcription
regulation (ATF3, NEURL3, ZNF750), while others are
involved in stress response (TXNIP). Six out of the seven
ONC differentially expressed genes in the OVCAR-8 cell
line were also differentially expressed in the NCI/ADRRES cell line (TXNIP, ATF3, HIST1H2AC, NEURL3,
DHRS2, and NPPB).
Among the ONC and PE5 differentially expressed
genes in the NCI/ADR-RES cell line, we identified only
10 that were common for both RNase treatments (i.e. 1.5%
and 18% of the PE5 [28] and ONC differentially expressed
genes, respectively). Eight of them were up-regulated in
RNase-treated cells respective to untreated cells, whereas
the other two were down-regulated. Common up-regulated
genes are related to transcription regulation (HMBOX1,
LINC00340, NEXN-AS1), immune response (CD86, IL6,
IFIT2) and the last two are potential tumor suppressors
(LRRC2 and SPINK6 [32, 33]). Common down-regulated
genes participate in amino acid metabolism (PHGDH,
ASNS).

and RTA values obtained for untreated cells, were similar
to those found in the microarray analysis (Figure 1),
confirming that the microarray experiments are fully valid.

Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway
annotation
To better understand the functional relevance
of ONC-regulated genes in NCI/ADR-RES cells, we
performed a gene ontology analysis. To the same end,
ONC differentially expressed genes were mapped to the
KEGG database to find over-represented known metabolic
and regulatory pathways. These analyses were not done
for the OVCAR-8 cell line because ONC-treatment
gave only 10 differentially expressed genes. The NCI/
ADR-RES differentially expressed genes were used to
find over-represented gene ontology terms in the three
broad ontology categories: “molecular function”, which
captures knowledge about the functional activity of gene
products, the larger “biological process”, as part of which
these specific functions collectively act, and “cellular
component”, where all this occurs. Gene ontology analysis
shows that ONC differentially expressed genes (Table 3)
are involved in a diversity of cellular events. The same
was found for PE5, showing that these RNA-damaging
drugs have pleiotropic effects [28].
The most ONC-affected biological processes were
cell proliferation, response to stress, signal transduction,
cell differentiation, and apoptosis. The individual function
of ONC-regulated genes favored cytokine activity, nucleic
acid binding transcription factor activity, and growth factor
activity, and were mainly associated with the extracellular
region, the cell surface, and the nucleus.
Analysis of the over-represented pathways
collected in the KEGG database showed that ONCaffected pathways (Table 3) were involved in growth and
development processes, like JAK-STAT or the MAPK
signaling pathway, which affect basic cellular functions
such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and
death, as well as stress response. Some pathways related
to infection or immunological diseases were also affected.

DISCUSSION
ONC cytotoxic mechanism

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of gene
expression

Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway
annotation of ONC-differentially expressed genes in
the NCI/ADR-RES cell line show interesting terms that
allow us to understand how ONC induces cell death.
These terms are cell proliferation, response to stress, and
apoptotic processes (Table 3). In these fields we can find
7 of the 20 most ONC up-regulated genes in NCI/ADRRES cells (Table 1) that correspond to functionally related
transcription regulators: early growth response 1 (EGR1),
activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), growth arrest and

mRNA expression of three ONC up-regulated
(TXNIP, ATF3, and GADD45A) and two down-regulated
(PHGDH, ASNS) genes, representatives of the processes
affected by this RNase, was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The
results are presented in Supplementary Figure 2 of the
Supplementary Data. Fold changes obtained with RTqPCR, calculated as the ratio between relative transcript
abundance (RTA) values obtained for ONC-treated cells

Gene information was taken from the UniProt database (European Bioinformatics, UK, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics,
Switzerland, Protein Information Resource, USA) (http://www.uniprot.org) and from the Entrez Gene database (National
Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene).
DNA-damage-inducible, alpha (GADD45A), thioredoxin
interacting protein (TXNIP), cAMP responsive element
binding protein 5 (CREB5), and protein phosphatase 1,
regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A). Their relationship is
depicted in Figure 2.
ATF3 is a member of the ATF/CREB family
of transcription factors that transduces signals from
various receptors to activate or repress gene expression.
Depending on the cell type and context it plays different
roles in cancer development [34]. Nevertheless, its ectopic
expression induces apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells
[35, 36], enhances the ability of different drugs, such
as camptothecin, etoposide, curcumin, cisplatin and
lovastatin, to induce apoptosis [37–40], and even inhibits
the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells [41–43]. ATF3
was first described as associated with ONC activity by
Altomare et al. [12]. Our results seem to indicate that it
plays a central role in the ONC action because it directly
up-regulates the expression of GADD45A [44] and
PPP1R15A [45]. Additionally, it can indirectly increase
TXNIP expression, since it promotes up-regulation of the
Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) [44], a transcription factor
whose overexpression in turn increases that of TXNIP
[46]. KLF6 is also up-regulated by ONC, although the
fold change is lower than 2. Moreover, ATF3 can bind
to CREB5 to form a heterodimer [47]. Although the
physiological significance of this dimer is not clear, the
general view is that its formation can alter DNA binding
specificity and transcriptional activity, thus expanding
the ability of this transcription factor to regulate gene
expression [34]. Finally, it is described that the expression
of ATF3 [48] and GADD45A [49] is increased by EGR1
(Figure 2). EGR1 is expressed at low levels in several
types of cancer [50–52], acting as a tumor suppressor and
inducing apoptosis of cancer cells in a p53-independent
manner [53]. It is interesting to note that ONC exerts its
cytotoxicity independently of the p53 phenotype [54].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GADD45A and PPP1R15A belong to the family
of growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) proteins,
which are crucial to cellular stress responses [55]. It is
known that GADD45A inhibits cell growth through the
G2/M cell cycle arrest [56, 57] while PPP1R15A plays a
vital role in promoting cell death following proteasome
inhibition via enhancing protein synthesis to activate
mechanisms associated with dead, including ER stress,
ROS production, and autophagy formation [58]. In
addition, down-regulation of GADD45A promoted by
the NF-κB transcription factor is essential for cancer cell
survival [59]. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that
ONC mediates some of its effects by reducing cellular
levels of NF-κB. In Jurkat cells, ONC induces an arrest
of proliferation, accompanied by an altered subcellular
distribution and reduced expression of NF-κB [17]. In
addition, in hMM cells ONC inhibits NF-κB nuclear
translocation induced by TNF-α [60] and produces a
down-regulation of the NFKB1 gene, which encodes
the NF-κB subunit p50, mediated by the increase in hsamiR-17* and the decrease in hsa-miR-30c levels [61]. It
can be expected that, in these cell lines, the inactivation of
NF-κB would also lead to the up-regulation of GADD45A.
TXNIP, a protein with multiple functions, plays
an important role in redox homeostasis [62]. Extensive
evidence shows that TXNIP acts as a tumor suppressor
[63–69]. ONC induces the expression of two ATF3controlled genes whose encoded proteins promote cell
cycle arrest at different checkpoints (G2/M in the case of
GADD45A and G0/G1 in the case of TXNIP [64, 70]).
This effect would be in accordance with previous results
showing that ONC arrests cell growth of Jurkat and NCI/
ADR-RES cells without altering the percentage of cells in
the different cell cycle phases [17, 31].
ONC-regulated genes significantly affect the
MAPK signaling pathway (Table 3). In this regard, it is
noteworthy that TXNIP, through ASK1 activation [71],

and GADD45A, through its interaction with mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinase 4 (MEKK4), are
involved in the apoptosis induced by the p38 MAPK/JNK
signaling pathway [72]. At the same time, the activation
of p38 MAPK/JNK induces the expression of EGR1
[73, 74] and ATF3 [75], reinforcing the initial action of
ONC thorough the up-regulation of these two genes
(Figure 3). Accordingly, ONC is a potent activator of the
stress-activated protein kinases JNK1, JNK2 and p38
MAPK in primary and immortalized fibroblasts [18].

In this work we show that, in addition to the MAPK
pathway, ONC affects the Jak-STAT signaling pathway by
altering the expression of different genes. Interestingly, it has
been previously described that the cytotoxic effect of ONC
on hMM cells is also mediated by the Jak-STAT pathway
[12]. Regarding the Jak-STAT signaling, ONC treated NCI/
ADR-RES cells show an increased expression of interleukin
6 (IL6) (Table 1 and Figure 2), previously observed in hMMtreated cells [12]. IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that presents
both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties as well as pro- and

PPP1R15A, and IL6. It indirectly increases the expression of TXNIP and EGR1 and binds to CREB5. ATF3 and GADD45A expression is
increased by EGR1. IL6 affects the expression of ATF3 and indirectly that of EGR1. At the same time, IL6 indirectly affects and is affected
by PPP1R15A and GADD45A, and it is also indirectly affected by TXNIP. Solid line: interaction between two genes or the proteins coded by

anti-tumorigenic abilities, depending on the cell type and
conditions. It is also involved in metabolism control [76]. Its
overexpression in cancer has been linked to cachexia [77], a
drawback in the therapeutic use of ONC. Nevertheless, this
effect may be partly counterbalanced by the ONC-induced
overexpression of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C),
which is found among the 20 most ONC up-regulated
genes (Table 1). MEF2C is a myogenic transcription factor
that plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development
and differentiation, but is down-regulated in cachexia [78].
In addition, ONC overexpression of inteleukin-33 (IL33),
together with amphiregulin (AREG) (Table 1), may offset
the pro-inflammatory properties of IL6 because it has been
recently demonstrated that both participate in a pathway
of innate immune cell-mediated tissue protection in the
intestinal track [79]. Finally, ATF3 has been described as
being able to epigenetically regulate the EGR1 expression,
leading to attenuation of pro-inflammatory chemokines in
human enterocytes [80].

lines [12]. Interestingly, only the expression of 10 genes was
altered by both RNase treatments (see the Results section).
Among those genes, asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and
the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) coding
genes are worth mentioning. Both are down-regulated by
both RNases and are involved in amino acid metabolism,
although we have not found any term related to amino
acid metabolism either in gene ontology analysis or in the
KEGG pathway annotation. PE5 down-regulates more
genes related to amino acid biosynthesis than the two
mentioned above. Its effect is actually to down-regulate this
de novo biosynthesis that is significantly increased in cancer
cells [28]. In addition, the most PE5 up-regulated gene,
Homeobox containing 1 (HMBOX1), is also found among
the 20 most ONC up-regulated genes. However, its function
is not well known and is controversial [81]. Very likely,
these coincidences are only the result of the pleiotropic
effects of both RNases. Moreover, among the affected gene
ontology terms, only five were common between ONC and
PE5, and when compared the KEGG pathway annotation,
no terms showed coincidence ([28] and Table 3).
The mechanism used by PE5 to kill cancer cells
is primarily related to its ability to down-regulate the
expression of genes that code for enzymes involved in the
metabolic pathways deregulated in the cancer cells. This
decrease in the expression levels of metabolic enzymes
is assisted by the down- and up-regulation of several
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively, that
down-regulate the expression of genes coding for these
enzymes [28]. The only link between ONC regulated
genes and cell metabolism is through the glucose uptake
inhibitory effect of TXNIP and ARRDC4 [82, 83].
Taken together, our results indicate that the cytotoxic
mechanisms exerted by ONC and PE5 on tumor cells are
different, which is consistent with their different cellular
localization and perhaps with their different RNA targets,
cytosolic RNAs, and nuclear RNAs, respectively. Thus,
it is tempting to anticipate a synergistic effect between
RNases that exert their action in the cell cytosol and those
that do it in the cell nucleus.

The mechanism described for ONC cytotoxicity
is cell-line independent
Six of the seven ONC differentially expressed genes
found in the OVCAR-8 cell line are also differentially
expressed in the NCI/ADR-RES cell line (see the Results
section). Additionally, in both cell lines, ATF3 and TXNIP
are the most ONC up-regulated genes (see the Results
section). Furthermore, in OVCAR-8 cell line a slight but
significant increase in the expression of the rest of the
networked transcription regulators differentially expressed
in NCI/ADR-RES is observed, with fold change values
between 1.8 and 1.5. These results indicate that the effect
induced by ONC on both cell lines is similar. It is also
noteworthy that ONC treatment of different hMM cell
lines increased the expression of ATF3, GADD45A, and
IL6, and involved the MAPK and Jak-STAT signaling
pathways [12], suggesting that the cytotoxic mechanism
described here for ONC is not cell-type specific.

ONC causes different pleiotropic effects than
those observed for PE5

ONC as antiviral agent beyond its nucleic acids
degradation ability

ONC and PE5, as RNA-damaging drugs, have
pleiotropic effects. Focusing on the NCI/ADR-RES results,
the pleiotropic effects caused by these RNases are clearly
different. ONC affects a lower number of genes (11.5fold less) than PE5 [28]. Among them, the percentage of
up- and down-regulated genes differs between the two
RNase treatments. Of the ONC differentially expressed
genes, 89% are up-regulated and only 11% are downregulated, while about half of the PE5 differentially
expressed genes are up-regulated and half are downregulated [28]. This suggests that the ONC initial action
is the activation of gene expression, in agreement with
the results previously obtained for ONC-treated hMM cell

ONC has been described as having antiviral activity
[25]. Due to the ability of wild type ONC and several
ONC variants to cleave different types of RNA [10–15],
as well as dsRNA [24], their antiviral properties have
been mainly linked to degradation of viral genomes and/
or host-cell nucleic acids needed for viral replication
[25, 84]. However, the finding that ONC cell treatment
promotes the up-regulation of ATF3 transcription factor
independently of the cell type, leads to the proposal that
other mechanisms can strengthen ONC antiviral action.
ATF3 is a transcription factor whose role in cancer is
clearly cellular-context dependent, but it seems essential
for the maintenance of host defense mechanisms [34].

Genomic integration of HPV DNA, occurring in
more than 90% of cervical cancers, results in viral E6
protein expression that can interact with a cellular ubiquitin
ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) and target the tumor
suppressor p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [85].
ATF3 interaction with viral protein E6 prevents p53 from
ubiquitination and degradation, leading to expression of
p53-target genes, cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic cell death.
Thus, ATF3 is a repressor of the oncogenic viral protein E6
and blocks HPV-induced carcinogenesis [86]. Moreover,
the ONC overexpressed gene that codes for protein tyrosine
phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) has been linked to the
inhibition of MAPK signaling through dephosphorylation
of p44/42 MAPK, which inhibits AP-1 and the subsequent
expression of the E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins responsible
for cervical cancer initiation and progression [87].
After infection at a portal entry, herpes simplex
viruses (HSV) infect sensory nerve endings and are
retrograde transported to the neuronal nucleus, where
they establish a silent or latent state. It is not well known
how these virulent viruses remain silent. However, it has
recently been described that ATF3 plays a key role in the
maintenance of the HSV in this latent state by increasing
the expression of a non-coding RNA known as the latencyassociated transcript (LAT) [88].
Finally, ONC also inhibits 90-99.9% of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in H9
leukemia cells over a four-day incubation at concentrations
not toxic to uninfected H9 cells [25]. HIV-1 transactivator
protein Tat uses CREB to promote IL10 production.
Although the importance of this for HIV pathogenesis is
not clear, IL10 can inhibit HIV-1 replication in monocytes
and macrophages, suggesting that Tat/CREB-induced IL10
production provides a negative feedback signal to prevent
excess HIV-1 replication [89].

ONC was produced and purified from Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pONC essentially
as described in [91]. The molecular mass of ONC was
confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry at the
Unitat cientificotècnica de suport, Institut de Recerca,
Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain).
ONC concentration was determined by ultraviolet
spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of
10470 M-1 cm-1, calculated as reported [92].

Cell lines and culture conditions
NCI/ADR-RES human ovarian cancer MDR cell
line (formerly MCF-7/ADR) [93] was a generous gift from
Dr. Ramon Colomer of the Institut Català d’Oncologia
de Girona, Hospital Universitari de Girona Dr. Josep
Trueta (Girona, Spain). It was initially obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,
Virginia) and was used immediately after thawing. The
OVCAR-8 human ovarian cancer cell line was obtained
from the National Cancer Institute’s DCTD tumor
repository (Frederick, USA) and was used immediately
after thawing. NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cells were
routinely grown at 37ºC in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 in DMEM (Gibco, Germany) containing
1.84  µM doxorubicin (Tedec-Meiji Farma, Spain) and
RPMI (Gibco, Germany), respectively, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Germany), 50 U/ml
penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Germany).
Cells remained free of Mycoplasma and were propagated
according to established protocols.

Cell proliferation assay
NCI/ADR-RES cells (104 per well) and OVCAR-8
cells (1.5 x 103 per well) were seeded into 96-well
plates. After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated for
24, 36, or 48 h with various concentrations of ONC,
ranging from 0.001 to 10 μM. Sensitivity to RNase
was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma,
USA). Data were collected by measuring the absorbance
at 570 nm with a Synergy 4 multi-well plate reader
(Biotek Instruments, USA). The IC5, IC10, and IC15 values
represent the concentrations of ONC required to inhibit
cell proliferation by 5, 10, and 15%, respectively, and
were calculated by interpolation of the obtained growth
curves. Data were calculated as the mean ± SD of three
independent experiments conducted in triplicates.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results explain the cytotoxic mechanism induced
by ONC in treated cancer cells through a network of
different ONC up-regulated genes. Among them, ATF3 upregulation plays a central role in the key events triggered
by ONC that finally lead to apoptosis. This mechanism
is cell-type independent. Up-regulation of ATF3 may
also explain the antiviral properties of this RNase. ONCaffected genes are different from those affected by nucleardirected RNases. The pleiotropic effects of both types of
RNases make them attractive as therapeutics to treat either
cancer or virus-promoted diseases.

in cell proliferation (0.5 μM ONC for NCI/ADR-RES cells
and 0.06 μM ONC for OVCAR-8 cells). Cells were then
harvested at 400xg for 5 min at 4°C and washed twice with
cold PBS. Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana
miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored
at -80°C. Four independent preparations were performed
for each cell line. The 260/280 nm absorbance ratio of
each sample was checked using a NanoDrop ND-1000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). RIN
values were used to check RNA integrity using an Agilent

normalization, the RankProd method [98] was applied
to identify differentially expressed genes. Genes were
considered differentially expressed when they had a false
discovery rate adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change
≥ 2 or ≤ -2. Data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus repository [99] (http://www.ncbi.nih.
gov/geo) and are available under the accession number:
GSE75494.

Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway
annotation
In the NCI/ADR-RES cell line, differentially
expressed genes were characterized functionally with a
hypergeometric test to find over-represented gene ontology
terms in the three main broad ontologies (biological
process, molecular function, and cellular component)
(www.geneontology.org), and were also mapped to the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
(www.kegg.jp), which assigns proteins to pathways,
to find over-represented pathways. The analyses were
done using the GOstats and RamiGO software packages
from Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org). A p-value
cutoff of 0.05 was used. The network representation of
linkages between ONC-differentially expressed genes
was constructed and drawn using the Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) package available on-line at http://www.
ingenuity.com/products/ipa.

were performed at Bioarray, S.L. (Alacant, Spain)
using the SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression
Microarray (Agilent Technologies, USA), a highdensity oligonucleotide microarray that contains 60,000
probes, corresponding to 27,958 Entrez Gene RNAs
and 7,419 lncRNAs. Sample preparation and microarray
processing procedures were done according to the TwoColor Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis v.
6.5 (Agilent Technologies, USA). Briefly, 200 ng of total
RNA were used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA
with AffinityScript-Reverse Transcriptase and Oligo dTPromoter Primer. cDNA was simultaneously amplified
and transcribed into cyanine 3- or cyanine 5-labeled
cRNA employing T7 RNA polymerase in the presence
of cyanine 3-CTP or cyanine 5-CTP. The labeled cRNA
(antisense) was purified, evaluated using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
and hybridized to the oligonucleotide microarrays at 65°C
for 17 h. Microarrays were then washed and scanned on
a G2565CA microarray scanner upgraded to a resolution
of 2 micron (Agilent Technologies, USA). Data were
extracted from the resulting TIFF-images using the Feature
Extraction software v. 10.7 (Agilent Technologies, USA).
Raw microarray data were statistically analyzed using the
Marray, pcaMethods, Limma, and RankProd software
packages from Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.
org), which uses the R statistical environment and
programming language. In particular, the non-specific
signal was removed from the total intensity using the
normexp background correction method with an offset of
20 [95]. Then intra-slide normalization was done using
the Loess method [96] to make intensities consistent
within each array, and inter-slide normalization was
performed employing the quantiles method [97] to achieve
consistency between arrays. After each of these analyses,
a quality control analysis of microarray data (RG density

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RTqPCR)
mRNA expression of three ONC up-regulated
genes (TXNIP, ATF3, and GADD45A) and two downregulated genes (PHGDH and ASNS) were examined
by RT-qPCR. The same RNA samples used for
microarrays analysis were used in this analysis. First,
RNA samples were digested with DNase to prevent
genomic contamination using the RNase-Free DNase
Set (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. They were evaluated using an Agilent
2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA) and
a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, for each sample, 0.5 μg
of RNA was used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA
with the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific forward and
reverse primers for the selected genes were designed
with Primer3 (http://primer3.ut.ee) and checked with
NetPrimer (http://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/).
Primer sequences for ONC-regulated genes were:
TXNIP (F: GCTTGCGGAGTGGCTAAAGT; R:

GAAAGGA; R: CAGGCACAACACCACGTTATC),
PHGDH (F: TATTGTTCGCTCTGCCACCA; R:
TCATAACCAAGATGCCCTTCC) and ASNS (F:
AAAGCCGAGGAGGAGAGTGA, R: GGTGGCAGAG
ACAAGTAATAGGA). To select a constitutive gene
as a reference for normalizing data, the transcription
abundances of five genes (ACTB, GUSB, TBP, HPRT1,
and ALAS1) were measured for all cDNA samples.
Primer sequences are described in reference [28].
Among them, TBP showed the highest stability (lower
standard deviation of the Ct; results not shown) and it
was therefore selected for data normalization. Real-time
PCRs were performed in an optical 96-well plate with an
ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detector System (Applied
Biosystems, USA), using SYBR Green to monitor
dscDNA synthesis. Reactions contained 1x Power
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
USA), 300 nM of gene-specific forward primer, 300
nM of gene-specific reverse primer, and 5 μl of a 50fold dilution of the previously synthesized cDNA in a
final volume of 20 μl. The following standard thermal
profile was used for all real-time PCRs: 95°C for 10
min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min.
A dissociation step was performed after amplification to
confirm the presence of a single amplicon. To estimate
variation in the technique, three technical replicates were
carried out for each cDNA sample. Data were analyzed
with the 7300 SDS 1.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems,
USA). To generate a baseline-subtracted plot of the
logarithmic increase in fluorescence signal (ΔRn) versus
cycle number, baseline data were collected between
cycles 3 and 15. All amplification plots were analyzed
with an Rn threshold of 0.2 to obtain threshold cycle
(Ct) values. The amplification efficiency for each gene
was calculated based on five dilutions of cDNA ranging
from 1 to 3.2x10-4 and the equation E = 10(−1/slope). All
genes had an efficiency value between 1.85 and 2.05.
The relative transcription abundances (RTA) of ONCtarget genes (TXNIP, ATF3, GADD45A, PHGDH, and
ASNS) were calculated as RTA = EΔCt(control-sample)(Target) /
EΔCt(control-sample)(Reference) [100], where control refers to a mix
of equal amounts of untreated samples. Fold changes
were calculated as the ratio between RTA values obtained
for ONC-treated cells and those obtained for untreated
cells. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was
checked using non-retrotranscriptase controls and the
absence of environmental contamination using nontemplate controls.
