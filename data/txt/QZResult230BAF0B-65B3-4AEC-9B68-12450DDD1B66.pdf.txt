BACKGROUND: To the authors’ knowledge, the benefit of primary tumor resection among patients with metastatic inflammatory
breast cancer (IBC) is unknown. METHODS: The authors reviewed 172 cases of metastatic IBC. All patients received chemotherapy
with or without radiotherapy and/or surgery. Patients were classified as responders or nonresponders to chemotherapy. The 5-year
overall survival (OS) and distant progression-free survival (DPFS) and local control at the time of last follow-up were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 79 patients (46%) underwent surgery. OS and DPFS were better among patients treated with surgery versus no
surgery (47% vs 10%, respectively [P <.0001] and 30% vs 3%, respectively [P <.0001]). Surgery plus radiotherapy was associated with
better survival compared with treatment with surgery or radiotherapy alone (OS rate: 50% vs 25% vs 14%, respectively; DPFS rate:
32% vs 18% vs 15%, respectively [P <.0001 for both]). Surgery was associated with better survival for both responders (OS rate for
surgery vs no surgery: 49% vs 23% [P < .0001] and DPFS rate for surgery vs no surgery: 31% vs 8% [P <.0001]) and nonresponders
(OS rate for surgery vs no surgery: 40% vs 6% [P <.0001] and DPFS rate for surgery vs no surgery: 30% vs 0% [P <.0001]). On multivariate analysis, treatment with surgery plus radiotherapy and response to chemotherapy were found to be significant predictors of
better OS and DPFS. Local control at the time of last follow-up was 4-fold more likely in patients who underwent surgery with or
without radiotherapy compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone (81% vs 18%; P <.0001). Surgery and response to
chemotherapy independently predicted local control on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that for select patients with metastatic IBC, multimodality treatment including primary tumor resection may result in better

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of the disease that accounts for 1% to 2% of all breast cancers but
as much as 10% of breast cancer deaths. As many as 30% of patients with IBC present with metastatic disease.1
Multimodality therapy that includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and modified radical mastectomy results in optimal survival and local control outcomes for patients with nonmetastatic IBC,2 with single-institution series demonstrating
5-year OS rates of 45% to 57% and locoregional control rates of > 80%.3-6
However, the reported outcomes for patients with metastatic IBC are dismal. With chemotherapy alone, 5-year OS
rates of < 10% have been reported.7-9 A contemporary review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database reported a 2-year OS rate of 39% for those with metastatic disease.10 Although this is an improvement over historical data, it is not clear what percentage of patients received radiotherapy and/or surgery, and therefore the benefits attributable to locoregional treatment in patients with metastatic IBC remain largely unknown.

Original Article

Primary tumor resection in the setting of metastatic
breast cancer remains controversial because to our knowledge it has never been definitively associated with
improved outcomes. It is traditionally reserved for select
patients and for those in need of palliation. The issue
remains a matter of debate because recent literature has
suggested that surgery may actually result in better survival and local control outcomes in patients with stage IV
disease.11-19 Using the National Cancer Database, Khan
et al analyzed > 16,000 cases of metastatic breast cancer
and identified a nearly 2-fold increase in the 3-year OS
rate for patients undergoing mastectomy with negative
surgical margins compared with those who did not
undergo surgery (35.7% vs 17.3%; P 5 .01).11 In a recent
review of the SEER database that included > 700 patients
with stage IV IBC, primary tumor resection was associated with a 51% decreased risk of death compared with
patients who did not undergo surgery.10 Furthermore, as
patients with metastatic disease experience longer survival,
durable chest wall control becomes a significant issue in
managing their disease. This issue is particularly relevant
in patients with IBC, in whom local disease recurrence after a response to therapy may be more likely than in
patients with noninflammatory breast cancer.20
In the current study, we evaluated our experience
with surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients
with metastatic IBC. To the best of our knowledge, the
current study is the largest single-institution series of
patients with stage IV IBC reported in the literature to
date. Our objectives were to determine local control and
survival rates for those who did and did not undergo surgery and to identify additional prognostic and treatmentrelated variables associated with improved outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the records of all patients treated for de novo
stage IV IBC at the study institution from 1994 through
2009. Patients with metastases identified within 3 months
of their diagnosis of IBC were included. A multidisciplinary team confirmed each IBC diagnosis based on the
clinical picture of rapid-onset (<3months) breast enlargement and diffuse erythema. Patients with secondary skin
changes from locally advanced disease were not included.
The initial staging workup included bilateral mammogram and ultrasound of the breasts and lymph node
basins, bone scan, chest x-ray, and abdominal CT scan.
Patients were staged according to 2002 American Joint
Committee on Cancer staging guidelines. Review of the
data for this investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the study institution.
1320

The data set was comprised of 172 patients. Demographic, tumor-related, and treatment-related variables
including race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status score at the time of diagnosis, menopausal status, hormone and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor status, tumor
grade, histologic type, lymphovascular space invasion
(LVSI), pathologic response of the primary tumor to systemic therapy, clinical response to systemic therapy at sites
of distant disease, number of distant disease sites, surgical
intent, surgical margin status, and locoregional treatment
were evaluated.
All patients were treated with primary,
anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and the majority also
received a taxane. Patients with refractory disease were
treated with additional/alternative therapy at the discretion of their medical oncologists. Endocrine therapy was
given to patients with hormone receptor-positive disease
as reported below. Trastuzumab was given to all patients
with HER2-positive disease who were treated after
2001. Additional adjuvant systemic therapy was given to
surgical patients at the discretion of the treating medical
oncologist. Clinical response to systemic therapy was
assessed at distant disease sites using physical examination and radiographic findings, which were classified
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.21 Patients were classified
either as responders who achieved a complete or partial
response to systemic therapy or as nonresponders who
demonstrated stable or progressive disease. For patients
in the no-surgery group, response to chemotherapy was
assessed at the time of maximum clinical response and
for patients in the surgery group, response was assessed
at the time of surgery.
Surgical margins measuring  2mm were considered to be negative and those measuring < 2 mm were
considered to be close. Skin margins were not routinely
assessed. A pathologic complete response (pCR) was
defined as no residual invasive disease in the primary tumor bed and resected lymph nodes. The surgical intent
was curative if there was no clinical evidence of active distant disease at the time of surgery or if all distant disease
was eradicated by concurrent metastasectomy. For
patients with active distant disease at the time of surgery,
the intent was considered to be for local control.
The target volume for radiotherapy was the chest
wall and draining lymphatics. The most common regimen delivered 51 gray (Gy) in a twice-daily fraction of 1.5
Gy. Patients in the surgery group also received a 15-Gy
chest wall boost.

Statistical Analysis

Endpoints were death, distant disease progression, and
local control at the time of last follow-up. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death and
DPFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the
date of distant disease progression or death. Local control
was defined as no clinically appreciable chest wall disease.
The presence of a mass, erythema, or skin thickening was
considered minimal chest wall disease. Dermal nodules,
rash, superficial tumor implants, or pain in the setting of
any local skin involvement were classified as moderate.
Severe chest wall involvement included fungating lesions,
ulceration, or drainage. OS and DPFS were calculated
using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The log-rank test was used
to compare differences in survival between the groups.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) and to correlate outcomes with risk
variables. Subgroups were compared using the chi-square
test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test when appropriate.
Severity of local skin involvement was compared using the
Fisher exact test. All P values were 2-sided, and a P value  .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 79 patients (46%) underwent primary tumor
resection. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. In
94 patients (55%), metastatic disease was limited to 1 site.
This was bone in 34 patients, 24 of whom (71%) were in
the surgery group, and the ipsilateral supraclavicular
lymph nodes in 6 patients, 5 of whom (83%) were in the
surgery group. The median time to surgery was 7.5
months from the date of diagnosis; 19% of patients
underwent surgery within 6 months of diagnosis, 61%
between 6 months and 1 year, and 20% underwent surgery > 1 year after diagnosis. The surgical procedures performed were modified radical mastectomy (74 patients;
93%), segmental mastectomy with axillary lymph node
dissection (2 patients; 3%), and total mastectomy (3
patients; 4%).
Endocrine therapy was given to 39% of patients (18
of 46 patients) with hormone receptor-positive disease in
the no-surgery group and 74% of patients (32 of 43
patients) with hormone receptor-positive disease in the
surgery group. Of the 45 patients with HER2-positive
tumors, 73% (33 patients) received trastuzumab. Of the
27 patients in the surgery group with HER2-positive
tumors, 21 received neoadjuvant trastuzumab; the
remaining 6 patients received trastuzumab either in the
adjuvant setting (4 patients) or not at all (2 patients). A
pCR was noted in 15% of patients in the surgery group

(12 patients); 7 of these patients (58%) had HER2positive disease and 5 of these 7 had received neoadjuvant
trastuzumab.
The median follow-up was 33 months (range, 3-166
months). The 5-year OS and DPFS rates for the entire
cohort were 29% and 17%, respectively. Notably, 8
patients (5%) survived for > 10 years. Several factors,
including an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1,
HER2 positivity, absence of LVSI, response to chemotherapy, pCR, and locoregional treatment with surgery
and/or radiotherapy, were found to be significant predictors of improved OS and DPFS on univariate analysis
(Table 2). Black race and > 1 site of distant disease were
found to be predictors of worse DPFS but did not significantly affect OS.
The 5-year OS and DPFS rates were 47% versus
10% (P < .0001) and 30% versus 3% (P < .0001),
respectively, for the surgery and no-surgery groups, as
shown in Figures 1a and 1b.
Ten patients in the surgery group underwent metastasectomy procedures in addition to receiving trimodal
therapy to the primary tumor site. These procedures
included liver resection (5 patients), contralateral axillary
lymph node dissection (7 patients), craniotomy (1
patient), excision of distant dermal metastases (1 patient),
supraclavicular lymph node dissection (1 patient), and 2
staged neuroradiosurgery procedures in 1 patient. This
group ranged in age from 40 years to 62 years and all had
an ECOG performance status score of 1. They were further selected based on response to systemic therapy (having either a complete or partial clinical response), distant
disease burden (1-2 sites), and the feasibility of achieving
stage IV no evidence of disease status with metastasectomy. The OS for this group ranged from 10 months to
166 months and 7 of these patients were alive at the time
of last follow-up with stable disease or with no evidence of
disease. OS and DPFS analyses were repeated after excluding this subset of patients from the surgery group and
revealed 5-year OS rates of 40% versus 10% (P < .0001)
and DPFS rates of 29% versus 3% (P < .0001), respectively, for the surgery and no-surgery groups. These
patients were included in the surgery group for the remainder of the analyses.
When survival was analyzed by locoregional treatment strategy, patients receiving both surgery and radiotherapy had significantly improved survival outcomes
compared with patients who received either chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery alone (Figs. 1c and 1d).
Responders demonstrated significantly higher OS
and DPFS compared with nonresponders. The 5-year OS

All factors associated with improved survival on univariate analysis were incorporated into a multivariate regression model. Response to chemotherapy (HR, 0.49; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.3-0.8 [P 5 .005]) and
locoregional treatment with surgery plus radiotherapy (HR,
0.9; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6 [P 5 .0001]) reached statistical significance for an effect on OS. Three variables were found to
be significantly associated with an independent effect on
DPFS: response to chemotherapy (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40.9 [P 5 .02]), locoregional treatment with surgery plus
radiotherapy (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7 [P 5 .001]), and

unknown in 2 patients. Fifteen patients (19%) in the surgery group developed local disease recurrences and reoperation for local control was performed in 4 of them. There
was a marked difference in local control based on locoregional treatment strategy (Fig. 3 Top). Treatment with
surgery alone or surgery plus radiotherapy was associated
with a 4-fold greater rate of local control compared with
patients who received systemic therapy alone (P < .0001)
and a > 2-fold increase over patients treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. Surgery was also associated
with better local control irrespective of the patient’s

a
pCR was associated with local control in 100% of cases and therefore an
OR could not be generated.

(HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92 [P 5 .03]) were found to
be significantly associated with local control. Based on
results from the univariate analysis, it is clear that pCR is
strongly associated with local control, but it could not be
included in the multivariate model due to statistical limitations associated with a zero event rate for chest wall disease among patients with a pCR.
DISCUSSION
Primary tumor resection in the management of metastatic
noninflammatory breast cancer is controversial; its benefit
in the treatment of metastatic IBC is even less clear. However, treatment issues specific to inflammatory carcinoma,
such as its propensity for severe and sometimes painful
local disease, resistance to standard chemotherapy, and its
high recurrence rate after treatment20 make the issue of
primary tumor resection particularly relevant and led us
to review our own experience.
In the current analysis, we demonstrated a 5-year
OS rate of 29% and a 5-year DPFS rate of 17% for
patients diagnosed with metastatic IBC. This is significantly higher than the 5-year OS rate of 10% reported
elsewhere in the literature and the 6-month median survival previously published from our institution.7,8,22
These higher survival rates can be attributed to recent
advances in breast cancer therapy, including more effective chemotherapeutic regimens, the increased use of endocrine therapy, targeted therapies such as trastuzumab
and lapatinib, and the use of aggressive and individualized
1326

radiotherapy regimens. It is also likely that more patients
in this recent cohort received multimodality treatment, a
factor that has been clearly associated with better survival
among patients with IBC.3,10 In the current series, 56%
of patients received some form of locoregional therapy
and 40% received surgery as well as radiotherapy. The primary focus of this analysis was to determine what benefit,
if any, can be attributed to aggressive locoregional therapy
and surgery in particular.
First, using a direct comparison of surgery versus no
surgery, we demonstrated that primary tumor resection is
associated with a nearly 5-fold increase in OS and a 10fold increase in DPFS in patients with metastatic IBC.
Importantly, the surgery group was more than twice as
likely to have had a measurable response to systemic therapy. This factor has been associated with improved survival in patients with stage IV disease and it is likely that it
represents a confounding variable in the current study as
well as a basis for selection bias.3,14,23,24 Other factors that
have been associated with improved survival in patients
with advanced breast cancer include having a more favorable ECOG performance status score and a lower burden
of distant disease. Although both of these factors were
more common in the surgery group, they did not appear
to significantly impact survival on multivariate analysis.
The same is also likely true for HER2-positive receptor
status. Although the surgery group had proportionately
more patients with HER2-positive disease, a factor that
was also associated with improved outcomes in the current
study population, survival analysis among the subset of
HER2-positive patients showed that OS was still significantly higher in the surgery group compared with the nosurgery group (5-year OS rate of 62% vs 13%, respectively; P < .0001 [data not shown]).
There were 10 highly select patients in the surgery
group who underwent one or more metastasectomy procedures in addition to receiving trimodal therapy for their
primary tumor sites. This subset of patients was included
in the analysis based on our objective of reporting outcomes for a contemporary cohort of patients with stage IV
IBC. Although this group of 10 patients did contribute to
the more favorable outcomes noted in the surgery group
as a whole, both OS and DPFS remained significantly
higher for the surgery group after excluding them from a
repeat survival analysis (as reported earlier in the text).
Consistent with IBC studies performed in the nonmetastatic setting, the highest survival rates in the current
series were observed among patients who were treated
with trimodality therapy.3-6 Although the addition of either locoregional treatment modality improved survival

over chemotherapy alone, only treatment with surgery
plus radiotherapy was found to be associated with a significant increase in survival on multivariate analysis. In fact,
trimodality therapy resulted in a > 5-fold increase in OS
compared with patients treated with systemic therapy
alone. Within our selected surgery cohort, it is important
to note that surgery plus radiotherapy was associated with
improved outcomes over surgery alone, suggesting that
further improvement in outcomes could, at least in part,
be based on additional treatment and independent of
aforementioned selection biases.
Not surprisingly, clinical response to systemic treatment was found to be a significant and independent prognosticator for both survival and local control. Patients with
a response to systemic therapy had a 3-fold increase in OS
and DPFS over nonresponders. In an effort to better
define any survival benefit attributable to surgery, we compared outcomes between the surgery and no-surgery
groups after stratifying by response to systemic therapy. In
a similar analysis of patients with nonmetastatic IBC,
Fleming et al demonstrated no difference in survival
among patients who failed to respond to chemotherapy
but, among 103 patients with a CR or PR, the 5-year disease-specific survival rate increased from 43% to 62% with
the addition of mastectomy.23 In the current series, surgery
was associated with improved OS and DPFS both for responders as well as nonresponders. It is possible that responders in the current study cohort who did not undergo
surgery were selected out because of a poor response at the
primary tumor site, a variable that was not included in the
current analysis but one that warrants further investigation.
In fact, some contemporary studies have suggested that
surgery may be reserved for those patients with residual
disease after a PR to chemotherapy or those with local
recurrences after a CR to chemotherapy and radiotherapy
without significantly compromising survival.25,26
Another area for further research centers around surgical margin status and its impact on outcomes. Close or
positive surgical margins have frequently been associated
with higher local failure rates in patients with nonmetastatic IBC.3,9,12 Given that surgical margin status did not
appear to affect survival or local control in the current series, we postulate that the addition of individualized, typically comprehensive high-dose radiotherapy in 68% of
the surgical patients in the current study likely negated
any impact on outcomes from a positive or close surgical
margin. However, it is also possible that the small number
of patients with positive surgical margins was insufficiently powered to demonstrate an effect that really does
exist.

As patients with metastatic IBC experience longer
survival, the issue of maintaining chest wall control
becomes more relevant. The results of the current study
demonstrated rates of chest wall control after surgery
alone or surgery plus radiotherapy that far exceed those
noted after radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Thus,
surgical consultation for local control, especially for those
patients with responsive distant disease, is reasonable to
consider. Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis of nonresponders, chest wall involvement was nearly 3-fold more
likely among patients who did not undergo surgery.
Future investigations into quality-of-life improvements
associated with chest wall disease control may help to
guide surgical decision-making in this subgroup of
patients who do not have responsive distant disease and
therefore may have significantly shorter survival.
These retrospective data suggest that surgery may
impact outcomes for patients with metastatic IBC. However, factors such as favorable tumor biology, response to
systemic therapy, and lower distant disease burden have
undoubtedly biased these results. Clinical recommendations for surgery should be highly selective and include a
thorough discussion of the limitations of supporting studies such as the current report as well as an acknowledgment of the lack of data from a randomized trial.
