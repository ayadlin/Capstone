Recently, fusion of ERG to the androgen-regulated, prostatespecific TMPRSS2 gene has been identified as the most
frequent genetic alteration in prostate cancer. At low
frequency, TMPRSS2-ETV1 and TMPRSS2-ETV4 fusion genes
have been described. In this study, we report two novel ETV4
fusion genes in prostate cancer: KLK2-ETV4 and CANT1-ETV4.
Both gene fusions have important unique aspects. KLK2 is a
well-established androgen-induced and prostate-specific gene.
Fusion of KLK2 to ETV4 results in the generation of an
additional ETV4 exon, denoted exon 4a. This novel exon
delivers an ATG for the longest open reading frame, in this
way avoiding translation start in KLK2 exon 1. Although wildtype CANT1 has two alternative first exons (exons 1 and 1a),
only exon 1a was detected in CANT1-ETV4 fusion transcripts.
We show that CANT1 transcripts starting at exon 1a have an
androgen-induced and prostate-specific expression pattern,
whereas CANT1 transcripts starting at exon 1 are not prostate
specific. So, the two novel ETV4 fusion partners possess as
predominant common characteristics androgen-induction
and prostate-specific expression. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3094–8]

loss of the region between TMPRSS2 and ERG, in others, this region
has been retained, indicative of different mechanisms of gene
fusion (10). At low frequency, fusion of TMPRSS2 to a second ETS
gene, ETV1, which maps to chromosome band 7p21, has been
reported (7, 10). TMPRSS2 seems the only fusion partner of ERG,
but it has recently been shown that ETV1 has more fusion
partners (11).4
For a third ETS gene, ETV4, only fusion to TMPRSS2 has been
described (12). In the present study, we identified in clinical
prostate cancer samples two unique novel ETV4 fusion partners:
Kallikrein 2 (KLK2) and Calcium-Activated Nucleotidase 1 (CANT1).
KLK2, or hGK1, is a well-known prostate marker highly
homologous to KLK3 or prostate-specific antigen (13). Like KLK3,
KLK2 is prostate-specific and androgen-regulated expressed
(13, 14). We show that CANT1 expression is also androgen
regulated. CANT1 possesses two alternative first exons, but only
one of these is present in the CANT1-ETV4 fusion transcript. In
contrast to the majority of CANT1 transcripts, this mRNA is
preferentially expressed in the prostate. The novel fusion genes
indicate prostate-specificity and androgen-regulation as important
characteristics of ETV4 fusion partners in prostate cancer.

Abstract

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in
Western countries (1). Growth of prostate tumors depends on
androgen signaling, mediated by the androgen receptor (AR).
Metastatic disease is treated by endocrine therapy; however, all
tumors eventually become resistant to this therapy. The majority of
resistant tumors still contain a functional active AR (2). In part of
these tumors, AR is overexpressed due to amplification of a small
region of the X chromosome, where AR maps (3).
Most frequent genomic alterations in primary prostate cancers
are losses of large fragments of chromosome arms 6q, 8p, 13q, and
16q and gain of 8q (4, 5). In a subset of tumors, a small region of loss
of chromosome 21q22 has been detected. This genomic alteration is
associated with recurrent fusion of prostate-specific and androgenregulated TMPRSS2 (6) to the ETS transcription factor gene ERG,
which maps at a distance of 3 Mbp from TMPRSS2 on 21q (7).
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is present in 40% to 70% of clinical
prostate cancers (7, 8).3 The gene fusion is an early event that has
also been detected in a proportion of precursor lesions (9). Although
in many tumors, TMPRSS2-ERG overexpression is accompanied by

Samples. Two series of clinical prostate cancer samples were obtained
from the tissue bank of the Erasmus University Medical Center. Samples
were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. All samples contained at
least 70% tumor cells. Collection of patient samples has been performed
according to national legislation concerning ethical requirements. Use of
these samples has been approved by the Erasmus MC Medical Ethics
Committee according to the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects
Act (MEC-2004-261). Prostate cancer xenografts were propagated by serial
transplantation on male nude mice as described (10, 15).
DNA and RNA isolation. RNA from clinical prostate cancer specimens
was isolated using the RNA-Bee kit (Campro Scientific). DNA was isolated
using the DNeasy DNA extraction kit (Qiagen). Xenograft RNA was isolated
according to the LiCl protocol. RNA from the prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP cultured in the presence of 10-9M R1881, or in the absence of
hormone, was isolated using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen).
mRNA expression analysis. Analysis of mRNA expression was
performed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or by QPCR. Two
micrograms of RNA were reverse transcribed using 400 U M-MLV RT
(Invitrogen) and an oligo-dT12 primer. cDNAs of 16 different tissues were
purchased from Clontech. RT-PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5%
agarose gel. QPCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems), using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems), containing 330 nmol/L forward and reverse primer,

in a total volume of 25 AL. Thermocycling conditions were according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Messenger RNA expression was
determined relative to Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG) by the Standard
curve method (Applied Biosystems). Primers are listed in Supplementary
Table S1.
RNA ligase–mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 5¶ RNA
ligase–mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) was
performed using the GeneRacer kit from Invitrogen according to
instructions of the manufacturer. To obtain the 5¶-sequence, cDNA was
amplified with Qiagen Taq (Qiagen) using the Generacer 5¶-primer and an
ETV4 exon 6 primer. PCR products were separated over a 1.5% agarose gel,
bands were excised, purified, and sequenced on an ABI 3100 genetic
analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Array comparative genomic hybridization. Arrays were produced
from the human 3600 BAC/PAC genomic clone set of the Welcome Trust
Sanger Institute, covering the full genome at f1-Mb spacing. DNA labeling
and hybridization were performed as previously described (10). After
hybridization, arrays were scanned in a ScanArray Express HT (PerkinElmer). The resulting images were analyzed with GenePix Pro 5.0 software
(Axon Instruments) and subsequently visualized with an excel macro.
Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization. Interphase fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) was done on 5-Am frozen tissue sections
as described previously (10). BAC clones RP11-100E5 and RP11-209M4
(both flanking ETV4) were purchased from BacPac Resources. Specificity of
BACs was confirmed on metaphase chromosome spreads. BAC DNAs were
either Spectrum Orange– or Spectrum Green–labeled using a Nick
Translation Reagent kit (Vysis). Tissue sections were counterstained with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in antifade solution (Vector Laboratories).
Images of the three fluorochromes were collected on an epifluorescence
microscope (Leica DM) equipped with appropriate filter sets (Leica) and a
CCD cooled camera (Photometrics).
Breakpoint mapping. Fusion points were mapped by standard longrange PCR on 200 ng genomic DNA in the presence of 0.5 Amol/L of each
forward ( fusion partner) and reverse (ETV4) primer with Taq polymerase
and Proofstart DNA polymerase (Qiagen). Primers are given in Supplementary Table S1. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Specific
amplified fragments were isolated and sequenced.

Results and Discussion
ETV4 expression was studied by QPCR on two sets of clinical
prostate cancer samples. Set 1 was composed of 84 clinical prostate
cancer samples (49 primary prostate tumors, 11 lymph node
metastases, and 24 recurrent tumors) and set 2 of 36 primary
prostate tumors and 29 recurrent tumors. In primary tumor (98),
and in recurrent tumor (206), both from set 1, ETV4 overexpression
was detected (Fig. 1A). In the second set, we did not detect ETV4
overexpression (data not shown), indicating that overexpression is
a rare event, occurring in <2% clinical prostate cancers. Follow-up
experiments showed that ETV4 overexpression was caused by
fusions to two different genes with unique properties.
First, RT-PCR experiments with TMPRSS2- and ETV4-specific
primers excluded TMPRSS2 as fusion partner (data not shown).
Next, we performed RLM-RACE using a reverse primer in ETV4
exon 6. Sequencing of the amplified fragments showed KLK2
(sample 98) and CANT1 (sample 206) as novel ETV4 fusion
partners. The presence of KLK2-ETV4 and CANT1-ETV4 fusion
transcripts in the individual samples was confirmed by RT-PCR
(Fig. 1B).
The KLK2-ETV4 mRNA fragment, detected by RLM-RACE,
was composed of KLK2 exon 1 linked to a new ETV4 exon
(here denoted exon 4a), followed by ETV4 exon 5 and 6 sequences
(Fig. 1C). The novel ETV4 exon 4a has a length of 133 bp and
delivers the ATG start codon of the longest predicted open reading
frame in the KLK2-ETV4 fusion transcript (Fig. 1D). KLK2 maps to
chromosome band 19q13 and ETV4 on chromosome band 17q21.
Because of the orientations of KLK2 and ETV4, KLK2-ETV4 gene
fusion cannot be explained by a single chromosomal translocation.
The CANT1-ETV4 fragment detected by RLM-RACE contained
one of the two described exons 1 of CANT1 (here denoted exon 1a).
This exon maps f4 Kbp downstream of the other first exon (here
denoted exon 1; Fig. 1C). CANT1 exon 1a delivers the ATG start

codon of the predicted ETV4 open reading frame. Remarkably,
CANT1-ETV4 fusion transcripts starting at CANT1 exon 1 were not
detected, although wild-type CANT1 transcripts starting either at
exon 1 or 1a of the nonrearranged second allele were present in the
tumor sample and in normal prostate (data not shown). CANT1
and ETV4 map in the same orientation on 17q, at a distance of
f35 Mbp. However, array-based comparative genomic hybridization showed that the genomic region between ETV4 and CANT1
was not lost (data not shown), indicating that either an internal
rearrangement of 17q had occurred or that this region was
reintegrated in another part of the genome.
ETV4 rearrangements in samples 98 and 206 were confirmed
by split signal FISH with probes flanking ETV4 at both sites
(Fig. 2A). Next, the genomic fusion points were mapped by longrange PCR and sequencing (Fig. 2B and C). As expected, the
breakpoints of CANT1-ETV4 were located in CANT1 intron 1,
downstream from exon 1a, and in ETV4 intron 5, respectively.
This latter breakpoint was located in a MER20 repeat, a low copy
repetitive element known to be involved in unstable genomic
regions prone to chromosomal rearrangement (16). Breakpoints
in KLK2 and ETV4 in sample 98 were not in repetitive sequences.
The breakpoint in ETV4 intron 4 of the KLK2-ETV4 rearrangement was 2 bp upstream of ETV4 exon 4a (Figs. 1D and 2C).
Due to the gene fusion the purine-rich ETV4, intron sequence was
replaced by a more pyrimidine-rich sequence of KLK2 intron 1,
generating a novel splice acceptor sequence. To confirm that the
rearrangement induced ETV4 exon 4a, a splicing assay was
performed (Supplementary Fig. S1). ETV4 exon 4a was indeed
retained if the KLK2-ETV4 fusion sequence was used, but not if

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

intron 4 sequence of wild-type ETV4 was used in the assay
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
KLK2 is a well-known androgen-regulated and prostate-specific
gene (13, 14). To establish the specific characteristics of CANT1
expression, QPCR analysis on cDNAs from 11 human prostate
cancer xenografts derived from various stages of the disease and
with different AR status was performed (10, 15). We compared
expression of transcripts starting at CANT1 exon 1 and transcripts
starting at exon 1a to KLK2 expression. KLK2 mRNA expression
was completely restricted to xenografts with highest AR expression
(Fig. 3A). CANT1 transcripts starting at exon 1a showed highest
expression in the more differentiated, androgen-dependent xenografts (Fig. 3B). In contrast, transcripts starting at exon 1 were
expressed at variable levels in all xenografts. Further analysis of
RNA from LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which were in vitro
cultured in the presence of the synthetic androgen R1881 or in the
absence of hormone, showed that both transcripts starting at
CANT1 exon 1 and exon 1a are induced by androgens (Fig. 3C).
As expected, KLK2 expression was strongly induced by androgens.
Next, we tested the tissue specificity of the CANT1 and KLK2
transcripts in a cDNA panel from 16 different normal tissue
samples. KLK2 showed an expected strictly prostate-specific
expression pattern (Fig. 3D). Remarkably, transcripts starting at
CANT1 exon 1 were ubiquitously expressed, but transcripts starting
at exon 1a had a much more restricted expression pattern, with
highest expression in the prostate (Fig. 3E).
Both KLK2-ETV4 and CANT1-ETV4 have specific, unique
characteristics: KLK2-ETV4 because a novel ETV4 exon is
generated (exon 4a) and CANT1-ETV4 because CANT1 exon 1a is

exclusively used in CANT1-ETV4 fusion transcripts. A KLK2-ETV4
fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal KLK2 signal peptide
would be secreted and could not function as a transcription factor.
However, the start codon in the novel ETV4 exon 4a, which is
preceded by an in frame stop codon, prevents the generation of such
a fusion protein. Instead, synthesis of a truncated ETV4 protein,
starting in ETV4 exon 4a can now be predicted (Fig. 1D). Exclusive
usage of CANT1 exon 1a as first exon in CANT1-ETV4 fusion
transcripts might have various explanations, including the positions
of breakpoints of the specific genomic rearrangement and the
prostate-specific expression of transcripts starting at exon 1a.
In prostate cancer, TMPRSS2 is the common fusion partner of
the ETS family members ERG, ETV1, and ETV4. Recently, several
novel ETV1 fusion partners have been identified: SLC45A3, HERVK_22q11.23, C15orf21, and HNRPA2B1 (11), with different expression characteristics. Based on expression profiles, the fusion
partners were divided into distinct classes of ETV1 rearrangements,
separating prostate-specific, androgen up-regulated genes and

down-regulated genes, and ubiquitously regulated genes. Recently,
we identified three novel ETV1 fusion partners: FOXP1, HERVK17,
and EST14.4 Both HERVK17 and EST14 have a prostate-specific and
androgen-induced expression pattern; FOXP1 seems expressed in
many tissues. The three ETV4 partners identified, TMPRSS2, KLK2,
and CANT1, show identical expression profiles: up-regulation by
androgens and prostate-specificity.
The common expression pattern of ETV4 fusion partners
indicates a similar mechanism of gene fusion. It is tempting to
speculate that the genomic region of prostate-specific genes is
unstable in a specific cell type. Based on the stem cell/progenitor
cell concept of tumor development (17), progenitor cells of
the luminal epithelial prostate cells, in which expression of the
prostate-specific fusion partners is expected to be activated, are
interesting candidates. In this regard, we could confirm TMPRSS2
induction during development of the mouse prostate.4 Unfortunately, there are no appropriate mouse counterparts of KLK2 and
CANT1(exon 1a).

A second process that might play a role in a common
mechanism of gene fusion includes the nuclear compartmentalization of gene expression. It might be proposed that prostatespecific genes are all expressed in a limited number of nuclear
compartments, or so-called transcription factories (18, 19).
Possibly, ETV4 is expressed in the same compartments. In
accordance with the latter hypothesis, it has recently been shown
that IGH and cMYC, which are fusion partners in Burkitt
lymphoma and plasmacytoma, are preferentially expressed in the
same nuclear regions at in vitro B cell stimulation (20).
Taken together, the results from this study show that ETV4
has multiple fusion partners and highlight the importance of
