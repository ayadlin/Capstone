ABSTRACT
Metastasis currently remains the predominant cause of breast carcinoma
treatment failure. The effective targeting of metastasis-related-pathways in cancer
holds promise for a new generation of therapeutics. In this study, we developed an
novel Asp-UA conjugate, which was composed of classical “old drug” aspirin and
low toxicity natural product ursolic acid for targeting breast cancer metastasis. Our
results showed that Asp-UA could attenuate the adhesion, migration and invasion
of breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a more safe and effective manner
in vitro. Molecular and cellular study demonstrated that Asp-UA significantly downregulated the expression of cell adhesion and invasion molecules including integrin
α6β1, CD44 ,MMP-2, MMP-9, COX-2, EGFR and ERK proteins, and up-regulated the
epithelial markers “E-cadherin” and “β-catenin”, and PTEN proteins. Furthermore,
Asp-UA (80 mg/kg) reduced lung metastasis in a 4T1 murine breast cancer metastasis
model more efficiently, which was associated with a decrease in the expression of
CD44. More importantly, we did not detect side effects with Asp-UA in mice such as
weight loss and main viscera tissues toxicity. Overall, our research suggested that codrug Asp-UA possessed potential metastasis chemoprevention abilities via influencing
EMT and EGFR-mediated pathways and could be a more promising drug candidate for
the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

side-effects and often lacks the ability to selectively target
the cancer metastasis cascade, leading to distant relapse
and repeated recurrence. Therefore, it is urgently needed to
find safe and efficient cancer metastasis preventive agents
for cancer survivors in this disease.
Metastasis is thought to begin with the epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cascade of events
in which tumor cells lose many of their ‘epithelial’
characteristics and become more like mesenchymal cells
with the ability to spread and invade into the extracellular
matrix (ECM) [4]. Extensive studies have shown EMT
plays an important role in cancer metastasis [4–6]. The
EMT process is very complicated and controlled by
different signaling pathways, including cell adhesion

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of
cancer mortality worldwide [1]. Every year above
1.3 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer
and nearly 450,000 women die from it. Invasion and
metastasis, which is estimated to be responsible for
approximately 90% of all cancer deaths [2, 3], is the
primary factor that results in the failure of breast cancer
treatment and poor prognosis. Traditional therapies of
breast cancer include some surgery, radiation therapy and
chemotherapy, among which chemotherapy still remains
the backbone for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
However, traditional chemotherapy brings about severe

molecules (CAMs), MMPs, COX, TGF-β, Wnt, MAPK,
EGFR, PIP3 and others [7, 8]. Therefore, inhibiting EMT
pathway of cancer cells as well as intervening with the key
proteins in its related pathways should shed light on breast
cancer progression and be informative for potential cancer
metastasis chemopreventives.
Ursolic acid (UA), 3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28oicacid, is an ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenic acid
found in a variety of medicinal herbs and edible plants.
It exhibits comprehensive biologic properties, such as
anti-inflammatory [9], anti-angiogenesis [10], anti-cancer
[11, 12] and liver protection [13], in a variety of human
diseases. Recently, it has attracted considerable attention
for its activities towards different cancers [14, 15]. In
particular, it has the advantage of low toxicity, which
makes it suitable for cancer metastatic chemoprevention.
Prasad S et al. reported that ursolic acid can inhibit the
metastasis of colorectal cancer through the suppression
of multiple biomarkers linked to invasion, angiogenesis,
and metastasis [16]. Jedinák A et al. found that UA
significantly decreased the number of B16 colonies in the
lungs of mice [17]. Our recent studies demonstrated that
UA and its derivative US597, could safely and effectively
suppress cancer metastasis both in vitro and in vivo,
and are being developed as a novel cancer metastasis
chemopreventive agent by us [18]. Various cellular targets
and pathways have been proposed as to the mechanism of
UA’s anti-metastasis effects, including: integrin-mediated
focal adhesion pathway [18], extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) pathway [19], epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) [16] and MMPs [20] pathways, and
suppressing several key molecules associated with cancer
metastasis [21]. Overall, UA demonstrates extensive
metastasis chemopreventive effects through multiple
targets and pathways.
Aspirin (Asp), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID), is extensively used in clinical to treat
rheumatism and prevent cardiovascular disease [22].
Recently, its therapeutic and prophylactic effects with
regard to tumor metastasis are gaining widespread
interest [23–26]. Maity et al. reported that aspirin could
increase the expression of a set of markers, indicating a
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in human
breast carcinoma, which are most likely mediated through
COX-dependent or independent pathways [27]. Jiang et al.
showed that aspirin exerted anti-metastasis efficacy
through inhibiting the expression of PI3K/AKT, ERK,
NF-κB, CX3CL1, CD44 and MMPs [28, 29]. Very
recently, we showed that a combination of aspirin and
low toxicity drugs lysine, metapristone and doxycycline
could prevent and treat tumor metastasis [30]. Therefore,
aspirin also displays huge prospects in pre-metastatic
chemoprevention.
In the present study, we firstly designed and
synthesized a novel amphiphilic Asp-UA conjugate
by combining the classical “old drug” aspirin and the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

natural anticancer product ursolic acid. The metastasis
chemopreventive effect of Asp-UA co-drug on the
adhesion-migration-invasion cascade of breast cancer
cells were investigated at non-cytotoxic concentrations
in vitro. Further, by applying multiple techniques
including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry
and immunofluorescence, the underlying molecular
mechanism of Asp-UA on the EMT and EGFR-mediated
signaling pathways in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer
cells were explored. Additionally, we evaluated whether
Asp-UA had a potential for the prevention or treatment of
cancer metastasis in vivo by the 4T1 murine breast cancer
lung metastasis model.

RESULTS
Synthesis and characterization of Asp-UA
To search for more safe and effective drug
candidates for the prevention and treatment of cancer
metastasis, we firstly synthesized the conjugate of the
“old drug” aspirin and natural product UA. UA and Asp
were used as the parent compounds and the structure
modifications were performed at the C-28 position of
UA. The synthesis route of conjugate Asp-UA was
depicted in Figure 1. It was fully characterized by
various spectroscopic methods, including infrared (IR),
1
H-NMR and high resolution mass spectra (HRMS).
IR and MS spectra were provided in Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S1. UA was esterified to give AspUA of white powder with yield of 70.51%. Corresponding
characterization of Asp-UA were as follows: 1H NMR

calculated for C39H54O6Na, 641.3813, found, 641.3820.
NMR spectra of Asp and Asp-UA with indicated
peaks were illustrated in Supplementary Figure S2 and
Supplementary Figure S3. Purity of Asp-UA was confirmed
to be ≥ 95% by HPLC (Supplementary Figure S4).

Effect of Asp-UA on cell viability
To explore the metastasis chemoprevention function
of Asp-UA, the cytostatic effects of the conjugate on
different breast cancer cells and normal cells were firstly
evaluated. The dose-dependent cell viabilities of four
different cell lines treated with UA, Asp and Asp-UA for
24 hours were depicted in Figure 2. Asp-UA exhibited
modest cytotoxic effects on human breast cancer cell
lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and murine breast cancer
cell line 4T1 with an IC50 value of 72.16, 63.94 and
62.03 μM, respectively (Table 1). Free UA showed
more suppressive cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 37.50,
73115

42.32 and 23.33 μM, respectively (Table 1). Asp exerted
negligible cytotoxicity at various tested concentrations and
only exhibited certain cytotoxicity at mM concentrations
(Table 1). In the mean time, Asp-UA inhibited normal
human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) viability at a
much higher concentration with an IC50 value of >100 μM
(Table 1). By comparison, the cytotoxicity of Asp-UA was
very low at the concentration of 10~40 μM. Based on the
cytotoxicity results, concentrations with negligible low
toxicity (10–40 μM) were then chosen for further studies
to explore the metastasis chemoprevention effects of AspUA in vitro.

in a dose dependent-manner (Figure 3A). In comparison
with control group, the adhesion of MCF-7 cells to matrix
was reduced by 32% and 51% (p < 0.01), respectively
after treatment of 10 and 20 µM Asp-UA. Meanwhile,
the adhesion of MCF-7 cells treated with 20 µM of UA
were inhibited only by 34% (p < 0.05). Compared with the
control group, the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells was
reduced by 38% and 60% (p < 0.01) in 10 and 20 µM
Asp-UA-treated groups, respectively. Interestingly, Asp
alone exerts a slight effect in the tested concentrations
(Figure 3A and Figure 3B).
Cell invasion is an important characteristic of
malignant tumor cells compared with normal cells or
benign tumor cells. To assess the ability of breast cancer
cells to invade through matrigel, a transwell insert system
was used to monitor the invasive process of breast cancer
cells. As shown in Figure 3A, the average number of
invaded MCF-7 cells was 488 ± 5, 426 ± 3 and 440 ± 6 in
control, free UA, and Asp groups, respectively. However,
in the Asp-UA treatment group of 20μM, only 242 ± 5 cells
invaded through the monolayer membrane (Figure 3A).
It’s notable that under the same concentration of 20 μM,
Asp-UA exhibited an inhibition rate of 50.32%, while UA
and Asp showed 12.54% (p < 0.05) and 9.7%, respectively
(Figure 3C). The inhibition efficiency of Asp-UA over
free UA or Asp was evident with significant statistics
difference. Moreover, using this matrigel invasion

Effect of Asp-UA on the adhesion, invasion and
migration of tumor cells in vitro
The adhesion-dependent migration in tumor tissue
is an important prerequisite for cancer cell dissemination
[31, 32]. To determine whether Asp-UA affects the
metastasis of breast cancer cells at non-cytotoxic
concentrations in vitro, the cell-ECM adhesion, transwell
and wound healing assay were performed to evaluate the
adhesion, invasion and migration abilities of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3).
Within adhesion assay, we found that Asp-UA
treatment for 1 h was able to significantly inhibit the
adhesion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to matrigel

assay, the invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231, a highly
aggressive breast cancer cell line, was also significant
reduced by Asp-UA (Figure 3C).
The cell scratch assay demonstrated that the
migration ability of MCF-7 and MD-MBA-231 cells in
Asp-UA treated group was much lower than that in free
UA, Asp or control group. The conjugate suppressed
the migration in a significant dose-and-time-dependent

manner in both two breast cancer cells (Figure 3A and
Figure 3D). Furthermore, the migration assay showed
that there were no significant inhibition effects in the
two groups of UA and Asp, their effects were inferior to
Asp-UA (Figure 3D). The above anti-metastasis results
confirmed that Asp-UA was more potent than UA or Asp
in inhibiting the adhesion, invasion and migration of breast
cancer cells in vitro.

Asp-UA down-regulates the mRNA and protein
expression of cell adhesion molecules Integrin

decrease in CD44 expression by 24.35%, 51.14%, and
64.19%, respectively (Figure 4A, 4B and Supplementary
Figure S5). Meanwhile, similar trends were detected in
another cell lines MDA-MB-231(results not shown),
except for only a weaker effect for integrin β1. Under
the same concentration, Asp-UA treatment was more
efficacious than UA or Asp treatment alone. These results
demonstrated that Asp-UA possessed better metastasis
chemoprevention effects from the perspective of cell
adhesion molecules (CAMs).
In addition, quantitative real-time PCR method
(Figure 4C) also verified that mRNA levels of these
CAMs were significantly reduced in MCF-7 cells. The
results of qRT-PCR assay were similar with that obtained
from the flow cytometry and western blotting analysis.
The mRNA expression was significantly lower in the AspUA (40 µM) treated group than that in the control group
(P < 0.01). UA and Asp also inhibited the expression of
the corresponding mRNA, while the level of these mRNA
showed no prominent change compared with Asp-UA.

To verify the accurate molecular targets that AspUA affects the adhesion, invasion and migration of breast
cancer cells, the expressions of various cell adhesion
molecules (CAMs) on breast cancer cell surface were
evaluated after exposure to UA, Asp, and Asp-UA,
respectively. The protein expressions were quantitatively
analyzed by flow cytometry. Among all the detecting
proteins, we found integrin α6, β1 and CD44 proteins
in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly
down-regulated after treatment with Asp-UA for 24 h. As
shown in Figure 4A, 4B and Supplementary Figure S5,
when the MCF-7 cells were treated with 10, 20 and 40 μM
Asp-UA, the fluorescence intensity of integrin α6 was
inhibited by 28.55%, 39.24% and 51.76% respectively
and β1 for 26.71%, 34.73% and 49.32%, respectively.
Moreover, the Asp-UA treatment also caused a significant

Asp-UA down-regulates cell invasion molecules
MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2 in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells

We further detected the expression levels of integrin
α6, β1 and CD44 by western blot method. As shown in
Figure 4D and 4E, Asp-UA dose-dependently inhibited the
expression of integrin α6, β1 and CD44 in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 4D) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4E) after the
Asp-UA treatment for 24 h. In MDA-MB-231cells, the
inhibition effects were similar except for integrin β1, which
has no obvious increase or decrease trend (Figure 4E).
Meanwhile, a strong down-regulation of CD44 protein
was detected in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells after the
Asp-UA treatment for 24 h (Figure 4C and Figure 4E).

Due to the fact that Asp-UA could decrease the
expression of CAMs, we further assessed the expression
of crucial proteins including MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2,
which are critical functional molecules within the tumor
invasion process in breast cancer cells. As shown in
Figure 5A and Figure 5B, Asp-UA (10, 20, 40μM) clearly
reduced the expression levels of COX-2 and downstream

Effect of Asp-UA on experimental lung
metastasis in vivo

MMP-2, MMP-9 proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In the Asp
(1 mM) treated group, the expression of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 proteins was obviously decreased, while the
expression of COX-2 protein had no obvious change.
Thus, Asp-UA can interfere with the invasion cascade
by suppressing the crucial proteins of cancer invasion
process.

To provide further evidence for the inhibition effect
of Asp-UA on cancer metastasis in vivo, we examined the
anti-metastatic efficacy of Asp-UA with a 4T1 murine
artificial pulmonary metastatic model. The 4T1 cell
line is a highly metastatic murine breast cancer with a
proclivity for lung metastasis. As shown in Figure 6A
(a) and Figure 6B, the number of metastatic foci at lung
surfaces was significantly reduced in Asp-UA treated sets
as compared with those of the other sets, supporting the
assumption that Asp-UA may have anti-metastasis effect
in vivo. In addition, the H&E staining further conﬁrmed
that the Asp-UA therapy reduced the metastatic tumor
burden in the lungs in a disseminated breast cancer model
(Figure 6A (b)).
Meanwhile, Figure 6C depicted that there were no
obvious body weight change in Asp-UA-treated groups
(including 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). Additionally, using
H&E staining, histological sections of heart, liver, spleen,
kidney and small intestine showed that Asp-UA didn’t
manifest any obvious toxicity as treated tissue sections
appeared similar to that of control (Figure 7A). The main
shortcoming of aspirin regimes is their gastrointestinal
toxicity and the gastric mucosal toxicity assay showed
that UA (80 mg/Kg) and Asp-UA (80 mg/Kg) didn’t cause
any congestion, corrosive focus, ulcer or lesions on the
stomach tissue, while in Asp-treated group (80 mg/Kg)
the prolapse of gastric mucosa and multiple bleeding
points were observed (Figure 7B). Overall, these results
suggested that the new compound Asp-UA didn’t elicit
obvious viscera tissues toxicity.
The above research clearly showed that the Asp-UA
conjugate could suppress metastasis of 4T1 cells to the
lungs, more potently than that of free UA or Asp alone.
The therapy yielded significant anti-metastasis effects with
no obvious toxicity in the 4T1 murine metastasis model.
Therefore, it could be concluded that Asp-UA slowed the
progression of breast cancer metastasis without observable
adverse effects in vivo.

Asp-UA inhibits EMT-related signaling pathway
To investigate whether Asp-UA suppress EMTrelated signaling pathway, we detected the relevant
molecules in protein level with flow cytometry and western
blot. FACS analysis (Figure 5C and Figure 5F) showed
that 10, 20 and 40 μM Asp-UA treatment significantly
increased E-cadherin expression by 28.72%, 35.64%,
and 50.85%, respectively in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore,
the WB results were consistent with FACS for E-cadherin
in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5D). Interestingly, the expression
of E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells was very low, and
the expression of E-cadherin was not up-regulated or
down-regulated by the treatment of UA, Asp and Asp-UA
(Figure 5E). We furtherly detected the β-catenin protein
by western blot method. The expression of β-catenin
significantly increased after Asp-UA treatment in MCF-7
cells (Figure 5D) and in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5E).
These results demonstrated that Asp-UA could interfere
the tumor EMT-related process and therefore, further
inhibit the metastasis of breast cancer.

Asp-UA inhibits the EGFR-mediated signaling
pathway in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
To verify if Asp-UA can suppress EGFR-mediated
signaling pathway, we detected several pivotal proteins
in this signaling pathway by western blot assay. It turned
out that Asp-UA could enhance the expression level of
PTEN and reduce the expression levels of EGFR and ERK
(Figure 5D and Figure 5E). Compared with UA or Asp,
the regulation effects were remarkable when cells were
treated with Asp-UA. Our results revealed that Asp-UA
could inhibit EGFR-mediated pathway through increasing
or decreasing the expression of proteins associated with
cancer metastasis.
To confirm whether Asp-UA could inhibit the
activity of EGFR, confocal imaging was performed
to visualize its expression in MCF-7 cells. As a result,
we found EGFR was mainly localized in the plasma
membrane, with high expression in red fluorescence
(Figure 5G) and the nucleus was stained in blue
fluorescence with DAPI. However, the fluorescence
intensity of EGFR was strongly reduced after treatment
with Asp-UA (40 μM) for 24 h (Figure 5G).

Asp-UA inhibits the CD44 expression on the lung
tissue of tumor metastatic mice
CD44 promotes migration and proliferation through
interaction with many signaling molecules and it is a
promising target for therapy in breast carcinoma. In
order to observe the effects of Asp-UA on the expression
of CD44 in vivo, the immunohistochemical staining
method was used to analyze the expression of CD44 in
lung tissues of metastatic mice. As shown in Figure 4,
Asp-UA can efficiently down-regulate the expression of
CD44 in breast cancer cells. Consistently, inhibition of

CD44 expression in lung tissue was also detected by this
IHC assay (Figure 6A (c)), which verified the effects of
Asp-UA in vivo. Quantification analysis showed that the
expression of CD44 was significantly decreased in AspUA treated group (Figure 6D). By comparison, a weaker
inhibition was found in Asp or UA alone treated group.

Breast cancer metastatic relapse accounts for
90% lethality of the disease. At present, plant materials
possessing anti-metastasis activities are attractive
candidates for anti-cancer agents. A vast amount

of literature has documented the significant antiangiogenesis, anti-adhesion and anti-invasion bioactivities
of UAs, an important natural product and its derivatives
[33–35]. Aspirin, the commonly used anti-pyretic and
analgesic drug, has also demonstrated its anti-invasion
and anti-angiogenesis activities [36]. However, a high
dose of aspirin (~mM) is required to achieve the effect.
Here we designed a new conjugate Asp-UA to combat
cancer, especially targeting the cancer metastasis cascade.
Conventional drug development on anti-cancer aims at
seeking cytotoxic agents to kill cancer cells, which also
brings tremendous damage to normal cells. Completely
different from the traditions, our strategy was directed at
blocking the initiation of the adhesion-invasion-migration
cascade of cancer metastasis with the hypothesis that if
tumor cells fail to adhere the endothelial layer or ECM,
invade and migrate through the tumor surrounding tissue,

they may lose part or all of their metastatic capacities.
In our study, the results showed that Asp-UA effectively
inhibited the migration, invasion and adhesion abilities of
breast cancer cells in vitro in a low μM range (Figure 3),
indicating a complementary synergistic effect of the
ligation of two drugs.
Adhesion of cancer cells to ECM or vascular
endothelium is a crucial starting point of metastasis [37].
These adhesion interactions are mediated by cellular
adhesion molecules (CAMs), like integrin and cadherin
[38], and the expression of these molecules play a major
role in the adhesion process of tumor cells. We detected
the expression of various CAMs on the surface of MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells. Our flow cytometry results
demonstrated that treatment of the two cell lines with AspUA could reduce the expression of integrin α6, β1, CD44
(Figure 4A and Figure 4B) and promote the expression

of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5C and Figure 5F),
implying that integrin α6β1/CD44/E-cadherin on MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 surface were partly responsible for the
mechanism of Asp-UA on cancer metastasis prevention.
The results also indicated that Asp-UA could block
the tumor adhesion process via influencing the CAMs
expressions.
The initial invasive action of metastatic cells
involves interaction of tumor cells with the ECM, that
is, cell matrix adhesion and then the ECM degradation.
Accumulated studies have revealed that aspirin and UAs
exhibit critical anti-metastatic effects via interference with
MMP-mediated cell-matrix interaction [28, 39, 40–43]. In
the present study, the effects of Asp-UA on the expression
of MMP-2, MMP-9 and COX-2 proteins were determined.
The results indicated that 10–40 μM Asp-UA effectively
inhibited their expression in breast cancer cells in a dosedependent manner (Figure 5A and Figure 5B). However,
UA or Asp alone did not exhibit obvious inhibitory effect
on the above-mentioned three proteins. This suggested that
Asp-UA had a complementary synergistic effect on breast
cancer metastasis by suppressing the expression of key
proteins in breast cancer invasion.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an
initial process which is associated with cancer metastasis
[44]. EMT-related markers, such as E-cadherin and
β-catenin, could sustain the epithelial phenotype and play
critical roles in EMT transformation [45, 46]. In addition,
extensive studies have revealed that high CD44 expression
was correlated with EMT [47]. CD44 could disassociate
the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex and release β-catenin
into nucleus, leading the activation of genes related to
cell invasion and migration [47]. The functions of these

molecules have been reported by many researchers and
their clinical potentials are very large due to their alert
effects for early cancer metastasis [6, 48–50]. Our study
demonstrated that Asp-UA was able to increase the
expression of E-cadherin/ β-catenin, and decrease the
CD44 expression (Figure 4 and Figure 6). The results
suggested that Asp-UA effectively inhibited invasion and
migration of breast cancer, maybe in part, via inducing
significant changes of EMT-related proteins which then
brought about the reversal of EMT.
Activation and over-expression of EGFR play
significant roles in the invasion and metastasis cascade
of breast cancer. Prasad S et al. demonstrated that one of
the mechanisms that UA used to inhibit metastasis was
that UA might block the EGFR-mediated pathway within
tumor cells [39]. In our study, we identified Asp-UA
suppressed the expression of EGFR and ERK, and
elevated PTEN expression level separately in Asp-UAtreated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5), which
supported the fact that the inhibitory effects of Asp-UA
on cell adhesion and invasion were partly associated with
EGFR-mediated signaling pathway. All the above results
showed that Asp-UA was able to modulate the expression
of proteins involved in the metastasis cascade including
adhesion, invasion and migration related molecules in
breast cancer cells (Figure 8). Our data also suggested that
Asp-UA may exert its metastasis chemoprevention effects
by suppressing EMT and EGFR-mediated signaling
regulator expression. The molecular research increases
the understanding of the anti-metastatic mechanism of
Asp-UA and provides evidence for the development of
Asp-UA for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer
metastasis.

To establish the relevance of these in vitro findings,
the in vivo anti-metastasis effects of Asp-UA were further
investigated in a mouse model of established pulmonary
metastasis. We found the Asp-UA treatment resulted in
remarkable reduction of lung metastasis (Figure 6A and
Figure 6B), accompanied by significant down-regulation
of the CD44 biomarker in vivo. In addition, we didn’t
detect obvious body weight change and significant
abnormalities or lesions of main viscera tissues in
Asp-UA-treated mice (Figure 6C and Figure 7). This
observation demonstrated the application potential of
Asp-UA in live systems. Our in vivo study also suggested
Asp-UA possessed higher anti-metastasis efficacy with
lower toxicity in comparison with UA or Asp alone.
Oncologic therapeutic agent of high-efficiency and lowtoxicity is an area of unmet clinical need [51]. The present
study indicated that Asp-UA was effective in prevention
and treatment of breast cancer metastasis, especially low
toxic to the hosts, which could manifest a high clinical

value. This kind of novel compounds could be combined
with the current chemotherapeutic drugs or surgical
approaches to have a profound therapeutic impact in the
clinical applicaiton.

to pellet food and water in a controlled environment of
20–25°C, with lighting on from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM.
All animals used in these investigations were handled in
accordance with protocol procedures, approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fuzhou
University. All efforts were made to minimize the animals
suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

Cell viability measurement
The cytotoxicity of UA, Asp and Asp-UA was
investigated by the MTT assay as previously described
by this lab [52, 53]. Various cells including MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, 4T1 and HMEC were treated with UA,
Asp or Asp-UA of indicated concentration for 24 hours.
Cell viability was determined by detecting the absorbance
at 570 nm using an infinite M200 Pro microplate reader
(Tecan, Switzerland), triplicate wells were analyzed at
each dose.

Preparation of ursolic acid–aspirin conjugate
To a solution of 0.5 g Asp (2.78 mmol), 2 mL oxalyl
chloride and one drop of dimethyl formamide in 20 mL
dry dichloromethane was stirred at 25°C for 10 h. The
reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure
to remove solvent. Then 20 mL dry dichloromethane was
added in reaction mixture. Add a solution of 1.27 g of
UA (2.78 mmol) and 0.1 eq DMAP in 20 mL of pyridine
from the dropping funnel over a period of 30 minutes.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 25°C for 10 h. After
stirring, the reaction mixture was concentrated under
reduced pressure to remove dichloromethane. 100 mL
water was added and stirred at 25°C for 20 minutes. Then
the reaction mixture was filtered to get crude product.
The reaction mixture was purified on silica gel column
using ethyl acetate: petroleum ether (v/v, 1:6) as eluents to
give compound Asp-UA. All reactions were performed in
oven-dried glassware. Yields refer to crystallised material
or homogeneous products (TLC) obtained by column
chromatography. All final compounds were purified to
>  95% purity, as determined by a HPLC Breeze from
Waters Co. using an Atlantis T3 5.0 μM 4.6 mm × 150 mm
reverse phase column (Supplementary Figure S4).

Adhesion assay
The adhesion assay of MCF-7 cells to the matirgel
was assessed according to the method described
previously by this lab with minor modifications [18, 54].
Matrigel protein were diluted to appropriate concentration
and pretreat 96-well culture plates with this matrigel
for 12 h. Rhodamine 123-labeled MCF-7 cells were cocultured with the matrigel protein in each well, followed
by treatment with UA, Asp and Asp-UA for 1 hour. The
non-adherent tumor cells were removed from the plate
by washing with PBS, and the tumor cells bound to the
matrigel were measured by ﬂuorescence microscopy
(Zeiss, Germany). The mean inhibition of adhesion for ten
visual fields was calculated by using the equation: percent
of control adhesion = [the number of adhered cells in
treated samples/the number of adhered cells in the control
group] × 100%.

Cell lines and cell culture

Invasion assay

Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 cells,
mouse 4T1 breast tumor cells and the normal human
mammary epithelial cell line HMEC were purchased
from the cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology.
MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in L-15
and DMEM medium separately and the other cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with fetal
bovine serum (FBS, 10%), penicillin (100 U/mL) and
streptomycin (100 μg/mL) in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 at 37°C.

Inhibition capacity against invasion of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells was estimated by transwell invasion
assay as we described previously [18]. Briefly, in transwell
cell culture chambers, 8 μM pore-sized transwell inserts
in 24-well plate were coated with matrigel on the upper
surface. The lower chambers were added with 750 μL of
medium containing 20% FBS. MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231
cells were resuspended with reduced serum DMEM or
L-15 medium and adjust the density to 2.5 × 105/mL , and
then cell suspension (200 µL) containing UA, Asp or Asp
-UA were seeded onto the upper chamber wells. After 24 h
incubation, the cells that had invaded through the matrigel
membrane were fixed in methanol and stained with 0.1%
crystal violet for 20 min. Soft remove the cells on the
inner layer with a cotton swab. The filters were washed
with PBS and images were taken. The invading cells

expression was quantified by use of Image Lab analysis
software (Bio-Rad).

Total RNA isolation and quantitative real-time
PCR

Migration assay

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIZOL
Reagents (Invitrogen). A sample (1 µg) of total RNA
was used to generate cDNA templates by RT reaction
with the PrimeScript® RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
first strand cDNA products were used as PCR templates
and the PCR amplificationwas performed in a 25 µL
reaction volume using a SYBR®Premix Ex Taq™ PCR
kit (Takara, Dalian, China), using SYBR-Green real-time
PCR method on the CFX96TM Real-Time PCR Detection
Systems (Bio-Rad). The sequences are 5′-TCCCTGAA
CCTAACGGAGTCT-3′ and 5′-ATGTCCAAGTAGTTCA
GTTTG-3′ for integrin α6, 5′-ACAGCAGAGAAGCTGA
AGCCA-3′ and 5′-GAGCTTAGCTGGTGTTGTGC-3′ for
integrin β1, 5′-AGACGAAGACAGTCCCTGGATCAC-3′
and 5′-TGTGTTTGCTCCACCTTCTTGACTC-3′ for
CD44, 5′-TGGCACCCAGCACAATGAA-3′ and 5′-CATA
GTCATAGTCCGCCTAGAAGCA-3′ for β-actin. Target
mRNA expression levels were normalized with the β-actin
mRNA and the relative changes of gene expression
were measured using the 2−ΔΔCT method. Results are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three
independent experiments.

Scratch assay was performed to analyze cell
migration in vitro, as described in our previous work
[18]. The MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well plate;
once confluent, a perpendicular scratch was generated
in the surface of the plate using a pipette tip, followed
by extensive washing with serum-free medium to
remove cell debris, then incubated with DMEM medium
containing 0.5% FBS and treated with or without UA,
Asp and Asp-UA for 24 h and 48 h. Photographic images
were taken from each well at indicated time after drug
treatment, using a light microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The
distance that cells migrated through the marked area was
determined by measuring the wound width at 24 h/48 h
after treatment, and comparing it with the wound width at
0 h. The experiment was repeated three times.

Flow cytometry
This experiment was conducted as we described
previously [55]. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
were grown on 6-well tissue culture plates followed by
treatment with different concentration of UA, Asp and
Asp-UA for 24 h. The cells were collected and incubated
at 4°C for 30 min in the dark with the primary antibodies.
Cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, Vimentin, EpCAM
and integrin (α1, α3, α5, α6 and β1) expression on
cell-surface were measured by BD FACS AriaIII flow
cytometry. The data were processed by FlowJo software
and expressed as the mean fluorescent intensities.

In vivo tumor growth and metastasis assay
Subconfluent 4T1 cells were harvested and
resuspended in PBS to a final density of 1 × 105 cells/mL.
Then inject 200 μL into the tail vein of female BALB/C
mice. On the following day (Day 1), mice were randomly
divided into six groups (n = 8 for each group) and then
normal solvent (CMC-Na (control)), UA (80 mg/kg),
Asp (80 mg/kg) and Asp-UA (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg),
respectively, were administered to mice for 28 days via
orally gavage. Mice weight were measured every other
day. After the treatment, the mice were sacrificed by
cervical dislocation after euthanizing with isoflurane
(3%). The heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and small
intestine were dissected, washed with PBS and fixed in
10% (v/v) buffered formaldehyde. These tissues were
then paraffin embedded and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). The number of surface tumor nodules was
counted visually with the aid of a dissecting microscope
and histological observations were performed under a
microscope (Zeiss, Germany).

Western blotting analysis
Western blotting was performed as previously
described [18]. Briefly, cell lysates were collected using
immunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer. Samples with
equivalent amounts of denatured proteins were resolved
by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. After electrophoretic
separation, proteins were transferred to a polyvinyldene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membranes were
washed for ten minutes with TBS and were blocked by
blocking solution. After washed the blots with TBST
for three times, membrane was probed with the primary
antibody diluted 1:1000 in TBST solution overnight at
4°C, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000
in TBST solution for 2 h at 37°C. After the membranes
were washed with TBST and TBS, the proteins of
interest were detected by using SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate kit and detected by using the
ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). The target proteins

respectively, were administered to mice for 7 days via

adhesion-invasion-migration cascade of MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells by down-regulating the relevant
functional molecules. These effects were accompanied
by suppressing the EMT and EGFR-mediated pathways.
Moreover, Asp-UA also undermined the progression of
pulmonary metastasis for 4T1 cells in female BALB/C
mice without obvious side effects such as weight loss
and main viscera tissues. Taken together, this newlydiscovered activity of Asp-UA makes it best-suited
for the development of chemo-preventive drugs for
cancer metastasis. Our results will promote better use of
existing drugs and facilitate the design of more complex
therapeutic approaches to target advanced malignancies,
and more importantly, provide a molecular basis for
clinical evaluation of Asp-UA as a potential cancer
metastatic chemopreventive agent.

CD44 immunohistochemistry
Frozen sections with the thickness of 6μm were
stained with anti-CD44 antibody as previously described
[48]. The presence of the CD44 protein was visualized by
DAB staining and examined under a microscope. Results
for CD44 positive cells are shown as ×200 magniﬁcation.
Positive signals of CD44 IHC showed brow-yellow
cytoplasmic staining. To quantitatively examine the
number of CD44 positive cells, ten ﬁelds from each
tissue section were randomly selected, photographed and
analyzed with the MIQAS analysis system (Biological
technology Corp., Shanghai, China).

Immunofluorescence microscopy
MCF-7 cells grown on 35 mm cell culture dish
with 105 cells were co-cultured with different drugs and
then rinsed three times using PBS. Subsequently, the cells
were fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min.
The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and
