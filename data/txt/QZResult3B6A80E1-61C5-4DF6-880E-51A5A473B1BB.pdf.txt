ABSTRACT
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade is a key regulatory pathway
controlling cell growth and survival, and its dysregulation is a reported feature of
B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-pre ALL).
Torin-2 is a novel, second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitor that is potent
and selective for mTOR with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors.
It has been shown that Torin-2 displayed dramatic antiproliferative activity across a
panel of cancer cell lines.
To investigate if Torin-2 could represent a new option for the treatment of B-pre
ALL, we tested its activity on a panel of B-pre ALL cell lines. In all of them Torin-2
showed a powerful cytotoxic activity, inhibiting the growth of each cell line in a dosedependent manner, with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. Torin-2 caused both apoptosis
and autophagy, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and affected both mTORC1
and mTORC2 activities as assessed by their specific substrate dephosphorylation.
Torin-2 alone suppressed feedback activation of PI3K/Akt, whereas the mTORC1
inhibitor RAD001 required the addition of the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 to achieve the
same effect. These pharmacological strategies targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR at different
points of the signaling pathway cascade might represent a new promising therapeutic
strategy for treatment of B-pre ALL patients.

INTRODUCTION

telangiectasia-mutated]- and Rad3-related kinase) [1, 2].
mTOR plays a pivotal role in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway, which senses growth factor and serves
as a central regulator of fundamental cellular processes
such as cell growth/apoptosis, autophagy, translation, and
metabolism [3, 4]. Activation of PI3K recruits cellular
protein kinases that in turn activate downstream kinases,
including the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Phosphorylation

mTOR is a highly conserved and widely
expressed serine/threonine kinase, that is a member of
the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–like kinase (PIKK)
family, which also includes other protein kinases that
regulate DNA damage responses, such as ATM (ataxia
telangiectasia-mutated kinase) and ATR (ATM [ataxia

of Akt activates the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and
induces subsequent phosphorylation of S6K, and of
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1). The activation of mTORC1 results in
increased translation and protein synthesis [5]. A second
complex of mTOR, known as mTORC2, has been more
recently described and appears to act as a feedback loop
via Akt [6].
Gene deletions/mutations and functional impairment
of many proteins involved in this signaling pathway lead
to a deregulation that results in different human cancers,
including hematological malignancies. Furthermore
hyperactivation of this pathway through loss of negative
regulators, such as PTEN, or mutational activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases upstream of phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) is a frequent occurrence in leukemia
patients, where it negatively influences response to
therapeutic treatments [7]. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy and
B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-pre ALL)
is the most frequent pediatric ALL subtype, characterized
by an aggressive neoplastic disorder of early lymphoid
precursor cells [8, 9]. The treatment protocol for B-pre
ALL includes an intense chemotherapy regimen with cure
rates of 15–80% [10, 11].
In B-pre ALL many research efforts are currently
devoted to the development of targeted therapies to limit
side effects of chemotherapy and to increase treatment
efficacy for poor prognosis patients, i.e. poor outcome
following relapse [12, 13]. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
activation is a frequent feature in B-pre ALL [12] and
therefore this pathway is an attractive target to efficiently
treat this disease. A new class of ATP-competitive
mTOR inhibitors, such as Torin-2, have been shown to
potently target mTORC1 and mTORC2 [14]. Torin-2 is
also a potent inhibitor of ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK. This
compound exhibits an anti-tumour activity more broadbased and profound compared to the rapalogs that do not
fully inhibit mTORC1 and are unable to inhibit mTORC2
[15].
We therefore hypothesized that dual inhibition
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by Torin-2 would provide a
superior outcome in B-pre ALL as compared to inhibition
of mTORC1 obtained with RAD001 [16]. We tested the
cytotoxic activity of Torin-2 and its capability to prevent
Akt reactivation after mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition.
Furthermore we explored if dual targeting of mTORC1
and Akt, with RAD001 and MK-2206 respectively, might
achieve results similar to those obtained with Torin-2
alone.
Torin-2 displayed a powerful cytotoxic activity
with an IC50 in the nanomolar range, induced G0/G1
phase cell cycle arrest, modulated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway and caused apoptosis and autophagy in a dosedependent manner. Interestingly, feedback activation
of PI3K/Akt was suppressed by Torin-2 alone, whereas
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RAD001 required the addition of MK-2206 to achieve
the same efficacy. These findings indicates that mTORC1
and mTORC2 inhibition could be an attractive strategy to
develop innovative therapeutic protocols for the treatment
of B-pre ALL leukemia patients and to prevent Akt
reactivation after mTORC1 targeting.

RESULTS
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation status in
B-pre ALL cell lines
We first analyzed by Western blot the baseline
expression of key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway and their phosphorylation status in a panel
of human B-pre ALL cell lines (NALM-6, SEM, REH,
RS4;11, BV-173, SUP-B15, TOM-1). Three of these
cell lines, BV-173, SUP-B15 and TOM-1 are Ph+, since
they harbour the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Despite some
heterogeneity, all the B-pre ALL cell lines displayed
phosphorylation at the Ser 2448 and Ser 2481 (readout for
mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively) residues of mTOR
and at the Ser 473 residue of Akt, which are indicative of
the constitutive activation of this signaling pathway (Fig.
1).
We further explored the basal condition of
downstream targets of both kinases. In agreement with
the hyperactivated status of mTORC1, the ribosomal
protein S6 and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) were phosphorylated at Ser
235/236 and Thr 37/46 respectively (Fig. 1). A readout for
mTORC2 activity is represented by the phosphorylation
at the Ser 473 site of Akt. Hyperactivation of Akt resulted
in the phosphorylation at the Thr 32 site of Forkhead box
O3A (FoxO3A) (Fig. 1).

Torin-2 induces cytotoxicity, blocks cell cycle
progression at the G0/G1 phase and induces
autophagy
To determine whether Torin-2 could affect viability
of B-pre ALL cell lines, cells were incubated in the
presence of increasing concentrations of Torin-2 for 48h
and then analyzed by MTT assays. All cell lines resulted
sensitive to the drug, in a concentration-dependent
fashion, with the IC50 value that ranged between 0.07
µM and 0.19 µM (Fig. 2A). Given the importance of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the regulation
of cell proliferation, the effects of Torin-2 on cell cycle
progression were also investigated. SEM and BV-173
cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations
of Torin-2 for 24h, then cells were harvested, fixed and
stained with Propidium Iodide (PI) and analyzed with the
10035

MuseTM Cell Analyzer. The assay showed in both cell lines
a concentration-dependent increase of G0/G1 phase of cell
cycle and a simultaneous decrease in the S phase (Fig.
2B).
Autophagy can be a form of programmed cell death,
but is also involved in protective mechanisms against
apoptosis [17, 18]. To evaluate whether the treatment
with Torin-2 could lead to autophagy, we detected the
expression of LC3A/B I (non lipidated) and LC3A/B II
(lipidated) by Western blot in BV-173, SEM and NALM6 cells treated with increasing concentrations of Torin-2.
The expression levels of LC3A/B II gradually increased in
the three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C).
To verify whether autophagy was either a cell
survival or a cell death mechanism, we used the autophagy
inhibitor 3-MA (3-Methyladenine), which blocks an
early stage of autophagy by inhibiting the class III
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [19]. 3-MA alone did
not affect cell growth, even at the concentration of 10 µM
(cell viability was comparable to untreated cells), but cells
treated with 3-MA become significantly more resistant
to Torin-2 cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2D, upper panel). We
also employed Bafilomycin A1, another well established
autophagy inhibitor that inhibits vacuolar ATPase
(V-ATPase) and promotes the accumulation of autophagic
vacuoles [20]. As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2D,

the treatment with 4 µM Bafilomycin A1 confirmed that
inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the cytotoxic
effect of Torin-2. These results indicated that autophagy is
a critical determinant of the cytotoxic effects induced in
B-pre ALL cells by Torin-2.

Torin-2 causes pro-apoptotic effects on B-pre ALL
cell lines
To investigate whether the decreased viability
was related to apoptosis, cells were treated for 24h with
increasing concentrations of Torin-2 and analyzed by both
Western blot and DNA staining. Cleavage of poly(ADPribose)polymerase (PARP) in BV-173, SEM and NALM6 revealed the pro-apoptotic effect of Torin-2. REH and
SUP-B15 cells were treated with Torin-2 at 0.5 µM for
24h (Fig. 3A). DAPI staining revealed the morphological
changes associated with apoptosis, such as chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Fig.3B).
Apoptosis was further investigated by flow cytometric
analysis of Annexin V-stained samples, that showed in
NALM-6 and TOM-1 a significant and concentrationdependent increase of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3C, left panel).
To determine whether activated caspases are involved in
the apoptotic action of Torin-2, we examined the effects

mTOR on both the Ser 2448 and Ser 2481 residues. It
should be remembered that the phosphorylation of mTOR
on Ser 2481 is a mTORC2-selective autophosphorylation
site [21]. mTORC1 inhibition had functional effects on
two well known mTORC1 substrates, S6 and 4E-BP1.
S6 was completely dephosphorylated on the Ser 235/236
residue already at 50 nM concentration of Torin-2 in all
cell lines, whereas 4E-BP1 was fully dephosphorylated on
the Thr 37/46 site starting from the 100 nM concentration.
Total levels of all these proteins were instead unaffected
by Torin-2.
mTORC2 inhibition had a readout in Ser 473
Akt dephosphorylation and it was observable in all the
cell lines starting from Torin-2 concentration of 50 nM.
Despite some differences, also the Akt downstream
substrate FoxO3A was dephosphorylated in a dose
dependent fashion on its Thr 32 residue in all cell lines
(Fig. 4).

Torin-2 affects the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
B-pre ALL cells
To assess the effects of Torin-2 on the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway, we studied the expression and
activation status of critical components of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR cascade. NALM-6, RS4;11, SEM, TOM-1 and BV173 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
Torin-2 for 2h and Western blot was then performed (Fig.
4).
Torin-2 decreased the phosphorylation levels of

Torin-2 prevents the reactivation of Akt upon
mTOR inhibition in B-pre ALL cells

alone could not achieve the IC50. Thus, RAD001 had a
putative IC50 higher than 5 µM, whereas Torin-2 displayed
an IC50 value < 0.2 μM in all cell lines. Interestingly, we
found that either mTORC1 and mTORC2 substrates,
including Akt, after 48h of Torin-2 treatment remained
dephosphorylated (Fig. 5C). On the contrary, samples
treated with RAD001 already after 24h showed a rephosphorylation of Akt. Direct (FoxO3A) or indirect (S6)
downstream targets of Akt displayed the same behaviour
(Fig. 5C).

Since it has been previously described that in
hematological malignancies [22, 23] and solid tumors [24,
25] with constitutive PI3K/Akt activation, the rapamycin
derivative inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) increased Akt
phosphorylation, we sought to explore if Torin-2 might
prevent Akt re-activation after mTORC1 inhibition.
For this set of experiments we decided to use the
concentration of 0.15 μM, that represents nearly the
average IC50 of Torin-2 in the panel of cell lines employed.
We prolonged the treatment with Torin-2 up to 48h and
we compared it with the mTORC1 inhibitor, RAD001,
employed at the concentration of 0.6 μM. This value has
been chosen to mirror a concentration of a mTORC1
inhibitor (Temsirolimus) correspondent to the plasma
concentration achievable in clinical trials [26]. As shown
in Fig. 5A and B, in a range from 0.05 to 5 μM, RAD001

The allosteric Akt inhibitor MK-2206 synergizes

For therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway, the combined inhibition at different points of the
cascade often leads to more effective results than the use
of a drug that acts on a single or dual targets [27]. To better
assess the potential therapeutic value of Torin-2 in B-pre

ALL, we analyzed its synergistic potential with MK-2206,
an orally active, allosteric Akt inhibitor, which is currently
tested in phase II clinical trials. We also compared this
drug combination with a second one consisting of the
association of MK-2206 and RAD001. The drugs were
used at a fixed ratio (1:1 both for Torin-2/MK-2206 and
RAD001/MK-2206).
After 48h of treatment, MTT assays were performed.
The dual targeting of mTORC1/mTORC2 and Akt with
Torin-2 and MK-2206 did not show a synergistic effect at
any concentration, whereas the administration of RAD001
and MK-2206 together resulted in a relevant synergistic
cytotoxic effect in RS4;11 and BV-173 cell lines (Fig.
6A). This phenomenon was more relevant in the range
between 0.5 and 1 µM, as confirmed by the combination
index (CI) values. Similar results were obtained with other
B-pre ALL cell lines (supplementary Fig. 1). It should be
noted that a comparison between the IC50 values obtained
from the two different treatment at 48h (Torin-2/MK-2206
and RAD001/MK-2206), showed that the IC50 values were
very similar and comparable in each cell line (Fig. 6B).
We next studied the effects of the two drug

combinations on the phosphorylation levels of Akt,
FoxO3A and S6 protein. Torin-2 was used at 0.15 µM,
RAD001 at 0.6 µM and MK-2206 at 0.5 µM for 30
minutes and then Western blot analysis was performed.
The concentration of MK-2206 was selected for
either being in the range of maximal synergy and to
be comparable to the plasma concentration that has
been obtained in clinical trials in acute myelogenous
leukemia [28]. Both SEM and SUP-B15 cell lines did
not show a synergistic effect of Torin-2 and MK-2206
on the phosphorylation levels of Akt, FoxO3A and S6.
Interestingly, there was an additional downregulation of
protein phosphorylation only when the dual treatment
RAD001/MK-2206 was administered, thus confirming
the synergistic effect in modulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway (Fig. 6C). To further assess these findings, we
explored the effects of dual treatments on cell cycle, by
flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained samples in RS4;11
and BV-173 cells cultured for 24h. Both drug associations
yielded comparable results. The treatment with Torin-2
and MK-2206 was similar to the single administration
of Torin-2 alone. At variance, the dual administration of

RAD001 and MK-2206 increased the percentage of cells
in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in comparison with
single drug administration (Fig. 7A).
We also examined the pro-apoptotic effect of the
two drug association on NALM-6 and TOM-1 cells. Cells
were treated with 0.15 µM Torin-2 or 0.6 µM RAD001
and 0.5 µM MK-2206 for 24h and then analyzed by
MTT assays. Using these drug concentrations, nearly
20% of apoptotic cells were observed in either cell
line with both drug combinations. However, apoptosis
induced by the treatment with Torin-2 and MK-2206 was
comparable with that observable with the administration
of Torin-2 alone, whereas the apoptosis obtained with the
dual administration of RAD001 and MK-2206 was the
consequence of a synergistic effect (Fig. 7B).
Finally, the effect of Bafilomycin A1 on dual
targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway with a

combination of Torin-2/MK-2206 or RAD001/MK2206 was analyzed. A consistent inhibition of autophagy
increased the viability of B-pre ALL cells treated with
Torin-2/MK-2206 (Fig. 7C, left panel) and to a lower
extent with RAD001/MK-2206 (Fig. 7C, right panel). This
difference may rely on the different mechanism through
which autophagy is recruited by the drugs: those who act
on mTOR, activated autophagy as a cell death mechanism
[16],whereas the drug that inhibit Akt, induced autophagy
as a cell protection mechanism [29].

(DSBs) trigger recruitment of ATM and ATR to the
damage site which in turn phosphorylates histone H2AX
leading to foci formation [30].
Torin-2 also exhibited potent biochemical and
cellular activity against PIKK family kinases including
ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, whose inhibition sensitized
cells to irradiation [15]. The ATR pathway is known to
transmit DNA damage signals through the ATR-CHK1
kinase cascade and activation of cell cycle checkpoint
regulators such as CHK1 and CHK2 has a critical role in
promoting cell cycle arrest in response to cytotoxic agents,
including doxorubicin [31].
We tested if the combination of Doxorubicin and
Torin-2 may exert additional cytotoxic activity than
the two drugs administered alone. In Figure 8A are
shown the results of MTT assays of two representative
cell lines (SEM and TOM-1) analyzed for cell viability
after treatment with the drugs used either as single
agents or combined together. In both cell lines, the drug
combination induced a stronger decrease in cell viability
(Fig. 8A). Doxorubicin alone induced phosphorylation of
CHK1 (Ser 345, a marker for ATR activity) and CHK2
(Thr 68, a readout for ATM activity). In contrast, Torin-2
(0.25 µM) alone did not increase CHK1 and CHK2

phosphorylation, whereas it dramatically decreased the
phosphorylation induced by Doxorubicin (Fig. 8B). One
prominent chromatin modification in response to DNA
damage is phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser 139,
which is referred to as γ-H2AX [32].
Torin-2 inhibited the DNA damage response induced
by Doxorubicin, as documented by the effects on the
levels of phosphorylated γ-H2AX on the Ser 139 residue
(Fig. 8B).

DISCUSSION
Owing to the fundamental role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway in tumor development and progression, there
has been a significant interest in developing inhibitors
against components of this pathway, up to having now
many compounds currently under evaluation in clinical
trials. ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors represent
a promising new approach to target the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway with potentially greater tolerability than dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors [5, 33, 34]. It has been previously
reported that first generation mTOR kinase inhibitors had
improved efficacy compared to rapamycin in models of

Ph+ B-ALL [35].
We have recently explored the therapeutic potential
of RAD001, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor in preclinical models of B-pre ALL [16]. We documented that
RAD001 decreased cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest
in G0/G1 phase and caused apoptosis in B-pre ALL cell
lines. Autophagy was also induced, which was important
for the RAD001 cytotoxic effect, as downregulation of
Beclin-1 reduced drug cytotoxicity. RAD001, used in
the micromolar range and administered 24h before MK2206 showed the capacity to synergize with MK-2206
in both cell lines and patient samples [16]. In this study,
we evaluated for the first time the efficacy of the novel
mTORC1/mTORC2 second generation, ATP-competitive
inhibitor, Torin-2 [14] in pre-clinical settings of Ph+ and
Ph- B-pre ALL.
Torin-2 was both cytotoxic and cytostatic in a
nanomolar range to B-pre ALL cell lines in a concentration
dependent mechanism, as demonstrated by MTT assays,
flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-stained samples
and of PI-stained samples. Apoptosis resulted to play
a determinat role in the killing mechanism, since the
treatment with a pan caspase inhibitor protected the
cells from Torin-2 cytotoxic effect. These results are in
agreement with those observed with other drugs in acute
myeloid leukemia [36, 37].
Torin-2 also induced autophagy, as documented
by increased expression of the lipidated form of LC3.
In order to demonstrate whether autophagy was either
a survival or a death mechanism, B-pre ALL were cotreated with the autophagic sequestration inhibitors, 3-MA
and Bafilomycin A1. We found that either treatment with
3-MA and Bafilomycin A1, resulted in a lower sensitivity
of both SEM and BV-173 cells to the cytotoxic effects of
RAD001 and indicated that Torin-2-induced autophagy
was very important for the cytotoxic effects of the drug.
The phosphorylation status of the key elements of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, assessed by Western blot,
was equally sensitive to Torin-2 inhibition in either cells
harboring or not the Bcr-Abl fusion protein.
RAD001, when used in the nanomolar range
against this panel of cell lines, was much less cytotoxic
than Torin-2, as it displayed IC50s > 5 µM. This superior
efficacy of the second generation inhibitors, has been
also reported for MLN0128, another mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibitor, which displayed an improved anti-leukemic
activity when compared to first generation inhibitors,
in Ph- B-ALL derived from both adult and pediatric
subjects [21]. It has been reported that in solid tumor
models, activation of mTORC1 drives p70S6K-mediated
degradation of the IR/IGF-1R adaptor protein IRS-1, and
is therefore a negative regulator of PI3K [38]. Accordingly,
drugs targeting mTORC1 block this feedback and trigger
reactivation of the pathway and re-phosphorylation of
Akt on Ser 473 residue in acute myelogenous leukemia
cells [22, 39]. The issue of Akt reactivation in response to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTORC1 inhibition, has not been throughly investigated
in B-pre ALL. It is worth highlighting that Torin-2
maintained a prolonged suppression of mTORC1/
mTORC2 with a sustained anti-proliferative effect,
overcoming the limitations of rapalogs such as RAD001,
as demonstrated by our findings, which resulted in re/
hyper-phosphorylation of Akt and could hamper their
anti-tumor action and enhance resistance to antineoplastic
therapy, thus resulting in a poor outcome [40].
Akt activity is directly downregulated on Thr 308
by the protein phosphatase PP2A [41], which is also
critically involved in regulation of cell cycle progression
[42] and DNA damage response [43]. Accumulating
evidence indicates that PP2A acts as a tumor suppressor
and impairment of PP2A activity may result in loss of this
function [7]. The capacity of Torin-2, but not of RAD001,
to inhibit both mTORC1 and 2 may represent a possible
mechanism for why Akt is not re-phosphorylated with this
drug on the Ser 473 residue and this phosphorylation may
be independent form PP2A activity.
The Torin-2 prolonged suppression of Akt
phosphorylation may overcome the occurrence of PP2A
oncosuppressor altered function and may render Akt
inhibition independent from the activity of PP2A, thus
proposing this therapeutic options as a potential tool that
could act functionally on either impaired Akt and PP2A
functions.
Overall, Torin-2 alone was as potent as a
combination consisting of RAD001 and MK-2206, in
terms of reduction of cell viability, apoptosis induction,
and cell cycle block. In contrast, when MK-2206 was
combined with Torin-2, it did not display any synergistic
effect. Interestingly, the presence of synergism or its lack
was evident also when the phosphorylation status of key
elements of the pathway was analyzed by Western blot.
Both ATM and ATR play a central role in
coordinating the DNA damage response, including
cell cycle checkpoint control and apoptosis [44]. Since
the results by Liu et al. [15], using purified enzymes,
suggested that Torin-2 was also an inhibitor of several
PIKK family members including ATR, ATM, and DNAPK, we investigated if this was also true in B-pre ALL
cell lines. Western blot analysis documented that indeed
Torin-2 inhibited ATM and ATR in intact cells and, by
inhibiting DNA repair, potentiated the cytotoxic effect of
Doxorubicin. Torin-2 displayed an obvious advantage over
RAD001, which also induced a similar phenomenon, as
Torin-2 could be used in the nanomolar range, whereas
RAD001 required a concentration as high as 16 µM [45],
which could not be attained in vivo. In addition, very
recently it has been reported that Akt inhibition with
CCT12893 increased the phosphorylation of CHK1/CHK2
and γ-H2AX [46].
These findings open a new very interesting field to
be further explored in the future regarding the therapeutic
effect of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors involving DNA
10043

damage sensors and cell cycle checkpoints such as CHK1
and CHK2.
In conclusion, our data indicate that the novel
mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor Torin-2 can
suppress the growth of both Ph+ and Ph- B-pre ALL
cells and extend the finding that the antiproliferative
and proapoptotic effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
inhibitors are independent from ABL-translocation, as
reported in long-term cultures of Ph+ and Ph- B-precursor
ALL cells from patients [40]. Remarkably, Torin-2,
even after a 48h incubation, blocked the reactivation of
Akt, thus confirming the new therapeutic hopes that this
second generation of inhibitors is developing. In addition,
Torin-2 could be also effective in combination with
chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents, in light of its
capacity of blocking DNA repair.
Interestingly, with the aim of improving B-pre
ALL treatment, we also came to the conclusion that low
concentrations of RAD001 and MK-2206 (which can
be attained in vivo) may achieve a therapeutic efficacy
comparable to an mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor. These
therapeutic strategies could be particularly effective when
combined with targeted next generation sequencing of
tumor samples, since genomic alterations can be detected
and help to identify refractory patients with aberrations
putatively activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [47,
48]. These pharmacological options targeting PI3K/Akt/
mTOR at different points of the signaling pathway cascade
or in combination with conventional chemotherapy might
represent a new therapeutic potential for treatment of
B-pre ALL patients.

Cell culture and Western blot analysis
All the B-pre acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell
lines were obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig,
Germany). SEM, REH, BV-173 and NALM6 were grown
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS); RS4;11 cells were
grown in Alpha-MEM medium with 10% FBS; TOM-1
cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% FBS
and SUP-B15 cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium
with 20% FBS. All the media were supplemented with
100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The
cells were grown at a density of 0.5 to 2 x 106 cells/ml
and were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. Western blot
analysis was performed by standard methods as described
elsewhere [49].

Cell viability analysis
MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthythiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were performed as
previously described [50].

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed using the MuseTM
Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy) and/or
propidium iodide (PI)/RNase A staining by flow cytometry
according to standard techniques, as described elsewhere
[51]. In brief, after 24h of drug treatment, cells were
harvested, centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min and washed
once with 1X PBS. After fixing them with 70% ethanol
at 20°C, cells were centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min and
washed once with 1X PBS. Then 200 μl of MuseTM Cell
Cycle reagent or 100 μl of propidium iodide (PI)/RNase A
staining was added to each tube with an incubation of 30
min at room temperature in the dark. Samples were then
analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The combination effect and the potential synergy
of Torin-2 and RAD001 with MK-2206 were evaluated
from quantitative analysis of dose–effect relationship,
as described previously [16]. For each Torin-2/MK2206 or RAD001/MK-2206 combination experiment, a
combination index (CI) number was calculated using the
Biosoft CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
This method of analysis generally defines CI values from
0.9 to 1.1 as additive, from 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic and
0.3 as strongly synergistic, whereas values over 1.1 are
considered as antagonistic.
