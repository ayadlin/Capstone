BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has suggested that the capability to sustain tumor formation, growth, and chemotherapy resistance in ovarian as well as other human malignancies exclusively resides in a small proportion of tumor
cells termed cancer stem cells. During the characterization of CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells, we found a high
expression of the genes encoding for claudin-4. Because this tight junction protein is the natural high-affinity receptor for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), we have extensively investigated the sensitivity of ovarian cancer
stem cells to CPE treatment in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry
were used to evaluate claudin-3/-4 expression in ovarian cancer stem cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown experiments and MTS assays were used to evaluate CPE-induced cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer stem cell lines in vitro.
C.B-17/SCID mice harboring ovarian cancer stem cell xenografts were used to evaluate CPE therapeutic activity in
vivo. RESULTS: CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells expressed claudin-4 gene at significantly higher levels than matched
autologous CD44 ovarian cancer cells, and regardless of their higher resistance to chemotherapeutic agents died
within 1 hour after exposure to 1.0 lg/mL of CPE in vitro. Conversely, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of
claudin-3/-4 expression in CD44þ cancer stem cells significantly protected cancer stem cells from CPE-induced cytotoxicity. Importantly, multiple intraperitoneal administrations of sublethal doses of CPE in mice harboring xenografts
of chemotherapy-resistant CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor progression
leading to the cure and/or long-term survival of all treated animals (ie, 100% reduction in tumor burden in 50% of
treated mice; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: CPE may represent an unconventional, potentially highly effective strategy

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) remains the cancer with the highest mortality rate among gynecological
tumors.1 At the time of diagnosis, 2=3 of patients have advanced disease, and unfortunately, after their initial response to
the combination of surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, the majority of ovarian cancer patients develop recurrence
and inevitably die from the development of chemotherapy-resistant disease.2 Thus, the identification of novel therapeutic
strategies against chemotherapy-resistant/recurrent ovarian cancer remains a high priority.
Emerging evidence has recently been provided to suggest that the capability to sustain tumor formation, growth, and
chemotherapy-resistance in ovarian as well as other human malignancies exclusively resides in a small proportion of tumor
cells termed cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells.3-6 The stem cell-like phenotype of tumor-initiating cells and their
limited number within the bulk of the tumor may lead to disease relapse, although the primary lesion is eradicated by conventional therapies; hence, the identification and characterization of tumor stem cells remains of paramount importance

for the development of therapeutic strategies capable of
affecting the survival of tumor-initiating as well as nontumorigenic cells.
In an attempt to unravel the mechanisms for repair
and chemotherapy resistance of these highly lethal gynecologic tumors, several research groups have recently
described the identification and characterization of the molecular phenotype of human ovarian cancer stem cells.7-10
In a large number of studies, CD44 has been extensively
reported as a marker that can enrich for cancer stem cells
in multiple solid tumors, and its specific correlation with
ovarian cancer stem cells has been consistently established.7-10 Accordingly, in this study, cancer stem cells were
isolated from ascites and solid tumors of multiple ovarian
cancer patients and characterized as CD44þ/MyD88þ cells
showing constitutive nuclear factor j B (NF-KB) activity,
cytokine and chemokine production, high capacity for
repair, resistance to conventional chemotherapies, resistance
to tumor necrosis factor a-mediated apoptosis, capacity to
form spheroids in suspension, and more importantly, ability to recapitulate in vivo the original tumor.
Of great interest, we found CD44þ ovarian cancer
stem cells to express high levels of the gene encoding the
tight junction protein claudin-4. Because this protein has
been shown to represent the high-affinity natural receptor
for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), and is capable of mediating CPE binding and cytolysis,11,12 in this
study, we have: 1) carefully analyzed and quantified by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) and flow cytometry the expression levels of claudin3/-4 receptors in CD44þ cancer stem cell populations
derived from multiple freshly explanted ovarian tumors,
2) tested the ability of CPE to kill chemotherapy-resistant
ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells overexpressing claudin4 in vitro, 3) investigated in functional assays the effects of

claudin-3/-4 receptors knockdown on CPE-induced
CD44þ cancer stem cell toxicity in vitro, and 4) studied
the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of intraperitoneal (i.p.)
CPE therapy in SCID mice harboring xenografts of highly
relevant clinical models of chemotherapy-resistant freshly
explanted ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells. We report
for the first time that ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells
overexpress the high-affinity claudin-4 CPE receptor and
that these chemotherapy-resistant cells are highly sensitive
to CPE treatment in vitro. More importantly, we report
that in vivo therapy with repeated i.p. injections of welltolerated doses of CPE induces the cure or long-term survival of animals harboring established chemotherapy-resistant ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell-initiated tumors.
CPE-mediated therapy may thus represent a novel, potentially highly effective strategy for the eradication of ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells resistant to chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CPE Production
CPE production and purification was performed as previously described.13 Purified, endotoxin-free CPE protein
was sterilized by 0.2 lm filtration and frozen in aliquots at
70 C before its use in in vitro and in vivo studies.
Ovarian Cancer Stem Cell Lines and
Culture Conditions
Primary cultures of human ovarian cancer cells were
obtained from ascites or tumor tissue at the time of primary or secondary (ie, recurrence) tumor debulking and
used to isolate and culture CD44þ cancer stem cells as
previously described.9,10,14 Characteristics of patients
from whom CD44þ cancer stem cells were obtained are
described in Table 1. Briefly, CD44þ cancer stem cells

were isolated using a 2-step process: 1) staining with antiCD44 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (eBioscience,
San Diego, Calif) and 2) isolation using anti-FITC
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), according to manufacturers’ instructions. For the
in vitro and in vivo studies described below, we used a
panel of freshly isolated CD44þ cancer stem cell lines
derived from ovarian cancer patients harboring advanced
stage tumors (ie, stage III-IV) with serous papillary and
clear cell histology (Table 1), as well as clones of previously characterized CD44þ/NF-KB-high/MyD88þ ovarian cancer stem cells.9,10 The use of patients’ samples was
approved by Yale University’s Human Investigations
Committee. Control cell lines evaluated in our experiments included matched autologous CD44 ovarian cancer cells (ie, obtained from the same tumor from which
CD44þ cancer stem lines were isolated), Vero cells, normal ovarian epithelium, normal cervical keratinocytes,
Epstein-Barr–transformed B lymphocytes, and human
fibroblasts. Only primary cancer stem cell cultures that
had at least 90% viability and contained >95% CD44þ
cells after sorting were used for the in vitro and in vivo
experiments.
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR
RNA isolation from primary freshly isolated CD44þ cancer stem cell lines, cancer stem cell clones, and control
cells was performed using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions as previously described.13 qRT-PCR was performed with a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif), using the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol, to evaluate expression of claudin3/-4 in all samples. The primers for claudin-3/-4 were
obtained from Applied Biosystems as Assay-on-Demand
products. Assays ID were Hs00265816_s1 (claudin-3)
and Hs00433616_s1 (claudin-4). The comparative
threshold cycle method (PE Applied Biosystems) was
used to determine gene expression in each sample relative
to the value observed in the nonmalignant ovarian epithelial cells, using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Assay-on-Demand Hs99999905_m1) mRNA as
internal control.
Flow Cytometry Experiments
We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to
confirm high surface expression of the CPE receptors on
primary freshly isolated CD44þ cancer stem cell lines and
control cells using a FITC-labeled Clostridium perfringens

carboxy-terminal fragment peptide (CPE290-319). The
FITC-CPE290-319 peptide was synthesized by Invitrogen,
with the sequence FITC-SLDAGQYVLVMKANSSYSGNYPYSILFQKF and a purity level >95%. Control cells
included CD44 ovarian cancer cells obtained from the
same patients from whom CD44þ cancer stem cell lines
were isolated and normal cells (ie, peripheral blood lymphocytes, Epstein-Barr–transformed B lymphocytes, and
human fibroblasts), which show low and/or negligible
claudin-3/-4 receptor expression. Vero cells, expressing
high levels of claudin-3/-4 receptors, were used as positive
controls in all assays. Briefly, approximately 2.5  105
cells were resuspended with 50 lL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1% bovine serum albumin that contained 2 lg
of FITC-labeled CPE peptide. Cells were then incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells stained with FITClabeled CPE peptide were then washed with PBS, resuspended in 500 lL PBS, and immediately analyzed by
FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif).
Chemotherapy Resistance MTS Assay In Vitro
Freshly isolated CD44þ cancer stem cell lines and control
cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at a dose of
2500 cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 hours.
Media were removed after 24 hours and replaced with
100 lL of culture medium or the same volume of medium
containing various concentrations of carboplatin or paclitaxel (ie, from 1 lM to 1000 lM and from 1 nM to
20,000 nM, respectively). After 72-hour incubation, 20
lL of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent containing a tetrazolium compound (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H
tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) (Promega Corporation,
Madison, Wis) was added, and incubated, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured by a 96-well VERSA max plate-reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) at a reference wavelength of
490 nm. Each drug concentration was obtained in
3 replicate wells, and each experiment was performed in
parallel a minimum of 3 using cell lines established
from surgical biopsies.

1  105 cells/well into 6-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, Mass) with the appropriate medium for 24 hours.
After washing and renewal of the medium, CPE was
added to final concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1.0
lg/mL. After incubation for 60 minutes to 24 hours at
37 C, 5% CO2, floating cells were removed and stored,
and attached cells were trypsinized and pooled with the
floating cells. After staining with trypan blue, viability was
determined by counting the number of trypan blue-positive cells and the total cell number.
Small Interfering RNA Knockdown
Experiments
Claudin-3/-4 specific small interfering (siRNA) oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin,
Tex). Briefly, freshly isolated CD44þ ovarian cancer stem
cell lines cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with
siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Twelve
nanomolars of each specific siRNA were incubated with 5
lL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. Mock transfections and
nonspecific siRNA duplexes were used as negative controls. CD44þ cancer stem cells were treated for 72 hours
(ie, the time we found required for maximal down-regulation of claudin-3/-4, based on qRT-PCR), after which
they were either collected for RNA extraction and qRTPCR experiments, as described above, or exposed to different concentrations of CPE in MTS cytotoxicity assays.
Briefly, CD44þ cancer stem cells were detached, washed,
and seeded in 96-well culture plates at optimum density
and allowed to attach for 3 hours in 80 lL of culture medium. Twenty microliters of medium containing recombinant CPE was then added to reach a final concentration of
0.5 lg/mL or 1 lg/mL of the toxin. After 1 hour of CPE
incubation, 20 lL of CellTiter 96 AQueous 1 Solution Reagent MTS was added to the wells, and CD44þ cancer
stem cells were incubated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for an additional 1 hour before absorbance was
measured by a 96-well VERSA max plate-reader (Molecular Devices) at a reference wavelength of 490 nm. Each
CPE concentration was obtained in 3 replicate wells, and
each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3.
In Vivo CPE Treatment of SCID Mouse CD441
Ovarian Cancer Stem Cell Tumor Xenografts
C.B-17/SCID female mice 5 to 7 weeks old were obtained
from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, Ind) and
used to generate ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell tumor
xenografts. The Yale University Institutional Animal Care

5522

and Use Committee approved all in vivo studies
described. Briefly, the ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell
line was injected i.p. at a dose of 5  106 into C.B-17/
SCID mice in groups of 5. One week after i.p. tumor
injection, mice were injected i.p. with 7.5 lg of CPE dissolved in 1 mL of sterile saline at 72- to 96-hour intervals
for a total of 8 injections, whereas control animals were
injected with sterile saline. All animals were observed
twice daily and weighed weekly, and survival was monitored. In addition, groups of 3 mice injected i.p. at a dose
of 5  106 ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells were killed at
1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks for necropsy and pathologic analysis.
The remaining animals were killed and examined just
before they died of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis and
malignant ascites.
Statistics
Statistical differences in siRNA knockdown experiments
of MTS cytotoxicity, trypan blue cytotoxicity, and in
claudin-3/-4 expression between isolated CD44þ ovarian
cancer stem cell lines, cancer stem cell clones, CD44
matched autologous ovarian cancer cells, and normal control cells were tested using Student t test. For the response
to chemotherapy, the concentration that inhibits 50%
(IC50) for a given drug was determined from the doseresponse curve fit to the cell count data using the XLFit
program (ID Business Solutions, Parsippany, NJ). The
Lavenburg-Marquardt algorithm was used to obtain and
calculate the IC50 and IC50 curves for each drug in each
cell line using a nonlinear regression curve fit. To facilitate
statistical inference on IC50 fold changes, IC50s were
transformed to log10 units. Differences in log10(IC50)s
between CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cell lines and cancer
stem cell clones versus matched CD44 autologous ovarian cancer cells were assessed for significance via unequalvariance t test. For the ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell
animal model, survival was plotted using Kaplan-Meier
methods and compared using the log-rank test. A P value
<.05 was used for statistical significance.

tissues and/or ascites. Table 1 describes patient characteristics and the different percentages of CD44þ cancer stem
cells found in the ovarian cancer specimens tested. Both
claudin-3 and claudin-4 genes were found to be significantly overexpressed in primary ovarian carcinomas when
compared with normal ovarian epithelium control cells.
Claudin-3 had a mean  standard error (SE) copy number of 1094  371 in the tumor samples, compared with
3  1 in the normal ovarian epithelium (P ¼ .002). Claudin-4 had a mean  SE copy number of 143  29 in the
tumor samples, compared with 6  3 in the normal ovarian epithelium (P ¼ .0001). Similarly, claudin-3/-4 expression was low in all other control tissues examined,

including normal endometrial epithelium, normal cervical
keratinocytes, and normal human fibroblasts (data not
shown). Of great interest, as shown in Figure 1 (Top), we
found CD44þ cancer stem cell populations and CD44þ
cancer stem cell clones to express significantly higher levels
of the claudin-4 receptor when compared with the matched
CD44 ovarian tumor specimens (P ¼ .001). In contrast,
claudin-3 was not found to be significantly overexpressed
in the CD44þ cancer stem cell populations and CD44þ
clones when compared with matched CD44 autologous
tumor cells (P ¼ .5, Fig. 1, Top).
CPE Surface Receptor Expression by Flow
Cytometry in Isolated CD441 Cancer Stem
Cells
To determine whether the high expression of the claudin4 gene detected by qRT-PCR in primary ovarian CD44þ
cancer stem cells also resulted in high expression of the
protein on the surface of cancer stem cells, we evaluated
the ability of the FITC-conjugated CPE peptide to label
freshly isolated CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cell cultures
in flow cytometry experiments. As representatively demonstrated in Figure 1 (Middle) for a primary ovarian
CD44þ cancer stem cell and 1 cancer stem cell clone,
FITC-conjugated CPE peptide was found to be highly reactive against all primary CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cell
lines tested, with positivity in 100% of tumor cells and a
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI  standard deviation

The Y axis represents the fold induction relative to normal

was assessed by MTS assay as described in the Materials and

[SD]) of 60  15. These values of MFI were not significantly different from those found by testing CPE receptor
expression on Vero cells (ie, positive controls, data not
shown). Consistent with qRT-PCR results, negligible or
no binding was detected by flow-cytometry against
normal ovarian cell controls expressing low levels of claudin-3 and/or claudin-4 (ie, normal ovarian epithelium,
Epstein-Barr–transformed B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts, data not shown).
CD441 Cancer Stem Cells Are More Resistant
to Chemotherapy When Compared With
CD442 Matched Autologous Tumor Cells by
MTS Chemoresponse Assay
We next compared the effects of carboplatin and paclitaxel single-agent chemotherapy (ie, the gold standard
chemotherapy agents used in the clinic in ovarian cancer
patients) against multiple primary CD44þ ovarian cancer
stem cell lines, cancer stem cell clones, and matched
CD44 ovarian cancer control cells by MTS assays. Consistent with previously reported results,9,10 we found primary CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells to be consistently
and significantly more resistant to carboplatin and paclitaxel when compared with CD44 matched cancer cells
in multiple experiments (P ¼ .01). Results are displayed
as the average  SD from 3 independent experiments. As
representatively shown in Figure 1 (Bottom) for a CD44þ
ovarian cancer stem cell population and a CD44þ ovarian
cancer stem cell clone, a higher IC50 (ie, higher resistance)
to carboplatin and paclitaxel was consistently detected in
the CD44þ cancer stem cell populations when compared
with their matched CD44 ovarian cancer control cell
cultures (Fig. 1, Bottom; P ¼ .01).
Effects of CPE on Primary CD441 Ovarian
Cancer Stem Cells
On the basis of the high expression of claudin-4 found at
mRNA and protein level on primary CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cell lines, it was expected that ovarian CD44þ
cancer stem cells expressing claudin-4 would be sensitive
to CPE-mediated lysis. However, it was important to
demonstrate this directly on freshly isolated human
CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells, and cancer stem cell
clones were showed to be highly resistant to chemotherapy. Accordingly, the sensitivity of primary ovarian
CD44þ cancer stem cell cultures to CPE-mediated cytolysis was tested along with an appropriate claudin-3 and
claudin-4–expressing positive control (ie, Vero cells) and
negative controls that do not express detectable levels of

5524

either claudin-3 or claudin-4. As shown in Figure 2,
regardless of their high resistance to chemotherapy, all
ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell populations tested (ie, a
total of 8 different ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell lines)
were found to be highly sensitive to CPE-mediated cytolysis (P ¼ .001). The cytotoxic effect was dose dependent
and was positively correlated to the levels of CPE-receptor
expression as tested by qRT-PCR in tumor samples.
Importantly, no ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell population was found viable after 24 hours of exposure to CPE
at the concentration of 1.0 lg/mL (Fig. 2). In contrast, all
normal controls tested, including ovarian epithelium, cervical keratinocytes, human fibroblasts, and human lymphocytes, lacking or expressing negligible levels of
claudin-3/-4, were not affected by CPE exposure (Fig. 2).
Knockdown of Claudin-3 and Claudin-4
Expression in CD441 Ovarian Cancer Stem
Cells Confers Resistance to CPE-Mediated
Cytotoxicity
To experimentally demonstrate that expression of claudin-3/-4 is required for the biological effects of CPE
against ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells in functional
assays, we used siRNA to knock down claudin-3/-4
expression in multiple ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell
populations before their exposure to lethal doses of CPE.
Transient siRNA transfections were carried using claudin3 and claudin-4–specific siRNA duplexes, and silencing
efficiency was evaluated by qRT-PCR at different time
points. As representatively shown in Figure 3 (Top) for
the ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell line, transfection
with claudin-specific siRNA duplexes efficiently repressed
the expression of claudin-3 and claudin-4 by 90.4% 
6.1% (mean  SD) and 72.5%  9.1% (mean  SD),
respectively, at 72 hours, whereas expression remained
unchanged in mock or control siRNA-treated cells (data
not shown). Importantly, as shown in Figure 3 (Bottom)
for a representative ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cell population, down-regulation of claudin-3/-4 expression was
able to significantly increase CD44þ cancer stem cell resistance to CPE exposure when compared with untreated
or mock transfected control cells (P < .004).

tumor was selected as a source of ovarian CD44þ cancer
stem cells because of its high resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents in vivo and in vitro (as tested in chemosensitivity MTS assay, Fig. 1 (Bottom), and extreme drug
resistance assay by Oncotech Inc., Irvine, Calif; data not
shown) as well as its high content of CD44þ /NF-KBhigh/MyD88þ cancer stem cells (ie, 22.6%, Table 1). Primary ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells grew progressively
as numerous serosal nodules adherent to virtually all
intra-abdominal organs and exhibited the capacity for
local tissue invasion and formation of malignant ascites 2
to 3 weeks from injection. Necropsies revealed massive
hemorrhagic ascites and numerous tumor nodules, measuring 1 to 8 mm in diameter, studding the entire peritoneal surface and implanting the serosa of virtually all
intra-abdominal organs. Our previous toxicology studies
in mice have reported 0.5 lg/g of CPE administered i.p.
to be a well-tolerated and safe dose in 100% of the animals
(ie, 16.5  1.0 g female mice).13 Accordingly, in the in
vivo experiments, groups of mice harboring established
ovarian tumor burden xenografts (ie, 1 week after ovarian
CD44þ cancer stem cell injection) were treated with
repeated i.p. CPE injections (ie, 7.5 lg of CPE in 500 lL
of sterile saline) every 72 to 96 hours for a total of 8

administrations. Control mice harboring ovarian CD44þ
cancer stem cells received saline alone. CPE injections
were well tolerated, and no adverse events were observed
throughout the complete treatment protocol either in
control mice receiving CPE alone or in CPE-treated mice
harboring tumor burden. Mice harboring ovarian
CD44þ cancer stem cells treated with saline all died
within 10 weeks from tumor injection, with a mean survival of 54 days (Fig. 4). In contrast, animals treated with
multiple i.p. CPE injections survived significantly longer
than control animals (P < .0001, Fig. 4). Importantly,
4 of 8 (50%) of the mice treated with i.p. injections of
CPE remained alive and free of detectable tumor for
the entire duration of the study period (ie, over 150 days,
P < .0001).

DISCUSSION
Multiple human cancers including, but not limited to,
leukemia, brain, breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic
tumors have recently been reported to contain stem-like
cancer cells called cancer stem cells.4-6 Although it is still
open to question whether tumors derive from organ stem
cells that retain self-renewal properties but acquire
epigenetic and genetic changes required for tumorigenicity

Figure 4. Survival of C.B-17/SCID mice after intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of 5  106 viable ovarian CD44þ cancer stem
cells is shown. Animals harboring ovarian CD44þ cancer stem
cell tumors established for 1 week were injected i.p. with 7.5
lg of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) as described
in the Material and Methods section for a total of 8 72 to 96
hours apart. Mice were evaluated on a daily basis and sacrificed when showing significant sign of disease and/or disease-induced distress as per Yale Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee regulations. The log-rank test yielded P
< .0001 for the differences in survival.

or whether tumor stem cells are proliferative progenitors
that acquire self-renewal capacity, the identification of molecules differentially or uniquely expressed in human cancer
stem cells may provide novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic
markers critical for the elimination of this fraction of cancer
cells, which is highly resistant to chemotherapy and therefore likely responsible for the recurrence and death of the
majority of patients diagnosed with cancer.
Consistent with this hypothesis, several groups have
reported the identification and molecular characterization

5526

of ovarian cancer stem cells.7-10,15-18 Multiple putative
ovarian cancer stem cell markers including but not limited
to CD133 and ALDH1 have recently been identified15-18;
in the present study, ovarian cancer stem cells were identified and enriched as CD44þ cells present in primary, metastatic, and recurrent ovarian tumors, as well as in malignant
ascites.7-10,19 Ovarian cancer stem cells are characterized by
a unique genetic profile8-10 and microRNA signatures19
that confer the distinctive characteristics of cancer
stem cells in terms of their tumorigenicity, resistance to
chemotherapy, differentiation potential both in vitro
and in vivo, and capacity to promote a proinflammatory
microenvironment.7-10,19
During the cloning and further characterization of
the molecular phenotype of CD44þ/NF-KB-high/
MyD88þ ovarian cancer stem cells, we found a high
expression of the gene encoding for claudin-4. This tight
junction protein is the natural high affinity human receptor for the cytotoxic effect of CPE, a single polypeptide of
35 kd comprised of 319 amino acids that is associated
with C. perfringens type A food poisoning.11,12 Because
CPE is able to trigger the lysis of claudin-4–positive epithelial cells by initiating massive permeability changes, osmotic cell ballooning, and lysis within several
minutes,11,12,20-22 whereas mammalian cells that do not

express the high-affinity CPE receptor (ie, the majority of
normal tissues in the body) fail to bind CPE and are not
susceptible to CPE cytotoxicity,11-13,20,21 to target ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells based on their high levels of
claudin-4 is potentially a novel, unconventional, and
highly effective therapeutic approach to eradicate chemotherapy-resistant/residual ovarian disease.
In this study, we have extensively investigated the
expression of claudin-3/-4 in CD44þ ovarian cancer stem
cells and tested their sensitivity to CPE treatment in vitro
and in vivo. Our results demonstrate for the first time a
high expression of the high-affinity CPE receptor (claudin-4) at both RNA and protein levels in multiple
primary CD44þ/NF-KB-high/MyD88þ ovarian cancer
stem cell populations. These results are consistent with
previous reports from our own group demonstrating a
high expression of the CPE receptors in multiple primary
ovarian cancer cell lines characterized by a high resistance
to chemotherapy,13 as well as the study evaluating the proteomes of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells by Stewart et al, who also found claudin-4 as 1 of the top
differentially expressed proteins in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumors.23 Importantly, all CD44þ /NF-KB-high/
MyD88þ ovarian cancer stem cell populations evaluated,
regardless of their higher resistance to chemotherapy
when compared with autologous CD44 matched ovarian cancer cells, were found to be sensitive to CPE-mediated killing in vitro. This was in strong contrast with the
lack of sensitivity of normal ovarian epithelium as well as
other normal control cells to CPE-mediated cytolysis.
These findings are likely explained by a limited expression
of claudin-4 in normal epithelia compared with chemotherapy-resistant CD44þ cancer stem cells. Accordingly,
an increased resistance to CPE was consistently noted in
all CD44þ cancer stem cell populations tested after transfection with siRNA to knock down claudin-3/-4 expression. These data suggest that claudin-3/-4 are indeed
required for mediating the biological effects of CPE on
CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells.
Importantly, pharmacologic studies in ovarian cancer patients have demonstrated a marked therapeutic
advantage to the intraperitoneal delivery of drugs and biological agents combined with a significant reduction in
systemic toxicity resulting from i.p. drug administration
when compared with an identical dose of the drug given
intravenously.24 These clinical observations, combined
with the finding that ovarian cancer remains confined to
the peritoneal cavity for much of its natural history, suggest that i.p. administration of CPE in human patients

Cancer

harboring chemotherapy-resistant/residual disease (ie, a
population of tumor cells potentially enriched in CD44þ
cancer stem cells) may result in reduced toxicity and better
therapeutic responses compared with an identical dose of
CPE given intravenously. Accordingly, we have also conducted a careful evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of
i.p. injections of CPE in vivo in a clinically relevant animal model of CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cells derived
from the biopsy of a patient harboring recurrent chemotherapy-resistant ovarian carcinoma and confirmed to be
highly resistant in vitro by multiple chemoassays. We
found that multiple i.p. injections of sublethal doses of
CPE in vivo were well tolerated, and no adverse events
were observed throughout the complete treatment protocol either in control mice receiving CPE alone or CPEtreated mice harboring CD44þ ovarian cancer stem cell
xenografts. Thus, these data demonstrate that CPE doses
found effective in vitro to kill ovarian CD44þ cancer stem
cells may be safely administered i.p. in mice harboring
ovarian cancer disease. More importantly, we found that
survival of mice harboring an established burden of chemotherapy-resistant ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells was
significantly prolonged in all treated animals, with 50%
of mice remaining alive and free of detectable tumor for
the entire duration of the study (ie, >150 days). Collectively, these results provide strong experimental evidence
to suggest that CPE-based therapy may have great potential for the targeted treatment of ovarian cancer patients
harboring chemotherapy-resistant CD44þ cancer stem
cells.
In conclusion, we have shown that CD44þ /NFKB-high/MyD88þ ovarian cancer stem cells, which are
inherently resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, overexpress claudin-4 and may be highly susceptible to killing by
CPE-mediated therapy in vitro as well as in vivo. Taken
altogether, our findings suggest for the first time that intraperitoneal CPE administration may represent an
unconventional, potentially highly effective strategy to
eradicate ovarian CD44þ cancer stem cells after the elimination of the bulk of the disease using conventional cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
