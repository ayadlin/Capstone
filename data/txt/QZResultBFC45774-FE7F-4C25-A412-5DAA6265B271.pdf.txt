Abstract
Anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) is a novel biomarker with potential oncogenic
role. We sought to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic role of AGR2 on head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with an emphasis on its correlation of
cancer stemloid cells (CSC) and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found
that AGR2 protein levels were higher in HNSCC than in normal oral mucosa. High
levels of AGR2 were associated with the T category, pathological grade and lymph
node metastasis of HNSCC. Expression of AGR2 increased in recurring HNSCC after
radiotherapy and in post cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic tissues. In HNSCC cell
lines, knock-down of AGR2 induced apoptosis, reduced sphere formation, and downregulated Survivin, Cyclin D1, Bcl2, Bcl2l1, Slug, Snail, Nanog and Oct4. In addition,
over-expressed AGR2 in transgenic mice with spontaneous HNSCC was associated
with lost function of Tgfbr1 and/ or lost function of Pten. In vitro knockdown TGFBR1
in HNSCC cell lines increased AGR2 expression. These results suggest that AGR2 is
involved in EMT and self-renewal of CSC and may present a potential therapeutic
target (oncotarget) for HNSCC.

INTRODUCTION

cells [5]. Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) is
an evolutionarily developmental process [6]. Epithelial
cells gain mesenchymal characteristics and lose epithelial
characteristics, thereby becoming more invasive and with
stronger motility [7]. Accumulated studies demonstrated
that EMT is a common event in malignancies, and
contributes to the invasion process and cancer stem cell
development. Previous studies showed that metastasis
cancer cells, which probably underwent EMT, could
exhibit CSC phenotype [2]. Evidence suggests that the
Snail family plays crucial roles in inducing EMT in
cancers [8]. Moreover, aberrant expression of Snail2
(Slug) can induce radio resistance in cancer cells [8]. Snail
and Slug effectively mediate cell survival and are involved
in the acquisition of a self-renewal CSC-like trait (e.g.,
NANOG, HDAC1, DHAC3, TCF4, KLF4, and GPC3)
[8].

Cancer stem cells (CSC) or cancer initiating
cell are thought to be responsible for tumor metastasis,
chemoresistance, radioresistance and recurrence [1].
The CSC theory suggests that a part of cancer cells with
self-renewal and multi-potential differentiation abilities
are responsible for the maintenance and progression of
tumors [2, 3]. Existing researches showed that a small
group of proteins can be regarded as CSC markers.
ALDH1, a detoxifying enzyme that oxidizes intracellular
aldehydes, was reportedly a promising cancer stem cell
marker in numerous cancers comprising head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma [4] . Over expressions of Sox2
and Oct 4 in numerous malignancies were also reportedly
related to the pluripotency, proliferation, and self-renewal
properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and germ

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
with more than 450,000 newly diagnosed cases every
year, is the 6th most common cancer around the world
[9]. Despite intense research efforts, the morbidity and
mortality of HNSCC has remained nearly unchanged for
the past several decades [10]. As the oral cavity is the
most common site (almost 90%) of HNSCC[9], curative
systemic therapies for oral squamous cell carcinoma
(OSCC) are still lacking. Recurrence, cervical lymph
node metastasis, and radiotherapy and chemotherapy
resistance may be the most important factors affecting
the poor prognosis of HNSCC [11]. Thus, discovering the
mechanism underlying disease initiation and progression
is important. New biomarkers, especially HNSCC stem
cell molecular therapeutic targets, are urgently needed.
Anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2), the human
homolog of the Xenopus laevis-secreted protein XAG2, is strongly expressed in tissues that contain mucus
secreting cells [12]. Emerging evidences showed that
abnormal expression of AGR2 might be involved in
tumorigenesis and progression of human cancers, such
as prostate, breast, ovarian, esophagus, gastro-intestinal
tract, and lung cancers, as reviewed by Brychtova et al.
in Ref [13]. Increased AGR2 expression contributes to
metastasis because of its capacity to enhance migration
of breast cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma in
vitro and in vivo [14-16]. Recent reports showed that
aberrant AGR2 expression helps breast cancer cells
survive under serum-depleted conditions and/or hypoxic
culture conditions, promotes angiogenesis, and increases
cell invasion [17]. AGR2 can regulate breast cancer cells
growth and survival by modulating Survivin, C-myc, and
Cyclin D1 [18]. AGR2 is reportedly a P53 suppressor
and subsequently promotes cancer metastasis; AGR2 is
correlated with negative prognosis of cancer patients [1922]. These findings highlight the importance of AGR2 in
cancer initiation, progression, migration, and metastasis.
However, the underlying mechanism and biological
implication of AGR2, especially in cancer stem cell and
epithelial mesenchymal transition, remain unclear.
In this study, we aimed to characterize the
expression of AGR2 in human HNSCC tissue arrays and
to further determine the correlation and role of AGR2 in
cancer stem cell and EMT by in vitro functional assay and
in vivo observation using transgenic mice HNSCC models.

database [24]. In a meta-analysis of gene expression
profiling, increased AGR2 DNA copy number of
mRNA expression was significantly increased in many
cancers (e.g., esophagus, thyroid, ovarian, pancreatic,
breast, prostate, lung, and HNSCC) compared with the
normal counterpart (P < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 1),
thereby suggesting that AGR2 may act as an oncogene
in human cancer cells. In the Peng et al. dataset [25],
which independently performed DNA copy number
analysis on oral squamous cell carcinoma, 38 out of 112
OSCCs showed amplification of AGR2 copy number
(Fig. 1A). Through analyze the raw data of Ginos et al.
dataset [26] using Oncomine, we found the significantly
enhanced mRNA expression of AGR2 in 21 out of 54
HNSCCs compared with normal oral mucosa (Fig. 1B).
TCGA data sheet indicated an increase in the DNA copy
number of HNSCC (n = 290) compared with the normal
counterpart (blood, n = 338, Fig. 1C). Furthermore, to
assess the protein expression of AGR2 in human HNSCC
tissues, we performed immunohistochemistry in human
HNSCC tissue microarray (Fig. 1D). AGR2 exhibited
high expression in the cytoplasm and membrane of the
cancer cells (Fig. 1D). This analysis showed significantly
increased immunoreactivity of AGR2 in HNSCC (n = 59)
compared with dysplasia (n = 13, P < 0.001) and normal
oral mucosa (n = 39, P < 0.001, Fig. 1D with quantification
in Fig. 1E). High-grade (Grades II and III) HNSCC
presented intense AGR2 immunoreactivity compared
with low-grade (Grade I, n=20) HNSCC (P < 0.001, Fig.
2A with quantities in Fig. 2B). The expression of AGR2
was also associated with tumor size and with increased
AGR2 expression in T2 (n = 37) and T3 category (n = 13)
compared with the T1 category (n = 9, Fig. 2C). We also
noted a remarkable increase in AGR2 immunoreactivity
in the original tumor of the pathological lymph nodepositive patient (pN1, n = 20, P < 0.01, Fig. 2D) compared
with the pathological lymph node-negative patient (pN0,
n = 39). The results above indicated that AGR2 protein
expression correlated with high-grade HNSCC. To further
explore the prognosis value of AGR2 in HNSCC, Kaplan–
Meier method was used. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
S2, high AGR2 expression may indicate a rather poor
prognosis of HNSCC patient, whereas log-Rank analysis
indicated that cumulative rate of the patients with high
AGR2 (P = 0.1161, n = 29) expression did not reach
statistical significance.

cytoplasmic and nuclear areas of HNSCCs compared with
normal mucosa was observed. Expression of ALDH1 was
mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas the over expression of
Sox2, Oct4, and Slug was mainly found in the nuclear.
Afterward, Spearman rank correlation coefficient test and
linear tendency test were conducted. We found that the
protein expression of AGR2 in HNSCC was significantly
correlated with Survivin (P < 0.01, r = 0.2466), Cyclin D1
(P < 0.001, r = 0.4425), ALDH1 (P < 0.001, r = 0.5508),
Sox2 (P < 0.001, r = 0.4573), Oct4 (P < 0.001, r = 0.5606),
and Slug (P < 0.001, r = 0.5214) (Supplementary Figs. S3,
Supplementary Table 2). In addition, by using hierarchical
clustering analysis, we found that the expressions of pro-

survival marker Survivin and CSC marker were close
to the expression of AGR2 (Fig. 4B). The observation
above suggested that AGR2 might play a key role in prosurvival, EMT, and self-renewal, which is a characteristic
of cancer stem cells.

staining analysis, cell apoptosis was counted by flow
cytometry. Annexin V+/PI- apoptotic cell population
increased in AGR2 siRNA-treated CAL27 cell line
compared with the untreated and negative control siRNA
counterpart (Fig. 5A). Hoechst staining of siAGR2
increased the nuclear fragment as shown in Fig. 5B. The
colony formation ability and sphere formation assay is
widely used as a surrogate for self-renewal and colony
formation property of CSCs. Therefore, we performed
the sphere-forming assay to investigate the potential role
of AGR2 knock down in the self-renewal capacity of
CAL27 cells. Indeed, AGR2 siRNA reduced the colony

formation (Fig. 5C) when compared with the untreated
group and negative group. AGR2 siRNA treated CAL27
cells was found to form less and smaller spheres than the
counterpart (Fig. 5D) indicating its possible inhibition of
self-renewal of HNSCC cells in vitro. The apoptotic assay
and sphere formation assay are quiet repeatable in FaDu
cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4 A-C)
To verify whether AGR2 knockdown downregulated
the protein expressions of CSC and EMT markers, we
performed a Western blot analysis in the whole-cell
lysate collected from CAL27 cell and FaDu cell line
with or without AGR2 siRNA treatment. We found that
AGR2 siRNA consistently reduced pro-survival markers

of Tgfbr1/Pten in mice epithelia would lead to rapid
tumor formation (Fig. 6G) with pathological infiltrating
growth pattern (Fig. 6H) and poorly differentiated SCC
(High magnification in Fig. 6I). To determine whether
over-expression of AGR2 was related to high-grade
squamous cell carcinoma in mice, we performed AGR2
immunohistochemistry and found that AGR2 was located
mostly in the membrane and cytoplasm of the cancer cell
of Tgfbr1 cKO mice and Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice (n = 5,
respectively). However, AGR2 staining was negative in
wild type mice mucosa and focal weakly positive in Pten
cKO mice HNSCC (Fig. 7A with quantification histoscore
in Fig. 7B). The mRNA levels of AGR2 in Tgfbr1 cKO
mice and Tgfbr1/Pten mice were significantly higher
as compared with wild type mice mucosa (P < 0.001
respectively,Fig. 7C). We further knockdown TGFBR1

and/or PTEN in human HNSCC CAL27 and FaDu cell
lines. After transfection with PTEN and/or TGFBR1
siRNA for 48 h, the protein was extracted and analyzed
by Western blot. The protein level of AGR2 in PTEN,
TGFBR1 as well as in combined PTEN/ TGFBR1 knock
down was significantly higher than scramble siRNA in
CAL27 cell line (Fig. 7D and quantification in Fig. 7E)
and quiet repeatable in FaDu cell line Supplementary
Fig. S4E and 4F). The discovery above suggested that
increased AGR2 protein level may be associated with lost
function of TGFBR1.

DISCUSSION
The existence of CSCs has attracted a high amount
of attention recently because they are major contributing
factors to cancer recurrence and metastasis, which
severely increase HNSCC morbidity and motility[2].
The multidrug and radiotherapy resistance phenotype of
CSCs is responsible for radio-chemotherapy failure[28].
Recently, AGR2 expression is known to be regulated
at multiple levels. Using the Oncomine database, we
observed that AGR2 may serve as a promising oncogene
in human cancer. HNSCC showed an increased AGR2
DNA copy number ratio as well as AGR2 mRNA level.
Although mRNA and DNA copy numbers of AGR2 in

HNSCC were not as significant as in other cancers. The
protein expression of AGR2 in human HNSCC was
consistent with the DNA copy number and the mRNA
level, as indicated in this study as well as in other studies
[14, 16]. The present study is the first report that described
abnormal AGR2 expression in HNSCC with radiotherapy
and chemotherapy.
For the first time, we demonstrated the increase
of AGR2 protein in HNSCC in correlation with
aggressive phenotype HNSCC, as indicated by high
protein expression, high pathological grade, large tumor
burden, positive lymph node status, and recurrence [13].
Moreover, remarkable associations were found between
AGR2 and ALDH1, Sox2, Oct4, and Slug in human
HNSCC tissue. The high expression of AGR2 in HNSCC
in post-radiotherapy and post-chemotherapy tissues
was in agreement with the phenotype of CSCs, thereby
indicating that AGR2 may be associated with CSCs of
HNSCC. This correlation was further validated by direct
in vitro blockage of AGR2 using siRNA, which indicated
that AGR2 inhibition decreased the function and the selfrenewal markers of HNSCC CSCs. This finding is in
agreement with several reports, which stated that in other
cancers (breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer), AGR2 was
a marker that was used to determine negative prognosis
[20-22]. Nevertheless, in our present study, AGR2 was
not significantly correlated with the prognosis of HNSCC
patients, even if patients with high expression of AGR2
seemed to have longer survival time than those with low
expression of AGR2. Larger scale of cases and longer
follow up time are needed in future studies.
Interestingly, several reports indicated the close
relationship of EMT with cancer stem cell line phenotype.
Pathophysiological conditions, including tissue injury
or tumorigenesis, may trigger a stem-like phenotype
in differentiated cells during EMT induction [29]. This
phenomenon may mirror the developmentally regulated
EMT pathways, including Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog,
which also show CSC self-renewal and maintenance
[30, 31]. A recent report indicated that AGR2 enhanced
in vitro cell invasion and metastasis in HNSCC [14],
Thus, we hypothesized that AGR2 might enhance cancer
invasion by increasing EMT. Similar reports indicated that
AGR2 could promote cellular proliferation and metastasis
of HNSCC [16]. In our study, we verified the close
relationship of AGR2 protein expression with surrogate
EMT marker Slug in human HNSCC tissue. Additionally,
knockdown of AGR2 in vitro significantly decreased the
protein levels of two EMT-related transcription factors,
namely, Snail and Slug. Using transgenic mice, we also
observed that the increased expression of AGR2 was
correlated with epithelial Tgfbr1-deleted mice HNSCC,
which pathologically presents as high-grade SCC with the
EMT phenotype. The tumors of Tgfbr1 cKO and Tgfbr1/
Pten 2cKO mice expressed high levels of AGR2 and
presented a more aggressive phenotype. This finding was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in agreement with the report that AGR2 was regulated by
TGFβ1 and SMAD4 [32]. Our previous study suggested
that the loss of Tgfbr1 in epithelial cells would lead to
the accumulation of TGFβ1 in stroma [33]. In the present
study, an in vitro study revealed that AGR2 was regulated
by loss of Tgfbr1 in CAL27 cell lines.
Results of previous studies showed that AGR2
played an important role in cell proliferation, cell cycle
invasion, and poor response to chemotherapy [34]. A
recent report [35] suggested that AGR2 may promote
cancer cell invasion by increasing the expressions of
MUC1 and lysosomal enzymes cathespin B and cathepsin
D; thus, AGR2 overexpression plays an important role
in invasion, grading, and prognosis of HNSCC [3638]. Serum MUC1 and MUC1 immunoreactivities were
significantly correlated with grading and prognosis of
HNSCC [39]. AGR2 overexpression in primary breast
cancer is correlated with poor response to tamoxifen
treatment, which is Akt dependent [40]. AGR2 may also
suppress p53 by up-regulating MDM2 [34], which is an
important molecular event in human HNSCC. In our study,
we found that the overexpression of AGR2 was correlated
with lymph node-positive status, which was also reported
in gastric cancer [41]. Less known protein–protein
interactions and upstream and downstream molecular
regulation of AGR2 occur even in other species (e.g., fly
or yeast, Supplementary Fig. S6). Several studies indicated
that AGR2 may regulate c-Myc and Amphiregulin, as well
as EGFR [42]. In the present study, we showed for the
first time that in vitro knockdown AGR2 may be correlated
with self-renewal markers, such as Sox2, ALDH1, and
Oct4. The so called “cancer stem cell” in this study is
actually proliferating cancer stem cell (cancer stemloid) [1,
43]. Our data indicated that AGR2 may regulate Survivin,
an important member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis family,
which has been revealed to interfere with cell apoptosis.
This observation agreed with the results of similar studies
on breast cancer [18], thereby suggesting that inhibition
of AGR2 reduced the protein level of Survivin and Cyclin
D1.
In summary, we identified the clinical significance
of AGR2 in human HNSCC tissues, and further showed
that AGR2 promoted HNSCC progression and radiochemotherapy by regulating CSC and EMT signaling
pathways. The upstream regulation of TGFBR1 on The
above data suggested AGR2 was also clarified. AGR2 is a
potential therapeutic oncotarget of HNSCC.

Human head neck cancer cell line CAL27 cells
were bought from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) in 2012 and maintained in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO­
2 and 37°C
in a humidified incubator. The CAL27 cell line was
characterized and authenticated by STR method with
100% of match. TGFBR1 siRNA, PTEN siRNA, and
combined TGFBR1/ PTEN siRNA were transfected into
appropriate cells using HiPerfect transfection reagent
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD) with a final concentration
of 5nM as previous described[44, 45]. AGR2 siRNA
(Qiagen), were transfected in CAL27 cell in final
concentration of 5nM. All-star negative controls (Qiagen)
were used as negative controls to confirm there is no
interference with other miRNAs. MAPK1 siRNA and
Cell Death siRNA (Qiagen) were used as positive controls
[44, 45]. For inhibition efficiency and target mRNA
transcription studies, RNA was extracted 24 h after
transfection. For protein extraction, cells were harvested
48 h after transfection. The morphologic changes of
CAL27 treated with indicated siRNA were captured using
fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33258 staining.

In order to immunofluorescent staining, CAL27 cells
were seeded on coverglass slide chambers (Millipore).

secondary antibodies with 4’, 6’-diamidino-2-phenylidole
(DAPI) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West
Grove, PA) for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.
The primary antibodies included the following: AGR2
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200), Suvivin
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200), Cyclin D1
antibody (Epitomics, 1:200). The slides were observed
by a fluorescent microscope. Representative cells were
selected and photographed.

Quantitative real-time PCR
miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was
used to extract the total RNA from Pten cKO, mice, Tgfbr1
cKO mice, Pten/Tgfbr1 2cKO mice. RNA quality control
was performed as previously described [44]. Mouse Agr2
primer was purchased from Qiagen. The mRNAs were
subjected to quantitative 2-step real-time PCR using
invitrogen transcript III kit and SYBR green PCR kit (BioRad). qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate on the Chrom
4 real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using
a GAPDH probe as an internal control, according to the
protocol suggested by the manufacturer.

Annexin V/PI staining
After being transfected AGR2 siRNA (Qiagen) in
final concentration of 5nM, CAL27 cells were detached by
trypsin-EDTA. Annexin V/PI (BD Pharmingen) staining
was carried out following manufacture’s instruction. The
cells were then counted by flow cytometer as previous
described [46].

Western blot

Colony formation assay and sphere formation
assay

CAL cell lines were treated with the indicated
concentrations AGR2 siRNA, TGFBR1 siRNA, PTEN
siRNA and TGFBR1/PTEN combined siRNA in DMEM
for 48h. Then the cells were lysed, and the total protein
was separated by using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Then blots were developed by Enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit (West Pico, Thermo).
GAPDH was detected on the same membrane and used as
a loading control.

Anchorage-dependent in vitro colony formation
assay were performed as previously described [45].
Briefly, CAL27 cells were seeded at a density of 600
cells per well in flat-bottomed six-well culture plates.
After colonies were visible, the colonies were fixed by
methanol and stained by crystal violet (Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The percentage of cells that formed
into a clone was calculated.CAL27 cells were treated with
siAGR2 with counterpart control as described above.
Sphere cell culture was preformed according to published
protocol with minor modifications [47].Briefly, single-cell
suspensions were plated in six-well ultralow attachment
plates (Corning Inc.) at a density of 1,000 cells/mL. Cells

1:200), ALDH1 (Proteintech gruop, 1:100), (Epitomics,
1:200), OCT4 (Proteintech gruop, 1:100), Slug (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:200). Then, the sections were
incubated with a secondary biotinylated immunoglobulin
G antibody solution and an avidin-biotin-peroxidase
reagent. After being washed with phosphate buffer saline,
the sections were incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
tetrachloride and then lightly counterstained with Mayer’s
haematoxylin.

All experiments were conducted in accordance
with guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Wuhan University. Time inducible
tissue specific Tgfbr1/Pten 2cKO mice (K14-CreERtam;
Tgfbr1flox/flox; Ptenflox/flox), Tgfbr1 cKO mice (K14-CreERtam;
Tgfbr1flox/flox), Pten cKO mice (K14-CreERtam; Pten flox/flox)
were maintained and genotyped according to published
protocols [44, 45]. All the mice were FVBN/CD1/129/
C57 mixed background.

Scoring system, hierarchical clustering and data
visualization

Patients, tumor samples and human HNSCC
tissue array

Whole slices were scanned using an Aperio
ScanScope CS scanner (Vista, CA, USA) with background
substrate for each slice, and quantified using Aperio
Quantification software (Version 9.1) for membrane,
nuclear, or pixel quantification [49]. An area of interest was
selected either in the epithelial or the cancerous area for
scanning and quantification. Histoscore of membrane and
nuclear staining was calculated as a percentage of different
positive cells using the formula (3+)×3+(2+)×2+(1+)×1.
Histoscore of pixel quantification was calculated as total
intensity/total cell number [44]. The threshold for scanning
of different positive cells was set according to the standard
controls provided by Aperio [33, 44].The expression
scores were converted into scaled values centered on zero
in Microsoft excel. Then the hierarchical analysis was
achieved by the Cluster 3.0 with average linkage based on
Person’s correlation coefficient [50]. Java TreeView 1.0.5
was used to visualize the results [51]. Finally, we arranged
the clustered data and tissue samples on the horizontal axis
and vertical axis respectively. Biomarkers with a close
relationship are located next to each other.

The School and Hospital of Stomatology of
Wuhan University Medical Ethics Committee approved
this study, and informed consent was obtained from the
patients before they underwent surgery. 59 patients tissues
with histologically confirmed HNSCC in the Hospital
of Stomatology of Wuhan University between January
2008 and August 2010 were recruited. Their clinical and
histological data are provided in Supplementary Table
1. The clinical stages of their HNSCC were classified
according to the guidelines of the International Union
Against Cancer (UICC 2002), and histological grading
was determined according to the scheme of the World
Health Organisation. Custom made tissue arrays of
formalin-fixed tissues from HNSCC mentioned above
were constructed with 1.5mm core from each patient
(T12-412) [44] and T12-412-2) mentioned above. These
tissue microarray slides included 59 confirmed cases of
HNSCC, 39normal oral mucosa and 13 oral epithelial
dysplasia, 5 paired lymph node metastasis, 5 recurrences
after radiotherapy and 12 TPF chemotherapy. The 12
HNSCC patients receive 2 round combined cisplatin,
docetaxel, and fluorouracil therapy with the same protocol
of Zhang’s clinical trial [48]. Patient samples with both
biopsy as well as surgical specimen after 2 rounds were
involved in these custom-made tissue microarrays.

Statistical analysis
Data analyses were performed using Graph Pad
Prism version 5.0 for Windows (Graph Pad Software Inc,
La Jolla, CA). One-way ANOVA followed by the postTukey or Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were
used to analyze the differences in immunostaining and
protein levels among each group. Paired t test was used to
analyze immunohistochemical staining of AGR2 in TPF
chemotherapy specimen and difference between original
HNSCC and metastatic lymph nodes. Two-tailed Pearson’s
statistics was used for correlated expression of AGR2,
Survivin, Cyclin D1, ALDH1, Sox2, Oct4 and Slug after
confirmation of the sample with Gaussian distribution.
Survival curves were plotted using the method of KaplanMeier and the significance of observed differences was
accessed with log-rank test. Mean values ± SEM with
a difference of P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Immunohistochemical staining
All paraffin-embedded specimens were cut into
4-µm sections and dried at 60 °C for 2 h, deparaffinised
and dehydrated. The sections were then boiled in 0.01
M citric acid buffer solution (pH 6.0) for 1.5 min at
high pressure. After being incubated with 3% hydrogen
superoxide for 20 minutes to quench endogenous
peroxidase activity and 10% normal goat serum to
block non-specific binding, the sections were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-human
AGR2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200), Survivin (Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:200), Cyclin D1 (Epitomics,
