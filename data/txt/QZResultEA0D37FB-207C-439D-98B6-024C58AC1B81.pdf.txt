Abstract
Medulloblastoma, originating in the cerebellum, is the most common malignant brain tumor in children.
Medulloblastoma consists of four major groups where constitutive activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)
signaling pathway is a hallmark of one group. Mouse and human SHH medulloblastomas exhibit increased
expression of microRNAs encoded by the miR-1792 and miR-106b25 clusters compared with granule
progenitors and postmitotic granule neurons. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential of 8-mer seedtargeting locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modiﬁed anti-miR oligonucleotides, termed tiny LNAs, that inhibit
microRNA seed families expressed by miR-1792 and miR-106b25 in two mouse models of SHH medulloblastomas. We found that tumor cells (medulloblastoma cells) passively took up 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs and
speciﬁcally inhibited targeted microRNA seed-sharing family members. Inhibition of miR-17 and miR-19a
seed families by anti-miR-17 and anti-miR-19, respectively, resulted in diminished tumor cell proliferation in
vitro. Treatment of mice with systemic delivery of anti-miR-17 and anti-miR-19 reduced tumor growth in
ﬂank and brain allografts in vivo and prolonged the survival of mice with intracranial transplants, suggesting
that inhibition of the miR-1792 cluster family by 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs might be considered for the
treatment of SHH medulloblastomas. Cancer Res; 73(23); 7068–78. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma, a cerebellar tumor, is the most common malignant pediatric brain cancer (1). Molecular proﬁling classiﬁes human medulloblastomas into four major
subgroups with distinct mRNA and miRNA signatures:
Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), WNT, group 3 (G3), and group 4
(G4; ref. 2). As current therapies induce adverse effects that
compromise patients' quality of life (3, 4), novel therapeutic
options have become a necessity. Small-molecule inhibitors
of Smoothened (SMO) are effective at eliminating murine
(5) and human (6) SHH medulloblastomas. However, treatment of young mice with the SHH antagonist induces longbone defects (7). In the clinic, one patient with signiﬁcant

remission after treatment with GDC-0449 developed resistance due to SMO mutation (8). These recent results suggested that other approaches are necessary to treat SHH
medulloblastomas.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous noncoding RNAs of
approximately 22 nucleotides, which play key roles in numerous biologic processes, including cancer (9). They bind to
partially complementary sequences within the 30 -untranslated
regions (UTR) of target mRNAs inducing translational repression or mRNA degradation (10). The miR-1792 cluster
belongs to a family of 3 clusters encoded on different chromosomes (11). They include miR-1792, also called OncomiR-1,
which encodes 6 miRNAs (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a,
miR-19b-1, and miR-92-1), miR-106b25, which encodes 3
miRNAs (miR-106b, miR-93m and miR-25), and miR-106a363,
which encodes 6 miRNAs (miR-106a, miR-18b, miR-20b, miR19b-2, miR-92-2, and miR-363). Individual miRNAs are classiﬁed into 4 families based on sequence similarities within their
6-nucleotide seed sequence (Fig. 1A; refs. 11, 12). The oncogenic
potential of miR-1792 was discovered in B-cell lymphomas
(13), with the miR-19a/b family responsible for tumorigenicity
(14, 15).
Several mouse models of SHH medulloblastomas exist
with mutation of Smo (16), Ptch1 alone (17), or with loss of
Trp53 (18) or the cyclin-dependent kinase–inhibitory proteins, p18Ink4c/Cdkn2c or p27Kip1/Cdkn1b (19, 20). Mouse and
human SHH medulloblastomas exhibit high levels of miRNAs
encoded by miR-1792 and miR-106b25 (21, 22) with ampliﬁcation of miR-1792 found in less than 10% of human

medulloblastomas (22). Enforced expression of miR-1792
increases proliferation of postnatal day 7 (P7) cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNP; ref. 22) and collaborates with
mutated Ptch1 to induce medulloblastoma in mice (21). We
hypothesized that targeting members of the miRNA seed
families from miR-1792 and miR-106b25 could serve as
potential therapies for the treatment of SHH medulloblastomas. We recently reported that tiny locked nucleic acids (LNA)
inhibit the function of miRNAs, including miRNA seed families
(23–25). Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of 8mer LNA-anti-miRs in inhibiting miR-17, 20a, 106b, and 93
(anti-miR-17) and miR-19a and 19b-1 (anti-miR-19) in 2 murine
SHH medulloblastoma models.

Materials and Methods
Animal husbandry
[Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] and [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] mice develop SHH medulloblastomas. Transplants were conducted in 1- to
2-month-old CD-1 nude (CD-1) mice (Charles River Laboratories). [NestinCreþ/;miR-1792ﬂoxed/ﬂoxed;miR-106b-25/] double knockout (DKO) mice were generated by conditionally
deleting miR-1792 (11) in cells expressing the Cre recombinase driven by the Nestin promoter (26) in an miR-106b25-null background (11). Mice were housed in an accredited facility
of the Association for Assessment of Laboratory Animal Care in
accordance with the NIH guidelines. The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of SJCRH approved all procedures in
this study.

Puriﬁcation, culture, and LNA-anti-miR treatment of
medulloblastoma cells
Primary medulloblastoma cells from spontaneously arisen
SHH medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] mice
were puriﬁed and cultured as previously described (27).
Medulloblastoma cells were treated with tiny LNAs targeting
the seed region of miR-17, miR-19a, or the 8-mer scrambled
LNA control (referred to as anti-miR-17, anti-miR-19, and
scrambled LNA). After 48 hours, medulloblastoma cells
were harvested with trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals)
and ovomucoid (trypsin inhibitor, Worthington Biochemicals) solutions for further analysis. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) was used to assess bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation following a 2-hour pulse of 10
mmol/L BrdUrd (BD Pharmingen, 552598) and the percentage of Annexin V–positive cells. To determine the efﬁciency
of uptake, medulloblastoma cells were treated with 8 mmol/L
6-carboxyﬂuorescein (FAM) tiny LNAs. Tiny LNA sequences
were (50 –30 ): anti-miR-17, AGCACTTT; anti-miR-19, ATTTGCAC; scrambled LNA control, TCATACTA, as previously
published (23).
Medulloblastoma allografts
Pretreatment with tiny LNAs before transplant. A total
of 2  106 medulloblastoma cells were treated with tiny
LNAs during a 30-minute preplating step, harvested, resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and injected subcutaneously into the ﬂank of CD-1 mice. A subset of mice was
sacriﬁced 14 days after transplant when ﬂank tumors were

palpable. Tumors were sectioned and stained for the FAM
label using an anti-FAM–conjugated AlexaFluor 594. The
presence of tiny LNAs was visualized by confocal microscopy. The remaining mice were imaged weekly using the
VEVO-770 High-Resolution 3-Dimension Ultrasound Imaging System, and tumor volumes were measured by tracing
tumors within virtual sections of the 3D image stack (VisualSonics). Mice were sacriﬁced when the size of the tumor was
greater than 20% of the total animal body mass.
Intravenous tiny LNA administration after transplant. Three spontaneous medulloblastomas from
[Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice were maintained by transplantation in the ﬂank of CD-1 mice. Each tumor was puriﬁed and
infected with lentiviruses encoding a spleen focus-forming
virus-LTR driving 2A peptide–linked luciferase and yellow
ﬂuorescent protein (YFP; CL20-luc2aYFP). Forty-eight
hours later, cells were subjected to FACS and 1  106
YFP-positive cells were transplanted into the left ﬂank of
recipient animals (day 0). For cranial transplants, 0.5  106
YFP-positive cells were injected into the cortices of CD-1
mice, as described previously (21). Bioluminescence imaging
of luciferase activity monitored tumor growth twice weekly
using a Xenogen IVIS-200 system prior and during LNA
treatment. Three milligrams of D-luciferin (Caliper Life
Sciences) was administered to each mouse intraperitoneally, 5 to 7 minutes before bioluminescence imaging. Radiance
(photons/s/cm2/steridian) was determined within regions
of interest (ﬂank or head of mice) using Living Image
Software version 4.3.1 (Caliper Life Sciences). Bioluminescence imaging detected luciferase in medulloblastoma cells
the day after transplant (day 1) with an intensity  1.3  106
radiance. Mice received intravenous (i.v.) injections via tail
vein of saline-formulated tiny LNAs (scrambled, anti-miR-17,
or anti-miR-19) or an equal volume of saline, with an initial
loading dose of 25 mg/kg (day 2). For ﬂank transplants,
maintenance doses of tiny LNAs were administered twice
weekly at 10 mg/kg (days 6, 9, 13, and 16). Mice were
sacriﬁced 24 to 72 hours after the last dose of tiny LNAs.
For cranial transplants, maintenance doses of 20 mg/kg
were given on days 6 and 9. Mice were sacriﬁced when they
became lethargic and displayed neurological signs (e.g.,
head tilting, head dome, failure to thrive), which occurred
5 to 8 days after transplant for mice treated with saline or
scrambled LNA.
Blood–brain barrier integrity
Three mice with intracranial transplantation of 0.5  106
YFP-positive medulloblastoma cells from one [Ptch1þ/;
Trp53/] tumor were injected i.v. with either 2 mL/kg of
2% Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich, E2129) in 0.9% saline 6 days
after transplant or 25 mg/kg FAM-labeled scrambled LNA 2
weeks after transplant. Evans blue is a dye with a high afﬁnity
for serum albumin not normally present in the brain (28, 29).
Mice that received Evans blue were euthanized by cardiac
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 hours later. Mice
that received tiny LNA injections were perfused after 30 and
60 minutes. Brains were cryoprotected in sucrose, frozen and
sectioned for immunohistochemistry.

RNA extraction, quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from spontaneous medulloblastomas, puriﬁed
tumor cells and ﬂank allografts was extracted, reverse transcribed, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for miRNAs
was conducted, as described previously [ref. 21; ABI, catalogue
number 4427975 and assay ID numbers ¼ 001093 002308
(RNU6B), (hsa-miR-17), 002422 (hsa-miR-18a), 000580 (hsamiR-20a), 000395 (hsa-miR-19a), 000396 (hsa-miR-19b),
000430 (hsa-miR-92), 000442 (hsa-miR-106b), 001090 (mmumiR-93)]. Relative levels of microRNAs were quantiﬁed in
triplicate. Ct values were normalized within the same RNA
sample to the small nuclear RNA RNU6B and to P6 GNPs
(relative value ¼ 1).
Plasmid construction, cell culture, and 30 -UTR
luciferase assay
The luciferase assay was conducted using the pmirGLO
dual-luciferase miRNA target expression vector (pmirGLO;
Promega). Oligonucleotides containing predicted or mutated
miR-17 and miR-19 binding sites within Bmpr2, Smad5, and
Smad4 30 -UTR sequences (see Supplementary Table S1) were
cloned into pmirGLO according to manufacturer's instructions. SAOS-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mmol/L
glutamine, and 100 units each of penicillin and streptomycin
(GIBCO) at 37 C and 8% CO2. Cells were obtained from
Dr. Emma Lees (DNAX) in September 1994 and tested by
immunoblotting with antibodies to p53 (SC#100 and Sc#99)
and Rb (Pharmingen, G3-245) before being frozen down in
September 1994. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2.0  104
cells per well) and cotransfected the next day with 10 ng
of pmirGLO reporter plasmids and 0 to 200 ng of MSCVmiR-17  92-IRES-GFP, using Fugene HD (Promega). pCMV6
was used as control. Cells were lysed 48 hours later, and DualLuciferase Reporter Assays (Promega) were conducted on a
Synergy 2 Biotek microplate reader.
Immunoblotting
P6 cerebella from wild-type and DKO mice were lysed using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and proteins
were extracted and 50 mg of proteins immunoblotted, as
previously described (30), using antibodies to BMPR-II (BD
Biosciences, 1:100) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc;
1:2,000). The relative densities of Bmpr2 and actin bands were
quantiﬁed using the gel analyzer plug-in on ImageJ64 (version
10.2; NIH) and normalized to relative Bmpr2 density in a
NIH3T3 cell lysate (relative density ¼ 1).
FISH
FISH for miR-1792 was conducted on 10 mouse
SHH medulloblastomas [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/ (n ¼ 6);
Ptch1þ/;Trp53/ (n ¼ 4)] using the BAC clones RP23132K20 for miR-1792 and RP23-35N6 for the chromosome
14 band A3 (30).

cluster was signiﬁcantly overexpressed in puriﬁed medulloblastoma cells of independently derived medulloblastomas
spontaneously arisen from 6 [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] mice (19)
and 4 [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice (18) compared with 1-monthold cerebellum from C57BL/6 mice. None of the 10 tumors
showed ampliﬁcation of miR-1792 (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B). miR-19a was the highest expressed in both SHH
medulloblastoma mouse models followed by miR-20a in
medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] and miR-17
in medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice (Fig. 1B).

were treated with FAM-labeled tiny LNAs for 0.5, 1, 24, and
48 hours and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at
room temperature. Cells were counterstained with wheat germ
agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 and with 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) according
to Invitrogen's instructions. WGA is a lectin that binds to
N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid)
residues within the plasma membrane (31). Cells and tumor
sections were stained with antibodies to Ki-67 (Leica, 1:1,000),
FAM-AF594 (Invitrogen, 1:500), or GFP (Abcam, 1:500). Counterstained and immunostained cells were imaged using confocal microscopy (for details, see Supplementary Material). The
number of FAM-, DAPI-, or Ki-67–positive cells was counted in
each optical section using the cell counter plug-in on ImageJ64
(version 10.2; NIH). Four hundred or more cells, based on DAPI
expression, were counted per treatment condition.
Macroscopic images of Evans blue dye within whole-mount
mouse brain tumor and brain tumor sections were captured
using the iSight camera on an iPhone 4S. Statistical signiﬁcance
was determined using the Student t test on GraphPad Prism
software (version 5.0).

Efﬁcient miRNA silencing within medulloblastoma cells
by 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs
To assess tiny LNA uptake and subcellular localization,
8 mmol/L of FAM-labeled tiny LNAs were added directly to
the culture medium. Medulloblastoma cells puriﬁed from
3 independently derived spontaneously occurring [Ptch1þ/;
Cdkn2c/] tumors were incubated for different times before
ﬁxation and counterstained with WGA and DAPI. Confocal
imaging revealed tiny LNAs in the nucleus and the cytosol of
the cell soma and proximal neurites within 30 minutes after
addition of tiny LNAs (Fig. 2A and B). FAM was observed in
most cells treated with anti-miR-17, anti-mR-19, and scrambled LNA (Fig. 2C).
To assess the speciﬁcity of the LNA-anti-miRs in inhibiting
miRNA function, RNA was extracted from medulloblastoma
cells treated with anti-miR-17 and anti-miR-19a for 48 hours

followed by qRT-PCR analysis of miR-17 and miR-19a levels
within each sample from 3 tumors. The relative miR-17 and
miR-19a levels in anti-miR-17- and anti-miR-19–treated cells,
respectively, were decreased in each tumor compared with
cells untreated or treated with scrambled LNA (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and S2B).
8-mer LNA-anti-miRs suppress medulloblastoma
proliferation in vitro
To determine whether 8-mer anti-miRs led to suppression of
medulloblastoma proliferation in vitro, medulloblastoma cells
were treated for 48 hours with 8 mmol/L tiny LNAs based on a
dose response (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Cells were harvested
and counted. There was no signiﬁcant change in the number of
cells treated with the scrambled LNA compared with those left
untreated. In contrast, we found signiﬁcantly fewer cells after
treatment with anti-miR-17, anti-miR-19, or anti-miR-17 with
anti-miR-19 compared with untreated or scrambled LNA–
treated controls; however, we did not observe an enhanced
phenotype following treatment with both anti-miRs compared
with either anti-miR alone (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Thus,
each anti-miR was tested separately for the remainder of the
experiments.

Tiny LNAs were added to 2  106 tumor cells from 4

ultrasound imaging arose between 2 weeks and 1 month after

weight (Fig. 3B) than those untreated or scrambled LNA–
treated cells.
To determine whether the repression of ﬂank tumor proliferation corresponded to a decrease in miRNA levels,
RNAs from tumors were subjected to qRT-PCR. Tumors that

Silencing of miR-1792 in Medulloblastoma

arose from medulloblastoma cells treated with anti-miR-17
or anti-miR-19 exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in the relative
levels of miR-17 and miR-19a seed sharing family members,
respectively (Fig. 3C). The relative levels of miR-92, an
miRNA that is not targeted by the 2 anti-miRs, were
unchanged. Thus, 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs inhibit their cognate
seed-sharing miRNA family members in vivo, as previously
reported (23).
Intravenous treatment of mice with 8-mer LNA-antimiRs inhibits tumor progression
As the levels of miRNAs encoded by miR-1792 were
similar between tumors from [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] and
[Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] mice, and the loss of Trp53 in
[Ptch1þ/] mice facilitated tumor transplants compared
with the [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] model, we used the
[Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] medulloblastomas to test the effects of
tiny LNAs in vivo. A total of 1  106 YFP and luciferaseexpressing tumor cells originating from 3 spontaneously
occurring medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice
(tumor A, B, and C) were transplanted into the left ﬂank
of immunocompromised recipient CD-1 mice. In all 3 cases,
i.v. administration of anti-miR-17 or anti-miR-19 resulted
in inhibition of ﬂank tumor progression, as measured by
luciferase activity (Fig. 4A–D), and decreased tumor weight
(Fig. 4E). The inhibition of tumor progression was correlated
with a signiﬁcant decrease in the relative levels of miR-17
and miR-19a seed-sharing families (Fig. 4F).
The blood–brain barrier is compromised following
intracranial tumor cell transplantation
A major obstacle of using 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs for the
treatment of brain tumors is their inability to cross the intact
blood–brain barrier (BBB; ref. 23). Following intracranial
transplant, Evans blue or FAM-labeled scrambled LNA were
administered i.v. to 3 mice. We observed Evans blue dye
accumulation around the implant site and tumor extravasation (Fig. 5A). FAM accumulation was similarly detected in
tumors from three mice that received FAM-labeled scrambled
LNA (Fig. 5B), suggesting that cranial implants compromise
the BBB.
8-mer LNA-anti-miRs inhibit medulloblastoma
progression in the brain and increases survival
To determine whether treatment with 8-mer LNA-antimiRs could be effective in suppressing the proliferation of
medulloblastomas transplanted into the brain, we transplanted 0.5  106 YFP and luciferase-positive cells from one
of the medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice
into the cortices of CD-1 mice. Tumor-bearing mice were
treated i.v. with saline-formulated tiny LNAs, and tumor
growth was assessed using bioluminescence imaging.
Tumors that developed in the cortices of mice treated with
anti-miR-17 or anti-miR-19 exhibited less luciferase activity
(Fig. 5C and D) and led to a 6-day and 3- to 4-day increase in
mean survival, respectively, compared with saline and
scrambled LNA–treated controls (Fig. 5E). Mice treated with
tiny LNAs did not show any apparent signs of toxicity-

related illness such as weight loss. qRT-PCR analysis
revealed that tumors that arose from mice treated with
anti-miR-17 had signiﬁcantly reduced levels of miR-17,
whereas its seed-sharing miR levels were not as signiﬁcantly
affected. Tumors treated with anti-miR-19 showed no signiﬁcant reduction of the relative levels of miR-19a seedsharing miRs (Fig. 5F).
miR-17 and miR-19 target Bmpr2
The miR-1792 cluster targets SMAD2/3 (32) and SMAD4
(33), key effectors within the TGFb signaling cascade, and
BMPR2 within the BMP signaling cascade in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (34). Here, we tested whether
miR-17 and miR-19 targeted members of the BMP signaling
pathway, which dominantly and irreversibly induce the differentiation of SHH medulloblastomas (27). Using TargetScan,
we found that Bmpr2, Smad5, and Smad4 contained predicted
binding sites for miR-17 and miR-19a within their 30 -UTR.
We used the ﬁreﬂy–Renilla dual luciferase reporter assay
to test whether miR-1792 induced posttranscriptional
repression of Bmpr2, Smad5, or Smad4. Transfections were
conducted in the SAOS-2 cell line due to its relatively low
expression levels of the miR-1792 cluster (http://www.
microrna.org). We observed a concentration-dependent
repression of Bmpr2 luciferase reporter activity with increasing concentrations of miR-1792, which was not observed
with Smad5 or Smad4 luciferase reporters (Supplementary
Fig. S4A and S4B). Mutations in the miR-17 and miR-19a
predicted binding sites of the Bmpr2 30 -UTR caused a
derepression of luciferase activity (Fig. 6A), implicating
Bmpr2 as a target of miR-17 and miR-19. These data were
conﬁrmed by Bmpr2 immunoblots of lysates from P6 cerebella from DKO and wild-type mice (Fig. 6B and C).

Discussion
We investigated the role of miR-17 and miR-19a seedsharing family members in medulloblastoma proliferation
by inhibiting their function using 8-mer LNA-modiﬁed antimiRs directed against their seed sequences, designated as
anti-miR-17 and anti-miR-19. We found miR-19a, miR-17,
and miR-20a to be the highest expressed miRNAs from
miR-1792 within medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;
Cdkn2c/] and [Ptch1þ/;Trp53/] mice. Interestingly,
overexpression of miR-19a and miR-19b are both capable
of inducing B-cell lymphoma (14, 15). The differential
expression of individual miRNAs from this cluster is
explained, in part, by the tertiary structure of the miR1792 pri-miRNA. Chaulk and colleagues revealed that this
pri-miRNA cluster adopts a compact globular tertiary structure containing the 30 -miRNA hairpins (miR-19b and miR92) within a core enveloped by the 50 -miRNA hairpins (miR17, miR-19a, miR-20a), thereby affecting the efﬁciency of
Drosha processing and the regulation of target mRNAs (35).
Tiny LNAs passively and efﬁciently entered medulloblastoma cells without the need of transfection or electroporation. In vitro treatment of puriﬁed medulloblastoma cells
with anti-miR-17 or anti-miR-19 decreased their proliferation

miRNAs encoded by the miR-1792 cluster family within
SHH medulloblastoma cells (36).
Our transplantation experiments provide several insights
when considering the development of miRNA-based therapies for treatment of SHH medulloblastomas. First, we
previously found variability in the expression of miRNAs
from miR-1792 within human and mouse SHH medulloblastomas (21), which correlated with the fact that not all
SHH medulloblastomas from [Ptch1þ/;Cdkn2c/] mice
gave rise to secondary tumors in ﬂank transplants. Interestingly, the relative expression levels of miR-17 and miR19a were at least 2 to 3 times higher in transplantable
tumors compared with those that were not (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Tumor sensitivity to 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs was
correlated with the expression levels of miR-1792 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Second, tiny LNAs were present in
transplantable tumors for at least 14 days following medulloblastoma cell pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S6).
These data are consistent with previous ﬁndings showing
the in vivo stability of tiny LNAs up to 21 days (23). Finally,
we observed that tumors derived from cells pretreated with
anti-miR-17 were smaller than those originating from cells
pretreated with anti-miR-19. Similar results were obtained
when tiny LNAs were administered intravenously into
immunocompromised mice carrying ﬂank and cranial allografts. One possible explanation is that anti-miR-17 targets
the seed region of 4 miRNAs (miR-17, 20a, 106b, 93), possibly
exhibiting a broader effect on medulloblastoma miRNAmediated regulatory networks than anti-miR-19, which only
targets 2 miRNAs (miR-19a and 19b-1).
Although systemic delivery of anti-miR-21 shows high levels
of uptake and accumulation in the kidney cortex, liver, lymph

7076

nodes, bone marrow, and spleen of mice (23, 37), one of the
major obstacles of using antisense oligonucleotides, including
tiny LNAs, in the treatment of brain tumors is their inefﬁcient
delivery across the BBB (23). In this intracranial transplant
model, the BBB was clearly compromised. However, it is
unclear whether the integrity of the BBB is disrupted in
children with medulloblastoma, which would facilitate brain
penetration (38, 39). Other strategies to achieve direct delivery
to tumors might be considered, including continuous infusion
of tiny LNAs into the ventricles using minipumps (40) or the
use of nanoparticles.
As the use of LNA-anti-miRs in non-human primates
and humans is efﬁcacious and safe (41–45), our data suggest
that 8-mer LNA-anti-miRs targeting miR-1792 and
miR-106b25 may have therapeutic application for the treatment of human SHH medulloblastomas expressing high levels
of miR-1792 (22). The therapeutic value of LNA-anti-miRs in
medulloblastoma could be extended to other oncomiRs such
as, miR-1204 encoded by PVT1 and frequently fused to MYC in
G3 medulloblastomas (46) and miR-182, which promotes G3
medulloblastoma cell proliferation and migration (47) and
leptomeningeal spread of non-SHH medulloblastomas (48).
