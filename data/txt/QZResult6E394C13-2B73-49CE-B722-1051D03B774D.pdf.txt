ABSTRACT:

Id proteins (Id-1 to 4) are dominant negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors. They play a key role during development, preventing cell
differentiation while inducing cell proliferation. They are poorly expressed in adult life
but can be reactivated in tumorigenesis. Several evidences indicate that Id proteins are
associated with loss of differentiation, unrestricted proliferation and neoangiogenesis
in diverse human cancers. Recently, we identified Id4 as a transcriptional target of the
protein complex mutant p53/E2F1/p300 in breast cancer. Id4 protein binds, stabilizes
and enhances the translation of mRNAs encoding proangiogenic cytokines, such as
IL8 and GRO-alpha, increasing the angiogenic potential of cancer cells. We present
here an overview of the current experimental data that links Id4 to cancer. We provide
evidence also of the induction of Id4 following anticancer treatments in mutant p53carrying cells. Indeed, mutant p53 is recruited to a specific region of the Id4 promoter
upon DNA damage. Our findings indicate that Id4, besides its proangiogenic role, might
also participate in the chemoresistance associated to mutant p53 proteins exerting
gain of function activities.

INTRODUCTION

binding domain, is known as Inhibitors of DNA binding
(Id) genes. The proteins encoded by these genes act as
dominant-negative regulators of bHLH proteins by forming inactive heterodimeric complexes. In mammals there
are four known Id gene family members known as Id1, Id2,
Id3 and Id4. The best characterized Id protein interaction
is with the ubiquitously expressed bHLH E proteins (E2-2,
E12, E47), which heterodimerize with tissue-specific
bHLH proteins, such as MyoD (in muscle) and NeuroD (in
nerves).
The identity between the HLH regions of Id proteins
is very high, while the remaining regions of the proteins
are not conserved. A study from Kieviz and Cabrele [3]
reported that the N- and C-terminal fragments of Id proteins do not adopt a helical conformation, with the exception of Id4 fragment 27-64. This helix propensity is dictated

The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors has been shown to play a key role in the differentiation processes of a number of cell lineages. These
proteins contain an HLH domain, which mediates homoand hetero-dimerization, plus an adjacent DNA-binding
region rich in basic amino acids. The bHLH proteins bind
to a DNA sequence known as E-box (CANNTG). There are
two major categories of bHLH. Class A are ubiquitously
expressed proteins such as those encoded by the differently
spliced transcripts of E2A (E12, E47, E2-5), E2-2 and HEB
genes [1]. Class B comprises tissue-specific bHLH proteins
that form heterodimers with a partner from the ubiquitously
expressed class A family [2].

by the presence of an Ala-rich motif between residues 39
and 57. It can be hypothesized that Id4 might exert unique
functions through this structural feature. Despite the high
similarity in the HLH domain, the Id proteins bind different targets with different affinities; for example Id2 is the
only Id family member that recognizes the retinoblastoma
protein [4, 5].
Id proteins were described initially as inhibitors of differentiation and more recently as regulators of cell cycle
progression, senescence, apoptosis and tumorigenesis
[6-9]. Id proteins play a critical role in promoting the progression through the S-phase of the cell cycle in cell culture

cells. Id1, Id2 and Id3 have been shown to interact with
cell cycle regulatory molecules [10]. Indeed, they negatively regulate the expression of cyclin D1, p16Ink4a and
p21CIP1/WAF1 [11, 12, 13]. The expression and function of
Id proteins need to be strictly controlled to ensure the correct timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation. The role
of Id2 has been well characterized in this regard. Indeed
Id2 physically interacts with the tumor suppressor protein
Retinoblastoma (pRb). Genetic analyses have shown that
pRb restrains Id2 activity during development to prevent
ectopic proliferation and apoptosis and to promote differentiation. The absence of functional pRb leads to a gain of

Fig. 1. Deregulated Id signaling may promote multiple attributes of malignancy. (A) Increased levels
of Id proteins have been reported in cancer cells and their expression is frequently governed by activated oncogenes (such as Myc and beta-catenin that control Id2 expression). In non transformed cells
Rb restrains Id2 function by direct interaction [4, 5]; during tumorigenesis Id2 protein levels increase
and overcome Rb control resulting in unresctriced proliferation. Id proteins accumulation also leads to
inhibition of the bHLH factors (E-proteins and ETS) responsible for cell cycle exit, differentiation and
senescence [11, 13, 46-50], causing anaplasia. (B) Id1 expression in breast cancer cells is induced
by cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (promoting metastasis) while is repressed by KLF17 (a
metastatic suppressor) [51, 52]. Id1 expression may negatively regulate PTEN, leading to Akt activation,
and drives tumor reinitiation during breast cancer metastasis [53-56]. (C) In endothelial progenitor cells
Id1 and Id3 maintain the expression of FGFR1, MMP2, laminin 5 and alpha 6-beta 4 integrin [57], thereby
enabling the mobilization of EPC from the bone marrow to the site of the tumor in response to circulating
cytokines [17, 18].

Id2 activity and inappropriate sequestration of E proteins,
causing a block in the cell cycle exit and differentiation.
Loss of Id2 partially compensates loss of function of pRb.
This results in the block of differentiation of the nervous
system and hematopoietic compartments [5].
As outlined above, Id proteins are required for proper
development and differentiation. However, the expression
of Id proteins, which is very low in adult tissues, can be
reactivated in human cancers. It has been proposed that
deregulated Id signaling may promote multiple attributes
of malignancy (summarized in Figure 1), like unrestricted
proliferation, loss of differentiation (anaplasia), invasiveness and neoangiogenesis [9, 14]. Elevated levels of Id
proteins have been reported in several malignancies (carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, neural
tumors, melanoma, sarcoma, seminoma and leukemia) [9].
In some cases, high levels are associated with tumor stage/
grade and with prognosis. Analysis of genetic alterations
of Id genes in human tumors has found no mutations. This
may indicate that Id genes are not common oncogenes.
Nevertheless, the overexpression of Id genes in cancer is
frequently governed by bona fide oncogenes, such as MYC
driven Id2 expression in neuroblastoma cells [5, 15] and
beta-catenin driven Id2 expresion in colon cancer cells
[16]. The role of Id proteins in cancer seems to rely on
activity carried out in different cell compartments. Id protein expression is upregulated in the tumor itself, leading
to enhanced cell proliferation and inhibition of senescence
[9]. Genetic studies on Id1 and Id3 knock-out mice have
shown that Ids are expressed in endothelial progenitor cells
(EPC) and are required for EPC mobilization from the bone
marrow during pathological tumor-induced neoangiogenesis [8]. The expression of Ids remains high in tumor neovasculature [17] and drives the “angiogenic switch” required
for the progression from micro- to macro-metastases [18].

for the normal G1/S transition in early cortical progenitors,
the absence of its expression compromises the proliferation
of stem cells in the ventricular zone [21].
It has been established that developmental regulators
play a direct role in driving aspiring cancer cells towards
a malignant phenotype, and contribute to the conferring of
stem-like cell properties, including robust renewal potential
[22]. Enforced Id4 expression can drive malignant transformation of primary murine Ink4a/Arf−/− astrocytes, thereby
highlighting the role of Id4 in controlling the “stemness”
of neural cells during development of the central nervous
system [23]. Id4 increases the levels of both cyclin E (that
leads to a hyperproliferative state) and Jagged1 to drive
astrocytes into a neural stem-like cell state. Id4 mRNA
levels were found to have increased in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) when compared to normal brain
tissue. Interestingly, the analysis of Id4 protein expression
in human GBM specimens evidenced that the majority of
Id4-positive cells resides near the vasculature, a location
postulated to be the niche for brain tumor stem cells [24].
Conversely to that observed in brain tumors, reduced
Id4 expression due to promoter hypermethylation was
observed in gastric and colorectal carcinomas, indicating a
possible role of Id4 in tumor suppression (see Table 1). Id4
promoter was also found hypermethylated in a variety of
other malignancies, such as leukemia, prostate cancer and
breast cancer (summarized in Table 1).
Id4 in breast cancer
The analysis of Id4 expression in breast cancer has lead
to seemingly controversial findings. This might be due to
the scarcity of available information regarding the role
of Id4 in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, each breast cancer
subtype represents a distinct pathology characterized by
specific cytogenetic and molecular alterations, proliferation rate, metastatic potential and response to conventional
anticancer treatments.
In situ hybridization analysis of normal breast epithelium and carcinoma has shown that Id4 is expressed only in
estrogen receptor negative (ER-) tissues [25]. ER-positive
(ER+) cells are negative for Id4 expression both in normal
epithelium and carcinoma. Following these findings a
tumor suppressor role for Id4 in human breast has been
proposed. Analysis of the methylation status of Id4 promoter in breast cancer cell lines and tissues has indicated
that hypermethylation is a frequent event and is associated
with an increased risk of lymph node metastasis [26, 27].
To date the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor
suppressor activity of Id4 have not been characterized.
On the contrary, Beger and colleagues [28] have proposed a
positive role for Id4 in mammary and ovarian tumorigenesis. The modulation of Id4 expression in breast and ovarian
cancer cell lines resulted in inversely regulated expression
of BRCA1. An increase of Id4 expression was associated

Id4 in neural development and cancer
Id4 is the least studied member of the Id family of proteins. Several lines of evidence suggest that Id4 plays an
important role in the nervous system, and in particular in
oligodendrocyte development. Id4 is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and may control the timing of
oligodendrocyte differentiation. Enforced expression of Id4
in vitro stimulates proliferation and blocks differentiation
of oligodendrocyte precursor cells [19]. Id4 was recently
found to directly interact with bHLH, OLIG1 and OLIG2
in neural progenitor cells. It also mediates the inhibitory
effects of bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) on oligodendroglial differentiation that leads to astrocytic differentiation [20]. Studies on knock-out mice revealed that Id4
is required for normal brain size and regulates neural stem
cells proliferation and differentiation [21]. In particular, Id4
regulates lateral expansion of the proliferative zone in the
developing cortex and hippocampus. Since Id4 is required

with the ability of ovarian (PA-1) and breast (SKBr3)
cancer cells to exhibit anchorage-independent growth,
while its depletion determined morphological change to a
large and flat epithelial phenotype. The expression of ID4
and BRCA1/ER inversely correlated in sporadic breast
cancers [29]. Turner et al. [30] have reported that high
expression of Id4 mRNA is present in basal-like breast
cancer (expressing cytokeratines 5/6) when compared to
matched non-basal controls, and Id4 expression correlates
to low levels of BRCA1 mRNA. Additional proof of the
active role of Id4 in breast tumorigenesis has been provided
by Shan et al. [31] who found elevated nuclear expression
of Id4 protein in mammary rat carcinoma compared to
adenoma and normal tissue. Id4 protein nuclear staining in
carcinomas was also positively correlated with proliferation, invasiveness and tumor weight. Enforced Id4 expression caused an increase in colony growth in soft agar [31].

demonstrate that a subset of p53 mutant proteins exert
gain of function activity, thereby actively participating in
tumorigenesis [32]. Mutant p53 has been shown to increase
cellular resistance to anticancer treatments and to contribute to genomic instability by abrogating the mitotic spindle
checkpoint, consequently facilitating the generation of
aneuploid cells [33, 34]. Mutant p53 knock-in mice have
a higher frequency of solid tumours with a high potential
for metastasis, a feature not seen in p53 knock-out animals
[35, 36].
We have recently shown that mutant p53 proteins specifically induce Id4 expression in experimental cell systems [37]. Moreover, Id4 protein expression is enriched in
breast cancer tissues showing p53 overexpression, often
correlated to a mutation in the coding sequence of TP53
gene that confers a high level of stability to the protein.
We found that Id4 is expressed in 44% of the breast cancer
specimens analyzed (186 patients). As already mentioned,
Id4 positivity is increased in the p53 overexpressing population (p53+), where it reaches 60%, compared to the p53negative population (38%); this phenomenon is even more
marked in the HER2 subtype (54 specimens), where Id4 is
expressed in nearly 80% of p53+ cases, compared to 40%
of the p53- cases [37]. HER2 overexpressing breast cancer
subtype presents very high frequency of TP53 mutations,

Id4 and p53 mutations
Half of all human cancers bear TP53 mutations. Most
of the p53 alterations are missense mutations, often within
the conserved DNA binding core domain of the protein.

like also cancers presenting a basal phenotype [38]. The
small number of basal-like tissues examined in our study
did not permit obtaining significant information about the
potential correlations existing between Id4 and p53 expressions in this BC subtype. The interrogation of public gene
expression data repositories (www.oncomine.org) [39] for
Id4 mRNA expression in breast cancers revealed that high
levels of Id4 transcript are present in basal-like versus nonbasal breast cancers in various studies (data not shown). 	
	
Further characterization performed in breast cancer cell
lines enabled us to show that the transcriptional transactivation of Id4 promoter is exerted by the complex mutant
p53/E2F1/p300 [37]. The net biological output of the transcriptional activation of Id4 gene by mutant p53 is the
increase of the angiogenic potential of mutant p53-carrying
tumor cells (see Figure 5). The binding of Id4 protein to
the mRNAs of pro-angiogenic factors like IL8 (CXCL8)
and GRO-alpha (CXCL1), that results in an increased stability and a higher rate of translation of these transcripts,
explains the proangiogenic effects of Id4 transactivation. In
parallel to these findings, obtained in cell lines, the staining
of 110 breast cancers for the CD31 blood vessels marker
OncoTarget, May 2010

revealed higher microvessel density in the Id4-positive
population than that in Id4-negative [37]. Significantly,
the most expressed cytokines in HER2 tumors are IL8 and
GRO-alpha [40], cytokines which are also induced by the
transcriptional axis mutant p53 and Id4.
We hypothesize that Id4 displays tumor suppressor
functions in ER+ breast tumors where it is frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation. However, Id4 displays oncogenic activities in the context of breast cancer
cells expressing mutant p53, which are mainly ER- [41,
42]. Thus, mutant p53-carrying cells express proteins
required for the pro-tumorigenic function of Id4, such as
factors that enable Id4 binding to proangiogenic target
mRNAs. The expression profiling of breast cancer tissues
with known p53 status has revealed that tumors with wildtype or mutated p53 are distinguished by pervasive molecular differences [42]. It is therefore likely that many unique
players are present in mutant p53-carrying tissues.

DNA damage
While studying the dependency of Id4 on mutant p53
52

we sought to investigate whether Id4 expression is modulated by mutant p53 in response to commonly used anticancer drugs, such as adriamycin and cisplatin. The majority
of the mutant p53 target genes so far identified are indeed
modulated in response to anticancer agents, thereby providing a molecular basis for increased chemoresistance of
tumors carrying TP53 mutations. Recent findings by Di
Agostino et al. [43] have shown that mutant p53 transactivates cell cycle regulatory genes in response to treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents, thereby providing molecular-based insights into the aberrant regulation of cell cycle
in tumor cells.
We first analyzed Id4 expression of SKBr3 and MCF7
breast cancer cells, carrying mutant p53R175H and wt-p53,
respectively, and of SW480 (colon) and HT29 (colorectal)
adenocarcinoma cells, carrying mutant p53R273H/P309S
and p53R273H, respectively. SKBr3 (ER-) cells express
high levels of Id4 while MCF7 (ER+) cells display 60-folds
lower Id4 levels than SKBr3 (Fig. 2A). These findings correspond with the previously reported observation that Id4
expression is inversely correlated to ER expression [25].
Id4 expression is rather low in colorectal cancer cells (Fig.
2A). This parallels with Id4 promoter methylation as previously shown by Umetani et al. [27].
Next, we assessed Id4 expression upon cisplatin or

adriamycin treatment. Id4 transcript is strongly induced
upon DNA damage in SW480 and HT29 cells (Fig. 2C-D),
while its induction is less pronounced in SKBr3 cells (Fig.
2B). Id4 expression is not induced in wt-p53 MCF7 breast
cancer cells in response to cisplatin or adryamicin (Fig.
2E).
To verify whether DNA damage-induced Id4 upregulation is dependent on endogenous mutant p53 protein, we
analyzed Id4 mRNA levels in SKBr3 and SW480 cells
stably transfected with a vector carrying sh-p53 interference. Id4 transcript was strongly compromised in the p53silenced cells (Fig. 3A-B). These findings indicate that
Id4 can be transcriptionally modulated by mutant p53 in
response to DNA damaging agents.
To further evaluate the role of mutant p53 on the transcriptional control of Id4 gene expression in response to
DNA damaging agents, we analyzed the in vivo occupancy
of mutant p53 on Id4 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. As previously reported, we observed
the recruitment of p53R175H to the A, C and D regions of
Id4 promoter in untreated SKBr3 cells (Fig. 4A). In agreement with the hypermethylated status of Id4 promoter and
its silenced expression, mutant p53 did not bind any of the
analyzed regions of Id4 promoter in untreated SW480 cells
(Fig. 4C). Upon adriamycin treatment we found that mutant

ID4 expression was performed in SKBr3 (A) and SW480 (B) cells whose p53 expression was
depleted (sh-p53) and control cells (sh-scramble) upon treatment with adriamycin (1μM) for
36h. For p53 interference cells were transfected with pRS-p53-scramble and pRS-p53 plasmids
and transfected cells were selected with puromycin. Mutant p53 protein expression of stably

p53 is recruited only to the D region of Id4 promoter in
both cell lines (Fig. 4A, 4C) and this recruitment parallels
a slight increase in histone H4 acetylation in that region.
Since region D of Id4 promoter contains a CDE consensus
where mutant p53 and E2F1 are concomitantly bound in
proliferating SKBr3 cells [27], we analyzed E2F1 occupancy in that region in response to adriamycin. As shown

in Fig. 4B-D E2F1 is strongly recruited to the region D of
Id4 promoter in both cell lines and its binding is enhanced
in SW480 cells upon adriamycin treatment, thereby suggesting a transcriptional cross-talk between mutant p53 and
E2F1 in the control of Id4 expression in response to DNA
damage.

Fig. 5. Role of mutant p53 and Id4 in breast tumor neoangiogenesis. (A) In proliferating breast cancer cells
carrying mutant p53 the protein complex mutp53/E2F1/p300 assembles on specific regions of Id4 promoter
(NF-kB and CDE elements), and positively controls Id4 expression. The newly synthesized Id4 protein binds to
the 3’UTR of mRNAs encoding pro-angiogenic factors, like IL8 and GRO-alpha, which contain AU-rich elements
(ARE), causing their stabilization and enhancement of translation. This results in an increase of the angiogenic
potential of cancer cells expressing mutant p53. (B) In response to DNA-damaging agents mutant p53 is specifically recruited to the downstream CDE element of Id4 promoter and transactivates its transcription in breast and
colon cancer cells. The increased levels of Id4 protein probably participate to the chemoresistance of mutant
p53-carrying cells.

DISCUSSION

display any binding to Id4 promoter regions in proliferating
cells, while it binds to region D upon treatment with DNAdamaging agents. This suggests that reactivation of Id4 by
mutant p53 in response to DNA damage agents occurs irrespective of the amount of basal Id4 and might share identical molecular events that remain to be identified.
Our data indicate that Id4 plays different roles in cancer
cells carrying mutated p53 proteins. In proliferating cells
Id4 plays a role in the recruitment of new blood vessels,
thereby ensuring the survival and the spreading of tumor
cells. Id4 might also contribute to the chemoresistance of
mutant p53 tumor cells. The amounts of drugs used in the
reported experiments are sub-lethal doses for SKBr3 and
SW480 cells but became highly apoptotic upon depletion
of mutant p53 protein [45].
Future research will be devoted to the identification of
the subsets of target mRNAs that are bound by Id4 in breast
cancer cells presenting wt-p53 (where Id4 is probably antitumorigenic) or mutant p53 (where Id4 is probably protumorigenic).

Id4 expression is upregulated in tumor cells carrying endogenous mutant p53 proteins upon treatment with
diverse anticancer drugs. This induction is dependent on
mutant p53 expression. It has recently been shown that Id1
expression is inhibited by DNA-damaging agents (camptothecin and adriamycin) in a wild-type p53-dependent
manner (wt-p53) [44]. Indeed, wild-type p53 induces the
transcriptional repressor DEC1, which in turn binds to Id1
promoter and represses its transcription. It appears that
the impact of DNA damage on the expression of Id family
members might be closely linked to the status of p53 protein. Further experimental work is needed to decipher the
underlying molecular mechanisms of these events.
We found that mutant p53 is selectively recruited onto the
region D of Id4 promoter in cells treated with DNA damaging agents. These findings indicate that the recruitment of
mutant p53 to Id4 promoter depends on the status of the
cell (proliferating or treated with DNA-damaging agents).
While mutant p53 is recruited to three regions (NF-kB
binding site and two CDE elements) of Id4 promoter in
untreated cells [27], it binds to the downstream CDE consensus (region D) in presence of DNA-damaging agents. In
cells whose Id4 expression is very low or in the presence
of hypermethylation of Id4 promoter, mutant p53 does not
