ABSTRACT
Background/aims: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is ranked as the fourth leading cause
of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite recent advances in treatment options, a
modest impact on the outcome of the disease is observed so far. Short-term fasting
cycles have been shown to potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapy against glioma.
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of fasting cycles on the efficacy of
gemcitabine, a standard treatment for PC patients, in vitro and in an in vivo pancreatic
cancer mouse xenograft model.
Materials and Methods: BxPC-3, MiaPaca-2 and Panc-1 cells were cultured
in standard and fasting mimicking culturing condition to evaluate the effects of
gemcitabine. Pancreatic cancer xenograft mice were subjected to 24h starvation
prior to gemcitabine injection to assess the tumor volume and weight as compared
to mice fed ad libitum.
Results: Fasted pancreatic cancer cells showed increased levels of equilibrative
nucleoside transporter (hENT1), the transporter of gemcitabine across the cell
membrane, and decreased ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) levels as compared
to those cultured in standard medium. Gemcitabine was more effective in inducing
cell death on fasted cells as compared to controls. Consistently, xenograft pancreatic
cancer mice subjected to fasting cycles prior to gemcitabine injection displayed a
decrease of more than 40% in tumor growth.
Conclusion: Fasting cycles enhance gemcitabine effect in vitro and in the in vivo
PC xenograft mouse model. These results suggest that restrictive dietary interventions
could enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments in pancreatic cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

rendering current treatment options ineffective. Up to
80-90% of PC patients are not eligible for resection at
presentation and the available therapeutic strategies
based on conventional chemotherapy are still largely
unsatisfactory considering that less than 5% will survive
up to 5 years [2, 3]. Efforts are needed to find effective
treatment or novel therapeutic approaches to overcome the

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is ranked as the fourth
leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide [1].

aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance of the tumor,

resistance of PC to conventional anticancer therapies. A
standard therapy for treatment of patients with PC with
either curative or palliative intent is gemcitabine [4, 5]. The
latter is a nucleoside analogue (similar to cytosine) with
tumor growth arrest properties due to the two fluorines
on the carbon 2’, instead of the hydrogen atoms, which
render instability in the DNA chain during the replication
process. Gemcitabine is taken up within pancreatic
cancer cells primarily by human equilibrative nucleoside
transporter 1 (hENT1) [6]. After being phosphorylated by
DCK (deoxycytidine kinase) to its active form, it finally
exerts its anti-tumor growth properties. Several studies
analyzed the expression of hENT1 as it was expected to
be predictive for clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer
patients treated with gemcitabine [7, 8]. Another target
of gemcitabine is the human ribonucleotide reductase
(RRM1), a key enzyme involved in the homeostasis of
nucleotide pools affecting cell proliferation, migration
and metastasis [9], which was found to improve survival
in gemcitabine-treated patients displaying lower levels
of RRM1, whereas higher levels did not [10, 11].
Recently, major health benefits associated with dietary
restriction have been demonstrated, such as amelioration
of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, insulin resistance,
immune disorders, slowing of the aging process and
reduced risks of cancer [12]. Recent studies in rodent and
in vitro models uncovered a potential link between short
term starvation and improved efficacy of chemotherapy
for some types of cancer [13, 14]. At present no data

are available on the effect of short term starvation on
pancreatic cancer. Here we sought to investigate whether
fasting is able to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy
in pancreatic cancer cells and in a PC xenograft mouse
model.

RESULTS
Cell viability assay in fasted and non-fasted
pancreatic cancer cells
As a first step we performed a time and dose
response curve in order to establish the effect of
gemcitabine on the viability of three PC cell lines, BxPC3,
Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2. As shown in Figure 1A, 1μM of
gemcitabine slightly reduced cell viability in all the cell
lines and this concentration was used in all subsequent
in vitro experiments. Of note, higher concentrations of
gemcitabine did not affect cell mortality rate, most likely
because higher-dose of gemcitabine treatment enriches
chemotherapy resistant cells as already demonstrated [15].
When gemcitabine and fasting mimicking medium (FMM,
0.5g/L glucose and 1% FBS) treatments were combined,
pancreatic cancer cells displayed the highest death rate
compared to FMM or gemcitabine added to a control
standard medium alone (CM, 2g/L glucose and 10% FBS)
(Figure 1B).

Figure 1: Cell viability assay. BxPC-3, PANC-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells were treated for 24h and 48h with gemcitabine at a concentration
range between 0.5 µM and 2.5 µM A. Cell viability assay was performed on cells growing on control (CM) or fasting mimicking medium
(FMM) after 48h of gemcitabine treatment at a concentration of 1 µM, including untreated cells used as control samples B. Results are
expressed as means ± SE. Differences were considered as significant when P < 0.05 (*) or P < 0.01 (**) or P <0.001 (***).

Fasting inhibits cell migration

Fasting augments hENT1 and decreases RRM1
expression

To investigate the effect of fasting on pancreatic
cancer cell migration, a key event in carcinogenesis, we
performed an in vitro wound-healing assay. Gemcitabine
in combination with FMM significantly reduced cell
migration of BxPC3, PANC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 while
gemcitabine treatment alone failed to do so (Figure
2A-2B). Remarkably, FMM alone was as effective as
combined treatment in inhibiting cell migration (Figure
2A-2B).

To better understand the mechanism through
which fasting was more effective than control media, we
hypothesized that the low glucose level contained in the
fasting medium could be responsible for the activation of
the nucleoside transporter protein (hENT1) as reported
in other studies [17-20], potentiating the gemcitabine
effect in inhibiting RRM1 expression. As shown in
Figure 4A, hENT1 mRNA expression increased upon
exposure of BxPC-3 and MIAPaCa-2 cells to FMM and
FMM plus gemcitabine while no significant changes were
observed in PANC-1 cells. At the protein level, hENT1
increased in all cell lines when subjected to FMM (Figure
4B). Furthermore, FMM and FMM plus gemcitabine
significantly reduced RRM1 mRNA levels in BxPC3 and
Panc-1 cells, but not in MIAPaCa-2 (Figure 4C), whilst
RRM1 protein expression was reduced in all cell lines as
compared to controls (Figure 4D).

Effect of fasting on cell cycle
Cell cycle derangement is one of the main tumor
arrest properties of gemcitabine [16]. We performed a cell
cycle analysis to assess the effect of gemcitabine alone or
in combination with FMM on PC cells as compared to PC
cells cultured in CM. Figure 3 shows that PC cells treated
with gemcitabine in CM condition displayed a slight but
non-significant increase in G0/G1 phase while combined
treatment (fasting plus gemcitabine) significantly
increased the percentage of PC cells in G0/G1 phase, with
decreased S phase (synthesis) and G2/M phase in BxPC3
and PANC-1 cells. Although the percentage of cells in
G0/G1 phase was increased upon combined treatment
in MIAPaCa-2 cells, the latter did not reach statistical
significance.

Fasting increases gemcitabine uptake
In human endothelial cells high glucose leads
to increased synthesis of nitric oxide (eNOS) and
reduced uptake of adenosine-like molecules (such as
gemcitabine) through a reduced expression and activity
of human hENT1 [18] which is thought to be mediated
by the transcription factor hCHOP–C/EBPα complex [18].
According to this model, glucose molecules interfere with

hENT1 transcription through the enhancement of eNOS,
resulting in hCHOP-C/EBPα transcription complex
formation and shuttling to the nucleus (Figure 5B). To
unravel the indirect relationship between fasting and
gemcitabine uptake rates in PC cells we adopted stochastic
modeling. Varying the concentration of glucose from 2g/L
(CM regimen) to 0.5 g/L (FMM regimen) and considering
a concentration of gemcitabine of 1μM, we drew
stochastically the quantitative evolution of gemcitabine

uptake for a maximum of 115 thousands of simulated
units of time. To guarantee solid confidence intervals, we
simulated the modeled system under both diet regimes a
thousand times and monitored the temporal concentration
changes of gemcitabine within the cell. We then verified
that the CM medium contributed to a mean gemcitabine
uptake of 40%, while FMM medium more than doubled
(82.3%) its mean transport rate (Figure 5A).

Fasting potentiates gemcitabine effect in a PC
xenograft mouse model

a longer survival [6, 22-24], we then assessed hENT1
protein expression in pancreatic cancer biopsies of the
nude mice allocated in the four treatment groups. In
Figure 7A it is shown that hENT1 expression was more
prominent in PC mice subjected to combined fasting
and gemcitabine treatment as compared to control mice.
5 out of 6 (83%) mice subjected to 24h of complete
fasting prior to gemcitabine injection (Figure 7A panel h)
displayed positive levels of hENT1 as compared to mice
allocated in gemcitabine (f) and fasting alone (g) groups
(50%). 60% of control mice (panel e) showed negative
hENT1 expression whilst the remaining 40% showed
a weak signal. As for RRM1, an inverse correlation
between RRM1 mRNA and protein levels was found:
tissue samples from pancreatic cancer biopsies of the nude
mice with higher levels of RRM1 mRNA (mice treated
with gemcitabine, fasting or fasting plus gemcitabine
treatment) displayed lower levels of the protein (Figure
7B), suggesting the existence of a post-transcriptional
feedback mechanism within xenograft tumor between
mRNA and protein levels of RRM1. Additionally we

We then evaluated the effects of combined fasting
and gemcitabine treatment in a xenograft pancreatic
cancer mouse model. As shown in Figure 6 mice subjected
to 24h of complete fasting before gemcitabine injection
displayed a significant retarded progression of pancreatic
cancer tumor (p = 0.04). Notably, fasting in the absence
of chemotherapy was as effective as gemcitabine alone,
although this was just below the statistical significance.

hENT1, RRM1, Ki67 and BCL-2 expression in
pancreatic cancer biopsies of mice under fasting
condition
Since a potential prognostic role for hENT1 and
for RRM1 has been postulated [9, 21], and increased
hENT1 levels enhance the response to gemcitabine in
human pancreatic cancer [19] and are associated with

and cell death/apoptosis in pancreatic cancer biopsies
from mice. As reported in Figure 7A, Ki67 positivity was
higher in the control group (panel i) with 60% of mice
displaying the highest positive level for Ki67 while 40%
of mice in the gemcitabine group (panel l) and only 16%
of mice in the fasting group (panel m) were positive for
Ki67 staining. In the fasting plus gemcitabine group, all
mice displayed intermediate levels of Ki67 (panel n). On
the other hand BCL-2 expression was undetectable in all
pancreatic cancer biopsies (panel o, p, q, r).

activity of Akt, whereas significant changes were found
in mTOR activity. In detail, gemcitabine treatment alone
caused a significant increased phosphorylation levels of
mTOR, which was abolished when combined with fasting.
As concerns the downstream effector of mTOR, namely
p70S6K, a trend towards a decrease in activity, without
reaching statistical significance, was observed in all three
groups gemcitabine, fasting, and fasting plus gemcitabine.

DISCUSSION
Over the last four decades only small improvements
in survival have been achieved for patients with pancreatic
cancer, which represents one of the most aggressive
cancers due to its therapeutic resistance [27]. This can be
partly attributed to the ineffectiveness of chemotherapeutic
compounds reaching the cancer cells, as suggested by
previous preclinical and clinical work [28-30]. Dense
stroma [31, 32] and deregulated cellular transport proteins
[7] are considered pathological features constituting
physical barriers to effective drug delivery. In fact, Koay
et al, demonstrated that tumors displaying higher stromal
scores had lower gemcitabine DNA incorporation [28].

Effects of fasting on the mTOR pathway in tumor
samples
The protective effect of fasting may in part be due
to the inhibition of the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway
in normal cells and also in vitro “fasting” and rapamycin
protect normal cells and increase cytotoxicity in cancer
cells [25, 26]. For this reason we investigated Akt and
mTOR activity in pancreatic cancer mice’ biopsies. As
shown in Figure 8, no changes were observed in the

Other studies showed that the gemcitabine transporter
protein hENT1 is associated with the outcome of the
disease [32].
Fasting has been practiced for millennia, but, studies
have only recently shed light on its role in adaptive
cellular responses that reduce oxidative damage and
inflammation, achieving cellular protection [33]. Fasting,
short-term calorie or protein-restricted diets have been
reported to have beneficial effects in mice models of
certain types of cancer [34, 35] accompanied by a decrease
of side effects of chemotherapy in patients [36, 37]. Given
that high glucose levels reduce hENT1 expression and
increase pancreatic cancer cell proliferation [17-20],
we investigated the effect of fasting on gemcitabine
efficacy in vitro and in an in vivo pancreatic cancer mouse
xenograft model.
Our data show that fasting not only increases
hENT1 expression but is also able to increase gemcitabine
uptake, as demonstrated by computational modeling and
stochastic simulation, suggesting that fasting reduces
tumor mass increasing gemcitabine delivery through
hENT1 expression and repressing RRM1 protein.
Moreover, we found that fasting affects mTOR activity,
which plays a major role in maintaining the malignancy

properties of pancreatic cancer stem cells [38]. In tumour
biopsies, mTOR activation increased upon treatment with
gemcitabine and returned to control levels upon fasting.
The increase in mTOR phosphorylation upon gemcitabine
treatment fits with previous finding of mTOR activation
in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cells [39], and the
reversal of this effect in fasting plus gemcitabine combined
treatment may reflect the role of fasting in overcoming
resistance and enhancing gemcitabine efficacy.
Our in vitro results show that FMM inhibits cell
migration and shifts cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase
while fasting cycles inhibit Ki67 in vivo. Our results
are consistent with a recent study showing that calorie
restriction decreases murine and human pancreatic tumor
cell growth [40]. Besides gemcitabine, used alone or in
combination, conventional drugs currently adopted to
treat advanced PC and/or after surgical treatment include
fluorouracil, irinotecan, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin. Notably,
fasting alone tended to reduce tumor mass, which may
represent an alternative for patients who are unable to
undergo these conventional treatments. As for cancer
prevention, no human data are available on the effect of
fasting; however, its effect on IGF-1, insulin, glucose
and ketone body levels could generate a protective

environment that reduces DNA damage and carcinogenesis
while at the same time creating hostile conditions for
tumor and precancerous cells [33]. A strong mental
discipline is needed by the patient to adhere to the fasting
regimen, as underlined by Mathews and Liebenberg
who propose as a potential solution the use of nutrienthaemodialysis to achieve fasting “mechanically” through
dialysis [41]. Based on our in vitro results, in the frame
context of pancreatic cancer, prolonged fasting (more than
24 hours) would be needed in order to achieve an increase
in hENT1 expression to finalize the gemcitabine effect.

for all the fields of each well using Image J.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were harvested at least 3 hours before the
experiment as already described [42]. After fixation with
1ml of 70% cold ethanol at -20°C, as indicated by the
Muse Cell Cycle Kit User’s Guide 200 μl of ethanol-fixed
cells were incubated with propidium iodide and RNAse
A for 30 minutes at room temperature, before loading on
Muse Cell Analyzer (Millipore, Italy) according to the
supplied staining protocol.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Cell culture and fasting mimicking condition

Total RNA was extracted from plated cells using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and subsequently
treated with deoxyribonuclease I, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was
assessed using Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Quantitative
real time PCR for determining the expression levels of
hENT1 was performed on 50 ng of purified RNA using
the one step Quantifast SYBR Green RT PCR KIT
(Qiagen) and the Human SYBR Green QuantiTect Primer
Assay for SLC29A1 (QT000083) purchased from Qiagen.
Reactions were set up in 96-well plates using a 7700HT
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA), and all samples were assayed in triplicate.
Optical data obtained were analyzed using the default and
variable parameters available in the SDS software package
(version 1.9.1; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Expression levels of target gene were normalized using the
housekeeping control gene: TATA binding protein (TBP,
QT00000721). mRNA amount of each target gene relative
to TBP was calculated through the comparative Ct method,
also called the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. Data are presented as the
mean ± SE of at least three independent experiments.

BxPC-3, and PANC-1 cells were cultured either in
control DMEM medium (CM) 2g/L glucose supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Milan, Italy) in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C or in fasting
mimicking medium (FMM) DMEM (0.5g/L glucose and
1%FBS). MIAPaCa-2 were maintained in control RPMI
medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) or in
fasting mimicking condition RPMI medium as described
elsewhere [14].

Cell viability assay
The viability of cells was carried out performing
a Trypan Blue Viability test at 24h and 48h upon
gemcitabine treatment at a concentration range between
0.5 µM and 2.5 µM. The cells were trypsinized and
resuspended in complete medium. Cell suspension was
diluted 1:1 using a 0.4% Trypan Blue solution purchased
by Sigma Aldrich. After one minute of incubation at room
temperature, live and dead cells were counted using an
hemocytometer (Biosigma) and a light microscope (Nikon
Eclipse TS100), than the percentages of viable cell was
calculated as (n° of cell alive/ n° of total cells)x100.

Immunoblotting
Total protein extraction from adherent cells and
from snap frozen pancreatic cancer xenograft specimens
was obtained using homemade Sample Buffer Leammli
2x (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol,
2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% bromophenol blue,
10% glycerol) supplemented with 2x protease inhibitor
cocktail (COMPLETE; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany), 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 1
mM sodium orthovanadate as already described [43] and
through mechanical and detergent based lysis, Ripa buffer
(150 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris HCl pH 7.4, sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) 0,1%, triton 1%, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) 5 mM and 1% cholic acid sodium
salt), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail

Wound healing assay
Cells were seeded into 6-well plate at a density of
approximately 3x105 and were cultured to confluence in
control media for 48h and fasting media for further 24h.
After that two perpendicular scratches were performed
using 10µL filter tips, the media were replaced with
control or Fasting media and the cell were treated with
1µM Gemcitabine. For each well three fields were chosen
by marking with parallel lines on the external side of the
plate. Images were taken for each field at 0h, 24h and 48h
using a Canon Eos 40D. The area of wound was measured

1 mM phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride and 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, respectively. The same amount
of protein extract for each sample was loaded to 9%
SDS- polyacrilammide gel and electroblotted on PVDF
membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) for 60 min at
60V. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary antibody diluted 1:1000 into Blocking Buffer
(1.25% Blotting Grade Biorad, 5% Sodium Azide in
washing buffer) as previously reported [43]. Primary
antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal antibody hENT1
(H-115) (sc-134501), phospho AKT (sc-33437), mouse
monoclonal antibody β-Actin (C4) (sc-47778) from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies against AKT(#9272),
mTOR (#2972), phospho-mTOR (#2974), p70S6K
(#9202), phospho- p70S6K (#9205) and RRM1 (#8637)
were purchased from Cell Signaling. The membranes
were washed three times with washing solution (1x TrisBuffered Saline, 0.1% Tween 20 Sigma) and incubated
for one hour at room temperature with appropriate
secondary antibodies (BioRad, Hercules, CA goat antimouse and goat-antirabbit) diluted 1:3000. Membranes
were washed several times with washing solution prior
to detect the antigen-antibody complexes by enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) with
the signal detected on X-ray film (Amersham Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

chemicals transport and reaction modulation, and species
localization and compartmentalization. The SBGN
model was translated into Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML), a simple and well known XML-based
language, which adds components that reflect the natural
conceptual constructs used by Systems Biology modelers
[44]. Two semi quantitative models were obtained by
adding information about the initial concentrations of
the molecules constituting the two different media of the
cells. These were then temporally simulated by CytoSim: a formal language model and stochastic simulator
of membrane-enclosed biochemical processes [45], in
a computational parallel [46] environment yielding a
thousand trajectories mimicking the Gemcitabine transport
within the cell.

Animal studies
We conducted our mouse work in an AAALAC
(Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care International) accredited
experimental facility. Animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC
approval number is ANM13-001). 5-6 weeks old female
Nu/Nu mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free
(SPF) environment throughout the experiments. BxPC3-luc cancer cells were cultured and s.c. injected into
Nu/Nu nude mice (right flank). A total number of 5×106
tumor cells per mouse was suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS/
matrigel mixture (1:1) and then injected. When tumor
size reached an average volume of 100 mm3, BxPC-3-luc
tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly assigned into 4
groups (6 mice/group) and started dosing immediately.
Group 1 (Normal saline, i.p, qw), group 2 (Gemcitabine,
100 mg/kg, i.p, qw), group 3 (the mice in this group
were fasted 24h before by giving normal saline, i.p, qw),
group 4 (the mice in this group were fasted 24h before
by giving Gemcitabine, 100mg/kg, i.p, qw). For fasting,
mice were single caged and maintained in standard cages
without access to food for 24 hours. Cages were changed
immediately before the initiation of fasting cycle in
order to avoid coprophagy or feeding on residual chow.
Animals had free access to water. Gemcitabine was
dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl w/v in water) to generate
a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. The drug was freshly
dissolved before use, and the solution was homogeneous
before injections. The i.p. injection volume was 100ul/10g
mouse weight.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed by
incubating for 10 minutes at room temperature with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Subsequently cells were incubated for
2 minutes with 0.3% Triton X 100 to permeabilize cells.
The coverslips were washed three times with PhosphateBuffered-Saline solution (PBS) and incubated overnight
at 4°C with the primary antibody rabbit polyclonal
hENT1 (H-115) (sc-134501) diluted in PBS at ratio of
1:50. After three washes with PBS, secondary antibody
incubation was carried out for 1h at room temperature
using rhodamine labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson
Lab) diluted at 1:100. Coverslips were washed again
with PBS three times prior to be mounted on slides using
Vectashield H1-200 (DBA Milan, Italy). A Nikon Eclipse
E600 microscope was used for immunofluorescence
analysis.

Statistical analysis

The hENT1 dynamics, as described in references
[17, 18], was modeled in Systems Biology Graphical
Notation (SBGN). The model focused on the transport
of Gemcitabine within the cells. The key features of
the model were the ability to represent both events like

Results are expressed as mean ± SE. Comparisons
were made using Student’s t-test. Differences were
considered as significant when P < 0.05 (*) or P < 0.01
(**) or P < 0.001 (***).

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pancreatic mice
cancer sections allocated in the four different groups
were immunostained by using commercially available
detection kit (EnVision™ FLEX+, Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) following the manufacturer’s protocol as
previously described [47]. Primary antibody for hENT1
was purchased from Santacruz (cat. no. sc-134501) and
diluted 1:75 while Ki67 (cat. no. M7240) and BCL2
(cat. no. M0887) were from Dako. The specificity of all
reactions was checked replacing the primary antibody with
normal serum alone. Positive and negative controls were
used as appropriate and were run concurrently. hENT1
immunoreactivity was evaluated blindly by an expert
pathologist (PG) assessing a semiquantitative scoring
system in ten high power fields (10HPF, X 400) according
to a semiquantitative scale from negative to 3+ (-: 0%; +:
1-33%; ++: 34-66%; +++: 67-100%).
