BACKGROUND: Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal lesions that can recur repeatedly. When it is feasible, DTs are surgically
resected; however, this often results in high recurrence rates. Recently, treatment with PF-03084014, a potent g-secretase inhibitor,
has been shown to have antitumor activity in several tumor types by affecting the WNT/b-catenin pathway. Consequently, Notch
pathway inhibition by PF-03084014 might be a promising approach for DT treatment. METHODS: The expression of Notch pathway
components was analyzed in DT tissues and cell strains with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. A panel of DT
cell strains was exposed to PF-03084014 and evaluated for cell proliferation. Antitumor effects were assessed via cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration and invasion analysis. Cells treated with PF-03084014 were characterized with a gene array analysis combined
with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that Notch pathway components were expressed at different levels in
DTs. Hes1 (Hes Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) was overexpressed in DT tumors versus dermal scar tissue, and PF-03084014
caused significant decreases in Notch intracellular domain and Hes1 expression in DT cell strains. PF-03084014 decreased DT cell
migration and invasion and also caused cell growth inhibition in DT cell strains, most likely through cell cycle arrest. Gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 2 possibly regulated Notch and
WNT pathways after treatment with PF-03084014 through integrin. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Notch pathway is
an important DT therapeutic target. Furthermore, PF-03084014 has significant antitumor activity against DTs, and it may be an alterC 2015 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf

INTRODUCTION
Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal monoclonal lesions that have a high risk of local recurrence but lack metastatic potential.1 Most DTs (>90%) are sporadic. Their common feature is a deregulated WNT pathway mainly caused
by gain-of-function mutations in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene (encoding for b-catenin), which result in nuclear accumulation of b-catenin.2 DTs can rarely arise in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis due to a germline mutation in
the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which also leads to accumulation of intracellular b-catenin and constitutive
activation of the WNT pathway.3 When it is feasible, DTs are surgically resected. However, because of the lack of metastatic potential, a watch and wait approach may be followed if the lesion is not causing functional difficulty. Systemic therapy, radiation therapy, anti-inflammatory agents, and target therapies may also benefit select patients, but the overall
response to these treatments remains inadequate.4,5 Clearly, there is an ongoing need for more effective DT treatments;
however, this will require improved knowledge of the underlying desmoid pathogenesis.

Notch Inhibition for Desmoid Tumor Treatment/Shang et al

Recent studies suggest crosstalk between the WNT
and Notch pathways.6,7 The Notch pathway is a highly conserved pathway that includes 4 receptors (Notch1, Notch2,
Notch3, and Notch4) and at least 5 ligands (Jagged1,
Jagged2, delta-like 1 [DLL1], DLL3 and DLL4) in mammals.8 With ligand activation, 2 proteolytic cleavages occur
in the Notch receptor, and this results in the release of Notch
intracellular domain (NICD) mediated by c-secretase.
NICD is then translocated to the nucleus and activates transcriptional activators.9 The crosstalk between Notch and
WNT pathways was first observed in Drosophila, in which
Notch is coexpressed with Wingless (the Drosophila homolog of WNT) and regulates Wingless signaling.10 This crosstalk has also been observed in early intestinal precursors and
adenomas11: a high-grade adenoma was converted into a
low-grade adenoma through activation of Notch1 in an Apcmin
mouse colon cancer model.12 Recently, it has been
shown that Notch activity is increased in colorectal cancer
cells through upregulation of Jagged1 mediated by bcatenin, and levels of HES1 messenger RNA are significantly
upregulated in APCmin/1 mouse intestinal cancer models6,13
Moreover, the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 was observed
in mesenchymal stromal cells found in DT samples.14 Together, these results suggest that alterations in one pathway
can potentially affect the other pathway.
The oncogenic potential of the Notch pathway, its
role in cancer development and metastasis, and its association with a poor prognosis for breast cancer, multiple
myeloma, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma have been
reported.15-19 Because the Notch pathway appears to be important to the carcinogenesis of several tumor types, in the
past few years, c-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), by inhibiting
cancer cell Notch signaling through the NICD cleavage
blockade, have emerged as a potential therapeutic treatment. Interestingly, it has been shown that treatment with
the GSI N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) decreases active b-catenin
and activity in various stem, progenitor, and cancer cells
even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, and this suggests that the increase in noncleaved Notch may negatively
regulate active b-catenin.20 Furthermore, recent data show
that the combination of DAPT with extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 inhibitor enhances cell death in gastric
cancer cells through WNT pathway downregulation.21
Recent studies have shown that PF-03084014 may be
a selective and noncompetitive GSI able to inhibit tumor
metastasis and proliferation; it is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial.22-25 PF-03084014 has been shown preclinically to
inhibit the growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cells, most likely through induction of cell cycle arrest and

apoptosis.26,27 In a colorectal cancer explant model, it has
also been shown that PF-03084014 in combination with
irinotecan is more effective than a GSI or irinotecan administered alone. Moreover, in a breast cancer model, PF03084014 demonstrated synergistic effects with docetaxel,
possibly through the induction of early-stage apoptosis.23
Interestingly, Arcaroli et al22 showed that the treatment of a
preclinical colorectal explant model with PF-03084014
resulted in a significant reduction in NICD, Axin2, and
active b-catenin, and PF-03084014 efficacy was prominent
in tumors with high levels of Notch and WNT pathways.
Recently, Messersmith et al24 reported a high response rate
to PF-03084014 for DTs in the first phase 1 trial using this
drug. Because of these promising results, a phase 2 trial is
being conducted in patients with DTs.25 On the basis of
these previous results, we sought to further evaluate the role
of the Notch pathway in DT tissues and cells and also assess
the effects of PF-03084014 on DT cell growth.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell Lines/Strains

All DT cell strains were isolated in our laboratory. This
study was conducted with the approval of the institutional
review board of The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center and with the written informed consent of
patients as previously reported.28 Because the SUP-T1
cell line constitutively expresses Notch, whereas the
U266B cell line is devoid of Notch expression, these cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection for use as positive and negative controls for Notch
expression, respectively. To confirm that our cell strains
were DT cells and not fibroblast cells, CTNNB1 genotyping
of both cell strains and corresponding tumors was performed
(Supporting Table 1 [see online supporting information]).
All DT cells were maintained as previously reported.29
SUP-T1 and U266B were maintained according to the
American Type Culture Collection’s instructions.
Cell-Based Proliferation Assay

Cell growth assays were performed with a CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions to evaluate the
effects of the different doses studied. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm, and the absorbance values
of treated cells are presented as a percentage of the absorbance of untreated cells. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations were calculated with GraphPad Prism software.
Western Blot Analysis

Western blotting was performed with standard methods.
Briefly, 25 to 50 lg of proteins extracted from cultured cells
4089

was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Co). The membranes were blocked with
milk or bovine serum albumin and blotted with relevant
antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass). Nuclear and cytoplasmic
portions were extracted with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A commercially available antibody used for the Western blot analysis
of anti–cleaved Notch1 was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, Mass); anti-Notch1, anti-Jagged1,
b-actin, and secondary antibodies were acquired from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, Calif); and anti-Hes1 was
obtained from Millipore (Billerica, Mass).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction

Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Complementary DNA was generated with the RT III kit
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) and was analyzed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with the LightCycler 480 real-time polymerase chain reaction system
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Relative expression levels
were normalized against b-actin and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA expression.
Quantification of Cell Cycle and Apoptosis
by Flow Cytometry

Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were measured
as previously described.30 DT cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of PF-03084014 for 27 days.
Apoptosis was measured with Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD Biosciences) as previously described.30 As a standard,
DT cells were treated with PF-03084014 for 27 days.
Migration and Invasion Assays

Migration and invasion assays were conducted with modified Boyden chambers as previously described.28
Immunohistochemistry

As previously described, a desmoid tissue microarray was
used to evaluate Hes1, NICD, and Jagged1 protein
expression. Among 195 DT tissue samples, 175 samples
had enough material and were included in the current
study. All 18 scars had enough material and were included
as normal samples. Positive and negative controls were
run in parallel. Immunostaining was scored for both the
intensity ([0] none, [1] low, or [2-3] moderate/high)
4090

and the percentage of cells with positive expression by a
sarcoma pathologist (G.A.A.S.).
Gene Array

For gene array purposes, we used 3 cell strains (Desm14,
Desm27, and Desm39b) that received no treatment (controls; called G-0) or were treated with 10 lM PF-03084014
(called G-10). The regimen for each treatment was 8 and
30 days. We included duplicates for all samples. Samplerelated data can be found in Supporting Table 2 (see online
supporting information). Total RNA was isolated with the
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip arrays
(Illumina, Inc, San Diego, Calif) were used to analyze gene
expression in DT cell strains.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Statistics 19
(IBM, Chicago, Ill). Correlations between tissue microarray biomarkers within scars and desmoids were calculated
with the Pearson correlation. To assess whether the means
of 2 groups were statistically different from each other, we
used the Student t test.
RESULTS
Higher Expression of HES1 Is Observed in
DT Specimens Versus Dermal Scar Tissue
Specimens

To evaluate Notch pathway–related protein expression in
DTs, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of a
previously constructed tissue microarray consisting of 175
DT specimens and 18 scars.2 We analyzed the expression of
NICD, Jagged1, and Hes1. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no anti-Notch1 antibody that works satisfactorily for
immunohistochemistry; therefore, we could not assess
Notch1 expression in our DT tissues. To determine whether
the expression of Notch pathway proteins in DTs is only part
of a physiologic process or is related to carcinogenesis, we
compared DT and dermal scar tissue expression of all analyzed proteins (Fig. 1). Staining scores (percentage and intensity) were assigned by a soft-tissue tumor pathologist
(G.A.A.S.) in a blinded manner for 2 independent staining.
Our results showed no significant difference in NICD and
Jagged1 expression between DT and scar tissues. In contrast,
high expression of nuclear Hes1 was observed in 98.9% of
DT specimens but in only 44.4% of scars (P < .001; Table 1).

protein expression was evaluated. U266B1 served as the
negative control for Notch1, and SUP-T1 is known to generate constitutively high levels of Notch1 and NICD (Fig.
2). In the Western blot analysis, Notch1, Jagged1, and
Hes1 could be observed in all selected DT cells. Our results
for DT cell strains and immunohistochemistry showed that
Notch pathway components were expressed at different levels. In confirmation of our immunohistochemistry results,
Hes1 seemed to be expressed at moderate/high levels in all
DTs, whereas Jagged1 seemed to have lower protein expression levels. This suggests that our DT cell strains are a good
model for investigating the Notch pathway in DTs. Overall, our DT cell strains showed low expression of noncleaved Notch (Notch1); however, NICD was not detected
in any DT cells (data not shown). To investigate whether
DT cells express NICD, the cytosolic and nuclear fractions
of DTs were analyzed separately. As shown in Figure 2, we
could not find NICD expression in the cytosolic fraction of
our DT cell strains; however, we found high expression of
NICD in nuclear fractions, and this suggests that the Notch
pathway is active in DTs.

PF-03084014 Downregulates the Expression of
Notch Pathway Proteins in DT Cells

PF-03084014 is a potent and selective inhibitor of
c-secretase and thereby suppresses the Notch downstream
pathway. To verify that Notch pathway inhibition induced
by PF-03084014 also occurred in our DT cell strains, we
treated 3 different DT cells (Desm2, Desm9, and Desm14)
with this compound for 7 days and examined the expression of proteins related to the Notch pathway. PF03084014 caused significant decreases in NICD and Hes1
expression in a dose-dependent manner in Desm2 and
Desm14 (Fig. 3A), and this confirmed that PF-03084014
is able to inhibit the Notch pathway in DT cell strains.
PF-03084014 Inhibits DT Cell Growth

To further investigate Notch pathway inhibitory effects
on DT cells, we selected 5 DT cell strains to analyze cell
growth after treatment with PF-03084014. Because of the
slow proliferation of DT cells, growth inhibition effects
could be observed only 27 days after PF-03084014 treatment. DT cell treatment with increasing PF-03084014
4091

Original Article

doses (0.01-10 lM) induced significant growth inhibition
(Fig. 3B). The PF-03084014 half maximal effective concentrations were found to be 10.51 lM for Desm2, 20.94
lM for Desm11, 69.91 lM for Desm14, 4.19 lM for
Desm27, and 158.8 lM for Desm51. Among the 5 DT
cell strains, Desm27 was the most sensitive to PF03084014, and Desm51 was the most resistant. Altogether, our results show that PF-03084014 seems to be a
potential growth inhibitor of most DT cells studied.
PF-03084014 Induces Cell Cycle G1 Arrest
to Inhibit DT Cell Growth

To examine whether antiproliferative PF-03084014
effects on DT cell strains were mediated via specific
cell cycle arrest or via induced apoptosis, we performed a
flow cytometry cell cycle and apoptosis analysis of
PF-03084014–treated cells. Our results showed that PF03084014 treatment caused an arrest of cells in the G0-G1
fraction in Desm14 and Desm39b; however, we found
significant G1 arrest only in Desm39b (Fig. 4). We also
observed a reduction in S and G2-M phase fractions;
no significant changes in apoptosis levels were observed
(Supporting Fig. 1 [see online supporting information]).
PF-03084014 Decreases DT Cell Migration
and Invasion

We also examined the potential effect of PF-03084014 on
DT cell migration and invasion. The treatment with 10
lM PF-03084014 for 7 days resulted in decreased cell
migration and invasion in all 5 cell strains analyzed
(P < .05; Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest
that treatment with PF-03084014 may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for DTs.
Wnt1-Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 2
(WISP2) Is Overexpressed After Treatment With
PF-03084014

To further understand the effects of PF-03084014 treatment on DTs, we performed a gene array. Comparing
each treatment with respective controls, we found 139
genes with differential expression (fold change > 1.4) in
any cell strain of the 3 strains studied. Array data were deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (National Center for Biotechnology Information) with accession
number GSE61097. Next, we selected 43 significant
genes (fold change > 1.2) that were expressed differentially in at least 2 cell lines. Among these genes, we selected
WISP2 to be validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Supporting Fig. 2 [see online supporting information]) on the basis of the critical role of this
gene in the WNT pathway. Our results showed that the

treatment with PF-03084014 resulted in overexpression
of WISP2, which is a WNT/b-catenin target gene. This
suggests that WISP2 could also be a link between the
Notch and WNT/b-catenin pathways in DTs.
DISCUSSION
Novel therapeutic strategies possessing improved efficacy
versus DTs are urgently needed to affect the currently
high recurrence rates and treatment-related morbidity.
Several studies have provided evidence of crosstalk
between Notch and WNT/b-catenin pathways.12,20,31-33

Moreover, expression of Notch1 and Hes1 has been
observed in mesenchymal stromal cells within DT samples, and this suggests that the Notch pathway may play
an important role in DT carcinogenesis.14 Similarly to
the latter study, we have shown that the Notch pathway
is highly activated in DT tissues and cell strains. In
accordance with a previous study demonstrating that
HES1 messenger RNA was significantly upregulated in
APCmin/1 mouse intestinal cancer models,13 we also
observed overexpression of Hes1 in DTs versus scars,
and this suggests that the Notch pathway is possibly
related to DT tumorigenesis and may, therefore, be a

useful DT therapeutic target. Recently, several studies
have shown that the Notch pathway appears to be related
to cancer development and metastasis and a poor prognosis for breast cancer, multiple myeloma, pancreatic
cancer, and melanoma.27-32 On the basis of these findings, Notch inhibitors might prove useful as potential
DT therapies. Although Notch inhibition has been
investigated in several malignancies and has shown
potential therapeutic impact, not much is known about
its effect on mesenchymal-origin tumors. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the
effect of Notch pathway blockade in DTs.

Inhibition of Notch signaling through the NICD
cleavage blockade has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for cancer cells because the Notch pathway
seems to be important to the carcinogenesis of several tumor types. Studies have shown that GSIs have the ability
4094

to inhibit the Notch pathway. Significantly, GSIs have
been widely used to inhibit the Notch pathway. However,
they can also potently inhibit active b-catenin, as observed
by Kwon et al,20 who showed that an increase in
noncleaved Notch due to GSI DAPT treatment may

negatively regulate active b-catenin. Recently, a new GSI,
PF-03084014, has been developed and has been shown
to be a selective and noncompetitive GSI with the potential to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis.
PF-03084014 is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial evaluation22,27,34 and has already demonstrated antitumor activity in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia preclinical
studies,26,27 in colorectal cancer explant models (in combination with irinotecan),35 and in a breast cancer model
in combination with docetaxel.23 Taken together, these
data support studying the effects of PF-03084014 treatment in DT tumorigenesis.
In keeping with previous studies, our results showed
that PF-03084014 also inhibits the Notch pathway in
DTs, chiefly by inhibiting NICD and Hes1 expression.
Moreover, our results demonstrate that the Notch pathway blockade contributes to the inhibition of DT cell
growth. However, the anti-DT effects resulting from
Notch blockade appear to reflect growth arrest rather than
apoptotic cell death. These effects are in accord with the
response to PF-03084014 reported in previous studies.26,27 Because Hes1 has been reported to play a role in
cell survival by preventing apoptosis,36 this absence in our
cell strains could be due to the lack of complete inhibition
of Hes1 as this protein can also be induced by b-catenin.35
We also showed that treatment with PF-03084014
reduced DT migration and invasion, and this supports
PF-03084014 as a potential DT therapeutic strategy.
Therefore, biopsies from a phase 2 clinical trial of
PF-03084014 will be of the utmost importance for
addressing the biological effects of this drug.
Molecular characterization of the mechanism of PF03084014 inhibition via gene expression studies has
revealed that the known WNT/b-catenin target gene
WISP2 is upregulated in tumors after PF-03084014 treatment. Recent studies have shown a role for downregulated
WISP2 in the carcinogenesis of several tumor types,
including colorectal cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and salivary gland tumors,37-40
and this suggests that WISP2 may act as a tumor suppressor. We sought to further investigate the role of WISP2 in
the DT PF-03084014 response; therefore, we combined
the analysis of our gene array data with Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (Ingenuity Systems). The analysis demonstrated
that WISP2 can regulate integrin, which, in turn, reportedly induces the Notch and WNT pathway (Supporting
Fig. 3 [see online supporting information]). Taken together, our results suggest that the DT antitumor effects
of PF-03084014 may also be related to an overexpression
of WISP2 and thereby enhance WNT/b-catenin pathway
Cancer

November 15, 2015

regulation; however, additional studies are necessary to
confirm the role of WISP2 in the DT response to GSIs.
In summary, we have shown that the Notch pathway
is activated in DTs and that its inhibition, induced by
PF-03084014, results in significant antitumor activity
against human DTs in vitro. Our findings also suggest
that the crosstalk between Notch and WNT pathways in
DTs seems to occur via Hes1 and WISP2. Moreover, our
results support investigating PF-03084014 as a promising
therapeutic DT approach.
