ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer,
which is the leading cancer killer in the world. Despite the recent advances in its
diagnosis and therapy, the prognosis of NSCLC patients remains very poor, mainly
due to the development of drug resistance and metastasis. Both the chemokine
network and the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system play important roles in
cancer cell metastasis. The disruption of CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling has been
shown to suppress cancer cellviability and metastasis. CCL2-neutralizing antibodies,
which have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in several cancer models, are
not widely used due to technical issues. CCR2 antagonism has thus become an
alternative method for cancer treatment. However, the effect of CCR2 antagonists
on NSCLC progression remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect
of CCR2 antagonist (CAS445479-97-0) on the proliferation, migration and invasion
of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells by using WST-1 cell viability assay,
transwell migration assay, wound healing scratch assay and Matrigel invasion assay.
We demonstrated that CCL2 treatment promoted A549 cell viability, motility and
invasion by upregulating MMP-9 expression and that this induction was significantly
suppressed by CAS 445479-97-0. Taken together, our data suggested that the CCR2
antagonist would be a potential drug for treating CCR2-positive NSCLC patients.

recent advances in therapy, probably due to the development
of locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of
diagnosis [3]. Currently, the main therapeutic strategies for
advanced and metastatic NSCLC are chemotherapy and
specific mutagenic inhibitors for epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK),
c-met and Kras [4]. However, specific mutagenic inhibitors
are only suitable for the rare mutagenic cases [5], and most
cases of NSCLC rapidly develop acquired resistance to

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most
common type of lung cancer, which is the leading cancer
killer in the world [1, 2]. NSCLC patients can be generally
classified into three stages: early (non-metastatic), locally
advanced (confined to the thoracic cavity) and distant
metastasis (outside of the thoracic cavity). Unfortunately, the
prognosis of NSCLC patients remains very poor, despite the

chemotherapy [6]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new
therapeutic approaches for NSCLC patients.
Chemokines are a superfamily of small, soluble
and secreted proteins. Chemokines and their receptors
play roles in numerous physiological and pathological
processes, including cancer development. A growing body
of evidence shows that they coordinate the survival and
metastasis of cancer cells [7, 8]. To date, approximately 50
human chemokines have been identified, and Chemokine
(C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as Monocyte
Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), is a member of the CC
chemokine subfamily. CCL2 was purified and cloned in
1989 from human gliomas and myelomonocytic cells
by two independent research groups and was found to
participate in recruiting and activating monocytes during
acute inflammation and angiogenesis [9–11]. CCL2 is
produced by endothelial cells and fibroblasts [12] and
by a variety of activating cells, such as lymphocytes
and macrophages [9]. Recent studies have reported that
CCL2 is overexpressed in a majority of solid cancer
types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, esophageal
carcinoma, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer
[8, 13–17] and NSCLC [18].
CC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2) was mainly
activated to the sites of inflammation by CCL2 in various
cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic
cells, and memory T cells [19–21]. Recently, we reported
that CCR2 transduced tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T
cell trafficking by CCL2 expression in lung cancer cells,
which potentiated its in vivo anti-lung cancer reactivity
[22]. CCR2 is expressed by a variety of tumor cell types
[23]. The altered expression of CCL2 and CCR2 was
found in NSCLC cells and was correlated with sex,
smoking habits, histology and tumor size. In patients with
NSCLC, positive CCL2 expression was observed more
frequently in men than in women, in never-smokers than
in smokers, in adenocarcinoma than in other histological
types, and in smaller tumors among the patients with
NSCLC. However, there was no relationship of tumor
CCR2 expression with gender, smoking habits, histologic
type of tumor and tumor size [18, 24]. However, its roles
in NSCLC development remain unclear. Because CCL2 is
a chemokine with a wide range of features, the blockade
of CCL2 may have unwanted defects. For example, CCL2
blockade may target CCL2-dependent leukocyte adhesion
and activate the endothelial and transendothelial migration
of leukocytes at sites of inflammation [25]. Recent studies
have indicated that CCR2, but not CCL2, regulates CCL2induced breast cancer cell survival and motility through
MAPK- and Smad3-dependent mechanisms [8].
In contrast, metastatic cancer cells that are distant
from the primary tumor must first cross the basement
membrane (BM), which is a network of extracellular
matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play
an important role in cancer cell metastasis, as particularly
observed for the roles MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the
degradation of ECM [26, 27]. A recent study showed that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

crosstalk between the MMP system and the chemokine
network plays a role in cancer cell metastasis. Both
the chemokine system and MMPs are currently being
evaluated as targets in anti-cancer therapy and may have
potential therapeutic implications [28].
In this study, we examined the expression of CCL2
and its receptor CCR2 in various human NSCLC cell lines
and investigated the effect of the CCL2/CCR2 interaction in
A549 cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. We
demonstrated that CCL2 promoted A549 cell proliferation,
migration and invasion by upregulating MMP-9 expression
and that CCR2 antagonist treatment can inhibit CCL2mediated A549 cell viability, motility and invasion by
downregulating MMP-9 expression. Our data indicated that
targeting CCR2 with an antagonist would be an attractive
strategy to ameliorate cancer cell viability, motility and
invasion in CCR2-positive NSCLC patients.

RESULTS
The expression of CCL2 and its receptor CCR2
in human NSCLC cell lines
We first examined the protein expression level of
CCL2 in the culture media of different human NSCLC
cell lines, including LC99A, LC11-18, NCI-H460 and
A549. CCL2 expression was detected in the media of
LC11-18, NCI-H460 and A549. As shown in Figure 1A,
A549 secreted the highest amount of CCL2 among all of
the examined NSCLC cell lines. We further compared the
mRNA and protein levels of the CCL2 receptor, CCR2,
between A549 and NCI-H460, both of which secreted
high levels of CCL2 into the culture media. The RT-PCR
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1) and Western
blotting (Figure 1C) results suggested a much greater
degree of CCR2 expression in A549 cells, whereas in
NCI-H460, the level of CCR2 was undetectable.

CCL2 promoted A549 cell proliferation,
migration and invasion in vitro
To determine whether CCL2 is a regulator of A549 cell
proliferation, cells were treated with different concentrations
of rhCCL2 (0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml) and examined
for cell viability using WST-1 assay. We found that rhCCL2
was able to increase the cell proliferation and that this effect
became saturated at 50 ng/ml (Figure 2A), partially due to
the high background level of CCL2 secreted by A549 itself.
To test whether CCL2 is a regulator of A549 cell migration,
we tested the effect of a serial dilution of rhCCL2 on A549
cell migration using a cell monolayer transwell experiment
[22] and wound healing scratch assay. The number of CCL2mediated migrated A549 cells increased markedly in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3A). In addition, CCL2 increased
the wound healing migration activity of A549 cells in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). We further utilized a
Matrigel invasion assay to test whether CCL2 is a regulator

of A549 cell invasion. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, the
number of CCL2-mediated invaded A549 cells increased
significantly.
Moreover, to determine whether CCR2 is essential for
the CCL2-mediated viability and motility of NSCLC cells.
The NCI-H460 cells, which expressed undetectable CCR2
(Figure 1B and 1C and Supplementary Figure 1), were also
examined. However, no significant changes was observed in
proliferation and migration of NCI-H460 cells, regardless of
the presence or absence of CCL2 (Supplementary Figures
2–3), which suggests that CCL2 mediates its major effects
through its receptor CCR2 in NCI-H460 cells.
The disruption of CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling
has been shown to suppress cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion. Since CCL2 is a chemokine with
a wide range of features, the blockade of CCL2 may have
unwanted defects. Therefore, further experiments were
performed to verify whether CCR2 antagonism inhibited
CCL2-mediated A549 cell proliferation, migration and
invasion in vitro.

manner. As shown in Figure 3C and 3D, CAS 44547997-0 largely abrogated CCL2-mediated migration in A549
cells. In addition, CAS 445479-97-0 reduced the CCL2induced wound healing activity in A549 cells (Figure
3B). As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, whereas rhCCL2
increased cell invasion by 4.2-fold, pretreatment with
CAS 445479-97-0 decreased rhCCL2-mediated A549 cells
invasion to 51.6±16.0%. Together, our results suggested
that CCR2 antagonist inhibited CCL2-mediated A549 cell
proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.

CCL2 promoted A549 cell migration and
invasion via the upregulation of MMP-9
expression
Previous studies have shown that MMPs play an
important role in cancer cell metastasis, with significant
expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A549 cells [29].
Therefore, we examined whether the MMPs involved in
CCL2-mediated A549 cell migration and invasion. After
treatment with CCL2 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, the mRNA
expression of MMP-1, -2, -3 and -9 was examined by qRTPCR. The results showed that the mRNA expression of
MMP-2, -3 and -9 was increased but that only the mRNA
expression of MMP-9 was significantly increased (Figure
5A). Further increases in the protein levels of MMP-9 in
A549 cells after 24 h of treatment with CCL2 (100 ng/
ml) were examined by Western blot (Figure 5B). Since our

DISCUSSION

previous experiments demonstrated that CCL2 treatment
promoted A549 cell migration and invasion activity
and that the protein level of CCL2-mediated MMP9 increased in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5B),
further experiments were performed to verify whether
CCL2-mediated A549 cell migration and invasion were
regulated by MMP-9. As shown in Figure 6B and 6C, after
the downregulation of MMP-9 expression with MMP-9
inhibitor I (sc-311437, 5 μM) for 30 min, the number of
CCL2-mediated that migrated into and invaded A549
cells decreased significantly. Taken together, our results
suggested that the upregulation of MMP-9 expression
played an important role in CCL2-mediated A549 cell
migration and invasion in vitro.

Increasing evidence points to the vital effects of
CCL2/CCR2 on the proliferative and metastatic properties
of cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 4) [7, 8, 11]. The
current study investigated the anti-proliferative, antimotile and anti-invasive activities of an antagonist against
CCR2, CAS 445479-97-0, by blocking the CCL2/CCR2
axis interaction and downregulating MMP-9 protein
expression in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in
vitro. Here, we found the following: first, CCL2/CCR2
interaction promoted A549 cell proliferation, migration
and invasion, although to a lesser extent compared with
those in other cancer cells, such as prostate and breast
cancer cells [30, 31], which was indicative of tissuespecific functions for CCL2 signaling. Second, in vitro
CCL2-mediated A549 cell proliferation, migration and
invasion by upregulating MMP-9 expression could be
suppressed by CCR2 antagonist. Third, the upregulation
of MMP-9 protein expression played an important role in
CCL2-induced A549 cell motility and invasion in vitro.
The disruption of CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling
has been shown to suppress cancer cell viability and
metastasis. By targeting CCL2 directly, neutralizing
antibodies rather than antagonists are usually used. CCL2
neutralizing antibodies, which have shown promising
therapeutic efficacy in several cancer models [16, 32].
However, the production and storage for antibodies will be
challenging and costly than chemical antagonists. Besides
the limitation on the cost, CCL2 antibodies have shown

CCR2 antagonist inhibited CCL2-mediated A549
cells migration and invasion by downregulating
MMP-9 expression
As shown in Figure 6A, the protein level of CCL2induced MMP-9 was reduced by pretreatment with CCR2
antagonist (CAS 445479-97-0, 10 nM, 24 h) or MMP9 inhibitor I (sc-311437, 5 μM, 30 min). As expected,
pretreatment with CAS 445479-97-0 (10 nM, 24 h)
inhibited CCL2-mediated A549 cell migration by 58%
and invasion by 30% (Figure 6B and 6C). Taken together,
our results suggested that CCR2 antagonist inhibited
CCL2-mediated A549 cell migration and invasion by
downregulating MMP-9 expression through the CCR2
receptor in vitro.

some limitation for cancer treatment, as the removal
of anti-CCL2 antibody in cancer treatment was found
leading to an increased metastatic burden in an orthotropic
mammary tumor model [33], While the cessation of CCR2
antagonist (RDC018, GlaxoSmithKline) did not enhance
malignant progression in hepatocellular carcinoma
postsurgical recurrence mice models. Moreover, animals
receiving CCR2 antagonist have a much longer survival
rate [34].
Based on this knowledge, we focused on CCR2 and
investigated the effects of an antagonist CAS 445479-97-0

against CCR2 on the proliferation, migration and invasion
of A549 cells in vitro. CCR2 antagonist, CAS 44547997-0, is a cell-permeable cis-diamidocyclohexyl urea
compound with high affinity binding to Thr292, which is
adjacent to the key receptor residue Glu291. Herein, we
examined the potential use of the CCR2-specific small
molecule inhibitor (CAS 445479-97-0) in cancer therapy.
Our results suggested that the blockade of the CCR2
pathway inhibited the viability, motility and invasion of
CCR2-positive human A549 lung cancer cells in vitro.
Furthermore, we found that the in vitro use of CCR2

antagonist or MMP-9 inhibitor could suppress the CCL2induced upregulation of MMP-9 expression and reduce the
migration and invasion of A549 cells in vitro.
It is well known that MMPs play a crucial role in the
invasion, migration and angiogenesis of cancer cells and
that MMP-9 is a major factor in cancer cell migration and
invasion [35]. Our data indicated that treating A549 cells
with CCR2 antagonist downregulated CCL2-enhanced
MMP-9 protein expression and significantly reduced
CCL2-induced cell migration and invasion in vitro.
Therefore, MMP-9, as one of the mediators of the CCL2/
CCR2 axis interaction, may cause the inhibition of cancer
cell migration and invasion. The ERK1/ERK2 signaling
pathway has been indicated in CCL2/CCR2-induced
metastasis MMP-9 expression. Firstly, the association
between CCL2/CCR2 axis and the MAPK pathways
has been found in cervical cancer, breast cancer, colon
carcinoma and melanoma cells [8, 14, 36]. Secondly, the
expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 can also be regulated
by ERK1/2 in cancer cells [37, 38]. Lastly, the direct link
of MMP-9 regulation to CCL2/CCR2 axis was proved to
involve the activation of Ras, Raf-1, MEK, ERK, and NFκB pathway [39]. A recent study also found that CCL2CCR2 axis promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis
by activating ERK1/2-MMP2/9 pathway [40]. However,
the detailed signaling transduction pathways through
which CCL2/CCR2 regulates MMP-9 expression in A549
cells remain unknown. Interestingly, the blockade of the
MMP-9 inhibitor I (sc-311437) reduced CCL2-mediated

MMP-9 expression via an unidentified mechanism. In line
with our results, a recent study by Shi et al. found that
PinX1 inhibited NF-kB mediated MMP-9 expression, and
that MMP-9 inhibitor I, sc-311437, brought down MMP9 expression when PinX1 expression was suppressed
[41]. It is likely that sc-311437 affect MMP-9 expression
via an unknown mechanism, which involved NF-κB
activity. Our data demonstrated that CCR2 blockade by
its antagonist downregulated MMP-9 protein expression.
In addition, blockade via the MMP-9 inhibitor reduced
CCL2-mediated cell migration and invasion. Therefore,
MMP-9 may be one of the mediators of the CCL2/CCR2
axis. Here, we proposed a new possible mechanism for
CCL2-induced A549 cell migration and invasion in vitro
via the upregulation of MMP-9 expression.
Moreover, CCR2 was expressed in multiple
immunosuppressive cells, such as CD4+FOXP3+
CCR2+ Treg cells [49], CCR2-expressing myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs), which were recruited to the tumor
site through the expression of CCR2 and play a critical role
in tumor escape [50, 51]. Therefore, the blockade of CCR2
may decrease the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells
to the tumor microenvironment and thereby prevent tumor
progression.
As stated above, the tumorigenic features of
CCL2/CCR2 signaling were described, but CCL2/
CCR2 signaling also plays a protective role in antitumor
effects, such as through the recruitment of type 1

Figure 6: CCR2 antagonist inhibited CCL2-mediated A549 cell migration and invasion via downregulating MMP-9

for 30 min, followed by stimulation with CCL2 for 24 h. The protein level of MMP-9 was then detected by Western blot (A), the migration
and invasion activity of A549 cells were assessed by transwell (B) and Matrigel assays (C), respectively. *p < 0.05 represents statistically

cytotoxic gammadelta T lymphocytes to the tumor
microenvironment [36]. Therefore, the CCL2/CCR2
reaction may have dual context-dependent effects in
tumorigenesis: promoting the metastasis of tumors and
providing anti-tumor effects at the same time. Further
clarification is required to understand the targeting of the
CCL2/CCR2 pathway in cancer therapy.
Previous studies have found that targeting the
chemokine receptor could inhibit cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion [32, 42, 43]. Our study also
demonstrated that CCR2 antagonist suppressed the
CCL2-mediated viability, motility and invasion of the
NSCLC cell line A549 in vitro by downregulating MMP9 expression. Therefore, the CCR2 antagonist may be a
potential novel therapeutic option in the treatment of
CCR2-positive NSCLC.

basement membrane was used to denote the invasion
ability of the cells.

Migration assay

ELISA

The migration assay was conducted via transwell
experiments. In brief, 2X105 A549 cells were placed in
the upper well of a 3-mm pore-size 24-well transwell
plate (Corning Incorporation, Corning, NY, USA). 500 ul
of RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS culture medium containing
a serial dilution of CCL2 was added to the bottom well.
After four hours of incubation, the cells in the bottom well
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, stained
using hematoxylin andcounted under a microscope.
A blocking experiment was conducted using a CCR2
antagonist, CAS 445479-97-0 (10 nM), which was added
to the cells before the cells were placed in the upper
compartment.

CCL2 in the culture supernatant was measured using
an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
1X105 cells were incubated in 24 well plates for 24 hours.
Conditioned media generated from the indicated cell lines
were analyzed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The reaction was stopped with 1M HCl, and absorbance
was read at 450 nm using a BioTek microplate reader (EL309, Vermont, USA).

Statistical analysis
All the experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Two-tailed paired Student's t-test was performed to find
the significance between two groups. Values of p< 0.05
were considered to represent statistically significant
differences.

Wound healing scratch assay
The wound healing scratch assay was used to
evaluate the migration of A549 cells with or without
CCL2 and anti-CCR-2 in vitro. A549 cells were seeded
in six-well plates at a density of 1×106 per well with
complete medium. When cell confluency reaches 100%,
the monolayers were starved overnight in RPMI1640
without newborn bovine serums, then an artificial scratch
wound was created using a p10 pipet tip. The wells were
washed with PBS to remove cell debris and replaced
with fresh RPMI1640 containing variable concentration
of CCL2 and monitored. For blocking assays, the scratch
wound was created after 2 h of the CCR2 antagonist (CAS
445479-97-0) (20 μg/ml) pretreatment. Cell migration was
photographed and the width of the wound was measured.

Invasion assay
Ability of cell invasion was evaluated by the Cultrex
24-well Transwell BME cell invasion assay (Trevigen
Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Briefly, a 24-well unit
with 8-mm polycarbonate nucleopore filters (Corning)
was evenly coated with 100ul of basement membrane
extract coating solution at 37°C for 4 h. 2X105 A549
cells in serum free medium were placed in the upper
compartment. RPMI 1640 medium supplied with 0.5%
FBS with 100 ng/ml of rhCCL2 was added to the lower
compartment. After 24 hours incubation, cells that had
not invaded were removed with a cotton swab. Cells that
had invaded to the lower surface of the membrane were
fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with crystal
