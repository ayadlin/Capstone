BACKGROUND. Bisphosphonates have been used to treat bone metastases in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), but certain agents have been associated
with renal toxicity. For this observational study, the authors assessed the risk of
renal impairment in patients with HRPC who received zoledronic acid from December 1999 to April 2005.

METHODS. A comprehensive medical records review was performed in a major
tertiary oncology center (n ¼ 122 patients). The primary outcome of renal
impairment was defined as an increase 0.5 mg/dL or 1.0 mg/dL over baseline
creatinine value if the baseline value was <1.4 mg/dL or 1.4 mg/dL, respectively. A risk factor analysis was conducted using the Andersen-Gill extension to
the Cox proportional hazards model.

ore than 80% of patients with hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC) eventually develop metastatic bone disease.1
Serious skeletal-related complications from bone metastases, such
as bone pain and pathologic fractures,2 are common and cause significant morbidity and mortality.3
Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate that has
demonstrated efficacy in patients with HRPC who have evidence of
bone metastases.4,5 However, treatment with zoledronic acid is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, which has resulted in recent
changes to its prescribing information. In the United States and the
European Union, the product label for zoledronic acid was updated
to include additional warnings of nephrotoxicity and restrictions for
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment.6,7 The recommended dosage of zoledronic acid for bone metastases is 4 mg IV
over at least 15 minutes repeated every 3 or 4 weeks.6 Nevertheless,

because of renal toxicity issues, the dose of zoledronic acid should be adjusted in patients with mild or
moderate renal impairment (patients with a creatinine clearance 30 mL per minute). The standard 4mg dose should be given only to patients with a creatinine clearance >60 mL per minute. The patients
who are at greatest risk from renal deterioration, as
may be expected, include those with advancing or
progressive cancer, those who are receiving other
potentially nephrotoxic drugs (eg, chemotherapy),
and those with renal-related comorbidities (ie,
chronic renal failure, hypertension, or diabetes).8
Several studies have suggested that the effect of zoledronic acid on renal deterioration may be greater
among elderly patients,9 patients who received pamidronate prior to zoledronic acid,10,11 and patients
with prior renal impairment,12 but none of those studies focused on the HRPC population.
In the pivotal Phase III trial of IV zoledronic acid
in 643 patients with HRPC and bone metastases, renal function deterioration occurred in 15.2% of
patients who received 4 mg zoledronic acid and in
11.5% of patients who received placebo every 3
weeks for 15 months.4 Kaplan-Meier estimates of the
risk of renal function deterioration revealed a relative
risk ratio of 1.07 (zoledronic acid 4 mg vs placebo;
P ¼ .882). In a 2-year update of that trial, renal function deterioration occurred in 16 of 92 patients
(17.4%) who received zoledronic acid and in 10 of 78
patients (12.8%) who received placebo.6 In contrast,
a small observational study by Johnson and colleagues suggested that there may be a higher incidence
of renal deterioration than reported in clinical trials
with zoledronic acid; in that study, the incidence of
renal toxicity associated with zoledronic acid was
27.0% in 15 patients with prostate cancer.13
The current analysis is the first observational
study to our knowledge that quantifies the rate of renal impairment and identifies the associated risk factors in patients with HRPC who received zoledronic
acid for bone metastases in an active, tertiary care
clinical practice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
A comprehensive medical records review was performed using a prospective electronic medical database implemented at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI) and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) (both located in Boston). The Prostate
Cancer Clinical Research Information System was
used to collect, store, and access comprehensive clinical, treatment, and outcomes data on patients with

1091

prostate cancer who were treated at the DFCI and
BWH. Legacy information systems also were queried
to determine dispensed drugs in the DFCI outpatient
pharmacy, laboratory data across 2 hospitals, and
registration data. Information on comorbid diagnoses
and oral or outpatient medications was not stored in
the system and required a medical records review.
Results of creatinine tests that were conducted outside of either center were obtained through patients’
community physicians and laboratories. All patients
provided written informed consent to participate in
this clinical research study. This retrospective study
was approved by the DFCI Institutional Review
Board.

Study Design
This was a single-arm, observational follow-up study
of patients who had HRPC with bone metastases and
were treated with zoledronic acid at the DFCI.
Patients were included in the study if they were aged
18 years, if they were treated actively at the DFCI,
if they had HRPC with bone metastases, if they
received 1 zoledronic acid infusion in the period
from December 1999 to April 2005, and if they had
1 creatinine reading before and after the first zoledronic acid infusion. The observation period began
on the date of the first zoledronic acid infusion and
ended on the last center visit date, the last creatinine
test date, or the defined study end date (April 30,
2005), whichever occurred later. The treatment period spanned from the first infusion to the last infusion of zoledronic acid.
Outcome definition
The primary endpoint of renal impairment was
defined as the proportion of patients with any of the
following abnormal serum creatinine elevations: an
increase 0.5 mg/dL over the baseline serum creatinine value (defined as the last creatinine serum test
prior to beginning zoledronic acid treatment) if the
baseline value was <1.4 mg/dL or an increase 1.0
mg/dL over the baseline serum creatinine value if
the baseline value was 1.4 mg/dL. Two secondary
endpoints of renal impairment were used. The first
was defined based on creatinine clearance and was
calculated by using the Cockcroft-Gault formula,14
which converts the serum creatinine level to creatinine clearance by factoring in patient sex, age, and
weight. Creatinine clearance may be a more sensitive
measure than serum creatinine level, because it considers patient-specific factors. Renal impairment was
defined as a decrease 25% in creatinine clearance
from the baseline value. For the secondary endpoint
of renal impairment, patients were graded according

1092

CANCER

to serum creatinine levels: grade 1, from the upper
limit of normal to 1.5 times the baseline serum creatinine value; grade 2, from 1.5 to 3 times the baseline
serum creatinine value; grade 3, from 3.1 to 6 times
the baseline serum creatinine value; and grade 4, >6
times the baseline serum creatinine value. If the
patient experienced different grades over the course
of observation, then the most severe grade was
designated for the patient.

Covariate definition
The following covariates were considered in the riskfactor analysis: demographics (age and race), comorbidities (eg, history of hypertension, congestive heart
failure, diabetes, prior renal disease, hyperlipidemia,
and recent surgery), medications associated with
acute renal failure15 (eg, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants), treatment with chemotherapy and secondline hormone therapy, and prior use of other bisphosphonates.
Statistical Analyses
The risk of renal toxicity was calculated as the proportion of patients who experienced renal impairment. The risk-factor analysis was conducted using
the Cox proportional hazards model for time-related
binary outcome data and the Andersen-Gill multipleevent analysis,16 which is an extension to the Cox
model. The Andersen-Gill regression models the recurrence of renal impairment outcomes as well as
the time to first renal impairment, taking into consideration how persistent the problem has been. In
this model, each patient is treated as a multievent
counting process. In both models, patients who did
not experience any renal impairment during their
observation periods were included in the analysis as
censored observations. Collinearity among covariates
was examined and significant risk factors associated
with the primary endpoint of renal impairment were
identified through the stepwise selection procedure
at P < .05.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Medical records data from a total of 135 patients
were collected, and 13 of those patients were
excluded from the analysis (10 patients had no baseline creatinine test, and 3 patients had no postzoledronic acid creatinine test). Baseline demographics
and characteristics for the 122 evaluable patients are
shown in Table 1. The median observation period
was 11.7 months. The median patient age at the time

patients (33%) died during treatment of progressive
prostate cancer. Three patients (4.2%) stopped secondary to bone pain attributed to zoledronic acid,
and 30 patients (41.7%) stopped for various other
reasons, including the end of tumor-related pain,
transfer to an assisted-living facility or hospice care,
and switch to treatment with pamidronate. Fifteen
patients (20.8%) discontinued zoledronic acid because

Renal Impairment Rates
Twenty-nine of 122 patients (23.8%) experienced 1
renal impairment event during treatment based on
serum creatinine elevations (average, 3 events per
patient; range, 1–12 events per patient) (Table 2). Of
those 29 patients who experienced a worsening of renal function, 27 patients (93.1%) had normal renal
function at baseline (baseline serum creatinine <1.4
mg/dL). Renal impairment based on declines in creatinine clearance was observed in 51 patients
(41.8%). There was an increasing trend in renal impairment rates with increasing duration of zoledronic
acid treatment that was demonstrated whether we
used serum creatinine levels or calculated creatinine
clearance measures. Renal impairment rates based
on serum creatinine increased from 11.1% among
patients who received zoledronic acid for <6 months
to 26.3% among patients who received zoledronic
acid for 2 years. Using the calculated creatinine
clearance, the renal impairment rate increased from
23.9% among patients who received zoledronic acid
for <6 months to 36.8% among patients who received zoledronic acid for 2 years (Table 2). However, this increasing trend was not statistically
significant when it was evaluated by using either
measure of renal impairment.

treatment on renal impairment rates. Using serum

treatment with pamidronate experienced renal
impairment after zoledronic acid compared with 35
patients (35.0%) who had not previously received

received total treatment for <6 months to 33.3%
among patients who received total treatment for 36
months based on declines in creatinine clearance
(Fig. 2).
Table 3 shows the renal toxicity grade distribution using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The majority of patients with any renal
insufficiency had mild (grade 1) renal toxicity; however, 27 of 122 total patients (22.1%) and 26 of 29
patients (89.7%) who met the definition of renal
impairment as defined in the current study had a renal toxicity at grade 2.

Risk Factors for Renal Impairment
Table 4 shows that increasing age and prior pamidronate use were identified consistently as significant
risk factors associated with renal impairment in both
the Cox model and the Andersen-Gill model. The
Andersen-Gill model had greater power to detect
additional risk factors, including history of renal disease, history of hypertension, and history of smoking,
whereas the Cox model detected history of hypercalcemia as a risk factor.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first published study to
investigate renal toxicity in patients with HRPC who
were receiving zoledronic acid in an observational
setting. The results of this study demonstrated that
23.8% of patients had evidence of renal impairment
during treatment with zoledronic acid. Furthermore,
20.8% of the patients who discontinued zoledronic
acid did so as a result of renal complications. Significant risk factors for renal impairment in this patient
population were age at zoledronic acid initiation,
prior pamidronate use, and history of renal disease,

hypertension, and smoking (P  .05). Patients who
received second-line bisphosphonates may have had
more advanced disease than patients who received
first-line bisphosphonates, which may explain why
there was an increased risk of renal toxicity associated with prior pamidronate use. Furthermore,
because the studies of pamidronate did not indicate
a benefit in patients with HRPC,17 the number of
patients who received prior pamidronate in clinical
practice may be limited, as demonstrated in this
study (18% of patients with HRPC).
Our results are consistent with previous studies
that reported renal toxicity with approved doses of IV
zoledronic acid leading to renal dysfunction and resulting in drug discontinuation, the need for renal dialysis,
and, in rare cases, death.8 For this study, we did not
investigate the impact of reducing the dose of zoledronic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate renal
impairment; however, it is likely that this would reduce
the incidence of renal impairment in patients receiving
this bisphosphonate. Our findings also are consistent
with a preliminary observational study in patients
with prostate cancer that showed a greater incidence
of renal toxicity (27.0%) than was noted in other
clinical trials.13 Approximately 50% of all renal toxicities
in the current study were considered grade 1. These
less severe renal events may have limited clinical
impact in this population with HRPC because of
advanced malignancy and reduced life expectancy.
However, of the 29 events that met the definition of renal impairment analyzed in the current study, 26 events
(89.7%) were grade 2. No patients required any shortor long-term renal dialysis.
The risk of renal impairment increased with an
extended duration of zoledronic acid therapy and

previous pamidronate treatment. The etiologic association between zoledronic acid and renal toxicity is
strengthened by the observation of this dose-response
relation. Previous studies have shown a close temporal
link between zoledronic acid treatment, prior pamidronate exposure, and renal deterioration.8–11 For example,
Chang and colleagues suggested that the onset of renal
failure and recovery of serum creatinine levels after
drug discontinuation pointed to a temporal relation to
the use of zoledronic acid. Renal failure occurred as
early as 11 days after the first administration of zoledronic acid in 18 patients (25%), although the average time
to renal failure was 56 days of zoledronic acid use.
Furthermore, 45 of 72 patients in that study previously
had received pamidronate on a long-term basis (mean
duration of treatment, 600 days).8 In a study of 26
patients with breast cancer who received zoledronic
acid, 16 patients were switched from pamidronate to
zoledronic acid. This switch was associated with a statistically significant mean increase in serum creatinine
(P ¼ .02) compared with a lack of change in serum creatinine while they were receiving pamidronate.11 The
mean decrease in renal function was worse in patients
who received zoledronic acid after initially receiving
treatment with pamidronate compared with the
decrease in renal function in patients who received
zoledronic acid de novo. Similar results were reported
by Mazj and Lichtman: Of 35 patients who experienced
bisphosphonate-related renal dysfunction, only 5
reports were attributed to pamidronate, whereas 30
patients developed renal dysfunction with zoledronic
acid de novo (10 patients) or with prior pamidronate
use (20 patients).9 The increased risk of renal impairment from previous bisphosphonate therapy is reflected
in the prescribing information for zoledronic acid.6,7
The risk of renal deterioration also was greater in
elderly patients and in patients with prior renal
impairment, renal disease, or hypertension. These
results also are consistent with other studies. In a
retrospective review of 293 patients who received
bisphosphonates from January 2002 to June 2003, 35
patients (12%) developed renal dysfunction.9 The
incidence of renal toxicity was more prominent in
the elderly group (aged >80 years); and, with the
exception of 1 patient, all patients with renal dysfunction in that group were treated with zoledronic
acid. An increase in serum creatinine was observed
in 7 of 35 patients (20%) in the elderly group compared with other age groups (28 of 258 patients;
11%). Another retrospective study of 234 patients
who received zoledronic acid concluded that patients
with preexisting renal impairment required close observation; however, in patients with normal baseline
renal function, serum creatinine measurement prior

1095

to each dose of zoledronic acid probably was unnecessary.12 Nevertheless the prescribing information
for zoledronic acid was updated to recommend that
physicians routinely monitor renal function in all
patients. It is believed that impairment of renal function associated with zoledronic acid is related to chelation of calcium, resulting in the formation of
insoluble calcium bisphosphonate precipitates in the
renal tubule.18
Potential limitations of this study were that there
was no comparative control arm of patients with
HRPC who received chemotherapy and supportive
measures who were not receiving bisphosphonates.
This is especially relevant because patients with
prostate cancer may have renal impairment caused
by their underlying disease; therefore, a control
group would help determine more clearly the extent
of renal impairment caused by zoledronic acid treatment. The retrospective nature of this study is
another limitation; different incidences of renal
impairment have been observed in prospective, randomized studies with more stringent inclusion criteria, longer-follow-up, and greater patient numbers.4,6
However, it should be noted that there are limited
data on bisphosphonates in this patient population.
Prospective, randomized studies are needed to confirm the findings of the current retrospective study.
An additional limitation is that the current results
were based on the data that were available only from
the DFCI, except for serum creatinine measurements,
which also were obtained through primary care providers. Therefore, there is the potential for missing
information on noncancer care. Another limitation is
that the generalizability of the current study is limited to patients who are seen in a tertiary cancer
center and may not apply to the overall population
of patients with HRPC.
Given the evidence about the nephrotoxicity of
zoledronic acid, the outcomes of ongoing clinical
trials will be important. For example, a randomized
trial conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group
B is comparing the initiation of zoledronic acid in
hormone-sensitive, metastatic prostate cancer with
standard therapy at the time of HRPC. Because
newer anticancer therapies may improve patient survival, it will be important to evaluate whether
increased exposure to zoledronic acid with other
potentially nephrotoxic medications increases the
likelihood of renal toxicity.
Additional studies are warranted. It would be
worthwhile to increase the sample size of future
trials, which would increase their statistical power to
allow for a more sensitive method of examining risk
factors for renal impairment.

In summary, the results of the current study
demonstrate that, in an outpatient oncology clinical
setting, nearly 25% of patients who received zoledronic acid experienced a renal impairment event. This
renal risk is significantly higher than was reported
previously in clinical trials. Age at zoledronic acid
initiation, prior pamidronate use, and a history of renal disease, hypertension, or smoking each significantly increased the risk of renal impairment with
zoledronic acid. This suggests that these risk factors
likely are important in predicting the renal impairment associated with zoledronic acid use in patients
with HRPC who have bone metastases, and they
should be incorporated into clinical strategies to
reduce renal risk in this population. Our results reinforce existing recommendations to monitor renal
function actively in these patients.
