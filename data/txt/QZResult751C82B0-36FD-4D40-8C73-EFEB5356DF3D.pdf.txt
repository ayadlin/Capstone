ABSTRACT
Despite plenty of evidence supports an inverse association between alcohol
drinking and risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), sex-specific and beverage-specific
dose-response relationships have not been well established. We examined this
association by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective
studies. Studies were identified by comprehensively searching PubMed and EMBASE
databases through February 21, 2015. Categorical and dose-response meta-analyses
were conducted to identify the effects of alcohol on RCC. A total of eight publications
(including seven cohort studies and one pooled analysis of 12 cohort studies) were
eligible for this meta-analysis. Dose-response analysis showed that each 5 g/day
increment of alcohol intake corresponded to a 5% decrease in risk of RCC for males
and 9% for females. Alcohol intakes from wine, beer, and liquor were each associated
with a reduced risk of RCC. When these associations were examined separately by
gender, statistically significant inverse associations were restricted to alcohol from
wine among females (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–0.91) and to alcohol from beer and
from liquor among males (RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.83–0.91 and RR = 0.95, 95% CI
0.92–0.99, respectively). In conclusion, there exist gender-specific and beveragespecific differences in the association between alcohol intake and RCC risk.

[7]. However, both advanced stage disease and the mortality
rate for renal cancers have also been increasing, suggesting
that risk factors have played some role in this upward trend
[3, 6]. Based on the current evidence, cigarette smoking,
obesity and hypertension are the most well established risk
factors for RCC [2, 3].
Recent epidemiological studies have suggested
that moderate alcohol drinking may be associated with a
reduced risk of RCC [2, 3, 8]. Two well-done systematic
reviews conducted in 2012 also supported this idea [9, 10].
Nevertheless, the results of recently published prospective
cohort studies remain inconsistent or conflicting [11–13].
Karami et al. [12] showed that increasing alcohol consumption
was associated with reduced RCC risk. Macleod et al. [11]
found the trend, but they just did not reach the statistical
significance. Washio et al. [13] reported that alcohol drinking
was not related to the kidney cancer mortality. Moreover,
sex-specific and beverage-specific (beer, wine or liquor)
relationship between alcohol intake and RCC risk has not yet

INTRODUCTION
Kidney cancer is one of the ten most common types
of cancer worldwide, with over 271,000 newly diagnosed
cases and over 116,000 deaths in 2008 [1]. The most
common form, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of the renal
parenchyma, accounts for over 85% of all kidney cancers [2,
3]. RCC incidence rates vary substantially over the world.
Rates are generally high in more developed regions (e.g.,
Europe and North America) and low in less developed areas
(e.g., Asia and South America) [2]. RCC occurs twice as
often in males as in females [4]. Although the reason for
the higher incidence in developed countries and in males is
not very clear [5], the nonhomogeneity of RCC incidence
rates implies the existence of modifiable risk factors. On
the other hand, RCC incidence is rising by approximately
2 to 3% per year [1, 6], which is due in large part to the
increasing use of diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, magnetic
resonance imaging, and computerized tomography scan)

been established. We are wondering whether there is a gender
difference in this association and whether different types of
alcoholic beverages affect RCC risk differently.
We therefore conducted a dose-response metaanalysis on alcohol consumption and RCC risk by
summarizing the results of all relevant prospective
studies. Our aim was to update evidence on the association
between them, and to quantify the sex-specific and
beverage-specific dose-response relationships.

2014. The studies [11, 12, 14–19] that provided at least 3
quantitative categories of alcohol drinking were included in
dose-response meta-analysis. Most studies adjusted for age
[11, 14–19], race [11, 12, 17, 19], smoking [11, 12, 14, 15,
17–19], body mass index (BMI) [11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19],
hypertension [11, 12, 14, 17–19], and physical activity [15,
17–19]. Six studies [11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19] used incidence
of renal cell carcinoma as outcome, and two [16, 18] used
kidney cancer mortality. The points of study quality assessed
by Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale ranged from
6 to 9 (with a mean of 7.5). Detailed characteristics of the
included studies are presented in Table 1.

Categorical meta-analysis

We identified eight publications of alcohol drinking
and RCC risk [11, 12, 14–19] (Figure 1), including seven
independent cohort studies and one pooled analysis of
12 cohort studies. A total of 5,503 RCC cases were eligible
for this systematic review. Four studies were conducted
in United States [11, 12, 17, 19], one in Japan [16], one in
Korea [18], one in United Kingdom [15], and one in multiple
countries [14]. Studies were published between 2007 and

Supplementary Figure S1 shows the study-specific and
pooled RRs and 95% CIs of RCC for any, light, moderate,
and heavy drinking. When compared with non/occasional
drinking, the pooled RRs were 0.86 (95% CI 0.76–0.96;
I2 = 60.1%) for any, 0.92 (95% CI 0.83–1.01; I2 = 45.2%) for
light, 0.75 for (95% CI 0.66–0.86; I2 = 45.1%) for moderate,
and 1.08 (95% CI 0.42–2.75; I2 = 74.8%) for heavy drinking.

Dose-response meta-analysis

Table 2 gives the pooled RRs and 95% CIs of RCC
at different levels of alcohol drinking in strata of relevant
factors. For any drinking, significant results were found
in subgroups of females (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.75–0.94;
I2 = 24.6%), USA (RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–0.99;
I2 = 51.3%), quality score ≥ mean (RR = 0.89, 95% CI
0.79–0.99; I2 = 71.7%), Caucasian (RR = 0.89, 95% CI
0.81–0.97; I2 = 44.0%), and incidence (RR = 0.88, 95%
CI 0.81–0.95; I2 = 34.7%). For light drinking, results were
not materially different in strata of area, ethnicity, and
outcome, but not in other strata. For moderate drinking,
results were basically consistent in strata of sex and major
confounders adjusted, but not in other strata.
Supplementary Figure S2 presents the results of
sensitivity analysis for any, light, and moderate drinking.
The pooled RRs with 95% CIs ranged from 0.82 (95%
CI 0.74–0.92) to 0.88 (95% CI 0.79–0.98) for any, from
0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.95) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.84–1.02) for
light, and from 0.73 (95% CI 0.63–0.84) to 0.77 (95% CI
0.68–0.88) for moderate drinking, which indicated that
the pooled estimates were robust and not influenced by
a single study for any and moderate drinking, but not for
light drinking. No significant publication bias was detected
by Egger’s test and Begg’s test for any, light, and moderate
drinking (All P > 0.5).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The number of studies eligible for the dose-response
analysis was eight [11, 12, 14–19], six [12, 14, 16–19], and
five [12, 14, 15, 17, 19] for overall population, males, and
females, respectively. Accordingly, the pooled RRs of RCC
for 5 g/day increment of alcohol drinking decreased by
6% (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.92–0.95), 5% (RR = 0.95, 95%
CI 0.93–0.97), and 9% (RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.94),
respectively. Some evidence of a nonlinear relationship
between alcohol and RCC risk was found for overall
population (P = 0.03 for nonlinearity) and males (P = 0.05 for
nonlinearity). The downward trend was most obvious when
alcohol intake increased up to about 12.5 g/day (Figure 2).
Three studies [12, 14, 19] were eligible for the
beverage-specific dose-response analysis. Alcohol intakes
from wine, beer, and liquor were each associated with a
reduced risk of RCC among the overall population. The
pooled RRs for a 5 g/day increase in alcohol intake were
0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.99), 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.93), and
0.96 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), respectively (Figure 3). There
was no evidence of nonlinearity. All P values for nonlinear
assessment were >0.05.
These beverage-specific associations were then
examined separately by gender, and the statistically

DISCUSSION

significant inverse associations were restricted to alcohol
from beer and from liquor among males (RR = 0.87,
95% CI 0.83–0.91 and RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.99,
respectively) (Figure 4) and to alcohol from wine among
females (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–0.91) (Figure 5). There
was no evidence of nonlinearity. All P values for nonlinear
assessment were >0.05.
In dose-response analysis, evidence of heterogeneity
across studies was examined by the heterogeneity test. We did
not find any significant difference among study-specific
slopes in any of the dose-risk curve-fit model (All P > 0.10).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The present meta-analysis summarized the evidence
from all available prospective cohort studies and found
a significant 25% decreased risk of RCC for moderate
drinking (2–3 drinks/day), compared with non/occasional
drinking. A slightly more beneficial effect was observed
for females. The dose-response analysis showed that
each 5 g/day increment of alcohol intake corresponded
to a 5% decrease in risk of RCC for males and 9% for
females. In  beverage-specific dose-response analysis,
13353

Oncotarget

alcohol intakes from wine, beer, and liquor were each
associated with a reduced risk of RCC among the overall
population. When beverage-specific associations were
further examined separately by gender, statistically
significant inverse associations were restricted to alcohol
from beer and from liquor among males and to alcohol
from wine  among females. The findings of our study
provide new and more detailed information for the inverse
association between alcohol intake and RCC risk.
Several potential biologic mechanisms have been
proposed to explain the inverse association between
alcohol intake and RCC risk. First, light to moderate
alcohol drinking is associated with improved insulin
sensitivity [20, 21] and protective for type 2 diabetes
[22]. Increased risk of RCC has been observed for
individuals with diabetes or obesity [23, 24]. Second,
alcohol contains antioxidant phenolic compounds, which
can reduce oxidative stress and contribute to apoptosis by
arresting cell cycle [25, 26]. Third, alcohol consumption
has been inversely associated with the risk of chronic renal
failure [27], which is an important risk factor for RCC
development [28]. Forth, the diuretic effect of alcohol may
also play a role by reducing the time that carcinogenic
solutes are in contact with renal epithelial cells [14] and
controlling hypertension [29], which is also a well-known
RCC risk factor [2]. However, the association of total fluid
intake with RCC risk has not been established [29, 30].
There are risk differences between the genders for
total alcohol intake and for certain types of alcoholic
beverage. Statistically significant inverse associations
were restricted to alcohol from wine among females and
to alcohol from beer and from liquor among males, which
might be due to the discrepancy in the genetics, total
body water, metabolic characteristics of alcohol, or other
unknown factors [31, 32]. The most apparent relationships
were observed for beer among males and for wine among
females in this study, which were consist with the results
of Lee et al.’ pooled analysis [14] and another large
prospective cohort study conducted by Lew et al. [19].
This may be partially because beer was the most popular
beverage among males, while females mostly preferred
wine [33]. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism underling
the gender-specific and beverage-specific differences
remains elusive and further investigation is warranted.
Two well-done systematic reviews performed by
Bellocco et al. [9] and Song et al. [10] in 2012 has verified
the inverse association of alcohol drinking with RCC
risk. But their conclusions were drawn mainly based on
case–control studies. Moreover, the results of recently
published prospective cohort studies remain controversial
[11–13]. Hence, an updated meta-analysis of prospective
studies is needed and will provide more robust evidence
as prospective studies can minimize selection biases and
recall biases. In the present meta-analysis, despite of the
limited number of included publications, the total sample
size is large (more than 5,500 RCC cases). Furthermore,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Lee et al.’s article [14] is consist of 12 cohort studies, thus
a total of 19 independent cohort studies were actually
analyzed in this meta-analysis. Apart from an inverse, nonlinear association between total alcohol intake and RCC
risk that has been suggested in previous meta-analyses,
our study uncovers several novel and interesting findings
on gender-specific and beverage-specific differences,
which will provide some advice for people on choosing
the appropriate drink (beer, wine, or liquor).
There are also great deals of research that have
investigated the association of alcohol drinking with
other site-specific cancer risk. According to a recent
comprehensive review [34], RRs for heavy drinking
compared with non/occasional drinking were 5.13 for oral
and pharyngeal, 4.95 for esophageal, 2.65 for laryngeal,
2.64 for gallbladder, 2.07 for liver, 1.61 for breast, and
1.44 for colorectal cancer. Although our study found no
association between heavy alcohol drinking and RCC
risk, a large cohort study of alcohol abusers indicated a
significantly elevated occurrence of renal cancer in this
population [35]. In addition, although controversy still
exists, emerging evidence has indicated that moderate
drinkers tend to have better health and live longer than
those who are either abstainers or heavy drinkers [36].
Moderate drinking has shown benefits on type 2 diabetes
[22], heart health [37], strokes [38], Alzheimer’s Disease
[39], and so on. Our study offers some evidence to support
the recommendation of moderate drinking, especially beer
in males and wine in females. Klatsky et al.’ study [40]
assessed the role of alcoholic beverage choice in coronary
risk and they also suggested that beer in males and wine in
females had the strongest protection.
Our study has several strengths. First, all included
studies were prospective cohort studies with a total of
5,503 RCC cases. Prospective studies have the advantage
of being less subject to selection and recall bias than case–
control studies. Second, the combined use of categorical
and dose-response analyses provided a comprehensive
assessment of the association between alcohol drinking
and RCC risk. Third, we were able to evaluate the
associations for males and females separately and for each
alcoholic beverage.
Several limitations should also be discussed. First,
significant heterogeneity was detected in categorical
analysis. Therefore, these combined estimates should be
treated with caution, although random-effects models
were used to take heterogeneity into account. But no
obvious heterogeneity was observed for dose-response
analysis. Second, only published studies were included
in our meta-analysis. Even if Begg’s test and Egger’ test
did not suggest any evidence of publication bias, some
inevitable publication bias may exist as studies with null
results tend not to be published. Third, a meta-analysis
is unable to solve problems with confounding factors
that could be inherent in the included studies. The
possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding cannot

be excluded. Nevertheless, in majority of the original
studies, main confounders (e.g., age, race, smoking, BMI,
hypertension, and physical activity) were adjusted, or
at least mostly. Finally, the number of studies included
in the meta-analysis was limited. Because of this, more
future prospective studies are warranted to confirm the
conclusions in this study.

overlapping population were available, the most informative
one was included. In particular, we included a pooled analysis
of 12 cohort studies [14], rather than separate publications,
since seven of these cohorts had not previously reported on
this association.

CONCLUSION

Two authors independently extracted the following
data in a standard format: first author’s surname,
publication year, country, gender, age, duration of followup, the method of exposure assessment, the number of
cases, sample size (persons or person-years), covariates
adjusted in the analysis, alcohol exposure levels and
corresponding estimates with 95% CIs. For studies that
reported several multivariable-adjusted relative risks
(RRs), we extracted the RR estimate that was maximally
adjusted for potential covariates to reduce the risk of
possible residual confounding.
Two reviewers independently completed the
quality assessment using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality
Assessment Scale (http://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_
epidemiology/oxford.asp). This scale is an eight-item
instrument used to assess the selection of study population,
study comparability, and ascertainment of the outcome.
The total score ranges from zero to nine, and higher scores
indicate better methodological quality. Discrepancies were
resolved by consensus and discussion.

Data extraction and quality assessment

This updated dose-response meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies suggests there exist genderspecific and beverage-specific differences in the association
between alcohol intake and RCC risk. Statistically significant
inverse associations were restricted to alcohol from beer
and from liquor among males and to alcohol from wine
among females. Future research is needed to investigate the
potential mechanisms underlying these associations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search
This systematic review and meta-analysis was
performed according to meta-analysis of observation
studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [41].
A systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE
databases from their inception to February 21, 2015 was
conducted by two reviewers (XX and YZ), who understood
about basic structure and functions of bibliographic and
specialized databases, as well as the methodological
and technical issues associated with searching [42]. We
used the following search string in PubMed: (“kidney
cancer” OR “kidney neoplasm” OR “kidney carcinoma”
OR “renal carcinoma” OR “renal cancer” OR “renal cell
cancer” OR “renal cell carcinoma”) AND (alcohol OR
alcohols OR alcoholic OR ethanol OR wine OR beer OR
liquor) AND (cohort OR prospective OR “nested casecontrol”). A similar strategy was used in EMBASE search.
No language restriction was applied. We also reviewed the
cited references from retrieved articles and reviews for
additional relevant studies. In addition, we searched the
grey literature extensively to check for publication bias.
If relevant studies did not provide sufficient data for metaanalysis, we contacted authors to request missing data.

Statistical methods
We converted the amount of alcohol intake into a
uniform measurement of grams (g) of ethanol per day by
using the following equivalencies: 1 ml of alcohol as 0.8 g
of ethanol, one drink as 12.5 g, and 1 ounce as 28 g [44, 45],
if not otherwise specified in the original article. When a
range of alcohol consumption was provided, the median or
mean value was regarded as the corresponding exposure
dose. If the median or mean value was not reported, we
used the midpoint of each category. For upper, open-ended
exposure categories, the exposure dose was defined by the
lower bound added to the three-quarters of the adjacent
previous category [46]. The lowest categories of exposure
(i.e., non/occasional drinking) were treated as the reference
group. Alcohol drinking were classified into three levels as
light, moderate, and heavy drinking, which were defined
as ethanol intake of <12.5 g/day (<1 drink/day), 12.5–37.5
g/day (2–3 drinks/day), and >37.5 g/day (>3 drinks/day),
respectively. When multiple exposure categories lay in
one of these levels, we pooled the corresponding estimates
using the method proposed by Hamling et al. [47], thus
taking into account their correlation. In the Million Women
Study [15], we back calculate conventional 95% CIs from a
set of RRs reported with 95% floated CIs [48].
We calculated pooled RRs using random effects
model [49] that accounts for both within- and between-

Eligibility criteria
Articles included in this meta-analysis had to meet the
following criteria: (i) cohort or nested case–control study
conducted on the general population; (ii) one of the exposures
was alcohol drinking; (iii) one of the outcomes was RCC
risk; and (iv) studies reported risk estimates with their 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), or data to calculate them. Studies
on special populations (e.g., cohorts of alcoholics) [35, 43]
were not included. If multiple publications from the same or

study heterogeneity, which was also assessed by the Q
statistic (significance level at P < 0.10) and the I2 score
[50]. To evaluate the robustness of the pooled estimates,
sensitivity analysis was performed by removing each
study in turn. In order to investigate possible sources
of heterogeneity among studies, we also conducted
subgroups analyses by the available characteristics of
studies and participants.
Dose-response meta-analysis was performed by the
method described by Greenland et al. [51] and Orsini et al
[52]. Only studies that considered at least 3 quantitative
categories and provided the number of cases and personyears in each category were included. If studies only
provided the overall person-years, we estimated the
distribution of person-years using the method proposed
by Aune et al. [53]. And if the overall person-years were
also not reported, it was approximated from follow-up
duration and number of individuals [54]. We examined
a potential nonlinear dose-response relationship between
alcohol intake and RCC risk using restricted cubic splines
with three knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of
the distribution. A P value for nonlinearity was calculated
by testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the
second spline was equal to zero [55].
Publication bias was evaluated by Begg’s test
(rank correlation method) [56] and Egger’s test (linear
regression method) [57]. All statistical analyses were
performed with STATA 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX) and a two-sided P < 0.05 was considered significant.
