identified primarily from studies with neocarzinostatin (NCS), a
holo-form drug, consisting of an apoprotein carrier and an active
chromophore, and was assumed to be representative of all agents
in this class (11). The NCS chromophore contains a bicyclic
enediyne that damages DNA via a Myers-Saito cycloaromatization
reaction, resulting in a 2,6-indacene diradical structure capable of
hydrogen abstractions from deoxyribose (12, 13). Subsequent to
generation of a sugar radical, reaction with oxygen quickly and
efficiently leads to formation of hydroxyl radicals that induce
DSBs/SSBs at a 1:5 ratio. The more recently discovered holo-form
enediyne C-1027 (Fig. 1) induces predominately DSBs owing to the
efficiency of hydrogen abstraction by its 1,4-benzenoid diradical
that results from a similar Bergman cycloaromatization reaction
(14, 15). Although DSBs induced by either NCS or C-1027 are
created with a two base pair stagger, variations in alignment of the
diradical element results in different spectrums of preferential
cleavage sites (16–18).
In addition to DSBs, a little known aspect of certain enediynes is
that they can form monofunctional and bifunctional adducts with
cell-free oligonucleotides under anoxic conditions (19, 20).
Although the mechanism of adduct formation remains unclear, it
is thought that the deoxyribose radical cannot convert to a
hydroxyl radical in the absence of oxygen. Instead, it binds back to
the drug, forming a DNA adduct. That adduct formation under
anoxic conditions is limited to certain enediynes was indicated by
the fact that C-1027 can induce ICLs, whereas calicheamicin, which
also induces primarily DSBs, produced no detectable adducts (19).
In cells, IR and other radiomimetic agents induce cells to
respond to DNA DSBs by activation, via the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase–like kinase ATM, of cell cycle checkpoint proteins that
delay cell cycle progression to allow DNA repair and preserve
chromosomal integrity (21). However, recent studies with C-1027
and selected analogues revealed that robust activation of cell cycle
checkpoints and cell death hypersensitivity was independent of
ATM or ATR status (6, 7, 22). In addition to ATM phosphorylation,
these enediynes were able induce activation of the rad3 related
kinase, ATR generally associated with DNA damage that leads to
replication fork stalling (e.g, ICLs; ref. 23).
This sole exception to ATM-dependent responses to DNA DSBs
was explained by the discovery that C-1027 exhibits a novel
DNA-damaging activity in cells: an ability to induce concurrently
DSBs and ICLs in normoxic cells (24). Cellular ICLs induction by
C-1027 was unexpected because deoxyribose radicals should be
readily converted to hydroxyl radicals in normoxic cells (25). The
presence of both types of cellular DNA lesions explains why either
ATM or ATR can regulate DNA damage responses (24).
To date, C-1027 is the only drug known to generate DNA damage
that is balanced between DNA breaks and ICLs in a normoxic
cellular environment. In a hypoxic environment, C-1027 might be
expected to induce fewer DSBs, whereas ICL formation, which

Abstract
The hypoxic nature of cells within solid tumors limits the
efficacy of anticancer therapies such as ionizing radiation and
conventional radiomimetics because their mechanisms require oxygen to induce lethal DNA breaks. For example, the
conventional radiomimetic enediyne neocarzinostatin is 4fold less cytotoxic to cells maintained in low oxygen (hypoxic)
compared with normoxic conditions. By contrast, the enediyne C-1027 was nearly 3-fold more cytotoxic to hypoxic than
to normoxic cells. Like other radiomimetics, C-1027 induced
DNA breaks to a lesser extent in cell-free, or cellular hypoxic,
compared with normoxic environments. However, the unique
DNA interstrand cross-linking ability of C-1027 was markedly
enhanced under the same hypoxic conditions that reduced
its DNA break induction. Although the unique chemistry of
C-1027 allows it to concurrently generate both DNA breaks
and cross-links in normoxic cells, a low oxygen environment
represses the former and promotes the latter. Thus, treatment
with C-1027 offers a facile approach for overcoming the
radioresistance associated with poorly oxygenated cells.

Introduction
It has long been recognized that hypoxic cells associated with
tumor microenvironments, as well as cells grown under conditions
of low oxygen, are more difficult to kill with ionizing radiation (IR),
which uses oxygen for its DNA strand scission activity (1).
Essentially, the deoxyribose radicals generated by radiation
abstraction of hydrogen from DNA require sufficient oxygen levels
to allow their conversion along a pathway leading to DNA breaks
(2, 3). Radiomimetic enediyne anticancer drugs reportedly suffer
the same limitation, as break induction occurs via a similar oxygenmediated mechanism (4, 5). However, recent findings identified a
family of designer enediynes, which can induce an additional type
of DNA damage, interstrand cross-links (ICLs). Because oxygen is
not required for ICL formation, these enediynes may be exploited
for targeting hypoxic cells (6, 7).
Although IR induces a plethora of DNA damage events in
addition to double (DSB) and single-strand breaks (SSB), including
a variety of DNA degradation products, enediynes generally induce
only a subset of these lesions ( frank DNA strand breaks; refs. 8–10).
The mechanism of action of enediyne DNA break induction was

plate and stirred gently in the hypoxia chamber that had been preequilibrated to 0.5% O2 and 5% CO2, unless otherwise indicated. After 1 h,
HCT116 cells grown under normoxic conditions were placed in the hypoxia
chamber, and the cell medium was replaced with 2 mL of the preequilibrated hypoxic medium. Cells were covered with aluminum foil and
incubated on a dry block at 37jC. After 2 h,3 enediynes diluted as described
above in hypoxic water were added, and incubation continued for 1 h.
Normoxic samples were treated similarly, except they were left in a standard
CO2 incubator at 37jC for an identical time period and treated with
enediynes diluted in normoxic water.
IR treatment of cells. After drug treatment, medium was removed and
cells were immediately irradiated on ice under normoxic conditions using a
Philips RT 250 Orthovoltage X-ray Unit (GE Healthcare) with a 0.5-mm Cu
filter at 20 Gy, and harvested.
Comet analysis. After enediyne incubations with or without IR
treatment, HCT116 cells were analyzed as described previously (7). Briefly,
cells were harvested by Trypsin/EDTA detachment, resuspended in PBS at a
concentration of 1  107/mL, diluted into low-melting-temperature agarose,
and placed on an agarose-coated slide. The slides were left on ice for
30 min, then immersed in alkaline lysis buffer (pH 13) and placed at 4jC
overnight. Slides were equilibrated for 20 min in alkaline electrophoresis
buffer before electrophoresis at 27V for 25 min at 4jC. Subsequently, slides
were neutralized by washing in 0.4 mol/L Tris (pH 7.5), thrice for 5 min, and
dried after immersion first in methanol and then in ethanol. Cells were
visualized with ethidium bromide and imaged. Because the smaller the DNA
fragment the more rapid its migration through agarose, the intensity and
length of the DNA tail (Comet) extruding from the nucleus was
proportional to the level of DNA breaks. Comet signals were quantified
by tail intensity expressed as a percentage of the total intensity of the comet
using Comet Assay IV software (Perceptive Instruments). Typically, 5 fields
were imaged for each treatment condition from which 50 to 60 comets were
selected to ensure a representative analysis.
Immunoblotting. After drug treatment, total cellular extracts were
prepared for Western analysis as described previously (6). Essentially, cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation and equal amounts of protein were
electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane, and probed with the primary antibody Anti–phospho-Histone
gH2AX (Ser 139; Millipore) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Chemiluminescent protein bands
were visualized on X-ray film and quantified using the Gel Doc XR System
and ImageQuant software.
Cytotoxicity. HCT116 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 3  105 cells
per well and incubated overnight. Cells were rendered hypoxic (as described
above), or left normoxic, and enediyne was added. After 1 h, cells were
detached using trypsin, counted, diluted, and replated in duplicate at 1,000,
300, or 100 cells per well. After 10 d of growth in a CO2 incubator under
normoxic conditions, cells were stained and fixed in Methylene Blue/
methanol. Individual colonies of 50 or more cells were counted, and plating
efficiency was calculated relative to that of untreated (control) cells.
Evaluation of drug cytotoxicity was based on three or more experiments.

evaluated the oxygen dependence of C-1027 induction of DNA
breaks and cross-links and whether C-1027 would overcome the
radioresistance associated with hypoxic cells.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Fermentation, production, isolation, and purification of
C-1027 from Streptomyces globisporus were carried out as described (26).
NCS was a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Stock solutions of all
compounds were stored at 20jC and diluted in double-distilled water
before use.
Drug preparations. For dilutions under hypoxic conditions, aliquots of
drugs were placed in a BioSpherix chamber (BioSpherix, Ltd.) preequilibrated to gas phase O2 at 0.5% unless indicated otherwise, and
diluted immediately before use with water pre-equilibrated in the chamber
overnight. Separate dilutions for normoxic samples were prepared at the
same time.
Hypoxic conditions for cell-free assays. Tubes containing DNA and
1 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) were placed in a hypoxia chamber equilibrated to
gas phase O2 at 0.5% unless otherwise indicated.
Cell-free DSB and ICL detection. For DNA break detection, 100 ng of
supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA (New England Biolabs) was incubated
with drug in the presence of 1 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) at 37jC under hypoxic
(0.5% O2) or normoxic conditions. After incubation for 30 min, tubes were
removed from the chamber and loading dye was added. The DNA was
electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel to separate forms, visualized by
staining with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen Corp.), imaged on the GelDoc XR (BioRad Corp.), and quantified using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software
(GE Healthcare).
For ICL detection, EcoR1 restriction enzyme (Fermentas, Inc.) was used
to linearize pBR322 DNA. DNA (200 ng) and drug were incubated with
1 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) at 37jC under hypoxic conditions for the
appropriate time. After incubation, denaturation buffer was added to
achieve a final concentration of 60 mmol/L NaOH, 10 mmol/L NaCl, and
0.1 mmol/L EDTA under normoxic conditions for 15 min before the
addition of loading dye and electrophoresis of DNA as described above.
Cells. HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (a gift from Dr. B.
Vogelstein, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, John Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD) were grown in McCoy’s 5A, 10% fetal bovine
serum and Pen/strep for 24 h in 6-well dishes, 3  105 cells per well, at 37jC
and 5% CO2.
Hypoxic conditions for cell culture. Fifty milliliters of medium in an
uncapped sterile bottle covered with aluminum foil were placed on a stir

Results
Oxygen dependence of C-1027–induced DNA damage under
cell-free conditions. The discovery of the ability of C-1027 to
induce ICLs was initially observed by treatment of an oligonucleotide under cell-free anoxic conditions that suppressed DSBs
formation (20). To establish whether suppression of DNA breaks
occurs under hypoxia, a less stringent oxygen deprivation
condition, plasmid DNA was equilibrated to 0.5% gas phase O2
before addition of C-1027. Gel electrophoretic analysis identified

Based on optimal suppression of enediyne-induced cellular DNA breaks, it was
determined that 2 h was the minimum time necessary for the cells to achieve a
hypoxic state.

The Radiomimetic C-1027 Targets Hypoxic Cells

Figure 2. C-1027 induced damage of cell-free plasmid
DNA under hypoxic conditions. A, plasmid DNA was
treated with varying concentrations of C-1027 for 1 h at
37jC under hypoxic (H ) or normoxic (N ) conditions and
electrophoresed on agarose gels (see Materials and
Methods). DNA breaks were shown by decreases in
supercoiled form I (FI) and increases in nicked circular
form II (FII) or linear form III (FIII). The percent of
FI relative to total DNA is indicated for each lane.
B, C-1027 cross-link activity was determined by
treatment of linearized plasmid DNA with the indicated
concentrations of C-1027 for 2 h at 37jC, followed by
alkaline denaturation and agarose gel electrophoresis
(see Materials and Methods). The upper band
represents denaturation-resistant double-strand
DNA and the lower band denatured DNA. ND is a
nondenatured control lane, and % of ND indicates the
relative percentage of nondenatured (i.e., cross-linked)
duplex DNA compared with the nondenatured control.
C, time-dependant cross-link induction was shown by
treatment of linearized plasmid DNA with 150 nmol/L
C-1027 for the indicated times at 37jC, followed by
alkaline denaturation and electrophoresis as
described in B.

radicals before they can be rendered inactive by interactions with
cellular thiols like glutathiones is limiting (1, 19, 25). To test
this prediction, cells were equilibrated to 0.5% gas phase O2,
C-1027 treated, and assayed by Western analysis for induction of
phosphorylated H2AX, a surrogate marker for DSBs (26). Figure 3A
is a representative Western blot that reveals a significant decrease
in phosphorylated H2AX signaling, and, hence, DSBs, in hypoxic
versus normoxic cells treated with 0.5 to 4.5 nmol/L C-1027. The

DNA breaks based on topological forms conversion of the plasmid.
Figure 2A reveals a significant decrease in C-1027 strand scission
activity in hypoxic compared with normoxic samples. For example,
at 250 nmol/L C-1027, the amount of uncut supercoiled plasmid
DNA in the hypoxic sample is 2.2-fold greater than the amount in
the normoxic sample. A similar strategy was applied to test damage
induction at different O2 levels. At 3% O2, full cleavage activity was
obtained, whereas concentrations below 0.5% O2 (e.g., < 0.2%), did
not reduce DNA breakage below that observed with 0.5% (data not
shown).
Recently, cross-linking of plasmid DNA under anoxic conditions
was revealed by showing that C-1027–treated DNA was resistant to
strand separation under alkaline conditions (24). Using a similar
approach, cross-link formation was measured under hypoxic
conditions that repress breaks (0.5% O2). The electrophoretic gel
analysis in Fig. 2B shows C-1027’s concentration-dependent
induction of cross-links after a 1-hour incubation, based on the
amount of linearized plasmid DNA that resisted alkaline induced
strand separation. At the highest drug level tested, 150 nmol/L,
nearly 12% of the DNA failed to denature (i.e., cross-linked).
Because enediyne induction of deoxyribose radicals and subsequent DNA breaks is a rapid process (i.e., breaks are detectable
within several minutes), ICLs that likely arise from sugar radicals
also should form rapidly (25). The time course shown in Fig. 2C
was carried out using 150 nmol/L C-1027 and revealed that ICLs
are readily detectable (1.5%) after 5 minutes, and continue to
increase (8.5%) up to the 60-minute time point.
Enediyne induction of cellular H2AX signaling under
hypoxic conditions. Unlike a cell-free environment in which
DNA strand scission and cross-linking activity predominate under
normoxic and anoxic/hypoxic conditions, respectively, in cells,
C-1027 has a unique ability to induce DSBs and ICLs concurrently
(24). How formation of these lesions is influenced by a hypoxic
cellular environment was investigated. Based primarily on cell-free
studies with IR and radiomimetics, DSB activity should decrease in
hypoxic cells because the oxygen required to trap deoxyribose

C-1027 for 1 h at 37jC. Cellular extracts were analyzed by Western blotting and
probed with an antibody specific for phosphorylated gH2AX (see Materials
and Methods). B, the bar graph represents the average of at least three Western
blots comparing the percentage of gH2AX phosphorylation induced over a
range of concentrations of C-1027 (0.5–4.5 nmol/L), NCS (100–200 nmol/L),
and calicheamicin (0.5–4.5 nmol/L) under hypoxic conditions relative to normoxic
treatments.

DNA strand separation. For example, when cells were treated with
the non cross-linking member of the C-1027 family, deschloroC-1027, followed by IR, a significant increase in the IR-induced
Comet signal was observed due to the DNA breaks induced by
5nmol/L deschloro-C-1027 (e.g., 148% of IR alone). However, treatment with C-1027 produced a modest decrease in the expected
C-1027 plus IR Comet signal (24).
To test whether hypoxic conditions alter C-1027 cross-linking
potential, cells equilibrated with 0.5% gas phase O2 were treated
with C-1027 for 1 h, removed from the chamber, and irradiated
before assessing DNA breaks via Comet. Figure 5A shows
representative Comet images that reveal the ability of C-1027 to
reduce the size of IR-generated Comets. A smaller C-1027–induced
Comet was observed under hypoxic compared with normoxic
conditions. Also, irradiated cells pretreated with C-1027 formed
Comets that were dramatically reduced in size. Based on
measurements of the Comet tail moment, increasing concentrations of C-1027 resulted in correspondingly more severe reductions
in the combined drug plus IR Comet signal consistent with
substantial increases in ICLs (Fig. 5B). Notably, the higher
concentrations of C-1027, (i.e., 5.0 and 10 nmol/L) dramatically
reduced the combined drug plus IR Comet to 10% or less of the IR
alone value (Fig. 5C). In striking contrast, in a previous study under
normoxic conditions, C-1027 plus IR Comets were 90% the
intensity of those induced by IR alone (24). For comparison, NCS

A, representative alkaline Comet (see Materials and Methods) images are
shown of HCT116 cells incubated with C-1027 for 1 h under hypoxic or normoxic
conditions. B, the extent of DNA breaks is reflected by quantitation of Comet
tail intensity as described in Materials and Methods. The bar graph represents
the average of 2 to 3 experiments that measured the oxygen-dependent
break activity of C-1027, NCS, and calicheamicin expressed as a percentage
of break activity in hypoxic relative to normoxic cells.

oxygen sensitivity of DSB repression in cells is not unexpected and
was similar to that observed with other enediynes, including NCS
and calicheamicin (Fig. 3B).
Oxygen dependence of C-1027 induction of cellular DNA
breaks. DNA damage response pathways including repair proteins
are effected by hypoxia and could influence H2AX signaling
(27, 28). The influence of oxygen on C-1027 break activity also was
evaluated using a more direct assessment of DNA breaks. Alkaline
Comet electrophoretic analysis of single cells can be used to show
the extent of DNA breaks, which are proportional to the length of
the DNA tail extruding from the nucleus (29). Figure 4A reveals a
significant reduction in the Comet signals of cells treated under
hypoxic versus normoxic conditions. Quantitation of the extent of
DNA break repression as a function of oxygen is in general
agreement with that identified by Western analysis. Like the cellfree experiments, significant repression and full restoration of
cellular DNA damage induction were observed at 0.5% O2 and 3%
O2, respectively (Fig. 4B).
C-1027 induction of cellular ICLs under hypoxic conditions.
DSB suppression under low-oxygen conditions suggests that
deoxyribose radicals are not efficiently converted to hydroxyl
radicals/DNA breaks. If so, the formation of ICLs rather than DSBs
may be expected under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions. In a
prior study, Comet analysis was used to detect not only C-1027
induced DNA breaks but also cross-links (24). In those experiments, cells were treated sequentially with C-1027 and IR. If C-1027
caused only DSBs, the Comet score resulting from the combination
of C-1027 and IR treatment should equal the sum of the scores
obtained with each agent individually. If C-1027 induced not only
strand breaks but also ICLs, the Comet signal would be noticeably
less than the sum of the individual scores because cross-links
would render IR-fragmented DNA resistant to alkaline-induced

(as well as calicheamicin; data not shown), which lacks an ability to
cross-link, produced a corresponding increase in the drug plus IR
signal to 160% of the IR alone signal under hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 5C).
Cytotoxicity of enediynes under normoxic and hypoxic
conditions. Treatment with IR or radiomimetics such as
esperamicin or NCS results in diminished cytotoxicity in hypoxic
compared with normoxic cells, presumably due to reduced DSBs
formation (1, 30). To corroborate these findings, we treated
HCT116 cells with NCS under hypoxic conditions that we
determined would suppress break induction (data not shown)
and then measured cytotoxicity based on a colony formation assay
carried out under normoxic conditions. Figure 6B shows that
survival was increased when cells were treated with NCS under
hypoxic compared with normoxic conditions. By contrast, a similar
experiment showed that survival was decreased when cells were
treated with C-1027 under hypoxic compared with normoxic
conditions (Fig. 6A). Overall, hypoxic cells were nearly 4-fold more
resistant to NCS, but 3-fold more sensitive to C-1027 cytotoxicity,
than were normoxic cells. Thus, killing of hypoxic cells by C-1027 is
enhanced about an order of magnitude over that of the
conventional radiomimetic drug NCS.

Discussion
Figure 6. Oxygen dependence of enediyne cytotoxicity. HCT116 cells were
incubated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 1 h with either (A) C-1027 or
(B ) NCS. Cells were collected, replated, and grown for 10 d under normoxic
conditions. Cells were stained, and cell colonies were counted. Colony formation
was expressed as plating efficiency relative to control cell samples (see Materials
and Methods). A and B compare C-1027 and NCS cytotoxicity, respectively,
under hypoxic and normoxic treatment conditions.

The paradigm for the interaction of aromatized enediyne core
diradicals with DNA depicts deoxyribose radicals generated from
hydrogen abstraction reactions culminating in DNA breaks through
an oxygen mediated mechanism (31). The unprecedented ability
of C-1027 to induce both DSBs and ICLs in cells, an apparent
contradiction to the current model, prompted an investigation of
the oxygen dependence of its DNA-damaging activities. Implicitly,
the fate of C-1027 generated sugar radicals seems balanced
between completing the reactions required to induce DNA breaks
or binding back to the drug to form a cross-link. If the DNA
damage shifts toward ICLs in low-oxygen environments, then C1027 unlike IR has the potential to target cells within hypoxic
microenvironments associated with many solid tumors (1).
The inverse relationship between the DSB and ICL activity of
C-1027 is apparent from cell-free experiments in which breaks are
suppressed under the hypoxic conditions (0.5% O2) required for
cross-link formation (Fig. 2A). The findings are consistent with
observations from the Goldberg laboratory that under anoxic
conditions, C-1027 generated deoxyribose radicals can rebind to
portions of the aromatized enediyne core positioned within the
DNA minor groove leading to ICL formation (19, 20). Although
the 50% reduction of DSBs under hypoxic conditions is less than
the decreases (>80%) reported for anoxia, it is apparently sufficient
to allow ICLs to form (20, 31). Also, like DNA breaks, ICLs form
rapidly (Fig. 2C), which supports the notion that both are generated
from unstable deoxyribose radicals, which need to commit to
either type of DNA damage to avoid inactivation (25).
Similar to cell-free experiments, cells treated with C-1027 show
substantial decreases in DSBs under hypoxic conditions based on
either gH2AX activation or tail Comet intensity (i.e., 45% and 60%
decreases, respectively; Figs. 3 and 4).4 At the same time, ICL

induction in hypoxic cells is increased and is well above levels
detected in earlier studies carried out in normoxic cells (Fig. 5; 24).
In both cell-free and cellular environments, hypoxia results in
decreased oxidation of deoxyribose radicals, which preserves their
potential to rebind the drug and form ICLs (19, 25). It had been
presumed that even in cellular environments with available
deoxyribose radicals, the presence of hydrogen donors such as
glutathiones would readily lead to quenching. Although conditions
promoting deoxyribose radicals rebinding to the drug are not wellunderstood, positioning of the drug within the DNA minor groove,
availability of oxygen, as well as the presence of reducing factors
are considered critical (19). The oxidizing environment within
normoxic cells seems compatible with generation of both C-1027–
induced breaks and cross-links (24). The repressed oxidative state
in hypoxic cells apparently promotes the ICL activity of the drug at
the expense of DNA breaks. Although C-1027 provides a novel
agent for targeting DNA in low-oxygen environments, the basis for
its unique DNA-damaging ability in normoxic and hypoxic cells is
unclear. All enediynes, including C-1027, trigger a DNA breakage
reaction by going through a cycloaromatization process via a
Myers-Saito or Bergman-type rearrangement resulting in biradicals
capable of position-specific hydrogen abstraction from the
deoxyribose backbone of DNA (32). At present, predicting whether
an enediyne has the potential to induce DSBs, ICLs, or both is not
possible. Although all known enediynes (with the exception of the
engineered C-1027 analogue, desmethyl-C-1027) induce robust
amounts of DSBs, an accompanying ICL activity may depend on
the reactivity as well as the proximity and steric availability of the
aromatized enediyne chromophore to the deoxyribose radicals (7,

4
Because C-1027 induces breaks and cross-links, the more robust reduction in
comet signal could be due in part to increased ICL activity, which would also tend to
depress the comet score.

ICLs under hypoxic conditions that approximate a radioresistant
environment (1% O2 or lower) for many types of human tumors
suggests a potential for using C-1027 based enediynes to target
hypoxic cells within tumors (1, 33). These findings also highlight
the potential for rational engineering of C-1027 as well as other
enediyne biosynthetic pathways based on SAR studies to yield
new generations of enediyne analogues that could be explored as
antitumor (34).

19, 24). The precise mechanistic reasons for the differing activities
of C-1027 and its designer analogues also are unclear. However,
that the desmethyl-C-1027 analogue predominately induces ICLs
indicates the potential for fine tuning the DNA-damaging activity
of enediynes by introducing minimal structural perturbation.
Similarly, other C-1027 analogues with modifications of the
enediyne core, such as deschloro-C-1027, induce primarily cellular
DSBs and not ICLs (24). Interestingly, the degree to which C-1027
and its analogues induce DSBs, ICLs, or both correlates with
whether DNA damage responses are regulated by ATM, ATR, or
both, respectively (6, 7, 24).
Treatment of hypoxic cells with NCS, as with IR or other
radiomimetics, decreased DNA breaks, and a 4-fold drop in
cytotoxicity was observed (Fig. 6B). Although it is difficult to
judge the cytotoxic potential of DSBs versus ICLs, the DNA
damage induced by C-1027 revealed decreased breaks and
elevated cross-links and a corresponding 2.7-fold increase in
cytotoxicity in hypoxic compared with normoxic cells (Fig. 6A).
Thus, increased ICLs production seemed to correlate with
increased cytotoxicity. That C-1027 DNA damage shifts toward
