Abstract
RRx-001 is a novel aerospace-derived compound currently under investigation
in several ongoing Phase II studies. In a Phase I trial, it demonstrated anti-cancer
activity and evidence of resensitization to formerly effective therapies in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors. RRx-001 generates reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) and nitric oxide (NO), elicits changes in
intracellular redox status, modulates tumor blood flow, hypoxia and vascular function
and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells. We investigated the effect of RRx-001 on the
epigenome of SCC VII cancer cells. RRx-001 at 0.5 and 2 μM significantly decreased
global DNA methylation, i.e., 5-methylcytosine levels, in SCC VII cells. Consistently,
0.5-5 μM RRx-001 significantly decreased Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein expression in a
dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, global methylation profiling identified
differentially methylated genes in SCC VII cells treated with 0.5, 2, and 5 μM RRx-001
compared to control cells. Twenty-three target sites were hypomethylated and 22
hypermethylated by >10% in the presence of at least two different concentrations
of RRx-001. Moreover, RRx-001 at 2 μM significantly increased global acetylated
histone H3 and H4 levels in SCC VII cells after 24 hour treatment, suggesting that
RRx-001 regulates global acetylation in cancer cells. These results demonstrate that,
in contrast to the traditional “one drug one target” paradigm, RRx-001 has multi(epi)
target features, which contribute to its anti-cancer activity and may rationalize the
resensitization to previously effective therapies observed in clinical trials and serve
as a unifying mechanism for its anticancer activity.

INTRODUCTION

pathological conditions besides cancer including malaria
[4], hemorrhagic shock [5] and sickle cell anemia [6].
The multiple mechanisms of activity in cancer include
generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
(RONS), including nitric oxide (NO), modulation of
intracellular redox status, modulation of tumor-selective
vascular blood flow and induction of apoptosis [3].
Additional mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
The ubiquitous nature of epigenetic alterations in
all types of cancer underlies their important oncogenic
role [7-9]. For example, abnormal DNA methylation is
a feature of most cancers, and mutations in the enzymes
that add methyl groups to DNA have been associated
with some cancer types. The inherent malleability

compound under active investigation as a chemo-,

In Phase I, it demonstrated encouraging evidence of
antitumor activity including resensitization to formerly
effective chemotherapy while exhibiting a benign safety
profile in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/
refractory solid tumors [1]. With a pharmacologically
unprecedented per-nitro heterocyclic scaffold, RRx-001

and adaptability of the epigenome, in contrast to the
relative stability of the genome, suggests the possibility
of therapeutic intervention; indeed, epigenetic therapy
has emerged as a novel treatment strategy to sensitize
or “prime” solid tumors (especially ovarian cancer),
leukemias and lymphomas to standard chemotherapy,
immunotherapy and radiation [10]. Two inhibitors of
DNA methyltransferases, azacytidine (vidaza) and 5-aza2’-deoxycytidine (decitibine), have already been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as effective
drugs for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes [11]. An inhibitor of histone deacetylases,
vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid), is approved
for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [12].
Other epigenetic drugs targeting histone modifying
enzymes or DNA methylation are in clinical trials or
development [7].
Here, these experiments determined the effects of
RRx-001 on the epigenome of cancer cells. Squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC VII) cells were treated with RRx-001 at
its therapeutic concentrations (0.5-5 μM) and global DNA
methylation, i.e., 5-methylcytosine levels, was determined
by ELISA. In addition, global methylation profiling of
treated and control cells was carried out using Illumina
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips®. Expression
of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a proteins was examined in treated
and control cells by Western blot. Moreover, global
levels of acetylated histone H3 and H4 levels in SCC
VII cells were determined by a fluorometric assay. These
results, which demonstrate modification of both the DNA
methylation and histone acetylation status in cancer cells,
characterize RRx-001 as a pan-epigenetic inhibitor.

To determine the effect of RRx-001 on global 5-mC
levels in SCC VII cells, the cells were treated with 0.5,
2 or 5 μM RRx-001 for 72 hours and 5-mC levels were
measured by ELISA. For comparison, cells were also
treated with 5-azacytidine, a known epigenetic modifier
causing DNA demethylation. As expected, 5-azacytidine
at 0.5 and 2 μM significantly decreased global 5-mC
levels in SCC VII cells (Figure 1). Treatment of SCC
VII cells with 0.5 and 2 μM RRx-001 also significantly
decreased global 5-mC levels (Figure 1), demonstrating
demethylating capability of RRx-001. Of note, the
degree of demethylation induced by 5-azacytidine was
greater at 0.5 μM than at 2 μM, consistent with previous
findings that, in some cases, lower concentrations of
5-azacytidine elicited a greater effect on methylation
than higher concentrations, when DNA damage and
apoptosis become more prominent [13, 14]. Interestingly,
RRx-001 also induced epigenetic effects at lower rather
than higher concentrations: whereas 0.5 and 2 μM
demonstrated equivalent demethylating potency, 5 μM did
not significantly alter 5-mC levels from untreated controls.
These results indicate that RRx-001 is a demethylating
agent in cancer cells at therapeutic concentrations of 0.5
- 2 μM.

determine the 5-mC level in an ELISA assay. * indicates statistical significance determined by Student’s t-test.

RRx-001 in a dose-dependent manner. Daily refreshment
of RRx-001 resulted in greater inhibition of Dnmt1 and
Dnmt3a expression in SCC VII cells compared to singleadministration RRx-001 (not shown). In addition, RRx001 decreased the levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a proteins in
human PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
4C and 4D). These results demonstrated that RRx-001
suppressed Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein expression in both
murine and human cancer cells, suggesting that RRx-001
decreased global DNA methylation in SCC VII cells by
modulating levels of these proteins.

To determine gene-specific effects of RRx-001
on DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale, DNA
methylation profiles of SCC VII cells treated with either
DMSO as a control and 0.5, 2 or 5 μM RRx-001 were
analyzed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChips®. The utility of Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChips® in interrogating
mouse DNA methylation profiles has been demonstrated
recently by Wong et al. [15]. Of the 13,715 probe
sequences matched to bisulfite-converted mouse genomic
DNA, 12,023 had a detection p-value <0.05 across all
samples. RRx-001 decreased methylation levels of 5
target sites by >10% across all concentrations compared
to control (Table 1). In addition, 23 target sites were
demethylated by >10% in at least two treatments (Figure
2). Similarly, RRx-001 increased methylation levels of 2
target sites by >10% across all concentrations compared to
control (Table 1) and 22 target sites were hypermethylated
by >10% in at least two treatments (Figure 2). These
results provide direct evidence that RRx-001 consistently
regulated DNA methylation in SCC VII cells.
To determine the gene pathways affected by changes
in methylation induced by RRx-001, pathway enrichment
analyses were performed using IPA. Eight pathways
were significantly enriched in the 23 hypomethylated and
22 hypermethylated genes (Figure 3), including PI3K
signaling in B lymphocytes, human embryonic stem cell
pluripotency and molecular mechanisms of cancer.

RRx-001 significantly increased global acetylated
histone H3 and H4 levels
To evaluate effects of RRx-001 on histone
acetylation, a fluorometric assay was used to measure
total acetylated histone H3 and H4 levels in SCC VII cells
after 24 hours of treatment with the drug. As shown in
Figure 5, RRx-001 significantly increased the level of total
acetylated histone H3 protein at 2 µM and 5 µM compared
to control. In addition, the level of total acetylated histone
H4 protein was significantly increased by 0.5 µM and 2
µM RRx-001, showing that RRx-001 upregulates global
acetylation in SCC VII cells.

DISCUSSION
Emerging data from ongoing clinical trials with
RRx-001 implicate epigenetic modification of gene
expression as a major mechanism by which it elicits
both single-agent antitumor activity and sensitization/
resensitization to standard chemotherapies [16]. Results
from a Phase I trial in heavily pretreated patients with
advanced/refractory solid tumors were notable for the
lack of systemic toxicity at all doses tested and evidence
of anticancer efficacy, with 15 of 25 patients exhibiting
partial response or stable disease [1]. Furthermore, after
progression on RRx-001 treatment, 4 patients were
rechallenged with drugs to which they had previously
acquired resistance, and all 4 exhibited resensitization [1].
Preliminary results from ongoing Phase II clinical trials

RRx-001 inhibited expression of Dnmt1 and
Dnmt3a in SCC VII and PANC-1 cells
To investigate the mechanism by which RRx-001
decreased global 5-mC levels, the protein levels of two
DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a, were
evaluated by Western blot. As shown in Figure 4A and 4B,
the levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a proteins in SCC VII cells
were reduced gradually over the 3-day exposure to 1-5 µM

profile from Phase I and provided initial confirmation of
antitumor priming to subsequent therapy post-RRx-001.
To date, in a randomized Phase II trial against regorafenib,
9 of 12 irinotecan-refractory RRx-001 colorectal patients
have been resensitized to irinotecan, which contrasts
sharply with the experience of regorafenib patients who
have been too debilitated and systemically unwell to
receive any subsequent salvage therapies [17]. Since
reversal of epigenetic-induced gene silencing has been
linked to chemo-resensitization [10, 18], these experiments
were designed to investigate whether RRx-001 affects the
epigenome. In the syngeneic SCC VII preclinical model of
squamous cell carcinoma that has been used extensively to
study the activity of RRx-001 [2, 19], RRx-001 decreased
both global DNA 5-mC levels and increased histone H3
and H4 acetylation at clinically relevant therapeutic doses.
These activities are relevant to anti-cancer efficacy of
RRx-001 as a single agent as well as to its potential as a
chemo-, radio- and immunosensitizer.
DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that
regulates chromatin compaction and gene expression, and
silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation
is a common feature of cancer [19]. Enzymes that catalyze

the transfer of methyl groups onto cytosine residues are
Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [19]. Dnmt1 is a “copy”
DNA methyltransferase that maintains methylation once
epigenetic marks are in place. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b
are de novo methyltransferases, which establish the
initial patterns of DNA methylation. DNA methylation
inhibitors in clinical use (decitabine and vidaza) and
other similar nucleoside analogues incorporate into DNA
during replication and block further DNA methylation.
Decitabine inhibits Dnmt by forming an irreversible
covalent bond with the active site of the enzyme, depletes
Dnmt through proteosomal degradation, and induces
global DNA hypomethylation [20, 21]. Like the nucleoside
analogues, RRx-001 reduced protein levels of Dnmt1
and Dnmt3a in a time- and dose-dependent manner and
decreased global DNA methylation. Moreover, RRx-001,
which does not fit the standard profile of a molecularly
targeted agent, is likely to interfere indirectly with the
DNA methylation pathway rather than directly like
decitabine and vidaza. Oxidative stress has been linked
to loss of methylation due to ROS-induced DNA damage.
The DNA lesions caused by ROS can impede the ability
of DNA to function as a substrate for Dnmts, resulting
in global hypomethylation [22, 23]. In addition, excess

oxidative stress, which decreases glutathione levels, also
leads to undermethylation, possibly through depletion of
the primary methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine
[24]. Furthermore, H2O2 may inactivate the DNA
methyltransferases by oxidation of the catalytic-site
cysteine residue in the active site [25]. Since RRx-001
propagates runaway ROS in tumors [3], its inhibitory
effects on methylation and Dnmt activity may be at least
partly due to the excess accumulation of free radicals.

In this study, RRx-001 also increased acetylation
of histones H3 and H4, suggesting that RRx-001 is an
inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are compounds that
block the activity of Zn++-dependent HDACs, inducing
hyperacetylation of histones and other proteins [26].
Histone acetylation is associated with open chromatin
structure, and it is believed that the anti-cancer effects of
HDACi are in part due to the reactivation of suppressor

001, likely through activity on DNA methyltransferases
and histone deacetylases that contain redox-sensitive
active site cysteines. Similar to the diverse activity of the
DNA hypomethylators and HDAC inhibitors, which may
profoundly affect gene expression patterns in cancer, RRx001 induces pleiotropic antitumor effects. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that, in contrast to the traditional
“one drug one target” paradigm, RRx-001 has multi(epi)
target features that contribute to its anti-cancer activity and
may represent a single unifying mechanism accounting for
its broad range of antitumor effects.

genes. HDACs are also linked to the initiation and
maintenance of repression of DNA hypermethylated genes.
Romidepsin and vorinostat are two FDA-approved HDACi
for hematologic malignancies [27]. Since oxidative stress
has been linked to the inhibition of HDAC activity, which
promotes the acetylation of histones, it follows that the
RRx-001-induced hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4
may be associated with ROS formation [28].
Despite minimal activity as single agents, HDACi
have been shown to reverse chemoresistance [29].
Similarly, azacitidine sensitizes advanced cancers to
platinum therapy [30]. Decitabine is a forerunner in
epigenetic therapy and may overcome resistance to
molecular targeted therapy, induce cell reprogramming,
and elicit immune responses through epigenetic
modifications [20]. However, in a recent Phase II clinical
trial, decitabine reduced rather than increased efficacy of
carboplatin in partially platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer
[31]. Overall, these clinical proof-of-concept studies
to establish epigenetic therapies as multidrug resistantreversal agents have lacked consistency [10, 18].
Combination therapy with methyltransferase
inhibitors and HDACi may prove more efficacious than
treatment with either class of drug alone [32, 33]. For
example, azacytidine in combination with the HDACi,
entinostat, demonstrated evidence of efficacy in patients
with refractory non-small cell lung cancer, as well as
subsequent resensitization to previously refractory drugs
[34]. As a multi-targeted systemically non-toxic anticancer
agent with broad-spectrum activity on DNA methylation
and histone acetylation, RRx-001 has the properties of
an “all-in-one combination” epi-therapy without any of
the adverse effects of Dnmt or HDAC inhibitors. These
present findings add new facets to the known anticancer
activity of RRx-001.
The downstream action of RRx-001 on tumors first
involves an initial binding event to the beta-93 cysteine
residue of hemoglobin to form adducts in the red blood
cell [35, 36]. The conformational changes induced in
hemoglobin lead to an increase in oxidative stress within
the red blood cell, followed by deposition of denatured
hemoglobin on the membrane and other membrane effects
due to oxidative stress. Covalent binding of RRx-001 to
hemoglobin also increases the rate of nitrite reduction
to NO under hypoxia [37]. As the intermediaries of
cytotoxicity, RRx-001-modified red blood cells occlude
tumor microvasculature, are internalized by tumor
endothelial cells, and release heme, iron and lipids upon
catabolism inside the tumor. These redox-active heme
degradation products, membrane-free iron and lipids
derived from the RBC membrane mediate oxidative
damage in the tumor microenvironment. There is also
evidence that RRx-001 causes vascular normalization and
increases blood flow in tumors [38].
The results of our current study add epigenetic
modulation to the list of anti-cancer properties of RRxwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
RRx-001 was obtained from Orbital ATK. The DNA
methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. RRx-001 and 5-azacytidine
solutions were freshly prepared on the experimental day
by dissolving in DMSO and then diluting with cell culture
medium. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.025%.

fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/
ml streptomycin in a 37°C humidified incubator with a
mixture of 95% air and 5% CO2. Exponentially growing
cells were plated in 100-mm dishes with 5-10 x 105 cells
per dish in DMEM culture media and grown overnight.
Cells were treated with RRx-001, 5-azacytidine or 0.025%
DMSO as a vehicle control for one to three days. Media
containing RRx-001, 5-azacytidine, or DMSO were
replaced daily over the 3-day period.
