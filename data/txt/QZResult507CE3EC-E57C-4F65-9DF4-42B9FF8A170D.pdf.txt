ABSTRACT
Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to the development of liver fibrosis.
MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are found to act as regulators of the activation of hepatic stellate
cell (HSC) in liver fibrosis. However, whether miRNAs activate Wnt/β-catenin pathway
in activated HSCs during liver fibrosis is largely unknown. In this study, we found
that Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) treatment significantly inhibited liver fibrosis in CCl4treated rats, HSC-T6 cells and rat primary HSCs, resulting in the suppression of type

Ⅰcollagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin. Also, Sal B suppressed HSC activation
and cell proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, Sal B treatment induced the inactivation
of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, with an increase in P-β-catenin and Wnt inhibitory factor
1 (WIF1). We demonstrated that the anti-fibrotic effects caused by Sal B were, at
least in part, via WIF1. Moreover, our study revealed that miR-17-5p was reduced
in vivo and in vitro after Sal B treatment. As confirmed by luciferase activity assays,
WIF1 was a direct target of miR-17-5p. Notably, the suppression of HSCs induced
by Sal B was almost inhibited by miR-17-5p mimics. Collectively, we demonstrated
that miR-17-5p activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway to result in HSC activation through
inhibiting WIF1 expression.

INTRODUCTION

myofibroblast-like cells that are characterized by
expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA),
contributing to the progression of liver fibrosis [3].
Therefore, HSCs, the major mesenchymal cells in liver,
are widely accepted as playing a critically important role
in liver fibrosis [4]. However, the underlying molecular
mechanisms responsible for the proliferation and
activation of HSCs are still not completely understood.
Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to
be involved in the development of organ fibrosis including
liver fibrosis [5, 6]. Sustained Wnt/β-catenin pathway
activation contributes to HSC activation and mediates
HSC proliferation, resolution, and ECM accumulation
[5, 7, 8]. It has been demonstrated that Wnt antagonists

Liver fibrosis, a major cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide, represents the common responses of
the liver to infectious, toxic or metabolic agents and is a
big medical problem [1]. Liver fibrosis is characterized
by an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins in liver, mainly synthesized by activated hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs). The excess deposition of ECM
disrupts the normal architecture of the liver resulting in
pathophysiological damage to the organ, which eventually
undergoes the liver fibrosis-cirrhosis [2]. During liver
injury, quiescent HSCs are exposed to inflammatory
and profibrogenic factors, and transdifferentiate into

such as secreted Frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt
inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) and secreted Dickkopf (DKK)
family (DKK1-4) can attenuate hepatic fibrosis via
inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting Wnt/βcatenin pathway may be a novel therapeutic target in liver
fibrosis [9, 10].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 20-22 nucleotides
and act as negative regulators of gene expression
by inhibiting protein translation or inducing mRNA
degradation [11]. Growing evidence has demonstrated that
miRNAs are involved in the control of a wide range of
biological functions and processes such as development,
differentiation, metabolism, carcinogenesis, and immune
response [12]. HSCs could be activated or suppressed
by miRNAs, suggesting that miRNAs act as HSC
regulators in liver fibrosis. For instance, over-expression
of miR-146a suppresses transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-β)-induced HSC proliferation, and increases HSC
apoptosis via its target Smad4 [4]. Recently, miR-17-5p,
a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, is often up-regulated
in many malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) and functions as an oncogenic miRNA [13, 14].
MiR-17-5p is not only involved in cell functions such as
proliferation and migration but also a key regulator of the
G1/S phase cell cycle transition [15]. Our previous study
demonstrated that over-expression of miR-17-5p promotes
HSC proliferation and activation [16].
In China, traditional Chinese medicine is often
used to treat hepatic fibrosis because of patients’ trust
in traditional Chinese medicine. For example, Fuzheng
Huayu recipe (FZHY), a formula with anti-hepatic
fibrosis activity, is often used as an anti-liver fibrotic
product in China [17, 18]. It has been demonstrated that
Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae is the main effective herb
in FZHY. Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), one of the water
soluble components from Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae, has
good action against hepatic fibrosis in animal model and
patients with chronic hepatitis B [19, 20]. But so far, the
mechanisms for the anti-fibrotic effects of Sal B have not
been well elucidated.

that the increased α-SMA levels in CCl4-treated rats were
reduced by Sal B (P < 0.05, Figure 1B). Next, the effects
of Sal B on the mRNA and protein levels of α-SMA and
type I collagen were analyzed in rat liver tissues by realtime PCR and western blotting, respectively. Our results
showed that the increased levels of α-SMA and type I
collagen caused by CCl4 were inhibited by Sal B (Figure
1C and Figure 1D). To further investigate the anti-fibrotic
effects of Sal B in vitro, the levels of α-SMA and type
I collagen were analyzed in HSC-T6 cells and primary
HSCs after Sal B treatment. Compared with the control,
the levels of α-SMA and type I collagen were reduced by
Sal B in HSC-T6 cells (Figure 2D and Figure 2E). Similar
results were also observed in primary HSCs. As shown
in the MTT assay, the growth rate was reduced to 53.8%
and 65.6%, respectively, in Sal B-treated primary HSCs
and HSC-T6 cells compared to untreated cells (Figure
2F). These data confirmed that Sal B could inhibit liver
fibrosis.

Sal B induced the inactivation of Wnt/βcatenin pathway and the up-regulation of WIF1
expression
Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in
the development of organ fibrosis [22, 23]. To explore
whether Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in the
effects of Sal B on liver fibrosis, the protein levels of
P-β-catenin were detected in vivo and in vitro after Sal
B treatment. The results showed that Sal B caused a
significant increase in the phosphorylation of β-catenin
in CCl4-treated rats, HSC-T6 cells and primary HSCs
(Figure 1D and Figure 2E). Sal B treatment also resulted
in a reduced TCF activity in HSC-T6 and primary HSCs
(Figure 2C). To further study whether the suppression
of Wnt signaling caused by Sal B is associated with the
increased expressions of Wnt signaling inhibitors, the
mRNA expressions of Wnt signaling inhibitors including
WIF1, sFRP1, sFRP2 and DKK1-4, were detected in
CCl4-treated rats, HSC-T6 cells and primary HSCs after
Sal B treatment. It was found that the mRNA level of
WIF1 was increased by Sal B whereas others not (Figure
1C, Figure 2A and Supporting Information Figure S1).
Immunoblot analysis further confirmed that Sal B caused
an increase in WIF1 protein in vivo and in vitro (Figure 1D
and Figure 2B). Therefore, WIF1 was chosen for the next
experiments. These results indicated that Sal B caused the
suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway with an increase in
the levels of P-β-catenin and WIF1.

RESULTS
Sal B inhibited liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro
It has been demonstrated that Sal B can inhibit liver
fibrosis [20, 21]. To confirm the effects of Sal B on rat liver
fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), the degree
of rat liver fibrosis was determined by hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining and Masson staining. As indicated
by H&E and Masson staining, CCl4 caused prominent
hepatic steatosis, necrosis, and formation of regenerative
nodules in rat liver tissues, which was ameliorated by Sal
B (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemical results demonstrated

siRNA was transfected into HSC-T6 cells and primary
HSCs to silent WIF1. The blockade of WIF1 with WIF1
siRNA successfully inhibited the mRNA and protein levels
of WIF1 in HSC-T6 cells and primary HSCs (Figure 2A
and Figure 2B). Next, the TCF activity and the levels of
P-β-catenin in Sal B-treated cells with WIF1 siRNA were
examined. TCF reporter activity assay showed that the
TCF activity decreased by Sal B was reversed by WIF1

siRNA in HSC-T6 cells and primary HSCs (Figure 2C).
Moreover, the enhanced P-β-catenin levels caused by Sal
B were reversed by WIF1 siRNA (Figure 2E). Of note,
the effects of Sal B on the mRNA and protein levels of
α-SMA and type I collagen in HSCs were blocked down
by WIF1 siRNA (Figure 2D and Figure 2E). The reduction
of cell proliferation caused by Sal B treatment was also
blocked down by the silencing of WIF1 expression (Figure

2F). These findings demonstrated that WIF1 was involved
in the anti-fibrotic effect induced by Sal B.

17-5p promoted the activation of HSCs. Given that WIF1
was predicted as a putative target of miR-17-5p (Figure 5A
and Figure 5B), we hypothesized that miR-17-5p might
promote hepatic fibrosis via inhibiting WIF1 expression.
Next, the mRNA and protein levels of WIF1 were
examined in cells transfected with miR-17-5p mimics.
The results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels
of WIF1 were reduced by miR-17-5p mimics (Figure 3C
and Figure 3D). We also examined the effects of miR-175p inhibitor and the silencing of WIF1 on cell cycle. Cell
cycle analysis revealed that compared with the control,
miR-17-5p inhibitor suppressed a proportion of cells in
the S phase and increased the number of cells in the G0/
G1 phase, suggesting that miR-17-5p inhibitor contributed
to the inactivation of HSCs (Figure 3E). However, the
effects of miR-17-5p inhibitor on cell cycle were blocked
down by WIF1 siRNA (Figure 3E). Notably, as shown in
H&E and Masson staining, miR-17-5p inhibitor treatment
significantly suppressed liver fibrosis caused by CCl4
(Figure 4A). Immunohistochemical results additionally
confirmed that the levels of α-SMA increased in CCl4treated rats were attenuated by miR-17-5p inhibitor

MiR-17-5p was involved in Sal B effects and
promoted the activation of HSCs
To determine whether WIF1 expression is inhibited
by miRNAs, we searched for predictable miRNAs that
could bind with 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of rat WIF1
mRNA using microRNA.org (http://www.microrna.org/
microrna/home.do). As a result, miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR20a, miR-20b-5p, miR-21 and miR-199-5p were extracted
as candidates. The results showed that only miR-17-5p was
reduced in vivo and in vitro after Sal B treatment (Figure
3A and Supporting Information Figure S1). Therefore,
miR-17-5p was selected for further experiments. To
investigate the effects of miR-17-5p over-expression on
the activation of HSCs, immunofluorescence staining for
α-SMA and the HSC marker desmin was examined in
primary HSCs. We found that the levels of desmin (green)
and α-SMA (red) were increased by miR-17-5p overexpression (Figure 3B). These data indicated that miR-

WIF1 levels in Sal B-treated cells were additionally
reversed by miR-17-5p mimics. Moreover, the reduction
of TCF activity and cell proliferation rate induced by Sal B
were almost blocked down by miR-17-5p mimics (Figure
6C and Figure 6D). All these results indicated that the
reduction of miR-17-5p level in the treatment of Sal B
contributed to the suppression of activated HSCs and miR17-5p promoted the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway
via inhibiting WIF1 level.

treatment (P < 0.05, Figure 4B). All these results suggested
that miR-17-5p could promote the activation of HSCs via
the down-regulation of WIF1.

WIF1 is a target of miR-17-5p
To further investigate whether WIF1 is the direct
downstream target of miR-17-5p, the sequence of 3′UTR
of WIF1 mRNA target region was cloned into pMIRREPORTTM Luciferase plasmid (Figure 5A and Figure
5B). The construct was cotransfected into HSCs along with
miR-17-5p precursor or miRNA negative control (miRNC). β-gal reporter control plasmid was cotransfected to
monitor transfection efficiency. Our results showed that
miR-17-5p precursor significantly reduced luciferase
activity driven by the wild-type 3′UTR of WIF1 compared
to miR-NC in HSCs. Meanwhile, the luciferase activities
of mutated type WIF1 3′UTR and empty vector were not
inhibited by miR-17-5p precursor (Figure 5C). These
results confirmed that WIF1 was a direct target of miR17-5p.

DISCUSSION
Activation of HSCs to myofibroblast-like cells is the
pivotal event in the initiation and progression of hepatic
fibrosis [24]. HSC activation is characterized by enhanced
cell proliferation, over-production of ECM, and de novo
synthesis of α-SMA [25]. In this study, we found that Wnt/
β-catenin pathway was attenuated by Sal B via restoration
of WIF1 and inhibition of miR-17-5p, with a reduction
in TCF activity and an increase in P-β-catenin level.
Owing to the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, HSC
activation was inhibited, leading to the reduction of HSC
proliferation, ECM proteins and α-SMA expression. The
silencing of WIF1 blocked down the anti-fibrotic effects of
Sal B and WIF1 was a direct target of miR-17-5p. These
data revealed that Sal B suppresses HSC activation, at
least in part, through inhibiting miR-17-5p-activated Wnt/
β-catenin pathway.
It has been reported that HSC activation can be
suppressed by Sal B treatment. Wang et al. showed that
Sal B prevents the progression of liver angiogenesis and
alleviates liver fibrosis via NF-κB signaling [26]. Li et

MiR-17-5p activated HSCs via Wnt/β-catenin
pathway
Our previous study showed that WIF1 was a direct
target of miR-17-5p and the levels of miR-17-5p were
reduced by Sal B in HSCs. To further investigate whether
miR-17-5p is involved in the anti-fibrotic effects of Sal
B, we transfected miR-17-5p mimics into Sal B-treated
cells. The effects of Sal B on the levels of P-β-catenin,
α-SMA and type I collagen were attenuated by miR-17-

al. reported that Sal B may exert an anti-hepatic fibrosis
effect via down-regulating angiotensin II signaling in
HSC activation [20]. Another study demonstrated that
Sal B prevents HSC activation through TGF-β signaling
pathway, i.e. inhibiting TGF-β1 expression, activity of
TβR-I kinase and Smads phosphorylation [27]. In our
study, it was found that Sal B could inhibit HSC activation,
at least in part, via suppressing Wnt/β-catenin pathway. To
our knowledge, this is the first report to show that miR17-5p-activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in the
effects of Sal B.
MiR-17-5p was described as an oncogenic miRNA
in cancers. For example, Li et al. found that miR-17-5p
is able to enhance cell proliferation by promoting G1/S
transition of the cell cycle and suppressing apoptosis in
ovarian cancer cell lines [28]. Moreover, emerging studies
show that miR-17-5p over-expression promotes HCC
development and the inhibition of miR-17-5p results in
the suppression of HCC proliferation and migration [29,
30]. Notably, elevated serum miR-17-5p has also been
reported to correlate with the poor prognosis in HCC
patients [31]. In this study, miR-17-5p over-expression
increased the levels of α-SMA and desmin in primary
HSCs. Furthermore, miR-17-5p was involved in the
regulation of cell cycle and inhibited the effects of Sal
B on cell proliferation. Notably, the inhibition of miR17-5p suppressed CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. All the
data suggest that miR-17-5p over-expression contributes
to the activation of HSCs, which is also consistent with
our previous study [16]. We previously showed that
miR-17-5p promotes HSC proliferation and activation,
at least in part, via reduction of Smad7 [16]. Herein, we
demonstrated that WIF1 is a new target of miR-17-5p.
In addition, it was found that all the anti-fibrotic effects
of Sal B could be blocked down by miR-17-5p mimics.
Taken together, our data suggested that the activation
of HSCs was suppressed by Sal B via miR-17-5p and
WIF1 (Figure 7). However, the mechanism of the direct
regulation of miR-17-5p by Sal B still remains unclear and
further studies are warranted.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that Sal B downregulates miR-17-5p expression, leading to the restoration
of WIF1 and the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
which contributes to the suppression of activated HSCs.
Our results not only provide a new insight of the role of
miRNA-activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver fibrosis,
but also show a new anti-fibrotic mechanism of Sal B.

USA). Antibodies against α-SMA and GAPDH were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA).

Cell culture
Rat HSC-T6 cell line was obtained from Research
of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing,
China). Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and
maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. HSC-T6
cells and primary rat HSCs were both treated with 10
μmol/L Sal B for 48 h, which is a safe dose [27].

Isolation and culture of rat HSCs
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight,
400-500 g) were used for HSC isolation as described
previously [32]. The primary HSCs were studied at day
3 after isolation throughout all the studies. The purity of
cultures was confirmed by immunocytochemical staining
for α-SMA and the purity reached > 98%.

CCl4 liver injury model
Adult male Sprague-Dawley (180-220 g) rats
were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of
Wenzhou Medical University. Liver fibrosis was induced
by administration of 2 ml of CCl4/olive oil (1:1, v/v)/kg
body weight by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for
up to 6 weeks [33]. Thirty rats were randomly divided into
three groups, including olive oil, CCl4 plus oral phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and CCl4 plus oral Sal B (10 mg /
kg), respectively. The experimental protocol was approved
by the Institutional Animal Committee of Wenzhou
Medical College. All animals received care in accordance
with ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’.
Rats were sacrificed under anesthesia at the end of six
weeks and the livers were removed for further analysis.
The liver tissues were used for H&E staining and Masson
staining by fixation with 10 % formalin.

Lentivirus production and transfection
The lentiviral vector containing negative control
(Lenti-NC) and lentiviral miR-17-5p inhibitor (Lenti-miR17-5p-inhibitor) were obtained from Shanghai GeneChem.
Rats were treated with olive oil (n = 6), CCl4 (n = 6), CCl4
plus Lenti-NC (n = 6) and CCl4 plus Lenti-miR-17-5pinhibitor (n = 6). Lenti-miR-17-5p-inhibitor or Lenti-NC

RNA interference analysis

Quantitative real-time PCR

RNA interference experiments were performed
before the treatment of Sal B using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA oligonucleotides
against WIF1 or scrambled sequences (Table.S1) were
synthesized by Gene Pharma (Shanghai, China) and
transfected in HSC-T6 cell and primary HSCs for 48 h.

Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cells
using miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression
(Table.S1) was measured by real-time PCR using SYBR
Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka,
Japan). Moreover, the primers of alpha-1 (I) collagen
(Col1A1), α-SMA, GAPDH and U6 were designed
as described previously [37]. Expression of mature
miRNAs was detected using TaqMan MicroRNA Assay
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The GAPDH
and U6 snRNA levels were used to normalize the relative
abundance of mRNAs and miRNAs [38], respectively.

miRNA transfection
Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of
1×106 cells per well. Then, medium was replaced with
Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, USA) and cells were transfected
with miR-17-5p mimics (60 nM) and miR-NC (60 nM)
(GenePharma, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 for 48 h.
After 6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with
DMEM containing 10 % FBS.

Western blot analysis
Tissues and cells were lysed with ice-cold
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM
2-Mercaptoethanol, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol). Total
proteins were quantified and separated by SDS-PAGE.
Then western blot assay was performed as described
previously [39]. The levels of protein were normalized to
total GAPDH.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were seeded on 18-mm cover glasses and
fixed in an acetic acid: ethanol (1:3) solution for 5 min at
-20°C. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% goat and
horse serum/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Then, cells
were incubated with primary antibodies against α-SMA
or desmin (Abcam), followed by fluorescein-labeled
secondary antibody (1:50 dilution; Dianova) [34]. The
nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). The slides were washed twice with PBS, covered
with DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich), and examined with
confocal laser scanning microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) at 488 and 568 nm.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density
of 1×103 cells per well, then cells were transfected with
miR-17-5p mimics and miR-NC as described above. Cell
proliferation was determined by MTT assay according
to the instructions of a MTT cell proliferation assay kit
(Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). The optical
density was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader
(Bio-Rad 550, USA).

Immunohistochemistry

TCF reporter activity assay

Immunohistochemical staining was performed
on the sections (3 μm thick) from the liver tissues,
as described previously [35, 36]. Briefly, after
deparaffinization, hydration, and antigen retrieval, samples
were incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary antibody
against α-SMA (1:100) and then with a biotinylated
secondary antibody. α-SMA expression was visualized
by 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
staining. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin
before dehydration and mounting α-SMA-positive areas
within the fibrotic region were then observed. Quantitative
analysis was calculated from five fields for each liver slice.

Cells were transiently transfected with TOPFLASH
and FOPFLASH (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake
Placid, NY, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000. Twentyfour hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and
luciferase and Renilla luminescence were measured using
the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega,
Wisconsin, WI, USA) on a luminometer (BioTek
Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). TCF reporter activity
was presented as the ratio of firefly-to-Renilla luciferase
activity.

Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis, we performed Cell Cycle
Analysis Kit (Beyotime, China). Cells were fixed in 70
