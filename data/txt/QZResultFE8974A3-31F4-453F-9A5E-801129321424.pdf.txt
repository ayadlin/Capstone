Abstract
To understand the mechanisms of action of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, two related
pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), we applied a variety of ‘-omics’
techniques to the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and IMR32 cell lines: [1] kinase interaction
assays, [2] affinity competition on immobilized broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors, [3] affinity
chromatography on immobilized (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8, [4] whole genome transcriptomics
analysis and specific quantitative PCR studies, [5] global quantitative proteomics approach and
Western blot analysis of selected proteins. Altogether the results show that the major direct targets
of these two molecules belong to the CDKs (1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 12), DYRKs, CLKs, CK1s families. By

inhibiting CDK7, CDK9 and CDK12, these inhibitors transiently reduce RNA polymerase 2
activity, which results in down-regulation of a large set of genes. Global transcriptomics and
proteomics analysis converge to a central role of MYC transcription factors down-regulation.
Indeed CDK inhibitors trigger rapid and massive down-regulation of MYCN expression in MYCN
amplified neuroblastoma cells as well as in nude mice xenografted IMR32 cells. Inhibition of
casein kinase 1 may also contribute to the antitumoral activity of (R)-roscovitine and (S)-CR8.
This dual mechanism of action may be crucial in the use of these kinase inhibitors for the
treatment of MYC-dependent cancers, in particular neuroblastoma where MYCN amplification is
a strong predictor factor for high-risk disease.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Over 258 protein kinase inhibitors (low molecular weight compounds and antibodies) are
currently in clinical trials, primarily against cancers: 116 are in phase I, 82 in phase II, 37 in
phase III, and 23 have reached the market (1-4). Although most were initially targeted
against a specific protein kinase relevant to a specific disease, thorough selectivity studies
show that kinase inhibitors target multiple kinases (5-8). This suggests that the mechanisms
underlying their therapeutic effect are more likely due to a favorable combination of additive
effects on different kinases rather than to a specific action on a unique kinase target. There is
no strict correlation between target selectivity and therapeutic efficacy, advocating for the
multi-target inhibitor pharmacologic approach, as illustrated by selectivity studies performed
on marketed clinical kinase inhibitors (6-7, 9-10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Among the 518 human kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have received
considerable attention because of their fundamental involvement in many physiological
processes and in many diseases (11). Consequently, a large variety of pharmacological
inhibitors of CDKs have been identified, optimized and characterized (see reviews in
(12-18). Sixteen CDK inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. Among the first CDK
inhibitors are the purines olomoucine, roscovitine, purvalanol, and their analogues (reviews
in 14, 19). The most recent analogues include (S)-CR8 (20-22), N-&-N1 (23, 24), and others
(25-28). (R)-roscovitine (CYC202 or Seliciclib) is currently in late phase 2 clinical trial
against NSC lung cancer, breast and nasopharyngeal cancer (29-33). Roscovitine is
frequently used as a ‘selective’ inhibitor of CDKs in fundamental biological studies. Despite
its initial identification as a CDK inhibitor and its rather good selectivity compared to many
other kinase inhibitors also acting by competition with ATP binding at the catalytic site,
roscovitine also binds other protein targets (34, 35).
CR8 was developed recently as a more potent, ‘second generation’ analogue of roscovitine
(Figure 1) (20-22). Although it is slightly more potent (2-5 fold) at inhibiting the kinase
targets of roscovitine, it was found to be much more potent than roscovitine (50-100 fold) at
inducing apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell lines (20, 21). This suggests that the direct

targets of CR8 and roscovitine may differ, and that their mechanism of action might also be
different.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To understand and compare the cellular effects of roscovitine and CR8, we used a variety of
‘omics’ approaches to examine the effects of these drugs on the human neuroblastoma
SHSY5Y and IMR32 cell lines which were chosen as cellular models. Results show that
both molecules have a complex pattern of primary targets, that they mostly down-regulate
the expression of key genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, NFκB pathway,
etc... Nevertheless, global analysis points out towards a central role of c-MYC and MYCN
down-regulation in the action of these drugs. Both CDK inhibitors trigger rapid and massive
down-regulation of MYCN in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell lines either in culture
and when xenografted in nude mice. This data confirm and extend previous observations
showing the links between CDKs and MYC, as well as the favorable effects of CDK
inhibition on MYC-dependent cells (36-45), suggesting that MYC dependence may
constitute a selection criterion of cancer subgroups for treatment by CDK inhibitors. This is
of particular importance for neuroblastoma where MYCN amplification is invariably
associated with poor prognosis (review in 46-48). In addition roscovitine and CR8 inhibit
CK1ε, a target recently validated in MYC overexpressed context (49).

RESULTS
CR8 is a potent cell death inducer derived from roscovitine

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CR8 (Supplementary Figure S1) has been optimized as a second-generation derivative of
roscovitine (20-22). Although slightly more potent than roscovitine as an inhibitor of various
kinase targets, CR8 was found to be much more potent than its parent molecule at inducing
cell death in a variety of cells (average 71.2 fold higher potency on 6 cell lines in ref. 20;
average 58.5 fold higher potency on 9 neuroblastoma cell lines in ref. 22). To further
explore the differences in their potency the two compounds were tested in the NCI 60 tumor
cell lines panel. Results revealed an average 102, 31 and 15 fold higher potency of CR8 over
roscovitine as measured by GI50, TGI and LC50, respectively (Table 1; Supplementary
Figure S2). No specific tumor type was found to display hyper- or hypo-sensitivity to CR8.
In order to investigate and compare the intracellular mechanisms of action of both CDK
inhibitors in detail, we selected the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y (non-amplified
MYCN) and IMR32 (amplified MYCN) cell lines as representative tumor cell lines. To
investigate the effects of CR8 on cell cycle progression we exposed IMR32 cells to 5 μM
CR8 for 24 hr and analyzed the cell cycle phase distribution by FACS. The expected, yet
modest, increase in G2/M at the expense of G1 and S phase was observed (Figure 1A). We
also ran cell synchronization experiments and compared the effects of CR8 on G1 (obtained
by serum starvation), G2/M (obtained by nocodazole treatment) and asynchroneous, Log
phase IMR32 cells. Figure 1A confirmed the expected synchronization and displays the
effects of CR8. Dose-response curves showed that CR8 acts with equal potency at all cell
cycle stages in terms of cell death induction (Figure 1B).

Interactomics study of roscovitine and CR8. 1. Kinase interaction screen

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The molecular targets of roscovitine have been quite extensively studied by various methods
including screening on various panels of purified kinases (29, 34, 35, 50, 20), yeast three
hybrid screens (51), interaction assays (6) and affinity chromatography (34). Various
methods have shown that CR8 and roscovitine display an apparently similar specificity, with
slightly enhanced activity of CR8 compared to roscovitine on CDKs (2-4 fold) and CK1
(7-10 fold) (20). To investigate and compare the molecular targets of roscovitine and CR8
using global approaches, we first made use of the DiscoveRx KinomeScan® assay (402
kinases) (7) (Supplementary Figure S3; Table 2; Supplementary Table S1). Results show
that the main targets of both compounds belong to the CK1 (casein kinase 1), CDK, CLK
(cdc2 like kinase) and DYRK (dual specificity, tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase)
families of kinases (Table 2). Interestingly, CK1ε (CSNK1ε) appeared as the first interaction
target for both compounds among the 402 kinases.
Interactomics study of roscovitine and CR8. 2. Affinity chromatography

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To evaluate the scope and nature of the direct targets of roscovitine and CR8, we used an
affinity chromatography method successfully exploited previously with other CDK
inhibitors (52, 53, 34; Oumata et al., in preparation). Each compound was immobilized on
agarose beads through a linker. The position of the linker on the inhibitor was selected on
the basis of the inhibitors’ interactions and orientation in the CDK2 (34, 20, 54) and CDK9
(22) ATP-binding sites, as revealed by kinase/inhibitor co-crystal structures. Extracts of
human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells were run on the immobilized inhibitors,
the beads were extensively washed and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE
followed by silver staining (Figures 2A, 2B). Individual protein bands were cut from the
stained gels and proteins were identified following mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments
(34). Results are provided in Figures 2A, 2B (kinases) and in Supplementary Table S2 (all
protein targets). Although many targets were common for both drugs in these two cell lines
(and in other tissues and cell types not reported here), CR8 appeared to bind more proteins
than roscovitine.
Interactomics study of roscovitine and CR8. 3. Competition affinity chromatography

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A third approach was used to analyze the kinase targets of roscovitine and CR8. This
method is based on an affinity matrix comprising a set of well-characterized broad-spectrum
kinase inhibitors (KinAffinity® developed by Evotec) to enrich the subproteome of
endogenously expressed kinases of cells or tissues. Kinase inhibitors are screened against
these matrix-bound proteins to reveal the inhibitor's quantitative cellular kinase profile.
First, a lysate of SILAC-labeled SH-SY5Y cells was applied to KinAffinity® beads adjusted
to different concentrations. These quantitative binding experiments allow determining the
concentration of the immobilized compounds required to obtain 50% binding of each target
protein to the matrix (BC50). Second, a lysate of SILAC-labeled SH-SY5Y cells was applied
to 10-fold diluted KinAffinity® beads in the presence of increasing concentrations of free
roscovitine or CR8. These quantitative competition experiments determine the free
compound concentration required for 50% target protein to remain bound to the matrix
(CC50). The final Kd,free values for the free compound were calculated for each target

protein using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (55). A total of 184 distinct protein kinases were
enriched from SH-SY5Y cells (Supplementary Table S3A). Targets were ranked according
to their affinities with Kd values ranging from 0.081 up to 30 μM (Table 3; Figures 2C, 2D;
Supplementary Tables S3B and S3C). A total of 18 and 20 target kinase proteins (i.e. Kd
values <30 μM) were identified in SH-SY5Y cells for roscovitine and CR8, respectively
(Table 3). Of these, 4 and 6 were protein targets specific to roscovitine and CR8,
respectively, and 14 were shared by both drugs (Supplementary Tables S3B and S3C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Whereas roscovitine displayed the highest affinities (five best Kd values) for PAK4, CDK7,
CDK12 (CRK7), CDK9 and CK1δ, CR8 displayed the highest affinity for CDK12, CDK9,
MSK2, CK1δ and CDK10. Furthermore, several other protein kinases involved in regulation
of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, alternative splicing and neuronal functions (CK1ε,
CLK2, DYRK1A or CDK5) were also identified as roscovitine and CR8 targets. Other
proteins detected on the matrix, such as cyclin T1, T2, K, H and B2, are likely to bind
indirectly, through their CDK7, CDK9, CDK1 partners. This is illustrated by the very
similar Kd values of partner proteins (CDK7/cyclin H/MAT1 or CDK9/cyclin T1). Finally,
several phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4 kinases were identified as CR8 targets. The
previously identified roscovitine target pyridoxal kinase (PDXK) (35) is expressed in SHSY5Y cells and bound to the KinAffinity® matrix, yet it was not competed by roscovitine or
CR8. This might be explained by the characteristic composition of the KinAffinity® matrix,
which exclusively contains broad spectrum kinase inhibitors that bind their target kinases
via the ATP-binding site. Since roscovitine is not directly binding at the PDXK ATP site,
but at the pyridoxal site, displacement of PDXK from a matrix comprising ATP-competitive
compounds might not occur. Alternatively, PDXK may bind very poorly to the
KinAffinity® matrix.
Transcriptomics study of roscovitine and CR8

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As a global approach to comparatively investigate the effects of roscovitine and CR8, we
next performed a parallel transcriptomics study for both compounds. SH-SY5Y cells were
exposed for 4 hrs to 50 μM roscovitine, 5 μM CR8 or the corresponding level of DMSO
vehicle. mRNAs were extracted, purified, reverse-transcribed and the products hybridized
on 44K Human Whole-Genome Agilent Technologies chips. The transcriptome was
analyzed using the GeneSpring and DAVID software. Results show that, after 4 hrs,
roscovitine and CR8 altered (>2 fold) the expression of 1,523 and 1,138 genes, respectively
(Figure 3A). Most altered genes were down-regulated (1,321 and 1,037 for roscovitine and
CR8, respectively) (Figure 3B), although a few were up-regulated (202 and 101,
respectively) (Figure 3C). All down-regulated and up-regulated genes are listed in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5. An EASE analysis of these down-regulated and upregulated genes is shown in Supplementary Tables S6 and S7, respectively. Table S8 shows
down-regulated genes which are direct roscovitine/CR8 targets, cell cycle, apoptosis or
NFκB regulators. Genes showing a >10 fold down-regulation, following exposure to
roscovitine or CR8 are listed in Table 4. To confirm the validity of this study, we verified
the effects of the two drugs on the transcription of a selection of genes using straight PCR
(Figure 3D) or quantitative PCR (Figure 3E): CDK7, GSG2 (haspin), c-MYC, p27Kip1,
ING1, SIAH1, NEDD9, and actin or GAPDH as controls. Starting from the same number of

cells, and measuring expression after a short exposure time, probably allows the use of
housekeeping genes to normalize the data; this might not have been the case for longer
exposure times and in situations where total expression of a large number of mRNAs is
altered, and when higher levels of mRNAs might be present as seen in MYC overexpressing
cells (56). In our case SH-SY5Y do not show overexpression of MYCN and thus mRNA
quantification may reflect the reality. This might not have been the case with IMR32 cells
which overexpress MYCN. Results confirmed those obtained in the Agilent global
approach, notably the massive down-regulation of c-MYC expression. The potential
importance of the effects of the two compounds on Myc expression was highlighted by
global analysis of the expression data which showed a convergence on Myc (Supplementary
Figure S4).
Proteomics study of roscovitine and CR8

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next used a global quantitative proteomics approach to investigate the effects of
roscovitine and CR8. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed for 8 hrs to 50 μM roscovitine, 5 μM
CR8, the corresponding level of DMSO vehicle, or left untreated. Cells were pelleted and
stored frozen until further processing. Proteins were extracted and subjected to trypsin
proteolysis. The resulting tryptic peptides were then labeled with iTRAQ, and all samples
were pooled prior to LC-MS analysis. A total of 18,193 peptides corresponding to 1,320
proteins were identified and quantified (Figure 4A-C; Supplementary Tables S9, S10).
Roscovitine triggered down-regulation of substantially more proteins than CR8 (226 versus
41). Expression of 25 proteins was altered by both compounds. Once again, global analysis
of the protein expression data showed a convergence on MYC (Supplementary Figure S4).
We next analyzed the effects of the two drugs on the levels of a selection of proteins
(encoded by genes which showed down-regulation in the transcriptomics study) by Western
blotting with appropriate antibodies (Figure 4D, 4E). SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to
various concentrations (Figure 4D) or different durations (Figure 4E) to roscovitine or CR8.
Cells were extracted and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Results
confirmed dose- and time-dependent down-regulation of proteins like c-MYC and p27KIP1,
while a few proteins, like GSG2 (haspin), which showed down-regulation at the mRNA
level (Figure 4D, 4E), did not show any significant down-regulation at the protein level,
illustrating the only partial coupling between mRNA and protein levels.

CDK inhibitors down-regulate MYCN expression
Given that the data strongly support the conclusion that MYC is down-stream target of CDK
inhibition, and the importance of MYC in the development of poor prognosis neuroblastoma
(46-48), we decided to focus our attention to the effects of CR8 on MYCN in neuroblastoma
cells. MYCN is a rapid turnover protein as demonstrated by the use of MG132, a
proteasome inhibitor, and cycloheximide (CHX), a global inhibitor of protein synthesis.
Inhibition of proteasome leads to rapid accumulation of MYCN while protein synthesis
inhibition leads to rapid MYCN down-regulation (Figure 5A). Exposure to CR8 leads to a
rapid (less than 6 hrs) down-regulation of MYCN in IMR32 cells (Figure 5B). We next
tested the effects of CR8 on the stability of MYCN in nine different neuroblastoma cell lines
(Figure 5C), six of which showing massive amplification of MYCN and three without

detectable MYCN expression, although these three cell lines express c-myc. Exposure to
CR8 resulted in a dose-dependent and essentially complete disappearance of MYCN in all
six MYCN amplified cell lines. Among the three non-amplified MYCN cell lines, CR8
triggered c-Myc down-regulation only in SH-SY5Y cells. No difference in the time-course
of MYCN down-regulation induced by CR8 was seen between asynchroneous, G1
synchronized (serum starvation) and G2/M synchronized (nocodazole treatment) IMR32
cells, suggesting that the cell cycle stage is not a key factor in CR8's action (data not
shown).
MYCN down-regulation is associated with inhibition of CDKs rather than of other targets

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MYCN down-regulation was also induced by CDK inhibitors other than CR8 and
roscovitine (Figure 6): MR4 (unpublished), N-&-N1 (23, 24), purvalanol A (57),
SCH727965 (58), AT7519 (59), SNS-032 (60) and flavopiridol (61), but not by N6-methylCR8 and N6-methylroscovitine (the kinase inactive derivatives of CR8 and roscovitine,
respectively) (35). Besides CDKs, roscovitine and CR8 interact with a few other kinases as
shown above and earlier (20, 34, 35). To examine whether interaction with any of these
targets might account for the induction of MYCN down-regulation by CDK inhibitors, we
made use of a series of selective pharmacological inhibitors of these other kinases (none of
these inhibit CDKs) (Figure 6). IMR32 cells were exposed to various concentrations of
pharmacological inhibitors of DYRK1A (Leucettine 41 (62, 63), harmine (63), CLKs
(TG003) (64), CK1 (IC261 (65), DRF053 (25), D4476 (66)), and MEK1 (UO126,
PD098059 (67)). In contrast to a general kinase inhibitor (staurosporine (68)), none of these
inhibitors induced down-regulation of MYCN. Despite preferential interaction of roscovitine
and CR8 with CK1, none of the reported CK1 inhibitors triggered MYCN down-regulation.
These results suggest that CR8 and roscovitine, and other CDK inhibitors, trigger MYCN
down-regulation through inhibition of CDKs rather than by interaction with secondary
targets.
CDK8 reduces IMR32 tumor growth and down-regulates tumor MYCN in xenografts

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next tested the effects of CR8 on tumor growth and MYCN expression following
IMR32 engraftment in immunocompromised mice (Figure 7). IMR32 xenografts were
developed by subcutaneously injecting cells, either in suspension (Figure 7A) or in a
Matrigel/cell slurry (Figure 7B), into the flank of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Once
tumor growth was established, mice were randomly distributed in two groups and treated
with either vehicle (DMSO/PEG300/water, 5/50/45) or CR8 (2 mg/mL in vehicle). Vehicle
and drug were administered daily by intraperitoneal injection. Tumor growth was monitored
regularly and tumor volumes, based on caliper measurements, were calculated as described
in ref. 69. Results clearly show that CR8 slows down tumor growth (Figures 7A, 7B). When
the CR8-resistant tumors were left out, tumor growth was clearly arrested and in fact tumor
regression was observed (Figure 7B). To confirm the effect of CR8 on MYCN expression,
tumors were collected at the end of the xenograft experiments, extracts were prepared and
equal protein content samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels, followed by Western
blotting (Figure 7C). Anti-actin antibodies confirmed roughly equal protein loading of all 20
samples. Anti-MYCN antibodies confirmed that all control tumors expressed high levels of
MYCN. In contrast, most but not all CR8 treated tumors showed complete disappearance or

at least massive down-regulation of MYCN expression (Figure 7C). Mcl-1 and CK1ε were
also down-regulated as a result of exposure of mice to CR8 (data not shown), as expected
from the effects of CDK inhibitors on Mcl-1 expression (22) and the correlation between
MYCN overexpression and CK1ε expression (49).

DISCUSSION
In vitro targets of roscovitine and CR8
In this study we have investigated in detail the selectivity of the kinase inhibitory purines
roscovitine and CR8. Firstly, catalytic assays and interaction assays performed with
recombinant protein kinases confirm and extend previously known data for roscovitine (6, 9,
20, 34, 50, 51) and CR8 (20). Both compounds show affinity for sub-classes of CDKs,
namely CDK1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, but also DYRKs (1A, 1B), CLKs (1, 2, 4) and CK1s (ε, γ).
Strikingly, CK1ε appears to be one of the best targets of the two compounds.
Native targets of roscovitine and CR8

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There are limitations associated with the use of recombinant kinases in selectivity assays:
lack of natural post-translational modifications, lack of interacting partners, abnormal
folding of an unknown proportion of the produced kinases, use of excess amounts of
kinases, lack of competition between different targets, limitation to the cloned kinases, etc...
Therefore, we investigated the native targets of roscovitine and CR8 in neuroblastoma cell
lines using two affinity chromatography approaches (Figure 2, Table 3, Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3). These approaches provide a global view of potential targets (kinases/
non-kinases) of roscovitine and CR8 from a given cell line/ tissue. Results confirm
previously identified targets such as the above mentioned CDKs, CK1s (CK1ε in particular),
CLKs, DYRKs, pyridoxal kinase. They also point towards new potential targets such as
PAK4, CDK10, CDK12 and associated cyclin K (70-74), FADK1 and
phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (CR8). Inhibition of the catalytic activity of
these kinases has to be confirmed in vitro. Using the same competition affinity method with
mouse brain or K562 leukemia cells extracts, we also identified PAK4, CDK7, CDK9,
CDK12, DYRK1A, CK1δ, CK1ε and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (CR8) as
targets (unpublished). A number of non-kinase proteins were found to bind to roscovitineand CR8-beads (non-specific binders, direct or indirect interactors or kinase substrates?).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Down-stream targets of roscovitine and CR8
Investigating native targets from specific cell lines or tissues has limitations too: dependence
on target expression which varies in different cell lines or tissues, prevalence of the most
abundantly expressed proteins, preponderance of soluble targets. It is likely that cellular
responses to roscovitine and CR8 are the end result of a complex pattern of interactions with
the targets identified in vitro. In the context of anti-cancer activity towards c-MYC/MYCN driven tumors, we believe that the main action of roscovitine and CR8 can be explained by a
combined action on two sets of targets: the transcription regulating CDKs (CDK7/cyclin H/
MAT1, CDK9/cyclin T and CDK12/cyclin K) and the closely related CK1δ and CK1ε.

CDK7, CDK9 and CDK12 regulate RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and activity
(70-77). We therefore focused our work towards analysis of down-stream targets, namely
transcription and protein expression products. Global transcriptomics and proteomics
approaches showed that the two kinase inhibitors inhibit transcription and protein
expression, especially that of short-lived mRNAs and proteins, respectively, extending
earlier results obtained with other cell lines (74-76). One example is the cell survival factor
Mcl-1, which is rapidly down-regulated (22). Another key example investigated here are
members of the MYC transcription factors, and in particular MYCN. MYCN is frequently
amplified in neuroblastoma (46-48) and this event, in association with ALK mutations
(81-85), is associated with poor prognosis. MYCN has a short-lived RNA and is a shortlived protein (Figure 5). We here show that roscovitine and CR8 induce rapid and essentially
complete down-regulation of MYCN expression (Figure 5-7). We believe that roscovitine
and CR8, by inhibiting, even transiently, CDK7/cyclin H, CDK9/cyclin T and CDK12/
cyclin K, reduce RNA polymerase II activity, leading to an arrest of MYCN synthesis under
continued degradation conditions. This results in rapid clearance of the MYCN protein and
down-regulation of MYCN downstream targets. This fast and complete MYCN downregulation has been shown at the protein level in various neuroblastoma cell lines (Figure 5,
6) as well as in tumors grown in animal models (Figure 7). CDK2 inhibition has also been
reported as synthetically lethal to MYCN (37-39, 41, 43-45). One possibility is that CDK2
acts by phosphorylating and activating CDK9 (86). Another recently described mechanism
is the CDK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the SCFFBXO28 ubiquitin ligase
which promotes MYC-driven transcription and tumour development (45). Besides the CDK
inhibitors described here, two other types of drugs have been described to down-regulate
MYC /MYCN: the Aurora kinase inhibitor CCT137690 (87) - Aurora has been reported to
stabilize MYCN (40) - and BET bromodomain inhibitors (88, 89). These pharmacological
treatments might be additive with CDK inhibitors.

Expression of CK1ε correlates with MYCN amplification as well as c-MYC expression in
neuroblastoma (49). CK1ε inhibition is synthetically lethal with c-MYC and MYCN (49).
Pharmacological inhibitor (IC261) and siRNAs of CK1ε prevent growth of MYCNamplified xenografts (49). CK1 inhibitors (IC261, DRF053 and D4476) clearly do not
down-regulate MYCN expression (Figure 6). However CR8 was found to down-regulate the
expression of CK1ε (data not shown), suggesting that this effect could be down-stream of
MCYN down-regulation. The fact that one of the main targets of roscovitine and CR8 is
CK1ε (and the related CK1δ) suggests that this mechanism of action probably combines
with CDK inhibition to generate anti-tumor activity of roscovitine and CR8 in MYCNamplified tumors.
Altogether these results suggest that roscovitine and CR8, and probably other related purine
inhibitors, display anticancer activity thanks to a combination of two different and additive
effects: inhibition of CDK2, CDK7, CDK9, CDK12 and inhibition of CK1δ/ε. CDK
inhibition but not CK1 inhibition leads to the down-regulation of MYC and MCl-1. The
molecular events downstream to CK1 inhibition remain to be identified. MYCN
overexpressing tumors are particularly sensitive to these CDK/CK1 inhibitors that might be
favorably combined with ALK inhibitors for the treatment of poor prognosis neuroblastoma.
These results might be expanded to the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor,

Figure 3. Transcriptomics studies. A-C. Overall effects of roscovitine and CR8 on gene
expression in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were exposed for 4 h to either 50 μM roscovitine, 5 μM CR8 or corresponding
amounts of DMSO. mRNAs were extracted, purified, reverse-transcribed, amplified, labeled
with cyanine-3 CTP dyes, followed by hybridization on Agilent 4x44 K human whole
genome slides. Results were analyzed as described in the Material & Methods section. (A)
Altered expression (>2 fold) versus non-altered expression (<2 fold) of gene probes:
expression of 728 probes (corresponding to 572 genes) was changed specifically by
roscovitine, expression of 263 probes (187 genes) was altered specifically by CR8 and
expression of 1,108 probes (951 genes) was modified in common by both compounds.
93.33% of all probes displayed no change in expression level following treatment. Gene
expression was either down-regulated (B) or up-regulated (C): numbers in parentheses
indicate the total number of genes affected by roscovitine or CR8 treatment. The numbers of
genes displaying modified expression only in roscovitine treated cells, only in CR8 treated
cells or by both treatments are shown in blue, red and black, respectively. Percentages
indicate the proportion of these genes relative to the total of genes down- or up-regulated by
roscovitine or CR8 treatment. For example, roscovitine induces a >2 fold down-regulation
of 1,321 genes, 429 of which (32.5%) are specific to roscovitine treatment, while 892 genes
(67.5%) are also down-regulated by CR8 treatment. CR8 induces a >2 fold down-regulation
of 1,037 genes, 145 of which (14%) are specific to CR8 treatment, while 892 genes (86%)
are also down-regulated by roscovitine treatment. D, E. Selected examples of down-

by electrophoresis on agarose. Expression of actin and GAPDH mRNA was used as a
reference. Ctrl, no mRNA. (E). Quantitative PCR was also performed with p27Kip1, CDK7,

Cells were exposed for 4 h to either 50 μM roscovitine, 5 μM CR8 or corresponding
amounts of DMSO. Proteins were extracted, trypsinized, iTRAQ labeled, and samples
mixed prior to mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 18,193 peptides corresponding to
1,320 proteins were identified and quantified, of which 18.03% showed a >2 fold change in
