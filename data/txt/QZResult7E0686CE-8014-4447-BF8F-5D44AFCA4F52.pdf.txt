Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in
adults. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), can attenuate tumor-associated edema and improve patient
symptoms but based on magnetic resonance imaging, is associated with nonenhancing tumor progression and possibly gliosarcoma differentiation. To gain insight
into these findings, we investigated the role of hypoxia and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-associated proteins in GBM. Tumor markers of hypoxia and EMT
were upregulated in bevacizumab-treated tumors from GBM patients compared to
untreated counterparts. Exposure of glioma cells to 1% oxygen tension increased
cell proliferation, expression of EMT-associated proteins and enhanced cell migration
in vitro. These phenotypic changes were significantly attenuated by pharmacologic
knockdown of hypoxia-inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) or HIF2α, indicating that HIFs
represent a therapeutic target for mesenchymal GBM cells. These findings provide
insights into potential development of novel therapeutic targeting of angiogenesisspecific pathways in GBM.

vascular cancers, GBMs express high levels of VEGF,
particularly in areas of necrosis and hypoxia [5, 6]. The
increased levels of VEGF expression and vascular density
in GBM make angiogenesis an attractive therapeutic
target. Clinical trials have demonstrated that bevacizumab
is a therapeutic option for recurrent GBM patients who
have failed previous radiation and chemotherapy [3, 7].
Angiogenesis inhibitors, including bevacizumab,
produce demonstrable transient clinical and radiological
benefits for patients with a variety of cancer types
including GBM [8]. However, in 40 to 60% of cases,
initial responses are frequently followed by dramatic
progression of disease [2, 9]. Consequently, overall
survival has not been significantly improved with antiangiogenic therapy and is associated with an increased rate
of transformation to secondary gliosarcoma [2-4, 9, 10].
Recent data indicate that resistance to bevacizumab antiangiogenic therapy can be due to evasive (upregulation
of alternative pro-angiogenic pathways) or intrinsic
(genomic constitution) changes within the neoplasm [11].
These findings potentially make combinatorial strategies,
specifically integration of both anti-angiogenic therapy
and anti-resistance mechanisms, particularly attractive for
managing GBM.
Critical to a deeper understanding of the
pathobiology of therapeutic resistance and progression
will be insights into the effects of anti-angiogenic
therapy in GBM. To better understand the mechanisms
that underlie tumor cell invasiveness and progression
of disease during/following anti-angiogenic therapy, we
examined the phenotypic changes of GBM cells in the
setting of induced hypoxia. Specifically, bevacizumabinduced inhibition of VEGF can trigger intratumoral
hypoxia and initiate compensatory survival pathways,
namely upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)
[12]. Data indicate that HIF stabilization enhances tumor
cell invasion, cell growth and cell survival and thus serves
a critical role in modulating tumor aggression [13-22].
This may underlie the clinical and radiographic findings
associated with anti-angiogenic therapy in GBM patients.
Based on the emerging clinical and imaging findings
in recurrent GBM patients treated with bevacizumab, we
hypothesized that the lack of improved overall survival in
these patients is modulated through the activation of HIFmediated survival pathways. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed expression levels of HIF down-stream effectors
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers as well
as microfluidic invasion assays of GBM cells under
normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, glioma cell
phenotype and migration were analyzed following HIF
inhibition and gain-of-function to investigate the role of
HIFs in tumor cell aggressiveness/progression. Finally,
these findings were correlated with comprehensive
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of recurrent GBM
patients treated with bevacizumab via comparative
analysis of tumor tissue before and after treatment.

Hypoxia and mesenchymal transition in human
GBM after anti-angiogenic therapy
Bevacizumab treatment of recurrent GBM is
commonly associated with a decrease in intratumoral
enhancement and peri-tumoral edema. The reduction
in edema results in alleviation of tumor-associated
symptoms (Fig. 1a). However, these effects are transient
and the tumor eventually becomes refractory to therapy,
demonstrates increased infiltration of surrounding brain.
and is associated with transformation to gliosarcoma [10].
To test the hypothesis that anti-angiogenic therapy can
induce an EMT-like process through hypoxia in GBM,
we analyzed tumor tissues from three recurrent GBM
patients for markers of hypoxia and EMT before and after
bevacizumab treatment. Tumor histology from Patient
1 was most consistent with GBM before bevacizumab
therapy but showed histologic changes consistent with
transformation to gliosarcoma after treatment (Fig. 1b).
Tumor tissues revealed markedly elevated expression of
HIF1α and EMT markers Slug and Snail (diffuse pattern),
suggesting that the hypoxic microenvironment activated
an EMT-like process post-bevacizumab therapy.
Brains from Patients 2 and 3 were examined
postmortem. While both patients received radiation and
temozolomide chemotherapy, Patient 3 also received
bevacizumab (Fig. 1c). Compared to the tumor from
Patient 2, the bevacizumab-treated tumor (Patient 3)
exhibited a marked increase in cellularity, cell proliferation
and
spindle-shaped
mesenchymal
morphology.
Furthermore, the bevacizumab-treated tumor contained
significantly more tumor cells that stained for the EMT
markers matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), Zinc-finger
E box-binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1), Zeb2, Snail, Slug and
Twist. Sections taken 5 cm away from the tumor mass
revealed occasional single infiltrating tumor cells positive
for Ki67 and each of the EMT markers, but the scarce
number of infiltrating cells precluded any between-tumor
comparisons.

Hypoxia enhances GBM cell proliferation
Given that antiangiogenic therapy can be associated
with induction of a hypoxic phenotype and development
of gliosarcoma, we hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia
would enhance proliferation and mesenchymal change in
GBM cell lines. U87 and U251 human GBM cells and C6
rat glioma cells were cultured in 21%, 1% or 0.2% oxygen
for 24 or 48 hours. Expression of the HIF target genes
coding for erythropoietin (EPO), vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGFA), endothelin 1 (EDN1) and
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) were markedly increased

in both a time- and oxygen concentration-dependent
manner, demonstrating robust activation of hypoxia
signaling (Fig. 2, Fig. S1). Alternatively, expression of HIF
targets was reduced by knockdown of HIF1α or HIF2α
using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or pharmacologic
inhibition (demonstrative of a robust blockade of HIF
transcriptional activity).
To assess the effect of hypoxia on glioma cell
proliferation, cell proliferation assays on glioma cells
exposed to various oxygen concentrations for 24 or 48
hours were performed (Fig. 3). Under 1% oxygen tension,
hypoxia reliably doubled the proliferative capacity of
all glioma cell lines tested. This effect was reduced
by pharmacological inhibition of HIF1α and HIF2α.

Notably, inhibition of HIF2α more potently inhibited cell
proliferation at 24 hours, but this effect was diminished
by 48 hours. However, incubation at a very low oxygen
concentration had the opposite effect with cell proliferation
decreasing by roughly 50% at both time points. Consistent
with a regulatory role for HIFs in GBM cell proliferation
under hypoxic conditions, treatment with a HIF inhibitor
partially rescued cell proliferation. Glioma cells exposed
to 0.2% oxygen for 48 hours and incubated with the
HIF2α inhibitor demonstrated very similar proliferative
capacity to cells incubated under normoxic conditions.
Consequently, the effect of hypoxia on glioma cell
proliferation is both time- and concentration-dependent.

in the number of spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells. The tumor bed also demonstrated an increase in the number of cells positive for the
EMT inducers Zeb1, Zeb2, Slug, Snail, Twist and the EMT marker matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Stains performed on sections five
centimeters from the tumor bed revealed periodic single infiltrating cells that were often positive for each of the EMT inducers, but no
discernible difference was seen between the tumors. Magnification 400 ×.

effect was reduced by treatment with a HIF inhibitor. This
effect did not appear to differ between HIF1α and HIF2α.
Mesenchymal transition is governed by a defined
set of transcription factors including Slug, Snail and
Twist that repress genes coding for cell adhesion
proteins, increase expression of MMPs and increase
cell motility. To assess the effect of hypoxia on the
expression of these transcription factors, we measured
mRNA levels of Slug, Snail, Twist, MMP2 and MMP9
under various oxygen concentrations for 24 or 48 hours
(Fig. 4c and S2). Exposure to either 0.2% or 1% oxygen
saturation consistently upregulated genes associated with
EMT in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion,
demonstrating robust activation of the EMT program
under hypoxia. Upregulation of EMT inducers and MMPs
was consistently reduced following siRNA-mediated

To test the hypothesis that hypoxia induces
mesenchymal change in glioblastoma, we evaluated the
expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin using
immunofluorescence under various oxygen concentrations
at 24 or 48 hours (Fig. 4a and 4b). Low levels of vimentin
were detected under normoxic conditions in each of
the cell lines evaluated, indicating some degree of
mesenchymal change at baseline. At 24 hours, there was
no appreciable change in vimentin expression under 1%
oxygen concentration, and a slight increase was detected
under 0.2% oxygen in U251 cells only. However, hypoxia
consistently upregulated vimentin at 48 hours, indicating
an oxygen concentration- and time-dependent acceleration

knockdown of HIF1α or HIF2α and after treatment with a
HIF1α or HIF2α inhibitor.
To determine the time course of EMT-associated
protein expression under hypoxia, immunoblots against
Twist, Slug, MMP2 and MMP9 were assessed (Fig. 4d
and S3). Each investigated target was expressed at high
levels at baseline, indicating EMT inducers are present
in glioma cell lines under normal conditions. Despite
transcriptional upregulation of each target at less than 24
hours of hypoxia, there was no consistent change in Twist,
MMP2 or MMP9 expression at 24 hours. However, at 48
hours under hypoxia, each EMT-associated protein was
upregulated, and expression was blocked by treatment
with a HIF inhibitor. These findings indicate that hypoxia
enhances the expression of proteins that induce EMT and
expression of these proteins is subject to inhibition by
pharmacologic blockade of HIFs.

Mesenchymal transformation confers cells with
enhanced migratory ability and is consistent with findings
of diffuse spread of non-enhancing GBM on magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging. To investigate whether hypoxiainduced mesenchymal transformation of glioma cells
results in a migratory phenotype, we evaluated U87
GBM cell migration using a microfluidic chip invasion
assay under 21% or 1% oxygen saturation (Fig. 5a). For
this assay, cells were plated on a two-dimensional main
channel, and invasive cells were allowed to migrate
into a three-dimensional collagen matrix that more
accurately simulated the microenvironment of the cell.
Immunofluorescence was then performed to determine
the expression of HIF1α, HIF2α and vimentin in
migrated cells. Hypoxia significantly enhanced tumor cell

inhibitor, HIF2α inhibitor, non-targeting siRNA (nt-siRNA), HIF1α-siRNA or HIF2α-siRNA, as indicated. Hypoxia increased the distance
and number of vimentin-positive cells that migrated onto the collagen surface. Total migration was significantly reduced after treatment
with a HIF inhibitor and attenuated following HIF knockdown by siRNA. Treatment with a HIF2 inhibitor or siRNA knockdown of HIF1α
or HIF2α significantly reduced the number of migrating vimentin-positive cells. Scale bar = 100 μm.

migration, and invasive cells exhibited stronger vimentin
expression than stationary cells (Fig. 5b). Although siRNA
knockdown of HIF1/2α reduced glioma cell migration
to levels seen under normoxia, the remaining migratory
cells did not express the mesenchymal marker vimentin.
Pharmacologic HIF blockade reduced cell migration even
further, and this effect was more pronounced following
HIF2α inhibition.
Hypoxia is associated with changes in gene
expression and metabolism that collectively contribute
to its effect on cell phenotype. To determine the relative
contribution of HIF1α and HIF2α to glioma cell migration,
U87 GBM cells were transfected with hemagglutinintagged HIF α-subunit constructs with or without siRNA
to a HIF α-subunit and then placed under 1% or 21%
oxygen saturation for 24 hours (Fig. 6). Under normoxic
conditions, cells that overexpressed HIFα migrated further
than cells transfected with green fluorescent protein
(GFP) alone. There was no discernible difference between
HIF1α- and HIF2α-over-expressing cells. Migration was
reduced following HIF1α knockdown and was nearly
abolished following HIF2α knockdown. These findings
indicate that both HIF1α and HIF2α are individually
sufficient to enhance GBM cell migration and that HIF2α,
in particular, is necessary for hypoxia-induced cell
migration.
To determine whether HIF overexpression
is sufficient to induce migration in GBM stem cell
populations, we performed a migration assay on

neurospheres derived from U87 glioblastoma cells under
21% or 1% oxygen that selectively overexpressed HIF1α
or HIF2α and then determined vimentin expression by
immunofluorescence (Fig. 7). Overexpression of either
HIF α-subunit was sufficient to enhance migration away
from the neurosphere, indicating that HIFs are sufficient
to stimulate migration out of GBM stem-cell populations.

DISCUSSION
Hypoxia is a characteristic event in the progression
of GBM. Rapidly proliferating tumor cells outstrip
their blood supply leading to intratumoral necrosis and
induction of the hypoxia signaling pathways. Bevacizumab
is an anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategy that can further
exacerbate hypoxia in solid tumors. Clinical data indicate
that bevacizumab treatment can result in reduced tumor
permeability (reduced enhancement on MR imaging)
through VEGF-mediated mechanisms [23]. The reduction
in vessel permeability results in reduced peritumoral
edema and symptom improvement [24, 25]. Emerging
data indicate that bevacizumab therapy is associated
with non-enhancing (MR imaging) tumor progression
and increased risk of gliosarcoma differentiation [10].
The results of the current study demonstrate that hypoxia
activates mesenchymal transition and enhances cell
motility in GBM in a HIF-dependent manner, and this
process can be attenuated by pharmacological blockade of
HIFα. Moreover, these data suggest that while HIF1α may

preferentially enhance cell migration, HIF2α is necessary
for this event to occur.
The term “epithelial-mesenchymal transition”
was originally used to describe the process by which a
cell adopts a fibroblast-like morphology and migratory
phenotype in the process of normal embryonic
development [26, 27]. Many of these features are
recapitulated in cancer, which led to the observation that
EMT is a critical process to cancer progression [26, 27].
Mesenchymal transition (and its converse, mesenchymalepithelial transition) is now a well-described event in
epithelial tumors and is increasingly recognized as a
key event in non-epithelial cancers such as GBM [2634]. Mesenchymal transition confers multiple oncogenic
properties to cancer cells. In addition to enhancing their
invasive capacity, EMT endows differentiated cancer
cells with the capacity to become stem cells and provides
a mechanism for their continued production [26, 27,
34, 35]. EMT also plays a key role in chemoresistance:
Zeb1, for example, controls the susceptibility of GBM
to temozolomide by disinhibiting the transcription factor
c-MYB, a transcriptional activator of the DNA repair
enzyme O-6-Methylguanine DNA Methyltransferase
(MGMT) [32].
In the context of new therapeutic approaches to
GBM, mesenchymal transition is a key event in resistance
to anti-angiogenic therapy [10, 36]. Recent studies have
demonstrated that VEGF antagonists, although providing
a temporary reduction in enhancing tumor volume and
peritumoral edema, ultimately fail and can induce a
mesenchymal phenotype that is more invasive and resistant
to therapy than the original tumor [10]. Mechanisms of
resistance to VEGF antagonists are multiple. VEGF
blockade disinhibits the HGF receptor c-MET, resulting
in constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase-ras signaling
in GBM [36]. VEGF-resistant cancer cells also secrete
significantly more IL-17, resulting in the recruitment of
immature immune cells to the tumor microenvironment
[37]. VEGF inhibition directly induces tissue hypoxia
by relative vasoconstriction, disinhibition of endothelial
cell apoptosis and subsequent vessel collapse [38-40].
Intratumoral hypoxia has long been recognized as a sign
of successful antiangiogenic therapy in solid tumors but
ultimately limits its therapeutic potential by enhancing the
proliferative, invasive and stem-like properties of tumor
cells [13].
Hypoxia is a potent inducer of EMT. Hypoxiainducible factors activate transcription of multiple
EMT-related proteins that leads to a loss of cell-cell
adhesion, increased cell motility and evasion from cell
cycle arrest [41, 42]. This process is crucially dependent
on HIF stabilization, as EMT in VHL-null renal cell
carcinoma occurs in the absence of true hypoxia [41].
Under normoxic conditions, the E3 ubiquitin ligase von
Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL) ubiquitinates hydroxylated
HIF α-subunits, targeting them for degradation by the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proteasome [43]. Under hypoxic conditions or conditions
where HIF α-subunits are otherwise stabilized, the
inducible HIFα-subunits translocate to the nucleus where
they form transcriptionally active heterodimers with
constitutively expressed HIF α-subunits [44]. Activation of
the hypoxia signaling pathway is associated with increased
activation of the EMT program, increased cell motility
and adoption of stem-like traits and is thus an attractive
therapeutic target for solid tumors [27, 35, 41, 42, 45-49].
Our data demonstrate that hypoxia is a potent
enhancer of mesenchymal transition and cell motility in
GBM. These events can be significantly attenuated by
treatment with a pharmacologic inhibitor of HIFs. Given
that anti-angiogenic therapy can be associated with an
increase in intratumoral hypoxia, these findings provide
a mechanism for the observed non-enhancing progression
of tumor and the increase in frequency of secondary
gliosarcoma transformation following bevacizumab
therapy. These data offer the possibility that adjuvant
therapy with a HIF inhibitor can delay GBM progression
during anti-angiogenic therapy.

Microfluidic chip construction
The microfluidic chip consisted of a bilayer of
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and glass substrate.
All chips were designed using an SU8-2035 negative
photoresistor (Micro Chem Corp., Newton, MA)
molded from a master PDMS layer. Negative chip
molds were spun onto a glass wafer and patterned
photolithographically in duplicate (100 mm thickness
for lower layer and 190 µm thickness for upper layer),
producing unique microstructures with different heights.
PDMS base and curing agent (Sylgard Silicone elastomer
184, Dow Corning Corp., Washington, D.C.) were mixed
thoroughly 10:1 by mass, degassed under vacuum and
poured onto the master. The mold curing process was
conducted for 1 h at 80oC. After cooling, the PDMS layer
was gently peeled off of the master and trimmed to size.
Inlet and outlet holes were created by punching through
the PDMS with a razor-sharp punch. The PDMS mold
was decontaminated with oxygen plasma for 15 s, bonded
to a glass slide and sterilized with UV light for 30 m.
Rat Tail High-Concentration Type-I Collagen solution
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was compounded
according to an alternate gelation procedure, aseptically
added into collagen chamber of the chip and allowed to
gel at 37°C for 30 m.

Cells were seeded into the main channel of the
microfluidic chip at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 with
medium containing 10% FBS. The chip was then turned
on its side for 5 m to allow the cells to adhere to the
surface of the gel. Each chip was then incubated for either
24 h at 37°C, 21% O2, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator
(normoxic condition) or at 37oC in an electric microscope
stage incubation chamber (Okolab, Ottaviano, Italy)
flushed with a gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 or
0.2% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 (hypoxic conditions). Cells
were allowed to invade for 24 h, and images were recorded
every 6 h by an Olympus IX71 fluorescence microscope
equipped with a CCD digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). After 24 h, each chip was stained with primary
antibody and prepared for immunofluorescent imaging as
described above.
