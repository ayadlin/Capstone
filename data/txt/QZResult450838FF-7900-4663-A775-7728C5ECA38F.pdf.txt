BACKGROUND: Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) was detected in
blasts from approximately 50% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was correlated with an adverse
outcome. In vitro treatment of AML blasts with arsenic trioxide (ATO) down-regulated STAT3 activity within 6 hours
associated with a reduced viability within 48 hours. METHODS: A phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the biologically
effective dose and/or the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ATO in vivo in conjunction with high-dose cytarabine
(Hidac) and idarubicin (Ida) in patients with AML aged <60 years was conducted. Data were compared with 117 historic AML patients who had received treatment with Hidac/Ida. RESULTS: In total, 61 patients were enrolled onto 11
different dose levels (from 0.01 to 0.65 mg/kg ideal body weight). The MTD was 0.5 mg/kg. Compared with historic
controls, patients who received ATO/Hidac/Ida, although they had similar pretreatment characteristics, had better
overall survival (P ¼ .039). CONCLUSIONS: ATO priming may have improved the outcome of patients aged <60 years
with AML who received Hidac/Ida. The current data suggested that ATO may enhance the effect of chemotherapy.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged <60 years is characterized by complete remission rates of 70% to

80% after 1 or 2 induction treatments, and the overall cure rate is only 35% to 45%.1-3 We previously demonstrated that
the constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) protein in AML blasts is associated with short disease-free survival,4 and this STAT3 activation is down-regulated in vitro by arsenic trioxide (ATO) in
association with inhibited protein tyrosine kinase activities.5 Therefore, we investigated whether ATO could reduce constitutive STAT3 activity in vivo. Because ATO as a single agent proved to be ineffective in AML treatment,6 we

determined its effect when administered over 1 hour followed by our previously described induction regimen of
high-dose cytarabine (Hidac) (3 g/m2 [1.5 mg/m2 for
patients aged 50 years] every 12 hours for 12 doses] and
idarubicin (Ida) (12 mg/m2 for 3 doses).7
Currently, ATO is approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg. In
these patients, the beneficial action of ATO is observed
more in its promoting degradation of promyelocytic
leukemia (PML) fusion products with oncogenic activities
rather than in attenuating protein kinase activities. ATO
doses as high as 0.3 mg/kg were studied in myelodysplastic syndromes8; however, to the best of our knowledge, no
phase 1 dose escalation in combination with intensive
chemotherapy was ever conducted in AML.
ATO is methylated intracellularly to methylarsonic
acid (MMA) and dimethylarsonic acid (DMA), and a
genetic polymorphism exists in the monomethylarsonic
acid (MMA) V reductase gene, which is involved in the
biomethylation of ATO.9 Therefore, we examined
whether any single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in
this pathway was associated with the toxicities observed in
patients who were enrolled onto this trial.
To evaluate the potentially measurable, immediate
biologic effect of ATO, we studied patient samples before
and after ATO administration for the relative level of
phosphortyrosine STAT3. Treatment-related reduction
was planned to become the biologically effective dose
(BED) for a cohort of 10 patients. Alternatively, if a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) had been achieved before the
BED, then the study would have been terminated. Finally,
to verify that results from this phase 1 trial were at least as
good as the results from other phase 2 trials for newly
diagnosed AML in patients aged <60 years, we compared
patient outcomes with outcomes in a historic cohort of
117 patients with newly diagnosed AML who received
Hidac/Ida alone.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with newly diagnosed AML, excluding APL, ages
18 years and 59 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 3 were eligible.
Other eligibility criteria included the presence of 10%
blasts in peripheral blood (to allow for BED determination), adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels 2

times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 times the ULN), no prior
chemotherapy for AML except hydroxyurea, and absence
of uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses, including infections, cardiac conditions, and other organ dysfunction.
Patients with an absolute QT interval >460 msec in the
presence of serum potassium >4 millequivalents per liter
and magnesium >1.8 mg/dL were excluded. The outcome of these patients was compared with the outcome of
117 patients with newly diagnosed AML patients aged
<60 years who were enrolled onto clinical trials of Hidac/
Ida alone between September 1, 1991 and January 9,
2008. All patients signed informed consent form according to institutional guidelines and in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Design and Treatment Plan
This study used a classic 3 þ 3, phase 1 design. The starting dose of ATO was 0.01 mg/kg ideal body weight
(IBW), which was administered once intravenously over 1
hour; followed by Hidac 3 g/m2 (1.5 mg/m2 for patients
aged 50 years) administered intravenously every 12
hours for 12 doses; and Ida 12 mg/m2 for 3 doses administered intravenously after the third, fifth, and seventh
Hidac doses. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) was administered subcutaneously 12 hours after the
completion of Hidac at a dose of 5 mg/kg daily until the
patient achieved an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 5
 109/L, or the peripheral blood blast count rose 10%,
or there was a life-threatening toxicity which we believed
was related to G-CSF. The ATO dose was escalated to
0.05 mg/kg IBW, 0.1 mg/kg IBW, 0.15 mg/kg IBW, 0.2
mg/kg IBW, 0.25 mg/kg IBW, 0.3 mg/kg IBW, 0.33 mg/
kg IBW, 0.42 mg/kg IBW, 0.5 mg/kg IBW, and 0.65 mg/
kg IBW. Consolidation treatment and allogeneic transplantation were offered according to standard practice at
Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Escalation Rules
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as the occurrence of any clinically relevant and drug-related, grade
3, nonhematologic, noninfectious toxicity despite maximum supportive care or lack of hematologic recovery
within 42 days from initiation of therapy that was attributable to drug effect rather than refractory leukemia. Also,
for hepatic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, central
nervous system, and pulmonary complications, grade 3
toxicity was regarded as expected, whereas grade 4 toxicity was counted toward the DLT. Three patients were

Phase 1 ATO/Hidac/Ida in AML <60 Years/Wetzler et al

entered at each dose level. If no DLT was observed, then
patients were treated at the next higher dose level. If 1
DLT was observed, then 3 more patients were treated at
that dose level. The MTD was defined as the dose that
produced grade 3 to 4 toxicity at least in 2 of 6 patients
treated. The recommended dose for future phase 2 studies
would be the dose level immediately before the MTD.
Response and Toxicity Criteria
and Statistical Methods
Response criteria were standard.10 Complete remission
(CR) was defined as <5% blasts in a normocellular bone
marrow, an ANC 1  109/L, and a platelet count 100
 109/L. Treatment failure was defined as related to resistant disease (the patient survived for 1 week after
completing therapy, and peripheral blood smear and/or
bone marrow revealed persistent AML), complications of
aplasia (the patient who survived for 1 week after completing therapy died while cytopenic, and the last postremission bone marrow was aplastic or hypoplastic without
evidence of leukemia), or indeterminate cause (patients
died <1 week or 1 week after completing therapy, the
most recent peripheral blood smear did not reveal persistent leukemia, and bone marrow examination was not
performed subsequent to therapy). Persistent cytopenia
without leukemia was defined as persistent neutropenia
and/or thrombocytopenia despite a bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy that met criteria for CR. Relapse was defined
as the reappearance of blasts in the blood or 5% blasts in
the bone marrow that was not attributable to another
cause (eg, bone marrow regeneration) or biopsy-proven
leukemia relapse in nonmedullary site. The BED was
determined by the relative decrease in constitutive STAT3
activity after ATO treatment as indicated by Western blot
analysis (see below).
Toxicity was graded on a scale from 0 to 5 using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0. Survival
and response durations were analyzed by the KaplanMeier method.
Information on the associations between 9 SNPs and
112 NCI-CTCAE categories was tabulated. Each SNP with
sufficient variability (>5 observations in at least 2 categories) was used in logistic regression to predict DLT both
alone and adjusted for dose level. No correction for multiple
testing was done in this exploratory analysis.
The Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test
were used to compare survival distributions (time from
diagnosis to death) of patients in the current study and the

historic study. No censoring for transplantation was
conducted.
SNP Analysis
DNA was extracted from 57 cryopreserved bone marrow
or peripheral blood samples using Gentra PureGene
DNA extraction kits (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis,
Minn) and was genotyped for 9 SNPs in the MMA V reductase gene by using the iPLEX software (Sequenom
Inc., San Diego, Calif). Duplicate aliquots for approximately 10% of the samples were distributed randomly
throughout the plates for quality-control purposes. Controls for genotype and 2 ‘‘no template’’ controls also were
included on each plate. All genotyping results were
reviewed manually for quality control.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as we described previously5 with minimal modification. Briefly, peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from patients who had at least
10% blasts before and immediately after the completion
of ATO administration were isolated and immediately
extracted. Aliquots of extract containing 20 lg proteins
were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gels. The relative amount of STAT3
phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 (PY705-STAT3) compared with the total amounts of STAT3 and actin was
quantified by immunoblotting. In addition, samples were
hybridized for phosphorylated and total STAT5, total
STAT1, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein
kinase (ERK1/2). Extracts of the HEL cell line (purchased
from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) that displayed constitutive STAT3 activity served as internal
references in all analyzes. To account for background reaction of the immune reagents, the lowest level of PY705STAT3 detection was set at <2%. Band intensity >2%
was defined as constitutive activity. The BED was
expressed as the percentage reduction in phosphorylated
STAT3 band intensity as determined by densitometry
analysis4 between pre-ATO and post-ATO administration in 3 patient samples at a dose level.

DLTs and MTDs
The DLT of supraglottitis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome were achieved at 0.65 mg/kg IBW. Therefore,
the MTD was defined as 0.5 mg/kg IBW. In total, 3 additional patients were accrued at that dose level. The most
common nonhematologic, drug-related adverse events
(Table 3) were infection and skin (ranging from alopecia,
bruising, dry skin, rash, and hives). Myelosuppression was
expected with this regimen, and myelosuppression-associated complications included febrile neutropenia in 38
patients (62%). Three deaths occurred within the first 30
days of starting treatment. The cause of death in all 3
patients was multiorgan failure.

(Table 3), except that skin reactions were more common
in the ATO/Hidac/Ida cohort, and neurologic toxicities
were more common in the Hidac/Ida cohort. The consolidation treatments differed between the 2 cohorts (Table 5), with significantly more patients in the control
group receiving etoposide and cyclophosphamide as their
consolidation regimens. A similar percentage of patients
proceeded to undergo allogeneic transplantation in first
CR and beyond between the 2 cohorts (49% vs 42% for
the ATO/Hidac/Ida cohort vs the Hidac/Ida cohort,
respectively; P ¼ .3). Finally, these 2 cohorts had similar
median follow-up, but the overall survival of patients who
received ATO/Hidac/Ida was significantly longer compared with that of patients who received Hidac/Ida alone
(39.9 months vs 17.6 months; P ¼ .036) (Fig. 2). The
survival of patients in the historic control group was similar whether they were treated before or after January 1,

1, 2000; there was a trend toward better survival in the
ATO/Hidac/Ida cohort compared with the Hidac/Ida
cohort (P ¼ .07), although the difference most probably
did not reach statistical significance because of the smaller
denominator. Even after removing those patients who
received etoposide and cyclophosphamide from the analysis, the difference in survival between the 2 cohorts maintained statistical significance (P ¼ .034; data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that increasing the ATO
dose up to 0.5 mg/kg IBW in combination with intensive
chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated. The 30-day mortality rate was only 4.9%. This compares favorably with
other large studies, in which approximately 3%3 to 5%1
30-day mortality rates were reported for similar age
cohorts. Finally, although concerns regarding the longterm toxicities associated with ATO may arise, significantly higher cumulative ATO doses are used in APL
patients without known long-term consequences.12
A polymorphism in the human MMA V reductase
gene is associated with changes in urinary arsenic profiles.13 Our SNP findings, although exploratory in nature
because of the small patient population, are hypothesis
provoking. To our knowledge, the association between
allelic aberration and the occurrence of dyspnea and neutropenic fever has not been described previously. We propose that larger trials studying the use of ATO, like in
patients with APL, could look into these associations,
because several groups recently demonstrated a correlation
between genetic variation in arsenic metabolism and arsenic-related diseases.14-16

Figure 1. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) down-regulates constitutive
signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protein (PSTAT3) in samples from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The numbers represent pre-ATO and post-ATO
samples. When actin levels were not equal, immunoblotting
was repeated, as indicated on the left for samples 03-092,
03-093, 08-114, and 08-116. Samples were hybridized for
phosphorylated (PY) and total signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5, total STAT1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2, and actin.
Protein staining is shown below to further demonstrate equal
loading.

Finally, we did not observe a consistent ATO dosedependent decrease in PY705-STAT3 levels. One possible explanation for this is the relatively short exposure
followed by the administration of high-dose chemotherapy. Our in vitro work5 demonstrated an ATO effect after 6 hours of incubation. However, we believe that in
vivo exposure lasting longer than 1 hour may be inappropriate for patients aged <60 years with newly diagnosed
AML who are treated with curative intent. The other
possible explanation is that in vitro administration
reaches higher blast exposure compared with in vivo
administration. It is noteworthy that an ATO dose of 4
lM in vitro, which is sufficient to down-regulate constitutive STAT3 activity, is approximately equivalent to an
in vivo dose of 0.15 mg/kg,17 and this level is sufficient
to differentiate APL cells. However, this dose may not be

STAT3 in vivo within a 1-hour exposure period. White
blood cell analysis could not have been performed at a
later time point because of the exposure to Hidac/Ida. If
a more effective, immediate reduction in constitutive

STAT3 activity is necessary for improved outcome, then
either a longer exposure, the use of a heat-shock protein
90 inhibitor, or combining the 2 could be applied,
because we recently demonstrated that heat-shock 90
inhibitors synergize with ATO to down-regulate constitutive STAT3 activity.18,19 Therefore, testing the role of
a heat-shock protein 90 inhibitor may be a potential
future trial for AML patients. Other possibilities to
down-regulated constitutive STAT3 activity include
small-molecule peptidomimetics, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, and short interference RNA.20
It is noteworthy that our current results demonstrated improved outcome for patients who received
ATO/Hidac/Ida compared with patients who received
Hidac/Ida alone in this nonrandomized comparison.
Although this improved outcome may be explained
by earlier detection or improvements in supportive
care over the periods when these 2 sequential studies
were conducted, we propose a different explanation.
Specifically, it was demonstrated recently that ATO
targets quiescent leukemia-initiating cells.21,22 Furthermore, combining ATO with cytarabine significantly increased the efficacy of cytarabine to induce
apoptosis and eradicate the leukemia-initiating cells.21
In summary, we propose that the addition of ATO
may have improved the outcome of patients with
newly diagnosed AML aged <60 years who received
treatment with Hidac/Ida. These results merit confirmation in a randomized phase 3 trial. Additional
studies of the potential of ATO to prime leukemiainitiating cells as a means of enhancing chemotherapy
effects are warranted.
