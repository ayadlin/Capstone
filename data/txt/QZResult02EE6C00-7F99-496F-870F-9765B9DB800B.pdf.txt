Abstract
African-American (AA) women with breast cancer (BC) are diagnosed with more
aggressive disease, have higher risk of recurrence and poorer prognosis as compared
to Caucasian American (CA) women. Therefore, it is imperative to define the factors
associated with such disparities to reduce the unequal burden of cancer. Emerging
data suggest that inherent differences exist in the tumor microenvironment of AA and
CA BC patients, however, its molecular bases and functional impact have remained
poorly understood. Here, we conducted cytokine profiling in serum samples from
AA and CA BC patients and identified resistin and IL-6 to be the most differentiallyexpressed cytokines with relative greater expression in AA patients. Resistin and IL-6
exhibited positive correlation in serum levels and treatment of BC cells with resistin
led to enhanced production of IL-6. Moreover, resistin also enhanced the expression
and phosphorylation of STAT3, and treatment of BC cells with IL-6-neutralizing
antibody prior to resistin stimulation abolished STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition,
resistin promoted growth and aggressiveness of BC cells, and these effects were
mediated through STAT3 activation. Together, these findings suggest a crucial role
of resistin, IL-6 and STAT3 in BC racial disparity.

Introduction

more aggressive and metastatic disease, respond poorly
to therapy, have higher risk of recurrence and worse
prognosis as compared to CA patients [4]. Despite these
recognitions, we still do not have a clear understanding
of the biological causes and associated molecular
mechanisms involved in such disparity.
It is being increasingly appreciated that molecular
differences at the genetic level (gene mutations,
deletions, etc.) may not alone be responsible for the
observed disparity in breast and other cancers, but tumor
microenvironment (TME) may also play an important
role in the overall outcome [5]. In this regard, efforts are

Breast cancer (BC) remains the most frequently
diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer
death in women in the United States [1]. According to
the American Cancer Society, approximately 231,840
women will be diagnosed with BC and nearly 40,290 will
die with this malignancy in 2015 [1]. Epidemiological
data also suggest that women of African American
(AA) background are disproportionately affected by BC
relative to the Caucasian American (CA) women [2-4].
AA women have early onset of BC, are diagnosed with

focused on identifying the intrinsic differences in TME
and characterizing underlying biological and molecular
regulatory factors. For example, obesity and inflammation
have been associated with possible ethnic/racial
differences in BC survival and data continue to emerge
to further support this notion [3, 6]. As per a report from
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AA
population has 51 % higher obesity rates compared with
CA [7]. Obesity is associated with a low-grade chronic
inflammation, characterized by increased circulating fatty
acids and chemo-attraction of immune cells [8]. This
inflammatory microenvironment is believed to support the
growth of tumor cells, promote their aggressiveness and
alter their therapeutic responses. In the same line, a recent
study identified distinct patterns in TME (vascularization
and macrophage infiltration) of AA and CA BC patients
[9] further supporting its role in BC racial disparity.
TME contains a variety of non-tumor cells
including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes and
immune cells (resident and infiltrated) that cooperate
in tumor development and progression by producing
growth factors and cytokines [10, 11]. Resistin, originally
described as an adipocyte-derived cytokine, is mostly
expressed by the macrophages in humans [12, 13]. It
has potent pro-inflamatory properties and considered
as a potential mediator in obesity-associated diseases,
including cancer [14-16]. In a recent comprehensive
differential gene-expression analysis, resistin transcript
was identified to be expressed at greater level in AA BC as
compared to CA BC patients [17]. Similarly, IL-6 is also
an inflammation-associated pleiotropic cytokine, which
can be secreted by a wide array of immune, endothelial
as well as cancer cells in an inducible manner [18]. IL6-KO mice studies suggest that it plays an essential role
in peripheral T-cell development, T-cell activity and
lymphocyte differentiation [19]. STAT3 (signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3) is a transcription factor
activated in many malignancies, including BC [20-22].
Importantly, IL-6 is an important inducer of STAT3 that
supports the survival of cells under an inflammatory
environment [23].
In the present study, we have conducted cytokine
profiling of serum samples from patients of AA or CA
racial background and identified resistin and IL-6 to be
most differentially-expressed cytokines exhibiting greater
expression in AA patients. We also show that the treatment
of BC cells with resistin leads to enhanced expression
and phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as promotes IL-6
production. We further show that IL-6 mediates resistininduced phosphorylation of STAT3. In additional findings,
we demonstrate that resistin promotes growth and
aggressiveness of BC cells, and these effects are mediated
through STAT3 induction. These are important findings
and support a cooperative role of cytokines-transcription
factor network in BC racial disparity.

AA breast cancer patients exhibit significantly
higher serum levels of resistin and IL-6 as
compared to CA patients
Considering the emerging notion that TME
may play an important role in BC racial disparity, we
performed cytokine profiling in pooled serum samples
from five BC patients of AA or CA racial background by
ELISA. We observed that resistin and IL-6 were the most
differentially-expressed cytokines in serum of AA and CA
BC patients with significantly greater expression in AA
BC patients (Fig. 1A). To further validate these findings,
we measured resistin and IL-6 levels in individual serum
samples from AA (n=11) and CA (n=10) BC patients. The
data demonstrate that AA BC patients have significantly
higher levels of resistin (18.788 ± 1.76 ng/ml) as well
as IL-6 (4.51 ± 1.07 pg/ml) as compared to that in their
CA counterparts (7.33 ± 0.56 ng/ml and 0.88 ± 0.48 pg/
ml, respectively) (Fig. 1B and 1C). We next subjected the
expression data to Pearson correlation coefficient analysis.
Our data demonstrate that the levels of resistin and IL-6
exhibit a positive correlation in serum samples, which is
relatively higher in AA (r=0.55) as compared to that in
CA (r=0.46) BC patients (Fig. 1D and 1E). These findings
suggest a clinical association of resistin and IL-6 with BC
racial disparity.

Resistin induces IL-6 expression in breast cancer
cells
Having observed a positive correlation between
resistin and IL-6 in clinical cases, we examined if resistin
has any role in IL-6 regulation or vice versa. For this,
we first studied the expression of resistin, IL-6, and their
receptors (CAP1 and IL-6R, respectively) in a panel of
established BC cell lines of AA and CA origin. The data
show that all the breast cancer cell lines express varying
levels of IL-6, CAP1 and IL-6R (Supplementary Fig. 1),
whereas no expression of resistin is observed either at the
protein or transcript level in any of the cell lines (data not
shown). Interestingly, higher expression of CAP1, IL-6
and IL-6R were observed in AA BC cell lines comparing
to that in CA BC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1). We
next treated two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231
(CA origin) and MDA-MB-468 (AA origin) with different
doses (0-20 ng/ml) of recombinant human resistin (rhresistin). Our data demonstrate that upon resistin treatment
IL-6 was upregulated in a dose-dependent manner as
observed in immunoblot (Fig. 2A) and ELISA (Fig.
2B). We next performed a time-course study by treating
the breast cancer cells with rh-resistin for various time
intervals. The data demonstrate that slight upregulation of
11232

IL-6 occurs as early as 3 h which continues to rise till 72
h (Fig. 2C and 2D). Interestingly, a greater induction of
IL-6 was observed in MDA-MB-468 cells in response to
resistin treatment as compared to the MDA-MB-231 cells.
In a separate set of experiments, we treated BC cell lines
with varying doses (0-100 ng/ml) of recombinant human
IL-6 (rh-IL-6) to examine its effect on resistin expression.
However, we did not observe any expression of resistin
in rh-IL-6-treated BC cells either at protein or transcript
level (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest
that resistin positively regulates the expression of IL-6 in

a dose- and time-dependent manner in BC cells.

Resistin enhances STAT3 expression
phosphorylation in breast cancer cells

and

STAT3 is an oncogenic transcription factor, which
is overexpressed in breast and several other malignancies
[20, 24, 25]. Since resistin-inducible IL-6 is a known
activator of STAT3 [26], we sought out to examine the
effect of rh-resistin on STAT3. MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with various doses of

(CA) breast cancer patients. (A) Expression profile of various cytokines was analyzed by ELISA in pooled serum samples from BC
patient with CA (n=5) and AA (n=5) racial background. Levels of cytokine were plotted against the respective absorbance measured at 450
nm. (B-C) Subsequently, in a pilot study, we measured the levels of (B) resistin and (C) IL-6 in individual serum samples from CA (n=10)
and AA (n=11) patients with BC. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and amount of resistin and IL-6 was calculated using respective
standards. (D-E) Correlation between resistin and IL-6 level in (D) CA and (E) AA serum samples was calculated using Pearson correlation
analysis. Data indicate that resistin as well as IL-6 levels are high in serum of AA BC patients as compared to CA (p<0.01) and greater
correlation between resistin and IL-6 in AA BC patients.

IL-6 mediates resistin-induced phosphorylation of
STAT3

rh-resistin for a period of 48 h and its effect on STAT3
phosphorylation was examined by immunoblot analysis.
The data demonstrate that STAT3 phosphorylation
increases in a dose-dependent manner upon rh-resistin
treatment. Interestingly, we observe that along with
activation of STAT3, the expression of STAT3 is also
increased in rh-resistin-treated BC cells (Fig. 3A). Next,
we treated the BC cells with rh-resistin (20 ng/ml) for
various time intervals. Our data show an increase in
pSTAT3 and STAT3 levels after rh-resistin treatment in
a time-dependent manner. The increase in expression of
STAT3 and pSTAT3 is prominent from 6 h and continues
to rise till 48 h (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we observe that the
extent of STAT3 and pSTAT3 induction in MDA-MB-468
cells is greater than in MDA-MB-231 cells.

In next set of experiment, we sought out to examine
if resistin-induced STAT3 expression and phosphorylation
is mediated through IL-6. To test this, we treated BC
cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with human
IL-6 neutralizing antibody (rabbit polyclonal) prior to
resistin stimulation and followed changes in STAT3
phosphorylation and expression by immunoblot assay.
We also pre-treated the BC cells with rabbit IgG to serve
as control. As expected, we observed induction of both
STAT3 and pSTAT3 in rabbit IgG-pre-treated cells upon
treatment with rh-resistin. We also observed that rhresistin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was abolished
in BC cells pre-treated with IL-6 neutralizing antibody,
whereas only minor effect was seen on total STAT3
expression (Fig. 4). These data suggest that IL-6 primarily
mediates the effects of resistin on STAT3 activation. To

time intervals (C, D). Subsequently, cultured supernatants were collected and cells were lysed for protein extraction. Expression of IL-6
was examined by immunoblot assay in protein lysates (A, C) and by ELISA in culture supernatant (B, D). β-actin was used as internal

grown in 6 well plate and treated with various doses (0-20 ng/ml) of resistin at 60-70 % confluence for 48 h (A) and with a single dose of
resistin (20 ng/ml) for varying time intervals (0-48 h) (B). Total protein was extracted and expression of STAT3 and pSTAT3 was examined
by immunoblot assay using 40 µg total protein. β-actin was used as an internal control. Data indicate that resistin induces the expression of
STAT3 as well as promotes its phosphorylation in a dose- and time- dependent manner.

Figure 4: Resistin-induced phosphorylation of STAT3, but not its expression, is mediated through IL-6. Cells were
treated with resistin (20 ng/ml) in presence of control IgG or IL-6 neutralizing antibody (2 μg/ml). After 48 h of treatment, total protein was
isolated and expression of pSTAT3 and STAT3 was analyzed by immunoblot assay. β-actin was used as an internal control. Data show that
the treatment with IL-6 neutralizing antibody abolishes basal as well as resistin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in BC cells.

further confirm this, we treated the BC cells with rhIL-6 and examined its effect on STAT3 expression and
phosphorylation for various time intervals. Consistent
with previous findings [27], the data reveal a quick
activation (within 5 minutes) of STAT3 upon rh-IL-6
treatment, while negligible effect is observed on total
STAT3 expression even at late (up to 48 h) time points
(Supplementary Fig. 2).

efficacy within 48 h that sustained at least up to 96 h posttransfection (Supplementary Fig. 3). Resistin treatment
increased the growth of MDA-MB-231 (~3.3 fold) and
MDA-MB-468 (~4.2 fold) cells, whereas STAT3 silencing
caused significant decrease in basal as well as rh-resistin
induced growth in both the cell lines (Fig. 5A). In parallel,
to monitor the effect of rh-resistin on BC cell growth
in long term, we performed plating efficiency assay.
Significantly enhanced plating efficiency was observed in
rh-resistin treated MDA-MB-231 (~2.0 fold) and MDAMB-468 (~2.3 folds) cells as compared to untreated cells
(Fig. 5B). Furthermore, STAT3 silencing decreased the
plating efficiency of BC cells, an effect, which remained
unaltered following rh-resistin treatment (Fig. 5B).
Next, we investigated the role of resistin in
promoting the malignant behavior of BC cells. For this, we
studied the effect of resistin on motility and invasiveness,
which are two important characteristics of the aggressive
cancer cells [28]. Significant increase in the number of
migrated cells was observed in the rh-resistin-treated
MDA-MB-231 (~2.0 fold) and MDA-MB-468 (~3.0 fold)
cells as compared to their respective controls (Fig. 6A). To
elucidate the effect of rh-resistin on the invasive properties
of BC cells, we performed in vitro Matrigel invasion assay.

Resistin promotes growth and aggressive
phenotype of breast cancer cells through STAT3
activation
Having observed an overexpression of resistin in
BC patients and its association with STAT3 upregulation,
we next examined its effect on the growth and malignant
phenotype of BC cells and whether these effects are
mediated through STAT3. For this, we first transiently
transfected BC cells with STAT3-specific (siSTAT3)- or
non-targeted scrambled (NT-Scr) siRNAs for 24 h (in
case of growth and clonogenicity assay) and 48 h (in
case of motility and invasion assays) prior to rh-resistin
treatment. STAT3 siRNAs exhibited efficient silencing

level of resistin in blood circulation [38]. Thus, the finding
of higher resistin levels in BC patients can be explained
by the activation of macrophages as a part of the inducing
inflammatory process.
Uncontrolled proliferation and aggressiveness are
some of the most important characteristics of the cancer
cells. Clinically, AA BC patients tend to be diagnosed
with more advanced disease and as a result with poorer
prognosis as compared to CA BC patients [2, 5]. Our
findings demonstrate that stimulation of BC cells with
resistin not only enhanced their growth, but also resulted
in increased motility and invasive potential of BC cells.
These findings are significant and support the notion
that elevated expression of resistin in AA BC patients as
compared to that in their CA counterpart may underlie
the greater aggressiveness of the disease in these patients.
Other published studies have also reported a role of resistin
in cancer progression, invasion and metastasis [39-43].
Resistin was shown to promote proliferation in prostate
cancer [39] and associated with migratory potential and
metastasis of chondrosarcoma [42]. Moreover, in a recent
study, it was shown that mice receiving anti-resistin
antibody had significantly decreased incidence of lung
cancer development and metastasis [40]. Furthermore,
its role in promoting cell adhesion to the vascular
endothelium has also been demonstrated in hepatocellular
carcinoma [43]. In some studies, a significance of resistin
in the neovascularization process has also been reported.
Resistin was shown to stimulate capillary formation [41],
and proliferation and migration of endothelial cells [44].
In some earlier studies, an overexpression of resistin
receptor, CAP1, has been reported in BC and associated
with its pathobiological development [45, 46]. Since we
also observed more advanced expression of CAP1 in AA
BC cells, it is likely that CAP1 serves as an additional
determinant of BC racial disparity. Furthermore, enhanced
expression of CAP1 can also explain more potent effect of
resistin treatment on IL-6 and STAT3 expression as well as
growth and aggressiveness of AA BC cells.
Another significant finding of our study is that we
identified oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 to be a
crucial mediator of resistin-induced effects on BC cells.
STAT3 is a transcription factor, which is constitutively
activated in many malignancies, including BC [21].
Role of STAT3 in induction and maintenance of an
inflammatory microenvironment during initiation and
progression of cancer is well documented [47-49]. It is
an influential mediator of tumorigenesis, and has been
shown to be crucial for tumor growth, cell proliferation,
and apoptosis [50-52]. Moreover, BC cells expressing
activated STAT3 exhibit poorer therapeutic response to
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy [50]. It is suggested that IL-6
plays an important role in STAT3 activation [23]. In that
regard, our finding identifying resistin as a regulator of
IL-6 is highly significant. Moreover, we have revealed that
resistin, while inducing STAT3 phosphorylation in an IL-6

Our data demonstrate increased invasiveness of the MDAMB-231 (~2.3-fold), and MDA-MB-468 (~2.4 fold) BC
cells treated with rh-resistin as compared with control cells
(Fig. 6B). Notably, STAT3 silencing remarkably decreased
the basal as well as rh-resistin-induced migration and
invasion potential of BC cells (Fig. 6A and 6B). Taken
together, these findings clearly highlight the role of STAT3
in resistin-induced growth and aggressive phenotypes of
BC cells.

Discussion
Although molecular differences at the genetic level
(gene mutations, deletions, etc.) may exist, it is being
increasingly appreciated that TME plays an important
role in prevalent racial disparity in breast cancer clinical
outcome [9]. Data presented herein provide further
support to this notion and establish resistin and IL-6 to be
important TME-associated factors that could be the key
determinant of BC racial disparity. Moreover, the data also
delineate molecular association of resistin and IL-6 at the
regulatory level and establish STAT3 as a vital mediator
in conferring the phenotypic response of resistin in breast
tumor cells.
Association of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and
IL-6 with breast cancer risk has been reported previously
[29-32]. Resistin is shown to positively correlate with
increased tumor stage, size and lymph node metastasis
in BC [33]. Moreover, an inverse correlation of resistin
expression with disease-free as well as overall survival
rates has also been reported in BC patients [33]. Similarly,
the role of IL-6 has been well studied in several cancer
types [27, 30, 34]. IL-6 is secreted by a wide array of
immune, endothelial as well as cancer cells in an inducible
manner. IL-6-KO mice studies suggested that it played an
essential role in the development of immune cells [19].
Significant racially disparate overexpression of IL-6 in
BC patients and its association with resistin add another
dimension to its pathobiological involvement in breast
carcinogenesis. While both resistin and IL-6 exhibited
elevated serum levels in AA BC serum as compared to
CA patients, we did not detect resistin expression in any
of the tested BC cell lines. This might be an effect of longterm culturing of these cells or suggest that the stromal
cells are the major source of elevated serum levels of
resistin in BC patients. In fact, studies have reported that
in human, resistin is generally produced by the recruited
immune cells or resident macrophages [12, 13], and its
role in differentiation of monocyte to macrophage has also
been suggested [13, 35]. Treatment of macrophages with
resistin induced the production of the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-12 and TNF-α [36]. Moreover, it was
also shown that the activation of macrophages with
proinflammatory cytokines or endotoxin significantly
enhanced the production of resistin [37]. In addition,
delivery of endotoxin to human subjects also increased the

dependent manner; regulates the expression of STAT3 via
some yet unknown mechanism.
In conclusion, we have shown a differential
expression of resistin and IL-6 in AA and CA BC patients.
Furthermore, our data have revealed a novel mechanistic
association of resistin and IL-6 and identified resistin as a
novel regulator of STAT3 expression and phosphorylation,
where resistin-induced IL-6 expression likely mediates
STAT3 activation. In additional novel findings, we have
demonstrated STAT3 to be an important mediator of
resistin-induced growth and aggressiveness of BC cells.
In view of these findings, it appears that resistin and IL-6
may serve as novel, mechanistically-linked set of serum
biomarkers exhibiting greater incidence as well as overall
levels in AA BC patients compared to that in their CA
counterparts. These data also suggest that novel, resistinand IL-6- targeted therapeutic strategies can be developed
to treat aggressive and metastatic breast tumors, and thus
reduce the prevalent racial disparity in clinical outcome.

BC cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) grown
in 96- or 6-well plates were treated with resistin (Phoenix
Pharma, Burlingame, CA) or IL-6 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) as indicated in pertinent figure legends. For
transient silencing of STAT3,  60-70 % confluent  BC
cells were transfected with non-targeting- or STAT3specific siRNAs (30 nM) using X-treme GENE HP DNA
Transfection Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. To elucidate the role of IL-6
in resistin-induced STAT3 expression/phosphorylation,
BC cells were treated with IL-6 neutralizing antibody (2
µg/ml) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or control IgG (2 µg/ml)
(Santa Cruz) antibody for 48 h prior to resistin stimulation.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Cytokines profile of pooled serum samples from
AA or CA BC patients were analyzed by human cytokine
ELISA kit (Signosis, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) as per
manufacturer’s instruction. Level of resistin and IL-6 in
human serum specimens or cultured supernatant of BC
cells were analyzed using human resistin and human IL-6
ELISA kits (R&D Systems, MN, USA), respectively, as
per manufacturer’s instructions.

Materials and methods
Cell lines and human serum specimens
The human BC cell lines, MCF7, BT-549, MDAMB-453, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HCC70,
were procured from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All the
cell lines were maintained in their required Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences, Logan, Utah), or Minimum Essential Medium
(MEM) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) supplemented
with 5 % or 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta
Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), penicillin (100 units/
ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C. All
the cell lines were tested periodically for mycoplasma and
determined to be free from infection. Serum specimens
from breast cancer patients of AA and CA racial
backgrounds were obtained through Institutional Biobank
under the Institutional Review Board-approved protocol.

Immunoblot analysis
Protein from BC cells was isolated using NP-40
lysis buffer containing protease phosphatase inhibitor.
Thereafter, protein samples (20-80 µg) were resolved
by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis
as described earlier [53, 54] using proteins specific
antibodies. The primary antibodies were used at 1:1000
dilution with the respective HRP labeled secondary
antibodies at 1:2500 dilution. β-actin was used at 1:20000
dilution. The signal was detected with ECL plus Western
Blotting substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT)
using LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.,
Tokyo, Japan).

To analyze the effects of the resistin on the
migration and invasion ability of STAT3 silenced BC cells,
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected
with NT-Scr or STAT3-targeting siRNAs for 48 h. Post
transfection, cells were treated with resistin (20 ng/ml)
for next 48 h and seeded (2.5x105/well for migration
and 5x104/well for invasion) on top of non-coated (for
migration) or Matrigel-coated (for invasion) transwell
chamber by following the previously described procedure
[28, 56].

Statistical analysis
All the experiments were performed at least three
times, and data are expressed as mean ± SD. Wherever
suitable, the data were also subjected to unpaired two
tailed Student’s t-test and p< 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
