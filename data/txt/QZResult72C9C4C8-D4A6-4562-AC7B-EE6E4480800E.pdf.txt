BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first relapse is associated with a poor outcome even when treated
with intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine (IHDAraC). Gemtuzumab ozogamycin (GO) used as a single agent has
clinical activity in relapsed and refractory AML. Various combination regimens of GO have been developed, but few
data are available regarding their efficacy compared with IHDAraC-based regimens. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of response and survival in 90 AML patients in first relapse treated with either
IHDAraC (n ¼ 56) or IHDAraC þ GO (n ¼ 34). Patient characteristics of the two groups were comparable. RESULTS:
Median follow-up was 37 months. Compared with IHDAraC, IHDAraC þ GO induction was associated with a better
response rate (68% vs 45%, P ¼ .04), a better overall survival (median, 35 months vs 6 months, P ¼ .001), and a better
event-free survival (24 months vs 6 months, P ¼ .002). This effect was limited to patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In multivariate analysis, age, cytogenetic risk, first complete remission duration, and the use of
IHDAraC þ GO were independently associated with better results. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the addition of GO to IHDAraC is associated with a better efficacy for patients in first relapse of AML with low- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Prospective controlled studies of GO in this population are warranted. Patients with high-risk

Nonpromyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a poor outcome, with >50% of patients
experiencing relapse regardless of frontline induction chemotherapy. When relapse occurs, the prognosis is even poorer,
with <50% of second remission after intensive salvage chemotherapy and a median overall survival (OS) of <12 months.1
Prognosis factors such as cytogenetics, age, and duration of the first complete remission (CR1) allow the discrimination of
patients with different outcomes.2 The conventional treatment of relapse relies on high-dose cytarabine,3-6 but this gives
poor results and may be too toxic for elderly patients. Relapsing AML is clearly identified as a situation where medical
needs are unmet, and many investigational agents have been evaluated in this setting over the past years.4

Benefit of Gemtuzumab for First Relapsed AML/Prebet et al

Among these treatments, gemtuzumab ozogamycin
(GO) is the only one approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for the first salvage of elderly AML.
This targeted therapy is a monoclonal antibody directed
against CD33 expressed by AML blasts and is conjugated
with calicheamycin, a potent pro-apoptotic agent. When
the antibody binds CD33 at the surface of leukemic cells,
it is internalized, and calicheamycin is activated by intracytoplasmic hydrolysis. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of GO as a single agent in relapsed and refractory
AML.7,8 Other studies conducted in patients in the same
situation have reported promising results of GO given in
combination with other agents such as cytarabine,9-11
supporting the rationale for the evaluation of such regimens in previously untreated AML patients. However,
few studies have directly compared the use of a GO-based
regimen with conventional salvage chemotherapy for
relapsed AML patients.
To this respect, we performed a retrospective study
of AML patients in first relapse treated in our center by intensive chemotherapy with and without GO. We compared the response rate and the survival of the patients
treated with these 2 regimens. We demonstrated that the
addition of GO to intensive salvage chemotherapy results
in a significantly better response rate, overall survival, and
relapse-free survival. We also show that this effect is restricted to patients with low-risk (LR) and intermediaterisk (IR) cytogenetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
All patients were treated over the last 10 years in the Institut Paoli-Calmettes. Follow-up was updated in January
2010. All patients gave their consent for use of clinical
and biological data. The current study was approved by
the internal review board of Institut Paoli-Calmettes.
Patients from our database were selected according to the
following criteria: 1) diagnosis of AML according to
World Health Organization criteria,12 2) patients in first
relapse after at least one induction regimen with a minimum CR1 duration of 3 months, 3) patients treated for
relapse with intensive salvage chemotherapy including intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine (IHDAraC) defined
by more than 500 mg/m2/d for at least 2 days. Patients
were excluded from the analysis if 1) there was a diagnosis
of acute promyelocytic leukemia, 2) patient was refractory
to frontline treatment. All patients had a complete biological panel at diagnosis including immunophenotyping,

cytogenetics, and FLT3 mutations typing for the more
recent patients. The cytogenetic risk groups were defined
using the conventional 3-group system.13
A total of 90 patients were included in the analysis.
The median follow-up was 37 months (range, 11-166
months for the patients alive at last follow-up). The
detailed characteristics of the patients are depicted in
Table 1. There were no significant differences between
the pretreatment characteristics of the 2 groups: the median age was 50 years (range, 24-71 years) including 13
patients (14%) >65 years. The median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) at
relapse was 1 (range, 0-4, 18% of patients with PS of 2
and higher). Frontline induction regimen was a standard
3 þ 7 regimen (daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1-3 and
cytarabine 200 mg/m2 days 1-7 (100 mg/m2 for patients
>65 years). Patients <65 years with persistent disease at
day 15 were further treated using cytarabine 1000 mg/m2
days 15-18 and daunorubicine 35 mg/m2 days 15-16.
Consolidation chemotherapy included intermediate- to
high-dose cytarabine cycles. In patients >65 years, maintenance therapy of low-dose cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate was used. The median CR1
duration was 8 months (range, 3-69 months) with 30
patients (33%) relapsing within 6 months after CR, 28
(32%) patients relapsing from 6 to 12 months, and 32
patients (35%) relapsing after 12 months. Cytogenetics
risk groups were balanced between the 2 treatment groups
with overall 13 patients (22%) in the low-risk group, 57
patients (43%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 20
patients (22%) in the high-risk (HR) group. Presence of
FLT3-ITD mutations were assessed in 26 of the 46
patients (56%) with normal cytogenetics (see details in
Table 1).
Treatment
GO is not approved in Europe and was given as part of
the French Patient Named Program, which required
CD33 expression on AML blasts at the time of relapse
(defined by at least 20% of the blast cells at relapse
expressing CD33 with a mean fluorescent intensity ratio
[CD33 antibody/isotypic control] >5-fold).
All patients received IHDAraC during the induction
treatment of their first relapse. The choice of the salvage
regimen was driven by age, CD33 expression, and the cumulative dose of anthracycline. A total of 56 patients
(62%) received IHDAraC without GO, and 34 patients
(38%) were treated with IHDAraC þ GO. Additional
drugs were given to 30 patients (52%) in the IHDAraC

group and 27 patients (79%) in the IHDAraC þ GO
group, respectively (P ¼ NS). These drugs were anthracyclines, etoposide or topotecan, with MEC14 and
MIDAM15 protocols used in the majority of patients (see
Table 2 for the details of the salvage chemotherapy regimens). The average dose of GO was 6 mg/m2/d (range,
3-9 mg/m2/d). Continuous intravenous heparin was used
as a prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) for 88%
of the patients (n ¼ 30) treated in the IHDAraC þ GO
group.
Patients in CR2 after salvage were scheduled to
receive several courses of consolidation therapy without
GO. All patients aged <65 years were considered for an
allogeneic hemotopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
using matched related or unrelated donors.

Response Criteria
The overall response rate included CR and CR1 defined
according to standard criteria.16 Induction death, including early death and hypoplastic death, were evaluated as
previously described.17

Statistical Analyses
Data were summarized by frequency and percentage for
categorical variables. For continuous variables, the median
and range were computed. All results are presented with
their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical tests were
2-sided at the 5% level of significance. To investigate the
association between continuous variables and categorical
variables, univariate statistical analyses were performed
using nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test or KruskalWallis rank sum test when appropriate. Survival rates
were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival was defined by the time interval from the date of the
salvage chemotherapy until death from any cause with observation ending at the date of last contact for patients last
known to be alive. The event-free survival was defined by
the time interval from the date of the salvage chemotherapy until relapse or death from any cause. The disease-free
survival was defined as the time from the date of second
remission to relapse or death from any cause. Patients
without event were censored at the date of the last followup. Multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox
method or logistic regression method when appropriate.

patient in the IHDAraC group and 2 patients in the
IHDAraC þ GO group showed partial response, as
defined by the international criteria, but were not classified as responders. Interestingly, the difference of overall
response rate was not significant between the IHDAraC

and included IHDAraC for 33 patients (69%). There
were no significant differences between the two treatment
groups regarding consolidation chemotherapy. Allogeneic

Overall Survival
With a median follow-up of 37 months, 24 patients were

causes of death in CR were infection (n ¼ 2) and hemorrhage (n ¼ 1).
The median overall survival was 8 months for the
whole population. There was a significant difference (P ¼
.001) between the IHDAraC þ GO and IHDAraC
groups (35 months and 6 months, respectively) (Fig. 2A).
This effect was also observed when censoring at the time
of transplant was applied (data not shown). The univariate analysis of the variables influencing OS also showed

20 months, respectively, P ¼ .04). The multivariate analysis (Table 4) showed that all of these variables remained
significantly associated with overall survival.
Interestingly, the impact of the treatment group was
different among the cytogenetic risk groups (Fig. 2B): In
patients with low risk or intermediate risk, there was a significant benefit of treatment with IHDAraC þ GO vs
IHDAraC alone (median OS, not reached vs 8 months,

continuous response. This included 9 of the 17 patients in
CR1 (53%) and 16 of the 31 patients in CR (52%, P ¼
NS). Among the 20 patients allotransplanted in second
response, 6 relapsed and 14 remained in response. All the
patients who relapsed after allogeneic transplantation
died. Relapse incidence was significantly lower in the
IHDAraC þ GO group compared with the IHDAraC
group (7 of 23 [30%] vs 16 of 25 [64%], respectively, P ¼
.02).
Median event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free
survival (DFS) were 7 months and 22 months, respectively, for the whole population. The 2-year probability of
EFS and DFS were, respectively, 47% vs 16% (P ¼ .002)
and 61% vs 31% (P ¼ .004) in the IHDAraC þ GO
group vs the IHDAraC alone group (Fig. 3). The univariate analysis also showed that age (<65 years vs >65 years;
8 months vs 3 months, respectively, P ¼ .02), cytogenetics

(LR vs IR vs HR; 24 months vs 8 months vs 4 months,
respectively, P ¼ .005), and CR1 duration (<12 months
vs others; 5 months vs 12 months, respectively, P ¼ .03)
had a significant impact on EFS, whereas age (<65 years
vs 65 years; 36 months vs 7 months, respectively, P ¼
.03) was the only other variable significantly associated
with relapse-free survival (RFS). Of note, there was no significant impact of the type of initial response (ie, CR vs
CRi) on EFS and DFS (data not shown). There was no
significant difference of EFS or RFS between the
IHDAraC þ GO and IHDAraC groups for patients with
high-risk cytogenetics.
In the multivariate analyses, age and treatment
group had a significant impact on both EFS and DFS,
whereas cytogenetics risk stratification and CR1 duration
had a significant impact associated with EFS but no significant impact on RFS (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Our report shows that the use of IHDAraC þ GO-based
regimen for AML patients in first relapse compared with
IHDAraC alone is associated with a better response rate,
which translates into a better overall survival and diseasefree survival and that this benefit is limited to patients
with low-risk and intermediate-risk cytogenetics.
These results were obtained from the comparison
with historical controls, which of course limits the significance of the conclusions. However, the 2 groups were balanced with regard to the variables shown to have a
prognostic impact on the outcome of first-relapse AML
populations including age, cytogenetics, FLT3 mutations,
and CR1 duration.
Few comparative studies evaluating the impact of
GO for the first salvage of AML have been performed.18,19 One randomized phase 2 prospective study
from the ECOG18 comparing 3 salvage regimens including 1 intermediate-dose cytarabine þ GO regimen was
recently published and did not find any benefit from GO
addition. In this study, response rates were extremely low
(12% in the IHDAraC þ GO vs 7% and 4% in the 2
other IHDAraC-based regimens). This is lower than
reported in our series and in others including first salvage
patients.19-21 Patients’ selection seems to be the main reason for this as refractory patients, patients in second
relapse or beyond, and a high proportion of patients with
HR cytogenetics were included. It is worth noting that
our results showed that GO-IHDAC failed to improve
the outcome of patients with HR cytogenetics. In our

980

cohort, 91% (n ¼ 31) of the patients in the IHAraC þ
GO group received the high-dose cytarabine regimen
instead of intermediate-dose cytarabine (total cytarabine
dose <10g/m2), which may potentially increase the additive effects of GO. However, there are no conclusive data
supporting a real difference of outcome between intermediate- and high-dose AraC alone.22,23
Recently, disappointing results from frontline comparative studies testing the addition of GO to induction/
consolidation chemotherapy in previously untreated
patients have been reported.22,24,25 How can we explain
the differences with our results? Interaction of GO with
the other drugs used in these regimens is one possible explanation. Indeed, high-dose cytarabine is known to
potentialize with GO.26 This was suggested also by the
MRC15 trial results, which showed a benefit of GO in
patients treated with FLAG-Ida.22 Moreover, a recent
publication26 reported in vitro synergy between mitoxantrone and GO, which was used in combination with GO
in 64% of the patients in our study.
As a consequence of increased CR rate in the
IHDAraC þ GO group, more patients were transplanted
in our series, and transplanted patients had a better survival than nontransplanted patients (data not shown).
Interestingly, we found no excessive toxicity as reflected
by the low transplant-related mortality observed, which is
in line with a recent report of patients transplanted after a
GO-containing salvage.27 Conversely, the effect of GO
on survival was not restricted to transplanted patients as
shown by the survival analysis performed using censoring
at the time of transplant (data not shown).
Altogether, these data suggest that the addition of
GO to IHDAC-containing salvage regimens might
improve the outcome of AML patients in first relapse.
Prospective controlled studies are therefore needed to confirm these results. Our study indicates that such trials
should evaluate the addition of GO to IHDAraC and/or
mitoxantrone-containing regimens in patients with
relapsed AML, excluding patients with HR cytogenetics.
