ABSTRACT
First line treatment for pancreatic cancer consists of surgical resection, if
possible, and a subsequent course of chemotherapy using the nucleoside analogue
gemcitabine. In some patients, an active transport mechanism allows gemcitabine to
enter efficiently into the tumor cells, resulting in a significant clinical benefit. However,
in most patients, low expression of gemcitabine transporters limits the efficacy of
the drug to marginal levels, and patients need frequent administration of the drug
at high doses, significantly increasing systemic drug toxicity. In this article we focus
on a novel targeted delivery approach for gemcitabine consisting of conjugating the
drug with an EphA2 targeting agent. We show that the EphA2 receptor is highly
expressed in pancreatic cancers, and accordingly, the drug-conjugate is more effective
than gemcitabine alone in targeting pancreatic tumors. Our preliminary observations
suggest that this approach may provide a general benefit to pancreatic cancer patients
and offers a comprehensive strategy for enhancing delivery of diverse therapeutic
agents to a wide range of cancers overexpressing EphA2, thereby potentially reducing
toxicity while enhancing therapeutic efficacy.

INTRODUCTION

of patients showed clinical benefit with Gemcitabine,
as compared to only 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients. The
median survival was 5.65 months for Gemcitabine and
4.41 months for 5-FU. Finally, 18% of patients treated
with Gemcitabine were alive at a 12-month time point,
while survival at this time point for patients treated with
5-FU was only 2% [3]. This trial encouraged the FDA to
approve Gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
in 1998. Gemcitabine is currently a standard treatment
used for patients with pancreatic cancer, although the drug
only provides minimal benefit to patients. Gemcitabine
triphosphate acts as an analog for deoxycytidine
triphosphate, which allows it to be incorporated into DNA
during replication. After Gemcitabine is incorporated,
another nucleotide may be added to the chain, but inhibition

Pancreatic cancer is an extremely aggressive and
deadly disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than
5%. Most tumors are either locally advanced or have
metastasized at the time of diagnosis and, intrinsically, this
cancer is extremely resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.
Currently, first line treatment for pancreatic cancer consists
of surgical resection, if possible, and a subsequent course of
chemotherapy [1]. This chemotherapy usually consists of
treatment with Gemcitabine [2].
In 1997, Burris, et al. published a clinical study
comparing Gemcitabine to 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) for the
treatment of pancreatic cancer [3]. In this study, 126
patients were enrolled with 63 per treatment group. 23.8%

of chain elongation subsequently occurs. DNA damage
repair is not able to remove the drug and, consequently,
apoptosis occurs [4].
Gemcitabine enters the cell through multiple cell
membrane transporters, although the sodium-independent
transporter, hENT1, has been shown to preferentially
transport Gemcitabine [4]. Though there are multiple
mechanisms of Gemcitabine resistance, one important
mechanism revolves around expression of this protein.
Giovannetti et al. showed that patients with tumors that
express high amounts of hENT1 have a greater survival
advantage with Gemcitabine treatment as compared to those
with lower hENT1 expression [5]. Patients with higher
hENT1 expression have tumors that can more readily take
up Gemcitabine, leading to an increased clinical benefit.
However, in many tumors, low expression of Gemcitabine
transporters translates into a need for the drug to be
administered frequently and at high doses, significantly
increasing systemic drug toxicity.
Because systemic toxicity and drug delivery are
major issues with most chemotherapeutic agents, the
creation of targeted therapies that lower the risk of toxicity
has become an attractive strategy in developing novel
cancer therapeutics. Targeted therapies focus on attacking
cancer cells specifically while sparing normal cells to
reduce side effects. One specific strategy of targeted therapy
involves modifying currently used drugs to make them
cancer specific. This often involves identifying a biomarker
on cancer cells that the modified drug can target. One such
target is the EphA2 receptor.
Eph receptors are a family of tyrosine kinase
receptors involved in neuronal connectivity, blood vessel
development, and cell-cell interactions [6−27]. The receptor
sub-type EphA2 was identified in cancer cells where it is
often highly expressed, mediating communication not only
between individual cancer cells, but also between cancer
cells and surrounding stromal or vascular cells [6−27].
Despite EphA2 overexpression, expression of ephrinA1,
its ligand, often remains normal even in a cancerous state.
This can lead to the accumulation of un-activated EphA2
and subsequent oncogenic activity [6].
Peptides have been developed that, similar to the
natural ligand for this receptor, selectively bind EphA2
and cause receptor activation and internalization. Hence,
in principle, these peptides can be chemically linked to
commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs and act as specific
delivery agents for these drugs to tumor cells. Once the
receptor is activated, the peptide and its attached drug are
internalized via a lysosomal pathway, where the peptide is
degraded and the drug is released and free to exert its toxic
effects on the cell [28]. Our previous studies have shown
that Paclitaxel conjugated with these peptides showed
increased efficacy in prostate and renal cancers [28−31].
EphA2-targeting molecules reported thus far include two
12-mer peptides, named YSA (of amino acid sequence
YSAYPDSVPMMS) and SWL (of amino acid sequence
SWLAYPGAVSYR), that have been identified via phage
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

display techniques [32]. Subsequently, we reported on the
agent YNH (of amino acid sequence YSAYPDSVP(Nle)
(Hsr)S, where Nle and Hsr represent L-norleucine and
L-homo-serine, respectively) [28, 31] and very recently
we designed a related EphA2 agonist, named 123B9, that
presented increased plasma and in vivo stability over YSA
and YNH [33]. These agents were designed to specifically
bind to the EphA2 receptor ligand binding domain (LBD).
We demonstrated that drug conjugates via such agents
induce receptor activation and internalization of the drug
selectively to EphA2 expressing cancer cells and tumor
vasculature [28−31]. In particular, we demonstrated that a
targeted delivery strategy of Paclitaxel using these EphA2
targeting agents is more efficacious than Paclitaxel alone
in xenograft models of pancreatic cancer [30].
Gemcitabine, as mentioned above, although the
current first-line treatment for pancreatic cancer, does not
offer great therapeutic benefit to most patients. Hence, the
goal of this study was to design and characterize a novel
targeted delivery strategy for Gemcitabine by conjugating
it with our EphA2 targeting agents. Our experiments
clearly suggest that conjugation of Gemcitabine with our
EphA2 targeting agents increase its efficacy in animal
models. Further studies on the use of EphA2 targeting
agents such as YNH or 123B9 to direct chemotherapy
to pancreatic cancers is therefore warranted to devise
innovative and perhaps more effective therapies for this
invariably fatal and aggressive cancer.

RESULTS
Design and synthesis of EphA2-targeting agents
conjugated with gemcitabine
The synthesis of YNH-L2-Gem (YDH-L2-Gem)
and 123B9-L2-Gem followed the general scheme shown
in Figure 1. The final drug conjugates were obtained by
coupling the corresponding YNH, YDH or 123B9 motifs
(Supplementary Figure S1) to the synthesized azidohexanoyl
gemcitabine (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S4). Briefly, a
stirred solution of azidohexanoyl-gemcitabine (0.097 mmol)
containing the corresponding EphA2 targeting motif
(0.105 mmol) in DMSO-water (4:1, 3.0 mL) was added
to CuSO4 (1.0 M, 50 µL) and sodium ascorbate (1.0 M,
50 µL) and continually stirred for another 2 days. The
product was purified on a reverse phase C-18 column by
HPLC with a gradient of 10–90% acetonitrile-water to give
the title compounds as white powder.
To further verify the binding affinity and selectivity
of the resulting conjugates for the EphA2 ligand binding
domain (LBD), we expressed and purified EphA2 and
EphA4 ligand binding domains (EphA2-LBD and
EphA4-LBD). These proteins were dissolved to a final
concentration of 100 µM in 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH = 6.5), containing 100 mM NaCl. Isothermal Titration
Calorimetry (ITC) measurements under these experimental
conditions revealed that YNH-L2-Gem and 123B9-L217104

Gem bound to EphA2 with Kd values of 3.8 µM and
2.3 µM, respectively (Figure 1; Supplementary Figure S1).
In contrast, no appreciable binding was observed for the
scrambled YDH-motif to the EphA2-LBD or for any of

the agents for the EphA3-LBD (Figure 1; Supplementary
Figure S1). These data are consistent with our previous
studies with unconjugated peptides and related Paclitaxel
conjugates [28−31].

intermediates and final compounds are reported as Supplementary Figure S4. Isothermal titration calorimetry data for YNH-L2-GEM
against (B) EphA2 and (C) EphA3 LBD ligand binding domains are reported. For the binding between EphA2 LBD and YNH-L2-GEM the
data revealed a Kd = 3.8 µM, ∆H = −16 Kcal/mol, −T∆S = −9.1 Kcal/mol. No appreciable binding was detected between YNH-L2-GEM
and the EphA3 LBD (~50% sequence identity with the EphA2 LBD). Similar data were obtained with 123B9-L2-GEM (Supplementary
Figure S1).

Pancreatic cancer cell lines and human
pancreatic cancer tissue contain elevated EphA2

EphA2-targeting-gemcitabine conjugates are
more effective than gemcitabine as single agents
in xenografts of pancreatic cancer

Analysis of EphA2 expression in a variety of
pancreatic cancer cell lines, including MIA PaCa-2, PANC1, BxPC-3, and AsPC-1 cells (ATCC) and normal immortal
LT2 cells (Millipore) was performed using western blotting
experiments probed with a primary antibody for the
EphA2 receptor (Cell Signaling, used at 1:1,000 dilution).
Representative data obtained with 5 × 105 cells are reported
in Figure 2A. Overexpression of the EphA2 receptor
appeared evident in all cell lines tested. Among these, the
MIA-PaCa-2 cell line was chosen for subsequent xenograft
studies.
Normal human pancreatic tissue, chronic pancreatitis
tissue, and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissue
[34, 35] were also probed for EphA2 expression using a
rabbit anti-EphA2 (ab78002, abcam, 1/200). We observed
that the EphA2 antibody did not appear to stain normal
tissue (Figure 2B) except perhaps for some slight staining
around the center of some acini. In chronic pancreatitis
tissue, we found EphA2 staining in surviving acinar tissue,
and also in some unknown tissue with characteristic islets
morphology (Figure 2C). Staining of the EphA2 antibody
in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue was evident
in cancerous, but not in normal ducts and also in some
fibroblast cells within stroma (Figure 2D).

MIA PaCa-2-luc cells were used to create bilateral
subcutaneous xenografts in athymic nude mice. Western
blotting data showed that this pancreatic cancer cell line
highly expresses EphA2 (Figure 2A). Cells were injected
into each flank and then allowed to grow for approximately
1 week. At this point, mice were imaged using BLI and
treatment was subsequently initiated. Mice were divided
into 4 groups (PBS, Gemcitabine, YDH-L2-Gemcitabine,
YNH-L2-Gemcitabine) with 9 mice/group. YDH-L2Gemcitabine is a scrambled control, where the peptide
attached to Gemcitabine should not be specific for EphA2
and, therefore, should not bind to the receptor. Animals
were treated 2 times per week via tail vein injection for
4 weeks. A dose of 10 mg/kg Gemcitabine was used along
with equimolar doses of YDH-L2-Gemcitabine and YNHL2-Gemcitabine. At the end of 4 weeks, animals were again
imaged and treatment was ended.
As expected, YDH-L2-Gemcitabine did not have
significant effects on tumor growth. Gemcitabine had
a modest effect on tumor growth, though YNH-L2Gemcitabine showed the greatest inhibition of tumor growth
of all groups evaluated (Figure 3A). This can be observed
both through tumor measurement and by BLI (Figure 3B).

tissue of chronic pancreatitis tissue (panel C), indicated by the orange arrow. In addition, some unknown tissue with islets characteristic
morphology with high intensity within stroma of CP tissue is stained, as indicated by violet arrows (panel C). In the pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma tissue, the EphA2 antibody stains cancer glands (red arrow, panel D) but not normal appearing tissues and ducts. Fibroblast
cells also stains slightly. Normal ducts indicated by blue arrow.

No negative side effects of the drugs were observed and
the mouse weight remained consistent throughout the
study. 3 animals per group were sacrificed at the end of this
study and tumors were excised and fixed in formalin for
future analyses. The remaining mice were sacrificed only
when they reached a moribund status. From this study we
observed that both Gemcitabine and YNH-L2-Gemcitabine
treated mice displayed a significant increase in the median
survival time compared to untreated mice (Supplementary
Figure S2).
Similarly, in a separate experiment we compared the
efficacy of equimolar doses of Gemcitabine and 123B9-L2Gem (Figure 3C, 3D). As in the case of YNH-L2-Gem, we
found that 123B9-L2-Gem was significantly more effective
than gemcitabine alone in suppressing tumor growth.
However, the median survival time of 123B9-L2-Gem
treated mice was significantly longer than both untreated
and Gemcitabine treated groups (Supplementary Figure S2).
This again suggests that the targeted delivery approach
may result in an accumulation of the drug in the EphA2
expressing tumor cells (See also Supplementary Figure S5).

clinical benefit to patients without undue toxicity. A Phase 3
clinical study in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
evaluated nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane) + Gemcitabine versus
Gemcitabine alone in a total of 861 patients. The median
survival was 8.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine
group vs. 6.7 months in the Gemcitabine group. The survival
rate at 1 year was 35% vs. 22%; 9% vs. 4% at 2 years. The
response rate was 23% for combination group and 7% for
Gemcitabine alone. Toxicities included neutropenia, fatigue,
and neuropathy [36]. These results encouraged the FDA to
approve the combination of Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel
for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Accordingly, in preliminary experiments we
investigated whether the efficacy of Gemcitabine against
pancreatic cancer as a single agent could be improved using
our recently developed targeted delivery strategy. First, we
developed drugs conjugates that are capable of specifically
targeting the EphA2 receptor, which is overexpressed on
the surface of pancreatic cancer cells. Initial studies used
Gemcitabine linked to the YNH peptide and its scrambled
control YDH-L2-Gem (Figure 1). Similarly, we synthesized
123B9-L2-Gem, in which the terminal tyrosine of the
EphA2 targeting peptide, which is essential to specific
EphA2 binding, was replaced with a bioisoster, resulting in
increased stability and longer half-life in vivo of the agent
[30]. Our previous studies demonstrated that YSA-L1palitaxel conjugates, when administered in prostate cancer

DISCUSSION
Though not overly efficacious, chemotherapy remains
the mainstay of pancreatic cancer therapy. There is a
vital need to develop novel therapies that provide greater

(PC3) xenografts bearing mice resulted in the accumulation
of the drug in the tumor, using extraction and LC/MS
analysis [28]. Here, we chose the L2 linker as we recently
studied in details the degradation of these conjugates in
plasma [29] and in vivo [30] and concluded that this linker
is stable and long lived compared to previously proposed
linker. In particular, the hydrolysis of the L2 linker and
concomitant delivery of the free payload started to occur
after 8 hr incubation of the conjugate with rat plasma
[29]. To further corroborate these previous findings we
conjugated 123B9 or a scrambled version with a near
infrared dye (Supplementary Figure S5) for in vivo imaging
studies. Similar to what previously found using LC/MS
analysis [28], we observed increased fluorescence in the
tumor site in mice bearing PC3 xenografts compared to mice
that received a scrambled-NIR conjugate (Supplementary
Figure S5) further supporting that the proposed targeting
agents can direct the payload at EphA2 rich tumor sites.
Hence, to investigate whether these findings in prostate
cancer could be translated to pancreatic cancers, we
subsequently evaluated the expression of the EphA2
receptor in a variety of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Most
cell lines tested exhibited elevated EphA2 levels and among
these we selected the MIA PaCa-2 cell line for subsequent
in vivo studies (Figure 2A). In addition, and perhaps of
most relevance, EphA2 overexpression appeared evident in
diseased versus normal pancreatic tissues (Figure 2B–2D).
Hence, we preliminarily evaluated the ability of these
novel targeting agents to inhibit tumor growth in pancreatic
cancer xenograft studies using the MIA PaCa-2 cell line.
Gemcitabine as a single agent at the chosen dose and
regimen did not exhibit significant efficacy compared to
mice treated with vehicle only as control, as indicated by
tumor growth (Figure 3). On the contrary, significant efficacy
was observed in the xenograft studies in mice receiving
either YNH-L2-Gem or 123B9-L2-Gem (Figure 3).
In addition, a significant increase in survival time was
observed in mice treated with 123B9-L2-Gem compared to
both Gemcitabine treated and untreated groups.
Our preliminary studies on the expression patterns
in pancreatic tissues from human biopsies clearly
indicated elevated EphA2 in the diseased versus normal
pancreatic tissue (Figure 2B–2D). The EphA2 antibody
did n’t appear to stain normal pancreatic tissue, whereas
staining of surviving acinar tissue and the stroma of
chronic pancreatitis tissue was evident. In addition, in
human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the EphA2
antibody clearly stained cancerous ducts and fibroblast
cells within stroma. These data strongly suggest that our
targeted delivery approach may be even more efficacious
in the natural micro-environment of the pancreas. In
conclusion, albeit at preliminary stages, our data support
the use of these novel EphA2-targeting drug conjugates
suggesting that they may provide an exciting new strategy
for pancreatic cancer drug development. Overall, these
studies provide encouraging evidence that conjugation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy to our EphA2 targeting agents may have
potential to improve clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer
patients. Additional studies on 123B9-L2-Gem and/or
YNH-L2-Gem as single agents or in combination with
nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), perhaps using more complex
genetically modified models of pancreatic cancers with an
intact immune system that recapitulate pancreatic cancer
development in patients, are warranted to further evaluate
these exciting perspectives.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis and characterization of EphA2
targeting agents conjugated with gemcitabine
All linear peptides and peptide mimetics were
assembled using standard Fmoc peptide synthesis protocol
with the Rink amide resin on 433A Peptide Synthesizer
(Applied Bio-Systems). In general, in each coupling
reaction, approximately 10 equivalents of Fmoc-amino acid,
0.45 M solution of HOBt/HBTU (9 equiv) in DMF, 2 M
solution of DIEA in NMP were used, for about 9 minutes.
Fmoc de-protection was performed with 20% piperidine in
DMF for 10 min. Each peptide was subsequently cleaved
from the resin and all protecting groups removed by
exposure to a 94% TFA, 2 % water, 2% tri-isopropylsilane,
2% phenol mixture for approximately 3 h. The TFA mixture
was subsequently removed under reduced pressure and the
peptides were precipitated in diethyl ether, centrifuged, and
washed with diethyl ether prior to drying in high vacuum.
The crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse
phase HPLC. The final compounds were characterized by
NMR and MALDI-Mass. All compounds were of > 95%
purity. EphA2-LBD and EphA3-LDB were expressed as
reported recently [30].
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) measurements
were obtained with Model ITC200 from Microcal/GE Life
Sciences. For in vivo studies, all drugs were diluted in 10%
Tween-80, 10% DMSO, and 80% PBS.

EphA2 expression levels in human cell lines and
tissues
MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, BxPC-3, and AsPC-1
cells were all obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). LT2 immortal normal mesenchymal
cells were purchased from Millipore. MIA PaCa-2 and
PANC-1 were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS.
BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells were maintained in RPMI plus
10% FBS. LT2 cells were maintained with media according
to distributor’s instructions. Cell lines were expanded and
cryopreserved at early passages and new vials were thawed
and used for experiments approximately every 3 months.
5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and treated as
described. After 48 hours, whole cell lysates were prepared
and western blotting analysis was carried out as previously

described [37]. Primary antibodies used for these studies
were EphA2 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling) and EF1-α (1:5,000,
Sigma). Representative data are reported in Figure 2A.
Normal pancreatic tissue (N-pancreas) chronic
pancreatitis tissue (CP), and Pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue were obtained from an
IRB approved protocol at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center
(34086) and probed for EphA2 expression using a rabbit
anti-EphA2, (ab78002, abcam, 1/200). Representative data
are reported in Figure 2B–2D.

5 × 106 MIA PaCa-2-luciferase cells were used to
establish bilateral subcutaneous tumors on the flanks of
8–10 week old male athymic nude mice. Studies were
done as previously described [33]. Treatment began when
tumors reached a palpable size (~50–100 mm3) with
9 mice per group. All drugs were administered by tail
vein injection twice per week for 4 weeks, for a total of
8 injections. Gemcitabine was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg
and all Gemcitabine derivatives were given at equimolar
doses to 10 mg/kg Gemcitabine (hence we injected
~70 mg/Kg of the conjugated having a MW ~7 times
greater than Gemcitabine), also via tail vein injection.
BLI measurements were performed at the beginning and
end of the study. During imaging, mice were placed in
the imaging chamber and maintained with 2% isoflurane
gas anesthesia at a flow rate of approximately 0.5–1
L/min per mouse. Anesthetized mice were injected IP
with 150 mg/kg body weight D-Luciferin (Xenogen
Corporation, Alameda, CA). After approximately 10
min, mice were imaged using a charge-coupled-device
(CCD) camera coupled to the Xenogen in vivo imaging
(IVIS) imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Inc.,
Hopkinton, MA).
Tumors were measured twice per week using calipers.
For in vivo studies, data shown are the mean + SEM
and for statistical comparisons we used the two-way
Anova analyses (GraphPad). After their last injection,
mice were kept for 1 additional week to monitor tumor
growth and imaged at the end of that week. The mice
were then kept to monitor for the effects of treatment on
survival. Mice were kept until reaching a moribund status
and they were then sacrificed at that time.
