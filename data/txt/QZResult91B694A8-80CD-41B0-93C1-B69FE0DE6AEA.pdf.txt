Abstract
Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family
member HER2 is found in f30% of breast cancers and is a
target for immunotherapy. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2, is cytostatic when added alone
and highly successful in clinical settings when used in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, HER2 tumors in patients develop resistance to
trastuzumab or metastasize to the brain, which is inaccessible
to antibody therapy. Previously, we showed that the green tea
polyphenol epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) inhibits growth
and transformed phenotype of Her-2/neu–driven mouse
mammary tumor cells. The different modes of action of EGCG
and trastuzumab led us to hypothesize that EGCG will inhibit
HER2-driven breast cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab. We
studied trastuzumab-resistant BT474 human breast cancer
cells, isolated by chronic trastuzumab exposure, and JIMT-1
breast cancer cells, derived from a pleural effusion in a patient
who displayed clinical resistance to trastuzumab therapy.
EGCG treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in growth
and cellular ATP production, and apoptosis at high concentrations. Akt activity was suppressed by EGCG leading to the
induction of FOXO3a and target cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p27Kip1 levels. Thus, EGCG in combination with
trastuzumab may provide a novel strategy for treatment of
HER2-overexpressing breast cancers, given that EGCG can
cross the blood-brain barrier. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9018–23]

Introduction
The HER2 (neu or c-ErbB2) oncogene encodes a 185-kDa
transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor family that is amplified or overexpressed in f30% of breast cancers and is a poor prognostic factor
(1). Overexpression of Her-2/neu in mammary cancer cells
activates the Akt kinase (2), which has been linked to enhanced
survival and chemoresistance (3). Targeted expression of Her-2/neu
in the mammary epithelia of mice resulted in mammary tumor
formation and metastasis (4). Trastuzumab is a humanized
monoclonal antibody directed against HER2, known commercially
as Herceptin, which inhibits growth and proliferation of cancer
cells overexpressing HER2 (5). Administration of trastuzumab
caused complete or partial remission in f12% of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cases where chemotherapy was previously
unsuccessful (6). When given as a single agent in the first line of

treatment in HER2-positive breast cancers, trastuzumab provided
an objective response rate of 40%, which included stabilization and,
occasionally, regression of the disease (7). When used after
adjuvant therapy with chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel
and doxorubicin, clinical outcomes improve substantially with
upwards of 60% of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers responding
(8). Furthermore, metastases rates were f50% lower in patients
treated with trastuzumab after initial adjuvant chemotherapy (9).
However, many patients respond only poorly to trastuzumab. In
addition, many other patients with tumors that initially showed a
response subsequently developed metastases to the central
nervous system (10), in part because antibody molecules, such as
trastuzumab, are inefficient in crossing the blood-brain barrier (11).
Our laboratory has shown that green tea extracts, which have
been found to be extremely safe in clinical settings, exhibit potent
antitumor effects in carcinogen-derived mammary tumors in rats
and epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol of
green tea, reduces transformed phenotype of estrogen receptor a–
negative breast cancer cells in culture, as evidenced by inhibition of
growth and induction of the p27Kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
inhibitor (12). EGCG also potently inhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar of the Her-2/neu–driven murine breast
cancer cell line NF639, which correlated with reduced autophosphorylation of the Her-2/neu receptor and decreased Akt-mediated
signaling (13). Similarly, EGCG inhibited growth of HER2-driven
BT474 and SKBR3 cells.3 Akt has been implicated in the control of
cellular proliferation, in part via repression of the forkhead box O
transcription factor FOXO3a. Under conditions where cells are
proliferating, FOXO3a is phosphorylated by Akt and exported to
the cytoplasm (14). On inhibition of Akt activity, FOXO3a becomes
hypophosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus activating
target genes, such as the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 , whose product
controls G1-S phase progression (12). Considering that mechanisms
of trastuzumab resistance include sustained Akt activity and loss of
p27Kip1 expression (15), here we investigated whether HER2–driven
breast cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab would retain sensitivity
to EGCG. We show that EGCG inhibits proliferation of trastuzumab-resistant human breast cancer cells and show that these
effects are mediated by the ability of EGCG to reduce Akt activity
and induce FOXO3a and p27Kip1.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment conditions. Trastuzumab-resistant human
BT474 breast cancer clones were isolated during a 5-month selection
process in the continuous presence of 0.2 or 1 Amol/L trastuzumab, BT/
HerR 0.2 clone D and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, respectively (16). Resistant cells
displayed high levels of HER2 and Akt, and Akt activity (16). JIMT-1 cells

were isolated from a pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic HER2driven breast disease that was clinically resistant to trastuzumab therapy.
JIMT-1 cells, which are epithelial in origin, displayed overexpression of wildtype HER2, formed xenograft tumors in nude mice, and retained resistance
to trastuzumab and a second HER2 targeting drug, pertuzumab (17). JIMT-1
cells were purchased from DSMZ and grown according to the supplier’s
protocols. EGCG (LKT Laboratories) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in
DMSO to maintain a constant DMSO volume in samples. Controls were
incubated in a volume of carrier DMSO equivalent to the highest dose of
EGCG. For cell counting studies, cells were plated in triplicate and grown
for 24 h. Following addition of EGCG, cells were grown for 72 h and
counted, and total cell numbers were plotted as a mean F SD.
CellTiter 96 AQueous proliferation assay. Cells were grown, in
quadruplicate, in the presence of carrier DMSO (0 Ag/mL EGCG) or EGCG
(40, 80, or 160 Ag/mL). At the indicated times, cells were incubated in the
presence of 20 AL CellTiter 96 AQueous One Reagent (Promega) per 100 AL
medium for 1 h and the reaction was measured colorimetrically at 490 nm.
Background levels were determined in medium supplemented with EGCG
at the appropriate dose and subtracted from experimental values and
findings were graphed as mean F SD.
CellTiterGlo ATP production assay. Cells, plated in quadruplicate in
96-well plates, were grown in the presence of carrier DMSO or EGCG for 72
h. An equal volume of CellTiterGlo (Promega) reagent was added to each
well and luciferase activity was measured in a 96-well luminometer. A
standard curve was prepared to determine ATP production in cells.
Background luciferase levels of medium with or without EGCG were
negligible.

Hoechst staining of cells. Breast cancer cells were plated on coverslips
in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h, EGCG was
added to the medium at the indicated concentrations, and the cells were
incubated an additional 72 h. Cultures were then washed three times with
PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution. Following treatment with 0.5%
Triton X-100, DNA was stained with 5 ng/mL Hoechst dye for 5 min.
Coverslips were then mounted on slides and dried overnight at 4jC in the
dark before visualization at 10 magnification using a Zeiss Axiovert
microscope.
Apoptosis assay. Cells were grown, in quadruplicate, in the presence of
carrier DMSO (0 Ag/mL EGCG) or high-dose EGCG (80 or 160 Ag/mL). After
72 h, cells were lysed and the level of histone cleavage from nucleosomes
was measured using the Cell Death DetectionPlus kit (Roche). Negative
controls were run in medium supplemented with EGCG at the appropriate
dose and subtracted from experimental values and findings were graphed as
mean F SD.
Green fluorescent protein growth assay. BT/HerR 0.2 clone D and
JIMT-1 cells were plated in duplicate in 12-well dishes. Cells were
cotransfected with 1 Ag pIRES-GFP and 1 Ag of either a vector expressing
myristylated Akt (Myr-Akt) or a parental empty vector DNA (a kind gift
of Z. Lou, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). After an
8-h incubation period, control carrier DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or EGCG was added
at doses of 40 and 80 Ag/mL and cells were incubated for a further 72 h.
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–positive cells and total cells were counted
under 10 magnification. The ratio of GFP-positive cells/total cells are
presented as a mean F SE normalized to empty vector untreated control
cells (set to 1.0).

10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 5 Ag/mL aprotinin]. Samples (40 Ag) were electrophoresed and subjected to immunoblotting, as described (2). Nuclear
extracts were prepared from isolated nuclei by lysis in extraction buffer and
samples (15 Ag) were subjected to immunoblotting. Antibodies for Akt and
phosphorylated Ser473 Akt (p-Ser473 Akt), and for p27Kip1 were purchased
from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Antibodies
for FOXO3a and h-actin (AC-15) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Sigma, respectively.
Statistics. Where indicated, ANOVA analysis was done to determine
significance.

Results and Discussion
EGCG slows growth of trastuzumab-resistant human BT474
breast cancer cells. To assess the effects of EGCG on growth of
BT/HerR 0.2 clone D and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E BT474 cells, which
displayed resistance to the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 Amol/L
trastuzumab, respectively, cultures were incubated either with
carrier DMSO alone (0 Ag/mL EGCG) or with 40, 80, or 160 Ag/mL
EGCG for 24, 48, or 96 h and proliferation was monitored using the
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Reagent cell proliferation assay (Fig. 1A).
For both clones, a dose-dependent response was observed. To
obtain a second measure of cell metabolism and viability, cellular
ATP was measured using the CellTiterGlo luminescence assay. This
assay assesses ATP production as a measure of cellular metabolism
and an approximate measure of cell number. BT/HerR 0.2 clone D
and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E cells were plated in quadruplicate and
treated with 0, 40, 80, or 160 Ag/mL EGCG, as above. After 72 h,
cells were assayed for ATP production. EGCG treatment caused a
significant dose-dependent decrease in ATP production in BT/HerR
clone 0.2 clone D and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E cells (Fig. 1B). Thus,
EGCG reduces the ability of trastuzumab-resistant BT474 breast
cancer cells to proliferate and to produce ATP.
EGCG reduces total numbers of trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells. The effects of EGCG treatment on total
BT/HerR 0.2 clone D and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E cell numbers
were determined. BT/HerR clones, plated at a concentration of
7.5  104 cells/mL (Fig. 2A and B, Dashedline), were allowed to
recover for 24 h before initiating treatment with EGCG. After
72 h, total cell numbers were determined (Fig. 2). Control
DMSO-treated cells almost doubled in number during the 96 h in
culture, consistent with the f100-h doubling time for the BT474
breast cancer cell line. Treatment with 80 Ag/mL EGCG resulted
in a decrease below the original numbers of BT/HerR 0.2 clone D
(Fig. 2A) and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E (Fig. 2B) cells plated. Further
decreases were seen with 160 Ag/mL EGCG treatment. If EGCG
were cytostatic, it would be expected that the cell density after
treatment would be similar to the starting number. The decrease
below 7.5  104 cells suggests that cell death has occurred as a
result of EGCG treatment.
JIMT-1 trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells were isolated
from a pleural effusion of a patient who was clinically resistant to
trastuzumab therapy (17). To assess the effects of EGCG on the
JIMT-1 breast cancer line, cells were plated at a density of 1.0 
105/mL (Fig. 2C, dashed line) and treated as described above.
Consistent with the f40-h doubling time, control DMSO-treated
JIMT-1 breast cancer cells nearly quadrupled over the full time

Figure 2. EGCG reduces the total cell number of trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells. BT/HerR 0.2 clone D (A ) and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E (B) breast cancer
cells were plated, in triplicate, at a density of 7.5  104/mL and JIMT-1
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells (C ) were plated, in triplicate, at a
density of 1.0  105/mL in 12-well plates. After overnight incubation, cells were
treated with either control DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or EGCG at the indicated
concentration. Total cell numbers were counted after 72 h. Dashed lines, starting
numbers of cells. Significance between final cell counts of untreated (0 Ag/mL)
and treated (40, 80, or 160 Ag/mL EGCG) samples was confirmed using
ANOVA (P < 0.001) for all three cell lines. The experiment was repeated with
similar results.

course. Treatment with EGCG caused a significant dose-dependent
decrease in cell growth and at a dose of 160 Ag/mL EGCG, cell
numbers decreased. Thus, EGCG slows growth of trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells at lower doses and may promote death
at higher doses.
Higher doses of EGCG induce cell death. Because the
decrease in cell numbers at the higher doses of EGCG suggested
that cell death was occurring, nuclear morphology and DNA
staining were investigated using Hoechst 33258. In healthy cells,
Hoechst 33258 stains DNA that is condensed and localized tightly
in the nucleus; however, in cells undergoing stress or dying, DNA
becomes fragmented and is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm.
In BT/HerR 0.2 clone D, BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 cells
exposed to carrier DMSO for 72 h, Hoechst 33258 staining was
quite visible and confined to the nuclear region (Fig. 3A, left).
However, on treatment with 80 Ag/mL EGCG for 72 h, dispersal of
DNA throughout the cytoplasm and loss of nuclear integrity was
observed in BT/HerR 0.2 clone D and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E cells,
whereas JIMT-1 cells showed lower but detectable levels of cytoplasmic DNA staining (Fig. 3A, middle). At a dose of 160 Ag/mL
EGCG, all three cell lines seemed to substantially lose their
nuclear integrity and Hoechst staining was quite broadly distributed (Fig. 3A, right). As another measure of the effects of highdose EGCG on apoptosis, we used the Cell Death DetectionPlus
kit, which detects cleaved nucleosomal components. BT/HerR
0.2 clone D, BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 cells were plated in
quadruplicate and incubated in either carrier DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or
EGCG at doses of 80 or 160 Ag/mL for 24 h. Background levels were
determined in medium supplemented with DMSO or EGCG. In all
three cell lines, DNA fragmentation was increased at 80 Ag/mL
EGCG and even further at 160 Ag/mL (Fig. 3B). Of note, JIMT-1 cells
seemed more resistant to apoptosis from EGCG, as was seen in
Hoechst staining (Fig. 3A) and cell numbers (Fig. 2). Thus, EGCG
induces death of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines at
higher doses.
EGCG inhibits constitutive Akt signaling and induces
FOXO3a activity and levels of p27Kip1. BT/HerR 0.2 clone D

and BT/HerR 1.0 clone E were found to retain sensitivity to the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, suggesting
the importance of PI3K-Akt signaling to trastuzumab resistance
(16). Previously, we showed that EGCG treatment down-regulated
Akt activity in Her-2/neu–driven NF639 mouse mammary tumor
cells (13). To determine whether EGCG treatment of the
trastuzumab-resistant lines similarly leads to inhibition of Akt
activity, BT/HerR 0.2 clone D, BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 cells
were treated with 0, 40, or 80 Ag/mL EGCG for 72 h. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion
with EGCG treatment in all three lines (Fig. 4A). Because the effects
at 40 Ag/mL were not as strong in JIMT-1 cells, doses of 60 and
80 Ag/mL EGCG were used next to characterize the effects on
FOXO3a, which is negatively regulated upon phosphorylation by
Akt (14). At these concentrations, EGCG treatment enhanced
nuclear expression of FOXO3a (Fig. 4B), which varied inversely with
Akt activity in the three trastuzumab-resistant lines, as expected.
JIMT-1 had the lowest levels of FOXO3a when untreated and
showed a modest increase on treatment with EGCG, which was not
quantifiable due to undetectable levels in the control DMSO
sample. The p27Kip1 gene is a major growth regulatory target of
FOXO3a (18). Because loss of p27Kip1 expression has been correlated with trastuzumab resistance whereas induction of p27Kip1
confers sensitivity to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer
cells (15), we next determined whether levels of p27Kip1 were
affected by EGCG. Expression of p27Kip1 in all three trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cell lines correlated quite closely with the
nuclear expression of nuclear FOXO3a.
To verify if the effects of EGCG were mediated via reduction
in Akt signaling, we asked whether a constitutively active form
of Akt can override the EGCG-induced growth arrest. BT/HerR
0.2 clone D and JIMT-1 breast cancer cells were cotransfected
with a GFP-expressing vector and either constitutively active
Myr-Akt or parental empty vector DNA. After 8 h, both empty
vector- and Myr-Akt–transfected cells were incubated in the
presence of control carrier DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or EGCG at doses
of 40 or 80 Ag/mL. After 72 h, GFP-positive cells were counted

Figure 3. EGCG induces death of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. A, BT/HerR 0.2 clone D, BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells were plated on coverslips in DMEM + 10% FBS. After an initial 24-h period of incubation in complete medium, cells were treated with either DMSO
(0 Ag/mL) or EGCG (80 or 160 Ag/mL), as above. After incubation, the washed cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution, extracted in 0.5% Triton X-100,
and stained with 5 ng/mL Hoechst dye for 5 min. Coverslips were then be mounted on slides and dried overnight before visualization using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope
under 10 magnification. Both phase-contrast and fluorescent micrographs are shown. B, BT/HerR 0.2 clone D, BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 cells were plated,
in quadruplicate, at a density of 1.5  104 cells/mL in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, cells were treated either with control DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or with 80
or 160 Ag/mL EGCG, as indicated. After 24 h, cells were quantified for apoptosis using the Cell Death DetectionPlus system. Columns, mean; bars, SD.

Figure 4. EGCG reduces Akt signaling in trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells and induces functional
FOXO3a and expression of p27Kip1. BT/HerR 0.2 clone D,
BT/HerR 1.0 clone E, and JIMT-1 breast cancer cells were
incubated in the presence of DMSO (0 Ag/mL) or the
indicated dose of EGCG. A, whole-cell protein extracts
were subjected to immunoblotting for p-Ser473 Akt, total
Akt, and h-actin, to control for loading. B, top, nuclear
extracts were subjected to immunoblotting for FOXO3a;
bottom, whole-cell protein extracts were immunoblotted for
p27Kip1 expression. Densitometric analysis was done on
immunoblots using the Kodak Digital Science 1D 2.0
system. Fold changes, normalized to h-actin, are
presented relative to the levels in the control (DMSO) cells.
The experiment was repeated with similar results.
C, BT/HerR 0.2 clone D and JIMT-1 breast cancer cells
were plated, in duplicate, at a density of 1.5  104/mL in
12-well plates. After 24 h, cells were cotransfected with
1 Ag pIRES-GFP and 1 Ag of either Myr-Akt or empty
parental vector (EV ) DNA. After an 8-h incubation, EGCG
was added to the medium at the indicated concentration
for 72 h. GFP-positive and total cell numbers were
counted. The ratio of GFP-positive cells/total cells are
presented as a mean F SE normalized to empty vector

and expressed as a percentage of total cells per field of view.
These levels were then normalized to empty vector control
levels, which were set to 1 (Fig. 4C). Transfection of Myr-Akt
conferred resistance to the effects of EGCG as measured by the
presence of a higher number of GFP-positive cells, suggesting
that down-regulation of Akt activity by EGCG is critical to
growth arrest of trastuzumab-resistant cells. Similar data were
obtained with BT/HerR 1.0 clone E cells (data not shown). Thus,
EGCG effectively reduces Akt activity and induces downstream
targets FOXO3a and p27Kip1 in trastuzumab-resistant HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells.
Our findings are the first to indicate that trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells display sensitivity toward EGCG. In particular,
EGCG treatment reduced cell proliferation, ATP production, and
Akt activity. Concomitantly, EGCG treatment induced nuclear
FOXO3a and p27Kip1 levels. At higher doses, EGCG induced
apoptosis. Pharmacokinetic studies of bioavailability of EGCG in
mice showed that it is widely distributed in all of the major

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

organs tested after a single i.v. dose (19). When EGCG was
administered through a gastric tube, the polyphenol or its
metabolites were detectable in brain after only 1 h and levels
continued to increase over a 24-h time course (20). Because
induction of p27Kip1 confers sensitivity to trastuzumab and
because EGCG can cross the blood-brain barrier, the sensitivity
of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells to EGCG suggests
that preclinical animal testing of combinatorial therapeutic
strategies is warranted.
