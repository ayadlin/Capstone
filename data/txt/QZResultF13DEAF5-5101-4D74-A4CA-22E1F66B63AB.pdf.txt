Abstract
Tumor suppressor p53 plays a major role in colorectal cancer
development. The present study explores the effects of p53modulating agent CP-31398 alone and combined with celecoxib
on azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and colon
adenocarcinomas in F344 rats. Maximum tolerated doses were
400 and 3,000 ppm for CP-31398 and celecoxib, respectively.
ACF and tumor efficacy endpoints were carried out on azoxymethane-treated 7-week-old rats (48 per group) fed the control
AIN-76A diet. Two weeks after carcinogen treatment, rats were
fed the diets containing 0, 150, or 300 ppm CP-31398, 300 ppm
celecoxib, or 150 ppm CP-31398 plus 300 ppm celecoxib. ACF
and colon adenocarcinomas were determined at 8 and 48 weeks
after azoxymethane treatment, respectively. Dietary CP-31398
was shown to suppress mean colonic total ACF by 43% and
multicrypt ACF by 63%; dietary CP-31398 at 150 and 300 ppm
suppressed adenocarcinoma incidence by 30.4% (P < 0.02) and
44% (P < 0.005), respectively, and adenocarcinoma multiplicity
by 51% (P < 0.005) and 65% (P < 0.0001), respectively. Dietary
celecoxib suppressed colon adenocarcinoma incidence (60%;
P < 0.0003) and multiplicity (70%; P < 0.0001). Importantly,
combination of low-dose CP-31398 and celecoxib suppressed
colon adenocarcinoma incidence by 78% and multiplicity by 90%.
Rats that were fed the high-dose CP-31398 or a combination of
low-dose CP-31398 and celecoxib showed considerable enhancement of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP expression, apoptosis, and reduced
tumor cell proliferation in colonic tumors. These observations
show, for the first time, that CP-31398 possesses significant
dose-dependent chemopreventive activity in a well-established
colon cancer model and that a combination of low-dose
CP-31398 and celecoxib significantly enhanced colon cancer
chemopreventive efficacy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8175–82]

Introduction
Epidemiologic and experimental studies indicate that the risk of
developing colon cancer may be attributable to genetic and
environmental factors, including endogenously occurring promoting agents (1–3). The p53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in

DNA damage repair, genomic instability, cell cycle arrest, and
apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of genes implicated in
these pathways (4–10). Although mutations affecting p53 are
present in >50% of all cancers, including colon cancer (4, 5), ‘‘stressinduced’’ nonmutational activation of p53 may occur very early in
cancer progression (6–8).
Several attempts to restore mutant p53 as a growth suppressor
included microinjection of monoclonal antibody 421, COOHterminal peptide of p53, and small molecules such as CP-31398 and
PRIMA-1 (11–14). CP-31398 can stabilize p53, protect against thermal
denaturation, and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (11). CP-31398 stabilizes wildtype p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and
degradation (15). In a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, CP31398 promotes binding of mutant p53 to p53 response elements
in vivo (16). Other studies using the purified p53 core domain have
shown that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant
p53 in vitro (17). Moreover, small-molecule modulators of p53, including CP-31398, appear to suppress growth of human colon tumor
xenografts (18) and prevent UVB-induced squamous skin cancer in
mice by restoring mutant p53 function (19). Recently, we have shown
that CP-31398 administered in the diet suppressed APCmin intestinal
tumors in a dose-dependent manner by up-regulating p53 protein
levels and downstream signaling molecules (20).
The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in colon carcinogenesis is
well established (21, 22). Previously, we have shown chemopreventive effects by the COX-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib in rodent
models of colon cancer (23, 24). Of particular interest is the observation that COX-2 metabolites, particularly electrophilic prostaglandins, appear to impair p53 protein function; COX-2 inhibition by
celecoxib increases the nuclear localization of functionally active
p53 (25). However, although efficacy has been attributed to COX-2
inhibitors, five clinical trials showed that three different COX-2
inhibitors caused an increased rate of myocardial infarction, leading
to concerns about the broader applicability of selective COX-2 drugs.
It is important, therefore, to develop strategies that target both COX2 inhibition and up-regulation of p53 in a clinical setting.
Our current study was undertaken to reconcile potential and
otherwise known toxicities by combining two agents, each with
different modes of action and proven efficacy, at much lower
concentrations than if used individually, to reduce toxicity and
enhance efficacy. Specifically, our proposed studies were designed
to test whether nontoxic low-dose celecoxib in combination with
nontoxic low-dose CP-31398 would provide better protection in a
well-established colon cancer model. The effects of CP-31398 and
celecoxib on colonic tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
expression levels of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP were also determined.

Materials and Methods
Animals, diets, and chemopreventive agents. All animal experiments
were done in accordance with NIH guidelines and University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–
approved protocol. Male F344 rats were obtained at age 6 weeks from Harlan
Laboratories. Ingredients for the semipurified diets were purchased from
Bioserv and stored at 4jC before diet preparation. Diets were based on the
modified AIN-76A diet. The semipurified diet includes 20% casein, 52% corn
starch, 13% dextrose, 5% corn oil, 5% alphacel, 3.5% AIN mineral mix, 1.2%
AIN revised vitamin mix, 0.3% D,L-methionine, and 0.2 choline bitartrate (26).
CP-31398 and celecoxib were premixed with a small quantity of diet, and then
blended into bulk diet using a Hobart Mixer. Both control and experimental
diets were prepared weekly and stored in a cold room. CP-31398 and
celecoxib were provided by the National Cancer Institute chemopreventive
drug repository. The agent(s) content in the experimental diets was determined periodically in multiple samples taken from the top, middle, and
bottom portions of individual diet preparations to verify uniform distribution.
Maximum tolerated dose. Experimental design to carry the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) bioassay is shown in Fig. 1A. To estimate the
appropriate dose level for the efficacy studies, MTD was determined by
feeding male F344 rats CP-31398 and celecoxib in a 8-week toxicity study.
MTD was defined as the highest dose that causes no more than a 10% body
weight decrement or produces mortality or any external signs of toxicity
that would be predicted to shorten the natural lifespan of the animal. At age
7 weeks, groups of male rats (9 per group) were fed the experimental diets
containing 0, 100, 200, 400, 800, or 1,600 ppm CP-31398 and 0, 500, 1,000,
2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 ppm celecoxib. Although celecoxib has been
extensively studied in animal models by several investigators, no systematic
studies have thus far been conducted on MTD of this agent in any animal
model. Body weights were recorded twice weekly for 8 to 9 weeks. All
animals were monitored daily for signs of toxicity such as ill appearance,
circling rashes, tremors, roughened coat, rhinitis, chromodacryorrhea, and
prostration. At the end of 6 weeks, mice were sacrificed and their oral cavity,
colon, small intestine, stomach, liver, and kidneys were examined for any
abnormalities under a dissection microscope.
Experimental protocol for CP-31398–induced colonic aberrant crypt
foci inhibition. The experiment was designed to evaluate whether CP31398 provides protection against the azoxymethane-induced colonic

preneoplastic lesions in rats. Experimental design is summarized in
Fig. 1B. Based on the MTD, different doses of CP-31398 were administered
continuously from 1 week before carcinogen treatment until the end of the
study. At age 7 weeks, groups of 12 rats per group (azoxymethane-treated
rats) were fed either the control diet or experimental diet containing 0, 100,
200, or 400 ppm CP-31398. At age 8 weeks, rats intended for carcinogen
treatment were injected s.c. with azoxymethane (Midwest Research
Institute) at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg body weight once weekly for 2 weeks,
and those intended for vehicle treatment received an equal volume
of normal saline. These dietary regimens were continued until termination
of the experiment 8 weeks after the second azoxymethane treatment.
Rats were killed by CO2 euthanasia, and all organs were examined grossly.
Colons were evaluated for aberrant crypt foci (ACF). For this evaluation,
they were slit open lengthwise from the anus to the cecum and then
fixed flat with mucosa on the upper side between filter papers in 10%
buffered formalin.
Quantification of ACF. Topographic analysis of the colonic mucosa
was done according to Bird (27) as routinely performed in our laboratory
(28, 29). After a minimum of 24 h, fixed colons were stained with 0.2%
methylene blue solution for 5 to 10 min, placed mucosal side up on a
microscopic slide, and viewed under a light microscope. Total number of
ACF in the entire colon was determined in every 2 cm section of the colon,
starting from the distal (taken as 0 cm) to the proximal end of the colon.
Aberrant crypts were distinguished from the surrounding normal crypts by
their increased size, increased distance from lamina to basal surfaces of
cells, and easily discernible pericryptal zone. The parameters used to assess
the aberrant crypts were incidence and multiplicity. Aberrant crypt
multiplicity was determined as the number of crypts in each focus and
categorized as containing up to four or more aberrant crypts/focus.
Chemoprevention of azoxymethane-induced colorectal adenocarcinoma by CP-31398 alone or in combination with celecoxib. The
experimental protocol is summarized in Fig. 1C. Two dose levels of CP31398 or 300 ppm celecoxib and a single low-dose combination of CP-31398
and celecoxib were evaluated for their chemopreventive efficacy. Based on
MTD and ACF studies, we selected 150 and 300 ppm CP-31398 and 300 ppm
celecoxib (<8% MTD), considering these doses to be safe for long-term
administration. Studies were designed to determine the efficacy of CP-31398
and celecoxib alone or in combination administered in the diet during the
post-initiation stage of azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis.

Figure 1. Experimental protocol for the
evaluation of MTD and chemopreventive
efficacy of CP-31398 and celecoxib in a rat
colon cancer model. A, MTD assay:
groups of rats (n = 9) were fed the control
diet (AIN 76A) or diets containing 100, 200,
400, 800, and 1,600 ppm CP-31398 or
500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 ppm
celecoxib administered at age 7 wk for
8 to 9 wk to identify the optimal dose.
B, ACF assay: groups of rats (n = 12)
were fed the control diet (AIN 76A) or
diets containing 100, 200, or 400 ppm
CP-31398 at age 7 wk; 1 wk later,
rats were given 15 mg azoxymethane
(AOM )/kg body weight s.c. once weekly
for 2 wk; 8 wk after azoxymethane
treatment, rats were killed and colons
were histologically evaluated for ACF as
described in the text. C, colon tumor
efficacy assay: groups of rats (n = 36)
were fed the control diet (AIN 76A)
at age 7 wk; 1 wk later, rats were given
15 mg azoxymethane/kg body weight
once weekly for 2 wk. After 2 wk,
azoxymethane-treated rats were fed the
control diet, 150 and 300 ppm CP-31398,
300 ppm celecoxib, or 150 ppm CP-31398
plus 300 ppm celecoxib for 48 wk
to assess colorectal adenocarcinomas.

Figure 2. Effect of dietary CP-31398 (CP ; A ) and celecoxib (Coxib ; B) on body weight gain of male F344 rats. Mean F SE (n = 10-12).

Tumor assay. Male F344 rats, received at weaning, were quarantined for
7 days and had unrestricted access to modified AIN-76A control diet.
Following quarantine, all rats were randomly distributed by weight into
various groups (Fig. 1C) and transferred to an animal holding room. They
were housed in ventilated cages with filter tops (3 per cage) under
controlled conditions with a 12-h light and dark cycle at 50% relative
humidity and 21jC. At age 8 weeks, animals intended (46 rats per group, 36
azoxymethane-treated and 12 vehicle treated) for carcinogen treatment
received 2 weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg body weight).
Vehicle-treated groups (12 rats per group) received an equal volume of
normal saline instead of azoxymethane. Two weeks after the second
injection of azoxymethane or normal saline, rats were placed on control diet
or diets containing two doses of CP-31398 and 300 ppm celecoxib or lowdose combination of both agents as outlined in Fig. 1C. Body weights were
recorded every 2 weeks until the 16th week and then every 4 weeks until
termination of the experiment 50 weeks after the last azoxymethane
treatment. Eighteen hours before the termination, 6 to 8 rats from each
group were administered 50 mg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)/kg body
weight i.p. to assess cell proliferation. Moribund animals were killed
and necropsied. Two rats in the control diet and one rat in the low-dose
CP-31398 developed ear duct tumors and these moribund rats were killed
4 weeks before scheduled termination. All organs, including intestine,
were examined grossly under the dissection microscope. Colon tumors
with a diameter >0.4 cm were cut into halves; one half was quickly frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC until analyzed for expression
and activity of COX isoforms and markers of apoptosis and cell proliferation. Remaining portions of tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin and processed by standard methods for histopathologic
evaluation (27).
BrdUrd assay for cell proliferation. We assessed the effect of CP-31398
and celecoxib on tumor cell proliferation by BrdUrd incorporation using
immunohistochemistry (24). Paraffin-embedded colons from different
treatment groups were cut longitudinally to 5-Am-thick sections and
mounted on microscopic slides. After deparaffinization, sections were
blocked for endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated with 1% milk.
BrdUrd antibody (Pharmingen) was applied at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h at
room temperature, washed and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG
for 30 min, and washed and incubated with avidin-biotin-complex reagent
(Vector Laboratories). After rinsing with PBS, the slides were incubated with
the chromogen 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine for 3 min and then rinsed and
counterstained with hematoxylin. Scoring was done by two investigators
blinded to the identity of the BrdUrd-positive cells at 400 magnification.

Cells with a brown nucleus were considered positive. The proliferation
index was determined by dividing the number of positive cells by the
number of negative cells and multiplying by 100.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay for apoptosis. Sections (5 Am) were cut and mounted on
slides, rehydrated, and stained using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method as
described in our previous publication (20). Stained apoptotic epithelial
cells (a minimum of 10 microscopic fields per section) were counted
manually in a single-blinded fashion. Scoring index will be similar to
proliferation index as described above.
p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Expression of p53 and p21WAF1/CIP in
colonic tumor tissues was assessed by standard immunohistochemistry and
Western blot methods by applying p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) primary antibodies.
Total COX and COX-2 synthetic activity. COX activities in colon tumor
samples (4-8 per group) were assayed using our previously published
method (30). Briefly, the microsomal pellet was suspended in 50 mmol/L
potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). To determine total COX activity, a 150 AL
reaction mixture containing 12 Amol/L [14C]arachidonic acid (420,000 dpm),
1 mmol/L epinephrine, 1 mmol/L glutathione in 50 mmol/L phosphate
buffer, and 25 to 35 Ag tumor microsomal protein were incubated at 37jC
for 15 min. To determine COX-2 activity, the reaction mixture was
preincubated with 150 Amol/L aspirin to block COX-1 activity and modify
COX-2 activity to 15-(R)-HETE. The reaction was terminated by adding
40 AL of 0.2 mol/L HCl. COX metabolites of arachidonic acid were extracted
three times with 0.5 mL ethyl acetate, evaporated to dryness under N2,
redissolved in chloroform, and subjected to TLC on silica G plates.
Metabolites of [14C]arachidonic acid corresponding to prostaglandin E2,
prostaglandin F2a, prostaglandin D2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a, and
thromboxane B2 were detected by their comigration with authentic
standards for total COX activity and [14C]-15-(R)-HETE for COX-2 activity.
Radioactivity was counted with a BioScan 2000 Radiomatic Detector and
results were expressed as pmol or nmol/mg protein/min.
Statistical analyses. All results are expressed as mean F SE. Differences
in body weights among groups were analyzed by ANOVA. Tumor incidences
(percentage of rats with tumors) among dietary groups were compared by
the m2 method. ACF, tumor multiplicity (number of tumors per rat), protein
expression and activities, and proliferative and apoptotic indexes were
analyzed by unpaired t test with Welch’s correction. Dose-response effect
was analyzed by linear regression (r 2) analysis. Differences were considered
statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
MTD and dose selection for efficacy studies. Effects of dietary
CP-31398 and celecoxib on body weight of male F344 rats are
summarized in Fig. 2A and B. Dietary administration of CP-31398
at 100 to 400 ppm for 9 weeks had no significant effect on the body
weights of rats. Dietary CP-31398 at 800 and 1,600 ppm for 9 weeks
appears to have resulted in no weight gain compared with
untreated rats, although the rats in question were active and
survived until termination of the experiments.
Rats fed celecoxib at 500 to 3,000 ppm for 8 weeks showed body
weight gain compared with the control diet group. At 4,000 ppm
celecoxib, rats had slightly lower body weight gain during weeks 2
to 4 but had significant body weight loss beginning at week 6 (P <
0.05) to week 8 (P < 0.01) albeit with no significant toxicity or
animal death. Based on these studies, we determined a MTD for
CP-31398 of 400 ppm and for celecoxib of >3,000 ppm but <4,000
ppm in male F344 rats. Chronic administration of CP-31398 and
celecoxib at their respective MTDs, individually or together,
produced no outward signs of toxicity nor any gross changes
indicative of toxicity in the organs examined.
Effect of CP-31398 on azoxymethane-induced colonic ACF.
The effects of dietary CP-31398 on azoxymethane-induced colonic
ACF formation are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Azoxymethane-treated
rats fed diets containing 100, 200, and 400 ppm CP-31398 showed a
significant decrease in the number of total ACF/colon (18-43%; P <
0.05-0.0005) compared with azoxymethane-treated rats fed a
control diet (mean F SE, 168 F 10 colon ACF), including, on
average, 31 of one crypt foci, 78 of two crypt foci, 35 of three crypt
foci, and 24 of four or more crypt foci (Fig. 3A). Thus, significant
dose-dependent inhibition of total ACF suppression, particularly of
ACF containing four or more crypt foci (17-63%; P = 0.08-0.0001),
was seen using dietary CP-31398 (Fig. 3B).
CP-31398 decreased incidence and multiplicity of colon
adenocarcinomas. The effects of dietary CP-31398 on azoxymethane-induced colon adenocarcinomas are shown in Fig. 4A and
B. Azoxymethane-treated rats fed a control diet formed colon
tumors at an incidence (percentage of rats with colon adenocarcinomas) of 74% and multiplicity (number of adenocarcinomas/
colon) of 1.42 F 0.21 (mean F SE; n = 36). In contrast,

azoxymethane-treated rats fed CP-31398 at 150 ppm inhibited
colon adenocarcinoma incidence by 32% (P < 0.02) and multiplicity
by 51.4% (P < 0.005); the corresponding values for CP-31398 at 300
ppm were 44% (P < 0.001) and 64.8% (P < 0.0003). A linear
regression analysis of CP-31398 dose against tumor multiplicity
yielded a statistical coefficient of r = 0.994 (P < 0.0001). Dietary
celecoxib at 300 ppm suppressed colon adenocarcinoma incidence
by 62% and multiplicity by 75.3% in agreement with previous
studies concerning the effects of celecoxib on colon adenocarcinomas (23, 31). However, combining low-dose CP-31398 (150 ppm)
and celecoxib (300 ppm) significantly suppressed colon adenocarcinoma incidence by 77.6% (P < 0.0001) and multiplicity by 89.8%
(P < 0.0001), which was statistically better than treatment with
celecoxib at 300 ppm alone (Fig. 4B). Administration of CP-31398,
celecoxib, or a combination of both significantly reduced colon
tumor volume compared with control (data not shown). Thus, the
combination approach using low doses of celecoxib with a lowdose p53-modulating agent such as CP-31398 provided significant
additive tumor-inhibitory effects.
Effect of CP-31398 on colonocyte proliferation and apoptosis.
The effect of CP-31398 and celecoxib as potential chemopreventive
agents was assessed by cell kinetics analyses. Figure 5A (top) shows
BrdUrd incorporation in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors
of rats fed CP-31398 alone or in combination with celecoxib.
Figure 5C summarizes cell proliferation results as measured by
BrdUrd-positive cells. Administration of dietary CP-31398 at
150 ppm inhibited the proliferation index by f25%, but this
inhibition did not reach statistical significance. However, dietary
CP-31398 at 300 ppm significantly suppressed the proliferative
index in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors (42%) compared
with control diet. Celecoxib at 300 ppm significantly suppressed
BrdUrd incorporation in colonic tumor cells (>52%). Importantly,
the combination of CP-31398 at 150 ppm and celecoxib at 300 ppm
inhibited colon tumor cell proliferation by >64%. Although
combinational agents–induced inhibition of colon tumor cell
proliferation is more compared with celecoxib alone, this inhibition did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.064). Figure 5B
represents the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling assay on colonic tumor cell apoptosis.

Chemoprevention of Colorectal Cancer by TP53 Modulator

p21WAF1/CIP1, presumably p53-induced, was observed in tumor
tissues of control diet–fed rat. Induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression
in the colonic tumors of rats fed 300 ppm celecoxib was observed
in f68% tumor cells, whereas colonic tumors of rats fed a
combination of CP-31398 (150 ppm) and celecoxib (300 ppm)
showed >85% of p21WAF1/CIP1 overexpression. Similarly, p53
expression in rats fed CP-31398 resulted in a dose-dependent
enhancement of p53 in colonic tumors compared with those
from rats fed a control diet (Fig. 6A and B). Further, celecoxib at
300 ppm also induced significant expression of p53 in colonic
adenocarcinomas. Significant synergistic induction of both p53 and
p21 protein expression was observed in rats fed with low doses of
CP-31398 and celecoxib (Fig. 6A and B).
Effect of CP-31398 and celecoxib on COX-2 activity. To assess
the potential interaction of CP-31398 and celecoxib with COX
enzymes, we determined the effects of CP-31398 and celecoxib on
selective COX-2 enzymatic activities and total COX isoforms in
colonic tumors of azoxymethane-treated rats (Fig. 6C and D). The
combined activity of COX-1 and COX-2 in colonic tumors of rats
fed the control diet was 36% higher than COX-2 activity alone. This
would suggest that f36% of COX-derived metabolites can be
accounted for by COX-1. Whereas dietary CP-31398 at 150 ppm did
not affect the activity of COX isoforms significantly, CP-31398 at
300 ppm showed modest but significant inhibition of both total
COX and COX-2 activity in colonic tumors (P < 0.02). As expected,
COX-2 activity in colon tumors of rats fed the celecoxib at 300 ppm
was inhibited by >66% (P < 0.0001). Importantly, the combination
of CP-31398 at 150 ppm and celecoxib at 300 ppm suppressed COX2 activity by >75% (P < 0.0001) and this inhibition is statistically
significant when compared with celecoxib alone (P < 0.04). In this
regard, prostaglandins E2 and D2, both of which have been
implicated in tumor cell proliferation, were the major metabolites
identified in these tumors.

Figure 5D summarizes the apoptotic index of colonic tumor
tissues. Dietary CP-31398 at 150 and 300 ppm significantly induced
colon tumor cell apoptosis (85% and 156%, respectively; P < 0.0050.0001) in a dose-dependent fashion when compared with colonic
tumors of rats fed with control diet. Colonic tumor tissues of
rats fed with celecoxib at 300 ppm showed 208% higher apoptotic
cells compared with colon tumors of rats fed with control diet.
Further, a combination of low-dose CP-31398 at 150 ppm with
celecoxib at 300 ppm resulted in a 293% increase of apoptotic cells
in colonic tumors compared with tumors of rats fed with control
diet. Importantly, a significant enhancement (P < 0.037) of
apoptotic cells in colonic tumors was observed in rats fed with
low-dose CP-31398 and 300 ppm celecoxib compared with
celecoxib alone.
Modulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53. Expression levels of p53

Discussion
Restoration of mutant p53 function and/or enhancement of
wild-type p53 expression by genetic means has been shown to
suppress growth of various tumor types (10, 18, 32). The
identification of CP-31398 and other small molecules such as
PRIMA-1 that rescue/activate mutant p53 could constitute an
effective pharmacologic approach for cancer prevention and
treatment (33–38). Although CP-31398 has been extensively studied
in in vitro models (9, 11–15, 18–20), only a few studies have shown
the tumor-inhibitory potential of CP-31398 in vivo (18–20).
Recently, we have shown f75% suppression of intestinal polyps
by dietary CP-31398 (200 ppm) in APCmin mice (20). The
azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis model in F344 rats
is well established and has been used to develop chemopreventive
agents for clinical trials (39), including celecoxib (40). Our primary
objective was to test whether low-dose CP-31398 would further
augment very low dose effects of celecoxib on colonic adenocarcinoma development.
Dose selections of CP-31398 for tumor efficacy studies are based
on a 9-week MTD assay. In the present study, effects of 800 and
1,600 ppm CP-31398 on the body weight of rats showed that highdose levels completely retarded weight gain albeit without
significant toxic symptoms or survival and/or food intake differences for 9 weeks compared with controls. We have determined the
MTD for dietary CP-31398 in male F344 rats to be >400 ppm, with
an applied dose of CP-31398 in colon adenocarcinoma equal to

f30% to 60% MTD. Also, we have evaluated MTD of celecoxib in
the present study primarily due to the fact that to date there is no
published preclinical data for this agent. As shown in Fig. 2B,
celecoxib administered at 4,000 ppm in diet showed 11.2% body
weight suppression without visible organ toxicities in rats. When
compared with other selective COX-2 inhibitors and traditional
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, celecoxib tolerability is very
high (4, 22–24). Previous studies from our laboratory and others
frequently used f1,500 ppm in the diet. In the present study,
we used 300 ppm celecoxib (f8% MTD), a significantly lower dose
(23, 24). Use of low-dose celecoxib is strongly preferred based
on human clinical trails showing that prolonged higher doses of
celecoxib are associated with increased prothrombotic effects and
risk of cardiovascular disease (40, 42–44).
Our results are the first to show that CP-31398 effectively inhibits
azoxymethane-induced colonic preneoplastic lesions (ACF) and
adenocarcinomas in the rat. These results further corroborate the
preventive effects of CP-31398 in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis
SKH-1 mice and intestinal neoplasia in APCmin/+ mice (19, 20). In the
skin model, CP-31398 was administered either i.p. or topically; in
APCmin/+ mice and in the present study, CP-31398 was administered
in the diet. By different routes of administration, CP-31398 showed
profound chemopreventive effects. In the APCmin/+ mice studies,
tumor suppression by dietary CP-31398 was more pronounced early
during tumor development (20). In the present study, dosedependent suppression of colonic ACF and adenocarcinomas clearly

suggests the potential usefulness of CP-31398 in chemoprevention
of colon cancer. The efficacy of CP-31398 in this study is comparable with several potential colon cancer chemopreventive agents
(e.g., celecoxib, sulindac, curcumin, oltipraz, and nitric oxide–
releasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and other agents
(23, 24, 30, 31, 45–47).
Another major objective of the present study was to evaluate
low-dose CP-31398 together with low-dose celecoxib in the
azoxymethane-induced model of colon adenocarcinoma. Our
results show that a low nontoxic dose of CP-31398 profoundly
enhanced the chemopreventive properties of low nontoxic dose
celecoxib. Remarkably, the combined efficacy of this regimen
compares favorably with the outcome efficacy of, for example, highdose (1500 ppm) celecoxib or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs applied at >60% MTD, or 4,000 ppm difluoromethylornithine,
an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor in rat colon cancer models
(23, 24, 45, 48). Thus, the combination regimen applied in this
study supports our previous low-dose combination approaches
to suppress colon cancers in a synergistic or additive manner
(31, 48, 49).
The importance of p53 mutations in colon cancers is well
established (4, 5). However, in the rodent models of colon cancer,
p53 mutations likely represent a late event in tumor development.
This may suggest that restoration/rescue of mutant p53 function
plays a lesser role in the tumor-inhibitory activity of CP-31398.
However, as shown here, limited expression of p21WAF1/CIP1,

presumably p53-induced, was observed in tumor tissues of control
diet–fed rats. Thus, although nonmutational activation of wild-type
p53 appears to play a major role during early colon tumor
development (8), further activation by CP-31398 might represent
yet another mechanism leading to suppression of tumor growth in
rat colon. In this regard, activation of wild-type p53 by CP-31398
has been shown in other models both in vitro and in vivo (11–19).
We have shown that dietary CP-31398 inhibited intestinal tumors
in APCmin/+ mice concurrent with induction of p53 expression and
downstream signaling molecules, leading to both inhibition of
proliferation and induction of apoptosis (20). Significantly, an effect
by dietary CP-31398 on collateral targets, such as, for example,
COX-2 in azoxymethane-induced colon cancers, presents a novel
mechanism.
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, there is mechanistic
rationale to test the combination of a p53-modulating agent with
COX-2 inhibitors. We and others have shown that COX metabolites,
particularly electrophilic prostaglandins, significantly impair the
translocation of p53 to the nucleus and that COX-2 selective
inhibitors facilitate this nuclear translocation (25, 50). Thus, the
present study provides mechanistic validation for the development
of a combination approach of p53 modulators with very low dose

COX-2 selective inhibitors such as celecoxib or other nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. Ultimately, combining low molecular
weight p53-modulating agents acting through different mechanisms, or combining agents targeting other molecular pathways
such as COX, is likely to substantially increase antitumor effects.
Taken together, these findings support further development of CP31398 alone or in combination with celecoxib for colon cancer
prevention and treatment.
