BACKGROUND: A prognostic index to predict induction death in adult patients receiving induction chemotherapy for
de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was developed. METHODS: The authors analyzed 570 patients (aged 16-70
years) included in 2 multicenter trials of the CETLAM Group to develop a scoring system (study cohort). The scoring
system was tested in 209 patients from an external single institution (validation cohort). Induction regimens consisted of anthracycline and cytarabine combination with or without etoposide. Induction death was defined as death
in the first 42 days without evidence of leukemic resistance. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of induction death
was 11% in the study cohort and 18% in the validation cohort. Median age was 48 years in the study cohort and 56
years in the validation cohort (P < .001). Multivariate analysis in the study cohort showed the following adverse risk
factors for induction death: leukocyte count >100  109/L, serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, and age 50 years. According to these factors, the authors developed a predictive score: low risk (no risk factors), intermediate risk (1 factor),
and high risk (2 or 3 factors). The cumulative incidence of induction death in the 3 respective groups was 5%, 13%,
and 26% (P < .001). The scoring system was applied in the validation cohort, resulting in cumulative incidence rates
of induction death of 6%, 19%, and 32%, for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk categories, respectively (P <
.001). CONCLUSIONS: By using this validated and simple scoring system, the risk of induction death in patients with
AML can be predicted accurately. The score may be helpful to design risk-adapted induction strategies. Cancer

Induction Death Scoring System in AML/Valcárcel et al

INTRODUCTION
Induction chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), the first step to cure this disease, is associated to
substantial mortality because of infections, hemorrhages,
and other toxic effects of chemotherapy or the leukemia
itself. Although supportive measures to prevent lifethreatening events (eg, transfusions and antimicrobial
agents) have improved in the last years, up to 10% to 20%
of patients die during the induction phase.1-4 Because the
identification of patients at high risk of induction death
may allow the individualization of the chemotherapy regimens and supportive measures, the development of a scoring system to predict the risk of induction death is of
interest.
Several risk factors have been associated with higher
rates of induction death, such as older age,1 high leukocyte
count,2,3 and bad performance status (PS),1,4 but only
few studies have been designed to build scoring systems to
predict accurately the risk of induction death based on
pretreatment patient and disease characteristics.5-7
Although demonstrating its prognostic value to predict
induction death in patients with AML, these scoring systems often include a high number of variables and may
not be easy to use in daily clinical practice. Furthermore,
these studies have been performed in series including
mostly elderly patients with AML,6,7 who are often considered unfit for intensive regimens. In addition, as far as
we know, none of these scoring systems to predict induction death has been validated in an external cohort of
AML patients.
The objective of this study was to identify the risk
factors for induction death in a large cohort of 570 consecutive patients treated between 1999 and 2006 in 20
Spanish centers of the CETLAM group (Grupo Cooperativo para el Estudio y Tratamiento de las Leucemias
Agudas y Mielodisplasias). By using these risk factors,
we aim to build a scoring system to predict induction
death. The external validity of the scoring system was
tested in an independent set of patients from a single
institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

consecutive multicenter Spanish CETLAM trials (LMA99 [N ¼ 324] and LMA-03 [N ¼ 244]). Age limits for
inclusion were 16 and 60 years in LMA-99 and 18 and 70
years in LMA-03. The LMA-99 induction chemotherapy
consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on
days 1, 3, and 5; etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2,
and 3; and cytarabine 500 mg/m2 twice a day by IV infusion over 2 to 3 hours on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Priming with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at daily
dose of 150 lg/m2 subcutaneously was added to the same
regimen in the LMA-03 protocol, beginning 24 hours
before treatment and lasting until the last day of chemotherapy. G-CSF was not administered or discontinued if
the white blood cell (WBC) count exceeded 30  109/L
and was started or resumed when the value decreased
below that level.
Validation cohort

This cohort included 209 patients diagnosed with
de novo AML (not APL) consecutively treated with
induction chemotherapy from January 1996 to March
2008 at a single independent institution (Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain). Induction chemotherapy
regimen consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to
3 and cytarabine 200 mg/m2 by continuous 24-hour IV
infusion on days 1 to 7, in 137 patients (66%). In 47
patients (22%), chemotherapy comprised mitoxantrone 10
mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 3 and cytarabine 150 mg/m2 by
continuous 24-hours IV infusion on days 1 to 7. The
remaining 25 patients (12%) received idarubicin 12 mg/
m2 IV or daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 combined
with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 by continuous 24-hour IV
infusion on days 1 to 7, plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on
days 1 to 3. Priming with G-CSF was not administered.
Supportive measures including anti-infectious prophylaxis and blood product transfusions were determined
by local protocols. Management of febrile episodes was
not standardized and varied according to the practice of
each institution. Written informed consent before chemotherapy was obtained according to institutional guidelines, and the research ethics board approved the
protocols at each center according to the Declaration of
Helsinki.

criteria10 in the LMA-03 trial. In the validation cohort,
the FAB classification was used before 2001 and the
WHO from 2002. FAB M0 and M7 AML subtypes were
immunologically confirmed.9,10 Results of cytogenetic
studies were categorized according to the Medical
Research Council classification.11 Patients with genetically diagnosed APL, as well as those with secondary AML
(ie, with documented antecedents of preleukemic disease
or exposure to leukemogenic agents) were excluded from
the study.
Remission induction response was assessed according to the recently revised criteria by Cheson et al.12 A
morphologic complete remission (CR) designation
requires <5% blasts in a bone marrow (BM) aspirate sample, an absolute neutrophil count >1  109/L, and platelets >100  109/L. Partial remission (PR) was defined as
the persistence of 5% blasts in BM but with a reduction
of at least 50% compared with diagnosis. If possible, those
patients received a second induction course identical to
the first course. Otherwise, patients not included in previous response categories were considered as resistant to
induction chemotherapy.
Induction death was defined as death from any cause
within the first 42 days from start of chemotherapy, unless
PR or resistance was observed (ie, patients dying in the
first 42 days in whom chemotherapy resistance was documented, as well as those receiving a second course of
induction chemotherapy because of PR, were not considered as having induction death). Causes of induction
death were determined after review of patient discharge
summaries, in-hospital reports, or autopsy results if available. Causes of induction death include the following
categories:
Infection, when death is because of a clinical, radiological, or microbiologically documented infection.
Hemorrhage, when a major bleeding occurs in a vital
organ (central nervous system, lungs). Gastrointestinal
hemorrhage requires massive melena or hematemesis
accompanied by fall in blood pressure.
Other causes, that is, any other cause not classified as
infection or hemorrhage.

formed in the study cohort to determine the possible
relationship between patient and disease characteristics
and induction death. The probability of induction death
was estimated by the cumulative incidence method (for
marginal probability),13,14 and was calculated from the
date of start of chemotherapy. Patients with resistance
before death in the first 42 days, as well as those starting a
second course of chemotherapy, were considered as having a competing risk event for induction death at the time
of resistance or start of the second course, respectively.
Age, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
creatinine, WBC counts in peripheral blood (PB), percentage of blasts in BM, and time between diagnosis and
treatment were analyzed as continuous variables in a Cox
univariate analysis. If any of these parameters was identified as statistically significant, the best cutoff value was
investigated. Other categorical parameters included in the
univariate analysis were sex, FAB subtype, treatment protocol, cytogenetics, presence of FLT3 internal tandem
duplication, and MLL molecular status. Characteristics
selected for inclusion in the multivariate analysis, using a
Cox stepwise logistic regression, were those for which
there was at least a trend for association in univariate analysis (P < .1). The variables remaining significant (P <
.05) in the multivariate analysis were used to construct a
scoring system to classify the patients in groups according
to their risk of induction death. The hazard ratio (HR) of
the logistic regression model was used to assign the corresponding score weight of every risk factor. To validate the
predictive model, patients of the validation cohort were
classified in risk categories according to the scoring system. The probability of induction death was calculated in
each risk category using the cumulative incidence method.
Computations were performed using SPSS version 15
(SPSS, Chicago, Ill), with the exception of cumulative
incidence analyses, which were carried out with NCSS
2004 (Number Cruncher Statistical System; NCSS, Kaysville, Utah).

considered resistant, and 37 patients (18%) died during
induction (of them, 35 died in the first 42 days after the
start of chemotherapy and were considered as induction
death).
The main differences between patients in the study
and validation cohorts were the higher frequency of
patients older than 50 years, levels of creatinine >1.2 mg/
dL, and lower frequency of FAB monocytic subtypes in
the validation cohort (P < .001, P ¼ .005, and P ¼ .003,
respectively) (Table 1).

Validation cohort

Causes of Induction Death
In the study cohort, 60 patients (9.5%) died in the first 42
days after induction therapy at a median of 20 (range, 138) days. The causes of death were infection (n ¼ 35),
hemorrhage (n ¼ 7), and other causes (n ¼ 18; ie, multiorgan failure [n ¼ 8], respiratory failure [n ¼ 5], renal
failure [n ¼ 2], cardiac failure [n ¼ 1], and indeterminate
[n ¼ 2]). Three patients died in CR after the first 42 days;
2 died of myocardial infarct after 45 and 99 days, and in
the third the cause of death was tuberculosis on day 66.

This cohort included 209 patients (45% female)
with a median age of 56 years (range, 16-70 years). Median WBC at diagnosis was 10  109/L (range, 0.6-385
 109/L). Twenty-two (10%) patients had a WBC count
>100  109/L. The median creatinine value was 0.9 mg/
dL (range, 0.25-2.4 mg/dL); 39 patients (18.7%) had a
creatinine value >1.2 mg/dL (Table 1). Overall, 128
patients achieved CR (61%), after 1 (n ¼ 113; 54%) or 2
(n ¼ 15; 7%) induction courses; 44 patients (21%) were

In the validation cohort, 35 patients (18%) died in
the first 42 days after induction therapy, at a median of 18
days (range, 1-39 days). The causes of death were infection (n ¼ 20), hemorrhage (n ¼ 6), and other causes (n ¼
9; ie, multiorgan failure [n ¼ 4], respiratory failure [n ¼
2], renal failure [n ¼ 2], and cardiac failure [n ¼ 1]).
Prognostic Factors for Induction Death in the
Study Cohort
In univariate analysis, the factors associated with an
increased risk of induction death were age 50 years,
WBC >100  109/L, serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, serum LDH >2000 UI/L, BM blasts >70%, and male sex
(Table 2). In the multivariate analysis, the variables that
retained statistical significance were age 50 years (HR,
2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.9; P ¼ .009), serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.8;
P ¼ .025), and WBC >100  109/L (HR, 2.3; 95% CI,
1.2-4.4; P ¼ .015) (Table 2).
Development of the Scoring System in the
Study Cohort
The scoring system consisted of 3 variables (age, serum
creatinine, and WBC), each with the same weight (1 point
for each if the value was in the bad risk category). Five

hundred fifty-four patients (97%) had all the scoring index
variables available. Three risk groups were established: low
risk (0 points, ie, no risk factors), intermediate risk (1
point, ie, 1 risk factor), and high risk (2 or 3 points, ie, 2
or 3 risk factors). The distribution of patients according to
the scoring system was as follows: low risk 43%, intermediate risk 46%, and high risk 11% (Table 3). The cumulative incidence rates of induction death among patients in
the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk categories
were 5%, 13%, and 26%, respectively (P < .001) (Fig. 1).
The relative risk of induction death in the intermediaterisk and high-risk groups compared with the low-risk category was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.3-4.8; P ¼ .004) and 5.4 (95%
CI, 2.6-11.4; P < .001), respectively (Table 3).
There were no significant differences either in the
cause of death or in the median days to death between the
3 groups (data not shown).
Validation of the Scoring System
All patients of the validation cohort had the 3 variables of
the scoring system available. Seventy-one patients (34%)

were classified as low-risk, 97 (46%) as intermediate-risk,
and 41 (20%) as high-risk patients (Table 4). The cumulative incidence rates of induction death were 6%, 19%,
and 32% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk
groups, respectively (P < .001) (Fig. 2). The relative risk
of induction death in the intermediate-risk and high-risk
groups compared with the low-risk category was 3.6 (95%

DISCUSSION
This study shows that induction death in patients with
AML can be predicted accurately using a simple and novel
scoring system based on 3 universally available patient
and disease baseline characteristics (age, leukocytes in PB,
and serum creatinine levels). The score was raised in a
large series of patients with de novo AML homogenously
treated with intensive regimens containing idarubicin,
cytarabine, and etoposide. The score was validated in an
independent set of patients from a single institution that
received induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and
Cancer

cytarabine (with or without the addition of etoposide).
This validated scoring system may allow selecting patients
with high risk for induction death to adapt chemotherapy
intensity and supportive care measures.
Many attempts have been made to establish the
patient and disease characteristics associated with a worse
outcome of induction chemotherapy in patients with
AML,1-5 but only a limited number of studies have developed scoring systems to predict induction death.5-7 Our
study differs from the previous studies in some aspects: 1)
it was performed in the context of a multicenter trial, in
contrast to those of Estey et al, Giles et al, and Kantarjian
et al, which were performed at a single institution (The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
[MDACC]); 2) the series of Gilles et al and Kantarjian et
al, were focused on elderly patients with AML and highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in contrast to
ours, in which only adult patients younger than 71 years
old were included, whereas MDS and secondary AML
were excluded; and 3) induction chemotherapy regimens
were relatively similar in all patients, in contrast to those
administered at MDACC (in many patients regimens
included investigational schedules with topotecan or fludarabine). We should highlight that our scoring system
was raised in patients treated with anthracycline plus
cytarabine regimens and therefore is only applicable in
this setting. Conversely, the MDACC studies analyzed
the predictive value of scoring systems using different definitions for induction death than in our study (death in the
first 42 days in ours vs in the first 28 or 56 days in the
MDACC studies). The main difference, and the most
innovative finding of our study, compared with previous
attempts, is that our scoring system was specifically developed and externally validated in AML patients.
Our scoring system was based on 3 patient and disease characteristics that are routinely available and that
have been previously reported as prognostic factors for
CR and/or induction death: age,1 WBC counts in PB,2-4

and serum creatinine levels. The high WBC counts may
increase the risk of coagulation disorders, pulmonary and
central nervous system leukostasis,3 and renal failure,
increasing the mortality hazard.15 Increased levels of serum creatinine have been consistently associated with the
risk of tumor lysis syndrome, which in turn is related to
higher rates of induction death.16 Conversely to WBC
and creatinine levels, age is a prognostic factor correlated
not only with an increased risk of induction death, but
also with increased rates of leukemic resistance to induction chemotherapy and with shorter remission duration.
In contrast to our findings, Greenwood et al4 reported that
age had no influence on induction death risk when WBC
and PS (measured by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group scale) were included in the analysis. This discordance may be explained, at least in part, by the close relation
between age and poor PS.1 We acknowledge that our scoring system could probably be improved by the inclusion of
PS and other relevant parameters (eg, comorbidities, presenting platelet count, coagulopathy, or uricemia).
Unfortunately, these variables were not available in the vast
majority of patients. The usefulness and applicability of the
present scoring system is limited, especially in elderly AML
patients, because of the noninclusion of comorbidities or
PS, and further studies are needed to show the real impact
of age versus patient health status on induction death. It is
possible, however, that the simplicity of our scoring system
is a consequence of the relatively limited number of variables that have been included in univariate analysis.
Concerning the risk stratification for induction
death, our scoring system classified AML patients in 3
groups, identifying a group with 5-fold higher risk of
induction death compared with the lowest risk group. Of
note, the study and the validation cohorts differed in
some baseline characteristics, the most important being
higher median age and creatinine levels in the validation
cohort. Consequently, the overall induction death rate
was higher in the validation cohort compared with the
study cohort. However, when the scoring index was
applied, the induction death rates were similar in both the
study cohort and the validation cohort according to the
risk category. In comparison with previous predictive
models, our scoring system is relatively simple, involving
3 variables that are widely and rapidly available in the routine clinical care. In fact, the predictive models of Estey et
al5 and Kantarjian et al7 consisted of equations with 8 and
5 variables, respectively. The study of Giles et al6 applied
to elderly patients with AML the comorbidity index score
previously developed for hematopoietic cell transplanta-

416

tion recipients by Sorror et al,17 based on 15 complex
variables.
Our scoring system to predict the risk of induction
death in adult patients with de novo AML might have
implications for patient care and health organization. For
example, high-risk patients might be referred to centers
with more expertise to receive rigorous supportive care (an
interesting approach in the setting of cooperative groups).
Also, elderly high-risk patients could receive modified
induction regimens with less intensive chemotherapy.
However, our scoring system is not optimal for the riskadapted implementation of specific supportive measures
(ie, antibiotic therapy or transfusions), as it does not assess
for the risk of specific life-threatening complications (ie,
infections or hemorrhages). In addition, the score could be
helpful in selecting obvious candidates for intensive chemotherapy, mainly those with low and intermediate risk of
induction death. However, patient selection depends also
on some variables predicting induction death that were not
included in our analysis, including comorbidities, PS, and
others. In addition, leukemic characteristics affecting the
chances of achieving a CR, such as cytogenetics and FLT3
internal tandem duplication mutations, as well as other circumstances (eg, patient, family, and physician preferences),
will influence patient selection.
In conclusion, our validated scoring system allows
easy risk stratification for induction death in the clinical
setting. This stratification may be helpful in designing
risk-adapted induction strategies in adult patients younger
than 71 years with de novo AML.
