ABSTRACT
RYBP is a member of the polycomb group (PcG) proteins that typically act as
transcriptional repressors via epigenetic modification of chromatin. The present study
was designed to investigate the role of RYBP in HCC progression, chemosensitivity,
and patient survival, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanism(s). In this
study we investigated the expression of RYBP in 400 pairs of human HCC tissues
and matched noncancerous samples. The effects of RYBP on HCC tumor growth and
metastasis and chemosensitivity were determined both in vitro and in vivo. We herein
demonstrate that the RYBP expression in HCC tissue samples was signiﬁcantly lower
than that in matched noncancerous liver tissues. Clinically, the low expression of RYBP
was an independent predictor of a poor prognosis in patients with HCC. In in vitro
HCC models, enforced RYBP expression inhibited cell growth and invasion, induced
apoptosis, and increased the chemosensitivity of the cells, while RYBP knockdown led
to the opposite effects. Furthermore, RYBP expression was induced by cisplatin, and
adenovirus-mediated RYBP expression inhibited HCC tumor growth and sensitized HCC
to conventional chemotherapy in vivo. Our results demonstrate that reactivating RYBP
in cancer cells may provide an effective and safe therapeutic approach to HCC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

agents, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin and 5-florouracil
(5-FU), have resulted in little or limited benefits [2].
A better understanding of the biological processes of
hepatocarcinogenesis has created a great opportunity to
identify molecular targets for more effective therapeutic
intervention. Recent studies have indicated that a loss of
tumor suppressor function and amplification/mutation
of oncogenes have critical roles in the development and
progression of HCC. Dysfunctions of several signaling
pathways regulating apoptosis in hepatocytes are unique
in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, providing novel

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common malignancies, and approximately 30,640 new
cases are diagnosed annually in the United States [1], with
a trend toward an increasing incidence and prevalence.
HCC is associated with a poor prognosis and limited
therapeutic options [2]. Surgical resection of the tumor
may yield a better prognosis for patients with resectable
disease. However, the current systemic chemotherapy has
produced unsatisfactory results, and several cytotoxic

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional
repressors that epigenetically modify chromatin and
participate in the establishment and maintenance of cell
fates [4]. These proteins are crucial for many biological
processes, including self-renewal and differentiation, and
cancer [5,6]. RYBP (RING 1 and YY1-binding protein)
is a newly identified member of the PcG proteins. RYBP,
which belongs to the non-canonical polycomb repressive
complex 1 (PRC1), functions as a transcriptional repressor
in mammalian cells by interacting with and repressing
the transcriptional activity of several sequence-specific
transcription factors, such as YY1 (Yin Yang 1), GABPB1
(GA-binding protein subunit beta-1) and E2F6 (E2F
transcription factor 6) [7,8].
Intriguingly, RYBP also has transcription repressionindependent (non PcG) functions [9-16]. There have been
reports showing that RYBP preferentially inhibits the
proliferation of malignant cells, but not non-transformed
cells, in vitro [9,11]. RYBP interacts with FADD (Fasassociated protein with death domain), caspase-8 and
caspase-10 through their death effector domains (DED),
enhancing the formation of the death-inducing signaling
complex (DISC) and promoting Fas-mediated apoptosis
[12]. Additionally, RYBP has been suggested to act as a
negative regulator of cell invasion [13]. RYBP has also
been suggested to be a target of miRNA-27 and 29, which
affect physiological processes such as skeletal myosis
[14,15]. Our recent study has identified RYBP as a novel
regulator of the oncogene MDM2 [16]. Mechanistically,
RYBP stabilizes and activates p53 by interacting with
MDM2 and decreasing the MDM2-mediated p53
degradation [16]. It also induces p53-dependent G1 phase
arrest and is involved in the p53 response to DNA damage
[16]. In our initial study with patient primary tumor
tissue samples, we found that the RYBP level is reduced
in human lung and liver cancer tissues compared to the
corresponding normal tissues [16]. However, the potential
role of RYBP in HCC is largely unknown.
In light of the previously published reports and our
preliminary findings, we hypothesized that RYBP can
be exploited as a novel target for human HCC therapy.
In the present study, for the first time, we systemically
investigated the levels of RYBP expression and the
linkage between RYBP deregulation and survivals of
patients with HCC. Using in vitro and in vivo HCC
models, we determined the role of RYBP in cancer cell
response to chemotherapy. We first found that RYBP
was downregulated in human HCC cell lines and tumor
specimens and that RYBP was an independent predictor
of survival in patients with HCC. We further demonstrated
that RYBP inhibited HCC cell growth through induction
of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. We also determined
the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on the RYBP
expression, and the role of RYBP in the chemosensitivity
in vitro and in vivo. The results of these studies provide

initial evidences supporting that the restoration of RYBP
expression may be a new approach to targeted therapy
for HCC and that RYBP may be a useful biomarker for
predicting the prognosis of patients with HCC.

RESULTS
RYBP is downregulated in HCC tissues, and
low expression of RYBP correlates with a poor
prognosis in HCC patients
To determine whether there was an association
between the RYBP expression in HCCs and the disease
outcome, we first examined the relative RYBP mRNA
levels in 52 pairs of human HCC tissue samples by
quantitative real-time PCR. Our results showed that
the transcriptional level of RYBP was significantly
downregulated in HCC specimens compared to
corresponding adjacent normal liver tissue samples
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A). Tissue microarrays (TMAs)
from 400 patients with HCCs were also examined
by immunostaining (Fig. 1B shows the staining in
representative samples). We found that 378 (94.5%) HCC
cases had positive tumor cell RYBP expression, with
varied intensities. There were 152 (37.0%) cases with
weak RYBP intensity in the tumors cells, 167 (40.6%) with
moderate intensity, and 59 (14.4%) with strong intensity
staining for RYBP. In contrast, the peritumoral liver cell
RYBP expression was strong in most cases (92.2%), with
the other 7.8% of cases having moderate intensity staining
for RYBP.
To evaluate the associations between the
RYBP level and the tumor biology, we compared the
clinicopathological features with the RYBP expression.
The patients with low RYBP expression were significantly
more likely to exhibit aggressive clinicopathological
features. For example, the RYBP-low patients harbored
more tumors with poor differentiation (p = 0.001) and had
increased serum γGT levels (p = 0.022) (Table 1).
There was an excellent correlation between the
RYBP intensity and the RFS (recurrence-free survival)
or OS (overall survival). The median follow-up period
was 52.1 months (range, 2.0–73.2; SD, 18.0). The RFS
and OS (in brackets) rates at one, three and five years
post-hepatectomy were 87% (92%), 70% (71%) and
54% (60%), respectively, for the whole study population.
As expected, RYBP-low expression (scores 0 and 1)
patients had a significantly poorer RFS and OS than did
the patients with RYBP-high expression (scores 2 and 3)
(Figs. 1C and 1D). The five-year RFS and OS rates were
61% and 66% for the RYBP-high patients, compared with
46% and 52% for the RYBP-low patients, respectively.
In a multivariate analysis, the tumor RYBP status was
defined as an independent prognostic factor for both

the RFS and OS. RYBP-low patients were nearly two
times more likely to suffer from relapse than RYBP-high
patients (HR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.45-0.85) (Tables 2 and
3). Thus, these results indicate that RYBP expression is a
valuable predictor of survival in patients with HCC.

RYBP overexpression and knockdown affect the
growth, apoptosis, and invasion of HCC cells
We also examined the RYBP expression in
immortalized human normal hepatocytes (CL48) and
hepatoma-derived cell lines. RYBP was expressed in all
hepatoma cell lines. In most of the hepatoma cell lines,
both the mRNA and protein levels of RYBP were lower
than those in the normal hepatocytes (Supplementary Figs.
1A and 1B).
Given the clinical significance of RYBP in HCC,
we wanted to know whether manipulating the RYBP
expression could lead to biological effects in HCC cells.
Our recent study shows that RYBP is a positive regulator
of p53 [16], but the possible p53-independent function
of RYBP may also be explored, which would provide a
complete picture for RYBP’s role in carcinogenesis and
cancer development and progression. Based on different
genetic backgrounds (p53 status and protein expression
levels of RYBP), three cell lines were chosen in this
study: HepG2 (p53 wild-type; RYBP middle), Hep3B
(p53 null; RYBP low), and Huh7 (p53 mutant; RYBP
high). First, HCC cells were transiently transfected with
the Myc-RYBP plasmid or siRYBP, and the cell growth
was determined by using the MTT and colony formation
assays. As shown in Fig. 2, enforced expression of RYBP
inhibited the cell viability (Fig. 2A, upper panel) and
colony formation (Fig. 2B, upper panel) of HCC cells in
a dose-dependent manner, regardless of the p53 status.
In contrast, knockdown (KD) of endogenous RYBP
improved the HCC cell viability (Fig. 2A, lower panel)
and colony formation (Fig. 2B, lower panel), independent
of p53.
To investigate how RYBP suppresses HCC
cell growth, we investigated whether RYBP impacts
apoptosis in HCC cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, transient
overexpression (OE) of RYBP induced dose-dependent
cell apoptosis (Fig. 2C, upper panel). In contrast, RYBP
KD cells exhibited low levels of apoptosis in all three
HCC cell lines (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Moreover, we also
examined whether RYBP has a role in HCC metastasis.
The transwell assays showed that RYBP OE substantially
inhibited the invasive activity of the cells, whereas RYBP
KD significantly promoted the invasive potential of HCC
cells (Fig. 2D). The levels of treatment (3 µg MycRYBP;
20 nM siRYBP, and 300 MOI AdRYBP) and treatment
time (24 h) used in the invasion assay did not cause
significant inhibition of cell growth or apoptosis, so the
effects of the treatment on invasion activity were unlikely

the increase in apoptosis, we observed that RYBP OE
increased the expression level of Bax and led to increased

However, RYBP KD affected the expression of these

that RYBP suppresses the malignant phenotype of HCC

of RYBP can lead to anti-tumor effects, we generated a

of HCC cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
3A); at a MOI of 1200 infectious particles per cell (IP/
cell), AdRYBP, but not AdGFP, inhibited the cell viability
by about 57% (P < 0.001), 43% (P < 0.001), and 44% (P
< 0.001) in HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, respectively.
The inhibition of cell colony formation was also observed
in HCC cells that were infected with AdRYBP, but not
those infected with AdGFP (Fig. 3B).
AdRYBP infection also induced apoptosis in all
three HCC cell lines, regardless of the p53 status (Fig.
3C). In the HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, treatment with
AdRYBP at a MOI of 1200 IP/cells increased the apoptotic
index by 5.1- (P < 0.001), 3.0- (P < 0.001), and 3.5-fold (P
< 0.001), respectively. However, no significant apoptosis
occurred in HCC cells infected with AdGFP up to 1200
IP/cells. Moreover, the suppression of cell invasion (Fig.
3D) was also observed with the AdRYBP treatment. In
addition, the expression levels of proteins known to be
involved in the apoptosis and invasion in HCC cells were
modulated in cells with AdRYBP infection, compared with
the controls (Fig. 3E).

Combing gene therapy and chemotherapy can
represent a successful approach for cancer treatment
[17]. To determine if RYBP affects the chemosensitivity
of HCC cells, we first tested whether RYBP OE would
sensitize HCC cells to treatment with cisplatin or 5-FU,
which have been the most effective agents used as
systemic chemotherapy for HCC [18]. As shown in Fig. 4,
RYBP OE improved the response to cisplatin, reducing the
IC50 values in HepG2 (6.2 ± 0.6 vs 3.4 ± 0.2 μM), Hep3B
(14.7 ± 1.1 vs 6.7 ± 0.3 μM), and Huh7 cells (9.9 ± 0.5 vs
4.0 ± 0.2 μM) (all P < 0.01; Fig. 4A). In contrast, RYBP
KD increased the IC50 values to cisplatin by 2.2-, 3.0-, and
3.9-fold in HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, respectively
(all P < 0.001; Fig. 4B). Similar results were observed in
RYBP OE or KD HCC cells treated with 5-FU (all P <
0.001; Supplementary Figs. 2A, B).
We further examined the effects of RYBP on the
cisplatin- and 5-FU-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. As
shown in Fig. 4C, 10 μM cisplatin alone increased the
apoptotic index by about 3.1-, 3.7-, and 4.3-fold in HepG2,
Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, respectively, compared to vehicle11610

treated cells. However, RYBP OE dramatically increased
the apoptotic index following cisplatin treatment by 5.0fold, 5.4-fold, and 7.7-fold, respectively, compared to the
control. In contrast, RYBP KD cells treated with cisplatin
caused 1.7-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.2-fold decreased apoptotic
index, compared to the control, respectively (Fig. 4D).
Similar results were observed in RYBP OE or KD HCC
cells when they were treated with 5-FU (Supplementary
Figs. 2C, D).
We also examined the expression of apoptosisrelated proteins in RYBP OE and KD HCC cells that were
treated with or without cisplatin. As shown in Fig. 4E,
cisplatin treatment induced RYBP expression. RYBP OE
enhanced the cisplatin-induced increase in p53 in HepG2
cells, and improved the cisplatin-mediated upregulation of
Bax and PARP cleavage. The RYBP KD reversed these
effects of cisplatin in HCC cells (Fig. 4F).

Similarly, combining AdRYBP with these
conventional therapies dramatically decreased the IC50
values (all P < 0.001; Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig.
3A). The combination therapy also resulted in significant
increases in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared
to cisplatin or 5-FU treatment alone (all P < 0.01; Fig.
5B and Supplementary Fig. 3B). The Western blotting
analyses indicated that the expression changes of several
apoptosis- and chemoresistance-related proteins by
AdRYBP infection could be responsible for the RYBPinduced chemosensitization to cisplatin in HCC cells (Fig.
5C).

Huh7 cells were treated with cisplatin and an RYBP plasmid (24 h) or RYBP siRNA (48 h), then the IC50 values were determined by the
MTT assay (A and B); apoptosis was determined by the Annexin V-FITC method (C and D); and the expression of RYBP and apoptosisand metastasis-related proteins was determined by immunoblotting assays (E and F). All assays were performed in triplicate (*P<0.05,

62% and 59%, respectively. However, the combination
of cisplatin with AdRYBP significantly reduced tumor
growth by 81% and 80%, respectively (Figs. 6A and
6B). Of note, there were no remarkable changes in the
average body weights in both animal models (Figs. 6C
and 6D) and no differences in histology examinations
among all the treatment and control groups in all the
normal tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and
brain) in the mice bearing the HepG2 xenografts (Fig. 6E),

To validate the anti-HCC effects of RYBP in vivo,
nude mice bearing HepG2 and Huh7 xenograft tumors
were treated by intratumoral injection of AdRYBP. Our
results showed that the AdRYBP treatment inhibited the
growth of HepG2 and Huh7 xenograft tumors by about
37% (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6A) and 49% (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6B),
respectively, whereas AdGFP treatment did not affect the

with cisplatin and an AdRYBP plasmid (24 h), then the IC50 values for cisplatin were determined by the MTT assay (A); cell apoptosis was
determined by the Annexin V-FITC method (B); and the expression of RYBP and apoptosis- and metastasis-related proteins was determined
by immunoblotting assays (C). All assays were performed in triplicate (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001).

indicating that AdRYBP infection was safe at the effective
therapeutic doses when used alone or in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents.
To investigate the mechanism(s) by which RYBP
reduces tumor growth and sensitizes HCC tumors to
cisplatin, we further evaluated the expression levels
of the various apoptosis- and metastasis-related
proteins in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7A, the results of the
immunohistochemical staining showed that treatment with
AdRYBP or cisplatin alone significantly induced RYBP

and E-cadherin expression. Additionally, TUNEL staining
demonstrated that there was an increase in apoptosis in
the tumors of AdRYBP- and cisplatin-treated mice. When
AdRYBP was used in combination with cisplatin, there
were more TUNEL-positive cells than that in the tumors
of mice treated with cisplatin alone. These observations
were further confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7B).
Consistent with the in vitro data, AdRYBP enhanced
the cisplatin-induced expression of p53, Bax and PARP
cleavage, suggesting that RYBP has an important role in

for changes in body weight as a surrogate marker for toxicity in both the HepG2 (C) and Huh7 (D) xenograft models. (E). At the end of the

and (6) RYBP sensitizes HCC tumors to conventional
chemotherapy through the induction of apoptosis both in
vitro and in vivo. In light of the present evidence related
to clinical cancer specimens and the pro-apoptotic role
of RYBP, we concluded that RYBP may be a potential
therapeutic target for HCC.
Integrative genomic profiling of human prostate
cancer has revealed several regions of copy number loss,
one of which spans the multigenic RYBP-containing
region at 3p14 [19]. Another study revealed that the
genetic loss of RYBP is associated with a poor outcome
after chemoradiotherapy in human cervical cancer [20]. In
contrast, RYBP was shown to be overexpressed in cases
of primary classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma and adult T-cell
leukemia, indicating a possible tumor type-dependent
expression and function of RYBP [21]. Of note, although
the loss of the RYBP gene has been reported in several
human cancers, these reports are very preliminary results
in nature. Most of the studies are just a part of gene
expression array and no mechanistic work has been done
in any of those aforementioned studies [19,20]. In the

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have demonstrated a novel
role for RYBP in the progression of HCC, and have
elucidated the relationship between RYBP expression and
the prognosis of HCC patients. We have made at least six
novel discoveries: (1) RYBP is downregulated in HCC
tissues and cell lines, and a low level of RYBP predicts a
poor prognosis in HCC patients; (2) RYBP overexpression
decreases the viability, inhibits colony formation, induces
apoptosis, and inhibits the invasion of HCC cells; (3)
apoptosis is the main mechanism by which the RYBP
exerts its cytostatic effects in HCC cells; (4) AdRYBP
infection decreases the growth of tumors in two different
HCC xenograft models, and induces RYBP expression
and modulates the levels of various other proteins, with
changes similar to those observed in vitro, regardless of
the p53 status of the tumor; (5) chemotherapeutic agents
induce RYBP protein expression in vitro and in vivo;

intratumoral injection every three days to nude mice bearing HepG2 (A) or Huh7 (B) tumors, and cisplatin was administered to the mice at 5
mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection once per week. At the end of the experiment, the tumors were excised, homogenized and further analyzed
for the expression of proteins of interest by immunohistochemistry (A, all images represented the series sections) and Western blotting (B).

present study, we used an extensive collection of HCC
tumors to demonstrate that the RYBP expression was
significantly downregulated in HCC tissues comparison
with non-malignant peritumoral tissues. A low RYBP
level was correlated with poor differentiation and an
increased serum γGT level. HCC patients with low RYBP
expression had poorer prognoses than patients with high
RYBP expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that the
RYBP expression was an independent and significant risk
factor for survival. Of note, although the present series of
HCC patients is well representative of a specific Chinese
population (HBV infection), they may not be easily
compared to HCC patients in other regions (e.g., USA,
Europe, Japan and Africa) where most of the patients are
infected with HCV and the vast majority of HCCs develop
in a background of cirrhosis with multiple nodules. It is
important that future studies validate our results with
different cohorts of HCC patients with different clinical
pathological features and from different regions, in
order to ultimately determine the usefulness of RYBP as
a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC
worldwide. Additionally, since all the patients included
in the present study were those undergoing surgery for
removal of HCC tumors, whether the current results
could be extrapolated to predict the clinical outcome
of unresectable HCC cases needs further investigation.
Currently, there are no randomized controlled trial (RCT)
showing any benefits from systemic chemotherapies
after resection in HCC. Thus, no uniformed, systemic
chemotherapies were administrated to these HCC patients
in the present study. Based on our in vitro and in vivo
data from the present study, we believe that combination
treatment with standard chemotherapeutic agents and
RYBP targeted therapy may provide a new avenue to
develop effective and safe management for patients with
HCC.
RYBP exerts tumor-specific cell killing effects, but
the underlying mechanism has not been fully investigated.
RYBP has been suggested to be an inducer of apoptosis
and a negative regulator of cell invasion [9, 13]. RYBP
co-localizes with high performance parallel interface
(Hippi) in a subset of neurons in the developing mouse
brain, and may mediate or regulate the interaction between
Hippi and caspase 8 [22]. RYBP also interacts with the
viral apoptosis agonist Apoptin, and has been suggested to
induce apoptosis preferentially in tumor cell lines, but not
in normal fibroblasts or mesenchymal cells [11]. The proapoptotic functions of RYBP were further demonstrated by
the fact that a high level of exogenous RYBP in Drosophila
induces apoptosis by promoting the aggregation of the
dFADD and DREDD (death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like)
proteins, and activating the expression of the pro-apoptotic
gene, reaper [10]. Similarly, mice homozygous null for
RYBP die shortly post-implantation, and do not exhibit
the normal apoptotic response accompanying implantation
[23]. In this study, we demonstrated that overexpression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of RYBP induces cell apoptosis and the expression of
apoptosis-related proteins, while knockdown of RYBP
attenuates this effect both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting
that the essential role of RYBP in inhibiting cell growth
may due to apoptosis. Our recent study demonstrated
that RYBP binds to MDM2, prevents MDM2-mediated
p53 degradation, and activates p53 transcriptional
activity [16]. In p53 wide-type cells, RYBP selectively
binds to MDM2 but not to p53, and the complex formed
between the three proteins potentially acts as a reservoir
of both p53 and MDM2. In response to DNA damage,
this ternary complex possibly undergoes modifications,
allowing release of p53 but not MDM2, thus reducing
the rate of p53 degradation. The free p53 then mediates
the transactivation of its downstream targets such as p21
and Bax, mediating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus,
RYBP promotes apoptosis by regulating p53 activity in
the cells with wild-type p53. In addition, RYBP binds to
several apoptotic mediators and enhances apoptosis [912, 22]. In cells with non-functional p53, it is possible
that RYBP also binds to Bax directly or it may have other
targets. Further in-depth analyses of additional RYBPinteractive partners are needed to better understand the
mechanism of action for RYBP’s anticancer activities,
especially in p53-independent manner.
In addition, the EMT plays a pivotal role in the
dissemination of malignant hepatocytes and metastatic
colonization [24]. The EMT is characterized by the loss of
epithelial cell-cell adhesion proteins, such as E-cadherin,
and the gain of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin
[25]. In this study, RYBP overexpression inhibited
hepatoma cell invasion, and decreased the expression of
E-cadherin and increased the expression of vimentin in
vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that the EMT might
be a mechanism by which RYBP can induce HCC cell
metastasis.
To date, almost all the available chemotherapeutic
agents have been studied extensively in HCC. Cisplatin,
5-FU and doxorubicin are most extensively studied agents,
showing the highest activity against HCC, but there is no
substantial success and consistent result demonstrating
that patients’ overall survival is actually improved [26].
Since the monotherapy response is commonly limited,
combination regimens have been studied in HCC. Among
these, cisplatin-based regimens demonstrate a response
rate of 28-45% and show a higher objective response
rate than others [27]. Cisplatin’s anticancer activity is
associated with its DNA damaging effects and induction
of cancer cell apoptosis [28, 29]. It has been reported that
cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis is mediated by various
signal transduction pathways, including death receptor
signaling and mitochondrial signaling pathways [28,
29]. In the present study, we performed a preliminary
evaluation of the therapeutic effects of RYBP by
examining the effects of AdRYBP infection alone or in
combination with cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Our

graded by the Edmondson grading system. The liver
function was classified based on the Child-Pugh scoring
system. The data were censored at the last follow-up for
patients without recurrence or death. The recurrence-free
survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were defined
as the interval between the time of surgery and that of
recurrence or death, respectively. Fifty-two pairs of fresh
frozen human primary HCC and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissue samples were obtained for a realtime quantitative PCR analysis of the RYBP expression.

results showed that cisplatin induced RYBP expression,
and enforced expression of RYBP sensitizes HCC cells to
cisplatin by inducing apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.
This combination regimen may provide an effective and
safe therapeutic approach to HCC therapy. There have
been a few previously published studies of the changes
in RYBP expression in response to chemotherapeutic
agents. For example, RYBP was shown to be upregulated
by trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA) in
v-FosFBR transformed 208F rat fibroblasts, a response
mediated through the inhibition of histone deacetylation
[13]. LAQ824, a small molecule inhibitor of histone
deacetylases (HDACi), upregulated the RYBP expression
in SKBr3 breast cancer cells through a miRNA27ainvolving mechanism [15]. In our previous study, we
showed that etoposide and doxorubicin induce RYBP
expression in an osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) [16].
In future studies, we will develop an optimized RYBP
activator that might eventually make its way to clinical
use following extensive testing in animals. We also plan
to evaluate the potential of using RYBP as a potential
biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, for
assessing the progression of cancer, and for determining
the response to therapy.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the
downregulation of RYBP in HCC is a strong indicator
of aggressiveness and a poor clinical outcome of tumors.
Uncovering the novel functions of RYBP will shed light
on the molecular mechanisms that regulate the growth and
progression of HCC, and also provide a new avenue of
research exploiting RYBP as a target for HCC therapy.

Archived tissue samples for tissue microarray
(TMA) construction were obtained for a consecutive
cohort of 400 patients who underwent surgery for
curative resection of heptitis B virus (HBV)-related
HCC in the Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University (Shanghai, China) between January 1,
2006 and January 1, 2007. The TMA study design was

were used for immunoblotting as described previously
[34-36]. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), and quantitative RT-PCR
and Real-time PCR analysis were performed. The primer
sequences used for the amplification of genes were as
follows: RYBP sense: 5’-tttgcccagaaagacagctt-3’; RYBP

5’-ggagtccactggcgtcttcac-3’ and GAPDH antisense:
5’-gaggcattgctgatgatcttgagg-3’ [16].

AdRYBP, a replication-deficient adenovirus vector
expressing RYBP, was generated as described [33]. The
pAd-Easy1 adenovirus system was kindly provided by
Dr. T-C He (University of Chicago). RYBP was subcloned
into the pAd-track vector and then recombined with
BJ5183/pAd-Easy1 competent cells by using the calcium
transformation method [29]. The recombinants were
identified and linearized with Pac I prior to transfection
into HEK293A cells. Fourteen days after transfection,
the viruses were collected and expanded for three cycles.
The viruses were purified (Clontech, Mountain View, CA)
and examined at different titers prior to further use. The
MOIs (multiplicities of infection) were based on the titers
determined for each cell line [33].

Tissue Microarray, Immunohistochemistry and
TUNEL Staining
Tissue microarrays were produced as described
previously [30]. All HCC cases were histologically
reviewed by HE staining, and representative tumor
areas were premarked in the paraffin blocks, away
from necrotic and hemorrhagic materials. Duplicate
1 mm diameter cylinders were included for each
case. Sections of 4-μm thickness were taken on
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APES)-coated slides.
The immunohistochemical staining of serial TMAs
was carried out as described previously [30]. Briefly,
sections were dewaxed, hydrated, washed and incubated
with primary and second antibodies. The reaction
products were visualized with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride and were counterstained with
hematoxylin. The RYBP immunostaining intensities were
scored as: 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong.
The negative grade represented no tumor cells showing
positive immunostaining. For the analysis, the RYBP
immunostaining intensities were classified as follows: the
sections scored 0 and 1 were defined as the low expression
group, and sections scored 2 and 3 were defined as the
high expression group. The apoptosis of tumor tissues
was detected using a TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick
end labeling (TUNEL)-based In Situ Apoptosis detection
kit (Trevigen, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [37].

Assays for In Vitro Anticancer Activity
Assays for cell viability (MTT assay) [34-36],
colony formation [35, 36], apoptosis (Annexin V-FITC
detection) [34-36], and cell invasion (transwell invasion
assay) [36] were performed as described previously.
In brief, 4-5×103 cells per well were transfected with
Myc-RYBP (3 and 5 µg), RYBP siRNA (20 and 50 nM),
AdRYBP (300, 600, 900 and 1200 MOI), or their empty
vectors for 72 h for MTT assay. For colony formation
assay, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1×103 cells
per well, and were transfected with different plasmids for
24 h, then the cells were grown for another 10 days. To
assess apoptosis using the apoptosis detection kit from
BioVision (Mountain View, CA), 2-3×105 cells were
transfected with different plasmids and incubated for 48
h prior to analysis. Cells that were positive for Annexin
V-FITC (early apoptosis) and PI (late apoptosis) were
counted. To determine the effects of RYBP on the cell
invasion, 2×104 transfected cells (3 µg MycRYBP; 20
nM siRYBP, and 300 MOI AdRYBP) were seeded into
the upper transwell chamber (BD Biosciences, CA)
for 24 h, cells on the upper surface were removed and
cells adhering to the lower membrane were stained with
Mayer’s Hematoxylin and Eosin solution and analyzed
under a phase-contrast Olympus microscope (Olympus
America Inc). The invading cells were counted in five
different visual areas and the area of positive staining was
measured using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus
6.0, Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD).

Development and Treatment of the HCC
Xenograft Models
The animal study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) of
the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Female
athymic pathogen-free nude mice (nu/nu, 4-6 weeks) were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA). To establish HepG2 and Huh7 HCC xenografts,
a total of 5 × 106 cells (in 0.1 mL) were subcutaneously
injected into the left inguinal area of the mice [34-36]. All
animals were monitored for activity, physical condition,
body weight, and tumor growth. When the tumor volume
reached ~100 mm3, the mice bearing HepG2 and Huh7

xenografts were randomly divided into multiple treatment
and control groups (10-15 mice/group). The in vivo
treatment was planned based on up-to-date literature
search and the real dose used in clinical treatment [26, 38,
39]. A total of 2×109 infectious particles (IP) of AdGFP
or AdRYBP were administered by intratumoral injection
every three days; cisplatin (5 mg/kg) was administered by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection weekly for about five weeks
(HepG2) or 3 weeks (Huh7) [40-42]. The control group
received the vehicle only. At the end of the experiments,
the xenograft tumors, hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys,
spleens and brains were removed, weighed, and snapfrozen for the Western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
and TUNEL assays.

Statistical Analysis
All preclinical data were analyzed using Prism
software version 6 (Graph Pad software Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). The Student t test was used for comparisons
between two groups. All clinical statistical analyses were
performed with the SPSS 18.0 software program for
Windows (IBM). Pearson’s χ2 test and Fisher’s exact
test were applied to compare qualitative variables, and
quantitative variables were analyzed by Student’s t-test or
Spearman’s ρ rank correlation coefficient determination.
A univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplan–
Meier method (the log-rank test). A multivariate analysis
was performed using a Cox multivariate proportional
hazard regression model in a stepwise manner (backward,
conditional). The model included all clinicopathological
variables found to have significant prognostic value in the
univariate analysis. A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
