BACKGROUND. Onycholysis occurs in approximately 30% of patients treated with
docetaxel. The efficacy and safety of an Elasto-Gel frozen sock (FS) was investigated for the prevention of docetaxel-induced nail and skin toxicity of the feet.

METHODS. Patients receiving docetaxel at a dose of 70 to 100 mg/m2 every 3
weeks were eligible for this matched case-control study. Each patient wore an FS
for 90 minutes on the right foot. The unprotected left foot acted as control. Nail
and skin toxicities were assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3) and compared using a 2-sample Wilcoxon matched-pairs
rank test adjusted for tied values.

RESULTS. Fifty consecutive patients were included between April 2005 and January 2007. Nail toxicity was significantly lower in the FS-protected foot compared

with the control foot (grade 0: 100% versus 79%; and grade 1 and 2: 0% versus
21%, respectively) (P 5 .002). Skin toxicity was grade 0: 98% versus 94%; and

Hospital, Poitiers, France.

grade 1 and 2: 2% versus 6% in the FS-protected and the control feet, respectively. The median times until toxicity occurrence were not found to differ significantly between the groups. One patient experienced discomfort because of cold
intolerance.

CONCLUSIONS. Cold therapy using FS significantly reduced the incidence of docetaxel-induced foot nail toxicity, as previously demonstrated using frozen gloves
for the hands. Cancer 2008;112:1625–31.  2008 American Cancer Society.

he taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel), have emerged as among
the most powerful classes of cytotoxic agents, exhibiting a wide
spectrum of activity against solid tumors including breast, ovarian,
lung, head and neck, stomach, and prostate cancer.1 Taxanes have a
predictable and manageable toxicity profile. Specific toxicities
include asthenia, alopecia, cutaneous reactions, stomatitis, fluid
retention syndrome for docetaxel, and neuropathy, myalgia, and
arthralgia for paclitaxel.2–5 Myelosuppression and hypersensitivity
reactions are common for both drugs. Cutaneous toxicity reported
with docetaxel treatment manifested as erythema and desquamation
of the skin of the extremities (hand and foot syndrome) and nail
changes.6–8 Although hand and foot syndrome does not appear to
be a common adverse event with docetaxel treatment,6 nail changes
were more often described with docetaxel than with paclitaxel, with
an overall incidence of approximately 30%.7 In a recent study performed in 55 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel, the incidence of nail toxicity reached 58% after 4 cycles, with
an increase to 88% after 3 additional cycles.9 A large proportion of

patients experienced the nail changes as a cosmetic
nuisance, and >32% had functional problems.9
Nail changes include hyperpigmentation, splinter
hemorrhage, subungual hematoma or/and hyperkeratosis, orange discoloration, Beau-Reil lines (indicating the cessation of nail growth), acute
paronychia, and onycholysis (the loosening or
separation of a fingernail or toenail from its bed).10
These abnormalities are in most cases not serious,
but hemorrhagic onycholysis and subungual
abscesses can occur, producing important morbidity.
These side effects can cause potentially severe complications because patients may become neutropenic
during chemotherapy, enhancing the risk of sepsis.
Functional disturbance can also occur, leading to
patients withdrawing from treatment. The type of
nail changes is related to the number of cycles of
chemotherapy, and to our knowledge to date few
preventive measures are available.11 Topic antibiotics
or antifungal agents may be required to treat nail
bed infections, which appear to be a complication
after the nail’s detachment.
In a previous study, we reported that the use of
an Elasto-Gel frozen glove (225 to 2308C) significantly reduced the incidence of nail and skin toxicity
of the hands induced by docetaxel administered at a
dose of 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, either alone or in
combination.12 The application of frozen gloves significantly decreased the overall occurrence of nail
toxicity from 51% to 11%, with onycholysis occurring
in none of the protected hands compared with 22%
in the control hand. Skin toxicity was observed in
24% versus 53% of patients (protected vs unprotected
hand), respectively.12 These favorable results warrant
additional studies to confirm the efficacy of cold protection in preventing nail and/or cutaneous toxicities
related to docetaxel.
To our knowledge, there are no data regarding
the incidence of specific docetaxel-induced toxicity
to the foot. The current matched, case-control, phase
2 study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety
of cold therapy in the prevention of docetaxelinduced onycholysis and skin toxicity of the foot.
Each patient wore a protective frozen sock (FS) on
the right foot and had no protection on the contralateral foot, which was considered the control side.
Using this method, it was possible to obtain a comparative incidence of nail and skin disorders with or
without cold protection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients enrolled in this prospective study were
undergoing treatment for a variety of tumor types

with docetaxel administered at doses of between 70
mg/m2 and 100 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, either alone or in combination
with other cytotoxic agents. Inclusion criteria were as
follows: no prior treatment with taxanes, the absence
of skin and nail disorders at the initiation of chemotherapy, a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 2. Patients were excluded if
they had Raynaud syndrome, distal bone or cutaneous metastases, ungual pathology, arteriopathy, cold
intolerance, or peripheral neuropathy (grade 2). All
patients provided written informed consent before
inclusion. The study was approved by an external
Ethics Committee and was declared to the French
National Health Agency.

Cold Therapy
Patients wore an Elasto-Gel (Akromed, France) flexible FS. This patented sock contains glycerin, which
has thermal properties that allow its use in hot or
cold therapies (Figure 1). The gel-filled sock covers
the foot to the ankle. Before use it was refrigerated
for at least 3 hours at 2258C to 2308C. For each doc-

etaxel infusion, the patient wore an FS for a total of
90 minutes on the right foot (15 minutes before the
administration of docetaxel, during the 1-hour docetaxel infusion, and 15 minutes after the end of the
infusion). The study was not blinded. Two FS were
used successively (for 45 minutes each) to maintain
a consistently low temperature of the foot. The left
foot was not protected by the FS and acted as the
control.

Toxicity and Patient Satisfaction
Onycholysis and skin toxicity were assessed before
each cycle of chemotherapy by the investigator (F.S.
or E.L.), and double-checked by a second observer (a
research nurse), using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC, version 3). The
NCI-CTC nail and skin toxicities criteria were
updated in the most recent version, the third one.13
The nail disorder categories were expanded into 3
grades, similar to that noted in hand and foot syndrome: grade 1, discoloration, ridging (koilonychia),
or pitting; grade 2, partial loss of nail(s) (onycholysis)
or pain in nail beds not interfering with function;
and grade 3, partial loss of nail(s) (onycholysis) or
pain in nail beds interfering with function, or complete loss of nail(s). Patient comfort was assessed
using a 4-point rating scale that determined whether
patients were: dissatisfied (0), not satisfied (1), satisfied (2), or very satisfied (3). The use of the FS was
prematurely stopped when patients experienced cold
intolerance, had a serious adverse event, or withdrew
consent.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was the efficacy in preventing
nail toxicity, and secondary endpoints were the
assessment of efficacy in the prevention of skin toxicity, time to occurrence of nail and skin toxicities,
and patient comfort. Analyses of toxicities were performed on the per-protocol population defined as
the totality of included patients, which used the FS
at least 1 time at the first cycle. The 2-sample Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test adjusted for tied
values was used as the main method to determine
the statistical significance of difference between the
incidence of nail and skin toxicities between FS-protected and unprotected feet. Because time-to-event
endpoints were used, Kaplan-Meier and log-rank
methods were used to estimate and compare differences in time to toxicity occurrence. Patients were
censored if no toxicity occurred at the end of chemotherapy or during follow-up. The impact on the time
to nail toxicity occurrence of some confounders such
as the ECOG PS, sex, number of cycles, and dose of

1627

docetaxel was studied using multivariate Cox regression analysis (forward stepwise selection). Hazard
ratios (HRs) were estimated with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). Medians with range and frequency percentages were estimated for quantitative
and categoric variables, respectively. No adjustment
for multiplicity of tests was performed. Subgroup
analyses were performed according to the docetaxel
dosing schedule: 75 mg/m2 and >75 mg/m2. The
relational database was created using FileMaker Pro
8.5 (vesion 2; Santa Clara, Calif) software. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15 software
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) and Epi Info (version 3.2.2;
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,
Ga).

RESULTS
Fifty consecutive patients were enrolled in a single
French center between April 2005 and January 2007.
One patient was found to be ineligible at the timeof
study entry because of previous taxane treatment. A
second patient withdrew informed consent before
the start of chemotherapy. Therefore, data for 48
patients were analyzed as a per-protocol population.

Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of the patients at inclusion are
summarized in Table 1. There were 36 men and 12
women, with a median age of 62 years, treated with
docetaxel for prostate (52%), lung (21%), breast
(19%), or other cancers (urinary bladder, head and
neck, primary unknown for 8% of cases). The majority of patients (88%) had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Docetaxel was administered either as monotherapy
(42%) or in combination therapy (58%) as a first-line
treatment for 69% of patients. The other agents in
combination were estramustine phosphate (56%),
carboplatin (16%), cisplatin (12%), and others (erlotinib, trastuzumab, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) in 16% of cases. The median number of cycles
administered was 5 (range, 1–9 cycles) and the median cumulative dose was 720 mg (range, 150–1260
mg). There were 4 different dosages at Day 1 of the
first cycle of docetaxel: 70 mg/m2, 75 mg/m2, 85 mg/
m2, and 100 mg/m2; the percentage of corresponding
patients were 38%, 29%, 6%, and 27%, respectively.
Twelve of 48 patients (25%) experienced a docetaxel
dose reduction, principally because of hematologic
toxicity.
Nail and Skin Toxicity

occurring in none of the FS-protected feet compared
with 21% in the unprotected feet (P 5 .002) (Table 2).
Onycholysis occurred in only 2% of the control feet
(Figures 2 and 3). Overall skin toxicity was registered
in 2% of the FS-protected feet versus 6% of the
unprotected feet. The difference was not statistically
significant (P 5 .18) (Table 2). The time until nail toxicity occurrence for unprotected foot was significantly associated with the total number of cycles of
docetaxel administered (HR of 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17–
0.77; [P 5 .008]); a borderline correlation was found
for ECOG PS (HR of 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09–1.10
[P 5 .07]). Patients with a poor ECOG PS presented
with a short time interval until the occurrence of nail
toxicity, with the risk found to be correlated with the
cumulative number of cycles of chemotherapy. Age,
previous chemotherapy, and the weight of the
patients were not found to be associated with the
risk of nail toxicity. The percentage of patients with
no nail toxicity at 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months
for the control foot were 98%, 81%, and 67%, respectively. No differences were observed in terms of time
to the occurrence of nail and skin toxicity between
protected and unprotected feet (105 days vs 87 and
101 days vs 101 days, respectively). An exploratory
analysis performed on the data of patients treated
with docetaxel in combination with different agents
demonstrated no impact of the introduction of a second drug on the endpoint of study (nail toxicity).

DISCUSSION
Taxanes are important drugs in the treatment of
breast, head and neck, lung, stomach, and prostate
cancer. Although nail and skin toxicities are not lifethreatening, clinicians should manage these particular side effects that could lead to an impairment of
quality of life and early discontinuation of chemotherapy.14 Nail toxicity is now considered an important issue in taxane therapy. Even weekly schedules

of docetaxel demonstrated a potential risk of nail
toxicity, as demonstrated by a review performed in
breast cancer patients.15 Not only taxanes are associated with important nail changes; antiangiogenic
agents such as sunitinib and sorafenib were associated with distal subungual splinter hemorrhages in
30% and 60% of cases, respectively.16
Cold temperature had been found to decrease
the toxicity (incidence and severity) of some cytotoxic
agents as a direct consequence of the induced vasoconstriction, associated with a temporary decrease of
blood flow. This approach was applied to prevent alopecia with the use of cold caps17,18 and to prevent 5fluorouracil-related mucositis using oral cryotherapy.19 The same concept was successfully tested for
the prevention of nail and skin toxicities induced by
docetaxel using an Elasto-Gel flexible frozen glove12
and therefore was extended in the current study to
nail changes of the foot using a similar FS.
This matched, case-control, phase 2 study, performed in 45 patients with solid tumors who were
treated with docetaxel-based regimens, demonstrated
the feasibility and efficacy of cold therapy using the
Elasto-Gel flexible FS to prevent docetaxel-induced
nail toxicity of the foot. We believe the usefulness of
cold therapy in preventing docetaxel-induced nail
toxicity was confirmed and validated in the current
study. The use of an FS reduced the incidence and
intensity of nail toxicity associated with docetaxel,
administered every 3 weeks, alone or in combination.
No nail toxicity was observed in the FS-protected
foot compared with an incidence of 21% in the control foot, including dischromia and onycholysis for
19% and 2% of cases, respectively. The incidence of
skin toxicity was also reduced, but this finding was
not statistically significant. Few patients presented
grade 1 or 2 skin toxicity in the control group. In
daily clinical practice, feet are less frequently affected
than the hands by docetaxel-induced nail changes.
This may be because of sock wear and light exposure

prevention. In the previous study assessing frozen
gloves, grade 1 and 2 nail toxicity occurred in 29%
and 22% of the unprotected hand (compared with
19% and 2% in the unprotected foot of the current
study), respectively. Grade 1 and 2 skin toxicity
occurred in 44% and 9% of the control hand, compared with 4% and 2% in the control feet, respectively.12 The appearance of nail and/or skin toxicities
of the foot was not significantly delayed by cold therapy, as had been observed using the frozen gloves.
Overall, it appears that the FS was less effective, but
the results are still statistically significant despite the
small sample size for this cohort of patients.
The global comfort of patients as well as the
cold tolerance assessed using a 4-point rating scale
were excellent; only 1 patient was not satisfied with
the FS, experiencing cold intolerance. These safety
results appeared better than those obtained in the
frozen gloves study, in which 14% of patients were
dissatisfied, including 11% of those who withdrew
from the study because of cold intolerance during
glove contact.12 Therefore, the FS appears to be better tolerated than the gloves.
To our knowledge, the physiopathology of nail
toxicity is actually unknown. Some studies have suggested that the antiangiogenic properties of taxanes
may be involved,20,21 whereas another study hints at
the existence of a neurogenically mediated inflammatory process.22 De Giorgi et al.23 suggested that
onycholysis might represent a side effect related to
the vehicle cremophor for paclitaxel or Tween 80 for
docetaxel, possibly through neurotoxic damage.
To our knowledge to date, no effective preventive
measures are available to avoid taxane-induced nail
changes. This technique, using Elasto-Gel frozen
gloves and/or socks, is easy to apply and is well tolerated by the patients, with no major side effects
reported. It may be recommended for routine use
with taxane-based therapies and should be considered as a new valuable tool in supportive care.
Because the FS did not affect skin toxicity, a modified version of the sock, covering only toes and nails,
should be tested. The cold therapy must be tested
with other cytotoxic agents known to be associated
with important nail and skin toxicities such as liposomal doxorubicin. A similar study is ongoing in our
center and the results will be presented in the near
future.
