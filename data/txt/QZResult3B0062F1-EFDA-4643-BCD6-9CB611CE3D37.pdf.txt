Abstract
The developmental receptor NOTCH plays an important role in various human cancers as a consequence of
oncogenic mutations. Here we describe a novel mechanism of NOTCH-induced tumor suppression involving
modulation of the deacetylase SIRT1, providing a rationale for the use of SIRT1 inhibitors to treat cancers where
this mechanism is inactivated because of SIRT1 overexpression. In Ewing sarcoma cells, NOTCH signaling is
abrogated by the driver oncogene EWS-FLI1. Restoration of NOTCH signaling caused growth arrest due to
activation of the NOTCH effector HEY1, directly suppressing SIRT1 and thereby activating p53. This mechanism of
tumor suppression was validated in Ewing sarcoma cells, B-cell tumors, and human keratinocytes where NOTCH
dysregulation has been implicated pathogenically. Notably, the SIRT1/2 inhibitor Tenovin-6 killed Ewing sarcoma
cells in vitro and prohibited tumor growth and spread in an established xenograft model in zebraﬁsh. Using
immunohistochemistry to analyze primary tissue specimens, we found that high SIRT1 expression was associated
with Ewing sarcoma metastasis and poor prognosis. Our ﬁndings suggest a mechanistic rationale for the use of
SIRT1 inhibitors being developed to treat metastatic disease in patients with Ewing sarcoma. Cancer Res; 74(22);

Introduction
NOTCH signaling is an evolutionary conserved pathway
involved in tissue patterning and cell speciﬁcation during
normal development. It is initiated following interaction of a
cell surface expressed ligand (JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, 3 and 4)
with a transmembrane monomeric NOTCH receptor
(NOTCH1–4). Binding of the ligand is followed by two
successive proteolytic cleavage steps catalyzed by TNFaconverting enzyme and the presenilin-g secretase complex

that release the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) to the
cytoplasm. Upon translocation to the nucleus, NICD activates the transcription factor CSL. The amplitude and
duration of the NOTCH response are regulated by acetylation of NICD on speciﬁc lysine residues (1). Only few CSL
targets are known, most prominently the HES and HEY
family of transcriptional repressors. In many mammalian
cell types, the NOTCH pathway enhances stem cell potential
and suppresses differentiation, whereas in others, it exerts
an opposite role suppressing tumor development (2). Oncogenic NOTCH pathway activation by mutation occurs in
many cancers including T-cell leukemia and a variety of solid
tumors including breast, colorectal, ovarian, and non–small
cell lung cancers. Accordingly, a number of pharmacologic
NOTCH inhibitors are currently in early clinical development. However, the consequences of activated NOTCH
signaling are cell-type–speciﬁc and there is a growing list
of tissues and neoplasms in which NOTCH activation has a
tumor-suppressive effect, including keratinocytes, tumors of
the prostate, liver, skin, lung, gastrointestinal stromal
tumors, a wide range of B-cell malignancies, and in Ewing
sarcoma (3). Currently, the mechanisms of tumor-suppressive NOTCH signaling remain unknown.
Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis is driven by the chimeric
ETS oncogene EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 acts as an aberrant
oncogenic transcription factor with both activating and
repressive gene regulatory properties (4). We have previously

SIRT1 in Tumor-Suppressive NOTCH Response

reported that EWS-FLI1 represses JAG1 expression keeping
NOTCH signaling off (5). We found that silencing of EWSFLI1 results in activation of tumor cell autonomous NOTCH
signaling, leading to a strong transcriptional induction
of HEY1, which was paralleled by activation of the tumor
suppressor TP53 and consequently upregulation of the cellcycle inhibitor p21 and cell-cycle arrest (3). We showed that
HEY1 was sufﬁcient to elicit a TP53 response in Ewing
sarcoma cell lines, but the mechanism of TP53 activation
remained unknown.
We here demonstrate that knockdown of EWS-FLI1 and
induction of HEY1 result in TP53 acetylation. Carboxy terminal
acetylation by p300 was demonstrated to be essential for TP53
transcriptional activity (6). Consequently, factors that lead to
deacetylation of TP53 interfere with TP53 stress response (7).
We now report SIRT1 as a HEY1-repressed deacetylase preventing TP53 acetylation downstream of suppressed NOTCH
signaling in Ewing sarcoma and other tissues in which NOTCH
acts tumor suppressive.
Sirtuins are an evolutionary highly conserved protein
family homologous to yeast silent information regulator 2
(sir2) and link cellular metabolism to tissue homeostasis and
differentiation. Sirtuins have recently attracted considerable
interest due to their role in inﬂammation, protection from
neurodegenerative diseases, organismal longevity, and their
emerging importance for cancer (8). Of the seven members
of this family in man, SIRT1, 3, 6, and 7 localize mainly to the
nucleus, whereas SIRT2 resides exclusively in the cytoplasm
and SIRT4 and 5 in mitochondria. SIRT1, 2, 3, and 5 catalyze
NADþ-dependent deacetylation of targets, whereas SIRT4
and 6 mediate ADP-ribosylation of protein substrates. SIRT1
has originally been identiﬁed as a class III histone deacetylase removing histone H1K26, H3K9, H3K56, and H4K16
acetylation marks, thus facilitating heterochromatin formation. In addition, it plays a role in the repression of euchromatic gene regulation as part of a corepressor complex with
the demethylase LSD1 and associated proteins. Among
others, this complex binds to CSL and represses genes
regulated by the NOTCH signaling pathway including HEY1
(9). In addition, SIRT1 can modulate NICD activity by
deacetylation as demonstrated in endothelial cells (1). Gene
regulation by SIRT1 is also affected by deacetylation of other
transcription factors including AR, FOXO, E2F1, HIC1, BCL6,
NF-kB, and notably TP53 (for review, see ref. 10). SIRT1
physically interacts with TP53 and deacetylates Lys382, thus
reducing the transcriptional activity of TP53 (7, 11). Knockdown of SIRT1 allows for TP53 acetylation, which is an
indispensable prerequisite for the destabilization of the
TP53–MDM2 interaction, inducing transcriptional activity
and enabling TP53 stress response (12).
We here report that modulation of SIRT1 by HEY1 provides a
feedback mechanism that couples NOTCH signaling to TP53
activation in tissues in which NOTCH activity acts tumor
suppressive. We demonstrate that in Ewing sarcoma, SIRT1
expression is speciﬁcally conﬁned to metastases and that
pharmacologic inhibition of SIRT1 activity efﬁciently kills
SIRT1-positive Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and prohibits
growth and migration of tumor cells in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, transfections, and drug treatments
Cell lines of this study are summarized in Supplementary
Table S4A. All cell lines were veriﬁed by short tandem repeat
(STR) analysis and are routinely subjected to mycoplasma
and SMRV testing in regular intervals. Ewing sarcoma cell
lines and keratinocytes were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected to puromycin
selection (1 mg/mL) the next day. Ninety-six hours posttransfection, puromycin-selected cells were harvested,
washed, and subjected to RNA and protein extraction.
"697" and Nalm-6 were transfected by electroporation (Gene
Pulser XCell, Bio-Rad) using commercial electroporation
buffers from Bio-Rad. Tenovin-6 (Tnv-6; DundeeCell) and
MG132 (Alexis, Biochem) were used at concentrations and
time periods indicated in the ﬁgures. Plasmids and siRNA
targeting sequences used in the study have previously been
published and are listed in Supplementary Table S4B and
S4C.
Proliferation and viability assays
Cell viability was assessed using the colorimetric MTT
metabolic activity assay. Brieﬂy, Ewing sarcoma cells (2 
104 cells per well) were cultured in 96-well plates at 37 C and
exposed to varying concentrations of Tnv-6. Solvent
(DMSO)-treated cells served as a negative control group.
Seventy two hours after treatment, 20 mL of MTT solution
(Sigma-Aldrich; 5 mg/mL in PBS) was then added and
incubated for another 3 hours. Half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values were calculated by using Spotﬁre
(TIBCO; duplicate analysis). All experiments were performed
at least 3 times in quadruplicates.
Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitations
For immunoblot analysis, total proteins were resolved
by 8.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE and processed according to
standard protocols. Antibodies in the study are listed in
Supplementary Table S4D. For monitoring antibody binding, blots were incubated for 1 hour with either horseradish
peroxidase–coupled secondary antibody for chemiluminescent detection with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, THP) or with
ﬂuorescent dye–coupled secondary antibodies (DyLight
649 and DyLight 800, Pierce Biotechnology, THP) for detection by the Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences). TP53 was precipitated with either CM1 or DO1
antibodies and probed with either acetylation-speciﬁc or
DO1 antibodies.
Reporter gene assays
For promoter activity analysis, TC252 Ewing sarcoma cells
were plated at an initial concentration of 104 cells/mL into 24well plates. Cells were transiently transfected with 50 ng of each
SIRT1-ﬁreﬂy reporter construct plus 100 ng of pSport HEY1
and pSuper empty vector, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen).
Luciferase reporter assays were then performed using Renilla
as internal control. All plasmids used are listed in Supplementary Table S4B.

Gene expression analysis
Changes in gene expression proﬁles upon knockdown of
EWS-FLI1 were followed on Affymetrix HGU133A arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.) as previously reported (3).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (QIAGEN) and quantitative analysis by TaqMan reverse
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as previously
described (3). The relative expression levels of the genes
assessed were calculated by the 2(DDCt) method.
Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays and
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections
Three different Ewing sarcoma tissue microarray (TMA)
series were used in this study: one (TMA1) previously
described (13) containing 280 samples (277 Ewing sarcoma
and three unclassiﬁed samples from Rizzoli Institute, Bologna, Italy); one (TMA2) containing 112 de-identiﬁed Ewing
sarcoma samples from the University of Michigan (Ann
Arbor, MI); and one previously described TMA from St. Jude
Children's Hospital containing primary tumor samples with
complete clinical follow-up from 43 patients (Supplementary
Table S2; ref. 14). In addition, formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from 14 paired primary
Ewing sarcoma tumor and corresponding metastasis tissues
were obtained from the University College London (see also
Supplementary Materials).
Tissue processing, antibody staining (Supplementary Table
S4C), and interpretation of staining results were performed as
previously described (13). Two pathologists blind to the origin
and identity of cases independently evaluated the percentage
and intensity of stained cells (I. Machado, A. Llombart-Bosch).
Statistical differences in staining patterns were evaluated using
the 2  2 Fisher exact (2-tailed) probability test.
Zebraﬁsh embryo xenotransplantation and in vivo Tnv-6
treatment
TG(ﬂi1:EGFP) zebraﬁsh were handled compliant to local
animal welfare regulations and maintained according to standard protocols (www.ZFIN.org). Two-day-old zebraﬁsh embryos were anaesthetized with 0.001% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich).
TC252 and A673 stably expressing mCherry were loaded as a
single-cell suspension in 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (SigmaAldrich) into 1.0 mm OD  0.78 mm ID borosilicate needles
(Harvard Apparatus). Circa 500 cells were injected into the
yolk, using a Pneumatic PicoPump (World Precision Instruments, Inc.; 10–20 psi, 100–400 ms). Larvae were maintained at
34 C. One day after implantation, six embryos were placed per
well of a 24-well plate, in a volume of 1 mL Instant Ocean
eggwater supplemented with either DMSO or Tnv-6, with daily
refreshing of the solutions. After 3 days of treatment, embryos
were ﬁxed overnight (O/N) in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 C.
Embryos were imaged in glass-bottom 96-well plates using a
NIKON3 confocal microscope (4 lens). Image processing was
performed with ImageJ 1.43 (NIH, Bethesda, MD). ImagePro
Analyzer 7.0 (Media Cybernetics) analysis was performed as
described previously (15).

Results
Identiﬁcation of candidate genes mediating HEY1
induced TP53 stabilization downstream of EWS-FLI1
We previously showed that the NOTCH effector HEY1
stabilizes and activates TP53 in Ewing sarcoma upon silencing
of EWS-FLI1, but the mechanism behind remained unknown
(3). Because TP53 stability is largely regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcations (PTM), we hypothesized that HEY1
represses a TP53 interacting protein involved in the destabilization of TP53. We considered either a repression of the
MDM2/MDM4 ubiquitin ligase complex (Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Fig. S1) or of an enzyme involved
in destabilizing posttranslational TP53 modiﬁcation.
HEY1 was ectopically expressed in TC252 cells and
genome-wide gene expression changes were compared with
the EWS-FLI1 signature previously obtained by knockdown
in ﬁve different Ewing sarcoma cell lines (TC252, WE68, STAET-1, STA-ET-7.2, SK-N-MC; ref. 4). Of 45 genes with relevance to TP53 modiﬁcation (16–18), ﬁve fulﬁlled the criterion of being signiﬁcantly suppressed in response to both
HEY1 expression in TC252 and EWS-FLI1 silencing in all ﬁve
tested Ewing sarcoma cell lines (Supplementary Table S1):
PRKDC, encoding DNA-dependent protein kinase; YEATS4,
whose product GAS41 is involved in dephosphorylation of
TP53 Ser366 (19); PPA1, stabilizing MDM4 and dephosphorylating TP53 at Ser15 (20, 21); PPP2R5C, a component of
protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylating TP53 at various
residues including Thr55, Ser37, and Ser46 (22–24), and
SIRT1, a type III deacetylase known to target histone and
non-histone proteins including TP53. While suppression of
PRKDC is expected to perturb the DNA damage checkpoint
(25), HEY1 mediated suppression of GAS41, or protein
phosphatases 1 and 2, and speciﬁcally of the deacetylase
SIRT1 has the potential to lead to TP53 stabilization and
activation. We observed a marked upregulation of SIRT1
RNA expression in 59 primary Ewing sarcoma samples as
compared with 89 normal tissues (Fig. 1A) and acetylation of
TP53 in response to EWS-FLI1 knockdown and ectopic HEY1
expression in the Ewing sarcoma cell line TC252 (Fig. 1B).
Because acetylation and deacetylation play a central role in
the regulation of the TP53 pathway (16), we therefore
focused our further analysis on SIRT1.
SIRT1 mediates TP53 stabilization by HEY1 downstream
of NOTCH and of EWS-FLI1 silencing
Ectopic HEY1 consistently reduced SIRT1 expression leading to TP53 stabilization and consequently to the induction of
CDKN1A expression in wild-type TP53 cell types, for which
NOTCH activation has been reported to act tumor suppressive.
This is demonstrated for three Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(TC252, VH64, and WE68; Fig. 1C), the B-ALL cell line 697, the
B-cell lymphoma cell line Nalm-6, and primary human keratinocytes lacking endogenous HEY1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2). SIRT1 modulation is dependent on the concentration of ectopic HEY1 as demonstrated in HEK293 cells
carrying doxycycline-inducible Flag-tagged HEY1, where it was
completely reversible upon release from doxycycline-dependent HEY1 induction (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Conversely,

SIRT1 in Tumor-Suppressive NOTCH Response

sarcoma (ES) samples as compared with 89 human tissues from the Novartis gene expression atlas. The box and whiskers plot shows the log2 expression
levels on Affymetrix arrays as described (4). The box contains data within the upper and lower quartile; the median of the data is shown as horizontal line
within the box; the whiskers extend at maximum to 1.5  IQD (interquartile distance ¼ distance between upper and lower quartile); more extreme data points
(outliers) are depicted as circles. The difference between the groups is highly signiﬁcant (P ¼ 2.2e-16, Wilcoxon test). See also Supplementary Table S1.
B, immunoblot of immunopuriﬁed TP53. TC252 cells were transfected with control empty vector, EWS-FLI1 directed shRNA (EF30), HEY1 expression plasmid,
or, for positive control, a p300 expression construct. Cells were lysed and TP53 was immunoprecipitated using anti-TP53 antibody. Equal amounts of
immunopuriﬁed TP53 were probed with pan-acetylation antibody and for control of equal TP53 loading, DO-1. C, modulation of SIRT1 and induction of TP53 and

TC252 cells were transfected with either control scrambled shRNA (Co) or EWS-FLI1 targeting shRNA EF30 in the presence of either nontargeting siRNA control
(siCo) or HEY1-speciﬁc siRNA. Because of the unavailability of sensitive HEY1-speciﬁc antibodies, HEY1 expression was monitored by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (mean values SEM of three determinations), whereas EWS-FLI1, SIRT1, and b-actin were followed on the protein level. F, HEY1 suppresses the
SIRT1 promoter by binding to an E-box element. Fireﬂy luciferase reporter assays were conducted in TC252 cells upon cotransfection of the indicated reporter

Consistent with HEY1 acting downstream of activated
NOTCH signaling, ectopic NICD1 expression also induced
SIRT1 downregulation and TP53 stabilization (Fig. 1D). To
conﬁrm dependence of EWS-FLI1–dependent SIRT1 regulation on HEY1 in Ewing sarcoma cells, we performed EWS-FLI1
knockdown in the absence and presence of siRNA to HEY1.
Silencing of EWS-FLI1 by shRNA resulted in a marked induction of HEY1 and a strong downregulation of SIRT1, which was
completely rescued upon concomitant inhibition of HEY1
expression (Fig. 1E).
HEY proteins are known to preferentially bind to class B E-box
sequences (26, 27). The SIRT1 promoter region contains a
(GACGTG) motif at 373 base pairs from the transcriptional
start site (Fig. 1F). In reporter gene assays with a 562 base
pair SIRT1 promoter fragment driving luciferase expression in
TC252 cells, HEY1 reduced the activity more than 3-fold. This
transcriptional repressive effect was completely lost upon mutation of the E-box element (Fig. 1F). Together with published
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data from HEK293
embryonal kidney cells (26), K562 myeloid leukemia, and HepG2
hepatocellular carcinoma cells (ENCODE; ref. 28) that demonstrated HEY1 binding to the SIRT1 promoter at about 300
base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, these results
conﬁrm SIRT1 as a direct HEY1 target gene.
Inhibition of SIRT1 leads to Ewing sarcoma cell death in
vitro
Modulation of SIRT1 in Ewing sarcoma cells was sufﬁcient to
induce acetylation of TP53 and activation of TP53 target genes
such as CDKN1A (Fig. 2A), as also observed upon HEY1 expression (Fig. 1C). In fact, ectopic expression of increasing amounts
of SIRT1 in the presence of HEY1 was able to abolish HEY1induced TP53 acetylation already at the lowest levels (Fig. 2B).
These results suggest that SIRT1 expression in Ewing sarcoma is
involved in functional impairment of TP53 activity, which can be
restored by activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway through
HEY1 induction upon knockdown of EWS-FLI1.

We next tested for the impact of SIRT1 modulation on cell
fate of Ewing sarcoma cells. Knockdown of SIRT1 but not of
SIRT2 induced TP53 acetylation and cell death in TC252 cells
(Fig. 3A). This result suggested that SIRT1 expression may
serve as a promising pharmacologic target in Ewing sarcoma.
We therefore tested the sensitivity of Ewing sarcoma cell lines
to the small-molecule SIRT1/2 inhibitor Tnv-6 (29). As shown
in Fig. 3B, Tnv-6 killed Ewing sarcoma cell lines with IC50 values
between 0.8 and 8.0 mmol/L. The lowest IC50 values were found
in cell lines with wild-type TP53, which also expressed the
highest levels of SIRT1, consistent with the induction of
acetylated TP53 and of CDKN1A as a marker of TP53 transcriptional activation (Fig. 3C). Dependence of Tnv-6–induced
cell death on TP53 was best demonstrated by rescue of cell
viability without any change in SIRT1 expression levels if TP53
was knocked down before Tnv-6 treatment in wild-type TP53
TC252 cells (Fig. 3D). Cell death induction by Tnv-6 was
dependent on SIRT1 but not on SIRT2, as SIRT2 knockdown
failed to rescue TC252 cell death induced by drug treatment
(Fig. 3E). Together, these results indicate that Ewing sarcoma
cells are highly sensitive to Tnv-6 treatment and that the level
of sensitivity depends on the presence or absence of intact
TP53 and SIRT1.
The SIRT1/2 inhibitor Tnv-6 inhibits Ewing sarcoma
growth and spread in a zebraﬁsh xenotransplantation
model
Because inhibition of SIRT1 was able to kill Ewing sarcoma
cell lines, we tested Tnv-6 for tumor-inhibitory activity in an
established xenotransplantation model in zebraﬁsh embryos
(30). Two cell lines with high and low SIRT1 expression and
distinct Tnv-6 in vitro sensitivity (Fig. 3B), the wild-type TP53
cell line TC252 and the TP53-mutant cell line A673, were
ﬂuorescently labeled with mCherry and injected into the yolk
sac of ﬂi1:EGFP transgenic zebraﬁsh embryos. Implanted
embryos were either treated with solvent (DMSO) or 6
mmol/L Tnv-6 for 4 days, and growth and spread of tumor

Figure 2. Modulation of SIRT1 results in TP53 acetylation. A, knockdown of SIRT1 in TC252 cells by shSIRT1 results in TP53 K382 acetylation and TP53 target
gene activation (monitored representatively by CDKN1A induction). B, ectopic expression of SIRT1 counteracts HEY1-induced TP53 acetylation. TC252 cells
were transfected with empty vector control or HEY1 expression vector plus increasing amounts of SIRT1 expression vector (left to right). TP53 was
immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal aTP53 antibody CM1, and Western blot analyses of ﬂow-through and immunoprecipitates were probed with
aSIRT1, pan-acetylation antibody, and pan-TP53 antibody DO1. Experiments indicate that in the absence of HEY1, TP53 remains deacetylated because of
the activity of endogenous SIRT1. Upon HEY1 transfection, SIRT1 is suppressed and TP53 is acetylated. Titrating-in increasing amounts of SIRT1 rescues
TP53 deacetylation in the presence of HEY1.

SIRT1 in Tumor-Suppressive NOTCH Response

Figure 3. Knockdown or
pharmacologic inhibition of SIRT1
but not of SIRT2 kills Ewing
sarcoma cells in vitro. A, silencing
of SIRT1 but not of SIRT2 in TC252
cells induces TP53 acetylation and

TC252 cell growth (right). The
number of trypan blue-excluding
cells was counted 4 days after
transfection with the indicated
constructs and is displayed relative
to control scrambled shRNA
transfection. Mean and SD for
three experiments are shown.
B, dose–response curves to Tnv-6
treatment and determination of
IC50 values for ﬁve Ewing sarcoma
cell lines with distinct SIRT1 protein
expression (inserted immunoblot)
and TP53 gene status. VH64 and
TC252 cells express wild-type
TP53, STA-ET-7.3 expresses
mutant, SK-N-MC truncated, and
A673 no TP53 due to gene deletion
(37). C, Tnv-6 induces acetylated
TP53 and CDKN1A expression in
TC252 cells but not in A673 cells.
D, the growth-inhibitory effect of
Tnv-6 depends on the presence of
wild-type TP53. TC252 cells were
transfected with control scrambled
or TP53 shRNA and treated with
8 mmol/L Tnv-6 72 hours
posttransfection. Trypan blueexcluding cells were counted after
72 hours of Tnv-6 treatment, and
mean results and SDs from one
representative of two experiments,
each performed in triplicate, are
shown relative to control
treatment. TP53 modulation by
shP53 and SIRT1 expression were
monitored by immunoblot analysis.
E, sensitivity of TC252 cells to Tnv6 is independent of SIRT2. TC252
cells transfected with either control
scrambled shRNA (pControl), or
shRNA speciﬁc for SIRT1, or
shRNA to SIRT2 were either treated
with solvent (DMSO) or 8 mmol/L
Tnv-6 for 72 hours 4 days
posttransfection. Changes in cell
numbers were determined relative
to the number of cells before start
of Tnv-6 treatment. Mean values 

experiments performed in
triplicates are shown relative to
control transfections.

quantiﬁed in Fig. 4C, Tnv-6 not only signiﬁcantly reduced tumor
burden (P < 0.0001) but also signiﬁcantly inhibited migration of
TC252 cells (P < 0.0001) but not of A673 cells. These data show
that pharmacologic inhibition of SIRT1 interferes with Ewing
sarcoma growth and migration in vivo.

SIRT1 expression in Ewing sarcoma primary tumors and
metastases
To validate SIRT1 expression in primary tumors, we
screened 392 parafﬁn-embedded, formalin-ﬁxed Ewing sarcoma samples on two series of TMAs (TMA1 and TMA2; Supplementary Fig. S4) for SIRT1 positivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cases were scored semiquantitatively, and ﬁve
groups were formed according to the percentage and intensity
of mainly nuclear stained cells. Cases were scored as noninformative (necrosis, scant material, or artifact), negative (mild
< 5%), 1þ (mild staining in 5%–10% of cells), 2þ (moderate
staining in 10%–50% of cells), or 3þ (strong staining in >50% of
cells). Two hundred ninety-eight samples gave informative
results, of which 272 samples and 26 samples were obtained
from primary tumors and metastases, respectively. For 248

TMA1 in 29 cases (Supplementary Table S2). Here, primary
tumors associated with lung metastasis and primary tumors
from patients with bone metastases tested positive in 50% and
40%, respectively.
Strikingly, this tendency turned into a signiﬁcant difference
(P < 0.001) when focusing on 26 informative metastasis-derived
samples (Fig. 5B, last column). Here, two thirds of metastases
showed SIRT1 expression in more than 10% of cells (8 moderately positive, 9 highly positive), whereas four samples tested
negative and ﬁve metastases showed SIRT1 positivity in less
than 10% of cells (Fig. 5B).
To validate our ﬁnding of increased SIRT1 positivity in
Ewing sarcoma metastases, we tested an independent series
of 14 paired tissue samples for SIRT1 expression by IHC
(Table 1, cases 1–14). Including 4 paired samples available
from TMA1 and TMA2 (Table 1, cases 15–18), we found lung
metastases to score positive in 88% and bone marrow
metastases in 55% of cases similar to the frequency in

the primary tumors of these metastatic patients (61%), a
frequency twice as high as observed on the TMAs for
the primary tumors of patients with localized disease.
These results suggest that Ewing sarcoma metastases, speciﬁcally lung metastases are predominantly highly positive
for SIRT1 by IHC, and that this positivity can frequently
already be observed in the corresponding primary tumors at
diagnosis.
Because this ﬁnding may imply a prognostic relevance of
SIRT1 positivity, we independently tested a third previously
published cohort of 43 patients with Ewing sarcoma with
complete clinical follow-up for a median of 154 months for
SIRT1 expression by IHC (TMA3; Supplementary Fig. S4;
ref. 14). Six of 32 localized tumors (19%) and 6 of 11 tumors
from patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis (55%) tested
highly or moderately SIRT1 positive. Intriguingly, 5-year survival probability for the 12 SIRT1-positive patients was 25% as
compared with 70% for the 31 SIRT1-negative patients

Although these results call for larger prospective studies to
validate the potential prognostic importance of SIRT1 in Ewing
sarcoma, our combined data strongly imply SIRT1 as a candidate therapeutic target in patients with Ewing sarcoma with
metastatic disease.

Discussion
The NOTCH signaling pathway is well known for its complexity. Its role in cancer has been extensively studied in the
context of oncogenic NOTCH mutations but little was known
about its tumor-suppressive mechanisms. We here report on
the mechanism by which HEY1 downstream of activated
NOTCH induces TP53 and demonstrate that this mechanism
is operative not only in Ewing sarcoma but also in other
malignancies and tissues for which NOTCH activity has been
linked to tumor suppression. We ﬁnd that HEY1 consistently
suppresses SIRT1 in Ewing sarcoma, B-ALL, and B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary human keratinocytes, leading to
TP53 acetylation, stabilization, and transcriptional activation.
SIRT1 has previously been described to be involved in the
epigenetic transcriptional repression of the HEY1 promoter. In
the absence of NOTCH activation, SIRT1 forms a corepressor
complex with LSD1, CoREST1, and CtBP1, leading to concerted
repressive histone H4K16 deacetylation and H3K4 demethylation at the HEY1 promoter. Because we ﬁnd SIRT1 (shown

6586

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

here) and also LSD1 (31) to be consistently expressed in Ewing
sarcoma, and concomitantly HEY1 to be completely turned off
(5), this mechanism is likely operative in Ewing sarcoma. Upon
activation and nuclear translocation of NICD and binding to
the NOTCH regulated transcription factor CSL, this corepressor complex is replaced by mastermind-like (MAML) and coactivators, including the histone lysine acetyltransferase p300/
CBP, leading to transcriptional activation (9). In addition,
NICD stability has been reported to be prolonged by acetylation, which is modulated by SIRT1, with negative consequences
on duration and amplitude of the NOTCH response (1). Also,
SIRT1 represses NOTCH1 transcription from a highly conserved region in the NOTCH1 promoter in endothelial cells
(32). By demonstrating suppression of SIRT1 expression by
HEY1, our results add an important negative feedback loop to
NOTCH-driven gene regulation (Fig. 6). It also adds a putative
feedback mechanism of potential prognostic value to the
regulation of TP53. Not only does SIRT1 modulate TP53
stability and activity but also TP53 has been demonstrated to
suppress SIRT1 expression through transcriptional repression
via binding to a TP53 response element in the SIRT1 promoter
(33) and posttranscriptional regulation via TP53-activated
microRNA hsa-mir-34a (Fig. 6; ref. 34). Interestingly, hsamir-34a and two other SIRT1 regulatory microRNAs, hsamir-132 and hsa-mir-93, were recently described components
of a favorable prognostic signature in Ewing sarcoma (35).
Because we ﬁnd SIRT1 positivity in Ewing sarcoma mainly
associated with metastases, it is intriguing to speculate that the
TP53/hsa-mir-34a/SIRT1 gene regulatory module plays a role
in the suppression of metastases. In fact, our results in a
zebraﬁsh xenotransplantation model demonstrated that inhibition of SIRT1 prohibits Ewing sarcoma cell dissemination.
Because the yolk sac, the site of tumor cell injection, is only
poorly vascularized (as is visible from the absence of ﬂi:EGFP–
positive endothelial cells in Fig. 4), and tumor cells in controltreated animals migrated not only to the tail but also to the
head region of the embryos, Tnv-6 likely inhibited active tumor
cell migration, consistent with the documented role of SIRT1 in
the regulation of cortactin (36). This migration inhibitory
effect could not be studied in vitro because of the strong
cytotoxic effect of Tnv-6 and of SIRT1 knockdown observed in
the Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Cell death induction upon
perturbation of SIRT1 expression or activity was mainly due
to activation of TP53 and could be rescued upon knockdown
of TP53. In fact, sensitivity to pharmacologic SIRT1 inhibition
was highest in wild-type TP53 cell lines, which are representative of more than 90% of Ewing sarcoma (37). However, also
mutant TP53 cell lines proved sensitive to Tnv-6 treatment,
albeit at much higher doses, which is likely due to the broad
transcriptional and epigenetic roles of SIRT1 in genome-wide
gene regulation as has previously been observed (29).
Although it cannot be excluded that part of the in vitro
cytotoxic activity of Tnv-6 may be due to a non-SIRT1/
non-TP53–related activity such as induction of autophagy
as previously observed in CLL (38), it did not play a role in the
zebraﬁsh xenotransplantation model. Here, drug activity was
dependent on high SIRT1 expression and the presence of
wild-type TP53.

SIRT1 in Tumor-Suppressive NOTCH Response

of bone tumor specimens might have led to false negativity
in some cases. Intriguingly, outcome results of the small
retrospective St. Jude cohort suggested that not only metastatic patients but also patients with localized but SIRT1positive tumors had an adverse prognosis. These results
need to be conﬁrmed on larger, prospectively collected
sample series.
While there is already evidence that Sirtuin activators are
clinically well tolerated, early clinical trials with SIRT1 inhibitors have only recently been initiated. Metastases are the main
cause of treatment failure and death in cancer. Our ﬁndings of
high SIRT1 positivity in metastases of patients with Ewing
sarcoma and sensitivity of SIRT1-positive tumor cell lines to
SIRT1 inhibition in vitro and in vivo may therefore open an
exciting new avenue to cancer treatment.

Figure 6. Model of the NOTCH/TP53 feedback regulatory loop and its
regulation by EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma. 1, binding of the NOTCH
ligand JAG1 to a NOTCH receptor results in 2 (proteolytic cleavage of
NICD, which activates HEY1). 3, we show that HEY1 transcriptionally
þ
represses SIRT1. 4, SIRT1 suppresses TP53 activation by NAD
dependent deacetylation. 5, TP53, when active, suppresses SIRT1 by
direct binding to its promoter (33) and indirectly, by 6 (activating SIRT1
targeting microRNAs including miR-34a; ref. 40). 7, SIRT1 also modulates
NOTCH activation by deacetylation of NICD (1) and by 8 (transcriptional
regulation; ref. 32). 9, SIRT1 feeds back on its negative regulator HEY1 by
epigenetically silencing its promoter (9). While NOTCH activation via
HEY1 is able to suppress SIRT1, several additional mechanisms are
known to activate or repress SIRT1, including transcriptional regulators
HIF1 and 2 and HIC1 (39, 41), microRNAs (40), kinases (42–47), and
sumoylation (48) that integrate microenvironmental signals with SIRT1
expression/activity and may be responsible for the speciﬁc upregulation
of SIRT1 observed in ES lung metastases in 10. 11, EWS-FLI1 directly
binds to the SIRT1 promoter (49) and modulates SIRT1 regulatory
microRNAs (no. 12; ref. 50), whereas 13 suppresses cell autonomous
NOTCH activation by transcriptional repression of JAG1.

Our IHC study performed on a total of four independent
ES cohorts reproducibly indicated increased SIRT1 expression in metastases, speciﬁcally in lung metastases. However,
results for the frequency of SIRT1-positive staining in the
primary tumors of patients presenting with metastases
differed between the series. The UCL and the St. Jude cohorts
implied high SIRT1 in metastatic patients, whereas in the
Rizzoli and the Michigan cohorts, the frequency of SIRT1positive primary tumors in localized and metastatic disease
were comparable, still with a tendency toward higher numbers of positively staining tumor cells in metastatic cases. It
is possible that tumor cell heterogeneity and focal SIRT1
expression might have led to an underestimation of SIRT1positive cases in the primary tumors of metastatic patients
on these TMAs. Also, we cannot exclude that decalciﬁcation
