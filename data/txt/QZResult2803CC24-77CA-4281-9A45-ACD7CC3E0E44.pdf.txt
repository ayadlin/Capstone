A Century of Deciphering the Control Mechanisms of Sex Steroid
Action in Breast and Prostate Cancer: The Origins of Targeted
Therapy and Chemoprevention

Abstract
The origins of the story to decipher the mechanisms that
control the growth of sex hormone–dependent cancers started
more than 100 years ago. Clinical observations of the
apparently random responsiveness of breast cancer to
endocrine ablation (hormonal withdrawal) provoked scientific inquiries in the laboratory that resulted in the development
of effective strategies for targeting therapy to the estrogen
receptor (ER; or androgen receptor in the case of prostate
cancer), the development of antihormonal treatments that
dramatically enhanced patient survival, and the first successful testing of agents to reduce the risk of developing any
cancer. Most importantly, elucidating the receptor-mediated
mechanisms of sex steroid–dependent growth and the clinical
success of antihormones has had broad implication in
medicinal chemistry with the synthesis of new selective
hormone receptor modulators for numerous clinical applications. Indeed, the successful translational research on the ER
was the catalyst for the current strategy for developing
targeted therapies to the tumor and the start of ‘‘individualized medicine.’’ During the past 50 years, ideas about the value
of antihormones translated effectively from the laboratory to
improve clinical care, improve national survival rates, and
significantly reduced the burden of cancer. [Cancer Res

Beginnings at the Dawn of the 20th Century
Schinzinger (1) is credited with suggesting that oophorectomy
could be used to treat breast cancer; however, this suggestion did
not seem to have been adopted. In contrast, the report by Beaston
(2) that oophorectomy could initiate a regression of metastatic
breast cancer in two premenopausal women was a landmark
achievement. Although it is often stated that Beaston’s work was
empirical clinical research, the rationale to conduct an oophorectomy was, in fact, an example of early translational research.
Beaston was aware of the essential role of removing the ovary in
maximizing milk production in cows. He reasoned there was
potentially some factor that traveled in the blood supply to the
breast as there was no known connection through the nerves.
Interestingly enough, he also conducted laboratory experiments in
rabbits before his clinical experiment, so the work was bench-tobedside (2). By 1900, Stanley Boyd (3) had assembled the results of

all the available clinical cases of oophorectomy to treat breast
cancer in Great Britain in perhaps the first ‘‘clinical trial.’’ Boyd
concluded that only one-third of metastatic breast tumors
responded to oophorectomy. This clinical result and overall
response rate has remained the same to this day.
Unfortunately, responses were of limited duration and enthusiasm waned that this approach was the answer to cancer treatment.
The approach of endocrine ablation was only relevant to breast
cancer (and subsequently prostate cancer; ref. 4), thus, the
approach was only effective in a small subset of all cancer types.
At the dawn of the 20th Century, there was no understanding of the
endocrine system or hormones. Nevertheless, laboratory studies
started to decipher the biological control mechanisms responsible
for the clinical observations.

Links between Sex Steroids and Cancer
The trend in breast cancer research in the early years of the 20th
century was to use inbred strains of mice to study the growth and
incidence of spontaneous mammary cancer. Lathrop and Loeb (5)
found that before age 3 months was the optimal time for
oophorectomy to prevent the development of mammary cancer,
but obviously, this knowledge could not be translated to the clinical
setting; who would one treat? The mechanism was also unknown
until Allen and Doisy (6), using an ovariectomized mouse vaginal
cornification assay, showed that a principle, that they called
estrogen (identified as estrone, the principal steroid), was present
in ovarian follicular fluid. Their major advance set the scene for the
subsequent breakthroughs in molecular endocrinology and therapeutics in the latter half of the 20th century (Fig. 1).
The idea that breast cancer might be a preventable disease was
extended by Professor Antoine Lacassagne (7, 8) who first showed
that estrogen could induce mammary tumors in mice. Lacassagne
(9) hypothesized, ‘‘If one accepts the consideration of adenocarcinoma of the breast as the consequence of a special hereditary sensibility
to the proliferative action of oestrone, one is led to imagine a
therapeutic preventive for subjects predisposed by their heredity to
this cancer. It would consist—perhaps in the very near future when
the knowledge and use of hormones will be better understood—in the
suitable use of a hormone, antagonistic or excretory, to prevent the
stagnation of oestrone in the ducts of the breasts.’’ However, when
Lacassagne stated his vision at the annual meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research in Boston in 1936, there were no
lead compounds that antagonized estrogen action, but the Allen
Doisy mouse assay could be used to study structure activity
relationships to find synthetic estrogens. Within a decade, a
landmark discovery was to occur in ‘‘chemical therapy’’ that was to
expand the treatment of metastatic breast cancer to include
postmenopausal women who are, in fact, the majority who develop
metastatic disease.

Figure 1. Timeline of the major landmarks in estrogen action and its application for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.

During the 1930s, there were significant advances in the
knowledge of the precise structural requirements for estrogen
action in its target tissue, the vagina. Synthetic compounds based
on stilbene (10, 11) and triphenylethylene (12) were screened using
the Allen Doisy ovariectomized mouse vaginal cornification assay
to define compounds with optimal structures and duration of
estrogen action. Sir Alexander Haddow found that carcinogenic
polycyclic hydrocarbons would cause tumor regression in animals.
However, these could not be used to treat humans. The
nonsteroidal triphenylethylene-based estrogens had similar structures to polycyclic hydrocarbons and also caused tumor regression
in animals. With this clue, Sir Alexander Haddow (13) used the first
chemical therapy to treat patients. His results published in 1944
showed that high-dose estrogen therapy was effective in causing
tumor regressions in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer
and men with prostate cancer. There was, however, no understanding of a mechanism. Indeed he stated in 1970: ‘‘In spite of the
extremely limited practicability of such measure [high dose estrogen],
the extraordinary extent of tumor regression observed in perhaps 1%
of postmenopausal cases has always been regarded as of major
theoretical importance, and it is a matter for some disappointment
that so much of the underlying mechanisms continues to elude us’’
(14). These experimental data were also an apparent paradox as
endocrine ablation to remove estrogens and their precursors was
the dogma of the time (15).
In the past 50 years, the progress in deciphering the control
mechanisms of estrogen action in breast cancer (and androgen
action in prostate cancer), has accelerated with advances in
technology and an understanding of cell biology. But progress in
research does not travel in straight lines, yet chance observations
can create a major breakthrough. This has happened repeatedly in
the story of the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.

Conceptual Progress through Scientific Serendipity
It is perhaps relevant to illustrate a few astute observations by
scientists that accelerated progress immensely in deciphering the
complexities of hormone action and the control of breast cancer
growth.
Sir Charles Dodds (11) is credited with the synthesis of the
potent synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (Fig. 2) that was
subsequently used for the treatment of both prostate cancer and
breast cancer, and regrettably was also applied to prevent recurrent
abortions (16), which caused an increase in clear cell carcinoma of
the vagina in the children (17). During the race to describe the
minimal molecular structure that would trigger vaginal cornification in the ovariectomized mouse vagina, controversy erupted in
the 1930s over the reproducibility of results concerning the
compound anethole. The authors were minimalistic in reporting
the synthetic methodology, so replication proved impossible to
create the correct biology. Rather the product was correct, but the
method used by the original authors was not reported accurately
and caused dimerization of anethole to an impurity dianethole an
estrogen. This active impurity was structurally similar to parallel
research endeavors that concluded with the synthesis of the potent
estrogen diethylstilbestrol. Thus, the purity of chemicals for testing
was critical for successful science.
A similar story was also immensely important in allowing
scientists to understand the direct actions of estrogen on the breast
cancer cell in vitro. The MCF-7 estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
breast cancer cell line (18) has been the work horse for the study of
estrogen-stimulated growth. However, early examination of MCF-7
cells in the 1970s could not uniformly show estrogen-stimulated
growth. Antiestrogens inhibited the apparently constitutive growth
of MCF-7 cells, but estradiol did reverse the inhibitory actions of

antiestrogens on growth (19). The mystery deepened when studies
in vitro could not show estrogen-stimulated growth but MCF-7
cells inoculated into athymic mice would grow into tumors only
with estrogen treatment. There was clearly a second factor
required for estrogen-stimulated tumor growth in vivo! (20).
The astute observations of John and Benita Katzenellenbogen
solved the mystery of why estrogen did not stimulate MCF-7 breast
cancer cell growth in vitro. It seems that all cells had been grown

for more than a decade in standard medium containing large
concentrations of a pH indicator called phenol red. The
Katzenellenbogens realized that the structure of phenol red was
similar to nonsteroidal estrogens and removal of the indicator from
cell culture media caused cell growth rate to decrease and only
then would exogenous estrogen cause growth (21). In other words,
the cells were already growing maximally in phenol red containing
medium. Subsequent studies revealed that the culprit was, in fact,

a partially dimerized chemical contaminant of phenol red. This
critical technical advance permitted all of the subsequent
understanding of the molecular biology of direct estrogen action.
Leonard Lerner (22) was a young research endocrinologist
employed by Merrell Dowe to study nonsteroidal estrogen
pharmacology. He noticed that the structure of one of the
compounds being tested for the control of coronary artery disease
was a triphenylethanol similar to the estrogenic triphenylethylenes
and he asked to test this chemical as an estrogen. To his surprise,
the compound, subsequently renamed MER25 or ethamoxytriphetol, was antiestrogenic in all species tested and had no
estrogen-like actions in any animal tests. Lerner (22) had
discovered the first nonsteroidal antiestrogen. Although the
compound was too toxic and not potent enough for clinical use,
Lerner went on to be involved in the discovery of the first
triphenylethylene antiestrogen called chloramiphene (MRL41) later
to be known as clomiphene (23). Originally, the nonsteroidal
antiestrogens were predicted, based on animal studies, to be potent
postcoital contraceptives, which in the early 1960s had a huge
potential market as ‘‘morning after pills.’’ However, clomiphene did
exactly the opposite; it induced ovulation in women (23).
Enthusiasm waned and there was general disinterest in this area
of research until ICI 46,474, another nonsteroidal antiestrogen
discovered in the fertility program of ICI Pharmaceutical Ltd (now

AstraZeneca; ref. 24) was reinvented as the first targeted therapy
for breast cancer and the first chemopreventive for any cancer (25).

A Target for Treatment and Prevention
The early theory for estrogen action in its target tissues, e.g.,
uterus, vagina, etc., was that there was chemical transformation
between estrone and the less abundant 17h estradiol (Fig. 2) to
control the redox potential of the tissue environment. In the late
1950s, Jensen (Fig. 3) and Jacobsen (26) chose another approach at
the Ben May Laboratories of the University of Chicago. They
synthesized (6, 7) [3H] estradiol (Fig. 2) with very high-specific
activity. After its injection into the immature female rats, the
unchanged steroid bound to and was retained by the estrogen
target tissues: the uterus, vagina, and pituitary gland. In contrast,
[3H] estradiol bound to, but was not retained, by nontarget tissues,
e.g., muscle, lung, heart. There was clearly a receptor mechanism at
play that could be blocked (27) by the coadministration of the first
nonsteroidal antiestrogen MER-25 (22).
The mystery of why only about one third of advanced breast
cancers responded to either endocrine ablation (3) or high-dose
estrogen therapy (15) was solved by the application of basic
endocrinology to the practical issue of excluding women with
metastatic breast cancer who would not significantly benefit from

their work on androgen action in cancer and the role of ER in physiology and cancer, respectively.

unnecessary endocrine ablative surgery (oophorectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy). The ER was found to be an extractable
protein from the rat uterus that would bind [3H] estradiol in the
extraction cytosol (28, 29). During the late 1960s, numerous
methods were described to identify and quantitative ER levels in
tumor biopsies (30) and these data were subsequently correlated
with clinical outcomes in metastatic breast cancer (30). Breast
tumors without the ER were unlikely to respond to endocrine
ablation and therefore should not be treated with this modality.
The ER assay was introduced as the standard of care in the mid1970s to predict endocrine responsiveness to endocrine ablation. It
should be stressed that tamoxifen was not available in medical
practice until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
this ‘‘hormone therapy’’ in December 1977 for the treatment of
metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women (23). Indeed,
research with the value of the ER assay to predict responsiveness to
antiestrogens was unconvincing (23) and the value of adding
another hormone therapy to the treatment armamentarium was
uncertain. In the 1970s, all hopes in medical oncology were focused
on discovering the correct combination of high dose cytotoxic
therapies to cure breast cancer much in the same way as both
childhood leukemias and Hodgkin’s Disease had been cured. This
was not to be but translational research took another route; using
the ER as a drug target instead of as a predictive test for endocrine
ablation (31).

An Unlikely Therapeutic Solution
Professor Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) established a model for the
development of chemical therapies (chemotherapy) to treat
infectious disease. A range of chemical therapies would be
synthesized to study structure function relationships in appropriate laboratory models that replicated human disease (32). A clinical
study would then be performed on the most promising candidate.
Ehrlich’s pioneering work to develop Salvarsan for the successful
treatment of syphilis is a landmark achievement (32). He was,
however, unsuccessful in applying the same principles to cancer
chemotherapy. Indeed, even as recently as 1970, Sir Alexander
Haddow (14) stated that there was unlikely to be a ‘‘chemotherapia
specifica’’ like Paul Ehrlich envisioned because cancer was so
similar to the tissue of origin. There was also no target or effective
tests or models to predict efficacy in cancer treatment before
administration to the patient. The key to the successful
development of tamoxifen, a failed contraceptive (23), was the
application of Ehrlich’s principles of developing an effective
treatment strategy by using disease specific laboratory models
and the use of the tumor ER as a target for drug action (25).
Available laboratory models for the study of the antitumor
actions of antiestrogenic drugs were strains of mice with a high
incidence of spontaneous mammary tumors (5) or the carcinogeninduced rat mammary carcinoma (33). The mouse models had
fallen out of fashion with the discovery of the ‘‘Bittner milk factor,’’ a
virus that transmits mammary carcinogenesis to subsequent
generations through the mother’s milk (34). The research
community also began to realize that breast cancer was not a
viral disease. Nevertheless, the knowledge of mouse mammary
carcinogenesis proved to be pivotal for developing precise and
targeted promoters to initiate mammary cancer with oncogenes
using transgenic mice (35). Another problem with tumor testing of
tamoxifen in mice was the unusual observation that tamoxifen, or
ICI 46,474 as it was then known, was an estrogen in the mouse

www.aacrjournals.org

(24, 36). This pharmacologic peculiarity became important later
with the recognition of selective ER modulation (37). Most
importantly, work did not advance quickly in the 1960s and early
1970s, as there was no enthusiasm about introducing a new
‘‘hormonal therapy’’ into clinical practice (25). All early compounds
had failed to advance past early clinical studies and only tamoxifen
was marketed (23) for the induction of ovulation or the general
treatment of late-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women
(38–40).
In the late 1960s, the 7,12-dimethybenz(a)anthracene–induced
(DMBA) rat mammary carcinoma model (33) was extremely
fashionable for research on the endocrinology of rat mammary
carcinogenesis (41, 42). However, the parallels with breast cancer
are few, as the tumors do not metastasize and are regulated
primarily by prolactin secreted by the pituitary gland in direct
response to estrogen action (43). Be that as it may, there was no
alternative. Therefore, the DMBA rat mammary carcinoma model
was adapted to determine the appropriate strategy for the use of
antihormonal therapy as an adjuvant. At that time in the mid1970s, the early adjuvant trials with tamoxifen did not target
patients with ER-positive breast cancer and used only short-term
(1 year) tamoxifen treatment to avoid premature drug resistance. This
duration of tamoxifen that was selected as the antiestrogen only
controlled the growth of metastatic breast cancer for about a year
(39). The value of short- and long-term (1- or 6-month treatment
equivalent to 1 or 6 years of adjuvant treatment in patients)
antihormone administration was determined starting treatment
1 month after DMBA administration to 60-day-old Sprague-Dawley
rats. Long-term therapy was remarkably effective at controlling the
appearance of mammary tumors and was far superior to short
term treatment (44, 45). The concepts of targeting the ER and using
long-term adjuvant therapy effectively translated through clinical
trials to improve national survival rates for breast cancer (46, 47).

Targeting Treatment for Breast Cancer
The early clinical work of Santen (48) established the practical
feasibility of using aminogluthemide, an agent that blocks both
adrenal steroidogenesis and the CYP19 aromatase enzyme to stop
conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and
estrone, respectively. Unfortunately, aminoglutethimide must be
given with a natural glucocorticoid; therefore, long-term therapy is
not a practical possibility. Brodie and coworkers (49, 50) advanced
knowledge of the specific targeting of the CYP19 aromatase
enzyme with the identification and subsequent development of 4
hydroxyandrostenedione (51) as the first practical suicide inhibitor
of the aromatase enzyme (Fig. 4). Incidentally, the pivotal work
with both tamoxifen and 4-hydroxyandrostenedione (Figs. 2 and 4)
was initiated at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental
Biology in Massachusetts in the early 1970s (52). Brodie’s
contribution eventually became the catalyst to create a whole
range of agents (e.g., anastrozole; Fig. 3) targeted to the aromatase
enzyme for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal
women (53). The clinical application of aromatase inhibitors has
reduced the side effects noted with tamoxifen in postmenopausal
women such as blood clots and endometrial cancer and there has
been a small but significant improvement in disease control for the
postmenopausal patient when results are compared with tamoxifen
(54, 55).
However, recent research into the pharmacogenetics of tamoxifen has suggested that CYP2D6 enzyme product is important for

metabolism to the active antiestrogen endoxifene (4-hydroxy-Ndesmethyltamoxifen; ref. 56), and the use of certain selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors to reduce hot flashes seems to be
contraindicated because of drug interaction at the CYP2D6 enzyme
(57, 58). Current research is also exploring the hypothesis that a
mutated and ineffective CYP2D6 gene product undermines the
therapeutic activity of tamoxifen (57, 58). It may be that patients
could eventually be selected for optimal effective tamoxifen
treatment in cases of ER-positive breast cancer. This would be
worthwhile for the chemoprevention of breast cancer. Clearly, the
identification of patients for optimal long-term use of tamoxifen
should exclude those high-risk women with a mutant CYP2D6 gene
who choose to use chemoprevention, as tamoxifen treatment may
possibly be suboptimal.

Chemoprevention of Breast Cancer
In the middle of the 1970s, Sporn (59) advanced the concept
of the chemoprevention of cancer and strongly advocated this
approach as the optimal and clearly most rational way to reduce
the burden of cancer. Practical chemoprevention articulated by
Lacassagne (9) has its foundations with the finding that
tamoxifen prevents DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis
(60, 61). These laboratory findings (45, 60, 61) and the
subsequent clinical finding that adjuvant tamoxifen treatment
reduces the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (62)
prompted Powles (63, 64) to initiate the first exploratory trial
to test the worth of tamoxifen to reduce the incidence of breast
cancer in high risk women. Although numbers were small, the
Powles study did ultimately show the ability of tamoxifen to
reduce breast cancer incidence many years after the treatment
had stopped (65). In contrast, the large study by Fisher (66, 67)
definitively showed the efficacy of tamoxifen to reduce the
incidence of ER-positive breast cancer initially and continues to
do so after therapy stops in both premenopausal and
postmenopausal women at high risk. Tamoxifen became the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

first medicine approved by the FDA for risk reduction of any
cancer. However, concerns based on laboratory findings (68),
about the potential of tamoxifen to increase the risk of
endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women and the carcinogenic potential of tamoxifen as a hepatocarcinogen (69),
demanded that there had to be a better way to reduce the
risk of breast cancer as a public health initiative.
The recognition of selective estrogen receptor modulator
(SERM) action by nonsteroidal antiestrogens that stimulate some
estrogen target tissues but block estrogen-stimulated tumor growth
in others, (70) introduced a new dimension into therapeutics and
advanced chemoprevention. Raloxifene has its origins as a
nonsteroidal antiestrogen for the treatment of breast cancer
(71, 72) as LY156758 or keoxifene. The drug failed in that indication
(73) and further development was abandoned (74). The discovery
that both tamoxifen and keoxifene would maintain bone density in
ovariectomized rats (75), block rat mammary carcinogenesis (76),
but that keoxifene was less estrogen-like than tamoxifen in the
rodent uterus (71) and was less effective in stimulating the growth
of endometrial cancer, (77) suggested a new therapeutic strategy
(78). Simply stated (79): ‘‘We have obtained valuable clinical
information about this group of drugs that can be applied in other
disease states. Research does not travel in straight lines and
observations in one field of science often become major discoveries
in another. Important clues have been garnered about the effects of
tamoxifen on bone and lipids, so it is possible that derivatives could
find targeted applications to retard osteoporosis or atherosclerosis.
The ubiquitous application of novel compounds to prevent diseases
associated with the progressive changes after menopause may, as a
side effect, significantly retard the development of breast cancer. The
target population would be postmenopausal women in general,
thereby avoiding the requirement to select a high-risk group to
prevent breast cancer.’’
Several years later, keoxifene was renamed raloxifene (Fig. 2) and
was shown to maintain bone density in osteoporotic or osteopenic
women (80), and simultaneously reduce the incidence of invasive

breast cancer without causing an increase in the incidence of
endometrial cancer (81). Raloxifene went on to be tested against
tamoxifen in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene trial (82) and
was FDA approved both for the treatment and prevention of
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for the reduction of
invasive breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women at
elevated risk. The clinical advances with SERMs-modulating
estrogen target tissues has provided exceptional opportunities to
treat and prevent multiple diseases. However, for the future it is the
study of the molecular events of estrogen action that holds the
promise of further breakthroughs in patient care.

Molecular Mechanisms of Estrogen and
SERM Action
It is not possible to provide a comprehensive review of the
explosion of interest in receptor-mediated molecular mechanisms
of action of estrogen, so the reader is referred to significant reviews
to appreciate the evolution of the topic (83, 84). What will be
presented is an evolving guide to current thinking. There are two
ERs called a and h (Figs. 5 and 6). The receptor ERa is the
traditional ER (26, 28), but it should be stressed that the
development of monoclonal antibodies to ER (85) was the essential
step for ERa cloning (86, 87) that provided the clues to discover
ERh (88). The receptor proteins encode on different chromosomes
and have homology as members of the steroid receptor
superfamily, but there are distinct patterns of distribution and
distinct and subtle differences in structure and ligand binding
affinity. An additional dimension that may be significant for tissue
modulation is the ratio of ERa and ERh at a target site. A high
ERa/ERh ratio correlates well with very high levels of cellular
proliferation, whereas the predominance of functional ERh over
ERa correlates with low levels of proliferation (89, 90). The ratio of
ERs in normal and neoplasic breast tissue may be an important
factor for the long-term success of chemoprevention with SERMs.

There is, as a result, much interest in synthesizing ER subtype
specific ligands.
There are functional differences between ERa and ERh that can
be traced to the differences in the Activating Function 1 (AF-1)
domain located in the amino terminus of the ER (Fig. 6). The
amino acid homology of AF-1 is poorly conserved (only 20%). In
contrast, AF-2 region located at the C terminus of the ligand
binding domain, differs only by one amino acid: D545 in ERa and
N496 in ERh. Because the AF-1 and AF-2 regions are critical for the
interaction with other coregulatory proteins and gene transcription, the structural differences between AF-1 provides a clue about
the potential functional differences between ER a and h. Studies
using chimeras of ER a and h by switching the AF-1 regions show
that this region contributes to the cell and promoter specific
differences in transcriptional activity. In general, SERMs can
partially activate engineered genes regulated by an estrogen
response element through ERa but not ERh (91, 92). In contrast,
4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene can stimulate activating
protein-1–regulated reporter genes with both ERa and ERh in a
cell-dependent fashion.
The simple model for estrogen action, with either ERa or ERh
controlling estrogen-regulated events, has now evolved into a
fascinating mix of protein partners that have the potential to
modulate gene transcription (Fig. 5). It is more than a decade since
the first steroid receptor coactivator was first described (93). Now
dozens of coactivator molecules are known, and also corepressor
molecules exist to prevent the gene transcription by unliganded
receptors (94).
It is reasonable to ask how does the ligand program the receptor
complex to interact with other proteins? X-ray crystallography of
the ligand binding domains of the ER liganded with either
estrogens or antiestrogens show the potential of ligands to
promote coactivator binding or prevent coactivator binding based
on the shape of the estrogen or anti-ER complex (95, 96). Evidence
has accumulated that the broad spectrum of ligands that bind to

estrogens, antiestrogens, and SERMs in

receptor complex (NRC ) that results from
ligand binding to either ERa or ERh can

corepressors (CoR ) to initiate estrogenic or
antiestrogenic responses, respectively. The
activation of transcription at a promoter site
of an estrogen responsive gene occurs
through the binding of the complex that
is cyclically destroyed through the
proteosome and then the reassembling of
a new complex.

the ER can create a broad range of ER complexes that are either
fully estrogenic or antiestrogenic at a particular target site (97).
Thus, a mechanistic model of estrogen action and antiestrogen
action (Fig. 5) has emerged based on the shape of the ligand that
programs the complex to adopt a particular shape that ultimately
interacts with coactivators or corepressors in target cells to
determine the estrogenic or antiestrogenic response, respectively.
Not surprisingly, the coactivator model of steroid hormone
action has now become enhanced into multiple layers of
complexity thereby amplifying the molecular mechanisms of
modulation (98).The ER complex with its core coactivator
(e.g., SRC3) positions itself in the promoter region of an ER
responsive gene and attracts associated molecules that engages
RNApolII to start transcription. However, the complex of associated
molecules also acetylates or deacetylates histones on DNA, thereby
regulating the exposure of DNA to modulate transcription.
Additionally, associated molecules are recruited to the receptor
complex that are members of a family of enzymes that
ubiquitinylate proteins in the complex for destruction. Estrogen
action is therefore a dynamic process of complex assembly and
destruction at the target gene (99).
The complicated modulation of estrogen action at individual
target sites is challenging to comprehend but provides opportunities to develop new targeted treatments for sex steroids.

Current Insights into Sex Steroid Modulation
The accumulated knowledge about modulating the ER complex
through coregulators interacting at AF-2 and AF-1 create new
opportunities for novel drug discovery. The target site modulation
of the ER with SERMs has been expanded to the androgen receptor
(AR) with selective AR modulators (SARM; refs. 100, 101). existing
nonsteroidal SARMs are being used to define tissue specific gene
expression that will lead to clinically useful selective anabolic
therapies without stimulating the prostate (102).
Studies of the molecular pharmacology of selective nuclear
receptor modulators are focused on the relationship between the
external shape of the ligand receptor complex and coregulator
binding at AF-2 (103, 104). Combinatorial phage display can
identify external regions of the receptor complex to map SARM
action or create peptide antagonists that will block coactivator
binding with potential as new therapies for prostate cancer.
Indeed, this approach is now being extended to orphan nuclear
receptors that do not need a small ligand for gene regulation (105).
Progress with defining cofactors to study the biology of estrogenrelated receptor a (ERR-a) is an important advance with
significance for new targeted therapeutic agents. The recent
description of the role of ERR-a in angiogenesis of ER-negative
tumors (106) is a potential practical application of this work.

Hormone-Dependent Cancer

Posttranslational modifications of sex steroid receptors at
AF-1 through phosphorylation cascades have their origins from
the cell surface growth factor receptors (107, 108) This knowledge
has a potential application to understand the molecular biology
of antihormone resistance. However, our evolving knowledge
of antihormonal drug resistance has important therapeutic
consequences.

Drug Resistance to SERMs
The acceptance of the concept of long-term antihormonal
therapy to target, treat, and prevent breast cancer (25) raised the
specter of drug resistance to SERMs and SARMs. However, the early
models of SERM resistance did not reflect the majority of clinical
experience. The natural laboratory models of antihormone
resistance caused stimulation of tumor growth during a year of
therapy (109), and therefore, reflected drug resistance in patients
with metastatic breast cancer who are only treated successfully for
a year. The early laboratory models of drug resistance did not
replicate clinical experience with adjuvant therapy for 5 years.
Remarkably, drug resistance evolves (Fig. 7) and the survival
signaling pathways in tamoxifen-resistant tumors becomes reorganized so that instead of estrogen being a survival signal,
physiologic estrogen now inhibits tumor growth (110). This
discovery provides an invaluable insight into the evolution of drug
resistance to SERMS and prompted the reclassification of the
process through phase I (SERM/estrogen stimulated) to phase II
(SERM-stimulated/estrogen-inhibited growth; ref. 111).
This model would also explain the earlier observations (13) why
high-dose estrogen therapy was only effective as a treatment for
breast cancer in women many years after the menopause. Natural
estrogen deprivation had occurred. The process is accelerated and
enhanced, however, in patients treated long term with SERMs or
aromatase inhibitors so that only low doses of estrogen are
necessary to cause experimental tumors to regress. The new
knowledge of the apoptotic action of estrogen (or androgen—see

next section) could potentially lead to the discovery of a precise
apoptotic trigger initiated naturally by steroid hormone receptors
(111). Discovery of this apoptotic trigger might result in an
application that targets critical survival signals with new drugs.

Parallel Path of the Prostate
Charles Huggins (Fig. 3; ref. 112) resurrected the use of
endocrine ablation for the treatment hormone-dependent breast
cancers. His focus, however, was the regulation of the growth of
the prostate gland and the application of that knowledge for the
treatment of prostate cancer (4). He received the Nobel Prize for
Physiology and Medicine in 1966. The process for deciphering the
molecular mechanisms of androgen action in its target tissues
and prostate cancer has tended to lag behind the pathfinder
estrogen. Nevertheless, the basic model for the regulation of
nuclear hormone receptor action is consistent but the details of
androgen action are distinctly different than estrogen action,
which in turn created novel therapeutic opportunities to stop the
biosynthesis of each active steroidal agent. The similarities and
differences in the molecular actions of estrogen and androgen
action are illustrated in Fig. 8. The two significant differences (yet
similarities) in the biosynthetic pathways between estrogens and
androgens are as follows: (a) the aromatization of the A ring of
testosterone to create the high-affinity ER binding ligand 17h
estradiol in women. This bioactivation led to the development of
aromatase inhibitors to block estrogen synthesis (50); and (b) the
reduction of testosterone to the high-affinity AR binding ligand
dihydroxytestosterone in men. This knowledge led to the
development of the 5a reductase inhibitor finesteride (Fig. 4)
that was tested successfully for risk reduction for prostate cancer
in men (113). Unfortunately, as yet, finesteride has failed to
advance for use as a chemopreventive for prostate cancer because
of overstated concerns about the accelerated development of
potentially more aggressive prostate cancers in those men who
did not have tumorigenesis prevented. In contrast, aromatase

inhibitors have advanced to test their worth as chemopreventive
agents (53).
A range of antiandrogenic drugs that competitively block the AR
are available in clinical practice (114). Drug resistance to
antiandrogen therapy parallels antiestrogen drug resistance (115),
and following long-term antihormonal therapy with antiandrogens,
androgen induces apoptosis in antiandrogen-resistant prostate
cancer cells (116). Recent research has identified high local levels of
androgen production as a major form of antihormonal drug
resistance (117). As a result, a new therapeutic approach is the
development of an inhibitor of androgens biosynthesis from
cholesterol (Fig. 8) by blocking 17 hydroxylase/17,20 lyase. A
promising compound abiraterone acetate (Fig. 4) is currently being
evaluated in clinical trials (118). However, there is also a need to
coadminister glucocorticoids so long term therapy must be
monitored carefully.

The Successful Evolution of Targeted Antihormonal
Therapy in the 20th Century and Beyond
The identification of the ER and subsequently the AR as the
conduit for hormone-mediated development and growth in breast
and prostate cancer, respectively, has had a profound effect on the
approach to the treatment and prevention of cancers. These

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

hormone-mediating molecules have proved to be the pathfinders
for the development of targeted therapies that transformed the
approach to cancer treatment away from the nonspecific cytotoxic
chemotherapy approach during the 1950s to 1990s. As a result,
there is current enthusiasm about the promise of individualized
medicine and tumor-specific therapeutics (25, 119).
The effect of antihormonal therapy for breast cancer has been
profound with improvements in patient survival, a menu of
medicines is now available to suit individual patient needs and
there is a decrease in national mortality rates in numerous
countries (47). Additionally, there are now two SERMS (tamoxifen
and raloxifene) available to reduce the incidence of breast cancer
(67, 82). But progress in our understanding and application of
SERMs is more than chemoprevention. The SERM concept (70) has
spread to develop tissue-selective drugs for all members of the
hormone receptor superfamily (25, 120). An enormous interest in
developing selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators, selective
progesterone receptor modulators, SARMs, and even agents to
treat rheumatoid arthritis is an ongoing therapeutic outcome of
translational research for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.
