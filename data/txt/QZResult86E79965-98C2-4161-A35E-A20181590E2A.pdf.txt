ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma is an aggressive tumor that occurs in both adult and pediatric
patients and is known for its invasive quality and high rate of recurrence. Current
therapies for glioblastoma result in high morbidity and dismal outcomes. The TAM
subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases includes Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK. Axl and MerTK
exhibit little to no expression in normal brain but are highly expressed in glioblastoma
and contribute to the critical malignant phenotypes of survival, chemosensitivity and
migration. We have found that Foretinib, a RTK inhibitor currently in clinical trial,
inhibited phosphorylation of TAM receptors, with highest efficacy against MerTK, and
blocked downstream activation of Akt and Erk in adult and pediatric glioblastoma
cell lines, findings that are previously unreported. Survival, proliferation, migration,
and collagen invasion were hindered in vitro. Foretinib treatment in vivo abolished
MerTK phosphorylation and reduced tumor growth 3-4 fold in a subcutaneous mouse
model. MerTK targeted shRNA completely prevented intracranial and subcutaneous
glioma growth further delineating the impact of MerTK inhibition on glioblastoma.
Our findings provide additional target validation for MerTK inhibition in glioblastoma
and demonstrate that robust MerTK inhibition can be achieved with the multikinase inhibitor Foretinib as an innovative and translational therapeutic approach to
glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

including glioblastoma, and in some cases Axl or MerTK
overexpression or co-expression has been correlated with
poor clinical outcomes [11-14]. Interestingly, there is
little to no expression of either Axl or MerTK in normal
CNS tissues [9, 13, 15], making targeting TAM RTKs an
attractive novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma is characterized by insistent growth,
high rate of migration and relentless recurrence, with
30,000 new patients diagnosed annually [16]. It is one of
the most common solid tumors in both pediatric and young
adult patients and remains relatively incurable [17]. The
standard backbone therapy consists of surgical resection
and radiotherapy results in a median survival time of 12
months, while the addition of temozolimide increases
the median survival time to 16 months [18, 19]. In
addition to being largely non-curative, these therapies are
devastating in a developing pediatric brain with profound
consequences on neuro-cognition, growth, and endocrine

The TAM subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) comprised of Tyro3, Axl and MerTK, have high
structural homology and share a common ligand Gas6.
The hallmarks of this family include two fibronectin type
III domains, two immunoglobulin-like domains and a
conserved sequence within the kinase domain [1]. TAM
RTKs have a tissue-specific expression pattern, with higher
expression in the immune, nervous and reproductive
systems [2-5]. TAM RTKs have well described normal
physiologic functions including phagocytosis, synaptic
pruning, immune-regulation and sexual maturation [69]. Notably, MerTK activation leads to known antiapoptotic survival signal, mediating through the MAPK
and PI3K pathways both in normal conditions as well as
situations of oxidative stress [10]. Aberrant expression of
Axl and MerTK has been described in multiple cancers,

function [20]. Targeted therapies against RTKs, such as
EGFR (Gefitinib), have thus far not produced a significant
survival advantage over standard therapy. This is likely
due to the large amount of molecular heterogeneity found
between individual patient tumors; only a minority of
patients has overexpression of the RTK being targeted.
Additionally, many tumors have RTKs that are mutated
and consequently are not susceptible to targeted inhibition.
In contrast, we have previously found that there is high
aberrant expression of either MerTK or Axl in all grades
of astrocytic tumors tested, and that co-expression of
MerTK and Axl was present in all high grade gliomas and
glioblastoma patient samples [15], additionally sequence
analysis found no receptor mutations (unpublished data).
We have also shown that knockdown of MerTK and Axl
by stable shRNA resulted in vitro in increased apoptosis,
decreased cell proliferation, and improved sensitivity to
temozolimide, carboplatin, and vincristine [15]. Inhibition
of MerTK was found to greatly reduce glioblastoma
migration and alter cellular morphology [21]. From this
data we sought to study the effects of MerTK, and perhaps
Axl and Tyro3, inhibition in vivo utilizing a multi-kinase
translational inhibitor which effectively blocks activation
of these receptors.
Foretinib is a kinase inhibitor whose best known
targets are c-Met and VEGFR2/KDR [22]. Currently,
there are a number of phase II clinical trials in progress
using Foretinib to treat breast, liver and gastric cancers,

papillary renal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell head
and neck cancer [23-28]. Although Foretinib was designed
as a cMet/VEGFR inhibitor, it has reported activity against
Axl at lower concentrations than cMet [28], however the
ability to target MerTK and Tyro3 has not previously been
described.
With this study, we establish for the first time that
Foretinib inhibits all of the TAM family members, and
has highest potency against MerTK in the glioblastoma
cells studied. We demonstrate that with Foretinib therapy
we can replicate the in vitro inhibition of survival and
migration of glioblastoma seen following TAM RTK
genetic inhibition, and we validate the therapeutic
potential of TAM inhibition in in vivo models and the
necessity of MerTK for glioblastoma tumor growth.

RESULTS
Foretinib inhibits the activation of TAM family
receptors in glioblastoma cells.
Inhibition of TAM family members may be a novel
therapeutic approach to treat glioblastoma; therefore we
evaluated the phosphorylation state of the TAM family
members in response to Foretinib treatment in the adult
glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and A172, and the pediatric

(middle) and SF188 (right) glioblastoma cells were left untreated (untx), treated with vehicle only (cntrl), or with Foretinib at increasing
concentrations. Cells were harvested at 1 hr in the presence of pervanadate and whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated
with antibodies against the TAM family members, and resolved with SDS PAGE. Samples were blotted for the activated phospho- form
(P-TAM) and stripped and re-probed for the total form (t-TAM). b. Similar cell preparations were collected without pervanadate treatment,
resolved with SDS PAGE directly and immunoblotted for the known target of Foretinib, activated c-Met (P-cMet) and total cMet (t-cMet)
in U251 (left), A172 (middle) and SF188 (right) cells. Tubulin was used as a loading control. Blots are representative of three independent

glioblastoma cell line SF188. Foretinib treatment at the
lowest concentration tested, 100 nM, completely inhibited
the phosphorylation of MerTK in all three cell lines (Figure
1A). Similarly, phospho-Axl was inhibited considerably at
all concentrations tested in the U251 cell line, while in the
SF188 line inhibition followed a concentration dependent
trend. The A172 cell line showed partial inhibition of Axl
activation at 100nM that did not increase with increasing
doses in the range tested. The phosphorylation of Tyro3
in the U251 cell line was inhibited at 900 nM Foretinib,
however, conclusions of the level of activation/inhibition
of Tyro3 regarding the other two cell lines cannot be
accurately assessed from this data because total levels
of Tyro3 changed as well. Most notably, Foretinib at 100
nM did not inhibit the phosphorylation of cMet in U251
cells (Figure 1B left panel). SF188 cells do not seem
to have appreciable activation of cMet even at baseline

and likely does not have a large role in the downstream
signals nor the functional phenotypes of this cell line
despite having similar levels of total cMet as the U251
and A172 cells (Figure 1B right panel). MerTK is more
highly expressed in SF188 cells compared to U251 cells,
whereas the opposite is true for Axl (data not shown). We
have shown that the lowest concentration of Foretinib
(100 nM) used in this study always inhibited the activity
of MerTK, whereas the higher concentrations of Foretinib
(300-900 nM) inhibited the activity of Axl, Tyro3. From
this we conclude that activation of TAM family members,
and specifically MerTK, are successfully blocked in
glioblastoma at concentrations lower than 1mM.

Foretinib inhibits activation of
signaling pathways in glioblastoma.

Next, we investigated the involvement of
downstream kinase signaling pathways in response
to Foretinib. Foretinib treatment decreased Akt
phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner in
all three cell lines at 1 h (Figure 2A). Akt activity was
still decreased at the 3 and 24 h time point (Figure 2C).
Similar results were seen with phospho-ERK (Figure 2A),
but it had no effect on p38 (data not shown). Moreover,
indication of the apoptotic effect by Foretinib treatment
was evidenced by PARP cleavage assayed at 28 h posttreatment in full serum media (Figure 2B). Therefore,
Foretinib down-regulates pertinent oncogenic signaling
pathways known to be involved in survival, growth, and
apoptosis regulation.

Foretinib decreases short- and long-term cellular
survival in a dose dependent manner.
Foretinib robustly inhibits TAM signals, and
specifically MerTK, which are known to activate antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative signals [29-31]. To
investigate short- and long-term survival following
treatment with Foretinib, we used two different
approaches: measurement of metabolic activity (MTT
reduction) at 48 hrs in serum-free media and long term
proliferation in a soft agar non-adherent growth assay.
To highlight short-term survival following Foretinib
treatment, we used serum-free culture conditions in order
to assess cells in the absence of exogenous, over-abundant
TAM ligands found in serum. Survival was markedly
reduced by 50-83% with 900 nM Foretinib treatment in
all three cell lines (Figure 3A). Survival of SF188 cells
was reduced by the very low treatment concentration
of 100 nM Foretinib, and was further inhibited in a
dose dependent manner (Figure 3A). Current standard
of care for glioblastoma relies upon local control with
surgical resection and radiation therapy. Many adjuvant
chemotherapy and biotherapy approaches have been

prepared and resolved by SDS PAGE. Samples were blotted for
the phospho- form and re-probed for the respective total form
of Akt and ERK1/2. b. Cells in full serum media were treated
as described, harvested at 28 hrs and probed for apoptotic
indicators, PARP and PARP cleavage (cl. PARP). c. Whole cell
lysates were also harvested after treatment as described from
U251 cells after continuous treatment of foretinib for 3 and 24
hrs to assess the longevity of downstream pathway inhibition.

attempted with little success; one exception has been the
addition of temozolomide (TMZ) cytotoxic chemotherapy,
which extended the median survival of patients by several
months [18]. We sought to characterize cell survival with
the addition of Foretinib to treatment with temozolomide,
as this has become a standard therapy for many glioma

patients and would likely form the backbone of a clinical
trial. Using an in vitro analysis in serum replete media
we found that Foretinib multi-kinase inhibition does
not impede TMZ associated cell death (Figure 3B). The
U251 and A172 cell lines are considered TMZ sensitive
because the DNA repair protein O(6)-methylguanine-

in 96 well plates and treated with vehicle only (Control) or Foretinib at the indicated doses. Cell number was assessed with a MTT assay at
48 hr and normalized to control. The experiment was independently repeated three times and absorbance means and standard error of the
mean were calculated. b. U251, A172 and SF188 cells were plated in full serum in quadruplicate in 96 well plates and treated with Foretinib
and temozolomide at the indicated doses. Cell number was assessed with an MTT assay and measurement of absorbance at 48 hr. The
experiment was independently repeated three times and absorbance means and standard error of the mean were calculated and normalized
to vehicle only treatment (Foretinib 0 nM, temozolomide 0 uM). A mixed model repeated measurements ANOVA with a Bonferroni posttest adjustment was done to compare treatments alone and the various combinations to the control vehicle only treated and the single agent
treatments. c. U251 (top), A172 (middle) and SF188 (bottom) cells were plated in triplicate in soft agar and treated with vehicle only
(Control) or Foretinib at the indicated doses 2 times a week. Colonies were stained and counted at 3 weeks (n=3) and representative pictures
were taken. Colony count means were normalized to vehicle control and standard error of the mean was calculated. For both short- and
long-term analysis repeated measurements ANOVA with a Dunnet’s multiple comparison test (*P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001) was done
to compare treatment to control.

DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is not expressed due to
methylation of the promoter, while SF188 is considered
TMZ resistant because it does express MGMT [3234]. In all three cell lines the addition of Foretinib to
TMZ treatment resulted in similar to decreased cell
survival over TMZ alone, indicating that Foretinib has
the potential to be effectively added to current standard
therapy. Additional work needs to be done to evaluate
timing of treatments and expand concentrations tested
as well as introduce combination therapy into mouse
models of the disease. To evaluate the long-term survival
and proliferation of this solid tumor in an anchorage
independent environment we analyzed soft agar colony
formation at 3 weeks. Foretinib treatment significantly

diminished long-term growth, with colony formation
reduced to 37-74% of vehicle control with only 100 nM
Foretinib treatment (Figure 3C). Notably, the SF188 cells
showed quite significant inhibition of short- and long-term
survival and proliferation, likely in large part due to TAM
RTK inhibition as there is very little/no activation of cMet
related signaling in this line.

Foretinib abrogates migration and invasion of
glioma cells in a dose dependent manner.
One of the major barriers to effective treatment of
glioblastoma is its ability to migrate extensively out of

(middle) and SF188 (right) cells were plated in triplicate in xCELLigence CIM-Plates transwell cultures with 8 um pores and treated with
vehicle only (Control) or Foretinib at the indicated doses and migration was measured as electrical impedence at the point of the transwell at
10 hr. Cell index means and standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments and normalized to vehicle. A repeated

pictures were taken. c. Absolute maximal radius of each neurosphere was measured, and the mean and standard error of three independent
experiments was graphed. A two-sided t-test was done at 24 hr to compare treatment to vehicle control (*P<0.05).

the site of local control leading to relapse. We quantified
cellular transwell migration in response to Foretinib
using the xCELLigence real time cell analysis system.
Foretinib treatment inhibited cell migration at the lowest
concentration of 100nM in all three cell lines at 10 h
post treatment, with U251 impeded to 59.8% of control,
A172 to 80% of control, and SF188 to 81% of control
(Figure 4A). Increasing doses of Foretinib further impeded
migration in the A172 and SF188 cell lines, decreasing
migration to 72-73% of control at 300 nM and 52-59%

of control at 900 nM respectively (Figure 4A). This
abrogation of transwell migration is not due to a change in
cell number; we plated cells in parallel conditions to the
transwell xCELLigence assay and then enumerated total
cell number over the short timeframe of the experiment
(10 h) and no changes in cell number were noted
(Supplemental Figure S1).
In order to frame cellular movement more
appropriately in the context of glioma, we chose a
glioblastoma neurosphere model to perform a three

were allowed to establish over 8 weeks. Mice were randomized into one of three groups: A control group received vehicle only, every other
day (QOD) by oro-gastric (OG) administration for the entirety, another group initiated Foretinib treatment at 30 mg/kg QOD OG at 8 weeks
post injection (Foretinib MRD), and the final group received the same Foretinib dosing regimen, initiated when the tumor reached 125 mm3
(Foretinib ET). Tumors were measured twice weekly by caliper and mean and standard error of the volumes were calculated. a. Vehicle
(n=10) and Foretinib MRD (n=7) treated mice, which started therapy at 8 weeks post injection, had tumor volumes compared with a paired
two-tailed t-test (p-values are provided) and b. a Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival (survival endpoint defined as sacrifice due to tumor
size in excess of 2500 mm3 or morbidity due to tumor) with a log rank Mantel-Cox test statistical comparison (p-values are provided). c. A
subset of the Foretinib MRD treated mice (n=4) had therapy discontinued at 8 weeks (down arrow) and tumor volumes were compared to
vehicle and continuous Foretinib therapy (n=3). An ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was used for statistical comparison to vehicle control
(**P<0.01; ***P<0.001). d. Two tumors (vehicle (lanes 1-3) and foretinib treated (lanes 4-6)) were resected and immediately homogenized
in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor with freshly prepared pervanadate (lanes 2 and 5) and without (lanes 3 and 6). Lanes 1 and 4 are
samples that were not homogenized. Samples were resolved with SDS PAGE and then blotted for the activated phospho- form (P-Mer) and
stripped and re-probed for the total form (t-Mer) to test for target inhibition. e. Vehicle (n=10) and Foretinib ET (n=5) treated mice, which

dimensional collagen invasion assay. U251, SF188, and
A172 cells were induced to form neurospheres [35],
plated in collagen in 96 well plates, and treated with
Foretinib. Migration of cells from the core of individual
neurospheres were tracked and imaged at 15 and 24 h
post treatment (Figure 4B and C). The absolute maximal
radius of each neurosphere (core and furthest reaching
cell) was measured and normalized to the radius at the
time of plating (Time 0). Each data point represents
the mean of three independent experiments where five

individual neurospheres were matched and analyzed.
TAM inhibition with Foretinib impeded the glioblastoma
cellular invasion through a collagen matrix in all three cell
lines both visually (Figure 4B) and quantitatively (Figure
4C). The lowest concentration of Foretinib impeded cell
migration in A172 and SF188. In conclusion, Foretinib
inhibits migration and invasion of glioblastoma in vitro,
targeting two of the more aggressive features of clinical
glioblastoma.

Foretinib, a TAM RTK inhibitor, is an effective
treatment for established subcutaneous human
glioblastoma tumors and increases overall
survival.

tumors underwent protein extraction by three different
methods: without homogenization (lanes 1 and 4, which
resulted in unacceptable phospho-protein recovery), with
homogenization in the presence of pervanadate (lanes 2
and 5), and with homogenization alone (lanes 3 and 6).
The blot was stripped and re-probed for total MerTK
(Figure 5D).
In the established tumor (ET) model analysis, the
vehicle treated control group (n=10) had rapid tumor
growth after reaching the 125 mm3 treatment initiation cutoff, and surpassed 1000 mm3 tumor volume at a median
of 4.5 weeks later while in the Foretinib ET therapy
group (n=5) tumor growth was suppressed through the
entire treatment period even in these well-established
tumors (Figure 5E). Tumors in the ET group treated with
Foretinib were statistically smaller throughout the entirety
of the treatment, and at the end of the 8 weeks of therapy
the mean tumor volume in the vehicle control mice was
2721 mm3 (95% CI: 2181-3261 mm3) while the Foretinib
treated mice it was 807 mm3 (95% CI: 351-1261 mm3).
The median survival for vehicle treated mice was 7.5
weeks, while it was extended to 21 weeks in the Foretinib
ET treated mice despite the rapidity of tumor growth in the
ET group prior to the start of therapy (Figure 5F).

Using U251 cells, we tested efficacy of Foretinib
in an in vivo subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of
human glioblastoma. Two different schedules were used:
Foretinib was started at 8 weeks after cell injection, when
the tumors were not yet in log-phase growth, mimicking a
minimal residual disease (MRD) tumor burden that would
remain following upfront surgical and radiation treatment;
at this time the mean tumor volume was 51.5 mm3 (range
25.1 to 82.5 mm3) (Figure 5A,B), alternatively, animals
were left untreated until the tumors were established
(ET), defined by robust and rapid growth with a tumor
volume of at least 125 mm3 (occurred between 10.5-15.5
weeks post injection) (Figure 5E,F). Animals were treated
with vehicle as a control or with Foretinib at 30 mg/kg
via orogastric administration every other day (QOD). We
also explored the discontinuation of therapy following
Foretinib therapy for 8 weeks, to further verify the critical
role of Foretinib in inhibiting glioblastoma tumor growth
(Figure 5C). Tumor volume was significantly decreased
on both Foretinib treatment schedules compared with
vehicle treatment regardless of whether Foretinib was
started early or late in tumor development (Figure 5A and
E). In the MRD treatment arm, tumors in the vehicle only
control group (n=10) grew rapidly and surpassed a 750
mm3 median tumor volume at 6 weeks, while Foretinib
MRD treated (n=7) mice never hit that threshold while
on therapy (beyond 16.5 weeks). Tumors in the Foretinib
MRD treated group were statistically smaller throughout
the entirety of the treatment (Figure 5A), and at the end
of the 8 weeks of therapy, the mean tumor volume in the
vehicle control mice was 1702 mm3 (95% CI: 986-2420
mm3) while the Foretinib MRD treated mice it was 388
mm3 (95% CI: 117-659 mm3). The median survival for
the vehicle only treated group was 10 weeks, while none
of the mice on Foretinib MRD treatment reached tumor
size endpoint requiring sacrifice (20 mm in any dimension,
calculated volume of 2500 mm3, or morbidity due to
tumor) while on therapy (Figure 5B). In the small subset
of mice where treatment was discontinued at 8 weeks
(n=4), the tumors quickly resumed logarithmic growth
and the mice were euthanized between 4 and 7.5 weeks
later due to reaching tumor size endpoint (Figure 5C),
emphasizing the principal role of Foretinib inhibition on
tumor growth. Foretinib very effectively targets MerTK
activation in vivo as evidenced by the immunoblot
showing significantly inhibited MerTK phosphorylation in
the treated tumor as opposed to the vehicle treated tumor
(Figure 5D). The blot is representative of a tumor removed
from a mouse that was vehicle treated (left 3 lanes) or one
that was Foretinib treated (right three lanes). Each of these

MerTK signaling is required for glioblastoma
growth in vivo.
To illustrate the importance of MerTK in
glioblastoma growth we developed genetically
inhibited cell lines to use in in vivo modeling; U251
cells were transduced with shMerTK and sorted based
on expression levels of MerTK following puromycin
selection. Clonal cell lines were developed exhibiting
stable and substantial MerTK knockdown (Figure 6A).
U251 cells with MerTK knockdown or parental U251
cells were implanted subcutaneously. Tumor growth, by
caliper measurement, in the control cells was rapid and
pronounced with a final mean tumor volume of 1603.9
mm3 (range 1053.3 to 2068.6 mm3) at 18.5 weeks postinjection (p.i.), while growth was profoundly inhibited
with shMerTK knockdown (Figure 6B), with a final mean
tumor volume of 63.4 mm3 (range 20.7 to 134.5 mm3).
Additionally, we pursued an orthotopic intracranial mouse
model using these same cell lines, as the ultrastructure
and microenvironment outside of the tumor would be
most closely aligned with the human condition. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) done approximately every three
weeks starting at 8 weeks p.i. demonstrated a profound
difference in tumor growth, with all mice (n=6) in the
control group having measureable tumor volumes by 12
weeks p.i. and significant tumor burden by 15 weeks p.i.
(Figure 6C and 6D), while not a single shMerTK (n=6)
had any tumor growth at that time. The median survival of
the control mice was 15 weeks p.i., while all animals with
1345

shMerTK cells injected were alive and without significant
disease burden at 38 weeks p.i. (Figure 6D). These
results confirm the critical function of MerTK for in vivo
glioblastoma growth. Furthermore, this study demonstrates
that treatment with a translational tyrosine kinase inhibitor
which effectively blocks MerTK activation yields similar
effects in vitro and in vivo to selective MerTK knockdown
via shRNA.

in the case of the pediatric SF188 cell line, there is little to
no activation of cMet at baseline (Figure 1B), suggesting
that the downstream signaling changes and phenotypes
illustrated in that line are due in large part to inhibition
of the TAM family RTKs, and most specifically MerTK.
We investigated the effect of TAM inhibition with
Foretinib on both short-term survival of glioblastoma
cells using an MTT assay and long-term proliferation
in a soft agar colony growth assay and discovered that
Foretinib inhibited tumor cell survival in both settings.
The MTT assay specifically measures cellular metabolic
activity after a short treatment period, and indicates the
cells capacity to survive TAM inhibition. With even the
single and brief Foretinib treatment cellular survival was
greatly reduced, likely through the well described decrease
in anti-apoptotic signaling that follows TAM inhibition,
which is also evidenced by our data of diminished PI3K
and MAPK activation as well as PARP cleavage. We also
showed that PARP is cleaved with increasing levels of
Foretinib treatment under fed conditions suggesting that
Foretinib alone, even without an additional stressor such
as starvation, is able to initiate the apoptosis pathway.
Non-adherent growth of solid tumors in soft agar has
been successfully used as a measure of malignant growth
potential, and we used this to further delineate the longterm effects of TAM inhibition with Foretinib. Foretinib
treatment greatly diminished long-term colony formation,
and there is considerable reduction at the very lowest dose
of 100 nM, suggesting the substantial role of MerTK in the
malignant growth potential of glioblastoma, as at this low
concentration it was the only RTK effectively inhibited
among those we have tested.
TAM family receptors act through various kinase
pathways that translate into changes in the cytoskeleton
and ultimately changes in migration and invasion. Previous
investigations have shown that a dominant negative form
of Axl resulted in less motility [40] and shRNA against
MerTK reduced cellular migration via altered FAK
signaling and total RhoA GTPase [21]. We found that
Foretinib alone had no effect on total RhoA GTPase, but
it remains unclear if it inhibits activation. Additionally,
shRNA against MerTK was shown to decrease tumor
cell invasion through actomyosin contractility [41]. Our
data confirm these findings with Foretinib inhibition of
MerTK and, to a lesser extent, Axl and Tyro3, results in
attenuated downstream signaling of Akt (2A & C) and
FAK (preliminary data). Other targets that are involved in
the migratory phenotype in glioblastoma include integrin
α3, but it remains to be seen if it is a downstream target of
Foretinib [42]. Foretinib interfered with functional effects
of MerTK and Axl activation in migration and invasion
assays, suggesting its potential as a therapy for GBM,
especially as additional downstream targets are elucidated.
Prevention of migration and invasion with TAM RTK
inhibition in this tumor type is critical as the mainstay of
effective therapy is likely to continue to be local control

DISCUSSION
Glioblastoma is a common and extremely aggressive
malignancy that exhibits extraordinary invasive potential
and a high level of recurrence; the outcomes are horrible
and useful therapies are limited. TAM receptors, a
subfamily in the receptor tyrosine kinase family, are a
relevant target in glioblastoma because they are aberrantly
expressed in glioblastoma and control both cellular
survival and migration. We now demonstrate for the first
time that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Foretinib effectively
inhibits TAM family members in glioblastoma, and most
robustly MerTK, leading to an inhibition of the critical
phenotypes of glioblastoma and a dramatic tumor response
in in vivo mouse models of disease.
We believe that MerTK and Axl are appropriate
targets for therapy against glioblastoma because
they exhibit little to no expression at both the mRNA
and protein level in the normal human brain but are
upregulated in glioblastoma and are readily activated by
the ubiquitously present Gas6 which is available in the
CNS in the normal and the diseased state [36]. Tyro3 is
more widely expressed in the normal brain [3, 37] but also,
in our studies, shows the smallest response to Foretinib.
We observed no toxic effects of Foretinib on normal, nonneoplastic mouse brain, and the ongoing phase II human
clinical trials will help elucidate the effects more clearly.
TAM family members are known to crosstalk with
other receptors. This study did not examine the cross
talk of the TAM family of receptors as they potentially
heterodimerize with each other or with RTKs outside
the family, but our data illustrates MerTK is inhibited
at even the lowest concentrations studied and that Axl
is inhibited starting at the moderate doses, as are the
common downstream pathways. It is likely that any
crosstalk signaling is at the least inhibited similarly. cMet
is the RTK that is most closely related to the TAM family
and is the described target of Foretinib, and it has been
previously shown that Foretinib inhibits cMet and Axl
at similar concentrations [38]. Our data demonstrate that
inhibition of cMet activation doesn’t occur until moderate
to high doses of Foretinib, well beyond the concentration
needed for inhibition of MerTK, indicating a likely higher
affinity for the kinase domain of MerTK. Another study
using LY2801653, a small molecule inhibitor closely
related to Foretinib, showed that MerTK is inhibited at a
50-fold lower concentration than cMet [39]. Additionally,

with surgery and radiotherapy.
Temozolomide (TMZ) has been in use to treat
glioblastoma for over a decade, and is an alkylating agent
that methylates DNA and triggers apoptosis. The promoter
methylation status of the MGMT gene dictates the efficacy
of this treatment because it is a methylation repair enzyme.
In glioblastoma tumors that are sensitive to TMZ, it does
reliably extend survival from 12 months to 15 months. In
previous work we have shown that inhibition of MerTK
and Axl with shRNA improves chemosensitivity to
several standard therapies including temozolomide, and
here we reiterate that TAM inhibition with Foretinib
work effectively together utilizing two cell lines that are
described as TMZ sensitive, U251 and A172, and one
considered resistant, SF188. Future studies will need to
explore other translational TAM inhibition strategies
with a variety of cytotoxic chemo- and radio-therapies to
determine best sequence and combination of therapies.
Our data illustrate that TAM inhibition either with
Foretinib or with genetic knockdown showed robust
anti-tumor activity in multiple models of disease. In our
experience, U251 cells injected into the subcutaneous
flank of nude mice typically smolder for a period of 8-10
weeks before appreciable tumor growth begins; this model
mimics a minimal residual disease (MRD) state that might
be found in the clinical setting following surgical resection
and radiation therapy. Foretinib treatment initiated at
8 weeks post-injection (Foretinib MRD) substantially
hindered tumor growth; tumors remained significantly
smaller compared to vehicle-treated control until Foretinib
treatment was discontinued, at which time tumors showed
a quick upturn in growth rate, reaching tumor endpoint
size rather rapidly, indicating the potential for ongoing
malignant growth that is very effectively diminished by
TAM RTK inhibition with Foretinib. The other treatment
arm, where Foretinib was delayed until the animal had a
rapidly growing established tumor (Foretinib ET, greater
than 125 mm3), is a model of glioblastoma as it typically
presents at diagnosis and relapse; this therapeutic arm also
led to considerable reduction of tumor size and control of
tumor growth.
Previous reports have established the importance of
Axl in human and xenograft glioma tumor growth [13,
40], although those reports did not explore the presence or
relative inhibition of MerTK. Our work now demonstrates
that MerTK plays an equally critical role. We confirmed
the essential role of MerTK with subcutaneous and
intracranial models of glioma utilizing lines that had
genetic inhibition of MerTK, this allows for both exclusive
targeting as well as more thorough inhibition of signaling.
The specific and concentrated inhibition of MerTK
resulted in profoundly inhibited tumor development,
both in the flank and the intracranial orthotopic models.
Foretinib therapy provides a unique inhibition of both
Axl and MerTK, and future testing will test the relative
roles of each TAM member individually and the effects
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of combination therapy as well as therapeutic penetration
through the blood brain barrier.
In conclusion, we have shown that MerTK is
essential for glioblastoma growth. Foretinib, an RTK
inhibitor that targets TAM family members, with
highest efficacy towards MerTK, effectively inhibited
proliferation, survival, migration and invasion of human
glioblastoma cells in vitro by blocking phosphorylation of
the TAM kinase motif. TAM RTK inhibition significantly
interfered with tumor growth and, importantly, increased
median overall survival in both a subcutaneous xenograft
and intracranial orthotopic mouse model. By targeting the
most characteristic survival and invasive properties of
glioblastoma, we assert that TAM inhibition with agents
such as Foretinib has the potential to be an important and
novel addition to glioblastoma treatment options.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents.
The U251 and A172 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, U.S.A.)
while the SF188 cell line was obtained from the UCSF
Brain Tumor Bank; all were maintained in DMEM + 10%
fetal bovine serum per culture guidelines, unless otherwise
indicated. Cell lines were authenticated by DNA fingerprinting bi-annually through the CU Cancer Center DNA
Sequencing and Analysis Core Facility [43]. All antibodies
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, U.S.A.) unless otherwise noted. GSK1363089G
(Foretinib) was kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline
(Brentford, Middlesex, UK) via MTA. Stock solutions
were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO aka vehicle)
and stored in aliquots at -20 oC. All reagents were obtained
from Life Technologies, unless otherwise noted.

Production of shRNA clones.
Lentiviral vectors (pLKO.1) containing shRNA
sequences targeting MerTK (shMerTK, oligo ID:
TRCN0000000862) or non-silencing control green
fluorescent protein (GFP; shGFP) were obtained from
Open Biosystems. Replication incompetent viral particles
were generated using the 293FT cell line and the thirdgeneration packaging system (two packaging plasmids
and one envelope plasmid) developed by the laboratory
of Dr. Didier Trono. Puromycin-resistant colonies were
typically observed on days 9 to 13. Stable, clonal lines
were developed from heterogenous MerTK shRNA
knockdown cell populations by single-cell flow cytometry
sorting for low MerTK expression.

in DMEM + 10% FBS (final concentrations of 900nM,
300nM, and 100nM). Migration was quantified every
10 min for 20 h. Three independent experiments were
performed.

Cultured cells were treated with Foretinib or vehicle
for 1 h. Freshly made pervanadate (0.12 mM Na3VO4 in
0.0002% H2O2) was added to samples where indicated
as a phosphate stabilizer for 5 min before collecting
protein lysate. Lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,
150 nM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM Na2MoO4) with protease
inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
was added to each well, rocked on ice for 15 min, and
then scraped. The lysate was divided and incubated with
the appropriate antibody (MerTK: MAB8912, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Axl: R&D Systems AF154;
Tyro3: Epitomics EPR4308) and Protein G-sepharose
beads 4B with rotisserie rotation overnight. Immune
complexes were washed thoroughly and heated to 95 oC
for 5 min in Laemmli Sample Buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl
pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 5% β-Mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS
and 0.01% bromophenol blue). Samples were resolved
using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose using
the iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were blotted with antiMerTK (ab52968, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-Tyro3
(Epitomics EPR4308) or anti-Axl (R&D Systems AF154).

Neurosphere 3D collagen invasion assay.
1 x 104 cells were cultured in Neurobasal Medium
A supplemented with B27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, 20 ng/
mL hEGF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 20 ng/mL
bFGF (Sigma-Aldrich) in ultra-low adherent 24-well
plates (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) for 24 h to
allow formation of neurospheres [35]. Neurospheres of
75-150 um were resuspended in type I collagen (2.17 mg/
mL)/DMEM + 10% FBS and appropriate treatments and
plated in a 96-well plate pre-coated with type I collagen
(Advanced BioMatrix, San Diego, CA). Neurospheres
were imaged immediately (Time 0) with an Olympus
CKX41 fitted with a Qicam Fast 1394 camera and then
again at 15 and 24 h. Absolute maximal radius of each
neurosphere was measured using ImageJ software and
this distance was used to determine the relative change in
radius. Three independent experiments were performed.

Soft agar colony formation.
Six-well plates were layered with 0.5% agar in 1.5
mL of DMEM + 10% FBS, followed by plating of cell
lines suspended in 0.35% agar in 1.5 mL DMEM + 10%
FBS. U251 cells were plated at 3 x 104 cells per well,
while A172 and SF188 cells were plated at 1 x 105 cell
per well. Treatments (DMSO or Foretinib) were added to
triplicate wells. Cells were incubated for 3 weeks at 37
o
C and 5% CO2, with replacement of media and treatment
twice weekly. The cells were stained with nitrotetrazolium
blue (1 mg/mL) 48 h prior to counting and colonies
were scored electronically with an automated colony
counter, GelCount (Oxford Optronix, Oxford, UK). Three
independent experiments were performed.

Immunoblotting of downstream kinases and
apoptotic proteins.
Protein lysates were prepared as described without
pervanadate. Total protein concentrations were determined
by the Protein 660 nm Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL). Samples were prepared for immunoblotting
as described. Antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Boston, MA), unless otherwise
indicated. Antibodies used were: Phospho-Met (Tyr1003)
(13D11) Rabbit mAb #313, total-Met Rabbit mAb #4560,
phospho-Akt (Ser473) (D9E) XP® Rabbit mAb #4060,
total-Akt #9272S, Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2)
(Thr202/Tyr204) (D13.14.4E) XP® Rabbit mAb #4370,
p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) Antibody #9102, PARP #9542S,
and α-Tubulin (11H10) Rabbit mAb #2125.

Survival and proliferation using xCELLigence.
An xCELLigence E-plate 16 containing only 100
µL of DMEM + 10% FBS was incubated for 30 min at
room temperature and scanned on the xCELLigence
RTCA. A serial dilution of Foretinib in DMEM +10%
FBS and vehicle control solution was prepared as
previously described. Adherent cells at approximately
70% confluency were collected using 0.02% EDTA and
resuspended at a concentration of 1 x104/ 100 µL, plated
in triplicate, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min
to allow for cell adherence. Cell index, which represents
total cell number, was measured every 15 min over the
length of the experiments. Three independent experiments

xCELLigence migration assay.
The migration assays were conducted as previously
described [21, 44]. Briefly, adherent cells at 70%
confluency were collected using 0.02% EDTA and
resuspended at a concentration of 3 x 104 cells/50 µL.
Cells were plated in triplicate with media in the CIM-plate
16 (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and allowed to
adhere to the plates free of therapeutics for 1 h. Cells were
treated with either vehicle or a serial dilution of Foretinib

mouse reached defined morbidity endpoint, tumor was
2500 mm3 or greater for two measurements, or 30 weeks
p.i.. Two tumors (vehicle and foretinib treated) were
resected and immediately homogenized in lysis buffer
with protease inhibitor with and without freshly prepared
pervanadate. The protein samples were prepared for gel
electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The nitrocellulose
membrane was incubated with the phospho MerTK
antibody (ab52968) overnight, then stripped and reprobed
for total MerTK (MAB8912) the following day. For the
orthotopic mouse model of human glioblastoma that was
developed to study tumor growth in the context of brain
microenvironment, a small volume of U251 shMerTK or
control parental cells (4x104) were suspended in serumfree DMEM and injected into the cerebral cortex at 2.5
mm lateral (right) and 1.5 mm anterior to the bregma,
at a depth of 3.5 mm below the skull surface of athymic
nude mice (6 to 12 weeks old) that are anesthetized
and immobilized. A microultrapump injected the cell
suspension at a very slow rate (400 to 600 nl/min) to
minimize leakage into surrounding tissues. Tumor growth
was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
and without gadolinium injection approximately every
3 weeks. Tumor volumes were measured by Paravision
Preclinical MRI Software (Bruker, Billerica, MA).

MTT assay.
Cells were seeded on 96-well cell culture plates and
allowed to recover overnight. Media was aspirated and
replaced with media containing treatments (Foretinib,
temozolomide, vehicle, or serum free media). Two days
after treatment, MTT reagent (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) was added to each
well and incubated for 4 h. Next, solubilization solution
(10% SDS, 0.01 M HCl) was added and incubated
overnight. The plates were read at absorbance 570 nm
and 690 nm for normalization purposes. Four independent
experiments were performed.

Xenograft mouse models.
Athymic nude in a Balbc background (Foxn1nu) mice
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis,
IN). Animal care and experimental procedures were
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
University of Colorado Center for Comparative Medicine
and the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. All experiments included several
(n=3-5) mice in each control and experimental group and
each of the experiments was independently repeated on
two occasions separated by at least a month. Mice were
maintained on 0.3 mg/ml amoxicillin and 0.07 mg/ml
clavulonic acid (Clavamox) in drinking water (Pfizer
Animal Health, New York, NY). For the subcutaneous
mouse models, five- to seven-week old nude mice
were injected subcutaneously with 3 x 106 U251 cells
suspended in a total volume of 150 µl serum-free RPMI
(HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Tumors were
measured by caliper twice weekly starting one week post
injection (p.i.); volume was estimated by the calculation
V = LW2/2. Mice in the Foretinib treatment evaluation
were randomly assigned to either control or one of
two experimental treatment regimens and were treated
every other day by oral gavage with vehicle [VEH:
1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Ashland Specialty
Ingredients, Wilmington, DE) and 0.2% sodium lauryl
sulfate (Sigma Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) in di H20]
or with Foretinib 30 mg/kg suspended in VEH. The first
treatment regimen cohort began therapy at 8 weeks p.i.
when tumors were similar to minimal residual disease state
(Foretinib MRD). The second treatment regimen group
began when the tumor volume reached at least 125 mm3,
as this approximated when the tumor was well-established
(ET) and began rapid logarithmic growth, similar to what
is seen typically at initial clinical diagnosis or recurrence.
A discontinuation phase was also analyzed, following 8
weeks of Foretinib therapy (16 weeks p.i.), mice were
transitioned to VEH. Tumor volume was monitored until
