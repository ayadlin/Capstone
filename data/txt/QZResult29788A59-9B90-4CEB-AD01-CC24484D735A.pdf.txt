Abstract
Virtually all human cancers encounter disruption of the ‘‘p53
network.’’ From a therapeutic point of view, it is important to
devise strategies that eliminate cancer cells, which are often
defective in functional p53 and protect p53-expressing normal
cells. By comparing the response of a pair of isogenic cell
lines, we identify a plant-derived compound, Concanavalin A
(Con A), which differentially kills p53-null cells. Further, we
find that p53 family member, p73, plays a critical role that is
unmasked in the absence of p53. Con A treatment leads to
induction of p73 and several others that are important
mediators of apoptosis and act downstream, such as p21,
Bax, Foxo1a, and Bim. Inactivation of p73 reverses the
expression of these proteins and apoptosis. Inhibition of Akt
activation sensitizes otherwise resistant cells. These observations thus reveal a novel role for p73 in the regulation of
Akt-Foxo1a-Bim signaling and apoptosis especially when p53
is absent. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5617–21]

Introduction
In normal cells, the p53 tumor suppressor plays a pivotal role in
regulating the cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, genomic integrity,
and DNA repair in response to various forms of genotoxic stress
(1, 2). Due to its role in maintaining genomic integrity and cell
cycle checkpoints, p53 has been termed the ‘‘guardian of the
genome.’’ Unfortunately, p53 is mutated in f50% of human
cancers and functionally inactivated in a further 20% (1–3). It is
therefore important to devise therapeutic strategies that target
cancer cells with defective p53 while protecting normal cells. To
identify compounds that exhibit differential growth-inhibitory
effects dependent on p53 status, we compared isogenic human
fibroblasts lacking p53 with those reconstituted with a tetracyclineregulated p53 and the ovarian cancer cell SKOV3. Here, we report
that a plant-derived compound, Concanavalin A (Con A) promotes
apoptosis in cells lacking p53, whereas normal cells are much less
sensitive. Con A, a lectin derived from jack beans, is known to
cross-link cell surface glycoproteins, thereby initiating various
cellular responses, including T-cell activation, cell agglutination,
mitogenesis, and apoptosis (4–7). Con A also stimulates the
secretion and activation of both matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2
and MMP-9 in normal and transformed cells by activating the Rasmitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase
signaling (8, 9). Despite these major biological activities, the use

of Con A as a therapeutic drug is tempered by the lack of
knowledge by which Con A exerts these biological responses. In the
present study, we have investigated the mechanism of apoptosis
that operates in the absence of p53. We find that Con A selectively
induces apoptosis in cells lacking p53 and that p73 plays a crucial
role in this process by regulating the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and AktFoxo1a-Bim signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, plasmid transfection, and cell treatment. All cells were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin
and streptomycin in a CO2 incubator. For Con A treatment, 3  105
cells were plated in a 10-cm culture dish. After overnight incubation, the
old media were replaced with fresh one and the cells were treated with
15 Ag/mL Con A for the indicated times. 041 cells were transfected with
dominant-negative p73 using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to
supplier’s instruction. Individual clones were selected using G418.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. For apoptosis assay, cells were grown in 10-cm culture
dishes and treated with 15 Ag/mL Con A for 72 h. The cells were fixed in
70% ethanol and labeled with fluorescein-tagged bromo-dUTP and
propidium iodide as per manufacturer’s protocol using APO-bromodeoxyuridine apoptosis kit (Phoenix Flow Systems).
RNA isolation and real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the
cells by using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Amplification of the corresponding gene was done using primer
sets supplied by Applied Biosystems, Inc. The data were analyzed for fold
induction of each gene compared with the untreated sample.
Western blot analyses. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were done as
described elsewhere (7). Briefly, total cellular proteins were isolated by
lysing the cells in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% (w/v) SDS, 2 mmol/L
benzamidine, and 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein
concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad).
Proteins were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and then
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was
blocked in 5% nonfat skimmed milk and incubated with the respective
antibody followed by the incubation with a secondary antibody. Proteins
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) as directed by the manufacturer.

Results
Con A treatment selectively induces apoptosis in cells
lacking p53. To identify compounds that exhibit differential
effects on cellular growth in the presence or absence of p53, we
made use of an isogenic pair of human fibroblasts, p53-null
MDAH041 (041), its derivative, TR9-7–expressing p53 (10), and
ovarian cancer cell SKOV3 that lacks p53. After a long screening
process, Con A was found to exhibit profound differential apoptosis
in cells lacking p53. 041 and SKOV3 cells became rounded and
detached, whereas a large population of TR9-7 cells remained
adhered with normal morphology. Methylene blue staining of the

Figure 1. Con A induces apoptosis of cells lacking p53. A, cells were treated with 15 Ag/mL Con A for 72 h and stained with methylene blue. B, cells were
treated with 15 Ag/mL Con A for 7 d. The adhered cells were trypsinized and 500 live cells were plated in 15-cm culture plates in the absence of Con A. After
3 wks, the colonies formed in each plate were counted after methylene blue staining. Results are expressed as percentage of untreated cells. C, 041, TR9-7, and BJ
cells (normal human fibroblast) and SKOV3 cells were treated with 15 Ag/mL Con A for 72 h. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained for TUNEL-positive
cells. D, cells were treated with 15 Ag/mL Con A for 24 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting for Bax, Bcl2, or PARP.

plates showed a profound differential growth regulation depending
on the p53 status (Fig. 1A). Next, a colony-forming assay was done
to determine whether the treated cells could resume growth. After
7 days of treatment with Con A, 500 live cells were plated onto a
15-cm plate in normal medium for 3 weeks. None of the Con A–
treated 041 cells formed colonies, whereas 97% of the treated TR9-7
cells did (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that Con A either
induces an irreversible growth arrest or kills cells lacking p53,
whereas cells expressing p53 are reversibly arrested and remain
alive. To investigate the mode of cell death, we did terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay. Following treatment with Con A, the great majority
of 041 and SKOV3 cells were TUNEL positive (Fig. 1C). In contrast,
only a small percentage of TR9-7 cells or normal human fibroblasts
(BJ) were TUNEL positive. These observations suggest that Con A–
induced cell death is mediated via apoptosis, which is most
prevalent in cells lacking p53. To determine whether the differential
apoptosis was specific for Con A, we treated 041 and TR9-7 cells
with the DNA-damaging agent, camptothecin, for 72 h and stained
the plates with methylene blue or did TUNEL assay. Interestingly,
both 041 and TR9-7 cells were equally sensitive to camptothecin
(data not shown).
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation and modulation
of Bax/Bcl2 ratio in favor of apoptosis. To investigate the
mechanism of Con A–induced apoptosis, we next examined the
expression of proapoptotic protein Bax and antiapoptotic protein
Bcl2 and the degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). Western blot analysis, as shown in Fig. 1D, reveals that

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

degradation of PARP was observed only in 041 cells. The levels of
Bax increased much more in 041 cells than in TR9-7 cells.
Furthermore, Bcl2 expression levels were drastically decreased
only in 041 cells. Thus, Con A treatment modulated the Bax/Bcl2
ratio in favor of apoptosis much more in 041 cells than in TR9-7
cells.
Con A–induced apoptosis is mediated via p73 in cells
lacking p53. To investigate the mechanism of apoptosis in cells
lacking p53, we analyzed the expression of p73, a member of the
p53 family of transcription factors. Western blot analysis and realtime PCR, as shown in Fig. 2A, reveals that Con A treatment
induced the expression of p73 in both 041 and SKOV3 cells. To
further implicate the role of p73 in Con A–induced apoptosis, p73
was functionally inactivated by using a dominant-negative mutant
of p73 (11). 041 cells were transfected with a T7-tagged DNp73. Two
independent clones C12 and C17 expressing DNp73 were
established (Fig. 2B). Con A–treated cells from these two clones
were stained for TUNEL to measure apoptosis and lysates were
analyzed by Western blot for the expression of Bax and Bcl2. As
shown in Fig. 2B and C, expression of dominant-negative p73
rendered resistance to Con A–induced apoptosis as revealed by
decrease in TUNEL-positive cells and reversal of the expression of
both Bax and Bcl2 proteins compared with that in parental 041
cells. Real-time PCR analysis also showed that the expression of
p21 and Bax is p73 dependent (Fig. 2D). These data together
indicate that p73 protein mediates apoptosis in response to Con A
treatment and that the expression of some of the p53 target genes
is regulated by p73 in the absence of p53.

p73-dependent expression of Foxo1a and Bim. To identify
molecular components involved in Con A–induced apoptosis, we
did microarray analysis. Total RNA from 041 cells either untreated
or Con A treated were isolated and hybridized with a chip
containing f26,000 transcripts from human origin. Expression
pattern of a total of 1,151 genes was found to be modulated (2-fold
change). A careful analysis of the data revealed that the forkhead
transcription factor Foxo1a and its proapoptotic target Bim (also
known as Bcl2L11) were well induced after Con A treatment. We
further confirmed the microarray data by Western blot analysis. As
shown in Fig. 3A, Con A treatment induced a profound increase in
the level of both Foxo1a and Bim protein. Because both Foxo1a and
Bim are involved in apoptosis and Con A–induced apoptosis is
mediated via p73, we next examined the expression of Foxo1a and
Bim in cells expressing dominant-negative p73. As shown in Fig. 3B
and C, Con A treatment led to an increase in the expression of
Foxo1a and Bim at both mRNA and protein levels in parental 041
cells. In contrast, their expression levels were substantially
decreased in cells with inactivated p73. We also measured the
expression of Bim in these cells after treatment with a known DNAdamaging agent, camptothecin. Treatment with camptothecin also
substantially increased the expression of Bim. However, there was
no difference between the cell lines (data not shown). These results
suggest that expressions of both Foxo1a and Bim are regulated by
p73 in response to Con A.
p73-dependent inhibition of Akt activation is critical for
Con A–induced apoptosis. The serine/threonine kinase Akt plays
a pivotal role in the regulation of Foxo transcription factors, which
are the direct substrates for Akt (12). Because Con A treatment
induced the expression of Foxo1a and its target Bim, we next
examined the activation of Akt in 041 cells and its derivative clones
expressing DNp73. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was very little
phosphorylation of Akt in 041 cells. In contrast, Con A–mediated
phosphorylation of Akt was greatly induced in the same very cells
but expressing DNp73. These results suggest that activation of p73

by Con A inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt. To further confirm
the role of p73-dependent inhibition of Akt activation in Con A–
induced apoptosis, cells expressing DNp73 (C17) were pretreated
with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002,
followed by treatment with Con A. As shown in Fig. 4B and C,
pretreatment with LY294002 completely inhibited Akt activation
and sensitized cells to Con A–induced apoptosis. These results
suggest that p73-dependent inhibition of Akt activation is
important for Con A–induced apoptosis.

Discussion
A great majority of human cancers either lack p53 or retain a
mutant p53 that is functionally inactive. An ideal compound for
cancer chemotherapy would posses the ability to activate apoptotic
pathways in tumor cells lacking p53 and simultaneously protect
normal cells retaining p53. In the present study, we find that Con A
possesses such properties. Cells lacking functional p53 undergo
apoptosis. In contrast, the same cells expressing p53, as well as
normal human fibroblasts, are much less sensitive to Con A and
resumed growth upon return to their normal conditions. In the
present report, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of
apoptosis in response to Con A in the absence of p53. Unlike p53,
its family member p73 is frequently functional and is overexpressed
in some tumors (13). Therefore, p73 is now regarded as an
important determinant of cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs,
particularly in tumors lacking functional p53 (reviewed in refs. 3
and 14). These findings have aroused interest in searching for
compounds that can activate p73 and induce p73-dependent
apoptosis of cancer cells lacking functional p53. We found for the
first time that Con A–induced apoptosis is p73 dependent because
inhibition of p73 function by a dominant-negative construct almost
completely reversed the Con A response. Our observations show
that Con A induces p73, which in turn modulates the Bax/Bcl2
ratio such that it is more favorable to apoptosis. Many reports

The Akt serine/threonine kinases are critical mediators of cell
survival in response to many extracellular stimuli. It is now clear
that the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathways and the resulting
inhibition of apoptosis are critical events in tumorigenesis. Several
Akt downstream targets are important for the survival role of Akt,
including Foxo1a, Bad, MDM2, p21, etc. (18). Our results suggest
that activation of p73 inhibits the activation of Akt following Con A
treatment, which was rescued after disruption of p73 activation
and which mediates the apoptosis in cells lacking p53. To our
knowledge, this is the first report that describes p73-dependent
inhibition of Akt activation to mediate apoptosis. The Foxo
transcription factors, including Foxo1a, are direct substrates for
Akt. Phosphorylation of Foxo1a by Akt exports it from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting Foxo1a-induced target gene
expression and apoptosis (12). There is insignificant activation of
Akt in 041 cells; thus, Foxo1a remains fully active and induced
plenty of Bim to execute apoptosis. In contrast, rescue of Akt
phosphorylation in cells with disrupted p73 activation might
inactive Foxo1a by exporting it from the nucleus in addition to
inhibition of Foxo1a transcripts, thus inhibiting Bim expression
and complete reversion of apoptosis.
The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is a bonafide
target of p53 family members and is involved in both G1 and G2-M
arrest to allow time to repair any sort of genomic damage
caused by genotoxic stress. Consistent with the study by
Desrivieres et al. (19), we also found that Con A treatment
induced both G2-M and G1 cell cycle arrest (data not shown).
However, this is the first report to show that Con A induced p21,
which is mostly dependent on p73. A recent study by Huang
et al. (20) suggests that CDK2 phosphorylates Foxo1a and
Figure 3. p73-dependent expression of Foxo1a and Bim. A, 041 cells were
treated with Con A for the times indicated and total cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blotting using antibodies that detect Foxo1a and Bim. B, 041 and
its derived cells expressing DNp73 were treated with Con A for times indicated

Bim antibodies. C, cells were treated with Con A for 24 h and total RNA was

suggest that activation of p73 is dependent on E2F1. In contrast,
we observed recently that the induction of p73 is dependent
on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in response to
( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (15). However, we found that the
expression of E2F1 was drastically decreased in 041 and its
derivative clones, but ROS generation was substantially increased
after Con A treatment (data not shown). These results suggest that
Con A–induced expression of p73 is independent on E2F1 but
might be regulated by ROS.
The Foxo family of transcription factors, including Foxo1a and
Foxo3a, are emerging as key regulators for cell survival and
apoptosis. Activation of Foxo induces apoptosis by up-regulating
several cell death genes, including those encoding the ligand for the
death receptor known as Fas or CD95, the Bcl2-interacting
mediator (Bim) of cell death, and the tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis-inducing ligand (12, 16, 17). However, the
mechanism of induction of Foxo is largely unknown. In the present
study, we for the first time showed that the plant lectin Con A
induced the expression of both Foxo1a and its proapoptotic target
Bim at the transcriptional and protein levels in cells undergoing
apoptosis. Moreover, our results also revealed for the first time that
p73 plays a critical role in the regulation of these genes.

renders it transcriptionally inactive. Activation of checkpoint
pathways on DNA damage abrogated this phosphorylation of
Foxo1a to execute apoptosis. Because p21 is an inhibitor of
CDK2, expression of p21 by Con A treatment might also
cooperate to transactivate Foxo1a to induce apoptosis. In
conclusion, our study suggests a novel role for p73 in the
regulation of Akt-Foxo1a-Bim signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, these cell culture studies also suggest that Con A exhibits
properties that would make a logical sense for a chemotherapeutic agent: to be able to trigger apoptosis in cells lacking
