ABSTRACT
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a well-defined aggressive Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma
with short survival rates and remains incurable to date. Previously, we demonstrated
the antitumor activity of ZGDHu-1(N, N’-di-(m-methylphenyi)-3, 6-dimethyl-1,
4-dihydro-1, 2, 4, 5-tetrazine-1, 4-dicarboamide) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
In this study, ZGDHu-1 shows potent anti-lymphoma activity in MCL cells. ZGDHu-1
significantly induces cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in MCL cells. ZGDHu-1
reduces the protein levels of Mcl-1, Bcl-XL and cyclin D1. Importantly, ZGDHu-1
inhibits TNFα-induced IkBa phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB
downstream target gene expression in MCL cells. MCL samples expressing high levels
of Bcl-2 and high Bcl-2/Bax ratios tend to be less effective to ZGDHu-1. Together,
these results suggest that ZGDHu-1 could inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway partly,
which may lead to the suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis
in MCL cells. Thus, our studies provide evidence of the potential of ZGDHu-1 in treating
mantle cell lymphoma.

NF-κB and regulates the G1-S transition of the cell cycle
[9]. Though cyclin D1 overexpression has become the
hallmark of MCL, it is not sufficient for the development
of MCL. Accumulating evidence suggests that MCL is
often detrimental to other cellular processes, such as the
apoptosis and DNA repair. Apoptosis plays an important
role in cancer development. MCL cells evade apoptosis
by up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
[9]. We know that NF-κB activation plays a critical role
in MCL cell survival and leads to the overexpression of
several anti-apoptotic molecules [9–13]. Among these,
anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family appears to
be particularly important in the the development of MCL
[10]. Inhibiting NF-κB activation has been shown to
induce cell-cycle arrest and cell death in MCL cells [11–
13]. Therefore, the NF-κB pathway is an attractive target
for therapeutic intervention in the onset and progression
of MCL.

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a highly aggressive
form of Non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (NHL) with a median
survival of approximately 5 years and accounts for 6-8%
of NHL [1–3]. Although some patients exhibit clinically
indolent progression, MCL is generally aggressive, with
most patients in stage III or IV at diagnosis [3]. Although
conventional chemotherapy results in an overall 60-80%
response, most patients relapse and succumb to MCL
[4]. Patient responses to currently available therapies,
including monoclonal antibody therapy and high-dose
chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation,
have been limited [5–8]. Thus far, no therapy has been
sufficiently effective in extending the overall survival time
of patients with MCL. Therefore, novel treatments that
maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize toxicities are
desperately needed.
MCL is characterized by chromosomal translocation

4-dicarboamide] (Figure 1A), a tetrazine compound,
synthesized by Wei-Xiao Hu (Pharmaceutical College of
Zhejiang University of Technology, China) [14], possesses
anti-tumor activity [15, 16] and has been identified as a
potential proteasome inhibitor [17]. The effects of this
novel ZGDHu-1 and its molecular mechanism(s) against
MCL have not yet been investigated. We hypothesized that
ZGDHu-1 exerts anti-lymphoma activity in MCL cells by
inducing apoptosis via a mechanism that likely involves
NF-κB regulation.
In this study, we screened 17 primary MCL patients
and three different MCL cell lines to investigate the antilymphoma activity of ZGDHu-1. Primary MCL cells from
two MCL patients (MCL #3 and MCL #12) and three
MCL cell lines were further examined to study ZGDHu1’s molecular mechanism. We found that ZGDHu-1
exerted cytotoxic activity and significantly induced cell
cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in MCL cells.
We also demonstrated that ZGDHu-1 decreased IkBa
phosphorylation and reduced the expression of Mcl-1, BclXL and cyclin D1 and blocked the TNFα-induced NF-κB
signaling pathway in MCL cells. These findings suggest
that ZGDHu-1 induces apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-κB
signaling pathway in MCL cells partly, thereby providing
evidence that ZGDHu-1 is a potential therapeutic molecule
that may improve MCL patients’ outcomes.

ZGDHu-1 is identified as a potent cytocoxic
compound in MCL cells
To determine the sensitivity of MCL cells to
ZGDHu-1, three MCL cell lines (Rec-1, Jeko-1,
MAVER-1) were treated with increasing doses of
ZGDHu-1 for 72 hours. As shown in Table 1, the efficacy
of ZGDHu-1 was heterogeneous on different MCL
cell lines. Indeed, Rec-1 (the half maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) 187.6 ng/ml), Jeko-1 cells (IC50
213.4 ng/ml) were found to be highly sensitiver to
ZGDHu-1 than MAVER-1 cells (IC50 358.9 ng/ml)
(Figure 1C). We next investigated ZGDHu-1 sensitivity
in 6 primary MCL cells obtained randomly from
peripheral blood of 17 patients. The same as MCL cell
lines, ZGDHu-1 induced cell death in 6 all samples.
Five primary cells reduced the viabilities of MCL cells
(IC 50 224.9 ng/ml for MCL #1, IC 50 187.9 ng/ml for
MCL #3, IC 50 289.6 ng/ml for MCL #4, IC 50 247.9 ng/
ml for MCL #5, IC 50 257.1 ng/ml for MCL #6) (Figure
1C and Supplementary Figure 1A-1B). However, MCL
#2 primary MCL cells were apparently insensitive to
ZGDHu-1(IC50 809.1 ng/ml). So we evaluated the effects
of ZGDHu-1(100 - 400 ng/ml, 48 h) on the viabilities

of 17 primary MCL cells using PI stainning. ZGDHu-1
reduced the viabilities of primary MCL cells in a timedependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1B) and a
dose-depependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1C).
Most importantly, in our previous research, this inhibitive
effect of ZGDHu-1 was not observed in normal peripheral
B cells which were treated with ZGDHu-1 under the same
conditions [16], suggesting that the cytotoxic effects of
ZGDHu-1 on MCL cells are specific. Thus, for subsequent
studies, the treatment duration was set at 48 h for 100 ng/
ml and 200 ng/ml ZGDHu-1.

significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in
primary MCL cells and three MCL cell lines (Figure 2A–
2B and Supplementary Figure 2). The percentages of cells
in the G01 and S phase were not significantly changed. We
also showed that ZGDHu-1 increased the fraction of cells
in the sub-G1 phase (Figure 2A–2B and Supplementary
Figure 2). Together, these data suggested that ZGDHu-1
could induce cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis
in MCL cells.

ZGDHu-1 induces cell cycle G2/M phase arrest
in MCL cells

ZGDHu-1 dramatically decreased cell viability
within 48 h, suggesting that ZGDHu-1 mainly induces cell
death in addition to causing cell cycle arrest. We observed
that most ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/ml, 48 h) - treated
MCL cells presented typical morphological changes with
apoptosis, pyknosis (nucleus condensing) and karyorrhexis
(nucleus fragmenting) by Hoechst 33258 staining (Figure
3A). ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/ml, 48 h) significantly
induced Annexin V+ PI- apoptotic cells in primary MCL
cells and three MCL cell lines in dose-dependent manner

ZGDHu-1 induces apoptosis in MCL cells

Because ZGDHu-1 inhibits MCL cell proliferation,
it is likely that ZGDHu-1 causes MCL cell cycle arrest. To
test this hypothesis, we treated two random primary MCL
cells (MCL #3 and MCL #12) and three MCL cell lines
with ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/ml) for 48 h and measured
the cell cycle distribution. Indeed, following ZGDHu-1
treatment, the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase

(Figure 3B–3C and Supplementary Figure 3A). Moreover,
ZGDHu-1 induced the dissipation of ∆Ψm (Figure 3D–3E
and Supplementary Figure 3B), the cleavage of Caspase-3
(Figure 3F–3H and Supplementary Figure 3C) and PARP
(Figure 3H), which is a well-known caspase substrate,
in MCL cells. It appeared that the MCL cells underwent
apoptosis after ZGDHu-1 treatment.
To further confirm whether caspase-dependent
apoptosis plays a prominent role in ZGDHu-1-induced
apoptosis, we treated MCL cells with ZGDHu-1 in the
presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk (200
mM) and observed that ZGDHu-1-induced Annexin V+
PI- apoptosis, ZGDHu-1-induced caspase-3 activation
as well as the cleavage of PARP was largely abrogated
(Figure 3B–3C,Figure 3F–3H and Supplementary Figure
3A, 3C). But the adding of Z-VAD.fmk did not inhibit the
dissipation of ∆Ψm (Figure 3D–3E and Supplementary
Figure 3B). Together, these results strongly suggested that
ZGDHu-1 induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis of
MCL cells.

(Figure 5A). ZGDHu-1 decreased the Bcl-XL protein
levels in dose-dependent manners in MCL #12 primary
MCL cells (Figure 5A).
To confirm that the Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL protein loss
were due to decrease in the transcription level, Mcl-1
and Bcl-XL mRNA levels following ZGDHu-1 treatment
were measured using qRT-PCR and a-tubulin as a
control. ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/ml, 48 h) caused a rapid
reduction of Mcl-1 mRNA and Bcl-XL mRNA in Rec-1
(Figure 5B), Jeko-1 (Figure 5C), MAVER-1 (Figure 5D)
and 17 primary cells (Figure 5E). These results confirmed
that the losses of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL protein were due to
decrease on the transcription level.

ZGDHu-1 blocks TNFα-induced NF-κB
activation and the expression of
anti-apoptotic proteins
It is well known that the NF-κB signaling pathway
inhibits apoptosis by inducing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. NF-κB
is constitutively active and levels of nuclear p65 and
IkBa phosphorylation increase in MCL cells compared
to normal B cells [19–20]. Traditionally, NF-κB is
composed of two subunits and is normally sequestered
in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor protein, IκB [21]. NFκB activation can induce IκB phosphorylation in NFκB exposed cells, targeting them for rapid degradation
via a proteasome pathway, which releases NF-κB to
the nucleus, where it binds to specific sequences in
the promoter regions of genes [22]. To investigate
the mechanism by which ZGDHu-1 inhibits the
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, we tested whether
ZGDHu-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway.
Initially, we examined the effect of ZGDHu-1 on IkBa
phosphorylation, a major target molecule of the NF-κB
signaling pathway. The results indicated significant dosedependent down-regulation of IkBα phosphorylation and
nuclear p65 following ZGDHu-1 treatment in primary
MCL cells and three MCL cell lines (Figure 5A). But
ZGDHu-1 did not change the protein levels of Bcl-2,
Bax and cytoplasmic p65 of primary MCL cells and three
MCL cell lines (Figure 5A).
We further evaluated whether ZGDHu-1 inhibited
TNFα-induced p65 nuclear translocation in three MCL
cell lines. As expected, TNFα (10 ng/ml) activated the NFκB signaling pathway in three MCL cell lines, as indicated
by the phosphorylation of IkBa, the degradation of IkBa
and the induction of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL in Rec-1 (Figure
6A), Jeko-1 (Figure 6B) and MAVER-1 (Figure 6C).
ZGDHu-1 (200 ng/ml, 24 h) almost completely blocked
the phosphorylation of IkBa, the degradation of IkBa
and the induction of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL proteins in Rec-1
(Figure 6A), Jeko-1 (Figure 6B). ZGDHu-1 did not affect
the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and p65 in three MCL cell
lines (Figure 6A–6C).

ZGDHu-1 induces changes in ROS in MCL cells
Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a
key role in apoptosis, we used DHR staining and flow
cytometry to examine whether ROS levels were affected
by ZGDHu-1 in MCL cells. ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/
ml, 48 h) significantly induced ROS generation of MCL
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A–4B). We
also tested whether the ROS scavenger glutathione (GSH)
could suppress ZGDHu-1-induced apoptosis in primary
MCL cells and three MCL cell lines. Pretreatment with
GSH (100 μM) for 2 h could significantly block ZGDHu1-induced ROS generation (Figure 4A–4B), and partly
inhibited the pro-apoptotic effect of ZGDHu-1 on
MCL cells (Figure 4C–4D) and ZGDHu-1-induced the
dissipation of ∆Ψm in MCL cells (Figure 4E). Taken
together, these results suggested that ZGDHu-1 can
promote apoptosis of MCL cells by inducing ROS
generation.

ZGDHu-1 decreases the expression levels of
multiple cell cycle and apoptosis regulators
in MCL cells
Because ZGDHu-1 induced cell cycle G2/M phase
arrest and apoptosis, we examined the protein levels of
several cell cycle and apoptosis regulators to investigate
the apoptosis mechanism triggered by ZGDHu-1 in MCL
cells. In primary MCL cells and three MCL cell lines,
ZGDHu-1 (100 - 200 ng/ml, 48 h) decreased the protein
levels of cyclin D1, but not cyclin B1, cyclin E and
CDK2, in dose-dependent manners (Figure 5A). Likewise,
ZGDHu-1 decreased the protein levels of Mcl-1 and BclXL, but not Bcl-2 and Bax, in dose-dependent manners
in MCL #3 primary MCL cells and three MCL cell lines

P65 nuclear translocation is a symbol for NF-κB
activation [21]. We further used western blot analysis to
evaluate whether ZGDHu-1 inhibits TNFα-induced p65
nuclear translocation in MCL cells. As indicated in Figure
6D, ZGDHu-1 significantly inhibited TNFα-induced
p65 nuclear translocation at 60 to 120 min in three MCL
cell lines. Overall, these results suggest that ZGDHu-1
suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis by inhibiting
the NF-κB signaling pathway in MCL cells.

less effective in Bcl-2high primary MCL cells. However,
no significant association was observed between Mcl1 mRNA levels (Figure 7B), Bax mRNA levels (Figure
7D), Bcl-XL mRNA levels (Figure 7E) and ZGDHu-1
sensitivity.
As we observed that high levels of Bcl-2 conferred
less effective to ZGDHu-1, we postulated whether
ZGDHu-1 could less effective in Bcl-2high MCL cell lines.
To prove our surmise, we treated the representative Bcl2high cell line MAVER-1 and Bcl-2low cell line REC-1 with
ZGDHu-1 (Table 2). As expected, the results indicated
Bcl-2low cell line REC-1 was sensitizer to ZGDHu-1 than
Bcl-2high cell line MAVER-1 (Figure 1C and Figure 3C,
3E, 3G).

Bcl-2 expression confers resistance to ZGDHu-1
We know Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and Bax play
controlling roles in the survival of MCL cells [23]. Our
results indicated that ZGDHu-1 reduced Mcl-1 and
Bcl-XL protein levels in primary MCL cells. Next, we
evaluated putative differences in the basal mRNA relative
levels of these proteins in correlation with sensitivity to
ZGDHu-1 in primary MCL cells (Table 1, Figure 7A).
Interestingly, we observed that Bcl-2 mRNA levels and
Bcl-2/Bax ratios were inversely correlated with ZGDHu-1
sensitivity (Figure 7C, 7F), thus indicating ZGDHu-1

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that ZGDHu-1 showed great
cytotoxicity in 17 primary MCL cells and three different
MCL cell lines and identified ZGDHu-1 as a potent antilymphoma compound to MCL. Some differences in

sensitivity to ZGDHu-1 were observed among primary
MCL cells, but not in B cells from healthy donors [16].
ZGDHu-1 inhibited MCL cell proliferation by decreasing
the protein levels of cyclin D1 and inducing cell cycle
G2/M phase arrest. More importantly, ZGDHu-1 induced
apoptosis of MCL cells by decreasing the anti-apoptotic
protein levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL. We demonstrated that
ZGDHu-1 inhibited the activation of the TNFα-induced
NF-κB signaling pathway and the induction of these antiapoptotic proteins.
The intracellular redox status, which depends on
both the GSH levels and ROS generation, is important in
stabilizing mitochondrial functions. The mitochondrial
dysfunction associated with ROS induced the activation
of pro-apoptotic proteins, then led to caspase-dependent
or caspase-independent apoptosis [24]. ZGDHu-1
significantly induced ROS generation of MCL cells and
GSH could suppress ZGDHu-1-induced apoptosis in MCL

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells. These results suggested ZGDHu-1 could regulate
mitochondria by elevating the ROS levels and affecting
the intracellular redox status. Furthermore, our data also
showed that ZGDHu-1 decrease the ∆Ψm, induced the
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in MCL cells. Taken
together, these findings showed that ZGDHu-1 ultimately
activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and
caused caspase-dependent apoptosis in MCL cells, which
consistent with previous reports [16, 25].
Cyclins and the CDK family play important roles
in cell-cycle regulation and cell replication. Coupled
with CDK, cyclin D1 regulates the G1-S transition of
the cell cycle and is involved in the regulation of MCL
cell proliferation. In this study, our results show that
ZGDHu-1 significantly decreased cyclin D1 protein levels
and induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest in MCL cells.
The suppression of cyclin D1 by ZGDHu-1 resulted in the
suppression of MCL cell proliferation. Because NF-κB is

well known to mediate antiapoptotic effects, elicits cellcycle arrest and contributes to the stabilities of cyclin D1
in MCL cells [9], we examined whether suppression of
NF-κB by ZGDHu-1 could lead to apoptosis.
To further elucidate the mechanism of ZGDHu1-induced apoptosis in MCL cells, we investigated the
important apoptotic regulators which are known to be
regulated by NF-κB [26–27]. NF-κB activity is commonly
elevated in CLL [28], MCL [9, 29], and other solid tumors
[30]. The activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway is
appreciated as a key mechanism for cell proliferation
[31–32] and apoptosis [33–34]. We demonstrated that
ZGDHu-1 inhibited the TNFα-induced expression of BclXL and Mcl-1, IκBa phosphorylation and nuclear p65
levels. In the absence of exogenous TNFα, ZGDHu-1 in
MCL cells also inhibited IκBa phosphorylation and nuclear
p65 levels and ultimately suppressed the expression of
proliferation (cyclin D1) and survival (Bcl-xL, Mcl1) molecules. These findings suggested that ZGDHu-1
induced apoptosis most likely through the inhibition of
NF-κB signaling pathway in MCL cells.
Our results indicated that ZGDHu-1 induced
cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and caused caspasedependent apoptosis in MCL cells, in consistent with
similar experiments performed with CLL cells [16]. In
CLL, ZGDHu-1-induced apoptosis is promoted by antiapoptotic Bcl-2. Herein, we noticed that Bcl-2 was highly
constitutively expressed in MCL patients, in accordance
with other studies [35]. However, we did not observe
Bcl-2 down-regulation in primary MCL cells following
ZGDHu-1 treatment, suggesting a distinct mechanism for
apoptosis induction in MCL cells. In this study, Mcl-1 and
Bcl-XL reductions caused by ZGDHu-1 may account for
the observed apoptosis. Nevertheless, although similar
reductions in Mcl-1 mRNA levels were observed among
all primary MCL cases, a variable degree of cytotoxic
response to ZGDHu-1 could be found, suggesting that
other mechanisms may be involved in ZGDHu-1-induced
apoptosis of MCL cells. Remarkably, we found that high
Bcl-2 expression levels and Bcl-2/Bax ratios correlated
to reduced responses to ZGDHu-1 in primary MCL cells.
Furthermore, Next we continue to study whether the
targeting Bcl-2 can improve the sensitivity of ZGDHu-1
in Bcl-2high MCL cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, this is the first report evaluating the
effects of a novel tetrazine compound ZGDHu-1 on MCL.
Our results show that ZGDHu-1 can potently inhibit cell
proliferation and induce apoptosis in MCL cells through
the inhibition of NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic genes
expression in vitro. In addition, results show the antilymphoma activity of ZGDHu-1 in MCL cells was
on the targeting NF-κB pathway. Our research thus
provides evidence and rationale regarding the potentially
therapeutic effects of ZGDHu-1 and the possibility that
treatment with this molecule may improve the outcomes
of MCL patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Seventeen MCL patients (12 males and 5 females)
aged 59-83 years (with a median age of 73 years) were
enrolled in this study. The biological characteristics of
these cases are shown in Table 1. Patients with MCL were
identified on the basis of morphologic, immunophenotypic,
and molecular criteria according to World Health
Organization (WHO) lymphoma classification. Only
those patients who had not received previous treatments
within the last 6 months were included in the study. All 17
patients were collected prior to the commencement of any
treatment. Age-matched controls were obtained from 10
healthy donors. Ethical approval for this project, including
informed consent from patients, was granted based on the
guidelines of the Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital
research ethics committee.

Cell lines and cell culture
Three human MCL cell lines (MAVER-1, Jeko1 and Rec-1) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Jeko-1 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
20% FBS, 20 U/ml penicillin, and 20 U/ml streptomycin.
MAVER-1 and Rec-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 U/ml penicillin,
and 20 U/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37
°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.

Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckman Coulter
NAVIOS FACS (Miami, FL, USA).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined as described using
PI stainning and flow cytometer [18]. The effects of
ZGDHu-1 on the viability of MCL cells were assayed
using MTT assay. The optical density was measured using
a microplate reader M680 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
and reference and test wavelengths of 630 nm and 570 nm,
respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated at least three times. The cell viability was
expressed as a percentage of the DMSO-treated control
samples.

FACS
Primary MCL cells were stained with anti-CD19PerCP CY 5.5 and anti-active caspase-3-PE. The stained
cells were analyzed using NAVIOS FACS. Then, 10,000
cells were counted for each sample and CD19+ cell
population was gated for analysis as follows. The effects
of ZGDHu-1 on apoptosis in MCL cells were evaluated
via annexin V/PI assay, mitochondrial membrane
potentials (ΔΨm), active caspase-3 and cell cycle analysis.
The annexin V/PI assay was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, and only annexin V-positive
(+) and PI-negative (-) cells were defined as apoptotic.
ΔΨm was measured using JC-1 dye. The intracellular
accumulation of ROS was assessed using DHR fluorescent
dye. The percentage of active caspase-3-positive cells was
calculated using NAVIOS FACS.

Lymphocyte purification and culture
Primary MCL cells were obtained from peripheral
blood samples of MCL patients who were diagnosed
according to the WHO criteria. Lymphocytes were
isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 1 h of
incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2, adhesive mononuclear cells
were removed. T lymphocytes were removed using antiCD3 dynabeads (Dynal, Merseyside, UK). Purification
of B lymphocytes was assessed by flow cytometry with
anti-CD19 antibodies. This cell preparation contained
approximately 95% CD19 positive cells (Figure 1B).

alterations in the cell cycles of MCL cells. After the
designated treatments, MCL cells were harvested and
washed with PBS solution. 500 μl of DNA Prep LPR
was added, and after 8 s, 500 μl of DNA Prep stain was
added and then remained for 15 min at room temperature.
Finally, the cells were analyzed by NAVIOS FACS, and
the fractions of the cell population in the G1/G0 (G01),
S, and G2/M phases were quantified via Wincycle 32
software. The sub-G1 fraction was determined from the
total event count.
