Abstract
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during
embryonic development and may also be associated with
the metastatic spread of epithelial tumors. During EMT,
E-cadherin is down-regulated and this correlates with
increased motility and invasion of cells. We show that
differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells in
monolayer culture is associated with an E- to N-cadherin
switch, increased vimentin expression, up-regulation of
E-cadherin repressor molecules (Snail and Slug proteins),
and increased gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinases; MMP-2
and MMP-9) activity and cellular motility, all characteristic
EMT events. The 5T4 oncofetal antigen, previously shown to be
associated with early human ES cell differentiation, is also
part of this process. Abrogation of E-cadherin–mediated cellcell contact in undifferentiated ES cells using neutralizing
antibody (nAb) SHE78.7 resulted in increased cellular motility,
altered actin cytoskeleton arrangement and a mesenchymal
phenotype together with presentation of the 5T4 antigen
at the cell surface. nAb-treated ES cells remained in an
undifferentiated state, as assessed by OCT-4 protein expression, and did not express EMT-associated transcripts. Removal
of nAb from ES cells resulted in the restoration of cell-cell
contact, absence of cell surface 5T4, decreased mesenchymal
cellular morphology and motility, and enabled the differentiation of the cells to the three germ layers upon their removal
from the fibroblast feeder layer. We conclude that E-cadherin
functions in human ES cells to stabilize the cortical actin
cyoskeletal arrangement and this prevents cell surface
localization of the 5T4 antigen. Furthermore, human ES cells
represent a useful model system with which to study EMT
events relevant to embryonic development and tumor cell
metastasis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(23):11254–62]

Introduction
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during normal
embryo development and might also be associated with tumor cell
invasion and metastasis (1–3). A defining characteristic of EMT is
the loss of cadherin-1 (E-cadherin)–mediated cell-cell contacts and
the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype (1, 4). During mouse
embryonic development, EMT is required for epiblast cells to

facilitate their ingression within the primitive streak, with loss of
cell surface E-cadherin and gain of cadherin-2 (N-cadherin)
observed in this process (1, 5). Similarly, metastasis of primary
epithelial tumor cells, which is the main cause of death in cancer
patients, is associated with loss of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell
contacts and gain of a mesenchymal phenotype, potentially
facilitating cellular motility and invasion (1, 6–9). The role of
E-cadherin as a metastasis repressor is well established (1, 3).
For example, loss of E-cadherin in epithelial cells leads to the
abrogation of cell-cell contact and increased motility (3, 10), with
forced expression of wild-type E-cadherin protein in carcinoma cell
lines sufficient for reversal of this phenotype (1, 3, 4, 11). In contrast
to other tumor suppressors (e.g., p53), E-cadherin is rarely mutated
in carcinomas (1, 12) and transcriptional inactivation of E-cadherin
by E-box binding proteins (e.g., Snail and Slug) correlates with
tumor cell metastasis (3, 13, 14). However, E-cadherin can also be
regulated at the protein level, including proteolytic degradation of
the cell surface protein (15) or its internalization via the c-met
receptor pathway (16–18).
Although loss of cell surface E-cadherin is considered a
prerequisite for EMT, many other cellular events are required to
impart increased cellular motility and invasion. For example,
altered matrix recognition and adhesion, up-regulation of promigratory molecules, and expression of extracellular proteases are
critical components of EMT (1). Regulation of cell matrix
recognition and adhesion is partly governed by the selection of
proteins displayed at the plasma membrane (1). For example,
N-cadherin is up-regulated on breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid,
and squamous cell carcinomas and imparts migration and invasion
of the cells (19). The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, in
particular MMP-2 and MMP-9, are known to influence invasion
during development and metastasis (20–24). MMP family proteins
degrade extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins, leading to
the release of stored promigratory factors which aids the migration
and invasion of cells within tissues. Thus, EMT is a complex event
requiring the correct spatiotemporal expression, interaction, and
modification of a range of cellular and extracellular factors to allow
cellular motility and invasion to proceed.
Snail genes are associated with all EMT processes studied to
date (25, 26) and they function by binding to the E-cadherin
promoter leading to the repression of gene transcripts (1, 13, 27).
However, Snail family members also function as potent survival
factors (26), for example, both Snail and Slug can induce cell
survival in the absence of EMT (26). In addition, it has been shown
that Slug expression is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in mesotheliomas and could induce cell survival in
leukemias. Slug, Snail, and SIP1 (another E-box binding protein) are
also associated with the ingression of epiblast cells within the
primitive streak during early development (28–30). Similarly, Slug

protein expression is associated with chick epiblast ingression and
its expression in neural crest cells is associated with their
emergence from the neural tube (29). Slug is likely to be a key
regulator of EMT in the developing embryo because its repression
can block both the emergence of mesoderm from the primitive
streak and EMT within the neural crest (29, 30).
Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the
inner cell mass/epiblast of preimplantation embryos (31–33). ES
cells can be cultured in an undifferentiated state over extended
passages in vitro and can be induced to differentiate into the three
primary germ layers in vitro and in vivo (31–33). We have
previously shown that spontaneous differentiation of mouse and
human ES cells is associated with cell surface expression of the 5T4
oncofetal antigen (34, 35). The 5T4 antigen is a glycoprotein upregulated in colorectal, gastric, and ovarian carcinomas and this
expression correlates with poorer clinical outcome in these
patients (36–39). Moreover, forced expression of h5T4 in mouse
ES cells leads to loss of cell-cell contacts and, in epithelial cells,
membranous E-cadherin is down-regulated and associated with
alterations in the actin cytoskeleton (34, 40). Therefore, we
hypothesized that upon ES cell differentiation, mechanisms
associated with altered cellular motility and invasion would occur,
with loss of E-cadherin critical for this event.

Materials and Methods
Human ES cell culture and differentiation. HES4 hES cells (31) were
cultured as previously described (35). The medium was changed daily. Cells
were passaged after 7 to 10 days by gently cutting and teasing the
morphologically undifferentiated cells using a yellow pipette tip and
transferring colony pieces to a fresh culture dish. For differentiation studies,
colony pieces were transferred to gelatin-treated organ culture dishes in the
absence of a fibroblast feeder layer in ES cell medium unless otherwise
stated.
Antibody-induced loss of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contacts.
E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contacts were abrogated by culture of HES4
ES cells in 2 Ag/mL of mouse anti–E-cadherin SHE78.7 antibody (Invitrogen
Corporation) for 24 h prior to experimental analysis. Mouse IgG2a antibody
was used as a control in all experiments (Invitrogen Corporation).
Immunofluorescent imaging of ES cells. Human ES cells were cultured
on Nunc plastic slide flask chambers (Nalge, Nunc International) coated
with feeders and grown for various times. Cells were prepared as previously
described (35). Primary antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-human
5T4 (1 Ag/mL; ref. 41); rabbit anti-OCT-4 (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); mouse anti-human E-cadherin (clone SHE78.7; 1:100
dilution; Invitrogen), rabbit anti–N-cadherin (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); goat anti-Slug (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
rabbit anti-Snail (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-E12/
E47 (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Actin cytoskeleton was
detected using phalloidin-Texas red conjugate (1:1,000 dilution; Sigma).
The cells were viewed on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope and/or
a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Images were overlaid using
Adobe Photoshop version 6.0 where described.
Fluorescent flow cytometry analysis of ES cells. Human ES cells were
treated with dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed once in 900 AL of PBS
and resuspended in 100 AL of 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS
( fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer) containing the primary antibody.
Primary antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-human E-cadherin (1:100
dilution; Invitrogen); rabbit anti–N-cadherin (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), mouse anti-human 5T4 (1 Ag/mL; ref. 41) and incubated for
1 h on ice. Cells were washed once in 900 AL of PBS, resuspended in 100 AL
of fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer containing appropriate
phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (all 1:100 dilution; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were
washed once in 900 AL of PBS and fixed in 400 AL of 1% formaldehyde. Cell

fluorescence was analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur. Viable
cells were gated using forward and side scatter and the data represent cells
from this population.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells using
RNAzol B according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Biogenesis) and
synthesis of cDNA from mRNA was performed as previously described (34).
Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using 1 AL of the cDNA
solution for 45 cycles. Samples were run on 2% agarose gels containing 400
ng/mL of ethidium bromide and visualized using an Epi Chemi II Darkroom
and Sensicam imager with Labworks 4 software (UVP). Primers used were as

Western blotting. Cells were trypsinized, washed twice in PBS and
resuspended in lysis buffer (2  107 cells/mL in 0.5 mol/L Tris, 1.5 mol/L
NaCl, 0.5% v/v NP40, and 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice
for 20 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as previously
described (42). Primary antibodies were as follows: rat anti-mouse Ecadherin (1:200 dilution, DECMA-1; Sigma), anti–N-cadherin (1:200
dilution), anti-Slug (1:200 dilution), anti-Snail (1:200 dilution), and antiE2A (1:200 dilution; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane
was probed using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated immunoglobulins
(DAKO) as described previously (42). Western blot images were captured
using an Epi Chemi II Darkroom and Sensicam imager with Labworks
4 software (UVP).
Zymogram analysis. HES4 human ES cells were cultured in synthetic
serum-containing medium in the presence of an irradiated fibroblast feeder
layer (undifferentiated) or differentiated in the absence of a feeder layer on
gelatin-treated plates for various times in ES cell medium or N2B27 medium
(43). Protease activity was determined using a precast 10% gelatin gel
(Bio-Rad) and visualized according to the manufacturer’s instructions as
previously described (42). Images were captured using an Epi Chemi II
Darkroom and Sensicam imager with Labworks 4 software (UVP).
Cell motility assay. Costar Transwell 24-well plates exhibiting 5-Am
pore size were used for all motility assays. The transwells were immersed
overnight in gelatin solution (0.1% in PBS) and rinsed in PBS. Transwells
were blocked in ES cell medium for 30 min at 37jC/5% CO2 and washed in
PBS. Differentiated ES cells were cultured on gelatin-treated plates for
10 days in the absence of a feeder layer. The cells were transferred to the
transwell plates and incubated overnight at 37jC/5% CO2. The transwell
was washed gently in PBS and cells were removed from within the transwell
using a dry cotton bud followed by two washes in PBS. This procedure was
repeated twice. The transwell was stained with crystal violet for 10 min,
washed in water and allowed to air-dry. Cells present on the underside of
the transwell (i.e., migrated cells) were counted by microscopy. The number
of cells on the bottom of the plate (i.e., cells which had migrated through
the pores and had become detached from the transwell) were also assessed
(none were observed). Error bars show the SE of all samples.

Results
Human ES cell differentiation is associated with a membranous E- to N-cadherin switch. E- and N-cadherin protein
expression was assessed in undifferentiated and differentiating

EMT Events during Human ES Cell Differentiation

HES4 cells using fluorescent flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1A, i).
Undifferentiated HES4 ES cells cultured on irradiated embryonic
fibroblasts ( feeder layer) expressed cell surface E-cadherin on >95%
of the population (Fig. 1A, i; E-cad, day 0), whereas N-cadherin was
absent from the majority of the cells (Fig. 1A, i; N-cad, day 0). At
day 10 following differentiation of the cells by their removal from
the feeder layer, a significant proportion of the population (>90%)
lacked cell surface E-cadherin (Fig. 1A, i; E-cad, day 10) and had
gained N-cadherin protein expression (Fig. 1A, i; N-cad, day 10).
Twenty days following the induction of differentiation, a significant
proportion of the cells exhibited low levels of cell surface
E-cadherin protein (Fig. 1A, i; E-cad, day 20) with N-cadherin
protein expression detected in >95% of the population (Fig. 1A, i;
N-cad, day 20). Determination of E-cadherin and N-cadherin
proteins was also assessed by Western blot analysis of total cell
lysates (Fig. 1A, ii). Total N-cadherin protein was absent from ES
cells differentiated for 5 days and subsequently detected at 10 and
15 days following differentiation of the cells (Fig. 1A, ii; N-cad). In
contrast, E-cadherin protein was detected in HES4 ES cells
differentiated for 5 days, whereas lower levels were observed at
days 10 and 15 following induction of differentiation (Fig. 1A, ii;
E-cad). Analysis of transcript expression in the undifferentiated and
differentiating HES4 population was assessed by RT-PCR analysis
(Fig. 1A, iii). N-cadherin transcripts were absent from undifferentiated ES cells (day 0) and rapidly up-regulated upon differentiation
of the cells (day 5), with levels peaking at day 15 and absent at day
20. In contrast, E-cadherin transcripts were detected in undifferentiated ES cells (day 0) and throughout the differentiation time
points analyzed (days 5–20).
HES4 ES cells were cultured for 12 days on a feeder layer to
induce spontaneous differentiation and assessed for expression of
N-cadherin (green) and OCT-4 (red) proteins by immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1B, i). OCT-4 protein was absent from a
proportion of the cells within the colony, showing that spontaneous differentiation had occurred, with N-cadherin protein expression correlating with loss of OCT-4. Examination of E-cadherin
(green) and N-cadherin (red) proteins under these culture
conditions showed discrete expression of the two proteins
(Fig. 1B, ii), showing that loss of cell surface E-cadherin is
associated with gain of cell surface N-cadherin. Confocal analysis
of E-cadherin (green) and 5T4 antigen (red) showed discrete
expression of the two proteins (Fig. 1B, iii), similar to that
observed for E-cadherin and N-cadherin. Low levels of 5T4 antigen
were detected in the cytoplasm of E-cadherin–positive cells
(Fig. 1B, iii), similar to that reported for mouse ES cells (42, 44).
Furthermore, determination of 5T4 (green) and OCT-4 (red)
proteins in spontaneously differentiating HES4 ES cells showed
that 5T4 expression correlated with loss of OCT-4 (Fig. 1B, iv).
Therefore, HES4 ES cell differentiation is associated with loss of
E-cadherin and expression of both N-cadherin and 5T4 proteins.
To assess changes in the actin cytoskeleton upon spontaneous
differentiation of hES cells, we assessed 5T4 expression and
filamentous actin arrangement in HES4 ES cells using confocal
microscopy (Fig. 1C). Although discrete areas of 5T4 expression
(green) were observed, this did not seem to be associated with
altered actin cytoskeleton arrangement (red) under these conditions. To assess the likelihood of an EMT event occurring during
hES cell differentiation, we assessed the expression of vimentin, a
specific subunit of intermediate filaments in mesenchymal tissue.
Undifferentiated HES4 ES cells exhibited low levels of vimentin
expression at the periphery of the colonies (Fig. 1D, i). In contrast,

www.aacrjournals.org

differentiating HES4 ES cells exhibited loss of OCT-4 protein,
and this was associated with increased expression of vimentin
(Fig. 1D, ii), suggesting that an EMT event occurs during this
process.
ES cell differentiation is associated with up-regulation of
E-cadherin repressor proteins. To determine whether downregulation of cell surface E-cadherin protein upon ES cell
differentiation was associated with the expression of E-cadherin
transcript repressors, we assessed the expression of Snail, Slug, and
E12/E47 transcripts using RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Undifferentiated HES4
ES cells lacked transcripts encoding Slug and exhibited low levels
of Snail transcripts (Fig. 2A; day 0). Upon differentiation of HES4 ES
cells in the absence of a feeder layer, both Snail and Slug transcripts
were increased, with significantly lower levels of the latter detected
at day 20 (Fig. 2A; days 5–20). E12/E47 transcripts were expressed
at similar levels in both undifferentiated and differentiating HES4
ES cells. Western blot analysis of Snail, Slug, and E12/E47 proteins
in whole cell lysates (Fig. 2B) showed the absence of Slug and low
levels of Snail proteins in undifferentiated HES4 ES cells (day 0).
Following induction of differentiation, both Snail and Slug proteins
were significantly increased (day 15). E12/E47 protein was detected
at similar levels in both undifferentiated and differentiated HES4
ES cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclear localization of Snail (Fig. 2C, i) and Slug
(Fig. 2C, ii) proteins were observed in a proportion of cells within

Figure 2. Human ES cell differentiation is associated with the expression of
Snail and Slug proteins. HES4 ES cells were maintained in an undifferentiated
state by culture in ES cell medium in the presence of a fibroblast feeder layer
and differentiated in monolayer culture by transfer of the cells to gelatin-treated
plates. A, transcript expression of Snail, Slug, E12/E47, and h-tubulin
(b-tub —control) was determined by RT-PCR in undifferentiated HES4 ES
cells (day 0) and in cells differentiated for 5, 10, 15, and 20 d. B, HES4 ES
cells were differentiated for 15 d and total cell lysates were assessed for
Snail, Slug, and E12/E47 proteins by Western blot analysis. C, HES4 ES cells
were differentiated for 10 d and assessed for (i) Snail, (ii ) Slug, and (iii ) E12/E47
proteins using immunofluorescent microscopy. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI ) shows the total cells within the field of view.

were maintained in an undifferentiated

determine MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity

the differentiating HES4 population. In contrast, E12/E47 protein
was detected in the nucleus of the majority of the population of
both undifferentiated (data not shown) and differentiating HES4
cells (Fig. 2C, iii). Up-regulation of SIP1 transcripts were also
detected following differentiation of the cells (data not shown).
Overall, these results show that during ES cell differentiation,
transcripts and proteins encoding known E-cadherin repressor
molecules are associated with a cell surface E- to N-cadherin
protein switch.
ES cell differentiation is associated with MMP proteolytic
activity and increased cellular motility. To determine whether
other EMT-like processes were occurring during ES cell differentiation, we assessed the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and
TIMP-2 transcripts in HES4 ES cells (Fig. 3A). Undifferentiated
HES4 ES cells lacked MMP-2 transcripts and exhibited low levels
of MMP-9 transcripts (Fig. 3A; day 0). Following the induction of
differentiation of the cells in the absence of a feeder layer, both
MMP-2 and MMP-9 transcripts were up-regulated and detected for
up to 20 days (Fig. 3A; days 5–20). TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 transcripts
were detected at similar levels throughout the differentiation
period. Zymogram analysis of gelatinase activity showed that
undifferentiated HES4 cells lacked MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity
(Fig. 3B, i, lane 2; lane 1 shows media without ES cells). Induction
of differentiation by removal of HES4 ES cells from a fibroblast
feeder layer for 5, 10, and 15 days resulted in proteolytic activity
associated with the 65 kDa active form of MMP-2 (Fig. 3B, i; lanes 3,
4, and 5, respectively). Although MMP-9 proteolytic activity was
not detected following differentiation of HES4 ES cells in the
absence of a feeder layer in ES cell medium, both MMP-2 and
MMP-9 were detected following differentiation of HES4 ES cells in

the neurobasal medium N2B27 [Fig. 3B, ii; day 5 (lane 1) and day 10
(lane 2)]. To further exemplify the EMT event during human ES cell
differentiation, we assessed the cellular migration of undifferentiated and differentiated (10 days) HES4 ES cells using 5-Am pore
size Transwell plates (Fig. 3C). ES cells differentiated for 10 days in
the absence of a fibroblast feeder layer exhibited >2-fold increased
motility compared with undifferentiated cells.
Loss of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contact in ES cells
induces reversible actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in the
absence of EMT-associated transcript expression. To determine
whether loss of E-cadherin in HES4 ES cells could induce EMTassociated events, we treated the cells with the E-cadherin
neutralizing antibody (nAb) SHE78.7 and assessed actin cytoskeleton arrangement and EMT-associated transcript expression
(Fig. 4). Control antibody (cAb)–treated cells maintained cell-cell
contact (Fig. 4A, i; cAb) and cortical actin cytoskeleton arrangement (Fig. 4A, ii; cAb). In contrast, treatment of HES4 ES cells with
nAb promoted loss of cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4A, i; nAb) and
polarized actin cytoskeleton arrangement (Fig. 4A, ii; nAb).
Abrogation of E-cadherin cell-cell contacts using nAb resulted in
loss of E-cadherin protein (data not shown), but the majority of the
cells maintained the expression of OCT-4 (Fig. 4B), showing that
inhibition of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contact does not induce
differentiation of the cells. RT-PCR analysis of EMT-associated
transcripts in cAb- and nAb-treated HES4 ES cells showed no
difference between the two treatments (Fig. 4C), showing that loss
of E-cadherin alone is insufficient to induce a full EMT event in ES
cells. Removal of SHE78.7 from HES4 ES cells restored both cell-cell
contact and cortical actin cytoskeleton arrangement within 7 days
(Fig. 4D, i and ii, respectively) and OCT-4 protein was expressed in

the majority of the population (Fig. 4D, iii). To determine the
differentiation potential of HES4 ES cells treated with nAb, we
cultured the cells in nAb for 7 days followed by removal of nAb and
overgrowth of the cells for 28 days in ES cell medium (Fig. 4D, iv).
HES4 ES cells treated with nAb for 7 days prior to differentiation
exhibited a similar transcript expression profile to HES4 ES cells
cultured under normal conditions (Fig. 4D, iv; day 0; ref. 35). By
contrast, removal of nAb and overgrowth of the cells resulted in
loss of OCT-4 transcripts and up-regulation of markers representative of the three germ layers and extra embryonic endoderm
(Fig. 4D, iv; day 28). These observations show that inhibition of
E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contacts in HES4 ES cells does not
induce the differentiation of the cells or up-regulation of EMTassociated transcripts. Furthermore, the effect of nAb-treatment of
HES4 ES cells is reversible, allowing subsequent differentiation of
the cells under appropriate conditions.
Inhibition of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contacts
increases cellular motility but decreases proliferation of
HES4 ES cells. To determine whether loss of E-cadherin in HES4
ES cells affected cellular motility, we assessed cAb- and nAb-treated
HES4 ES cells in a transwell assay (Fig. 5A). cAb-treated HES4 ES

cells exhibited low motility, similar to that observed in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 5A; HES4 +cAb and HES4 U, respectively). In
contrast, nAb-treated HES4 ES cells (HES4 +nAb) exhibited 2.5-fold
increased motility compared with cAb-treated (HES4 +cAb) ES cells.
Removal of nAb from HES4 ES cells for 5 days (HES4 nAb d5)
resulted in decreased motility that was not significantly altered
from that observed in either undifferentiated (HES4 U) or cAbtreated (HES4 cAb) ES cells. Analysis of HES4 ES cell proliferation
following treatment of the cells with cAb or nAb for 7 days showed
significantly decreased cell numbers in the latter (Fig. 5B).
Subsequent removal of nAb from the cells (Fig. 5B; nAb ) resulted
in restoration of cellular proliferation that was similar to that
observed in cAb-treated HES4 ES cells.
5T4 antigen is localized at the plasma membrane following
inhibition of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contact in ES cells.
To determine whether loss of E-cadherin could induce changes in
protein localization at the plasma membrane in HES4 ES cells, we
treated the cells with either cAb or nAb for 8 h and assessed
expression of the 5T4 oncofetal antigen using immunofluorescent
microscopy (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of E-cadherin cell-cell contacts
using nAb seemed to induce cell surface localization of 5T4

(Fig. 6A, ii), whereas cAb-treated cells exhibited significantly lower
levels of the antigen (Fig. 6A i). To confirm that 5T4 was localized
at the cell surface in nAb-treated HES4 ES cells, we assessed the
expression of the antigen using fluorescent flow cytometry (Fig. 6B,
i). Localization of the 5T4 antigen at the cell membrane was
significantly increased following treatment of HES4 ES cells with
nAb compared with cAb-treated cells. Removal of nAb from HES4
ES cells for 5 days resulted in decreased 5T4 expression at the cell
surface similar to that observed in cAb-treated cells (Fig. 6B, ii).
Therefore, abrogation of E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell contacts in
HES4 ES cells results in reversible plasma membrane localization of
the 5T4 antigen.

Discussion
The study of EMT events has provided insights into embryonic
development and the metastatic spread of epithelial tumor cells.
However, this research is impeded by the lack of a naturally
regulated in vitro model system allowing the study of spatial and

temporal events associated with this process (7). In this study, we
have shown that human ES cells represent a versatile model system
with which to study EMT events in real-time using a monolayer
differentiation assay. As proof-of-principle, we have shown a novel
role for E-cadherin in preventing cell surface localization of the 5T4
oncofetal antigen in human ES cells. Recently, it has been shown
that EMT occurs within individual colonies of primate and human
ES cells (45, 46). In the human ES cell study (45), it was shown
that EMT events were associated with the peripheral cells of the
colony when cultured under feeder-free conditions in conditioned
medium. Our method differs in that the cells are induced to
differentiate by their removal from the fibroblast feeder layer and
that EMT events are observed in the entire population of
differentiating ES cells, as defined by loss of E-cadherin and gain
of N-cadherin. Therefore, rather than EMT being associated with a
subpopulation of differentiating cells, it seems to be a definitive
step in human ES cell differentiation, at least under the conditions
we describe. We have recently shown an EMT event during mouse
ES cell differentiation (42), similar to that described in this
manuscript. Together, these data confirm that ES cells are a useful
in vitro model system with which to elucidate the mechanisms
associated with EMT during human development and may be
useful to model molecular and biochemical events that occur
during metastasis.
The similarities observed between the invasion properties of
placental trophoblast and tumor cells led to the identification of
the 5T4 oncofetal antigen (41). Antibodies raised against syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane glycoproteins resulted in the
isolation of a monoclonal antibody recognizing a cell surface
antigen, subsequently identified as 5T4 (41). 5T4 expression is
associated with increased motility and decreased adhesion in
epithelial cells. For example, forced expression of 5T4 cDNA in
murine epithelial cells resulted in loss of cell-cell contacts, downregulation of E-cadherin, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (47). Furthermore, 5T4 antigen expression has been detected
in various cancers and correlates with poorer clinical outcome in
breast, colorectal, and ovarian carcinomas (36, 38, 41). Although
E-cadherin expression has been shown to regulate cell surface
localization of the EphA2 receptor (48), we are not aware of any
reports correlating loss of E-cadherin with the presentation of
promigratory factors at the plasma membrane of epithelial cells.
Our data suggests that E-cadherin exhibits multiple functions in ES
cells; maintaining cell-cell contact and cortical actin cytoskeleton
arrangement as well as inhibiting plasma membrane localization of
the 5T4 antigen.
The hES cell EMT model system allows the elucidation of the
function of individual molecules within this process. For example,
we show that loss of cell surface E-cadherin is sufficient to induce
certain characteristics associated with a mesenchymal phenotype
in the absence of up-regulation of EMT-associated transcripts.
Therefore, although E-cadherin down-regulation plays a pivotal
role in EMT, this event is unable to induce a full EMT phenotype in
hES cells. We have recently shown that loss of E-cadherin in mouse
ES cells also results in plasma membrane localization of the 5T4
antigen (42). Furthermore, neither E-cadherin down-regulation nor
N-cadherin were required for the up-regulation of EMT-associated
transcripts, suggesting that these proteins do not actively induce a
full EMT event. However, both 5T4 and N-cadherin–null mouse ES
cells exhibited significantly decreased motility following EMT,
showing that these proteins act as promigratory factors during this
process in ES cells. The similarities between our observations in

A, undifferentiated HES4 ES cells were
treated with (i ) cAb or (ii ) E-cadherin nAb
SHE78.7 (nAb ) for 8 h and assessed for
DAPI (total number of cells, nuclei,
within the field of view) and 5T4 antigen
expression by immunofluorescent

and assessed for cell surface expression of
the 5T4 antigen using fluorescent flow
cytometry. Viable cells were gated using
forward and side scatter and the data
represents cells from this population.
Note that 5T4 antigen is detected at the
cell surface of nAb-treated ES cells.

and the data represents cells from this
population. Note that removal of nAb
resulted in similar levels of 5T4 antigen
at the cell surface compared with
cAb-treated cells.

mouse and human ES cells are striking and we hypothesize that
5T4 and N-cadherin function in a similar manner in both species,
that is, by imparting increased cellular motility upon ES cell
differentiation.
Snail genes have been observed in all EMT processes studied to
date (25, 26), and they function by binding to the E-cadherin
promoter resulting in gene transcript repression (26). The observation that these transcripts and proteins are up-regulated during
hES cell differentiation suggests that they may function to inhibit
E-cadherin transcript expression. However, Snail and Slug can also
function to inhibit apoptosis (26). During ES cell differentiation,
significant apoptosis is observed and Snail proteins may also impart
cellular survival during this process. MMPs have also been reported
to regulate cell surface E-cadherin protein by proteolytic cleavage
(1, 7), resulting in a soluble 80 kDa form of E-cadherin which is often
detected in tumor cell lines and biopsy samples (1, 7). It has been
shown that the 80 kDa soluble form of E-cadherin can induce MMP-2
and MMP-9 expression in tumor cell lines (1, 7). Therefore, several
mechanisms may act during hES cell EMT to regulate cell surface
E-cadherin protein expression. The ES cell model therefore provides
a useful in vitro system with which to study transcriptional and
proteolytic regulation of EMT-associated molecules.
Our data shows that an EMT event occurs during hES cell
differentiation and that this model system may provide an insight
into this process. Furthermore, we show a novel function for

E-cadherin in preventing cell surface localization of the 5T4
antigen. The similarities between the hES cell EMT and known
processes during cancer metastasis are striking. Patient mortality
following the metastatic spread of epithelial tumors is significantly
increased and these account for at least 80% of all cancers. The ES
cell model system may allow the study of EMT events in vitro and
the subsequent comparison with tumor biopsies/cell lines to
elucidate critical events associated with the onset of tumor cell
spread. However, although it is clear that events associated with
EMT occur during tumor cell metastasis, it is still unclear whether
EMT is a prerequisite for tumor cell spread or is simply associated
with this process. For example, there is recent evidence that tumor
cells could spread in the absence of EMT (49, 50). Therefore, ES cell
EMT constitutes a useful in vitro model system to study the effects
of specific molecules during this process to determine their
function in cellular motility and invasion.
