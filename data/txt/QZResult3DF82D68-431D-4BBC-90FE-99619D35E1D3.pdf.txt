Abstract
Human colorectal cancer cell lines are used widely to investigate tumor biology, experimental therapy, and
biomarkers. However, to what extent these established cell lines represent and maintain the genetic diversity
of primary cancers is uncertain. In this study, we proﬁled 70 colorectal cancer cell lines for mutations and
DNA copy number by whole-exome sequencing and SNP microarray analyses, respectively. Gene expression
was deﬁned using RNA-Seq. Cell line data were compared with those published for primary colorectal cancers
in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Notably, we found that exome mutation and DNA copy-number spectra in
colorectal cancer cell lines closely resembled those seen in primary colorectal tumors. Similarities included
the presence of two hypermutation phenotypes, as deﬁned by signatures for defective DNA mismatch repair
and DNA polymerase e proofreading deﬁciency, along with concordant mutation proﬁles in the broadly
altered WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGFb, and p53 pathways. Furthermore, we documented mutations enriched in
genes involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A, CHD6, and SRCAP) and histone methylation or acetylation
(ASH1L, EP300, EP400, MLL2, MLL3, PRDM2, and TRRAP). Chromosomal instability was prevalent in
nonhypermutated cases, with similar patterns of chromosomal gains and losses. Although paired cell lines
derived from the same tumor exhibited considerable mutation and DNA copy-number differences, in silico
simulations suggest that these differences mainly reﬂected a preexisting heterogeneity in the tumor cells. In
conclusion, our results establish that human colorectal cancer lines are representative of the main subtypes
of primary tumors at the genomic level, further validating their utility as tools to investigate colorectal cancer
biology and drug responses. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3238–47. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality (1). Human colorectal cancer cell
lines are an important, commonly used preclinical model
system for studying this disease, and have provided essential
insights into tumor molecular and cell biology. Cell lines are
a fundamental tool used in the discovery of new antitumor
compounds and for the discovery of drug sensitivity, resisAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research; 2Systems

Genomic Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines

represent and maintain the genetic diversity of primary
cancers remains controversial.
More than the past two decades, major cancer genes and
pathways central to colorectal cancer development have been
delineated, including the WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGFb, and p53
pathways. Two broad molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer
have emerged, characterized by MSI-H (15%) or chromosomal instability (CIN, 60%; refs. 8–10). MSI-H colorectal
cancers occur predominantly in the proximal colon, and often
show poor differentiation, mucinous histology, and increased
peritumoral lymphocytic inﬁltration (11). These tumors exhibit hypermutation caused by defective DNA mismatch repair
(MMR), tend to be near-diploid and to have a CpG island
methylator phenotype (CIMP), and harbor mutations in a
distinct set of driver genes, including BRAF, PTEN, and TGFBR2
(12–14). In contrast, chromosomally unstable tumors are more
common in the distal colorectum and tend to develop along
the classical genetic pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis, with
mutations in APC, KRAS, SMAD4, and TP53 (15).
Recent cancer genome sequencing studies have revealed
additional details of the genetic proﬁles of human colorectal
cancer, highlighting their diversity. An initial whole-exome
sequencing study on 11 microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal
cancers demonstrated that such tumors harbor 80 coding
sequence mutations with a small number of commonly mutated driver genes and a large number of "private" mutations (16).
Subsequently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network
reported comprehensive data on 223 unselected sporadic
colorectal cancers (17). Hypermutation was identiﬁed in
15% of carcinomas, with three quarters of these displaying
the expected MSI-high (MSI-H) phenotype associated with
epigenetic silencing and/or mutation of MMR genes. However,
one-quarter of hypermutated tumors did not show MSI-H and
seemed to be associated with DNA polymerase e (POLE)
mutations, perhaps representing a distinct colorectal cancer
subtype. Twenty-four genes were identiﬁed as signiﬁcantly
mutated in colorectal cancer, including several novel candidate genes such as ATM, ARID1A, TCF7L2, SOX9, and FAM123B.
A number of recurrent DNA copy-number alterations were
reported comprising potentially drug-targetable ampliﬁcations of ERBB2 and IGF2. A similar study on 74 pairs of primary
human colon tumors reported highly concordant results, and
in addition identiﬁed low frequency fusion transcripts involving R-spondin family members RSPO2 and RSPO3 (18).
Here, we report the ﬁrst comprehensive whole-exome and
DNA copy-number analyses of 70 of the most widely used
colorectal cancer cell lines, and undertake a detailed comparison of genetic alterations with those reported for TCGAanalyzed primary cancers. We demonstrate that the spectra
of mutations and DNA copy-number aberrations in colorectal
cancer cell lines are representative of primary tumors, including hypermutation phenotypes and targeting of major signaling pathways. Our data further highlight novel aspects of
colorectal cancer biology, including signiﬁcant enrichment of
mutated genes involved in chromatin remodeling and histone
methylation or acetylation. Our results verify established colorectal cancer cell lines as a useful preclinical model system, and
provide a comprehensive genomic data resource enabling

informed choices when selecting cell lines for functional and
pharmacogenomics research.

Wisconsin School of Medicine, Madison, WI), SNU-175, SNU283, and SNU-C4 were obtained from KCLB, LIM1215, LIM1899,
LIM2099, LIM2405, and LIM2551 were obtained from the
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, SW1222 were provided
by Prof. M. Herlyn (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA),
HDC101, HDC54, HDC82, HDC87, and HDC90 were provided by
Prof. M, Schwab (DKFZ, Germany), HCA46, HCA7, and HRA19
were provided by Dr. S.C. Kirkland (Royal Postgraduate Medical
School, United Kingdom), and RW2982 and RW7213 were
provided by Dr. P. Calabresi (Roger Williams General Hospital,
Providence, RI). Cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium and 10% FBS at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cell line
authentication was performed using the Promega StemElite ID
System at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QMIR,
Queensland, Australia) DNA Sequencing and Fragment Analysis Facility (January 2013). Cells were tested for mycoplasma
by the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Published exome-capture sequencing data on 223 patients with
colorectal cancer were retrieved from the TCGA (19). SNP array
data were available for 213 of these patients. Mutation data
were ﬁltered for exons and at splice sites (3 bp).
Exome-capture sequencing
Exome-capture was performed using the TruSeq Exome
Enrichment Kit (Illumina) and 100 bp paired-end read
sequencing performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the
Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF). Variant detection was implemented using a modiﬁed GATK Best Practice
protocol; variants were ﬁltered against known germline
variations and those detected in 114 in-house normal colorectal tissues (Supplementary Methods). Regions of known
germline chromosomal segmental duplications were excluded (20).
Transcriptome sequencing
RNA-Seq analysis was performed at the AGRF on an Illumina
HiSeq2000 to a depth of >100 million paired reads. Alignment
to the human reference genome (hg19) was achieved using

TopHat (21), and RPKM values calculated. Absence of gene
expression was deﬁned as a RPKM value of <1 (Supplementary
Methods).
SNP microarray analysis
SNP assays were performed by the AGRF using Illumina
Human610-Quad BeadChips (GSE55832) and processed using
GenomeStudio (Illumina). SNPs showing germline alterations,
based on 637 normal samples, were excluded. DNA copynumber segmentation was performed using OncoSNPv2.18
(22). Regions of signiﬁcantly altered genome were identiﬁed
using GISTIC2.0 (23).
Microsatellite instability analysis
MSI analysis was performed for the National Cancer Institute recommended microsatellite marker panel BAT25, BAT26,
D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250 using ﬂuorescently labeled
primers on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems;
ref. 24). MSI-H was diagnosed if instability was evident at 2 or
more markers.
CIMP marker and MLH1 promoter methylation analysis
MethyLight real-time PCR was performed for the Weisenberger and colleagues CIMP marker panel (IGF2, SOCS1,
RUNX3, CACNA1G, NGN1), MLH1, and the reference ALU
(C-4; ref. 25). The percentage of methylated reference (PMR)
was calculated for GENE:ALU ratio of template amount in a
sample against GENE:ALU ratio of template amount in methylated reference DNA. Samples with a PMR greater than 10 for
3 CIMP markers were classiﬁed as CIMP-positive.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the R statistical
computing software (http://www.R-project.org/). Differences
between groups were assessed using Fisher exact test or x2 test
for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous
variables. Correlation between RNA-Seq and microarray gene
expression data were assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient. Overlap of gene lists was assessed using a
hypergeometric test. GISTIC2.0 analysis for signiﬁcantly
altered focal regions of chromosomal deletion or gain/ampliﬁcation were adjusted for multiple testing, implementing a BHFDR adjusted Q-value cut-off of 0.05. All statistical analyses
were 2-sided and considered signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

pipeline sensitivity and speciﬁcity for nonsilent variants were
shown to be 79.2% and 98.6% in an analysis of 10 primary
colorectal cancers with and without paired normal tissue, with
the majority (93.4%) of false-negative calls resulting from
somatic mutations mimicking annotated germline variants
(Supplementary Data). Accuracy of mutation calling was veriﬁed by Sanger resequencing for 12 selected genes (APC,
CTNNB1, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, SMAD2, SMAD3,
SMAD4, FBXW7, and TP53) on 43 cell lines, with validation of
97.6% (165/169) of mutations (Supplementary Table S3).
For the 63 unique cell lines, the total number of putative
somatic mutations ranged from 219 to 8657 (mean ¼ 1498.3).
Similar to the primary colorectal cancers reported by The
TCGA (17), the prevalence of mutations varied substantially,
ranging from 6.6 to 260.0 per 106 bases, with evidence for
nonhypermutated and hypermutated groups (Fig. 1). Cell lines
with a mutation prevalence of >25 per 106 bases were designated as hypermutated. Hypermutation was observed in 34.9%
(22/63) of cell lines as compared with 15.7% (35/223) of the
TCGA cancers (P < 0.001). 86.3% (19/22) of hypermutated cell
lines exhibited MSI-H, similar to the proportion found in
cancers (80.0%, 28/35, P ¼ 0.725). MSI-H status in cell lines
was associated with MLH1 hypermethylation, mutations in
MMR genes and presence of CIMP (P < 0.009; Fig. 1). Consistent
with the established association between MSI-H and proximal
tumor location in colorectal cancer, all MSI-H cell lines with
available site details originated from the proximal colon (Supplementary Table S1). There was no evidence of imbalance in
site distribution between cell lines and cancers (P ¼ 0.937).
Mutation spectra in hypermutated colorectal cancer cell
lines
Compared with nonhypermutated cell lines, MSI-H cell lines
displayed a higher number of InDels (41.1-fold; P < 0.001) and
SNVs (9.7-fold; P < 0.001) as observed in the TCGA cancers

Results
Exome mutation proﬁles in 70 colorectal cancer cell lines
Seventy commonly used colorectal cancer cell lines, comprising 63 unique lines and 7 duplicate lines, were analyzed for
mutations in protein-coding exons and exon–intron boundaries by whole-exome capture sequencing (Supplementary
Table S2). In all cases, >20-fold coverage of >80% of targeted
exons was achieved. As matched normal tissue for these cell
lines was not available, putative somatic mutations were
identiﬁed by annotation against databases of known human
germline variants. Regions of known germline chromosomal
segmental duplications were excluded to reduce the possibility
of false-positive variants caused by read mismapping. Mean

Genomic Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines

Figure 2. Types of mutations for 70 human colorectal cancer cell lines and 223 TCGA-analyzed primary cancers. A–C, counts of SNVs and InDels (A and B),
and proportions of nucleotide transitions and transversions (C). Paired cell lines originating from the same tumor are indicated by identical colored stars. MSIH, microsatellite instability-high; NSHP, nucleotide-substitution hypermutator phenotype; POLE EDM, missense mutation in the POLE exonuclease domain.

(InDels: 18.3-fold, SNVs: 10.8-fold; P < 0.001; Fig. 2A and B). As
expected, InDels in MSI-H cases tended to occur at nucleotiderepeat (N5 or NN3) sequences (MSI-H vs. nonhypermutated: cell lines 82.7% vs. 17.9%, cancers 73.4% vs. 38.4%; P <
0.001), a bias not observed for the SNVs (cell lines 2.9% vs. 3.7%,
cancers 2.3% vs. 2.9%; Supplementary Table S2). The SNV
spectrum differed signiﬁcantly between MSI-H and nonhypermutated cases, with an increased proportion of A>G/T>C
transitions (cell lines 1.5-fold, cancers 1.8-fold; P < 0.011) and
decreased C>G/G>C transversions (cell lines 4.5-fold, cancers 5.2-fold; P < 0.001; Fig. 2C).
A second type of hypermutated tumor was observed among
cell lines and the TCGA cancers. These cases were MSS and
compared with nonhypermutated cases exhibited a nucleotidesubstitution hypermutator phenotype (NSHP) characterized by
a substantial increase of SNVs (cell lines 16.8-fold, cancers 56.8fold; P < 0.005; Fig. 2A and B). The SNV spectrum in 2 of 3 NSHP
cell lines (HT115, HCC2998) and 7 of 7 NSHP cancers further
displayed increased proportions of C>A/G>T transversions
(MSI-H vs. nonhypermutated: cell lines 1.5-fold, cancers 2.4fold) and A>C/T>G transversions (cell line 3.8-fold, cancers 2.0fold), as well as decreased C>G/G>C transversions (cell lines
13.6-fold, cancers 22.3-fold; Fig. 2C). Combining cell lines and
cancers, this mutator phenotype was signiﬁcantly associated
with the presence of POLE mutations (NSHP: 90.0%, 9/10 vs. MSIH: 29.8%, 14/47 vs. nonhypermutated: 1.3%, 3/229; P < 0.001). In
addition, all nine NSHP cases with POLE mutation had at least 1
missense mutation in the POLE exonuclease domain (EDM), as
compared with only 1 of 17 non-NSHP cases with POLE mutation
(P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S4). 82.4% (14/17) of POLE
mutated non-NSHP samples were MSI-H, and there was no
evidence that the non-EDM POLE mutations in these cases

www.aacrjournals.org

modiﬁed the MSI-H phenotype with similar SNV frequencies
and transition/transversion spectra compared with MSI-H
cancers without POLE mutation (P > 0.05 for all comparisons).
A single NSHP cell line, HT55, exhibited a distinct bias to
A>T/T>A transversions (49.0% vs. nonhypermutated mean
4.6%) and was wild type for POLE, but a similar case was not
present among the TCGA cancers (Fig. 2C). This cell line
harbored a heterozygous truncating mutation in the MMR
gene PMS1, which may be related to this mutator phenotype,
although Pms1-deﬁcient mice have been reported to show no
evidence of tumor predisposition or hypermutation (26).
Chromosomal and subchromosomal aberrations
DNA copy-number alterations in cell lines were proﬁled
using Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChips. As anticipated,
DNA copy-number proﬁles were similar between cell lines and
primary cancers (Fig. 3A). Hypermutated MSI-H and NSHP
cases showed stable proﬁles with a modal chromosome copynumber of 2n. In contrast, nonhypermutated cases tended to
exhibit unstable proﬁles with modal chromosome copy numbers ranging from 2n to 4n in cell lines and 2n to 6n in cancers.
For nonhypermutated groups, the most common deleted
chromosome arms were 8p, 17p (including TP53), and 18q
(including SMAD4), and the most common gained regions were
chromosome 7, 8q (including MYC), 13, and 20q. Some differences were apparent between cell lines and primary cancers,
including more frequent chromosome 4 deletions in nonhypermutated and chromosome 7 gains and 18q deletions in
hypermutated cell lines.
Focal regions signiﬁcantly targeted by DNA copy-number
alterations in both cell lines and cancers were deduced using
GISTIC2.0 software (23). Eleven and 4 signiﬁcant focal regions

were found to overlap between nonhypermutated and hypermutated groups, respectively (Fig. 3B and C and Supplementary Table S5). For nonhypermutated cases, overlapping
regions included gain/ampliﬁcation of MYC, a known key
mediator of colorectal tumorigenesis (27), and deletion of
the candidate cancer genes PARK2 and WRN, detected in
29.5% and 36.3% of cell lines and 21.9% and 31.6% of primary
cancers, respectively. The 4 recurrent regions identiﬁed in
hypermutated cases—which were also present in the nonhypermutated group—were all known fragile sites (including
FHIT, A2BP1, WWOX, or MACROD2), the functional relevance
of which is uncertain.
Cancer genes and pathways
Gene mutation proﬁles, excluding silent mutations, were
compared between colorectal cancer cell lines and primary

cancers. Only genes with well-deﬁned expression in cell lines
[reads per kilobase per million reads mapped (RPKM) >1 in at
least 3/13 colorectal cancer cell lines analyzed by RNA-Seq]
were considered (n ¼ 20,702 genes; Supplementary Table S6).
NSHP cases were excluded from this comparison because of
the small sample size.
Mutation landscapes of cell lines markedly resembled those
of primary cancers. In both cohorts, nonhypermutated cases
displayed a small number of distinct mutation peaks, with APC,
TP53, and KRAS being the most common targets, whereas
hypermutated MSI-H cases showed frequent mutations in
multiple genes, with the anticipated bias to genes comprising
nucleotide repeats (Supplementary Tables S7). Signiﬁcant overlap was observed for the top 5% of mutated genes (based on the
proportion of affected samples), with 54 and 62 genes intersecting for nonhypermutated and MSI-H groups, respectively

Genomic Landscape of Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines

Integrating mutation and DNA copy-number data across
cell lines and primary cancers showed the anticipated tumor
suppressor signatures for APC, TP53, SMAD4, and SOX9 with a
signiﬁcant overrepresentation of 2 mutational hits (2þ mutations or 1 mutation and loss of heterozygosity; P < 0.023). There
was further an association of mutation in BRAF, ERBB3,
PIK3CA, and KRAS with copy-number gain of 5 at the
respective chromosomal regions (P < 0.018). Trends to mutual
exclusivity between pathway member mutations were
observed for KRAS and BRAF, TP53, and ATM (P < 0.005).

Figure 4. Mutation frequencies for WNT, MAPK, PI3K, TGFb, and p53
pathway members as well as chromatin regulators identiﬁed among the
top 5% of mutated genes overlapping between colorectal cancer cell
lines and TCGA-analyzed primary cancers for nonhypermutated or
hypermutated MSI-H samples.

(P < 0.001; Supplementary Tables S8). Overlapping genes
included the expected members of the WNT, MAPK, PI3K,
TGFb, and p53 pathways. For nonhypermutated cases, these
comprised APC, CTNNB1, FBXW7, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, SMAD4,
and TP53, as well as the candidate cancer genes, AXIN2, BCL9L,
FAT1, SOX9, ERBB3, PIK3C2B, TIAM1, and ATM. For MSI-H
cases these encompassed APC, FBXW7, PIK3CA, and TGFBR2,
along with the candidates CREBBP, TCF7L2, RNF43, and
ACVR2A. Mutation distributions across colorectal cancerassociated signaling pathways were also similar between
nonhypermutated cell lines and cancers, with the same
pathway members tending to show the highest mutation
frequencies (Fig. 4). Greater variability in mutation frequencies between pathway members was observed for MSI-H
cases, at least partly related to the higher mutation background and smaller sample size. A notable difference for
MSI-H cases was a differential prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations, which were frequent in cell lines (47%) but not
reported in primary cancers (P < 0.001).
In addition to the established colorectal cancer-associated
pathways, signiﬁcant enrichment was observed for mutations in chromatin-state regulators (P < 0.001; gene ontology
enrichment analysis). These comprised ASH1L, CHD6,
PRDM2, and MLL3 in nonhypermutated and ARID1A, EP300,
EP400, MLL2, CHD6, PRDM2, TRRAP, and SRCAP in MSI-H
cases (Supplementary Table S8). Approximately 49% and
19% of nonhypermutated and 100% and 93% of MSI-H cell
lines and primary cancers carried mutations across these
candidates, respectively.

COLO205, CX-1/HT29, Gp2D/Gp5D, LS174T/LS180, and
DLD1/HCT8/HCT15), and 1 pair derived from a primary tumor
and subsequent lymph node metastasis (SW480/SW620).
LS174T and LS180 were established by trypsin treatment and
scraping of primary cultures from the same tumor, respectively
(28), and have been shown to differ with respect to E-cadherin
expression and cell adhesion, with LS174T displaying complete
loss of E-cadherin protein (2, 29).
Assessment of the overlap between mutations detected in
paired cell lines identiﬁed substantial discrepancies, with 63
and 356 mutational differences in the nonhypermutated pairs
COLO201/COLO205 and CX-1/HT29, and 2,763, 480, 6,503,
5,377, and 6,369 mutational differences in the MSI-H pairs
Gp2D/Gp5D, LS174T/LS180, DLD1/HCT8, DLD1/HCT15, and
HCT8/HCT15 (Fig. 5). Eight hundred and forty-nine mutations
differed in the nonhypermutated primary/metastasis pair
SW480/SW620. Nonsilent and silent mutations contributed in
similar proportions to these discrepancies (54.4% vs. 56.6%),
suggesting no selection for these differential alterations.
DNA copy-number proﬁles showed multiple differences for
nonhypermutated pairs, with 41.1% and 53.8% of the genome
varying for COLO201/COLO205 and CX-1/HT29 (Fig. 5). In
contrast, discrepancies were limited in MSI-H pairs with 0.2%,
0.4%, 6.6%, 2.9%, and 4.3% of the genome differing between
Gp2D/Gp5D, LS174T/LS180, DLD1/HCT8, DLD1/HCT15, and
HCT8/HCT15, respectively. 47.5% of the genome differed in the
nonhypermutated primary/metastasis pair SW480/SW620.
Notably, mutation differences between paired cell lines did
not obscure known driver genes. For the established colorectal
cancer genes APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF, 29 of
33 (87.9%) nonsilent mutations were concordant between cell
line pairs.

Discussion
In this study we show that the mutation and DNA copynumber landscapes determined for 70 colorectal cancer cell
lines closely resemble those of primary tumors, underscoring
the utility of cell lines as an appropriate model system for this
malignancy. The 3 molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer
recently deﬁned by the TCGA, nonhypermutated, hypermutated with microsatellite instability, and hypermutated without microsatellite instability were faithfully captured in the
cell line panel. As expected, MSI-H cell lines exhibited

hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter and/or mutations in
MMR genes, whereas hypermutated lines without microsatellite instability were instead characterized by mutations in the
exonuclease domain of POLE. Consistent with defective DNA
POLE proofreading function, the latter tumors showed a
nucleotide substitution hypermutator phenotype with a bias
to C>A/G>T and A>C/T>G transversions. Germline missense
mutations in the POLE exonuclease domain have recently been
associated with familial predisposition to colorectal cancer
(30), and elevated tumor predisposition and base-substitution
mutations observed in Pole exonuclease-mutant mice (31).
Similarly, somatic missense mutations in the POLE exonuclease domain have been reported in 7% of endometrial cancers,
with good evidence of associated hypermutation (32).
Although differences in prognosis and chemotherapy response
have been extensively documented for nonhypermutated versus MSI-H tumors (2–4), clinical characteristics of POLEmutant NSHP tumors are unknown. Our identiﬁcation of 2
cell lines representative of this colorectal cancer subtype will
facilitate an investigation of the speciﬁc aspects of the biology
of these tumors, particularly in relation to identifying therapeutics that may exploit their unique genomic instability.
Consistent with previous lower-resolution data (33), DNA
copy-number proﬁles were similar between colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors, with nonhypermutated
cases tending to exhibit chromosomal instability, whereas
both MSI-H and NSHP cases had overall stable copy-number
proﬁles. Patterns of whole and partial chromosome gains
and losses were largely concordant. Besides recurrent gain/

ampliﬁcation of the established colorectal cancer gene MYC,
recurrent regions of deletion in nonhypermutated cases
included the candidate cancer genes PARK2 and WRN. WRN
has important roles in homologous recombination repair,
MUTYH-mediated repair of oxidative DNA damage, and
telomeric recombination (34–36), and WRN germline mutations are associated with chromosomal instability and cancer predisposition (37). PARK2 deletion has been previously
reported in sporadic colorectal cancer, and Park2 deﬁciency
shown to accelerate intestinal adenoma development in Apc
mutant mice (38).
The mutation landscapes in nonhypermutated and hypermutated MSI-H cases showed close resemblance in cell lines
and primary tumors, with the expected alterations in the WNT,
MAPK, PI3K, p53, and TGFb pathways. Besides these main
colorectal cancer–associated pathways, multiple chromatinstate regulators were enriched among the top 5% of mutated
genes, including proteins involved in chromatin remodeling
(ARID1A, CHD6, and SRCAP) and histone methylation or
acetylation (ASH1L, EP300, EP400, MLL2, MLL3, PRDM2, and
TRRAP). Overall, 24% of nonhypermutated and 96% of MSIH cases harbored mutations in these genes. Trends for mutations to cluster in chromatin regulators have been reported in
multiple other cancer types, including liver cancers (39), gastric
adenocarcinoma (40), and transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder (41), suggesting potential pathogenicity of these
alterations.
Paired cell lines originating from the same tumor showed
considerable differences for both mutations and DNA copy-

number proﬁles. Nonhypermutated pairs differed for up to
356 mutations and 54% of genome copy number, whereas
MSI-H pairs differed for up to 6,503 mutations and 6.6% of
genome copy number. The two main possible reasons for
these differences are preexisting heterogeneity between the
cells from the original tumor grown out to establish these
paired lines, or acquisition of alterations as a result of longterm culture. Assuming a normal mutation rate of 108 (per
bp per cell generation) for nonhypermutated and 100-fold
elevated rate for hypermutated pairs and absence of selection (42), cell lines established from tumor cells separated by
an average of 328 and 66 replications would be expected to
exhibit the observed mutational differences with a >99%
probability, respectively (Supplementary Data and Table S9).
In contrast, mutations acquired during serial passaging in
culture are not anticipated to reach a detectable 10% level
before 9,034 and 4,266 replications, respectively (Supplementary Data and Fig. 6). Although serial cell passaging may have
been common-place at the time when these paired cell lines
were established >20 years ago, stock-keeping practices to
limit the number of replications were soon introduced.
Preexisting mutation heterogeneity in the original tumor
therefore seems highly likely to account for the majority of
the detected differences. Numbers of replications may be
expected to be larger between cells from a primary tumor
and subsequent metastasis, and accordingly our corresponding nonhypermutated cell line pair showed a 4-fold
higher number of mutational differences than the other
nonhypermutated pairs. Importantly, mutational differences
across paired cell lines did not obscure known driver genes,
with 88% of nonsilent mutations in established colorectal
cancer genes concordant between pairs.
Despite the high level of similarity between colorectal cancer
cell lines and primary tumors, there were a number of differences. These included overall higher mutation and DNA copynumber frequencies, as well as a greater proportion of detected

InDels in cell lines. These discrepancies may be related to
differences in exome-capture and sequencing platforms, bioinformatics pipelines, the presence of contaminating normal
tissue in primary cancers, and accuracy of assigning somatic
alterations in cell lines. Cell lines further showed a higher
proportion of hypermutated cases, and exhibited differences in
the prevalence of aberrations for certain genes and genomic
regions such as CTNNB1 mutations in MSI-H cases. These
latter ﬁndings may be a reﬂection of preferential growing out of
cell lines from primary tumors (or their respective subclones)
that contain these aberrations, a contention supported by the
observation that only 10% to 15% of colorectal cancers give
rise to cell lines (43). Another possibility is that some of the
mutations have been acquired and selected for in tissue
culture.
A caveat to our analysis of protein-coding genes is that we
could not report on untranslated exonic regions (UTR), as the
latter were inconsistently covered by our study and the TCGA.
UTR mutations can impact on RNA splicing, stability, or
translation as previously highlighted for MSI-H colorectal
cancer (44). In the comparison of gene mutation proﬁles, we
chose to exclude silent mutations (other than those affecting
splice sites), although some of these may similarly have functional consequences (45).
In conclusion, our comparative analysis of the genomic
landscapes of human colorectal cancer cell lines and TCGAanalyzed primary cancers identiﬁed cell lines representative of
the three main mutational colorectal cancer subtypes. Within
these molecular subtypes, although some differences were
evident, cell lines showed globally similar genetic alterations
to primary cancers, including genome-wide mutation, DNA
copy number, and driver gene mutation proﬁles. Accordingly,
gene expression proﬁles of colorectal cancer cell lines have
previously been shown to broadly represent those of primary
tumors (46). Our genomic data signiﬁcantly expand on cancer
cell line characterization efforts by the major cancer genome
