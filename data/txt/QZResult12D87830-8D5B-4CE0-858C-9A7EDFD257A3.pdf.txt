BACKGROUND: Although obesity is an established risk factor for developing colon cancer, its prognostic impact and relation to
patient sex in colon cancer survivors remains unclear. METHODS: The authors examined the prognostic and predictive impact of the
body mass index (BMI) in patients with stage II and III colon carcinoma (N ¼ 25,291) within the Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints
(ACCENT) database. BMI was measured at enrollment in randomized trials of 5-fluorouracil–based adjuvant chemotherapy. Association of BMI with the time to recurrence (TTR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined using Cox
regression models. Statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, obese and underweight patients
had significantly poorer survival compared with overweight and normal-weight patients. In a multivariable analysis, the adverse prognostic impact of BMI was observed among men but not among women (Pinteraction ¼ .0129). Men with class 2 and 3 obesity (BMI
35.0 kg/m2) had a statistically significant reduction in DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.33; P ¼ .0297)
compared with normal-weight patients. Underweight patients had a significantly shorter TTR and reduced DFS (HR, 1.18; 95% CI,
1.09-1.28; P < .0001) that was more significant among men (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50; P < .0001) than among women (HR, 1.11; 95% CI,
1.01-1.23; P ¼ .0362; Pinteraction ¼ .0340). BMI was not predictive of a benefit from adjuvant treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and
underweight status were associated independently with inferior outcomes in patients with colon cancer who received treatment in

INTRODUCTION
The increasing prevalence of obesity and its association with both cancer risk and prognosis have major importance in
public health. Approximately 34% of adults in the United States are obese, which is defined as having a body mass index
(BMI)1,2 30 kg/m2. Rates of obesity have increased 2-fold among adults and 3-fold among children in the past 30 years
in the United States.3 Although obesity is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death,4-8 its
association with mortality in survivors of CRC is less clear, and inconsistent results have been reported.9-12 Within clinical
trials of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, the obese subgroup has represented 17% to 35% of the
study cohorts, which has limited the statistical power for comparison with survival outcomes. Evidence indicates that the
time frame during which BMI is estimated or determined (ie, prediagnosis vs postdiagnosis) may also influence its prognostic impact.13 To date, there are inconsistent data as to whether the association of BMI with CRC survival may differ by
patient sex.9,11
In the current study, we determined the association of BMI with colon cancer prognosis and examined its potential
predictive impact for the outcome of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)–based adjuvant chemotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that
obese patients have an increased risk of colon cancer recurrence and death compared with normal-weight patients that
may be more evident in men compared with women. We used the Adjuvant Colon Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) database, a pooled resource of >20,000 participants in national and international colon cancer adjuvant chemotherapy trials.14 This database provides a unique opportunity to definitively address the impact of BMI on clinical outcomes in
patients with colon cancer. Clarification of the role of BMI in prognosis can influence patient education and management,
because body weight represents a modifiable factor that may influence patient outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

We used the ACCENT Group14 database, which contains
data on TNM stage II and III colon cancers (N ¼ 25,291)
from patients who participated in 21 randomized trials of
5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy conducted in North
America and Europe (Table 1). We included all trials that
had the following data: BMI, age, tumor stage, sex, and
censoring variables for clinical outcome. The database
does not include data on toxicity or comorbid conditions.
All studies were approved by institutional review boards at
the respective study sites, and all participants provided
written informed consent. This study was conducted
under an institutional review board-approved protocol.
Measurement and Categorization of Body
Mass Index

Body weight and height were measured and recorded at
study enrollment by trained staff and were used to calculate the BMI (in kg/m2). BMI categories were created on
the basis of World Health Organization classifications
and previous reports1 as follows: underweight, BMI <20
kg/m2; normal weight, 20 to 24.9 kg/m2; overweight, 25
to 29.9 kg/m2; and obese, 30 kg/m2 (class 1 obese,
30-34.9 kg/m2; class 2 and 3 obese, 35.0 kg/m2).
Statistical Analyses

The association of the categorical BMI with clinicopathologic variables was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test
(continuous) or the chi-square test (3 categories). The
Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used across the
ordered BMI categories (2-level variables). The association
of BMI with clinicopathologic variables was determined
using chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The
time to recurrence (TTR) was calculated as the number of
years from random assignment to colon cancer recurrence.
Disease-free survival (DFS) was measured from the date of
randomization to the first date of local, regional, or distant
relapse or death. Overall survival (OS) was calculated with
date of death as the outcome. Outcome variables were censored at 8 years, and their distributions were estimated
using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models15 were used to
explore associations of BMI with outcome variables. Score
(univariate) and likelihood-ratio (multivariate) test P values
were used to test the significance of each covariate after
stratifying by treatment group. Interaction effects were
tested in Cox models with the use of the likelihood-ratio
test. The prognostic impact of BMI also was modeled using
restricted cubic splines.16 All statistical tests were 2-sided.

RESULTS
The study included 25,291 patients with curatively
resected, TNM stages II and III colon cancer who participated in 21 randomized trials of 5-FU–based adjuvant
chemotherapy (Table 1). BMI was measured at study
entry and was categorized as indicated in Table 1: the median BMI was 25.4 kg/m2 (range, 10.0-70.3 kg/m2). After
a median follow-up of 7.8 years in living patients, 32%
had cancer recurrence, and 32% (N ¼ 7973) had died.

Across BMI categories, we observed statistically significant but clinically modest associations between BMI
and tumor stage, the number of metastatic lymph nodes,
age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and T-classification (all P < .0001) (Table 2).
Tumors from obese patients versus normal-weight patients
were more likely to be, stage III versus II, distal, and T1/T2
versus T3/T4 tumors (all P < .01) (Table 2). Compared
with normal-weight patients, obese patients were more likely
to have >3 metastatic regional lymph nodes (N2 disease; P
¼ .0001) (Table 2). Similar numbers of surgically removed
lymph nodes were examined from obese patients compared
with patients in other BMI categories. Compared with normal-weight patients, underweight patients were significantly
more likely to be younger (median, 58 years vs 61 years; P <
.0001), to be women (69% vs 48%; P < .0001), and to have
a performance status of 1 or 2 versus 0 (24% vs 19%; P <
.0001) (Table 2).
In univariate analysis, the BMI category was associated significantly with TTR, DFS, and OS across all adjuvant studies (Table 3). Overweight patients were not at

increased risk of recurrence or mortality compared with
normal-weight patients. Obese patients had shorter TTR
and worse DFS and OS (OS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.11;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.18; P ¼ .0014) versus normal-weight patients (Table 3). Underweight
patients also had shorter TTR and worse DFS rates (HR,
1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; P ¼ .0093) and OS rates (Table
3). Patients who had stage III tumors versus stage II
tumors, poor differentiation, and increased numbers of
metastatic lymph nodes all had shorter TTR, DFS, and
OS (all P < .0001) (Table 3). Higher T-classification, but
not primary tumor site, and worse Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status were associated similarly with worse outcome (data not shown). Analysis by
patient sex revealed that the BMI category was significantly prognostic in men for TTR (P ¼ .0015), DFS (P <
.0001), and OS (P < .0001), but not in women (all P >

In a multivariable analysis, the BMI category was
associated significantly with TTR, DFS, and OS after
adjusting for covariates (see Table 4). Compared with
normal-weight patients, obese patients had poorer DFS
and OS (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17; P ¼ .0023), even
after adjusting for age, stage, treatment, and sex. Overweight and normal-weight patients had similar outcomes,
whereas underweight patients had significantly worse
TTR (P ¼ .0044), DFS (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28; P

The BMI category was significantly prognostic in
men (Table 4, Fig. 1A,C) for TTR (P ¼ .0009), DFS (P
< .0001), and OS (P < .0001) but not in women (all P >
.10; OS, Pinteraction ¼ .0129) (Table 4, Fig. 1B,D). Obese
and underweight men had significantly poorer clinical
outcomes versus normal-weight men (Table 4). A greater
impact of class 2 and 3 obesity versus class 1 obesity on
DFS and OS rates was observed among men (Table 4).
The significant interaction between BMI and clinical out1532

come variables was primarily because underweight men,
but not women, had inferior TTR (HR, 1.22; 95% CI,
1.05-1.42; P ¼ .0078), DFS (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.151.50; P < .0001), and OS (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.21-1.60;
P < .0001; Pinteraction ¼ .0340) compared with normalweight men.
We explored whether a curvilinear or quadratic relation could describe the observed results for BMI. By using
restricted cubic splines, we observed that the continuous

BMI (using 4 knots) displayed a significant curvilinear
relation with OS both overall (P < .025) (Fig. 2A) and
according to patient sex (Pinteraction ¼ 0.05) (Fig. 2B).
Underweight men had worse OS compared with underweight women, and obesity played a comparatively lesser
role in predicting poor OS (Fig. 2B). The relation
between continuous BMI and DFS and TTR was more
quadratic in nature, in which only 3 knots were significant
using restricted cubic splines. Given this finding, we modeled BMI as a quadratic variable in multivariate Cox models and observed that the quadratic BMI was associated
significantly with DFS (P < .0001) and TTR (P ¼ .0008)
after adjusting for age, stage, treatment, and sex.
We assessed whether BMI was predictive of benefit
from 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy among patients
with stage II and III disease. We examined 8 adjuvant
studies in which a treatment benefit was observed. Among
those 8 trials, 6 evaluated 5-FU versus observation, and 2
evaluated 5-FU plus oxaliplatin versus 5-FU. There was
Cancer

no statistically significant interaction for BMI and
treatment for TTR, DFS, or OS in either univariate or
multivariable analysis. The multivariate interaction models revealed a continued treatment benefit across all BMI
categories after adjusting for age, stage, and sex. Furthermore, there was no evidence for a differential treatment
effect by adjuvant chemotherapy regimen.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used BMI measured by trained personnel
at the time patients entered an adjuvant study. We
observed that obese patients, but not overweight patients,
had significantly poorer survival compared with normalweight patients after adjustment for covariates, and this
effect was most evident among patients who had severe
(class 2 and 3) obesity. An important finding of our study
is that an adverse impact of obesity on colon cancer outcomes was limited to men. Severely obese men had a 16%
increase in mortality relative to normal-weight patients.

Figure 2. Body mass index (BMI) is modeled using restricted cubic splines (A) in all patients and (B) according to patient sex for
overall survival (OS). Hazard ratios (HRs) for OS are illustrated for BMI values in kg/m2 (range, 15-40 kg/m2 relative to no effect).
Plots used 4 knots16, and all were statistically significant (P < .025). Instead of setting the y-axis in a log scale, transformation to
an HR scale was performed to enhance interpretability.

Another important finding is that underweight patients
had increased cancer recurrence and inferior outcomes.
A statistically significant interaction was observed between
underweight status and patient sex, whereby underweight men had a 39% increase in all-cause mortality
compared with normal-weight men or women. In previous studies, the inferior outcome among underweight
patients with cancer was attributed to noncancer–
related deaths.17,18 However, we observed a shorter
TTR and DFS for underweight patients, suggesting
that the impact on prognosis is cancer-related.
Inconsistent data exist for the impact of patient sex
on outcome in obese patients with colon cancer. In patients
with stage II and III colon cancers, the association between
obesity and mortality was reported to be stronger among
women than among men.9 In contrast, no differences
according to sex were observed in another study that also
examined data from colon cancer adjuvant trials.12 Our
finding of a stronger association of obesity with adverse
outcome among men versus women is consistent with the
reported higher rate of incident colon cancers among obese
men versus women.4,6,9,20 Mechanisms underlying this observation may be related to body fat distribution, because
BMI is related more closely to abdominal or central adiposity in men.21,22 Abdominal adiposity is associated with hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and the insulin-like
growth factor-I axis as potential mediators of increased
1534

CRC risk and mortality.23-25 The attenuated impact of
obesity on colon cancer outcomes observed among women
versus men in our study may be because of an effect modification by estrogen. Estrogen levels correlate with BMI in
postmenopausal women, because their major source is conversion from androgens in adipose tissue.26 The association
of obesity with CRC risk is reduced after menopause,27
and hormone-replacement therapy is consistently associated with reduced colon cancer mortality.28-30
Excess mortality among underweight patients with
colon cancer has been attributed to noncancer causes, and
mainly to chronic respiratory conditions.18 In our study,
differences in performance status based on BMI were not
clinically meaningful, and strict eligibility criteria for the
adjuvant studies excluded patients who had significant
comorbidities. Because BMI was recorded at adjuvant trial
enrollment, it will be important to distinguish between
patients who are underweight but have stable weight over
time versus those who experienced significant cancerrelated weight loss before trial enrollment. Significant cancer-related weight loss may identify a poor prognostic subgroup, because cancer cachexia is associated with inferior
outcomes.31-33 Loss of adipose tissue accounts for the majority of the cancer-related weight loss, yet the preferential
loss of skeletal muscle adversely impacts mortality.34-36
Although it was not included in the ACCENT database,
cigarette smoking is associated with a lower BMI, and

current smokers who are underweight or obese have high
mortality rates,37 especially among men.38,39
Evidence suggests that the time frame during which
BMI is determined can influence its association with clinical outcome. A prospective cohort study found that selfreported BMI prediagnosis (mean, 7 years before CRC diagnosis) was associated independently with a statistically
significant increase in the risk of all-cause and cancer-specific mortality, whereas postdiagnosis BMI (mean interval, 1.5 years after diagnosis) was not.13 Prediagnosis BMI
measurements have also demonstrated a higher risk of allcause mortality in obese women versus normal-weight
women.17,40
We also determined whether BMI was predictive of
a clinical benefit in patients who received 5-FU–based adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation or no 5-FU. Our
data indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial for
patients in high-risk and low-risk BMI categories, and
outcomes were similar among those who received older
versus more modern adjuvant regimens as well as among
North American and European patients.
Strengths of our study include BMI measurements
performed by trained staff and the rigorous collection of
data on recurrence and survival within clinical trials over
an extended follow-up period. Limitations include the retrospective study design and lack of data on smoking, diet,
physical activity, menopausal status, or receipt of hormone replacement therapy, which may have independent
associations with outcomes and may inform the interpretation of sex-related differences. It is noteworthy that neither lifestyle factors nor demographic factors had an
impact on the association of prediagnosis BMI with survival among patients who had colon cancer in a large
cohort study.13 Although the large sample size within the
ACCENT database indicates that modest absolute differences in clinical outcomes may be statistically significant,
our results must be interpreted in that context.
In summary, obese and underweight BMI are associated with increased mortality in colon cancer survivors,
especially among men. In underweight patients, shorter
TTR and reduced DFS rates suggest increased tumor
aggressiveness. Together, these data suggest that interventions to modify patient BMI after a colon cancer diagnosis
have the potential to improve patient outcomes.
