Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection causes induction of several tumors/cancer
stem cell (CSC) markers and is known to be a major risk factor for
development of HCC. Therefore, drugs that simultaneously target
viral replication and CSC properties are needed for a risk-free
treatment of advanced stage liver diseases, including HCC. Here,
we demonstrated that (Z)-3,5,40 -trimethoxystilbene (Z-TMS)
exhibits potent antitumor and anti-HCV activities without exhibiting cytotoxicity to human hepatocytes in vitro or in mice livers.
Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) extensively induced expression of DCLK1 (a CSC marker) in the livers
of C57BL/6 mice following hepatic injury. Z-TMS exhibited
hepatoprotective effects against DEN/CCl4-induced injury by

reducing DCLK1 expression and improving histologic outcomes.
The drug caused bundling of DCLK1 with microtubules and
blocked cell-cycle progression at G2–M phase in hepatoma cells
via downregulation of CDK1, induction of p21cip1/waf1 expression, and inhibition of Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. Z-TMS also
inhibited proliferation of erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells (H1975) bearing the T790M EGFR mutation, most likely
by promoting autophagy and nuclear fragmentation. In conclusion, Z-TMS appears to be a unique therapeutic agent targeting
HCV and concurrently eliminating cells with neoplastic potential
during chronic liver diseases, including HCC. It may also be a
valuable drug for targeting drug-resistant carcinomas and cancers
of the lungs, pancreas, colon, and intestine, in which DCLK1 is
involved in tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 76(16); 4887–96. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

comorbidity (obesity and diabetes) exhibit faster progression of
liver disease and are difﬁcult to treat with standard interferonbased treatment regimens (3). The combinations of direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) drugs against three key HCV nonstructural proteins (NS3, NS5A, and NS5B) have shown remarkable efﬁcacy
(>90%) for curing the infection (4, 5). However, these drugs are
inaccessible to millions of patients and a complete recovery of
damaged liver by the HCV treatments alone has not been proven.
The majority of HCC cases are normally diagnosed at late
stages, and the use of curative surgery or other treatments are less
successful (6, 7). Kinase inhibitors have been shown to increase
survival only by a few months or are ineffectual in advanced HCC
patients (8). The activation of multiple signaling pathways and
enrichment of tumor/cancer stem cells (CSC) within the tumor
appear to mediate HCC multidrug resistance (9–11). CSCs represent small subpopulations within a tumor that possess selfrenewing capabilities and the ability to differentiate into a heterogeneous lineage within the tumor mass (12–14).
We previously demonstrated a positive correlation between the
levels of HCV replication and expression of an array of CSCassociated markers, including doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1;
refs. 15, 16). These changes appear to promote cellular dedifferentiation and the gain of CSC properties in HCV-positive cells. We
have further demonstrated that knockdown of DCLK1 results in
downregulation of HCV replication, cell migration, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple cancer cell lines

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of cancer-related death worldwide with a dismal 5-year
survival rate of 11% (1, 2). Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) is a major risk factor for the development of HCC (1, 3).
HCV patients coinfected with other viruses or with metabolic

and in mouse models (15, 17). There is currently no clear
choice for targeting CSCs efﬁciently (18, 19). DCLK1 is considered to be an important target for the treatment of tumors of
the liver, pancreas, and colon. HCV also induces EGFR that
facilitates HCV entry into the cells and promotes progression of
liver diseases (20, 21). The EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, has been
shown to downregulate HCV RNA levels in a mouse model
(20). These observations clearly suggest that cellular kinases
(DCLK1 and EGFR) are critical components of HCV-induced
chronic liver diseases.
The naturally occurring antioxidant, resveratrol (RVT) has
been extensively studied for possible health beneﬁts (22, 23),
including anticancer effects (24–26). However, its potential
beneﬁts could not be demonstrated in patients with malignancy due to poor absorption and extremely low bioavailability
(23, 27). The structurally related analogue (Z)-3,5,40 -trimethoxystilbene (Z-TMS), originally isolated from the bark of
Virola elongate, has been shown to inhibit microtubule polymerization, induce G2–M arrest, and inhibit ornithine decarboxylase activity (28, 29). Z-TMS also has long half-life and
limited drug clearance when administered intravenously
(30, 31). Here, we report mechanism(s) of Z-TMS's antiviral
and antitumor activities in several in vitro models and in DEN/
CCL4–induced liver injury in C57BL/6 mouse model. Z-TMS
exerts its inhibitory effects on tumors by diminishing DCLK1þ
cell population, interference with DCLK1-microtubule dynamics, cell-cycle arrest at G2–M phase, promotion of autophagy,
and causing nuclear fragmentation. It is considerably effective
against erlotinib-resistant T790M-mutant lung carcinoma cells
and may evolve as a potential candidate for the treatment of
HCV-induced advanced liver diseases, including HCC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents, antibodies, cells, and cell culture
The non–small cell lung adenocarcinoma cells (NSCLC,
H1975) and primary human hepatocytes were purchased from
ATCC and BD Biosciences, respectively. All other cells (endogenous) were tested before start of the studies using MycoAlert
Kit (Lonza) and were found negative for Mycoplasma. The parent
cell line Huh7 and human hepatocytes were recently evaluated
(January 14, 2016) for Hantaan virus, LCMV, and Mycoplasma
using PCR by IDEXX Bioresearch and were negative for these
agents. The characteristics of hepatoma Huh7-derived cell lines
(Huh7.5, GS5, and FCA4) have been described previously (15,
16, 32, 33). HCVþDCLK1þ hepatoma cells were generated by
transducing G418-resistant FCA4 cells with lentivirus expressing DCLK1 (isoform 1) tagged with RFP at the N-terminus. The
cells were cultured as described previously (34). Resveratrol
(Sigma) and Z-TMS (Cayman Chemical) were prepared in
DMSO and stored at 20 C. EGFR (aa 695–1210) and luciferase assay kits were purchased from Promega. The antibodies
were purchased from the following sources: DCLK1 (ab31704),
NS5B (35586), actin (ab1801), and Abcam; LC3B (2775),
cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175; 9664), and p-Akt (4069), from
Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-NS3 antibody (217-A)
from Virogen.
Z-TMS treatment of hepatoma cells infected with HCV
The cell culture–generated JFH1 HCV-2a infectious particles
(HCVcc) were produced as described previously (35). In brief,
JFH1 RNAs were electroporated into Huh7.5 cells and HCVcc

4888 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

particles were determined in cell culture supernatant. Huh7.5 cells
were infected with HCVcc at multiplicity of infection of 1 for 48
hours. Subsequently, the HCVcc-infected cells were treated with ZTMS (1 mmol/L) or equivalent amounts of DMSO in triplicates for
48 hours. The untreated infected cells were considered as positive
control, whereas uninfected Huh7.5 cells served as negative
control for detection of the HCV RNA by qRT-PCR. The HCV
RNA copy numbers per microgram of total RNAs in Z-TMS were
calculated and compared with vehicle-treated and -untreated
samples. JFH-1/GND RNAs (replication defective JFH1 mutant)
were used as negative control. In most of the experiments, HCVinfected cells were serum starved for 4 hours before harvesting.
Total RNAs from the HCV replicon–expressing cells were isolated
and subjected to RT-PCR as described previously (15).
Western blot analysis, cell survival, and cell proliferation
Cells treated with resveratrol, Z-TMS, or DMSO were washed
with PBS, collected, and lysed with mammalian protein extraction
reagent (M-PER; Thermo Scientiﬁc). Western blots were performed using 30–40 mg of cell lysates (15, 34) and antibodies
were diluted as recommended by the manufacturers. Each Western blot analysis was repeated three times. To evaluate target
protein to actin ratio, band intensities were calculated using
GelQuant software and mean ratios were presented. Cell viability
was determined using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer.
H1975 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 media supplemented
with 10% FCS. Z-TMS–treated and -untreated H1975 cells in a 96well culture plate were stained with DRAQ5 and scanned with
Operetta (PerkinElmer). Each treatment was done in quadruplets
and each well was analyzed for ﬁve different ﬁelds for the analysis
of nuclear fragmentation. The images (average of 5 ﬁelds for each
well) were analyzed by Columbus software. Wound-healing assay
for cell migration was carried out as described previously (34).
Cell-cycle analysis using ﬂow cytometry
Cells treated were with Z-TMS (1 mmol/L) or DMSO for 48
hours, harvested, and washed with PBS. The pelleted cells were
resuspended in PBS containing paraformaldehyde (2%) for 1
hour at 4 C, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, resuspended and
ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, and incubated overnight at 4 C. The cells
were treated with RNase A (200 mg/mL) and propidium iodide
(PI, 50 mg/mL; Sigma) for 30 minutes at 37 C in the dark and
stored at 4 C until acquisition of the ﬂow cytometry data. The
instrument was calibrated with unstained cells and sorted for PI
intensity. A total of 10,000 cell events were collected. Flow
cytometry data were collected and analyzed using the CELLQuest
program (Becton Dickinson).
Kinase activities
EGFR kinase assay was performed using the ADP-Glo kinase
assay and recombinant EGFR representing amino acids 695–1210
of the wild type using Promega's protocol. The kinase was treated
with 1 mmol/L of Z-TMS or erlotinib in triplicates, and luciferase
read-out for the EGFR kinase activities were compared with the
untreated control. The experiment was repeated twice.
HCC survival data and IHC of human liver tissues
To evaluate the relationship between DCLK1 expression levels
and survival of HCC patients, a Kaplan–Meier plot was generated

using the liver HCC (LIHC, total 369 cases) data provided by the
TCGA Research Network (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) using
the UCSC Genome Browser. Immunohistochemical staining of
liver tissues from patients with HCV and HCC were obtained from
the LTCDS (Minneapolis, MN; refs. 15, 34).
Hepatoma xenografts and treatment of C57BL/6 mice
with Z-TMS
All mice studies reported here were preapproved (protocols #
12-041 and 15-083) and supervised by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, which adheres to the PHS Policy IV.B.3.
Athymic nude Balb/c mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory and housed in pathogen-free conditions. One million
Huh7 cells were washed with PBS three times, resuspended in the
same buffer, and injected subcutaneously into the dorsal ﬂanks of
4- to 6-week-old mice as reported previously (34). Tumors were
measured with calipers and the volumes were calculated using
formula: 0.5  (length  width2).
Adult immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 30, 8-week-old,
generated by in-house breeding at OUHSC Rodent Barrier Facility) were randomized into 6 groups (5 mice/group). Groups 1
through 3 received two intraperitoneal injections of diethylnitrosamine [DEN, 25 mg/kg body weight (BW), one injection per
week] followed by twice-weekly injections of CCl4 (1 mL/kg BW)
for the next 7 weeks. Except group 1, groups 2 and 3 were also
treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg BW of Z-TMS dissolved in DMSO,
respectively. Group 4 received only Z-TMS (40 mg/kg BW) to
determine its possible toxicity. Groups 5 and 6 served as DMSO
and untreated controls, respectively, during the same period. At
the termination of the experiments, all the animals were euthanized and subjected to necropsy for collection and analysis of
blood or tissues of different organs.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in biological replicates of at
least three and repeated to conﬁrm the results. The graphs were
presented as mean  SD. The P values were calculated using the
Student t test. Results with P  0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Z-TMS is a potent HCV inhibitor
Published reports suggest potential beneﬁts of resveratrol
(3,5,40 -trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, RVT) and its analogues on
human health (reviewed in refs. 36, 37). We initially tested the
anti-HCV activities of RVT and its natural analogue Z-TMS in
hepatoma cell lines (GS5 and FCA4) expressing HCV-1b subgenomic replicons (16, 34). The results suggested that Z-TMS is
nearly 100 times more potent in downregulating the levels of HCV
NS5B polymerase, which is now considered a core target of direct
antiviral therapy (results not shown). Next, FCA4 cells were
treated with varying amounts (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5
mmol/L) of Z-TMS or equivalent amounts of DMSO for 48 hours.
The total lysates prepared from drug-treated and -untreated cells
were analyzed for NS5B and actin (loading control) levels. The
data suggest that Z-TMS inhibits NS5B expression in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–6). Similar results were
obtained with GS5 cells (not shown). The DMSO solvent control
had no inhibitory effect on the NS5B levels (lanes 7–11) as
compared with the untreated control (lane 1). Under these con-

ditions (0.1–1.0 mmol/L Z-TMS for 48-hour treatment), FCA4
cells as well as normal human hepatocytes remained fully viable
(Fig. 1B and C).
To examine whether Z-TMS inhibits HCV replication in an HCV
infection model, Huh7.5 cells were infected with tissue culture–
generated JFH1 viruses (HCVcc) for 48 hours to allow replication
of the viral RNA. The infected cells were then treated with 1 mmol/L
of Z-TMS or vehicle for 48 hours. Total RNAs isolated from these
cells were subjected to qRT-PCR to determine the levels of HCV
replication. As expected, the JFH1 RNA copy number was drastically reduced (10 times) by Z-TMS treatment as compared with
the DMSO-treated or -untreated cells (Fig. 1D). The results were
fully corroborated by the dramatic reduction in NS3 level (Fig. 1E,
lane 3) as compared with the controls (lanes 2 and 4).
Z-TMS disrupts DCLK1-microtubule dynamics
Microtubules are highly dynamic structures whose regulations
are critical for HCV replication, cell division, cell migration, and
cell polarity. The CSC marker DCLK1 associates with microtubules and stimulates polymerization of tubulins. We have previously shown that DCLK1 is overexpressed in liver tissues derived
from patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Its expression is also
correlated with activation of inﬂammatory and protumorigenic
signals as well as hepatoma cell migration (34). These observations led us to investigate the signiﬁcance of DCLK1 overexpression in patient survival and effects of Z-TMS on DCLK1 interaction
with microtubules or microtubule dynamic instability. As shown
in Fig. 2A, DCLK1 is overexpressed in liver tissues of HCV-positive
patients with cirrhosis and HCC but not in normal liver. The
Kaplan–Meier plot suggests that the 5-year survival rate is approximately reduced by three times in HCC patients (n ¼ 369) with
hepatic DCLK1 overexpression (Fig. 2B, red and black lines) as
compared with the patients with low DCLK1 levels (green line). In
a mouse tumor xenograft model described previously (34), large
tumors (average size of 4–4.5 cm3) derived from Huh7 cells
exhibited extensive staining for human DCLK1 except the one
that was smaller in size (0.65 cm3; Fig. 2C). Because of DCLK1's
important roles in microtubule dynamics, HCV replication and
tumor growth in addition to the ability of HCVþDCLK1þ hepatoma cells to form spheroids (15, 16), we examined the effects of
Z-TMS on HCVþDCLK1þ cells. These cells were isolated from
FCA4 cells coexpressing recombinant RFP-DCLK1 and HCV subgenomic replicon by FACS method. As shown in Fig. 2D, expression of HCV NS5B polymerase in HCVþDCLK1þ hepatoma cells
was signiﬁcantly reduced by 1 mmol/L of Z-TMS treatment (lane 3)
as compared with controls (lanes 1 and 2). Z-TMS treatment also
caused signiﬁcant inhibition in the proliferative potential of these
cells (Fig. 2E). We carried out confocal immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy to determine localization of DCLK1 with microtubule in these cells after Z-TMS treatment. The results revealed
that Z-TMS induces bundling of microtubules and speckle-like
structures of DCLK1–microtubule complexes (Fig. 2F, bottom).
However, the untreated and DMSO-treated cells exhibit normal
distribution of DCLK1 (red) and tubulin (green) or their
complexes (yellow). Collectively, these results indicate a direct
relationship of DCLK1 with the survival of HCC patients and
possibility of targeting HCV-positive DCLK1-overexpressing
hepatoma cells by Z-TMS.
We used a 3D magnetic levitation method (38) to culture GS5
cells as visible cell spheroids/aggregates (Fig. 3A). The levels of
NS5A-GFP green ﬂuorescence indicated continued HCV

Determination of dose response of Z-TMS for the inhibition of HCV replication and evaluation of cytotoxicity. A, Huh7 hepatoma cells expressing HCV-1b replicon
(FCA4) were treated for 48 hours with varying amounts of Z-TMS (lanes 2–6) or DMSO (lanes 7–11). The total lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis for NS5B.
Lane 1, untreated control. The NS5B band intensities in each lane were quantitated using GelQuant, and NS5B to actin ratios were calculated. The results are
representative of three independent experiments. B and C, determination of cytotoxicity of Z-TMS (at 0.1 to 2.5 mmol/L) or corresponding DMSO using cell viability

presented as mean  SD. D, Z-TMS inhibits replication of HCV-2a (JFH1). Huh7.5 cells in 12-well culture plates were infected with JFH1 virus (HCVcc) for 48 hours.
Subsequently, the cells were treated with Z-TMS (1 mmol/L) or vehicle in triplicates for the next 48 hours. The HCVcc-infected cells (untreated, solid black bar) were
considered as positive control, whereas untreated parent Huh7.5 cells (Huh7.5 control) served as negative control for detection of HCV RNA by qRT-PCR. The HCV
RNA copy numbers per microgram of total RNAs in Z-TMS–treated cells (hatched bar) were compared with DMSO-treated (gray bar) and untreated (black bar)
samples. The data are presented as mean  SD;  , P < 0.05 and   , P < 0.0001, respectively. E, Western blot analysis for detection of NS3 in total lysates of

replication in the spheroid-like cultures (Fig. 3A, inset). Immunohistochemical staining of these aggregates revealed different
cell phenotypes. Although large cells displayed extensive CK19
expression (circulating tumor cell marker) and cell-to-cell contacts, a low number of unique small cells were DCLK1 positive.
This observation clearly suggests heterogeneous cell phenotypes
in the spheroids. Z-TMS successfully inhibited growth of this
cellular mass (Fig. 3B).
Z-TMS causes G2–M cell-cycle arrest, inhibition of Akt
phosphorylation, and upregulation of p21Cip1/Waf1 in
hepatoma cells
GS5 cells, which express a NS5A-GFP chimeric protein
encoded by HCV-1b subgenomic RNAs, and Huh 7.5 cells were
treated with 1 mmol/L of Z-TMS for 48 hours and stained with
PI for cell-cycle analysis. The results clearly suggest that most
GS5 cells and Huh7.5 parent cells were stalled in the G2–M
phase (>90%) with a concomitant reduction in the G1 and Sphases (Fig. 4A). However, DMSO-treated and untreated cells
showed similar cell-cycle distribution. The result shows that the
observed change in cell cycle was induced by Z-TMS and not by
the DMSO (solvent). Similar Z-TMS effects were observed for

4890 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

other hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and FCA4, not shown). Next,
total lysates of the drug-treated and -untreated cells were
subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of proteins
involved in cell-cycle checkpoints. Z-TMS treatment caused
downregulation of total cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)
with a concomitant induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 expression (Fig.
4B, lane 3), which is a potent inhibitor of CDK1 and CDK2.
Also, p21Cip1/Waf1 mediates growth arrest and cellular senescence. Activation of Akt overcomes a G2–M cell-cycle checkpoint induced by DNA damage (39). Therefore, successful
blockage of cancer cells at G2–M phase should also be accompanied by the downregulation of Akt. Treatment of GS5 cells
with Z-TMS (1 mmol/L) resulted in signiﬁcant downregulation
of Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation without affecting total Akt
level (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Taken together, Z-TMS appears to induce
G2–M cell-cycle arrest by induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 and downregulation of Akt signaling.
Broad-spectrum antitumor activities of Z-TMS
Because Z-TMS inhibits Akt activation, the status and function
of its upstream regulator EGFR) was examined. Our interest in
EGFR investigation stems in part from the observation that

(DCLK1-RFP) and treated with Z-TMS (1 mmol/L, lane 3) or DMSO (lane 2) for 48 hours. NS5B levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis in the total
cell lysates. Lane 1, untreated control. E, Z-TMS inhibits HCVþDCLK1þ cell migration. The cells were treated with Z-TMS or DMSO as indicated in wound-healing assay.
The space between two broken yellow lines in each sample image indicates the extent of gap/wound. F, confocal microscopy of HCVþDCLK1þ cells (top)
after staining for a-tubulin (green) and nucleus (blue). Yellow, colocalization of RFP-DCLK1 (red) with microtubules (green). Unlike controls (top and middle),
bundling of microtubules and sequestration of DCLK1 in the microtubule bundles (yellow, extreme right, bottom) are evident in Z-TMS–treated cells.

erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, diminishes HCV entry into cells and
reduces HCV replication in a mouse model (20). Because of the
lack of an EGFR-mutant hepatoma model, we used a well-characterized erlotinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC)
H1975 cells that contains the T790M gatekeeper mutation in
EGFR to determine the effect of Z-TMS on these cells. As shown
in Fig. 5A, Z-TMS signiﬁcantly reduced survival of H1975 cells in
the 0.1 mmol/L to 1.0 mmol/L range within 48 hours, whereas
erlotinib failed to reduce cell survival even though it was fully
active against the wild-type EGFR kinase domain (aa 695–
1210; Fig. 5A and B). The luciferase-based EGFR activity assay
suggests that erlotinib efﬁciently inhibited (90%) the kinase
activities, whereas Z-TMS failed to exhibit strong inhibition in
spite of reducing H1975 survival. Confocal immunostaining
clearly revealed that only Z-TMS but not erlotinib induced micro-

tubule bundling (Fig. 5C, middle). Unlike the intense colocalization of DCLK1 with microtubules in DCLK1-overexpressing hepatoma cells (Fig. 2F), we observed mostly punctate staining of
DCLK1 in H1975 probably due to alternatively spliced or posttranslationally modiﬁed forms that do not preferentially bind
microtubules (Fig. 5C).
To understand the mechanism of Z-TMS–induced cell death,
H1975 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and treated with ZTMS (1 mmol/L) in quadruplets. After ﬁxing the cells, nuclei
were stained and the extent of nuclear fragmentation was
assessed. The data suggest that Z-TMS induces nuclear fragmentation in nearly 70% to 80% cells as compared with the
untreated or DMSO or cisplatin (50 mmol/L) treated controls
(Fig. 5D). Total lysates of H1975 cells treated with the drugs as
described above showed activation of autophagy markers,

LC3B-I and LC3B-II proteins in Z-TMS–treated cell lysate (Fig.
5E, lane 3), which were much higher than the corresponding
controls (lanes 1, 2 and 4). Similar Western blot analysis
suggested that only cisplatin, but not Z-TMS, induces cleaved
caspase-3 (Asp175), which marks cell death by apoptosis (Fig.
5F). Thus, Z-TMS appears to induce H1975 cell death by
autophagy and nuclear fragmentation.
Z-TMS protects liver from DEN/CCl4-induced injury, reduces
DCLK1þ cell number at injury sites, and promotes hepatic
recovery
The scheduled administration of DEN (one injection) followed by twice-weekly injections of carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4) induces liver injury that further progresses to ﬁbrosis
and HCC within 8 to 10 months (40–42). We treated immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with two DEN (25 mg/kg BW)
injections once a week followed by administration of CCl4 (1
mL/kg BW) alone or with Z-TMS (20 or 40 mg/kg BW) twice per
week for 7 weeks (groups 1 through 3 in Table 1; Fig. 6A). As
expected, the DEN/CCl4–treated mice developed liver injury
characterized by histologic perturbations and appearance of
nonepithelial cells in the parenchyma (Fig. 6A, extreme left
panels). These regions also exhibited unusually high numbers
of DCLK1þ cells with intense staining in epithelial and nonepithelial compartments at the injury sites (only two liver
sections from different mice of the same group are shown in
top and bottom). This observation suggests that DEN/CCl4–led
injury signiﬁcantly induces DCLK1 expression in liver
(highlighted in Fig. 6B). The untreated control (normal) mice
livers were largely negative for DCLK1 stain or occasionally
revealed a fewer DCLK1þ cells within portal triads (extreme
right). The mice treated with Z-TMS (groups 2 and 3), which
were simultaneously receiving DEN/CCL4 doses, exhibited
improved histologic appearance with signiﬁcantly reduced

number of DCLK1þ cells as compared with group 1 (DEN/
CCl4 treated, Fig. 6A). Both histologic and liver function panel
(ALB, ALT, AST, ALKP, and TBIL in Table 1) data clearly suggest
that Z-TMS alone (group 4) does not exhibit hepatotoxicity
under these treatment conditions. Instead, Z-TMS successfully
protected the liver from toxic agents and improved injury most
likely by eliminating or suppressing DCLK1þ cells. Mice in any
group did not lose their body weight.

Discussion
Viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, and metabolic disorders substantially contribute to the development of cirrhosis and primary HCC. End-stage liver disease due to chronic HCV infection is expected to remain a major health care issue in most
countries partly due to lack of effective treatment options or
inaccessibility to newly discovered drugs. Current HCC antineoplastic drugs, sorafenib alone or in combination with other
drugs, cause considerable toxicity and only improve median
overall survival by 3 months. Here, we have reported novel
properties of Z-TMS that exerts its antiviral and antitumor
activities by interference with the CSC marker DCLK1, microtubule dynamics, induction of autophagy, G2–M arrest and
nuclear fragmentation. The combined effects reﬂect in vitro
efﬁcacy of Z-TMS against the drug-resistant tumor cells such
as NSCLC. Z-TMS also promotes hepatic recovery from extensive DEN (genotoxic)/CCl4 (hepatotoxic) induced liver injury
in immunocompetent C57BL mice. Thus, Z-TMS may potentially block initiation and progression of HCC by targeting
DCLK1. This notion is also supported by our observation that
DCLK1 downregulation results in reduction of hepatoma-like
tumor growth (43). Although Z-TMS at doses 20 and 40 mg/Kg
BW did not exhibit hepatic toxicity, 20% mice showed complications in gastrointestinal emptying. These observations

warrant us for optimizing drug dosages and duration of treatment to gain its maximum health beneﬁts.
Using subgenomic replicons and full-length JFH1 infection
models of HCV, we have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of Z-TMS
against widely prevalent HCV genotypes 1 and 2. The magnetic
levitation experiments revealed that growth of HCV-expressing
spheroids/aggregates could also be effectively targeted by ZTMS. The heterogeneity of this cellular mass and cell-to-cell
contacts in the spheroids were revealed by immunohistochemical staining showing membranous CK19. It further showed
expected DCLK1þ subpopulations (usually 1%–2% of total
GS5 cells; ref. 15). Our in vivo experiments suggest that Z-TMS
can diminish the DCLK1þ population in injured livers. Because
DCLK1 appears to be involved in HCV replication and hepatic
malignancy (15, 16, 43), it is likely that Z-TMS will be able to
eliminate HCV-expressing cancer stem–like cells to prevent
progression of liver diseases.
Although normal liver parenchyma lacks detectable DCLK1
expression, DCLK1 expression and number of DCLK1þ cells are
increased signiﬁcantly in the stroma, regenerative cirrhotic
nodules, and HCC. Z-TMS clearly targeted DCLK1-microtubule
dynamics that promotes HCV replication, cell migration, and cellcycle progression. Microtubule-stabilizing drugs (paclitaxel and
docetaxel) and destabilizing drugs (vinblastine and nocodazole)
have been extensively used for the treatment of cancer (44, 45). A
few of these drugs have also been shown to hamper movement of
the HCV replication complexes required for viral replication (46).

By sequestering DCLK1 with bundled microtubules, Z-TMS will
block survival, proliferation, and division of DCLK1þ CSC cells.
Cancer/tumor stem cells (CSC) are key contributors of drug
resistance, metastasis, and recurrence of tumors. At present, effectively targeting CSCs for treatment is challenging (18, 19). We
previously demonstrated that HCV induces several CSC markers
(CD133, Lgr5, and c-Myc), including DCLK1 (47, 48). Our
current data revealed that DCLK1 overexpression in HCC-positive
patients considerably reduces survival rate. Z-TMS causes sequestration of DCLK1 with microtubule bundles accompanied by a
dramatic decrease in the NS5B polymerase level in HCVþDCLK1þ
hepatoma cells. Z-TMS appears to be effective against DCLK1positive CSCs. DCLK1 has been shown to play important roles in
the development of intestinal polyps, intestinal response to
radiation injury, cell survival, and control of metastasis. In addition, we have shown that DCLK1 positively regulates HCV replication in knockdown and overexpression systems. Thus, Z-TMS–
targeted elimination of HCV-positive cells bearing CSCs footprints is likely to beneﬁt patients with advanced liver diseases,
including HCC.
The molecular mechanisms of Z-TMS's antiproliferative effects
were also studied. We observed that Z-TMS treatment resulted in
G2–M arrest (95%) of hepatoma cells independent of HCV within
48 hours. Cell-cycle progression is orchestrated by cyclins and
cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). CyclinB1/CDK1 complex speciﬁcally regulates cell entry into mitosis, and enhances mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation for G2–M transition. In

accordance with these observations, we observed a considerable
decrease in total CDK1 and a concomitant increase in the cellcycle inhibitor, p21Cip/Waf1, following Z-TMS treatment. The
observed p21Cip/Waf1 induction after Z-TMS treatments resulted

in inhibition of CDK1 activities and cell-cycle arrest. Akt activation downstream of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway regulates multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, CSC survival, metabolism, angiogenesis, and proliferation. Phosphorylation of Akt at

Z-TMS protects liver from DEN/CCl4-induced injury by downregulating DCLK1 expression and promoting normal healing in C57BL mice. A, immunohistochemical
staining for DCLK1 (brown) in the liver of mice receiving DEN/CCl4 alone (group 1) or with Z-TMS (group 2, 3). Group 4 received only Z-TMS, whereas group 5
received no treatment (na€ve control). Each group had 5 mice kept under similar conditions. The representative staining results for two different mice
(1 and 2) within each group are shown. DEN/CCl4-induced liver injury sites (arrows) were highly enriched in DCLK1þ cells. However, similar areas had fewer or
no DCLK1þ cells following treatment with Z-TMS (groups 2 and 3). B, 60 images of the representative mice 1 and 2 [þDEN/CCl4 panel, group 1] showing
DCLK1þ cells with intense staining.

Ser473 by mTORC2 is required for its hyperactivation and stabilization of its active conformation. We observed a considerable
inhibition of Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation following Z-TMS
treatment. In addition, Z-TMS induced autophagy that was
accompanied by nuclear fragmentation. These properties are
especially desirable for the treatment of hard-to-treat drug-resistant cancers.
In conclusion, the results presented here collectively support Z-TMS as a unique potent anti-HCV and antitumor drug
that exerts its effects by targeting multiple pathways. Z-TMS
signiﬁcantly reduces DCLK1þ CSC populations during hepatic
injury, interferes with DCLK1-microtubule dynamics, arrests
cell cycle at G2–M phase, promotes autophagy, and causes
nuclear fragmentation. Thus, Z-TMS potentially overrides
NSCLC resistance to erlotinib because of its unique mechanisms of action.
