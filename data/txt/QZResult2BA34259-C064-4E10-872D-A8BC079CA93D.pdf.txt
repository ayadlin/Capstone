Abstract
Obesity is a signiﬁcant risk factor for cancer. A link between obesity and a childhood cancer has been
identiﬁed: obese children diagnosed with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had a 50% greater risk
of relapse than their lean counterparts. L-asparaginase (ASNase) is a ﬁrst-line therapy for ALL that breaks down
asparagine and glutamine, exploiting the fact that ALL cells are more dependent on these amino acids than
other cells. In the present study, we investigated whether adipocytes, which produce signiﬁcant quantities of
glutamine, may counteract the effects of ASNase. In children being treated for high-risk ALL, obesity was not
associated with altered plasma levels of asparagine or glutamine. However, glutamine synthetase was
markedly increased in bone marrow adipocytes after induction chemotherapy. Obesity substantially impaired
ASNase efﬁcacy in mice transplanted with syngeneic ALL cells and, like in humans, without affecting plasma
asparagine or glutamine levels. In coculture, adipocytes inhibited leukemic cell cytotoxicity induced by
ASNase, and this protection was dependent on glutamine secretion. These ﬁndings suggest that adipocytes
work in conjunction with other cells of the leukemia microenvironment to protect leukemia cells during
ASNase treatment. Cancer Res; 73(10); 2998–3006. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Obesity is associated with a substantial increase in cancer
incidence and mortality worldwide (1), with an estimated 20%
of cancers in the United States due to obesity (2). In addition to
increasing cancer incidence, obesity appears to decrease survival from some cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; refs. 3, 4). This impaired survival appears to be a
direct effect of obesity, and not due to increased risk of
treatment complications or toxicities (3). The mechanisms
linking obesity to cancer still remain elusive (5). In vivo and in
vitro models developed in our laboratory (6) have shown that
obesity impairs the efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutics against ALL
cells, likely mediated by adipocytes. As leukemia affects 2,000
children (7) and more than 40,000 adults per year in the United
States (8), understanding and reversing the associations
between obesity and leukemia relapse could prevent signiﬁcant cancer mortality.

L-asparaginase (ASNase) is a cornerstone of childhood ALL
treatment (9), with growing application in adult chemotherapy
regimens (10). ASNase hydrolyzes the amino acids asparagine
(ASN) and glutamine (GLN) to aspartic acid and glutamic acid,
respectively (11). In the United States, the most commonly
used form of the enzyme, from Escherichia coli (E. coli), has a
100 times greater substrate speciﬁcity for ASN compared with
GLN (12). Because ALL cells depend on ASN and GLN for
survival and proliferation (11,13), ASNase efﬁcacy depends on
the depletion of ASN and GLN from the leukemia microenvironment (14,15). As adipose tissue is a major contributor to the
whole-body GLN pool (16), obesity may impair GLN depletion.
Moreover, it has been proposed that nonmalignant cells might
support leukemia cells during ASNase treatment through local
secretion of amino acids (17), an idea that has been further
explored more recently (18–21).
Here, we report that adipocytes, which are abundant in the
bone marrow and contribute to the protective leukemia
microenvironment (6), produce both ASN and GLN, which
could protect nearby leukemia cells from ASNase.

Materials and Methods
Human subjects
Bone marrow biopsy and blood samples were obtained from
19 patients, 10 to 18 years old before and during treatment for
high-risk leukemia. Obesity was deﬁned as a BMI greater than
or equal to the 95th percentile according to Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention guidelines. All patients were treated
according to the high-risk CCG/COG protocol, involving a
4-drug induction regimen including 4 weeks of steroids and
PEG ASNase (25,000 IU/m2, single dose either intramuscularly

or intravenously). Samples were obtained after written
informed consent and assent were obtained, under a protocol
approved by the CHLA Committee on Clinical Investigation
(Institutional Review Board). Characteristics of the study
population are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell lines and culture
The 3T3-L1 cells from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) were differentiated into adipocytes as previously
described (6), and used for experiments between days þ7 and
þ14 of differentiation. Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 ﬁbroblasts
were irradiated and plated at conﬂuence. The bone marrowderived mesenchymal cell line, OP9, was differentiated into
adipocytes in a similar manner.
Murine pre-B ALL cells were previously isolated from a BCR/
ABL transgenic mouse (8093 cells; ref. 22). Human leukemia cell
lines were obtained from the ATCC and the German Collection
of Cell Lines (DSMZ), and included BV173 (Pre B Phþ ALL),
K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), Molt-4 (T cell leukemia), Nalm-6 (B cell precursor leukemia), RCH-ACV (pre-B ALL
with an E2A-PBX1 fusion protein), RS4;11 (pre-B t(4;11) ALL),
SD-1 (pre-B Phþ ALL), SEM (B cell precursor), and SupB15 (B
cell precursor).
Primary human leukemia cells were passaged in NOD.CgPrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjll/SzJ mice (Jackson Laboratories) and harvested from the spleens of these mice and cultured on irradiated OP9 feeder layers for all experiments. These cells were
kindly provided by Markus M€
uschen, Yong-Mi Kim, and Nora
Heisterkamp (23). These cells are, hereafter, referred to as
human leukemia cells. US7 and US7R were from a Ph-negative
patient before and after the patient developed relapse. TXL-2
and BLQ-1 ALL cells were Ph-positive and taken from patients
at diagnosis.
Asparagine/glutamine-free (AGF) media was prepared with
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and 10% dialyzed FBS. FBS was dialyzed against 100 volumes of PBS 3
times, using 3kDa SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis conﬁrmed removal of all amino acids.
To determine ASN or GLN dependence, cells were plated
onto 96-well plates in AGF media alone, with 2 mmol/L GLN,
with 400 mmol/L ASN, or with both amino acids. After 72 hours,
cell growth was measured using resazurin (R&D Systems).
Experiments with human leukemia cells were conducted over
OP9 feeder layers and cells counted by a blinded observer using
trypan blue after vigorous trituration to remove cells within
and below the feeder layers.
In vivo leukemia model
Ten thousand 8093 cells were injected retro-orbitally into 46
diet-induced obese (DIO; raised on 60% of calories from fat
diet) and 42 nonobese (raised on 10% of calories from fat)
C57Bl6/j mice (Jackson Laboratories). Seven to 10 days after
implantation, mice were treated with ASNase or vehicle,
proportional to body weight (3,000 IU/kg/day, 5 days/week
via intraperitoneal injection  3 weeks, Elspar; Ovation Pharmaceuticals). Additional experiments were conducted with
pegylated ASNase (3,000 IU/kg/week  3 weeks; Enzon Phar-

maceuticals). Animals were euthanized upon development of
progressive leukemia (weight loss >10%, paralysis, hunched
posture, or palpable mass > 1 cm). Additional transplanted and
treated mice underwent cardiac perfusion with heparinized
saline under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia for analysis of
tissue ASN synthetase (ASNS) and glutamine synthetase (GS)
levels. Fat pads were collected, weighed, snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 80 C. All animal studies were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Coculture experiments
Leukemia cells were cultured with ﬁbroblasts, adipocytes,
or no feeder layer. In experiments of drug resistance, ASNase
was added to achieve an approximate IC50. After 72 hours, cells
were counted as above. In additional experiments, 8093 cells
were cultured in 0.4-mm pore size TransWells (Corning, Inc.)
separated from the feeder layers. To inhibit GS, adipocytes
were treated overnight with 1.5 mmol/L methionine sulfoximine (MSO), and washed 3 times before experiments. Complete
GS inhibition was conﬁrmed by HPLC measurement of GLN
secretion. Erwinase investigational drug was kindly provided
for experimental evaluations by Dr. Paul Plourde (Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Langhorne, Pennsylvania), and used at a dose with
equivalent asparagine-deamination activity, as determined
by Nessler's reaction (24). The 8093 cells in TransWells were
analyzed for cell cycle and apoptosis after 48 hours in culture
by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation (BD Biosciences) on a FACScan (BD Biosciences, CellQuest software).
Amino acid analysis and sample preparation
To measure amino acid secretion, feeder layers were cultured in 24 well plates as described earlier, washed with PBS
twice, then cultured in 1 mL per well of AGF media. Media was
collected, ﬁltered through 0.45-mm syringe ﬁlters, and snap
frozen. All samples were stored at 80 C until assay.
Tissue explant amino acid production was measured using
fat pads from perfused mice. Fat was cut into approximately 50
mg pieces, washed thoroughly with PBS, and placed in 24-well
culture plates with 1 mL AGF media for conditioning.
Blood was sampled from the submandibular plexus of
unanesthetized mice into BD EDTA-coated Microtainer tubes,
cooled to 4 C to prevent ex vivo deamination, spun at 13,000g,
and the plasma obtained was snap frozen.
Murine plasma and conditioned media amino acid measurements were carried out as previously described (25) with slight
modiﬁcations. Samples were deproteinized using 20% 5-sulfosalicylic acid containing 1.0 mmol/L L-Norleucine (internal
standard, Sigma). Samples were dried in a speedvac, resuspended with a derivatization reagent (methanol, TEA, H20, and
PITC at 7:1:1:1 ratios) and dried again. Samples were measured
using a Waters 1525 Binary HPLC pump and absorbance was
detected at 254 nm.
Clinical plasma amino acid samples were measured in the
clinical laboratory. Brieﬂy, samples were deproteinized with 5sulfosalicylic acid followed by addition of NG-methylarginine.
On-line derivatization was carried out using mixture solution
of o-phthaladehyde and 3-mercaptopropionic acid. After derivatization and neutralization, 5 mL was injected to HPLC.

Separation was carried out on a Synergi 4U Fusion RP80A C18
column (110  4.6 mmol/L) with guard column (2 Fusion-RP
4.0  3.0 mm; both from Phenomenex) using a ﬂuorescence
detector by their native ﬂuorescence at lEX: 340 nm, lEM: 455
nm
Western blotting
Protein was extracted from leukemia cells, cultured adipocytes, and fat tissue from perfused mice as previously described
(6) Cell lysates were separated on Novex Tris-Glycine precast
gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.2 mm nitrocellulose
membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were then incubated
with a mouse anti-GS monoclonal antibody (Abcam), a rabbit
anti-ASNS polyclonal antibody (Abcam), or rabbit anti-GAPDH
antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody from
Cell Signaling Technologies. Membranes were developed using
the HyGLO HRP detection kit (Denville). To allow intergel
comparison of fat-pad Western blots, K562 cell lysates (positive
for ASNS, GS, and GAPDH) were run on all gels and used to
correct for exposure time and run variances. Band intensity
was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/
ij/).
Immunohistochemistry
Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed bone marrow samples were
embedded with parafﬁn, sliced, and mounted by the CHLA
Pathology Core. Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval
with Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, with steam for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidases were inactivated with 3% H2O2. Nonspeciﬁc
staining was blocked with 2.5% normal goat serum before
staining with rabbit anti-mouse GS or ASNS (Abcam), and
detected with the ImmPRESS reagent (Vector Laboratories
Inc.) containing polymerized peroxidase labeled goat antirabbit immunoglobulin (mouse adsorbed). The reaction was
detected with ImmPACT DAB (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and
counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Images were
acquired on a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope (40/1.3) with a
SPOT QE Color Digital Camera.
Statistical analysis
Body weights were compared with unpaired, 2-sided t tests.
Survival curves were generated by Kaplan–Meier Life Tables,
and compared using Cox Proportional Hazards. Each coculture
experiment was conducted on different days or using different
cell thaws, and the averages of 3 triplicate wells for each
condition in each experiment were calculated. Paired t tests
were used to compare number of viable leukemia cells over the
various feeder layers. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Adipocytes in the leukemia microenvironment produce
glutamine
We and others have previously found that obesity worsens treatment outcome in adolescents with high-risk ALL
(3, 4). To test whether obesity might impair ASNase efﬁcacy,
we measured plasma levels of amino acids in adolescents

3000

before and after induction chemotherapy for high-risk
ALL, which included a single dose of PEG-ASNase. There
were no signiﬁcant differences in amino acid levels between
obese and lean subjects, with ASN being fully suppressed
by ASNase, and GLN largely unaffected in both groups
(Fig. 1A).
Because plasma amino acid levels might not reﬂect conditions in the leukemia microenvironment, we examined
bone marrow biopsy specimens from 4 obese and 4 lean
adolescent leukemia patients for expression of ASNS and GS,
the rate-limiting steps for ASN and GLN production. Cells
positive for ASNS were found throughout the marrow, and
expression appeared unaltered after treatment (Fig. 1B).
Before treatment, GS expression was low and appeared to
be localized in scattered adipocytes. After treatment, there
was a large increase in the area occupied by adipocytes, as
has been previously shown (26), together with an apparent
increase of GS in these cells.
Obesity impairs L-asparaginase efﬁcacy in mice
To test whether obesity per se can cause ASNase resistance, we implanted diet-induced obese (DIO; 41.5  4.4 g)
and nonobese (30.4  2.0 g; P < 0.001) male mice with
syngeneic leukemia cells at 20  2 weeks of age (6). ASNase,
administered proportional to body weight, prolonged survival in nonobese mice over vehicle (33.4  12.0 vs. 26.6  5.6
days, P < 0.01), but yielded no detectible survival beneﬁt to
obese mice (26.4  7.5 days, P < 0.0001 vs. non-obese, P ¼ n.s.
vs. vehicle; Fig. 2A). There was no difference in survival
between vehicle-treated nonobese and obese mice (28  4.5
vs. 26  4.2, data not shown). Obesity similarly decreased
survival after treatment with the more stable pegylated form
of ASNase (P < 0.05 obese vs. nonobese; Fig. 2B). Plasma
amino acid levels showed a similar pattern to that of
humans, with no differences between diet groups (Fig.
2C). Nor was there any signiﬁcant difference between plasma ASNase activity following a single dose of E. coli ASNase
between diet groups, although obese mice tended to have
higher levels than nonobese mice (Fig. 2D). Thus, similar to
humans, obese mice exhibited impaired leukemia outcome
with no signiﬁcant differences in plasma ASN or GLN.
Unlike in humans, we did not observe a change in bone
marrow GS expression in mice treated with ASNase (Supplementary Fig. S1). Likewise, although GS was dramatically
higher in 3T3-L1 adipocytes than in undifferentiated 3T3-L1
cells, as has been previously shown (27), expression of ASNS
and GS appeared to decrease following 72 hours of culture in
ASN- and GLN-depleted (AGF) media (Fig. 2E). We, therefore,
considered whether the increase in GS found in human samples could be caused by another chemotherapy given during
induction. Indeed, dexamethasone increased 3T3-L1 adipocyte
GS levels approximately 2-fold, as has been shown in other
studies (28).
As we have shown that ALL cells inﬁltrate adipose tissue
during treatment (6), we next investigated GS expression in
adipose tissue. Mouse adipose tissue expressed detectible GS,
but not ASNS, by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2F). Furthermore,
fat tissue explants from wild-type C57 mice secreted GLN

Adipocytes protect leukemia cells from ASNase via GLN
production
To determine whether adipocytes could protect ALL cells
from ASNase, we cultured 8093 murine ALL cells over
irradiated 3T3-L1 ﬁbroblast-like cells or differentiated
3T3-L1 adipocytes, in media with 1 IU/mL ASNase. The
3T3-L1 adipocytes protected ALL cells from ASNase both
with and without direct contact (Fig. 3A). A similar pattern
was observed with adipocytes differentiated from OP9 bone
marrow mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3B). Adipocyte protection
was associated with decreased apoptosis and increased cell
cycling during ASNase exposure (Fig. 3C; Supplementary
Fig. S3).
As adipocytes produce both ASN and GLN, we next tested
whether either of these amino acids were responsible for
adipocyte protection of ALL cells from ASNase. Twice-daily
addition of ASN had no effect on ASNase cytotoxicity (Fig. 4A),
whereas GLN supplementation partially blocked ASNase cytotoxicity (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment with MSO, an irreversible
inhibitor of GS, rendered adipocytes unable to protect ALL
cells from ASNase (Fig. 4C). Similarly, use of Erwinase, a form
of asparaginase with 5-fold greater glutaminase activity than

3002

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

E. coli ASNase (12), was able to inhibit the protective effect of
adipocytes (Fig. 4D).
Adipocytes also protected human leukemia cell lines from
both ASNase (not shown), and media lacking ASN and GLN
(AGF media; Fig. 4E). To determine which amino acids human
leukemia cells were sensitive to, we cultured 10 leukemia cell
lines in media lacking ASN, GLN, or both (Fig. 5A). Only 3 of 10
human leukemia cell lines were sensitive to removal of ASN

from the media, while 8 of 10 were sensitive to GLN removal. All
lines tested were most sensitive to removal of both amino
acids. In similar tests with 4 human leukemia cells (BLQ1, Txl2,
US7, and US7R; ref. 23), 1 line was sensitive to ASN removal, 3
were sensitive to GLN removal, and all 4 were sensitive to
removal of both amino acids (Fig. 5B). Sensitivity to either
amino acid could not be explained by ASNS or GS expression
(Fig. 5C; ref. 29).

Discussion
Although obesity has been recognized as a major factor in
leukemia progression and relapse, the precise mechanism(s)

by which obesity impairs treatment outcome remains unclear.
In order to elucidate the role of obesity in leukemia treatment,
we have investigated the use of the front-line chemotherapy
L-asparaginase, which despite its use clinically for over 50 years,
is still being studied to determine ideal treatment strategies.
Several studies have shown improved patient outcome with
more intense or longer treatment with ASNase (30, 31), while
insufﬁcient drug exposure, as in the case of silent hypersensitivity, is associated with higher risk of relapse (32). ASNase
cytotoxicity relies on its ability to deplete ASN and GLN from
plasma. This effectively starves lymphoid cells, which unlike
most other cells are unable to sustain themselves through de
novo production (11). Effective use of ASNase has traditionally
been measured by the depletion of plasma ASN and GLN, or its
surrogate, plasma asparaginase activity (33).
In our murine leukemia model, ASNase treatment was less
effective in obese mice than nonobese mice. Notably, there was
no signiﬁcant difference in plasma amino acid levels between
obese and nonobese mice at any timepoint, despite the dramatic difference in survival. Regardless of diet group, plasma
ASN remained suppressed, while GLN began to recover within
12 hours. Similarly, in patient samples, GLN did not appear
suppressed, although early timepoints were not sampled in this
study. Although a rebound effect was found in other studies
(34), its mechanism is unknown and may be the result of an
increase in endogenous GLN synthesis or release of tissue GLN
during cachexia. We documented a dramatic increase in GS in
bone marrow collected from ALL patients at the end of
induction, but not in adipose tissue or bone marrow following
ASNase treatment in mice. Although it is possible that
this difference results from species-speciﬁc response to ASN
and/or GLN depletion in the plasma, it is more likely that it
results from the use of combination chemotherapy in human
ALL. In particular, glucocorticoids have been shown to induce
GS in some tissues (28), and we found that dexamethasone
treatment induced an increase in GS protein levels in 3T3-L1
adipocytes. The potential for glucocorticoid induction of GS to
impair ASNase efﬁcacy, particularly in the context of the tumor
microenvironment, may be the target of future studies.
GLN is the most abundant amino acid in plasma, and
necessary for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis. Although
a nonessential amino acid, a variety of human cancer cell lines,
including pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, small cell lung
cancer, and leukemia have been shown to be highly dependent
on GLN for proliferation and survival (35). GLN depletion can
induce apoptosis in cancer cells, with a higher selectivity than
glucose depletion (36). In addition, leukemia cells adapt to
ASNase treatment by increasing synthesis and transport of
GLN, and inhibition of GS has been shown to resensitize
resistant leukemia lines to ASNase (37). These studies highlight
the possibility of targeting GLN metabolism to combat ASNase
resistance. However, studies aimed at systemic inhibition of
GLN metabolism have been limited due to toxicity (38, 39).
Using our in vitro system we found that adipocytes protect
leukemia cells both from L-asparaginase and from ASN/GLN
starvation, primarily through secretion of GLN. As adipose
tissue secretes signiﬁcant amounts of GLN into interstitial
ﬂuid (40), and, as we have previously shown, leukemia cells

inﬁltrate adipose tissue (6), it is possible that adipose tissue is a
sanctuary where ALL cells are protected from ASNase activity.
This may also happen in the bone marrow after initiation of
chemotherapy, when the number of adipocytes and their
expression of GS both increase dramatically. As obese patients
have large amounts of body fat, it might increase the probability that the adipocyte-mediated protection from ASNase
may become clinically relevant, and be one of the factors
leading to increased relapse rate in obese ALL patients.
Our results complement the recent ﬁnding that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSC) protect leukemia from
ASNase treatment through ASN secretion (19–21). Laranjeira
and colleagues showed that leukemia-cell secretion of IGFBP-7
increased ASN synthesis by stromal cells (21). Interestingly,
this effect was further increased by the addition of insulin and
IGF-1, both of which are elevated in obesity (41).
Two recent publications have questioned the role of bone
marrow MSCs as a source of ASN during ASNase treatment in
patients (42, 43). These studies found that, upon treatment, the
extent of depletion of ASN and GLN were similar in the bone
marrow and the peripheral blood. Interestingly, both studies
showed higher aspartic acid concentrations in the marrow

than in the peripheral blood, possibly indicating either high
rates of de novo aspartic acid production or a greater turnover
of ASN in the microenvironment. Further investigation into the
extent to which known sanctuary sites may counteract the
depletion of ASN and GLN from blood should be carried out. In
particular, it is possible that tissues with poor capillarization,
such as adipose tissue in obese patients (44), may provide an
environment more removed from ASNase treatment.
Several groups have been developing alternative ASNase
preparations with lower glutaminase activity (45–47). The goal
is minimizing the side effects associated with GLN starvation
such as immunosuppression and pancreatitis. One study
looked into the possibility of supplementing the diet of rats
treated with ASNase with alanyl-glutamine to counteract the
immunosuppressive effects of GLN depletion (34). In our study,
8 out of 9 commercial cell lines and 4 out of 4 human leukemia
cells were more sensitive to GLN than ASN starvation and, in
nearly all cases, depletion of both amino acids had a stronger
effect than either amino acid individually. These results are in
line with a study conducted by Offman (47), who showed that,
in their recombinant ASNase, some cell lines responded better
to wild-type ASNase than an asparaginase with decreased

glutaminase activity. In addition, we have shown here that
Erwinase, a form of L-asparaginase with higher glutaminase
activity commonly used in cases of allergy to E. coli L -asparaginase, was able to impair the ability of adipocytes to protect
leukemia cells in vitro. These ﬁndings suggest that strategies to
develop alternative ASNase preparations with lower glutaminase activity may, in fact, be detrimental to the cytotoxicity of
ASNase and should be done with caution.
Our ﬁndings highlight that new treatment regimens using
ASNase preparations should not only focus on the suppression
of plasma ASN and GLN levels, but also on the effectiveness of
the drug on the cancer microenvironment. Adipose tissue may
have a key role to maintain a leukemia cell population during
ASNase treatment. Given the rising prevalence of obesity
worldwide, pharmacologic strategies aimed to modulate adipocyte effects on malignant cells might become important in
cancer treatment.
