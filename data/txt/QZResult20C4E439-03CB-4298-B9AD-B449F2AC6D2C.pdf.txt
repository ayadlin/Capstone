ABSTRACT
The adenoviral gene E1a is known to enhance the antitumor effect of cisplatin,
one of the cornerstones of the current cancer chemotherapy. Here we study the
molecular basis of E1a mediated sensitivity to cisplatin in an experimental model
of Non-small cell lung cancer. Our data show how E1a blocks the induction of
autophagy triggered by cisplatin and promotes the apoptotic response in resistant
cells. Interestingly, at the molecular level, we present evidences showing how the
phosphatase MKP1 is a major determinant of cisplatin sensitivity and its upregulation
is strictly required for the induction of chemosensitivity mediated by E1a. Indeed,
E1a is almost unable to promote sensitivity in H460, in which the high expression of
MKP1 remains unaffected by E1a. However, in resistant cell as H1299, H23 or H661,
which display low levels of MKP1, E1a expression promotes a dramatic increase in the
amount of MKP1 correlating with cisplatin sensitivity. Furthermore, effective knock
down of MKP1 in H1299 E1a expressing cells restores resistance to a similar extent
than parental cells.
In summary, the present work reinforce the critical role of MKP1 in the cellular
response to cisplatin highlighting the importance of this phosphatase in future gene
therapy approach based on E1a gene.

INTRODUCTION

chemo/radiosensitivity [10, 11]. It is also known that this
adenoviral protein is able to induce p53 stabilization [12]
through binding to Mdm4, rendering Mdm2 inhibition
and decreasing nuclear export and degradation of p53
[13]. However, the chemosensitizer ability of E1a also
has been reported to be p53 independent [14]. On the
other hand, the effect exerted onto other critical tumor
suppressors genes has been also proposed to be involved
in E1a-induced chemosensitization, such p19ARF [12]
or pRb. [15] In addition, proapoptotic protein as Bax and
Caspase-9 [16–18] that ordinarily promotes cell death,
could account for E1a associated sensitivity. It is also
noteworthy that some of the biological properties of E1a
are related to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
signaling pathways. E1a is known to interfere with the

The adenoviral protein E1a was primary described as
an oncogene able to induce transformation in cooperation
with other oncogenes such as Ras or Myc [1]. However,
E1a also has an antitumor effect exerted by different
mechanism as reversing the transformed phenotype,
inhibiting metastasis, or inducing apoptosis in different
experimental models [2–4] (for a review see [5]). From the
therapeutic point of view is well stablished that E1a is able
to promote radio/chemosensitivity [6–9]. In this regard,
the ability of the adenoviral protein to induce sensitivity
could be explained by different mechanisms. For
example, the loss of function in the PI3K/AKT pathway
has been proposed to be a key step in the induction of

p38 pathway in response to different stimuli such as UV,
chemo and radiotherapy playing an important role the
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway through the protein
phosphatase PP2A [11, 19]. In addition, E1a is able to
block ERK1/2 activation in fibroblast in the presence
of v-H-Ras by increasing the levels of MKP1, a nuclear
phosphatase for MAPK, explaining the ability of E1a to
escape from Ras induced senescence [20]. Finally, E1a is
also know to affect JNK in a Rac upstream manner but
no phosphatase has been implicated in this case [21].
Nonetheless, all the previous suggest the important role
that MAPKs and protein phosphatases could play in many
of the biological properties controlled by E1a.
Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a
subtype of lung cancer, with a high ratio of refractory
patients to the current therapy in which platin compounds
are one of the cornerstones (for a review see [22]).
Nonetheless, new approaches have been proposed to
overcome cisplatin (cDDP) resistance, such as the use of
glytazonas or copper chelators [23–25], aimed to improve
platin based therapy, allowing a more selective use of the
drug and avoiding some of the side effects. Interestingly
an increase in the activity of the MAPKs has been linked
with a more malignant phenotype. [26, 27]. In this regard,
expression of MKP1, which is a key element to control
the status of MAPKs pathways [28], has been shown to
correlate with an improved survival for lung cancer [29].
In this scenario, we decided to study how E1a could
promote chemosensitivity to cDDP in a panel of four
NSCLC cell lines. Our results show how E1a, through
the modulation of MKP1, promotes sensitivity in NSCLC
derived cell lines, indicating that evaluation of MKP1
could be a key element for future E1a gene-therapy
protocols in order to exploit the chemosensitizer properties
of this gene.

chemosensitivity phenotype even in the most resistant
model, such as H1299 cells (Supplementary Figure S2).
To normalize the cytotoxic effect of cDDP in our
panel of NSCLC we calculated the specific IC75, according
to the data obtained at 48 hours, for each parental cell line
in response to cDDP. Then we performed time course
assays from 24 up to 120 hours (Figure 1C). As expected,
we found that sensitivity associated to E1a was clear in
H1299, H23 and H661 compared with H460, in which E1a
associated sensitivity to cDDP was again almost marginal.
As a result, we decide to study how E1a was
affecting cell death mechanism triggered by cDDP in
H1299 cells. As it is shown, (Figure 2A and 2B) E1a
was able to promote an apoptotic response and blocks
the induction of the characteristic autophagic response
of resistant cells. Indeed, the use of QVD, a pan-caspase
inhibitor [31], promotes a marked increase in the resistance
of E1a expressing cells, but almost did not modify the
response of the control cells (as it Figure 2C). Finally,
autophagic flux was evaluated by using chloroquine [32].
As shown in Figure 2D, while in E1a expressing cells
LC3 lipidation remains almost unaffected by the presence
of chloroquine, non-expressing counterparts showed a
marked increase in the lipidation of LC3, being consistent
with a deregulation of the autophagic flux by the presence
of E1a.
In summary, this set of data indicates that E1a is able
to promote sensitivity by enhancing an apoptotic response
to cDDP and blocking the characteristic induction of
autophagy in our experimental model of H1299 cells.

Sensitivity to cDDP correlates with MKP1
expression in NSCLC
Cellular response to cDDP has been connected with
MAPKs signaling pathway (for a review see [33]). Among
the several mechanisms to control MAPKs activity, protein
phosphatases as MKP1 and DUSP5 are known targets
of E1a [20]. Therefore, we decided to study the role of
protein phosphatases in the chemosensitizer effect exerted
by E1a in response to cDDP. Initially, we correlated the
response of parental cell lines to cDDP (Figure 3A) with
the expression levels by qRT-PCR of DUSP5 and MKP1
(Figure 3B and 3C). As it is shown, different levels of
intrinsic resistance showed a nice correlation with MKP1,
but not with DUSP5. Next we validated this data by
checking protein levels of MKP1 in our panel of NSCLC
derived cell lines, showing again a nice correlation
(Figure 3D). Furthermore, although we failed to detect
JNK phosphorylation (data not shown), we found that
the expression level of MKP1 nicely correlated with p38
and ERK1/2 pathways activation in basal conditions,
indicating the functionality of MKP1 expression [34].
To fully probe the role of MKP1 in the cellular
response to cDDP in our NSCLC derived cell lines model,
we decided to knockdown MKP1 in H460 cell line. After

RESULTS
E1a enhances the antitumor effect of cDDP in
NSCLC trough promotion of apoptosis
In order to study the E1a mediated sensitivity to
cDDP we decided to use an experimental model comprised
of 4 NSCLC derived cell lines with different genetic
backgrounds (H460, H23, H661 and H1299) [30]. Cells
were infected with lentivirus carrying the adenoviral
gene E1a (isoform 13s) and resistance to cDDP was
evaluated. After achieving a successful expression of E1a
in our cell lines (Figure 1A), cells were exposed to the
indicated doses of cDDP during 48 hours. E1a was able
to increase the sensitivity to cDDP in all cell lines, being
maximum in H1299 cells. However, H460 cells showed
a minimum effect as judged by crystal violet (Figure 1B)
and confirmed by MTT assay (Supplementary Figure S1).
Furthermore, the induction of chemosensitivity was also
evaluated for the E1a 12s isoform, promoting again a

Upregulation of MKP1 mediates E1a associated
sensitivity to cDDP

achieve an effective knock down at the mRNA and protein
level (Figure 4A and 4B), we found that MKP1 abrogation
induce resistance to cDDP (Figure 4C), supporting the
key role of MKP1 in cDDP sensitivity. Furthermore,
we also performed an alternative approach generating a
H460 resistant cell line by continuous exposure to cDDP.
Interestingly this new cell line showed a marked decrease
in the levels of this phosphatase that correlates again with
resistance (Figure 4D and 4E).

Next, we tested whether MKP1 protein levels, in our
model of NSCLC, were affected by E1a gene. As shown
in Figure 5A, all the resistant cell lines showed a clear
increase in the levels of MKP1 in the presence of E1a,
except for H460 cells in which the presence of E1a did
not modify the expression level of MKP1. Functionality
of MKP1 alteration was evaluated by means of p38MAPK
phosphorylation, showing a marked decrease except in
H460 cells (Figure 5A).
To fully support our observations, we decided to
abrogate MKP1 function in H1299 E1a expressing cells.
Initially we tried some pharmacological approaches based
on Ro 31–8220 [35] but renders an unacceptable toxicity

Therefore, all these evidences support a critical role
for MKP1 in the cellular response to cDDP, demonstrating
how high levels of MKP1 correlate with sensitivity, while
its suppression promotes resistance and suggesting that
could be a potential mechanism to explain E1a associated
chemosensitivity.

in our experimental model (Supplementary Figure S3).
Therefore, we decided to use a genetic approach based
on shRNA. As shown in Figure 5B and 5C, we achieved
an effective knock down at the RNA and protein levels
for MKP1 in E1a expressing cells, which again correlated
with basal activation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways, (Figure 5D) and restored resistance similar to
control cells (Figure 5E).
Finally, to fully clarify the role of MAPKs in the
chemosensitizer effect of E1a we took advantage of the
specific inhibitors for both MAPK signaling pathway
affected by E1a, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, such as
PD98059 and SB203580 [36, 37]. To this end, E1a
expressing and non-expressing cells were incubated in the
presence or absence of MAPK inhibitors with increased
doses of cDDP. As shown (Figure 5F), the ERK1/2
signaling pathway inhibitor did not modify significantly
the response to cDDP, regardless the presence or absence
of E1a. However, SB203580 (Figure 5G) promoted an
increase in the sensitivity of E.V. that was not observed in
E1a positive cells.
Taken together, these data indicate that, in E1a
NSCLC expressing cells, upregulation of MKP1 and
the subsequent p38MAPK inhibition is required for the
induction of chemosensitivity to cDDP. In addition, the
present data also suggest that ERK1/2 signaling pathway
is not directly implicated in the chemosensitizer effect
associated to E1a

as new universal chemosensitizer agent in lung cancer,
especially in those cases with alterations in key genes
that show an acute resistance. In addition, we consider
that the evaluation of MKP1 expression, in agreement
with previous reports that support the use of MKP1 as a
biomarker in different types of tumors, [29, 46] could be
key point in a future therapy based on E1a.
Regarding to MKP1 our data support how this
phosphatase is a key player in the cellular response to cDDP
and how cells with low levels of MKP1 have an intrinsic
resistance to cDDP. In this sense, previous evidence
supported MKP1 down-modulation as a mechanism
to induce drug sensitivity in NSCLC [34, 47–49].
However in our experimental model of NSCLC we
observed that low endogenous levels of MKP1 correlates
with a marked “de novo” resistance. In agreement with
this observation, E1a increases the level of MKP1 to
promote sensitivity. In addition is noteworthy that E1a
is not only affecting MKP1 dependent signaling, other
pathways, as the PI3K/AKT pathway [10], could be
modulated by E1a to account for the chemosensitive
phenotype observed. In this regard, considering that
MAPKs are the natural substrates of MKP1, our data
support a role for p38MAPK in the chemosensitizer
effect of E1a. Indeed, the p38MAPK signaling pathway,
also known to be a target of E1a, is related to cDDP
response [11, 19] and is noteworthy that recent evidence
supports that the inhibition of p38MAPK is able to
promote sensitivity to cDDP [50], in agreement with our
observation in the context of E1a expression. However
our data do not support a direct implication of the
ERK1/2 in the chemosensitizer effect of E1a, in spite of
being a signaling pathway targeted by E1a [20, 51] and
related to cDDP resistance [52, 53]. Nonetheless, other
mechanisms should be considered to fully explain the
role of MKP1 in the cellular response to cDDP in the
presence of E1a. For example, it is well stablished that
NF-kb inhibition mediates chemosensitivity [54, 55] and
its activation correlates with resistance [56]. Interestingly,
NF-kb pathway is also targeted by E1a [57] and recent
evidences showed an inverse correlation between MKP1
expression and NF-kb activity [58] which could account
for our observations in E1a associated sensitivity.
Furthermore, possibilities as deregulation in proteins like
RIP [59] could account for the chemosensitizer effect of
E1a if mediated trough NF-kb, especially considering
the relationship between E1a and the JNK signaling
pathway [21]. Therefore, further studies are required to
fully elucidate the mechanism affected by E1a to promote
cDDP sensitivity. In addition, is interesting to mention
how the upregulation of MKP1 has been considered as
a critical step in novel therapeutic approaches for lung
cancer, as in the case of K-Ras driven lung carcinogenesis
and γ-secretase [60].
Finally is important to mention that E1a is able to
promote cDDP sensitivity trough an increase in apoptosis,

DISCUSSION
Several conclusions can be drawn from the present
report.
First, E1a is able to promote sensitivity to cDDP in
different models of NSCLC. This observation increases
the list of tumor models in which E1a is able to induce
chemosensitivity to cDDP as in the case of Squamous Cell
Carcinoma or Ovarian cancer. [6, 38] Furthermore, this
observation reinforces the universal character of E1a as
therapeutic agent regardless of the tumor type. In addition,
our observations indicate how E1a is able to promote
chemosensitivity in different experimental models with
different genetic patterns [30]. In this sense the tumor
suppressor p53 has been considered as a master gene in the
cellular response to cDDP since almost 20 years ago [39]
with clinical implications as a bio marker for resistance
to cDDP in lung cancer as well as in other pathologies
[40–42]. Our data in H1299 cells, with a genetic lack
of p53 gene, support the use of E1a as chemosensitizer
agent in the presence of non-functional p53, which could
account up to for 50% of human tumors. Even more, other
genetic hallmarks of lung cancer such as mutant K-Ras
[43], known to been implicated in cDDP resistance [44],
seem to be not implicated in the effect exerted by E1a,
as the data in H23 cell line, with a mutant K-Ras gene
[45], indicates. Therefore, our data supports the use of E1a

that correlates with a blockage of the autophagic
response associated to cDDP resistance [61, 62].
This issue raises the possibility that E1a could be a novel
negative modulator of autophagy associated to cDDP
by promoting apoptosis. However, it has been proposed
that E1a plus E1b are required for adenovirus associated
autophagy [63]. In this sense our data show how cells
expressing only E1a showed an apparent increase in
the basal flux of autophagy, by means of higher level
of LC3 lipidated and low p62 levels as well as the lack
of response to chloroquine. Therefore, this deregulated
basal autophagic flux could explain the observed lack of
an apparent autophagic response in case of H1299 E1a
expressing cells. Nonetheless this hypothesis, as well as
the implication of MKP1 in a putative deregulation in the
basal autophagy flux, needs to be further investigate to
fully stablish the role of E1a in autophagy.
In summary, here we present evidences showing
how MKP1 upregulation is a critical event in E1a
associated sensitivity to cDDP in a NSCLC experimental
model. This effect is independent of key genes in lung
carcinogenesis as p53 or K-Ras and is mediated with an
increase in the cDDP triggered apoptosis. Therefore, our
data support the use of E1a gene in future therapeutic
approaches for lung cancer, specifically in cDDP resistant
tumors. Whether our observation could be extrapolated
to other type of tumors or therapeutic agents need to be
deeply investigated.

Bromide, M2128, Sigma Aldrich), at 5 mg/ml in a PBS
solution, was added to the cells in a 1:10 ratio (MTT
solution:culture medium) and left for incubation during
1 h at 37°C. After removal of the medium, DMSO was
added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The
absorbance at 540 nm was determined using a Biokinetics
plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc, Winooski, VT,
USA). Data are the average of at least 3 independent
experiments performed in triplicates cultures.

RNA isolation, reverse transcription and
quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was obtained and reverse transcription
was performed as previously described [65]. Changes
in the mRNA expression of MKP1 and DUSP5 were
examined by Quantitative Real-Time PCR using an
ABIPrism 7500 FAST Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems, Madrid, Spain). cDNA was
amplified using SYBR Green I PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) in the presence of specific oligonucleotides.
The PCR conditions and quantification was performed as
previously described. [65] Primers for all target sequences
were designed using the computer Primer Express
software specially provided with the 7000 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems). PCR primers
were purchase from Bonsai Technologies (Madrid, Spain).
For MKP1: forward 5′-AGCCACCATCTGCCTT
GCTTA-3′; reverse ′5′-CTGGCCCATGAAGCTGAAG
TT-3′.
For DUSP5: forward 5′-CGGAATATCCTGAGTG
TTGCG-3′ - reverse 5′-CACTTGGATGCATGGTAGG
CA-3′ and for GAPDH: forward 5′-TCGTGGAAGGACTC
ATGACCA-3′, reverse 5′-CAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAG
TGA-3′. Data are the average of, at least, three
independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Apoptosis assays
For caspase 3/7 assays, cells were plated at a density
of 104 cells/well in opaque 96-well plates 24 hours prior
to treatment. 24 hours after treatment, activation of
effector caspases 3 and 7 was evaluated with Promega’s
CaspaseGlo kit (G8090) as previously described [62].
Resulting mixtures were quantified after 30 minutes of
incubation at room temperature in a Beckton Dickinson
BD 3096 luminometer. Data are the average of at least 3
independent experiments performed in triplicates cultures.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical
significance was evaluated by Student’s t test using the
GraphPad Prism 5.00 software. The statistical significance
of differences was indicated in figures by asterisks as
follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.

Interference assays
Plasmids containing the sh-RNA for MKP1 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (SHCLND-NM_004417)
and used following the manufacturer’s recommendations
as previously described [62]. Five different clones were
tested and best performing clone was selected for further
experiments.
