ABSTRACT
Lapatinib, a dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been approved for HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
Nevertheless, its inhibitory effect on EGFR did not deliver clinical benefits for triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) patients even EGFR overexpression was frequently
found in this disease. Moreover, lapatinib was unexpectedly found to enhance
metastasis of TNBC cells, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.
In this study, we explored that the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was elevated in
lapatinib-treated TNBC cells. Treatment with IL-6 antibody abolished the lapatinibinduced migration. Mechanistically, the signaling axis of Raf-1/mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38 MAPK, and activator
protein 1 (AP-1) was activated in response to lapatinib treatment to induce IL-6
expression. Furthermore, our data showed that microRNA-7 directly binds and inhibits
Raf-1 3′UTR activity, and that down-regulation of miR-7 by lapatinib contributes to
the activation of Raf-1 signaling pathway and the induction of IL-6 expression. Our
results not only revealed IL-6 as a key regulator of lapatinib-induced metastasis, but
also explored the requirement of miR7/Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1 axis in lapatinib-induced
IL-6 expression.

INTRODUCTION

receptors, breast cancers have been further classified into
luminal and HER2-positive subtypes, respectively. In
contrast to these subtypes, the ‘‘basal-like’’ subtype of
tumors is composed almost entirely of the triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), which is negative for the expressions

and the incidence gradually increases year by year [1].

of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and
HER2 [2, 3]. Population-based studies have demonstrated
that TNBC patients showed lower survival rate as compared
to those with luminal phenotypes [2, 4, 5]. TNBC patients
were much more likely to develop a recurrence during
the first 3 years after treatment and showed a consistent
rate of recurrence over the follow-up period [2, 5]. Recent
studies suggest that TNBC patients have a higher visceral
metastasis, such as brain metastasis [2].
Scientific efforts aiming at dissecting the cancer
biology of TNBC have revealed several promising
therapeutic targets including epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), a critical membrane-bound receptor
tyrosine kinase for cancer progression. EGFR expression
has been detected in up to 80% of TNBC [6, 7]. Lapatinib
is an oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) inhibiting
both EGFR and HER2 receptors. Although the majority of
clinical benefits from lapatinib were achieved in patients
with HER2-positive breast cancers, treatment with
lapatinib for TNBC or HER2-negative patients continues
to be of interest due to its anti-EGFR activity [8, 9].
Thus, lapatinib has also been tested as monotherapy or
in combination with other systemic therapies for triplenegative or other HER2-negative breast cancers in phase
II trials [10, 11]. Unfortunately, lapatinib has shown a lack
of dramatic efficacy in overall HER2-negative diseases,
suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity may not be
the major vulnerability in TNBC. Surprisingly, treatment
with lapatinib in triple-negative or HER2-negative/PRnegative breast cancer patients even showed a worse
clinical outcome with shorter median event-free survival
[8, 12–14]. Our previous studies further uncovered an offtarget activity of lapatinib in promoting the aggressiveness
of TNBC cell lines through induction of EGFR and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expressions [15, 16]. The
increase in EGFR expression is attributed to the downregulation of microRNA-7, and histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) could suppress this
event through restoring of the microRNA-7 level [17]. The
increased EGFR protein in turn cooperates with HuR to
enhance COX-2 expression through mRNA stabilization.
In addition to EGFR, elevation of NF-κB activity through
Src-dependent pathway has also been demonstrated to
contribute to the lapatinib-increased COX-2 expression
[16]. However, other mechanisms, in addition to COX2 up-regulation, responsible for the lapatinib-induced
aggressiveness of TNBC cannot be excluded.
Accumulating evidences have revealed that the
inflammation-related cytokines contribute to the processes
of tumor formation and progression and may counteract
to the efficacy of cancer therapy [18–21]. During the
tumorigenesis, pro-inflammatory cytokines are frequently
up-regulated by oncogene-driven signaling pathways
in the tumor microenvironment and further alter the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) property of
tumor cells. Under this condition, tumor cells become
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more aggressive and resistant to cancer therapy [22–28].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to play a major role
in these processes [21]. Our previous study have shown
that lapatinib treatment increases the IL-6 transcription in
TNBC cells [16]. However, it remains unknown whether
and how IL-6 expression contributes to the lapatinibinduced aggressiveness of TNBC cells.
In this study, our results showed that IL-6
production was dramatically induced and contributed to
the increase in migration ability of MDA-MB-231 TNBC
cells in response to lapatinib treatment. Mechanistically,
lapatinib induces IL-6 expression through Raf-1/MAPK/
AP-1 signaling axis by down regulating microRNA-7.
These findings not only provide a new insight of lapatinibinduced motility of TNBC cells, but also suggest that
targeting IL-6 may be a potential strategy to reduce the
recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer in combination
with EGFR/HER2 TKIs.

RESULTS
IL-6 expression was up-regulated in lapatinibtreated TNBC cells
Our previous study showed that TNBC cells become
more aggressive in response to long-term treatment with
lapatinib [15]. To investigate whether IL-6 is critical for
the lapatinib-induced aggressiveness of TNBC cells, we
first examined the IL-6 expression in both TNBC MDAMB-231 (231) cells and MDA-MB-231/Lap (231/Lap)
clones, which were established by long-term treatment
of 231 cells with lapatinib [16]. The mRNA expression
of IL-6 was obviously elevated in 231/Lap#6 and 231/
Lap#12 clones as compared with the parental 231 cells
(Figure 1A). In parallel, IL-6 protein level detected by
Western blot analysis was increased in these 231/Lap cells
(Figure 1B). The secretion of IL-6 into the medium from
231/Lap clones, detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), was also higher than that from parental 231
cells (Figure 1C). In support to this finding in vivo, IL-6
expression was higher in lapatinib-treated MDA-MB-231
xenograft tumors in SCID mice (Figure 1D), which
showed aggressive metastasis to axillary lymph nodes in
our previous study [15]. The inductions of total or secreted
IL-6 level by lapatinib in a time-dependent manner were
further found in primary human breast cancer cells from
two TNBC patients (Figure 1E and 1F, respectively).
These results indicate that lapatinib treatment induced IL-6
expression in TNBC cells.

Elevation of IL-6 contributes to the lapatinibenhanced aggressiveness of TNBC cells
Up-regulation of IL-6 has been reported to enhance
the migration ability of various tumor cells [21, 26, 32].

treated clones (231/Lap#6 and 231/Lap#12) showed higher
migration ability than their parental cells in transwell
migration assays (Figure 2A). We next examined whether
IL-6 secretion is involved in lapatinib-induced migration
ability of TNBCs through an autocrine regulation. To
this end, 231/Lap#6 cells were incubated with or without
specific anti-IL-6 antibody in the transwells. The results
showed that their migration ability was dramatically
inhibited by anti-IL-6 antibody (Figure 2B). To further
confirm this finding, 231 and 231/Lap#6 cells were
cultured for 24 hrs, and then the incubated media were
collected and defined as conditioned media 231-CM

and 231/Lap#6-CM, respectively. As illustrated in
Figure 2C, these conditioned media were added into the
lower chamber of transwells, and 231 cells in serum-free
medium were seeded in the upper chamber for migration
assay. Incubation with 231/Lap#6-CM induced higher
migration ability of 231 cells than that with 231-CM did
(Figure 2D) and this effect was attenuated by anti-IL6
antibody (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the migration ability
of 231 cells was also enhanced when recombinant IL-6
protein was added into 231-CM (Figure 2F). These results
indicated that lapatinib enhances the migration ability of
TNBC cells through IL-6 up-regulation.

MAPK/AP-1 axis mediated lapatinib-induced
IL-6 production in TNBC cells

(Figure 6B) were found in 231/Lap clones. The
induction of Raf-1 by lapatinib in a time-dependent
manner was also found in human primary breast
cancer cells from TNBC patients (Figure 6C). Raf-1
inhibitor GW5074 attenuated lapatinib-induced
ERK1/2 and c-Jun phosphorylations in 231/Lap cells
(Figure 6D), indicating the contribution of Raf-1 to
the activation of MAPK/AP-1 axis. Furthermore,
Gw5074 also suppressed the IL-6 mRNA (Figure 6E)
and protein (Figure 6F) expressions in 231/Lap cells,
and significantly decreased the promoter activity
of IL-6 gene (Figure 6G). More importantly, this
inhibitor suppressed the migration ability of 231/Lap
cells (Figure 6H). These results indicate the essential
role of Raf-1 in lapatinib-induced IL-6 expression and
migration.
We next investigated the mechanism of Raf-1
upregulation in 231/Lap cells. Our pervious study
showed an increase in EGFR expression in response
to lapatinib treatment [16], raising the possibility that
the upregulated EGFR induced the Raf-1 activation.
However, knockdown of EGFR by siRNA did not affect
the Raf-1 and ERK activations (Figure 7A), ruling out
the involvement of EGFR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
are involved in processes of cancer that includes
development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis
[40–42]. Our previous study showed that lapatinib
treatment reduced the expression of microRNA-7
(MiR-7) in MDA-MB-231/Lap cells, and thereby led
to their enhanced migration and invasion abilities [16].
MiR-7 also functions in cell cycle arrest and in reducing
cell growth and viability [43–45]. We thus investigated
the role of miR-7 in mediating lapatinib-induced Raf-1/
MAPK/c-Jun activation and IL-6 expression by restoring
the expression of miR-7 in MDA-MB-231/Lap cells. As
shown in Figure 7B, overexpression of miR-7 suppressed
lapatinib-induced Raf-1 expression and phosphorylation.
Restoration of miR-7 also reduced the IL-6 expression in
MDA-MB-23/Lap cells (Figure 7C). Furthermore, Raf1 3′ UTR activity was higher in 231/Lap cells than in
parental cells as measured by luciferase-reporter assay
(Figure 7D). Association with Ago2 is required for
microRNA-mediated translation suppression. Binding
of Ago2 on Raf-1 mRNA 3′UTR was lower in 231/
Lap cells than in parental 231 cells (Figure 7E). To
further confirm the inhibitory effect of miR-7 on Raf-1
3′UTR activity, miR7 inhibitor was transfected into
MDA-MB-231 cells in the luciferase reporter assays,
and results showed a dose-dependent increase in Raf1 3′UTR luciferase activity (Figure 7F). In contrast,
overexpression of miR7 mimic reduced Raf-1 3′UTR
luciferase activity in 231/Lap clones (Figure 7G). In
addition, our data reveled that the ago2 binding activity
on Raf-1 3′UTR was also reduced by miR-7 inhibitor in
RNA-IP analysis (Figure 7H). These results indicate that
lapatinib treatment induced IL-6 production through derepression of Raf-1 via downregulating miR-7.

We next investigated how the IL-6 expression
is up-regulated by lapatinib. Accumulating evidences
showed that IL-6 expression is mainly controlled by
MAPK pathway [33–35], and sustained activation of
MAPK pathways was observed in response to lapatinib
resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer cells [36]. We
thus examined the involvement of MAPK pathways in
the up-regulation of IL-6 expression in 231/Lap cells.
As shown in Figure 3A, activities of ERK1/2, p38,
and JNK were higher in 231/Lap cells compare to 231
cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of individual MAPKs
(PD98059, AZD6244 and U0126 for ERK1/2; SP600125
for JNK; SB203580 and SB202190 for p38) suppressed
the IL-6 expression at both protein (Figure 3B) and
mRNA levels (Figure 3C), suggesting that lapatinib
induces IL-6 expression in part through activation of
MAPK pathways.
Transcription factor AP-1 is consist of c-Jun and
c-Fos and is controlled by MAPK pathways [37–39].
Since MAPK pathways mediate the IL-6 expression in
231/Lap cells, we further addressed whether the cisregulatory element of AP-1 on IL-6 promoter region
is required for lapatinib-induced IL-6 expression. The
protein expression and activation of c-Jun, but not c-fos,
by lapatinib were found in 231/Lap#6 cells (Figure 4A),
and ERK1/2 inhibitors PD98059, U0126 and AZD6244
significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of c-Jun
(Figure 4B). Suppression of JNK by SP600125
also dramatically reduced both the protein and
phosphorylation level of c-Jun in 231/Lap#6 cells
(Figure 4C). These data suggest that lapatinib-activated
MAPK pathways regulate IL-6 expression via AP-1
activation. Indeed, IL-6 promoter activity was higher
in 231/Lap cells than in parental 231 cells (Figure 5A).
Mutation of AP-1-binding sites (Figure 5B) and MAPK
inhibitors (Figure 5C) significantly decreased the
promoter activity. Furthermore, the binding activity of
c-Jun protein on the promoter region of IL-6 gene as
detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was
dramatically increased in 231//Lap cells (Figure 5D).
These results demonstrated that treatment with lapatinib
induces MAPK pathways and c-Jun expression to turn
on IL-6 gene transcription.

MicroRNA-7 downregulation contributes to
lapatinib-induced Raf-1 activation in mediating
MAPK/AP-1 activation and IL-6 production
We next addressed the underlying mechanisms
of MAPK/AP-1 activation in response to lapatinib
treatment. Raf-1 activates the MAPK/ERK kinase
(MEK) 1/2 dual-specificity protein kinases, which
then activate MAPKs. Elevations of Raf-1 activity

DISCUSSION

enzymes, and extracellular proteases, may also promote
metastasis and invasion [51, 52]. In metastatic tumor
microenvironment, high level of pro-inflammatory
cytokines in metastatic tumor microenvironment has been
detected, and renders cancer cells highly transformative
[20, 26]. IL-6 has been proposed to enhance cell
proliferation and metastatic ability of tumor cells [20, 21,
26, 53]. Co-targeting of IL-6 and VEGF was found to
potently inhibit glioma growth and invasiveness [54],
implying that IL-6 production in response to cancer therapy
may contribute to the invasiveness of recurrent tumors.
Several lines of evidence in this study demonstrated
that lapatinib treatment enhanced cell migration through
induction of IL-6 expression. First, IL-6 protein and
mRNA expressions are higher in lapatinib-resistant cells.
Second, addition of IL-6 significantly induced cell motility.
Third, neutralization of IL-6 by specific antibody in the
culture medium reduced the migration of MDA-MB-231/

Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) express
neither hormone receptors nor HER2 and possess highly
invasive ability. Although chemotherapy is the major
therapeutic option, recent scientific efforts have revealed
that targeting EGFR may be a potential strategy for such
patients. TNBCs frequently overexpress EGFR and the
antitumor activity of lapatinib in such diseases was also
tested [46, 47]. However, this drug did not show clinical
benefits, and, in contrast, even promoted cancer metastasis
and development of drug resistance [16].
Induction of reactive responses by cancer therapy has
been proposed to increase oncogenic potential of cancer
and lead to drug resistance [48–50]. The compensatory
hypoxic responses in response to angiogenesis inhibition,
including HIF-1-induced gene expression and secretion

Lap cells. These results suggest that the autocrined IL-6
up-regulated by lapatinib mediated the cell migration,
and that targeting IL-6 may reduce the off-target effect of
lapatinib on cell motility.
We previously reported that lapatinib induced
migration and invasion of TNBC cells through COX-2
and EGFR expression via downregulation of microRNA-7
[26]. In this study, our data also demonstrate the
involvement of miR-7 downregulation in lapatinibincreased Raf-1 activation and IL-6 expression, revealing
multiple roles of miR-7 in response to lapatinib in TNBCs.
Raf-1, belonging to the MKKK family, is regulated by
multiple mechanisms including phosphorylation and
interactions with various proteins, and functions as an
upstream molecule of mitogen-activated protein kinase
ERK, JNK and p38 pathways, which are involved in the
regulation of gene expression [55]. IL-6 promoter activity
was suppressed by the inhibitors of Raf-1, MEK, JNK
and p38 in 231/Lap cells, indicating that IL-6 production
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is mediated by Raf-1/ MAPK activation in response
to lapatinib treatment. DNA binding sites for AP-1
transcription factor, were found in the 5′ region of IL-6
gene [37–39]. Raf-1, MEK and JNK inhibitor also reduced
the binding activity of c-Jun to the AP-1 element on IL-6
promoter and the promoter activity, showing that AP-1
activation contributes to lapatinib-induced IL-6 production
in TNBCs. A recent study reported that specific EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib induce IL-6 expression
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma through
NOX4/p38 and JNK/ NF-κB pathway [28, 56]. Therefore,
Raf-1/MAPK signaling pathway might be a common
signaling pathway in IL-6 upregulation in response to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, it remains to
be clarified whether these effects are due to inhibition of
EGFR kinase activity.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in processes
of carcinogenic including development, differentiation,

addition to being targeted by miR-7, EGFR has also
been reported to induce miR-7 transcription relying on
its tyrosine kinase activity [58], suggesting that miR-7
regulates EGFR expression through negative feedback.
Therefore, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity by
lapatinib may account for the downregulation of miR7 and subsequent elevation of the Raf-1/ERK and IL-6

and function of microRNAs have been associated with
tumorigenesis. MiR-7 has been reported to downregulate EGFR mRNA and other genes in lung breast,
and glioblastoma cell cancer cell lines to induce cell
cycle arrest and cell death [45, 57]. Our previous study
reported that lapatinib enhances COX-2 and EGFR
expression through downregulation of miR-7 [16]. In

expression. In addition to its potential role in tumor
promotion and progression, overexpression of IL-6 has
been suggested to promote resistance to EGFR TKIs in
both EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent manners
[59]. However, silencing EGFR expression did not affect
Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1 protein levels in 231/Lap clones.
Our data suggest that lapatinib induced Raf-1 expression
due to downregulation of miR-7, which can bind to and
target Raf-1 3′ UTR, leading to the downregulation of
Raf-1 protein level. Transfection of lapatinib-treated

cells with miR-7 also reduced lapatinib-increased IL-6
production and down-regulate Raf-1 activity. These
results indicate that downregulation of miR-7 may
contribute to activation of Raf-1/MAPK signaling
pathway in breast cancer cells in response to lapatinib
treatment (Figure 8).
In summary, our results elucidate a role of miR-7dependent activation of Raf-1/MAPK/AP-1 in contribution
to IL-6 upregulation and subsequent cell migration,
suggesting a possible link to drug resistance. These

treatment with lapatinib activates Raf-1/MAPK signaling pathways though downregulation of miR-7 expression. Then, the activated
MAPKs induce expression and binding of c-Jun to IL-6 promoter, which leads to the production of IL-6. The secreted IL-6 in turn enhances
the migration ability of TNBC cells.
a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. The lapatinibtreated derivatives were established and selected by
treating MDA-MB-231 cells with gradually increasing
concentrations of lapatinib from 1 μM.

findings imply IL-6 as a potential target for enhancing the
therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)

Materials

MDA-MB-231 and its lapatinib-treated derivatives,
MDA-MB-231/Lap, were grown to reach confluence. The
culture media were refreshed with DMEM/F12. Conditioned
media were collected 1 day after the refreshment of media
and stored at −80°C until use as described previously [29,
30]. The MDA-MB-231-CM was used as reference.

Mouse polyclonal antibodies specific for IL-6, rabbit
polyclonal antibodies specific for EGFR, phospho-c-Jun
and c-Jun were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific
for phospho-Raf-1 Ser338, Raf-1, phospho-ERK1/2
Thr202/Tyr204, ERK1/2, phospho-JNK Thr183/Tyr185,
JNK, phospho-p38 Thr180/Tyr182 and p38 were from
Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). PD98059, SB203580,
SP600125, U0126, GW5074 and AZD6244 were obtained
from Calbiochem (San Diago, CA). Mouse polyclonal
antibody specific for IL-6 was purchased from R&D systems
(Minneapolis, MN). All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). IL-6 enzyme immunoassay
kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

Measurement of IL-6 expression
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/Lap cell lines
were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to grow for
24 hrs. Cells were pre-treated with various inhibitors
for 48 hrs. Then, two medium was collected and stored
at −80°C until use. IL-6 expression in the medium
was assayed by using IL-6 enzyme immunoassay kits,
according to the procedure described by the manufacturer.

Cell culture

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)

Human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line and its
lapatinib-treated derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 unit/ ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin. All cancer cell lines were maintained in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Total RNA was extracted from MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-231/Lap cells by using TRIzol reagent. The
reverse transcription reaction was performed by using
37974

Oncotarget

Overexpression of microRNA-7 (miR-7)
expression

1 ug of total RNA that was reversely transcribed into
cDNA with oligo (dT) primer. The cDNA level of IL-6
was examined in quantitative PCR analysis with IL-6
specific primer, which sequences are as follows: Forward:
5′-TTGAGACTCATGGGAAAATCC-3′ and Reverse:
5′-CAAGACATGCCAAAGTGCTG-3′.

TNBC cells were transfected with 1 μg of mimiccontrol and mimic-miR-7 plasmid vector [15]. TNBC
cells were grown to 80% confluence in 12 well plates and
transfected with TransIT®-2020 on the following day. DNA
and TransIT®-2020 transfection reagent were pre-mixed
with a ratio of 1:1 in serum-free medium for 20 mins and
then applied to the cells. Serum was supplemented to the
cells 6 hrs later. After 3-day transfection, the cells were
subjected to indicate experiments.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared as indicated
experiments. Proteins were resolved on sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred to polyvinyldifluoride (Immobilon-P)
membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% milk
for 1 hr at room temperature and probed with rabbit
antibodies against Raf-1, ERK1/2, JNK or p38 (1:1000)
for overnight at 4°C. After washing three times, the
blots were subsequently incubated with an anti-rabbit
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000)
for 1 hr at room temperature. The blots were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence with use of Kodak
X-OMAT LS film.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP analysis was performed as described
previously [31]. In brief, cells were treated, fixed and
sheared. The DNA immunoprecipitated by c-Jun antibody
was purified and then extracted with phenol-chloroform.
The purified DNA pellet was subjected to PCR. PCR
products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis
and visualized by UV. The primer sequences used for
detecting IL-6 promoter region (−312 to −39) were as
follows: Forward: 5′-GAACTGACCTGACTTACATA-3′
and reverse: 5′-TTGAGACTCATGGGAAAATCC-3′.

Transfection and reporter gene assay
TNBC cells were transfected with 1 μg of
luciferase-bearing plasmid and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase
expression vector. TNBC cells were grown to 80%
confluence in 12 well plates and subjected to transfection
with TransIT®-2020 on the following day. DNA and
TransIT®-2020 transfection reagent were pre-mixed with
a ratio of 1:1 in serum-free medium for 20 mins and
then applied to the cells. Serum was supplemented to the
cells 6 hrs later. After 24- hr transfection, the cells were
subjected to indicate experiments. Whole cell lysates
were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and
the supernatants were collected after centrifugation at
13,000 rpm for 10 mins. Aliquots of cell lysates (20 μl)
containing equal amounts of protein (20–30 μg) were
placed into wells of an opaque black 96-well microplate.
An equal volume of luciferase substrate was added to all
samples and luminescence was measured in a microplate
luminometer. The value of luciferase activity was
normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector.

RNA immunoprecipitation (RNAIP) assay
MDA-MB-231 or 231/Lap cells were transfected
with 100 nM miR-7 mimic or inhibitor for 3 days, and
then were fixed and sheared. The lystate was incubated
with rabbit-IgG and Ago2 (cell signaling, Danvers,
MA) antibody followed by immunoprecipitation with
protein A/G beads at 4°C overnight. Then supernatant
was removed, and beads were resuspended with RNAIP
buffer followed by RNA isolation with TRIzol reagent.
The purified RNA was subjected into reverse transcription
with oligo (dT) primer. The immunoprecipitated Raf-1
mRNA level was examined in real-time PCR reaction with
specific primers targeting at Raf-1 3′UTR as following:
5′- ACTAGTTTGACTTTGCACCTGTCTTC-3′ and 5′AAGCTTACACCTAAATTTAATTTATT-3′.

Statistic analysis
Data were displayed as means ±SEM. The
significance of difference between the experimental and
control groups was assessed by Student’s t test. The
difference is significant if the p value is < 0.05.

Immunohistochemistry staining
Five-micro thick paraffin wax mouse-tissue sections
were dewaxing by xylene and rehydrated by different
concentration of ethanol. These mouse-tissue sections
were incubated for overnight with IL-6 antibody (50
dilution, Santa Cruz, CA), and were washed for removal
of unbound primary antibody. These sections were then
stained with a polymer HRP conjugate secondary antibody
rabbit antibody for 30 mins followed by reaction with
diaminobenzidine for two minutes.
