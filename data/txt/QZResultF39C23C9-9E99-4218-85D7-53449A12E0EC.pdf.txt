BACKGROUND: Dasatinib, a highly potent BCR-ABL inhibitor, is an effective treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML CP) after resistance, suboptimal response, or intolerance to prior imatinib. In a
phase 3 dose optimization trial in patients with CML CP (CA180-034), the occurrence of pleural effusion was significantly minimized with dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) compared with other treatment arms (70 mg twice daily
[twice daily], 140 mg QD, or 50 mg twice daily). METHODS: To investigate the occurrence and management of pleural effusion during dasatinib treatment, and efficacy in patients with or without pleural effusion, data from CA180034 were analyzed. RESULTS: With 24-month minimum follow-up, 14% of patients treated with dasatinib 100 mg QD
incurred pleural effusion (grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 0%) compared with 23% to 26% in other study arms. The pleural effusion rate showed only a minimal increment from 12 to 24 months. In the 100 mg QD study arm, median time to pleural effusion (any grade) was 315 days, and after pleural effusion, 52% of patients had a transient dose interruption,
35% had a dose reduction, 57% received a diuretic, and 26% received a corticosteroid. Three patients in the 100 mg
QD study arm discontinued treatment after pleural effusion. Across all study arms, patients with or without pleural
effusion demonstrated similar progression-free and overall survival, and cytogenetic response rates were higher in
patients with a pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusion is minimized with dasatinib 100 mg QD dosing and

Dasatinib (Sprycel, Bristol-Myers Squibb, NY) is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has 325-fold higher in

vitro potency than imatinib against unmutated BCR-ABL.1 Dasatinib also inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-b, SRC, and c-KIT. In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph þ ALL), who have developed resistance, suboptimal response, or intolerance to prior
imatinib, dasatinib induces high rates of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses, and minimal cross intolerance to imatinib has been observed.2-6 In CA180-034, a phase 3 dasatinib dose-optimization trial in patients with chronic
phase (CP) CML, dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) significantly minimized the occurrence of key adverse events, including pleural effusion, while maintaining efficacy.6

Original Article

The aim of the current report was to analyze
24-month data from the CA180-034 trial with specific
reference to the dynamics of pleural effusion, how
investigators managed pleural effusion, and the
efficacy of dasatinib in patients with or without pleural
effusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The design and methodology of the dasatinib CA180-034
trial has been reported previously.6 Briefly, CA180-034 is
a phase 3 dose optimization study in patients with CML
CP after resistance, suboptimal response, or intolerance to
imatinib. Patients were randomized using a 2  2 factorial
design to dasatinib administered at 1 of 4 dose schedules:
100 mg QD, 70 mg twice daily, 140 mg QD, or 50 mg
twice daily, with dose interruption/reduction or escalation
allowed for the management of toxicity or inadequate
response. Patients were treated until disease progression
or excessive toxicity, as determined by the treating physician, and all patients were followed for survival status irrespective of drug discontinuation or disease progression.
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional
Review Board/Ethics Committee at each participating
center. Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients.
Definition of Pleural Effusion
Pleural effusion was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (AEs) Version 3.0 as follows: grade 1,
asymptomatic; grade 2, symptomatic, with any intervention such as diuretics or up to 2 therapeutic thoracenteses
indicated; grade 3, symptomatic and supplemental oxygen, more than 2 therapeutic thoracenteses, tube drainage,
or pleurodesis indicated; and grade 4, life-threatening (eg,
causing hemodynamic instability or ventilatory support
indicated). In all patients, chest x-ray was performed at
the discretion of the investigator and at protocol-stipulated intervals (baseline, after 12 weeks and after 6
months) to detect asymptomatic pleural effusion.
In this analysis, any patient who incurred pleural
effusion at any time was included in the pleural effusion
group, irrespective of whether the event was classified by
the investigator as drug related. Because of statistical considerations, data were analyzed based on the first reported
instance of pleural effusion in each patient. Because proto-

378

col-specified assessments and case report forms did not
collect data on pleural effusion duration, resolution, or recurrence, these could not be analyzed.
Pleural Effusion Management
In the study protocol, recommendations for managing
nonhematologic grade 2 AEs, including pleural effusion, were as follows: after grade 2 AE, dasatinib was interrupted until the AE resolved (to grade 1, as determined
by individual investigators), and then restarted at the original dose; after recurrence of same grade 2 AE, dasatinib
was interrupted and restarted at a reduced dose (80 mg
QD in the 100 mg QD study arm); after second recurrence of the same grade 2 AE, dasatinib discontinuation
could have been considered by the investigator according
to the best interests of the patient (140 mg QD and 70 mg
twice daily study arms were permitted a second dose
reduction); after grade 3 AE, dasatinib was interrupted
until the AE resolved, and then restarted at a reduced
dose; after recurrence of same grade 3 AE, dasatinib discontinuation could have been considered (or a second
dose reduction could have been performed, if permitted);
after grade 4 AE, patients did not generally receive additional dasatinib therapy, unless considered by the investigator to be in the best interests of the patient.
Administration of additional treatments for pleural
effusion was at the discretion of individual investigators.
To investigate diuretics or corticosteroids potentially used
to manage pleural effusion, lists of concomitantly administered medications were searched using terms comprising
26 different diuretics and 15 different corticosteroids. All
diuretic or corticosteroid agents administered at the time
of pleural effusion were assumed to have been used in
pleural effusion management.
The use of thoracentesis at the time of pleural effusion was also assessed. Thoracentesis was performed at the
discretion of investigators. Reporting of thoracentesis procedures occurred separately from AE grading and did not
routinely indicate whether thoracentesis was performed
for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes or both. Results of
diagnostic thoracenteses were not collected as part of the
study protocol.
Response Assessment
Efficacy was evaluated using standard hematologic and
bone marrow cytogenetic assessments to determine rates
of complete hematologic response (CHR), major cytogenetic response, and complete cytogenetic response, as previously described.7

Dasatinib Pleural Effusion Analysis/Porkka et al

Lymphocytosis
For the purposes of this analysis, lymphocytosis during
dasatinib treatment was defined as an absolute blood
lymphocyte count greater than 3.6  109/L on at least 2
occasions after more than 4 weeks of dasatinib therapy.
Complete blood counts were performed at baseline and at
regular intervals (every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks and
every 3 months thereafter). For this analysis, elevated
lymphocyte counts within the first 4 weeks of dasatinib
therapy were not included in the determination of
lymphocytosis. Mean lymphocyte counts in groups of
patients were calculated from mean values for all absolute
lymphocyte counts determined after the first 4 weeks of
dasatinib therapy in each patient.
Statistical Analysis
Duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS),
overall survival, and treatment without pleural effusion
were estimated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit methodology, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
calculated. Progression was defined as increasing white
blood cell count, loss of CHR or major cytogenetic
response, 30% increase in Ph þ metaphases, confirmed accelerated or blast phase, or death. For duration of response and PFS analysis, patients who neither
progressed/lost response nor died were censored at last
cytogenetic or hematologic assessment before loss of
follow-up, and patients were not followed after study
drug discontinuation for protocol-stipulated reasons,
including withdrawal of informed consent, any adverse
event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness
(which, in the investigator’s opinion, indicated that
continued treatment was not in the patient’s best interest), pregnancy, and stem-cell transplantation (SCT).
For overall survival analysis, patients who did not die
or were lost to follow-up were censored on last known
alive date regardless of whether or not they discontinued study drug. For analysis of treatment without pleural effusion, patients who did not incur pleural effusion
were censored if dasatinib treatment ended for any
reason.
Fisher exact test was used to compare the rates of
pleural effusion across treatment arms. Pearson chi-square
test was used to examine a possible association between
the occurrence of pleural effusion and lymphocytosis or
cytogenetic response; because these analyses were not prespecified or controlled, interpretation of significance is
not possible and the P value is provided for descriptive
purposes only.

Risk Factor Analysis
Baseline patient characteristics and lymphocytosis during
dasatinib therapy were investigated as potential risk factors for pleural effusion. Odds ratios and their 95% CIs
were calculated using logistic regression. The probability
of pleural effusion was regressed as a single covariate. Continuous variables were split into categories (age) or quartiles (time from initial diagnosis). Data on comorbidities
(eg, prior cardiac history, pulmonary disease, or fluid
retention toxicity on imatinib) were not routinely or uniformly collected as part of the study protocol and could
not, therefore, be included in the risk factor analysis. In
addition, multivariate logistic regression, modeling the
probability of achieving a cytogenetic response (major
cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response)
with baseline patient characteristics and the occurrence of
lymphocytosis and pleural effusion on study, was performed. Patients who were not evaluated for any of the
specified covariates were excluded from the regression.
Because of the large number of P values generated, and
because no correction for multiple testing was performed,
P values are provided for descriptive purposes only.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Patient demographics and disease characteristics in the
CA180-034 trial have been presented previously.6 In total,
662 patients were treated with dasatinib (100 mg QD, n ¼
165; 70 mg twice daily, n ¼ 167; 140 mg QD, n ¼ 163; 50
mg twice daily, n ¼ 167). Median patient age was 55 years
(range 18-84) and patients had received prior imatinib therapy for a median duration of approximately 3 years. In all
study arms, median duration of dasatinib treatment was 22
months. The minimum follow-up for this analysis was 24
months (last patient first visit to database lock).
Dose Schedule and Pleural Effusion
Across all treatment arms combined, pleural effusion of
any grade was reported in 22% of patients. In the 100 mg
QD study arm, the overall rate of pleural effusion after at
least 24 months of follow-up was 14% (grade 3: 2%;
grade 4: 0%). After at least 12 months of follow-up, 10%
had incurred pleural effusion (grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 0%),
suggesting a minimal increment between 12 and 24
months. Overall 24-month rates of pleural effusion in the
other study arms were 23%-26% (P ¼ .021 for the comparison across all 4 study arms) (Table 1). Across all treatment arms combined, median time to pleural effusion

(any grade) was 183 days. In the 100 mg QD study arm,
median time to pleural effusion was 315 days, compared
with 136, 148, and 289 days for 70 mg twice daily, 140
mg QD, and 50 mg twice daily study arms, respectively.
Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, at 12 and 24 months,
10% and 16% of patients in the 100 mg QD study arm
had incurred pleural effusion of any grade, respectively
(Fig. 1).
Management of Pleural Effusion
Transient dose interruption after pleural effusion was performed in 12 patients in the 100 mg QD study arm (representing 7% of all 165 patients in this study arm and
52% of the 23 patients who incurred a pleural effusion),
compared with 22-25 patients in other study arms (13%15% of all patients in each study arm and 56%-60% of
patients who incurred a pleural effusion) (Table 2). Dose
reduction after pleural effusion occurred in 8 patients in
the 100 mg QD study arm (5% of all patients, 35% of
patients who incurred a pleural effusion), compared with
13-16 patients in other study arms (8%-10% of all
patients, 30%-38% of those who incurred a pleural
effusion).
Among patients in the 100 mg QD study arm, additional therapies at the time of pleural effusion included
diuretics in 13 patients (representing 8% of all patients in
this study arm and 57% of those who incurred a pleural
effusion) and corticosteroids in 6 patients (4% of all
patients, 26% of patients who incurred a pleural effusion).

Across all treatment arms, 12 patients had a diagnostic or therapeutic thoracentesis at the time of pleural effusion. One patient was reported by the investigator as
having received a thoracentesis after a grade 1 pleural effusion, probably with diagnostic intent. In addition, a thoracentesis was performed in 5 patients after grade 2 pleural
effusion and 6 patients after grade 3. Three of the 12
patients had 2 thoracenteses (50 mg twice daily, n ¼ 1; 70

reason for treatment discontinuation for 3 patients (2%)
in the 100 mg QD study arm, compared with 7 to 9
patients (4%-5%) in other study arms.
Lymphocytosis
In the total study group, lymphocytosis was detected in 37%
patients with a pleural effusion and 26% patients without a
pleural effusion (Table 3). Among assessed patients who
developed lymphocytosis, 29% incurred a pleural effusion,
compared with 20% of those who did not develop lymphocytosis. A chi-square test suggested a possible association
between the occurrence of lymphocytosis and pleural effusion (P ¼ .0082). Mean average lymphocyte counts in
assessed patients with or without a pleural effusion were 2.82
 109/L and 2.05  109/L, respectively.
Risk Factors for Pleural Effusion

as potential risk factors for pleural effusion: age, sex, dura-

tion of CML before dasatinib treatment, and prior SCT.
Of baseline factors, older age was the only characteristic
associated with an increased risk of pleural effusion (Fig. 2,
Table 4). The development of lymphocytosis during dasatinib treatment was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk
of pleural effusion (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.5).
Hematologic and Cytogenetic Responses
Pleural effusion did not interfere with achieving or maintaining a treatment response to dasatinib. The CHR rate
was 91% in both patients with or without pleural effusion
(Table 5). In the 100 mg QD study arm, CHR rates in
patients with or without a pleural effusion were 96% and
92%, respectively. The overall major cytogenetic response
rate for patients with a pleural effusion was 70% compared with 61% for those without (P ¼ .044), and rates in
the 100 mg QD study arm were 70% and 63% (P ¼ .57),
respectively. Among all patients across all 4 study arms
who achieved a major cytogenetic response, this level of
response was maintained at 18 months by an estimated

85% of patients with and 89% of patients without a pleural effusion (Fig. 3). In the 100 mg QD study arm, major
cytogenetic responses were maintained at 18 months by
93% of patients with or without a pleural effusion. Overall complete cytogenetic response rates in patients with or
without a pleural effusion were 61% and 49% (P ¼ .013),
with the same rates observed in the 100 mg QD study arm
(P ¼ .27). Among all patients across all 4 treatment arms
who achieved a complete cytogenetic response, this level
of response was maintained at 18 months by 88% with a
pleural effusion and 92% of patients without a pleural
effusion. With 100 mg QD treatment, 93% of patients
with a pleural effusion and 95% of patients without a
pleural effusion had maintained their complete cytogenetic response at 18 months. In patients who incurred
pleural effusion, hematologic and cytogenetic responses
were initially achieved not only before but also after the
pleural effusion event (Table 6).
A multivariate analysis was performed of selected
patient characteristics at baseline (age, time from initial
CML diagnosis, imatinib status [resistant/suboptimal
response or intolerant], major cytogenetic response on
prior imatinib, baseline level of Ph þ cells or blast cells
in bone marrow, baseline level of white blood cells or
basophils) and the occurrence of pleural effusion and
lymphocytosis, and their association with major cytogenetic response or complete cytogenetic response on dasatinib therapy (Table 7). Patients receiving any dasatinib
dose were included in the analysis. In addition to other

variables, pleural effusion was associated with an
increased probability of achieving a major cytogenetic
response (P ¼ .0039) and complete cytogenetic response
(P ¼ .0027). After adjusting for other variables analyzed,
the odds ratio for response in patients with a pleural effusion compared with those without was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.3
to 3.5) for both major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response, indicating that pleural effusion may be associated with an increased likelihood of
response to dasatinib.
PFS and Overall Survival
PFS and overall survival were similar in patients with or
without a pleural effusion. The 24-month PFS rate for
patients with a pleural effusion was 75% compared with
76% for those without (Fig. 4). In the dasatinib 100 mg
QD study arm, corresponding PFS rates were 78% and
80%, respectively. Overall survival rates at 24 months for
patients with or without a pleural effusion were 93% and
90%, respectively, in the total group and 89% and 91%,
respectively, in the 100 mg QD study arm (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
The results of this analysis demonstrate that the currently
approved dasatinib dose in CML CP of 100 mg QD significantly minimizes the occurrence of pleural effusion.
With minimum follow-up of 24 months, 14% of patients
who received dasatinib 100 mg QD incurred pleural effusion compared with 23% to 26% in other study arms. In
addition, only 2% of patients treated with dasatinib 100
mg QD experienced a grade 3 pleural effusion, with no
grade 4 events reported, whereas grade 3 of 4 pleural effusion rates were 4% to 6% in other study arms. Rates at 24
months showed only a minimal increment compared with

ity of responses, PFS, and overall survival in patients with
pleural effusion were similar or higher than in patients
without pleural effusion. All 4 dasatinib treatment arms
displayed comparable efficacy. Some patients achieved
CHR, major cytogenetic response, or complete cytogenetic response on dasatinib after pleural effusion had
occurred, demonstrating that the occurrence of pleural
effusion, although sometimes associated with treatment
interruption and dose reduction, did not prevent achievement of a treatment response.
In the 034 trial, management of pleural effusion was
broadly similar across all treatment arms. Approximately
half of patients with a pleural effusion underwent transient dose interruption and approximately one-third
underwent dose reduction. In addition, more patients
with a pleural effusion received diuretics than corticosteroids (approximately 50% vs 25%). Compared with the
other dosing schedules, patients treated with dasatinib
100 mg QD appeared to require fewer dose interruptions
and reductions as a result of pleural effusion, although the
study design did not enable statistical comparison. Management methods used during the trial are similar to those
reported previously.8,9 Because data on duration and resolution of pleural effusion were not collected during the
034 study, the relative effectiveness of different interventions for pleural effusion cannot be assessed, and this
would be an potential area for future study.
The improved tolerability of 100 mg QD dosing
may be driven in part by intermittent exposure to inhibitory drug concentrations, compared with the continuous
exposure achieved with twice daily dosing.6 A pharmacokinetic analysis has recently demonstrated that the risk of

pleural effusion with dasatinib decreased with decreasing
plasma trough concentrations, with 100 mg QD dosing
providing the lowest steady-state trough concentration
compared with other treatment arms.10 Laboratory studies suggest that because of its high potency, transient exposure to dasatinib is sufficient to inhibit BCR-ABL kinase
activity and induce apoptosis in CML cell lines.11 This
may help to explain the equivalent efficacy observed across
the 4 treatment arms of the 034 trial.
The exact mechanism of pleural effusion occurring
during dasatinib therapy is unknown. Previous singlecenter studies have found that pleural effusions during
dasatinib treatment were found to be exudative in the
majority of cases.8,9 Based on reports of high lymphocyte
frequency in pleural fluids and pleural tissue8 and an
association with immune-mediated reactions, such as
skin rash or a prior history of auto-immunity,12

patients with or without pleural effusion is depicted. (A)

immune-mediated mechanisms have been suggested.
Supporting this hypothesis, a recent report by Mustjoki
et al of patients with different phases of CML or Ph þ
ALL has demonstrated that patients who experienced
lymphocytosis during dasatinib therapy experienced a
higher occurrence of pleural effusion.13 In the present
analysis, which includes patients with CML CP only, a
possible association was also observed between patients
who experienced lymphocytosis during dasatinib therapy and those who incurred pleural effusion, although
the rate of pleural effusion in patients with lymphocytosis (29%) was lower than in the report by Mustjoki et al
( 60%). However, a separate report did not find any

the achievement of cytogenetic response on dasatinib
treatment. In a previous study, pleural effusion during
dasatinib therapy was associated with an increased rate of
molecular responses, although the difference in rates of
cytogenetic response was not significant.15 Other studies
have reported that patients who developed lymphocytosis
during dasatinib treatment achieved favorable treatment
responses, and it was speculated that this might be due to
potential antileukemic effects associated with immune
activation.13,14 Additional prospective studies are required to confirm this possible association. The putative
immune-mediated mechanism, including the occurrence
of lymphocytosis, suggests that administration of corticosteroids may be appropriate for pleural effusion occurring
with dasatinib.
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that in
patients with CML CP with resistance, suboptimal
response, or intolerance to prior imatinib, dasatinib 100
mg QD treatment minimizes the occurrence of pleural
effusion. Importantly, the occurrence of a pleural effusion
does not interfere with the achievement of hematologic or
cytogenetic responses or duration of response, PFS, or
overall survival.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
association between lymphocytosis and pleural effusion.14 Because dasatinib inhibits targets other than
BCR-ABL, alternative mechanisms have been suggested
to explain fluid retention or pleural effusion during dasatinib treatment, including potent inhibition of PDGFRb leading to a reduction in interstitial fluid pressure or
inhibition of SRC-family kinases leading to changes in
vascular permeability.9
In addition to prior history of an immune-mediated
condition, other risk factors for the development of pleural effusion have been reported, including hypertension,
history of cardiac disease, pulmonary comorbidity, dasatinib dosage of more than 100 mg per day, and treatment
during advanced-phase CML.9,12,15 In this analysis, the
study protocol and information collected precluded a similar evaluation of comorbidities, although older age was
associated with an increased risk of pleural effusion. A previous univariate analysis also identified older age (more
than 60 years) as a risk factors for pleural effusion,
although there was no association during a subsequent
multivariate analysis.9
In the present analysis, a possible association was
observed between pleural effusion and lymphocytosis and
