Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is thought to play
a critical role in regulating cell growth, cell cycle progression,
and tumorigenesis. Because the AKT-mTOR pathway is
frequently hyperactivated in ovarian cancer, we hypothesized
that the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus) would inhibit
ovarian tumorigenesis in transgenic mice that spontaneously
develop ovarian carcinomas. We used TgMISIIR-TAg transgenic
mice, which develop bilateral ovarian serous adenocarcinomas
accompanied by ascites and peritoneal dissemination.
Fifty-eight female TgMISIIR-TAg mice were treated with
5 mg/kg RAD001 or placebo twice weekly from 5 to 20 weeks
of age. To monitor tumor development, mice were examined
biweekly using magnetic resonance microimaging. In vivo
effects of RAD001 on Akt-mTOR signaling, tumor cell proliferation, and blood vessel area were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. RAD001 treatment
markedly delayed tumor development. Tumor burden was
reduced by f84%. In addition, ascites formation, together
with peritoneal dissemination, was detected in only 21% of
RAD001-treated mice compared with 74% in placebo-treated
animals. Approximately 30% of RAD001-treated mice developed early ovarian carcinoma confined within the ovary,
whereas all placebo-treated mice developed advanced ovarian
carcinoma. Treatment with RAD001 diminished the expression
of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-derived cell
lines and inhibited angiogenesis in vivo . RAD001 also
attenuated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and
inhibited the invasiveness of tumor-derived cells. Taken
together, these preclinical findings suggest that mTOR inhibition, alone or in combination with other molecularly targeted
drugs, could represent a promising chemopreventive strategy
in women at high familial risk of ovarian cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Ovarian carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of cancer
death among women in the United States (1). Due to the
asymptomatic nature of early disease stages, f70% of cases have
spread beyond the ovary at diagnosis and the cure rate for these
patients is <20%. To improve survival, not only is there an urgent
need to develop improved chemotherapeutic agents but also for

novel chemoprevention strategies to prevent or delay disease
progression. However, development of chemoprevention strategies
for ovarian cancer has been delayed due, in part, to the lack of an
appropriate experimental model. Recently, a transgenic mouse
model of spontaneous epithelial ovarian cancer was developed by
expression of SV40 Tag/tag under transcriptional control of the
MISIIR promoter (2). Tumors arising in TgMISIIR-TAg mice
resemble poorly differentiated ovarian adenocarcinomas in women,
frequently accompanied by malignant ascites and peritoneal
spreading (2). SV40 Tag binds to and functionally inactivates p53
and Rb (3), which are frequently mutated in human ovarian cancer
(4). SV40 tag binds protein phosphatase PP2A and inhibits its
activity, resulting in activation of PI3K-AKT and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (3). Notably, AKT is frequently
hyperactivated in human ovarian cancer (5). Moreover, expression
of activated Akt in ovarian surface epithelial cells is sufficient to
induce tumor formation in p53-null mice (6), suggesting that Akt is
an important target for chemoprevention. Because elevated Akt
activity results in hypersensitivity to mTOR inhibition (7), TgMISIIRTAg-DR26 mice might serve as a valuable model to assess the
chemopreventive potential of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (Everolimus). In this report, we show that RAD001 markedly delays tumor
onset and progression in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. RAD001 and placebo were obtained from Novartis Pharma AG
(Basel, Switzerland). Anti–phosphorylated (phospho)-p70S6K, anti-p70S6K,
anti–phospho-AKT, anti-AKT, anti–phospho–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), anti-mTOR, anti–phospho-GSK3, anti–cleaved caspase-3, and
anti–matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling
(Beverly, MA). Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), anti–SV40
Tag antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti–
h-actin was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Anti–MMP-2 antibody for
immunohistochemistry was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti–
CD31/platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) from
PharMingen (San Diego, CA).
Transgenic mice. The ovarian pathology of female TgMISIIR-TAg
founder mice has been described (2). A stably breeding transgenic line,
TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26, was established via an affected transgenic male
founder. Transgenic female offspring develop bilateral epithelial ovarian
carcinoma with complete penetrance, surviving an average of 143 days.
Animal experiments were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and
Usage Committee in accordance with NIH guidelines. Mice were typed for
SV40 Tag by isolation of tail genomic DNA as described (2).
Drug preparation. RAD001 was formulated at 2% (w/v) in a microemulsion vehicle. For animal studies, RAD001 was diluted in double-distilled
water just before administration by gavage. For in vitro analyses, RAD001
was prepared in DMSO.
Chemoprevention study. At 5 weeks of age, female TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26
mice were assigned to two groups receiving either RAD001 (n = 29) or
placebo (n = 29). Treatment was given in 0.2 mL containing either 5 mg/kg

RAD001 or placebo twice weekly. Treatment was continued until 20 weeks
of age, when all mice were euthanized. The size of ovaries was measured
biweekly, using magnetic resonance microimaging (MRM). Weights were
recorded weekly. At the time of sacrifice, mice were examined for peritoneal
dissemination and ascites. Ovarian tumors and peritoneal implants were
analyzed histologically. Final ovarian tumor volumes were calculated as
follows: V = L  W  D  k/6, wherein V is volume, L is length, W is width,
and D is depth.
Magnetic resonance microimaging. MRM was done with a 7-Tesla
vertical wide-bore magnet, using a Bruker DRX 300 spectrometer with a
microimaging accessory. Mice were anesthetized by exposure to a mixture
of oxygen and isofluorane (2%) for 10 min, after which the isofluorane
concentration was reduced to 1%. Mice received a 0.2-mL gadoliniumdiethyl-enetriaminepentaacetic acid injection of 10:1 diluted Magnevist
(Berlex, Montville, NJ) contrast agent into the shoulder muscle immediately
before scanning. Mice were positioned with the spine in the center of the
image field of view. Images were made in sagittal and axial orientations with
0.5 mm slice thickness, 2.56 cm field of view, and 0.1 mm in-plane resolution, with four signal averages, and with 20 to 28 slices to cover the entire
upper abdomen. Images acquired in Paravision were converted to Analyze
format with the Bruker2analyze program. Tumor volumes were determined
by outlining ovaries using the freeware program MRIcro.6 Measured tumor
volume was plotted against actual tumor volume at euthanasia. Linear
regression analysis gave a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (P < 0.01).
Histologic analysis. Tumors were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, anti–SV40 TAg, anti–
phospho-p70S6K (Thr389), anti–phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti–phospho-mTOR
(Ser2448), anti–MMP-2, anti–CD31/PECAM-1, anti–Ki-67, and anti–cleaved
caspase-3 were used. Surrounding nonneoplastic stroma served as an
internal negative control. Staining was scored semiquantitatively, as described (8). Microvessel area was analyzed by anti-CD31 immunostaining (9).
Mouse ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Mouse ovarian carcinoma
(MOVCAR) cell lines were obtained from ascites of TgMISIIR-TAg mice
(2). Cell lines were cultured at 37jC in DMEM containing 4% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 1% 1 insulin, transferrin, and selenium, penicillin (100 units/
mL)/streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), and 2 mmol/L glutamine in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Western blot analysis. Cell lines derived from ascites were treated with
either DMSO (vehicle) or 20 nmol/L RAD001 for 0, 6, or 24 h. Cellular lysates
and Western blots were prepared as described (10). Immunoblots were
visualized with horseradish peroxidase–coupled goat anti–rabbit immunoglobulin or anti–mouse immunoglobulin using enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA).
Cell proliferation assay. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze the effect of RAD001
on cell viability in vitro (10). Cells were cultured overnight in 96-well plates
(104 per well). Cell viability was assessed by adding RAD001 at indicated
concentrations for 72 h. The number of surviving cells was estimated by
determining the A 490 nm of dissolved formazan product after addition of
MTT for 1 h based on the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison,
WI). All experiments were carried out in quadruplicate, and viability is
expressed as A exp group/A control  100.
In vitro cell invasion assay using matrigel. Invasiveness was analyzed
using a BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber kit (Becton Dickinson, Bedford,
MA). Cells (2.5  104) with or without 20 nmol/L RAD001 in serum-free
DMEM were seeded into transwell insert chambers containing a filter
coated with Matrigel, and the insert chamber was placed in the lower
compartment filled with DMEM with 4% FBS. Cells were incubated at 37jC
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Cells that invaded the lower side of the
filter were viewed microscopically and counted in random fields of view at
200 magnification. Invasiveness was expressed as the mean cell number
invading the lower side of the filter.
Statistical analysis. Body weight, tumor incidence, tumor volume,
ascites formation, microvessel area, cell proliferation, and MOVCAR cell

invasiveness were compared among RAD001-treated and control groups.
Wilcoxon two-sample test was used to analyze body weight, tumor volume
(estimated from MRM), and median time for tumors to reach 50 mm3.
Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze tumor incidence, ascites formation,
microvessel area, cell proliferation, and invasiveness. P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
Because this mouse model expresses SV40 tag in ovarian
epithelium (2), resulting tumor cells were expected to have
activation of the Akt-mTOR pathway. At 9 to 14 weeks of age,
some tumors were still confined within the ovary and strong
immunoreactivity for Tag, phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, and
phospho-p70S6K was detected (Fig. 1A), indicating that Akt-mTOR
signaling is activated even in early ovarian lesions. Similar results
were observed in more advanced tumors. Thus, TgMISIIR-TAgDR26 mice were deemed a useful preclinical model to test the
efficacy of RAD001 as an agent for early intervention/prevention of
ovarian cancer.
To determine if RAD001 suppresses tumorigenesis, TgMISIIRTAg-DR26 mice were treated with placebo or 5 mg/kg of RAD001
twice weekly. Because no obvious ovarian tumors were identified
at 5 to 6 weeks of age in a pilot study of TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26
mice, treatment was started at 5 weeks and continued to 20
weeks of age. Body weight of RAD001-treated mice was f10%
lower than in placebo-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which was attributed to the large size of tumors in control mice.
To rule out toxicity due to treatment with RAD001, a pathologist
(A.K.S.) did a histologic assessment of various organs (liver,
spleen, pancreas, kidney, small and large intestines, uterus, and
ovaries) from seven RAD001-treated mice, and no toxic changes
were observed.
Representative MRM images of ovarian tumors at 19 weeks of
age and necropsy photos of the same mice at 20 weeks of age are
shown in Fig. 1B. Figure 1C depicts time to tumor development
based on MRM scans. Although nearly all mice developed ovarian
tumors, RAD001 treatment significantly delayed tumor onset and
progression. Median time for ovaries to reach a volume of 50 mm3
was 90 days in the placebo group compared with >122 days in
RAD001-treated mice (Table 1). Median tumor burden measured at
time of euthanasia was 429.2 mm3 in controls versus 26.2 mm3 in
RAD001-treated mice; moreover, histologic analysis revealed early
ovarian tumors confined within the ovary in 32% of RAD001treated mice compared with 0% in controls.
Because ascitic fluid volume and size of disseminated tumors
correlate with patient prognosis and contribute to patient
malnutrition through loss of protein and/or suppressed appetite
(11), it is important to control dissemination of tumors and ascites
production. Ascites formation and peritoneal dissemination were
detected in 73.9% of placebo-treated mice but only 21.4% in
RAD001-treated mice (Table 1), demonstrating that RAD001
treatment during the early phase of spontaneous tumorigenesis
significantly delays tumor development.
Rapamycin inhibits mTOR’s ability to phosphorylate p70S6K and
4E-BP1, thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression of cancer cells (7).
To investigate the mechanism by which RAD001 inhibits tumorigenesis in TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26 mice, we conducted cell proliferation assays using MOVCAR5 and MOVCAR6 cells. Proliferation
was significantly inhibited by treatment with RAD001 in both lines
(Fig. 2A). Treatment with 20 nmol/L RAD001 markedly decreased
the number of Ki-67–positive cells and induced cleavage of PARP as

well (Supplementary Fig. S2). The apoptotic effect is noteworthy
given that rapamycin can induce apoptosis in some settings (7).
Immunostaining of tumor sections showed that RAD001 treatment
results in a marked decrease in Ki-67–positive cells but only a
modest increase in the number with immunoreactivity for cleaved
caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This suggests that RAD001
inhibits tumorigenesis in this model mainly by inhibiting cell
proliferation rather than by inducing apoptosis.
As shown in Fig. 2B, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K were phosphorylated
in MOVCAR cells, indicating activation of Akt-mTOR signaling.
Phosphorylation of p70S6K was significantly decreased by RAD001
treatment, indicating inhibited downstream signaling of mTOR. Similarly, ovarian tumors from RAD001-treated mice showed markedly
decreased phospho-p70S6K staining (Supplementary Fig. S4). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry revealed that RAD001 does
not affect expression of SV40 Tag (Supplementary Fig. S5).
VEGF is known to stimulate tumor angiogenesis and mediate
ascites formation (12). Because rapamycin can decrease expression
of VEGF in ovarian tumors (13), we tested whether RAD001 affects

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (6). March 15, 2007

the expression of VEGF in MOVCAR cells (Fig. 2C). VEGF
expression was found to be significantly inhibited by RAD001 in
both tested MOVCAR lines.
To examine if RAD001 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, distribution
of the endothelial marker CD31 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A). Large CD31-immunopositive vessels were
observed in tumors from placebo-treated mice, whereas fewer and
smaller vessels were observed in tumors from RAD001-treated
mice. There was a significant decrease of microvessel area in
RAD001-treated tumors compared with control tumors (Fig. 3B).
Thus, RAD001’s antitumor effect may be associated, in part, with
inhibition of angiogenesis.
MMP-2 expression is an early event in the invasiveness of
ovarian carcinoma (14). Elevated MMP-2 expression is associated
with tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential, ascites formation, peritoneal dissemination, and poor prognosis in patients with
ovarian cancer (14, 15). We found that MMP-2 is expressed in early
ovarian tumors from our mice (Fig. 1A). MMP-2 expression was
observed in both tested MOVCAR lines, and treatment with

RAD001 significantly attenuated expression of MMP-2 (Fig. 2D) and
inhibited cell invasion through Matrigel (Fig. 3C, D). These findings
are consistent with the fact that RAD001 inhibits tumor
dissemination and ascites production in TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26 mice.

Discussion
Our data show that mTOR inhibition markedly delays tumorigenesis in a murine model of ovarian cancer. Although RAD001
treatment did not reduce tumor incidence, it resulted in a
remarkable reduction in the number of mice with advanced
disease and inhibited ascites formation and peritoneal dissemination. These findings have important implications, because the cure
rate of patients with early ovarian cancer is nearly 90% compared
with <20% in patients with advanced disease (16).
However, some tumors in RAD001-treated mice escaped the
inhibitory effect of RAD001 and became large, indicating the
presence of an alternative proliferation pathway. Germane to this,
recent work indicates that a combination of rapamycin and a

MAPK inhibitor is necessary to inhibit the growth of ovarian
tumors that have two redundant proliferation signals (i.e., mTOR
and MAPK; ref. 17). In MOVCAR cells, both Akt-mTOR (Fig. 2B)
and MAPK pathways (Supplementary Fig. S6) are activated, likely
due to the expression of SV40 tag. Therefore, treatment with
RAD001 and a MAPK inhibitor might be more efficacious in
RAD001-resistant TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26 tumors.
Another possible reason why some tumors escaped the
inhibitory effect of RAD001 is that drug treatment may have
stimulated a survival pathway. Although RAD001 effectively
inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K, phosphorylation of Akt
(as well as mTOR and GSK3) was up-regulated by RAD001
treatment in MOVCAR cells and tumors (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S4). This is consistent with recent work demonstrating that
mTOR inhibition triggers a feedback mechanism that activates Akt,
which can then activate other downstream pathways that may
promote tumor growth (18). Thus, future studies are planned to
evaluate the chemopreventive efficacy of RAD001 combined with a
PI3K/Akt inhibitor using TgMISIIR-TAg-DR26 mice.

Chemoprevention will likely require long-term treatment. Thus,
a low toxicity profile is required for an effective chemopreventive
agent. RAD001 is approved in Europe as an immunosuppressive
agent in the solid organ transplantation setting, and there are
extensive safety data regarding long-term usage of RAD001 (19).
The dosage used in our study seemed to be well tolerated, with no
toxic changes evident histologically.
The risk of developing ovarian cancer is 30% to 60% in women
with BRCA1 mutations and 10% to 30% in those with BRCA2
mutations. Currently, prophylactic oophorectomy is the only way
to reduce lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in these women (20).
Whereas there is no clearly defined ovarian preneoplastic lesion,
phospho-AKT/phospho-mTOR immunostaining is frequently found

in inclusion cysts and other histologic lesions in ovaries removed
prophylactically from women with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations.7 Collectively, our findings suggest that mTOR inhibition
might be a useful strategy to prevent or delay onset of ovarian
cancer in women with hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome.
