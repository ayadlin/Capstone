ABSTRACT
Elucidating the targets and mechanism of action of natural products is
strategically important prior to drug development and assessment of potential
clinical applications. In this report, we elucidated the main targets and mechanism
of action of the natural product tonantzitlolone (TZL) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(CCRCC). We identified TZL as a dual PKC` and PKCθ activator in vitro, although in
CCRCC cells its activity was mostly PKCθ-dependent. Through activation of PKCθ,
TZL induced an insulin resistant phenotype by inhibiting IRS1 and the PI3K/Akt
pathway. Simultaneously, TZL activated the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription
factor driving glucose dependency. Thus, similar to the selective PKCθ activator
englerin A, TZL induces a metabolic catastrophe in CCRCC, starving cells of glucose
while simultaneously increasing their glycolytic dependency.

A (EA; C26H34O6) as a potent and selective PKCθ
activator [4]. This finding is furthering our understanding
of the role played by PKCθ in tumor tissues and
identifies PKCθ interaction with the heat shock factor 1
(HSF1) transcription factor as a critical link between cell
metabolism and cell stress response.
Tonantzitlolone (C26H40O7) is a diterpene ester
identified in 1990 from the native Mexican plant Stillingia
sanguinolenta Müll. Arg. (Euphorbiaceae). The initial
interest towards investigating S. sanguinolutea biomedical
properties comes from native Mexican, Navajo, and Creek
traditional use as a medicinal plant [5]. Reports have
since addressed TZL’s structure, absolute configuration,
and total synthesis [6, 5]. Although preliminary data
have suggested that TZL might have an anticancer effect,
a thorough characterization of the biological effects of
TZL is lacking and its targets as well as its mechanisms
of action are yet to be discovered. In this report, our goal
was to identify TZL primary targets and to characterize the
molecular effect of TZL on tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple signaling pathways are involved
in regulating cell metabolism. Several, including
components of the insulin pathway, are regulated by
members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. The
multiple isoforms of PKC directly or indirectly regulate
diverse aspects of metabolism in an isoform specific
manner [1, 2]. For example, PKCθ and -ε induce insulin
resistance by inhibiting insulin receptor substrate 1
(IRS1) and the insulin pathway, while PKCδ and -λ have
the opposite effect and stimulate the insulin pathway
by activating IRS1 [2]. PKC isoforms can also regulate
additional aspects of cell metabolism, e.g. PKCζ has
recently been shown to regulate glutamine metabolism
[3]. Therefore, developing isoform-specific regulators
of PKCs might have useful clinical applications
for metabolically deregulated diseases, including
most epithelial cancers. One example of this is the
recent identification of the natural product englerin

repository database CellMiner; NSC#339555) [11]. These
data suggest that the difference in toxicity might be due
to a variation in isoform selectivity, and that TZL’s effect
might be PKCθ-dependent.

Tonantzitlolone is a PKC activator with weak
isoform selectivity

Tonantzitlolone cytotoxicity in renal cancer cells
is PKCθ-dependent

Analysis of NCI 60 selectivity data indicated
that TZL had a pattern of response very similar to
englerin A, with a Pearson correlation of 0.91 at the
GI-50 level of response; Table 1 [8]. All other pure
compound correlations (n = 9) above 0.8 were to
englerin analogues, with one exception (#741581,
sodwanone W [7]). In addition, quantitative structure
activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that TZL
is structurally similar to the protein kinase C (PKC)
activator bryostatin 1 and analogues, suggesting that
TZL is likely to have an effect on the protein kinase
C (PKC) family (Tables 2 and 3; [8]). To validate
these results, we used a pan-PKC kinase assay. Whole
protein extracts of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(CCRCC) cell line 786-0 were directly treated with TZL
(5 μM; 1 h at 30°C). We used the anticancer agent EA,
a selective PKCθ activator [4], as a positive control.
This assay revealed that TZL is a potent PKC activator
(Figure 1A). Because of the variable functions of the
different PKC isoforms, we assessed TZL isoform
selectivity by in vitro kinase assay using purified
proteins. As shown in Figure 1B, TZL efficiently
activated PKCθ and PKCα, but not PKCδ.

We then sought to assess whether TZL cytotoxicity
was dependent on a particular PKC isoform. Because of the
direct effect of TZL on PKCθ and PKCα purified proteins
(Figure 1B), we separately silenced these two kinases in
786-0 and A498 cells using small interference RNA prior
to exposure to TZL. As shown in Figure 4A-B, silencing
of PKCθ partially rescued the cells from TZL cytotoxicity
while silencing of PKCα did not. This suggests that PKCθ
expression is necessary to mediate TZL cytotoxicity.
HEK293 cells are not sensitive to TZL (Figure 4A) and
express low levels of PKCθ compared to 786-0 and
A498, but express robust levels of PKCα (Figure 4B; [6]),
suggesting that TZL’s effect in CCRCC cells is likely
mediated by PKCθ. To further evaluate the effect of TZL
on PKCθ signaling pathway in CCRCC cells, we treated
786-0 and A498 CCRCC cell lines with TZL and assessed
the effect of treatment on the insulin pathway. As shown
in Figure 4C, TZL increased phosphorylation of IRS1 on
serine 1101 (a PKCθ-dependent phosphorylation site that
inhibits IRS1 activity) and decreased Akt phosphorylation.
Moreover, glucose uptake was also inhibited after TZL
treatment in a PKCθ-dependent manner (5 μM, 16 h;
Figure 4D), suggesting that TZL limits tumor cells access
to glucose by inducing an insulin resistant phenotype via
activation of PKCθ.
We previously established a link between PKCθ
and HSF1, a transcription factor known to induce
tumor glucose dependency [12, 13], namely direct
phosphorylation and heat-shock-independent activation
of HSF1 by PKCθ [4]. We thus investigated whether TZL
also induced a direct heat-shock-independent activation

Tonantzitlolone is a potent anti-tumor agent
To further assess the biologic effect of TZL on
the viability of tumor cells, we used the NCI-60 screen,
a platform containing 60 different cancer cell lines [9].
Interestingly, TZL displayed a preferred cytotoxicity
towards renal cancer cells (Figure 2). In a similar screen,
EA also displayed renal selectivity [10]; however this
was not seen with the pan-PKC activator bryostatin 1
(Figure 3; bryostatin’s data were extracted from the public

of HSF1. Using an in vitro kinase assay with purified
PKCθ and HSF1 proteins, we demonstrated that TZL was
able to induce PKCθ-dependent HSF1 phosphorylation
(Figure 5A). Furthermore treatment of 786-0 cells with
TZL (5 μM, 24 h) increased HSF1 transcriptional activity
as measured with a luminescence-reporter plasmid assay
(Figure 5B) and similarly to effects observed with EA,
TZL cytotoxicity was observed only when HSF1 and
PKCθ were simultaneously overexpressed in HEK293
cells (Figure 5C-5D). Also, TZL’s cytotoxicity was
dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration
(Figure 5E). Indeed, in low glucose media (1 g/L), TZL

mechanisms regulating the metabolism of cancer cells
has shed a new light on the role of PKC in regulating
metabolic processes, especially in tumor cells. Here
we report that the natural product TZL is a potent PKC
activator with tumor cytotoxicity that is mostly mediated
by the novel PKC isoform PKCθ. By activating PKCθ,
TZL inhibits the insulin pathway while activating HSF1
and glucose dependency.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most
common type of both sporadic and hereditary kidney
cancer. It is primarily induced by mutations occurring
in the tumor suppressor gene VHL [14]. Defective
VHL protein expression leads to stabilization of

hypoxia-inducible factors 1and 2 [15, 16], increased
DNA damage [17], and to activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway stimulating cell proliferation and tumor growth
[18]. Thus VHL-deficient cells display a pseudo-hypoxic
phenotype with a restructured metabolism oriented
toward aerobic glycolysis and favoring anabolic growth
[12]. Interestingly, PKC members have been shown
to be induced by hypoxia and novel PKC isoforms
are known to interact with VHL, suggesting that VHL
might directly regulate the expression of some of the
PKC isoforms. Also, besides a well-characterized role
in regulating cell cycle and survival [19, 20, 21], PKC
isoforms are also critical in regulating metabolic

processes [2, 3]. Hence, CCRCC cells are useful tools
for studying PKC isoform functions.
Although structurally different from the natural
product EA [5, 10], TZL has a similar profile in the
NCI-60 screen suggesting that the two compounds might
share a similar mechanism of action. Using in vitro kinase
assays, we showed that TZL activated PKCθ and not
PKCδ and that its cytotoxicity was PKCθ dependent in
CCRCC cells. Because of the limited expression profile
of PKCθ to some solid tumors and immune cells, and
the fact that HSF1 is often overexpressed in tumors, TZL
might only be lethal to PKCθ-expressing, HSF1- addicted
glycolytic tumor cells.
Despite the well-characterized role of HSF1 in
cancer development and progression [13, 12, 22, 23],
in the context of PKCθ activation and the inhibition of
the insulin pathway, non-heat-shock HSF1 activation
appears to provide a therapeutic advantage. HSF1 is a
tumor growth facilitator that enhances tumor glucose
dependence via a heat-shock-independent transcriptional
program [12]. Since TZL activates HSF1 and its
cytotoxicity is inversely related to extracellular glucose
concentration (Figure 5E), the fact that HSF1 increases
glucose dependency might provide a rationale for why
activation of HSF1 underlies the cytotoxicity of PKCθ
activators such as TZL.
In conclusion, our data suggest that TZL and the
PKCθ activator EA share a similar mechanism of action
in CCRCC cell lines—that is PKCθ activation that leads to
a metabolic catastrophe by simultaneously inhibiting the
insulin pathway via inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS1
while inducing glucose addiction via HSF1 activation.
These data also further support PKCθ as a strategic
therapeutic target for patients with highly glycolytic
tumors, such as CCRCC.
