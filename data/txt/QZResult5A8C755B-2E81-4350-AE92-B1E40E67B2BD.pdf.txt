ABSTRACT
Aberrations in the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) axis are frequently
reported in cancer. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we
identified several point mutations in MTOR and its upstream regulator RHEB (Ras
homolog enriched in brain) in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the
most common histology of kidney cancer. Interestingly, we found a prominent cluster
of hyperactivating mutations in the FAT (FRAP-ATM-TTRAP) domain of mTOR in renal
cell carcinoma that led to an increase in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities and led
to an increased proliferation of cells. Several of the FAT domain mutants demonstrated
a decreased binding of DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein),
while a subset of these mutations showed altered binding of the negative regulator
PRAS40 (proline rich AKT substrate 40). We also identified a recurrent mutation
in RHEB in ccRCC patients that leads to an increase in mTORC1 activity. In vitro
characterization of this RHEB mutation revealed that this mutant showed considerable
resistance to TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2) GAP (GTPase activating protein) activity,
though its interaction with TSC2 remained unaltered. Mutations in the FAT domain
of MTOR and in RHEB remained sensitive to rapamycin, though several of these
mutations demonstrated residual mTOR kinase activity after treatment with rapamycin
at clinically relevant doses. Overall, our data suggests that point mutations in the
mTOR pathway may lead to downstream mTOR hyperactivation through multiple
different mechanisms to confer a proliferative advantage to a tumor cell.

INTRODUCTION

efforts have identified point mutations in MTOR in various
cancers, though it remains to be assessed if these are
driver mutations causally implicated in oncogenesis [3,
4]. Understanding the regulation of the mTOR pathway is
of paramount importance in renal cancer as inhibitors of
mTOR (everolimus and temsirolimus) which are structural
analogs of rapamycin are clinically approved for the
treatment of advanced metastatic cancer.
The mTOR protein exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 [5]. RAPTOR

mTOR is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that
integrates intracellular and extracellular signals to regulate
vital cellular processes such as growth, proliferation and
metabolism [1]. One of the primary characteristics of a
tumor cell is its ability to disconnect growth-promoting
processes from the perception of growth signals. Hence it
is not surprising that elevated mTOR signaling has been
detected in several cancers [2]. Recent deep sequencing

RESULTS

(regulatory associated protein of mTOR) and RICTOR
(rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) are
unique scaffolding proteins that assemble the complexes
and bind the substrates for mTORC1 and mTORC2,
respectively [6, 7]. Unique components also exist in
each complex: mTORC1 comprises a negative regulator,
PRAS40, whereas mTORC2 contains PROTOR (protein
observed with rictor 1 and 2) and mSIN1(mammalian
stress-activated map kinase-interacting protein 1) [8-10].
mTORC1 and mTORC2 share mLST8(mammalian lethal
with sec-13) and the negative regulator DEPTOR [11,
12]. The complex in which mTOR participates dictates
the substrate specificity of its kinase activity. S6K1 (S6
Kinase 1) and 4E-BP1 (eIF-4E binding protein 1) are two
well-characterized mTORC1 substrates that associate with
mRNAs and regulate both mRNA translation initiation and
progression, thus enhancing protein synthesis [13, 14]. As
such, mTOR is normally subject to stringent regulation
by nutrient conditions [15]. The heterodimer consisting
of TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1; also known as hamartin)
and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis 2; also known as tuberin)
is a key upstream regulator of mTORC1 and functions
as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RHEB [16].
The GTP-bound form of RHEB directly interacts with
mTORC1 and strongly stimulates its kinase activity. As
a RHEB GAP, TSC1/2 negatively regulates mTORC1 by
converting RHEB into its inactive GDP-bound state [17].
mTORC2 substrates include members of the AGC (protein
kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family that
regulate cell survival and cell cycle progression. One
of the most well characterized downstream targets of
mTORC2 is AKT. mTORC2 directly activates AKT by
phosphorylating its hydrophobic motif (Ser473), a site
required for its maximal activation [18].
Using publicly available databases of cancer genome
sequence data, we examined a cluster of mutations in
MTOR specific to RCC located in the FAT domain of
mTOR and a point mutation in the RHEB gene [19, 20].
These activating mutations demonstrate that multiple
mechanisms may lead to mTOR hyperactivation. Our data
demonstrate that mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR
promote mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Morevoer, we
demonstrate that cancer-associated MTOR mutations in
the FAT domain confer a proliferative advantage over
wild type MTOR. Finally, our data demonstrate that these
mutations can promote persistent mTOR activity despite
rapalog therapy. Therefore, these data have clinical
implications given the widespread use of rapalog therapy
for advanced RCC and the high prevalence of MTOR
mutations in this malignancy.

Point mutations are clustered in various
regulatory domains of mTOR in ccRCC patients
and are associated with poor prognosis
We analyzed cancer genomic sequence data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the COSMIC
(the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) (http://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk) and cBIO Cancer genomics portal
[19-21] and found that mutations in MTOR were prevalent
in about 6% of the patients with ccRCC while mutations
in RHEB are relatively uncommon and present in about
1% of the patients with RCC. As with other cancers, some
of these mutations clustered in key regulatory domains of
mTOR such as the kinase domain and the FRB (FKBP12
rapamycin binding) domains (Table 1 and Figure 1a).
Mapping the RCC-associated mutations on the threedimensional structure of mTOR (PDB ID code: 4JSN)
reveals a cluster of mutations within the core of the kinase
domain, as well as several mutations distributed across the
surface of the kinase domain that mediate interactions with
the FAT domain (Figure 1b).
The recently elucidated crystal structure of mTOR
[22] revealed that the FAT domain contains 28 α-helices
arranged as α-α-helical repeats (Figure 1b). Helices α1 to
α22 belong to the Tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat family
and form three discontinuous domains (TRD1, TRD2 and
TRD3). Helices α23 to α28 belong to the HEAT family
and form a single domain (HRD). The four domains pack
sequentially to form a ‘C’-shaped α-solenoid that wraps
halfway around the kinase domain and clamps onto it.
mLST8 and the FRB domain protrude from the kinase
domain, on opposite sides of the catalytic cleft. The FATC
domain is integral to the kinase domain structure.TRD1
interacts with the C lobe on one side of the kinase domain,
and after TRD2 and TRD3 traverse to the other side, the
HRD interacts with both the N lobe and the C lobe of the
kinase domain.
The mutations cluster in the first of three
discontinuous domains (TRD1), which forms intimate
interactions with the C-lobe of the kinase domain. This
led us to hypothesize that mutations in the FAT domain of
mTOR may lead to deregulation of mTOR kinase activity,
possibly by disrupting autoinhibitory interactions and/or
scaffolding sites for accessory proteins associated with
the mTOR complexes. Interestingly, sequence data from
418 ccRCC patients analyzed by the cBIO portal revealed
that patients with mTOR mutations exhibited a significant
decrease in overall survival (Figure 1c) suggesting that
mutations in MTOR have prognostic significance.

cluster in key regulatory domains, such as the FRB and
kinase domains of mTOR. However, very little is known
about the regulatory roles of other domains of mTOR
and how mutations in them could alter global mTOR
function and complex assembly. Based on these findings,
we focused on the FAT domain cluster of MTOR mutants
and compared its in vitro effects to another previously
characterized mutant (R2505P) in the kinase domain [23].
To assess the sensitivity of FAT domain mutants of
mTOR to upstream signaling by nutrients, we examined the
effect of these mutations under nutrient replete conditions
and in the absence of both serum and amino acids. We find

Two previous reports have examined the role of
mTOR mutations in cancer. In the first report, the authors
examined six hyperactivating mutations reported in
various cancers and identified a hyperactivating mutation
(R2505P) in RCC [23]. In the second report, the authors
examined the effects of recurrent mutations in various
domains of mTOR and analyzed them with respect to
their sensitivity to rapamycin [24]. Intuitively, most of the
mutations reported in various cancer genome databases

that FAT domain mutants promote mTORC1 activation
as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylation of
endogenous S6K and its downstream target S6, relative to
wild-type mTOR (Figure 2a and 2b, Supplemental Figures
1- 3). These data are consistent with studies by Grabiner et
al. which demonstrated that mTOR FAT domain mutants
promoted phosphorylation of a cotransfected S6K1 cDNA
construct [24]. Although the mTOR pathway is subject to
regulation by nutrient conditions, recent studies indicate
that mTORC1 phosphorylation sites have differential
sensitivity to nutrients and rapamycin. The substrate
quality affects how mTORC1 substrates respond to both
pharmacological and natural regulators of the kinase.
For example, sites such as S6K Thr389 and 4E-BP1
Ser65 are nutrient sensitive whereas 4E-BP1 Thr37/47
is relative resistant to regulation by nutrient conditions
and rapamycin [25]. Our data demonstrate that mTOR
FAT domain mutants promote 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
at the nutrient sensitive site Ser65 in the presence of
nutrients (Figure 2c, Supplemental Figures 1-3). FAT
domain mutants also promote increased phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 at the nutrient resistant Thr 37/46 residue in
both the presence and absence of serum and amino acids
(Figure 2d, Supplemental Figure 3). Similar findings at

Thr 37/46 were found in HeLa and NIH/3T3 cells under
nutrient replete conditions (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).
Overall, our data demonstrate that point mutations in the
FAT domain lead to activation at both rapamycin/nutrient
sensitive and resistant outputs of mTORC1.

Point mutations in the FAT domain of mTOR lead
to increased mTORC2 in vitro kinase activity
mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been shown to play
critical yet functionally distinct roles. While the functional
consequences of mTORC1 activation and its downstream
targets are well defined, the role of mTORC2 activation
in general and its role in tumorigenesis is less established.
Prior reports that have examined point mutations in
mTOR, demonstrate mTORC1 activation [23, 26]. In
general, we found that FAT domain mutants led to a
modest increase in mTORC2 activity as determined by
ser473 phosphorylation of AKT (Figure 3a). Basal AKT
phosphorylation at Ser473 is high in HEK293T cells.
Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in the carboxy-terminal
hydrophobic motif, either by mTOR [18] or by DNAPK [27], stimulates full AKT activity. While mTORC2
is primarily responsible for this phosphorylation event,

mTOR hyperactivating mutants demonstrate
increased rates of cell proliferation

Ser473 phosphorylation is a more accurate marker of
PI3K activity than mTORC2 [28]. Moreover, alternate
kinases may promote phosphorylation at this site [29].
We therefore examined de novo AKT phosphorylation by
mTORC2 by an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant
AKT as a substrate. Our data clearly demonstrate that
FAT domain mutations of mTOR lead to an increase in
mTORC2 kinase activity relative to wild-type mTOR
(Figure 3b). Interestingly, several of the point mutants
that were previously reported to selectively phosphorylate
mTORC1 substrates(L1460P, C1483F, and R2505P)
clearly demonstrate increased mTORC2 kinase activity
relative to wild-type mTOR (Figure 3b) [24].

mTOR has emerged as a critical node through
which cells coordinate growth signals and nutrient
availability to the macromolecular synthesis of proteins,
lipids and nucleic acids [30]. mTORC1 coordinates
mRNA translation by phosphorylating components of
the translational machinery: the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs) and the
ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) 1 and 2 [31]. It has been
proposed that, while the 4E-BPs mediate cell proliferation
downstream of mTORC1, the S6Ks regulate cell growth
through complementary but distinct mechanisms [32]. As
mTOR is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation,
we examined the effect of mutations in the FAT domain

of mTOR on cell proliferation. In vitro, HEK293T cells
expressing the mTOR FAT domain mutants K1452N,
L1460P, C1483Y, and A1519T showed significantly
higher rates of cell proliferation in comparison to cells
expressing wild-type mTOR, similar to the kinase domain
mutant R2505P (Figure 4). Our data demonstrates for
the first time that mTOR FAT domain mutants confer a
proliferative advantage relative to wild-type mTOR.

mutants demonstrated a loss of PRAS40 binding. Our
data thus suggests that some of the mutations in the FAT
domain of mTOR may preferentially lead to an increased
phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates due to loss of
PRAS40 binding.
In addition, we also observed an alteration in the
levels of RICTOR in the immunoprecipitates from
mutant mTOR in comparison to its wild-type counterpart
(Figure 5). RICTOR is a conserved scaffolding protein
that regulates the recruitment of substrates to the
mTORC2 complex [18, 34]. Our mTORC2 complex
immunoprecipitation data correlates with our results from
the in vitro kinase assay in that mutants with higher in
vitro kinase activity (L1433S, L1460P, and C1483Y) have
high RICTOR levels in immunproprecipitates. Notably,
the R2505P mutant did not demonstrate an increase in
RICTOR binding. These data indicate that mutations in
the FAT domain of mTOR may lead to an overall increase
in mTORC2 kinase activity due to better recruitment of
mTORC2 substrates via enhanced RICTOR association.
As previously reported, we observed a loss of DEPTOR
binding in several of the FAT domain mutants relative
to wild-type mTOR (Figure 5) [24]. As DEPTOR is an
intrinsic inhibitor common to mTORC1 and mTORC2
complexes, these findings further substantiate our
results from the mTORC2 in vitro kinase assay. Overall,
the immunoprecipitation experiments from cells over

mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants demonstrate
differential complex assembly
One potential mechanism by which mutations
in mTOR might impact kinase activity is by altering
mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex assembly. To test this
hypothesis, we transiently overexpressed wild-type and
mutant mTOR in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated
the mTOR complex using the myc epitope. In contrast to
the previous findings, we observed that a few of the FAT
domain mutants (L1460P and C1483Y) had lower levels
of RAPTOR in the immunoprecipitates in comparison to
wild-type mTOR (Figure 5) [24]. By binding to RAPTOR,
PRAS40 is known to regulate mTORC1 kinase activity by
functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding [33].
We examined the immunoprecipitates from wild-type and
mutant mTOR for levels of PRAS40. Notably, the same

mutations in mTOR may act through several mechanisms
to increase the phosphorylation of downstream mTORC1
and mTORC2 targets.

mutants. To assess the sensitivity of mTOR mutants to
rapalogs, we treated the cells with rapamycin at 10nM
which is comparable to trough levels of patients with
advanced RCC treated with everolimus [37]. While the
mTORC1 activity of FAT domain mutants was inhibitable
by rapamycin, multiple mutants demonstrated residual
activity as determined by S6K phosphorylation (Figure
6a). With higher doses of rapamycin, this residual activity
could be abolished (Figure 6b). To assess the sensitivity of
these mutants to rapamycin we also measured proliferation
of these cells expressing mutant mTOR relative to wildtype over expressing cells in the presence of rapamycin.
Notably, HEK293T cells expressing FAT domain mutants
(L1460P and C1483Y) demonstrated higher rates of cell
proliferation in comparison to wild-type mTOR expressing
cells in the presence of clinically relevant doses of
rapamycin (Figure 6c).

FAT domain mutations in mTOR confer relative
resistance to mTOR pathway inhibitors
Recent studies have indicated that mutations of
the mTOR pathway may have therapeutic implications.
This is particularly relevant as rapalogs are currently
used for the treatment of advanced RCC [35]. Prior
studies in cell lines have implicated mTOR mutations
as conferring sensitivity to rapamycin [24]. However, a
recent case report implicated mTOR mutation (F2108L) as
a mechanism of acquired resistance to allosteric inhibition
by the rapalog everolimus [36]. These data prompted us
to examine the effects of rapamycin on mTORC1 activity
in cells expressing the hyperactivating FAT domain

A point mutation in RHEB leads to mTOR
activation in a subset of patients with RCC

through the Rag family of GTPases, by mediating the
activation of mTOR by RHEB at the lysosome [12, 40].
Our analysis of cancer genome databases, also led us to
identify a recurrent point mutation in RHEB (Y35N),
reported in RCC and in several other cancers [41, 42].
RHEB is responsive to growth factors, but, in conjunction
with PLD1 (phospholipase D1), is also an integral part
of the machinery that stimulates mTORC1 in response
to amino acids [43]. In the simplest model, GTP-bound

In the abundance of growth factors activation of
the PI3K(phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) activates and
phosphorylates AKT, that in turn leads to the downstream
phosphorylation of TSC2 and inhibits its GAP activity
towards RHEB, allowing RHEB to activate mTOR [38,
39]. Amino acids on the other hand signal to mTORC1

RHEB either stimulates the kinase activity of mTORC1
via direct interaction or induces a conformational change
in mTORC1 that results in enhanced substrate turnover
[44]. RHEB has an unusually slow intrinsic GTPase
activity, which is regulated by the GAP activity of TSC2

[45]. Previous data utilizing site-directed mutagenesis,
crystallography, and real-time NMR-based GTPase
assays suggest that RHEB Tyr35 is a structurally critical
residue that is highly conserved across the small GTPase
superfamily [46], but has unique functions in RHEB.

Tyr35 was found to maintain the high activation state of
RHEB by inhibiting intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, however it
was also found to be required for sensitivity to the GAP
activity of TSC2 [47].
To assess the role of a point mutation in RHEB
at the conserved Tyr35 site, we generated a point
mutation (Y35N) and transiently over expressed wildtype and mutant RHEB in HEK293T cells. As RHEB
is a key mediator of the amino acid sensing mechanism
of the cell, we examined the effect of this mutant in the
presence and absence of amino acids. Mutant RHEB
caused promoted mTORC1 activation under nutrient
containing conditions, an effect that remained under
nutrient deprived conditions as demonstrated by persistent
phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP1 (Figure 7a). RHEB
stimulates mTORC1 phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1 in a rapamycin- sensitive manner [48]. To determine
the mechanism by which a point mutation in RHEB
might lead to downstream mTORC1 activation, we first
examined whether mutant RHEB altered assembly of
mTOR complexes by immunoprecipitating endogenous
mTOR complexes using an anti-mTOR antibody from
cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant RHEB. As
expected, overexpression of mutant RHEB did not alter
the association of RAPTOR or RICTOR, indicating
the mutation does not impact mTORC1 or mTORC2
assembly, respectively (Figure 7b).
The TSC1/TSC2 complex interacts with RHEB
and inactivates it through the activity of a GAP domain
in TSC2. Thus we performed immunoprecipitation
experiments to analyze the interactions of wild-type and
mutant FLAG-tagged RHEB with TSC2. The RHEB
mutation did not affect interaction with TSC2 (Figure
7b). RHEB has very low intrinsic GTPase activity and
our previous results have shown that the Y35 residue
autoinhibits intrinsic GTP hydrolysis [47]. Using a realtime NMR-based GTPase assay, we previously found that
mutation of Y35 to alanine or phenylalanine disrupted
this autoinhibitory mechanism and accelerated intrinsic
GTP hydrolysis several fold, while simultaneously
rendering it insensitive to the GAP activity of TSC2 [47].
Similar to the engineered Y35A and Y35F mutations, we
found that the cancer-associated Y35N RHEB mutation
increased the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by ~2.5
fold, due to release of the autoinhibitory function of Y35.
Subsequently we tested the sensitivity of the GTPase
activity of Y35N RHEB to the action of the TSC2 GAP
domain. While the rate of GTP hydrolysis of wild-type
RHEB was increased 50-fold in the presence of the GAP
domain of TSC2, the Y35N mutant exhibited complete
resistance to the GAP domain of TSC2 with no detectable
effect on GTP hydrolysis (Figure 7c). As expected, the
RHEB mutant demonstrated somewhat higher levels of
intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, however acquired resistance to
the GAP activity of TSC2 has a more profound impact
of RHEB function, thus leading to hyperactivation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTORC1 under starvation conditions where TSC2 is
active.
RHEB activation of S6K and 4E-BP1 is known to
be rapamycin-sensitive [48]. To determine the rapamycin
sensitivity associated with this RHEB mutant, we
transiently overexpressed wild-type and mutant RHEB
and examined the phosphorylation of mTOR targets after
acute rapamycin treatment. While mTORC1 activity in
cells expressing the RHEB mutant remained sensitive
to rapamycin, higher levels of phosphorylated S6K after
rapamycin treatment were observed with the mutant than
wild-type RHEB (Figure 7d).

DISCUSSION
mTOR deregulation is observed in multiple sporadic
cancer types; however, it also plays a causative role
in various familial tumor syndromes such as Cowden
syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and Tuberous
Sclerosis as recently summarized [49]. In sporadic cancers,
mTOR activation is frequently the result of amplification/
activating mutations in genes encoding upstream RTK’s
(receptor tyrosine kinases [50] , activating mutations of
PI3KCA (i.e., the gene encoding the PI3K catalytic subunit
p110α) [51] or deletion/inactivation of tumor suppressors,
including PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) [52] ,
LKB1 (liver kinase B1) [53], and the protein phosphatase
PP2A, which dephosphorylates and inactivates AKT [54].
Recent cancer genome sequencing efforts have led
to the identification of point mutations in mTOR. In this
study, we chose to characterize a group of mutations in the
TRD1 and TRD2 regions of the FAT domain that cluster
distal from the kinase domain. While mutations in these
regions could directly disrupt the binding sites for mTOR
complex proteins that interact with the FAT domain, these
mutation sites are not surface exposed. The FAT domain
is comprised of helices arranged in α-α-helical repeats
that form a C-shaped solenoid that surrounds the kinase
domain. These mutation sites are found at the interfaces
between adjacent helices, thus we propose these RCCassociated mutations are likely to destabilize the structure
of the FAT domain. This may directly deregulate mTOR
kinase activity as well as affect the binding of mTOR
complex proteins. The binding of DEPTOR, which
interacts with the FAT domain, was impaired by four
of the six mutations characterized in this study. The
side chain of L1433 in α3 is involved in hydrophobic
interactions with the alkyl region of K1452 in α4, which
appears to stabilize the orientation of helices 3 and 4, and
would be disrupted by the L1433S or K1452N mutations.
Likewise, the side chains of Y1463 in α5 and C1483
in α6 are intimately involved in the α5-α6 interhelical
packing, which could be disrupted by loss of an aromatic
ring (Y1463S) or steric clashes (C1483F). L1460 is in the
middle of α5, thus its mutation to the helix-breaker residue
proline would be expected to destabilize these helical

MTOR mutation is a mechanism of acquired resistance
to rapalog therapy [55]. Sequencing of the pretreatment
tumor demonstrated a nonsense TSC2 mutation. After
significant response to everolimus, the patient developed
resistant tumor that had a MTOR kinase domain mutation
(F2108L). Such resistance may occur in the setting of FAT
domain mutations and could occur via several mechanisms
as supported by our data. First, higher doses of rapamycin
may be required to ablate rapamycin sensitive outputs
of mTORC1. Prior in vitro studies have examined the
rapamycin sensitivity of mTORC1 activation mediated by
mTOR point mutants. However, in many cases, the doses
used are much higher than serum rapalog levels in patients
undergoing treatment in the setting of advanced RCC.
The recent case report in thyroid cancer demonstrated
persistent mTORC1 activity of the F2108L mutant at
physiologically relevant rapamycin concentrations is
consistent with our studies of FAT domain mutants.
Additionally, it is now well established that there are
mTORC1 activities that are not inhibitable by rapamycin.
Our data demonstrate enhanced phosphorylation of such
(e.g. 4E-BP1 Thr 37/46). Finally, mTOR FAT domain
mutants can promote mTORC2 kinase activity- a critical
finding given that rapalogs generally do not ablate
mTORC2 activity [56]. Hence, our findings suggest that
alternative strategies may need to be considered in the
setting of MTOR mutation. Dosing adjustments could be
considered. Alternatively, strategies that target rapamycin
resistant activities of mTOR mediated by mTORC1 or
mTORC2 (e.g ATP competitive inhibitors) could be
considered.
In summary, our findings shed new insight into
the biology of mTOR as it pertains to kidney cancer.
While mTOR is one of the largest genes in the human
genome, the mutations in mTOR are clustered within
finite regulatory domains suggesting that these mutations
lead to a gain of function which is currently an area of
active investigation. Characterizing these mutations and
their sensitivity to targeted agents could thus be clinically
relevant, especially with the increasing use of whole
genome sequencing to direct therapy in patients with
advanced cancer.

bundles, as would the adjacent mutation A1459P. A1519,
located in α8, packs into a small cavity formed by α7 that
would not accommodate a larger sidechain. Thus the α7α8 this bundle would likely be disrupted by the A1519T
mutation. Mechanistically, we find that in addition to
altering mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex assembly, FAT
domain mutations also lead to a decrease in PRAS40 and
DEPTOR binding, suggesting that multiple mechanisms
may act in concert to activate downstream mTOR targets.
Additionally, we examined a recurrent point
mutation in RHEB that caused mTORC1 hyperactivation
by conferring resistance to the GAP activity of TSC2.
Mutations in RHEB are uncommon in many cancers,
despite its central role in regulating downstream mTOR
activation. In RCC, a recurrent mutation in RHEB at the
Tyr35 residue has been reported, though it is unclear if
this mutation is mutually exclusive to mutations in TSC1
or TSC2 as the mutation frequencies amongst these genes
is low. The recurrent mutation of RHEB Y35 in cancers
underscores the importance of this residue, and illustrates
that the unique biochemical properties of RHEB lead to a
different mutational hotspot relative to RAS, in which the
majority of mutations affect G12, G13 and Q61. Indeed,
the equivalent positions in RHEB are either already
substituted in the wild-type sequence (R15 and S16), or
lack a catalytic function (Q64). It is notable that while
oncogenic RAS mutations synergistically impair both
intrinsic hydrolysis and GAP sensitivity, the RHEB Y35N
mutation enhances intrinsic hydrolysis but abolishes
sensitivity to the GAP. Overall, our results suggest that
mutations in the TSC-RHEB-mTOR signaling axis may
lead to a loss of inhibitory inputs thus conferring a survival
advantage to a dividing tumor cell.
Our findings have several implications for
patients with RCC. The finding that MTOR mutations
are associated with worsened outcomes has prognostic
relevance and suggests that this event may be a significant
contributor to tumor progression. Consistent with this
possibility is our data demonstrating the first evidence
that cancer-associated MTOR mutations promote a
proliferative advantage over wild type MTOR. The TCGA
data set are from primary RCC tumor samples. In the
setting of RCC, the morbidity and mortality is primarily
associated with disease outside the kidney. Hence, the
incidence of MTOR mutations may be much higher in
metastatic tumor sites which would further support a
role for this genetic alteration in tumor progression.
Additionally, our data may have therapeutic implications.
Approved mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus
serve as important therapeutic options within the current
RCC treatment paradigm, though they primarily target the
mTORC1 pathway. Biomarkers for rapamycin sensitivity/
resistance are lacking. Our results suggest that FAT
domain mutations may potentially lead to resistance to
rapalog therapy in patients with ccRCC. Notably, a recent
case report in anaplastic thyroid cancer suggests that

mTOR antibody (N-19, Santacruz). 40 µl of 50% slurry
of protein G-sepharose was then added and the incubation
continued for an additional 1 hour. Immunoprecipitates
were washed three times with ice-cold CHAPS lysis
buffer, denatured by the addition of 40 µl of sample buffer
and boiling for 5 minutes, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation
of FLAG tagged proteins lysates were prepared in lysis
buffer containing 1% Triton-X. Lysates with incubated
with 30 µl of 50% slurry of Anti-FLAG (M2) affinity gel
(Sigma) with rotation for 2 hours at 4°C. Finally, the beads

washed four times with the CHAPS-containing lysis
buffer and once with the rictor-mTOR kinase buffer (25
mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm
MgCl2). For kinase reaction, immunoprecipitates were
incubated in a final volume of 15 μl at 37 °C for 20 min
in the rictor-mTOR kinase buffer containing 500 ng of
inactive AKT1-GST and 500 μM ATP. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 235 μl of ice-cold dilution
buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3%
CHAPS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml
BSA). After a quick spin, the supernatant was removed
from the protein G-agarose, and a 15-μl portion was
analyzed by immunoblotting for Ser(P)473-Akt and total
Akt detection. The pelleted protein G-agarose beads were
also analyzed by immunoblotting to determine the levels
of myc in the immunoprecipitates.

Constructs encoding wild-type and Y35N human
RHEB (residues 1-169) were subcloned into PGEX2T
to generate thrombin-cleavable GST fusion proteins.
As described previously [60], 15N RHEB was expressed
in in E. coli BL21 DE3 Codon+ grown in M9 minimal
media supplemented with 15N ammonium chloride, and
purified on glutathione-Sepharose, released from the
resin by thrombin cleavage followed by gel filtration
chromatography on Sephadex-75 resin (GE Healthcare).
To assay GTP hydrolysis, 15N-Rheb was loaded with
GTP in the presence of EDTA, and excess nucleotide
and EDTA were removed by passing the sample through
a desalting column (PD Midi-Trap G25, GE Healthcare)
(as previously described [47], and aliquots of 0.2 mM

N RHEB-GTP (residues 1-169) in NMR buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 10%
D2O, pH7) were snap frozen and stored at -80 ͦC. The assay
was initiated by thawing a 35 µl sample, and successive
15
N 1H HSQC spectra (8 scans, 20 min each) were
collected at 15 ͦC on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR
spectrometer equipped with a 1.7 mm microcryoprobe.
Pairs of GTP/GDP-specific peaks from several residues
were used to evaluate the fraction of GTP-bound RHEB
remaining at each time point to obtain the half-life and
exchange rate as described previously [61].To assay the
GAP activity of TSC2 on wild-type and Y35N RHEB,
the GAP domain (residues 1525-1742) was prepared as
described previously [60] and added at a 1:2 molar ratio
to a 15N RHEB-GTP sample prior to collection of 15N 1H
HSQC spectra.
