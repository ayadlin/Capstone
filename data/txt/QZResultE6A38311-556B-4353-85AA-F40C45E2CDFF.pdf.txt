ABSTRACT
Tumor-initiating cell (TIC) is a subpopulation of cells in tumors that are
responsible for tumor initiation and progression. Recent studies indicate that
hepatocellular carcinoma-initiating cells (HCICs) confer the high malignancy,
recurrence and multi-drug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study,
we found that Icaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, inhibited
malignant growth of HCICs. Icaritin decreased the proportion of EpCAM-positive (a
HCICs marker) cells, suppressed tumorsphere formation in vitro and tumor formation
in vivo. We also found that Icaritin reduced expression of Interleukin-6 Receptors
(IL-6Rs), attenuated both constitutive and IL-6-induced phosphorylation of Janusactivated kinases 2 (Jak2) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(Stat3), and inhibited Stat3 downstream genes, such as Bmi-1 and Oct4. The inhibitory
activity of Icaritin in HCICs was augmented by siRNA-mediated silencing of Stat3 but
attenuated by constitutive activation of Stat3.Taken together, our results indicate that
Icaritin is able to inhibit malignant growth of HCICs and suggest that Icaritin may be
developed into a novel therapeutic agent for effective treatment of HCC.

INTRODUCTION

are main approaches to treat HCC while most of HCCs
are inoperable due to advanced stages. In addition, after
surgical resection, the long-term prognosis of HCC is
still poor and recurrence remains a major problem [3].
Chemotherapeutics, such as Cisplatin and its relatives,
are also used to treat patients with advanced stage of
HCC [4]. However, chemoresistance and drug toxicity in

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth
most common cancer type and the third leading cause of
cancer death worldwide [1]. Similar incidence of HCC
is observed in both developing and developed countries
[2].Currently, surgical resection and transplantation still

patients prevent long-term usage of these chemo drugs [4].
Therefore, alternative approaches using effective and less
toxic agents are urgently required for HCC treatment.
Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or tumor stem/
progenitor cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells that
have stem cell characteristics and are indispensable for
tumorigenesis. TICs are most resistant to conventional
cancer therapies such as chemo- and radio-therapy [5].
Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of TICs in
various cancers, from leukemia to solid tumors, such as
brain, colon, breast, prostate cancer and melanoma [6-10].
Recently, the expression of several molecular markers,
including EpCAM, CD133 and CD24, has been identified
as biomarkers for HCC initiating cells [11-13].
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(Stat3) stimulates diverse cellular process triggered by
several extracellular cytokines and growth factors, such
as IL-6 [14]. Activated by the Janus-activated kinases
(Jaks), Stat3 translocates to nucleus to induce expression
of target genes such as Mcl-1, and CyclinD1 [14]. The
IL-6/Stat3 pathway is involved in the development of
different types of solid tumor and the growth of TICs [15,
16]. In HCC, the IL-6/Stat3 signaling pathway is involved
in the maintenance and proliferation of HCICs [11, 17-19].
Recently, studies indicated that the stemness genes Bmi-1
and Oct4 are involved in HCC initiation [20, 21], and their
expression was up-regulated by the IL-6/Stat3 signaling
[22-24]. Therefore, agents that attenuate the IL-6/ Stat3
signaling pathway would potentially inhibit growth of
HCICs.
Icaritin is a prenylflavonoid derivative from
Epimedium Genus that has been used in Chinese
traditional medicine for long time. Previous studies were
mainly focused on Icaritin’s activities in the protection
of neuron, the promotion of cardiac differentiation,
and the prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis
[25-27]. Recently, increasing evidence indicated that
Icaritin is a novel anti-cancer agent for different kind
of cancers. Icaritin inhibits the growth and enhances
the radio-sensitivity of breast cancer cells, induces
apoptosis of human endometria cancer cells, exhibits
potent growth inhibitory activity in chronic myeloid
leukemia, and suppresses renal cell carcinoma growth
[28-32]. In addition, in phase I study of Icaritin in human
HCC, five patients acquired partial response (PR) or
stable disease (SD) among thirteen HCC patients [33].
However, the potential therapeutic activities and the
underlying mechanism of Icaritin in HCC and especially
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in hepatocellular carcinoma initiating cells (HCICs) have
not been established yet. In this study, we investigated
the inhibitory function of Icaritin in the malignant growth
of HCC and demonstrated that this inhibition activity
functions through attenuating the IL-6Rs/Jak2/Stat3
signaling pathway.

RESULTS
Icaritin inhibits growth of HCC cells
Icaritin is a prenylflavonoid derivative and its
chemical structure is shown (Figure 1A) [28].We first
tested the effects of different concentrations of Icaritin on
growth of established HCC cell lines with the CCK8 assay.
We found that Icaritin effectively inhibited PLC/PRF/5
and Huh7 cells viability in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 1B, 1C Left). However, Icaritin exhibited
little inhibitory activity in the L02 normal hepatocyte
cell line (Figure 1D, Left). These results indicated that
Icaritin inhibits the growth of HCC cells but not normal
hepatocytes. However, the chemotherapy agent, Cisplatin,
exhibited strong growth inhibitory activity in HCC cells
as well as in L02 cells without selectivity (Figure 1B-1D,
Right). To determine whether Icaritin-induced growth
inhibition of HCC is through apoptosis, we performed
Annexin Vapoptosis assays. We found Icaritin induced cell
apoptosis with a dose-dependent manner in PLC/PRF/5
and Huh7 cells (Figure 1E, S1).

Icaritin reduces the population of HCC initiating
cells
TICs have been identified and characterized
using specific cell surface markers. CD34+ was used for
leukemia-initiating cells [7], and CD44+CD24- or ALDH1+
was used to enrich breast cancer-initiating cells [6, 7, 34].
EpCAM was identified as a marker for HCC initiating
cells (HCICs) and EpCAM+ HCC cells efficiently form
non-adherent spherical clusters of cells in vitro, termed
hepatospheres and efficiently initiate tumors in NOD/
SCID mice [13]. Thus, we sought to assess whether
Icaritin reduces the EpCAM+ population in HCC cells.
We found that Icaritin efficiently decreased the EpCAM+
proportion in both PLC/PRF/5 and Huh7 cells in a dose31928

dependent fashion (Figure 2A, 2B, and S2). Icaritin at 3
μM started to reduce EpCAM+ cells, and at 10 μM Icaritin
generated over 60% reduction of EpCAM+ cells compared
to the vehicle–treated cells (Figure 2A, 2B). Cisplatin,
however, had no such effect (Figure 2A, 2B, and S2). The
steady state mRNA levels of other HCICs markers such as
CD133 and CD24 were also reduced by Icaritin (Figure
S3).
Next, we investigated the stem-like cell properties
of HCC after Icaritin treatment. First, we observed that
cells from Icaritin-treated group subsequently formed less
number and smaller size of hepatospheres than cells from
vehicle- or Cisplatin-treated group in vitro (Figure 2C, 2D
and S4). We then assessed the tumor-initiating ability of
the cells pre-treated with Icaritin. The results showed that
Icaritin pretreatment totally abolished tumor formation
in mice (Figure 2E, 2F). On the contrary, the cells pretreated with vehicle or Cisplatin still formed tumors
efficiently (Figure2E, 2F). Furthermore, serial transplant
tumorigenesis assay with cells from Icaritin-treated group
demonstrated Icaritin is able to reduce the population of
HCICs (Table1).

a dose-dependent manner with a similar kinetics to p-Stat3
(S727) (Figure S7A). The level of Stat3 phosphrylation at
the S727 residue was attenuated in the cells treated with
UO126, a MEK inhibitor (Figure S7B), suggesting Icaritin
blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation and then attenuated
phosphorylation of the Stat3 at S727. The expression of
the Stat3’s downstream genes, Mcl-1 and CyclinD1 were
also significantly reduced in the PLC/PRF/5 and Huh7
cells treated with Icaritin (Figure 3C).
Sorafenib is a chemical drug currently used for
HCC treatment and it was reported that Sorafenib inhibits
the activation of the Stat3 signaling [36]. Sorafenib
reduced HCC cell viability dose-dependently and the
IC50 of Sorafenib and Icaritin is about 2.5 μM and 5
μM, respectively (Figure S8A). Like Icaritin, Sorafenib
also inhibited HCICs (Figure S8B). In Figure 3D, we
show that both Sorafenib and Icaritin attenuated Stat3
phosphorylation at Y705 and reduced the expression
of Stat3 downstream genes, Mcl-1 and CyclinD1. At
IC50 concentrations, Icaritin reduced Stat3 (S727)
phosphorylation more potently than Sorafenib in HCC.
The chemotherapy agent, Cisplatin was not able to
influence Stat3 phosphorylation (Figure S9).

HCC cells

Icaritin

IL-6-induced
phosphorylation in HCC cells

The involvement of Stat3 signaling pathway in the
maintenance of HCICs has been well documented [11, 35].
Consistence with these findings, we found that the level
of phosphorylation of Stat3 at Y705 was higher in tumor
tissues compared with the paired neighboring tissues
(Figure 3A). Since Icaritin suppressed initiating cells of
HCC, to probe the underlying mechanism, we sought to
examine the effect of Icaritin on the Stat3 pathway.
We found that Icaritin attenuated p-Stat3 (Y705)
phosphorylation while total Stat3 had little change (Figure
3B). Next, we performed a gene knockdown experiment
using the siRNA against Jak2 and found that knockdown
of the Jak2 attenuated the Stat3 phosphorylation,
suggesting Jak2 stimulates Stat3 phosphorylation in
HCC cells (Figure S5). Icaritin potently suppressed
Jak2 phosphorylation in HCC cells. In addition, we
also observed a decrease of the steady state level of
Jak2 protein in Western blot analysis (Figure 3B, 3C).
Furthermore, Icaritin treatment reduced the mRNA
level of the Jak2, suggesting gene expression regulatory
mechanism also was involved in addition to modulation
of kinase activity (Figure S6).
In the cells treated with Icaritin for 2 hours,
phosphorylation of the Stat3 at the residue S727 was
without significant change. However, p-Stat3 (S727) was
significantly reduced when cells were treated with Icaritin
for 24 h (Figure 3C), suggesting that Icaritin may inhibit
Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 and Tyr705 with different
mechanisms. We also found Icaritin inhibited p-ERK1/2 in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Stat3

IL-6 is a potent cytokine that stimulates HCC
progression, primarily through the Stat3 signaling [14,
37]. We observed IL-6 is highly expressed in HCC tumor
tissue compared with normal liver tissue (Figure S10A).
We then examined whether Icaritin is able to block the
IL-6-induced Stat3 phosphorylation in HCC cells. IL-6
induced Stat3 (Y705) phosphorylation (Figure S10B),
which was blocked by Icaritin treatment at higher
concentrations (5, 10, 20 μM) for 2 hours (Figure 4E), or
at lower concentrations (3, 4, 5 μM) for 24 hours in PLC/
PRF/5 and Huh7 cells (Figure 4F). Similar results were
also observed for the phosphorylation of Jak2 (Figure 4E,
4F), indicating Icaritin inhibits the IL-6-induced activation
of the Jak2/Stat3 signaling.

Stat3 plays a critical role in the maintenance of
HCICs
As Icaritin potently inhibited growth of HCICs and
the Jak2/Stat3 signaling, we sought to examine whether
Icaritin-attenuated Jak2/Stat3 signaling is involved in
HCICs inhibition by Icaritin. We treated PLC/PRF/5 and
Huh7 cells with a specific Stat3 activation inhibitor, S3I201. We found that level of Stat3 phosphorylation at the
Tyr705 as well as the expression of its downstream genes,
Mcl-1 and CyclinD1 were down-regulated in the cells
treated with S3I-201 (Figure 4A). S3I-201 also effectively
reduced HCICs and HCC growth (Figure 4B and S11).

Our results indicated that the Jak2/Stat3 pathway plays a

we changed Stat3 activity in HCC cells with the RNAi
or overexpression of constitutive active Stat3. Western
blot analysis showed that transfection of the siRNA
against Stat3 reduced the expression levels of Stat3 and
Stat3-regulated genes (Figure 4C). In addition, Stat3
silencing augmented the inhibitory activity of Icaritin in
hepatosphere formation (Figure 4D). Substitution of two
cysteine residues within the C-terminal loop of the SH2
domain of Stat3 generates a constitutively active Stat3
(Stat3-C) [38]. Forced expression of Stat3-C reduced
Icaritin-inhibitory activity in hepatosphere formation

(Figure 5A, 5B), indicating that Icaritin may block the IL6-mediated signaling pathway through downregulation

blocked by the Stat3 and Jak2 inhibitors, indicating that
Stat3 and IL-6Rs may crossly activated each other (Figure

Icaritin inhibits hepatosphere growth through the
inactivation of IL-6Rs/Jak2/Stat3 signaling

several stemness genes, such as Bmi-1 and Oct4 [22-24].
Icaritin treatment decreased Bmi-1 and Oct4 expression
in a dose-dependent manner in HCC cells (Figure 5C,
5D). In addition, the IL-6-stimulated expression of Bmi-1
and Oct4 was also attenuated by Icaritin (Figure S14). To
determine whether down regulation of the Bmi-1 and Oct4
expression by Icaritin is Stat3 dependent, the constitutively
active mutant Stat3-C was introduced into PLC/PRF/5
cells and the transfected cells were treated with Icaritin.
Icaritin failed to inhibit Bmi-1 and Oct4 expression in the
Stat3-C-transfected cells compared to the vector control
cells (Figure 5E).

HCICs are enriched in hepatosphere formation
medium as non-adherent spherical clusters termed
hepatospheres [11, 13]. Thus, we further studied
Icaritin’s effect on HCICs using the hepatosphere
model. Icaritin treatment reduced both the number
and size of hepatospheres formed by PLC/PRF/5 cells
(Figure 7A, up). Similar results were also observed in
the hepatospheres formed by Huh7 and Hep-12 cells
(Figure7A, low and S17). In addition, Icaritin attenuated
the ability of hepatosphere cells to form secondary passage
of hepatospheres, indicating Icaritin negatively regulates
self-renewal of HCICs (Figure 7B). Furthermore, Icaritintreated hepatospheres lost tumor initiating capability and
the IL-6Rs/Jak2/Stat3 axis of hepatospheres treated with
Icaritin was also suppressed (Figure 7C, 7D).

Icaritin suppresses tumor formation and Stat3
phosphorylation in vivo
To test Icaritin growth inhibitory activity in vivo,
we examined the effects of Icaritin on established HCC
xenografts. Icaritin administration potently inhibited
the growth of the tumor formed by PLC/PRF/5 cells in
NOD/SCID mice (Figure 6A), which was accompanied
by a reduction of p-Stat3 (Y705) level (Figure 6B).
Body weight loss was not observed in Icaritinadministrated groups, indicating Icaritin’s safety (Figure
6C). Additionally, we examined the tumor incidence
of secondary xenografts in NOD/SCID mice that were
inoculated with equal number of cells obtained from
primary vehicle-treated and Icaritin-treated xenografts.
Icaritin-treated group exhibited reduced tumor occurrence
(Figure S15). We also studied Sorafenib’s effect in PLC/
PRF/5 xenografts model. Sorafenib (20mg/kg) has the
comparative effects as Icaritin (70mg/kg) in PLC/PRF/5
xenografts inhibition and down-regulation of p-Stat3
(Y705) (Figure 6D, 6E).

DISCUSSION
Icaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative from
Epimedium Genus, has been used as Chinese traditional
medicine for long time. Previous studies reported that
Icaritin is able to reduce phosphorylation of Stat3 (Y705)
in chronic myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma [32,
41]. However, the effects of Icaritin on HCICs and Stat3’s
role in Icaritin-mediated HCICs inhibition have not been
investigated yet. Furthermore, our study demonstrated
for the first time that Icaritin targeted IL-6Rs, attenuated
both Stat3 (Y705) and Stat3 (S727) and decreased the
expression of IL-6-regulated stemness genes. It was
reported that Icaritin activated AHR in prostate cancer
[42]. Another study reported that IL-6, Stat3 and AHR may
form an autocrine loop [43]. Whether AHR’s activation by
Icaritin mediates IL-6/Stat3 signal inhibition will need to
be investigated in future.
TICs drive tumor growth and recurrence. These cells
exhibit certain features in vitro, including expression of
stem cell markers, tumorsphere formation in suspension
cultures, and resistance to chemo-and radio-treatments
[5]. TICs are also responsible for tumor initiation,
progression, metastasis and recurrence in vivo [13]. Our
previous study showed that Icaritin potently inhibits
growth of ALDH1-positive breast tumor initiating cells
[28]. Here, we showed that Icaritin abolished primary and
secondary hepatosphere formation of HCICs, reduced the
populations of cells positive for HCC-stem cell markers
such as EpCAM, inhibited primary and secondary
xenografts in NOD/SCID mice, suppressed malignant
growth of the primary HCC cells, Hep-12 in vitro and in
vivo. These results provide the evidence to support the
view that Icaritin can be developed into a potent agent to
treat HCC by targeting HCICs.
IL-6 is a cofactor important in the amplification

Icaritin exhibits inhibitory activity in patient
derived HCC cells
We then examined Icaritin’s effect on growth
of patient derived HCC cells. Hep-12 cells (a kind gift
from Professor Baocai Xing of Cancer hospital, Peking
University) were primarily cultured from a recurrent HCC
patient and enriched for HCICs [40]. We found that Icaritin
treatment inhibited the growth of Hep-12 cells in a dosedependent manner in vitro (Figure 6F). Icaritin reduced
the EpCAM positive population and the phosphorylation
level of Jak2 and Stat3 in Hep-12 cells (Figure 6G, 6H).
In vivo, Icaritin also reduced growth of Hep-12 xenografts
in NOD/SCID mice (Figure 6I), which was accompanied
by a down-regulation of p-Stat3 (Y705) (Figure 6J). In
addition, Icaritin showed potent inhibition activity in the
other two patient derived cells (Figure S16A). Icaritin
reduced EpCAM+ population in the xenografts derived
from one patient (Figure S16B).

in HCC. IL-6 in HCC microenvironment binds to cell surface IL-6 receptors (gp80 and gp130) and activates Jak2. Icaritin blocks Jak2
phosphorylation, which mediates Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling. IL-6Rs receptors downregulated by Icaritin
intensifies the attenuation of p-Stat3 (Y705). In addition, Icaritin may also suppress the MAPK/ERK signaling, that phosphorylates p-Stat3
(S727). ICT, Icaritin; CIS, Cisplatin.

and differentiation of stem cells [35, 44]. HCC expresses
two types of IL-6 receptors, gp80 and gp130 [39]. IL-6
binds to gp80 first and then recruits gp130 to signal
downstream cascades. After gp130 dimerization, Jak2
becomes activated and leads to tyrosine phosphorylation
of cytoplastic transcription factors such as Stats [39].
The major Stat transcription factor activated by the IL-6
signaling is Stat3. After activation, Stat3 translocates from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces downstream
genes. The aberrant IL-6 signaling dysregulates progenitor/
stem cells, which eventually results in HCC carcinogenesis
[37]. It was reported that the activated IL-6/Stat3 signaling
leads upregulation of stemness genes, including Bmi-1 and
Oct4, which preserve stemness of HCC cells [20-24]. In
this study, using the Stat3 specific inhibitor S3I-201 or
Stat3’s siRNA method, we found Stat3 function is critical
in tumor initiation of HCC. The HCICs inhibitory effect
of Icaritin was through inactivation the Stat3 function as
evidenced by the Stat3 knock-down and overexpression
experiments. Our results that Icaritin blocked IL-6-induced
expression of the stemness genes, Bmi-1 and Oct4 further
indicated that Icaritin inhibited the IL-6/Stat3 signaling
and downstream genes.
The importance of the IL-6/Stat3 signaling in
cancer and cancer stem cells has been well documented.
The IL-6/Stat3 signaling promotes HCC progression
through inhibiting apoptosis by inducing the expression
of anti-apoptotic factors of Bcl-2 family such as Mcl-1
and Bcl-xl [45]. In HCICs, Stat3 acts as a self-renewal
factor in maintenance of HCICs through induction of the
Oct4/Nanog stemness genes [11, 22]. Hyperactivation
of the IL-6 signaling induces non-TICs convert to TICs
[46]. HCICs, but not bulk HCC cells acquire the autocrine
IL-6/Stat3 signaling that stimulates their malignance
progression and induces HCC initiation in vivo [35].
Sorafenib that targets multiple kinases was approved
by FDA for the advanced HCC therapy several years ago.
However, the overall survival was 6.5 months in Sorafenib
group and 4.2 months in the placebo group in the Asia
trial [47]. Thus, less toxic and more effective agents are
urgently needed for the treatment of advanced HCC.
Targeted therapy with the inhibitors on several pathways,
such as VEGFR, EGFR, mTOR and c-MET is in
development now [48]. The combination therapy of these
agents, will be a strategy for HCC treatment in future.
In this study, we discovered that Icaritin potently
inhibited growth of HCC cells but has little toxicity in
normal hepatocyte cells compared to Cisplatin. Icaritin
(17.5mg/kg and 70mg/kg) exhibits low toxicity since
animal weights were without change during the whole
experiments, consistent with a previous study that Icaritin
has a favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles
[42]. Furthermore, our clinical studies [NCT01278810,
NCT01972672] showed Icaritin exhibits high level of
safety even after orally received 1600 mg per day. These
results indicate Icaritin is a less toxic and high effective
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

agent for HCC therapy.
Currently, a clinical phase I study with Icaritin
has been completed [33]. Among thirteen HCC patients
who were treated with Icaritin and evaluated, one patient
obtained partial response (PR) and progressed after oneyear treatment, and four patients had stable disease (SD)
for more than 4 months [33]. Now, the phase II clinical
study of Icaritin in HCC [NCT01972672] is currently
underway. Since the therapeutic strategies for HCC
are limited, our study provides a strong rational for
development of Icaritin as a novel therapeutic agent for
effective and safe treatment of HCC by targeting HCICs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissue specimens
A total of twenty-one pairs of patient samples were
used in the study. All patients received curative resection
for liver cancer at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy
of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College
(Beijing, China) between March 2014 and August 2014.
The patients did not receive any preoperative cancer
treatments. The clinicopathological characteristics of the
patients are presented in Table S1. Clinical samples from
patients were collected for immunochemistry staining after
obtaining informed consent in accordance with a protocol
approved by the Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital,
Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union
Medical College (Beijing, China).

Animal models
All experimental procedures were approved by The
Animal Care and Use Committee of Cancer Hospital,
Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union
Medical College (Beijing, China). Female, 4-6 weeks old
NOD/SCID mice were used (Vitalriver, Beijing, China) in
animal experiments.
To perform the tumor seeding ability assay, the
survived cells from HCC cells treated with DMSO,
Icaritin (10μM), and Cisplatin (10 μg/mL) for 48 h or
hepatospheres treated with DMSO and Icaritin (10μM)
for five days were selected with flow cytometry after
7-AAD staining. Serial transplant tumorigenesis assay
was performed by subcutaneously injected with 5×105 or
5×104 selected cells into each of NOD/SCID mice. Tumor
incidence and tumor growth curves were examined after
30 days of implantation.
For in vivo assay, NOD/SCID mice were implanted
subcutaneously with 1×106 PLC/PRF/5 or Hep-12 cells.
For the PDX model, xenografts maintained in nude mice
within 10 passages were implanted subcutaneously.
After tumors reached about 100 mm3, the indicated
31938

Oncotarget

concentrations of Icaritin or vehicle control (corn oil) were
administered by gastric gavage daily. Cisplatin (2 mg/kg)
was administered intravenously twice per week. Sorafenib
(20mg/kg) was administrated intravenously daily. Tumor
growth was monitored twice per week with digital caliper
measurements and tumor volume was calculated as
L×W2/2.
For the secondary xenograft, PLC/PRF/5 primary
xenografts treated with the vehicle control or Icaritin
(70mg/kg) were collected and minced into 1 mm3
cubes and incubated with Type IV Collagenase (Sigma
Aldirich) for 30 min at 37°C. A single-cell suspension
was obtained by filtering through a 100 μM cell strainer
(BD Biosciences).1×104 living cells sorted with FACS
from each xenograft were injected subcutaneously for
secondary xenografts formation in the absence of Icaritin.
Tumor occurrence was evaluated as relapse percentage.

Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell viability assay
Cells at the logarithmic phase were collected and
4000 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates
and cultured for 24 h in the conditional medium described
above. The indicated concentrations of drugs were added
for 24 or 48 h. Finally, cell viability was measured using
the CCK-8 assay according to the manufacture instructions
(Dojindo). The percentage of viable cells was calculated
using the following formula: cell viability (%) = (OD of
treated cells/OD of control cells) ×100.
For the viability assay with Patient derived cells
(Bioduro, China), cells were acquired by primary culture
and expanded with DMEM medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum for less than ten passages, then finally used
for cell viability assay as mentioned above.

Cell lines and cell culture

Cell apoptosis assay

The human HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and Huh-7
were originally obtained from Japanese Cancer Research
Bank, Tokyo, Japan and human hepatic cell line L02
was from Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Hep-12 cells were a kind
gift from Dr. Baocai Xing at Cancer hospital, Peking
University and were used within 10 passages [40]. Cells
were cultured in complete high glucose DMEM medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum, 100 mg/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/
ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. HCC cells used in this study produce
IL-6 (Figure S18).
For the drugs or chemicals-treatment, 24 h before
the experiments, cells were seeded into the conditional
medium (2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS, phenol-red free
Gibco DMEM medium including 100 mg/ml penicillin G,
and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were then treated with
the indicated concentrations of drugs or chemicals for the
indicated time and the final DMSO concentration in the
incubation system was no more than 0.1%.

The cells (2×105/well) in six-well plates were
treated with the indicated concentrations of agents for
12 h, and then were collected and washed twice in icecold PBS. Cell apoptosis assay was conducted using an
Annexin V-FITC kit (BD pharmingen) according to the
manufacture’s instruction and BD Accuri™ C6 flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, CA, U.S.). The results were
analyzed with CFlow Plus software (Becton-Dickinson,
CA, U.S.).

EpCAM flow cytometric analysis
The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated EpCAM
(eBioscience),
PE-conjugated
isotype
control
(eBioscience) and 7-AAD (BD pharmingen) were used
for EpCAM flow cytometric assay. Cells treated with
the indicated concentrations of agents or DMSO control
were collected and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing antibodies of EpCAM, isotype, or
7-AAD for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed twice with
cold PBS. The results were examined with BD Accuri™
C6 flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, CA, U.S.) and
analyzed with CFlow Plus software (Becton-Dickinson,
CA, U.S.).

Plasmids, siRNAs and reagents
The siRNAs for Stat3, Jak2 (pools of three specific
19-25 nt siRNAs) and control siRNA were purchased
from Santa Cruz. The Constitutive active Stat3-C plasmid
was a kind gift from Professor Zhijie Chang (Tsinghua
University) [49]. Icaritin was purified from Epimedium
at the Beijing Shenogen pharma group with over 99 %
purity. Cisplatin and AG490 were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich. Sorafenib was purchased from Selleck. U0126
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and
Hoechst was from BD Pharmingen. Human recombinant
IL-6 was from Peprotech and S3I-201 was purchased from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Hepatosphere formation assay
A total of 1000 single HCC cells were plated in Ultra
Low Attachment 24-well plates (Corning). Cells were
grown in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 4 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/
ml EGF and 20 ng/ml basic FGF (Peprotech) for five
days. To obtain secondary passage of primary spheres, the
31939

μM, and de-waxed. Antigen retrieval by heating the slides
in the rice cooker for three minutes using citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) was followed by treatment with 3% H2O2 for 10
minutes. The slides were then incubated with 1% BSA/
PBS for 1 h at room temperature to reduce nonspecific
background staining. The slides were incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, then rinsed and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Ventana). The slides
were rinsed with PBS, incubated for 90 seconds with
diaminobenzidine k8000 kit (DAKO), counterstained
with hematoxylin (DAKO) and mounted in dimethyl
benzene. For the p-Stat3 (Y705) scoring, cells in five fields
were randomly selected and scored by two pathologists.
Depending on the intensity of staining, the staining was
classified into 4 groups: (no staining=0; weak staining =
1; moderate staining = 2; and strong staining = 3). The
staining was also classified into 5 groups according the
percentage of stained cells (0% = 0; 1%-25% = 1; 26%50% = 2; 51%-75% =3; and 76%-100% = 4). Final
immunoreactive scores were determined by the formula:
overall scores = intensity score × percentage score. The
overall score ≤ 3 was defined as negative, >3 as positive.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription reactions were
performed using the AMV First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (NEB, USA). Real-time PCR assays were performed
using an Applied Biosystems 7300 Detection System
(Applied Biosystems®, CA). The real-time PCR reaction
was performed according to the protocol of the Power
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
CA). The amplification procedure: 95°C for 15 seconds,
and 60°C for 60 seconds for 40 cycles. Data was analyzed
using the Sequence Detection Software, Version 1.2.3
(Applied Biosystems). The amount of target cDNA was
calculated and normalized with the GAPDH levels in the
samples. The primers utilized for real-time PCR analysis
were listed in Table S2.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay for
IL-6

Western blots assay

IL-6 levels were measured using the supernatants
from HCC cell condition medium or fresh medium
as a control. The experiments were performed with a
commercially available human IL-6 High Sensitivity
ELISA kit (sensitivity 0.03 pg/ml) according to the
manufacture’s instruction.

Total protein was collected from the cells after
various treatments. For Western blots, a previously
described procedure was applied [28].The following
primary antibodies were used: p-Jak2 (Y1007/1008),
total Jak2, p-Stat3 (Y705), p-Stat3 (S727), and total
Stat3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antibodies for gp130, gp80, Bmi-1, Oct4 and GAPDH
were from Santa Cruz. Mcl-1 and CyclinD1 antibodies
were obtained from Abcam. The secondary anti-mouse
and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz. All the experiments were performed at least twice
and quantification data with statistical analysis was
summarized in Figure S19.

Statistic analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the
program developed by the Prism GraphPad software, Inc.
(La Jolla, CA, USA). The values are represented as mean
± SD or SEM as indicated. The difference between groups
was analyzed using the Student’s t-test when comparing
only two groups or by a one-way ANOVA analysis when
comparing more than two groups. P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Plasmids and siRNAs transfection
The cells (2×105/well) in a six-well plate were
transfected with the indicated plasmids (2.5 μg/ml) or
siRNAs (0.45 μg/ml) by Lipofectamine 3000™ following
the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). After 48 h,
cells were harvested for the western blots, cell viability
assay or hepatosphere formation assay as described above.
