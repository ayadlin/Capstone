ABSTRACT
Metformin, which is a drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, has shown
anti-tumor effects in numerous experimental, epidemiologic, observational, and
clinical studies. Here, we report a new metformin derivative, metformin-butyrate
(MFB). Compared to metformin-HCl, it more potently activates AMPK, inhibits mTOR,
and impairs cell cycle progression at S and G2/M phases. Moreover, MFB inhibits
the mammosphere formation of breast cancer cells and shows cytotoxic effects
against CD44+CD24-/low populations in vitro and in vivo, indicating that it might have
preferential effects on the cancer stem cell population. MFB showed synergistic
cytotoxicity with docetaxel and cisplatin, and MFB pretreatment of breast cancer cells
prior to their injection into the mammary fat pads of mice significantly decreased the
obtained xenograft tumor volumes, compared with untreated or metformin-pretreated
cells. Overall, MFB showed greater anti-neoplastic activity and greater efficacies
in targeting the G2/M phase and breast cancer stem cell population, compared to
metformin-HCl. This suggests that MFB may be a promising therapeutic agent against
aggressive and resistant breast cancers.

with cancer. Mechanistically, metformin has been shown
to affect AMPK and mTOR signaling activity [9-13] and
modulate cell cycle-related molecules to cause G1 arrest
and apoptosis [14-16].
The abilities of anti-cancer drugs to cause cell
growth arrest and/or apoptosis are often conferred via
modulation of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
and/or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), leading
to G1 or G2/M arrest [17, 18]. G1-phase cyclin D and
CDK4/6 can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein
(pRB) to release E2F, triggering transcriptional activation
of the cyclin E promoter as the cell passes through the
restriction point prior to S phase [18]. The active cyclin
E-CDK2 complex then further phosphorylates pRB to
enhance the E2F-dependent transcriptional activation of
cyclin A promoter regions, thereby enabling efficient S
phase progression [18, 19].

INTRODUCTION
Metformin (1, 1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride),
which is the most widely used anti-diabetic drug for type
2 diabetes, has recently been shown to possess strong
anti-cancer effects [1]. Recent epidemiologic studies
have indicated that the use of metformin in type II
diabetic patients significantly suppresses the development
of cancers and lowered cancer-related mortality [13]. Furthermore, a retrospective study found that the
addition of metformin to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
yielded a significantly higher rate of pathologic complete
response (pCR) in diabetic patients with breast cancer [4].
Preclinical studies in animal model systems have shown
that metformin decreases the tumor growth of breast
[5, 6], colon [7], and pancreatic [8] cancers. Therefore,
metformin appears to be an effective means of dealing

The cancer stem cell hypothesis postulates that
tumors are maintained by self-renewing cancer stem cells
(CSCs; also called tumor-initiating cells) that are also
capable of differentiating into non-self-renewing cell
populations for the bulk tumor mass [20, 21]. CSCs have
the stem cell characteristics of self-renewal or tumorinitiation, and may play critical roles in tumorigenic
growth, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance [22-25]. To
improve the efficacy of cancer therapy, it could be useful
to develop novel therapeutic reagents that can eliminate
or target CSCs [23, 25]. Although recent studies have
implicated metformin as a therapeutic agent capable of
targeting CSCs [5, 26-30], the mechanism(s) underlying the
inhibitory effects of metformin on CSCs are not completely
understood. Moreover, a major potential limitation in using
metformin as an anti-cancer reagent is the high effective
concentration of metformin during determination of
metformin concentration that can be safely treated during
in vitro analyses and in the (pre)clinical purposes [13, 31].
To address these issues, we hypothesized that it could be
possible to develop a structural analog of metformin that
could have an even more potent anti-cancer activity and
target specificity than metformin.
In our efforts to develop novel metformin derivatives
with increased potency for AMPK activation and mTOR
inhibition, we found that the anti-cancer effects of
metformin-butyrate (MFB) appeared to outperform those of

metformin at lower doses. Compared to metformin, MFB
had much lower (2 ~ 30-fold) IC50 values for triggering G1
and G2/M arrest, impairing S phase entry and/or progression,
and inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Further, MFB
showed more potent targeting of the CD44+/high/CD24-/low
CSC-like population compared to metformin. These results
suggest that MFB could be a promising anti-cancer reagent
that is capable of targeting S phase events with greater
specificity compared to metformin.

RESULTS
A novel metformin derivative (MFB) shows more
potent anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer
cells than metformin
To identify the metformin derivatives with the
highest cytotoxicity against cancer cells, we screened a
series of metformin analogs for their ability to decrease
viability in breast cancer cell lines (data not shown).
Nineteen breast cancer cell lines, including the luminal and
basal A and B subtypes (also termed triple-negative breast
cancer, TNBC), were treated with 0.01 to 100 mM of each
metformin analog for 48 h, and cytotoxicity was compared
to that conferred by metformin (positive control). Among
the tested metformin derivatives, MFB was selected as the
most effective anti-cancer compound (Figure 1A). In the

indeed, treatment with 10 mM MFB rendered cyclin
A almost completely undetectable (Figure 2D). This
observation suggests that MFB impairs S phase entry
and/or progression more effectively than metformin.
Next, we used flow cytometry to analyze the proportions
of cells in each of the cell cycle phases following
treatment with or without metformin or MFB. Compared
to the vehicle controls, BT20 and Hs578T cells treated
with MFB (10 mM) for 24 h showed almost no S phase
cells and a significant proportion of cells were arrested
in G2/M phase, whereas those treated with metformin
were mostly arrested in G1 phase (Figure 2E and 2F).
These findings indicate that MFB appears to target S
phase entry and/or progression through G2/M phase
more specifically than does metformin.
To examine whether MFB could induce apoptosis
more effectively than metformin, we performed flow
cytometric analysis of Annexin V-stained TNBC cell lines
treated with or without metformin or MFB. Our results
revealed that, compared to metformin, MFB triggered
a greater degree of apoptosis in the tested cell lines
(Figure 3A). Following treatment with 10 mM MFB, the
apoptotic populations increased as follows: BT20 cells,
from 7.6% (before treatment) to 48% (after treatment);
MDA-MB-231 cells, 11% to 56.4%; and Hs578T cells,
9.2% to 71% (Figure 3A). As an additional indication of
apoptosis, we measured caspase-3/7 activity in MDAMB-231 cells. Interestingly, MFB-treated cells showed
up to 3-fold increases in caspase-3/7 activity, whereas
the metformin-treated cells did not (Figure 3B). These
results were further confirmed by an increase in the
cleaved (active) form of caspase-3 (data not shown). MFB
treatment also increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
1 (PARP1) cleavage to a greater degree than metformin
treatment (Figure 3C). These results suggest that MFB
treatment more induces caspase- and/or PARP-mediated
apoptosis in breast cancer cells than metformin. We
next tested the effect of co-treating cells with MFB plus
cisplatin or docetaxel, which are the most widely used
chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer. Co-treatment
of BT20 (docetaxel-resistant) or MDA-MB-231 (cisplatinresistant) cells with 5 mM MFB plus 50 nM docetaxel or
cisplatin yielded significantly greater cytotoxic effects
compared to the co-treatment of cells with metformin plus
either chemotherapeutic agent (Figure 3D). This suggests
that drug resistance could be overcome by co-treatment
with MFB.

metformin-resistant (defined as an IC50 value of > 50 mM)
BT474 luminal A breast cancer cell line, MFB exerted
approximately 10-fold more potent cytotoxic effects than
metformin (IC50, 9.1 mM versus > 100 mM, respectively;
Figure 1B). MFB also exerted more potent cytotoxic
effects against MDA-MB-453 Her2-positive breast cancer
cells (IC50, 3.4 mM) and MDA-MB-231 TNBC (IC50, 9.2
mM) compared to metformin (IC50, 51.3 mM and 51.4
mM, respectively) (Table 1 and Figure 1C).
No significant difference in cytotoxicity was
observed in metformin-sensitive cell lines (e.g.,
MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-436 cells) treated with
metformin versus MFB, but MFB generally exhibited 2to 30-fold greater cytotoxicity against most of the tested
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 1B and 1C). Our results
suggest that MFB can inhibit cancer cell proliferation,
and that these effects are more potent than those of
metformin. Notably, metformin was preferentially
cytotoxic to TNBC cells, showing mean IC50 values of
31.2 mM for non-TNBC (luminal subtype) cells and 17.2
mM for TNBC cells. In contrast, the mean IC50 values
of MFB did not differ between these groups (4.3 and
4.1 mM, respectively) (Figure 1C). This suggests that,
compared to metformin, MFB exerts stronger cytotoxic
activities against breast cancer cells, regardless of the
subtype.

MFB treatment of breast cancer cells causes
aberrant S phase progression and/or apoptosis
Since metformin is known to affect AMPK/mTOR
signaling activity [32], we compared the effects of MFB
and metformin in this regard. Various breast cancer cell
lines (luminal type, MCF7 and BT474; TNBC type, BT20,
MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and NDY-1) were treated with
metformin or MFB (10 mM) for 12 h, and cell lysates were
analyzed for their levels of p-AMPK (T172) and p-mTOR
(S2448). Our results revealed that MFB activated AMPK
and inhibited mTOR with significantly greater potencies
than metformin in all of the tested breast cancer cell lines
(Figure 2A). This suggests that MFB could potentiate the
pharmacological activities of metformin.
To test whether these two drugs have different
effects on cell cycle progression, we used an antibody
array to analyze cell cycle-related molecules (Figure
2B) in extracts from metformin- or MFB-treated MDAMB-231 cells. Our results revealed that MFB treatment
decreased cyclin A, E and cdc2 (which are related to
S phase entry and progression) and increased Wee2
(a negative regulator of CDK2/cyclin B complex
during the G2 to M phase transition) significantly
more than did metformin treatment (Figure 2B and
2C). Immunoblotting showed that while treatment
with metformin at concentrations up to 40 mM did not
change the levels of cyclins D, E or A, treatment with
20 mM MFB diminished the levels of these cyclins;

MFB significantly decreases the CD44+CD24-/low
population and mammosphere formation of

Next, we explored whether MFB treatment
significantly inhibited the population of breast cancer
cells that were CD44+CD24-/low, which is a feature of breast
CSCs [33]. Using flow cytometric analysis, we assessed

the distribution of these cell-surface stem cell markers in
TNBC cells following treatment (48 h) with 10 mM MFB
or metformin. The percentage of BT20 cells exhibiting
the putative stem-like CD44+CD24-/low immunophenotype
decreased from 31 ± 3% (in untreated control cells) to 0.8
± 0.2% and 17.9 ± 4% following exposure to 10 mM MFB
and metformin, respectively (Figure 4A, top panel). MFB
treatment also significantly reduced the CD44+CD24-/
low
cell populations in MDA-MB-468 cells (from 2.2%
to 0.7%), Hs578T (from 91.7% to 71.0%), and MDAMB-231 cells (97.0% to 74.8%) (Figure 4A and 4B).
To examine whether MFB could inhibit the
properties characteristic of breast CSCs or circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) more effectively than metformin, we
evaluated the number of spheres generated in the absence
or presence of metformin or MFB (10 mM) for 48 h. In
BT20 and MDA-MB-468 cells, MFB treatment blocked
sphere formation and significantly reduced the mean
number and size of the formed spheres (Figure 4C and
4D). Remarkably, the effects of MFB on sphere formation
were observed at a lower concentration (50 μM, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

slightly reduced cell viability) than that required to obtain
the same results from metformin treatment (data not
shown), these results show that MFB inhibits the breast
CSC population.

MFB more effectively inhibits the CD44+
CD24-/low cells (putative CSCs) in heterogeneous
breast cancer cell populations
To examine whether the effect of MFB on breast
cancer cells might be inhibited by the expression levels of
stemness-related molecules, we used immunofluorescence
staining and FACS to isolate CSCs (CD44+CD24-/low) and
their counterpart non-stem cancer cells (NSCs; CD44-/
low
CD24+) from BT20 and HCC1937 TNBC cells. We
confirmed the expression of CD24 (green fluorescence)
in both cell lines (Figure 5A) and further validated that
the size and number of formed spheres was higher in the
CSC populations of both cell lines, compared with their
NSC counterparts (Figure 5B). The sorted cells were
then exposed to metformin or MFB (0.01-100 mM for

48 h), cell viability was measured, and IC50 values were
calculated. In BT20 TNBC cells, the cytotoxic effect
of MFB was dramatically higher in CD44+CD24-/low
breast CSCs (IC50, 4.2. mM) compared to CD44-CD24+/
low
breast NSCs (IC50, 7.8 mM), whereas the IC50 value
for metformin was somewhat higher in BT20-derived
CSCs than in BT20-NSCs (Figure 5C, left). Conversely,
in HCC1937 TNBC cells, the IC50 value for metformin
was significantly lower in CSCs (14.8 mM) than NSCs
(32.0 mM), whereas the values for MFB were similar in
CSCs and NSCs (IC50 < 3.0 mM). This suggests that MFB
inhibited breast CSCs more effectively than breast NSCs.
To begin examining the potential clinical relevance
of MFB treatment, we treated cells derived from two breast
cancer patients with metformin or MFB (10 mM), and
examined sphere formation. We found that MFB treatment
decreased sphere formation to a significantly higher
degree than metformin (Figure 5D and 5E). Together, our
results suggest that MFB could hold therapeutic promise
for targeting breast CSC populations.

We investigated the ability of MFB to inhibit in vivo
tumor growth, using xenograft mouse models in which
MDA-MB-231 and NDY-1 cells were injected into the
mammary fat pads of immunocompromised NOD/scid
IL2Rg (null) (NOG) mice. Tumor-bearing mice were
intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with MFB or metformin
(250 mg/kg) once a day for 21 days. We found significant
decreases in the tumor growth, tumor volume (by ~ 40%),
and tumor growth rate (which slowed time-dependently)
in mice treated with MFB compared to those observed in
mice treated with vehicle or metformin (which did not
significantly differ in any parameter) (Figure 6A and 6B).
These results demonstrate that MFB inhibits breast cancer
cell growth more effectively than metformin in vivo,
suggesting that it could be a promising therapeutic drug
against TNBC.

Next, to compare the anti-tumor effects of metformin
and MFB in vivo, MDA-MB-231 cells (1 X 104) were
pretreated in vitro with metformin or MFB for 16 h, and
then injected orthotopically into immunocompromised
mice. The mice were then evaluated for tumor initiation
and growth. Although all mice showed initiation of solid
tumor formation around the same time, those injected with
MFB-pretreated cells formed tumors that were slightly
smaller in tumor volume and weighed significantly less
compared to tumors derived from control or metformintreated cells (Figure 6C). Finally, we analyzed the CD44+
and CD24-/low populations in mouse-cell-depleted cancer
cells isolated from obtained from vehicle-, metformin- or
MFB (250 mg/kg)-treated xenograft tumors. Significantly
fewer CD44+CD24-/low breast CSCs were found in MFBtreated NDY-1 xenograft tumors (Figure 6B) compared to
vehicle- or metformin-treated xenograft tumors (Figure
6D). To identify the potential underlying mechanisms
for this effect, we subjected xenograft tumor tissues to
Western blot analyses against p-AMPK, p-mTOR and
mesenchymal phenotype-associated proteins (i.e., slug,
vimentin, N-cadherin, and ZEB1). The level of p-AMPK

(and thus the activity of AMPK) was higher, while the
levels of p-mTOR and the tested mesenchymal markers
were lower in MFB-treated cell-derived xenograft tumors
compared to vehicle- or metformin-treated cell-derived
xenograft tumors (Figure 6E). Given that mesenchymal
markers might directly drive the emergence of breast
CSC phenotypes, we confirmed that the ability of MFB
to significantly repress the expression of mesenchymal
markers, such as slug, vimentin, N-cadherin, and ZEB1,
the decreased mesenchymal markers levels in MFBpretreated cell-derived xenograft tumors could be expected
(Figure 6E).
Collectively, our results indicate that, compared to
metformin, MFB yields improved anti-neoplastic activity by
more specifically and effectively targeting breast CSCs and
impairing their entry into (or progression through) S phase.

DISCUSSION
This study reveals that metformin-butyrate
(MFB), a derivative of metformin, could be a promising

therapeutic agent against breast cancer. Our in vitro and
in vivo experiments show that, compared to metformin,
MFB appears to more effectively impair S phase entry
and/or progression through G2/M phase and decrease
mammosphere formation, especially in the CD44+CD24-/low
population that resembles breast CSCs. Emerging
evidence from epidemiologic and preclinical studies
suggests that metformin exerts anticancer activity [1-4,
34], but the clinical translation of this finding has been
limited by the high concentrations of metformin required
to obtain anticancer activity [13, 31, 34]. It is uncertain
that whether this high concentration of metformin can
be achieved without adverse effect in humans. Thus,
structural analogs of metformin should be designed,
synthesized and tested for their ability to deliver better
anticancer activity and target specificity than metformin.
Here, we report the development of a novel metformin
analog with superior anti-neoplastic effects. We screened
breast cancer cell lines for decreased cell viability in
the presence of various analogs of metformin in vitro,
and found that, compared to metformin, MFB exerted
a stronger dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect on

various breast cancer cell lines. Metformin is known to
inactivate mTOR via activation of AMPK, thereby directly
inhibiting cell growth and tumorigenesis [9, 31]. Although
the precise underlying mechanism(s) have not yet been
fully elucidated, increasing evidence indicates that the
P13K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in the
survival and proliferation of cancer cells [9, 11, 15, 32,
35]. Therefore, it is clinically important that, compared
to metformin, MFB markedly activated AMPK and
inactivated mTOR with greater potency in all tested breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
Metformin has been shown to block the cell cycle at
G0/G1 phase without inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells [36], whereas it reportedly stimulates apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells [37]. This apparent discrepancy
may reflect variations in the utilized experimental
conditions and/or it could indicate that metformin has
cell-type-specific functions. Some studies have suggested
that the responsiveness of a cell to metformin is related
to its p53 status [38]. In the present study, however,
the p53 status did not appear to affect the sensitivity of
breast cancer cells to MFB-induced apoptosis. Whereas

metformin caused G1 arrest and apoptosis (at higher doses)
without altering the S phase population, MFB not only
triggered G1 arrest by decreasing cyclin D expression,
it also specifically inhibited S phase entry/progression,
presumably via decreased expression of cyclin E, cdc2
and A. Moreover, it triggered G2/M arrest, perhaps by
enhancing the expression of Wee2 (Wee1B), which is
responsible for the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1
(Tyr15) and subsequent inactivation of the CDK1/cyclin
B complex [39]. Therefore, there are critical differences
in the cytotoxic effects of MFB and metformin. MFB
was associated with enhanced G2/M arrest without any
residual S phase population, whereas metformin enhanced
S phase but did not appreciably enhance the G2/M phase
population.
Due to the success of endocrine therapy, the
mortality of breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor

(ER)-positive tumors has significantly decreased in
recent years. In contrast, triple-negative breast cancers
(TNBCs, which lack clinical expression of estrogen and
progesterone receptors while showing overexpression
of the HER-2 receptor) cannot be treated with current
endocrine or HER2-targeting therapies. They also tend
to relapse early and metastasize, leading to poor patient
survival [40-43]. Therefore, it is urgent that we develop
new therapeutic reagents for TNBC patients. Some in
vitro studies have demonstrated that the antitumor effect
of metformin is most prominent for TNBC, but that this
effect requires a very high dose of the drug [15, 44, 45].
Consistent with these previous reports, we observed that
metformin was preferentially cytotoxic to TNBC cell lines
(mean IC50 values of 31.2 and 17.2 mM in non-TNBC
and TNBC, respectively). In contrast, MFB was not only
more effective against breast cancer than metformin, it

Figure 5: Compared to metformin, MFB more potently targets CD44+CD24-/low breast cells (putative CSCs) in
heterogeneous breast cancer cell populations. A. Both breast CSCs (CD44+CD24-/low) and their counterpart non-stem cancer cells

(NSCs) were isolated from subconfluent BT20 (top) and HCC1937 (bottom) cells by FACS, and immunofluorescence was used to assess
the expression of CD24 (green fluorescence). B. Mammosphere formation of BT20 was analyzed, and the mammosphere formation efficacy
(MSFE) was calculated in terms of sphere size and number after 3 days, using FACS. Q1 depicts the quadrant containing the CD44-/lowCD24+
cells, while Q4 contained the CD44+CD24-/low cells. C. Cell viability was measured in sorted cell populations exposed to metformin (10
mM) or MFB (0.01-100 mM, 48 h), and IC50 values were calculated for NSCs and CSCs. D and E. Mammosphere-like structures derived
from cells obtained from two breast cancer patients (Pt 01, Pt 02) were analyzed in sphere medium for 5 days in the absence or presence of
10 mM metformin or MFB (100 x magnification) (D). The numbers of spheres (> 50 μm) are summarized in (E). Symbols: *, p < 0.05; #, p

was equally effective against non-TNBC and TNBC cells
(mean IC50, 4.3 and 4.1 mM, respectively). Furthermore,
MFB was more effectively therapeutic in combination
with docetaxel or cisplatin, and MFB, but not metformin,
effectively targeted the CD44+/highCD24-/low population
sorted from tumor cells prepared from mouse xenografts.
The no response of the cells to metformin might be
possible adaptation or trans-differentiation of tumor
cells to be less sensitive to metformin without losing the
sensitivity to MFB.
TNBC is characterized by a larger subpopulation
of stem-like cells compared to other molecular subtypes
[46, 47]. The existence of these breast CSCs may explain
the failure of high-dose chemotherapy in patients with
distant metastases or locally advanced tumors. Therefore,
effective therapy of TNBC could benefit from strategies
aimed at eliminating CSCs. Interestingly, metformin was
preferentially cytotoxic to CSCs or stem cell-like cells

relative to non-CSCs. Hirsch et al. recently demonstrated
that sphere forming, self-renewing breast CSCs appear
to exhibit sensitivity to metformin [5], while Alejandro
et al. reported that CSCs can promote mammosphere
formation [26]. In the present work, we found that MFB
(even at relatively low concentrations compared to the
dosage of metformin) dramatically suppressed the sizes
and numbers of mammospheres formed by cell lines
and primary epithelial cells. Our in vitro and in vivo
studies also showed that, compared to metformin, MFB
more effectively targeted the population of cells with
the CD44+CD24-/low surface marker distribution, which
is consistent with breast CSCs [33]. Therefore, this
study reveals that the cytotoxicity of MFB against breast
cancer cells has unique features compared to the response
triggered by its parent compound, metformin-HCl.
Future work is needed to better understand the molecular
mechanism(s) through which MFB promotes the death of

injections of metformin or MFB (250 mg/kg body weigh) for 3 weeks. Treatment with vehicle, metformin, or MFB was started when the
average tumor volume was 50 mm3. Tumor volume was measured at the indicated time points. Data are representative of three independent
cohorts of mice. C. MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with vehicle, metformin, or MFB (10 mM) for 16 h, and then injected into
the orthotopic mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD/SCID IL2Rg (null) (NOG) mice (1 X 104 cells/mouse). Gross
morphological examination of representative xenograft tumor tissues excised from each group at 2 months post-injection (n = 8 per group,

cancer (stem) cells. However, it is clinically interesting
to note that MFB could block S phase entry/progression
following G1 arrest, cause significant G2/M phase arrest,
and target the CD44+/highCD24-/low population that may be
representative of CSCs.
In sum, we herein show that the metformin
derivative, MFB, blocks breast cancer cell growth and
cell cycle progression via G1 and G2/M arrests, whereas
metformin causes only G1 arrest. In addition, MFB blocks
growth and decreases survival in the CD44+CD24-/low
cell population more effectively than metformin in vitro
and in vivo. These findings suggest that MFB could be a
promising new agent for treating breast cancer.

factor (bFGF; Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), 10 ng/
mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Millipore), B27
supplement (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-antimycotic
(Invitrogen). Under these conditions, cells grew as
nonadherent spherical clusters. The medium was
replenished every 3~4 days, and cells were passaged
weekly. After 7 days of incubation with different
concentrations of metformin or MFB, the formed spheres
were collected by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min
and counted with an inverted phase-contrast Axiovert 25
microscope (Zeiss, Germany). Mammosphere-forming
efficiency (MSFE) was calculated as the number of
sphere-like structures (>100 μm diameter) formed by
day 7 divided by the original number of seeded cells
and expressed as the mean percentage (± standard
deviation, SD).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals

Cell viability assay and combination treatment

Metformin (1,1-dimethybiguanides) and MFB were
obtained from HanAll BioPharma Co., Ltd.

The cytotoxic effects of metformin or MFB on the
various cell lines were evaluated using a CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega). Briefly,
cells were plated in triplicate (1,000 cells per well; 96-well
plates) and incubated in medium containing 10% FBS.
After 24 h, the complete medium was replaced with test
medium containing the vehicle control or various doses of
metformin or MFB for 48 h at 37°C. The Cell-Titer-Glo
assay buffer was then added, and cell viability measured
according to the provided protocol. To assess cytotoxicity,
CD44+CD24-/low and CD44-/lowCD24+ cells were seeded as
described above, treated for 48 h with 10 mM metformin
or MFB, and examined as described above.

Cell culture and mammosphere formation assay
The MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436,
and MDA-MB-157 cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
VA, USA). The SK-BR-3, ZR75-1, Hs578T, BT20,
HCC70, HCC1937, DU4475, HCC38, and T47D cell
lines were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank
(KCLB, Seoul, Korea). BT474 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Incheol Shin (Hanyang University,
Seoul, Korea). These cells were cultured as described in
the ATCC website (www.atcc.org). The MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, and
Hs578T cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Gibco,
CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco). SBCC-1 and SBCC-2 cells
(from invasive breast cancer) and the NDY-1 cell line
(breast sarcoma) were established in our laboratory,
as previously described [48]. All of the other cell lines
were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2, and periodically screened for mycoplasmic
contamination.

Flow cytometric analysis and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS)
Cells were dissociated from spheroids or
monolayers with trypsin-EDTA solution. Suspended cells
were collected by centrifugation and washed with a flow
cytometry buffer comprising PBS containing 0.1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Bovogen Biological, Melbourne,
Australia) and 0.05% sodium azide. Cells (5 x 105)
were stained using the recommended concentrations of
fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against
human CD24 and CD44 (PharMingen Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) for 20 min at RT in the dark. After staining,
cells were washed with 3 ml of flow cytometry buffer
and resuspended in the same buffer. Flow cytometric
analysis was performed by analyzing 5,000 events on
a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For
FACS, single cells were suspended in 1% FBS/PBS
buffer labeled with anti-CD44 (FITC-labeled) and antiCD24 (PE-labeled) and isolated using a FACSAria flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). Routinely, more than 88% of
the sorted cell population was CD44+CD24-/low.

Mammosphere culture and mammosphereforming efficiency (MSFE)
A mammosphere formation assay was performed
to assess the self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Single-cell
suspensions of breast cancer cells were plated at 1,000
cells/mL in serum-free DMEM:F12 medium (3:1 ratio)
supplemented with 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(EGF; Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth

hydrated for 60 minutes at RT, and centrifuged at 750
x g for 2 minutes. After centrifugation, the column was
placed into a collection tube, and 100 ul of purified protein
was collected by centrifugation at 750 x g for 2 minutes.
The concentration of the purified sample was measured
with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and a
NanoPhotometer (Implen, UK).

Apoptosis was detected using an Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD PharMingen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, drug-treated cells
were washed with PBS, mixed with binding buffer, and
then incubated with Annexin V-FITC for 20 min at RT.
The cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI) for 10
min on ice in the dark, and apoptotic cells were measured
by FACS. To further confirm apoptosis, we measured
caspase-3/7 activity with a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay
(Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, the cells were seeded
in 96-well plates under the indicated treatment conditions,
and reagents from the assay kit were added to the culture
medium for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period,
caspase-3/7 activity was measured with a luminometer.

Antibody array assay
The obtained protein sample (50 ug) was brought
to 75 ul with labeling buffer, treated with 3 ul of 10 ug/
ul biotin/DMF solution, and incubated at RT for 1 h with
mixing. Stop reagent (35 ul) was added, and the sample
was incubated at RT for 30 min with mixing. The antibody
microarray slide (Fullmoon Biosystems) was shaken (55
rpm) with 30 ml of blocking solution in a petri dish for 1
h at RT. After blocking, the slide was rinsed with Milli-Q
grade water. The labeled sample was mixed with 6 ml of
coupling solution, and the blocked array slide was shaken
with the coupling mixture (60 rpm) for 2 h at RT in a
coupling dish. The slide was then washed six times with
30 ml of washing solution in a petri dish with shaking (55
rpm) for 5 minutes, and then rinsed with Milli-Q-grade
water. For detection, 30 ul of 0.5 mg/ml Cy3-streptavidin
(GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) was mixed with
30 ml of detection buffer and shaken (55 rpm) with the
coupled array slide for 20 minutes at RT. The slide was
washed six times with 30 ml of washing solution in a petri
dish (55 rpm, 5 minutes each), and rinsed with Milli-Qgrade water.

Western blotting and antibodies
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and
total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM
dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin,
1 mM PMSF). Protein concentrations were measured
with the Bradford assay using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of lysed
proteins were separated by 6 ~ 10% SDS-PAGE, and
the protein bands were electrotransferred to HybondECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Bioscience,
Buckinghamshire, UK). The blots were blocked with
blocking buffer (5% skim milk in TBS-T) for 1 h and
then incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse monoclonal
antibodies against p-AMPK, p-mTOR, snail 2, vimentin,
N-cadherin, ZEB1, or β-actin (Sigma). The blots were
then washed three times in TBS-T, and incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated Affinipure rabbit anti-mouse
IgG (1:5000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) or
peroxidase-conjugated Affinipure mouse anti-rabbit IgG
for 1 h at RT. The immunocomplexes were washed with
TBS-T (three times, 5 min each), and then visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).

Antibody array data acquisition and analysis
Slides were thoroughly dried, and scanned using a
GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instrument, USA). Each
obtained scan image was gridded and quantified using the
GenePix Software (Axon Instrument). The numeric data
were analyzed using the Genowiz 4.0 software (Ocimum
Biosolutions, India), and protein data were annotated
using the UniProt DB (www.uniprot.org).

In vivo xenograft and tumor initiation
experiments
Seven- to eight-week-old female NOD/scid IL2Rg
(null) (NOG) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in accordance with the
standards of the Seoul National University Hospital Animal
Ethics committee (Seoul, Korea). Cells were injected into the
inguinal mammary fat pads of mice, and the engrafted mice
were inspected twice a week for tumor appearance, using
visual observation and palpation. At a tumor diameter of 1
cm or 2-3 months post-transplantation, mice were sacrificed
and analyzed. For the tumor initiation study, MDA-MB-231
cells were treated with 10 mM of metformin or MFB for 16

Sample preparation for the antibody array
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 mM
metformin or MFB for 24 h, The protein was extracted
using protein extraction buffer (Fullmoon Biosystems,
Sunnyvale, CA) containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma), 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)
and lysis beads (Fullmoon Biosystems). The extracted
protein solution was purified using the gel matrix column
provided in the antibody array assay kit (Fullmoon
Biosystems). The column was vortexed for 5 seconds,
