ABSTRACT
Infection-driven inflammation has been proposed to be involved in the
tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral HNSCC is
often colonized with microbes such as gram-positive bacteria and yeast, where ligands
derived from their wall components have been shown to specifically bind to Toll-like
receptor 2 (TLR2). Although TLR2 has been described to be expressed in oral HNSCC,
its function has not been well characterized. Here, we show the expression of TLR2 in
both HNSCC cell lines and primary patient-derived HNSCC xenograft tumors. Activation
of TLR2 with a yeast-derived ligand of TLR2, zymosan, promoted organoid formation
in an ex vivo model of tumor growth, while blockade with anti-TLR2 antibodies
inhibited organoid formation. Zymosan also induced phosphorylation of ERK and the
p65 subunit of NF-κB, which was inhibited in the presence of anti-TLR2 antibodies,
indicating that this receptor is functional in HNSCC and that the signaling through
these pathways is intact. TLR2 blockade also inhibited growth of human xenografted
tumors in immunodeficient mice. In summary, our data show that TLR2 is a functional
receptor expressed in human HNSCC that plays a direct pro-tumorigenic role, and that
it can be therapeutically targeted with blocking antibodies to reduce tumor growth.

infection-driven inflammation has been proposed to be
involved in 15–20% of human tumors [11, 12]. This is
particularly relevant in the case of oral head and neck
carcinomas where poor oral hygiene has been linked
to increased risk of cancer in several studies [13–15].
Dysplastic mucosal lesions are often super-colonized with
microbes, and this colonization has been independently
associated with disease progression [15, 16].
The host recognizes invading pathogens via myriad
pattern recognition receptors that bind to evolutionarily
conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern motifs
(PAMPs) [17]. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family
is a well-described family of membrane-associated
proteins that detect and alert the host about incoming
pathogens [18–21]. PAMPS such as bacterial wall
components, flagella, LPS, ds-RNA, and DNA, bind to

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) is the most common malignancy of the upper
aerodigestive tract and affects 50, 000 Americans each
year [1]. It poses a major health problem with a 5-year
survival rate of merely 50% in tobacco-related cases
[2]. The treatment for HNSCC is based on surgery,
radio- and chemo- therapy, but is fraught with frequent
treatment failures and complications. While smoking
[3], consumption of alcohol [4, 5] and exposure to HPV
[6–8] are well-described etiologic factors of head and
neck carcinoma, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms by which dysplastic lesions progress
to carcinoma. Inflammation is gaining recognition
as an important driver of tumorigenesis [9, 10], and

TLRs and activate downstream signaling via adaptor
molecules MyD88/TRIF with resultant activation of
NF-κB and MAPK pathways [22, 23]. TLRs, which
are commonly known to be expressed on immune
cells [24], orchestrate host responses by leading to
maturation of antigen presenting cells, upregulation
of co-stimulatory signals, and production of various
cytokines and chemokines [25]. It is well understood
that TLR stimulation can play an adjuvant role on
the immune system and induce anti-tumor responses
[26–28]. More recently, however, several TLRs were
found to be expressed on a variety of epithelial tissues and
epithelial derived tumors [25], and several studies have
supported the notion that TLRs may also play a direct
pro-tumorigenic role [29–34].
One of the TLR family members, TLR2, is activated
by ligands derived from the wall components of grampositive bacteria and yeast. In oral SCC, which is often
colonized with these microbes, TLR2 expression has been
described [35, 36]. In particular, several reports have
also described an association between oral colonization
with yeast and oral epithelial dysplasia [16, 37, 38]. The
function of TLR2 in the progression of this malignancy,
however, has not been well characterized. Recently,
we demonstrated a role for the TLR2/MyD88 pathway
in breast and colon epithelial stem/progenitor cell
populations [39]. Here, we report that TLR2 is expressed
in both HNSCC cell lines and primary patient-derived
xenografts and using a yeast-derived agonist, zymosan, we
demonstrate that this receptor is functional. Importantly,
we show that activation of the receptor has tumor growthpromoting effects, and conversely, antibody targeting of
the receptor profoundly inhibits growth.

increase in the size of the organoids (Fig. 1B  and 1C),
again indicating that the receptor is functional and has
a growth-promoting effect on these cells. Of note, the
absolute number of organoids was not consistently affected
by the addition of zymosan (Supplemental Fig. 1A), but
the individual and aggregate size of the organoids was
significantly increased, suggesting that activation of TLR2
may have a profound effect in vivo.
Given these observations with the HNSCC cell
lines, we next assessed the expression of TLR2 in patientderived xenografts (PDX), established from oral squamous
cell carcinoma specimens obtained from patients
undergoing surgical resection of their tumors. Again,
we observed that all of the specimens had a significant
proportion of tumor cells with high expression of TLR2,
as assessed by flow cytometry (mean 61.8%, s.d. 21.2)
(Fig. 2A and 2B). Dissociated cells from three of these
PDX tumors reliably formed organoids in 3D cultures
by day 14 (Fig. 2C). As observed with the cell lines,
exposure of the primary tumor cells to α-TLR2 mAb
inhibited organoid growth (Fig. 2C and 2D), indicating
that constitutive activation of the receptor was promoting
growth in this context. Activation of TLR2 by zymosan
resulted in a robust increase in the size of the organoids
(Fig. 2C and 2D). Again, the absolute number of organoids
was not consistently affected by the addition of zymosan,
(Supplemental Fig. 1B), similar to what was observed with
the cell lines. Further, the increased growth associated with
the addition of zymosan was significantly abrogated by the
preincubation and co-culture of the cells with an α-TLR2
mAb, indicating that the effects observed with zymosan
were specific to its actions on TLR2. Thus, targeting of
TLR2 by the α-TLR2 mAb was able to inhibit both the
constitutive and inducible growth-promoting effects of
TLR2 in these PDX cells.

RESULTS

TLR2 signaling through the NF-κB and MAPK
pathways is intact in HNSCC and can be blocked
by anti-TLR2 antibody

TLR2 is expressed on HNSCC cells and
promotes tumor growth
We assessed the expression of TLR2 on established
HNSCC cell lines (SCC4, UM-SCC-6, UPCI:SCC103
and PCI-13) by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A), and observed
that all four cell lines uniformly expressed the receptor.
To determine if TLR2 has a functional role in the growth
of HNSCC, we first assessed whether a monoclonal
antibody (α-TLR2 mAb, clone T2.5) known to block
TLR2 signaling [40], would have any effect on these cell
lines in a 3D in vitro organoid model of tumor growth.
Addition of the α-TLR2 mAb to the organoid cultures
resulted in significant reduction of organoid sizes in all cell
lines compared to the isotype control (Fig. 1B and 1C),
indicating that constitutive activation of the receptor
promotes tumor growth. Furthermore, experimental
activation of the receptor with a well-characterized yeastderived ligand of TLR2, zymosan, resulted in a significant

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Because we observed significant inhibition of
zymosan-induced tumor growth with an α-TLR2 mAb,
we assessed if zymosan could induce the activation of
signaling pathways downstream of TLR2. Although
activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways by TLR2 is
well described in immune cells, little is known about
TLR2 signaling in HNSCC. To investigate this, HNSCC
cells were incubated in low-serum conditions with
zymosan, and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NFκB and ERK was assessed by Western immunoblot over a
time course. Exposure of the cells to zymosan resulted in
increased phosphorylation of p65 and ERK at 30 minutes,
with levels returning to baseline by 90 minutes after
stimulation. Interestingly, the addition of zymosan was
able to increase phosphorylation of p65 and ERK above

in α-TLR2 mAb – treated tumor cells even in the absence
of zymosan (Supplemental Fig. 2), indicating the presence
of a growth-promoting effect from constitutive TLR2
activation, similar to our in vitro studies (Fig. 1C and 2D);
however, the antibody-induced reduction in tumor size
was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, these data
indicated that targeting TLR2 on HNSCC cells inhibits
tumor formation in vivo.
In a manner similar to the cell lines, dissociated
PDX tumor cells were also treated either with α-TLR-2
mAb or isotype control IgG and then subsequently treated
with zymosan and implanted into immunodeficient Rag2-/Il2rg-/- mice. Again, we observed a significant reduction in
tumor volume and mass ( p = 0.04, and 0.04 respectively,
Fig. 4C and 4D). Importantly, the single treatment with the

α-TLR2 mAb had a durable effect on the growth of these
tumors. Thus, targeting TLR2 in HNSCC appears to be an
effective strategy to inhibit tumor growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that there is significant
expression of TLR2 on HNSCC cells and that this receptor
is functional with intact signaling through the NF-κB and
MAPK pathways. Importantly, the activation of TLR2
confers a growth-promoting effect on these cells, and
blockade of the receptor using a monoclonal antibody
has a profound inhibitory effect on tumor growth in both
in vitro organoid and in vivo xenograft models.

Our data indicate that there is a constitutive basal
and inducible activation of TLR2 in HNSCC. This is based
on our findings that treatment with α-TLR2 mAb alone led
to a reduction in organoid growth and the observation that
there was constitutive phosphorylation of p65 and ERK
in these cells. These findings are in line with the known
constitutive activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways
in HNSCC. The activation of these pathways has been
associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory and
pro-angiogenic factors that can enhance tumor growth [41,
42]. We hypothesize that the activation of these pathways
through TLR2 would likely be more pronounced in the
context of oral head and neck pre-malignant and malignant
lesions that are chronically exposed to large amounts of
bacterial and fungal elements.
The role of TLR activation in cancer has been
unclear. Expression of the TLR adaptor protein MyD88
has been associated with a more aggressive hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) phenotype in humans [43, 44], and
activating mutations have been found in diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma [45]. Moreover we recently showed a
cell-intrinsic role for the TLR2/MyD88 pathway in breast
and colon epithelial stem/progenitor cell populations, and
similar to what we describe here in HNSCC, the inhibition
of the TLR2 signaling pathway in breast cancer resulted
significant growth inhibition [39]. While there is data that
TLR2 has a pro-tumorigenic role in a model of HCC,
there is also data pointing to an increased aggressive
tumor behavior in HCC in TLR2 deficient mice [46, 47].
In colon carcinoma, activation of TLR9 has been shown
to favor survival and chemotherapy resistance of tumor
cells [48, 49]. Some of the conflicting results may lie in
the fact that the TLRs can have both a role in the immune
system and directly on the tumor cells. In the case of oral
HNSCC, TLR4 stimulation with LPS has been shown
to confer resistance to tumor lysis by natural killer cells
and promote survival [49]. These data are supported by
studies in non-small cell lung cancer showing that TLR4
stimulation enhances tumor survival in vitro and in vivo in
murine models [50]. In contrast, there are several studies
that have implicated an anti-tumorigenic role for TLR
signaling. TLR4 single nucleotide polymorphisms with
reduced response to LPS have been shown to be associated
with a worse prognosis in HNSCC [46]. TLR3 has been
shown to inhibit cell growth and directly induce apoptosis
in vitro in oral head and neck cell lines [46]. Adjuvant
effects of TLR stimulation on the immune system are well
described and several TLR ligands are currently in use or
under investigation as adjunctive anti-tumor therapeutics
[20, 51]. Thus, in the planning of therapeutic strategies for
targeting the TLRs, it will be very important to consider
the direct effects on both the immune system and the
tumor cells themselves. Importantly, a humanized IgG4
monoclonal antagonistic antibody, OPN-305, is already
in clinical trials for post-transplant delayed graft function
[52]. The antibody was able to produce full TLR2 receptor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

blockade on monocytes and was well tolerated. While it
is true that inhibition of the immune response to cancer
is a potential concern, there is significant evidence that
inflammatory states can be tumor promoting [10]. There
is, thus, a need for further investigation to better delineate
TLR2′s roles in HNSCC and to determine if it can be
manipulated for chemoprevention strategies of high-risk
inflammatory associated premalignant lesions.
In conclusion, TLR2 is highly expressed in HNSCC
cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts, and
activation of this receptor confers a growth advantage
in vivo likely through activation of NF-κB and MAPK
pathways. These data are of particular importance in the
case of oral HNSCC and precancerous lesions where
treatment with α-TLR2 antibodies or reduction of the
microbial load may have significant effects on disease
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The human HNSCC cell line UM-SCC-6 was
obtained from Dr. Thomas Carey at the University of
Michigan. The SCC-4 cell line was obtained from ATCC.
The UPCI:SCC103 and PCI-13 cell lines were kind
gifts from Dr. Suzanne Gollin and Dr. Jennifer Grandis
at the University of Pittsburgh. Cells were maintained in
DMEM/F-12 medium with Glutamax (Gibco, Invitrogen)
containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Cellgro), 100 IU/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen).
The cells were incubated in humidified air with 5% CO2 at
37°C, and sub-cultured twice a week with 0.25% trypsin
and 0.02% EDTA.

Primary human tumors and patient-derived
xenografts
Tumor specimens were procured through the
Stanford University Tissue Bank, through a protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board. Dissociated
tumor cells were implanted into the subcutaneous
compartment of Rag2-/–Il2rg–/– immunodeficient mice, in
accordance with the Stanford University Administrative
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Briefly, mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane-oxygen, and cells immersed in
Matrigel (BD, Pharmingen) were injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of mice. Mice were monitored for tumor
growth, and xenograft tumors were harvested when they
reached a maximum size of 1 cm in diameter.

Tumor digestion
Tumors were mechanically and enzymatically
dissociated and digested in a solution of 300 U/ml
collagenase and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase (StemCell

resuspended in 100 μl of culture media were added on top
of the Matrigel and feeder cells in each well.
For the cell lines, the culture media used
was DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. For primary human tumors and
patient-derived xenografts, Clevers media was used,
which comprised DMEM/F-12 medium, 10 mM
HEPES, 1 × Glutamax, 10% FBS, 1 × N-2 supplement
(Gibco), 1 × B-27 supplement (Gibco), 500 ng/ml human
R-Spondin 3 (R&D Systems), 10 ng/ml human EGF
(PeproTech), and 100 ng/ml human Noggin (PeproTech).
Organoids were grown in humidified tissue
culture incubators at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 20% O2 and
monitored daily under a microscope. Media supplemented
with 5 μg/ml α-TLR2 antibody, 5 μg/ml mIgG1 antibody,
or 10 μg/ml zymosan was changed twice a week.

5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1 x penicillinstreptomycin-amphotericin B (MP Biomedicals), and
25 mM HEPES, at 37°C for 3 h. The dissociated cells were
spun down and resuspended in Trypsin-EDTA (StemCell
Technologies) for 3 min, then further dissociated with prewarmed 5 mg/ml dispase (StemCell Technologies) and
0.1 mg/ml DNase I (StemCell Technologies) for 1 min.
Cells were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed
with culture media and used for assays.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were stained with a panel of antibodies in
PBS containing 2% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and
1 mM EDTA. Tumor cells from primary tumor samples
were identified by gating out leukocytes, endothelial, and
stromal cells expressing human lineage markers: CD2
(RPA-2.10), CD3 (UCHT1), CD18 (6.7), CD31 (WM59),
CD45 (HI30), and CD64 (10.1). Tumor cells from
xenografts passaged in mice were identified by gating
out stromal cells expressing mouse lineage markers:
H-2Kd (SF1–1.1), H-2Kb (AF6–88.5) and muCD45 (30–
F11). Anti-CD31 was obtained from eBioscience, and all
other antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen. All
lineage antibodies were biotinylated or directly conjugated
to PE/Cy5. Labeled cells were then washed and stained
with streptavidin-PE/Cy5 (BioLegend). DAPI was
obtained from Invitrogen.
After gating out leukocytes, endothelial, stromal,
and non-viable cells, the tumor cells were profiled for
expression of TLR2. Anti-TLR2 (T2.5) was obtained from
eBioscience. Cells were analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa.
Events collected were analyzed using FlowJo Version
9.6.4 software (Tree Star).

Measurements of organoid formation
Organoids were cultured in eight replicate wells for
each treatment condition, and one image from each well
was photographed on day 14 of culture. The images were
analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH) to determine the total
area and number of organoids formed.

SDS electrophoresis and western blotting
Cells were plated onto 12- or 24-well plates, and
treated with 5 μg/ml of antibodies for 1 h. After 1 h,
10 μg/ml of zymosan was added. Cells were lysed by
adding cold 1 x SDS loading buffer into the wells. Cell
lysates were collected, boiled for 5 minutes, and loaded
in precast 4–12% gradient gels (Life Technologies). After
separation of proteins via electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked
with 5% milk in TBST (Cell Signaling) for 1 h. Primary
detection antibody was diluted in 5% BSA and TBST for
phospho blots and 5% milk and TBST for non-phospho
blots. Secondary goat-anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies
conjugated to HRP were used for chemiluminescent
detection with WesternBright ECL HRP substrate
(Advansta). Phospho-ERK antibody (E-4, sc-7383), and
ERK 2 antibody (K-23, sc-153) were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser536) (93H1,
3033S) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.

Reagents and blocking antibodies
For the TLR2 blocking experiments, tumor cells
were treated with 5 μg/ml α-TLR2 (T2.5, BioLegend,
eBioscience), or 5 μg/ml mIgG1 isotype control (MOPC21, BioLegend) antibodies. For the organoid assays and
in vivo tumor assays, the TLR2 ligand zymosan was
obtained from Novus Biologicals (NBP2–26233). For the
western blots, zymosan was obtained from Santa Cruz
(sc-258367). Zymosan was added to assays at a
concentration of 10 μg/ml.

was assessed using calipers three times per week. Mice
injected with UPCI:SCC103 and S-SCC7055 cells were
euthanized before the 4th week due to tumor size. The
length and width of the tumors were measured, and tumor
volume was calculated according to the following formula:

one-way-ANOVA test with Dunn’s post-hoc test for
multiple comparisons was used for comparing the total
area measurements in the organoid assays.
