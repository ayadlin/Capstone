ABSTRACT
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) is one of the core subunits
of the translation initiation complex eIF3, responsible for ribosomal subunit joining
and mRNA recruitment to the ribosome. Our previous study identified that it was
correlated with platinum response in lung cancer. The current study aims to test
the hypothesis that eIF3a may affect the drug response and prognosis of ovarian
cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy by regulating xeroderma
pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) and p27Kip1. Immunohistochemistry and
western blot was used to determine the expression of eIF3a in 126 human ovarian
cancer tissues followed by association analysis of eIF3a expression with patient’s
response and survival. Ectopic over-expression and RNA interference knockdown
of eIF3a were carried out in A2780/cisplatin (DDP) and its parental A2780 cells,
respectively, to determine the effect of altered eIF3a expression on cellular response
to cisplatin by employing MTT assay. Western Blot analyses were also carried out
to determine the regulation of eIF3a on XPC and p27Kip1. eIF3a expression was
associated with response of ovarian cancer patients to DDP-based chemotherapy and
their survival. Overexpression and knockdown of eIF3a increased and decreased the
cellular response to cisplatin in A2780/DDP and A2780 cells, respectively. In addition,
XPC and p27Kip1 were down regulated by eIF3a. eIF3a improves ovarian cancer
patients’ response to DDP-based chemotherapy via down regulating XPC and p27Kip1.

first-line treatment for advanced disease with primary
debulking surgery, followed by cisplatin (DDP)-based
chemotherapy, more than 70% of the patients eventually
relapse developing drug-resistant disease [3]. In addition,
although patients may respond firstly to the therapy, the
cancer often becomes resistant to further chemotherapy,
at this point, the number of effective treatment options
is limited. Therefore, for EOC, clinically useful markers
that identify DDP resistant tumors among the overall high
number of chemosensitive patients, remains a critical
need. If identified early, DDP resistant EOC patients could
benefit from alternate and/or additional therapeutic options

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the
most common gynecologic malignancies, and the fifth
most frequent cause of death by cancer in women in
the United States [1]. In China, EOC is also one of the
top 10 most commonly cancers in the female population.
In 2011, the total ovarian cancer cases in China were
45,233 and the incidence was 6.89/105, which account
for 3.11% for all female cancer patients [2]. The
patients are commonly diagnosed lately with advanced
disease. In spite of high response rates to the standard

in first-line therapy. Moreover, reliable early identification
of DDP resistance may allow the development of clinical
trials specifically targeting this population with novel
alternate therapies.
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3a
(eIF3a) is one of the core subunits of the translation
initiation complex eIF3, responsible for ribosomal subunit
joining and mRNA recruitment to the ribosome [4]. It is
known to play an important role in translation initiation
as well as in the regulation of various gene products,
including tubulin, ribonucleotide reductase M2 and some
DNA repair molecules [5–7]. These proteins influence cell
growth, proliferation [5], cell cycle [8], differentiation [9],
cancer progression and the DNA repair pathways [10, 11].
In our previous study, eIF3a up-regulation was identified
to be correlated with better prognosis and response to
DDP-based chemotherapy in lung cancer patients [12, 13].
Our in vitro study also showed that eIF3a knockdown or
overexpression, respectively, increased and decreased the
cellular resistance to DDP and anthrocycline anticancer
drugs [12, 14]. Furthermore, some eIF3a polymorphisms
were potentially considered as tools for diagnosis and
pretreatment evaluation of DDP-based chemotherapy in
breast [15] and lung cancer [16, 17]. Therefore, eIF3a
is emerging as a regulator and potential DDP-based
chemotherapy response marker.
The xeroderma pigmentosum complementation
group C (XPC) protein plays an important role in the
nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. It is involved in
the recognition and initiation of the NER, which plays an
important role in removing damaged genes, maintaining
the genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis.
It was reported that the regulation of XPC expression is
associated with platinum response. p27kip1 is an important
inhibitory protein of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs),
it plays a fundamental role in cell cycle progression.
The regulation of p27kip1 expression occurs at different
levels and it was reported that eIF3a negatively regulating
translation of p27kip1. Thus, we investigated the role of
these two proteins in eIF3a regulating ovarian cancer
platinum response.
In this study, we explored the role of eIF3a in DDP
response in ovarian cancer treatments. We found that eIF3a
expression correlated with response of ovarian cancer
patients to DDP-based chemotherapy. Its knockdown
or ectopic overexpression, respectively, increased and
decreased the cellular resistance to cisplatin.

and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 1B and 1C),
respectively. To confirm the results of IHC, we further
analyzed eIF3a expression by Western Blot in some
randomly selected samples, as indicated in Figure 1D, the
results of both detection methods were consistent with
each other. Then, we explored the association of eIF3a
expression with chemotherapy response, the results were
summarized in Table 1. eIF3a staining did not appear
to have any significant correlation with the age and
histologic type listed in the table. However, eIF3a staining
had significant correlation with chemotherapy responses
of DDP (P = 0.002). In general, chemotherapy sensitive
patients had higher eIF3a expression. Approximately
59.5% of DDP-sensitive EOC patients had high eIF3a
level, these numbers go down to 40.5% for DDP-resistance
EOC patients (Figure 1E). Thus, the level of eIF3a
expression correlates with chemotherapy responses of
EOC patients and the increased eIF3a expression may
increase chemosensitivity.

Higher eIF3a expression patients have better
prognosis
To further investigate the relationship between eIF3a
expression and EOC prognosis, we conducted the survival
analysis for these patients. As indicated in Table 2,
In multivariable Cox regression analysis, eIF3a expression
was a significant independent factor that correlated with
the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS)
of EOC patients (P < 0.001 for both). In addition, the
postoperative 1, 3, and 5 year OS rates of EOC patients
with eIF3a high expression group were significantly
higher than those with eIF3a low expression (Figure 2).

eIF3a increase DDP sensitive in ovarian
cancer cells
Based on our previous results that eIF3a expression
correlated with DDP resistant in lung cancer, we next
tested whether eIF3a also affected DDP response in EOC
cell lines. The parental A2780 and its DDP resistant
derivative A2780/DDP cells were used in the current
study, as shown in Figure 3A, the A2780/DDP cells were
obviously more resistant to DDP. And the eIF3a protein
level in A2780 was significantly higher than that in
A2780/DDP cells (Figure 3B), indicating that eIF3a may
be correlated with DDP resistance. Then, we conducted the
experiments of knockdown and overexpression of eIF3a in
A2780 and A2780/DDP cells, respectively. As indicated
in Figure 3C, eIF3a expression was successfully reduced
by siRNA and up-regulated by eIF3a open reading frame
(ORF) clone transfection, as determined by using western
blot analyses. These cells were then subjected to methyl
thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, the results showed
that A2780 cells with down-regulated eIF3a were more
resistant to DDP (Figure 3D). In contrary, the A2780/DDP

vector control (Figure 3E). Thus, we concluded that
overexpression of eIF3a increased DDP response in the
EOC cells.

proposed that eIF3a might also regulate the expression
of these two proteins in ovarian cancer cells. To test this
possibility, we examined whether altering eIF3a level
affects their expression using both A2780 cells with
eIF3a knockdown and A2780/DDP cells with eIF3a
overexpression. As shown in Figure 4, the protein level of
p27Kip1 and XPC were all decreased in A2780/DDP cells
with eIF3 overexpression compared with vector control,
whereas the expression of these two proteins in A2780
cells with eIF3a knockdown increased compared with the
scramble control.

eIF3a regulated p27Kip1 and XPC expression
Previously, we have shown that eIF3a played an
important role in regulating the translation of a subset
of mRNAs including p27Kip1 and XPC [5, 6]. We thus

DISCUSSION

development of human breast cancers [15]. In addition,
eIF3a was also found to be elevated in a number of other
cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma of the oral
cavity (OSCC), lung, cervix, esophagus, stomach and
colon cancers [7]. These results indicated that eIF3a
played important roles in oncogenesis and was a potential
oncogene.
Our previous study further identified that eIF3a
also contributed to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients’ response to platinum-based chemotherapy
by regulating the expression of some DNA repair
proteins [12]. However, whether eIF3a also has similar
function in other cancers still remains unknown. In the
current study, we demonstrated that eIF3a also correlated
with DDP-based chemotherapy responses and survival
of ovarian cancer patients. Patients with high eIF3a
expression had both better chemosensitivity and OS rate.
Based on this and our previous study, we temporarily

In the current study, we found that eIF3a was highly
expressed in DDP sensitive EOC patients compared with
DDP resistance EOC patients, and higher eIF3a expression
patients have better prognosis. We further showed that
eIF3a increased DDP response in the EOC cells by
conducting experiments of knockdown and overexpression
in A2780 and A2780/DDP cells, respectively. Also, we
identified that XPC and p27Kip1 were down regulated by
eIF3a (Figure 5).
eIF3a was firstly found to be over expressed in
breast cancer compared with paired normal tissues, it
was thus intensively investigated in breast cancers [18].
RNA sequencing identified that eIF3a was involved in
the growth and migration of breast cancer MCF-7 cells
[19]. Its genetic variations (rs10787899 and rs3824830)
were also reported to be strongly associated with the

survival.

speculate that eIF3a maybe also correlated with the
chemosensitivity of platinum in patients with other
cancers. Platinum is widely used to treat many cancers,
however, resistance is one of the major obstacles for
successful chemotherapy. Thus, predicting drug response
before the initiation of chemotherapy may help to choose
most proper treatment strategies for each patient and
improve platinum therapeutic effect. Our result unveils
that eIF3a is a possible molecular marker for the prediction
and assessing its level may help design individualized
treatment strategies.
In addition, we observed the association between
eIF3a expression and patient survival. Based on our
analysis, eIF3a was an independent factor that affected
the EOC patients survival. eIF3a high expression group
had higher OS and RFS rates. This result is consistent
with our previous study in lung cancer patents [13].
Furthermore, another two studies also demonstrated
that high eIF3a level had better survival than that with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

low eIF3a expression in cervical and esophageal cancer
patients [20, 21]. It is interesting to note that platinum
is one of the major chemotherapeutic drugs for all these
three cancers. We thus further hypothesize that high eIF3a
expression level in variant cancer patients may contribute
to better survival after receiving platinum chemotherapy.
XPC encodes a component of the NER pathway,
which is the primary repair system for removing bulky
DNA lesions formed by platinum. It plays essential role
in the early stages of global genome repair (GGR) NER
pathway with major function of damage recognition [22].
Its polymorphisms were reported to be associated with
platinum-based chemotherapy response [23]. p27Kip1
is an inhibitor of CDKs and plays important role in
regulating cell cycle and growth arrest. It is also reported
to be correlated with platinum resistance [24]. In the
current study, both XPC and p27Kip1 was down regulated
by eIF3a, which was in agreement with our previous
finds in the lung cancer. This result further demonstrated
25447

Oncotarget

that in addition to NER DNA repair pathway which was
investigated previously, cell cycle also plays important
role in the sensitization of eIF3a to ovarian cell response to
DDP. However, the detail mechanisms and whether other
cell cycle related proteins are also under eIF3a regulation
require further investigation.
It should be note that the present study has several
limitations. Firstly, we only investigated XPC and p27Kip1,
however, there are some other proteins in NER DNA repair
pathway also under eIF3a regulation. The role of these
molecules in eIF3a regulating ovarian cancer platinum
response still remains unclear. Secondly, the sample size in
the current study was relative small. Thus, the correlation
of eIF3a expression and ovarian cancer patients survival
need to be validated in a larger sample size population.
Finally, for EOC patients, the marker differentiating
benign and malignant ovarian diseases is very important.
However, the eIF3a expression level in the benign ovarian
diseases was not reported. It is still not clear if eIF3a was
such a potential marker. We will investigate this possibility
in the future.
In summary, we showed that eIF3a expression level
correlates with responses of ovarian cancer patients to
DDP-based chemotherapy and their survival. We also
showed that eIF3a may regulate the response of ovarian
cancer cells to DDP via down regulating XPC and p27Kip1.
The current study indicated that eIF3a may represent a
new prognostic marker predicting DDP response and
survival of EOC patients.

All collected tissues were embedded in paraffin after
fixation in 10% formalin for histological diagnosis and
IHC analysis. Among which, 46 randomly selected fresh
specimens of DDP sensitive EOC samples (n = 23) and
DDP resistance EOC samples (n = 23) were also collected
for western blot analysis. The eligible patients for the
study had to meet the following criteria: (a) histologically
confirmed ovarian cancer; (b) receiving no radiotherapy
and biological therapy before chemotherapy; (c) having
been treated with more than 3 cycles of DDP-based
chemotherapy as a first-line treatment; (d) with primary
ovarian tumors; and (e) having undergone full follow-up
at the hospital after treatment and been evaluated for
response of chemotherapy. Patients who had the evidence
of disease progression on primary treatment or within
6 months from the end of primary treatment are deemed
as platinum resistant, while those had no evidence of
disease progression within 6 months of the end of primary
treatment are classified as platinum sensitive [25].
Exclusion criteria include: (a) pregnancy or
lactation; (b) active infection; (c) symptomatic brain or
leptomeningeal metastases; and (d) previous or other
concomitant malignancies. All of the patients were staged
according to the International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical staging system [26]. All
other demographic and clinical information were obtained
from the 2 hospitals mentioned earlier.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patient follow-up was terminated on July 14,
2014. Average follow-up time was 48.32 months
(median 56.0 months; range 2–60 months). OS was defined
as the interval in months between EOC resection and death
or the last observation. RFS was defined as the months of
surgery to identification of relapse from any cause. Patients
alive at the end of follow-up were censored. To determine
factors influencing survival after operation, 5 conventional
variables along with the expression of eIF3a were tested in
all participants. All research protocols strictly complied with
REMARK guidelines for reporting prognostic biomarkers
in cancer [27].

Follow-up and candidate prognostic factors

Materials
Cisplatin, β-actin antibody and thiazolyl blue
tetrazolium bromide were purchased from Sigma
(St  Louis, Missouri, USA). Antibodies against eIF3a,
XPC and p27kip1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, California, USA). Cell culture media and
reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
California, USA). All other reagents were of molecular
biology grade.

Selection of study population and acquisition of
clinical information

Cell culture and transfections
A2780 cell line was purchased from Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China). The cells were cultured in low
glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Media (DMEM,
GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) at 37°C under
an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. DDP-resistant
cell line A2780/DDP derived from its parental ovarian
cancer cell line A2780 by applying stepwise increases
in concentrations of DDP. The A2780/DDP cells were
incubated in 1 μM of DDP.

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South
University. All patients were provided written informed
consent in compliance with the code of ethics of the
World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).
Eligible patients were from Hunan Provincial Tumor
Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, China) or Xiangya Hospital
(Changsha, Hunan, China) and diagnosed between March
2008 and March 2012. In this study, a total of 126 human
ovarian cancer samples were collected after surgery.

Real-time RT-PCR

For the transfection, 2 μg DNA and 10 nM
siRNA were transfected into A2780/DDP and A2780
cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine2000TM
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. After
transfection for 48 h, cells were subjected to MTT assay
or harvested and stored as cell pellets at −80oC until use.

RT-PCR was carried out as previously described
[31]. Briefly, 1 μg total RNAs were isolated by using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used
for reverse transcription by using primescript 1st strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according
to the manufacturers’ instructions. Real-time PCR were
carried out in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by using SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The threshold cycle (Ct) of each reaction
was determined and normalized to that of β-actin internal
control.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections (4 μm thick) were prepared from
paraffin embedded blocks. After antigen retrieval treatment
in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 10 min,
immunostaining was performed using the Envision System
(Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) with diaminobenzidine. The
tissue sections were then stained for eIF3a detection
using a mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:400),
and a subsequently streptavidin-peroxidase system
(ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China). The negative controls
for IHC were carried out under the same experimental
conditions by omitting the primary antibody. The
semiquantitation for intensity was scored on a scale
of 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong)
[28]. We also evaluated the approximate proportion of
cells showing immunoreactive score (0 (<1%), 1 (single
to 5%), 2 (6–50%), 3 (51–75%) and 4 (>75%)) to give
information about the relative number of positive cells
within the specimen (frequency score) [29]. These two
kinds of scores were then multiplied to generate the IS
for each tissue specimen. Receive operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis was employed to assess cutoff score
for overexpression of eIF3a. The score was selected as the
cut-off value, which was closest to the point of maximum
Youden’s index (sensitivity + specificity−1) was used for
determination of optimal cut-off values of the diagnostic
tests. OC case designated as “negative expression” for
eIF3a was those with scores below or equal to the cutoff
value (IS < 2), while “positive expression” tumors were
those with scores above the value (IS ≥ 2).

Western blot analysis
Total protein was extracted and separated by
SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA). The blocked
membranes were then respectively incubated with
the primary antibodies at 4°C overnight followed
by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (KPL,
Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, 1:3000 dilution) for
1 hour at 37°C. Bands were visualized using the enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, California, USA). The target signals were quantified
by BandScan software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
California, USA) and defined as the ratio of target protein
relative to β-actin.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0
software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Kruskall-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney U nonparametric tests were utilized
to compare differences of eIF3a expression levels. The
differences of eIF3a expression level in patients were
analyzed using chi-square test. The cumulative OS and
RFS were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and
the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression
model was used to determine if eIF3a expression is an
independent prognostic indicator. All the tests were
two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.

MTT assay
The cell growth rate was determined by using MTT
assay as we described previously [12, 30]. In briefly,
cells were seeded in 96-well plates and allowed to grow
for 24 hours followed by incubation with different
concentrations of DDP for another 96 hours. Culture
medium was then removed and cells were incubated with
1 mg/mL thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide for 4 hours
at 37oC. The formazan was then solubilized in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and OD 570 nm was measured by
a TECAN M200pro NanoQuant microplate reader
(Männedorf, Switzerland). Finally, the dose-survival
curves were drawn by GraphPad Prism 5.0 program
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).
