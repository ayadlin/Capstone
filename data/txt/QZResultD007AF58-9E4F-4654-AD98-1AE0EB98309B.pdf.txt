BACKGROUND: Despite initial treatment with high-dose methotrexate-based regimens, many patients with primary
central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) relapse and die from their disease. No standard of care exists at progression or relapse, but chemotherapy and in some cases radiation are usually used. Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate, similar to methotrexate, but with a broader spectrum of activity. Because methotrexate is an integral part of
PCSNL treatment, the authors assessed the antitumor activity and safety of pemetrexed in recurrent PCNSL.
METHODS: Patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL were enrolled in this trial. Treatment consisted of pemetrexed
900 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks with low-dose dexamethasone, folate, and B12 supplementation. Each cycle was 6
weeks, and follow-up imaging was done before each new cycle. Treatment was continued until complete remission,
progression, or toxicity. RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated, with a median age of 69.8 years and Karnofsky performance status of 70%; 10 of 11 patients had failed prior high-dose methotrexate. The median number of pemetrexed
cycles given was 5, with an associated overall response rate of 55% and disease control rate of 91%. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 45%, median PFS was 5.7 months, and median overall survival was 10.1 months. Toxicities were primarily hematologic and infectious. CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed has single-agent activity in relapsed/
refractory PCNSL. Toxicities were seen likely because of the higher than standard dose used. Further investigation of
this agent or other multitargeted antifolates in PCNSL is warranted to determine optimal dose and efficacy in a more

INTRODUCTION
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an aggressive tumor limited to the central nervous system
(CNS). Untreated, patients survive only a few months; however, in the last 2 decades, it has become apparent that highdose (HD) methotrexate-based regimens can lead to median survivals of 30 to 50 months.1-6 Despite aggressive therapy,
however, nearly 50% of patients will relapse within 24 months of diagnosis. Furthermore, the expectant survival after
relapse of PCNSL is between 2 months and 14 months, with most series reporting about 4 months to 8 months, depending on whether further treatment is instituted.3,7-9 There is no standard salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory
patients, although numerous approaches have been tried using radiation therapy (RT) or chemotherapy with variable
degrees of activity. Unfortunately, the majority of patients with relapsed PCNSL still die from their disease.10-14
Given the poor outcomes for these patients, new and novel agents should be evaluated. Pemetrexed (Alimta; Lilly Oncology, Indianapolis, Ind) has antifolate activity, similar to methotrexate, but with the advantage of targeting >1 site in folate

metabolism. It interrupts purine synthesis via thymidylate
synthase and dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, and
pyrimidine synthesis via glycinamide ribonucleotide
formyltransferase and aminoimidazole carboxamide formyltransferase inhibition.15 We performed a trial using
pemetrexed in patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL to
determine single-agent activity; this was part of a larger
single-institution trial assessing pemetrexed activity in
recurrent gliomas, PCSNL, and brain metastases
(NCT00276783). Our objective was to assess for singleagent activity based on response rates, progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months (PFS-6), median PFS, overall survival (OS), and toxicity in 10 to 12 patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All patients signed an institutional review board-approved
consent form before study enrollment and treatment.
Patients were required to have a diagnosis of recurrent or
refractory PCNSL, have a Karnofsky performance status
(KPS) of 60, and be >18 years of age. Measurable disease was required to assess response. Patients had to have
failed at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and were
required to be >4 weeks from prior RT if this modality
was used. Patients had to have blood tests performed
within 14 days of registration and/or before starting treatment. The following criteria were used for inclusion:
white blood cell count 3000/lL, absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) 1500/mm3, platelet count 100,000/
mm3, hemoglobin 10 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase <3.0 upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin <1.5 ULN, and creatinine <1.5
mg/dL. Patients were permitted on study if effusions or
fluid collections were drained before treatment. Effective
contraception was mandated while patients were on study,
and pregnancy or breast-feeding was exclusionary.
Patients could not be on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs and had to be able to take steroids, B12, and folic
acid. Patients could not have significant medical illnesses
or infection that could not be adequately controlled with
appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient’s
ability to tolerate this treatment. Prior malignancies were
okay if in complete remission and the patient had been off
all therapy for a minimum of 3 years, except nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
Patients were treated with pemetrexed at a dose of
900 mg/m2 intravenously over 10 minutes every 3 weeks;
1 cycle was 6 weeks. This dose was arbitrarily chosen by
using the maximum tolerated dose from a single-agent

phase 1 trial, which was 1200 g/m2,16 and the theory that
if pemetrexed was like methotrexate in its ability to penetrate the CNS, then higher than standard doses (500 mg/
m2) may be needed. In addition, preclinical data suggested limited penetration into the CNS,17 so we wanted
to try and optimize CNS penetration.
Patients were required to take 1 mg folic acid daily
and vitamin B12 (1000 lg as an intramuscular injection
every 9 weeks) starting 5 days before the first dose of
pemetrexed and continuing until 21 days after the last
dose. Patients not on dexamethasone received 4 mg orally
twice a day the day before, the day of, and the day after
pemetrexed treatment. The use of B12, folic acid, and
dexamethasone was per package insert guidelines and to
reduce toxicities related to pemetrexed. Patients remained
on treatment as long as there was no evidence of tumor
progression or intolerable side effects and a complete
response (CR) was not achieved. Patients who had a CR
could receive up to 2 more additional doses. The trial was
modified to allow pemetrexed failures who initially
responded to be re-treated.
Within 14 days before beginning treatment all
patients were required to have a complete history and
neurologic examination, electrocardiography, standard
eligibility laboratory data and serum pregnancy test for
women of childbearing potential, and contrast enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord and to be on a stable dose of steroids for 5 days if
they were on steroids. While on therapy, a neurologic
examination and contrast enhanced MRI of the affected
area were performed approximately every 6 weeks. Blood
counts were performed weekly, and electrolytes with
blood urea nitrogen/creatinine were done within 48 hours
of each pemetrexed dose.
Treatment could be delayed for up to 21 days for
grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and if there was no recovery the
patient was removed from the trial. If treatment was
resumed, the dose was lowered by 25% for a platelet count
of 50,000/mm3 but ANC <500/mm3 and by 50% if
platelets were <50,000/mm3 with an ANC nadir of <100/
mm3. For diarrhea requiring hospitalization (or of at least
grade 3) and other grade 3 nonhematologic effects
(except transaminase elevations, nausea, or vomiting),
treatment was delayed until grade was 1. For grade 3 or 4
nonhematologic toxicities, the dose was reduced by 50%.
Statistical Methods
The activity of pemetrexed in the patients with recurrent
PCSNL was done in a small cohort of patients (goal 10-

12) to assess for antitumor activity. Response assessment
was per the Macdonald Criteria18 as CR, partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD).
Because not all patients had brain, eye, and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) evaluation at relapse, the International
Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group response
criteria were not used. PFS-6, median PFS, and OS were
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit curve.

RESULTS
Eleven patients (8 men and 3 women) with a median age
of 69.8 years (range, 40-82 years) were enrolled between
April 13, 2006 and February 17, 2009; median KPS was
70% (range, 60%-100%) (Table 1). All patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma except 1 each who had lowgrade histology and primary CNS T-cell lymphoma; all
patients had only brain disease at recurrence with prior
therapies listed in Table 1. All patients had complete neuraxis imaging; lumbar puncture; computed tomography
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; slit lamp examination;
bone marrow biopsy; and human immunodeficiency test
at initial presentation confirming the diagnosis of
PCSNL. At recurrence, 8 patients had brain only imaging,
and 3 had brain, spine, and CSF evaluation. Number of
prior treatments was 1 in 6 patients, 2 in 2 patients, 3 in 2
patients, and 5 in 1 patient; 2 patients had a prior stem
cell transplant. Median time from initial PCNSL diagnosis to pemetrexed treatment was 31 months (range, 4-96
months). The median number of treatment cycles was 5.1-7
Median follow-up of the 11 patients was 10.1 months
(range, 1.5-46.2 months). Before starting pemetrexed, 3
patients were on steroids, and 2 were could be weaned from
them; the remainder of patients only received steroids as
part of treatment. Response was as follows: 4 CR, 2 PR, 4
SD, and 1 PD for an overall response rate (CR þ PR) of
55% (CR rate of 36%) and a disease control rate (CR þ
PR þ SD) of 91%. One patient was re-treated twice for
recurrences, attaining a CR and a PR before stopping treatment because of overall clinical decline.
The PFS-6 and PFS-12 were 45% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 16%-74%) and 27% (95% CI, 20%-70%),
respectively, with a median PFS of 5.7 months (95% CI,
1.6-21.4 months; Fig. 1). The median OS was 10.1
months (95% CI, 2.4-33.3 months), with an OS-12 of
45% (95% CI, 16%-74%; Fig. 2). Reason for trial discontinuation was completion of treatment in 3 patients (1

jirovecii pneumonia only 1 of whom was on steroids (neither was on prophylaxis; both had PD on imaging), 1
with cellulitis, and 1 with clinical decline in the setting of
grade 2 thrombocytopenia; and death in 1 of unknown
cause. One patient with SD withdrew from the trial. Only
the patient with a low-grade central nervous system lymphoma remains alive; the other died of PCNSL (5
patients), pneumonia and associated pulmonary complications (2 patients), infection/gastrointestinal perforation
(1 patient), and unknown cause (2 patients lost to followup).
At progression, 6 patients had no further treatment,
1 patient had radiosurgery to a cerebellar lesion, 3 patients
received further salvage chemotherapy, and 1 patient was
lost to follow-up.
Toxicities seen while on trial are listed in Table 2.
The most common adverse events were hematologic, and
the most severe where pneumonia, combined in 1 patient
with neutropenia. Only 1 patient required a dose reduction for hematologic toxicity, and 1 patient was unable to
restart because of a grade 3 thrombocytopenia that did
not resolve before the patient was removed from the trial
because of clinical deterioration.

DISCUSSION
This is the first report of using pemetrexed in PCNSL.
Our objective was to assess the efficacy of pemetrexed in
relapsed/refractory PCNSL patients, as there remains a
significant need for effective salvage therapies in this
patient population. Pemetrexed’s similarity to methotrexate but ability to target >1 aspect of folate metabolism led
us to hypothesize that this agent might also be active in
PCNSL. Clinical activity was seen with an overall
response rate of 55% and a disease control rate of 91%.
The interval of disease controlled was variable but durable
in some cases. Importantly, responses occurred in patients
who had failed prior HD methotrexate, suggesting that
methotrexate exposure does not preclude a response from
pemetrexed. In addition, responses were seen in patients
who failed multiple prior treatments, including prior autologous stem cell transplantation. All patients received
dexamethasone during their treatment, which we
acknowledge may have contributed to the response rates,
but this was needed to minimize systemic toxicities.
Our PFS-6 was 45%, median PFS was 5.7 months,
and median OS was 10.1 months; this is comparable to
other chemotherapeutic agents used in the relapsed/refractory PCNSL setting.11-14,19-21 Plotkin et al14 reported

PCNSL with temozolomide and rituximab; they had a
100% response rate, with median response duration of 6
months and OS of 8 months. Enting et al12 treated 15
patients with refractory PCNSL with rituximab and
temozolomide; their response rate was 53%. The median
PFS for all patients was 2.2 months but 7.7 months for
complete responders; median OS was 14 months. Batchelor et al23 recently published data in 12 patients treated
with rituximab after failing HD methotrexate. They
reported a 36% response rate, with a median PFS of
almost 2 months and OS of 20.9 months.
Two additional studies used intensive multiagent
chemotherapy, which had higher morbidity than singleagent trials, as well as several treatment-related deaths.
Arellano-Rodrigo et al20 treated 16 patients with recurrent PCNSL with etoposide, ifosfamide, and cytarabine.
The response rate was 37% (6 CRs), with a PFS of 4
months, PFS-12 of 22%, and OS-12 of 41%. Soussain et
al24 treated 22 patients with refractory or relapsed PCNSL
with HD cytarabine and etoposide and then transplanted
with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide. After
this regimen, 16 patients entered CR, and 2 remained in
PR; the 3-year probability of survival and event-free
survival was 60% and 53%.
The toxicities seen in our patients were higher than
expected and in some cases severe, which may be a result
of using a higher than standard dose (900 mg/m2 vs 500
mg/m2) and their degree of prior therapy. The dose

3747

Original Article

chosen was empiric but increased over the standard dose
to increase CNS penetration. The increased toxicity may
have been less if the standard dose was used.
Our results with single-agent pemetrexed in
relapsed/refractory PCNSL are not dissimilar from other
salvage regimens, given the differences in patient populations. Despite minimal CSF penetration in an animal
model, antitumor activity occurs in patients. In a separate
trial, we measured CSF and plasma in patients treated
with pemetrexed and found that the levels were 1% to 3%
of plasma (manuscript in preparation); tumor penetration
likely occurs from a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier
leading to tumoricidal levels of drug. Furthermore, this
agent is relatively easy to administer in the outpatient setting, unlike methotrexate, which requires hospitalization
for continuous hydration. Continued investigation of this
agent, or other multitargeted antifolates, in a more homogeneous population, either alone or in combination, for
PCNSL is warranted to determine an optimal dose with
less toxicity and also true efficacy.
