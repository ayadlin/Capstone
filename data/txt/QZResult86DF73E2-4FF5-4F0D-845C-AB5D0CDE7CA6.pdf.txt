BACKGROUND: Current literature suggests that racial/ethnic minority survivors may be more likely than whites to experience economic hardship after a cancer diagnosis; however, little is known about such hardship. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer (LC) and
colorectal cancer (CRC) participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium were surveyed
approximately 4 months (baseline) and 12 months (follow-up) after diagnosis. Economic hardship at follow-up was present if participants 1) indicated difficulty living on household income; and/or 2) for the following 2 months, anticipated experiencing hardships
(inadequate housing, food, or medical attention) or reducing living standards to the bare necessities of life. The authors tested
whether African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics were more likely than whites to experience economic hardship controlling for sex,
age, education, marital status, cancer stage, treatment, and economic status at baseline (income, prescription drug coverage).
RESULTS: Of 3432 survivors (39.7% with LC, 60.3% with CRC), 14% were AA, 7% were Hispanic, and 79% were white. AAs and Hispanics had lower education and income than whites. Approximately 68% of AAs, 58% of Hispanics, and 44.5% of whites reported economic hardship. In LC survivors, the Hispanic-white disparity was not significant in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, and the AA-white
disparity was explained by baseline economic status. In CRC survivors, the Hispanic-white disparity was explained by baseline economic status, and the AA-white disparity was not explained by the variables that were included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Economic hardship was evident in almost 1 in 2 cancer survivors 1 year after diagnosis, especially AAs. Research should evaluate and

INTRODUCTION
Among the side effects of cancer, financial toxicity is now recognized as an important sequela that cannot be overlooked in
a comprehensive approach to cancer care.1,2 Within a few months after diagnosis, as many as 40% of cancer patients worry
about the cost of their care.3,4 Cancer patients have higher out-of-pocket expenses for medical care compared with demographic counterparts who are not diagnosed with cancer.5-7 Such medical expenses are higher among survivors even when
they are no longer receiving acute cancer care.5-7 Furthermore, about 1 in 3 survivors report cancer-related financial problems for them or their family at some point after the cancer diagnosis.8 This financial toxicity may translate into longer
term economic hardship that leads survivors to lower their standards of living; to experience hardships like inadequate
housing, food, or medical attention; or, in general, to experience difficulty living on their income. A greater understanding
of economic hardship is imperative given its potential effects on delayed or forgone medical care8 and, consequently, on
disease and survivorship outcomes.
Although it potentially affects many cancer survivors, cancer economic hardship may not affect all survivors equally.
Those with lower incomes5,7,9,10 and of racial/ethnic minority background may be disproportionally burdened.10 In 1
study, racial/ethnic minority breast cancer survivors with low income spent a significantly higher proportion of that
income on cancer-related out-of-pocket expenses than their counterparts.10 Furthermore, minority survivors identified financial assistance for medical bills as 1 of their most pressing needs11 and were concerned about the long-term impact of
this financial toxicity, for example, on savings, on the ability to provide for other family needs, and on work.12 Moreover,
minority survivors were more likely to report cancer-related financial problems compared with their counterparts.8 Thus,

they may suffer the consequences of their disease in terms
of economic hardship more than nonminority survivors,
even further away from diagnosis.
The objective of this study was to examine the economic hardship experienced by racial/ethnic minority
cancer survivors compared with their majority counterparts 1 year after diagnosis. We used data from the Cancer
Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS)
Consortium, a multisite, population-based study that
combined data from surveys and from medical records
about disease and treatment and that oversampled racial/
ethnic minorities. These data provided an excellent opportunity to preliminarily examine economic hardship in
a multiethnic sample. In particular, we examined whether
African American and Hispanic survivors were more likely
than white survivors to report economic hardship while
accounting for factors that may affect this hardship and
differ across race/ethnicity, eg, disease, treatment, and
economic status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methods

The objective of the CanCORS Consortium, which was
established by the National Cancer Institute, was to gain a
better understanding of the reasons that underlie variations in cancer treatment and cancer outcomes.13 Beginning in 2003, patients with lung cancer or colorectal
cancer were identified through state cancer registries or
from health care systems in 5 large geographic areas, 5
Cancer Research Network integrated health systems, and
15 Veterans Administration hospitals. Participants were
surveyed approximately 4 months (baseline) and 1 year
(follow-up) after diagnosis. On average, between the baseline and follow-up surveys, there were 265 days for lung
cancer survivors and 297 days for colorectal cancer survivors. The surveys were conducted by trained telephone
interviewers using a questionnaire that included previously validated items and scales in addition to items that
were developed specifically for the study.14 This study was
approved by each institution’s institutional review board.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The
current analysis included CanCORS participants who
completed the full versions of both surveys and excluded
those who completed short surveys or whose surveys were
completed by surrogates. Clinical data were collected
from medical records.
The main outcome was self-reported economic
hardship, which was defined based on 3 questions that
were asked only at follow-up. Namely, it was a dichoto1258

mous variable equal to 1 if participants reported at least
some difficulty on the question, “How difficult is it for
you to live on your total household income right now?”
(response options: not at all difficult, somewhat difficult,
difficult or barely get by, very difficult, extremely difficult
or impossible); or if they reported at least just a little
anticipation on the question, “In the next 2 months, how
much do you anticipate that you and your family will experience hardships such as inadequate housing, food, or
medical attention?” (response options: not at all, just a little, moderately, a great deal); or if they reported at least
just a little anticipation on the question, “In the next 2
months, how much do you anticipate having to reduce
your standard of living to the bare necessities of life?”
(response options: not at all, just a little, moderately, a
great deal).
Race/ethnicity was assessed by first asking respondents whether they were Hispanic or Latino and then asking whether they were white, black, African American, or
of other race (Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native,
Native Hawaiian, other Pacific Islander, or other). In this
analysis, we classified and included Hispanics, whites
(non-Hispanics), and African Americans (non-Hispanic
blacks).
Statistical Analysis

For each cancer type, we reported differences in economic
hardship by race/ethnicity and tested the association
between race/ethnicity, economic hardship, and other variables that may affect economic hardship and act as confounders of the association of economic hardship and
race/ethnicity. These were factors that affect access to
medical or other care and, consequently, health care
costs15 or factors that affect survivors’ ability to maintain
economic well being. Specifically, we considered: 1) sociodemographic variables, ie, sex, age, education, marital
status; 2) stage of disease, treatment received before
follow-up (chemotherapy, radiation), and quality of life
(measured at baseline with the European Quality-of-Life
instrument [EQ-5D]16); and 3) economic status at baseline, ie, household income and the number of individuals
supported by that income, insurance coverage and coverage for prescription drugs (partial or full coverage), and
paid job and job changes since baseline (ie, having a paid
job at baseline and not at follow-up). We used chi-square
(or, when needed, Fisher exact) 2-tailed tests with a significance level of 5%.
We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses17 adjusting for factors that were associated significantly with race/ethnic group. We did not include factors

that themselves could be considered indicators of economic hardship, such as job changes. Moreover, because
of considerations regarding multicollinearity, insurance
coverage and paid job at baseline also were not included.
Variables were included sequentially in blocks starting
with sociodemographics. Given the relations between
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic variables, we tested for,
but did not observe, statistically significant interactions
between race/ethnicity and income and education. We
estimated full models with all variables included, and
reduced models that included race/ethnicity and variables
that were identified as statistically significant in the full
model. Model goodness of fit was assessed with the
Hosmer-Lemeshow test.17 Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Statistical significance was declared where the CI did not include the value
1. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Among the 1364 lung cancer survivors, 83.1% were
white, 12.2% were African American, and 4.8% were Hispanic. Among the 2068 colorectal cancer survivors,
76.3% were white, 15.2% were African American, and
8.4% were Hispanic (Table 1). There were significant differences across race/ethnicity in demographics; for example, age and marital status. There were no racial/ethnic
differences in stage of disease, but there were some differences in treatment: African American survivors were more
likely to receive radiation for lung cancer, and African
American and Hispanic survivors were more likely to
receive chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, than white
survivors. Furthermore, quality-of-life scores were similar
across racial/ethnic groups, although they were lower for
lung cancer survivors than for colorectal cancer survivors.
Only a few survivors were uninsured, but a larger proportion did not have coverage for prescription drugs, with

For this variable, there was a significant difference across minority status for lung cancer survivors (P <.05).
b
For this variable, there was a significant difference across minority status for colorectal cancer survivors (P <.05.)

African Americans and Hispanics less likely to have coverage. Similarly, African Americans and Hispanics had
lower incomes with more individuals supported on that
income at baseline, and they were more likely to have
experienced job changes since baseline.
Economic hardship was reported by 52.7% of lung
cancer survivors and by 46.1% of colorectal cancer survivors, and a higher proportion of African American and
Hispanic survivors reported economic hardship than
white survivors (Table 2). Approximately 68% of African
American survivors and 58% of Hispanic survivors
reported economic hardship across the 2 cancer types,
whereas 50% of white lung cancer survivors and 40.5% of
white colorectal cancer survivors reported such hardship.
From 14.7% to 19.2% of African Americans and from
13.4% to 16.9% of Hispanics reported that it was very
difficult or extremely difficult to live on their income
compared with 4.8% to 7.6% of whites. Similarly, African
American and Hispanic survivors more frequently
reported at least some level of anticipated hardship or
reduction in living standards.
In adjusted analyses for lung cancer survivors, the
full and reduced models had good model fit (HosmerLemeshow test, P 5 .71 and P 5 .34, respectively) (Table
3). The association between economic hardship and race/
ethnicity was not significant: the adjusted OR was 1.21
1260

(95% CI, 0.79-1.84) for African Americans and 1.48
(95% CI, 0.73-2.54) for Hispanics. The association with
African American race became nonsignificant when we
adjusted for baseline economic status, whereas the association with Hispanic ethnicity was not significant in unadjusted analyses. In adjusted analyses for colorectal cancer
survivors, the full and reduced models both had good
model fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P 5 .49 and P 5 .92,
respectively). Economic hardship retained a significant
association with African American race when adjusting
for all factors, with African Americans having higher odds
of economic hardship than whites (adjusted OR, 1.69;
95% CI, 1.24-2.30). Economic hardship was not significantly associated with Hispanic ethnicity after adjusting
for economic status (adjusted OR in full model, 1.35;
95% CI, 0.90-2.03). Overall, education, marital status,
disease characteristics, and the receipt of chemotherapy
or radiation therapy were not significantly associated
with economic hardship. Lack of prescription drug coverage and lower income were associated with higher
odds of economic hardship (Table 3).

hardship, ie, having difficulty living on total household
income, or anticipated hardships like inadequate housing,
food, or medical attention and/or reductions in living
standards to the bare necessities of life. Hardship was
more frequently reported by African Americans and Hispanics. Some, but not all, of the observed disparities were
explained by differences in economic status. Moreover,
treatment type and disease stage were not associated with
economic hardship. These results suggest that economic
hardship may not be caused by cancer care costs alone.
The burden of the cost of care is now considered an
additional side effect of cancer and its treatment.1 In a

sample of patients with stage III colon cancer, 38%
reported accruing debt, selling or refinancing a home,
borrowing money from friends or family, or experiencing
a decline 20% in annual income as a result of treatmentrelated expenses.18 Among patients from academic and
community hospitals, 30% reported concerns about paying for cancer care, 22% reported their families had to
make sacrifices, and 17% were concerned about the coverage of costs past the initial cancer care treatment period.4
This concern about long-term finances is legitimate: our
findings indicate that almost 50% of survivors experienced economic hardship about 1 year after diagnosis.

Similarly, among respondents to the National Health
Interview Survey, mostly 1 year or more after the cancer
diagnosis, approximately 33% reported having experienced cancer-related financial problems.8 The consequences of these hardships are tangible. Survivors who reported
cancer-related financial problems were more likely to
report foregoing or delaying medical care, including medications.8 Among patients who applied for copayment assistance, >20% had cut down on or had not filled drug
prescriptions, almost 50% had used savings, and the same
proportion had reduced spending on food or clothing.19
Among cancer survivors responding to an internet survey,
approximately 9% (but 25% of those with lower incomes)
reported deciding not to have recommended care because
of costs, and approximately 20% reported a large amount
of distress related to medical care costs.20 Investigators are
also starting to examine the consequences of economic
hardships on the emotional well being and general quality
of life of survivors.21-24
Our results are generally consistent with current literature indicating that racial/ethnic minority survivors,
who represent about 20% of US survivors,25 are more
likely to experience some economic hardship.8,26 We
observed that approximately 66% of African American
survivors and >50% of Hispanic survivors reported economic hardship, regardless of which cancer they had,
compared with 50% of white survivors. The disparity
among lung cancer survivors was not significant once participants’ economic status was considered, and it was less
than that observed among colorectal cancer survivors.
This may be explained by the finding that white lung cancer survivors had lower incomes compared with white
colorectal cancer survivors, a factor that was associated significantly with a higher likelihood of economic hardship.
The observed disparity between African American and
white colorectal cancer survivors was not explained by
economic status or the factors included in our analysis.
However, we note that, although African American colorectal cancer survivors were more likely than their white
counterparts to have a paid job at diagnosis, they also were
more likely to have job changes since diagnosis, possibly
indicating challenges related to returning to work after the
diagnosis. This is in line with other reports of disparities
in work-related outcomes after breast cancer.27-29 Furthermore, it is reported that African American and Hispanic workers have lower levels of net worth and are less
likely to have white-collar jobs that would offer benefits
like sick leave and work schedule flexibility, all of which
are very helpful during cancer recovery.30 Therefore,
events related to differences in jobs and earnings postdiag1262

nosis may be contributing to the observed racial/ethnic
disparity in economic hardship and should be further
examined.
Others have reported that a history of chemotherapy
or radiation was associated with cancer-related financial
problems or with a greater perceived impact of medical
costs, especially chemotherapy.8,31 We observed that
treatment was not significantly associated with economic
hardship 1 year after diagnosis. This suggests that other
expenses to maintain or improve quality of life, rather
than expenses for the treatment itself, may be making a
difference for survivors in the months after treatment.
Not having prescription drug coverage was significantly
associated with economic hardship, reinforcing the finding that not being able to pay for drugs other than chemotherapy may also have an important impact on economic
hardship. This is in line with previous studies reporting
that survivors’ expenses in the years after diagnosis
remained higher than those of individuals who never had
cancer.5-7 Moreover, as expected, having a lower income
was associated with economic hardship, in line with other
reports on the association of low income with a greater
perceived impact of medical costs and a large amount of
distress related to medical care expenses.20,31
This secondary data analysis had limitations. First,
economic hardship questions were not asked at baseline;
therefore, although we controlled for survivors’ economic
status at baseline, we cannot exclude the possibility that
the economic hardship also existed at baseline. Moreover,
baseline in this study corresponded to a mean of 4 months
after cancer diagnosis; thus, it was not a true baseline
reflecting the participants’ status at the time of diagnosis.
Second, although CanCORS participants are representative of the SEER cancer patient population in age, sex,
and disease stage,32 we do not know whether the participants who were included in this analysis were representative of the general lung cancer and colorectal cancer
survivor population 1 year after diagnosis. Moreover, survivors with the worst economic hardship may have been
those in poorer health33 who were more likely to drop out
or die before the follow-up survey. In this case, the
reported prevalence of economic hardship may be underestimated. Third, we only examined a population of cancer survivors; therefore, we cannot be certain that
economic hardship is caused by cancer or whether the
same hardship is experienced by individuals with other
severe conditions. However, other studies have demonstrated that the risk of having high out-of-pocket
expenses, for example, was higher for individuals who had
cancer versus those with or without other chronic

diseases.26 Fourth, we strived for a much larger representation of ethnic minorities; however, our minority representation reached a respectable 17%.
Despite some limitations, our study represents 1 of
only a few investigations on economic hardship in a large,
population-based, multiethnic sample that includes not
only African Americans but also Hispanics, Asians, and
other groups (although we did not include other minorities because of small numbers). This analysis makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the
challenges faced by diverse survivors along the survivorship continuum, and it provides a picture of some of the
trade-offs faced by survivors, regardless of disease severity
or cancer treatment received. In particular, survivors not
only are at risk of foregoing medical care8 but also may be
at risk of foregoing basic necessities like food and housing.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that economic
hardship in cancer survivors is frequently reported 1 year after diagnosis, especially among African Americans and Hispanics. Thus, the economic consequences of cancer may
not be limited to the intense treatment phase but may lead
to a longer term economic hardship that needs to be recognized and addressed in the growing survivor population.34
Considering that those with lower incomes at diagnosis are
more likely to report such hardship later in the survivorship
phase, long-term economic hardship should be addressed
early after diagnosis, and appropriate support should be
offered to reduce its prevalence. Such support may include
interventions to provide drug coverage and financial counseling or to facilitate the individual’s return to a stable
working status. Failure to address economic hardship is no
longer an option, because this may put survivors at higher
risks of distress, foregoing or delaying medical care, and
generally poorer outcomes and quality of life. It is also important to continue investigating the disparities in workrelated outcomes and how to facilitate return to work, especially among African American survivors.
