BACKGROUND. Thromboembolic events (TEEs) are considered common in
patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma, but their frequency at baseline and
during chemotherapy is not known. Because prophylactic anticoagulation results
in improved overall survival (OS) of solid tumor patients, the authors hypothesized that TEEs at baseline and during chemotherapy would have an adverse
effect on OS.

a taxane, camptothecin, platinum, or fluoropyrimidine. At baseline, TEEs
occurred in 5.3% of untreated patients compared with 8.5% of previously treated
OS was only 3.9 months for patients who had a TEE at any time versus 8.7
months for patients who never developed a TEE (P ¼ .007). TEEs at baseline were
correlated with poor median OS in untreated patients (4.9 months vs 8.9 months
for patients without a TEE; P ¼ .014). There was no associated between TEEs and
the type of chemotherapy used.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results established that TEEs at baseline and/or during chemotherapy are frequent and result in poor OS for patients with advanced
gastroesophageal carcinoma. Aggressive methods to treat or prevent TEEs are
warranted. Cancer 2007;109:1989–95.  2007 American Cancer Society.

he association between thrombosis and malignancy was
reported first in 1865 by Trousseau1 and now is documented
well in the medical literature.2–4 Gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer often is associated with a high incidence of thromboembolic events (TEEs). In a review of >1 million Medicare patients
who were admitted with a diagnosis of malignancy, gastric cancer
had the fifth highest rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): only lymphoma and cancers of the pancreas,
brain, and ovaries with higher rates.2 It is known that, if diagnoses
of cancer and TEE are made simultaneously or close together, then
patients often have more advanced-stage cancer and a poor prognosis.4 It also has been demonstrated that chemotherapy can increase

the risk of TEEs in cancer patients; however, those
data generally were limited to patients with breast
cancer who received biologic and cytotoxic agents.5–7
The rate of baseline TEEs and their development
during systemic chemotherapy in patients with
advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma is not known.
In addition, to our knowledge, the impact of TEEs on
overall survival (OS) has not been documented in
this group of cancers. A closer focus on TEEs is even
more important, because a recent randomized study
of 302 patients with solid tumors demonstrated
a survival advantage for patients who received
treatment with prophylactic low-molecular-weight
heparin.8
Limited information on the association of TEEs
(venous and arterial) has been reported in patients
with advanced gastroesophageal cancer who were
receiving biochemotherapy (irinotecan, cisplatin, and
bevacizumab).9 In 24 patients, the rate of development of TEEs was 25% (95% confidence interval, 11–
45%) during therapy. The baseline rate of TEEs was
not an issue in that trial, because those patients were
ineligible, and the numbers were too small to assess
the impact of TEEs on OS.
We chose to study a large number of patients
with advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma who
were entering systemic chemotherapy clinical trials.
Therefore, patients were staged thoroughly and followed carefully. We hypothesized that, because prophylactic anticoagulation prolongs survival, the
presence TEEs at baseline or their development during protocol chemotherapy would have an adverse
impact on OS. To our knowledge, this is the first
analysis of TEEs at baseline and during chemotherapy and their relation to OS in patients with gastroesophageal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We evaluated 191 patients with advanced gastric or
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who participated in approved chemotherapy protocols at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
between August 1997 and September 2003. Patients
had a complete history and physical examination,
complete blood count, serum chemistry, and computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and
pelvis. A CT scan of the chest was obtained when it
was indicated clinically (examples include involvement of the lower esophagus, an abnormal chest radiograph, or pulmonary symptoms). Patients did not
have any uncontrolled comorbid conditions (uncontrolled diabetes, active angina or congestive heart

failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or an active psychiatric condition that would prevent participation
and compliance). All patients signed a written
informed-consent form and were enrolled into 1 of 4
consecutive clinical trials. Three trials evaluated
camptothecin-based chemotherapy (irinotecan, pegylated camptothecin, and rubitecan), and 1 trial investigated noncamptothecin-based chemotherapy. One
of the camptothecin-based trials was a combination
chemotherapy regimen with cisplatin and irinotecan,
and the other 2 trials examined single-agent pegylated-camptothecin and single-agent rubitecan. In
the noncamptothecin-based trial, patients received
combinations of cisplatin, docetaxel, and fluorouracil
as part of a Phase II/III trial.
All data and clinical events were collected prospectively and reported while patients were enrolled
on the clinical trial. During treatment, TEEs of the
extremities were confirmed by duplex ultrasonography or venography. PEs were confirmed by CT scans,
ventilation perfusion studies, or angiography. CT
scanning or angiography was used to confirm the
presence of intraabdominal TEEs and coronary artery
thrombi. Events were categorized as DVT of the
extremities, PE, cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, or intraabdominal TEE. The anatomic
location of thrombi or emboli was recorded, and all
events were graded based on the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0).10 Events that occurred in
patients who had not received any treatment for
metastatic disease were used to determine the baseline incidence of TEEs in untreated patients. In treated patients (who received 1 prior chemotherapy
regimen for metastatic disease), TEEs prior to the
protocol chemotherapy were used as the baseline.
TEEs that occurred after the initiation of the protocol
chemotherapy and within 60 days of the last dose of
chemotherapy were classified as treatment-related
TEEs. TEEs that occurred within the immediate postoperative period (within 60 days of surgery) or
thrombosis of central venous catheters were
excluded from the study, because they could be attributable to causes other than malignancy or chemotherapy. Superficial thrombophlebitis, transient
ischemic attacks, and thrombosis that occurred in
the setting of disseminated intravascular coagulation
were not included in the study. OS was calculated
from the date protocol chemotherapy was initiated.
Time points until death or last follow-up were determined by chart review or by using the Social Security
Death Index. This analysis was approved by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.

Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient
characteristics. Methods such as the 2-sided chisquare test and the Fisher exact test were used to
determine differences in the incidence of TEEs
between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used
to estimate survival, and Mantel-Cox log-rank tests
were used to test differences in survival distribution.
Data from patients who remained alive at the time of
the analysis were censored. All statistical analyses
were 2-sided and performed at a significance level of
.05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Prospectively collected data on 191 patients was rereviewed for the purpose of this analysis. Table 1 presents the age, sex, primary tumor location, tumor
histology, and history of prior chemotherapy for all
patients at the time of enrollment. With the exception of prior treatment, all 4 protocols had similar
criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Age, sex, histology, and location of the primary tumor did not differ significantly between patients with and without TEEs diagnosed at baseline or during protocol
chemotherapy.

TEEs
The incidence of TEEs at baseline for all patients was
6.3%. In untreated patients, the baseline incidence of
TEEs was 5.3% compared with 8.5% in treated
patients (P ¼ .519). During the receipt of protocol
chemotherapy, TEEs were observed in 7.9% of
patients overall. TEEs were observed in 6.8% of
untreated patients during protocol chemotherapy
and in 10.2% of treated patients during protocol
chemotherapy (P ¼ .561). When untreated patients
received a camptothecin-based chemotherapy regimen, 6.5% had a treatment-related TEE. TEEs were
observed in 7.3% of untreated patients who received
noncamptothecin-based chemotherapy. In untreated
patients, the chemotherapy regimen with the lowest
treated-related incidence of TEEs was the combination chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin and irinotecan (2.6%). In treated patients, the percentage of
TEEs increased to 13.8% in patients who received
cisplatin and irinotecan (P ¼ .158). The highest incidence of treatment-related TEEs in untreated
patients was observed in patients who received rubitecan (15.0%). The incidence of TEEs at baseline or
during treatment was not statistically different
between any of the different chemotherapy groups
(Table 2).

Twenty-six of 191 patients (13.6%) had a TEE
documented either at baseline or during protocol
chemotherapy. Twelve patients (6.3%) had a TEE
diagnosed prior to the start of protocol chemotherapy; and, of those 12 patients, only 1 patient had a
recurrent TEE diagnosed during chemotherapy. That
patient had an asymptomatic intraabdominal TEE
diagnosed prior to chemotherapy and later developed a DVT. DVT of the extremities was the most frequent and accounted for 47.1% of TEEs during
chemotherapy. None of the patients who had DVT
had a PE diagnosed concurrently. However, 1 patient
with DVT had a concurrent portal vein thrombosis.
PE was observed in 4 patients on protocol chemotherapy. One event resulted in death, and 1 patient
had a portal and splenic vein thrombosis diagnosed
concurrently (Table 3).

TEE and OS
The median OS for all 191 patients was 8.3 months.
Two patients remained alive >24 months after the
completion of protocol chemotherapy. In patients
who had a TEE diagnosed at baseline or during treatment, the median OS was only 3.9 months compared
with 8.7 months for patients who did not have a TEE
(P ¼ .007) (Fig. 1). In a subgroup analysis, the difference in median OS remained significant for
untreated patients who had a TEE at baseline or during chemotherapy compared with patients who did
not have a TEE (6.6 months vs 9 months; P ¼ .025).
The survival difference did not reach statistical significance for treated patients (most likely because of
the small number of patients in this group).
At baseline, patients who had a TEE had a median OS of only 3 months compared with a median
OS of 8.4 months for patients who did not have a
TEE (P ¼ .042). In untreated patients who had a TEE
at baseline, the median OS was 5 months compared
with 8.9 months in patients who did not have a TEE
(P ¼ .014) (Fig. 2). In previously treated patients, a
difference in OS was not observed between patients

who had a TEE prior to protocol chemotherapy and
patients who did not have a TEE prior to protocol
chemotherapy. Again, the lack of significance may
have been caused by the small number of patients in
this group.
Patients who had a TEE diagnosed during chemotherapy had a median survival of 4.8 months compared with 8.5 months in patients who did not have
a TEE during chemotherapy (P ¼ .078) (Fig. 3).
Untreated patients who developed a TEE during protocol chemotherapy had a median OS of 6.7 months
compared with a median OS of 9 months in patients
who did not develop a TEE during chemotherapy
(P ¼ .269). In treated patients who had a TEE during
protocol chemotherapy, the median OS was 3.7
months compared with 6.3 months in patients who
did not have a TEE during chemotherapy (P ¼ .168).

DISCUSSION
It is understood generally that gastroesophageal carcinomas are associated with a high rate of thrombosis. However, the largest studies of cancer and
thrombosis are limited to Medicare database reviews
of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of
cancer and thrombosis.2,3 The clinical relevance of
this information is unclear. Furthermore, there have
been scarce data regarding the incidence of TEEs in
patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer
undergoing chemotherapy. In addition, to our knowledge, the impact of TEEs diagnosed at baseline or
during chemotherapy has not been reported in this
group of patients. Klerk et al.8 studied the effect of
low-molecular-weight heparin or placebo as prophylaxis in a randomized fashion in 302 patients with
solid tumors and excluded the patients who had a
baseline TEE. That intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS
(P ¼ .021) in favor of the group that received lowmolecular-weight heparin compared with the group
that received placebo. With this observation, our hypothesis that TEEs (at baseline or during chemotherapy) would have an adverse impact on OS is
strengthened further. Our data support the finding
TEEs at baseline or during chemotherapy result in
poorer OS for patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer who are receiving protocol chemotherapy
(P ¼ .007) (Fig. 1). In addition, our data demonstrate

the adverse impact of TEEs at baseline in untreated
patients (P ¼ .014) (Fig. 2) and of TEEs that develop
during protocol chemotherapy in both patient populations studied, although the impact was not statistically significant but did show a trend (P ¼ .078). The
adverse impact of TEEs at baseline in treated
patients did not reach statistical significance; however, this most likely was because of the small number of patients in this group.
Another issue related to the development of TEE
is that of chemotherapy agents. Irinotecan, which is
a semisynthetic analogue, has been associated with
fatal TEEs.11 In addition, it has been demonstrated
that biotherapy, such as bevacizumab, has a higher
incidence of arterial TEEs. In a pooled analysis of 5
randomized, controlled trials, arterial TEEs were
more common in the 963 patients who received bevacizumab and chemotherapy compared with the 782
patients who received chemotherapy alone (4.4% vs
1.9%; P < .01).12 In the current analysis, untreated
patients who received cisplatin and irinotecan had
rates of TEE similar to those in patients who received
other agents. Our data on all patients who received
any of the camptothecins also suggest that the incidence of TEE was not increased compared with the
incidence in patients who received other classes of
agents. Because agents such as bevacizumab are
more likely to be used in future investigations, our
data on the development of TEEs with chemotherapy
alone provide a baseline that has not been available
previously.
Why TEEs result in poor survival needs to be
pondered. There is no clear answer available at the
moment. It has been reported that patients with can-

CANCER

cer diagnosed at the time of venous thromboembolism or within 1 year more often have metastatic disease and a lower survival rate than patients without
venous thromboembolism.4 TEEs may be related to
or manifestations of aggressive cancer biology (metastatic potential) while imparting morbidity of their
own. However, further research in this area to
include consideration for prophylactic anticoagulation for protocol patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer is needed. A well-designed clinical
trial would randomize patients to treatment with
low-molecular-weight heparin or placebo for a
defined period. Survival would be the primary endpoint, and the study would be powered to detect a
clinically relevant difference in survival. Correlative
and translational studies would be completed to
investigate the impact of biochemotherapy, tumor
biology, and patient genetics. The concerns regarding
morbidity from prophylactic anticoagulation are
legitimate; because, in the study by Klerk et al., a
higher rate of bleeding was reported in the treatment
group than in the placebo group.8 Secondary endpoints would have to include the incidence of TEE,
bleeding complications, patient compliance, and
quality of life. Currently, prophylactic anticoagulation
remains controversial, and further studies are needed
to direct the development of treatment guidelines.
To decrease the probability of overtreating
patients with anticoagulation, it is possible that,
before starting chemotherapy, patients with a TEE
could be selected for prolonged anticoagulation therapy based on D-dimer assays. Palareti et al. conducted a study of 627 patients with a history of
idiopathic venous thromboembolism who had been
treated previously for at least 3 months with a vitamin K antagonist.13 Patients with abnormal D-dimer
assays were assigned randomly to resume or discontinue treatment. Patients with normal D-dimer levels
did not resume anticoagulation. In patients who had
abnormal D-dimer levels, the incidence of recurrent
thromboembolism was reduced by resuming anticoagulation (hazard ratio, 4.26; 95% confidence interval,
1.23–14.6; P ¼ .02). The utility of D-dimer assays
needs to be studied in a population of cancer
patients to assess the need and potential benefit of
prolonged anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight
heparin.
We studied only those patients who were participating on approved chemotherapy protocols; thus,
the data reported here were collected prospectively.
The patients were staged thoroughly and observed
closely, and no patients were excluded from the analysis. We acknowledge that a limitation to this study
was the lack of a suitable control group. However, it

would be difficult to find a control group of patients
with advanced gastroesophageal cancer who are eligible for protocol chemotherapy and could be
assigned to observation. Another consideration is the
evolving imaging technology, which may detect an
unsuspected TEE. Most of the TEEs in our report
were DVTs, and very few were PEs. Nevertheless, the
impact of improved imaging could not be addressed
in our study or in any study with an observation/
recruitment span >2 years. In patients with gastroesophageal cancers, CT scans of the chest are
obtained only when they are indicated clinically;
and, in our study, chest CT scans were obtained in
56.5% of patients. If all patients had routine CT scans
of the chest, then the results may have been different; however, considering the low frequency of confirmed PEs in our study, we do not believe that the
difference would have been substantial.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this report presents the first data that demonstrate the frequency of
TEEs at baseline and during chemotherapy in
patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer who
were enrolled on protocol chemotherapy. In addition,
the diagnosis of a TEE (at baseline or during chemotherapy) had an adverse impact on OS. Further
research is warranted on methods to include aggressive therapy for TEEs and their prevention to
improve the survival of patients with advanced gastroesophageal carcinoma.
