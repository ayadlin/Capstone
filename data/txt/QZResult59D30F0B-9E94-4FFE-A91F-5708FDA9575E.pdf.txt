BACKGROUND: Methadone is an effective and inexpensive opioid for cancer pain treatment. It has been reported as
difficult to use in the outpatient setting because of its variable relative potency and long half-life. The purpose of this
study was to determine the outcome of methadone initiation or rotation for cancer pain treatment in outpatient settings. METHODS: Chart review was done of 189 consecutive patients who underwent methadone initiation or rotation
at the authors’ palliative care outpatient center. Data were collected regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, symptoms, and opioid side effects at baseline and for 2 follow-up visits (F1, F2). Failure was defined as methadone discontinuation by the palliative care physician or patient’s hospitalization for uncontrolled pain or methadonerelated side effects at F1. RESULTS: One hundred (53%) initiations and 89 (47%) rotations were conducted. Success
rates for methadone initiation and rotation were 82 of 89 (92%) and 85 of 100 (84%), respectively. Mean (standard
deviation) age was 60 (11) years. One hundred (53%) patients were women, 138 (73%) were white, and 182 (96%) had
solid cancers. The main reason for rotation was pain (65 of 89 patients, 47%). Median (interquartile range, IQR) pain
scores (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale/0-10) were 6 (5-8), 4 (3-6), and 3 (2-5) at baseline, F1, and F2,
respectively (P < .0001). Median (IQR) daily methadone dose for initiation and rotation was 10 (5-15) mg and 15 (1030) mg at F1 (P < .0001) and 10 (8-15) mg and 18 (10-30) mg at F2 (P < .0001), respectively. Constipation and nausea
improved (P < .005) after initiation/rotation to methadone. Frequency of sedation, hallucinations, myoclonus, and delirium did not increase after initiation/rotation to methadone. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient methadone initiation and
rotation for cancer pain treatment were safe, with high success rates and low side effect profiles. Cancer 2010;116:520–8.

Pain is extremely common in patients with advanced cancer, with prevalence as high as 80%. The vast majority of
patients with cancer pain require opioids for treatment.1,2 As a result of a major effort by various international groups, the
use of opioids has improved significantly, and patients now have earlier exposure to opioids, generally receive higher dosages, and are better managed than in the past.3 This highly desirable increase in the use of opioids, combined with
increased vigilance, has resulted in increased detection of several side effects. Side effects can range from constipation and
nausea to the more serious opioid-induced neurotoxicity, which includes delirium, seizures, and myoclonus. Opioid toxicity is caused by both the effect of the parent drug as well as by accumulation of opioid metabolites (eg, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucucoronide for morphine).4 Opioid rotation is required when there are intolerable side effects
despite good analgesia or inadequate pain control despite dose escalation.
Methadone is a synthetic drug that was developed after the Second World War as an alternative to morphine, having
a broad spectrum of suggested actions—l receptor agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, monoamine reuptake inhibitor, and a receptor agonist—and has been increasingly used as a second-line opioid in recent years in the management of cancer-related pain.5 It has complex pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties that make it difficult

to use. It is an ideal drug for opioid rotation because of its
efficacy, higher oral bioavailability, lack of known active
metabolites, incomplete cross tolerance with other l receptor agonists, and lower cost. Several prospective and
retrospective trials have demonstrated successful rotation
to methadone from other strong opioids in the setting of
intolerable side effects and inadequate analgesia despite
dose escalation.6-8 However, it has the disadvantages of
having a slow elimination phase (15-60 hours) and high
interindividual variation in the equianalgesic ratio with
other opioids, which have largely restricted methadone
use to experienced physicians in pain medicine.9
It is also a desirable alternative first-line strong
opioid particularly in developing countries, where cost is
an important consideration. There is growing preliminary
evidence supporting the use of methadone as a first-line
strong opioid.10,11 Largely, the use of methadone is limited by its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, such as the reported elimination
metabolism through cytochromes 3A4 and 2B6,12 the
participation of P-glycoprotein in the defense against central methadone intoxication,13 and concerns related to its
potential cardiotoxic effects (with prolongation of the QT
interval),14,15 which could impede its concomitant use
with specific drugs inhibiting the cited cytochromes or Pglycoprotein, or cause QT interval prolongation.
Unfortunately, there are few reports16,17 on the initiation and/or rotation of methadone in the outpatient
setting for cancer pain. The objective of this retrospective
study was to determine the efficacy and safety of methadone initiation (in strong opioid-naive patients) or rotation from another strong opioid in treating cancer-related
pain in an outpatient palliative care clinic at a comprehensive cancer center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board and was granted a waiver of informed consent. We reviewed the electronic charts of 189 consecutive
patients who were prescribed methadone for the first time
at the Palliative Care Outpatient Clinic at The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between April
2003 and March 2007.
Patients were included in the study if 1) they were
receiving methadone for the first time in the outpatient
setting and 2) the previous opioid was completely stopped
at the day of methadone initiation. Patients were excluded
of the study if they were 1) receiving opioids via intratheCancer

cal pump, 2) receiving opioids for reasons other than pain
(eg, dyspnea), or 3) admitted to the hospital after the initiation of methadone for reasons other than pain or methadone-related toxicities.
Strong opioid-naive patients were started on methadone as the first-line opioid when concerns regarding the
utilization of other opioids were present (ie, renal failure)
or when logistic issues were identified, such as the cost of
medications for patients with limited resources. Rotations
for pain were made by the palliative care specialist after
patients underwent multiple unsuccessful titrations with
the previous opioid agonist. Rotation usually was decided
on when the patient presented early signs or was considered at risk for dose-limiting side effects. Rotations
because of side effects took place when patients developed
severe opioid toxicity, such as delirium, myoclonus, and/
or sedation.
In our Palliative Care Outpatient Clinic, patients
were initiated on regular methadone at 5 mg twice a day,
with an additional prescription of rescue methadone,
according to minor modifications to procedures previously described by our group.10 In the context of opioid
rotation, we applied the usual strategy of variable morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone conversion ratios
according to the dose of previous opioid (5:1 when previous morphine equivalent daily dose 90 mg/d, 8:1 when
it was between 91 and 300 mg/d, and 12:1 when it was
301mg/d).18 These rotation ratios are modified by the
attending palliative care physician based on specific clinical characteristics. The most common modifier is the reason for rotation: patients being rotated because of severe
intractable pain were rotated to a lower morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone ratio as compared with patients
rotated because of opioid neurotoxicity.
Data were collected regarding patients’ demographics, diagnosis, current use of opioids (drug names
and total daily dose), date of methadone initiation, and
reason for rotation (if previously on opioids). Predictors
of poor response to opioid therapy such as presence of delirium, psychological distress, and neuropathic and incidental pain19 were also noted.
Symptoms (namely pain, nausea, and drowsiness)
were recorded for the first visit to the Palliative Care Outpatient Clinic and 2 consecutive follow ups using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), a widely
used and validated tool to assess 9 symptoms (pain, nausea, drowsiness, dyspnea, anxiety, depression, anorexia,
sleep, and fatigue) and general feeling of well-being in a 010 scale.20,21 Other opioid side effects, such as sedation,

521

Original Article

hallucinations, myoclonus, delirium, and constipation,
are routinely assessed in our Palliative Care Outpatient
Clinic and were considered present when reported by the
attending palliative care physician in the patient’s chart.
The total daily opioid dosage was calculated for the
first visit to the Palliative Care Outpatient Clinic and 2 consecutive follow-up visits by converting the total opioid dosage during 24 hours to an equivalent dose of oral morphine
(morphine equivalent daily dose), following standard equianalgesic conversion tables.22 The ratio between morphine
equivalent daily dose and methadone was calculated by
dividing the morphine equivalent daily dose previous to
rotation by the methadone daily dose at stable pain control
(defined as ESAS pain change 1 point or 30%).
Successful initiation/rotation to methadone was
evaluated at the first follow-up visit. Complete success of
methadone initiation or rotation was defined as 1)
improvement 30% or 2 points in the ESAS pain score
for strong opioid-naive patients who initiated methadone
because of pain or for patients who were rotated to methadone from other strong opioids for uncontrolled pain in
the absence of side effects; 2) reported evidence of disappearance of side effects at the first follow-up visit in the
cases in which the reason for methadone initiation was the
development of side effects with the previous strong
opioid; 3) improvement 30% or 2 points in the ESAS
pain score, with reported disappearance of side effects for
those patients rotated to methadone in the setting of
uncontrolled pain and dose-limiting side effects with the
previous opioid; and 4) reported evidence of resolution of
the logistical issue with the previous opioid (ie, resolution
of nonadherence related to financial burden as detected
and reported by the specialist palliative care physician as
the result of routinely performed adherence assessments),
with stable pain control. Methadone initiation or rotation
in the outpatient setting was considered a failure if the
drug was discontinued, if the patient was admitted to the
hospital because of pain or methadone-related side effects
on or before the first follow-up visit, or if the patient was
lost to follow-up. All cases that did not fall into the complete success or failure categories were considered partial
successes.
Data obtained from the second follow-up visit were
analyzed with regard to pain control and opioid side
effects.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
data. Chi-square tests were used to determine associations
between categorical variables. Differences between continuous variables were analyzed using t tests for normally dis-

522

tributed data and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for nonnormally distributed data. Significance <.05 were considered statistically significant. Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the association between
morphine equivalent daily dose of the previous opioid
and the morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone dose
ratio. To further identify factors associated with the morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone ratios at stable
pain control, we performed multivariate analyses of variance based on the ranks of the ratios, because these values
were not normally distributed. We performed these analyses first only including the variables found to be univariately associated with the ratios at significance levels <.20,
then deleted variables that were not statistically significant
(P < .05) 1 at a time from the multivariate model.

RESULTS
One hundred eighty-nine patients underwent methadone
initiation or rotation in the Palliative Care Outpatient
Clinic. Data collection is described in the flowchart in
Figure 1. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
There were no significant differences between groups.
By using a conservative intention-to-treat approach,
all 7 patients who did not have any follow-up visits were
considered failures. Reasons for rotation among these
cases are described in Table 2. Because of documentation
limitations, it was not possible to determine the reason for
rotation to methadone in 4 of 100 (4%) cases.
Median (interquartile range, IQR) time between
consultation and first follow-up visit was 13 (6-21) days,
and did not differ between initiation and rotation patients
(P ¼ .22). Median (IQR) time between first and second
follow-up visits was 8 (1-5) days for initiation patients
and 15 (10-25) days for rotation patients (P < .0001).
Median (IQR) time between baseline and second followup visit was 37 (23-60) days (P ¼ .59).
Median (IQR) morphine equivalent daily dose
before methadone initiation was 100 (60-185) mg/d.
The median (IQR) methadone dose at first follow-up
visit was 10 (5-15) mg/d for initiation patients and 15
(10-30) for rotation patients (P < .0001), and at second
follow-up visit it was 10 (8-15) mg/d for initiation
patients and 18 (10-30) mg/d for rotation patients (P <
.0001). Median dose increase between first and second
follow-up visits was 1.75 (0-5) mg (P < .0001) for initiation and 2.5 (0-10) mg for rotation patients (P ¼
.12). Considering previous reports of variable dose-dependent ratio for conversions from other opioids to

Results for both univariate and multivariate analyses are

Reasons for opioid rotation are described in Table 2.
Success (complete and partial) of methadone initiation after 1 follow-up visit occurred in 82 of 89 (92%) initiation
patients and in 85 of 100 (85%) rotation patients (P ¼
.2). Reasons for failure of the rotation to methadone were
nonimprovement/increase in pain in 12 of 15 (80%) cases
and appearance/persistence of side effects in 3 of 15
(20%) cases. For opioid naive patients initiating methadone, reasons for failure were nonimprovement of pain in
3 of 7 (43%) cases, nonadherence in 1 of 7 (14%) cases,
and appearance/persistency of side effects in 3 of 7 (43%)
cases.
There were 29 of 89 (35%) partial successes among
initiation patients between baseline and first follow-up visit.

524

Reasons for partial successes were pain in 21 of 29 (72%)
patients, nonadherence in 3 of 29 (10%) patients, and side
effects in 5 of 29 (17%) patients. Among rotation patients,
there were 38 of 85 (44%) partial successes between baseline
and first follow-up visit. In this group, reasons for partial
successes were pain in 28 of 38 (74%), nonadherence in 3
of 38 (9%), and side effects in 7 of 38 (18%) patients.
Data were available for 63 of 89 (70%) rotation and
63 of 93 (68%) initiation patients at the time of the second follow-up visit. At this time point, 53 of 63 (84%)
rotation and 59 of 61 (96%) initiation patients continued
receiving methadone (P ¼ .03).
ESAS pain scores improved in all groups, regardless
of their reason for initiation. Nausea and drowsiness were
also reduced in all groups, as summarized in Figure 3.
Sedation, hallucinations, myoclonus, delirium, and constipation, symptoms frequently related to opioid toxicity,
did not increase in frequency after methadone initiation/
rotation, as described in Figure 4.

DISCUSSION
Caution in the use of methadone in the outpatient setting
was previously recommended in several articles by our
group and others.27-30 We present the results of a retrospective chart review of 189 advanced cancer patients who
underwent initiation or rotation to methadone in an outpatient palliative care clinic. In the majority (88%) of the
patients, this strategy was successful. The use of methadone as a first-line opioid and especially in the outpatient
setting is still scarce, probably because of concerns about
the complex management of this drug and its side effects.9
In our study, 89 patients were started on methadone as
first strong opioid, and the overall success rate was of
92%. In a randomized study by Mercadante et al with
108 patients receiving slow-release morphine, fentanyl, or
methadone as initial strong opioid, no difference was

found between the 3 drugs regarding effectiveness, need
for coanalgesia, and safety. Methadone had the advantage
of lower cost; however, it required more dose titration,
prompting the authors to suggest that its use requires
more expertise in pain management compared with other
opioids.11 Our group has also reported in a randomized,
double-blind study of methadone versus morphine as
first-line opioid for the treatment of cancer pain that no

Cancer

difference was found regarding tolerability and analgesia
between the drugs.10
The use of methadone in the process of opioid rotation has been more extensively studied. In general, the
switch to methadone has been considered safe and effective. However, the majority of the studies were performed
in the inpatient setting.6,8,23,31-34 Our study shows that in
the context of opioid rotation, the use of methadone for
cancer-related pain in the outpatient setting is successful
(85% of the cases). Specifically, in the outpatient setting,
Hagen and Wasylenko reviewed 29 charts of patients with
cancer-related pain who underwent rotation to methadone in the outpatient setting and found that rotation to
methadone was successful in 17 (62%) patients within a
32-day average. The authors concluded that patients can
be safely and effectively rotated to methadone in the outpatient setting despite a long period to reach pain stability.16 Hernansanz et al reported success in 10 of 14 (71%)
cases in which opioid rotation was performed in the home
setting in advanced cancer patients.17 Our study builds on
this previous evidence, shedding light on the possibility of
safely using this drug in the outpatient setting.
After 2 follow-up visits, methadone was continued
in the majority of patients in our study, more frequently
among opioid-naive patients than in patients undergoing
opioid rotation. This is consistent with previous data
showing that the titration of methadone was easier in
patients who had not previously received opioids.35
Methadone used as first-line strong opioid in general resulted in improvement in pain and nausea, with

stable drowsiness. The improvement of pain is consistent
throughout studies of methadone rotation/initiation. In a
retrospective study of 196 patients who received methadone either as a first-line opioid (54%) or for opioid rotation from morphine (18%), only pain and insomnia
improved, and other symptoms such as drowsiness, constipation, and confusion worsened.36 The improvement
in nausea shown in the current study might be related to
advances in the interdisciplinary management of this
symptom. Delayed onset sedation was previously
described by our group in a study with 103 patients
randomized to either morphine or methadone as first-line
opioid, in which those who received methadone reported
more delayed onset sedation, with no difference in nausea,
constipation, or confusion.10
As observed in previous studies, patients who started
or rotated to methadone showed considerable reduction
in the frequency of constipation as reported by the attending
palliative care physician. This has been previously reported
and is postulated as being secondary to differences in methadone’s affinity for intestinal opioid receptors and also to
bowel withdrawal syndrome, because of the significantly
smaller doses of methadone needed to reach analgesia, binding to fewer intestinal opioid receptors as compared with
other opioids.8,37 Frequency of other symptoms related to
opioid toxicity such as myoclonus, delirium, hallucinations,

526

and sedation did not increase with methadone rotation;
however, it is not possible to positively conclude trends of
reduction because of the number of drop-offs between follow-up visits. Response to methadone when used for opioid
rotation has been attributed to an absence of circulating
metabolites as compared with other l agonists.18
It has been reported that methadone elimination
mostly occurs through cytochrome 3A4.12 Although very
recently published evidence began to question this metabolic route in animal studies,38,39 it is still advisable to
take into consideration that the use of potent cytochrome
3A4 inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and macrolides)40,41 has the potential
to interfere in the elimination of methadone, increasing
the risk of elevation of the plasma levels of the drug toward toxic levels. The same effect could be expected when
inhibitors of cytochrome 2B6 (such as haloperidol, levopromazine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and chlorimipramine)40 are used concomitantly with methadone,
because it is also related with methadone metabolism.
Doxorubicin, vimblastin, and actinomycin, frequently
used in cancer patients, are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein,
and by impairing the ability of the blood-brain barrier to
block excessive transference of methadone to the central
nervous system, might predispose patients to have increasing plasmatic levels of methadone despite stable dosing.

Prolongation of the QT interval is associated with
increased risk of severe arrhythmias42 and has been
reported to be associated with the use of methadone.14,15,43 We did not find any clinical evidence of cardiac rhythm alterations after the introduction of
methadone. However, because neither cardiac effects nor
the concomitant use of other potentially arrhythmogenic
drugs were formally assessed in this retrospective study,
we are unable to draw definitive conclusions regarding the
cardiac safety of methadone. Therefore, it is still advisable
to obtain information regarding the presence of electrolyte imbalances or the concomitant use of other cardiotoxic drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, diuretics, and
antipsychotics.44
The significant association between morphine
equivalent daily dose of the previous opioid (Fig. 2) and
the variable morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone
ratio confirms previous reports from other authors.23-26,45
We found in univariate analysis that greater morphine
equivalent daily dose:methadone ratios are associated
with older age, rotation because of side effects, and
higher previous opioid doses. In the multivariate model,
reason for rotation and previous opioid doses (grouped
according to previously published evidence45) remained
independently associated with greater morphine equivalent daily dose:methadone ratio. Our findings in the outpatient setting are similar to those recently reported in a
study with 54 patients who underwent rotation in the
inpatient setting, which showed that the median morphine:methadone ratio ranged from 2:1 to 15:1, being independently associated with previous opioid doses and
reason for rotation.45 These findings suggest that methadone behaves in a different manner as compared with
other opioids with regard to opioid sensitivity, and caution should be exercised in patients who had escalation
of the previous opioid.
We were not able to find a significant number of
patients who were rotated to methadone because of financial issues in our limited sample. This might be because of
the finding that when financial cost is identified by the
palliative care team as a concern, patients are already
started on methadone as a first-line strong opioid. However, it was impossible to obtain this detailed information
for methadone initiations in this retrospective study. Our
group and others45-48 have already reported that methadone is a very inexpensive drug, being an ideal alternative
to other opioids, particularly in developing countries
where cost of treatment is often a barrier in providing
excellent care to patients with cancer pain.

Conclusions
Methadone was effective for use as both first- and secondline opioid. Patients exhibited tolerable side effects to the
drug. Our study adds to the growing evidence in the literature to recommend such use. Further prospective studies
on the use of methadone as a first-line strong opioid with
longer follow-up periods are required to confirm our clinical findings.
