ABSTRACT
Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) were originally characterized
as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), acting as potent antiangiogenic
proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that the arylsulfonamide derivative
MPT0G013 has potent antiangiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo via inducing
TIMP3 expression. Treatments with MPT0G013 significantly inhibited endothelial cell
functions, such as cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as induced
p21 and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Subsequent microarray analysis showed
significant induction of TIMP3 gene expression by MPT0G013, and siRNA-mediated
blockage of TIMP3 up-regulation abrogated the antiangiogenic activities of MPT0G013
and prevented inhibition of p-AKT and p-ERK proteins. Importantly, MPT0G013
exhibited antiangiogenic activities in in vivo Matrigel plug assays, inhibited tumor
growth and up-regulated TIMP3 and p21 proteins in HCT116 mouse xenograft models.
These data suggest potential therapeutic application of MPT0G013 for angiogenesisrelated diseases such as cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Previous studies show that the initial stages of
angiogenesis involve degradation of extracellular matrices
by proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
family. Thus, MMPs and MMP inhibitors play important
roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [4,
5]. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3)
is a member of the TIMP family of proteins, which
are expressed ubiquitously as natural MMP protease
inhibitors. Unlike other TIMP family members, TIMP3
is a secretory protein that binds extracellular matrices
[6]. TIMP3 is produced constitutively in the eye by
choroidal endothelial cells and retina pigment epithelium
(RPE) [7, 8]. Due to its potent MMP-inhibitory activity,
TIMP3 affects physiological tissue remodeling and
developmental processes by regulating cell growth,
invasion, and migration [9]. Under pathological

The importance of blood vessel growth, or
angiogenesis, has been demonstrated as an essential step
during embryonic development, tissue repair, and vascular
diseases [1].  During recent decades, early pioneers of
angiogenic research discovered that growth and metastasis
of tumors depend on vascularization. Angiogenic proteins,
such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)
and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), are secreted by
tumors to initiate angiogenesis by stimulating proteolytic
degradation of capillary basement membranes, thereby
promoting endothelial cell migration, proliferation,
and formation of tube-like structures [2]. Therefore,
angiogenesis is a promising target for anticancer
treatments [3].

conditions, TIMP3 has been demonstrated as a potent
inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth [10]. Thus,
silencing of TIMP3 is a common event in solid tumors and
promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by increasing the
activity of MMPs. [11]. Mutation of TIMP3 is associated
with Sorsby’s fundus dystrophy, a macular degenerative
disease with submacular choroidal neovascularization
[12-14]. Recent studies have demonstrated that TIMP3
inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF–KDR binding
and downstream signaling pathways, including activation
of Akt and ERK. Because TIMP1, TIMP2, and other
MMP inhibitors do not inhibit interactions between VEGF
and KDR, this effect may be independent of the MMPinhibitory activity of TIMP3 [15].
In the present study, we investigated antiangiogenic
activities of the arylsulfonamide derivative MPT0G013
(3-[1-(3,4-dimethoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-1H-indol-5-yl]N-hydroxy-acrylamide) in vivo and in vitro. MPT0G013
was discovered in previous studies, which described
potent inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) in vitro
[16]. However, the effects of this compound on tumor
angiogenesis have not been investigated previously. The
present data show that MPT0G013 inhibits angiogenesis
by up-regulating TIMP3 gene expression in endothelial
and tumor cells, indicating the potential of MPT0G013
as a therapeutic agent with dual activities against tumor
growth and angiogenesis.

inhibits endothelial cell DNA synthesis in a concentrationdependent manner (GI50 = 0.19 ± 0.02 μM). Subsequently,
we evaluated the effect of MPT0G013 on the formation
of capillary networks using Matrigel assays. HUVECs
were seeded in a matrigel-coated 96-well plate and treated
with or without MPT0G013. Figure 1D shows induction
of differentiation by endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM2; control group) in human umbilical vein epithelial cells
(HUVECs), and formation of highly branched networks
of capillary-like structures. In contrast, MPT0G013
treatments significantly inhibited tube formation in a
concentration-dependent manner. Tube lengths were
then analyzed and counted in five randomly selected
areas of samples under microscope field using Image
analysis software (Image-Pro® Plus). In agreement with
the results (Figure 1D, left panel), the right panel in
Figure 1D shows 44.3% (P < 0.05), 68.8% (P < 0.005),
and 90.6% (P < 0.001) inhibition following treatment
with 0.3, 1, and 3 μM MPT0G013, respectively. Because
the chemotactic motility of endothelial cells is essential
during the angiogenic sprouting process, we used Boyden
chamber assays to determine the effects of MPT0G013
on endothelial cell migration. Treatment with MPT0G013
for 6h concentration dependently inhibited EGM-2induced cell migration (Figure 1E). Taken together, these

MPT0G013 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro
Endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation,
and migration are essential steps in angiogenesis, and
growth factors play important roles during angiogenesis
through their mitogenic effects on endothelial cells [2].
Initially, we screened several arylsulfonamide derivatives
for antiangiogenic activities using cell-based crystal
violet assays. After treatment with or without a series
of compounds for 72 hrs in EGM-2 medium, cells were
then stained with crystal violet and measured the effect
on cell growth. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1B,
MPT0G013 showed the most potent antiproliferative
activity, with a GI50 value of 0.14 ± 0.01 µM. Therefore,
we chose MPT0G013 for further studies of antiangiogenic
activities and mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. To examine
the effects of MPT0G013 on angiogenesis, we performed
a series of well-established functional assays. Among
these, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation
assays was carried out in EGM-2 medium. Proliferating
HUVECs were starved overnight and then were treated
with or without MPT0G013 at various concentrations
for total 48 hrs. BrdU-labeling reagent were added at
the last 18 h. Figure 1C demonstrated that MPT0G013

increased the percentage of HUVECs in the G0/G1
phase and decreased the population of cells in S, G2,
and M phases in a concentration-dependent manner.
Subsequently, we examined the effect of MPT0G013 on
the expression of cell cycle regulating proteins of the G0/
G1 phase. MPT0G013 significantly increased protein
expression of p21 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27, and downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 in a concentrationand time-dependent manner (Figure 2D). Cyclin A and
phosphorylated Rb proteins were also down-regulated
after 12- and 18-h treatments. Interestingly, MPT0G013
had no effect on the expression of CDK4.

MPT0G013 induces G0/G1 arrest in HUVECs
To determine whether MPT0G013 impairs
cell proliferation, we examined cell cycle phases
using flow cytometry assays. In Figure 2A, treatment
with MPT0G013 for 18 h increased 20.5% of cells
accumulation in the G0/G1 phase and decreased 20.3%
of cells in the S/G2/M phase compared with CTL. As
shown in Figures 2B–2C, treatment with MPT0G013

up-regulated TIMP3 mRNA up to 18-fold, and increased
TIMP3 protein expression in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. To further investigate whether
MPT0G013 increased TIMP3 expression at the
transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, we utilized
the Click-iT® Nascent RNA Capture kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) to labeled nascent RNA and isolated
from cells. Figure 3C shows that nascent TIMP3 mRNA
was significantly up-regulated by MPT0G013 up to 14fold relative to CTL, indicating that MPT0G013 affected
TIMP3 expression at the transcriptional activation.
To confirm that TIMP3 is an important mediator of
MPT0G013-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis, we
knocked down TIMP3 using specific siRNA (Figure 3D).

Silencing of TIMP3 in endothelial cells also significantly
rescued migration in the presence of MPT0G013 (Figure
3F). Previous studies also show that TIMP3 regulates
angiogenesis by blocking VEGF signaling through Akt
and ERK pathways [15]. Moreover, Figure 3D shows
that TIMP3-silencing in MPT0G013-treated HUVECs
led to a highly significant increase in the expression
of phosphorylated Akt and ERK relative to that in the
siCTL control group. These observations indicate that

MPT0G013 inhibits angiogenesis by up-regulating TIMP3
expression, and subsequently by inhibiting downstream
PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling pathways.

MPT0G013 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and
growth by up-regulating TIMP3
To investigate the effects of MPT0G013 on
angiogenic growth factors in vivo, we performed
Matrigel plug assays. Growth factors were mixed with
Matrigel and were implanted subcutaneously into  nu/
nu mice. After 7 days, the Matrigel plugs were excised
following hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemical staining for the angiogenic
marker CD31. The CD31-postive area was quantified
by using the NIH Image J software (Bethesda, MD). In
these experiments, significant antiangiogenic effects
were observed after oral administration of MPT0G013
(Figure 4A and 4B). Subsequent hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) staining and CD31 staining also showed
decreased vasculature in MPT0G013 infused gels than
in growth factor-only infused control plugs (Figure 4A
and 4B). Angiogenesis was then quantified by measuring
hemoglobin contents in plugs, which showed that
MPT0G013 significantly inhibited angiogenesis by 96% at
10 μM. Furthermore, MPT0G013 also showed significant
antiangiogenic effect by 84% and 97% after oral

DISCUSSION

administration at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg/d, respectively.
(Figure 4C).
Numerous studies demonstrate that tumor growth
is dependent on angiogenesis and that inhibition of
angiogenesis can attenuate tumor growth. In the present
study, we further evaluated whether MPT0G013
directly affects tumor growth and angiogenesis in a
colon carcinoma (HCT116) xenograft model. These
experiments showed no symptoms  of toxicity such as
weight loss in MPT0G013-treated mice (n = 5; Figure 4D,
top panel), indicating tolerance of treatments. Untreated
control HCT116 xenografts grew to >900 mm3 in 25
days, whereas the mean tumor volumes in MPT0G013
treated mice (50 and 100 mg/kg/day) were <550 mm3
and <160 mm3 at this time point, respectively (Figure 4D,
bottom panel). To further investigate inhibition of tumor
growth and angiogenesis by MPT0G013, we performed
immunohistochemical staining for the angiogenic marker
CD31. Administration of MPT0G013 significantly
decreased the numbers of CD31-expressing vessels
relative to those in the CTL group (Figure 4E). Moreover,
these in vivo antiangiogenic and antitumor effects were
corroborated in western blot analyses of drug-induced
intratumoral markers. Figure 4F shows that the significant
increases in protein expression of TIMP3 in tumor tissues
from the MPT0G013-treated mice were accompanied by
up-regulation of p21. Although angiogenesis is essential
for tumor growth and metastasis and constitutes an
important role in the control of cancer progression [17],
previous studies showed that anti-angiogenic therapies
may accelerate invasion and metastasis. Sunitinib, a smallmolecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the antiVEGFR2 antibody DC101 stimulated tumor metastasis
despite their inhibition of primary tumor growth in
some cases [18, 19]. We therefore generated lung tumor
metastases model to evaluate the effect of MPT0G013
treatment on cancer cell metastasis in vivo. HCT-116
colon cancer cells were injected into the tail vein of
severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID) mice, which
then received vehicle treatment or MPT0G013 (25mg/
kg every other day) just after tumor cells inoculation.
At the study endpoint, the lungs in mice were surgically
resected and evaluated. Compared to the control group,
the mice treated with 25 mg/kg MPT0G013 exhibited
significantly decreased levels and numbers of lung surface
metastasis (Figure 4G, 4H). The lung weights were also
reduced in the MPT0G013 treatment group relative to the
control group (Figure 4I). The results demonstrate that
MPT0G013 does not promote metastasis in the HCT-116
metastasis animal model, instead, may interrupt the cancer
cells metastasis in vivo. Taken together, these results
indicate that MPT0G013 abrogates growth factor-induced
angiogenesis by up-regulating the antiangiogenic protein
TIMP3 in vitro and in vivo, and leads to tumor growth
inhibition.

TIMP3 was originally identified as an in vitro
and in vivo inhibitor of angiogenesis in 1997 [10],
and for many years, it was accepted that TIMPs
primarily inhibit MMPs [20, 21]. However, more recent
evidence indicates multiple functions of TIMPs that are
independent of MMP-inhibitory properties. Furthermore,
inhibition of angiogenesis by TIMP3 was suggested to
be distinct from MMP-inhibitory activities, and recent
evidences indicate that inhibition of VEGF-induced cell
proliferation and migration by TIMP3 reflects decreased
binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 [15]. Loss of TIMP3 has
been shown to enhance hepatoprotective EGFR ligand
shedding and downstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
mouse  embryonic  fibroblasts (MEFs) [22]. Moreover,
lentiviral overexpression of TIMP3 in mensenchymal
cells led to decreased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt
[23]. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that
TIMP3 is frequently down-regulated in various types
of cancer [11, 24]. Furthermore, numerous studies have
demonstrated that activation of PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/
ERK signaling by many growth factors is essential for
normal cellular G1/S phase transitions, cell proliferation,
and migration of endothelial cells [25-27]. Data from
preclinical studies demonstrate that inhibitors of PI3K/
Akt and ERK signaling pathway are potent antiangiogenic
agents that inhibit tumor growth [28, 29]. In the present
study, silencing of TIMP3 significantly reversed the
inhibitory effects of MPT0G013 on Akt and ERK
phosphorylation, suggesting that TIMP3 is an important
target of MPT0G013. Although the data in Table 2 show
down-regulation of angiogenic genes by MPT0G013,
siTIMP3 significantly rescued DNA synthesis and cell
migration in MPT0G013-treated HUVECs, suggesting
that MPT0G013-induced TIMP3 plays a major role in the
observed antiangiogenic effects. However, MPT0G013
also inhibited ANGPT2, FGF16, PLAUR and PlGF
gene expression (Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 2).
Therefore, down-regulation of angiogenic genes may also
contribute to the antiangiogenic effect of MPT0G013. We
also observed only slight decreases in MMP-2 and MMP9 protein expression after treatment with MPT0G013
(data not shown). However, because silencing of TIMP3
enhanced the migration of endothelial cells through
gelatin-coated membranes (both-sided), the contribution
of targeting these MMPs may only represent a minor
effect of MPT0G013.
Microarray analyses showed that MPT0G013
inhibited the expression of various angiogenic genes
and up-regulated the anti-angiogenic genes, including
IGFBP3 and TIMP3. The role of insulin-like growth
factor binding-protein 3 (IGFBP3) in inhibition of VEGFinduced endothelial cell growth and antiangiogenesis is
well established [30, 31]. Thus, we confirmed the effects
of MPT0G013 on IGFBP3 mRNA expression using
9845

Oncotarget

quantitative RT-PCR, and showed 7-fold induction relative
to the CTL (Supplemental Figure 3A). However, in BrdU
incorporation assays, silencing of IGFBP3 in MPT0G013treated cells only slightly reversed the antiproliferative
effects relative to the CTL group (Supplemental Figure
3B). Therefore, we assumed that IGFBP3 may also
contribute to the antiangiogenic activities of MPT0G013
but plays relatively a minor role compared with TIMP3.
MPT0G013 is reportedly a novel HDAC inhibitor
that suppresses tumor cell growth [16]. We confirmed
more potent inhibition of HDAC activity by MPT0G013
than by the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (Supplemental
Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 1). Previous studies
showed that SAHA was found to be a potent inhibitor
of class I isoforms (HDAC1, 0.03 μM; HDAC2, 0.92
μM) and class IIb (HDAC6, 0.03 μM) in biochemical
assays, with relatively weak inhibitory activity for the
class IIa isoforms [32]. We showed that SAHA inhibited
HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC6 with IC50 of 118.4, 506.5
and 113.5 nM, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
The IC50 values from our results represented the similar
pattern of HDAC inhibitory effect of SAHA compared
with previous studies. Evidence also demonstrated that
utilizing the same kit (HDAC Biochemical Assay kit, BPS
Biosciences, CA, USA) showed significantly different
IC50 values [33-35]. We assumed that the activities from
different batches of enzymes are various, and also affected
by its laboratory environmental conditions. However, our
results showed that MPT0G013 and SAHA were Class
I/IIb HDAC inhibitors and MPT0G013 is more potent
than SAHA. Moreover, MPT0G013 significantly induced
TIMP3 mRNA and protein expression in endothelial cells
and tumor xenografts, and whereas SAHA had a similar
pattern of inhibitory activities on HDAC subtypes, it
barely induced TIMP3 gene or protein expression in
vitro (Supplemental Figure 5A) or in vivo (Supplemental
Figure 5B and 5C). Hence, we suggest that this effect is an
exclusive novel property of MPT0G013.
We evaluated the anti-proliferative effect of
MPT0G013 on various human cancer cell lines using
SRB assay. Supplemental table 2 showed that MPT0G013
inhibited the proliferation of A549, HCT-116, Hep3B,
MDA-MB-231, PC-3 and SK-OV-3 with GI50 values of
0.44, 0.34, 0.57, 0.32, 0.42, 0.35 µM. The GI50 values of
MPT0G013 in cancer cell lines are about 3-fold higher
compared to MPT0G013 in HUVECs. From the results,
we could not rule out the effect of MPT0G013 on tumor
cells in the xenograft model. However, MPT0G013
significantly inhibited growth factors-induced blood
vessel formation in the matrigel plug assay and the tumor
xenograft model. Therefore, we suggest that MPT0G013
is a potent anti-angiogenic agent in vivo.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report to show that the novel antiangiogenic
agent MPT0G013 up-regulates the tumor suppressor gene
TIMP3 in endothelial cells, and subsequently attenuates
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

downstream signaling via PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways.
Using Matrigel plug assays and the tumor xenograft
models, we provide strong evidence that MPT0G013
inhibits tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, ex vivo
immunoblot analyses showed significant up-regulation of
p21 and TIMP3 expression in tumors from MPT0G013treated mice. In summary, the present data demonstrate
MPT0G013 as a novel candidate for the treatment of
angiogenesis-related diseases such as cancer.

In vivo matrigel plug assay

Crystal violet assay

Female nude-athymic mice of 6 weeks old and
weighing ~20g were used in matrigel plug assay , and
all animal experiments followed ethical standards, and
protocols have been reviewed and approved by Animal
Use and Management Committee of National Taiwan
University (NTU IACUC approved No. 20120533).
Mice were divided into two groups with 3 animals in
each group. One experiment was injected abdomens
subcutaneously with Matrigel (BD Bioscience) mixed
with several angiogenic factors (40 ng/ml), with or
without MPT0G013 (1 μM and 10 μM), while the other
experiment was injected with Matrigel containing growth
factors only and subsequently given MPT0G013 (25 mg/
kg/d and 50 mg/kg/d) by oral administration. After seven
days, the animals were sacrificed and the matrigels were
carefully dissected and photographed. To quantify the
blood vessel formation, hemoglobin content was analyzed
by Drabkin’s reagent kit (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis,
MO).

Growing HUVECs seeded in 96-well culture plates
(5.0 x 103 cells per well) were treated with MPT0G013
in EGM-2 medium at various concentrations (0.01-1 and
0.1-10, respectively). After 3 days of incubation at 37°C,
the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 10
minutes. Then the dye was eluted by 0.1 M sodium citrate,
and absorbance is measured at 540 nm with an ELISA
reader. The relative percent of cell growth was calculated
by comparison between the control and the MPT0G013treated wells.

DNA synthesis assay
Cell proliferation was measured by 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into newly synthesized
DNA of growing HUVECs with the colorimetric ELISA
assay (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Endothelial cells
seeded in 96-well culture plates (5.0 x 103 cells per well)
were starved with EBM-2 medium overnight. Then the
cells were treated with EGM-2 medium alone (control)
or medium with different concentrations of MPT0G013
for 48 hours or indicated times. Growth factor-containing
EGM-2 medium prompted the cells to re-enter the cell
cycle, allowing us to monitor the cells movement into S
phase and G2. To label the synthesized DNA, 10 µM BrdU
was added to cultures for the last 18 hours before staining.
After incubation, the cells were fixed and detected by
BrdU ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

In vivo mouse tumor xenograft assay
Male 4 weeks old BALB/c nude mice were
implanted s.c. with HCT-116 cells. When the tumors
reached the average volume of 90 mm3, the mice were
divided into four groups (n = 5) and then were treated
orally with vehicle (1% carboxymethyl cellulose + 0.5%
Tween 80, 0.2 mL/mouse) or MPT0G013 (50 and 100 mg/
kg/d). The length (L) and width (W) of the tumor were
measured every 3 to 4 days, and the tumor volume was
calculated as LW2 / 2. The protocols of the in vivo study
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at
National Taiwan University.

Boyden Chamber migration assay
The evaluation of HUVEC cell migration was
performed by using boyden chamber with 8 µM pore sized
filters which was pre-coated with 0.5 % gelatin both sides.
Proliferating HUVECs were pretreated with the indicated
concentrations of MPT0G013 for 6h, and then the cells
were harvested and resuspended in serum-free EBM-2
media with the indicated concentrations of MPT0G013. An
equal number of cells (105) were seeded to the chambers
in triplicate. To allow for cell migration, EGM-2 medium
was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After
six hours incubation, the membranes containing migrated
cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and
the cells on the upper filter were removed with the cotton
swabs. The migrated cells were counted and photographed
under a microscope. Five fields were randomly chosen for
each membrane, and the results were expressed as percent
of migrated cells.

In vivo metastatic animal model
In the metastatic experiment, HCT-116 colon cancer
cells (1 x 107 cells/ml) were injected directly into the
lateral tail vein of 4 weeks old male SCID mice. After the
intravenous tumor inoculation, vehicle (1% carboxymethyl
cellulose + 0.5% Tween 80, 0.2 mL/mouse) or MPT0G013
(25mg/kg) was given by oral administration every other
day (n = 4 in each group). Mice were sacrificed at 42
days, and the lungs were removed, photographed and
fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The lung surface metastatic
nodules (Ф > 1 mm) were counted under the dissected
microscope (Optima) and the gross weight of individual
lungs were quantified. The protocols of the in vivo study
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at
National Taiwan University.

Capillary tube formation assay

established at |log2 ratio| n≥ 1 and P < 0.05, by using
DAVID Bioinformatic Resources (NIH, Bethesda, MD)
subjected to gene ontology analysis compared with the
control sample. Microarray data is has been uploaded
to the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo; accession number GSE56927). The data is
private until April 20, 2017.

HUVECs were cultured in complete EGM-2
medium with the indicated concentrations of MPT0G013
and seeded onto the Matrigel (Growth factor reduced,
BD Biosciences) which was coated in the 96 wells
at density of 1.75 x 104 cells/well. After 18 hours of
incubation, tubular network structures were visualized
and photographed using a phase contrast microscope. The
relative tube lengths were measured and analyzed by using
Image analysis software (Image-Pro® Plus).

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative
reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent by
a standard protocol. mRNA (5 μg) was incubated with
random primer at 65°C for 5 minutes, and then reacted
with M-MLV RT at 37°C for 1 hour to obtain cDNA.
Quantitative PCR was performed with mastermix (TaqMan
One Step RT-PCR; ABI) in a total reaction volume of 20
μl per reaction, containing 10 ml of SYBR green PCR
master mix (Applied Biosystems), 5 pmol of each forward
and reverse primer and 2 μl of cDNA. Amplification of
TIMP3 was performed using the following primers:
5’-TGCTCTCTGTCTCTTTTTTCAGCTT-3’ (forward)
and
5’-CTACAGTGTGTTGTCTGCTGCTTTT-3’
(reverse). GAPDH was used as an endogenous control.

Flow cytometric analysis
Briefly, HUVECs were starved with EBM-2
medium overnight and were subsequently replaced with
EGM-2 medium with or without MPT0G013 (0.1, 0.3, 1
μM) at the indicated times. After trypsinized and fixed in
ice-cold 75% methanol for one hour at -20°C, HUVECs
were washed with PBS and resuspended in 0.2 ml DNA
extraction buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4, 0.1 M citric acid; pH
7.8) for 30 minutes. Then the cells were stained with
propidium iodide solution (PI; 100 µg/ml RNase, 80
µg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100) in PBS.
FACScan flow cytometry was utilized to determine Cell
cycle distribution, and data analysis was performed with
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Label and capture nascent RNA
Newly synthesized RNA was isolated using ClickiT Nascent RNA Capture Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly,
HUVECs were treated with or without MPT0G013 (1
µM) and incubated in 0.2 mM of 5-ethymyluridine (EU,
an alkyne-modified uridine analog, which is efficiently
and naturally incorporated into the nascent RNA) for total
6 h and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent.
Then, a click reaction was performed using 5 µg of EUlabeled RNA and 0.5 mM biotin azide; the mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Following
RNA precipitation, the RNA was resuspended in 30 µl of
RNase-free water. Biotin-labeled EU-RNA-binding pulldown assay was performed using 12 µl of Dynabeads○RR
MyOneTM Streptavidin and bound RNA was washed. The
cDNA synthesis was performed directly on the beads
using Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen)
followed by analysis with QRT-PCR.

Western blotting
HUVECs were harvested after treatment of
MPT0G013 in EGM-2 medium, and the total cell lysates
were prepared in a modified RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet p-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors
(1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 M NaF, 0.5
M Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The
cellular proteins were applied to immunoblot separated by
8%-12% poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by
electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
Membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk,
washed with PBS, probed with specific antibodies and
measured by utilizing an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) detection system.
