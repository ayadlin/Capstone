Abstract
Many inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-RAS-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway are in clinical use or under development for
cancer therapy. Here, we show that treatment of mice bearing
human tumor xenografts with inhibitors that block EGFR,
RAS, PI3K, or AKT resulted in prolonged and durable
enhancement of tumor vascular flow, perfusion, and decreased tumor hypoxia. The vessels in the treated tumors
had decreased tortuosity and increased internodal length
accounting for the functional alterations. Inhibition of tumor
growth cannot account for these results, as the drugs were
given at doses that did not alter tumor growth. The tumor cell
itself was an essential target, as HT1080 tumors that lack
EGFR did not respond to an EGFR inhibitor but did respond
with vascular alterations to RAS or PI3K inhibition. We
extended these observations to spontaneously arising tumors
in MMTV-neu mice. These tumors also responded to PI3K
inhibition with decreased tumor hypoxia, increased vascular
flow, and morphologic alterations of their vessels, including
increased vascular maturity and acquisition of pericyte
markers. These changes are similar to the vascular normalization that has been described after the antiangiogenic
treatment of xenografts. One difficulty in the use of vascular
normalization as a therapeutic strategy has been its limited
duration. In contrast, blocking tumor cell RAS-PI3K-AKT
signaling led to persistent vascular changes that might be
incorporated into clinical strategies based on improvement of
vascular flow or decreased hypoxia. These results indicate
that vascular alterations must be considered as a consequence
of signaling inhibition in cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;

Introduction
Tumor growth requires induction of angiogenesis to maintain
nutrient and oxygen supplies to rapidly dividing cells. However,
tumor vasculature is often disorganized with blood vessels that
are aberrant both morphologically and functionally. The vessels are
often dilated, irregular in distribution and shape, and have
abnormal pericyte and basement membrane coverage (1, 2). As a
result, vasculature function is compromised. Perfusion of tumor

vessels is variable and subject to interruptions. The vessels are
leaky, leading to high tumor interstitial pressure, which can disrupt
diffusion into the tumor stroma (3). These defects contribute to
tumor hypoxia, which is associated with poor prognosis and
treatment response.
Clinically, hypoxic tumors are more resistant to radiation therapy,
in part because radiation requires oxygen for maximal fixation of
the radical species that cause DNA damage (4). Hypoxic tumors also
resist cytotoxic drug treatment because of poor perfusion and
diffusion into hypoxic tumor areas and because hypoxia both
impedes the function of some cytoxic drugs and may induce
resistance mechanisms (reviewed in refs. 5, 6).
Treatments that target tumor vasculature ablate vascular flow or
reduce tumor angiogenesis, but these approaches are likely to
exacerbate hypoxia. Vasculature-targeting drugs, such as combretastatin, are toxic to tumor vessels, leading to necrosis in the
central areas of tumors and result in diminished perfusion and
increased central hypoxia (7). However peripheral vascular supplies
and neoangiogenesis can maintain viable tumor cells in the tumor
periphery, leading to tumor regrowth (8). In addition, the
antivascular effects of the therapy can decrease subsequent
cytotoxic drug delivery and diminish radiation cytotoxicity due to
reduced tumor oxygenation.
A second approach to modifying vascular function is to block
tumor angiogenic signaling. Normal tissue angiogenesis is a wellregulated process that balances proangiogenic and antiangiogenic
signaling, resulting in the formation of ordered, mature vessels with
basement membrane support and abundant pericyte coverage. In
contrast, tumor angiogenesis is deregulated, with a preponderance
of proangiogenic signaling, primarily through the overproduction
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF overexpression
is linked to signaling by pathways that are constitutively activated
in tumor cells (9). Treatment with antibodies targeting the VEGF
receptor results in transient enhancement of vascular function
termed as ‘‘vascular normalization.’’ The accompanying period of
enhanced oxygenation corresponded to a period of enhanced
radiosensitivity in treated tumors (10). However, the transient
nature of these changes poses problems for clinical application of
this approach.
Because tumor angiogenesis is linked to activation of oncogenic
signaling pathways, another approach to modulating tumor
vasculature is to target these pathways. However, the effects of
tumor signaling inhibition on tumor vasculature has not been well
characterized. Targeting RAS activation with FTIs was shown to
increase oxygenation in tumor xenografts (11). Treatment of
tumor-bearing mice with Nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor with
pleotropic effects, including down-regulation of AKT signaling, also
led to enhanced tumor oxygenation and correlated with decreased
VEGF expression (12). Although both studies showed significant
changes in tumor oxygenation, the mechanisms for these changes

were not defined. We have now explored the vascular changes
that could account for the changes in oxygenation and asked
whether inhibition at other points in the RAS signaling pathway
would have similar effects.
In this report, we show that treatment of mice bearing tumors
with agents that disrupt the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-RAS-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling
pathway at each of these points results in increased tumor
oxygenation. Treatment with each of these inhibitors leads to
morphologic changes that promote increased perfusion. Most
importantly the approach of targeting tumor signaling yields a
sustained effect that may allow prolonged enhancement of drug
delivery and improved efficacy of radiation therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37jC in water-saturated 5% CO2. The HT1080

cell line expressing pGL-HRE, a luciferase reporter construct driven by three
hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) binding sequences for hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF), was kindly provided by Christopher Pugh (Oxford University,
Oxford, United Kingdom). SQ20B cells were transfected with pGL-HRE,
and transfectants were selected with 2 Ag/mL puromycin (Calbiochem).
Resistant clones were selected.
Examination of hypoxia response in vitro. To determine the kinetics of
luciferase expression under hypoxia and reoxygenation, cells were seeded in
six-well or 96-well plates and cultured in phenol-free L-15 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum under hypoxia (0.1% O2) using the In vivo 400 system
(Ruskinn). At 0, 8, 16, or 24 h, cells in 96-well plates were lysed and assayed
using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay kit (Promega). Live cell images of
luminescence were obtained on the IVIS 200 optical imaging system (Xenogen)
after addition of luciferin (150 mg/mL) to cells in six-well plates. Both methods
gave equivalent results. For reoxygenation studies, six-well plates seeded with
400,000 cells were maintained under 0.1% hypoxia for 16 h. Images were
acquired on replicate cultures at 15-min intervals after reoxygenation.

Tumor Vascular Changes after Oncogenic Signaling Inhibition
immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Charles River) were inoculated with 106
cells on the hind leg s.c. Treatments were initiated when tumors reached
100 mm3. In all experiments, animals were treated with carrier (50% DMSO,
50% PBS), L778,123 (40 mg/kg), Iressa (50 mg/kg), Nelfinavir (20 mg/kg), or
PI-103 (5 mg/kg) by daily i.p. injections. Inhibitors were given daily for up to
2 wk. Transgenic mice [FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-neu) 202 Mul/J] were treated with
either carrier or PI-103 by daily injections for 2 wk once tumors had reached
150 to 200 mm3.
In vivo imaging. Optical and ultrasound/power Doppler were carried
out under anesthesia (2% isofluorane in oxygen). Luciferin (150 mg/kg,
Xenogen) was given i.p. 5 min before optical imaging on an IVIS 200 system
(Xenogen). Ultrasound imaging was done on a Vevo770 (Visualsonics).
Doppler image analysis was done with Visualsonics software, as described
in ref. (13). Ultrasound microbubble contrast imaging was done after bolus
i.v. injection of nontargeting contrast reagent (Visualsonics). Propriety
software modules were used for analysis of visual and ultrasound
measurements. Microbubble influx was quantified using a Visualsonics
software module based on ref. (14).
Confocal/multiphoton microscopy. At the indicated times, animals
were injected with 0.01 mL/g body weight of 10 mmol/L nitroimmidazole
hypoxic cell marker, EF5, dissolved in glucose/normal saline and given
3 h (i.v.) and 2.5 h (i.p.) before sacrifice.4 Vascular perfusion was visualized
with anti-CD31-RPE-conjugated antibody (20 Ag, 102408, Biolegend) and
extravascular diffusion with either Hoechst dye (0.4 mg, Sigma) or 10 kMW
Dextran-Alexa-647 (0.4 mg, D22914, Invitrogen) injected 10 and 1 min before
sacrifice, respectively. Tumors were immediately excised and sectioned into
three parts. A central 1-mm-thick section was immediately imaged using
confocal/multiphoton microscropy (Leica). Adjacent sections were snap
frozen or preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde. Confocal/multiphoton stacks
of 100 Am were taken at 0.5-Am intervals, using a 20 lens, on multiple
fields using the 488 laser to excite green fluorescent protein, 543 nm laser to
excite anti-CD31-RPE, and 740 nm Mai-Tai femtosecond pulsing laser
(Spectra Physics) to excite Hoechst or 633 laser to excite Dextran-Alexa-647.
Mean pixel number for CD31-RPE and Hoechst staining for each 100-Am
stack was calculated using proprietary software (Leica). Three-dimensional
vascular reconstructions were compiled using the Amira three-dimensional
software (Visage Imaging). Calculation of vessel geometry and statistics was
performed using the Trace three-dimensional software (15). Determinations
of tortuosity and vessel length were as described by Norrby (16).
Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA studies.
EF5 binding was detected with ELK3-51 monoclonal antibody, as previously
described (11). Immunofluorescence staining for platelet-derived growth
factor-h (PDGF-h; 1:100, ab32570, Abcam), smooth muscle actin (SMA; 1:300,
ab5694, Abcam), and CD31 (1:50, 09151A, BD Pharmingen) was performed
using the TSA biotin system (Pelkin-Elmer) and streptavidin-conjugated
fluorophores Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 (Invitrogen). Images were acquired
using a Leica DM IRBE microscope with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 camera.
Image analysis was done using ImageJ software.5 Staining for carbonic
anhydrase IX (1:1,000, ab15086, Abcam) and EGFR (1:100, ab2430, Abcam)
was detected using the ImmPress Anti-Rabbit IgG (peroxidase) kit (Vector
Laboratories) and visualized using an Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss). VEGF
levels were determined using the Quantikine VEGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis. Unless otherwise stated, error bars indicate SE,
and P values of <0.05 after a two-tailed t test are denoted by an asterisk

HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. In tissue culture, exposure of the cells
to hypoxia (0.1% O2) resulted in induction of luciferase within
8 hours, reaching a maximum by 16 hours in both lines.
Reoxygenation of cultures reduced luciferase to basal levels after
2 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). Both models, thus, are useful
reporters for oxygenation.
Effects of signaling inhibition on tumor hypoxia. The two cell
lines have active RAS-PI3K-AKT signaling. SQ20B overexpresses
EGFR, which causes constitutive activation of RAS and activation
of PI3K and AKT. HT1080 has an oncogenic mutation in N-ras that
results in constitutively active PI3K and AKT. Inhibitors that block
the EGFR-RAS-PI3K-AKT pathway at different points were used
to block signaling. Iressa blocks EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling.
The farnesyltransferase inhibitor L-778,123 inhibits both wild-type
H-RAS and the mutated N-RAS by blocking their prenylation. The
class I PI3K inhibitor PI-103 blocks class I PI3K signaling. Nelfinavir
(Viracept) is a protease inhibitor that indirectly down-regulates
AKT activity (17). Treatment of mice bearing size-matched SQ20Bluc tumors was initiated after a preliminary scan for luciferase
expression. Ten days later, the control tumors had increased
luciferase expression consistent with increased hypoxia (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, tumors in mice treated with Iressa, L-778,123, PI-103, or
Nelfinavir showed decreased luciferase expression consistent with
decreased hypoxia. This was confirmed by decreased binding of the
nitroimidazole hypoxia marker EF5 (Fig. 1D). Decreased expression
of the hypoxia-responsive genes CA-IX and VEGF was also
observed (Supplementary Fig. S2). Altered tumor growth did not
account for the changes in tumor oxygenation because the growth
of the treated tumors was not different from controls (Fig. 1C).
Thus, inhibition of tumor signaling through EGFR-RAS-PI3K-AKT
resulted in significant reduction in tumor hypoxia.
Inhibition of RAS, PI3K, or AKT in HT1080-reduced hypoxia
without reducing tumor growth similar to the results obtained in
SQ20B (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S3). Although one group (18)
has reported EGFR expression in their HT1080 tumors, we did
not detect human EGFR staining in HT1080 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, HT1080 oncogenic signaling through RASPI3K-AKT should be independent of EGFR. Consistent with this,
treatment of HT1080 tumor-bearing mice with the same dose of
Iressa used on SQ20B tumor-bearing mice did not alter tumor
hypoxia (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S3). These data are
consistent with tumor EGFR as the target for Iressa, which leads
to reduction in tumor hypoxia.
Effects of signaling inhibition on tumor blood flow. To define
the mechanisms for reduction of hypoxia after signaling inhibition,
we examined the functional status of tumor vasculature. Threedimensional ultrasound power Doppler was used to measure and
provide a three-dimensional visual representation of SQ20B tumor
vascular function. Three-dimensional reconstructions of serial
Doppler scans through individual tumors show that vascular flow
in treated tumors is significantly greater than in control tumors
(Fig. 2A and B). Similar results were seen in HT1080 tumors treated
with either PI-103 or Nelfinavir, whereas Iressa treatment showed
no effect (Supplementary Fig. S5). To quantitate the rate of vascular
flow in SQ20B tumors, microbubble contrast reagent influx was
measured (Fig. 2C). The slope and magnitude of microbubble influx
permits quantitation of tumor vascular flow. The rate of flow in
HRE-luc SQ20B tumors after treatment of the mice with either
Iressa, L-778,123, or Nelfinavir increased at least 2-fold (Fig. 2C).
Thus, increased oxygenation after signaling inhibition was
associated with an increase in tumor perfusion.

*, P < 0.001; ANOVA = 0.0002.

Treated tumors show increased vascularity and extravascular
diffusion of small molecules. We used ex vivo microscopy to
visualize the morphology of the tumor vasculature. Mice were
injected i.v. with a fluorescently tagged antiendothelial cell
antibody (CD31-RPE) and then with Hoechst dye. Anti-CD31 binds
to vessel walls in perfused vessels, thus indicating the extent of
vascular perfusion during the 10-minute interval between injection
of this antibody and sacrifice of the mouse. Hoechst dye is highly
diffusible outside of vessels. The extent of Hoechst dye staining
reflects both the extent of effective perfusion and the extent of
diffusion of small molecules from the vasculature. Fresh tumor
sections were imaged by confocal/multiphoton microscopy over a
depth of 100 Am at 0.5-Am intervals (Fig. 3A). A comparison of
three-dimensional reconstructions of SQ20B tumors from control
mice or mice treated with either Iressa, L-778,123, or Nelfinavir
revealed that treated tumors had increased perfused vascular
density (Fig. 3B and C). A quantitative examination of the
morphology of the vessels showed that the vessels in tumors from
mice treated with any of the inhibitors were more regular with
increased interbranch length and reduced tortuosity (Fig. 3D;
Supplementary Fig. S6). Similar results were obtained in HT1080
tumors treated with Nelfinavir or PI-103, whereas Iressa treatment
had no significant effects, consistent with the lack of EGFR
expression (Supplementary Fig. S7). The vessels in treated SQ20B
and HT1080 tumors also showed enhanced staining with PDGF-h,
a marker of vascular maturity (Supplementary Fig. S8). These
patterns are consistent with enhanced flow.
The changes seen in SQ20B tumor vasculature after treatment with
signaling inhibition persisted throughout the time course of these
experiments (Fig. 4). Changes were evident 5 days after initiation of
treatment and persisted until 14 days after treatment began (at which
time experiments were terminated to prevent exceeding tumor size
limitations). Thus, the enhanced vascular function and morphologic

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

changes induced by signaling inhibition is more durable than that
reported in response to antiangiogenic agents.
Inhibition of signaling causes vascular normalization
in transgenic tumor model. Studies of angiogenic changes in
xenograft models are instructive, but the tumor vasculature in
xenografts probably develops in a very different way than the
vasculature in spontaneous tumors. Furthermore, growth of human
tumor xenografts requires immunosuppressed mice. We therefore
examined changes resulting from signaling inhibition in a
spontaneous mouse mammary tumor model. FVB-MMTV-neu
mice were monitored until tumors arose and then enrolled into
control or PI-103 treatment groups. These tumors have enhanced
signaling through PI3K (19, 20). Ten days of treatment with PI-103
resulted in increased vascular flow and enhanced tumor oxygenation relative to control tumors (Fig. 5A). In comparison with the
xenograft model, untreated tumors had a greater vascular density
than xenograft tumors. Nonetheless, vascular density and diffusion
from this vasculature were enhanced by PI-103 treatment (Fig. 5B).
The tumor vessels in the treated mice also showed increased
expression of SMA and PDGF-h (Fig. 5C) consistent with a mature
morphology. Analysis of the vascular morphology indicated that
vessels in the treated tumors had increased length and decreased
tortuosity (Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, in these spontaneous
tumors, inhibition of PI3K resulted in prolonged changes in vascular
morphology resulting in enhanced function and decreased hypoxia.

Discussion
Enhanced tumor oxygenation has long been sought as a
means to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy. Transiently
increased oxygenation of tumors has been described in response
to antiangiogenic agents directed at the tumor vasculature
(reviewed in ref. 21). The current report shows an alternate

Tumor Vascular Changes after Oncogenic Signaling Inhibition

approach. We show that targeting tumor signaling in the RASPI3K-AKT pathway leads to a sustained vascular response and
increased oxygenation, suggesting that this strategy might readily
translate into clinical use.
Previous studies documenting vascular normalization used
xenografts models. Because the process of vascularization of a
xenografted tumor differs markedly from vascularization of
spontaneously arising tumors, it was conceivable that xenografts
and spontaneous tumors would differ in their vascular responses.
However, we found that PI3K inhibition reduced hypoxia and
normalized vasculture in a transgene-induced breast cancer model.
The MMTV-neu model that we used is known to use signaling
through this pathway (19, 20). Although the vasculature in the
transgene-induced tumors was more regular and denser than that
of xenografts, treatment with PI-103 still led to increased vascular
density, longer vessels, increased vascular flow, and decreased
hypoxia and morphologic changes consistent with vascular
normalization over the 2-week experimental time course. Thus,
vascular normalization can be shown in transgenic tumor models,
as well as xenografts.
The RAS-PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in many human cancers.
Each component of this signaling pathway is activated in the SQ20B
and HT1080 cell lines and in the spontaneous MMTV-neu-induced
tumors. Each of the drugs tested inhibits at a different point in the
RAS-AKT pathway. In our studies, Iressa, L-778,123, PI-103, and
Nelfinavir did not alter tumor growth. In general, the effects of these
drugs on tumor growth are variable with some instances of tumor
growth inhibition but also reports in which growth was not affected.
For example, PI-103 inhibited the growth of a Kaposi sarcoma as a
xenograft although the dose was higher than that used here (22). In

contrast, PI-103 did not inhibit the growth of glioblastoma cell line
U251 grown as a xenograft (23). The glioblastoma cell line U87 was
inhibited, but not before 17 days of treatment (24).
Each of these inhibitors has a different mode of action and
different known off-target effects. L-778,123 inhibits farnesyl and
geranylgeranyl transferases, resulting in RAS inhibition while also
affecting other prenylated proteins (25). FTI treatment results in
radiosensitization and reduced tumor hypoxia, but the mechanisms
for these effects have not been defined previously (11, 26).
PI-103 is one of the most specific class I PI3K inhibitors available,
although it also blocks mTOR and DNA-PK (24, 27). In a report by
Chen and colleagues, 10 mg/kg/d PI-103 showed no effect on U251
glioblastoma growth while combining PI-103 treatment with
radiation sensitized these tumors. Nelfinavir, although designed to
be an HIV protease inhibitor, also blocks the chymotrypsin-like
proteasome subunit (28, 29). Nelfinavir inhibition of AKT is indirect
and may involve the unfolded protein response, thus affecting other
signaling pathways (17, 30). Nelfinavir treatment has been shown to
result in reduced tumor hypoxia, decreased levels of VEGF, and
radiosensitization of xenografts (12, 17). Pore and colleagues noted
antiangiogenic effects from Nelfinavir in Matrigel plug angiogenesis
assays admixed with tumor cells (31). The effects on tumor
vasculature were not defined in these studies. Although each of
these compounds has off-target effects, they all act on different points
in EGFR to AKT signaling and there is no obvious confounding
off-target effect that would be common to these different agents
and could explain the shared effect on tumor vasculature.
Activation of the RAS-AKT pathway in SQ20B is due to EGFR
overexpression, which is common in many head and neck
squamous cell and non-small cell lung carcinomas (32, 33).

Treatment with Iressa, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
caused enhanced tumor blood flow, increased vascularity and
maturation, and increased oxygenation in SQ20B tumors. In
contrast, Iressa treatment of mice bearing HT1080 xenografts had
little effect on tumor vasculature or hypoxia. In our studies, HT1080
did not express EGFR either in tissue culture or as a tumor. These
data suggest that the tumor cells, rather than the host vascular
endothelial cells, are the primary targets for initiation of vascular
normalization. If vascular endothelium was the direct target of
inhibition, then Iressa treatment should have resulted in similar
effects in HT1080 tumors to those seen in Iressa-treated SQ20B
tumors. Tumor vasculature expresses EGFR, and EGFR inhibitors
can lead to antiangiogenic effects (34). However, the dose of EGFR
inhibitors that leads to such vascular effects is greater than the dose
used here. Consistent with these published studies, we have seen
antiangiogenic effects rather than vascular normalization in SQ20B
tumors at higher doses of Iressa (data not shown).
We did not detect any alterations in tumor growth or decreased
tumor cellularity after inhibitor treatment. Thus, reduced tumor
growth rates do not account for enhanced vasculature and
oxygenation. It is perhaps surprising that the tumor growth rates
were not higher in treated tumors due to increased tumor
vasculature and oxygenation. It is possible that the potential for
increased tumor growth due to increased blood supply was
countered by the antiproliferative effects of the signaling inhibitors.
However, these data raise the question of whether treatment of
tumors with low doses of signaling inhibitors as single agents might,
by increasing the effectiveness of the vasculature, lead to enhanced
tumor growth in the long term. Our results could indicate that these
agents need to be used in conjunction with cytotoxic agents or risk
enhancing the functionality of tumor vasculature.

These inhibitors can also alter tumor metabolism and
potentially affect tumor oxygen levels through this route. Tumor
vascular alterations might also result from alterations in oxygen
levels. Recently, Mazzone and colleagues showed evidence of
vascular normalization with increased tumor oxygenation, increased vascular flow, and increased pericyte coverage in tumors
grown in PHD2+/ mice (35). The decreased levels of endothelial
PDH2 in these mice was shown to increase HIF, resulting in the
up-regulation of soluble VEGFR-1 and VE-cadherin. This perturbation of the normal oxygen sensing mechanisms thereby
resulted in increased oxygenation in tumor grafts. If the
signaling inhibitors used in this study alter oxygen consumption,
they might also trigger a feedback loop leading to increased
oxygen levels and vascular normalization. The concept these
authors propose, that breaking the cycle of hypoxia-induced
angiogenic signaling can result in vascular normalization,
may be analogous to the mechanism we see, apart from the
target for inhibition. However, it is hard to see how selective
inhibition of PHD2 in the endothelium will be achieved clinically.
The selective inhibition of tumor signaling as shown here
with currently available drugs is a more clinically applicable
approach.
FTI and the proteosome inhibitor Nelfinavir have been shown to
radiosensitize tumor xenografts with synergy (26, 36). In addition
EGFR inhibition has been shown to radiosensitize (37), as has
inhibition of PI3K using PI-103 (23). Each of these inhibitors can
radiosensitize cells in tissue culture, but the effects in vivo have
often been of greater magnitude than the sensitization of tumor
cells in culture might predict. Here, we have begun to explore
mechanisms that could explain the effect that these drugs have on
the response of tumors to radiation.

a 5-d to 14-d time course. Xenograft tumors in
SCID mice were generated from SQ20B-GFP and
treated with the indicated inhibitors, as in Fig. 1. Each
time point represents a different cohort of mice.

Tumor Vascular Changes after Oncogenic Signaling Inhibition

Figure 5. Specific inhibition of PI3K in a transgenic
MMTV-neu model results in vascular normalization.
Female mice bearing the MMTV-neu transgene were
entered into the experiment when they had
developed tumors of 150 to 200 mm3 in volume.
After initial examination, the mice were treated with
PI-103 (5 mg/kg) for 10 d. All P values are from
two-tailed t tests compared with controls. *, P < 0.05.
A, representative images of hypoxia (EF5) staining
and three-dimensional reconstruction of Doppler
evaluation of breast carcinoma perfusion. Vascular
perfusion is increased, whereas hypoxia is reduced.
Quantitation of power Doppler signal from images
shows significant increase in vascular perfusion after
PI-103 treatment. B, at timed intervals before
sacrifice, CD31-PE (10 min) and dextran (1 min)
were injected i.v. Tumor vessel morphology was
examined as in Fig. 3. Quantitation shows an
increase in perfused vessel density and an increase
in dextran due to extravascular diffusion. Computergenerated vascular tracings and further quantitation
are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6.
C, evaluation and quantitation of vascular maturity
by immunohistochemical staining for SMA and
PDGF-h.

A strategy combining radiation with these signaling inhibitors
benefits not only from the decreased hypoxia but also from
the known ability of these antitumor signaling agents to sensitize
tumor cells to DNA damage (36, 38–40). Similarly, signaling
inhibition might be successfully combined with chemotherapeutic
interventions, as both perfusion and diffusion of small molecules
were markedly enhanced in treated tumors.
