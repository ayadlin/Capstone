Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a Food and Drug Administration–approved local cancer treatment that can be curative
of early disease and palliative in advanced disease. PDT of
murine tumors results in regimen-dependent induction of an
acute local inflammatory reaction, characterized in part by
rapid neutrophil infiltration into the treated tumor bed. In
this study, we show that a PDT regimen that induced a high
level of neutrophilic infiltrate generated tumor-specific
primary and memory CD8+ T-cell responses. In contrast,
immune cells isolated from mice treated with a PDT regimen
that induced little or no neutrophilic infiltrate exhibited
minimal antitumor immunity. Mice defective in neutrophil
homing to peripheral tissues (CXCR2 / mice) or mice
depleted of neutrophils were unable to mount strong
antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses following PDT. Neutrophils
seemed to be directly affecting T-cell proliferation and/or
survival rather than dendritic cell maturation or T-cell
migration. These novel findings indicate that by augmenting
T-cell proliferation and/or survival, tumor-infiltrating neutrophils play an essential role in establishment of antitumor
immunity following PDT. Furthermore, our results may
suggest a mechanism by which neutrophils might affect
antitumor immunity following other inflammation-inducing
cancer therapies. Our findings lay the foundation for the
rational design of PDT regimens that lead to optimal
enhancement of antitumor immunity in a clinical setting.
Immune-enhancing PDT regimens may then be combined with
treatments that result in optimal ablation of primary tumors,
thus inhibiting growth of primary tumor and controlling
disseminated disease. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10501–10]

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) destroys tumor tissue through
multiple, interacting mechanisms that include direct photodynamic cell kill, microvascular disruption, and inflammation (1). PDT is
traditionally used clinically as a local treatment, with little
consideration of its potential effects on disseminated disease.
Preclinical evidence suggests that PDT enhances systemic antitumor immunity although the mechanism of enhancement is
unclear (2). Innate immune cell presence and activation is critical
to the development of immunity (3), and innate cell infiltration
into the treated tumor bed is a hallmark of PDT (1). Our previous
data showed that the strong inflammatory response that
contributed substantially to local tumor control was dominated

by neutrophils (4). In this report, we explore the possibility that
neutrophils participate in the generation of antitumor immunity
following PDT.
Neutrophils, originally defined as Gr1+CD11b+ cells but now
generally classified as Gr1HiCD11b+F4/80 , actively participate in
the elicitation and coordination of immune responses to pathogens
in the mouse through (a) secretion of chemotactic signals that
recruit monocytes and immature dendritic cells (5), (b) activation
of dendritic cells via cell-to-cell contact and secretion of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-a (6, 7), and (c) stimulation of monocyte and
T-cell differentiation through secretion of IFN-g (5, 8). The role of
Gr1+CD11b+ cells in induction of antitumor immunity is less well
defined. Several recent studies have shown the presence of an
immunosuppressive cell population in tumor-bearing hosts that is
capable of promoting tumor angiogenesis and suppressing T-cell
responses and also expresses Gr1 and CD11b molecules (9–12).
However, mouse tumors genetically modified to express various
cytokines exhibited increased neutrophil infiltration into the tumor
bed, which was followed by enhanced T-cell infiltration and
subsequent tumor regression (13–15). Furthermore, depletion of
neutrophils reduced the number of CD8+ T cells infiltrating the
tumor and tumor regression was abrogated.
We recently reported that in murine tumor models, the degree of
neutrophilic infiltration can be controlled by the PDT regimen used
[i.e., the photosensitizer dose, light dose ( fluence), and light dose
rate ( fluence rate); ref. 4]. In particular, under low fluence rate
conditions, high fluence controls tumors through direct cell kill and
vascular disruption (f65% cure rate) but generates minimal
intratumor inflammatory response; in contrast, low-fluence
treatment maintains vascular integrity and induces a pronounced
inflammatory response (f20% cure rate). In this report, we have
used two PDT regimens differing in their ability to induce
neutrophilic infiltrate into the treated tumor bed as experimental
models to probe and elucidate the role played by neutrophils in the
stimulation of adaptive antitumor immunity following PDT.
Our findings show for the first time that induction of antitumor
immunity following PDT is dependent on neutrophil infiltration
into the treated tumor bed, and suggest that neutrophils may be
directly stimulating T-cell proliferation and/or survival. Consequently, the presence of high levels of neutrophilic infiltrate at
the primary treatment site may serve as a potential clinical
indicator of the development of systemic immunity, thus adding an
important component that might benefit the control of disseminated disease.

that recognizes the HA533-541 peptide presented on H-2Ld (16) were bred in
the Roswell Park Department of Laboratory Animal Resources. All mice
were female, of BALB/c background, and were housed in microisolator
cages in a laminar flow unit under ambient light. Six- to 10-week-old
animals were inoculated s.c. on the right shoulder with 106 Colo26 (murine
colon carcinoma) or Colo26 cells transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)
cDNA (Colo26-HA; ref. 17). I.v. challenge with tumor cells was done by
injection of exponentially growing Colo26 cells. The RPCI Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures carried out in this
study.
Reagents and antibodies. Clinical-grade, pyrogen-free 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a was obtained from the Roswell Park
Pharmacy and reconstituted to 0.4 mmol/L in pyrogen-free 5% dextrose in
water (D5W; Baxter Corp.). Rat anti-mouse Gr1 was purchased from
PharMingen and rat immunoglobulin G isotype control was from Sigma.
In vivo PDT treatment. Tumor-bearing mice were injected in the tail
vein with 0.4 Amol/kg of 2-[1-hexyloxyethyl]-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a,
followed 24 h later by illumination as previously described (4). A spot of
1.1 cm2 that contained the tumor was illuminated with 665-nm light
produced by a dye laser (375; Spectra Physics) pumped by an argon ion laser
(2080; Spectra Physics) to a total dose of 48 J/cm2 given at 7 mW/cm2 or 128
J/cm2 given at 14 mW/cm2. Control mice were treated with photosensitizer
alone or, in the case of tumor challenge and tests for immunologic memory,
with photosensitizer alone followed by surgical removal of tumors 24 h later.
Adoptive transfer of immune cells. Spleens and tumor draining lymph
nodes (TDLN) were harvested; single-cell suspensions were generated by
passage through a metallic mesh, RBC were lysed, and cells were plated for
at least 2 h in culture plates at 37jC for the depletion of the adherent
populations. The nonadherent lymphocytic population was collected,
washed, resuspended at 107 cell/mL, and injected i.v. (2  106 per mouse)
48 h before PDT treatment. SCID mice were reconstituted with 15  106
splenocytes. The isolation of CD8+ T cells from TDLN cell suspensions
was done by negative selection with MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec;
purity >95%).
Assessment of lung tumor growth. TDLN cells isolated from control or
PDT-treated mice (2  106 per mouse) were transferred to naı̈ve mice as
described above. Recipient mice were injected i.v. with exponentially
growing Colo26 cells; 18 days later, the presence of tumors was determined
by injection, via an incision in the trachea, of 1 mL of 15% India ink (diluted
in PBS). The lungs were removed from the rib cage, weighed, and placed in
Fekete’s fixative (61% ethanol, 3.2% formaldehyde, 4.1% acetic acid); lung
tumors were counted under a dissecting microscope (18).
Flow cytometry. Auxiliary TDLNs or tumors were harvested at the
indicated time points and single-cell suspensions were generated (19). Cells
were stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to detect specific
cell-surface antigens (CD8, CD11b, CD11c, CD25, CD40, CD44, CD45, CD69,
CD80, CD86, Gr1, and F4/80), as previously described (19). The mAbs were
directly conjugated with the following fluorochromes: fluorescein (FITC),
phycoerythrin, PerCPCy5.5, and allophycocyanin (all from PharMingen,
except F4/80, which was purchased from eBioscience). A tetramer of H-2Ld
complexed to the HA peptide HA533-541, which is recognized by the clone 4
CD8+ T cells conjugated to phycoerythrin, was provided by the NIH
Tetramer Facility, and staining was done as suggested by the provider. For
intracellular TNF-a staining, cells were permeabilized with a PBS solution
containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% saponin and incubated with
anti-TNF mAb (PharMingen) for 30 min on ice. A BD FACSCalibur was used
for flow cytometric analysis; data were acquired from 10,000 (tumorinfiltrating) or 50,000 (TDLN) cells stored in collateral list mode and
analyzed using the WinList processing program (Verity Software House,
Inc.). At least five mice per group were analyzed. For the determination of
the absolute number of specific cell populations, the percentage of each
population was multiplied by the number of cells recovered from the
respective TDLN.
ELISA for interleukin-6. Tumors were harvested 8 h following
treatment and processed as described (19). Protein concentration was
determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). ELISA kits
specific for interleukin-6 were purchased from R&D Systems and used

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At least five mice per group
were included.
ELISPOT assay for IFN-;. BALB/c mice bearing Colo26 tumors were
treated with PDT and rested for more than 60 days. Splenocytes from
tumor-free mice were examined for tumor responsiveness by ELISPOT
assays against irradiated cells pulsed with the tumor-associated antigen AH
(the endogenous Colo26 peptide derived from the murine Leukemia virus
gp70; ref. 20) or an irrelevant antigen, PA1 (5 Ag/mL of each peptide). The
number of spot-forming units in each well was enumerated by computerassisted image analysis using the Zeiss ELISPOT reader system equipped
with v 4.1.56 software (Zeiss) by the Roswell Park Cancer Center
Immunomonitoring Core facility. The ELISPOT assay was conducted as
previously described (21).
In vivo cytotoxicity assay. In vivo cytotoxic assays were done as
previously described (22). Briefly, TDLNs were harvested from treated mice
2 days post-PDT and adoptively transferred into naı̈ve BALB/c hosts. Target
cells were prepared from naı̈ve mice by labeling a single-cell suspension
with PKH26 dye (Sigma) for 4 min at 2 Amol/L according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting red population was separated
in two equal fractions, one of which was labeled with 0.1 Amol/L
carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (referred to as CFSE;
Molecular Probes) and the other with 1 Amol/L CFSE for 2 min. The lower
intensity labeled fraction was pulsed for 1.5 h with an irrelevant peptide PA1
(23); the high intensity labeled fraction was pulsed with the Colo26-specific
peptide AH1 (20). Equal cell numbers from both populations were admixed
and injected into recipient mice. Twenty-four hours later, peripheral blood
was collected, RBC were lysed, and cells were fixed and then run on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Specific cytotoxicity was calculated according
to the formula [1 (% AH1 cells/% positive PA1 cells)]  100%.
Gr1+ cell depletion. Depletion of Gr1+ cells was achieved using anti-Gr1
antibodies (100 Ag/mouse i.p.) administered 24 h before treatment and
immediately after PDT treatment. Control animals were injected as above
with the appropriate isotype. The depletion of the tumor-infiltrating Gr1+
cell population was confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown).
In vivo T-cell proliferation. Splenocytes were harvested from clone 4
mice, RBC were lysed, and the resulting cell populations were plated for at
least 2 h in culture plates at 37jC for the depletion of the adherent
populations. The resulting cell populations were washed and resuspended in
HBSS at a concentration of 107/mL. Cells were stained with CFSE at a
concentration of 5 Amol/L for 4 min and then washed once with fetal bovine
serum and thrice with complete medium. Cells were counted and 2  106
CFSE cells were adoptively transferred into BALB/c mice bearing Colo26-HA
tumors. Seven days after PDT treatment, regrowing tumors were harvested,
digested with collagenase, and the resulting single-cell suspensions were
stained for flow. The percentage of CFSElo cells was determined between
groups by gating on cells that were CD3+CD8+tet-HA+ and had diluted their
CFSE dye. For cell analysis, at least 500,000 events per animal were collected.
Statistical evaluation. All measured values are presented as mean F SE.
Student’s t test with Welch’s correction was used for comparison between
groups in all of the experiments. The term ‘‘significant’’ in the text
represents a P value of V0.05.

Results
Induction of antitumor immunity by PDT is regimen
dependent and correlates with induction of acute local
inflammation. Figure 1A shows the effect of tumor exposure to
high-fluence (128 J/cm2) and low-fluence (48 J/cm2) PDT on
neutrophilic (Gr1HiCD11b+) infiltrate into the post-PDT tumor bed
for Colo26 and Colo26 transfected with the HA antigen (Colo26HA) tumors. The data are consistent with our earlier work (4) in
that low-fluence PDT resulted in significantly higher numbers of
infiltrating Gr1HiCD11b+ cells than high-fluence PDT in both
Colo26 and Colo26-HA tumors. Further phenotypic analysis of
the infiltrating cell population showed that fewer than 10% of
the Gr1HiCD11b+ cells that infiltrate the tumor bed following

Figure 1. PDT induces acute local
inflammation. A, BALB/c mice bearing
Colo26 (open columns) or Colo26-HA
(hatched columns ) tumors were subjected
to low-fluence (48 J/cm2) or high-fluence
(128 J/cm2) PDT. Tumors were harvested
8 h post-PDT and single-cell suspensions
were generated and analyzed by flow
cytometry for the presence of Gr1HiCD11b+
cells as described in Materials and
Methods. Results are expressed as the
number of Gr1HiCD11b+ cells per milligram
of tumor tissue. Five mice per group were
included and the experiment was repeated
twice. One representative experiment is
shown; bars, SE. *, P < 0.04, compared
with high-fluence PDT. B, BALB/c mice
bearing Colo26 tumors were subjected to
low-dose PDT; tumors were isolated 8 h
later and single-cell suspensions were
generated and examined by flow cytometry
for expression of CD45, Gr1, CD11b, and
F4/80. Representative histograms are
shown in which CD45+CD11b+ cells were
gated for either high or low expression of
Gr1 (left ) and examined for expression
of F4/80 (right ). Open histograms in the
single color histograms show F4/80
reactivity; closed histograms represent
staining with an isotype matched control.
C, BALB/c mice bearing Colo26 tumors
were subjected to high or low local
inflammation PDT treatment; control mice
were injected with photosensitizer and,
18 h later, instead of light treatment, tumors
were removed surgically. TDLNs were
harvested 2 d posttreatment and adoptively
transferred into naı̈ve BALB/c mice.
Recipient mice were challenged with 105
Colo26 cells i.v.; 18 d later, lungs were
harvested and weighed. D, SCID mice
were reconstituted with 15  106 adherent
depleted splenocytes isolated from cured
mice 60 d after treatment. Recipient mice
were challenged and lungs were harvested
and weighed as in C . Symbols, individual

low-fluence PDT express the monocyte/macrophage marker F4/80,
whereas CD11b+ cells that express low levels of Gr1 are >70%
F4/80+; Gr1Lo expressing cells make up <20% of the total Gr1expressing cells (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that neutrophils
dominate the tumor infiltrate following PDT.
To test the hypothesis that induction of acute local inflammation
by PDT resulted in enhanced antitumor immunity, Colo26 tumor–
bearing mice were treated with low-fluence PDT (hereafter referred
to as high-inflammation PDT), high-fluence PDT (hereafter referred
to as low-inflammation PDT), or photosensitizer alone (control).
Auxiliary TDLN were harvested from treated and control mice
2 days after PDT and adoptively transferred into naı̈ve BALB/c
mice. Recipient mice were challenged by injection with 105 Colo26
cells i.v. to induce lung tumors; 18 days later, lungs were harvested
and weighed (Fig. 1C). In a nonimmune mouse, tumor cells
establish colonies in the lung, which results in increased lung
weight. An immune mouse will eliminate most of the tumor cells,
resulting in fewer colonies, which will be reflected in a reduced
lung weight as compared with a nonimmune mouse. Naı̈ve non–
tumor-bearing animals have lungs weighing f450 mg (data
not shown). Lungs harvested from recipient mice receiving TDLN
cells isolated from mice 2 days after high-inflammation PDT
weighed less than lungs of mice receiving TDLN cells from lowinflammation PDT–treated mice. Both conditions yielded signifi-

cantly lighter lungs than mice receiving TDLN cells from control
mice whose tumors were surgically removed 24 h following
photosensitizer injection, thus suggesting that both PDT regimens
result in enhanced primary antitumor immune response.
To determine whether the observed antitumor immune response
was durable, the ability of splenocytes isolated from mice whose
tumors were ablated by PDT or surgically removed to confer tumor
protection was evaluated 60 days posttreatment by SCID reconstitution experiments (Fig. 1D). SCID mice received 15  106
splenocytes from the respective groups and challenged with an
i.v. injection of a tumorigenic dose of Colo26 cells. Splenocytes
isolated from mice cured with high-inflammation PDT were able to
control lung tumor growth significantly better than splenocytes
isolated from mice whose tumors were cured by low-inflammation
PDT or were surgically removed. Splenocytes isolated from mice
whose tumors were cured by low-inflammation PDT did not
control lung tumor growth. Thus, it seems that immune cells
isolated from low-inflammation PDT are able to mount a primary
immune response (Fig. 1C) but not a memory immune response
(Fig. 1D), and that induction of acute local inflammation by highinflammation PDT leads to establishment of antitumor memory.
Induction of acute local inflammation results in increased
numbers of activated tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. PDTenhanced antitumor immunity has previously been attributed to

Figure 2. Enhanced numbers of activated tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in TDLNs of mice following induction of acute local inflammation. BALB/c mice bearing
Colo26-HA (A–C) or Colo26 (D ) tumors were subjected to PDT treatments, causing different levels of acute inflammation, or injected with the photosensitizer and not
exposed to laser treatment (Control ). Twenty-four hours later, TDLN were harvested, single-cell suspensions generated, and the phenotype of CD8+ T cells specific
for the HA antigen (tet+) was determined. A, flow cytometry depicting staining for tet-HA, CD8, CD44, and CD69. The boxed area in the first column identifies the

D, TDLNs were harvested at 24 h posttreatment and single-cell suspensions were generated. The number of cells able to specifically recognize tumor antigen
AH1 and secrete IFN-g as a consequence was determined with ELISPOT assays. Nonspecific staining with an irrelevant peptide (PA1) was subtracted from each
group. Columns, average number of IFN-g+ cells (each group contains at least six mice per group); bars, SE. *, P < 0.01, compared with low-inflammation PDT.

the presence of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (24, 25); CD8+ T cell–
depleted TDLN cells isolated from mice exposed to highinflammation PDT were unable to transfer antitumor immunity
(data not shown). Therefore, we determined whether induction of
acute local inflammation was accompanied by changes in the
number and/or function of primary immune effector CD8+ T cells.
Because the numbers of endogenous tumor-specific T cells were
below detectable levels in the parental tumor model (26), we
availed ourselves of a mouse strain, clone 4 (16), which bears T cells
transgenic for a T-cell receptor that recognizes the HA533-541
peptide presented on H-2Ld molecules. Naı̈ve transgenic CD8+
T cells were isolated from clone 4 mice and adoptively transferred
(2  106 cells) into BALB/c mice bearing Colo26-HA tumors.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

Tumors of the recipient mice were subjected to PDT and TDLN
cells were isolated 1 day later. Colo26-HA tumor–bearing mice
injected with photosensitizer but not exposed to light were used as
controls. Tumor-specific effector T cells were identified as being
tet-HA+CD8+CD44hi. Activated tumor-specific effector T cells
were defined by the presence of the early activation antigen
CD69 (tet-HA+CD8+CD44+CD69+). Figure 2A depicts representative
flow cytometry panels identifying tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell
effectors. The percentage of tumor-specific effector T cells present
in the TDLNs was similar among the groups (Fig. 2B, left),
suggesting that the adoptively transferred clone 4 T cells were
recruited to these lymph nodes equally. However, TDLNs recovered
from mice treated with high-inflammation PDT were highly

enlarged and harbored significantly more cells than TDLNs isolated
from either mice treated with low-inflammation PDT or control
mice treated with photosensitizer alone (Fig. 2B, right). The
increase in cell number following treatment with high-inflammation PDT was accompanied by a significant increase in both the
frequency (tet-HA+CD8+CD44+CD69+; 40 cells/50,000 for highinflammation versus f20 cells/50,000 for the low inflammation
and control groups) and the number of activated effector cells
present in TDLNs as compared with the other groups (control;
Fig. 2C, left). The same trend was observed when activated effector
tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (tet-HA+CD8+CD44+) were defined by
the expression of a second activation marker, CD25; more effector
cells expressed CD25 following induction of acute local inflammation (Fig. 2C, right). In addition, more TDLN immune cells isolated
from mice following induction of acute local inflammation by
treatment with high-inflammation PDT secreted IFN-g in response
to cells pulsed with AH1 peptide derived from the endogenous
Colo26 tumor antigen gp70 (20) than TDLN cells isolated from
mice treated with low-inflammation PDT or control mice (Fig. 2D).
Furthermore, spleens isolated 60 days after treatment from mice

cured with high-inflammation PDT contained significantly more
tumor-specific IFN-g–secreting immune cells (65.18 F 12.35/106
spleen cells) than those from mice either cured with lowinflammation–induced PDT treatment (16.98 F 5.16/106 spleen
cells) or had their tumors surgically removed (27.05 F 11.21/106
spleen cells). Thus, it seems that more tumor-specific activated
effector T cells were generated following induction of acute local
inflammation at the tumor site and that this resulted in a larger
pool of tumor-specific immune memory cells.
Neutrophils regulate enhancement of tumor-specific T cells
by high-inflammation PDT. Previous studies have shown that
neutrophils play a role in establishment of pathogen-specific,
T-cell–dependent immune responses (27, 28). Consequently, the
effect of depletion of neutrophils on T-cell activation and function
after PDT was examined by the administration of anti-Gr1
depleting antibodies. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with either
anti-Gr1 or isotype antibodies followed by treatment with highinflammation PDT, and the number of tumor-specific CD8+ effector
T cells was determined with flow cytometry 1 day post-PDT. The
absolute number of tumor-specific CD8+ effector T cells was

significantly decreased in the absence of Gr1+ cells (Fig. 3A). The
number of tumor-specific T cells present in the treated tumor 7
days after high-inflammation PDT was also significantly decreased
in the absence of Gr1+ cells (Fig. 3B). Our previous studies have
shown that treatment with anti-Gr1 antibodies significantly
reduces tumor response to high-inflammation PDT (4).
The function of TDLN immune cells following induction of acute
local inflammation by PDT in mice depleted of Gr1+ cells was
determined using in vivo cytotoxic assays against the endogenous
Colo26 antigen AH1 (Fig. 3C). The cytotoxic ability of TDLN cells
from mice depleted of Gr1+ cells was significantly reduced in
comparison with isotype-treated mice, which is likely a reflection of
the reduced number of effector cells present following anti-Gr1
treatment.
Gr1 is expressed on neutrophils, macrophages, plasmacytoid
dendritic cells, and memory T cells (29–31); therefore, the results
reported above could reflect the effect of depletion of populations
other than neutrophils that are involved in T-cell activation. To
address these issues, the activation state of tumor-specific T cells
following treatment of Colo26-HA tumors with high-inflammation
PDT was examined in mice lacking the chemokine receptor CXCR2,
which is required for neutrophil migration into tissue. Mice lacking
CXCR2 (CXCR2 / ) have intact Gr1+ populations (32) and normal
monocyte/macrophage, T-cell (32, 33), and dendritic cell (34)
migration, but impaired neutrophil migration to peripheral sites
including the tumor (32, 33). The basal level of neutrophils present
in Colo26-HA tumors of CXCR2 / mice was significantly less than
in BALB/c mice (Fig. 4A) and did not increase significantly after
PDT treatment.

Phenotypic analysis of the CD8+ tumor-specific effector T-cell
population isolated from TDLNs indicated that this population was
significantly reduced in CXCR2 / mice following treatment with
high-inflammation PDT as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4B).
Thus, it seems that neutrophils play a critical role in the
enhancement of tumor-specific immunity following tumor treatment with high-inflammation PDT.
Neutrophils gain access to the TDLN following highinflammation PDT but do not influence dendritic cell
maturation. Neutrophils have been shown to capture live bacteria
from the skin on intradermal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
vaccination and shuttle them to the draining lymph nodes (35). To
determine whether neutrophils were present in TDLNs following
high-inflammation PDT, TDLN cells were harvested from Colo26
tumor–bearing mice following high-inflammation PDT and analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of Gr1, CD11b, and F4/
80 (Fig. 5A). A small proportion of the Gr1HiCD11b+ population
expressed F4/80, whereas cells that expressed lower levels of Gr1
strongly reacted with F4/80 and most likely represented monocyte/
macrophage populations. Because activated T cells and some
memory T cells also express Gr1, we further analyzed the
Gr1 Hi CD11b + population for expression of CD3 and CD8.
Approximately 2% of the Gr1HiCD11b+ cells expressed CD3 and
CD8 (data not shown). Thus, it seems that the majority of the
Gr1HiCD11b+ cells in the TDLN were neutrophils and that
neutrophils gained access to the TDLN following PDT. Kinetic
analysis of neutrophilic infiltration of TDLNs revealed that PDT
significantly increased the number of Gr1HiCD11b+F4/80 cells
present in the TDLN 8, 24, and 48 h following treatment (Fig. 5B).

absolute number of CD11c+CD40+ cells per TDLN; bars, SE. Experiments were repeated twice with five mice per group. *, P < 0.02, compared with control.

Neutrophils have been shown to drive dendritic cell maturation
by licensing through TNF-a (6), and we have shown that PDT
treatment results in increased activation of antigen-presenting
cells, including dendritic cells (36). It is possible that neutrophils
regulate tumor-specific T cells following PDT indirectly by
interacting with dendritic cells. To test this hypothesis, we first
examined the effect of PDT on expression of TNF-a by neutrophils.
Intracellular staining for TNF-a revealed that more neutrophils in
the TDLN express TNF-a 48 h following high-inflammation PDT
(Fig. 5C). These results suggest that following high-inflammation
PDT, neutrophils have the potential to drive dendritic cell
maturation, which could result in increased T-cell activation.
Therefore, we examined the phenotype of dendritic cells in the
TDLNs of animals treated 48 h prior with high-inflammation
PDT in the absence or presence of neutrophils. Dendritic cells
were identified by expression of CD11c; mature dendritic cells
express increased levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II
molecules (IAd). Depletion of Gr1+ cells had no effect on the
number of CD11c+CD40+ (Fig. 5D), CD11c+CD80+, CD11c+CD86+,

or CD11c+IAd+ dendritic cells (data not shown). These results
suggest that neutrophils do not exert their immunomodulating role
via licensing of dendritic cells following high-inflammation PDT.
Neutrophils are critical to the expansion of tumor-specific
T cells following high-inflammation PDT. The cellularity of
the TDLNs was significantly decreased in CXCR2 / mice (Fig. 6A)
and in mice depleted of Gr1+ cells following high-inflammation
PDT (Fig. 6B). To determine if the decrease in cellularity was
accompanied by a decrease in T-cell proliferation, clone 4 T cells
were labeled with CFSE before their adoptive transfer into Colo26HA tumor–bearing Gr1+ depleted or isotype control mice. Mice
were treated with high-inflammation PDT and the degree of tumorspecific (tet-HA+CD3+CD8+) T-cell proliferation in the treated
tumor bed was determined 7 days after PDT. The decrease in
cellularity in the absence of neutrophils corresponded to a
significant decrease in T-cell proliferation following high-inflammation PDT of mice depleted of Gr1+ cells (Fig. 6C). These results
suggest that neutrophils contribute to either effector T-cell
proliferation or survival.

Discussion
In this study, we have examined the effect of neutrophils on
enhancement of antitumor immunity by PDT. We used two PDT
regimens that differ in their ability to induce neutrophilic
infiltration into the treated tumor bed and reported that neutrophil
migration into the tumor bed enhanced the magnitude of the
tumor-specific primary immune response as well as the establishment of memory antitumor immune responses. Neutrophils
regulated the number of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in the TDLN
and affected the number of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and the
degree of T-cell proliferation at the tumor site, but seemed to have
no effect on dendritic cell maturation or T-cell migration. This
suggests that neutrophils directly influence T-cell proliferation
and/or survival following PDT. To our knowledge, this is the first
report to identify tumor-infiltrating neutrophils as being critical to
the enhancement of tumor-specific T cells and the generation of
antitumor immunity following PDT. In addition, our data suggest
that neutrophils can contribute to the induction of antitumor
immunity by other modalities through direct interaction with
tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.
Our study used the anti-Gr1 RB6-8C5 antibody to deplete
neutrophils, which is a well-established procedure (15, 27, 37).
However, Gr1 is also expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and
macrophages (29, 30), which are well-characterized stimulators of
T cells. However, depletion with anti-Gr1 antibody did not
affect the number of CD11c cells present in TDLNs following
PDT (Fig. 5D), whereas use of CXCR2 / mice, which exhibit
impaired neutrophil migration but normal monocyte/macrophage
and dendritic cell migration (33, 34), produced similar results to
those observed following depletion of Gr1+ cells, supporting our
conclusion that neutrophils play a critical role in enhancement of
CD8+ T-cell activation by PDT.
Neutrophil-CD8+ T-cell cross talk has previously been correlated
with the induction of antitumor and pathogen specific immunity
(15, 27, 28, 38, 39). A predominant mechanism involves neutrophildendritic cell interaction, with an important role assigned to TNF-a
expressed on neutrophils, which can increase dendritic cell acti-

vation. Because the phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells
following PDT is not affected by the administration of anti-Gr1
antibodies (Fig. 5), then neutrophils seem to affect CD8+ T cell–
mediated antitumor immunity following PDT by other means.
However, it is possible that neutrophil depletion affects dendritic
cell function, which was not examined in the current study.
Neutrophils have also been shown to indirectly affect T-cell
trafficking through the accessory function of activated monocytes
(39) and through expression of chemotactic factors that regulate
T-cell migration (5, 40). Depletion of Gr1+ cells before highinflammation PDT reduced the frequency of tumor-specific T cells
present in TDLNs, implicating these cells in regulation of T-cell
migration. However, memory T cells express Gr1 (31), and it is
possible that the reduction in frequency is due to direct elimination
of this subset of T cells. CXCR2 / mice do not have impaired
T-cell migration (41, 42) and the frequency of tumor-specific CD8+
T cells was similar in wild-type and CXCR2 / mice following highinflammation PDT, suggesting that neutrophils are not affecting
T-cell migration following PDT. Little is known about the effect of
PDT on T-cell trafficking, and more direct analysis of this and the
effect of neutrophils on T-cell trafficking following PDT is needed
before a role for neutrophils in regulating T-cell trafficking can be
determined.
Our study indicates a direct role for neutrophils in T-cell
proliferation because fewer proliferating tumor-specific T cells
were present in the tumor bed following PDT in the absence of
neutrophils (Fig. 6). Neutrophils have been shown to sustain
pathogenic CD8+ T cells in the heart (43) and to affect T-cell
activation and proliferation in inflammatory setting through
expression of MHC class II molecules (44, 45). PDT also stimulates
MHC class II molecule expression by neutrophils (46), suggesting
that neutrophils have the potential to directly affect T-cell
proliferation following PDT. This possibility is supported by the
presence of neutrophils in the TDLN following PDT because this is
the major site of tumor-specific T-cell activation and proliferation.
Neutrophils lack expression of CC chemokine receptor 7 and do
not seem to have access into lymph nodes; however, a recent report

Figure 6. Neutrophil depletion affects the proliferative ability of tumor-specific T cells following PDT treatment. A, CXCR2 / or BALB/c mice bearing Colo26-HA
tumors were subjected to high-inflammation PDT and, 24 h later, TDLNs were harvested, single-cell suspensions were generated, and the number of live cells was
determined. Columns, average number of cells present; bars, SE. Each experiment was repeated twice and contained a minimum of five mice per group. *, P < 0.002,
compared with wild-type mice. B, BALB/c mice bearing Colo26-HA tumors were injected with anti-Gr1 or isotype control antibodies before high-inflammation PDT.
Twenty-four hours following PDT, TDLNs were harvested, single-cell suspensions were generated, and the number of live cells was determined. Columns, average
number of cells present; bars, SE. Each experiment was repeated twice and contained a minimum of five mice per group. *, P < 0.05, compared with isotype control.
C, BALB/c mice bearing Colo26-HA were injected with anti-Gr1 or isotype control antibodies before PDT treatment. All mice also received CFSE-labeled clone 4
splenocytes. Tumors were harvested 7 d after PDT treatment, single-cell suspensions were generated, and the percentage of CD3+CD8+tet-HA+ cells that were CFSElo
was determined. Pooled data from 20 mice are shown. *, P < 0.004, compared with isotype-treated mice.

from Abadie et al. (35) showed that neutrophils migrate into
draining lymph nodes via the lymphatics following Mycobacterium
bovis BCG vaccination. Thus, it is possible that PDT-induced
inflammation enables neutrophils to access TDLNs. It is also
possible that given the small size of the animal model, PDT of mice
results in photodamage of the nearby TDLNs, which allows
unregulated cell migration into these nodes. However, the dose of
PDT used to induce high inflammation is relatively low and we
have not observed damage to TDLNs following this treatment
regimen.
Cancer survival rates decrease in the presence of metastases,1
and there is increased interest in generation of therapies capable
of enhancing antitumor immunity. We have recently shown that
local PDT of primary murine tumors can control the growth of
tumors outside the treatment field (25). Furthermore, data from
our laboratory indicate that aminolevulinic acid PDT of basal cell
carcinoma enhanced tumor-specific immune responses in
patients.2 It is well established that clinical PDT results in
inflammatory responses (1), but the degree of neutrophilic
infiltration is unknown (47, 48). The results presented here indicate

that an examination of the local tissue response following clinical
PDT is warranted.
It should be noted that the high-inflammation PDT regimen
used in the current study resulted in minimal tumor growth control
at the primary treatment site; low-inflammation PDT was highly
effective at controlling primary tumor growth but did not result in
durable immune responses. Our findings suggest that combination
PDT regimens composed of treatments resulting in optimal
induction of antitumor immunity followed by treatments leading
to ablation of the primary tumor should be considered. PDT
regimens that induce antitumor immunity could also be used in an
adjuvant setting with other local treatments, such as surgery, which
is effective at controlling primary tumors but has no effect on
disseminated disease. Thus, PDT regimens capable of inducing
antitumor immunity can be rationally designed, which has the
potential to expand the use of this treatment modality.
