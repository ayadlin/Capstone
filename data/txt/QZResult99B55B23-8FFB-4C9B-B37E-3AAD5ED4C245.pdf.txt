ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal brain tumor. Tumor relapse in
GBM is inevitable despite maximal therapeutic interventions. Glioma stem cells (GSCs)
have been found to be critical players in therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence.
Therapeutic drugs targeting GSCs may significantly improve GBM treatment. In this
study, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) effectively disrupted GSCs
and inhibited tumor growth in the GSC-derived orthotopic xenografts by targeting
the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML). As2O3 treatment induced rapid degradation of
PML protein along with severe apoptosis in GSCs. Disruption of the endogenous
PML recapitulated the inhibitory effects of As2O3 treatment on GSCs both in vitro
and in orthotopic tumors. Importantly, As2O3 treatment dramatically reduced GSC
population in the intracranial GBM xenografts and increased the survival of mice
bearing the tumors. In addition, As2O3 treatment preferentially inhibited cell growth
of GSCs but not matched non-stem tumor cells (NSTCs). Furthermore, As2O3 treatment
or PML disruption potently diminished c-Myc protein levels through increased
poly-ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of c-Myc. Our study indicated a
potential implication of As2O3 in GBM treatment and highlighted the important role of
PML/c-Myc axis in the maintenance of GSCs.

hierarchy of glioma cells, GSCs have the capacities
to self-renew, differentiate, and recapitulate the whole
tumor [8]. GSCs showed potent tumor formation
ability in immunocompromised mice [2, 3]. GSCs are
also more resistant to irradiation relative to matched
non-stem tumor cells (NSTCs) [3, 9, 10]. An increase
of GSC population was observed in vivo after chemoradiation treatment, further supporting the involvement
of GSCs in therapeutic resistance and the resultant tumor
relapse [3,  11–13]. In addition, GSCs promote tumor
angiogenesis, pericyte derivation, cancer invasion, and
immune evasion, all contributing to the treatment failure
[6, 14–17]. Therefore, efficient elimination of the GSC
population is a critical step to achieve successful GBM
treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), classified as the
grade IV astrocytoma, is the most lethal and common
type of primary brain tumor. With a crude annual
incidence of 3 per 100,000 individuals, GBM predicts
a median survival of less than 16 months associated
with very poor life quality [1]. Despite aggressive
therapies including surgical resection, radiation and
chemotherapy, tumor relapse is a common event in
GBM patients [1]. Recent studies indicate that a subset
of GBM tumor cells with stem cell-like properties,
named glioma stem cells (GSCs), play a critical role in
therapeutic resistance, tumor recurrence and malignant
progression [2–7]. At the apex of the differentiation

Multiple drugs have been applied in GBM treatment,
but most of them generate only mild and temporary
beneficial outcomes. Addition of Temozolomide (TMZ) to
ionic irradiation (IR) statistically improves the prognosis
of newly diagnosed GBM patients, but the overall survival
rate after treatment is still very poor [18]. The limited
effect of TMZ treatment can largely be ascribed to the
GSC population. Genetic depletion of the Nestin-positive
GSCs restored the response of GBM tumors to TMZ in the
genetically engineered mouse model [7]. In fact, exposure
to TMZ resulted in expansion of GSC population either by
selective amplification of GSCs or by phenotypic shift of
non-stem tumor cells to a GSC-like state [19]. In addition,
the anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody bevacizumab
targeting tumor vascularization has a transient inhibition
on GBM tumor growth, but the effect is greatly attenuated
in the GSC population due to the VEGFR2-Neuropilin-1
autocrine loop [20]. Furthermore, inhibition of vessel
formation will cause hypoxia which in the long run
will facilitate GSC maintenance or expansion [21–23].
Although numerous efforts have been put in exploration
of new drugs targeting GSCs to control GBM tumors, so
far no obvious advance has been made.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is a small molecular drug
approved by FDA for leukemia treatment [24]. During
the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL),
the PML-RARα fusion protein has been demonstrated to
underlie the abnormal transcription and the consequent
rapid growth of tumor cells [25]. Administration of
As2O3 in leukemia induces the ubiquitination-mediated
degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein via
multiple pathways and manifests substantial therapeutic
effects [26–29]. Furthermore, elimination of PML-RARα
by As2O3 treatment clears leukemia-initiating cells in
mouse APL, suggesting the potential of As2O3 in targeting
cancer stem cells [30]. So far, no PML-RARα mutant
has been reported in GBM. However, recent studies
demonstrated that the As2O3 target PML itself plays a
critical role in the maintenance of leukemia initiating
cells in chronic myeloid leukemia [31]. This discovery
indicates the potential application of As2O3 in treating
other cancers such as GBM bearing cancer stem cells. In
fact, preliminary studies suggested the inhibitory effect of
As2O3 on in vitro cultured glioma tumour-spheres [32],
but the consequences of As2O3 administration on GSCderived GBMs in vivo as well as the underlying molecular
mechanisms remained largely unknown.
Inspired by the new breakthrough in targeting
cancer stem cells by As2O3 in several types of leukemia
[30, 31], we examined the effect of As2O3 on GSCs in
vitro and in GSC-derived xenografts. As2O3 treatment
showed a dramatic inhibition on GSC growth in culture
and tumor progression in GBM xenografts. Moreover,
As2O3 treatment diminished PML protein in GSCs.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Consistently, knockdown of PML had similar outcomes
as As2O3 treatment, suggesting that As2O3 targets GSCs
via degradation of PML protein. In contrast, As2O3
treatment displayed negligible effect on non-stem glioma
cells. Finally, we found that c-Myc is one of the key
downstream effectors in response to the As2O3-mediated
PML degradation in GSCs. Our findings indicate that
ablation of cancer stem cells in GBM by As2O3 treatment
may have therapeutic potential and clinical implication in
the control of this lethal cancer.

RESULTS
As2O3 treatment inhibited GSC sphere formation
and tumor growth
To examine the putative effect of As2O3 treatment
on GSCs in vitro, we performed the tumorsphere
formation assays with GSCs isolated from GBM
surgical specimens or xenografts. Sorted GSCs (T4121
or T387) were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with
various doses of As2O3. Treatment with As2O3 (1–4 μM)
effectively inhibited GSC sphere formation and caused
a significant  decrease both  in sphere size and number
(Figure 1A–1C). In detail, treatment of GSCs with As2O3
at 2 μM resulted in loss  of 50–70% spheres and the
treatment with 4 μM As2O3 markedly inhibited GSC sphere
formation (Figure 1A–1C). Even at the dosage of 0.5 μM,
the effect of As2O3 treatment was very significant with a
50% decrease on sphere size (Figure 1C). Consistently,
cell titer assay confirmed that As2O3 treatment (1–4 μM)
significantly suppressed GSC growth in vitro (data not
shown). Thus, As2O3 treatment has potent inhibitory effect
on GSC tumorsphere formation and growth in vitro.
We then examined the impact of As2O3
administration on tumor growth of the GSC-derived
orthotopic xenografts. Mice bearing GBM xenografts
derived from luciferase-expressing GSCs (T387) were
treated with As2O3 (5 μg/g) [33, 34] or vehicle control
daily from the fourth day after GSC implantation. In vivo
tumor growth after treatment was determined by the
luciferase activity in tumors at indicated time points.
While the initiating tumor sizes were similar at Day 4 after
GSC implantation, the delayed tumor growth was detected
in the As2O3-treated group, which was represented by
the significant less luciferase signal in mouse brains in
As2O3-treated mice than control mice at Day 10 and
Day 18 (Figure 1D and 1E). As a result of the inhibited
tumor growth, mice treated with As2O3 also displayed a
significantly extended survival relative to the control mice
(Figure 1F). These data demonstrate that As2O3 treatment
significantly inhibited tumor growth of GSC-derived
xenografts and increased survival of animals bearing the
GBM xenografts.

As2O3 treatment reduced PML protein and
promoted apoptosis in GSCs

Supplementary Figure S1C). Staining of the apoptotic
marker Annexin V confirmed the occurrence of massive
apoptosis in GSCs two days after infection of shPML
viruses (Figure 3E and 3F), suggesting that increased
GSC cell death may be a result of apoptosis induced by
PML disruption. Furthermore, disruption of PML by the
shRNAs severely impaired tumor growth of the GSCderived xenografts (Figure 4A). As a consequence, mice
bearing the GSC-derived xenografts expressing shPML
had a significantly extended survival relative to the
control group (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure S1D).
Taken together, PML disruption resulted in increased
apoptosis and reduced tumorigenic capacity of GSCs,
which recapitulates the effects of As2O3 treatment in vitro
and in vivo.

Previous reports demonstrated that As2O3 treatment
triggered an immediate downregulation of PML [26, 27],
therefore we explored the dynamic of PML protein in
GSCs in response to As2O3 treatment. A time course study
showed that As2O3 treatment induced a gradual loss of
PML protein in T387 and T4121 GSCs (Figure 2A and 2B,
top panels). Meanwhile, the cleaved PARP, an apoptotic
marker, increased along with the PML reduction during
the course of As2O3 treatment (Figure 2A and 2B, middle
panels), suggesting the induction of GSC apoptosis by
As2O3 treatment. This result was further confirmed by
immunofluorescent staining of another apoptotic marker,
the cleaved Caspase-3. As shown in Figure 2C, As2O3
treatment resulted in an increase of the cleaved Caspase-3
along with a gradual decrease of PML protein levels.
These data indicate that induction of GSC apoptosis may
underlie the inhibited cell growth after As2O3 treatment. As
As2O3 treatment in vivo inhibited GSC tumor growth, we
further examined the effect of As2O3 on PML protein and
apoptosis in GSC-derived xenografts. Immunofluorescent
staining demonstrated a significant decrease of PML
signals accompanied by an increase of the cleaved
Caspase-3 staining in the As2O3-treated xenografts relative
to the control xenografts (Figure 2D and 2E). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that As2O3 treatment reduced PML
protein and induces apoptotic cell death in vitro and in
GSC-derived xenografts.

As2O3 treatment reduced GSC population in
GBM xenografts
As As2O3 treatment mimics PML disruption to
induce GSC apoptosis in vitro, we further investigated
the effect of As2O3 treatment on GSC population in
GSC-derived xenografts. Immunofluorescent staining
of GSC markers SOX2 and OLIG2 demonstrated that
As2O3 treatment dramatically reduced GSC population
in the T387 and T4121 GSC-derived xenografts
(Figure 5A–5D, Supplementary Figure S2A–S2D).
GSCs express high levels of the angiogenic factor
VEGF to promote tumor angiogenesis [16, 35], and
As2O3-induced GSC disruption in the orthotopic tumors
is supposed to influence the tumor vascularization.
We next examined whether As2O3-induced reduction
of GSCs impacts vessel density in GBM xenografts.
Immunofluorescent staining of the vessel endothelial
cell marker Glut1 indicated that As2O3 treatment
significantly reduced vessel density in GSC-derived
xenografts (Figure 5E and 5F). Thus, As2O3 treatment
reduced GSC population in GBMs, which may in
turn attenuate angiogenic factors produced by GSCs
to inhibit tumor vascularization. Consistently, As2O3
treatment reduced PML protein and SOX2-positive
cells (GSCs) in xenografts derived from two GSC
lines (T387 and T4121) (Figure 5G, Supplementary
Figure S2E). Although some cancer cells in the As2O3treated xenografts remained to be SOX2 positive
(GSCs), these SOX2 signal almost overlapped with the
PML staining (Figure 5G, Supplementary Figure S2E),
and the majority of SOX+ cells (GSCs) were also
PML-positive (Figure 5H, Supplementary Figure S2F).
Collectively, these data suggested that degradation of
PML triggered by As2O3 resulted in the reduction of
GSC population after As2O3 treatment in vivo, supporting
a critical role of PML in the maintenance of GSCs in
GBM tumors.

PML knockdown in GSCs mimics As2O3
treatment in vitro and in vivo
As As2O3 treatment led to PML reduction and
induced apoptosis in GSCs, we next sought to determine
whether As2O3 exerts its effects on GSCs through
downregulation of PML. To address this issue, we
examined if disruption of PML by shRNA in GSCs shows
similar effects as As2O3 treatment. Two non-overlapping
shRNAs targeting PML, named as shPML-P66 and
shPML-P97, were applied in this study to mediate PML
knockdown. Immunoblot validated the efficiency of
the shRNAs in GSCs (T387 and D456) with more than
80% decrease of endogenous PML protein (Figure 3A,
Supplementary Figure S1A). Tumorsphere formation
assays of the GSCs infected with non-targeting (shNT) or
shPML lentiviruses showed a significant inhibition of GSC
sphere formation after PML knockdown (Figure 3B and
3C, Supplementary Figure S1B). The inhibitory effect of
PML disruption on GSC growth was further quantified by
cell titer assays. Interestingly, PML knockdown not only
suppressed GSC proliferation but also caused severe cell
death, which was demonstrated by the downward cell titer
curves in cells infected with shPML viruses (Figure 3D,

of PML in GSCs, we examined PML distribution in GSCs
and matched NSTCs by immunofluorescent staining.
Grossly, PML signals were exclusively detected in nuclei
in both GSCs and NSTCs. However, while PML nuclear
dots appeared to be smaller and sharper in GSCs, the PML
dots were larger and vaguer in NSTCs (Supplementary

represent a less organized status.
As GSCs and NSTCs displayed different patterns
of PML nuclear bodies, we examined whether GSCs and

Since disruption of PML effectively induced
apoptosis of GSCs, we sought to determine whether the
effect of As2O3 on GSCs is preferential. PML has been
shown to be the organizer for certain specific nuclear
structures, i.e. nuclear bodies, which are punctate small
dots within nuclei. Nuclear bodies are thought to be
transcriptional hot spots and may be involved in many
critical cellular processes [36]. Thus, PML distribution and

NSTCs show differential sensitivity to As2O3 treatment.
While As2O3 treatment significantly inhibited GSC cell
growth, the same dose of As2O3 treatment did not show
a significant effect on matched NSTCs (Figure 6A and
6B, Supplementary Figure S4A and S4B). Consistently,
no induction of the cleaved PARP (the apoptotic marker)
was observed in NSTCs after As2O3 treatment (Figure 6C,
middle panel), but the same As2O3 treatment markedly
induced the cleaved PARP and apoptosis in GSCs (Figure
2A–2C). Interestingly, As2O3 treatment also reduced
PML protein levels in NSTCs (Figure 6C, Supplementary
Figure S4C) but did not show effect on cell growth of
NSTCs. Taken together, the differential response of GSCs
and NSTCs to the As2O3-induced PML reduction and
the different PML distribution in these cell populations
implicated that PML may have distinct functions via
different downstream effectors in GSCs and NSTCs.

protein levels in the majority of tumor cells after As2O3
treatment, indicating c-Myc as a downstream effector
of As2O3 treatment in GBM tumors (Figure 6F and 6G,
Supplementary Figure S4E and S4F). Moreover, transient
overexpression of c-Myc-GFP partially rescued the
growth inhibition caused by As2O3 treatment in GSCs
(Figure 7A). Immunofluorescent analysis indicated that
GSCs overexpressing c-Myc-GFP had less apoptosis
after As2O3 treatment (Figure 7B and 7C), highlighting
the importance of c-Myc in mediating GSC resistance to
As2O3 treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrated
that As2O3 treatment destabilizes PML and c-Myc, which
in turn impairs GSC maintenance, supporting that PML
and its effector c-Myc are critical for the maintenance of
the stem cell-like phenotype and tumorigenic potential of
GSCs. Further investigations are required to unveil the
detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of PML
on c-Myc stability.

c-Myc is the downstream effector of PML in the
GSC maintenance

DISCUSSION

Differential response of GSCs and NSTCs to
As2O3 treatment prompted us to explore the downstream
effector of PML in GSCs. As a time course treatment of
GSCs with As2O3 resulted in gradual decrease of c-Myc
(Figure 2A and 2B), the downregulation of c-Myc after
As2O3-induced PML degradation suggested that c-Myc
may be in the downstream of PML (Figure 2A and 2B).
Previous studies showed that depletion of c-Myc in GSCs
caused severe cell death [40], which is consistent with the
phenotypes caused by As2O3 treatment. Moreover, c-Myc
is preferentially expressed in GSCs relative to NSTCs
[41], whereas As2O3 treatment showed no detectable
effect on NSTCs expressing low level of intrinsic c-Myc
protein (Supplementary Figure S4C). These facts indicate
that c-Myc is a potential effector of PML in GSCs in
response to As2O3 treatment. As PML has been shown to
be a major target of As2O3 in cancer stem cells in leukemia
[31], we sought to determine the regulatory relationship
between PML and c-Myc in GSCs. Knockdown of PML
by shRNA resulted in a marked decrease of c-Myc protein
levels in GSCs (Figure 6D). Furthermore, ubiquitination
assay demonstrated that disruption of PML dramatically
increased poly-ubiquitination of c-Myc protein and
reduced c-Myc levels in GSCs (Figure 6E, Supplementary
Figure S4D), suggesting that PML is required for c-Myc
stabilization in GSCs. As c-Myc has been shown to
interact with PML [38, 42], it’s likely that the interaction
between PML and c-Myc prevents ubiquitinationmediated degradation of c-Myc. Given that c-Myc is an
important downstream effector of PML, the expression
of c-Myc in GSCs in response to As2O3 treatment was
further studied in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of
the GSC-derived intracranial xenografts with or without
As2O3 treatment showed a marked reduction of c-Myc

The high frequency of tumor recurrence in
GBM patients highlights the emergent requirement
for drugs targeting glioma stem cells that are believed
to be responsible for therapeutic resistance and tumor
propagation. Our study suggests As2O3 as a potent drug
preferentially targeting GSCs in GBM tumors. As a FDA
approved drug for leukemia treatment, As2O3 has a long
history in clinical practices with minor and contemporary
side effects [24, 43]. Furthermore, compared with
temozolomide, bevacizumab and other expensive drugs,
As2O3 is an affordable drug with minimal economic
concerns and can benefit the maximum number of GBM
patients. A study in mice has demonstrated that As2O3
is able to enter brain [44]. Although the infusion and
efficiency of As2O3 in human brain tumors remained to
be further determined, it’s likely that As2O3 as a small
molecular drug can pass through the blood brain barrier to
inhibit GBM tumor growth by targeting GSCs in human
brains. As2O3 may have a concentration gradient in vivo
and tumor cells will be killed only with the effective
concentrations. However, As2O3 did inhibit orthotopic
tumor growth in nude mice and thus showed its potential
in treating GBMs. In addition, the increased vascular
permeability in GBMs relative to normal brain tissues
may benefit the As2O3 infusion in the tumor region. Thus,
a suitable As2O3 dosage could exert the maximal inhibitory
effect on tumor with minimal side effects on normal brain
tissues.
We have demonstrated that As2O3 treatment potently
induced apoptosis of GSCs but showed little effect on
matched NSTCs. The differential sensitivity of GSCs and
NSTCs in response to As2O3 treatment may be ascribed to
the destabilization of the GSC transcriptional factor c-Myc

Figure 6: c-Myc is the downstream effector of PML in GSCs that associates with the GSC-preferential effects of
As2O3. A, B. Cell growth curves of T387 GSCs (A) and matched NSTCs (B) in response to As2O3 treatment. 2,000 GSCs or NSTCs were

planted in each well of 96 well plates and then treated with 1 μM As2O3 or vehicle control (0.01N NaOH). Cell titer was determined by the
Glo luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega) at the indicated time points. As2O3 treatment significantly inhibited cell growth of GSCs
but not matched NSTCs. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 (mean ± s.e.m.; two tailed unpaired t-test). C. Immunoblot analysis of NSTCs treated with
As2O3 for varied duration. As2O3 treatment resulted in reduced PML protein but did not induce the cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis.
D. Immunoblot analysis of PML and c-Myc after PML knockdown by shPML (P66 or P97) in GSCs. Disruption of endogenous PML by
shPML resulted in a substantial decrease in c-Myc protein levels in GSCs (T4121). E. Ubiquitination assay of c-Myc in GSCs transduced
with shPML (P66 or P97) or shNT control. GSCs (T4121) were transfected with shPML or shNT through lentiviral infection for 36 hours,
and then treated with 20 μM MG132 for 6 hours. Cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-c-Myc agarose beads,
and the c-Myc poly-ubiquitination status was determined with anti-ubiquitin antibody. A significant increase in c-Myc polyubiquitination
and a decrease of c-Myc protein levels were detected in cells transduced with shPML relative to the shNT control. Tubulin was used as
the internal control for the input of immunoprecipitation (lower panel). F. Immunohistochemistry of c-Myc to determine the population of
cells with high c-Myc expression in T387 GSC-derived xenografts after As2O3 treatment. Sections of GSC-derived xenografts were stained
with the antibody against c-Myc. Xenografts treated with As2O3 showed much weaker c-Myc staining (in brown) than those treated with
the vehicle control. G. Bar graphs showing the population of cells with high c-Myc expression in the xenografts treated with As2O3 or
vehicle control. A significant reduction of cells with high c-Myc expression was detected in As2O3-treated xenografts relative to the control
xenografts. ***p < 0.001 (mean ± s.e.m.; two tailed unpaired t-test).

with c-Myc-GFP or control lentiviruses. 48 hours after infection, GSC spheres were fixed with 4% PFA. Frozen sections of the spheres were
stained with the antibody against the apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 (red). Exogenous c-Myc expression was monitored by GFP signal
(green). As2O3 treatment resulted in a significant increase in cleaved Caspase-3 signal in control infected GSC spheres. However, c-Myc-GFP
overexpressing GSC spheres showed significant fewer cleaved Caspase-3 staining relative to the control spheres. C. Bar graph to show the

a pivotal regulator controlling multiple cellular activities
[45]. c-Myc is highly expressed in GSCs relative to
NSTCs or normal neural progenitor cells, which provides
the molecular basis for the discrimination between GSCs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and NSTCs [40, 41]. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the stabilization of c-Myc by PML in GSCs
remain unclear. Previous reports described the partially
localization of c-Myc in nuclear bodies along with the
37310

Oncotarget

physical interaction between c-Myc and PML [38, 42]. It
is possible that the nuclear bodies may sequester c-Myc
and prevent c-Myc from the ubiquitination-mediated
degradation, thereby maintain high c-Myc protein level in
GSCs. On the other hand, PML nuclear bodies are believed
to be transcriptional hot spots. It has been shown that PML
affects transcription of several c-Myc target genes [42].
From this aspect, degradation of PML by As2O3 may affect
the c-Myc regulated transcriptome in GSCs which in turn
impairs the maintenance of GSCs. Although c-Myc is
barely detected in neural progenitor cells, PML is found
to regulate the fate of neural progenitor cells in mouse
developing neocortex through affecting the subcellular
distribution of the retinoblastoma protein and the protein
phosphatase 1α [46]. The role of PML in human neural
progenitor cells remains unknown. In vitro treatment of
human neural progenitor cell lines with As2O3 reduced
PML protein levels without obvious effects on cell growth
(Supplementary Figure S5). Thus, PML in normal and
tumor stem cells has distinct functions, which are likely
to be mediated by different PML downstream pathways.
In previous reports using in vitro cultured GBM
tumour-spheres, the inhibition of Notch downstream
factors was observed after As2O3 treatment [32]. However,
there’s no evidence showing that Notch pathway could
directly mediate the effects of As2O3 stimulation. On
the contrary, PML is widely recognized as the major
and immediate target of As2O3 [26, 28]. In fact, PML is
involved in regulation of several key factors in stem cells.
PML/mTOR axis plays a critical role in the maintenance
of hematopoietic stem cells [31]. Interestingly, PML is
also reported to contribute to GBM resistance to mTOR
targeted therapies [47], suggesting its involvement in
GBM tumor progression. In addition, PML expression
is required for survival of hematopoietic stem cells and
breast cancer stem cells through activation of PPAR-δ
pathway [48, 49]. Moreover, multiple key transcriptional
factors important for stem cell maintenance, including
Oct4, Nanog, Stat3 and REST, have been shown to be
associated with PML in stem cells [50–52]. Even the
Notch pathway may be regulated by PML [53]. Thus,
PML may support GSCs through multiple pathways,
and degradation of PML induced by As2O3 treatment has
complex destructive effects on GSC maintenance.
PML has seven known major isoforms, each
containing some transcriptional variants and the
corresponding protein products [36, 54]. Our results
suggested expression of multiple PML isoforms in
GSCs (Figure 2A and 2B). However, introduction of
shRNA resistant PMLI and PMLIV, either respectively
or in combination, could not rescue the GSCs depleted
of endogenous PML proteins (data not shown). Since
multiple, if not all, PML isoforms participate in nuclear
body formation [37, 39], plural PML isoforms may
function as a complex in GSCs and each of these isoforms
is indispensable for GSC survival. In the meantime, PML
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has several kinds of post-translational modifications
including sumoylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
and acetylation [27–29, 55]. It would be interesting to
determine whether these modifications are relevant to
targeting of GSCs by As2O3.
In summary, we found that As2O3 treatment can
efficiently target GSCs in vitro and in vivo. Such effects
can be mainly ascribed to the As2O3-induced PML
reduction and subsequent c-Myc degradation mediated
by poly-ubiquitination. Our findings suggest a clinical
application of the well-known anti-leukemia drug As2O3
in treating the malignant brain tumors by targeting glioma
stem cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and culture of glioma stem cells (GSCs)
GSCs were isolated from primary GBM tumors
or subcutaneous xenografts as previously described
[3, 14, 41, 56, 57]. De-identified GBM surgical specimens
were collected from Cleveland Clinic Brain Tumor
and Neuro-Oncology Center in accordance with an
Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. GBM
tumor cells were dissociated with the Papain Dissociation
System (Worthington Biochemical) and GSCs were sorted
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using
two GSC surface markers (CD15/CD133). GSCs were
validated for their capacity of serial sphere formation,
in vitro induction of differentiation and in vivo tumor
propagation as previously described [3, 14, 57]. NSTCs
were sorted CD133−/CD15− cells from the same tumor.

Establishment of GSC-derived orthotopic GBM
xenografts and As2O3 treatment
Orthotopic GBM xenografts were derived from
intracranial transplantation of GSCs as described [3, 14,
57]. Athymic female immunocompromised C57/BL6 mice
of 4–6 weeks (Charles River Laboratories) were used for
animal experiments. GSCs transduced with luciferase
and/or shPML (P66 or P97) or shNT were injected into
the right cerebral cortex at a depth of 3.5 mm. Mice were
monitored by bioluminescent imaging or maintained
until manifestation of neurological signs. Mouse Kaplan–
Meier survival curves were made with GraphPad Prism
5 software by using Logrank two-tail analysis. All
animal protocols were approved by the Animal Research
Committee of the Cleveland Clinic, and all animals
were housed in the Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited
animal facility of the Cleveland Clinic.
Treatment of mice with As2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
202673–5G) was started on the fourth day after intracranial
implantation of GSCs expressing luciferase. Mice were
treated with As2O3 at a dosage of 5 μg/g (in 0.01 M NaOH)
37311

Oncotarget

of body weight daily through intraperitoneal injection
throughout the period of tumor growth. The control group
mice were treated with the same volume of vehicle control
(0.01 M NaOH) per day. The similar dosage of As2O3
(5 μg/g/IP/daily) applied in this treatment has been used
for treating leukemia in mice by other published studies
[33, 34]. No sign of toxicity was observed in As2O3 treated
mice other than a slight weight loss.

from Sigma (TRCN0000003866 for shPML-P66,
TRCN0000355997 for shPML-P97, SHC002 for shNT).
For virus package, 293FT cells were transfected with
lentiviral construct along with psPAX2 and VSVG.
48–72 hours after transfection, viral supernatants were
collected and transduced into cells. Infected cells were
selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin for 2 days to get rid of
uninfected cells.

Immunoblot analysis

Ubiquitination assay

Immunoblotting was performed as previously
described [9, 56–58]. Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM
EDTA pH8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaF, 20 mM
beta-Glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na2VO3, 1 mM PMSF,
protease inhibitor cocktail) and subjected to SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Biorad),
blocked by 5% milk for 30 minutes, and incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were
washed with TBST for 3 times and incubated with
secondary antibody for 2 hours at room temperature.
Membranes were then washed with TBST for 3 times
and subjected to chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo
Scientific). Signals were detected with ChemiDoc
XRS + Imager (Biorad).

Ubiquitination assay was performed as previously
described [58]. GSCs overexpressing shNT or shPML
shRNAs were treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (20 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, C2211–5MG) for
6 hours and then lysed in TritonX-100 lysis buffer,
immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc agarose affinity
gel (Sigma-Aldrich, A7470–1ML) and immunoblotted
with an anti-ubiquitin (Biolegend, 646301) or
anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-40). Briefly, cell
lysates (300 μg of total protein) were incubated with
15 μL anti-Myc conjugated agarose gel with constant
rotation overnight at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were
washed three times with ice-cold 0.3% Triton X-100 in
PBS buffer and eluted in loading buffer by boiling for
10 min, and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteins
were resolved on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gels
(Invitrogen, NP0322BOX), blotted onto polyvinylidene
membranes and probed by antibodies specific to
ubiquitin and c-Myc.

Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
Immunofluorescent
staining
and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed as
described [9, 56–58]. For cultured GSCs, cells were
attached to the hES-Matrix coated coverslips before
staining. For immunofluorescence, Alexa-conjugated
secondary (Life Technologies) antibodies were applied.
For immunohistochemistry, ­biotinylated secondary
antibodies were used together with the Vectastain ABC kit
and the DAB kit (Vector Laboratories) per manufacturer’s
instructions.

Statistical analysis
The level of significance was determined by a twotailed un-paired Student’s t-test (bar graphs) or analysis
of variance with α = 0.05 (survival curves), and then
analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 software. All quantitative
data presented are the mean ± s.e.m. from at least three
samples or experiments per data point.
