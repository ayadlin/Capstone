Abstract
A global understanding of miRNA function in EGFR signaling
pathways may provide insights into improving the management of
KRAS-mutant lung cancers, which remain relatively recalcitrant to
treatment. To identify miRNAs implicated in EGFR signaling, we
transduced bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with retroviral
vectors expressing KRASG12V and monitored miRNA expression
patterns by microarray analysis. Through this approach, we deﬁned
miR-29b as an important target for upregulation by mutant KRAS
in non–small cell lung cancers. Cell biologic analyses showed
that pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR or MEK was sufﬁcient
to reduce levels of miR-29b, while PI3K inhibition had no effect.
In KRASG12V-transduced BEAS-2B cells, introduction of anti-miR29b constructs increased the sensitivity to apoptosis, arguing that

miR-29b mediated apoptotic resistance conferred by mutant KRAS.
Mechanistic investigations traced this effect to the ability of miR29b to target TNFAIP3/A20, a negative regulator of NF-kB signaling.
Accordingly, overexpression of an miR-29b–refractory isoform of
TNFAIP3 restored NF-kB and extrinsic apoptosis, conﬁrming that
TNFAIP3 is a functionally relevant target of miR-29b. We also noted
that miR-29b could confer sensitivity to intrinsic apoptosis triggered by exposure to cisplatin, a drug used widely in lung
cancer treatment. Thus, miR-29b expression may tilt cells from
extrinsic to intrinsic mechanisms of apoptosis. Overall, our results
reveal a complexity in cancer for miR-29b, which can act as either
an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene depending on signaling
context. Cancer Res; 76(14); 4160–9. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

of patients with metastatic NSCLC respond to platinum-based
chemotherapy (3).
Activating mutations in the oncogenes KRAS (25%–40%) and
EGFR (10%–15%) and translocations of ALK (5%–7%) are
frequently found in Caucasian lung adenocarcinoma patients,
rendering constitutive active downstream signaling of the EGFR
pathway (4). These driver mutations are directly implicated in
malignant processes, such as proliferation, migration, or antiapoptosis, and promote lung cancer development (5). Tyrosine
kinase inhibitors are nowadays standard of care for a subgroup of
metastatic NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations (6, 7)
or ALK translocations (8). They often lead to remarkable clinical
responses compared with standard cytotoxic therapy, but virtually
all patients eventually relapse owing to reactivation of downstream signaling pathways (9, 10).
NSCLC cells rely on the overexpression of BCL2 and its
antiapoptotic family members as part of the survival strategy
during tumor progression and chemoresistance (11). In healthy
cells, stress-induced intrinsic apoptosis leads to an orchestrated
block of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members through BH3only proteins, followed by mitochondrial cytochrome c-release
and cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, resulting in cell death. On the
other hand, upon extracellular death triggers, caspases 8 and 3
are cleaved and lead to extrinsic apoptosis. These critical events
are counteracted through upregulation of BCL2 (12). Crossactivation of additional malignant pathways, such as NF-kB
favor BCL2-mediated antiapoptosis. Physiologically, NF-kB is
kept in check by the inhibitor of NF-kB a (IkBa), but upon
stimulation by external signals or stress, IkB kinase (IKK) is
activated and phosphorylates and targets IkBa for proteasome
degradation. As a result, NF-kB translocates into the nucleus,

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide with a mean 5-year survival rate of less than 15%
(1). Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the majority of all lung cancers and is predominantly comprised of
adenocarcinoma, which accounts for 40% of NSCLC. Other
forms of NSCLCs are squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), large cell
carcinoma, and further rare subtypes. Adenocarcinomas have
their origin in the distant airways, whereas SCCs most often
arise in the major bronchi (2). Treatment includes resection of
the tumor and accompanying platinum-based chemotherapy.
However, the majority of patients presenting with NSCLC
cannot be cured due to advanced disease, and less than 30%

miR-29b Mediates KRAS Signaling in NSCLC

where it transactivates genes involved in proliferation and
antiapoptosis (reviewed in ref. 13).
miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules, which regulate
biologic processes by binding target mRNAs, leading to their
inactivation by translational inhibition or degradation. miRNAs
participate in signaling networks as backups of transcriptional
control (reviewed in ref. 14): They act either as signal ampliﬁers or
attenuators and promote cross-talk between signaling pathways.
Alterations in miRNA expression critically contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance mechanisms (reviewed in refs. 15, 16).
Reconstituting the expression of miRNAs in the tumor of patients
by administering antagomiRs or by miRNA delivery may open
novel avenues for personalized medicine. Similar approaches
could be used to interfere with resistance mechanisms.
In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs that act as mediators
of EGFR signaling. To this end, we ectopically expressed constitutively active KRASG12V or PIK3CAH1047R in bronchial epithelial
cells and provide results showing that miR-29b is strongly upregulated in cells harboring mutated KRASG12V. We report for the
ﬁrst time that miR-29b is responsible for KRAS-induced protection of lung cancer cells from extrinsic apoptosis by mediating the
activation of the NF-kB pathway. Interestingly, miR-29b confers
sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that miR29b tips the balance from extrinsic apoptosis toward intrinsic
apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299 were obtained
from the ATCC in 2008 and were cultured in Iscove's Modiﬁed
Dulbecco's Medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells (kindly provided by Prof. M. Geiser, Institute of
Anatomy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland, in 2012) were
cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). Human PC9ER and PC9 (in
2013) and H460 (in 2015) were kindly provided by Dr. A. Arcaro
(Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland). HCC4011 and HCC827 (kindly provided by Prof. A. F.
Gazdar and Prof. J. Minna, University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, Dallas, TX, in 2009) were cultured in RPMI
medium. All cell lines were authenticated by cell line typing
analysis (STR proﬁling) in 2016. Media were supplemented with
2 mmol/L L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Bioswisstec AG) 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and 5% to 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 C and
5% CO2. 293T cells (ATCC in 2009) were cultured in DMEM,
supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 5% FBS
(Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37 C and 7.5% CO2. Geﬁtinib
(LC Laboratories), U0126 (Enzo Life Sciences), and LY294002
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used at concentrations indicated in the text.

negative control #1 (Ambion), esiRNA human tnfaip3 (SigmaAldrich), or siGENOME nontargeting siRNA pool 2 (Dharmacon)
by using the transfection reagent HiPerFect (Qiagen) as published
previously (18). Ten nanograms of luciferase reporter constructs
and 40 ng pGl4.74-normalizing plasmid or 25 ng pGI4.32 luciferase reporter plasmid and 1.5 ng pGl4.73-normalizing plasmid
(Promega AG) were used in combination with the transfection

(10 ng/mL) plus 0.5 mg/mL actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich),
50 ng/mL TRAIL (Genentech), or 4 mg/mL cisplatin (Spitalpharmazie Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland) were used to induce cell
death. Caspase-3/7, 8, or 9 activity was determined as described
previously (17). Annexin V/propidium Iodide (PI)–positive cells
were analyzed using a LSR II Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson)

(Toray Industries Inc.; Exiqon A/S). The x-fold expression was
determined by normalizing KRASG12V- to control-transduced
cells.

described previously (17), except that 20 mg of protein was loaded
per lane. Protein expression was determined by using antibodies
detecting AKT (clone 40D4, 1:1,000), phospho-AKT (D7F10,
1:1,000), ERK1/2 (L34F12, 1:2,000), phospho-ERK1/2
(D13.14.4E, 1:2,000), phospho-S6 (polyclonal, 1:1,000),
TNFAIP3 (polyclonal, 1:1,000), phospho-IkBa (5A5, 1:2,000),

Results
KRAS mutation induces upregulated miR-29b expression
The ERK and PI3K pathways constitute the major branches of
the EGFR pathway in NSCLC. To identify effector miRNAs of
the EGFR pathway, bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were
retrovirally transduced with constitutive active KRASG12V or
PIK3CAH1047R mutants, and individual clones were analyzed for
the activity of signaling pathways by Western blot analysis. BEAS2B cells were selected as they give rise to low intrinsic activity of the
EGFR pathway (23). Expression of KRASG12V in BEAS-2B cells
resulted in up to 27-times higher ERK1/2 phosphorylation and up
to 38-times higher expression of its downstream effector CCND1
relative to the control (Fig. 1A). PIK3CAH1047R-transduced clones
revealed up to 5-fold elevated pAKT levels, but the level of the
downstream effector pS6 was not elevated (Supplementary Fig.
S1). miRNA expression proﬁling was carried out by microarrays
using the Exiqon S/A and Toray Inc. platforms. Both platforms
revealed enhanced levels of all miR-29 paralogs, miR-138 and
miR-222 in KRASG12V cells (Table 1), while no signiﬁcant change
in the miRNA expression proﬁle was detected in PIK3CAH1047R
cells (data not shown). miR-222 is a known effector of EGFR
signaling in lung cancer (24), whereas miR-29 and miR-138 have
not been studied yet in EGFR signaling. We validated upregulation of miR-29b and miR-138 expression by qPCR in clonal BEAS2B cells transduced with KRASG12V (Fig. 1B; Table 1). In line with
these results, miR-29b expression was upregulated in primary
adenocarcinoma tissue samples harboring KRAS or EGFR mutations relative to adenocarcinomas containing wild-type KRAS and
EGFR (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, we conﬁrmed
that miR-29b expression is downregulated in primary NSCLC

with wild-type EGFR and KRAS compared with matched normal
tissue (Fig. 1C; ref. 25), which was mainly due to changes in
copy number of the miR-29b2 locus (Supplementary Fig. S2).
However, we were unable to conﬁrm induced miR-138 expression
in mutant KRAS tumor samples, as KRAS- and EGFR-mutant
and wild-type tumors gave rise to similar levels of miR-138
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We focused on miR-29b for further
studies, as this paralog was most strongly induced by KRAS
signaling (Table 1).
miR-29b expression is regulated via the KRAS–ERK signaling
pathway
KRAS induces both ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. To elucidate the underlying regulation of miR-29b expression, we
employed inhibitors of the EGFR signaling pathway and measured
miR-29b expression by qPCR. First, EGFR inhibition by geﬁtinib
led to downregulated miR-29b expression in PC9 or HCC827 cells
harboring an activating EGFR mutation. In contrast, miR-29b

expression was only slightly reduced in geﬁtinib-resistant PC9ER
cells (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this ﬁnding, CCND1 mRNA levels
were reduced in PC9 and HCC827 cells, but not in PC9ER cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). The MEK inhibitor U0126 led to signiﬁcantly reduced levels of miR-29b (Fig. 2B) as well as pERK1/2
(Supplementary Fig. S4B) in the NSCLC cell lines PC9 and
HCC4011 harboring an EGFR mutation. Similar results were also
obtained in the A549 cell line harboring a KRAS mutation. In
contrast, inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 did not alter the expression of miR-29b (Fig. 2C), but pS6 protein was strongly reduced
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). miR-29b expression was also signiﬁcantly decreased upon MEK inhibition in KRAS-transduced as well
as in control-transduced BEAS-2B cells, whereas PI3K inhibition
had no effect (Fig. 2D). Thus, induction of miR-29b expression by
EGFR signaling is mediated via the KRAS/MEK/ERK pathway.
NSCLC cells overexpressing miR-29b are protected from
extrinsic apoptosis
KRAS is an important mediator of oncogenic processes. In lung
cancer, constitutively active KRAS-mutant forms confer apoptosis
resistance by inducing NF-kB signaling (26, 27). In line with this
ﬁnding, we show that ectopic expression of KRASG12V conferred
resistance of BEAS-2B cells to extrinsic apoptosis (Fig. 3A) induced
by TNFa and actinomycin D (TNFa þ ActD; ref. 28). To assess
whether miR-29b is a mediator of KRAS signaling, we overexpressed precursor miR-29b in NSCLC cells and measured caspase3/7 cleavage upon triggering apoptosis by TNFa þ ActD. Indeed,
A549 or BEAS-2B cells overexpressing miR-29b were protected
from TNFa þ ActD–induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B), thereby

phenocopying the expression of KRASG12V (Fig. 3A). Consistent
results were also obtained in TRAIL-sensitive H460 cells, in which
extrinsic apoptosis was induced by TRAIL (Fig. 3C). Decreased
apoptosis was conﬁrmed by measuring Annexin V-positive cells
by FACS (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S5). In contrast, when
endogenous miR-29b levels were blocked by transducing A549
cells with an anti-miR-29b–overexpressing construct, cells were
increasingly sensitive to TNFa þ ActD–induced apoptosis (Fig.
3E). TNFa and TRAIL belong to the TNF family, which bind to
their respective death receptors and induce the extrinsic apoptosis
pathway by caspase-8 cleavage (29). Consistently, caspase-8
activity was reduced upon TNFa þ ActD stimulus in A549 cells
overexpressing miR-29b (Fig. 3F). In addition, caspase-8 activity
was decreased in H460 cells treated with TRAIL (Fig. 3G). Most
importantly, apoptosis was increased in KRASG12V cells, cotransduced by the anti-miR-29b construct, whereas no changes were
apparent in control-transduced cells (Fig. 3H), indicating that
miR-29b mediates the protection from extrinsic apoptosis in
NSCLC cells elicited by KRASG12V.
miR-29b exerts the KRAS signal by activating the NF-kB pathway
To assess whether miR-29b confers resistance to extrinsic apoptosis by inducing the activity of NF-kB, we transfected cells with
precursor miR-29b as well as a NF-kB reporter construct and
measured luminescence activity. NF-kB was activated in BEAS-2B
as well as in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299 upon overexpression of miR-29b (Fig. 4A). In line with these results,
KRASG12V-transduced BEAS-2B cells induced NF-kB activity, again
phenocopying miR-29b overexpression (Fig. 4B). On the contrary, NF-kB activation was reduced to basal levels in KRASG12V/
anti-miR-29b cotransduced BEAS-2B cells, which highlights that
miR-29b is an important mediator of NF-kB signaling elicited by
KRASG12V (Fig. 4B). To conﬁrm NF-kB activation using an independent approach, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of A549
cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In the absence of
TNFa, nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic pIkBa levels were increased,
but cytoplasmic p65 was lower in cells overexpressing miR-29b
compared with the control (Fig. 4C), consistent with the activation of NF-kB. Similar results were also obtained in BEAS-2B cells
transduced with KRASG12V compared with pBABE control (Fig.
4D), while NF-kB activation was reversed in cells coexpressing
KRASG12V and anti-miR-29b (Fig. 4E). Likewise, the kinetics of
TNFa-induced IkBa phosphorylation was accelerated or delayed
in BEAS-2B cells overexpressing KRASG12V or anti-miR-29b,
respectively. In contrast, the kinetics of TNFa-induced IkBa
phosphorylation was unaffected in A549 cells overexpressing
miR-29b. Overexpression of miR-29b resulted in enhanced
expression, whereas anti-miR-29b resulted in reduced expression
of NF-kB–responsive genes (Fig. 4F; ref. 30). Thus, KRASG12V
induces NF-kB activation by enhancing miR-29b expression.

TNFAIP3 encompassing the predicted miR-29b–binding site was
cloned downstream of the luciferase gene and transiently transfected into A549, H1299, H460, or BEAS-2B cells. The wild-type
miR-29b target site conferred reduced luciferase activity relative to
the progenitor construct containing no target site upon pre-miR29b transfection (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6B). On the
contrary, downregulation of luciferase activity was abrogated in a
construct in which the miR-29b–binding site was mutated (Fig.
5A and Supplementary Fig. S6C). TNFAIP3 protein expression
was downregulated upon miR-29b overexpression in A549 or

direct target of miR-29b.
To assess whether enhanced NF-kB activity and apoptosis

S6E). miR-29b elicited a 1.4- to 1.5-fold induction of NF-kB
activity in control transduced A549 or BEAS-2B cells, whereas
NF-kB induction was completely abrogated in cells ectopically
expressing TNFAIP3 (Fig. 5E). In line with these results, miR-29b
was signiﬁcantly less efﬁcient in conferring apoptosis resistance in
A549 or BEAS-2B cells ectopically expressing TNFAIP3 compared
with control-transduced cells. Thus, ectopic TNFAIP3 can restore
miR-29b–induced activation of NF-kB and apoptosis resistance.
In agreement with these results, a siRNA pool targeting TNFAIP3
phenocopied enhanced NF-kB activity and reduced caspase-3/7
activity elicited by miR-29b (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S6F
and S6G).
miR-29b discriminates between mode of apoptosis
Interestingly, miR-29b is a known tumor-suppressing miRNA
that induces apoptosis in different cell systems (32). This is in
contrast to our ﬁndings that miR-29b protects NSCLC cells from
extrinsic apoptosis. To address these apparently contradictory
ﬁndings, A549 or H1299 cells were treated with cisplatin, which
induces mitochondrial apoptosis by activating stress-sensing
proapoptotic BCL2 family members. To our surprise, miR-29b
overexpression conferred apoptosis sensitivity rather than resistance under these conditions, as indicated by an up to 3-times
higher caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 6A) and a 4.4-times higher
proportion of Annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7A). In contrast, caspase-3/7 activity was reduced in
A549 and H1299 cells transduced with anti-miR-29b (Fig. 6A).
Furthermore, cisplatin-induced caspase-8 as well as caspase-9
activities were increased (Fig. 6C and D) while MCL1 mRNA was
decreased (Supplementary Fig. S7B) upon miR-29b overexpression, supporting the notion that miR-29b sensitizes cells to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis via both apoptotic pathways. In
comparison, diminished caspase-9 activity after TNFa þ ActD
administration was detected in Fig. 6D, indicating that miR-29b
facilitates TNFa þ ActD–induced apoptosis via caspase-9, which
is typically found in type II–speciﬁc cell death (33).

Discussion
A growing number of miRNAs may exhibit a dual function as a
tumor-suppressing miRNA and an oncogenic miRNA depending
on the tissue and cellular context. miR-29b sensitizes cancer cells
to apoptosis by targeting antiapoptotic genes, including MCL1,
BCL2, AKT2, CCND2, and CDC42 (reviewed in ref. 32). It also
negatively regulates proliferation and migration by targeting
genes involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix and
restores erroneous promoter methylation by targeting DNMT3A
and 3B. On the other hand, miR-29b or its paralogs promote
tumor progression, apoptosis resistance, and metastasis of hematologic malignancies and solid cancers by targeting key tumor
suppressors, including PTEN, TET2, or proapoptotic genes
(34–36). The molecular mechanisms that determine whether a
miRNA is tumorigenic or antitumorigenic are largely unknown.
We show that miR-29b can act in a proapoptotic or antiapoptotic
manner depending on the external stimulus (Fig. 6E). Consistent
with results in other cell systems (37), we show that miR-29b
sensitizes NSCLC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin is
considered primarily an inducer of intrinsic apoptosis, although
extrinsic apoptosis is also induced to some extent (38). In agreement with this ﬁnding, both caspase-9 and caspase-8 activities
were signiﬁcantly enhanced by miR-29b. In contrast, extrinsic

apoptosis induced by TNFa þ ActD or TRAIL was signiﬁcantly
reduced in NSCLC cells overexpressing miR-29b. Thus, miR-29b
tips the balance from extrinsic to intrinsic apoptosis. This is a
novel ﬁnding, which may have profound consequences for the
biology of tumor cells (see below).
miR-29b confers apoptosis resistance by targeting TNFAIP3/
A20. This is based on the ﬁnding that miR-29b affects the expression of TNFAIP3 protein and represses the activity of a luciferase
reporter construct containing the miR-29b target site. In agreement with this result, NF-kB activity was signiﬁcantly induced in
cells overexpressing miR-29b as indicated by NF-kB reporter
assays, IkB phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of NF-kB
as well as induced expression of NF-kB–responsive genes. Intracellular miR-29b levels were sufﬁcient to affect NF-kB activity as

indicated by KRASG12V/anti-miR-29b cotransduction experiments. Most importantly, however, enhanced NF-kB activity and
reduced apoptosis elicited by miR-29b was abrogated in NSCLC
cell lines overexpressing miR-29b–refractory TNFAIP3. Thus,
TNFAIP3 is a relevant target of miR-29b implicated in these
processes. NF-kB activity induced by miR-29b leads to upregulation of antiapoptotic genes, rendering cancer cells insensitive to
the extrinsic apoptotic program (39). Expression of BCL2 family
members is also induced by NF-kB conferring insensitivity to
cisplatin (40). However, it is well established that miR-29b
directly targets the antiapoptotic gene MCL1 in lung cancer
(41), tipping the balance toward intrinsic apoptosis (Fig. 6E).
miR-29b was previously shown to act as a decoy to protect
TNFAIP3/A20 from degradation by HuR in sarcomas, which is
based on the ﬁnding that miR-29b directly interacted with HuR
mRNA, but not with TNFAIP3 mRNA (42). The reason for the
discrepancy of these results is unknown, but it may be explained
by differences of HuR mRNA expression in these tumor systems.
We show for the ﬁrst time that miR-29b is an important
mediator of KRAS signaling in antiapoptotic processes of NSCLC.
Overexpression of oncogenic KRAS results in NF-kB activation
(26, 43–46), whereas inhibition of NF-kB signaling induced
apoptosis (26, 46), underlining the importance of this survival
pathway in KRAS-induced transformation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of KRAS-induced NF-kB activation is
not well understood. It was suggested that KRAS induces NF-kB
activation by phosphorylation of IKK (43), but this was contradicted by others (44, 45). We conﬁrmed enhanced NF-kB activity
in lung epithelial cells overexpressing KRASG12V. In addition, we
provide a novel mechanism by which miR-29b links the KRAS
signaling with the NF-kB pathway. We show that miR-29b expression is signiﬁcantly induced in epithelial cells overexpressing
KRASG12V as well as in NSCLC tissues harboring KRAS or EGFR
mutations. In agreement with these results, inhibitors of EGFR
and MEK, but not PI3K, reduced the expression of miR-29b. To
link KRAS and NF-kB signaling, we downregulated miR-29b
expression in KRASG12V-transduced cells and demonstrated that
NF-kB activity was completely restored. In agreement with this
result, cells were more susceptible to extrinsic apoptosis, conﬁrming that apoptosis resistance was due to enhanced NF-kB activity.
KRAS-transduced tumors rely on NF-kB activity for survival
(26, 46). No signiﬁcant correlation of the postoperative overall
survival and miR-29b expression was noted for patients with
KRAS or EGFR mutations (data not shown). This may be due to
the heterogeneous collective in terms of clinical–pathologic parameters or, alternatively, may suggest an additional mechanism to
miR-29b overexpression conferring apoptosis resistance of KRAStransduced tumors.

EGFR mutations (5, 6) and ALK or ROS translocations (8),
which occur in about 20% of NSCLC, were successfully exploited
for the development of targeted therapy. In contrast, patients with
KRAS mutations, which occur in 20% to 30% of NSCLC, are not
amenable to novel forms of therapy. KRAS initiates an apoptotic
response, which is suppressed by the activation of NF-kB in cell
lines (46) as well as in a mouse model of lung cancer (26). Thus,
NF-kB inhibition could be exploited for the treatment of KRASdriven lung adenocarcinoma. This could potentially be achieved
by administering a miR-29b antagomiR, as this may uncouple
KRAS and NF-kB signaling. On the other hand, miR-29b overexpression may sensitize NSCLC to platinum-based therapy. It
should be kept in mind, however, that a miR-29b–based therapy
may turn out to be a double-edged sword, as it may interfere with
both apoptotic pathways in opposite directions.
