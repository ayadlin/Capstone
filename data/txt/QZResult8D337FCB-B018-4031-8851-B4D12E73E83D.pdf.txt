ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells induce, in vitro, NK cell abnormalities
(NKCAs) including apoptosis and activating receptor down-regulation. The potential
negative impact of AML cells on the therapeutic efficacy of NK cell-based strategies
prompted us to analyze the mechanisms underlying NKCAs and to develop approaches
to protect NK cells from NKCAs. NKCA induction by the AML leukemia cells target
a subpopulation of peripheral blood NK cells and is interleukin-2 independent
but is abrogated by a long-term culture of NK (LTNK) cells at 37°C. LTNK cells
displayed a significantly enhanced ability to damage AML cells in vitro and inhibited
the subcutaneous growth of ML-2 cells grafted into CB17 SCID mice. Actinomycin
D restored the susceptibility of LTNK cells to NKCAs while TAPI-0, a functional analog
of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 3, inhibits ML-2 cell-induced
NKCAs suggesting that the generation of NK cell resistance to NKCAs involves RNA
transcription and metalloproteinase (MPP) inactivation. This conclusion is supported
by the reduced susceptibility to AML cell-induced NKCAs of LTNK cells in which TIMP3
gene and protein are over-expressed. This information may contribute to the rational
design of targeted strategies to enhance the efficacy of NK cell-based-immunotherapy
of AML with haploidentical NK cells.

experimental and clinical evidence indicates that AML
cells damage NK cells; this damage reduces the ability of
NK cells to control AML cell growth and provides AML
cells with the capacity to escape from NK cell immunity.
The damages induced by AML cells to NK cells both in
vitro and in vivo are referred to as NKCAs; they include
apoptosis[8], defective expression and function of natural
cytotoxic receptors (NCRs), [9, 10] and CD16 downregulation. Scant information is available about the
mechanism(s) underlying the induction of NKCAs by
AML cells; although, this information may contribute to
the rationale design of strategies to inhibit or counteract

INTRODUCTION
Growing clinical evidence indicates that
immunotherapy with NK cells is useful in the treatment of
myeloid leukemia. However, in the majority of patients,
the efficacy of this therapy is limited since the clinical
responses are not always complete, or the disease recurs.
[1–7] These clinical findings have prompted investigators
to characterize the interactions of NK cells with AML
cells, since the resulting information may contribute to
the rationale design of strategies to optimize the efficacy
of NK cell-based immunotherapy of AML. Convincing

their induction. Therefore, in this study guided by the
notion that MMP chemical inhibitors reverse CD16
down-regulation,[11] induced by AML cells, we have
investigated whether MMP endogenous inhibitors are
involved in the inhibition of AML cell-induced CD16
down-regulation. Furthermore, because of the association
of CD16 cross-linking by mAb with the induction of NK
cell apoptosis,[12] we have investigated the role of CD16
in the induction of AML-cell induced NK cell apoptosis
and depletion. Lastly, taking advantage of the information
generated by these experiments, we have developed
a strategy to counteract the induction of NKCAs by
leukemia cells.

NKCA induction by AML cells
Incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) with the human AML cell line, ML-2, for 5
hours at 37°C induced: 1) CD16 down-regulation on NK
cells; 2) apoptosis of NK cells as indicated by an increased
frequency of Annexin-V+ NK cells as compared to the
PBMCs incubated without the leukemic cell line and 3)
depletion of NK cells as shown by a reduction in their
number as compared to that in PBMCs incubated without
the leukemia cell line. Similar results were obtained when

Figure 1: Human AML cell-induced NKCAs involves CD16 antigen. Panel A. PBMCs from healthy donors were cultured

for 3 days in the presence of IL-2. Cells were then harvested and incubated with AML cells at a ratio of 4 PBMCs to 1 AML cell.
PBMCs incubated under the same experimental conditions, but without AML cells were used as controls. Following a 5-hour incubation
at 37°C, cells were stained with FITC-annexin-V, PE-anti-CD16, PE-Cy5-anti-CD3, APC-anti-CD56 and analyzed utilizing a 2-laser flow
cytometer. We assessed the effects of AML cells on CD16 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), NK cell apoptosis, and NK cell depletion by
designing an electronic gate on CD16+CD56+CD3- cells. This figure shows data obtained from 6 experiments independently performed.
Panel B. Following a 3-day activation with IL-2, PBMCs were harvested, and NK cells were negatively sorted using immunomagnetic
beads. NK cells were then incubated in the absence (panel B, upper left) or presence (panel B, lower left) of ML-2 cells. NK cells were
incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of the indicated anti-CD157 mAb with or without ML-2 cells then washed.
Quadrant numbers indicate CD16 MFI. Following a 5-hour incubation CD16 and CD56 antigens and annexin-V were evaluated by flow
cytometry. Panel C. shows differential expression of annexin-V on NK cells stimulated as indicated. This figure shows a representative

the AML cell lines THP-1 and U937 were used; although,
with some differences in the extent of changes. THP-1 cells
were significantly less potent inducers of NKCAs than ML-2
and U937 cell lines (Figure 1A). The latter two cell lines
did not differ from each other. The extent of the NKCAs
induced by leukemia cells was markedly increased when
NK cells incubated with leukemia cells were activated by
cross-linking of CD16 mediated by its interaction with the
Fc fragment of the CD157-specific mAb SY11B5. CD157
is expressed on leukemia cells but is not detectable on NK
cells. These findings raise the possibility that CD16 plays a
role in the induction of NKCAs by leukemic cells.

are compatible with the possibility that CD16 antigen
plays a role in the induction of NKCAs by leukemia
cells. Additional evidence in support of this possibility is
provided by CD16 higher expression on STNK than on
LTNK cells (data not shown).

Generation by long-term in vitro culture of NK
cell resistance to leukemia cell-induced NKCAs
To determine whether the duration of IL-2
incubation with NK cells affected their susceptibility
to NKCAs, we investigated the effect of ML-2 cells on
STNK and LTNK cell cultures. Figure 2 shows that STNK
cells were susceptible to AML cell-induced NKCAs as
indicated by a marked CD16 down-regulation (Figure 2,
upper, right panel), depletion of CD16+ cells (Figure 2,
lower, right panel) and induction of apoptosis of CD16+
and CD16- NK cells (Figure 2, lower, left panel). In
contrast, LTNK cells that displayed a strong lytic activity
(Figure 2, upper left, panel) were resistant to leukemia
cell-induced NKCAs. This conclusion is indicated by the
lack of significant difference between NK cells incubated
with ML-2 and control NK cells incubated without ML-2
cells to the extent of CD16 down-regulation as well as cell
apoptosis. These results indicate that long-term in vitro
culture of NK cells reduces their susceptibility to AML
cell-induced NKCAs. Similar results were obtained also
when STNK and LTNK cells were tested for their ability

CD16 involvement in the induction of NKCAs by
AML cells
To investigate a cause-effect relationship between
CD16 down-regulation and induction of NKCAs by
leukemia cells, CD16 was cross-linked by incubating
IL-2 stimulated short term NK (STNK) cells for 5 hours
at 37°C with ML-2 cells coated with the CD157-specific
mAb SY11B5. Although with some differences in the
degree of changes, mAb SY11B5 enhanced ML-2 cellinduced CD16 down-regulation (Figure 1 panel B) and
extent of apoptosis (Figure 1 panel C). The highest level of
NKCAs was observed when NK cells were incubated with
ML-2 cells and mAb SY11B5. Similar results were also
obtained with U937 cells (data not shown). These findings

Figure 2: Long-term culture condition protects NK cells, in vitro, from ML-2 cell-induced NKCAs. Following a 3 or
a 10-day activation with IL-2, NK cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C with 51Cr-labelled ML-2 cells at the indicated E/T cell ratio
(upper, left panel). For NKCAs: IL-2 stimulated PBMCs were cultured in the absence or presence of ML-2 at 4:1 E/T ratio. CD16MFI of
NK cells (upper, right panel), percentage of apoptosis (lower, left panel) and percentage of NK cells (lower, right panel) were evaluated in
the CD16+NK and CD16-NK cell subsets by flow cytometry.

to lyse the leukemia cell lines THP-1 and U937 and their
susceptibility to induction of NKCAs by these leukemia
cell lines (data not shown).
To determine the extent of damage induced by
ML-2 cells in STNK and LTNK cells both types of cells
were subjected to 2-consecutive rounds incubation, the
extent of damage induced in STNK cells by ML-2 cells
was significantly lower than that induced following the
first incubation with ML-2 cells (Figure 3, panels B, and
C). The reduced susceptibility of ML-2 cell-induced
NKCAs of STNK cells was associated with a decreased
anti-leukemia activity (Figure 3D, upper and lower left
panels). In contrast, following both the first and second
incubation, with ML-2 cells, LTNK cells were resistant
to ML-2 cells, and were effective in inducing damage
of ML-2 cells (Figure 3D, upper and lower right panels)
suggesting that ML-2 cells reduce the frequency of
STNK effector cells following their first incubation. Also,
following their first incubation with IL-2 cells, viable
STNK and LTNK cells, sorted from the NK and ML-2
cell preparation, induced a similar extent of ML-2 cell-

damage (Figure 3, panel E). These results suggest that
STNK cells are composed of at least two subpopulations:
one susceptible and the other one resistant to ML-2 cell
induced NKCAs.

Inhibition by LTNK cells of ML-2 cell growth in
CB17 scid mice
To compare the ability of LTNK and STNK cells
to inhibit the subcutaneous growth of leukemia cells,
ML-2 cells were mixed with LTNK cells or STNK cells
and injected subcutaneously into CB17-scid mice. ML-2
cells injected into mice without NK cells were used as
a reference control. LTNK cells significantly inhibited
leukemia cell growth (P = 0.001) while STNK cells did
not (Figure 4A). In addition, LTNK cells significantly
prolonged disease free survival (DFS) (P = 0.03) and
overall survival (OS) (P = 0.01) of leukemia bearing
mice as compared to STNK cells (Figure 4, 4B, and
4C).These data suggest that LTNK cell treatment is
associated with a favorable clinical course of the disease.

Figure 3: ML-2 cells reduces, in vitro, the frequency of short-term NK effector cells with anti-leukemia activity. IL-2

post-activated STNK and LTNK cells were subjected to a 2 consecutive rounds of incubation with ML-2 cells at a ratio of 4 STNK or
LTNK cells to 1 ML-2 cell at 37°C. Following a 5-hour and an 18-hour incubation of STNK and LTNK cells with ML-2 cells, cell aliquots
were harvested and stained with FITC-annexin-V, PI, PE-anti-CD16, and APC-anti-CD56 and analyzed by flow cytometry for CD16
down-regulation panel A., NK cell apoptosis panel B., NK cell depletion panel C. and ML-2 cell damage panel D. Also, following the first
incubation with ML-2 cells, STNK and LTNK cells were magnetically sorted from cell preparations and reincubated overnight with ML-2
cells at 37°C. Then, cells were stained with FITC-annexin-V and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. ML-2 cells were identified by posting
an electronic gate on cells with the highest forward and side scatters panel E.

Resistance to AML cell-induced NKCAs in the
long-term culture setting is IL-2 independent
and is in part mediated by MMPs inhibited by
TIMP3

significantly susceptible to ML-2 cell-induced NKCAs.
In addition,TAPI-0 inhibited the down-regulation of
CD16 on STNK cells, (Figure 5, panel C) and this effect
was also detected when PBMCs cultured without IL-2
were used as targets (Figure 5, panel D). Notably, TAPI0, at the concentration utilized did not alter the basal
expression of CD16 and the percentage of NK cells. It
reduced leukemia cell-induced CD16 down-regulation
(Figure 5, panel E) and NK cell depletion (Figure 5,
panel G) but did not affect leukemia cell-induced NK
cell apoptosis (Figure 5, panel F). These results suggest
that TIMP-3 inhibits ML-2 cell-induced CD16-downregulation and NK cell depletion but does not inhibit
NK cell apoptosis.

To investigate whether RNA transcription is
involved in the generation of NK cell resistance to
NKCAs, we tested the effect of actinomycin D on LTNK
cell culture. We utilized 10 ng/ml of actinomycin D
since this concentration did not affect the expression of
CD16 and the percentage of NK cells present in PBMC
preparations. Table 1 shows that following a 3-day culture
with ML-2 cells, STNK cells underwent NKCAs and
following a 10-day culture, LTNK cells became NKCA
resistant. In contrast, ML-2 cells induced a significant
down-regulation of CD16 expression (P = 0.004) and a
trend toward significant reduction in the NK cell number
(P = 0.09) in the PBMC preparations cultured in the
presence of actinomycin D. These results suggest that NK
cell RNA transcription is involved in the generation of
AML cell-induced NKCA.
MMP activation during NK cell/leukemia cell
conjugation has been recently shown to cause CD16
down-regulation in resting NK cells. Consistent with
this result, chemical inhibitors of MMPs have been
shown to inhibit CD16 down-regulation induced by
AML cells.[11] This finding provided us with the
rationale to test whether TIMP3, a potent endogenous
MMP inhibitor is involved in the inhibition of NKCA
induction by AML cells. To investigate this possibility,
we examined the IL-2 stimulated NK cells. As shown in
Figure 5, (panel A and B), following a 10-day culture,
IL-2 stimulated and resting LTNK cells were not

Role of TIMP3 in LTNK cell resistance to AML
cell-induced NKCAs
The ability of TAPI-0, to inhibit the induction of
CD16-down-regulation and cell depletion by AML cells
raised the possibility that TIMP3 may play a role in the
resistance of LTNK cells to AML cell-induced NKCAs.
To prove this possibility, we measured the expression
level of TIMP3 gene and protein in LTNK cells. LTNK
cells displayed levels of TIMP3 gene expression (Figure
5, upper panel H) and protein shedding (Figure 5, lower
panel H), in their culture supernatant, significantly higher
than those found in STNK cells. Thus, in LTNK cells
cultured at 37°C, the level of TIMP3 gene expression in
NK cells was about 50 times higher than that in NK cells
following a 3-day culture at 37°C. Similarly, following a 3
and a 10-day culture at 37°C, NK cells produced 2192±69
and 6963±59 pg/ml of soluble TIMP3, respectively. These

Following a 3 day of stimulation with IL-2, aliquots of PBMCs were harvested and utilized for the assessment of NKCAs
in the presence or absence of ML-2 cells. At the same time, actinomycin D (10 ng/ml) was added to the ongoing culture
of PBMCs. On day 10, PBMCs were harvested and incubated for 18 hours in the presence or absence of ML-2 cells.
NKCAs were evaluated by flow cytometry utilizing fluorescent conjugated anti-CD56, anti-CD16 and anti-CD3 mAbs.
For statistical analysis: % of CD16 down-regulation and % of NK cell frequency inhibition were calculated by dividing
CD16MFI and % of NK cell values obtained from PBMCs cultured in the presence of ML-2 cells by CD16 MFI and
% of NK cells values obtained from PBMCs cultured in the absence of ML-2 cells x100 respectively. For CD16 downregulation we obtained: 3 days vs 10 days: P = 0.0035, 10 days vs 10 days + actinomycin D: P = 0.004, 3 days vs 10

susceptibility of LTNK cells to AML cell-induced NKCAs.

may contribute to improving the therapeutic efficacy of
immunotherapy of AML cells with NK cells.
In agreement with the results reported by Jewett
et al. and by Grzywacz et al.[8, 11] we have found that
leukemia cells cause CD16 down-regulation on STNK
cells. This defect is likely to reflect MMP activation
induced by NK cell-AML cell conjugation. As a result,
CD16 antigen is trimmed and shed from NK cell surface.
[11] The key role of MMPs in the generation of this
abnormality is also supported by the ability of MMP
drug inhibitors to reverse the CD16 down-regulation in
NK cells induced by leukemia cells and phorbol ester
activation.[11, 17, 18] We have shown for the first time
that biological MMP inhibitors such as TIMPs can inhibit
CD16 down-regulation. We have focused our attention on
TIMP3 because of its unique ability to induce apoptosis in
normal and tumor cells in vitro.[19, 20]
CD16 antigen down-regulation is always associated
with NK cell apoptosis and depletion. This association
has been taken as evidence to suggest that CD16 antigen
triggering plays a role in AML cell-induced NKCAs.
In support of this possibility, a few studies have shown

DISCUSSION
The results, we have described, indicate that AML
cells induce abnormalities in a fraction of both CD16+
and CD16- NK cell-subsets. They include CD16 downregulation, NK cell apoptosis, and NK cell depletion.
NKCAs are reversed by long-term culture of NK cells
at 37°C; this is associated with an increased ability of
LTNK cells to inhibit subcutaneous ML-2 cell growth, in
CB17 scid mice, leading to a DFS and OS prolongation.
The resistance to NKCAs by LTNK cell culture which
involves RNA transcription is associated with TIMP3
over-expression in vitro.
Our results show that STNK cells are not
homogenously damaged by AML cells, but they
harbour NK cell that are not damaged by AML cells.

that cross-linking of CD16 antigen by the corresponding
mAbs induces NK cell apoptosis [12] and anergy in Fas+
NK cells. These cells, in the presence of endogenous
TNF-α, undergo apoptosis that is inhibited, in vitro, by
anti-TNF-α mAb; only a minor population of NK cells
remains cytotoxic and proliferates in the presence of
IL-2. These findings support a role for TNF-α in the
induction of NK cell apoptosis.[21] To reinforce the role
of CD16 in AML-induced NKCAs, we have shown that
cross-linking of CD16 on NK cells by the Fc fragment
of SY11B5, a mAb with specificity for CD157 antigen
expressed on leukemia cells but not on NK cells, induces
CD16 down-regulation and enhances NK cell apoptosis.
However, neither FAS nor TNF-α death pathways seem

to be involved in the induction of NK cell apoptosis
and depletion since NKCAs are not affected by caspase
blockade.[14] In addition, the CD56+CD16- NK cell
subset undergoes AML cell-induced apoptosis to the same
extent as the CD56+CD16+ NK cell subset. Furthermore,
TAPI-0 reduced CD16 down-regulation and NK cell
depletion but did not inhibit NK cell apoptosis suggesting
that TIMP3 may not play a role in AML cell-induced NK
cell apoptosis.
Because of the potential role of CD16 antigen in the
generation of AML cell- induced NKCAs, we investigated
whether the length of the in vitro incubation of NK cells
with IL-2 causes changes in CD16 cell surface expression,
STNK cells express a significantly higher CD16 expression

level than LTNK cells. The mechanism underlying this
difference is not readily apparent. One might speculate
that changes over time of CD16 expression on NK cells
are independent of MPP inhibition by TIMP3.[22, 23] Two
lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, TAPI-0
did not up-regulate CD16 expression on IL-2 stimulated
STNK cells; second TAPI-0 decreased TIMP3 gene
expression and protein secretion in IL-2 stimulated LTNK
cells as compared to resting NK cells (data not shown). It
is tempting to speculate that a population of NK cells with
low or intermediate CD16 expression may be selected
from a long-term NK cell culture. These results prompted
us to test, in vitro and in vivo, the effect of AML cells on
STNK and LTNK cells. LTNK cells become resistant to
leukemia cell-induced NKCAs and this phenomenon is
associated with an apparent anti-AML cell activity, in vivo,
leading to AML cell growth inhibition in immunodeficient
mice and, in vitro, TIMP3 over-expression in NK cells.
It is important to highlight that subcutaneous injection
of IL-2 stimulated STNK cells in the presence of ML-2
cells, in CB17 scid mice, does not inhibit leukemia growth
and has no effect on the clinical course of the disease. In
this context, we can hypothesize that NKCA induced by
ML-2 cells on STNK cells decreases their anti-leukemia
potential.The lack of anti-leukemia activity of STNK
cells, in vitro and in vivo, may reflect a reduction in the
frequency of the functionally active NK cells due to the
harmful effects of AML cells on STNK cells but not on
LTNK cells. NKCA resistance to cancer cells became
detectable following a 7-day culture and reached its peak
on day 10 of NK cell culture. Based on this information
one may speculate that the reduced expression of cell
surface CD16 antigen may protect LTNK cells from AML
cell-induced NKCAs. This kinetics is compatible with the
possibility that changes in RNA transcription and protein
synthesis are involved in the development of LTNK cell
resistance to ML-2 cells. Indeed, LTNK cells cultured
in the presence of actinomycin D for 10 days lost their
resistance to ML-2 cells indicating that ML-2 cell-induced
NKCAs involve RNA transcription.
TAPI-0 has inhibitory activity on a few MMPs
including ADAM9, ADAM17, and MMP-1, 3, 9, and 13.
[22, 23] Since TAPI-0 inhibited CD16 down-regulation
and NK cell depletion, MMP inhibitors may be utilized
to reduce STNK cell susceptibility to AML cell-induced
NKCAs. On the other hand, Romee et al. demonstrated
that a disintegrin and ADAM17 regulate CD16 expression
on NK cells.[24] Furthermore, Wiernik et al. showed
that ADAM17 inhibition enhances the cytotoxic activity
of NK cells against myeloid leukemia cells by the antiCD16xanti-CD33 bispecific antibody. [25] The high
resemblance of TIMP3 and TAPI-0 in their functional
activity suggests that TIMP3 could play a role in the
induction of the mechanism by which LTNK cells become
resistant to AML cell-induced NKCAs. LTNK cells may
acquire the ability to increase TIMP3 gene transcription
and protein release in the culture supernatant. Then,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

soluble TIMP3 could interfere with MMP activation
mediated by malignant cells.
Our data suggest that mechanism(s) underlying
resistance of NK cells could be utilized to improve
haploidentical or allogeneic LTNK and STNK-cell-based
immunotherapy for hematological malignancies. In this
context, the optimization of methodologies aimed at
producing a good manufacturing practice expansion of
LTNK cells may lead to their clinical implementation in
the therapy of AML.[1–3] Also, the inhibition of AML
cell-induced STNK cell abnormalities by drug mimicking
the effects of TIMP3 such as TAPI-0[26] on STNK cells
may allow STNK cells to be utilized to fight AML disease.

eBioscience (San Diego, CA). RPMI 1640 medium was
purchased from Lonza (Milan, Italy). Recombinant IL-2
was obtained from Chiron Corporation (Emeryville, CA).

Cell lines
The human myeloid leukemia cell lines ML-2,
THP-1 and U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
glutamine (10 mg/ml), penicillin (10U/ml) and streptomycin
(10 mg/ml). Cells are part of our cell line laboratory
collection. The identity of the ML-2 and U937 cell lines is
monitored by a phenotypic analysis of cell surface markers.
The latter is identified as CD45+HLA-A2-chondroytin
sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG) 4+ while the former is
identified as CD45+HLA-A2+CSPG4+. The identity of
the THP-1 cells is monitored by the analysis of cell surface
expression of CD45 and Fc receptor and by HLA class II
allele genotyping including DRW1 and DRW2.

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs)
PBMCs isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation from buffy coats obtained from
the University of Tor Vergata Blood Bank donors. Lowdensity peripheral blood lymphocytes (LD-PBLs) were
isolated as previously described.[13] PBMCs and LDPBLs were activated with IL-2 (200 U/mL) for 3-16 days
at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS; this medium is referred to as a complete medium
(CM). CD56+ cells and NK cells were isolated utilizing

anti-CD56 magnetic beads and the NK cell isolation kit,
respectively (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA).

Following TRIzol based isolation (Life Technologies
Italia, Monza, Italy) from cells, total RNA was subjected to
reverse transcription using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR of
TIMP3 and β-actin was performed using the TaqMan
universal PCR master mix. Primers and probes of TIMP3
were purchased, from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA) as a kit assay product, Hs00165949_m1 (TIMP3).
Gene expression was quantified as previously described.
[16] Gene expression was normalized on the b-actin
housekeeping gene.

Flow cytometry analysis
PBMCs or magnetically sorted CD56+ cells were
mixed with leukemia cells at different E/T ratio. Following
a 5-18-hour incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere,
cells were harvested, incubated for 30 min at 4°C with PEconjugated anti-CD16 mAb, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD3
mAb, APC-conjugated anti-CD56 mAb, Then, cells were
incubated for 15 min at room temperature, in the dark,
with FITC-annexin-V and analyzed as already described.
[14] Results were analyzed utilizing the BD Cell Quests
and the Tree Star Inc. flowJo software.

Statistical analysis

Cytotoxicity assay

Results were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney test
or a paired-T-test. DFS and OS results were evaluated by
a Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Differences were considered
significant when the p value was < 0.05.

The standard 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay was
performed as described.[15] Maximum Cr release was
measured by incubating target cells with 5% triton-X-100.
Percent of specific lysis was calculated utilizing the
formula: (experimental release-spontaneous release) /
(maximum release-spontaneous release) × 100. The
spontaneous release was less than 10%.

Mice

GRANT SUPPORT

Ten-week-old male CB17 SCID mice were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories (Lecco, Italy) and housed
in laminar flow cages. Mice were fed with sterile food
and water. Mouse age at the beginning of the experiments
ranged between 20-22 weeks. Mice endogenous NK cell
activity was inhibited by an intraperitoneal injection of
50 ml of anti-asialo GM1 antiserum (Wako, Chemicals,
Richmond, VA,) on day -3, 0, +14 and +21 utilizing as a
reference time that of a subcutaneous injection of ML-2
cells or ML-2 plus NK cells.

In vivo anti-leukemia activity of short term and
long term NK cells

Editorial note

PBMCs were cultured in CM at 37°C. Following
a 3-day and a 10-day culture, PBMCs were harvested,
and NK cells were negatively sorted (95% purity). Then
ML-2 cells (4 × 106) were mixed with 3-day cultured NK
cells (12 × 106), or with 10-day cultured NK cells (12 ×
106), hereafter referred to as short term NK (STNK)
cells, and long-term NK (LTNK) cells, respectively. Cell
mixtures were resuspended in PBS supplemented with
matrigel (Corning, Tewksbury, MA). Following a 30-min
incubation at 37°C, 4 mice were injected with an ML-2STNK cell suspension and 4 with an ML-2-LTNK cell
suspension. Eight mice were injected with an ML-2 cell
suspension and used as a control. Subcutaneous ML-2
cell growth was monitored 3 times weekly with calipers.
Tumor volume (TV) was calculated using the formula: TV
(cm3)=4/3p r3, where r=(length + width)/4. When tumor
volume exceeded 2 cm3, a mouse was sacrificed.
