Both agonists and antagonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I) are effective treatments for benign prostatic
hyperplasia and androgen-dependent prostate cancers (3). These
GnRH analogues down-regulate or antagonize the GnRH receptor
in the pituitary, thus causing a substantial decrease in serum
gonadotropin and androgen levels (4–6). Although these pituitarymediated GnRH actions are useful only for androgen-dependent
prostate cancer, GnRH-I also has direct actions on both androgendependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
GnRH-I agonists directly inhibit epidermal growth factor–induced
or insulin-like growth factor–induced prostate cancer cell proliferation (7, 8) and directly induce apoptosis of serum-deprived
[0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing media] cancer cells. The
latter effect may be meditated by the GnRH-I receptor, which
triggers Gi-mediated activation of apoptotic signaling proteins,
including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; refs. 9, 10).
Like GnRH-I, GnRH-II functions in human reproductive and
immune tissues (11–14). Little is known, however, about the
functional significance of GnRH-II in prostate cancer. GnRH-II is
found to be more potent than GnRH-I in inhibiting human
endometrial and ovarian cancer cell proliferation (15). GnRH-II
produced by human T cells induces laminin receptor gene
expression and cell migration (16). Our laboratory and other
groups have identified GnRH-II receptors in a variety of nonmammalian species, as well as in monkey (17–19). In humans,
GnRH-II receptor genes are localized to chromosomes 1 and 14.
Although mRNAs for these genes are expressed in a variety of
tissues, including the brain, they are thought to be nonfunctional
pseudogenes due to the introduction of a premature stop codon
(20, 21). The absence of a functional human GnRH-II receptor has
led to the proposal that the actions of GnRH-II are mediated by the
GnRH-I receptor (22). However, some pharmacologic studies
support the existence of a functional GnRH-II receptor that is
distinct from the conventional GnRH-I receptor in structure. For
instance, GnRH-II–induced laminin receptor gene expression is not
blocked by the GnRH-I antagonist cetrorelix (16). In addition,
GnRH-II retains the ability to inhibit proliferation of ovarian cancer
cells in which GnRH-I receptor has been knocked down (15).
The involvement of a novel protein in GnRH-II action is further
supported by our recent observation that radiolabeled GnRH-II is
able to bind a variety of human prostate cancer cells (23). This
binding is displaced by unlabeled GnRH-II, but not by GnRH-I.
Photoaffinity labeling with 125I-[azidobenzoyl-D-Lys6]GnRH-II
revealed that GnRH-II specifically bind to a protein with a mass
of 80 kDa, around 30 to 40 kDa larger than the GnRH-I receptor
(9, 24). Recently, we developed a novel GnRH-II antagonist, known
as trptorelix-1 (Trp-1; refs. 25, 26). This antagonist is able to induce

Abstract
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I (GnRH-I) is known to
directly regulate prostate cancer cell proliferation. However,
the role of GnRH-II in prostate cancer is unclear. Here, we
investigated the effect of the GnRH-II antagonist trptorelix-1
(Trp-1) on growth of PC3 prostate cancer cells. Trp-1 induced
growth inhibition of PC3 cells in vitro and inhibited growth of
PC3 cells xenografted into nude mice. FITC-N3, an FITCconjugated Trp-1 analogue, was largely present in the
mitochondria of prostate cancer cells, but not in other cells
that are not derived from the prostate. Trp-1–induced PC3
growth inhibition was associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Growth
inhibition was partially prevented by cotreating cells with Nacetyl cysteine, an antioxidant. Cytochrome c release and
caspase-3 activation were not detected in Trp-1–treated cells.
However, Trp-1 induced autophagosome formation, as seen by
increased LysoTracker staining and recruitment of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 to these new lysosomal
compartments. Trp-1–induced autophagy was accompanied
by decreased AKT phosphorylation and increased c-Jun NH2
terminal kinase phosphorylation, two events known to be
linked to autophagy. Taken together, these data suggest that
Trp-1 directly induces mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS
increase, leading to autophagy of prostate cancer cells. GnRHII antagonists may hold promise in the treatment of prostate
cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):923–31]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men and the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in western countries
(1). In early stages of prostate cancer, androgen deprivation is useful
for suppression of tumor growth. However, this initial regression in
growth is followed by resistance to androgen deficiency, resulting
in aggressive and metastatic tumors that are fatal (2). For this
reason, development of effective drugs for treatment of androgenindependent prostate cancer is of utmost importance.

were collected (e.g., heart, intestine, kidney, liver, pituitary, and spleen).
Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342
(1 Ag/mL) for 5 min, and FICT-N3 localization was analyzed with an IX70
fluorescence microscope (Olympus) equipped with a digital Cool CCD
camera (CoolSNAP fx CCD Camera, Roper Scientific).
Subcellular localization of FITC-N3. PC3, DU145, HeLa, DLD, MCF7,
WI38, and aT3 cells were plated on poly-D-lysine–coated glass coverslips in
12-well plates. After 2 d, the cells were treated at 37jC with 66 nmol/L
MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) for 30 min and then with 10 Amol/L of
FITC-N3 for 10 min. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min
and mounted. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 3342 (10 Ag/mL;
Molecular Probes). Fluorescence labeling was visualized under an LSM510
confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Measurement of intracellular ROS. ROS were measured using the
fluoroprobes, 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma) and
MitoSOX (Molecular Probes). Approximately, 8  104 cells were plated on
60-mm dishes, cultured in 5% FBS RPMI media, and treated with the
indicated agent for 3 d. After treatment, cells were incubated in the dark
with 50 Amol/L DCF-DA or 0.5 Amol/L MitoSOX for 30 min at 37jC. Cells
were resuspended in 500 AL 0.2% SDS and transferred to a 96-well plate in
duplicate. DCF-DA fluorescence was measured by spectrophotometer
(GENios Plus, TECAN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fluorescence was normalized to the number of viable cells. DCF-DA and
MitoSOX fluorescence was also analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Mitochondrial membrane potential was
measured using 5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes). In healthy cells, JC-1 forms
aggregates within mitochondria, generating red fluorescence. However,
during mitochondrial depolarization, JC-1 monomers diffuse throughout
the cell, producing green fluorescence. Stock solutions of JC-1 (2.5 mg/mL)
were prepared in DMSO. After treatment with the indicated agents for 3 d,
cells were incubated in PBS containing JC-1 (2.5 Ag/mL) for 20 min at room
temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 500 AL PBS.
Fluorescence was then measured using the FACSCalibur system.
Autophagosome formation. PC3 cells were incubated with 50 nmol/L
LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room
temperature to label lysosomes. In addition, cells were transfected with
vector encoding yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)–fused light chain 3
(LC3) to monitor lysosomal recruitment of LC3. The YFP-LC3 construct
was generated by cloning LC3 cDNA into EcoRI-cleaved and SalI-cleaved
YFP-C1. LC3 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription–PCR using the
primer set 5¶-CCGGAATTCTACCATGCCCTCAGACCGGCCTTTC-3¶ and
5¶-GCCGGTCGACTCAGAAGCCGAAGGTTTCCTG-3¶. After YFP-LC3 transfection, PC3 cells were treated with Trp-1 for 3 d. Fluorescent-labeled LC3
and lysosomes were then visualized under a confocal microscope.
Western blot analysis. PC3 cells (5  105) were plated in 100-mm dishes
and treated with 10 Amol/L Trp-1 for 3 d. Cells were harvested and
incubated in buffer A [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mmol/L KCl,
0.5 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] for 30 min on
ice. The cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer using 20 strokes
and centrifuged at 5,900  g for 10 min to collect the cytosolic fraction. The
resulting pellets were resuspended in cold buffer A, briefly sonicated thrice,
and centrifuged at 5,900  g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant, which
contained a crude preparation of mitochondrial proteins, was then
collected. Proteins (20 Ag) were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin
and incubated with one of the following primary antibodies: cytochrome c
(Pharmingen), caspase-3 (Pharmigen), AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
phosphorylated AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated mTOR
(Cell Signaling Technology), mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling Technology), S6 ribosomal
protein (Cell Signaling Technology), JNK (Cell Signaling Technology),
phosphorylated JNK (Cell Signaling Technology), extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated ERK

prostate cancer cell death, whereas the GnRH-I antagonist
cetrorelix fails to do so (23). However, the mechanism underlying
the Trp-1–induced prostate cancer cell death has been poorly
understood. Here, we investigated the growth inhibitory effects
of Trp-1 on PC3 human androgen-independent cells in vivo and
examined the possible mechanism of cell death through mitochondrial dysfunction followed by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production and autophagy of prostate cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
GnRH analogues. The GnRH-II analogues Trp-1 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Cit-Trp-Tyr-Pro-D-Ala-NH2], N1 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Arg-Trp-Tyr-Pro-D-Ala-NH2], N2 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Arg-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2], N3 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Lys-Trp-Tyr-Pro-D-Ala-NH2], N4 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Lys-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2], N5 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Cit-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH2], N6 [Ac-D-Nal(2)-DPhe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Cit-Trp-D-Tyr-Pro-D-Ala-NH2], N7 [Ac-D-Nal(2)D-Phe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-D-Cit-Trp-Leu-Pro-D-Ala-NH2], and FITC-N3
[Ac-D-Nal(2)-D-Phe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-Ser-Tyr-FITC-D-Lys-Trp-Tyr-Pro- D-AlaNH2], as well as [FITC-D-Lys6]GnRH-II, GnRH-II, and GnRH-I, were
synthesized by AnyGen. Cetrorelix [Ac-D-Nal(2)-D-Phe(4Cl)-D-Pal(3)-SerTyr-D-Cit-Leu-Arg-Pro-D-Ala-NH2] was obtained from ASTA Medica AG.
Cell culture. PC3 and LNCaP cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection and cultured at 37jC in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heatinactivated FBS, 100 units penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Other
cells, such as DU145, ALVA51, MCF7, DLD, WI38, HeLa, aT3, and GH3GII
cells, were cultured at 37jC in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
Cell viability. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates in triplicate (1  104
per well) and cultured in DMEM containing 0.1% or 5% FBS. After 24 h, cells
were treated with the indicated concentration of Trp-1 solubilized in 0.1%
DMSO or Trp-1–related compound every 24 h for 3 d. After treatment, cells
were washed with PBS, dissociated with trypsin/EDTA, and resuspended in
500 AL complete growth media. Cell suspensions were incubated with
trypan blue (0.4%), and dye-excluding cells were counted under an inverted
optical microscope (Olympus).
In vivo growth of prostate cancer cells. Six-week-old female athymic
(BALB/c-nu) mice were obtained from Harlan. Mice were housed under
pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated caging system (Tecniplast) with g-irradiated laboratory chow (LabDiet, PMI) and sterilized water
ad libitum. All animal experiments and procedures were performed after
receiving approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Clinical Research Institute in Seoul National University Hospital
(Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care–accredited facility). PC3 cells (6  106) were injected into the right
flank. After 2 d, animals were s.c. injected with 0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 mg of Trp-1
(200 AL in 5% N,N-dimethylacetamide, 40% propylene glycol, and 45%
distilled water) for 21 consecutive days. After 9 d, all animals had developed
tumors with a volume of around 20 mm3; tumor volumes were measured
every 2 d. Tumor volumes were measured by determining two perpendicular dimensions [length (L) and width (W)] and the height (H) using vernier
calipers and calculated using the formula V = (p/6)  (W  L  H). The
mice were sacrificed after 21 d of treatment, and livers were isolated and
fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde. Histopathologic analysis of liver tissue
was performed by Asan Hospital. Biochemical analysis of serum was
performed by Chemon to test for liver and kidney toxicity. In separate
experiments, to exclude the possible involvement of ovarian factors in
tumor growth, the mice were ovariectomized under anesthesia (isoflurane).
One week later, PC3 cells (8  106) were injected into the right flank of the
mice. After 10 d, all animals had developed solid tumors of f30 to 40 mm3.
At this time, treatment was initiated. The mice were s.c. injected with
0.1 mg Trp-1 or cetrorelix dissolved in 200 AL of 5% N,N-dimethylacetamide,
40% propylene glycol, and 45% distilled water for 10 consecutive days. To
determine the tissue distribution of Trp-1, 0.1 mg of FITC-N3 was s.c. given
to mice bearing PC3 tumors. One day later, the tumor tissue and organs

(Cell Signaling Technology), or h-actin (Sigma). Membranes were then
incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody, and protein signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).
Immunocytochemistry. PC3 cells (4  104) were plated on glass
coverslips in six-well plates and treated with 10 Amol/L Trp-1 for 3 d. Cells
were incubated in 66 nmol/L MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) for 30 min to
label mitochondria and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.
The cells were permeabilized with PBST (0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min,
blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 30 min, incubated with
cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) for 3 h, and incubated with Alexa
594–conjugated antimouse antibody for 1 h. Cells were stained with either
Alexa 488–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa 594–conjugated
antimouse antibody. Cells were then stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 Ag/mL)
for 5 min, mounted onto slides, and observed under a laser scanning
confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using PRISM4 software
(GraphPad). Group means were compared using Student’s t test or oneway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. P < 0.05 was
accepted as significant.

lines were treated with 10 Amol/L Trp-1 under 0.1% (Fig. 1B) and
5% (Fig. 1C) serum conditions. Treatment with Trp-1 for 2 days
under 0.1% serum condition drastically inhibited the growth of
prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, PC3, ALVA41, and DU145 cells, but
not the growth of MCF7 (breast cancer) and HeLa (cervical cancer)
cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment with Trp-1 for 3 days under 5% serum
condition significantly inhibited the growth of PC3 and DU145 cells
by >50% (Fig. 1C). However, growth of HeLa, DLD (colon cancer),
MCF7, and WI38 (lung fibroblast) cells was unaffected by Trp-1
(Fig. 1C). In PC3 cells, the growth-inhibiting effects of the GnRH-I
antagonist cetrorelix and the Trp-1–derived analogues N1 to N7
were also investigated. Treatment of PC3 cells with N3 for 2 days
under 0.1% serum condition inhibited growth (f93%; Fig. 1D),
indicating that substitution of D-Lys of Trp-1 for D-Cit does not
affect growth-inhibiting activity. N4 and N5 inhibited PC3 growth
by f40%, whereas cetrorelix, N1, N2, N6, and N7 only had a
marginal effect on growth (Fig. 1D).
Effect of Trp-1 on in vivo tumor growth. Nude mice bearing
PC3-derived tumors were treated with various concentrations of
Trp-1 for 21 consecutive days. Treatment with 0.001 mg Trp-1
decreased tumor volume by 35%, 0.01 mg Trp-1 by 52%, and 0.1 mg
Trp-1 by 60% (compared with vehicle-treated group; Fig. 2A). Body
weight did not vary significantly among the control and Trp-1–
treated groups (data not shown). To exclude the possible
involvement of ovarian factors in tumor growth, we examined
the effects of Trp-1 and cetrorelix on PC3 cell growth in
ovariectomized nude mice. Trp-1 induced a significant growth
retardation of the tumor, but cetrorelix failed to do so (Fig. 2B).
To determine whether Trp-1 acts specifically on tumor cells, we
analyzed the tissue distribution of FITC-conjugated N3 (0.1 mg).
One day after administration, FITC-N3 had accumulated in the PC3
tumor (Fig. 2C). No FITC-N3 was detected in the heart, intestine,
pituitary, or spleen, whereas slight amounts of FITC-N3 were

Prostate cancer cell–specific growth inhibition by Trp-1
in vitro. PC3 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L Trp-1 in culture
media with different concentrations of FBS. When cells were
cultured in low concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) of
serum, Trp-1 induced 80% to 95% growth inhibition of PC3 cells
within 3 days. However, increasing serum concentration up to 5%
and 10% significantly retarded growth inhibition of PC3 cells.
Treatment of Trp-1 for 5 days induced 43% and 22% growth
inhibition of PC cells in 5% and 10% serum condition, respectively
(Fig. 1A). This result suggests that the effect of Trp-1 is highly
dependent on serum concentration in culture media. To determine

Mice bearing PC-3 tumor were given
0.1 mg of FITC-N3 for 1 d. Tissues were
fixed with 4% parformaldehyde, and nuclei
were stained with Hoechst 33342. FITC-N3
fluorescence was observed under a
fluorescence microscope. Scale bars,
100 Am.

Isolation of N3-binding proteins by affinity chromatography
yielded a mixture of proteins with masses of f80 kDa. Liquid
chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry identified these proteins to be glucose-regulated protein 75
(GRP75; 75 kDa), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein
(TRAP-1; 80 kDa), and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacylCoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase (trifunctional protein) a subunit
(HADHA; 82 kDa; Supplementary Fig. S8). All three proteins are
found in the mitochondria, in good agreement with the
mitochondrial localization of the GnRH-II analogues.
Mitochondrial damage and ROS induction in Trp-1–treated
cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant increase in ROS
formation are thought to promote cell death through induction of
apoptotic signaling or autophagy (27, 28). The finding that FITC-N3
accumulated in the mitochondria prompted us to investigate
whether Trp-1 may induce prostate cancer cell death by altering
mitochondrial function. As shown in Fig. 4A, a 3-day treatment of
PC3 cells with Trp-1 decreased red fluorescence intensity,
indicative of a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential
(DCm). The geometric mean of green fluorescence intensity also
increased by 30% in cells treated with Trp-1. Trp-1 treatment also
increased cytoplasmic H2O2 levels in a dose-dependent manner, as
measured by fluorescence of a fluoroprobe, DCF-DA (Fig. 4B). Trp1 treatment also increased mitochondrial O2 levels, as determined
by the fluorescence of MitoSOX (Fig. 4C). The geometric mean
fluorescence intensities were significantly (63%) increased by Trp-1,
but not by cetrorelix (Fig. 4C). To determine whether this increase
in ROS was responsible for PC3 cell growth inhibition, we tested
the effect of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on the
viability of Trp-1–treated cells. Pretreatment of PC3 cells with NAC

detected in the kidney and liver (Fig. 2C). Histologic and blood
chemistry analyses were performed to determine if the Trp-1
treatment was toxic to the latter two tissues. Liver tissue from mice
treated with Trp-1 exhibited no histopathologic abnormalities
(data not shown). In addition, serum levels of alkaline phosphatase,
aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea
nitrogen, creatinine, and total bilirubin did not differ between
Trp-1–treated and control mice (data not shown). Thus, long-term
Trp-1 treatment has negligible toxicity on the liver and kidney.
Mitochondrial accumulation of FITC-N3. Analysis of the
subcellular distribution of FITC-N3 (1 Amol/L) in PC3 and DU145
cells revealed that, after a 10-minute treatment, FITC-N3 was
primarily present in the mitochondria, as seen by overlap between
FITC and MitoTracker dye (Fig. 3). FITC-N3 also accumulated in
aT3 cells, a mouse pituitary cell line that expresses the GnRH-I
receptor type. In these cells, FITC-N3 appeared as cytoplasmic
punctae that did not colocalize with mitochondria (Fig. 3). FITC-N3
was barely detectable in HeLa, DLD, MCF7, and WI38 cells. Like
FITC-N3, FITC-conjugated GnRH-II accumulated in the mitochondria of PC3 and DU145 cells but was scarcely detected in HeLa,
CV-1, and WI38 cells. FITC-conjugated GnRH-II also accumulated
in mitochondria of ALVA41 prostate cancer cells. In GH3 rat
pituitary tumor cells expressing monkey GH3GII (GnRH-II
receptor; ref. 26), FITC-GnRH-II was primarily localized outside
of the mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Mitochondrial
accumulation of FITC-GnRH-II was greatly decreased when PC3
cells were preincubated with unlabeled GnRH-II, Trp-1, or N3 for
1 h before FITC-GnRH-II treatment. Preincubation of these cells
with cetrorelix did not decrease the FITC-GnRH-II accumulation
(Supplementary Fig. S7B).

Trp-1 does not induce cytochrome c release or caspase-3
activation. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is an early
event during caspase-dependent cell death. Cytochrome c then
interacts with the cytoplasmic proteins Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to
form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-3 and initiates the

suppressed Trp-1–induced increases in ROS levels (data not
shown). Trypan blue dye exclusion assays revealed that NAC
alone did not alter the number of viable cells. However,
pretreatment with NAC partially suppressed Trp-1–induced cell
death (Fig. 4D).

exposure, we investigated whether Trp-1 may inhibit cell growth by
inducing autophagy. Treatment of PC3 cells with increasing
concentrations of Trp-1 resulted in a progressive increase in
LysoTracker staining, which had a punctuate appearance (Fig. 6A).
To provide additional support for Trp-1–induced autophagy, we
transfected PC3 cells with plasmid encoding YFP-tagged microtubule-associated protein 1 LC3. LC3 is a well-established marker of
autophagosome formation (30). During autophagy, LC3 proform is
cleaved into a soluble form, known as LC3-1. LC3-1 is further
processed to a membrane-bound form, LC3-II, which is recruited
onto autophagosomes. Autophagosomes engulfing organelles then
fuse with lysosomes and mature into the autolysosomes. YFP-LC3
was spread throughout untreated PC3 cells but appeared as
punctuate forms in Trp-1–treated cells (Fig. 6B). These YFP-LC3
punctae largely overlapped with LysoTracker staining, indicating
formation of autolysosome in Trp-1–treated cells. These autophagosome-like structures were absent in PC3 cells cotreated with
3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor (Fig. 6B). Because
autophagy is associated with altered levels of protein kinases, such
as AKT and microtubule-associated protein kinases (31, 32), we
analyzed levels of phosphorylation of autophagy-related proteins.
Trp-1 decreased AKT phosphorylation. This decreased phosphorylated AKT levels was accompanied with decreased protein levels
of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and S6 proteins. Trp-1
greatly increased JNK phosphorylation, a cell stress marker,
although it did not alter phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
GnRH-I is able to inhibit growth of sex steroid-regulated cancer
cells, including prostate cancer cells, not only by decreasing
gonadotropin and sex steroid levels but also by directly activating
cell death pathways in these cells (9, 10, 15). The finding that
GnRH-II has functions in the human reproductive and immune
systems (11–16, 33) intimates that GnRH-II may exert similar
effects in human prostate cancer. The present study shows that
Trp-1 exerts a growth inhibitory effect on androgen-independent
PC3 cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this growth inhibitory
effect seems to be highly specific for prostate cancer, as Trp-1 does
not inhibit the growth of breast, cervical, lung, and colon cancer
cells. Accordingly, FITC-N3 largely accumulated in the xenografted
PC3 cells, but not in other tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney,
intestine, spleen, and pituitary. No adverse effects of long-term
Trp-1 treatment have been observed in the xenografted mice,
suggesting that Trp-1 can be used for the treatment of androgenindependent prostate cancer cells.
Whereas the growth inhibitory effect of the GnRH-II analogues
in steroid-related cancer cells is evident, the mechanism
underlying GnRH-II antagonist-mediated growth inhibition of
these cells is poorly understood. The GnRH-I receptor–mediated
signaling pathway in cancer cells is quite complicated and is
distinct from GnRH-I receptor–mediated pathways in the
pituitary. In the pituitary, GnRH-I receptors are preferentially
coupled to Gq/11, resulting in activation of phospholipase C and
protein kinase C signaling pathways (34). In cancer cells, GnRH-I
receptors are linked to Gi (10), although these cells have
functional Gq/11/phospholipase C machinery (23). In addition,
in serum-deprived cancer cells, GnRH-I agonists may activate
JNK-mediated signaling and concomitantly reduce phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling (9). The finding that
GnRH-I antagonists have the same antiproliferative effects in

dismantling of the cell (29). Western blot analysis revealed that
Trp-1–treated PC3 cells contained no detectable processed
caspase-3 fragments, an indication of caspase activation
(Fig. 5A). As a positive control for caspase activation, we used
staurosporin. The active form of caspase-3 has been determined in
cells treated with 1 Amol/L staurosporin (Fig. 5A) Moreover, no
decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c was observed and no
cytosolic cytochrome c could be detected (Fig. 5B). Cytochrome
c release was also examined using laser scanning confocal
microscopy. Trp-1–exposed cells had shrunken nuclei, and their
mitochondria were largely aggregated in the perinuclear area
(Fig. 5C). No cytochrome c release was, however, observed
(Fig. 5C).

c release and caspase activation were not observed after Trp-1

specifically binds to GnRH-II (23). The discovery that GRP75,
TRAP-1, and HADHA bind the GnRH-II analogue N3 and are all
f80-kDa mitochondrial proteins is in good agreement with our
previous observation (23). This finding is further supported by the
fact that FITC-N3 largely accumulated in the mitochondria of
prostate cancer cell lines. However, this finding does not fully
explain the mechanism by which FITC-N3 penetrates the outer
membrane of prostate cancer cells, as we failed to characterize a
plasma membrane protein as a GnRH-II antagonist binding
protein. One reason for this failure is likely that interaction
between the GnRH-II antagonist and a protein in the plasma
membrane of prostate cancer cells is highly reversible.
Mitochondrial proteins participate in a host of processes,
including mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, ROS formation,
and electron transport (28, 31, 37, 38). Disturbance of these
mitochondrial functions is capable of triggering cell death through
activation of either apoptotic or autophagic pathways (27, 28, 38).
The mitochondrial accumulation of GnRH-II analogues in prostate
cancer cells is consistent with the hypothesis that Trp-1 inhibits
mitochondrial function, leading to growth inhibition and cell
death. In accord with this idea, Trp-1 significantly decreased
mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial
and cytoplasmic ROS levels. The ability of NAC to restore cell
growth in the presence of Trp-1 shows that ROS partly mediate the
antigrowth effects of Trp-1. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is
often associated with mitochondrial cytochrome c release and
subsequent caspase-3 activation (29), neither event was observed in

the steroid-regulated cancer cells as GnRH-I agonists adds to the
complexity of this system (15, 35).
Participation of the GnRH-I receptor in GnRH actions in cancer
cells is also under debate. Knockdown of the GnRH-I receptor in
ovarian and endometrial cancer cells abrogates the antigrowth
effect of GnRH-I, but not that of GnRH-II agonist (15). Similarly,
GnRH-I receptor-independent growth inhibition has been observed
in GnRH-II–treated human T cells (16). GnRH-II may achieve this
effect via two possible mechanisms. First, GnRH-II may act through
a GnRH-II receptor complex. The human GnRH-II receptor gene
encodes a partial peptide that interacts with other molecules, such
as the GnRH-I receptor, to form a GnRH-II–responsive complex,
which mediates the effects of GnRH-II in steroid-regulated cancer
cells. Indeed, Eicke and colleagues (36) showed GnRH-II receptor–
like antigenicity in the human placenta and reproductive organ
cancers. Alternatively, it can be proposed that GnRH-II acts
through an uncharacterized GnRH receptor that is pharmacologically distinct from the conventional GnRH-I receptor (23).
Cytoplasmic accumulation pattern of FITC-N3 in prostate cancer
cells differs from that observed in aT3 cells expressing the type-I
GnRH receptor. In aT3 cells, FITC-N3 was primarily present as
punctae in the cytoplasm, with partial overlap in the mitochondria.
Thus, it can be postulated that, in prostate cancer cells, FITC-N3
enters through a prostate cancer cell membrane–specific mechanism, which is distinct from GnRH receptor–mediated endocytosis.
Using photoaffinity labeling, we have previously identified a
putative 80-kDa protein in human prostate cancer cells that

membrane disruption and caspase-3 activation. However, no
evidence of autophagic cell death was provided in these cells.
How similar compounds are able to activate different cell death
pathways is not clear. Rotenone and TTFA, the mitochondrial
electron-transport-chain inhibitors, induce apoptosis in primary
mouse astrocytes by autophagic death in transformed HEK 293 and
U87 cells (28). Thus, cell death pathways may be cell type–
dependent whereas additional studies will be necessary to clarify
this differential activation of cell death pathways.
In summary, our data clearly show that the GnRH-II antagonist
Trp-1 exerts a growth inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cells
in vitro and in vivo. Accumulation of FITC-conjugated GnRH-II
analogue in the mitochondria of the prostate cancer cells suggests
that Trp-1 may directly act on the mitochondria to disrupt
mitochondrial function, leading to increase ROS production and
autophagy of prostate cancer cells. This novel mechanism
underlying prostate cancer growth inhibition supports the use of
GnRH-II antagonists in treating prostate cancer.

Trp-1–exposed cells. Thus, Trp-1–induced cell growth inhibition is
likely independent of caspase activation. Rather, Trp-1 is more
likely to induce autophagic cell death based on the finding that this
analogue increases LysoTracker staining and the recruitment of
YFP-LC3 into the lysosomal membrane.
Autophagy is characterized by sequestration of bulk cytoplasm
and organelles in autophagic vesicles, which are eventually
degraded by the lysosomal system. This process is activated by
nutrient starvation and promotes cellular adaptation and survival
in response to stress (29, 39). Excess autophagy, on the other hand,
leads to cell death (29). A large body of data shows that some
malignant cell types undergo autophagic cell death in response to
anticancer agents (28, 40). This process occurs in the absence of
caspase activation and is often accompanied by alterations in the
AKT and JNK signaling pathways (31, 41). Activation of the PI3K/
AKT pathway switches on survival pathways, leading to inhibition
of apoptosis and activation of the autophagy antagonist mTOR
(31). PC3 cells are PTEN-null, resulting in the constitutive
activation of PI3K/AKT pathway (41). In this study, Trp-1 strongly
suppressed AKT phosphorylation and reduced protein levels of
mTOR and S6 ribosomal protein in PC3 cells, an effect that may
promote autophagy of PC3 cells. Recently, caspase-independent
JNK activation has been reported to contribute to autophagic cell
death induced by tumor necrosis factor-a and chemicals (32, 42).
Consistent with this finding, Tpr-1–induced autophagic changes
were associated with JNK phosphorylation. However, the mechanism underlying JNK-mediated autophagic cell death is not yet
known.
Recently, Fister and colleagues (43) showed that GnRH-II
antagonists, similar in structure to Trp-1 (i.e., AG-1, AG-2, and
AG-3), induced human endometrial and ovarian cancer cell death
through an apoptotic process associated with mitochondrial
