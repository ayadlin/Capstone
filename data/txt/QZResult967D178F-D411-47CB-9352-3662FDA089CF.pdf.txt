Abstract

Author Manuscript

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is caused by mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) gene
that encodes a tumor suppressor protein called merlin. NF2 is characterized by formation of
multiple schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Merlin loss of function is associated
with increased activity of Rac and p21-activated kinases (PAK) and deregulation of cytoskeletal
organization. LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and 2) are substrate for Cdc42/Rac-PAK, and
modulate actin dynamics by phosphorylating cofilin at serine-3. This modification inactivates
cofilin’s actin severing and depolymerizing activity. LIMKs also translocate into the nucleus and
regulate cell cycle progression. Significantly, LIMKs are overexpressed in several tumor types,
including skin, breast, lung, liver and prostate. Here we report that mouse Schwann cells (MSCs)
in which merlin function is lost as a result of Nf2 exon2 deletion (Nf2ΔEx2) exhibited increased
levels of LIMK1, LIMK2, and active phospho-Thr508/505-LIMK1/2, as well as phospho-Ser3cofilin, compared to wild-type normal MSCs. Similarly, levels of LIMK1 and 2 total protein and
active phosphorylated forms were elevated in human vestibular schwannomas compared to normal
human Schwann cells (SCs). Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 into Nf2ΔEx2 MSC reduced LIMK1

and LIMK2 levels. We show that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK with BMS-5, decreased the
viability of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect viability of control
MSCs. Similarly, LIMK knockdown decreased viability of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs. The decreased viability
of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs was not due to caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis, but rather, to
inhibition of cell cycle progression as evidenced by accumulation of cells in G2/M phase.
Inhibition of LIMKs arrest cells in early mitosis by decreasing Aurora A activation. Our results
suggest that LIMKs are potential drug targets for NF2 and tumors associated with merlin
deficiency.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF2 cause neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), an
autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of about one in 25,000 individuals (1). The
characteristic feature of NF2 is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas that
typically cause deafness, facial paralysis and disequilibrium following surgical removal to
prevent life-threatening complications. Frequently, NF2 patients also develop multiple
schwannomas in other nerves as well as meningiomas and ependymomas (2). Mutations in
the NF2 gene are also common in malignant mesothelioma (3). Currently, the standard
treatment for NF2 schwannomas is microsurgery or stereotactic radiosurgery. Unfortunately,
limited operability, poor preservation of hearing, diminished functionality of facial nerves
and the small risk of radiation-induced malignant transformation later, compromise good
clinical outcomes. Only a handful of NF2 pre-clinical and clinical trials are ongoing, all of
which utilize existing anti-cancer drugs (4, 5).

Author Manuscript

The NF2 gene encodes a tumor suppressor called merlin or schwannomin. Merlin regulates
a number of processes in Schwann cells (SCs) (6, 7). Normal SCs usually proliferate slowly
and adopt a bipolar morphology, however, merlin-deficient human schwannoma cells
exhibit abnormalities in proliferation, motility and morphology in vitro(8). Merlin’s
mechanism of action remains poorly understood, but appears to involve regulation of surface
receptor activity and turnover by modulation of their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton
and transduction of downstream signals (7). A potential pathway through which merlin
regulates the actin cytoskeleton involves Cdc42/Rac-PAK-LIMK-cofilin (9–11). Loss of
merlin function is associated with elevated levels of active Rac and p21-activated kinase
(PAK), suggesting that merlin is a negative regulator of Rac and PAK-dependent pathways.
Conversely, PAK phosphorylates and inactivates merlin’s tumor suppressor activity (12, 13).
Work from our laboratory has shown that activation of β1-integrin in normal SCs promotes
PAK-dependent phosphorylation of merlin at serine-518 (ref.14). While PAK has been
studied as a potential therapeutic target for NF2, its large number of substrates confounds its
usefulness (15).

The LIM kinase (LIMK) family has two members, LIMK1 and LIMK2, which can be
phosphorylated by Cdc42/Rac-PAK1, 2 and 4 at threonine-505/508 and converted into
active serine/threonine kinases. LIMKs are also regulated by Rho-associated kinases
(ROCK) and the myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase (MRCK). The
major LIMK substrate is the actin depolymerizing and severing protein cofilin/ADF (16).
LIMK-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin at serine-3 inactivates cofilin and promotes
stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton (17). LIMKs also translocate from the cortical
cytoplasm and focal adhesions, where they modulate cell morphology and motility, to the
centrosome and nucleus, where they regulate mitosis and cytokinesis (18–24). LIMKs interact
with Aurora A, a serine/threonine kinase involved in centrosome dynamics, spindle
assembly and chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis (25, 26).

Author Manuscript

Aurora A is found on duplicated centrosomes and mitotic spindle microtubules. During early
mitosis phospho-LIMKs co-localize with γ-tubulin in the centrosomes. In metaphase
LIMK1 is found at the spindle poles and later redistributes to the cleavage furrow. LIMK2 is
located along the spindle and at the cleavage furrow of post-mitotic cells. LIMK1 is a
substrate for, and phosphorylates Aurora A to promote its autophosphorylation at Thr288
(ref.27). LIMK2 is an Aurora A substrate and stabilizes it by kinase and scaffolding
actions (28). LIMKs are overexpressed and implicated in various cancers, such as breast,
lung, skin, liver and prostate, and several tumor cell lines (29–32). Hence, LIMKs are
emerging cancer targets yet, few inhibitors have been identified (33).

Author Manuscript

We show that the levels of total and phosphorylated LIMK and its phosphorylated substrate
are elevated in sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VS) compared to normal human SCs.
Utilizing Nf2ΔEx2 mouse Schwann cells (MSCs) as a cellular model of NF2, we show that
pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing of LIMK significantly reduces proliferation
of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs, but does not substantially affect control Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs. The
decreased proliferation is due to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Pharmacological
inhibition of LIMKs with BMS-5 slows mitotic progression by decreasing phosphorylation
of cofilin and Aurora A. These studies suggest that LIMKs are potential therapeutic targets
for NF2 and other merlin-deficient tumors.

Results
LIMK and phospho-cofilin levels are elevated in Nf2Δ Ex2 MSCs compared to controls

Author Manuscript

Using two complementary techniques, we assessed the levels of LIMK and phospho-Ser3cofilin in Nf2- deficient (Nf2ΔEx2) MSC lines developed by in vitro ad-Cre deletion of Nf2
exon2 from Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs (34). By immunostaining Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs were confirmed to
be merlin-deficient and expressed the SC marker S100 (Figure 1a). Merlin-deficient
Schwann cells were larger than control Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs and had increased levels of Factin revealed by phalloidin staining. The intensity of LIMK1 and LIMK2
immunofluorescence was higher in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs than in controls and was detected
throughout the cell. Consistent with increased LIMK activity, the intensity of phospho-Ser3cofilin immunofluorescence was also higher in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs than in controls (Figure 1 a,
b).

We also assessed merlin expression in control Nf2flox2/flox2 and Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs by western
blotting using an N-terminal merlin antibody. Merlin was detected in Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs but
not in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs (Figure 1 c). The status of the Nf2 gene was also confirmed by PCR
analysis of DNA and revealed deletion of exon 2 in Nf2ΔEx2 as evidenced by a 338-bp band
(Figure 1 d) (34).
In addition, western blotting confirmed that levels of both LIMK1 and LIMK2 protein were
higher in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs than in Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs (Figure 1 e). We detected a coordinate
increase in the level of phospho-Ser3-cofilin in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs with respect to control
consistent with high levels of LIMK activity (Figure 1 f).
Reintroduction of wild-type NF2 normalizes LIMK protein levels

Author Manuscript

To assess whether elevated LIMK levels were linked to merlin inactivation, we reintroduced
a halo-tagged wild-type human NF2 into Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs by nucleofection. This method
yielded ~10% transfection rate, determined by halo-tag fluorescence labeling. Re-expression
of merlin in cultured Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs generally decreased LIMK1, LIMK2 and phosphoSer3-cofilin levels (Figure 2 a, b). This result supports a relationship between merlin
inactivation and increased LIMK expression and activity.
Pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1/2 by BMS-5 or genetic silencing of LIMK1/2 reduces
Nf2ΔEx2 MSC viability

Author Manuscript

We next sought to determine whether LIMK was a potential drug target for NF2. We tested
the efficacy of BMS-5, a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of LIMK1/2, on reducing
phosphorylation of cofilin on Ser3 (ref. 35). BMS-5 inhibited cofilin-Ser3 phosphorylation
in a dose-dependent manner in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs with an IC50 of ~ 2 µM (Figure 3 a, b). We
next tested the ability of BMS-5 to reduce viability of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs. The 100% viability
control was 0.1% DMSO and a positive cell death control was obtained with 50 µM
rapamycin (RM) that caused approximately 80% cell death in 24 hours. BMS-5 reduced
Nf2ΔEx2 MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 3.9 µM (Figure 3 c), but
did not significantly reduce the viability of control Nf2flox2/flox2 MSCs at equivalent BMS-5
concentrations (Figure 3 d). At 10µM BMS-5, Nf2∆Ex2 MSC viability was 40% compared to
83% for controls.

Author Manuscript

To confirm the validity of LIMK as a drug target, we knocked down LIMK1 and LIMK2 in
Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs using lentiviral shRNA transduction (Supplementary Figure S1). Consistent
with the BMS-5 results, LIMK1 and LIMK2 knockdown reduced viability of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs
compared to scrambled shRNA controls in a 24 hour assay (Figure 3 e). These results
suggest that LIMK inhibition or silencing in merlin-deficient cells reduces their viability
either by promoting cell death or hindering proliferation.
Decreased viability of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs in response to BMS-5 or LIMK silencing is
independent of apoptosis
To determine if BMS-5 promoted Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs apoptosis, we measured caspase 3/7
activity. We found that BMS-5 did not activate caspase3/7, whereas the positive control,
staurosporine, promoted dose-dependent activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure 5 a). To determine

if BMS-5 promoted caspase-independent apoptosis, we analyzed BMS-5-treated Nf2ΔEx2
MSCs by flow cytometry using a ratiometric membrane asymmetry probe that detects loss
of membrane phospholipid asymmetry associated with apoptosis. We observed only a small
increase (3.5%) of apoptotic cells after 7 hours of BMS-5 treatment (Figure 4 b). Consistent
with pharmacological LIMK inhibition, knockdown of LIMK1 or LIMK2 was not
associated with caspase 3/7 activity increase compared to scrambled shRNA controls
examined 24 hours after plating (Figure 4 c). Similarly, caspase-independent apoptosis was
not observed in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs transduced with either LIMK1 or LIMK2 shRNA (Figure 4
d). These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of LIMK
affect Nf2ΔEx2 MSC viability through an apoptosis-independent mechanism.
Pharmacological inhibition of LIMK1/2 by BMS-5 reduces DNA synthesis and cell-cycle
progression

Author Manuscript

We next assessed the ability of BMS-5 to interfere with proliferation of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs. The
cells were incubated with 1 and 2 µM BMS-5 for 24, 48 and 72 hours and cell numbers were
measured using crystal violet staining. We observed fewer BMS-5 treated Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs
than DMSO-treated controls (Figure 5 a). In addition, we found that BMS-5 decreased DNA
synthesis in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5 b).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To test the possibility that the decrease in proliferation was a consequence of cell-cycle
inhibition, we performed flow cytometry analysis of cells stained with propidium iodine
(PI). BMS-5 interfered with Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs cell-cycle progression as evidenced by an
increase in the percentage of diploid cells trapped in the G2/M phase (Figure 6 a). We
further analyzed the distribution of cells among the cell-cycle phases using a BrdU/7AAD
assay. There was a significant increase in the number of cells accumulating in the G2/M
phase in samples treated with 5 µM BMS-5 as compared to vehicle control (20% vs. 42%).
This was accompanied by a decrease in the number of BMS-5 treated cells in G1 as
compared to control (41% vs. 26%). This is consistent with the results obtained by analysis
of PI staining (Figure 6 b–c). Overlay of the 7AAD-area histograms clearly demonstrated a
significant increase in the G2/M population in BMS-5 compared to DMSO treated cells
(Figure 6 d). Furthermore, the increase in the G2/M population was accompanied by an
increase in the number of cells with higher DNA content consistent with a polyploidy or
multinucleated cell population. There was also a smaller but substantial change in number of
cells detected in the S-phase of cell cycle in samples treated with BMS-5 as compared to
DMSO control. Lastly, the population of cells in the S phase decreased with increasing
BMS-5 concentration (Supplementary Figure S2). These results taken together suggest that
inhibition of LIMK activity in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs interferes with progression of the G2/M phase
of the cell cycle, thereby decreasing the number of viable Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs.
BMS-5 inhibition of LIMK1/2 activity decreases Aurora A phosphorylation and causes
formation of abnormal mitotic spindles
To identify additional down-stream effects of BMS-5 (beyond inhibition of cofilin-Ser3
phosphorylation) that could cause a G2/M arrest, we tested the levels of Aurora A
phosphorylation. Aurora A interacts with both LIMK1 and 2 and is a major regulator of
mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal alignment and segregation. We found that

Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs treated with increasing concentrations of BMS-5 had a dose dependent
decrease phosphorylation of Aurora A at Thr288 (Figure 7 a, b).

Author Manuscript

We next studied the effect of BMS-5 on the spindle assembly visualizing the mitotic nuclei
and spindle machinery by immunostaining. We found that Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs had normal
spindle assembly and BMS-5 treated Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs showed abnormal spindle structure
(Figure 8 a). Analyzing the centrosome positioning by immunostaining for centrin-1, we
found that BMS-5 treated cells were not able to organize the centrosomes and generally had
more than two with different sizes (Figure 8 b). We conducted cell cycle analysis and found
that the percentage of cells in late G2/M, visualized by positive immunostaining for the
mitotic marker phospho-Ser10-histone3 (pH3), significantly increased from 5% to 17% in
the BMS-5 treated Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs compared to DMSO controls (Figure 8 c, d). We observed
a highly significant decrease in the percentage BMS-5 treated Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs that advanced
to late mitotic phases (anaphase/telophase). Moreover, BMS-5 treated Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs had
abnormal spindles and chromosomes did not align at the center as occurs in metaphase
(Figure 8 a–e). These results suggest that LIMK inhibition exerts its anti-proliferative effect
not only by altering organization of the actin cytoskeleton through inhibition of cofilin
phosphorylation but also by decreasing LIMK dependent activation of Aurora A.
LIMKs levels are elevated in representative samples of human vestibular Schwannoma
compared to human SCs

Author Manuscript

To examine the relevance of LIMK inhibition to NF2, we compared LIMK1 and LIMK2
protein and phosphorylation levels in a small number of samples of HSCs from normal
individuals and sporadic human vestibular schwannomas (VSs). We observed a significant
increase (P<0.05 determined using unpaired t- test of HSC vs. VS populations, two-tailed)
in both the protein and phospho-Thre508 levels of LIMK1 in VSs compared to HSCs
(Figure 9a, b). Similarly, both LIMK2 and phospho-Thr505-LIMK2 levels showed a
tendency to be higher in VSs compared to HSCs (Figure 9 c, d). Interestingly, the proportion
of phospho-Ser3-cofilin to the total cofilin was higher in VSs than in HSCs (Figure 9 e).
We also measured LIMK protein and phosphorylation levels in a human schwannoma cell
line, HEI-193, developed from a NF2 patient by immortalization with HPV E6-E7 genes(36).
Although the phospho-Thr508/Thr505 LIMK1/2 antibody recognized multiple bands, the
relative intensities of the most prominent phospho-LIMK 1/2 (Thr508/Thr505) bands were
also higher in HEI-193 cells than in control HSCs (Figure 9 f).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

LIMK expression and activity are elevated in merlin-deficient SCs compared to normal SCs
Here we document an association between loss of merlin function and increased levels of
LIMK1 and LIMK2 expression and activity. The increased LIMK activity in Nf2-deficient
MSCs is consistent with its activation by Cdc42/Rac-PAK1, 2 and 4 (ref.16), which have
been well-documented to be increased in schwannomas (12, 15). Importantly, reintroduction
of merlin into Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs reduced LIMK and phospho-Ser3-cofilin levels, further
supporting an association between loss of merlin function and inactivation of cofilin’s actin-

severing and depolymerizing activity downstream of activation of the Rac/PAK/LIMK
pathway. In agreement with previous studies of human schwannoma cells, we found that
Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs exhibited an abnormal actin cytoskeleton compared to control MSCs (8).
Interestingly, similar cytoskeleton characteristics, indicative of F-actin stabilization, have
been reported in C2C12 and HeLa cells overexpressing LIMK (17, 37). We propose that
phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin downstream of elevated Rac/PAK/LIMK activity
could account for the reported increased cell size and abundance of actin filaments observed
in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs and human schwannoma cells (38).
Inhibition of LIMK activities causes cell-cycle arrest of Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs by preventing Aurora
A activation

Author Manuscript

We recently demonstrated using BMS-5 that LIMK-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin is
necessary for stable alignment of SC processes along sensory neuron axons in culture(39).
Here we showed that BMS-5 decreased Nf2-deficient MSCs viability in a dose-dependent
manner while having little effect on controls. These results suggest a potential therapeutic
window for treatment of schwannomas with LIMK inhibitors. Studies using shRNA
knockdown of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs confirmed the specificity of BMS-5 on
LIMK activity. Intriguingly, during LIMK silencing in Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs, we found that these
cells did not sustain long-term LIMK knockdown and were able to restore their original
expression levels. Thus, we only used cells within their first two passages after puromycin
selection. We speculate that Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs silence LIMK shRNA by a methylationdependent mechanism as shown for PAK shRNAs in schwannoma cells (15).

Author Manuscript

Inhibition of LIMK activity with BMS-5 reduced Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs viability by causing their
arrest at the M phase of the cell cycle. Others have shown that LIMK’s localization and
activity changes during the cell cycle and that cofilin phosphorylation dynamics are
necessary for successful cytokinesis (21, 23, 24). Importantly, LIMK1 knockdown in HeLa
cells or treatment with a LIMK inhibitor peptide resulted in delayed mitotic progression and
irregular spindle orientation (22). These reports support our conclusion that inhibition of
LIMK activity with BMS-5 arrested Nf2-deficient cells in the M phase thereby decreasing
the number of cells in S phase, and increasing the number of polyploid cells.

Author Manuscript

The reported interaction and functional cooperation of LIMK1 and 2 with Aurora A led us to
explore the effect of LIMK inhibition with BMS-5 on Aurora A autophosphorylation(25). In
agreement with the observations made with LIMK1 knockdown in PC-3 cells, we found that
BMS-5 reduced Aurora A phosphorylation at Thr288 (ref. 27). It is important to note that
BMS-5 does not directly inhibit Aurora A kinase activity, because BMS-5 (compound 3 in
ref. 35) was tested in vitro against a panel of kinases and Aurora A retained 100% activity
when tested with 10 µM BMS-5 (ref. 35). Interestingly, the abnormal spindle and
centrosome organization observed here resembles the abnormal metaphase spindles with
multipolar and/or wheel-barrel shape and non-assembled chromosomes observed in a
LIMK2 knockdown in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells (24). The integrity of the mitotic spindle
is required for progression from metaphase to anaphase, and any abnormality in the spindle
assembly checkpoint delays or hinders the onset of anaphase. Hence, inhibition of LIMKs

activity by BMS-5 leads to inhibition of Aurora A kinase activity, and thus provides a
molecular pathway for the G2/M block of merlin deficient SCs treated with BMS-5.
Recently, LIMK has been show to promote tumor neovascularization through the
VEGF/p38/MK2/LIMK1/annexin1 pathway (40). This finding may potentially connect
LIMK inhibition with the observed reduction in angiogenesis in vivo following treatment
with Bevacizumab, which reduces tumor volumes and, in some patients, restores some
hearing (4). Thus, we speculate that inhibition of LIMK might halt tumor progression not
only by interfering with cell-cycle progression in schwannoma cells, but also by inhibiting
angiogenesis.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, our studies suggest a potential therapeutic target for NF2, the LIMKs, which
are recognized substrates of Cdc42/Rac-PAK1,2,4. We show enhanced LIMK expression
and activity in merlin-deficient MSCs and as well as VS as opposed to controls. Reduction
in LIMK activity or protein levels decreases Nf2-deficient MSC viability by arresting cells
in the prometaphase stage of the cell-cycle in association with decreased activation of
Aurora A necessary for centrosome and mitotic spindle organization. Future studies
addressing whether LIMK inhibition is an effective treatment for schwannomas in mouse
models of NF2 are warranted.

LIMK1 and LIMK2 knockdown in Nf2ΔEx2MSCs

Author Manuscript

Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs were plated onto PLL-coated (200 µg/ml) 6-well dishes, cultured at 37°C,
7% CO2, in medium containing DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA) plus N2 supplement (Invitrogen: Burlington, ONT, Canada) and 1% Penicillin/
Streptomycin. When cultures reached 40% confluence, lentiviral transduction particles were
added at 5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) in growth medium plus 8 µg/ml hexadimethrine
bromide (Sigma). MISSION shRNA lentiviral particles for mouse gene silencing were from
Sigma-Aldrich. LIMK1 clone IDs: NM_010717.1-1546s1c1 (named construct #44);
NM_010717.1-1414s1c1 (#47) and LIMK2 clone IDs: NM_010718.1-1409s1c1 (#73);
NM_010718.3-827s21c1 (#95). Negative control was pLKO.1-puro non-mammalian
shRNA (SHC002V). Optimum MOI determined empirically with pLKO.1-puro-CMVTurboGFP transduction lentiviral particles (SHC003V) titer. After 18–20 hours, infection
medium was replaced with fresh medium for 24 hours and subsequently replaced with
growth medium containing 1µg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to select transduced cells.
The puromycin concentration was determined performing a toxicity curve.
Reintroduction of NF2 into Nf2ΔEx2MSCs

Author Manuscript

To reintroduce merlin into Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs, 1.5–2 million cells were resuspended in 100 µl of
basic Nucleofector solution for mammalian glial cells with supplements (Lonza, Cologne,
Germany) plus 1 µg of pFC15K HaloTagCMVd1-NF2 using an Amaxa Nucleofector II
device and Program A-033. 1 ml of warm growth medium was added and 50 µl of cell
suspension was seeded on coated 11mm round German glass coverslips (Carolina Biol.,
Burlington, NC, USA) containing 100 µl of equilibrated growth medium and incubated 40
hours at 37°C, 7% CO2 before analysis.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated on coated German glass coverslips and immunostained as previously
described (41). Labeling of Halo-Tag-NF2-transfected cells was done in vivo with HaloTag®
TMR Ligand (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following manufacturer’s rapid labeling
protocol. Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM710 microscope with 3 spectral
detection channels, 5 laser lines - 458, 488, 514,543 & 633 nm, FL filter set 49 DAPI, EX
G365 shift free, FL filter set 43 CY 3 shift free, FL filter set 38 Endow GFP, shift free, PlanApochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 and EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.3 DIC WD=0.21 M27
objective lenses on an AxioObserver Z1 Stand and ZEN2009 software. Fluorescence was
collected from a single plane on separate channels maintaining the same acquisition
parameters for each labeled protein. Images from each experiment were processed
identically with ZEN2011 software. For spindle images, Z-stacks were collected with the
63xOil objective and 3.5 zoom factor. 2-D images were obtained by median filter and
maximum intensity projection with ZEN2011.

Membrane asymmetry assay
Cell membrane asymmetry was measured with the Violet Ratiometric Membrane
Asymmetry Probe/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Cells were
seeded in 200 µg/ml PLL-coated 6-well plates and incubated with BMS-5/vehicle for 24 hrs.
Cell were harvested and assayed following manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were
analyzed on a BD Canto-II (Becton, Dickinson and Co, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) flow
cytometer setting excitation and collection emission wavelength recommended by the
manufacturer. The ratio parameter was established using BD FACSDiva™ 6.1.3 software as
recommended by the manufacturer.
Proliferation assays

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation was studied with two different techniques. Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs seeded in a 24well format, had cell numbers assessed with the Crystal Violet Assay as previously
described (42). Absorbance at 595 nm was measured with a µQuant plate reader (BioTek).
Rate of DNA synthesis was evaluated at 24 hrs with the Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay
(Invitrogen/ Life Technologies). The assay was carried out in 96- and 384-well plate formats
following manufacturer’s instructions without the Amplex® UltraRed amplification steps.
DAPI stain was included in the wash after the reaction cocktail incubation step. Oregon
green-488 and DAPI fluorescence was quantified by a plate reader.
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodine (PI) staining and
BrdU/7AAD. 106 ethanol fixed cells were PI stained using 500 µl PI/RNase staining buffer
(Beckton-Dickinson). Samples were examined on a BD Canto-II flow cytometer and
histograms were analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham,
ME, USA). For each sample, 10 000 events were collected.
The BrdU/7AAD assay kit was from Beckton-Dickinson. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and treated with inhibitor/vehicle overnight. Next day, cultures were incubated with 10 µM
BrdU for 3 hrs, and the assay performed according to manufacturer’s instruction. Samples
were analyzed with a BD Canto-II flow cytometer using the BD FACSDiva™ 6.1.3

BMS-5 decreases Nf2ΔEx2 MSC proliferation and DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent
manner. (a) Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs were grown in 24-well plates. Cell proliferation was measured at
0; 24; 48 and 72 hrs time points after incubation with BMS-5 or DMSO vehicle. The number
of cells at each time point was assessed with the crystal violet assay. Graph combines 3
independent experiments in triplicates (mean ± SEM, n=9). (b) Nf2ΔEx2 MSCs were treated
with the indicated BMS-5 concentrations for 24 hrs. EdU was added to the culture for the
last 6 hours. Incorporation of EdU into S-phase cells was assessed with the EdU Click-It
microplate assay and fluorescence was measured on a plate reader. Graph combines 3
independent experiments (mean ± SEM, n=44).
