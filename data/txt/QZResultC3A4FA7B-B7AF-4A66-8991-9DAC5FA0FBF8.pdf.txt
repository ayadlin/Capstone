Abstract
MYCN amplification occurs in ∼25% of neuroblastomas, where it is associated with rapid tumor progression
and poor prognosis. MYCN plays a paradoxical role in driving cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis.
Based on observations of nuclear p53 accumulation in neuroblastoma, we hypothesized that MYCN may
regulate p53 in this setting. Immunohistochemical analysis of 82 neuroblastoma tumors showed an association of high p53 expression with MYCN expression and amplification. In a panel of 5 MYCN-amplified and 5
nonamplified neuroblastoma cell lines, and also in the Tet21N-regulatable MYCN expression system, we further documented a correlation between the expression of MYCN and p53. In MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
cell lines, MYCN knockdown decreased p53 expression. In Tet21N MYCN+ cells, higher levels of p53 transcription, mRNA, and protein were observed relative to Tet21N MYCN- cells. In chromatin immunoprecipitation
and reporter gene assays, MYCN bound directly to a Myc E-Box DNA binding motif located close to the transcriptional start site within the p53 promoter, where it could initiate transcription. E-Box mutation decreased
MYCN-driven transcriptional activation. Microarray analysis of Tet21N MYCN+/− cells identified several p53regulated genes that were upregulated in the presence of MYCN, including MDM2 and PUMA, the levels of
which were reduced by MYCN knockdown. We concluded that MYCN transcriptionally upregulates p53 in
neuroblastoma and uses p53 to mediate a key mechanism of apoptosis. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1377–88. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal malignancy derived from
precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Despite
significant advances in understanding the biology of this
tumor, it currently still remains one of the most difficult
childhood cancers to cure, with <40% of patients with high
risk disease (stage 4 disease over 18 months of age or MYCNamplified disease) being long-term survivors (1, 2).
Amplification of MYCN occurs in ∼25% of neuroblastomas,
and is associated with rapid tumor progression and poor
prognosis (reviewed in ref. 3). MYCN belongs to the Myc
family of basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription
factors that have a critical role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis. Members of this

family function as heterodimers with Max, and exert transcriptional activity by specifically binding to consensus
E-Box motifs (CA(C/T)GTG) located within the promoter
regions of a diverse set of target genes (reviewed in ref. 4).
In contrast to c-MYC, which is expressed in a wide variety
of embryonic and adult tissues, MYCN expression is limited to the developing nervous system and selected
other sites.
Several genes have been identified as c-MYC transcriptional targets (5),4 however, less is known about target genes of
MYCN. Early studies found that several c-MYC target genes
were expressed in some neuroblastoma cell lines with MYCN
amplification, but not all, suggesting that other cell-specific
factors may be important (6). Recent studies have reported
significant overlap between c-MYC and MYCN-regulated
gene sets (7, 8). Enhanced ectopic expression of MYCN leads
to both accelerated cell cycle progression and sensitization
to apoptosis, therefore, mechanisms which minimize or
evade MYCN-driven apoptosis are essential for tumor progression in neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification (reviewed in ref. 9).
p53, often referred to as the “guardian of the genome”, is
mutated in up to 60% of many human malignancies. In neuroblastoma, p53 is rarely mutated, however, protein accumulation is frequently observed in both neuroblastoma tumors

and cell lines (reviewed in ref. 10). The presence of accumulated p53 in neuroblastoma has been suggested to be due to
the embryonic nature of these tumors, reflecting a failure of
the precursor cells to mature (11). We and others have shown
that the accumulated p53 is both predominantly nuclear and

functional in neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines (reviewed
in ref. 12).
Early studies using reporter gene assays and electrophoretic gel mobility analysis reported that p53 was a direct target gene of c-MYC (13, 14). Furthermore, it was shown using

quiescent fibroblasts that p53 directly mediates c-MYC–
induced apoptosis, and suggests that c-MYC–driven p53mediated apoptosis acts as a safeguard mechanism against
aberrant oncogenic activation (15). The p53 promoter contains a noncanonical E-Box (CATGTG) located upstream of
the transcription initiation site (13, 14) and is recognized by
MYC-MAX heterodimers (16), which can bind and initiate
transcription (14). Several studies have reported a positive
correlation between c-MYC expression and p53 expression
in both cell lines and tumors, and that inhibition of c-MYC
expression using either antisense RNA or inhibitory peptides
led to a decrease in p53 expression (reviewed in ref. 17).
This study set out to test the hypothesis that p53 accumulation in neuroblastoma correlates with MYCN amplification
status and MYCN expression, and that p53 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN.

Materials and Methods
Immunohistochemistry of neuroblastoma tumors.
Eighty-two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diagnostic,
untreated neuroblastoma tumors were examined for p53
and MYCN by immunohistochemistry using antibodies and
methods previously reported (12). MYCN hybridoma supernatant MYCN (NCMIX102) was used at a 1:4 dilution. Positive tissue controls included colonic adenocarcinoma for
p53 and MYCN-amplified NGP neuroblastoma cell cytoblocks
for MYCN. Negative controls included incubations without
primary antibodies and surrounding nontumor tissue. The
p53 and MYCN labeling indices were performed as previously
described (12). MYCN amplification was performed routinely
on 40 frozen tumors, which were diagnosed after 1990,
using Southern blot hybridization and fluorescent in situ
hybridization.
Cell lines. p53 wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines (18, 19)
used were MYCN-amplified (IMR32, NBLW, CHLA136, LAN5,
SMSKCNR, and NGP), non–MYCN-amplified (SHSY5Y, NB69,

SKNRA, and SHEP), non–MYCN-amplified high MYCN expressing (SJNB1 and NBLS), and the conditional MYCNexpressing SHEP Tet21N system together with p53-null osteosarcoma SAOS2 and p53 mutant neuroblastoma SKNBE2C
cells (20). Cells were cultured as previously described (21). To
switch off MYCN expression, Tet21N cells were cultured in
the presence of 1 μg/mL of tetracycline (Sigma) for 48 h. Cell
lines were obtained from the Children's Oncology Group Cell
Culture and Xenograft Repository (LAN5), Sue Cohn (NBLW
and NBLS), Linda Harris (SJNB1), Penny Lovat (SHSY5Y,
SHEP, and IMR32), John Maris (NB69), Patrick Reynolds
(SKNRA, SMSKCNR, and CHLA136), Barbara Spengler
(SKNBE2C), Manfred Schwab (SHEPTet21N), Rogier Versteeg
(NGP), and Ximena Montano (SAOS2) between 1996 and
2007, and were validated upon receipt using cytogenetic
analysis courtesy of Nick Bown, Institute of Human Genetics,
Newcastle University, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon
Tyne, United Kingdom.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed as previously described (21). All primers and probes were inventoried
TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). RNA
expression values were normalized to actin. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.
Western analysis. Western blotting was performed using
previously described methods (20). Primary antibodies used
were p53 DO-7 (Novocastra Laboratories, Ltd.) at 1:1,000,

MYCN expression using siRNA (50 nmol/L; M) in two MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, SMSKCNR and LAN5, compared with scrambled siRNA

Actinomycin D and cycloheximide treatment. Tet21N
MYCN+ and MYCN− cells were treated with either 1 μg/mL
of actinomycin D (Sigma), or 25 μmol/L of cycloheximide
(Calbiochem). Cells were harvested at the indicated times after actinomycin D treatment for qRT-PCR analysis of mRNA
expression, and after cycloheximide treatment for protein

Statistical analyses. Statistical tests were performed using
Minitab (Minitab, Inc.) or GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All statistical tests were two-sided. If the expected
frequency of a χ2 test was <5, Fisher's exact test was performed using GraphPad Prism.

Results
p53 protein expression is associated with MYCN amplification and expression in neuroblastoma tumors. p53 expression, localization, and relationship with histology in this
set of neuroblastoma tumors has been previously reported
(12). p53 was found to be predominantly nuclear and expressed at high levels in undifferentiated and poorly differentiated neuroblastoma (Fig. 1A; ref. 12). MYCN expression was
nuclear, heterogeneous, and expressed at higher levels in undifferentiated, poorly differentiated, and International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification unfavorable histology
tumors (Fig. 1A; data not shown). MYCN was not expressed
in Schwannian stroma (Fig. 1A). MYCN expression was significantly higher in MYCN-amplified tumors as expected
and only three non–MYCN-amplified tumors expressed
MYCN detectable by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A and B;
Table 1). Using the median labeling index for p53 and MYCN
in all 82 tumors as a cutoff between positive and negative
expression, increased p53 expression was significantly associated with MYCN amplification with two of the p53 antibodies used (Table 1; Fig. 1A and C), and with MYCN expression
with all three p53 antibodies (Table 1; Fig. 1A and D). For
p53DO-7, the median difference in labeling index between
MYCN-amplified and nonamplified neuroblastoma was
8.6%, median p53DO-7 labeling indices were 6.7% for non–
MYCN-amplified tumors and 13.5% for MYCN-amplified tumors (Fig. 1C).
p53 protein expression correlates with MYCN expression
in neuroblastoma cell lines. p53 protein levels were analyzed in a panel of 10 p53 wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines,
conditional MYCN expressing SHEP Tet21N cells, and two
negative control cell lines, p53 mutant SKNBE2C and p53

null SAOS2 cells (Fig. 2A). Induced levels of MYCN in Tet21N
MYCN+ cells were comparable with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). p53 expression was found to
correlate with MYCN expression (P < 0.005, r = 0.7924, Spearman correlation; Fig. 2A and B), but not with MYCN amplification (data not shown).
To further investigate p53 expression in relation to MYCN
expression, MYCN expression was inhibited using siRNA in
p53 wild-type MYCN-amplified SMSKCNR and LAN5 cells.
This led to decreased p53 protein (Fig. 2C) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2D) in both cell lines. At 24 hours after MYCN
knockdown, LAN5 cells exhibited a ∼40% reduction in p53
mRNA expression (Fig. 2D) and a ∼50% reduction in p53 protein expression (P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 2C), whereas the
SMSKCNR cell line exhibited a ∼30% (Fig. 2D) and ∼40%
(Fig. 2C) reduction in p53 mRNA and protein expression,
respectively.
p53 expression, transcriptional activity, and induction
of p53-regulated genes in SHEP Tet21N cells. Tet21N
MYCN+ cells were found to express significantly higher p53
mRNA (P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 3A) and protein (P < 0.05,
paired t test; Figs. 2A and 3A) compared with Tet21N MYCN−
cells. Consistent with higher p53 transcript and protein levels, Tet21N MYCN+ cells exhibited significantly greater
p53 DNA-binding capacity (P < 0.005, paired t test) and transcriptional activity (P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 3B) in comparison with Tet21N MYCN− cells. Furthermore, higher mRNA
(P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 3C) and protein (P < 0.05, paired
t test; Fig. 3D) expression of two endogenous p53 target
genes, MDM2 and PUMA, were observed in Tet21N MYCN+
cells compared with Tet21N MYCN− cells, confirming the results of the reporter gene and DNA binding assays, indicating
that the accumulated p53 in Tet21N MYCN+ cells is transcriptionally active.
Modulation of MYCN expression in Tet21N cells by continuous culture in the presence of tetracycline for 2 weeks, followed by the removal of tetracycline from the growth
medium, resulted in the induction of MYCN expression and
showed that p53 mRNA (data not shown) and protein expression positively correlated with MYCN protein expression (P <
0.005, r = 0.8667, Spearman correlation; Fig. 4A), lending further support for MYCN regulation of p53 in this system.
To determine whether p53 is functional after DNA damage
in Tet21N MYCN+/− cells, cells were subjected to 4 Gy of
X-irradiation and analyzed for the expression of p21WAF1
and MDM2. Following DNA damage, there was an increase
in Ser15 phosphorylated p53 as well as induction of p53,

p21WAF1, and MDM2 in Tet21N MYCN+ and MYCN− cells
(Fig. 4B). The basal and induced levels of p53, phosphorylated
p53 at Ser15, MDM2, and p21WAF1 were all higher in Tet21N
MYCN+ cells compared with Tet21N MYCN− cells (Fig. 4B),
consistent with higher levels of p53 activity in the presence of
MYCN. The above data confirms that p53 is functional both
in the presence and absence of MYCN in this system.
To determine whether the greater induction of p21WAF1
and MDM2 in Tet21N MYCN+ cells is dependent on functional p53, p53 was knocked down using siRNA and the cells
treated with 4 Gy of X-irradiation prior to analysis of p21WAF1
and MDM2 expression. Inhibition of p53 using siRNA led to
complete abrogation of p21WAF1 and MDM2 induction following DNA damage, further confirming that p53 is functional and that induction of p21WAF1 and MDM2 is dependent on
functional p53 (data not shown). In addition, following
knockdown of p53, basal levels of MDM2 and p21WAF1 were
much lower than in the cells treated with scrambled (SCR)
control siRNA (data not shown).
Gene expression microarray analysis of p53 and p53regulated gene expression in the presence of ectopic
MYCN. Affymetrix gene expression microarray analysis of
SHEP Tet21N MYCN+ and MYCN− cells was performed to
determine whether there was upregulation of p53 and/or
p53-regulated genes in the presence of MYCN. qRT-PCR
was performed on selected genes to validate microarray results (data not shown), and the results were consistent. Several previously reported putative MYCN target genes were
found to be differentially expressed in the presence of MYCN
(Supplementary Table S2). In agreement with qRT-PCR analysis, p53 transcript expression detected by microarray analysis was upregulated 1.9-fold in the presence of MYCN
(Supplementary Table S3). In addition, many p53-regulated
genes were also found to be differentially upregulated in
the presence of MYCN (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To confirm that the increased expression of
p53-regulatable genes in the presence of MYCN was p53dependent, p53 expression in the Tet21N MYCN+ cells was
inhibited using siRNA, and selected p53-regulated genes
analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4C). All genes tested showed a decrease in transcript expression in the presence of p53 siRNA
compared with SCR control, confirming that the observed
increase in expression of p53-regulatable genes is at least
in part dependent on higher levels of p53 present in Tet21N
MYCN+ cells (Fig. 4C).
Irradiation-induced apoptosis in MYCN-amplified cells
is dependent on p53. To determine whether higher levels of
apoptosis in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells is depen-

dent on higher levels of p53 in the presence of MYCN,
MYCN-amplified NGP cells were treated with MYCN and/or
p53 siRNA or SCR siRNA prior to irradiation-induced DNA
damage (Fig. 4D). NGP cells were chosen because we have previously reported high levels of apoptosis following irradiation
in this cell line (20). Apoptosis was determined by analysis
of expression of apoptosis mediator PUMA and cleavage of
caspase-3 together with quantification of caspase-3/7 activity.
Twenty-four hours after irradiation, inhibition of MYCN or
p53 led to decreased caspase-3/7 activity, compared with
cells treated with SCR siRNA (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, inhibition
of MYCN and p53 led to a slightly greater reduction in caspase3/7 activity than inhibition of MYCN or p53 alone (Fig. 4D).
Similarly, inhibition of MYCN and p53 led to a greater reduction in cleavage of caspase-3 and less induced PUMA than inhibition of MYCN or p53 alone (Fig. 4D).
p53 regulation is predominantly at the level of transcription. To determine whether the increased p53 expression in the presence of MYCN is due to transcriptional
regulation or protein stabilization through posttranslational
modifications, Tet21N cells were treated with either 1 μg/mL
of actinomycin D or 25 μmol/L of cycloheximide. Actinomycin D (Fig. 5A) and cycloheximide (Fig. 5B) treatment led to
decreases in p53 mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in
both Tet21N MYCN+ and MYCN− cells. p53 was found to
have a half-life of 30 to 40 minutes in this system. MYCN
levels also decreased following cycloheximide treatment
(Fig. 5B). The above data suggests that the increased expression of p53 in the presence of MYCN is predominantly via
transcriptional regulation rather than p53 stabilization by
posttranslational modifications.
p53 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN. MYCN
ChIP was performed in two MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
cell lines and the Tet21N system to determine whether
MYCN can directly bind to an E-Box motif within the p53
promoter in vivo. It was found that MYCN binds directly to
the noncanonical E-Box motif located close to the transcriptional start site of p53 in Tet21N MYCN+ cells (Fig. 5C) and
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines LAN5 (Fig. 5C) and
SKNBE2C (Supplementary Fig. S2). As expected, no MYCN
binding was observed in Tet21N MYCN− cells (Fig. 5C).
MYCN binding to the E-Box within the nucleolin promoter
in Tet21N MYCN+ cells was used as a positive control
(Fig. 5C).
To confirm the functional regulation of p53 by MYCN, p53
reporter constructs incorporating the wild-type E-Box motif,
CATGTG (pGL2-200 bp and pGL2-356 bp), or the mutated
E-Box motif, CTGCAG (pGL2-Δ200 bp and pGL2-Δ356 bp)

Figure 5. MYCN predominantly regulates p53 at the transcriptional level via direct binding to the E-Box motif within the p53 promoter. A, qRT-PCR
analysis of p53 mRNA expression in Tet21N MYCN+ and MYCN− cells after treatment with 1 μg/mL of actinomycin D shows a decrease in p53 mRNA
expression, suggesting that MYCN regulates p53 transcription. B, Western blot showing p53 and MYCN protein expression in Tet21N MYCN+ (top)
and MYCN− cells (bottom) harvested after treatment with 25 μmol/L of cycloheximide (CHX) shows a decrease in p53 expression suggesting that p53 is not

were transfected into Tet21N MYCN+ and Tet21N MYCN−
cells, and also cotransfected with the pCMV14-MYCN expression plasmid into parental SHEP cells. In line with the above
ChIP data, p53 promoter constructs incorporating the wildtype E-Box motif exhibited significantly greater luciferase activity in the presence of MYCN (P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 5D)
in Tet21N cells as well as in SHEP cells cotransfected with
pCMV14-MYCN (P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 5D). Mutation
of the E-Box motif led to significantly reduced luciferase activity (P < 0.05, paired t test) in Tet21N MYCN+ cells (Fig. 5D)
as well as in SHEP cells cotransfected with pCMV14-MYCN
(P < 0.05, paired t test; Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Like c-MYC, MYCN plays a paradoxical role in driving both
cellular proliferation (27) and inducing apoptosis (28–30).
This is observed histologically by a high mitosis-karyorrhexis
index in both human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors (31–34) and MYCN transgenic mouse neuroblastoma
tumors (35). In addition, in transgenic mouse tumors, we
reported tingible body macrophages reflecting high levels
of apoptosis within these tumors (35). Studies using MYCNamplified cell lines, MYCN transgenic mouse tumors and
ectopic MYCN expressing Tet21N cells have shown higher
p53 levels in the presence of MYCN (21, 36, 37) and increased
levels of apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents
(28, 38–40), and irradiation (21).
We and others have previously observed wild-type nuclear
functional p53 accumulation in neuroblastoma cell lines (reviewed in ref. 10) and tumors (12). p53 has been shown to be
a direct target gene of c-MYC, in which the p53 promoter has
been reported to contain an E-Box–related sequence
(CATGTG) through which the Myc gene family exert transcriptional activity (13, 14). We hypothesized that p53 accumulation in neuroblastoma is related to MYCN amplification
and expression and that p53 is a direct transcriptional target
of MYCN in neuroblastoma.
Here, we show that p53 protein expression correlates with
MYCN protein expression in both primary neuroblastoma tumors and neuroblastoma cell lines. Using a regulatable
MYCN expression system, p53 was found to be functional
and exhibited greater transcriptional activity in the presence
of MYCN leading to increased expression of several p53 target genes. Using quantitative MYCN ChIP, MYCN was found
to bind directly to the noncanonical E-Box motif (CATGTG)
within the p53 promoter in vivo, and using reporter gene assays, direct functional upregulation of transcription from the
p53 promoter by MYCN was shown. Furthermore, deletion of
this E-Box led to reduced transcriptional activity from the
p53 promoter by MYCN. This data provides strong support
to the model that this specific E-Box is responsible for
MYCN-mediated regulation of p53. The binding of MYCN
to an E-Box within the p53 promoter has very recently been
reported using ChIP-chip arrays (7), however, this study did
not include the functional upregulation of p53. Taken together, these findings provide an important and direct mecha-

nism by which MYCN is able to sensitize cells for p53mediated apoptosis.
Our data is both consistent with and provides a direct
mechanism to account for previous studies which have
shown that MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors expressed significantly higher levels of p53 RNA in comparison
with nonamplified tumors (7, 41, 42). It is also possible that
the association of p53 with undifferentiated, highly proliferative neuroblastoma we previously reported is mediated
through MYCN (12), and that MYCN may be involved in other studies linking p53 RNA expression with unfavorable neuroblastoma (43).
Our data is also in line with work in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model which showed that MYCN-driven tumor
formation had higher penetrance and reduced latency in p53
haploinsufficient mice, and that chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was shown to be p53-dependent, in which apoptosis
was significantly reduced in TH-MYCN p53+/− tumors compared with p53+/+ tumors (40).
Mechanisms by which members of the Myc family induce
apoptosis are not fully understood (reviewed in ref. 44). One
mechanism is via p14ARF-mediated increased p53 expression,
stability, and activity (45), although we have previously
reported that SHEP cells are homozygously deleted for
p14ARF (18), and this was further confirmed in the present
study (data not shown). However, p14ARF might be involved
in other neuroblastoma cell lines in addition, or instead of,
direct regulation of the p53 gene shown in the present study.
MYCN and p53 are both expressed in the normal embryonic developing nervous system, during the phase of precursor cell expansion prior to the onset of differentiation. In the
context of normal embryonic development, the present findings therefore provide a mechanism for MYCN-driven p53dependent apoptosis, which may be important in eliminating
any rapidly proliferating neuroblasts exposed to potential
teratogens to prevent deregulated proliferation and aberrations during development.
Our findings might help to explain why neuroblastomas
are initially chemosensitive; however, despite an initial response, more than half of all cases relapse with chemoresistant disease, suggesting that MYCN-amplified tumors
eventually develop mechanisms to evade MYCN-driven apoptosis (reviewed in ref. 9). There is evidence from cell line
studies that MYCN-amplified cell lines may circumvent
MYCN-driven p53-dependent apoptosis by selecting for cells
with aberrations in the p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway. Analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines reported to date with aberrations in the p53/MDM2/p14ARF pathway show that 25 of 34
(74%) cell lines are MYCN-amplified (Supplementary Information, Table S4) and predominantly established following
previous therapy at relapse (18), when abnormalities of the
p53 pathway in neuroblastoma tumors have been previously
reported (reviewed in ref. 10). A study examining the p53
pathway in relapsed MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas is
warranted.
Further illustrating the complexity of the paradoxical role
of MYCN in proliferation and apoptosis, MDM2, the critical
negative regulator of p53, has previously been reported to be

p53 Is a Direct Target Gene of MYCN

a direct target of MYCN (46). In the present study, siRNAmediated inhibition of p53 led to a decrease in MDM2
expression (data not shown), suggesting that increased expression of MDM2 in the presence of MYCN may also be dependent on the higher expression of p53 and not solely due
to direct upregulation by MYCN.
In conclusion, this study provides several lines of evidence
that p53 is a direct transcriptional target of MYCN in neuroblastoma and is likely to be a mechanism for MYCN-induced
p53-dependent apoptosis. However, the various selection
pressures on MYCN-amplified tumors either spontaneously
or via chemotherapy may lead to selection for those cells that
can evade apoptosis by various mechanisms which result in
MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma progressing to become such
a severe phenotype.
