Abstract

Author Manuscript

Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are secreted cytokines/growth factors that play differing
roles in cancer. BMPs are overexpressed in human breast cancers, but loss of BMP signaling in
mammary carcinomas can accelerate metastasis. We show that human breast cancers display
active BMP signaling, which is rarely downregulated or homozygously deleted. We hypothesized
that systemic inhibition of BMP signaling in both the tumor and the surrounding
microenvironment could prevent tumor progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we
used DMH1, a BMP antagonist, in MMTV.PyVmT expressing mice. Treatment with DMH1
reduced lung metastasis and the tumors were less proliferative and more apoptotic. In the
surrounding tumor microenvironment, treatment with DMH1 altered fibroblasts, lymphatic vessels
and macrophages to be less tumor promoting. These results indicate that inhibition of BMP
signaling may successfully target both the tumor and the surrounding microenvironment to reduce
tumor burden and metastasis.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted cytokine/growth factors belonging to the
Transforming Growth Factor β superfamily known for their pleiotropic functions. BMPs
have been historically defined by osteo-inductive capabilities, as well as roles in early
embryologic cell fate specification(1, 2). The BMP pathway consists of a well-defined
signaling cascade that begins with translation of more than 20 ligands, which must be
processed and bound to receptors as either homo or heterodimers(1). In the extracellular
space, ligands can be regulated by many secreted soluble antagonists including Noggin,
Chordin and Gremlin(1). Ligand binding stimulates type I and type II receptor serine/
threonine kinase phosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylate intracellular Smad proteins
[Smads 1, 5 and 8(mouse)/9(human)]. Phosphorylated Smads then partner with Smad4 to
translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of target genes, particularly
Id1 as the canonical BMP response gene(1). BMPs also induce Smad6, which functions to
block receptor Smad phosphorylation and promote receptor turnover, providing a finely
tuned negative feedback signaling pathway(3).

Author Manuscript

New roles for BMPs in cancer have been identified. The function of BMP mutation was
described in Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS-OMIM#174900) patients, where BMPR1A
is mutated and leads to benign hamartomas(4, 5). Loss of function mouse experiments in
skin also demonstrated benign hamartoma tumor formation when BMPR1a was absent or
lost(6–9). It has recently been shown that the BMP antagonist DAND5 (also known as
COCO) can regulate the reactivation of dormant metastatic breast cancer cells in the
lung(10). Additional tumor suppressive roles of BMP signaling have been identified in our
previous studies overexpressing a dominant negative form of the type II BMP receptor
(BMPR2)(11). However, BMPs have also shown a dual role in cancer, similar to TGFβ(12,
13). Much like TGFβ, BMP stimulation of tumor cells has demonstrated growth inhibition,
while enhancing cell migration and invasion (14, 15). BMPs have also been shown to
antagonize the TGFβ directed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-stem cell-like
phenotype(16, 17). This may suggest a role for BMPs in reversing the tumor promoting
EMT process, thereby promoting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition, such as the
reactivation of dormant cancer stem cells via COCO(10).

Author Manuscript

Unlike the dual roles of BMP function in the tumor, BMP-stimulated cells in the
surrounding tumor microenvironment typically have a tumor promoting phenotype based on
in vitro studies. BMP stimulation of fibroblasts can promote prostate tumor
angiogenesis(18). We found that BMP stimulation of mammary fibroblasts resulted in
enhanced tumor cell invasion and increased inflammatory cytokine secretion and matrix
remodeling factors(19). BMPs can also stimulate lymphangiogenesis, which may be utilized
by tumors to facilitate metastatic dissemination(20). When macrophages are stimulated by
BMP ligands, they produce inflammatory cytokines that could promote tumor progression
and metastasis(21–24).
The use of small molecule BMP antagonists has recently been shown to successfully reduce
prostate to bone metastases, lung cancer cell growth and reduce primary tumor growth of
mammary carcinomas(25–27). BMP inhibition in breast cancer reduces tumor growth by

inhibiting the cancer stem cell self-renewal via the p63 signaling network(25). DMH1, a
second-generation analog of dorsomorphin (DM), is a highly selective small molecule
inhibitor of BMP receptor (28–30). In contrast to DM and the first-generation analog
LDN-193189, both of which target TGFβ type-2 receptor, AMP-activated kinase, VEGF
type-2 receptor, DMH1 does not inhibit these kinases (30). Moreover, in contrast to other
reported BMP inhibitors (31), DMH1 does not significantly inhibit the TGFβ type-I
receptors, ALK4 and ALK5 (30). Thus, DMH1 is the most selective of the published small
molecule inhibitors of BMP signaling, with IC50 (concentration causing 50% of inhibition)
of 27, 108, <5 and 48 nM against the type-1 receptors ALK1, ALK2, ALK3 and ALK6,
respectively.

Author Manuscript

We hypothesize that BMP signaling is largely intact in breast cancer and dynamically active
in the tumor microenvironment, which may provide a unique therapeutic target of an
understudied pathway. We show in a murine breast cancer model that systemic inhibition of
BMP activity in both the tumor and the surrounding microenvironment reduces pulmonary
metastases.

Results
Human breast cancers and their metastases retain active BMP signaling

Author Manuscript

BMP ligands are overexpressed in human breast cancers(32–35). We sought to determine
whether the BMP signaling pathway is active or absent in breast tumor cells as well as in the
tumor microenvironment. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for pSmad1/5/9 demonstrated
strong reactivity in the epithelium as well as the surrounding stroma in normal human breast,
hyperplasia, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), Invasive Ductal Carcinomas (IDC) and
metastases to brain, bone, liver and lung (Fig. 1a–h). Quantified scoring of two human
breast tissue microarrays containing samples that were subdivided into normal, ADH-CIS
(atypical ductal hyperplasia-carcinoma in situ) and invasive revealed active BMP signaling
(Fig. 1i). In order to determine whether TGFβ/BMP/Activin receptors correlate with the
survival of breast cancer patients we turned to the publicly available database kmplotter
(kmplot.com). We compared expression of TGFβ and Activin receptors correlating with
relapse free survival (RFS) in breast cancer and found that high levels of either the type I or
type II receptors correlate with improved RFS (Fig. S1a–h). Interestingly, we found that the
two common core receptors that mediate BMP signaling (BMPR1A and BMPR2) displayed
the opposite trend and demonstrated that high BMPR1A and BMPR2 receptor expression
correlates with poor RFS (fig. 1J &1k).
Breast cancers do not frequently lose BMP signaling components

Author Manuscript

The recent publication of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) for breast cancer has made it
possible to determine significance of gene expression changes(36). We utilized the cBio
portal to search the TCGA database for changes in BMP signaling components(37, 38). We
discovered that 21 genes involved in BMP signaling were altered in at least 5% of the 950
patient samples in the provisional breast TCGA database (Fig. 1l). Of the 21 genes, we
found that only SMAD4 and BMP1 were reduced in human breast cancer. It should be noted
that while Smad4 mediates canonical BMP signaling, it also functions as a tumor suppressor

via TGFβ and Activin(39). Most BMP signaling components were not absent or decreased,
but actually amplified and/or upregulated, including ligands BMP2, BMP5, BMP6 and
BMP7 (Fig. 1l) which has previously been reported independently of the TCGA(32, 35).
What may confuse matters is that not only are ligands being upregulated, but also their
secreted antagonists such as NOGGIN, CHORDIN and GREMLIN appeared upregulated as
well (Fig. 1l). BMP receptor homozygous deletion and downregulation in TCGA patients
were extremely rare, and were countered with more patients that displayed upregulation of
BMP receptors (Fig. 1l & Supplementary Table S1). We searched for these 21 BMP-related
genes in 59 breast cancer cell lines and found higher percentages of alterations were
represented for these BMP signaling components (Fig. S1i). The largest difference was for
BMP7, which was only altered in 12% of human patient samples (Fig. 1l) and altered in
46% of cell lines (Fig. S1e), of which almost all changes were upregulation or gene
amplification.

Administration of DMH1 to mice reduces tumor burden

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of BMP signaling in breast and prostate
cancer can potentially provide therapeutic benefit(25, 27). Mice expressing the oncogene
Polyoma Middle T (PyVmT) have active pSmad1/5/8 in their primary tumors and
metastases(11). Female mice expressing MMTV.PyVmT were examined beginning at three
weeks of age, and upon tumor palpation were implanted with a 6 week slow-release osmotic
pump containing vehicle (DMSO) or DMH1 (Fig. 2a). After six weeks of treatment, tumors
were removed and H&E stained, which revealed that vehicle treated tumors exhibited
advanced carcinoma histology (Fig. 2b–c). Examination of H&E sections of the liver and
kidneys showed no evidence of toxicity associated with DMH1 administration (Fig. S2).
While the primary tumor size was not significantly altered (Fig. S3a–b), the number of
primary tumors was significantly (P=0.014) reduced in DMH1 treated animals (Fig. 2d). We
next stained primary tumors for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and found that treatment of
tumors with DMH1 significantly (P=0.001) reduced the number of Ki-67 positive tumor
cells (Fig. 2e–g). We then examined for apoptosis by IHC for cleaved caspase-3 and found a
significant (P=0.016) increase in positive cells in DMH1 treated primary tumors (Fig. 2h–j).
This discrepancy between tumor size, tumor number and proliferation from Ki-67 IHC may
be partially explained in the nature of the spontaneous tumors ability to have different
changes in stroma, tumor cells and cystic fluid filled tumors. To determine whether
BMPR1a (the target of DMH1) was inhibited, we performed pSmad1/5/8 IHC, which
revealed strong active BMP staining in vehicle (Fig. 2k) treated tumors, and diminished
staining in DMH1 treated tumors (Fig. 2l). To further validate whether tumors had a specific
response to BMP inhibition, we performed FACS isolation of epithelial cells and measured
three genes known to be active targets of BMP transcription(1). Both Smad6 and Id1
transcription were significantly downregulated with DMH1 treatment (Fig. 2m). Smad7 is
also a transcriptional target of BMP signaling, but may also be indicative of TGFβ family
signaling and not always specific to BMP signaling inhibited by DMH1. Because another
BMP inhibitor (LDN-193189) was recently shown to reduce primary tumor growth and
demonstrated a reduction in basal or cancer stem cells, we investigated changes in cell
lineages in the tumors(25). We found that ΔNp63 was not significantly altered in IHC (Fig.
S3c–d) or by qPCR (Fig. S3e), yet other basal factors such as K14 were altered, and

inversely correlated with K18 expression (Fig. S3e). Further qPCR analysis demonstrated
that DMH1 tumor cells did in fact show a reduction in key EMT/Stem cell-like related genes
such as Snail, Twist, Zeb1 and Zeb2 (Fig S3f). And while qPCR had a trend towards less
Vimentin and increased Ecadherin (Fig. S3f), no appreciable differences were observed by
IF staining for luminal (K8/18) and basal (K5) markers as well as EMT indicators Ecadherin
and Vimentin (Fig. S3g–j).
DMH1 treatment inhibits pulmonary metastases

Author Manuscript

While a recent report had demonstrated reduction in mouse mammary tumors treated with a
BMP inhibitor(25), we were curious to investigate the impact on metastasis. The MMTVPyVmT model is widely used because of its full metastatic penetrance phenotype, with
animals consistently developing pulmonary metastases (40). When 12 mice were compared
for both treatments it was found that a significant reduction in metastases occurred in DMH1
treated mice (Fig. 3a–c). Once lung metastases were counted, they were sectioned and
stained again with H&E, which confirmed the presence of PyVmT-carcinoma derived
metastases (Fig. 3d–e). To verify that DMH1 treatment had reduced BMP signaling, we
performed IHC and found a reduction in pSmad1/5/8 staining with DMH1 treatment (Fig.
3f–g). At the time of sacrifice, 0.5ml of peripheral blood was removed by cardiac puncture
and RNA was isolated to detect the presence of circulating tumor cells. qPCR for BMP
response gene Id1 was found to be significantly lower, as were other markers of tumor
epithelia and the oncogene transgene itself in DMH1 treated animals (Fig. 3h).
DMH1 treatment reduces the fibrotic response in tumors

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We have recently published work demonstrating how BMP stimulation of mammary
fibroblasts in vitro can promote mammary carcinoma invasion(19). We hypothesized that,
similar to in vitro experiments, DMH1 could reduce the tumor enhancing effects of cancerassociated fibroblasts. Upon examination of the tumor stroma, we noticed that vehicle
treated tumors appeared largely filled with carcinoma cells and that collagen (highlighted by
aniline blue) staining in Masson trichrome was abundant within the tumor (Fig. 4a). Tumors
treated with DMH1 had large regions of stroma with limited amounts of collagen (Fig. 4b).
We further investigated the tumor-stroma interface by performing IF staining for Collagen I,
which highlights the basement membrane around the tumors. Vehicle treated tumors
displayed a different staining pattern from that found with DMH1 treated tumors (Fig. 4c–
d). We next performed IF staining Collagen IV and found the nature of fibers to follow the
pattern indicated by trichrome and Collagen I IF staining (Fig. S4a–b). To further investigate
collagen fibers, we stained tumors with Picrosirius red, which when viewed under polarized
light can indicate the density of fibers. We did not find any morphological differences or
significance in the intensity of birefringence from collagen fibers stained with Picrosirius
red (Fig. S4c–g). IF staining for Fibronectin was sparsely populated in both the vehicle and
DMH1 treated tumors (Fig. S4h–i). Cancer associated fibroblasts can be identified by the
myofibroblast marker αSMA for which we performed IF staining and found a significant
(P=0.03) reduction in DMH1 treated primary tumors (Fig. 4e–g). αSMA also marks blood
vessels and myoepithelial cells in addition to cancer associated fibroblasts. To probe deeper
into the nature of the tumor-associated fibroblasts, we used the marker PDGFRα+ to
identify fibroblasts in primary tumors (Fig. 4h). We found that DMH1 treated tumors had a

slight, but not significant, increase in fibroblasts in primary tumors compared with vehicle
treated animals (Fig. 4i–k). To determine how these fibroblasts were functionally different
when treated with DMH1, we isolated PDGFRα+ cells using FACS and performed qPCR.
We found that the DMH1 treated fibroblasts gene expression was less tumor promoting with
increased Cav1 and decreased Adam17. Crosslinking factors known to promote metastasis
and matrix stiffness Lox and Loxl2(41–44) were also significantly reduced with DMH1
treatment (Fig. 4l). qPCR also demonstrated a reduction in αSMA in fibroblasts from
DMH1 treated tumors (Fig. 4l). In agreement with our previous findings in vitro(19), DMH1
treatment of primary tumors reduced Mmp2 and Ccl9 in fibroblasts (Fig. 4l). Both of these
factors are known to promote invasion and metastases, and can be stimulated by BMP in
mouse mammary fibroblasts(19). qPCR also revealed that BMP transcriptional targets Id1,
Smad6 and Smad7 were downregulated in fibroblasts (Fig. S4j).

DMH1 treatment results in decreased lymphatic vessel formation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The BMP pathway has been implicated in lymphatic vessel growth independent of blood
vessel growth, and it was suggested that inhibition of BMP signaling during tumor
metastatic dissemination could limit lymphatic growth into tumors and subsequently impair
metastasis(20). We performed IF for a marker of blood vessels (CD31) and lymphatic
vessels (LYVE) in primary tumors and found that vehicle treated tumors contained
lymphatic vessels within the tumors (Fig. 5a). DMH1 treated tumors displayed much less
LYVE positive cells, and were not located intra-tumorally (Fig. 5b). To observe total
vessels, we performed IF staining for the pan-endothelial marker MECA32 and the
basement membrane component Laminin. Similar to the architecture seen by H&E staining
(Fig. 2b–c) and in Collagen IV IF staining (Fig. S4 a–b), we found that vessel architecture
was localized throughout the tumor in vehicle treated animals in contrast to DMH1 treated
tumors where vessels remained at the periphery (Fig. 5 c–d). We further investigated the
total change in endothelial cells by performing flow cytometry for CD31 and CD102 dual
positive cells and found no significant change in blood vessels (Fig. S5a–d). FLT4 (also
known as VEGFR3) is a specific receptor on lymphatic cells(45, 46). We found that DMH1
treated tumors contained significantly less VEGFR3+ cells than vehicle control animals
(Fig. 5e–h). We additionally performed flow cytometry to analyze the lymphatic specific
marker LYVE, and found it was reduced as well in DMH1 treated tumors compared to
vehicle controls (Fig. 5i–l). To determine functional differences in lymphatic endothelial
cells, we performed FACS of both FLT4+ and LYVE+ cells from primary tumors, isolated
RNA and performed qPCR. We found that in both FLT4+ and LYVE-1 positive cells, Vegfc
expression was significantly down regulated, while the blood vessel growth factor Vegfa
was not (Fig. 5m). We further investigated the BMP response by qPCR for the FLT4+ and
LYVE+ cells and found that BMP response genes Id1 and Smad6 were significantly
downregulated (Fig. S5e). Taken together, these findings indicate the BMP inhibition with
DMH1 can inhibit lymphatic infiltration into tumors.
DMH1 treatment alters myeloid and lymphoid infiltrates to reduce immune promotion of
tumors
We first investigated the systemic in vivo effect of immune cells with DMH1 inhibition, and
found that the total number of myeloid and immune cells (CD45+) were significantly higher

in DMH1 treated animals compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 6a–d). T cell specific staining
demonstrated modest changes for CD8+ T cells (increased in DMH1 treated tumors);
however, CD3+ and CD4+ cells were not affected (Fig. S6a–d). We proceeded to investigate
if myeloid cell lineages were altered, and found that Gr-1+ cells were not different in their
percentage in the primary tumors (Fig. S6e–h). Interestingly, qPCR analysis of FACS
isolated Gr1+ cells found that DMH1 treated tumors were found to have less iNos and
Arginase gene expression (Fig. S6i). We next examined macrophages by flow cytometry and
found that there were more F4/80+ macrophages in primary tumors treated with DMH1 than
vehicle controls (Fig. 6e–h). We next localized these macrophages with IF staining and
found that F4/80 macrophages were localized within the tumor, while DMH1 treatment
resulted in macrophages being localized at the periphery of the tumors (Fig. 6-i-j). IF
staining for CD206 (mannose receptor), which has been indicative of the putative “M2
polarization” for tumor promoting macrophages(47) were densely found throughout the
vehicle treated tumors, yet reduced in DMH1 treated primary tumors (Fig. 6k–l).
Additionally, several genes known to promote metastasis and tumor progression from
macrophages, were found to be significantly reduced such as iNos, Cox2, Ccl5, Il18 and Il10
(Fig. 6m). These results indicate that myeloid cells are responsive to BMP inhibition and
this results in a less tumor promoting phenotype.

Author Manuscript

We next sought to test the direct effect of DMH1 on monocytes. We isolated hematopoietic
stem cells from femur flushes of C67BL6 females and converted the cells to monocytes by
treatment with M-CSF for 7 days (Fig. 7a). These monocyte cells were either left in normal
medium, treated with recombinant mouse BMP4, or recombinant BMP4 and DMH1. We
isolated RNA and synthesized cDNA and performed qPCR from these cells and found that
almost universally BMP4 stimulation had no effect on gene expression. However with
DMH1 treatment monocytes had significant reduction in expression of Arg1, Il10 and Il4
which are genes known for promoting immunosuppression in tumors as well as alternate M2
polarization of monocytes (Fig. 7b). We next examined gene expression for Mmp2, Mmp9
and Mmp13 and found that these genes where significantly decreased with DMH1 treatment.
Finally, we performed qPCR for genes indicating specific attenuation of the BMP pathway
with target genes Id1, Smad6 and Smad7, which were all significantly decreased with
DMH1 inhibition (Fig. 7d). Interestingly, BMP4 stimulation was either unresponsive or
what may be a saturation of BMP activity in monocyte cells that could only be reduced and
not enhanced (Fig. 7b–d)

Discussion
Author Manuscript

BMP signaling has largely been regarded to be tumor suppressive based on the landmark
studies by Howe et al. demonstrating the loss of BMPR1a in the formation of Juvenile
Polyposis Syndrome(4). Interestingly, the loss of BMPR1a results in hamartomas, which are
typically benign tumors(48). Recently, analysis from the TCGA revealed that while TGFβ
and Activin signaling components are frequently mutated, BMPR1a and other BMP specific
signaling components are not(49). These results suggest that many tumors may require core
developmental signaling pathways such as BMP signaling in order to progress and even
metastasize. Similar to TGFβ, it is a common mistake to simply label a pathway as tumor
suppressive or promoting. Like TGFβ, BMPs are being found to have distinct functions that

can both support and restrict tumorignesis(13). Further studies that define BMP activity
within the cells context and function will enhance decisions for patient therapy.

Author Manuscript

The BMP pathway has recently been considered for therapeutic intervention. In prostate
cancer, a recent report has shown that use of the Dorsomorphin analog LDN-193189 can be
used to block bone metastases by inhibiting the tumor cells mimicry of the bone
microenvironment(27). This is a rational strategy, originating from the hypothesis of the so
called “vicious-cycle” whereby tumor cells participate in the turnover of the bone,
potentially hijacking BMPs ability for osteoinduction that could be co-opted with the
tumor’s cells(49). BMP signaling has been shown to enhance human breast cancer cells
metastasis to the bone(50). BMP inhibition with LDN-193189 has now been used in mouse
models of breast cancer and shown to inhibit the ability of these tumors to self-renew via
ΔNp63(25). Interestingly, LDN-193189 is known to inhibit more than just BMPR kinase
activity, and could potentially represent a therapeutic option that inhibits VEGFR and other
known off-targets(51).

Author Manuscript

In this study, we show that BMP signaling remains high in both carcinoma and stromal cells
in human breast cancer, that high expression of BMP receptors is associated with less
relapse free survival, and that genes encoding proteins involved in BMP signaling are rarely
deleted or mutated in human breast cancers. Gene amplification and/or overexpression are
relatively frequent. To test the significance of BMP signaling, we used the small molecule
BMP antagonist, DMH1, in a mouse model of breast cancer and demonstrate that it
suppresses pulmonary metastases. We show that systemic inhibition of the BMP pathway
(which is active in both the tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment)
demonstrates anti-metastatic function. Changes in stromal volume were not affected by
DMH1 with regard to the percentage of cells that are fibroblasts (Fig. 4k), only partially in
lymphatics (Fig. 5h&l), and significantly for immune cells (Fig. 6d&h). The ratio of stroma
to tumor is a dynamic process in cancer and further studies will potentially uncover how
therapeutics successfully affects the ratio of these distinct cell populations. Our rationale has
been supported by in vitro reports of BMP tumor promoting effects in tumor cells(14, 15,
27, 34, 52–54), fibroblasts(18, 19), lymphatics(20) and immune components(21–24, 55) of
the tumor microenvironment. While many anti-cancer strategies target a single or unique
cell population, we demonstrate an approach that can integrate multiple cell types for
therapeutic targeting of mammary carcinoma metastasis.

RNA isolation of snap-frozen tissue was performed by placing tissue directly into Trizol
(Invitrogen) and purified by chloroform and alcohol precipitation. Trizol isolated RNA was
then subjected to cleanup with RNeasy purification including DNAseI treatment as was cells
isolated from FACS. RNA from blood was purified using the Mouse RiboPure Blood RNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion) following manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of RNA were
synthesized into cDNA using the VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). LuminoCt (Sigma)
2X SYBR mastermix was combined with 1uM of both a forward and reverse primer
sequence (full table of sequences is listed in Supplemental Table 2) into 20ul reactions and
cycled for 95degrees-10s to 60degrees for 30s for 40 cycles followed by a melting curve.
BioRad CFX96 was used and instrument provided software was used to determine relative
normalized expression to GAPDH expression. Use of human CAF cells were used as
previously described(19). Fibroblasts from de-identified breast cancer tissue were cultured at
sub-confluence and treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or DMH1(20µM) for 24 hours,
following fresh media replacement which was allowed to be conditioned for 48 hours and
used to treat a confluent monolayer of HCC1937 human breast cancer cells were ‘scratched’
to measure tumor migration as described previously(11).
Database utilization and statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

For analysis of the TCGA dataset, we used the cBio portal (http://www.cbio.portal.org/)(37,
38). Human gene symbols were queried in the provisional dataset and accessed on Jun 3rd
2013. RNA expression cutoff was maintained at the default of 2.0. Analysis of gene
expression correlating with RFS was performed using the kmplotter (http://kmplot.com).
Human gene symbols were entered into breast and JetSet probe selection was used to
determine optimal representative microarray probe(60). Automatic cutoff scores were
selected during queries and 10 year RFS were selected. Statistical analysis was performed
using Excel (Microsoft), Prism (Graphpad), and FlowJo (TreeStar) software. Statistical
significance was deemed for any comparison where P<0.05.

Figure 1. Bone Morphogenetic Protein signaling is active in human breast cancers and is rarely
absent

a) IHC for pSmad1/5/9 demonstrates that the BMP pathway is active in normal breast both
in the epithelium (black arrow) and in the surrounding stroma (red arrow). b) In precancerous DCIS lesions, heterogeneous staining showing BMP activation in both the
epithelium (black arrow) as well as the surrounding stroma (red arrow). c) BMP signaling is
quite strong and active in IDC not only in the primary tumor (black arrow) but also in the
stromal infiltrates surrounding the tumor (red arrow). d–f) In metastases to the lymph node
(d), brain (e), bone (f), liver (g), and lung (h) tumors exhibited strong staining for active

BMP signaling in tumor cells (black arrows) as well as the tumor microenvironment (red
arrows). i) IHC for pSmad1/5/9 was performed on two tissue microarrays purchased from
US bio max catalog #’s 480 and 722 which contained normal breast, pre-cancerous
hyperplasia's and invasive cancers. Scoring revealed that normal breast were 41/42 positive,
ADH-CIS were 24/26 positive and Invasive cancers were 36/38 positive for pSmad1/5/9. j)
BMP receptor IA (BMPR1A) was queried for correlation to overall survival of breast cancer
patients using kmplot.com and found that high expression (red) correlated with poor survival
(logrank P =1.3e-07). k) The type II BMP receptor BMPR2 high expression correlated with
poor survival using kmplot.com (logrank P =0.00092). l) Using the cBio portal
(cbioportal.org) to investigate BMP signaling components in the TCGA we found that in the
provisional breast database consisting of 950 total samples 21 BMP related genes altered in
greater than 5% of all patients. Solid dark red boxes indicate copy number amplification,
light pink indicates mRNA upregulation, dark blue indicates homozygous deletion, light
blue indicates mRNA downregulation and green boxes indicate mutations. Microscope scale

Figure 2. Mice treated with DMH1 reduce primary mammary tumor growth

a) FVBn mice expressing the MMTV.PyVmT constitutively expressed oncogene were
implanted with slow release (6 weeks) osmotic pumps after first palpation of tumors
(~7weeks). b) Vehicle (DMSO only, n=12) treated tumors were stained with H&E which
indicated advanced adenocarcinoma morphology. c) DMH1 treated animals (n=12) revealed
a much less advanced adenocarcinoma appearance. d) The number of tumors per animal
greater than .5cm in diameter were counted at sacrifice and revealed a statistically
significant (P=0.014) reduction with DMH1 treatment (1.92) compared to vehicle treated

significant (P=0.016) increase in apoptotic tumor cells (vehicle=.79, DMH1=1.62). k) IHC
for active BMP signaling with pSmad1/5/8 demonstrated that primary tumors are strongly
positive for BMP signaling. l) DMH1 treated tumors had reduced staining for pSmad1/5/8
indicating reduced yet not absent BMP signaling. m) EpCAM+ tumor cells isolated by
FACS had RNA isolated and SYBR qPCR was performed for BMP transcriptional targets,
which demonstrated a significant reduction in Id1 and Smad6. Normalized expression for
qPCR was performed in comparison to GAPDH expression. Quantification of IHC was
performed using NIH ImageJ software to detect pixels positive for stain in a 20X field of
view. A minimum of four tumors with at least five representative images were used in
analysis. # Indicate statistical significance (P=<0.05) by performing a student’s T-test. Error

Figure 3. The BMP receptor kinase antagonist DMH1 reduces metastases in the MMTV-PyVmT
transgenic mouse model of breast cancer

a) Control mice treated with vehicle (DMSO) showed typical lung metastatic burden after 6
weeks from the palpation of the primary tumor. b) Animals treated with DMH1 for 6 weeks
following initial tumor palpation had far fewer lung metastases. c) Metastases were counted
in lung whole mounts from a total number of 12 control and 12 DMH1 treated mice and
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in lung metastases (P=0.03). d–e) H&E
staining of lung metastases confirmed that whole mount stained lungs contained metastatic
tumor cells. f) IHC for pSmad1/5/8 demonstrated that spontaneous lung metastases

activity in BMP signaling by pSmad1/5/8. h) Peripheral blood was collected by cardiac
puncture at the time of sacrifice and RNA was isolated. SYBR qPCR was performed to
detect circulating tumor cells where markers for the tumors all showed reduction in DMH1
treated animals. Id1 transcription, which is the canonical indicator of BMP transcription,
was significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of DMH1 treated animals. Microscope
