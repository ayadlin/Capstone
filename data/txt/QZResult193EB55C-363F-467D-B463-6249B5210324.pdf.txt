ABSTRACT
The role of autophagy in cancers is controversial. Here we aim to determine the
prognostic significance of autophagy in colorectal carcinoma patients, thereby allowing
more rational development of therapeutic strategies. Through transmission electron
microscopy, our data first demonstrated high frequency of defective mitochondria
was strongly associated with poor overall survival in colorectal carcinoma. Next
immunohistochemical study showed the expressions of Beclin 1, LC3B and Bcl-xL
in both the center of tumor and adjacent noncancerous mucosal region were also
correlated with overall survivals. We developed an autophagy signature for prognosis
based on these three major autophagic proteins, further analysis suggested it was an
independent prognostic biomarker and had its value even within single clinical stage.
Combined TNM stage and this signature could significantly improve the accuracy
of survival prognosis. To validate these immunohistochemical results, an internal
testing cohort and an independent population were also included. Our findings
suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the clinical cancer progression.
Therefore autophagic proteins may be valuable prognostic biomarkers in the therapy
of colorectal carcinoma and possibly other types of cancers.

improve poor prognosis but also provide novel potential
targets for therapy.
Autophagy was discovered by transmission electron
microscopy(TEM) over 50 years ago [3], it is a conserved
pathway which degrades and recycles organelles (such as
mitochondria) and proteins to generate amino acids, ATP,
nucleotides, fatty acids and sugars to support cell survival
[4]. Autophagy can exert multifactorial influence on
tumorigenesis, tumor progression and cancer therapeutics
[5]. Dysfunctional mitochondria in tumor was first
observed by Warburg to explain that tumor cells undergo
increased aerobic glycolysis (“Warburg effect”) compared
to normal cells [6]. It remains enigma for decades why
cancer cells would use such an inefficient process to meet

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the fourth leading
cause of cancer related death in the world [1]. It is more
common in developed countries. However, the incidence
and mortality in some developing countries, such as China,
have continued to increase because their transition towards
the so-called western lifestyle such as the consumption
of high-fat diets and physical inactivity, and relatively
poorer health-care resources. Although great progress has
been achieved in the past decade, CRC patient survival
is still poor [2]. Accordingly it is of substantial value to
understand the pathogenic mechanisms and to figure out
new prognostic biomarkers not only because it could

their energy demands. Not until recently it is demonstrated
that reactive oxygen species produced by tumor cells are
transferred to the cellular microenvironment including
supporting host cells such as adipocytes, endothelia,
fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and immune cells [7].
Then it can start the oxidative stress responses like
autophagy in these cells, which lead to the production
of high energy metabolites for the anabolic cancer cells
to live and proliferation [7, 8]. This “parasitic cancer
metabolism” model suggests that during the development
of tumor, a large amount of dysfunctional mitochondria
would occur for the survival of cancer cells.
Besides morphological visualization, now there
are several proteins are commonly used as biomarkers
of autophagosome formation [9]. As the first discovered
autophagy effector in mammalian, Beclin 1 is has been
demonstrated to be deleted or decreased mono-allelically
in human breast, prostate and ovarian cancers [10–12].
Furthermore, several clinical researches associated
aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis with
aberrant expression of Beclin 1 [10, 13, 14]. In mice,
deficiency or inactivation Beclin 1 can lead to a high
incidence of tumors in liver, lung and lymphomas
spontaneously [15, 16]. The important effects of Beclin
1 in the induction of autophagy may be attributed to its
interaction with Bcl-xL [17]. As an anti-apoptotic protein
in Bcl-2 family, B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) was
first recognized as regulator in cell death and later had been
characterized in controlling Beclin 1-mediated autophagy
[18]. It has been reported low expression of Beclin 1 was
associated with poor survival in Bcl-xL overexpressed
ovarian cancer [19] and hepatocellular carcinoma [20].
Microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is
a homolog protein of yeast Atg8 in mammalian [17].
During autophagic process, phosphatidylethanolamine is
conjugated to LC3I (cytosolic form of LC3) to assemble
LC3-II, which will then be recruited to autophagosomal
membranes. Autophagosomes can fuse with lysosomes to
create autolysosomes, and LC3-II in the autolysosomal
lumen will be degraded [21]. As a result, the lysosomal
turnover of LC3-II can directly reflect autophagic activity in
cells. In particular, LC3 detection by immunofluorescence
or immunoblotting are usually treated as a reliable method
in monitoring autophagic process.
In this study, we examined the ultra-structural
details of mitophagy by transmission electron microscopy,
evaluated the expression level of Beclin 1, LC3B and BclxL in both colorectal tumor and adjacent noncancerous
mucosal tissues. We further developed an autophagyprotein-based classifier for survival prognosis and
compared its efficacy to other clinical-pathological risk
factors. The main purpose of this study was to explore the
clinical significance of autophagy in CRC development
and progression, and identify valuable prognostic
biomarker, thereby allowing more rational development
of therapeutic strategies against cancer.

Frequency of defective mitochondria and overall
survival
We first examined the morphology of mitochondria,
one of the major substrates of basal autophagy [9], from
205 primary colorectal carcinoma tissues (Figure 1A).
Defective mitochondria were observed in all tissues.
The defective mitochondria were characterized by
autophagosome, regular rupture in the outside part of
membrane, increased size, and a clear matrix because
of the cristolysis but without isolation membrane-like
structures. Along with the clinical progress of cancer, the
frequency of defective mitochondria elevated gradually.
Moreover, tumors from dead subjects had higher
proportion of defective mitochondria than survival patients
(Figure 1B). Here, we classified all 205 patients into highrisk subgroup (defective mitochondria account > 50% of
the total mitochondria) and low-risk subgroup (<50%)
(Figure 1C).The distribution of the clinicopathological
characteristics from these two subgroups was showed as
Table 1. As expected, low-risk patients had better survival
than high-risk subjects (Figure 1D). Kaplan-Meier
survival curves analysis demonstrated that 5-year overall
survival was 34% for the high-risk subgroup, and 75%
for the low-risk subgroup (HR, 4.72, 95% CI, 3.04–7.32;
p < 0·0001). Moreover, receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) analysis suggested the prognostic accuracy of
5-year overall survival was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73–0.85)
(Figure 1E).

Expression of Beclin 1, LC3B and Bcl-xL and
overall survival
Next we studied the expression of Beclin 1,
LC3B and Bcl-xL in both the center of tumor (CT)
area and noncancerous mucosal (NM) region. A total
of 526 primary CRC subjects were enrolled. The mean
age was 59 years (range 28–92 years), 261(50%)
were males and 211 (40%) died during the follow-up
period. The above 205 patients were assigned to the
training set, additional 160 participants from the same
hospital were included in the internal testing set, and
161 subjects from another hospital were treated as
independent validation set.
Beclin 1 and LC3B (Figure 2A) were moderately
expressed in CT area, but expressed robustly in NM
region. Conversely, Bcl-xL showed the reversed
expression patterns. As expected, the correlations among
these three proteins were robust in the NM region (Beclin
1 vs. LC3B, r = 0.86, p < 0.001; Beclin 1 vs. Bcl-xL,
r = –0.69, p < 0.001; Bcl-xL vs. LC3B, r = –0.65, p <
0.001). However, these correlations in CT weakened
(Beclin 1 vs. LC3B, r = 0.41, p < 0.01; Beclin 1 vs. Bcl-xL,
r = –0.32, p < 0.01; Bcl-xL vs. LC3B, r = –0.31, p < 0.01).

Tumor samples from subject who died had lower
Beclin 1 and LC3B expressions within both CT and
NM region compare with survival patients (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, the Bcl-xL expression only showed statistical
difference in CT region. To further assess OS, ROC curve
analysis was conducted to figure out the optimum cutoff
values [22] for Beclin 1CT (3.79), Beclin 1NM (4.52),
LC3BCT (4.34), LC3BNM (4.58), Bcl-xLCT (4.75) and
Bcl-xLNM (2.84) in the training set. These cutoff scores
could segregate the enrolled 526 participants into highexpression and low-expression protein subgroups. The
distribution of the clinicopathological characteristics from
different subgroups was showed as Table 2–7. As shown
in Figure 2C, higher levels of Beclin 1, LC3B and lower
expression of Bcl-xL in either CT or NM regions were
associated with better OS.

(Figure 4H), CEA concentration (Figure 4I), CA 19–9
concentration (Figure 4J) and autophagic signature.
We also performed stratified analysis in TNM stage II
(Figure 5A), III (Figure 5B) and IV (Figure 5C) patients
from all enrolled patients to assess the survival prognosis
ability of autophagic protein signature within the same
clinical stage. Patients in TNM stage I were excluded
because the limited participants. Compared with lowrisk subjects, high-risk patients had worse OS in all
individual stages. These result demonstrated autophagic
protein signature was an independent prognostic factor for
patients with colorectal carcinoma.

Comparison of autophagic-protein signature and
TNM stage
In clinical practice, TNM staging system is believe
to be the critical prognostic determinant for patients with
cancer. ROC analysis suggested that our autophagic
protein signature had a similar survival prognostic ability
as TNM stage (Figure 6). We then created a prognostic
model combining autophagic protein signature and
TNM stage based on the internal training set [24, 25].
It had a better prognostic value than either TNM stage
or autophagic protein signature alone in the training set
(Figure 6A), which were corroborated in the internal
validation (Figure 6B) and independent sets (Figure 6C).

Autophagic protein signature and OS
In order to study the significance of the autophagic
proteins for survival prognosis, a formula was developed
to measure the risk taking account the strength of all
three proteins studied [23]. Risk score = 3.554–(0·248 ×
Beclin 1CT)–(0·451 × LC3BCT) + (0.214 × Bcl-xLCT) +
(0.095 × Beclin 1NM) – (0.492× LC3BNM) – (0.082 × BclxLNM). Using this formula, participants in the training set
were categorized into high-risk and low-risk subgroup
with risk score = 0 as cutoff value. The details of clinical
and pathological characteristics were showed in Table 8.
Compared with high-risk patients, low-risk subjects had
better OS (Figure 3A, left panel). The prognostic accuracy
was assessed by time-dependent ROC analysis (Figure 3A,
middle panel). Five-year overall survival was 33% for
the high-risk subjects, and 77% for the low-risk patients
(HR, 4.25; 95% CI, 2.67–6.78; p < 0.0001; Figure 3A,
right panel). Same cutoff value were also applied to both
internal and external test cohorts. As expected, subjects
in both sets with high-risk had worse OS. Five-year OS
rate was 73% for the low-risk patients and 37% for the
high-risk subjects in internal test cohort (HR, 3.52; 95%
CI, 2.09–5.94; p < 0.0001; Figure 3B). As for independent
validation set, five-year OS rate was 77% for the low-risk
subjects and 35% for the high-risk patients (HR, 4.50;
95% CI, 2.57–7.86; p < 0.0001; Figure 3C).

DISCUSSION
In this study, our results demonstrated high
frequency of defective mitochondria was correlated with
worse OS in CRC. The expressions of Beclin 1, LC3B
and Bcl-xL in both tumor area and adjacent noncancerous
mucosal region were also associated with overall
survivals. Furthermore, we developed an autophagy
protein based classifier as a more sensitive prognostic
tool. This signature was an independent factor for OS and
combined it with TNM stage could improve the prognostic
efficacy significantly. Our results suggest that autophagy
play an important role in the clinical cancer progression.
Moreover, in situ analysis of autophagic related proteins
could be valuable in survival prognosis and potential drug
targets in the treatment of CRC and possibly other types
of cancers.
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles
through changes in overall mass, interconnectedness, and
sub-cellular localization [26], deficiencies in autophagy
can cause the accumulation of defective mitochondria,
which may subsequently induce DNA damage, oxidative
stress and chromatin instability [27, 28]. Most of these
results came from basic research, here the frequency of
accumulated defective mitochondria in human tissues
were quantified for the first time. We observed defective
mitochondria in all 205 samples examined; further
analysis suggested that the frequency of defective

Autophagic signature as an independent
prognostic factor
We next conducted multivariable Cox regression
analysis to evaluate whether the prognostic ability of
this autophagic protein signature was independent of
pathological and clinical factors (Table 9). Selected
characteristics included gender (Figure 4A), tumor
location (Figure 4B), age (Figure 4C), family history
of cancer (Figure 4D), tumor size (Figure 4E), tumor
differentiation (Figure 4F), T stage (Figure 4G), N stage

mitochondria was robustly correlated with clinical
progress and strongly associated with clinical outcomes
in human colorectal carcinoma. These data suggested
the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells were very
common phenomena in CRC, the accumulated defective
mitochondria might reflect the nutrient uptake activity
in cancer cells. With the development of cancer, this
reprogrammed metabolic activities could provide extra
energy for tumor proliferation. As a result, high frequency
of defective mitochondria indicate poor OS in CRC
patients.
Although dysregulation of Beclin 1 and LC3
have been investigated in a wide variety of tumors, the
role of these proteins in colorectal carcinoma was still
controversial, especially when the survival prognosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was involved [29]. It was first demonstrated high Beclin
1 expression was associated with good OS in advanced
colon cancer [30], while Guo et al. showed patients
with low Beclin 1 expression had longer progression
free survivals [31]. As for LC3, it was reported there are
three different staining patterns of LC3A with opposite
significant in survival prognosis [32]. Although BclxL could regulate the activity of Beclin 1 and control
mitochondrial quality [33], no study focus on the role
of Bcl-xL in prognosis had been ever reported. Here we
detected the expressions of Beclin 1, LC3B and Bcl-xL
in both tumor and adjacent noncancerous regions from
526 CRC patients. Interestingly, although the expressions
between these three proteins were correlated in tumor
region, these correlations were not as robust as those in
7099

Oncotarget

the noncancerous tissues. These results supported the
hypothesis that the dynamic autophagic processes in the
center of tumors were different from those in the adjacent
noncancerous mucosal tissues. In our study, Beclin 1 and
LC3B were more likely under-expressed in the central
tumor area compare to those in the adjacent noncancerous
mucosal regions; while Bcl-xL showed the reversed
expression patterns. In addition, their expressions were
strongly associated with survival. Furthermore, although
the adjacent noncancerous areas were usually treated as
“normal”, the expression patterns of autophagic proteins
could also predicted, but in a much less extent, clinical
outcome. These results suggested that the autophagic
activities in the adjacent noncancerous area was strongly
affected by the tumor microenvironment, and might play
a role in promoting tumor proliferation.
Several mechanisms were introduced to explain
the tumor-suppressing effect of autophagy. First, lack
or inhibition of autophagy resulted in up-regulation of
ROS [7], this could cause several types of DNA damage
such as polyploid nuclei, increased double-strand breaks
and gene amplification [34]. The accumulation of DNA
damage in cells made them more susceptible during cancer
development [35]. Second, it is reported that oncogenic
signals were activated during autophagic process and
established oncogene induced senescence [36]. Since
senescence was characterized as a key obstacle during
the development of tumor in many cancers [37], this also
could partly explain how autophagy is involved in tumor
suppression. Third, many known anti-oncogenes like
Ampk, Lkt, Pten, and LKB1 usually functioned as positive
effectors in the autophagic process [38–41], whereas
many oncogenes, including the class I PI3K and Akt can
suppress autophagy [42]. Therefore, the competition
between oncogenes and tumor suppression genes might
partly reflected by the autophagic activity. Furthermore,
autophagy reduced inflammation and intratumoral
necrosis which is essential for cancer development [43].
Accordingly, deficiency or inactivation of autophagic
activity could eventually increase the susceptibility of
cancer and characterized as a valuable prognosis tool [34].
Prognostic evaluation is vital for the formation of
appropriate therapeutic strategy. In clinical practice, TNM
staging system is the major decisive factor for prognosis
in CRC patients currently. However, its limitations in
predicting the survival time of CRC patients are also
very clear giving it has been reported that patients within
the same stage show a wide varieties in their clinical
outcomes. Our finding of autophagic-protein signature
indicates that autophagy can be a powerful prognostic tool
in clinic treatment of colorectal carcinoma. In addition,
this signature shows predictive value in stage II, III,
and IV patients in stratified analysis, so this signature
can categorize patients within the same TNM stage into
high-risk and low-risk subgroup with remarkably distinct
survival prospects, suggesting it can significantly improve
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the accuracy of CRC prognosis. Further ROC analysis
reveals that TNM stage and the autophagic protein
signature have similar survival prognostic abilities.
TNM staging is done primarily based on the anatomical
information, while autophagic protein signature shows the
molecular characteristics and supplies different clues from
TNM staging. In this study, we illustrated that combination
of them were more accurate than TNM staging alone
in survival prediction, implying the autophagic protein
signature was able to consolidate the prognostic value
of TNM staging. Lastly, patients within the same TNM
staging colorectal carcinoma could be further stratified
into distinguishing risk subgroups based on the autophagic
protein signature, and accordingly treated with different
intensities strategically to improve the clinic outcomes.
Such stratification would result in a more personalized
treatment for CRC patients.
The present study also has several limitations.
First of all, this is a retrospective research; prospective
studies involving long-term follow-up of CRC patients
are needed to validate our results. Second, this research
was conducted on Chinese patients only; the distribution
of clinical characteristics might be different in other areas,
making it susceptible to the inherent biases of such a
study format. It would have provided more information if
other kinds of races are included. Third, only three major
autophagic related proteins were analyzed in current study
since it is difficult to label all the proteins involved in
autophagic processes. However, even with three proteins
it is still possible to show significant prognostic efficacy
that are supported by previous studies and biologically
plausible.
In summary, our results suggest the autophagy
related organelle and proteins can be applied in survival
prognosis, and therefore, the potential therapeutic targets
against cancer. We realize that large-scale, prospective
studies are needed to prove our data before this autophagic
protein signature can be used in clinical practice, but our
research guarantees further studies in both basic and
clinical fields. Ultimately, our result is bound to be of great
value for the study of other types of tumors.

METHODS
Clinical specimens
We obtained 526 pathologically proven primary
colorectal carcinoma, all of these tumors were
adenocarcinomas. For the training and internal testing
set, 365 specimens were acquired from Third Affiliated
Hospital of Harbin Medical University between Jan, 2004
and Aug, 2007. Patients without tumor sample from initial
diagnosis, previous treatment with any anti-cancer therapy
and preoperative death were excluded from this study.
Both carcinoma part and matched noncancerous mucosal
part (1.5–5.0 cm away from the edge of carcinoma) of
7100

all samples were immediately obtained after surgery.
Of these 365 samples, 205 were processed for both
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron
microscopy observation. The remaining 160 samples were
just for IHC. We included another 161 patients, with the
same criteria, from Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
Medical University between Apr, 2002 and May 2008 as
independent validation set. Clinical and histopathological
variables were characterized according to the UICC-TNM
staging system. The observation time in these cohorts were
defined as the interval between initial diagnosis and last
time of contact (either death or last follow up). Overall
survival (OS), calculated as the period from the date of
initial diagnosis to death of the same patient, was used
for prognostic analyses. The authors state that they have
obtained appropriate institutional review board approval
from both two participating hospitals and have followed
the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for
human or animal experimental investigations. In addition,
informed consent has been obtained from all participants
involved.

section including both the border of cancer and crosssectional area. The FFPE tissue sections were cut and
de-paraffinized in xylene and then rehydrated with ethanol
solutions. The tissues were subsequently placed in EDTA
(pH 8.0) and autoclave for 5 min at 121°C. After the
antigenicity was retrieved, the sections were submerged
in 3% H2O2 for 15 min to quench the endogenous
peroxidase. The sections were then washed with PBS
for three times, incubated with the antibodies overnight
against Beclin 1 (Abcam, ab97505, dilution 1:250), LC3B
(LC3 isoform B, Abcam, ab48394, dilution 1:300), BclxL (Santa Cruz, H-5: sc-8392, dilution 1:200) at 4°C. The
tissues were placed in peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin
for 30 min, and the final results can be observed with
diaminobenzidine. For negative control, PBS replaced the
above primary antibody.
The assessments of immune-staining were evaluated
according to the guideline previously reported [9], the
staining intensity was scored as follows: strong staining
(score 3), moderate staining (score 2), faint staining
(score1) and no staining at all (score 0). The distribution of
stained protein was defined as the percentage accounting
for the whole area in the section and scored as follows:
76–100% (score 4), 51–75% (score 3), 26–50% (score
2), 1–25% (score 1) and negative (score 0). The total
expression scores were evaluated by combined the
evaluations of both staining distribution and staining
intensity, and subjected to overall survival analysis. The
results of staining were evaluated by two researchers
(M.Y and H.Z). If both of them agreed with the results,
the score was determined. If the values were different, the
third researcher (B.Z.) would involve in the evaluation and
they worked together to get a final score.

Transmission electron microscopy
Tissues were first placed in solution containing
2% paraformaldehyde, 3% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1M
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h. After the samples were
fixed, they were washed and treated with 0.1% Milliporefiltered cacodylate-buffered tannic acid, post-fixed with
1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and stained
en bloc with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. The
samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations
of ethanol, infiltrated, and embedded in LX-112 medium
followed by polymerization in a 70°C oven for 2d.
Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranylacetate
and conterstained with lead citrate. Tissue sections were
studied at 80kV in JEM 1010 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL, USA). Since TEM technique itself
may cause sampling artifacts frequently, we randomly
selected a minimum of ten different spots from each
sample nonbiased. Then the number of both normal
mitochondria and defective mitochondria were counted for
quantification analyses (the percentage of dysfunctional
mitochondria) and every single cell had the same
probability to be observed in the study. Usually the data
were evaluated by two independent researchers (M.Y. and
H.Z). If both of them achieved agreement with the results,
the value was determined. If the results were different, the
third researcher (B.Z.) would involve in the evaluation and
they worked out the final score.

Selection of cutoff scores
In order to determine the cutoff values of Beclin
1, LC3B and Bcl-xL for overall survival, the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied in
the training set as reported previously [22]. In brief, by
maximizing the sum of specificity and sensitivity and
minimizing the overall error and the distance of the cutoff
value to the top-left corner of ROC curve, the optimum
cutoff value was calculated. Here, the clinical outcome
were classified into two categories according to survival
conditions; i.e. death because of colorectal carcinoma vs.
all the other outcomes like survival, censored or death but
from other causes.

Construction of autophagic signature and TNM
prognostic classifier

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Stratified analysis was conducted to examine
whether the association between autophagic protein
signature and overall survivals was independent of stage
as previous reported [24, 25]. One prognostic score model

IHC analyses were performed as previously
described [44]. All paraffin sections were first
evaluated by H&E staining to choose one proper tumor

including only the autophagic protein signature and TNM
stage as covariates were constructed. The regression
co-efficient of the autophagic signature in proportional
hazards models was divided by the co-efficient of TNM
staging, the yielded value was subsequently rounded up or
down to an integer number to get the score needed. ROC
analysis were performed to compare the prognostic power
of the combined model with the TNM stage or autophagic
signature.

Statistical analysis
The relation between clinical characteristics and
autophagic protein expression were assessed with χ2 test,
Student’s t test, or Fisher’s exact test depending on the
context. The log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis were
applied to measure the overall survival, and hazard ratios.
We investigated the prognostic or predictive accuracy
of each feature and multi-protein-based classifier using
receiver operating characteristic analysis. The area under
curve (AUC) analysis was used to measure prognostic or
predictive accuracy. All the analyses were performed with
MedCalc 13.0 and significance was defined as p < 0.05.
