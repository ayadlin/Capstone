ABSTRACT
Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetics is a class of
new anticancer agents. However, most cancers exhibit de novo or acquired resistance
to SMAC mimetics, posting a problem for broad applications in clinic, and highlighting
the necessity of exploring combinational strategies to circumvent SMAC mimeticresistance. We here showed that Norcantharidin, a drug that is currently being used
in cancer treatment, significantly enhanced SMAC mimetic Birinapant-mediated cell
viability inhibition and robustly promoted apoptosis in established breast carcinoma
cell lines, as well as in primary breast carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, we revealed
that Norcantharidin effectively reduced the levels of two major protein isoforms
of cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein(c-FLIP), namely c-FLIP long (c-FLIPL) and
c-FLIP short (c-FLIPS). Moreover, Norcantharidin markedly enhanced Birinapanttriggered caspase-8/caspase-3 cascade. Inhibition of caspase-8 activity by a synthetic
peptide Z-IETD-FMK significantly attenuated cell death induction by the combination,
suggesting that caspase-8 plays a critical role in the anticancer action. In conclusion,
our study suggests that the combination of SMAC mimetics with Norcantharidin
represents a novel strategy in breast cancer therapy and warrants further studies.

INTRODUCTION

inhibiting the activation of initiator caspase-9, and effector
caspases-3/7, while cIAP-1/2 are involved in negatively
regulating death-receptor-mediated caspase-8 activation
through interaction with Receptor-Interacting Protein
(RIP1). CIAP-1/2 also play important roles in regulating
tumor cell survival pathways such as Nuclear Factor
kappaB (NF-κB) signaling [3, 4]. These IAP family
members are significantly up-regulated in breast cancer
tissues and cancer cells, and are negatively correlated with
patient survival. As such, targeting IAPs is a promising
therapeutic strategy for breast cancer [3].
The antiapoptotic function of IAPs could be
neutralized by Second mitochondria-derived activator of
caspases (SMAC) protein [5]. Small molecules mimicking
the proapoptotic function of cellular SMAC protein are
a kind of novel anticancer agents. Like SMAC protein,
these small molecules are able effectively to target cellular
IAP-1/-2 (cIAP-1/-2) for degradation and also inhibit the

Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer
in women, and represents a major public health problem
worldwide. In last few decades, several advances, such as
early diagnosis and hormonal therapy, have considerably
improved the general survival for patients with breast
cancer [1]. Nevertheless, the prognosis for patients with
aggressive or metastatic breast cancers remains poor.
Hence, it is imperative to explore new therapies for those
breast cancer patients [2].
Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins are key
negative regulators of apoptosis. X-linked IAP (XIAP),
cellular IAP-1 (cIAP-1) and cellular IAP-2 (cIAP-2)
are among the most intensively studied family IAP
members. All these three IAPs have been documented as
potent endogenous inhibitors against apoptosis signaling

antiapoptotic function of X-linked IAP (XIAP). These
inhibitory effects on IAP proteins by SMAC mimetics
leads to TNFα-triggered activation of caspase-8 and
caspas-3 cascade and thus inducing apoptosis in cancer
cells which secrete TNFα in an autocrine fashion [6, 7].
Since the advent in 2004, numerous SMAC mimetics
have been synthesized for anticancer drug development.
Birinapant (TL32711) is a dimeric SMAC mimetic.
Preclinical studies revealed that Birinapant has potent
antitumour activity in a range of cancers, and also has
favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
properties. Therefore, Birinapant is being tested in clinical
trials for the treatment of cancer patients. Nevertheless,
like several other SMAC mimetics drug candidates,
Birinapant had weak or modest single-agent antitumor
activity in clinic although it effectively suppressed the
expression of IAP proteins in tumor tissues [8–10]. As a
result, considerable research emphasis is currently being
placed on identifying optimal combinations to improve
SMAC mimetic-based cancer therapy [8–10].
Norcantharidin (NCTD) is a naturally occurring
plant derived compounds that is routinely used to treat
patients with cancer in China [13–15]. Previous studies
have revealed that NCTD potently inhibited the expression
of several oncogenic proteins [11–13]. Notably, a recent
study reported that NCTD suppressed the expression
of cellular FLICE-like inhibitor protein (c-FLIP) in
esophageal cancer cells [14]. As endogenous inhibitors
of caspase-8 activation, two major protein isoforms of
c-FLIP, namely c-FLIP long (c-FLIPL) and c-FLIP short
(c-FLIPS) have been recognized as critical negative
regulators for SMAC mimetics-triggered extrinsic
apoptosis signaling [15, 16]. We therefore investigated
whether NCTD could promote Birinapant-mediated
anticancer activity through inhibition of c-FLIP in breast
cancer cells.

other two cell lines. These results suggest that MDAMB-468 and these two breast cancer cell lines are resistant
to Birinapant. We next examined the effect of this SMAC
mimetic on the expression of IAPs in MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-415 cell lines. Western
blotting analysis showed that Birinapant at 10 nM was
able to reduce the level of c-IAP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cell
line, and at 10 nM reduce the c-IAP-1 to minimal level in
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-415 cell lines (Figure 1B).
Birinapant also inhibited the expression of XIAP, albeit to
less extent than the inhibition of c-IAP-1.

NCTD represses the expression of c-FLIP in
breast cancer cells
We examined the effect of NCTD on the expression
of a panel of critical apoptosis-related proteins, including
c-FLIP, XIAP, c-IAP-1, Survivin, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and Bad,
in these breast cancer cell lines. We treated the cells
with 10, 20 and 40 μM of NCTD for 48 h since CCK-8
assay showed treatment with this concentration-range of
NCTD partially inhibited cell viability in these 4 cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Western blotting analysis
showed that NCTD effectively reduced the protein level
of c-FLIPL and also the protein level of c-FLIPS in all
four cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1C). Specifically, NCTD at 10 μM
partially inhibited the levels of c-FLIP proteins expression,
while at 20 and 40 μM reduced c-FLIP proteins expression
to negligible levels in these breast cancer cells. We
next used qRT-PCR assay to investigate the effect of
NCTD on the mRNA expression of c-FLIP in MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines treated by NCTD
(Supplementary Figure 1D). We found that treatment
with NCTD for 24 h, the mRNA level of c-FLIP was
significantly inhibited in both cell lines, suggesting that
the c-FLIP inhibition might be through a transcriptional
mechanism. Interestingly, we noted that NCTD at 40 μM
modestly decreased Mcl-1 level in MDA-MB-231 cell
line, but not in other three cell lines. This Mcl-1 inhibition
might be caused by the cytotoxic effect of NCTD at this
high concentration in this cell line (Figure 2). In contrast,
NCTD had no or little effect on the expression levels of
other proteins in these breast cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
Birinapant inhibits the expression of IAPs in
breast cancer cells
We first tested the activity of Birinapant in a panel
of 4 human breast cancer cell lines, including MDAMB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-415 and AU565 cell
lines using CCK-8 cell viability assay. Consistent with
numerous previous reports showing that MDA-MB-231
cell line belonged to the most SMAC mimetic-sensitive
cell lines [7–9, 16–19], we found that Birinapant potently
inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 cell line, with an
IC50 value of 15 nM after treatment for 48 h. In MDAMB-468 cell line, treatment with Birinapant at 10,000 nM
for 48 h only inhibited cell viability by 40%, and treatment
for longer time did not increase the activity of Birinapant
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure 1A). Moreover,
Birinapant also only slightly inhibited cell viability in

NCTD sensitizes breast cancer cells to
Birinapant-mediated cell viability assay
Since c-FLIP is a critical mediator of SMAC
mimetic-resistance in cancer cells [15, 16], we
hypothesized that suppression of c-FLIP by NCTD could
sensitize breast cancer cells to Birinapant-mediated
anticancer activity. We then examined the combinational
effect of Birinapant with NCTD in these breast cancer
cell lines by CCK8 assay. In MDA-MB-231 cell line, we
found that Birinapantat at 10 nM inhibited cell viability

by 34% in MDA-MB-231 cell line, whereas Birinapant in
combination with NCTD at 10, 20 and 40 µM inhibited
cell viability by 53, 80 and 97%, respectively. These
results showed that NCTD further sensitized this SMAC
mimetic-sensitive breast cancer cell line to Birinapantmediated anticancer activity (Figure 3A). CCK8 assay
further showed that NCTD also enhanced Birinapantatactivity in other 3 SMAC mimetic-resistant cell lines
(Figure 3B). Combination index (CI) analysis revealed that
the combination showed synergistic effect in all 4 breast
cancer cell lines when Birinapantat was combined with
NCTD at 20 and 40 µM, and showed synergistic or additive
effect in all 4 cell lines when combined with NCTD at
10 µM. These results suggest that NCTD is able to convert
SMAC mimetic-resistant cancer cell lines to sensitive ones
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, it is noted that SMAC mimetic

Birinapant as a signal-agent could not completely inhibit
cell viability in these cancer cell lines (Figure 1, and solid
squares in Figure 3A). Even in the most sensitive MDAMB-231 cell line, approximately 10% of cells survived 48
h-treatment by 300 nM Birinapant (Figure 1A). However,
in combination with NCTD, Birinapantat at much lower
concentrations (10 nM for MDA-MB-231, 300 nM for
MDA-MB-468 and 300 nM for MDA-MB-415) inhibited
cell viability almost by 100% in the cells, indicating a
strong cytotoxic effect by the combination.

NCTD enhances Birinapant-mediated anticancer
activity in breast cancer cells
We used NCTD at 20 µM in this apoptosis assay
because NCTD at this concentration markedly inhibited

the protein levels of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS expression but
had minimal single-agent activity in these breast cancer
cell lines. We treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cell lines with Birinapant alone, NCTD alone or both for
48 h. We then examined apoptosis in the treated cells by
Annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometery assay. In
MDA-MB-231 cell line, we found that after normalized
to DMSO control, Birinapantat at 20 nM alone induced
apoptosis in 40% cells, and NCTD had weak apoptotic
effect. In contrast, the combination induced apoptosis
in about 67% cells, showing the strong sensitization of
Birinapant-mediated apoptosis by NCTD (left panel,
Figure 4A, 4B). In MDA-MB-468 cell line, we found
that Birinapant at 100 nM or NCTD at 20  µM alone
induced apoptosis only in approximately 10% cells. In
striking contrast, their combination induced apoptosis in
approximately 50% cells (right panel, Figure 4A, 4B),
consistent with strong inhibitory effect on cell viability by
the combination in this cell line.
We next performed colony formation assay in
MDA-MB-468 cell line and found that either single
agent could reduce the colony formation as compared to
DMSO treatment. In contrast, their combination had much
stronger activity in reducing colony formation than either
single agent. These results suggest that the combination
have greater inhibitory effect on long-term growth of
breast cancer cells (Figure 4C).

We next performed western blotting analysis to
dissect major apoptosis signaling pathways triggered
by Birinapant alone, NCTD alone or both in three cell
lines. Because the apoptosis signaling activation is an
early event, we treated the breast cancer cells for 24 h.
In MDA-MB-231 cell line, treatment with Birinapant at
20 nM alone induced modest accumulation of proteolytic
activated bands of initiator caspase-8 and executioner
caspase-3, as well as accumulation of cleaved poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP). Addition of NCTD noticeably
increased these actions, consistent with the aforementioned
results that NCTD enhanced Birinapant-mediated apoptosis
in this SMAC mimetic-sensitive cell line (Figure 5A). In
MDA-MB-468 cell line, treatment with signal agents had
no or minimal effect on activation of caspase-8, -3, and
PARP cleavage. In striking contrast, their combination
induced robust accumulation of cleaved PARP and
activated caspase-8, -3, accompanied by marked decreases
of pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-3, as well as decreases
of full-length PARP (fl-PARP) (Figure 5A). Dosedependently enhanced activation of caspase-8, caspase-3
and PARP cleavage were noted in MDA-MB-415 cell line
(Figure 5B). Additionally, the combination had no effect on

the activation of caspase-9, an initiator caspase for intrinsic
apoptosis (data not shown).
Moreover, SMAC mimetics-mediated anticancer
activity primarily depends on TNFα-triggered caspase8-dependent extrinsic apoptosis pathway [6, 7]. We thus
investigated whether the enhancement of Birinapantmediated anticancer activity by NCTD in breast cancer
cells was through a similar mechanism. In this regard, we
first pretreated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
with Z-IETD-FMK, a specific caspase-8 inhibitor for 1 h,
and then treated the cells by combination for another 48 h.
We found that cell death induction by the combination
was significantly attenuated by the caspase-8 inhibitor
(Figure  5C, 5D). We next pretreated with neutralizing

antibodies (2 µg/ml) against TNFα and TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) for 2 h, and then treated
with the combination for another 48 h. We found that cell
death induction by the combination was effectively blocked
by the TNFα, but not by the TRAIL antibodies in both cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting that apoptosis
induction by the combination is triggered by TNFα.

induction in primary breast cancer cells
We further evaluated the response of primary
breast cancer cells to NCTD alone, Birinapant or the
combination to explore the clinical relevance of this

DISCUSSION

combination strategy. Primary breast cancer cells freshly
isolated from surgically resected tumor tissues of 8 female
patients were tested. The mean tumor size was 35 ±14 mm
(ranging 15 mm to 58 mm) (Supplementary Figure 3). No
patients received chemotherapy before operation. After
single cell suspension isolation, breast cancer cells were
treated by 20 µM NCTD alone, 0.1 µM Birinapant alone,
or their combination for 48 h, and analyzed for cell death
by trypan blue assay. We found that Birinapant induced
obvious cell death only in 1 primary breast cancer cells,
while had no or modest effect in other 7 primary breast
cancer cells. Moreover, NCTD alone had little or no
effect in these primary cells. In contrast, the combination
effectively triggered massive cell death in the primary
breast cancer cells from No.5 case. Of note, as compared
to either single-agent treatment, the combination effect
in primary cancer cells from this case was significantly
improved (p < 0.05) (Figure 6B). Western blotting showed
that NCTD markedly reduced the level of c-FLIP and
enhanced Birinapant-triggered caspase-3 activation and
PARP cleavage in primary breast cancer cells of case 5,
suggesting a similar mechanism as in established cancer
cell lines (Figure 6B).

Small molecule SMAC mimetics are newly
developed anticancer agents. Preclinical studies
demonstrated that SMAC mimetics potently induced
apoptosis in certain types of cancers and effectively
inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models, suggesting
that SMAC mimetics hold promise for human cancer
patients. Nevertheless, clinical trials showed that resistance
to the single-agent treatment of SMAC mimetics was very
common among cancer patients, posting a serious problem
for the potential clinical application, and calling for novel
strategies to improve SMAC mimeitc-efficacy [10, 18–20].
In the present study, we discover a combination approach
that can be useful in promoting the efficacy of SMAC
mimetic-based breast cancer treatment. This combination
approach is composed of SMAC mimetic Birinapant and
NCTD, a major bioactive constituent of Traditional Chinese
Medicine blister beetle Mylabris. Since Birinapant is a drug
candidate that currently is under clinical evaluation for
human cancer treatment, and NCTD is used clinically as a
conventional anticancer drug, our discovery has important
clinical relevance and warrants further preclinical and

clinical investigations. Moreover, the importance of our
discovery is further underscored by our findings that the
potent anticancer activity was observed in 3 triple-negative
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and AU565 cell lines,
suggesting that this combination strategy might offer a
treatment option for this lethal form of breast cancer.
Mechanistic studies revealed that extrinsic apoptosis
is responsible for the enhancement of Birinapant-mediated

anticancer activity by NCTD in breast cancer cells. We
reached this conclusion by several pieces of evidences.
Firstly, western blotting analysis of apoptosis signaling
showed that as compared to single-agent treatments, the
combination distinctly amplified caspase-8-caspase-3
cascade in cancer cells in both cell lines, which led to
more cleavage of DNA repair enzymes PARP. Secondly,
inhibition of initiator caspase-8 by Z-IETD-FMK

significantly attenuated the cell death induction by the
combination, suggesting an essential role of extrinsic
pathway in the combination-mediated apoptosis. Thirdly,
the strong anticancer activity by combination could be
significantly inhibited by a TNFα-, but not by a TRAILneutralizing antibody, indicating that activation of
apoptosis signaling was triggered by TNFα secreted by
the cancer cells in an autocrine fashion.
C-FLIPL and c-FLIPS are oncoproteins that have
drawn attention in the field of cancer targeted therapy
recently. Increased expression of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS
was recorded in cell lines from breast cancer and many
other cancer cells [15, 21–23]. Another key finding in this
study is that NCTD potently inhibits the expression of two
isoforms of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS in breast cancer cells.
This finding is in agreement with previous observation in
esophageal cancer cells, suggesting that this inhibitory
effect by NCTD is not limited to single cell type. RT-PCR
analysis indicates that the inhibitory effect on c-FLIPL
and c-FLIPS is mediated by a transcriptional mechanism.
Because both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS exhibit the oncogenic
function primarily by inhibiting caspase-8 activation,
our data thus indicate that the inhibition of c-FLIPL and
c-FLIPS may be responsible for enhancement of caspase-8
activation by the combination.

of 10 µL/well in 100 µL culture medium and the samples
were incubated at 37°C for 2–4 hours. The optical density
(OD) of each sample was measured using a microplate
reader at 450 nM. The percentages of absorbance relative
to those of untreated control samples were plotted as a
linear function of drug concentration. Inhibition of cell
viability was measured by percentage of viable cells
relative to the control: % inhibition = 100% × ODT/ODC,
where ODT is the average OD value of the treated
samples and ODC is the average OD value of the control
samples. Combination index (CI) was calculated by an
equation reported in a previous report [24]. CI less than
0.9 indicates synergism; 0.9 to 1.1, additivity; and greater
than 1.1, antagonism.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from cancer cells
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). For
first-strand complementary DNA synthesis, 1 μg total
RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity

Ltd, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For PCR, the primer sequences and expected
product sizes were as follows: c-FLIP (512 bp), forward:

Analysis of apoptosis

Statistical analysis

Apoptosis was examined using Roche Annexin-VFLUOS Staining Kit (Haoran, Shanghai, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Before flow cytometric
analysis, cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 μl
binding buffer, the cell suspension was added to Annexin
V/FITC (5 μl) and homogeneous mixing, 5 μl of Propidium
Iodide (PI) was added to the solution and the samples were
incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Each
sample containing 1–3 × 105 cells were measured using
a BD LSR II system (BD Biosciences) analyzed by the
DiVA software (version 4.1.2; BD Biosciences).

At least three separate experiments were performed.
One-way ANOVA and Student t tests were used to
determine significance between experimental groups. A

For the colony formation assay, 1,000 MDAMB-468 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated
with 20 µM NCTD, 5 µM Birinapant or a combination
of the two for 12 days. The cell colonies were fixed with
methanol for 5 min at room temperature and then stained
with 0.05% crystal violet in 50% methanol and 10%
glacial acetic acid for counting. Colonies with a diameter
> 0.2 mm were counted and the results were presented as a
histogram. Colony formation experiments were performed
in triplicate and repeated in three independent experiments.

Western blotting
Western blotting analyses were performed as
described previously [12]. Antibodies used were as
follows: anti-cFLIP (G-11) mouse monoclonal antibody
(sc-5276); anti-Actin goat polyclonal antibody, HRPconjugated secondary anti-mouse, anti-goat and anti-rabbit
antibodies from Santa from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Shanghai, China); anti-cIAP-1 (AF8181) from R&D
Systems (Shanghai, China); anti-caspase-8 mouse
monoclonal antibody (9746), anti-caspase-3 rabbit
polyclonal antibody (9665) and anti-PARP (9542) from
Cell Signaling Technology.
