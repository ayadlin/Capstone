ABSTRACT
While MDM2 inhibitors hold great promise as cancer therapeutics, drug resistance
will likely limit their efficacy as single agents. To identify drug combinations that
might circumvent resistance, we screened for agents that could synergize with
MDM2 inhibition in the suppression of cell viability. We observed broad and robust
synergy when combining MDM2 antagonists with either MEK or PI3K inhibitors.
Synergy was not limited to cell lines harboring MAPK or PI3K pathway mutations,
nor did it depend on which node of the PI3K axis was targeted. MDM2 inhibitors also
synergized strongly with BH3 mimetics, BCR-ABL antagonists, and HDAC inhibitors.
MDM2 inhibitor-mediated synergy with agents targeting these mechanisms was much
more prevalent than previously appreciated, implying that clinical translation of these
combinations could have far-reaching implications for public health. These findings
highlight the importance of combinatorial drug targeting and provide a framework
for the rational design of MDM2 inhibitor clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

agents are targeted. This form of resistance may reflect a
dependency on more than one signaling axis, or in some
cases overlapping signaling networks, that drive growth
and survival in such tumors.
Each of the above scenarios involves a type of
intrinsic resistance, irrespective of whether the pre-existing
drug insensitivity involves all or just a few cells within
the tumor. Combating such resistance will undoubtedly
require treating patients with drug combinations [1-3].
The goals of such combinations will be 1) to eliminate
rare cells that are resistant to targeted single agents
before they can expand and 2) to simultaneously suppress
cooperatively acting oncogenic driver signals.

genetic alterations have shown clinical promise, in
some cases eliciting remarkable tumor regressions and
accompanying improvements in survival [1]. However,
these therapeutic benefits are rarely durable. Following
initial pharmacologic tumor debulking, rare, pre-existing
subclones of drug-resistant tumor cells typically expand
to repopulate the tumor, often within months of the
initiation of targeted therapy. Still more challenging, many
tumors fail to exhibit even an initial response to such
therapies, despite harboring clonal oncogenic alterations

important drivers of oncogenesis. p53 is a tumor
suppressor and transcription factor that responds to
cellular stress by activating the transcription of numerous
genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence,
and DNA repair [4]. Unlike normal cells, which have
infrequent cause for p53 activation, tumor cells are under
constant cellular stress from various insults including
hypoxia and pro-apoptotic oncogene activation. Thus,
there is a strong selective advantage for inactivation of
the p53 pathway in tumors, and it has been proposed that
eliminating p53 function may be a prerequisite for tumor
survival [5]. In support of this hypothesis, three groups
of investigators have used mouse models to demonstrate
that absence of p53 function is a continuous requirement
for the maintenance of established tumors [6-8]. When
the investigators restored p53 function to tumors with
inactivated p53, the tumors regressed. More recent
preclinical work by two of these groups indicated that this
regression might be specific to higher-grade tumors [9,
10].
p53 is inactivated by mutation and/or loss in
approximately 50% of tumors [11]. Other key members
of the p53 pathway are also genetically or epigenetically
altered in cancer. MDM2, an oncoprotein, inhibits p53
function, and it is activated by gene amplification at high
frequency in sarcomas and at low frequency in cancers of
the brain, bladder, stomach, lung, skin, and breast [11].
MDM2, in turn, is inhibited by another tumor suppressor,
ARF. It has been suggested that alterations downstream of
p53 may be responsible for at least partially inactivating
the p53 pathway in p53WT tumors. In support of this
concept, some p53WT tumors appear to exhibit reduced
apoptotic potential, although their ability to undergo cell
cycle arrest remains intact [12].
The ability to activate p53 in human tumors has
been a long-standing and elusive therapeutic goal,
but significant advances towards this objective have
been made in the last several years [13, 14]. The most
promising treatment strategy identified to date involves
use of small molecules that bind MDM2 and neutralize
its interaction with p53. MDM2 inhibits p53 activity by
three mechanisms: 1) acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to
promote p53 degradation, 2) binding to and blocking the
p53 transcriptional activation domain, and 3) exporting
p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [4]. All three of
these mechanisms can be blocked by neutralizing the
MDM2-p53 interaction. This therapeutic strategy could
potentially be applied to the roughly 50% of tumors that
are p53WT, and preclinical studies with small molecule
MDM2 inhibitors have yielded promising reductions in
tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo [13, 14].
Nonetheless, even in p53WT tumors, single-agent
MDM2 inhibition is unlikely to confer dramatic and
durable inhibition of tumor growth in the majority of
cancer patients. It is clear that MDM2 inhibition can drive
the selective expansion of rare p53-inactivated tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells [8, 15], and additional agents will have to be coadministered to eliminate such cells. Furthermore, both
cultured tumor cells and human tumors show variable
initial responses to MDM2 inhibitors [12, 16-18], and it
will likely be necessary to inhibit other survival signals
to unmask the full apoptotic potential of p53 activation.
Towards the goal of preempting resistance to MDM2
inhibition and eliciting long term disease control, a cellbased screen was conducted to identify compounds that
might synergize with MDM2 inhibitors in the inhibition
of tumor cell viability. Among the top screening hits were
compounds targeting fundamental oncogenic pathways,
including the PI3K and MAPK pathways, thus providing
possible combinations to evaluate in clinical trials.

RESULTS
Combination Screening Revealed Compounds
that Synergize with MDM2 Inhibitors
To identify agents that might synergize with
MDM2 inhibition in the suppression of cell viability,
1169 compounds targeting a diverse array of mechanisms
(Table S1) were screened in pair-wise combinations with
an MDM2 inhibitor called C-25 [19] (Table S2) across ten
cell lines (seven p53WT and three p53Mutant). The p53Mutant
cell lines served as negative controls, as no synergy
would be expected in cell lines that lack the capacity to
respond to single-agent MDM2 inhibition. A combination
was called as a hit in this screen when ≥ 3 of the seven
p53WT cell lines (but none of the three p53Mutant cell
lines) displayed synergy, as determined using the Loewe
additivity model [20]. In total, thirteen of the 1169 library
compounds (1.1%) exhibited synergy with the MDM2
inhibitors (Figure 1). Remarkably, three of the 13 screen
hits were compounds targeting the MAPK and PI3K
pathways (PD0325901, a MEK kinase inhibitor; BEZ235,
a dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor; and MK-2206, an
AKT kinase inhibitor).
To confirm these 3 hits and determine how broadly
these synergies might extend across tumor cell types,
an independent set of 40 cell lines (thirty-six p53WT
and four p53Mutant) was screened with these compounds
(Table S3). Additional compounds targeting the PI3K and
MAPK pathways were also profiled in this screen 1) to
determine whether intervention at other nodes in the PI3K
and MAPK pathways might also synergize with MDM2
inhibition, 2) to dissect the individual roles of PI3K and
mTOR inhibition in the BEZ235-mediated synergy, and
3) to ensure that the synergy conferred by the primary
screening hits targeting the PI3K and MAPK biochemical
axes was pathway-specific, rather than compound-specific
(Table S4). The additional compounds included in this
follow-up screen included a MEK inhibitor (trametinib),

inhibitors (AMG 511 and GDC-0941), and an mTOR
kinase inhibitor (AZD8055). Several striking findings were

identified in this screen (Figure 2). First, combinations of
MDM2 antagonists and PI3K pathway inhibitors exhibited
broad and robust synergy, irrespective of which node in
the PI3K pathway was targeted; furthermore, the synergy

was not limited to cell lines harboring PI3K pathway
mutations (Figure 2A). Similarly, combinations of MDM2
and MEK inhibitors displayed strong and widespread
synergy, independent of MAPK pathway mutational status
(Figure 2B). BRAF inhibitors also synergized with MDM2
inhibitors, and the greatest cooperativity was seen in the
BRAFMutant cell lines (Figure 2B).
A third screen, performed with the clinical-stage
MDM2 inhibitor, AMG 232, confirmed the breadth of
synergy with PI3K and MAPK pathway antagonists and
extended this finding to hematologic tumor cell lines
(Figure S1). This screen was designed and powered
to enable a statistical assessment of synergy for each
compound combination across all cell lines in which it
was tested. All combinations were performed using four
biological replicates, each of which was run in technical
duplicate. A heterologous compound combination (AxB)
was considered synergistic only when its synergy score
was statistically greater than those of both its cognate selfcrosses (AxA and BxB), as determined using a Loewe
additivity model. In the twenty p53WT cell lines tested, 49%
of the AMG 232 x PI3K pathway inhibitor combinations
and 76% of the AMG 232 x MEK inhibitor combinations
exhibited synergy (Figure S1). In the five p53WT cell lines
harboring BRAF mutations, 75% of the AMG 232 x
BRAF inhibitor combinations displayed synergy.

Compound-mediated reductions in cell numbers
could be caused by increased cell death and/or decreased
cell proliferation. We assessed the possible role of each of
these processes in the synergy between MDM2 inhibitors
and PI3K or MAPK pathway antagonists. These studies
measured caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis), sub-G1 DNA
content (death), and BrdU incorporation (proliferation).
Combining MDM2 and PI3K inhibitors in the CAL51 (breast adenocarcinoma) and NCI-H460 (non-small
cell lung cancer) cell lines yielded profound inductions
of apoptosis (Figure 3A-B). The same conclusions were
drawn from combinations of MDM2 and MEK inhibitors
in the RT4 (bladder cancer), RKO (colorectal cancer),
A427 (lung cancer), and C32 (melanoma) cell lines
(Figure 3C-F). Flow cytometry-based sub-G1 cell cycle
analysis of the RKO cell line revealed strong synergistic
cell killing in the MDM2 plus MEK inhibitor combination
(Figure 3G-H). In contrast to the results of the cell death
assays, BrdU incorporation studies showed substantial
single-agent activity with the MDM2 and MEK inhibitors,
but modest cooperativity when combined, suggesting
that apoptosis induction was the dominant factor driving
synergistic reductions in cell numbers (Figure 4).

co-expression of FOXM1 with 96% of these 70 genes
(Figure 5B). As a control, 20 random genes were selected
for FOXM1 co-expression analysis, and none of these
transcripts showed a correlation with FOXM1 expression
(Figure 5B). The data in Figure 5B have also been graphed
as scatterplots for two synergy-associated genes (Figure
5C-D), pointedly illustrating the very tight correlation
between their expression and that of FOXM1. In contrast,
no scatterplot correlation was apparent between the
expression of FOXM1 and a representative randomly
selected gene (Figure 5E).
It has been reported that p53 activation
downregulates FOXM1 expression and that MAPK
pathway inhibition blocks FOXM1 nuclear translocation
[24, 25]. Conversely, p53 gene silencing has been shown
to increase FOXM1 expression [24, 26]. FOXM1 has also
been shown to increase the resistance of cancer cells to
apoptosis, and FOXM1 knockdown re-sensitizes tumor
cells to programmed cell death [27]. Together, our findings
and the published data are consistent with the hypothesis
that MDM2 and MEK inhibition play complementary roles
in the suppression of FOXM1, resulting in synergistic
induction of apoptosis.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms
underlying the observed synergy between MDM2 and
MEK inhibition, we performed a global expression
screen to identify genes whose mRNA levels were altered
when co-targeting MDM2 and MEK. Two cell lines
of different origins, RKO and A427, were selected to
enable tissue-specific expression changes to be filtered
out of the analysis. Each cell line was treated with
DMSO (negative control), a MEK inhibitor, an MDM2
inhibitor, or both. Synergy-associated genes were defined
as those whose expression increased or decreased by
1) 3.75-fold when comparing the combination group to
the DMSO control and 2) 2.2-fold when comparing the
combination group to both single-agent groups. Seventyfour genes (4 upregulated and 70 downregulated) met
both of these criteria in both cell lines (Figure 5A). The
70 downregulated transcripts largely represented genes
associated with cell division, DNA damage and repair,
and apoptosis. Strikingly, 55 of these 70 genes (79%) had
previously been identified as transcriptional targets of
the FOXM1 transcription factor [22, 23], suggesting the
possibility that suppression of FOXM1 activity might play
an important role in the synergy mediated by MDM2 and
MEK inhibition.
To further explore this association, we performed
co-expression analysis comparing mRNA levels
of FOXM1 to those of the 70 synergy-associated
downregulated transcripts in 6466 primary tumor samples
of diverse tissue origins [11]. This analysis revealed strong

In vivo Efficacy Studies Recapitulated the in
vitro Cooperativity Observed with Pair-wise
Combinations of MDM2 Inhibitors and MAPK
Pathway Inhibitors
To assess whether the cooperative actions of MDM2
inhibition and MEK or BRAF inhibition seen in vitro
could be translated to the in vivo setting, these agents
were orally administered in a pair-wise fashion to mice

harboring human RKO colon tumor xenografts (Figure 6).
The RKO model was chosen for this purpose because it
is particularly resistant to single agents targeting these 3
proteins. MDM2, MEK and BRAF inhibitor monotherapy
conferred tumor volume reductions of 24, 51 and 23%,
respectively. But in combination, MDM2 plus BRAF
inhibition (Figure 6A) and MDM2 plus MEK inhibition
(Figure 6B) elicited 89 and 93% decreases in tumor
volume, respectively (p<0.0001 for each combination vs.
its respective single-agent comparators). There were no
adverse effects on body weight in any of the treatment
groups. However, it was not possible to draw conclusions
about MDM2 inhibitor safety from these studies, as this
series of MDM2 antagonists displays very weak activity
against murine MDM2 (data not shown). Definitive safety

assessment awaits evaluation of these combinations in
humans. A second point not addressed by this study is the
durability of response upon withdrawal of therapy. Future
in vivo studies will evaluate this question over extended
observation periods and will involve pair-wise MDM2
inhibitor combinations with MAPK and PI3K antagonists.

Triple Combinations of MDM2, PI3K, and MEK
Inhibitors Produced Greater Reductions in Cell
Numbers than Two-Way Combinations of these
Agents
We next evaluated whether PI3K inhibition and
MEK inhibition might also synergize when combined

with one another. Combining PI3K and MAPK
pathway antagonists yielded synergy in a majority of
the 39 cell lines tested (Figure S2). Synergy was also
observed between PI3K and BRAF antagonists, and this
cooperativity was enriched in BRAF-mutant cell lines
(Figure S2). Together, the above results demonstrated that
all three pair-wise combinations of MDM2, MAPK, and
PI3K pathway inhibitors could elicit broad and robust
synergy across a wide array of tumor cell lines, and they
raised the possibility that triple combinations of agents
targeting these key oncogenic pathways might enhance
therapeutic index (the ratio between the therapeutic dose
and the toxic dose) and evoke durable clinical responses.
As a first step towards this goal, triple combinations
of MDM2, PI3K, and MEK inhibitors were evaluated in
6 cell lines. Each agent was evaluated over a 10-point
exposure-response curve in combination with the other two
agents to create 10 x 10 x 10 cuboidal matrices. Growth
inhibition at each 3-way combination data point in the
cube was then compared to the growth inhibition conferred
by the three 2-way combinations that used the same
compound concentrations as in the triple combination. In
so doing, it was possible to identify regions within each
cube in which the triple combination was statistically
superior to all of its cognate double combinations. To
determine whether these regions might harbor features
common to all 6 cell lines, we developed algorithms to
investigate whether specific ratios of the three agents could
provide universally superior anti-proliferative activity.
Two such MDM2:MEK:PI3K inhibitor molar ratios were
identified (Table S5). These two triple combination ratios
conferred enhanced growth suppression relative to their
three constituent double combination ratios over broad
concentration ranges (Figure 7A-B). While these represent
privileged ratios, there were several additional ratios in
which the 3 compounds mediated statistically greater
growth inhibition than their cognate double combinations
across four or five of the 6 cell lines (7 and 2 instances,
respectively; Table S5). We developed another algorithm
to identify ratios of the 3 agents that maximized growth
suppression irrespective of how the constituent double
combinations performed. Two such combinations were
identified (Table S5), one of which is exemplified in
Figure 7C.
We observed that identical levels of growth
inhibition could be achieved using vastly different
concentration combinations for each of the 3 agents in
a cuboidal matrix. To visualize this, we generated threedimensional isobolograms identifying contours of equal
effect level. Growth inhibition was represented on a
200-percentage-point scale, where 0%, 100%, and 200%
indicate no effect, cell stasis, or complete cell regression,
respectively. Figure 7D shows a sample isobologram
at 150% growth inhibition; the specific ratios shown in
Figures 7A-C have been mapped onto this surface (Figure
7D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The agents used in these experiments target
fundamental signaling pathways that are also important for
the survival and proliferation of non-transformed cells. It
is therefore possible that only a subset of the combinations
in high-effect-level isobolograms would be clinically
tolerable. In the clinic, the flexibility to titrate each agent
in a combination individually would, in principal, afford
the ability to optimize safety for any given efficacy level.
In vitro studies such as these, along with human safety
and efficacy data from single-agent and two-way clinical
combinations, may inform the judicious selection of doses
or dose ratios to evaluate in higher-order combination
clinical trials.

MDM2 Inhibitors Synergized with Agents
Targeting Other Key Neoplastic Pathways and
Processes
Broad and striking synergy was also observed
with other MDM2 inhibitor combinations in our screens.
MDM2 antagonists synergized with the dual Bcl-2/BclxL inhibitors ABT-737 and ABT-263 (navitoclax) across
an array of solid tumor cell lines (Figure S3A-B) and
hematologic cell lines (Figure S3B). In contrast, MDM2
inhibitor synergy with the Bcl-2-selective inhibitor,
ABT-199, was largely confined to hematologic cell lines,
implying that Bcl-xL inhibition is required for synergy
with MDM2 antagonism in most solid tumor cell lines
(Figure S3B).
Imatinib, the first BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor
approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML), was observed to synergize with MDM2
inhibition in two BCR-ABL-positive CML cell lines,
CML-T1 and BV173 (data not shown). Four secondgeneration BCR-ABL inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib,
bosutinib and ponatinib) were also tested alongside
imatinib in the CML-T1 cell line and shown to synergize
with MDM2 antagonism (Figure S4). Remarkably,
dasatinib, which is a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor,
synergized with MDM2 inhibition in numerous solid
tumor cell lines of a variety of tissue origins (Figures 1
and S5), suggesting that its clinical utility may extend
beyond tumors harboring BCR-ABL fusions.
Three histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors,
trichostatin A, panobinostat, and mocetinostat, synergized
with MDM2 inhibition in several cell lines (Figures
1 and S6). Panobinostat is under advanced clinical
investigation (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and was chosen
for mechanistic studies in 3 of the cell lines in which it
showed strong synergy with MDM2 inhibition (A204,
G401, and A2780). As was the case when combining
MDM2 and either MAPK or PI3K pathway inhibitors
(Figure 3), the combination of MDM2 inhibition and
panobinostat produced a much higher apoptotic index than
was conferred by either of the single agents alone (Figure
2038

Oncotarget

S6C-E). And in two of these three cell lines (A204 and
G401), the anti-proliferative effects of the combination
were only marginally greater those of the single agents
(Figure S6F-H), similar to the results seen in the pair-wise
MDM2 inhibitor combinations with MAPK and PI3K
pathway antagonists (Figure 4).

results greatly expand the potential utility of MDM2
inhibitors for treating cancer and imply that clinical
translation of these combinations could have far-reaching
implications for public health.
We paid special attention to the PI3K and MAPK
pathways, given their central roles in oncogenesis
and signal transduction. Pharmacologic intervention
with kinase inhibitors targeting any level of the PI3K
pathway, including PI3K itself, AKT, or mTOR, yielded
quantitatively comparable synergy in combination with
MDM2 inhibition. In addition, we demonstrated synergy
between MEK inhibition and PI3K inhibition that
extended across multiple tumor cell types. Together, these
results establish a synergy triangle involving all three
pair-wise combinations of MDM2, MAPK, and PI3K
pathway inhibitors, and they inspire the hope that triple
combinations of agents targeting these pathways might
produce durable clinical responses across large patient
populations.
It is clear, however, that each of these agents
displays clinical side effects, as might be expected of
inhibitors that target pathways that are fundamental to
the growth and survival of organisms as a whole and not
just their tumors [16-18, 39, 40]. Combining agents will
be necessary to overcome resistance, but it will almost
certainly not be possible to use the highest doses that are
tolerable as single agents. Early clinical results from twoway combinations of PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors
suggest that dual inhibition of these pathways may yield
both greater efficacy and greater toxicity [41, 42], and it
will very likely be necessary to dial back the dose of one
or more of the inhibitors in a triple combination in order
to achieve adequate tolerability. The cell-based isobole
analysis described here, along with an understanding
of each of the single-agent adverse event profiles, may
provide a roadmap for the flexible selection of MDM2,
PI3K, and MAPK pathway inhibitor dose combinations for
clinical hypothesis testing. Two-way clinical combinations
involving MDM2 inhibitors could provide additional data
upon which to design triple combination trials.
Despite the central roles and high frequencies of
PI3K, MAPK, and p53 pathway dysregulation in human
cancer, it is remarkable how little clinical efficacy has
been achieved with single agents targeting each of these
axes [16-18, 39, 40]. With the exception of MAPK
pathway inhibitors in melanoma, these agents have yielded
few clinical responses, even in genetic contexts in which
logic would dictate that they should. BRAF inhibitors
have been largely ineffective in BRAF-mutant colorectal
cancer, MEK inhibitors have had little impact in a variety
of RAS-mutated tumors, and PI3K inhibitors have yielded
disappointing results in tumors harboring alterations
in PTEN and PI3Kα [39, 40]. Rapamycin analogs have
shown efficacy, but only in restricted clinical settings [40].
Clinical data have been reported for only one MDM2
inhibitor thus far, and objective responses have been seen

DISCUSSION
As a first step towards optimizing the clinical utility
of MDM2 inhibitors, we screened an 1169-compound
library for agents that might synergize with MDM2
inhibition in the suppression of tumor cell viability.
Through this in vitro screen, as well as follow-up studies,
we identified several classes of compounds that displayed
synergy with MDM2 antagonists. These included PI3K
pathway inhibitors (targeting PI3K, mTOR, and/or
AKT), MAPK pathway inhibitors (targeting MEK or
BRAF), BH3 mimetics, BCR-ABL kinase antagonists,
and HDAC inhibitors. We explored the mechanism of
action underlying the synergies with PI3K, MEK, and
HDAC inhibitors and discovered a dramatic enhancement
in apoptosis in these MDM2 inhibitor combinations.
Global expression analysis of cell lines treated with an
MDM2 x MEK inhibitor combination yielded a set of 70
downregulated synergy-associated expression changes.
Strikingly, the vast majority of these expression changes
overlapped the FOXM1 transcriptional target signature,
suggesting that FOXM1 was a critical mediator of the
synergy conferred by concurrent modulation of these
two fundamental pathways. Triple combination studies
using MDM2, PI3K, and MEK or BRAF inhibitors
demonstrated that even greater inhibitions of cell growth
could be achieved than those conferred by each of the
three 2-way combinations.
This is the first broad-based, systematic screen
for compounds capable of synergizing with MDM2
antagonism. Some of the synergistic interactions
described in our screens were previously identified
through candidate-based approaches performed in
restricted populations of tumor cell types. For example,
MDM2 inhibition was shown to synergize with: 1) MAPK
pathway inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and
melanoma cells [28-31], 2) PI3K pathway antagonism in
AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [32, 33],
3) HDAC inhibition in AML, lung, and ovarian cells
[34, 35], 4) dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition in AML cells
[36], 5) BCR-ABL kinase inhibition in Philadelphia
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells [37], and 6) dasatinib
in primary B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells [38]. Our
screens revealed that synergy between MDM2 inhibitors
and PI3K pathway inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, BH3
mimetics, HDAC inhibitors, and dasatinib was far more
prevalent than previously appreciated, occurring across
multiple tumor cell types and genetic backgrounds. These

at low frequencies in AML and liposarcoma, but not in
other p53WT solid tumors [16-18].
Why have agents targeting these 3 pathways
failed to produce more substantial clinical benefits?
First, it may be necessary to more fully suppress PI3K
or MAPK signaling or to more fully activate the p53mediated transcriptional program—and to do so for
extended durations—in order to achieve meaningful
single-agent efficacy. However, such high doses and
long durations may not be clinically tolerated, even with
exquisitely selective inhibitors. Optimized ratios, levels,
and scheduling of such drugs in combination may improve
therapeutic index. Second, compensatory feedback
may stimulate alternative signals for tumor growth and
survival, resulting in primary resistance. For example,
crosstalk between the PI3K and MAPK pathways enables
mTOR inhibition to enhance ERK phosphorylation and
MEK inhibition to activate AKT [43, 44], providing a
rationale for dual pharmacologic suppression of these
pathways. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the in
vivo efficacy of such combinations [45-48]. Lastly, these
agents may confer activity that never reaches the clinical
threshold for objective response due to the counteracting
and progressively dominating influence of mutationally
resistant clones. Resistance-conferring genomic alterations
have been documented for each of these 3 pathways [15,
49, 50]. Eliminating resistant clones before they have the
opportunity to expand will be a critical goal of orthogonal
combination therapy.
Full realization of the potential of drug combinations
will require paradigmatic changes in the oncology drug
development process, and this evolution has begun.
While it has been conventional practice to evaluate new
investigational agents as monotherapies or in combination
with approved standard-of-care drugs, the FDA has
begun encouraging industry to co-develop compelling
combinations of two or more new experimental agents
[51]. Many such trials are ongoing, including those
simultaneously targeting the MAPK and PI3K pathways
[41, 42]. Simultaneous targeting is critical, as sequential
administration of anti-cancer therapies has been shown to
foster resistance. Currently, drug development and clinical
practice are centered around sequential lines of therapy,
and a move towards upfront concurrent combinations
would be expected to yield superior efficacy [1, 2].
Additional hurdles exist to the use of combinations
for achieving high-impact therapeutic outcomes. As
mentioned above, a key concern is that increased
antitumor efficacy might be associated with commensurate
increases in toxicity to normal cells, thus leaving the
therapeutic index unchanged and providing no net benefit
to cancer patients. Pathway addiction has been shown to
produce greater loss of viability in tumor cells than normal
cells exposed to individual therapeutic interventions
targeting such pathways. In principle, synergistic drug
combinations targeting more than one such signaling axis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

might further enhance tumor:normal sensitivity, yielding
increased therapeutic indices at tolerable drug levels. This
hypothesis is now being tested clinically, and successes
of this approach will likely incentivize further clinical
exploration of synergistic combinations. Another hurdle
is that drug combinations can be expensive—particularly
those involving targeted therapeutics—and substantially
better clinical benefit will be required to justify these
higher costs. Lastly, tumor biology will dictate which
agents must be combined to achieve durable clinical
responses. This understanding is increasingly driving new
partnerships between pharmaceutical companies with
complementary drug pipelines. While collaborative codevelopment of combinations can present logistical and
commercial challenges, achieving greater therapeutic
success will frequently mandate it.

METHODS
Ethics Statement

RKO and A427 cells were treated with DMSO
(control), 3 μM C-15, 3 μM trametinib, or a combination
of C-15 plus trametinib for 24 hours. DNA-free total RNA
was extracted from RKO (n=5) and A427 (n=3) cells using
the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality
was analyzed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit
(Agilent Technologies) on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies). RNA samples with an RNA
integrity number (RIN) > 8 were considered acceptable.
The concentration of RNA was measured on a NanoDrop
8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). Gene
expression was measured by microarray using single-color
Agilent Human Whole Genome 4x180K v2 custom arrays
(Agilent). Gene expression data were normalized using
the quantile normalization method within ArrayStudio
v6.2.2.30 (OmicSoft).
For FOXM1 co-expression analysis, RNAseq
RPKM values for FOXM1, the 70 down-regulated MDM2/
MEK synergy-associated genes, and 20 randomly selected
genes were obtained from the TCGA for 6466 primary
tumor samples encompassing 20 tumor indications.
Pair-wise linear regression analysis was performed to
determine the strength of association between FOXM1
and each of these genes. Genes were classified as FOXM1coexpressed if their FOXM1 expression correlations (R2
values) were at least 3 standard deviations above the mean
R2 value for the 20 randomly selected genes.
