were based on transplantable tumors (4), wherein in vitro passages
may cause substantial genetic/epigenetic alterations of the tumor
cells, and cell engraftment does not mimic the natural dynamic
interactions among neoplastic cells, stroma, and the immune
response (5). Also, those models may not correctly recapitulate the
mechanisms the tumor develops to escape natural and vaccineinduced T-cell responses (6).
Prostate cancer cells may lose expression of relevant antigens,
acquire defects in antigen presentation, release immunosuppressive substances, block T-cell function favoring apoptosis, and,
finally, promote development and recruitment of regulatory T cells
(Treg) inside tumors and draining lymph nodes (7). The latter
mechanism, especially the role of CD4+CD25+ Treg in cancer, has
been the focus of intense investigation in recent years.
Treg (5–10% of the peripheral CD4+ T cells) are mostly generated
in the thymus and represent an essential mechanism of peripheral
tolerance to self antigens (8). Absence of Treg, which is caused
either genetically or by depletion, favors autoimmunity (9). Treg
suppress not only CD4+ T and natural killer cells but also CTL (10).
Treg can be identified by several cell surface markers, among which
is the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor a-chain CD25. In addition, Treg
selectively express Foxp3, a forkhead/winged helix transcription
factor that controls master genes in Treg development/function (8).
Treg can be also induced in the periphery from naive
CD4+CD25 T cells (11), although it is not yet known whether
they substantially contribute to peripheral tolerance. Conversion of
CD4+CD25 T cells into Treg seems rather common in tumordraining lymph nodes (TDLN; refs. 12–14).
Prostate cancer (15) and other neoplasms associate with Treg
accumulation in the blood and/or in tumors, and this may
inversely correlate with patients’ survival (16), therefore suggesting that Treg promote tumor-immune privilege. It remains to be
elucidated whether their gathering directly affects the tumorspecific immune response. Data in animal models suggest a role
for Treg in tolerance induction against TAA. Indeed, depletion of
Treg before tumor challenge favors induction of tumor-specific
immune responses and tumor eradication (17). Depletion of Treg
also increases the therapeutic index of several cancer treatments
(18, 19). Those models, however, were based on transplantable
tumors.
Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP)
mice express the SV40 large T antigen (Tag) selectively on the
prostate epithelium under the control of the rat probasin regulatory
element, whose expression is influenced by sexual hormones (20).
Hence, male mice remain healthy until puberty. In the following
weeks, TRAMP mice progressively overexpress Tag and invariably
develop spontaneous mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia,
adenocarcinoma, and seminal vesicles, lymph node, and visceral
metastases, therefore resembling human prostate cancer (21). Also,
the immune response against Tag, a surrogate tissue-specific TAA

Abstract

CD4 CD25 Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Treg) are thought to
suppress the natural and vaccine-induced immune response
against tumor-associated antigens (TAA). Here, we show that
Treg accumulate in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes
of aging transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate
(TRAMP) male mice, which spontaneously develop prostate
cancer. TAA overexpression and disease progression associate
also with induction of TAA-specific tolerance. TAA-specific
T cells were found in the lymphoid organs of tumor-bearing
mice. However, they had lost the ability to release IFN-; and
kill relevant targets. Neither in vivo depletion of Treg by PC61
monoclonal antibody followed by repeated vaccinations with
antigen-pulsed dendritic cells nor the combined treatment
with 1-methyl-L-tryptophan inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dyoxigenase, PC61 antibody, and dendritic cell
vaccination restored the TAA-specific immune response. Treg
did not seem to control the early phases of tolerance
induction, as well. Indeed, depletion of Treg, starting at week
6, the age at which TRAMP mice are not yet tolerant, and
prolonged up to week 12, did not avoid tolerance induction. A
similar accumulation of Treg was found in the lymph nodes
draining the site of dendritic cell vaccination both in TRAMP
and wild-type animals. Hence, we conclude that Treg accrual
is a phenomenon common to the sites of an ongoing immune
response, and in TRAMP mice in particular, Treg are
dispensable for induction of tumor-specific tolerance. [Cancer

Introduction
With a population aging rapidly, prostate cancer is one of the
leading causes of death in adult men (1). Indeed, prostatectomy
and radiotherapy are potentially curative for organ-confined
diseases, and treatment of locally advanced and/or metastatic
cancer remains palliative.
Because of the expression of unique tumor-associated antigens
(TAA), prostate cancer is an ideal candidate for immunotherapy.
Vaccination strategies were tested in phase I trials (2), and prostate
cancer was the object of the first randomized phase III vaccine trial
(3). Clinical results were encouraging but far from the prediction
based on animal models. Indeed, many of the preclinical models

antigen in TRAMP mice, has been well characterized in other
models and is dominated by CTL specific for the sequence 404 to
411 (Tag-IV; ref. 22). In TRAMP mice, the immune response against
Tag is characterized by thymic deletion of high-avidity CTL (23),
which allows induction of low-avidity Tag-specific CTL in young
healthy mice, upon vaccination with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells.
Prostate cancer development and progression parallel induction of
a profound state of peripheral tolerance, which cannot be rescued
by dendritic cell vaccination (24).
We investigated whether Treg accumulate in the tumor and
TDLN of TRAMP mice during disease development and whether
they have a role in Tag tolerance.

Materials and Methods
Mice, tumor cell lines, and reagents. Heterozygous C57/BL6 TRAMP
mice and wild-type (WT) mice were housed and bred in a specific
pathogen-free animal facility and treated in accordance with the European
Union guidelines and the approval of the Institutional Ethical Committee.
Animals were typed for Tag expression by PCR-based screening assay.3
Isolation of mouse tail genomic DNA was performed as described (25).
RMA is a H-2b Rauscher virus–induced thymoma (26). B6/K-0 is a kidney
cell line expressing Tag (27). TRAMP-C1 is a prostate cancer, originated
from a TRAMP mouse (28). C26-GM (H-2d) is a colon carcinoma genetically
modified to produce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
Unless specified, all chemical reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, and
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were from BD PharMingen.
Dendritic cell preparation and immunization protocols. Dendritic
cells were prepared and characterized as previously described (29).
Dendritic cells were pulsed with 2 Amol/L Tag-IV (Research Genetics)
peptide for 1 h at 37jC, washed, and suspended at 1  106/mL in PBS.
Dendritic cells (5  105) were injected i.d. into mice.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay. Splenocytes were restimulated in vitro in
the presence of 1 Amol/L Tag-IV peptide. Day 5 blasts were tested for
cytolytic activity in a standard 4 h 51Cr release assay (29). 51Cr release of
target cells alone was always <25% of maximal 51Cr release (target cells
in 0.25 mol/L SDS).
Flow cytometry analyses. PE-labeled Kb/Tag-IV pentamers (ProImmune) were generated using a C411L-substituted synthetic peptide to
enhance binding to H2-Kb (30). Kb/OVA (SIINFEKL) pentamers were used as
negative control. Cells were incubated with the pentamer complex for
30 min at +4jC, and then, without washing, PerCP-Cy-5.5–conjugated antiCD8 and the FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 mAbs were added for additional
15 min at +4jC. Dead cells were excluded by physical variables and/or
by the addition of ToPro-5 (Molecular Probes) immediately before
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. For intracellular cytokine
measurement, day 5 blasts were stimulated in vitro with B6/K-0 or RMA
cells (1:1 ratio) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin and stained
with FITC-labeled anti-CD44, PerCP-Cy 5.5–labeled anti-CD8, and antigenpresenting cells (APC)–labeled anti–IFN-g antibody as previously described
(29). For enumeration of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells, TDLN and collagenase
D–digested prostates were processed on a cell strainer, stained with FITClabeled anti-CD4, PerCP-Cy 5.5–labeled anti-CD8 antibody, and APC-labeled
anti-CD25 (clone PC61), permeabilized, and finally stained with PE-labeled
anti-Foxp3 (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In all
experiments, cells were analyzed on a BD FacsCalibur.
Isolation of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25 cells and in vitro
proliferation assay. CD4+CD25+ T cells were isolated using a Treg isolation
kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The three
cell populations (i.e., unfractionated CD4+ T cells, CD4+CD25+ cells, and
CD4+CD25 cells) were cultured for 72 h in plates previously coated with
5 Ag/mL anti-CD3 mAb. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine by prolifer-

measured. Proliferation index was calculated assigning value of 1 to cpm

In vivo depletion of CD25+ cells and/or blocking of indoleamine 2,3dyoxigenase enzyme. Five hundred micrograms of monoclonal anti-CD25
antibody (clone PC61; American Type Culture Collection) were injected i.p.
into mice at day 4. In selected experiments, treatment was repeated at day
+3 or every 2 weeks. Mice received 1-methyl-tryptophan dissolved in
drinking water at 5 mg/mL as previously reported (31).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Organs were fixed in 4%
formalin for 6 h, then embedded, and included in paraffin wax. H&E
and Tag staining of 5-Am-thick sections were performed as previously
described (24). For foxp3 staining, deparaffinized and rehydrated sections
were immersed in EDTA (pH 9.0) and followed the procedures described in

ref. (24). Slides were incubated with streptavidin 1:1,000 for 30 min,
followed by incubation with 3,3¶-diaminobenizidine tetrahydrochloride
for 5 min, and the counter stain was done with Mayer hematoxylin.
Macroscopic and microscopic specimens were evaluated by a pathologist
in a blind fashion. Histology sections were scored as previously described

(24) with partial modifications: the score of 5 was given to welldifferentiated adenocarcinoma and 6 was given to metastases and/or
neuroendocrine tumors.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s
t test and log-rank test. Comparison of survival curves was considered
statistically significant for P < 0.05.

Results
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg accumulate in prostates and TDLN
of aged TRAMP mice. Firstly, we investigated whether Foxp3+ cells
accumulate in prostates of TRAMP mice. The analysis was initially
conducted in 25-week-old to 27-week-old mice. At this age, TRAMP
mice present a significant enlargement of the urogenital apparatus
(2.5 F 0.9 g; n = 6) when compared with age-matched and sexmatched WT littermates (0.9 F 0.2; n = 6; P < 0.008) and a welldifferentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1A) with penetration of Tag+
cells through the basement membrane of involved acini (Fig. 1B,
black arrows). We also found several Foxp3+ cells infiltrating the
transformed gland and its stroma (Fig. 1C, red arrows), which were
absent in WT prostates (not shown).
Prostate tissues were also processed to single cells and analyzed
by flow cytometry. After gating on viable cells, a small population
of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was found in prostates of both TRAMP
and WT mice (Fig. 2). However, the difference in the percentage of
infiltrating CD8+ T cells between TRAMP and WT mice was
statistically significant (P < 0.001) and reflected the relatively higher
number of CD8+ T cells present in tumor-bearing mice (130.6 F 92
and 7.9 F 2.8  103 cells, respectively; P < 0.022). More than 95% of
the prostate-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were antigen-experienced
CD44+ (not shown). Also CD4+ T cells accumulated in TRAMP
prostates (53 F 18 and 9.9 F 6.2  103 cells, respectively; P < 0.001).
However, the CD4/CD8 ratio was inverted in TRAMP mice when
compared with WT littermates (0.5 F 0.3 and 1.2 F 0.5,
respectively; P < 0.017), therefore suggesting a preferential
recruitment of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells to the tumor site.
Gating on CD4+ cells and analyzing for the expression of CD25
and Foxp3, we found that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells were enriched in
the prostates of tumor-bearing TRAMP mice (Fig. 2C and D). More
strikingly, the absolute number of triple positive cells was 6-fold
higher in TRAMP than in WT prostates (Fig. 2E) and correlated
well with the increase in prostate cell number (16 F 9.2 and 2.5 F
0.6  106, respectively; P < 0.015). Activated effector CD4+ T cells
(i.e., CD25+Foxp3 ) accumulated as well in TRAMP prostates
(7.5 F 3.7% and 3.3 F 2%, respectively; P < 0.04). Hence, prostate
cancer development associated with in situ accumulation of antigenexperienced CD8+ but also CD4+ T cells and CD4+C25+Foxp3+ cells.
To verify whether accumulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells
correlated with age and disease progression, a similar analysis
was conducted on prostate tissue from 6-week-old to 8-week-old
mice, age at which TRAMP mice develop scattered foci of mouse
prostate intraepithelial neoplasia but are not yet tolerant against
Tag (24). Indeed, the macroscopic aspect of TRAMP and WT
prostates (24) and their total cell number did not differ (2.4 F 0.3
and 2.1 F 0.4  106, respectively). In young TRAMP animals, the
number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells was similar to the one found in
prostates of WT mice (Fig. 2E).
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells were enumerated also in para-aortic
TDLN. Whereas TDLN of 6-week-old TRAMP and WT mice were
macroscopically indistinguishable and contained a similar number
of cells (0.4 F 0.1 and 0.5 F 0.2  106, respectively), TDLN of
TRAMP mice ages 25 to 27 weeks were enlarged and contained an

Figure 2. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells accumulate in prostate and TDLN of aged
TRAMP mice. Prostates and TDLN from naive male TRAMP mice and WT
age-matched and sex-matched littermates were processed to single cells. A and
B, prostate cells were stained with mAb against CD4 and CD8 and analyzed by
FACScalibur (FL1-H, fluorescence channel 1; FL3-H, fluorescence channel 3).
The panels depict results from one of six animals per experimental group. The
percentage of positive cells within the regions is indicated. More in details, in
TRAMP and WT prostates, we found 0.76 F 0.2% and 0.33 F 0.1% CD8+ and
0.38 F 0.1% and 0.44 F 0.3% CD4+ T cells, respectively. C and D, the same
cells were also costained with anti-CD25 and anti-Foxp3 mAb. Cells were
gated on CD4+ cells. Percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in TRAMP and WT
mice: 7.1 F 3.4% and 4.5 F 1.0%, respectively. The absolute number of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells was quantified in the prostate (E) and TDLN from
TRAMP (gray columns ) and WT (white columns ) mice at the indicated age
(6–8 wk, n = 5; 25–27 wk, n = 7); bars, SD. Statistical analyses were performed
using the Student’s t test.

increased number of cells when compared with age-matched WT
controls (1.5 F 0.7 and 0.6 F 0.4  106, respectively; P < 0.036).
Moreover, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells were significantly increased only
in TDLN of TRAMP mice ages 25 to 27 weeks (Fig. 2F).
To determine whether the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells accumulating
in aged TRAMP mice were functional Treg, we conducted a
proliferation assay with CD4+ T cells purified from TDLN of
19-week-old TRAMP mice and sorted for CD25 expression. As
measured by [3 H]thymidine incorporation, proliferation of
CD4+CD25 cells increased dramatically when CD4+CD25+ cells
were not present in the culture wells (Fig. 3). As expected (9),
CD4+CD25+ cells did not proliferate. A similar proliferation pattern
was obtained in the cultures of CD4+ cells purified from WT mice,
therefore confirming that CD4+CD25+ Treg from TRAMP mice have
phenotypic and functional characteristic undistinguishable from
WT Treg.
To further investigate whether CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cell accumulation paralleled tolerance induction, groups of young and aged
TRAMP and WT controls were vaccinated with Tag-IV–pulsed
dendritic cells (24) and sacrificed 1 week later. To visualize Tagspecific CD8+ T cells in the spleens of vaccinated mice ex vivo, we
took advantage of Kb/Tag-IV pentamers (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Upon magnetic bead sorting for CD8, a population of
CD8+CD44+Kb/Tag-IV+ cells (2 F 0.5%) was found in the spleens
of 7-week-old vaccinated TRAMP. In vaccinated WT animals, such
population reached 10 F 3.1% and bound Kb/Tag-IV pentamers
with higher avidity (Supplementary Fig. S2). Upon in vitro
restimulation, blasts from both cultures killed an irrelevant target
(RMA) pulsed with Tag-IV, as well as B6-K0 that express Tag (27),
and not or marginally unpulsed RMA (Fig. 4A and B), therefore
demonstrating that those CTL were able to recognize the SV40
epitope as endogenously processed and presented. The lytic activity
correlated well with the percentage of CD8+CD44+IFN-g+ cells as
depicted by intracellular staining (Fig. 4E and F). Indeed, blasts of
age-matched WT mice were much more frequent and, especially,
produced IFN-g at much higher intensity, therefore confirming that,
in TRAMP mice, central tolerance caused loss of high-avidity Tagspecific CTL. As expected from the ex vivo results (Supplementary
Fig. S2), the percentage of Kb/Tag-IV+ cells was much higher in
vaccinated WT mice than in TRAMP mice (Fig. 4I and J).
When blasts from 16-week-old TRAMP mice were analyzed,
neither specific lytic activity nor IFN-g production could be
detected (Fig. 4C and G). Conversely, the lytic activity (Fig. 4B
and D) and cytokine release from 6-week-old and 16-week-old
vaccinated WT mice were comparable (Fig. 4F and H), therefore
confirming that TRAMP mice at 16 weeks of age are fully tolerant
to Tag (24). The consistent finding in tolerant TRAMP mice, both
ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. S2) and upon in vitro restimulation
(Fig. 4K) of a population of unresponsive (Fig. 4C and G) Kb/TagIV+CD8+CD44+ T cells, suggests that a sizable population of Tagspecific T cells survives peripheral deletion and undergoes anergy.
Tolerance cannot be reverted in TRAMP mice by depletion
of CD25+ T cells. To verify whether in vivo depletion of Treg would
rescue Tag-specific tolerance, PC61 or control rat IgG were injected
into TRAMP mice. Four days later, splenocytes were harvested and
costained with anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 mAb. At that time, the
CD4+CD25+ cell population in PC61-treated animals dropped to
<0.5% as depicted by two anti-CD25 mAb, binding different
epitopes on the CD25 molecule (Supplementary Fig. S3). A similar
depletion of CD4+CD25+ cells was found in the blood, and at both
sites, CD4+CD25+ cells remained mostly undetectable for at least

www.aacrjournals.org

Figure 3. In vitro , depletion of CD25+ favors proliferation of naive TDLN CD4+
cells. TDLN from 19-wk-old male TRAMP and WT mice were harvested, and
cells were enriched in CD4+ cells using magnetic beads. The CD4+ purified
population was afterward magnetically sorted for CD25 expression. The three
fractions obtained (gray columns, CD4+ total cells; black columns, CD4+CD25
cells; white columns, CD4+CD25+ cells) were cultured for 72 h in 96-well plates
previously coated with anti-CD3 mAb. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine by
proliferating T cells (triplicate cultures) during the last 16 h of culture was
measured. Proliferation index was calculated assigning value of 1 to cpm
obtained from unstimulated cultures. Data are representative of at least two
independent experiments.

10 days (data not shown). Depletion of Treg was also checked by
Foxp3 staining and flow cytometry in prostates and TDLN of
TRAMP mice treated with PC61 or rat IgG. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4, the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells
dropped, as well, in the organs collected from PC61-treated
animals.
PC61-treated 16-week-old male TRAMP and WT age-matched
littermates were repeatedly vaccinated with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells and killed 1 week after the last boost (week 24). The
urogenital apparatuses of TRAMP mice were enlarged (1.4 F 0.2 g;
n = 6) when compared with the ones from WT littermates (0.7 F
0.1 g; n = 4; P < 0.0001). However, there was no difference with rat
IgG–treated and rat IgG–vaccinated TRAMP mice (1.9 F 0.5; n = 6).
Also, we found no difference in the disease score between the
two groups of treated TRAMP mice (4.3 F 0.5 and 4.4 F 05,
respectively). Finally, treated TRAMP mice were not able to
respond to Tag, as measured both by cytotoxicity (Fig. 5) and
IFN-g release assays (data not shown). Interestingly, in both PC61
and rat IgG–treated and rat IgG–vaccinated TRAMP mice, a
population of Kb/Tag-IV+CD8+CD44+ T cells could be detected,
which accounted for 4.9 F 1.3% and 5.9 F 2.4% of the restimulated
splenocytes, respectively.
In spleens of WT treated mice, we found a strong cytolytic activity
against both B6-K0 and Tag-IV pulsed RMA cells and not against
unpulsed RMA (Fig. 5). Apparently CD25+ cell depletion did not also
affect the antigen-specific immune response of WT mice. Indeed, no
difference in Tag-specific cytolytic activity, antigen-specific IFN-g
release (not shown), and frequency of Kb/Tag-IV+CD8+CD44+ T cells

PC61 or control rat IgG were injected i.p. at days 1 and +3 in WT
C57BL/6 mice, and at day 0, animals were challenged subcutaneously with TRAMP-C1 cells, a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line
(28). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, PC61-treated mice
showed a significant delay (P < 0.026) in tumor growth, therefore
confirming that PC61 treatment is effective against subcutaneous
prostate cancer (32).
An alternative explanation to our findings is that antibody
treatment also depleted activated/effector CD25+ T cells. Using a
similar depletion protocol, concomitant depletion of effectors and
consequent reduction of the antigen-specific immune response has
not been reported thus far (e.g., refs. 17–19). Also, in WT animals,
we found that depletion of CD25+ cells by PC61 treatment did not
impair the immune response induced by Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic
cells (Fig. 5), therefore suggesting that CD25+ effectors were not
altered by PC61 pretreatment. To further address this issue, we
attempted to impair Treg function by cyclophosphamide, which,
at low doses, decreases Treg number and functionality (33) and

could be detected in PC61-vaccinated mice when compared with
rat IgG–vaccinated ones (Fig. 5).
We previously reported that full tolerance against Tag could be
found in TRAMP mice as early as by weeks 10 to 11 (24). Although we
found evidence of Treg accumulation only at later time points, we
hypothesized that failure of PC61 treatment in reverting tolerance
against Tag could be due to a deferred schedule. Hence, PC61
antibodies were injected in TRAMP mice starting at week 6, time at
which TRAMP mice are not tolerant (Fig. 2). To prolong CD25+ T-cell
depletion, PC61 was injected every 2 weeks until week 12, when all
mice were vaccinated with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells and killed
1 week later. Ex vivo analysis of lymphoid organs confirmed a
10-fold reduction of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in PC61-injected
animals when compared with their controls (e.g., TDLN, 9.8 F
0.8% and 0.8 F 0.8%, respectively). However, such treatment did not
break Tag-specific tolerance in TRAMP mice (data not shown).
Those unexpected findings prompted us to verify the antitumor
effects of PC61 mAb in a subcutaneous model of cancer. Hence,

Figure 4. Young TRAMP mice are able to
mount a Tag-specific CTL response, whereas
adult tumor-bearing mice are tolerant to Tag.
Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells were injected once
i.d. into 6-wk-old (A, E, and I ) and 16-wk-old
(C, G, and K ) male TRAMP mice and their WT
age-matched and sex-matched littermates (B, F, J
and D, H, L, respectively). After 7 d, animals were
killed, and their splenocytes were stimulated
in vitro with irradiated B6/K-0 cells and tested
5 d later for cytotoxic activity (measured as
51
Cr release); unpulsed (white squares ) or
Tag-IV–pulsed (black squares ) RMA and B6/K-0
(black circles ) cells were used as targets (A–D ).
E–H, blasts were tested for IFN-g production (upon
stimulation with B6/K-0 or an irrelevant target)
and analyzed by FACScalibur after costaining
with mAb against CD8, CD44, and IFN-g.
Percentage of CD8+IFN-g+ T cells in TRAMP and
WT mice: 6 wk, 9 F 2.5% and 55 F 11%; 16 wk,
0.5 F 0.6% and 42 F 18%, respectively (n = 4).
IFN-g–producing cells in the presence of the
irrelevant target (RMA) were <2% (not shown) and
were subtracted. I–L, cells were also costained
with mAb against CD8, CD44, and Kb/Tag-IV

pentamers gave background values of positive

increases the antitumor effect of dendritic cell vaccines (34). Hence,
100 mg/kg cyclophosphamide were injected i.p. in 16-week-old
TRAMP mice and WT controls 4 days before Tag-IV–pulsed
dendritic cell vaccination. One week after dendritic cell vaccination, the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells dropped significantly in the spleens of both WT and TRAMP mice. Furthermore,
cyclophosphamide treatment increased the immune response
induced by Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. S6), therefore confirming that cyclophosphamide augments the antitumor effect of dendritic cell vaccines (34).
Conversely, no Tag-specific immune response could be detected
in vaccinated TRAMP, either untreated or injected with cyclophosphamide (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The combined treatment with 1-MT, PC61 mAb, and Tag-IV–
pulsed dendritic cells cannot revert tolerance in TRAMP mice.
Indoleamine 2,3-dyoxigenase (IDO), an enzyme that catalyzes the
oxidative breakdown of the essential amino acid tryptophan and,
therefore, blocks T-cell function, accumulates in prostate cancer
tissues (31) and may favor induction of Treg (35). We reasoned that
accumulation of Treg in aged TRAMP mice could be due also to the
Figure 6. Tolerance cannot be reverted in vivo by the association of PC61 with
inhibition of IDO enzyme. TRAMP (A and C ) and WT (B and D ) mice were
injected i.p. with 500 Ag of monoclonal anti-CD25 antibody PC61 (A and B ) at the
age of 6 wk or left untreated (C and D ). The group of mice that received the
antibody was also fed with 1-MT (5 mg/mL in the drinking water, ad libitum until
killing of mice). Administration of PC61 was repeated at weeks 8, 10, and 12.
All mice were vaccinated with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells at week 12 and
killed 1 wk later. Splenocytes were restimulated in vitro and tested 5 d later in

Cr release assays against specific targets, as described in Fig. 3. Each panel
is representative of at least two independent experiments.

release of IDO. Hence, we tested whether treatment with 1-MT, an
IDO inhibitor (31), could synergize with PC61 mAb and dendritic
cell vaccination in restoring the TAA-specific immune response.
In preliminary experiments, we verified that administration of
1-MT was effective in causing tumor growth delay. BALB/c mice
challenged subcutaneously with C26-GM colon carcinoma cells
(36) and fed thereafter with 1-MT in the drinking water showed a
significant delay in tumor growth when compared with control
untreated animals (P < 0.0006; Supplementary Fig. S7).
Hence, PC61 or rat IgG mAb were injected in 6-week-old TRAMP
mice, and animals were fed thereafter with 1-MT. Mice were
repeatedly treated with PC61 mAb at weeks 8, 10, and 12 and
vaccinated once with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells 4 days after the
last injection of PC61 mAb. Animals were killed at week 13, and
their splenocytes were restimulated in vitro. Neither Tag-specific
cytolytic activity (Fig. 6) nor IFN-g production (data not shown)
could be detected in TRAMP mice, irrespective of the treatment.
In WT mice, PC61 treatment in combination with 1-MT did not
increase the immunogenic potential of the vaccine (Fig. 6).
Taken together, our data suggest that Treg, although clearly
accumulating at the tumor site and in the TDLN, do not seem to
have a dominant role in tolerance induction against this TAA.
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg accumulate at the site of an active
immune response. Neither enlargement of lymph node not
draining (NDLN) the prostate gland nor accumulation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in those lymph node could be found
in TRAMP mice at all weeks tested ( from week 6 to week 34;
data not shown), therefore suggesting that accumulation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells was directly related to tumor progression
and local activation of an immune response. A tumor-dependent
activation of the immune response in enlarged TDLN was

Figure 5. Tolerance cannot be reverted by in vivo depletion of CD25+ cells.
Five hundred micrograms of monoclonal anti-CD25 antibody PC61 (A, E, B,
and F ) or control rat IgG (C, G, D, and H ) were injected i.p. at day 4 into
16-wk-old male TRAMP (n = 6; A, E, C, and G) and WT mice (n = 2; B, F, D,
and H ). At day 0, mice were vaccinated with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells.
Animals were boosted at days 7, 21, 35, and 49. Mice were sacrificed at 24 wk
of age (day 56), and splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with irradiated
B6/K-0 cells. Cytotoxicity assay (A–D ) and Kb/Tag-IV pentamer staining (E–H)
were performed as described in Fig. 3.

suggested by the increased population of activated CD4+CD25+
Foxp3 cells only in TDLN from aged and tumor-bearing TRAMP
mice (12.3 F 7  103; n = 6) and not in age-matched WT animals
(3 F 1.3  103; n = 6; P < 0.021) or young TRAMP mice (3.9 F
3.3  103, n = 5).
Hence, we verified whether CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells accumulated
also in lymph node draining the site of vaccination (VDLN). As
found in TDLN, the absolute number of cells in VDLN, from WT
mice vaccinated 1 week before with Tag-IV–pulsed dendritic cells,
increased dramatically from an average of 0.95 F 0.4  106 for a
NDLN to 12.9 F 3.6  106 cells in VDLN (n = 10; P < 0.000002). The
absolute number of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells increased as well,
being only 30 F 16  103 in NDLN and reaching the 299 F 78  103
units in VDLN (P < 0.000006). Curiously enough, also in VDLN, we
found a significant increase in the absolute number and not in the
percentage of Treg, therefore confirming that, during an active
immune response, increase in Treg number in VDLN parallels
increase of other lymph node cell populations, such as total CD4
(3.4 F 1 and 0.3 F 0.1  106 cells in VDLN and NDLN, respectively),
CD8 (2.5 F 0.5 and 0.2 F 0.1  106), and especially Kb/Tag-IV+ cells
(9.5 F 2.5%). Similar results were obtained in vaccinated TRAMP
mice (data not shown).
All together, our data suggest that Treg accumulation at the site
of an active immune response is physiologic and, at least in the
TRAMP model, is not essential for tolerance induction to a TAA.

not mimic the natural development of a tumor mass (37) and likely
causes inflammation at the site of injection (39). This may
dramatically alter the dynamic interactions between tumor and
immune cells (5). Hiura et al. recently reported that both Treg and
antitumor effector T cells were primed in the same TDLN of a
tumor growing subcutaneously. (12). PC61 mAb are usually injected
a few days before or at the time of tumor cell implantation. Such
treatment schedule may give an unrealistic advantage to effector
T cells, likely depleting thymic-derived Treg and preventing the
induction of peripherally induced tumor-specific Treg. Those
models may more closely mimic the condition of a prophylactic
vaccination, wherein PC61 pretreatment increases the immunogenic potential of the vaccine (18), likely recruiting high-avidity
T cells (40) and natural killer cells (17).
However, those tumor transplantation models did not address
the peculiar condition of tumor-bearing subjects, wherein effector
T cells, negatively selected for avidity or exhausted by prolonged
TAA presentation in the draining lymph nodes (41), are at
competition with both thymus-derived and peripherally induced
Treg expanded by conversion of CD4+CD25 lymphocytes (13).
Indeed, when high-avidity tumor-specific T cells were lacking
because of deletion (42), as it occurs in TRAMP mice and most
likely in humans, or when PC61 treatment was began at later time
points since subcutaneous tumor challenge (43), depletion of Treg
by PC61 treatment did not increase vaccine efficacy even against a
subcutaneous tumor.
Tien et al. (32) found increased CD4+CD25+ T cells in the
transgenic model of spontaneous prostate dysplasia 12T-7s LPBTag. PC61 treatment in those mice reduced, but did not prevent,
tumor growth. The different findings obtained in TRAMP and
12T-7s LPB-Tag models may depend on 12T-7s LPB-Tag mice
developing a far less aggressive prostate disease. Indeed, the low
amount of antigen released from prostate cells in 12T-7s LPB-Tag
mice may likely spare prostate-specific T-cell clones from tolerance
induction and favor their activation in conditions of reduced
competition (i.e., depletion of CD25+ cells).
Our experimental settings addressed the role of Treg in a model
of spontaneous prostate cancer development, wherein endogenous
low avidity CD8+ T cells are tolerized during cancer development
and progression. Hence, our data substantially extend, in a model
that more closely resemble the human disease, the observation
made in a more artificial context (44) by Mihalyo et al. (45). Indeed,
PC61 pretreatment did not avoid tolerization also of high-avidity
HA-specific transgenic CD4+ T cells upon adoptive transfer into
TRAMP mice expressing HA in the prostate.
The process of Treg generation and accrual in tumor-bearing
subjects may follow a kinetic common to autoantigens: the
persistence of the Ag; in this case, the TAA would lead to
continuous generation of Treg in the periphery. As suggested (46),
removal of Treg might have only limited or no effect in that
condition, as Treg may be continuously replenished from the
memory pool. In the TRAMP model in particular, tolerance is so
profound that even transient depletion of Treg is not sufficient to
restore TAA-specific immune response. This might occur also in
prostate cancer patients.
Depletion of Treg in vivo has been already attempted in humans
with variable results. Dannull et al. (47) reported that in renal
cancer patients pretreated with the recombinant IL-2 diphteria
toxin conjugate denileukin, Treg were selectively eliminated and a
vaccine-mediated antitumor immunity was enhanced. However,
another group reported no reduction in the number of Treg or their

Discussion
The mechanism by which peripheral tolerance is induced in
tumor-bearing subjects is ill defined (4), although findings in
animal models suggest that TAA drained or carried to the lymph
nodes and presented by APC in a noninflammatory context drive
clonal deletion or anergy (37). Tolerance in 10-week-old to 11-weekold TRAMP mice (24) is likely induced in the absence of local
inflammation because the prostate gland at that time lacks an
inflammatory infiltrate and TDLN are not enlarged (data not
shown). Although several previous findings were consistent with
peripheral deletion of TAA-specific T cells in tumor-bearing
TRAMP mice (24, 38), in those mice, we consistently found a
population of Kb/Tag-IV+CD8+CD44+ T cells, which neither
expanded in culture nor killed or produced IFN-g upon specific
stimulation, therefore implying that a sizable population of Tagspecific T cells survive peripheral deletion and undergo anergy in
tumor-bearing TRAMP mice.
As it occurs in human prostate cancer patients (15), we found
evidence of a progressive accumulation of functional Treg both at
the tumor site and in TDLN of TRAMP mice developing
spontaneous prostate cancer. However, Treg depletion by PC61
mAb followed by repeated vaccinations did not rescue T cells from
anergy. Also, repetitive PC61 injections followed by dendritic cell
vaccination did not break tolerance. Most importantly, the
combined treatments did not modify both the early and advanced
phases of disease progression. We excluded malfunction of the
mAb, because mice that received a single dose of PC61 antibody
showed approximately a 10-fold reduction in the CD4+CD25+ T-cell
population in lymphoid organs. Furthermore, PC61 treatment was
effective against TRAMP-C1 tumors.
As for our TRAMP-C1 model, most of the reports on successful
PC61-mediated depletion of Treg were conducted in mice in which
tumor cells from in vitro established tumor cell lines were injected

presentation by both tumor cells and APC, as well as altered
expression of B7 family molecules by APC, may likely reduce effective
immunosurveillance of prostate cancer (7). Finally, FasL expressed
on tumor cells, together with other proapoptotic mechanisms, may
favor programmed T-cell death at the tumor site (7). Hence, further
studies are warranted to better define tumor immunosuppressive
mechanisms and design more effective and vigorous combinatorial
strategies for generating productive immune responses.

function in melanoma patients receiving denileukin (48). Furthermore, depletion is only transient, and Treg rapidly repopulate the
human body (49).
Other strategies may be implemented to break tolerance in
prostate cancer patients and in TRAMP mice. Also, inhibition of
IDO by 1-MT did not revert tolerance in our transgenic model. On
the other hand, high levels of nitrotyrosines in T cells infiltrating
prostate cancer from humans and TRAMP mice suggested a local
production of peroxynitrites (50). Indeed, in vitro inhibition of
arginase and nitric oxide synthase activity restored T-cell
responsiveness to tumor. It would be interesting to investigate
whether in vivo inhibition of those enzymes may break
Tag-tolerance in TRAMP mice.
In addition to the mechanisms cited above, cytokines, such as
IL-6, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-h, prostaglandins, and
even prostate-specific antigen are all factors that may directly and/
or indirectly impair T-cell function while favoring tumor cell growth
(7). Impairment in tumor antigen expression or its processing and
