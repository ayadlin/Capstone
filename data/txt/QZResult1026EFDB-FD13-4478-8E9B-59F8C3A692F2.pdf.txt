BACKGROUND: The risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in healthy elderly men may depend on extent
of treatment. The authors of this report compared the use of brachytherapy alone with combined brachytherapy,
external-beam radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and androgen-suppression therapy (CMT) in this population. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 764 men aged 65 years with high-risk prostate cancer (T3 or
T4N0M0, prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, and/or Gleason score 8-10) who received either brachytherapy alone
(n ¼ 206) or CMT (n ¼ 558) at the Chicago Prostate Cancer Center or at a 21st Century Oncology facility. Men either
had no history of myocardial infarction (MI) or had a history of MI treated with a stent or surgical intervention. Fine
and Gray regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with PCSM. RESULTS: The median patient
age was 73 years (interquartile range, 70-77 years). After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, 25 men died of prostate
cancer. After adjusting for age and prostate cancer prognostic factors, the risk of PCSM was significantly less
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.68; P ¼ .004) for men who received CMT than for men
who received brachytherapy alone. Other factors that were associated significantly with an increased risk of PCSM
included a Gleason score of 8 to 10 (P ¼ .017). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly men who had high-risk prostate cancer without cardiovascular disease or with surgically corrected cardiovascular disease had a lower risk of PCSM when they
received CMT than when they received brachytherapy alone. These results support aggressive locoregional treatment

The appropriate management of older men who are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer is challenging. Older men
are diagnosed with higher grade and higher stage prostate cancer than younger men1,2 and are less likely to receive curative
therapy for their cancer.3-5 Many older men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer have multiple comorbidities, die
from competing medical causes, and may not benefit from prostate cancer screening and aggressive treatment.6,7 However, for some older men, prostate cancer prematurely takes their life. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of
cancer death among men ages 60 to 79 years and is the third most common cause of cancer death among men aged 80
years.8
It is possible that healthy older men who have relatively long life expectancies may obtain a survival benefit from
aggressive local treatment of high-risk prostate cancer. The benefit of more aggressive local treatment recently was evaluated in a community cohort of men of all ages with high-risk prostate cancer. The data revealed that the use of brachytherapy with supplemental neoadjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and a median of 4 months of androgen-suppression
therapy (AST) (together referred to as combined-modality therapy [CMT]) was associated with a lower risk of prostate

cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when analyses were
adjusted for age and known prostate cancer prognostic
factors.9 Therefore, in the current study, the rate of
PCSM among men aged 65 years who received brachytherapy alone was compared with the rate among men
who received CMT to determine whether more aggressive
treatment decreased PCSM in these otherwise healthy
men of advanced age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population and Treatment
The study cohort comprised 764 men age 65 years without cardiac disease or with corrected cardiac disease and
high-risk prostate cancer who received brachytherapy
alone (n ¼ 206) or CMT (brachytherapy, external-beam
RT to the prostate and seminal vesicles [EBRT], and
AST; n ¼ 558) at the Chicago Prostate Center or at 1 of
20 21st Century Oncology facilities located in Florida,
New York, and North Carolina. All men were treated
between September 1991 and September 2006 and were
followed for a minimum of 1 year. Men who were selected
for study had to have no history of coronary artery disease
(CAD) or myocardial infarction (MI) or, at most, known
CAD that was corrected with a stent or surgical intervention. Men who had a history of MI managed with medical
therapy alone, men with diabetes, and men with congestive heart failure were excluded from the study. Men who
had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were
included if their disease was controlled with medical therapy. High-risk prostate cancer was defined as 2002 American Joint Commission on Cancer10 clinical stage T3a,
T3b, or T4N0M0 disease; or a prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) level >20 ng/mL; or a Gleason score of 8 to 10. A
pathologist with expertise in genitourinary pathology
reviewed prostate needle-biopsy specimens at each center.
The tumor classification T2c was not included in the
high-risk classification for this analysis, because studies
suggest that men who have such cancers have outcomes
similar to those of men who have intermediate-risk prostate cancer.1
Brachytherapy was performed using a peripheral
loading technique, preloaded Iodine-125, Palladium103, or Cesium-131 sources, and preplanned dosimetry.
The prescribed minimum peripheral doses were consistent with accepted standards in the United States. Specifically, the minimum prescribed peripheral doses were 144
grays (Gy), 108 Gy, and 115 Gy for Iodine-125, Palladium-103, and Cesium-131, respectively, when used as

monotherapy and 108 Gy, 90 Gy, and 100 Gy, respectively, when used in conjunction with 45 Gy of supplemental EBRT. EBRT was delivered to the prostate and
seminal vesicles in 25 1.8-Gy fractions using photons,
computerized tomographic (CT)-based simulation, and a
3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated RT
technique. The pelvic lymph nodes were not included in
the EBRT volume. AST consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist with or without an antiandrogen (AA) and was completed before
brachytherapy. The AST doses were consistent with
accepted standards in the United States. Specifically, the
LHRH agonist was either leuprolide acetate delivered
monthly at a dose of 7.5 mg intramuscularly or goserelin
administered monthly at a dose of 3.6 mg subcutaneously.
The AA was either flutamide 250 mg 3 times daily or
casodex 50 mg once daily, both taken orally. The median
duration of AST use was 4 months (interquartile range
[IQR], 2-5.6 months).
At each facility an institutional review board waiver
of consent authorized the collection of deidentified
patient data at baseline and at follow-up visits. A team of
data managers at each facility, overseen by a biostatistician, collected study patient data.
Follow-Up and Determining Cause of Death
Follow-up started on the day of prostate brachytherapy
and concluded on either April 26, 2008 or the date of
death, whichever came first. Patients generally were seen
every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for an additional 4 years, and annually thereafter. Each follow-up
visit included a history and physical examination, including a serum PSA level followed by a digital rectal examination. At the time of PSA failure, a pelvic CT scan or
magnetic resonance image and a bone scan were obtained
in addition to the routine follow-up assessment. Salvage
therapy used in men across all treatment groups was an
LHRH agonist and generally was initiated within 1 year
after PSA recurrence and always before symptomatic or
radiographic progression.
To decrease the potential risk of confounding that
could occur from the unblinded nature of the current
study with regard to initial therapy, the attending oncologist or urologist who followed the patient until death
determined the cause of death. Moreover, to record a
death as caused by prostate cancer, there had to be documented, hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer
and evidence that the PSA level was increasing at the time
of the last follow-up visit despite the use of second-line

Statistical Analysis
Comparison and distribution of patient
characteristics at baseline

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the
clinical characteristics of the study cohort at baseline and
are shown in Table 1 stratified by the treatment received.
A Mantel-Haenszel chi-square metric was used to compare the distributions of baseline patient and tumor characteristics across treatment modalities. For serum PSA
levels and age, medians and their distributions were compared using a Wilcoxon 2-sample test across the treatment
modalities.11
Predictors of prostate cancer-specific mortality

The primary endpoint of this study was PCSM. A
multivariate Fine and Gray regression analysis12 was performed to determine whether there was an independent
association between treatment received (CMT vs brachytherapy alone) and the risk of PCSM after adjustment for
age, Gleason score, tumor (T) classification, and logPSA

2592

(PSA values underwent logarithmic transformation to
achieve a normal distribution, and logPSA values were
used in the multivariate analysis). Gleason score was categorized as 6, 7, or 8 to 10. Tumor classification was
categorized as T1, T2a,b, or T2c to T4. Age was analyzed
as a continuous variable. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs)
for PCSM with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
and P values were calculated for each covariate.
All-cause and cardiovascular mortality

Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed
to determine whether there was a significant association
between the treatment received (CMT vs brachytherapy
alone) and the risk of death from any cause after adjustment for age, Gleason score, T classification, and logPSA.
Multivariate Fine and Gray competing risks regression
analysis was performed on the subset of men with data on
cardiovascular mortality (n ¼ 302) to determine whether
there was a significant association between treatment
received (CMT vs brachytherapy alone) and the risk of
death from any cause after adjustment for age, Gleason
score, T classification, and logPSA. PSA was log transformed to ensure that it followed a normal distribution.

Estimates of prostate cancer-specific mortality

For the purpose of illustration, the cumulative incidence method13 was used to estimate and characterize
mortality after treatment. Time zero was defined as the
last day of treatment, which was the date of prostate
brachytherapy, because EBRT and AST, when given,
were complete by then. Comparisons of these estimates
across cohorts defined by the treatment received were performed using k-sample tests. A 2-sided P value <.05 was
considered statistically significant. R version 2.6.1 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
was used for all calculations pertaining to performing Fine
and Gray regression analyses12 and using the Gray k-sample test.14 SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was
used for all other calculations.

RESULTS
Descriptive Characteristics of the Study
Cohort
Among the 764 men aged 65 years without cardiac disease
or with corrected cardiac disease, 206 received brachytherapy
alone and 558 received CMT. The median age at initiation
of treatment was 73 years (IQR, 70-77 years). Sixty-one percent (n ¼ 466) had a Gleason score of 8 to 10, 43% (n ¼
329) had a PSA level >20, and 19% (n ¼ 147) had T2c,
T3, or T4 disease. Forty percent (n ¼ 307) of the men had
nonpalpable (T1) disease. Compared with the men in the
brachytherapy monotherapy group, the men in the CMT

treatment group were younger (P ¼ .003); a smaller proportion had a PSA level >20, a Gleason score <6, or T1 disease;
and a larger proportion had a diagnosis of hypertension or
hypercholesterolemia (all P < .001) (Table 1).
Predictors of Prostate Cancer-Specific
Mortality
After a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR, 3.0-6.7 years),
25 men died of prostate cancer. After adjusting for age at
diagnosis, T classification, Gleason score, and PSA, the risk
of PCSM was significantly less (AHR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.120.68; P ¼ .004) for men who received CMT compared
with men who received brachytherapy alone despite the
advanced age of the study cohort. A Gleason score of 8 to
10 (AHR, 15.44; 95% CI, 1.64-145.6; P ¼ .017) was associated significantly with an increased risk of PCSM; and a
clinical classification of T2c, T3, or T4 trended toward an
increased risk of PCSM (AHR, 2.64; 95% CI, 0.87-7.97;
P ¼ .085) (Table 2). Age (AHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93-1.16
[per year increase]; P ¼ .47) and higher PSA (AHR, 1.62;
95% CI, 0.84-3.11 [per ng/mL increase]; P ¼ .15) were
not associated with an increased risk of PCSM.
Estimates of Prostate Cancer-Specific
Mortality
PCSM comprised 13% (25 of 188 deaths) of all mortality
for the 764 men in the study cohort. Figure 1 shows that

2593

Original Article

men who received both supplemental AST and EBRT
had a significantly longer time to PCSM (P ¼ .01) compared with men who received brachytherapy alone. Estimates of PCSM 5 years after treatment were 6.7% (95%
CI, 2.7%-10.8%) for men who received brachytherapy
alone and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.6%) for men who
received brachytherapy, EBRT, and AST.
Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality
During follow-up, 188 men died. After adjusting for age
at diagnosis, T classification, Gleason score, and PSA, the
risk of death from all causes was not significantly different
for men who received CMT compared with men who
received brachytherapy alone (AHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.771.54; P ¼ .631). Estimates of death from all causes 5 years
after treatment were 23.6% (95% CI, 17.5%-31.3%) for
men who received brachytherapy alone and 20.4% (95%
CI, 16.6%-24.9%) for men who received brachytherapy,
EBRT, and AST. Competing risks multivariate analysis of
cardiovascular mortality was performed on the subset of
men with available data (n ¼ 302). In the limited analysis,
there was no significant association between cardiovascular mortality and receiving CMT compared with brachytherapy alone (AHR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.08-1.56; P ¼ .17).

DISCUSSION
Despite the advanced age of these healthy men with highrisk prostate cancer, the men who received CMT had a
significantly lower risk of PCSM than men who received
brachytherapy alone. This indicates that healthy older
men may benefit from aggressive locoregional treatment
of high-risk prostate cancer.
Potential life-expectancy gains after curative therapy
for prostate cancer depend on patient comorbidities and
life expectancy.15 Although many older men who are
diagnosed with prostate cancer die of unrelated causes,6,7
select men may live long enough to derive a prostate cancer survival benefit from aggressive curative treatment.
Merrick et al determined that 65% of men aged 75 years
who they treated for prostate cancer remained alive 9 years
after brachytherapy,16 and Blood and Pickles calculated
that the median survival after prostate cancer treatment in
British Columbia was >10 years in men who were up to
age 80 years at the time of treatment.17 Studies support
our finding that curative treatment improves prostate cancer survival in select older men with prostate cancer.5,18,19
Wong et al analyzed men with organ-confined, well
differentiated or moderately differentiated prostate cancer

2594

in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultsMedicare database and observed an association between
curative treatment and longer survival across multiple age
groups, including the subgroup of men ages 75 to 80 years
at diagnosis.5
The findings from this retrospective study are a
report of association; only a randomized controlled trial
would prove causality. Although the current study illustrates that more aggressive treatment for high-risk prostate
cancer is associated with improved prostate cancer-specific
survival, it should not be used to establish the optimal
treatment paradigm. Data support the combination of
AST and dose-escalated RT for men with unfavorable-risk
prostate cancer20,21 and a recently published study on a
larger cohort of men also identified an association between
a lower risk of PCSM and the use of brachytherapy with
supplemental neoadjuvant RT and a median of 4 months
of AST.9 The results of the current study also support the
conclusion that brachytherapy alone is insufficient treatment for healthy older men with high-risk prostate cancer
who are at elevated risk for disease spread to periprostatic
tissue. Future randomized controlled trials should stratify
men by comorbidity to enable assessment of treatment
effects by comorbidity subgroups. Other approaches to the
management of high-risk prostate cancer, including no
active treatment and treatment with AST alone, were not
evaluated in this study. Immediate AST for locally
advanced or asymptomatic, metastatic prostate cancer
delays the onset of local symptoms and metastatic pain
compared with deferred AST.22,23 A randomized trial
determined that immediate AST improved PCSM for
men with nonmetastatic, locally advanced prostate cancer,22 whereas a larger cohort study of men with localized,
poorly differentiated cancer indicated that AST was associated with borderline improvement in PCSM and no
improvement in overall survival.24 Although we observed
that otherwise healthy older men with high-risk prostate
cancer who received CMT had a significantly lower risk of
PCSM than men who received brachytherapy alone,
CMT was not associated with a statistically significant
improvement in overall survival. Equivalent overall survival between the treatment groups did not appear to be
the result of increased cardiovascular morbidity secondary
to the administration of AST in the CMT arm. However,
the cardiovascular mortality analysis may have been underpowered to identify a difference between the treatment
groups, because it was limited to a subset of patients. The
majority of deaths in this healthy older population were
from causes other than prostate cancer.

Risk of PCSM in Healthy Elderly Men/Hoffman et al

We acknowledge that the current study has several
limitations. First, mortality was the only outcome assessed
in our study; we did not evaluate the impact of trimodality
therapy on treatment-related side effects or quality of life.
Second, given the retrospective nature of this study, a prospective definition of PSA recurrence and uniform timing
of salvage androgen suppression were not applied. However, PSA recurrence was defined by community standards, and salvage androgen suppression generally was
initiated within 1 year after PSA recurrence. Third, the
precise reasons why patients and their physicians selected
brachytherapy alone or trimodality therapy are not
known; however, treatment selection reflects community
practice. Finally, there may be unrecognized factors that
were not accounted for in the multivariate analysis that
may influence treatment selection and also may have an
impact on PCSM.
In summary, older men without cardiovascular disease or with surgically corrected cardiovascular disease
and high-risk prostate cancer had a lower risk of dying
from prostate cancer when they received combined
brachytherapy, EBRT, and AST compared with similar
men who received brachytherapy alone, suggesting that
healthy older men may benefit from the aggressive treatment of high-risk prostate cancer.
