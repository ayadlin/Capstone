BACKGROUND: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor with activity against head and neck
cancer and colorectal cancer. Anaphylaxis in response to cetuximab is a significant clinical problem in the Southeastern United States
with a grade 3/4 infusion reaction rate of 14%. Previous retrospective data have suggested that the presence of preformed immunoglobulin E antibodies against galactose-a-1,3-galactose in serum can predict anaphylaxis in response to cetuximab. METHODS: Sixty
patients were prospectively screened as part of the entry criteria for a phase 2 study of neoadjuvant carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and
cetuximab. Patients were recruited at 2 academic medical centers known to have high anaphylaxis rates: the University of North Carolina and Vanderbilt. Only patients with a negative laboratory result were treated on the clinical protocol. RESULTS: No patient experienced anaphylaxis; the negative predictive value was thus 100%. Other than smoking history, the demographics were similar for
assay-positive subjects and assay-negative subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with a negative test result can be safely treated with
cetuximab. Further research is required regarding the optimal cutoff for positivity and the positive predictive value. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Cetuximab is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor. Cetuximab
is composed of the Fv regions of a murine anti–epidermal growth factor receptor antibody with human immunoglobulin
G1 heavy and kappa light chain constant regions.1 The addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy for kRAS wild-type colorectal cancer improves survival. Cetuximab also improves survival for patients with head and neck cancer both when it is
added to chemotherapy for incurable disease and when it is added to curative-intent radiation. The most common side
effects are papulopustular rash and a risk of anaphylaxis.
The label for cetuximab indicates a grade 3/4 infusion reaction rate of 2% to 5%, with most reactions occurring early
in the infusion. The risk of anaphylaxis varies greatly with geography, and severe hypersensitivity reactions are rare in most
of the world. For example, 2 European colorectal studies evaluating cetuximab reported a grade 3/4 reaction rate of
approximately 1%.2,3 In contrast, another colorectal study conducted in Canada and Australia reported a grade 3/4 infusion reaction rate of 4.5% with an any-grade reaction rate of 20.5%.4 Reaction rates are even higher in the Southeastern
United States with an estimated rate of grade 3/4 reactions of 22% and an overall reaction rate of 28%.5,6
An allergic reaction to cetuximab is believed to result from the presence of preformed immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against the galactose-a-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) oligosaccharide present on the Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy
chain.7 Chung et al7 evaluated 76 case subjects treated with cetuximab in the Southeastern United States. Twenty-five
patients had a hypersensitivity reaction, and IgE antibodies against cetuximab were found in the pretreatment samples of
17 of these patients. Among the 51 patients who did not have a hypersensitivity reaction, only 1 had such antibodies. A

case-control study evaluated 559 banked blood samples
and found an odds ratio of 32.8 for severe infusion reactions in patients with preformed antibodies.8 The negative predictive value (NPV) in this study was 0.992; this
means that patients with a negative IgE sample had a
99.2% chance of not experiencing a severe infusion reaction. These results provide strong evidence for the idea
that the presence of preformed alpha-gal–specific IgE
antibodies correlates with infusion reactions. We
hypothesized that assays for these antibodies could be
used to decrease rates of infusion reactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
LCCC1103 (NCT01412229) was an investigatorinitiated, multicenter phase 2 study of induction (neoadjuvant) carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab for
patients with N2b or greater or unresectable head and
neck cancer. Subjects were required to have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or
1, to have not received prior treatment for head and neck
cancer, to have normal bone marrow and organ function,
to not have a peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 1,
to not be pregnant, and to be able to sign an informed
consent form. The study was institutional review board–
approved. Enrollment began in November 2011 and was
completed in April 2015. It was conducted at the University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt, and the University of
Washington. Subjects were treated with cetuximab at a
loading dose of 400 mg/m2 during the first infusion and
then at 250 mg/m2 during subsequent infusions. The first
infusion was given over the course of 120 minutes, and
subsequent infusions were given over the course of 60
minutes. After cetuximab, subjects were treated with nabpaclitaxel (100 mg/m2 over the course of 30 minutes and
then with carboplatin (area under the curve, 2) over the
course of 30 minutes. Premedications were not mandated
because all 3 administered agents are Food and Drug
Administration–approved, but diphenhydramine (50 mg),
an H2 blocker, and dexamethasone (8-20 mg) were recommended before cetuximab. In an attempt to both protect
subjects and prospectively evaluate the NPV of the alphagal assay, subjects residing in the Southeastern United
States were required to have a negative alpha-gal assay to
enter the study. All subjects signed an informed consent
form before any study procedures, including alpha-gal testing. Most subjects were accrued at the University of North
Carolina and Vanderbilt, 2 institutions that had previously
documented high rates of severe infusion reactions to cetuximab.5,6 This analysis concerns 60 subjects screened at these
2 institutions. Patients whose screening was negative were
1698

treated in the study. Patients whose screening was positive
were not allowed to enter the treatment portion of the
study and were treated according to the standard of care;
the study did not follow these patients.
The alpha-gal test was performed at Viracor-IBT in
a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–, College of American Pathologists–, and New York State–
accredited laboratory. It was performed on a Phadi 1000
immunoassay analyzer with a custom ImmunoCAP with
an alpha-gal–containing protein covalently attached. It
was calibrated against total IgE standards from World
Health Organization reference 75/502 to generate results
in kilo units of IgE. This test has not been cleared or
approved for diagnostic use by the US Food and Drug
Administration. A cutoff of 0.35 kU/L was used to define
alpha-gal positivity. Results were typically returned within
several days; in no case did their return require more than
1 week.
The NPV was defined as the proportion of subjects
with negative alpha-gal results who did not experience anaphylaxis (a grade 3/4 infusion reaction according to
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) in response to cetuximab. The positive predictive
value (PPV) could not be ascertained because subjects
with positive alpha-gal results were excluded from treatment in the study and were not followed for subsequent
treatment with cetuximab. Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively, between the alpha-gal–
positive subjects and the alpha-gal–negative subjects.
A never smoker was defined as a patient who had
smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in his lifetime. A former
smoker was defined as a patient who had smoked at least
100 cigarettes in his lifetime but was no longer smoking.
A current smoker was defined as a patient who was smoking at the time of study enrollment.
RESULTS
Of the 60 patients screened for this study, 23 (38.3%;
95% confidence interval, 26.0%-51.8%) were excluded
because of alpha-gal positivity. The remaining 37 patients
(61.7%) went on to receive induction (neoadjuvant) carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and cetuximab.
The distributions of alpha-gal results are shown in
Figure 1. Among those who were negative (n 5 37), 32
(86%) had a result < 0.10, the lower limit of detection for
the test, and the remaining 5 negative values were 0.11,
0.15, 0.23, 0.23, and 0.23. For 6 of the 23 patients with
positive test results, the values were less than 1; for 8
patients, the values were between 1 and 10; and for 7

patients, the values were between 11 and 30. The 2 largest
values were 38.7 and 44.2. Alternative representations of
these data in the form of a kernel density plot and a table
can be found in Supporting Figure 1 and Supporting
Table 1, respectively (see online supporting information).
The demographics of the patients and the differences in the demographics by alpha-gal positivity are shown
in Table 1. The only variable that showed a trend toward
an association with a positive alpha-gal result was the
smoking status. As the smoking status increased, the percentage of patients who were alpha-gal–positive also
increased (never, 21%; former, 37%; current, 59%;
P 5 .07).
None of the 37 patients who were alpha-gal–
negative and received treatment in our study experienced
anaphylaxis. The 95% confidence interval for this NPV of
100%, based on the sample size of 37, was 90.5% to
100%.

DISCUSSION
All humans have immunoglobulin G antibodies against
alpha-gal, but the titer varies. Chung et al7 demonstrated
that individuals with severe allergic reactions have preexisting high-titer antibodies. This higher titer likely results
from prior exposure to similar antigens. In the Southeastern United States, exposure to the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) has been shown to be related to a high
titer.9 As the territory of the lone star tick expands,10 the

region at high risk for cetuximab anaphylaxis could potentially expand with it.
The NPV of the alpha-gal assay was perfect for the
37 subjects treated in LCCC1103. Although 37 subjects
may seem to be a small sample, it is worth noting that the
grade 3/4 rate in this region has been repeatedly noted to
be consistent over time at 14% to 22%.5,6 The probability
of 37 unselected subjects in this region being anaphylaxisfree is, therefore, 0.8637 or 0.0038 (if the 22% rate were
used, it would be 0.7837 or 0.0001017). The power calculations used to design this study were based on the primary endpoint of the clinical study, not the alpha-gal
assay. However, if we were to calculate the sample size
needed for a 1-sample test comparing a null hypothesized
rate of 14% with an alternative hypothesis rate of 0%, we
would need only 25 patients if we assumed an exact binomial test with a 2-sided significance level of .05 and 80%
power. Therefore, the study was well powered to evaluate
the NPV of the alpha-gal assay. Furthermore, these results
are consistent with a retrospective matched-control and
cohort evaluation of a similar assay11 in which the NPV
was 0.962. Because subjects screened with alpha-gal for
this study who had a positive alpha-gal result were not
treated with cetuximab, no conclusions can be made
regarding the PPV of the assay. However, it is notable that
23 of the 60 subjects (38.3%) screened in the Southeast
screened out because of positive alpha-gal results. When
these results are compared with the consistent 14% to
22% anaphylaxis rate at the University of North Carolina
and Vanderbilt,5,6 they suggest that the PPV is likely
poor. This hypothesis is supported by the aforementioned
retrospective matched-control and cohort evaluation in
which the PPV was 0.577. Notably, we used a strict cutoff
of <0.35 kU/L; it is possible that a more permissive cutoff
might retain an excellent NPV while improving the PPV.
Future research should prospectively study patients with
alpha-gal results  0.35 kU/L.
From a practical perspective, many clinicians in
high-risk areas such as the Southeastern United States
have abandoned the use of cetuximab. In colorectal cancer, the harm from this is likely small because the fully
humanized epidermal growth factor receptor antibody,
panitumumab, is available as an alternative.12 However,
in head and neck cancer, there is no such alternative.13 If a
laboratory test can demonstrate patients at low risk for anaphylaxis, then a greater number of patients could safely
receive cetuximab, and this would thus restore an important therapeutic option. In previous retrospective work,11
the PPV was low. In this study, the screen-out rate was
more than 50% higher than the known anaphylaxis rate.

In this context, the significance of a positive result is less
obvious and may reflect a high rate of false positivity.
Unfortunately, no data on the subsequent treatment of
alpha-gal–positive patients were collected to ascertain
whether any had been treated with cetuximab. Therefore,
neither the data presented herein nor other available data
define the optimal management of the patient with a positive alpha-gal result. Clinical decision making for individual patients must balance concerns regarding a
hypersensitivity reaction against the potential benefits of
cetuximab. We suggest that in clinical practice, when a
patient with positive alpha-gal results is treated with cetuximab, the patient be carefully monitored during the beginning of the first infusion. For example, the current policy at
the University of North Carolina is for 1:1 observation by
an MD, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner during
the beginning of the first treatment with cetuximab; such a
policy could be narrowed to only patients with a positive
1700

alpha-gal result. Other work has shown that the routine use
of steroid premedication can lower the risk of anaphylaxis6
and that desensitization is possible.14
The use of this assay could also have a positive economic impact. Previous research has shown cost savings
with the use of a test dose in areas at high risk for anaphylaxis.15 The use of the alpha-gal assay could triage the use of
1:1 monitoring and test doses. If the results are confirmed,
patients with negative alpha-gal results could simply be
treated; this would spare the expense of 1:1 monitoring or
the division of the dose into the test dose and the remaining
dose. In contrast, patients with a positive alpha-gal result
could receive a test dose under carefully monitored conditions. Anaphylaxis is never pleasant, but for some patients,
such as those with poor airways (common in the head and
neck cancer population) and those with cardiovascular disease, the potential health consequences and thus economic
consequences are particularly dire. When such patients

choose to avoid cetuximab, additional suffering and
expense may be spared.
The data presented herein demonstrate a high NPV
of alpha-gal for cetuximab hypersensitivity but are not
sufficient to mandate alpha-gal testing as the standard of
care. This study used a stringent cutoff, but the authors
recognize that the optimal cutoff is not known. Future
prospective research, including investigations of other demographic and laboratory findings and cutoffs, should
focus on ways to improve the PPV of the assay.
