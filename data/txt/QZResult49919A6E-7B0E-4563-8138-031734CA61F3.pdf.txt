ABSTRACT
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial malignancy usually associated
with overexpression of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and β-catenin.
FM807 is a novel curcumin analogue with antitumor activity against both poorly and
well-differentiated NPC cell lines as well as good selectivity for tumor cells. FM807
actions were shown to include inhibition of cell growth, induction of necrotic/late
apoptotic cell death, and G1 arrest in NPC cells. Crucially, it exhibited potent antitumor
effects both in vitro and in vivo. Binding of FM807 to the N-terminus of Hsp90 disrupted
Hsp90/client complexes, resulting in degradation of the Hsp90 client protein EGFR
and inhibition of the downstream Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway. FM807 also
depleted levels of the intranuclear transcription factors β-catenin, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc
levels by inhibiting Hsp90 chaperoned nuclear transport. In conjunction with its low
toxicity in NPC xenograft mice, these results provide a sound preclinical basis for
further development of FM807 as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of NPC.

INTRODUCTION

factor receptor (EGFR), AKT, C-Raf (also called Raf-1),
Cdk4, Bcr-Abl, and p53, are essential for tumor growth,
proliferation and survival [5–7]. The Hsp90 inhibitor
AT13387 could inhibit NPC C666-1 cell growth and
induced cellular senescence with the downregulation of
multiple Hsp90 client oncoproteins EGFR, AKT, CDK4,
and significantly suppressed tumor formation in C666-1
NPC xenografts [8]. Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 combined
with erlotimib could also overcome the EGFR mutant
with acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs)  [9]. The classical Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG
could also downregulated mutant EGFR expression and
sensitized EGFR mutant tumors [10]. Therefore, inhibition
of the Hsp90 machinery is considered to be a potent
strategy in NPC therapies.
Curcumin (Cur), a polyphenol derived from the
herb Curcuma longa, has been extensively studied as
chemopreventive agent ascribed to the modulation
of signal-transduction pathways associated with cell
proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis [11]. Cur has
been reported to down-regulate some clients of Hsp90,

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant
tumor arising from the epithelia cells of the nasopharynx.
High rates of NPC occur in Southeast Asia, especially
southern China, with significant racial and regional
distribution characteristics [1]. As early symptoms are
not obvious, 60–70% of patients with NPC are not
diagnosed until the disease reaches an advanced stage [2].
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the standard methods
for NPC, and their clinical outcome have been greatly
improved since the applications of intensity modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) [3]. Although several trials reported
very encouraging results with locoregional control
rate over 90%, clinicians are still puzzled by the local
recurrence and/or distant metastasis as the major pattern
of disease failure [4].
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a highly conserved
molecular chaperon involved in the maturation and
stabilization of over 200 oncogenic client proteins [5].
Most Hsp90 client proteins, such as epidermal growth

such as BCR-ABL, AKT, EGFR, and dissociate the Hsp90
co-chaperone p23, suggesting an inhibition of Hsp90
function [12, 13]. Despite its poor bioavailability in vivo,
Cur remains a good lead compound [14], as hundreds of
curcumin derivatives have been reported to show lead-like
properties and proving to be more active recently [15–18].
Therefore, a series of curcumin derivatives have been
synthesized in our lab, and tested for their anti-tumor
activies by dozens of cancer cells [19, 20]. We
incorporated a 2-hydroxy-benzoic acid chain into Cur and
synthesized a novel Cur analogue FM807 (2-hydroxy-,
4-[(1E, 6E)- 7-(4-hydroxy -3-methoxyphenyl)- 3,5-dioxo
-1,6-heptadien-1-yl]- 2-methoxyphenyl ester), which
retains the β-diketone structure and exhibits better
anti-infalmmatory activity than that of Cur [21]. In
the present work, we showed that FM807 inhibited the
proliferation and induced G1 arrest in well-differentiated
CNE1 and poorly-differentiated CNE2 cells in vitro,
and exhibited antitumor activity in CNE2 xenograft
in vivo. We demonstrated that FM807 physically bound
to N-terminus of Hsp90 and inhibited Hsp90 function by
affecting ATP-binding activity of Hsp90, leading to the
degradation of Hsp90 client proteins including EGFR
and downstream Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signal
pathways. Moreover, subcellular fractionation of NPC
cells provided information that differentially abundant
intranuclear transcription factors such as β-cantenin
would likely cause various chemosensitivity to CNE1 and
CNE2, and the molecular chaperone function of Hsp90
for nuclear transport could also be inhibited by FM807.
These data suggest that FM807 is a potent Hsp90 inhibitor
against nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.

human normal epithelial cell line Rhek (Figure 1C, 1c).
Although colony formation ability of non-malignant cells
was lower than that of tumor cells, FM807 (10 µM) had no
effect on Rhek colony formation (P > 0.05).

FM807 induces CNE1 and CNE2 cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis
We next assessed the effectiveness of FM807
on inducting cell death in both CNE1 and CNE2 cells.
Cells from both lines were treated with FM807 for 24 h
and analyzed for apoptotic cell death using the FITC:
Annexin-V Apoptosis Detection Kit I. Results showed a
dose-dependent induction of apoptosis that had an obvious
necrotic/late apoptotic cell death in FM807-treated cells
(Figure 2A, P < 0.05). Western blot analysis showed
that anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) exhibited
similar reductions, which were accompanied by increases
in the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and cleaved
caspase-3) (Figure 2B), suggesting that the induction of
apoptosis is one of the major anti-tumor mechanisms of
FM807 in CNE1 and CNE2 cells.
When compared to vehicle-treated controls, FM807treated cells displayed showed marked G1 phase arrest
after 24 h of treatment. The increase in the G1 phase
cell population induced by FM807 was accompanied by
a concomitant decrease in cells in S and G2/M phases.
Moreover, FM807-treated cells were more remarkable at
inducing G1 arrest (Figure 2C, P < 0.05).We next turned to
western blot analysis to further investigate the molecular
mechanisms involved in FM807-induced cell cycle arrest
of CNE1 and CNE2 cells. CDK2, Cyclin A and Cyclin
E showed no significant change with FM807 exposure.
Since the induction of the cell cycle regulator CDK4 and
its cognate cyclin, Cyclin D1, by mitogenic signals is a
critical event in the G1/S transition [25], the observed G1
arrest was consistent with down-regulation of Cyclin D1
and CDK4 (Figure 2D).

RESULTS
FM807 inhibits proliferation of NPC cell lines
FM807 was synthesized as a derivative of Cur
(Figure 1A). To evaluate its effectiveness on cellular
proliferation, Cur and FM807 were administrated to the
NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE2 for 72 h, and subjected
to an MTS assay (Figure 1B). The IC50 values of Cur
and FM807 were determined to be 37.01 and 25.75 µM
for CNE1, 15.33 and 3.59µM for CNE2, respectively.
These indicated that the inhibitory action both Cur and
its analogue FM807 on the poorly-dfferentiated NPC cell
line CNE2 was stronger than on the well-differentiated
CNE1, moreover FM807 was more potent than Cur.
To confirm these findings, we next performed a colony
formation assay to test effectiveness of Cur and FM807
on cell proliferation (Figure 1C 1a and 1b). These data
also revealed that CNE2 cells were more sensitive to their
effects. Importantly, FM807 displayed greater inhibition of
cell proliferation than Cur in NPC cell lines.
To gain further insight into the efficacy of FM807,
we next performed colony formation assays using the

FM807 blocks EGFR-mediated downstream
signaling pathways
Aberrant EGFR overexpression is frequently
observed in NPC, and is associated with tumor metastasis,
recurrence, and poor survival in NPC patients [26–28].
Binding of the EGF ligand to the extracellular domain of
EGFR activates the receptor and its downstream signaling
pathways, ultimately activating or modulating various
cellular processes [29]. Therefore, targeting EGFR has been
suggested as a potent strategy for NPC therapy [30, 31].
To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms
behind FM807, we tested the effect of FM807 on
activation of EGFR as well as the downstream Raf/
MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in EGF-stimulated
and unstimulated CNE1 and CNE2 cells (Figure 3A
and 3B). As expected, EGF activated EGFR as well as
15365

the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways (see in
lane 2). However, FM807 reduced levels of EGFR, C-Raf
(also called Raf-1), and AKT in both unstimulated and
EGF-stimulated CNE1 and CNE2 cells treated with
increasing FM807 concentrations. Their phosphorylated
forms also decreased in a similar manner by the growing
dose of FM807. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
revealed that FM807 did not block transcription of EGFR,
C-Raf or AKT (Figure 3C) in either cell line, indicating
that the degradation was occurring at the level of proteinprotein interaction.
Finally, the degradation was completely blocked
with treatment of the proteasome inhibitor MG132,

indicating that the proteasomal system was responsible for
FM807-induced protein degradation (Figure 3D).

Antitumor activity of FM807 in xenograft
models in vivo
We next turned to CNE1 and CNE2 xenograft
models to assess the antitumor effects of FM807 in vivo.
Nude mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 107
CNE1 or CNE2 cells. After injection, tumor-bearing mice
were randomly assigned to one of three experimental
groups (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg FM807, i.g.) or vehicle
control group. FM807 inhibited tumor growth in CNE1

and CNE2 xenograft models in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4A and 4C). When compared with the vehicle
group, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg FM807 treatment decreased
tumor growth by 19.1% (P = 0.009), 30.3% (P = 0.007),
and 42.9% (P = 0.006), respectively, in the CNE1
xenograft model (Figure 4A). Similarly, 50, 100 and 200
mg/kg FM807 treatment decreased tumor growth by 22.5%
(P = 0.008), 35.1% (P = 0.005) and 53.3% (P = 0.006)
in the CNE2 xenograft model (Figure 4C). All animals in
the treatment groups survived without appreciable weight
loss during the experiment (P > 0.05) (Figure 4B and 4D).
Later histological analysis of lung, liver, heart, and kidney
tissue obtained from treated mice showed no abnormalities
after drug treatment (data not shown).
As shown by immunohistochemical and western
blot analyses, FM807 induced a significant decrease in
EGFR as well as inhibited downstream Raf/MEK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT pathways in CNE2-derived tumors.
Importantly, FM807 was able to induce EGFR, C-Raf
and AKT degradation (Figure 4E and 4F). Western blot
analysis of tumor tissues also showed that total EGFR,

C-Raf, AKT and their phosphorylated forms were
significantly decreased in all FM807-treated groups
(Figure 4F). These data were consistent with the results
obtained at the cellular level and confirmed the antitumor
effect of FM807 in targeting EGFR and the downstream
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.

FM807 physically binds to the N-terminal of
Hsp90 and blocks Hsp90 ATPase activity in vitro
Previous work done by our lab has shown that
Cur degrades Hsp90 client proteins, thereby suggesting
that it is an Hsp90 inhibitor [12]. Moreover, EGFR,
C-Raf and AKT are all key client proteins of Hsp90 and
highly susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition [7].Thus, we next
examined the effect of FM807 on Hsp90. First, we created
the FM807-loaded resins [22], and incubated with CNE2
cell lysate. To this, the lysate and resin were incubated
with one of the following: (1) histidine-tagged full-length,
(2) N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD)
(25 kDa), (3) the middle domain (MD) (40 kDa) or

analysis. (B) CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with increasing doses of FM807 for 24 h, and apoptosis signal proteins were detected

iodide for 10 min, and analyzed with flow cytometry. (D) CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with increasing doses of FM807 for 24 h, and

(4) C-terminal dimerization domain (CDD) (15 kDa)
of yeast Hsp90. This affinity-based screen showed that
FM807 bound to NBD of Hsp90, but not to MD or CDD
(Figure 5A).
We then used Molsoft ICM 3.5a to model the
interaction between Hsp90 (Protein Data Bank ID 2CCS)
and FM807. As shown in Figure 5B, the side chain of
ASN51, LYS58, GLy97 and THR184 could potentially
form four hydrogen bonding interactions with the NBD of
Hsp90 (Figure 5B).
Since the chaperone function of Hsp90 is dependent
on ATP binding, and ASN51 and GLY97 are both involved
in the ATP binding sites of Hsp90 [32], we next tested
the influence of FM807 on the ATPase activity of Hsp90.
Our colorimetric assay for inorganic phosphates revealed
that FM807 could inhibit the ATPase activity of Hsp90
in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, the
inhibition of FM807 on Hsp90 ATPase was greater than
that of Cur (Figure 5C).
Hsp90 requires a series of co-chaperones such as
cell division cycle protein 37 (Cdc37), Hsp70 and p23 to
form a super-chaperone complex. This complex is then
released at various time points to regulate the folding,
assembly and maturation of Hsp90 client proteins [33].

Given this, we sought to further investigate the influence
of FM807 on the interactions between Hsp90 and its cochaperones using CNE1 and CNE2 cells. Hsp90, Cdc37
and p23 levels all showed no distinct changes as a function
of increasing FM807 concentration. However, Hsp70 is a
mark of Hsp90 inhibition, and was increased by treatment
after FM807 treatment (Figure 5D). Furthermore, after
depletion of Hsp90 protein by siRNA, FM807 was unable
to induce EGFR, C-Raf and AKT protein degradation,
suggest that Hsp90 protein is a direct target of FM807
(Figure 5E).

FM807 suppresses nuclear β-catenin signaling
pathway
The data showing a greater sensitivity of CNE2 to
FM807 than CNE1 were both interesting and unexpected.
We next wonder: Is there differential Hsp90 clients
expression that underlies the difference in FM807
chemosensitivity between CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines?
To answer this question, we used western blot analysis
to determine protein levels of EGFR, C-Raf and AKT of
CNE1 and CNE2 cells. Counter to our hypothesis, the
result showed that there were no significant differences of

stimulated with 50 ng/mL EGF for 30 min, and then treated with FM807 for 24 h. The levels of the phosphorylation forms of EGFR

EGFR, C-Raf and AKT protein levels between CNE1 and
CNE2 (Figure 6A). This finding indicating that EGFR and
its downstream signaling might not be the reason for the
observed differences in chemosensitivity.
It has been reported that CNE1 is more radioresistant
than CNE2, and that the transcriptional activity of
β-catenin is closely associated with radiation resistance in
cancer progenitor and stem cells [34, 35]. β-catenin is the
key mediator of canonical signaling in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway, and a hallmark of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
activation is the stabilization and nuclear translocation of
cytoplasmic β-catenin [36]. Intranuclear β-catenin then
interacts with numerous downstream proliferation signals,
including c-Myc and Cyclin D1 [37].
Western blot analysis was used to determine
cytoplasmic and nuclear protein levels in both CNE1 and

CNE2 (Figure 6B). Although there were no significant
differences in cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin, Cyclin D1 or
c-Myc between CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines, results showed
significantly higher nuclear expression of β-catenin, Cyclin
D1 or c-Myc in CNE1 cells relative to CNE2 cells. We next
determined the effect of FM807 on the nuclear transcription
factors in CNE1 and CNE2 cells. Additional western blot
analysis further confirmed decreases of nuclear β-catenin,
CyclinD1 and c-Myc in both CNE1 and CNE2 cells following
FM807 treatment (Figure 6C). Therefore, the differences in
FM807 sensitivity between CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines might
be associated with intranuclear protein expression. However,
the exact relationship between FM807 chemosensitivity and
nuclear transcription factor levels still remains unclear.
It has been reported that Hsp90 is an essential
molecular chaperone for nuclear transport, and Hsp90

could modulate both β-catenin and its phosphorylation
levels [38]. Given this, β-catenin might be a client of
Hsp90 [39], therefore meaning that FM807-induced
depletion of these nuclear transcription factors would
likely operate through Hsp90 inhibition. To confirm this,
co-immunoprecipiation experiments were performed
with an anti-Hsp90 antibody in both cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions isolated from CNE2 cells (Figure 6D).
Results showed that nuclear β-catenin was successfully
detected in the Hsp90 co-immunoprecipitation,
indicating that β-catenin might be chaperoned by Hsp90.
Reverse immunoprecipiation of β-catenin confirmed
coimunoprecipiation of Hsp90 (Figure 6E). Nuclear
Cyclin D1 and c-Myc bands were also visible in both the
Hsp90 and β-catenin immunoprecipitation, demonstrating
the interaction between β-catenin, CyclinD1 and c-Myc
(Figure 6D and 6E). To further clarify the interaction
between Hsp90 and nuclear β-catenin, we downregulated
Hsp90 expression in CNE2 using Hsp90 siRNA

transfection (Figure 6F). Results showed that FM807 was
unable to deplete nuclear β-catenin, CyclinD1 or c-Myc
protein levels after Hsp90 knockdown, suggesting that
FM807 likely reduces the nuclear translocation of these
proteins by inhibiting Hsp90 chaperone functioning.

DISCUSSION
Hsp90 is a highly conserved and abundant molecular
chaperone found in all eukaryotes [7]. Hsp90 is required
for proper folding and maturation of most oncogenic
proteins which can then aberrantly activate multiple
signaling pathways [40–42]. Therefore, the molecular
chaperone Hsp90 is an attractive target for cancer therapy.
In the present study, we have shown that the
Curcumin analogue FM807, has better anti-proliferative
abilities than Curcumin (Figure 1B and 1C), has both
in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects in NPC cells, and
displays selective inhibition of proliferation in non-

malignant cells and two NPC cell lines. We have also
shown that FM807 is an Hsp90 inhibitor that directly
binds to the N-terminus of Hsp90 (Figure 5A and 5B) and
interrupts Hsp90/client complexes (Figure 5E). Inhibition
of cell growth and induction of necrotic/late apoptotic
cell death and G1 phase arrest (Figure 2) by FM807 was
also shown in both well-differentiated CNE1 and poorlydifferentiated CNE2 cells.
Overexpression of EGFR, one of the most sensitive
Hsp90 client proteins, has been reported in 85% of NPC
tissues and is associated with poorer patient prognosis
[43–45]. EGFR is the tyrosine kinase receptor of the
natural ligand EGF, with EGFR activating numerous
signaling cascades associated with proliferation,
migration, and drug resistance, notably the Raf/MEK/ERK
and PI3K/AKT pathway [46]. Both in vitro and in vivo
analyses revealed that FM807 potently inhibited EGFR
and its downstream signaling (Figures 3A, 3B, 4C and 4D).
Moreover, FM807 was found to suppress EGF-stimulated
EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades and to
simultaneously downregulate total EGFR, C-Raf, and
AKT levels. This observation raises the possibility that
FM807 may have clinical benefit for NPC patients with
high EGFR expression.
Moreover, FM807 showed better inhibition in
poorly-differentiated CNE2 cells compared to welldifferentiated CNE1 cells. It also had better antitumor
effects in CNE2 xenografts models when compared to
CNE1-derived models (Figure 4A and 4C), with IC50 values
of 3.59 and 25.75 µM, respectively. This is a promising
finding, as CNE2 cells are more malignant than CNE1 [1].
To better clarify how FM807 might lead to such
different chemosensitivities, we used western blot
analysis to determine cytoplasmic and nuclear protein
levels. Our results revealed higher nuclear β-catenin,
Cyclin D1 and c-Myc levels in CNE1. β-catenin is a key
effector of Wnt signaling, and nuclear β-catenin levels
are increased in 92% of NPC tumors, thus rendering it an
important component of NPC development [27]. Aberrant
intranuclear β-catenin activates numerous downstream
transcription factors, including Cyclin D1 and c-Myc,
to promote cell proliferation and differentiation. Cyclin
D1 is response for cell progression through G1 phase,
and overexpression of Cyclin D1 enables cells with
unrepaired structural or genomic damage to traverse
the G1/S checkpoint, thus increasing the risk of tumor
formation [47–49]. C-Myc is also critical to the regulation
of G1/S phase proteins, and upregulation of c-Myc
is a common occurrence in cancers for chromosomal
translocations and point mutations [50, 51]. Decreases in
nuclear β-catenin, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc were observed
in both CNE1 and CNE2 cells (Figure 6B, 6C and 6D),
These decreases likely contributed to a decrease in the
DNA repair and replication capacity resulting from
FM807 inhibition of Hsp90, thus preventing cell from
transitioning into the S phase and arresting it in the G1
phase (Figure 2).

(P-AKT) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
MTS was obtained from Promega. The Annexin V:
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Apoptosis Detection Kit
I was purchased from BD Biosciences.

Preparation of Hsp90 proteins
Full-length (1-732, 90 kDa), N-terminal nucleotide
binding domain (NBD) (1-236, 25 kDa), the middle
domain (MD) (272-617, 40 kDa) and C-terminal
dimerization domain (CDD) (629-732, 15 kDa) versions
of recombinant yeast Hsp90 proteins with histidine-tag
were prepared as previously described [22].

Chemoproteomics assay
CNBr-activated Sepharose™4B (GE Healthcare) was
swelled in 1mM HCl and washed with coupling buffer
(0.1 M NaHCO3, 0.5M NaCl, pH = 8.3). After the resin was
swelled, washed, and added to the coupling buffer, FM807
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to
the resin (up to 10 µmoles per mL of medium). The mixture
was rotated end over end for 4 h at room temperature, and
excess ligand was removed by washing with coupling buffer.
Any remaining active groups were blocked for 2 h at room
temperature with the capping solution. The column was then
equilibrated with coupling buffer for 1 h. Hsp90 test proteins
were added to the resin, the mixture was rotated overnight
at 4°C. Any unbound proteins were removed by washing
buffer. Loading buffer was added to the resin, boiled for
10 min, and separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein separation was
followed by western blotting for the protein of interest.

assayed with immunoblotting.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103/well),
and treated with various concentrations of Cur and
FM807. Cell viability was assessed after treatment using
an MTS assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Results were calculated based on the
principle that the number of living cells was proportional
to MTS absorbance at 490 nm. All results are presented
as means ± SD from three independent experiments.
Inhibition graphs used mean values obtained from each
concentration relative to control values. Half maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated using
PASWstatistics 18 (SPSS, Inc).

Colorimetric determination of ATPase activity
Malachite green reagent [50, 51] was prepared on
the day of use, which contained malachite green (0.0812%,
w/v), polyvinyl alcohol (2.32%, w/v, dissolves with
difficulty and requires heating), ammonium molybdate
(5.72%, w/v, in 6 M HCl), and argon water mixed in a ratio
of 2:1:1:2 to a golden yellow solution. The assay buffer
consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM KCl, and 6 mM
MgCl2, with a pH of 7.4. The experiments were performed
in 100 µL of test solution containing 80 µL of malachite
green reagent. The test solutions contained 0.5 µM Hsp90
protein, 1 mM ATP, and different concentrations of FM807
or vehicle (DMSO) were shaken for 15 min at room
temperature. Absorbance values were derived from the
plate reading at 635 nm.

Colony formation assay
Cells were plated in 24-well plates (500/well) and
treated with various concentrations of Cur and FM807.
After two weeks of treatment, colonies were staining with
Giemsa for 10 min, and counted using light microscopy.
Colonies were defined as ≥ 50 cells.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene knockdown
Cells were seeded in antibiotic-free normal
growth medium supplemented with FBS. Single
siRNA oligonucleotides (obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) targeting human Hsp90α/β (sc-35608)
and control siRNA (sc-37007) were diluted in siRNA
Transfection Medium (sc-36868) and mixed with siRNA
Transfection Reagent (sc-29528) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were first incubated with
the transfection complexes for 6 h followed by normal
growth medium for 48 h. Cells were then treated with
either DMSO or FM807 for 24 h before cell lysates were
prepared and analyzed using western blot.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with
various concentrations of FM807 for 24 h. Cells were
harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at −20°C. After
additional washing, cells were incubated with RNase A
(20 µg/mL) at 37°C for 30 min, stained with propidium
iodide (100 µg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min, and
analyzed with flow cytometry (BD FACSC autoTM II).

Apoptosis assay

Quantitative real-time PCR

Apoptosis was determined using the AnnexinV:FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
DMSO or FM807 -treated cells were collected via
centrifugation and washed once with PBS. Cells were
stained with fluorescein and propidium iodide for 15 min
at room temperature and subsequently analyzed by flow
cytometry.

Total RNA extraction was performed with
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Corporation), and
first strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 µg of total
RNA treated with avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV)
reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) analysis was performed in triplicate with
FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) using
LightCycler 96 (Roche). The ΔΔCT method was used
to calculate relative expression. Primer sequences used
in RT-PCR were as follows: human EGFR (forward
5′-AAGGCTGTCCAACGAATGGG -3′ and reverse5′CCTCTCCTGCAGCAGCCTC-3′), AKT (forward
5′-TTGAGAGAAGCCACGCTGT-3′
and
reverse

5′-CACCTCCAGTCCCTCATCTG-3′ and reverse
5′-CTCAATCATCCTGCTGCTCA-3′), and GAPDH as
control (forward 5′-AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG-3′
and reverse 5′-AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC-3′).

Immunoprecipitation
Samples (500 μg of total protein) were incubated
overnight with 2 μg of primary antibody at 4°C,
after which 20 μL of protein A Mag Sepharose™ (GE
Healthcare, UK) were added to the mixture. The mixture
was then rotated for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated
protein complexes were then washed once with lysis buffer
and twice with ice-cold PBS. The resulting supernatant
was discarded and the antibody/protein complexes were
resuspended in 30 μL of loading buffer and boiled for
5 min. Proteins were then separated with 10% sodium

dehydration, transparentization and tissue mounting.
The number of positive targets was counted using
400 × microscope, and analyzed by HMIAS high-definition
color medical image analysis system (Wuhan, China).

Statistical analysis
ANOVA was employed for comparisons across
multiple groups, and data were reported as mean ± SD.
Statistical analysis was performed using PASWstatistics
18 (SPSS, Inc). P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

CONCLUSIONS

Western blot analysis

As a novel analogue of curcumin, FM807 inhibits
NPC cell growth, and induces G1 phase arrest and
necrotic/late apoptotic cell death in CNE1 and CNE2 cells
in vitro. Binding of FM807 to the N-terminus of Hsp90
likely blocks formation of Hsp90/client complexes,
resulting in degradation of the Hsp90 client protein EGFR
and inhibition of the downstream Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT pathway. Different intranuclear transcription
factors such as β-catenin, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, would
likely cause disparate FM807 chemosensitivities.
However, FM807 depletes these intranuclear transcription
factor levels by inhibiting Hsp90 nuclear chaperone
functioning. Based on these findings of tumor suppressive
effects and low toxicity in xenograft mice, this study
provides a preclinical basis for the further development
of FM807 as a novel therapeutic agent in the treatment
of NPC.

Protein concentration was determined using the
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of
protein were separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred
to PVDF membranes and blotted with specific primary
antibodies. Proteins were detected via incubation with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
and visualized with SuperSignal WestPico (Thermo
Scientific). All Western blots were repeated at least three
times to ensure replicability.

Tumor xenografts
BALB/c (nu/nu) athymic male mice, aged 4–5
weeks and weighing approximately 18–20g, were
purchased from Shanghai Institutes for Biological
Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. For the
xenografts, 6 mm3 tumor fragments were implanted into
the subcutaneous tissue of the axillary region of mice
using a trocar needle after which mice were randomly
divided into control and treatment groups (n = 6). Animals
were given daily intragastric (i.g.) administration of either
vehicle or FM807 (incorporated drug solid dispersions
with poloxamer188 and further diluted in physiological
