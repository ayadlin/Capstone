ABSTRACT
Endocrine therapy agents (the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators
such as tamoxifen or the selective ER down-regulators such as ICI 182,780) are
key treatment regimens for hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. While these
drugs are very effective in controlling ER-positive breast cancer, many tumors
that initially respond well to treatment often acquire drug resistance, which is a
major clinical problem. In clinical practice, hormonal therapy agents are commonly
used in combination or sequence with radiation therapy. Tamoxifen treatment
and radiotherapy improve both local tumor control and patient survival. However,
tamoxifen treatment may render cancer cells less responsive to radiation therapy.
Only a handful of data exist on the effects of radiation on cells resistant to
hormonal therapy agents. These scarce data show that cells that were resistant to
tamoxifen were also resistant to radiation. Yet, the existence and mechanisms of
cross-resistance to endocrine therapy and radiation therapy need to be established.
Here, we for the first time examined and compared radiation responses of MCF-7
breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7/S0.5) and two antiestrogen resistant cell lines
derived from MCF-7/S0.5: the tamoxifen resistant MCF-7/TAMR-1 and ICI 182,780
resistant MCF-7/182R-6 cell lines. Specifically, we analyzed the radiation-induced
changes in the expression of genes involved in DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell
cycle regulation. We found that the tamoxifen-resistant cell line in contrast to the
parental and ICI 182,780-resistant cell lines displayed a significantly less radiationinduced decrease in the expression of genes involved in DNA repair. Furthermore,
we show that MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6 cells were less susceptible to
radiation-induced apoptosis as compared to the parental line. These data indicate
that tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells have a reduced sensitivity to radiation
treatment. The current study may therefore serve as a roadmap to the future analysis
of the mechanisms of cross-resistance between hormonal therapy and radiation.

INTRODUCTION

proliferation of neighboring cells leading to breast
cancer development. In contrast, ERβ is essential for
breast tissue differentiation, and its loss is associated
with breast carcinogenesis [3]. The selective estrogen
receptor modulators (SERMs) such as Tamoxifen bind
to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ER preventing
its stimulation by estrogen, while the selective estrogen
receptor down-regulators (SERDs) such as ICI 182,780
(Fulvestrant, Faslodex) bind, block and increase the

Endocrine therapy is a widely accepted treatment
of choice for hormone receptor-positive breast cancers in
early stages and during advanced metastasis [1]. Women
with estrogen receptor- (ER) and/or progesterone receptor
(PR) positive breast cancers are the best candidates for
hormone therapy [2]. The ERα-positive normal breast
cells may produce growth factors that stimulate the

degradation of ER [3, 4]. Both drugs are currently
established as effective treatment therapy with beneficial
outcomes. Unfortunately, in the case of advanced disease,
acquired resistance to both drugs inevitably develops,
which is a major clinical problem [5-8]. Drug resistance is
usually accompanied with an aggressive cell behavior and
invasiveness. The evidence exists that the main mechanism
of hormone therapy resistance is the deregulation of
growth factor-signaling cascades. The over-expression of
growth factors, their receptors and downstream signaling
elements promotes hormone therapy failure [8-10]. Longterm estrogen-deprived tumor cells may adapt to low
levels of estrogen by increasing their sensitivity to it [11].
Such enhanced sensitivity to estrogen may result from the
activation of several signaling pathways such as RAS,
RAF, MEK and MAPK [12, 13]. Moreover, it has been
shown that tamoxifen- and fulvestrant- resistant MCF-7
cells overexpress receptors in the HER family, e.g. EGFR
and HER2 [5-7, 9, 10, 14]. The overexpressed EGFR and
HER2 are well known to recruit MAPK, AKT and PKC
signaling cascades [15-17].
The combination of hormone therapy and radiation
is widely used in clinical practice. The application of
tamoxifen and radiotherapy is believed to improve both
local control and patient survival [18, 19]. Nevertheless,
a suspicion also exists that tamoxifen may render cancer
cells less responsive to radiotherapy by providing a
protective effect against radiation. Early studies on cell
culture have shown that tamoxifen causes an arrest of
cells in the radioresistant G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle
reducing the radiosensitivity of tumor cells pretreated
with tamoxifen [20-23]. Today, the most important clinical
concern is the optimal scheduling (either concurrent
or sequential) of radiation and hormonal therapy
administration [24, 25]. Even less data and evidence exist
on the radiation response of cells resistant to hormonal
therapy, which we believe is important considering
the great incidence of resistance to systemic therapy in
patients with breast cancer. In their study, Paulsen and
colleagues investigated the influence of radiation on
different breast cancer cell lines including cells resistant
to tamoxifen (MCF-7/TAMR-1). The results of the study
showed that the MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells were more resistant
to ionizing radiation than the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cell lines [22].
In this study, we analyzed gene expression
changes during radiation responses in MCF-7 breast
adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7/S0.5) and in the tamoxifen
resistant cell line MCF-7/TAMR-1 and the faslodex
resistant cell line MCF-7/182R-6 derived from the MCF-7/
S0.5 cell line. For the first time, we have shown that MCF7/TAMR-1 cells have an elevated potential to withstand
radiation-induced DNA damage and display a decreased
sensitivity to ionizing radiation.

The effects of radiation on whole-genome
gene expression in antiestrogen-sensitive and
antiestrogen-resistant MCF-7 cells
The gene expression analysis was conducted for
MCF-7/S0.5 and the antiestrogen-resistant derivatives,
MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6, with the purpose
to evaluate and compare the radiation response between
cell lines. Differential gene expression in the MCF-7
cell lines was found upon exposure to radiation. In fact,
the expression level of 402, 371 and 187 genes was
significantly altered due to X-ray exposure in MCF-7/
S0.5, MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/TAMR-1, respectively
(Fig.1). Interestingly, most of the altered genes were
down-regulated. Amongst 134 genes that were common
for all three cell lines, 27 genes were up-regulated and
107 genes were down-regulated. The majority of gene
expression changes observed in the antiestrogen resistant
cell lines were also seen in the parental MCF-7/S0.5, (73.6
and 73.8% of the genes in MCF-7/182R-6 and in MCF-7/
TAMR-1, respectively). The least gene expression changes
were found in the MCF-7/TAMR-1 cell line which had
only half as many gene changes as the parental and ICI
182,780 resistant cells, and only 30 unique genes changes
in response to radiation treatment (Fig.1). Further, we
uploaded the gene lists consisting of 402, 371 and 187
genes from the MCF-7/S0.5, MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/
TAMR-1 lines, respectively, through the DAVID pathwayspecific enrichment analysis in order to identify casual
relationships between the genes and organize them
into specific pathways according to their functions.
Subsequently, the genes with similar or identical functions
were grouped together and organized by the KEGG
database into pathways. The least number of genes that
could constitute a pathway was three; therefore, only 83
genes and the 12 pathways they belong to were further
studied (Suppl Table 1). Mainly, those were the genes that
play a role in cell cycle, DNA replication, base excision
repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch
repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), p53
signaling, gap junction, drug metabolism, purine and
pyrimidine metabolism and spliceosome. Based on each
gene’s function and its expression trend, the roles of the
above-mentioned pathways were evaluated and compared
between cell lines (Suppl Table 1 and Table 1). For this,
the pathways were deemed significantly altered if at
least 80% of the genes from the pathway were shifting
the pathway in the same direction (Table 1) [26]. For
instance, in the MCF-7/S0.5 line, eight out of ten genes
from the p53 signaling pathway represented in Suppl
Table 1were changed in a way that functionally shifted the
pathway to the overall up-regulation. These eight genes

represented 80% of pathway significance in the MCF7/S0.5 line, which allowed us to conclude that the p53
signaling pathway was significantly up-regulated in the
MCF-7/S0.5 cells upon exposure to radiation (Table 1). An
identical analysis approach was applied for the remaining
11 pathways in each cell line. Table 1 demonstrates the
pathways’ specific differences between MCF-7/S0.5,
MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/TAMR-1 in response to X-ray
radiation (Table 1). As expected, 5 Gy of X-ray caused cell
cycle deregulation in all three MCF-7 cell lines (Suppl.
Fig. 1). The down-regulation in the expression level of
18 genes involved in cell cycle was common for MCF-7/
S0.5, MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6. These genes
constituted the components of the mitotic checkpoint
CHEK, MAD2L1, BUB1 and BUB1B, E2F transcription
factor 2, CCNA2 and CCNB2 encoding cyclins A2 and
B2, cyclin-dependant kinase CDC20, the components
of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex,
protein-kinase TTK, protease ESPL11 and a regulator of
chromosome stability PTTG1. In addition, MCF-7/S0.5
and MCF-7/182R-6 shared the down-regulation of RAD2,
CDC25C, CDC7, CDK2 and a negative regulator of entry
into mitosis PKMYT. Both antiestrogen-resistant cell lines
overexpressed growth arrest and GADD45A, a DNAdamage-inducible factor, upon radiation treatment (Suppl

Table1). The second pathway that like the cell cycle was
mostly affected by ionizing radiation in all cell lines was
DNA replication. 20, 16 and 9 genes involved in the
process of DNA replication were down-regulated in MCF7/S0.5, MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/TAMR-1, respectively
(Table 1). Specifically, they were components of the
minichromosome complex (MCM 2-7), DNA polymerases
A, D and E, replication factors RFC 2, 3, 4, and 5, the
replication protein RPA3 and others (Table 1). Moreover,
the main DNA repair pathways were also downregulated
in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 in response to 5
Gy of X-rays. Base excision repair, mismatch repair,
and homologous recombination were down-regulated
in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6; and nucleotide
excision repair (NER) was significantly down-regulated
in MCF-7/S0.5 (Suppl Table 1 & Table 1). Moreover,
the purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways that
could contribute to DNA replication and DNA repair
by providing the necessary deoxyribonucleotides were
also down-regulated in response to X-ray radiation. An
inability of cells to ultimately replicate and repair their
DNA leads to cell death. The P53 signaling pathway
was functionally up-regulated in MCF-7 sensitive and
antiestrogen-resistant cell lines in response to exposure
to radiation (Table 1). The decreased expression of
1681

tubulins, the main components of microtubules, resulted
in the overall down-regulation of the gap junction
pathway in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 cells which
could contribute to the apoptotic response; the downregulation of spliceosome in MCF-7/182R-6 is translated
into the absence of RNA processing that is necessary for
protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Interestingly, an
increase in the expression state of genes that contribute
to drug metabolism was observed in the MCF-7/TAMR1 cell line after radiation treatment. These genes were:
flavin- containing monooxygenase (FMO5), glutathione

S-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK1) and monoamine oxidase
A (MAOA) that could potentially increase drug-resistance
of MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells. Overall, although the radiation
response of the three MCF-7 cell lines was similar in
the way that all cells showed down-regulation of cell
cycle, DNA replication, DNA repair and activation of the
apoptotic pathway, the most dramatic response was found
in the antiestrogen sensitive MCF-7/S0.5 cell line. The
cells resistant to ICI 182,780 were also very sensitive to
radiation, while tamoxifen-resistant cells showed the least
dramatic response. Moreover, the up-regulation of the drug

metabolism pathway post-radiation exposure suggests
a possible strengthening of drug resistance by ionizing
radiation in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells. The gene expression
data have been confirmed by the qRT-PCR analysis on the
five genes that play a role in the cell cycle and apoptosis:
CCNA2 and CCNB2, CDC20, PTTG1 and BAX. Similarly
to the gene expression data, qRT-PCR showed a significant
down-regulation of CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC20, PTTG1
and up-regulation of BAX in the three MCF/7 cell lines 24
hours after radiation exposure (Fig.2).

-linking, nucleotide base damage, and most importantly,
single- and double-strand breaks (DSBs) which are wellknown inducers of apoptosis [27, 28]. Therefore, we
analyzed and compared the levels of IR-induced DNA
damage in MCF-7/S0.5, MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/
TAMR-1 cells by detecting γH2AX foci, a well accepted
indicator of DNA double-strand breaks [29] and by
the Comet assay. To better study the dynamics of the
appearance of γH2AX foci in MCF-7 breast cancer cells,
we added another time point (30 minutes) and a lower
IR dose (0.5 Gy) to the already existing experimental
conditions. As expected, the appearance of γH2AX foci
in all three cell lines was dose-, and time-dependant. Both
the intermediate (0.5 Gy) and high (5 Gy) doses of X-rays
caused a significant elevation in the level of γH2AX foci
in antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant cells
(Fig.3). The highest γH2AX level was observed at the
30-minute time point. Specifically, 12.1-, 7.84-, and 6.07fold changes compared to controls were caused by 0.5
Gy; and 27.3-, 20.5-, and 14.8-fold changes were caused

MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6 cells

by 5 Gy of X-rays 30 minutes after exposure in MCF-7/
S0.5, MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6, respectively
(Fig.3). Here, it is important to note that 30 minutes after
exposure to 0.5 and 5 Gy of X-rays both antiestrogenresistant cell lines accumulated significantly less DSBs
than their antiestrogen-sensitive parental line MCF-7/
S0.5 line. Approximately a halfway decrease in the level
of γH2AX foci was achieved from the 30-min to 24-h time
point in all three cell lines indicating DNA repair and/or
damage-induced apoptosis during this period. Therefore,
at the 24-hour time point, the level of foci was different
from that in the control non-radiated cells by 4.12-, 3.03, and 3.11-fold for the 0.5 Gy dose and by 8.71-, 5.11, and 8.73-fold for the 5 Gy dose of X-rays in MCF-7/
S0.5, MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6, respectively
(Fig.3). Interestingly, MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells displayed
more complete repair of IR-induced DNA damage than the
other two lines 24 hours after exposure to 5 Gy of X-rays.
The number of γH2AX foci in tamoxifen-resistant MCF7/TAMR-1 cells at this time point was significantly lower
than in other cell lines. Overall, the immunofluorescent
analysis showed that the background level of γH2AX foci
was similar for the three cell lines, and the induction of
foci by radiation had a similar trend between the MCF7/S0.5 cell line and the two anti-estrogen-resistant cell
lines, MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6. Nevertheless,
MCF-7/S0.5 cells displayed significantly higher level of
DNA DSBs after each applied dose in comparison to the
antiestrogen-resistant cells. Additionally, MCF-7/TAMR1 cells were able to repair IR-induced damages 24 hours
after irradiation more efficiently than the other two lines.
In the comet assay, the super coiled duplex DNA
underwent unwinding and denaturation under strong
alkaline conditions [30]. This led to the reduction of
DNA fragment size and the expression of alkali labile
sites as single-strand breaks which are stretched out by
electrophoresis. A comet tail consisting of the broken
or damaged DNA fragments was analyzed through the
intensity in MCF-7/S0.5, MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF7/182R-6 cells after radiation treatment (Fig.4). A 5 Gy
X-ray treatment led to significant damage in MCF-7
parental and both drug resistant cells immediately (30
min) after the application. These damages are believed to
represent DSBs, SSBs, alkali labile sites, and breaks from
replication events. But the persistence of damages was
only observed in MCF-7/S0.5, and MCF-7/182R-6 cells at
the 6- and 24-hour time points, and no significant damages
were observed in the drug-resistant line MCF-7/TAMR-1
(Fig.4). Such difference could be associated with a higher
potential for DNA repair in cells resistant to tamoxifen.

IR exposure is known to induce apoptotic cell
death. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of IR-induced
apoptosis in MCF-7/S0.5 and two antiestrogen-resistant
lines, MCF-7/182R-6 and MCF-7/TAMR-1. Early apoptosis
is characterized by various changes in the cellular plasma
membrane; the primary change is the translocation of
phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner layer to the
surface of the membrane. Annexin V possesses a high
affinity to PS, and this allows for the early detection of
apoptotic changes [31]. Here, we analyzed IR-induced
apoptosis using an Annexin V assay for MCF-7 breast
adenocarcinoma cells 24 h post radiation exposure.
Interestingly, 0.5 Gy of X-rays did not cause any
significant changes in the level of early apoptosis in either
of cell lines. In contrast, 5 Gy X-rays led to a significant
apoptosis in all three cell lines (Fig.5). The percentage of
annexin V-positive cells increased from 4.96 % to 30.0 %
in MCF-7/S0.5; from 7.98% to 14.1 % in MCF-7/182R-6;
and from 1.7 % to 6.04 % in MCF-7/TAMR-1 at 5 Gy of
irradiation at 24 hours post radiation (Fig.5). Overall, the
annexin V assay showed that the antiestrogen-sensitive
MCF-7/S0.5 line is more sensitive to radiation-induced
apoptosis than the antiestrogen-resistant MCF-7/182R-6
and MCF-7/TAMR-1 lines.

DISCUSSION
The effect of systemic therapy on patients with
breast cancer has been widely debated. A variety of
alternatives for breast cancer treatment are constantly
expanding but the combination of chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, surgery and hormone therapy for the appropriate
treatment plan is still complex [32]. Although these
therapies have proven to be beneficial, a large number of
patients acquire resistance to treatments.
The purpose of this study was to investigate
radiation-induced gene expression changes in three cell
lines of breast adenocarcinoma: the parental MCF-7/
S0.5 and the antiestrogen- resistant MCF-7/TAMR-1
and MCF-7/182R-6. Using microarray technology tools,
we were able to screen differences in gene expression
in response to radiation between MCF-7/S0.5, MCF-7/
TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6. Here, we show that these
three cell lines respond differently to radiation at the
gene expression level. Gene expression profiling showed
that the expression level of at least 402 and 371 genes
changed in the antiestrogen-sensitive MCF-7/S0.5 cell
line and in cells resistant to ICI 182,780, respectively, due
to 5 Gy X-rays. However, in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells, only
187 genes changed (Fig.1). We believe that the ability of
cells to retain their gene expression potential at a close to
constant level regardless of DNA-damaging insults may
1684

be due to some features acquired by antiestrogen-resistant
cells and shared in other forms of resistance, such as
radiation resistance. Interestingly, most of the changed
genes were down-regulated in all three cell lines. Using
David software, we have revealed that these genes belong
mainly to the cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA repair
pathways (Suppl Table 1). The most profound down-

regulation of gene expression was observed in genes
involved in the cell cycle pathway (Table 1, Suppl. Fig.1).
The reduced expression of the S and M cyclins, cyclin
A2 and B2 (Fig.2), and their cyclin-dependant kinase
CDK2 indicate cell cycle arrest in S or G2/M phases of
the cell cycle (Suppl Table 1, Suppl. Fig.1). Moreover, the
similar down-regulation of the E2F transcription factor

may prevent cells from entering the S-phase. In addition,
the lower expression of PTTG1, the TTK protein kinase
that is usually present in rapidly proliferating cells, (Fig.2)
that peaks in the M phase, ORC3L that binds to origins
of replication, CDC7, one of the regulators of the G1/S
transition, CDC25C, an inducer of mitotic control that is
necessary for cell cycle progression, and CDC20 (Fig.2),
an activator of APC and a major regulator of cell division,
reflects cell cycle disturbance in all three cell lines. One
would expect that the cells were arrested at the cell
cycle checkpoints, but surprisingly, most of the mitotic
checkpoint regulators were also down-regulated. Among
them were: CHEK1 that phosphorylates the components
of CDC25 for cell cycle arrest; MAD2 that interacts
with CDC20 and is a component of the spindle-assembly
checkpoint that prevents anaphase until chromosomes
are correctly aligned, and BUB1 that is involved in cell
cycle checkpoint enforcement (Suppl Table1). These gene
expression data represent the total cell-cycle shutdown
and checkpoint failure which are most probably due to
extensive DNA damages caused by ionizing radiation.
Cell cycle checkpoints usually contribute to cell
survival allowing for DNA damage repair; and the lack
of checkpoints makes cells more sensitive to killing by
ionizing radiation [33].
Both the cell cycle and DNA replication pathways
shared the common down-regulation of six components
of the minichromosome maintenance complex (MCMs: 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in all three cell lines (Suppl Table 1, Suppl.
Fig.1). The MCM 2-7 helicase complex is important for
the replication fork formation and elongation during DNA
replication [34]. In fact, it is required for the assembly of
pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) at replication origins
at the end of mitosis and during late G1 [35, 36]. It is
evident that mammalian cells decrease the rate of ongoing
DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage at the level
of origin initiation and fork progression [37]. Obviously,
the inactivation of the MCM complex inhibits DNA
replication and cell proliferation and can be the mechanism
of cell cycle arrest. Indeed, the down-regulation of MCM2
and MCM6 was associated with Notch-dependant cell
cycle arrest in endothelial cells and human fibroblasts [38].
In response to genotoxic stress such as ionizing radiation,
the ATM/ATR checkpoint pathways are activated and
target stalled replication forks. The MCM complex is also
a target of checkpoint signaling [39]. Stalled replication
forks must retain MCM proteins in order to resume
replication. Otherwise, replication licensing cannot be
reassembled as origins fire only once in each cell cycle
[36]. The down-regulation of MCM 2-7 in MCF-7/S0.5,
MCF-7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6 (Suppl Table 1)
in response to X-ray radiation indicates aberrant DNA
replication or its absence and cell cycle arrest. In addition,
reduced expression levels of DNA polymerases add up to
the disruption of DNA replication and/or repair. Here, it
is important to emphasize that mainly DNA polymerases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 are inhibited, and
only polymerase PolE2 is also effected in MCF-7/TAMR1 (Suppl Table 1). The other necessary components
of the DNA replication/repair pathway which were
down-regulated in response to ionizing radiation were:
LIG1 (a ligase that seals nicks in double-stranded DNA
during replication, recombination and repair), PRIM1 (a
primase that synthesizes short RNA primers for Okazaki
fragments during discontinuous replication), FEN1
(an endonuclease that cleaves the 5’-overhanging flap
structure that is generated by displacement synthesis when
DNA polymerase encounters the 5’-end of a downstream
Okazaki fragment), RNASEH2A (a ribonuclease that
removes RNA primers from lagging-strand Okazaki
fragments), RFC 2-5 (replication factors that play a role
of a clamp loader for loading PCNA on DNA during
replication), and RPA3 (the replication protein that binds
ssDNA and keeps it unwound for DNA replication or
repair). Overall, 20, 16 and 9 DNA replication genes
were down-regulated in MCF-7/S0.5, MCF-7/182R-6 and
MCF-7/TAMR-1, respectively. Furthermore, the detected
down-regulation of purine and pyrimidine metabolism
mainly in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 contributes
to the decreased DNA replication/repair. The importance
of sufficient nucleotide pools in the S phase is reflected
by the G1 arrest when the pools are inadequate [40].
Further evaluation of genes by functional relationships
with pathways showed the similarity in the radiation
response between MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 (Table
1). Both cell lines exhibited a lower expression of DNA
repair genes following radiation exposure. Specifically,
the down-regulation of base excision repair, nucleotide
excision repair, mismatch repair and homologous
recombination was observed. In addition to the previously
mentioned genes (DNA polymerases, RFCs, RPAs, FEN1
and LIG1) that clearly participate in DNA repair, some
specific repair genes were also down-regulated (Suppl
Table 1). These genes were the following: uracil-DNA
glycosylase (UNG that excises uracil residues from DNA
that can arise as a result of misincorporation of dUMP
residues by DNA polymerase or due to the deamination
of cytosine); poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP2
that catalyzes the poly ADP-ribosylation of a limited
number of acceptor proteins involved in chromatin
architecture and DNA metabolism) and high-mobility
group box1-like1 (HMGB1L1 that binds preferentially
single-stranded DNA and unwinds double-stranded DNA)
in BER; mutS homolog 6 (MSH6 that heterodimerizes
with MSH2 to form MutS alpha that binds to DNA
mismatches, thereby initiating DNA repair) in MMR;
Bloom syndrome, REcQ helicase-like (BLM that unwinds
single- and double-stranded DNA in a 3’-5’ direction);
RAD51 homolog C (RAD51C that is involved in the
homologous recombination repair pathway of doublestranded DNA breaks arising during DNA replication
or induced by DNA-damaging agents); RAD54-like
1686

(RAD54L that is involved in DNA repair and mitotic
recombination) and X-ray repair complementing defective
repair in Chinese hamster cells 3 (XRCC3 that is thought
to repair chromosomal fragmentation, translocations
and deletions) in HR. Interestingly, two genes involved
in NER, damage-specific DNA binding protein (DDB2)
and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C
(XPC) involved in DNA damage recognition and initiation
of DNA repair were up-regulated in MCF-7/S0.5 and
MCF-7/182R-6. This might mean that DNA damages are
initially recognized, but the actual repair failed due to the
lack of downstream components of the pathway. Such
results demonstrate that radiation-induced DNA damages
(especially in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6) are too
great for cell survival and lead to DNA repair failure
and possibly to cell death. In contrast, there were no
significant changes in the expression level of DNA repair
genes in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells. The immunocytochemical
staining of cells for γH2AX proved the radiation-induced
formation of DNA damages, specifically DSBs, and
the initiation of DNA repair in all three cell lines. The
induction of the DSBs was dose- and time-dependant
(Fig.3). Although many DSBs were repaired in 24 hours,
the level of γH2AX never returned to the initial one. At
the 24-hour time point, a lot of DSBs caused by both low
and high doses remained unrepaired in all three cell lines.
Interestingly, MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells displayed significantly
lower levels of γH2AX foci at 24 hours upon exposure to 5
Gy of X-rays in comparison to the other two cell lines that
were shown to be DNA repair defective in gene expression
analysis. Considering, that γH2AX staining only detects
DSB damages in DNA, we performed the Comet assay
to evaluate the broader types of damages. These damages
are believed to represent DSBs, SSBs, alkali labile sites,
and breaks from replication events. Although, all three
cell lines displayed a rapid increase (30 minutes) in the
levels of radiation-induced DNA damage, MCF-7/TAMR-1
cells showed no significant persistence of DNA damages
(Fig.4). 6 and 24 hours after radiation exposure, the level
of DNA damages represented by the comet tail intensity
was similar to the control level in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells.
In contrast, the level of DNA damages in MCF-7/S0.5
and MCF-7/182R-6 cells remained high even at 24 hours
post radiation. These data suggest that MCF-7/TAMR-1
cells have a higher DNA repair activity after radiation in
comparison to MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 cells. The
ability to withstand and repair DNA damage may result
in reduced sensitivity to radiation and possibly demands
other types of cancer treatment.
The majority of DNA damage signaling proteins
may be inactivated by caspases during the execution phase
of apoptosis [41]. P53 is one of the main executioners
of cellular response to ionizing radiation and apoptosis.
Its levels are elevated in response to ionizing radiation
affecting a number of downstream effector genes, such
as Bax, p21, GADD45G and Mdm2 [41]. Radiationwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced p53 activation causes the cell cycle arrest
allowing for DNA repair and in the case of repair failure,
p53 triggers apoptosis [42]. In agreement with the above,
p53 signaling was activated in all three cell lines in
response to radiation. Up-regulated BAX (Suppl Table
1, Fig.2) is known to accelerate programmed cell death
by binding and inhibiting an apoptosis repressor Bcl-2.
The activation of sestrin 1 (Suppl Table 1) was previously
shown upon genotoxic exposure, and its cytoprotective
function based on regeneration of overoxidized
peroxiredoxins was described [43]. A few years ago,
Budanov and Karin showed that sestrin is a target of p53
and an inhibitor of TOR (target of rapamycin). mTOR is a
phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase that positively
regulates cell growth. P53-mediated activation of sestrin
upon genotoxic stress inhibits mTOR through the AMPresponsive protein kinase (AMPK) [44]. Gene activated
by p53, the ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2B), was upregulated in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 . RRM2B
plays a role in DNA repair of arrested cells by supplying
deoxyribonucleotides during cell cycle arrest in a p53dependent manner. Although it is not clear whether this
gene actually affected DNA repair, considering the fact
that its homolog RRM2 that also provided precursors
for DNA synthesis was down-regulated in all three cell
lines). Finally, the increased expression of Gadd45A and
TP53I3 in antiestrogen-resistant cells also indicate the
cell cycle arrest after X-ray treatment (Suppl Table 1).
The gene expression data correlate with the results of the
annexin V assay on early apoptosis. Exposure to 5 Gy of
X-rays initiated apoptotic cell death in all three cell lines.
However, the degree of apoptosis was different in between
the cell lines. The highest apoptosis level was detected
in MCF-7/S0.5 cells (30%), while in cells resistant to
tamoxifen, only 6% of the cells were undergoing apoptosis
(Fig.5). Such differences can be attributed to the radioresistance of MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells. In fact, although the
response to X-rays (such as an increase in DNA damages
and cell cycle arrest) in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells and the
other two cell lines was similar, MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells did
not lose their DNA repair capacity and exhibited lower
fraction of apoptotic MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells compared to
parental and ICI 182,780 resistant cells.
According to the gene expression profiling and
the data of pathway enrichment analysis, a strong downregulation of the gap junction pathway was caused by
the ionizing radiation in MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6
but not in MCF-7/TAMR-1 (Table 1). All down-regulated
genes that constituted the pathway were members of
cytoskeletal elements, tubulins alpha and beta. An altered
level of expression of cytoskeletal elements plays a
considerable role in radiation-mediated transformation.
The differential modulation of genes encoding cytoskeletal
elements upon radiation exposure was previously
documented, where actin and tubulin mRNA accumulation
was reported to be similar to that in transformed cells
1687

Oncotarget

[45]. Cancer cells are characterized by a complicated
ultrastructural organization. Breast cancer cells resistant
to doxorubicin and cisplatin display an increase in
the number of microtubules and varying widths of
microfilaments [46]. Tubulins are critical for cell division,
which made them a target for several anti-cancer drugs.
An elevated expression of tubulin correlates with a lack of
response to chemotherapy. In fact, βIII-tubulin expression
has been acknowledged as a predictor of the docetaxel
resistance in metastatic prostate cancer [47]. Another study
claimed that βII-tubulin is a strong predictor of outcome
in patients treated with the platinum-based induction
chemotherapy for locally advanced squamous carcinoma
of the head and neck [48]. A possible explanation for such
observation was based on the fact that tubulin binds to the
voltage-dependent anion channel, VDAC, and regulates
the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Binding of tubulin to VDAC inhibits the binding of
proapoptotic drugs which induce a rapid cytochrome c
release [48]. In the present study, a decrease in tubulin
expression in the MCF-7/S0.5 and MCF-7/182R-6 cell
lines indicates the inability of the formation of a tubular
apparatus necessary for cell division, and it also supports
the data on early apoptosis. In contrast, MCF-7/TAMR1 cells did not show any expression changes in a single
tubulin gene, which at least partly may contribute to the
reduced sensitivity to radiation.
In addition, three genes involved in drug metabolism
were up-regulated in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells. One of these
genes was glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (GSTK),
a radical scavenger that is involved in the metabolism
of xenobiotics. It was previously found that GST plays
an important role in the acquisition of drug resistance
through the decreased intracellular drug accumulation
and the stimulation of drug-induced DNA damage repair
[49, 50]. Using an in vivo mouse model, it has been
shown that tamoxifen-resistant tumors had a statistically
significant increase in GST activity, the increased levels
of other antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, and the
reduced glutathione levels [51]. The authors discussed
the effects of tamoxifen on the intracellular redox status
of breast cancers, the induction of lipid peroxidation and
the activation of antioxidant enzymes. Such oxidative
changes appeared to be tamoxifen-specific as they were
not found in ICI-resistant tumors [51]. In a recent study,
a quantitive proteomic analysis revealed up-regulation of
GST in breast cancer cells during the transition to acquired
tamoxifen resistance [52]. Taking into consideration that
ionizing radiation may also influence the redox status
of cells, we believe that GST may be involved in the
resistance of cancer cells to radiation, and therefore, may
be considered one of the common molecular indicators for
chemo- and radio-resistance. The second gene belonging
to the drug metabolism pathway was flavin containing
monooxygenase 5 (FMO). The protein product of this gene
is an enzyme that belongs to the family of the enzymes
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

involved in oxidation and metabolism of xenobiotics. This
enzyme uses a flavin cofactor for its chemical reactions
[53]. FMO enzyme system contributes to resistance
to triclabendazole in liver fluke by metabolizing it to
triclabendazole sulphooxide [54]. While flavin-containing
monooxygenases were shown to convert tamoxifen to
tamoxifen-N-oxide (TNO), TNO may be reduced back to
tamoxifen by hemoglobin and cytochromes P450 [55]. The
third gene in the up-regulated drug metabolism pathway
was monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). MAOA product is an
enzyme known to degrade amine neurotransmitters, such
as dopamine, serotonine, epinephrine, and to cause severe
depression, but was also shown to be involved in the
metabolism of xenobiotics [56]. The up-regulation of the
drug metabolism pathway in MCF-7/TAMR-1 cells after
radiation treatment indicates that ionizing radiation may
potentially decrease the sensitivity of tamoxifen resistant
cells to xenobiotics and other treatment modalities (but not
necessarily only cancer treatments).
Most recent studies have led to development of
novel robust algorithms for transcriptome and pathway
activation analysis. These may in turn be related to the
potential responsiveness to chemotherapy agents. In
the future it would be prudent to conduct transcriptome
pathways profiling using these novels tools [57-59].
This study provides the analysis of the roles of
DNA repair, and apoptosis in response to radiation in
antiestrogen-sensitive and antiestrogen-resistant cell
lines. The ability of tamoxifen-resistant cells to retain
their DNA repair capacity upon radiation treatment allows
us to suggest that DNA repair genes could possibly be
considered as putative targets of the future development
of novel anticancer regimens. Further detailed studies are
needed to determine the cellular and molecular processes
that are altered in resistant cells that allow them to survive
genotoxic treatments such as irradiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture conditions
The MCF-7/S0.5 (MCF-7), MCF-7/TAMR-1
(TAMR-1) and MCF-7/182R-6 (182R-6) cell sublines were
a kind gift from Anne Lykkesfeldt (Breast Cancer Group,
Cell Death and Metabolism, Danish Cancer Society
Research Center, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark).
Subline 0.5 derived from MCF-7 cells was originally
adapted to grow on 0.5% fetal calf serum [60]. Tamoxifen
and ICI 182,780 (fulvestrant, Faslodex) resistant sublines
were derived from MCF-7/S0.5 as described previously
[61, 62]. MCF-7/S0.5 cells were grown and maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM /F-12)
with 2.5 mM L-Glutamine, without HEPES and Phenol
Red (HyClone, Logan, UT), supplemented with 2% heat1688

Oncotarget

inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT)
and 6 ng/ml of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO) at 37 ºC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The MCF7/TAMR-1 and MCF-7/182R-6 cell lines were grown in
the identical medium as described above for the MCF-7/
S0.5 line and were additionally supplemented with either
1 μM tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.1 μM ICI 182,70
(Tocris Bioscience), respectively. Cells were harvested for
analyses by trypsinization.

enzymes, thus preparing samples for hybridization.

Hybridization and detection
The Illumina’s direct hybridization assay kit was
used to process samples according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Overnight 750 ng
of each cRNA sample were hybridized into the Illumina
HumanHT-12_v4 Whole Genome Expression BeadChip
arrays. A10-minute incubation in the supplied wash
buffer at 55ºC preceded a 5-minute room temperature
wash. The arrays were incubated in 100% ethanol for
10 minutes. A second room temperature wash lasted two
minutes with gentle shaking, thus completing this highstringency wash. The arrays were blocked with a buffer
for 10 minutes and washed before a streptavidin-Cy3
(1:1000) probe for 10 minutes. After a five-minute wash at
room temperature, the BeadChips were dried and imaged.
Six controls were also built into the Whole-Genome
Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay system
to cover the aspects of array experiments, including
controls for: the biological specimen (14 probes for
housekeeping controls), three controls for hybridization
(six probes for Cy3-labeled hybridization, four probes
for low-stringency hybridization, and one probe for
high-stringency hybridization), signal generation (two
probes for biotin control), and approximately 800 probes
for negative controls on an eight-sample BeadChip. The
arrays were scanned on the iScan platform (Illumina), and
the data were normalized and scrutinized using Illumina
BeadStudio Software.

Irradiation conditions
Cells were irradiated at 80% confluence in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). Two
radiation doses (0.5 Gy and 5 Gy, 90 kVp, 5 mA) were
applied to check cellular radiation responses. Unirradiated
cells served as controls. Cells were harvested 30 minutes
and 24 hours after irradiation. All treatments were tested in
triplicate. The experiments were independently reproduced
twice.

Whole-genome gene expression profiling

RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated using the Illustra RNAspin
mini kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK). Approximately 5 x 106 cultured cells were processed
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were
eluted in Ultrapure DNase/RNase-free distilled water
provided in the kit. RNA samples were quantified using
ultraviolet spectroscopy (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE)
and were further assessed for RNA integrity (RIN) on the
Aglient 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA) using the
RNA Nano-chip Kit. RNA samples with RIN values of
seven or higher were used for further analysis.

BeadChip statistical analysis and data processing
The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using
the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The Illumina Custom
Model took FDR into account and was used to analyze
the data. Differential gene expression (at least a 0.5-fold
change) from non-radiated cells was determined to be
statistically significant if the p value after the adjustment
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method was lower than
0.05. The values were transformed to show a log2 scale.
Lists of regulated transcripts were inserted into the
web-based DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (NIAID/
NIH) Functional Annotation Tool [46, 63]. This program
was used to group genes into functionally relevant
categories: metabolic processes, responses to stimulus/
stress, DNA repair processes, apoptosis, and cell cycle
processes. The minimum number of genes in each altered
pathway has been set to three in order for a pathway to be
considered for further evaluation. The pathways deemed
significantly altered if at least 80% of genes were shifting
the pathway in the same direction [26].

Library preparation
cDNA was created using the Ambion’s Illumina
TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA) with an input of 500 ng of total RNA per
sample. Briefly, oligo-dT primers were used to synthesize
first-strand cDNA containing the phage T7 promoter
sequence. Single-stranded cDNA was converted into a
double-stranded DNA template via DNA polymerase.
Simultaneously, RNase H degraded the RNA. Samples
of cDNA were purified in the Filter Cartridge to remove
excess RNA, primers, enzymes, and salts. The recovered
cDNA was subjected to in vitro transcription using
biotinylated UTPs. In this step, cRNA was created,
labeled, and amplified. A final purification step removed
unincorporated NTPs, salts, inorganic phosphates and

Quantitative real-time PCR

QRT-PCR statistical analysis

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to
confirm the results of the Whole-Genome Gene Expression
analysis for the regulation of the direction (either up or
down) of selected genes. Five genes (CCNA2, CCNB2
CDC20, PTTG1 and BAX) were selected from the gene
list of significantly differentially expressed transcripts
representing a preliminary review of the acquired gene
expression data. Actin was used as a reference gene. All
reactions were performed using cDNA synthesized from
the same RNA extraction as the BeadChip experiments,
and 500 ng of the sample was used for the Bio-Rad iScript
Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). The samples were stored at -20ºC for
long-term storage and at 4ºC until they were used for the
subsequent qRT-PCR reactions.
Primers were designed using the NCBI database
and PrimerQuest (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc,
Coralville, IA). The following primers were designed: the
forward primer for the ACTA2 reference gene (5’-TAG
CAC CCA GCA CCA TGA AGA TCA-3’) and the reverse
primer (5’-GAA GCA TTT GCG GTG GAC AAT GGA3’); CCNA2 forward primer (5’-ATG AGC ATG TCA
CCG TTC CTC CTT-3’) and the reverse primer (5’-TCA
GCT GGC TTC TTC TGA GCT TCT-3’); CCNB forward
primer (5’-TGC TTC CTG CTT GTC TCA GAA GGT3’) and the reverse primer (5’-CAT TCT TGG CCA TGT
GCT GCA TGA-3’); CDC20 forward primer (5’-ATG
CGC CAG AGG GTT ATC AGA ACA-3’) and the reverse
primer (5’-CAT TTC GGA TTT CAG GCG CAT CCA3’); PTTG1 forward primer (5’-AGT GGA GTG CCT
CTC ATG ATC CTT-3’) and the reverse primer (5’-TCC
AGG GTC GAC AGA ATG CTT GAA-3’); BAX forward
primer (5’-TTT CTG ACG GCA ACT TCA ACT GGG3’) and the reverse primer (5’- TGT CCA GCC CAT GAT
GGT TCT GAT-3’). The reactions were prepared using
1 μL of diluted cDNA, 10 pmol/μL of each forward and
reverse primer, and SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) prepared according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were prepared
in triplicate and were run on the Bio-Rad C1000 Thermal
Cycler equipped with the CFX96 Real-Time System. The
qRT-PCR protocol consisted of denaturation at 95ºC for
2 minutes; 43 cycles of denaturation (95ºC, 5 seconds)
and annealing/extension (55ºC, 5 seconds); and a final
extension at 65ºC for 5 seconds. Annealing temperature
optimization, melting curve analysis, and gel analysis of
the amplicon were performed for every set of primers. To
evaluate PCR efficiency, a standard curve was established
using a series of cDNA dilutions. The data was captured
and organized using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 2.1 software
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

The quantification data from the Bio-Rad CFX
Manager software were analyzed using the Pfaffl method
in Microsoft Excel [49]. Graphs showing a fold change
from the untreated cells were created, and transcript
regulation directions (up- or down-regulation) were
matched to the results of the Whole-Genome Gene
Expression analysis.

Immunofluorescence
For immunocytochemical analysis, cells were
grown on two-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nulge Nunc
International Corp., Naperville, IL) and irradiated. After
irradiation, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS, permeabilized with 70% ethanol, and washed
in PBS containing 0.1% TRITON-X100. Blocking was
done in 8% BSA in PBS. For immunocytochemical
detection, the cells were incubated for two hours at
room temperature using an anti-γH2AX (Ser 139) rabbit
antibody (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers,
MA). Afterwards, the cells were rinsed and incubated with
a 1:500 diluted secondary antibody - goat anti-rabbit IgG
Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 0.1 mg/mL
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI)
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The slides
were mounted with an anti-fade fluorescence medium
prepared from 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO),
polyvinyl alcohol and glycerol and analyzed using a Zeiss
epifluorescent microscope.
The number of γH2AX foci per cell was counted
in at least 2`00 cells from each cell group, as previously
described [50]. The levels of γH2AX were represented as
the mean ± SE; P ≤ 0.05.

Alkaline Comet Assay
The alkaline comet assay protocol was based on
Olive and Bannath (2006) and Tice and Vasques (1995)
at cometassay.com [64, 65]. The cells that were grown in
cultures were trypsinised, collected in 15-ml tubes, and
centrifuged for three min at 1000 g to form a pellet. Next,
the pellet was washed three times with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) without -Ca2+ and -Mg2+. Finally,
the cells were resuspended in their final concentration of
1000 cells per 1 µL of cell suspension in ice-cold PBS.
The cell suspension was stored on ice during the course of
subsequent procedures.
Ten microliters of cell suspension were mixed with
75 ul of 1% low melting point (LMP) agarose pre-heated
to 40 ºC, mixed gently through pipetting up and down,
and applied to a fully frosted microscope slide (VWR)
1690

Oncotarget

that was pre-coated with normal melting point agarose.
The agarose was overlaid with a cover slip and allowed
to solidify for two to three minutes on ice. The removal of
the cover slip was followed by an application of 85 ul of
1% LMP agarose pre-heated to 40 ºC in order to form a
protective layer on the top of the layer containing the cell
suspension. The cover slip was repositioned, and the slides
were placed on ice to allow the agarose to solidify.
The cover slips were removed, and the slides were
placed in a freshly prepared alkaline lysis solution (2.5 M
NaCl, 100 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, 1% Triton,
and 0.1% Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosine (pH 10.0) adjusted
to 4 ºC), left overnight at 4 ºC, and protected from light.
Following the lysis step, the slides were rinsed with
a freshly prepared electrophoresis solution (300 mM,
2mM EDTA (pH>14)). Next, the slides were placed in an
electrophoresis tank, covered with a thin layer (1-2 mm)
of electrophoresis buffer, and left for 30 min to permit
alkaline DNA unwinding. Electrophoresis was performed
for 25 minutes at 0.7 V/cm. Each electrophoresis included
slides that belonged to the same experimental time-point.
After the completion of electrophoresis, the
slides were washed three times for five minutes in a
neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris (pH=7.5)). The slides
were stained with SYBR gold dye (Invitrogen), the comets
were viewed using a epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss),
and the image information was collected using a Comet
Assay IV system (Perceptive Instruments).
The statistical analysis was performed to obtain
the tail intensity data using SPSS software (IBM) and
according to recommendations on the statistical analysis
of the Comet assay [37]. The data was collected from
three replicate cell culture flasks, at two slides per flask,
and 50 cells were examined on each slide. The median
of the log tail intensity from 50 cells was evaluated per
each slide followed by the calculation of the mean of two
medians from two slides derived from one cell culture
flask. Finally, the mean values were compared between
three flasks representing each treatment point using a oneway ANOVA. The levels of tail intensity were represented
as mean ± SD; P ≤ 0.05.

For the early detection of apoptosis, an Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cells were grown and irradiated as previously
described (Section 2.2). The analysis was performed 24
hours after exposure to radiation. Cells were harvested,
washed with PBS, resuspended in a 1X binding buffer,
stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide for 15 min
at 25 ºC in the dark, and analyzed using flow cytometry
within one hour at the Flow Cytometry Core Facility
(University of Calgary, Calgary, AB). The results were
represented as a percentage of gated Annexin V positive
