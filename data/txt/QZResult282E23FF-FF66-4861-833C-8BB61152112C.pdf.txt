Abstract
In the BCR/ABL DA1-3b mouse model of acute myelogenous
leukemia, dormant tumor cells may persist in the host in a
state of equilibrium with the CD8+ CTL-mediated immune
response by actively inhibiting T cells. Dormant tumor cells
also show a progressive decrease of suppressor of cytokine
signaling 1 (SOCS1) gene expression and a deregulation of the
Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of
transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway due to methylation of the
SOCS1 gene. Dormant tumor cells were more resistant to
apoptosis induced by specific CTLs, but resistance decreased
when SOCS1 expression was restored via demethylation or
gene transfer. AG490 JAK2 inhibitor decreased the resistance
of dormant tumor cells to CTLs, but MG132 proteasome
inhibitor was effective only in SOCS1-transfected cells. Thus,
SOCS1 regulation of the JAK/STAT pathways contributes to the
resistance of tumor cells to CTL-mediated killing. Resistance
of dormant tumor cells to apoptosis was also observed when
induced by irradiation, cytarabine, or imatinib mesylate, but
was reduced by SOCS1 gene transfer. This cross-resistance to
apoptosis was induced by interleukin 3 (IL-3) overproduction
by dormant tumor cells and was reversed with an anti–IL-3
antibody. Thus, tumor cells that remain dormant for long
periods in the host in spite of a specific CTL immune response
may deregulate their JAK/STAT pathways and develop crossresistance to various treatments through an IL-3 autocrine
loop. These data suggest possible new therapeutic targets to
eradicate dormant tumor cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4491–8]

Introduction
In tumor dormancy, tumor cells persist in the host for a long
time but do not grow (1). Tumor dormancy is commonly observed
clinically and reflects the existence of residual tumor cells that can
lead to relapse, sometimes decades after treatment (2–7).
Understanding how malignant cells can persist in a dormant state
may lead to new strategies to prevent such relapse.
Little is known about mechanisms involved in tumor dormancy.
Dormancy may result from a balance between cell replication and
cell death (1, 6, 7), as in the BCL1 mouse model of lymphoma,

where an anti-idiotype immune response causes apoptosis (1, 8).
We previously reported that in the DA1-3b/C3H mouse model of
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), vaccination of mice with
leukemia cells that had been transduced with CD154, granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 12
(IL-12) genes led to significant protection against leukemia and
generated specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) against leukemic cells
(9, 10). In spite of this immune response, we detected several
hundred persistent leukemic cells in long-term surviving mice (11).
Persistent leukemic cells were more resistant to specific CTLmediated killing because they expressed more B7-H1, and
expression was proportional to the time they had persisted in
the host. These data indicate that tumor dormancy may result from
a balance between host immune response and active mechanisms
developed by tumor cells to escape from cytotoxic cells. However,
the low number of persistent cells suggests that they might also
develop endogenous mechanisms to resist cell death.
A possible candidate for regulation of apoptosis in dormant
tumor cells is suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). SOCS1 is
an inducible SH2-containing inhibitor of Janus-activated kinase
(JAK) kinases and can suppress cytokine signaling (12). SOCS1 may
also direct JAK proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (13). In
several tumor types, inactivation of SOCS1 by promoter methylation has been reported. Ectopic expression of SOCS1 abolishes
proliferation that was mediated by a mutated KIT receptor, TELJAK2, or by v-ABL, suggesting that SOCS1 has a tumor-suppressor
activity (14–16). Here, we investigated if SOCS1 might regulate
apoptosis of dormant tumor cells. We show that SOCS1 is
inactivated by DNA methylation, proportional to the time these
dormant tumor cells have spent in the host. This inactivation leads
to deregulation of JAK/signal transducers and activators of
transcription (STAT) pathways and cross-resistance to apoptosis
induced by CTLs and drugs through IL-3 overproduction.

Materials and Methods
Mouse model of tumor dormancy and cell lines. The leukemic
DA1-3b BCR/ABL-expressing cell line, the DA1-3b/C3H mouse model of
tumor dormancy, and isolation of dormant tumor cells have been described
previously (9, 11, 17). Briefly, C3H/Hej mice were injected intradermally with
irradiated IL-12–transduced cells (DA1-3b/IL-12). Each mouse received
three injections, 1 week apart, and immunity was challenged 7 days after the
last injection, by i.p. injection of 104 leukemic DA1-3b cells. To analyze for
persistent leukemic cells, we cultured 106 spleen cells per mouse and, after
2 or 3 weeks, obtained cell lines from mice killed at day 35 (cell line DA1-3b/
d35), day 60 (DA1-3b/d60), day 90 (DA1-3b/d90), day 120 (DA1-3b/d120),
and day 365 (DA1-3b/d365).

PCR on an ABI PRISM 7700 system using TaqMan Master Mix 2 (Applied
Biosystems). Data were normalized by 18s (PDAR 18S, Applied Biosystems).
Primers and probes were designed with Primer Express software and
purchased from Applied Biosystems (listed in Supplementary Table S1).
To quantify DNA methylation at the SOCS1 promoter, we developed a
quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) technique adapted from
previously published techniques (18). Bisulfite conversion of the genomic
DNA was carried out using the CpGenome DNA Modification Kit (Intergen):
1 Ag of DNA was treated following the manufacturer’s recommendations and resuspended in a total volume of 25 AL. Three different sets of
primers and probes were used to study promoter methylation of SOCS1
(listed in Supplementary Table S1). Q-MSP was done on an ABI PRISM
7700 system using the TaqMan Master Mix 2 and included water
blanks and positive and negative controls. Quantification of methylated
DNA and completion of the bisulfite modification were done as previously
described (18).
Methylation of the SOCS3 promoter was analyzed by MSP (primers listed
in Supplementary Table S1).
SOCS1 transfection and demethylation of dormant tumor cells. The
pBLAST45-mSOCS1 expression plasmid and pBLAST45 control plasmid
were purchased from Invivogen (Cayla). DA1-3b and DA1-3b/d365 cells
were electroporated at 1500 AF and 250 V and further selected with
blasticidin (Invivogen).
To analyze the re-expression of SOCS1 in persistent leukemic cells,
DA1-3b, DA1-3b/d35, DA1-3b/d90, DA1-3b/d120, and DA1-3b/d365 cells
were cultured for 10 days with 5 Amol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-azadC)
and 5 Amol/L trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum.
The immunophenotype of dormant tumor cells was analyzed by flow
cytometry, with previously described specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
(11, 17).
CTL assay. Specific CD8a+ CTLs were generated as previously described
(9, 11, 17). Target cells were treated with 50 Amol/L AG490 for inhibition of
JAK2, 20 Amol/L MG132 for proteasome inhibition, 20 Amol/L SN50 for
inhibition of nuclear factor nB (NF-nB), or 1% DMSO (Sigma) as control, for
24 h at 37jC. To stimulate the JAK/STAT pathway, target cells were
preincubated in 200 IU/mL IFN-g, 100 ng/mL IL-6, or 1 ng/mL IL-3 for
1 h before the CTL assay. Stimulated cells were also immunophenotyped
using the panel of antibodies previously described (11, 17).
For apoptosis studies, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was added to target cells at 100 Amol/L for 12 h.
To inhibit granzyme B, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin was used at 50 Amol/L for
16 h.
Flow-cytometric detection of intracellular phosphorylated STAT
proteins. Expression of P-STAT1, P-STAT3, P-STAT5, and P-STAT6
was assessed by flow cytometry with specific mAbs (Cell Signaling Technology; ref. 19). Cells were resuspended in culture medium at 106 cells/mL
and stimulated with IL-2 (200 IU/mL), IL-3 (200 IU/mL), IL-4 (10 ng/mL),
IL-5 (30 IU/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), IL-7 (50 ng/mL), IL-10
(100 IU/mL), IL-12 (20 IU/mL), IL-13 (50 ng/mL), IL-15 (10 ng/mL), GMCSF (100 ng/mL), IFN-g(200 IU/mL), or tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a;
500 IU/mL) for 30 min. Immediately after stimulation, cells were fixed and
then permeabilized (Intraprep permeabilization reagent, Beckman-Coulter)
and incubated with the appropriate antibody for 30 min.
Apoptosis analysis. Quantification of the sub-G1 DNA content, analysis of
depolarization of mitochondrial membranes, and production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) with DIOC6 (ref. 3; Bachem) and dihydroethidine
(Bachem) were done as previously described (20). Phosphatidylserine
exposure was measured with an FITC-annexin V labeling kit. Activated
caspase expression was assessed by flow cytometry with FITC-labeled
Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (FITC-VAD-fmk; Bachem). About 106 cells
were suspended in 1 mL PBS and incubated for 20 min with FITC-VAD-fmk at
5 Amol/L. Cells were washed twice, fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde,
and analyzed. NF-nB binding activity in nuclear extracts was determined with
the NFnB p50/p65 Transcription Factor Colorimetric Assay kit (Chemicon).
Cytokine dosage and blocking experiments. IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10,
IL-12, IL-15, IFN-g, TNF-a, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),

and GM-CSF production in the conditioned media (CM) of DA1-3b, DA13b/d365, and DA1-3b/d365-SOCS1 was analyzed by conventional ELISA
methods. IL-3 blocking experiments with CM were done using an antimouse IL-3 mAb (clone MP2-8F8; Tebu) or its control isotype rat
immunoglobulin G at a concentration of 2 Ag/mL.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were done using the Sigma Stat
3.0 software (SPSS Science).

Results
Silencing of SOCS1 in dormant tumor cells and promoter
methylation. We previously described the isolation of dormant
tumor cells from C3H/Hej mice that had been vaccinated with
irradiated DA1-3b/IL-12 cells and then challenged with wild-type
DA1-3b leukemic cells expressing BCR/ABL (11). A few hundred
dormant tumor cells were detected in the spleen and were isolated
after 1, 2, 3, and 4 months and 1 year of complete remission. We
established tumor dormancy cell lines DA1-3b/d35, DA1-3b/d60,
DA1-3b/d90, DA1-3b/d120, and DA1-3b/d365, respectively. SOCS1
mRNA decreased over time spent in dormancy, with complete
extinction after 1 year (Fig. 1A). When these dormant tumor cells
were incubated in 5-azadC, SOCS1 was partially re-expressed.
Expression was considerably higher when cells were coincubated
in both 5-azadC and TSA, indicating that promoter methylation
and histone deacetylation co-operate to lock the gene. The level
of methylated SOCS1 DNA increased proportionally with time
spent in dormancy (Fig. 1B). Direct bisulfite sequencing of the
SOCS1 promoter confirmed DNA methylation (Fig. 1C). We also
detected methylated SOCS1 DNA in vivo in the spleen of mice in
dormancy, ruling out that methylation could be acquired during
adaptation of dormant tumor cells to in vitro culture (Supplementary Fig. S1). As a control, we analyzed the SOCS3 promoter, but
it was never methylated, and its expression did not change (data
not shown).
Cells methylated on SOCS1 showed similar leukemogenicity
to DA1-3b cells when injected into naı̈ve mice. Transfection with
SOCS1 significantly reduced the mortality of mice (Fig. 1D, P <
0.001). This shows that SOCS1 expression plays a role in the
survival and/or proliferation of DA1-3b leukemic cells in vivo.
Deregulation of JAK/STAT pathways in dormant tumor
cells. Because SOCS1 inhibits the JAK/STAT pathways, we measured the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6
in dormant tumor cells after exposure to IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, GM-CSF, IFN-g, or TNF-a. In DA13b/d365 cells exposed to IFN-g,STAT1 phosphorylation was
increased compared with DA1-3b cells (Fig. 2). Transfection of
a SOCS1 expression plasmid into the DA1-3b/d365 cells reversed
this additional phosphorylation. IL-7 and TNF-a, IL-10, and
GM-CSF induced additional phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5,
and STAT6, respectively, in dormant tumor cells (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Reduced sensitivity of dormant cells to apoptosis. We
previously showed that dormant tumor cells are less sensitive to
CTL-mediated lysis (11). Dormant tumor cells resist CTL-mediated
lysis by overexpressing B7-H1 and B7.1, but blocking B7-H1 and
B7.1 only partially restores their sensitivity. We hypothesized that
SOCS1 extinction by promoter methylation might decrease
sensitivity to CTL-mediated lysis and to apoptosis generally.
Incubation in 5-azadC and TSA increased sensitivity of DA1-3b/
d365 but not of DA1-3b cells (Fig. 3A–C). A similar effect was
obtained by transfection of a SOCS1 expression plasmid (Fig. 3D).

Tumor Dormancy and SOCS1 Methylation

SOCS1 also enhanced lysis. Preincubation with the JAK2 inhibitor
AG490 increased sensitivity of DA1-3b/d365 cells but had little
effect on DA1-3b cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, preincubation of DA13b/d365 cells with IFN-g, but not DA1-3b (Fig. 4B) and DA1-3b/
d365-SOCS1 cells decreased sensitivity. In DA1-3b/d365 cells, we
verified that IFN-g did not induce B7-H1 expression that could
inhibit CTLs. DA1-3b/d365 cells already expressed a high level of
B7-H1 as previously reported, but IFN-g did not modify this
expression (data not shown). Expression of the other costimulatory
molecules B7.1, B7.2, B7-DC, and other cell surface molecules were
not modified.
These results suggest that extinction of SOCS1-induced resistance of dormant tumor cells is caused by deregulation of the JAK/
STAT pathway. SOCS1 reportedly inhibits JAK proteins by targeting
them to the proteasome pathway (21). Incubation of DA1-3b/d365
cells with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor had little effect on CTLmediated lysis (Fig. 4C). However, DA1-3b/d365 cells transfected
with a SOCS1 expression plasmid and DA1-3b cells showed a
decrease in CTL-mediated lysis, suggesting that CTL-mediated
killing requires SOCS1 expression (Fig. 4D).
To define the apoptotic pathway that CTL-mediated lysis
induces in DA1-3b cells and DA1-3b/d365 cells, we blocked
granzyme B using dichloroisocoumarin (Fig. 5A), confirming that
lysis involves the granzyme B/perforin pathway (11). The pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk also blocked lysis (Fig. 5B). Detection
of activated caspases by FITC-VAD-fmk showed reduced staining in
dormant tumor cells when compared with DA1-3b cells (Fig. 5C).

Recent studies showed that SOCS1 also regulates NF-nB
signaling via p65/RelA (22, 23). As NF-nB activity tightly controls
apoptosis, we preincubated DA1-3b, DA1-3b/d365, and DA1-3b/
d365-SOCS1 cells with the NF-nB peptide inhibitor SN50 (24). No
effect was seen on CTL-mediated lysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). We
also determined p65/RelA binding activity on nuclear extracts from
DA1-3b, DA1-3b/d365, and DA1-3b/d365-SOCS1 cells and found no
differences, suggesting that reduced apoptosis in dormant tumor
cells was not related to increased NF-nB activity (data not shown).
To determine if resistance to CTLs could also lead to drug
resistance, we irradiated cells (100 Gy) or incubated them with
5 Amol/L 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or 10 Amol/L imatinib
mesylate. Apoptosis, measured by annexin V labeling and the
percentage of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, was reduced in
dormant tumor cells (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S4). Their
mitochondrial transmembrane potential was lost, and fewer ROS
were generated (Fig. 6A). z-VAD-fmk reduced all characteristics of
apoptosis both in dormant tumor cells and in DA1-3b cells. Thus,
dormant tumor cells had developed cross-resistance to caspasedependent and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.
We analyzed the effect of re-expressing SOCS1 on apoptosis
induced by imatinib mesylate. DA1-3b/d365-SOCS1 cells showed
increased apoptosis compared with DA1-3b/d365 cells, indicating
that blocking SOCS1 may also lead to drug resistance (Fig. 6B).
When the dose of imatinib was increased up to 20 Amol/L, we
observed only a partial correction of sensitivity to apoptosis in
DA1-3b/d365 cells. As observed with CTL-induced apoptosis,

preincubation of DA1-3b/d365 cells with IFN-g reduced imatinibinduced apoptosis, and conversely, preincubation with the JAK2

would also modify the profile of cytokine produced by dormant

DA1-3b/d365 (d365-CM) or DA1-3b/d365-pB.SOCS1 cells (d365SOCS1-CM) and induced apoptosis with imatinib. CM from DA1365 dormant tumor cells but not from DA1-3b/365-pBSOCS1 cells

d365, and DA1-3b/d365-pBSOCS1 cells did not reveal any
production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-g, TNF-a, G-CSF,
or GM-CSF. However, dormant tumor cells produced more IL-3 and
IL-6 than DA1-3b and DA1-3b/d365-SOCS1 cells (Fig. 6D ;
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Adding recombinant IL-6 on DA1-3b
had a modest effect on sensitivity to imatinib and did not add to
the inhibitory effect of d365-CM (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
However, adding recombinant IL-3 almost completely inhibited
imatinib- and CTL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C; Supplementary
Fig. S6). Moreover, addition of an anti–IL-3 antibody blocked the
protective effect of DA1-3b/d365 CM on DA1-3b cells and restored
the sensitivity of DA1-3b/365 dormant tumor cells to CTLmediated lysis (Fig. 6C). Thus, the cross-resistance to apoptosis
of dormant tumor cells is mediated through IL-3 overproduction
induced by SOCS1 silencing.

Discussion
Tumor dormancy results from the interaction between the host
and tumor cells. In several experimental models, the immune
response controls dormancy (1, 2, 8, 11, 17, 25–30). We previously
observed in our mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia that
dormant tumor cells progressively express more B7-H1 and B7.1,
and that these molecules reduce CD8+ CTL-mediated lysis via
interaction between B7.1 and CTLA-4 and between B7-H1 with a
still unknown receptor (11). In other model systems, memory
T cells or specific antibodies interact with dormant tumor cells
(1, 8, 25, 31). These experimental models may be relevant for
patients. For example, in a long-term survivor of melanoma,

www.aacrjournals.org

immune response shifted to escape variants of melanoma cells, after
initial loss of antigen presentation by tumor cells, offering an
example of both immune editing and immune adaptation, and
resulting in equilibrium (32). Thus, dormant tumor cells may be
selected by immune pressure. Here, we observed that dormant
tumor cells progressively methylate the SOCS1 gene, ultimately
silencing expression. Methylation of the SOCS1 gene has been
reported in several human tumors, including lymphoid and myeloid
hematologic malignancies (33–44). Our findings suggest a possible
role in tumor dormancy. We showed a progressive increase of methylated SOCS1 DNA and a decrease of SOCS1 expression, suggesting
that methylation confers a selective but slow growing advantage.
SOCS1 inhibits JAK kinase activities by direct interaction with
the JAK activation loop and also targets JAKs to ubiquitin-mediated
proteasomal degradation. In our model, silencing of SOCS1
increased phosphorylation of STAT proteins after exposure to
cytokines. This suggests that in vivo dormant tumor cells, which
are continuously exposed to various cytokines, could have
enhanced JAK/STAT activity. To examine the consequence of this
deregulation of JAK/STAT pathways, we measured the sensitivity of
dormant tumor cells to CD8+ CTL-mediated lysis. As previously
reported, dormant tumor cells showed reduced sensitivity (11).
However, forcing the re-expression of SOCS1 by a demethylating
agent and histone deacetylase inhibitor, or by transfection with
SOCS1 cDNA, enhanced CTL-mediated lysis. Preincubation in
AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2, also enhanced CTL-mediated lysis of
dormant tumor cells, but preincubation in IFN-g decreased lysis.
IFN-g can act via the JAK/STAT pathway and can be regulated by
SOCS proteins. SOCS1 inhibits the JAK/STAT pathway in part by

targeting JAK proteins to the proteasome. Blocking proteasomes
with MG132 inhibited CTL-mediated lysis of DA1-3b cells and DA13b/d365 dormant tumor cells transfected with SOCS1. However,
in dormant tumor cells that did not express SOCS1, the inhibitor
had little effect. These data may suggest that sensitivity of tumor
cells to CTLs depends on JAK/STAT pathway regulation by SOCS1,
perhaps mediated via proteosomal degradation. In dormant tumor
cells, extinction of SOCS1 regulation protects tumor cells from
CTLs.
Constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is observed in
many tumor types and involves many mechanisms, including
mutation of cell surface receptors like FLT3 or KIT in AML;
methylation of SOCS1, SOCS3, SHP1; TEL-JAK2 translocation in
AML; and activation via BCR/ABL. Direct inactivation of SOCS1 by
hepatitis C virus in hepatocytes, or by phosphorylation of SOCS1
protein by V-ABL that results in JAK/STAT deregulation, has also
been reported (35, 45). JAK/STAT constitutive activation is involved
in many characteristics of tumor cells, including invasion,
metastasis, drug resistance, and proliferation. Constitutive activation could also contribute to the escape from immune surveillance
and, thus, to the equilibrium between host and dormant tumor cells.
In addition to its regulatory role on the JAK/STAT pathway,
SOCS1 has been reported to negatively regulate NF-nB via p65/RelA
(22, 23). However, we did not find enhanced NF-nB activity in
dormant tumor cells in vitro, but this does not rule out a possible
deregulation of NF-nB in vivo when cells are exposed to an
appropriate microenvironment.
Tumor dormancy is presumed to result from several mechanisms, including control of persistent tumor cells by host immune

response, and modification of angiogenesis. Transient inactivation
of oncogenes like MYC may also result in tumor cell differentiation
and persistence of normal-appearing cells that recover their
tumorigenic potential following oncogene reactivation (46, 47).
Tumor dormancy in these models is induced by a loss of
tumorigenicity. In contrast, our model shows a gain of function
that results in more aggressive tumor cells, and the observed
progressive methylation of SOCS1 suggests that persistent cells
divide in vivo. These two models of tumor dormancy may not be
mutually exclusive. Tumor cells may become dormant in vivo after
oncogene inactivation that results in tumor cell differentiation.
Deregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and active suppression of
T cells may be necessary for dormant tumor cells to resist
apoptosis induced by CTLs or other factors.
Dormant tumor cells showed a decreased sensitivity to apoptosis
induced by CTLs. CTLs, irradiation, cytarabine, and imatinib
mesylate induced apoptosis via a caspase-dependent, mitochondria-mediated mechanism. Apoptosis was reduced when dormant
tumor cells were exposed to these drugs. However, apoptosis
increased when SOCS1 was re-expressed, and exposure of these
cells to IFNg further decreased their sensitivity to imatinib. SOCS1
silencing induced an IL-3 overexpression in dormant tumor cells
that induced the resistance of these cells to imatinib and CTLmediated lysis, and anti–IL-3 blocking antibody was able to reverse
this cross-resistance mechanism. We observed that CM of dormant
tumor cells transferred the resistance to DA1-3b leukemic cells,
suggesting also that a paracrine-mediated resistance effect may
occur in vivo. We also found an overexpression of IL-6 induced by
SOCS1 silencing. IL-6 did not mediate significant resistance to

apoptosis. However, we cannot rule out that this overexpression
has a role in vivo to allow persistence of dormant tumor cells. Thus,
even if dormant tumor cells have only been selected by immune
pressure, they develop a cross-resistance through an autocrine
feedback loop both to immune response and to drugs. An IL-3
autocrine growth and survival loop has been observed in primary
human chronic myelogenous leukemia CD34+ cells (48). Adaptive
secretion of GM-CSF that mediate imatinib and nilotinib resistance
through activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in BCR/ABLpositive progenitors has recently been reported (49). In this study,
CM from the LAMA-84 imatinib-resistant cell line induced
resistance in imatinib-sensitive cells, and this effect was abrogated
with AG490 and an anti–GM-CSF blocking antibody. AG490 has
also been reported as an efficient inducer of apoptosis in imatinibresistant cells (50). Thus, the cross-resistance to CTL and imatinib
in BCR/ABL+ dormant tumor cells and resistance to imatinib in
BCR/ABL+ progenitors may share common mechanisms.
These findings suggest that long-term persistence of dormant
tumor cells may by itself generate more aggressive subclones, which
could escape from immune response after years of persistence.

It might also lead to resistance of relapsing tumors to various drugs.
The resistance of dormant tumor cells to imatinib mesylate in our
model may suggest that interaction between CTLs and BCR/ABL+
long-term persistent leukemic cells would lead to spontaneous
resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The finding that, in addition
to the IL-3 autocrine loop, in vitro exposure of these cells to IFNg
can also decrease their sensitivity to imatinib further supports
this hypothesis. New treatments that target the mechanisms that
cause resistance would eradicate these persistent cells before they
cause relapse.
