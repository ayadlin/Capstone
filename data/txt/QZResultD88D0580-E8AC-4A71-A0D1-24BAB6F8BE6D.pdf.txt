Abstract
Focal amplifications in 6p21 containing the VEGFA locus occur in 7-10% of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). A recent paper describes how VEGF-A stimulates paracrine secretion of
hepatocyte growth factor by stromal cells, which induces tumor progression. HCC patients with
VEGFA amplification are distinctly sensitive to sorafenib.

Liver cancer is a major health problem and the second cause of cancer death after lung
cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in patients with underlying chronic liver
inflammation related to viral infection, alcohol, or metabolic syndrome. Sorafenib remains
the only approved systemic drug for patients at advanced stages of the disease (Llovet et al.,
2008). Molecular therapies targeting signaling cascades involved in hepatocarcinogenesis
have been explored in phase III clinical trials, but none of the drugs tested showed positive
results in first- (brivanib, sunitinib, erlotinib, and linifanib) or second-line (brivanib and
everolimus) after progression on sorafenib (Llovet et al., 2014). Thus, there is an urgent
need to identify molecular subclasses of HCC driven by specific genetic aberrations which
can be effectively targeted recapitulating the success of crizotininb in ALK-rearranged lung
cancer (Kwak et al., 2010) or vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant melanoma.
Recent studies have provided a broad picture of the mutational profile in HCC and identified
an average of 30–40 mutations per tumor, among which 6-8 might be drivers (Villanueva et
al., 2014, Guichard et al., 2012). Common mutations are described in the TERT promoter,
TP53, CTNNB1, ARID1A, and AXIN1. Deep-sequencing studies confirmed frequent TP53
and CTNNB1 mutations in HCC and pointed to novel HCC-associated mutations in genes

involved in chromatin remodeling (ARID1A and ARID2), ubiquitination (KEAP1), RAS/
MAPK signaling (RPS6KA3), oxidative stress (NFE2L2), and the JAK/STAT pathway
(JAK1) (Villanueva et al., 2014, Guichard et al., 2012) (Table 1).

Studies assessing copy number alterations in HCC have consistently identified high-level
amplifications at 5-10% prevalence containing oncogenes in 11q13 and 6p21, whereas other
more common gains reported contain MYC and MET (Villanueva et al., 2014, Guichard et
al., 2012, Chiang et al., 2008). We described amplifications of 11q13 in 5-10% of tumors,
pointing to several candidate oncogenes including CCND1 (Chiang et al., 2008).
Subsequently, both CCND1 and FGF19 were identified in experimental models as bona fide
oncogenes in HCC and potential targets for therapy (Sawey et al., 2011). This finding
prompted the design of proof-of-concept trials testing FGFR4 inhibitors in patients with
11q13 focal amplification containing FGF19. Similarly, we defined high-level gains (>4
copies) of 6p21 containing VEGFA in 8% of cases out of 210 HCC patients explored.
Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between 6p21 gains and VEGF-A mRNA
expression (Chiang et al., 2008). Now an elegant study by Pikarsky’s group (Horwitz et al.,
2014) demonstrated that a subset of mouse and human HCCs harbors VEGFA/Vegfa
genomic amplifications. They explored the unique role of paracrine interactions by which
VEGF-A overexpression in HCC cells leads to production of hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) by stroma that reciprocally induces cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, VEGF-A
inhibition in experimental models induced HGF downregulation and patients with VEGFA
amplification responded better to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib.
Horwitz et al. found that 14% of HCC tumors developing in a mouse model of
inflammation-driven cancer (MDR2-deficient mice) harbored an amplicon in a region
syntenic to the human 6p21 region (Chiang et al., 2008). They confirmed VEGFA
amplifications and/or chromosome 6 polysomy in 11% of human HCC (out of 187 cases
tested). In experimental models, there was a correlation between VEGFA/Vegfa gains and
expression levels (mRNA and protein).

To elucidate the mechanism by which VEGFA amplifications induced tumor progression,
the authors first demonstrated that animals with amplification showed a higher vessel
density, macrophage content, and enrichment for tumor-associated macrophages expression
signatures. A relevant finding of the investigation is macrophage-tumor cell crosstalk.
VEGFA amplified tumors showed higher mRNA levels, and non-neoplastic stromal cells in
the microenvironment had positive HGF immunostaining. Using cells isolated from the
experimental HCC models, the authors demonstrated that hepatocytes overexpressed c-Met
and that macrophages overexpressed VEGFRs. In vivo studies showed that VEGF-A
overexpression in HCC cells induced upregulation of HGF, mostly in macrophages, and led
to increase proliferation and pro-angiogenic features. Functional confirmation of the role of
VEGF-A was obtained by blocking it in MDR2-deficient mice and Hep3B xenograft
models. A short course of sorafenib treatment in animals with VEGFA focal gains resulted in
VEGF-A inhibition, decreased HGF levels, and an associated decrease in HCC proliferation.
This finding is consistent with the decrease in HGF plasma levels observed in HCC patients
undergoing sorafenib treatment (Llovet et al., 2012). Finally, the authors retrospectively
explored a cohort of HCC patients undergoing resection who were further treated with

sorafenib. FISH-based selection of focal VEGFA gains defined a group of patients with
better outcome, pointing to this biomarker as a potential predictor of sorafenib response.

HCC is in need of additional molecular treatments in first- and second-line therapy and in
the adjuvant setting. Reasons for recent trial failures are heterogeneous and include a lack of
understanding of critical drivers of tumor progression and dissemination, liver toxicity,
flaws in trial design, or marginal antitumoral potency (Llovet et al., 2014). Ongoing trials
testing drugs head-to-head against sorafenib in all-comers might have difficulties in
achieving superior results in first-line. Novel trials are currently designed to test drugs in
biomarker-based HCC patient subpopulations. In this regard, the consequences of Horwitz et
al.’s study are two-fold. First, whether VEGFA-amplified tumors represent a specific HCC
subclass that responds better to sorafenib requires prospective confirmation with optimal
control for confounding/concurring factors. Phase III trials testing sorafenib have proven
benefit in all subgroup analysis of patients with advanced tumors (Bruix et al., 2012). Thus,
the question to be explored is whether VEGFA amplified tumors certainly respond even
better to this drug. Interestingly, a recent large phase III study testing sorafenib in the
adjuvant setting did not meet the primary end-point of recurrence-free survival. Whether a
subgroup of patients with VEGFA amplification might benefit from this drug in the adjuvant
setting can be now elucidated. Second, high-level VEGFA-amplification can be used as a
biomarker in phase II pivotal proof-of–concept studies testing drugs blocking VEGF-A or
VEGFR2 receptors. Other drugs beyond sorafenib, such as ramurafenib (a monoclonal
antibody against VEGFR2) or bevacizumab can be explored. In addition, dual VEGF-A and
c-Met inhibitors appear appealing in this setting. Such inhibitors (e.g. cabozantinib) are
being tested in phase III trials for second-line therapy.

Taken all together, Horwitz et al.’s paper provides experimental confirmation that VEGF-A
has oncogenic properties in hepatocarcinogenesis by inducing paracrine secretion of HGF in
stromal cells, specifically macrophages, which in turn lead to cancer cell proliferation.
Notably, it would have been relevant to explore if a genetically-engineered mouse model
reproducing this genomic aberration in a tissue-specific manner would have been able to
recapitulate this result. Similarly, although the outcome of patients bearing VEGFA
amplification suggests that they have a better response to sorafenib, the retrospective nature
of the results precludes any firm conclusion. However, they nicely point toward further steps
in designing prospective and poof-of-concept trials to confirm the hypothesis.

We are facing a new era for testing drugs in HCC as a consequence of discovering novel
oncogenic drivers (see Table 1). Although non-specific drugs will still be explored targeting
all patients, pivotal proof-of-concept trials or those with biomarker-based enrichment will
emerge for specific pockets of HCC patients which can completely change the treatment
paradigm. The study by Pikarsky’s group provides relevant information for moving towards
this direction (Horwitz et al., 2014).
