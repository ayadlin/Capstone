RSK Isoforms in Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis
Florian J. Sulzmaier and Joe W. Ramos

Abstract
Metastasis, the spreading of cancer cells from a primary tumor to secondary sites throughout the body, is
the primary cause of death for patients with cancer. New therapies that prevent invasion and metastasis in
combination with current treatments could therefore signiﬁcantly reduce cancer recurrence and morbidity.
Metastasis is driven by altered signaling pathways that induce changes in cell–cell adhesion, the cytoskeleton,
integrin function, protease expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell survival. The ribosomal
S6 kinase (RSK) family of kinases is a group of extracellular signal–regulated kinase/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) effectors that can regulate these steps of metastasis by phosphorylating both
nuclear and cytoplasmic targets. However, our understanding of RSK function in metastasis remains
incomplete and is complicated by the fact that the four RSK isoforms perform nonredundant, sometimes
opposing functions. Although some isoforms promote cell motility and invasion by altering transcription and
integrin activity, others impair cell motility and invasion through effects on the actin cytoskeleton. The
mechanism of RSK action depends both on the isoform and the cancer type. However, despite the variance in
RSK-mediated outcomes, chemical inhibition of this group of kinases has proven effective in blocking
invasion and metastasis of several solid tumors in preclinical models. RSKs are therefore a promising drug
target for antimetastatic cancer treatments that could supplement and improve current therapeutic
approaches. This review highlights contradiction and agreement in the current data on the function of
RSK isoforms in metastasis and suggests ways forward in developing RSK inhibitors as new antimetastasis
drugs. Cancer Res; 73(20); 6099–105. 2013 AACR.

The RSK Family of Protein Kinases
Ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK; p90-RSKs) constitute a family
of serine/threonine kinases that are activated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(ERK/MAPK) pathway. The four family members, designated
RSK1–4, share 73% to 80% sequence homology and have highly
conserved functional motifs. The proteins differ most significantly in their N- and C-terminal sequences and these differences may confer functional speciﬁcity to the isoforms (1, 2).
Structurally, all four RSK isoforms consist of two independent
kinase domains connected by a regulatory linker region. Full
activation of the protein requires a series of steps, including
phosphorylation by ERK and PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide–
dependent protein kinase-1), as well as autophosphorylation
by the C-terminal kinase domain (CTKD); ref. 1). Fully active
RSK phosphorylates diverse downstream targets through its Nterminal kinase domain (NTKD). To date, a large number of
cytoplasmic and nuclear RSK targets have been identiﬁed.
Through phosphorylation of these targets, RSKs modulate a

variety of cellular processes including gene transcription, cell
proliferation, and cell growth, and differentiation. They can
also mediate feedback inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway
through phosphorylation of SOS (for a complete review of the
RSK family see ref. 2). Three RSK inhibitors have been developed although none is speciﬁc to a single isoform. These have
been useful both as drug leads and in uncovering many of the
functions of RSKs.
Oncogenic EGF receptor (EGFR), Ras, and BRAF activate the
ERK/MAPK/RSK pathway in many tumors. RSKs can also be
activated in the absence of oncogenic ERK signaling in
response to hypoxic conditions (3). Hyperactive RSK signaling
is found in several cancers and supports cell transformation
and tumor growth (2). Here, we provide an overview of the
known RSK-mediated effects on tumor invasion and metastasis with emphasis on migration.

RSK Isoforms Control Tumor Cell Metastasis
Tumor metastasis occurs as a result of a complex set of
changes in the cancer cell. This includes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in which cells reduce cell–cell adhesion to the tumor and become mesenchymal and motile
through reduced expression or activity of cadherins and other
cell–cell adhesion proteins. As a result of EMT, cells invade into
the surrounding matrix and migrate away from the primary
tumor site. Changes in the cytoskeleton, integrin signaling, and
protease expression further promote invasion. Once tumor
cells move across the vascular endothelium into new tissues,

alterations in the cell death pathways protect the cells from
apoptosis and permit growth of metastases. RSKs are reported
to affect all these processes and are therefore well positioned to
play a signiﬁcant role in metastasis.
In vivo evidence of RSK function in tumor metastasis was
ﬁrst reported by Kang and colleagues, who showed that RSK2
promotes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
metastasis (4). The analysis of tissues from patients with
this malignancy revealed that higher RSK2 levels correlated
with increased metastasis. Knockdown of RSK2 in human
HNSCC cells also reduced the metastasis of xenografts in mice.
Importantly, these changes are only mediated through RSK2,
whereas RSK1 has no effect on HNSCC metastasis (4). In
contrast, RSK1 was later shown to be a negative regulator of
non–small cell lung cancer metastasis (5). In this work, a
kinome-wide siRNA screen was conducted on A549 lung
cancer cells to identify proteins that affect lung cancer migration. Silencing of RSK1 enhanced in vitro cell migration and in
vivo cell metastasis in zebraﬁsh. Furthermore, human patient
samples of metastasizing lung cancer have lower RSK1 expression than sections of the primary tumors. In these experiments
only RSK1 had antimetastatic effects (5). RSK isoforms therefore directly inﬂuence cancer metastasis. The simple conclusion from these two studies would be that signaling through
RSK1 acts as a negative regulator of metastasis, whereas
activity of the RSK2 isoform promotes it. However, in vitro
studies in other cancer models point to a more complex
network of RSK-mediated regulation of metastasis, showing
that RSK function is not only dependent on the isoform, but
also the speciﬁc cancer.
For example, in an independent RNA interference (RNAi)
screen for proteins that control migration in immortalized
breast epithelial cells (MCF10A), RSK1 was alternatively identiﬁed to be promigratory (6). Both chemical inhibition of all
RSK isoforms and speciﬁc silencing of RSK1 blocked epithelial
cell migration. The extent to which RSK1 silencing blocked cell
motility was not comparable with the chemical inhibition in
this study and the authors concluded that the other RSK
isoforms contribute to the regulation of cell motility as well
(6). Although this is a reasonable suggestion, there are other
possibilities including differences in effective silencing of the
kinase activity, inhibition of other kinases by the drug, or
timing of the inhibition. In addition, inhibitors target only
kinase activity and therefore permit RSK-mediated protein
scaffolding or binding, whereas siRNA completely removes
protein expression. Therefore, additional studies are needed
to differentiate effects of single RSK isoforms or concomitant
mechanisms. Despite this limitation, these studies taken
together support the hypothesis that RSKs act as regulators
of cell motility and other processes driving metastasis. Table 1
summarizes identiﬁed RSK isoform–speciﬁc functions regulating steps in cancer metastasis.

RSK Isoforms Induce a Transcriptional Program
Modulating Cell Motility and Invasion
RSK isoforms promote transcription and this can result in
changes in cell motility (Fig. 1, inset 1). Doehn and colleagues

systematically examined such effects using both knockdown
and inhibitor-based approaches (7). The researchers analyzed
two- and three-dimensional motility in a set of cell lines
including nontransformed epithelial cells and metastatic carcinoma cell lines. Treatment with several RSK inhibitors
(including FMK, BI-D1870, and SL0101) reduced the migration
of all analyzed cell lines. FMK also blocked TGFb/TNFainduced, ERK-dependent EMT in a colon adenocarcinoma cell
line. RSKs were therefore proposed to be primary mediators of
Ras–ERK–activated cell motility. Genome-wide mRNA array
analysis designed to determine the RAF-induced gene program
that is regulated by ERK and the subprogram regulated by RSK
further revealed that RSKs induce a FRA1- and c-jun–dependent transcriptional program containing genes with known
roles in cell motility, many of which act as mediators of EMT.
Among the differentially expressed genes involved in invasion
were cell adhesion receptors (integrin, a6b4), extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins (laminin), proteases [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)] and other signaling proteins (IQGAP1).
FMK inhibits RSK1, 2, and 4 isoforms at the same time and
so to relate the observed effects to individual RSKs, the authors
used isoform-speciﬁc RSK knockdowns. This showed that in
the in vitro breast epithelial model only RSK1 and RSK2
affected cell motility and that both promoted migration (7).
This isoform speciﬁcity needs to be further tested in the
corresponding invasive cancer cells. For example, the involvement of RSK4, whose expression could not be detected in
breast epithelial cells (7), might be higher in cancer cells.
Indeed, Thakur and colleagues reported that RSK4 suppresses
both growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells (8), further highlighting the potential importance of other
isoforms.
RSK2 also drives EMT in response to macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) activation in both Madin-Darby canine
kidney epithelial (MDCK) and pancreatic cancer cells. Upon
stimulation with MSP, the RON receptor tyrosine kinase
signals through the Ras–ERK pathway to activate RSK2, to
induce EMT, and to promote cell motility (9). However, many
of the experimental ﬁndings in this study are based on the use
of the RSK inhibitor SL0101, a compound that inhibits all RSK
isoforms. Although RSK1 does not seem to be required for the
induction of EMT in MDCK cells, potential regulatory effects
and contributions from the other RSK isoforms cannot be
excluded. Nevertheless, the current data support that RSKdependent transcription is one important mechanism that
regulates EMT and can promote cell migration and invasion.

RSK Isoforms Regulate Cell Adhesion
Dynamic changes in cell adhesion to the ECM and neighboring cells drive cell migration. In addition to changes in
transcription, RSKs can regulate cell migration by controlling
cell adhesion through effects on cell adhesion molecules such
as integrins, cadherins, and the immunoglobulin superfamily
(10, 11). In particular, RSK2 can control cell adhesion by
phosphorylating the scaffold protein ﬁlamin A (FLNa; Fig. 1,
inset 2). FLNa can bind to integrin cytoplasmic tails and induce
a conformational change that reduces integrin afﬁnity for ECM

Figure 1. RSK isoforms control motility and other aspects of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In response to hypoxia or hyperactivation of the RAF/ERK
pathway through oncogenes, RSKs modulate motility and invasion through effects on transcription (1), integrin activity (2), and the remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton (3). 1, RSK1 and RSK2 drive Ras–ERK–activated cell motility by inducing a transcriptional program, leading to EMT. 2, RSK2 controls
Ras-mediated inactivation of integrins by phosphorylating FLNa, an adapter protein that binds integrin cytoplasmic tails, suppresses integrin activation,
and cell adhesion. 3, RSKs modulate cellular adhesions and the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton either directly through phosphorylation of actin-binding
proteins (VASP or Hsp27) or indirectly through interference with RhoGTPase signaling (FAK or p27Kip).

This promoted FLNa binding to b1 and b7 integrin cytoplasmic
tails and suppressed integrin activation, ﬁbronectin matrix
assembly, and cell adhesion. FLNa seemed to be the only
protein in the integrin complex phosphorylated by RSK2. RSK
inhibitors, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown, and dominant-negative constructs of RSK2 all blocked Ras effects on
integrin activation, showing that RSK2 phosphorylation of
FLNa is a primary mediator of Ras–ERK–dependent regulation
of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and motility. Interestingly,
RSK2 was also activated by integrin ligation to ﬁbronectin,
suggesting a possible feedback loop that allows cells to bind
and release ﬁbronectin during migration (14). Although shRNA
studies revealed RSK2 functions in this regulatory process,
contributions of other RSK isoforms are conceivable and need

to be speciﬁcally addressed. Whether RSK2 prevents formation
of the focal adhesion complex or promotes its dissolution or
both was left unresolved. An independent study similarly found
that RSK inhibition blocked integrin-mediated cell adhesion
and proposed that RSKs regulate a5b1 integrin activation in
colon cancer and human squamous carcinoma cells through
FLNa phosphorylation (15). The study did not differentiate
between different RSK isoforms.

cytoskeleton to affect motility (Fig. 1, inset 3; ref. 4). Mechanistically, knockdown of RSK2 results in decreased phosphorylation of the RSK2 targets cAMP—responsive element binding
protein (CREB) and Hsp27, as well as c-MET and FAK, two
protein kinases that regulate cell migration (4). CREB-dependent gene transcription and c-MET–mediated signaling have
widespread effects that can alter cell motility (16, 17). FAK and
Hsp27 have been directly implicated in the regulation of cell
migration through their effects on actin remodeling and the
assembly of focal adhesions (18, 19). The authors of this study
used siRNA knockdown to show that the observed effects are
mediated by RSK2, but not RSK1. Contributions of RSK3 and
RSK4 were not analyzed. These ﬁndings exemplify how RSK
isoforms in a single cancer type can have diverse effects on
transcription and the cytoskeleton that together promote cell
motility.
The data on the RSK2 isoform has consistently revealed that
it promotes migration and invasion. In contrast, the data on
RSK1 are less consistent as this isoform is reported to have
both pro- and antimigratory effects depending on the cancer
cell. In melanoma cells, RSK1 promotes motility by increasing
the phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr198 (20). This induces a
relocalization of p27Kip1 to the cytoplasm where it binds RhoA
and blocks signaling through the RhoA/ROCK pathway. This
leads to changes in actomyosin stability, causing increased cell
migration. Here, puriﬁed RSK1 was examined in vitro and the
work also incorporated RSK1-speciﬁc knockdown studies in
cell lines. The ﬁndings therefore strongly support that RSK1
promotes motility in these cells. In contrast, RSK1 impairs lung
cancer cell metastasis and that has been attributed to changes
in the actin cytoskeleton as well (5). In these cells, RSK1
phosphorylates the actin-binding protein VASP at Thr278, a
modiﬁcation that impairs actin polymerization and results in
decreased cell motility. Phosphorylation at this site was not
mediated by any other RSK isoform. Only overexpression of
constitutively active RSK1 or inhibition with the RSK inhibitor
SL0101 were used to assess RSK1 function in this study. The
work would beneﬁt from reexamination with other approaches
such as knockdown or genetic deletion of RSK1 and the use of
alternative RSK inhibitors such as FMK. Therefore, RSK1 may
affect motility in opposite directions in melanoma versus lung
cancer cells. It is unclear what accounts for the observed
differences; although it may be that overexpression of active
RSK1 is inducing artiﬁcial effects that mimic another RSK
isoform or other kinase. If RSK1 indeed has the reported
opposing effects in these cancer cell lines, this would provide
a potential context in which to investigate how the same RSK
isoform might have different effects on cell motility that are
dependent on the cancer type.
One of the few studies examining RSK4 function in migration indicates that it can act as a negative regulator of breast
cancer cell invasion through effects on claudin-2 and CXCR4
expression (8). However, the authors did not take potential
effects of other RSK isoforms expressed in this cancer model
into account. Regarding the effects on migration, the study
relied entirely on the overexpression of RSK4, a method that
can lead to signiﬁcant artifacts, as overexpression of one
isoform might cause it to perform a function normally reserved

www.aacrjournals.org

for another isoform. As mentioned before, methods such as
isoform-speciﬁc silencing and inhibitor-based approaches will
help clarify the RSK-speciﬁc regulatory mechanisms in this
tumor model.

Targeting Invasion and Metastasis by Inhibiting
RSK Isoforms
Cancers kill when they become invasive or metastatic and
spread. Because some RSK isoforms promote invasion and
tumor metastasis, they are promising targets for the development of new drugs. Three inhibitors have been reported to
preferentially affect RSK isoforms with IC50 values in the low
nanomolar range. SL0101, the synthetic version of a natural
kaempferol–glycoside, acts by competing for the ATP-binding
pocket within the NTKD of RSK (IC50 ¼ 89 nmol/L). This
reversible inhibitor has been shown to block the activity of all
four RSK isoforms (21), but also affects aurora B, PIM1, and
PIM3 kinases at higher concentrations (22). FMK is a pyrrolopyrimidine compound that potently (IC50 ¼ 15 nmol/L)
inhibits RSK's CTKD. Through formation of a covalent bond,
it acts as an irreversible inhibitor. Because of the mechanism of
inhibition, FMK is speciﬁc for the isoforms RSK1, RSK2, and
RSK4 (23). Although FMK preferentially affects RSKs, at higher
concentrations in vitro it can also inhibit puriﬁed S6K1, Yes,
Eph-A2 and Src, and Lck (22). In addition, if the NTKD is
activated by other means than the CTKD, FMK will have no
effect. BI-D1870 is a dihydropteridinone that reversibly binds
the ATP pocket of the NTKD and inhibits its function (IC50 ¼
10–30 nmol/L). Like SL0101, BI-D1870 shows selectivity for
RSK over other kinases, but does not distinguish between the
four RSK isoforms (24). The only other kinase affected with
similar potency is PLK1. At 10- to 100-fold higher concentrations, BI-D1870 can affect aurora B, PIM3 MST2, and MELK
kinases (22). The high potency of these three compounds favors
their use as RSK-targeting drugs. However, none of these drug
leads show speciﬁcity for only one of the RSK isoforms and they
can also inhibit additional kinases depending on the inhibitor
and concentration. Mechanistic studies with RSK inhibitors
therefore require the independent use of two or more of these
compounds to exclude off-target effects. The inhibitors' target
overlap also opens the question of how useful compounds like
this could be for antimetastasis therapy. As discussed earlier,
RSK's regulation of cell motility can go both ways and blocking
the activity of multiple RSK isoforms simultaneously might not
greatly affect tumor progression or worse yet might promote
metastasis depending on the cancer. However, despite their
lack of isoform speciﬁcity all three compounds have shown
promising results in preclinical studies.
SL0101 blocks cell migration of neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, in this malignancy RSK2 activity is tightly regulated by
PEA-15, a protein scaffold that supports ERK activation of
RSK2. PEA-15 negatively affects cell motility and high PEA-15
expression correlates to reduced RSK2 activity and reduced
metastasis in patients with neuroblastoma (25, 26). RSK inhibition through SL0101 also inhibits migration of some prostate
cancer lines, but does not affect mesothelioma cells (14). FMK
has been reported to inhibit cell migration in neuroblastoma

and cervical cancer models and prevent invasion in a series of
human cancer cell lines including HNSCC, colon carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer (4, 7, 14, 26). These
studies also show similar effects of BI-D1870. In addition, BID1870 decreased invadopodia formation of ﬁbrosarcoma cells
under hypoxic conditions (3). Inhibitor treatment increased
the level of cell adhesion after EGF stimulation in carcinoma
cells and blocked cell migration in gastric and bladder cancers
(15, 27). These studies show that a drug lead does not have to be
speciﬁc for only one RSK isoform to be effective in blocking
cancer cell motility. Importantly, RSK inhibitors have not yet
been reported to promote migration, invasion, or metastasis in
preclinical models. Although the development of isoformselective RSK inhibitors would help to further clarify each
isoform's cellular function and would allow for a more selective
targeting of prometastatic RSKs, the use of the three less
speciﬁc RSK inhibitors could still prove to be a beneﬁcial
therapeutic approach for some cancers. It is expected that
the expression ratio of pro- and antimetastatic RSK isoforms
will contribute to the success or failure of RSK-targeted
therapy. A more rigorous proﬁling of cancers in respect to
their RSK isoform expression is therefore required to determine the beneﬁt of RSK inhibition. To date, no clinical trials of
RSK inhibitors have been published.

Conclusions and Future Directions
By affecting processes, such as EMT, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and integrin activity, RSKs act as a nexus in the control of
cell motility. However, the overall outcome of this regulation
varies among different malignancies and seems to depend on
the RSK isoform. Future studies must therefore focus on a
more comprehensive experimental approach to analyze the
contributions of all RSK isoforms to the observed outcome.
Multiple lines and primary tumor cells derived from the same
cancer type should be examined using RSK-speciﬁc inhibitorbased approaches that use two or more known RSK inhibitors
to determine whether the effects are RSK speciﬁc. In addition,

the analysis should include isoform-speciﬁc gene silencing
using multiple shRNA/siRNAs that target different sequences
or genetic deletion techniques, such as TALEN, ZFN, or
CRISPR/Cas9, to determine which RSK isoforms function in
migration, invasion, and metastasis in a speciﬁc cancer. Moreover, it remains to be determined whether RSK isoforms may
function to regulate each other in the dynamic process of
migration and invasion. The in vivo relevance of the in vitro
ﬁndings, while clearly shown in some cancer models, remains
to be veriﬁed for others in mouse models or patients. Nevertheless, it is now established that RSKs are versatile regulators
that control migration and invasion in response to hyperactivation of the ERK/MAPK pathway or hypoxia. This family of
kinases is therefore a highly promising set of drug targets and
inhibitors of one or multiple RSK isoforms could serve as
powerful new drugs to control invasion and metastasis and
thereby augment current cancer therapies.
