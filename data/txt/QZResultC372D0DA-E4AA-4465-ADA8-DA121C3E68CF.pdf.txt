Abstract
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, floxuridine) have activity in multiple tumors, and
both agents undergo intracellular processing to active metabolites that disrupt RNA and DNA metabolism.
These agents cause imbalances in deoxynucleotide triphosphate levels and the accumulation of uracil and 5-FU
in the genome, events that activate the ATR- and ATM-dependent checkpoint signaling pathways and the base
excision repair (BER) pathway. Here, we assessed which DNA damage response and repair processes influence 5FU and FdUrd toxicity in ovarian cancer cells. These studies revealed that disabling the ATM, ATR, or BER
pathways using small inhibitory RNAs did not affect 5-FU cytotoxicity. In stark contrast, ATR and a functional
BER pathway protected FdUrd-treated cells. Consistent with a role for the BER pathway, the poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors ABT-888 (veliparib) and AZD2281 (olaparib) markedly synergized with FdUrd but
not with 5-FU in ovarian cancer cell lines. Furthermore, ABT-888 synergized with FdUrd far more effectively than
other agents commonly used to treat ovarian cancer. These findings underscore differences in the cytotoxic
mechanisms of 5-FU and FdUrd and suggest that combining FdUrd and PARP inhibitors may be an innovative
therapeutic strategy for ovarian tumors. Cancer Res; 71(14); 4944–54. ’2011 AACR.

Introduction
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has activity in multiple neoplastic
diseases and is one of the most widely used chemotherapy
agents. 5-FU enters cells by facilitated transport and undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple active metabolites
[Fig. 1A, review in (1)]. On the one hand, 5-FU can be converted
to the ribonucleotide FUTP (5-fluorouridine triphosphate),
which exerts cytotoxic activity when it is incorporated into
RNAs by RNA polymerases. On the other hand, 5-FU also has
complex effects on DNA replication following its conversion to
the active metabolites FdUMP [5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd)
monophosphate] and FdUTP (5-FdUrd triphosphate).
Whereas FdUTP is incorporated directly into DNA, FdUMP
inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in depletion of dTTP,
accumulation of dUTP and its subsequent incorporation into

DNA, and disruption of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)
ratios.
In addition to being a metabolite of 5-FU, FdUrd (also
known as floxuridine) is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of hepatic colon metastases (2). Moreover, the drug has
activity in multiple cancers, including ovarian cancer (3–11).
Unlike 5-FU, however, FdUrd is generally believed to exert its
antiproliferative effects primarily through the disruption of
DNA replication (i.e., by inhibiting thymidylate synthase and/
or causing the incorporation of 5-FU into genomic DNA; ref.
12). Thus, in addition to being a useful clinical agent, FdUrd is
also frequently used by basic researchers as a means to
specifically focus on 5-FU's DNA-directed effects.
Nucleoside analogs, including 5-FU and FdUrd, disrupt
dNTP levels and are incorporated into DNA, 2 events that
stall DNA replication and activate ATR (13–22), an apical
kinase in the ATR checkpoint signaling pathway. Activated
ATR phosphorylates multiple substrates, including the kinase
Chk1. Collectively, ATR and Chk1 phosphorylate substrates
that promote cell survival by impeding cell-cycle progression,
orchestrating DNA repair and stabilizing stalled replication
forks (23). Notably, however, FdUrd and 5-FU also induce
double-stranded DNA breaks (24, 25), which activate the ATM
signaling pathway (26), including the ATM substrate checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2). Like the ATR pathway, the ATM pathway promotes survival of cells with double-stranded DNA
breaks by blocking cell-cycle progression and mobilizing DNA
repair machinery. Although both the ATR and ATM signaling
pathways are activated by 5-FU and FdUrd, the roles these

pathways play in regulating the survival of human tumors
treated with these agents have not been explored fully.
The genomically incorporated uracil (U) and 5-FU are also
targets of the base excision repair (BER) machinery (12). In
this repair pathway, nonbulky DNA lesions are first recognized
and cleaved by a DNA glycosylase, producing an abasic site,
which is further processed to a single-stranded DNA break by
an endonuclease activity such as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (27). The single-stranded DNA break attracts poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 or 2 (collectively referred to as
PARP), which subsequently poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself and
other proteins, leading to the binding of the scaffolding
protein XRCC1 and additional proteins required for completion of BER (28).
Despite our in-depth understanding of the BER machinery,
surprisingly little is known about how U and 5-FU DNA lesions
are processed in tumor cells treated with 5-FU or FdUrd.
Although there are 4 known uracil glycosylases—UNG,
SMUG1, TDG, and MBD4—that can excise these lesions in
vitro, it remains unclear what roles these glycosylases play in
human tumor cells (12). Similarly, the roles of the downstream
repair proteins remain poorly explored in human cells, particularly the role of PARP. Given that small molecule PARP

inhibitors are now in clinical development as single agents for
the treatment of tumors with defects in BRCA1-/BRCA2dependent repair or as sensitizers to other chemotherapy
agents (28), this question may be relevant for the development
of novel therapies that include PARP inhibitors.
Here, we have systematically explored the checkpoint and
DNA repair processes that are important in ovarian cancer
cells treated with 5-FU and FdUrd. Our studies show that 5-FU
and FdUrd have distinct mechanisms of action in these tumor
cells. Based on these findings, we have discovered that small
molecule PARP inhibitors synergize with FdUrd but not with
5-FU, raising the possibility that a combination of FdUrd and a
PARP inhibitor may have activity in ovarian cancer.

5% CO2 at 34 C in a 1:1 mixutre of M199:MCDB105 (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 mg/mL
hygromycin B. For clonogenic assays, the aforementioned
media were supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Mediatech). OVCAR-3 and WS1 cell
lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection,
which authenticated the lines by short tandem repeat profiling. OVCAR-5 and OVCAR-8 were gifts from D. Scudierio
[National Cancer Institute (NCI)]. SKOV3ip, A2780, and
OSEtsT/hTERT cells were gifts from V. Shridhar (Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, MN) and were genotyped shortly before acquisition. Every 3 months, all cell lines were reinitiated from
cryopreserved stocks prepared immediately after receipt from
the indicated sources.

For clonogenic assays using nontransfected cells, percent
survivals of all individual and combination treatments were
normalized to cells treated with vehicle only. For clonogenic
assays using cells transfected with siRNA, percent survivals at
each drug concentration were normalized to the vehicletreated control for the given siRNA. For MTS assays, 2,000
to 3,000 log-phase OSEtsT/hTERT or WS1 cells were plated in
96-well plates, and after 4 hours, the indicated concentrations
of ABT-888 and FdUrd were added. The plates were incubated
for 4 days and reacted with MTS and phenazine methosulfate
as instructed by the supplier for 2 to 3 hours, and absorbances
at 490 nm were determined. All percent cell viabilities were
normalized to controls treated with vehicle only. Annexin V
staining was done according to supplier's protocols. Cells were
irradiated with a RS-2000 Biological Irradiator, Rad Source, 4
to 6 hours after plating.

Results

Cell transfections and siRNAs
siRNAs (400 nmol/transfection) were mixed with 5  106 to
1  107 cells in 0.2 mL RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and electroporated
with two 10-ms, 280-V pulses in a BTX T820 square wave
electroporator (Harvard Apparatus). The transfected cells
were cultured for 48 hours before use. Sequences of siRNAs
were: ATM-1, 50 -AAGCACCAGTCCAGTATTGGC-30 (30); ATR2, 50 -CCTCCGTGATGTTGCTTGA-30 (31); XRCC1-2, 50 -CUCGACUCACUGUGCAGAAUU-30 (32); XRCC1-3, 50 -CCAGGAAGATATAGACATT-30 ; PARP1-1, 50 -AAGCCUCCGCUCCUGAACAAU-30 and PARP1-2, 50 -AAGAUAGAGCGUGAAGGCGAA-30
(33); and luciferase, 50 -CTTACGCUGAGUACUUCGA-30 (34).

ATR but not ATM is important for FdUrd toxicity
Activation of Chk1 and Chk2 suggests that signaling
through ATM and/or ATR, both of which affect the survival
of cells treated with multiple distinct genotoxins, may influence the toxicity of these agents. To assess how these kinases
impact 5-FU and FdUrd cytotoxicity, OVCAR-8 cells were
transfected with siRNAs that deplete ATM (ATM-1) and
ATR (ATR-2). These siRNAs showed no cytotoxicity on their
own (ATM siRNA–transfected cell plating efficiency ¼ 106.7 
4.3%, mean  SEM, n ¼ 4; ATR siRNA–transfected cell plating
efficiency ¼ 100.3  11.8%, n ¼ 5, compared with luciferase
siRNA-transfected cells) and did not affect formation of the
FdUMP-thymidylate synthase complex, indicating that they
did not alter uptake and/or metabolism of 5-FU and FdUrd
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Surprisingly, neither ATM nor ATR
depletion sensitized either cell line to 5-FU (Fig. 2A and B, left),
showing that even though the ATM and ATR pathways are
activated, they do not protect these cell lines from 5-FU.
Far different results were seen with FdUrd. Whereas ATM

5-FU and FdUrd activate checkpoint kinases
Previously published results have shown that antimetabolites, including 5-FU and FdUrd, activate checkpoint signaling
pathways (15–22, 37). Accordingly, we found that 5-FU and
FdUrd induced phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 in 2
ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR-8 (Fig. 1B) and SKOV3ip
(Fig. 1C). In the SKOV3ip cells, 5-FU induced Chk1 and Chk2
activation in 8 and 24 hours, with levels similar to those seen
with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU),
which was used as a positive control. In contrast, FdUrd
triggered modest and delayed Chk1 phosphorylation in these
cells. In OVCAR-8 cells, 5-FU induced delayed Chk1 and Chk2
activation, whereas FdUrd caused rapid Chk1 phosphorylation. Consistent with the observed effects on checkpoint
signaling, 5-FU and FdUrd induced phosphorylation of histone
H2AX (Fig. 1D), a marker of DNA damage (38). Taken together,
these results show that both fluoropyrimidines induce DNA
damage and activate the ATM and ATR checkpoint signaling
pathways.

depletion (which sensitized to ionizing radiation, Supplementary Fig. S1B) had no effect on FdUrd cytotoxicity, ATR
depletion profoundly sensitized the cells to FdUrd (Fig. 2A
and B, right; see Supplementary Fig. S2A for replotted data
highlighting the effects of low concentrations of FdUrd).
Furthermore, cells simultaneously depleted by ATM and
ATR were not more sensitive to FdUrd than cells depleted
only of ATR, indicating that even when ATR levels are severely
reduced, ATM does not affect FdUrd toxicity.
Depletion of XRCC1 and PARP1 enhances sensitivity to
FdUrd but not 5-FU
The results presented in Figure 2 indicated that disabling
checkpoint signaling affected the cytotoxicity of FdUrd but
not 5-FU, increasing the possibility that these agents may also
differ in their requirements for DNA repair. Because genomically incorporated U and 5-FU are substrates for the BER
pathway, we investigated the role of BER in the cytotoxicity of
these agents by depleting OVCAR-8 cells of XRCC1, a BER

5.3, mean  SEM, n ¼ 4; XRCC1-3 ¼ 81.2  10.3, n ¼ 3
compared with luciferase siRNA–transfected cells). Notably,
however, even after adjusting for the reduced plating efficiency, XRCC1 depletion with 2 different siRNAs sensitized to
FdUrd, whereas it did not affect 5-FU cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A; see
Supplementary Fig. S2B for alternate X-axis scale in Fig. 3A;
and Supplementary Fig. S2C for additional XRCC1 siRNA).
Similarly, depletion of PARP1 (which did not affect plating
efficiency; PARP1-1 ¼ 102.7  2.5, mean  SEM, n ¼ 3;
PARP1-2 ¼ 101.6  9.2, n ¼ 3, compared with luciferasetransfected cells) did not sensitize to 5-FU but did sensitize to
FdUrd (Fig. 3B; see Supplementary Fig. S2B for alternate X-axis
scale in Fig. 3B). These data indicate that BER is important in
ovarian cancer cells treated with FdUrd but not 5-FU. Furthermore, taken in conjunction with our checkpoint signaling
studies (Fig. 2), they are consistent with the idea that 5-FU
does not kill these cells by inflicting DNA damage.

Small-molecule PARP inhibitors potentiate the
antiproliferative activity of FdUrd but not 5-FU
Given that PARP1 depletion increased the cytotoxicity of
FdUrd, we reasoned that small-molecule inhibitors of PARP
would affect the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to this
agent. Continuous exposure to either AZD2281 (olaparib) or
ABT-888 (veliparib), 2 PARP inhibitors currently in clinical
trials, had minimal effects on the cloning efficiency as single
agents, with 3 mmol/L ABT-888 reducing the surviving fraction
to 90.3  2.4% (mean  SEM, n ¼ 12). In contrast, both PARP
inhibitors markedly increased killing when cells were coexposed to FdUrd and the PARP inhibitor for 24 hours (Fig. 4A,
left), followed by continuous treatment with the PARP inhibitor. No such increase in cytotoxicity was seen with 5-FU and
PARP inhibitor coexposure (Fig. 4A, right).
To explore the effects of ABT-888 when cells are exposed to
lower concentrations of FdUrd and 5-FU for extended periods,
OVCAR-8 cells were treated with FdUrd or 5-FU plus ABT-888
for the duration of the clonogenic assay (8 days). As shown in
Figure 4B, the concentrations of 5-FU and FdUrd that inhibited proliferation by 50% (IC50) were reduced when cells were
continuously exposed to these agents and were similar to the

4948

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

IC50s of colon cancer cell lines that have been extensively
studied with these fluoropyrmidines (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Importantly, by using this exposure paradigm, ABT-888 also
potentiated the effects of FdUrd but not 5-FU in OVCAR-8
(Fig. 4B) and SKOV3ip cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Further
experiments showed that even when the clonogenic assays
were done with dialyzed fetal bovine serum, which lacks
thymidine and therefore enhances 5-FU's DNA-directed cytotoxicity (39), ABT-888 still did not increase cell killing by 5-FU
(Supplementary Fig. S4B), further showing that 5-FU does not
exert its antiproliferative effects by causing DNA damage in
these cells. In addition, as was seen with the siRNAs employed
earlier, treatment with the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 did not
alter formation of the FdUMP-thymidylate synthase complex
in response to treatment with 5-FU and FdUrd (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Given that cells treated continuously with 3 mmol/L ABT-888
had modestly reduced survival compared with vehicle-treated
control cells, we next asked whether the cytotoxicity of ABT888 and FdUrd was synergistic. OVCAR-8 cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of FdUrd plus the indicated
concentrations of ABT-888 for 24 hours (Fig. 4C, left). After

readded to the cultures, which were incubated until colonies
formed. From these data, we conducted a formal analysis of
synergy using the median effect method of Chou and Talalay
(40), assuming that the agents were mutually exclusive. This
analysis revealed that the combination indices for all the data
points were far below 1 (Fig. 4C, right), thus indicating strong
synergistic killing over a wide range of concentrations.
Of final note, these studies showed that ABT-888 concentrations as low as 0.3 mmol/L synergized with FdUrd, with
higher ABT-888 concentrations even more effectively enhancing FdUrd-induced cytotoxicity. Notably, in human phase 0
clinical trials, peak plasma concentrations of ABT-888 were 0.6
and 0.9 mmol/L for patients treated with a single oral dose of

25 or 50 mg ABT-888, respectively (41), thus showing that
concentrations of ABT-888 achieved in human serum following a single dose of ABT-888 synergize with FdUrd.
ABT-888 prevents recovery from FdUrd-induced cellcycle arrest and promotes FdUrd-induced apoptosis
To further understand the effects of these agents on cells,
we examined how ABT-888 alone, FdUrd alone, and the
combination of these 2 agents (FdUrdþABT-888) influenced
the cell cycle of OVCAR-8 cells. Identical culture plates were
exposed for 24 hours to ABT-888 alone, FdUrd alone, or
the combination (FdUrdþABT-888), washed, and refed with
medium or with medium containing ABT-888 (for cells that
were initially exposed to ABT-888). Plates were then harvested

24 or 48 hours. ABT-888 alone had no effect on the cell cycle
at any time point (Fig. 5A). In contrast, 24-hour exposure to
FdUrd alone caused a late S/early G1–phase arrest. Following
removal of the FdUrd, the late S/early G1–phase–arrested cells
moved synchronously through S phase and into G2–M. Similarly, 24-hour exposure to FdUrdþABT-888 caused a late S/
early G1–phase arrest. However, following removal of the
FdUrd (and in the continued presence of ABT-888), the cells
accumulated in early S phase and in G2–M. In addition, at the
48-hour time point, cells with sub-G1 levels of DNA appeared,
suggesting that the cells were undergoing apoptosis. Indeed,
more than 40% of the cells treated with FdUrdþABT-888 were
Annexin V-positive, another marker for apoptotic cells, at the
48-hour time point (Fig. 5B), with near-background numbers
of Annexin V-positive cells in all other treated samples. Taken
together, these results show that although ABT-888 does not
affect cell-cycle progression in untreated cells, this PARP

inhibitor dramatically slows the progression of cells with
FdUrd-induced lesions and promotes apoptosis.
ABT-888 is most effective when present during and
after the FdUrd exposure
For the experiments shown in Figure 4, ABT-888 was
present during and after the FdUrd exposure period. However,
it was unclear when ABT-888 exposure would most effectively
synergize with FdUrd. We therefore compared a series of
FdUrd and ABT-888 exposure schemes (Fig. 5C). Modestly
increased cytotoxicity was observed when OVCAR-8 cells
were exposed to FdUrd and ABT-888 simultaneously for
24 hours (sequence II; Fig. 5D), compared with FdUrd alone
(sequence I). Similarly, exposure to FdUrd alone for 24 hours
followed by continuous incubation with ABT-888 modestly
increased cytotoxicity over FdUrd alone (sequence III). In
contrast, the most robust killing was seen with sequences
IV and V in which cells were simultaneously exposed to FdUrd

Mechanism-Guided Identification of Novel Drug Combination

and ABT-888, followed by continuous ABT-888 treatment after
FdUrd removal.
PARP inhibition synergizes with FdUrd in multiple
ovarian cancer cell lines but not in normal cells
To determine whether FdUrd and ABT-888 synergized in
other ovarian cancer cell lines, we assessed these agents in the
ovarian cancer cell lines A2780, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5, and
SKOV3ip. ABT-888 robustly potentiated the activity of FdUrd
in A2780, OVCAR-3, and SKOV3ip cells, with modest effects
seen in OVCAR-5 cells (Fig. 6A). Formal analyses of synergy
showed that this killing was synergistic across a wide range of
concentrations in the A2780, OVCAR3, and SKOV3ip cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5A). In contrast, ABT-888 did not alter
the cytotoxicity of FdUrd in OSEtsT/hTERT (29), which are
immortalized nontransformed ovarian surface epithelial cells,
or in WS1 cells (Fig. 6B), normal human fibroblasts that
undergo a limited number of replications (42).
Comparison of FdUrd plus ABT-888 with other
chemotherapy plus ABT-888 combinations
PARP inhibition has been reported to sensitize tumor cells
to multiple chemotherapy agents (28). We therefore evaluated
the relative ability of ABT-888 to sensitize to various therapies

www.aacrjournals.org

that are used in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Consistent
with published results, ABT-888 sensitized OVCAR-8 cells to
the topoisomerase I poison topotecan (Fig. 7; ref. 28). Similarly, ABT-888 modestly increased the antiproliferative effect
of the nitrogen mustard melphalan. In contrast, ABT-888 did
not sensitize to the platinating agents, cisplatin, oxaliplatin,
and carboplatin; the anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin; the
nucleoside analog gemcitabine; the topoisomerase II poison
etoposide; or the antimitotic agent vinorelbine (Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Fig. S5B). As a control, we also assessed the
effects of ABT-888 on temozolomide, an alkylating agent that
induces lesions repaired by BER (43). Notably, due to the
profound sensitizing effect of ABT-888 to temozolomide (28),
multiple clinical trials combining ABT-888 with temozolomide
are now underway (44). In this head-to-head comparison,
ABT-888 sensitized these cells to FdUrd as effectively as it
sensitized to temozolomide (Fig. 7, compare upper left with
lower right).

Discussion
Despite intense study for more than 5 decades, it remains
unclear whether 5-FU exerts cytotoxicity primarily by disrupting DNA replication (via inhibition of thymidylate synthase

Figure 7. ABT-888 sensitizes to FdUrd and temozolomide more effectively than to other chemotherapy agents. OVCAR-8 cells were treated with
indicated concentrations of FdUrd, topotecan, melphalan, cisplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, etoposide, and temozolomide in the presence or absence
of 3 mmol/L ABT-888 for 24 hours. Following washing, ABT-888 was readded to samples initially exposed to ABT-888, and cells were cultured until colonies
formed. Data shown are a representative experiment from 2 independent replicates. n ¼ 3  SD. Experiments with FdUrd, topotecan, melphalan, and
temozolomide were independently replicated 3 times.

and/or nucleotide misincorporation) or by incorporation into
RNA in human tumor cell lines. In the present article, we
have systematically assessed the roles of the ATR and ATM
checkpoint signaling pathways and BER to understand how
5-FU kills ovarian cancer cells with the long-term goal of
identifying novel therapies for this disease. Our results show
that although 5-FU activates both the ATR and ATM checkpoint signaling pathways and causes DNA damage (as indicated by phosphorylation of H2AX), these pathways do not
affect the survival of cells treated with 5-FU. Similarly, our
studies of the BER pathway showed that disrupting this
repair pathway by depleting XRCC1 or disabling PARP1
(with siRNA depletion or small-molecule inhibition) did
not sensitize these cell lines to 5-FU. Taken together, these
results suggest that even though 5-FU is causing DNA
damage, its primary cytotoxic effect is due to the disruption
of a different cellular process, which most likely depends on
the incorporation of 5-FU into RNA.
Our results on the roles of the checkpoint signaling pathways in 5-FU–treated ovarian cancer cells differ from findings
reported in cell lines derived from other types of cancer. In
these previously published studies, disruption of ATR or Chk1
sensitized RKO, SW620, HCT116 parental, and p53/ HCT116
cells (derived from colon cancer), Panc-1 (derived from pancreatic cancer), and HeLa cells (derived from endometrial
cancer) to 5-FU (17, 21, 22, 37, 45). In contrast, we found that
depletion of ATR alone, ATM alone, or even simultaneous
ATM and ATR depletion did not sensitize either cell line to 5FU. Given that in the same experiments, the ATM depletion

4952

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

effectively sensitized to ionizing radiation (Supplementary
Fig. S1B) and that ATR depletion dramatically sensitized to
FdUrd (Fig. 2A and B), it is unlikely that our results are
explained by insufficient depletion of these checkpoint
kinases. Instead, our findings suggest that unknown molecular
differences among these cell lines may underlie these divergent findings.
In contrast to our findings with 5-FU, our studies with
FdUrd found that depletion of ATR, XRCC1, and PARP1
sensitized OVCAR-8 cells to FdUrd, consistent with observations that FdUrd primarily exerts its antiproliferative effects
in human cells by disrupting DNA replication (12). Nonetheless, our results differ from some of the published findings in rodent cells treated with FdUrd. Mouse embryo
fibroblasts lacking DNA polymerase ß (Polb/ cells), a
polymerase that participates in the final steps of short-patch
BER, and XRCC1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells were
not more sensitive to FdUrd (12), suggesting that BER was
not important for repair of the lesions induced by FdUrd. In
contrast, McNiell and colleagues (46) found that expression
of a catalytically inactive dominant negative APE1 mutant
sensitized Chinese hamster ovary cells to FdUrd. Consistent
with the latter result, we found that BER plays a critical role
in the repair of FdUrd-inflicted lesions in human ovarian
cancer cells.
Our finding that XRCC1 and PARP1 depletion sensitized
ovarian cancer cells to FdUrd immediately suggested that
small-molecule PARP inhibitors might also sensitize these cell
lines to FdUrd. Indeed, both ABT-888 and AZD2281 robustly

potentiated the antiproliferative activity of FdUrd in multiple
ovarian cancer cell lines. Because ovarian cancer afflicts more
than 22,000 women and kills more than 16,000 women yearly
in the United States (47), new therapeutic options are needed.
Given that (i) FdUrd has activity against ovarian cancer in
clinical trials as a single agent, (ii) ABT-888 sensitizes to FdUrd
more effectively than to other drugs often used to treat
ovarian cancer, and (iii) the FdUrd plus ABT-888 combination
effectively kills multiple ovarian cancer cell lines, our findings
suggest that further preclinical studies that combine these
agents are warranted.
