Abstract
Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1, which promotes the progression of
malignancy by stimulating angiogenesis and by augmenting the ability of tumors to
survive. Thus, HIF-1 is one of the most compelling targets for treating cancers. The
aim of this study was to find a small molecule that inhibits HIF-1 under hypoxia in
cancer cells. 7,280 compounds in a chemical library were tested in a cancer cell line
expressing luciferase HIF-dependently. Through three rounds of screening, we finally
picked up a compound that originates from a marine bacterium parasitizing red alga.
The antibiotic potently inhibited HIF-1 expression and its transcriptional activity in
cancer cells exposed to hypoxia. Through two-step fractionation, diacetoxyscirpenol
was purified and identified as a HIF-inhibiting ingredient. Mechanistically,
diacetoxyscirpenol inhibits the synthesis of HIF-1α protein and also interferes with
the dimerization of HIF-1α and ARNT. It attenuates HIF-mediated gene expression in
cancer cells exposed to hypoxia, and by doing so reduces tumorigenic and angiogenic
potentials of cancer cells. More importantly, diacetoxyscirpenol retarded tumor growth
in mice, and reduced HIF-1α expression and vascular formation in the tumors. Overall,
diacetoxyscirpenol is considered a potential drug deregulating the HIF-1 signaling
pathway, and it could be beneficially employed for treating malignant tumors with
hypoxic microenvironment.

Introduction

DNA. Briefly reviewing the oxygen-dependent regulation
of HIF-1α, HIF-1α is hydroxylated oxygen-dependently at
two proline residues under normoxia, which triggers the
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α.
When the ambient oxygen content drops below the level
critical for the prolyl-hydroxylation, HIF-1α is stabilized
and enters into the nucleus, where it targets 100 or more
genes [5–7].
To date, the roles of HIF-1 in tumor progression
have been intensively explored and HIF-1α is generally
regarded as a tumor promoting factor. The expression
of HIF-1 in tumor specimens positively correlates with
tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis [8]. Also,
many tumor grafting studies have supported the positive

Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors and
plays crucial roles for tumor progression and angiogenesis
[1, 2]. To survive under a hypoxic microenvironment,
cancer cells require the activation of many genes essential
for their adaptation to the condition, which is mainly
driven by the transcription factor HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible
factor 1) [3]. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric complex composed
of HIF-1α and ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
translocator), both of which belong to the basic helixloop-helix PAS family [4]. HIF-1α is a hypoxia-inducible
protein that plays a primary role in gene expression and
ARNT is a constitutive protein that assists HIF-α bind to

effects of HIF-1 on tumorigenesis, tumor growth, and
tumor invasion [9]. Given clinical and experimental
evidence, HIF-1 has been believed as a promising
target for treating tumors. Indeed, many types of HIF1 inhibitors have been discovered, and some of them
are currently under clinical trials. HIF-1 inhibitors
act through various mode-of-actions as followings.
Bortezomib, nutlin-3, and echinomycin functionally
inhibit the HIF-1-mediated gene expressions [10–12].
HSP90 inhibitors, microtubule disruptors, and YC-1
destabilize HIF-1α in the post-translational level [13–
15]. Several agents, such as topotecan, digoxin, PX-478,
rapamycin, and chaetocin, have been reported to block de
novo synthesis of HIF-1α protein [16–20].
The aim of this study was to find a small molecule
that inhibits HIF-1 under hypoxia in cancer cells. A human
hepatoma cell line, which stably expresses the luciferase
reporter gene targeted by HIF-1, was established and
used for searching for HIF-1 inhibitors in a chemical
library containing 7,280 compounds. Finally, we picked
up a compound that originates from a marine bacterium
living on red alga, and identified this compound as
diacetoxyscirpenol. Moreover, we examined how the
compound inhibits HIF-1 and whether it has anti-cancer
and anti-angiogenic activities.

separated the extract into 40 fractions. Of them, we picked
up the fraction 26 because it inhibited HIF-1 activity by
> 85% (Figure 1B) and was also not significantly toxic
(Figure 1C). The effects of the fractions against HIF-1
were rechecked by evaluating the HIF-1α protein level
using Western blotting. As was expected, HIF-1α protein
was not detected under normoxia but was notably induced
under hypoxia. We also found that the fraction 26 at
100 ng·mL-1 attenuated the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α
almost completely (Figure 1D). Since the fraction 26 was
not a single compound, we further separated the fraction
26 into 13 fractions using LH-20 column chromatography.
Consequently, the 7th fraction of the fraction 26, which
is designated #26-7, was identified not only to inhibit
HIF-1 activity even at 10 ng·mL-1 but also to be less
toxic (Figure 2A and 2B). A Western blotting showed
that #26-7 suppressed HIF-1α expression very effectively
(Figure 2C).

Anti-HIF effects of #26-7 in different cancer cell
lines

We established the stable Hep3B cell line that
expresses luciferase HIF-1-dependently under hypoxia and
searched for anti-HIF-1 compounds, as was summarized
in Figure 1A. We first checked chemiluminescence
emitting form the cells which had been incubated at 1%
oxygen with DMSO or each (finally 5 μg·mL-1) of 7,280
compounds in a chemical library for 16 hours. From the
first-round screening, we picked up 166 candidates. To
rule out the possibility that luciferase expression is nonspecifically impaired due to toxicity, we checked whether
the candidates at 5 mg·mL-1 were not toxic (less than 20%
cell death) using MTT analysis. From the second-round
screening, 27 compound were selected as HIF-1 inhibitors.
To further search for potent inhibitors, we reevaluated the
anti-HIF-1 effects of 27 candidates at a concentration of
1 mg·mL-1 and picked up three candidates. Finally, we
selected the most potent compound “BHS-A503” that
inhibited HIF-1 at < 100 ng·mL-1. The compound was an
unrefined extract from Bacillus licheniformis, which is
parasitic on red alga Gelidium pacificum.

We next examined whether #26-7 has anti-HIF
activity in cancer cells other than Hep3B. #26-7 suppressed
HIF-1α expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it
did not substantially affect ARNT expression (Figure 3A,
the 1st and 2nd rows). Likewise, #26-7 also effectively
suppressed HIF-1α expression in HCT116 and MKN cells
(Figure 3B). Apparently, the efficacy of #26-7 on HIF-1α
inhibition appears to be similar among three cell lines.
In the EPO enhancer reporter assay, #26-7 was found
to inhibit the HIF-1 driven transcription under hypoxia
(Figure 3C). To examine whether #26-7 regulates the
cellular response to hypoxia, we analyzed mRNAs of the
HIF target genes in A549 cells. The hypoxic induction
of LOX, CA9, CyclinD1, and CITED2 mRNAs was
substantially attenuated by #26-7 (Figure 3D). Using [α]D,
LR-EI-MS, and NMR (1H, 13C, DEPT) analyses, #26-7
was identify as diacetoxyscirpenol [21]. Its structure is
illustrated in Figure 4A. First, we compared the toxicity
of the purchased diacetoxyscirpenol in A549 and two
normal cell-lines. Even at the higher concentrations of
diacetoxyscirpenol, no significant differences in toxicity
were observed among the cell-lines (Figure 4B). Given
that this reagent also inhibited the expression and activity
of HIF-1/2α (Figure 4C and 4D), diacetoxyscirpenol
was considered an HIF-inhibiting ingredient included in
#26-7. Compared with a known HIF-1 inhibitor 17AAG,
diacetoxyscirpenol was shown to be more potent in HIF-1
inhibition (Figure 4E).

HIF-1α degradation was induced by reoxygenation
after the protein was accumulated under hypoxia
(Figure 5A) or by cycloheximide treatment after it was
stabilized using a HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor,
dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) (Figure 5B). However,
the rate of HIF-1α degradation was not facilitated in the
presence of diacetoxyscirpenol, suggesting no effect of
diacetoxyscirpenol on HIF-1α stability. Next, we analyzed de
novo synthesis of HIF-1α using MG132, which can induce
the accumulation of newly synthesized HIF-1α protein
by blocking protein degradation. Strikingly, the synthesis
of HIF-1α protein was abolished by diacetoxyscirpenol
(Figure 5B). To further examine the mechanism underlying
the blockade of HIF-1α synthesis, we measured the mRNA

levels of HIF-1α, but diacetoxyscirpenol did not inhibit the
transcription of HIF-1α (Figure 5C), which encouraged us to
analyze the translation of HIF-1α. The translation of HIF-1α
mRNA is initiated through two pathways, 5ʹ cap-dependent
translation and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)dependent translation, both of which are determined by the
5ʹ-UTR of HIF-1α mRNA [22]. We analyzed the activities of
two luciferase reporters reflecting each pathway of HIF-1α
translation. Consequently, diacetoxyscirpenol inhibited both
the pathways of HIF-1α translation, whereas it did not affect
the activity of TK promoter without the 5ʹ-UTR (Figure 5D).
Diacetoxyscirpenol seems to inhibit de novo synthesis of
HIF-1α protein by blocking the 5ʹ-UTR-mediated translation
of HIF-1α mRNA.

To rule out other actions of diacetoxyscirpenol on
oxygen-dependent HIF-1 regulation, we examined if it
affects the HIF-1α hydroxylation by PHD enzymes or
the HIF-1α ubiquitination/degradation by the pVHL-E3
complex. However, diacetoxyscirpenol suppressed HIF-1α
expression even in the presence of DMOG and also in
VHL-null RCC4 cells (Figure 6A and 6B). These findings
further support our notion that diacetoxyscirpenol does
not affect the degradation process of HIF-1α. To get its

functionality as a transcription factor, HIF-1α should
dimerize with ARNT in the nucleus. Interestingly,
diacetoxyscirpenol interfered with the dimerization of
HIF-1α and ARNT (Figure 6C), which may be attributed
to impaired nuclear translocation of HIF-1α. The level of
nuclear HIF-1α was cross-checked using immunoblotting
(Figure 6D) and immunofluorescence (Figure 6E).
Collectively, diacetoxyscirpenol seem to attenuate HIF-1
signaling in two different ways.

by diacetoxyscirpenol in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 7B). We next investigated if diacetoxyscirpenol
attenuates the angiogenic potential of cancer cells
because HIF-1α plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis
[2, 25]. Diacetoxyscirpenol substantially inhibited
VEGF secretion from A549 cells in either normoxic
or hypoxic conditions (Figure 8A). As expected,
diacetoxyscirpenol attenuated the hypoxic induction
of VEGF mRNA (Figure 8B). To check the angiogenic
potential of A549 cells, tube formation of HUVECs was
analyzed in the presence of A549-driven conditioned
media. Endothelial tube formation was augmented
by the conditioned media from A549 cells exposed
to hypoxia. However, in the conditioned media from
A549 cells treated with diacetoxyscirpenol, the tube
formation was significantly reduced (Figure 8C). To test
the possibility that diacetoxyscirpenol per se inhibits the
endothelial tube formation, the compound was separately
administered into the endothelial culture plates containing
conditioned media from hypoxic A549 cells. Given that
the tube formation was attenuated by diacetoxyscirpenol
(Figure 8D), diacetoxyscirpenol is also likely to have a
direct effect against vascular formation. These results
suggest that diacetoxyscirpenol inhibits tumorigenic and
angiogenic potentials of cancer cells under hypoxia.

mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma. When tumor volume
reached about 100 mm3, mice were intraperitoneally
injected with DMSO (vehicle) or diacetoxyscirpenol. No
substantial changes in gross appearance and body weight
suggest that diacetoxyscirpenol at the used dose is not
highly toxic (Figure 9A). Diacetoxyscirpenol retarded
tumor growth (Figure 9A), and excised tumors were
noticeably smaller in diacetoxyscirpenol-treated mice than
in vehicle-treated mice (Figure 9B). HIF-1α and Ki-67 (a
marker for cell proliferation) were less expressed, and
vessels were poorly developed in tumor specimens from
diacetoxyscirpenol-treated mice (Figure 9C and 9D). The
HIF-1α suppression by diacetoxyscirpenol was confirmed
by immunoblotting HIF-1α in tumor homogenates
(Figure 9E). These results suggest that diacetoxyscirpenol
attenuates cancer cell proliferation by impairing tumor
adaptation to hypoxic microenvironment. However, given
that the numbers of TUNEL-stained apoptotic cells were
not different between two groups, this agent may not kill
cancer cells directly.

Discussion
To find a new anticancer small molecule to target
HIF-1, we performed the high-throughput screening
using a luciferase reporter system reflecting HIF-driven
transcription, and finally selected a marine bacterial
extract based on high potency on HIF inhibition and
less cytotoxicity. Through two fractionation processes
of the extract, diacetoxyscirpenol was purified and
identified as an active ingredient having anti-HIF activity.

Mechanistically, diacetoxyscirpenol repressed HIF-1 by
inhibiting either HIF-1α translation or its dimerization
with ARNT. Furthermore, diacetoxyscirpenol blunted
HIF-mediated induction of hypoxic genes, and by doing
so attenuated anchorage-independent colony formation,
endothelial tube formation, and tumor growth in mice.
Therefore, we propose that diacetoxyscirpenol be a
potential anticancer agent targeting HIF-1.
To search for compounds inhibiting the HIF-1
signaling pathway, we performed two different methods
to evaluate this pathway, namely, the HRE-luciferase
reporter and Western blotting for HIF-1α. However, as
shown in Figure 1B and 1D and in Figure 2A and 2C,
the results from the two analyses were somewhat missmatched with each other. Actually, the functionality
of HIF-1 is determined by diverse factors other than
the amount of HIF-1α protein. For instance, HIF-1α is
modified (i.e., hydroxylated, phosphorylated, sumoylated,
and neddyated), and interacts with many proteins, thereby
modulating the HIF-1 activity [26, 27]. The discrepancies
between the results from two analyses may be attributed
to the post-translation regulations of HIF-1α. Therefore,
we chose the compounds that inhibited HIF-1 at both the
analyses.
Diacetoxyscirpenol
contains
the
12,13-epoxytrichothecene group of sesquiterpenes
as the core structure. It has been known as one of
harmful metabolites produced from plant parasitic fungi
belonging to Fusarium species [28]. Accidently, people
or livestock have been subjected to food poisoning by
diacetoxyscirpenol which contaminated agricultural
crops, such as grains, potatoes, peas, soybeans [29].
However, diacetoxyscirpenol has been rarely reported to
contaminate sea plants. Surprisingly, diacetoxyscirpenol
was found to be also contained in a marine bacterium
parasitizing red alga, suggesting that diacetoxyscirpenol
probably cause food poisoning derived by sea foods. For
keeping sea foods safe, it may be recommended to check
the contamination of diacetoxyscirpenol.
Diacetoxyscirpenol and its analogues were
developed as anti-cancer agents because it inhibited
cell cycle progression and cell survival [30].
Diacetoxyscirpenol was also reported to potentiate the
anti-cancer effect of cisplatin [31]. However, the clinical
trial of diacetoxyscirpenol for cancer treatment was
ceased at the phase II because it induced intolerable side
effects, such as nausea, vomiting, fever, hypertension,
and confusion [32, 33]. Nonetheless, we argue that
diacetoxyscirpenol can be repositioned as an anti-HIF
agent. Compared to the concentrations (> 100 nM) of
diacetoxyscirpenol used to kill cancer cells directly [34],
a lower concentration (< 5 nM) of diacetoxyscirpenol
was found in our experiments to inhibit HIF-1. Indeed,
cell viability was not substantially decreased by
diacetoxyscirpenol at this concentration. If its dose is
readjusted to a HIF-inhibiting level, diacetoxyscirpenol is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expected to come out as a potential drug that specifically
blocks hypoxia-triggered, malignant cancer behaviors,
such as angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance.
Diacetoxyscirpenol was shown to block the hypoxiainduced production of VEGF, which is a target gene of
HIF-1. VEGF does not only drives angiogenesis but also
acts as a cell survival factor, which is why VEGF inhibitors
have been widely used as anti-cancer drugs. For example,
bevacizumab interferes with VEGF binding to the VEGF
receptors by sequestering VEGF, and inhibitors of VEGF
receptor tyrosine kinase block the signaling pathway of the
VEGF receptors [35, 36]. Diacetoxyscirpenol inhibited the
VEGF secretion from cancer cells under hypoxia, thereby
inhibiting the endothelial tube formation. Although it does
not directly target endothelial cells, diacetoxyscirpenol
may indirectly inhibit tumor-driven angiogenesis at least
under hypoxic microenvironment.
Some anti-angiogenic agents, mostly in combination
with conventional therapeutics, have been shown to have
anticancer activity in preclinical and clinical studies
[37]. However, the pros and cons of anti-angiogenic
agents have been debated so far. In some preclinical
studies, co-administration of anti-angiogenic agents was
shown to aggravate tumor hypoxia and also to impair
the delivery of cancer cell-targeting drugs, leading to
acquired resistance to chemotherapy [38]. By contrast,
beneficial actions of anti-angiogenic agents in combination
therapies have been also suggested. These agents may
improve oxygen and drug delivery within tumors through
normalization of irregular tumor vessels [39]. Since
the anti-angiogenic action of diacetoxyscirpenol may
contribute to its anticancer effect, this conflicting point
should be considered in developing diacetoxyscirpenol as
an adjuvant cancer drug.
In conclusion, we found that diacetoxyscirpenol
deregulates tumor adaptation to hypoxia by deregulating
HIF-1α. To our best knowledge, diacetoxyscirpenol is for
the first time identified to inhibit HIF-1. More importantly,
it is possible that diacetoxyscirpenol is used as a HIF-1
inhibitor at a lesser dose than its cytotoxic dose. If a low
dose of diacetoxyscirpenol is limitedly used for the purpose
of preventing HIF-mediated tumor progression or drug
resistance, it may be worthwhile reevaluating this agent as
an adjuvant cancer drug.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
Hep3B (hepatoma), A549 (lung cancer), HCT116
(colon cancer), MKN (gastric cancer), RCC4/VHL-/(renal cancer), and LLC1 (mouse lung cancer) cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Minimum
Essential Media, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium,
or RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
62118

Oncotarget

FBS. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at
37ᵒC under 20% O2/5% CO2 for normoxia or 1% O2/5%
CO2 hypoxia. For transient transfection, cells at about
40% confluence were transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamin 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
Cells were allowed to stabilize for 48 hours before being
used in experiments.

(CGTG to AAAA). Hep3B cells were transfected with
1 mg of the reporter plasmid using Lipofectamin 2000
(Life Technologies). After stabilized for 48 hours, the
Hep3B cell lines stably harboring the reporter plasmid
were selected under G418, and five stable cell lines were
mixed to rule out the artifact generated by the integration
of the plasmid into chromosomes. The cell line was pretreated with each compound in a chemical library for
4 hours, and then incubated under normoxia or hypoxia
for 16 hours. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity
was measured using a LB960 luminometer (Berthold
Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). To evaluate the capdependent and the IRES-dependent translation of HIF-1α
mRNA, we used thymidine kinase (TK) promoter/HIF1α 5′-UTR/luciferase and CMV promoter/GFP/HIF-1α
5′-UTR/luciferase reporters, respectively [41]. The
β-gal expression plasmid was cotransfected into cells to
normalize transfection efficiency.

Reagents and antibodies
Diacetoxyscirpenol was purchased from LKT
laboratories (Saint Paul, MN), and 17AAG and DMOG
from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St Louis, MO). Anti-HIF-2α
(#7096) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA), and antibodies against ARNT
(sc-8076), β-tubulin (sc-9104) and lamin-B (sc-6216) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HIF-1α
antiserum was generated in rabbits against a bacterially
expressed fragment encompassing amino acids 418 to 698
of human HIF-1α, as described previously [40].

Cell viability assays

Chemical library and fractionation of marine
bacterial metabolites

An MTT labeling reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MI) was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. Cells were plated in
24-well dishes and cultured in 0.5 ml of medium per well.
After cells were treated with each compound for 24 hours,
cells were incubated with 5 mg·mL-1 of MTT for 3 hours.
Blue formazan crystals were solubilized with acidified
isopropanol, and formazan levels were determined at 570
nm using a spectrophotometer.

A chemical library containing 7,280 compounds
was kindly provided by Korea Chemical Bank (Daejeon,
Korea; http://www.chembank.org/). A bacterial strain
Bacillus licheniformis was isolated from the marine red
alga Gelidium pacificum collected at Geomun Island in
South Korea, and identified based on 18S rRNA analyses
(performed in SolGent Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea).
The bacterium was cultured in 20 L of culture medium
consisting of soytone (0.1%), soluble starch (1.0%), and
seawater (100%). The cultures were incubated at 29°C for
20 days on the static condition. The whole culture was
filtered through cheesecloth to yield broth and mycelium
residue, and the resulted broth were extracted with
EtOAc to afford broth extract (1.1 g). The broth extract
was subjected to silica gel flash column chromatography.
Elution was performed with n-hexane-EtOAc (stepwise,
0–100% EtOAc) to yield eight fractions. Fraction
5 (15.5 mg) displayed HIF activity, and was further
purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using
n-hexane-EtOAc (stepwise, 10–100% EtOAc) to give
crude diacetoxyscirpenol (8.0 mg), which was finally
purified by LH-20 column chromatography (MeOH) to
furnish diacetoxyscirpenol (1.5 mg).

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
Total proteins were separated on an SDS
polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in a 0.1% Tween-20/Trisbuffered saline (TTBS) at room temperature for 1 hour,
and sequentially incubated overnight at 4ᵒC with a primary
antibody (1:1000) and with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 hour. The
immune complexes were visualized using an Enhanced
Chemiluminescence Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). The intensities of HIF-1/2α blots were
quantified using ImageJ program v1.31 (NIH, Bethesda,
MD) and normalized to β-tubulin levels. Data from 3
independent experiments were compared statistically. To
analyze the interaction between HIF-1α and ARNT, cell
lysates were incubated with anti-HIF-1α antibody for
4 hours, and further incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose
beads (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Westborough, MA) at
4ᵒC for 2 hours. Co-precipitated ARNT was identified by
immunoblotting with anti-ARNT antibody.

Reporter assays
To construct the EPO enhancer-driven luciferase
reporter gene, the human EPO enhancer region
(5-GGTACCGGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCACACAGCCT
GTCTGACCTCTCGACCTACCGGCCAGATCT-3) was
inserted into the multi-cloning site of the pGL4 vector
(Promega, Madison, WI). Mutated EPO luciferase was
generated by altering the DNA sequence targeted by HIF-1

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
at a density of 2 × 104 were seeded into each well and
incubated with 0.5 mL of MEDIUM 199 (Sigma-Aldrich)
containing 1% FBS. After stabilized, cells were incubated
in the conditioned media driven by A549 cells for 16 hours.
Images were captured with OLYMPUS camera attached

minutes, washed twice with PBS, blocked with 5% FBS,
and incubated with anti-HIF-1α antibody for 16 hours.
The cells were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody
conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488 for 1 hour, and their
nuclei were stained with 30 µM DAPI for 5 minutes.
Finally, the cells were mounted with the Fluorescence
Mounting Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) and photographed under a fluorescence microscope.

Secreted VEGF assay

Animals and tumor grafts

A549 cell was treated with a compound under
normoxia and hypoxia for 24 hours. VEGF released from
cells was analyzed in medium using the human VEGF
ELISA kit provided by Life Technologies. The VEGF
levels were calculated based on the standard curve using a
recombinant human VEGF165. Each assay was triplicate
to reduce the intra-assay error.

Male nude mice (BALB/cAnNCrj-nu/nu) were
purchased from Charles River Japan (Shin-Yokohama,
Japan) and housed in a specific pathogen-free room. Mice
(11 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously in a flask
with 1 × 106 LLC1 cells. After tumor volumes reached
over 100 mm3, mice were intraperitoneally injected with
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or DAS (1 mg kg-1) once a
day. Tumor volumes were measured with a caliper and
calculated using the equation “a × b2/2”, where ‘a’ is the
maximal width and ‘b’ is maximal orthogonal width. All
animal procedures were performed in accordance with a
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (Approve #SNU-141008-1).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed, and realtime polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed
in 96-well optical plates. Data were analyzed using CFX
Manager Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA),
and values were normalized to β-actin. The sequences (5ʹ
to 3ʹ) of primers are ACCAAGGGACATCAGATTTC &
GTAGCCATAGTCACAGGATG for lysyl oxidase (LOX);
GGAAGAAAACAGTGCCTATG & GTGTAGTCAGAG
ACCCCTCA for carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9); ACCC
ACCTCCCTTATGTAGT & CCAACTAATGCAATTT
TTCC for CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with
G/D-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2); GGAG
GAGAACAAACAGATCA & GTAGGACAGGAAGTTG
TTGG for cyclin D1; GTTGCCACTTCCACATAATG &
TCATCTGTGCTTTCATGTCA for HIF-1α; GTGGACA
TCTTCCAGGAGTA & GTGATGTTGGACTCCTCAGT
for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and
ggacctgactgactacctca & agcttctccttaatgtcacg for β-actin.

Immunohistochemistry
Xenograft tumor tissue specimens were
deparaffinized, autoclaved to retrieve antigens, and
sequentially incubated with 3% H2O2, a primary antibody
(anti-HIF-1α; anti-CD31, Thermo Fisher, Rockfordd,
IL); anti-Ki67, Leica Biosystems, Richmond, IL), and a
biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). The immune complexes were
visualized using Vectastatin ABC (Vector Laboratories),
and the specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Histology and immunostaining were reviewed under a
microscope at a ×400 magnification and all slides were
reviewed independently by four parts.

Anchorage-independent tumor growth assay

Statistical analyses

The top agar mixture (RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 0.4% agar, and 2 × 103 A549 cells) was
poured into a dish which had been coated with 0.8% agar,
and solidified. Cells were incubated for 3 weeks, and fresh
media containing compounds were administered twice a
week. Colonies were identified and calculated under an
inverted microscope at ×100 magnification.

Statistical analyses were performed using the
Microsoft Excel (2010) software and values were
described as means and standard deviation. The differences
between two groups were analyzed by two-sided, unpaired
Student t-test, and were considered statistically significant
when P < 0.05.

Endothelial tube formation assay
