Emerging Clinical Principles on the Use
of Bevacizumab for the Treatment of
Malignant Gliomas
Marc C. Chamberlain, MD

Despite advances in adjuvant therapy, the prognosis for most patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) is poor, and almost all
HGGs have a likelihood of disease recurrence. HGGs are highly vascularized tumors with elevated expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an important mediator of angiogenesis. A compelling biologic rationale, a pressing
need for improved therapeutics and positive results from studies of bevacizumab in other tumor types, led to the evaluation
of bevacizumab in the treatment of HGG. It was demonstrated previously that bevacizumab, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF, improved outcomes when combined with chemotherapy (most commonly irinotecan) in
patients with recurrent HGG; and, on the basis of an improved objective response rate in 2 prospective phase 2 studies, bevacizumab was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration as a single agent in patients with previously treated glioblastoma (GB). Bevacizumab-containing therapy has been associated with manageable, class-specific
toxicity; however, severe treatment-related adverse events are observed in a minority of patients. Preliminary data on bevacizumab-based therapy in recurrent anaplastic gliomas, in the frontline treatment of GB, and in additional patient populations
are also encouraging. With the goal of addressing unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of bevacizumab, the
objective of the current review was to provide a summary of the clinical efficacy and safety data on bevacizumab in patients
with HGG, the practical issues surrounding the administration of bevacizumab, and ongoing investigations of bevacizumab in

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive subtype of high-grade glioma (HGG) and is associated with a median

survival of less than 15 months.1 Patients with anaplastic gliomas (AG) have a modestly better prognosis, with an estimated median survival of between 3 years (for anaplastic astrocytoma [AA]) and 7 years (for anaplastic oligodendroglial
tumors).2,3 Responses to treatment are observed in <10% of patients with recurrent GB, and the median progression-free
survival (PFS) is estimated at 9 weeks and 13 weeks for patients with recurrent GB and AA, respectively.4 In 2005, a
randomized phase 3 trial demonstrated that the addition of temozolomide (TMZ) to adjuvant radiation therapy was
associated with an improvement in the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed GB from 12.1 months to
14.6 months.1 Although this treatment regimen is currently the standard of therapy for GB, there is still no clearly established standard of care for recurrent HGG.
Nearly all HGGs recur after initial therapy, and most patients do not survive beyond 1 year after the diagnosis of
recurrent disease.4 In historic phase 2 trials of a variety of chemotherapeutics in patients with previously treated GB,
response rates have not exceeded 6%, and 6-month PFS (PFS-6) rates have ranged between 9% and 28%.4-7 By contrast,
therapies for recurrent AG have been associated with response rates of approximately 35%, and PFS-6 rates have ranged
between 17% and 47%.4,5,7
Because reoperation and reradiation are treatment options for only a subset of patients, the majority of patients with
progressive HGG are offered chemotherapy (investigational or best available) at the time of recurrence. Data from clinical
trials have established antiangiogenic therapy with the humanized antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif), with or without cytotoxic

chemotherapy, as an active treatment option for patients
with recurrent GB who have failed previous TMZ therapy,8 leading to the recent US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of single-agent bevacizumab in
previously treated GB.9 Preliminary efficacy and safety
data describing bevacizumab-based therapy in recurrent
AG and additional neuro-oncology treatment settings,
although emerging, also are of interest. This review will
provide an overview of the role of angiogenesis in HGG
and the development of bevacizumab-based treatment,
the clinical efficacy and safety data on bevacizumab in this
tumor setting, practical insights into bevacizumab administration, and a forward outlook on bevacizumab in other
brain tumor treatment settings.
Angiogenesis and Malignant Gliomas
Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels
form from existing vasculature by endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Although angiogenesis is a natural
physiologic process, it is also required for tumor growth
beyond 0.125 mm because of to the limits of oxygen and
nutrient diffusion.10 Antiangiogenic strategies may be
effective in the treatment of cancer in part because of the
accessibility and genetic stability of endothelial cells, the
finding that angiogenesis largely is absent in healthy
adults, allowing for therapeutic selectivity, and the
residence of tumor stem cells in the (potentially targeted)
microvascular niche.11
Glioblastoma is 1 of the most vascularized cancers,12
and many preclinical studies use GB as a tumor model of
angiogenesis.13 VEGF is an important regulator of angiogenesis that is highly expressed within brain tumors14; in
GB, the highest levels of VEGF expression are observed in
areas of necrosis and regions of endothelial proliferation.15,16 The degree of both vasculature density and
VEGF expression is correlated with the malignancy and
aggressiveness of these tumors as well as with outcomes,
such as clinical recurrence and survival.17-20
The antiangiogenic agents that were evaluated first
in GB included the oral inhibitors thalidomide, lenalidomide (an analog of thalidomide), and carboxyamidotriazole as well as the copper-chelating drug penicillamine.
The results with these first-generation antiangiogenic
therapies, however, were disappointing—the demonstrated no additional clinical benefit compared with the
standard of care, weak inhibition of VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis, or a lack of survival benefit.21-25 Consequently, more recent investigations have focused on
newer, more potent antiangiogenic agents.

Bevacizumab for the Treatment of
Malignant Gliomas
Initially, the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy produced significant clinical benefit (PFS and/or
overall survival [OS]) in patients with previously
untreated and pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer,
advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer, and metastatic
breast cancer.26-29 Despite the exclusion of patients with
untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases from
the majority of early trials of bevacizumab, the combination of proven clinical activity in other solid tumors and
the pressing need for improved therapeutics in patients
with HGG resulted in considerable interest in evaluating
bevacizumab for the treatment of HGG. Notably, a recent
meta-analysis reported that patients with CNS metastases
who received bevacizumab have had low rates of tumorassociated CNS hemorrhage consistent with historic rates
in this patient population, providing subsequent evidence
of the safety of these investigations.30 Bevacizumab was
evaluated first in previously treated and recurrent HGG
in combination with irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, because of its activity with irinotecan-containing regimens in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.26 An
encouraging response rate (43%) was reported in an initial
retrospective study in HGG,31 prompting the investigation of bevacizumab with irinotecan in subsequent phase
2 studies.32-37 Several mechanisms of action have been
suggested for the antiglioma effect of antiangiogenic
agents, including direct inhibition of tumor-associated
neoangiogenesis, a direct antiglial effect on VEGF receptor-expressing tumor cells, disruption of the tumor stem
cell microvascular niche, and improved vascular function
or normalization (Fig. 1).13,39,42,44 The tumor stem cell
microvascular niche may represent an important target of
antiangiogenic agents, because the resident glioma stem
cells are a population of CD133-positive, nestin-positive,
self-renewing, multipotent tumor-initiating cells that are
relatively radioresistant and chemoresistant.38,39
Efficacy of Bevacizumab
Combination therapy for recurrent glioblastoma

To date, the available clinical data for bevacizumab
in GB are derived from phase 2 and retrospective
studies (Table 1). In the first completed, prospectively
designed, single-institution, phase 2 trial of bevacizumab
and irinotecan for recurrent GB, 20 of 35 patients (57%)
had at least a partial response (PR), and the PFS-6 rate
was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32%-66%).33

Figure 1. Proposed mechanisms of antiangiogenic agents in malignant gliomas are illustrated. Tumor stem cells represent a
potential target for antiangiogenic agents.38,39 It is hypothesized that vascular normalization mediates multiple effects: reduced
peritumoral edema, reduced contrast enhancement of the tumor, improved oxygen and drug delivery, and decreased tumor interstitial pressure.40-42 Antiangiogenic therapy also may sensitize endothelial cells to cytotoxic therapies.43

noncomparative phase 2 BRAIN study evaluating bevacizumab with or without irinotecan in previously treated
and recurrent GB subsequently reported a response rate of
38% (31 of 82 patients) with combination therapy and a
median response duration of 4.3 months.34 The combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan was associated with a
PFS-6 rate of 50% and a median OS of 8.7 months (95%
CI, 7.8-10.9 months).34 In retrospective analyses and
additional phase 2 studies, response rates with bevacizumab-based combination therapy have ranged between
38% and 62%, and PFS-6 rates have ranged between
30% and 46% in patients with recurrent GB, representing
a significant improvement compared with historic outcomes in this patient population.31,32,37,46,47 An improvement in median OS (ranging from 31 weeks to 42 weeks)
also has been observed with bevacizumab-based regimens
relative to historic controls.33,34,46,47 In a recent pilot
study, investigators demonstrated that the combination of
bevacizumab and concurrent radiotherapy was active and
well tolerated in patients with recurrent, malignant glioma.48 In patients with recurrent GB (n ¼ 20) who
received bevacizumab and hypofractionated stereotactic

radiotherapy, the overall response rate was 50%, the PFS6 rate was 65%, and the median OS was 12.5 months.
Monotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma

In addition to its activity when combined with
chemotherapeutics, it also has been demonstrated that
bevacizumab increases response and PFS when administered as a single agent in patients with recurrent GB
(Table 1).9,34,36 In the phase 2 BRAIN study of patients
with GB who developed recurrent disease after TMZ
treatment, the objective response rate with single-agent
bevacizumab was 28% (24 of 85 patients), and the
median response duration was 5.6 months.34 When
responses in that study were calculated on the basis of
radiographic criteria and stable or decreasing corticosteroid use, 25.9% of patients (95% CI, 17%-36.1%)
responded to bevacizumab monotherapy.9 The PFS-6
rate with single-agent bevacizumab was 42.6% (95% CI,
29.6%-55.5%), and the median OS was 9.2 months
(95% CI, 8.2-10.7 months).34 In the single-institution,

received single-agent bevacizumab, 71% and 35% of
patients achieved a radiographic response based on Levin
criteria and MacDonald criteria, respectively.36 When
using radiographic criteria and stable or decreasing corticosteroid use as a measure of response, the objective
response rate was 19.6% (11 of 56 patients; 95% CI,
10.9%-31.3%),9 the median PFS was 16 weeks (95% CI,
12-26 weeks), the PFS-6 rate was 29% (95% CI, 18%48%), and the median OS was 31 weeks (95% CI, 21-54
weeks).36 The improved objective response rates observed
in the BRAIN and NCI 06-C-0064E studies resulted in
the accelerated approval of single-agent bevacizumab for
patients with progressive GB after previous, upfront,
TMZ-based therapy. Two additional studies (a phase 2
trial and a retrospective analysis) have evaluated singleagent bevacizumab in recurrent GB—response rates in
those trials were 25% and 42%, respectively, and the PFS6 rates were 32% and 42%, respectively.49,50
Therapy for recurrent anaplastic gliomas

Bevacizumab treatment in patients with recurrent
AG also has achieved favorable outcomes compared with
historic controls, with response rates ranging between
34% and 68% and PFS-6 rates ranging between 32% and
68% for patients who received bevacizumab and chemotherapy.35,46,51,52 Despite the improvements in response
rates reported in those studies, no apparent survival benefit was observed: The median OS ranged between 36
weeks and 65 weeks in patients with recurrent AG who
received bevacizumab treatment.35,46,51,52
Safety Profile of Bevacizumab
Overall, bevacizumab treatment is generally well tolerated
in patients with recurrent GB, and the bevacizumabrelated toxicities are similar to those that have been characterized in other solid tumor types. Reported rates of
grade 3 or greater adverse events with bevacizumab in
patients with recurrent GB have ranged between 18% and
66%, and it appears that the rate of serious treatmentrelated adverse events is lower when bevacizumab is used
as a single agent.34,36,37,49 In the randomized, noncomparative phase 2 BRAIN study in patients with progressive
GB, the rate of grade 3 or greater adverse events was 46%
in patients who received bevacizumab monotherapy and
66% in patients who received combined bevacizumab
plus irinotecan.34 Cross-trial comparisons also have suggested that single-agent bevacizumab is associated with a
lower rate of grade 3 adverse events than bevacizumabcontaining combinations for GB; however, those observa-

3992

tions were subject to differences in study design and
patient populations.37,49
The most common adverse events with bevacizumab
treatment in recurrent GB include low-grade bleeding,
hypertension, impaired wound healing, and proteinuria,32-34 which also were associated with bevacizumab in
other cancer types.26,28,29 The majority of these toxicities
appear to be caused by on-target, class-specific actions of
antiangiogenic agents and reflect the disruption of VEGF
in normal tissue. The rates of serious adverse events, such
as gastrointestinal perforation, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and wound-healing complications studies are low in GB studies(each 4%
incidence) (Fig. 2).31-34,46,48,50,53 Although the reported
rate of grade 2 or greater bleeding events has been as high
as 5.3%, life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages have
occurred in only a small percentage of patients (3%)
treated with bevacizumab.31-34,37,46,50 This latter incidence rate falls within the expected range for spontaneous
events in patients with HGG (approximately 2%3%).54,55 Relatively high rates of thromboembolism have
been reported in studies that evaluated bevacizumab-containing therapy in recurrent GB (ranging from 1.6% to
12.5%) (Fig. 2); however, these rates must be considered
in the context of the significant risk of thromboembolic
events that is inherent in patients with HGG.56 Thus, the
cumulative data from clinical trials suggest that, despite
small risks of life-threatening complications, including intracranial hemorrhages and thromboembolic events, bevacizumab-containing therapy is well tolerated with
manageable, class-specific toxicities.
Practical Issues Surrounding Bevacizumab
Administration
There are several practical issues related to treatment
administration, combination therapy, contraindications
and other safety-related issues, response evaluation, and
disease course that are relevant to the use of bevacizumab for HGG (Table 2). With regard to administration, the recommended dose and schedule of singleagent bevacizumab is 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2
weeks in patients with recurrent GB.9 Although most
studies in recurrent HGG have evaluated bevacizumab
(in combination with irinotecan) on a schedule of
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or a weekly equivalent dose
of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the ideal treatment schedule or dosage of bevacizumab is unclear, because no
direct comparisons of different treatment schedules
or dose-response studies have been conducted.57,58

patients46 and 11 of 61 patients50); dagger, clinical trials that reported only grade 3 adverse events.

Consequently, until a benefit in efficacy and/or tolerability has been established with an alternative dosing
regimen, bevacizumab should be administered as a single agent according to the prescribing information at a
dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.
It is also unclear which therapeutic agent, if any,
should be combined with bevacizumab to improve efficacy in recurrent HGG. The similar response and PFS-6
rates observed with bevacizumab monotherapy relative to
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (predominantly irinotecan), combined with the limited single-agent activity of
irinotecan in recurrent GB, have led investigators and the
FDA to argue that it is unclear whether irinotecan

contributes additional clinical benefit to bevacizumabbased regimens in recurrent HGG.36,59-63 For these reasons, along with the observation that higher rates of grade
3 or greater adverse events are associated with the combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab, the addition of
irinotecan does not appear to be justified at this time. The
identification of an alternative partner for bevacizumab
currently is an active area of research; for example, phase 2
studies are evaluating bevacizumab with erlotinib (an
epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor), and fotemustine (a second-generation nitrosourea) in recurrent
HGG.20,64,65

Table 2. Clinical Pearls: Practical Issues Regarding Bevacizumab Treatment in Patients With High-Grade Glioma

Administration and concomitant treatment
 The recommended dose and schedule of single-agent bevacizumab in patients with recurrent GB is 10 mg/kg intravenously every
2 wk until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
 Dose reductions of bevacizumab are not required in patients who are receiving enzyme-inducing, antiepileptic drugs.
 There appears to be no increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage with the concurrent use of bevacizumab and anticoagulants.

Safety considerations
 Treatment with bevacizumab should be discontinued for specific severe adverse events, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and bowel perforation. Other important adverse events that warrant discontinuation of bevacizumab include
medically refractory hypertension, proteinuria (NCI CTC grade >2), and arterial/venous thrombosis.
 Bevacizumab-based therapy should be suspended within 4 to 6 wk of surgery.
 Blood pressure should be assessed before each bevacizumab administration and proteinuria should be monitored by urine protein/
creatinine ratio every cycle or every other cycle.

Response to therapy and disease course
 It is not yet established which brain tumor radiographic response criteria (ie, Levin, MacDonald, or RANO) are best for evaluating antiangiogenic therapies.
 Bevacizumab therapy is associated with a clinically meaningful corticosteroid sparing effect in >33% of patients with HGG.
 The results of a recent retrospective analysis support the inclusion of older patients (aged ‡55 y) in studies of bevacizumab in HGG.
 Antiangiogenic therapy appears to be cytostatic and likely requires long-term, continuous treatment.
 An increased FLAIR MRI signal appears to be the best indicator of progressive disease, although this is best appreciated retrospectively and by serial imaging.
 The appropriate options are unclear for patients with HGG who develop disease progression after antiangiogenic treatment; the current data do not support the use of bevacizumab with irinotecan for patients with progressive disease after single-agent bevacizumab
nor bevacizumab with carboplatin after treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan.

Clinical experience suggests that bevacizumab is not
contraindicated in patients who are receiving other
concomitant medications, such as enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) or anticoagulants. Dose modifications of bevacizumab generally are not required, even
when administered to patients who are receiving EIAEDs
like phenytoin or carbamazepine.32,33 In addition, there
does not appear to be an increased risk of hemorrhage (intracranial or extracranial) with or without the concurrent
use of bevacizumab with anticoagulants46,66; in a retrospective review of thromboembolic events in 21 patients
with HGG, the investigators concluded that the use of
anticoagulants did not lead to any major hemorrhages and
did not appear to prohibit the initiation or continuation
of bevacizumab therapy.66
However, there are specific severe adverse events
that occur at a relatively low incidence but that require
dose delays or cessation of bevacizumab. Compelling indications for discontinuing bevacizumab therapy include intracranial hemorrhage (Common Toxicity Criteria grade
2 or greater), bowel perforation, and wound dehiscence53;
and temporary suspension of bevacizumab is recommended 4 weeks before surgery and for patients who have
evidence of moderate-to-severe proteinuria or severe
hypertension that is not controllable with medication.9 It

3994

has been demonstrated that the blockade of VEGF
impairs wound healing, and several studies have indicated
a small risk of wound dehiscence, either at the site of the
craniotomy or at the central venous line.31-34,45,46,67 In
practice, this observation mandates that antiangiogenic
therapy not commence until the craniotomy (or surgical
wound) is healed, which may require 4 to 6 weeks. It is
noteworthy that there are differences in the frequency of
monitoring for select bevacizumab-related side effects,
such as proteinuria, between clinical trials and current
clinical practice; based on clinical trial protocols, testing
the urine protein/creatinine ratio is recommended either
with every cycle or with every other cycle of bevacizumab.
Clinical experience has delineated the challenges of
determining patient response and disease course after
treatment with antiangiogenic agents in HGG. Currently,
there are no clear guidelines for evaluating neuroradiographic response or progression because of limitations of
standard MacDonald response criteria, and it remains
unclear what constitutes the best response criteria for antiangiogenic therapies.36,68 Proposed methods for measuring antiangiogenesis include assaying for angiogenic
factors (eg, serum or urinary VEGF, basic fibroblast
growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase, or urokinase
plasminogen activator) or for ex vivo markers (eg,

circulating endothelial cells); biopsy analysis (to determine tumor density and drug-target interactions); and
radiographic assessment (calculating fluoro-L-thymidinepositron emission tomographic response, changes in the
apparent diffusion coefficient, or the ratio of fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery [FLAIR] volume to contrastenhancing tumor volume).67,69-73 In addition, there is no
current consensus regarding the most effective method for
a priori determination of response to bevacizumab treatment. Common practice in patients with recurrent HGG
who receive bevacizumab involves magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) evaluations after 2 cycles of treatment
and, if the patient is stable or responding, then MRI evaluations after every subsequent 4 cycles of bevacizumab.
A secondary benefit of bevacizumab in patients with
HGG is its demonstrated ability to decrease both tumoral
and peritumoral edema in patients with HGG, thereby
reducing the requirement for chronic corticosteroid use.
Several studies have reported that corticosteroid reductions were feasible in 33% to 59% of patients with recurrent GB after bevacizumab treatment,32,34,36,46,49,74 and
2 trials have reported average corticosteroid dose reductions of 72% and 59%,36,74 respectively. The ability of
bevacizumab-based therapy to reduce corticosteroid usage
is an important benefit, because chronic corticosteroid use
in patients with HGG is associated with significant morbidity and numerous side effects, including a Cushingoid
pattern of weight gain, hyperglycemia, skin fragility, and
bleeding; myopathy; lymphopenia; infection; and thromboembolism.75-77
It is noteworthy that a recent retrospective analysis
in recurrent GB comparing outcomes between patients
who received bevacizumab treatment (n ¼ 44) and
patients in a control group (n ¼ 79) suggested that the
effect of bevacizumab is greater in older patients.47 In the
older cohort (patients aged 55 years), bevacizumab
treatment was associated with a significant improvement
in both PFS (P ¼ .02) and OS (P ¼ .03) relative to the
control group. By contrast, no treatment-related differences in outcomes were observed in younger patients (aged
<55 years). The authors hypothesized that this age-dependent response may be reflective of biologic differences
(eg, VEGF expression levels) in GB between various age
groups.47 At a minimum, these results support the applicability of bevacizumab for older patients with GB.
Despite clear evidence of bevacizumab activity in
recurrent HGG, not all patients respond to treatment,
and no biomarkers for patients who are responsive to
antiangiogenic therapies have been identified. One expla-

nation for the lack of response after bevacizumab treatment is that antiangiogenic therapy treats only 1 of several
tumor compartments—the angiogenic-dependent, contrast-enhancing component—and does not target the
highly infiltrative, migratory, angiogenic-independent
compartment (eg, the leading edge of infiltrating glioma
cells [FLAIR-defined tumor volume]).53,68 In a retrospective analysis, a diffuse, infiltrative pattern of recurrence
was observed in 8 or 40 patients (20%; 95% CI, 9%36%) who received salvage bevacizumab treatment for
recurrent GB.78 Although those authors noted that this
pattern of recurrence appeared to be more prevalent with
bevacizumab treatment, the analysis, because it lacked a
control arm, did not provide a corresponding baseline
value to establish a more definitive association for this recurrence pattern. It is known that abrupt cessation of antiVEGF therapy may result in rebound edema and clinical
deterioration (the so-called flare response), activation of
non-VEGF proangiogenic stimuli, and the emergence of
highly proliferative tumor clones, suggesting that antiangiogenic therapy is cytostatic rather than cytocidal.79
Consequently, in stable or responding patients who
receive bevacizumab, long-term, continuous treatment is
required.80 FLAIR MRI, in conjunction with clinical
symptoms, appears to be the best indicator of progressive
disease, and an increased FLAIR signal often precedes the
re-emergence of contrast-enhancing tumor.45,46,51,52
Determining appropriate treatment options for
patients with HGG who progress after bevacizumab treatment is of significant clinical interest and is another area
of active investigation. In 2 retrospective studies, it was
observed that patients who progressed (after an initial
response) on frontline treatment with a bevacizumab-containing regimen rarely responded to bevacizumab combined with alternative chemotherapy upon disease
progression: The reported PFS-6 rate was 2%, and longterm disease control was achieved in 9.5% of patients,
respectively.46,81 Additional studies have reported that
patients who received bevacizumab plus irinotecan or an
alternative cytotoxic therapy after progression on singleagent bevacizumab had poor outcomes: Zero of 19
patients had radiographic responses in a prospective phase
2 study, and a median OS of 2 months (range, 1-5
months) was reported in a retrospective analysis.36,49 In a
recent study of 35 patients with GB who progressed after
treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan, continuous
low-dose TMZ was added to bevacizumab and irinotecan.
The authors concluded that this regimen appears to have
activity in patients with previously treated GB (partial

3995

responses in 11.4%, stable disease for 2 months in 40%,
and a median survival of 5 months [range, 2-13
months]).82 Further investigation is necessary, however,
to confirm these preliminary results. Patients with GB
who progress after an initial response to bevacizumab represent a challenging patient population. These patients
are offered and increasingly will be offered novel investigational treatments, such as vascular-disrupting agents,
therapies that target cell migration, and alternative antiangiogenic therapies (ie, therapeutics that target basic fibroblast growth factor; stromal cell-derived factor-1a; the
TEK tyrosine kinase receptor, endothelial Tie2; hepatocyte growth factor; and the c-Met receptor83).
Forward Outlook
Because of the positive clinical results observed in recurrent GB, bevacizumab continues to be evaluated in additional treatment settings. Data from clinical trials of
bevacizumab in the treatment of recurrent AG are emerging, as discussed above, and suggest that bevacizumab
may improve response and PFS-6 rates compared with
historic controls.35,46,51,52
There also are several ongoing and planned studies
evaluating bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed
GB, and several studies recently reported preliminary data
on the use of bevacizumab with chemoradiation in this
treatment setting.84-89 The initial results suggest that the
addition of bevacizumab to the upfront management of
GB is associated with acceptable toxicity and promising
activity. Early efficacy results in 2 studies evaluating bevacizumab with radiotherapy and TMZ for the treatment of
newly diagnosed GB compare favorably with data from a
historic European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Institute of Canada
Clinical Trials Group trial.1,86,87 One of those studies
reported that the addition of bevacizumab resulted in an
improved median PFS of 13 months (95% CI, 11.3-15.9
months) compared with 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.9-8.2
months) in the historic study.87 It is noteworthy that
2 large phase 3 trials—Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) trial RTOG-0825 (a US-based study
sponsored by the RTOG) and AVAglio (a global study
sponsored by Roche Pharmaceuticals of bevacizumab
combined with standard-of-care therapy after surgery in
patients with GB multiforme)—have opened this year
and will prospectively evaluate bevacizumab-containing
regimens in patients with newly diagnosed GB. The
results from those studies are needed to establish the safety
(including the potential for wound-healing complica-

3996

tions) and efficacy of combining bevacizumab with radiotherapy and TMZ in the frontline setting for newly
diagnosed GB.
Because a secondary benefit of bevacizumab therapy
is a marked improvement of peritumoral edema, leading
to reductions in or discontinuance of chronic corticosteroid use, bevacizumab also may be useful in the management of symptomatic patients who have suspected
pseudoprogression after concurrent TMZ and radiation
for newly diagnosed GB90 and in patients who have inoperable, newly diagnosed GB complicated by large, corticosteroid-dependent tumor masses. In addition, there are
indications that bevacizumab may be beneficial in patients
with other brain tumors and CNS disorders, such as
radiation-induced necrosis with mass effect,74,91,92 and
highly angiogenic, nonglioma, recurrent primary brain
tumors like meningioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma,93 oligodendroglial tumors,52,94,95 neurofibromatosis 2-related vestibular schwannomas,96 and
radiation-induced myelopathy.97

DISCUSSION
Antiangiogenic agents hold great promise for the treatment of HGG—a malignant disease associated with poor
patient prognosis. Bevacizumab is the best characterized
antiangiogenic therapy and recently received FDA approval as a single agent for the treatment of patients with
progressive GB after previous upfront, TMZ-based therapy. In addition to its use as monotherapy for recurrent
GB, preliminary data with bevacizumab in recurrent AG
and in additional treatment settings appear promising,
and these are areas of active clinical investigation. Overall,
treatment with bevacizumab in multiple GB studies
appears to be well tolerated with toxicity (ie, bleeding,
hypertension, wound dehiscence, proteinuria, intracranial
hemorrhage, and thromboembolism) similar to that
observed in other solid cancers treated with bevacizumabcontaining therapies.
Because of the extensive clinical experience with bevacizumab, practical issues regarding its administration,
safety profile, and response to treatment have been
described. Notwithstanding this knowledge, several important questions about the use of bevacizumab in HGG
remain unanswered—for example, the optimal therapeutic partner, dosage, treatment schedule, and radiographic
response criteria of bevacizumab all are unknown, as are
the treatment options that should be offered to patients
who progress on bevacizumab-based therapy. Many of

these unanswered questions are being addressed in ongoing clinical trials, and the results from those trials likely
will to continue to drive improvements in the treatment
of patients with HGG.
