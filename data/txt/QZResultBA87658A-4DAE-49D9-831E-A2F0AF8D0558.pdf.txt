BACKGROUND: Isolated limb infusion with melphalan is a well-tolerated treatment for patients with
in-transit extremity melanoma with an approximately 30% complete response (CR) rate. ADH-1 is a cyclic
pentapeptide that disrupts N-cadherin adhesion complexes and when given systemically in a preclinical
model of regional melphalan therapy demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity. A phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of systemic ADH-1 in
combination with melphalan via isolated limb infusion in patients with in-transit extremity melanoma was
performed. METHODS: Dose escalation cohorts of 3 patients each received 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg (10
patients) of ADH-1 administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 with standard dose melphalan via isolated
limb infusion on Day 1. N-cadherin immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis were performed on pretreatment tumor. Response was defined at 3 months using modified
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS: Sixteen patients have been treated with no
observed dose-limiting toxicities. Common treatment-related grade 1 or 2 toxicities included skin/dermatologic (n ¼ 14) and pain (n ¼ 12). Grade 3 toxicities included shortness of breath (n ¼ 1), hypertension (n ¼
1), serologic toxicities (n ¼ 4), and 1 grade 4 creatine phosphokinase elevation. In-field responses included
8 CRs, 2 partial responses, 1 stable disease, and 5 progressive diseases. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated increasing ADH-1 concentrations at each dose and minimal variability in melphalan drug levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic ADH-1 at a dose of 4000 mg on Days 1 and 8 in combination with melphalan via
isolated limb infusion is a well-tolerated, novel targeted therapy approach to regionally advanced melanoma. The number of CRs exceeded expectations, suggesting that targeting N-cadherin may be a new

KEY WORDS: ADH-1, limb infusion, melanoma, regional chemotherapy.

In 2% to 10% of extremity melanoma cases, lesions recur
in a locoregional fashion, confined to the extremity and
located between the site of the primary lesion and regional
lymph nodes1,2 in a pattern called in-transit disease. The
presence of in-transit metastases is associated with a
poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates ranging from
12% to 37%.3-5 Systemic chemotherapy with the
best-studied single-agent chemotherapies is associated
with low, short-lived response rates.6,7 Treatment of
in-transit disease is unique in that isolation of the limb
using the techniques of hyperthermic isolated limb
perfusion (HILP) with melphalan (L-phenylalanine
mustard [LPAM])8-12 and more recently isolated limb
infusion13-15 with melphalan  dactinomycin can enable
delivery of regional chemotherapy several orders of
magnitude higher than can be attained with systemic
administration. We recently reported a complete response
(CR) at 3 months of 30% in patients (n ¼ 50) undergoing
isolated limb infusion with melphalan and dactinomycin
and found that patients experienced significantly less
major morbidity than with HILP (P ¼ .037).16 New
strategies to improve response rates for melanoma have
focused on targeted agents that can improve sensitivity to
chemotherapy by modulating known resistance proteins
or targeting signaling proteins in survival/apoptotic
pathways.17,18
ADH-1 is a novel, pentapeptide drug that targets
and disrupts N-cadherin adhesion complexes. ADH-1 has
been shown in phase I and II single-agent studies to be
well tolerated and to show evidence of antitumor
activity restricted to patients with N-cadherin–positive
tumors.19-21 N-cadherin is theoretically an ideal protein
to target in melanoma, because it is expressed on the
majority of melanoma lesions as they progress from a predominantly E-cadherin phenotype as melanocytes to a
predominantly N-cadherin phenotype during their vertical growth phase.22,23 This switch from E- to N-cadherin
expression is also associated with changes in intracellular
signaling pathways leading to increased proliferation,

increased survival, and decreased apoptosis24 that if
antagonized may improve tumor responses.
We hypothesized that ADH-1–induced disruption
of N-cadherin adhesion complexes could induce downstream alterations in intracellular signaling pathways
that would sensitize tumor cells to melphalan. In preclinical studies using a rat xenograft model of extremity
melanoma, tumors treated with systemic ADH-1 in
combination with melphalan via isolated limb infusion
demonstrated decreased growth and increased apoptosis
when compared with tumors treated with melphalan via
isolated limb infusion alone.25 Here, we report results
from a multicenter phase 1 dose escalation study to
evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
antitumor activity of systemic ADH-1 in combination
with melphalan via isolated limb infusion in patients
with locally advanced in-transit melanoma of the
extremity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients were eligible for this study if they were 18 years
of age and had histologically confirmed recurrent American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIB or
IIIC extremity melanoma,26 tissue available for N-cadherin staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC), directly
measurable cutaneous disease distal to planned tourniquet
placement, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1. The following laboratory
parameters were required before treatment: aspartate
aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 2.5
times the upper limit of normal (ULN), serum bilirubin
times ULN, absolute granulocyte count 1.5  109/L,
platelet count 100  109/L, hemoglobin 10 g/dL,
serum creatinine 1.5  ULN, and a negative serum or
urine pregnancy test before study entry for women of
childbearing potential. Patients were excluded if they had
received ADH-1 before this study, although previous

melphalan via isolated limb infusion was allowed. All
patients were required to give informed consent, and the
institutional review boards of the participating institutions approved the study.
Study Design
This trial was an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 dose
escalation study. Treatment consisted of intravenous
ADH-1 administered on Days 1 and 8 in addition to isolated limb infusion with melphalan on Day 1. ADH-1
doses of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 4000 mg were evaluated
in successive cohorts in combination with melphalan
administered regionally via isolated limb infusion at a
dose of 10 mg/L for the upper extremity and 7.5 mg/L for
the lower extremity (Fig. 1). The 4000-mg dose of ADH1 was previously demonstrated to be safe in patients and
was the highest dose for which there was already extensive
safety data.27 The dose of melphalan was calculated
according to limb volume and corrected for ideal body
weight as previously described.16 Isolated limb infusion
was performed as described previously,16 using a rapid
infusion of melphalan (2-5 minutes) in the arterial catheter after the extremity had been warmed to at least
37.0 C. Melphalan was administered a minimum of 4
hours after ADH-1 dose on Day 1.
A minimum of 3 subjects and a maximum of 6 subjects were enrolled in each cohort, depending on the
observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) using a standard
phase 1 dose escalation design. A total of 10 subjects were
enrolled in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort
(including 3-6 subjects enrolled in the dose escalation
phase). The MTD was determined by the highest dose at
which <2 of 6 patients experienced a DLT. For cohorts
1-3, the ADH-1 dose escalated to the next dose level or
expanded at the same dose level once the last subject in
each cohort had been evaluated on Day 15 and a safety
call had occurred between Adherex Technologies, Inc.
(Durham, NC) and the site investigators to confirm the
safety data. All subjects were followed for 12 weeks from
the first dose of ADH-1 administration to collect safety
and tolerability data.
Assessment of Tumor Response
Tumor response was evaluated according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors modified for cutane4768

ous lesions at 1 time point 3 months after isolated limb
infusion. Lesions were designated as target lesions and
nontarget lesions.16 In-field response was documented at
3 months from isolated limb infusion as described,16 and
patients were classified as having a CR, partial response
(PR), stable disease (SD), or progression of disease (PD).

Toxicity Evaluation
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. DLTs were drug-related toxicities defined as the
following: absolute granulocyte count <0.5  109/L lasting 7 days, grade 3 neutropenic infection or febrile
neutropenia, platelets <50  109/L lasting 7 days,
symptomatic bleeding sufficient to require therapeutic
intervention, nonhematological toxicity of grade 3 severity (except pain induced by study drug administration
in the region of known tumor despite appropriate medical
intervention or grade 3 fatigue), and grade 4 drugrelated regional toxicities as defined by specified areas pertinent to limb toxicity (or inability to receive 2 weekly
doses of ADH-1 in combination with regionally administered melphalan).

Pharmacokinetic Evaluations
During the 30-minute circulation of melphalan through
the infusion circuit, blood samples (5 mL) from the venous stopcock of the circuit were obtained at 0 (preisolated limb infusion), 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes to
assess melphalan levels. The melphalan concentration in
plasma was measured in each sample as published previously16 by an assay based on a published high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-fluorescence
method by Ehrsson et al.28

* Patient had single-target lesion, no biopsy allowed per protocol, and fine-needle aspiration insufficient for determination.

ADH-1 Pharmacokinetic Method
Just before the administration of melphalan during
isolated limb infusion, a blood sample (5 mL) was
obtained from the venous side of the circuit to assess
ADH-1 concentration. ADH-1 in human plasma was
detected using a validated HPLC method with single mass
detection using MultiPROBE II automated extraction.
The detection range was between 50 and 25,000 ng/mL.

IHC
N-cadherin IHC staining and scoring were conducted
by Biotechnics (Hillsborough, NC). IHC slides produced to determine the presence of N-cadherin were
processed from patient tumor samples embedded in paraffin wax blocks. After appropriate processing, sections
were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibody
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif, cat# 18-0224, 1:200 dilution) or mouse isotype negative control (Invitrogen cat#
08-6599) followed by incubation with secondary antibody (biotinylated goat antimouse, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa, cat# 115-066-071, 1:500

dilution) for 30 minutes at room temperature. ABC reagent (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif) was applied to sections and incubated for
30 minutes at 37 C. Sections were developed in diaminobenzidine for 7 minutes at room temperature and
counterstained with hematoxylin.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
Tumor biopsies from nontarget in-transit lesions were
obtained before ADH-1 or isolated limb infusion with
melphalan treatment and stored at 130 C until ready
for use. The use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(QPCR) was exploratory and not included as part of the
initial trial protocol. Biopsies were homogenized using
Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, Calif) and a
mini bead-beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Okla).
RNA was isolated, cDNA synthesized, and QPCR
performed as described previously.29 See Table 1 legend
for primer sequences. N-cadherin expression values were
normalized to b-actin and expressed as fold difference
from a human reference RNA sample (Stratagene, San
Diego, Calif).

RESULTS
A total of 16 patients were treated according to Figure 1.
Hypoxia and acidosis during isolated limb infusion were
achieved with the following median values: pH at 30
minutes 7.11 (range, 6.99-7.23), base excess at 30 minutes
8.7 mmol/L (range, 14.1 to 3 mmol/L), pO2 at 30
minutes 6 mm Hg (range, 1-8 mm Hg), and median peak
temperature 38.6 C (range, 37.8̊C to 39.3̊C). The median
ischemic time was 65.5 minutes (range, 59-86 minutes),
and the median volume recirculated over the 30-minute
infusion was 1470 mL (range, 700 mL-1960 mL).
Safety Profile
There were no ADH-1 DLTs reported in any cohort. No
clinical toxicities of severity higher than grade 3 by the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
for Adverse Events version 3.0 were reported in any
cohort. There was a grade 4 serologic toxicity in the form
of an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in 1 patient
in cohort 3. The patient was treated with dexamethasone;
the CPK trended down and was normal at the 2-week follow-up visit. The grade 3 toxicities reported include elevated CPK (n ¼ 2), anemia (n ¼ 1), neutropenia (n ¼ 1),
shortness of breath (n ¼ 1), and hypertension (n ¼ 1).
These toxicities resolved with appropriate treatment and
were not likely to be related to ADH-1. The most
common toxicities from all cohorts are listed in Table 2.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The median time between the first dose of ADH-1 and
isolated limb infusion was 8.1 hours (range, 4.4-11.5
hours) (n ¼ 16). The half-life of ADH-1 in humans has
been previously determined to be between 1.4 and 2.2
hours.30 Figure 2 (Top) depicts the ADH-1 plasma
concentrations for each patient just before isolated limb
infusion. These pharmacokinetic characteristics were
similar to those reported in patients receiving ADH-1 as a
single agent.20
The median dose of melphalan for the upper
extremity was 19.6 mg (range, 18.3-20.9 mg), whereas
the median dose for the lower extremity was 46.6 mg
(range, 33.6-70.3 mg). ADH-1 did not appear to alter
LPAM pharmacokinetics, as shown in Figure 2 (Bottom).

DISCUSSION
The novel combination of systemic ADH-1 with melphalan via isolated limb infusion is the first to target N-cadherin as a method to augment the cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapies. The rationale for this trial was built on a
preclinical model that demonstrated dramatically augmented antitumor effects to chemotherapy using an Ncadherin antagonist.25 Isolated limb infusion and HILP
with melphalan are widely accepted therapeutic
approaches for patients with in-transit melanoma of the
extremity.16 The combination of systemic ADH-1 and
melphalan via isolated limb infusion was safe and well tolerated, with no DLTs seen in this group of 16 treated
patients. Most of the toxicities experienced in these
patients were known toxicities of melphalan via isolated
limb infusion, as previously reported.16 None of these
adverse events was considered medically significant, and
all resolved without sequelae. As such, there appears to be
no increase in toxicity for patients treated with the combination therapy in this study compared with patients
treated with melphalan via isolated limb infusion alone.
Plasma concentrations of ADH-1 just before
isolated limb infusion were similar among individuals in
the same cohort, whereas the time between ADH-1 and
melphalan administration was somewhat different
between patients (median, 8.1 hours; range, 4.4-11.5
hours). Given the half-life of ADH-1 and based on the
preclinical model, the goal of this study was to administer
melphalan approximately 3 to 4 half-lives (6-8 hours)
after the initial dose of ADH-1 to optimize potential
therapeutic effects. Although the small set of patients in
this study precludes any conclusions about the optimal
time between ADH-1 and melphalan delivery, certainly
this will be a factor to explore as the 4000-mg ADH-1
cohort is expanded in a phase 2 study.
Our hypothesis is that ADH-1 may sensitize melanoma cells to the cytotoxic effects of melphalan in part
through ADH-1’s activity as an N-cadherin antagonist. In
this study’s treated population of 16 patients, 9 (56%)
had tissue that was positive by IHC for N-cadherin. In
these 9 patients, there were 5 CRs, 2 PRs, and 2 PDs. The
finding that 3 patients with N-cadherin–negative tissue
4772

obtained a CR is not surprising, given that we have previously demonstrated that N-cadherin expression is not correlated with drug resistance, and approximately 30% of
patients respond completely to melphalan via isolated
limb infusion alone. Whether ADH-1 helps tumors
already sensitive to melphalan respond more completely
or whether it sensitizes tumors that would not otherwise
be sensitive to LPAM remains to be determined. In our
preclinical studies, however, ADH-1 treatment increased
LPAM-induced DNA adduct formation.25
In the first 6 patients, we explored the use of fine
needle aspiration to make N-cadherin determination via
IHC. We learned that these samples were not ideal for
making this determination. As such, per trial protocol,
subsequent patients had a punch biopsy of 1 in-transit
lesion performed to obtain adequate tissue for N-cadherin
determination. We have previously demonstrated using
gene expression profiles that a single lesion is representative of all lesions in a patient with multiple nodules.31
Some patients (n ¼ 7 of 16) only had 1 target lesion.
These individuals had archived specimens assessed for Ncadherin determination. IHC may be a less sensitive
method for detecting N-cadherin expression,25 and thus
we explored the use of QPCR for detecting N-cadherin
expression in clinical samples. N-cadherin expression was
detected by QPCR in the 7 patients who had in-transit
lesions amenable to punch biopsy. In 3 of these patients,
N-cadherin expression was detected by QPCR, although
not by IHC. As we expand cohort 3 in the phase 2 portion
of this study, obtaining valid N-cadherin status on tissue
will be important to determine whether any difference
in efficacy of the treatment exists between N-cadherin–
negative and N-cadherin–positive patients as well as to
define what level of N-cadherin expression may be necessary to see ADH-1–induced augmentation of LPAM
activity.
The CR rate in patients (n ¼ 60) from the Sydney
Melanoma Unit study with M. D. Anderson stage IIIab31
(corresponding to AJCC stage IIIC) was 33%, whereas
the CR rate in patients (n ¼ 74) with M. D. Anderson
stage IIIa (corresponding to AJCC stage IIIB) was 43%.
CR to melphalan via isolated limb infusion was shown by
the Southern Methodist University study to be durable,
with a limb recurrence-free interval of 22 months (interquartile range to 120 months) (unpublished data). In
addition, for those patients who achieved a CR, survival
Cancer

was significantly longer (median, 53 months) than the
survival in the group of patients in whom no CR occurred
(median, 25 months) (P ¼ .005) (unpublished data).
Although regional therapy has not been proven to impact
survival, results from Southern Methodist University suggest that achieving a CR may provide effective palliation.
In the Duke study of isolated limb infusion with melphalan þ dactinomycin (n ¼ 50), overall response was 44%,
with 30% being CRs and 14% being PRs. In this study,
tumor responses, especially the CRs seen in this small subset of patients, were encouraging in comparison to
reported response rates of melphalan via isolated limb
infusion. The patient populations, technical details of isolated limb infusion, and other variables in the Duke study
were similar to this study.16
Results from this study demonstrate that systemic
ADH-1 on Days 1 and 8 in combination with melphalan
via isolated limb infusion on Day 1 is a safe, well-tolerated, and novel targeted therapy approach for patients
with in-transit extremity melanoma. The 50% CR rate
achieved in the small number of patients in this study
with no observed increases in toxicity warrants further
investigation of this combination therapy. On the basis of
this trial, the 4000-mg dose of ADH-1 on Days 1 and 8 in
combination with melphalan dosed according to limb volume and corrected for ideal body weight on Day 1 will be
the doses used in the phase 2 portion of this trial.
