ABSTRACT
Cisplatin (cis-Pt) resistance in tumor cells from p53 dysfunction is a significant
clinical problem. Although mutation can inhibit p53 function, >60% of p53 mutants
retain normal function according to literature reports. Therefore, we examined the
status of p53 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor models and its functional response
to cis-Pt and the mechanistically-distinct non-cross-resistant oxaliplatin (oxaliPt). Relative to sensitive A2780 cells harboring wild-type p53, the 2780CP/Cl-16,
OVCAR-10, Hey and OVCA-433 cell lines were 10- to 30-fold resistant to cis-Pt, but
was substantially circumvented by oxali-Pt. Mutant p53 in 2780CP/Cl-16 (p53V172F)
and OVCAR-10 (p53V172F and p53G266R) cells, predicted as non-functional in p53
database, displayed attenuated response to cis-Pt, as did the polymorphic p53P72R
(functionally equivalent to wild-type p53) in HEY and OVCA-433 cell lines. However,
p53 was robustly activated by oxali-Pt in all cell lines, with resultant drug potency
confirmed as p53-dependent by p53 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 system. This p53
activation by oxali-Pt was associated with phosphorylation at Ser20 by MEK1/2 based
on inhibitor and kinase studies. Cis-Pt, however, failed to phosphorylate Ser20 due to
downregulated Chk2, and its clinical impact validated by reduced overall survival of
ovarian cancer patients according to TCGA database. In conclusion, cis-Pt resistance
occurs in both wild-type and mutant p53 ovarian cancer cells, but is associated with
loss of Ser20 phosphorylation. However, these mutant p53, like polymorphic p53,
are functional and activated by oxali-Pt-induced Ser20 phosphorylation. Thus, the
potential exists for repurposing oxali-Pt or similar drugs against refractory cancers
harboring wild-type or specific mutant p53.

INTRODUCTION

(cis-Pt) or carboplatin, with a taxane. Initially, patients
exhibit a satisfactory response; however, about 80% of
patients eventually develop resistance to therapeutic drugs
resulting in the low survival rate [3, 4]. Therefore, in order
to advance Pt-based therapy and enhance ovarian cancer
responses in the clinic, studies that identify mechanisms of
Pt resistance are pertinent [5].
The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role
in facilitating favorable antitumor drug response to Pt
drugs. Under basal conditions, p53 is negatively regulated
by binding to the inhibitors Mdm2 and Mdm4, which
promote its proteosomal degradation. DNA damage by
cis-Pt or carboplatin upregulates key cellular pathways
to stabilize p53 by dissociating the Mdm2-Mdm4-p53
complex, thereby allowing p53 to translocate to the

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from
gynecological cancers among women. In 2015 over
21,000 women in the United States were diagnosed with
ovarian cancer, of whom ~67% succumbed to their death
[1]. The majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed
at an advanced stage, when the tumor has metastasized,
resulting in a 5-year survival rate below 30% [2]. The
current treatment for advanced ovarian carcinoma
involves cytoreductive surgery in order to remove the bulk
of the tumor, and since advanced ovarian cancer cannot
be eliminated by surgery alone, patients also receive
a combination of a platinum (Pt) drug, either cisplatin

nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences for
transactivation of target genes, exemplified by p21, Mdm2
and Bax [6-8]. This transcriptional activity is essential for
p53-dependent cellular effects, such as cell cycle arrest,
senescence, and programmed cell-death [9-11]. Therefore,
failure in p53 function has been identified as a significant
mechanism contributing to Pt drug resistance. Factors
reported to disrupt wild-type p53 function include i)
overexpression of negative regulator Mdm2 or Mdm4, and
ii) downregulation of kinases involved in post-translational
regulation of p53 [12]. However, the frequency of Mdm2
or Mdm4 overexpression is low (2-4%) in ovarian tumor
cells and cancer patients [13] or non-existent in cis-Ptresistant ovarian tumor cell lines [14]. Therefore, it is
possible that failure in post-translational phosphorylation
of p53 may be the more important in Pt resistance, but very
little has been reported. Normally, cis-Pt upregulates ATR,
Chk1 and Chk2 kinases, which stabilize and activate p53
by phosphorylating Ser15 and Ser20, which are considered
to be critical sites as they are located in the region of p53
that binds to Mdm2 [15-17]. Of these kinases, contribution
of Chk2 to cis-Pt resistance is possible as defects in this
kinase and p53 are reported to be mutually exclusive [18]
and Chk2 dysfunction is known to exist in several cancers
[7], including 23% of clinical ovarian cancer cases [19].
Another major cause of p53 dysfunction is
mutation in the p53 gene [20], and several clinical
studies have attempted to correlate p53 gene status with
chemotherapy response [21-23]. However, the results
have been conflicting, since wild-type or mutant p53 can
be associated with both antitumor therapeutic response
and resistance. Surprisingly, in high grade serous ovarian
cancer (HGSOC), wild-type p53 is associated with a
significantly inferior overall survival of patients [24].
These reports indicate that there is insufficient knowledge
of how wild-type p53 is inactivated and whether all
p53 mutations negatively impact p53 function and
downstream cellular processes. However, one detailed
study using the yeast functional assay (FASAY) for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

evaluating transcriptional activity of 2,314 p53 mutants
revealed that only 9.6% exhibited no activity, 26.5% had
partial activity and 63.9% expressed full activity relative
to wild-type p53 [25]. These findings demonstrate that
not all p53 mutants are inactive or dysfunctional and,
therefore, classification of p53 function goes beyond the
‘wild-type versus mutant’ genotypic correlation. More
importantly, we have previously demonstrated that in a
cis-Pt-resistant ovarian tumor model harboring mutant
p53, ionizing radiation, but not cis-Pt, induced and
activated p53 [26]. In the present study, therefore, we
have evaluated the response of wild-type or mutant p53
and its post-translational phosphorylation in well-studied
models of cis-Pt resistance [27]. Since oxaliplatin (oxaliPt) is known to circumvent cis-Pt resistance [28], this
agent was also investigated to examine if its mechanism
of action is linked to the mechanism of cis-Pt resistance.
Our study indicates that Chk2 dysfunction is prevalent
in cis-Pt-resistant cells, and the resultant loss in Ser20
phosphorylation is an important negative regulator of p53
function, both in wild-type and mutant p53 tumor cells.
However, phosphorylation of this site is restored by oxaliPt in a Chk2-independent manner to activate p53 and
circumvent cis-Pt resistance in all tumor models, and this
suggests loss of p53 phosphorylation, and not mutation,
is the main driver of cis-Pt resistance in these models of
ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
Response of cell lines and ovarian cancer patients
based on p53 status
A number of cis-Pt-resistant ovarian tumor models
have been reported, but based on our previous experience
[26, 27], 2780CP/Cl-16, OVCAR-10, HEY and OVCA433 were selected for the investigation. In addition, the

and to provide a matching pair to 2780CP/Cl-16 cells
that were derived from A2780 cells [26]. Although the
A2780 and 2780CP/Cl-16 cells are of ovarian origin, their
histological sub-type is unknown, whereas OVCAR-10

is reported as being an adenocarcinoma and Hey and
OVCA-433 as serous ovarian cancer [29]. Gene sequence
analysis has confirmed that A2780 cells harbor wild-type
p53, which is inducible and makes this cell line widely
used as a cis-Pt-sensitive model of ovarian cancer [26].

may be due to either dysfunctional wild-type p53 or

fr database. Our findings demonstrate that of 175 missense
p53 mutants in TCGA database, only one (0.6%) was fully
active against all eight p53 target gene promoters in the
FASAY system, with three (1.7%) inactive against 3-4
promoters, 19 (11%) inactive against 5-6 promoters, and
152 (87%) were inactive against 7-8 promoters (Figure
1D). These results indicate that the 2780CP/Cl-16 and
OVCAR-10 tumor models with non-functionality of p53
mutants are consistent with majority (98%) of p53 mutants
in HGSOC.
Interestingly, oxali-Pt was highly potent against
A2780 cells (IC50, 0.15 μM) and against all cis-Ptresistant cell lines, resulting in relatively low resistance
factors of 1.4-3.8 (Figure 1A and 1B). Thus, oxali-Pt is
able to circumvent 65-94% of resistance in cis-Pt-resistant
tumor models, irrespective of p53 gene (by sequencing) or
functional (by FASAY) status. To determine whether the
Pt drugs were p53-dependent, clones were selected from
cell lines after mock or p53 knockout and characterized.
Several clones were obtained from A2780 cells, but
resistant cells inexplicably yielded only few clones, with
OVCA-433 cells failing to yield any clones (data not

In contrast, the resistant models demonstrated changes in
amino acid sequence of p53 (Table 1). However, the P72R
polymorphism in Hey and OVCA-433 models, as expected
from the literature [20], does not inhibit transcriptional
activation of target gene promoters in the yeast FASAY
system (http://p53.fr). On the other hand, the V172F and
G266R mutants appear to lack p53 function in this system.
The sensitive and resistant tumor models were
evaluated for cytotoxic response to cis-Pt using the IC50
parameter to enable comparison. This evaluation indicated
that A2780 cells were sensitive to cis-Pt, as indicated by a
low IC50 value of 0.30 μM (Figure 1A). However, all four
resistant cell lines gave significantly higher IC50 values and
were, therefore, confirmed as cis-Pt resistant. The level of
resistance relative to A2780 cells varied, ranging from 11fold in HEY cells to 30-fold in OVCAR-10 cells (Figure
1B). This indicated that cis-Pt resistance was expressed
in tumor models irrespective of p53 functional status
by FASAY. However, it was important to examine the
relevance of these models to the clinical situation. Thus,
the TCGA database on ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma
(HGSOC), which is primarily treated with cis-Pt-based
chemotherapy [4], was examined for patient survival. The
results with a larger population cohort confirm a previous
report [24] that overall survival (OS) tends toward being
shorter in patients with cancers harboring wild-type p53

shown). For immunoblot analysis, clones were exposed to
drug concentrations based on IC50 derived from sensitive
A2780 cells; this avoided exposures of cells to suprapharmacologic drug concentrations. Thus, A2780 clones
were exposed to 1 μM cis-Pt or 0.6 μM oxali-Pt, and
clones from resistant cells were exposed to 5-fold higher
concentrations in order to compensate in part for lower
drug uptake in resistant cells [26]. Both drugs induced p53
and p53-dependent target p21 in control A2780 clones;
however, oxali-Pt expressed greater potency in inducing
these proteins (Figure 2A). Interestingly, oxali-Pt induced
p53 and p21 in resistant clones also, but cis-Pt had little or
no effect on p53 and p21, and this is particularly evident
in control HEY clones. Nevertheless, p53 dependence for
drug-mediated induction of p21 can be surmised from a
comparison of p21 expression between control clones and
p53 knockout (p53-/-) clones. Significantly, it is readily

evident from results with oxali-Pt that both wild-type
and mutant p53 in resistant models can be consistently
activated to upregulate p21.
To examine if cytotoxicity was also p53-dependent,
IC50 was determined in p53+/+ (control) and p53-/- clones. A
2- to 3-fold increase in IC50 for cis-Pt was demonstrated in
A2780 and 2780CP/Cl-16 p53-/- clones, but a surprisingly
significant 1.4- to 2.1-fold decrease in cis-Pt IC50 in p53-/clones derived from OVCAR-10 and HEY cells was noted
(Figure 2B). This suggests differences in cell context for
the mechanism involved in dysfunctional p53 response
to cis-Pt. However, in contrast, loss of p53 consistently
increased IC50 of oxali-Pt in p53-/- clones from all cell
lines by 2- to 11-fold. These cytotoxic data with oxali-Pt
indicating p53 dependency are in concordance with p53dependent upregulation of p21, and strongly suggests that
p53 in all cell lines is activated by this Pt analog to induce

p53 and p21 that were associated with correspondingly
robust phosphorylation of Ser15 and Ser20 (Figure 3A).
In resistant cell lines, inductions of p53 and p21 by cisPt were again attenuated in general, whereas oxali-Ptmediated inductions were substantially greater. This
is particularly apparent when comparing results from
A2780 cells and the related 2780CP/Cl-16 cells that
also correlated directly with differential Ser15 or Ser20
phosphorylation by the two drugs. In OVCAR-10 and
HEY cells, however, Ser15 phosphorylation by cis-Pt
was similar to or greater than that by oxali-Pt, whereas
Ser20 phosphorylation by oxali-Pt was consistently
greater than by cis-Pt. These differences are readily
apparent in Figure 3B where densitometry of phosphobands demonstrate that the ratio of oxali-Pt:cis-Pt is ~4
for mean Ser20 and ~1.5 for mean Ser15. Moreover,

Ser20 phosphorylation of p53 enhances its
transcriptional activity
Given that p53 in resistant cell lines may not be
activated by cis-Pt as efficiently as by oxali-Pt (Figure
2A), and that phosphorylation plays a critical role in
regulating p53 function [12], the differential ability
of these Pt compounds to induce p53 transcriptional
activity was examined at the level of post-translational
modification. Specifically, we assessed phosphorylation
of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20 sites that have been reported
as most critical for its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
functions [16, 30]. Exposure of A2780 cells to cis-Pt
and oxali-Pt again demonstrated robust inductions of

phosphorylation, correlated directly with p53 and p21
inductions in each cell line and for each drug (Figure 3A).
These results suggest that oxali-Pt efficiently induces
Ser20 phosphorylation and activates p53 function in cisPt-resistant cells. To validate p53-Ser20 phosphorylation
as enhancing its transcriptional activity, we monitored p21
levels by immunoblot in A2780 p53-/- cells transfected
with plasmids expressing wild-type p53, mutant p53S20A (constitutively dephosphorylated mimic) or mutant
p53-S20D (constitutively phosphorylated mimic). The

results in Figure 3C and 3D do indeed demonstrate that
expression of p53-S20D, which as anticipated is detectable
by Ser20-p53 antibody, increases p21 to significantly
greater levels (~2 fold) as compared to wild-type p53
or mutant p53-S20A. These results corroborate that
Ser20 phosphorylation is an important potentiator of p53
transcriptional activity.

Chk2 mediates cis-Pt-induced p53 transcriptional
activation and cis-Pt sensitivity

consistent, and confirmed our previous report [35] that
Chk2 was activated via Thr68 phosphorylation by cisPt, and to a lesser extent by oxali-Pt (Figure 4B). Chk2
knockout, on the other hand, resulted in a dramatic
decrease in p53-Ser20 phosphorylation and p21 levels
with cis-Pt. Remarkably, loss of Chk2 did not affect the
ability of oxali-Pt to induce p53-Ser20 phosphorylation
and p21 expression. Similar results were obtained by Chk2
downregulation by siRNA in A2780 cells (data not shown).
To study the effect of Chk2 in cytotoxic response, the IC50
was determined in A2780 control and Chk2-/- clones. Loss
of Chk2 led to a significant increase (~2- to 3-fold) in
cis-Pt IC50 and, therefore, cis-Pt-resistance (Figure 4C).
Conversely, ectopic re-expression of Chk2 in A2780 Chk2/clones restored cis-Pt-induced p53 transcriptional activity
(Figure 4D) and cytotoxic sensitivity (IC50: control, 0.74
vs. Chk2-ki, 0.55 μM) (Figure 4E). To assess the clinical
significance of Chk2 in modulating chemosensitivity, we
investigated the effect of Chk2 expression in Pt therapy
outcomes in HGSOC patients. For this study, we accessed
the TCGA data bank, and Pt sensitive or resistant patients
were clustered into two groups according to their Chk2
expression (high vs. low). In either group, Pt-sensitive
patients with relatively high levels of Chk2 were found to
have significantly greater overall survival by 4-11 months
(Figure 4F). However, the difference between the drug-

With attenuation of Ser20 phosphorylation by cisPt defined as a key event in cis-Pt resistance, it becomes
important to understand the underlying basis for this
observation. Pt-induced DNA damage triggers p53
phosphorylation via the activation of specific kinases [7,
31]. Studies have shown that downregulation of Chk2, a
kinase reported to phosphorylate p53 at Ser20 after cisPt treatment, leads to resistance [32-34]. In addition, our
lab has previously reported that knockdown of Chk2 in
A2780 cells reduced the ability of cis-Pt to induce p53
and p21 [35]. Therefore, we evaluated basal levels of
Chk2 by immunoblot across ovarian cancer cell lines. As
anticipated, Chk2 was expressed in sensitive A2780 cells,
but protein levels were substantially lower by 60-98% in
all cis-Pt resistant cell lines (2780CP/Cl-16, OVCAR-10,
HEY and OVCA-433) (Figure 4A). To validate decreased
levels of Chk2 as contributing to attenuated p53-Ser20
phosphorylation and transcriptional activity, we generated
A2780 Chk2-knockout (Chk2-/-) clones by CRISPR/
Cas9. Cis-Pt or oxali-Pt treatment of A2780 control clone
demonstrated that total Chk2 levels were unaffected and
that induction of p53, phospho-p53 and p21 levels were

of structural differences, cis-Pt and oxali-Pt intrastrand adducts transduce DNA damage signal along distinct pathways that converge to
phosphorylate p53 at Ser20, activate p53 and induce cell death. When Chk2 is downregulated, p53 activation by cis-Pt is inhibited and,
therefore, resistance to this drug is affected. However, oxali-Pt can restore p53 function and circumvent cis-Pt resistance by activating the
MEK1/2 kinase.

sensitive cohort expressing high Chk2 and drug-resistant
patients expressing low Chk2 was greater (26 months).
Taken together, these results indicate that Chk2 is essential
for cis-Pt-induced p53-Ser20 phosphorylation and p53
transcriptional activity, and is an important modulator of
cis-Pt chemosensitivity.

1C, presents a major therapeutic barrier. In this study,
however, we have demonstrated that the four ovarian
cancer cell lines resistant to cis-Pt, irrespective of p53
genotype, were responsive to oxali-Pt and demonstrated
low cross-resistance to this Pt analog. This cytotoxic
difference was due to the relative abilities of the two
drugs to functionally activate p53, with cis-Pt having an
attenuated or negligible effect and oxali-Pt demonstrating
a robust effect. The poor cis-Pt-dependent cytotoxicity and
lack of p53 activation was due to downregulation of Chk2
and resultant reduction in Ser20 phosphorylation, a key
event normally required to stabilize and activate p53. The
significance of Chk2 downregulation in cis-Pt resistance
was confirmed in HGSOC by reduced overall survival in
patients. This is consistent with a recent report that Chk2
is a good biomarker for Pt chemotherapy in advanced
stage HGSOC patients [34]. Oxali-Pt, on the other hand,
was not dependent on Chk2 in our study and activated p53
via an independent kinase, which appears to be MEK1/2.
Although Chk2 activated by cis-Pt has been reported to
phosphorylate Ser20 [33] and its knock-down in A2780
cells reduces the ability of cis-Pt to induce p21 in a p53dependent manner [35], MEK1/2 has not been associated
previously with phosphorylation at Ser20. Therefore, this
regulation of p53 by MEK1/2 is a novel observation.
The differential effect of cis-Pt and oxali-Pt in
functionally activating p53 in resistant cells is consistent
with the two Pt-based drugs having independent
mechanisms of action. Although both drugs target DNA
and form identical intrastrand crosslinks, primarily G-G
adducts, the effects of these adducts are distinct due to
structural differences, as shown in Figure 6. Biochemical
studies have demonstrated that the structural variation
between cis-Pt and oxali-Pt adducts is sufficient to induce
significant differences in the degree of DNA bending and
unwinding [40]. These drug-dependent local distortions in
damaged DNA are, therefore, recognized independently
by specialized proteins, such as specific members of the
high mobility group box (HMGB) and mismatch repair
(MMR) families that bind only cis-Pt-DNA adducts, but
not oxali-Pt adducts [41]. The specificity of recognition
proteins likely dictates upregulation of the individual
kinase involved in activation of p53 function (Figure 6).
This understanding is consistent with the multiplicity of
kinases involved in phosphorylation of individual amino
acid residue, including Ser20, for p53 regulation [7], and
has also been demonstrated in Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT)
cells, which have defective ATM kinase. Thus, p53 in AT
cells is not responsive to DNA strand breaks by ionizing
radiation due to loss of ATM kinase, but its regulation is
restored by DNA adducts induced by ultraviolet radiation
or cis-Pt that instead activate the intact, closely-related
ATR kinase [42, 43].
Transcriptional activity of p53 is inhibited by
its binding to Mdm2 and Mdm4, but is essential for
its function, which is affected via post-translational

Oxali-Pt induces p53-Ser20 via MEK1/2
In this study, oxali-Pt has demonstrated the
capacity to restore p53-Ser20 phosphorylation and p53
transcriptional activity independently of Chk2, but the
kinase involved in this Ser20 modification is not known
and requires attention. We have previously demonstrated
that p53-dependent induction of p21 by an oxali-Pt-like
analog DACH-diacetato-dichloro-Pt(IV) was inhibited by
the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin [14]. However, PI3-K is
not known to phosphorylate p53, but wortmannin can also
inhibit MAPKs [36], which may then impact p53 function.
Specifically, MAPK members ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 can
transcriptionally activate p53 [37, 38] and MEK inhibitor
U0126 is reported to induce cis-Pt resistance [39]. Based
on this collective evidence, phosphorylation of Ser20 by
MAPK can be rationalized. For this reason, we explored
ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 inhibitors to provisionally examine
their potential to phosphorylate p53 at Ser20. However,
treatment of 2780CP/Cl-16 cells with the ERK1/2selective ATP-competitive inhibitor (ERKi) SCH772984
did not impact the ability of oxali-Pt to induce p53Ser20 phosphorylation or p21 expression, even though it
inhibited phospho-ERK and Ser15 phosphorylation by cisPt (Figure 5A). On the other hand, oxali-Pt-induced p53Ser20 phosphorylation and p21 transactivation in 2780CP/
Cl-16 cells were inhibited by the selective MEK1/2
inhibitors (MEKi) U0126 and PD98059 (Figures 5B and
5C). Since MEK1/2-mediated p53-Ser20 phosphorylation
is not readily evident from the literature, we investigated
the potential of this kinase to phosphorylate p53-Ser20
directly. We included Chk2 immunoprecipitate isolated
from A2780 cells treated with cis-Pt as a positive control.
Indeed, active recombinant MEK1, MEK2 and Chk2 were
able to phosphorylate p53 at the Ser20 site (Figure 5D).
This demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that
MEK1/2 has the potential to directly phosphorylate p53 at
the Ser20 site.

DISCUSSION
The p53 pathway when functionally activated
through post-translational modifications plays a major role
in mediating Pt chemotherapy response. Therefore, it is not
surprising that loss of p53 function through mutation has
been identified as an important mechanism leading to cisPt resistance [20, 31]. In HGSOC, the high p53 mutation
rate of 86%, based on TCGA data shown in Figure

to cis-Pt and oxali-Pt, and loss of this post-translational
phosphorylation in absence of Chk2 prevents p53
activation by cis-Pt and this leads to drug resistance.
However, cis-Pt resistance can be circumvented by
oxali-Pt via activation of MEK1/2, which restores
Ser20 phosphorylation of p53. More significantly, Ser20
phosphorylation of specific p53 mutants with oxali-Pt also
activates p53 function, and this raises the likelihood that
other p53 mutants in refractory human ovarian cancers
could also be functionally activated with distinct drugs,
such as oxali-Pt, to restore therapeutic sensitivity.

phosphorylations that disrupt the Mdm2-Mdm4-p53
complex and release p53 [7]. Although several sites in p53
are amenable to phosphorylation following DNA damage,
modifications at Ser15 and Ser20 are reported as most
critical for its anti-proliferative and apoptotic functions
[15-17]. However, in our present study, p53-Ser20
phosphorylation appeared to correlate consistently with
p21 transactivation and drug cytotoxicity in all cell lines.
Since Mdm2 has E3 ligase activity and Mdm4 is reported
to inhibit p53 transactivation [44-46], it is possible that
Ser15 phosphorylation is significant for disrupting
Mdm2 binding and/or E3 ligase activity to promote p53
stabilization, with Ser20 phosphorylation becoming
important for disrupting Mdm4 binding that then enables
p53 to interact with p300 coactivator, which is required
for p53 transactivation function [17, 45, 47]. This is in
agreement with the report that Ser15 phosphorylation is
more effective in stabilizing p53 [48].
An important discovery in our study was the
substantial cis-Pt resistance in the four cell lines whether
they harbored wild-type (polymorphic) or mutant p53. The
fact that both wild-type or mutant p53 in these resistant
cells was functionally activated by oxali-Pt indicates that
V172F and G266R mutations found in 2780CP/Cl-16
and/or OVCAR-10 cells were not inactivating, although
the p53 functional FASAY database predicted these p53
mutants as inactive. The reason for this discrepancy is
not known, but it is possible that Ser20 phosphorylation
by oxali-Pt may alter the p53 configuration in a manner
that restores its transactivation function in human tumor
cells. However, this may not entirely be the case since our
recent report has demonstrated that the V172F-p53 mutant
can upregulate p21 in absence of Ser20 phosphorylation
when 2780CP/Cl-16 cells are challenged with the MDM2
inhibitor nutlin-3 [49]. Our data nonetheless indicate that
the specific mutations per se were not the inactivating
event, but rather the loss of Ser20 phosphorylation due
to downregulation of Chk2 in the four cell lines was the
primary driver of resistance of the cell lines to cis-Pt. This
is consistent with reduced response rate [34] or reduced
overall survival (this study) in HGSOC patients as a result
of low Chk2 expression. The functional competency of
the specific p53 mutants in our study is also consistent
with a reported detailed analysis demonstrating that
of 2,314 distinct missense p53 mutants, almost 64%
retained p53 activity comparable to that of wild-type
p53 [25]. This raises the intriguing possibility that some
of the p53 mutants in HGSOC that were identified as
functionally inactive from our FASAY databank mining
may in fact be functional. In a similar manner, the data
with HEY and OVCA-433 suggests that cis-Pt resistance
in clinical tumors harboring polymorphic/wild-type p53
may also be at the level of a defect in post-translational
phosphorylation at Ser20.
In summary, our present study demonstrates that
Ser20 phosphorylation of p53 dictates cytotoxic response

Generation of stable gene-knockout clones by
CRISPR

A pellet corresponding to 1 x 106 cells was washed
with ice cold PBS, and DNA extracted using the QIAamp®
DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Extracted DNA was quantified using the
NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA samples
were submitted for TP53 sequencing to the Sequencing
and Microarray Core Facility at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

CRISPR plasmids TP53 (HS0000019748,
NM_001126117),
CHEK2
(HS0000041294,
NM_001005735) and universal negative control
(CRISPR08) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells
at 70% confluence in T75 flask were transfected with 25
μg of CRISPR/Cas-GFP plasmid using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. After 48 hr transfection, GFP
positive cells were sorted using the BD FACSAria™
cell sorter (BD Biosciences), collected and grown in
T75 flasks. At 80% confluence, cells were trypsinized
and diluted aliquots of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 cells
were grown in 10-cm dishes. Single clones from the 10cm dishes were selected, grown in 12-well plates and
characterized for knockout through Western blot analysis.

Cytotoxic evaluations
The procedure employed for cytotoxic evaluations
was adapted from our previous report [51]. Ovarian cancer
cells growing in tissue culture dishes were trypsinized,
diluted to appropriate concentrations, and 100 μL/well
aliquots plated in 96-well plates to achieve the following
densities: A2780, 200 cells/well; 2780CP/Cl-16, 500 cells/
well; OVCAR-10, 500 cells/well; HEY, 150 cells/well;
and OVCA-433, 300 cells/well. Plates were incubated
overnight at 37ºC. Aliquots of 100 μL serially-diluted
solutions of Pt drugs in medium were then added to ach
well. Plates were further incubated at 37ºC for 5 days.
After this time, 50 μL of an MTT solution (3 mg/mL) was
added to each well and plates were incubated for 4 hr. The
medium was removed and purple MTT formazan crystals
were dissolved in 100 μL 100% DMSO. Plates were
shaken for 5-10 min and absorbance measured at 570 nm
with a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). IC50 values were
determined from the sigmoidal plot of % cell survival vs.
drug concentration using commercial software (GraphPad
Prism v.6; La Jolla, CA, USA).

Western blot analysis
Cells were scraped and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm
and 4°C for 1 min. Cell pellets were resuspended and
sonicated in 50-100 µL ice-cold extraction buffer (50
mM Tris HCl; pH 7.4), 10 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 150
mM NaCl) with 0.5% NP-40 and 2 mM phosphatase
inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm
at 4°C for 10 min. Supernatants were isolated, quantified
for protein concentration by BCA assay and processed
for immunoblotting. A 50 μg aliquot of protein extracts
were run on a 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE ready gel,
electrophoretically transferred for 1 hr at 300 mA to
a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% milk for
1 hr, and probed with primary antibody overnight and
secondary antibody for 1 hr. Finally, blots were developed
by chemiluminescence. For densitometric analysis of the
band, the X-ray films were scanned and the signals were
analyzed using the Image J software.

Transfections
The p53 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr.
Mickey C.-T. Hu (Stanford University School of Medicine,
Stanford, CA, USA). A 0.5 µg of p53, 1 µg of S20A or
0.5 µg of S20D plasmid aliquot was transfected into
A2780-p53-/- cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies) for 48 hr, following the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The Chk2 plasmid
(2 µg), a gift from Dr. Junjie Chen (The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA),
was similarly transfected into A2780-Chk2-/- cells. After
48 hr transfection, cells were treated with Pt drugs and
collected 24 hr later for immunoblot analysis. For IC50
analysis, cells were trypsinized after 24 hr of transfection
and were subjected to the above described cytotoxic
MTT evaluation procedure using a 3-day drug exposure
protocol.

Phosphorylation at Ser20-p53 by MAPK
2780CP/Cl-16 cells were seeded into 6-well
plates and incubated overnight at 37ºC. Cells were then
treated for 1 hr with DMSO, 1.5 µM of ERK1/2 inhibitor
SCH772984, 100 µM of MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 or 10
µM of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. After 1 hr, cells were
treated with 5 μM cis-Pt or 3 μM oxali-Pt and collected 24
hr later for immunoblot analysis.
For MEK-mediated phosphorylation, 25 μM of ATP
(Sigma-Aldrich), 12.5 ng/μL of recombinant p53 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 ng/μL of active recombinant
MEK-1 or MEK-2 (SignalChem) were added in a 1.5 mL
microfuge tube. Immunoprecipitated Chk2 from A2780
cells treated with cis-Pt 1 μM was used as a positive

of ATP and 12.5 ng/μL of recombinant p53. Reaction
Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MnCl2, 6 mM MgCl2, 10%
(v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM Na3VO4, 50
mM HEPES (pH 7.5)) was then added for a final volume
reaction of 25 μL. The reaction was incubated at 30ºC
for 20 min. After this time, the mixture was examined by
immunoblot analysis.

Analysis of patient survival
The reverse phase protein array (RPPA) Level
3 data for Chk2 in patients with ovarian serous
cystadenocarcinoma (HGSOC) was accessed from the
TCGA (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/). Overall survival
information, response to Pt and TP53 mutation status
were retrieved from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.
org/). The analyses were carried out in R (version 3.2.2).
All tests were two-sided and considered statistically
significant at the 0.05 level. The Log-rank test assessed
association between TP53 mutation status (wild-type
vs. mutant) and overall survival, as depicted in KaplanMeyer curves. Patients were grouped as platinum resistant
and platinum sensitive cohorts, taking into account the
classification-system based on the platinum free interval.
The cohorts were further stratified into high and low Chk2
RPPA level groups at percentile cutoffs between 0.25 and
0.75 with a step of 0.01. The optimal cutoff percentile
(as determined by differences in median survival time
between different groups) was identified for ChK2 and
Kaplan-Meier plots generated.

Predicted functionality of mutant p53

REFERENCES

Mutations of p53 in tumors of HGSOC patients
from the TCGA database and in ovarian cancer cell lines
were evaluated for their effect on p53 function using the
yeast FASAY data stored in a p53 database (http://p53.fr).
The mutation was assessed against eight gene promoters
targeted by wild-type, and the number of promoters
activated by each mutant p53 was quantified.
