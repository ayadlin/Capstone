ABSTRACT:
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, and
represents a significant clinical challenge in pediatric oncology, since overall survival
currently remains under 70%. Patients with tumors overexpressing MYC or harboring
a MYC oncogene amplification have an extremely poor prognosis. Pharmacologically
inhibiting MYC expression may, thus, have clinical utility given its pathogenetic role in
medulloblastoma. Recent studies using the selective small molecule BET inhibitor, JQ1,
have identified BET bromodomain proteins, especially BRD4, as epigenetic regulatory
factors for MYC and its targets. Targeting MYC expression by BET inhibition resulted
in antitumoral effects in various cancers. Our aim here was to evaluate the efficacy of
JQ1 against preclinical models for high-risk MYC-driven medulloblastoma. Treatment
of medulloblastoma cell lines with JQ1 significantly reduced cell proliferation and
preferentially induced apoptosis in cells expressing high levels of MYC. JQ1 treatment
of medulloblastoma cell lines downregulated MYC expression and resulted in a
transcriptional deregulation of MYC targets, and also significantly altered expression
of genes involved in cell cycle progression and p53 signalling. JQ1 treatment prolonged
the survival of mice harboring medulloblastoma xenografts and reduced the tumor
burden in these mice. Our preclinical data provide evidence to pursue testing BET
inhibitors, such as JQ1, as molecular targeted therapeutic options for patients with
high-risk medulloblastomas overexpressing MYC or harboring MYC amplifications.

INTRODUCTION

leading cause of cancer-related mortality in childhood
[1]. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
brain tumor in children and still presents a significant
challenge to treat, with an overall survival under 70%
[2]. Four subgroups with distinct clinical, biological

and genetic profiles are now recognized, namely, WNT,
SHH, group 3 and group 4 [3]. WNT as well as Group 3
tumors express high MYC levels [3]. Group 3 is the most
aggressive subgroup and typically expresses the highest
MYC levels, with MYC amplifications occurring almost
exclusively in this subgroup [4-6]. This most aggressive
form of medulloblastoma portends a dismal prognosis,
and generates a high proportion of aggressive, invasive
and metastasizing tumors [4, 5, 7, 8]. Group 3 tumors are
usually resistant to even multimodal treatment consisting
of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Thus, the
integration of molecular targeted therapies into current
treatment protocols and adjustment of conventional
treatment is urgently needed to improve survival in
patients with high-risk medulloblastoma without
compromising long-term quality of life after treatment. As
high-level MYC expression may drive the most aggressive
characteristic of medulloblastomas, targeted inhibition of
MYC should have clinical utility.
Posttranslational histone modifications are crucial
for the modulation of chromatin structure and regulation
of transcription [9]. Deregulation of these epigenetic
modifications is common among cancer cells, and can
lead to overexpression of oncogenes [10]. Bromodomains
recognize acetylated lysines in the N-terminal regions
of histones and, thus, function as chromatin readers [11]
within the read-write-erase concept for the transfer of
epigenetic information. Proteins containing reader domains
recruit enzymes that add or remove posttranslational
modifications, the writers and erasers, respectively, to the
chromatin at areas of lysine modification. The BET protein
family contain tandem bromodomains and an extraterminal
or ET domain [12]. Human BET family members include
BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT [12]. BRD2, BRD3 and
BRD4 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas, BRDT is
localized primarily to the testis [13]. The BRD2 and BRD3
proteins have been shown to regulate the transcription of
growth-promoting genes such as CCND1, suggesting that
they have reinforcing roles on controlling proliferative
expansion [14]. BRD4 is a well-established regulator of
the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a
complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9)
and cyclin T, among other polypeptides [15]. Through its
interaction with BRD4, P-TEFb is recruited to promoters
to phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of the
large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Functional studies
have suggested that BRD4 plays an important role in
regulating growth-associated genes at the M/G1 boundary
by retaining P-TEFb at the promoters of key regulatory
genes throughout mitosis [16, 17]. Furthermore, P-TEFb
is recruited to MYC and MYC target gene promotors as
an important step for MYC-dependent stimulation of
response genes. One such response gene is CAD, which
encodes a protein containing the first three enzyme
activities of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, carbamyl
phosphate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamylase and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dihydro-orotase [18, 19]. In summary, BET proteins play
an important role in controlling proliferation and cell cycle
progression, making them interesting targets for cancer
therapy.
Several reports in the last two years have
demonstrated antitumorigenic activities of the small
molecule BET bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, in preclinical
models of hematological malignancies and neuroblastoma
[20-22]. JQ1 binds competitively to bromodomains to
displace them from acetylated histones, and shows highest
potency and specificity towards BRD4, with weaker
binding to BRD2, BRD3 and BRDT [23]. Intriguingly,
BRD4 was shown to bind to histones in the MYC promoter
region itself and play a critical role in MYC expression in
human cancer cells such that inhibition of BET with JQ1
resulted in a remarkable diminution of MYC expression,
decreased BRD4 binding to the MYC promotor and
associated cell death [20, 21]. Inhibition of the BRD4
protein by JQ1, thus, proved to have effective antitumoral
properties, suggesting that targeting MYC expression is
feasible in selected cancers [20, 21].
With the aim of exploring molecular targeted
therapeutic options for high-risk medulloblastomas,
we analyzed whether inhibiting BET bromodomain
proteins, and thereby targeting MYC and its target
genes, could be effective against preclinical models of
medulloblastoma. We hypothesized that especially highrisk medulloblastomas, which overexpress MYC, could
benefit from BET inhibition. To provide proof-of-principle
that BET inhibition is therapeutically useful against
medulloblastoma, we assessed the efficacy of JQ1 against
medulloblastoma cells grown in cell culture models and as
xenografts in nude mice.

RESULTS
BRD4 is expressed in primary medulloblastomas
and human medulloblastoma cell lines
BRD4 was previously shown to be the most
sensitive of all BET proteins to JQ1 treatment in in
vitro pharmacological assays. We therefore assessed
BRD4 expression in primary medulloblastomas and
normal cerebellar tissue, as a control. BRD4 was
immunohistochemically detected in samples from 115
primary medulloblastomas from pediatric patients, 14
cerebellum samples previously arrayed into a tissue
microarray and 2 samples from primary medulloblastomas
from adult patients. High-level BRD4 expression were
detected in 99 of 115 pediatric primary medulloblastomas
(75%) and in both adult medulloblastoma samples (Fig.
1A, I-III). BRD4 was only marginally (22%) expressed in
normal cerebellar tissue (Fig. 1A, IV and supplementary
Fig. 1). We also evaluated BRD4 expression in a panel
2081

of medulloblastoma cell lines that included HD-MB3,
ONS-76, UW-228, Daoy, D-341 and D-283. All cell
lines strongly expressed BRD4 (Fig.1 B), except for
Daoy, which expressed lower BRD4 levels. Robinson,
et al. previously published global mRNA expression
profiles from 76 primary medulloblastomas and 9 normal
cerebellar samples performed on Affymetrix chips [24].
We re-analyzed these data, and detected significantly
higher BRD3 expression levels in medulloblastomas
compared to normal human cerebellum (P <0.01).
BRD2 and BRD4 were both expressed in all primary
medulloblastomas in this medulloblastoma cohort,
however, expression was not significantly higher than
in cerebellar tissue. Taken together, BRD2, BRD3 and
BRD4 are expressed in primary medulloblastomas. All
medulloblastoma subgroups strongly expressed BRD4,
with the highest expression detected in the shh subgroup
(see supplementary Fig. 2). While expression of only
BRD3 was elevated in tumors from the cohort analyzed,
BRD4 expression was significantly higher in tissue
samples from a separate medulloblasoma cohort as well

as in cell lines derived from human medulloblastomas,
indicating that mRNA expression may not be the best
measure of protein activity and targetability in this case.
The one prerequisite for our study assessing JQ1 efficacy
against medulloblastoma, that its primary target be
expressed, was fulfilled not only in our preclinical models
but also in primary medulloblastoma samples.

JQ1 reduces cell viability and proliferation and
induces apoptosis and senescence in human
medulloblastoma cell lines
To investigate the impact of JQ1 treatment on
typical tumorigenic properties, we assessed viability,
proliferation, apoptosis and senescence in the
medulloblastoma cell lines, HD-MB3, Daoy, UW-228,
ONS-76, D-283 and D-341, in culture. MTT assays were
conducted after 48-120h of JQ1 treatment to assess cell
viability. JQ1 treatment significantly reduced viabiltiy
in medulloblastoma cells in culture (Fig. 2 A-C). Fifty
percent inhibition of growth (IC50) in our cell line panel
was observed at JQ1 concentrations between 78nM and
>1µM (Fig. 2A). Lowest IC50 values occurred primarily
after 72h of treatment. Interestingly, the MYC-amplified
HD-MB3 cell line was among the most sensitive to JQ1
treatment. The Daoy and UW-228 cell lines were least
sensitive to JQ1 with IC50 values well above 1µM.
In comparison to the other cell lines, Daoy and UW228, harbor TP53 mutations. Previous studies using
RNAi showed that the BET family member, BRD4,
is required for transition through the cell cycle [16].
Consistent with this observation, cell cycle analysis in
our medulloblastoma cell line panel revealed an increase
in the percentage of cells in G1 after JQ1 exposure (Fig.
2D). These data suggest that BET bromodomain inhibition
perturbs cells at the G1/S border. Treatment with JQ1
also increased the population of sub-G1 cells, suggesting
that JQ1 induces apoptosis in a fraction of cells in the
population (Fig. 2D). Analysis of treated cells using the
cell death detection ELISATM produced similar findings.
The fraction of apoptotic cells was significant higher
after JQ1 treatment in all cell lines except D-283 (Fig.
2E). JQ1 produced the strongest apoptotic response in
the MYC-amplified cell lines, HD-MB3 and D-341. JQ1
treatment also enhanced cell senescence in most of the six
medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2F). Cell proliferation
was analyzed using BrdU incorporation 72h after
treatment, and showed significantly reduced proliferative
capacity in most of the six medulloblastoma cell lines
after JQ1 treatment (Fig. 2G). Taken together, the BET
bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, induces cell cycle arrest,
senecence and apoptosis with a range of sensitivity across
a panel of medulloblastoma cells.

may significantly contribute to the growth inhibitory
effects mediated by BET bromodomain inhibition.
MYC is known to interact with the CAD promotor and
increase expression of CAD, which encodes enzymes for
pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis [19]. We assessed
MYC, CAD expression using real-time RT-PCR in time
course in HD-MB3 cells treated with JQ1 to evaluate
the temporal relationship between MYC suppression and
CAD downregulation in cell lines treated with JQ1. MYC
expression declined from 6h to 24h, where it reached its
low point, and then recovered slightly to an intermediate,
but significantly reduced level (Fig. 3B). This slight

genetic backgrounds, and measured MYC and MYC target
gene expression using real-time RT-PCR. JQ1 treatment
reduced MYC transcript levels in all cell lines regardless
of MYC status (Fig. 3A and 3B). MYC expression was
reduced by over 80% in the MYC-amplified cell line,
HD-MB3 (Fig. 3A and 3B). The reduction in MYC
transcript levels in cell lines treated with BET inhibitor
was also recapitulated at the protein for MYC (Fig. 3C).
Since MYC is known to drive proliferative activity,
transcriptional reprogramming via MYC suppression

recovery may be due to known autoregulatory feedback
circuits of MYC [25]. CAD expression was also initially
repressed, and mirrored the constant MYC decline from
6h to 24h, but then recovered almost to control level
expression by 96h (Fig. 3D). Considering the observed
defects in cell cycle progression at G1/S border we also
analysed CCND1 expression in time course. In contrast

to MYC and CAD, CCND1 was repressed with a slight
delay, beginning at 12h, but was continuously repressed
to approximately 10% of control cells by 72h, where it
remained for the rest of the time course (Fig. 3E). These
observations support MYC downregulation as a primary
effector of growth inhibition by BET inhibition in MYCdriven tumor cells.

TP53 status for JQ1 efficacy. We generated the HD-MB3p53DN cell line, and treated these with JQ1. Sensitivity
to JQ1 was diminished by enforced expression of the
dominant-negative TP53 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, enforced
expression of the dominant-negative TP53 mutant
completely abolished the ability of JQ1 (500nM, 72h) to
induce apoptosis (Fig. 5B). These findings further support
the functional importance of TP53 status for JQ1 efficacy
in medulloblatoma cells.
A number of key G1-associated cell cycle genes
were deregulated in HDMB-3 cells after 24h of JQ1
treatment. This result is consistent with our observation
of defective cell cycle progression in JQ1-treated
medulloblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2D) as well as the
dramatic supression of CCND1 expression in HD-MB3
cells treated in time course (Fig. 3E). Taken together,
our data support that JQ1 treatment deregulates the MYC
program as well as the cell cycle and p53 pathways in
medullloblastoma cells.

Given the broad activity of JQ1 in medulloblastoma
cells, we sought to identify potential mechanisms that
could explain these phenotypic responses. We performed
expression profiling of HD-MB3 cells lines treated with
JQ1 or DMSO control medium using Affymetrix arrays.
Cells were treated for 24h with 500nM JQ1 to identify
early, and potentially direct, transcriptional targets of
JQ1 treatment. Data were normalized, then the average
differential expression score from the data was used
to determine genes affected by JQ1 treatment. A total
of 239 and 474 genes were up- and downregulated
(p-value < 0.001 and pfp < 0.05), respectively, after JQ1
treatment. The top 50 differentially up- and downregulated
genes are depicted in the heatmap (Fig. 4A). Using R2
Database (http://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi),
we compared most deregulated genes upon (+)-JQ1
treatment with a set of KEGG-Pathways to find pathways
most significantly enriched with those genes. 368 out of
2787 pathways met our criteria of t-test p < 0.001. The
top 3 pathways identified in this analysis were DNA
replication, cell cycle and the p53 pathway, with a 32-47%
overlap and p<2.8e-08 (Fig. 4B). Next we used GSEA
to assess the effects of JQ1 on transcriptional programs
regulated by MYC, the E2F family, cell cycle and TP53.
We interrogated our data for the statistically significant
enrichment of published, validated gene signatures. The
majority of gene sets associated with MYC, cell cycle, the
E2F family and TP53 were statistically enriched among
the genes that were downregulated by BET inhibition
in HD-MB3 cells (Fig. 4C). As medulloblastoma cell
lines harboring TP53 mutations were less responsive
towards JQ1 treatment than those with wildtype TP53,
we further investigated the functional implication of

BRD4 knockdown phenocopies the effects of JQ1
treatment in medulloblastoma cells
Previous studies have focused on the role of the
specific BET family member, BRD4, which is most
selectively inhibited by JQ1. Moreover, a recent siRNA
screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with MYC
overexpression revealed BRD4 as a candidate gene [26].
Therefore, we transiently transfected the HD-MB3 cell
line with two siRNAs directed against BRD4 or with
transfection control alone and examined the effect of
BRD4 knockdown on the same tumorigenic parameters
we assessed after JQ1 treatment. A significant knockdown
of BRD4 was achieved on both the mRNA and protein
levels 72h after transfection (Fig. 6A+B). As we observed
following JQ1 treatment, BRD4 knockdown resulted in a

downregulation of MYC mRNA and protein expression
in real-time RT-PCR and western blots, respectively
(Fig. 6A+B). Cell viability of HD-MB3 was significantly
reduced and the fraction of apoptotic cells was elevated
after transfection with both siRNAs (Fig. 6C+D). The
siRNA siBRD4(2) more effectively knocked down BRD4
expression on protein level than siBRD4(1). We, therefore,
decided to monitor cells transfected with siBRD4(2) or
control siRNA for 190h using the Xcelligance system.
HD-MB3 cells transfected with siBRD4(2) proliferated
more slowly than cells transfected with control siRNA
(Fig. 6C). Taken together, BRD4 knockdown reduced
both MYC expression and viability in the group 3-derived
medulloblastoma cell line, HD-MB3, and therefore,
phenocopies the effects of JQ1 treatment.

To further investigate the antitumor effects of BET
inhibition in vivo, we explored a xenograft model of
high-risk medulloblastoma. We used the most recently
established group 3 cell line, HD-MB3, to recapitulate
the tumor biology of this subgroup as closely as possible.
HD-MB3 cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flanks of immunocompromised mice. After palpable
xenograft tumors were established, JQ1 was administered
intraperitoneally to 7 mice once a day at 50 mg/kg body
weight for a total of 28 days or until tumor size exceeded
1000mm3. A cohort of 7 mice harboring xenograft tumors
were injected with vehicle alone in the same injection

volume was significantly smaller in the JQ1-treated group
from day 4 onward to day 14 (Fig. 7C). Intensified JQ1
treatment consistently downregulated MYC expression at
both mRNA and protein levels in HD-MB3 tumors (Fig.
7D). Immunohistological examination of xenograft tumors
showed that JQ1 increased the number of apoptotic cells
and reduced the number of proliferating cells in tumors

same level of MYC and MYC downregulation after JQ1
treatment as cell lines which responded well to JQ1. The
other cell line (UW-228) with a minor response to JQ1, did
not express detectable MYC levels in western blots. Thus,
poor JQ1 response in UW-228 can probably be attributed
to the absence, at this level of detection, of the primary
drug target from the cellular background. Interestingly,
both the UW-228 and Daoy cell lines harbor TP53
mutations. Combining these results with our expression
profiling findings, we hypothesize that the mutant TP53
could impede response to JQ1. To substantiate p53
dependance of JQ1 effects, we showed that enforced
expression of a dominant-negative TP53 mutant in a cell
line formerly sensitive to JQ1 treatment impaired the JQ1
effect. These results are concordant with observations
recently published by Shwu-Yuan Wu et al., who described
important interactions between BRD4 and TP53 [11].
They showed that BRD4 bound to and recruited TP53
to promoters of genes known to be regulated by TP53.
Fewer than 10% of sporadic medulloblastomas harbor
TP53 mutations [30]. However, MDM2 amplification or
overexpression, which increases TP53 degradation, is
frequently observed in medulloblastomas with wildtype
TP53 [31]. Based on these observations and previous
work where we demonstrated that pharmacologically
inhibiting MDM2 in medulloblastoma cells with wildtype
TP53 reactivated p53 activity, it may be advantageous to
investigate possible synergies between JQ1 and MDM2
inhibitors, such as nutlin-3 [32]. As TP53 mutations are
among the most recurrent alterations in human cancer
entities, additional evidence of the dependence of the
activity of BET inhibition on TP53 status should be further
investigated in other tumor entities as well.
Looking at previous studies, BET inhibition appears
to be highly selective and affect only a few genes. One
compelling feature of JQ1 is the ability to effectively
downregulate MYC [20], which is a gene long thought
to be difficult if not impossible to target. JQ1 was highly
effective against preclinical models of several types of
cancers with recurrent MYC amplifications, including
acute myeloid leukemia, Burkitt’s lymphoma and multiple
myeloma, and efficacy was directly related to the extent
of MYC suppression by treatment [20, 21]. Supporting
these previous findings, medulloblastoma cells exhibited
a similar reduction of MYC expression following BET
inhibition here, and the strongest apoptotic induction
occurred in MYC-amplified cell lines. We also observed
downstream effects of MYC suppression. CAD, a gene
known to be regulated by MYC and BRD4, expression
was similarly downregulated after JQ1 treatment. This
may have resulted from a direct inhibitory effect of JQ1
on the interaction of BRD4 with the CAD promoter in
addition to the secondary effect of MYC downregulation.
Taken together, BET inhibition via JQ1 downregulates
MYC as well as MYC targets in medulloblastoma cells.

DISCUSSION
Medulloblastoma is the most common brain tumor
in children and arises from primitive neural cells of the
cerebellum [1]. The majority of children with high-risk
disease succumb to medulloblastoma despite intensive
chemotherapy, surgery and radiation [2]. Moreover,
surviving patients often suffer from long-term sequelae
due to the aggressive treatment regimens. Targeted
treatment approaches are, thus, clearly needed for these
patients. The important role of the MYC oncogene in
high-risk medulloblastoma tumorigenesis makes it a
compelling, though until recently undruggable, target for
drug development. Here we show that selectively targeting
MYC using JQ1, a small molecule inhibiting BET
bromodomains, displayed broad antineoplastic effects in
medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo.
It was reported that siRNA knockdown of BRD4,
the main target of JQ1, reduces expression of key G1- and
growth-associated genes, leading to cell cycle arrest in
G1 and apoptosis in HeLa cells [16]. The same effect was
observed in previous studies examining the effect of BET
inhibition in different cancer entities [20, 21, 27, 28]. Here
we show that targeting BRD4 either pharmaceutically with
JQ1 or by siRNA knockdown was effective at reducing
the viability of medulloblastoma cell lines. As has been
described before in cells derived from other tumor entities,
we showed here that JQ1 induced medulloblastoma cells to
accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The highest
incidence of apoptosis occurred in cells harboring MYC
amplifications, namely HD-MB3 and D-341, indicating
the importance of MYC status for JQ1 efficacy [29].
Interestingly, in cell lines in which JQ1 did not induce
apoptosis, induction of senescence was observed. Cell
lines differed considerably in respect to their sensitivity
to JQ1. Until now, the capability and capacity to respond
to JQ1 has primarily been attributed to the extent of
endogenous MYC expression [28]. In glioblastoma though,
Cheng et al (2013) postulated that p21 provided partial
protection against JQ1 when genetically manipulated
[27]. Interestingly, one cell line (Daoy) with only a minor
response to JQ1 treatment in our study, expressed lower
levels of BRD4 than the other cell lines. Inconsistant with
the assumption that this lower BRD4 expression may
be causal for the reduced sensitivity, Daoy exhibited the

mechanisms of BET bromodomains, we performed
expression profiling of medulloblastoma cells with and
without JQ1 treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis using
KEGG pathways revealed that targets affected by BET
inhibition were involved in cell cycle progression, the p53
pathway and DNA replication. This fits our observation
that JQ1 appears to disrupt the cell cycle by inducing G1
arrest and apoptosis. We also observed that expression
of two key factors in G1 progression, cyclin D1 and
E2F1, were repressed, mirroring the reduction in MYC
expression, by JQ1 treatment. Since siRNA-mediated
depletion of the BRD2 BET protein has been described
to reduce transcription of cyclin D1 in human cells [14],
we investigated the result of siRNA-mediated BRD4
knockdown on CCND1 regulation in medulloblastoma
cells. BRD4 knockdown reduced CCND1 expression
similarly to JQ1 treatment. Although investigation into
the mechanisms by which BRD4 influences cyclin D1
expression was beyond the scope of this paper, further
investigation of this interaction could be of clinical
relevance, considering the importence of the cyclin D
family in tumor maintenance [33]. Our findings suggest
that not only MYC, but a variety of genes involved with the
p53 pathway and in cell cycle control are affected by JQ1
treatment. These results are concordant with previously
published results for JQ1 action on neuroblastoma cells,
which described supression of a variety of genes including
the E2F family [28]. These new insights implicate the BET
protein family in the fine control of cell cycle regulation
and progression, emphasizing the benefit of further
functional investigation of this family for tumorigenic
control mechanisms.
With the aim to generate preclinical evidence
for JQ1 efficacy in an animal model for high-risk
medulloblastoma, we treated subcutaneous xenografts
of cells derived from a group 3 medulloblastoma in
nude mice with JQ1. Given that JQ1 has no difficulty
passing the blood-brain barrier, JQ1 should have similar
effects on tumors regardless of their localization, and not
present a problem for reaching medulloblastoma in the
brain. However, testing in orthotopic medulloblastoma
models could provide additional preclinical information
prior to entry into clinical trials. The HD-MB3 cell line
is well-described and one of the few medulloblastoma
cell lines originating from a MYC-amplified group 3
tumor [34]. We only used this cell line, since this model
is recently established, and is most probably the closest
recapitulation of Group 3 medulloblastoma biology when
compared to more established cell lines [34]. JQ1 potently
inhibited xenograft tumor growth, using these cells, and
significantly prolonged mouse survival. Similarly to our in
vitro findings, JQ1 reduced MYC expression in xenograft
tumors. Interestingly, JQ1 resulted in elevated BRD4
protein expression in treated tumors. This observation
may indicate that an endogenous feed-back loop could
be initiated by BRD4 inhibition at least in some cellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

backgrounds. To avoid such feedback mechanisms, further
investigations about optimal dosing schedules for BET
inhibitors might be conducted. Our results give conclusive
evidence that BET inhibition via JQ1 is effective in
reducing medulloblastoma growth in a preclinical mouse
model for high-risk medulloblastoma.
Future clinical testing of BET inhibitors in highrisk medulloblastoma is clearly necessary to provide
the ultimate proof of the usefulness of this therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of this highly aggressive
pediatric malignancy. Investigating possible synergies
between BET inhibitors and other therapeutic agents
in clinical use for medulloblastoma treatment should,
therefore, be addressed in future studies. As mentioned
above, combining BET inhibition with targeted therapies
restoring TP53 expression, such as MDM2 inhibitors,
could provide one possibly synergistic option. Many
therapeutic strategies now used to treat medulloblastoma,
such as radiation, induce DNA damage in tumor cells.
DNA damage normally activates a signalling network
that blocks cell cycle progression, recruits DNA repair
factors or triggers senescence or apoptosis [35]. It is well
established that this DNA damage response is abrogated
in many malignancies in such a way that tumor cells
manage to maintain their proliferative capacity [36].
BRD4 was recently shown to insulate chromatin from
DNA damage signalling [37], indicating that combining
DNA-damaging agents with BET inhibitors, such as JQ1,
may increase DNA damage response in medulloblastoma
cells. Exploring such putative synergies in clinical
and preclinical investigations should fine-tune optimal
conditions for JQ1 administration.
Intensive research in the past years has revealed
BET bromodomain inhibition as a potent course of action
to inhibit MYC and induce antitumoral effects in different
malignancies [20-22, 27, 28]. Our observations explored
the feasibility of treating high-risk medulloblastoma
patients with JQ1 in preclinical models. The survival
advantage observed in mouse xenograft models of highrisk medulloblstoma suggests that JQ1 has the potential to
generate a measurable response in this patient subgroup,
which have dismal prognoses with current treatment
regimens, and thus, should be considered for entry into
clinical testing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
JQ1 treatment of cell lines in culture
The HD-MB3, ONS-76, DAOY and UW-228
human medulloblastoma cell lines were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, L-glutamine,
and antibiotics [38]. Medium for HD-MB3 was also
supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acid solution.

Cell cycle analysis

The human medulloblastoma cell lines, D-341 and D-283,
were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium
supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. The identity
of all cell lines was verified by STR genotyping performed
by the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). HD-MB3p53DN cells were generated by transfecting HD-MB3 with
pMSCV-puro-p53DD (Addgene, #K1062-1, Cambridge,
MA, USA), and selected for stable transfectants with 2 μg
puromycin/ mL full medium. Pure (+)-JQ1 sterioisomer
(BPS Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), which is referred
to as JQ1 throughout this paper, was aliquoted for single
use and stored at -20°C as stock solution (10 mM in
DMSO). Cells were exposed to 0–6 µM JQ1, prepared as
serial dilutions in full medium, for the periods indicated.
The final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration was
kept at or below 0.2%.

Medulloblastoma cell lines were seeded onto 96well plates (2 × 103 per well) in triplicate for all assays,
and incubated for 24h to permit surface adherence.
Viability was assessed in time course after treatment
with 1nM-6µM JQ1 for 24, 48, 72 and 96h using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The IC50 was
calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Apoptosis, proliferation and
senescence were assessed after identical time-course
treatment with 500 nM JQ1 using the Cell Death and
BrdU ELISAs (Roche) and the fluorometric SA-ß-gal
activity assay (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA),
respectively. All assays were performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. For cell cycle analysis,
cell lines were cultured 48h with 500 nM JQ1 or DMSO
control in 35mm plates at 5 x 107 cells/plates. Cells were
removed by trypsinization and washed 3 times with PBS,
then incubated with propidium iodide for 15 min to stain
DNA. Cellular DNA content was analyzed in an FC500
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). All experiments were
independently performed at least 3 times, if not otherwise
indicated.

Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using the
RNeasyMini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA
synthesis was performed using the SuperScript reverse
transcription kit (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany).
CAD, CCDN1 and MYC expression were monitored
using Assays-on-Demand™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster
city,CA, USA). Expression values were normalized to the
geometric mean of GAPDH [39]. Data analysis and error
propagation were performed using the qbasePLUS software
version 1.5 (http://www.biogazelle.com).

BRD4 knockdown and Xcelligence viability assay
To assess cellular survival after BRD4 knockdown,
we transfected HD-MB3 cells with siRNA against BRD4.
HD-MB3 cells were seeded at 5 x 104 on a 6-well plate
and incubated for 24h. HD-MB3 cells were transiently
transfected with either an siRNA directed against BRD4
(siBRD4 (1), Cat. No. s23901, and siBRD4 (2), Cat. No.
s23902, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) or the scrambled
control siRNA at a final concentration of 20 nmol using
the Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer`s protocol.
Mock control using only transfection reagent was also
performed. Protein and mRNA expression were analyzed
using western blotting and real-time RT-PCR, respectively,
as described above. Cell viability and cell death were
analyzed after 72h of transfection by MTT assay and
cell death ELISA as described above. Since siBRD4 (2)
showed the most effective BRD4 knockdown, we assessed
cellular survival after transfection with this siRNA in real
time using the Xcelligence system (Roche). HD-MB3
cells were plated in triplicate at 2 × 103 cells/well onto 96well Xcelligence microelectronic cell sensor plates, and
cultured overnight in antibiotic-free complete media. Cells
were transiently transfected with 20 nmol of either siBRD4
or control siRNA or mock transfected, then adherence to
the culture plates was continuously monitored for 190h to

Western blot analysis
Protein lysates were extracted from cells, separated
on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred as described in
Cimmino et al. [40]. Membranes were blocked 1h with
5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, then incubated with primary
antibodies in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T overnight or
up to 24h at 4°C. Primary antibodies against the following
proteins were used: MYC (1:1000, #9402, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), BRD4 (1:200, H-250, sc-48772,
Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), Cyclin D1 (1:200,
H-295, sc-753, Santa Cruz), E2F1 (1:200, AF4825, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MI, USA) and B-actin (1:2000,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as the loading
control. After washing twice with TBS-T, membranes
were incubated 1h at room temperature with secondary
antibodies diluted 1:2000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, USA) or HRP-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) were used as secondary
antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the ECLplus
western blotting detection kit (Amersham, Amersham,
UK) and analyzed on a FusionFX7 detection device
(Vilber Lourmat, Eberhartzell, Germany).

log2 expression was < 4 in at least 5 of the 6 samples, were
considered underexpressed and filtered out of the dataset.
Expression data from a total of 23376 probes remained
for analysis after filtering. Differential expression analysis
was performed using the Rank Product analysis package
v 2.13 in R [43]. Hierarchical clustering was performed
on the Manhattan distance of log2 expression values for
either all or the 100 most differentially expressed genes
to visualize differential gene expression in HD-MB3 cells
following JQ1 treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis
was performed using the GSEA v2.0 software from www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea [44]. Genes were ranked using a
signal:noise ranking metric (the difference of the means
of the populations compared scaled by the standard
deviation). The c2.cp.kegg.v3.1.symbols.gmt, c2.all.
v3.1.symbols.gmt and c5.all.v3.1.symbols.gmt (www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea) gene sets were used in this study.

Tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarrays were prepared from paraffinembedded tissue specimens from 115 primary
medulloblastomas and 14 cerebellum samples [32]. For
the array, 3 different tissue cores were taken from each
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor block using a
manual device (Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI,
USA), and 2µm sections were cut from the microarray for
immunohistochemical analyses. Sections from 2 additional
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human primary
medulloblastoma samples (2µm) and the formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded xenograft tumors (5µm) from JQ1treated and untreated nude mice were also analyzed
immunohistochemically. Immunohistochemical staining
was conducted as previously described [41]. In brief,
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
deparaffinized by routine techniques, and placed in 200
µL of target retrieval solution (pH, 6.0; Envision Plus
Detection Kit; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 20 min at
100°C. After cooling for 20 min, slides were quenched
with 3% H2O2 for 5min before incubating with primary
antibody using a Dako Autostainer (Dako Cytomation).
Primary antibodies against BRD4 (1:200, sc-48772,
Santa Cruz), cleaved caspase 3 (1:200, Cell Signaling)
and Ki67 (1:25, DAKO) were used. BRD4 expression
was evaluated by 2 independent researchers using a
semiquantitative scoring system on microarrays. In brief,
the number and intensity of positive cells were counted
and scored between 0 and 3 (0, no positive nuclei; 1,
1% - 20% nuclei display intense staining or more nuclei
display weak staining; 2, 20% – 80% intense staining or
more nuclei display moderate staining; 3, 80% – 100%
nuclei display intense staining). Samples with scores of
1 - 3 were considered as expressing the target protein.

Statistical analysis
We used the R2 visualization and analysis platform
(http://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi) to re-analyze
expression data from human primary medulloblastoma
microarrays (Künkele et al. 2012) and analyze expression
data from JQ1-treated and control HD-MB3 cells. SPSS,
version 18.0 (IBM SPSS) was used for further statistical
analysis. The student’s two-sided t-test was used to
compare all interval variables, and the chi-square test
was used for the comparison for all categorical variables.
Graph Pad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.) was used
to perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank
statistics on treated and untreated mouse cohorts.

JQ1 treatment of xenograft tumors in nude mice
HD-MB3 medulloblastoma cells were cultured
to 80% confluency, harvested and suspended in 200 µL
Matrigel™ (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) for
subcutaneous inoculation (2 × 107 cells per mouse, n=14
mice) into the left flank of 4-week-old female athymic
(nu/nu) mice. Mice were randomly assigned to either
JQ1 or vehicle control groups (n =7 mice per group) after
tumors reached 150 – 200 mm3 in size. We used a JQ1
treatment regimen previously been shown to be safe for
control mice and effective against different malignancies
in mouse models [21]. JQ1 or vehicle control was
administered daily by intraperitoneal injection at a dose
of 50mg/kg body weight. Tumor growth was monitored
using a caliper and tumor volume was calculated using
the formula (breadth × length × height)/2. Mice were
euthanized by cervical dislocation when tumor size
exceeded 1000mm3. In mice, whose xenograft tumors
were to be examined for MYC downregulation, 4 doses of
50 mg JQ1 per kg body weight were administered at 0, 12,
24 and 36 h over a 2-day course. Mice were euthanized by

Affymetrix microarray analysis
HD-MB3 cells plated at 5 x 104 cells/well in 6-well
plates, then after 12h for attachment, were treated in
triplicate with medium containing 0.2% DMSO (control)
or 500nM JQ1 for 24h. Total RNA was extracted using the
RNeasyMini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and used to
confirm at least a 50% decrease in MYC expression in the
JQ1-treated cells using real-time RT-PCR. Three replicas
were treated and analyzed. Samples were profiled using
the genechip Affymetrix Human Gene Expression Array
(HG-U133 Plus 2.0, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
at the Centre for Medical Biotechnology at the University
Hospital Essen using established protocols. Microarray
