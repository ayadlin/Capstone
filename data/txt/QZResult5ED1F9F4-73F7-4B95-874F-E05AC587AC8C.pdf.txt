Abstract
Recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer remains a devastating disease with insufficient treatment options. We investigated the MET receptor tyrosine kinase as a novel target for
the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). MET/phosphorylated MET and HGF expression was
analyzed in 121 tissues (HNSCC/normal) by immunohistochemistry, and in 20 HNSCC cell lines by immunoblotting. The
effects of MET inhibition using small interfering RNA/two
small-molecule inhibitors (SU11274/PF-2341066) on signaling,
migration, viability, and angiogenesis were determined. The
complete MET gene was sequenced in 66 head and neck cancer
tissue samples and eight cell lines. MET gene copy number was
determined in 14 cell lines and 23 tumor tissues. Drug
combinations of SU11274 with cisplatin or erlotinib were
tested in SCC35/HN5 cell lines. Eighty-four percent of the
HNSCC samples showed MET overexpression, whereas 18 of 20
HNSCC cell lines (90%) expressed MET. HGF overexpression
was present in 45% of HNSCC. MET inhibition with SU11274/
PF-2341066 abrogated MET signaling, cell viability, motility/
migration in vitro, and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Mutational
analysis of 66 tumor tissues and 8 cell lines identified novel
mutations in the semaphorin (T230M/E168D/N375S), juxtamembrane (T1010I/R988C), and tyrosine kinase (T1275I/
V1333I) domains (incidence: 13.5%). Increased MET gene copy
number was present with >10 copies in 3 of 23 (13%) tumor
tissues. A greater-than-additive inhibition of cell growth was
observed when combining a MET inhibitor with cisplatin or
erlotinib and synergy may be mediated via erbB3/AKT
signaling. MET is functionally important in HNSCC with
prominent overexpression, increased gene copy number, and
mutations. MET inhibition abrogated MET functions, including proliferation, migration/motility, and angiogenesis. MET is
a promising, novel target for HNSCC and combination
approaches with cisplatin or EGFR inhibitors should be
explored. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3021–31]

(47,560 cases in the United States; ref. 1). More than 90% of head
and neck cancers are of squamous histology (HNSCC). Thirty-five
percent to 45% of head and neck cancer patients ultimately die
from their disease. Little progress has been made in the treatment
for metastatic/recurrent HNC during the past two decades, with
the singular exception of cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antibody, which improves median survival by
2 months when added to standard chemotherapy (2). Overall
survival remains poor (median 6–10 months).
To improve HNSCC treatment, relevant molecular targets need
to be identified. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) seem to play a
pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HNC, with prior research
focusing on EGFR. Despite EGFR overexpression in >90% of
tumors, EGFR inhibition has only yielded low response rates of 4.3–
13% in clinical practice (3–4). Multiple lines of evidence indicate
that RTK pathway redundancies/cooperation are common in
RTK-driven malignancies and may account for resistance (5–8).
We studied the MET RTK and also explored EGFR/MET crosstalk
based on reports of cooperation in other diseases (6–9).
MET, located on chromosome 7q31, encodes several functional
domains, including the semaphorin (SEMA) domain (ligandbinding), juxtamembrane (JM) domain (regulatory), and the
receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) domain (10, 11). The sole ligand for
MET is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, scatter factor), which is
produced by stromal and sometimes tumor cells (10, 11). HGF
binding activates MET via intracellular phosphorylation initiating
RAS-RAF-ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mTOR signaling as well as several other pathways. In vivo, HGF/MET
signaling leads to increased cell growth, cell motility, invasion/
metastasis, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration
(10, 11). Studies show that HGF/MET signaling increases motility,
epithelial cell dispersion, endothelial cell migration, and chemotaxis. Furthermore, MET overexpression and activation has transforming properties for normal cells (10, 11).
MET is overexpressed in a number of solid tumors, and
expression correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor
prognosis (10, 11). Previously, we had shown that in lung cancer,
MET mutations can occur in the JM domain and the SEMA
domain, and not the TK domain (12). The precise function of most
mutations is not yet fully understood. MET mutations have been
described for HNC, especially in lymph node metastases (relative
frequency of up to 25% in some reports; ref. 13) and are located in
the TK domain similar to TK domain mutations found for renal cell
carcinomas (11), suggesting an important role for MET in HNC
(13). However, mutations in the SEMA and JM domains have not
been previously investigated for HNSCC. Further highlighting the

importance of MET is the observation of MET amplification in
several solid tumors, including subgroups of lung and gastric
cancers (6, 7, 14, 15).
In our study, we used a large cohort of HNC and normal mucosa
tissues as well as cell lines to identify prominent MET expression,
increased gene copy number, and mutations in the TK/JM/SEMA
domains. Furthermore, we show that MET inhibition alone and in
combination with cisplatin or an EGFR inhibitor is a promising
target for head and neck cancer.

Materials and Methods
Tumor tissue arrays/immunohistochemistry. Tissue microarrays of
97 HNC tissues and 24 normal mucosa samples were built (IRB: 8980).
Immunohistochemistry was performed for MET (C-12, 1:100), p-MET
(pY1003, Invitrogen, 1:25), HGF (H145, Santa Cruz, 1:50), human CD31
(JC70A, DAKO, 1:40), and Ki67 (RM-9106-S, NeoMarkers/Labvision, 1:300)
as previously described (12, 15, 16). Appropriate negative controls were
prepared. Immunohistochemistry results from tumor and adjacent normal
tissue were compared semiquantitatively by a senior pathologist (grading:
0 = negative, 1+ = low, 2+ = strong, 3+ = very strong expression; ref. 12).
Reagents and antibodies. Antibodies used for immunoblotting were
MET (3D4, Invitrogen/Zymed, C-12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylation site–specific MET pY1003, and pY1230/4/5 (Biosource/Invitrogen,
44-882G, 44-888G), h-actin/p16/ERCC1/Ron-a antibodies (H-196/JC-8/8F1/
H-170, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pTyr (4G10, Upstate/Millipore), and
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR; Cell Signaling; dilution 1:1,000)
as previously described (12, 15–17).
The following drugs were purchased: SU11274/IGF-IR inhibitor (Calbiochem), cisplatin (Sigma Aldrich), and erlotinib HCL (ACC). PF-2341066 was
kindly provided by Pfizer.
Cell lines and culture. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (SCC9/15/25/68/Cal27/Fadu), Dr. Ralph Weichselbaum
(Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL;
SQ20B, JSQ3, SCC35/61/294/151), Dr. Gary Clayman (M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, TX; 1483), the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
(London, United Kingdom; HN5), Dr. David Raben (University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, Aurora, CO; MSK921), and Dr. Mark Lingen
(Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; OSCC3,
SCC17B/28/58) and maintained in DMEM/F12 or RPMI medium and
penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini
Bioproducts). HaCaT is a spontaneously transformed human keratinocyte
cell line. HNX was derived from HN5 after prolonged subculture showing
suppressed EGFR and MET expression.
Immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblots were done using standard
methodology (12, 15–17).
MET small interfering RNA/small-molecule inhibitors. Cells were
grown in antibiotic-free medium to 60% confluency in 96-well (viability)/6well (immunoblotting) plates. MET small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used
at 100 Amol/L with Dharmafect transfection reagent (Dharmacon) using the
recommended protocol. Controls were treated with transfection agent only.
Cells were incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2 for 36 to 72 h before viability was
assessed or before lysate was harvested.
MET inhibition was achieved using small-molecule MET inhibitors
SU11274 (ACC; ref. 18) and PF-2341066 (Pfizer; ref. 19; Supplementary
Table S1).
Viability. Measurement was performed using Alamar blue (Resazurin,
Sigma-Aldrich) or MTT (R&D Systems). Soft-agar colony formation assays
were performed as previously described (15). Viability results were
evaluated by a fluorescence/absorbance 96-well plate reader Synergy HT
(BioTek). Synergy was calculated using Calcusyn as described by Chou and
colleagues (20).
Time-lapse video microscopy. Cells were plated on glass-bottomed
culture dishes (MatTek) in 10% FBS medium and grown for 24 h to achieve
20% to 30% confluency before drug treatment. Dishes were placed into a
temperature-controlled chamber at 37jC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

The cells were imaged on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope and
digitally captured with IPLab software (Scanalytics). Images at 100
magnification were saved every 5 min and processed as mpeg4 movies
(Sonic DVD). Cell movement/morphologic changes were processed with
ImageJ (NIH), Photoshop (Adobe), and MetaMorph (Universal Imaging
Corporation/Molecular Devices). The positions of the cell nuclei were
tracked, and distance/speed was calculated over 21 h.
Mutational analysis. Genomic DNA from 63 HNSCC tissues from
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was obtained from the University
of Chicago Head and Neck Cancer tissue bank (IRB: 8980). Genomic MET
reference sequences were obtained from position chr7:116,099,682–
116,225,676 from Ensembl (release 50; July 2008). Please note that the
MET transcript MET-001 (ENST00000318493) was used for identifying
genetic changes (e.g., R988C) and MET-002 (ENST00000397752) for
identifying phosphorylation sites (e.g., Y1230), which is consistent with
common practice (12, 16).
Real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR for gene copy number
measurement was done as previously described (15) using ABI StepOnePlus
(Applied Biosystems) and iQ-SYBR green (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Reactions
were done in triplicates under standard thermocycling conditions (one cycle
95jC  12 min, 45 cycles 95jC  20 s, 58jC  1 min). The mean threshold
cycle number was used.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis was done using two different BAC probes: RP11-433C10,
localized to 7p11.2 ( full-length EGFR gene), and RP11-163C9, localized to
7q31.2 (MET gene). Two-color FISH was done using RP11-144B2 (red)
together with RP11-163C9 (green). The procedure was done as previously
described (14), analyzing at least 10 metaphase cells.
Human papillomavirus testing. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing
was performed in cell lines evaluating for p16 expression (JC-8, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and by PCR using L1 PGMY09/11 primers (21), followed by
sequencing. HPV-positive results were confirmed using the Digene HPV test
(Qiagen).
In vivo Matrigel plug nude mouse xenograft modeling. Tumor cells
were mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected s.c. into the flanks
of nude mice (5  106 cells/flank) following Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee–approved protocols. The animals were monitored for 2 wk
and subsequently sacrificed. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin
embedded.
Statistical analyses. Data are expressed as mean F SE. Statistical
significance was tested with Graphpad Prism5. For comparison between
two groups, Student’s t test or the m2 test was used. For comparing between
>2 groups, one-way ANOVA was used. For evaluation of correlation,
Spearman’s test was used.

Results
MET/HGF are expressed in HNSCC tissues and cell lines.
MET immunohistochemistry was done on 121 cores (97 cancers/24
normal mucosa) as well as in phosphorylated MET (86 cancers/22
normal mucosa). Eighty-five percent (n = 84) of HNSCC tumors
overexpressed (2+/3+) MET and 66% (n = 57) overexpressed (2+/3+)
activated phosphorylated MET compared with adjacent normal
mucosa (Fig. 1A and B). Normal mucosa also expressed MET
(21% 1+, 21% 2+), albeit staining was weaker and primarily limited to
the basal layer of the mucosa (Fig. 1A; 23% 1+/2+ for phosphorylated
MET). No cases of 3+ expression were seen for normal mucosa. MET
localized primarily to the membrane and the cytoplasm.
Immunoblot analysis confirmed strong MET expression in 16 of
20 HNC cell lines [excluding HNX (derived from HN5) and HaCaT
(transformed keratinocytes)]; however, SCC17B and SCC151
expressed low levels of MET, which were outside the dynamic range
(Fig. 1C). SQ20B and SCC294 had low to moderate MET expression.
OSCC3, a HPV-positive cell line [p16+, PCR positive (HPV18), Digene
high-risk HPV positive], showed strong MET expression. EGFR,

The Role of MET in Head and Neck Cancer

Figure 1. A, analysis of the frequency
and localization of MET expression by
immunohistochemistry in HNSCC and
normal adjacent mucosa. MET was
strongly expressed (2+/3+) in 84% of
tumors. Normal mucosa had negative
or low MET expression in 79% (0/1+),
whereas 21% had 2+ staining (no 3+
staining). MET expression was
membranous and cytoplasmic.
B, phospho-MET epitope pY1003
immunohistochemistry: The staining
pattern closely resembled MET (A), with
strong expression in 71% of HNSCC
samples. C, MET was expressed in
18 of 20 HNSCC cell lines as seen by
immunoblotting, excluding HNX (derived
from HN5) and HaCaT (immortalized
keratinocytes). MET expression in
SCC17B/HN5 was very low (outside
the dynamic range). The 170-kDa
(glycosylated MET) and 140-kDa bands
(biologically active transmembrane h
subunit) are shown. RON expression
closely follows MET expression (12 of 15),
whereas expression of EGFR and IGF-IR
is nonconcordant. ERCC1 (nucleotide
excision repair pathway) is present in most
cell lines. OSCC3 was HPV18+. D, HGF
immunohistochemical staining in HNSCC
and normal adjacent mucosa. HGF was
expressed in 41% of tumors with 2+
expression in 21%. There was no
significant HGF expression in normal
mucosa.

IGF-IR, RON, and ERCC1 expression were prominent in several cell
lines. There was no statistical correlation with MET expression.
Analysis of MET gene expression using the publicly available
Oncomine database5 and data by Ginos and colleagues (22) showed
increased MET gene expression in 41 HNSCC compared with 13
normal controls (Supplementary Fig. S1).
HGF expression was evaluated in 68 HNC tumors by immunohistochemistry. The tumors showed strong (3+; 21%), moderate (2+;
24%), and weak (1+; 41%) HGF expression. Fifteen percent of the
tumors were HGF negative.
MET-specific small-molecule inhibitors or siRNAs inhibit
MET signaling. Using small-molecule MET inhibitors SU11274
( for cell lines, DMSO soluble, Figs. 2 and 3), PF-2341066 (water
soluble, clinical candidate, Fig. 4; see Supplementary Table S1), and
MET siRNA (Fig. 3B), MET activation/expression were suppressed.

whereas Fig. 2B shows results for phosphorylated MET and
downstream signaling effects in six HNSCC cell lines. Serum-

starved cells lines were pretreated with 0, 2, or 5 Amol/L of the
MET inhibitor SU11274 followed by treatment with HGF for
8 minutes. In cell lines SCC15, SCC28, and to a lesser degree SCC9
and SCC61, HGF stimulation led to a strong p-Tyr signal, which was
suppressed with SU11274 MET inhibitor treatment. SCC17B overall
had low p-Tyr expression, suggestive of either a less RTK-driven
phenotype (5) or a more ligand-dependent phenotype. Despite low
MET expression, external HGF stimulation and SU11274 pretreatment showed typical signaling effects of the HGF/MET axis.
Phosphorylated MET expression was weak at baseline in most
starved cells. Following HGF stimulation in all cell lines, a strong
phosphorylated MET response is observed that can be suppressed
in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A and B). Downstream signaling
for phosphorylated AKT was also increased with HGF and
decreased by MET inhibition in cell lines SCC15, SQ20B, SCC28,
and to a lesser degree in SCC61 (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylated ERK was
only mildly affected by MET inhibition with SU11274.
MET inhibition decreases viability in HNSCC. MET gene
silencing with MET-specific siRNA was used to validate effects of
MET inhibition in HNSCC. MET-specific siRNA duplexes were
transiently transfected into SCC61 and SQ20B cells (Fig. 3A), and

protein expression was decreased by >80% 72 hours after
transfection.
siRNA down-regulation of MET protein expression in SCC61 and
SQ20B cells resulted in inhibition of the serum-stimulated cell
growth and viability by >62%/55% as determined by MTS assays
(Fig. 3B).
We used SU11274 to test for its inhibitory effects on seven
HNSCC cell lines (Fig. 3C). MET inhibition was effective with IC50
values varying between 1 and 8 Amol/L: SCC61 (IC50 1 Amol/L),
SCC35 (IC50 3 Amol/L), and SCC9 (IC50 3.8 Amol/L) were the most
sensitive lines followed by HN31 (IC50 5 Amol/L) and MSK921/
SCC28 (IC50 5.4 Amol/L). SQ-20B, which has lower MET expression
and strong EGFR expression (EGFR amplification), showed an
elevated IC50 of 8 Amol/L (extrapolated from Fig. 3C). Generally, a
50% to 90% decrease in cell viability compared with control cells
was observed.
Furthermore, MET inhibition with SU11274 (3.5 Amol/L) led to
suppression of cell motility and migration. Figure 3D shows a
graphical depiction of distances covered by individual cells (SCC61)
over a period of 21 hours. SU11274-treated cells covered significantly
shorter distances (P = 0.0001) than untreated control cells. This
effect is consistent during the entire 21-h observation period.
MET inhibition in vivo. To study MET inhibition effects on
angiogenesis, water-soluble PF-2341066 was used in vivo (Supplementary Table S1). PF-2341066 inhibited HGF-dependent MET
phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations
of 10 to 100 nmol/L in HNC cell lines SCC61 and SCC35 in vitro
(Fig. 4A) and also in a soft-agar colony formation assay (OSCC3;
Fig. 4B); no large colonies formed. Comparable results in colony

formation assays were observed for SCC61 and SCC35 (data not
shown).
Effects on angiogenesis were investigated with an in vivo
Matrigel xenograft tumor model of OSCC3 and SCC35 treated
with PF-2341066 (25 mg/kg/d) versus control-treated cells (n = 3 in
each group). Figure 4 (C and D) shows abundant tumor growth in a
vehicle control–treated mouse, compared with minimal residual
tumor nests in the PF-2341066 group. Staining for the proliferation
marker Ki67 shows >80% to 90% suppression of proliferation in PF2341066–treated animals. Finally, staining of endothelial cells in
blood vessels with CD31 shows extensive tumor vessels between
tumor nests in control-treated animal versus marked angiogenesis
suppression in PF-2341066–treated animals, consistent with prior
reports using a related MET inhibitor in vivo (23).
SU11274 can synergize with erlotinib and cisplatin. Figure 5
shows four examples of dual treatment with MET inhibitor
SU11274 in combination with commonly used agents—cisplatin
or erlotinib.
SCC35 and SCC61, which required doses of >10 Amol/L to
approach IC50 toxicity (SCC35 >10 Amol/L cisplatin; SCC61
16 Amol/L cisplatin), were synergistically inhibited by combined
treatment with SU11274/cisplatin (SCC35 IC50 1.3/1.3 Amol/L,
and SCC61 IC50 1/2 Amol/L). Based on the median effect model by
Chou (20), the isobologram graph shows combinatorial index (CI)
values below 1 for the ED50 and ED75 (values <1 indicate synergy).
For combination with erlotinib, HN5 and SCC35 were chosen.
Cells were treated with either agent alone or with a combination of
both at equimolar doses. Both single agents showed efficacy,
decreasing viability. The combination, however, was consistently

Figure 3. A, in SCC61 and SQ20B, MET-specific siRNA (100 Amol/L) led to a significant decrease in MET protein expression, whereas control siRNA did not
suppress MET expression. B, SCC61 and SQ20B cells 72 h after transfection with MET-specific siRNA and control siRNA were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and showed significant decreases in viability compared with control ( 62%/55%). C, SU11274 treatment led to a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability compared with untreated control (DMSO solvent). In decreasing order of sensitivity (IC50), the following HNSCC cell lines responded to
increasing SU11274 concentrations: SCC61, SCC35, SCC9, HN31, MSK921, SCC28 and SQ20B. D, migration was significantly decreased after treatment with
SU11274 over a tracking period of 21 h. Colored lines, individual cell movement over 21 h. Cells treated with SU11274 moved significantly shorter distances
( 38%; P < 0.0001).

that at ED25 (CI = 0.73/035), ED50 (CI = 0.32/0.36), and ED75
(CI = 0.21/0.36), there was synergistic activity between erlotinib and
SU11274 (CI <1). Evaluation of downstream signaling in Fig. 5C
indicated that activation of erbB3 and subsequently AKT are
synergistically inhibited.
MET mutations in HNSCC tumor tissues and cell lines. The
entire MET coding region (schema in Supplementary Fig. S2) was
sequenced in 66 HNSCC and 8 cell lines. Three mutations in the
ligand-binding SEMA domain (T230M/E168D in the tumor tissue;
N375S in the SCC25 cell line) and two mutations in four tumor
samples in the transmembrane or JM domain (R988C, 3xT1010I;
Table 1A; Supplementary Fig. S2) were identified (previously
reported in other tumor types; refs. 12, 17). Furthermore, two
mutations in the TK domain (T1275I, V1333I) were identified,
which have not been described previously. No classic Y1230C/
Y1235D mutations were identified. All mutations were heterozygous. The rate of TK domain mutations was 3% (2 of 66) and the
rate of non-TK domain mutations was 9% (6 of 66). Overall,

MET gene copy number. We analyzed a panel of nine HNSCC
cell lines by FISH and followed this up with qPCR due to the ready
availability of DNA from HNSCC tumor tissues. Repetition of cell
lines previously analyzed by FISH now using qPCR was done
(Table 1B). FISH analysis showed three cell lines with >4 copies,
although qPCR copy number was lower (2.79 and 1.91). Generally,
qPCR showed similar or lower copy numbers compared with FISH
analysis. We subsequently analyzed 23 HNSCC tumor tissues from
patients by qPCR (Table 1C): 3 of 23 (13%) tumors showed gene
copy numbers of >10 with one sample showing a copy number of
22.1 and two samples 10.50/10.33 respectively. Furthermore, 15 of
23 (65%) HNSCC tumors showed copy numbers of 4 to 10. There
was no apparent correlation with smoking status or anatomic site,
although small sample numbers in subgroups do not allow for
proper assessment.

The Role of MET in Head and Neck Cancer

MET SNPs in HNSCC tumor tissues and cell lines. In addition
to mutations, multiple SNPs in the MET gene were identified as
heterozygous (A48A in 2, S178S in 4, Q648Q in 5, I706I in 1, K1250K
in 1, and D1304D/A1357A/P1382P occurred together in 22 samples)
and homozygous (Q648Q in 2, D1304D/A1357A/P13821P occurred
together in 9 samples; Table 1D).

Discussion
In this study, we show that MET is a novel target for HNSCC
showing prominent overexpression, mutations, and increased gene
copy number. We show the effectiveness of MET inhibition on cell
signaling, viability, migration, and angiogenesis. Our data provide a
strong rationale to use MET inhibition in translational and clinical
studies in HNC and suggest studying the integration with
established treatments.
MET is activated in HNSCC patient samples and the presence of
phosphorylated MET (66%) closely correlated with overall expression (79%): This is consistent with literature reports for HNC
(70–90% expression; refs. 24–29) and is comparable with NSCLC (12).
Our study helps to explain the prominent MET overexpression
demonstrating increased copy numbers in a subset of tumors.
Although karyotypic analysis is still considered the gold standard,
Bean and colleagues confirmed the usefulness of qPCR when
compared with array CGH analysis (7). Although no MET-amplified
HNC cell lines were identified, MET amplification has previously
been reported in gastric carcinoma (14) and NSCLC (6, 7) and
correlates with sensitivity to MET small-molecule inhibitors (6, 14).
This may be relevant for predicting HNC sensitivity to MET
inhibitors in future studies.

Gene array data was also consistent in showing overexpression
in HNC (Supplementary Fig. S1); furthermore, Ginos and
colleagues reported a link to an increased rate of locoregional
HNC recurrence (22).
Normal mucosa weakly expressed MET in the basal mucosa layer
(Fig. 1A), possibly linked to mucosa turnover/proliferation or field
cancerization. Reports by Chen and colleagues and Ohnishi and
colleagues suggest a role of MET in HNSCC dysplastic lesions
(24, 30).
The expression pattern was both cytoplasmic and membranous,
closely resembling data in lung cancer (31); the relative cellular
localization seems to be tissue specific and the functional
implications are still being elucidated (31).
Similar to prior reports, we confirm elevated HGF expression
in 59% of HNSCC [45% strong expression (2+/3+); 15% weak
expression (1+)] including the adjacent stroma, suggesting autocrine and/or paracrine signaling loops, which have been described
in other tumor types (gliomas, pancreatic and liver carcinomas;
refs. 31–34). This may be another possible predictor of response
and e.g. recent reports for the EGFR ligand amphiregulin suggest a
correlation with sensitivity to EGFR treatments (35).
The correlation MET/HGF expression/amplification status with
treatment outcomes is a high priority for future studies. Preclinically, Akervall and colleagues reported higher MET expression
based on gene array analysis in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines
compared with sensitive ones (36) and Aebersold and colleagues
reported that MET expression correlated with radioresistance
(37, 38). Several studies describe increased MET/HGF expression in
more invasive HNSCC (24, 25, 27, 39) as well as metastatic spread
(28, 29, 40). Finally, the role of epithelial to mesenchymal transition

Figure 5. A, HNSCC cell lines SCC35 and SCC61 were treated with cisplatin, SU11274, or combination at
indicated doses (ratio 1:1/1:2). Both single agents showed efficacy, decreasing viability between 40% and 70%.
The combination was consistently superior to either agent alone. The isobologram indicated synergy (CI <1).
B, HNSCC cell lines HN5 and SCC35 were treated with erlotinib, SU11274, or combination at equimolar doses. Both
single agents showed efficacy, but the combination was consistently superior to either agent alone. The isobolograms
indicate synergy (CI <1). C, immunoblotting of untreated and 4 h SU11274-, erlotinib-, and combination-treated
cells. Whereas both SU11274 and erlotinib suppress erbB3 and AKT phosphorylation, the combination achieves
increased suppression levels.

Tumor samples analyzed

NOTE: A. Table of MET mutations/variants. T1010I JM mutations have been reported to increase MET-related functions (signaling, tumorigenicity,
motility; ref. 12). Somatic MET TK domain mutations have been described in HNSCC as gain-of-function mutations (13). The schema of MET gene
depicting mutations is provided in Supplementary Fig. S2. Fourteen cell lines (B) and 23 HNSCC tumor tissues (C) were analyzed by FISH and/or qPCR.
Increased gene copy number was identified in three tumor samples with >10 copies and 15 tumor samples with 4 to 10 copies (qPCR). Comparison of
FISH and qPCR results showed reasonable correlation, with qPCR underestimating copy number. All tissue samples were analyzed by qPCR. D. In
addition to mutations, sequencing of 66 HNSCC tumor tissues identified eight SNPs. Three SNPs clustered together (indicated by *) and were present in
31 samples (47.0%). Other SNPs were repeated in seven, four, and two separate tumor samples.

has also been implicated with poor prognosis for HNSCC (41) and
MET is a known driver of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (11).
We report for the first time the identification of novel MET
alterations in the SEMA, JM, and TK domains in human HNSCC.
The precise function is part of ongoing studies (13, 17): Previously,
DiRenzo and colleagues and Aebersold and colleagues described
TK domain mutations in HNSCC in Y1230C and Y1235D in up to
10.9% of tumors (13, 38). In these studies, MET mutations primarily
occurred in lymph node metastases and could only be detected
with a higher sensitivity method (single-strand conformational
polymorphism). In a subsequent study, however, Morello and
colleagues did not identify any MET mutations in HNSCC (26). We
used standard PCR amplification and sequencing technology and
identified two novel TK domain mutations in one lymph node
metastasis and one primary tumor (T1275I and V1333I). We did not
detect Y1230C and Y1235D mutations. TK domain mutations are
reported to be somatic mutations in HNSCC and their functional
importance is well established in certain papillary renal cell
cancers (germline or somatic mutations; ref. 42). The functional
role of TK domain mutations in HNSCC remains to be determined
and high-sensitivity mutation screening/sequencing may be
required as seen for the EGFR T790M mutation in NSCLC (43).
We identify for the first time in HNSCC SEMA and JM domain
mutations/variants. Such mutations/variants have previously been
reported in lung cancer. The JM domain changes have been
implicated in increased motility and invasiveness in SCLC (12, 17)
and may have transforming properties (17). Preliminary reports
suggest that both SEMA and JM domain mutations/variants can
contribute to MET activation and may alter sensitivity to MET
inhibitors (44). In contrast to TK domain mutations, SEMA and JM
domain mutations/variants may be found in either germline DNA
or somatically.
MET inhibition can readily be achieved with small-molecule TK
inhibitors: PF-2341066 used here for in vivo studies is currently in
phase I clinical testing. SU11274 is a poorly water-soluble earlier

inhibitor developed by Sugen/Pfizer and clinical development was
not pursued.
Various parameters have been suggested as predictors of response
to MET kinase inhibitors (31), including strong expression as seen,
for example, in NSCLC (12), gene amplification as seen for gastric
carcinomas (14), and kinase domain mutations (45) and potentially
ligand expression as reported for amphiregulin/EGFR (46). Unlike
NSCLC and colon cancer, K-Ras mutations are not commonly
observed in HNSCC. Our data suggest that generally higher MET
expression levels correlate with increased sensitivity to MET
inhibition but are not sufficient to explain the remaining substantial
variation in IC50 values. Additional factors modulate responsiveness
and future studies may include correlation with increased gene copy
number, HGF expression, use of parallel RTK signaling cascades
(Fig. 1C), and potentially gene mutation status (e.g., PTEN).
AKT activation and ERK activation are oftentimes separate
events, with AKT being more prominently involved in cell survival
and ERK in proliferation (47). Although sometimes regulated
together (i.e., EGFR TK domain mutated NSCLC; ref. 47), it seems
that, for most, HNSCC regulation is separate (Fig. 2B). It is possible
that concurrent inhibition of the pathways leading to ERK
activation will increase therapeutic benefit.
Despite the lack of EGFR mutations in HNSCC in the United
States (48), most HNSCC are sensitive to EGFR inhibitors and
overexpression is abundant (4). Recent evidence in NSCLC suggests
a common signaling pathway via HER3/erbB3 (5–9). Specifically
Engelman and colleagues (6) implicated erbB3 signaling as the
mediator of amplified MET ‘‘overtaking’’ mutant-EGFR signaling in
a NSCLC in vitro model of acquired gefitinib resistance. On the
other hand, the recent study by Tang and colleagues (9) suggested a
central role for erbB3 in mediating the efficacy of dual MET/EGFR
inhibition against T790M-EGFR–mediated resistance in the
absence of prior EGFR TKI selection pressure. Our data for HNSCC
now also suggest a similar role of MET/erbB3 in the absence of
EGFR selection pressure.

Given the broad use of EGFR inhibition in HNSCC patients and
the limited single-agent response rate (3), ways to increase efficacy
with dual-kinase or multikinase inhibition are pivotal.
Gene copy numbers seemed to be higher in tumor tissue
samples compared with cell lines; most notably, we did not identify
any amplified cell lines. Although the reasons for this are unclear
(possible selection pressure, bias of cell line/tumor choice), such
tumors with higher gene copy numbers may be more sensitive to
MET inhibition.
Our data also suggest exploring MET inhibition in combination
with cisplatin. Interestingly, Akervall and colleagues when comparing cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines
by gene microarray techniques identified MET overexpression in
resistant lines (36). Henceforth, MET may be involved in mediating
cisplatin resistance or could be a general poor prognostic marker.
Further studies are indicated.
The proangiogenic properties of the MET/HGF axis are well
established and MET signaling can initiate vascular endothelial
growth factor production, a critical angiogenic switch via Shc (49).
We provide the first evidence of antiangiogenic effects of MET
inhibition in HNSCC in vivo using PF-2341066 in a Matrigel plug
model. A caveat is that murine HGF does not sufficiently activate
human MET (50); therefore, the use of a human HGF transgenic
model is of interest (50). Furthermore, in vivo metastasis modeling
of MET overexpression, mutations, and amplification for HNC will
provide additional insight into the role of MET for HNC metastasis.
Migration/motility is a surrogate metastasis marker, and we

provide the first evidence for HNSCC that MET suppression
abrogates a key component of the metastatic cascade.
In summary, we identified MET as a functionally important
receptor in HNSCC with activation and overexpression in tumor
tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, we describe evidence of
amplification and the presence of novel TK, SEMA, and JM domain
mutations. The consistent effects of MET inhibition validate this
target further and synergy with cisplatin and erlotinib is
therapeutically relevant. Further mechanistic studies into the role
of MET-mutated/amplified HNC are indicated and will allow us to
better use MET-specific drugs for selected patient groups.
