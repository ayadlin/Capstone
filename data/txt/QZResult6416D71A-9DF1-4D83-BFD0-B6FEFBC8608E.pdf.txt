Abstract
Netrins and their receptors deleted in colon cancer (DCC),
neogenin, UNC5, and integrins are involved in axon guidance,
epithelial morphogenesis, vascular pattering, cancer cell
survival, invasion, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis. Here,
we considered the possible contribution of the p53-related
apoptosis mediators p63 and p73 in the mechanisms
underlying the antagonism between netrin-1 and DCC at the
cell death control. We have showed that ectopic expression
and external addition of netrin-1 in HeLa and HEK-293 cells
with inactive p53 lead to impaired cell viability and induction
of apoptosis. These responses were associated with upregulation of the proapoptotic protein TAp73A, decreased
Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and caspase-3 cleavage, with no change in
protein levels of the antiapoptotic NH2-terminal–truncated
#Np73A isoform, p73 adapter Yap-1 and p73 E3 ubiquitin
ligase Itch, and p63, as well as the transcripts encoding
p63, TAp73A, and #Np73A. However, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 potentiated, while DCC counteracted, netrin1–induced TAp73A. Consistently, netrin-1 expression correlated with stabilization of the TAp73A protein and lower levels
of TAp73A ubiquitination that was conversely enhanced by
DCC, in a netrin-dependent manner. Our data indicate that
netrin-1 selectively up-regulates TAp73A by preventing its
ubiquitination and degradation. Targeted repression of p73A
by shRNA reversed TAp73A and the apoptosis induced by
netrin-1, and exacerbated the growth of HeLa tumor xenografts. Apoptosis induced by cisplatin was markedly enhanced
in netrin-1 or DCC-expressing cells. Collectively, our data
reveal that the transcriptionally active TAp73A tumor suppressor is implicated in the apoptosis induced by netrin-1 in a
p53-independent and DCC/ubiquitin-proteasome dependent
manner. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8231–9]

Introduction
Alterations in the molecular integrity and expression of deleted
in colorectal Cancer (DCC) and netrin-1 have been reported in
several human cancers. In a large fraction of colorectal cancers,

loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 18q, including the
DCC locus, has been described (1). Similarly, homozygous deletions
and point mutations have been detected in colorectal, testicular,
and pancreatic cancers. Netrin receptors DCC and UNC5 family are
down-regulated in over half of all colorectal cancers. In addition,
epigenetic inactivation of DCC and UNC5C genes has been
described after promoter hypermethylation and gene silencing,
suggesting that they function as putative tumor suppressor genes
in many tumor types, including human solid tumors and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (2–6). These genetic, epigenetic, and
molecular alterations are also found in brain, breast, urogenital,
and digestive cancers (7). The tumor suppressive functions of DCC
and UNC5H are linked to their ability to induce apoptosis when
they are not engaged with their ligands netrins (7, 8). The three
secreted netrins-1, netrin-3, and netrin-4 in mammals belong to a
conserved family of guidance clues related to the matricellular
protein laminin. The netrin signaling pathways are also initiated
through the transmembrane receptors neogenin and integrins, and
multiple downstream cascades using focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
src and Fyn tyrosine kinases, and the Rho-GTPases. Thus, netrins
signal via the simultaneous activation of several receptor subtypes
and signal transduction pathways involved in critical cellular and
molecular mechanisms linked to tumor progression, including
cancer cell survival, tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis
(9–14).
Despite intensive efforts to delineate the intracellular mechanisms of netrin signaling in normal and transformed cells, little is
known on the pathways underlying the antagonism between DCC
and netrin in cancer cell survival. Apoptosis induced by DCC is
dependent on caspase activation but independent of the intrinsic
mitochondrial and the extrinsic death receptor–mediated pathways (7, 14). However, the possible implication of the p53 family
members in the netrin-1 and DCC pathways on these mechanisms
has not been explored, until now. The p53 family members include
the p63 and 73 tumor suppressor proteins involved in cell cycle
regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcription of cell
proliferation and survival genes (15). In addition, structural
homologies, as well as molecular interactions and permissive or
antagonistic regulations between these wild-type (wt) and mutated
proteins are detected in several models (16–18). Similarly to p53,
p73 can promote growth arrest or apoptosis when overexpressed in
certain p53-null tumor cells. All p53 family members contain the
NH2-terminal transactivation (TA) domain for recruitment of core
transcriptional factors, a DNA-binding domain for recognition of
promoter sequences, and an oligomerization domain for tetramerization. Similarly to the TP63 gene, the TP73 encodes several
NH2- and COOH-terminal isoforms with opposing functions and is
rarely mutated in human tumors (15). These additional motifs

found in both p63 and 73, but not in p53, are created by a
combination of two alternative promoters, leading to the synthesis
of NH2-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and DNp73), and alternative
splicing variants at the COOH-terminal exons 10 to 14. TAp73a is
transactivation active and is proapoptotic, whereas DNp73a is not.
The COOH-terminal isoforms TAp73a are different according to
the sterile a motif (SAM) domain and the transcription inhibitory
domain (17, 19). The NH2 terminally truncated DNp73a proteins
interfere with the transactivation function of TAp73a and p53 in a
dominant-negative manner, inhibiting apoptosis (20, 21). Moreover,
DNp73a is up-regulated in several cancers and is therefore
associated with advanced pathologic states and poor prognosis
features in human colon and breast cancers and in patients
suffering from neuroblastoma (19, 22). Because the TP53 tumor
suppressor gene is frequently lost and invalidated by LOH and
mutational alterations in human solid tumors, we decided to focus
on the two p53 homologues p73 and p63, rarely mutated in cancer,
investigating their potential role in the netrin-1 and DCC antagonism on cell viability and apoptosis. For this purpose, we
examined the relationships between netrin-1, cancer cell survival,
and the p73 and p63 status in the p53-deficient HeLa and HEK-293
cell lines. Indeed, viral oncoproteins such adenovirus 5 E1B in

HEK-293 cells, human papillomavirus E6 in HeLa cells, as well as
SV40 large T, inactivate p53 by protein-protein interaction but do
not seem to interact with p73 (23).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture conditions, expression vectors, and transfections.
Human cervical and kidney cell lines HeLa and HEK-293 cells were
cultured at 37jC in DMEM without antibiotics (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories). Ectopic expression of netrin-1 and
DCC was achieved by transient transfection of HeLa and HEK-293 cells
(2.5  105) using either the pcDNA3.1-Netrin-1 vector encoding myc-tagged
chicken netrin, or the pCMV-DCC vector encoding the full-length human
DCC, and their combination, as described (14). The pcDNA3 vector
encoding E2F1 (24) was a generous gift from Dr. C. Prives, Columbia
University, New York, NY. Empty pcDNA3.1 vector was used to keep the
amount of DNA constant. Cells were transiently transfected for 6 h at 70%
to 90% confluency, using the plasmid DNA (up to 2 Ag) mixed with the
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at the DNA (Ag)/lipid (AL) ratio of
1:2.5. Transfected cells were then cultured in fresh medium for up to 24 to
48 h and harvested for transgene expression and other assays. Silencing of
p73 was performed with SureSilencing p73-shRNA plasmids (Super ArrayBioscience Corporation) containing 4 pooled shRNA sequences to ensure an
effective depletion of the six p73 isoforms in HeLa and HEK-293 cells. Each

either Netrin-1, DCC, and their combination (Net + DCC ), and compared with control vector–transfected cells, as described in Materials and Methods. A, cell viability
was evaluated by the MTT assay. Colorimetric evaluation was performed using a spectrophotometer at 570 nm. Data are expressed as the percentage of the
control values measured in sham-transfected cells (control vector). B, distribution of HeLa cells along the cell cycle phases was quantified by FACS analysis in
propidium iodide-stained cells after transient transfection of HeLa cells as indicated above. Data are expressed as the percentage of HeLa cells at the sub-G1 fraction
(apoptotic cells, top ) and those found at the other phases of the cell cycle (bottom ); C, cell apoptosis was determined in the same experimental conditions by
the TUNEL assay and FACS analysis to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells at the sub-G1 fraction. Data are means F SE of at least three separate
experiments. Significant differences versus control vector were as follows: *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.001 in A ; *, P < 0.05 in B; *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 in C ;

transfected with control vector and expression vector encoding Netrin-1. Both HeLa and HEK-293 cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection. Total cell lysates
were analyzed by immunoblotting using the corresponding antibodies. Endogenous h-actin protein levels was used as loading control. C, expression levels of the

for the scrambled control sequence (sh-CON). For stable transfection, HeLa
cells were selected for 2 wk in 1 mg/mL G418-containing medium. Two
control clones (sh-CON, clones 1 and 3) and two clones of p73-silenced
HeLa cells (shRNA-p73, clones 1 and 2) were then further selected and
characterized.
Semiquantitative and real-time quantitative reverse transcription
PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from HeLa and HEK293 cells using
the RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). For semiquantitative and qRT-PCR, total
RNA (2–2.5 Ag) was reverse transcribed using the Superscript III FirstStrand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The relative levels of the h-actin and p73a
isoforms transcripts were evaluated using a denaturation step at 95jC for
5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95jC for 30 s. Primers were as follows:
forward 5¶-ACCAGACAGCACCTACTTCG-3¶, reverse 5¶-TCGAAGGTGGAGCTGGGTTG-3¶ (TAp73a, amplicon: 252 bp); forward 5¶-AAGCGAAAATGCCAACAAAC-3¶, reverse 5¶-CACCGACGTACAGCATGGTA-3¶
(DN-p73a, 213 bp); forward 5¶-AACGTCACGCTCACACTGTC-3¶, reverse

from 2 Ag total RNA extracted from 2 independent experiments using the

netrin-1, DCC, and E2F1 expression vectors. The real-time PCR reactions
typically contained 1 AL of each gene-specific primer ( final concentration,
0.5 Amol/L), 10 mL SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (2; from Roche Applied
Biosystems), and 2 mL of the diluted cDNAs (1:10) in a total volume of
20 mL. Primers for qRT-PCR analysis were as follows: TAp73a, 106 bp:
forward 5¶ CCTCTGGAGCTCTCTGGAAC 3¶, reverse 5¶ GAAGACGTCCATGCTGGAAT 3¶; DNp73a, bp107: forward 5¶ CAGCCAGTTGACAGAACTAAGG 3¶, reverse 5¶ AGAGGCTCCGCAGCTAGTGA 3¶; and Actin, 90 bp:
forward 5¶ GGATGCAGAAGGAGATCACTG 3¶, reverse 5¶ CGATCCACACGGAGTACTTG 3¶. The quantitative PCR reactions were performed in
duplicate using a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR Systems (Roche Applied
Science). The thermal cycling conditions included an initial denaturation
step at 95jC for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95jC for 15 s, and 63jC for 1 min.
Western blot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially
as described (14). The blots were probed for 1 h at room temperature with
one of the after primary monoclonal (mAb) or polyclonal (pAb) antibodies:
the pAb directed against the SAM domain SAM of human p73a (1:2,000
dilution) and p63a (1:1,000) as described (25); the pAb directed against
phosphorylated p73a at Y-99 (1:1,000; Genescript Corporation); the pAbs
against h-actin (1:1,000), human p63a (1:500), DCC (1:500), Yap-1 (1:250),
and Bax (1:250) are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the mAbs against
cleaved caspase-3 (1:500) and chicken netrin-1 (1:250) are from Cell
Signaling and R&D Systems, respectively; the Itch pAb (1:500) and the mAbs
against Bcl-2 (1:500) were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Membranes
were reprobed for 1 h with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated

Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare), and quantified by
densitometric analysis, using ImageQuant software and digital scanning
(Agfa).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, apoptosis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses. HeLa and HEK293 cells (2  104 cells per well) transiently transfected for 24 h by the
control vector and the netrin-1 and DCC expression vectors were treated for
48 h with either 10 Amol/L cisplatin or 0.6 Amol/L doxorubicin. Then,
cultured cells were subjected to the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma). Cell cycle phase
distribution and apoptosis in sub-G1 fractions were analyzed by flow
cytometry of propidium iodide–labeled DNA content profiles, using a
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Labeling DNA breaks by the terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
assay was performed using the Apo-BrdUrd kit. All assays were performed
in triplicates for each condition. Results are presented as means F SE.
Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test.
TAp73A ubiquitination assays and stability. HEK-293 cells were
transiently cotransfected with expression vectors encoding TA-p73a (26)
and His6-c-Myc–tagged human ubiquitin (27), in the presence of the control,
netrin-1, and DCC expression vectors. Transfected cells were cultured for
32 h in standard culture conditions, and then treated for 8 h with the
proteasome inhibitor MG132 before harvesting (10 Amol/L; Stressgen). Cell
extracts were prepared in NP40 lysis buffer and Myc-ubiquitin–conjugated
proteins were separated by overnight incubation at 4jC, using Ni-NTAagarose beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed thrice with the NP40 lysis
buffer, and the nickel-binding proteins were resuspended in 1 Laemmli

sample buffer, denatured for 5 min at 95jC, and loaded onto 10%
polyacrylamide-SDS gels before being subjected to Western blotting with
the p73a anti-SAM domain pAb (25). For the determination of TA-73a
protein stability, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected for 24 h with a 1:5 ratio
for the TAp73a/pcDNA3 and TAp73a/Netrin-1 plasmids (3 Ag total DNA).
Cells were then treated with 50 Ag/mL cycloheximide (Sigma), and whole
cell lysates were processed at the indicated time points for immunoblot
analysis. The relative amount of TA-p73a protein was evaluated by
densitometry and normalized to h-actin signals.

Results
Netrin-1 affects cell death and survival. To examine the role of
netrin-1 on cell viability and cell cycle progression, we transfected
p53-deficient HeLa cancer cells with expression vectors encoding
either netrin-1, wt-DCC, and their combination. We noted that
netrin-1 or DCC expression reduced HeLa cell viability by 30%
(Fig. 1A). This cellular response was attenuated by ectopic
expression of both DCC and netrin-1, as expected. Our results
suggested that netrin-1 reduces cancer cell survival while counteracting the established proapoptotic functions of the DCC tumor
suppressor. To further document this observation, we next
examined the role of netrin-1 on cell cycle progression and
apoptosis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
Both netrin-1 and DCC induced, respectively, a 2.6- and 2.2-fold
increase of the apoptotic cell fraction in cultured HeLa cells
(sub-G1 fraction) without any change in the distribution of HeLa

treated with MG132 (10 Amol/L) for 8 h. Cell lysates were then prepared, and total proteins were analyzed by direct Western blotting, using the same antibodies.
Bottom, the ubiquitinated proteins were recovered from total cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with Ni-NTA-agarose beads, followed by immunoblotting with the

TA-p73a ubiquitination signals corresponding to the full-length and cleaved forms of TAp73a bands normalized according to the TAp73a protein detected by direct
Western blot. Data are representative of another experiment. B, HEK-293 cells were transfected with TAp73a alone or together with Netrin-1 or control vectors.
Top, at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with 50 Ag/mL cycloheximide and harvested at the time points shown for TAp73a and h-actin immunoblot analysis.

cells at the successive transitions of the cell cycle (Fig. 1B). As
observed in the MTT assay, simultaneous expression of both
netrin-1 and DCC neutralized their respective deleterious functions
on HeLa cell apoptosis. We subsequently confirmed these data
using the TUNEL assay showing that netrin-1 increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells 4-fold, DCC 6-fold, and their
combination, only 2-fold (Fig. 1C).
Induction of TAp73A protein by netrin-1 expression. We
next evaluated whether the p53-related proteins p73a and p63 were
involved in the apoptosis induced by netrin-1 in the p53-deficient
cell lines HeLa and HEK-293. First, we investigated the effect of
netrin-1 ectopic expression on the accumulation of their transcripts and protein isoforms. As shown in Fig. 2A, netrin-1
selectively induced a robust accumulation of the TAp73a protein in
HeLa cells (73 KD; 2.6 F 0.06-fold increase; n = 3), without any
significant change in the transcript levels of TAp73a and DNp73a
(Fig. 2C) by semiquantitative (left) and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; right). Our data indicate that netrin-1 is acting
on TAp73a expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms.
Consistently, ectopic netrin-1 failed to up-regulate DNp73a and
p63a proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). In keeping with our data on
cell survival and apoptosis in HeLa cells (Fig. 1), netrin-1 downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (5.3-fold) and upregulated the proapoptotic protein Bax (1.4-fold) in HEK-293 cells
(Fig. 2A), resulting in a decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, an index of the

apoptosis signature. This conclusion was further validated by the
detection of the cleaved caspase-3 protein in netrin-1–transfected
HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the induction of the TAp73a
protein by netrin-1 was confirmed and extended in the p53deficient HEK-293 cell line (3 F 0.7-fold increase; n = 4
experiments).
Implication of TAp73A in the apoptosis induced by netrin-1.
We sought to determine whether TAp73a expression was essential
in the netrin-1 apoptotic function. Expression of the TAp73a
isoform was inhibited by transient transfection of HeLa cells by
shRNA, and its reduced protein expression was tested by
immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, the p73 shRNA
reduced by 29% and 70% endogenous and netrin-1–induced
TAp73a levels in HeLa cells, respectively (n = 3 experiments),
whereas the control scrambled RNA vector had no interference on
the induction of TAp73a by netrin-1 in sh-CON cells (5.5 F 0.6fold increase). Results obtained in HeLa cells were confirmed in
HEK-293 cells transfected by the netrin-1 vector in the presence
and absence of the p73 shRNAs versus the scrambled sequences
(data not shown). Most importantly, the p73 shRNAs reversed the
induction of the p73a protein by netrin-1 to control levels
(scrambled) and was able to reduce by 65% F 3.3% the netrin1–dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Our data imply
that netrin-1 mediates apoptosis through induction of the TAp73a
proapoptotic form.

Role of the netrin-1 receptor DCC in the induction of
TAp73A by netrin-1. We next examined the molecular status of
the DCC tumor suppressor gene in HeLa cells. Using combined
PCR and sequencing methods to amplify and characterize the
molecular integrity of the DCC gene in this model, we detected an
internal deletion of six bp within exon 26, leading to the RTV
sequence in HeLa cells instead of RSQV in the wt-DCC protein
sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1). Such a molecular alteration in
the DCC gene has been previously reported in the IMR-32
neuroblastoma cell line (28). Taking into account the DCC
molecular status in our model, we next explored the effect of wtDCC on p73a protein levels after transient transfection of HeLa
cells for 24 and 48 hours with the netrin-1 and DCC expression
vectors. As shown in Fig. 3B, reconstitution with wt-DCC in HeLa
cells failed to elevate endogenous p73a levels but instead decreased
by 15% and 32% the p73a levels induced by netrin-1 at the 24- and
48-hour time points. Of note, loss of the DCC signal observed at
48 hours in the presence of netrin-1 is associated with amplification
of the TAp73a signal. As expected, simultaneous expression of
netrin-1 with wt-DCC decreased and abolished DCC levels in HeLa
cells at 24 and 48 hours, respectively, in agreement with previous
reports showing that DCC is subjected to ubiquitin-dependent
degradation after interaction with its ligand, netrin-1 (29). Consistently, the stability of the ectopic wt-DCC protein was greatly
enhanced by MG132 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, endogenous
DCC was not detected in the presence and absence of this
proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that the resident DCC protein is
either (a) expressed at very low levels, (b) is expressed under a
mutated/truncated form, as shown in HeLa cells, or (c) is not
expressed at all, due to other mutations or truncations in coding/
noncoding regions of the DCC gene. Because introduction of wt-DCC
in HeLa and HEK-293 cells induced apoptosis, one can postulate
that endogenous DCC is not functioning as a dominant-negative
form of the transfected wt-DCC form. It is therefore likely that
the endogenous DCC pathway is inactivated in these two models.
Implication of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the
induction of p73A by netrin-1. Because p73a stability is
regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (30), we next
examined whether the proteasome inhibitor MG132 affected
TAp73a induced by netrin-1 in the presence and absence of
wt-DCC. As shown in Fig. 3C, MG132 strongly potentiated
TAp73a levels induced by netrin-1 in the presence and absence
of the wt-DCC vector. In contrast, wt-DCC was ineffective in the
induction of the TAp73a protein in HeLa cells incubated in the
presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor. DCC decreased
netrin-1–induced TAp73a levels under both conditions, in spite of
the depletion of wt-DCC protein induced by netrin-1. We found
that netrin-1 had no effect on the expression levels of the p73
ubiquitin ligase Itch and p73 modular adapter protein Yap-1 in
HeLa cells (data not shown). Both Yap-1 and Itch bind the same
PPPY motif of p73, resulting in stabilization of p73 by Yap-1 and
prevention of Itch-mediated ubiquitination of p73 (31). Our data
favor the hypothesis that netrin-1 targets the activation status of
p73 ubiquitin/deubiquitin ligases.
We therefore sought to determine the effect of netrin-1 and DCC
on the ubiquitination levels of p73a after cotransfection of HEK-293
cells with expression vectors encoding His6-c-Myc–tagged human
ubiquitin, h-galactosidase, and TAp73a (Fig. 4A). Quantification of
TAp73a ubiquitination (bottom) was performed by densitometry
analysis of the wt-TAp73a protein (arrow) and its cleaved forms,
both normalized to the relative amounts of total TAp73a detected

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

by direct Western blot (top). In two separate experiments, we
observed that netrin-1 reduced by 62% and 63% the ubiquitination
levels of the full-length and cleaved forms of the TAp73a protein in
HEK-293 cells. Conversely, wt-DCC increased by 15% and 61% the
ubiquitination levels of the cleaved and wt forms of TAp73a,
respectively. Upon cotransfection with netrin-1 + DCC, these two
ubiquinated bands were respectively reduced by 61% and 22%.
We next examined the turnover of TAp73a in the presence and
absence of ectopically expressed Netrin-1 (Fig. 4B). Twenty four
hours posttranfection of HEK-293 cells with TAp73a and Netrin-1 or
control vectors, these cells were treated with the translation
inhibitor cycloheximide for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours. TAp73a protein
levels were monitored by Western blot and normalized to h-actin.
As shown in Fig. 4B, netrin-1 clearly stabilizes TAp73a protein
levels leading to a significant increase in protein half-life.
Netrin-1 and DCC selectively potentiate alterations of cell
viability induced by cisplatin. Given that TAp73a is recognized
as an important mediator of the apoptosis induced by cisplatin, we
next tested whether netrin-1 and DCC interfere with alterations of
HeLa cell viability induced by cisplatin and doxorubicin, two
chemotherapeutic drugs with different modes of action. As a
topoisomerase type II inhibitor and intercalating agent, the
anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin induces breaks in the genomic
DNA and blocks DNA synthesis and transcription. The cytotoxicity
of the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin is achieved in part through
inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, and induction of
the DNA damage response signaling pathways involved in the
transduction of genotoxic stress signals to the p53 and p73

Figure 5. Netrin-1 and DCC cooperate with cisplatin-induced alterations

concentrations of cisplatin (left) or doxorubicin (Dox ; right ). The inhibitory
potency (IC50) of each drug was measured according to the concentration giving
half-maximal inhibition of cell viability, using the MTT test; bottom, HeLa cells
were transfected with control vector alone (vector ) and expression vectors
encoding either Netrin-1, wt-DCC, or their combination (Net + DCC ), as
indicated. At 24 h posttransfection, nontransfected cells (control) and transiently
transfected cells were treated for 48 h with the IC50 drug concentrations
(cisplatin, 10 Amol/L; doxorubicin, 0.6 Amol/L), and cell viability was determined
by MTT assay. Data are expressed as the percentage of the initial cell viability
measured in nontransfected control cells, resulting in f50% to 60% residual
viability measured in the presence of each anticancer drug tested at their

Figure 6. Impact of stable expression of p73 shRNAs and Netrin-1 on HeLa cell viability, invasion, and tumorigenicity. A, validation of p73a stable silencing by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis in HeLa cells stably transfected with the sh-CON (clones 1 and 3) or shRNA-p73 constructs (clones 1 and 2 ). Top, the sh-CON

(+) or absence of Netrin-1 in the presence of MG132 ( ). B, effect of stable expression of shRNAs targeting p73 on collagen type I gel invasion and growth of
HeLa tumor cell xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Top, collagen type I invasion assays were done as described (14) using stable transfectants of HeLa cells
expressing p73 interferring shRNAs (shRNA-p73 ) or their control counterparts (sh-CON scrambled sequences). Invasive and superficial HeLa sh-CON and
shRNA-p73a–silenced cells adherent to collagen type I gels were counted in 12 fields of 0.157 mm2 using an inverted microscope, representing a total of 250 to
300 cells examined and screened for each experimental condition. Invading cells were scored as described in the Materials and Methods section. Netrin-1 was
ineffective to further increase the spontaneous invasive phenotype observed in sh-CON and shRNA-p73 HeLa cells (data not shown). Columns, mean from three
independent experiments; bars, SE. Bottom, xenografts were induced by s.c. injections of 4  106 cells (HeLa sh-CON, clone 1 ; shRNA-p73, clone 1) in female severe
combined immunodeficient CB17 mice, 6 mice (6- to 8-wk-old, 6 mice per group). Tumor dimensions were measured every week, and the volume (V , mm3)
calculated as V = (L 2  W )/6, L and W being the length and width of the tumor xenografts. All experiments were conducted in agreement with the guidelines of
the Animal Care Committee. The growth of the HeLa-induced tumors was exacerbated by p73 silencing (*, P < 0.05). C, cell viability evaluated by the MTT assay in
HeLa sh-CON (clone 1) and shRNA-p73 cells (clone 1 ) challenged for 48 h with cisplatin (10 Amol/L), Netrin-1, and their combination. Netrin-1 treatment (100 ng/mL)
was repeated every 12 h. Data are from three separate experiments and are expressed as the percentage of the respective control values. Similar data are
observed with the HeLa sh-CON clone 3 and the shRNA-p73 clone 2. Significant differences (*, P < 0.01) versus control conditions.

regulators of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. First, we established
the inhibitory potency of cisplatin and doxorubicin in control
HeLa cells (Fig. 5, top). We observed that 10 Amol/L cisplatin and
0.6 Amol/L doxorubicin induced a reduction of f50% in HeLa cell
viability. Both netrin-1 and DCC ectopic expression increased the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin (Fig. 5, bottom), compared with control
vector-transfected cells (P < 0.001). It is noteworthy that when
HeLa cells were transfected with the same netrin-1 and DCCencoding vectors, we observed no change in cell viability over the
doxorubicin-only treatment.
Effect of external addition of the netrin-1 peptide on
TAp73A levels and HeLa cell viability. Further proof of the role
of netrin-1 on TAp73a expression and cell viability was provided
from HeLa cells stably transfected by expression vectors encoding
either p73 silencing shRNAs (sh-RNA-p73) or control sh-scrambled
sequences (sh-CON). The effect of external addition of the netrin-1
peptide was investigated on TAp73a protein and the MTT test. As
shown in Fig. 6A, the robust induction of p73a protein levels by
cisplatin, observed in the sh-CON HeLa cells, was alleviated by the
p73 shRNAs, as expected from the validation of the silenced versus
the scrambled control clones. In agreement, p73a silencing
exacerbates the growth of HeLa tumor xenografts in nude mice,

www.aacrjournals.org

with no effect on the invasive potential of HeLa cells in collagen
type I gels (Fig. 6B) and in subcutaneous tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). In both groups, f75% of tumor xenografts were found
invasive. The percentage of Ki-67–positive tumors in p73-silenced
cells (26.8%) was significantly higher than the percentage in the
corresponding control xenografts (7.6%; P < 0.01), whereas the
number of TUNEL-positive cells was higher in control versus p73silenced cells (respectively, 22.4% and 3.1%; P < 0.01). Consistently,
stable silencing of p73a resulted in remarkable induction of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in sh-RNA-p73 HeLa cells (data not
shown). Taken together, our data support the functional validation
of the p73a-silenced HeLa cells in the context of cancer cell
proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. As shown in Fig. 6C,
the netrin-1 peptide and cisplatin induced a robust accumulation
of TAp73a and compromised HeLa cell viability to similar extent in
sh-CON HeLa cells but not in silenced p73-shRNA cells.

Cancer Research

has been largely documented in the literature. In the present study,
we bring original data on the conditional regulation of apoptosis
induced by netrin-1 and DCC in p53-deficient HeLa and HEK-293
cells. The pertinence of these two models for our study and
objectives is validated by the observation that the TP53 tumor
suppressor gene is commonly lost or mutated in human solid
tumors. Deficiency of p53 disrupts anticancer drug–induced
apoptosis and promotes resistance to chemotherapy and a more
malignant phenotype. In contrast, the p73 and p63 proteins are
rarely mutated in human tumors and are mainly regulated via
complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.
Because extensive crosstalk among the p53 family members and
their isoforms has been reported, our approach therefore facilitates
the interpretation of our data under a relevant context of
carcinogenesis.
We showed that netrin-1 exerts two divergent functions on cell
survival by inducing apoptosis in the absence of DCC, and blocking
the apoptosis induced by the DCC tumor suppressor protein,
according to the dependence receptor hypothesis. Our data
indicate that the cell death pathways induced by netrin-1 and
DCC are mutually exclusive. Netrin-1 induced convergent deleterious signals against cancer cell viability and survival as evidenced
by the MTT test and determination of apoptosis in the sub-G1
fraction by FACS analysis and TUNEL assay. Netrin-1 induced
caspase-3 cleavage and decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, underlying
its capacity to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial
pathway. Phenotypic effects of netrin-1 on viability and apoptosis
were associated with the selective induction of the long TAp73a
protein isoform in HeLa and HEK-293 cells, suggesting that netrin1 is a potential regulator of apoptosis and gene expression via
TAp73a. Indeed, the TAp73a isoform exhibits proapoptotic
functions and transactivates several p53 target genes involved in
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In our study, however, the induction
of TAp73a protein by netrin-1 did not correlate with any change in
the distribution of HeLa cells within the different phases of the cell
cycle, suggesting a selective effect of netrin-1 on survival in cancer
cells with compromised p53. In addition, no induction of the
DNp73a short isoform was seen by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting
in netrin-1–expressing cells. The DNp73a short isoform is
associated with cell survival, and functions as a dominant negative
competitor of TAp73a, due to inhibitory hetero-oligomer formation
(32). Consistently, the DN isoforms of p73 and p63 are frequently
overexpressed in cancer. However, no effect on p63 protein levels
was detected after netrin-1 expression, thus showing selective
netrin-1 regulation at the p73 signaling network. This observation
is compatible with the notion that p63 regulates progenitor cell
populations and morphogenesis at the proliferation-differentiation
interface in the epithelial and mesenchymal cell lineages, as shown
in p63 loss-of-function mouse models (33). Knockdown of p63
expression by shRNA in mammary epithelial cells caused both cell
detachment and anoı̈kis associated with down-regulation of cell
adhesion-associated genes encoding h1, h4, and a6 integrins, as
well as laminin-g2 and fibronectin (34). Interestingly, both a6h4
and a3h1 integrins are now considered as functional netrin-1
receptors (35).
In this report, we have shown that netrin-1 selectively upregulates TAp73a levels through posttranscriptional mechanisms,
including inhibition of p73a ubiquitination, stabilization of the
p73a protein, with no change in the expression levels of the p73a
ubiquitination effectors Itch and Yap-1 (31, 36). In agreement, the
induction of the TAp73a protein levels by netrin-1 synergizes with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Of note, netrin-1 was ineffective
on the Tyr-99 phosphorylation levels of TAp73a targeted by the abl
tyrosine kinase (data not shown), and involved in the stability of
p73. Implication of cyclin-Cdk complexes, acetylation-dependent
mechanisms, and ubiquitin-independent pathways using the 20S
proteasome were also reported for regulating p73 stability and
degradation (37–39). Another possibility is that netrin-1 regulates
the translation of the p73a mRNA as recently illustrated by the
elegant study of Tsai showing that netrin-1 alleviated the Grb7mediated translational repression of the n opioid receptor mRNA
via a netrin-1/integrin/FAK and Grb-7 pathway (40). Other key
signaling molecules involved in cancer cell survival and progression, including DCC and src, are potentially involved in this FAK
molecular scaffold (41). Consistent with this hypothesis, our data
indicate that the cell death factor DCC is not competent to induce
TAp73a protein levels but conversely counteracts netrin-induced
TAp73a protein accumulation. Another divergent mechanism
underlying the apoptosis induced by netrin-1 and DCC is
illustrated by the observation that DCC is highly efficient in
TAp73a ubiquitination. Additional mechanisms may include the
participation of microRNAs in regulating apoptosis sensitivity to
netrin-1, DCC, and TAp73a (42).
The implication of the TAp73a signal on the apoptosis induced
by netrin-1 was shown by transient and stable silencing the
endogenous p73a protein levels. Our data therefore indicate that
TAp73a is a relevant mediator of the apoptosis induced by netrin-1.
Identification of the netrin signaling effectors and target genes
induced via TAp73a should provide more information on the
signaling networks involved in the apoptosis induced by netrin-1.
This question is sustained by the positive cooperativity we have
observed between netrin-1/DCC on the cisplatin cytotoxicity in
HeLa cells. Recent advances in the field indicate that TAp73a
increases the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and oxidative
stress and is involved in the limitation of anchorage-independent
growth (43).
In the present study, we found that netrin-1 induced apoptosis in
DCC-deficient HeLa cells. Emerging evidence underline the
molecular and functional diversity of the netrin ligands, receptors
and coreceptors (DCC-adenosine A2B, UNC5A to 5D, neogenin,
integrins/FAK, as well as unidentified netrin-1 receptors), and their
interplay or antagonism regarding angiogenesis, apoptosis, and
survival in cancer cells (35, 44–46). Another level of complexity is
illustrated by the formation of homodimers and heterodimers
between the cell death family netrin receptors, as shown during
axon attraction and repulsion (47). We have shown that DCCdeficient human colon cancer cells and tumors retain UNC5 netrin
receptors A to B and C (14). In contrast, expression of the netrin-1
gene NTN1 is reduced or absent in brain and prostate cancers
(48, 49), suggesting that cell death signals induced by netrin-1 can be
abrogated during oncogenesis. Divergent biological roles of netrin-1
in attraction, retraction or repulsion of neuronal, endothelial, and
epithelial cells are also reported according to the cellular and
signaling context (12, 46, 50). Therefore, different known or unknown
netrin receptors can be sequentially and reciprocally activated,
desensitized/internalized, or degraded. Recent data indicate that the
dependence receptors UNC5A regulate naturally occurring apoptosis
independently of netrin-1 and, therefore, do not provide support for
the dependence ligand hypothesis (45). Netrins are secreted and
diffusible molecules that are stored together with several growth
factors and matricellular proteins at the vicinity of cancer cells and
tumor stromal cells. These paracrine and autocrine factors have
