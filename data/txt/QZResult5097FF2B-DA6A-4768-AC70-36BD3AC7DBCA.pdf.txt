Abstract
Tumor relapse and metastasis are the primary causes of poor survival rates
in patients with advanced cancer despite successful resection or chemotherapeutic
treatment. A primary cause of relapse and metastasis is the persistence of cancer
stem cells (CSCs), which are highly resistant to chemotherapy. Although highly
efficacious drugs suppressing several subpopulations of CSCs in various tissue-specific
cancers are available, recurrence is still common in patients. To find more suitable
therapy for relapse, the mechanisms underlying metastasis and drug-resistance
associated with relapse-initiating CSCs need to be identified. Recent studies in
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of some cancer patients manifest phenotypes of both
CSCs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These patients are unresponsive
to standard chemotherapies and have low progression free survival, suggesting that
EMT-positive CTCs are related to co-occur with or transform into relapse-initiating
CSCs. Furthermore, EMT programming in cancer cells enables in the remodeling
of extracellular matrix to break the dormancy of relapse-initiating CSCs. In this
review, we extensively discuss the association of the EMT program with CTCs and
CSCs to characterize a subpopulation of patients prone to relapses. Identifying the
mechanisms by which EMT-transformed CTCs and CSCs initiate relapse could facilitate
the development of new or enhanced personalized therapeutic regimens.

Introduction

primary tumor (local, regional or distant) is influenced
predominantly by microenvironmental factors that
provide an adaptive landscape for relapsed tumor cells.
The adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix
(ECM) drives the activation of certain signature genes that
promote cancer progression or tissue-dependent dormancy
[4, 5]. Thus, identifying these genetic alterations could
reveal new avenues for preventing or treating tumor
relapse and could improve the long-term survival of
patients. As shown in Table 1, survival rate is associated
with tumor recurrence in various types of cancer.
A major cause of tumor relapse is an increasing
number of CTCs and their downstream transformation
into CSCs which initiate recurrence [6-9]. Notably, cases
demonstrating chemo- or radio-resistance have high
numbers of EMT transformed CTCs [10, 11]. Evidence
from clinical studies suggests that poor survival of
cancer patients has been linked with EMT phenotypes in
malignant cancer cells [12-14].

Despite initially successful multimodal therapy
that includes resection, chemotherapy and for some
cases radiation therapy, tumor recurrence remains a
major etiology of the morbidity and mortality in cancer
patients. A systematic review of acquired relapse in cancer
patients suggested that tumor cells undergo dynamic
clonal evolution under the strong selective pressure of
chemotherapy, radiation therapy and any other therapeutic
intervention [1, 2]. These treatment-resistant clones of
neoplastic cells show somatic mutations and phenotypic
variations not present in their state of origin. Over the past
decade, these subpopulations have been isolated using
novel surface markers of CSCs to dissect the causes of
inter- and intra- tumors heterogeneity [3]. The source of
this subset of treatment-resistant, relapse-initiating and the
dynamic evolution of these clones must be understood.

Accumulating evidence shows that a subset of
CTCs and CSCs have an EMT phenotype [15-19].
Another notable finding demonstrates that a subclone
of CTCs can be induced to express phenotypes of CSCs
[18, 20-23]. These discoveries suggest that EMT links
CTCs and CSCs, enabling these cells to survive in the
peripheral circulation and actively causing relapse. A
better understanding of the etiology of the reprogramming
switches that determine the progression through EMT,
CTCs, dormancy and CSCs could pave the way towards
clinically relevant drug targets.
In this review, we revisit the concept of relapse to
introduce the notion of EMT transformed CTCs and CSCs.
We highlight the most recent studies demonstrating the
potential contributions of EMT positive CTCs and CSCs
to recurrence and recommend a redesign of the therapeutic
research on CSCs. Improving our understanding of these
cells may help to categorize potential targets for novel
therapies to preclude relapse.

In the era of translational studies and extensive
genomic sequencing, numerous genes have been linked
to dormancy in different types of cancer [32-35]. For
example breast and prostate cancers, NR2F1, SHARP1,
BMP7high and COCOlow signatures induce quiescence and
delayed metastasis [36]. Many investigations recently
interpreted that EMT-transformed cells are linked with
decreased proliferation or quiescence [37-39]. Notably,
the EMT program drives tumor cells to become quiescent
CTCs. Identifying the molecular characteristics of EMT
positive CTCs and CSCs during the latency period are
thus instrumental to determine whether these cells relapse
or remain dormant.
According to experimental and clinical studies, the
microenvironments of certain organs such as the bone
marrow, lung, liver, and brain promote dormancy [40].
The host microenvironments in these tissues maintain
reciprocal signaling with CTCs and CSCs and thus induce
the expression of pro-dormancy genes. Furthermore
these cancer cells are embedded in a niche that provides
a shield from immune surveillance, extending the period
of dormancy.
Survival signals rather than proliferative ones can
be identified in dormant tumor cells and used to prevent
recurrence. In multiple myeloma, bortezomib treatment
causes tumor cells to enter a quiescent phase owing to
activation of the unfolded protein response pathway [41].
Inhibiting eIF2α dephosphorylation in this type of cancer
using the GADD34-PP1c inhibitor decreased the number
of dormant tumor cells and reduced recurrences in this
type of cancer [41]. In breast cancer, low expression of
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (i.e., ERK) and
high levels of p38α were detected in quiescent cancer
cells [42]. Activation of p38α induced at least three
transcription factors- p53 (R213Q), BHLHB3 and NR2F1
and inhibited the expression of FOXM1 and c-JUN, which
are associated with G1-S transition [42, 43]. Some of these

Tumor dormancy and relapse
Tumor dormancy is a state of clinical remission in
which cancer cells remain occult, i.e., indiscernible and
asymptomatic for an extended period of time. Primary
tumors often employ this strategy as a means of resisting
the first line of treatment. The phenomenon of dormancy
is associated with numerous epithelial tumors, including
melanoma and breast, prostate, liver, and thyroid cancer
with variable latency periods [24-29]. Dormancy is
frequently observed in patients with cancer who have
undergone frequent chemo- or radiation therapy [30, 31].
Thus, it is critical to delineate gene signatures associated
with the sequential stages of dormancy including mitoticarrest in dividing tumor cells, the angiogenic switch, and
the escape from immune surveillance and transformation
into relapse initiating cells (Figure 1).

dormancy signature genes were found to delay recurrence
in breast and prostate cancers by suppressing malignant
behavior [44]. Furthermore knockdown or systemic
inhibition of p38α in vivo showed that dormant cells
were capable of regaining tumorigenicity [45]. A recent
study using a head and neck cancer model identified that

transforming growth factor-β 2 (TGFβ2) was increased in
dormant cells [45]. TGFβ2 created a unique signal through
TGFβRIII to induce canonical pathway SMAD1/2/5 to
upregulate p27 and induce non-canonical activation of p38
for dormancy [45].
In addition to p38α and TGFβ2, the composition

Figure 1: Tumor relapse driven by EMT-positive CTCs and CSCs. Upon anti-cancer therapy of primary tumors, EMT-positive
CTCs are detected in large numbers in the peripheral blood. These CTCs migrate through organs such as the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and
bone marrow. Once the tumor cells arrive at their site of relapse, they remain dormant for an extended period and transform into CSCs.
ECM remodeling; p38α, NR2F1, and TGFβ2 signaling; and inhibition of ERK1/2, FAK, FOXM1, and c-JUN pathways facilitate dormancy.
Furthermore, tumor-associated tissue environments provide an embedded niche to protect these cells from anti-cancer therapies or any
other lethal damage. Under ambient conditions, with ECM remodeling and activation of proliferative, angiogenic signaling pathways,
EMT-positive CSCs undergo proliferation to initiate recurrence. These cells are highly resistant to anti-cancer drugs and are capable of
evading immune surveillance.

of cellular proteins, metabolic reprogramming is an
essential step to maintain EMT state for CSCs [57]. Under
nutrient starvation condition, EMT positive CSCs utilizes
glycolytic and ketogenic end products to catabolize
exogenous mitochondrial fuel [57, 58]
These findings suggest that the differentiation state
of tumor cells contributes significantly to acquired drug
resistance. The mechanisms by which tumor cells sustain
the EMT phenotype in the relapse state are highly diverse
between different types of cancer. The enhancement
of mesenchymal-like features may epigenetically
reprogram epithelial cancer cells to adapt well to new
microenvironments and thus may contribute to distant
recurrence.

of the ECM has the potential to determine proliferation
and dormancy. Adhesion to the ECM initiates intracellular
signaling pathways that can increase cell cycle progression,
motility, survival, and other metastatic phenotypes of
tumor cells. For example, downregulation of the urokinase
receptor in squamous cell carcinoma (HEp3) inactivates
α5β1-integrins [46]. Subsequently, focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) signaling is inhibited owing to the cells inability
to bind to fibronectin. This results in dormancy of cancer
cells. Conversely, dormancy to proliferative response
in a fibrotic environment requires collagen-I mediated
integrin β1 signaling, which requires activation of Src
and FAK to phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase in
an ERK dependent manner [47]. Clearly cytoskeletal
rearrangement and ECM composition are critical in
determining whether tumor cells will remain dormant
or metastasize. Thus, inhibiting the growth promoting
changes in an ECM-associated microenvironment may
help prevent relapse.

CTCs and risk of relapse
CTCs have gained huge importance in the design of
therapeutic regimens and monitoring cancer progression in
the era of personalized medicine. Owing to advancements
in single-cell molecular analysis, CTCs are considered a
precursor for metastatic transformation and a predictive
factor of tumor relapse. Compared with the traditional
single-biopsy approach, the analysis of CTCs captures
a broad range of genomic variations. With the use of
next-generation sequencing, CTC profiles are a powerful
clinical indicator for the transition from chemotherapeutic
susceptibility to chemoresistance. Also, the genomic
landscape obtained from these sequencing data greatly
facilitates the identification of druggable therapeutic
targets.
CTCs are heterogeneous and can be broadly
classified into three categories- epithelial, transitioning
from epithelial to mesenchymal and mesenchymal.
We will focus on epithelial and EMT CTCs and their
association with metastatic potential and acquired drug
resistance in adult cancers. Epithelial-origin CTCs are
detected in the peripheral circulation and are believed
to shed periodically from primary or metastatic tumor
sites (Figures 1, 2). Extensive, seminal studies in the past
decade have implicated EMT and CSCs in metastasis and
relapse [15, 18, 59].
Acquisition of the EMT phenotype in CTCs
can indicate the risk of relapse and survival (Figure
1). Compared with epithelial CTCs detected by the
conventional markers EpCAM and cytokeratin, the
high rates of EMT-positive CTCs were associated with
prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
[52]. In breast, prostate, liver, colorectal, head and neck,
pancreatic, endometrial, and lung cancers, the number of
CTCs exhibiting EMT markers increased from early- to
late-stage cases [4, 16, 52, 60, 61]. In a comparative study
between early and metastatic breast cancer cases, CTCs
expressing the EMT markers vimentin and twist increased
from ~73-77% to ~100% of CTCs [16]. In another
study, 14 of 52 primary breast cancers between stages I

EMT and cancer advancement
The EMT program is now known to facilitate the
metastatic spread and progression of cancer cells from
the site of the primary tumor to the surrounding tissues
and distant organ(s). The identification and biological
characterization of the EMT inducing transcription
factors Snail, Slug and Twist showed the cascade of the
tissue remodeling process of epithelial tumors [48, 49].
Overexpression of these EMT signatures changes the
polarity of epithelial cells such that they acquire the
morphological and biochemical traits of mesenchymal
cells. Numerous genes linked with EMT, evidence that
this program is essential for tumor cells to circumvent
apoptosis, anoikis, oncogene addiction, and cellular
senescence and to escape immune surveillance [50].
Understanding and targeting the adaptive growth
of EMT driven cancer cells could lengthen progressionfree survival [51]. A prospective study of 46 patients
with liver cancer showed the EMT markers twist and
Vimentin in 84.8% and 80.4% of those patients’ CTC
samples respectively [52]; tumor progression was closely
correlated with the presence of EMT positive CTCs in
those patients. In patients with non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), resistance to EGFR inhibitors was associated
with EMT induction [53, 54]; in this subset, EMT may
have been promoted through Zeb1 and Src activation
upon overexpression of the growth factor CRIPTO1 [53].
A seminal study by Shao et al highlighted that a loss of
K-Ras signaling was compensated by the transcriptional
coactivator YAP1 to maintain the EMT program during
relapse in a murine lung cancer model [55]. Similarly, the
functional study with High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1)
protein has emphasized its role as a key regulator of
the mesenchymal transition and linked with stem-like
phenotypes in breast cancer [56]. Apart from dynamics

and III received neoadjuvant therapy [10]. Interestingly,
EMT-inducing transcription factors were overexpressed
in neoadjuvant therapy-treated patients compared with
those not treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Similarly, in
patients with colorectal cancer, the novel marker Plastin3
identified the most aggressive CTCs undergoing EMT
in one-third of 711 patients with colorectal cancers [11];
these Plastin3-positive CTCs showed inducible staining of
the EMT marker vimentin.
Another novel marker, cell surface Vimentin (CSV),
has recently been shown to detect EMT-positive CTCs
in breast and colorectal cancer patients [62, 63]. In a

pilot study of 58 patients with metastatic breast cancer,
CSV antibodies demonstrated superior sensitivity (85%
vs 48%) and specificity (94% vs 83%) compared with
EpCAM-based detection for progressive disease upon
treatment. This difference could be attributed to a shifting
of the CTC population toward drug-resistant, dormant, or
both phenotypes. Also, the low detection of CTCs by the
EpCAM antibody was likely due to its nuclear localization
upon disease progression. These studies clearly concluded
the possibility of shortcomings in U.S. Food and Drug
Administration–approved EpCAM-based CTC capture
techniques [16, 64, 65].

Figure 2: Understanding the dynamic equilibrium between EMT positive CTCs and CSCs to define tumor relapse.
Periodic chemo- or radiotherapy on primary tumor induces EMT positive tumor cells. These EMT positive tumor cells are transformed into
quiescent CTCs upon entering into the bloodstream. These EMT positive CTCs express Plastin 3 (PLS3) and cell surface Vimentin (CSV)
on its surface. During relapse phase, EMT positive CTCs reprogram into drug-resistant EMT positive CSCs under ambient condition to
cause poor survival rate for cancer patients.

More than 300 clinical trials are using CTC counts
as an indicator for disease progression and overall
survival (Table 2) [66, 67]. These clinical trials reflect
the translational significance of CTC for monitoring
therapeutic responses to adjuvant therapies. In general,
higher numbers of CTCs (≥5 per 7.5 ml of blood) were
associated with shorter median survival and higher tumor
burden (Table 2). Upon chemotherapeutic treatment,
a decrease in CTC count was associated with an
improvement in median overall survival. Hence, CTC
kinetics has the potential to indicate whether to maintain
current medication or switch therapy. However, most of
these clinical trials used EpCAM as a CTC marker, which
may mean that the assessments of the pharmacodynamics
of the drugs under trial are not optimally accurate. It is
imperative to include the markers Plastin3 and CSV to
detect EMT-positive CTCs for comprehensive, more
precise characterization of CTCs.
Characterizing the EMT phenotype in CTCs
is not sufficient to explain their transformation to a
proliferative state at distant organs; it is critical to shed
light on the variable duration of dormancy and how
these cells are breaking quiescence and are modified into
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

relapse-initiating cells at a secondary site. Recent studies
validated the existence of stem cell–like CTCs, which
have the ability to self-renew, clonally expand, and initiate
tumors, like CSCs can [20, 59, 68, 69]. In 2013, Sun et
al reported the CSC biomarkers CD133 and ABCG2 in
EpCAM-positive CTCs in 82 patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma [70], and they identified the nuclear localization
of β-catenin in 10 of 17 of these patients with EpCAMpositive CTCs. The authors concluded that EpCAMpositive CTCs with stem cell–like phenotypes might
represent a subset of CTCs with a more aggressive
phenotype, earlier recurrence, and worse survival. Further
studies are required to explore these stem cell–like CTCs
to predict the recurrence timeframe and determine the
therapeutic window of treatment for better survival.

CSCs and relapse
CSCs are a rare subset of tumor cells that bear
properties of stem cells, and they show the greatest
diversity in cancer progression. Recently, substantial
progress has been made in understanding CSCs by
characterizing genetic and epigenetic changes occur in

their dormant and relapsed stages (Figures 1, 2); however,
the surface markers may not unequivocally enrich all
CSCs. To date, researchers have identified a few surface
markers that enrich various CSCs from the primary tumor
for the majority of cancer types. Tumor dormancy and
therapeutic refractoriness in different types of cancer are
due largely to CSCs and their clonal evolution [71-74].
However, because of the repeated refinement of the CSCs
on the basis of new markers, it is difficult to categorize
the exact or overlapping populations responsible for
promoting the processes of dissemination, intravasation,
dormancy, and relapse. Also, self-replicative and nondifferentiating cancer stemloids are a topic of considerable
interest to pursue effective anti-cancer therapy [74, 75].
These stem-like cells play a seminal role in therapyresistant relapse due to diverse oncogenic mutations in
their clonal populations [75]. Thus, selectively targeting
cancer stemloids might provide better therapeutic response
for cancer patients.
Our increasing understanding of the molecular
biology and aberrantly activated cellular pathways of
CSCs has revealed a number of novel targets for targeted
therapeutic regimens that have successfully reduced
CSCs both in vitro and in preclinical models (Table 3).
An example is that upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathway
has been detected to maintain mesenchymal state and
chemoresistance in breast cancer cells [76]. Using this
molecular concept in preclinical study showed that BH3mimetics were capable to remove both epithelial and
mesenchymal HMLE (Human Mammary with Large
T and TERT) cells [76]. Therefore, drugs suppressing

CSCs hold great promise for redefining cancer therapy in
advanced-stage cases. However, CSCs undergo dynamic
clonal modification during the metastatic cascade,
chemotherapeutic treatments, dormancy, and relapse.
Because of their highly heterogeneous nature, relapseinitiating CSCs must be captured and characterized, as
most conventional anti-cancer therapies have limited
success in eradicating them in patients. A recent study
on prostate cancer cells showed that EMT-positive CSCs
exhibit resistance to radiation therapy via the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway [19]. The biologic link between EMT
phenotypes and CSCs has recently been evidenced
by epigenetic programming in many types of cancer
[77, 78]. In breast cancer cells, Snail interacts with
methyltransferase G9a to recruit DNA methyltransferase
at the E-cadherin promoter region to silence its expression
under low-glucose conditions [78]. In malignant
pediatric brain tumor ATRT (Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid
tumor), activated STAT3 regulates EMT phenotypes in
association with Snail in cisplatin resistant cells [79]. A
recent work found that nuclear localized PKCθ acts as a
chromatin-anchored switch for EMT to induce expression
of mesenchymal genes [78]. Furthermore, the long
noncoding RNA Hotair is overexpressed upon TGFβ
pathway activation in many cases of cancer [80]; Hotair
interacts with polycomb repressive complex 2 to promote
methylation at the promoter regions of epithelial genes and
involved EMT progression [80, 81].
It has been demonstrated that a subset of isolated
CSCs expresses EMT phenotypes in numerous cancers
[82-84]. Unfortunately, no suitable marker can enrich

EMT-transformed CSCs that are phenotypically different
from primary tumor–derived CSCs. To avoid relapse,
these cells must be detected in a dormant phase, which
may last from a few months to many years.
Some studies validated stem cell–like properties
in CTCs [20, 59], suggesting that CSCs transformed into
these CTCs and then became dormant. During relapse,
they may then become EMT-positive CSCs that proliferate
as relapse-initiating cells forming aggressive tumors.
Considering the immense clinical significance of these
CSCs, it is important to develop strategies to enrich these
cells for molecular understanding of relapse. Application
of conventional surface markers of CSCs has proven
difficult owing to the dynamic clonal evolution of these
cells in response to chemotherapy, dormancy, and new
tumor microenvironments.
One potential alternative strategy for enriching
CSCs is using CTC markers, which can enrich EMTpositive populations, as EMT-positive cancer cells are
indicators of aggressive relapse in cancer patients [85].
Thus, isolating EMT-transformed CSCs using CTC surface
markers from the relapse site and from the primary tumor
could provide a comprehensive picture of the etiologies
of relapse. Substantial and systematic research focusing
on drug-resistant, relapse-initiating CSCs could promote
the development of effective treatment for aggressive
cancer, and the identification and culture of these CSCs
could be a powerful tool in the investigation of cancer
relapse. Also, the identification of aberrant pathways in
relapse-initiating CSCs could facilitate the development of
therapies for patients for whom traditional chemotherapies
and radiation treatments have poor clinical outcomes.

interaction between tumor microenvironments and cancer
cells, EMT-positive CSCs frequently undergo genetic
drift and clonal evolution, so novel pharmacologic
agents that demonstrate better therapeutic efficacy than
current neoadjuvant therapies need to be generated.
As translational research is streamlined toward more
personalized therapy, suppressing EMT-transformed CTCs
and CSCs should prove useful for preventing relapse and
extending the lifespans of patients with recurrent cancer.

heterogeneity of tumors in patients and the difficulty of
capturing residual drug-resistant tumor cells. Thus, recent
research has aimed to identify suitable clinical models
that can accurately catalog the steps of cancer recurrence.
Clinical studies indicate that harnessing EMT-transformed
CTCs and CSCs could shed light on the transition from
dormancy to relapse in cancer patients. Future therapeutic
studies of CSCs should focus on EMT positive CSCs
or relapse-initiating tumor cells rather than just CSCs
enriched from primary tumors. The molecular and cellular
plasticity of EMT-positive cells needs to be characterized
to categorize aberrant molecular pathways and heterotypic
interactions with tumor microenvironments. Furthermore,
ECM remodeling that supports the EMT program in tumor
cells to initiate drug resistance and relapse is required to
allow more in-depth tracing.
Currently, neoadjuvant therapy is recommended
for patients who are at risk of recurrence after resection
of the primary tumor. However, because of the dynamic
