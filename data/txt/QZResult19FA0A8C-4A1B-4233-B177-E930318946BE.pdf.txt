ABSTRACT
Deletion of CDKN2A (p16) or amplification of CCND1 (cyclin D1) occurs commonly
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and induces sustained cyclindependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 activation. Here, we report the antiproliferative activity
of LY2835219, a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor through inhibition of CDK4/6-dependent
Ser780 phosphorylation in retinoblastoma (RB) and induction of cell cycle arrest in
HNSCC cells. In addition, we demonstrated the antitumor effects of HNSCC xenografts
to LY2835219 in vivo. Given the limited effect in HNSCC as a single-agent treatment
with LY2835219, a combinational strategy is required to enhance antitumor activity.
At the molecular level, we found that LY2835219 inhibited activation of AKT and
ERK, but not mTOR. The combination of LY2835219 with mTOR inhibitor was found
to be more effective than either drug alone in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our
findings suggest that a combinational treatment with LY2835219 and mTOR inhibitor
is a promising therapeutic approach for HNSCC.

INTRODUCTION

CCND1 (cyclin D1; ~94%) in HNSCC [2, 4, 7, 8]. Cyclin
D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) phosphorylates
and inactivates RB, leading to release and activation of E2F
transcription factors. E2Fs, in turn, initiate a transcription
required for G1-S progression. Overexpression of cyclin
D1 and resulting CDK4/6 hyperactivation are considered
to be major oncogenic drivers [9]. p16, a potent inhibitor
of CDK4/6, inhibits cyclin D1 interaction with CDK4/6
and prevents phosphorylation of the RB [10]. This sustains
RB-mediated sequestration of E2F, thereby preventing cell
cycle progression from the G1 to S phase. CDKN2A (p16)
disruption has been reported as a frequent event in HNSCC
and this alteration consequently promotes CDK4/6-mediated
phosphorylation of RB [2, 11]. Thus, CDK4/6 inhibition can
impede cell growth and targeting CDK4/6 with novel smallmolecule inhibitor is one potential approach to treatment of
HNSCC.
LY2835219 is an orally bioavailable drug that
selectively inhibits CDK4/6 in the nanomolar range
[12] and shows anti-proliferative activity in a number
of tumor models in vitro and in vivo [13]. Antitumor

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
refers to a large heterogeneous group of cancers of the lip,
oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx [1, 2].
Locoregional recurrence and metastasis to lymph nodes
occur in 40–60% of HNSCC and are associated with poor
prognosis and low survival [3]. Despite recent advances
in basic and clinical research, standard treatments for
HNSCC including surgery, radiation or chemotherapy have
not significantly improved survival rates [4]. Although
cetuximab is the only approved targeted-therapy for
HNSCC, the clinical use of cetuximab is usually limited by
intrinsic or acquired resistance [5, 6]. Thus, there remain
unmet medical needs for HNSCC and alternative treatment
strategies are urgently needed.
Sustained proliferation is a hallmark of human
malignancies. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor
plays a critical role in regulating cellular proliferation. The
RB tumor suppressor pathway is frequently altered through
deletion of CDKN2A (p16; ~35%) or amplification of

activity of LY2835219 was also observed in colon cancer,
lung cancer, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and
mantle cell lymphoma [13]. In vivo, LY2835219 inhibits
CDK4/6 at clinically achievable plasma concentrations
(~400 nM), resulting in a G1 arrest that can be sustained
with continuous oral dosing. Phase I study in advanced
solid tumorsdemonstrated clinical efficacy at plasma
concentrations of ~562 nM [13]. Currently, phase II or
III clinical studies of LY2835219 are ongoing in several
malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer.
However, the effect of LY2835219 on HNSCC has not been
tested so far.
In this study, we explored the therapeutic effects
of CDK4/6 inhibition, using the novel small-molecule
CDK4/6 inhibitor, LY2835219 in both cell lines and
tumor xenograft models of HNSCC. Our results show
that CDK4/6 inhibition can have a potent antiproliferative
effect on HNSCC, and specific combination with mTOR
inhibitor significantly increases the therapeutic potency of
LY2835219 in HNSCC.

were treated with LY2835219 at concentrations ranging
between 0.01 μM and 10 μM for 72 h. This treatment
reduced cell viability at HNSCC cells (Figure 1A). The IC50
values for LY2835219 ranged from 0.5 μM to 0.7 μM at
HNSCC cells. In addition, LY2835219 inhibited colony
formation with long term treatment (Figure 1B), indicating
that LY2835219 was able to effectively suppress colony
formation of HNSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1B).
To examine the mechanisms of how LY2835219
reduced cell viability, we investigated the effects of
LY2835219 on cell proliferation and cell death. As shown
in Figure 2A, LY2835219 inhibited cell proliferation in
a dose-dependent manner in OSC-19 cells. However,
no significant increase of LDH release was observed at
a lower concentration (< 1 μM) (Figure 2B). The LDH
measurement estimates membrane damage and, therefore,
is indicative for cell death. To demonstrate inhibition of
CDK4 by LY2835219, we also analyzed the cell cycle.
Cell cycle analysis demonstrated cell cycle arrest at G0–G1
without apoptosis and decreased proportion of S and
G2–M phase following 24 h of exposure to LY2835219
(Figure 2C). These effects were sustained for 48 h after
treatment (data not shown). In line with the ability of
LY2835219 to induce G0–G1 arrest, LY2835219 also
reduced RB phosphorylation at Ser780 and increased p21
expression in both a concentration- and time-dependent
manner (Figure 3A and 3B). These data suggest the ability
of LY2835219 to induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit cell
proliferation in HNSCC.

RESULTS
LY2835219 decreases cell growth and induces
cell cycle arrest in HNSCC cell lines
LY2835219 is a novel, selective CDK4/6 inhibitor in
clinical development. To demonstrate its impact on HNSCC
in vitro, we examined the effects of LY2835219 using three
HNSCC cell lines (OSC-19, FaDu, and YD-10B). Cells

LY2835219 inhibits Akt and ERK signaling but
not mTOR activation

a combinatorial drug treatment using two different mTOR
inhibitors, torin2 and everolimus. Everolimus is used in
chemotherapeutic regimens against various types of cancers
and torin2 exhibits greater anti-proliferative activity in
several cancer cell lines [14–16]. Cell viability was assessed
after treatment with increasing doses of mTOR inhibitors
in the absence and presence of LY2835219. First, we
tested the effect of mTOR inhibitors on cell viability in
OSC-19 cells (Figure 4A and 4B). As the concentration
of up to 10 nM torin2 and everolimus did not significantly
affect cell viability, these concentrations were chosen
for combination. Intriguingly, bothLY2835219-Torin2
(Figure 4C) and LY2835219-everolimus (Figure 4D)
combination significantly reduced cell viability. Based on
the CI index, torin2 (Figure 4E) and everolimus (Figure 4F)
in combination with LY2835219 showed a synergistic effect
(CI < 1) on suppression of cell viability. These effects were
dose-dependent in both drugs but everolimus showed a more
prominent effect than torin2 at a lower concentration. Thus,
we used everolimus for further in vivo study.

Despite the growth inhibitory effects, LY2835219
was not as effective as single agent as was initially hoped.
Thus, we further investigated the molecular mechanism
of LY2835219 in HNSCC to find ways to improve the
antitumor effects. As the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/
ERK pathways are known to be targetable oncogenic drivers
in HNSCC [4], we examined the effects of LY2835219 on
these pathways. OSC-19 cells were treated with 0.1, 0.2,
and 0.5 μM LY2835219, and levels of p-AKT (Ser473),
p-ERK1/2 (thr202/Tyr204), and p-mTOR (Ser2448)
were measured with Western blot analysis. Treatment
of cells with LY2835219 inhibited phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 and AKT in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
3C). Inhibition of AKT by LY2835219 persisted for 48
h after treatment. In contrast, phosphorylation of ERK
had recovered at 48 h (Figure 3D). Unexpectedly, in
spite of inhibition of AKT, LY2835219 had no effect
on phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 (Figure 3C
and 3D), suggesting continuous activation of mTORC1.

in vivo

Combination of LY2835219 and mTOR inhibitor
shows synergistic effect in HNSCC

To evaluate the efficacy of LY2835219 in HNSCC
in vivo, we generated tumor xenografts derived from OSC19 cells. Mice bearing tumor xenografts were treated once
daily for 14 days with LY2835219 (45 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg)

To test whether sustained mTOR activation causes a
moderate effect of LY2835219 in HNSCC, we performed

or with a vehicle control as previously described [12, 13].
This dosing strategy was tolerable, as no body weight loss or
other signs of toxicity were observed. As shown in Figure 5A
and 5B, LY2835219 significantly decreased tumor growth
of OSC-19 xenografts during treatment. At the end point of
the experiment, tumors were harvested and monitored by
Western blot and immunohistochemistry using antibodies
against p-Rb (Ser780), p21, p-AKT (Ser473), and p-mTOR
(Ser2448). Treatment of mice with LY2835219 resulted in a
profound dose-dependent inhibition of p-Rb (S780) (Figure
5C and 5D). Concomitant with this change, an increase
in p21 expression was observed (Figure 5C and 5D),

which may reflect a G0–G1 arrest by LY2835219. In
concordance with in vitro results, LY2835219 treatment
reduced phosphorylation of AKT, but had no effects on
mTOR activation.

LY2835219 in combination with everolimus
causes a cooperative antitumor effect in HNSCC
xenograft tumor
The observed antitumor effect of the LY2835219 and
everolimus combination in vitro suggested the possibility
of similar efficacy in vivo. To determine this possibility,

protein levels of CD31 in the tumor xenograft. Treatment
with both LY2835219 and everolimus reduced intratumoral
microvessels (CD31) (Figure 6E). Taken together, these
results suggest that the combination of LY2835219 and
mTOR inhibitor has a synergistic therapeutic effect on
HNSCC.

the efficacy of LY2835219 and everolimus combination
was examined in vivo. Mice bearing OSC-19 were
treated with vehicle, LY2835219 (45 mg/kg), everolimus
(5 mg/kg), or combination of LY2835219 and
everolimus. Both LY2835219 and everolimus alone
inhibited tumor growth. The combination yielded greater
inhibition of tumor growth than either treatment alone
(Figure 6A and 6B). No significant changes in body weight
were found between four groups during the treatment
periods. To validate the action mechanism of LY2835219
and everolimus combination, tumors were further analyzed
by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. As expected,
phosphorylation of mTOR was effectively inhibited by
everolimus combination compared to LY2835219 alone
(Figure 6C and 6D). Given CDK4/6 inhibitor has been
reported to have an anti-angiogenic activity [17, 18], we
performed immunohistochemistry analysis to detect the

DISCUSSION
HNSCC displays a handful of widespread genomic
alterations that can be evaluated as potential therapeutic
targets for personalized medicine. Over-activation of
CDK4/CDK6 after CDKN2A loss or CCND1 amplification
causes higher RB phosphorylation and drives cell cycle
progression [19, 20]. Thus, CDK inhibitor could be an
attractive anticancer therapy [10, 21]. LY2835219, an
ATP-competitive dual inhibitor of CDK4/6, is an orally

bioavailable drug in glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia,
mantle cell lymphoma, colon and lung xenografts [13, 21].
LY2835219 has also been shown to cross the blood-brain
barrier [19, 21]. In preclinical studies, LY2835219 enhances
the effects of chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that it
can be used in multidrug therapeutic regimens. Currently,
LY2835219 is being investigated in phase I-III clinical
trials for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, mantle cell
lymphoma, and metastatic breast cancer [20]. In this study,
we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the selective
CDK4/6 inhibitor LY2835219 in treating HNSCC.
The data presented here show that CDK4/6 inhibition
is a feasible therapeutic strategy in HNSCC. By using

LY2835219, we observed RB hypophosphorylation, cell
cycle arrest, and dose-dependent tumor growth reduction
in HNSCC in vitro and in vivo. In addition, LY2835219
treatment inhibited angiogenesis in tumor xenograft which
is consistent with previous studiesn [17, 18]. We further
examined the molecular mechanism of LY2835219 in
these cells. As expected, LY2835219 inhibited activation
of AKT and ERK, signaling molecules important for the
survival and growth of cancer cells. However, treatment
of HNSCC cells with LY2835219 had no effects on
Ser2448 phosphorylation of mTOR regardless of AKT
and ERK inactivation. Such sustained mTOR activity
after CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment has been reported in

previous study [10]. mTOR is a key downstream signaling
component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and ERK
was shown to activate mTOR though inhibition of TSC2
[22]. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase that controls
cell survival and growth by regulating various cellular
processes. It triggers oncogenic mechanisms including
cancer cell survival, cell cycle progression, proliferation,
transcription and translation, angiogenesis, invasion, and
metastasis [23–25]. Although the persistent activation
of AKT/mTOR pathway is a feature of HNSCC [7, 26],
activating mutations of mTOR have not been reported
previously. Thus, we hypothesized that constant mTOR
activation after LY2835219 treatment may cause the modest
antiproliferative effect of LY2835219 as a single agent. To
prove this, we tested whether dual inhibition of CDK4/6
and mTOR could synergistically induce the antitumor
effects in HNSCC.
In the current study, the cogency of cotargeting
CDK4/6 and mTOR simultaneously in HNSCC cell
lines was confirmed by significant increases in growth
inhibition which was observed following treatment with
the everolimus in combination with LY2835219 compared
with either agent alone. Further, we confirmed everolimus
treatment had no effects on Rb phosphorylation (data not
shown), and demonstrate that the cotargeting CDK4/6
and mTOR is an attractive targeted therapy for HNSCC.
Previous work has indicated that mTOR-specific inhibitors
are available and show potent activity against various
cancers in preclinical and clinical models [27, 28]. In
addition, several studies have suggested that mTOR inhibitor
can enhance the efficacy of different chemotherapeutic
agents in various cancers [6, 29, 30]. Everolimus, an
inhibitor of mTOR in its complex mTORC1, has shown a
remarkable antitumor effect against renal cell carcinoma,
breast cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors, leading to the
food and drug authority (FDA) appoval for the treatment of
advanced renal cell carcinoma and metastatic breast cancer.
As a results, everolimus is currently part of therapy regimes
for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer,
gastric cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, as
well as HNSCC [15, 16, 23, 27, 31]. Torin2 is a secondgeneration ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor with a superior
pharmacokinetic profile to previous inhibitors. It has been
shown to have an antitumor effect in several cancers
[14, 32, 33]. The combination of rapamycin, an mTOR
inhibitor, with paclitaxel has been shown to significantly
increase growth inhibition over paclitaxel alone in HNSCC
cell lines [34]. Recently, it was also reported that everolimus
can enhance the effect of docetaxel in HNSCC [35].
Furthermore, a phase I studies of mTOR inhibitors plus
weekly cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy
for patients with head and neck cancer and a phase I study of
mTOR inhibitors plus docetaxel plus cisplatin as induction
chemotherapy for patients with locally and/or regionally
advanced head and neck cancer are recently completed

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[36, 37]. These findings suggest that mTOR inhibitors can
be combined with current treatment strategies for head and
neck cancer, such as radiation or chemotherapy.
In summary, we show the potential use of LY2835219
and combined with mTOR inhibition in HNSCC. Both
LY2835219 and mTOR inhibitor suppressed tumor growth
of HNSCC as single agent, and the combination of these
two agents resulted in synergistic tumor growth inhibition.
Thus, the development of an effective therapeutic strategy
for HNSCC using a combination of LY2835219 and mTOR
inhibitor should be further investigated.

LY2835219 (45 mg/kg/d or 90 mg/kg/d), Everolimus
(5 mg/kg/d), or a combination of both. The LY2835219
was dissolved in 1% HEC in 20 mM phosphate buffer
(pH2.0). Tumor size and body weight were measured
twice weekly. Tumor volumes were calculated using the
following formula: V = (L × W2)/2 (L, Length; W, width).
Mice were gavaged a final time on day 14 and sacrificed
the following day. The tumors were removed for Western
blot and immunohistochemistry. All procedures involving
animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Samsung
Biomedical Research Institute (SBRI). SBRI is an
Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care International (AAALAC International)
accredited facility and abides by the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources (ILAR) guidelines.

Long-term viability assay was performed by colony
formation assay. In brief, cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and allowed to adhere overnight then treated with DMSO
control (0.1% v/v) or LY2835219. Media were changed
every 3 days with fresh reagents added. Following 10-day
treatment, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet.
Colonies with > 50 cells were quantified using ImageJ
(NIH, Bethesda, MA).

Cell cycle
Cells were treated with DMSO control (0.1% v/v) or
LY2835219 for 24 h and harvested. After washing with icecold PBS, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Fixed
cells were stained with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 20 μg/ml
propidium iodide. DNA content was analyzed by flow
cytometry (BD Biosciences).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 μm
sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.
Following deparaffinization and rehydration of the slides,
antigen retrieval was performed using Citrate buffer (pH 6.0).
After endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with
3% hydrogen peroxide, sections were incubated at room
temperature with indicated antibodies for 2 h. Sections
were further processed with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody and then developed
with 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Finally, the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were obtained
with an Olympus BX51 microscope.

Cell death assay
A cell death assay based on the release of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) was conducted using LDH
Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (TaKaRa). Cells were seeded in
96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were
treated as indicated concentrations of LY2835219 in low
serum (1%) medium according to manufacturer’s protocol.
After 24 to 72 h treatment, culture medium form each well
was collected and transferred into 96-well flat bottom plates.
LDH activity was determined by adding equal volumes of
reaction mixture to each well and incubating for 30 min. The
absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a plate reader
and cell death was calculated according to manufacturer’s
protocol.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical
analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
software, La Jolla, CA). P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All reported P-values were twosided.
