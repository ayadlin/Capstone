BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for patients with locally advanced breast cancer and can
yield clinical advantages in individuals with lower stage cancers as well. To the authors’ knowledge, the extent and patterns of use of
NAC remain unknown. The objective of the current study was to assess temporal trends in NAC use and to examine what clinical, demographic, and treatment site characteristics influence its use. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base regarding
395,486 patients with stage I to stage III breast cancer who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the United States
from 2003 through 2011 were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association
between NAC use and patient, tumor, and facility characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 17.4% of patients received NAC, including 4% of
patients with stage I disease, 17.8% of patients with stage II disease, and 41.6% of patients with stage III disease. NAC use increased
over time from 12.2% to 24.0%, particularly among patients with more advanced cancers. Rates increased from 12.9% to 39.3% in
patients with stage IIIA, from 72.3% to 86.4% in patients with stage IIIB, and from 30.1% to 59.3% in patients with stage IIIC cancers.
On multivariate analysis, patients aged <60 years, African American individuals, and those treated in academic centers were more
likely to receive NAC. NAC use also varied by geographic region and was the highest in the West South Central region (21%) and lowest in the Midwest (15.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Although NAC use increased between 2003 and 2011, <50% of all patients with stage III

INTRODUCTION
The use of chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer has been shown to reduce both disease recurrence and
breast cancer-specific mortality.1 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for patients with large, inoperable, or inflammatory breast cancers. For some of these patients, the use of NAC can lead to increased breast conservation
rates, and even among patients who are eligible for breast conservation at the time of diagnosis, NAC may allow for a
smaller surgical resection volume.2-4 Regardless of tumor size, NAC also provides an opportunity to directly assess the cytotoxic activity of a treatment regimen, and there are intriguing data to suggest that clinical response-guided NAC may
improve survival.5 Finally, the pathologic stage and residual cancer burden after the completion of NAC are powerful
prognostic indicators, and patients who achieve a pathologic complete response are reported to have excellent long-term
survival.6-8 Several randomized trials have demonstrated that adjuvant chemotherapy and NAC result in identical longterm survival among patients with stage I to stage III breast cancer,2,3,9,10 and the finding of improved survival, particularly among patients with the more aggressive triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive subtypes, was confirmed in a large meta-analysis of 12 international neoadjuvant clinical trials representing nearly
12,000 patients.11

Timing of Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer/Mougalian et al

Despite its potential advantages, there are several
factors that limit the broad adoption of NAC in routine
clinical practice. Potential barriers to the use of NAC
include the higher complexity of monitoring tumor
response, the small risk of cancer progression during therapy (approximately 3% with current third-generation
chemotherapy regimens),12 and the possibility of delayed
surgery if complications arise during chemotherapy.
Some physicians also perceive loss of prognostic information when NAC is used because the true pathologic stage
of the tumor and axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis would not be established unless the axilla is staged
before neoadjuvant therapy, and this may impact
decision-making regarding postmastectomy radiotherapy.
Others might be hesitant to use NAC in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors because the rates of pathologic complete response are lower.13 However, it is clear
that there is prognostic information in a patient’s response
to NAC.
To our knowledge, the clinical circumstances in
which NAC is used in clinical practice in the United
States remain unknown. The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) breast cancer treatment guidelines recommend NAC in patients with locally advanced
disease. For patients with stage IIA or stage IIB disease,
or patients with stage IIIA and limited lymph node disease, NAC should be considered, particularly if breast
conservation is desired. The NCCN algorithm does not
recommend for or against NAC for the treatment of
clinical stage I breast cancer. Underuse of NAC, particularly among patients with high-risk breast cancers, would
be concerning, particularly because newer targeted therapies and clinical trials are approved only in this setting.
The goal of the current analysis was to assess temporal
trends in the use of NAC, assess its use across treatment
recommendation groups, and to examine the clinical,
demographic, and treatment site characteristics that
influence its use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Sample Selection

The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is a joint project
of the American Cancer Society and the Commission on
Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. The American College of Surgeons has executed a business associate
agreement that includes a data use agreement with each of
its Commission on Cancer-accredited hospitals. The
NCDB, established in 1989, is a nationwide, facilitybased, comprehensive, clinical surveillance resource onCancer

cology data set that currently captures 70% of all newly
diagnosed malignancies in the United States annually.
The current study sample consisted of women diagnosed
with breast cancer between 2003 and 2011 and corresponds to the most recent data release available at the time
of the analysis (Fig. 1). We excluded women who met the
following criteria: those who did not receive definitive surgery, did not receive chemotherapy, had any prior cancer
diagnosis, or had clinical evidence of distant metastases at
the time of initial staging and those in whom the sequence
of surgery and chemotherapy was not clear, those who had
unknown time to surgery or chemotherapy, or those who
received neoadjuvant hormone therapy. Finally, we
2545

Original Article

further excluded women who initiated systemic chemotherapy >270 days before surgery or <84 days
before surgery to exclude those women who had either extended delays to surgery or received suboptimal
neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens. We also
excluded women who started systemic chemotherapy
>90 days after surgery to exclude those patients who
might be receiving chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Finally, we restricted the sample to women with
stage I to stage III disease. Clinical stage at diagnosis
was used when available; however, when clinical staging information was missing, pathologic stage (determined at the time of surgery) was used.
Construction of Variables

Sociodemographic characteristics included in the current analysis were age at diagnosis, race, ethnicity, median household income at the zip code level, type of
insurance, and population size of the patient’s area of
residence (eg, metropolitan, urban, and rural). Clinical
characteristics included American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) tumor (T) and lymph node (N) stage,
histologic grade, hormone receptor status, and year of
diagnosis. HER2 information was not included due to
the large amount of missing data. Facility characteristics
included facility type (academic center, comprehensive
community cancer center, or community practice) and
location by US geographic region.
The outcome of interest was the timing of NAC,
determined by comparing the number of days from diagnosis to the initiation of chemotherapy with the number
of days from diagnosis to receipt of definitive surgery. If
the number of days from diagnosis to definitive surgery
was longer than the number of days from diagnosis to the
initiation of chemotherapy, the patient was categorized as
having received NAC. As noted above, women who initiated chemotherapy >270 days or <84 days before definitive surgery or >90 days after definitive surgery were
excluded. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based
on the NCCN’s recommendations regarding the use of
NAC.14 It is interesting to note that NCCN treatment
recommendations regarding treatment sequence
remained constant throughout the study period. Group 1
included patients with stage I disease for whom there is no
NCCN recommendation for NAC. Group 2 included
patients for whom NAC should be considered and consisted of patients with stage IIA, stage IIB, and a subset of
stage IIIA (T3N1) cancers. Group 3 included all remaining patients with stage IIIA disease as well as all patients
with stage IIIB and stage IIIC disease.

Statistical Analysis

We used chi-square tests to determine whether receipt of
NAC was associated with each of the covariates among
the entire sample. We then used bivariate and multivariate
logistic regression models to determine the odds of receipt
of NAC according to the different patient and facility
factors. The logistic regression models were restricted
to patients in NCCN group 3, for whom NAC is
strongly recommended. To assess factors associated
with the use of NAC in the most contemporary area,
we limited this analysis to the last 3 available years
(2009-2011). We conducted a sensitivity analysis of
patients who had an identifiable clinical N classification before any treatment decisions. All analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The Yale University
Human Investigation Committee determined that this
study was exempt from review.
RESULTS
The study sample consisted of 395,486 patients diagnosed with stage I to stage III breast cancer between
2003 and 2011 who received either adjuvant chemotherapy or NAC. Excluded from this sample were 8219
women who received preoperative endocrine therapy in
addition to chemotherapy and 2848 women who
received preoperative endocrine therapy without chemotherapy. The mean age of patients in this cohort was
53.6 years. Patients were predominantly white (82.1%),
privately insured (69.1%), and lived in metropolitan
communities (78.6%) (Table 1). The vast majority of
patients had no comorbid conditions (88.7%). The most
frequent stage at the time of diagnosis was stage IA
(132,430 patients; 33.5%), followed by stage IIA
(32.4%); approximately one-half of the cancers were histologic grade 3.
Overall, the rates of NAC increased from 12.2% in
2003 to 24.0% in 2011 (Table 1). Patients aged <60
years, African American patients, and Hispanic patients
were more likely to receive NAC. In addition, higher rates
of NAC were noted among patients living in lowerincome zip codes, those with Medicaid or no insurance,
and those receiving treatment in metropolitan areas.
Patients with no comorbid conditions received NAC
more frequently than those with 1 comorbidities.
Patients with stage I disease received NAC infrequently (approximately 4%), whereas rates were highest
for patients with stage IIIB disease (78.6%). However,
only 41.6% of patients with stage III cancer received
NAC during the study period.

Approximately one-half of the current study sample
had histologic grade 3 tumors, and a higher tumor grade
was associated with higher rates of NAC receipt. Hormone receptor status was known for 87.4% of the sample
(345,692 patients), and patients with hormone receptornegative cancers had higher rates of receipt of NAC
(23.5% vs 15.4%; P<.001). HER2 status was not
included in our model because it was not routinely collected in the NCDB until 2010. However, of the patients
in the current study sample diagnosed in 2010 and 2011,
we were able to identify 20,630 patients (23.7%) with
HER2-positive breast cancer, which was defined as positive by either immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in
situ hybridization. Among those patients, 26.9% received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 73.1% received adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Patients receiving treatment in an academic or
research setting were more likely to receive NAC
(P<.001). NAC use also varied by geographic region and

was highest in the West South Central region (21%) and
lowest in the Midwest (15.2%). Patients who underwent
NAC had higher rates of undergoing mastectomy
(69.6%) compared with women who received adjuvant
chemotherapy (46.0%).
Rates of NAC use increased from 2003 through
2011 in all 3 NCCN recommendation groups, although
the absolute value of NAC use varied considerably across
the 3 groups. In patients in group 1 (those with no recommendation for NAC), use of NAC increased from 2.3%
to 5.2%. In patients in group 2 (NAC should be considered), use of NAC increased from 12.4% to 30.9%. In
patients in group 3 (NAC strongly recommended), use of
NAC increased from 30.1% to 59.3% (Fig. 2).
Among the patients in group 3, those with stage IIIB
breast cancer were significantly more likely to receive
NAC (78.6%) than were patients with either stage IIIA
(30.1%) or stage IIIC (59.3%) disease. When examined
over time, rates of NAC use increased for all groups from
2003 to 2011: from 12.9% to 39.3% for patients with
stage IIIA disease, from 72.3% to 86.4% for patients with
stage IIIB disease, and from 19.9% to 53.2% for patients
with stage IIIC disease (Fig. 3).
To determine what factors influenced NAC use
among those patients for whom NAC is strongly recommended, we focused on the 3 most recent years of available data (2009-2011). These data are shown in Table 2.
Younger age, African American race, private insurance, no
comorbidities, higher stage of disease at diagnosis, higher
2548

tumor grade, negative hormone receptor status, later year
of diagnosis, treatment in a comprehensive cancer center,
and median household income were all found to be significant predictors of NAC use on bivariate analysis. US geographical region and treatment in urban settings were also
found to be predictors of NAC use. On multivariate analysis, all these factors (with the exception of median household income) remained significant independent
predictors of NAC use.
In the current analysis, we included patients who
were staged either clinically or pathologically (if clinical
staging was not available), which could alter the association between stage of disease and NAC use because NAC
frequently results in the downstaging of cancers. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the analysis was rerun after restricting the sample to those patients for whom
clinical stage was available (30,157 patients [52%] of all
group 3 patients). The results in this clinically staged subset were similar to those of the entire group 3 cohort (see
Supporting Information Table 1). The odds ratios for
NAC receipt increased over the time period studied, but
to a lesser extent than in the entire sample (eg, for 2011 vs
2009: odds ratio, 1.39 [95% confidence interval, 1.261.54]).
DISCUSSION
The rate of preoperative therapy with cytotoxic agents
increased from 12.2% in 2003 to 24.0% by 2011. It is
interesting to note that among those patients for whom

NCCN guidelines recommend NAC as the preferred
sequence of therapy, we found that only approximately
40% of patients received NAC over the entire study period, although this percentage had increased to nearly
60% by 2011. The lack of adoption of breast cancer
guidelines has been observed in other treatment modalities, such as postmastectomy radiation.15 Even in the
most recent year available (2011), only 39% of patients
with stage IIIA disease and 53% of patients with stage
IIIC disease received NAC. It is possible that some of
these patients may have been diagnosed with a lower clinical stage of disease, were undocumented in the NCDB,
and were upstaged at the time of surgery. However, this is
unlikely to be a major confounder because approximately
80% of cancers demonstrate clinical response in the
breast, and 40% of biopsy-proven lymph node metastases
are downstaged to N0 status by third-generation NAC.16
It is also possible that our methods excluded patients who
had locally advanced breast cancer, underwent NAC, and
never became operable.
There are several barriers that may slow the adoption
of NAC in practice, particularly in the community. In the
absence of any survival advantage for NAC over postoperative chemotherapy, medical oncologists may opt for adjuvant treatment because it does not require active
monitoring of tumor response. Adjuvant treatment may
also fit more seamlessly with patient referral flow from
surgeons. Breast surgeons may not routinely refer patients
Cancer

August 1, 2015

preoperatively to a medical oncologist. Furthermore,
patients themselves may incorrectly perceive a risk in
delaying surgery to receive preoperative chemotherapy or
prefer to undergo surgery first. In addition, NAC offers
the advantage of potentially downsizing a cancer, making
patients who would otherwise be candidates for mastectomy eligible for breast conservation. With the growing
trend toward mastectomy, surgeons and patients alike
may not appreciate the need for primary systemic therapy.17-19 The current analysis did find higher rates of mastectomy among patients who received NAC, but these
data do not allow us to determine the reason that mastectomy was performed in either group.
Among the patients for whom the NCCN strongly
recommends the use of NAC, we noted a significant discrepancy between likelihood of receipt of NAC for patients
with stage IIIB disease (approximately 80%) and those
with stage IIIA/IIIC disease (approximately 30%). This
may be due to the complex schema of TNM staging. Stage
IIIB is the most easily recognizable form of locally advanced
breast cancer, and is defined by the presence of chest wall
involvement, skin involvement, or inflammatory breast
cancer. These clinical characteristics are clear indications
for NAC. Stage IIIA disease (those cases included in
NCCN group 3 in the current study) and stage IIIC are
determined by the presence of more advanced lymph node
disease. In some of these patients, the burden of lymph
node disease may have been underappreciated. However, it

also may be that physicians associate these stages of disease
less frequently with the need for neoadjuvant therapy. It is
encouraging to note that the use of NAC has increased substantially among patients with stage IIIA and IIIC disease
in recent years, although it still remains surprisingly low.
More African American patients received NAC compared with other races. Medicaid and uninsured populations also had higher rates of NAC use. This may reflect the
relatively higher rates of more advanced cancers diagnosed
in these patient populations due to underuse of mammographic screening20 and the higher incidence of more biologically aggressive and triple-negative breast cancers
observed in African American women.21-23 Use of NAC
was also more common in younger women, possibly driven
by more biologically aggressive cancers in younger patients,
and potentially their desire for breast conservation.
We also observed significant regional variation in
the use of NAC in the overall sample at large. The highest
rates of NAC use in the West South Central region, Pacific region, and New England may be due to a combination of factors. There are known regional variations in
screening mammogram availability and use24 that may
influence stage distribution at diagnosis, and regions also
vary by the percentage of the population that is uninsured.
However, regional differences in NAC use even in
patients with the most locally advanced tumors persisted
even after adjusting for these confounding variables,
which suggests additional contributors. We speculate that
the influence and practice patterns of large regional academic cancer centers may have a substantial impact on
community practice in the vicinity of these institutions.
Although the use of NAC is generally higher in academic
centers compared with community sites, some academic
institutions have stronger traditions and a broader use of
preoperative therapy in clinical trials and as routine care
than others.
A strength of the current analysis is that the NCDB
affords the opportunity to analyze treatment patterns
among large numbers of patients, in routine clinical practice, across a wide range of treatment settings and geographic regions that could reveal practice patterns not

apparent from a single-institution case series or clinical
trial. However, the size and nature of the NCDB pose
limitations related to the type and availability of data, nor
do we have data available regarding the reason why NAC
was not administered. The database has substantial missing data concerning hormone receptor status (missing in
12.6% of cases) and HER2 status, and no information is
available regarding what specific drugs were administered.
The data are based on coding done by certified tumor
registrars extracted from routine medical records at participating institutions. The NCDB also lags several years
behind due to the extent and complexity of data entry.
The availability of highly effective preoperative treatment
regimens for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer
through the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab,
and chemotherapy likely have increased NAC use further
since 2011.
The results of the current study have demonstrated
that the use of NAC increased between 2003 and 2011.
Even in patients with locally advanced breast cancer,
NAC appears to be underused, because <50% of all
patients with stage III cancer were treated with preoperative chemotherapy. Given the plethora of data regarding
the advantages of NAC, the NCCN recommendations,
and newer targeted therapies and clinical trials that are
only offered in the neoadjuvant setting, these data demonstrate the need for more physicians to consider NAC,
especially in their patients with stage III disease.
