ABSTRACT
Triptolide, an active compound extracted from the Chinese herb thunder god vine
(Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.), has potent anti-tumor activity. Recently, triptolide
was found to induce autophagy in cancer cells. However, the effects of triptolide on
autophagy in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells have not yet been clearly elucidated.
In this study, we demonstrated that triptolide induces autophagy in three PCa cell lines,
PC-3, LNCaP and C4–2. Furthermore, we found that triptolide mediates intracellular
accumulation of free calcium by stimulating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
response. This activates the CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway, which in turn inhibits
mTOR and activates both ULK1 and Beclin 1, finally resulting in autophagy. Moreover,
we found that treatment with autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and
chloroquine (CQ) enhances triptolide-induced PCa cell death and growth inhibition.
Using a PC-3-xenografted mouse model, we showed that blocking autophagy with
CQ significantly promoted triptolide-induced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Overall,
our results show that triptolide induces protective autophagy through the CaMKKβAMPK pathway in PCa cells, implying that a combination of triptolide with autophagy
inhibitors may potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy for PCa.

INTRODUCTION

demonstrated that triptolide has effective anti-PCa and antilaryngocarcinoma activity [5, 6]. Triptolide also exhibits very
high anti-tumor activity. Titov et al. reported that triptolide
inhibits the proliferation of all 60 cancer cell lines from the
US National Cancer Institute with an average IC50 of just
12 nM [7].
The anti-tumor effect of triptolide is mainly due to
its induction of cancer cell death. As the major cause of cell
death, triptolide-induced apoptosis has been well studied.
It has been proven that triptolide-induced apoptosis in
cancer cells shows typical apoptotic characteristics, such
as nuclear fragmentation, DNA damage, cytochrome C
release, caspase activation, PARP1 cleavage, and changes
in the expression of apoptotic proteins [1]. In addition
to the apoptosis induction effect, recent studies showed
that triptolide also shows anti-tumor effect on pancreatic
cancer and neuroblastoma cells through induction of
autophagy [8, 9]. However, the mechanism that underlies

Triptolide, a diterpene triepoxide, is the major active
compound extracted from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb
named thunder god vine (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.),
which is mainly used to treat autoimmune diseases
including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus.
Beyond the immunosuppression effect, triptolide shows
many other pharmacological activities, such as reduction
of inflammation, contraceptive activity, decreased cyst
formation, and so on [1]. Triptolide also shows potent antitumor effects, which has attracted much attention and has
been studied intensively. Many studies have demonstrated
that triptolide has broad-spectrum anti-tumor efficacy.
Triptolide shows anti-tumor effects on almost all kinds of
cancer cell in vitro and in vivo, including breast cancer,
lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, thyroid
cancer, leukemia, and so on [1–4]. Our previous studies

RESULTS

the induction of autophagy by triptolide is still unclear,
especially in PCa.
Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic
mechanism in eukaryotes through which intracellular
contents including large protein complexes and
dysfunctional organelles are packaged and transported
to lysosomes for degradation and re-use [10]. Three
forms of autophagy are commonly referred to, namely
macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperonemediated autophagy, among which macroautophagy
(called autophagy in this paper) is the best understood [10].
As a basic catabolic mechanism, autophagy degrades
and recycles unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular
components, thus maintaining intracellular homeostasis,
preventing cumulative cellular damage and cell aging,
and promoting the cellular survival response to nutrient
starvation and stresses [11]. Extensive autophagy may lead
to cell death which is defined as autophagic programmed
cell death (PCD) [10, 12]. Autophagy is also involved
in pathological processes including neurodegenerative
diseases, infection and cancer [13–15]. The role of
autophagy in cancer has drawn the most attention, because
it may provide a viable option for cancer therapy. Previous
research suggested that autophagy acts as a double-edged
sword in cancer survival by playing opposing roles of
protector and inhibitor according to the cancer type
or grade [12, 14, 16]. On the one hand, by maintaining
homeostasis, autophagy recycles cellular components and
promotes energy production to meet the high metabolic
demands of cancer cells, thus supporting cancer cell
survival. On the other hand, autophagy reduces cell
instability and damage to prevent tumorigenesis. Until
now, many anti-tumor compounds including triptolide
have been found to have an autophagy-inducing effect, in
spite of the fact that autophagy is associated with drug
resistance in some cases [17, 18].
In the present study, we investigated the autophagy
induction effect of triptolide on PCa cells, and examined
the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results
demonstrate that triptolide induces autophagy in PC-3,
LNCaP and C4–2 cells. Further studies showed that
triptolide activates the AMPK pathway, which in turn
inhibits mTOR and activates ULK1 and Beclin 1, thus
promoting autophagy. AMPK activation is mainly due
to CaMKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of AMPKα
Thr172 in response to accumulation of free calcium in
the cytoplasm. This calcium is released from the ER as
a result of triptolide-induced ER stress. Furthermore, we
found that autophagy plays a cytoprotective role in PCa
cells, defending the cells against triptolide cytotoxicity
in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our findings suggest that
triptolide induces protective autophagy in PCa cells
through the CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway. This
let us to anticipate that a combination of triptolide and
autophagy inhibitors may be a more effective therapeutic
strategy for treating prostate cancer.

Triptolide induces autophagy in PCa cells
To determine whether triptolide induces autophagy
in PCa cells, we used three human prostate cancer cell
lines, PC-3, LNCaP and C4–2, as models and treated with
triptolide. We first examined LC3B-II formation and the
level of p62 in PCa cells treated with triptolide. After
treatment with triptolide at the indicated concentration for
24 h (Figure 1A), or with 50 nM triptolide for the indicated
time (Figure 1B), LC3B-II levels were increased in PC-3,
LNCaP and C4–2 cells in both dose-dependent and timedependent manners. Meanwhile, the p62 level decreased
in similar manners. These results indicate that triptolide
may induce autophagy in PCa cells. We also monitored the
formation of autophagosomes in these PCa cell lines stably
transfected with tandem mCherry-Wassabi-LC3B. In these
cells, early autophagosomes display both green signal
(Wassabi) and red signal (mCherry). Autophagolysosome
display only red fluorescence since the Wassabi signal
is sensitive to the acidic conditions in the lysosome
lumen while the mCherry signal is more stable. After
cells treatment with triptolide, autophagosomes were
detected by confocal microscopy. The number of yellow
puncta (both green and red positive, G+R+) and red
only puncta (G−R+) increased significantly in cells
treated with 50 nM triptolide compared with untreated
control cells (Figure 1C). Furthermore, more autophagic
vesicles containing engulfed organelles were detected by
transmission electron microscopy in triptolide-treated cells
(Figure 1D). These results prove that triptolide induces
autophagy in PCa cells.
Since autophagy is a dynamic and multi-step
process, we continued to monitor the autophagic flux
induced by triptolide (50 nM). As shown in Figure 2A,
knockdown of ATG5 by siRNA decreased triptolideinduced LC3B-II formation in PC-3 cells, but showed
no obvious effect on LC3B-II formation in LNCaP and
C4–2 cells. This suggests that triptolide may induce
autophagy in LNCaP and C4–2 cells in an ATG5independent manner. Knockdown of ATG7 by siRNAs
decreased triptolide-induced LC3B-II formation in all
three cell lines (Figure 2B). Meanwhile, we performed
similar experiments in the presence of the autophagy
inhibitors 3-MA and CQ. 3-MA is a class III PI3kinase inhibitor that blocks autophagy at an upstream
step to decrease the production of LC3B-II. CQ is
a lysosomotropic agent which prevents endosomal
acidification, thus inhibiting lysosomal enzymes and
causing accumulation of LC3B-II. The results showed
that 3-MA (10 mM) reduced triptolide-induced LC3B-II
formation in PCa cells (Figure  2C), while CQ (3  μM)
increased LC3B-II accumulation (Figure 2D). We
also examined the effect of knockdown of ATG5/7 or
autophagy inhibitors on triptolide-induced LC3B puncta

formation in PC-3 cells using confocal microscopy. As
shown in Figure 2E and 2F, knockdown of ATG5 and
ATG7 both decreased triptolide-induced LC3B puncta
formation (Figure 2E). 3-MA reduced the number of
both yellow spots (autophagosomes) and red spots
(autophagolysosomes), indicating that 3-MA inhibited
triptolide-induced autophagosome formation (Figure 2F).
CQ increased the number of yellow spots and reduced
the number of red spots, indicating that CQ induced
accumulation of autophagosomes while reducing the
formation of autophagolysosomes (Figure 2F). Overall,
these data further confirm that triptolide induces autophagy
in PCa cells.

ULK1 was decreased by triptolide in three PCa cell lines,
as was the level of P-ULK1 Ser757 (Figure 3B). This
indicates that the inhibitory effect of mTOR on ULK1
is suppressed by triptolide, which is consistent with the
effect of triptolide on mTOR in PC-3 cells. Furthermore,
triptolide increased the level of P-ULK1 Ser317 in three
PCa cell lines (Figure 3B), indicating that triptolide
may promote phosphorylation of ULK1 by AMPK, thus
activating the ULK1 complex. We also examined the
effect of triptolide on Beclin 1, an important component
of the class III PI3K complex. Activation of Beclin 1 is
dependent on phosphorylation at Ser93 and Ser96 by
AMPK. We found that although triptolide had different
effects on the level of Beclin 1 in three PCa cell lines,
it consistently increased the level of P-Beclin 1 Ser93/96
(Figure 3B). This indicates that triptolide also induces
activation of the class III PI3K complex.
To determine whether the autophagy induction
effect of triptolide is dependent on activation of the ULK1
complex and the class III PI3K complex, we knocked
down the expression of ULK1 or Beclin 1 in PC-3 and
LNCaP cells with specific siRNAs and examined the
level of LC3B-II in the presence or absence of triptolide
(50 nM). We found that knockdown of ULK1 (Figure 3C)
or Beclin 1 (Figure 3D) reduced the triptolide-induced
enhancement of LC3B-II levels. We also used PC-3 cells
stably transfected with tandem mCherry-Wassabi-LC3B
to investigate the effect of ULK1 or Beclin 1 knockdown
on the number of LC3B puncta. Our results showed that
knockdown of ULK1 or Beclin 1 decreased the number
of LC3B puncta in triptolide-treated cells (Figure 3E).
Together, these results demonstrate that triptolide-induced
autophagy in PCa cells is dependent on activation of the
ULK1 complex and the class III PI3K complex.

Triptolide induces autophagy by inhibiting the
mTORC1 complex and activating both the ULK
complex and the class III PI3K complex in PCa
cells
We further examined the molecular mechanism
underlying triptolide-induced autophagy. Autophagy
is strictly regulated by multiple signaling pathways, in
which mTOR acts as a critical negative-regulator [19].
Therefore, we first examined the effect of triptolide on
the mTORC1 complex. As shown in Figure 3A, triptolide
does not significantly affect the protein level of mTOR
in three PCa cell lines. However, the level of P-mTOR
Ser2448 was decreased by triptolide in PC-3 cells, but was
not significantly changed in LNCaP and C4–2 cells. This
implies that triptolide disrupts the activity of mTORC1
by directly suppressing the phosphorylation of mTOR at
Ser2448 in PC-3 cells. Moreover, we tested the effect of
triptolide on the regulatory associated protein of mTOR
(raptor), an important subunit of mTORC1. Raptor acts
as a binding partner of mTOR, and promotes the mTORmediated phosphorylation of p70S6k and 4E-BP1 [20].
Phosphorylation of raptor at Ser792 by AMPK induces
14–3–3 binding, which results in inhibition of mTOR
kinase activity and induction of autophagy [20–22].
Our results showed that triptolide increases the level of
P-raptor Ser792, but has different effects on total raptor
in all three PCa cell lines (Figure 3A). This suggests
that triptolide also indirectly inhibits mTOR activity by
promoting raptor phosphorylation in PCa cells, and further
implies that AMPK may be involved in triptolide-induced
autophagy.
The autophagy pathway is strictly regulated
by a series of ATG proteins, among which the ULK1
complex is essential for initiation of autophagy [23].
When nutrients are deficient, ULK1 is phosphorylated at
Ser317, Ser555, and Ser777 by activated AMPK, leading
to autophagy activation; in contrast, when nutrients are
sufficient, ULK1 is phosphorylated at Ser757 by mTOR,
leading to the disassociation of ULK1 and AMPK, which
inhibits autophagy [24]. We therefore monitored the effect
of triptolide on ULK1. We found that the protein level of

Triptolide induces autophagy by activating
AMPK in PCa cells
We found that triptolide enhanced the
phosphorylation level of several AMPK substrates
involved in autophagy activation, including P-raptor
Ser792, P-ULK1 Ser317 and P-Beclin 1 Ser93/96. This
implies that AMPK may be involved in the induction of
autophagy by triptolide in PCa cells. Thus, we investigated
the role of AMPK in triptolide-induced autophagy. As
shown in Figure 4A, triptolide had a different effect
on AMPK protein levels in three PCa cell lines, but
increased the level of P-AMPKα Thr172 in all of them.
This indicates that the AMPK pathway is activated by
triptolide in PCa cells. To examine whether AMPK is
involved in triptolide-induced autophagy, we inhibited
AMPK using AMPKα siRNA or a widely-used AMPK
inhibitor, compound C, in PC-3 cells. The results showed
that both siRNA and compound C (10 μM) suppressed the
triptolide (50 nM)-induced LC3B II increase (Figure 4B
and 4C) and LC3B puncta formation (Figure 4D and 4E).

AMPK promotes autophagy through multiple
pathways. AMPK directly phosphorylates ULK1 at
multiple sites and Beclin 1 at Ser93/96, leading to

autophagy initiation. AMPK phosphorylates TSC2
at Ser1387 and raptor at Ser792 to indirectly inhibit
mTOR kinase activity [25]. To examine how AMPK
acts in triptolide-induced autophagy, we determined the
levels of these phosphorylation substrates of AMPK in

investigate whether activation of CaMKKβ-AMPK by
triptolide is Ca2+-dependent, we monitored triptolideinduced AMPK activation and autophagy in cells
treated with a calcium chelating agent, BAPTA-AM.
Our results showed that chelation of cytoplasmic free
calcium by BAPTA-AM (10 μM) antagonized the level
of P-AMPKα Thr172 and formation of LC3B-II in the
presence of triptolide (50 nM) (Figure 5H). BAPTA-AM
also decreased the number of LC3B puncta induced by
triptolide in PC-3 cells (Figure 5I). These results indicate
that triptolide activates the CaMKKβ-AMPK pathway by
inducing accumulation of cytoplasmic free calcium.

Triptolide induces autophagy by activating the
CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway

Triptolide induces autophagy via ER
stress-dependent calcium release

We have demonstrated that AMPK activation is
important for the autophagy induction effect of triptolide.
Next, we wanted to determine the mechanism of triptolide
-induced AMPK activation. AMPK is activated by
elevation of the AMP: ATP ratio during stress-induced
energy deprivation, which is mainly mediated by a
serine/threonine kinase, LKB1 [26]. Therefore, we
firstly examined the effect of triptolide on LKB1. The
result showed that triptolide increased the level of both
LKB1 and P-AMPKα Thr172 (Figure  S1A). However,
knockdown of LKB1 with specific siRNAs had no effect
on the the level of P-AMPKα Thr172 or LC3B-II increased
by triptolide (Figure S1B). These results demonstrate
that LKB1 is not involved in triptolide-induced AMPK
activation and autophagy. We further investigated another
important AMPK regulator, CaMKKβ, which is a Ca2+/
calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase [40]. The
results showed that triptolide has no effect on the level of
CaMKKβ, but increased the level of P-AMPKα Thr172
(Figure  5A). Interestingly, knockdown of CaMKKβ
with specific siRNAs or disruption of CaMKKβ activity
with the specific inhibitor STO-609 (10 μM) reduced the
level of P-AMPKα Thr172 and the formation of LC3BII in the presence of triptolide (50 nM) (Figure 5B and
Figure 5C). Disrupting CaMKKβ activity also decreased
the number of LC3B puncta induced by triptolide in PC-3
cells (Figure 5D and 5E). These data demonstrate that
triptolide-induced AMPK phosphorylation and activation
occurs mainly through CaMKKβ.
It is well known that CaMKKβ is a Ca2+-dependent
kinase. The kinase activity of CaMKKβ is enhanced by
the accumulation of cytoplasmic free calcium [27, 28].
Although triptolide has no significant effect on the
CaMKKβ protein level, we reasoned that triptolide may
activate CaMKKβ by raising the cellular level of free
calcium. To confirm our hypothesis, we used a calciumspecific fluorescent probe, Fluo-4 AM, to measure the
free calcium concentration in PC-3 cells treated with
triptolide. The result showed that triptolide strongly
induces accumulation of cytoplasmic free calcium in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 5F and 5G). To further

ER stress is one of the signaling pathways involved
in regulation of calcium release [27, 29]. It has been
reported that triptolide can induce endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress in cancer cells [30].Thus we hypothesized that
triptolide induces ER stress, causing free calcium to be
released from the ER and to accumulate in the cytoplasm.
This in turn results in activation of the CaMKKβ-AMPK
signaling pathway and autophagy induction. To test our
hypothesis, we first examined whether triptolide induces
ER stress in PCa cells. As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, the
levels of ER stress bio-markers including PERK, IRE1α,
P-eIF2α, Ero1-L, calnexin and PDI, were increased by
triptolide in both dose-dependent and time-dependent
manners in PC-3 cells. Bip, a negative regulator of ER
stress, was decreased. Splicing of XBP1 RNA, which
encodes a downstream effector of IRE1α, was also
increased by triptolide treatment in PC-3 cells (Figure 6C
and 6D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that
triptolide induces ER stress through both the PERK-eIF2α
arm and the IRE1α-XBP1 arm in PCa cells.
To investigate whether the calcium accumulation
results from triptolide-induced ER stress, we treated PC-3
cells with two specific ER stress inhibitors, 4-phenyl
butyric acid (4-PBA) and Tauroursodeoxycholic acid
(TUDCA). The results showed that inhibition of ER
stress by 4-PBA (1 mM) or TUDCA (0.5 mM) strongly
inhibited triptolide (50 nM)-induced intracellular calcium
accumulation (Figure 6E and 6F). This demonstrates that
the accumulation of cytoplasmic free calcium is stimulated
by triptolide-induced ER stress in PCa cells. Furthermore,
4-PBA and TUDCA antagonized the level of P-AMPKα
Thr172 and formation of autophagosomes (Figure 6G
and  6H). Overexpression of AMPKα1 or CaMKKβ
rescued TUDCA-antagonized LC3B-II formation with
50 nM triptolide-treament (Figure S2A and S2B).
Together, these results indicate that triptolide-induced ER
stress results in calcium release, leading to CaMKKβ–
AMPK pathway activation and autophagy induction in
PCa cells.

Triptolide induces cytoprotective autophagy in
PCa cells

several other studies have also reported that triptolide
induces autophagy in pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and
neuroblastoma cells [8, 9, 32]. These findings suggest that
induction of autophagy may be a general consequence of
triptolide activity.
The serine/threonine kinase mTOR acts as a negative
gatekeeper in autophagy regulation. When nutrients are
sufficient, the PI3K/Akt pathway activates mTOR through
phosphorylation at Ser2448. The activated mTOR inhibits
autophagy by phosphorylating and inactivating Atg13
and ULK1, two subunits of the ULK1 complex which are
essential for the autophagy initiation progress [23, 33].
During nutrient starvation and stress, the activity of mTOR
is inhibited, leading to autophagy induction. Compounds
that induce autophagy can be broadly classified into two
groups: those that signal via the mTOR pathway (mTORdependent), and those that do not (mTOR-independent).
For example, rapamycin and its analogs (CCI-779,
RAD001, and AP23573) are potent mTOR-dependent
inducers of autophagy [34]. They act by stabilizing the
raptor-mTOR association by forming a complex with
FKBP12, thereby inhibiting the kinase activity of mTOR.
Conversely, lithium and L-690, 330 have been reported to
induce autophagy by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase
rather than by decreasing the kinase activity of mTOR
[35, 36]. Our findings showed that triptolide suppresses the
level of P-mTOR Ser2448 in PC-3 cells, but has no effect
in LNCaP and C4–2 cells. Meanwhile, triptolide increases
the level of P-raptor Ser792 in three PCa cell lines.
P-raptor Ser792 mediates 14–3–3 binding with mTOR
to inhibit mTOR kinase activity. These data suggest that
triptolide induces mTOR-dependent autophagy in PC-3
cells, and that triptolide inhibits mTOR activity through
direct and indirect mechanisms in these cells.
AMPK acts as an important sensor of intracellular
energy levels and is activated in response to metabolic
stress to mediate energy balance. Autophagy is one
of main mechanisms regulated by AMPK. Our study
showed that the AMPK pathway is involved in triptolideinduced autophagy in PCa cells. Triptolide activates
AMPK by up-regulating the level of P-AMPKα Thr172,
which in turn phosphorylates and activates its substrates,
including TSC2, raptor, ULK1 and Beclin 1. This leads to
suppression of the negative regulatory effect of mTOR on
autophagy and activation of the ULK1 complex and the
class III PI3K complex, finally resulting in initiation of
autophagy.
AMPK activity is strictly regulated in the cell.
The serine/threonine kinase LKB1, a known tumor
suppressor, is a key upstream activator of AMPK and
phosphorylates AMPK at Thr172 under energy stress
conditions [37–39]. Several drugs have been found to
induce autophagy through the LKB1-AMPK signaling
pathway [40–42]. However, our study showed that
LKB1 is not involved in triptolide-induced AMPK
activation. Although triptolide enhanced the level of

Since autophagy has dual roles in cancer cell
survival and cell death, we next investigated the effect of
autophagy on the anti-PCa activity of triptolide in PC-3
and LNCaP cells. Firstly we inhibited the triptolideinduced autophagy with 3-MA (10 mM) or CQ (3 μM)
and measured triptolide (50 nM)-induced apoptosis by
monitoring the level of cleavage of the apoptosis-related
proteins caspase-3 and PARP. The results showed that
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was enhanced in cells
co-treated with autophagy inhibitors (3-MA or CQ) and
triptolide (Figure 7A and 7B). Furthermore, we examined
cell viability to evaluate the effect of autophagy on the cell
growth inhibition activity of triptolide (50 nM). The data
showed that inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA (10 mM)
or CQ (3 μM) enhanced the anti-tumor effect of triptolide
(Figure 7C and 7D).
We also tested the effects of autophagy on the
anti-PCa activity of triptolide in vivo. Nude mice with
PC-3 cells tumor xenografts were continuously injected
intraperitoneally with PBS, triptolide (0.15 mg/kg/2 days),
CQ (50 mg/kg/2 days), and combination of triptolide with
CQ until study termination. After the administration of the
treatment for 18 days, combined treatment with triptolide
and CQ significantly reduced the tumor volume and tumor
weight, compared to vehicle treated group and triptolide
treated group (Figure 7E and 7F). Meanwhile, the results
of immunochemistry assay suggested that the combined
treatment increased the level of LC3B and cleaved
caspase-3 while reduced Ki-67 expression (Figure 7G).
These data suggested that autophagy inhibition also
enhanced the cytotoxicity of triptolide in PC-3 cells
in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that autophagy
protects PCa cells from triptolide-induced cell death.

DISCUSSION
Triptolide, the major active ingredient of
Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F., has been shown to have
potent anti-tumor activity. Apoptosis was found to be the
major mechanism by which triptolide induces cell death
[5, 6, 31]. In this study, we demonstrated that triptolide
also induces autophagy in human prostate cancer
cells. Our results suggested that triptolide stimulates
the formation of LC3B-II and increases the number of
LC3B-II-positive puncta in three PCa cell lines, PC-3,
LNCaP and C4–2. We further found that the triptolideinduced autophagic flux is disrupted by knocking down
ATG7, or by using the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and
CQ. Interestingly, blocking the expression of ATG5
significantly inhibited triptolide-induced autophagy in
PC-3 cells but not in LNCaP and C4–2 cells. These results
imply that triptolide may induce autophagy in LNCaP and
C4–2 cells in an ATG5-independent manner. In addition,

LKB1, knockdown of LKB1 had no effect on the level
of P-AMPK Thr172 or LC3B-II following triptolide
treatment. Thus, triptolide induced LKB1 accumulation
may contribute to the anti-PCa activity of triptolide, but
not to the autophagy induction effect. In contrast, we
found that CaMKKβ is the key upstream regulator of
AMPK following triptolide treatment. CaMKKβ can
activate AMPK by phosphorylating Thr172 in response to
cellular calcium signaling [28]. In this study, we found
that blocking CaMKKβ activity reduces triptolide-induced
autophagy and AMPK phosphorylation, which indicates
that triptolide induces autophagy through the CaMKKβAMPK signaling pathway.
CaMKKβ is a calcium-dependent kinase and its
activity is mediated by cellular calcium signaling [28].
In our study, we found that triptolide treatment
greatly increased the level of cytoplasmic calcium,
which subsequently activated CaMKKβ. Chelation of
cytoplasmic free calcium by BAPTA-AM antagonized the
triptolide-induced activation of CaMKKβ and induction
of autophagy. Krosch et al. also reported that triptolideinduced autophagic cell death in the neuroblastoma

cell line SH-SY5Y was accompanied by an increase in
intracellular calcium [9]. These findings suggest that the
calcium level attributes to triptolide-induced autophagy.
As we know, the concentration of cytoplasmic free
calcium usually remains very low. In response to certain
stimuli, the cytoplasmic calcium level can increase
sharply by release from the ER or transport from the
extracellular environment [29, 43, 44]. Our data showed
that triptolide induces ER stress in PCa cells, and the ER
stress inhibitors significantly inhibit the accumulation
of cytoplasmic calcium and activation of the CaMKKβAMPK signaling pathway in the presence of triptolide.
These data demonstrate that the accumulation of
cytoplasmic calcium can be mainly attributed to
triptolide-induced ER stress. Meanwhile, we found that
suppression of ER stress with inhibitors greatly reduced
triptolide-induced autophagy. These results indicate that
ER stress is critical for triptolide-induced autophagy. It
will be worth further examining the relationship between
ER stress and triptolide-induced autophagy to investigate
whether other mechanisms are involved besides calcium
signaling.

Figure 8: Schematic diagram of hypothetical mechanisms underlying induction of autophagy by triptolide in PCa cells.
Triptolide induces ER stress, which causes calcium to be released from the ER into the cytoplasm. The high cellular calcium level stimulates
CaMKKβ to phosphorylate AMPKα at Thr172. Activated AMPK inhibits mTOR activity through activation of TSC2 and raptor. Inactive
mTOR no longer suppresses the ULK1 complex. Activated AMPK also directly phosphorylates ULK1 and Beclin 1, resulting in activation
of the ULK1 complex and the Beclin1-VPS34-ATG14L complex. Activation of these complexes leads to the induction of autophagosome
formation. Inhibition of autophagy with autophagy inhibitors 3-MA or CQ enhances triptolide-induced cell death in PCa cells.

Autophagy plays two opposing roles of protector or
inhibitor in cell proliferation progress. Our results show
that inhibition of autophagy enhances the cytotoxicity
and anti-tumor effect of triptolide both in vitro and in
vivo, indicating that triptolide induces cytoprotective
autophagy in PCa cells. Recently, it was also reported
that autophagy can protect rat cardiomyocytes against
triptolide cytotoxicity by preventing apoptosis [45].
However, triptolide was found to induce autophagic death
in the metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines S2–013, S2VP10 and Hs766T, as well as lung cancer cells A549 and
neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y [8, 9, 32]. These findings
indicate that the effect of autophagy on the anti-apoptosis
activity of triptolide is dependent on the cell type.
In conclusion, based on our study, we propose that
triptolide induces ER stress, leading to calcium release
from the ER. The high cellular calcium level activates
CaMKKβ-AMPK signaling pathway, which subsequently
induces cytoprotective autophagy in PCa cells (Figure 8).
Meanwhile, inhibition of autophagy enhances the antiPCa effect of triptolide. Thus, we predict that combination
treatment with triptolide and pharmacological autophagy
inhibitors will be an effective therapeutic strategy for
prostate cancer.
