Abstract
Resistance to platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy remains a major clinical impediment to effective
management of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). To gain insights into resistance mechanisms, we compared gene
and confirmed expression patterns of novel EOC cell lines selected for paclitaxel and carboplatin resistance.
Here, we report that resistance can be conferred by downregulation of the Polo-like kinase Plk2. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that downregulation occurred at the level of transcription via associated DNA
methylation of the CpG island in the Plk2 gene promoter in cell lines, primary tumors, and patient sera.
Inhibitory RNA (RNAi)-mediated knockdown and ectopic overexpression established a critical functional role for
Plk2 in determining apoptotic sensitivity to paclitaxel and carboplatin. In drug-resistant human EOC cell lines,
Plk2 promoter methylation varied with the degree of drug resistance and transcriptional silencing of the
promoter. RNAi-dependent knockdown of Plk2 abrogated G2-M cell-cycle blockade by paclitaxel, conferring
resistance to both paclitaxel and platinum. Conversely, ectopic expression of Plk2 restored sensitivity to G2-M
cell-cycle blockade and cytotoxicity triggered by paclitaxel. In clinical cases, DNA methylation of the Plk2 CpG
island in tumor tissue was associated with a higher risk of relapse in patients treated postoperatively with
carboplatin and paclitaxel (P ¼ 0.003). This trend was also reflected in the analysis of matched serum samples.
Taken together, our results implicate Plk2 as a clinically important determinant of chemosensitivity,
in support of the candidacy of Plk2 as a theranostic marker to inform EOC management. Cancer Res; 71(9);

Introduction
The Polo-like kinases (Plk) are a family of serine-threonine
kinases involved in cell-cycle regulation and cellular
response to stresses, for example, DNA damage. Plk1 is
the best characterized kinase and positively regulates progression through G2 (1). Polo-like kinase 2/Snk (Plk2) and
Polo-like kinase 3 Plk3/Fnk/Prk (Plk3) were identified as

immediate-early transcripts in mouse fibroblasts (2–4),
whereas Plk4 (SAK) functions in centriole biogenesis
(5–9). Plk1 is overexpressed in various cancers supporting
treatment strategies designed to target it (10, 11). It has a
role in development and is required for centriole duplication
(12, 13), although Plk2/ mice are viable (14). Plk2 induces
apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells (15), and its
expression is directly induced by wild-type p53 (16). Under
normal physiologic conditions, Plk2 protein is subject to
proteosomal degradation via the ubiquitin ligase hVPS18
(17). Methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing of
Plk2 is common in BL (15). Transcriptional silencing of
many genes is described for epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC; ref. 18).
EOC is often a chronic disease, characterized by longterm responsiveness to chemotherapy. Cisplatin and carboplatin are key agents in EOC management and cancers
may retain sensitivity to these drugs for prolonged periods
and, sometimes, even after clinical relapse. Paclitaxel
(Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) are frequently used in
combination with platinum for treating EOC. There is
emerging evidence that epigenetic changes contribute significantly to acquired chemotherapy resistance (19–21). We
show, herein, that Plk2 is a determinant of sensitivity to
paclitaxel and platinum.

Materials and Methods
Drugs used
Carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, 50 -azacytidine, and trichostatin A were obtained from Sigma Aldrich.
Cell lines and plasmids
Primary normal ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSE) were
prepared as described (22). A2780 cells were obtained from
European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC). SKOV-3 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;
LGC Promochem). Cell lines were authenticated at source by
short tandem repeat profiling, morphology (ATCC), and DNA
profiling (ECACC). Sublines of A2780 and SKOV-3 ovarian
carcinoma cell lines with acquired resistance to paclitaxel and
carboplatin (SKOV-3TaxR and SKOV-3CR, respectively) were
derived by sequential, pulsed exposure to increasing concentrations of drug. Maintenance doses for the drug-resistant cell
lines were generally sub-IC50 doses and representative of
clinically achievable levels.
Transfection (knock-in) and silencing
(knockdown) of Plk2
Stable knockdown was achieved using plasmid-based
inhibitory RNA (RNAi). Sequences (from Ambion) were
ligated into pSilencer. A2780 cells were transfected with
pSilencer plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and
selected in hygromycin B. Cells were then challenged with
paclitaxel and subjected to flow cytometry. The plasmid for
ectopic expression of Plk2 was described previously (15). For
transient, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Plk2, we used
reagents provided by SMARTpool (Dharmacon; ThermoScientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following 72 hours of silencing, SKOV-3 cells were subcultured into
T252 tissue culture flasks at approximately 30% to 50%
confluence and exposed to paclitaxel (10 nmol/L) or carboplatin (100 mmol/L; both used at approximately twice the
IC50 dose) for a period of 48 hours, harvested, and then
subjected to the Annexin assay.
Clinical samples
Samples of EOC were obtained from the Tissue Bank of
the Charite Hospital, Berlin, Germany. Tissues obtained at
initial debulking surgery and at first relapse (obtained with
informed consent and local ethical committee approval)
were collected as snap-frozen biopsies at surgery. Serum
was collected at the time of diagnosis and relapse and stored
at 80 C. Genomic DNA was obtained from tissues using
proteinase K/phenol and from serum using the Qiagen
system. Cases were predominantly serous adenocarcinomas
(n ¼ 43) but also included endometrioid carcinomas (n ¼ 5),
mucinous (n ¼ 1), clear cell (n ¼ 1), mixed histology (n ¼ 2),
and 2 unclassified cases (Supplementary Table S2). Postoperative chemotherapy comprised carboplatin and paclitaxel for all patients, given on either a 21-day (q21) or 7-day
(q7) schedule. In some cases, gemcitabine was added.
Response was assessed by standard criteria including clin-

ical examination, serum CA125, and computerized tomographic (CT) imaging.
mRNA analysis
Analysis of Plk2 expression by reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was as described
previously (15).
Methylation analysis
Genomic DNA was purified from cell pellets by proteinase K
digestion and from serum, using a commercially available
system (Qiagen). For methylation analysis, genomic DNA
(1 mg) was modified by sodium bisulfite as described previously (15). The location of primers for bisulfite sequencing
and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Quantitative MSP (qMSP) of the Plk2 CpG
island was carried out using primer pair 4. PCR was conducted
in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection system (Applied
Biosystems) using SYBRGreen (Qiagen).
Western blotting
Cell pellets were prepared from attached and floating cell
populations, subjected to osmotic rupture in hypotonic detergent-based buffer (1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride,
NaVO4, aprotinin, and leupeptin as protease inhibitors, 150
mmol/L NaCl, in 50 mmol/L Tris buffer, 0.2% SDS, and 1% NP40, pH 7.5), and then 40 to 50 mg of protein per sample
electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibody-Plk2 antibody
(sc-25421, H-90 rabbit polyclonal antibody; Insight Biotechnology) or Plk1, 3, and 4 (AbCam). In some experiments, the
anti-Plk2 antibody used was as described previously (13, 15).
Following the probing of each membrane with the primary
antibody of choice, the membrane was stripped and
reprobed using a glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), or actin
antibody as a loading control. Antibodies against Plk1, Plk3,
and Plk4 were from AbCam.
Cytotoxicity assays
A2780 and SKOV-3 parental and resistant cells for cytotoxicity testing were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
3  104 to 4  104 cells/mL to allow approximately 3
doublings (approximately 10- to 20-fold increase in control
cell number) for the duration of the drug exposure. Cells were
allowed to attach and equilibrate for 24 hours and then
treated with various concentrations of drug more than 2 to
3 log orders of concentration. Results were not materially
affected by initial plating densities. Drugs were diluted in
tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum.
Control cell wells were treated with drug-free tissue culture
medium. Drug-treated cells were then returned to the incubator for a period of 72 hours. Cell viability was determined by
addition of 0.1 mg MTT to each well for 4 hours at 37 C. Wells
were aspirated to remove the medium, the resulting formazan crystals were solubilized in 200 mL dimethyl sulfoxide,
and the absorbance was read at 570 nm. The absorbance of
the formazan product obtained for drug-treated cells was

calculated as a fraction of that for the untreated control wells.
Growth curves were constructed by using PRISM software
and results expressed as IC50 values, that is, dose of drug
causing a 50% reduction in cell viability.
Annexin V assay for assessment of apoptosis
The effect of drugs on cell-cycle distribution was assessed
by flow cytometry as described previously (15). Cell death
was assessed by measurement of apoptosis by using
Annexin V. Briefly, cells were seeded into tissue culture
flasks to give a density approximately 30% to 50% confluence
(for SKOV-3 and A2780 cell lines, this corresponded to
4  105 cells/T25 flask), allowed to attach for 2 to 3 hours,
and then treated for 48 hours with the appropriate compound at various concentrations. In our hands, initial plating
densities between 20% and 50% did not significantly affect
apoptosis induction in this assay. An Annexin V–FITC
(fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated apoptosis detection
kit incorporating propidium iodide (PI) was used according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Oncogene; supplied by CN
Biosciences). Harvesting of cells included collection of
attached cells (following trypsinization) and floating cells.
Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, using the FL1
(FITC) and FL3 (PI) laser lines, and each sample was
assessed by using a collection of 10,000 events. All analyses
were carried out in triplicate.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version 14)
and Minitab programs. Tissue and serum methylation results
were assessed in the groups of responders and nonresponders
in terms of the utility of DNA methylation as a potential
marker of chemoresponsiveness.

Results
Ovarian carcinoma cell lines with primary resistance
to paclitaxel show cross-resistance to platinum
and vice versa
We derived, de novo, a series of novel A2780 EOC cell lines
with increasing degrees of acquired resistance to paclitaxel
(Supplementary Table S1). Calculating the relative resistance
(as a resistance factor) by using the ratio of IC50-resistant
variant/IC50 of parental cell line (1.5 nmol/L), we derived the
nomenclature for the A2780TaxR panel of cell lines; hence,
A2780TaxR354 is 354-fold resistant to paclitaxel. We also
developed independent SKOV-3 cell lines with primary
resistance to paclitaxel and carboplatin; SKOV-3TaxR was
52-fold resistant compared with the parental SKOV-3 cell
line (IC50 ¼ 5.7 nmol/L) and SKOV-3CR cell lines were 3-fold
resistant to carboplatin (IC50 ¼ 298.0 mmol/L) and 2-fold
resistant to cisplatin (IC50 ¼ 21.7 mmol/L; Supplementary
Table S1). We tested whether cell lines with acquired resistance to paclitaxel were cross-resistant to platinum compounds and vice versa. Paclitaxel-resistant cell lines were
challenged with carboplatin or cisplatin, and cytotoxicity
was evaluated. In each cell line in our series, paclitaxelresistant cell lines showed decreased sensitivity to cisplatin

www.aacrjournals.org

and carboplatin (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, SKOV-3CR cells showed decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S1).
Drug resistance is associated with loss of
G2-M checkpoint
Using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry, we asked
whether resistance to paclitaxel was associated with
changes in drug-induced apoptosis and/or cell-cycle distribution. In A2780TaxR354 paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, there
was a significant reduction in apoptosis on exposure to
paclitaxel relative to parental cells (Fig. 2A). The apoptotic
effects of drug treatment could be seen by the emergence of
Annexin V–positive (quadrants top right and bottom right)
and PI-positive populations (emergence toward top left/
right quadrants). Summation of the apoptotic quadrants
revealed approximately 49% and 25% cell death for A2780
parent and A2780TaxR354 cells, respectively, following treatment with paclitaxel. Likewise, following treatment with
cisplatin, a clear reduction in the extent of cell death is
also seen by comparing A2780 parent and A2780TaxR354–
resistant cells. Next, we analyzed perturbations in cell cycle
following drug exposure. Following 24-hour paclitaxel exposure, A2780 parent cells, sub-G1 (apoptotic)- and G2-M–
arrested populations were clearly increased (Fig. 2B), but
in paclitaxel-resistant A2780TaxR354 cells, there was no
increase in the sub-G1 population. Furthermore, the G2-M
population was greatly reduced in A2780TaxR354 cells relative to A2780 parental cells (Fig. 2B). Together, these results
imply that acquired resistance to paclitaxel involves loss of
G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint function and abrogation of apoptosis. In SKOV-3 parent cells, paclitaxel exposure resulted in
clear increase in the apoptotic cell population which was
completely absent in SKOV-3TaxR cells (Fig. 2C). In carboplatin-resistant SKOV-3CR cells, there was reduced apoptosis on exposure to paclitaxel (Fig. 2C).
Transcriptional silencing of Plk2 in cell lines with
acquired drug resistance
Next, we analyzed the expression and regulation of Plk2.
Plk2 mRNA was abundantly expressed in normal OSE and in
the parent A2780 and SKOV-3 lines (Fig. 3A and B). There was,
however, downregulation of Plk2 mRNA in A2780TaxR354,
SKOV-3TaxR (paclitaxel-resistant), and SKOV-3CR (carboplatin-resistant) cells relative to the respective parent lines
(Fig. 3A and B). Western blot analysis confirmed reduced
levels of Plk2 protein in paclitaxel-resistant A2780 and SKOV-3
cell lines (Fig. 3C). In contrast, there was no change in
expression of Plk1 or Plk3 between parent and paclitaxelresistant A2780 and SKOV-3 cell lines (Fig. 3D). Plk4 levels
were higher in A2780TaxR354 cells but not in SKOV-3TaxR. To
investigate whether downregulation of Plk2 mRNA is associated with methylation changes, we carried out bisulfite
sequencing of the Plk2 CpG island. The CpG island was
unmethylated in OSE, in the parent A2780 and SKOV-3
EOC cell lines, and in other EOC cell lines. However, in
A2780TaxR354 and SKOV-3TaxR cells, there was acquisition
of methylation within a defined region of the CpG island

(Fig. 4A). We tested whether demethylating agents reactivate
expression of Plk2 mRNA and observed an increase in Plk2
mRNA after exposure to 50 -aza-cytidine (aza-C; Fig. 4B), consistent with methylation-dependent silencing. Using both
conventional MSP and qMSP, we confirmed that methylation
was detectable in the paclitaxel-resistant derivatives
A2780TaxR354 and SKOV-3TaxR but not in the respective
parent cell lines (Fig. 4C and D).
Methylation and expression of Plk2 vary quantitatively
with drug resistance
We analyzed expression and methylation of Plk2 in our panel
of paclitaxel-resistant variants of A2780. Bisulfite sequencing
showed a progressive, quantitative increase in methylation
with increasing drug resistance (Fig. 5A). qMSP analysis confirmed that methylation increased with increasing paclitaxel
resistance (Fig. 5B). Expression of Plk2 mRNA (Fig. 5C) and

3320

protein (Fig. 5D) decreased with increasing paclitaxel resistance, consistent with changes in CpG methylation.
Paclitaxel resistance correlates with epigenetic status of
the Plk2 CpG island
We next tested the stability of the drug-resistant phenotype.
Clones of the A2780 paclitaxel-resistant cell line panel, with
increasing levels of primary resistance to paclitaxel, were
transferred to drug-free medium and grown continuously in
the absence of paclitaxel. After 6-week growth in drug-free
medium, A2780TaxR354 cells grown in the absence of paclitaxel () had substantially reverted to a paclitaxel-sensitive
phenotype (Fig. 6A). In A2780TaxR615 () cells, there was a
clear, but less complete, restoration of the paclitaxel-induced
G2-M block (Fig. 6A). Plk2 expression in A2780TaxR354 () had
returned to almost 75% of the level of parental cells and that of
A2780TaxR615 () to approximately 33% of parent A2780 cells

subjected to flow cytometry (data shown are representative of repeat experiments).

(Fig. 6B, light gray panels) but remained suppressed in cells
exposed to maintenance paclitaxel (dark gray panels). MSP
analysis of the Plk2 CpG island showed a decrease in methylation with recovery of Plk2 expression (Fig. 6C), and this was
confirmed by bisulfite sequencing of the Plk2 CpG island
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Plk2 expression modulates cytotoxicity of carboplatin
and paclitaxel
We used plasmid-mediated RNAi to stably downregulate
Plk2 in the drug-sensitive A2780 parent cell line. Knockdown
was confirmed by RT-PCR ("KD" in Fig. 7A). Clonal cell lines
with "knocked down" expression of Plk2 (A2780KD) were
challenged with a cytotoxic concentration of paclitaxel
(Fig. 7B). G2-M block and increase in the sub-G1 population
were greatly reduced in the knocked down cells (Fig. 7B). To
exclude the so-called "off-target" effects, A2780 cell lines with

www.aacrjournals.org

knocked down Plk2 (A2780KD) were retransfected with a Plk2
expression plasmid (A2780KD þ KI). The effect of Plk2
reexpression was increased paclitaxel-induced G2-M blocked
and sub-G1 populations, relative to the A2780KD cells
(Fig. 7B). Next, we ectopically expressed Plk2 in A2780TaxR354
cells which have undetectable levels of endogenous Plk2. Flow
cytometry revealed that in A2780TaxR354 KI cell lines engineered to ectopically express Plk2, there was restoration of the
paclitaxel-dependent G2-M checkpoint, which was lost in the
A2780TaxR354 cells (Fig. 7C). Finally, we used transient transfection of Plk2 siRNA to silence expression in SKOV-3 parental
cells. Western blotting confirmed downregulation of Plk2

paclitaxel and carboplatin for 48 hours. There was a reproducible reduction in apoptosis induced by both paclitaxel and
carboplatin in cells silenced for Plk2 expression compared
with control cells (Fig. 7E).

Plk2 is a candidate predictor of chemotherapy
resistance in EOC
We used qMSP to analyze methylation in the Plk2 CpG
island in a test series of 54 cases of EOC, treated in a single
center with postoperative carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Thirty-four cases had relapsed clinically at the time of
censor (as evidenced by rising serum CA125 levels and/or CT
evidence of progressive disease), whereas 20 cases remained
disease free at the time of censor. Full clinical details of the
cases are given in Supplementary Table S2. Methylation in
tumor tissues in the Plk2 CpG island was detected by using
qMSP in 19 of 54 (31%) cases at diagnosis. Cases with
methylation in tumor tissue at diagnosis were more likely
to have relapsed at the time of censor than those with

CpG methylation in serum (where available). Thirty-nine of 50
sera were concordant with the methylation status of their
matched tumor tissue (P ¼ 0.00216, Fisher's exact test). We
asked whether the presence of methylated Plk2 DNA in serum
was more common at relapse than at diagnosis. Paired sera at
diagnosis and relapse were available for 32 cases. Twentythree of 32 sera were concordant with the matched tissue (P ¼
0.011, Fisher's exact test). The proportion of sera with detectable methylation was higher at relapse than at diagnosis but
because of small sample numbers, this did not reach statistical
significance (0.47 vs. 0.62, P ¼ 0.204). Although there was a
clear trend for shorter relapse-free survival in cases with

detectable methylated DNA from the Plk2 CpG island, both in
tumor tissue and serum, this did not reach statistical significance with the small numbers of cases available for study
(P ¼ 0.142 for tissue and 0.054 for serum). See Supplementary
Figure 3 for additional data and Kaplan–Meier survival curves.
These data suggest that detection of methylated Plk2 DNA
may have utility in prediction of clinical outcome in EOC.

Discussion
We have shown that Plk2 is a determinant of cellular
sensitivity to paclitaxel and carboplatin and via a mechanism
of methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing, Plk2 is
associated with drug resistance. Paclitaxel resistance in
A2780 cell lines was associated with reduction or complete
loss of the drug-induced G2-M checkpoint and reduced apoptosis. Similarly, in paclitaxel- or carboplatin-resistant SKOV-3
cells, there was reduced apoptosis relative to drug-sensitive

www.aacrjournals.org

parental cells. Importantly, in A2780 and SKOV-3 cell lines
with acquired resistance to paclitaxel, there was significantly
reduced apoptosis when challenged with platinum compounds. Moreover, carboplatin-resistant SKOV-3 cells exhibited reduced apoptosis when exposed to paclitaxel.
Plk2 has both G2-M checkpoint (16) and proapoptotic (15)
function(s), prompting us to ask whether changes in expression of Plk2 occur with acquisition of drug resistance. Plk2
expression was reduced relative to parent cell lines in A2780
and SKOV-3 cell lines with acquired resistance to paclitaxel
and also in a SKOV-3 cell line resistant to carboplatin. The
specificity of these effects was emphasized by analysis of the
related genes Plk1 and Plk3/Fnk/Prk in which there were no
changes in expression with acquisition of resistance to paclitaxel. Three other lines of experimental evidence support an
important role for Plk2 as a determinant of drug sensitivity.
First, ectopic expression of Plk2 in cells in which endogenous
Plk2 was epigenetically downregulated substantially restored

sensitivity to paclitaxel. Second, RNAi-mediated "knockdown"
of Plk2 in drug-sensitive A2780 and SKOV-3 parental cell lines
conferred reduced sensitivity to paclitaxel and platinum
compounds, accompanied by reduced G2-M block and apoptosis, an effect reversible by reexpression of Plk2. Third, low to
moderate degrees of paclitaxel resistance were reversible
when cells were allowed a drug-free "holiday." In such cell
lines, with reacquired drug sensitivity, expression of Plk2
increased with increasing drug sensitivity. Our results are
compatible with studies showing that decreased sensitivity
to paclitaxel is associated with compromised checkpoint
function or spindle assembly (23–25). Our data are also
consistent with microarray analyses of platinum-resistant cell
lines in which Plk2 is downregulated (21, 26). Together, these
results afford further support for the candidacy of Plk2 as a
determinant of chemotherapy sensitivity and for a predominantly epigenetic basis for acquired drug resistance (27). Our
data also imply that Plk2 expression and Plk2-associated

3324

kinase activity may be required, at least in some cell types,
for sensitivity to chemotherapy. This is supported by a recent
study in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in which failure of Plk2
upregulation was associated with chemotherapy resistance
(28).
Our hypothesis that dynamic changes in the epigenetic
status of Plk2 influence the drug sensitivity of cancer cells
is supported by various lines of evidence from other authors.
For example, changes in DNA methylation within the CpG
islands of specific genes are detectable very rapidly after
exposure to cytotoxic agents (29). Also, increasing cisplatin
resistance in vivo is associated with elevated expression of
methyltransferases and quantitative changes in CpG island
methylation (21). In vivo supportive evidence comes from
studies of the DNA mismatch repair gene hMLH1. Inactivation
of hMLH1 is associated with increased resistance to cisplatin
in vitro. Analysis of methylated DNA in serum of individuals
receiving platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy for EOC

revealed that methylation levels changed during chemotherapy and had utility in predicting clinical outcome (30). A
profiling study of global changes in the methylome of drugsensitive and -resistant MCF-7 cells supports a general model
of acquired drug resistance in which opposing and ongoing
hypo- and hypermethylation in multiple genes constitute a
major mechanism driving the process of drug resistance (31).
In initial clinical studies, we have shown that cases of EOC
with Plk2 methylation at diagnosis were at significantly
increased risk of early clinical relapse with a less favorable
response to postoperative chemotherapy than cases lacking
methylation. Also, methylated Plk2 DNA in serum was more
common at clinical relapse than at initial diagnosis. Our
results imply that analysis of Plk2 methylation may have
utility as a biomarker of both disease activity and chemosensitivity in EOC. In the context of our results, Plk2 has been
identified as a significantly downregulated gene in chemotherapy-resistant primary ovarian carcinomas, affording indepen-

dent validation of our hypothesis for it being a determinant of
chemotherapy sensitivity and candidate biomarker in EOC
(32). An important feature of the taxane-resistant cell line
models we used in the current study is their cross-resistance
with platinum agents. In support of this, previous reports in
the literature cite decreased platinum sensitivity with crossresistance to chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxanes, in
EOC cell lines (33). Clinically, a proportion of EOC patients
show platinum–taxane non–cross-resistance (34). Both our
cell line panel data and our EOC patient cohort used in
this study are representative of platinum and taxane crossresistance.
We previously reported that Plk2 is subject to transcriptional downregulation in B lymphomas, and expression profiling has shown that Plk2 downregulation is a predictor of poor
clinical outcome in B lymphomas (35). Our data are in support
of clinical trials of epigenetic therapies in EOC patients and
other cancer patients (36) and suggest that detection of
