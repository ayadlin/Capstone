ABSTRACT
LNX (Ligand of Numb Protein-X) proteins, LNX1 and LNX2, are RING- and PDZ-based
E3-ubiquitin ligases known to interact with Numb. Silencing of LNX2 has been reported
to down-regulate WNT and NOTCH, two key signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Here
we report the identification of the domain boundary of LNX2 to confer its ubiquitination
activity, its crystal structure along with functional studies. We show that the RING domain
in LNX2 is flanked by two Zinc-binding motifs (Zn-RING-Zn), in which the N-terminal
Zinc-binding motif adopts novel conformation. Although this motif follows the typical
Cys2His2-type zinc finger configuration, it is devoid of any secondary structure and forms
an open circle conformation, which has not been reported yet. This unique N-terminal
Zn-finger motif is indispensable for the activity and stability of LNX2, as verified using
mutational studies. The Zn-RING-Zn domain of LNX2 is a dimer and assumes a rigid
elongated structure that undergoes autoubiquitination and undergoes N-terminal
polyubiquitination. The ubiquitin chains consist of all seven possible isopeptide linkages.
These results were validated using full-length LNX2. Moreover we have demonstrated
the ubiquitination of cell fate determinant protein, Numb by LNX2. Our study provides a
structural basis for the functional machinery of LNX2 and thus provides the opportunity
to investigate suitable drug targets against LNX2.

cellular processes, such as apoptosis [7], p53 signaling [8],
and DNA repair pathways [9], among others. Abnormal
regulation in these processes lead to dysregulated cell
growth signals or genomic instability, which are associated
with oncogenic progression [10]. It is therefore important
to know how these RING-type E3 ligases regulate so
many processes as well as themselves.
The LNX (Ligand of Numb protein-X) or PDZRN
(PDZ and RING) family of proteins comprises five
members, LNX1–LNX5 [11]. The domain architecture
for these proteins shows the presence of a RING domain
(Really Interesting New Gene) and one to four PDZ (PSD95, DlgA, ZO-1) domains [11]. LNX1 protein was first
identified as a binding partner to the mNumb PTB domain
[12] and, later, its over-expression was shown to increase the
proliferation of neuroepithelial cells rather than promoting
their differentiation into neuron or glial cells [13]. Jing
and co-workers [14] showed that LNX1 functions as an
E3-ubiquitin ligase and degrades Numb in a ubiquitindependent manner. The homologous LNX2 protein also

INTRODUCTION
Among the numerous posttranslational modifications
that exist for proteins, ubiquitination has been revealed to be
an important mechanism for the spatiotemporal regulation
of many cellular processes. Ubiquitination occurs through
sequential steps where ubiquitin (Ub) is transferred from
a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) to a catalytic cysteine
on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The E2-Ub
conjugate then cooperates with an ubiquitin ligase (E3) to
transfer Ub to the substrate [1, 2] or to the E3 itself, in the
case of autoubiquitination. Approximately 616 RING/Ubox-dependent E3s have been found in humans [3], in
contrast with just 2 known human E1 enzymes and less
than 40 human E2 enzymes [4]; this large number of E3
enzymes attaches importance to their role in conferring the
specificity of the ubiquitination process.
There are two predominant families of E3 ligases:
HECT-type ligases [5] and RING finger-type ligases [6].
The RING-type E3 ligases are known to regulate key

Numblike [15]. LNX2 interacts with junction adhesion
molecule 4 (JAM 4) [16] to augment the effect of hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) [17], an important factor in epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) [18]. LNX2 is also regarded
as an oncogene and found to be overexpressed in colorectal
cancer patients [[19] and The Human Protein Atlas, www.
proteinatlas.org/]. LNX2 activates WNT signaling, whereas
silencing LNX2 reduces the expression of NOTCH1 and
several of its downstream targets [19]. Moreover, LNX2
interacts with contactin-associated protein 4 (Caspr4) in
a PDZ-dependent manner, a gene involved with autism
spectrum disorders (ASDs) [20]. LNX2 also affects T-cellmediated immune responses by regulating the level of the
T-cell co-receptor, CD8 [21]. Yet, despite the importance of
LNX2 in each of these signaling mechanisms, the structure
and how it mediates its function are not yet reported.
As a continuation of our studies pertaining to E3
ligases [22–26], we sought to elucidate the functionally
relevant domains of the LNX2 protein. Here, using crystal
structure analysis and relevant functional studies, we
report the presence of a novel zinc finger motif in LNX2
that is indispensable for its ubiquitination activity.

on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The ubiquitinated species were
excised, digested with trypsin and analyzed with mass
spectrometry which showed the presence of distinct
peptide composed of the C-terminal Gly-Gly or Lys-ArgGly-Gly of one ubiquitin linked to the ε-amino group
of a lysine and the neighboring residues in the adjacent
ubiquitin (Supplementary Figure S1). This demonstrated
that FL-LNX2 formed polyubiquitin chains containing all
seven possible isopeptide linkages, which is consistent
with our previous results (Figure 1C).

Polyubiquitination of human numb and effect
of autoubiquitination on the substrate E3 ligase
activity of LNX2
Human numb plays a key role in neurogenesis and
is known to bind LNX1 that leads to its proteasomedependent degradation through ubiquitination [14, 15].
We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay in the
presence or absence of E1, E2, FL-LNX2, GST-Numb,
Ubiquitin and ATP followed by western blot. We observed
that human Numb acts as a substrate for FL-LNX2 and
undergoes polyubiquitination (Figure 2A and 2B).
Subsequently, we examined the role of
autoubiquitinated LNX2 in the ubiquitination of Numb
in an in vitro system where the autoubiquitination could
be separated from the subsequent Numb ubiquitination.
Maltose binding protein (MBP)- tagged FL-LNX2 was
autoubiquitinated in the presence of E1, E2 and ubiquitin.
After the reaction, amylose beads were used to pull down
the modified or ubiquitinated FL-LNX2. The beads were
washed and then used in a fresh ubiquitination reaction
in the presence of Numb. Notably the autoubiquitinated
LNX2 rapidly ubiquitinated the human Numb, however
the ubiquitination was not as strong as compared to
unmodified or non-ubiquitinated LNX2 (Figure 3A, 3B
and 3C).

RESULTS
Identification of E2-conjugating enzyme for the
autoubiquitination of LNX2
Autoubiquitination is a characteristic feature of the
RING-type E3 ligases [27], and serves to autoregulate
the stability of the ligase [28]. We expressed the fulllength LNX2 (FL-LNX2) and identified that the UbcH5
E2 family is involved in mediating the E3 ligase activity
of LNX2 using the E2 profiling kit (Life Sensors)
(Figure 1A). We confirmed this result using ubiquitination
assays followed by western blot analysis, showing that the
FL-LNX2 undergoes autoubiquitination in the presence of
E1, UbcH5b E2, ubiquitin and ATP but not in the absence
of UbcH5b E2 (Figure 1B).
E3-ligases tend to form specific polyubiquitin
chains that comprise a single isopeptide linkage.
However, Hyoung and colleagues have shown that, in
the presence of UbcH5b, certain E3 ligases can form
ubiquitin chains that contain all seven of the possible
isopeptide linkages [29]. To identify the nature of the
isopeptide linkages formed by FL-LNX2, we performed a
ubiquitination assay using single lysine ubiquitin mutants,
each of which containing only one lysine residue with
six other lysine residues replaced by arginine. Notably,
all seven ubiquitin mutants led to the formation of
polyubiquitin chains (Figure 1C). To further rule out the
possibility whether these ubiquitin mutants modify the
types of linkages formed, we adopted the methodology
used by J. Peng et al ([30]). Ubiquitination assay was
performed using WT-ubiquitin followed by its separation

Identification of ubiquitination domain and its
structure
The RING domain of RING-type E3 ligases is solely
responsible for its ubiquitination activity [31]. Therefore,
we sought to find the shortest sequence in FL-LNX2 that
would confer ubiquitination using various truncation
mutants. We found that a construct containing amino
acids 20-147 of FL-LNX2 was functional and stable in
solution. Repeating our ubiquitination experiments above,
we found similarities between the FL-LNX2 protein and
the truncated LNX2 (20-147 aa) (Figure 4).
Next we crystallized this construct to elucidate
its structure. The structure was determined to 1.86 Å
resolution (Figure 5A–5D and Supplementary Table S1).
LNX2 (20-147 aa) exists as dimer in the crystal, with
two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 5B). The
last six residues of this domain were not well defined in

model. The structure consists of a core RING domain
(Asp46-Arg90) flanked by two zinc finger motifs on
either side (hereafter referred to as the Zn-RING-Zn
domain) (Figure 5A). The core RING domain of LNX2
adopts a typical RING fold, comprising one central α
helix, two antiparallel β strands and two long loops.
This RING domain is stabilized by two zinc ions but,
unlike the Cys4HisCys3 “cross-brace” formation, one
of the cysteine residues is replaced by an aspartic acid
residue (Supplementary Figure S2); this has also been
shown in a few other proteins, such as Rbx1 [32]. LNX2
was previously proposed to have only five domains—a
N-terminal RING domain and four PDZ domains on the
C-terminal [11]; the zinc finger motifs identified here were
not predicted.
A structural homology search with the DALI server
[33]
(http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server/)
identified several RING domains of other proteins,
including TRAF6, that showed similarity to the 40–147aa
stretch of LNX2 (i.e., the RING and C-terminal Zn finger
(Supplementary Figure S3)); however, no structural
homologue could be identified for the first 21 amino acids
(N-terminal Zn finger) of this domain. This N-terminal
Zn-finger motif forms a unique open circle conformation,
with a zinc ion at the centre that stabilizes this part of the
structure (Figure 6A and 6B). Although it fulfils the required
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

criteria for a Cys2His2-type zinc finger, it does not adopt
any secondary structure and does not conform to any known
fold group of zinc fingers so far described. Thus, we posit
that the Zn-RING-Zn domain of LNX2 is unique.

Importance of zinc finger motifs in LNX2
The RING domain is generally considered to be
sufficient to confer the ubiquitination function of RINGtype E3 ligases. Next, we sought to identify the role of
these two Zn finger motifs present in the Zn-RING-Zn
domain. First, we truncated the beginning 21 aa of the ZnRING-Zn domain to 47-147aa to remove the N-terminal
Zn finger; however, this construct did not express in a
soluble form. Next, we mutated the conserved cysteine
residue to alanine in the Zn finger motifs of the Zn-RINGZn domain to disrupt the Zn coordination. These single
point mutant constructs were expressed, purified and used
for ubiquitination assays. The Cys26Ala (N-terminal)
mutant did not show any ubiquitination activity as
compared to the wild-type Zn-RING-Zn construct and
Cys120Ala (C-terminal) mutant (Figure 6C, right), and
this observation was further validated using FL-LNX2
(Figure 6C, left). Collectively, these findings suggest that
the N-terminal Zn finger motif is indispensable for the
ubiquitination function of FL-LNX2.

analysis. The point mutants, Asp45Ala and Lys109Ala, were
expressed and separated on a calibrated gel-filtration column.
The gel filtration profile showed that the Lys109Ala mutant
eluted as monomer (~15 kDa), whereas the Asp45Ala
mutant eluted as dimer, similar to the wild-type Zn-RINGZn domain (Figure  7A and Supplementary Figure S7B).
Circular dichroism profiles for the wild type and mutant
constructs showed no difference (Supplementary Figure
S7A). These observations suggest that a Lys109Ala mutation
disrupts the dimerization of the Zn-RING-Zn domain.
Next, we sought to understand the importance of this
dimerization for LNX2 ubiquitination, using both wild-type
Zn-RING-Zn and the Lys109Ala mutant in ubiquitination
assays. Immunoblotting showed that both wild-type and
the dimer-disrupted Lys109Ala mutant carried out equally

The gel filtration profiles of the Zn-RING-Zn
domain and the FL-LNX2 along with the Analytical
Ultracentrifugation experiment on FL-LNX2 indicate
that both are dimers (Supplementary Figure S4 and S5
respectively). This is consistent with the observed ZnRING-Zn dimers in the crystal. The dimeric interface has
a buried surface area of 657.9 Å2 from each monomer,
with six hydrogen-bonding contacts (< 3.2Å) and several
hydrophobic interactions. Notably, Lys109 of one monomer
makes hydrogen-bonding contacts with Asp45 and Asp47
of the other monomer in the dimeric Zn-RING-Zn domain
(Supplementary Figure S6). Therefore, we next examined the
role of these residues in the dimerization by point mutation

efficient autoubiquitination (Figure 7B), suggesting that
dimerization of the Zn-RING-Zn domain is not required for
autoubiquitination; this is consistent with previous reports
on RING-type E3 ligases [34].
To further validate our result, we sought to repeat
the same experiments using FL-LNX2. According to Rice
and colleagues [15], mouse LNX2 has at least two separate
oligomerization sites: one at the N-terminal RING domain
and the other at the extreme C-terminus (Ser685 and
Val687). We mutated the N-terminal dimerization residue,
Lys109A, and the corresponding C-terminal residues,
Ser688 and Val690, of human FL-LNX2 to Asp and
Glu, respectively, as suggested by Rice et al. This triple
mutant did not elute as monomer but eluted as a higherorder oligomer in gel filtration. This might be due to the
presence of other dimerization sites in FL-LNX2.

(Ub-KO) to prevent the formation of polyubiquitin
chains. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel
where multiple bands were observed corresponding to
multi-monoubiquitination (Figure 8A) suggesting that all
lysines are involved in autoubiquitination. We next sought
to verify whether this domain undergoes N-terminal
ubiquitination by adopting the protocol previously
reported by others [35], with some modifications (see
Methods). Using an N-terminal 6 × His-tagged Zn-RINGZn domain (with the protease cleavage site between the
His-tag and the protein) and Ub-KO, we performed a
ubiquitination assay followed by protease cleavage and
Ni-NTA-beads pull-down, collecting the flow-through,
washes and beads for immunoblotting. The detection of
a band at ~9 kDa using both anti-ubiquitin and anti-His
confirmed the presence of His-tagged ubiquitin, which
is only possible if Zn-RING-Zn undergoes N-terminal
ubiquitination (Figure 8B and Supplementary Figure
S8A). Collectively it indicates that this domain undergoes
ubiquitination at its N-terminus.

Zn-RING-Zn domain undergoes N-terminal
ubiquitination
Lysine residues are well known sites for
ubiquitination. The Zn-RING-Zn domain of LNX2 has ten
lysine residues, of which three are in the RING domain;
rest span the C-terminal region of the protein. To identify
the lysine residues that are involved in autoubiquitination
we performed the ubiquitination assay using a ubiquitin
in which all the lysines have been mutated to arginine

with Numb and with a similar protein, Numblike [15].

Figure 9: Schematic model of the cross-talk between LNX2 and WNT/NOTCH pathways. For clarity, we show the effect

of LNX2 on NOTCH pathway with the WNT pathway unaffected. However, NOTCH and WNT pathways have been reported to work
cooperatively in tumorigenesis and hence a change in one will affect the other [41]. Based on our studies, LNX2 can bind numb and induce its
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation [44]. Numb inhibits the NOTCH pathway by degrading NICD [53]. Aberrant changes
in the WNT and NOTCH pathways have been associated with cancer [54, 55]. This leads us to speculate a role for LNX2 in tumorigenesis by
affecting the WNT and NOTCH pathways through the ubiquitination of Numb. Our study provides the structure of the functional machinery of
LNX2 and thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Abbreviations: NICD, Notch intracellular domain; Ub, Ubiquitin.

hypothesized that LNX1 and LNX2 might harbour a
similar conserved zinc-coordinating residues as shown
for the HYB domain. However till date no structurebased insight into the mechanism of action of LNX2
or any of its homologues is available. To this end,
here we report the minimum region responsible for
the ubiquitination activity of LNX2 and identify a
novel, open circle conformation Zinc finger motif at
the N-terminus that is essential for its ubiquitination
function. We show that although LNX2 exists as a dimer
in solution, this dimerization is not required for its
autoubiquitination.
In our structural homology search for the ZnRING-Zn domain, we identified TRAF6 as the closest
homologue to LNX2 (RMSD of 1.41 Å for 93 Cα atoms).
However, the homology only extended to the RING and
C-terminal Zn finger motif, with the N-terminal novel
open circle Zn finger motif of LNX2 absent in TRAF6.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We show that LNX2 undergoes autoubiquitination similar
to that reported for TRAF6 [36]. However, TRAF6 uses
a different E2-conjugating enzyme than LNX2. We
speculate that the N-terminal Zn finger motif in LNX2
might play a deciding role in the selection of E2 for its
activity. Moreover based on our mutational studies we
have shown the essential role of this structural motif for
the function of LNX2.
Further it has been reported that TRAF6
dimerization is indispensable for its autoubiquitination
but LNX2 can undergo autoubiquitination as a
monomer or a dimer. A similar observation has been
reported for MDM2, where it was shown that RING
oligomerization is not important for the protein’s
autoubiq­uitination [34].
We showed that the ubiquitin chains formed by
LNX2 contain all seven possible isopeptide linkages.
Formation of these polyubiquitin chains has been shown

to have pathological implications, for example, in
neurodegenerative diseases [37]. Similar polyubiquitin
chain formation has been linked to other RING-type E3
ligases, such as MuRF1 and Mdm2, a key oncogene and
negative regulator of p53 tumor suppressor [29].
As detailed earlier, LNX2 is reported to be an
oncogene [19] and its silencing affects the NOTCH1
and WNT signalling pathways. Notch signalling plays a
critical role in cellular proliferation, differentiation and
colorectal epithelial maturation [38], and any aberrant
change in this pathway could lead to cancer or tumor
formation [39]. In terms of its role in WNT signalling,
LNX2 modulates β-catenin and TCF7L2 [19], two
key downstream effectors of WNT [40]. It has been
reported that the collaborative effect of NOTCH and
WNT pathways is responsible for cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis [41]. Moreover LNX1 and LNX2 bind
numb—an inhibitor of NOTCH pathway [42, 43]—
and lead to its proteasome-dependent degradation by
ubiquitination [14, 15] thereby enhancing NOTCH
signalling [44, 45]. Here we showed the in vitro
ubiquitination of Numb by LNX2. From these collective
observations, we are tempted to speculate that LNX2
plays an important role in tumorigenesis by affecting
WNT and NOTCH pathways through the ubiquitination
of numb (Figure 9).
In conclusion, we have identified the minimum
region of LNX2 (ZN-RING-Zn domain) responsible for
its ubiquitination activity and studied its structure and
function. We revealed the presence of a novel, open circle
Zinc finger motif at the N-terminus that is indispensable
for the ubiquitination function of LNX2. Furthermore, in
addition to its autoubiquitination, we show that LNX2
undergoes N-terminal ubiquitination. Besides, we show
the substrate E3 ligase activity of LNX2 by ubiquitination
of human Numb. Our studies provide insight into the
ubiquitination of LNX2 and might lead to the development
of therapeutic interventions that target the Zn-RING-Zn
domain.

Crystallization and structure determination
Drops containing 1 μL of protein solution (7.5 mg/ml)
and 1 μL of reservoir solutions were equilibrated by
hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 25°C. The best
crystals were grown from 0.1 M MES monohydrate pH 6.5,
12% w/v polyethylene glycol 20,000 with the protein in 10
mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5
mM DTT. A complete SAD data set was collected to 1.86
Å resolution at the beam line 13B1, National synchrotron
radiation research center (NSRRC, Taiwan), using a
Quantum-315r CCD area detector (ADSC) and processed
with HKL2000 [47]. The crystals belonged to space group

All of the expected eight Zn sites of an asymmetric

and analysed using PROCHECK [50]. All structure-related
figures were prepared using PyMOL [51].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids and bacterial strain
The genes for Human LNX2 (aa20–147), fulllength LNX2, Human Numb (p72) and UbcH5b
were from Genscript (USA). Human Ube1 was from
Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (plasmid 34965, deposited
by Cynthia Wolberger) [46]. For structural and
functional studies, all of the genes, with the exception
of Ube1, were cloned into pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare,
UK) or pMAL (NEB). Point mutants were generated
using the proofreading HiFi DNA polymerase (Kapa
Biosystems). Each sequence was verified by DNA
sequencing. All clones were expressed in BL21 (DE3)
bacterial strain.

In vitro ubiquitination assays
We incubated 0.05 μM E1 (Ube1), 1 μM E2 (UbcH5b),
2 μM WT or mutant Zn-RING-Zn domain and 20 μM WT or
mutant Ubiquitin at 37°C for 3 h in a reaction buffer containing
50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
ATP and 1 mM DTT. For substrate ubiquitination GST-Numb
was added to the above reaction mixture at 2 μM concentration.

The reaction was quenched using SDS loading buffer and was
resolved using 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were
transferred to PVDF membranes using a Tran-Blot SD SemiDry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then probed
with anti-ubiquitin or anti-LNX2 or anti-Numb antibody in
1:2000 dilutions followed by washing and then incubation with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or antimouse secondary antibodies in a 1:10,000 dilution. The bands
were visualized using ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce)
as instructed by the manufacturer.

USA) and reconstituted with 20 μl of diluent (98% Water,
2% Acetonitrile, 0.05% Formic acid). 2 μl of the sample was
loaded on a 200 μm x 0.5mm trap column and eluted on an
analytical 75 μm × 150mm column. Both trap and analytical
columns were made of ChromXP C18-CL, 3 μm (Eksigent,
Germany). Peptides were separated by a gradient formed by
2% ACN, 0.1% FA (mobile phase A) and 98% ACN, 0.1%
FA (mobile phase B): 5 to 7% of mobile phase B in 0.1min,
7 to 30% of mobile phase B in 10min, 30 to 60% of mobile
phase B in 4min, 90 to 90% of mobile phase B in 5min, 90 to
5% of mobile phase B in 0.1min and 5 to 5% of mobile phase
B in 10min, at a flow rate of 300. nl/min.
The MS analysis was performed on a TripleTOF 5600
system (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA, USA) in Information
Dependent Mode. MS spectra were acquired across the mass
range of 400–1800 m/z in high-resolution mode (>30000)
using 250 ms accumulation time per spectrum. A maximum
of 20 precursors per cycle were chosen for fragmentation
from each MS spectrum with 100 ms minimum accumulation
time for each precursor and dynamic exclusion for 15 s.
Tandem mass spectra were recorded in high sensitivity mode
(resolution > 15000) with rolling collision energy on.
Peptide identification and quantification was carried
on the ProteinPilot 4.5 software Revision 1656 (AB
SCIEX) using the Paragon database search algorithm
(4.5.0.0.) and the integrated false discovery rate (FDR)
analysis function. The data were searched against a
database consisting 2013_Novuniprot_sprot (total 40554
entries). The search parameters are as follows: Sample
Type — Idenification; Cys Alkylation  — Iodoacetamide;
Digestion — trypsin; Special Factors — Gel-based
ID,Ubiquitin/SUMO enrichment; Species — Homo sapines.
The processing was specified as follows: ID Focus—
Biological Modifications; Search Effort — Thorough;
Detected Protein Threshold — 0.05 (10.0%). For FDR
determination, data were searched against a concatenated
database with in silico on-the-fly reversal for decoy
sequences automatically by the software. Peptides identified
with confidence interval ≥ 95% were taken into account.

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC)
The oligomeric state of the full length LNX2 was
investigated by monitoring their sedimentation properties in
AUC sedimentation velocity experiments. Samples (370 μl) in
50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT with
an absorbance of 0.8 at 280 nm were used. Sedimentation
velocity profiles were collected by monitoring the absorbance
at 280 nm. The samples were centrifuged at 30,000 RPM
at 24°C in a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-I centrifuge fitted
with a four-hole AN-60 Ti rotor and double-sector aluminum
centerpieces and equipped with absorbance optics. The scans
were analyzed using the Sedfit program [52].

Ni-NTA pull down assay
After the ubiquitination assay, the reaction mixture
was kept for overnight cleavage with prescission enzyme.
The mixture was then incubated with Ni-NTA beads in
a 2 ml eppendorf at 4°C with mild rotation for 1 hr. The
beads were then spun at 3381 × g for 5 mins and then
the flow through was collected. The beads were then
equilibrated with wash buffer for 10 mins at 4°C. This was
followed up by spining the beads and collecting the wash.
This step was repeated three times.

Circular dichroism spectrometry
Far UV spectra (260–200 nm) of WT LNX2 (20147) and its mutants (K109A, C26A, C120A) were
measured using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco
Europe, MI, Italy) in 20 mM Bis-Tris, 100 mM NaCl and
5 mM DTT (pH 6.0) at room temperature using a 0.1cm path length and stoppered cuvettes. Six scans were
recorded, averaged, and the baseline subtracted.
