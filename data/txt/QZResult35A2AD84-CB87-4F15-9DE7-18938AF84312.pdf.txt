ABSTRACT
NF-κB activation depends on the IKK complex consisting of the catalytically
active IKK1 and 2 subunits and the scaffold protein NEMO. Hitherto, IKK2
activation has always been associated with IκBα degradation, NF-κB activation,
and cytokine production. In contrast, we found that in SCF-stimulated primary
bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), IKK2 is alternatively activated.
Mechanistically, activated TAK1 mediates the association between c-Kit and IKK2
and therefore facilitates the Lyn-dependent IKK2 activation which suffices to
mediate mitogenic signaling but, surprisingly, does not result in NF-κB activation.
Moreover, the c-Kit-mediated and Lyn-dependent IKK2 activation is targeted by
MyD88-dependent pathways leading to enhanced IKK2 activation and therefore to
potentiated effector functions. In neoplastic cells, expressing constitutively active
c-Kit mutants, activated TAK1 and IKKs do also not induce NF-κB activation but
mediate uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and enables IL-33 to
mediate c-Kit-dependent signaling. Together, we identified the formation of the
c-Kit-Lyn-TAK1 signalosome which mediates IKK2 activation. Unexpectedly, this
IKK activation is uncoupled from the NF-κB-machinery but is critical to modulate
functional cell responses in primary-, and mediates uncontrolled proliferation and
survival of tumor-mast cells. Therefore, targeting TAK1 and IKKs might be a novel
approach to treat c-Kit-driven diseases.

ubiquitinylation-dependent phosphorylation of the serine
(S) residue motive, S177/S181 of IKK2. This motive is
located in the activation loop of IKK2 [4, 5] and is pivotal
for IKK2 activation [5]. TAK1 is proposed as the upstream
IKK2 kinase which mediates S177/S181 phosphorylations
and therefore activation of IKK2 [6]. The consequence
of IKK2 activation is the phosphorylation of the NF-κB

The IKK complex consists of IKK1/2 and NEMO.
IKK1 and 2 are the catalytically active components
whereas NEMO is the regulatory scaffold protein of

inhibitor IκBα which is ubiqiutinylated and proteasomal
degraded. Therefore, NF-κB is released, translocates
into the nucleus and induces a cytokine production [7].
Recent publications suggests that receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) also activate NF-κB via the IKK complex [8, 9].
The RTK, c-Kit is critical for differentiation of cells of
the haematopoietic system [10–12]. Mast cell differentiation,
survival and proliferation also depend on c-Kit and on
the resulting STAT3/5, p38, and Phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K) activation [13–18]. However, expression
of constitutively active c-Kit mutants leads to persistently
activated STAT3/5, MAP-kinases, and PI3Ks and results in
the development of mastocytosis or mast cell tumors [19–23].
The IKK complex and NF-κB are important to
mediate the effector functions of mature mast cells
stimulated with ligands of the TIR superfamily (e.g. IL33R; [24]) or by crosslinking of the Fcε receptor I [FcεRI;
[25]). Recent data suggest that IKKs are also crucial to
induce NF-κB-dependent tumorigenesis [26].
We show that stimulation of BMMCs with SCF,
the overexpression of wt c-Kit or the expression of
constitutively active c-Kit mutants mediates activation of
IKK2. Surprisingly, the c-Kit-mediated IKK2 activation
does not lead to NF-κB activation but is critical for
differentiation, proliferation and survival of primary- and
tumor-mast cells. Therefore, the c-Kit-mediated IKK2
activation regulates mast cell effector functions and might
be a novel approach to treat c-Kit-driven diseases.

the activation of STAT3/5 and proliferation even at very
low concentrations (0,5–0,1 μM) (Supplementary Figures
S1E and S1F). Compared to the results obtained with
ikk2Δ BMMCs, these data show that IKK-inhibitor VII
treatment or the reduced IKK2 expression affected the
same SCF-induced signaling pathways. Therefore, it can
be assumed that the IKK-inhibitor VII preferentially blocks
IKK activation in mast cells. Given that STATs are critical
for mast cell differentiation, we examined whether IKK2
contributes to proliferation and differentiation. As shown in
Figures 1C–1G, we found a slightly reduced proliferation
(Figure 1C) and a profound reduction of mast cell numbers
in the peritoneal fluid (Figures 1D and 1E), the ear- (Figure
1F) and back-skin of ikk2Δ mice (Figure 1G) compared to
control ikk2F/F mice. These data show that the SCF-induced
IKK2 activation mediates differentiation via STAT3/5.

IKKs mediate proliferation and cell survival of
tumor mast cells
We next investigated whether IKKs also contribute
to the signaling induced by constitutively active c-Kit
mutants. Therefore, we used HMC-1.1 (expressing the
imatinib-sensitive V560G c-Kit mutant) and HMC-1.2
cells (expressing the imatinib-insensitive D816V/V560G
c-Kit mutant) [33]. Indeed, incubation of HMC-1.1 cells
(Figures 2A–2C) or HMC-1.2 cells (Figures 2D–2F)
with the IKK-inhibitor VII blocked the constitutive
phosphorylation of STAT3/5, IκBα and also of PKB/Akt
(Figures 2A, 2D). Consequently, the IKK-inhibitor VII
blocked the proliferation (Figures 2B, 2E) by inducing cell
death (Figures 2C, 2F) in both, HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2
cells and therefore overcomes imatinib resistance.
Next, we investigated the transforming potential
of the D816V c-Kit mutant and its dependency on IKKs.
Confirming others [34], expression of the D816V Kit
mutant, but not of wt c-Kit potentiated the basal proliferation
of Ba/F3 cells (Figure 3A). Pre-treatment with the IKKinhibitor VII reduced the basal proliferation of D816V
c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells for about 200 fold whereas the
proliferation of parental Ba/F3 or wt c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3
cells was reduced up to 50 fold (Figure 3B). This shows that
D816V c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells are up to four times
more sensitive to the IKK-inhibitor VII than parental Ba/F3
or wt c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells.
We further examined the induced signaling
pathways in these Ba/F3 cell clones. In parental Ba/F3 we
could not detect the activation of STATs, PKB/Akt and
MAP-kinases (Figures 3C–3E). In wt c-Kit-expressing
Ba/F3 cells, the activation of Erk1/2 but not of PKB/Akt
and STATs was slightly increased (Figures 3C–3E). In
contrast, in D816V c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells we found
a strong activation of Erk1/2, PKB/Akt and STAT3 which
were blocked by the IKK-inhibitor VII (Figures 3C–3E).
These data indicate that constitutively active c-Kit mutants
mediate IKK-dependent mitogenic signaling.

RESULTS
SCF induces IKK2 activation
Aiming to investigate the SCF-induced signaling
in BMMCs we unexpectedly found that SCF induces
IKK2 activation which was blocked by the c-Kit inhibitor
imatinib (Figure 1A). To delineate the role of IKK2 in the
SCF-induced signaling and effector functions, we used
IKK2 deficient BMMCs from inducible ikk2Δ mice [27]
and from cre−, Ikk2F/F control mice, as well as the IKKinhibitor VII [28, 29]. We focused on the SCF-induced
STAT and PI3K activation, since inactivation of these
signaling cascades, but not MAPKs (Supplementary
Figures S1A–S1C) compromises mitogenic mast cell
responses [17, 18, 30, 31].
The reduced expression of IKK2 in ikk2Δ BMMCs
(Figure 1B) does not affect surface expression of c-Kit
compared to control ikk2F/F BMMCs (Supplementary
Figure S1D). The SCF-induced PKB/Akt activation was
unperturbed, whereas the activation of STAT3/5 was
reduced in ikk2Δ compared to ikk2F/F BMMCs (Figure 1B).
To confirm these results we used the IKK-inhibitor VII
[32]. We pre-incubated BMMCs with different IKKinhibitor VII concentrations and stimulated with SCF.
We found that the IKK-inhibitor VII does not affect the
SCF-induced activation of PKB/Akt but strongly reduced

Src-family kinases (SFKs) mediate IKK2 and
STAT3/5 activation

[37]. Additionally we found that the Jak2 inhibitor
AG490 did not influence the SCF-induced proliferation
(Supplementary Figure S2C). This confirms that SFKs
but not Jak2 are required for the SCF-induced STAT
activation and the resulting proliferation in BMMCs.
Consequently, we suggest that SFKs positively regulate
the IKK2-STAT pathway and negatively regulate the
PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway. Lyn negatively regulates the
PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway and the resulting proliferation
in mast cells [13, 31]. Thus, we speculated that Lyn
also mediates activation of the IKK2-STAT pathway.
To test this hypothesis we used lyn−/− BMMCs. Indeed,
activation of c-Kit, IKK2 and STATs were reduced

Now, we focused on the mechanism leading
to IKK2 activation in BMMCs. SFKs regulate most
of the SCF-induced signaling pathways [35]. Preincubation of the SFK inhibitor SU6656 impaired the
activation of c-Kit, IKK2 and STATs but enhanced the
activation of PKB/Akt and did not affect the proliferation
(Supplementary Figures S2A and S2B). Next, we tested
the role Jak2 known as an upstream kinase of STATs
[36]. Shivakrupa et al., showed that Lyn is essential
for the SCF-induced STAT activation in BMMCs

The c-Kit-mediated IKK2 activation does not
result in NF-κB activation

(Figure 4A), whereas the activation of PKB/Akt and the
resulting proliferation were enhanced (Supplementary
Figures S2D and S2E) in lyn−/−, compared to wt BMMCs.
Therefore, inactivation of the mitogenic IKK2-STAT
signaling is compensated by upregulation of the PKB/
Akt signaling in lyn−/− BMMCs. This shows that Lyn
positively regulates the c-Kit-IKK2-STAT pathway and
negatively regulates the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway.
Given that Ca2+ is required for IKK2 activation [38],
we tested the role of the PLCγ-mediated Ca2+ mobilization
(Supplementary Figure S3A) in the SCF-induced IKK2-STAT
signaling. Pre-treatment with the PLC inhibitor U-73122 or the
Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM reduced the SCF-induced activation
of the c-Kit-IKK2-STAT pathway whereas the proliferation
was not affected (Supplementary Figures S3B–S3E).
Next, we examined the role of SFKs in the IKKdependent activation of STATs in HMC cells. Confirming
and extending others [39] pre-treatment of HMC-1.1
cells with SU6656 blocked the phosphorylation of
STAT5/3 and PKB/Akt (Figure 4B). These data show that
SFKs, as Lyn contribute to activation of the c-Kit-IKK2STAT pathway in mast cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IKK2 typically mediates NF-κB activation. Thus,
we determined whether SCF or constitutively active
c-Kit mutants induce IκBα phosphorylation, degradation
and NF-κB activation. Confirming that IKK2 activation
depends on Lyn-, PLCγ- and Ca2+, the SCF-induced
IκBα phosphorylation was blocked in lyn−/− BMMCs
(Figure  4C) or BMMCs treated with U-73122 or
BAPTA-AM (Supplementary Figures S3F and S3G).
Complementing these findings, treatment of HMC1.1 cells with the SFK inhibitor SU6656 reduced the
phosphorylation of IκBα (Figure 4D). However, neither
SCF nor the expression of constitutively active c-Kit
mutants influenced the stability of IκBα (Figures 4C
and 4D, Supplementary Figures S3F and S3G) suggesting
defective IKK2-IκBα signaling in our BMMCs or HMC1.1 cells.
To test the IKK2-IκBα signaling we stimulated
with IL-33 a typical inducer of the MyD88- and IKK2dependent canonical NF-κB signaling [40]. In contrast to

SCF, IL-33 induces a strong activation of IKK2, which
results in phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα

we used ikk2Δ BMMCs or the IKK-inhibitor VII. In both
cases the SCF-induced IκBα phosphorylation was blocked
(Figure 4G, Supplementary Figure S4C). Together these
results show that the IKK2-IκBα signaling is intact,

and is activated by SCF and IL-33 whereas only IL-33
stimulation induced an IKK activation which is strong
enough to induce IκBα degradation.
Finally, we determined the capacity of SCF to
induce NF-κB activation. Therefore, we used NF-κB-

EGFP-MC/9 cells [41]. In these cells we also found the
SCF-induced IKK2 activation but no IκBα degradation
(Figure 4H). Compared to IL-33, SCF did not induce
EGFP expression or a strong cytokine production (Figures
4I and 4J) indicating that SCF either induces a very weak
or no NF-κB activation.
Why does SCF not induce IκBα degradation and
NF-κB activation? We found that SCF in presence of
cycloheximide, a protein-biosynthesis inhibitor, induces
IκBα degradation (data not shown). Therefore, in presence
of ongoing IκBα re-synthesis, the SCF-induced IκBα
degradation is quantitatively not sufficient to induce a net
loss of IκBα.
Together, we found that neither stimulation with
SCF nor the expression of constitutively active c-Kit
mediates IκBα degradation. Consequently, we assume
that compared to IL-33, activated c-Kit mediates an
alternative mechanism leading to a weak “subthreshold
IKK2 activation” [28] which is insufficient to mediate
complete NF-κB activation.

motive is critical for IKK2 activation [42–44]. We found
that the SCF-induced IKK2 activation is Lyn-dependent.
Therefore, we speculated that SCF induces IKK2
activation via a Lyn-dependent phosphorylation of Y188/
Y199-IKK2. Indeed, SCF induced the phosphorylation of
Y199 which was reduced in lyn−/− BMMCs (Figure 5A).
In contrast, IL-33 did neither induce the phosphorylation
of Y199-IKK2 nor a SFK-dependent IKK2 activation
(Figures 5B and 5C).
We identified the PLCγ-Ca2+ signaling as critical for
the SCF-induced IKK2 activation. This indicated that the
PLCγ-Ca2+ signaling activates Lyn and therefore mediates
phosphorylation of Y199-IKK2. As shown in Figures 5D
and 5E, treatment with U-73122 or BAPTA-AM blocked
the activation of Lyn and the resulting phosphorylation
of Y199-IKK2. Taken together, these data indicate that
the SCF-induced IKK2 activation in BMMCs depends
on the PLCγ-Ca2+-Lyn pathway leading to Y199-IKK2
phosphorylation and therefore IKK2 activation.

SCF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IKK2
in BMMCs

Now, we examined the molecular mechanism leading
to IKK2 activation. First, we expressed c-Kit in HEK293T
cells to test whether endogenously expressed IKK2 associates
with c-Kit. Immunoprecipitation of overexpressed c-Kit did
not result in co-precipitation of IKK2 (Figure 6A, lane 2)

Huang et al. showed that in addition to
phosphorylation of the S177/S181-IKK2 motive, also the

excluding association between c-Kit and IKK2. TAK1 is the
upstream kinase of IKK2 [6]. Therefore, we speculated that
additional TAK1 overexpression leads to co-precipitation
of endogenous IKK2. Thus, we co-transfected HEK293T
cells with TAK1 and c-Kit, performed a c-Kit-specific
immunoprecipitation, and indeed detected IKK2 (Figure 6A,
lane 4) showing that TAK1 mediates the interaction between
c-Kit and IKK2. Confirming these results, we also found an
association between c-Kit, TAK1 and IKK2 in c-Kit-specific
immunoprecipitations from BMMC lysates (Figure 6B).

Given that Lyn is critical for IKK2 activation,
we assumed that Lyn also joins the c-Kit-TAK1-IKK2
complex. In Lyn precipitates we detected c-Kit and TAK1
(Figure 6C) but not IKK2 (Figure 6D) indicating that Lyn
interacts with c-Kit and TAK1 but not directly with IKK2.
Since, TAK1 was detectable in c-Kit and Lyn
precipitates we assumed that TAK1 is the critical
determinant for complex formation between c-Kit, IKK2
and Lyn. To determine the role of TAK1 we transfected
HEK293T cells with c-Kit or TAK1 alone or both

together. TAK1-specific immunoprecipitations confirmed
the association between c-Kit and TAK1 (Figure 6E,
compare lane 3 and 4). Furthermore, endogenous IKK2
and Lyn equally associates with TAK1 in cells either
overexpressing TAK1 alone or TAK1 in combination
with c-Kit (Figure 6E, compare lane 3 and 4) indicating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that the Lyn-TAK1-IKK2 complex associates with c-Kit.
However, only in cells co-overexpressing TAK1 and
c-Kit, the phosphorylation of Y199-IKK2 and the TAK1
ubiquitinylation were potentiated (Figure 6E, compare
lane 3 and 4). Given that Y199-IKK2 is a Lyn target,
we tested whether Lyn activation is also increased in
28842

HEK293T cells co-overexpressing TAK1 and c-Kit.
Indeed, in cells co-overexpressing both molecules,
highly activated Lyn, co-precipitates with TAK1 and
c-Kit (Supplementary Figure S5A, compare lane 3 and
4). Therefore, the preformed Lyn-TAK1-IKK2 complex
is highly activated in presence of c-Kit.
Next, we investigated the role of the TAK1activity in this complex formation. The TAK1 activity
and its association with IKK2 strongly depend on
Lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitinylation [45]. Overexpression
of the inactive K63W-TAK1 mutant [45] abrogated the
formation of the c-Kit-Lyn-TAK1-IKK2 complex and
therefore blocked the phosphorylation of Y199-IKK2
(Figure 6E, compare lane 5 and 6). These data indicate
that TAK1 ubiquitinylation mediates complex formation
between c-Kit, IKK2 and Lyn. This expression model
prompted us to investigate the role of TAK1 in BMMCs
and HMC cells. Therefore, we used the TAK1 inhibitor
5Z-7-oxozeanol [46]. Pre-incubation of BMMCs
with 5Z-7-oxozeanol reduced the activation of IKK2,
STAT3 and STAT5 but not of PKB/Akt (Supplementary
Figure S5B). In HMC cells 5Z-7-oxozeanol very potently
blocked the activation of IKKs, STAT3/5 and also of
PKB/Akt (Supplementary Figure S5C).
Here, we provide a mechanistical insight of the
c-Kit-mediated IKK2 activation. Thereby, overexpression
of c-Kit nearly mimics the effects occurring in SCFstimulated cells or in cells expressing constitutively active
c-Kit. From these experiments, we conclude that c-Kit
forms a complex with TAK, SFKs and IKK2. The complex
formation is thereby stabilized by TAK1 and results in a
SFK-dependent IKK2 activation. Consequently, TAK1 is
pivotal to induce the c-Kit-mediated activation of IKK2,
STAT3/5 in primary- and tumor-mast cells.

[48] eradicated the synergistic effect of co-stimulation on
proliferation (Figure 7G) but did not affect the potentiated
IL-6 production (Supplementary Figure S6K).
Finally, we determined the effect of co-stimulation
(SCF and IL-33) on the activation of TAK1 and IKK2.
Single-stimulation with SCF or IL-33 induced the activation
of TAK1 (Figure 7H) and IKK2 (Figure 7I). Co-stimulation
did not increase the activation of TAK1 (Figure 7H) but
enhanced the activation of IKK2 and delayed the IκBα resynthesis (Figure 7I). These data shows that the SCF-induced
and Lyn-dependent IKK2 is targeted by MyD88-dependent
pathways. This leads to enhanced IKK2 activity which results
in potentiated, NF-κB-dependent cytokine production, and in
STAT-dependent potentiated proliferation.

c-Kit supports IL-33-induced and TAK1- and
IKK2-dependent signaling in HMC cells
In contrast to BMMCs, IL-33 induced a c-Kitdependent activation of Erk1/2, JNK1/2 and PKB/Akt
in HMC cells and in BMMCs generated from kitD814V tg
mice [19, 47]. Here, we investigated whether TAK1 and
IKK2 contribute to IL-33-induced and c-Kit-dependent
signaling in HMC-1.1 cells. As shown in Figures 7J and
7K pre-incubation with the TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeanol
or with the IKK-inhibitor VII blocked the IL-33-induced
activation of PKB/Akt, JNK1/2 and Erk1/2. This shows that
in contrast to BMMCs, constitutively active c-Kit together
with TAK1 and IKK2 mediate the IL-33-induced activation
of PKB/Akt, JNK1/2 and Erk1/2. Therefore, constitutively
active c-Kit controls IL-33-induced and TAK1- and IKKdependent signaling and effector functions.

DISCUSSION

The conjoined activation of IKK2 by c-Kit- and
MyD88-dependent pathways

Here, we show that SCF and constitutively active
c-Kit mutants activate TAK1 and IKK2. In contrast to
TAK1 and IKK2 activation induced by antigen receptors,
TIR- and TNFR superfamily family members [49–51],
the c-Kit-mediated TAK1 and IKK2 activation is weak
and results in IκBα phosphorylation but not in IκBα
degradation and NF-κB activation. Instead, the c-Kitmediated TAK1 and IKK2 activation induces STATdependent differentiation, proliferation and survival of
primary- and tumor-mast cells.
Our findings differ from an earlier publication
by Wu et al., who reported that SCF induces IκBα
phosphorylation and degradation in BMMCs. In a later
paper, the same group reported that SCF induces IκBα
phosphorylation but not degradation in BMMCs which is
in accordance with our data. The reason for these different
findings remains unknown [52, 53]. We consistently
found IκBα phosphorylation without degradation upon
stimulation with SCF. Therefore, the relevant questions
are: how does c-Kit mediate TAK1 and IKK2 activation

Co-stimulation with SCF and IL-33 induces a
potentiated IL-6 production [47] and proliferation in
BMMCs. Both the potentiated proliferation (Figure 7A),
and cytokine production (Supplementary Figure S6A)
depends on MyD88.
Next, we investigated the role of the novel PLCγ-Ca2+signaling which activates Lyn and therefore IKK2 in BMMCs.
Pharmacological inhibition of PLCγ, SFKs, IKKs and TAK1
as well as Lyn and IKK2 deficiencies reduced the potentiated
proliferation (Figures 7B–7F) and the IL-6 production
(Supplementary Figures S6B–S6F). In contrast, inhibition
of MAPKs did neither affect the potentiated proliferation
(Supplementary Figures S6G and S6H) nor the potentiated
IL-6 production in a adequate, biological relevant magnitude.
(Supplementary Figures S6I and S6J).
IKK2 together with Lyn activate STAT3. There­fore,
we examined the role of STAT3 in BMMCs co-stimulated
with SCF and IL-33. Inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201

cells. J, K. HMC-1.1 cells were treated with the TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeanol (5Z-7-Ox.) (J) or the IKK-inhibitor VII (IKK-I VII) (K),
and were stimulated with IL-33. Lysates were analyzed by western blotting.

and what is the difference of the IKK2 activation induced
by TIR family members such as the IL-33R?
Both, c-Kit and IL-33R induce the activation of
TAK1 and IKK2. Given that c-Kit does not induce IκBα
degradation and NF-κB activation, this indicates that
critical components for IκBα degradation (e.g. activation
of MyD88-IRAK4-Traf6 signaling module) are not
activated. Compared to IL-33R, c-Kit does not mediate
the MyD88- and IRAK4-dependent (data not shown)
pathways excluding the canonical pathway for IKK2
activation. Thus, we assumed an alternative mechanism.
Indeed, in BMMCs the SCF-induced IKK2
activation is mediated by the PLCγ-Ca2+-Lyn-dependent
phosphorylation of IKK2 on Y199. Huang et. al., 2003
described that additional to phosphorylation of the S177/
S181-IKK2 motive, the SFK-dependent phosphorylation
of the Y188/Y199-IKK2 motive is also critically
involved in IKK2 activation [42–44]. Therefore, we
speculate that the SCF-induced IKK2 activation also
depends on the SFK-mediated Y199 phosphorylation.
Interestingly, the SCF-induced phosphorylation of
the S177/S181-IKK2 motive is transient whereas the
phosphorylation of Y199-IKK persists up to 120min.
This indicates that in contrast to the Y199-IKK2
phosphorylation, the phosphorylation of S177/S181IKK2 is strongly regulated by phosphatases [54].
Interestingly, this suggests that the SCF-induced and
long- persisting Y199-IKK2 phosphorylation primes
IKK2 for additional stimulation with IL-33. Thereby,
IKK2 phosphorylated on Y199 is targeted by the IL-33induced signaling leading to increased IKK2 activity and
therefore to potentiated mast cell effector functions.
Consistent with BMMCs, we also found a SFKdependent IκBα phosphorylation in cells expressing
constitutively active c-Kit. These data indicate that SCF
in BMMCs, and constitutively active c-Kit, mediate IKK
activation via SFKs.
The inefficiency of SCF or constitutively active c-Kit
to induce IκB degradation leads to a model in which fewer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IKK2 molecules are activated in response to c-Kit activation
than in response to stimuli such as IL-33. Thus, the threshold
of IKK activation which is necessary to induce IκBα
degradation is not attained and therefore NF-κB still blocked.
Here, we also provide the mechanistical insight for
this alternative IKK2 activation. IKK2 forms a complex
with TAK1 and Lyn. This TAK1-IKK2-Lyn complex
associates with c-Kit, via TAK1. The association of the
TAK1-IKK2-Lyn complex with c-Kit activates Lyn which
phosphorylates and activates IKK2. Since expression of
the K63W-TAK1 mutant abrogated the association of
the c-Kit-Lyn-TAK1-IKK2 complex, we hypothesize
that TAK1 ubiquitinylation is essential to stabilize this
complex and to mediate STAT3 activation. Which E3Ligase mediates TAK1 ubiquitinylation is unknown. We
presume a critical role of the E3-Ligase Cbl which is
involved in c-Kit-mediated signaling in mast cells [55].
Importantly, in BMMCs and in HMC cells, the
c-Kit-driven IKK activation also influences IL-33-induced
signaling pathways, and therefore enables IL-33 to deploy
its full biological effector functions. Therefore, the c-KitTAK1-IKK2 signaling not only mediates proliferation
and survival, but also influences NF-κB mediated effector
functions induced by TIR-family members.
These data show that the activated c-Kit-TAK1IKK2 signaling module dramatically alters and enhances
cellular effector functions. Therefore, dysregulation of
the c-Kit-TAK1-IKK2 signaling module could induce
pathological effector functions in inflamed tissues after
infection, allergy and necrosis or supports tumor growth.
Given that activated c-Kit is involved in the
development of autoimmune- [56, 57], and tumor- diseases
[58–61], targeting of the c-Kit-TAK1-IKK2 signaling module
might be an alternative approach to treat such diseases.
Especially the facts that (i) TAK1 or IKK2
inhibition induces cell death of tumor- but not of
primary-mast cells [32] and that (ii) TAK1 or IKK2
inhibition overcomes the resistance of tumor cells to
c-Kit inhibitors, suggest that targeting of the c-Kit28845

β-glycerophosphate; 2,5 mM MgCl2; 2 mM orthovanadate;
1 mM dithiothreitol; 20 μg/ml aprotinin; 20 μg/ml leupeptin
supplemented with 1% Triton) and protein concentration
was determined by using the BCA-kit (Pierce). Then protein
samples were boiled in 6 × Laemmli buffer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Mice were maintained at the Animal Research
Facility of the Universitätsklinikum Jena and Universität
Frankfurt. Animal experiments were approved by the
appropriate institutional and governmental committees for
animal welfare. We used sex- and age-matched myd88−/−,
lyn−/−, ikk2Δ [27], and either wild type (wt) littermates or
ikk2F/F-mice (cre− littermates) [27]. To induce deletion
of IKK2, 6–8 week old ikk2Δ or control mice (ikk2F/F;
cre− mice) were injected once with 250 μL of poly (I:C)
(Sigma) i.p. and were analyzed after 21d. [27]

Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates from HEK293T or BMMCs (prepared
with lysis buffer supplemented with 0,5% NP40) were
incubated (overnight) with a Lyn-, c-Kit-, or TAK1specific antibody (santa cruz) or goat-, mouse-, or
rabbit-IgG as non-specific control immunoglobulins
(Gentaur). Protein-G sepharose was added and incubated
for 4 h. Precipitates were washed with lysis buffer and
subsequently treated and boiled in 6 x Laemmli buffer.

Cell culture

Western blotting

HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM (PAA)
supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). HMC-1.1 and
HMC-1.2 cells were cultured in complete RPMI (PAA).
Ba/F3 clones were cultured in complete RPMI (PAA)
supplemented with 20 ng/ml X63Ag-653 BPV-rmIL-3
supernatant (mIL-3). The NF-κB reporter mast cell line NFκB-EGFP-MC/9 (provided by Dr. E. A. Barbu, NIDCR,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA;
[41]) was cultured in complete DMEM (PAA) supplemented
with 20 ng/ml mIL-3. For generation of BMMCs, bone
marrow cells were obtained from femur and tibia and were
cultured in complete IMDM (PAA) supplemented with 20
ng/ml mIL-3. After 4 weeks cell culture consisted of 95%
BMMCs (identified by expression of FcεRI, c-Kit, IL-33R).

Samples were separated in 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-Laemmli gels and transferred by electroblotting
onto nitrocellulose membranes (biostep). Membranes were
blocked with dry milk and incubated (overnight) with
antibodies detecting phosphorylated/ non-phosphorylated
proteins or Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TAK1. We used
the anti-HA antibody (provided by Prof. Böhmer, Centre
of Medical Biomedicine, Jena), anti-pY719-c-Kit/c-Kit,
anti-pY705-STAT3/STAT3, anti-pY694-STAT5/STAT5,

were washed in 0.1% Tween/TBS and incubated with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit-Ig, anti-goatIg (Santa Cruz) and anti-mouse-Ig (Thermo-scientific).
Detection was performed using ECL reagent (Pierce).

Transfection
HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1
(empty vector), pcDNA3.1-c-Kit and/ or pCMV-HATAK1 or pCMV-HA-K63W-TAK1 (kindly provided by
Prof. M. Kracht; Universität Giessen) by using lipofectamin
(Invitrogen) according to the manufactural procedures.

Flow cytometry
For detection of dead HMC-1.1 or HMC-1.2 cells,
samples were washed with PBA (0.25% BSA; 0.02%
sodium azide in PBS). Cells were left untreated or were
treated with propidium iodid (PI). For detection of mast
cell-specific surface marker, cells from cell cultures
or from the peritoneal cavity were washed with PBA.
Non-specific binding was blocked with anti-CD16/
CD32 (clone 2.4G2) and rat-IgG (Jackson). Cells were
stained with biotinylated IL-33R antibody (3E10; [62])
and PE- or APC-eFluor780-conjugated Streptavidin,
PE-conjugated CD117 antibody (BioLegend) and

Cell stimulation and lysis
HEK293T cells were washed with ice cold PBS
before lysis. HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 cells (106 cells/
ml) were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or inhibitors (60
min) (Merck Millipore). HMC-1.1 cells were then left
unstimulated or were stimulated with IL-33 (peprotech).
Ba/F3 cells, NF-κB-EGFP-MC/9 cells or BMMCs
(106 cells/ml) were IL-3-starved (1 h). Afterwards, Ba/
F3 cells were treated with DMSO or the IKK-inhibitor

washing with PBA-buffer, cells were analyzed for EGFP
production by using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD) and
FlowJo 9.8.0 (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR).

Samples of back skin or ear pinna were fixed in 4% (v/v)
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin ensuring a crosssectional orientation. For detection of mast cells, 5 μm sections
were metachromatically stained (Giemsa). Mast cell numbers
were counted per ear or back skin section over a length of
1 cm. Mean of 3 sections per mouse was calculated ± SD.

SCF, IL-33 or both. BaF/3 cells (2,5 × 105 cells/ml)
were IL-3-starved (1 h) and treated with DMSO or
the IKK-inhibitor VII. For proliferation assays cells
were cultured for 54 h. [3H]-thymidine (1 μCi) in 25 μl
complete IMDM (PAA) (without IL-3) was added to each
well for additional 18 h. Incorporated radioactivity was
measured by using a β-scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer,
Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany). For ELISA experiments
supernatants were collected (after 8 h) and analyzed
for cytokine production using matched pair antibodies
(ebioscience).

All experiments were performed at least three times.
Proliferation assays, and ELISAs were performed at least in
a 6-fold determination. Cytokine concentration, stimulation
