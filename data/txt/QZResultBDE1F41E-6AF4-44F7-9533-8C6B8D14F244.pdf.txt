ABSTRACT
Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs can act as either tumor suppressors or
oncogenes in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we identified the role of miR-34a
in regulating telomerase activity, with subsequent effect on cellular senescence and
viability. We found the higher expression of miR-34a was significantly correlated with
the advanced clinicopathologic parameters in hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore,
tumor tissues of 75 HCC patients demonstrated an inverse correlation between
the miR-34a level and telomere indices (telomere length and telomerase activity).
Transient introduction of miR-34a into HCC cell lines inhibited the telomerase activity
and telomere length, which induced senescence-like phenotypes and affected cellular
viability. We discovered that miR-34a potently targeted c-Myc and FoxM1, both of
which were involved in the activation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)
transcription, essential for the sustaining activity of telomerase to avoid senescence.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-34a functions as a potent tumor
suppressor through the modulation of telomere pathway in cellular senescence.

would undergo senescence, as significant barriers
to cancer formation. It was reported that hepatocyte
telomere shortening was accelerated in patients with
chronic liver disease, accompanied with increased
number of β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal)-positive cells, a
marker of senescence [8]. On the contrary, reactivation of
telomerase, which is critical for maintenance of telomere
length, is one of important features in most human cancers
[9]. Telomerase expression would greatly enhance the
transformation of liver cells, while telomerase deletion
limits the progression of p53-mutant HCCs with short
telomeres [10, 11]. Thus, telomere and telomerase-based
therapy to induce cellular senescence in cancer was
supposed to be a promising anti-tumor method [12].
miRNA consists of 22 nucleotides and regulates
gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner by
pairing with complementary nucleotide sequences in the 3’
untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs [13]. Since
miRNAs regulate a variety of genes pivotal for senescence

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, is rarely
detected early and is usually fatal within the months after
diagnosis [1]. Despite the extensive investigation of the
disease in the past years, its molecular mechanism still
remains elusive [2]. Recent studies indicate that cancer
cell senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest, is
a potential mechanism of HCC regression following
chemotherapy [3]. It was found that TGF-β-induced
senescence was associated with strong treatment response
against HCC [4]. Additionally, our previous results also
demonstrated that cellular senescence would contribute to
the chemotherapy response among HCC patients [5, 6].
Cellular senescence can be triggered by different
mechanisms including telomere shortening, epigenetic
derepression of INK4a/ARF locus, and DNA damage
[7]. In liver, hepatocytes exhibiting telomere dysfunction

(r = –0.236, P < 0.05), suggesting some connections of
these markers in the prognosis of HCC patients. However,
the correlations between miR-34a and other tumor index
such as tumor size (r = –0.05, P > 0.05) and TNM staging
(r = –0.094, P > 0.05) fail to reach statistical significance.

and apoptosis, they can function as tumor suppressors or
oncogenes, depending on the involvement of specific
target genes in tumorigenesis [14]. In this respect, the
miRNAs targeting telomerase directly or indirectly, might
serve as tumor suppressive genes in cellular processes,
such as let-7g, miR-138, miR-1207 and miR-1266,
which induced tumor senescence and death eventually
[15–17]. Recently, the miR-34 family (a, b and c) has
gained attention as they were identified as p53 targets and
regulate p53-mediated cycle arrest and apoptosis [18].
The miR-34 family is frequently downregulated in cancer
partly due to the inactivation of p53 [19]. Previous reports
showed that miR-34-induced senescence in cancer cell is
all in the form of telomere-independent cell cycle arrest.
Until recently, it was unknown whether miR-34 family
could induce cellular senescence in HCC in a telomeredependent way.
In the present study, we provided evidence that
miR-34a, the novel prognostic marker in cancer, regulated
senescence and viability in HCC tissues and cell lines,
at least, by targeting the FoxM1 and c-Myc gene, in the
telomere pathway.

Correlation of miR-34 family levels with
telomerase activity
Previous studies demonstrated that miR-34 family
could induce cellular senescence by participating in
cell cycle arrest. However, they were mainly focused
on the p53/p21 or p16/Rb senescence pathway, and
little is known about the telomere mechanism. Thus, by
computing the correlation coefficient using the NCI-60
expression profiling  data, we quantified the correlation
strength between miR-34 familiy and telomerase reverse
transcriptase (hTERT) expression profile in different cancer
cell lines (except neurologic cancer cells). As shown in
Figure 2A–2B, only miR-34a is inversely correlated with
the telomerase activity (P < 0.05), indicating the potential
regulating roles of miR-34a in telomerase activity. We then
examined the relationship between miR-34 family and
telomerase activity in 75 HCC samples by qRT-PCR. As
shown in Figure 2C, the hTERT mRNA expression appears
to be inversely correlated with the levels of miR-34a
(P < 0.05), which is consistent with the NCI-60 data.

RESULTS
miR-34 family expression is associated with
malignant characteristics in patients with HCC
To gain insight into the biological role of miR-34
family in human HCC development, we examined the
expression levels of miR-34 family in 75 paired HCC
samples by qRT-PCR. Our data showed that miR-34a,
miR-34b and miR-34c were underexpressed in more than
half HCC samples compared with the adjacent tissues,
suggesting that down-regulation of miR-34 famlily might
be involved in the hepatic carcinogenesis (P < 0.05,
Figure 1A–1B).
To further explore the potential roles of miR34 family in affecting malignant characteristics, the
expression levels of miR-34 family in tumor tissues were
used to build a signature of prognosis. For each miRNA
analysis, the patients were classified as the higher miRNA
expression group or the lower group by the median value
as the cutoff point. Kaplan–Meier curves showed that
patients with underexpressed miR-34a and miR-34b had
poorer overall survival and higher recurrence rates than
those with higher expression (P < 0.05), whereas no
substantial difference was observed for miR-34c (P >
0.05, Figure 1C–1D). In addition, this relationship was
also verified by the multivariate Cox regression analysis,
which demonstrates that both miR-34a and miR-34b could
be independent prognostic factors for the overall survival
and recurrence in HCC patients underwent surgical
resection (Table 1).
In the correlation analysis, the miR-34a level
was showed to be negatively correlated with AFP level

miR-34a inhibits telomerase activity and induces
telomere shortening
Subsequently, we tested whether miR-34a had an
effect on telomerase activity and telomere length in vitro.
Of different liver cancer cell lines, HepG2, SMMC-7721,
HHCC, and SK-Hep-1 cells were transiently transfected
with a synthetic miR-34a duplex (miR-34a mimic), or an
oligonucleotide complementary to the miR-34a sequence
to block its function (anti-miR-34a), or negative control
scrambled siRNA (control mimics and control inhibitor).
After 48 hours, the expression level of miR-34a was
significantly upregulated when transfected with synthetic
miR-34a duplex (Figure 3A). Results showed that
compared with negative control cells, ectopic expression
of miR-34a significantly inhibited telomerase activity and
induced telomere shortening, as represented by hTERT
mRNA expression and relative T/S ratio (telomere to
single copy gene), respectively (Figure 3B–3C).
Our finding that miR-34a regulates telomere
length and telomerase expression prompted us to further
investigate the pro-senescent effect of miR-34a in HCC.
We observed that introduction of miR-34a into liver
cancer cells caused senescence-like phenotypes, with
positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase
(SA β-gal) and enlarged cellular size (Figure 3D–3E). The
cellular senescence caused by miR-34a also resulted in
remarkable inhibition of cell proliferation, as represented

transfection of miR-34a duplex (miR-34a) in cancer cell
lines, we found that miR-34a reduced the protein levels
of c-Myc and FoxM1 significantly (Figure 4C, 4F).
Furthermore, to verify the idea that miR-34a represses
FoxM1 and c-Myc through these sites, we generated
luciferase reporter constructs, in which the miR-34a
seed target or the specific 3’-UTR is placed behind the
luciferase gene. Our results showed that miR-34a inhibited
luciferase activity significantly, whereas no effect was
observed when their respective target sites were mutated,
suggesting that miR-34a directly targets c-Myc and
FoxM1 via binding to the 3’ UTRs in liver cancer cells
(Figure 4D, 4G).

miR-34a targets c-Myc and FoxM1
Our above data showed that miR-34a inhibited the
expression and activity of telomerase significantly. Next
we sought to find out the molecular mechanism by which
miR-34a regulates telomerase expression. It is known
that hTERT expression can be activated by numerous
transcription factors [20]. Thus we wondered whether
miR-34a could affect any of the transcriptional factor
expression. Mir-34a was transfected to several HCC
cell lines and expression of the transcriptional factors
was examined by qRT-PCR analysis. The data showed
that among the hTERT activators examined, FoxM1 and
c-Myc were the most down-regulated genes by miR-34a
overexpression (Figure 4A). By target prediction, it turned
out that FoxM1 and c-Myc have predicted binding sites
for miR-34a in their 3’ UTRs (Figure 4B, 4E). With the

further investigated whether miR-34a inhibits telomerase

we also tried to verify this relationship in regulating

in Figure 5A–5B, the effect of c-Myc overexpression
rescued the FoxM1-mediated inhibition of hTERT, as

c-Myc as one of the most important downstream
factors of FoxM1. As altered expression of miR-34a

we discovered similar effects of miR-34a mimics and
FoxM1 siRNA on the hTERT expression, with possible
synergistic effect when transfected together, as revealed
by qRT-PCR and western blot (Figure 5C–5D). With no
surprise, similar effects were also observed for miR34a mimics and c-Myc siRNA (Figure 5E–5F). Taken
together, these results suggested that miR-34a inhibits
telomerase activity significantly, probably via the
FoxM1/c-Myc signal pathway.

evidences for the HCC treatment by enforced expression
of the lentivirus-based miR-34a.
Recently, altered expression of microRNA
genes has been reported to impact carcinogenesis [22].
Comparatively low levels of miR-34a expression were
demonstrated in several types of cancers [23, 24].
However, discrepancies emerged when we focused on
the miR-34a level in HCC. The expression of miR-34a
was firstly reported to be down-regulated in rat during
hepatocarcinogenesis induced by a methyl-deficient diet
[25]. Contradictorily, other reports showd that miR-34a
was also up-regulated in the HCCs in a chemical-induced
HCC model [26]. Thus, we speculate that miR-34a might
play varied roles during the carcinogenesis of HCCs
caused by different mechanisms. In human HCCs, Li et al.
previously reported that miR-34a was down-regulated in
19 of 25 (76%) human HCC tissues. Consistent with this
result, we discovered that the expression of miR-34a was
reduced in 52 of 75 (69%) human HCC tissues compared
with the adjacent tissues. Furthermore, in our study, the
down-regulated miR-34a level was demonstrated to
be correlated with tumor malignant features and poor
prognosis. Since the same chromosome 1p36 region,
which is the tumor suppressor candidate, is also frequently
deleted in cancer, thus the down-regulation of miR34a could be partially due to the deletion of 1p36 [27].
However, with respect to the up-regulated miR-34a level,
there might be alternative mechanisms that remain to be
identified.
The association between miR-34a and senescence
has been widely studied. By analyzing nutlin-3a-treated
cells, Kumamoto et al. firstly demonstrated that miR-34
family was involved in the p53-dependent senescence
pathway [28]. As well as transcriptionally regulated by
p53, Christoffersen et al. reported that miR-34a was also
regulated independently of p53 during oncogene-induced
senescence [29]. In addition, they identified the c-Myc as
target of miR-34a, which was consistent with our result.
Recently, Bai et al. suggested that miR-34a promoted renal
senescence by suppressing mitochondrial antioxidative
enzymes with a concomitant increase in reactive
oxygen species (ROS), providing a new mechanism of
senescence pathway by miR-34a [30]. However, so far all
the reported examples of senescence induction by miR34a are telomere-independent [31, 32]. Although Jin et
al. suggested that miR-34a might regulate the telomere
length by targeting PNUTS, the specific mechanism
still remains elusive [33]. Until recently, it was unclear
whether replicative senescence could also be induced in
cancer. In this study, we found that miR-34a might induce
senescence in HCC via the modulation of telomerase
activity, providing new insights into the mechanism
underlying HCC senescence.
When focusing on the genes potentially affect
telomerase activity, we identified FoxM1 and c-Myc as

data (P < 0.05), indicating that p53 might regulate the
miR-34a function in cellular senescence. To further verify
this hypothesis, we then examined the p53 and miR-34a
expression in four liver cancer cells by qRT-PCR and
western blot. As shown in Figure 6B–6C, the miR-34a
expression positively correlated with the p53 level (P <
0.05), which was consistent with the NCI-60 data.
As H2O2 and cisplatin induce a senescence-like
phenotype in cancer cells by activating p53, we used
them to induce senescent cells in our liver cancer lines. To
our expectation, the p53 protein expression significantly
increased after treatment with H2O2 or cisplatin in the wildtype p53 cells and the levels of miR-34a also increased
accordingly (Figure 6D–6E). However, in either the p53
mutant Huh-7 cells or the p53 deficient Hep3B cells, there
is no change in either p53 or miR-34a after treatment
with H2O2 or cisplatin (Figure 6D–6E). Further, when
endogenous p53 expression was knocked down by a p53
siRNA in the four p53 wild-type liver cancer cells, miR-34a
expression was also attenuated (Figure 6F). Subsequently,
western blot also confirmed that the levels of FoxM1, c-Myc
and hTERT were decreased after treatment with TP53
siRNA, indicating that the miR-34a induced senescence
is probably regulated by p53 (Figure 6G). Meanwhile,
results from the qRT-PCR and SA-β-gal staining suggested
that the overexpression of miR-34a is able to rescue the
siRNA-TP53-mediated hTERT activation and senescence
inhibition, further demonstrating the regulatory roles of p53
in miR-34a-induced senescence (Figure 6H–6I).

Administration of miR-34a with lentivirus induces
senescence-associated growth arrest in vivo
Subcutaneous administration of miR-34a caused
significant suppression of tumor growth of both HHCC
and 7721 cells (Figure 7). The average tumor volume was
decreased significantly with the administration of miR34a, compared with those administered by control miRNA
(Figure 7A). In addition, tumor tissues treated with miR34a showed a significantly decreased immunostaining of
Ki67 and PCNA, suggesting the in vivo anti-proliferation
effect of miR-34a (Figure 7B–7C). Consistent with the in
vitro assay, we found that miR-34a significantly reduced
the protein levels of c-Myc and FoxM1 in the tumors
(Figure 7D–7E). In the end, telomere length was assessed
in tumor tissues by qRT-PCR at 8 days after lentiviral
infection. Results showed that miR-34a shortened
telomere length significantly, suggesting the miR-34ainduced tumor growth arrest was probably due to the
telomere-associated senescence (Figure 7F).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report for the first time
that miR-34a induces telomere-dependent senescence in
HCC cells via targeting FoxM1/c-Myc pathway, which is

targets of miR-34a. c-Myc was reported to have direct
roles in the induction of telomerase activity, in which it
preserves chromosome integrity by maintaining telomere
length [34]. Nakamura et al. reported that c-Myc activates
telomerase by inducing expression of its catalytic subunit,
TERT, as the promoter of TERT contains numerous

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

c-Myc-binding sites that mediate transcriptional activation
[35]. On the other hand, FoxM1, the upstream regulators
of c-Myc, was also shown to potentially affect the
telomerase activity, as TERT was found to be inhibited in
the FoxM1-depleted cells [21, 36]. These evidence suggest
that by targeting FoxM1/c-Myc pathway, miR-34a might

activity, telomere length, and the subsequent cellular
senescence.
DNA damage is one of the common pathways in the
generation of senescence, whether induced by telomere
dysfunction, oncogene activation, or reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation [37]. As a major element in
the DNA damage-induced senescence, p53 inactivation was
characterized in most HCC. Previous reports studying p53
and its main target p21Cip1, which were involved in the
activation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) to
induce permanent cell cycle arrest, were the main focus of
extensive research leading to the recognition of senescence
in cancer. However, in this study, we showed that miR34a, which was also regulated by p53, induced telomerase
activity by targeting FoxM1/c-Myc pathway, for the first
time to demonstrate miR-34a as a bridge between p53 and
telomere-dependent pathways in senescence.
Wierstra I et al. first reported that FoxM1c
transactivates the human c-Myc promoter via both its P1
and P2 TATA box [21]. On the contrary, FoxM1 was also
predicted bioinformatically to be the genomic target of
c-Myc, and verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay [38]. In addition, Blanco-Bose et al. also reported
that c-Myc binds to a conserved E-box in the promoter of
FoxM1 depending on specific treatment [39]. Thus, the
specific interaction between FoxM1 and c-Myc needs firther

confirmation in future. In this study, we clearly demonstrate
that miR-34a suppresses the expression of FoxM1 and
c-Myc, which activates telomerase activity and extends
telomere length, providing a rationale for the accelerated
senescence by miR-34a in cancer cells (Figure 8A–8B).
In conclusion, given a critical role for senescence
induction in tumor suppression and cancer treatment, our
present findings have significant clinical implications.
Our data demonstrate that upregulation of miR-34a would
induce cellular senescence and growth arrest in human
HCC. This novel miR-34a-mediated mechanism offers a
new potential strategy for cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and human samples
Human HCC cell lines HepG2, SMMC-7721,
HHCC, SK-Hep-1, Hep3B and Huh-7 were were obtained
from Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Human
HCC liver samples were collected at the time of surgical
resection at the first affiliated hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong
University (Xi’an, China), from 2008 to 2013. Samples
were either immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at –80°C or fixed in 10% formalin for paraffin

Figure 8: Overview of telomere related pathways for miR-34a-induced senescence. In normal cells, the miR-34a activated by
p53 would target FoxM1 and c-Myc expression, resulting in the inactivation of telomerase and the subsequent telomere length shortening.
In contrast, in HCC cells with p53 inactivation, the suppressive miR-34a was unable to inhibit FoxM1 or c-Myc expression, leading to the
sustained activation of telomerase and the subsequent telomere length maintenance.

the Institutional Review Board of the Xi’an Jiaotong
University, and written informed consent was obtained
from each patient.
NCI-60 is a dataset of gene expression profiles
of 60 National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer cell lines.
These 60 human cancer cell lines are derived from
patients with leukaemia, melanoma, along with, lung,
colon, central nervous system, ovarian, renal, breast
and prostate cancers. Gene expression (GSE32474) and
miRNA expression (GSE26375) data were obtained from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Expression correlation
between miR-34 family and hTERT or TP53 expression
profile were analyzed using those two database. The p53
wild type and inconclusive cell lines was distinguished
from the mutation type by the database website (p53.free.
fr/Database/Cancer_cell_lines/HCC.html).

per site bilaterally on the backs of nude mice aged 6 weeks.
Lentiviral constructs containing pre-miR-34a (LV-miR-34a)
was purchased from GeneChem (Shanghai, China). As a
control, we also generated a lentiviral vector that expressed
green fluorescent protein alone (LV-GFP). Once the tumor
size reached ~50 mm3, mice were treated with intratumoral
injections (at days 0) of 1 × 107 pfu/ml of the LV-miR-34a
or LV-control lentivirus construction on each side. Tumor
size was monitored by measuring the length and width with
calipers, and volumes were calculated with the formula:
(L × W2) × 0.5, where L is length and W is width of each
tumor.

Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase
chain reaction (qRT–PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the liver samples
or cultured cells using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. qRT-PCR
was performed using the SYBR® PrimeScriptTM miRNA
RT-PCR Kit and SYBR® Premix Ex TaqTM (TaKaRa
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The mRNA expression
was assayed in triplicate and normalized to different
reference genes, such as the GAPDH, U6 (miR-34a). The
relative levels were calculated using the Comparative-Ct
method (∆∆Ct method). All primer pairs were synthesized
by TaKaRa.

Immunohistochemical staining
For immunohistochemical assay, slides were
incubated with biotin-label goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
IgG, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to label
streptavidin. The intensity of immunohistochemical
staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate
strong) or 3 (strong). The extent of staining was assessed
based on the percentage of positive cancer cells: 0
(negative), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (51–75%), and 4
(76–100%). The final staining score was the mean of the
sum of the intensity and extent scores from three fields.
The expression was considered as low if the final score
was 1–5 and as high if the final score was 6–12.

Measurement of telomerase activity
As hTERT expression was reported to be a more
sensitive marker of telomerase activity than the assessment
by telomerase repeat-amplification protocol (TRAP) assay,
and hTERT expression is a rate-limiting determinant of
the enzymatic activity, thus we analyzed the expression of
hTERT mRNA to investigate the telomerase activity. The
qRT-PCR was performed as mentioned above.

Cell culture and transient transfection
Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
heat-inactivated 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at
37°C in 5% CO2. The miRNA mimics were synthesized by
GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The transfection of miR34a duplex oligoribonucleotides (sense, 5′-UGG CAG UGU
CUU AGC UGG UUG UU-3′; antisense 5′-CAA CCA
GCU AAG ACA CUG CGA AA-3′), mimics control (sense,
5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UTT-3′; antisense,
5′-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA ATT-3′), inhibitor
anti-miR-34a (5′-ACA ACC AGC UAA GAC ACU GCC
A-3′), and inhibitor control (5′-CAG UAC UUU UGU
GUA GUA CAA-3′) were performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
procedure recommended by the manufacturer.

DNA extraction and measurement of telomere
length
Genomic DNA was isolated from liver tissues using
Tiangen DNA isolation kit (Tiangen biotech, Beijing,
China). Relative mean telomere length was measured by
qRT-PCR measurement of the ratio of telomere repeat
units (Tel) to a single-copy gene (CON), as described
previously [40]. In brief, each sample was amplified for
telomeric DNA and for human β2-globulin (HBG), a
single-copy control gene that provides an internal control
to normalize the starting amount of DNA.
