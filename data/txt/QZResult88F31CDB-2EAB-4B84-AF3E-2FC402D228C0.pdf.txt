Abstract
Met receptor tyrosine kinase was discovered in 1984 as an oncogene. Thirty years later, Met and its ligand
hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor are promising targets for the novel therapies developed to ﬁght against
cancers, with more than 240 clinical trials currently conducted. In this review, we offer to trace and highlight the
most recent ﬁndings of the exemplary track record of research on Met receptor, which allowed moving this
biomarker from bench to bedside. Indeed, three decades of basic research unravelled the structural basis of the
ligand/receptor interaction and their complex downstream signaling network. During this period, animal models
highlighted their crucial role in the development and homeostasis of epithelial organs. In parallel, involvement of
Met in tumorigenesis was conﬁrmed by the direct association of its deregulation to poor prognosis in numerous
cancers. On the basis of these data, pharmaceutical companies developed many Met inhibitors, some of which are in
phase III clinical trials. These impressive achievements should not detract from many questions that still remain,
such as the precise Met signaling involvement in development or homeostasis of speciﬁc epithelial structures.
In addition, the processes involving Met in resistance to current therapies or the appearance of resistances to
Met-targeted therapies are far from being fully understood. Cancer Res; 74(23); 6737–44. 2014 AACR.

Many phases II and III clinical trials are evaluating targeted therapies against Met in various types of carcinomas.
It seems obvious nowadays that Met, like other receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK), is a promising target in our ﬁght
against cancers. However, a long way of basic and applied
research was necessary to place this RTK as a druggable
actor of tumorigenesis. These multiple discoveries can be
divided into three main steps: (i) Met physiologic role and its
downstream signaling pathways, (ii) its involvement in
tumorigenesis, and (iii) the design and evaluation of the
targeted therapies against it.

Step 1: Met Physiologic Role and Its Downstream
Signaling Pathways
Discovery of HGF/SF and Met
The Met receptor and the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
its high afﬁnity ligand, were both discovered in 1984. Met was
characterized from the TPR-Met oncogene in the human
osteosarcoma cell line HOS treated by a carcinogen. This fusion
protein results from the rearrangement between the tpr
gene and a novel gene, met, named in reference to the carcinogen used, the N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (1). The

TPR part of fusion proteins induces their constitutive dimerization and thus activation of Met kinase domain, resulting in
transforming activity. The HGF was isolated from the plasma of
rats as a mitogen for cultured hepatocytes (2). Three years later,
Stoker and colleagues identiﬁed a factor inducing epithelial
cells scattering in ﬁbroblast conditioned media so-called scatter factor (SF; ref. 3). In 1991, HGF and SF were recognized as
the same protein encoded by the same gene and inducing
similar biologic responses through binding to the Met receptor
(4).
HGF/SF is synthesized as an inactive pro-HGF maturated by
a proteolytic cleavage, leading to generation of an active
90-kDa heterodimer consisting of an a and a b subunit bound
by disulﬁde bridges. The a subunit includes an N-terminal (N)
and four kringle (K1-K4) domains when the b subunit consists
of a serine protease homology (SPH) domain. Although SPH
domain lacks enzymatic activity, a zymogen activator peptide
selectively able to bind the activation pocket within the serine
protease–like b-chain induces activation of pro-HGF–dependent Met signaling, suggesting that the protease-like structure
of HGF/SF plays a crucial role in its activation (5). Met is
synthesized as a 170-kDa precursor matured into a heterodimeric receptor composed of an extracellular a subunit
linked to a single-pass transmembrane b subunit by a disulﬁde
bond. The extracellular part of Met contains a N-terminal
SEMA domain (also found in semaphorins, axon guidance
proteins) encompassing the a subunit and the ﬁrst amino
acids of the b subunit, followed by a PSI domain (named from
its presence in plexins, semaphorins, and integrins) and four
immunoglobulin-like domains called IPTs (Fig. 1A). The crystal
structure of Met extracellular region, resolved in 2003, showed
the SEMA domain organized in a seven bladed b-propeller

Met from Bench to Bedside

followed by stalk shaped PSI and IPT domains (6). The intracellular region contains the tyrosine kinase domain and a
C-terminal tail necessary to recruit signaling proteins following
Met activation by HGF/SF binding (7).
Met has two binding sites for HGF/SF: the IPT3 and IPT4
domains bind the N domain of HGF/SF and the SEMA domain
binds SPH domain of HGF/SF. HGF/SF dimerizes via top and
tail interactions of N and K1 domains, resulting in Met dimerization (Fig. 1B; ref. 8). HGF/SF can also bind to sulphate
glycoproteins, like heparins, which improve its oligomerization
and thus Met dimerization.

impaired migration of myogenic precursors. In the last few
years, conditional Met knockout provided additional information about its role in the formation of individual structures.
Thus, Met invalidation in lung severely impairs formation of
airspaces (12), and its extinction in central nervous system
induces loss of motor neurons innervating pectoral muscles
(Fig. 1C and D; ref. 13). In adult, Met is crucial for epithelial
tissue homeostasis as conditional Met invalidation impairs
regeneration of liver, kidney, or skin (14). On the contrary,
injury of kidney, spinal cord, or liver is followed by a rise in
HGF/SF and its ectopic addition favors their regeneration.

HGF/SF-Met involvement in development and tissue
homeostasis
Upon HGF/SF binding, Met can induce various biologic
responses, including proliferation and motility, at the origin
of their discovery, but also, survival, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, or neurite growth. All these effects are consistent with
their role in vivo. Indeed, description of HGF/SF and Met
expression patterns suggested from early 1990s their importance in formation and homeostasis of numerous tissues. At
the early stages of development, HGF/SF and Met display a
concomitant expression in endoderm and mesoderm and
likely act in an autocrine fashion. From organogenesis, Met
is detected in epithelial cells of many organs (liver, kidney, lung,
skin), whereas HGF/SF is expressed by adjacent mesenchymal
cells. This complementary expression suggests that HGF/SF
contributes in a paracrine fashion to the development of
epithelial organs (9). Besides, Met is expressed in some myoblasts and neuronal precursors, suggesting a role in setting of
muscular and nervous structures as well.
During the same decade, knockout mice conﬁrmed HGF/SF
and Met crucial role in embryogenesis, as met and hgf/sf-null
mice die in utero at E15 and express similar phenotypes,
conﬁrming their functional link. Organization defect of the
placental labyrinth, responsible for impaired exchanges
between maternal and fetal blood, explains such lethality
(10, 11). Embryos also display reduced liver size, a consequence
of decreased cell survival and proliferation and a lack of
muscles in limbs, diaphragm, and tongue resulting from the

Met and downstream signaling pathways' activation
Met receptor signaling began to be described from the early
1990s, shortly after its identiﬁcation as the receptor for HGF/
SF. Met interaction with its ligand favors its dimerization and
its autophosphorylation on two tyrosine residues in its catalytic domain (Y1234 et 1235). Other tyrosine residues located
outside the kinase domain are then phosphorylated, notably
tyrosine 1003 in the juxtamembrane domain and tyrosines
1349 et 1356 at the C-terminal tail. Those latter residues are
able to bind many effectors, such as Gab1, Grb2, Shc, PI3K, Src,
STAT3 or PLCg. This multisubstrate docking site plays a key
role in Met-induced biologic responses, as its mutation in mice
triggers phenotypes similar to those of Met-deﬁcient mice (15).
Following the recruitment of these various adaptors by Met,
several signaling cascades will be triggered via other downstream proteins, which can be associated to biologic responses.
For instance, small G proteins such as Ras, Rac, p21-activated
kinase (PAK), and RAP1 control the cytoskeletal rearrangement and motility in response to HGF/SF (16). With regard to
PI3K, its activation is involved in motility and also plays a key
role in cell survival via Akt activation (17). Met is also able to
orientate p53 activity toward survival via a cascade implying
Abl and p38–MAPK (18).
Met internalization and cleavages: beyond degradation
Since 2000, various mechanisms negatively regulating Met
have been evidenced. Met autophosphorylation on Y1003
leads to Cbl E3 Ubiquitin ligase recruitment and to Met

Figure 1. Timeline of the main discoveries on Met receptor from1984 to nowadays. We describe here several milestones that allow the research on Met receptor
to move from bench to bedside from 1984 to nowadays. We divided them into three parts: the physiologic role and signaling pathway downstream of Met (pink
background color); Met involvement in tumorigenesis (green background color); and the design and evaluation of Met-targeted therapies (blue background
color). A, the Met receptor is constituted by a and b chains linked by a disulﬁde bridge. The extracellular part is composed of the SEMA domain shared between
the two chains, a PSI domain (plexins, semaphorins, and integrins) and four IPT domains (immunoglobin-like fold shared by plexins and transcription factors).
B, the crystal structure of the Met SEMA domain with its ligand revealed that two HGF/SF molecules interact via their N and K1 domains associated head to tail.
Each molecule of HGF/SF interacts with one SEMA domain via a type 2:2 interaction (two receptors for two ligands; ref. 8). C, the importance of HGF/SF and
Met during embryonic development and in adult has been shown through inactivation of their genes in mice. Conditional extinction of Met in nervous
system prevents survival of a motoneurons subgroup innervating the pectoralis minor muscle, leading to motor defects (13). D, Met invalidation in lung
severely impairs airspaces formation (12). E, FISH MET/CEP7 (Zytovision Dual Color; Zytolight SPEC MET/CEN7). Invasive adenocarcinoma of acinar type

H, inhibition strategies against Met aim at interfering with HGF/SF–Met interaction or with Met tyrosine kinase activity. Inhibitors of the ligand–receptor
interaction are blocking antibodies directed against HGF/SF or Met extracellular region, or antagonists able to bind Met without activating it, such as
HGF/SF subdomain derived from natural variant NK2 or subdomains of Met used as decoy against HGF/SF. The TKIs are mainly ATP mimetics able to occupy
Met ATP pocket to inhibit its activity.

ubiquitinylation. Met receptor is then internalized and
degraded (19). Y1003 mutation promotes Met activation and
transforming capacities, highlighting the importance of this
attenuation process.
Other negative regulation sites lie in the juxtamembrane
domain, such as Serine 983, whose phosphorylation by protein
kinase C downregulates Met activity (20). This domain also
contains several cleavage sites by proteases. In absence of its
ligand and under stress conditions, Met is thus cleaved by
caspases into an active fragment able to amplify cell death by
favoring mitochondrial permeabilization (21). Via this proapoptotic potential opposed to its antiapoptotic activities in
response to its ligand, Met belongs to the dependence receptor
family. Met is also submitted to a constitutive cleavage in its
extracellular domain by ADAM family metalloproteinases,
followed by a second cleavage by g-secretase in its juxtamembrane domain (22). The so-created intracellular fragments then
undergo proteasomal and lysosomal degradations, which participate in the regulation of the receptor half-life.
Met internalization is not only synonymous of degradation
but also actively participates in its signaling. Indeed, along its
trafﬁcking from early to perinuclear endosomes, Met colocalizes with STAT3 transcription factor and allows its proper
nuclear translocation and transcriptional activities, involved in
Met-induced morphogenesis and cellular transformation (23).
Met social network
During the last decade, Met unveiled to us its multiple
partners at the plasma membrane, required for an efﬁcient
activation of signaling pathways. Met interaction with a6b4
integrin is thus important for cellular invasion in response to
HGF/SF (24). Met can also associate with a3b1 integrin, which
contributes to Gab1 and PI3K recruitment and results in the
control of the Wnt pathway (25). CD44v6 isoform interaction
with Met not only promotes HGF-induced Met phosphorylation but also a more efﬁcient activation of the Ras–MAPK
pathway via the association between CD44v6 intracellular part
and ERM proteins (Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin; ref. 26). On the
other side, the interaction of Met with plexin-type receptors
favors invasion or angiogenesis induced by semaphorin 4D or
5A, respectively (27). Recently, it has been shown that activated
Met/tensin-4 interaction favors receptor stability and downstream signaling. Their correlated expression in colon and
ovarian carcinoma suggests that TNS4 plays a critical role in
Met stability in these cancers (28). Met can also hold a dialogue
with other RTKs, such as EGFR, which is especially relevant in
tumor cells; this notion will be developed later in this review.
Altogether, these data highlight how Met action is highly
dependent on its relationships with other membrane partners,
and such interactions should probably be taken into account
when elaborating Met-targeting therapies.

Step 2: Met Involvement in Tumorigenesis
HGF/SF-Met abilities to induce proliferation, protection
from apoptosis, angiogenesis, and motility are nothing better
than many properties potentially contributing to tumorigenesis. Met oncogenic role was initially evidenced in experimen-

6740

tal systems, starting from Met discovery in a screening for
cellular transformation. The formal link between Met aberrant
activation and cancer development in humans was established
a bit more than a decade later, with the identiﬁcation of Met
mutations associated with hereditary renal papillary carcinomas (29). Since then, more than 150 somatic point mutations in
met sequence have been evidenced in various cancers (source:
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer). Some of these
mutations activate the kinase domain, favor its ligand-induced
activation or induce Met recycling at the membrane (30).
Consistently, transgenic mice harboring Met mutations in the
kinase domain develop several types of cancers (lymphomas,
carcinomas, and sarcomas; ref. 31).
Met overexpression is also detected in various cancers
and can affect up to 80% of patients suffering from gastric or
renal cancers and usually correlates with a poor prognosis (32).
Many mechanisms can be involved in Met overexpression.
Beyond gene ampliﬁcation, several oncogenes such as Ras,
Ets-1, or Pax-5 increase Met transcription (Fig. 1E and F; refs. 33,
34). Met expression is also repressed by miRNAs such as
miR34b, which is controlled by p53 and could link p53 inactivation frequently found in cancers with Met overexpression.
Met aberrant activation can also result from an overexpression of its ligand HGF/SF, which was notably observed in
breast, gastric, colon, or lung cancers and associated with a
poor prognosis (35). Moreover, recent studies have highlighted
a key role for HGF/SF secreted from the tumor microenvironment in the development of drug resistance, especially to RAF
inhibitors (36).
Last but not least, with regard to anticancerous therapies,
Met overexpression has been observed in response to EGFRtargeting drugs, such as geﬁtinib in lung cancers (37) or
cetuximab in colorectal cancers (38). The activation by Met
of downstream signaling pathways actually allows to compensate for EGFR inhibition, especially since signaling networks
controlled by EGFR and Met display many similarities. Thus,
HGF/SF-Met deregulation has demonstrated to play a key role
not only in the development of many cancers, but also in drug
resistance mechanisms implemented by tumor cells.

Step 3: Design and Evaluation of Targeted
Therapies against Met
Inhibition of the HGF/Met signaling pathway appeared as
an obvious therapeutic strategy since the beginning of 2000.
Preclinical experiments assessed the therapeutic potential of
two approaches that aimed at disturbing the physical interaction between the Met receptor and its HGF/SF ligand
using blocking antibodies or inhibiting the kinase activity of
the receptor using small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI; Fig. 1H). The level of conﬁdence placed by the pharmaceutical groups in these strategies is highlighted by
the number of clinical trials launched in these last years
with 95 trials registered in www.clinicalgov.com in 2011 to
more than 240 in 2014. These trials, mainly phase I/II,
evaluate the safety and therapeutic potential of 23 different
compounds and, interestingly, ﬁve compounds already made
it to a phase III trial.

Met from Bench to Bedside

Met inhibitors are essentially ATP mimetics that compete
with the ATP for access to the kinase-active site then blocking
the receptor activity. The ﬁrst developed Met inhibitor, K252a,
a staurosporine analogue, displays a weak selectivity as it
inhibits multiple kinases (39). It was rapidly replaced by more
speciﬁc ATP competitors such as PHA-665752 (40), still widely
used in basic research. Tivantinib is the sole Met-speciﬁc TKI
currently in phase III efﬁcacy evaluation. Although the ﬁrst
phase III trial was prematurely terminated in 2012 due to a lack
of clinical beneﬁt in patients with non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) compared with a tivantinib and erlotinib association
(EGFR-targeting TKI), an improvement of progression-free
survival of patients with Met-positive tumors was reached.
Therefore, additional phase III trials are ongoing taking into
account the Met expression status of the targeted tumors.
Other Met inhibitors with a broader spectrum of action are
in their later stage of drug development or even approved by
the drug regulatory authorities. For instance, crizotinib, an
inhibitor of Met, ALK, and ROS1 kinases was approved for
patients with NSCLC harboring ALK translocations. Its efﬁcacy
to inhibit multiple kinases is probably a major asset to prevent
the development of drug resistance particularly due to met
gene ampliﬁcation (41). Moreover, encouraging preliminary
results were obtained in patients with Met-positive gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, thus predicting a more extensive
clinical use of the TKI (42).
Development of monoclonal blocking antibodies, which
started in 1998, is another promising strategy to inhibit the
HGF/Met pathway. Directed against the ligand or the extracellular domain of the receptor, they prevent the HGF/Met
interaction. As an example, AMG102/rilotumumab, an antiHGF antibody, is under evaluation in a phase III trial for
patients with Met overexpression advanced gastric or esophageal junction carcinomas.
Against Met, the monoclonal humanized antibody MetMab/
onartuzumab was originally designed with only one arm to
prevent the receptor dimerization responsible for its autoactivation. Crystal structure revealed that onartuzumab binds
the Met SEMA domain, blocking the interaction with HGF/SF
a chain (43). Despite encouraging results obtained in preclinical xenograft models and in a phase II trial in NSCLC with an
onartuzumab plus erlotinib cotreatment (44), the clinical
future of the antibody is uncertain. Indeed, the phase III trial
for this cotreatment in patients with advanced NSCLC Metpositive was stopped prematurely for futility.
Interestingly, other monoclonal antibodies directed against
the extracellular domain of Met exert their inhibitory action
without interfering with the ligand–receptor interaction. DN30
monoclonal antibody, for example, favors Met degradation
in mouse models by activating Met cleavages by metalloproteases and g-secretase complex, thus reducing the tumor
growth (45, 46).
At a preclinical level, additional strategies to inhibit the
HGF/Met signaling are inspired from the natural HGF/SF
variant NK2, an antagonistic molecule capable of binding Met
without activating it (Fig. 1H). For instance, NK4 constructed
with the N and ﬁrst four K domains of HGF/SF, inhibits
tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in mouse models (47). Simi-

www.aacrjournals.org

larly, antagonistic molecules corresponding to Met extracellular region or to subdomains (i.e., SEMA), are developed to
generate an HGF/SF decoy (48).
Preclinical models already anticipate potential mechanisms
of resistance against Met-targeted therapies. An increased met
gene copy number has thus been highlighted in cancer cells
resistant to monovalent DN30 antibody (49), as well as met and
KRAS ampliﬁcation mediating acquired resistance to Met TKIs
(50). Another study has evidenced that activation of HER family
members allowed the resistance to PHA665752 (51), mirroring
the role of Met in the resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies,
probably due to the high similarity between signaling networks
downstream these receptors. Finally, in mice models and cell
cultures, acquired resistance to crizotinib involved a mutation
in the Met kinase activation loop, which could alter interaction
with the TKI (52). Two other key aspects to consider in the
emergence of cancer resistance to targeted therapies are the
preexistence and selection by the treatments of clones harboring gene ampliﬁcations (53) and the role of environmental
growth factors in innate and acquired resistance to kinase
inhibitors (54).
With this in mind, one can try to think about the last failures
of phase III clinical trials with Met-targeting agents, onartuzumab and tivantinib. Both treatments did not meet their
primary endpoint of increasing the overall survival of patients
with NSCLC in combination with erlotinib, although they had
shown strong efﬁciency in preclinical studies of mice xenografts with autocrine or paracrine HGF-Met stimulation loops.
One may ﬁrst reﬂect about the patients recruited in the trials,
which were in their second- or third-line of treatment, thus
meaning that previous treatments may have promoted the
emergence of resistant clones. New phase III trials are ongoing,
with tivantinib proposed in monotherapy as a second-line
treatment in hepatocellular carcinomas, and with onartuzumab  erlotinib as a ﬁrst-line treatment in NSCLCs, which may
improve their therapeutic efﬁcacy. Moreover, it has to be noted
that NSCLCs represent tumors in which Met is overexpressed
in nearly half of the patients as evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, this overexpression does not
necessarily mean that Met is activated in these tumors, thus
leading to an overestimation of likely responders. Met phosphorylation, notably in its kinase domain, better reﬂects Met
activation. Several speciﬁc antibodies recognizing Met tyrosine
phosphorylation can be used by IHC (Fig. 1G), and it has been
shown that only about 5% of the NSCLCs display Met tyrosine
phosphorylation while receptor overexpression is much higher
(55). Nevertheless, the stability of these phosphorylation sites
ex vivo may require particular care for a routine use in clinic.
HGF/SF status in human lung cancer patients represents
another key biologic feature that is so far not exploited but
should prove to be useful, especially for strategies aimed at
interfering with the ligand–receptor interaction. It has also
recently been evidenced that Met mutations in the exon 14 are
more frequent than originally thought in NSCLCs (56). The
impact of Met-targeted therapies on cells bearing this kind of
alteration has to be determined.
Results of ongoing clinical trials revealed this year at the
ASCO meeting suggest that met gene ampliﬁcation could be as

well a good predictive biomarker. Patients with NSCLC displaying met gene ampliﬁcation with a ratio of 5 or more met
gene copies per cell were thus prospectively selected for a
phase I clinical trial evaluating crizotinib (Met and ALK
inhibitor). Crizotinib induced an objective response rate in
about two thirds of this restricted subgroup (57). Similar
promising responses on met-ampliﬁed patients were reported
also for Met inhibitor AMG337 in gastric cancer (58). These
studies should be now strengthened from larger initial cohorts
to have more patients displaying met gene ampliﬁcation.
Altogether, these data suggest that selecting the right
patients is critical to get successful Met-targeted therapies.
A multiplexed molecular diagnostic of Met/HGF status may be
required to identify those tumors in which Met represents an
Achilles heel. From that point of view, the stratiﬁed analysis of
last phase III trials is expected with much impatience, to
understand whether Met status and accompanying genetic
alterations can retrospectively identify subpopulations responsive or refractory to such treatments. At the same time, we can
envision that different Met-targeted therapies may proﬁt to
distinct patient populations.

Perspectives
The question is frequently asked about the time necessary to
move a biomarker from bench to bedside. This time highly
depends on the nature of the target. Abl inhibition with drugs
such as Gleevec took four decades from the observation of
Philadelphia chromosome, the identiﬁcation of bcr-abl fusion
product in the early 1980s, to the development of clinical drugs
(for review, see ref. 59). The huge progresses made since then
in the ﬁeld of molecular biology should help fastening the
transition from bench to bedside. Anyhow, some promising
targets are still waiting for therapeutic drugs. For example,
Myc ubiquitous expression in most proliferating cells raise
toxicity issues, and strategies to disrupt Myc–Max interaction
are hindered by the large and relatively featureless surface of
interaction (for review, see ref. 60). In parallel, RAS mutations
in cancers were discovered nearly at the same time, as was Met,
but their therapeutic targeting was so far limited by the high
afﬁnity of GTP to RAS at picomolar levels. In contrast, ALK
rearrangements in NSCLCs beneﬁted from the previous clinical development of crizotinib as a Met inhibitor (but it also
inhibits ALK) to become biomarkers and targets of efﬁcient
crizotinib treatments only 3 years after their discovery.
For Met, 30 years separate its discovery in 1984 to the actual
promising clinical trials. In three decades, the signaling network required for embryonic development and epithelial
organs regeneration was ﬁnely decorticated. In parallel, Met

deregulation in tumorigenesis was fully demonstrated and
associated with a poor prognosis in numerous cancers
(www.vai.org/Met/). Then, pharmacologic inhibitors were rapidly designed and the ﬁrst administration to human began in
2005. Nowadays, two multiple TKIs are already prescribed and
a few Met-speciﬁc inhibitors are currently under clinical
testing. These impressive achievements should not, however,
detract from the work that still remains. Indeed, fundamental
research is still fuelling our knowledge of Met. For instance, the
importance of Met relationships with other membrane proteins has been again evidenced recently with the involvement
of tensin-4 in Met stabilization and transformation, or by the
"liaisons dangereuses" between Met and EGFR in lung cancers.
Moreover, even if Met role in development has been well
documented for almost 20 years, its involvement in lung
alveolar formation or in speciﬁc muscle innervation was
demonstrated only recently. The use of conditional animal
models will more than likely lead to the identiﬁcation of Met
participation to the development and cell homeostasis of other
organs.
With regard to signaling mechanisms, despite huge progresses made in the last decade, Met signaling networks are
still far from being fully elucidated in the various settings in
which Met is involved. Moreover, a new paradigm is emerging
with the identiﬁcation of distinct phenotypes elicited whether
Met is activated via its overexpression or by the binding of its
ligand (61). All these novel insights in Met action will probably
lead to a better understanding of Met complex activity in
cancers. This should help to reﬁne therapeutic strategies and
to overcome the development of resistance to Met targeting
agents, already illustrated in cellular models.
The combined efforts which have allowed moving Met from
the bench to the bedside in 30 years will now meet the
challenges of identifying the most efﬁcient therapeutic window
and limiting the development of resistance to Met-targeted
therapies.
