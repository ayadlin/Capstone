ABSTRACT
T2R38 belongs to the family of bitter receptors and was initially detected in
cells of the oral cavity. We now describe expression of T2R38 in tumor cells in
patients with pancreatic cancer and in tumor-derived cell lines. T2R38 is localized
predominantly intracellular in association with lipid droplets, particularly with the
lipid droplet membrane. The receptor can be activated by the bona fide ligand for
T2R38, phenylthiourea (PTU), and by N-acetyl-dodecanoyl homoserine (AHL-12), a
quorum sensing molecule of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter is the only known
natural ligand for T2R38. In response to PTU or AHL-12, key transcription factors
are activated including phosphorylation of the MAP kinases p38 and ERK1/2, and
upregulation of NFATc1. Moreover, we found increased expression of the multi-drug
resistance protein 1 (also known as ABCB1), a transmembrane transporter molecule,
participating in shuttling of a plethora of drugs, such as chemotherapeutics or
antibiotics. In conclusion, our data indicate a new, additional function of the taste
receptor T2R38 beyond sensing “bitter”. Moreover, because T2R38 can be stimulated
by a bacteria-derived signaling molecule the receptor could link microbiota and cancer.

INTRODUCTION

inflammation, or metabolic changes, which in turn might
promote cancer development [5, 6]. Interactions between
tumor cells and bacteria-derived substances are not well
understood, particularly in tissues lacking a microbiome,
such as the pancreas. In that context, we were interested
in receptors on tumor cells that recognize soluble, tissuepermeating bacteria-derived molecules. For the latter, we
chose the quorum sensing molecule N-acetyl-dodecanoylhomoserine lactone (AHL-12), which is produced and
released by Gram-negative bacteria as an interbacterial
signaling molecule, crucial for developing virulence
factors. AHL-12, however, signals also to a wide variety
of mammalian cells, including myeloid cells and epithelial
cells [7, 8]. Due to its lipophilic nature, AHL-12 diffuses
freely through membranes; more recently, however,
T2R38 was identified as receptor for AHL-12 on epithelial
cells and myeloid cells, linking T2R38 to the local host
response to bacterial infection [7-11].

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC;
pancreatic cancer) is a highly aggressive tumor with an
overall 5-years survival rate of approximately 5% [1].
Therapeutic options are rather limited, due to aggressive
and invasive growth, early metastasis, and resistance to
radiation and chemotherapy [2]. A characteristic feature
of PDAC is the extensive desmoplastic stroma and the
pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment [3]. The
link between this intratumor inflammation and cancer
progression is not yet understood. Alterations of the
cytokine profile of infiltrating immune cells are discussed
[4], and more recently also the role of the intestinal
microbiota [5, 6]. Although microbiota and host coexist in a more or less symbiotic relationship, alterations
within the microbiome or changes of life-style might
off-set this balance, leading to a local immune response,

T2R38 belongs to the family of bitter receptors,
originally identified on cells of the taste buds (reviewed in
[12-14]). In humans, the family comprises approximately
25 bitter receptors, encoded from 43 genes. Some of
the receptors can bind different structurally unrelated
compounds, for others the natural ligands have not yet
been identified [14, 15]. Of note, bitter receptors are also
expressed by cells that are not part of the gustatory system,
e.g. by airway epithelial cells, in the brain, ductal cells of
the pancreas, or enteroendocrine cells in the colon and by
myeloid cells [7, 8, 16-18]. Obviously, these receptors do
not participate in taste perception, and their responsiveness
to a wide variety of structurally unrelated substances,
including amino acids, peptides or sugars, imply other,

possibly regulatory, functions.
We now assessed expression of T2R38 in PDAC
tissue and on a variety of tumor cell lines and assessed its
biological function by use of AHL-12 as a natural ligand.

RESULTS
Expression of T2R38 in biopsies
Expression of T2R38 and association with lipid
droplets was examined in tissue derived from biopsies
of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Figure 1: Expression of T2R38 in pancreatic tumor tissue and association with lipid droplets. A.-D. Tissue biopsies of

PDAC are shown, stained for T2R38 (two different tumors; magnifications: A,B: 100x; C,D: 200x ) PDAC cells were positive for T2R38
(thick arrows), as were infiltrating immune cells (thin arrows). E., F. T2R38 positive tumor cells (thick arrows) at the invasive front of
the tumor in the duodenal wall (magnifications E: 200x; F: 400X). The gut lumen is marked by an asterisk. G. For comparison, a PDAC
biopsy negative for T2R38 is shown (still with scattered T2R38 positive infiltrating immune cells marked by thin arrow; tumor marked
by arrowhead; 200x), and in H. normal acinar pancreactic tissue, which is negative for T2R38 (200x). Panel I. shows infiltrating immune

In 69 of the 88 pancreatic cancer biopsies (78.4%)
T2R38 was seen in tumor cells. The T2R38 signal was
mainly located in the cytoplasm, and only rarely on the
membrane. Staining intensity of the tumor cells was
moderate, whereas the tumor infiltrating macrophages and
neutrophils stained more prominently. T2R38 could also
be detected at the invasive front of the tumor infiltrating
the duodenal wall at the interface to the duodenal lumen.
The surrounding normal tissue, mostly acinar cells, did
not express T2R38 (examples in Figure 1A-1H). Staining
intensity or frequency of T2R38 positive tumor cells did
not correlate with clinical or pathological parameters or
survival, nor did the number of infiltrating leukocytes.

In tumor cells and in leukocytes T2R38 was co-localized
with perilipin-2, which is an established marker for lipid
droplets (Figure 1I-1N).

Expression of T2R38 on tumors and tumor cell
lines
By cytofluorometry, expression of T2R38 was
tested on pancreas-derived cancer cells (SU8686, T3M4,
MiaPaCa-2), and for comparison on RLT (a pancreatic
stellate cell line), HuH7 (liver cancer cell line), and SKOV3 (ovarian cancer cell) (Figure 2A, 2B). In all, T2R38

T2R38 was tested on the cells lines indicated (left panels; the thick line shows antibody binding, the thin line the isotype control). Right
panels: To verify specificity of the antibody binding (thick line), the cells were preincubated with the corresponding antigen peptide (thin
line). B. Examples of the pancreatic cancer cells MiaPaCa-2, Su8686, T3M4 and the liver cancer cell line HuH7 are shown. C. By Western
blotting expression of T2R38 was tested in whole cells lysates of RLT, SKOV, and SU8686. The antibody sc-34294 reacted with multiple
proteins; inhibition by the antigenic peptide (34294p) revealed specific bands with an apparent molecular weight of 100 kDa and 38 kDa,
respectively (marked by arrows).

was present intracellular, whereas surface expression
was weak (HuH7, SU8686) or absent. Specificity of the
antibody reaction was confirmed by use of the antigenic
peptide, which greatly reduced the antibody binding (on
average: 57.7%; range: from 31.3% to 81.4%). Western
blot revealed numerous protein bands; two of which
could be inhibited by the antigenic peptide, indicating
specific reaction with a protein at 38 kDa protein, which
corresponds to the expected size. In addition, a 100 kDa
form of T2R38 was found (Figure 2C). The latter is in line
with published data, and is thought to represent a posttranslationally modified form [7, 19].

patients with pancreatic cancer. Tumor cells expressed
T2R38, but also the infiltrated leukocytes in the tumor
microenvironment, whereas the surrounding normal
pancreatic acinar cells were negative. Neither staining
intensity nor the frequency of T2R38 positive tumor cells
correlated with clinical or pathological parameters, or
with survival, presumably due to the fact that especially
pancreatic tumors are rather heterogeneous in their
composition.
T2R38 was mainly located in the cytoplasm in close
association with lipid droplets. Lipid droplets (also known
as lipid bodies or liposomes) were originally described as
storage compartments for lipids. More recently, they are
recognized as functional cell organelles, equipped with
specific proteins, and participating in lipid turnover, and
in the generation of inflammatory lipid mediators, such
as leukotrienes (reviewed in [13, 26-29]). Additional
functional activities are to be expected, because lipid
droplets also contain molecules that are not per se involved
in lipid metabolism, for example cytokines or metabolites
involved in intracellular trafficking [30]. Possibly, lipid
droplets are especially suitable for proteins that are
predestined for binding in a lipophilic environment ([30],
reviewed in [13, 26, 28]), such as T2R38.
T2R38 on pancreatic cells is functional. The bitter
tasting chemical PTU that is widely used as specific ligand
for T2R38 and the bacterial quorum-sensing molecule
AHL-12, which is so far the only known natural ligand
for T2R38, activated the MAP kinases p38 and ERK1/2,
and up-regulated NFATc1. This signaling pathway
concurs with G-protein-dependent signaling, and with
the activation pathway that has been described for AHL12 [21, 22, 31]. Although G-protein-dependent signaling
implies a surface receptor, as do the pathways activated
by AHL-12 [21, 22, 31], we found T2R38 predominantly
intracellular. Possibly, T2R38 can shuttle between the
storage site and the cell membrane. In principle, T2R38
can be expressed on the cell surface, for example on
myeloid cells, and also our uptake studies with labeled
AHL-12 show its co-localization with T2R38 on the
surface. On the other hand, because AHL-12 is lipophilic,
it is possible that it diffuses into the cell, and binds
intracellular.
The biological role of T2R38 beyond tasting “bitter”
is still under investigation. A role in local host defense
has been proposed, based on data showing expression of
T2R38 on airway epithelial cells and on phagocytic cells,
and up-regulation of defense-relevant functions by AHL12 [7, 9, 32-35]. Moreover, receptor allotypes with low
binding AHL-12 capacity predispose to infection [8, 11],
in line with data shown for other taste receptors [36, 37].
The role of T2R38 in tumors is less apparent.
Clark et al. suggested that bitter-tasting substances may
have specific physiological effects on cells carrying
bitter receptors, possibly underlying the “off-target drug
effects” of bitter-tasting pharmaceuticals [38]. In line

Association of T2R38 with lipid droplets
Analyses of cell lines by laser scan microscopy
showed an association of T2R38 with the cell membrane,
and throughout the cytoplasm in a more or less speckled
pattern. As in the biopsies, T2R38 was found in lipid
droplets, which were visualized either by staining with
Nile red or by an antibody to perilipin-2, the latter a
marker for lipid droplets [20] (Figure 3A, 3B, 3C). The
association of T2R38 with lipid droplets was confirmed
by isolating droplets from cell lines SU8686 and HuH7,
and examining them for expression of T2R38 by laser
scan microscopy and Western blotting (data for HuH7 are
shown in Figure 3D, 3E).

Activation of T2R38 by AHL-12 or PTU
Previous data by us and others identified the quorum
sensing molecule of P. aeruginosa AHL-12 as a natural
ligand for T2R38 [7, 8]. AHL-12 is known to bind to
numerous target cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages
[21, 22], and within 30 min to pancreatic tumor cells
or pancreatic stellate cells, as seen by cytofluorometry
(Figure 4A) or laser scan microscopy (Figure 4B). In
consequence, the MAP kinases p38 and ERK1/2 are
phosphorylated, and NFATc1 was upregulated (Figure
4C, 4D). In parallel to AHL-12, phenylthiourea (PTU) was
used, as is a widely used specific though artificial ligand
for T2R38. Again, p38 and ERK1/2 were phosphorylated,
and NFATc1 expression was enhanced. Moreover,
triggering T2R38 induced up-regulation of the multidrugresistance protein ABCB1. (Figure 4E).

DISCUSSION
Bitter receptors were initially detected in cells of
taste buds of the oral cavity, as chemosensors for bitter
tasting substances. In recent years, a broader distribution
of some bitter receptors was reported, for example in
neutrophils, breast cancer cell lines, enteroendocrine cells
of the colon, or airway epithelial cells [7, 8, 16, 18, 2325]. We now detected T2R38 in biopsies derived from

with this hypothesis, influence on tumor cell biology by
triggering T2R38 is feasible, for example the response
of tumor cells to chemotherapeutics might be decreased,
because the multi-drug resistance protein 1 (ABCB1)
was up-regulated in response to the established ligands
of T2R38, PTU or AHL-12. ABCB1 is a transmembrane
transporter that functions as an efflux pump for potentially
toxic substances, including chemotherapeutics (reviewed
in [39, 40])
Whether bitter receptor ligands come into contact
with tumor cells in pancreatic cancer in sufficient
concentrations is debatable. AHL-12 and other molecules
derived from the gut microbiome might be distributed via
the portal venous blood supply. Moreover, in advanced
tumor stages, extensive tissue damage and loss of
epithelial barriers occurs, and bacterial infections are
a common when a pancreatic cancer infiltrates the gut.
On the other hand, AHL-12 may not be the only ligand
for T2R38, because promiscuity - even for structurally
unrelated substances - has been described for a number of
bitter receptors [15], and therefore it is feasible that T2R38
responds to bitter tasting substances, for example, of food.
Data showing that polymorphisms of T2R38 (responder
versus non-responder allotypes with regard to the artificial
ligand PTU) are linked to the occurrence of colon cancer
[41] support a role of food ingredients.
A link between bitter tasting substances and tumor
biology has been suggested before. For example, increased
coffee consumption reduced the risk of liver cancer [42],
and lupulones from hops or epigallocathechin gallate from
green tea induce apoptosis of tumor cell lines [43, 44].
In line with tumor control via bitter receptors are data
showing that normal breast epithelial cells express T2R38,
whereas tumor cell lines downregulate the receptor [45].
In summary, our data demonstrate expression of
the bitter receptor T2R38 in human pancreatic cancer.
The biological relevance of the extragustatory expression
of T2R38 is still under investigation; effects of gut
microbiome derived mediators are feasible, considering
that T2R38 responds to a bacteria-derived molecule.
Engagement of T2R38 may take part in in pancreatic
cancer progression via the induction of chemoresistance
mechanisms.

Cytofluorometry
To determine the expression of surface receptors,
cells (106/ml) were incubated with anti-T2R38 (sc-34294,
Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany (2-6 µg), and PElabelled anti-goat-IgG (PA129953, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) as secondary antibody. The
specificity of the antibody was verified using the peptide
sc-34294p (2 µg). Cells were subjected to cytofluorometry
using FACSCalibur and CellQuest Pro software (Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For intracellular
staining, the cells were treated with FACS Permeabilizing
Solution 2 (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA), preincubated with the Fc-receptor blocking agent and then
incubated with anti-T2R38 as described above.

Western blotting
Tumor cells (5x105) were lysed with RIPA buffer
(Tris-buffered saline containing 1 % Nonidet P-40, 0.5
% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate,
0.0004 % sodium azide, 0.2 M orthovanadate and 0.5
M phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride). Of each sample 25
µl were mixed with 5 µl 5x Laemmli-buffer and applied
to a SDS-Gel (9 %). Following blotting, the membrane
was incubated in 5 % milk powder in TBS, containing
0.1 % Tween20. Of the antibody to T2R38 (sc-34294,

was a Pox conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG in a dilution of
1:15000 (Jackson Immuno Research, Pennsylvania, USA),
respectively peroxidase-labelled anti-mouse IgG (Jackson
Immuno Research).

Tissue of 88 resected pancreatic cancers (48 male
patients, 40 female patients) was obtained after surgery
and establishing the diagnosis of a pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. The mean age on day of surgery was
62.2 years (median: 65 years). All patients revealed a pT3
stage, 78 were diagnosed with lymph node metastasis
(pN1), and 10 with distant organ metastasis (liver, interaorto-caval lymph nodes). The histological grade was
G1: 4 patients, G2: 58 patients, and G3: 24 patients.
Two patients received no histological grading, due to
pre-operative neo-adjuvant therapy. 71 patients were
diagnosed with an R1 stage (defined as tumor cells less
than 1 mm from the peripancreatic margin). Follow up
information was available of 72 patients (median survival
in the T2R38 expression group: 623 days; in the nonexpressing group 599 days). The study was approved by
the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of
Heidelberg. A written informed consent of all patients was
obtained.

Laser scan microscopy
Cells were placed on cover slips, and fixed with
2 % PFA for 15 min. Then anti-T2R38 (6 µg) and the
secondary antibody was added (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey
anti-goat IgG (life technologies, Carlsbad, USA) were
added, and for comparison goat IgG. In parallel, the
antibody was added to the cells together with the peptide
sc-34294P. The samples were mounted with Moviol
(Sigma-Aldrich) and viewed by laser scan microscopy
(Nikon) using a 40x objective.
For visualization of droplets, Nile red (SigmaAldrich) was added (10 µg /ml 20 min, room temperature).
Alternatively, an antibody to perilipin-2 (Biozol, Eching,
Germany).

Tissue staining
Tissue micorarrays with a core size of 1.5 mm in
diameter were performed of patients with pancreatic
ductal
adenocarcinoma.
Standard
hematoxylin/
eosin (H&E) staining was performed, followed by
immunohistochemistry, using an anti human T2R38 (Santa
Cruz, sc-34294, 1:100, and retrieval condition: pH 9.0).
As secondary antibody the Dako EnVision kit (Dako) was
used, followed by counter stain with hematoxylin.
Indirect immunofluorescence: Pancreatic cancer
tissue (n=20 patients) was used. After deparaffinization
and antigen retrieval (pH 9.0), the tissue sections were
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS, followed
by incubation with the primary antibodies: goat anti human
T2R38 (sc-34294, Santa Cruz, 1:100), and anti-perilipin-2
(Biozol, Eching, Germany). As secondary antibody the
Alexa488 donkey anti goat (LifeTechnologies, Eugene,
Oregon, USA 1:400) or Cy3 conjugated goat anti mouse
IgG (Jackson Immuno Research, 1:300) were used,
followed by nuclear staining with Hoechst dye.

Isolation of lipid droplets
Essentially, the method described by Wan et al.
[30] was used. In brief, cells were suspended in 3 ml
ice cold disruption buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 50 µg /ml
N- α -p-tosyl- L-lysin-chloromethyl-ketone (TLCK), 1
µg /ml leupeptin, 1 µg /ml pepstatin, 1µg /ml aprotinin)
and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (10 min, 800 psi, 4°C).
The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 1.08 M
sucrose in disruption buffer without TLCK, centrifuged
for 30 min, 1000 g at 4°C to eliminate nuclei and intact
cells and the applied to a sucrose density centrifugation.
After ultracentrifugation (3.5 h, 34000 rpm, 4°C) the lipid
droplets were in the fraction with 0.54 M sucrose. This
fraction was diluted to 0.35 M sucrose and 0.15 M NaCl,
overlaid again with 0.27 M, 0.135 M and 0 M sucrose for
a second ultracentrifugation step (34000 rpm, 4°C, and 3.5
h). The lipid droplets were now in the fraction with 0.35
M sucrose. Droplets could be recognised by fluorescence
microscopy after having incorporated Nile red (see above).
For Western blotting the proteins were precipitated with
methanol (sample : methanol 1 :4, 5 h,-20°C, followed
by centrifugation for 30 min, 4°C, 16000g). The pellet
was resuspended in Laemmli buffer (95°C for 10 min)
and applied to a 12 % SDS-Gel. Western blotting was
performed as described above.
