ABSTRACT
Despite improved survival in the Rituximab (R) era, a considerable number of
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) ultimately die from the disease.
Functional imaging using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET is suggested for assessment of
residual viable tumor very early during treatment but is compromised by non-specific
tracer retention in inflammatory lesions. The PET tracer [18F]fluorodeoxythymidine
(FLT) as surrogate marker of tumor proliferation may overcome this limitation. We
present results of a prospective clinical study testing FLT-PET as superior and early
predictor of response to chemotherapy and outcome in DLBCL. 54 patients underwent
FLT-PET prior to and one week after the start of R-CHOP chemotherapy. Repetitive
FLT-PET imaging was readily implemented into the diagnostic work-up. Our data
demonstrate that the reduction of FLT standard uptake valuemean (SUVmean) and SUVmax
one week after chemotherapy was significantly higher in patients achieving complete
response (CR, n=48; non-CR, n=6; p<0.006). Martingale-residual and Cox proportional
hazard analyses showed a significant monotonous decrease of mortality risk with
increasing change in SUV. Consistent with these results, early FLT-PET response
showed relevant discriminative ability in predicting CR. In conclusion, very early FLTPET in the course of R-CHOP chemotherapy is feasible and enables identification of
patients at risk for treatment failure.

overall response rates and progression free (PFS) as
well as overall survival (OS) in the R era, a considerable
fraction of patients does not achieve a durable remission
after first line treatment and will ultimately die from the
disease. Therefore, it remains crucial to identify these
patients prior to or early in the course of treatment [1-3].

and clinical course. The international prognostic index
(IPI) allows estimation of the individual prognosis based
on easily available parameters [4] and has remained useful
for risk estimation in the rituximab era [5]. Important
insights into the molecular biology of this entity have been
gained with the introduction of DNA microarrays, which
provide a genome-wide profile of mRNA expression
levels in cancer samples. Gene expression profiling (GEP)
studies support the view that DLBCL is a heterogeneous
diagnostic category, as 3 molecular subtypes, termed
germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL, activated
B-cell (ABC) DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell
lymphoma (PMBL), could be detected, which are often
indistinguishable using conventional diagnostic tools.
These diagnostic DLBCL categories have significantly
different survival rates after standard treatment [6-9].
A different attempt to identify patients with higher
risk of treatment failure is to perform functional PET
imaging. However, while interim FDG-PET has proven
useful to identify patients that have an excellent prognosis
after standard treatment, this modality has heretofore
failed to accurately identify patients who would benefit
from alternative treatment strategies or who should be
included into clinical trials due to dismal outcome with
R-CHOP-like therapy [10-13]. An earlier identification
of patients using an alternative radiotracer that allows
response assessment immediately after initiation of
chemotherapy may be beneficial. A promising candidate
is the thymidine analog 3`-deoxy-3`-[18F]fluorothymidine
(FLT), a PET tracer derived from the cytostatic drug
azidovudine (AZT), that allows in vivo imaging of
proliferating tissues and malignant tumors [14]. Recently,
published studies demonstrated a significant correlation
of tumor cell proliferation and FLT uptake in lymphoma
and solid tumors [15-21]. Recent studies have also shown
that FLT-PET allows non-invasive assessment of tumor
grading, very early response assessment, and possibly
survival [15, 19, 22-24] in experimental animal models
and patients.
Predictive markers are desirable for guiding
risk-adjusted treatment in lymphoma. The aim of this
prospective study was to assess the suitability of FLT and
in particular the decrement of FLT uptake one week after
start of immuno-chemotherapy to predict response and
clinical outcome in patients with DLBCL.

of therapy assessment was available in 52 patients and
indicated CR in 46 patients, PR in 2 patients, and PD
was found in 4 patients, respectively. Importantly, FDGpositivity was found in 5 of the 32 patients with end of
treatment FDG-PET, including 4 patients in the non-CR
group. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Recurrence
and death were reported in 6 (11%) and 7 (13%) patients
respectively. The estimated 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence
free survival probabilities (95% confidence interval)
were 0.94 (0.89 to >0.99), 0.90 (0.81 to 0.99) and 0.78
(0.59 to >0.99). The respective estimated overall survival
probabilities were 0.94 (0.89 to >0.99), 0.89 (0.80 to 0.99)
and 0.76 (0.59 to 0.97) (Fig. 1).

Mean uptake of FLT-1 in lymphoma manifestations
(mean FLT-1 SUV) was 7.3 (range 1.0 – 18.2).
Corresponding maximum FLT-1 uptake values ranged
from 1.2 – 20.4, resulting in a mean of FLT-1 SUVmax
of 9.3. Mean SUVmean decreased one week after start
of treatment (FLT-2) to 1.8 (range 0.3 – 7.4) (Table 2),
resulting in a mean decrease of 73.1% (range: 0.0% 95.8%) (Table 2). Corresponding SUVmax values of FLT2 PET were 2.4 (range: 0.4 – 9.6) calculating to a mean
decrease of 73.6% (range: 10.8% - 96.1%) for change of
SUVmax (Table 2,). Thus, FLT PET performed one week
after standard treatment results in a substantial decrease in
both mean and maximal tracer uptake.

Six of 54 patients either progressed or relapsed after
achieving a response to initial treatment and 7 patients
died during the observation period (Fig. 2). Of the 7 deaths
4 were lymphoma-related (7.4%). Martingale-residual
analysis was performed for all seven death events and
revealed a significant correlation between survival and
change of SUV (Fig. 3). The corresponding estimated
hazard ratios per one-point increment of FLT-SUVmean and
FLT-SUVmax were 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50 to 0.84, p=0.001)
and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002) respectively.

FLT-2 SUVmean/max predict achieving a CR
Next, the FLT-2 data was analyzed for the predictive
value of FLT-2 with regard to achieving a CR. Due to
the low number of patients with PR or PD, FLT uptake
parameters were compared for patients in CR (n=48)
and patients in non-CR (n=6). FLT-2 uptake values one
week after treatment initiation were significantly lower
in patients achieving a CR compared to non-CR patients
(mean SUVmean: P=0.006; mean SUVmax: P=0.005, Table
3), the patient group that contained 4 patients with a
positive FDG-PET at end of treatment. Thus, FLT uptake
one week after treatment is predictive for achieving a CR.
We also calculated whether the decrement in
either FLT SUV was predictive. The mean decrease of
SUVmean and SUVmax was higher in patients achieving
CR (mean SUVmean-decrease: 73.6%, median: 79.7% and
mean SUVmax-decrease: 74.4%, median: 80.1%, Table 3)
compared to non-CR patients (mean SUVmean-decrease:
65.7%, median 70.5% and mean SUVmax-decrease:
63.2%, median 65.5%, Table 3). ROC analyses resulted
in areas under the curves of 0.622 (95%CI: 0.44-0.80) for
SUVmean and 0.655 (95% CI: 0.48 – 0.83) for changes
of SUVmax to predict complete response (Fig. 2).
Corresponding optimal cut-offs calculated to a decrease
of 79.0% SUVmean to predict a CR (positive predictive
value: 92.6%) and, respectively, 82.0% SUVmax to
predict a CR (positive predictive value: 95.7%)

in malignant lymphoma, which can be assessed noninvasively by PET [25]. Several studies testing interim
FDG-PET after 2-4 cycles of therapy have heretofore
failed to identify patients who would benefit from
alternative treatment strategies or who should be included
into clinical trials due to dismal outcome with R-CHOPlike therapy [10-13]. Here we used very early interim
FLT-PET performed one week after treatment initiation to
test the hypothesis that, firstly, the drop in proliferation
measured by FLT uptake/ retention and, secondly, the
remaining FLT uptake (FLT-2 SUV) may allow predicting
not only treatment response but also survival.
In concordance with the recent report of Lee and
colleagues [24] our similarly designed study (FLT-PET
day 7 after cycle 1 vs. before cycle 2) that included a
comparable number of patient also points to early FLTPET assessment as a prognostic/ predictive factor with
regard to response and survival. Assuming that very
early FLT-PET assessment should reflect immediate
treatment efficacy we deliberately chose this very short
interval between treatment initiation and second FLT-PET
imaging. Concluding from the comparison of these two
studies however the very early assessment performed
at day 7 might be too early and therefore inferior. It is
possible that the use of immunotherapy may increase

lesion inflammation. Since the mode of supposed action
for rituximab involves, next to direct pro-apoptotic
or complement-mediated effects [26] also antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity via the Fc fragment
of the antibody [27], the interval selected in our study
could be too short to optimally assess treatment efficacy.
Similarly, FDG measurement requires a minimum interval
to immuno-chemotherapy due to a transient increase in
stromal reaction that may result in overestimation of the
fraction of viable cells [28]. The recommendations by
the European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer consider a time interval of one to two weeks
between completion of a chemotherapy cycle and FDG
PET optimal to avoid transient flare at the disease sites
[29]. Thus a certain delay may be more suitable for
FLT-PET, too. On the other hand our study clearly
demonstrates in a large cohort that the decrement in FLT
uptake briefly after one therapy cycle is quite substantial.

We define an optimal cut-off value for SUVmean (79%)
and SUVmax (82%) decrease predictive for achieving a
complete remission, an important prognostic factor in first
line treatment of DLBCL [30].
Besides the above discussed limitations of our
study regarding the very early time point of assessment,
the moderate power to predict survival is however clearly
limited by the bias towards a patient cohort not under
immediate treatment pressure. Although synthesis is
highly standardized, FLT remains an experimental PET
tracer and was therefore only available once a week at
our institution. This limitation did not allow us to include
more patients with adverse prognostic factors, and reduced
performance status due to lymphoma activity is a very
important adverse prognostic factor [4]. Including patients
selected for adverse prognostic factors determined for
example by IPI score (4, 5), molecular assessment (31-33)
or also by advanced not yet broadly available techniques
(34-37) should allow to define a high risk population
more exactly than one single approach alone. Such a high
risk patient selection would also come by assessing the
suitability of FLT for early prediction of treatment failure
in a refractory/relapsed patient cohort [38].
To our knowledge we present results of one of
only two prospective studies investigating the predictive
value of very early interim FLT-PET regarding response
to treatment and survival in aggressive B-NHL. Despite
the favourable prognosis and outcome of patients in our
series, a significant role of FLT-PET for early survival
prediction could be demonstrated. However, although

Histopathological classification

the study results suggest potential usefulness of FLT-PET
for response prediction (upper confidence limits of the
estimated discrimination indices >0.8), further studies
need to be conducted to establish optimal thresholds
and to define more precisely the associated predictive
performance. Several adjustments with regard to timing
and patient selection in upcoming trials investigating FLT
or other novel PET tracers will be required.

Histology of lymphomas was classified according
to the updated WHO classification system [39]. In all 54
patients histopathology revealed aggressive B-NHL (Table
1), including 52 patients with DLBCL and 2 patients with
follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3b.

PET Imaging

METHODS

3’-deoxy-3’-[18F]fluorothymidine was synthesized
as previously described [40]. Imaging was performed on
a whole-body high resolution PET scanner (ECAT HR+;
Siemens/CTI; Knoxville, TN). This device simultaneously
acquires 47 contiguous slices with a slice thickness of 3.4
mm. The in-plane image resolution of transaxial images
was approximately 8 mm full width at half maximum
(FWHM), with an axial resolution of approximately 5 mm
FWHM.
Static emission images were acquired 45 minutes
after injection of approximately 300 MBq FLT (range: 270
– 340 MBq). Emission data were corrected for random
coincidences, dead time and attenuation and reconstructed
by filtered backprojection (Hanning filter with cut-off
frequency 0.4 cycle per bin). The matrix size was 128 x
128 pixels with a pixel size of 4.0 x 4.0 mm. The image
pixel counts were calibrated to activity concentrations
(Becquerel/milliliter) and decay corrected using the time
of tracer injection as reference.

Patients
54 patients with biopsy proven aggressive B-cell
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) were included in
this prospective study and completed the full FLT-PET
imaging protocol (26 men, 28 women, mean age: 58 ± 15
years). All patients were scheduled to undergo systemic
chemotherapy with R-CHOP-like treatment. Detailed
patient characteristics and risk factors are shown in Table
1.
All 54 patients underwent a pre-therapeutic FLTPET scan (FLT-1) as well as second scan (FLT-2) one week
after start of treatment (Fig. 4). Exclusion criteria included
previous or concurrent malignancies, preceding chemo- or
radiotherapy, and patients younger than 18 years. Details
of the study were explained by a physician and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients. The
study protocol was approved by the responsible ethics
committee of the Technische Universität München.

PET Data Analysis

Study design

All PET scans were evaluated by two observers
(board-certified nuclear medicine specialists) blinded to
the clinical data and the results of other imaging studies.
Circular regions of interest (ROIs) with a diameter of 1.5
cm were placed in the area with the highest tumor activity,
as previously published [41]. Mean lesion diameter and
range of initial tumor size were 4.6 cm (median: 4.0,
range: 2.0-17.5). Mean standardized uptake values (SUV)
were calculated from each ROI using the formula: SUV
= measured activity concentration (Bq/g) x body weight
(g)/injected activity (Bq). For further analyses, mean
values from both observers were used. Side-by-side
analysis has been performed to ensure SUV-calculation in
identical ROIs at various time points. This algorithm has
been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for assessment of
treatment response [41, 42].
For definition of ROIs and data analysis, computer
programs were developed in the Interactive Data
Language (IDL; Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, Co)
using the Clinical Application Programming Package
(CAPP; Siemens/CTI, Inc.) [43].

Baseline FLT-PET examination (FLT-1) was
performed within 1 week before therapy, together with
standard staging modalities (clinical examination, CT). As
FDG-PET is not routinely reimbursed in Germany, it was
available only for initial staging in a subgroup of patients
(n=32). FLT-PET imaging was repeated in all 54 patients
around one week after the start of the first course of
R-CHOP treatment (FLT-2) (range, day 5 to day 8, mean
6.3 days). An end of therapy FDG-PET as recommended
by the revised response criteria published in 2007 was
performed in 32 of the patients.
Patients received R-CHOP therapy in standard dose
(rituximab 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 day
1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 day
1 and prednisone 100 mg day 1-5) every 2 or 3 weeks
with dose modification or delays according to common
standards. 3 patients received additional etoposide 100mg/
m2 day 1-3 (R-CHOEP) and in one patient liposomal
doxorubicin was used with 30 mg/m² per day.

CT was performed as part of the routine clinical
management in all patients. Baseline CT of neck, thorax,
abdomen, and pelvis were performed in all patients
before chemotherapy. Patients were reevaluated by
means of CT after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy. The
treatment response was classified after completion of 6
cycles of R-CHOP/CHOP as complete response (CR),
partial response (PR), no change (NC), or progressive
disease (PD) according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria based
on the bi-dimensional diameters of corresponding tumor
lesions measured by ruler or caliper [44]. Further follow
up evaluations were carried out according to standard
protocols every 3 months. The median follow-up estimated
by the inverse Kaplan-Meier method [45] was 32.2 months
(range: 11.5 – 73.2 months; median: 28.6 months). The
patient management was not influenced by the results of
FLT-PET studies.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using PASW
Statistics software (version 20.0; SPSS, Inc. Chicago,
IL) and the statistical software R [46]. Quantitative
values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or
median and range as appropriate. Comparisons of related
metric measurements were performed using Wilcoxonsigned rank test and the Mann-Whitney-U test was used
to compare quantitative data between two independent
samples. To assess prognostic impact of continuous
variables with regard to survival, Martingale-residual
analysis was performed [47]. Smoothing spline equations
have been fitted to the residual plots to depict shape of
functional relationship between the continuous prognostic
variable and the risk of death.
Fisher’s exact test was used for comparison of
frequencies and Spearman correlation coefficients
were calculated to quantify bivariate correlations of
measurement data. Exact two-sided 95 percent confidence
intervals (CI) were reported for estimates of sensitivity
and specificity. In order to assess the discriminative ability
of FLT-SUV decreases for the dichotomous outcome
tumor response (complete remission (CR) versus partial
response (PR) or progressive disease (PD)), receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curves were fitted and the
area under the curve (AUC) along with 95% confidence
intervals reported. All statistical tests were conducted
two-sided and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance. No correction of p-values
was considered in the course of multiple testing; however,
results of all performed tests were thoroughly reported,
allowing for an informal adjustment for multiplicity while
reviewing the data [48].
