ment of the UGT1A1 promoter region. Individuals who are homozygous for the

the gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)
and irinotecan inactivation, in that degradation of SN-38, the active metabolite of
irinotecan, correlates inversely with the number of TA repeats in the TATA eleUGT1A1*28 allele (7 repeats) may exhibit reduced degradation of SN-38 and
increased probability of severe toxicities. Clinical study results, as reported in the
literature, have not been uniform, however, in showing a relation between genotype and the development of toxicities. Even when correlations are statistically
significant, confidence intervals are wide, rendering assessment of individual risk
difficult at best. Irinotecan labeling recommends testing for the UGT1A1*28 allele
and reducing irinotecan dosing in patients who are positive to reduce the likelihood of dose-limiting neutropenia only, but not diarrhea. Importantly, both
dose-limiting neutropenia and diarrhea are dependent on numerous known and
unknown factors, such as the specific regimen used, duration of therapy, doses,
cycle of treatment, and complexities of irinotecan pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, including other key enzymes and drug transporters. Guidance on
how to modify irinotecan dosing or how to incorporate the impact of multiple
variables into clinical decision-making does not exist. Furthermore, pharmacogenomic test results at this time can only provide an estimate of risk for subsets of
populations rather than a risk-benefit estimate for an individual. Consequently,
these test results are supplementary to clinical judgment, which requires assessing multiple variables that contribute to phenotype to arrive at individual dosing
decisions. Cancer 2008;113:1502-10.  2008 American Cancer Society.

ne of the challenges facing clinical medicine in this first part of
the 21st century is how to individualize pharmaceutical therapy
for patients. The goal of ‘‘personalized medicine’’ extends across
medical specialties, including pediatric and adult patient care. In no
other area of medicine is the goal of individualizing therapy more
important and more critical than in medical oncology.
Traditional cancer chemotherapies are toxic agents with very
narrow therapeutic windows between efficacy and toxicity.
Responses to—and toxicities from—chemotherapy vary substantially
from person to person. There are many sources for this interindividual variation, both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. The
variation in drug pharmacokinetics can be substantial, with inter-

individual differences in plasma concentrations of
some drugs varying by as much as 600-fold, because
of numerous factors including patient body size and
composition, age, ethnicity, and sex, as well as physiologic aspects including disease state and organ
function.1 Other factors that may impede or induce
drug metabolism and affect efficacy include concomitant medications (including herbal treatments) as
well as food, drink, and environmental toxins to
which patients may be exposed.2
Genetic factors are known to account for 15% to
30% of the differences in drug metabolism and
response.1 These genetic variations occur in the
expression of proteins responsible for the absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs.
Adding further to the complexity, genetic differences
may also be present in the proteins that are the targets of the medications.
A growing body of pharmacogenetic research has
highlighted the role of genetic disparities in drug metabolism and transport in explaining the ranges in
clinical profile of many key anticancer agents.3 In
cancer patients treated with chemotherapy, severe
toxicity occurs when patients do not have the capacity to metabolize active compounds normally,
whereas the therapeutic effect of a drug is diminished when there is a reduced ability to activate a
prodrug. Although there has been extensive research
into pharmacogenetic variability in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, with the goal of reducing the interindividual variations in anticancer
agent efficacy and toxicity, we have achieved only
limited success. A notable example is irinotecan. The
discovery of a relationship between a mutation in
the gene encoding a key protein involved in the inactivation of irinotecan—uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1)—and irinotecan
toxicity led the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to recommend genotyping of patients for this
variation before initiation of therapy. This finding, together with the FDA recommendation, has led some
to suggest that the day of ‘‘practical pharmacogenomics’’ in cancer therapy has arrived.4 In this article, we examine this correlation and specifically
address the question of the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic testing in the setting of irinotecan metabolism, toxicity, and dosing.

PHARMACOGENETICS OF IRINOTECAN
Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar, Pfizer Inc, New York,
NY) is a camptothecin analogue that functions as a
topoisomerase-I inhibitor. Irinotecan is used to treat
numerous malignancies, including colorectal cancer

and lung cancer, and is being investigated to treat
other diseases, both alone and in combination with
other agents. Irinotecan has been associated with
unpredictable toxicities, including myelosuppression
and diarrhea, which have sometimes been severe
and even fatal.
Irinotecan is activated to SN-38, its active metabolite, by carboxylesterase metabolism. SN-38 is inactivated predominantly by glucuronidation, a process
mediated primarily by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).5 This family of enzymes is
involved in phase II conjugative metabolism and
causes the substrates to be more polar, more soluble,
and more easily eliminated in bile and urine. The
enzyme UGT1A1 is felt to be the main member of the
UGT family involved in SN-38 glucuronidation. Several polymorphisms of the UGT1A1 enzyme have
been described (Table 1).6-9 These genetic variations
are based on the number of TA dinucleotide repeats
in the TATA element of the UGT1A1 promoter region,
with the number of repeats ranging from 5 to 8.2,6 Six
repeats (TA6) is considered the most widespread genotype and has been called the wild type; the most
common variant has 7 repeats and is termed
UGT1A1*28, or 7/7. This dinucleotide repeat insertion
has been associated with reduced gene expression as
well as diminished enzyme activity, which in turn has
been found to affect the metabolism of bilirubin as
well as SN-38 glucuronidation.10,11 Degradation of
SN-38 correlates inversely with the number of repeats,
and expression of UGT1A1 is significantly reduced in
individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28
allele.12
Several groups have found that a polymorphism
within the UGT1A1 gene correlated with those
patients who had severe toxicity from irinotecan.13
Irinotecan toxicity tends to increase as degradation
of SN-38 declines, because increased bioavailability
of SN-38 results in greater tissue exposure to this
active metabolite.12,14 As a result, diarrhea and neutropenia occur and are dose limiting.15

The finding of the correlation between a genetic
variation of UGT1A1*28 and irinotecan toxicity, especially neutropenia, led the FDA to change the labeling of irinotecan to recommend genotyping analysis
of patients before their beginning therapy, with the
recommendation that doses should be reduced in
patients who are found to have this genotype variation. There are no recommendations on how much
the dose should be reduced. Despite this recommendation, few oncologists actually follow this practice.
The question is, should we?

UGT1A1 and Clinical Findings in Colorectal Cancer
Several studies have evaluated the correlation
between UGT1A1 genotype and irinotecan toxicity
(Table 2).6,14,16-23 In general, these studies demonstrate an increased probability of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patients who are homozygous for
UGT1A1*28; some, but not all, also indicate an
increased risk of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea. The results of
these clinical studies of UGT1A1 genotype and toxicity are intriguing. Although they clearly demonstrate

a relationship between genotype and toxicity, questions remain regarding the strength of this correlation and whether it is sufficient as a sole or even a
principal factor in clinical decision making. For
example, study results reveal considerable heterogeneity and do not consistently demonstrate a strong
correlation between UGT1A1 genotype and toxicity
phenotype. Even when the increased risk is statistically significant, confidence intervals (CIs) are wide.
In 1 study of patients with a variety of tumors in
which homozygosity increased the risk of neutropenia 7.2-fold,14 the 95% CI of 2.5 to 22.3 suggested
that this increased risk operates within such a wide
range that individual risk is difficult to evaluate.
UGT1A1 testing does not necessarily predict the
occurrence of severe diarrhea, and the revised irinotecan prescribing information, which includes information about UGT1A1*28 and toxicity, refers only to
the risk of neutropenia.24 The dissociation between
neutropenia and diarrhea has been observed in various studies.16,25 One hypothesis for the mechanism
of this dissociation concerns the role of another

Irinotecan and UGT1A1 Pharmacogenetics/Deeken et al

UGT1A isoform (UGT1A7). Some UGT1A7 variants
result in decreased plasma levels of SN-38 yet are
associated with increased gastrointestinal toxicity,
perhaps because of increased gastrointestinal exposure to SN-38.16,20,25 Furthermore, occurrence of toxicity may be related to the specific regimen used,
including the combinations and numbers of agents,
duration of therapy, dosages, and cycle of treatment.
For example, diarrhea and vomiting are more common with single-agent than combination regimens
(although doses used are very different).26
Numerous studies have reported an association
between the UGT1A1*28 genotype and risk of toxicity. For our analysis, we used the 3 studies for which
specific rates of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea are available by
genotype (Table 3).17,19,27 By combining these data,
as well as combining data on patients who have at
least 1 variant allele (6 of 7 or 7 of 7 genotype), the
utility of genotyping for predicting severe toxicity
from diarrhea can be determined. By using the combined cohort of patients in these 3 studies, the sensitivity of the genotyping test is 0.70, the specificity is
0.51, the positive predictive value is 0.24, and the
negative predictive value is 0.88. For a screening test,
the low sensitivity and specificity highlight the low
utility of genotyping to predict grade 3 or 4 diarrhea.
Although the toxicity criteria used in these 3 studies
differed—the studies by Innocenti et al17 and Paoluzzi et al27 used the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, whereas Marcuello et al19 used
the World Health Organization Toxicity Grading
Scale—we believe that combining grades 3 and 4
toxicities in our analysis corrects for differences
between these 2 systems.
A recent large, prospective study examined the
UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and toxicities in patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer who received firstline treatment with the irinotecan/fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen.22 In this study, homozygosity for
the UGT1A1*28 genotype did not predict diarrhea
during any treatment cycle, and the relationship
between this genotype and neutropenia was significant only during the first treatment cycle (odds ratio,
8.63; 95% CI, 1.31-56.55).
Parodi et al. developed a multivariate predictive
model for the association of neutropenia with irinotecan treatment and examined the feasibility of using
bilirubin level as a substitute for UGT1A1 genotype
as a predictor of toxicity.23 This had previously been
suggested by Innocenti et al.17 Blood samples were
collected from 109 patients with untreated metastatic
colorectal cancer who received either irinotecan (180
mg/m2), leucovorin (LV), and bolus 5-fluorouracil
(FU) infusion (arm A); irinotecan (125 mg/m2), LV,

and bolus FU (arm B); or capecitabine and irinotecan (250 mg/m2) (arm C). Neutropenia occurred in
all treatment groups. In cycle 1, 3 cases of grade 3 or
4 neutropenia occurred in arm A, 10 cases in arm B,
and 4 in arm C. Overall, there were 16 cases in arm
A, 17 in arm B, and 9 in arm C (personal communication, March 14, 2008). Incorporating UGT1A1 genotype and/or bilirubin into the model and adjusting
for age and sex all failed to explain the occurrences
of irinotecan toxicity (r2, 0.04-0.37) (Table 4). The
model assumed an additive trend for being other
than the 6/6 genotype; therefore, 6 of 6 genotype
was scored as 0, 6/7 as 1, and 7 of 7 as 2. Arm A had
2 instances of 7/7 genotype, arm B 4, and arm C 5
(personal communication, March 14, 2008). The failure of this study to explain irinotecan toxicity would
seem to indicate that although UGT1A1 genotype
may contribute more than baseline bilirubin level to
predicting the degree of treatment-related neutropenia, the predictive value of UGT1A1 is limited by a
variety of both identifiable and as-yet-unaccountedfor factors.23
Ramchandani et al. also explored the use of
UGT1A1 genotype, SN-38 exposure, and baseline bilirubin to explain neutropenia by measuring the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir after irinotecan
exposure.28 They studied 86 patients, 66 from the
study reported by Innocenti et al17 and 20 patients
from a study reported by Iyer et al.11 Patients in
these 2 studies were treated with high doses of irinotecan (300 mg/m2 or 350 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. In
the combined analysis, total SN-38 exposure as
measured by area under the curve, as well as the

related with ANC nadir (R2 5 0.49). The authors
tested an alternative model, using baseline total bilirubin and the UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype, and again
found a correlation with ANC nadir. However, this
second model, which included both bilirubin and genotype, explained less of the observed variation in
neutropenia (R2 5 0.31).
Recently Hoskins et al. reported their results
from a meta-analysis of 10 irinotecan pharmacogenetic studies that included 825 patients.29 These
authors found that the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity in UGT1A1*28 patients was positively correlated with the dose of irinotecan used as
well as with the overall incidence of toxicity in all
patients treated with that specific regimen. Their
conclusion was that the use of genotyping may be
helpful only for patients receiving high doses of irinotecan, and that patients receiving lower doses do
not need to be genotyped.
As the summary in Table 2 highlights, some
patients who test negative for UGT1A1*28 homozygosity may still experience toxicity, and others who
test positive for the same homozygosity may not.
Given the relatively low frequency of homozygosity
in various populations and the relatively low correlations of UGT1A1 genotype with factors such as
age, sex, and baseline bilirubin level, the value of
testing for a single genotypic variation to help determine treatment becomes less certain. Indeed, the
focus on an individual variation within a single gene
may prove less useful than alternatives such as haplotype and linkage disequilibrium analyses that
evaluate the association between genotype mutation
and phenotype.12,30 Other genetic variations within
the UGT1A1 gene need further exploration, including 23156G>A and 23279G>T.17,31 Because these
promoter region variations have been found to be

in linkage disequilibrium, with different haplotypes
identified based on these variations,32 future
research could help discern whether a haplotype
that includes other variations with the UGT1A1*28
7/7 genotype more accurately predicts which
patients are likely to experience severe irinotecan
toxicity.
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
of irinotecan are complex, and metabolic pathways
contain many points at which activation, transport,
and degradation may be altered (Fig. 1).13,16,33-36
Although UGT1A1 clearly plays an important role in
the metabolism of SN-38, other UGT1A isoforms,
such as UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10,
are also involved, variants of which may well be important in phenotypic expressions of toxicity.16,20,34,36,37 Drug transporters and their genetic
variants, including ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and
ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein), may also
affect the metabolism and elimination of irinotecan.38-41 In addition, other genes, their enzyme products, and their interactions may play important
though as-yet-unknown roles.16,42
A common assumption in medical oncology is
that more is better, ie, higher levels of chemotherapy
dosing can produce better responses. Yet these
improvements are countered by limitations because
of toxicity. Interestingly, while genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A1 may or may not correlate with toxicity, genetic variations have not been found to
correlate with efficacy. No past studies have found
that UGT1A1 polymorphisms correlate with
improved response.

Practical Considerations
Genotype is only 1 of many factors that influence
phenotype. Certainly the total effect is the sum of

many genetic factors—some tested, some untested—
plus environmental factors such as diet, nutrition,
weight, organ function, concomitant medications,
and complementary therapies, such as herbal treatments.3 Other patient characteristics, such as liver
and kidney function, age, comorbidities, and performance status, all contribute to the way a patient
will respond to a drug, especially in terms of toxicity
reactions.16,26 Presently we have no prospective data
incorporating the consideration of multiple variables
such as these to provide clinical guidance.
Guidelines and recommendations based on genotype test results are minimal. The prescribing information for irinotecan states that dose adjustments
should be made for patients who are homozygous
for the UGT1A1*28 allele and adds that because of
our incomplete knowledge thus far, modifications
should be based on individual responses to treatment.24
Although we know that UGT1A1*28 increases the
risk of neutropenia in some patients, we also know
that this risk is influenced by numerous other variables. On the basis of current data, therefore, at what
level of risk of diminished treatment efficacy do we
administer lower doses or substitute an alternative
regimen? How do we identify patients at risk for
severe diarrhea? How do we treat patients who are
heterozygous for the allele TA7/TA6? How do we
manage patients with polymorphisms for enzymes
involved in the metabolism of other drugs that may
be included in combination therapy?

Current Practice
In medical oncology, we initiate therapy at a maximum tolerated dose. As standard practice, most
drugs are dosed according to body surface area, a
measure that correlates closely with renal clearance.43 If significant toxicities are seen, dosages are
reduced in subsequent cycles. Although we normally reduce dosages for toxicity, we rarely, if ever,
increase dosages if patients do not experience significant toxicity. Whether these patients are receiving efficacious doses remains unknown, and if their
disease recurs or they have a poor response, the
question remains whether they received appropriate
doses.
Given the lack of high sensitivity and specificity
to predict severe toxicity from irinotecan based on
the UGT1A1*28 genotype, we do not prospectively
genotype patients in our practice. Furthermore, if
dosages were to be reduced based on genotype information alone, there is no clear guidance about
whether dosages should be increased in subsequent
cycles if they did not experience toxicity after the

first cycle, or whether clinical benefit would be preserved. Because the UGT1A1*28 genotype has not
been found to correlate with response at standard
doses, reducing doses in these patients becomes
even more suspect. Clinical practice does not change
based on genotype information.
Confusion over the UGT1A1/irinotecan association has affected clinical research within our developmental therapeutics and gastrointestinal oncology
clinics. Most studies that include irinotecan in phase
1 and phase 2 trials now require patients to be genotyped, and often, patients who are positive for
UGT1A1*28 homozygosity are excluded from these
trials without a firm foundation justifying the exclusion.

Summary and Conclusion
Pharmacogenomic research is beginning to provide
valuable information on genetic variations, their
impact on drug metabolism, and other elements
that contribute to patient response to treatment.
Translating this information to clinical practice is
still in the early stages, however. Genetic screening,
as currently available, does not provide a complete
estimate of risk in patients to be treated with irinotecan, and evidence-based guidelines are lacking
on the best actions to take even if test results
are known. Although pharmacogenomic testing provides supplementary information, clinical judgment
remains paramount. Other factors to consider include previous treatment history and patient/
disease variables that contribute to phenotype. Presently, pharmacogenomic test results provide a
rough estimate of toxicity for subsets of patients
(for example, those who are homozygous for the
UGT1A1*28 variant), but they do not provide a riskbenefit estimate that allows therapy to be tailored
for a specific patient.
What remains to be determined is the relative
importance of variations in UGT1A1 genotype, in
other key enzymes, and in drug transporters
involved in irinotecan disposition. A better understanding of these pathways, and of the variations
that can occur at each step along the way, is critical
if we are to achieve the promise of individualized
medicine using irinotecan. In addition, genetic and
tumor-specific variations in the proteins that serve
as anticancer drug targets need to be evaluated, and
predictive models need to be developed that can aid
clinicians in choosing drugs and regimens for individual patients. If we can accomplish all these goals,
then—and likely only then—will the day of ‘‘practical pharmacogenetics’’ truly be here.
