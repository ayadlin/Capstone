ABSTRACT
Background: First-line treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
inhibitors in NSCLC is effective in patients with activating EGFR mutations. The activity
of erlotinib in patients harboring high EGFR gene copy number has been considered
debatable.
Patients and Methods: A multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II clinical trial
was performed to test the efficacy of erlotinib in the first-line treatment of NSCLC
patients harboring high EGFR gene copy number defined as ≥4 copies in ≥40% of
cells.
Findings: Between December 2007 and April 2011, tumor samples from
149 subjects were screened for EGFR gene copy number by fluorescence in-situ
hybridization (FISH), Out of 49 patients with positive EGFR FISH test, 45 were treated
with erlotinib. Median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 3.3 months (95%CI:
1.8–3.9 months), and median overall survival was 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.1–12.6
months). Toxicity profile of erlotinib was consistent with its known safety profile.
The trial was stopped prematurely at 63% of originally planned sample size due to
accumulating evidence that EGFR gene copy number should not be used to select
NSCLC patients to first-line therapy with EGFR TKI. Data on erlotinib efficacy according
to EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutations are additionally presented.
Interpretation: This trial argues against using high gene copy number for
selection of NSCLC patients to first-line therapy with EGFR TKIs. The study adds
to the discussion on efficacy of other targeted agents in patients with target gene
amplified tumors.

INTRODUCTION

High EGFR gene copy number was defined
as ≥4 copies of the gene in ≥40% of tumor cells (high
polysomy), presence of tight gene clusters, a gene-tochromosome ratio per cell of ≥2, or ≥15 copies of EGFR
per cell in ≥10% of analyzed cells (gene amplification).
The protocols for EGFR gene copy number assessment,
together with the definitions of “positive EGFR FISH
test” were kindly shared for the purpose of this trial by dr
Marileila Varella-Garcia, the Head of Cytogenetics Core
Facility at the University of Colorado. All reagents and
commercially available FISH probes (Abbott Molecular,
Des Plaines, IL, USA) employed in FLIKER study, were
used in accordance with the protocol developed at the
University of Colorado. Before trial commencement,
blinded set of slides received from the University of
Colorado was scored at the Department of Biology
and Genetics, Medical University of Gdańsk, to secure
reproducible performance. Translational part of the
trial included evaluation of EGFR FISH positive tumor
samples for the presence of activating EGFR, KRAS
and BRAF mutations with validated Cobas PCR-based,
IVD certified tests (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, CA,
Pleasanton, USA).

First and second generation EGFR inhibitors,
erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib, have now established
role in the treatment of patients with lung carcinomas
harboring activating EGFR mutations. Compelling
evidence to use EGFR genotyping to select patients
to first-line EGFR inhibitor treatment come from the
IPASS study [1] and from subsequent clinical trials that
randomized patients with EGFR mutated tumors to EGFR
inhibitor versus chemotherapy [2] [3] [4] [5]. Two large,
placebo-controlled phase III trials compared erlotinib or
gefitinib vs. placebo in the second or third line setting in
unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Both studies indicated that the subset
of patients harboring high EGFR gene copy number may
derive significant benefit from EGFR inhibitor therapy
[6] [7]. The cut-off point of EGFR positivity (defining
“high gene copy number”) was previously determined
as ≥4 EGFR copies in ≥40% of tumor cells, or numerous
gene clusters observed in at least 10% of tumor cells
[8]. With these background data, investigators at Central
and East European Study Group (CEEOG) initiated the
first-line multicenter, open-label, single arm, phase II
trial (FLIKER), to evaluate the efficacy of EGFR TKI
erlotinib in NSCLC patients with tumors harboring high
EGFR gene copy number defined as above. This trial was
commenced before a general adoption of EGFR mutations
for selection of lung cancer patients to EGFR inhibitor
treatment. We present here the final results of this trial,
together with molecular analysis of EGFR, KRAS and
BRAF mutation status in the tumor.

Study subjects
Planed sample size of 72 subjects (53 events) was
calculated assuming proportions of patients alive and free
of progression at 12 months to be equal to 12.5% (P0, the
null hypothesis) and 25% (P1, the alternative hypothesis
implying the doubling of the proportion). With assumption
of 32% of EGFR FISH positivity rate, 238 patients had
to be screened with EGFR FISH. The trial was stopped
prematurely on ethical grounds after 45 patients had been
registered (149 screened for high EGFR copy number by
FISH; 63% of planned sample size) due to convincing
evidence to use EGFR mutations rather then copy number
to select patients for first-line erlotinib treatment [1].
Patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB
(with pleural effusion) or stage IV NSCLC according to
6th edition of TNM classification (all classified as stage
IV according to current 7th edition of TNM classification),
with no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, were
prospectively enrolled on the study from seven CEEOG
institutions in Poland. Paraffin-embedded tumor sample
obtained from primary tumor or metastatic site at NSCLC
diagnosis was required for analysis of EGFR gene copy
number by FISH (cytology without specimen processing
through cell block rendered the patient ineligible for the
trial). Patients were required to have had clinically and/
or radiographically documented measurable disease
according to RECIST 1.0 criteria, to be >18 years old,
to have WHO performance status of 0-2 and adequate
hematological, hepatic and renal functions. No previous
malignancies were allowed, except for adequately treated
in situ carcinoma of the cervix or squamous carcinoma of

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design
The primary endpoint of this trial (CEEOG 0106,
ML20033) was the proportion of patients alive and free
of progression at 12 months after study entry. Secondary
endpoints included response rate, overall survival, toxicity
and feasibility of patient selection based on EGFR gene
copy number.
Patients from seven Polish institutions collaborating
within CEEOG were registered for molecular screening
(EGFR gene copy number by FISH). Upon positive
test performed centrally at the Medical University of
Gdańsk, patients were included in the study and treated
with erlotinib until disease progression, unacceptable
toxicity or withdrawn consent. Patients with negative
test were offered the best available treatment (most
often chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy) or best
supportive care according to the decision of their primary
physician.

the skin. Previous radiotherapy was acceptable, provided
marker lesions were outside the irradiated volume.
The trial was approved by Local Ethics Committees
of all participating institutions and the written informed
consent had to be obtained before patient registration in
the study.

Continuous variables were summarized by
providing the number of observed values, mean, standard
error, quartiles, and minimum and maximum values.
Categorical variables were summarized by providing the
counts and frequencies for the distinct categories. Survival
curves were estimated with the use of Kaplan-Meier
estimator. Confidence intervals for survival probabilities
were constructed based on the log-log transformation of
the survival function. Formal comparisons of survival
curves were conducted using the log-rank test. The median
follow-up time was estimated using the “reverse” KaplanMeier estimator, i.e., considering censored observations
as failures and vice versa. Results of all statistical
significance tests were assessed using the 5% significance
level (two-sided). Computations were performed using
SAS v. 9.3 and STATA v. 13.

Drug administration
Continuous oral erlotinib (Tarceva, Roche,
Switzerland) was given on an outpatient basis at a fixed
dose of 150 mg taken at least one hour before or two
hours after the ingestion of food or any other medication.
In the event of toxicity (e.g. diarrhea, rash), regardless of
its severity, that was not controlled by optimal supportive
care or not tolerated due to any reason, the daily dose of
erlotinib was decreased to 100 mg/day. Patients who could
not tolerate the reduced erlotinib dose were permanently
discontinued from the study.
Evaluation of response was performed according
to the RECIST criteria. Target lesions were assessed by
clinical examination and computed tomography (CT).
The initial examinations had to be performed within 28
days prior to registration. Evaluation of target lesions
was planned every four weeks for the first six cycles and
then every eight weeks. Response had to be confirmed by
second evaluation performed at least four weeks apart.
Study visits for toxicity evaluation were scheduled every
four weeks. Toxicity was assessed by Common Toxicity
Criteria 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute. Quality of life
or lung cancer symptom assessment was not performed in
this trial.

RESULTS
Between December 2007 and April 2011, tumor
samples from 149 patients were subjected to the molecular
screening for the number of the EGFR gene copy number.
EGFR FISH test was positive in 49 samples (33%) with
the criteria described above, 53 samples (36%) were
negative, 23 samples (15%) had an insufficient material
and in 24 samples (16%) the hybridization was inadequate,
precluding informative assessment. Out of 49 patients
with positive EGFR FISH test on screening, 45 patients
(37 with high EGFR polysomy and eight with EGFR

amplification) were registered in the trial, and four did not
meet predefined eligibility criteria. Consort diagram of the
trial is provided in Figure 1.
The trial was stopped prematurely in April 2011 due
to compelling evidence from other studies that NSCLC
patients should be selected to first-line EGFR TKI therapy
based on the presence of activating EGFR mutations, and
that patients with tumors showing wild-type EGFR may be
have inferior outcome when treated with first-line EGFR
TKI as compared to chemotherapy.
Translational research part of the FLIKER trial
included evaluation of samples from trial participants
for the presence of EGFR mutations (N = 43, nine [21%]
activating mutations detected), K-RAS mutations (N =
40, 11 [28%] mutations detected) and BRAF mutations
(N = 30, no mutation detected). Decreasing number of
samples analyzed for particular mutations was primarily
due to insufficient or depleted material from tumors
that had been previously subjected to other tests. EGFR
mutations were found in 3 of 8 patients (38%) with true
EGFR amplification and in 6 of 35 patients (12%) with no
amplification (p = 0.33). K-RAS mutations were present
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in none of 7 (0%) and in 11 of 33 patients (33%) with or
without amplification, respectively (p = 0.16).
Notably, study group included only five patients
with squamous-cell carcinomas (11%), most patients had
adenocarcinomas (N = 35, 78%; Table 1). The majority of
patients (N = 35, 78%) had performance status of 0 or 1,
and 10 patients (22%) had performance status of 2.
At the database lock (December 31, 2012) there
were 43 PFS events among the 45 patients enrolled in
the study. Four patients died without progression, 36 died
with progression, three had progression and were alive,
and two were alive and progression-free. After the median
follow up time of 34.6 months, median PFS in the trial
intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 3.3 months (95%CI:
1.8–3.9 months) and PFS probability at 12 months was
6.9% (95% CI: 1.8–17%; Figure 2). With 40 deaths among
45 patients, median overall survival was 7.9 months (95%
CI: 5.1–12.6 months) and OS probability at 12 months
was 38% (95%CI: 24–52%; Figure 3).
PFS and OS results were broadly similar for 37
patients with tumors harboring high EGFR gene copy
number vs. eight patients with EGFR gene amplification

tumors have been demonstrated in other studies [6] [7].
The proportion of EGFR-mutated tumors in patients with
true amplification was numerically higher compared to
cases with high polysomy (38% and 12%, respectively),
but a low number of patients with both EGFR mutations
and EGFR amplification precluded a meaningful analysis.
In the current study, no testing for the EGFR activating
mutations was performed in patients with a FISH-negative
status.
Although closed prematurely, the study provides
convincing evidence against the use of increased EGFR
gene copy number as a predictive marker for selection
of NSCLC patients to first-line therapy with erlotinib.
Median PFS of only 3.3 months compares unfavorably
with 10-13 months observed with erlotinib in trials
selecting patients by EGFR activating mutations [3] [4].
Our results are in line with other published evidence. In
the IPASS study comparing gefitinib vs. carboplatin and
paclitaxel, patients with EGFR mutated tumors had an
apparent PFS advantage from gefitinib, and patients with
wild-type EGFR from chemotherapy [1]. However, in
patients with increased EGFR gene copy number without
EGFR mutations, PFS with gefitinib was significantly
shorter compared to chemotherapy (HR = 3.85) [10]. The
results of this analysis prompted us to close FLIKER trial
due to ethical concerns.
To the best of our knowledge this is the only
prospective study using EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy,
which enrolled exclusively patients with increased
EGFR gene copy number. EGFR FISH positivity was
also used to select patients to EGFR TKI inhibitor
(gefitinib) in the ONCOBELL trial, but this study also
included patients who never smoked or showed high
phospho-Akt immunohistochemical staining [11]. In
another trial comparing gefitinib and vinorelbine, the
post-hoc exploratory analysis showed the superiority of
chemotherapy in patients with high EGFR gene copy
number [12]. Poor outcomes in patients with increased
EGFR gene copy number (response rate of 13% and a
median PFS of 8.4 weeks) were also found for afatinib, a
second-generation EGFR TKI inhibitor [13].
The results of these studies, including ours, indicate
that increased gene copy number does not seem to define
oncogene-addicted tumors, as opposed to activating
oncogenic mutations (e.g. EGFR, HER2, BRAF, NTRK1)
or rearrangements (ALK, ROS1 and RET). Perhaps
selection of cut-off points at higher gene copy number
levels might better define oncogene addiction and
treatment benefit of targeting agents. In our study the
subset of patients with germline EGFR amplification was
too small to draw firm conclusion on this issue. However,
such relationship has been demonstrated for other
alterations. For example, out of three cohorts of NSCLC
patients with increasing MET/CEP7 ratios (1.8-2.2, 2.2–
5.0 and above 5.0), the last had the highest tumor response
rates to MET inhibitor crizotinib [14]. Therefore, clinical

(N = 8) (Figure 4 and 5, respectively). Patients with
tumors harboring EGFR mutations (N = 9) tended to have
longer PFS than patients with wild-type EGFR (N = 36;
median of 8.0 vs. 2.6 months, respectively, log-rank P =
0.089; Figure 6) and longer OS (median of 13.6 vs. 5.8
months, respectively, P = 0.109; Figure 7). Patients with
tumors harboring KRAS mutations (N = 11) compared to
those with wild-type KRAS (N = 29) tended to have shorter
PFS (median of 1.4 vs. 3.5 months, respectively, log-rank
P = 0.103; data not shown) with no significant difference
for OS (median of 5.8 vs. 9.6 months, log-rank P = 0.91;
data not shown).
Partial response was observed in five out of 45
patients (11%), stable disease in 13 patients (29%),
progressive disease in 22 patients (49%) and five patients
were not evaluable (11%). Response rates were similar
in patients with high EGFR gene copy number (4/37
patients) vs. in those harboring EGFR gene amplification
(1/8 patients). Responses appeared more common in
patients with EGFR mutations (4/9 patients) compared
to those with wild-type EGFR (0/34 patients). Responses
were more common in patients with wild-type KRAS (4/29
patients) compared to those with tumors harboring KRAS
mutations (0/11 patients).
Toxicity was evaluated using Common Toxicity
Criteria 3.0. Adverse events were consistent with known
erlotinib toxicity profile. Grade 3 toxicities were rare
and included diarrhea (3/45 patients; 6.7%), skin rash
(2/45 patients; 4.4%), dyspnea (1/45 patients; 2.2%),
hiperbilirubinemia (1/45 patients; 2.2%), chest and spinal
pain (2/45 patients; 4.4%) and hydropericardium (1/45
patients; 2.2%).
A total of 18 serious adverse events (SAEs),
including seven events related to disease progression, were
recorded in 17 trial participants. Six SAEs were related
to erlotinib (unknown, doubtful or certain relationship
to investigational product), including diarrhea (N =
1), diarrhea/vomiting (N = 1), exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (N = 2), dyspnea (N = 1)
and fever/seizures (N = 1). None of these conditions led
to protocol treatment interruption or withdrawal, and all
improved or resolved during subsequent erlotinib therapy.

DISCUSSION
We present here the results of prospectively
designed trial evaluating the efficacy of erlotinib in
advanced NSCLC patients selected by high EGFR gene
copy number. The rate of EGFR FISH positivity in this
trial (33%) compares well with reported series (31–
38%) [6] [7] [9], and is in accordance with the protocol
assumptions. The rate of EGFR activating mutations
in this FISH-positive population was 21%, somewhat
higher than in unselected NSCLC patients, but indicating
a relatively weak relationship between both alterations.

trials using gene copy number to select patients to targeted
therapies should carefully define optimal cut-off levels and
predictive values of “true amplifications”.
Our trial was based on results of biomarker data
from two randomized, placebo-controlled trials (BR21 and IRESSA) comparing respectively gefitinib and
erlotinib vs. placebo in chemotherapy-pretreated NSCLC
patients [15] [16]. Both trials demonstrated increased
survival with TKI inhibitors in subjects with high EGFR
gene copy number defined by FISH. The discrepant
predictive value of EGFR copy number in chemotherapypretreated patients in these trials, and in chemotherapy
naïve patients in our study is intriguing and warrants
further investigation.
We are aware of limitations of this study, including
small number of patients and closure of recruitment before
the planned number of patients was reached. Nevertheless,
our data do not support the use of EGFR gene copy
number for prediction of benefit from first line erlotinib
treatment in advanced NSCLC. Potential predictive value
of gene amplification with high target gene levels merits
further investigations.
