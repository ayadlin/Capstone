therapeutic approaches that will permit progression in enhancing
the survival of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma rely on identifying
and understanding signal transduction pathways that result in, or
prevent, rhabdomyosarcoma apoptosis. Apoptosis describes a
series of evolutionarily conserved, tightly controlled mechanisms
as a means to induce self-destruction, which is required to
maintain normal tissue homeostasis. Cancer can therefore be
partially attributed to a failure of cells to induce their apoptotic
program (2).
Sphingolipids have a dual role within the cell, acting as key
structural components of membranes as well as serving as
bioactive second messengers. Central to the chemical backbone
of all sphingolipids, sphingosine represents an intermediate linking
the metabolism of ceramide to sphingosine-1-phosphate. Cellular
levels of sphingosine are controlled by the action of ceramide
synthase or sphingosine kinase, which are responsible for the
formation of ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, respectively.
Conversely, sphingosine may be formed by the action of ceramidase from ceramide or sphingosine-1-phosphatase from sphingosine-1-phosphate (3, 4). Whereas an accumulation of ceramide
and/or sphingosine functions as second messengers mediating
cellular stress (5–9), accumulation of intracellular sphingosine1-phosphate is related to survival. These opposing cellular
responses mediated by intimately related molecules have led to
the suggestion that a dynamic balance exists between ceramide,
sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, termed the ‘‘sphingolipid rheostat’’ (5–9).
Coupled with the effects of exogenous exposure of cells to
ceramide(s) or the manipulation of enzymes responsible for
ceramide accumulation, numerous studies have identified ceramide as a key inducer of cytotoxicity mediated by multiple agents
that induce cellular stress including cytokines, chemotherapeutic
agents, and ionizing radiation (4). More recent studies have
identified a role for elevated levels of cellular sphingosine to
mediate stress responses to the described classes of agents (5–7,
10), of relevance given their use in the first line treatment of
rhabdomyosarcoma. However, unlike ceramide, the signal transduction pathways mediated by an accumulation of cellular
sphingosine are ill defined.
Propagation and execution of apoptotic signals require the
activation of the caspase cascade, a family of cysteine proteases.
These have been subdivided into initiator (caspase-1, -2, -4, -5, -8,
-9, -10, -11, and -12) and executioner (caspase-3, -6, and -7)
caspases. In addition to their crucial role as the energy-producing
center of the cell, the mitochondria are central to the convergence
of the intrinsic or extrinsic cellular signal transduction pathways
that result in apoptosis. Essential to this process is the release of
cytochrome c and other mitochondrial-related proteins that are
normally confined to the mitochondrial intermembrane space by

Abstract
Sphingolipids is the collective term ascribed to components of
the sphingomyelin cycle. Modulation of the cellular levels of
individual sphingolipids can induce a diverse range of cellular
responses including apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle
arrest. We present data showing that rhabdomyosarcoma cell
lines, independent of lineage (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), are particularly sensitive
to the induction of apoptosis as a result of an elevation in the
cellular levels of sphingosine (D-erythro-sphingosine). Sphingosine-mediated apoptosis does not require its metabolism to
the related proapoptotic molecule ceramide and is stereospecific because exposure of the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD
to the L-erythro and DL-threo isoforms of sphingosine did not
induce apoptosis. Importantly, for efficient induction of
apoptosis, sphingosine required Bax activation and consequential translocation to the mitochondria. This resulted in
selective mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/
Diablo but not other mitochondrial related factors (apoptosisinducing factor, endonuclease G, and HtrA2/Omi). Using small
interfering RNA, reduced Bax expression conferred the
impaired release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytoplasm following sphingosine exposure, inhibiting the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, dissipation of the inner
mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced production
of reactive oxygen species were not observed. Bax activation
and cytochrome c release were independent of caspases;
however, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity distal to the
mitochondria was essential for the execution of apoptosis.

Introduction
Rhabdomyosarcoma describes malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that arise from cells committed to a skeletal muscle
lineage and is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children
under the age of 15 years. Rhabdomyosarcoma tumors are
characterized according to histology into two major categories,
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,
the latter being considerably more refractory to therapy (1). Novel

ratio as that containing sphingosine(s). Soluble tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand was prepared as previously
described (34).
Cell culture and treatment. The rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines Rh18,
Rh36, and Rh41 were established at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
(Memphis, TN). The rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, human embryonic
kidney cell line HEK293, human foreskin fibroblasts, and murine skeletal
myoblast cell line C2C12 were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. RD and Rh36 are of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma origin and
Rh18 and Rh41 of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma origin. Cell lines were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% characterized fetal bovine serum
(Life Technologies/Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and 10 mmol/L
L-glutamine. For apoptosis assays, cells were plated at a density of
250,000 per well in 12 well-plates; for protein extraction assays, 3  106 per
10-cm2 Petri dish; and for immunoprecipitation assays, 1  107 in T75
culture vessels were harvested. After overnight attachment, cells were
treated for up to 24 h with either vehicle alone, sphingosine, L-erythrosphingosine, threo-sphingosine, or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.
Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 60 min with fumonisin B1 (100–
200 Ag/mL), bongkrekic acid, cyclosporin A, z-FA-fmk, z-VAD(OMe)-fmk
(z-VAD-fmk), z-D(OMe)ED(OMe)-fmk (z-DED-fmk), and z-LE(OH)HD(OMe)fmk (z-LEHD-fmk; all 50 Amol/L) or for 4 h with catalase (1,000 mU/mL) or
N-acetylcysteine (5 mmol/L).
Retroviral expression vectors. The retroviral expression vectors
pMSCV-I-CrmA (expressing the viral caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA), pMSCV-IDN-caspase-8 (expressing dominant negative mutant caspase-8), and
pMSCV-DN-FADD [expressing the death domain only of Fas-associated
death domain (FADD)], all also expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
and separated by an internal ribosome entry site sequence, and the control
vector pMSCV-I-GFP (expressing GFP) were kind gifts from Drs. Jill M. Lahti
and Vincent J. Kidd (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital) and have
previously been described (34). Retroviral supernatants were prepared as
previously described from HEK293T cells (34). RD cells were incubated
overnight with viral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (8 Ag/mL;
Sigma). After 24 h, the supernatant was discarded and RD cells incubated
for a further 24 h with fresh viral supernatant. Viral transduced RD cells
were then incubated at 37jC in nonviral media for an additional 48 h. The
viral-transduced cells were sorted by expression of GFP using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (MoFlo, Dako, Ft. Collins, CO) and stable GFP-positive
cells were selected. The expression of dominant negative FADD (indicated
by the presence of a lower molecular weight band of the truncated protein),
dominant negative caspase-8, and CrmA was confirmed by Western blot as
described herein. The effect of transfection on RD cell growth was
determined and plating density adjusted before treatment as for other
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.
Apoptosis assays. Cells were detached in PBS/2 mmol/L EDTA,
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, then gently resuspended in 250 AL of
hypotonic fluorochrome solution (PBS, 50 Ag propidium iodide, 0.1%
sodium citrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The DNA content was analyzed by
flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur, San Diego, CA). Twentythousand events were analyzed per sample and apoptosis was determined
from the sub-G0/G1 DNA content (9).
Western blotting. After treatment, cells were detached in PBS/2 mmol/L
EDTA, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and lysed in 50 AL of ice-cold lysis
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 Ag/mL aprotonin,
2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmol/L EDTA, and 1% Triton
X-100]. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein
assay (Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; 50 Ag of
protein were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Separated proteins
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were probed with anti–caspase-3 (31A1067; Alexis
Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), anti–caspase-8 (5D3), anti–caspase-9 (clone
5B4), anti–Smac/Diablo (MBL, Watertown, A), anti–poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (C2-10), anti-Bcl-xL (clone 44), anti-Bcl-2 (clone 7), anti-FADD
(clone 1), anti-CrmA (A71-1), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD;
clone 19), cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; BD Transduction Laboratories, San
Diego, CA), anti–endonuclease G (Axxora, San Diego, CA), anti-HtrA2/Omi

antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (BH1–BH4 containing
proteins; refs. 11, 12). Although mitochondrial expression of Bcl2 and Bcl-xL can prevent cytochrome c release, BH1–3 only
containing proteins, such as Bax and Bak, or BH3-only proteins
Bad and Bid promote cytochrome c release on their activation
and translocation to the mitochondria (13–15). Accordingly, cells
lacking Bax, Bak, or both are resistant to apoptosis that requires
the release of cytochrome c (16–19). However, the exact
mechanism of cytochrome c release or other mitochondrialrelated factors is controversial, and a number of hypotheses have
been proposed (12, 20, 21). Some have suggested that Bcl-2
proteins may form channels in the outer mitochondrial
membrane (22–24), form supramolecular channels (25), or
alternatively interact with and regulate preexisting channels such
as the permeability transition pore (12, 20, 26–28). Recent data
suggest that oligomeric Bax is a component of the mitochondrial
apoptosis–induced channel, and following their interaction, a
selective cytochrome c release pore is formed (29). However, the
consensus of these theories is a requirement for Bax/Bak
activation to promote pore opening and cytochrome c release
whereas Bcl-2/Bcl-xL favors closure and maintenance of the
mitochondrial cytochrome c pool.
Once released from the mitochondria, cytosolic cytochrome c
complexes with pro-caspase-9 and apaf-1 to form the apoptosome,
triggering autoactivation of caspase-9, which subsequently activates caspase-3 and caspase-dependent nucleases. Alternatively,
other proteins released from the mitochondria facilitate caspase
activation by releasing their sequestration from the inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins (11, 20). Also associated with cytochrome c
release is the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DW m)
and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 30).
Indeed, the mitochondria are considered to be the primary source
of ROS (21, 31). Further, the cellular redox state plays an essential
role in regulating ceramide levels (32) and effecting cellular
responses to elevation in ceramide (9), whereas elevated levels of
mitochondrial-derived ROS are downstream effector molecules of
cellular ceramide accumulation (8, 33).
The aim of this study was to further elucidate the apoptotic
signal transduction pathway that is activated on an accumulation
of cellular sphingosine in rhabdomyosarcoma. Direct evidence
is provided for the requirement of Bax activation and its
mitochondrial translocation in sphingosine-mediated apoptosis.
Bax activation and the ensuing selective release of mitochondrial
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm are independent of caspases.
Furthermore, sphingosine-induced cytochrome c release and
apoptosis occur independently of ROS production and loss of
DW m. However, to induce a final commitment to apoptosis,
caspase activation distal to mitochondrial cytochrome c release is
required.

Materials and Methods
Materials. D-erythro-Sphingosine (sphingosine) and fumonisin B1 were
obtained Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). L-erythro-Sphingosine and
L-threo-sphingosine were purchased from Matreya LLC Biochemicals
(Pleasant Gap, PA). z-FA-fmk, z-VAD(OMe)-fmk, z-D(OMe)ED(OMe)-fmk,
and z-LE(OH)HD(OMe)-fmk were purchased from MP Biomedicals

pellets were incubated at 4jC for 10 min in universal immunoprecipitation
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% NP40, 1 Complete protease
inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN)]. The samples
were centrifuged at 10,000  g for 10 min at 4jC, and the supernatant
containing mitochondrial protein was stored at 80jC (35). For analysis of
Bax activation in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, the universal
immunoprecipitation buffer used contained 0.5% CHAPS rather than Triton
X-100/NP40. Proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis as described
herein.
Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential (#W m) by flow
cytometry. RD cells in 12-well plates were loaded with JC-1 (5 Ag/mL;
Invitrogen) for 15 min before the end of the agent treatment period. Cells
were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in PBS
containing 0.25% BSA at a density of 1  106/mL. Samples were
immediately analyzed for the ratio of JC-1 aggregates to JC-1 monomers
by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur).
Evaluation of cytosolic peroxide and superoxide levels. Intracellular
peroxide and superoxide levels were quantified by flow cytometry using the
probes 2¶,7¶,-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium (Invitrogen)
as described elsewhere (9). Briefly, RD cells were loaded with 50 Amol/L
2¶,7¶,-dichlorofluorescein diacetate for 40 min or 10 Amol/L dihydroethidium

(229926; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-Bax (N-20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, La Jolla, CA), anti-Bax (clone 6A7; Sigma), and h-actin
(Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) followed by horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated antibodies (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL)
followed by exposure to CL-Xposure films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) was used
to visualize proteins.
Immunoprecipitation of active Bax: To detect the active form of Bax,
RD cells were collected and lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer as previously
described (34). Briefly, activated Bax was immunoprecipitated from 350 Ag
of whole protein lysate per sample with the monoclonal antibody clone 6A7
(Sigma), which reacts only with Bax in its conformationally active state, and
Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Beads (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United
Kingdom). Isolated active Bax samples were then subjected to Western blot
analysis and identified with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax (N-20; Santa Cruz)
antibody and ECL as described above.
Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractionation. To determine the release
of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondria to the cytosol by Western
blot, PBS-washed RD cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in 100 AL of icecold CLAMI buffer (250 mmol/L sucrose, 70 mmol/L, KCl, 100 Ag/mL
digitonin in PBS). The cells were pelleted (1,000  g for 5 min at 4jC) and
the supernatant containing cytosolic protein was stored at 80jC. The

Sphingosine-Induced Apoptosis in Rhabdomyosarcoma

Figure 2. Sphingosine-mediated apoptosis essentially requires caspase-3 and caspase-9. RD cells were pretreated for 1 h with the pan-caspase inhibitor
z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (PAN ), inhibitor of caspase-3 z-D(OMe)E(OMe)-fmk (C3i ), inhibitor of caspase-9 z-LE(OH)HD(OMe)-fmk (C9i ), or the negative control z-FA-fmk
(each at 50 Amol/L) before exposure to sphingosine (10 Amol/L) for a further 24 h (A and B) or 6 h (C ). The percentage apoptosis was determined from DNA cell cycle
analysis of the sub-G0/G1 content (A ). Cell morphology was also evaluated by light microscopy (B). Caspase-3 activation or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase processing
was determined by Western blot analysis with h-actin as a loading control (C ). Additionally, RD cells overexpressing GFP, CrmA, dominant negative caspase-8
(DNC8 ), or dominant negative FADD (DNFADD ) were exposed to sphingosine (10 Amol/L) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (50 ng/mL) for 24 h. Expressions of
dominant negative FADD, dominant negative caspase-8, and CrmA are depicted by Western blot analysis with h-actin as a loading control (D ). A and D, columns, mean

for 15 min following exposure to sphingosine. Cells were then harvested,
washed twice in PBS and 2¶,7¶,-dichlorofluorescein diacetate or dihydroethidium fluorescence, then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur).
A minimum of 10,000 cells were examined from each sample.
Small interfering RNA system and transfection. Small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette,
CO). The siRNABax consisted of a mixture of four siRNA duplexes targeting
four different regions of the Bax mRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool Bax,
M-003308-00). A pool of four nontargeting siRNA duplexes was used as a
negative control (siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA pool, D-001206-13;
siRNAcontrol). Transfection of cells with siRNA duplexes was done using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To determine the optimum conditions for
Bax down-regulation, cells were transfected with 0, 25, 50, and 100 nmol/L
of siRNAcontrol and siRNABax for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h as recommended by
Dharmacon. The down-regulation of Bax was determined by Western blot.
Subsequently, cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L of siRNAcontrol or

siRNABax for 48 h and, following a change of media, treated for a further
24 h with the aforementioned agents.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as the mean F SE. In all cases,

were done with the Student’s t test and ANOVA where P < 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
Exogenous exposure of rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines to the
sphingolipid sphingosine induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner independent of rhabdomyosarcoma subtype (alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma versus embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma; Fig.

quantified by flow cytometric analysis of the sub-G0/G1 content of
DNA cell cycle histograms. This was consistent with the cleavage of

prevention of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand–mediated
apoptosis (Fig. 2D; ref. 34).
The mitochondrion acts as a central executioner in response to
apoptotic stimuli, allowing signals from various inputs to converge
(21, 31). Sphingosine induced the selective release of cytochrome c
and Smac/Diablo from RD cells exposed to sphingosine (10 Amol/L).
These proapoptotic mediators were observed to be initially released
from the mitochondria 2 h posttreatment and were not accompanied by other factors including apoptosis-inducing factor, endonuclease G, or HtrA2/Omi (Fig. 3A). Release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria into the cytosol following sphingosine (10 Amol/L)
treatment of RD cells was confirmed by confocal microscopy (data
not shown). Inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DW m),
determined by the ratio of JC-1 aggregates to monomers, was not
disrupted until after release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo and
the appearance of apoptosis at 24 h posttreatment (Fig. 3B).
Rottlerin (5 Amol/L) was used as a positive control for DW m
dissipation (37). Additionally, pretreatment of RD cells with bongkrekic acid or cyclosporin A, agents known to prevent permeability
transition pore opening and cytochrome c release (20), did not
disrupt sphingosine-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Sphingosineinduced apoptosis occurred without the elevated production of
superoxide or peroxide measured using the probes dihydroethidium
or 2¶,7¶,-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, respectively, and pretreatment

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the processing of caspase-3, caspase8, and caspase-9 (Fig. 1B and C), and the degradation of X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (data not shown). Sphingosine-mediated
apoptosis was specific to the naturally occurring form of D-erythrosphingosine (here on referred to as sphingosine) because exposure
of the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD to the stereoisomers
L-erythro-sphingosine or L-threo-sphingosine did not result in
significant apoptosis (Fig. 1D). In comparison with rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, murine myoblasts (C2C12), HEK293 cells, and
human foreskin fibroblasts showed resistance to the efficient
induction of apoptosis mediated by sphingosine treatment
(20 Amol/L; Supplementary Fig. S1). Furthermore, inhibition of
ceramide synthase activity with the agent fumonisin B1 did not
inhibit sphingosine-mediated apoptosis, but rather showed a trend
to increase sphingosine-mediated apoptosis, indicating that this
cellular stress response was due to sphingosine accumulation and
not its metabolism to the related molecule ceramide (Fig. 1D;
refs. 5, 36).
Pretreatment with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk, or those specific for caspase-3 and caspase-9 (z-DED-fmk and
z-LEHD-fmk, respectively), abrogated sphingosine-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 2A–C). Overexpression of the viral inhibitor of caspase8, CrmA, dominant negative caspase-8, or dominant negative FADD
did not prevent sphingosine-induced apoptosis despite complete

Figure 3. Sphingosine induces selective release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo without the loss of inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DW m) or production of
ROS. The rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD was treated with sphingosine (10 Amol/L) for 0 to 4 h, and mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions isolated as described in
Materials and Methods. A, mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were examined by Western blot for MnSOD, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF ), HtrA2/Omi, endonuclease
G (EndoG), Smac/Diablo, and cytochrome c (Cyto. C ). B, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DW m) was determined by flow cytometric evaluation of the ratio
of JC-1 monomers (FL1) to JC-1 aggregates (FL2). DW m was determined in RD cells loaded with JC-1 (5 Amol/L) for 30 min before the end of the sphingosine treatment
period. Representative histograms obtained from flow cytometric evaluation of the ratio of JC-1 monomers (FL1) to JC-1 aggregates (FL2). RD cells were pretreated
for 1 h with cyclosporin A (CsA ; 10 Amol/L) or bongkrekic acid (BA; 50 Amol/L; C ) or for 4 h with GSH (5 mmol/L) or catalase (CAT ; 1,000 mU/mL; D) before the
exposure of sphingosine for a further 24 h. The percentage apoptosis was determined from DNA cell cycle analysis of the sub-G0/G1 content. Intracellular superoxide
[dihydroethidium (He )] and peroxide [2¶,7¶,-dichlorofluorescein (DCF )] were determined by flow cytometry as described in Materials and Methods (D ). Western blots
and flow cytometry histograms are representative of three independent experiments.

shown). Induction of sphingosine-mediated apoptosis in RD cells
was inhibited by siRNABax in RD cells when compared with wildtype or siRNAcontrol-treated cells (Fig. 6B). This associates with the
impaired release of cytochrome c observed in RD cells pretreated
with siRNABax compared with siRNAcontrol (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The dysregulation of apoptosis is considered to be one of the six
essential processes that underlie tumorigenesis. Defects in the
activity of proapoptotic molecules are believed to be one
mechanism by which cancer cells obtain a survival advantage
and consequently acquire resistance to current chemotherapeutic
strategies (2). The data presented show that sphingosine induces
the selective release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from the
mitochondria independent of DW m dissipation. Importantly, Bax
translocation to the mitochondria and its activation are required
for sphingosine-mediated cytochrome c release and the ensuing
apoptosis. Although others have suggested the involvement of Bax
in sphingosine-induced apoptosis in different model systems (36),
this is the first direct evidence that Bax is required for efficient
induction of sphingosine-mediated apoptosis. Given that Bax
mutations have been described in humans diagnosed with colon
or gastric cancer (38), our findings that sphingosine-mediated
apoptosis requires Bax activation are of significant importance in
delineating the loss of chemotherapeutic efficacy of agents that use
Figure 4. Sphingosine induces Bax activation and translocation to the
mitochondria. The rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD was exposed to
sphingosine (10 Amol/L) for 0 to 4 h. A, cells were harvested and the
cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions evaluated for Bax expression. Whole
protein lysates (B) or those obtained from the mitochondria and cytosolic
fractions (C ) were immunoprecipitated with activated Bax (clone 6A7). Samples
were analyzed for Bax expression by Western blot using MnSOD as a control for
cytoplasmic contamination. Western blots are representative of three
independent experiments.

of RD cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or catalase did not
prevent sphingosine-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3D). N-Acetylcysteine
or catalase alone did not modulate the basal level of apoptosis in RD
cells. Further, sphingosine-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL overexpression (data not shown).
Cytochrome c release was associated with elevated levels of
Bax within the mitochondrial fraction of RD cells treated with
sphingosine (10 Amol/L). This was initially observed at 2 h accompanied by an associated loss of Bax from the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A).
Total Bax levels were not modulated by sphingosine treatment
(data not shown). Immunoprecipitation with an antibody that
detects the activated form of Bax showed that Bax was activated
after 2-h exposure of RD cells to sphingosine (Fig. 4B). Activated
Bax was found primarily in the mitochondria following 4-h treatment with sphingosine (10 Amol/L; Fig. 4C).
Cytochrome c release and Bax activation were independent of
caspases because pretreatment with the broad caspase-inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk, or those specific to caspase-3 and caspase-9, did not
prevent cytochrome c release (Fig. 5A) or Bax activation (Fig. 5B).
Further, Bax activation occurred in the presence of CrmA,
indicating that this was independent of caspase-8 (Fig. 5C).
Down-regulated expression of Bax in RD cells using siRNA
specific to Bax resulted in the inhibition of sphingosine-mediated
apoptosis. Incubation of RD cells with siRNABax (100 nmol/L) for
48 h resulted in a reduction of Bax expression by f60% compared
with RD cells treated with siRNAcontrol (Fig. 6A) and did not
modulate the levels of other Bcl-2 family members (data not

blot using MnSOD as a control for cytoplasmic contamination. Western blots

and other cell lines (36, 39), in contrast to apoptosis induced in
MCF-7 cells in response to sphingosine that could be attributed
to its conversion to ceramide (6). Collectively, these data indicate
that the downstream signaling pathway stimulated in response to
the cellular accumulation of sphingosine is cell type specific.
Further, this induction of apoptosis is stereospecific because
L-threo-sphingosine and L-erythro-sphingosine did not induce
apoptosis (40).
The mitochondria act as a point of integration for apoptotic
signals originating from both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic
pathways. We have shown that sphingosine induces the selective
release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo in contrast to other
proapoptotic factors, independent of caspases. However, activation
of caspase-3 and caspase-9 distal to the mitochondria are
essentially required to execute sphingosine-mediated apoptosis.
We have used the tetrapeptide z-DEVD-fmk to inhibit caspase-3
activity. Although primarily used as an inhibitor of caspase-3, zDEVD-fmk has also been shown to inhibit the activity of caspase8 (41). However, because RD cells overexpressing dominant
negative caspase-8, dominant negative FADD, or CrmA do not
affect sphingosine-mediated apoptosis, the abrogation of sphingosine-mediated apoptosis following z-DEVD-fmk pretreatment is a
result of caspase-3 inhibition only. Although evidence for caspase8 processing is apparent following treatment of RD cells with
sphingosine as described here and elsewhere in Jurkat T cells (5),
overexpression of CrmA or dominant negative caspase-8 did not
inhibit the resulting apoptosis. These results are in contrast to that
observed following the treatment of Jurkat T cells with phytosphingosine, a structural analogue of sphingosine, where caspase8 activation was required for caspase-3 processing and apoptosis
(42). It is likely that caspase-8 activation therefore represents a
feedback loop to ensure a commitment to apoptosis or is a result of
cellular dysregulation. Furthermore, these data exclude any
contribution to sphingosine-induced apoptosis from death receptor stimulation in this model system.
Several mechanisms have been described by which Bcl-2 family
members may induce cytochrome c release (12, 20, 21). Bax
activation and its insertion into the mitochondria results in its
oligomerization and Bax pore formation. These selective cytochrome c release pores require four Bax molecules and an
estimated pore size of 22 Å, therefore excluding the transport of
larger proteins (23). This theory has been confirmed by the recent
observations of Dejean et al. (29) who have described mitochondrial apoptosis–induced channel to be a putative cytochrome c
release channel induced early in the apoptotic signaling cascade by
Bax. Alternatively, Bax could interact with voltage-dependent anion
channel, adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclophillin D,
components of the permeability transition pore (26–28). Here,
permeability transition pore opening leads to loss of DW m, fluid
influx into the matrix leading to swelling and outer mitochondrial
membrane rupture, and nonselective release of proapoptotic
proteins (12, 20, 21). The data presented are supportive of the
former as a mechanism for cytochrome c release in sphingosinemediated apoptosis because (a) selective release of cytochrome c,
and to a similar extent Smac/Diablo, but not of the higher
molecular weight factors HtrA2/Omi, endonuclease G, or apoptosis-inducing factor, was observed; (b) dissipation of DW m was not
observed until after the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria and the appearance of fragmented DNA; and (c)
mitochondrial ROS were not produced in excess following
sphingosine treatment.

Figure 6. Loss of Bax protects against sphingosine-mediated apoptosis. The
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD was treated with siRNA directed against Bax
(siRNABax; 100 nmol/L) for 48 h. Scrambled siRNA duplexes were used as a
control (siRNAcontrol). Expression of Bax following treatment with siRNAcontrol
or siRNABax was compared with levels in the untreated parental cell line by
Western blot analysis with h-actin as a loading control (A). The percentage of
knockdown was quantified by densitometry and normalized to h-actin levels.
B, RD wt, RD-siRNAcontrol, or RD-siRNABax were treated with sphingosine
(10 Amol/L) for a further 24 h. The percentage apoptosis was determined from
DNA cell cycle analysis of the sub-G0/G1 content. C, cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions were isolated and the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax were
determined by Western blot analysis with MnSOD as a control for cytoplasmic
contamination. A and B, columns, mean of three independent experiments;

sphingosine as a signaling intermediate to achieve their antitumorigenic effects (6).
The administration of exogenous sphingosine resulted in a
rapid time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in all
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines evaluated. This was exclusively due
to the accumulation of cellular sphingosine and not metabolism
to the related proapoptotic metabolite ceramide because
fumonisin B1 did not inhibit sphingosine-mediated apoptosis in
RD cells. Similar findings have been described in Jurkat T cells (5)

Sphingosine-Induced Apoptosis in Rhabdomyosarcoma

Because dissipation of DW m is not observed until after
cytochrome c release and the appearance of fragmented DNA,
loss of DW m seems to be as a consequence of sphingosinemediated apoptosis and not a cause. This is compounded by the
observations that pretreatment with bongkrekic acid or cyclosporin A, agents that promote closing of the permeability transition
pore, did not inhibit sphingosine-induced apoptosis. These
observations are in contrast to etoposide or C2-ceramide exposure
of the T-cell hybridoma cell line 101, where bongkrekic acid
prevented loss of DW m, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis (43).
Additionally, evidence for ROS production, a mediator and cause of
DW m dissipation (44, 45) in response to sphingosine, is lacking.
Using a fluorescence-based approach, an elevated production of
superoxide or peroxide levels within the cell could not be detected.
Furthermore, reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase did not
modulate sphingosine-induced apoptosis in contrast to ceramide
treatment (8, 9, 33).
The current data are also suggestive that not all cytochrome c is
released from the mitochondria and support the opinion that
collapse of DW m is not observed because mitochondrial cytochrome c is maintained at a threshold that permits normal
electron transport and, hence, DW m maintenance. Alternatively, it
is possible that cytochrome c may reenter the mitochondria to
maintain normal mitochondrial respiration (30, 35, 46). Liberation
of cytochrome c in response to sphingosine exposure was also
independent of caspases. Taken with the observation that
cytochrome c release is not accelerated by caspase-8 activation
(data not shown), these data argue against a necessary role for a
mitochondrial feedback loop.
The kinetics of Smac/Diablo release from the mitochondria
seems to be similar to that of cytochrome c release as reported
elsewhere following UV-light exposure (47, 48). However, this does
not necessarily indicate that cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo share
the same mitochondrial release pore (20). Further, loss of X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis was observed following sphingosine
treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (data not shown), likely to
be a result of the liberation of Smac/Diablo from the mitochondria.
Cytosolic Smac/Diablo assists cytochrome c in activating postmitochondrial caspases by sequestering X-linked inhibitors of
apoptosis that inhibit caspase-3 or caspase-9 (11, 20).
The BH3 domain of Bax is hidden within the native protein
but is exposed when Bax is activated (49). Bax activation
occurred rapidly following sphingosine exposure of RD cells first
observed after 2-h treatment. Like cytochrome c release, Bax

activation was not modulated by, and was independent of,
caspases. We have not determined whether Bax activation
following the cellular accumulation of sphingosine requires an
intermediate molecule (e.g., truncated Bid) or is direct. It is
possible that Bid may act directly on the mitochondria,
independently of Bax. However, recombinant tBid has been
shown to mediate the formation of nonselective pores (50, 51)
rather than the selective release of cytochrome c and Smac/
Diablo described in the current study following sphingosine
treatment of RD cells. In support of these observations, Kashkar
et al. (52) showed that UV light–induced ceramide accumulation
stimulated Bax activation independent of caspase-8 and Bid.
Collectively, the data described and those of others (50, 51) lend
support to the concept of direct Bax activation by accumulation
of proapoptotic lipid intermediates.
Loss of Bax expression in RD cells using siRNA targeted against
Bax correlated with loss of apoptosis in response to sphingosine
exposure. Similarly, it has recently been reported that apoptosis
in response to C2-ceramide, C16-ceramide, or UV light–induced
ceramide accumulation treatment essentially requires Bax (52, 53).
However, absolute inhibition of sphingosine-induced apoptosis
was not observed in RD cells and can partly be attributed to the
incomplete depletion of Bax expression. Additionally, we have
shown a failure to completely prevent sphingosine-mediated
apoptosis as HCT116 Bax / cells (data not shown), suggesting
the involvement of an additional factor.
In summary, we present evidence describing a requirement for
Bax activation and translocation to the mitochondria in sphingosine-mediated apoptosis. This permits the selective release of
cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo without loss of DW m and ROS
production, indicating that mitochondrial function is not totally
eliminated. Both activation of Bax and release of cytochrome c are
independent of caspase involvement; however, for subsequent
execution of apoptosis in response to sphingosine, caspase-3 and
caspase-9 processing is essentially required.
