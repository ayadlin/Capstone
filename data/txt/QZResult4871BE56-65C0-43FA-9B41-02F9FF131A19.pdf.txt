ABSTRACT
Clinical resistance to chemotherapy is one of the major problems in breast cancer
treatment. In this study we analyzed possible impact of 22 polymorphic variants on
the treatment response in 324 breast cancer patients. Selected genes were involved
in FAC chemotherapy drugs transport (ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLC22A16), metabolism
(CYP1B1, CYP2C19, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, TYMS, MTHFR, DPYD), drug-induced
damage repair (ERCC1, ERCC2, XRCC1) and involved in regulation of DNA damage
response and cell cycle control (ATM, TP53).
Apart from preexisting metastases three polymorphic variants were independent
prognostic high risk factors of lack of response to FAC chemotherapy. Our results
showed that the response to treatment depended of the variability in genes engaged
in drugs’ transport (ABCC2 c.-24C>T, ABCB1 p.Ser893Ala/Thr) and in DNA repair
machinery (ERCC2 p.Lys751Gln). Furthermore, the growing number of high-risk
genotypes was reflected in gradual increase in risk of the non-responsiveness to
treatment- from OR 2.68 for presence of two genotypes to OR 9.93 for carriers of
all three negative genotypes in the group of all patients. Similar gene-dosage effect
was observed in the subgroup of TNBCs. Also, TFFS significantly shortened with the
increasing number of high-risk genotypes, with median of 54.4 months for carriers
of one variant, to 51.5 and 34.9 months for the carriers of two and three genotypes,
respectively.
Our results demonstrate that results of cancer treatment are the effect of many
clinical and genetic factors. It seems that multifactorial polymorphic models could
be a potentially useful tool in personalization of cancer therapies. The novelty in our
model is the over representation of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients
among the carriers of all unfavorable polymorphic variants. This finding contributes
to the elucidation of the mechanisms of drug resistance in this subgroup of breast
cancer patients.

adhesion and dysregulate apoptotic pathways leading
to highly aggressive and immortal phenotype. Apart
from tumor-related factors, chemotherapy resistance is
associated with patient’s body ability to metabolize and
remove drugs from the body. The factors that can influence
therapeutic potential of a drug are: its reduced transport
into tumor cells, overexpression of efflux transporters and
modified DNA repair systems which remove drug-induced
damage [1, 2].

INTRODUCTION
Clinical resistance to breast cancer chemotherapy
is observed as incidences of disease progression, local
recurrence, primary and secondary tumors at different
locations, and cancer-related mortality. The primary
cause of drug resistance is linked to genetic instability of
tumor cells, which leads to accumulation of mutations and
chromosomal aberrations. These changes often alter cells’

Chemotherapy consisting of 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC
regime) is commonly used in neo-adjuvant or adjuvant
treatment of breast cancer. Resistance to antimetabolite
5-FU may be conferred by alterations in enzymes
involved in fluoropyrimidine metabolism, particularly
enzymes associated with the conversion of 5-FU to the
thymidylate synthase inhibitor FdUMP which is one of
the 5-FU active metabolites. Furthermore, changes in
the thymidylate synthase level or its affinity for FdUMP
have been associated with 5-FU resistance. Anthracycline
doxorubicin (adriamycin) is one of known substrates for
multidrug resistance (MDR1) protein (P-glycoprotein).
Thus, doxorubicin resistance may occur as a consequence
of P-glycoprotein overexpression or also via altered
topoisomerase II activity. The third of FAC drugs,
cyclophosphamide, belongs to the alkylating agents. At
least four categories of resistance to alkylating agents are
known, including increased cytosolic drug inactivation,
enhanced repair of DNA damage and resistance to
apoptosis [3–5].
The choice of therapy in breast cancer is based on
combination of the staging system, age at diagnosis, tumor
histotype and stage, histological grade, hormone receptor
status and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging. To
offer treatment with increased efficacy and low toxicity,
the development of selective therapies based on patient
as well as clinical and molecular tumor characteristics
is necessary. Developing such therapies should be based
on the knowledge of benefits and potential acute and
late toxic effects of each of the therapeutic regimens [4].
Further research is suggested regarding the effectiveness
of therapy, and also the areas such as genetic markers,
chemotherapy regimens, patient quality of life, and
patient views on survival advantages versus treatment
disadvantages [6]. Consideration of the economic
assessment and the intended effects of therapy should be
used for clinical decision-making [7]
The aim of our study was to analyze the possible
impact of wide and comprehensive set of polymorphic
variants in genes with known or potential role in the
activity on FAC drugs on the prediction of long term
survival of the carriers of favorable or unfavorable
polymorphic variants. Analyzed SNPs (single nucleotide
polymorphisms) are present in genes encoding proteins
involved in FAC drugs transport (ABCB1, ABCC2,
ABCG2, SLC22A16), metabolism (CYP1B1, CYP2C19,
GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, TYMS, MTHFR, DPYD),
drug-induced damage repair (ERCC1, ERCC2, XRCC1);
they are also involved in the regulation of DNA damage
response and cell cycle control (ATM, TP53). The genetic
variants addressed in this work had been extensively
studied previously by several teams in terms of impact
on protein function and treatment outcome in many
conditions, including breast cancer [8–12]. These authors
concluded that, apart from clinical factors, patient-related
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

factors are of great importance for the treatment outcome.
Therefore, we assumed that functional polymorphisms in
genes encoding key proteins of metabolic pathways of
FAC drugs, alone or in combinations, may explain some
of the inter-individual variation in the treatment response
in breast cancer patients. The novelty in our model is the
separation of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients
as the subgroup with the worst prognosis. This analysis
should contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms of
drug resistance in this subgroup of breast cancer patients.

RESULTS
Correlation between clinical and genetic factors
and lack of response to FAC treatment
The data regarding treatment outcome was available
for all the patients. In univariate analyses (Table 1) the
strongest factor affecting treatment outcome was the
presence of preexisting metastases, which significantly
increased the lack of treatment response risk (OR 9.67;
95% CI 4.01-23.33; p<0.00001). The other clinical factor
that tended to change the elevated risk was the nodes’
status (OR 2.08 ; 95% CI 0.91-4.71; p=0.078). Neither
tumor size (T) nor triple-negativity were linked to the
lack of response to FAC chemotherapy. Tumor grading,
histotype, patient’ age and neo/adjuvant chemotherapy
setting did not correlate with the responsiveness to
treatment either (Pearson χ2 test p=0.364, p=0.188,
p=0.471, p=0.36, respectively; data not shown).
The polymorphisms in ERCC2 and two ABC
transporter genes, as well as homozygous deletion of
GSTT1 gene changed the lack of FAC response risk. The
absence of wild type allele G for trinucleotide variant
p.Ser893Ala/Thr (rs2032582) in ABCB1 gene decreased
the risk to OR 0.32 (95% CI 0.11-0.93; p=0.036). For
the promotor variant c.-24C>T (rs717620) in ABCC2
gene there was a tendency towards higher risk of lack
of response for rare homozygote TT when compared
to wild type homozygote CC alone (OR 3.86; 95% CI
0.82-18.15; p=0.086) and to combined genotypes with
wild allele (OR 4.29; 95% CI 0.93-19.91; p=0.063).
Significant increase of lack of treatment response risk
was observed for polymorphism p.Lys751Gln (rs13181)
in ERCC2 gene in every combination. Similarly, such
significant risk increase was seen for homozygous deletion
of GSTT1 gene (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.08-4.32; p=0.029).
All above-mentioned factors that influenced the risk of
lack of response to treatment with p-value under 0.100
were included into multivariate analysis. Since the A
and T alleles of variant p.Ser893Ala/Thr (rs2032582) in
ABCB1 gene were the only ones that decreased the risk of
unresponsiveness to FAC chemotherapy, in the next step
of analyses the presence of these alleles was treated as
a reference group. This enabled us to build the model of
solely high-risk genotypes in multivariate analysis. After

stepwise regression where the factors with the highest
p-value were consecutively rejected, the final model of
independent prognostic factors was established. In this
model the factors responsible for high lack of response risk
were: the presence of preexisting metastases (OR 17.34;

of ABCC2 promoter polymorphism c.-24C>T (rs717620)

with the rare G allele of ERCC2 p.Lys751Gln (rs13181)
variant (OR 4.51; 95% CI 1.72-11.82; p=0.002). The
genotypes containing wild G allele of p.Ser893Ala/

responsible in multivariate analysis for increased risk at
borderline statistical significance (OR 3.19; 95% CI 0.9810.39; p=0.053) (Table 2).

groups (Table 4). The results indicate that there was a
strong correlation with triple negative tumors (p=0.0009),
which were more common in patients carrying three
unfavorable genotypes - 75% versus 5.3%, 13.2% and
10.1% for the 0-2 groups, respectively. The other strongly
significant correlation was seen for tumor histotype
(p=0.007). Groups with one to two unfavorable genotypes
were composed mostly of the invasive ductal carcinoma
subtype (90.0%, 69.7% and 75.0%), while in the group
with three variants there was no predominant subtype. The
borderline significance was detected for estrogen receptor
status and tumor grade (p=0.063 and 0.056). It should be
noted that there was no statistically significant correlation
between PR and HER2 status when analyzed separately,
nor between TNM staging and age at the time of diagnosis
either. Because the strongest correlation for the cumulative
groups was detected for triple negative cancers (p=0.0009)
we performed cumulative analysis again for the TNBCs
alone (Table 3). Once again the group of 0’s showed no
cases of lack of treatment response and the combined
group of 0’s and 1’s was used as a reference. These results
indicated that there was a subgroup of triple negative
breast cancers, carriers of all three high-risk genotypes,
that harbored an extremely high risk of FAC treatment
non-responsiveness (OR 34.0; 95% CI 1.20-967.50;
p=0.028).

Cumulative analysis of genetic factors and lack
of response to FAC treatment
In the next step cumulative analysis was performed
to study the effect of simultaneous presence of one,
two, or all three unfavorable genotypes of genetic
polymorphisms established in multivariate analysis as
independent prognostic factors. It should be noted that in
the studied group there were no cases of lack of treatment
response in the group of patients that had none of the
unfavorable genotypes (i.e. the 0’s group). Therefore, the
lack of treatment response risk analyses were conducted
with a combined group of 0’s and 1’s as the reference.
The results show that the growing number of high-risk
genotypes is reflected in the gradual risk increase of the
non-responsiveness to treatment - from OR 2.68 (95% CI
1.37-5.23; p=0.004) for the presence of two genotypes to
OR 9.93 (95% CI 1.28-77.25; p=0.027) for the carriers
of all three negative genotypes. Also, the combined
analysis done for the group carrying more than one highrisk genotype revealed nearly 3-fold higher risk of lack
of response (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.44-5.43; p=0.002) when
compared to the reference group (Table 3).
To clarify whether the group with the worst
prognosis (i.e. the 3’s) was or was not composed of
patients with clinical factors responsible for bad treatment
outcome, correlations were performed between the groups
0-3 and clinical factors established by cumulative analysis,
in order to obtain more exact characterization of these

Potential application of cumulative model –
survival analysis
The definition of treatment failure in our study was
based on the events that occurred within 10 months from
the beginning of FAC chemotherapy. To check possible
application of cumulative model for predicting longterm survival of patients, the TFFS (treatment failurefree survival) analysis was performed. Similarly as in
cumulative analyses, the group lacking unfavorable
genotypes had the best outcome – there were no
events such as disease progression, local recurrence,
metachronous breast cancer, or death in follow-up. For this
reason (censored observations) in Cox proportional hazard
calculations of treatment failure risk the reference group
was the one carrying one high-risk genotype.
The results showed the shortening of TFFS with
the increasing number of high-risk genotypes, with

DISCUSSION

thought to be responsible for resistance to systemic
breast cancer therapy, e.g. decreased drug accumulation
and drug activation, increased inactivation of drug or its
intermediates. Treatment effectiveness is also decreased by
the enhanced DNA repair, impaired recognition of DNA
adducts and defective cell cycle checkpoints resulting in
the increased tolerance to drug-induced damage. Equally
important are host-drug interactions, which include drug
activation/inactivation by normal tissues, as well as toxic
reactions with normal tissues [4]. The activity of transport
proteins is emphasized as one of the crucial factors of

In this study, we genotyped 22 variants in 15 genes
belonging to the main pathways and cellular mechanisms
engaged in transport and activity of three FAC drugs
in order to select genetic changes that are linked to
unfavorable reaction to treatment. Our results show that the
risk of lack of response is modified by variability in genes
engaged in drugs’ transport (ABCB1, ABCC2) and in DNA
repair machinery (ERCC2). These findings are consistent
with the current knowledge. Several mechanisms are

drugs’ bioavailability and disposition in cancer patients
because of the narrow therapeutic index of many cytotoxic
agents [13]. In our study group the modifications in two
ABC transporters, ABCB1 and ABCC2, were linked
to unfavorable outcome. This result provides further
emphasis on the role of cellular efflux systems in the
treatment response. Among the components of this system
the P-glycoprotein encoding gene (ABCB1) is regarded
as the main contributor of multidrug resistance due to a
vast array of substrates, with many chemotherapeutics
included like anthracyclines, taxanes and Vinca alkaloids.
P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in apical surface
of epithelial cells in the colon and small intestine, bile
ductules, kidney proximal tubules and at the blood-tissue
barriers. Its localization confirms the crucial role in the
systemic protection against endogenous compounds and
xenobiotics [14]. Similarly, the ABCC2 transporter is
highly expressed on the apical sides of polarized cells
in the liver, kidneys and small intestine, but not at the
blood-tissue barriers. ABCC2 is involved in excretion
of many compounds like glutathione, its conjugates,
folates and organic anions, mainly with bile. Many
chemotherapeutics are ABCC2 substrates, including
doxorubicin, epirubicin, methotrexate, cisplatin, etoposide,
irinotecan and vincristine [15–17]. In our study group,
variation in the ERCC1 (also xeroderma pigmentosum
group D - XPD) gene was the third independent factor
of treatment responsiveness. ERCC2 encodes a highly
conserved ATP-dependent helicase which is a key ratelimiting protein of the NER (nucleotide excision repair)
machinery. It also takes part in basal transcription being
a part of transcription factor complex. The crucial
function of NER system is the removal of DNA adducts
and crosslinks. These lesions may be caused by many
environmental factors (e.g. UV, tobacco smoke), as well
as by the exposure to many cytotoxic drugs, like cisplatin
or cyclophosphamide. Because of the important role of
ERCC2 it is believed that even mild modifications of its
sequence or structure may be significant for DNA repair
efficiency, cancer risk and clinical effects of cytotoxic
treatment [18–20].
Our results of cumulative analyses further emphasize
the importance of changes that occur simultaneously in
cellular transport (p.Ser893Ala/Thr in ABCB1, c.-24C>T
in ABCC2) and DNA repair systems (p.Lys751Gln in
ERCC2) for the outcome of treatment in breast cancer
patients. It is quite plausible that only the accumulation of
many, individually weak, genetic changes is strong enough
to influence the reaction at the whole body level. There
have been a few reports describing the concurrent impact
of several SNPs on the treatment outcome in breast cancer
patients. The group of Bewick [19] constructed the model
consisting of three polymorphisms in genes of the NER
repair system - ERCC1 C8092A (rs3212986) and ERCC2
p.Lys751Gln (rs13181) and p.Asp312Asn (rs1799793).
They reported significant decrease of median BCSS and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PFS with growing number of adverse genotypes. For the
PFS analysis a similar trend was observed. The worst
prognosis, similarly to our study, concerned the group
carrying all three unfavorable genotypes as compared
to the group lacking these alleles. This effect was seen
in the patients’ group treated with a combination of
cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and vinblastine,
as well as in the group receiving cyclophosphamide,
mitoxantrone and carboplatin. The importance of the
impact of modifications in different pathways on treatment
outcome in breast cancer was reported by Tengström
et al. [21]. Their cumulative model was constructed
from polymorphism p.Lys751Gln (rs13181) in ERCC2
and p.Val16Ala in antioxidant enzyme gene SOD2. The
patients with one or two low-risk genotypes had improved
recurrence-free survival (RFS), breast cancer specific
survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS). It should be
noted that in both cited studies, similar to ours, the wild
homozygote TT of the p.Lys751Gln polymorphism was
at lower risk of treatment failure when compared to other
genotypes. Our cumulative model emphasized that, for the
desired treatment outcome, the activity of export systems
through the ABC transporters and capability to repair
drug-caused DNA damage were essential. Furthermore,
the correlation analyses revealed that in the group with
the worst prognosis the triple negative breast cancers
(TNBC) are more common than in other groups. TNBCs
are negative for estrogens receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2), and are well known for aggressive
behavior and distinct metastatic patterns. These tumors are
characterized by onset at a younger age, high mean tumor
size, higher-grade tumors and sometimes a higher rate of
node positivity. Although triple negative breast cancers
are associated with a generally poor breast cancer specific
outcome, most are not resistant to standard chemotherapy
regimens, but due to their unique molecular profile and
heterogeneity, the development of targeted therapies is
needed [22–24]. Because of the overrepresentation of
TNBCs in the group with worst prognosis in this study,
we wanted to see if our cumulative model was applicable
also to the separation of heterogeneous TNBCs into
subgroups with different prognoses. The unfavorable
cumulative effect was statistically significant for carriers
of all three high-risk variants, which might indicate
existence of a specific molecular subgroup of TNBCs.
Similar to the analysis made for all patients, the group
lacking the high-risk genotypes had no cases of lack of
treatment response. A recent report by Le Du et al. [23]
showed a classification based on molecular subtypes of
TNBC. The authors distinguished five possible subgroups,
each of them defined by a dominant biological function
or pathway. They emphasized the need of developing a
set of biomarkers relevant for TNBCs included in the
treatment options and serving as the tool to overcome
resistance to proposed treatment. Our study indicated the
66799

Oncotarget

existence of chemo-resistant subpopulation of TNBCs
characterized by altered efflux and DNA repair systems.
Le Du et al. concluded that the preselection of chemoresistant population of TNBC is necessary, as such group
can benefit from additional treatment options. It should
be noted that, at present, there are no specific treatment
guidelines for TNBC subgroup and that these cancers are
managed with standard treatment [25].
The potential usefulness of our model seems to be
further confirmed by the analysis of TFFS. One should
note that the groups of responders and non-responders
to FAC regime and, consequently, all predictive factors
were distinguished by the unfavorable events that occurred
within 10 months from the beginning of treatment. In
these settings the developed cumulative model still
enabled us to significantly predict the long-term survival
of the patients, and still the prognosis for the group with
three high-risk genotypes was the worst. At the same time,
the group lacking these genotypes registered no case of
disease progression, local recurrence, metachronous breast
cancer, or death in the follow-up.
As we stated above, worse response to treatment
observed in our cumulative analyses for the carriers of
two and three unfavorable alleles could be the result of
more intense activity of transporters and, consequently,
higher drugs’ clearance combined with improved DNA
repair machinery. Such situation occurs with the presence
of alanine in position 893 (G allele) of p.Ser893Ala/
Thr (rs2032582) ABCB1 variant, T allele of c.-24C>T
(rs717620) ABCC2 promoter variant and with the presence
of glutamine in position 751 (G allele) of p.Lys751Gln
(rs13181) ERCC2 polymorphism. However, the exact
functions of these polymorphic variants remain unclear,
for the results and conclusions coming from different
papers are often contradictory. The trinucleotide change
p.Ser893Ala/Thr (rs2032582) is undoubtedly one of the
most studied variants of ABCB1 gene; similarly, much
attention has been lately given to the ABCC2 promoter
polymorphism c.-24C>T. The lack of conclusion
regarding their functions appears to result from many
factors, including kind of substrate, characteristics of the
studied group and ethnicity. Our hypothesis that G allele
of ABCB1 rs2032582 variant is linked to improved drug
efflux has found support in the study of Kim et al. [26],
who evaluated activity of this transporter’s different alleles
in oocytes of X. laevis. The authors showed that allele A
(threonine) is responsible for much slower transport of
digoxin and daunorubicin when compared to alleles G
(alanine) and T (serine). Consequently, the genotypes with
the G allele are characterized by more efficient removal
of ABCB1 substrates from the cell. Such transporter
modification could therefore greatly decrease drugs’
concentration in the tissues and limit their therapeutic
potential. Simon et al. [27] studied the impact of ABCC2
polymorphisms in the patients with lymphoid malignancies
receiving high-dose methotrexate. In this study, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

presence of T allele of c.-24C>T polymorphism was the
only predictor of methotrexate clearance and volume of
distribution; consequently, the T allele carriers were more
efficient in methotrexate removal from the body. These
results remain in accordance with our observations that
high risk of lack of response to treatment detected for the
carriers of rare TT homozygotes could be explained by
more efficient excretion of FAC drugs being the ABCC2
substrates. The ERCC2 p.Lys751Gln polymorphism had
been extensively studied, among a few others, as the
possible risk factor of developing malignancy, as well
as the modifier of treatment efficiency. It is believed that
glutamine replacement by lysine completely changes
charge configuration in the protein molecule, and this
could be significant given the location of the variant at the
domain important for interaction with helicase activator
[20, 28] As stated before, our results lead to hypothesis
that the repair capacity of ERCC2 protein with Gln751
is improved when compared to that of wild-type T allele
and, therefore, the efficiency of cytotoxic agents becomes
limited. This assumption finds confirmation in the work
of Lunn et al. [29], who measured the frequency of X-ray
induced chromatid aberration in the presence of different
p.Lys751Gln alleles. Their results show that aberrations’
frequency for Lys/Lys is higher than that for Gln/Gln
and, consequently, the risk of sub-optimal DNA damage
repair is also elevated. Similar observations were made
by Bewick et al. [19] who concentrated on the relations
between SNPs in NER components and outcome of
patients with metastatic breast cancer. They showed
that the breast cancer specific survival was significantly
better for the wild-type T allele carriers, and the rare GG
homozygote was considered as adverse genotype. Thus,
the results of Bewick et al. [19] stay in accordance with
our observations that the combined group of TG and GG
carriers was at high risk of lack of response to treatment. It
should be also noted that in our analysis the p.Lys751Gln
variant was the prognostic factor independent from
preexisting metastases (M+). Improved survival for
the wild TT homozygotes in breast cancer patients was
reported also by Chew et al. [30] for the gemcitabine/
cisplatin regime and by Tengstrom et al. [21] for the
patients treated with tamoxifen.
In conclusion, we found significant association
between concurrent polymorphic variants of genes
responsible for drug transport and DNA repair and the
responsiveness of the breast cancer patients to FAC
chemotherapy. Our results also demonstrate the existence
of strong gene-dosage effect, where the risk of lack of
response to treatment is gradually rising with the number
of unfavorable alleles. The findings also demonstrate
that the results of cancer treatment are a combined effect
of numerous factors, including clinical characteristics
of the disease and the common interindividual genetic
variation. It seems that multifactorial polymorphic models
could be useful tools in personalizing cancer therapies.

The presented models could be useful in separating
heterogenous groups of patients sharing general diagnosis
into more uniform subpopulations that could benefit from
different or just slightly modified treatment strategies.

Center in Gliwice only the patients who were diagnosed
with cardiovascular disease or with low left ventricular
ejection fraction did not qualify for FAC treatment. The
drugs were administered intravenously on the first day
of 21-day cycle; there were six planned cycles for each
patient, in adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. The status
of the Silesian most common germline mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (c.68_69delAG, c.181T>G,
c.4034delA, c.5266dupC in BRCA1 and c.5946delT,
c.9403delC in BRCA2 gene) was analyzed for all the
patients in this study. The chosen group was composed
only of non-carriers. All patients filled the informed
consent form and agreed to have their samples used for
research purposes. This study was approved by the local
Bioethical Committee.
Full characteristics of the group under study is given

Genotyping

of unfavorable events such as disease progression, local
recurrence, metachronous breast cancer or death within 10
months from the beginning of chemotherapy. The selected
time period enabled us to analyze the above-mentioned
events that occurred during chemotherapy as well as
during the 6-month period that followed chemotherapy
completion. Group of non-responders consisted of 50
(15.4%) women. Several factors were considered as the
determinants of unfavorable outcome, either related to
tumor (TNM staging, triple negative tumors, tumor grade,
histotype) or patients’ status (age at the time of diagnosis).
Overall survival (OS) was calculated as time (months)
from diagnosis (established as the PCI date) to death from
any cause, or to date of last contact with the patient. Median
overall survival was 57.6 months; during the observation 85
patients (26.2%) from the studied group died. Progressionfree survival (PFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were
established as time (months) from the date of first course of
chemotherapy to date of progression or recurrence (confirmed
by the MRI, CT or ultrasound), respectively, or to date of the
last contact with the patient. Progression was confirmed in
99 (30.6%) patients in median time of 54.1 months, while the
local recurrence was seen in 12 (3.7%) cases and median RFS
was 55.0 months. The time to diagnosis of metachronous
breast cancer was calculated as the time from the date of
first course of chemotherapy to the date of PCI of the second
tumor or to the last contact with the patient. Time to the
development of the following breast cancer was 55.0 months;
such diagnosis applied to 8 (2.5%) women (Table 5).
Treatment failure-free survival (TFFS) was
calculated as time (months) from the beginning of
chemotherapy (date of first course) to disease progression,
recurrence, metachronous breast cancer or death, or to the
date of the last contact with the patient. Median TFFS was
53.5 months.

Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood
leukocytes using the phenol-chloroform method or commercial
DNA isolation kits. Genotyping was performed using
RFLP-PCR, multiplex-PCR or allele-specific amplification
PCR (ASA-PCR) methods. PCR reagents purchased from
Applied Biosystems (AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase) and
EURx (Perpetual Taq Polymerase) were used. Genotyping
of polymorphic variants in ABCB1 (rs1045642), ABCC2
(rs2273697, rs717620, rs3740066), GSTP1 (rs1695), CYP1B1
(rs1056836), CYP2C19 (rs4244285), TYMS (rs34743033),
ERCC1 (rs11615, rs3212986), ERCC2 (rs13181), XRCC1
(rs25487), TP53 (rs1042522), as well as detection of GSTT1/
M1 deletions were performed as described previously [31–
42]. The genotyping methods for polymorphisms in ABCB1
(rs2032582), ABCG2 (rs2231142), MTHFR (rs1801133),
SLC22A16 (rs714368, rs12210538), DPYD (rs1801159) and
ATM (rs1801516) were developed for this study. Primers were
designed with Primer3 web application (http://primer3plus.
com/) or extracted from the literature. RFLP methods
including restriction sites implementation were designed using
the WatCut online tool (http://watcut.uwaterloo.ca/). Primer
sequences and expected amplification products were verified
using NCBI BLAST tools (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.
cgi) and in silico PCR (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr).
PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction
enzymes according to manufacturers’ recommendations. PCR
or digestion products were separated on agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide. For the quality control randomly
selected samples of each genotype were checked by direct
sequencing with full result concordance. Genotyping methods
are summarized in Table 6.

Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of this study was to
identify the genetic and clinical determinants of nonresponsiveness to FAC chemotherapy in breast cancer
patients. Lack of response was defined by the presence

tested for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using
the χ2 test. For all studied genetic variants the genotype
frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and
consistent with published frequencies for Caucasian
population. The only deviation from HWE was the variant
p.Asp1853Asn (rs1801516) in ATM gene (p=0.041;
data not shown). Correlations between clinical factors,
polymorphic variants and the responsiveness to the
treatment were calculated with Pearson χ2 and Fischer twoway exact tests. A dominant, recessive and co-dominant
genetic models were used in all analyses for all the genetic
variants. For the p.Gln141Lys (rs2231142) polymorphism
in ABCG2 gene, we did not find any cases of rare AA
homozygote in our group. Therefore, all calculations done
for this variant compared wild type homozygote CC with
heterozygote CA. p<0.05 was considered as statistically
significant, while p<0.100 was treated as indicator for
trend in given analysis.
Factors that correlated with treatment response in
univariate analyses with p-value below the 0.100 were
included into multivariate analyses. This cut-point was
used to include into the model polymorphic variants with
possible but weak impact on treatment result. The final
model of independent prognostic factors (p<0.05) of
FAC chemotherapy responsiveness was established after
stepwise regression. Cumulative analyses were performed
for the risk of lack of response to treatment connected
with the concurrent presence of one and more independent
prognostic factors. Risk analyses were performed using
logistic regression model where odds ratios (ORs),
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and p values were
calculated.
Survival curves were derived by Kaplan-Meier
method, p values were computed by log-rank test. The
relative risk of death and progression was estimated as
hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
and p value by Cox proportional hazard regression model.
All statistical calculations were performed using Statistica
v.10.0 software (StatSoft).
