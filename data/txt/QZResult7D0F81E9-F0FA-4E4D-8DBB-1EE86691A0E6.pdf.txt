ABSTRACT
The insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), which is often
dysregulated in human cancers, plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis and cancer
development. However, the function and underlying mechanism of IGFBP5 in tumor
growth and metastasis has been elusive, particularly in malignant human melanoma.
Here, we reported that IGFBP5 acts as an important tumor suppressor in melanoma
tumorigenicity and metastasis by a series of experiments including transwell assay,
xenograft model, in vivo tumor metastasis experiment, and RNA-Seq. Overexpression
of IGFBP5 in A375, a typical human melanoma cell line, inhibited cell malignant
behaviors significantly, including in vitro proliferation, anchorage-independent
growth, migration and invasion, as well as in vivo tumor growth and pulmonary
metastasis. In addition, overexpression of IGFBP5 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), and decreased the expression of E-cadherin and the key stem cell
markers NANOG, SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, and CD133. Furthermore, IGFBP5 exerts its
inhibitory activities by reducing the phosphorylation of IGF1R, ERK1/2, and p38MAPK kinases and abating the expression of HIF1α and its target genes, VEGF and
MMP9. All these findings were confirmed by IGFBP5 knockdown in human melanoma
cell line A2058. Taken together, these results shed light on the mechanism of IGFBP5
as a potential tumor-suppressor in melanoma progression, indicating that IGFBP5
might be a novel therapeutic target for human melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

roles in carcinogenesis and cancer development, which
can determine cell survival and regulate cell growth,
migration, and invasion in the development of cancer.
Many preclinical studies indicate that IGFBP5 can
suppress tumor growth and metastasis in various tissues
and contexts, but IGFBP5 can also function as an
oncogene, promoting metastasis in a context-dependent
manner [2-4]. IGFBP5 modulates cell functions by both
IGF-dependent mechanisms, which affect IGF 1 receptor

The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
(IGFBPs) comprise a family of six proteins that
function as critical regulators of the bioavailability and
mitogenic activities of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs).
IGFBP5, the most conserved member of the IGFBPs
family, is frequently dysregulated in human cancers and
metastatic tissues [1, 2]. IGFBP5 has several functional

(IGF1R) signaling, and IGF-independent mechanisms
that do not alter IGF1R signaling [3]. Furthermore, the
different domains of IGFBP5 exert distinct effects on the
tumorigenicity and metastasis of different human cancers
[5, 6].
Despite the increasing number of studies supporting
the role of IGFBP5 in tumorigenesis and metastasis in
several types of cancers, its function in the progression
of cancer is controversial and few studies have provided
mechanistic insights for IGFBP5 in human malignant
melanoma (MM). MM is one of the most lethal forms
of skin cancer, and its incidence has been rising for, at
least, the past 30 years [7, 8]. In patients with MM, tumor
metastasis is highly aggressive and is the leading cause
of mortality. The molecular mechanisms underlying
the development and progression of melanoma are still
not well understood, demonstrating the need for novel
diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets to combat
MM. Other IGFBPs family members, such as IGFBP3,
have been associated with melanoma progression [9-12].
Thus, it is imperative to determine the roles of IGFBP5 in
melanoma.
Our previous study revealed that IGFBP5 exhibited
a distinctly different expression pattern in melanoma cells
with RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) [13]. Hence, in order to
define the role of IGFBP5 in MM growth and metastasis,
we investigated the effects of IGFBP5 in A375 and A2058
human melanoma cells and its potential as a potent tumor
growth inhibitor and anti-metastatic agent both in vitro and
in vivo, using stable overexpression and knockdown cells.
Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by
which IGFBP5 suppresses the proliferation and invasion
of melanoma cells.

human melanoma samples (n = 7), and human metastatic
melanoma samples (n = 8). IHC staining was graded in
four categories: IHC 3 +, 2 +, 1 + and 0 -. Our results
revealed that the mean IHC score for all the melanoma
samples was 1.8 compared to 0.4 for the pigment nevus
tissues (*, p < 0.05). Figure 1C illustrates the strong
staining for IGFBP5 from a primary melanoma sample
compared to the weak staining from a metastatic tissue
and a normal pigmented nevus sample.

IGFBP5 inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and
suppresses tumor growth in vivo
To investigate the role of IGFBP5 in melanoma
progression, we stably transfected the human melanoma
cell line A375 with IGFBP5, which enabling high
expression of IGFBP5, as shown with western blot (WB)
and qRT-PCR (Figure 2, panels A1 and A2). Using this
stable IGFBP5 overexpression (OE) cell line, we assessed
the effects of IGFBP5 on cell proliferation and tumor
growth using CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay.
Our results demonstrate that elevated expression of
IGFBP5 inhibited cell proliferation significantly in vitro.
(Figure 2, panel B and C).
To confirm the inhibitory effects of IGFBP5 on
tumor growth in vivo further, A375 vector control and OE
cells were implanted subcutaneously into the abdomens of
SCID/Beige mice. As a result, all mice developed tumors
at their injection sites. Remarkably, IGFBP5 inhibited
tumor growth in IGFBP5 OE mice significantly (mean
tumor weight: 0.018 ± 0.008 g, *, p < 0.05), whereas the
tumors of the control group grew far larger (mean tumor
weight: 1.73 ± 0.46 g) (Figure 2D).
We further investigated the function of IGFBP5
using stable IGFBP5 knockdown (KD) A2058 cells. The
expression of IGFBP5 decreased by 90% compared to
the control by WB and qRT-PCR analyses. Consistent
with IGFBP5 overexpression results, down-regulation of
IGFBP5 promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth
significantly (Figure S1). Together, these data substantially
demonstrate that IGFBP5 functions as a tumor suppressor
for melanoma tumor growth.

RESULTS
IGFBP5 expression is associated with melanoma
A critical question that has been raised is whether
the expression of IGFBP5 clinically correlates with the
progression of human melanoma. To address this issue,
we studied IGFBP5 expression in HEMn-LP normal
melanocytes and three human melanoma cell lines (A375,
A2058, and UACC903) using quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR). We found that IGFBP5 was highly expressed
in A2058 and UACC903 cells, but low expression in
HEMn-LP and A375 cells relatively (Figure 1A).
In clinical samples, the expression of IGFBP5
in melanoma samples (n = 10) is higher than in normal
pigmented nevus samples (n = 5) significantly by qRTPCR analysis (*, p < 0.05, Figure 1B). Furthermore, we
analyzed the expression of IGFBP5 by hematoxylineosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
in human pigmented nevus samples (n = 7), primary

IGFBP5 represses tumor cell migration, invasion,
and suppresses pulmonary metastasis in vivo
To explore the effects of IGFBP5 on MM
progression, we conducted a series of tumor migration
and invasion assays in vitro with stably transfected A375
OE cells and in vivo in xenograft mice. Up-regulation
of IGFBP5 markedly inhibited cell migration through a
permeable filter (92% suppression) and invasion through
a Matrigel matrix (96% suppression) compared to controls
(*, p < 0.05, Figure 3, panels A and B). Conversely,
down-regulation of IGFBP5 promoted cell migration and

invasion significantly (*, p < 0.05, Figure S2, panels A
and B). Subsequently, we performed pulmonary metastasis
assays in SCID/Beige mice. The pulmonary metastatic
clusters, which presented in the mice with OE cells (2.2 ±
3.3 clusters per lung, *, p < 0.05), were significantly fewer
than those in the control group (52.3 ± 12.3 clusters per
lung), as shown by H&E staining. Notably, overexpression
of IGFBP5 rarely formed secondary metastases in the
lungs of mice, whereas control mice were found to have
extensive and severe metastatic deposits in both lungs
(Figure 3, panel C and D).
We next examined the effects of IGFBP5 KD on
A2058 cell migration and metastasis and observed that
down-regulation of IGFBP5 promoted the formation of
micrometastases in the IGFBP5 KD mice. Pulmonary
metastases were easily detected when endogenous
expression of IGFBP5 was knocked down in A2058 cells
(95.8 ± 38.8 clusters per lung, *, p < 0.05.), whereas fewer
and smaller metastases were observed in scramble control

mice (27.3 ± 20.0 clusters per lung) (Figure S2, panels
C1 and C2). Representative H&E staining of lung tumor
sections and adjacent tissues from IGFBP5 knockdown
mice and control mice was shown (Figure S2, panels D1
and D2). Collectively, these observations indicate that
IGFBP5 negatively regulated the metastatic properties of
melanoma cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.

IGFBP5 suppresses EMT and stem cell features
of tumor cells
Given that IGFBP5 inhibited cancer metastasis
and characteristic morphological changes were observed
in A375 and A2058 (Figure 4A and Figure S3A), we
investigated whether IGFBP5 plays a role in regulating
EMT, a critical event in tumor invasion and progression.
Accordingly, we tested EMT-associated markers with
WB and immunofluorescence and found that A2058 cells

transfected with IGFBP5-targeting shRNA exhibited
prominent mesenchymal-like phenotypes, including
a fibroblast-like morphology. We also observed an
increase in the expression of the mesenchymal marker
vimentin (VIM) and a decrease of the epithelial marker
E-cadherin (ECAD) (Figure S3, panels A - C). However,
overexpression of IGFBP5 in A375 cells led to a
cobblestone morphology in monolayer cultures with tight
cell-cell contacts, characteristic of normal epithelial cells
(Figure 4A), indicating that IGFBP5 most likely reversed
tumor cell EMT. This morphological change accompanied
by an increase in the expression of ECAD and a decrease
in VIM. These results were also confirmed by WB and
immunofluorescence assays (Figure 4B and 4C).
To determine whether IGFBP5-inhibited EMTs
affect the generation of cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells,
we performed qRT-PCR to analyze the master stem cell
transcription factors (TFs) in OE cells. We found that
overexpression of IGFBP5 decreased expression of the
stem cell TFs: NANOG, SOX2, KLF4, and OCT4, at the
transcriptional level (Figure 4D), and the expression of
these stem cell TFs were increased in IGFBP5 KD A2058
cells (Figure S3D). Furthermore, we tested the expression
of the stem cell marker, CD133, in melanoma clones.

IGFBP5-silenced A2058 cells acquired a higher CD133
expression phenotype than control cells (Figure S3, panels
E and F). By contrast, A375 OE cells showed a reduced
CD133 expression phenotype compared to GFP control
cells (Figure 4, panels E and F).
We sequenced the RNA transcriptome of A375
IGFBP5 OE cells using RNA-Seq methodology and
found that the changes in the expression of the EMT
markers were consistent with the variations detected
with both the WB and immunofluorescence assays. The
melanoma CSC markers SOX2, KLF4, and CD271
exhibited reduced expression profiles in the A375
IGFBP5 OE cells compared to empty vector control cells
(Figure 5A). Intriguingly, genes from the “Regulation
of the EMT Pathway” and three other pathways related
to stem cell pluripotency (“Human Embryonic Stem
Cell Pluripotency”, ”Role of NANOG in Mammalian
Embryonic Stem Cell Pluripotency”, and “Role of OCT4
in Mammalian Embryonic Stem Cell Pluripotency”), were
categorized among those most altered with the Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Figure 5B). Taken
together, these results suggest that IGFBP5 inhibited both
the EMT procession and stem cell properties of melanoma
cells.

IGFBP5 affects melanoma growth and metastasis
through inhibition of the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) and p38-MAPK signaling
pathways

VEGFA and MMP9 were correspondingly elevated 18.3fold and 7.5-fold, respectively. These results imply that
IGFBP5 may mediate HIF1α expression to inhibit tumor
growth and metastasis (Figures 6, panels C and D, and
Figures S4, panels C and D).
To determine the molecular mechanisms of IGFBP5
functions in MM, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of
A375 IGFBP5 OE cells using the Ion Proton™ system.
We analyzed the differences in gene expression and gene
function with IPA software, and the results confirmed our
experimental findings (Figure 5, panels A and B). The
IGF1 and p38-MAPK signaling pathways were inhibited
(Figure 5C), and the expression level of the EMTrelated TFs, TWIST1 and ZEB2, is inversely related to
IGFBP5 level. Specifically, the mRNA level of IGFBP5
was low, whereas that of TWIST1 and ZEB2 were high.
Moreover, the expression of the TBC1D3 oncogene,
melanocyte-specific transcription factor/microphthalmia
associated transcription factor (MITF), HIF1α regulated
gene CEBPD, the Rho GTPase member CDC42, growth
factors CTGF and FGF2, and β4 integrin gene ITGB4 all

It is well established that human MM is driven
by the activation of ERK-MAPK signaling, and most
frequently through mutations in the BRAF or NRAS
oncogenes. To test whether IGFBP5 suppressed melanoma
growth and metastasis through inhibition of this signaling
pathway, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK and
p38-MAPK and found that their phosphorylation levels
decreased in A375 IGFBP5 OE cells and increased in
A2058 IGFBP5 KD cells (Figures 6, panels A and B,
and Figures S4, panels A and B). Furthermore, we found
IGFBP5 down-regulated the expression of the hypoxiainducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) in A375 IGFBP5 OE cells,
and the genes targeted by HIF1α, VEGFA and MMP9,
were also dramatically reduced. Similarly, we also
observed that HIF1α increased in IGFBP5 KD cells, and

cellular activities, including cytoskeleton reorganization,

adhesion, and transduction signals that regulate gene
expression, cell growth, cell invasion, and metastasis
(Figure 5A and Table S1).

the signaling pathways that regulate tumor growth and
metastasis. Previous studies report that IGFBP5 influences
pancreatic cancer cell growth and survival via the MAPK
or PI3K pathway, and enhances prostate cancer growth
through activation of the PI3K pathway [25, 26]. It is
widely accepted that MM is driven by the activation of
MEK-ERK signaling pathway, typically through mutations
in the BRAF or NRAS oncogenes, as well as upstream
membrane receptors (e.g. EGFR and IGF1R) [27-32].
p38-MAPKs also play a vital role in the progression of
melanoma [33, 34]. Therefore, we propose that IGFBP5
suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, including
EMT, through the MEK-ERK and p38-MAPK signaling
pathways. We found that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2,
p38-MAPK, and IGF1R was attenuated in IGFBP5 OE
cells, indicating that IGFBP5 inhibited cell proliferation
and metastasis through the IGF1R-dependent pathway.
Conversely, the phosphorylation of these kinases was
enhanced in IGFBP5 KD cells. Furthermore, RNA-Seq
pathway analysis revealed that the IGF1 and p38-MAPK
signaling were inhibited in IGFBP5 OE cells.
The expression of HIF1α, the master regulator
of tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, and development,
increased with the activation of ERK1/2-MAPK pathway

DISCUSSION
Although IGFBP5 has been associated with various
types of cancers, acting in oncogenic or tumor-suppressive
roles, such as breast cancer [4, 6, 14-16], osteosarcoma
[5, 17, 18], head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [19],
neuroblastoma [20], or prostate cancer [21], little is known
about the role of IGFBP5 in human MM. In this study,
we identify IGFBP5 as a novel inhibiting factor of tumor
growth and metastasis in melanoma.
By modulating the tissue distribution of IGFs
and their access to cell receptors, IGFBPs limit the
bioavailability of IGFs, which are implicated in
tumorigenesis [22]. The mechanism of IGFBP5 as a
regulator of the oncogenic receptor ligands IGF-I and -II
is well understood [23, 24], but there are relatively few
studies demonstrating the involvement of IGFBP5 in

in human melanoma [35-38]. We observed that the
expression of HIF1α was inhibited in melanoma cells
overexpressing IGFBP5, which is consistent with the
inhibition of ERK1/2 and MAPK activities. Accordingly,
the expression of the genes targeted by HIF1α, VEGF and
MMPs, were downregulated in IGFBP5 OE cells. Hypoxia
levels were reduced in tumor cells, resulting in decreased
levels of metastasis-promoting genes (MMPs, VEGFs,
FGF2, and CEBPD) thus impairing metastasis [39]. In
addition, HIF1α can induce the expression of IGFBPs
family members, including IGFBP2 [40], IGFBP3 [41],
and IGFBP6 [42], whereas HIF1α expression is regulated
by IGF1 signaling trigged by IGFBP1 and IGFBP2
[40-43]. In our study, we first found that up-regulation
of IGFBP5 decreased HIF1α expression and the other
IGFBPs family members, IGFBP2, IGFBP4, IGFBP6,
and IGFBP7 to some extent in melanoma cells. However,
the relationship between HIF1α and IGFBP5 in human

melanoma cells remains to be verified.
Our data point to a negative correlation between
IGFBP5 expression and EMT phenotypes. EMT is
characterized by the loss of cell polarity, down-regulation
of epithelial proteins most prominently ECAD, and upregulation of the mesenchymal protein, VIM, which has
more recently been implicated in promoting carcinoma
invasion and metastasis [44, 45]. Moreover, an increasing
number of studies show that the progression of EMT can
generate tumor cells with properties of CSCs [46-50].
Vijayan et al. revealed that IGFBP5 enhances epithelial
cell adhesion and protects epithelial cells from TGFβ1induced mesenchymal invasion in NMuMG cells [51].
In our study, we found that overexpression of IGFBP5
inhibits EMT and decreases the key stem cell markers
NANOG, SOX2, OCT4, KLF4, whereas the knockdown of
IGFBP5 leads to a repression of the epithelial phenotype,
inducing a mesenchymal-like phenotype, and increasing

inhibition of melanoma tumor cell growth and metastasis. IGFBP5 represses the proliferative and metastatic capabilities of
cancer cells by (1) inhibiting ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK activities through an IGF1R-dependent signaling pathway and (2) down-regulating
the expression of HIF1α through the transcriptional inhibition of HIF1A gene expression, resulting in a decrease in VEGF and MMPs
expression.

migratory and invasive behaviors and CSC-like properties.
Additionally, we purport that the IGFBP5 might suppress
expression of ZEB2 and TWIST1 at the transcriptional
level from the results of our RNA-Seq analysis. ZEB2
is a member of the zinc finger homeodomain enhancerbinding protein (ZEB) family, and it is both necessary and
sufficient to repress ECAD transcription and trigger the
EMT process in melanoma [52, 53]. For this reason, we
believe that IGFBP5 suppresses EMT, at least partially,
by inhibiting TWIST1 and ZEB2. We found that the CSC
markers SOX2, KLF4, and CD271 (also known as NGFR)
decrease dramatically in IGFBP5 OE cells in our RNASeq data, and stem cell pluripotency-related pathways
were inhibited in our IPA analysis.
Analysis of our RNA-Seq data permitted an
investigation of the causes and molecular mechanisms
of IGFBP5 functions in IGFBP5 OE cells. Foremost,
we found that many top down-regulated genes were
related to cell-cell adhesion, cell-ECM adhesion, ECM
proteins, and growth factors and receptors, which all
promoted tumor growth and progression. Next, we
found that overexpression of IGFBP5 not only resulted
in a widespread oscillatory-like pattern of changes in
gene expression, but also disrupted both canonical and
non-canonical signaling pathways, including the IGF1 signaling, NF-κB signaling, Notch signaling, p38MAPK signaling, EMT, stem cell pluripotency, and
PTEN signaling pathways. This suggests that IGFBP5
may act as a tumor suppressor disturbing a wide array
of signaling pathways. In the future, we plan to utilize
proteomics techniques to further explore the changes of
protein expression profiles and hope to find new factors
that contribute to the inhibition of melanoma progression
induced by the overexpression of IGFBP5.
In summary, we have identified IGFBP5 as a novel
suppressor of the pathogenesis and metastasis of malignant
melanoma by expression-manipulating experiments
(Figure 7). We have demonstrated that IGFBP5 suppresses
melanoma cell growth and metastasis through inhibition
of the ERK1/2 and P38-MAPK pathways. Because
IGFBP5 appears to exert a specific inhibitory effect on
melanoma growth and metastasis, it may qualify as a
useful therapeutic target against melanoma and, perhaps,
other cancers.

generated by transfection with empty pcDNA3.1-NeoEGFP and pRNATU6.1 vectors, respectively. The
transfected cells were selected for 2 weeks with G418,
and individual colonies were isolated and grown. All
constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion
and standard DNA sequencing.

Immunohistochemical staining was used to assess
protein expression levels in the tissues. Formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections collected from
PLA General Hospital were de-paraffinized in xylene,
rehydrated through graded ethanol, and boiled for 10 min
in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval.
Endogenous peroxidase activity was suppressed by
exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The slides
were then blocked with 5% BSA, incubated with diluted
IGFBP5 polyclonal primary antibody for 1 h at 37℃, and
finally incubated with goat-anti-rabbit IgG (PV-9000,
ZSGB-Bio, Beijing, China) for 20 min. The tissue was
visualized with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stain and
counter-stained with H&E for microscopic examination.
Immunohistochemical staining and scoring of the staining
intensity was performed as previously described and
blinded to any clinical data [18]. Briefly, staining score
was rated as 0 (no staining), 1 + (weak), 2 + (moderate)
or 3 + (strong).

Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
Subconfluent cells were transfected with either
pcDNA3.1-Neo-EGFP or pcDNA3.1-Neo-EGFP-IGFBP5
for A375 cells and either pRNATU6.1-Neo-cGFPscramble or pRNATU6.1-Neo-cGFP-shIGFBP5 for A2058
cells. Cells were harvested and sorted according to GFP
fluorescence with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Additionally, the stem cell
surface marker CD133 was used for cell sorting with the
anti-CD133-APC antibody (130-098-829, Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).

Western blots

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Western blots were performed as previously
described [54]. The following antibodies were used:
IGFBP5 (ab4255, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vimentin
(ab8069, Abcam), GAPDH (ab75834, Abcam), HIF1α
(NB100-134, Novus, St. Louis, MO, USA), IGF1RP(Try1135/1136)(3024, Cell Signaling Technology (CST),
Danvers, MA, USA), ERK1/2-P (Thr202/Tyr204) (4376,
CST), ERK1/2 (4695, CST), E-cadherin (3195, CST),
p38-MAPK-P (Thr180/Tyr182) (9215, CST), p38-MAPK
(9212, CST), sheep anti-mouse IgG (ZB-2305, ZSGBBio, Beijing, China), and sheep anti-rabbit IgG (ZB-2301,
ZSGB-Bio). Enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit
(RPN2232, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was
used for the chemiluminescent detection of signals with
BioMax film (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA).

A375 cells transfected with pcDNA3-Neo-EGFPIGRBP5 or empty pcDNA3-Neo-EGFP vector were plated
at 1 × 105 per well into the upper transwell chambers
and 20% FBS-containing medium was placed into the
bottom chamber. After incubation at 37℃ in 5% CO2
for 12 h, the cells remaining at the upper surface of the
membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The cells
that migrated through the 8-mm sized pores and adhered
to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, stained with H&E, and photographed.
Transwell invasion assays were conducted as indicated
for the migration assay, with the exception that the upper
chamber was coated with Matrigel (dilutions range from
1:5 - 1:8, BD Biosciences) in the invasion assay.

Immunofluorescence

Colony formation assays and cell counting kit-8
(CCK-8) assays

Immunofluorescence was performed as previously
described [55]. Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with the primary antibodies IGFBP5,
E-cadherin, and vimentin. Next, the cells were washed
three times with PBS followed by incubation with
Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (A-11037, Life
Technologies) for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells
were examined using a Living Cell Imaging System
(UltraVIEW VoX, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
Cell nuclei were visualized using 2 μM 4, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cells were harvested seeded at 500 cells/well
in 6-well plates and incubated at 37℃ in a 5% CO2,
humidified incubator for 12 days. The medium was
changed in 3-day intervals. At the end of the incubation
period, the cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with crystal violet. Cell viability was measured
for A375 and A2058 cells, both control and those with
stable IGFBP5 expression, using the Cell Counting Kit-8
from Dojindo (CK04, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After treatment with CCK-8,
the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate
reader. The absorbance values from the vector control cells

annotated using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, http://www.ingenuity.
com/). The normalized RNA expression data for IGFBP5
overexpression in A375 cells were deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number,
GSE64693).

Xenograft models
For tumorigenicity detection, 12 female SCID/beige
mice (4-week old, Beijing Laboratory Animal Center,
Beijing, China), were randomly divided into two groups
(6 mice/group). Both groups received subcutaneous
injections of either pcDNA3.1-Neo-EGFP vector control
or A375 IGFBP5 OE cells (1 × 107 cells in 200 μL PBS)
and shRNA vector or shIGFBP5 A2058 cells (5 × 106 cells
in 200 μL PBS), respectively. Tumor growth was evaluated
by measuring the length and width of the tumor mass with
calipers every 3 days. After approximately 30 days, the
mice were sacrificed, and tumor weights were evaluated
with an analytical balance. All of the animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS, in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Statistical analysis
The two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to analyze
the experimental data, including qRT-PCR assay,
cell proliferation, transwell assay, FACS assay and
xenograft model analysis. The two sample Wilcoxon
Rank-Sum test (Mann–Whitney) was used to compare
the immunohistochemical scores for all pigment nevus
samples and melanoma samples. Data were presented
as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). p ˂ 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
