Abstract
mTOR is a critical target for controlling cell cycle progression, senescence and
cell death in mammalian cancer cells. Here we studied the role of mTOR-dependent
autophagy in implementating the antiprolifrative effect of mTORC1-specific inhibitor
rapamycin and ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242. We carried out a
comprehensive analysis of pp242- and rapamycin-induced autophagy in ERas tumor
cells. Rapamycin exerts cytostatic effect on ERas tumor cells, thus causing a temporary
and reversible cell cycle arrest, activation of non-selective autophagy not accompanied
by cell death. The rapamycin-treated cells are able to continue proliferation after drug
removal. The ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor pp242 is highly
cytotoxic by suppressing the function of mTORC1-4EBP1 axis and mTORC1-dependent
phosphorylation of mTORC1 target - ULK1-Ser757 (Atg1). In contrast to rapamycin,
pp242 activates the selective autophagy targeting mitochondria (mitophagy). The
pp242-induced mitophagy is accompanied by accumulation of LC3 and conversion of
LC3-I form to LC3-II. However reduced degradation of p62/SQSTM indicates abnormal
flux of autophagic process. According to transmission electron microscopy data, shortterm pp242-treated ERas cells exhibit numerous heavily damaged mitochondria,
which are included in single membrane-bound autophagic/autolysophagic vacuoles
(mitophagy). Despite the lack of typical for apoptosis features, ERas-treated cells
with induced mitophagy revealed the activation of caspase 3, 9 and nucleosomal DNA
fragmentation. Thus, pp242 activates autophagy with suppressed later stages, leading
to impaired recycling and accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and cell death.
Better understanding of how autophagy determines the fate of a cell - survival or cell
death, can help to development of new strategy for cancer therapy.

Introduction

lipid synthesis [9-12] as well as energy metabolism and
general negative regulator of autophagy and lysosome
biogenesis [13, 14]. Anticancer drugs inhibiting the
activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes potentially
can suppress cancer cell proliferation. In accordance
with this, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and
rapalogs activate a wide spectrum of responses [3, 15-17].
However, although rapamycin inhibits the proliferation
of certain cancer cell lines in vitro, it is not effective in
a large number of human malignancies in vivo [18-23].
In contrast, inhibitors of kinase mTOR domain is more
effective in inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells and
have more pronounced antiproliferative effect on tumor

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
a serine/threonine kinase that integrates a multiple of
extracellular and intracellular signals to drive cellular
growth, proliferation, autophagy or senescence [1-6].
Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1)
promotes cell growth by inducing anabolic and inhibiting
catabolic processes [7]. Numerous observations support
the importance of mTOR pathway in cancer development,

in vivo [24-28] due to suppression of both mTORC1 и
mTORC2 complexes [29].
Autophagy is an important cellular mechanism
responsible for degradation of dysfunctional cellular
organelles and proteins in all living cells, mediat­
ing
the removal of damaged organelles and proteins, which
are digested and recycled for cellular needs again [30].
Autophagy, also known as a reason of programmed cell
death type II (autophagic death), represents an alternative
tumor-suppressing mechanism [31]. Unlike apoptosis,
which is a caspase-dependent process characterized
by chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage and
DNA fragmentation without major structural changes
in cytoplasm, autophagy is a caspase-independent
process characterized by the accumulation of autophagic
vacuoles in the cytoplasm connected with degradation of
proteins, mitochondria, ribosomes and the endoplasmic
reticulum, which precedes the destruction of the nucleus.
In connection with these, autophagy may be important
in determining the response of cancer cells to anticancer
therapy, especially in the case of apoptotic resistance of
many cancers to radio- and chemotherapy [32, 33].
In this paper, we focused on the study of
antiproliferative effect of mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin
and an inhibitor of the mTOR kinase domain pp242 on
tumor rodent E1A + cHa-Ras (ERas) cells. In particular,
we checked how the mTOR inhibitor-induced autophagy
can be involved in suppression of proliferation by
triggering cell death. We showed that rapamycin induced
in ERas cells the process of non-selective autophagy,
whereas pp242 induced selective autophagy. Suppression
of proliferation by mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242 is
due to induction of a specific form of autophagy mitophagy that eventually causes the cell death. By
using immunofluorescence, Western blot and electron
microscopy analyses, we checked mTORC1-4EBP1 and
mTORC1-S6 axes inhibition, ULK1,2 phosphorylation
and activation of autophagy markers - LC3, p62/ SQSTM
and Beclin1 after short-term and long-term treatment of
ERas cells with the inhibitors. Antiproliferative effect of
mTOR inhibitor pp242 is closely connected with strong
inhibition mTORC1-4EBP1 axis, mTORC1-dependent
suppression of ULK1,2-Ser757 phosphorylation, LC3II accumulation and a decrease of Beclin1 expression.
According transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data,
ERas cells shortly treated with pp242 showed numerous
severely damaged mitochondria characterized by an
intense vacuolization and destruction of mitochondrial
cristae. Furthermore, the accumulation of single
membrane-bound autophagic vacuoles, containing
mitochondria (mitophagy) results in the cell death. Despite
the lack of typical picture of apoptotic death (chromatin
condensation, apoptotic body formation, cytoplasmic
blebbing), the ERas-treated cells undergoing mitophagy
revealed both caspase-3, 9 activation and nucleosomal
DNA fragmentation ladder.

PP242 but not rapamycin irreversibly inhibits
proliferation of ERas-transformed cells
Firstly, we assessed a suppression effect of pp242
and rapamycin on the proliferation of ERas-transformed
cells. Rapamycin was used as a very specific allosteric
inhibitor of mTORC1, while pp242 has been shown
to suppress the activity of both TORC1 and TORC2
complexes [18-21]. According to the growth curves data
presented in Figure 1A, pp242 completely suppressed
proliferation after 48 h treatment at concentration 1500
nM, whereas 200 nM Rapa inhibited only by 30%.
Moreover, rapamycin was unable completely suppress
proliferation even at the concentration 20 000 nM (Figure
1B). Similar conclusion follows from MTT assay (Figure
1C). So, after 24 h treatment with pp242, MTT test
reveals a sharp drop in cell viability (up to 90%) that is
characteristic for dying cells. In contrast, according to
MTT assay rapamycin decreases the viability after 24 h
treatment, but the viability restores to 72 h. According
to the clonogenic survival test of rapamycin at low or
very high dose (20 000 nM) does not cause cell death
(Figure 1D). This means that the temporary inhibition of
proliferation by Rapa may be associated with resistance of
ERas cells to rapamycin. The flow cytometry data show an
accumulation of ERas cells in G1-phase after rapamycin
treatment and the appearance of the sub-diploid peak in
pp242 - treated cells, which is a characteristic of cells
undergoing apoptosis. (Figure 1E).
The mTORC1 pathway regulates protein synthesis
and translation by phosphorylation of 70S6 kinase (S6K)
at Thr389 and eIF4E-binding-protein 4EBP1 at Thr37/46.
Western blot data show that rapamycin and pp242 have
different effects on mTORC1-4EBP1 and mTORC1-S6
axes. We compared the short-term (30 min, 2 h, and 4 h)
and long-term (24 h and 48 h) effects of rapamycin and
pp242 on phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP1 (Figure 2A).
Thus, pp242 decreases the phosphorylation of 4EBP1
at Thr37/46 up to about 40% after 30 min treatment
and completely inhibits their phosphorylation after
treatment for 2 h and 4 h (Figure 2B), while inhibitory
effect of rapamycin is much less effective after shortterm treatment. Only 24 h rapamycin treatment results
in suppression of 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Rapa and
pp242 inhibited phosphorylation of S6 protein with a
similar efficacy by about 40% after 4 h, but after 24 h
the inhibition was 80-90% of control values (Figure 2C).
In contrast to pp242, Rapa decreases not only the protein
content per cell, but also reduces the cell size (Figure 3A,
3B).

treatment can be due to the involvement of mTORC2/
PKB/Akt in the regulation of phosphorylation of 4EBP1
[34]. To analyze this possibility, we checked the effect of
pp242 and rapamycin on the phosphorylation of PKB/AktSer473, which is a key mTORC2 target. Data presented

in Figure 4A show that both pp242 and rapamycin inhibit
PKB/Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation but with different
efficiency. Surprisingly, PKB/Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation
has been inhibited after short-term rapamycin treatment
to a greater extent than after pp242. The more complete

inhibition of PkB/Akt-Ser473 by Rapa than by pp242
after short-term treatment indicates that the activity of
mTORC2 is not the cause of a higher level of 4EBP1
phosphorylation as downstream mTORC2/PKB/Akt target
in Rapa-treated cells.
It is known that mTORC2 can be involved in
the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, influencing the
formation of actin stress fibers [35, 36]. We examined

the morphology of actin stress fibers in ERas cells treated
with pp242 and rapamycin (Figure 4B). After pp242 and
rapamycin treatment for 4 h, 12 h and 24 h no obvious
effect on the morphology or abundance of actin stress
fibers was found. Thus, mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242
suppresses ERas proliferation without affecting the actin
stress fibers organization.

staining, the process of autophagy induced by Rapa
proceeds with a normal activity, whereas pp242-induced
autophagy is not accompanied by degradation of p62/
SQSTM protein, which is present until the last time point
of pp242 treatment (Figure 7), indicating severe failure of
late stages of autophagic flux.
Autophagy induced by mTORC1 and mTORC2
inhibitors has very important distinctions: while rapamycin
induced a non-selective autophagy, pp242 triggered in
ERas cells is a selective autophagy, namely mitophagy.
It is known that mitophagy is the first response of cells
to different types of cell stress and damages [49]. To
prove that the pp242-induced autophagy can be classified
as mitophagy, we performed a series of experiments for
analyses of mitochondrial activity. In particular, we used
antibody to cytochrome C (cyt C) to assess the localization
and dynamics of the mitochondrial cyt C, in vivo
mitochondria-specific TMRM dye and the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) of mitochondria structure.
Immunofluorescent analysis of cyt C distribution and
its co-localization with LC3 within the autophagosomes
showed that on early steps there is an accumulation of
mitochondrial cyt C in the autophagosome cavities, but
after 48 h of pp242 treatment cyt C is no longer detected
in the autophagosome vesicles as well as LC3 (Figure 8A).
However, the LC3 staining still present in the cytoplasm at
this time indicating on incompleteness of autophagic cycle
even after complete degradation of damaged mitochondria
as shown by the absence of the cyt C signal. The
distribution of cyt C in rapamycin-treated cells evidences
in favor of preserving the integrity of mitochondria.
According to the intensity of the TMRM staining used
to assess the functional state of mitochondria, Rapa
does not noticeably change its intensity and intracellular
distribution. But pp242 firstly causes the TMRM clustering
and a decrease in the intensity of luminescence but after
24 h-treatment its luminescence quenches (Figure 8B) that
can be considered as a serious damage of mitochondrial
functions induced by pp242.

size of which increase on as treatment of the culture with
an inhibitor continues (Figure 5A). At the same time, after
24 h treatment there can be seen the destructive changes
in the cytoplasm: the appearance of enormous size
empty cisterns, which shift the nucleus to the periphery
of the cytoplasm, and a sharp drop in cell density. After
48 h, there are only sporadic, much flattened large cells
containing large vacuoles with no apparent membrane. In
contrast, in rapamycin-treated cells there are only sporadic
vacuoles within the cells and no visible destruction of the
cell morphology. The long-term treatment with pp242 for
7 days causes the total death of cell population - no single
colony can be seen after the prolonged pp242 treatment
(Figure 5C). However, rapamycin-treated cells, after a
temporary suppression of proliferation, start to divide
again with high efficiency, eventually forming a cell
monolayer with a similar density as in control (Figure 5B,
5C).
To study the activation of autophagy in ERas
cell after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, we used
immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against
LC3 (Atg8) protein, which is a key marker of autophagy.
These data indicate that control ERas cells have a basal
level of autophagy (Figure 6A) likely protecting the
viability of the Ras-expressing cells [42, 43]. The rapid
accumulation LC3 in rapamycin- and pp242-treated cells
has been detected after 4 h, but after 24 h of treatment with
rapamycin there is a significant decrease of LC3 staining,
while in the pp242-treated cells the LC3 signal remains
high (Figure 6A). Comparison of immunofluorescence
and Western blot data for LC3 staining (Figure 6B) shows
that pp242 causes both accumulation of LC3 and intensive
conversion of LC3-I cytoplasmic form to autophagosome
membrane-associated form LC3-II, thereby reflecting
the formation of autophagosomes. Treatment with
pp242 for 4 h leads to a complete conversion of LC3-I
to LC3-II, suggesting a rapid and effective activation
of autophagic process. However, after prolonged pp242
treatment the overall content of LC3 falls, the proportion
of LC3-II form decreases and the ratio of LC3-I to LC3II changes in such a way that characterizes the reduction
of autophagy. Nevertheless, even 24 h and 48 h after
exposure with pp242 the LC3 signal still exists (Figure
2D), indicating the low level of autophagic activity and
the incompleteness of its full cycle. Rapa caused a slight
accumulation of the overall LC3 staining (IF) and a low
level of LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, more noticeable after
24 h (Figure 6B). After 48 h of Rapa treatment process of
autophagy is comparable to control and it does not affect
the process of proliferation.
Another important marker of autophagy is p62/
SQSTM protein, which is involved in the flux of
autophagy by binding to LC3 and then it degrades [44-46].
Thus, the expression level of p62/SQSTM in the cell is
inversely correlated with the autophagic activity [47, 48].
According to immunofluorescence data of p62/SQSTM

PP242-induced mitophagy is terminated by
the cell death with DNA fragmentation pattern
characteristic to apoptosis

controls. The only evident ultrastructural alteration is
a mild vacuolization of mitochondria and less densely
packed mitochondrial cristae (Figure 9B and 9C). The
ERas cells treated with pp242 for 2.5 h showed the
presence of numerous severely damaged mitochondria
characterized by an intense vacuolization and destruction
of mitochondrial cristae (Figure 9D). Furthermore, there
observed accumulation of single membrane-bound
autophagic vacuoles containing the organelle debris that
appeared to be the remains of digested mitochondria. It
is appropriate to note the emergence of numerous tight
contacts between cisterns of the rough endoplasmic
reticulum and mitochondria (Figure 9D). No significant
distinctions found in other intracellular organelles. After
24 h, the cells exhibited accumulation of significantly
extended autophagic vacuoles and large empty membranelacking cavities within the cytoplasm (Figure 9E).

The pp242 inhibitor has been developed as more
efficient than cytostatic rapamycin. It suppresses cell
proliferation by inhibiting the activity of both complexes
- mTORC1 and mTORC2 [19, 29]. Indeed, it has been
repeatedly shown that it is more effective in certain cell
lines by blocking the cell cycle progression [24]. However,
in ERas tumor cell line the anti-proliferative effect of
pp242 is not due to the cell cycle arrest and inhibition of
proliferation but rather a consequence of the activation of
mitophagy followed by rapid cell death.
Almost complete inhibition of the mTORC14EBP1 pathway that leads to a decrease of 4EBP1
phosphorylation closely correlates with the inhibition of
ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser757, which is necessary for
the initiation of autophagy (Figure 10A). It is known that
mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy, and mTOR
inhibitors can induce autophagy even on high level of
amino acids [50]. The mTORC1 directly interacts with

ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex and phosphorylates ULK1
at Ser757 that leads to the disruption of the interaction
between the ULK1 and another activator of autophagy AMPK [37, 51].
We found that the suppression of the mTORC1
activity by rapamycin and pp242 gives very different
kinetics of ULK1-Ser757 phosphorylation, a marker
of the beginning of the autophagic process. At the early
stages, pp242 almost completely inhibited ULK1-Ser757
phosphorylation, whereas Rapa only slightly decreased
its phosphorylation, but 24 h later, the level of ULK1
phosphorylation restored to a control value. Moreover,

after 48 h it becomes even higher than in the control.
In pp242-treated cells, phosphorylation of ULK1Ser757 remains extremely low throughout the time of
inhibitor treatment (Figure 10B). AMPK-dependent
phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser555 is capable of
activating the process of autophagy in various cell lines.
As expected, phosphorylation of ULK1-Ser555 decreases
in the presence of both inhibitors in a similar manner,
thus confirming the dominant role of mTORC1 in the
regulation of autophagy in ERas cells (Figure 10C).
According to our morphological data, pp242induced mitophagy characterizes by the various

nuclei. A weak DAPI staining for DNA, loss of a clear
outline of the nuclear envelope and the appearance of
DAPI-positive material in the cytoplasm support this
conclusion (Figure 11A). These events coincide in time
with the flow cytometry data indicating an accumulation

nuclear DNA degradation. According to morphology data,

destruction neither in the cytoplasm nor in the nuclei.
According to the international nomenclature
describing several types of cell death [31], the autophagic
cell death type II is a caspase-independent. Analysis of
caspase activity showed that pp242 treatment for 4 h and
24 h significantly increases the activity of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 but to a lesser extent than serum deprivation
(Figure 11C). The activity of caspase-8, which may
enforce autophagic process and the formation of active
caspase complexes on p62/SQSTM platform, did not
markedly change after treatment with rapamycin and
pp242. Rapamycin does not activate caspases 9, 3 and
8 types (Figure 11C). In addition to caspase assay, we

assessed acidic phosphatase activity by using Gomori
reaction to characterize the activity of lysosomes. By
comparing the effects produced by rapamycin and
pp242, one can see that in pp242-treated cells the acid
phosphatase activity is much higher than in rapamycinexposed cells (Supplementary Figure 1).
Despite the fact that flow cytometry and DAPI
staining data reveal a DAPI-positive material in the
cytoplasm of pp242-treated cells, no classical features
of apoptotic cell death was identified: chromatin
condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies or blebbing.
However, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis showed
that cells treated with pp242 contain DNA fragments
characteristic for nucleosomal-like DNA degradation.
In contrast, rapamycin does not induce similar DNA
fragmentation (Figure 11B). Thus, the final step of pp242induced mTOR-dependent autophagy is the cell death
accompanied by apoptosis-like DNA degradation.
To activate autophagy, ULK1-ATG13-FIP200
complex should be dissociated from a negative regulator of
autophagy - VPS34-Beclin 1 complex, which is normally
inactivated by binding to anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2
[52]. When Beclin 1 is active, the process of nucleation

takes place thereby giving rise to further development of
the autophagic process. In ERas cells treated with pp242
the Beclin1 content greatly reduced after 30 min and 2
h treatment, whereas rapamycin causes its accumulation
(Figure 12) that is an agreement with the results
characterizing the LC3-I in LC3-II conversion (Figure
6). It seems that apoptosis-induced cas­pase activation can
promote degradation of a number of essential autophagy
proteins, slowing down the autophagic process and
converting pro-autophagic proteins into pro-apoptotic
derivatives.

There are many evidences that mTOR signaling
pathway controls the processes of proliferation, cell
growth, cell death and aging [2, 53-55]. By stimulating the
anabolic processes, mTOR inhibits autophagy, which is
the main catabolic process of cells involved in modulation
of cell death and aging. In particular, mTORC1 inhibits the
formation of autophagosomes by phosphorylation of proautophagic kinase ULK1 thereby preventing its activation
by AMPK kinase. Besides, mTORC1 also phosphorylates

and inhibits ATG13 - a positive regulator of ULK1
[13-15]. Furthermore, mTORC1 inhibits autophagy
by blocking the biogenesis of lysosomes by inhibiting
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription
factor EB (TFEB) [13]. Also, mTORC1 can control
both microautophagy designed for disposal of defective
cytosolic proteins and macroautophagy - a process of
destruction of damaged organelles. This type of autophagy
has protective properties elaborated for saving the cells
from death associated with massive damages.
In this work, we studied whether mTORC1
inhibitor rapamycin and mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor
pp242 are able to suppress proliferation and induce
autophagic death in ERas transformed cells. These cells
are resistant to rapamycin, but pp242 effectively kills
them. Correspondingly, these inhibitors differ in their
ability to cause different forms of autophagy: Rapa
induces a non-selective autophagy, whereas pp242
triggers massive selective mitophagy terminated by
cell death. This correlates with the different kinetics of
mTORC1-4EBP1 inhibition. If pp242 completely inhibits
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in the first hours of treatment,
the effect of rapamycin occurs only after 24 h-treatment,
when according to the expression of markers autophagy
decreases.
Similar data indicating on tight connection
between the inhibition of mTORC1-4EBP1 pathway and
suppression of proliferation have been before obtained
[19, 22, 26-28]. Other results indicate that pp242
suppresses more effectively mTORC1-S6K-S6 pathway
[19, 56, 57]. It is still unclear until now why Rapa and
pp242 have different efficiency of suppression of the
mTORC1 downstream targets and how it is related to their
anti-proliferative effects.
Some authors believe that mTOR kinase inhibitors
like pp242 are more effective as compared to Rapa due
to their ability to inhibit both complexes - mTORC1 and
mTORC2 [18, 20]. However, other studies have shown
that even in mTORC2-deficient cells the mTOR kinase
inhibitors suppresses cell proliferation more effectively
than Rapa [19, 24]. This suggests that the ATP-competitive
kinase inhibitors are able to overcome the rapamycinresistance of mTORC1 in some types of tumor cells. In
addition, although previously thought that Rapa inhibits
only mTORC1 complex but mTORC2 is insensitive to
it, the subsequent data showed that a longer rapamycin
treatment effectively inhibits the mTORC2 activity too
[58]. In our case, however, the kinetics of mTORC2
suppression assessed by PKB/Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation
is similar upon treatment with rapamycin and pp242
that does not allow explaining distinctions in their antiproliferative effect.
Currently, it is unclear what can be used as a
criterion for the anti-proliferative effectiveness of the
rapamycin and rapalogs and the inhibitors of mTOR kinase
domain - the results of inhibition of mTORC1-S6K1-S6 or
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTORC1-4EBP1 axes, as available data are controversial.
In our study, the kinetics of suppression of mTORC1pS6 by both inhibitors is very similar with the maximum
effect on 24 h of treatment. Despite the role of S6K1 and
S6 protein in regulation of cell proliferation, the s6k1
knockout mice do not demonstrate a decrease of protein
synthesis in the liver and muscles as compared with the
control mice [59, 60]. However, if Rapa decreases the
protein content per cell that leads to a reduction of ERas
cell size, the pp242 does insignificantly affect the protein
content and cell size. Given that S6k1-/- S6k2-/- cells did
not show a decrease of the translation level even though
having a defective ribosome biogenesis, some authors
believe that there is a compensatory mechanism of protein
synthesis still not exactly identified [59]. Furthermore,
kinase inhibitor Torin1 has only a minor effect on global
translation in 4EBP1-deficient cells. These data suggest
that mTORC1 controls the global translation machinery
mainly through 4EBP1 [61].
Activity of mTORC1-S6K-S6 pathway seems not
to determine the suppression of proliferation of ERas
cells treated for 24 h and 48 h with Rapa and pp242. At
these time-points, the cells treated with pp242 undergo
a massive death, while Rapa -treated cells rapidly
proliferate, retaining similar levels of pS6. Rapa -treated
cells undergo a short suppression of proliferation, and
then, in parallel with the activation of non-selective
autophagy, restore proliferation. Thus, Rapa-induced
autophagy has a cytoprotective character, moreover, the
autophagy acts as a factor that retain the proliferative
potential of the tumor cells. Such an approach has been
described for stem cells, which after rapamycin treatment
can acquire additional “rejuvenation” and should
proliferate more vigorously [62]. Recently, Leontieva
et al. showed that at low doses (10-30 nM) pp242 and
Torin1 suppress geroconversion in p21-arrested human
cells [63]. Thus inhibiting proliferation by then selves,
mTOR inhibitors can maintain re-proliferative potential
and small-cell morphology.
It is now established that the high level of mTORC14EBP1 activity is characteristic for a number of tumors
[64]. Importantly, ERas cells have a very high level of
mTORC1-4EBP1 activity. One of the mechanisms of
resistance of tumor cells to drugs targeting the mTORC1
can be based on the sustained activity of mTORC14EBP1/eIF4E pathway [65-67].
We first found that the mechanism of antiproliferative effect of pp242 is associated with the
suppression of mTORC1-4EBP1 and activation of
mitophagy followed by cell death. This process is
time-coordinated with the suppression of ULK1,2
phosphorylation at Ser757. Rapa is less effective in
suppression of mTORC1- 4EBP, it transiently suppresses
phosphorylation of ULK1-Ser757 and is not capable of
inducing the mitophagy. This is a mechanistic explanation
of a resistance of ERas transformed cells to rapamycin.

found that even extremely high doses of rapamycin are
not able to induce cell death in tumor ERas cells. Recent
data published advance have demonstrated that those
human cell lines that have the cHa-ras mutations (but not
mutations of Ki- or N-Ras) will die by apoptosis upon
treatment with mTOR kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of
MEK (doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.5619). Our data suggest
that the mTOR kinase inhibitors can be considered as very
promising anticancer agents for the Ras-expressing cells
due to activation of mitophagy followed by apoptotic cell
death.

Very high, non-physiological concentrations of rapamycin
(20 000 nM) can cause apoptotic-like cell death in human
tumor cell line MDA-MB231, but can’t in MCF-7 [68].
The authors did not show whether this effect is caused
by mitochondrial damage similar to that in our work,
although they observed a correlation with the inhibition
of 4EBP1 phosphorylation. However, we were unable to
induce the cell death, even using the same concentrations
of Rapa (20 000 nM). Instead, there was a temporary
suppression of cell proliferation followed by restoration
of proliferation according clonogenic survival data.
Currently, the mitochondria are the key organelle,
which is targeted by the agents that induce mitochondriadependent apoptosis or so-called «intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis» [69]. The main factor for inducing apoptosis
through a mitochondrial pathway is mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) leading to a release
of cyt C inside the cytosol and the caspase activation.
According to IF microscopy, pp242 increases MOMP
within 2,5- 4 h, activates mitophagy and accumulation
of cyt C in the autophagic vacuoles as assessed by
IF and TEM. After 24 h, virtually all cyt C detects in
autophagolysosomes that correlates with apoptotic DNA
fragmentation. In cells treated by pp242 for 48 h, cyt C
is completely destroyed in autophagolysosomes, and
DNA fragmentation process is even more intense. Lesion
of MOMP causes a release of not only cyt C, but also
catabolic hydrolases and activators of caspases that alter
the membrane potential resulting in an energy catastrophe
and cell death. We believe that in ERas transformed cells
pp242-induced death might be classified as a mixed type
of death - autophagy + apoptosis [70].
Autophagy and apoptosis have common links in the
signaling pathways and complement each other [70]. It is
shown that mitophagy is one of the mechanisms by which
a cell can reduce the level of apoptosis [71]. In contrast to
rapamycin, which does not cause mitophagy, in pp242treated cells the destruction of the damaged mitochondria
continues throughout the inhibitor presence. Autophagic
removal of the damaged mitochondria does not prevent
activation of apoptosis and cell death. Moreover, apoptosis
may be an additional factor contributing to the degradation
of proteins involved in the regulation of autophagy thereby
enhancing cell death. Since the content of Beclin 1, a key
regulator of autophagy [72, 73], is greatly reduced in
pp242-treated cells, this dysregulates the coordination
of different stages of autophagy. Recent data show that
AMBRA1, an autophagy activator (Activating Molecule
in BECN1 Regulated Autophagy 1) can be irreversibly
destroyed by calpain- and caspase-dependent pathways
[74]. Correspondingly, cells with mutations in the
AMBRA1 sites cleaved by caspase-3 are resistant
to induction of apoptosis program [75]. In addition,
autophagy can activate apoptosis via the caspase-mediated
cleavage of apoptosis inhibitors IAP [76].

nitrocellulose (0.45µm, Bio-Rad) or PVDF (0.2 µm, EMD
Millipore) membrane. The membranes were blocked in
5% skimmed milk (Santa-Cruz) and probed with primary
antibodies. The blots were washed, incubated with
secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL, ThermoFisher Scientific). Western blot
densitometry was performed using Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.0
software (Media Cybernetics). The optical densities were
normalized to those of control samples.

To assay cell cycle distribution cells flow cytometry
assay of propidium iodide-stained cells was performed as
described before [77].

Growth curves
Cells were seeded at the initial density of 3x104 cells
per 30-mm dish in 3 repeats 24 h before the treatment.
Cells were treated or left untreated and counted in cell
counting chamber every day up to 5-7 days. The medium
was replaced by the fresh one supplemented with 10%
FCS every second day. The growth curve was made based
on the data obtained in 3 independent experiments.

Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown
on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS and
permerabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30
min followed by incubation in blocking solution (5% goat
serum in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST)) for 1
h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted
in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C or rhodamine
phalloidin (R415, Invitrogen) 10 min at 37 °C for actin
staining, washed with PBST, and incubated with secondary
antibodies Alexa-488 and Alexa- 568 (Invitrogen) for 1
h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using
ProLong Gold (P36931, Invitrogen) mounting medium
containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells
were analyzed with Leica TCP SP5 scanning confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems). Confocal images
were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope
(Leica Microsystems) and LAS AF software (Leica

May-Grunwald.
To analyze morphology of ERas cells were grown
on coverslips, washing in PBS and stained 45 sec, as
previously described [77].

MTT viability assay
For experiments, the cells were plated on 96-well
plates at the initial density of 2500 cells per well in
triplicates. After 24 h of growth, the cells were treated
with drugs as indicated in figures. For the test, the cells
were incubated in the conditioned medium with 0.5 mg/ml
MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 37˚C in a CO2-incubator.
The medium was changed to DMSO, and the optical
density was measured at 570 nm using DMSO as a blank
solution. The optical densities were normalized to those of
untreated cells in 24 h after plating.

Caspase activity assay
Evaluation of caspase-3, 8 and 9 activity was
conducted using fluorogenic substrates: for caspase-3
- Ac-DEVD-AMC (EMD Millipore), for caspase-8 Ac-VETD-AMC (Sigma-Aldrich) and caspase-9 - AcLEHD-AFC (EMD Millipore). Cells were lysed in a buffer
containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.5%
IGEPAL, 5 mM DTT for 30 min at 4° C. The reaction
mixture (500 μl) consisted of 50 μg of total protein lysate
in reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS,
1 mM DTT) containing 40 μM fluorogenic substrate. The
reaction was conducted for 1 h at 37° C in the dark. The
emission fluorescence at 460 nm produced by cleaved AcDEVD-AMC was measured after excitation at 360 nm
using fluorimeter GloMax®-Multi Jr. Data are presented
as mean ±S.E.M. of three independent replicates (n = 3).
The values were normalized to those of control samples.

Clonogenic survival
The ability of cells to proliferate at the clonal density
after rapamycin treatment was studied by the method of
clonogenic survival. After 48 h rapamycin treatment the
cells were plated at the density of 200 cells per 30 mm
dish in triplicates. After 5d clones were fixed and stained
with a solution containing 10% acetic acid, 30% ethanol,
and 0.25% brilliant blue. The number of grown up clones
was counted, and dishes were photographed.
