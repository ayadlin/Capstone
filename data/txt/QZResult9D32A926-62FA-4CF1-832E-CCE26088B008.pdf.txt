ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an essentially incurable and rapidly fatal cancer, with
few markers predicting a favourable prognosis. Here we report that the transcription
factor NFIB is associated with significantly improved survival in GBM. NFIB expression
correlates inversely with astrocytoma grade and is lowest in mesenchymal GBM.
Ectopic expression of NFIB in low-passage, patient-derived classical and mesenchymal
subtype GBM cells inhibits tumourigenesis. Ectopic NFIB expression activated
phospho-STAT3 signalling only in classical and mesenchymal GBM cells, suggesting
a mechanism through which NFIB may exert its context-dependent tumour suppressor
activity. Finally, NFIB expression can be induced in GBM cells by drug treatment with
beneficial effects.

INTRODUCTION

neural stem cells [3], oligodendrocyte precursor cells [4],
astrocytes [3, 5] and neurons [5] all have been shown to be
potential cells of origin of GBM in experimental models,
the molecular mechanisms responsible for the lack or loss
of differentiation in this disease are largely unknown.
Nuclear factor one B (NFIB) is a phylogenetically
conserved vertebrate transcription factor that promotes the
differentiation of astrocytes from neural stem/progenitor
cells during the process of gliogenesis in the developing
mammalian central nervous system [6, 7]. Changes in the
levels of NFIB protein directly increase astrogliogenesis NFI transcription factors directly activate glial
differentiation genes, such as glial fibrillary acid protein
(GFAP) [8], myelin basic protein (MBP) [9] and fatty
acid binding protein 7 (FABP7) [10]. In Nfib knockout
mice, NFIB loss results in an increase in progenitor cells
and a reduction and delay in astrocyte differentiation in

Glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV astrocytoma)
is the most common, and most lethal, primary malignant
cancer of the central nervous system [1]. Despite surgery,
radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, patients
with GBM have a median survival of 14.6 months,
with only 10.7% disease-free after two years [2]. Many
genetic alterations and gene expression changes have been
reported for GBM, yet those that contribute significantly
to cellular transformation in this disease remain to be
defined, as are informative molecular biomarkers that
predict patient prognosis. Identification of these may
inform new strategies to treat this almost uniformly fatal
disease.
Histologically, GBM consists of proliferative,
poorly differentiated cells of the glial lineage. While

the hippocampus and neocortex [6, 7, 11]. Conversely,
ectopic overexpression of NFIB in the spinal cord
induces precocious astrogliogenesis [12]. These studies
suggest that NFI genes play a key role in the transition of
proliferating progenitor cells to differentiated astrocytes.
Indeed, loss of one allele of NFIB on chromosome 9p,
leading to NFIB haploinsufficiency, occurs in 39% of
GBM patients [13, 14]. Loss of 9p, which also includes
the tumour suppressor CDKN2A besides NFIB, has been
implicated directly in glioma progression [15]. Moreover,
NFIB over-expression inhibits the transformation of
chicken embryonic fibroblasts by nuclear oncogenes such
as Myc and Jun [16]. Furthermore, Nfib was identified
in insertional mutagenesis mouse screens designed to
identify genes that, when mutated, increase the likelihood
of developing GBM or other brain tumours [17–20]. Taken
together, these observations underscore the possibility
that as an inducer of astrocyte differentiation, NFIB could
function as a tumour suppressor in astrocytic tumours.
Here, we investigated the function of NFIB in human
GBM and the potential clinical relevance of NFIB as a
tumour suppressor in GBM biology.

(free of brain and stromal tissue that might express NFIB).
This revealed that NFIB protein expression was reduced
in patient-derived cell lines established from classical and
mesenchymal GBM compared to those established from
proneural and neural subtype GBM (Figure 1F).
We also investigated the correlation between NFIB
mRNA and protein expression by comparing patientderived GBM cell line qPCR data with densitometric
measurement of our immunoblot results. This confirmed
a direct correlation between NFIB mRNA and protein
expression in GBM (Figure 1G). Collectively, these
findings demonstrate that NFIB expression correlates
inversely with astrocytoma grade and is lowest in
mesenchymal GBM.

NFIB expression and copy number correlates
with glioma patient survival
We next investigated whether there was an
association between NFIB expression and GBM patient
survival. Using TCGA gene expression and patient
survival data [26, 27], we found that GBM patients with
higher NFIB expression survived significantly longer
than those with lower NFIB expression (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, using the independent French dataset [23],
we found that the significant survival benefit associated
with higher expression of NFIB existed for patients
with GBM, astrocytoma and glioma (Figure 2B–2D).
In addition, using the independent Rembrandt glioma
dataset [28], we found that improved patient survival
was also evident when NFIB gene copy number was
considered independently of gene expression (Figure 2E).
Thus, expression of NFIB is a prognostic factor that
predicts improved survival for GBM, astrocytoma and
glioma.

RESULTS
NFIB expression correlates inversely with
astrocytoma grade and is lowest in mesenchymal
GBM
We first investigated whether the level of NFIB
expression corresponds to the degree of differentiation, or
grade, of astrocytoma. We performed qPCR analysis of
WHO grade II/III astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas as
well as WHO grade IV GBM. Compared to grade II/III
tumours, we found that NFIB expression was significantly
lower in GBM samples (Figure 1A). To verify this
finding, we analysed the expression of NFIB mRNA in
three independent larger cohorts for which expression
profiling was available [21–23]. In all three datasets NFIB
expression inversely correlated with astrocytoma grade
(Figure 1B–1D).
GBM is diagnosed using histological criteria.
However, mRNA expression profiling of individual GBMs
has identified patterns of gene expression that have been
used to define distinct molecular subtypes of GBM [24, 25].
The most widely used molecular classification system
describes proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal
subtypes of GBM [25]. We therefore analysed whether
NFIB expression correlated with these subtypes using
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset
of patient tumour tissue, classified as either proneural,
neural, classical or mesenchymal GBM [25–27]. We found
NFIB expression was lowest in mesenchymal GBM and
highest in proneural GBM (Figure 1E). To determine the
level of NFIB protein expressed in GBM, we performed
immunoblot analysis of GBM patient-derived cells lines

Ectopic expression of NFIB in human classical
and mesenchymal GBM inhibits tumour growth
To investigate whether increased expression of NFIB
improves survival in GBM, we next examined the effect
of ectopic expression of NFIB on tumour growth using
two widely used models of human GBM, U87 and U251
cell lines, which express low levels of NFIB compared
to normal human brain. When both cell lines were
transfected with Nfib and injected either subcutaneously or
intracranially they formed xenograft tumours significantly
more slowly, or not at all, in NOD/SCID mice (Figure 3A)
compared to xenografts of control transfected cells. These
two cell lines have a phenotype closest to mesenchymal
GBM [25] and therefore provided initial evidence that
NFIB could suppress tumour formation in this aggressive
tumour subtype. We also repeated this experiment in
primary GBM cell lines of low passage, established from
patients with proneural, neural, classical or mesenchymal
subtype GBM [29–32]. Four patient-derived GBM cell

lines (one of each molecular subtype) were transduced
with a lentivirus expressing either Nfib from the ubiquitin
C promoter or the same vector without the Nfib coding
sequence (Figure 3B). Ectopic expression of NFIB
inhibited the intracranial xenograft tumour growth of both
classical and mesenchymal GBM (Figure 3C) but did not
inhibit the growth of proneural or neural GBM. Indeed,
NFIB expression appeared to enhance the growth of the
neural GBM subtype, behaving more like an oncogene.
These data suggest an interesting and important contextdependent role for NFIB in GBM xenograft growth.

We next sought to identify possible mechanisms by
which NFIB exerted its GBM subtype-specific tumoursuppressive effect. Based on astrogliogenic function
of NFIB during brain development, we reasoned that
NFIB might also up-regulate the expression of glial
differentiation genes in GBM cells. In both established

and III astrocytic gliomas (II/III) and lower in GBM. NFIB expression in patient tissue was determined by qPCR. NFIB expression also

and patient-derived GBM cells, we observed an increase
in expression of GFAP and, to a lesser extent, the
oligodendrocytic markers MBP or CNPase, in response
to ectopic NFIB expression in mesenchymal and classical
GBM lines (Figure 4A). However, we saw a decrease in
GFAP expression in the proneural and neural GBM cell
lines, suggesting a lack of differentiation and supporting
our previous observations in xenograft models where
NFIB afforded no survival benefit and was even oncogenic
in the neural subtype.
To determine if these relationships occur in primary
tissues, we assessed the correlation of NFIB mRNA
expression with astrocyte-associated markers [33, 34]
in the TCGA GBM gene expression dataset [27]. This
analysis revealed that astrocytic markers displayed
a significant positive correlation with NFIB mRNA
expression in the mesenchymal and classical tumours but
not the proneural and neural tumour subtypes (Figure 4B).
These results, together with our GBM cell line models,
provide evidence that NFIB is a potent regulator of glial
differentiation in GBM.
In the developing brain, NFIB has been shown
to regulate proliferation via the Notch/Hes pathway
[35], thus allowing cells to undergo differentiation. We
therefore investigated whether over-expression of NFIB
could reduce GBM cell proliferation. Consistent with

the xenograft survival data, we observed a reduction in
cell proliferation in response to NFIB expression in both
established and patient-derived mesenchymal (U87, U251
and WK1) and classical (RN1) GBM cell lines (Figure 4C).
This effect, however, was not evident for the other two
GBM subtypes (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Tumourigenicity is often paralleled by the ability of
GBM cells to form tumourspheres [36–39], an assay of the
capacity of cells to self-renew. We therefore investigated
the effect of NFIB expression on tumoursphere formation
by GBM cell lines. U87, U251 and WK1 cells were
readily passaged as tumourspheres when transfected with
control plasmids. However when expressing NFIB, they
failed to form tumourspheres and instead grew as adherent
cultures, similar to growth in serum-containing medium
(Figure 4D–4F). In contrast, tumoursphere growth of
the proneural, and classical GBM lines was not altered
by NFIB expression and growth of the neural line was
enhanced (Supplementary Figure 1B).

NFIB activates phospho-STAT3 signalling in
classical and mesenchymal GBM cells
Given the subtype-specific effects of NFIB in GBM,
we sought to identify additional determinants of NFIB
function. Phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) has been shown to

[40], and is required for astrocyte differentiation [41].
We therefore investigated p-STAT3 signalling in
proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal GBM cells
in response to increased NFIB expression. Paralleling
the GBM subtype-specific effects of NFIB, we observed
increased p-STAT3 in classical and mesenchymal GBM
cells, no change in p-STAT3 expression in proneural GBM
cells and a decrease in p-STAT3 in neural GBM cells
(Figure 5A and 5B).
As a control we also investigated ERK and AKT
signalling in proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal
GBM cells as both signalling pathways are frequently
activated in GBM [26, 42]. In contrast to the changes in
p-STAT3 levels that paralleled phenotypic responsiveness
to NFIB, inconsistent changes in both ERK and AKT
signalling pathways were observed in response to
increased NFIB (Figure 5A and 5B). Increased ERK1/2
phosphorylation was seen in proneural, neural, classical
and mesenchymal low-passage GBM cells, but no changes
in U87 and U251 cells. Increased AKT phosphorylation
was evident in proneural and neural GBM lines and
reduced AKT phosphorylation was observed in one of the
mesenchymal lines, with no change in the others. While
changes in both signalling pathways occurred in response
to increased NFIB expression, their failure to parallel
the phenotypic changes observed in the corresponding
GBM cell subtypes suggests that neither pathway has
as significant a role as p-STAT3 in determining NFIBresponsiveness.
These results suggest that p-STAT3 may mediate
NFIB-responsiveness in GBM and could act as a
biomarker of beneficial effect. To investigate this, we
selected an unsubtyped low-passage GBM cell line
(Q1) and ectopically expressed NFIB. Immunoblotting
revealed increased p-STAT3 in these cells in response to
NFIB (Figure 5C). Consistent with this observation, we
also observed increased GFAP expression (Figure 5C)
and reduced cell proliferation (Figure 5D) in response to
increased NFIB expression. Exome sequencing showed
that this cell line was CDKN2A null and expressed
EGFRvIII, mutations most often associated with classical
GBM [25]. Collectively these data suggest that pSTAT3
signalling may be a determinant of NFIB function in GBM.

for the other cell lines we used) we used this line for these
experiments. Q1 cells were treated with 31 different drugs,
each at 10 µM, for 72 hours (Supplementary Figure 2).
NFIB expression was investigated by western blotting,
quantified by densitometry and normalised to β-actin
expression for comparison with vehicle-treated control
cells. Six drugs were found to increase NFIB expression
by more than 30% (Figure 6A). To determine whether
increased NFIB expression was associated with evidence
of differentiation, we also investigated GFAP expression
by western blotting (Figure 6A). Five of the six drugs were
found to also increase GFAP expression by more than
30%. Finally, the top four drugs were investigated for their
effect on cell proliferation (Figure 6B). All were found to
inhibit cell proliferation by between 38 and 67%, with the
most effective drug being AG1478, an epidermal growth
factor receptor inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that
NFIB expression can be induced in GBM cells by drug
treatment, at levels associated with tumour-suppressive
effects.

DISCUSSION
Here we report that NFIB expression correlates
inversely with astrocytoma grade. In GBM, NFIB
expression is lowest in mesenchymal GBM, highest
in proneural GBM and is associated with significantly
improved survival in specific subtypes of this disease.
Importantly, ectopic expression of NFIB inhibits cell
proliferation and tumourigenesis in patient-derived cell
line and xenograft models of classical and mesenchymal
GBM, to a degree determined by the level of NFIB
expression, but not proneural and neural subtype GBM.
The expression of astrocyte-associated markers is
up-regulated in three mesenchymal and two classical
GBM cell lines in response to NFIB expression, which
also occurs in primary tumours of these subtypes.
Interestingly, pSTAT3 is increased only in GBM cells
where ectopic NFIB expression promotes differentiation.
Thus, pSTAT3 signalling may be required for NFIB
to induce differentiation and inhibit tumourigenesis in
GBM. These results demonstrate that NFIB is a positive
prognostic factor for this disease and a tumour suppressor
in a specific subset of GBM.
A surprising finding from our study was the
oncogenic effect of NFIB over-expression in neural GBM.
While reduced expression or inactivation of other tumour
suppressor genes, including PTEN, NF1, ATRX and
DAXX, has been associated with specific GBM subtypes,
we are not aware of any other wild type gene that
behaves as a tumour suppressor in some GBM subtypes
and as an oncogene in others. In addition, the subtypespecific context of NFIB function may indicate potential
mechanisms by which this gene functions in GBM. As

NFIB expression can be induced by drug
treatment of GBM cells and promote beneficial
effects
Because NFIB is rarely mutated in glioma and
at least one copy of the gene is present in over 95% of
GBM [27, 43], we investigated whether NFIB expression
could be increased by drug treatment of GBM cells. As
exome sequencing showed that Q1 cells possessed two
wild type NFIB alleles, (data we did not have available

NFIB expression in proneural and neural subtype GBM
is not reduced, genetic/epigenetic alterations may have
rendered these subtypes insensitive to the action of
NFIB. This is consistent with the neural pattern of gene
expression observed in these two subtypes and may
explain their resistance to the pro-astrocytic effects of
increasing NFIB. In contrast, the lower level of NFIB in
classical and mesenchymal GBM may be due to genetic/
epigenetic changes that reduce NFIB expression in these
two subtypes, resulting in their poorly-differentiated
phenotype yet leaving them sensitive to the effects of
re-expressed NFIB. Interestingly, the oncogenic effect
of NFIB in neural GBM is akin to the action of NFIA in

maintaining the glial progenitor cell pool in the embryonic
spinal cord [12] and perhaps analogously promotes the
propagation of the glioma stem cell compartment in this
subtype. These results demonstrate that targeted treatment
of GBM may need to be considered in conjunction with
GBM subtype/genotype information to ensure not only
effective treatment choice, but to avoid treatments which
may exacerbate tumour growth.
In addition to glioma, NFIB has been linked
with several other cancers, in either an oncogenic or
tumour suppressive context. MYB-NFIB and MYBL1NFIB gene fusions frequently occur in adenoid cystic
carcinoma [44–47]. NFIB is likely to have a tumour

suppressive role independent of MYB(L) in this cancer
as truncation mutations specific to NFIB have also been
found as have translocations involving other partners
(e.g. NFIB-MAN1A1, NFIB-PTPRD, NFIB-NKAIN2,
NFIB-XRCC4 and NFIB-AIG1). HMG2A-NFIB fusions
have been reported in lipomas while other tumourassociated translocations involving NFIB include MPDZNFIB, NFIB-FREM, NFIB-HEATR5B, NFIB-STRN and
NFIB-ZDHHC21. Increased copy number and expression
of NFIB has been reported for small cell lung cancer
[48], prostate cancer [49] and triple negative breast
cancer [50] consistent with an oncogenic role in these
cancers. Conversely, NFIB has a tumour suppressor role
in medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma [51] and cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma [52].
NFIB is one of four genes that comprise the
Nuclear Factor One family of transcription factors
(NFIA, NFIB, NFIC and NFIX) [53, 54]. Like NFIB,

NFIA [55, 56] and NFIX [57] also have been implicated
in glioma. Interestingly, NFIA also can behave as either
a tumour suppressor or an oncogene in glioma. Three
studies provide evidence that NFIA can act as a tumour
suppressor: 1) increased expression of NFIA is observed
in lower grade astrocytomas and is associated with
improved survival [58], 2) NFIA inhibits the oncogenic
transformation of chicken fibroblasts when overexpressed
[16] and 3) inactivation of NFIA by transposon insertion
potentiates tumour formation in the mouse brain
[17–20]. As an oncogene, NFIA has been reported to
promote tumourigenesis in an EGFR-vIII; SV40-LargeTtransformed neural stem cell model of GBM, as well as
driving neural stem cell proliferation and producing a less
differentiated phenotype [55].Thus both NFIA and NFIB
appear to function in a genetic context-dependent manner
as either tumour suppressors or oncogenes.
While recent studies are helping define the genetic

events that give rise to GBM, less is known about the
genetic changes that accompany the progression of lowgrade to high-grade glioma. Our observation that NFIB
expression decreases with increasing glioma grade,
together with the demonstration of its tumour-suppressive
effects in GBM, suggest that NFIB loss may be a
contributory factor in glioma progression. This hypothesis
is supported by a genome-wide study of genetic alterations
associated with grade II and III gliomas revealing loss of
heterozygosity of NFIB with increasing glioma grade
[43]. Similarly, while 90% of GBM arises de novo, there
is evidence that proneural GBM progresses over time to
mesenchymal GBM [59]. Our findings suggest that loss
of NFIB expression may be a contributing factor in this
process.
Although the molecular mechanisms by which
NFIB mediates its anti-tumour effects in GBM remain
to be defined, our findings suggest a role for p-STAT3.
STAT3 signalling is detected in many cancers [60, 61],
including GBM [62] [63–65] and may contribute to
GBM pathogenesis by promoting cell proliferation and
survival, immune suppression, invasion, and angiogenesis.
Recent studies in GBM and other tumours, however,
have suggested an alternative role for STAT3 in tumour
suppression (reviewed in [66, 67]). STAT3, for example,
has been demonstrated to function as a tumour suppressor
in GBMs that have lost PTEN expression [68]. STAT3
is also both necessary and sufficient for astrocyte
differentiation, a function dependent upon phosphorylation
of Tyr-705 [41]. STAT3, like NFIB, also binds the
promoter of GFAP and activates GFAP transcription during
astrocytic differentiation of neural progenitor cells [40].
Interestingly, NFIA facilitates STAT3 binding to the GFAP
promoter through demethylation of the cognate STAT
binding site [69], a function that may extend to NFIB. An
explanation for these divergent outcomes in response to
STAT3 signalling is suggested by an observation by Carro
et al. [70]. This study found that STAT3 signalling alone
was insufficient to transform neural stem cells. However,
malignant transformation to mesenchymal subtype GBM
resulted when STAT3 signalling occurred in combination
with C/EBP signalling. STAT3 signalling therefore may
facilitate different phenotypic outcomes determined
by additional signalling input or interaction with other
transcription factors. Identification of gene promoters
bound by both STAT3 and NFIB may help define key
downstream mediators of the response to combined
STAT3 and NFIB signalling.
Finally, as NFIB is expressed by GBM cells
including GBM cancer stem/tumour-initiating cells [71],
and is rarely homozygously deleted or mutated [27], it may
have therapeutic benefit in GBM if its expression can be
increased. Our pilot drug screen confirmed this, providing
proof-of-principle that induction of NFIB expression in
GBM cells is a potential therapeutic strategy that warrants
further investigation.

Since a defined subset of GBM retains responsiveness
to glial differentiation factors such as NFIB has important
implications for the management of this cancer, as the
ability to induce a more differentiated phenotype is a
potential adjunctive therapy for GBM. Identification of
blood-brain barrier permeable drugs that induce NFIB
expression in GBM cells, together with the identification
of the GBM genotypes in which NFIB has a tumoursuppressive effect, may define a novel therapeutic strategy
to augment the management of this almost uniformly fatal
disease [72].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumour tissue and cell culture
Patient tumour tissue was collected following
informed consent and with human ethics approval from
the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and
Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital human research
ethics committees. All human studies have been performed
in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the
2013 version of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Tumour
tissue was examined by a neuropathologist to determine
tumour type and grade. Patient-derived cell lines [30–32,
73–76] were established as reported previously [29].
These were cultured as adherent monolayers in matrigel
(BD Biosciences)-coated vessels using RHB-A stem
cell culture medium (StemCells Inc) supplemented with
20 ng/ml EGF (Gibco) and 10 ng/ml FGFb (Gibco) or as
tumourspheres using StemPro NSC SFM (Invitrogen).
U87 and U251 cells (obtained from The University
of Queensland and authenticated by PCR-based short
tandem repeat profiling by the QIMR-B DNA Sequencing
and Genotyping facility within the past 12 months) were
maintained in RPMI160 medium (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine,
25 mM HEPES, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured
in 5% CO2 / 95% humidified air at 37°C. GBM subtyping
was performed as described [25].

Cell transfection
N-terminal, HA-tagged Nfib was cloned into the
expression vector pCAGIG (in which GFP is translated

expression vector pF ubc MCS IRES mCherry hygro, a
derivative of pF GVP hygro. U87 and U251 cells were
transfected with pCAGIG HA-Nfib or empty vector and
selected for stable expression of NFIB by three rounds
of FACS for GFP. Patient-derived GBM cell lines were
transduced with lentivirus produced from HEK293FT cells
transfected with pF ubc HA-Nfib IRES mCherry hygro

below the brain surface, 1.6 mm rostral of the bregma
and 0.8 mm right of the midline, using a 25G Hamilton
needle and 2 μl syringe in a stereotaxic frame. Mice were
anaesthetised with 2% isoflurane (Abbott) in oxygen at
a flow rate of 0.8 litres per minute and given 100 μg of
carprofen (Pfizer) subcutaneously for analgesia. The burr
hole through which the cells were injected was sealed
with bone wax and the midline scalp incision was closed
with Vetbond (3M) tissue adhesive. Subcutaneous cell
injection was performed with 500,000 cells in 100 μl PBS,
injected into the right flank with a 21G needle and 1 ml
syringe. Mice were euthanased when they exhibited signs
of significant morbidity (hunching, weight loss, rough coat,
ataxia, head tilt, paralysis). All studies were conducted
according to protocols approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research
Institute. The “Principles of laboratory animal care” (NIH
publication No. 86–23, revised 1985) were followed as
well as the “Australian code of practice for the care and use
of animals for scientific purposes”, 8th edition 2013 and
the “Queensland Animal Care and Protection Act 2001”.

RNA, cDNA and qPCR
RNA was extracted from adherent cell cultures
using TRIzol (Invitrogen), as recommended by the
manufacturer. cDNA was prepared with SuperScript
III (Life Technologies) from 2 μg of DNA-free total
RNA, using random hexamers (NEB Biolabs), and
RNaseH (NEB Biolabs) digestion to remove residual
RNA. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
was performed using SYBR green PCR master mix
(Invitrogen), 2 µM of gene-specific primers (Sigma
Aldrich), 50 ng of cDNA and a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett
Life Science). Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes
at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 20 seconds at 95°C,
30 seconds at 55°C, and 40 seconds at 72°C. Results
were normalised to ACTB. Gene-specific qPCR primers
were NFIB (F899 5′-CACATTGCACAAACCCAGCA-3′
and R1016 5′-CTTCCTGATTGTCCAGAATCTT-3′) and
ACTB (F561 5′-CACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′ and
R688 5′-GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGCC-3′).

Proliferation assays
Proliferation assays were performed using MTS
reagent (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer.
Assays were performed at least three times and
representative results are shown.

Immunoblotting

In vitro limiting dilution assays

Immunoblotting was performed with 30–50 μg
of total cell lysate, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membrane (BioRad). Protein lysates
were prepared using Martin’s lysis buffer (25 mM TrisHCl
pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium
vanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride and 1x protease inhibitors
(cOmplete ULTRA, Roche)). PVDF membranes were
blocked with 5% low fat skim milk powder (Diploma)
in PBS-T. Primary antibodies used were NFIB (Abcam,
ab11989, 1:1000), GFAP (Dako, 1:1000), MBP (Sigma,
1:750), CNPase (Abcam, 1:1000), TUBB3 (Promega,
1:1000), ERK (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), phospho-ERK
(Cell Signaling, 1:1000), AKT (Cell Signaling, 1:1000),
phospho-AKT (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), STAT3
(Cell Signaling, 1:1000), phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705)
(Cell Signaling, 1:1000) and ACTB (Sigma, 1:5000);
secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Dako,
1:3000) and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Dako, 1:3000). Protein
concentration was quantified by Bradford assay.

In vitro limiting dilution assays were performed as
previously described [77].

Drug treatment
1.5 × 105 cells were cultured as adherent monolayers,
in matrigel-coated 12-well plates in serum-free RHB-A
medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml
FGFb. Three hours after plating, cells were treated with
10 µM drug for 72 hours. Drugs were dissolved in DMSO
at a stock concentration of 50 mM, diluted with PBS to a
working concentration of 200 µM and added to cells in
culture at a dilution of 1:20.

Microarray analysis of gene expression
TCGA gene expression data were analysed
using cBioPortal [13, 14] or using log-transformed
gene expression data from the UCSC Cancer Browser
normalised by subtracting the mean value of each gene set.
NFIB expression in the Sun [21], Freij [22], French [23]
and Lee [78] datasets was investigated using ONCOMINE
[79] using probeset 209289_at. NFIB expression data in
the Rembrandt dataset used the same probeset and was

GBM xenograft models
GBM xenograft models were initiated in 5-week
old female NOD/SCID mice housed under pathogen-free
conditions. For intracranial cell injections, 200,000 cells

(unpaired, two-tailed) was used to compare two groups
of independent samples to determine the probability of
difference and ANOVA to compare multiple independent
groups. Correlation coefficients were determined
using parametric linear regression analysis. All graphs
were generated using GraphPad Prism 6. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
