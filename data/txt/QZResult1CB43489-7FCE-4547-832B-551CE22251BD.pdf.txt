ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma are among the most angiogenic tumors. The molecular mechanisms
that control blood vessel formation by endothelial cells (EC) in glioblastoma remain
incompletely understood. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a key regulatory
cytokine that has proinvasive and stemness-maintaining autocrine properties in
glioblastoma and confers immunosuppression to the tumor microenvironment. Here
we characterize potential pro- and anti-angiogenic activities of TGF-β in the context
of glioblastoma in vitro, using human brain-derived microvascular endothelial cells
(hCMEC/D3) and glioblastoma-derived endothelial cells (GMEC) as model systems.
We find that TGF-β induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental
growth factor (PlGF) mRNA expression and protein release in a TGF-β receptor (TβR)
II / activin-like kinase (ALK)-5-dependent manner under normoxia and hypoxia,
defining potential indirect proangiogenic activity of TGF-β in glioblastoma. In parallel,
exogenous TGF-β has also inhibitory effects on EC properties and induces endothelialmesenchymal transition (EndMT) in hCMEC and GMEC. Accordingly, direct inhibition of
endogenous TGF-β/ALK-5 signalling increases EC properties such as tube formation,
von-Willebrand factor (vWF) and claudin (CLDN) 5 expression. Yet, the supernatant of
TGF-β-stimulated hCMEC and GMEC strongly promotes EC-related gene expression and
tube formation in a cediranib-sensitive manner. These observations shed light on the
complex pro- and anti-angiogenic pathways involving the cross-talk between TGF-β
and VEGF/PLGF signalling in glioblastoma which may involve parallel stimulation of
angiogenesis and EndMT in distinct target cell populations.

de novo. Subsequent to this, angiogenesis occurs by the
formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones,
also termed sprouting angiogenesis. Angiogenesis in
glioblastoma is characterized by a neovasculature that has
an erratic basement membrane, reduced pericyte coverage,
decreased astrocytic end feet association with blood
vessels, and altered expression of adhesion molecules on
endothelial cells (EC) [1]. This abnormal vascularization
causes excessive leakiness and promotes edema formation.

INTRODUCTION
Blood supply is an essential prerequisite for
solid tumor growth and therefore a bona fide target for
intervention. The processes by which tumors initiate
and maintain their blood supply are complex and have
remained incompletely understood. Vasculogenesis
is defined as the initial migration and differentiation
of endothelial precursor cells to form blood vessels

One traditional view states that hypoxic tumor cells
release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which
in turn counteracts tumor hypoxia by mediating the growth
of new blood vessels. However, it is unlikely that all blood
vessel formation in glioblastoma is triggered by hypoxiamediated VEGF signaling, notably early in the disease
course when there is probably little hypoxia. Thus, alternative
pathways regulating tumor-associated angiogenesis beyond
hypoxia-driven VEGF synthesis are likely to exist.
Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a prototype
member of a cytokine family involved in most cancerassociated processes. In glioblastoma, immunosuppression
and autocrine control of migration, invasiveness and
stemness have received most attention. However, TGF-β
has also been implicated in angiogenesis in various
model systems including physiological and pathological
angiogenesis. Direct TGF-β signalling on endothelial
cells has been linked mainly to two type I receptors,
activin-like receptor kinases (ALK)-1 and ALK-5. These
two TGFβR I-mediated pathways have been attributed
to opposing effects in response to TGF-β: ALK-1 on
interaction with TβRII induced Smad 1/5 phosphorylation
to induce endothelial cell proliferation [2] and migration
[3] whereas ALK-5 recruited by TβRII induces Smad 2/3
phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the above-mentioned
effects [3]. TGF-β family ligands can interact with coreceptors represented by endoglin (CD105), which is
highly expressed in proliferating endothelial cells, and
betaglycan (TβRIII). In the present study, we investigated
the interaction and dependence of these key signaling
pathways and their role for glioma angiogenesis, using
hCMEC and GMEC as models.

(Supplementary Figure 1B–1C). Interestingly, exposure to
exogenous TGF-β decreased TβRIII and increased ALK-5
at mRNA level and endoglin expression at mRNA and
protein levels. Constitutive pSmad2 was faintly detectable
and not induced by receptor silencing. Constitutive pSmad1/5
levels increased mildly with silencing of endoglin, but not
with silencing of the other receptors (Figure 1E–1F). TGF-β
strongly induced pSmad2, and this induction was attenuated
by the silencing of TβRII, ALK-1, ALK-5 or endoglin,
although not TβRIII. TGF-β strongly decreased pSmad1/5
levels, and this effect was attenuated somewhat by the
silencing of ALK-1, ALK-5, TβRII, TβRIII or endoglin, but
robustly by SD-208. TβRII levels were strongly reduced at 72
h after exposure to TGF-β (Figure 1F).
Under these experimental conditions, exposure
of hCMEC to TGF-β did not induce significant loss
of viability assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion,
cell cycle arrest assessed by PI staining or features of
apoptosis as assessed by annexin V / propidium labeling
(Supplementary Figure 2).

TGF-β induces VEGF mRNA expression and
protein release in hCMEC under normoxic
and hypoxic conditions
We next investigated the effect of recombinant
TGF-β on VEGF expression in hCMEC at increasing
concentrations for 24 h either at normoxia or under
hypoxic conditions (1% O2). VEGF mRNA expression
and protein release were increased approximately 10fold when the cells were shifted to hypoxia. Exposure to
TGF-β increased VEGF mRNA expression and protein
release in a concentration- and time-dependent manner,
more significantly even in hypoxia than under normoxic
conditions (Figure 2A–2D). The lowest concentration
of TGF-β (0.1 ng/ml) did not increase VEGF protein
in normoxia whereas the increase was significant in
hypoxia. The induction of VEGF mRNA expression was
not restricted to a specific VEGF isoform (Figure 2E).
Hypoxia increased PlGF mRNA expression, moreover,
the combination of hypoxia and TGF-β resulted in a
further enhancement compared to hypoxia or TGF-β
alone (Figure 2F). PlGF release was increased by TGF-β
or hypoxia, and the combination was more effective than
either treatment alone (Figure 2G).

RESULTS
hCMEC express TGF-β receptors and
coreceptors
We first analysed whether TGF-β receptors (TβRII,
ALK-1 and ALK-5) and co-receptors (endoglin and
TβRIII) were expressed at mRNA and protein level
in hCMEC. All receptors were expressed at mRNA
level under normoxia and hypoxia, without significant
differences (p > 0.05) (Figure 1A). TβRII, endoglin and
TβRIII protein levels were also unaltered in hypoxia
(Figure 1B–1D). Hypoxia decreased pSmad1/5 and Smad5
levels, but did not affect pSmad2, Smad2, Smad1 or
secreted levels of TGF-β. Like most non-neoplastic cells,
hCMEC released more unprocessed than active TGF-β
(Supplementary Figure 1A).
After confirming the expression of the TGF-β
receptors and ligand, we transiently silenced TβRII, ALK1, ALK-5, endoglin or TβRIII in the absence or presence of
TGF-β. Silencing was confirmed at the mRNA and protein
levels wherever feasible (Figure 1E–1F). The specificity of
silencing ALK-1 versus ALK-5 was verified by RT-PCR

TGF-β-mediated induction of VEGF mRNA
and release in hCMEC involves TβRII, ALK-5
and TβRIII
To determine the relative contribution of TGF-β
receptors and co-receptors to the TGF-β-mediated increase
of VEGF and PlGF in hCMEC, we examined their
modulation by gene silencing of TβRII, ALK-1, ALK-5,
endoglin or TβRIII. TβRII, ALK-1, ALK-5 and endoglin
gene silencing had no effect on constitutive VEGF release

whereas silencing of TβRIII reduced VEGF release by
2-fold. In contrast, when VEGF release was induced by
exogenous TGF-β, silencing of TβRII, ALK-5 or TβRIII
was inhibitory (Figure 3A). Silencing of TGF-β receptors
did not modulate constitutive PlGF release, however
TβRII or ALK-5 depletion significantly inhibited TGF-βinduced PlGF secretion (Figure 3B).
The important signaling function of ALK-5 was
confirmed by pharmacological studies using SD-208
which demonstrated no effect on constitutive VEGF
release, but strong activity against TGF-β-evoked VEGF
gene transcription and protein release (Figure 3C–3D).
This effect was not restricted to specific VEGF mRNA
isoforms (Supplementary Figure 3). Under hypoxic
conditions, SD-208 even inhibited constitutive VEGF
release. The effects of TGF-β and accordingly SD-208
were overall more prominent for PlGF than for VEGF
(Figure 3E–3F).

snail family zinc finger (SNAI) 1 and N-cadherin mRNA
expression and protein levels and pretreatment with SD208 attenuated this increase (Figure 4D–4F). Altogether,
the pattern of decreased vWF [4], CLDN5 [5, 6] with a
concomitant increase in β3 [7] and β5 integrin expression
[8], SNAI1 [5, 9] and N-cadherin [10] are prominent
signs of mesenchymal transition. To dissect the apparent
opposing pro- and anti-angiogenic effects of TGF-β on
hCMEC, we changed the experimental paradigm and
isolated the effect of TGF-β-induced VEGF on tube
formation and cell sprouting by using supernatants of
hCMEC treated with TGF-β for 96 h. These were added
to hCMEC that had been pre-treated with vehicle (DMSO)
or SD-208. Under these conditions, TGF-β-stimulated
supernatant increased tube formation and sprouting. SD208 super-induced these pro-angiogenic effects of TGFβ-stimulated supernatants, consistent with antagonistic
activity of endogenous or supernatant-derived TGF-β and
illustrating how TGF-β and VEGF counterbalance the
endothelial phenotype. Cediranib, a pan-VEGFR inhibitor,
decreased constitutive and TGF-β-stimulated supernatantinduced tube formation in the absence or presence of SD208 (Figure 4G).

Transcriptional regulation of TGF-β-evoked
VEGF release
To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of VEGF
by TGF-β, 2 major transcription factors known to have
multiple response elements on the promoter region
of VEGF, namely, specificity protein (SP1) and early
growth response (EGR)1 were screened for basal mRNA
expression in hCMEC, HUVEC and two glioma cell lines,
U87MG and LN-18 (Supplementary Figure 4A–4B). All
cells expressed SP1 and EGR1. SP1 and EGR1 mRNA
expression decreased with TGF-β exposure at 1–6 h
in hCMEC, however, protein levels were unaffected
(Supplementary Figure 4C). Moreover, the silencing of
SP1 did not alter VEGF mRNA expression or protein
release (Supplementary Figure 4D). Hence, these data
do not support the idea that these transcription factors
are involved in the TGF-β-evoked increase of VEGF in
hCMEC in normoxia.

Endothelial properties of glioblastoma-derived
endothelial cells (GMEC)
Finally we wished to confirm the principle
observations summarized above in freshly isolated CD31positive ex vivo endothelial cells (ZHE-459, ZHE-464,
ZHE-483–2) from glioblastoma tissue. Their endothelial
nature was verified by CD31, CD34, and vWF expression
and by their tube formation capacity (Supplementary
Figure 5A–5B). CD31 mRNA expression in the CD31positive ZHE-464 cells at P5 was reduced approximately
50 times compared to that on the day of isolation whereas
CD31-negative cells did not express CD31 even after 5
passages in endothelial medium, DMEM or neurobasal
medium (Supplementary Figure 5C).

TGF-β induces endothelial mesenchymal
transition (EndMT) and TGF-β-stimulated
supernatant increases tube formation via
VEGFR signaling in hCMEC

Reduction of VEGF receptor levels in hypoxia in
hCMEC and GMEC
The basal expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2
was determined at mRNA and protein levels at normoxia
or after 24 h of hypoxia in hCMEC and GMEC. VEGFR-1
and VEGFR-2 mRNA expression did not change in
hypoxia in hCMEC (Figure 5A). VEGFR-1 protein
levels at the cell surface and after permeabilization were
not altered (Figure 5B). In contrast, there was a strong
decrease in VEGFR-2 protein levels under hypoxia as
assessed by immunoblot (Figure 5C). In ZHE-464 the
mRNA expression of VEGFR-1 increased, whereas
VEGFR-2 was reduced at the mRNA and protein levels in
hypoxia (Figure 5D), suggesting differential regulation of
the VEGF receptors by hypoxia.

We noted that exposure to TGF-β caused changes
in the morphology of hCMEC, making the cells more
elongated and spindle-like in a SD-208-sensitive, thus
presumably ALK-5-dependent manner (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, however, SD-208 alone induced tube
formation, endothelial cell sprouting and expression of
the tight junction marker, CLDN5. Conversely, exogenous
TGF-β blocked the formation of tubes and sprouts
and decreased vWF and CLDN5 mRNA expression.
Pretreatment with SD-208 rescued tube formation,
sprouting, vWF and CLDN5 mRNA expression (Figure
4B–4D). Further, TGF-β increased integrin β3 and β5,

TGF-β control of VEGF release in GMEC

permeability. VEGF, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and
PlGF represent a family of related growth factor molecules
which bind to VEGFR1–3 with varying affinity. VEGF
binding to VEGFR-2 is critically required for vascular
development and sprouting, maturation and differentiation
of endothelial cells [13].
TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine that has
been strongly associated with the malignant phenotype
of glioblastoma and become an attractive target for
pharmacological intervention [14, 15] Here we report
that hCMEC express all known TGF-β receptors and
coreceptors (Figure 1). Their constitutive VEGF release
was largely unaffected by TGF-β receptor gene silencing
except for the effect of TβRIII coreceptor silencing
(Figure 3A), suggesting that TβRIII exerts activity beyond
TGF-β signaling in this paradigm [16]. Exogenous TGF-β
induced VEGF mRNA synthesis and protein release in
hCMEC in a time- and concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 2). The inhibition of VEGF release by ALK-5
gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition using SD208 led to the identification of ALK-5 as the principal
type 1 receptor mediating the VEGF induction by TGF-β
(Figure 3), consistent with the observation that ALK-5–/–
mouse endothelial cells obtained from E9.5 embryos
shows reduced VEGF mRNA expression [17].
TGF-β has been shown to increase PlGF mRNA
and protein release in keratinocytes [18] and in retinal
epithelium [19]. We show that TGF-β induces PlGF
expression and release in endothelial cells in normoxic
(Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 6) and hypoxic conditions
(Figure 3). We further show that ALK5 mediates the
effects of TGF-β on PlGF and that hypoxia may superinduce the PlGF system in the context of glioblastoma.
We observed that VEGFR-2 protein levels in
hCMEC and GMEC decreased under hypoxia (Figure 5).
Up-regulation of VEGFR-1 and down-regulation of
VEGFR-2 at the mRNA and protein levels have been
reported previously in HUVEC exposed to hypoxia [20,
21]. The promoter regions of VEGFR-1 that have HIF
response elements (HRE) were identified whereas no
obvious HRE on the VEGFR-2 promoter region was
detected. It was speculated that the regulation of VEGFR-2
in hypoxia was mediated by an unindentified paracrine
soluble factor [20] or through post-transcriptional
mechanisms [21]. In response to VEGF-A, hypoxic
human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC)
displayed a reduction in VEGFR-2 phosphorylation
compared with normoxia, indicating reduced VEGF-Ainduced receptor activation in hypoxia [22].
We find that TGF-β induces EndMT in hCMEC
and GMEC as determined by a decrease in the expression
of the endothelial markers vWF and CLDN5, inhibition
of tube formation and an increase in the expression of
the mesenchymal markers SNAI1 and N-cadherin in an
ALK-5-dependent manner (Figure 4 and Figure 7). TGFβ-induced mesenchymal transition of mouse pancreatic

Silencing of ALK-5 in the GMEC was confirmed by
RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 5D). Exogenous TGF-β
induced pSmad2 and pSmad1/5 in GMEC, and ALK5 silencing attenuated this effect (Figure 6A). Further,
silencing of ALK-5 reduced constitutive VEGF release
in ZHE-459 and ZHE-483–2. TGF-β increased VEGF in
an ALK-5-dependent fashion in ZHE-459, ZHE-464 and
ZHE-483–2 (Figure 6B). Similarly, silencing of ALK-5
reduced constitutive and TGF-β-evoked PlGF release in
ZHE-459, ZHE-464 and ZHE-483–2 (Figure 6B).

TGF-β induces EndMT and TGF-β-stimulated
supernatant increases tube formation via
VEGFR signaling in GMEC
Tube formation was enhanced by pharmacological
inhibition of ALK-5 in ZHE-459, ZHE-464 and ZHE483–2. Conversely, TGF-β inhibited tube formation,
but pre-treatment with SD-208 rescued tube formation,
confirming that TGF-β inhibits angiogenic properties via
ALK-5 in GMEC, too (Figure 6C). Further, TGF-β induced
EndMT in ZHE-464 and ZHE-483–2. TGF-β reduced the
apico-basal polarity of ZHE-464 and created more spindle
shaped ZHE-483–2 cells. TGF-β decreased vWF and
CLDN5 in ZHE-464 and ZHE-483–2, and concomitantly
increased SNAI1 and N-cadherin in an ALK-5-dependent
manner, very similar to hCMEC (Figure 7A–7B). Similar
to hCMEC, cediranib suppressed the constitutive and TGFβ-stimulated supernatant-induced tube formation in the
absence or presence of SD-208 in ZHE-459 (Figure 7C).

DISCUSSION
Angiogenesis is an important step in the multi-step
formation of solid cancers including glioblastoma. It
requires a crosstalk between tumor and endothelial cells
that is likely to involve much more complex interactions
than merely hypoxic tumor cell-derived VEGF acting
on endothelial cells. Targeting blood vessel formation in
glioblastoma has been the favored therapeutic strategy
in clinical drug development in the first decade of this
century. Yet, the failure of multiple drugs acting not only
on VEGF or its receptors, but also on alternative targets
including integrins has imposed a brake on further efforts
of targeting angiogenesis and instead called for a better
understanding of the processes that govern glioblastomaassociated blood vessel formation [11].
Primary resistance to or escape from anti-angiogenic
therapy in glioblastoma is likely to be mediated by
compensatory activation of multiple pro-angiogenic
pathways and shaped by complex interactions between
tumor cells and their microenvironment [12]. VEGF
remains to be the major molecule thought to drive
endothelial cell growth, migration, vessel dilation and

microvascular endothelial cells required Smad-dependent
cooperative activation of Rho signals and MRTF-A [23].
TGF-β promoted SNAI1-mediated EndMT through
convergence of Smad-dependent and Smad-independent
signalling in human cutaneous microvascular endothelial
cells [24]. Sustained elevation of SNAI1 has been
suggested to promote a glial-mesenchymal transition in
gliomas after radiation [25].
VEGF and TGF-β signalling may induce a plethora
of gene expression changes observed in glioblastoma
vessels in vivo [26]. The dual effects of TGF-β on
biological aspects of angiogenesis characterized here
(Figure 8) makes the consequences of therapeutic
targeting of either pathway difficult to predict. It must

be acknowledged that therapeutic targeting of VEGF
receptors by cediranib has failed in glioblastoma [27]
whereas bevacizumab, while convincingly delaying
disease progression, also did not impact overall survival
[28, 29]. Yet, it has remained uncertain to what extent
these drugs truly reached their desired site of action
which must include the tumor microenvironment. Blood
brain barrier permeability may have limited the efficacy
of cediranib and bevacizumab would a priori only
be able to scavenge humoral VEGF, but probably not
be able to prevent autocrine signaling that is likely to be
relevant in glioblastoma, too [30]. Accordingly, control
of VEGF synthesis and release is still a valid target in
glioblastoma.

Figure 8: Two pathways of TGF-β/ALK-5 signalling in hCMEC and GMEC. TGF-β can increase VEGF/PlGF secretion via
the ALK-5 pathway and create a pro-angiogenic milieu for the tumor or induce EndMT by decreasing endothelial properties and increasing
the mesenchymal signatures for the tumor to become potentially more invasive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

(130–091-935, Miltenyi biotech) were added per 107
cells. After 15 min rotating incubation at 4°C, the cells
were passed through a 40 μm cell strainer to remove
cell aggregates. Cells were then passed through an LS
column placed in a magnetic field of a MACS separator.
The cells that pass through (CD31-negative population)
were again passed through another LS column to get a
purer CD31-negative population. These cells were divided
into 3 fractions and grown in Neurobasal medium (NBM)
supplemented with B-27 (20 μl/ml) and Glutamax (10 μl/
ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), FGF and EGF (20
ng/ml each; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, PA, USA), DMEM
supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% L-glutamine (Gibco)
or endothelial medium (EM). The CD31-positive cells
which remained in the column were forcefully washed
out and cultured in collagen type I-coated dishes until
confluency and passaged once more before use. For
ZHE-483–2, CD45-positive cells were depleted using LD
columns (130–042-901, Miltenyi biotech), and then from
the CD45-negative population, CD31-positive cells were
isolated using the above procedure.

Reagents
Recombinant human TGF-β2 was purchased from
R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). All experiments
reported herein involving exogenous supplementation
were performed with human TGF-β2. Selected experiments
were confirmed using human TGF-β1 (data not shown).
SD-208 [14], a TGF-βRI kinase inhibitor was provided
by Scios (Fremont, CA, USA). Cediranib (AZD2171) was
purchased from Biovision (Milpitas, CA, USA).

Cell culture
Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells
(hCMEC/D3), kindly provided by P.C. Couraud (Paris,
France), human glioblastoma-derived endothelial cells
ZHE-459, ZHE-464 and ZHE-483–2 and human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in Lonza
EBM™-2 medium (CC-3156, Lonza, Walkersville, MD,
USA) with supplements (EGM-2-CC4176) that include
0.5 ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor
(hEGF, CC-4317A), 0.2 ml hydrocortisone (CC-4112A), 2
ml human fibroblast growth factor-B (hFGF, CC-4113A),
0.5 ml VEGF (CC-4114A), 0.5 ml recombinant longinsulin like growth factor (R3-IGF-1, CC-4115A), 0.5 ml
ascorbic acid (CC-4116A), 0.5 ml heparin (CC-4396A),
0.5 ml gentamicin sulphate amphotericin B (GA-1000,
CC-4381A), 10 ml (2%) fetal bovine serum (FBS, CC4101A) and 5 ml  (1  M) HEPES (Gibco, GrandIsland,
NY, USA) and 5 ml CD lipid concentrate (Gibco).
hCMEC/D3 were cultured from P30-P37 on Corning®
BioCoat™ collagen type I cellware (Corning) and used
for experiments. HUVEC, ZHE-459, ZHE-464 and ZHE483–2 cells were cultured from P2-P7 on the same dishes
as hCMEC/D3. All cells were grown in a humidified 37°C
incubator with 5% CO2. All starvation experiments for
endothelial cells were performed with plain Lonza EBM™2 medium without any supplements. LN-308, a longterm
adherent glioma cell line, was cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and 1% glutamine (Gibco). For all
experiments LN-308 cells were starved for 24 h in DMEM
containing 1% glutamine.

Real-time (RT) PCR
Total RNA was prepared with the NucleoSpin
System (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and cDNA
was transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase
(Bio-rad, Munich, Germany). For real-time PCR,
cDNA amplification was monitored using SYBR Green
chemistry on the 7300 Real time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Zug, Switzerland). The conditions for these
PCR reactions were: 40 cycles, 95°C/15 sec, 60°C/1 min,
using the primers specified in Supplementary Table 1.
Arf1 transcript levels were used as a reference for
relative quantification of mRNA expression levels using
the ΔCT method because they were observed to be stable
within each cell line under the experimental conditions
reported here.

Immunoblot
RIPA buffer (pH 7.8) consisting of 1% V/V NP-40,
5% sodium deoxycholate (0.5% V/V) (Sigma Aldrich,
Buchs, Switzerland), 1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.0 (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany), 5 M NaCl (Merck KGaA), 0.5 M
EDTA, pH 8.0 (Sigma) and MilliQ H2O was prepared,
sterile-filtered and stored at 4°C. Phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma), protease inhibitor cocktail sets III and
IV (Sigma), 200 mM sodium orthovanadate (pH 10)
and 0.5 M sodium fluoride were added freshly to the
RIPA buffer before lysing the cells. After this, protein
levels were determined using a Bradford-based protein
assay (Biorad). Denatured whole protein lysates (40 μg/
lane) were separated on 10–15% acrylamide gels. After
transfer to nitrocellulose (Biorad), blots were blocked
in TBST containing 5% skim milk and incubated
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Rabbit anti-

Isolation of human glioblastoma-derived
endothelial cells
The net weight of the glioma tissue was measured
followed by dissociation with 10 mg/ml collagenase/
dispase (11097113001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and rotation with gentleMACS C-tubes (130–093-237,
Miltenyi biotech, Cologne, Germany). Erythrocytes were
lysed by resuspending and incubating the cells in a 3:1
ratio of water:PBS. Cells were then counted and 20 μl
of FcR blocking reagent and 20 μl of CD31 microbeads

The membranes were then washed in TBST and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-coupled goat antirabbit (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or donkey
anti-goat (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) secondary
antibodies. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced
chemo luminescence (Pierce/Thermo Fisher, Madison,
WI, USA).

duplexes (S100049595, S100049602, S10049609) were
used along with a control non-targeting siRNA pool from
Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) with the same transfection
reagents and siRNA concentration as used for the silencing
of other receptors. Gene silencing was verified by qPCR
and immunoblot as indicated.

Angiogenesis-related in vitro assays
hCMEC were cultured in full medium with TGF-β
or SD-208 or both for 96 h before being detached using
accutase (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) and
transferred to growth factor-reduced matrigel (356230,
BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in 96 well
plates at 15,000 cells/50 μl. Tube formation was assessed
at 4, 12 and 24 h and photographs were taken using a Carl
Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 100, Göttingen, Germany).
Tube length (mm), number of tubes (n) and number of
branching points (n) were calculated as average of 3
images per condition from independent experiments using
the Adobe Acrobat X Pro (Adobe, Ireland).
For the sprouting assay, the conditions were same
as for tube formation except that 2, 000 cells/50 μl were
transferred to 96 well plates containing growth factorreduced matrigel and were left in the matrigel for 7 days.
Then the number of sprouts formed by the cells was
counted for 3 images per condition from independent
experiments using ImageJ 1.40g software (NIH).

ELISA
hCMEC or GMEC were seeded at 2.6 × 104 cells/
cm . Indicated treatments were performed in basal
medium without serum and supplements for indicated time
periods. Supernatants were harvested and cellular debris
was removed by centrifugation 1200 rpm for 10 min.
Supernatants were then concentrated by centrifugation at
4000 g for 30 min using the Amicon® Ultra 3K device
3,000 NMWL (Millipore). Protein concentrations in
supernatants were measured by BCA assay (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) and equal amounts of
protein were used for VEGF-A ELISA (BMS277/2TEN,
eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) and PlGF ELISA
(RAB0404, Sigma). Pure serum-free medium without
cells was used as a negative control for all ELISA.

hCMEC were cultured in full medium followed by
serum starvation for 24 h in normoxia or hypoxia. The cells
were then detached using accutase (PAA Laboratories),
stained with goat anti-VEGFR-1/Flt-1 (AF321, R&D
Systems), mouse anti-αvβ3 (clone LM609, MAB1976)
and mouse anti-αvβ5 (clone P1F6, MAB1961) (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) or appropriate isotype controls:
goat IgG, (sc-2028, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse
IgG2a ĸ (550339, BD Biosciences). After 2 washing
steps with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA), cells were incubated at 4°C with the following
secondary antibodies: anti-human alexa fluor 488
antibody (Invitrogen), anti-goat IgG-FITC (F2016, Sigma
Aldrich) or anti-mouse IgG1-PE (RMG1–1, Biolegend,
London, UK). For the detection of endoglin, mouse PE
anti-human CD105 antibody (323205, Biolegend) or the
isotype control PE mouse IgG1K (400113, Biolegend)
and for TβRIII, goat PE anti-human TβRIII (FAB242P,
R&D Systems) or the isotype control PE goat IgG
(403004, Biolegend) were used. Subsequently, the cells
were washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and
subjected to flow cytometric analysis. A Cyan® Dako flow
cytometer was used and data were analyzed via Summit®
software version 4.3 (Beckmann Coulter, Krefeld,
Germany). Signal intensity was calculated as the ratio of
the mean fluorescence of the specific antibody and the

RNA interference
To silence TβRII, ALK-1, ALK-5, endoglin
or SP1, hCMEC cells were transiently transfected
using Metafectene Pro transfection reagent (Biontex,
San Diego, CA, USA) and siRNA pools (100 nM),
containing four selected siRNA duplexes, each with a
modification pattern that eliminates off-target effects
caused by both strands (ON-TARGETplus, SMARTpool,

A SFI of 1.3 was arbitrarily defined as a significant surface
expression. For some analyses, cells were permeabilized
by Fix/Perm Buffer Set (Biolegend).
For analysis of cell death, cells were grown in
6-well plates and treated with TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 72 h.
Cells were then harvested, annexin (Anx) V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (1:100) and propidium iodide (PI; 50 μg/
ml) were added, and fluorescence in a total of 10,000
events (cells) per condition was recorded in the flow
cytometer. Annexin V- or PI-positive cells were counted
as dead cells, the remaining cells were designated
the surviving cell fraction. Loss of viability was also
confirmed by trypan blue dye exclusion [31].
