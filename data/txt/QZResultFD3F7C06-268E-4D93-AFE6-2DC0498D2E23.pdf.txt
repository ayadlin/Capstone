BACKGROUND: Previous results from an interim analysis of an open-label, randomized, phase 3 study demonstrated that bortezomib combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was superior to bortezomib monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
myeloma who had previously received one or more lines of therapy. Protocol-defined final survival data from that study are provided here.
METHODS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either bortezomib alone (1.3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of every
21-day cycle) or bortezomib-PLD (bortezomib plus PLD 30 mg/m2 intravenously on day 4). The primary endpoint was the time to
progression. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and the overall response rate.
RESULTS: In total, 646 patients (bortezomib-PLD, n 5 324; bortezomib alone, n 5 322) were randomized between December, 2004,
and March, 2006. On the clinical cutoff date (May 16, 2014) for the final survival analysis, at a median follow-up of 103 months, 79% of
patients had died (bortezomib-PLD group: 253 of 324 patients; 78%; bortezomib alone group: 257 of 322 patients; 80%). The median
OS in the bortezomib-PLD group was 33 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.9-37.1) versus 30.8 months (95% CI, 25.2-36.5) in
the bortezomib alone group (hazard ratio, 1.047; 95% CI, 0.879-1.246; P 5 .6068). Salvage therapies included conventional and novel
drugs, which were well balanced between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite inducing a superior time to progression,
long-term follow-up revealed that PLD-bortezomib did not improve OS compared with bortezomib alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The inability to sustain the early observed survival advantage may have been caused by the effects of
subsequent lines of therapy, and underscores the need for long-term follow-up of phase 3 trials while recognizing the challenge of

becomes refractory to further treatment. However, with
the advent of new and more effective drugs for the treatment of MM, both alone and in combination with established anti-MM agents, there is now a rapid increase in
the number of therapeutic options available to patients
with MM, particularly in the relapsed/refractory setting.
The combination of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is considered an important
therapeutic option for patients with relapsed or refractory
MM who have received 1 or more prior therapies. Initial
therapy with novel combinations that included bortezomib and/or PLD demonstrated high overall response rates
(which ranged from 80% to 100%), complete response
rates (range, 20%-30%), and very good partial response
rates (range, 30%-50%) in previously untreated patients
with MM.3-7
The results from the interim analysis of the study
demonstrated that the bortezomib-PLD combination significantly reduced the risk of developing disease progression by 45% and prolonged the median time to
progression (TTP) by 3 months in patients with relapsed
or refractory MM.8 An early overall survival (OS) benefit
from treatment with bortezomib-PLD was observed compared with bortezomib monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR],
1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.002-1.97; P 5
.0476).8 Here, we report results from the protocoldefined, long-term follow-up for survival analysis of the
study. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
National Clinical Trial NCT00103506.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Patients (aged 18 years) with confirmed MM whose disease had progressed after an initial response to at least 1
line of prior therapy or had been refractory to initial treatment were eligible. Patients who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, a life
expectancy of at least 3 months, platelets 75,000/mm3,
hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL, an absolute neutrophil count
1000/mm3, creatinine clearance 30 mL/minute, total
bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, and corrected serum calcium <12 mg/dL (3.0 mM/L) or ionized
calcium <6.5 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L) were enrolled in the
study. Patients were bortezomib-naive and were excluded
if they had previous disease progression while receiving
anthracycline-containing therapy. Additional exclusion
criteria included prior doxorubicin or other anthracycline
exposure >240 mg/m2, clinically significant cardiac disease, a left ventricular ejection fraction less than instituCancer

tional normal limits, and grade 2 or higher peripheral
neuropathy.
The study protocol was approved by local independent ethics committees, and the study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and in compliance with
the protocol. All participants provided written informed
consent to participate in the study.
Study Design and Treatment

This was a phase 3, open-label, randomized, activecontrolled, multicenter study. The eligible patients were
randomized (1:1) to receive either bortezomib monotherapy (1.3 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of
every 21-day cycle; n 5 322) or bortezomib-PLD combination therapy (the same bortezomib monotherapy with
PLD, 30 mg/m2 as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day
4 of each 21-day cycle; n 5 324) (Fig. 1). Before randomization, patients were stratified according to their serum
b2 microglobulin levels (2.5, >2.5 and 5.5, or >5.5
mg/L) and response to previous treatment (response followed by progression or primary refractory disease). Study
treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or up to 8 cycles.
Patients who were still responding after 8 cycles and had
acceptable tolerability to the drug continued the treatment. Crossover to combination therapy from monotherapy was disallowed. Details of the study, including results
from the interim analysis data, were published in 2007.8
The final survival analysis presented here was based on the
clinical cutoff date (May 16, 2014) upon final study
closure.
Endpoint

OS was defined as the interval from randomization to
death from any cause. Data were censored at the last date
the patient was known to be alive (for patients who were
not known to have died).
Statistical Method

Long-term follow-up survival data were collected until
approximately 80% of enrolled patients had died. The
distribution of OS was estimated for each treatment group
using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test, stratified by enrollment strata, was used to compare the 2 treatment groups. A stratified Cox proportional-hazards
model was used to estimate HRs (bortezomib monotherapy vs bortezomib-PLD: HR >1 indicates a treatment

effects of other prognostic factors were examined in a separate Cox proportional-hazards model. Subgroup analysis
was performed to obtain HR estimates in each subgroup
along with associated 95% CIs.

Subgroup Analysis

RESULTS

Subsequent Therapy

Patients and Treatments

Patients in both groups received salvage therapies (78% in
the bortezomib-PLD group vs 80% in the bortezomib
monotherapy group), which were well balanced (Table 1).
The most frequent salvage therapies (received by >10%
patients in any group) in the bortezomib-PLD group versus the bortezomib monotherapy group included dexamethasone (47% vs 51%), thalidomide (31% vs 31%),
cyclophosphamide (26% vs 31%), melphalan (24% vs
22%), lenalidomide (23% vs 21%), bortezomib (23% vs
18%), and doxorubicin (6% vs 11%). No tumor assessment data were collected after subsequent therapy.

Of 646 enrolled patients, 324 were randomized to the
bortezomib-PLD group and 322 were randomized to the
bortezomib monotherapy group. The baseline demographics and other characteristics were well balanced, and
the groups were similar in the number and type of prior
systemic therapy for MM.8
OS Analysis

At the clinical cutoff, 79% of patients had died (bortezomib-PLD, 253 patients [78%]; bortezomib, 257 patients
[80%]), 6% withdrew consent, 4% were lost to followup, and 11% were still alive (bortezomib-PLD, 37
patients [11%]; bortezomib, 34 patients [11%]). The median follow-up for survival was 103 months (8.6 years).
The median OS for patients in the bortezomib-PLD
group was 33.0 months (95% CI, 28.9-37.1 months) versus 30.8 months (95% CI, 25.2-36.5 months) for those in
the bortezomib monotherapy group (HR, 1.047; 95%
CI, 0.879-1.246; P 5 .6068). This 2-month difference in
median survival in favor of the bortezomib-PLD group
over the bortezomib monotherapy group was not statistically significant (Fig. 2).
2052

Subgroup analyses based on baseline variables were performed to evaluate their impact on the overall results. The
results from the survival analysis by subgroup were generally consistent with the overall results except among those
patients who had no response to initial treatments (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Results from this randomized, phase 3, final survival analysis report suggest a similar OS for the bortezomib-PLD
combination therapy versus bortezomib monotherapy after a long-term median follow-up of 8.6 years. At the clinical cutoff of May 16, 2014, for the current analysis, a
mortality rate of 79% was reported. This study represents
the first long-term follow-up report of this combination
regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. The
median OS for patients who received bortezomib-PLD
patients was 33.0 months compared with 30.8 months for
those who received bortezomib monotherapy.

On the basis of observations from in vitro studies of
synergistic activity between bortezomib and anthracyclines9 and phase 1 data,10 a phase 3 study compared
single-agent bortezomib with bortezomib plus PLD in
patients with relapsed/refractory MM.8 The results from
the study demonstrated that bortezomib-PLD was superior to bortezomib monotherapy in treating patients with
relapsed or refractory MM whose disease had failed 1 or
more lines of prior therapy. Both the TTP and the overall
response rate were in favor of the combination therapy
compared with monotherapy.8 Furthermore, an interim
analysis also demonstrated a trend toward an OS benefit
favoring bortezomib-PLD combination therapy.8 A secondary analysis of that phase 3 study demonstrated that
the therapeutic advantage of prolonged TTP attributed to
the PLD-bortezomib combination, compared with bortezomib as a single agent, was maintained regardless of exposure to immunomodulatory drug therapy in prior lines
of treatment.11 Bortezomib-PLD was also active in
patients whose disease was refractory to other antimyeloma agents11 and was safe and effective in patients with
renal compromise.12
However, despite the superiority in TTP and an early
trend in OS favoring the combination therapy in the interim analysis, the long-term follow-up results revealed
similar OS for bortezomib-PLD combination therapy and
bortezomib monotherapy. Results from a subgroup analysis are generally consistent with the overall finding, while

patients who were aged 65 years, who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, who had
cytogenetic abnormalities, or who were women appeared
to have outcomes in favor of the combination therapy.
The lack of any difference in the results from the
final OS analysis could be because the majority of patients
in this study received subsequent therapy. The advancements in treatment options for MM and the availability of
new therapies, such as immunomodulators (eg, lenalidomide), other proteasome inhibitors, etc, have led to longer
life expectancy for patients with MM. Indeed, the original
design assumed that median survival in the bortezomib
group would be only 20 months, which was exceeded by
50%, suggesting the benefits of novel agents. With an armamentarium of treatment options available, it would be
unlikely to observe a difference in survival between the
treatment groups in this study after prolonged follow-up.
Several studies demonstrating a survival advantage in
patients with myeloma have used the approach of continuing therapies until disease progression; whereas, in
this study, the median number of treatment cycles
received by patients was only 5 in both groups. Therefore,
in retrospect, it is perhaps overly optimistic to expect that
5 cycles of PLD given over approximately 3.5 months
would induce a sustained improvement in long-term OS.
Results from this update underscore a general need for the
long-term follow-up of phase 3 oncology trials and the
practical challenge of having adequate power for long2053

term survival as a primary endpoint if effective subsequent
therapies are available.
Regardless of the significant improvement in patient’s
overall outcomes with recent advances in treatment
options, MM remains incurable in the majority of patients,
prompting a continued search for additional therapeutic
options, including multidrug-combinations. A prospective
comparison of bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone
versus thalidomide-dexamethasone in patients who
relapsed after high-dose therapy plus autologous stem cell
transplantation demonstrated that the median TTP was
significantly longer with bortezomib-thalidomide2054

dexamethasone than with thalidomide-dexamethasone,
with a trend in favor of a survival benefit.13 This study
demonstrated that a triplet bortezomib-based combination
was superior to a 2-drug thalidomide-based regimen for
patients with relapsed MM in terms of significantly greater
response rate and longer TTP. Currently, other novel
agents are being evaluated in combination with bortezomib
in phase 3 trials with longer follow-up. Multiple other
bortezomib-based combinations have also been studied in
clinical trials, with steroids plus alkylators, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, heat-shock protein90, histone deacetylase inhibitors, pan-Bcl-2 family

inhibitors, and other classes of targeted inhibitors.14-16 If
promising results are confirmed with longer follow-up,
then these combinations can bring about a shift in the treatment paradigm, maximizing their synergism while minimizing toxicities.
In summary, the current results demonstrate that,
despite the superior TTP observed and the early trend in
favor of OS with the combination therapy, long-term follow-up revealed that treatment with the bortezomib-PLD
combination did not improve OS compared with bortezomib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. The inability to sustain the observed early
survival advantage may have been caused by the effects of
subsequent lines of therapy, and underscores the need for
long-term follow-up of phase 3 trials while recognizing
the challenge of having adequate power to detect differences in long-term OS.
