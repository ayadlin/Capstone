Abstract
101F6 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene harbored on
chromosome 3p21.3, a region with frequent and early allele
loss and genetic alterations in many human cancers. We
previously showed that enforced expression of wild-type
101F6 by adenoviral vector–mediated gene transfer significantly inhibited tumor cell growth in 3p21.3-deficient non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo. The
molecular mechanism of 101F6-mediated tumor suppression
is largely unknown. A computer-aided structural and functional model predicts the 101F6 protein to be a member of the
cytochrome b561 protein family that is involved in the
regeneration of the antioxidant ascorbate. 101F6 protein is
expressed in normal lung bronchial epithelial cells and
fibroblasts but is lost in most lung cancers. Treatment with
101F6 nanoparticle–mediated gene transfer in combination
with a subpharmacologic dose (200–500 Mmol/L) of ascorbate
synergistically and selectively inhibited lung cancer cell
growth in vitro. Systemic injection of 101F6 nanoparticles
plus the i.p. injection of ascorbate synergistically inhibited
both tumor formation and growth in human NSCLC H322
orthotopic lung cancer mouse models (P < 0.001). Furthermore, exogenous expression of 101F6 enhanced intracellular
uptake of ascorbate, leading to an accumulation of cytotoxic
H2O2 and a synergistic killing of tumor cells through caspaseindependent apoptotic and autophagic pathways. The antitumor synergism showed by the combination treatment with
systemic administration of 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate
on lung cancer offers an attractive therapeutic strategy for
future clinical trials in cancer prevention and treatment.

Introduction
101F6 is one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes identified
in the human chromosome 3p21.3 region where allele loss and
genomic alterations have been frequently found in lung cancer and
many other cancers (1–3). In lung and breast cancers, the frequent
and early loss of heterozygosity and the overlapping homozygous

deletions observed in the 3p21.3 region suggest that one or more
genes in this region may play a critical role in the molecular
pathogenesis of these cancers (1–4). The cloned cDNA of 101F6
(GenBank accession no. AF040704) is 1117 bp long and encodes a
protein consisting of 223 amino acid residues. We previously
showed that the forced expression of wild-type (wt) 101F6 by
adenoviral vector–mediated gene transfer significantly inhibited
tumor cell growth in 3p21.3-deficient non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo (1). However, the mechanism of
101F6-mediated tumor suppression remains unknown.
A computer-aided homologous structure analysis of the 101F6
protein predicted it to be a member of the di-heme cytochrome
b561 (Cyt b 561) protein family, as shown by a more than 90%
alignment of its consensus amino acid sequence within the
transmembrane domain of the Cyt b 561 (5, 6). The Cyt b 561 family
of proteins constitutes a class of intrinsic high-redox-potential
membrane proteins containing two heme molecules that are
involved in the regeneration and homeostasis of ascorbate
(ascorbic acid, vitamin C) and has been shown to play an
important role in a wide variety of physiologic processes, including
iron uptake, cell defense, nitrate reduction, and signal transduction
(5–8). Cyt b 561 has been identified in a large number of
phylogenetically distant species, and most species contain three
or four Cyt b 561 paralogous proteins. Cyt b 561 family proteins share
well-conserved structural features characterized by multiple
transmembrane helices, four histidine residues that may coordinate two heme molecules, and putative ascorbate and monodehydro-ascorbate substrate–binding sites. However, the protein
sequence similarities are very low, both within a single and among
the phylogenetically distant species (5–7). Three Cyt b 561 proteins
encoded by the human genome have been identified thus far: Cyt
b 561 (ProteinSeq ID: NP_001017916; gene locus: at chromosome
17q11) locates inside chromaffin granules and may be involved in
ascorbate regeneration. Cyt b 561-2 (NP_079119; at 2q31.1) presents
in the plasma membrane of duodenum cells and may function as a
ferric reductase. Cyt b 561-3 (NP_872386; at 1p13.3) may be a
‘‘ubiquitous’’ Cyt b 561, and its physiologic function is unknown
(6, 7). The finding of 101F6 (NP_008953; at 3p21.3) as a Cyt b 561
domain-containing protein may add a new member to the human
Cyt b 561 protein family and predict a potential biological function.
The homology with Cyt b 561 triggers us to study the interaction of
101F6 with ascorbate in cancer pathogenesis and tumor suppression.
Cyt b 561 family proteins probably evolved from a common
ancestral protein and may ubiquitously use ascorbate as a primary

antioxidant and are involved in ascorbate homeostasis and
antioxidative defense (7). Ascorbate, a well-known antioxidant,
has been used as a supplemental therapeutic agent for human
cancer prevention and therapy, although controversy surrounds
regarding its effectiveness in treating some cancers and in
improving patients’ well-being (6, 9–16). Recent evidence, however,
has shown that ascorbate at high concentrations (>1000 Amol/L) is
selectively toxic to cancer cells but not normal cells in vitro, and
preclinical and early clinical studies have also shown that highdose ascorbate, given by i.v. and p.o. routes, may inhibit tumor
growth in animal models and improve symptoms and prolong
survival in patients with advanced cancer (6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18). These
studies suggest that the role of high-dose ascorbate in cancer
treatment should be reevaluated. On the basis of the structural
association of 101F6 with the Cyt b 561 protein family and its potent
tumor-suppressing activity shown in vitro and in vivo, we
hypothesized that 101F6 may function as a novel class of Cyt
b 561 protein. Under normal physiologic conditions, 101F6 may be
activated in response to environmental oxidative stress to protect
cells from oxidative damage by regenerating ascorbate and
maintaining its homeostasis, a function that would be aberrant
in 101F6-deficient tumor cells. By contrast, restoration of 101F6
activity in 101F6-deficient tumor cells should facilitate ascorbatemediated cytotoxic H2O2 formation and suppress tumor cell
growth by inducing apoptosis.
To test these hypotheses, we examined endogenous expression of
101F6 protein in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, lung
fibroblasts, and NSCLC cell lines and tissue samples to assess its
role in lung cancer pathogenesis. Next, we investigated the
combined effects of 101F6 and ascorbate on normal lung cells
and 3p21.3-deficient NSCLC cells. Finally, we evaluated the
therapeutic efficacy of a combination of systemic injection of
101F6 nanoparticles and i.p. injection of ascorbate at a subpharmacologic dose in a human NSCLC H322 orthotopic lung
tumor mouse xenograft model to explore the translational
applications of this novel treatment strategy. We found that
101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate had a synergistic and selective
antitumor effect through unique caspase-independent apoptotic
and autophagic pathways in vitro and in vivo, setting the stage for
clinical application of this novel approach.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. Normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE)
cells, WI-38 lung fibroblasts and NSCLC cell lines A549, H1299, and H322
with varied 3p21.3 and p53 expression status were used for both in vitro and
in vivo experiments. The A549 cell line was maintained in F12 nutrient
mixture supplemented with 10% FCS. The H1299 and H322 cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 5% glutamine.
WI-38 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with
10% FCS and 5% glutamine. Normal HBE cells were cultured in keratinocyte
serum-free medium containing epidermal growth factor and bovine
pituitary extract.
Reagents and antibodies. Ascorbate (Cenolate) was purchased from the
pharmacy at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. DC
reagent (20 mmol/L) in D5W was produced in our laboratory, and
preparation of DC:plasmid-DNA nanoparticles were described previously
(19, 20). Mouse, rabbit, and goat polyclonal antibodies were purchased from
various commercial sources: anti-101F6 and FITC-conjugated anti-101F6
(Bethyl Laboratories); anti-Myc and anti–h-actin (A1978; Sigma); anti–
caspase-2 and antiapoptosis-inducing factor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
anti–caspase-3, anti–caspase-6, anti–caspase-7, and anti–caspase-9 (Cell
Signaling Technology), and anti–caspase-8 (BD Biosciences). Anti–microtu-

bule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 antibody was kindly provided by
Dr. Seiji Kondo.
Immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was done in cells cultured in chamber slides. Briefly,
48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin and then
incubated with 5.0 Ag/mL FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-101F6 antibodies
in 5% PBS-bovine serum albumin buffer for 1 h at room temperature.
Subsequently, the stained samples were mounted with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI)–containing Vectashield solution (Vector Laboratories Inc.) to counterstain the nuclei. The slides were then examined under
a fluorescence microscope equipped with ImagePro image analysis software
(Media Cybermetrics) to determine the subcellular localization of 101F6
protein. Expression of the 101F6 protein in cell lines was analyzed by
immunocytochemical staining with anti-101F6 rabbit polyclonal antibodies
and the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.). The 10%
formalin-fixed cell lines and the paraffin-embedded tissue sections were
incubated with anti-101F6 antibodies (2.5 Ag/mL in PBS), and immunostaining was done with the Vectastain kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Subsequently, the samples were counterstained with Harries
hematoxylin and examined under a microscope equipped with a digital
camera.
Tumor cell-induced clonogenicity assay. To analyze the effect of 101F6
protein expression on tumor cell–induced clonogenicity in vitro, we
transfected H1299 cells (2  105 cells) on six-well plates with 101F6- or
Myc-101F6–expressing vector or with empty vector using the DC reagent.
H1299 cells were transfected with 2 Ag of each test plasmid DNA together
with 1 Ag of neomycin resistance gene containing the pcDNA3.1 vector
(Invitrogen). The vectors (1 Ag) alone and with the wt p53 plasmid were used
as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 24 h, cells were
harvested, stained with trypan blue, and counted. Cells (1  104) were
replated onto a 100-mm dish in triplicate and grown in 10% FCS and RPMI
1640 containing 400 Ag/mL of G418 for 2 weeks. The numbers of G418resistant colonies were counted after staining with crystal violet.
Cell viability assay. Cells counts were done to determine IC50 and IC20
values of ascorbate in NSCLC cell lines, WI-38 cells, and HBE cells. For this,
2  105 cells were plated and precultured for 24 h in six-well plates and then
incubated in the presence of 10 different concentrations of ascorbate for
72 h. The IC50 and IC20 values of ascorbate were calculated using a curvefitting system as described previously (21). Inhibition of tumor cell growth
by 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate was also analyzed by cell counts.
Cells were seeded as above and 24 h later were transfected with 3 Ag of
101F6 or LacZ nanoparticles in serum-free medium for 2 h. Cell media were
replenished with or without various concentrations of ascorbate. Cells were
harvested 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment, and cell viability was determined
by trypan blue exclusion assay.
Analysis of apoptosis induction in vitro. Induction of cell death in
tumor cells transfected with the 101F6 nanoparticles with or without
ascorbate at an IC20 level was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) using the Apo-BrdU kit (BD Biosciences PharMingen) and
the FITC-labeled annexin V apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences
PharMingen). Briefly, cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of
4  105 cells per dish and transfected the following day with 6 Ag of LacZ
vector or 101F6-expressing vector with or without ascorbate at an IC20 level.
After 72 h, cells were harvested and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. After
incorporation of BrdUTP, cells were visualized using FITC-labeled antibromodeoxyuridine antibody. The amount of total cellular DNA was
determined by staining cells with propidium iodide (PI)/RNase buffer. Cells
were then processed for FACS analysis to determine the degree of apoptosis
and cell cycle kinetics, as described previously (20). For the annexin V
analysis, cells were collected 24 h after transfection and then resuspended at
a density of 1  106 cells/mL in 1 binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES buffer
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1.8 mmol/L
CaCl2] and stained simultaneously with FITC-labeled annexin V (25 ng/mL;
green fluorescence) and PI (50 ng/mL). PI was provided as a 50 Ag/mL stock
solution (BD Biosciences PharMingen) and was used as a cell viability
marker. Cells were analyzed using FACS, and the data were analyzed with
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Synergistic Inhibition of NSCLC by 101F6 and Ascorbate
Measurement of intracellular uptake of ascorbate. Cells (1  107)
were treated and then incubated with ascorbate for 2 h, washed thrice with
PBS, and then collected. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5% formic acid
and centrifuged at 500  g for 5 min. The supernatant was analyzed with
the Agilent 1200 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/
MS; refs. 22, 23). The HPLC analytic column used was a PrimesPhere (5-Am
C18 HC 250  2.00 mm; Phenomenex). The precolumn was a 0.5-Am
replacement frit from Upchurch Scientific Inc. (Oak Harbor, WA). The
mobile phase was a gradient over 10 min with 0.2% formic acid in water and
methanol mixtures. The flow rate was 300 AL/min, and the column was
maintained at 25jC. Ascorbate’s retention time was 2.08 min. The
concentrations of the standard solution of ascorbate were in the 5.0–
1,000.0 ng/mL range; the ascorbate was dissolved in a mixture of methanol
and 0.2% formic acid (50:50).
Determination of intracellular H2O2 production. Intracellular H2O2
production was measured using H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes), a cellpermeable H2O2-sensitive fluorescent dye indicator. The cell-permeable
H2DCFDA is not fluorescent, and once it is in the cytosol, the esterase
activity renders the indicator impermeable by forming the fluorescent
product dichlorofluorescein. The fluorescence intensity of the dye is
proportional to the rate of oxidation by reactive oxygen species
(predominantly H2O2) generated by agents with a high redox potential,
such as ascorbate. Briefly, cells (3  105) were treated with various
experimental agents and then incubated with or without ascorbate for 72 h.
H2DCFDA (0.5 Amol/L) was added to the cell cultures during the last 30 min
of incubation in the dark. Cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in PBS
buffer, and analyzed by FACS.
Caspase inhibition assay. To determine whether caspase is involved in
the effects of exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate, a caspase inhibition assay was
done with a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (R&D Systems, Inc.) dissolved
in DMSO according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ad-CMV-p53 was
used as a positive control. Briefly, H1299 cells (3  106 cells per well) were
seeded in a 60-mm dish and incubated overnight. Next, 50 or 100 Amol/L
Z-VAD-fmk was added 2 h before treatment with 101F6 nanoparticles and
ascorbate or recombinant adenoviral infection with Ad-p53 at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 50. After 24 h, cell viability was determined by trypan
blue staining, as described above. The viability of untreated H1299 cells in
the presence of diluted DMSO was regarded as 100%.
Characterization and quantification of autophagy. To quantify acidic
vesicular organelles (AVO) in cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and
ascorbate, we did vital staining with an acridine orange fluorescent dye
according to the protocol described elsewhere (24–26). Briefly, treated
tumor cells were stained with acridine orange, which was added at a final
concentration of 1 Ag/mL for 15 min. To quantify the AVOs that developed,
cells were detached by trypsinization and collected for FACS analysis.
The green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged LC3-expressing cells were
used to show the induction of autophagy (24–26). GFP-LC3 cells showed a
diffuse distribution under control conditions, but showed a pundit pattern
(GFP-LC3 dots) and increased in both number and fluorescence intensity in
the presence of autophagy. Therefore, we determined the involvement of
LC3 in tumor cells treated with exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate using the
GFP-LC3 expression vector. H1299 cells were transfected with the GFP-LC3
expression vector using the DC reagent. After an overnight culture, cells
were treated according to the protocol cited above, and then 24 h after
treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and examined under
a Nikon TC200 fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera and
imaging analysis software.
An autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was used to
verify whether the 101F6 and ascorbate-induced autophagy in these NSCLC
cells was a death-promoting or protective process. H1299 and H322 cells
were treated with 101F6 nanoparticle and ascorbate at an IC20 level alone or
in combination in the presence and absence of 5 mmol/L of 3-MA. Fortyeight hours after treatment, cell viability was determined as described in
Cell Viability Assay.
Animal studies. All animals were maintained, and animal experiments
were done in accordance with NIH and institutional guidelines established

www.aacrjournals.org

for the Animal Core Facility at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. The animals used in this study were female nu/nu mice
(4–6 weeks old) that were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
Before tumor cell inoculation, mice were subjected to 3.5 Gy of total body
irradiation from a cesium-137 radiation source. To evaluate the therapeutic
efficacy of the systemic injection of 101F6 nanoparticles and i.p. injection of
ascorbate in a human H322 orthotopic lung cancer mouse model, mice
were inoculated with H322 cells (2  106 cells per mouse) in 100 AL of PBS
by intrathoracic injection using a 27-gauge needle. The tumor cell–
inoculated mice were randomly divided into six treatment groups (six mice
per group): group A was treated with PBS; group B with ascorbate; group C
with LacZ nanoparticles; group D with LacZ nanoparticles and ascorbate;
group E with 101F6 nanoparticles; and group F with 101F6 nanoparticles
and ascorbate. On days 6, 9, and 12 after tumor cell inoculation, we
administered LacZ or 101F6 nanopartcles i.v. via the tail veins at a
concentration of 25 Ag of plasmid and 10 nmol of DC each in 100 AL of D5W
per mouse. In groups B, D, and F, ascorbate was injected i.p. thrice, each at a
dose of 250 mg/kg of body weight, together with the nanoparticles in
groups D and F. On day 28 after tumor cell inoculation, all mice were killed,
and the total weight of the pleural tumors in each mouse was measured.
In addition, to estimate 101F6 protein expression and apoptosis in
tumors, on day 26, two mice from each group were repeatedly treated with
the respective agents for that group (101F6 nanoparticles were replaced by
Myc-tagged 101F6 nanoparticles for immunohistochemical analysis). After
48 h (on day 28), these mice were killed, and pleural tumors larger than
5 mm in diameter were randomly harvested and freshly frozen. 101F6
protein expression was then analyzed by anti-Myc antibody (1:100) using
the Vectastain Elite ABC kit and examined under a microscope. Induction of
apoptosis was analyzed using an in situ cell death detection kit with
fluorescein (Roche Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues were then examined under a fluorescence microscope and
analyzed using the equipped software.
Statistical analysis. All in vitro experiments were done at least thrice
with duplicate or triplicate samples. ANOVA and Fisher’s tests were used to
compare the values for the test and control samples, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. StatView 5.0 (Abacus Concepts, Inc.),
and SAS software were used for all of the statistical analyses. To analyze the
interaction between 101F6 and ascorbate, we assumed that treatment with
ascorbate would multiply the number of cells by a certain amount (p1) and
that treatment with 101F6 would multiply the number of cells by another
amount (p2). If there were no interaction, the combination of ascorbate and
101F6 should multiply the cell count by p1  p2. For example, if ascorbate
multiplies the count by 0.80 and 101F6 multiplies it by 0.70, then, in
the absence of an interaction, the combined treatments should multiply the
count by 0.8  0.7 = 0.56. Because we assumed a multiplicative effect, the
log of the cell count was taken as the dependent variable to allow the use of
a linear model. To account for the fact that the data were paired (i.e., if there
is a different baseline for each experiment), the experiment was modeled as
a random effect. Thus, we fit a linear model with the log of the cell count as
the dependent variable, the experiment as a random effect, and the actions
of ascorbate, 101F6, and the two combined as fixed effects. The estimation
was made with the restricted maximum likelihood method using JMP
software from SAS. The significance of the interaction was evaluated by a
paired t test.

Results
Expression and tumor-suppressing activity of 101F6 protein.
To determine the expression and subcellular localization of
exogenous 101F6, we did immunocytochemical (Fig. 1A) and
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1B) staining assays in 101F6-negative
human NSCLC H1299 cells transiently transfected with the 101F6expressing plasmid vectors complexed with N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate:cholesterol
(DC) nanoparticles (101F6 nanoparticles). Expression of 101F6
showed a typical subcellular localization on the cytoplasm and

organelle or vesicular (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) membrane. No
endogenous 101F6 protein expression was detected in H1299 cells.
In addition, no 101F6 was detected in H1299 cells transfected with
the empty vector. On the other hand, 101F6 was clearly detected in
the cytoplasm of H1299 cells transfected with 101F6-expressing
plasmid vector. We also checked endogenous 101F6 protein
expression in 101F6-negative human NSCLC A549, H322, and

H460 cells; HBE and lung fibroblast WI-38 cells. Endogenous 101F6
protein expressions could not be detected in the A549, H322, and
H460 cells but was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of normal
HBE and WI-38 cells. We also analyzed endogenous 101F6
expression in a panel of 19 lung cancer cell lines and in normal
HBE and WI-38 cells by Western blot, using ectopically expressed
101F6 protein in H1299 cell as a positive control (Fig. 1C). A low
and moderate level of 101F6 protein expression was detected in
normal HBE and WI-38 cells, respectively, consisting with the
above immunofluorescence imaging analysis. No expression of
101F6 protein was detected in most (f90%) of these NSCLC cells,
and a low level of expression was detected in two cell lines H69 and
H128, suggesting that the inactivation of 101F6 may be predepository for tumorigenesis.
Clonogenic assays in soft agar confirmed the tumor-suppressing
activity of exogenously expressed 101F6 in vitro (Fig. 1D and E).
Tumor cell-induced clonogenicity was significantly inhibited in
101F6- and Myc-101F6–expressing H1299 cells compared with
vector control cells (P < 0.0001), and this tumor-suppressing
function was significant but not as great as exogenously expressed
p53 that was used as a positive control. These results show that the
restoration of 101F6 protein function in 3p21.3-deficient NSCLC
cells efficiently suppresses tumor cell-induced clonogenicity.
Synergistic and selective inhibition of 3p21.3-deficient
NSCLC cell growth by 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate
in vitro. To determine the role of 101F6 as a potential member of
the Cyt b 561 protein family in ascorbate-associated biological
activities, we first analyzed the effect of forced expression of 101F6
protein on cell growth in various normal lung and NSCLC cells by
101F6 nanoparticle–mediated gene transfer in the presence and
absence of ascorbate at varied doses. We determined the IC50 value
for ascorbic acid in two NSCLC cell lines, H1299 and H322, and two
normal cell lines, HBE and lung fibroblast WI-38. There was about
a 250- to 500-fold difference in the IC50 value between normal and
cancer cell lines (IC50 values of ascorbate for NSCLC H322 and
H1299 were 0.54 and 1.17 mmol/L and for normal HBE and WI-38
cells were 252 and 150.2 mmol/L, respectively). To evaluate the
combined effects of exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate on cell growth,
we determined the viability of cells transfected with 101F6
nanoparticles and treated with ascorbate at a subpharmacologic
concentration (IC20; Fig. 2A). Untransfected or LacZ nanoparticle–
transfected cells were used as negative controls. A significant
reduction (70–80%) in cell viability was seen in H1299 and H322

Figure 1. Expression and tumor-suppressing activity of 101F6 protein.
A, exogenous and endogenous expression of 101F6 protein in normal lung and
NSCLC cells by immunostaining. Immunocytochemical staining was done in
untransfected cells (H1299 ), empty vector-transfected H1299 cells (H1299 +
EV ), 101F6 -transfected H1299 cells (H1299 + 101F6 ), untransfected NSCLC
cells (A549), normal HBE, and normal lung fibroblasts (WI-38 ). B, subcellular

with DAPI (blue ). C, Western blot analysis of endogenous 101F6 protein
expression in human lung cancer cell lines and normal HBE and lung fibroblast
cells. The ectopically expressed 101F6 protein by plasmid vector-mediated gene

ascorbate on the growth of human lung
cancer and normal cells. A, effect of
exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate on the
growth of NSCLC H1299 and H322 cells,
normal HBE cells, and normal WI-38
fibroblasts. Cells were seeded on six-well
plates and transfected with 101F6
nanoparticles (101F6 ) or ascorbate (AA,
ascorbic acid) at an IC20 level alone or in
combination (101F6 + AA ). Cells not
treated (PBS ) or treated with LacZ vector
or DOTAP:Cholesterol (DC ), each alone or
in combination with AA at an IC20 level
(LacZ + AA and DC + AA ), were used as
controls. After 72 h, the viability of cells was
determined by cell counts. Cell viability was
expressed as the percentage of treated
cells relative to untreated cells. Bars, SD in

level compared with those in cells treated with ascorbate at an IC20
level in combination with DC (40%) or LacZ nanoparticles (50%),
or in cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles alone (30–40%
reduction). Furthermore, statistical analysis of the interaction
between two therapeutic agents indicated that combination
treatment with 101F6 nanoparticles and an IC20 dose of ascorbate
were synergistic in tumor cell growth inhibition (P < 0.0001). By
comparison, transfection with the 101F6 nanoparticles alone or in
combination with an IC20 dose of ascorbate had no effect on the
growth of normal HBE or WI-38 cells. These results suggest that the
inhibitory effects mediated by the agents alone or in combination
are highly tumor selective.

expressed 101F6 protein and an IC20 dose of ascorbate to induce
apoptosis in H1299 and H322 cells by FACS analysis using annexin

quantified by FACS with an annexin V assay in H1299 cells 24 h after
treatment with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate. In cells treated
with either 101F6 nanoparticles or ascorbate at an IC20 level alone,
12% and 14% of cells, respectively, were positive for annexin V
staining, compared with the basal levels of staining in control cells
treated with PBS (10%) or DC nanoparticles alone (12%). In cells
treated with DC and LacZ nanoparticles and ascorbate at an IC20
level, 25% and 25% of cells, respectively, were positive for annexin V
staining, whereas 83% of cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and
ascorbate stained positively for annexin V. Similar results were
obtained for H322 cells (data not shown). The induction of
apoptosis was determined by FACS with a FITC-dUTP–labeled
TUNEL reaction and PI staining in H1299 and H322 cells. In cells
treated with 101F6 nanoparticles or ascorbate alone, no apoptosis
was induced. Of the cells treated with LacZ nanoparticles and
ascorbate at an IC20 level, only 12% of H1299 and 3% of H322 cells
showed apoptosis (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the apoptotic populations
in cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate at an IC20
level were dramatically increased with f10-fold higher induction

than in untreated cells (PBS) or cells treated with LacZ nanoparticles and ascorbate. Treatment with 101F6 nanoparticles and
ascorbate dramatically enhanced the induction of apoptosis and
was synergistic in both cell lines (P < 0.0001) compared with either
agent alone or combination controls. These results suggest that the
observed synergistic inhibition of NSCLC cell growth may be
mediated through the induction of apoptosis promoted by the
mutual activities of exogenous 101F6 expression and ascorbate
treatment.
Enhanced intracellular uptake of ascorbate by exogenous
101F6 expression. To elucidate the mechanism of the induction of
tumor cell killing by 101F6 and ascorbate, we examined the effect of
exogenous expression of 101F6 protein on ascorbate-mediated
cytotoxic H2O2 formation and accumulation in NSCLC cells. We first
measured the intracellular uptake of supplemental ascorbate in
H1299 and H322 cells by a quantitative HPLC-LC/MS/MS analysis
2 h after transfection with 101F6 nanoparticles (refs. 22, 23; Fig. 3A
and B). Exogenous expression of 101F6 protein significantly
enhanced the intracellular uptake of extracellularly supplied
ascorbate, as shown by a more than 50% greater intracellular

ascorbate concentration in both H1299 (P < 0.0011) and H322 (P <
0.0003) cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate than
in cells treated with DC reagent and ascorbate or with LacZ
nanoparticles and ascorbate. Interestingly, exogenous expression
of 101F6 also seemed to increase intracellular accumulation of
intrinsic ascorbate, suggesting that 101F6 may function as a typical
Cyt b 561 in facilitating ascorbate regeneration and maintenance.
Enhanced intracellular H2O2 accumulation by 101F6 and
ascorbate. Next, we analyzed the effect of exogenous expression of
101F6 protein on ascorbate-mediated H2O2 formation and
accumulation in NSCLC cells using a fluorescent dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) assay and quantified by flow
cytometry (Fig. 3C and D). The oxidation of H2DCFDA in H1299
cells treated with 100 Amol/L H2O2 for 1 h served as a positive
assay control. No increase in the level of intracellular H2O2 was
seen in either H1299 cells treated with ascorbate at an IC20 level or
with LacZ- or 101F6-expressing vector alone. In contrast, a
significant increase in the H2O2 level was observed in response
to 101F6 nanoparticle and ascorbate at an IC20 level (P < 0.0033).
Similar results were also obtained in H322 cells. A significant

Synergistic Inhibition of NSCLC by 101F6 and Ascorbate

increase in the intracellular accumulation of H2O2 was detected in
both cell lines only in response to exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate.
Taken together, our results showed that exogenous 101F6
promoted the intracellular uptake of ascorbate, which subsequently facilitated the formation and accumulation of cytotoxic H2O2
mediated by bioactivity of the ascorbate inside tumor cells and,
thus, accelerated tumor cell killing.
Caspase-independent cell death mediated by activities of
101F6 and ascorbate. To identify which cell death pathway is
responsible for mediating the effect of exogenous 101F6 and
ascorbate, we did Western blotting to analyze the activity of
caspases, a family of proteases that are involved in the signal
transduction of apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 4A). For this purpose, H1299
cells were transfected with 101F6 nanoparticles alone or with an
IC20 level of ascorbate. Untreated (PBS), DC, and LacZ vectortreated cells served as negative controls. Cells treated with
cisplatin, a well-known apoptosis-inducing and caspase-activating
anticancer drug, were used as a positive control, and the predicted
cleavage bands (p17, p19) of procaspase-3 were clearly detected on
the blot. In contrast, no activated caspase-3 was found in the H1299
cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate alone or in
combination, as shown by the lack of cleavage products of
precaspase-3 protein on the Western blot. No activation of caspase2, caspase-6, caspase-7, or caspase-9 was detected in response to
this treatment (data not shown). We also did a caspase activity
assay with and without caspase-specific inhibitors to further verify
the involvement of caspases in 101F6 and ascorbate-mediated
apoptosis induction (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 5B, the proportions
of viable H1299 cells transduced with a recombinant adenoviral
vector Ad-p53 at a MOI of 50 significantly increased from 17% to
24% (P < 0.012) in the presence of 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, and from 17% to 39% (P < 0.001) in the presence
of 100 Amol/L Z-VAD-fmk. On the other hand, addition of 50 or
100 Amol/L Z-VAD-fmk did not significantly affect the viability of
H1299 cells treated with exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate. Because
these high concentrations of Z-VAD-fmk inhibitor efficiently
suppress caspase activities in most cellular systems, these results
confirmed that the cell death induced by 101F6 and ascorbate is
independent of caspase activation.
101F6 and ascorbate-mediated tumor cell killing by
induction of autophagy. To identify the molecular pathway
leading to this caspase-independent cell death, we analyzed
whether autophagy, which is often seen in caspase-independent
cell death, might be induced. Autophagy is the process of
sequestering cytoplasmic proteins in the lytic compartment and
is characterized by the development of AVOs (27). We first
quantified AVO development by FACS using vital staining with an
acridine orange fluorescence dye (Fig. 5A). The percentage of AVOpositive cells showing prominent red fluorescence dramatically
increased 4–5-fold from 8% in cells treated with ascorbate at an
IC20 level that was determined in tumor cells or 101F6 nanoparticles alone to 38% in cells treated with both. These results
indicate that nanoparticle-mediated wt 101F6 gene transfer and an
IC20 dose of ascorbate induced the development of AVOs in H1299
cells, suggesting that autophagy had occurred.
To further characterize the autophagy induced by 101F6 and
ascorbate, we analyzed the expression status of the microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) proteins in H1299 cells. LC3
is a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p and specifically
associated with the autophagosome membrane (25, 27–29). We
used a novel GFP-tagged LC3 expression vector (GFP-LC3; refs. 25,

www.aacrjournals.org

27–29) to specifically detect and quantify the autophagy induced by
exogenous 101F6 and ascorbate in tumor cells by fluorescence
imaging analysis (Fig. 5B and C). When autophagy is induced, the
extensive formation of GFP-LC3–labeled structures (GFP-LC3
dots), which are pre-autophagosomes and autophagosomes, are
detected. Formation of GFP-LC3 dots were detected in H1299 cells
treated by 101F6 nanoparticles or ascorbate alone or in
combination, but no GFP-LC3 dot formation was observed in
untreated (PBS) or LacZ vector-treated controls. The percentage of
autophagic cells was determined by counting and averaging the
number of cells containing GFP-LC3 dots in at least five view fields
for each treatment under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 5C). The
populations of GFP-LC3–positive cells were significantly greater in
cells treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate than in cells
treated with either agent alone. These results collectively suggest
that treatment with exogenous 101F6 and an IC20 dose of ascorbate
specifically and efficiently induces autophagy.
There are mainly two types of autophagic effects observed in
cancer therapy. One is the apoptosis and cell death–inducing
autophagy and the other is a protective one (27). To verify whether
the 101F6- and ascorbate-induced autophagy in these NSCLC cells
was a cell death–promoting or protective process, we analyzed the
effect of the autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-MA on 101F6- and
ascorbate-induced cell death. 3-MA was shown to act specifically
upon the autophagic/lysosomal pathway of endogenous protein
degradation (30). In the presence of 3-MA, an increased cell
viability was observed in both H1299 and H322 cells treated with
101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate at an IC20 level alone or in

activity. A, effect of 101F6 and ascorbate on activity of caspase-3 by Western
blot analysis. H1299 cells were transfected with 101F6 nanoparticles with or
without ascorbate at an IC20 level. The treatments were same as in Fig. 2. Cells
treated with 50 Amol/L cisplatin for 72 h were used as a positive control (PC ).
After 72 h, the cells were lysed, and the supernatant was collected. The
activation of caspase-3 is indicated by the cleaved bands (p19 and p17 ) from
procaspase-3 (p35 ) on the blot. B, effect of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk

and AA or infection with Ad-p53 (50 MOI). The viability of untreated H1299 cells
in the presence of diluted DMSO was regarded as 100%. Bars, SD in three

combination compared with that in the absence of 3-MA (Fig. 5D),
indicating that the 101F6- and ascorbate-induced autophagy
mainly attribute to cell death. The autophagic cell death possessed
about 30–40% of the total tumor cell killing induced by either agent
alone or in combination (Fig. 5D), suggesting an important role of
autophagy in 101F6- and ascorbate-mediated tumor cell growth
inhibition.

Inhibition of tumor formation and growth by systemic
treatment with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate in orthotopic lung cancer mouse models. We next evaluated the
therapeutic efficacy of systemic (i.v.) administration of 101F6
nanoparticles and i.p. injections of ascorbate in a human H322
orthotopic lung cancer mouse model (Fig. 6A and B). The effect of a
combination of 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate was compared
with that of PBS, PBS and ascorbate, LacZ nanoparticles, LacZ
nanoparticles and ascorbate, and 101F6 nanoparticles alone. Each
treatment group consisted of six mice, and the in vivo experiment
was done twice. After 7 days of tumor-cell inoculation, animals were
given i.v. injections of nanoparticles every 2 days thrice at a dose of
25 Ag of plasmid DNA and 10 nmol of DC in 100 AL of 5% dextrose in
water (D5W) per mouse. For the combination treatment groups,
ascorbate was injected i.p. at 250 mg/kg of body weight together
with nanoparticles. Fourteen days after the last treatment, all mice
were killed, and the total weight of the pleural tumors and the body
weight of each mouse were recorded. There were fewer and smaller
tumors in mice treated with PBS and ascorbate, LacZ and
ascorbate, and 101F6 alone or with ascorbate than in those treated
with either PBS or LacZ alone. In particular, mice treated with
101F6 and ascorbate had no large tumors and had only a few small
tumors in the thoracic cavity. The mice treated with 101F6 and
ascorbate also had almost no pleural micrometastases (smaller
than 0.5 mm). The total tumor weight in mice treated with 101F6
and ascorbate was significantly less in any other treatment group
(P < 0.005). A statistical analysis of changes in total tumor weights
among treatment groups using a mathematical model developed
previously (21) showed that 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate
were synergistic (P < 0.0002) in this orthotopic model.
Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of 101F6 protein by
immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6C) and the induction of
apoptosis with an in situ cell death detection kit with a TUNEL
reaction (Fig. 6D and E) in tumors from each treatment group.
Animals were killed 48 h after treatment, and freshly frozen tumor
tissue samples were prepared for these assays. Exogenous
expression of 101F6 protein was detected in tumor cells from the
mice treated with 101F6 alone or with ascorbate but not in those
from other groups. Furthermore, a marked induction of apoptosis
was detected in tumors cells from animals treated with ascorbate,
101F6, or both. The intensity of staining of apoptotic cells was
much stronger for animals treated with 101F6 and ascorbate than
for animals treated with ascorbate or 101F6 alone. Few apoptosispositive cells were observed in tumors from animals treated with
PBS or LacZ. Apoptosis induction was significantly greater in
tumor cells in mice treated with 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate
than in mice treated with either agent alone (P < 0.0014; Fig. 6E).
These results indicated that the 101F6 nanoparticles were delivered
to the tumor sites by the systemic administration and expressed
and functioned successfully inside the tumor cells. The in vivo
mediation of tumor suppression by 101F6 and ascorbate is
consistent with that observed in vitro.

Discussion
We found that exogenous expression of 101F6 enhanced
intracellular uptake of supplemental ascorbate and thus facilitated
the ascorbate-mediated formation and accumulation of cytotoxic
H2O2 in tumor cells. We also found that the activation of 101F6
protein expression stimulated intracellular accumulation of
intrinsic ascorbate. These results suggest that 101F6 protein may

function as a novel class of Cyt b 561 protein in ascorbate
regeneration and homeostasis. More extensive biochemical studies
are needed to characterize the potential role of 101F6 protein as
a transmembrane electron transfer protein. In addition, we also
observed that both the exogenous and endogenous expression of
101F6 proteins in cell cultures were up-regulated by the addition of
ascorbate, although the exact mechanism was not clear (data not
shown). These mutually facilitated biological activities of 101F6
protein and ascorbate may partially contribute to their observed
synergism in selective inhibition of NSCLC cell growth and the
induction of apoptosis.
We have shown that tumor cell killing induced by 101F6 and
ascorbate is mediated through unique caspase-independent
apoptotic and autophagic pathways. Autophagy, a process
characterized by dynamic changes in the morphology of subcellular
membranes that lead to the degradation of cellular proteins and
cytoplasmic organelles, has recently been found to play an
important role in human cancer development and response to
chemotherapy and radiation therapy (27). It has also been shown
that tumor suppressors such as Beclin 1, DAP kinase, and PTEN

may mediate autophagy, and that deficiencies in or suppression of
autophagy might be associated with malignant transformation (31).
Autophagy has also been shown to be involved in multiple
physiologic processes in multicellular organisms, including protein
degradation and organelle turnover, and caspase-independent cell
death has been suggested to be a hallmark of autophagy (27, 31).
Tumor cells may undergo both apoptosis (programmed cell death
type I) and autophagy (programmed cell death type II) in response
to some anticancer drugs, and the two processes may occur
separately (32, 33) or simultaneously (34). In this study, we found
strong evidence that 101F6 and ascorbate induced autophagy, as
shown by a significant induction of AVO development and GFPLC3 dot formation on the autophagosome membrane. In addition,
we found that apoptosis and autophagy induced by 101F6 and
ascorbate did not occur synchronously, as indicated by the
evidence that autophagy was maximally induced 24 h after
treatment, whereas apoptosis induction reached a maximum of
72 h after treatment. This asynchronous occurrence of apoptosis
and autophagy may contribute to the synergistic antitumor effect
of 101F6 and ascorbate by efficiently activating multiple cell death

pathways at different times to achieve maximal killing of tumor
cells. Such caspase-independent cell death pathways are also
important in protecting the organism against unwanted and
potentially harmful cells when caspase-mediated routes fail (35, 36),
suggesting that this 101F6-induced cell death may be a defense
mechanism initiated in response to oxidative stress to remove
damaged cells and prevent tumorigenesis.
We also found that the cytotoxicity induced by the overexpression
of 101F6 protein and a high dose of ascorbate was highly selective
for tumor cells and had no effect on normal cell growth under the
same treatment conditions. This tumor-selective cytotoxicity has
been observed in ascorbate-mediated cancer treatment at a high
pharmacologic dose (>1,000 Amol/L) in vitro and in preclinical and
clinical trials in various human cancers (6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 37, 38). It
has been speculated that ascorbate-mediated cell death is due to
protein-dependent H2O2 generation via ascorbate radical formation,
with ascorbate as the electron donor (10). Our evidence of the
101F6-enhanced intracellular uptake of ascorbate and accumulation of H2O2 suggests that the 101F6 protein functions as the right
electron transfer protein in mediating this process. The resulting
H2O2 might target membrane lipids and form hydroperoxides or
reactive intermediates that are quenched or reduced in normal cells
but not in cancer cells and, in addition, the intracellular H2O2 could
target DNA and DNA repair proteins more efficiently in the tumor
cells because of the generally diminished superoxide dismutase
activity in cancer cells (8, 10, 37, 39).
Ascorbate has a controversial history as a cancer treatment, and
recent findings indicate that the route of ascorbate administration
may produce huge differences in plasma concentrations (6, 9, 10,
13, 17, 18, 37, 38). In particular, recent pharmacokinetic studies in
humans showed that 10 g of ascorbate given i.v. was estimated to
produce a plasma concentration of nearly 6 mmol/L, which was
more than 25-fold higher than the concentrations achieved by the
same oral dose (9, 17, 40). Other findings have shown as much as a
70-fold difference in the plasma concentration between p.o. and i.v.

administration, depending on the dose (10). It was for this reason
that we administered ascorbate i.p. rather than p.o. in our
preclinical study. Total doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg ascorbate were
administered i.p., and the 500 mg/kg dose was regarded as
the maximum tolerated dose in mice. The tumor-selective and
synergistic therapeutic efficacy of 101F6 nanoparticles and
ascorbate at a subpharmacologic dose may offer a safe and efficient
anticancer treatment strategy and improve cancer patient care.
In summary, we found that nanoparticle-mediated wt 101F6
gene transfer and a subpharmacologic concentration of ascorbate
synergistically and selectively inhibited NSCLC cell growth by
caspase-independent apoptosis and autophagy in vitro and in vivo.
These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanism
of tumor suppression by 101F6 and ascorbate and suggest that
combining 101F6 and ascorbate could be effective in overcoming
tumor resistance to therapeutic agents that depend on caspase
activation and may underline the potential utility of synergistic
induction of autophagy as a new cancer treatment modality. The
synergistic therapeutic efficacy shown by the systemic administration of 101F6 nanoparticles and ascorbate at a subpharmacologic
dose may offer an attractive strategy and rationale for future
clinical trials in the reevaluation of ascorbate-mediated cancer
prevention and treatment.
