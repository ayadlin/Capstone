Abstract
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive
malignant tumor that secretes various angiogenic factors. The
main inhibitor of plasminogen activators, PAI-1 (SERPINE1),
has been implicated in tumor progression and angiogenesis,
and high PAI-1 expression has been associated with poor
prognosis in MPM patients. In this study, we examined the
antiangiogenic effects of PAI-1 inhibition in MPM. We administered the PAI-1 inhibitor, SK-216, to orthotopic mouse models in which MPM cells expressing high levels of VEGF (VEGFA)
or bFGF (FGF2) were intrapleurally transplanted. SK-216
administration reduced tumor weights and the degree of angio-

genesis in intrapleural tumors, irrespective of their angiogenic
expression proﬁles. In addition, a combination of SK-216 and
the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin signiﬁcantly reduced
tumor weights compared with monotherapy, prolonging the
survival of animals compared with cisplatin treatment alone.
Furthermore, SK-216 inhibited migration and tube formation
of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced by
various angiogenic factors known to be secreted by MPM. These
ﬁndings suggest that PAI-1 inactivation by SK-216 may represent a general strategy for inhibiting angiogenesis, including for
the treatment of MPM. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3285–94. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

(9), several clinical trials (10, 11) have demonstrated that
bevacizumab fails to provide clinical beneﬁts in patients with
MPM. This inconsistent response to anti-VEGF therapy might be
due to the property of MPM cells to express various angiogenic
factors other than VEGF, such as basic FGF (bFGF; ref. 12),
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; ref. 13), and hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF; ref. 14). Given the clinical application of
antiangiogenic therapy for MPM, development of a strategy to
inhibit tumor angiogenesis irrespective of the primary angiogenic stimulus is necessary.
The plasminogen activation system, represented by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), the cellular receptor for
uPA (uPAR), and its speciﬁc inhibitor, plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1, PAI-1 (SERPINE1), plays a crucial role in tumor
progression and angiogenesis (15, 16). In particular, a large
number of animal and/or in vitro studies have revealed that
PAI-1 promotes tumor progression (17–19) and, in fact, a
signiﬁcant association between high expression of PAI-1 and
poor prognosis in various types of tumors, including MPM, has
been conﬁrmed (20–23). Several possible mechanisms have
been postulated to explain the linkage between PAI-1 and
tumor progression; among them, the involvement of PAI-1 in
tumor angiogenesis receives the most attention. Experiments
using PAI-1–deﬁcient (PAI-1/) mice have demonstrated the
signiﬁcance of host PAI-1 for tumor angiogenesis (24–26),
most likely through modulation of plasmin-mediated proteolysis (27), migration (28, 29), and apoptosis (30) of endothelial
cells. Recently, we demonstrated that inhibition of PAI-1 by a
speciﬁc inhibitor of PAI-1, SK-216, limited tumor angiogenesis
in vivo and migration and tube formation of human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced by VEGF in vitro (31).

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignant tumor, and its incidence is increasing worldwide (1–3).
Although a combination of therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, is performed, the prognosis of MPM
patients is very poor. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are
required to improve the prognosis of this disease.
Because angiogenesis is a critical factor for the progression of
solid tumors (4–6), inhibition of tumor angiogenesis represents
an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of malignancies. Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab, which targets VEGF, has been shown to improve survival in patients with
lung cancer (7) and colorectal cancer (8). Although a recent
French study reported that addition of bevacizumab to pemetrexed plus cisplatin improved survival in patients with MPM

Takayama et al.

These results prompted us to hypothesize that inhibition of
PAI-1 might regulate the occurrence of tumor angiogenesis
regardless of angiogenic stimuli.
Taking all of this into consideration, we decided to determine whether inhibition of PAI-1 by SK-216 could exert an
antitumor effect on MPM through antiangiogenic activity
regardless of the type of primary angiogenic factor. To this
end, we ﬁrst established orthotopic implantation mouse models of MPM using VEGF-high–expressing or bFGF-high–expressing MPM cells and examined the effect of systemic administration of SK-216 on tumor progression and angiogenesis. In
these models, we also assessed whether SK-216 affected the
therapeutic effect of cisplatin. Then, in vitro, we examined the
effects of SK-216 on proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs induced by angiogenic factors other than VEGF
that are known to be secreted by MPM.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
The human MPM cell line EHMES-10 was established from the
pleural effusion of a patient with MPM at Ehime University
(Matsuyama, Japan; refs. 32, 33), and MSTO-211H was purchased
from the ATCC. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640
medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100
U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). HUVECs authenticated
by Lifeline Cell Technology were purchased from Kurabo and
cultured following the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were
cultured at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed atmosphere. MSTO211H cells and HUVEC were used within 6 months after resuscitation. EHMES-10 cells were authenticated by short tandem
repeat analyses (Promega).
Reagents and animals
Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences. Recombinant
human bFGF (FGF2) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical,
and recombinant VEGF (VEGFA), PDGF-BB (PDGFB), and HGF
(HGF) were purchased from PeproTech. SK-216 (Supplementary
Fig. S1) was chemically synthesized and supplied by Shizuoka
Coffein Co., Ltd. Inhibitory activity of SK-216 on PAI-1 was
investigated using previously published methods (34), and the
IC50 was determined to be 44 mmol/L, as reported in international
patent WO04/010996. Bevacizumab (Avastin) was purchased from
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. AZD4547 was purchased from
Selleck Chemicals. Cisplatin was purchased from Nippon Kayaku.
Male SCID mice (6 weeks old) were obtained from CLEA Japan and
were maintained according to guidelines for the ethical use of
animals in research at Hiroshima University (Hiroshima, Japan).
Quantiﬁcation of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF protein
Concentrations of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF in culture supernatants and concentrations of VEGF and bFGF in the
lysates of intrapleural tumors were measured using an ELISA
Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems). Culture supernatants were prepared from EHMES-10
or MSTO-211H cells (2  105) seeded in 6-well plates and
cultured in 2 mL RPMI1640 with 10% FBS for 48 hours. Lysates
of intrapleural tumors were prepared as follows: intrapleural
tumors (approximately 50 mg each) consisting of EHMES-10
or MSTO-211H cells were homogenized in 1 mL lysis buffer
(Thermo Scientiﬁc Pierce) at 4 C for 2 minutes, centrifuged at

3286 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

10,000  g in 4 C for 5 minutes, and the supernatants were
collected.
Orthotopic implantation model
The cultured EHMES-10 cells or MSTO-211H cells were harvested, washed twice, and resuspended in PBS. Thereafter, 3  106
cells (EHMES-10) or 1  106 cells (MSTO-211H) in 100 mL PBS
were injected into the pleural cavity of SCID mice as described
previously (33). Mice were randomly assigned to a control group
and drug treatment group, each consisting of 6 or 7 animals.
SK-216 (100 or 500 ppm) was orally administered through drinking water at the same time as tumor cell inoculation. Bevacizumab
(3 or 10 mg/mouse) was given by intraperitoneal injection on days
7, 10, 14, and 17. AZD4547 (3 mg/kg) was given twice daily from
day 7 to day 19 by oral gavage. Cisplatin (1.5 mg/kg) was given by
intraperitoneal injection on days 7, 14, and 21 in the mice bearing
EHMES-10 cells, and cisplatin (1.0 mg/kg) was given on days 7
and 14 in the mice bearing MSTO-211H cells. The mice were
sacriﬁced 28 days (EHMES-10) or 21 days (MSTO-211H) after
tumor cell inoculation. The thoracic tumors were carefully removed
and weighed, pleural effusions were harvested using a 1-mL
syringe, and their volumes were measured.
Evaluation of microvessel density in intrapleural tumors
Frozen tissue sections were incubated with a rat polyclonal
antibody against mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen) at 4 C overnight. After washing with PBS, the slides were stained with a
biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories).
The immunoreaction was ampliﬁed with a VECTASTAIN ABC Kit
(Vector Laboratories) and visualized by incubation with a 3,
3-diaminobenzidine solution acting as a chromogen. The sections
were then counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated.
Images were captured using a microscope at a magniﬁcation of
200 (model BZ-9000; Keyence), and the area of CD31þ vessellike structures was measured in ﬁve random microscopic ﬁelds
per section using Dynamic cell count software BZ-HIC (Keyence).
Proliferation assay
EHMES-10 or MSTO-211H cells (1.5  104/100 mL) were
seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with various concentrations of SK-216 and cisplatin for 48 hours. HUVECs (1.5  104/
100 mL) were incubated with angiogenic factors (20 ng/mL
bFGF, 100 ng/mL PDGF-BB, or 30 ng/mL HGF) in the presence
of SK-216 at various concentrations for 16 and 36 hours. Cell
proliferation was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo) by measuring the absorbance of the medium.
Cell migration assay
HUVEC migration was assessed using an Oris Universal Cell
Migration Assembly Kit (Platypus Technologies). HUVECs (2 
104) suspended in 100 mL medium were seeded into each test well
of the Oris plate with the well inserts (stoppers) and then
incubated to allow cell attachment. After 4 hours, the stoppers
in each well were removed. HUVECs were incubated with angiogenic factors (20 ng/mL bFGF, 100 ng/mL PDGF-BB, or 30 ng/mL
HGF) in the presence of SK-216 at various concentrations for
36 hours and were then stained with calcein acetoxymethylester (Calcein AM) stock solution (2 mmol/L; Dojindo). Images
were captured at a magniﬁcation of 40 using a ﬂuorescence
microscope (model BZ-9000; Keyence). The areas occupied by

Inhibition of PAI-1 Suppresses Tumor Angiogenesis

HUVECs (migration area) were measured and quantiﬁed using
Dynamic cell count software BZ-HIC (Keyence).
Capillary-like tube formation assay
Seventy microliters of Matrigel was applied to each well of a
96-well plate and incubated for 30 minutes. HUVECs (7.5  103)
suspended in 100 mL medium were plated onto the Matrigel and
incubated with angiogenic factors (20 ng/mL bFGF, 100 ng/mL
PDGF-BB, or 30 ng/mL HGF) in the presence of SK-216 at various
concentrations for 16 hours and then were stained with Calcein
AM stock solution (2 mmol/L). Images were captured at a magniﬁcation of 20 using a ﬂuorescence microscope, and the total
area of the tube-like space was quantiﬁed using Dynamic cell
count software BZ-HIC.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 for
Windows (SPSS Japan). The results are expressed as mean  SEM
or median with ranges. The statistical signiﬁcance of difference
between two datasets obtained from the in vitro and in vivo
experiments was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett
post hoc test or Student t test, where applicable. The Kaplan–Meier
method was used to evaluate the survival analysis, and comparisons were made using a log-rank test. P > 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Proﬁles of angiogenic factors differed between two MPM cell
lines, EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H, in vitro and in vivo
To determine the proﬁles of angiogenic factors in two MPM cell
lines, EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H, we evaluated the expression
levels of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF in these cells. Neither
cell line was observed to secrete PDGF-BB or HGF in the culture
supernatants (data not shown). Regarding VEGF and bFGF,
EHMES-10 cells secreted much higher amounts of VEGF and
much lower amounts of bFGF compared with MSTO-211H cells
(Fig. 1A and B). To conﬁrm whether this expression pattern of
angiogenic factors was retained in vivo, the concentrations of VEGF
and bFGF were measured in the lysates of intrapleural tumors
consisting of EHMES-10 or MSTO-211H cells generated in SCID
mice. Consistent with the in vitro secretion proﬁles of angiogenic
factors, EHMES-10 cells were shown to produce much higher
amounts of VEGF and much lower amounts of bFGF than MSTO211H cells even in vivo (Fig. 1C and D).
SK-216 reduced tumor weights in both orthotopic
implantation mouse models using VEGF-high–expressing
EHMES-10 cells and bFGF-high–expressing MSTO-211H cells

was administered through drinking water at 100 or 500 ppm
to the SCID mice intrapleurally inoculated with the two MPM
cell lines. The weights of intrapleural tumors and the volume of
pleural effusions were evaluated 28 days (EHMES-10) or 21 days
(MSTO-211H) after the inoculation. Intrapleural tumors consisting of VEGF-high–expressing EHMES-10 cells were accompanied by much larger amounts of pleural effusions compared
with those of bFGF-high–expressing MSTO-211H cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2D). Administration of SK-216 at
100 and 500 ppm signiﬁcantly reduced the weights of tumors consisting of EHMES-10 cells, whereas administration of
SK-216 at 500 ppm, but not at 100 ppm, demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in weights of tumors consisting of MSTO211H cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2C). Of note, SK216 did not affect the amount of pleural effusions associated
with the tumors of EHMES-10 or MSTO-211H cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2D). On the basis of these results, we
decided to use 500 ppm as the administration dosage of SK-216
in drinking water for further experiments. To further conﬁrm

the antitumor effects of SK-216, SK-216 was then administered
through drinking water at 500 ppm to SCID mice subcutaneously inoculated with EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H cells. In
this experiment, the administration of SK-216 was started
on day 0 at the same time as cell inoculation or day 7 when
measurable (100–200 mm3) subcutaneous tumors were observed. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. S3, SK-216 reduced
the sizes of subcutaneous tumors consisting of EHMES-10
and MSTO-211H cells, regardless of whether the administration of SK-216 was started on day 0 or day 7. In addition, we
also found that administration of SK-216 did not affect the
sizes of subcutaneous tumors 7 days after cell inoculation. These
results suggested that the antitumor activity of SK-216 was
more effective against tumor progression following the establishment of tumor growth rather than during the initial phase of
tumor growth.

bevacizumab at doses of 3 or 10 mg/mouse on days 7, 10, 14,
and 17 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor weights and the amount
of pleural effusions from the mice inoculated with VEGF-high–
expressing EHMES-10 cells (Fig. 2A and B), whereas neither
dosage of bevacizumab showed inhibitory effects on the tumor
weights and the amount of pleural effusions from the mice
inoculated with bFGF-high–expressing MSTO-211H cells
(Fig. 2C and D). In contrast, administration of SK-216 at 500
ppm through drinking water signiﬁcantly reduced the weights of
intrapleural tumors consisting of EHMES-10 or MSTO-211H
cells (Fig. 2A and C); however, it was again conﬁrmed that SK216 did not exert an inhibitory effect on the amount of pleural
effusions (Fig. 2B and D).

Finally, to assess whether SK-216 suppressed tumor progression beyond its effects on inhibition of the tumor-promoting
action of VEGF and bFGF, we evaluated the antitumor effects
of SK-216 under conditions in which VEGF or bFGF was
blocked by anti-VEGF antibodies (bevacizumab) in mice bearing EHMES-10 cells or by an FGFR inhibitor (AZD4547) in
mice bearing MSTO-211H cells. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S4, the antitumor effects of bevacizumab alone and SK-216
alone were similar in mice bearing EHMES-10 cells. In addition, the antitumor effects of AZD4547 alone and SK-216 alone
were similar in mice bearing MSTO-211H cells. Furthermore,
SK-216 in combination with bevacizumab or AZD4547 was
found not to enhance the antitumor effects of bevacizumab in
mice bearing EHMES-10 cells or AZD4547 in mice bearing

the tumor-promoting action of VEGF in mice bearing VEGFoverexpressing cells or bFGF in mice bearing bFGF-overexpressing cells.
SK-216 reduced the degree of angiogenesis in intrapleural

anti-CD31 mAb. As shown in Fig. 3, SK-216 reduced the
microvessel density in both intrapleural tumors consisting of

tumor of EHMES-10 cells but failed to in that of MSTO-211H
cells (Fig. 3).
Then, we examined whether SK-216 altered the expression
level of PAI-1 in intrapleural tumors by IHC. As shown in

expression level of PAI-1 in intrapleural tumors consisting of
EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H cells.
Combined SK-216 and cisplatin enhanced the antitumor effect
of each agent alone in MPM mouse models
Because antitumor activity of SK-216 as a single agent was
demonstrated, we next questioned whether SK-216 affected the
antitumor activity of cisplatin. First, we assessed the effect of
SK-216 and/or cisplatin on the proliferation of two MPM cell lines
in vitro. The proliferation assay showed that cisplatin inhibited the
growth of both EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H cells in a dosedependent manner; however, SK-216 neither showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of these cells nor enhanced the
antiproliferative activity of cisplatin in vitro (Fig. 4A and B).
Next, the mice inoculated with EHMES-10 or MSTO-211H cells
were treated with SK-216 alone, cisplatin alone, or a combination
of SK-216 and cisplatin. In this experiment, a lower dose of
cisplatin was used for MSTO-211H cell–bearing mice (1.0 mg/kg)
than for EHMES-10 cell–bearing mice (1.5 mg/kg) because
cisplatin showed a much stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of MSTO-211H cells than that of EHMES-10 cells in vitro.
As shown in Fig. 4C and E, the cisplatin and SK-216 combination
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the tumor weights compared with
treatment with each agent alone in both mouse MPM models with
EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H cells. Although treatment with SK216 or cisplatin alone failed to inhibit the formation of pleural
effusions in EHMES-10 cell–bearing mice, the combination treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the amount of pleural effusions
(Fig. 4D). In addition, the cisplatin and SK-216 combination
treatment tended to prolong the survival time of MPM model
mice treated with each agent alone (Fig. 5).
SK-216 inhibited migration and tube formation of HUVECs
induced by bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF in vitro
Because the antiangiogenic activity of SK-216 was demonstrated in vivo irrespective of the primary angiogenic factor produced
by the tumor, we assessed whether SK-216 affected proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells induced by
bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF, as in our previous study that used
induction by VEGF (31). The proliferation assay showed that SK216 did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs in the
copresence of each angiogenic factor in culture (Fig. 6A and B).

As shown in Fig. 6C and E, however, SK-216 was found to inhibit
both migration and tube formation of HUVECs induced by bFGF,
PDGF-BB, or HGF in a dose-dependent manner. A similar inhibitory effect of SK-216 on migration and tube formation of
HUVECs was demonstrated in our previous study using VEGF
as the inducer (31).
To further conﬁrm the involvement of PAI-1 in migration and
tube formation of HUVECs, we prepared HUVECs in which PAI-1
expression was knocked down by RNA interference (Supplementary Fig. S6). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S7, silencing of PAI1 in HUVECs also inhibited migration and tube formation
induced by VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF.
Finally, to assess whether SK-216 affected downstream signaling targets of angiogenic factors in HUVECs, we examined the
effects of SK-216 on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT induced
by VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S8, SK-216 did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and AKT induced by these angiogenic factors, except for HGFinduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2.

Discussion
In this study, we found that systemic administration of a
speciﬁc PAI-1 inhibitor, SK-216, could suppress tumor progression through limiting angiogenesis in orthotopic implantation
mouse models of MPM using two MPM cell lines in which the
primary angiogenic factors differ, namely, VEGF-high–expressing
EHMES-10 cells and bFGF-high–expressing MSTO-211H cells. In
each mouse model of MPM using EHMES-10 cells or MSTO-211H
cells, the antitumor effect of cisplatin was augmented by combining it with SK-216. In vitro, inhibition of PAI-1 by SK-216
suppressed migration and tube formation of HUVECs induced
by bFGF, PDGF-BB, and HGF, as well as by VEGF, as reported
previously (31).
The most striking ﬁnding of this study is that inhibition of
PAI-1 by a PAI-1 inhibitor, SK-216, suppressed migration and
tube formation of HUVECs induced by bFGF, PDGF-BB, and
HGF, as well as by VEGF, as reported previously (31). These
results imply that inactivation of PAI-1 in the tumor environment has the potential to limit the progression of tumor
angiogenesis regardless of angiogenic factors produced by the
tumor and, therefore, can become an antiangiogenic strategy

Inhibition of PAI-1 Suppresses Tumor Angiogenesis

against any type of angiogenic factor. In addition, these results
indicate that PAI-1 plays a crucial role in migration and tube
formation of endothelial cells stimulated by any angiogenic
factors. Regarding a role of PAI-1 in the migration of endothelial cells induced by several different angiogenic factors, Prager
and colleagues demonstrated that VEGF, bFGF, and HGF stimulated the migration of endothelial cells by activating pro-uPA
and by forming uPAR–uPA–PAI-1 complexes followed by
internalization of uPAR (35, 36). Of note, the formation of
uPAR complexes and internalization of uPAR are PAI-1 dependent (35). These observations suggest a key role of PAI-1 in the
migration of endothelial cells induced by various angiogenic
factors. In addition, we assessed whether PAI-1 inhibition by
SK-216 affected the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, two
major downstream signaling targets of VEGF (37), FGF (38),
PDGF (39), and HGF (40). Our results showed that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT in HUVECs induced by these
angiogenic factors, except for HGF-induced phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, was not inhibited by SK-216. Although we cannot
explain why SK-216 inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation
of ERK1/2, our results suggested that inhibition of PAI-1 was
not largely associated with these signaling pathways. We speculate that inhibition of PAI-1 may act at a distal point where
these signaling pathways converge.
MPM is known to secrete various angiogenic factors, such as
VEGF, bFGF, PDGF, and HGF. Two MPM cell lines available to us,
EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H, were found to dominantly express
VEGF and bFGF, respectively, but secrete neither PDGF-BB nor
HGF into the culture supernatants (data not shown). Using these
two cell lines, we could establish orthotopic implantation mouse
models of MPM. As previously reported (41), we conﬁrmed that
bevacizumab could limit tumor progression through inhibition
of angiogenesis in a mouse MPM model with VEGF-high–expressing EHMES-10 cells, but not with bFGF-high–expressing MSTO211H cells. In contrast to bevacizumab, we found that SK-216
could limit tumor progression through inhibition of angiogenesis
in both MPM models using EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H cells.
These results suggest that inhibition of PAI-1 can exert antitumor
and antiangiogenic effects even in vivo irrespective of the primary
angiogenic factor produced by the tumor and are also supported
and explained by its ability to suppress migration and tube
formation of HUVECs induced by various types of angiogenic
stimuli. Regarding the formation of pleural effusion, we found
that VEGF-high–expressing EHMES-10 cells produced a large
amount of pleural effusions, but bFGF-high–expressing MSTO211H did not. In addition, bevacizumab was very effective in
inhibiting the formation of pleural effusion, whereas SK-216 was
not. These results suggest that VEGF was responsible for the
development of pleural effusions by inducing vascular permeability as described in a previous report (42), and SK-216 might
have little effect on VEGF-induced vascular permeability.
In this study, the antitumor effect of SK-216 in orthotopic
implantation mouse models of MPM was clearly demonstrated.
Because this effect is likely mediated by its antiangiogenic prop-

erties and SK-216 did not show any cytotoxic activity on MPM
cells in vitro, we then tried to determine whether inhibition of PAI1 by SK-216 affected the antitumor activity of cytotoxic agents,
such as cisplatin, in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, SK-216 did not
augment the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin. However, in the
orthotopic implantation mouse models, the cisplatin and SK216 combination treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced the antitumor
activity of each agent alone and tended to prolong the survival
time of MPM model mice treated with cisplatin alone. These
results suggest that SK-216 can enhance the antitumor effects of
cytotoxic agents, and we propose that SK-216 should be used in
combination with cytotoxic agents rather than as a single agent
when used as an antitumor agent.
In conclusion, systemic administration of SK-216, a speciﬁc
inhibitor of PAI-1, could suppress tumor progression of MPM
cells in vivo through inhibition of angiogenesis regardless of which
angiogenic factors were produced by MPM tumors. In addition,
SK-216 was shown to have an inhibitory effect on migration and
tube formation of HUVECs induced by various angiogenic factors
that are known to be secreted by MPM, such as VEGF, bFGF,
PDGF-BB, and HGF in vitro. Furthermore, the combination of
SK-216 and cisplatin was shown to enhance the antitumor effect
of each agent alone and tended to prolong the survival time of
MPM model mice treated with each agent alone. Taken together,
these results suggest that inactivation of PAI-1 by SK-216 may
become a novel strategy for inhibiting angiogenesis regardless
of the type of angiogenic stimulus and that the combination
of SK-216 and cisplatin may become a promising therapy for
MPM, which is known to secrete various angiogenic factors.
