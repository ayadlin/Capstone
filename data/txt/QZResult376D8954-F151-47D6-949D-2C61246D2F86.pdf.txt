Abstract
While novel therapeutic approaches have profoundly improved survival of multiple
myeloma (MM) patients, drug resistance and treatment refractoriness still persists.
This obstacle highly demands thorough investigation into the root and underlying
molecular mechanisms to develop more effective strategies. The advent of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the study of cancer biology and pathogenesis in recent years has
revolutionized therapy in this field and particularly opened new windows to further
understanding of tumor drug resistance. However; in spite of the fact that miRNAs
involvement in MM pathogenesis and progression has been substantially evidenced,
miRNA investigation in MM drug resistance is still in its infancy. Our knowledge of
the potential role of miRNAs in MM drug resistance comes from few recent reports
confirming that some miRNAs including miR-137/197, miR-21 and miR-221/222 could
negatively modulate drug sensitivity of MM cells. Further continuous researches are
required to exploit miRNAs to elucidate the critical mechanisms controlling drug
resistance in MM. In this review, we will highlight the most recent observations on
the role of miRNAs in MM drug resistance. Moreover, approaches and insights into
clinical application of miRNAs to overcome MM drug resistance will be discussed.

Introduction

microRNAs (miRNAs) tend to increasingly attract
attentions as the important gene regulatory elements
in the study of pathobiology of many cancers including
MM [1, 2]. These small non-coding RNA molecules play
substantial roles in post-transcriptional negative regulation
of a multitude of human genes including oncogenes and
tumor suppressors. miRNAs effectuate these functions
through partial complimentary binding of their seed
sequences (2~7nt long) to 3’UTR sites in target mRNAs
leading to translational repression or mRNA degradation
[3]. miRNAs can function as oncomiRs if their targets
are tumor suppressors (e.g. TP53, PTEN) or as tumor
suppressors if their targets are oncogenes (e.g. MYC,
MDM2) [4]. A growing body of evidence supports the role
of both categories in regulation of drug response of various
human cancers [5, 6], however; our knowledge of how
these players could really be involved in drug resistance of
MM is limited. Nonetheless; the findings of a few recent
studies suggest that some miRNAs may regulate drug

In the era of advanced technologies in cellular
and molecular genetics, our understanding of the clonal
root, pathogenesis and progression of multiple myeloma
(MM) is remarkable. Efficient techniques and tools have
helped diagnosis of MM and its pre-malignant stages
with noticeable certainty. During the past decades and
most recent years, enormous studies have been trying to
identify the mechanisms of MM disease development,
tumor expansion, biologic and clinical response to drugs
and perhaps more diligently MM drug resistance. Indeed,
development of drug refractoriness and relapse is the most
critical and as-yet not overcome obstacle in MM treatment
hampering most recent and novel therapies and imposing
significant patient-related economic costs. To tackle this
issue, more and more in depth studies are demanded to
probe the complex mechanisms underlying drug resistance
in MM to develop more powerful therapeutic agents.

response of MM cells through modulation of apoptotic,
anti-apoptotic or proliferative pathways [7-10]. Regarding
the facts that MM drug resistance is highly complicated
and also each miRNA can target at least 200 genes [11];
research on the roles of miRNAs in MM drug resistance
and whether they would be utilized as therapeutic targets
to overcome this resistance still have a long way to go.
In this review, we will discuss the concept of miRNA
involvement in drug resistance in MM by putting forward
the latest relevant findings and also some inference from
observations in other cancers.

RNA molecules interesting therapeutic targets in cancer
treatment.

Involvement of miRNA abnormalities in myeloma pathogenesis
During the past decade and also in recent years,
enormous studies have yielded reliable wealth of evidence
supporting the role of miRNAs in MM pathogenesis,
prognosis and clinical outcomes. The first evidence of
miRNA involvement in MM pathogenesis was presented
in 2005 by Al Masri et al. who showed that MM cell lines
and MM patient samples displayed a lower expression
of miR-125b, miR-133a, miR-1, miR-124a, miR-15 and
miR-16 than their normal counterparts [20]. Distinct
expression pattern of several miRNAs between MGUS
and overt MM samples compared with normal controls
also suggests role of some miRNAs in MM progression
[21]. For example, miR-21 was upregulated in both
MGUS and MM, but miR-17-92 cluster was upregulated
only in MM. Lionetti et al. found let-7e, miR-125a-5p,
and miR-99b highly upregulated in t(4;14) patients, and
some miRNAs associated with allelic imbalances or
loss of heterozygosity sites including let-7b at 22q13.31
or miR-140-3p at 16q2 [22]. Several other studies have
also shown the associations of miRNAs with MM high
risk groups, survival and isotypes [23, 24]. Most of these
studies attempted to exploit miRNA expression patterns
to discriminate MM, MGUS and normal donors and
also characterize associations with different molecular
subtypes/subgroups. However; whether miRNA
expression pattern is really altered in MM patients who
are under drug treatment, refractory to treatment or at
relapse hence possible involvement in drug resistance
has not been clearly explored. Nonetheless, implication
for role of miRNAs in resistance to bortezomib (BTZ) in
MM was provided by Neri et al. in their study presented
in a meeting in 2009 [25]. They found a different miRNA
signature in BTZ resistant cell lines compared to BTZ
sensitive lines and, interestingly, miRNAs modulated
in MM cells isolated from BTZ-resistant MM patients
clustered with those in BTZ-resistant cell lines, however;
further mechanistic approaches were not taken by the
authors. In a quite recent publication, Zhang et al. [26]
showed that exosomal miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-15a5p, miR-20a-5p and miR-17-5p, in circulating exosomes
were significantly downregulated in BTZ-resistant MM
patients suggesting correlation of these miRNAs with BTZ
resistance. The study did not follow further functional or
mechanistic explorations.

miRNA involvement in drug
response of malignant cells:
general concept
In recent years many studies have documented the
role of miRNAs in growth, proliferation and survival
of cancer cells (reviewed at [12]), and interesting
findings pinpoint interaction of miRNA networks with
oncogenic pathways [13]. Whole genome investigations
have disclosed dysregulation of miRNAs in human
malignancies and have provided evidence that miRNAs
in fact play dual roles in cancers: miRNAs can modulate
oncogenic or tumor suppressor pathways including p53,
c-MYC, RAS, on the other hand expression of miRNAs
themselves can be regulated by oncogenes or tumor
suppressors [14]. Indeed, the best known oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes are powerful regulators
of cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis [15, 16].
Irrespective of whether miRNAs’ targets are tumor
suppressors or oncogenes, their specific functional
effects will be compromised in the neoplastic context
and in either case miRNAs effects may be exploited in
favour of tumor conditions optimization. For instance,
the oncogene MDR1 is a known target of miR-451 which
is downregulated in MCF-7/DOX cell lines [17]. Low
expression of this miRNA will relieve the suppressive
effect of miR-451 on above cells hence upregulation of
MDR1 and induction of drug resistance. On the contrary,
for an oncomiR like miR-125a-5p which is overexpressed
in several cancers [18], the tumor suppressor target (e.g.
p53) will be downregulated culminating in the same
outcomes as mentioned. In both cases, cancer cells
could gain some level of resistance when exposed to
chemotherapeutic drugs. However; in an experimental
setting ectopic expression of a tumor suppressor miRNA
or knock-down of an oncomiR should lead to, respectively,
downregulation and upregulation of their targets resulting
in tumor cell apoptosis or enhancement of drug-induced
apoptosis (see also Figure 1). These findings pinpoint
the existence of an established functional feedback loop
between miRNAs and their potential targets controlling
drug response of cancer cells. Indeed the concept of
miRNA link with drug resistance/sensitivity of cancer
cells emerged due to the fact that miRNAs could also

and

et al. [29] observed that endogenous level of miR-27a was
low in BTZ-resistant MM cell lines and ectopic expression
of miR-27a in these cells sensitized them to BTZ through
suppressing CDK5 which is an oncogene with high
expression and associated with lower survival in MM [30].
CDK5 has also been shown to modulate BTZ sensitivity
of MM cells [31]. The general concept of miRNA-targetdrug network is illustrated in Figure 1.

Identification of miRNAs involved in modulation
of the effects of drugs is becoming an attractive research
focus in cancers [5, 27], although still in its infancy in
MM. In fact, the recent amazing findings that miRNAs
are able to determine the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
drugs have given rise to the field of “miRNA
pharmacogenomics” [27]. In these contexts, miRNAs are
basically parts of a triad consisting of miRNA-target-drug
which function to reduce the effect of the drug probably
through modulation of miRNA, the target gene or both.
Perhaps the best example of this scenario is resistance to
5-fluorouracil induced by miR-21 through targeting of the
tumor suppressor PTEN [28]. On the other hand, Ballabio

miRNAs involvement in drug response of MM
cells
To gain an idea of miRNA involvement in MM drug
resistance, several experimental approaches have to be
taken:

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of proposed miR-(miR’s) target-drug network in a drug resistant tumor cell. The

model indicates that the function of a drug (an outsider) will be compromised by an endogenous miRNA-target axis in a tumor cell
resistant to anti-tumor drug. Moreover, it suggests that endogenous low (TS-miR) or high (OncomiR) miRNA expression could help
maintain a drug resistant phenotype. In such a context, OncomiRs interact with and suppress their targets (basically pro-apoptotic or tumor
suppressor genes) leading to decrease in drug-induced effects (such as apoptosis, inhibition of cell cycle/proliferation). On the contrary,
underexpressed TS-miRs interact with their targets (mostly anti-apoptotic genes or oncogenes) but fail to suppress them efficiently resulting
in the same outcomes as above. This established mutual interaction between above miRNAs and their targets is usually understood through
experimental gain- or loss-of-function studies on miRNAs where drug resistant tumor cells will become sensitive to the drugs. However; it
is not clear whether miRNA alterations in drug resistant tumor cells occur due to gain or loss of genetic material during drug exposure (and
whether the drug affects genome directly or indirectly [88, 89]). TS = tumor suppressor

viability of the cells and rendered them a bit resistant
to BTZ. On the contrary, overexpression of the two
miRNAs in U266 or H929 cells reduced cell viability.
These findings implicate a role of miR-137/197 in drug
resistance of MM cells. Further exploration into the
potential mechanisms controlling these effects is still
ongoing. Zhao et al. [9] demonstrated that miR-221/222
inhibition partially reversed dexamethasone sensitivity of
MM1R cells while miR-221/222 treatment made MM1S
cells more resistant to dexamethasone. Their gain and
loss of function studies also confirmed PUMA as the
direct target of miR-221/222. Interestingly, they found
high expression of miR-221/222 and low expression of
PUMA in MM cells isolated from MM patients at relapse
compared with normal controls suggesting that inhibiting
miR-221/222 would be a promising therapeutic target in
MM. In line with this study, another group also showed
that miR-221/222 expression was higher in melphalanresistant HMCLs compared with parental lines, inhibition
of miR-221/222 induced apoptosis, induced expression
of PUMA and overcame melphalan resistance even in the
presence of BMSCs [10]. They also found that inhibition
of miR-221/222 modulated drug influx-efflux transporters
SLC7A5/LAT1 and the ABC transporter ABCC1/MRP1,
further supporting the role of these miRNAs in possibly
multiple drug resistance in MM cells.

1-miRNA analysis in some sets of human myeloma
cell lines (HMCLs) including drug resistant and parental
lines and also primary CD138+ MM cells from bone
marrow of MM patients at relapse or refractory to
treatment and normal donors. In an attempt, Munker et
al. [32] profiled miRNA expression in two HMCLs,
RPMI8226 and U266 and their resistant variants
RPMI8226/Dox6 and RPMI8226/LR5, U266Dox and
U266/LR7, respectively. They found that in comparison of
individual resistant cell lines with their respective parental
lines, multiple miRNAs were up- or downregulated.
However, they verified the chip data of only 3 miRNAs,
miR-21, miR-181a/181b and miR-565 with RT-PCR and
concluded that only miR-21 was commonly upregulated in
all melphalan-resistant clones relative to the parental ones.
Their investigation will raise the question as to whether
miRNA alterations were really due to an oncogenic
transformation in the first place or appeared solely
because of loss or gain of genetic material in the course of
establishment of drug resistance. Their observations would
have been more supported if they had used primary MM
cells from drug resistant patients to compare with those
from normal donors. Notably, miR-21 has been shown to
function as a potential oncomiR in a variety of cancers
[28, 33-35] including MM. One study demonstrated that
miR-21 could induce resistance to apoptosis triggered
by dexamethasone, doxorubicin, or BTZ in MM cells
[8]. The same group also showed that adhesion to bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) upregulated mi-21 in MM
cells and induced drug resistance by targeting RhoB, also
inhibition of miR-21 inhibited MM cells proliferation and
induced apoptotic cell death. A recent study by Leone et
al. provided further evidence that the oncogenic miR21 was indeed a potential therapeutic target in MM,
although they did not explicitly addressed the question
whether miR-21 controls drug response of MM cells [36].
Another important oncomiR is miR-221/222 cluster on
chromosome X which is reported to be overexpressed
in various malignancies including MM [7, 9, 10, 37,
38]. Zhao et al. [9] using MM1R and MM1S cell lines
as models of dexamethasone resistance and sensitivity,
respectively, showed higher expression of miR-221/222
cluster in MM1R cells than in MM1S cells.
2-Analysis of functional response of drug resistant
HMCLs or primary MM cells from MM patients (at
relapse or refractory to the drugs) following ectopic
expression of “downregulated miRNAs” or inhibition
of “up-regulated miRNAs” and comparison with normal
counterparts in all settings. In a recently published work
[39], our group found two tumor suppressor miRNAs,
miR-137 and miR-197, downregulated in HMCLs
(MM1S, MM1R, My5, H929 and 8226) and MM patients’
tumor cells compared to normal counterparts. However;
H929 and U266 cell lines had higher base line levels
of these miRNAs. Further inhibition of these miRNAs
using synthetic inhibitor oligos in H929 cells, increased

Mechanisms of miRNA-mediated drug resistance
in MM cells
As mentioned above, miRNAs function through
their targets which act like switches relaying miRNAs to
modulation of multiple cellular functions. According to
the literature, 3 signaling pathways mostly known to be
dysregulated in cancers, NFκB, Ras and p53, have been
found connected with function of various miRNAs [40].
In addition, genome-wide networks of miRNAs have
been found associated with other important oncogenic
pathways such as Myc, IFN and STAT [13]. Although the
vast majority of miRNA studies in MM have been focused
on clinical / subgroup correlations and their role in cell
viability and proliferation, only few studies addressed
miRNA and drug resistance specifically in MM drug
resistant models. In a few recent studies in MM, mostly
p53-related signaling pathway has been found modulated
by miRNAs in the context of drugs suggesting a possible
mechanism of miRNAs in regulation of drug response in
MM cells (Table 1).
Leotta et al. [41] found miR-125a-5p upregulated
in MM cell lines and patients’ tumor cells compared to
normal controls. By transfecting MM cells with miR125a-5p mimics, expression of p53-related genes declined,
whereas inhibition of miR-125a-5p reduced cell growth
and migration, and increased apoptosis. Interestingly, they
also observed that BMSCs further upregulated miR-125a5p in MM cells and in fact modulated the miR-125a-5p/

suppressor Bak1 [45] further supporting the notion that
miR-125 family contribute to drug resistance as oncomiRs.
However; these observations are not consistent with
what obtained by another group, who showed that miR125b was in fact suppressed in MM cells and its ectopic
expression triggered apoptotic and autophagic MM cell
death [46].
In the aforementioned studies by Gulla et al. and
Zhao et al. [9, 10] PUMA, a (BH3)-only Bcl-2 family
member, and a critical mediator of p53-dependent and
-independent apoptosis, was identified as the direct target
of miR-221/222 cluster. BAX and BAK, two other p53related genes, were also upregulated following inhibition
of miR-221/222 in vitro and in retrieved tumor samples
from xenograft models. Their experiments showed that
direct targeting of the miR-221-222 cluster could abrogate

p53 axis. Although modulation of drug response by miR125a-5p was not a goal in this study, it might be conceived
from their observations that miR-125a-5p could at least
play role in BMSC-induced drug resistance.
In addition, miR-125b has been shown to induce
dexamethasone resistance in MM cells by upregulating
miR-34a and suppressing SIRT1 deacetylase thus
allowing maintained acetylation and inactivation of p53
through the p53/miR-34a/SIRT1 signaling network [42].
Silencing of miR-125b upregulated p53 and enhanced
dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. miR-125b was also
reported to function as an oncomiR to mediate BTZ
resistance of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells by
targeting tumor suppressor MAD4 [44] and in pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells to induce
resistance to ATRA and doxorubicin by targeting tumor

ectopic expression of miR-21 in MM cells decreased
their apoptosis in the absence of IL-6. Whether the same
pathway will be modulated by miR-21 in a drug resistant
MM model remains to be determined. Taken above
findings as models, it seems plausible that oncomiRs in
MM could promote cell cycle, proliferation or survival
(anti-apoptotic) machinery of MM cells to prime them for
chemoresistance while blocking their tumor suppressor
targets.
The ways in which suppressed miRNAs may
contribute to drug resistance in MM look further intricate
and have not yet been clearly explored in any miRNA
study in MM. The targets of these miRNAs could be
oncogenes or anti-apoptotic proteins with basically
high expression in MM. For instance, the well-known
proto-oncogene and transcription factor c-MYC plays
critical roles in MM pathogenesis and progression and
is a strong driver of oncogenesis in lymphoma and MM
models [49-53]. c-MYC has been shown to be involved
in drug resistance in MM [54] and other hematologic
malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
[55, 56]. Furthermore, inhibition of c-MYC triggered
apoptosis in MM cells [50]. While c-MYC-repressed
miRNAs (miR-15a/16-1, miR-26a, miR-29, miR-34a, and
miR-150) and their role in regulation of c-MYC-mediated
responses (survival, inhibition of apoptosis) have been
well characterized in c-MYC-driven lymphomas [57],
how/whether miRNAs can regulate c-MYC-mediated
functional responses such as drug resistance in MM is
still not clear. It may be conceivable that overexpression
of c-MYC builds the basis for chemoresistance, as it is a
strong promoter of cell proliferation. Intriguingly, c-MYC
induces drug resistance of AML blast cells by inhibition
of cell differentiation [56]. On the contrary, in MM where
tumor cells are terminally differentiated it may interact
with other targets such as MCL-1 or survivin (a member
of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family) to induce drug
resistance. This speculation is based on the observations
that c-MYC induces resistance to Ara-C, dexamethasone
and L-Asp in AML cell lines by upregulating survivin
[58] and directs transcription of MCL-1 to control drug
response of gastric cancer cells [59]. Although these
functions of c-MYC have not been investigated in relation
with miRNAs in MM, our recently published work shows
that c-MYC regulates drug (PRIMA-1Met) response in MM
cells by interacting with miR-29a (a tumor suppressor
miRNA) [60]. We found that PRIMA-1Met downregulated
c-MYC and MCL-1 but upregulated miR-29a in MM cells
and induced apoptotic cell death. c-MYC was identified
as a direct target of miR-29a, upregulation of miR-29a
suppressed c-MYC and inhibited MM cell proliferation.
These findings led us to suggest that c-MYC might control
expression of MCL-1, therefore inhibition of proliferation
occurred due to c-MYC downregulation and apoptosis was
induced due to MCL-1 inhibition by c-MYC [61]. Further
investigation into whether this network could also control

this general mechanism of drug resistance. They suggest
that as PUMA is a downstream regulator of apoptosis,
it is likely that anti-sense-miR-221/222 therapy should
not only overcome dexamethasone resistance but also
resistance to other drugs, including Lenolinamide, as well
as p-53-dependent and -independent mechanisms of drug
resistance. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that
miR-221 expression was regulated by RelB-p52 complex
of the NFκB signaling pathway to which drug resistant
MM cells are suggested to be addicted [47]. By depleting
MM cells of RelB and p52, they found significant
downregulation of miR-221. They also showed that
RelB-p52 complex repressed expression of pro-apoptotic
gene BMF which is a known target of miR-221. These
observations pinpoint induction of anti-apoptotic pathways
as one potential mechanism of MM drug resistance by
miR-221/222.
In another study, it was shown that expression of
miR-21 was increased in MM cells following adhesion
to BMSCs [8]. Treating U266 cells with miR-21 mimics
rendered cells slightly resistant to Dex, Dox, and BTZ. The
authors provide indirect evidence that the transcription
factor NFκB may regulate miR-21 level. Inhibition of
NFκB using the inhibitor BAY had inhibitory effect on
miR-21 expression. This indicated that, at least in part,
miR-21 expression in myeloma cells was regulated
by NF-kB signaling, as also reported for miR-21 in a
study on drug resistant B-cell lymphoma cell lines [35].
Furthermore, using in silico analysis by TFSEARCH v1.3
they found a NF-kB binding site in the 5’ flank region
(~470 bp from the transcription start site) of the miR-21
gene. Moreover, they identified RhoB as the direct target
of miR-21. RhoB is a small GTPase member of the Rho
family that is involved in integrin signaling and survival,
among many other functions, however; it wasn’t further
explored in this study whether miR-21 functioned through
integrin-mediated signaling following adhesion of MM
cells to BMSCs.
Leone et al. [36] also showed that miR-21 targeted
the tumor suppressor PTEN and interacted with AKT/ERK
signaling pathways. Inhibition of miR-21 upregulated
PTEN (and BTG, RhoB) in MM cells and abrogated
AKT/ERK signaling suggesting that miR-21 could
function through this oncogenic pathway. However, it isn’t
clear whether this would also happen in a drug-treated
context to indicate the role of these pathways in miR-21mediated drug resistance. In support of these findings,
miR-21 was involved in resistance of B-cell lymphoma
cells to cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and
prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapeutic regimen through
modulation of PI3K/AKT pathway and suppression of
PTEN [35].
Importantly, miR-21 has been shown to contribute
to oncogenic potential of STAT3 signaling pathway
in MM cells [48]. In IL-6-dependent MM cells, IL-6
induced miR-21 in a strictly STAT3-dependent manner,

drug resistance in MM drug resistant models is ongoing.
We have also yielded some preliminary findings that miR137/197 could be involved in resistance of MM cells to
BTZ by targeting MCL-1 [39].
Among c-MYC-repressed miRNAs, tumor
suppressor miR-15a/16-1 were first reported to be
suppressed in chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and
found to target the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 [62].
These miRNAs, now known as regulators of cell cycle
which also target CCND1, CCND2, CD25A, MCL-1 and
WNT3 [63, 64], have been found downregulated in MM
[65, 66] and shown to be involved in BMSCs-mediated
drug resistance through induction of IL-6 and cell cycle
progression [67, 68]. Finally, tumor suppressor miR-27a
which was also reported to be downregulated in BTZ
resistant MM cells and directly targeted CDK5 [29],
could contribute to MM drug resistance by promoting cell
cycle and proliferation, however; this miRNA can target
P glycoprotein as well to induce multiple drug resistance

in leukemic cells [69]. Taken together, tumor suppressor
miRNAs may play role in MM drug resistance also by
promoting cell cycle, proliferation or survival (antiapoptosis) (illustrations at Figure 2).
Regarding the findings that BTZ could downregulate
miR-21 [8] or miR-27a [29] in MM cells, involvement
of at least these miRNAs in MM drug resistance sounds
counterintuitive as it may be expected that the drug should
not modulate the miRNAs. However; these studies did not
utilize an appropriate model of in vitro drug resistance of
MM cells nor did they use primary MM cells from MM
patients resistant to drugs or at relapse, which would give
more relevant indication of miRNA contribution to MM
drug resistance.
Whether development of drug resistance might
culminate in gain or loss of DNA hence over- or underexpression of miRNAs in MM cells is not known,
however; increase in DNA copy number has been
suggested to explain high expression of miR-221/222

Figure 2: Schematic illustration of proposed mechanisms which may control miRNA-mediated drug resistance in
MM. The two categories of miRNAs, oncomiRs and tumor suppressors have been described. In case of oncomiRs (miR-21,-221/222,-

125a/b,-451), which are overexpressed in MM cells, the targets will be downregulated. The latter are basically tumor suppressor or proapoptotic genes. This can lead to decline in drug-induced apoptosis hence drug resistance. On the contrary, for tumor suppressor miRNAs
(miR-137/197, -27a) which are underexpressed in MM cells, the targets (oncogenes or anti-apoptotic proteins) will be upregulated leading
to increase in cell proliferation and induction of drug resistance. It is important to note that mechanisms underlying alteration of above
categories of miRNAs are not clearly understood, however; some clues suggest involvement of epigenetic silencing (tumor suppressors) and
increase in gene copy number (oncomiRs). Whatever the mechanism, the inhibitory effect of miRNAs on their targets will be compromised
in the oncogenic context contributing to optimization of conditions for tumor cells (resistance to drugs).

in MM1R (dexamethasone resistant) relative to MM1S
(dexamethasone sensitive) cells [9]. Chromosomal
deletions harboring miRNA genes could also give
evidence for downregulation of some miRNAs involved
in MM drug resistance including miR-15a/16-1 cluster at
13q14.1 region which is frequently deleted in CLL and
in more than 50% of MM patients [70, 71]. Interestingly,
our group identified two tumor suppressor miRNAs, miR137/197, to be downregulated in MM cells and mapped to
a deleted region at chromosome 1 (1q21-22). However;
epigenetic mechanisms especially DNA methylation at
promoter CpG sites will also play an important role in
regulation of expression of miRNAs as evidenced for
several miRNAs in MM [72]. For example, epigenetic
silencing of miR-137 at promoter CpG sites would be
another mechanism underlying low expression of this
miRNA in MM (unpublished data).

study investigated the miRNA signature of MM side
population (SP) cells which are believed to harbour the
MM cancer initiating cells. They found the oncogenic
miR-451 upregulated in SP cells; inhibition of miR-451
increased the effectiveness of BTZ, As2O3 and melphalan
in SP cells by triggering apoptosis and decreasing
clonogenicity, although latter cells exhibited some level
of resistance to above agents compared to main population
(MP) cells. This observation may at least partly explain
relapse and refractoriness in MM patients. Moreover they
demonstrated that miR-451 activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway in SP cells through its target tuberous sclerosis
1 (TSC1), this pathway is a well-known oncogenic
pathway in cancers including MM [78-80]. Their findings
give new insights into the regulatory role of miRNAs in
MM SP cells (hence MM CSCs) biology and provide a
promising approach to overcome drug resistance in MM.
In contrast, miR-451 has been shown to be suppressed in
CSCs of some other tumors indicating context-specific
function of this miRNA [81]. Taken together, miRNA
role in the regulation of MM CSC functional responses
especially drug response will offer novel framework to
elucidate more potential mechanisms underlying MM drug
resistance and to provide more efficient tools to overcome
this complication.

miRNAs, drug resistance and the
concept of myeloma cancer stem
cell
Identification of the clonal root of MM as
supposedly the major source of drug resistance continues
to be the challenging research area in MM. The
investigations so far have shown that MM clones most
probably originate from a ‘lymphocyte with memory
B cell-like phenotype’ outside of the bone marrow
presumably germinal center of secondary lymphoid organs
[73, 74]. This has generated a wide interest in elucidation
of factors and mechanisms controlling “stemness” of
these precursor cells giving rise to MM drug resistant
malignant clones inside the bone marrow and also in
targeting these clones [75]. Technically, MM cancer stem
cells (CSCs) have been identified as a “CD138- side
population (SP)” in flow cytometric analysis of MM cell
lines and MM primary cells, with the most important
stem cell-related markers and pathways including ALDH
(aldehyde dehydrogenase), Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR being activated in MM SP cells [43, 76].
Furthermore, upregulation of drug efflux pumps (ABC
transporters) in MM SP cells suggests that MM SP cells
(CSCs) contribute largely to MM clones maintenance and
(multi-) drug resistance [43, 76].
Surprisingly, miRNAs have recently been
reported to be involved as critical regulatory elements
in self-renewal, differentiation and proliferation of both
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and leukemia stem cells
(LSCs) [77]. For instance, miR-125a and miR-125b (with
known oncogenic roles and possible link to drug resistance
in MM [41, 42] were shown to enhance self-renewal
capability of HSCs and LSCs and induce AML in mouse
models. Knowledge of the role of miRNAs in MM cancer
stem cell (CSC) biology and particularly drug resistance
is quite limited, however; Du et al. [43] in a pioneering
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Approaches to exploit miRNAs to
overcome drug resistance in MM
In light of the fact that miRNAs can target multiple
genes involved in cancer promotion or repression, current
era is witnessing the exploitation of miRNAs as new
tumor cell targets/anticancer agents. The common sense
in this approach is “inhibiting” the oncogenic miRNAs
by injecting anti-oncomiRs and “restoring” the lost
tumor suppressor miRNAs by injecting miRNA mimics.
However; our knowledge on this respect to date has been
obtained from pre-clinical evaluation of miRNAs in a
variety of tumor xenograft models [12, 82]. Although
in none of the MM-related studies miRNA therapeutic
approach has been explored in a specific in vivo MM drug
resistance platform, anti-oncomiRs or miRNA mimics
have successfully proven to bear anti-tumor activity and
display synergistic effects with anti-myeloma drugs [7,
9, 10, 36]. Of note, our recently published papers have
also demonstrated pre-clinical anti-myeloma activity of
miR-29a, -137, -197 mimics in MM xenograft models
using novel lipid-based oligo delivery system (Neutral
Lipid Emulsion) [39, 60]. It is important to note that
although the studies discussed here suggest miRNAs as
promising therapeutic tools in MM, no study so far has
been conducted to apply these molecules to MM patients’
clinical trials. Therapeutic potential, methodological
issues (profiling, targeting) and challenges associated with
efficient miRNA delivery have been reviewed elsewhere
[83-85].

To study the clinical impact of miRNAs (either antioncomiRs or mimics) on MM drug resistance, in vitro
findings on “drug resistant MM cell lines” need to be
translated into mouse xenograft models. This means that
the animal models should either provide a drug resistant
phenotype of MM or harbour drug resistant MM cell
line xenografts. Establishment of the former may require
complicated genetic manipulations and seems far from
feasibility, but for the latter xenografts can be made using
drug resistant MM cell lines such as 8226-R5 as explained
before [86]. Then the miRNA mimics or anti-oncomiRs
should be injected with or without anti-myeloma drugs
to explore the effects on tumor growth and expansion. It
is important to note that generating a mouse model with
humanized bone marrow microenvironment in these
settings will yield more concrete results on the effects
of miRNAs on MM drug resistance. The latter scenario
will also address the unavoidable protective influence of
bone marrow microenvironment components (BMSCs and
extracellular matrix protiens) on MM cells.

these questions, one need to be cautious to justify actual
miRNA involvement in MM drug resistance inside the
MM patient’s bone marrow microenvironment based on
in vitro and in vivo observations. Furthermore, in spite of
applicability of strategies in in vivo studies, the major issue
is still with the ways miRNAs should be applied to human
subjects, i.e. directing the miRNAs to the bone marrow
microenvironment and targeting only the MM clones.

The rising number of studies on miRNAs role in
MM pathobiology, progression and prognosis and their
therapeutic has created a new horizon in MM treatment
especially in combination with efficient anti-myeloma
drugs. However; drug resistance in MM continues to be
the most challenging obstacle to MM therapy directing
nowadays most research focus toward miRNAs to
decipher the potential molecular mechanisms underlying
resistance to therapy, however; investigation in this respect
is still in its infancy in MM.
It should also be noted that drug resistance occurring
due to adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs inside the bone
marrow is now evidenced to be the major hub to focus
in MM pathophysiology [87] hence even demanding
far deeper and broader exploration into molecular
mechanisms of MM drug resistance. We have found that
BMSCs suppress several miRNAs including miR-101-3p
and upregulate the oncogene c-FOS and the anti-apoptotic
protein survivin in MM cells following cell-cell interaction
even when the system is exposed to BTZ. These findings
imply involvement of miR-101-3p in BMSCs-induced
resistance to BTZ probably through c-FOS or survivin.
As the last remark, given involvement of miRNAs
in drug resistance in MM, some important questions
concerning the experimental models used will be raised:
How are miRNAs in drug resistant cells suppressed or
upregulated? Are these changes actually happening due
to the oncogenic process in the first place paving the
way for development of drug resistance? Are these byproducts of the neoplastic phenomenon? Or, they arise
following gain or loss of the genetic material due to drug
treatment? Perhaps until finding appropriate answers to
