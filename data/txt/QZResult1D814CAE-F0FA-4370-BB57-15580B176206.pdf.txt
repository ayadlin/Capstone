Abstract
Germ-line heterozygosity of the BRCA2 gene in women
predisposes to breast and ovarian cancers. Successful therapies targeted specifically at these neoplasms have thus far
remained elusive. Recent studies in mice have shown that
inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) targets
cells lacking Brca2 and xenografts derived from BRCA2deficient ES cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells. We set out to
develop a more relevant preclinical model that will inform
and accelerate translation into the clinic. As such, we
conditionally deleted Brca2 and p53 within murine mammary
epithelium and treated the resulting tumors in situ with a
highly potent PARP-1 inhibitor (AZD2281) alone or in
combination with carboplatin. Daily exposure to AZD2281
for 28 days caused significant regression or growth inhibition
in 46 of 52 tumors. This response was shown to be specific
to tumors lacking both Brca2and p53. AZD2281/carboplatin
combination therapy for 28 days showed no advantage over
carboplatin monotherapy. However, if PARP inhibitor treatment was continued, this significantly increased the time to
tumor relapse and death in these mice. This preclinical study
is the first to show in vivo hypersensitivity of spontaneously
arising Brca2-deficient mammary tumors to PARP-1 inhibition monotherapy or combination therapy. As such, our data
add substantial weight to the argument for the use of PARP
inhibitors as therapeutic agents against human breast cancers
in which BRCA2 is mutated. Moreover, the specificity that we
have shown further suggests that PARP inhibitors will be
generally effective against tumors caused by dysregulation of
components of the homologous recombination pathway.

Introduction
BRCA2 acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with the
RAD51 protein during homologous recombination (HR), a process
by which DNA is repaired in an error-free manner (1). Deficiency in
BRCA2 leads to the employment of error-prone systems of DNA
repair, such as nonhomologous end joining, resulting in the types of

complex genomic rearrangements that are often the hallmark of
tumors caused by such mutations (1). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors have been intensively preclinically tested as
potentiators of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (2) and several have
recently entered early clinical trials (3). One of the functions of
PARP enzymes, particularly PARP-1 and PARP-2, is in the repair of
single-stranded DNA breaks (4). Inhibition of this process has been
shown to lead to the accumulation of double-stranded breaks, due
to the apparent collapse of stalled replication forks, and this opens
up a therapeutic window in BRCA2-deficient cells because of their
inability to repair these lesions in an error-free manner (4). Several
studies in cells and xenograft tumor models have shown that
BRCA2 deficiency does indeed sensitize to PARP inhibition (5–7)
and also that PARP inhibition sensitizes cells characterized by
dysregulation of several other components of the HR pathway (8).
These studies have led to the proposal that PARP inhibitors will act
as a successful targeted therapy against tumors defective in the HR
pathway. However, the response of a relevant preclinical tumor
model has yet to be shown.
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a potent
PARP-1 inhibitor against Brca2-deficient tumors arising naturally
in a relevant preclinical mouse model both alone and in
combination with an established chemotherapeutic agent. Critically, this model carries important advantages over the xenograft
models previously used, in that the tumors arise spontaneously in
the mammary gland and are therefore subject to the normal
microenvironment and host cell response.

Materials and Methods
Genotyping of mice. PCR conditions for the blg-cre transgene and the
Brca2fl, p53fl , and ptenfl alleles have all been described previously (9–12).
Formulation of AZD2281. AZD2281 (13) was dissolved at 45 mg/mL in
DMSO and diluted to 4.5 mg/mL in PBS containing 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-hcyclodextrin. 10% DMSO in PBS/10% 2-hydroxypropyl-h-cyclodextrin was
used as vehicle.
Treatment of mice. AZD2281 and carboplatin were both injected at
50 mg/kg by single bolus intraperitoneal injection. Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) labeling reagent (GE Healthcare) was intraperitoneally injected at
30 mg/kg 2 h before animals were culled. Mice were fed standard diet and
water ad libitum and all experimental procedures were carried out
according to current UK Home Office regulations.
Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of AZD2281 in Brca2/p53mutant mammary tumors. Tumors were removed from mice that were
untreated or had received a single intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/kg
AZD2281 either 2 or 24 h previously. Tumor tissue was analyzed for the
presence of AZD2281 by mass spectrometry as described previously (7). To
determine levels of PARP activity, tumor whole-cell extracts were first

PARP Inhibitor Treatment of Brca2/p53-Mutant Tumors
analyzed by Western blotting, using the anti-PARP-1 mouse monoclonal
antibody 7D3-6 (BD Bioscience), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence
detection and quantitative image capture analysis (LAS-3000; Fuji/Raytek).
The PARP-1 protein concentration for each extract was determined by twodimensional densitometry against PARP-1 standards using Advanced Image
Data Analyzer imaging software. The equivalent of 20 pg PARP-1 of mouse
tumor whole-cell extracts was then activated ex vivo by incubating with
double-stranded DNA oligos and NAD+ to stimulate poly(ADP-ribosylation)
(PAR formation). PAR formation was then quantified by electrochemiluminescence with a Meso Scale assay, using the anti-PAR mouse monoclonal
primary antibody 10H (Serotec), followed by the goat anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibody SULFO-TAG (Meso Scale).
Analysis of tumor size. Treatment of palpable tumors was initiated
when they reached a size that was measurable accurately by the use of
manual spring-loaded calipers. As tumors were treated in situ, the starting
volumes of tumors varied slightly depending on their position on the body
and the ease with which it was possible to start accurate measurement.
Tumor volumes were calculated as length  (square of width) / 2 and were
taken on the day that treatment started and then usually twice per week
henceforth.
Tumor tissue analysis. Tumors were removed from freshly culled mice
and tissue was either fixed in formalin and subsequently embedded in
paraffin wax for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen for subsequent protein purification, or stored in RNAlater
(Sigma) for subsequent RNA purification using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen).

Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry for BrdUrd was done
as described previously (14). Cytokeratin 8 was detected using a chicken
polyclonal antibody (Abcam; 14053) at 1:800 dilution, vimentin using a
rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; C-20) at 1:50 dilution,
and Ki-67 using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Vector Laboratories;
VP-K452) at 1:20 dilution.
Western blotting. Proteins were extracted from snap-frozen tissue by
homogenization in a modified RIPA buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% NP-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA (pH 7.4)]
and de-glycosylated using the N-Glycosidase F Deglycosylation Kit (Roche).
Bcrp-1 was detected using the rat monoclonal antibody bxp-53 (Abcam) at
1:2,000. Equal loading of proteins was assessed using a rat monoclonal
antibody against a-tubulin (Abcam) at 1:2,000. Visualization was via
enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).
Real-time multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for
multidrug-resistant proteins. Real-time multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification reactions were done as described elsewhere (15).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Reactions were done as
described previously (16) using established primers for Brca2 (17) and
p53 (16) expression.
Data analysis. Statistical analyses were done using the nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test, except for comparisons of tumor relapse and mouse
survival (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), which were done using the
nonparametric Wilcoxon test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results and Discussion
Generation and characterization of Brca2/p53 -mutant
mammary tumors. To generate mammary tumor-bearing mice,
we used cre-lox technology to conditionally delete genes specifically within mammary epithelium. For this, we used the blg-cre
transgene, which is known to be specific to mammary epithelial
cells (9). Mice carrying the blg-cre transgene were crossed with
mice carrying the floxed Brca2 (10) and p53 (11) alleles to generate
blg-cre + Brca2fl/fl p53fl/fl and blg-cre + Brca2fl/fl p53fl/+ animals.
Animals of these genotypes developed mammary tumors from as
early as age 6 months. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
showed that levels of Brca2 and p53 were very low (V20%) in a
panel of 9 tumors (data not shown), indicating that deletion of
these two genes was responsible for tumor development.
Furthermore, histologic analysis of 34 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B) revealed morphologic changes consistent with
previous studies of murine tumors characterized by mutation of
both Brca2 and p53 (11, 18).
To determine if we could deliver inhibitory concentrations of the
highly potent PARP-1 inhibitor AZD2281 to Brca2/p53-deficient
mammary tumors, we simultaneously measured levels of AZD2281
and assayed for PARP-1 activity following treatment. Two hours
after a single injection of 50 mg/kg AZD2281, the inhibitor was
present in the tumors at high levels and PARP activity was reduced
significantly (Supplementary Fig. S1C; Mann-Whitney, P = 0.013;
n = 6). By 24 h after dosing, the inhibitor had been cleared from
the tumors and PARP activity had returned to pretreatment levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1C).
AZD2281 regresses spontaneously arising Brca2/p53-mutant
mammary tumors. To analyze the effect of AZD2281 as a monotherapy, Brca2/p53-deficient tumor-bearing mice were treated
daily with PARP inhibitor or vehicle. Changes in tumor size were
measured biweekly and tumor volumes were calculated and compared with the measured volume on the first day of treatment
to give the relative tumor volume (RTV). Eighteen vehicle-treated
mice all showed rapid tumor growth throughout the 28-day period
of treatment, with 3 mice being sacrificed before day 28 due to
deteriorating health associated with growth of the tumor (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, of 52 tumors arising in mice that were subsequently
treated with AZD2281, 46 showed significant responses ranging
from cessation of tumor growth to substantial regression (Fig. 1A).
Of these, 3 were in mice that were culled before the end of the
28-day period of treatment due to deteriorating health. Comparison of RTV at day 28 (Fig. 1A) shows a significant response to
AZD2281 therapy in comparison with vehicle (Mann-Whitney,
P < 0.0001; n = 15 for vehicle and n = 47 for AZD2281). To
determine whether AZD2281 showed specific activity against
mammary tumors lacking Brca2, we also tested the response in
tumors caused by deletion of either p53 or pten in mammary
epithelium (Fig. 1B and C). There was no significant difference
following vehicle or AZD2281 treatment in either cohort of mice.
To assess tumor proliferation following 28 days of treatment, mice
from all treatment cohorts were injected with the S-phase labeling
reagent BrdUrd 2 h before sacrifice, and tissue sections from these
tumors were stained with an antibody against BrdUrd. The results
indicate that proliferation was significantly reduced in Brca2/p53deficient tumors when mice had been treated with AZD2281
(Fig. 1D; Mann-Whitney, P = 0.0061; n = 5). However, there was no
reduction in tumor proliferation following AZD2281 treatment in
either p53- or pten-deficient tumor-bearing animals (data not

shown). These data show conclusively that AZD2281 is highly
effective against tumors defective in Brca2. Moreover, this
specificity strongly argues that PARP inhibition will be effective
against other tumors characterized by dysregulation of the HR
pathway as suggested previously (8).
Analysis of the long-term response to AZD2281 treatment.
We next wanted to understand the long-term consequences of
treatment with AZD2281. Figure 2 shows the responses of tumors
from mice that had been treated for 28 days with vehicle (Fig. 2A),
28 days with AZD2281 (Fig. 2B), or continuously with AZD2281
(Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the tumors from either cohort of AZD2281
treatment always relapsed, although this response was heterogeneous in nature, as several tumors showed longer-term responses
before relapsing.
Resistance in the clinic is detrimental to a range of therapies,
and as such, it is important that we understand the underlying
mechanisms. Using a panel of 16 AZD2281-resistant tumors, we
firstly performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and found

that levels of Brca2 and p53 were as low as those seen in untreated
tumors (data not shown). This allowed us to rule out the possibility
that resistance to AZD2281 was caused by a secondary mutation
within the Brca2 gene in these tumors as recently reported in two
independent studies (19, 20). Such a genetic event would be very
unlikely in our model system anyway, due to the nature of the large
deletion, which conditionally inactivates the Brca2 gene. To test
another potential mechanism of resistance to AZD2281, we
analyzed the same tumors in terms of their multidrug-resistant
(MDR) expression profiles using real-time multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (15, 16). In 11 of 16 tumors
analyzed, it was noted that at least a 2-fold up-regulation of one
or more MDR transporters had occurred (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
Western blotting of proteins from these tumors with an antibody
against Bcrp-1 showed up-regulation of the protein in three of the
tumors suggested by real-time multiplex ligation-dependent probe
amplification, most notably in tumor R14, which also showed the
highest increase in expression at the RNA level (Fig. 3B). Although
these results suggest that we are seeing up-regulation of MDR in a
subset of AZD2281-resistant tumors, our model system does not
allow us to directly compare levels between these tumors and the
untreated tumors from which they originated. However, our data
do suggest that altered MDR levels may be a significant mechanism
of resistance in these tumors and that additional treatment with
MDR inhibitors may further improve the effectiveness of PARP
inhibitor therapy in such resistant tumors in the clinic.
If elevated MDR activity does mediate resistance within this
model, one might hypothesize cross-resistance to other therapeutics. To address this, we assessed platinum sensitivity in 9 tumors,
which developed resistance during continuous AZD2281 treatment.
Eight of 9 responded to subsequent carboplatin treatment (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that resistance to AZD2281 does not usually confer
resistance to carboplatin. The MDR proteins that we have shown to
be up-regulated are rarely implicated in platinum resistance (21);
therefore, the fact that the majority of tumors retained carboplatin
sensitivity can probably be explained by drug-specific MDR activity.
Our data therefore implicate MDR up-regulation in resistance to
AZD2281. However, this does not rule out other potential
mechanisms, such as altered DNA repair activity, which has been
shown previously to mediate resistance to platinum (22).
Analysis of AZD2281/carboplatin combinatorial therapy. We
next wanted to analyze the effect of a combination treatment of
PARP-1 inhibition with a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent.
Recently, AZD2281 has been shown to synergize with platinum
compounds against cells derived from tumors deficient in both
Brca2 and p53 (17). To test this in a true in vivo setting, we treated
Brca2/p53-deficient tumor-bearing mice with daily injections of
AZD2281 or vehicle combined with weekly injections of carboplatin
on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (1 h following AZD2281/vehicle treatment)
and measured tumor size over a 28-day period. Tumors in both
cohorts (CARB and COMBO) responded to treatment in a similar
way (Fig. 4A and B) and we found that there was very little BrdUrd
staining in any of these tumors at day 28, although occasional foci
of BrdUrd positivity were observed in tumors from both treatment
cohorts (data not shown). In addition, we stained day 28 tumor
sections for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and scored for positivity
and also scored H&E-stained sections of the same tumors for
mitosis. Although both therapy regimens showed a reduction in
both Ki-67 staining and mitosis compared with AZD2281 alone
(Supplementary Fig. S2), there was no significant difference
between the two therapeutic regimens at this time point. In terms

of mechanism of interaction between the two therapeutics, it is
possible that PARP inhibitors and platinum are both dependent on
functional HR, although this is far less clear for platinum than it is
for PARP inhibitors (23).
These experiments show that, for the regression of tumors,
additional AZD2281 treatment did not enhance carboplatin
monotherapy during the initial treatment period of 28 days. This is
most likely due to the high dose of carboplatin that we used, such
that we were unable to see any additional effect of AZD2281. We
therefore extended our observations by analyzing the length of
time taken for tumors to relapse following five different treatment
regimens: 28 days of AZD2281 treatment (AZD2281; Fig. 2B), continuous AZD2281 treatment (AZD2281+; Fig. 2C), 28 days of carboplatin treatment (CARB; Fig. 4C), 28 days of combination AZD2281/
carboplatin (COMBO; Fig. 4C), or 28 days of carboplatin with

continuous daily treatment with AZD2281 (COMBO+; Fig. 4C). Time
to relapse was defined as the day at which the tumor had doubled
in size from its lowest volume. Extended treatment with AZD2281
after the initial 28-day combination treatment (COMBO+) resulted
in a significant delay to tumor relapse compared with all other
treatments (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Table S1). At day 100 after
treatment started, only 6 of 20 (30%) of CARB-treated tumors and
3 of 16 (19%) COMBO-treated tumors were still below their initial
volume compared with 14 of 25 (56%) tumors treated with COMBO+
therapy. By day 120, only 1 of 20 (5%) CARB-treated and 1 of 16 (6%)
COMBO-treated tumors were still below their initial volume
compared with 8 of 25 (32%) tumors treated with COMBO+ therapy.
Additionally, tumor-bearing mice that received the COMBO+
treatment survived significantly longer than those that received
any of the other treatments (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Table S2). Taken

PARP Inhibitor Treatment of Brca2/p53-Mutant Tumors

together, these results clearly show that continued PARP inhibition
enhanced carboplatin monotherapy or PARP inhibitor/carboplatin
combinatorial therapy in terms of tumor relapse and mouse survival.
Critically, this enhancement occurs without any increase in
toxicity. Attempts to treat beyond the initial 28-day period with
carboplatin resulted in significant mortality (data not shown). By
contrast, continuous treatment with AZD2281 did not lead to any
observed toxicity. Furthermore, although toxicity was observed in
the combined therapy regimen, this was no higher than following
carboplatin monotherapy (data not shown).
There is currently considerable excitement about the potential of
novel anticancer strategies based on the notion of synthetic
lethality. Principal among these is the use of PARP inhibition to
sensitize HR-deficient tumor cells. To date, efficacy of these agents
has only been established within defined experimental settings
such as clinically irrelevant xenografts derived from ES cells or
Chinese hamster cells (5–8) but not within spontaneously
developing tumors arising in directly relevant preclinical models.
Here, we show for the first time that mammary tumors arising in a
genetically appropriate Brca2-/- setting show a dramatic response
to treatment with a potent PARP-1 inhibitor.
Critically, this model has allowed us to go beyond simple assessment of monotherapy, as we have shown combined exposure to
AZD2281 and carboplatin to significantly increase the length of time
taken for tumors to relapse. This ability to rapidly assess combina-

torial drug interactions in a true tumor setting should accelerate
both the development of the optimal clinical regimens and our
understanding of the basis of resistance. As such, by altering the doses
and scheduling of the two compounds, we are now attempting to
develop a combinatorial treatment regimen, which will maintain the
efficacy that we have thus far shown but which may also reduce the
toxicity of the platinum compound and further delay tumor relapse.
In conclusion, our data establish a paradigm for the successful
tailoring of treatment to genetic status and provide further evidence
that treatment of HR-defective tumors with a combination of PARP
inhibition and standard chemotherapy will be clinically effective.
