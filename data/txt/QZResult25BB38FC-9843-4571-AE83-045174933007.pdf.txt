BACKGROUND: Phase 3 clinical trials performed primarily outside the US demonstrate that intravesical
instillation of chemotherapy immediately after transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) decreases
cancer recurrence rates. The authors sought to determine whether US urologists have adopted this practice, and its potential effect on costs of bladder cancer (BC) care. METHODS: By using 1997-2004 MEDSTAT claims data, the authors identified patients with newly diagnosed BC who underwent cystoscopic
biopsy or TURB, and those who received intravesical chemotherapy within 1 day after TURB. Economic
consequences of this treatment compared with TURB alone were modeled using published efficacy estimates and Medicare reimbursements. The authors used a time horizon of 3 years and assumed that this
treatment was given for all newly diagnosed low-risk BC patients. RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2004, the
authors identified 16,748 patients with newly diagnosed BC, of whom 14,677 underwent cystoscopic biopsy
or TURB. Of these, only 49 (0.33%) received same-day intravesical instillation of chemotherapy. From 1997
through 2004, there has been little change in the use of this treatment. The authors estimated a 3-year savings of $538 to $690 (10% to 12%) per patient treated with TURB and immediate intravesical chemotherapy
compared with TURB alone, reflecting a yearly national savings of $19.8 to $24.8 million. CONCLUSIONS:

Treatment of Stage Ta, T1 Bladder Cancer/Madeb et al

Bladder cancer is the 4th most commonly diagnosed
cancer in men and the 8th in women in the US. An estimated 61,420 new cases will be diagnosed in 2007, and
13,060 patients will die of this disease.1
Seventy-five percent of newly diagnosed bladder
cancers are nonmuscle invasive (NMI).2,3 These cancers
often recur after seemingly complete transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) because of new tumor development in other regions of the urothelium, tumor cell
implantation resulting from spontaneous perturbations or
those induced by instrumentation, and/or incomplete
resection of the original malignancy.4,5
Although recurring well and moderately differentiated NMI bladder cancer rarely progresses to a life-threatening condition, repeated TURBs and courses of
intravesical instillations of immuno- and chemotherapeutic agents cause considerable inconvenience, expense, and
morbidity. A single instillation of chemotherapy immediately after TURB has been proposed as a means of reducing recurrence by decreasing procedure-facilitated tumor
implantation and eradicating field effect or persistent
(incompletely resected or unrecognized) tumors.5-7 For
over a decade, several prospective randomized-controlled
clinical trials have shown that this treatment is safe and
decreases recurrences by 17% to 44% compared with controls8-10 (Table 1), particularly for patients with newly
diagnosed bladder cancers.5-7,11-13 Agents used include
mitomycin C, doxorubicin, and thiotepa (all available in
the US), as well as epirubicin and Epodil (neither available
in the US).
In view of this evidence, we set out to determine
whether US urologists have adopted this practice and to
ascertain whether implementing post-TURB intravesical
instillation therapy would be cost-saving.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The study was based on the analysis of individual medical
claims provided by MEDSTAT (www.MEDSTAT.com),
a healthcare information company currently following
over 7 million covered lives, which provides benchmark
databases and research services for managing costs and
quality of healthcare in the US. We used MEDSTAT’s
Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and MediCancer

June 15, 2009

care Supplemental Coverage claims databases, which have
been validated and used for oncological and nononcological research studies.8-10 These databases are generally representative of the US population in terms of sex (49%
male). The mean ages of the CCAE and Medicare populations were 34 and 74 years, respectively. This compares
with a mean age of 72 years for all Medicare beneficiaries
and 75 years if only those 65 years and older are included.
A higher percentage of individuals included in MEDSTAT databases reside in the Southern US (50%) than
the general population, whereas 36% of Medicare beneficiaries live in the Southern US.14

Study Sample and Drug Use
By using 1997-2004 MEDSTAT claims, we identified
bladder cancer patients based on the International Classification of Diseases–Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code of
188.9. We chose 1997 because it was the first calendar
year after a positive large randomized clinical trial using
an agent readily available in the US was reported in the
American literature.11,13,15 Several studies have examined
the accuracy of ICD-9 coding for various conditions compared with medical records and physician assessment, and
demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity in
identifying patients with index conditions (diabetes,
chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, cerebral vascular
accident, and stroke).16-18 Figure 1 presents the algorithm
used to identify newly diagnosed patients with bladder
cancer who received same-day post-TURB intravesical
chemotherapy. We then identified patients who underwent cystoscopy with biopsy or TURB for any size bladder tumor (using Current Procedure Terminology [CPT]
codes 52,204, 52,224, 52,234, 52,235, and 52,240).
From these, using prescription drug claims and National
Drug Code and CPT codes, we selected patients who
received an intravesical instillation of a chemotherapeutic
agent (mitomycin C, doxorubicin, or interferon alpha) on
the day of, or the day after TURB. Administration of immediate intravesical therapy post-TURB is billed as an
outpatient/ambulatory procedure (CPT 51,720) rather
than a prescription drug, because it can only be administered by qualified medical personnel. Use of administrative claims data for evaluation of patterns of healthcare use
is quite common and has been validated.8-10 Moreover,

because errors in billing would lead to problems with payments, the quality of billing data is generally high.19

Cost and Utilization
On the basis of prospective, randomized studies reported
in the English language literature, we identified standard
care and likely outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed NMI bladder cancer after initial TURB with 0, 1,
2, or 3 episodes of recurrence over a 3-year period.20-29
To assign cost values to the typical utilization associated
with each of the recurrence patterns, with and without immediate post-TURB intravesical instillation of chemotherapeutic agents, we used Medicare reimbursement fees
for the related procedures and medications (Table 2). We
Cancer

June 15, 2009

assumed that all predicted recurrences would be recognized at the first (3 month) cystoscopy after the most
recent TURB. In 1 analysis, we assumed intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) would be used after the initial recurrence, whereas in the second we assumed
mitomycin C would be.
The results for each analysis are presented as an average cost per patient for a 3-year period. For the group not
receiving immediate post-TURB instillation therapy, we
assumed that 60% would not have a recurrence during
this period.26 For the first analysis, the initial recurrence
would be treated with induction (and maintenance, if successful) BCG, and BCG þ alpha-interferon would be
used after the second recurrence. For the group receiving
same-day intravesical instillation therapy, we assumed
that recurrences would be reduced by 25% and that initial
and second recurrences would be treated with induction
and maintenance BCG and BCG þ alpha-interferon,
respectively, with the same the efficacy as for those not
receiving same-day intravesical instillation therapy who
recurred.
In the second analysis, we assumed that 6 instillations of mitomycin C would be given for the initial recurrence, and those experiencing a second recurrence would
receive induction (and maintenance, if successful) BCG,
whereas those with a second recurrence would receive
BCG þ alpha-interferon. The efficacy of these agents was
assumed to be the same as in our first analysis. The same
assumption was made for the efficacy of immediate postTURB intravesical therapy as in the first analysis: a 25%
reduction in first recurrences. The 3-year time horizon
was chosen, because the overwhelming majority of bladder cancer recurrences occur within this period.26 In

addition, the American Urological Association (AUA)
protocol is set for intense follow-up for 3 years after the
initial TURB to detect recurrence and then switches to a
less intense regimen. Furthermore, we believe that the majority of patients do not undergo more than 3 resections
of bladder cancer and therefore have spread it over a 3year period, which would typically be seen in patients
with low-risk disease. We assumed that prior use of intravesical chemotherapy after TURB would have no effect
on the progression of subsequently diagnosed muscleinvasive bladder cancer. We did not apply discounting in
this study, because we did not anticipate a dramatic effect
over a 3-year period.
Because same-day intravesical instillation therapy is
not recommended for high-grade or muscle-invading cancers, carcinoma in situ (TIS), or predominantly nonurothelial cancers, we assumed that no patients in our analysis
had these cancers. To be very conservative in terms of predicting cost savings and effectiveness, we assumed no
patient would progress to high grade, TIS, or stage T2 þ
disease during the period of follow-up (because progression to any of these stages/grades mandates more complex
and expensive therapies).
Because there is wide variation in the reported efficacy of intravesical instillation therapy, we conducted a
threshold analysis to estimate the minimal effectiveness of
this treatment required to balance the added cost of medication and care compared with the standard TURB. To
perform the threshold analysis, we expressed the average
cost of a patient treated with mitomycin C for the first
occurrence as a function of risk reduction, compared the
average cost of a patient treated with BCG for the first
occurrence of bladder cancer to the average cost of a
patient treated with mitomycin C, and solved this equation for risk reduction. This value represented the minimal treatment effect needed for the 2 options to be
considered equal in terms of cost.

RESULTS
Use of an Intravesical Chemotherapeutic
Agent After TURB
By using the CCAE and Medicare databases from 1997 to
2004, we identified 16,748 patients whose claims listed
bladder cancer as their primary or secondary diagnosis.
From 1997 through 2004, 444,740 patients were estimated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
data to develop bladder cancer,30 and thus 4% of all newly
diagnosed bladder cancers were captured by these databases. A total of 14,677 (87.6%) subsequently underwent
cystoscopy with biopsy or TURB of their bladder cancer
(Table 3). Of these, only 49 (0.33%) received same- or
following-day instillation therapy after their surgical procedure (Table 3). Most of these patients received mitomycin C (48 of the 49; 98%), whereas 1 patient (2%)
received interferon alpha-2B. No patient received doxorubicin or thiotepa. When analyzing data from between
1997 and 2004, we detected no statistically significant
changes in the annual rates of new diagnosis or treatment
of bladder cancer, or the use of same-day intravesical therapy after TURB in this cohort (Table 3).
Economic Benefits of Instilling Intravesical
Chemotherapy Immediately After TURB
For the base case analysis, we assumed that the treatment
was given for all newly diagnosed low-risk patients (grades
1 and 2 and stages Ta and T1). By evaluating the literature, we estimated that bladder cancer patients without
recurrence for >3 years will receive 10 surveillance cystoscopies (Fig. 2). Based largely on AUA guidelines and
the results of randomized clinical trials,20-26,28,29,31
patients who had recurrences underwent further resections and 6 weekly instillations of BCG with 3 maintenance instillations of BCG every 6 months for 3 years.

Of those starting this course, we assumed that 25% would
recur and undergo another TURB followed by instillations with BCG and alpha-interferon. Of these patients,
we assumed that 60% would recur. Treatment after a second or third recurrence in this brief a time is not standardized20-26,28,29,31; to be extremely conservative, we
assumed patients would subsequently not recur and be
observed closely (ie, frequent cystoscopies) (Fig. 2). The second model used mitomycin C for the first recurrence,
assuming 50% would recur during the period of followup.20,22-25,27,31-34 The second recurrence was treated with
induction BCG and maintenance therapy if successful, and
BCG þ alpha-interferon was used for the third recurrence.
The anticipated efficacy of BCG and BCG þ alpha-interferon was assumed to be the same as in the first analysis. As
with model 1, we assumed patients experiencing a third recurrence would not recur subsequently, and be managed by
frequent monitoring. Because the literature is equivocal
regarding advantages of post-TURB single-instillation
intravesical therapy in patients with recurrent bladder cancers,7,29 we did not presume that patients with recurrences
would receive this treatment.11,35
With the utilization rates and outcomes discussed,
we estimated that without same-day therapy and assuming
BCG was administered at first recurrence (model 1) it
would cost on average $5760 to treat 1 patient with lowrisk NMI bladder cancer for 3 years (Table 4). If all
2666

patients receive same-day post-TURB intravesical chemotherapy (we assumed mitomycin C would be used), the average per patient cost of 3 years of care is reduced to
$5070, a cost savings of $689 (12%) per patient for treatment with same-day intravesical chemotherapy compared
with TURB alone. Nationally, this represents annual savings of $24.8 million (60% of newly diagnosed bladder
cancer per year1,36). A similar analysis was done with
patients receiving mitomycin C on initial recurrence, BCG
for the second recurrence, and BCG and alpha-interferon
for the third. This would save $538 per patient and save
$19.8 million nationally (Fig. 2, Table 4). Even if patients
who failed the first BCG induction course were treated
with a repeat course of BCG rather than BCG þ alphainterferon, the savings for immediate post-TURB intravesical instillation therapy would still be substantial: $21.2 million if BCG was used for the first recurrence, and $19.8
million if mitomycin C was used (data not shown).
Our threshold analysis demonstrated that the addition of single-dose intravesical therapy after TURB must
decrease recurrence by at least 7% (for the BCG assumption) to 10% (for mitomycin C) to cover the additional
cost of services and medication.

DISCUSSION
Despite compelling evidence regarding the effectiveness
of same-day intravesical therapy, between 1997 and 2004,
Cancer

June 15, 2009

Treatment of Stage Ta, T1 Bladder Cancer/Madeb et al

only 0.33% of eligible US patients received this treatment. We demonstrated that in addition to reducing the
rate of bladder cancer recurrences, same-day intravesical
therapy could also save $538 to $689 of medical expenses
per patient, or over $15 to nearly $25 million a year
nationally.
The rationale behind single immediate instillation
intravesical chemotherapy is that by reducing the rate of
implantation, the likelihood of disease recurrence will
decrease, as will the need for repeat TURBs and for longer
courses of intravesical therapy. Table 1 reviews the results
of randomized prospective trials of same-day intravesical
instillation chemotherapy after TURB. This treatment
has been shown to reduce recurrences by 17% to 44%
compared with controls. A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that this treatment has decreased the risk of recurrence by 39% in patients with stage Ta and T1 bladder
cancer.37
The purpose of the analysis was to provide a conservative estimate of the economic benefit associated with
using intravesical chemotherapy after TURB in the US.
Because differences between countries in terms of healthcare systems (eg, financing and organization) could have a
substantial impact on the types of services patients receive,
it is necessary to focus on a specific healthcare system. We
chose the US healthcare system, and specifically the health
insurer’s perspective, to evaluate the impact of this treatment on the overall cost of bladder cancer care. Similarly,
we used Medicare reimbursement rates as a more conservative, lower-bound estimate of the potential savings associated with the use of this intervention among both
Medicare and privately insured patients. Another reason
for using Medicare rates is that the average age of bladder
cancer patients at the time of diagnosis is >70 years.2
Several assumptions were made to identify our sample
population. The first was that the 3-year recurrence rate of
newly resected NMI bladder cancer is 40%. This has been
shown in a variety of follow-up studies of NMI bladder cancer as well as in placebo arms of randomized trials using
BCG.20-26,28,29,31 Thus, in building our model we assumed
that 40% of patients with newly diagnosed and completely
resected low-risk bladder cancer will have recurrence during
the 3-year follow-up period. We also assumed that there
was no stage progression to muscularis propria invading disease. This was an extremely conservative estimate, because
in published series, stage progression has been reported to
Cancer

June 15, 2009

occur in 1% to 20% of patients with low-risk NMI cancer.
The cost of managing invasive bladder cancer is far greater
than for NMI disease, and so failure to consider stage progression biased our cost projections against immediate postTURB instillation therapy. At the time this study was carried out, the AUA had not established immediate intravesical therapy as the standard of care but did recommend it as a
therapeutic option,38 whereas the European Association of
Urology had included it as the standard of care for superficial bladder cancer.39 The recently revised AUA guidelines
have now included it as an ‘‘option’’ (the weakest grade of
guideline with the greatest flexibility in application) for care,
although not as a ‘‘standard’’ or ‘‘recommendation’’.28
The next part of the model dealt with the treatment
of patients with recurrences. Largely based on professional
guidelines by the AUA and the results of randomized clinical trials,20-26,28,29,31 such patients underwent 6 weekly
instillations of BCG with 3 maintenance instillations of
BCG every 6 months for 3 years (although other forms of
intravesical therapy could be used). Again based on published reports,20-26,28,29,31 we assumed that 25% of those
receiving this course would recur and undergo further
instillations with BCG and alpha-interferon. Of those
patients, we assumed that 60% would recur again.36,40 At
this point, the decision would be influenced by the
patient’s comorbidities and wishes and nonstandard treatment by the treating physician; to be very conservative, we
projected that there would not be further recurrences, and
that only frequent cystoscopic monitoring would take
place. This again reduced costs compared with the more
aggressive therapies that would often be selected (eg, cystectomy). Similarly, we modeled the cost if for the first recurrence 6 intravesical instillations of mitomycin C were
used with an assumption that 50% receiving this treatment would recur.24,41 Subsequent recurrences were
treated with BCG or BCG þ alpha-interferon. For both
of these models, we estimated that were they to occur, all
recurrences took place immediately after the index or subsequent TURB. Although this is an oversimplification,
the majority of recurrences take place within 3 to 6
months of the index TURB and over 70% occur within 1
year.28 Because most published trials and series end at the
time of the initial recurrence, few data are available about
the times of second and third recurrences. With longer
intervals between recurrences, expenses would have
changed little, as long as recurrences were treated as they
2667

Original Article

were in the models. In addition, because recurrences took
place at the first cystoscopic evaluation after TURB, it is
likely that standard intravesical therapy would have been
recommended (because of the frequent recurrences),
rather than simple continuation of observational management. By using the above assumptions, we formulated
models for the treatment of a patient with newly diagnosed NMI bladder cancer.
Although cystectomy is sometimes performed for
patients who recur after BCG treatments, this is almost
exclusively reserved for patients with high-grade disease. It
is likely that very few (if any) patients would undergo it
within the first 3 years of being diagnosed with low-grade,
NMI bladder cancer.28 Furthermore, we are unaware of
any data addressing the circumstance (the proportion of
patients with low-risk newly diagnosed bladder cancer
who are treated with BCG, recur after that treatment, and
immediately go on to cystectomy) to guide our model.
Both because such a circumstance is very rare and generally would occur beyond the time horizon of this study, it
is not included in our model. Moreover, to be conservative, we assumed no grade (to high grade) or stage progression (to stage T2) would occur. These occur rarely in the
population being considered.28 If either occurred, cystectomy would be more likely. The huge cost associated with
this procedure, which would be far more likely to occur in
the observed arm, would further bias the results of the
study in favor of immediate post-TURB intravesical therapy. Lastly, we took a conservative estimate of 25% for
the reduction in recurrence rate after immediate postTURB intravesical instillation.37
As with all studies using healthcare databases, several
factors should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, although the sample was drawn from more
than 7 million lives, it may not be representative of the
general population. There are regional biases in medical
and urologic care,37,42 and it is possible that the geographic imbalance in our data may misrepresent what is
occurring in the US as a whole. However, given the only
modest imbalance in geographic distribution, and the
verified utilization of this database for other medical and
oncologic conditions, this likely provides a relatively small
bias, not explaining our results. Furthermore, although
the databases allowed for the analysis of a large sample of
patients across the US, only patients with commercial
health coverage or private Medicare supplemental cover2668

age were analyzed. Finally, these findings are based on retrospective analyses of claims data, and reliance on this
data has limitations. For example, patients may receive
treatment that is not submitted to their health plan for
reimbursement, and thus is not included in claims data,
and a small proportion of claims may be subject to coding
errors. However, we believe our methodology to determine how often immediate post-TURB instillation therapy is used is reliable, because it is administered by
qualified medical personnel (and thus has a CPT code).
Moreover, because errors in billing that lead to problems
in payments rarely go uncorrected, billing data are usually
highly reliable.19
Because we used Medicare reimbursement rates
(which are usually lower than the rates reimbursed by private health plans) to estimate the cost of interventions,
our estimates represent the lower bound of possible savings. However, the effectiveness of the same-day intravesical instillation chemotherapy may also vary depending on
patient risk factors and medical histories. We demonstrated that as long as the intervention is at least 7% to
10% more effective than the TURB alone, post-TURB
single intravesical instillation chemotherapy provides economic savings.
Why is the treatment performed so rarely? One
reason is that although it is considered safe and well tolerated,5-7,11-13 there obviously are some patients with
suspected bladder perforation or post-TURB hematuria
who should not receive it. Another reason is a technical
matter involving dispensing and administering chemotherapy. Many American centers require chemotherapy
nurses and ancillary staff to handle and instill these
agents, preventing most operating or recovery room
nurses from administering them. Currently, some urologists resort to instilling and overseeing the dispensing
and handling themselves. The inconvenience of ordering, instilling, and waiting for the chemotherapy to
dwell for 1-2 hours is, for a busy practitioner, clearly a
deterrent to its use. Another barrier to its acceptance is
the economic burden placed on the hospital. Currently,
the additional expense of using intravesical chemotherapy in a hospital-based setting (eg, operating room) is
borne by the hospital without reimbursement for longer
recovery room time, increased monitoring by specially
trained nursing staff, and the expenses of disposing of
the chemotherapeutic agent.

Treatment of Stage Ta, T1 Bladder Cancer/Madeb et al

Another possible reason for not performing this
treatment may be the way new scientific data are transmitted to and incorporated into practice by physicians.
Although numerous clinical trials have shown its effectiveness, these data have not been widely accepted by US urologists. Whether this is because they are unaware of the
published data or because these trials have largely been
performed outside the US without the participation of
American centers is unclear. American urologists may be
resistant to embracing this approach without validation
by a large American study. The recent revision of AUA
guidelines may have an influence on altering this practice,
but this will not be ascertainable for several years.
Conclusions
Despite generalized acceptance of same-day intravesical
instillation chemotherapy after TURB by urologists outside the US, this policy has not been embraced by American urologists. Reasons for this are unclear. Regardless of
the reasons, we have shown that assuming conservative parameters for efficacy, adopting this policy would considerably lower the cost of caring for bladder cancer in the US.
