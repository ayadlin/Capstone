Abstract
The anticancer properties of cruciferous vegetables are well
known and attributed to an abundance of isothiocyanates such
as benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and phenethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC). While many potential targets of isothiocyanates have
been proposed, a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying their anticancer activity has remained elusive. Here we report
that BITC and PEITC effectively inhibit deubiquitinating enzymes
(DUB), including the enzymes USP9x and UCH37, which are
associated with tumorigenesis, at physiologically relevant concentrations and time scales. USP9x protects the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1 from degradation, and cells dependent on Mcl-1
were especially sensitive to BITC and PEITC. These isothiocyanates increased Mcl-1 ubiquitination and either isothiocyanate
treatment, or RNAi-mediated silencing of USP9x decreased Mcl-1
levels, consistent with the notion that USP9x is a primary target of

isothiocyanate activity. These isothiocyanates also increased ubiquitination of the oncogenic fusion protein Bcr-Abl, resulting in
degradation under low isothiocyanate concentrations and aggregation under high isothiocyanate concentrations. USP9x inhibition paralleled the decrease in Bcr-Abl levels induced by isothiocyanate treatment, and USP9x silencing was sufﬁcient to decrease
Bcr-Abl levels, further suggesting that Bcr-Abl is a USP9x substrate.
Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that USP9x targeting is critical to the
mechanism underpinning the well-established anticancer activity
of isothiocyanate. We propose that the isothiocyanate-induced
inhibition of DUBs may also explain how isothiocyanates affect
inﬂammatory and DNA repair processes, thus offering a unifying
theme in understanding the function and useful application of
isothiocyanates to treat cancer as well as a variety of other
pathologic conditions. Cancer Res; 75(23); 5130–42. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

cell culture and animal models (2, 3), and PEITC has entered
clinical trials for lung and oral cancers (3). Isothiocyanates induce
apoptosis in many cancer cell lines, and exposure to BITC or
PEITC for only 3 hours inhibits cell growth with EC50 values of 1.8
to 17 mmol/L (5). Sulforaphane also inhibits growth under these
conditions, although the values of EC50 are typically much higher
(50 mmol/L). Isothiocyanates perturb many cellular processes,
including DNA repair (3, 6), autophagy (2), the inﬂammatory
response (1), and the antioxidant response (1, 2). Isothiocyanates
also modulate the activity of several oncogenic proteins. For
example, both PEITC and BITC reduce the levels of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 in leukemia cells (7–9), and PEITC induces the
knockdown of Bcr-Abl kinase, the oncogenic fusion protein that
causes chronic myeloid leukemia (10).
The molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer properties of isothiocyanates are under debate (1). Isothiocyanates are
electrophiles that form reversible adducts with small-molecule
thiols such as glutathione (Fig. 1B; ref. 3). Amines can form stable
adducts with isothiocyanates, although this reaction is not facile
at neutral pH. Depletion of glutathione, and resulting generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is an appealing mechanism
for the anticancer activities of isothiocyanates (11). However,
L-butathionine sulfoximine depletes glutathione and induces
ROS to greater extents than PEITC yet does not induce apoptosis
(12). This ﬁnding discredits glutathione depletion/ROS production as the mechanism of anticancer activity. Isothiocyanates can
also modify proteins at thiol and amine residues. At least 30
proteins have been reported to be potential isothiocyanate targets,

The dietary consumption of cabbage, broccoli, and other cruciferous vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of cancer
(1–3). The chemoprotective properties of these vegetables are
attributed to isothiocyanates such as benzyl isothiocyanate
(BITC), phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), and sulforaphane
(Fig. 1A; refs. 1, 2). Plasma concentrations of isothiocyanates can
reach 0.25 mmol/L from a single serving of broccoli, and intracellular concentrations can be 200-fold higher due to concentrative processes (3, 4). Numerous studies demonstrate that these
compounds have antiproliferative activity against tumors in both

including P450s, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase,
mutant p53, migration-inhibitory factor, protein phosphatases,
and tubulin (1), but the functional consequences of isothiocyanate modiﬁcation are usually unknown and the correlation
with cellular phenotypes uncertain. Moreover, the reversible
nature of isothiocyanate–thiol adducts suggests that Cys-modiﬁed proteins were unlikely to be identiﬁed in previous experiments. Therefore, the wide array of potential isothiocyanate
targets does not satisfactorily explain the pleiotropic cellular
effects of isothiocyanates.
Catalytic cysteine residues are generally very nucleophillic and
react readily with electrophiles, so enzymes with catalytic cysteine
residues are good candidates for isothiocyanate targets. Cysteine
proteases are particularly attractive candidates for isothiocyanate
inhibition because the thiol adduct resembles the thioester intermediate of peptide hydrolysis (Fig. 1B and C). The C¼S bond is
longer and more electronegative than C¼O and thus may resemble the transition state for peptide hydrolysis, potentially providing additional binding energy. Isothiocyanates are weak reversible
inhibitors of papain (13), the prototypical cysteine protease from
papaya, but the effects of isothiocyanates on other cysteine
proteases have not been investigated. Papain is distantly related
to deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB), the hydrolases that remove
ubiquitin from target proteins and disassemble ubiquitin chains.
DUBs regulate many important physiologic processes, including
protein degradation, DNA repair, autophagy, and protein trafﬁcking (6, 14) and are potential targets for the treatment of many
diseases, including cancer (15), neurodegeneration, inﬂammation, and infection (14). We recognized that many of the phenotypes associated with dietary isothiocyanates are also observed
when cells are treated with DUB inhibitors. Therefore, we hypothesized that DUBs might be targets of isothiocyanates.
Here, we report that both BITC and PEITC inhibit USP9X and
UCH37 and other DUBs at physiologically relevant concentrations
and time scales. DUB inhibition provides a molecular mechanism
for the anticancer properties of dietary isothiocyanates.

were provided by Dr. Rubio Ren (Brandeis University, Waltham,
MA; obtained in 2012), and COS1 were provided by Dr. Daniel
Oprian (Brandeis University; obtained in 2010). Cell lines were
authenticated (9-Marker STR May 2015). The genetic proﬁles of
K562, MCF-7, HeLa, BaF3, BaF3/p210, and NIH/3T3 cells were
identical to reported genetic proﬁles. COS1 cells were conﬁrmed
to be of African green monkey in origin and free of all interspecies
contamination.
Cells were cultured in DMEM (HeLa, COS1, NIH/3T3, B16F10, and MCF-7) or RPMI (BaF3, BaF3/p210 and K562) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (DBS was used for
NIH/3T3 cells), 1 GlutaMAX, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed atmosphere. BaF3 cells were also
supplemented with 1 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL3 (rmIL3,
R&D Systems).
For lysate preparation, nonadherent cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9),
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 140 mmol/L KCl, 1% NP-40, protease, and
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail II, lysed using 3 freeze thaw cycles,
and clariﬁed by centrifugation. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by
adding 0.1% SDS to the cells together with supernatant followed by
sonication. Protein was analyzed by Western blotting (protein,
antibody dilution): K48-linked ubiquitin (6 mg, 1:9,000 antibody
dilution; 30–40 mg, 1:20,000), PARP (30–40 mg, 1:1,500), K63linked ubiquitin (30–40 mg, 1:1,500), Mcl-1 (30–40 mg, 1:1,000),
FLAG (30–40 mg, 1:6,000), cAbl (30–40 mg, 1:1,000), and ubiquitin
(10–20 mg, 1:14,000). Signals were normalized to actin (1:10,000
for 6 mg lysate; 1:30,000 for 30–40 mg lysate), a-tubulin (1:8,000),
or GAPDH (1:35,000).
UbiquitinG76V-GFP assay
COS1 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for
ubiquitinG76V-GFP (plasmid 11941 from Addgene, from the
laboratory of Nico Dantuma) using Mirus 2020 (Madison, WI).
FACS was carried out on a Beckman FACS Calibur. All data were
analyzed using FlowJo V10, from TreeStar.
20S proteasome assay
Proteasome activity was measured by monitoring the hydrolysis
of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC in 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate,
pH 7.6, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT) at 25 C.
The K0.5 value for human 20S proteasome was experimentally
determined to be 12  2 mmol/L (Hill coefﬁcient ¼ 2), in good
agreement with literature values (17). The apparent K0.5 of proteasome activity of rabbit reticulocyte lysate was 28  3 mmol/L (Hill
coefﬁcient ¼ 1.3).
Activity proﬁling of reactive cysteines
HeLa cell lysates were treated with either DMSO or PEITC
(20 mmol/L), followed by 100 mmol/L of IA-alkyne. Click
chemistry and peptide analysis was performed as described
previously (18, 19).
DUB activity proﬁling
Cell lysate was treated with isothiocyanate or 1% DMSO
control and then treated with HA-UbVS, HA-UbVME, Cy5-UbVME, or TAMRA-Ub-PA. Aliquots were removed and immediately
quenched in 2 DTT loading buffer and frozen until analyzed.

control, harvested, and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cell
pellets were then lysed with glass beads in ice-cold 75 mmol/L
K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 250 mmol/L sucrose.
The clariﬁed supernatant was incubated with Cy5-UbVME (250
nmol/L) for 5 minutes at 37 C. Aliquots were quenched and
treated as above. Western blot analysis was carried out using
standard methods. In-gel ﬂuorescent scans were obtained using a
GE Typhoon scanner.
Recombinant DUB assays
The hydrolysis of Ub-AMC was measured by monitoring the
production of AMC at 37 C in a black 96-well plate. Assay buffer
contained 50 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.75
mmol/L BME. The ﬂuorescence intensities were quantiﬁed with
the appropriate AMC standard curves.
Proliferation assays
Measured using the Alamar Blue Method as described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Immunoprecipitations
For Mcl-1 immunoprecipitations, COS1 cells were transiently
transfected with an expression plasmid for 3 FLAG-tagged
mouse Mcl-1 (Addgene plasmid 32978, from the lab of Joseph
Opferman) using Mirus 2020. 3 Flag–Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads and eluted with
500 mg/mL 3Flag peptide.
For the isolation of polyubiquitinated proteins, BaF3/p210
cells were incubated with 5 mmol/L BITC or PEITC or with 0.1%
DMSO for 1 hour at 37 C. K562 cells were incubated with
5 mmol/L BITC or PEITC or with 0.1% DMSO for 2 hours at
37 C. Poly-K63–linked ubiquitinated proteins were enriched
with RAP80-UIM agarose (25 mL resuspended slurry). For
Bcr-Abl immunoprecipitation, the PEITC-, BITC- (5 mmol/L), or
DMSO-treated cell lysates were adjusted to the same protein
concentration (1 mg/mL) and precleared with protein G (1 hour
at 4 C). The cleared lysate was incubated with anti-cAbl (1 mL/
100 mL lysate) overnight at 4 C. cAbl was immunoprecipitated
with protein G beads.
Cell transfection and RNA interference
BaF3/p210 and K562 cells were transfected with siRNAs using
the Amaxa Nucleofector II (Amaxa). NIH/3T3/p210 cells were
transfected using Dharmafect 1 (GE Dharmacon). Predesigned
ON-TARGET plus siRNA pools (nontargeting and targeting
USP9x) were obtained from Dharmacon. The following siRNA

Naturally Occurring Isothiocyanates Inhibit DUBs

Retroviral transduction
MSCV-p210-IRES-GFP vector obtained from the Ren laboratory (Brandeis University; ref. 20) was used to produce retroviral
pseudovirus. NIH/3T3 cells were transduced with virus GFP–
expressing NIH/3T3 cells collected on a FACS Aria Flow
Cytometer.

Results
Isothiocyanates increase the high-molecular-weight ubiquitin
pool
DUB inhibition can be revealed by the accumulation of highmolecular-weight ubiquitinated proteins (HMW-Ub). Inhibitors

of the proteasome and P97 can also cause the accumulation of
K48-linked ubiquitination, but as yet only DUB inhibitors are
known to cause the accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitination.
We examined the effects of BITC and PEITC on the HMW-Ub in
the pro-B-cell line BaF3/p210, which expresses Bcr-Abl kinase.
Both BITC and PEITC caused the accumulation of K48-linked
HMW-Ub (Fig. 2A and B) while sulforaphane had no effect.
Increases in K48-linked Ub could be observed within 4 hours at
7 mmol/L BITC or PEITC and reached 2- to 4-fold at 15 mmol/L.
Similar results were obtained in BaF3 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). Both isothiocyanates also caused a 9- to 18fold increase in K63-linked Ub (Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S1D). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib

Naturally occurring isothiocyanates cause HMW-Ub accumulation in cells but do not inhibit the proteasome. A, BaF3/p210 cells were treated with PEITC or BITC for
4 hours. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed for K48-linked Ub. Actin is shown as a loading control. Data are representative of two
independent experiments and reproduced independently in the parent BaF3 cell line. B, densitometric quantiﬁcation of the blot shown in A. C, BaF3/p210 cells were

independent experiments and reproduced independently in the parent BaF3 cells. D, quantiﬁcation of immunoblot shown in C. E, BaF3/p210 cells were treated with
BITC (15 mmol/L), BITC (15 mmol/L) combined with bortezomib (20 nmol/L), or bortezomib (20 nmol/L) alone for 4 hours. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. "Control" denotes 0.1% DMSO vehicle only. Actin is shown as a loading control. Data are representative of two independent
G76V
experiments. F, COS1 cells transiently expressing Ub
-GFP were treated for 8 hours with PEITC (12 mmol/L), BITC (12 mmol/L), sulforaphane (SFN; 12 mmol/L),
USP9x inhibitor WP1130 (5 mmol/L), the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Bort, 4 mmol/L), or 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control). GFP was quantiﬁed by ﬂow
cytometry. Data presented are the mean  SD of quadruplicate samples from three independent experiments. Signiﬁcance was determined using the
Student t test.

Lawson et al.

also increased the levels of K48-linked Ub but had no effect on
K63-linked Ub (Fig. 2E). Thus, the accumulation of both K48 and
K63-linked HMW-Ub strongly suggests that BITC and PEITC
inhibit DUBs.
BITC and PEITC do not inhibit the ﬂux through the ubiquitin
proteasome system
The accumulation of K48-linked ubiquitin suggests that the
anticancer effects of Isothiocyanates might arise from inhibition
of ﬂux through the ubiquitin–proteasome system, much like the
anticancer effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Therefore, we used the UbG76V-GFP assay to monitor 26S proteasome
activity and ﬂux through the ubiquitin–proteasome system in live
cells (21, 22). This reporter protein consists of a ubiquitin linked
to the N-terminus of GFP. The G76V mutation prevents the
cleavage of ubiquitin from GFP, leading to its degradation by
the 26S proteasome (22). When COS1 cells expressing UbG76VGFP were treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, GFP
ﬂuorescence increased 1.5-fold, consistent with reports from
other laboratories (e.g., ref. 23; Fig. 2F). In contrast, BITC and
PEITC did not increase GFP levels, indicating that proteasome
activity was not inhibited. Similarly, the DUB inhibitor WP1130
also did not cause an increase in GFP levels (Fig. 2F). Isothiocyanates did not inhibit puriﬁed 20S proteasome or proteasome
activity in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, contrary to a previous report
(Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C; ref. 24). Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the isothiocyanate-induced accumulation of HMW-Ub results from DUB inhibition.
PEITC does not perturb the global cysteine reactome
The methods used to identify isothiocyanate targets in previous
reports were unlikely to detect modiﬁcations of cysteine residues
in DUBs or other proteins. Therefore, we used competitive cysteine
reactivity proﬁling with an iodoacetamide-alkyne (IA-alkyne)
probe (100 mmol/L) to more thoroughly investigate the effects
of isothiocyanates on the global cysteine reactome of HELA cells
(18). More than 1,000 IA-alkyne–labeled cysteine residues were
identiﬁed in HELA cells using mass spectrometric analysis. Unfortunately, only two of these cysteine residues belonged to DUBs
(UCHL1 and otubain 1), alluding to the poor afﬁnity of
IA-alkyne toward the active-site cysteines in DUBs, as well as the
low abundance of DUBs relative to other cysteine-containing
proteins in HELA lysates. Despite low coverage of DUBs, this
cysteine proﬁling experiment provides a measure of the general
promiscuity of PEITC across highly reactive cysteine residues in the
proteome. Treatment of HELA lysates with PEITC (20 mmol/L)
signiﬁcantly inhibited the labeling of only 14 of 1,400 proﬁled
cysteines in at least one of two independent experiments (inhibition  67%; Supplementary Dataset S1), although in no case
was labeling inhibited in both experiments. Seventy of the proﬁled
cysteine residues are found in enzyme active sites or metal-binding
sites, including six dehydrogenases and six cysteine proteases
(Supplementary Dataset S2). PEITC blocked the labeling of only
one of these, mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These experiments demonstrate that
PEITC is not a promiscuous cysteine-modifying agent.
BITC and PEITC inhibit USP9x and UCH37
We turned to competitive activity proﬁling to identify which
DUBs are inhibited by BITC and PEITC. In addition to the

5134 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

commonly used HA-tagged ubiquitin vinyl sulfone (HA-UbVS)
and HA-tagged ubiquitin vinyl methyl ester (HA-UbVME; refs. 25,
26), we also used the more sensitive ﬂuorogenic probes
Cy5-UbVME (26) and TAMRA-ubiquitin propargylamide
(TAMRA-UbPA; refs. 27, 28). These irreversible DUB inhibitors
label 10 to 30 DUBs in cell lysates with varying repertoires
depending on the probe and experimental conditions (25). The
treatment of cell lysates with HA-UbVS produced the characteristic pattern of protein bands at 300, 150 to 100, 45, and 36 kDa,
generally ascribed to USP9x/USP24 (292 kDa), USP19 (146 kDa),
USP7/8 (128 and 127 kDa, respectively), USP28/15 (122 and 112
kDa, respectively), UCH37 (38 kDa), UCH-L3 (26 kDa), and
UCH-L1 (25 kDa; Supplementary Fig. S4A; ref. 25). Similar
results, although with varying band intensities, were obtained
with HA-UbVME, TAMRA-UbPA, and Cy5-UbVME (Supplementary Fig. S4B–S4D). As expected, WP1130 and isopeptidase
inhibitor G5 reduced the labeling of several DUBs (e.g., bands
between 120 and 300 kDa), validating the experimental method
(Supplementary Fig. S4A; refs. 25, 29).
BITC and PEITC inhibited the labeling of several DUBs in
lysates prepared from cells pretreated with isothiocyanates (Fig.
3A). When lysate was incubated with either BITC or PEITC and
then diluted into a buffer containing HA-UbVS, the labeling
increased with time, demonstrating that isothiocyanate inhibition was slowly reversible as expected (Fig. 3B). Labeled DUBs
with molecular weights at 300, 135, and 45 kDa were among the
most susceptible to isothiocyanates. These bands likely corresponded to three DUBs that are potential therapeutic targets for
cancer: USP9x, USP7, and UCH37 (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig.
S4A–S4D). The identities of USP9x and UCH37 were conﬁrmed
by observing the molecular weight shift upon labeling with
immunoblotting (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S4E
and S4F). USP24, a close relative of USP9x (16), was also a target
of BITC and PEITC (Fig. 3E). However, immunoblotting revealed
that the 128-kDa isothiocyanate target was not USP7 (Fig. 3C).
The IC50 values for the inhibition of USP9x labeling were 27 
6 mmol/L and 15  3 mmol/L for BITC and PEITC, respectively, in
cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). The values of IC50

BITC and PEITC inhibit USP9x and UCH37 in vitro
The inhibition of USP9x was conﬁrmed by assaying puriﬁed
recombinant enzyme. PEITC inhibited labeling of recombinant
USP9x with Cy5-UbVME with an IC50 value of 20  2 mmol/L, in
good agreement with the lysate assays (Supplementary Fig. S6A

inhibitors of recombinant USP9x, with values of Ki ¼ 25  1 and

values of kon decreased with increasing substrate concentration,

UCH37 (also known as UCHL5) is a component of the 19S
regulatory particle and the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. The 19S regulatory particle activates UCH37, whereas
UCH37 is inactive in the INO80 complex (30). Therefore, we
assayed the DUB activity of UCH37 in the 19S regulatory particle
using activity proﬁling. Both PEITC and BITC inhibited UCH37
with values of EC50 of 36  5 mmol/L and 31  6 mmol/L, in

USP9x inhibition provides a molecular mechanism for the
antileukemic effects of isothiocyanates

mechanism for the anticancer effects of isothiocyanates (30,
31, 33). USP9x is known to protect the antiapoptotic protein
Mcl-1 from ubiquitination and degradation (33). Intriguingly,
isothiocyanates decrease Mcl-1 levels in several cell lines (7–9),
and similar decreases in Mcl-1 levels are observed when USP9x
is either inhibited or silenced (32–34). These observations
suggest that the USP9x may be a primary target for BITC and
PEITC. In contrast, the role of UCH37 in cancer is not understood and could involve either or both the 19S regulatory

particle and the INO80 complex or recently characterized
complexes with SMAD proteins (30). Which of these complexes
promote cancer, and whether the deubiquitinating activity of
UCH37 is required, is not understood.
If the anticancer effects of BITC and PEITC arise from the
inhibition of USP9x, then Mcl-1–dependent cells should be more
sensitive to isothiocyanates than other cell lines. Therefore, we
tested the isothiocyanate sensitivity of various cell lines (Fig. 4A
and B). BaF3, BaF3/p210, and K562 cells are all dependent on
Mcl-1 (35, 36), and these cells are the most sensitive to BITC and
PEITC, with EC50 values of 1 to 3 mmol/L (Fig. 4A and B). In
contrast, MCF7, NIH3T3, and COS1 cells are 8- to 40-fold less
sensitive to BITC and PEITC, as expected given that these cells do
not rely on Mcl-1. Importantly, MCF7 cells rely on the Mdm2,
which is protected from ubiquitination and degradation by USP7
(14). As shown above, BITC and PEITC do not inhibit USP7,
which explains the resistance of these cells.
USP9x inhibition occurs early in the isothiocyanate anticancer
program
We further examined the effects of isothiocyanates on
BaF3/p210 cells to determine whether the USP9x inhibition is
an initiating event in their anticancer program. USP9x levels
remained stable upon treatment with BITC (Supplementary Fig.
S5F). USP9x inhibition was evident after treatment with either

5136 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

BITC or PEITC for 4 hours (Fig. 4C and D). The values of IC50 for
USP9x inhibition in cells were 4  1 mmol/L and 7  2 mmol/L for
BITC and PEITC, respectively. These values are smaller than those
obtained in lysates (see above). However, cells are known to
concentrate isothiocyanates by factors of hundreds (4), which can
account for this higher potency. Importantly, the inhibition of
USP9x in cells is similar to the inhibition of cell proliferation and
viability.
As in other cell types, Mcl-1 exists as two major bands in
BaF3 cells (37). The fast-mobility (FM) isoform is an Nterminally truncated product formed from the full-length or
slow-mobility (SM) isoform. The fast-mobility isoform has
attenuated antiapoptotic activity as well as a signiﬁcantly longer
half-life (37). A corresponding decrease in total Mcl-1 was also
observed when BaF3/p210 cells were treated with BITC and
PEITC (Fig. 5A–C). In contrast to this isothiocyanate-induced
decrease in Mcl-1, treatment with the proteasome inhibitors
MG-132 and bortezomib increased Mcl-1 levels, as observed by
others (Fig. 5B–D; refs. 38–40). Bortezomib also induced the
appearance of a lower-molecular-weight caspase cleavage Mcl-1
fragment that was not observed with either isothiocyanate (Fig. 5D;
ref. 41). MG-132 rescued Mcl-1 levels in isothiocyanate-treated
cells, as expected if inhibition of USP9x increased ubiquitination
and degradation (Fig. 5B and C). Importantly, BITC also decreased
the levels of Mcl-1 in the presence of the translation inhibitor

increased the levels of ubiquitinated Flag-Mcl-1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. S8).
Bortezomib alone also increased Flag-Mcl-1 ubiquitination, and
the addition of bortezomib further increased ubiquitinated FlagMcl-1 in isothiocyanate-treated cells. These data indicate that the
isothiocyanate-induced decrease in Mcl-1 results from increased
ubiquitination, as expected when USP9x is inhibited. These
observations provide additional evidence that the mechanism of
isothiocyanates is distinct from proteasome inhibition or translation inhibition and suggest that USP9x inhibition can account
for the anticancer activity of isothiocyanates in leukemia cells.
Isothiocyanates increase ubiquitination and degradation of
Bcr-Abl
PEITC has been reported to cause the knockdown of Bcr-Abl
kinase, the oncogenic fusion protein that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (10). Both BaF3/p210 and K562 cells
depend on Bcr-Abl, so the isothiocyanate sensitivity of these
cells could derive from the depletion of Bcr-Abl as well as
Mcl-1. We hypothesized that DUB inhibition could also be
responsible for this isothiocyanate effect. Intriguingly, USP9x
has been implicated in the regulation of Bcr-Abl (34, 42).
Therefore we examined the correlation of Bcr-Abl ubiquitination, PARP cleavage, and USP9x inhibition.
Both BITC and PEITC decreased the levels of total Bcr-Abl in
BaF3/p210 cells (Fig. 6A–C and Supplementary Fig. S9A). Bcr-Abl
knockdown was essentially complete after only 2-hour treatment
with BITC (5 mmol/L), whereas PARP cleavage was not observed
until 6 hours (Fig. 6D). Likewise, Bcr-Abl was reduced to 20%
of its initial level within 2 hours after treatment with PEITC
(5 mmol/L), and PARP cleavage was observed at 4 hours (Fig.
6D). No aggregation of Bcr-Abl kinase was observed at low
isothiocyanate concentrations (5 mmol/L), although aggregation
was evident at high isothiocyanate concentrations (30 mmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S9B–S9D).
Two complimentary approaches were used to determine
whether isothiocyanate treatment increases ubiquitination of
Bcr-Abl. First, Bcr-Abl was immunoprecipitated from lysates of
BaF3/p210 cells. Signiﬁcantly, more ubiquitination was observed
in Bcr-Abl isolated from isothiocyanate-treated cells than untreated cells (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S9E). Bcr-Abl ubiquitination predominantly involves K63 linkages, so we used RAP80UIM–conjugated agarose resin to isolate K63-linked ubiquitinated proteins (34, 43). More polyubiquitinated Bcr-Abl was
recovered from isothiocyanate-treated BaF3/p210 cells than from
untreated cells (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S9F and S9G). A
similar increase in Bcr-Abl ubiquitination was observed when
K562 cells were treated with BITC and PEITC (Supplementary Fig.
S10). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that isothiocyanate treatment increases the ubiquitination and degradation/
aggregation of Bcr-Abl, strongly suggesting that the antileukemia
program of isothiocyanates results from DUB inhibition. Importantly, USP9x inhibition occurred on the same time scale as
Bcr-Abl knockdown at low isothiocyanate concentrations (Fig.
6C and Supplementary Fig. S7E). Thus, USP9x inhibition could be
responsible for the increased ubiquitination of Bcr-Abl.
USP9x knockdown mimics the action of isothiocyanates
To further elucidate the role of USP9x inhibition in the knockdown of Mcl-1 and Bcr-Abl kinase, we used siRNA to decrease the
level of USP9x in K562 cells. Optimal silencing occurred 24 hours

5138 Cancer Res; 75(23) December 1, 2015

posttransfection in these rapidly proliferating cells, resulting in a
70% decrease of USP9x (Fig. 7A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S11A and S11B). The level of Mcl-1 decreased by approximately
30% in the USP9x silenced cells, as reported by others (Fig. 7B;
refs. 33, 34). Bcr-Abl was also reduced by 30% in USP9x silenced
cells. No insoluble Bcr-Abl aggregates were observed (Supplementary Fig. S11C). Mcl-1 and Bcr-Abl were also depleted when
USP9x was silenced in BaF3/p210 cells (Fig. 7C and D and
Supplementary Fig. 11D). Moreover, USP9x silencing resulted in
signiﬁcantly increased cell death in BaF3/p210 cells (Supplementary Fig. S11E), suggesting that the isothiocyanate-induced inhibition of USP9x can, at least partially, account for the reduced
viability and increased cell death observed upon isothiocyanate
treatment. USP9x knockdown sensitizes cells to isothiocyanates,
as expected if USP9x was the primary target (Fig. 7E). However,
electroporated cells appeared to be less sensitive to isothiocyanates (Fig. 7E vs. Supplementary Fig. S11F). We suggest two
explanations for this observation: ﬁrst, electroporation causes
some cell death, which increased background and decreased assay
sensitivity; second, viability was measured after a short isothiocyanate treatment (6 vs. 24 or 48 hours) to keep in the range of
optimal siRNA-induced Bcr-Abl knockdown. Knockdown of BcrAbl was also observed when USP9x expression was silenced in
NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with the Bcr-Abl gene (3T3/p210
cells; Supplementary Fig. S11G). Thus, experiments in three cell
lines, with RNAi targeting USP9x from both human and mouse
cells lines, conﬁrm the role of USP9x in maintaining the levels of
Bcr-Abl.

Discussion
The anticancer effects of BITC and PEITC are well established.
Although isothiocyanates were generally believed to deplete
glutathione, inducing ROS, this mechanism has recently been
discredited (11, 12). We recognized that many of the effects
attributed to isothiocyanates are also properties of DUB inhibitors. Our data demonstrate that BITC and PEITC inhibit at least
two DUBs that are potential anticancer targets, UCH37 and USP9x
(30–32). Moreover, a strong correlation exists between elevated
USP9x levels and poor prognosis (31). While the role of UCH37
in cancer is not well understood, USP9x protects the antiapoptotic/prosurvival protein Mcl-1 from ubiquitination and depletion
(32, 33). Thus, the inhibition of USP9x can account for the
isothiocyanate-induced decrease in Mcl-1. Leukemia cells are
dependent on Mcl-1 and especially sensitive to isothiocyanates.
However, Mcl-1 levels are elevated in many cancers, so the
inhibition of USP9x provides a molecular mechanism for the
broader anticarcinogenic activity of BITC and PEITC.
Isothiocyanates also increase the ubiquitination of Bcr-Abl,
causing depletion via degradation at low concentrations and
aggregation at high concentrations. A partial knockdown of
USP9x also depletes Bcr-Abl. The simplest explanation for this
observation is that Bcr-Abl is a substrate for USP9x, although we
cannot rule out the involvement of other DUBs. The DUB inhibitor WP1130 also increases the ubiquitination and aggregation of
Bcr-Abl, although this work was unable to demonstrate that
USP9x inhibition accounted for these effects (34).
In addition to inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer
cells, isothiocyanates perturb the inﬂammatory response (1) and
DNA repair (3, 6). DUBs also regulate these processes. At least
eight DUBs are involved in inﬂammation (CYLD, A20, Cezanne,

USP21, OTULIN, OTUD5, MCPIP1, and USP9x; refs. 44, 45).
Eight DUBs have also been implicated in DNA repair (OTUB1,
USP1, USP3, USP11, USP16, USP47, BRCC36, and POH1).
Given the multitude of physiologic processes that are regulated
by ubiquitination (6), DUB inhibition is likely to be the
molecular mechanism underlying the pleiotropic effects of
dietary isothiocyanates. It is important to note that our study
focused on just two structurally similar isothiocyanates and two
DUB targets. Other DUB targets remain to be identiﬁed. More
structurally diverse isothiocyanates such as sulphoraphane

could inhibit different cysteine proteases or even other enzymes
with cysteine nucleophiles.
DUBS, like other cysteine proteases, are challenging targets for
drug discovery because potent inhibition usually requires the
presence of electrophillic "warheads" that can react nonspeciﬁcally with other proteins (46). Many DUB inhibitors fall into this
category. For example, G5 (47) and b-AP15 (48) are highly
reactive dienones, which can cause cross-linking. WP1130 (29)
is an activated enone that has off-target effects (49). Only a
handful of selective DUB inhibitors have emerged, including the

USP14-speciﬁc DUB inhibitor IU1, the USP7-speciﬁc inhibitors
P5091 and HBX 19,818, and the USP1 inhibitor ML323 (50). The
reversible nature of isothiocyanate adducts and the relatively low
intrinsic toxicity of this function offer a promising new avenue for
the design of inhibitors for DUBs and other cysteine proteases.
Since more than 120 isothiocyanate are available from both
