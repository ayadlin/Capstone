Abstract
Nrf2 activation promotes resistance to chemical carcinogenesis
in animal models, but activating mutations in Nrf2 also confer
malignant characters to human cells by activating antioxidative/
detoxifying enzymes and metabolic reprogramming. In this study,
we examined how these contradictory activities of Nrf2, cancer
chemoprevention and cancer cell growth enhancement, can be
reconciled in an established mouse model of urethane-induced
lung carcinogenesis. Using Keap1-knockdown (kd) mice, which
express high levels of Nrf2, we found that urethane was rapidly
excreted into the urine, consistent with an upregulation in the
expression of urethane detoxiﬁcation genes. Consequently, urethane-induced tumors were signiﬁcantly smaller and less frequent
in Keap1-kd mice than in wild-type mice. In contrast, tumor cells

derived from Keap1-kd mice and transplanted into nude mice
exhibited higher tumorigenicity compared with cells derived from
wild-type mice. To identify the factors contributing to the tumor
growth phenotype in the transplantation model, we performed a
microarray analysis and found that many antioxidative stress
genes were upregulated in the Keap1-kd–derived tumors. Therefore, we suggest that Nrf2 activation in cancer cells enhances their
tumorigenicity, but global Nrf2 activation, as in Keap1-kd mice,
simultaneously enhances anticancer immunity, thereby suppressing the growth potential of Keap1-kd tumors. Our ﬁndings
provide relevant insight into the dual role of Nrf2 in cancer and
warrant further studies of Nrf2 function during different stages of
carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 76(10); 3088–96. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

reductase (Nqo1), heme oxygenase 1 (Ho-1), and glutamate-cysteine
ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc), are induced. These cytoprotective
enzymes contribute to the cellular protection against oxidative
and electrophilic insults.
Urethane (ethyl carbamate) is a prototypic carcinogen that
induces lung adenoma and adenocarcinoma (3). Upon administration of urethane to mice, adenomas often develop in the lung,
which later give rise to adenocarcinomas (4). Cytochrome P450
2E1 (Cyp2e1)-mediated oxidization converts urethane into
vinyl carbamate epoxide (VCE), which serves as a potent carcinogen by inducing DNA- and protein–adduct formation (5). VCE
is converted into 1, 2-dihydroxyethyl carbamate by microsomal
epoxide hydrolase (mEH), and subsequently the product is subjected to Gstp1/p2–mediated glutathione conjugation. Thereafter, the conjugate is excreted into the urine (6). As the mEH
and Gstp1/p2 genes are targets of NRF2 (1, 7, 8), the detoxiﬁcation pathway of urethane appears to be under the inﬂuence of
Nrf2 activity. Many studies have demonstrated that Nrf2-deﬁcient
mice are susceptible to a variety of carcinogens (9–12). In contrast,
Nrf2 activation in cancer cells has also been shown to contribute
to the promotion of tumor growth in many forms of cancer
(13, 14). These two rather contradictory aspects of Nrf2 function
have been referred to as the "Double-Edged Sword of Nrf2"
(15, 16). We have previously demonstrated that Nrf2 activity
exhibits bidirectional stage-speciﬁc effects in urethane-induced
lung carcinogenesis (17). Speciﬁcally, Nrf2-deﬁcient mice exhibited more abundant microtumor nodules than wild-type mice
at early stages (4–8 weeks) after urethane administration. In
contrast, in the later stages (16 weeks after urethane treatment),
wild-type mice showed large, malignant lung tumors with

The transcription factor Nrf2 plays important roles in the
protective response against environmental stresses, particularly
against oxidative and electrophilic insults (1, 2). In unstressed
conditions, Nrf2 is bound by Keap1 and subjected to degradation
through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Upon exposure to
oxidative or electrophilic stresses, reactive cysteine residues of
Keap1 are chemically modiﬁed. Thereafter, the Keap1-mediated
degradation of Nrf2 is eliminated, leading to Nrf2 accumulation
in the nucleus. Subsequently, Nrf2 dimerizes with one of the small
Maf proteins (sMaf) and binds to the speciﬁc DNA sequence
referred to as antioxidant/electrophile response element, through
which a variety of target genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone oxido-

Genetic Nrf2 Activation in Chemical Lung Carcinogenesis

increased Nrf2 accumulation, whereas Nrf2-deﬁcient mice rarely
developed such malignant cancers (17). These results indicate that
Nrf2 prevents cancer initiation in the early stages, whereas Nrf2
accelerates cancer progression in the advanced stages of urethaneinduced lung carcinogenesis.
Given the above results from the Nrf2-deﬁcient mice, we
next wanted to address whether constitutive Nrf2 activation
affects cancer incidence and malignancy. To this end, we exploited Keap1-knockdown (Keap1-kd) mice that show constitutive
Nrf2 accumulation due to a systemic decrease in Keap1 expression (18). The Keap1-kd mice survive to adulthood and exhibit
resistance against oxidative and electrophilic insults (19, 20).
Therefore, the Keap1-kd mice serve as an excellent model of
genetic Nrf2 induction.
Considering that Nrf2-deﬁcient mice show increased susceptibility to urethane and develop many micronodules in the early
stage (17), we hypothesized that Keap1-kd mice could be resistant against urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis, due to the
constitutive activation of stress-responsive genes. To address this
hypothesis, we utilized the urethane carcinogenesis model in
Keap1-kd mice. We found that the Keap1-kd mice developed a
signiﬁcantly lower number of urethane-induced lung tumors than
the wild-type mice. In contrast, when transplanted into nude mice,
the Keap1-kd mice–derived tumor cells showed more vigorous
growth than the wild-type mice–derived tumor cells. These results
demonstrate that systemic activation of Nrf2 prevents urethaneinduced lung carcinogenesis, whereas Nrf2 activation confers
tumorigenicity on the cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals
Keap1-kd mice (5–9 weeks) and age-matched Keap1-wt mice
with ICR genetic background were used (18, 21). The mice were
maintained in a facility free of speciﬁc pathogens. Nude mice (8–9
weeks) were purchased from CLEA Japan. We mainly used male
mice in this study to exclude gender biases. All animal experiments were performed under the approval of the Tohoku University Animal Care Committee.
Transplantation of tumors into nude mice
Urethane-induced lung tumors of approximately equal sizes
(f ¼ 0.5–1.5 mm) from Keap1-kd and Keap1-wt mice were transplanted subcutaneously into the backs of nude mice. The tumor
diameters were measured each month using a digital caliper. The
tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula:
length (mm)  width (mm)  height (mm)  0.5 (22).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the tissues using ISOGEN
(Nippon Gene). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the
total RNA using random hexamers and Superscript III ReverseTranscriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed
using 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the ABI
PRISM 7300 sequence detector system (PE-Applied Biosystems).
Sequences of primers and TaqMan probes were described previously (17). Following primers were newly prepared; Ppargc1a:
forward ACAGCTTTCTGGGTGGATTG, reverse TCTGTGAGAACCGCTAGCAA. Catalase: forward GCTTCAAGTTGGTTAATGCAG, reverse GGCAATTTTTGATGCCCTGG, and TaqMan probe
AGAGGCAGTCTATTGCAAG.

Urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis experiments
Urethane (ethyl carbamate; 1 g/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally administered. At 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 8 months after
the administration, the mice were euthanized. The lungs were
dissected and the total number of lung surface tumors was
counted macroscopically. The diameter of the tumors was measured using an electronic caliper.
Gene expression analysis
Surface lung tumors were dissected, and surrounding tissues
were carefully removed under a stereoscopic microscope. Tumors and nontumor tissues in lungs of urethane-administered
mouse were pooled and subjected to a whole-mouse genome
microarray analysis (4  44 k; Agilent Technologies). Expression array data were analyzed with GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics). Heatmaps were generated utilizing Cluster 3.0
(http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/) and JAVA
Treeview 159 (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/). The classiﬁcations of the selected genes according to their biologic and
toxicologic functions were performed using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity system). P value, represented
as the negative log ratio of the IPA results, is calculated by the
Fisher exact test.
Statistical analyses
The data are described as the mean  SD. The statistical
signiﬁcance in differences was calculated by the Student t test or
the Mann–Whitney U test. The values for the incidence of
lung tumors were analyzed with the Fisher exact probability
test. P values < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Keap1-kd mice express Nrf2 and its target genes at high levels
Urethane acquires carcinogenic activity through conversion
into the electrophilic metabolite, vinyl carbamate epoxide
(VCE; Fig. 1A). We previously found that intraperitoneal
injection of urethane (1 g/kg body weight) increased Nrf2
protein level and expression of Nrf2 target genes in the lung
of Keap1-wt mice (17). It has previously been shown that
Keap1-kd mice are highly resistant to the damaging effects of
oxidants due to the high expression level of Nrf20 s cytoprotective target genes (19, 20). In this study, we found that a
number of genes that directly participate in the detoxiﬁcation of urethane, that is, Cyp2e1, mEH, Gstp1, and Gstp2, were
induced in the lung of Keap1-kd mice compared with Keap1-wt
mice (Fig. 1B). In the liver, mRNA expression of mEH and
Gstp2 was also higher in Keap1-kd mice when compared with
Keap1-wt mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results indicate
that the expression of urethane detoxiﬁcation genes is enhanced in Keap1-kd mice.
The constitutive activation of the urethane detoxiﬁcation
system in Keap1-kd mice suggests that urethane is efﬁciently
detoxiﬁed in Keap1-kd mice. It has previously been reported
that urethane metabolites are mainly excreted into the urine
(23). Therefore, we examined the concentration of urethane
and its metabolite in plasma and urine of Keap1-kd and Keap1wt mice after intraperitoneal injection of urethane. We collected
plasma and urine samples one day after the injection of
urethane (1 g/kg body weight) and subjected them to LC/
MS-MS analyses. A selected reaction monitoring (SRM)

The urethane level in the plasma was signiﬁcantly
lower in Keap1-kd mice compared with Keap1-wt mice one
day after the urethane injection (Fig. 1E). Similarly, the
level of VCE in the urine was also lower in the Keap1-kd
mice than in the Keap1-wt mice (Fig. 1F). These results
indicate that urethane and its metabolite VCE is efﬁciently
detoxiﬁed and excreted by Keap1-kd mice, presumably by
virtue of the enhanced activity of the urethane detoxiﬁcation pathway.

Keap1-kd mice are resistant against urethane-induced
tumorigenesis
To address the question of whether the susceptibility to urethane is altered in Keap1-kd mice, we applied the urethaneinduced carcinogenesis methodology to the Keap1-kd and
Keap1-wt mice. We analyzed the effects of urethane treatment
under four different experimental conditions: short-term observation (8 weeks), mid-term observation (16 weeks), long-term
observation (8 months), and long-term observation (8 months)
with multiple administrations of urethane.
We found that in the short-term observation after a single
urethane administration, 100.0% (4/4) of the urethane-treated
Keap1-wt mice developed macroscopic (f > 0.5 mm) lung

surface tumors, compared with only 20% (2/10) of the
Keap1-kd mice (f > 0.5 mm; Fig. 2A and B; Table 1A). This
result suggests that the induction of Nrf2 in Keap1-kd mice
prevents urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis during the
early phase.
We extended the observation time and examined the total
number and diameter of lung surface tumors 16 weeks after
urethane administration. The total number of lung surface
tumors (f > 1.0 mm) per mouse was signiﬁcantly increased
during this extended period in the Keap1-wt mice (Fig. 2C and
D; Table 1B). There also exists the possibility that Keap1-kd
tumor cells may grow vigorously during the later stages of the
urethane-induced tumorigenesis, as Nrf2 shows potent oncogenic activity in many types of human cancers (13, 22). To
examine this possibility, we extended the observation term

again and examined the total number and diameter of urethane-induced tumors 8 months after a single administration
of urethane. The total number of surface tumors (f > 1.0 mm)
per mouse was signiﬁcantly increased in the Keap1-wt mice at 8
months (Fig. 3A and B; Table 1C). In contrast, the numbers of
surface tumors did not signiﬁcantly increase in the Keap1-kd
mice even at this late time point (Fig. 3A and B; Table 1C). By
determining the average diameter of all of the tumors in both
genotypes, we found that Keap1-kd mice also developed much
smaller tumors when compared with the Keap1-wt mice
(Fig. 3C). These results indicate that constitutive induction of
Nrf2 through the knockdown of Keap1 expression strongly
restricts the growth of urethane-induced lung tumors.
To examine whether an increased amount of urethane and its
metabolites could increase urethane-mediated tumorigenesis
in Keap1-kd mice, we conducted a tumorigenesis experiment
using multiple injections of urethane. Both Keap1-kd and Keap1wt mice were injected weekly with urethane for four consecutive
weeks, subsequently the mice were examined 8 months after
the ﬁrst urethane administration (Fig. 3D). Surprisingly, the
initiation of tumorigenesis was not dramatically enhanced by
this treatment, and the number of surface tumors was still
signiﬁcantly lower in Keap1-kd mice than in Keap1-wt mice
(Fig. 3E; Table 1D). Interestingly, using this experimental procedure, the diameter of Keap1-kd tumors became similar to that
of Keap1-wt mice (Fig. 3F). In addition, Keap1-kd tumors contained an increased number of Ki67-positive cells compared
with similar sized Keap1-wt tumors (top panels in the Supplementary Fig. S2A), whereas the tumor bearing Keap1-kd lung
tissue harbored a higher number of inﬁltrating inﬂammatory
cells than the Keap1-wt lung (bottom panels in the Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results indicate that the Keap1-kd tumors
have a high tumorigenic potential, but the increased number
of inﬂammatory cells might attenuate the tumor growth in the
Keap1-kd lung tissue.
Cancer-resistant host microenvironment is activated in Keap1kd mice
We previously found that systemic Nrf2 activation in Keap1-kd
mice generates a cancer-resistant host immune environment
by attenuating the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC), a potent cancer immunosurveillance cell type (24).
Intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in MDSCs (ROS-in-MDSC) leads to the suppression of CD8þ
T-cell–mediated cancer immunity, hence the ROS level
serves as a good indicator of MDSCs activity (24, 25). Therefore, we hypothesized that an increase in Nrf2 activity will
decrease the ROS-in-MDSCs level in tumor-bearing Keap1-kd
mice, thereby attenuating the activity of MDSCs, leading to the
generation of a cancer-resistant host immune environment in
Keap1-kd mice.
To test this hypothesis, we conducted tumor cell transplantation studies into immunodeﬁcient nude mice, a gold standard experiment to evaluate the tumorigenicity of cancer cells
without the inﬂuence of host-environment interactions (26).
We dissected lung tumors of approximately equal sizes (f ¼
0.5–1.5 mm) from the Keap1-wt and Keap1-kd mice 8 months
after a single urethane administration, transplanted them into
nude mice, and evaluated their tumorigenicity. Notably, during
the 5-month observation period, tumor cells from Keap1-kd
mice grew much more aggressively than tumor cells from

Keap1-wt mice. Representative tumors taken from the back of
nude mice are shown in Fig. 4A, and the sizes of the tumors
measured every month are depicted in Fig. 4B. These results
indicate that the tumor cells derived from Keap1-kd mice are
more highly proliferative compared with those from the wildtype mice when transplanted into an immunodeﬁcient host
environment.
Expression proﬁle of cancer-related genes in Keap1-kd tumor
cells
To explore the mechanisms underlying the enhanced
growth of Keap1-kd cancer cells in nude mice, we conducted
expression microarray analysis and compared the gene expression proﬁle between Keap1-kd and Keap1-wt tumor cells. For
this purpose, we extracted total RNA from tumors and noncancerous normal tissue from both Keap1-kd and Keap1-wt
mice 8 months after a single administration of urethane. We
selected genes that were induced more than 2-fold in the
tumors relative to normal lung tissue in both genotypes of
mice and subjected the expression array data to IPA to identify
enriched gene ontology terms. From this analysis, the gene set
annotated as "cancer-related genes" was identiﬁed and separated into three groups depending on whether they were
commonly or differentially expressed between Keap1-kd and
Keap1-wt tumors (depicted in the Venn diagram; Fig. 5A). A set
of 566 genes were found to be commonly upregulated in both
the Keap1-kd and Keap1-wt cancer tissues, including genes that
regulate lung development, such as Sox9, Id2, and Foxa2 (data
not shown). These three genes have previously been shown to
participate in lung cancer progression under the regulation of
Nrf2 (17).

3092 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

A distinct set of 489 genes was exclusively upregulated in
the Keap1-kd tumors. Employing IPA analysis, we identiﬁed
20 downstream genes responsible for the enhanced growth
of Keap1-kd tumors and conﬁrmed their differential expression patterns between the Keap1-wt and the Keap1-kd tumors
(Fig. 5B). Most of the genes encode antioxidant and detoxiﬁcation enzymes, which are well-known downstream target
genes of Nrf2 (Supplementary Table S1; refs. 27–31). Of the
20 genes, Glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2), Catalase (Cat),
Ppargc1A, Glutathione-S-transferase a4 (Gsta4), and Glutathione
reductase (Gsr) were found to be highly expressed in the Keap1kd cancers in comparison with the Keap1-wt cancers (pink dots
in Fig. 5B), and all ﬁve of these genes have been reported to
contribute to cancer cell proliferation through eliminating
cellular ROS level (32–35). We conﬁrmed this change in gene
expression by means of manual quantitative RT-PCR (Fig.
5C). In addition, we noticed an increase in Multidrug resistance
protein 3 (Mrp3) expression, which contributes to cellular
multidrug resistance (36). These results suggest that the
Keap1-kd cancer cells retain higher level of drug resistance
than do the Keap1-wt cancer cells.
However, it should be noted that the tumors in Keap1-kd
mice were all small, and that the cancer cells from the
Keap1-kd mice only proliferated vigorously in the microenvironment of the nude mouse. Therefore, these results
demonstrate that, although increased expression of antioxidant genes contributes to the enhanced proliferation of
Keap1-kd cancer cells, the proliferation of these tumors is
severely repressed by the anticancer immunity mediated by
the global increase in Nrf2 activity in Keap1-kd mice (summarized in Fig. 6).

Discussion
It is widely accepted that Nrf2 attenuates toxicities of many
oncogenic compounds by inducing the expression of a series of
detoxifying and antioxidative stress enzyme genes (1). For
example, urethane treatment induces Nrf2 accumulation, and
the subsequent induction of detoxifying and antioxidative
stress enzymes alleviates the initiation of lung cancers in
wild-type mice (17). In this study, we have demonstrated that
Keap1-kd mice, which express cytoprotective enzymes at a high
level, are signiﬁcantly resistant to urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis, indicating that the cytoprotective enzymes regulated by Nrf2 are crucial for the prevention of urethane-induced
carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, while the number and size of
urethane-induced tumors was signiﬁcantly decreased in the
Keap1-kd mice, tumor cells derived from the Keap1-kd mice
grew much more vigorously upon transplantation into nude
mice than the wild-type mouse–derived cancer cells. These
results demonstrate that, while the Keap1-kd mouse–derived
cancer cells acquire a strong cue for malignant transformation,
their proliferation ability is severely repressed by the anticancer
immunity mediated by the global increase in Nrf2 activity in

consequently a reduction in both tumor number and size in
response to urethane-induced carcinogenesis (summarized
in Fig. 6).
To clarify the mechanisms underlying the strong proliferative
activity of the transplanted Keap1-kd cells, we examined the gene
expression signature of the Keap1-kd tumors. Our microarray
analysis revealed that a battery of Nrf2 downstream genes is
highly expressed in the Keap1-kd tumors. Particularly, expressions
of Gpx2, Gsr, Cat, Mrp3, Gsta2, and Ppargc1A genes, all of which
have been reported to be regulated by Nrf2, are increased (27–31,
36, 40, 41). Of these antioxidant proteins, Catalase encoded by
Cat is known to play a crucial role in the ROS-scavenging system
by converting hydrogen peroxide to water (31). A recent study
revealed the contribution of Catalase to the enhancement of lung
cancer malignancy by reducing ROS level (32). PPAR gamma
coactivator-1a (Pgc1a), a transcriptional coactivator encoded by
Ppargc1A, also plays important roles in cellular protection against
ROS by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes (27). In
addition, Pgc1a has also been shown to be highly expressed in
several types of epithelial cancer where it contributes to ROS
scavenging (34). Given these previous reports, our current results
indicate that constitutively activated Nrf2 in the Keap1-kd tumor
cells contributes to malignant progression by reducing ROS levels
through inducing the expression of multiple antioxidant genes.
Similarly, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with antioxidants,
such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E, have been shown
to reduce intracellular ROS levels and promote cancer progression

Keap1-kd mice. Consequently, the size of the tumors is kept
small in the Keap1-kd mice.
It has been shown that the immunosuppressive activity by
MDSCs is primarily regulated by the intracellular ROS level
(37) and that the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant system appears to
play a crucial role for the reduction of immunosuppressive
activity in MDSCs (24, 38). Recently, ex vivo experiment of
bone marrow–derived macrophage using Nrf2-deﬁcient mice
showed that Nrf2 contributes to CD8þ T-cell function by
regulating g-GCS and xCT (39). We recently reported that the
immune microenvironment of Keap1-kd mice leads to resistance against metastasis of lung cancer cells and that activation
of Nrf2 by chemical inducers reduces ROS levels in MDSCs,
which in turn strengthens host immunity against metastatic
cancer cells (38). We found that when Keap1-kd tumors were
transplanted into T-cell–deﬁcient nude mice, they proliferated
vigorously, supporting the notion that Nrf2-mediated
enhancement of anticancer immunity is critically important
to regulate the cancer-resistant host microenvironment. We
would postulate that, the genetic induction of Nrf2 by knockdown of the Keap1 gene results in reduced MDSCs activity, and

Figure 6.
High-level Nrf2 expression in the Keap1-kd lung cancer cells enhances the
tumorigenicity through activating antioxidative stress system. Meanwhile,
increased level of Nrf2 intensiﬁes carcinogen detoxifying system and
anticancer immunity in the host environment (depicted in the "Host
Defense"). Balance between these two aspects of Nrf2 function is a critical
determinant for tumor growth. In the Keap1-kd mice, the tumor-resistant
environment dominates the tumorigenicity of the cells, thereby diminishing
tumor growth.

Genetic Nrf2 Activation in Chemical Lung Carcinogenesis

in experimental carcinogenesis in multiple tissues (42). These
wide-ranging observations suggest that antioxidants may exert
accelerating effects on cancer progression at the late stages of
carcinogenesis.
Constitutive activation of Nrf2 in Keap1-kd mice produces
the same positive effect on the proliferation of tumor cells,
but as Nrf2 concomitantly activates anticancer immunity, it
does not promote unrestricted tumor growth. Thus, our
results show that the systemic activation of Nrf2 prior to the
administration of carcinogens prevents urethane-induced
lung carcinogenesis.
