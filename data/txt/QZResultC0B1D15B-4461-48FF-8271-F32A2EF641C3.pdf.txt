Abstract

Author Manuscript

Characterization of the prostate cancer transcriptome and genome has identified chromosomal
rearrangements and copy number gains/losses, including ETS gene fusions, PTEN loss and
androgen receptor (AR) amplification, that drive prostate cancer development and progression to
lethal, metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)1. As less is known about the role of
mutations2–4, here we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal, heavily-pretreated metastatic CRPCs
obtained at rapid autopsy (including three different foci from the same patient) and 11 treatment
naïve, high-grade localized prostate cancers. We identified low overall mutation rates even in
heavily treated CRPC (2.00/Mb) and confirmed the monoclonal origin of lethal CRPC. Integrating
exome copy number analysis identified disruptions of CHD1, which define a subtype of ETS
fusionnegative prostate cancer. Similarly, we demonstrate that ETS2, which is deleted in ~1/3 of
CRPCs (commonly through TMPRSS2:ERG fusions), is also deregulated through mutation.
Further, we identified recurrent mutations in multiple chromatin/histone modifying genes,
including MLL2 (mutated in 8.6% of prostate cancers), and demonstrate interaction of the MLL
complex with AR, which is required for AR-mediated signaling. We also identified novel
recurrent mutations in the AR collaborating factor FOXA1, which is mutated in 5 of 147 (3.4%)
prostate cancers (both untreated localized prostate cancer and CRPC), and showed that mutated
FOXA1 represses androgen signaling and increases tumour growth. Proteins that physically
interact with AR, such as the ERG gene fusion product, FOXA1, MLL2, UTX, and ASXL1 were
found to be mutated in CRPC. In summary, we describe the mutational landscape of a heavily
treated metastatic cancer, identify novel mechanisms of AR signaling deregulated in prostate
cancer, and prioritize candidates for future study.

Author Manuscript

Although localized prostate cancer is highly curable, more than 32,000 U.S. men die
annually of metastatic disease. Androgen-deprivation therapy results in rapid responses in
men with metastatic prostate cancer, however nearly all patients eventually progress
(castrate resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]). Although CRPC was thought to be androgen
signaling independent, recent evidence demonstrates that androgen signaling is often
maintained through varied mechanisms (reviewed in1,5). Gene expression and copy number
profiling studies have identified recurrent gene fusions, chromosomal gains and losses, and
deregulated pathways in prostate cancer 1. Resequencing studies have characterized the
mutational spectrum of prostate cancer3,4,6, and the genomes of seven localized prostate
cancers have been reported by Berger et al. 7. More recently, Kumar et al. reported the
exomes of xenografts from 16 CRPC cases2.

Author Manuscript

Here, we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal heavily pretreated CRPCs (WA2-60) obtained
at rapid autopsy8, including three distinct sites in the same patient, and eleven treatment
naïve, high-grade localized prostate cancers (T1-T97) (Supplementary Table 1). Sequencing
results, including coverage statistics, mutation rates, validation rates, mutational spectrum,
confirmation of the monoclonal origin of CRPC, and overlap with mutations observed in
previous studies are provided in the Supplementary Results, Supplementary Figures 1–6 &
Tables 2–6.

We used exome sequencing data to identify somatic copy number alterations 9 (see Methods
and Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Tables 7–9), and as shown in Supplementary
Fig. 8 we identified recurrent aberrations previously associated with prostate cancer
development and progression (Supplementary Results). We additionally performed array
CGH (aCGH) copy number and gene expression profiling on a matched cohort of benign
prostate tissues, localized prostate cancers (3/59 sequenced) and 35 CRPCs (31/35
sequenced) (Supplementary Table 10). Profiles were uploaded into Oncomine
(www.oncomine.com) for automated data processing, analysis and visualization, and are
available for exploration. aCGH profiles were similar to copy number analysis by exome
sequencing and to other prostate cancer profiling studies available in Oncomine
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Global gene expression profiles were similar to previous studies
(analyses available in Oncomine), with exceptions described in the Supplementary Results
and Supplementary Fig. 10. Finally, we performed transcriptome sequencing of 11 prostate
cancer cell lines to identify likely somatic variants (see Supplementary Results, Methods and
Tables 11–15).

Author Manuscript

From our exome data, we identified nine genes that were significantly mutated (false
discovery rate ≤ 0.10) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 16&4), six of which have been
reported as recurrently mutated in prostate cancer: TP53, AR, ZFHX3, RB1, PTEN and APC.
Three significantly mutated genes do not have described roles in prostate cancer: MLL2,
OR5L1 and CDK12. MLL2 encodes a H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase that is
recurrently mutated in multiple cancers and CDK12 was recently identified as significantly
mutated in ovarian serous carcinoma10. Additionally, using several approaches, we
identified multiple significantly mutated pathways, including WNT signaling, and a PTEN
interaction network (Supplementary Figure 11 & Tables 17&18); observations on
significantly mutated genes and pathways are provided in the Supplementary Results.
Multiple candidate driver mutations in genes associated with AR signaling, DNA damage
response, histone/chromatin modification, the spindle checkpoint, and classical tumour
suppressors and oncogenes were also identified (Fig. 1). For example, we identified two
deleterious mutations in PRKDC (I1137fs and E640*), which encodes the catalytic subunit
of the DNA-dependent protein kinase involved in DNA double strand break repair and
recombination, in patient T96, who had an extremely aggressive localized prostate cancer.
Additional mutated genes in these pathways are described in the Supplementary Results.

Author Manuscript

To identify potential CRPC drivers, we considered genes with recurrent high-level gains or
losses present in peaks of global copy number change, and compared results to mutated
genes (Supplementary Fig. 12), as described in the Supplementary Results. Thus, we were
intrigued by the peak of copy number loss on chr 5q21 (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig. 12)
harboring CHD1, which encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme reported
as deregulated in 3 of 7 prostate cancer genomes by Berger et al. (one somatic splice-site
mutation and two rearrangements)7. As described in the Supplementary Results & Figure
13, across our exome and aCGH copy number analysis, we identified focal deletion/
mutation of CHD1 (CHD1−) in 10/119 (8%) prostate cancers, which was significantly
associated with ETS gene fusion negative (ETS−)status (two sided Fisher’s exact test,

p=0.02). Association of CHD1 gene expression and genomic CHD1− status is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 13b.
We next analyzed the association between CHD1− and ETS status in three prostate cancer
aCGH and nine expression profiling studies (totaling 835 additional cancers) using
Oncomine (Supplementary Results). As shown in Supplementary Figure 14 and Table 19
and Figure 2b, in total, across 13 DNA and RNA based studies, we identified 50 of 954
(5.2%) prostate cancers as CHD1−, 48 of which (96%) were ETS− (p<0.0001, two sided
Fisher’s exact test). Together, our integrated analysis identifies CHD1−/ ETS− as a novel
prostate cancer subtype.

ETS genes have a central role in prostate cancer, most commonly through fusion to
androgen driven genes (i.e. TMPRSS2:ERG), and as the majority of ETS gene fusion
positive (ETS+) CRPCs retained marked over-expression of the rearranged ETS gene (ERG,
ETV1 or ETV5), our results support active androgen signaling in the majority of these men
(Supplementary Fig. 13b). We next further explored the role of ETS genes in prostate cancer
by evaluating our dataset for aberrations in additional ETS genes. Importantly, two CRPCs
harbored deleterious mutations in ETV3, (P327fs in WA56 and W38* in WA26, both ETS+),
which does not have a described role in prostate cancer. In addition, we were intrigued by
the mutation of ETS2 (R437C) in WA30 (ETS−), as ETS2 shows a similar DNA binding
motif as ERG11 and is located immediately telomeric to ERG (head-to-head orientation) in
the commonly deleted region in TMPRSS2:ERG fusions through deletion. We also identified
focal deletions extending telomeric from ERG in ERG+ cancers, as well as focal deletion of
ETS2 in WA31, which shows outlier under-expression of ETS2 (Supplementary Results, &
Fig 15). Additionally, the R437C mutation in ETS2 occurs in the ETS domain at a DNA
contacting residue conserved in class I ETS transcription factors11, which include all ETS
genes known to be involved in gene fusions in prostate cancer (Fig. 2c). Given observations
that prostate cancers with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions through deletion may be more aggressive
than those with fusions through insertion, we and others have speculated that the intervening
region may harbor tumour suppressors, including ETS212–14. As shown in Fig 2d, we
demonstrate that over-expression of wild type ETS2 results in decreased migration, invasion
and proliferation in VCaP cells, while the R437C mutation has opposite effects, supporting a
potential tumour suppressive role for ETS2.

In addition to MLL2 and CHD1, our integrated analysis identified mutations and copy
number aberrations in multiple other genes involved in chromatin/histone modification (Fig.
1), including multiple members of the MLL complex (see Supplementary Results and Fig 3).
Besides CHD1, which shows deregulation in both localized prostate cancer and CRPC (Fig.
2 and Supplementary Figs. 13&14), mutations of other chromatin/histone remodeling genes
were infrequent in localized prostate cancer and concentrated in a single sample (T97, Fig.
1). Hence, we hypothesized that the mutated chromatin/histone remodelers we identified
may mediate AR signaling through interaction. Thus, we immunoprecipitated endogenous
AR from VCaP cells (ERG+ CRPC, active AR signaling) and blotted for members of the
MLL complex (MLL2, MLL, ASH2L), UTX, ASXL1 and CHD1. FOXA1, a known direct
interacting AR cofactor15, and EZH2 (a H3K27 histone methyltransferase over-expressed in
CRPC), were evaluated as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Figure
Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 January 12.

3a, members of the MLL complex, UTX and ASXL1 all interact with AR, while interaction
with CHD1 was not observed. Reverse immunoprecipitation confirmed interactions between
AR and MLL, MLL2, ASH2L and FOXA1 (Supplementary Fig. S16a).
As the MLL complex is implicated in epigenetic transcriptional activation, we studied its
role in AR signaling. RNA interference of MLL or ASH2L using independent siRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. 16b) significantly inhibited AR signaling, as assessed by inhibition of
R1881 (synthetic androgen) stimulation of KLK3 (PSA) expression, with two siRNAs each
against MLL or ASH2L inhibiting KLK3 expression at 24 hours by > 7.5 fold (each p<0.001)
(Fig. 3b). Together, our data suggest that aberrations in AR and interacting proteins,
including chromatin/histone remodelers, ETS genes (exemplified by ERG, which directly
interacts with AR16) and known AR co-regulators including FOXA1 (see below), are
common in CRPC (Fig. 3c).

Given the central role of AR signaling in CRPC and the selection for aberrations in AR
occurring in CRPC, we were intrigued by the identification of a somatic 2 bp insertion in
FOXA1 (S453fs) in the localized prostate cancer sample T12, and 340fs and P358fs indels in
DU-145 and LAPC-4 (identified by transcriptome sequencing), respectively, given the well
described role of FOXA1 in AR signaling17–22. Thus, we screened 101 localized and 46
CRPCs (including foci from all exome sequenced CRPCs), and identified somatic mutations
of FOXA1 in 4 localized prostate cancers and 1 CRPC (total 5 of 147, 3.4%). Importantly, 4
of the 5 mutations, as well as both indels identified in the transcriptome screen, occurred in
the C-terminal transactivating domain (Fig. 4a). As described in the Supplementary Results,
we demonstrate that stable expression in LNCaP cells of either wild type FOXA1 or
observed FOXA1 mutants increase proliferation in the presence of androgen (Fig 4b&c),
represses the AR transcriptional program (Fig. 4d), and result in increased soft agar colony
(Supplementary Fig 17) and xenograft growth (Fig 4e).
Our integrated, exome-based profiling of the mutational landscape of CRPC is notable for
representing a large cohort of heavily pre-treated patients with lethal metastatic disease,
which are not commonly studied, and provides insights into the resistance mechanisms that
evolve in refractory tumours. Additionally, we identified a diverse series of potentially
driving mutations and copy number alterations in both known and novel genes and
pathways, including FOXA1. Lastly, our integrative genomics dataset provides a useful
resource for the study of lethal prostate cancer, as well as determinants of, or resistance
mechanisms to, radiation and chemotherapy.

a. Exome sequencing and subsequent screening of 147 prostate cancers (101 treatment naïve
localized and 46 CRPCs) identified 5 samples with FOXA1 mutations, and transcriptome
sequencing of 11 prostate cancer cell lines identified indels in LAPC-4 and DU-145 (shown
in black). Locations of mutations are indicated on the domain structure of FOXA1 (TA=
transactivation domains). b. Wild type FOXA1 (wt, black) and FOXA1 mutants observed in
clinical samples were stably expressed in LNCaP cells as N-terminal FLAG fusions (empty
vector, purple, as control). Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody confirmed expression.
c. Cell proliferation in 1% charcoal-dextran stripped serum with 10 nM DHT was measured
by WST-1 colorimetric assay. Mean + S.E. (n=4) is plotted. d. FOXA1 wild-type and
mutations identified in prostate cancer repress androgen signaling. Indicated LNCaP cells
were treated with vehicle or 10 nM DHT for 48 hrs prior to expression profiling. The
heatmap shows probes with >2 fold change after DHT stimulation in LNCaP vector DHT/
vehicle cells. Probes were clustered using centroid linkage. For each FOXA1 mutant (or
wild-type) DHT/vehicle condition, the percentage of filtered probes showing <1.5 or >-1.5
fold change (indicating repression) is indicated. e. Subcutaneous xenografts were generated
from LNCaP cells stably expressing LACZ (control, purple), or N-terminally HA-tagged
FOXA1 (wild type [wt] or S453fs). Tumour volume is plotted and representative tumours
are shown. Mean + S.E. (n=3) is plotted; * indicates p < 0.05 from two tailed t-test.
