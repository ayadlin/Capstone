ABSTRACT
Recent studies have implied that miRNAs may play a crucial role in tumor
progression and may be involved in the modulation of some drug resistance in cancer
cells. Earlier studies have demonstrated that miR-194 was involved in tumor metastasis
and drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas their expression
and roles on NSCLC still need further elucidation. In the current study, we found that
miR-194 is decreased in NSCLC samples compared with adjacent non-cancerous lung
samples, and low expression of miR-194 predicts poor patient survival. Both in vitro
and in vivo experiments showed that ectopic stable expression miR-194 suppressed
proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells
and that this suppression could be reversed by reintroducing forkhead box A1 (FOXA1),
a functional target of miR-194. In addition, miR-194 was downregulated in in cisplatinresisted human NSCLC cell line-A549/DDP and overexpression of miR-194 increases
cisplatin sensitivity. These findings suggested that miR-194 inhibits proliferation and
metastasis and reverses cisplatin-resistance of NSCLC cells and may be useful as a new
potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

They play a key role in many biological processes through
negative regulation of the expression of target genes posttranscriptionally by sequence-specific binding to the
3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of specific mRNA targets [3].
MiR-194 is a vertebrate specific microRNA with
a known role in mitochondrial energy production [4],
inhibition of inflammation [5], chondrogenesis [6] and
neuronal differentiation [7]. It has also been implicated in
a number of malignancies, including oral squamous cell
carcinoma [8], breast cancer [9, 10] and so on. Another
study showed that miR-194, via its actions on the protein
FOXM1, inhibits gastric carcinoma cell migration,
invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition [11].
In oral squamous cell carcinoma, miR-194 appears to
medicate PI3K-Akt-FOXO3a signaling pathway via its
negative regulation of AGK [8]. A recent study reported
that miR-194 was decreased and associated with tumor
size and tumor differentiation in colorectal cancer,

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one
of the most common cancers and one of the leading
causes of cancer related mortality across the world [1].
Most common pulmonary malignancy are NSCLC, it
accounts for 85% of cases of pulmonary malignancies
[2]. The most effective treatment for NSCLC is surgical
resection, but most of patients diagnosed with NSCLC
have reached an advanced pathological stage, at which
point the patients miss the best time for surgical resection.
Despite significant advances in surgery, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer was
only 15%. Therefore, new treatment strategies to identify
new molecular targets for prevention and treatment of
NSCLC are urgently needed.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of single-stranded
noncoding RNA molecules of 18–24 nucleotides in length.

overexpression of miR-194 suppresses tumor growth by
regulating the MAP4K4/c-Jun/MDM2 signaling pathway.
MiR-194, commonly repressed in colorectal cancer,
suppresses tumor growth by regulating the MAP4K4/cJun/MDM2 signaling pathway. Moreover, miR-194
was found to reduce in primary tumor samples with
metastasis and enforcing miR-194 suppressed motility
and invasiveness of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
through downregulation of two key functional factors,
BMP1 and p27kip1. miR-194 suppresses metastasis of
non-small cell lung cancer through regulating expression
of BMP1 and p27kip1. However, the roles of miR-194
in NSCLC growth and metastasis and the molecular
mechanism remain to be investigated.
FOXA1 is a member of the human Forkhead-box
family. These genes have been implicated in congenital
disorders, diabetes, and carcinogenesis [12]. In squamous
cell carcinoma of the lung, FOXA1 expression has been
shown to be associated with distant metastases and poorer
overall survival [13]. It has also been shown to promote
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC,
perhaps explaining its association with the propensity to
metastasize in NSCLC cells [14]. More recently, FOXA1
was found to upregulate and high FOXA1 expression
have lower rates of progression free survival in Urothelial
carcinoma of the bladder. MicroRNA-99a and 100
mediated upregulation of FOXA1 in bladder cancer.
In this study, we first determined the miR-194
expression in NSCLC tissues and their corresponding
adjacent normal tissues, then investigated the functional role
of miR-194 in tumourigenesis, metastasis, and apoptosis
induction in NSCLC cells. We also provide experimental
evidence that miR-194 regulated cellular function via
directly interacting with the FOXA1 mRNA at the 3′-UTR.
In all, our data supports the notion that miR-194 acts as a
tumor suppressor and might be a novel potential therapeutic
target for NSCLC.

Lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P <  0.05). Overall
survival was examined in patients with NSCLC’s expressing
varying amounts of miR-194. 29 patients had tumors that
expressed high levels of miR-194, while 35 patients had
tumors that expressed low levels of miR-194. Patients
with tumors that expressed high levels of miR-194 had
significantly longer overall survival than patients who had
tumors that expressed low levels of miR-194 (p = 0.0002)
(Figure 1C). Finally, expression levels of miR-194 were
determined in six NSCLC cell lines, with the benign human
bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) serving as a control.
Expression levels of miR-194 were significantly less in all
of the NSCLC cell lines compared to the control (p < 0.01)
(Figure 1D), especially, NCI-H1299 and A549 cells showed
lowest miR-194 levels. Overall, these results indicated that
not only does decreased expression of miR-194 distinguish
benign tissue from malignant NSCLC but also that the
magnitude of the decrease in expression in tumor tissue can
characterize the aggressiveness of the tumor.

miR-194 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation both
in vitro and in vivo
With the knowledge that lower level of miR-194
is associated with more aggressive NSCLC behavior,
we then attempted to determine what factors contribute
to the increase in aggressiveness of these tumors. We
therefore examined effect of miR-194 on cell proliferation.
Transfection of the H1299 and A549 NSCLC cell lines
with either a miR-194 vector or an empty control vector
was performed. Increased expression of miR-194 in the
cells transfected with the miR-194 vector was confirmed
by qRT-PCR in both cell lines (p < 0.01) (Figure 2A). The
MTT assay was then performed on cells from both lines
to assess cell viability. Both H1299 and A549 cells that
were transfected with the miR-194 vector demonstrated
significantly reduced cell viability compared to H1299
and A549 cells transfected with the control vector
respectively after three days (p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). The
colony formation assay was also performed to assess
proliferative capacity. Again, both H1299 and A549 cells
that were transfected with the miR-194 vector exhibited
significantly lower rates of colony formation than H1299
and A549 cells transfected with the control vector
respectively (p  < 0.01). Representative micrographs of
this assay are also provided (Figure 2C). Finally, in vivo
analysis of tumor growth was assessed by measuring both
tumor volume and weight. A549 cells that were transfected
with the miR-194 vector and implanted into nude mice
grew into both significantly smaller (p < 0.01) (Figure 2E)
and lighter (p < 0.01) (Figure 2F) tumors than A549 cells
that were transfected with the empty control vector and
implanted into nude mice. Gross specimens dissected
from the mice pictorially demonstrate this difference in
volume (Figure 2D). Overall, these results suggested that
miR- 194 has an inhibitory effect on tumor aggressiveness
by reducing cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
miR-194 was significantly downregulated and
correlated with poor prognosis
Expression levels of miR-194 were determined in
64 pairs of NSCLC tissue and paired adjacent non-tumor
tissue. Expression of miR-194 in NSCLC tumor tissue
was significantly lower than in the paired non-tumor tissue
(p < 0.01) (Figure 1A). Expression of miR-194 was also
examined in NSCLC tissues of varying stage. In higher stage
lesions (stage III–IV), miR-194 expression was significantly
lower than in lower stage lesions (stage I–II) (p = 0.0004)
(Figure 1B). Furthermore, we investigated the potential
associations between miR-194 expression and patients’
clinicopathological variables. Clinicopathological variables
of NSCLC patients were shown in Table 1. Interestingly,
low miR-194 expression was significantly correlated with

miR-194 arrests the cell cycle and induces
apoptosis in NSCLC cells

Finally, expression levels of specific proteins
known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis were
determined by Western blot. Both H1299 and A549 cells
that were transfected with the miR-194 vector expressed
greater levels of Bax and lower levels of BCL-2 and
CyclinD1 than H1299 and A549 cells transfected with
the control vector respectively (Figure 3C). As Bax is
a protein necessary for the initiation of apoptosis, its
increased expression in cells treated with the miR- 194
vector confirms the association between miR-194
expression and apoptosis. Conversely, as BCL-2 inhibits
apoptosis and Cyclin D1 promotes progression through the
cell cycle, their reduced expression in cells treated with
miR-194 vector also confirm the association between miR194 expression and apoptosis.

The reduction in cell proliferation seen in NSCLC
cells treated with miR-194 was then further examined by
looking at its effect on apoptosis and the cell cycle. The
FITC and PI apoptosis assays were used to determine rates
of apoptosis in the various cells. Both H1299 and A549 cells
that were transfected with the miR-194 vector exhibited
significantly increased rates of apoptosis compared to
H1299 and A549 cells transfected with the control vector
respectively (p < 0.01) (Figure 3A). A cell cycle assay was
subsequently performed to determine the percent of cells in
each phase of the cell cycle. A significantly lower percent
of both H1299 and A549 cells transfected with the miR194 vector were in S phase than H1299 and A549 cells
transfected with the control vector respectively (p < 0.01)
(Figure 3B). Conversely, a significantly higher percent of
both H1299 and A549 cells transfected with the miR- 194
vector were in G2 phase than H1299 and A549 cells
transfected with the control vector respectively (p < 0.01)
(Figure 3B). These findings suggested that miR-194 reduces
cellular proliferation in NSCLC tissue both by increasing
apoptosis as well as by inhibiting cellular mitosis.

miR-194 inhibits NSCLC migration and invasion
both in vitro and in vivo
Cell proliferation is an important measure of tumor
aggressiveness, though it is an incomplete measure. A
tumor’s ability to metastasize is a vital component of
its aggressiveness and is directly related to its migratory
and invasive capacity. Therefore, migration and invasion

assays were performed. The numbers of invasive and
migratory cells per high power field were counted. Both
H1299 (p < 0.01) (Figure 4A) and A549 (p < 0.01)
(Figure 4B) cells that were transfected with the miR-194
vector exhibited significantly reduced rates of migratory
and invasive capacity compared to H1299 and A549 cells
transfected with the control vector respectively.

Given that NSCLC cells treated with the miR-194
vector exhibited reduced migratory and invasive capacity
in vitro, we therefore examined the metastatic capacity of
these cells in vivo. Thin histologic sections of the lungs
were obtained from mice that had been implanted with
tumor cells. The number of metastatic nodules were
counted. Mice that had been implanted with A549 cells

dissected lungs are shown (Figure 4C).

capacity. Overexpression of FOXA1 significantly reduced
the rates of apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Both H1299miR-194 (p < 0.01) and A549-miR-194 (p < 0.01) cells
that were induced to overexpress FOXA1 demonstrated
reduced rates of apoptosis compared to the control
(Figure 6A). Overexpression of FOXA1 also restored
both the migratory and invasive capacities of NSCLC
cells transfected with miR-194. Both H1299-miR-194
(p < 0.01) and A549-miR-194 (p < 0.01) cells that were
induced to overexpress FOXA1 exhibited significantly
increased capacities to both migrate and invade compared
to the control (Figure 6B). Finally, western blot was used
to confirm anti-apoptotic action of FOXA1. Both H1299miR-194 and A549-miR-194 cells overexpressing FOXA1
expressed greater levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins
BCL-2 and Cyclin D1 and recued levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax compared to control (Figure 6C).
These findings suggest that FOXA1 is responsible for
the tumorigenic effects in NSCLC cells, and reduction of
FOXA1 via miR-194 inhibits those effects.

FOXA1 is a direct target of miR-194
Because miR-194 expression is associated with both
decreased tumor growth and metastatic capacity, a search for
a potential binding protein was performed. FOXA1 is one
such protein, TargetScan demonstrated a putative binding
site to miR-194 in the 3’ UTR region of FOXA1 (FOXA1WT) (Figure 5A). A mutated FOXA1 construct (FOXA1WT) was also created, with mutations at the binding site
(Figure 5A). A luciferase assay was subsequently performed
on H1299 cells transfected with either the miR-194 vector
or the control vector and subsequently treated with either
the FOXA1-WT protein or the FOXA1-MUT protein. Cells
co-transfected with the miR-194 vector and the FOXA1WT protein had significantly lower levels of luciferase
activity than cells co-transfected with the control vector and
the FOXA1-WT protein (p < 0.01) (Figure 5B). Conversely,
cells co-transfected with the miR-194 vector and the
FOXA1-MUT protein had similar levels of luciferase
activity as cells co-transfected with the control vector and
the FOXA1-MUT protein (Figure 5B).
Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot
were then used to determine expression levels of native
FOXA1 in cells transfected with the miR-194 vector.
Both H1299 (p < 0.01) and A549 (p < 0.01) cells that
were transfected with the miR-194 vector had significantly
lower levels of FOXA1 mRNA than H1299 and A549
cells transfected with the control vector respectively
(Figure 5C). Subsequently, cells transfected with the
miR-194 vector also had reduced expression of FOXA1
(Figure 5D). FOXA1 mRNA levels were also measured
in non-tumor tissue. NSCLC tissue had significantly
higher levels of FOXA1 mRNA than paired non-tumor
tissue (p < 0.01) (Figure 5E). Further, Pearson correlation
analysis demonstrated an inverse relationship between
FOXA1 mRNA levels and miR-194 levels (p < 0.001)
(Figure 5F). Overall, the above findings suggest that
binding of miR- 194 to FOXA1 results in the degradation
of the FOXA1 protein. When miR-194 levels are low, as in
NSCLC tissue, FOXA1 levels remain elevated.

miR-194 regulates the sensitivity of NSCLC cells
to DDP in vitro
Finally, we wished to assess the sensitivity of
NSCLC cells to chemotherapy based on their expression
level of miR-194. We first examined miR-194 expression
in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells (A549/DPP). A549/
DPP cells expressed significantly lower levels of miR- 194
than A549 cisplatin-sensitive cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 7A).
We then examined miR-194 expression in A549/DPP cells
transfected with the miR-194 vector versus the control
vector. These cells expressed significantly greater levels
of miR-194 than the control (p < 0.01) (Figure 7B), thus
confirming the efficacy of the vector in the cisplatinresistant line. Next, we examined the half maximal
inhibitory concentration of DPP for A549/DPP cells
transfected with the miR-194 vector. These cells had a
significantly lower half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) than cells transfected with the control vector
(p < 0.01) (Figure 7C). Lastly, we determined the rate of
apoptosis in A549/DPP cells transfected with the miR- 194
vector. These cells exhibited a significantly higher rate
of apoptosis than the control (p < 0.01) (Figure 7D).
Overall, these findings suggest that increased expression
of miR-194 improves the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the
chemotherapeutic agent DPP, whereby cells that express
higher levels of miR-194 not only have higher rates of
apoptosis but also require a significantly smaller amount
of the drug to produce the same effect.

Expression of FOXA1 could partially restore
the pro-apoptotic and anti-invasion function of
miR-194
Having confirmed that miR-194 acts to reduce
FOXA1 levels in NSCLC cells, we then wished to
determine whether this action of miR-194 is responsible for
its tumorigenic effects. We therefore reintroduced FOXA1
expression in NSCLC cells that overexpressed miR-194
and determined its effect on apoptosis and metastatic

gastric cancer [11, 19, 20], endometrial cancer [21, 22],
renal cell carcinoma [23], prostate cancer [24], pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [25, 26], osteosarcoma [27], colorectal
carcinoma [28, 29], multiple myeloma [30], hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [30], and esophageal adenocarcinoma
[31, 32]. Additionally, miR-194 may play an indirect role
in the prevention of HCC, it has been shown to regulate the
hepatitis C virus binding target CD81, thereby preventing
entry of the virus into hepatocytes [33].
In this study, we have demonstrated a mechanism
that miR-194 was decreased in clinical NSCLC tissues
compared to adjacent normal lung tissues and that miR194 played a critical role in NSCLC progression by

regulating cell proliferation and invasion via negatively
regulate FOXA1. The roles of miR-194 in this study were
consistent with other studies, which showed significant
growth inhibition in several cancer cell types [34–37]. In
gastric cancer, overexpression of miR-194 was associated
with decreased tumor size and less advanced tumor stage,
though was not associated with cell proliferation [19]. Yet
another study examining miR-194’s role in preventing the
progression of gastric cancer suggested that it was miR194’s regulation of the protein RBX1 that was responsible
for its inhibitory effect. In endometrial cancer, miR-194
was also found to have a protective effect, increasing
levels of E-cadherin and reducing levels of vimentin,
thus inhibiting cellular invasion via its regulation of the

protein BMI-1 [21]. Patients with endometrial cancers
that produced higher levels of miR-194 also had a
better prognosis [22]. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
miR- 194 overexpression results in reduced migratory
and invasive capacity of RCC cells [23]. In osteosarcoma,
overexpression of miR-194 inhibits tumor growth and
metastatic potential via the regulation of CDH2 and
IGF1R [27]. In colorectal carcinoma, miR-194 inhibits
cell viability and invasion via its actions on the AKT2
pathway. It is also expressed in lower amounts with
increasing tumor grade [28]. Another study had similar
findings regarding the role of miR-194 in colorectal
carcinoma, though it suggested that miR-194 regulated
the MAP4K4/c-Jun/MDM2 signaling pathway [29]. In my
present study, overexpression of miR-194 inhibited cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo.
These data consisted with previous results that miR-194
inhibits the capacity of NSCLC cells to metastasis [30].
And our data also showed that miR-194 was decreased in
NSCLC tissues and associated with poor prognosis.

Cisplatin resistance is still a major obstacle for the
clinical therapy of NSCLC with advanced stage. Our
data showed that miR-194 was significantly decreased
in stage III–IV. It is interesting to investigate whether
miR-194 would affect the NSCLC cells sensitive to
DDP. As we expected, overexpression of miR-194 are
more prone to apoptosis when treated with a DDP and
require a significantly reduced half maximal inhibitory
concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent. Our findings
suggest that miR-194 could play an important role in the
development of cisplatin resistance in NSCLC, consisted
with the results miR-194 was reduced in A549/DDP.
(Alterations of microRNAs in cisplatin-resistant human
non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP)).
In summary, we showed that low levels of miR-194
are associated with worse prognosis of NSCLC and could
inhibit cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo.
Furthermore, a Together, our findings suggest that miR-194
acts as a tumor-inhibiting factor in NSCLC, and could be a
target for NSCLC, even patients with chemotherapy tolerance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plasmid construction and lentivirus production

Patients and tissue samples

An overexpression of miR-194 vector was
created according to our previous publications [9] with
following primer 5′-AAAGGATCCCAGGAGTTGTAAA
TCCGAGCCG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAAGAATTC
TTCATAGGTCAGAGCCCTGTGCA-3′. A full length
of human FOXA1 3′-UTR with a wide type and mutant
target sequence for miR-194 were cloned into downstream
of the of Renilla psi-CHECK2 (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) according to our previous publications. To force
expression of FOXA1, DNA fragment coding FOXA1
protein was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into
the pcDNA3.1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
with primers: Forward: 5′- AAAGCTAGCATGTTAGGA
ACTGTGAAGATGGAAG-3′; Reverse: 5′-AAACTCGA
GCTAGGAAGTGTTTAGGACGGGTCT-3′. All plasmids
were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The lentiviruses of miR-194 were generated by
co-transfecting HEK293T with pPACKH1 Lentivector
Packaging KIT (SBI) according to our previous
publications [9]. To generate the stable cell line, cells
were transfected with lentiviruses for 24 h and replaced
with complete culture medium. Infection efficiency was
confirmed by qRT-PCR 96 h after infection.

Paired NSCLC tissue and adjacent normal lung
tissue samples were obtained from 64 patients who had
undergone surgical resection without prior radiotherapy
or chemotherapy between April 2008 and May 2012 at
the department of Respiration of Shanghai 10th People’s
Hospital, affiliated to Tongji University in Shanghai,
China. Histopathologic, diagnostic, and clinicopathologic
staging of the patients from which the samples were
obtained was performed according to the current
International Union Against Cancer (UICC) protocol.
The use of these tissue specimens was approved by the
ethics committee of Shanghai 10th People’s Hospital and
conducted in adherence with the Declaration of Helsinki
protocols. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients. Specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80°C for further use.

Cell culture
Six NSCLC cell lines (A549, SPC-A1, 95C,
95D, NCI-H1299 and SK-MES-1) and a normal human
bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) were purchased
from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 100 units/ml
penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan,
USA) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO2. A
cisplatin-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cell
line (A549/DPP) was established and conserved by our lab
laboratory and maintained in a1 μg/l final concentration of
cisplatin as previously described [9].

Luciferase reporter assay
The luciferase reporter gene vector with wild type
FOXA1 (FOXA1-WT) or mutate FOXA1 (FOXA1-MUT)
co-transfected with miR-194 in HEK293T cells. Cells
were washed 48 h after transfection, lysed and assayed
using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay reagent (Promega,
Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell viability, colony-formation, cell-cycle, and
apoptosis assays

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR

Cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting
Kit 8 (CCK8, Dojindo, Japan) described in our previous
publications [9]. In brief, cells were seeded in 96well plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well in 100-μl
medium. 100 μ CCK-8was added to the culture at 1, 2,
3 days. Then the OD value was measured at 450 nm in a
spectrophotometer (Spectra Max Plus, Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, USA).
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates as 800 cells/
well for 14 days. Then, the medium was refreshed with
medium containing 10% FBS once every 3 days, and the
colony formation was observed. Colonies with more than
40 cells were counted. Four fields were employed, and
the mean was obtained. In addition, crys­tal violet staining
(Shanghai Jingtian Biotech Co., Ltd., JT-00518) was
applied and representative photographs were captured.
Apoptotic cells were examined using an Annexin
V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore, USA). The
samples were harvested and then stained with 5 μl of

Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For FOXA1 expression, reverse transcription was
performed with Superscript first-strand synthesis system
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
The following primers were used: FOXA1 forward, 5′- GC
AATACTCGCCTTACGGCT-3′ and reverse, 5′- TACA
CACCTTGGTAGTACGCC-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-ACA
ACTTTGGTATCGTGGAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCC
ATCACGCCACAGTTTC-3′. GAPDH was used as a
loading control. To quantify miR-194, the expression
level of miR-194 was measured by the TaqMan miRNA
Assay (ABI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. U6
snRNA were used as an internal loading control. qRT-PCR
was performed on an ABI 7900HT instrument (Applied
Biosystems, USA).All reactions were run in triplicate and
all experiments were carried at least three independent
times.

annexin V-PE and 5 μl of PI. Flow cytometer was
performed to detect cellular apoptosis, and the results
were analyzed using the Cell-QuestTM Pro software
(BD Biosciences, USA). Pretreated cells were harvested,
fixed in ice-cold 70 % ethanol at 4 °C overnight, and then
resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 1 mg/mL RNase
(Sigma, St. Louis, USA) and 50 μg/mL PI (Sigma) in a
dark box for 30 min at room temperature. The percentage
of cells in different phases of the cell cycle was calculated
by the Cell-QuestTM Pro software (BD Biosciences).

To produce experimental tumour formation assay,
A549 cells (1 × 107) infected with lentiviral constructs
carrying either the miR-194 vector or the control vector
were harvested and were washed and re-suspended in
serum-free RPMI-1640 medium, then were injected
subcutaneously into the left flanks of anesthetized
4-week-old nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored
by measuring the largest (a) and smallest (b) two
perpendicular diameters with a caliper, and calculating
the tumor volume (V) = a × b2 × 0.5. Tumor weights were
also measured.
To produce experimental metastasis, A549 cells
(1 × 106) infected with lentiviral constructs carrying either
the miR-194 vector or the control vector were harvested
and injected into the 6-week-old nude mice. Mouse lungs
were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded
in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm and stained with H & E.
The number of pulmonary metastatic tumor nodules was
counted under a light microscope at magnifications of ×100
and ×200. All the mice were sacrificed at 5 weeks later.

Migration and invasion assays
The transwell migration and invasion assay was
performed using standardized protocols as described
earlier [9]. Briefly, 3 × 104 cells in 100 μl serum-free
media were added to the upper chamber of an insert (8- μm
pore size, millepore) coated with or without Matrigel
(BD). 600 μl media containing 10% FBS were added
to the lower chamber. Cells were fixed and stained with
0.05% crystal violet after 12 hours or 36 hours for the
migration and invasion assays, respectively. Six random
fields of each chamber were photographed using an IX71
inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 200×
magnification.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SD (standard
deviation). Student’s t-test (two-tailed) or one-way
analysis of variance was performed to analyze the in vitro
and in vivo data. The association between miR- 194
expression and clinicopathological parameters was
assessed using the Pearson Chi-Square test. Overall
survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
evaluated by the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were
performed using the SPSS version 16.0 software package
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.

Western blot
Cells were harvested with 1× cell lysis buffer
(Promega). A total of 60  μg of total proteins were
separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST
buffer (Tris Buffer Saline containing 0.1% Tween-20) for
1 h at room temperature, and subsequently incubated with
antibodies against FOXA1, BCL-2, CyclinD1 (Proteintech)
or GAPDH (#2118, Cell Signaling Technology) overnight
at 4°C. After extensive washing with TBST buffer, the
blots were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit, horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. Protein bands were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents ECL (Millipore, MA, USA)
and the intensity of the bands was analyzed using Image J
software (National Institute of Health, USA).
