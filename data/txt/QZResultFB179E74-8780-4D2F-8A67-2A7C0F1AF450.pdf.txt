Abstract
Ibrutinib (Imbruvica), a small-drug inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine
kinase (BTK), is currently undergoing clinical testing in patients
with multiple myeloma, yet important questions on the role of BTK
in myeloma biology and treatment are outstanding. Using ﬂowsorted side population cells from human myeloma cell lines and
multiple myeloma primary samples as surrogate for the elusive
multiple myeloma stem cell, we found that elevated expression of
BTK in myeloma cells leads to AKT/WNT/b-catenin–dependent
upregulation of key stemness genes (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and
MYC) and enhanced self-renewal. Enforced transgenic expression
of BTK in myeloma cells increased features of cancer stemness,

Introduction
Following in the footsteps of exciting clinical data on the
efﬁcacy of the small-drug inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase
(BTK; refs. 1, 2) ibrutinib, in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; ref. 3) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL;
ref. 4) ibrutinib is now undergoing phase II clinical testing for
multiple myeloma– registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov as
NCT01478581 and NCT01962792. The promise of BTK as new
therapeutic target in multiple myeloma was ﬁrst suggested by 3
concurrent preclinical studies demonstrating that inhibition of
BTK with 3 different small molecules, ibrutinib (5), LFM-A13
(6), and CC-292 (7), effectively targets both myeloma cells,
including cancer stem cell (CSC)-like cells commonly referred

including clonogenicity and resistance to widely used myeloma
drugs, whereas inducible knockdown of BTK abolished them.
Furthermore, overexpression of BTK in myeloma cells promoted
tumor growth in laboratory mice and rendered side population–
derived tumors that contained high levels of BTK more sensitive
to the selective, second-generation BTK inhibitor, CGI1746, than
side population–derived tumors that harbored low levels of BTK.
Taken together, these ﬁndings implicate BTK as a positive regulator
of myeloma stemness and provide additional support for the
clinical testing of BTK-targeted therapies in patients with myeloma.

to as multiple myeloma stem cells (MMSC), and nonmalignant
bystander cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as osteoclasts (5–7).
BTK (8) is an X chromosome-encoded member of the Tec
protein tyrosine kinase family that has long been known to play
a central role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (9, 10). More
recent ﬁndings, though, place BTK in strategic positions of additional signal transduction pathways important for mature B
lymphocytes and plasma cells; for example, CXCR4-CXCL12
(SDF1) chemokine (11) and Toll-like receptor (12) signaling.
BTK's pleiotropic functionality in the B-lineage may complicate
efforts to elucidate the mechanisms by which targeted inhibition
of BTK suppresses neoplastic growth; that is, the mode of action in
multiple myeloma (5–7) may differ in some respects from that in
Waldenstr€
om macroglobulinemia (13), CLL (14), diffuse large Bcell lymphoma (15), and other blood cancers (16). It is also
possible that different subpopulations of tumor cells in the same
patient exhibit different degrees of BTK dependency, as suggested
by this study, in which MMSCs are shown to be more sensitive to
BTK inhibition than bulk myeloma cells. Elevated levels of BTK in
myeloma have been reported to prognosticate poor outcome
(17), although connections to increased cancer stemness have
not been established yet.
The available pipeline of selective BTK inhibitors, such as PCI32765 (ibrutinib; ref. 18) and CC-292 (19), has recently been
enriched by CGI1746, a promising compound that binds reversibly to BTK (20). With regard to the latter, CGI1746 exhibits
minimal, if any, cross-reactivity with the Tec family kinases, IL2inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) and BMX nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase (BMX; ref 20). The high target selectivity of CGI1746 may
render it useful for development as second-generation BTK inhibitor able to overcome primary and acquired resistance to ibrutinib
(21) as recently reported for MCL (22) and CLL (23), respectively.

BTK Is a Multiple Myeloma Stem Cell Gene

In this study, we concentrate on the role of BTK in myeloma
stemness, and show that BTK is upregulated in side population
cells, a widely used surrogate for the elusive MMSC (24, 25). We
demonstrate that enforced expression of BTK in HMCLs leads to
elevated clonogenic growth, increased expression of pluripotent/
embryonic stem cell (iPS/ES) genes, and heightened tolerance to
myeloma drugs. Conversely, knockdown of BTK abrogates these
changes. We also show that overexpression of BTK in myeloma
accelerates tumor formation in NOD/SCID mice, yet renders the
tumors more sensitive to CGI1746. Our ﬁndings on BTK's
involvement in myeloma stemness led us to postulate that therapeutic targeting of BTK in patients with myeloma may be most
effective in an adjuvant setting, when tumor mass is low and
MMSC-targeted drugs may be most effective.

Materials and Methods
Myeloma cell lines
The mouse cell line 5TGM1 was obtained from Dr. Gregory R.
Mundy (University of Vanderbilt, Nashville, TN). Human cell
lines H929, 8226, JJN3, and XG1 were kindly provided by Dr.
Simona Colla (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
ARP1, OCI-MY5, ARK, OPM2, and KMS28PE were kind gifts from
Dr. John Shaughnessy (University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences, Little Rock, AR). Cell lines were conﬁrmed to be mycoplasma-free. All myeloma cells were maintained at 37 C and 5%
CO2, using RPMI1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FCS (Gibco) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 mg/mL;
Sigma) as growth medium.
Reagent
BTK inhibitor, CGI1746, was a kind gift from Genentech, Inc.
ABCB1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
and other antibodies and LY2940002 were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Bortezomib was from Millennium; doxorubicin and
verapamil were from Sigma.
Flow cytometry
Side population cells were enumerated and ﬂow-sorted as
described previously (26). Brieﬂy, 1  106 cells were suspended
in 1 mL RPMI1640 media with 10% FBS and 5 mg/mL Hoechst
33342, and incubated in 37 C water bath for 90 minutes. Cells
treated with 100 mmol/L verapamil were used as negative control.
After incubation, cells were stained with CD138-FITC, k-APC or
l–PE antibodies and resuspended in ice-cold RPMI1640 media
with propidium iodide (2 mg/mL) for ﬂow analysis or sorting. Cell
death assays were performed using Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit APC (eBioscience), eFluxx-ID Multidrug resistance assay
was performed as according to the protocol (26).
Quantitative real time-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and reverse
transcribed using oligo dT primers and SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen; ref. 26). Target gene-speciﬁc primers and primers for
reference genes were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies or Invitrogen.
Lentiviral gene transduction
Genes were overexpressed or silenced as described previously
(27, 28). Transduction efﬁciency was determined by ﬂow cytometry, using a green ﬂuorescent reporter protein (GFP).

www.aacrjournals.org

The BTK promoter region positioned from 596 to 52 of
the transcriptional start site was cloned into lentiviral backbone vector driven by GFP. Human NANOG Reporter lentivirus (System Biosciences) was transfected according to the
protocol.
Clonogenicity assay
Clonogenic growth was evaluated by seeding 1  104 myeloma
cells in 0.5 mL RPMI1640 containing 0.33% agar and 10% FBS
(29). MethoCult H4535 without EPO (Stem Cell Technologies)
was used for serial replating.
Cell proliferation and viability assay
Cells were enumerated by Trypan blue staining using hemocytometer. IC50 of CGI1746 on multiple myeloma cells was
determined by PrestoBlue reagent (Invitrogen).
Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation assays
Protein levels in myeloma cells were determined using
immunoblotting (26). b-Actin and histone 2B were used as
benchmarks for total and nuclear proteins, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed as described
previously (29).
Myeloma xenograft tumors mouse model
Six-week-old NOD.Cg-Rag1tm1monInstakita Il2rgtm1wjl/SzJ
mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Experiments
were approved under the protocol of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA;
IACUC 1203033). Brieﬂy, 1  106 multiple myeloma cells of
ARP1-EV, APR1-BTK OE, H929-SCR, and H929-BTK shRNA cells
were injected subcutaneously into each mouse (n ¼ 5). Seven days
after injection, mice receiving H929 cells were given water containing doxycycline to induce the expression of BTK-shRNA.
Tumor size was measured twice a week, and tumor volume (mm3)
was calculated as 4p/3  (tumor diameter/2)3. Studies were
terminated once the tumors diameter reached 20 mm.
CGI1746 treatment on the mouse 5TGM1 myeloma model
Around 1  106 5TGM1 cells were injected into 10 C57BL/
KaLwRij mice from Harlan Laboratories through tail-vein injection. Mice were divided into 2 groups, CGI1746 (100 mg/kg,
s.c.) treatment group and control group treated with cremophor/ethanol solution for dissolving CGI1746. CGI1746 was
treated three times per week beginning 7 days after injection.
Blood drawn occurred weekly with tumor burden determined
by blood lgG2b levels via an Elisa IgG2b detection kit (Bethyl
Laboratories).
About 5  104 5TGM1 side population or non-side population
cells were injected into 20 C57BL/KaLwRij mice. Mice were
divided into 4 experimental groups; side population or non-side
population control groups treated with cremophor/ethanol solution or CGI1746 (100 mg/kg, s.c.) as above.
Statistical analysis
The survival data were plotted using Kaplan–Meier curve and
analyzed by log-rank test. Multiple groups (3) were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA, and paired groups were analyzed by twoway ANOVA or Student t test. P < 0.05 was considered as
signiﬁcant.

Results
BTK protein levels in patients with myeloma and inhibition of
myeloma cells by CGI1746
Microarray-based global gene expression proﬁling (6) and
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; ref. 17) have been recently
used by other investigators to convincingly demonstrate that BTK
mRNA levels are elevated in myeloma cells compared with
normal plasma cells. To complement these ﬁndings with BTK
protein expression data, we immunostained bone marrow biopsies of 34 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma using an
antibody to BTK. Designating immunoreactivity in 25% of
myeloma cells as cutoff for BTK expression, we found 27
(80%) cases to be positive and 7 (20%) cases negative.
Semiquantitative evaluation of tissue sections by a hematopathologist identiﬁed 3, 9, and 15 cases as BTKHigh, BTKFair, and BTKLow,
respectively. An example of moderate BTK expression is shown
in Fig. 1A. Examples of BTKHigh and BTKLow myelomas are
depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1. Next, we asked whether
CGI1746 inhibits HMCLs in vitro. Treatment of ARP1 and
OPM2 cells with a dose range of drug (0.2–50 mmol/L; 48
hours) resulted in similar levels of cytotoxicity in both cell lines

(IC50 ﬃ 10 mmol/L; Fig. 1B). We further tested CGI1746 effect
in 5TGM1 mouse model. Figure 1B (left) shows that mice
receiving BTK inhibitor survived signiﬁcantly longer (median
survival 57 days) than mice left untreated (median survival 39
days). The survival results were corroborated by measurements
of serum levels of IgG2b, a biomarker of 5TGM1 tumor burden.
IgG2b rose earlier and more quickly in the control rather than
drug-treated mice (Fig. 1C, right).
Elevated BTK expression is a feature of putative MMSCs
The CD138 subpopulation of cells, which exhibits features of
cancer stemness, has been used as a stand-in for studies on MMSCs
(30). To determine the expression of BTK in this subpopulation,
we used CD138 magnetic beads to fractionate CD138 and
CD138þ cells from 10 different cell lines. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated in all cases that BTK was more highly expressed in the
CD138 fraction. The magnitude of the increase ranged from
a modest 1.5-fold in KMS28PE to nearly 50-fold in OCI-MY5
(Fig. 2A). To conﬁrm these ﬁndings with a method of MMSC
isolation that is widely considered to be more stringent and
reliable, we obtained the small but consistently detected side

population from two cell lines with moderate to low elevations of
BTK: OPM2 and ARP1 (24, 26). RT-PCR measurements showed
that, compared with main population cells, side population cells
harbored considerably higher BTK mRNA levels than seen in the
CD138 assay: an approximately 150-fold increase in ARP1 and a
approximately 35-fold increase in OPM2 (Fig. 2B, top rows). Be
this as it may, elevated BTK expression was associated with a
marked upregulation of three stem cell genes, NANOG, MYC, and
SOX2, and a moderate upregulation of four additional stem cell
genes: SMO, GLI1, NOTCH1, and OCT4 (Fig. 2B). To translate this
investigation to patient-derived myeloma samples, we compared
the expression of BTK in ﬂow-sorted IgL-restricted (IgLR) sidepopulation cells with that in CD138þ main population cells: (26)
BTK mRNA levels in the former were on average 2.5 times higher
than in the latter (Fig. 2C).
To complement the results described above with a method that
yields larger samples of cells than possible using CD138 or side
population fractionations, we developed a reporter-based genetic
method for ﬂow sorting of myeloma cells according to BTK
promoter activity. OCI-MY5, ARP1, and OPM2 cells were trans-

www.aacrjournals.org

duced with a lentivirus-encoded GFP reporter gene under transcriptional control of the BTK promoter. Cells were ﬂow sorted to
collect the top and bottom deciles of GFP expressors (Fig. 2D). RTPCR analysis validated the method by demonstrating that
GFPHigh cells harbored approximately ﬁve times more BTK message than GFPLow cells (Fig. 2E). Next, we performed serial colony
formation assays using three consecutive passages of ARP1 cells to
evaluate the possibility that BTK promotes clonogenicity. Compared with GFPLowBTKLow cells, GFPHighBTKHigh cells not only
exhibited signiﬁcantly increased clonogenic potential upon initial
plating (110  23 vs. 58  13 colonies, P < 0.05; Student t test),
but also greater capacity for further increase upon second and
third replating (P ¼ 0.012; one-way ANOVA; Fig. 2F).
Enforced expression of BTK enhances myeloma stemness
To prove BTK is a driver rather than a consequential phenomenon in keeping features of cancer stemness in myeloma, ARP1
and OPM2 cells were transfected with lentiviral particles that
encoded a BTK cDNA gene. Western blotting showed that compared with cells infected with noncoding "empty" virus (BTKWT

used as control), cells overexpressing BTK (BTKOE) contained
elevated amounts of (i) total and phosphorylated BTK, (ii) total
and phosphorylated PLCg2, a downstream substrate of BTK in the
BCR signaling pathway, and (iii) NANOG, a master regulator of
stemness (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR analysis of the iPS/ES genes OCT4,
SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28A revealed 5-fold to 8-fold increases in
mRNA levels in BTKOE cells compared with BTKWT cells (Fig. 3B).
Soft agar clonogenicity assays demonstrated BTK-dependent elevations of colony numbers in BTKOE versus BTKWT cells: 12.9%
versus 8.63% in case of ARP1 and 13.7% versus 9.94% for OPM2
(results not shown). Next, using the ﬂow cytometric, we found
that overexpression of BTK in both ARP1 and OPM2 cells led to a
approximately 3-fold increase in the abundance of side population cells (Fig. 3C). To determine whether enforced expression of
BTK also increased tumorigenicity of myeloma cells, we subcutaneously injected ARP1 cells into NOD/SCID mice. BTKOE cells
generated tumors more effectively than their BTKWT counterparts
(Fig. 3D).
BTK promotes drug resistance in myeloma
Because CSCs have been implicated in acquisition of drug
resistance in patients with cancer, we investigated whether
enforced expression of BTK blunts the response of myeloma cells
to widely used myeloma drugs. Clonogenic growth assays demonstrated that regardless of experimental conditions, BTKOE cells
produced more colonies than BTKWT cells (Fig. 4A). Compared
with BTKWT cells, the growth advantage of BTKOE cells treated for 2
weeks with bortezomib, doxorubicin, or etoposide was more
pronounced (2.5- to 5.3-fold) than that of BTKOE cells left
untreated (1.57-fold; Fig. 4A). Flow cytometric determination of
immunoreactivity to Annexin V, a marker of apoptotic cell death,
revealed a similar picture, as the survival advantage of untreated
BTKOE compared with BTKWT cells (33%) increased to levels that
ranged from 74% (0.5 nmol/L bortezomib) to 81% (5 nmol/L
bortezomib) under conditions of treatment (Fig. 4B). To elucidate
the mechanism by which BTK promotes drug resistance in myeloma, we determined the activity of the ABC transporter efﬂux
pump with the assistance of the eFluxx-ID Gold MDR assay. The
mean ﬂuorescence intensity exhibited a strong verapamil-dependent increase in BTKOE cells (50%–65%; Fig. 4C, left). In keeping
with that, Western blotting demonstrated increased expression
of the transporter protein, ABCB1, in BTKOE compared with
BTKWT cells, and an increase of pBCL2Ser70, a phosphorylated
and hyperactive form of the antiapoptotic protein (Fig. 4C,
right), while the total form of other BCL2 family genes, BCL2,
BCL-XL, and MCL1, showed no change (data now shown).
Next, we performed colony formation assays to assess the
possibility that drug efﬂux pump inhibition restores the sensitivity of BTKOE cells to bortezomib. Figure 4D shows that
exposure of cells to verapamil alone caused little if any change
in the clonogenic growth of BTKOE compared with BTKWT cells.
However, combination treatment was more effective because
the corresponding BTKOE to BTKWT ratios dropped from 5.30 in
cells treated with bortezomib alone to 2.20 in cells treated with
bortezomib and verapamil.
Inducible downregulation of BTK reduces growth, survival,
stemness, and tumorigenicity of myeloma cells

BTK Is a Multiple Myeloma Stem Cell Gene

led us to evaluate whether inducible knockdown of BTK in
myeloma cells results in downregulation of NANOG and loss of
clonogenicity. OCI-MY5 cells were cotransfected with lentivirus
encoding a NANOG promoter–driven GFP reporter and the
doxycycline-inducible BTK shRNA or control knockdown constructs used above (Fig. 5E, top left). Cells were fractionated by
ﬂow sorting according to reporter gene expression (GFPþ vs.
GFP; Fig. 5E, top right), treated with doxycycline for 48 hours
to downregulate BTK, and harvested for gene expression analysis
using RT-PCR (Fig. 5E, bottom left). We observed a signiﬁcant
shRNA-dependent reduction of BTK message in both GFPþ and
GFP BTKKD cells compared with BTKWT. Changes in NANOG
expression exhibited the same trend: a 5.5-fold drop in GFPþ
BTKKD versus GFPþBTKWT cells and a approximately 13-fold
reduction in GFPBTKKD relative to GFPBTKWT cells. Clonogenic
growth was also dependent on BTK and NANOG levels, as GFPþ
BTKWT and GFPBTKWT cells exhibited clonogenicity more or less
robustly, yet BTKKD cells failed in that regard (Fig. 5E, bottom
right).
BTK governs, in part, AKT and WNT/b-catenin signaling in
myeloma
To elucidate the mechanism by which BTK regulates signal
transduction in myeloma cells, we sought to identify BTK-interacting proteins using co-IP analysis in BTKOE ARP1 and OPM2
cells. Figure 6A shows that antibody to BTK (bait) pulled down the
WNT/b-catenin stabilizer, CDC73 (31). Conversely, antibody
to CDC73 pulled down BTK. This suggested physical interaction
of the two proteins in myeloma cells. Next, we interrogated
the WNT/b-catenin pathway in the paired BTKOE/BTKWT and
BTKKD/BTKWT cell lines described in Figs. 3–5. Immunoblotting
showed that BTKOE cells harbored increased amounts of b-catenin, phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), and phosphorylated GSK3b
(pGSK3b), whereas BTKKD cells contained reduced amounts of
these proteins relative to WT controls (Fig. 6B). BTK directly
phosphorylates AKT in B cells. Following up on the results
presented in Fig. 4C and previous work from our laboratory
suggesting that AKT-dependent activation of ABCB1 and BCL2
underlies drug resistance in myeloma (29), we performed a dye
efﬂux assay using the AKT inhibitor, LY2940002. Figure 6C
shows that BTKOE cells responded to that treatment by retaining
more dye in the cytoplasm, an indication that ABCB1 and
related drug efﬂux proteins require upstream AKT signaling to
operate properly in myeloma cells. Immunoblotting supported
this interpretation as BTKOE cells treated with LY2940002
contained less ABCB1, pBCL2, and b-catenin than their
BTKWT counterparts (Fig. 6D). Because we have recently shown
that CSC-like myeloma cells may overexpress NANOG in a
WNT/b-catenin–dependent manner (26), we treated BTKOE
cells with the b-catenin inhibitor CAY10404. Figure 6E shows
that this treatment led to decreased NANOG protein levels.

as control. In case of ARP1, 1.61% and 7.88% of BTKHigh cells
either treated with inhibitor or left untreated gave rise to colonies, a ratio of 0.204. The same ratio for BTKLow cells was 0.533,
indicating that treatment with CGI1746 affected BTKHigh cells
2.6 times more severely than BTKLow cells. OPM2 cells showed
the similar trend as ARP1 cells (Fig. 7B). To extend these
observations in vivo, we transferred 5TGM1 cells, previously
ﬂow-sorted as side population and main population. Figure
7C (left) shows that untreated mice harboring side population–
derived tumors exhibited the shortest median survival (61 days),
followed by untreated mice containing main population–
derived tumors (89 days). Treatment of mice with CGI1746
prolonged the median survival in both cases: 119 days in the side
population group and "undeﬁned" (after 140 days of observation, at which time the study was terminated) in the main
population group. The survival results were corroborated by
changes in serum IgG2b M-spike levels, an imperfect but widely
used biomarker of tumor burden (Fig. 7C, right). Figure 7D
shows that CGI1746 was also effective in preliminary studies
comparing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from BTK-deﬁcient

suppressed NANOG in myeloma cells, suggests that inhibition
of the WNT/b-catenin/NANOG axis may be a promising MMSCtargeted therapy.
In addition to testing promising myeloma drug candidates,
such as CGI1746, in tumor transplantation-based mouse models of myeloma, the compounds should also be evaluated in
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) in which myeloma-like tumors arise spontaneously. A number of GEMMs
driven by constitutive oncogenes, including MYC, BCL2L1 (BclXL), IL6, CCND1, and XBP1, are available for myeloma drug
testing, with some of them, particularly Vk	 MYC (38), iMycBclXL (39), and IL6Myc (40), already having demonstrated capability to assess objective treatment responses. The genetically
and environmentally controlled setting of a preclinical mouse
drug study may provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts compared to a
clinical trial.
In conclusion, this study provides preclinical evidence for a role
of BTK in myeloma stemness, and directs attention to including
BTK inhibitors in MMSC-targeted drug cocktails aimed at eradicating MMSCs and curing myeloma in clinics.

Discussion
The main ﬁnding of this study is experimental evidence for an
important role of BTK in myeloma stemness. A working model of
BTK's function in MMSC is depicted in Fig. 7E. Using ﬂow-sorted
myeloma side population cells as surrogate for MMSCs, we
showed that elevated expression of BTK is associated with both
upregulation of key iPS/ES genes (e.g., OCT4, SOX2, NANOG,
MYC) and enhanced self-renewal (serial passage of clonogenicity). Enforced expression of BTK in myeloma cells increased
features of stemness (e.g., side population, clonogenicity, iPS/ES
genes, drug resistance), whereas knockdown of BTK abolished
them. In vitro results of this sort were underlined by in vivo studies
using laboratory mice, demonstrating that overexpression of BTK
in myeloma cells promotes tumor growth and renders SP/BTKHigh
tumors derived from 5TGM1 myeloma more sensitive to BTK
inhibitor, CGI1746, than their MP/BTKLow tumor counterparts.
Although the growth inhibition in vivo was not as potent as in vitro
study, there is statistically signiﬁcant inhibition effect in vivo (P <
0.05). The discrepancy of BTK-shRNA between in vitro and in vivo
may be caused tumor environment, because some factors from
the environment may rescue partial effects induced by BTKshRNA.
BTK can now be added to the growing list of candidate
myeloma stemness and drug resistance genes that have been
uncovered by us (26, 28, 29, 32, 33) and others (34). The master
stem cell factor NANOG, which is positively regulated by BTK
according to this study and by RARa2 according to our previous
report (26), illustrates this point. Upregulation of NANOG,
which is often attributed to constitutive WNT/b-catenin signaling under conditions of heightened cancer stemness (35), is
tightly associated with adverse outcome in solid and hematologic cancers (36). b-Catenin promotes NANOG expression
directly, by virtue of binding to the NANOG promoter, and
also indirectly by suppressing TCF-3, a negative regulator of
NANOG (37). Our ﬁnding that myeloma cells contained
increased levels of b-catenin in a BTK-dependent manner, and
that inhibition of WNT/b-catenin signaling using CAY10404
