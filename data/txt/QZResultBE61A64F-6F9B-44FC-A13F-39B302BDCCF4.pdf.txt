ABSTRACT
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that promotes G2/M-phase
transition, is expressed in elevated levels in high-risk neuroblastomas and correlates
with unfavorable patient outcome. Recently, we and others have presented PLK1 as a
potential drug target for neuroblastoma, and reported that the BI2536 PLK1 inhibitor
showed antitumoral actvity in preclinical neuroblastoma models. Here we analyzed
the effects of GSK461364, a competitive inhibitor for ATP binding to PLK1, on typical
tumorigenic properties of preclinical in vitro and in vivo neuroblastoma models.
GSK461364 treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines reduced cell viability and proliferative
capacity, caused cell cycle arrest and massively induced apoptosis. These phenotypic
consequences were induced by treatment in the low-dose nanomolar range, and were
independent of MYCN copy number status. GSK461364 treatment strongly delayed
established xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, and significantly increased survival
time in the treatment group. These preclinical findings indicate PLK1 inhibitors may be
effective for patients with high-risk or relapsed neuroblastomas with upregulated PLK1
and might be considered for entry into early phase clinical trials in pediatric patients.

INTRODUCTION

that inhibition with the small molecule, BI2536, effectively
decreased growth in cell and mouse models [6, 31]. Normal,
but not cancer, cells have previously been shown to survive
PLK1 depletion [32]. A small molecule screen to identify
kinase inhibitors that suppress neuroblastoma tumor initiating
cell (TIC) proliferation identified PLK1 as a promising target
whereas only exceedingly high inhibitor concentrations
were cytotoxic for neural stem cells in this screen [33].
These results indicate that targeting this aberrant mitotic
kinase signaling pathway in precision therapies that combine
targeted drugs and standard chemotherapy could benefit
patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
The three PLK1 inhibitors currently furthest in
clinical development are the dihydropteridinone derivatives,
BI2536 and BI6727 (volasertib), and the imidazotriazine,
GSK461364 [34–37]. All three are competitive inhibitors of
ATP-kinase binding. GSK461364 treatment produced fewer
side effects related to toxicity than BI2536. Side effects in
patients treated with GSK461364 included vein thromboses
in patients not co-treated with low molecular weight heparin
and mild myelotoxicity [36, 38]. GSK461364 treatment at
half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) below 100
nM inhibited proliferation in multiple tumor cell lines [35,
39, 40]. Here we evaluated the ability of GSK461364 to
inhibit neuroblastoma cell viability and proliferation and to
induce death in cell lines with different MYCN copy number
backgrounds, and to suppress xenograft tumor growth in
nude mice.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial
solid tumor in childhood [1]. It is characterized by a broad
biological heterogeneity based on molecular genetic
variations in MYCN oncogene copy number, chromosomal
ploidy changes or partial losses and gains, alterations in
neurotrophin receptor expression that correlate to different
degrees with clinical outcome [2] and with recurrent
mutations in a few genes [3]. Clinical course ranges from
complete spontaneous regression or differentiation of lowstage or stage 4s neuroblastomas, even without therapeutic
intervention, to widespread metastatic disease that is
refractory to aggressive multimodal therapies. Although
treatment of solid tumors in childhood has significantly
improved over the past decades, overall survival in
high-risk neuroblastoma patients remains less than 40%
despite intensive therapy regimens [1]. While 20% of
neuroblastomas harbor MYCN amplifications, directly
classifying them as high-risk, around 50% of high-risk
tumors lack MYCN amplification and display molecular
diversity within the high-risk tumor group [1, 4]. Since 40
to 50% of patients initially diagnosed with neuroblastoma
must be assigned to the high-risk group [5, 6], treatment of
this disease remains challenging for pediatric oncologists
and novel therapeutic options are still urgently needed.
Loss of cell cycle regulatory control is a major
hallmark of many cancers, including neuroblastoma [7, 8].
The serine/threonine kinase, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1),
is an essential regulator promoting entry into the mitotic
phase from the G2/M transition point in the cell cycle of
nontransformed cells and after a DNA damage checkpoint
arrest [9–11]. There is increasing evidence that elevated
PLK1 activity might serve as a tumor-promoting force by
stimulating mitotic transcriptional programs to evade the
DNA damage checkpoint [12, 13]. PLK1 expression is higher
in cancer cells than in nontransformed cells, and promotes
G1/S transition and DNA replication in addition to the G2/M
phase transition [14–16]. PLK1 dysregulation is initiated
early in carcinogenesis, and promotes cellular processes
necessary for oncogenesis and enhances pro-oncogenic
signaling networks, including TP53 and RB1 [17–20].
A wide variety of cancers including entities
predominantly occurring in children overexpress PLK1
[21–29]. PLK1 was identified as one of the most important
survival kinases for rhabdomyosarcoma in a genome-wide
siRNA library screen [21]. Inhibiting PLK1 in xenografts or
cell lines deriving from osteosarcoma and medulloblastoma,
another embryonal tumor of childhood, suppressed
proliferation and induced apoptosis [22–24, 29]. Abbou
and colleagues recently demonstrated preclinical efficacy of
PLK1 inhibition in a wide panel of pediatric malignancies
independent of tumor histology [30]. PLK1 upregulation in
primary neuroblastomas strongly correlates with high-risk
disease [6]. We and others have previously demonstrated that
PLK1 is a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma, and

RESULTS
PLK1 pathway inhibition by GSK461364
reduces viability and clonogenicity of
neuroblastoma cells
Neuroblastoma cell lines have previously been
shown to express high PLK1 protein levels, similar to
expression in primary tumors [6]. To survey a broad
range of aggressive neuroblastoma subtype backgrounds,
we selected neuroblastoma cell lines either lacking
(SK-N-AS, SH-SY5Y, SH-EP) or harboring (Kelly,
IMR32, SK-N-BE) MYCN amplifications for in vitro
analyses. We assessed cellular viability using MTT
assays. GSK461364 treatment significantly reduced
viability of neuroblastoma cells in culture (Figure 1A
and 1B). Fifty percent inhibition of growth (GI50) was
observed at inhibitor concentrations below 20 nM in our
cell line panel. Viability was comparably suppressed
in all cell lines, regardless of whether they harbored
MYCN amplifications or TP53 mutations. To insure
that GSK461364 was inhibiting PLK1 activity in our
experiments, we assessed expression and phosphorylation
of target proteins downstream of PLK1 in treated and
untreated SK-N-AS and IMR-32 cells comprising MST1,
MST2, pMST1/2, WEE1 and pWEE1 (Supplementary
Figure 1). We next assessed clonal expansion in the SK6731

1C and 1D). Pulsed GSK461364 treatment for only 24
hours with GI80 still reduced colony formation by more
than 50% after 10 days in culture (Figure 1C and  1D).

Our experiments show that GSK461364-mediated PLK1
inhibition significantly reduced neuroblastoma cell
viability and colony-forming ability in vitro, even when
applied in short-term treatment pulses. These effects

by MYCN and TP53 status.

influence on the neuroblastic cell cycle. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering clearly separated untreated
from GSK461364-treated cells (Figure 3A). Gene set
enrichment analyses identified increased expression
of genes associated with G2/M and a decline in
expression of genes essential for S-phase transition
(Figure 3B and 3C). Three gene sets associated with the
E2F transcription factor family, E2F3 and E2F1 were
among the most downregulated in GSK461364-treated
cells (Figure 3B, 3C and Supplementary Table 1 and
2). We also validated E2F1 and E2F3 downregulation
in GSK461364-treated SK-N-AS and IMR-32 cells
using western blotting (Supplementary Figure 1).
We also applied GSEA analysis for cancer-related
signatures to the expression data from GSK461364treated and untreated SK-N-AS cells. Genes known to
be upregulated by RB1 tumor suppressor loss (gene set
RB_DN.V1_UP) were downregulated in GSK461364treated cells compared to untreated controls
(Supplementary Table 2). Since RB1 regulates the
G1/S transition via E2F transcription factors [42, 43],
these results are in line with our observed drop in gene
expression associated with S-phase transition. We
conclude that GSK461364 treatment not only induces
expression patterns associated with a G2/M arrest, but
might also inhibit G1/S transition via the RB1-E2F axis
in neuroblastoma cells.

PLK1 inhibition reduces proliferation and
induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
neuroblastoma cells
We next explored how GSK461364 inhibits
neuroblastoma cell viability. We assessed proliferation
and apoptosis in the SK-N-AS and IMR32 cell lines
after short- and long-pulsed GSK461364 treatment,
and flow cytometrically monitored cell cycle phase
distribution in treated versus control cell cultures.
Flow cytometric analyses were conducted after 24 and
72 hours of GSK461364 treatment. A larger proportion
of cells treated with GI50 or GI80 concentrations of
GSK461364 were in G2/M compared to untreated
cultures (Figure 2A). These results are consistent with a
previous report that PLK1 activity is necessary for mitotic
entry from G2/M arrest induced by DNA damage [41],
and indicate that GSK461364-mediated PLK inhibition
prevents neuroblastoma cell cycle progression. The
effects of GSK461364 on G2/M arrest and apoptosis in
neuroblastoma cells did not appear to be influenced by the
cellular MYCN background (single copy vs. amplified).
BrdU incorporation 24 hours after beginning GSK461364
treatment at GI50 concentrations was significantly reduced
in SK-N-AS and IMR32 cells compared with untreated
cultures (Figure 2B). Proliferation, as measured by BrdU
incorporation, was also further reduced by treating cells
with the GI80 or 5-fold GI50 GSK461364 concentrations.
GSK461364 treatment also increased the proportion
of sub-G1 cells, which includes apoptotic cells (Figure
2A). Treatment at GI80 resulted in slightly more sub-G1
cells than treatment at GI50, and the effect was most
pronounced after 72 hours of treatment. We confirmed that
GI50 GSK461364 concentrations significantly induced
apoptosis in SK-N-AS and IMR32 cells using the cell
death detection ELISA™ (Figure 2C), and apoptotic cell
fractions rose further when GSK461364 concentrations
were increased to GI80 or 5-fold GI50. These data
demonstrate that GSK461364 inhibits proliferation and
induces both cell cycle arrest at the G2/M restriction point
and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, regardless of MYCN
status.

GSK461364-mediated PLK1 inhibition
has antitumoral activity against human
neuroblastoma xenografts in mice
To investigate GSK461364 efficacy in vivo, we
treated a xenograft model for high-risk neuroblastoma
grown subcutaneously in nude mice. The SK-N-AS cell
line lacks MYCN amplification and is derived from a bone
marrow metastasis from a patient with stage 4 disease
[44]. SK-N-AS cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flanks of immunocompromised mice, and xenograft tumor
development was monitored until they reached 200 µl in
volume. GSK461364 (50 mg / kg body weight) or vehicle
alone (control group) was intraperitoneally administered
once daily to 6 mice per group. GSK461364 treatment
significantly reduced tumor volume compared to controls
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed that treatment delayed tumor growth to 2,500 mm3
by 22 days (time when the first tumor in the control group
reached 2,500 mm3 compared to when the first tumor
in the treatment group reached 2,500 mm3, Figure 4A),
thus, significantly increasing survival in the treatment
cohort. One of 6 mice in the treatment group had to be
euthanized due to cachexia. Mice harboring subcutaneous
xenograft tumors formed from MYCN-amplified IMR32
cells were also treated using the same GSK461364 or
control injection regimen. IMR32 xenograft tumors
developed considerably slower than SK-N-AS xenograft

tumors. GSK461364 treatment also significantly
reduced IMR32 xenograft tumor growth compared to
the control group (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure
2B). Immunohistological examination of xenograft
tumors showed that GSK461364 reduced the number of

proliferating cells and increased the number of apoptotic
cells in tumors (Figure 4C). Our data clearly demonstrate
that GSK461364 treatment in vivo suppresses growth of
xenografts derived from neuroblastoma cells with highrisk characteristics regardless of MYCN status.

neuroblastoma cell viability in vitro via suppressing
proliferation and preventing progression through cell

for the efficacy of the PLK1 inhibitor, GSK461364, against

PLK1 transcripts and protein [6]. PLK1 overexpression
is known to override the G2/M and spindle checkpoints
induced by DNA damage, thereby promoting chromosome
instability and aneuploidy and fostering cancer
progression [47]. We here show that inhibiting PLK1 with
GSK461364 effectively reverted these effects, causing
G2/M arrest accompanied by reduced proliferation and
apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. The expression profiling
we conducted with and without GSK461364 treatment
also indicated that PLK1 inhibition represses the E2F1

and E2F3 transcriptional activators, which promote
G1/S transition [48]. Interestingly, miR-34a, which acts
as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma, has also been
shown to downregulate E2F factors and is suggested to
directly suppress PLK1 translation [49–51]. Effects of
miR-34a are comparable to those caused by GSK461364
treatment here. E2F family deregulation especially occurs
in recurrent neuroblastomas and tumor-derived cell lines,
presumably caused by upregulation of factors, such as
CDK4, that inhibit the RB1 tumor suppressor [7, 52, 53].

Our analyses of signaling pathways associated with
oncogenesis, also showed that GSK461364 treatment
restored gene expression associated with unperturbed RB1
function. We conclude that PLK1 inhibition blocks cell
cycle progression in neuroblastic cells by blocking PLK1
canonical regulatory function at the G2/M transition as
well as cancer cell-specific blockage of G1/S transition
occurring presumably via de-repression of RB1-associated
gene expression.
Some genetic backgrounds have been proposed
to sensitize cancer cells to PLK1 inhibition. Gorlick and
colleagues treated a panel of predominantly MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell lines grown as xenograft
tumors in CB17SC scid−/− mice with the PLK1 inhibitor,
volasertib [54]. They observed a ≥2-fold increase in
the time to event in treated mice, and speculated that
the enhanced MYCN-driven cell cycle progression
might help sensitize neuroblastoma cells to agents that
block mitotic progression. In contrast, in our study also
GSK461364 treatment of neuroblastoma cells lacking
MYCN amplifications and expressing low levels of MYCN
significantly inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and
caused cell cycle arrest in in vitro, and significantly reduced
in vivo tumor growth of neuroblastoma cells independent
of MYCN copy number status. Degenhardt and colleagues
treated a panel of cell lines derived from adult cancers with
GSK461364A, and concluded that cancer cell sensitivity to
PLK1 inhibition is mediated by loss of TP53 functionality
[55]. TP53 is rarely mutated in neuroblastomas. However,
a TP53 variant (p53ΔC) lacking the nuclear localization
signal and part of the oligomerization domain [56], and
a truncated TP53 isoform (p53β) [57] being also present
in SK-N-AS cells, were reported for neuroblastoma. The
neuroblastoma cell lines tested here harbor both wildtype
or mutated TP53 (cf. Figure 1A), but were comparably
sensitive to low nanomolar GSK461364 concentrations. We
conclude that GSK461364 produces antineoplastic effects
in neuroblastoma cells independent of MYCN background
or TP53 functional status.
Targeted therapies can be circumvented by
resistance mechanisms developed by cancer cells during
tumor progression. Gilmartin and colleagues treated
mice bearing colorectal (Colo205) xenograft tumors with
several GSK461364A dosing schedules [35]. Xenograft
tumor volume was reduced by all schedules during
the treatment period, but resumed growth afterwards.
Antimitotic drugs either enhance antiapoptotic protein
expression to keep cell fractions alive during mitotic
arrest or act cytotoxically depending on cellular context
and inhibitor concentration [58, 59]. Cells in stasis might
resume proliferation after treatment. Overexpression of
the human multidrug resistance gene, ABCB1, was also
recently reported to reduce GSK461364 activity in cancer
cells [60]. Future in-depth preclinical studies addressing
whether neuroblastic tumors regrow after PLK1inhibiting treatment ceases and identifying the resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanisms involved should assist schedule refinement
for incorporating PLK1 inhibitors into current protocols
for high-risk or relapsed disease. Ferrarotto and colleagues
recently observed different sensitivities of cancer cell lines
comparing treatments with dihydropteridinone derivatives,
BI2536 or volasertib, with GSK461364 [34]. They
suggested that higher sensitivity to GSK461364 might
result from increased PLK1 selectivity of this compound
compared to the two other inhibitors. It remains to be
further elucidated if one class of PLK1 inhibitors might be
substituted by another in case of resistance. To minimize
resistance development, PLK1 inhibitors will most likely
be combined with other synergizing targeted agents or
conventional chemotherapeutics in treatment regimens.
To date, synergism has especially been shown for PLK1inhibitor based combination therapies with microtubuleinterfering drugs (e.g. vincristine) [30, 61–63]. In contrast,
the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib showed antagonistic effects
when combined with etoposide in a cell line panel of
pediatric malignancies [30].
Here we explored the feasibility of treating high-risk
neuroblastoma patients with GSK461364 in preclinical
models. GSK461364 suppressed proliferation, induced
apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in neuroblastoma
cell lines in vitro, and reduced tumor growth and extended
survival of mice bearing xenografts of cell lines derived from
high-risk neuroblastomas. Our data suggest that GSK461364
has the potential to generate a measurable response in
patients with high-risk neuroblastomas and might even be
considered for rational combination treatment approaches
[31]. GSK461364 should, therefore, be considered for entry
into early phase clinical trials in pediatric patients.

into the left flank of 8-week-old female athymic nu/
nu mice (n = 12 mice). Mice were randomly assigned
(6 mice per group) to either GSK461364 or vehicle
(0.1% DMSO, 5% glucose) control groups after tumors
reached 200 mm3. Vehicle control or 50 mg GSK461364
per kg body weight was intraperitoneally injected every
second day until all control mice reached the endpoint
(tumor volume of 2,500mm3) but not longer than 40
days. The same dose and treatment scheme was chosen
as used in previous preclinical GSK461364 studies
in various xenograft tumor models, and which was
shown to be safe and effective [35]. Tumor growth
was monitored using a caliper, and tumor volume
was calculated using the formula, (breadth × length ×
height)/2. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation
when tumor size exceeded 2,500mm3. In mice, whose
xenograft tumors were to be immunohistologically
examined for apoptosis and proliferation, 2 doses
of 100 mg GSK461364 per kg body weight were
administered every 12 hours over a 3-day course (n = 3
mice in both GSK461364 and vehicle control groups).
Mice were euthanized 4 hours after the last treatment
injection, and xenograft tumors were excised, formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded. All animal experiments
were performed in accordance with the Council of
Europe guidelines for accommodation and care of
laboratory animals, and protocols were approved by the
Ethical Commission for Animal Experimentation at the
University Hospital Essen.

Neuroblastoma cell lines were seeded onto 96-well
plates (2 × 103 cells per well) in triplicate for all assays,
and incubated for 24 hours to permit surface adherence.
Viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Apoptosis and proliferation were
assessed using the Cell Death and BrdU ELISAs (Roche),
respectively. All assays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. For cell cycle analysis, SK-NAS and IMR32 cells were suspended by trypsinization and
washed 3 times with PBS, then incubated with propidium
iodide for 15 min to stain DNA. Cellular DNA content
was analyzed using a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). Colony forming ability was
assessed in SK-N-AS or IMR32 cells by staining colonies
with 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 45 minutes, washed twice with
PBS and colonies were counted. All experiments were
independently performed in triplicates at least 3 times, if

SK-N-AS cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (1 x
105 cells/well), allowed 12 hours to adhere then incubated
24 hours with 500 nM GSK461364 or control medium
(containing 0.1% DMSO). Total RNA was extracted
using the RNeasyMini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany),
and samples were profiled on the Affymetrix Human
Gene Expression Array (HG-U133 Plus 2.0, Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA), both according to manufacturers’
protocols. CEL files were normalized and summarized to
gene levels to conduct gcRMA normalization from the
Bioconductor repository of statistical tools [64]. Only
probes with the highest mean expression for each gene and
with a log2 expression >5 were included in the analysis
for differential expression using the Rank Product analysis
package v2.36.0 in R [65]. Samples were clustered using
hierarchical clustering, and dissimilarity calculated using
Manhattan distances. Gene set enrichment analysis was
performed using GSEA v2.0 software (www. broadinstitute.
org/gsea) [66]. Genes were ranked by calculating the
difference in population means scaled by the standard
deviation to generate a signal to noise ranking metric.
We used publicly available curated gene sets (c2.all.
v4.0.symbols.gmt), gene motif sets (c3.all.v4.0.symbols.
gmt) and oncogenic signatures (c6.all.v4.0.symbols.gmt)
in our analyses. Newly generated microarray data were
deposited in the GEO database (accession no. GSE67102).

Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
(5 µm) were deparaffinized using routine techniques, and
placed in 200 ml of EnVision™ target retrieval solution
(pH 6.0; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 20 minutes
at 100°C. After cooling for 20 minutes, slides were
quenched with 3% H2O2 for 5 minutes before incubating
with primary antibodies against cleaved caspase 3 (#cat
9661; 1:200; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) to
detect apoptotic cells or marker of proliferation Ki-67
(#cat M724029-2, 1:25, Dako) using a Dako Autostainer
(Dakocytomation). Immunostaining was visualized using
the EnVision™+ kit (Dako).

Statistics
Pairs of interval variables were compared with
Student’s two-sided t-tests using SPSS Statistics for
Windows, v21.0. (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Error bars
in figures represent standard deviation. Graph Pad Prism
5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was
used to calculate GI50 or 80 concentrations and to perform
Kaplan-Meier analyses.

Xenograft model
SK-N-AS and IMR32 neuroblastoma cells were
cultured to 80% confluency, harvested and suspended
