ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and second-most lethal cancer
among men in the United States. The vast majority of prostate cancer deaths are due
to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) – the lethal form of the disease that
has progressed despite therapies that interfere with activation of androgen receptor
(AR) signaling. One emergent resistance mechanism to medical castration is synthesis
of intratumoral androgens that activate the AR. This insight led to the development
of the AR antagonist enzalutamide. However, resistance to enzalutamide invariably
develops, and disease progression is nearly universal. One mechanism of resistance to
enzalutamide is an F877L mutation in the AR ligand-binding domain that can convert
enzalutamide to an agonist of AR activity. However, mechanisms that contribute
to the agonist switch had not been fully clarified, and there were no therapies to
block AR F877L. Using cell line models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),
we determined that cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of
mutant F877L AR. Further, enzalutamide treatment of AR F877L-expressing cell
lines recapitulated the effects of androgen activation of F877L AR or wild-type AR.
Because the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 was previously shown to block androgen
activation of wild-type AR, we tested JQ-1 in AR F877L-expressing CRPC models. We
determined that JQ-1 suppressed androgen or enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L
AR and suppressed growth of mutant F877L AR CRPC tumors in vivo, demonstrating
a new strategy to treat tumors harboring this mutation.

capable of synthesizing their own androgens and that these
intratumoral androgen levels are sufficient to maintain AR
function [2, 3]. These discoveries led to the development
of the second generation anti-androgen enzalutamide that
suppresses CRPC tumor growth in pre-clinical models
[4]. Recently, two phase III clinical trials demonstrated
a significant overall survival benefit with enzalutamide
treatment vs. placebo, leading to enzalutamide’s approval
for CRPC patients [5, 6]. However, many patients do

not respond to enzalutamide treatment, and disease
progression is nearly universal. Thus, understanding
mechanisms that contribute to enzalutamide resistance is
crucial for the development of more effective treatment
strategies.
Previously, several groups identified mutations
in the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) that convert
first-generation anti-androgens such as bicalutamide
and flutamide to AR agonists rather than antagonists [7,
8]. Clinically, discontinuation of these first-generation
anti-androgens leads to so-called “anti-androgen
withdrawal” effects (PSA declines) in as many as 25%
of patients [9]. Several groups have detected F877L
mutations (alternatively described as F876L based on
older genomic builds) in the AR LBD following chronic
treatment of prostate cancer cell lines with enzalutamide
or other second-generation anti-androgens such as ARN509 [10–12]. AR F877L mutations confer resistance to
enzalutamide treatment and have been shown to cause
an antagonist to agonist switch in some cases [10–
12]. Approximately 5-10% of patients harbor F877L
mutations after treatment with novel anti-androgens
such as enzalutamide or ARN-509, demonstrating the
clinical relevance of this mutation [11, 13]. However,
anti-androgen withdrawal effects after discontinuing
enzalutamide are only observed in a small percentage of
patients [14]. Mechanisms that contribute to enzalutamide
agonism of AR function are not fully understood, and it
is not clear why enzalutamide anti-androgen withdrawal
effects are rarely observed in the clinic. Further, there
are currently no effective treatments to suppress mutant
F877L AR function.
In this study, we used cellular models to identify
molecular mechanisms that contribute to enzalutamide
agonism of mutant F877L AR. We determined that
enzalutamide treatment of AR F877L-expressing cells
led to greater agonistic effects when the cells were
cultured in conditions with low androgen ligands.
This suggests that the androgen content of the cell
may determine whether enzalutamide has the capacity
to activate mutant F877L AR. Further, we found that
enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR leads to
induction of a similar, albeit smaller, set of genes that are
activated by the natural AR ligand dihydrotestosterone
(DHT). This suggests that DHT is a more potent
activator of AR function.
Finally, prior work showed that inhibition of the
BET bromodomain family of chromatin readers is an
effective strategy to suppress androgen ligand activation of
wild-type AR [15]. We determined that BET bromodomain
inhibition also interferes with either androgen or
enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR and
suppresses CRPC cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
BET bromodomain inhibition is a promising strategy to
block AR F877L function irrespective of whether the AR
ligand is androgens or enzalutamide.

Androgens influence enzalutamide agonism of
mutant F877L AR
In order to study the problem of acquired
enzalutamide resistance, several groups have chronically
treated prostate cancer cell lines in vitro or in vivo with
enzalutamide. One example is the MR49F cell line that
was derived after LNCaP cells were implanted in castrated
mice and treated chronically with enzalutamide [16, 17].
MR49F cells have been previously found to contain an AR
F877L mutation [18] and a nearly full copy number gain
of the AR versus their parental LNCaP CRPC derivative
cell line called V16D [19]. To confirm the mutational
status of these cell lines, we used PCR to amplify a 624
bp region encoding the AR LBD in both MR49F and
V16D cells and then performed Sanger sequencing on
the products. Sequencing confirmed a T→C mutation
corresponding to the mutant F877L AR in MR49F
cells but not in the parental V16D line (Figure 1A). To
determine if background observed in the V16D sequencing
trace (Figure 1A) was due to this mutation being present at
low frequency in the parental V16D cells, we performed
a restriction digest on the PCR products. The T→C base
pair change that corresponds to the F877L mutation results
in the generation of an MwoI restriction site. No digestion
with MwoI was observed in the PCR products amplified
from V16D cells (Figure 1B). On the other hand, MwoI
digestion of the PCR product amplified from MR49F cells
led to digestion products of 489 and 187 base pairs (bp).
The presence of the upper, undigested 624 bp band in the
MR49F PCR product indicates that the F877L mutation in
MR49F cells is heterozygous (Figure 1B). Overall, these
results demonstrate that the AR F877L mutation is not
readily identifiable in parental V16D cells and suggests
that this mutation may be acquired with enzalutamide
resistance, which matches prior reports [10, 11].
Next, we cultured V16D cells or MR49F cells in
growth media supplemented with fetal bovine serum
(FBS). Importantly, prostate cancer cells are capable
of metabolizing the testosterone found in FBS into
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at concentrations similar to
those found in CRPC tumors (~1–10 nM) that promote AR
function and CRPC growth [20, 21]. We treated both of
these cell lines with enzalutamide (10 μM) and measured
cell viability. Enzalutamide treatment reduced viability of
V16D cells but did not change viability of MR49F cells
(Figure 1C). Importantly, while the MR49F cells were
resistant to treatment, we observed no agonistic effect
on cell growth despite the fact that MR49F cells harbor
an AR F877L mutation (Figure 1C). We then measured
the effect of enzalutamide treatment on canonical AR
target genes in V16D and MR49F cells. Enzalutamide
treatment suppressed expression of KLK3 and TMPRSS2
in V16D cells (Figure 1D). However, enzalutamide

treatment of MR49F cells did not lead to significant
changes in expression of these genes. Importantly, no
significant agonistic effects on gene expression were seen
(Figure 1D).
To more globally examine the effect of enzalutamide
on gene expression, we performed RNA-seq on MR49F
or V16D cells treated with vehicle or enzalutamide.
Enzalutamide treatment of V16D cells led to 478

differentially-expressed genes (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure S1A, also see Supplementary Gene Lists
corresponding to these figures); gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) showed significant enrichment for
a signature of canonical AR target genes described
previously [15] (Supplementary Figure S2A, also see
Supplementary Gene List corresponding to this figure).
On the other hand, enzalutamide treatment of MR49F

expression (Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure S4A). On
the other hand, enzalutamide treatment of LNCaP-F877L
cells grown in androgen-depleted, charcoal-stripped
serum led to a much greater induction of GFP expression
(Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure S4A). This matches
the results in MR49F cells. As expected, enzalutamide did
not activate GFP expression in LNCaP cells with stable
overexpression of wild-type AR and the Pb. EGFP reporter
(Supplementary Figure S4B).

cells only resulted in seven differentially-expressed
genes (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure S1B, also see
Supplementary Gene Lists corresponding to these figures).
In examining the RNA-seq data for AR transcripts, we
determined that 61% of the MR49F RNA-seq reads
mapping to the AR LBD contained the cytosine nucleotide
corresponding to the F877L mutation while the remainder
corresponded to the wild-type allele. Conversely, the wildtype allele was observed in 100% of reads in V16D cells.
This confirms results in Figure 1 that the F877L mutation
is heterozygous in MR49F cells and that this mutation is
either not present or is very rare in the parental V16D line.
Overall, the above results demonstrate that enzalutamide
does not confer a growth advantage or activate AR
transcriptional activity when AR F877L-expressing cells
are cultured with androgen levels similar to CRPC tumors.
To confirm that MR49F cells were still ARdependent, we grew these cells in FBS supplemented
with enzalutamide and then suppressed AR with RNAi.
AR knockdown significantly decreased cell viability and
expression of AR target genes (Supplementary Figure S3).
These data demonstrate a continued dependence of AR in
enzalutamide-resistant MR49F cells despite enzalutamide
treatment.
Because of these results, we hypothesized that
androgens may compete for enzalutamide activation
of mutant F877L AR. Therefore, we cultured MR49F
cells in androgen-depleted conditions using medium
supplemented with charcoal-stripped FBS, which contains
~80% less total testosterone than medium supplemented
with standard FBS [20]. We then added either vehicle, 1
nM DHT (based on prior reports that this level of DHT
is commonly found in CRPC metastases) [21], 10 μM
enzalutamide, or both in combination. DHT increased
cell growth as expected (Figure 2A). Enzalutamide
alone also increased cell growth under these androgendepleted conditions (Figure 2A). The combination of
DHT and enzalutamide also increased cell growth,
though this effect was attenuated compared to DHT alone
(Figure 2A). Further, DHT alone, enzalutamide alone,
or the combination in androgen-depleted conditions also
increased expression of canonical AR targets: KLK3,
TMPRSS2, and NKX3.1 (Figure 2B) and increased protein
levels of PSA encoded by the KLK3 gene (Figure 2C).
This suggests that the cellular androgen content influences
enzalutamide’s ability to activate mutant F877L AR.
To determine if the effect of androgen content
on enzalutamide agonism of F877L was generalizable,
we used LNCaP cells stably overexpressing F877L AR
and also an AR-driven probasin promoter GFP reporter
construct (LNCaP Pb. EGFP ARF877L, also known as
LNCaP-F877L) [12]. We treated cells with enzalutamide
or DHT and then performed flow cytometry to quantify
GFP expression. Enzalutamide treatment of LNCaPF877L cells cultured in androgen-replete serum led to a
modest induction of AR function as measured by GFP

Gene expression changes induced by
enzalutamide overlap with those induced
by DHT
To more globally examine the effects of DHT
or enzalutamide on F877L AR activation, we grew
MR49F cells in charcoal-stripped serum, treated the
cells with vehicle, 10 μM enzalutamide, or 1 nM DHT,
and then performed RNA-seq. Under androgen-depleted
conditions, enzalutamide treatment led to 396 significantly
differentially expressed genes compared to vehicle
treatment. DHT treatment, on the other hand, induced
expression changes in 2048 genes, again suggesting
that DHT is a more potent agonist than enzalutamide
in MR49F cells at the concentrations tested. Both the
DHT- and enzalutamide-activated gene sets showed
significant enrichment for the aforementioned signature
of canonical AR target genes (Supplementary Figure S2B,
S2C, also see Supplementary Gene List corresponding
to this figure) [15]. This demonstrates that enzalutamide
or DHT activation of mutant F877L AR upregulates a
transcriptional program similar to wild-type AR.
We next sought to determine whether there was
significant overlap between the differentially expressed
genes after either DHT or enzalutamide treatment in
MR49F cells. Of the 396 genes that were differentially
expressed with enzalutamide treatment, 358 were also
differentially-expressed with DHT treatment (Figure 2E,
also see Supplementary Gene Lists corresponding to this
figure), demonstrating that enzalutamide activates many of
the same AR target genes as natural AR ligands in F877L
AR-expressing cells. Furthermore, because of the much
greater number of gene expression changes seen with
enzalutamide in androgen-depleted conditions (Figure 2E)
vs. androgen-replete conditions (Figure 1E), these results
further suggest that the androgen content of the cell is a
key determinant of enzalutamide’s capacity to act as an
agonist of mutant F877L AR.

activation of mutant F877L AR and suppresses

There are currently no effective treatments to
disrupt mutant F877L AR function. We determined that

concentration of JQ-1 was required to reduce cell viability
in MR49F cells grown in androgen-depleted serum vs.
androgen-replete serum (Supplementary Figure S5). This is
in keeping with a prior report that suggests that suppression
of ligand-dependent AR signaling is a critical contributor to
the anti-tumor activity of JQ-1 in prostate cancer cells [15].

recapitulates activation of wild-type AR (Supplementary

strategies that were previously shown to block androgen
activation of wild-type AR transcriptional activation.

ligand-induced activation of wild-type AR [15]. Therefore,

previously described AR signature in these 57 genes (p
≤ 6.14 x 10-9) [15]. Furthermore, many of the same gene
ontology (GO) categories were enriched in the 358 conserved
genes after DHT or enzalutamide treatment and in the 57
genes changed most by JQ-1 treatment, demonstrating that
JQ-1 blocks enzalutamide or DHT activation of AR function
in mutant F877L AR-expressing cells (Supplementary Tables
S1 & S2).
MR49F cells harbor both non-mutant and mutant
F877L AR alleles. To determine if the JQ-1 treatment
effect was independent of effects on wild-type AR, we
transfected AR-null PC3 cells with ectopic mutant F877L
AR and an ARE4 luciferase reporter of AR function, and
then treated them with DHT or enzalutamide +/- JQ-1
[23, 24]. JQ-1 partially abrogated the effects of DHT or
enzalutamide on AR reporter activation, demonstrating
that JQ-1 blocks F877L function even in the absence of
wild-type AR (Figure 3E).
Finally, we sought to determine the tolerability
and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of JQ-1 in an F877L
CRPC model in vivo. Prior work demonstrated that

enzalutamide treatment of MR49F xenografts implanted
in castrated mice leads to agonistic growth compared
to vehicle treatment [25]. Since this agonist effect was
already known, we designed a streamlined, two-armed
study to determine if JQ-1 could block enzalutamideinduced growth of MR49F xenografts. We implanted
MR49F cells in castrated mice and compared the effect
of treatment with enzalutamide alone or enzalutamide
+ JQ-1. Xenografts grew robustly in mice treated with
enzalutamide alone as expected, while enzalutamide +
JQ-1 treatment significantly reduced this growth (Figure
4A-4C). There were no differences in animals’ weights
between the groups (Figure 4D), and no organ toxicity was
observed upon visual inspection with the combination,
demonstrating the preliminary safety and activity of this
combination. Altogether, these results demonstrate that
BET bromodomain inhibition interferes with androgen
or enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR and that
BET bromodomain inhibition is a promising therapy to
block the growth of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC tumors
harboring this mutation.

DISCUSSION

Our data shed new light on molecular mechanisms
that contribute to mutant F877L AR activation by
enzalutamide. While cells expressing the F877L mutation
are resistant to enzalutamide, the enzalutamide agonistic
effect on F877L AR is correlated with cellular androgen
content. Indeed, we found that enzalutamide treatment of
F877L-expressing MR49F cells only enhanced cell growth
under low androgen conditions (charcoal-stripped serum).
Furthermore, enzalutamide activates a transcriptional
program that strongly overlaps with that activated by
DHT, but induction of this program only occurred when
androgens were depleted from culture. The effect of
androgen interference with enzalutamide agonism was
confirmed in an additional model – LNCaP cells with
ectopic overexpression of F877L.
One explanation for the lack of enzalutamide
agonism in androgen-replete conditions is that
enzalutamide activation of mutant F877L AR is cancelled
out by suppression of wild-type AR. Another possible
explanation is that, in androgen-replete conditions,
androgen ligands compete with enzalutamide for binding
and activation of mutant F877L AR, thereby diminishing
agonistic effects of enzalutamide. Indeed, a recent report
demonstrates that intratumoral androgens persist or may
increase in enzalutamide-resistant tumors [42]. Our data
using both MR49F cells and PC3 cells grown in androgendepleted conditions demonstrate that DHT concentrations
similar to those achievable in human CRPC [21, 43] are
better activators of mutant F877L AR than enzalutamide,
further supporting our hypothesis that androgens compete
for F877L AR activation.
In this study, we also measured the global gene
expression change induced by DHT or enzalutamide
treatment in F877L AR-expressing cells. DHT treatment
induced a greater number of gene expression changes
versus enzalutamide treatment, and the magnitude of gene
expression change for nearly all genes was also greater
with DHT vs. enzalutamide treatment. This further
demonstrates that DHT may more potently activate F877L
AR than enzalutamide.
Importantly, while DHT induced many unique
gene expression changes vs. enzalutamide, nearly all
the gene expression changes induced by enzalutamide
were shared with DHT treatment. This demonstrates that
enzalutamide agonism of F877L AR does not activate a
distinct gene expression program vs. DHT. Further, there
was a strong enrichment for a signature of canonical wildtype AR signaling [15] with either DHT or enzalutamide
stimulation of MR49F cells, demonstrating that mutant
F877L AR does not direct a distinct transcriptional
program from wild-type AR.
Inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins was
shown previously to block wild-type AR activation by
androgens [15]. BET bromodomain proteins are chromatin
readers that recognize acetyl lysine residues on histone
tails and promote transcription of important genes in

Despite medical castration, CRPCs are still
dependent on the AR [26]. AR amplification is a common
feature of CRPC, and upregulation of the androgen
synthetic machinery is an emergent resistance mechanism
in CRPC tumor cells to overcome androgen deprivation
therapies [2, 3]. In recent years, drugs that interfere with
these persistent intratumoral androgens have emerged
as an effective strategy to combat CRPC. Abiraterone
suppresses synthesis of androgens from the adrenal gland
and tumor cells via CYP17 inhibition [27–29] and has
also been found to interfere directly with ligand binding
to the AR [30]. The second-generation anti-androgen
enzalutamide competitively inhibits binding of ligands to
AR [29, 31]. These drugs improved median survival for
CRPC patients in phase III clinical trials [5, 6, 32, 33].
However, resistance to these drugs invariably develops.
One mechanism of resistance to newer AR-targeting
agents is the expression of AR splice variants that lack
the LBD entirely and promote ligand-independent growth
[34]. In particular, AR-V7 expression in circulating tumor
cells has been found in 19% and 39% of abiraterone and
enzalutamide-treated patients, respectively [35]. AR-V7
expression in these patients has been associated with
resistance to these agents [35].
While not as common as AR-V7 induction, point
mutations that result in functional changes to the AR LBD
are another mechanism of resistance to anti-androgen
treatment strategies [36]. Examples of these mutations
resulting in single amino acid changes are: H874Y, T877A,
T877S, and W741L [36–38]. Recently, F877L mutations
in the AR LBD have been described and are associated
with enzalutamide resistance in both pre-clinical [10–12]
models and clinical studies [11]. F877L mutations are
also detected in a clinically-relevant number (5-10%) of
enzalutamide-resistant patients [11, 13].
The F877L mutation results in a conformational
change to the AR LBD [10] that abolishes the
antagonist effect of enzalutamide. Further, under some
circumstances, enzalutamide acts as an agonist on the
mutant F877L AR [10]. Prior reports demonstrate that
cessation of first-generation anti-androgens leads to
anti-androgen withdrawal effects in as many as 25% of
patients [9, 39–41]. However, anti-androgen withdrawal
effects after discontinuing enzalutamide are only seen in a
small percentage of patients, though the F877L mutation
status of patients in that study was not reported [14].
Cohorts for whom AR mutational status is available in
addition to PSA data after discontinuing enzalutamide
will be necessary to understand clinically whether
enzalutamide discontinuation can lead to an anti-androgen
withdrawal effect like that seen with other anti-androgens.
Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of determinants of
the antagonist-to-agonist switch is critical for developing
new treatments to target AR F877L mutations.

cancer, such as c-Myc and others, by cooperating with
transcription factors, including: AR, the estrogen receptor,
GATA1, and p53 [15, 22, 44–47]. Treatment with
the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 interferes with
ligand-induced activation of wild-type AR and blocks
CRPC cell survival [15]. For this reason, we tested the
BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ-1 in mutant F877L ARexpressing models. JQ-1 co-treatment blocked either
DHT or enzalutamide-induced growth of MR49F cells
and also blocked induction of AR target gene expression
(Figure 3D, Supplementary Table S2). We also confirmed
this effect in cells that only expressed mutant F877L AR,
demonstrating that JQ-1 is an effective treatment to block
F877L AR activation even in the absence of wild-type AR
(Figure 3E).
Prior work demonstrated that AR-dependent cell
lines are more susceptible to JQ-1 treatment than ARnull cell lines, suggesting that AR is a critical BET
bromodomain inhibitor target in CRPC. [15]. We found
that suppression of cell viability by JQ-1 was much greater
under androgen-replete conditions compared to androgendepleted conditions (Supplementary Figure S5). Thus,
our results further confirm that suppression of liganddependent AR function is a key determinant of the antitumor activity of JQ-1 in CRPC models.
We also measured the effect of JQ-1 on growth of
MR49F xenografts implanted in castrated mice in vivo.
We determined that JQ-1 co-treatment with enzalutamide
blocked tumor growth vs. enzalutamide treatment alone.
Body weights were similar between the two treatment
arms, and we did not observe any additional toxicity
with JQ-1 + enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide alone. This
further demonstrates the potential of BET bromodomain
inhibition for the treatment of F877L AR-expressing
CRPC tumors and the preliminary safety of combining
BET bromodomain inhibitors with enzalutamide.
Altogether, our data demonstrate that the androgen
content of the CRPC cell influences enzalutamide’s
ability to activate mutant F877L AR and suggest that
enzalutamide agonism may be more pronounced in tumors
harboring F877L mutations that have the lowest androgen
concentrations. Finally, our results demonstrate that BET
bromodomain inhibition is a promising treatment to
block mutant F877L AR, irrespective of whether the AR
ligand is androgens or enzalutamide. Clinical trials with
BET bromodomain inhibition in CRPC that have recently
begun (NCT02711956) will be necessary to confirm these
results.

empty control vector were a kind gift from Dr. Charles
Sawyers [12]. All cells were maintained in RPMI1640
with 10% fetal bovine serum. Additionally, MR49F cells
were maintained in media with 10 μM enzalutamide.

Drug treatments
Enzalutamide was obtained from MedchemExpress
(HY-70002). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was obtained
from Sigma (A8380). For in vitro experiments, JQ-1
was obtained from BPS Bioscience (27402). For in
vivo studies, JQ-1 was obtained from the laboratory
of Dr. James Bradner, Dana Farber Cancer Institute
Dept. of Medical Oncology/Harvard Medical School
Dept. of Medicine. For in vitro studies, DMSO stocks
of enzalutamide and JQ-1 and ethanol stocks of DHT
were diluted to desired working concentrations in cell
culture media (RPMI with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal
bovine serum unless otherwise noted) with a final vehicle
concentration of 0.1%. Vehicle-only controls were used
in all cases, and vehicle concentrations were normalized
across all drug co-treatments. See below for information
on administration of drugs for in vivo studies.

In vivo studies
MR49F xenografts were implanted in 7-8 week
old castrated, immunocompromised male mice (Athymic
Nude-Foxn1nu, Harlan Laboratories, strain code 069).
Once tumors reached 100mm3, groups of mice were
randomized to treatment with DMSO or JQ-1 (50 mg/kg)
by intraperitoneal injection Monday through Friday. All
animals were treated with enzalutamide (10 mg/kg) by oral
gavage Monday through Friday. Tumor measurements and
body weight measurements were recorded, and all animals
were sacrificed on Day 28. Tumor volumes and final body
weights are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). 2-sided t-test with equal variance was performed
using end point (week 4) data. Differential tumor wet
weights at sacrifice between treatment groups was tested
using a 2-sided 2-sample t-test with Welch's correction,
as the distribution appeared to be approximately normal.
P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Mice were housed under specific pathogenfree conditions (5 mice per shoebox cage) and maintained
by the OHSU Department of Comparative Medicine. All
in vivo studies were conducted under an OHSU IACUCapproved protocol (protocol #IS00003757).

50]. Transcript assembly and quantification was done
with Cufflinks v2.1.1 [50, 51] or HTSeq v0.6.1 [52]. For
genes with multiple transcripts, the estimates of transcript
expression were summed to yield a single estimate of
gene-level expression in FPKM units. Sequence data are
available at Gene Expression Omnibus with accession
number GSE69896.
To identify genes that were differentially-expressed
compared to mock treatment, data was first filtered to
remove genes with low variation across the sample set. For
each cell line, we used a t-test on the filtered normalized
expression values to identify genes whose expression was
significantly changed by drug treatment (enzalutamide,
DHT, and/or JQ-1). We used Benjamini-Hochberg false
discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons, and
deemed genes with q < 0.05 to be significant. Statistical
analyses were performed in R (version 3.1.2) and
displayed in RStudio (version 0.98.501).
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [53] was
run using RNA-seq gene expression data from triplicate
cell line samples treated with vehicle or drug. Specifically,
the expression data were interrogated for enrichment in
the gene set of interest: an AR expression signature
described previously [15]. The expression data were
permutated 1000 times to generate the resulting GSEA
plots, normalized enrichment scores, and FDR q-values
(Supplementary Figure S2).
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and functional
annotation was performed on the 358 genes concordantly
differentially expressed with enzalutamide and DHT
treatment from Figure 2E, and the 57 shared enzalutamide
and DHT-regulated genes from Figure 3A whose
expression is significantly reversed (≥2 fold) by JQ-1
using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID, v6.7). Specifically, the
genes of interest were examined against Gene Ontology
Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular
Component curated gene sets (levels 4 and 5), and
Biocarta, Kegg, Reactome, Panther and the Biological
Biochemical Image pathway databases.

Cells were lysed using Trizol reagent (Life
Technologies), and RNA was isolated using chloroform
extraction and alcohol precipitation per manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA concentration was determined using
a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. 1.0 μg RNA
was reverse-transcribed using a High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies) with
random primers. RT-qPCR was performed using a 7500
Fast thermocycler (Life Technologies) with the following
cycling program: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min, 40
cycles of 95°C for 15 sec dissociation, 60°C for 1 min
annealing/extension/read. 10 μL singleplex RT-qPCR
reactions contained 1X TaqMan (Life Technologies)
universal standard Master Mix, 1X TaqMan hydrolysis
probe, and 10 ng RNA-equivalent cDNA template.
TaqMan probes were used to detect human KLK3
(Hs02576345_m1), TMPRSS2 (Hs01120965_m1),
NKX3.1 (Hs00171834_m1). Human β-actin TaqMan probe
(Hs99999903_m1) was used as an endogenous control.
RT-qPCR raw Ct data were analyzed with 7500 Software
v2.0.5 and DataAssist Software v3.0 (Life Technologies).

RNA-seq library preparation and expression
analysis
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol/CHCl3 (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Two wells were combined for each replicate for RNA
extraction in 1 mL Trizol, and the aqueous phase was
put through the Qiagen RNEasy kit for cleanup. Sample
preparation followed the Agilent SureSelect StrandSpecific mRNA Library Preparation Protocol (Version
A.2, September 2013, Agilent Technologies). Poly-A RNA
was purified from 1 μg total RNA per sample using two
serial rounds of binding to oligo dT magnetic beads. The
poly(A) RNA was chemically-fragmented, and first-stand
cDNA was synthesized using the RNA-seq First Strand
Master Mix (Agilent). After purifying the first strand
cDNA using AMPure XP beads, second-strand cDNA
was synthesized and ends were repaired. A second round
of cDNA purification with AMPure XP beads occurred,
and the 3’ ends were adenylated, followed by adapter
ligation and AMPure XP beads purification. Ligated DNA
was PCR-amplified for 14 cycles and purified again with
AMPure XP beads. Quality of the resulting libraries was
assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000
Assay. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq as
single-end 50 bp reads in the OHSU Massively Parallel
Sequencing Shared Resource.
RNA-seq was conducted on three biological
replicates of each cell line/drug treatment. RNA-seq data
analysis was performed using the Tuxedo Suite [49–51].
