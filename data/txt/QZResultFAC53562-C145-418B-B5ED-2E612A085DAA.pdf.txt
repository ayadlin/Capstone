BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend lifelong anticoagulation in patients with cancer and a history of thromboembolism, but the use of anticoagulation in hospice has not been described. A retrospective study of medication data
was conducted to determine patterns of anticoagulant use and predictors of type of anticoagulant prescribed for
hospice patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Medication data were evaluated for 16,896 hospice patients with lung
cancer in 2006 to determine patient and hospice characteristics that predicted anticoagulant prescription. Independent predictors of warfarin versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prescription were identified using a logistic
regression model. RESULTS: One of every 11 patients was prescribed an anticoagulant, most commonly warfarin.
Compared with patients prescribed LMWH, patients prescribed warfarin were older (71.6 vs 65.8 years, P<.001), were
more likely white (81.2% vs 74.3%, P ¼ .03), had a longer stay in hospice (median 21 days vs 17 days, P ¼ .001), and
were more likely to have 3 comorbid illnesses (37.5% vs 25.0%, P<.001). The strongest independent predictor of
type of anticoagulant prescribed was geographic region, with hospices in the Northeast more likely to prescribe
LMWH. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant use is prevalent in patients with lung cancer enrolled in hospice. This study
highlights the need to understand the benefits and risks of anticoagulation at the end of life. Cancer 2010;116:4817–

KEYWORDS: anticoagulants, hospice care, drug interactions, neoplasms, thromboembolism.

Patients with advanced cancer enrolled in hospice are at high risk of venous thromboembolism, usually because of

older age, advanced or metastatic disease, and decreased mobility.1 Approximately 10% of patients with cancer who are
treated in palliative care units are diagnosed with symptomatic thromboembolism,2 and more than half of patients in
inpatient hospice units are believed to have asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis.3
Guidelines advocate lifelong anticoagulation in patients with current thromboembolism or a history of thromboembolism and active cancer.4-6 Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred over warfarin because of evidence
of the superiority of LMWH in preventing recurrent thromboembolic disease in patients with cancer.7
Guidelines for the use of anticoagulants in cancer suggest benefit in select patients receiving palliative care.5 A proposed benefit of anticoagulation in hospice care, where the goal is promoting quality of life rather than lengthening survival, is that treatment may reduce bothersome symptoms of thromboembolism such as pain, edema, and dyspnea.1
However, no studies of adequate size have been conducted to definitively determine the effect of anticoagulation on symptoms or survival in hospice patients.8
The use of anticoagulants in the context of palliative care is challenging for several reasons: 1) the unknown effect on
quality of life; 2) uncertain risk of discontinuing anticoagulation; 3) risk of bleeding, which is increased with renal failure
and malnutrition; 4) numerous drug interactions with warfarin; 5) high burden associated with more intense patient monitoring; and 6) direct and indirect costs that strain patients and hospice providers who are reimbursed by a fixed hospice

benefit.9 Although palliative care practitioners and
patients are increasingly accepting of anticoagulation in
theory,10,11 to our knowledge, actual anticoagulant use at
the end of life has not been described previously.
The purpose of this study was to determine patterns
of anticoagulant use and the predictors of the type of anticoagulant prescribed for hospice patients with lung cancer.
We chose to evaluate patients with lung cancer because
they make up the largest group with cancer who enroll in
hospice annually and have a high risk of venous thromboembolism, increased 4-fold in metastatic disease.12,13

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Source of Data
Data for this study were obtained from excelleRx, operating as Hospice Pharmacia, a national hospice pharmacy
provider that manages medication therapy for >800 hospice organizations in the United States. Patients served by
Hospice Pharmacia are similar in demographic and clinical characteristics to samples from the National Hospice
and Palliative Care Organization as well as the National
Home and Hospice Care Survey.14 Data from this provider have been described in more detail elsewhere.14,15
We obtained data on medication use for 65,106 persons
with a terminal diagnosis of cancer who enrolled in hospice and died during the period of January 1, 2006,
through December 31, 2006. Demographic and clinical
data, including primary diagnosis and other medical conditions, were collected by hospice staff at admission into
hospice care. Medication data were collected by hospice
staff as part of routine clinical care and reported to the
hospice pharmacy provider during encounters between
hospice staff and pharmacy staff.
Our target population included patients with lung
cancer who received hospice care in the home. We
excluded patients who received hospice care in long-term
care and assisted living settings or inpatient palliative care
units (n ¼ 10,340) because of known inconsistencies in
medication data reporting. We also excluded patients
with cancers other than lung cancer (n ¼ 37,815). In
addition, 1 patient with missing medication data and 54
patients with incomplete hospice data were excluded. Our
study sample was comprised of 16,896 patients with lung
cancer who received hospice care in the home. The derivation of the study sample is shown in Figure 1.
This study was approved by The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center’s institutional review
board with waiver of informed consent.

Measures
Patient and hospice variables were evaluated to predict the
frequency of warfarin versus LMWH prescription. Patient
variables included age, sex, race, length of stay in hospice,
number of medications, and comorbid illnesses. Comorbid illnesses were derived from the indications for each
medication as coded by Hospice Pharmacia staff, and
were only included for analysis if the diagnosis was
included in Elixhauser’s method.16 Hospice variables
included zip codes (to categorize hospices according to
region) and average daily census (to classify hospices
according to size). Potential clinically significant drug
interactions (those that require monitoring, dose change,
or alternative therapy to realize a benefit or to minimize
risk from use17) were also identified for patients prescribed warfarin or LMWH.
Statistical Analysis
Patient and hospice variables were compared between
hospice patients who were prescribed anticoagulants and
those who were not, and subsequently between those who
were prescribed warfarin and those who were prescribed
LMWH. Variables were compared using the chi-square
test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon-MannWhitney test for continuous variables. A multivariate
logistic regression analysis was performed to determine
predictors of the dichotomous outcome of warfarin as
opposed to LMWH prescription. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were

RESULTS
Of 16,896 patients with lung cancer who received hospice
care in the home, 1557 (9.2%) were prescribed 1 anticoagulants. Table 1 shows the comparison of patients who
were prescribed anticoagulants versus those who were not.
The anticoagulant group was younger, was more likely
white, had a longer stay in hospice, took more concurrent
medications, had more comorbid illnesses, and was more
likely to be enrolled in a small- or medium-sized hospice.
All of these differences were statistically significant.
Among patients who were prescribed anticoagulants, 1206 (77.5%) were prescribed warfarin only, and
284 (18.2%) were prescribed LMWH only; 67 (4.3%)

patients were prescribed both warfarin and LMWH during their hospice stay and were not included in comparisons between the anticoagulant groups. Table 2 compares
characteristics according to anticoagulant group. Patients
prescribed warfarin were older, were more likely white,
had a longer stay in hospice, and had more comorbid illnesses. These differences were all statistically significant.
There were also significant between-group differences in
distribution according to US region and hospice size, with
a higher percentage of LMWH patients in the Northeast
and enrolled in small- or medium-sized hospices.

were significantly more likely to be prescribed LMWH. A
similar model was constructed that excluded patients who

the odds ratios for individual predictors remained nearly
the same (data not shown).

and none of the patients prescribed LMWH. Table 4 lists

warfarin. The strongest predictor of anticoagulant choice
was geographic region; hospices in the Northeast were
associated with significantly higher rates of LMWH prescription than in other regions. We also found many more
potential drug interactions with warfarin than with
LMWH.
The decision of whether to prescribe anticoagulants
for patients at the end of life is complex, given that the primary goal of hospice care is to reduce symptoms and promote quality of life. Two relatively small studies have
evaluated the benefits and risks of anticoagulation in
patients with thromboembolism who received palliative
care.8,18 A prospective randomized study of 20 patients
with cancer and an estimated life expectancy of 6
months who received nadroparin or placebo for thromboembolic prophylaxis showed a nonsignificant trend toward increased survival in the LMWH group without
increased risk of bleeding.8 In a case series of 62 patients
with advanced cancer and thromboembolic disease, 3 of 7
patients who stopped LMWH after 6 months developed
symptomatic recurrent thromboembolism; although
there was no major bleeding, the minor bleeding rate was
8.1%.18 No studies have specifically evaluated the effect
of anticoagulants on symptoms.19

Cancer

The potential benefits of anticoagulation, however,
must be balanced by the risks of bleeding, administration
concerns, and monitoring requirements that could negatively affect quality of life. This risk-benefit ratio is different when prescribing anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation
in hospice patients, as was the case for almost 15% of
patients taking warfarin in our sample. In that situation,
anticoagulation does not affect symptoms but reduces the
absolute risk of stroke by approximately 4% per year.20
For patients with a median survival of 20 days, if risk were
evenly distributed over time, this would be equivalent to a
0.22% absolute reduction in stroke risk while enrolled in
hospice.
One reason to continue anticoagulation at the end
of life is the possibility that discontinuing it in patients
with thromboembolism may hasten death. The annual
thromboembolic recurrence rate after discontinuing warfarin after at least 3 months of therapy is between 3.2%
and 10.9%.21 However, many of the trials that evaluated
the effects of discontinuing warfarin have excluded
patients with limited mobility or with limited life expectancy. A secondary consideration would be to extend life to
afford patients and families more time for resolution and
closure at the end of life. Another rationale is that anticoagulants could reduce swelling, pain, dyspnea, or other
symptoms associated with thromboembolic disease.
One reason to discontinue anticoagulation at the
end of life is the risk of bleeding, especially in patients
with renal insufficiency or low body weight. Although
dose reduction strategies to reduce bleeding risk have been
advocated for LMWH,18 there is no rationale for using
low-intensity warfarin, because it conveys a higher thromboembolic recurrence rate with a similar risk of bleeding.21 The risk of bleeding from anticoagulation may be
higher in hospice patients because of alterations in renal
function, malnutrition, and multiple drug-drug and
drug-disease interactions that require more intense monitoring. Drug interactions are a concern, because many
hospice patients have medications added to their regimens
at the end of life.22
Should clinicians choose to continue anticoagulation at the end of life, then the question becomes: Which
anticoagulant is the most appropriate? One advantage of
LMWH over warfarin is superior efficacy with respect to
recurrent thromboembolism in patients with cancer.7
However, the significance of this benefit is unclear in hospice patients with lung cancer, half of whom receive hospice care for <3 weeks. The normally touted advantage
that LMWHs do not require frequent blood monitoring

is not as certain in hospice care. LMWH increases bleeding risk in patients with renal disease and low body
weight,23 and hospice patients may have changing renal
function that is not routinely monitored.
The risk of bleeding with warfarin has not been
studied in hospice patients, but could be higher because of
poor oral intake. Malnutrition can lead to vitamin K
depletion in a few days. A small study of patients with
advanced cancer showed that 78% had evidence of vitamin K deficiency.24 In a prospective cohort study in 25
nursing homes, 490 patients taking warfarin over a 12month period had 720 adverse events and 253 potential
adverse events related to warfarin.24 Although most of
these adverse events were considered minor, 29% of the
total events were because of preventable errors in prescribing or monitoring.24 Although the patients in this study
were not hospice patients per se, nearly a quarter of hospice patients in the United States receive care in a nursing
home,12 and nursing home patients are at similar risk for
malnutrition and polypharmacy as hospice patients. A
possible strategy to reduce the risk of warfarin could be to
estimate bleeding risk and discontinue warfarin in those at
high risk.21 However, a risk-prediction tool has not been

4822

shown to strongly predict bleeding or patient outcomes.25
One outpatient bleeding risk index includes risks of age
65 years, history of stroke, history of gastrointestinal
bleeding, and 1 comorbid conditions, including recent
myocardial infarction, anemia, renal impairment, or diabetes mellitus. The rate of bleeding per 100 person-years
for low-risk (0 risk factors) patients was 0% and for moderate-risk (1-2 points) patients was 4.3%. There were too
few patients with a score of 3 to determine the rate of
bleeding for high-risk patients.26
Despite the advantages of LMWH over warfarin, a
main concern with LMWH use at the end of life is its
high cost.27 Medicare, the primary payer of hospice care
in the United States, reimburses hospice providers on a
fixed per diem basis of approximately $135 per day (with
slight variation depending on region), which covers all
costs, including medications.12 Prescribing a LMWH for
a hospice patient could expend 70% to 90% of the entire
daily Medicare reimbursement rate just from the average
cost per day of the LMWH alone. The implications of
switching from warfarin to LMWH are shown in Table 5,
which provides an estimate of the daily cost of anticoagulation for patients in our sample. The daily cost is based

on the average daily dose of the anticoagulant and average
wholesale price in 2006. It is worth noting that approximately $400 per year is required for monitoring
warfarin.28
Another possible advantage of warfarin over
LMWH is acceptability. Warfarin is administered orally
and has become easier to monitor at home with point-ofcare devices that use finger-stick specimens. A daily injection of an LMWH could impair quality of life.27 However, contrary to the concern that LMWH is invasive, a
qualitative study in the United Kingdom showed that cancer patients considered LMWH injections acceptable and
even preferable to antiembolic stockings with respect to
quality of life.10 Unfortunately, in this study, no comparison was made to patients prescribed warfarin.
Clinicians caring for patients at the end of life need
to make a difficult decision about whether to follow anticoagulation guidelines despite a lack of data about the
benefits and risks of using anticoagulants in hospice
patients. Our study describes anticoagulant use in hospice
patients before the introduction of new anticoagulation
guidelines by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in 2007,4 the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2007,6 and the American College of Chest
Physicians in 2008,5 all of which advocate lifelong anticoagulation for patients with active cancer and a history of
thromboembolism, preferably with LMWH rather than
warfarin. The extent to which the new guidelines will
affect hospice practice in the United States is unclear. Of
20 practitioners providing palliative care in 1 medical center in Austria, most agreed on anticoagulation for primary
or secondary prophylaxis of thromboembolism or for
atrial fibrillation in advanced cancer patients with good
performance status, but none would administer anticoagulants to patients who were approaching death.29
To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe
anticoagulant use in the hospice population. The limitations of our study result from its retrospective design.

mated, because we did not have data on medication
administration. Second, although we were able to report
the indication for anticoagulant use, we were unable to
further define the indication of thrombosis, a nonspecific
diagnosis that was more common in the warfarin group.
We also were unable to determine how long a patient had
a thromboembolic condition, which could be an important determinant for warfarin or LMWH use. In addition,
we were unable to establish a relationship between anticoagulation and quality of life because of a lack of data about
symptoms. There may be other reasons related to quality
of life, such as the ability to swallow or aversion to injections, for which a particular anticoagulant may have been
preferred. Third, although we were able to detect many
potentially clinically significant warfarin drug interactions, information on the actual occurrence of adverse
drug events was not available. Fourth, although we
included comorbidities based on a valid measure, data on
comorbidities may have been underreported, especially if
a patient was not prescribed drug therapy for a particular
condition. Finally, despite the finding that patients prescribed warfarin had a longer stay in hospice, an association between anticoagulation and survival in hospice
could not be determined from this study because of the
inability to control for cancer stage and severity of comorbid illness. Furthermore, the clinical significance of a difference in median length of stay of 4 days is not clear
without further information about quality of life.
Given recently updated guidelines advocating the
use of LMWH in patients with a history of thromboembolism and active cancer, optimal use of anticoagulants in
hospice patients needs to be determined. The change in
anticoagulation guidelines, favoring the long-term use of
LMWH in patients with cancer and thromboembolism, is
accompanied by changing attitudes of palliative care practitioners and their patients favoring anticoagulation with
LMWH.11 Hospice patients with cancer are at higher risk
of thromboembolism and bleeding; thus, the optimal balance between these risks must include the effect of anticoagulation and choice of anticoagulant on quality of life
and on burdensome symptoms at the end of life. In addition, the substantial cost incurred by instituting current
anticoagulation guidelines in end-of-life populations
whose medications are supported by a fixed daily reimbursement rate must be considered. Given the risk-benefit
ratio, the use of anticoagulants to prevent stroke for hospice patients with atrial fibrillation is probably not justified. Further study should be directed at determining the
benefits of anticoagulants in reducing symptoms at the
