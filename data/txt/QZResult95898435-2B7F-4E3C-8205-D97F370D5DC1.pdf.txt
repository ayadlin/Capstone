BACKGROUND: Neurotoxicity from adjuvant treatment with oxaliplatin has been studied in patients with colorectal carcinoma in
short-term studies, but, to the authors’ knowledge, the current article is the first long-term assessment which reports the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) investigation of whether excess neurotoxicity persists beyond 4 years. METHODS: As part of a colorectal cancer long-term survivor study (LTS-01), long-term neurotoxicity was assessed in 353 patients on
NSABP Protocol C-07 (cross-sectional sample). Ninety-two of these patients from LTS-01 also had longitudinal data and were reassessed 5 to 8 years (median, 7 years) after random assignment (longitudinal sample). Contingency tables compared cohorts, a mixed
model compared neurotoxicity between treatments over time, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test compared neurotoxicity between treatments (cross-sectional sample). RESULTS: In the cross-sectional sample, the increase in mean total neurotoxicity scores of 1.8 with
oxaliplatin was statistically significant (P ¼ .005), but not clinically significant (a minimally important difference of 4 was reported at
the long-term assessment). Patients who received oxaliplatin had increased odds of numbness and tingling in hands (odds ratio,
2.00; P ¼ .015) and feet (odds ratio, 2.78; P < .001) versus patients who did not receive oxaliplatin. The magnitude of the oxaliplatin
effect varied with time (P < .001) in the longitudinal sample, such that the oxaliplatin-treated group did not have significantly greater
total neurotoxicity scores by 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: At the long-term endpoint, there was no clinically significant increase in total
neurotoxicity scores for patients who received oxaliplatin, but the specific neurotoxicities of numbness and tingling of the hands and

INTRODUCTION
Although colorectal cancer (CRC) rates have decreased in the past 2 decades because of increased screening, CRC remains
the third leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women.1 Surgery is the mainstay treatment for stage II and III colon cancer, although it has been demonstrated that the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy improves disease-free and overall survival.2-12 Because of the high incidence of CRC and improvements in its treatment, 10% of the estimated 11.7
million individuals living with cancer in the United States in 2007, were survivors of CRC.13 Almost half (4.7 million) of
all cancer survivors were diagnosed at least 10 years earlier, requiring assessments of the long-term effects of cancer treatment. To address this need, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) designed a long-term survivorship study (LTS-01) in 2006 of CRC survivors from 5 completed NSABP trials (Protocols C-05, C-06, C-07, R-02,
and R-03) to assess quality of life and late toxicity from adjuvant treatment >4 years after random assignment to the parent trial.
One of the specific objectives of this long-term follow-up study was to compare neurotoxicity between treatment
groups from the C-07 trial. C-07 was a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial with the primary objective of comparing
the efficacy of fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FULV) versus the same regimen plus oxaliplatin (FLOX) in prolonging disease-free survival for patients with stage II or III colon cancer. Initial results with a 4-year median follow-up reported an
increase in disease-free survival in favor of FLOX (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P < .004).11 Updated results with an 8-year
median follow-up further support the benefit of oxaliplatin, with a reported increase in disease-free survival in favor of

FLOX (HR, 0.82; P ¼ .002), and overall survival had a
nonsignificant trend toward improved outcomes with
FLOX (HR, 0.88; P ¼ .08).14
Although oxaliplatin has been linked with improved
disease-free survival, it has also been associated with important acute and chronic toxicities and, thus, the need
for long-term neurotoxicity assessment. Oxaliplatin has
been identified as safe with the exception of dose-limiting
neurotoxicity characterized by peripheral sensory neuropathy, with dysesthesia and/or distal paresthesia often triggered or exacerbated by cold. Because of anticipated
peripheral sensory neuropathy, the NSABP monitored
self-reported neurotoxicity outcomes in a sample of C-07
patients at a long-term endpoint in the LTS-01 study. A
subset of these LTS-01 patients also had longitudinal neurotoxicity data. To our knowledge, the current report provides the first long-term comparison of the severity and
duration of neurotoxicity in patients who did and did not
receive oxaliplatin.
The trials that were included in the current analyses
are registered as National Clinical Trials (NCT)
00096278 (NSABP C-07) and NCT00410579 (NSABP

Selection of Participants

This report compares long-term neurotoxicity in 2 relevant groups of patients. The first group of patients is the
cross-sectional sample, which consists of 353 patients
from the C-07 trial who participated in the LTS-01 study.
Within this group, 92 patients had longitudinal neurotoxicity information, composing the second group of interest: the longitudinal sample (for the patient flow diagram,
see Fig. 1).
Cross-Sectional Sample

The cross-sectional sample consisted of 353 patients who
previously participated in the NSABP C-07 trial and were
reassessed in the LTS-01 study at a long-term endpoint
(range, 4.2-8.6 years [median, 6.0 years] after random
assignment). The LTS-01 study invited long-term survivors who previously participated in the NSABP C-05, C06, C-07, R-02, and R-03 CRC trials from 65 institutions
to enroll. Eligibility required that patients had survived at
least 3 years after study entry and had been in contact with
institutional staff within the prior 2 years. The institutional and patient recruitment process was reported previously (see Ganz et al.)18

This report is focused on patients in the LTS-01
who had participated in the C-07 trial. The C-07 trial
accrued patients with stage II or stage III colon cancer
from 2000 to 2002 who had undergone resection with curative intent. Patients were assigned randomly to receive
FULV (1245 patients) or FLOX (1247 patients). Patients
who had clinically significant (grade 2) peripheral sensory neuropathy according National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0,19 were excluded
from the C-07 study. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants for both the C-07 and LTS-01 studies. Protocols and consent forms were approved by the
National Institutes of Health and by the institutional
review boards of all participating institutions.
Of 65 institutions in the LTS-01 study, 60 institutions agreed to offer LTS-01 to their patients. Of 2408 eligible patients at participating institutions, 744 agreed to
participate, of which, 708 patients completed the interview. The remaining patients either were not contacted
successfully by institutional staff or did not agree to participate. The C-07 trial supplied 1038 of 2540 eligible LTS5615

01 patients (40.9%) and 372 of 744 LTS-01 patients
(50%) who agreed to participate. Similar proportions of
patients who were eligible to participate in the LTS-01
study by C-07 treatment arm actually participated. Interviews were completed by 354 of these patients, and 353
patients provided neurotoxicity information at the longterm endpoint (48% of patients who received FULV and
52% of patients who received FLOX).
Longitudinal Sample

The longitudinal sample consisted of 92 patients from the
C-07 study who participated in the LTS-01 trial and had
longitudinal neurotoxicity information from the PatientReported Outcomes (PRO) study. The PRO study was a
substudy of NSABP C-07 that enrolled the first 400
patients from participating Clinical Community Oncology
Programs. Of those 400 patients, 395 were eligible for neurotoxicity analysis over 18 months (for a description of this
subset, see Land et al.),17 and 92 participated in the LTS01 study. These 92 patients (46% of patients who received
FULV and 54% of patients who received FLOX) reported
neurotoxicity results at least at baseline and at the longterm endpoint, which, for this group, ranged from 5.5 to
8.1 years (median, 7.0 years) after random assignment.
Treatment

The FULV regimen included weekly 500 mg/m2 as an
intravenous bolus of fluorouracil for 6 weeks plus
500 mg/m2 of intravenous of leucovorin weekly for 6 weeks
of each 8-week cycle for 3 cycles. The FLOX regimen
added oxaliplatin to FULV at a dose of 85 mg/m2 administered intravenously in weeks 1, 3, and 5 of each 8-week
cycle for 3 cycles.11 Oxaliplatin dose modifications were
required by the protocol based on the National Cancer
Institute-Sanofi grade. Dose modification was required for
grade 2 toxicities that persisted between cycles or for
any grade 3 toxicity. Grade 4 toxicities or persistent grade 3
toxicities required termination of oxaliplatin.
Assessment of Neurotoxicity

To evaluate patient-reported neurotoxicity, patients
answered a 12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire (NTX-12)
from the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group Oxaliplatin-Specific
Neurotoxicity questionnaire.15,20,21 Patients completed the
questionnaire before random assignment (baseline); at week
4 of cycle 2; at 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month followup visits; and at the LTS-01 long-term assessment. Thus,
the assessment of neurotoxicity was the same for the crosssectional sample and for those who had longitudinal assessments. The NTX-12 questionnaire was comprised of statements intended to measure the severity and impact of
5616

peripheral sensory neuropathy on patients’ lives, including
numbness or tingling in hands or feet, discomfort in hands
or feet, joint pain, general weakness, trouble hearing, ringing or buzzing in ears, trouble with buttons, trouble feeling
shape of objects in hands, trouble walking, and pain in
hands or feet when exposed to cold temperatures. Patients
were instructed to choose the number corresponding to
how true each statement was for them in the past week using
a Likert-type scale, with 0 indicating not at all; 1, a little bit;
2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much. The NTX-12
score at each evaluation refers to the sum of the ratings from
the 12 items. This sum can range from 0 to 48, with lower
scores indicating less neuropathy. We previously proposed
that a difference of 4 points in the NTX-12 scale should be
considered a minimal clinically important difference (proposed in the C-07 protocol based on historic data).17
Statistical Methods

Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were used to compare
characteristics of the LTS-01 cross-sectional and longitudinal samples with characteristics of the C-07 population
to test the representativeness of the subsets to the C-07
population from which they originated. Differences in
patient characteristics between treatment groups for
patients in the LTS-01 longitudinal sample were computed using chi-square tests of independence. A Wilcoxon
rank-sum test compared neurotoxicity scores between
treatments for participants from the LTS-01 cross-sectional sample. The NTX-12 responses were dichotomized
according to severity (higher severity included the categories somewhat, quite a bit, or very much; whereas lesser severity included not at all or a little bit) and were analyzed
by logistic regression at the long-term endpoint. Comparisons of the distributions of severity level between treatment groups were computed using chi-square tests of
independence. A mixed-effects longitudinal analysis compared long-term total neurotoxicity scores for patients in
the longitudinal study between treatment groups from the
second cycle of treatment out to the long-term endpoint
controlling for baseline score and including continuously
measured time from baseline to each evaluation for each
patient, quadratic and cubic terms of time, and a term for
the interaction of time and treatment. Computations
were performed using the SAS statistical software package
(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

elsewhere.11,19,22 The long-term endpoint for the 353
patients in the cross-sectional sample ranged from 4.2 to 8.6
years from random assignment (median, 6.0 years), whereas
the long-term endpoint for the 92 patients in the longitudinal sample ranged from 5.5 to 8.1 years from random
assignment (median, 7.0 years). In both the cross-sectional
and longitudinal samples, the median time to long-term
endpoint did not vary between treatment groups: For the
cross-sectional sample, the median time to endpoint was
6.04 years for those who received FLOX and 6.07 years for
those who received FULV (P ¼ .60); whereas, for the longitudinal sample, the median time to endpoint was 6.92 years
for those who received FLOX and 6.84 years for those who
received FULV (P ¼ .42). The subsets of C-07 patients in
the cross-sectional and longitudinal LTS-01 samples were
representative of the C-07 population in terms of age, sex,
and site of colon cancer (Table 1). Both patient samples,
however, differed significantly from the C-07 population
with respect to the number of positive lymph nodes. In the
full C-07 population, 26% had 4 positive lymph nodes,
whereas this decreased to 20% and 13% of patients in the
cross-sectional and longitudinal samples, respectively.
Because more positive lymph nodes are associated with a
poorer prognosis, a decreased representation of these
patients is expected in studies of long-term survivors. There

were no significant imbalances between treatment groups
for patient characteristics among the 92 patients in the longitudinal sample (Table 2).
Neurotoxicity submission rates were acceptable in
the longitudinal sample. The lowest number of completed
questionnaires occurred during week 4 of cycle 2, in
which 76 of 92 patients, (83%) completed the questionnaire. There was no significant difference according to
treatment received in the number of questionnaires completed over the 6 evaluation time points (P ¼ .996), and
the reasons given for missing forms were similar across
treatments. In the FULV and FLOX groups, 72% and
67%, respectively, of missed assessments were because of
staff oversight or for reasons unrelated to the patients’
condition or choice. The median dose of oxaliplatin
received for patients on the FLOX arm was 677 mg/m2
(interquartile range, 320-763 mg/m2).11

For the 92 patients who had baseline and long-term data
available, there were a total of 498 neurotoxicity evaluations over 6 time points. For all patients at all evaluations,
the total neurotoxicity score ranged from 0 to 33 (mean
score, 4.66; median score, 3). Ninety percent of NTX-12
scores were <12, and only 6 observations reported very
high neurotoxicity (scores >23).
Initially, the mean change from baseline in the
NTX-12 score for patients who received FLOX was much
greater than the mean change for patients who received
FULV, but this difference dissipated by the long-term
assessment. The median changes from baseline in the
NTX-12 score followed a similar pattern but were lower
than the mean changes from baseline for both treatment
groups at each evaluation. The only difference in median
scores deemed clinically important occurred at week 4 of
cycle 2 with a difference of 5 (Fig. 4).
For the first 4 assessments after baseline, the 95%
CIs of the mean changes from baseline for patients who
received FULV straddled zero, indicating little or no
change from baseline; whereas, for patients who received
FLOX, the CIs were greater than zero. The mean changes
from baseline and their CIs, however, were almost identical at the long-term assessment for both treatment groups.
Also, the 95% CIs around the mean overlapped from the
12-month assessment to the long-term endpoint, illustrating no significant difference in the mean (median) change

from baseline in the neurotoxicity scores between treatment groups (Fig. 4).
A mixed-effects model verified that the effect of oxaliplatin on the NTX-12 score changed significantly with
time (P < .001). For patients with a zero baseline NTX12 score in the FULV group, the mean NTX-12 score
prediction was 0.77 at 6 months from baseline, 2.45 at 5
years from baseline, and 3.65 at 7 years. For similar
patients with a zero baseline NTX-12 score in the FLOX
group, the mean NTX-12 score prediction was 3.35 at 6
months from baseline, 3.63 at 5 years, and 3.92 at 7 years.
Thus, the model suggests that, for patients with identical
baseline neurotoxicity scores, the initial substantial difference in neurotoxicity scores during treatment dissipated
by 7 years from baseline.
DISCUSSION
Neurotoxicity caused by oxaliplatin was reported previously by the C-07 and MOSAIC (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin
in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer) trials.
Land et al reported significant differences in neurotoxicity scores between treatments up to 18 months after
treatment onset in the C-07 trial.17 The MOSAIC trial
extended the time period analyzed by Land et al, reporting neurotoxic effects up to 48 months, but only for the
treatment arm that included oxaliplatin, making a longterm treatment comparison impossible.12 Park et al also
reported oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy results for 24
oxaliplatin-treated patients with follow-up at a median
of 25 months post-treatment.23 At follow-up, 79.2% of
those patients reported residual neuropathic symptoms,
and the severity of their neurotoxicity scores correlated
with cumulative dose. However, with a median followup of just over 2 years, Park et al only reported neurotoxicity information for a small sample of patients who
received oxaliplatin, again making a treatment comparison impossible.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
long-term comparison of the severity and duration of
neurotoxicity in patients treated with and without
oxaliplatin, which indicates that, at the long-term
assessment (median, 6 years), differences by treatment
in mean and median neurotoxicity scores in the
cross-sectional sample (n ¼ 353) was half that
deemed clinically important. Although there were differences in neurotoxicity scores between treatment
groups in the first 18 months of the C-07 colon
cancer trial, the longitudinal sample (n ¼ 92) established that these differences dissipated by the long5620

term evaluation. At the long-term endpoint, the
increase in the mean total neurotoxicity score for
patients who received FULV most likely was because
of the general increase in peripheral sensory neuropathy in an aging population.24
Findings from shorter term studies, like those by
Haller et al25 and André et al,12 corroborate our findings
that some neurotoxic effects from oxaliplatin are reversible. Haller et al25 reported grade 3 or 4 neurosensory toxicity in 11% of patients who received oxaliplatin (vs 8%
of patients who were treated without oxaliplatin), and persistent symptoms in 5% of patients resolved a median of 1
month after completion of treatment. André et al12
reported that 92% of patients from the MOSAIC trial
who received oxaliplatin experienced peripheral sensory
neuropathy of any grade during treatment; however, 4
years after completion of therapy, only 15.5% reported
peripheral sensory neuropathy, and only <1% had symptoms graded as severe.
In the 2007 report by Land et al, foot discomfort,
foot numbness or tingling, and hand or foot pain in the
cold were significantly more severe in the patients who
received oxaliplatin at 18 months.17 From our long-term
analysis, sensitivity to the cold as well as foot discomfort
no longer differed significantly between the treatment
groups, demonstrating that treatment-related differences
in these effects disappear or at least decrease 6 years after
random assignment. Hand and foot numbness or tingling
appeared to be the longest lasting side effects for those
who received oxaliplatin. The odds of hand numbness or
tingling were significantly greater for the FLOX group
during therapy and, although no longer significant at 18
months, were significantly greater at the long-term endpoint. The odds of foot numbness or tingling remained
significantly greater for those in the FLOX group during
therapy, both at 18 months and at the long-term
assessment.
It is important to develop specific countermeasures
to address these neurotoxic effects, which occur during
and continue after treatment. Additional studies using a
pharmacogenetic approach to assess toxicity and survival
in patients with CRC who receive oxaliplatin may shed
light on which patients are more susceptible to peripheral
sensory neuropathy, provide early detection and supplemental treatment strategies for those who develop peripheral sensory neuropathy, and create specific medications
to address the lingering effects of hand and foot numbness
or tingling.26-29
We note that, because neurotoxicity scores correlate
with cumulative oxaliplatin dose, the expected cumulative

Long-Term Neurotoxicity of Oxaliplatin/Kidwell et al

oxaliplatin exposure in the C-07 trial (765 mg/m2) was
less than that from the trials reported by Haller et al (1040
mg/m2) and André et al (1020 mg/m2), as expected, based
on the regimen. Thus, our findings may underestimate
the long-term results in other long-term survivors who
received regimens with different schedules of oxaliplatin.
Along with the lower cumulative dose of oxaliplatin from
the C-07 study, other limitations include the relatively
small sample size of the longitudinal sample; the use of a
relatively new patient-reported outcome measure to assess
neurotoxicity; and a lack of comparison between the treatment groups of the longitudinal, cross-sectional, and original cohorts with respect to comorbidities that increase
neuropathy.
The longitudinal sample provided adequate evidence, especially when combined with the comparison
of mean scores from cross-sectional samples and other
studies, that there was not a clinically significant difference in long-term NTX-12 scores for patients who
did and did not receive oxaliplatin. Numbness or tingling of hands and feet persisted at an elevated incidence for oxaliplatin-treated patients 6 years from
random assignment. This study enhances physicians’
and patients’ understanding of the severity and duration of neurotoxic effects of oxaliplatin. Efforts should
be made to minimize peripheral sensory neuropathy
during and after oxaliplatin treatment so that patients
can benefit from extended disease-free survival while
maintaining their quality of life.
