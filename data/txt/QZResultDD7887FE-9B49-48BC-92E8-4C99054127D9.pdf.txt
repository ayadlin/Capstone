Summary

Author Manuscript

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide,
with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 10–15% 1. Deregulation of the Ras pathway is a
frequent hallmark of NSCLC, often through mutations that directly activate Kras 2. p53 is also
frequently inactivated in NSCLC and, since oncogenic Ras can be a potent trigger of p53 3, it
seems likely that oncogenic Ras signalling plays a major and persistent part in driving the
selection against p53. Hence, pharmacological restoration of p53 is an appealing therapeutic
strategy for treating this disease 4. Here, we model the likely therapeutic impact of p53 restoration
in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of NSCLC initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of
endogenous Kras 5. Surprisingly, p53 restoration failed to induce significant regression of
established tumours although it did result in a significant decrease in the relative proportion of
tumours classed as high grade. This is due to selective activation of p53 only in the more
aggressive tumour cells within each tumour. Such selective activation of p53 correlates with
marked up regulation in Ras signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic signalling sensor
p19ARF 6. Our data indicate that p53-mediated tumour suppression is triggered only when
oncogenic Ras signal flux exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of low-level
oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the capacity of p53 to restrain early
tumour evolution and to the efficacy of therapeutic p53 restoration to eradicate cancers.

Inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway is a common feature of human cancers,
fostering the attractive notion of restoring p53 function in established tumours as an
effective and tumour-specific therapeutic strategy 4. Indeed, p53 restoration was recently
shown to trigger dramatic tumour regression in vivo 7–9. While encouraging, these studies
utilized tumour models (either transgene 7,9 or radiation-induced 8) driven by
preternaturally high levels of oncogenes. Because high-level oncogene activity potently
engages p53 via the p19ARF tumour suppressor 6,7,10, p53 restoration has a dramatic impact
in these models. Unlike high oncogenic activity, however, low-level expression of dominant
oncogenes appears insufficient to engage intrinsic tumour suppression, even though it still
suffices to drive tumourigenesis 11,12. This raises the spectre that many epithelial
malignancies, initiated as they are by low-level oncogenic signals such as those arising from
mutational activation of ras genes in situ, may be insensitive to p53 restoration - at least
during certain phases of their evolution. To investigate this possibility we assessed the
ability of p53 restoration to trigger tumour regression in the well-characterized Lox-StopLox-KrasG12D (KR) murine tumour model of NSCLC 5 wherein tumourigenesis is driven by
sporadic, low-level activation of mutant Kras. This model closely recapitulates its human
disease counterpart 13.

After inhalation of adenovirus-Cre, KR mice develop multiple, independently evolving lung
tumours, permitting contemporaneous analysis of different disease stages within each
animal. KR mice were crossed into the p53KI/KI switchable mouse model in which both
alleles of the endogenous p53 gene are replaced by the conditional variant p53ERTAM 14.
p53KI/KI mice can be reversibly toggled in vivo between p53 wild-type (wt) and p53 null
states by administration or withdrawal of Tamoxifen (Tam). Importantly, once functionally
restored in Tam-treated p53KI/KI mice, p53-mediated tumour suppression is triggered only if
p53-activating signals are present 7,10.
KrasG12D was sporadically activated in KR;p53KI/+ and KR;p53KI/KI lungs and tumours
allowed to develop for 16 weeks. In both genotypes, KrasG12D activation induced a
spectrum of lung tumour grades including hyperplasias, adenomas and adenocarcinomas.
Like KR;p53-deficient animals 15 (Supplementary Figure 1), KR;p53KI/KI mice exhibit
accelerated tumour progression and increased incidence of high-grade tumours relative to
their KR;p53KI/+ counterparts. These data affirm that p53 restrains Kras-driven NSCLC yet
indicate that, even when combined, KrasG12D activation and p53 inactivation are insufficient
to generate malignant tumours without additional, aleatory mutations.

To ascertain its therapeutic impact, p53 function was restored for one week in KR;p53KI/KI
lung tumours (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, given the dramatic tumour regression induced by
p53 restoration in other models 7–9, p53 restoration had no macroscopically evident impact
on these tumours (Figure 1B). Close inspection, however, indicated that p53 restoration did
elicit a modest decrease in proliferating tumour cells (Figure 1C; 13.99% Ki67 positive cells
per Tam-treated tumours versus 20.97% in controls) and an increase in apoptosis
(Supplemental Figure 2 and Figure 1D; 45% of p53-restored tumours contain apoptotic cells
versus 13.5% of control tumours). Nevertheless, the distribution of apoptotic cells in
tumours following p53 restoration was irregular and clustered (Figure 1E). This high
variability in the response to sustained p53 restoration was confirmed by microCT imaging

of individual tumours over 7 days. While all control tumours grew during treatment,
individual Tam-treated tumours exhibited all possible responses – some grew, others were
unchanged, and many shrank (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 3). Such variability in
tumour response to Tam might reflect heterogeneities among tumor cells in the efficiency of
p53 restoration, in the presence of p53-activating signals, or in the engagement of
downstream effectors following p53 restoration. To determine which, we first ascertained
the efficiency with which Tam restored p53 function in tumours. Mice were treated for 7
days with Tam or vehicle and then exposed to a single dose of γ-radiation (IR) 2 hrs after the
last treatment to activate p53 directly. p53 activity was then monitored in individual tumours
by assaying induction of the prototypical p53-responsive gene, CDKN1A (p21cip1) 16,17.
All tumours showed substantial CDKN1A induction (Figure 2B), indicating that systemic
Tam pervasively restores p53 function in all tumours. Hence, the heterogeneity of the
therapeutic response to Tam is not a consequence of either variability in Tam-dependent p53
restoration or in the capacity of p53, once activated, to induce CDKN1A. By contrast, when
p53 function was restored in the absence of concomitant DNA damage, CDKN1A was
induced in only a minority of tumours (Figure 2B). Hence, the variability in response to p53
restoration is because only a minority of tumours harbour endogenous p53-activating
signals. Interestingly, whereas we see abundant apoptosis in aggressive tumour cells
following p53 restoration, Feldser et al. in an accompanying paper do not 18, even though
their mouse lung tumour model driven by spontaneous, sporadic KRas activation is
ostensibly similar to ours. The reasons for this are unclear. However, the models differ in
several ways. First, the mechanism of KRas activation is different, and may target distinct
cell lineages with innately different sensitivities to p53-induced apoptosis. Second, they use
Cre-lox recombination to restore p53 function, which is innately less synchronous than in
our p53ERTAM model and may make it difficult to see a transient wave of cell death. Crelox recombination may also introduce additional genotoxic stresses that further modify p53
output. In the end, however, whether apoptosis or senescence is the principal output of p53
restoration in aggressive tumour cells may not be so important since that both p53-induced
apoptosis 7 and senescence 9 are effective at eliciting tumour clearance.

Author Manuscript

Although p53 may be activated by a wide-range of stress signals, recent in vivo studies
implicate induction of p19ARF by oncogenic signalling as the critical p53-activating trigger
in established tumours 7,10. Since oncogenic Ras can be a potent inducer of p19ARF 19, we
assayed for p19ARF expression in KR;p53KI/KI lung tumours. Immunohistochemical analysis
(IHC) of KR;p53KI/KI lungs revealed p19ARF expression to be highly heterogeneous –
generally limited to specific regions of certain tumours. Stratification of lung tumours into
low and high-grade, the latter comprising mostly adenocarcinomas (Supplemental Figure 4)
20, revealed that p19ARF was confined mostly to high-grade tumours. High p19ARF cells
were only rarely observed in low-grade tumours and, when present, were restricted to small,
sporadic foci. Close examination of transitional tumours comprising clearly defined high
and low-grade regions showed p19ARF to be highly expressed only in high-grade/carcinoma
areas (Figure 2C).
Since p19ARF is a potent activator of p53, we next ascertained whether the high-grade
regions expressing elevated p19ARF coincide with those that spontaneously activate p53

following restoration. p53 function was acutely restored in KR;p53KI/KI mice and tumours
analyzed for expression of p19ARF and p21cip1. Upon p53 restoration, tumour areas positive
for p19ARF overlapped extensively with those positive for p21cip1 (Figure 2D): ~70% of
p19ARF–positive cells from Tam-treated mice stained positive for p21cip1 compared with 2%
of control. That p19ARF plays a causal role in engaging p53-mediated tumour suppression in
high-grade tumours was corroborated by the rapid cessation of cell proliferation specific to
p19ARF-positive regions following p53 restoration (Figure 3A – Tam, two upper rows). By
contrast, proliferation remained high in p19ARF-negative tumours after p53-restoration
(Figure 3A –Tam, two lower rows). Of note, no γ-H2AX staining DNA damage foci were
detected in KR;p53KI/KI lung tumours, although they were readily evident in tumours from
γ-irradiated mice (Supplemental Figure 5). The remarkable overlap between p53 activation
and p19ARF expression strongly implicates p19ARF, and not DNA damage, as the
endogenous signal responsible for triggering p53 in high-grade lung tumours.

Although germ-line p53 deficiency significantly accelerates lung tumour progression and
malignancy in KR mice 15, our data indicate that p53 tumour suppression acts only at later
stages of tumour evolution. Since p53 is specifically activated in the most aggressive tumour
cells, its restoration in a mixed tumour population should lead to a shift downwards in
assigned tumour grade. Indeed, 7 days of p53 restoration in KR;p53KI/KI mice harbouring a
mixture of low and high-grade tumours elicited a downward shift in the frequency of highgrade tumours (from 29% to 11%) and a pro rata increase in the proportion of low-grade
tumours (from 71% to 89%) (Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure 6). The percentage of
BrdU-positive high-grade cells was also dramatically reduced following treatment (Figure
3C).

Our data show that the p19ARF/p53 pathway is only engaged in high-grade KR;p53KI/KI
cells, even though all tumour cells harbour oncogenic KrasG12D. Hence, oncogenic activity
of Kras is not alone sufficient to induce p19ARF and engage p53-mediated tumour
suppression. Interestingly, recent in vivo studies indicate that intrinsic tumour suppression is
only engaged when oncogenic signals are preternaturally elevated 11,12. Such observations
echo in vitro data showing that expression of oncogenic KrasG12D from its endogenous
promoter induces proliferation and immortalization whereas KrasG12D over-expression
engages p53-dependent replicative senescence 21,22. Since marked up-regulation of the
MAPK-pathway is a characteristic feature of advanced lung tumours in both mice 15 and
NSCLC in humans 23, we asked whether induction of p19ARF in high-grade tumours is a
consequence of elevated flux through the Ras signalling network. Indeed, immunostaining
showed a remarkably tight spatial concordance of tumour cells exhibiting elevated ERK
phosphorylation (p-ERK), a signature of downstream Ras signalling, and those with high
p19ARF (Figures 4A and Supplemental Figure 7) – the cell-by-cell overlap between upregulation of p19ARF and p-ERK was 91.2% (n=1312; STDEV: 3.77). Hence, increased flux
through oncogenic KrasG12D is the likely mechanism for both malignant progression and
concomitant activation of (and eventual counter-selection against) the p19ARF/p53 tumour
suppressor pathway.
Many potential mechanisms might underlie the dramatic up-regulation of p-ERK we observe
in high-grade lung tumours, including changes in Kras copy number (known to occur in

human NSCLC), secondary inactivation of the wt Kras allele, inactivation of Kras negative
feedback mechanisms and incidental activation of cooperating oncogenes 24–27. Initial
analysis of whole low versus high-grade tumours suggested downregulation of Sprouty 2 or
loss of the wt Kras allele as possible mechanisms for Kras signal up-regulation in high pERK tumours (Supplemental Figure 8). Since elevated Ras signalling is a property peculiar
to high-grade tumour regions, we used p-ERK staining to demarcate high, low and mixed pERK areas of individual tumours (Figure 4B, upper panel). These tumour regions were
individually laser microdissected and their genomic DNA extracted and assessed for the
relative copy representation of wt versus mutant Kras alleles. We saw variable levels of wt
Kras retention in the low/mixed p-ERK tumour tissues, ranging from 100% in the low pERK tumour 14 through to partial or total loss in the mixed grade tumours (e.g. 21 and 18).
Remarkably, the wt Kras allele was lost in all high p-ERK tumours (Figure 4B, lower panel)
and the mutant Kras allele often duplicated (Supplemental Figure 9). Overall, across all
tumour samples Kras allelic imbalance, a known mechanism by which Ras signal strength is
elevated 27, correlated tightly with high p-ERK.

Long-lived organisms must solve the problem of suppressing cancer without compromising
the facility of normal cells to proliferate. This requires an accurate means of distinguishing
between normal and oncogenic signals. However, emerging evidence hints at a “flaw” in
how our tumour suppressor pathways have evolved – rather than responding to the aberrant
signal persistence that is actually responsible for oncogenesis, mammalian intrinsic tumour
suppressor pathways have instead evolved to respond to the unusual elevation in signal
intensity that often (but not invariably) accompanies oncogenic activation 11. Paradoxically,
therefore, low-level oncogenic activities may be more efficient at initiating tumourigenesis
than high-level oncogenic signals because they “fall beneath the radar” of tumour
surveillance 28: high-level oncogenic signals, which appear necessary to drive progression
to malignancy, are tolerable only once p53 function has been quelled.

Author Manuscript

At first glance, our data showing limited therapeutic impact of restoring p53 in established
lung tumours appear at odds with previous studies 7–9. However, such studies utilized
advanced, relatively homogenous tumours driven by high levels of oncogenic signalling that
had already engaged the ARF pathway – hence the dramatic impact of re-instating p53. By
contrast, the spontaneously evolving lung tumours that afflict KR mice are initiated by
sporadic oncogenic activation of endogenous Kras at a level insufficient to engage p53. Our
data suggest that it is only relatively late in their evolution, at the point when sporadic
elevation of Ras signalling precipitates tumours into aggressive, high-grade lesions, that the
p53 pathway is triggered. Such considerations offer a compelling rationale for the longbaffling observation that selection for p53 pathway inactivation arises relatively late in the
evolution of many solid human tumours.
The inability of low-level oncogenic signalling to engage p53 also casts a cautionary shadow
over the potential efficacy of p53 restoration in treating cancer. Established tumours are
typically comprised of heterogeneous clades of neoplastic clones that encompass all phases
of oncogenic evolution. Although p53 restoration might cull the most malignant cells, less
aggressive tumour cells driven by low-level oncogenic signals would presumably survive to

evolve another day. At best, then, p53 restoration as a single therapy would be a means of
temporary tumour containment rather than eradication.

METHODS SUMMARY
Tumour induction and treatment
Animals were maintained under UCSF IACUC-approved protocols. KR 5 and p53KI mice 14
progeny were infected with Adenovirus-CRE (5 × 107 pfu/mouse) by nasal inhalation at 8
weeks of age 5. p53 function was restored by intraperitoneal injection of Tamoxifen (1 mg/
mouse/daily) 7,10,14. Where appropriate, mice were irradiated (4 Gy) 2 hr after Ctrl/Tam
treatment using a Mark 1–68 137Cesium source (0.637 Gy/min). A minimum of 5 mice per
cohort was used for each experiment.

Immunohistochemistry and immunoflourescence
Primary antibodies used were p19ARF (gift from CJ. Sherr and MF Roussel 29); p21 (BD
Pharmigen #556430); Ki67 (SP6 Neomarkers); P-ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies #4376)
and phospho-histone H2AX (Upstate #05-636). They were detected with HRP-/Alexaconjugated secondary antibodies. An Apoptag™ kit (Chemicon) was used for TUNEL.
LCM, expression and copy number analysis

Author Manuscript

For CDKN1A Taqman analysis 8, LCM isolation of frozen samples 30 was followed by
RNA preparation (Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit, Arcturus Engineering) and cDNA
production (iScript cDNA Synthesis kit, Bio-Rad). For copy number analysis, LCM (Zeiss
P.A.L.M) collection of paraffin samples was followed by DNA isolation (QIAamp® DNA
Micro Kit #56304) and Taqman (probes: β-Actin: Mm00607939_s1; Kras:
Mm03053281_s1, Applied Biosystems) or PCR (primers: KrasHind3_F
GCCATTAGCTGCTACAAAACAGTA and KrasHind3_R
CCTCTATCGTAGGGTCGTACTCAT). Following PCR the KrasG12D and Kraswt alleles
were distinguished by the presence of a KrasG12D-specific HindIII site in the amplified
fragment (WT = 400 bp; KrasG12D = 300 +100 bp).
MicroCT X-Ray Tomography
Pre- (day 0) and post-therapy (day 7) MicroCT data was acquired using a FLEX™ X-O™
system (Gamma Medica-Ideas, Northridge, CA). Only clearly discrete tumours were
measured.
Immunoblot Analysis

Author Manuscript

Whole-cell lysates from dissected tumour halves were immunoblotted with anti-Spry 2
(Abcam ab50317), Dusp6 (Santa Cruz sc-28902) or β-actin (Sigma A5441) antibodies.

METHODS
Mice, adenoviral infection and treatments

inhalation with Adenovirus-CRE (5 × 107 pfu/mouse) at 8 weeks of age, as described 5. p53
function was restored by treating mice with Tamoxifen (1 mg/mouse/daily) delivered by
intraperitonial injection, as described 7,10,14. Where appropriate, mice were irradiated (4
Gy) 2 hr after Ctrl/Tam treatment using a Mark 1–68 137Cesium source (0.637 Gy/min). A
minimum of 5 mice per cohort were used for each experiment.
Immnunohistochemistry and immunoflourescence

Author Manuscript

IHC stainings were performed on z-fix fixed, 5 µm paraffin embedded tissue sections.
Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: p19ARF
(gift from CJ. Sherr and MF Roussel 29); p21 (BD Pharmigen #556430, San Jose, CA) ;
Ki67 (SP6, Neomarkers: Fremont, CA); P-ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies #4376,
Danvers, MA), phospho-Histone H2AX (Upstate #05-636, Billerica, MA). Antibodies were
detected using Vectastain ABC™ detection (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or with
specific biotinylated secondaries (anti-Rat biotinylated, Vector Laboratories BA-4001 and
anti-Rabbit biotinylated, Dako #E0432) followed with stable diamobenzidine treatment
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Alternatively, Alexa-conjugated mouse, rat or rabbit IgG
antibodies were used (Molecular Probes). TUNEL staining was performed using the
Apoptag™ flourescein labeled kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacturers directions.
Laser capture microdissection, expression and copy number analysis

Author Manuscript

For RNA analysis 30 µm sections from fresh frozen lung tissue were fixed, stained and laser
capture microdissected, as previously described 30. Total RNA was isolated and DNase I
treated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain
View, CA). cDNA was produced utilising iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Real time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed as previously described 8. For
copy number analysis 5 µm sections were briefly de-paraffinised and laser capture
microdissected using a Zeiss P.A.L.M. LCM microscope. Genomic DNA was isolated using
the QIAamp® DNA Micro Kit #56304 and analysed by Taqman or PCR. Copy number
Taqman analysis was carried out using the following probes from Applied Biosystems: βActin: Mm00607939_s1; Kras: Mm03053281_s1. PCR was performed using the following
Kras-specific primers: KrasHind3_F GCCATTAGCTGCTACAAAACAGTA and
KrasHind3_R CCTCTATCGTAGGGTCGTACTCAT. Due to the presence of a unique
HindIII restriction site in the KrasG12D allele, the mutant and wt alleles can be distinguished
based on their HindIII restriction-digestion profile (WT = 400 bp and KrasG12D = 300 +100
bp).
Micro-computed X-ray tomography

Author Manuscript

Computed tomography (CT) was performed using a micro CT system (FLEX™ X-O™,
Gamma Medica-Ideas, Northridge, CA) with an x-ray source with 75 kVp and 0.315 mA.
CT data were acquired as 512 projections over 120 seconds of continuous x-ray exposure.
Pre-therapy CT data were acquired as the baseline time point and post-therapy CT
performed after 7 days of sustained Tamoxifen administration. Only clearly discrete tumours
were picked for volume measurements. Volumes of interest were drawn on axial slices, and
the total tumour volumes were calculated planimetrically.

Figure 3. p53 restoration targets high-grade, but not low-grade, lung tumour cells

a. Co-immunostaining for p19ARF and the proliferation marker Ki67 in lung tumours from
KR;p53KI/KI mice treated for 24 hrs with vehicle (Ctrl, upper row) or Tam (four lower rows).
Row 2 and 3 illustrate the profound anti-proliferative impact (low Ki67) of p53 restoration
in tumours with high p19ARF levels. By contrast, the lower two rows show lack of growth
inhibition following p53 restoration in tumours lacking detectable p19ARF. Scale bar = 50
