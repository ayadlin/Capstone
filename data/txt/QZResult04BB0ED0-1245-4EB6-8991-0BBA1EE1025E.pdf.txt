Abstract
Elevated expression of the NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L scaffolding protein promotes tumor cell invasion and
metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. Conversely, generation of mammary tumors in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-polyoma virus middle T (PyVT) genetic model is delayed by a Nedd9−/− genotype. These activities arise from the role of NEDD9 in assembling complexes and supporting activity of
cancer signaling proteins, including FAK, Src, Shc, and AKT, and would support evaluation of NEDD9
expression as an unambiguous biomarker for tumor aggressiveness. However, we here show that despite
the initial delay in tumor growth, cells derived from MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− tumors are characteristically
hyperaggressive versus MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells in anchorage-independent growth, in growth on threedimensional matrix produced by tumor-associated fibroblasts, and in formation of tumors after mammary
orthotopic reinjection and of lung metastases after tail vein injection. This reversal suggests the specific
selection of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells for growth in an in vivo microenvironment. Indeed, MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− cells have increased cell cycle, centrosomal, and mitotic defects, phenotypes compatible with the
increased selection of these cells for aggressive growth. Intriguingly, in spite of their aggressive phenotype,
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells persistently have low levels of Src activation and are hypersensitive to the Src
kinase inhibitor dasatinib. These studies identify NEDD9 as a complex modulator of different aspects of
mammary tumor growth. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8907–16. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L noncatalytic scaffolding protein
coordinates signaling cascades that control migration and
invasion (1–3), cell cycle transition through M-phase (4–6),
and apoptosis (7). Upregulation of NEDD9 is associated with
enhanced invasion and metastasis in human and murine tumors and cell lines including melanoma, lung, breast, and
brain (reviewed in ref. 8). Reciprocally, we recently reported
that a Nedd9−/− genotype increased the latency of tumors
formed in the aggressive mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV)-polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyVT) mouse
mammary tumor model (9). NEDD9 is a central component
of integrin-dependent signaling cascades that activate the
FAK and Src kinases to promote cell migration and is also
involved in lateral communication through Shc and other

proteins to the Ras signaling cascades (8, 9). In MMTVPyVT;Nedd9−/− tumors, activation of FAK, Src, AKT, and
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) was typically
significantly reduced, as was the migratory and invasive
behavior of isolated cell lines (9). Taken in sum, these data
support the straightforward interpretation that NEDD9 is a
tumor-promoting factor and that high levels of NEDD9 in
tumors correlate with poor prognosis and treatment resistance. As such, this would support adaptation of NEDD9
expression as a biomarker for aggressive disease, as has
been proposed (10).
However, some observations argue that NEDD9 may have
a more complex role in tumor formation, invasion, and metastasis. For example, whereas the majority of studies have
shown a positive effect of NEDD9 on regulation of cell migration, two works have reported that NEDD9 can negatively
regulate the migration of MCF10A normal breast epithelial
cells, and mRNA profiling experiments suggest that Nedd9
expression negatively correlates with the metastasis of
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to bone (11, 12). This
may reflect cell type–specific differences in NEDD9 function
or, alternatively, indicate that cellular response to altered expression of NEDD9 is dynamic at different stages of tumor
growth. In potential support of the latter interpretation, we
have previously shown that NEDD9 directly binds and regulates the activity of the Aurora-A (AurA) kinase (5, 6, 13). Because of its role in timing mitotic progression, AurA levels
and activity are highly regulated within a narrow range, with

both overexpression and depletion causing centrosomal and
mitotic defects and contributing to genomic instability (14).
In cell culture experiments, we have determined that exogenous overexpression or siRNA depletion of NEDD9 results in
similar cell cycle phenotypes, based on aberrant regulation
of AurA (5).
These data led us to hypothesize that although the absence of NEDD9 might initially delay tumor appearance, it
may also increase in vivo selection pressures affecting tumor
growth, thus reconciling contradictory observations. In this
study, we have analyzed early-passage cells derived from
the mammary tumors of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− and MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ mice to test this idea. The results of this study
strongly support the idea that constitutive absence of Nedd9
in tumors induces defects in cell cycle associated with reduced function of AurA and a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Intriguingly, our data also indicate that the absence of
NEDD9 causes a persistent deficiency in Src activation and
influences the susceptibility of mammary cancer cell lines
to growth inhibition by dasatinib, a drug targeting Src kinase.
These studies in sum should significantly inform the use of
NEDD9 as a biomarker for clinical response.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell growth measurements
The protocol for derivation of mammary tumor cell lines
from MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− and MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ mice
was described in ref. 9. Basal proliferation rates for all cell lines
were measured by seeding 1 × 105 cells into 0.1% gelatin–coated
T25 flasks and then propagating them for up to 96 hours, after
which cells were trypsinized and counted using trypan blue
exclusion analysis at the times indicated. To contrast cell
proliferation on tissue culture plastic or on matrix produced
by NIH3T3 cells or tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) to
simulate an in vivo microenvironment, matrix was prepared
and measurements were made using protocols described in
detail in refs. 15, 16. Typically, cell lines were plated at a density
of 50,000 cells per well in 12-well plates directly onto tissue
culture plastic, NIH3T3-derived three-dimensional (3D)
matrix, or TAF-derived 3D matrix. Cells were grown for 24,
48, 72, and 96 hours and then treated with 10% (v/v) Alamar
Blue solution (Invitrogen); fluorescence was measured with a
plate reader. For drug treatment experiments, cells were seeded into 48- or 96-well plates. After 24 hours, vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) or drugs [dasatinib and erlotinib (obtained from the
Fox Chase Cancer Center pharmacy) and C1368 (Sigma)] were
added to the medium. After 72 hours, cell viability was assessed
by Alamar Blue assay. All assays were performed a minimum of
three times in triplicate. Cell cycle compartmentalization was
measured using a Guava Personal Cell Analysis-96 System
(Guava Technologies). Soft-agar experiments were performed
using standard techniques, as described in ref. 17. For rescue
experiments, cells were transfected with the plasmids pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech) containing Nedd9 and pCDNA3.1-mRFP
(Invitrogen) containing AurA to overexpress GFP-Nedd9 and
RFP-AurA, respectively.

Orthotopic and tail vein injections
Care of mice and injection protocols were approved by the
Fox Chase Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and followed the NIH guidelines. For orthotopic
injection, 1 × 106 cells in 200 μL of PBS were injected (bilateral inguinal) into the fourth mammary fat pad of severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (five mice per cell
line). Mice were palpated twice weekly for tumor onset. Tumors were measured by caliper beginning 6 days after injection, and volume was calculated as width × length × 0.4. The
mice were euthanized by methoxy-fluorane (Metofane) inhalation when the longest dimension of the largest tumor
reached 1.5 cm or, alternatively, if mice exhibited signs of illness or distress. For each mouse, the tumor and lungs were
excised, divided in half, and processed either for Western
blot or pathologic analysis. Xenografted tumors and both
lungs were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde
for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained
with H&E. Three sections of each lung separated by 1 mm
were evaluated for metastases. Metastases were counted by
a pathologist (A.K.S.), using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope.
The surface area of the lungs was determined with a planimetric software (Image Pro Pus, Media Cybernetics). Metastases were expressed as number of metastases per square
centimeter.
For tail vein injections into SCID mice, 0.35 × 106 cells suspended in 200 μL of PBS were injected per mouse (five mice
per cell line). The SCID mice were monitored daily for signs
of developing tumor burden, such as weight loss, reduced
mobility, hunched posture, and ruffled fur. All mice were sacrificed at the end of week 3, when two mice showed signs of
breathing problems. For each mouse, the lungs were excised,
divided in half, and processed for Western blot or pathologic
analysis.
Biochemical analysis
For Western blot analysis, tumor sections histologically
confirmed to contain >90% tumor tissue were harvested, homogenized, and lysed in PBS-TDS buffer (1× PBS, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20% glycerol) containing complete protease
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostic).
Whole-cell lysates from the MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 −/− and
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines were prepared using CelLytic
MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis/Extraction Reagent (Sigma).
The primary antibodies used were targeted to NEDD9 (2G9;
ref. 5; diluted 1:1,000), p130Cas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
1:1,000), Aurora (BD Biosciences; 1:1,000), phospho-Aurora

(1:1,000), ShcA (1:1,000; Abcam), phospho-ERK1/2-T202/Y204

(1:1,000), AKT (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), phospho-Lyn-Y 507
(1:500), Lyn (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), and β-actin (1:20,000;
Sigma). Secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies were from Pierce Biotechnology. Proteins were visualized using the West-Pico system (Pierce). Image analysis was
done using NIH ImageJ (NIH), with signal intensity normalized to β-actin.

Nedd9 Modulates Tumor Aggressiveness

For in vitro kinase assays, cell lysates prepared from
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− versus MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines
were immunoprecipitated using anti–Aurora A antibody
(BD Transduction Laboratories) and incubated with
[γ-32P]ATP and histone H3 (Upstate) substrate, and standard methods were followed for kinase assay as described
in ref. 5. Aliquots of the reaction mix were used for SDSPAGE and Western blot analysis to confirm levels of AurA
or T288-AurA [using T288 phospho-specific antibody (1:500),
Cell Signaling].
Immunofluorescence
Epifluorescence microscopy was done using an inverted
Nikon TE300 microscope. All images were acquired as
12-bit images with a Spot RT monochrome camera (Diagnostic
Instruments). Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa-488,
Alexa-568, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; to
stain DNA) were from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. To
measure cell spreading, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for
5 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS. Anti-paxillin monoclonal antibodies (BD Transduction
laboratories) were used to mark focal adhesions and outline
cells. Cell area measurements were made for ∼100 cells per
experiment using MetaMorph or MetaVue software (Molecular Devices, Universal Imaging) to score pixels within cell
perimeters.
To count centrosomes and analyze mitotic spindles, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by methanol;
permeabilized with 1% Triton-X100 in PBS; blocked in
1× PBS, 3% BSA; and incubated with antibodies to γ-tubulin
(Sigma; 1:200) and α-tubulin (Sigma; 1:800) to visualize centrosomes and mitotic spindles, respectively.
Statistical analysis
We used Kaplan-Meier curves for survival outcomes. For
figures, we used generalized linear models with restricted
cubic splines estimated by generalized estimating equations. We also used semiparametric regressions and generalized linear mixed effects models. Approaches are similar
to those detailed in ref. 9. Analyses were conducted in R
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and STATA 10
(Stata Corp.).

Results
Lack of NEDD9 increases the aggressiveness of selected
MMTV-PyVT mammary tumor cell lines
We previously compared mammary tumor development
in MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ and MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− mice
(9). This work indicated that tumor development was very
significantly delayed in mice with an MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/−
genotype (P = 0.0001). Based on this observation and additional analysis indicating reduced activation of FAK, Src,
AKT, and ERK1/2 in MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− versus MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ tumor lysates (9) and reduced cell migration
by mammary tumor–derived cell lines lacking Nedd9, we
concluded that NEDD9 acted positively in promoting tu-

mor growth. However, continuing analysis of the data from
the study indicated that although the initial appearance of
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− tumors was delayed, once tumors
had attained palpable mass, the average time until euthanasia was required because of tumor size was similar to
that of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ animals (average, 129 versus
133 days; median, 128 versus 134 days; Fig. 1A).
This adaptation suggested that the absence of NEDD9
might select for compensatory changes that increase
tumor aggression. To test this idea, we used three MMTVPyVT;Nedd9 +/+ and three MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 −/− tumorderived cell lines for orthotopic reinjection into mammary
fat pads and again monitored the growth of tumors (Fig.
1B and C). All three MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines formed
palpable tumors within 14 days (median, 11 days), reaching
maximal size within 40 days after appearance. In contrast,
two of the three MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines yielded
mammary tumors that were detected within 55 days after
injection (median, 33 days) and grew more slowly, whereas
the third cell line failed to form any tumors over a
4-month period (Fig. 1C). In a complementary analysis,
we used four cell lines of each genotype to perform tail
vein injections followed by measurement of metastases in
the lung after 3 weeks. Strikingly, four of four injected
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines generated a large number
of metastases in 20 of 20 injected animals (with an average
of 73 metastases/cm2). In contrast, a single micrometastasis was detected in 1 of 20 mice injected with one of the
four MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines assessed, whereas 19
of 20 mice had none at the same time point (Fig. 1D).
These data clearly supported the idea that the absence
of NEDD9 ultimately selected for more aggressive tumor
growth in vivo.
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells have a consistent growth
advantage on 3D matrices and in soft agar
We had previously determined that MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/−
cell lines were less migratory and more sensitive to
detachment-induced anoikis than MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 +/+
cell lines (9). Given these observations, the most plausible
explanation for the increased aggressiveness of the
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells in vivo would be if they had
undergone specific selection for proliferation in a tumor
microenvironment. To begin assessing this possibility, we
first compared the coefficient of variation in growth rate
in a larger panel of cell lines derived from the two genotypes (Fig. 2A). This analysis indicated that among a group
of 12 cell lines, the range of doubling times of cells cultured
on plastic was significantly greater with the MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− genotype (P < 0.001), with some growing very rapidly and others growing relatively slowly.
Second, the growth of cells on 3D matrices secreted
either by immortalized fibroblast cell lines or by primary
fibroblasts that have been “primed” to support the growth
of tumor cells (i.e., TAFs) can simulate a stromal tumor
microenvironment (18). We compared the proliferation
rates of a set of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 −/− versus MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines cultured on tissue culture plastic,

mammary tumors (3 per genotype) were injected orthotopically into the mammary pads of SCID mice (n = 5 per cell line; 30 mice total). Data shown
represent significant difference in time until appearance of tumors (P = 0.001). C, significant decrease in total tumor burden in SCID mice with tumors

on 3D matrix prepared from NIH3T3 cells, and on 3D
matrix generated from TAFs (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, although
there was no overall statistically significant difference
between the two genotypic groups cultured on plastic (as
both fast-growing and slow-growing MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/−
lines were assessed), all MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines grew
much faster on NIH3T3- or TAF-derived matrix (P < 0.001).
Third, we also compared the growth of MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− versus MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines cultured in
soft agar to fully assess anchorage-independent growth. In
this case, 3 of 4 MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines efficiently
formed large colonies in soft agar, whereas 0 of 4 MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines formed large colonies (Fig. 2C). The
increased growth rate of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− versus MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells on 3D matrices, in soft agar, and in vivo,
coupled with the greater growth variability of MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− cell lines on tissue culture plastic, suggested that
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines may have been more subject
to selective pressures for growth in the in vivo microenvironment, particularly as the effects were seen in early-passage
(<6) populations of cells recovered from tumors.

MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells have more cell cycle,
spindle, and centrosome abnormalities than
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells
To begin to establish the basis for the increased variability in the growth of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells, we directly
assessed whether these cells had signs of increased genomic instability and aneuploidy. Indeed, flow cytometric
analysis (Fig. 3A and data not shown) indicated a greater
proportion of >4N cells and more abnormal profiles in
cells with the MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− genotype. These cells
typically had a much greater number of abnormal mitoses
than MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ lines, including both monopolar
(19% versus 13%, P = 0.002) and multipolar (67% versus
38%, P = 0.001) spindles (Fig. 3B), with consistent increases
observed in all cell lines of the MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 −/−
genotype. Commensurate with this observation, a higher
proportion of these cells had supernumerary centrosomes
(Fig. 3C).
We have previously shown that NEDD9 binds and
controls the activation of the mitotic kinase AurA (5, 6).
Defects in AurA activation are often associated with

centrosomal abnormalities and aneuploidy in human cancers. Intriguingly, we found that the levels of AurA kinase
activity were sharply reduced in MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells
(Fig. 3D, top). Further, and unexpectedly, this activity drop
correlated with a reduction in the overall level of AurA

kinase in this genetic background, rather than a proportional reduction in AurA activity (Fig. 3D, middle). A
NEDD9-dependent decrease in AurA might provide an initiating event for the genomic instability manifested by the
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells. However, overexpression of

neither GFP-Nedd9 nor RFP-AurA in these cell lines reverses the centrosomal abnormalities, implying that at
minimum, other changes in the regulatory machinery
had become critical (Fig. 3D, bottom).

growth, and signs of genomic instability were associated with
loss of AurA. We had previously shown that Src and FAK had
consistently reduced activity in the tumors and derivative
cell lines of MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− mice, whereas Shc, ERK,
and AKT had statistically significant reduced activity in
primary MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− tumors, but greater tumorto-tumor variability (9). We therefore assessed whether

mammary tumor cells positive or negative for NEDD9
displayed different profiles for response to drugs targeting
proteins with which NEDD9 functionally interacts.
Strikingly, MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cell lines were much more
sensitive to dasatinib, an inhibitor of the Src kinases, than were
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells (Fig. 4A). This correlated not only
with a significantly decreased basal ability of MMTV-PyVT;

Nedd9−/− cell lines to spread but also with enhanced inhibition
of spreading following plating in low doses of dasatinib, indicating an inhibition of cytoskeletal rearrangement (Fig. 4B), as
well as with the depressed activation of FAK we had previously
noted in these cell lines (9). Reanalysis of FAK and Src activation in lysates from the primary tumors arising from orthotopic reinjection (Fig. 1B) indicated that activation of Src
remained consistently significantly depressed in tumors of
the MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− genotype, although FAK activation
was similar in tumors of both genotypes (Fig. 4C).
These data suggest that MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells might
be specifically vulnerable to additional dasatinib-based
targeting of Src because of predisposing prior reduction in
pathway activity arising from the absence of the Src partner
NEDD9. If so, and given the prior data suggesting that
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells were more adapted to extrinsic
microenvironment, 3D matrix cues might be expected to
rescue cell growth. Strikingly, plating of cell lines on 3D TAF
matrix produced markedly different results between MMTVPyVT;Nedd9−/− and MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines (compare
Fig. 4D, top and center, with 4A). Although the MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− lines remained more sensitive to dasatinib, overall
IC50 values were significantly increased in 3 of 4 lines (Fig.
4D, bottom). In contrast, MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cell lines as a

group had little responsiveness to 3D TAF matrix, with 3 of 4
lines instead becoming more sensitive to dasatinib.
We also compared the responsiveness of MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− and MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells to C1368, which targets the AurA kinase (Fig. 5A), and erlotinib, which targets
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–dependent signaling (Fig. 5B). In neither case was a specific difference observed, suggesting that the sensitization we observed was
specific for Src. Interestingly, although the activity of the
EGFR effectors ERK, Shc, and AKT had also been depressed
in primary tumors, as in the case with FAK, this was not
observed in tumors arising from orthotopic reinjection (Fig.
5C), in which levels were comparable or higher than that in
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9 −/− cells, and some tumors showed
evidence of recovery of AurA levels (not shown).
Finally, although Src is often considered the primary
physiologic target of dasatinib in solid tumors (19), this
drug can affect other relevant cellular kinases including
Src-family kinases such as LYN (20) as well as c-Kit (19),
EGFR (19), Ephrin (21), and others. Given the close physical
interactions between Nedd9 and Src kinases (1–3), one possibility was that tumors developing in the absence of
NEDD9 might affect the basal expression or activity of
Src-related kinases. We determined that Src and Lyn were

similarly expressed in MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− and MMTVPyVT;Nedd9+/+ cells (Fig. 5D) and also established that the
activation of these kinases was similarly inhibited by dasatinib. The expression and activity of a number of other
dasatinib targets (including EGFR and c-Kit) were also
unaffected by Nedd9 genotype (not shown).

Discussion
The variant proliferation rates, increased percentage of
cells characterized by supernumerary centrosomes, and
anomalous cell cycle compartmentalization in MMTVPyVT;Nedd9−/− tumor-derived cell lines suggest that in each
case, the Nedd9−/− genotype has provided a selection for
mutations in the tumor population. The most direct explanation for this selection lies in the deficient expression and
activation of AurA in Nedd9−/− cells. AurA activation is required for mitotic entry and transit, and we have shown
that siRNA depletion of NEDD9 impairs AurA activation
and mitotic progression, leading to the accumulation of aneuploid binucleate cells (4, 5). Our present data show that
genetic loss of NEDD9 results in a similar phenotype, in
which context it is remarkable that the consequences of a
Nedd9−/− genotype are predominantly restricted to effects
on tumorigenesis. We suggest that this may reflect a specific requirement for Nedd9 scaffolding function in sustaining
the activity and expression of some of its partner proteins
in the constitutive growth environment of a tumor. By contrast, the transient activation of focal adhesion–associated
proteins, such as Src or FAK, in a normally growing or quiescent cellular context may not require NEDD9 interactions
but may be supported by the NEDD9 paralogue BCAR1/
p130Cas (discussed in ref. 22), whereas AurA activation
may be supported by its other partners, such as Ajuba
(23) and Tpx2 (24). The fact that very significant NEDD9
upregulation has been observed in a large subset of aggressive tumors from the lung, breast, and brain (refs. 10, 25, 26;
discussed in ref. 22) and head and neck (27), whereas
BCAR1, Ajuba, FAK, and Tpx2 have not been reported to
be thus overexpressed, is compatible with such a model.
Identifying effective biomarkers for cancer prognosis and
drug responsiveness is of great importance in improving the
clinical management of cancer. Whereas earlier studies focusing on NEDD9 upregulation in tumors suggest that high
NEDD9 levels are specifically associated with poor prognosis
and metastasis, the work presented here and in ref. 9 indicates a more nuanced role for NEDD9 in mammary tumor
biology, in which both elevated or absent levels of Nedd9
may be associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. This
argues against the straightforward consideration of high
NEDD9 levels in tumors as a predictive biomarker. However,
the observation that the absence of NEDD9 greatly sensitizes

cells to the Src-family targeting agent dasatinib is particularly
significant, given the increasing use of dasatinib in the clinic
for treatment of breast (28) and other cancers. MMTV-PyVT;
Nedd9−/− cells maintain persistently low levels of active Src,
suggesting the “double hit” of dasatinib and that a MMTVPyVT;Nedd9−/− genotype is particularly deleterious to cell survival signaling networks. In this context, the modulation of
sensitivity by the 3D matrix produced by TAFs suggests that
in vivo, specific niches of tumor cells may be protected,
whereas other populations may be more vulnerable. Conversely, the subset of metastatic tumors overexpressing
NEDD9 (8, 10, 25, 26, 29) may be particularly resistant to
Src-targeting agents and independent of microenvironment-associated survival cues.
MMTV-PyVT;Nedd9−/− cells do not have increased sensitivity to EGFR- or AurA-targeting agents. In contrast to the
situation with Src, the cells have overcome the inhibition
of the EGFR effectors AKT and ERK observed in primary tumor lysates. Whereas the levels of AurA remain depressed in
these tumors, much of the actual cell killing associated with
Aurora-inhibiting small molecules has been proposed to be
associated with inhibition of Aurora-B, rather than AurA
kinase (30), compatible with our observation that reductions
in AurA expression do not correlate with increased sensitivity
to Aurora-targeting inhibitors. Based on these data, we suggest that NEDD9 may be an excellent candidate to examine
as a modulator of response to dasatinib and potentially other
Src kinase inhibitors in the ongoing clinical development of
this and other Src-targeting agents.
