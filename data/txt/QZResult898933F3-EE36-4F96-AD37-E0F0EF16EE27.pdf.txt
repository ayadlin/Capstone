Abstract:
Glioblastomas (GBM) are associated with high rates of relapse. These brain
tumors are often resistant to chemotherapies like temozolomide (TMZ) and there are
very few treatment options available to patients. We recently reported that polo-like
kinase-1 (PLK1) is associated with the proliferative subtype of GBM; which has the
worst prognosis. In this study, we addressed the potential of repurposing disulfiram
(DSF), a drug widely used to control alcoholism for the past six decades. DSF has
good safety profiles and penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Here we report that
DSF inhibited the growth of TMZ resistant GBM cells, (IC90=100 nM), but did not
affect normal human astrocytes. At similar DSF concentrations, self-renewal was
blocked by ~100% using neurosphere growth assays. Likewise the drug completely
inhibited the self-renewal of the BT74 and GBM4 primary cell lines. Additionally,
DSF suppressed growth and self-renewal of primary cells from two GBM tumors.
These cells were resistant to TMZ, had unmethylated MGMT, and expressed high
levels of PLK1. Consistent with its role in suppressing GBM growth, DSF inhibited
the expression of PLK1 in GBM cells. Likewise, PLK1 inhibition with siRNA, or small
molecules (BI-2536 or BI-6727) blocked growth of TMZ resistant cells. Our studies
suggest that DSF has the potential to be repurposed for treatment of refractory GBM.

INTRODUCTION

methyltransferase (MGMT) avoid growth inhibition
by enzymatically removing the methyl groups added to
DNA by TMZ [2, 3], however, even MGMT silenced
cases acquire TMZ resistance [4]. For example, chronic
exposure to TMZ has been shown to generate mutations
in mismatch repair genes and offers an additional route of
treatment resistance [5]. There are few options available
to overcome GBM growth and recurrence.
Tumor re-growth and relapse is a major problem
in treating GBM. A growing body of genetic analysis of
GBM suggests that cell cycle and regulatory factors are

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type
of brain tumor with limited treatment options. The
location and infiltrative nature of GBM tumors makes
surgical resection and radiation frequently ineffective,
thus recurrence is especially common. Under the current
treatment regime of temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation
the median expected survival following resection is only
14 months [1]. Resistance to the alkylating agent TMZ is
common in GBM. Tumors expressing O6-methylguanine

key drivers of the disease that dictate patient survival
[6-8]. Recently it has become apparent that GBM is
comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of cells that have
different properties that contribute to treatment resistance
in animal models [9-14]. Most current treatments target
the proliferative capacity of cancer cells, however, the
ability of more undifferentiated populations of GBM cells
to self-renew is often unaffected by chemotherapy [15,
16]. Self-renewal is a process that is controlled by cell
cycle and allows the indefinite perpetuation of cells that
are uncommitted to terminal tissue-specific lineages [13,
17-19]. A number of groups have successfully isolated and
characterized GBM cell lines using culture conditions that
retain the self-renewal properties of the primary tumor
[11, 12, 20-22]. Propagation and in vitro assessment of

brain tumor cell self-renewal is done using neurosphere
tissue culture conditions [11, 23, 24]. The self-renewing
properties of cells allow them to be serial passaged
using these growth conditions and continually form new
spheroid cell clusters. With the potential to evade current
treatment protocols, there must be alternative methods
developed that target both the cancer cell proliferation and
self-renewal in order to prevent GBM relapse [9].
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key serine/threonine
kinase involved in many essential cell cycle functions,
such as: mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, cell cycle
progression and cytokinesis [25-29]. Our group has
demonstrated PLK1 to be a promising therapeutic target
for brain tumors as it is highly over-expressed in cancer
compared to normal tissue [30, 31]. As well, patients

with GBM tumors expressing high levels of PLK1 have
a greater probability of morbidity (or poorer prognosis)
[30]. Recently we have shown that PLK1 inhibition
delayed tumor growth in an orthotopic brain tumor model
and also demonstrated PLK1 to be essential for sustaining
the growth of tumorspheres [30]. Although chemical
inhibitors of PLK1 are being developed for clinical use
[32, 33], the long expensive process of drug development
prompts the question of whether currently approved offpatent drugs may have undiscovered anti-cancer potential.
Disulfiram (DSF) has been safely used for the
treatment of alcohol abuse for over sixty years. This
compound is an inhibitor of the aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) enzyme family, which is involved in the
metabolism of alcohol, and has been suggested as a

potential marker for self-renewing tumor cell populations
[34, 35]. Although best characterized for its activity
against ALDH, DSF is not a specific inhibitor and there
is growing support that uncovers alternative effects of
DSF on cell activity [36, 37]. Originally we identified
DSF in a screen for drugs that inhibit tumor-initiating
cells using the Prestwick Library (unpublished data).
DSF was attractive to us because it is a small molecule
and, as such, it crosses the blood-brain barrier [38-40].
In a position paper by Kast et al, DSF was proposed for
the treatment of GBM [41]; therefore, we hypothesize that
DSF will target drug resistant cells. This study provides in
vitro evidence that DSF is an effective treatment for GBM
and suggests it augments cytotoxicity of the currently used
chemotherapeutic agent, TMZ. The data presented here

Figure 2: Freshly isolated GBM cells are sensitive to DSF yet resistant to TMZ. (A) Primary GBM cells referred to aBT001

and aBT003 were isolated from adult patients with GBM. DNA was isolated from the tumors and subjected to MGMT analysis by PCR. In
both cases the MGMT promoter was not methylated indicating that the protein would be expressed (M = methylated, UM = unmethylated).

as an alternative treatment for cancer patients.

treatment and hypoxia [43, 44]. Sequencing of IDH1 and
IDH2 was negative for mutation in either tumor sample
(data not shown). Both cases had unmethylated MGMT
(Figure 2A) suggesting that they may be refractory to
TMZ. As expected, TMZ did not inhibit the growth of
aBT001 in monolayer (Figure 2B). However, these cells
were sensitive to DSF, where 500 nM inhibited growth by
87% after 72 hours (Figure 2C). The aBT003 cells were
also refractory to TMZ in neurosphere assays (Figure 2D).
Conversely, DSF inhibited cell self-renewal capacity by
95-98% (Figure 2D-E). It is noteworthy that while DSF
inhibited the growth of GBM cells it had no effect on the
proliferation of normal human astrocytes at concentrations
up to 10 uM, (Supplemental Figure 3).
We recently reported that highly proliferative
GBM express PLK1 and that these cells depend on it
for survival [30], yet its role in the context of TMZ
resistance has not been addressed. Because DSF had such
a dramatic effect on the growth of GBM we questioned the
mechanism and assessed the impact on PLK1. Notably,
500 nM DSF treatment for 24 hours inhibited PLK1
expression in SF188 cells (Figure 3A), as did 250 nM DSF
(Supplemental Figure 4A). Inhibiting PLK1 with siRNA
blocked the growth of these cells and induced apoptosis
(Figure 3B-C). Similar results were also observed in U251
adult GBM cells as 500 nM DSF inhibited both PLK1
protein and transcript expression (Figure 4A). Lower
doses of 250 nM DSF also inhibited PLK1 protein levels
in the U251 cells (Supplemental Figure 4B). Inhibiting
PLK1 with the small molecule BI-2536 or with siRNA

RESULTS
SF188 cells are pediatric GBM cells that are
unaffected by TMZ at physiologically achievable
concentrations (5-15 uM) based on cell growth assays
(Supplemental Fig 1). These classically TMZ resistant
cells were sensitive to 500 nM DSF, a sufficient
concentration to suppress growth in monolayer by ~100%
over 72 hours (Figure 1A), and the ability of these cells
to self-renew was also completely inhibited (Figure 1B).
BT74 cells are primary adult GBM cells, which are also
refractory to TMZ [21, 42], however, they are sensitive
to DSF in neurosphere self-renewal assays (Figure 1C).
Likewise, GBM4 cells are sensitive to DSF in self-renewal
assays (Figure 1D) and examples of the impact on BT74
and GBM4 neurosphere formation are illustrated in
Figures 1E-F. Next we asked whether the combination
of TMZ and DSF would have an additive cytotoxic
effect. Low doses of 50 nM DSF or 10 uM TMZ had no
effect as single agents, however together they inhibited
proliferation and self-renewal by ~50% (Supplemental
Figure 2A-B).
Freshly isolated GBM cells were obtained from
two adult patients, and denoted aBT001 and aBT003,
respectively. GBM that have mutations in IDH1 or
IDH2 are reported to undergo metabolic remodeling that
influences the tumor survival program in response to

inhibition with siRNA inhibits SF188 cell growth and induced apoptosis based on PARP and caspase 3 cleavage. Scramble RNA oligo was

blocked the U251 cell growth (Figure 4B-C). In addition,
U251 cells treated with 200 nM DSF were suppressed in
growth by 80% and 500 nM doses completely eliminated
the cells (Figure 4D).
Previous published results by our group show
SF188, BT74, BT241 and GBM4 all have between 203470 fold overexpression of PLK1 transcript compared
to normal human astrocytes [30]. In the present study,
it was interesting to find the TMZ resistant SF188 cells
have approximately double the amount of PLK1 transcript
compared to the partially TMZ sensitive U251 cells
(Figure 5A). We notice that while the U251 cells are
reportedly sensitive to TMZ there was always ~30% of
the cells that remained following treatment. For example,
when we treated U251 cells with TMZ for 7 days about
70% of the cells died off leaving behind a residual

population (Figure 5B). This population was harvested
and evaluated for PLK1. Notably the PLK1 was much
higher in the residual population compared to either the
untreated control or the DMSO control (Figure 5C).
Considering these results the study was repeated and the
residual population that remained after treating the cells
with TMZ for 7 day was then exposed to BI-2536. The
TMZ resistant population was highly sensitive to PLK1
inhibition (Figure 5D). For example, 10 nM BI-2536
killed off 90% of the residual population. These findings
suggest PLK1 to be a potential driver of TMZ resistance
that can be overcome through therapeutic intervention.
The TMZ resistant BT74 cells [42] were also
sensitive to PLK1 inhibition (Figure 6A-B). BT241
cells were also sensitive to PLK1 inhibition but not to
TMZ treatment (Figure 6C-D). There was no additional

with BI-2536 or siRNA inhibits their growth. The efficacy of PLK1 inhibition on U251 growth is exemplified in combination with 10 uM
TMZ. (D) Likewise, DSF inhibits the growth of U251 cells in a dose-dependent manner using DMSO as a solvent control.

benefit from combining BI-2536 and TMZ (Figure 6AD). As previously mentioned freshly isolated aBT001
and aBT003 GBM cells were sensitive to DSF therefore
we addressed whether they also expressed PLK1, which
they did (Figure 7A-B). Given that the PLK1 target
was expressed, aBT001 cells were treated for 72 hours
with increasing amounts of BI-2536 that inhibited their
growth by up to 80% and induced apoptosis (Figure 7C).
Thus, PLK1 inhibition phenocopied the effect of DSF in
blocking the growth of refractory GBM cells.

some patients, the invasive tumor cells respond initially
but most patients eventually relapse. For other patients,
their tumors are resistant from the start of treatment. TMZ
treatment is associated with low long-term survival rate
and is ineffective at targeting cancer cell self-renewal that
potentially repopulates the tumor [1, 45, 46]. In the present
study, we demonstrate the efficacy of DSF in completely
suppressing GBM cell growth in vitro. More importantly,
we observed the same degree of inhibition in self-renewal
assays. Concentrations as low as 100nM DSF suppressed
cell growth in monolayer and this corresponded to an
inhibition of self-renewal using neurosphere assays.
Importantly, DSF was highly effective in cells that are
refractory to TMZ.
Of notable importance, we showed that DSF was

DISCUSSION
Many challenges exist in the treatment of GBM, one
of which is the immense problem of TMZ resistance. In

highly effective in situations where cells have developed
TMZ resistance. Within this study we note that the
treatment of cells with DSF results in downregulation of
the important cell cycle kinase, PLK1. We have shown
that TMZ treatment induces expression of PLK1 protein
and speculate this phenomenon may have a role in the
aggressive nature of recurrent GBM. It is interesting
to note that TMZ resistant SF188 cells were found to
have double the PLK1 transcript expression as partially
TMZ sensitive U251 cells. Therefore, DSF has very
promising potential for treatment of brain tumor patients.
The combination of TMZ and DSF was helpful in some
instances but not others. Several other studies showed
that DSF was added to standard cancer chemotherapy
agents: paclitaxel [47], gemcitabine [48], docetaxel [49],
cyclophosphamide [50], and 5-fluorouracil [51]. This
data also agrees with an in vitro study considering DSF
toxicity to breast cancer stem cells [47]. Similarly, we
show enhanced cytotoxicity to TMZ and investigate the
use of DSF to target self-renewing primary cells.
DSF is being evaluated for other malignancies
including an ongoing phase I clinical trial investigating the

use of DSF to treat malignancies that have metastasized
to the liver (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00742911).
Another phase II trial is evaluating its use in combination
with cisplatin for treating metastatic small cell lung
carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00312819).
Verma et al. (1990) has also conducted phase II clinical
trials of DSF as a method to decrease nephrotoxicity
of cisplatin in a randomized study of cisplatin sensitive
malignancies [52]. They reported no reduction in toxicity
by combining the two drugs, however, this study had
a markedly high patient drop- out rate making the data
analysis inconsistent between groups [52]. It may be
speculated that this study had issues due to the use of
extremely high concentrations of greater than 3200 mg
DSF. This level far exceeds the minimal concentrations
required to elicit a response as suggested by our in vitro
data, and is dangerously higher than the dose of 250mg/
day used to treat alcoholism [52, 53]. At this point there
has been no reported clinical experimentation in the use
of DSF for the treatment of solid brain tumors with DSF
only being used in clinical trials for metastatic cancers. We
believe that DSF may have great benefit if used to treat

primary tumors for a number of reasons. Not only is DSF
an inexpensive and easily administered drug, it is able to
cross the blood-brain barrier, which is a major limitation
in brain therapeutic design [39, 40, 54].
In the context of this study, the mechanism of
action for DSF was somewhat elusive for us. Other
researchers speculate that metal chelating properties of
DSF metabolites cause the initiation of apoptosis through
redox induced oxidative stress [55]. Another theory is that
these metal chelating properties cause the inhibition of the
proteasome; a multisubunit complex involved with protein
degradation pathways [56]. Studies in breast cancer
suggest that DSF may modulate the NFκB pathway, which
is a very often inappropriately activated in GBM, and is
regulated in a proteasome dependent manner [47, 57].
These studies were conducted using the combination of
DSF with the metal ions (eg. CuCl2), however, here we
demonstrate exceptional activity of DSF in the absence
of metal supplementation and question an alternative

mechanism of action for DSF on cancer cells.
We initially suspected that DSF killed cells through
ALDH inhibition [34]; however, this was not the case.
We noted that while DSF inhibits ALDH activity it was
at higher doses of the drug then required to suppress
the growth of GBM cells. Additionally, blocking ALDH
activity with a pan inhibitor (DEAB) did not suppress
growth to the degree of DSF. ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3
isoforms were also individually silenced with siRNA
however this resulted in little or no growth suppression
(data not shown) and loss of ALDH did not induce cell
death in GBM cells. These studies redirected our focus
toward a pathway that may cause considerable cell death
and to this end we address the possible link with PLK1.
We knew that GBM cells were absolutely dependent upon
PLK1 as we recently reported that inhibiting expression
suppressed the growth of GBM cells by as much as
100% and this was associated with cell death [30].
Serendipitously we noted that DSF also inhibited PLK1

Figure 7: aBT001 and aBT003 express high levels of PLK1. (A) PLK1 levels were assessed in aBT001 and aBT003 by
immunostaining. Both cases express high levels of PLK1. (B-C) The PLK1 inhibitor BI-2536 suppressed the growth of aBT001 and

expression in both SF188 and U251 cells. This novel
mechanism would have broad reaching implications given
that PLK1 is central to the growth of many types of cancer
[30, 58-60]. This is the first demonstration of an off-patent
drug that inhibits its expression and as such it opens up
several new lines of investigation.
In the present study we demonstrated the efficacy
of DSF in suppressing refractory GBM growth and
self-renewal at low concentrations. Coupled with these
findings, DSF has been used safely in humans for over
half a century and therefore we believe it has excellent
potential to be repositioned for the treatment of GBM.

room temperature for 30 minutes before a wash with 100
μl PBS. Plate analysis and image capture was done using
an ArrayScan VTI Reader (Thermal Fisher) [31]. Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to reconstitute TMZ and DSF
and was used as a solvent control. Ethanol was used as a
control for DEAB.
For analysis of effect of BI-2536 on U251 TMZ
resistant cells, U251 cells were treated with 10 uM of TMZ
(or DMSO) every 2 days for a total of 7 days. The cells
were harvested for protein extraction and immunoblotting
was done to examine PLK1 expression. The cells were
then re-plated and treated with increasing concentrations
of BI-2536 (5-100 nM) for 5 days before the cells were
stained with Hoechst dye and quantified on Cellomics. The
effect of PLK1 inhibition was investigated using siRNA or
BI-2536 as previously described [30].

METHODS
Cell culture

Neurosphere Assay

The American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC)
supplied pediatric GBM SF188 (TMZ resistant), adult
GBM U251 (partial TMZ sensitivity), and normal
human astrocyte cells. GBM4 and BT74 GBM cells are
well-established GBM models that were obtained from
Wakimoto et al. [20, 21, 42, 61] (BT74 cells originally
isolated and characterized by James CD et al, and denoted
as GBM6 [21]). BT241 is another primary isolate model
that was isolated from a patient with GBM, and obtained
from Singh et al [11, 62]. GBM4, BT74 and BT241 cells
have all been previously characterized both in vitro and
in vivo using xenograft experiments [11, 20-22, 62].
Primary patient isolated cells, aBT001 and aBT003, were
isolated using methods previously described [22, 63]. All
primary samples were acquired in accordance with the
guidelines of the Institutional Review Board, and along
with patient consent. SF188, U251, and aBT001 cells were
grown in monolayer using Minimum Essential Medium/
Earle’s Balanced Salt Solutions (MEM/EBSS) [Hyclone,
Logan UT, USA] and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM)/High Glucose (Hyclone), respectively,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). BT74,
aBT003, and sphere assays were grown non-adherently
using NeuralBasal medium with Neurocult supplement
and growth factors, EGF (20ng/ml), FGF (20ng/mL) and
heparin (2mg/mL). Normal human astrocytes were grown
in Astrocyte medium (ScienCell cat. #1801) on adherent
plants coated with poly-L-lysine (ScienCell cat. #0413).

Self-renewal in BT74, GBM4 and SF188 cells
was examined using a neurosphere suspension assay
(Note: BT74 and GBM4 cells are always maintained as
spheres as were the primary isolates described below).
Approximately 10 000 cells/well were plated into a
low adherent 6 well dish using neurobasal medium
supplemented with human recombinant EGF (20 ng/ml),
human recombinant FGF (20 ng/ml) and heparin (2 μg/
ml) [Stem Cell Technologies]. Primary samples were
obtained from adult patients under informed consent
according to the BC Cancer Agency guidelines. Tumor
cells were isolated as previously described by us [30].
Neurospheres were grown for 5-6 days following plating.
Spheres >30 μm were counted and photographed using
an Aniovert 40CFL microscope and AxioCam MRc
camera. NeuroCult Chemical Dissociation kit (Stem Cell
Technologies, cat. #05707) was used to passage cells,
which are counted and replated as single cells. All drug
treatments of TMZ and DSF were done at the time of
plating, and repeated during serial passaging.

PLK1 regulation and expression
SF188 or U251 cells were treated with DSF (100500 nM) for 24 hours, proteins were harvested and levels
of PLK1 were evaluated by immunoblotting. RNA for
gene expression analysis was isolated using Qiagen
RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat. #74106). Transcript expression was
determined using qRT-PCR with PLK1 Assay on Demand
(Applied Biosystems, cat. #4331182). PLK1 expression
was silenced using siRNA as previously described [30].
Tumor cell growth following siPLK1 transfection was
evaluated compared to scramble control RNA in SF188
cells. PLK1 was also inhibited with BI-2536 and growth
was assessed in SF188, BT74, and BT241 all of which are
TMZ resistant.

Drug treatment and growth assay
Growth assays were conducted by plating 1000
cells/well in 96-well plates with a range of concentrations
of TMZ or DSF. All treatments were done in triplicate, and
plates incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 72
hours, cells are fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in 100μl
PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (2 μg/ml) at
