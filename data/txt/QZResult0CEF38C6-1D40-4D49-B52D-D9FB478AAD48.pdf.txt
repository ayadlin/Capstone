ABSTRACT
A variety of melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) protein are commonly
detected in lung cancers. Their biological function is not well characterized but may
involve cell cycle progression and the regulation of apoptosis. We hypothesized
that MAGE-A9 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. To test this hypothesis,
we evaluated MAGE-A9 protein expression by immunohistochemical staining and we
assessed the relationship between the expression of MAGE-A9 and clinical pathological
parameters. In addition, we investigated the effect of MAGE-A9 down-regulation in
lung adenocarcinoma. The results showed that a high expression level of MAGE-A9
protein in lung adenocarcinoma tumor cells was related to larger tumor diameter
(P = 0.013) and poor differentiation (P = 0.029). Cox regression analysis revealed
that the expression of MAGE-A9 in lung adenocarcinoma tumor cells (P < 0.001) is an
independent prognostic factor in five-year survival rates. NSCLC cells with silenced
MAGE-A9 had decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in cell culture
compared to corresponding control cells. The NSCLC cells showing down-regulated
MAGE-A9 induced the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. In addition,
MAGE-A9 was associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
Our findings provide evidence that MAGE-A9 could be a potential therapeutic target
in NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

transfer technology, gene- targeted therapy is expected to
become the good treatment for NSCLC [6]. Therefore, it
is necessary to explore novel biological molecular markers
for predicting the progression of NSCLC and aiding
targeted therapy.
The MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) gene is
part of a group of tumor-associated antigens and was the
first discovered for melanoma. The family is composed
of genes that all share a homologous MAGE-conserved
domain of approximately 200 amino acids. In humans,
the family contains 37 protein-coding genes. Based on
differences in tissue-specific gene expression and gene
structure, MAGE genes are classified as type I (MAGE-A,
MAGE-B, and MAGE-C) and type II (MAGE-D,
MAGE-E, MAGE-F, MAGE-H, MAGE-L and NDN)
genes [7–8]. Type II MAGEs are almost universally
expressed in normal tissues and cancer cells [9–10]. Type

Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring
type of cancer and is the leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide. Lung cancer can be divided into two types:
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) [1–3]. The prognosis for NSCLC
patients is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis.
Despite efforts to develop early screening tools, a
majority of tumors are detected at an advanced stage,
and approximately 85% of these cancers are identified
as NSCLC [3–4]. Although multi-model treatment
strategies including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy
and immunotherapy are used, the prognosis of these
patients remains poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate
of approximately 10% and a median survival time of 16
to 18 months [2, 5]. With recent developments in gene

I MAGE genes expression is restricted to a small number
of normal tissues such as spermatocytes, placenta, and
certain stages of embryonic development [9–10]. Type
I MAGE genes are silent or expressed at low levels in
normal adult tissues but are re-expressed in selected
tumor types [11– 12]. Because of this particular expression
pattern, type I MAGE genes are categorized as members
of the cancer/testis antigen (CTAg) gene family [13–15].
Its potential immunogenicity offers possible research
directions that may lead to a therapeutic vaccine [16–19].
Because MAGE genes are not expressed in normal adult
tissues, except in testes and placenta, where they are
expressed in a large variety of neoplastic lesions, MAGE
genes are considered tumor-specific antigens and ideal
targets for cancer immunotherapy [20–21]. These antigens
are presented on the cell surface by MHC-II molecules and
identified by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Therefore,
this is an ideal target molecule for CTL mediated-specific
immune therapy [22–23].
MAGE-A is a multigene family consisting of 12
homologous genes MAGE-A1 to MAGE-A12 located
at chromosome Xq28 [15, 24]. Studies have shown
some of the MAGE-A genes are expressed in NSCLC
and have become targets for lung cancer immunotherapy [25–27]. MAGE-A9 is frequently expressed in
urinary tumors and can provide prognostic information
in bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma. In addition,
MAGE-A9 is overexpressed in laryngeal squamous cell

carcinoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, esophageal
adenocarcinomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma [28–34].
To the best of our knowledge, MAGE-A9 expression in
lung adenocarcinoma and its correlation with clinical
parameters have not been evaluated to date. Thus, we
detected MAGE-A9 expression in lung adenocarcinoma
samples to analyze the associations between MAGE-A9
expression and clinicopathologic data in a group of
patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we
explored the effect of MAGE-A9 silencing in vitro.

RESULTS
The expression of MAGE-A9 in lung
adenocarcinoma by IHC analysis
Our previous research showed high expression
of MAGE-A9 in tumor and stromal cells of non-small
cell lung correlates with poor survival [35]. Here we
performed IHC analysis to examine MAGE-A9 expression
in lung adenocarcinoma. Positive staining for MAGE-A9
was mainly localized to tumor cells in the cytoplasm and
the nucleus at different levels. High MAGE-A9 expression
was detected in 42.78% of lung adenocarcinoma tissues
(77/180) compared to 22.34% of matched tumor-adjacent
tissues (21/94) (χ2 = 11.226, P = 0.001). Typical IHC
staining patterns for MAGE-A9 in lung adenocarcinoma
are shown in Figure 1.

The association between MAGE-A9 expression
and clinicopathological parameters

blot analysis identified MAGE-A9#3 as the most potent
sequence for silencing (Figure 3B). We transfected
MAGE-A9#3 siRNA into SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1975 cell
lines, which had shown high MAGE-A9 protein expression.
The transfected cells were named SPC-A-1-MAGE-A9 and
NCI-H1975-MAGE-A9, and the corresponding negative
controls were named SPC-A-1-NC and NCI-H1975-NC.
Subsequently, we evaluated the cell proliferation,
migration and invasion of the two experimental cell
lines. Cell lines silenced with MAGE-A9 siRNA (SPCA-1-MAGE-A9 and NCI-H1975-MAGE-A9) had lower
proliferative abilities than the corresponding controls and
normal controls (Figure 3C and 3D). In the migration
and invasion assays, fewer SPC-A-1-MAGE-A9 and
NCI-H1975-MAGE-A9 cells migrated through the
membrane in the migration chamber with or without the
Transwell-precoated Matrigel compared to corresponding
control cells (Figure 3E and 3F) , and the difference was
statistically significant (P < 0.05). These results indicated
that silencing of MAGE-A9 expression decreased the cell
proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells.

The relationship between high MAGE-A9
expression and the clinicopathological features in 180
cases of lung adenocarcinoma are shown in Table 1. The
high expression of MAGE-A9 in lung adenocarcinoma
tumors was significantly associated with differentiation
(χ2 = 4.759, P = 0.029) and tumor diameter (χ2 = 6.205,
P =  0.013). By contrast, no statistically significant
association was found for gender, age, lymph-node
metastasis and TNM Classification.

Survival analysis
Several known predictive factors of poor outcome
in NSCLC were assessed to confirm that our cohort
of patients was representative of those with NSCLC
(Table 2). As expected, MAGE-A9 protein overexpression
(P  <  0.001) was significantly associated with 5-year
survival by Cox regression univariate analysis. In addition,
correlations with other prognostic factors such as gender
(P = 0.002), tumor diameter (P = 0.001), differentiation
(P = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) and TNM
classification (P = 0.001) were also statistically significant.
All of these factors were included in a multivariable
analysis. High MAGE-A9 expression in tumor tissue
(P < 0.001), male (P = 0.007), poor differentiation
(P = 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.037) were
identified as independent predictive factors in the poor
outcome of lung adenocarcinoma. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves again showed that high MAGE-A9 expression
corresponded with a significantly shorter survival time
compared with those showing no or low MAGE-A9
protein expression (Figure 2).

MAGE-A9 expression and apoptosis
To explore the underlying mechanism by which
MAGE-A9 induces lung tumor growth, apoptosisassociated protein expression was analyzed in MAGE-A9
silenced cells. Expressions of the pro-apoptotic protein
Bax, Caspase- 3, Caspase-7, Caspase-9 and Apoptosis
Western Blot Cocktail were increased at different degrees
in SPC-A-1-MAGE-A9 and NCI-H1975-MAGE-A9 cells,
compared to corresponding control cells (Figure 4A). Our
results suggest that silencing MAGE-A9 expression might
promote apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

MAGE-A9 overexpression confers resistance to
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis

The association of MAGE-A9 expression with
NSCLC

We investigated the association between MAGE-A9
expression and chemoresistance to four chemotherapeutic
agents in NSCLC cells and explored whether MAGE-A9
plays a role in drug-induced apoptosis. MAGE-A9
depletion in SPCA-1-MAGE-A9 and NCI-H1975MAGE-A9 cells contributed to an increased apoptotic
response to various levels of chemotherapeutic reagents that
are commonly used for lung cancer including GEM, DDP,
Taxol and PEM (Figure 4B and 4C: P < 0.05, part data
not shown). Specifically, the IC50 in SPC-A-1-MAGE-A9
and NCI-H1975-MAGE-A9 cells was lower than in control
cells (Figure 4D P < 0.05). Hence, the down-regulation of
MAGE-A9 might increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells
to chemotherapeutic reagents and may be related to our
above demonstration that decreased MAGE-A9 expression
could induce tumor cell apoptosis.

We examined MAGE-A9 protein expression in
four NSCLC cell lines (SPC-A-1, A549, NCI-H1975
and NCI-H1650). Western blot results showed higher
expression of MAGE-A9 in the SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1975
cell lines than in the A549 and NCI-H1650 cell lines
(Figure 3A).

DISCUSSION

It has been reported that MAGE expression is
directly regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-34a, and
that MAGE-A proteins can inhibit p53 function through
direct and indirect mechanisms. The p53 tumor suppressor
plays a protective in some tumors by coordinating changes
in gene expression, which can lead to the elimination
of cancer cells. Mage-A may block the association of
p53 with its cognate sites in chromatin. Silencing of
Mage-A expression leads to the up-regulation of several
p53- 
responsive genes. These data reveal the novel
mechanism by which Mage-A may suppress the p53
transcriptional program during tumor development [41].
MAGE-A inhibited apoptosis in proliferating malignancy
cells through at least two novel mechanisms: inhibition of
the up-regulation of Bax by a p53-dependent mechanism
and maintenance of survivin expression by p53-dependent

Lung cancer is diagnosed at an advanced stage in
most patients, which is the primary reason for the high
mortality rate. Therefore, early detection of lung cancer
is a major issue. New molecular targets for diagnosis and
therapy are urgently needed to improve the prognosis for
lung cancer patients. Recently, MAGE-A family members
have been identified as promising immunotherapeutic
targets for tumor therapy because they are strictly tumor
specific [36–37]. Several basic clinical studies involving
melanoma, esophagus cancer and lung cancer have utilized
MAGE-A antigens and have shown encouraging results
[38–40]. Although the normal physiological function of
MAGE-A antigens remains unknown, their contribution to
tumor development has been investigated recently.

and independent mechanisms. Silencing of MAGE-A
resulted in a loss of p53 ubiquitination and stabilization
of p53 protein, thereby increasing the expression of Bax.
Survivin was down-regulated in tumor cells after MAGE-A
silencing regardless of the p53 status. These results strongly
suggest that MAGE-A is an antagonist of p53- dependent
pro-apoptotic transcriptional regulation [42].
In this present investigation, MAGE-A9 protein
expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues was evaluated

using IHC, and the results showed that 42.78% of the
cases exhibited high MAGE-A9 cytoplasmic and nuclear
expression. Consistent with a previous study, our results
support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic and nuclear
MAGE-A9 expression is present in renal cell carcinoma
[30]. Furthermore, we found that high MAGE-A9
expression in lung adenocarcinoma was significantly
correlated with differentiation and tumor diameter. For
survival analysis, our data clearly showed that high

expression of MAGE-A9 is an independent predictive
factor of poor outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma. These
results were in agreement with previous studies in renal cell
carcinoma [30] and bladder cancer [43]. A Kaplan-Meier
analysis also verified that lung adenocarcinoma patients
with high MAGE-A9 expression showed a significantly
unfavorable life span.
Our in vitro findings shed light on how MAGE-A9
promotes NSCLC tumor progression. Four NSCLC cell
lines were used to model the potential proliferative role
of MAGE-A9 silencing in NSCLC. The functional effects
of MAGE-A9 knockdown in two high-expression cell
lines were consistent: decreased proliferation, migration
and Matrigel invasion. These findings are consistent with
recent studies, which report MAGE-A9 overexpression
in breast cancer [44–45] and bladder cancer [43] and
identify MAGE-A9-enhanced tumorigenicity and tumor
growth. Although the physiological role of MAGE-A
proteins remains largely unknown, it has been shown
that DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation
is the underlying mechanism responsible for MAGE-A9
gene silencing [44]. Increasingly, evidence suggests
the involvement of DNA hypermethylation and histone
deacetylation in the early carcinogenesis of the lung,

involving the regulation of apoptosis and cell-cycle
progression [46–47]. MAGE-A proteins are also more
frequently expressed in chemotherapy (paclitaxel)
resistance compared with chemotherapy-susceptible
ovarian cancer, melanoma and multiple myeloma cell
lines [48]. We observed that down-regulated MAGE-A9
expression promoted the sensitivity of four typical
chemotherapeutic agents and inhibited the growth of
cancer cells. These findings suggest that MAGE-A
expression favors tumor-cell survival and that MAGE-A
proteins function as oncoproteins. MAGE-A9 may play
a key role in drug resistance in human cancer, and this
likely occurs via multiple mechanisms. These data indicate
that MAGE-A9 is critical for the survival of proliferating
NSCLC cells and that MAGE-A9 is a promising
therapeutic target for this disease. Hence, our study
might open up a novel strategy for future cancer therapies
through the modulation of cellular MAGE-A9 activities.
In summary, we confirmed the significant
up-regulation of MAGE-A9 proteins in lung
adenocarcinoma tissues and found that high expression
levels are associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, we
revealed that RNA interference of MAGE-A9 inhibited
the proliferation, invasion and migration of NSCLC cell

lines and restrained the tumorigenesis and development of
NSCLC. Decreased MAGE-A9 expression could induce
apoptosis as it occurs in NSCLC cells. Finally, MAGE-A9
might be associated with resistance to conventional
chemotherapy, and down-regulation of MAGE-A9 may
increase the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic reagents,
which has important implications for cancer progression
and treatment.
There are some limitations to this study. For example,
overexpression of the MAGE-A9 gene has not been
explored. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying
MAGE-A9 involvement in cell proliferation, migration and
chemosensitivity should be analyzed in vivo. If the results from
further investigations support our findings, a strategy that targets
MAGE-A9 might be expected to establish a high efficacy
chemo-immunotherapeutic approach.

staining was recorded as a percentage (0–100%). Staining
intensity was graded on a scale of 0 (negative) to 3 (strong).
The final MAGE-A9 staining score was a product of the
intensity grading and the percentage of positive cells [49].
The cutoff point for the MAGE-A9 expression score that
was statistically significant, in terms of overall survival
(OS), was set using the X-tile software program (The Rimm
Lab at Yale University, New Haven, CT) as described
previously [50]. The degree of MAGE-A9 staining was
quantified using a two-level grading system, and staining
scores were defined as follows: 0–100, no expression to
low expression; and 101–300, high expression.

Cell lines and cell culture
Human NSCLC cell lines A549, SPC-A-1,
NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1650 were purchased from the
Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai, China. All cell lines were maintained
in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan City, Utah,
USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), and cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and resources
A panel of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung
adenocarcinoma tissues (n = 180) and corresponding
peritumoral normal tissues (n = 94) were excised
from fresh surgical samples at the Affiliated Hospital
of Nangtong University from 2004 to 2010. Clinical
data (including age, gender, differentiation, tumor
size, five- year follow-up survival records and other
information) were obtained from the medical records of
each patient. The average age of the group was 61.25 years
(range 35–81 years). The 5-year actuarial overall survival
was calculated from the date of surgery until the date
of death or the last follow-up appointment. All patients
were typed in accordance with the recent TNM stage
classification system (UICC 2009). None of the patients
received chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery.
Representative 2.0 mm tissue cores from each sample
were used to conduct TMA analysis (Shanghai Outdo
Biotech, Shanghai, China). The study was approved by
the Ethical Research Committee of the hospital.

Western blot analysis
Total protein extracts from each cell line were
obtained using a lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, China), and the protein concentration
was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit with
bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (Thermo
Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (20 μL per lane)
were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) in 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to
polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore
Corporation, USA) at 300 mA for 2 h. The membrane
was blocked in 5% fat-free milk and incubated with the
following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: mouse
monoclonal anti-MAGE-A9 (1:300 dilution; Abcam),
rabbit monoclonal anti-Bax (1:1000 dilution; Abcam),
rabbit polyclonal anti- Caspase3 (1:300 dilution; Abcam),
rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspase7 (1:1000 dilution; Abcam),
rabbit monoclonal anti-Caspase9 (1:1000 dilution; Abcam)
and Apoptosis Western Blot Cocktail (1:250 dilution;
Abcam). The secondary antibodies were horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody
(1:1000, Proteintech group, USA) and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)- conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(1:1000, Proteintech group, USA). After stripping, the
membrane was reprobed with β-actin (1:1000, Proteintech
group, USA) overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with
a secondary antibody as stated above at room temperature
for 2 h. Bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (ECL, Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology). The data were quantified by densitometry.

Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, tissue sections
were deparaffinized in 100% xylene and rehydrated in
graded ethanol solutions. Antigen retrieval was performed
by boiling in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 5 minutes in a
pressure cooker. Sections were incubated with a primary
anti-MAGE-A9 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK)diluted
1:100 in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4°C
overnight and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated antibody at 37°C for 30 min.
MAGE-A9 immunostaining was evaluated independently
by two trained pathologists who had no knowledge of the
clinical background of the cases. The positivity of cell

Chemotherapeutic cell treatments

Three different siRNA sequences targeting human
MAGE-A9 and negative control siRNA were designed by,
and obtained from, Shanghai Invitrogen Corporation. The
sequences of Si-MAGE-A9 were as follows: MAGE-A9#1
sense, 5′-GGUGGCUGAGUUGGUUCAUTT-3′ and
antisense,
5′-AUGAACCAACUCAGCCACCTT-3′;
MAGE-A9#2 sense, 5′-GCAAAGCCUCCGAGUUCAU
TT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AUGAACUCGGAGGCUUUGC
TT-3′; MAGE-A9#3 sense, 5′-CCAGCUAUGAGAAGGU
CAUTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AUGACCUUCUCAUAGCU
GGTT-3′. Cells were then transfected with Lipofectamine™
2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Gemcitabine (GEM), cisplatin (DDP), paclitaxel
(Taxol), and pemetrexed (PEM) were used at 0.1–100 μM
to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values in cell lines, in which MAGE-A9 was
silenced, and their corresponding controls cells. Cells
(5 × 103) were added to each well in a 96-well plate
and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then treated with
drugs for 12 h, and the medium was replaced by
fresh medium without drugs for an additional 48 h.
Cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit8 (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) at 450 nm as
stated above. DMSO treatment was used as a control.
The survival of each cell line was compared with their
corresponding control cell line. Assays were repeated three
times.

Cell proliferation assays

Statistical analysis

Cell proliferation was evaluated using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the NSCLC cells, negative control
cells and normal control cells (5 × 103), in 100 μL of
medium per well, were seeded into 96-well plates (three
wells per each group); 10 μL of CCK8 solution was
added to the culture medium in each well, and cells were
incubated for 3 h. The absorbance was determined at a
wavelength of 450 nm. The assays were repeated three
times with triplicate samples.

Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
V.20.0 software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and the
STATA V.9.0 software (Stata Corporation). χ2 tests were
performed to evaluate whether MAGE-A9 expression was
correlated with clinicopathological factors. For the TMA
slides, the following clinical data were assessed: gender, age,
tumor diameter, and other clinicopathological information.
Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. The factors shown to be of prognostic significance
in the univariate models were evaluated in a multivariable
Cox regression model. For all statistical analyses, P-values
less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. All
statistical tests were two-sided.

Transwell migration and invasion assays
For the analysis of cell invasion assays, modified
Boyden chambers consisting of Matrigel-precoated
Transwell membrane filter inserts with 8 μm pores were
used in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA). Cells from different groups (1 × 105)
were plated onto the top of the chamber in RPMI-1640
without FBS, and the bottom chamber was filled with
RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant.
After 24 h of incubation in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber
at 37°C, noninvading cells were removed by wiping the
upper surface of the membrane with a cotton swab, and
the filter membrane was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with Exam MaSiLiang blue. The degree of
invasion was quantified by counting the cells that had
migrated through the membrane in at least six random
fields (total magnification, ×200) per filter. Experiments
were repeated three times in triplicate.
For cell migration, we used the modified Boyden
chambers without the Matrigel-precoated Transwell
membrane filter, using the method stated above.
