BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests are commonly used to assess human
epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status of tumors in patients with breast cancer. This analysis evaluates the likely cost-effectiveness
of expanded retesting to assess HER2 tumor status in women with early stage breast cancer. METHODS: We developed a decisionanalytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of expanded reflex testing from a US payer perspective.
Expanded reflex testing is defined as retesting tumor specimens from patients whose tumors are IHC0, IHC11, or FISH-negative on
their first test. In the base case, we assumed that 80% of patient tumors are initially IHC-tested and 20% are FISH-tested. Testing outcomes for IHC and FISH with and without retesting were based on published meta-analyses. The cost of tests and treatment and the
long-term health outcomes were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, we estimated that 2.27% of women who
received expanded reflex testing would be HER2-positive and receive trastuzumab treatment: the projected ICER was $36,721 per life
year or $39,745 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This varied between $47,100 per QALY and $35,500 per QALY if we assumed
that 1%-8% of patients retested were then HER21, respectively. The results of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were
robust. This strategy would result in 4700 (2000-17,000) patients being eligible to receive trastuzumab treatment annually. CONCLUSIONS: Retesting patients who are IHC0, IHC11, or FISH-negative is projected to be a cost-effective clinical strategy. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women, is responsible for approximately 15% of cancer
deaths in the United States.1 It is estimated that in 2013 there will be 232,340 cases of invasive breast cancer in the United
States and that 39,620 women will die from the disease.1
Approximately 20% of patients with breast cancer have human epidermal growth factor 2(HER2)-positive disease,
which is associated with a poor prognosis.2-4 HER2-positive tumors are also responsive to treatment with trastuzumab
(Herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2, reducing the risk of recurrence and improving survival.5,6
Two pathological diagnostic tests are commonly used to test for HER2 status: immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC measures HER2 overexpression and is simple to implement, available in
most laboratories, and relatively inexpensive. However, tissue handling and fixation, including time to fixation and fixation time, as well as test sensitivity and specificity can affect accuracy. FISH measures HER2 gene amplification and is less
susceptible to tissue handling and fixation problems,7 but it is more complicated, requires training and experience, and is
more expensive. The IHC test is scored as follows: 0 and 11, negative; 21, equivocal; and 31, positive. The FISH test
can also be positive, equivocal, or negative depending on the gene/chromosome 17 ratio (ie, a ratio of <1.8 is negative, a
ratio of 1.8-2.2 is equivocal, and a ratio of >2.2 is positive). Because of the poor correlation between weak positivity by
IHC21 and FISH positivity,8 it is currently recommended that patients who are IHC21 are considered to be equivocal
and are reflex-tested with FISH to determine HER2 status.

Original Article

Tumors of approximately 80% of new invasive
breast cancer patients are tested for HER2 using IHC and
20% are tested using FISH.9 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the College of American
Pathologists (CAP), and other groups recommend treating patients whose tumors test IHC31 or FISH-positive
with trastuzumab, treating patients whose tumors are
IHC0 or 11 or FISH-negative with standard chemotherapy and retesting tumors that test IHC21. ASCO and
CAP also recommend either using IHC assays for initial
evaluation of HER2 status followed by reflex testing by
FISH of some IHC categories or primary use of FISH in
initial testing.10,11 While concordance (defined as the
number of patients who test the same on both tests)
between unequivocal IHC and FISH results can be as
high as 96%,12 recent studies have suggested that significant discordance remains.12,13
Intratumoral discordance between test results may
lead to false-negative results for HER2 overexpression status. Patients with a false-negative tumor result would be
denied the clinical benefits of treatment with trastuzumab,
which could have serious morbidity and mortality consequences. An additional important finding is that 2 large
randomized trials now suggest that IHC-positive, FISHnegative patients demonstrate clinical benefit when treated
with trastuzumab with a hazard ratio similar to that seen in
patients whose tumors are both IHC- and FISH-positive.14
Finally, because of a small rate of discordance between
IHC and FISH, some tumors may be positive by 1 test and
negative by the second test, and a tumor may be mistakenly
classified as HER2-negative if it falls into this category.
Expanded reflex testing, as depicted in Figure 1, would
reduce the likelihood of this occurrence.
Expanded reflex testing, represented schematically
in Figure 2, implies taking a “believe the positive”
approach (supported by extensive data) in which patients
testing positive by either test would receive treatment with
trastuzumab and patients testing negative by either test
(IHC0, IHC11, or FISH-negative) would receive the opposite test for confirmation. This would expand the categories of patients receiving additional testing for HER2
status, and the result would be a substantial reduction in
patients with false-negative results (who would have been
denied the benefits of adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy), but
accepting the risk of increasing the number of patients
with false-positive results (who would incur the added
costs and possible adverse effects of trastuzumab).
The objective of this analysis was to estimate the
potential cost-effectiveness of expanded reflex testing for
3114

HER2 status among patients with early stage breast cancer. We assessed whether substantially reducing falsenegative results is a rational choice for both cost and effectiveness reasons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model Overview

This economic evaluation was a cost-utility assessment
that compared the costs and outcomes of 2 HER2 testing
algorithms from a US payer perspective: expanded reflex
testing and the standard testing algorithm. Expanded
reflex testing was defined as retesting IHC0, IHC11, or
FISH-negative early stage breast cancer tumors for HER2
status, while standard HER2 testing involved retesting
only IHC21 specimens using FISH in line with NCCN
guidelines.
The cost-effectiveness analysis utilized a decisionanalytic model. In the standard testing algorithm, tumor
specimens from patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer
would be tested for HER2 status using either FISH or
IHC. Patients whose tumors were initially tested using
FISH and were found to be positive received treatment
with trastuzumab, while patients with tumors found to be
FISH-negative did not receive further testing and were
not treated with trastuzumab.
In the expanded reflex testing arm, tumor specimens
of patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer were also
tested for HER2 status using either FISH or IHC.
Patients whose tumors were first tested using FISH and
found to be FISH-positive were treated with trastuzumab.
However, patients whose tumors were FISH-negative
received a second test (IHC) to ascertain HER2 overexpression. Patients in this group whose tumors were
IHC31 were treated with trastuzumab, while patients
whose tumors were negative or equivocal by the IHC test
(IHC0, IHC11, IHC21) were not treated with trastuzumab. Patients whose tumors were initially tested with
IHC and found to be IHC31 were treated with trastuzumab, while patients with IHC0, IHC11, and IHC21
results received a second test and were tested with FISH.
Of these patients, those whose tumors were found to be
FISH-positive were treated with trastuzumab.
Probabilities

Table 1 shows a summary of the parameters used in the
decision-analytic model. In the base case, it was assumed
that 80% of patient tumors are initially IHC-tested, and
20% FISH-tested.9 The probability of FISH positivity
at initial testing was 0.207 while the distribution of IHC
test results at initial testing was 36.1% IHC0, 35.5%

IHC11, 12.0% IHC21, and 16.2% IHC 31.15 The
probability of testing FISH-positive after initial IHC test
was 1.6% if previously IHC0, 4.9% if previously

following a negative FISH test were as follows: IHC0

that 95% of patients accept the recommendation to
receive trastuzumab.
Costs

Costs were expressed in 2010 US dollars. Costs from earlier years were converted into 2010 costs using the US
Consumer Price Index for health care. Costs were divided
into costs of HER2 testing with FISH or IHC, costs of

breast cancer treatment without trastuzumab, and costs of
trastuzumab. The cost of a FISH test was $339, while the
cost of an IHC test was $118.16 The lifetime cost of treatment without trastuzumab was $31,371,17 while the lifetime cost of trastuzumab was estimated based on 2010
Average Sales Price payment allowance limits for Medicare Part B at $57,677.18 Infusion costs are included as
well. Because we adopted a US payer perspective, we are
not considering indirect time or productivity costs (eg,
those associated with reduced labor force participation).
Life Years and Quality-Adjusted Life Years

Treatment with chemotherapy alone is associated with
11.88 life years (LYs) and 10.08 quality-adjusted life years
(QALYs), whereas treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab is associated with 13.72 LYs and 11.78
QALYs.17
Population Impact

Based on recent epidemiological data, we projected that
approximately 218,000 women with early stage breast
cancer would have their tumors tested for HER2 status in
2011.19 Given the test result probabilities, we estimated
the percentage and number of women who would have an
initial false-negative result.
Sensitivity Analysis

Robustness of results was assessed using sensitivity analysis. The percentage of patients whose tumors would be
reclassified as HER2-positive by reflex testing was varied
between 1% and 8% to determine the impact of this parameter on the cost-effectiveness of reflex testing. Parameter values were also varied across a range of plausible
values to determine the impact of variation on the overall
results. When data were available, the 95% confidence or
credibility ranges were used, and when unavailable, the
most plausible values were used. Univariate deterministic
sensitivity analysis was performed by assessing sensitivities
to individual parameters. To further test the robustness of
our results, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. Probability distributions for all parameters in the
model were created. The base-case value was used for the
mean, and the standard error was estimated based on the
approximation that the range used for 1-way sensitivity
analyses represented a 95% confidence interval, with the
range approximately equal to 4 times the standard error.20
A beta distribution was used for probabilities and utilities,
and a gamma distribution was used for costs. Monte Carlo
simulation was used to create 10,000 iterations for which
the expected outcome values were calculated. The

probability that expanded reflex testing was cost-effective
was then calculated for various levels of willingness to pay
per QALY gained. Data analysis was performed using
Microsoft Excel and TreeAge Pro.
RESULTS
Cost-Effectiveness

In the base case, retesting IHC0, IHC11, or FISHnegative tumors of patients with early stage breast cancer
for HER2 status (expanded reflex testing) is estimated to
increase the proportion of early breast cancer patients eligible to be treated with trastuzumab from 19.12% to
21.31%, an increment of 2.27% (Table 2). Expanded
reflex testing is estimated to cost an additional $1455 per
patient treated with an expected gain of 0.040 LYs and
0.037 QALYs (Table 2). Consequently, the incremental
cost per LY gained is $36,721 and the incremental cost
per QALY gained is $39,745.
Population Impact

Using the base case test result probabilities, we estimated
that 2.27% of women would have a false-negative result
in 2011. This would affect approximately 4700 women
annually in the United States.
Sensitivity Analysis

Varying the incremental proportion of women who were
included in the trastuzumab treatment pool from 1% to
8% resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER) ranging from $47,110 per QALY to $35,579 per
3116

QALY (Figure 3), and the extra number of women treated
annually in the United States varied from 2180 to 17,440.
One-way sensitivity analysis of key parameters is
illustrated as a tornado diagram (Figure 4). The ICER ($/
QALY) was most sensitive to the probability that the
reflex IHC test was IHC0 or IHC11 if the index FISH
test was negative and the utility associated with chemotherapy with trastuzumab. The ICER ($/QALY) was
more robust to other probabilities, utility, life expectancy,
and costs.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Figure 5) showed
that at a conservative cost-effectiveness threshold of
$50,000 per QALY, the probability that expanded reflex
testing would be cost-effective is approximately 87%; at a
threshold of $100,000 per QALY, the cost-effectiveness
would be nearly certain.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the projected potential lifetime cost per
QALY for implementing expanded reflex testing was estimated to be $39,745, a level that is below commonly
accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness for health care
interventions.21,22 This projected benefit is driven by the
additional yield of patients who are eligible for trastuzumab therapy—a 2.27% increase in the proportion of invasive breast cancer patients receiving this treatment. This
increase amounts to 4700 additional women in the
United States who would receive trastuzumab therapy
annually in the base case. Over their lifetimes, they would

be projected to gain an additional 9016 life years and
8330 QALYs (both discounted to a present value basis).
This magnitude of this benefit is uncertain and could
range from 2000 to 17,000 women within the plausible
range. Nonetheless, the benefits are substantial and imply
that the potential additional yield that results in reducing
false-negative cases at the expense of increasing falsepositive cases is cost-effective and may justify a change in
clinical policy.
A recent retesting study performed in the VIRGO
observational cohort, which included a substudy of 499
patients whose tumors were HER2-negative when locally
tested, showed that 22 (4%) patients were found to be
HER2-positive according to central laboratory testing.
Importantly, of these 22 patients, 15 (68%) were found to
be positive using a test that was not performed locally.
This finding suggests that the 2.27% base case projection
is likely to be conservative.23-25 At that false-negative
probability, the lifetime cost per QALY would improve,
falling by 7% to about $37,000.
3118

Our analysis implicitly assumes that all of the additional patients identified by reflex testing would accrue
the additional benefit due to trastuzumab: that is, they
would have the same biological response to treatment as
patients identified in the definitive trials, who were identified by the current testing algorithm. This assumption is
supported by data from the adjuvant N9831 trial6 and the
HERA trial.26
The other assumption implicit in our modeling
framework is that there is no differential uptake or acceptance of trastuzumab treatment between women identified by the current testing algorithm and the extra women
identified as a result of expanded reflex testing. This
assumption is plausible because the implementation of
reflex testing is likely to be a decision that is moved from
the patient to the physicians. The pathologist would most
likely be the decision maker and would simply perform
any revised testing protocol: they would test each negative
sample with the opposite test, and they would recommend
trastuzumab to patients testing positive, regardless of

Misclassification of HER2 results can arise due to
quality of laboratory testing and from the test itself. Misclassification due to quality of laboratory testing may be
Cancer

September 1, 2013

remedied by standardizing laboratory test procedures or
repeating tests with independent pathologists. However,
misclassification due to the test itself requires the development of a perfect test, which may not be feasible. Such a
test might also be prohibitively costly. Although a few
3119

Original Article

authors have suggested that FISH is superior to IHC in
reproducibility and precision,7 recent data contradict this
assumption: other data also suggest that both tests are similar in terms of reproducibility.23 Because both IHC and
FISH retain a level of subjectivity in their interpretation,
reflex testing might offer a cost-effective compromise
between allowing women with potential false-negative tumor results miss out on the benefits of trastuzumab and
perfect sensitivity and specificity in which there are no
false-positive or false-negative results. Another source of
potential misclassification of HER2 results may arise due
to intratumoral heterogeneity, and one might consider
retesting excision specimens for HER2 status even if
tumors tested HER2-negative at the initial biopsy.
The “believe the positive” approach, the argument
behind expanded reflex testing, implies that patients who
are incorrectly diagnosed as being HER2-positive in the
face of imperfect tests are treated with trastuzumab, and
data suggest that they benefit from this treatment. This is
a testament to the difficulty of defining false-positivity for
FISH and IHC in this early breast cancer context given
that they are based on subjective interpretation of pathological samples and that a true gold standard may not
exist. In theory, patients incorrectly diagnosed as being
HER2-positive would receive trastuzumab inadvertently
and would face both an unnecessary incremental cost (of
medication and adverse events) and the disutility of
adverse events. We find no evidence that this is the case,
and it has been suggested that misclassification leading to
missed HER2 cases has worse consequences than misclassification leading to HER2-negative cases getting treatment with trastuzumab27 because of recent advances in
reducing trastuzumab-related level 3 and 4
cardiotoxicity.28
We found no economic evaluations of expanded
reflex testing in the literature. Other economic evaluations
of HER2 testing have attempted to identify the most costeffective combination of FISH and IHC to minimize
both false-positive and false-negative results. Dendukuri
et al15 compared the cost-effectiveness of the following
strategies for identification of early stage breast cancer
patients for treatment with trastuzumab in Ontario: 1)
IHC followed by FISH for IHC21 patients; 2) IHC only
with IHC21 and 31 receiving trastuzumab; 3) IHC only
with IHC31 receiving trastuzumab; 4) IHC followed by
confirmation of IHC11 and IHC21 by FISH; 5) IHC
followed by confirmation of IHC21 and IHC31 by
FISH; 6) IHC followed by confirmation of IHC11,
IHC21, and IHC31 by FISH; and 7) FISH only. Each
was compared with strategy 1 (IHC followed by FISH for
3120

IHC21 patients) in terms of incremental cost per accurate diagnosis. The investigators found that confirmation
of HER2 status by FISH in IHC31 patients was optimal,
reducing the false-positive results to 0% and increasing
the percentage accurately determined to 97.6% at an
ICER of $6175 per case of HER2 status accurately determined. This study differs from our study because
expanded reflex testing does not seek to maximize accuracy but to maximize yield of HER2 cases (ie, minimize
false-negative results). This is the reason that our modeling framework allows for the treatment of patient with
initially false-positive results. Additionally, their study
considered only testing costs and disregarded costs of
treatment, measuring cost per accurate test as their outcomes compare to our study, which used cost per QALY.
Blank et al.29 used a life-long Markov model to
assess the cost-effectiveness of HER-2 tumor testing strategies comparing IHC, FISH, the combination of the two,
or FISH confirmation of IHC2 in the Swiss healthcare
system. They found that FISH alone is the most costeffective at e12,245 per QALY. Their optimal strategy
would also differ from expanded reflex testing because
with up to 5%-8% false-negative tests (ie, tumors that are
FISH-negative and IHC-positive) patients would not
receive trastuzumab if FISH alone is used.6 The advantage
of expanded reflex testing is that it further reduces the
chance of false-negative results, albeit at the cost of treating some false-positive results with trastuzumab.
One limitation of this analysis is that in taking the
US payer perspective, we do not consider indirect time or
productivity costs. In our previous analysis of trastuzumab
in adjuvant therapy, we estimated that the time and travel
costs associated with trastuzumab would be about $2000
over a lifetime, raising lifetime costs and the costeffectiveness ratio only slightly (by 4.6%) to about
$28,000 per QALY. This would still be considered costeffective, but it also ignores any indirect benefits in terms
of improved productivity or labor force attachment over
the remainder of the patient’s working life, which could
be very substantial.
Several factors will affect the potential implementation of expanded reflex testing. In practice, many laboratories only have the capacity to perform IHC, given the
additional equipment and expertise requirements for
implementing FISH. Implementing expanded reflex testing will require improvements in capacity and investment
in equipment, which may be costly. However, this would
be less expensive than implementing FISH as the index
test for HER2 status, as has been suggested, because the
percentage of patients receiving the FISH test rises from
Cancer

September 1, 2013

HER2 Pathology Round Robin/Garrison et al

26.6% under the current testing algorithm to 86.9%
under expanded reflex testing (compared with 100% if
FISH were the index test). This would require increased
capacity and reimbursement for extra tests. Furthermore,
there remains uncertainty about whether particular payers
will be willing to accept these changes. The US Food and
Drug Administration has approved additional HER2
tests, such as silver in situ hybridization, chromogenic in
situ hybridization (CISH), and dual in situ hybridization.
These new tests may reduce analytic burden (eg, CISH
requires widely available light microscopes instead of expensive fluorescent microscopes), thereby potentially
reducing the costs of expanded reflex testing.
In addition to identifying patients for treatment
with trastuzumab, HER2 testing is already being used to
identify patients for treatment with the tyrosine kinase
small molecule inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb; GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, PA), which has been approved
recently in adjuvant and neoadjuvant metastatic disease
settings. The emergence of newer therapies for adjuvant
and metastatic treatment of breast cancer that target
HER2 may impact the potential clinical utility and costeffectiveness of expanded reflex testing, particularly if
these drugs lead to additional gains in survival or QALYs,
implying that the potential impact of false-negative results
on patients is further amplified in LY or QALY terms.
Conclusion

HER2 testing is a cornerstone of treatment of patients
with breast cancer. While accuracy in testing is important,
a balance between having false-negative HER2 results and
treating false-positive patients with trastuzumab is an important clinical and policy decision. Expanded reflex testing is projected to be cost-effective at $39,745 per QALY
gained, and would affect approximately 4700 women
annually in the United States. The estimated benefit
would be even greater in younger patients. This base case
projects a false-negative probability of 2.27%, but this
may be a conservative figure given recent empirical evidence. Expanded reflex testing allows for a second opportunity to measure HER2 status accurately, correcting
both handling errors and testing inconsistency.
