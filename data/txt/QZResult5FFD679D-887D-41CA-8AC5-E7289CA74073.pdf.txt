Abstract
Intranodal immunization with antigen-encoding naked RNA may offer a simple and safe approach to induce
antitumor immunity. RNA taken up by nodal dendritic cells (DC) coactivates toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
that will prime and expand antigen-specific T cells. In this study, we show that RNA vaccination can be
optimized by coadministration of the DC-activating Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) ligand as an effective
adjuvant. Systemic administration of FLT3 ligand prior to immunization enhanced priming and expansion of
antigen-specific CD8þ T cells in lymphoid organs, T-cell homing into melanoma tumors, and therapeutic activity
of the intranodal RNA. Unexpectedly, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) were found to be essential for the adjuvant effect
of FLT3 ligand and they were systemically expanded together with conventional DCs after treatment. In
response to FLT3 ligand, pDCs maintained an immature phenotype, internalized RNA, and presented the RNAencoded antigen for efficient induction of antigen-specific CD8þ T-cell responses. Coadministration of FLT3
ligand with RNA vaccination achieved remarkable cure rates and survival of mice with advanced melanoma. Our
findings show how to improve the simple and safe strategy offered by RNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy.

Introduction
Direct application of naked antigen-encoding RNA is for
more than one decade under active investigation as a vaccine
approach against cancer (1). Compared with DNA, RNA
immunization lacks the risk of integration into the genome
and due to transient expression of the encoded antigens
allows better control of immune responses. In contrast to
viral recombinant vectors, RNA does not feature immunodominant viral antigens that interfere with the preferred antigenspecific immune response. Moreover, RNA-based compounds
not only deliver the complete antigen but also have an
intrinsic adjuvant activity. Recombinant RNA is easy to produce by in vitro transcription in large amounts and high purity.
The capability of RNA vaccines to confer antitumor immunity
has been shown in model systems (2–6) and promising results
of early clinical testing have been reported recently (7–9).

A few years ago, we developed a strategy to generate
pharmacologically optimized RNA with improved stability,
translational performance, and presentation of the encoded
antigen on MHC class I and II molecules (4, 10, 11). Injection of
such optimized RNA into lymph nodes is superior to any other
application route with regard to induction of potent antigenspecific T-cell immunity (5). The RNA propagates a proinflammatory microenvironment in the lymph node, resulting in
de novo priming and efficient expansion of antigen-specific
CD8þ and CD4þ T cells (5). By immunizing tumor-bearing
mice with this RNA vaccine, we achieved potent antitumor
immunity and remarkable survival benefit (5).
The objective of the current study was to further augment
the potency of intranodally administered RNA by combination
with a suitable adjuvant. Adjuvants are compounds that
enhance the magnitude, breadth, quality, and longevity of
specific immune responses to antigens and have minimal
toxicity. For a long time, adjuvant research progressed at a
slow pace and adjuvant design was largely empirical. In the
meantime, as the development of immunotherapeutics is
gaining speed, the need for rational selection strategies for
adjuvant formulations based on sound immunologic principles is becoming evident.
We recently revealed that RNA administered into the lymph
node is selectively internalized by resident immature dendritic
cells (DC) and that the uptake is highly efficient and is driven
by macropinocytosis (12). Both the cell type and the uptake
mechanism were shown to be functionally relevant for the
observed efficiency of intranodal RNA vaccination. These
notions were factored into the rationally guided search for
suitable adjuvants. With DCs being essential for vaccine

FLT3 Ligand Enhances Therapeutic Potency of RNA Vaccine

effects of intranodal RNA, we came across Fms-like tyrosine
kinase 3 (FLT3) ligand (13, 14), a naturally occurring glycoprotein stimulating early hematopoietic progenitors via the
FLT3 receptor (15) and mobilizing them from the bone
marrow into the peripheral blood and secondary lymphatic
organs. FLT3 ligand is known to induce profound expansion of
DCs in the peripheral lymphoid organs (16–18), and FLT3
ligand–induced DCs have an immature phenotype (19, 20).
However, it is not clear whether these DCs are capable of
presenting antigens encoded by RNA. In addition to expansion
of DCs, various other effects of FLT3 ligand have been
reported, including stimulation of natural killer (NK), B,
and T cells (21–24). These effects translated in improved Tcell immunity and antitumor potency in mouse models when
FLT3 ligand was used as an adjuvant in vaccination
approaches (16–18, 25–27).
In this study, we detail our efforts to evaluate FLT3 ligand in
combination with intranodally administered RNA and to
dissect the mechanisms underlying the strong synergy of both
compounds. Surprisingly, we revealed that plasmacytoid DCs
(pDC) are central to the observed adjuvant effects of FLT3
ligand. Our findings not only open new paths for improved
RNA vaccination strategies but also give unexpected insights
into the functional potency of pDCs.

Materials and Methods
Animals
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories.
TCR transgenic OT-I mice that recognize the H2-Kb-restricted SIINFEKL epitope (OVA257-264) from chicken ovalbumin
and C57BL/6-based IFN-a receptor (IFNAR)-deficient
(IFNAR/) mice (28) were kindly provided by H.J. Schild
(Mainz, Germany) and Paul-Ehrlich Institute (Langen,
Germany), respectively. All mice were kept in accordance
with federal and state policies on animal research at the
University of Mainz.
Cells
B16-F10 melanoma cell line expressing the chicken ovalbumin (OVA) gene (B16-OVA, a gift of U. Hartwig, University of
Mainz, Germany) was received in 2008 and subjected to
master cell bank generation. Early (third and fourth) passages
of cells were used for tumor experiments. Cells were routinely
tested for Mycoplasma. Reauthentification of cells has not
been done since receipt. FLT3 ligand-conditioned bone marrow–derived DCs (FLT3L-BMDC) were generated by 8-day
culture of bone marrow precursors with 200 ng/mL FLT3LIgG4.
FLT3 ligand plasmid construction and protein
purification
A cDNA representing the signal peptide and extracellular
domain of human FLT3 ligand (aa 1–185) was cloned into an
expression vector and carboxy-terminally fused to a 675-bp
fragment coding for the hinge region and heavy chain constant regions 2 and 3 [(CH2 and CH3) of human IgG4], to
obtain FLT3L-IgG4. As control, the 675-bp IgG4-Fc fragment

www.aacrjournals.org

(IgG4) was cloned separately in the expression vector. HEK293
cells were transfected with these constructs using polyetylenimine (PEI; Sigma-Aldrich) for production of FLT3L-IgG4 or
IgG4 proteins, which subsequently were purified from culture
supernatants by affinity chromatography with Mab-Select
SuRe columns (GE Healthcare) and stored at 80 C. FLT3LIgG4 or IgG4 fragments were administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.). In some experiments, human IgG4 kappa antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a control.
RNA vaccines, in vitro transcription, and intranodal
immunization
All plasmids for in vitro transcription of naked antigenencoding RNA encoding luciferase (Luc) are based on the
pST1-2hBgUTR-A120 backbone (10), which feature a 30 human
b-globin untranslated region (hBgUTR) and a poly(A) tail of
120 nucleotides and allow generation of pharmacologically
improved in vitro transcribed RNA. The MITD vectors pST1sec-SIINFEKL-MITD-2hBgUTR-A120 (SIINFEKL; ref. 11) and
pST1-sec-Influenza-HA-MITD-2hBgUTR-A120 (HA; ref. 11) allow tagging of the respective protein with a secretion signal
(Sec) and the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the
MHC class I (MITD) ensuring efficient presentation on MHC
class I and class II. The SIINFEKL construct contains aa 257 to
264 of chicken OVA and the HA construct a codon-optimized
partial sequence of influenza HA (aa 60–285 fused to aa 517–
527; influenza strain A/PR/8/34) designed to combine major
immunodominant MHC epitopes.
In vitro transcription and purification of RNA were previously described (29). HA-RNA was labeled with Cy5-UTP (Cy5RNA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). Purified RNA was assessed by spectrophotometry, gel
electrophoresis, and BioAnalyzer (Agilent).
As described previously (5), for intranodal immunization of
mice with naked RNA, the inguinal lymph node of anaesthetized mice was surgically exposed, 20 mg RNA in 10 mL RNasefree PBS (Ambion) were injected intranodally, and the wound
was closed.
Flow cytometry and tetramer staining
All monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were from BD Pharmingen, except anti-PDCA1 (Miltenyi Biotec). Hypotonically lysed
blood and splenocyte samples were incubated at 4 C with
mAbs. Lymph node cells were obtained by digestion with
collagenase (1 mg/mL; Roche). Direct ex vivo quantification of
SIINFEKL-specific CD8þ cells with H-2 Kb/SIINFEKL tetramer
(Beckman-Coulter) without in vitro stimulation (10) and intracellular cytokine staining (29) were previously described.
Absolute quantification of NK cells in blood was carried out
with Trucount tubes (BD Biosciences) by adding 50 mL
heparinized blood to the Trucount tube, staining with antibodies against CD45, CD3, and NK1.1, and quantification of
cells after lysis of erythrocytes with fluorescence-activated
cell-sorting (FACS) lysing solution (BD Biosciences). Regulatory T cells (Treg) were analyzed with the FoxP3 Staining Kit
(eBioscience). Conventional DCs (cDC; (CD11cþPDCA1) and
pDCs (CD11cþPDCA1þ) were sorted by FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Quantification of H-2 Kb/SIINFEKL complexes by

25-D1.16 antibody was carried out as previously described
(10). Flow cytometric data were acquired on a FACSCalibur
and FACSCanto analytic flow cytometers (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star) software.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Uptake and translation of Luc-RNA were evaluated by
in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using the IVIS Lumina
imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences; ref. 4). Briefly, an
aqueous solution of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg body weight; BD
Biosciences) was injected intraperitoneally 24 hours after
administration of Luc-RNA. After 15 minutes, emitted photons
were quantified (integration time of 1 minute). In vivo bioluminescence in regions of interest (ROI) were quantified as
total flux (photons per seconds) using IVIS Living Image 3.0
Software.
Quantitative real time PCR
Extraction of total cellular RNA, first-strand cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays (Applied Biosystems), and normalization to the housekeeping gene Hprt1 were described previously (30).
Tumor experiments
Tumor vaccination protocols were previously described (5).
Briefly, 2  105 B16-OVA melanoma cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into the flanks of C57BL/6 mice. FLT3L-IgG4
(10 mg) or human IgG4 control antibody were administered
intraperitoneally on day 3, day 7, day 14, and day 18 after
tumor inoculation. Four intranodal immunizations of SIINFEKL-RNA (20 mg) in 3- to 4-day intervals were initiated
11 days after tumor cell inoculation (diameter of tumors 2
mm). The tumor sizes were measured every 3 days. Mice were
sacrificed when tumor diameter reached 15 mm.
Tumor-infiltrating cells (TIC) were obtained by mechanical
disruption of the tumor tissue and phenotyping: myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC; CD11bþ, Gr1þ), Tregs
(CD4þ, CD25þFoxP3þ), NK cells (NK1.1þ, CD3), B cells
(CD19þ, CD3), SIINFEKLþ CD8þ T cells (CD3þ, CD8þ,
tetramerþ), CD8þ T cells (CD3þ, CD8þ, CD4), CD4þ T cells
(CD3þ, CD4þCD8), pDC (CD11cþ, PDCA1þ, NK1.1), and
cDC (CD11cþ, PDCA1, NK1.1).
In vivo depletion of pDCs
C57BL/6 mice received 500 mg of anti-PDCA1 (Miltenyi
Biotec) mAb or a monoclonal rat IgG1 mAb (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as a control 2 times in 6-day intervals.
Enzyme-linked immunospot assay
Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was carried
out as described before (5). Briefly, 1  104 cDCs or pDCs
sorted from SIINFEKL-RNA or control RNA (HA-RNA) electroporated FLT3L-BMDCs were coincubated with 1  105
magnetic-associated cell-sorted CD8þ OT-I T cells in a microtiter plate coated with anti-IFN-g antibody (10 mg/mL,
clone AN18; Mabtech). After 18 hours at 37 C, cytokine
secretion was detected with an anti-IFN-g antibody (clone
R4-6A2; Mabtech).

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Cryosections (4–6 mm) from mouse lymph nodes were fixed
with cold acetone and blocked with PBS-containing 5% mouse
serum.
For indirect staining, rat-anti-PDCA1 (JF05-1C2.4.1; Miltenyi), rat-anti-F4/80 (BM8; eBioscience) or rat-anti-NK1.1
(PK136; BD Biosciences) as primary antibodies were combined with Cy3-anti-rat-IgG (N418; Molecular Probes). For
direct staining, reticular fibroblasts and fibers were visualized
with Alexa488-anti-ER-TR7 (BMA), sections were mounted in
Vectashield mounting medium (VECTORLabs), analyzed with
a Zeiss immunofluorecence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH), and digital images were prepared using
Photoshop CS4 (Adobe).
Statistics
GraphPad Prism software using unpaired 2-tailed Student's
t test or ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test was
used. Differences in survival were analyzed by the log-rank
test. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
FLT3 ligand treatment expands DCs and NK cells in the
lymph node and spleen
In an attempt to test compounds expanding the DC
population in combination with intranodal RNA, we came
across FLT3 ligand. As the half-life of FLT3 ligand in serum
is very short (31), we engineered a recombinant fusion
protein (Fig. 1A) linking the extracellular domain of human
FLT3 ligand to the heavy chain constant regions 2 and 3
(CH2-CH3 domain) of human IgG4 to increase the serum
half-life (data not shown). It was already shown that human
FLT3 ligand can cross-react with mouse FLT3 (32),
which enabled the use of human FLT3 ligand in the murine
setting. Two intraperitoneal applications of this FLT3
ligand IgG4 fusion protein (referred to as FLT3L-IgG4)
resulted in significant increase of cellularity in lymph
nodes and spleen as compared with controls [PBS or the
IgG4-Fc protein fragment lacking the FLT3 ligand moiety
(referred to as IgG4; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A)]. As
DCs resident in lymphoid organs are of major relevance for
the mechanism of action of intranodally administered RNA,
we analyzed these cells in more detail. Subpopulations of
cDCs and pDCs were profoundly expanded in both compartments of FLT3 ligand–treated mice as compared with
controls (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1B). As revealed in
lymph node sections, pDCs accumulated in the T-cell zones
(Fig. 1D). Noteworthy, neither lymph node cDCs nor pDCs
of FLT3 ligand–treated mice showed molecular signs of
maturation (Fig. 1E).
As described recently (22, 33), CD3NK1.1þ NK cells
were significantly expanded in lymph nodes and spleen
of mice treated with FLT3 ligand (Fig. 1D and F) and were
most prominent around day 7 in blood (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In line with reports on FLT3 ligand application in
rats (34), we found no expansion of macrophages in mice
(Fig. 1D).

FLT3 ligand and intranodal RNA vaccination synergize
in inducing a Th1 lymph node milieu and in activation
of DCs and NK cells
Next, we investigated the fate and effects of intranodally
injected RNA when combined with FLT3 ligand as adjuvant.
We found that Cy5-labeled HA-RNA injected into lymph nodes
of mice preconditioned with 2 treatment cycles of FLT3 ligand
was internalized by both pDCs and cDCs with high efficiency
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, as shown by in vivo BLI, translation of LucRNA injected into lymph nodes of these mice was comparable
with that of control mice (Fig. 2B).

Most interestingly, when FLT3 ligand–treated mice received RNA intranodally, maturation of pDCs was induced as
documented by increase of markers CD80, CD86, CD40, and
MHC II (Fig. 2C). This is in analogy to what we recently
reported for cDCs consecutively to intranodal RNA administration (5). DCs started secretion of high levels of interleukin (IL)-12 (Fig. 2D, left). Most interestingly, pDCs were
preferentially expanded and activated by RNA so that their
absolute number per lymph node surpassed that of cDCs
(Fig. 2D, right). Expression profiling of pDCs and cDCs from
lymph nodes by quantitative RT-PCR revealed profound

FLT3 Ligand Enhances Therapeutic Potency of RNA Vaccine

alteration of the lymph node microenvironment of mice
receiving the combination of FLT3 ligand and RNA as
compared with mice receiving FLT3 ligand alone (Fig. 2E).
NK cells and Th1 lymphocytes attracting chemokines
CXCL10 (IP10) and CXCL9 (35, 36) were induced up to 2
logs. IL-6, which supports expansion and survival of primed
T cells (37) and CD40 receptor, a key mediator of DC
activation by CD4þ T cells, were upregulated, the latter
particularly in pDCs. DC recruiting chemokines CCL3
(MIP-1a) and CCL4 (38) were modestly elevated, whereas
IFN-a expression did not change.
Intranodal administration of naked RNA to FLT3 ligand–
treated mice also had a major impact on NK cells. The
frequency and absolute number of lymph node NK cells
(Fig. 2F) as well as their intracellular IFN-g levels (Supplementary Fig. S3A) increased significantly and they exhibited
an activated CD69þ phenotype (Fig. 2G). Moreover, absolute
number and frequency of lymph node NK cells secreting high
amounts of IFN-g, when treated with PMA in vitro, were clearly
higher in RNA treated group (Supplementary Fig. S3B), showing enhanced susceptibility of NK cells for inflammatory
stimuli.
These findings underline that the combination of FLT3
ligand and intranodal RNA administration induces an inflammatory Th1 milieu, favorable for the efficient priming and
expansion of antigen-specific T cells, and leads to functional
activation of both antigen presenters as well as NK cells, thus
integrating all factors required for an efficient immune
response.
pDCs are essential for augmentation of RNA-induced
antigen-specific T-cell response by FLT3 ligand
preconditioning
We then characterized T-cell responses induced by
combining FLT3 ligand with intranodal RNA vaccination.
Mice received FLT3 ligand at day 0 and day 3 followed by
intranodal SIINFEKL-RNA immunization at day 7 and day
10. Frequencies of SIINFEKL-specific CD8 þ T cells measured 5 days after the last immunization were profoundly
increased in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of FLT3
ligand preconditioned mice (Fig. 3A), and these cells
secreted IFN-g upon antigen encounter (Supplementary
Fig. S4). To determine the relevance of pDCs for the
observed adjuvant effect, pDC-depleting antibody anti-

PDCA1 was administered to mice preconditioned with
FLT3 ligand prior to immunization with SIINFEKL-RNA,
resulting in reduction of the pDC subpopulation in the
lymph node to half of normal levels and nearly complete
abrogation in the spleen (Fig. 3B), whereas cDC and NK
cell numbers were not altered (data not shown). Frequencies of SIINFEKL-specific CD8 þ T cells achieved by the
combination of FLT3 ligand and intranodal SIINFEKLRNA administration were significantly lower in pDC-depleted mice than in mice with normal pDC frequencies
(Fig. 3C). pDC-depleted mice treated with FLT3 ligand
and SIINFEKL-RNA had T-cell frequencies comparable
with those of mice that were immunized with SIINFEKL-RNA alone, suggesting that the increment in T-cell
response achieved by FLT3 ligand preconditioning is
significantly mediated by pDCs.
To elucidate the mechanism by which pDCs mediate the
FLT3 ligand adjuvant effect, we first tested their capability to
act as antigen presenters. BMDCs were differentiated in vitro
in FLT3 ligand–supplemented medium that resulted in a
mixed population of cDCs and pDCs (FLT3L-BMDCs).
FLT3L-BMDCs were transfected with SIINFEKL- or control-RNA, and SIINFEKL peptide/MHC molecule complexes
were quantified with the 25-D1.16 antibody (Fig. 3D). Most
interestingly, we found efficient processing and presentation
of the peptide by pDCs (factor 3.0 vs. 3.7 as compared with
cDCs). When these peptide-presenting cDCs and pDCs were
sorted and tested in ELISPOT for recognition by TCR transgenic OT-I CD8þ T cells (Fig. 3E), pDCs strongly induced
IFN-g secretion, indicating their capability to act as efficient
antigen-presenting cells.
To investigate whether IFN-a secretion, one of the most
prominent constitutive functions of pDCs, plays a role in the
adjuvant effect of FLT3 ligand, we treated IFNAR/ mice
with FLT3 ligand or PBS as control followed by vaccination
with SIINFEKL-RNA. The increased frequency of SIINFEKLspecific CD8þ T cells in FLT3 ligand–treated mice compared
with control mice showed that IFN-a secretion is not key for
the FLT3 ligand adjuvant effect (Fig 3F).
FLT3 ligand improves antitumoral therapeutic
immunity mediated by intranodal RNA vaccination
Next, we wanted to know whether the profound therapeutic benefit of intranodal RNA immunization in animal

C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 3–12) were treated with 2 cycles of Flt3L-IgG4 (10 mg i.p., day 0 and day 3) followed by intranodal vaccination with RNA (20 mg;
day 7; HA-RNA, if not indicated otherwise) or control (in vitro transcription reaction mixture lacking RNA polymerase) in several independent experiments. If not
indicated otherwise, analysis was done 24 hours after RNA injection. A, HA-RNA administered intranodally to Flt3L-IgG4–treated C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 4)
was Cy5-labeled (Cy5-nucleotides as control). One hour after RNA injection, uptake in DCs was quantified. B, Luc-RNA (20 mg) was injected into lymph nodes
of C57BL/6 mice (n ¼ 8), and BLI was carried out 24 hours later (left; red lines, mean values). A representative image is shown (right). C, maturation

(CD11cþPDCA1þ) and cDC (CD11cþPDCA1) in injected lymph nodes were quantified by intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro culture for 6 hours in the
presence of brefeldin A (BFA) to allow intracellular cytokine accumulation before staining. Representative dot plots (left) show gating strategy and

models can be topped by the addition of FLT3 ligand. For an
advanced B16-OVA melanoma model, tumor cells were
inoculated (day 0) and mice were conditioned with 4 administrations of FLT3 ligand. Tumors were grown to macroscopic visibility, and 4 cycles of SIINFEKL-RNA vaccination
were initiated 11 days after tumor inoculation (Fig. 4A). As
single agents, intranodal RNA immunization cured only 30%
of mice and FLT3 ligand alone had a very moderate effect on
survival. By combining the RNA vaccine and FLT3 ligand,
however, 70% of the treated mice were cured from their
cancer and survived or became tumor-free. When we characterized the TICs in the treatment groups, we found
significant differences. Although FLT3 ligand as single agent
did not alter the composition of immune cell infiltrations in
the tumor nodule, intranodal administration of SIINFEKLRNA alone expanded nearly all tested subpopulations, in
particular of pDCs, cDCs, NK cells, T cells, MDSCs, and Tregs
(Fig. 4B). The combination of both agents had a minor
incremental effect on cellularity as compared with RNA
alone. Interestingly, the percentage of antigen-specific
CD8þ T cells was profoundly increased (Fig. 4B). As a
consequence, in animals treated with the combination,
Tregs were outnumbered by cytotoxic antigen-specific
CD8þ effector T cells (Fig. 4C).
In summary, these data imply that FLT3 ligand preconditioning further improves the survival benefit achieved by
intranodal vaccination with antigen-encoding RNA and that
this is associated with an increase of antigen-specific cytotoxic
T cells infiltrating the tumor lesion.

Discussion
The use of antigen-encoding RNA for cancer vaccination
confers several advantages. These can be fully exploited when
RNA is administered intranodally and unfolds its dual potential as a template for efficient translation as well as immunostimulatory ligand for Toll-like receptors (TLR).
This study was undertaken to evaluate FLT3 ligand as a
systemic adjuvant in conjunction with intranodal RNA vaccination. This report shows for the first time that FLT3
ligand potentiates immunogenicity of intranodal RNA vaccination. We reveal that several mechanisms contribute to
this synergy.
First, FLT3 ligand expands DC and NK populations in
different compartments including the lymph node and thus
mobilizes beforehand a higher number of antigen presenters
and effectors to the site the antigen will be delivered to. Our
findings verify our primary hypothesis that the number of
antigen presenters in the lymph node may be rate limiting
for efficacy of RNA vaccines and should be considered when
selecting candidate compounds to combine with RNA. Surprisingly, we found that within the DC population, pDCs
have the most dominant impact on the magnitude of induced immune responses and that in pDC-depleted mice
adjuvant effects of FLT3 ligand are abrogated. According to
our data, this can be attributed to the fact that in combination with antigen-encoding RNA, pDCs act as efficient

6138

Cancer Res; 71(19) October 1, 2011

antigen presenters, which is in analogy to effects of RNA on
cDCs (5). As we show for the first time, pDCs are able to
efficiently internalize RNA, are thereby activated to secrete
IL-12, and process as well as present the encoded antigen
with high efficiency.
Another mechanism is that FLT3 ligand not as single agent
but together with RNA activates both cell types to develop a
phenotype optimal for their cross-talk and further augments
the Th1-skewing effect of RNA resulting in a pronounced
proinflammatory lymph node microenvironment.
Moreover, in accordance with previous studies (19, 20), we
show that systemic FLT3 ligand administration does not lead
to DC maturation; hence, FLT3 ligand–expanded DCs retain
their immature phenotype, thereby enabling efficient internalization of vaccine RNA by immature DCs. Many adjuvants
mediate maturation of antigen-presenting cells and this effect
is associated with efficient induction of sustained immune
responses and therefore highly desired. It is already known
that macropinocytic activity of DCs is abolished by maturation stimuli (39, 40). Accordingly, we previously observed that
preincubation of DCs with maturation-inducing adjuvants
such as LPS, CD40L, or dsRNA abrogated the capability of
DCs to engulf RNA (12). The concomitant impairment of
macropinocytosis is less relevant for extracellularly stable
vaccine formats (e.g., protein or DNA-based vaccines). For
RNA vaccines, in contrast, which have a short extracellular
half-life, antigen salvage into DCs by macropinocytosis is a
critical requirement.
In summary, these mechanisms result in a significantly
higher frequency of antigen-specific T cells in the periphery
and in tumor lesions of B16 melanoma. Higher CD8/Treg
ratios within tumors are reached, which are known to be
indicative for effective vaccination and in fact result in a
compelling cure rate in mice suffering from advanced B16
melanoma (41, 42).
These observations imply that an adjuvant should be chosen on the basis of complementarity of its mode of action with
that of the vaccine format it will be combined with. The
superior immunopharmaceutical performance of RNA administered intranodally depends on its selective uptake via immature DCs and creation of a Th1-type microenvironment.
These prerequisites are easy to meet for FLT3 ligand, as it does
not counteract, but rather enhances these 2 advantageous
features.
Our data also convey a better understanding of adjuvant
features of FLT3 ligand. It is known that daily FLT3 ligand
injections alter cellular composition in blood and secondary
lymphatic organs of mice including induction of a marked DC
hyperplasia (16–18). In contrast to the reported regimens
based usually on administering 10 to 20 mg FLT3 ligand for
7 to 9 days (18, 43), we achieved even superior antitumoral
effects in vivo with only 2 injections of 10 mg (day 0 and day 3)
most likely owing to the high cooperative complementarity of
naked RNA and FLT3 ligand. Most interestingly, among
the different vaccine formats with which FLT3 ligand have
been combined in the past, DNA vaccines have yielded the
best results (27, 44, 45). Neither uptake mechanisms of DNA

vaccines nor the reason for synergizing with FLT3 ligand is
known, but it is well conceivable that our findings for RNA
may apply for nucleic acids in general.
Safety and tolerability of FLT3 ligand have been shown in
healthy human donors (46, 47) and cancer patients (48–51).
Two clinical trials in cancer patients combined peptide
vaccination with FLT3 ligand as adjuvant but failed to
augment antigen-specific T-cell immunity, which was attributed to the nonactivated state of FLT3 ligand–mobilized
DCs (50, 52). By addition of the TLR7 ligand imiquimod to a
peptide vaccine plus FLT3 ligand, the lack of peptide-specific
T-cell responses could be overcome in a melanoma trial (53).
Similar data have been obtained when DNA vaccines were
combined with FLT3 ligand (44). Future studies have to
show whether the property of RNA to trigger TLR signaling
pathways in conjunction with the adjuvant effect of FLT3
ligand may further improve vaccine potency in the clinical
setting as well.
In summary, these unexpected findings not only are of high
relevance for design of future RNA-based cancer vaccine
protocols but also contribute to a better conceptual understanding of adjuvant strategies.
