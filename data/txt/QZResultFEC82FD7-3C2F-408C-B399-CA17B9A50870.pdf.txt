ABSTRACT
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a membrane receptor
tyrosine kinase over-expressed in a number of tumors. However, combating
resistance is one of the main challenges in the currently available IGF-1R inhibitorbased cancer therapies. Increased Src activation has been reported to confer
resistance to anti-IGF-1R therapeutics in various tumor cells. An urgent unmet need
for IGF-1R inhibitors is to suppress Src rephosphorylation induced by current antiIGF-1R regimens. In efforts to develop effective anticancer agents targeting the
IGF-1R signaling pathway, we explored 2-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazin-5-ones as a novel
scaffold that is structurally unrelated to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
The compound, LL-2003, exhibited promising antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo;
it effectively suppressed IGF-1R and Src and induced apoptosis in various non-small
cell lung cancer cells. Further optimizations for enhanced potency in cellular assays
need to be followed, but our strategy to identify novel IGF-1R/Src inhibitors may
open a new avenue to develop more efficient anticancer agents.

thought to be related to the resistance to IGF-1R inhibitorbased anticancer therapies [17, 18]. Combating resistance
is one of the main challenges in the currently available
IGF-1R inhibitor-based cancer therapies [7]. Combined
treatment with IGF-1R and Src inhibitors could result in
toxicity problems. Therefore, an urgent unmet need for
developing dual inhibitors that target both IGF-1R and
Src remains.
Peptoids (oligomers of N-substituted glycines)
are a class of peptidomimetics known to interact
with various proteins [19–23]. Although they show
promise for therapeutic use [24–27], their flexibility
and limited hydrogen bonds compared to peptides have
limited  their  therapeutic applications [28–31]. 2-Aryl4H-1,3,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-ones, rigidified forms of
peptoids [23,  32–34], can be synthesized using solid
phase peptoid synthesis [35, 36]. Few biological effects
of these compounds are known other than monoamine
oxidase (MAO) inhibition and preliminary anticancer
activity [37, 38]. These molecules are chemically unrelated

INTRODUCTION
The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)
is a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in
oncogenic transformation and metastasis and is overexpressed in a number of tumors [1–5]. The IGF-1R
signaling pathway plays a critical role in the proliferation
and survival of various tumor types. The IGF-1R
signaling pathway is associated with resistance to many
chemotherapeutics, including chemotherapy, radiation,
and molecularly targeted therapies, which is of particular
importance [1, 6–9]. Therefore, effective regimens to
inactivate the IGF-1R pathway have been anticipated to
provide clinical benefits to cancer patients [6, 10–12].
Accordingly, the IGF-1R signaling pathway has been a
major target for the development of anticancer agents.
However, the therapeutic efficacy of IGF-1R inhibitors,
mainly monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI), has been modest in a variety of human
cancers [13–16]. In particular, increased Src activation is

to other current anticancer agents, showing potential as
a new chemotherapeutic scaffold. The chemical space
of current TKIs has been limited to only small number
of scaffolds, including substituted benzene, pyrimidine/
pyridine, piperazine/morpholine, or benzamide/phenyl
urea. Therefore, a large part of the chemical space is yet
to be explored [39–42]. To synthesize novel compounds
that can suppress both IGF-1R and Src, we explored new
chemical scaffolds, not related to current TKIs, by the
construction of libraries of peptoids along with molecular
docking studies.
Here, we demonstrate the preclinical evidence
of promising antitumor effects of LL-2003, a novel
oxadiazinone compound, in vitro and in vivo. LL-2003
effectively suppressed IGF-1R and Src and induced
apoptosis in various non-small cell lung cancer cells.
Although further optimizations for enhanced potency in
cellular assays need to be followed, the unique activities of
the novel oxadiazinone compound that we identified from
the peptidomimetic library may lead to new mechanistic
studies exploring signaling pathways associated with
cancer resistance and may overcome the limitations of
current mAbs or TKI inhibitors.

peptoid synthesis using MBHA resin. After initial Fmoc
deprotection, acylation with bromoacetic acid and
N,N’-diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF was followed
by nucleophilic displacement with benzohydrizide for
1 hour. For the last acylation step, bromochloroacetic
acid was used to incorporate the –Cl group. The
final  cyclization reaction was performed using excess
N,N-diisopropylethylamine to ensure complete cyclization
to afford oxadiazinone compounds.
Other studies of oxadiazinone synthesis have used
derivatization only at the N4 or C2 positions for MAO
inhibitor development [37]. However, the C6 position of
the oxadiazinone scaffold has rarely been functionalized.
Our docking analysis with OXA40 suggested that C6
could be functionalized to fit better in the binding site of
IGF-1R (Figure S1). When the chlorine atom was replaced
with a bulky aromatic group, the docked molecules
aligned well with increased docking scores (Table S1).
To expand the functionality of the oxadiazinone scaffold,
methyl, phenyl, and halogen groups were incorporated at
C6 of oxadiazinones as depicted in Figure 2B. Michael
addition followed by acylation with α-chlorophenylacetyl
chloride or 2-chloropropionyl chloride afforded
corresponding benzohydrazide intermediates, which were
then subsequently cyclized to generate 3a–3h and 4a–4f.
Compound OXA40 was obtained in low yield from the
solid phase synthesis, presumably due to acid-promoted
ring opening. We also established a new synthesis of
OXA40 in solution, where the vigorous cleavage step
associated with TFA can be avoided (Figure 2C).

RESULTS
Activation of Src in NSCLC cells after treatment
with an IGF-1R TKI
In our previous studies, inhibition of IGF-1R
signaling with a monoclonal antibody (cixutumumab)
induced Src reactivation as a bypassing mechanism via
binding of free IGF1 to integrin β3, resulting in resistance
to the drug [17]. In this study, we also observed that
treatment with linsitinib (OSI-906), an IGF-1R TKI, also
induced a time- and dose-independent Src activation
in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
lines, including A549, H226Br, and H1975. As shown
in Figure 1, IGF-1R phosphorylation was blocked
by treatment with linsitinib for up to 24 h. However, a
concomitant Src re-phosphorylation was observed,
indicating a reprogramming of the NSCLC cell lines in
response to the blockade of IGF-1R signaling by treatment
with an IGF-1R TKI.

LL-2003 (3c) displays antiproliferative activities
and suppresses IGF-1R and Src phosphorylation
in human non-small cell lung cancer cells
The effect of oxadiazinones 3a–3h and 4a–4f on the
viability of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells was
tested in H1299 cells by the MTT assay (Figure 3A). Among
the 14 oxadiazinone derivatives shown in Figure 2B, several
compounds displayed concentration-dependent inhibitory
effects on cell viability. In particular, LL-2003 (3c) and
3b at the concentration of 20 μM reduced cell viability by
~40 and 46%, respectively. The phenyl substitutions at the
C6 position of oxadiazinone resulted in enhanced potency
compared to methyl substituents. These C6-substituted
derivatives of oxadiazinones moderately inhibited the
viability of H1299 cells in a concentration-dependent
manner, with the IC50 values ranging from 22.4 to 64.6 μM
(Table 1). Based on this result, we chose LL-2003 (3c) as
a potential IGF-1R inhibitor and evaluated its anticancer
activities in various NSCLC cell lines.
We then assessed the effects of LL-2003 on the
phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Src. LL-2003 effectively
suppressed the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Src
(Figures 3B and S2). Total IGF-1R and Src expressions
remained unaffected by the treatment. In addition, the
phosphorylation of Akt, a converging downstream

Synthesis of C6-functionalized oxadiazinone
derivatives
In order to develop novel anticancer regimens to
inhibit the IGF-1R signaling without activating the Src
signaling pathway, we have begun an investigation into
the discovery of compounds that block IGF-1R activation
without a concomitant Src activation. Previous anticancer
activity screenings have led us to identify OXA40 as a hit
compound for IGF-1R inhibition from the oxadiazinone
peptoid (OXA) libraries (Figure 2A). This compound
with the –Cl group at C6 was obtained from solid phase

of IGF-1R and Src, was also suppressed by LL-2003
treatment. In addition, LL-2003 did not modulate the
mRNA expression of IGF-1R and Src at the same
experimental conditions (Figure S3). These results suggest
that LL-2003 effectively suppresses the phosphorylation
of both IGF-1R and Src without affecting total expression
levels in NSCLC cells lines. A recent finding showed
inactivation of Akt2 not by a Src inhibitor dasatinib but
by an IGF-1R inhibitor BMS-754807 [43], suggesting
that Akt2 could be activated by the IGF-1R pathway
in a Src-independent manner. Based on this notion, we
assessed the effect of LL-2003 on the phosphorylation
of Akt2. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed Akt2
phosphorylation was effectively regulated by treatment
with LL-2003 (Figure S4). This result suggests that LL2003 could suppress the IGF-1R signaling pathway through
Src-dependent and Src-independent mechanisms. The
inhibitory effects of LL-2003 (3c) and 3b on cell viability
were comparable to those of clinically available Src
(dasatinib) or IGF-1R (linsitinib) TKIs or greater than those
of a preclinical IGF-1R inhibitor (AG1024) (Figure 3C).

similarly suppressed by the drug treatment (Figure 4B).
To investigate the mechanisms by which LL-2003
suppressed the viability and colony formation abilities
of NSCLC cells, we examined whether LL-2003 has
the capacity to induce apoptosis. Poly-(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage was markedly increased
in H1299, H226B,  H226B/R, H460, and H460/R by
treatment with LL-2003 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figures  4C  and  S2). These findings suggest that the
capacity of a dual IGF-1R/Src inhibitor, LL-2003,  to
induce apoptosis. We assessed the effects of  LL-2003
on anchorage-independent colony formation of NSCLCs
using soft agar assay because tumorigenic cells can
grow in semisolid medium, especially in soft agar [44].
Treatment with LL-2003 displayed significantly inhibitory
effects on colony formation of various NSCLC cells
(Figure 4D). LL-2003 exhibited similar effects on cell
viability, the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Src, and
induction of PARP cleavage in MCF7 human breast
cancer cells, suggesting LL-2003 could be applicable to
other types of cancers (Figure S5). These findings indicate
in vitro evidence supporting the efficacy of dual IGF-1R/
Src inhibitor, LL-2003, in NSCLC cells.

Next, we examined the effects of LL-2003 on the
viability and colony forming abilities of various NSCLC
cell lines (i.e., A549, H1299, H226B, H226B/R, and
H460). The MTT assay revealed that LL-2003 significantly
inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 4A). LL-2003 displayed no
obvious effects on the viability of BEAS-2B normal
human bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 4A), suggesting
minimal toxicity of LL-2003 to normal cells. Anchoragedependent colony forming abilities of these cell lines were

with  vehicle (20 μL of DMSO and 480 μL of corn oil),
or LL-2003 (50 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal
injection. Treatment with LL-2003 for 17 d significantly
inhibited tumor growth compared to the control group,

of LL-2003 as an anticancer drug against NSCLC cells.

we focused on docking the molecules to the ATP binding
site. Re-docking of PQIP to the ATP binding site gave
a pose similar to the original X-ray structure (0.579 Å),
which validates the docking method. As a result, docking
scores increased when a phenyl group was added to the
oxadiazinone ring (Table S1).
As shown in Figure 6A, human Src (pdb: 1YOL)
and IGF-1R (PDB: 3D94) have high homology in their
overlaid structures. These two proteins share an overall
fold of 8 α-helices and 1 β-sheet with an overall RMSD
of 6.375  Å  (aligned based on the Cα atoms of each
residue),  despite only 39% homology in amino acid
sequence. LL-2003 aligned well within the ATP binding
pocket of Src [46]. The -Cl group is oriented toward
the surface, while the phenyl group fits deeply into the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hydrophobic pocket (Figure 6B and 6C) [47]. The C6 phenyl
substituent on the oxadiazinone ring fits into a hydrophobic
pocket comprised of Ala295, Ile338, and Thr340, resulting
in improved docking scores compared to OXA40 (Figure 6D
and Table S1). Thr340, a hinge residue for Src specificity,
has a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of LL-2003
in addition to a π-alkyl interaction with the phenyl group of
LL-2003. The side chain of Val283, part of the Gly loop in
Src, has formed a hydrophobic interaction with the phenyl
ring of LL-2003.
The docking result with IGF-1R shown in Figure 6E
also suggests that the phenyl group of oxadiazinone
has hydrophobic interactions with the N lobe residues
(Met1024 and Met1049), contributing to the stabilization
of LL-2003 in the binding site. In particular, Met1024

group at the C6 position [48]. Met1049, the gatekeeper
residue of IGF-1R, also has a π-alkyl interaction with
the phenyl group at C6. The O1 atom of LL-2003 has
a hydrogen bond with Asp1123 which is a part of the
conserved ‘DFG motif’ in kinases. As shown above, our

of both kinases have critical interactions with LL-2003
(Figure 6D and 6E). The amide proton of Met1052
(conserved hinge residue of IGF-1R) has a hydrogen bond
with the nitrile group of LL-2003 in IGF-1R (pdb: 3D94).
Threonine 340, part of the hinge region of Src, was
reported to interact with the known ligand (CGP77675)
via a hydrogen bond [46]. This residue, known to be
important for Src selectivity, retains a hydrogen bond with
the carbonyl oxygen of the oxadiazinone ring (Figure 6D,
shown as a green line). The data are consistent with the
common hinge binding contribution of kinase inhibitors,
suggesting dual inhibition through favorable hinge binding
for both kinases.

IGF-1R-targeted therapies have been anticipated
as a promising single-agent or combination regimen. The
canonical activation of IGF-1R stimulated by the binding
of ligands to IGF-IR [12], leads to the autophosphorylation
of tyrosine residues 1131, 1135, and 1136 in the
activation loop of the IGF-1R. Src, a non-receptor
protein tyrosine kinase, has been found to directly induce
IGF-1R phosphorylation [49]. Since Src and IGF-1R
are coactivated in most NSCLC cell lines and tumors in
patients [18] and plays an important role in cancer cell
survival and resistance to targeted anticancer therapies
[50, 51], and cancer cells appear to display resistance
to the IGF-1R-targeted agents through Src activation
[17, 18], we postulated that dual targeting of IGF-1R and
Src could be an effective way to overcome anticancer drug
resistance and dual IGF-1R/Src TKI regimens may offer
a novel opportunity for cancer therapy. In support of the
notion, our previous studies clearly revealed the potent
antitumor activities of co-targeting IGF-1R and Src in
various NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo [17, 18].
Although these results show the effectiveness
of combined treatment of IGF-1R and Src inhibitors in
NSCLC treatment, the main drawbacks of these strategies
are undesirable side effects. It is necessary to develop a
novel dual inhibitor that targets IGF-1R and Src. Hence,
our approach to develop dual IGF-1R/Src TKI began
with exploring 2-aryl-4H-1,3,4-oxadiazin-5(6H)-one as
a novel scaffold that is structurally unrelated to current
TKIs. The majority of small-molecular weight inhibitors
of tyrosine kinases have displayed limited variety in
chemical structures [52]. Famous examples are a urea

DISCUSSION
Numerous studies have shown the plasticity
of tumor cells in which the obstruction of particular
targets leads to activation of multiple compensatory
signaling pathways, resulting in an adaptive survival
of tumor cells and thus induction of drug resistance.
We have shown involvement of Src, which acts as
a common downstream node of multiple signaling
pathways initiated by membrane-associated receptors,
in resistance to IGF-1R inhibitors. The studies reported
herein demonstrate that LL-2003, a derivative of 2-aryl1,3,4-oxadiazin-5-ones, has promising anticancer
activities at least in part by blocking both IGF-1R and
Src (Figure S7). Our results provide pre-clinical support
for the use of LL-2003 as a dual IGF-1R and Src in the
treatment of lung cancer.

for sorafenib, 4-anilino-quinazolines for gefitinib and
erlotinib, and a phenyl-amino-pyrimidine for imatinib.
In addition, an efficient strategy to combat the emerging
drug-resistance in cancer therapy has been found to
develop a new scaffold whose chemical structure and
mode of binding are distinct from previous drugs. Imatinib
and nilotinib contain a phenyl-amino-pyrimidine, while
dasatinib, used for imatinib-resistant CML, possesses
an amino-thiazole moiety. Sunitinib, used for imatinibresistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), has an
indolinone unit.
Kinases are one of the most intensively pursued
drug targets, with almost 30,000 kinase inhibitors having
been reported in the public database [41]. Recently,
enormous efforts have been made to identify selectivity
determinants in kinases: inactive conformations, allosteric
sites, cysteine residues for irreversible binding, and the
gate keeper residues [53]. Out of 196,904 potential hinge
binding fragments retrieved from ZINC database, only
1% of those motifs are covered by kinase inhibitors [41].
Frequently used hinge binding motifs of kinases are

pyrimidine, pyridine, piperazine, and morpholine. Phenol
is preferred to generate type I1/2 inhibitors. These findings
suggest that a large part of chemical space has not yet been
explored. Toward this aim, we investigated oxadiazinone
derivatives to discover new heterocyclic compounds for
IGFR inhibition.
We developed a novel oxadiazinone scaffold from
our druggable peptoid library and improved anticancer
activity based on molecular docking analysis. Among
them, LL-2003 demonstrated promising antitumor
activities along with dual inhibition of IGF-1R and
Src. We found several features of LL-2003 that place
it as a lead compound for the development of novel
anticancer drugs. First, LL-2003 significantly inhibited
the proliferative activity in a panel of NSCLC cell lines
and their sublines with acquired chemoresistance cells.
LL-2003 also exhibited antitumor activity in a xenograft
tumor model bearing H1299 NSCLC cells. These findings
indicate the potential of LL-2003 for both first-line and
second-line therapies. Second, LL-2003 appeared to
induce apoptosis in several NSCLC cell lines. LL-2003

was derived from the peptoid-based library, which may
result in a distinct signaling indication compared to
current TKIs. Current IGF-IR mAb and TKIs do not
induce apoptosis while reducing cell viability [54]. We
have demonstrated induction of apoptosis in NSCLC
cells by the combined treatment with IGF-1R and Src
inhibitors [17, 18]. Consequently, a compound that
targets both IGF-1R and Src is expected to induce
apoptosis. In line with the same notion, dual inhibition
of IGF-1R and Src by the treatment with LL-2003
appeared to induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Third, the
rapid synthesis of LL-2003 within 3 steps can furnish a
good synthetic platform for a large library for enhanced
potency. Convenient synthesis of a large library along
with facile derivatization means that our oxadiazinone
compounds represent a new chemical scaffold for the
development of anticancer agents. Enormous efforts in
drug discovery have been directed toward controlling
apoptotic signals since the effectiveness of anticancer
drugs is associated with apoptosis in many cases. Many
protein-protein interaction modulators mimic intrinsic
apoptosis-modulating peptides with enhanced stability to
peptidases and are expected to be effective in apoptosis
signaling pathways [55]. There are many examples of
peptide-based therapeutics that target apoptosis [56, 57].
In particular, constrained peptoids were found to control
apoptosis [31, 58]. As such, the peptoid-based library
could provide the platform for the development of novel
anticancer drugs. These data show that LL-2003 could
be a potential anticancer drug targeting both IGF-1R
and Src.
Taken together, our findings provide the potential
of LL-2003 as an effective anticancer agent targeting
both IGF-1R and Src in human NSCLC. Many
peptidomimetics are developed for their anticancer
effects [59–62], but our work is the first example of
peptoid-based anticancer agents to our knowledge. The
knowledge obtained in this work may be incorporated to
design better anticancer agents, providing valuable tools
to understand drug resistance mechanisms in cancer
therapy.

from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA).
Antibody against cleaved PARP was purchased from
BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Antibodies
against Akt2 and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Linsitinib was
purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA).

Cell culture
H1299, H460, H1975, and A549 cells were
purchased from American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA). H226B and H226Br cells were
kindly provided by Dr. John V. Heymach (The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Welgene
Inc., Gyeongsan-si, Republic of Korea) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Cells
were maintained at 37oC in a humidified atmosphere
with 5%  CO2. To generate paclitaxel-resistant cells
(H460/R and H226B/R cells), H460 and H226B cells
were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations
of paclitaxel for more than 6 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
General instrumentation and chemicals
All solvents were purified and used in scrupulously
dry conditions. NMR spectra of all new compounds were
recorded on JEOL JLM-LA 300, Varian Gemini 2000,
Bruker AVANCE 500 operating at 300 MHz for 1H and
125 MHz for 13C NMR. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported
in ppm, downfield from the internal TMS standard.
Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried
out using precoated silica gel (E. Merck Kiesegel 60F254,
layer thickness 0.25 mm), and chromatography was
performed using silica gel 60 (40–60 μm).

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were obtained by modified RIPA lysis
buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.25% Sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100,
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN, USA), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche)]. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000  rpm

for  20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected, and
protein concentration was determined by BCA assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 20 μg of
proteins were subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE. Separated
proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were
blocked with blocking buffer [3% BSA in Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST)] for 1 h at
room temperature and followed by incubation with primary
antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. After
washing three times with TBST, membranes were incubated
with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were washed three times with TBST and were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

intraperitoneally administered with vehicle (10% DMSO
in corn oil) or LL-2003 (50 mg/kg) every day for 17 d.
Tumor growth was determined by measuring the short and
long diameters of the tumor with a caliper. Body weight
was measured to monitor toxicity. The tumor volume was
calculated using the following formula: tumor volume
(mm3) = (short diameter)2 × (long diameter) × 0.5.

Molecular docking analysis
Molecular docking studies were carried out using the
Surflex-Dock in Sybyl-X2.1.1 (Tripos Inc, St Louis, MO)
with the crystal structures of IGF-1R and Src complexed
with ligands (PDB: 3D94 for IGF-1R and 1YOL for Src).
The new ligands were prepared by generating 3D
conformations from 2D structures using Concord. The
protein was energy-minimized using conjugate gradient
minimization (Powell’s method) until the RMSD was
lower than 0.001 kcal/mol·Å. The original ligand was
removed and water molecules were also removed unless
involved in hydrogen bonding. Docking simulation
was carried out using Surflex-Dock GeomX mode. The
protomol was usually generated using a threshold of 0.5 Å
and bloat of 0 Å. Docking performance was validated
by examination of the RMSD of the re-docked structure
compared to the original pose. Molecular interactions
between ligand and protein were further analyzed using
Discovery studio 4.0 Visualizer.

MTT assay
To assess the effect of oxadiazinone derivatives
on the viability of NSCLC cells, the MTT assay was
performed as described previously [63, 64]. Cells
(1–2 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates) were treated with
increasing concentrations of the compounds for 3 d. Cells
were treated with MTT solution (final concentration of
200 μg/ml) and incubated for 2–4 h at 37°C. The formazan
products were dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm. The data are presented as a
percentage of the control group.

Statistics

Anchorage dependent colony formation assay

Data are presented as the mean ± SD. All in vitro
experiments were independently performed at least twice,
and a representative result is presented unless otherwise
indicated. The statistical significance was analyzed using
two-sided Student’s t-test using Microsoft Excel 2013
(Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). P values less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density
of 300–500 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were treated with
LL-2003 (0, 5, 25, and 50 μM). After 14 d, cells were fixed
with 100% methanol for 5 min at room temperature. Cells
were further stained with crystal violet solution (0.002%)
for 2 h, and then washed with water. Stained colonies were
photographed and counted.
