Abstract
The apoptotic ligand TRAIL is believed to have promise as a cancer gene therapy, yet many types of cancer,
including gliomas, have exhibited resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that therapeutic
combination of the lipoxygenase inhibitor MK886 and TRAIL-secreting human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCTRAIL) provide targeted and prolonged delivery of TRAIL both in vitro and in orthotopic mouse models of glioma.
Treatment of either TRAIL-sensitive or TRAIL-resistant human glioma cells with MK886 and MSC-TRAIL resulted
in signiﬁcantly enhanced apoptosis compared with each agent alone. MK886 effectively increased the sensitivity
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via upregulation of the death receptor 5 and downregulation of the antiapoptotic
protein survivin in human glioma cell lines and in primary glioma cells. This regulation was accompanied by a
substantial increase in caspase activation after combined treatment. Furthermore, in vivo survival experiments
and imaging analysis in orthotopic xenografted mice showed that MSC-based TRAIL gene delivery combined with
MK886 into the tumors had greater therapeutic efﬁcacy than single-agent treatment. Together, our ﬁndings
indicate that MK886 combined with MSC-based TRAIL gene delivery may represent a novel strategy for improving
the treatment of malignant gliomas. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4807–17. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common type of
primary brain tumor, is highly aggressive and invasive. The
median survival of GBM patients undergoing conventional
treatment (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) is
14.6 months for radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1
months for radiotherapy alone (1). The intrinsic high capacity
of these tumors to invade and inﬁltrate the adjacent functional
normal brain parenchyma, which hampers the complete surgical removal of tumors and results in tumor recurrence, and
their resistance to most chemotherapy agents available currently are the main obstacles to GBM treatment (2).
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have tumor-targeting properties, can be isolated easily, and can be engineered with viral
vectors, suggesting a potential clinical use in cancer gene
therapy (3, 4). The use of MSC-based gene therapy as an
effective therapeutic gene delivery vehicle represents a promAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Postech-Catholic Biomedical Engineering Institute,

ising strategy for improving the efﬁcacy of the treatment of
glioma. We and others have shown that MSCs can selectively
deliver therapeutic agents, such as immune-modulating, apoptosis-inducing, and suicide or prodrug converting genes, to
tumors and yield a signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy in glioma
models (5–10).
The TRAIL induces apoptosis selectively in transformed
cells, but not in most normal cells (11, 12), which renders it
a promising candidate for brain tumor therapy. TRAIL-based
cancer therapies with recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) or an
adenovirus bearing the TRAIL gene have been reported (13,
14); however, potential issues of toxicity and short protein halflife of rTRAIL remain to be addressed. In addition, the limitations of adenoviral gene therapy include the inﬁltration of the
brain parenchyma by outgrowing glioma cells. To extend the
release time of TRAIL and deliver it to inﬁltrated tumor cells,
we evaluated MSCs as delivery vehicles for TRAIL (7). However,
despite the expression of death-inducing TRAIL receptors (15),
many types of cancer, including most glioma cells, are resistant
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting that TRAIL alone may
be ineffective. Thus, the identiﬁcation of novel drugs that
sensitize glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis or of new
strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance is needed. Recent
reports showed that chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy
can enhance sensitivity to TRAIL by increasing the expression
of TRAIL receptors in a range of tumors (16, 17), suggesting that
a synergistic antitumor effect may be achieved by using
combination therapies.
COX-2 and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) are key enzymes involved
in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to eicosanoids (18).

These arachidonic acid metabolites (i.e., prostaglandins and
leukotrienes) are related to tumor development and progression (19, 20), thus pinpointing these enzymes as potential
therapeutic targets against cancer; moreover, their selective
inhibitors have been considered as antitumor agents (21, 22).
MK886, a speciﬁc inhibitor of the 5-LOX–activating protein,
induced antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, and breast cancer (23–25).
Previously, we also investigated the overexpression of 5-LOX
and the effect of MK886 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in
human malignant glioma cells (26). Importantly, celecoxib, a
COX-2 selective nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drug, exhibited
therapeutic activity in cancer and restored or enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL in a range of tumors (27, 28). Because these
two arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes (COX-2 and 5LOX) are so closely related regarding their mechanisms of
action and substrate, we hypothesized that a 5-LOX inhibitor,
such as MK886, could be a potent sensitizer to overcome the
resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in malignant gliomas.
In this study, ﬁrst we showed that malignant glioma cells
were sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis after administration of MK886, via modulation of the apoptotic machinery. In
addition, we found that a combined treatment using MK886
and MSC-delivered TRAIL (MSC-TRAIL) enhanced apoptosis
in glioma cells in vitro and tumor regression in mouse xenograft models in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Human MSCs and glioma cells
Primary human MSCs were obtained from PromoCell. These
cells are harvested from normal human bone marrow and their
ability to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes, chondrocytes,
and osteoblasts was tested according to the manufacturer's
instructions (29). These cells have also been tested for the
presence of surface antigens (CD44/CD105, >95% positive;
CD31/CD45, >95% negative). MSCs were cultured in Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium containing SupplementMix
(PromoCell) and were used for experiments during passages 5
to 8. Human glioma cell lines (U-87MG, U-138MG, U-251MG,
and U-373MG) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection, and primary glioma cells (GBM) were obtained
from fresh specimens of glioma-bearing patients who underwent surgery, after ethical approval and written informed
consent. Glioma cell lines and GBM cells were maintained in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM; Invitrogen). Normal human astrocytes were obtained from the Applied Cell
Biology Research Institute and cultured in DMEM. Fireﬂy
luciferase (Luc)-expressing U-87MG cells (U87-Luc) were stably transduced using a lentivirus expressing Luc (30). All cells
were supplemented with antibiotics and 10% FBS and were
incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5%
CO2.
Production of gene-modiﬁed MSCs
The adenovirus carrying the secretable trimeric form of the
TRAIL gene (Ad-TRAIL) was engineered as described previously (31). The recombinant replication-deﬁcient adenoviral
vector encoding the gene for enhanced green ﬂuorescent

protein (Ad-EGFP) was constructed using the AdEasy vector
system (Quantum Biotechnologies). Cell permeable peptidesmediated adenoviral transduction was carried out as described
previously (7, 32).
Transfection with siRNAs
TRAIL death receptor 5 (DR5), cyclophosphamide–Adriamycin–vincristine–prednisone (Oncovin; CHOP), and survivin
siRNAs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To
transfect tumor cells with siRNA, cells (2  105 cells per well)
were seeded into 6-well plates and transfection was carried out
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were exposed to a
scrambled siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mock transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 only was used as controls.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories) allowing sensitive colorimetric
assay by using highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt that is
reduced by dehydrogenases in living cells to give a colored
product (formazan). Glioma cells were seeded in 96- or 24-well
plates to measure TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and MK886mediated cell death. Cells were treated with MK886 (Merck),
rTRAIL (R&D Systems), or both reagents at adequate concentrations and were analyzed 48 hours later. For coculture
experiments, MSC-TRAIL were plated in Transwell inserts
with 0.4 mm pores (Corning Inc.) at various cell densities
and tumor cells (4  104) were grown in the lower well of the
24-well plates. For inhibition studies, DR5/Fc chimera protein
(100 ng/mL; R&D Systems) was added or anti-TRAIL (R&D
systems) and caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk (10 mmol/L; R&D
Systems) were preincubated for 1 hour at each experiment. The
cytotoxicity induced by another lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861
(Enzo Life Sciences), was also conﬁrmed using the method
described above. For the visualization of induced apoptosis,
U87-Luc cells were seeded in 96-well plates and analyzed
48 hours after treatment using the Maestro In Vivo Imaging
System (CRI Inc.).
Apoptosis analysis
Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining-based ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate Annexin
V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). U-87MG cells
(2  105 cells/well) were seeded in a 6-well plate, incubated
with MK886 (20 mmol/L) in the absence or presence of TRAIL
(10 ng/mL) for 24 hours, and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
(Moﬂo; Beckman Coulter Inc.).
Flow cytometry for death receptors
Cells were analyzed for the surface expression of TRAIL
death receptors using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antihuman DR4 and DR5 antibodies (R&D Systems), as described
previously (17). PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 (R&D Systems) was
used an isotype control.
Western blotting
Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analysis were
carried out as described previously (7). Proteins transferred

Therapeutic efﬁcacy in an orthotopic glioma xenograft
mouse model
Male athymic nude mice (6 to 8 weeks old; Charles River
Laboratories) were used in accordance with institutional
guidelines under the approved protocols. The intracranial
xenograft mouse model of human glioma was constructed as
described previously (7). To evaluate the therapeutic effects of
the combined treatment, MK886 was injected intraperitoneally
for 5 days (5 mg/kg in a mixture of saline) from 5 days after
tumor inoculation, and additional intratumoral single injection (1.25 mg/kg in a mixture of saline) was administered at the
last day of intraperitoneally injection. Subsequently, MSCTRAIL (2  105 cells in 5 mL of PBS) were transplanted
intratumorally at 10 days after tumor inoculation. To assess
the inhibition of tumor growth, the animals were inoculated

with U87-Luc and treated as described above. The substrate of
luciferase, D-luciferin (150 mg of luciferin/kg of body weight;
Xenogen), was delivered via intraperitoneally injection 10
minutes before direct visualization using the Maestro In Vivo
Imaging System (CRI Inc.).
Immunohistochemistry and in vivo apoptosis assay
To evaluate tumor growth inhibition using histologic analysis, mice were sacriﬁced at day 14 after tumor inoculation,
during the imaging experiment. Mouse brains were perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia. Fixed tissues were cyrosectioned (14 mm-thick sections) and then
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Apoptotic activity
was detected via staining using a terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay kit (Roche) and developed with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Nuclei were
counterstained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma).
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as means  SEM from at least 3
independent experiments. Statistical differences between different test conditions were determined using Student t test.
Probability values less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
MK886 sensitizes glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis
First, we determined the cytotoxicity of rTRAIL or MK886
alone in human glioma cells. Most of the human glioma cell
lines and GBM were resistant to TRAIL (Fig. 1A), and MK886
treatment exhibited a cytotoxic effect in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). Another 5-LOX inhibitor, AA861, also
induced cell death in a pattern that was similar to that
observed for the MK886 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Next, we examined whether TRAIL treatment combined with
MK886 enhanced the cytotoxic effect. A subtoxic dose of
MK886 (20 mmol/L) induced cell death signiﬁcantly in the
presence of 100 ng/mL TRAIL in U-87MG, U-138MG, and GBM
cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that MK886 strongly sensitizes cells to
TRAIL-induced cell death. We also examined the effect of
MK886 on the TRAIL-induced apoptosis by Annexin V/PIbased ﬂow cytometric analysis. The respective percentages of
apoptotic cells were 14% or 17% when treated with MK886 or
TRAIL (Fig. 1D). However, we found that apoptosis was dra-

matically increased to 62% by the combination of the two.
Although we showed enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis after
treatment with MK886 in several glioma cells, there was only a
slight or no effect after treating U-251MG and U-373MG cells,
which have high resistance at this concentration of TRAIL.
Therefore, the identiﬁcation of a more powerful modality that
induces cell death by treatment with a high concentration of
TRAIL is of great importance.
Effect of MSC-TRAIL together with MK886 in TRAILresistant glioma cells
We previously found that MSC-based gene therapy had the
advantages of offering continuous and concentrated local
delivery of secretable TRAIL (7). Thus, we used MSC-TRAIL
in the present study to overcome the resistance to rTRAIL.
First, we examined the cytotoxic effects of MK886 and TRAIL
on MSCs (Fig. 2A) or normal human astrocytes (data not
shown), because it is important that MK886 and TRAIL do
not induce cell death to the delivery vehicle (MSCs) or normal
cells in the therapeutic setting. MSCs are resistant to both
the combination and single-agent treatments. In addition,
DR5 expression levels did not change in MK886-treated MSCs
(Fig. 2B). We also showed that MSC-TRAIL had greater

therapeutic efﬁcacy than rTRAIL by coculture experiments
with U-87MG (Fig. 2C). On the basis of these ﬁndings, we
examined whether treatment with MSC-TRAIL combined with
MK886 had the effect on cell death in U-251MG and U-373MG
cells. Coculture experiments showed that MSC-TRAIL combined with MK886 had therapeutic efﬁcacy in these cell lines,
and that the TRAIL-mediated cell death was conﬁrmed by
inhibition assay (Fig. 2D and E). These results suggest that
MSC-based TRAIL gene therapy combined treatment with
MK886 potently enhances apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant human
glioma cells.
MK886 upregulates the expression of DR5 in glioma cells
Several chemotherapeutic agents enhance TRAIL-induced
apoptosis through upregulation of the TRAIL-mediated
death receptors in many types of cancer. Thus, we examined
whether treatment with MK886 had an effect on death
receptor expression in glioma cells. Flow cytometry and
Western blot analysis showed that MK886 induced

www.aacrjournals.org

DR5 expression in a dose-dependent manner in U-87MG
(Fig. 3A and B) and other glioma cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2). The expression of another death receptor, DR4, was
not affected by MK886 treatment (data not shown). To
conﬁrm that the increase of apoptosis is mediated by DR5
upregulation, we used the DR5/Fc chimeric protein to block
the interaction between DR5 and TRAIL. Treatment with 5LOX inhibitors (MK886 and AA861) and TRAIL alone slightly
induced cell death, whereas the combined treatment
markedly induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C); however, DR5/Fc
efﬁciently blocked the apoptosis induced by cotreatment
(Fig. 3C and D). We also showed a dose-dependent increase
in DR5 levels and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis after
treatment with AA861 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B).
Moreover, to determine the role of DR5 in TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, we used an siRNA speciﬁc to DR5, which blocked
the upregulation of DR5 after MK886 treatment (Fig. 3E).
The effect of MK886 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis was effectively abolished in cells transfected with DR5 siRNA (Fig. 3F).

These results indicate that induction of DR5 could be a
mechanism of which MK886 enhances the TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in glioma cells.
MK886-induced DR5 upregulation is mediated through
induction of CHOP
Several studies have shown that the expression of death
receptors can be induced by p53 and CHOP (33, 34). Thus, we
determined to see whether these transcription factors are
involved in MK886-induced DR5 upregulation. Western blot
analysis showed that DR5 expression was markedly increased
after treatment and that MK886 induced CHOP expression but
had no effect on the expression of p53 (Fig. 4A). To elucidate the
role of CHOP in MK886-induced upregulation of DR5, we used
an siRNA speciﬁc to CHOP, which blocked the upregulation of
CHOP after MK886 treatment. Whereas MK886 upregulated
the expression of DR5 in nontransfected and control-transfected U-87MG cells, transfection with CHOP siRNA suppressed MK886-induced DR5 upregulation (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
the suppression of CHOP by siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced the
effects of MK886 on TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). These
results indicate that CHOP plays an important role in DR5
upregulation and contributes to the sensitizing effect of MK886
on TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins after MK886
treatment
Antiapoptotic proteins are expressed at high levels in many
tumors, including glioma, and have been associated with
refractory disease and poor prognosis (35, 36). To identify
intracellular signaling events responsible for the MK886-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, the expression
of the antiapoptotic proteins FLIP, survivin, and XIAP by the
treatment of MK886 was examined. Glioma cells showed a
dose-dependent decrease in FLIP-L protein levels, with the
exception of 1 cell line (U-138MG), and 2 glioma cell lines (U138MG and U-251MG) showed decrease in XIAP levels (Fig.
5A). More importantly, all glioma cells exhibited downregulation of survivin. In contrast, the levels of other apoptosisrelated proteins, Bcl-XL and Bax (data not shown), were not
modulated in any of the cell lines tested. Next, we veriﬁed
whether the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was increased by
downregulation of survivin. To verify whether apoptosis factors are affected by survivin knockdown, we measured the
levels of a major effector of caspase (caspase-3) and DR5 (Fig.
5B). The results revealed no differences in the expression levels
of procaspase-3; however, DR5 expression was increased by
survivin knockdown. More importantly, knockdown of survivin
in U-87MG cells induced more apoptosis than that observed in
control-transfected cells after TRAIL treatment (Fig. 5C). These
results showed that survivin is an important protein in elucidating the resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
MK886 augments TRAIL-induced activation of caspases
Next, we investigated whether the enhanced TRAIL-induced
apoptosis observed after MK886 treatment is mediated by
caspase activation (Fig. 5D). First, we investigated the levels
of receptor-related proteins in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Caspase-8 was more cleaved into the active fragments after the
combined treatment compared with treatment with TRAIL
alone. The intrinsic pathway also became activated, as shown
by the cleavage of Bid and caspase-9. Ultimately, the combination treatment caused signiﬁcant cleavage of caspase-3, a
major effector caspase. Importantly, TRAIL-alone treatment
yielded only weak caspase cleavage, and MK886 alone did not
induce caspase cleavage, indicating that MK886 enhanced
apoptosis strongly via TRAIL-mediated caspase activation. In
addition, caspase-dependent sensitizing effect of MK886 on
TRAIL-induced apoptosis was conﬁrmed by using the caspase

and MSC-TRAIL was more restricted than that induced by the
control or single-agent treatments (Fig. 6D), and the combined
treatment also induced greater apoptosis compared with the
single-agent treatment, as shown by TUNEL staining (Fig. 6E).
Interestingly, apoptotic cells were detected only in the tumor
mass and were not seen in normal brain parenchyma, suggesting that the treatment induced tumor cell death speciﬁcally,
and thus had no adverse toxic side effects. Taken together,
these results show that the combination of MSC-TRAIL with
MK886 is a potent therapeutic approach against malignant
glioma.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that the 5-LOX inhibitor MK886
sensitized glioma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and

4814

Cancer Res; 72(18) September 15, 2012

provided evidence that the combined therapy for MK886
and TRAIL is a more powerful modality compared with
treatment using a single agent against glioma, both in vitro
and in vivo. Moreover, we showed that MSC-based TRAIL
delivery efﬁciently enhanced the therapeutic potential of the
combined treatment by providing a continuous and substantial amount of TRAIL to glioma cells that were sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by treatment with MK886.
Although several mechanisms have been implicated in
TRAIL resistance, in the present study we veriﬁed that
treatment with MK886 had the potential to overcome TRAIL
resistance by decreasing in the expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins related to the apoptotic signaling pathway at different stages of the caspase cascade, and increasing in death receptor-mediated apoptosis directly.

Combined Therapy with MSC-TRAIL and MK886

In particular, several groups, including ours, have reported
the use of MSCs expressing secretable TRAIL, which has
been shown to be a potent anticancer agent in experimental
glioma models (7, 8, 37, 38) and found an effective therapeutic potential by overcoming some of the hurdles of
conventional TRAIL-based treatments that use soluble
rTRAIL protein or agonistic antibodies to DR5 (39, 40).
However, an additional issue with TRAIL-based therapy,
that is, the resistance of tumor cells to TRAIL, remains
unaddressed. In a previous report, we showed that the
combination of MSC-TRAIL and irradiation synergistically
enhances the antitumor effect by increasing the expression
of TRAIL receptors in the treatment of glioma (17). In this
study, MK886 also effectively potentiated TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by augmenting cell death in TRAIL-responsive
glioma cells and by sensitizing TRAIL-resistant cells through
a DR5-mediated pathway, which was also veriﬁed by experiments using DR5-speciﬁc knockdown. However, there was
only one exception in the present study, ﬂow cytometry
analysis showed that MK886 did not induce DR5 expression
in U-251MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although upregulation of DR5 expression was not detected, coculture
experiments showed that MSC-TRAIL combined with
MK886 had therapeutic efﬁcacy (Fig. 2D), indicating that it
is cell-type speciﬁc and other mechanisms of TRAIL-sensitizing effect including downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins, FLIP, survivin, and XIAP (Fig. 5A), could be related. In
addition, we showed that treatment with MSC-based TRAIL
gene therapy is more effective and useful than treatment
using rTRAIL, especially human glioma cells that are highly
TRAIL-resistant, indicating the advantageous effect of the
cell-mediated delivery of TRAIL.
Resistance to TRAIL can be overcome by combining
TRAIL-based agents with chemotherapeutic drugs, irradiation, or other novel therapeutic drugs in a variety of tumor
types, however, the resistance to TRAIL may have various
causes. Given the enhanced effects of MK886 and TRAIL
in the present study, the identiﬁcation of intracellular
signaling events that are responsible for the MK886-mediated sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is of particular importance. Several molecular mechanisms have
been revealed in TRAIL resistance, including intracellular
blockage of the apoptotic-signaling pathway by downregulation of proapoptotic proteins or upregulation of
antiapoptotic proteins. The best-characterized inhibitor
of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is FLIP, which blocks the
death signal at the level of the receptor by occupying
the caspase-8 binding site on the Fas-associated protein
with death domain, thus inhibiting the activation and
cleavage of caspase-8 (41). Another important point related
to the resistance to TRAIL, downstream of the receptors,
is the high expression of conserved proteins of the family
of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP), including XIAP,
c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and survivin, which can block the activation and/or activity of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (42). Although
the expression of antiapoptotic proteins did not decrease
equally, MK886 treatment caused a marked decrease in
the expression levels of survivin in all glioma cells tested in

www.aacrjournals.org

this study. Interestingly, the suppression of survivin by
siRNA enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and Western
blot analysis after survivin knockdown showed no activation of procaspase-3, indicating a caspase-independent cell
death mechanism. This observation is in agreement with
ﬁndings from previous report that described a caspaseindependent and DR5-mediated sensitizing effect on
TRAIL-induced cell death by silencing of survivin (43).
These results suggest that the MK886-induced downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins could be one mechanism
by which TRAIL-induced apoptosis is potentiated. Thus,
the use of drugs targeting survivin could be beneﬁcial to the
therapy against glioma.
Although many agents that possess antitumor effects have
been reported, the efﬁcacy of single agents is insufﬁcient.
Therefore, identifying clinically safe drugs that, when administered concomitantly, sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL by
generating new effects, rather than just adding the effects of
the 2 agents, is of great importance. Moreover, understanding the intracellular mechanisms underlying the overcoming
of the resistance to TRAIL is important for the development
of novel and efﬁcient modalities of combined treatment. In
the present study, we showed for the ﬁrst time that the
combined therapy markedly induced apoptosis at suboptimal concentrations of MK886 and long-acting TRAIL delivered by MSCs in glioma cells, both in vitro and in vivo, with
the ﬁndings suggesting that MK886 is a sensitizing or
augmenting agent in cells that are sensitive or resistant to
TRAIL-induced cell death.
