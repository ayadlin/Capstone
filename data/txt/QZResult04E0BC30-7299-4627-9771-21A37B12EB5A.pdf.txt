GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT

ABSTRACT
The newly discovered short (9 amino acid) non-RGD S-S bridged cyclic peptide
ALOS-4 (H-cycl(Cys-Ser-Ser-Ala-Gly-Ser-Leu-Phe-Cys)-OH), which binds to integrin
avβ3 is investigated as peptide carrier for targeted drug delivery against human
metastatic melanoma. ALOS4 binds specifically the avβ3 overexpressing human
metastatic melanoma WM-266-4 cell line both in vitro and in ex vivo assays. Coupling
ALOS4 to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin (ALOS4-CPT) increases
the cytotoxicity of CPT against human metastatic melanoma cells while reduces
dramatically the cytotoxicity against non-cancerous cells as measured by the levels of
gH2A.X, active caspase 3 and cell viability. Moreover, conjugating ALOS4 to CPT even
increases the chemo-stability of CPT under physiological pH. Bioinformatic analysis
using Rosetta platform revealed potential docking sites of ALOS4 on the avβ3 integrin
which are distinct from the RGD binding sites. We propose to use this specific non-RGD
cyclic peptide as the therapeutic carrier for conjugation of drugs in order to improve
efficacy and reduce toxicity of currently available treatments of human malignant
melanoma.

ineffective, but recent successes in the development
of new therapies including mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, anti-Cytotoxic
T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1)/ Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
(PD-L1) `blocking antibodies have all yielded promising
results, enlarging the variety of therapeutic options for
patients [1, 2].

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is the most deadly skin cancer, frequently
associated with metastasis and poor survival prognosis
[1]. According to the National Cancer Institute 76,690
people were diagnosed with melanoma in 2013 in the
United States and 9,480 death accidents reported. Until
now, systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma has been

Yet, the above mentioned therapies are still in
development, and chemotherapy still remains the major
treatment against metastatic melanoma [3]. The modest
activity of single drug against metastatic melanoma has
raised the possibility to use combinations of cytotoxic
agents in order to improve outcomes (such as the
combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel that is currently
an NCCN cited “community standard” for treatment of
patients with metastatic disease), but limited success
has been achieved [4–8]. There have also been efforts
to combine more than 2 cytotoxic agents, such as the
Dartmouth regimen (combining cisplatin, dacarbazine,
carmustine and tamoxifen), however it failed to show
any statistically significant benefit [9, 10]. Furthermore,
the cytotoxic effects of such drug “cocktail” treatments
are severe and often intolerable by patients. Thus, new
targeted drug delivery approaches are needed to overcome
toxicological problems and improve efficacy.
One of the most effective techniques to achieve
selective delivery of drugs is based on targeting overexpressed receptors on the surface of cancer cells.
Integrins, for example, are a family of 24 known distinct
cell surface receptors [11], whose variety of key roles in the
neoplastic process has been thoroughly established [12].
Integrins are essential for tumor progression, and therefore
are attractive targets for selective therapeutic intervention
[13, 14] and drug delivery [15, 16]. Integrins are generally
recognized by the “RGD tripeptide sequence” [17–19] and
consequently many peptides bearing this recognition motif
have been found to be effective ligands for the selective
delivery of chemotherapeutics [15].
The use of peptides as targeting carriers is very
intriguing due to their ease of synthesis, structural simplicity
and high selectivity [20]. The most hopeful RGD peptide to
date has been the selective αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin antagonist
cilengitide [15, 21], which reached Phase III clinical trials for
the treatment of glioblastoma [22] and several other tumors
[13, 22]. However, failure in demonstrating an adequate
therapeutic and targeted effectiveness in clinical trials led to
discontinued development [23]. Further complicating the use
of RGD peptides as a chemotherapeutic delivery method is
the finding that, paradoxically, some RGD-based inhibitors
can enhance, rather than suppress, tumor progression.
Reynolds et al. found that the continuous infusion of very
low concentrations of RGD-mimetic inhibitors stimulates
tumor growth and angiogenesis by promoting VEGFinduced endothelial cell migration [24]. Given these
significant obstacles with RGD peptides, it is clear that
alternative integrin-specific antagonistic peptide carriers
are needed for targeted delivery of conjugated anticancer
payloads to malignant melanoma cells for reducing toxicity
and increasing efficacy.
Our research proposes to address these concerns by
utilizing the newly discovered short (9 amino acids) nonRGD cyclic peptide ALOS4 (H-cycl(Cys-Ser-Ser-AlaGly-Ser-Leu-Phe-Cys)-OH) that binds to a non-RGD site
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

upon integrin αvβ3 [25]. Here we show that ALOS4 binds
specifically human malignant melanoma cells both in
vitro and in vivo. We were also able to conjugate the anticancer drug Camptothecin (CPT) to ALOS4 to achieve
increased chemo-stability of CPT as well as specific
internalization of CPT into human malignant melanoma
cells to successfully induce DNA damage and tumor cell
death. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis suggests that
ALOS-4 non-RGD binding site in integrin αvβ3 is between
the Thigh domain and the Calf-1 domain of αv. Thus,
ALOS4 has the potential to become a targeted drug carrier
for treatment of human malignant melanoma.

RESULTS
The non-RGD cyclic peptide ALOS4
specifically binds human melanoma cells both
in vitro and in vivo
The non-RGD cyclic peptide ALOS4 has been
shown to specifically bind mouse melanoma cells [25].
Usage of ALOS4 for therapeutics purposes will require
specific binding to human melanoma cells. To evaluate
ALOS4 ability to bind human malignant melanoma cells,
the binding of FITC-labeled ALOS4 (ALOS4-FITC)
to the human malignant melanoma cell line WM-2664 was determined by FACS analysis (Figure 1). WM266-4 cells express high levels of the integrin αvβ3 in
contrast to the non-malignant HEK293 cells (Figure 1A,
Supplementary Figure S1). As expected, ALOS4-FITC
specifically bound WM-266-4 cells in a concentrationdependent manner, while not affected by a non-specific
peptide (Figure 1B-1D).
Next, we evaluated if ALOS4 binding is strong and
specific enough to target human malignant melanoma
cells inside the animal. Nude mice bearing 100 mm3
tumors of subcutaneously injected WM-266-4 cells were
intravenously administered with ALOS4-FITC. After 24
hours ALOS4-FITC was found to accumulate specifically
in the tumor rather than in other organs (Figure 2). Thus,
ALOS4 is able to specifically target malignant melanoma
cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Coupling ALOS4 to CPT
Previous work has shown that although ALOS-4 can
bind murine melanoma cells and inhibit their migration
it does not affect cell viability and proliferation [25]. To
add a cytotoxic activity to ALOS-4 we coupled it to the
topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT [26]. ALOS4 peptide was
synthesized using solid phase organic synthesis (SPOS).
The cyclic peptide core was assembled on a 2-chlorotrityl
chloride resin solid support using standard Fmoc solid phase
peptide synthesis (SPPS) and coupled to CPT (Figure 3).
Next, we confirmed that CPT can localize to the
cell nucleus even when coupled to ALOS4. For that

purpose, WM-266-4 cells were incubated with 10 μM
of either CPT or ALOS4-CPT and the intracellular
localization of CPT was monitored by confocal analysis
of live cells. CPT can be detected due to its fluorescence
properties, with an emission maximum at 435 nm [27].
As shown in Figure 4, incubation of the cells with the
drugs for 1 h resulted in accumulation of CPT inside
the nucleus and to some less degree in the lysosome.
Interestingly, the intracellular localization of CPT that
was pre-coupled to ALOS4 was similar to free CPT.
Thus, CPT can still accumulate inside the nucleus when
coupled to ALOS4.

incubations times revealed that only after more than 100
h of incubation at pH 7.4 40% of the ALOS4-conjugated
CPT underwent lactone ring opening (Figure 5B). In
acidic pH that stabilizes the lactone state of CPT the
conjugation to ALOS4 did not accelerate the lactone ring
opening (Figure 5A, 5C). Hence, CPT conjugation to
ALOS4 through ring E increases CPT chemo-stability in
physiological pH of 7.4.

Chemo-stability tests of ALOS4-CPT conjugate
vs free CPT

Topoisomerase I inhibition by CPT results in DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) due to collisions between
replication forks and stalled Topoisomerase 1 [31] as
well as in inhibition of replication due to prevention of
DNA uncoiling [32]. It is thought that both mechanisms
induce cell death [33, 34]. The successful internalization
of ALOS4-CPT that is followed by nuclear accumulation
of CPT (Figure 4) led to evaluate the toxicity of ALOS4CPT. For that purpose we monitored the formation of
DSBs by the levels of γH2A.X (a phosphorylated form of
the histone isoform H2A.X) and the induction of cell death
by the levels of active caspase 3. Addition of ALOS4-CPT
to WM-266-4 human malignant melanoma cells for 24
hours resulted in ~11 and ~13-fold increases in the levels
of γH2A.X and active caspase 3, respectively (Figure 6A).
These changes were similar to the changes in the positive
control treatment of CPT alone for 24 hours. At the shorter
time point (3 hours) caspase 3 did not undergo activation
in any treatment while an increase in γH2A.X was
monitored in CPT-treated cells and to less extent in ALO4CPT-treated cells (Figure 6A). To monitor the specificity
of this treatment we repeated the experiment using the

ALOS4-CPT conjugate induces DNA damage
and cell death specifically in malignant
melanoma cells

The stability of the anticancer peptide drug
conjugate ALOS4-CPT in hemolytic and proteolytic
environments is of significant importance for therapeutic
applications. CPT, under such conditions, is prone to
lactone ring opening to carboxylate followed by its
deactivation [28]. Therefore, ALOS4-CPT conjugate
should exhibit satisfactory stability until it is taken up
by the cancer cells. We compared the chemo-stability
of ALOS4-CPT conjugate to free CPT in two different
pH values; a physiological pH of 7.4 and an acidic pH
of 4.5, as the microenvironment in lysosomes [29, 30],
while the solutions were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots
were taken at selected time intervals and analyzed by
LC–MS (Figure 5).
As expected, CPT alone went rapid opening of ring
E: following 5 h of incubation at pH 7.4 almost 40% of
the CPT underwent lactone ring opening to carboxylate.
However, only 6% of CPT underwent lactone ring opening
once conjugated to ALOS4 (Figure 5A). Prolonged

non-malignant HEK293 cells (Figure 6B). Interestingly,
in HEK293 cells treatment with ALOS4-CPT did not lead
to an increase in the levels of γH2A.X at both time points,
while active caspase 3 levels were increased moderately
only at the 24 hours’ time point. On the other hand CPT
treatment led to almost 2 fold increase in the levels of both
markers at the 3 hours’ time point and more than 5-fold
increase in the levels of active caspase 3 at the 24 hours’
time point (Figure 6B). Thus, fusion of CPT to ALO4
gives specificity to the CPT-induced intracellular damage.
To evaluate whether ALOS4-CPT intracellular
damage results in cell death we monitored the amount of
viable cells following 48 hours treatment of ALOS-CPT as
well as of CPT alone and two additional anti-cancer drugs:
Azatoxin (AZA) and Amonafide (AM). Treatment of WM266-4 cells with 10μM of ALOS4-CPT resulted in reduction
of cell survival to 30% of the control cells, while treatments
with a similar concentration of CPT, AZA and AM resulted
in reductions in cell survival to 65%, 68% and 48% of the
control cells, respectively. In agreement with previous results
from mouse melanoma cells [25] ALOS4 by itself reduced
the survival rate of WM-266-4 very moderately to 91% of
the control cells (Figure 7A). To monitor the specificity of
ALOS4-CPT treatment, we repeated the experiment using
the non-malignant HEK293 cells. As expected, CPT, Aza
and AM reduced significantly the survival rate of the cells
to 16%, 44% and 27% of the control cells, respectively.
However, fusion of CPT to ALOS4 resulted in a relatively

moderate reduction in the survival rate of the cells to 77% of
the control cells (Figure 7B).

Modeling of ALOS4 binding to integrin αvβ3
To gain insight regarding the possible mechanism of
binding of ALOS4 to integrin αvβ3 we used protein-peptide
docking simulations using the Rosetta software [35]. For
the simulations the receptor structure of the αvβ3 that has
been determined experimentally by Xiong et al. [36] was
used and the 3D structure of the ALOS4 peptide was
predicted computationally using the PEP-FOLD 1.5 server
[37]. Overall, 10000 global docking trials were calculated
between ALOS4 (ligand) and αvβ3 integrin (receptor)
in order to exhaustively explore all possible binding
possibilities. The simulation results were ranked according
to the binding energy and the twenty lowest energy ones
(best binding modes) were further analyzed. Interestingly,
twelve out of the best twenty docked positions cluster at
the interface between the Thigh domain and the Calf-1
domain of αv below the Genu (Figure 8A, red arrowhead).
At this region the α and β integrin tails fold back at a
~135° angle, forming a V-shaped structure [36]. Whereas,
only two of the best twenty docked positions localize to
the RGD binding site (Figure 8A, orange arrowhead).Two
stretches of amino acids form the binding site, D550 –
T553 (Thigh domain) and D682 – L693 (Calf-1 domain)
are shown as sticks (Figure 8B).

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Integrin αvβ3 is considered a possible target for
cancer therapy since it is over-expressed in several
types of cancer such as melanoma, prostate cancer
and breast cancer. In the past years vast efforts were
made to develop specific and safe clinical tools to
target integrin αvβ3 for cancer therapy [23]. However,
to date no such drug has reached the market. Here
we tried to target integrin αvβ3 by ALOS4, a newly
discovered short and cyclic peptide [25]. Unlike the
various integrin αvβ3 binding peptides that have been
developed so far, ALOS4 does not contain an RGD
motif. Indeed our simulation predicts that ALOS4
docking site in integrin αvβ3 is not the RGD binding site,
but the twisted region of the integrin, which is mainly
exposed while the integrin is in its bent conformation
(Figure 8). According to most current models of integrin
function, when inactive, the integrin headpiece is in a
bent conformation pointing towards the cell membrane.
In this conformation the RGD binding domain has low
affinity for ligands. Upon activation by both intracellular
proteins and extracellular ligands, a conformational
change is induced that shifts the integrin to an extended
conformation with an increased binding affinity to
ligands [38]. We hypothesize that the unique binding
site of ALOS4 may prevent integrin activation upon the
peptide binding.
Apparently, ALOS4 binding to integrin αvβ3 is
strong enough to enable its accumulation on αvβ3 highly
expressing cells such as the human melanoma cell line
WM-266-4 both in vitro and even in vivo in a xenograft
model (Figure 1-2). Moreover, ALOS4 binding to integrin
αvβ3 enables its internalization along with CPT coupled to it
that is followed by nuclear accumulation of CPT (Figure 4).
CPT accumulation in the nucleus results in DNA damage
and induction of cell death (Figure 6-7). Hence, coupling
of CPT to ALOS4 does not interfere with CPT cytotoxic
effects, while contributing a specific targeting tool to
integrin αvβ3 highly expressing cells, namely cancer cells.
Still, the anti-cancer cytotoxic effects of ALOS4CPT are dependent on the stability of the conjugate in
hemolytic and proteolytic environments. In this respect,
the chemical instability of CPT due to the lactone
ring opening that leads to its deactivation is a major
obstacle [34]. Several publications reported on various
methods for enhancement of lactone stability of CPT,
all based on slight structural modifications like in the
E-ring of Homocamptothecin [39] and linkage of CPT
to glucuronide [40]. Here we conjugated ALOS4 to
CPT through ring E in CPT, a linkage that slows down
the lactone ring opening in basic physiological pH (7.4)
(Figure 5). Thus, ALOS4-CPT is more stable than free
CPT potentiating its utilization in TDD. Overall, our data
suggest that ALOS4 can become a targeted carrier of
cytotoxic drugs for treatment of human melanoma.

Cell lines

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

WM-266-4 human metastatic melanoma cell line
and HEK 293 cell line were cultured in RPMI medium
(R8758, Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) supplemented with 2
mM glutamine (G7513, Sigma, Rehovt, Israel), 10%
fetal bovine serum (F7524, Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) and
penicillin and streptomycin (100 IU/ml each) (P4333,
Sigma, Rehovot, Israel).

Solid phase synthesis of ALOS4 conjugates
General information
CPT, Fluorescein isothiocyanate, all protected
amino acids, resin and coupling reagents were purchased
from Tzamal D-Chem Laboratories Ltd, Petah-Tikva,
Israel. Azatoxin, [41, 42] and Amonafide [30] were
synthesized according to literature procedures. All the
solvents were purchased from Bio-Lab Ltd. Jerusalem,
Israel or Gas Technologies Ltd. Kefar Saba, Israel. All
other chemicals were purchased from Holland Moran or
Sigma-Aldrich.
The synthesis of the cyclic peptides was done
by a previously described procedure [43–48]. Briefly,
2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (1.12 mmol/gr) was placed
in a reactor and suspended in DCM under nitrogen
atmosphere. Then a mixture of Fmoc-Cys(Acm)-OH
(2 eq.) and DIPA (8 eq.) in DCM was added. The resin
loading reaction was allowed to proceed for 4-5 hr and
then the resin was capped by an addition of a few drops
of methanol. The Fmoc protecting group was removed
with 20% piperidine/DMF (3 x 7 min) and then a linear
SPPS was applied using standard Fmoc procedures
introducing the AA in the following order: FmocPhe-OH, Fmoc-Leu-OH, Fmoc-Ser(t-Bu)-OH, FmocGly-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Ser(t-Bu)-OH, FmocCys(Acm)-OH and Fmoc-GABA-OH (MS Spectra is
shown in Supplementary Figure S2). All the couplings
were performed in DMF with 3-fold excess of AA and 6
eq. of DIPA, using PyBop for activation. Each coupling
cycle was conducted for 2-3 hr. The completion of each
coupling reaction and Fmoc removal were monitored by
the ninhydrin test. After the coupling of the last AA, the
sequence was cyclized by I2, washed and N-terminus
Fmoc was deprotected yielding the cyclic peptidyl
residue ready for drug conjugation. The scrambled
peptide was synthesized using the same method as
described previously, while randomly replacing the first
4 amino acids at the C terminus.
Synthesis of ALOS4 conjugates to FITC and CPT
The peptidyl resin was washed and a DCM
solution of FITC and DIEA (FITC (2 eq.), DIEA
(8 eq)) or a DMF/DCM (1:1) solution of premade
764

4-nitrophenylcarbonate derivative of CPT (anticancer
agent (1.2 eq.), 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate (1.2 eq.),
DMAP (1.2 eq.), DIPA (3 eq.) in DCM, 3h, rt) [49] were
added correspondingly to the exposed primary amine for
overnight at rt. The resin was thoroughly washed and
the peptide conjugates were cleaved from the polymeric
support with the cold TFA cocktail (95% TFA, 2.5%
TIS, 2,5% H2O). The solvents were removed under a
gentle flow of N2 and then the crude was precipitated
from Et2O. Purification on semi-preparative HPLC by the
method mentioned above provided the final conjugates
to FITC and CPT, respectively. For the FITC conjugate:
(42% yield, purity 95%)LC-MS:RT = 8.66 min;MS: ESIMS m/z calcd: 1345.41 found: 673.8 (M2H++/2), 684.7
(MHNa++/2), 692.8 (MHK++/2) (Supplementary Figure
S3). For the CPT conjugate: (34% yield, purity 93%) LCMS: RT = 9.99 min; MS: ESI-MS m/z calcd: 1330.46
found: 666.3 (M2H++/2), 677.3 (MHNa++/2), 685.1
(MHK++/2) (Supplementary Figure S4).

Column temperature was kept at 50°C. The flow rate was
of 0.4 ml/min. The MS fragmentor was tuned on 100V on
positive or negative mode.

Chemo-stability
0.1 mM CPT and ALOS4-CPT were incubated in
acetate buffer at pH 4.5 and in PBS at pH 7.4 at 37 °C.
During the incubation period (24h - 144h), aliquots were
removed at different time intervals, filtered and analyzed
by LC-MS.

FACS analysis
For evaluating integrin αvβ3 expression and
ALOS4-FITC binding the cells were washed with
PBS and scrapped from the culture flask. 106 of cells
were incubated with 20 μL of ready for use FITC
conjugated mouse anti-human CD51/CD61 antibody
that specifically binds αvβ3 integrin (#555505, BD
Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) or with ALOS4FITC at the indicated concentrations with or without
a competitor scrambled peptide at 4°C for 45 min for
the antibody or 2 hours for the peptides. Following
two washings with PBS the cells were re-suspended
in 400 μL of PBS and analyzed with Becton Dickson
FACSCalibur cell analyzer equipped with an argonion laser (15W) at 488 nm with a 530/30 DF filter.
For each sample ~ 104 cells were analyzed. FlowJo
software was used to analyze the collected data. For
background measurement the cells were treated at the
same conditions but without adding the antibody or the
FITC-labeled peptide.

High performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)
All HPLC purifications were done via reverse
phase on ECOM semi-preparative system with dual UV
detection at 254 and 214 nm. Phenomenex Gemini® 10
μm C18 110 Å, LC 250 x 21.2 mm prep column was
utilized. The column was kept at room temperature. The
eluent solvents were 0.1% TFA in H2O (A) and 0.1% TFA
in ACN (B). A typical elution was a gradient of 100%
A to 50% B over 45 min at a flow rate of 25 mL/min.
Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on an UltiMate 3000
system (Dionex) using a Vydac C18 column (250 x 4.6
mm) with 5 μm silica (300 Å pore size). Linear gradient
elution (0 min 0% B; 5 min 0% B; 50 min 90% B) with
eluent A (0.1% TFA in water) and eluent B (0.1% TFA in
acetonitrile: H2O (80:20, v/v)) was used at a flow rate of
1 mL/min.

Fluorescent and confocal microscopy
Fluorescent images of ALOS4-FITC were
acquired by Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera
mounted on an Olympus iX81 fluorescent microscope.
For confocal microscopy analysis the cells were
transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-fused
histone H1E (pH1E-GFP) [50] using Xfect polymer
(ST0152, Clontech Laboratories, CA, USA) and were
stained with CytoPainter Lysosomal Staining Kit - Red
Fluorescence (ab112137, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA). Images were collected with a Zeiss LSM700
confocal microscope.

Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry
(LCMS)
Electron spray mass spectra (ESI-MS) were
obtained using an Autoflex III smart-beam (MALDI,
Bruker), Q-TOF micro (Waters) or an LCQ FleetTM ion
trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan/Thermo). HPLC/LC-MS
analyses were made using Agilent infinity 1260 connected
to Agilent quadruple LC-MS 6120 series equipped with
ZORBAX SB-C18, 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm column. In all
cases the eluent solvents were A (0.1% TFA in H2O) and B
(0.1% TFA in ACN) and the elution gradient profile was:
100% A for first 4 min, 8 min (from min 4 to min 12)
during which it reached 100% B, 4 min (from min 12 to
min 16) of 100% B, 2 min (from min 16 to min 18) during
which it returned back to A, and 2 min (from min 18 to
min 20) of 100% A. The UV detection was at 254 nm.

Ex vivo fluorescent imaging
Five-week-old athymic nude mice (Harlan Labs,
Nes Ziona, Israel) were subcutaneously inoculated in
the dorsal left side with WM-266-4-cells, and tumors
allowed to establish over time. When tumor volume
reached 100 mm3, ALOS4-FITC (0.3 mg/kg ) was
intravenously administered. After 3 and 24 hours, the
delivery efficiency of ALOS4-FITC was assessed using

Western blot analysis
The cells were scraped and washed with PBS
buffer. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication in 1 X
SDS sample buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail (MBS539134, Millipore) and boiling for 10
min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The following
antibodies were used for western blotting: active caspase
3 (C8487, Sigma), γH2AX (05-636, Millipore) and
histone H3 (05-928, Millipore). The band intensities
in a representative experiment were quantified by the
ImageJ program.

Cell survival test
The cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined
by measuring the mitochondrial enzyme activity, using
a commercial XTT assay kit (#20-30-100, Biological
Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel) according to the
manufacturer protocol using 2x103 cells/well of a 96–
well plate. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in growth
medium followed by additional 48 hours with growth
medium supplemented with different concentrations of the
tested substances. The absorbance of the XTT reagent was
measured with a TECAN Infinite M200 ELISA reader.
The absorbencies were normalized to the absorbance of
cells grown in medium and solvent. All the tests were
repeated three times in quadruplicates.

The ALSO4 cyclic peptide (ligand) was docked to
integrin αvβ3 (receptor). During each docking simulation
the receptor remains stationary, while the ligand explores
all six degrees of freedom (three translations and three
rotations). The 3-dimentional structure of ALOS4 was
predicted computationally using the PEP-FOLD 1.5 server
[37]. The crystal structure of the extracellular segment of
integrin αvβ3 (Protein Data Bank entry 1JV2 [36]) was
used as the receptor. Simulations of unbiased (global)
docking between a peptide and the αvβ3 receptor to explore
all possible binding sites were performed using the Rosetta
software [35] while allowing side chains flexibility.
