Abstract
PED/PEA-15 (PED) is a death effector domain family member of 15 kDa with a broad antiapoptotic function
found overexpressed in a number of different human tumors, including lung cancer. To date, the mechanisms
that regulate PED expression are unknown. Therefore, we address this point by the identification of microRNAs that in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) modulate PED levels. In this work, we identify miR-212 as a
negative regulator of PED expression. We also show that ectopic expression of this miR increases tumor
necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced cell death in NSCLC cells. In contrast,
inhibition of endogenous miR-212 by use of antago-miR results in increase of PED protein expression and
resistance to TRAIL treatment. Besides, in NSCLC, we show both in vitro and in vivo that PED and miR-212
expressions are inversely correlated, that is, PED is upregulated and miR-212 is rarely expressed. In conclusion,
these findings suggest that miR-212 should be considered as a tumor suppressor because it negatively regulates the antiapoptotic protein PED and regulates TRAIL sensitivity. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3638–46. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancerrelated deaths worldwide. About 80% of all lung cancers
are of the non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) type,
which is divided in to three subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma (25–30%), adenocarcinoma (40%), and large-cell carcinoma (10–15%; ref. 1). Because of their resistance to therapeutic
drugs, standard treatment of these tumors has only a 20% to
30% positive clinical response. Therefore, to develop new
therapeutic strategies to improve therapy for NSCLC is
important in understanding the molecular mechanisms
involved in cell death resistance.
Apoptosis is the predominant mechanism by which cancer
cells die in response to cytotoxic drugs. Resistance to drug
treatment is due to deregulation of apoptosis-related proteins.
Among these proteins is PED/PEA-15, a death effector domain

(DED) family member of 15 kDa having a variety of effects on
cell growth and metabolism (2–4). PED/PEA-15 was found
overexpressed in a number of different human tumors, including gliomas, squamous carcinoma, thyroid, breast, lung cancer, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (5–9). PED/
PEA-15 has a broad antiapoptotic action, being able to inhibit
both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway is accomplished through its
DED, which likely acts as a competitive inhibitor for proapoptotic molecules during the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (3, 6). Recently, regulation of PED/PEA-15
phosphorylation by PTEN was shown to play a key role in determining whether a cell dies by type I or type II Fas-induced
apoptosis (10). We recently showed that in NSCLC, PED/
PEA-15 overexpression is responsible for a tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–resistant
phenotype (9). Furthermore, PED is upregulated in breast
cancer where it induces resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment (8, 9). To date, although PED/PEA-15 is overexpressed
in a number of different cancer types, the mechanisms that
regulate its expression are unknown.
An important mechanism of protein expression regulation
involves microRNAs (miRNA). These molecules are evolutionarily conserved, endogenous noncoding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides (nt) in length that function at the posttranscriptional
level (11). In animals, single-stranded miRNAs bind with specific mRNAs through sequences that are partially complementary to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA
(12). miRNAs are involved in numerous cellular processes including development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis,
and response to stress (13, 14). To date, more than 600 human
miRNAs have been experimentally identified and estimated to

MicroRNA and TRAIL Resistance

regulate more than one third of cellular mRNAs. Interestingly,
numerous oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are regulated by miRNAs. With the advent of miRNA expression profiling,
significant effort is being made to correlate miRNA expression
with tumor prognosis (15, 16). To date, a number of downregulated miRNAs found in lung cancer correlate with patient
survival (17, 18) and with therapeutic response (19).
In this article, we identify a miRNA that regulates PED/PEA15 expression. Our data indicate that miR-212 negatively modulates PED/PEA-15 expression and sensitizes non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we report that NSCLC-affected lung tissue overexpressing PED/PEA-15 protein has a concordant downregulation
of miR-212.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection. Calu-1 (NSCLC) cells were
grown in DMEM; H460 cells were grown in RPMI. Media
were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfection, cells at 50%
confluency were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 nmol/L (final) of pre-miR-212, pre-miR-34a,
pre-miR-124a, scrambled, or antisense miR-212 (Applied Biosystems). Transfections were done with Lipofectamine 2000
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Meg01 cells (human, chronic myelogenous leukemia cells)
were grown in RPMI 1640 + 2 mmol/L glutamine + 10% FBS.
Lung cancer samples. A total of 18 snap-frozen normal
and malignant lung tissues (12 men and 6 women; median
age, 70.0 y; range, 55–82 y) were collected at the Ohio State
University Medical Center (Columbus, OH).
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Cells were
washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in JS buffer [50
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl 2 , 5 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail].
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard, and
equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE
(12.5% acrylamide). Gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). For immunoblot experiments, membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat
dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated at
4°C overnight with primary antibody. Detection was done with
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the
enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham-Pharmacia
Biosciences). Primary antibodies used were anti-PED (3),
anti–caspase-8 (Cell Signaling), and anti–β-actin (Sigma).
Cell death quantification. Calu-1 cells were transfected
with pre-miR-212 or control for 48 h. Cells were then trypsinized, plated in 96-well plates in triplicate, and further incubated with 10 or 25 ng/mL superkiller TRAIL (Alexisis
Biochemicals) for 24 h. Cell viability was evaluated with the
CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay
(Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Metabolically active cells were detected by adding 20 μL of MTS

www.aacrjournals.org

to each well. After 2 h of incubation, the plates were analyzed
in a Multilabel Counter (BioTek).
Cell death assessment by Annexin V staining. Calu1 cells
were transfected with 100 nmol/L miR scrambled and with
100 nmol/L miR-212. After 48 h, cells were treated with 10 or
25 ng/mL of TRAIL for 24 h, harvested, washed twice with
cold PBS, and stained with Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit 1 (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, cells were resuspended
in 100 μL of 1× binding buffer and 5 μL of Annexin V and
then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Apoptotic
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR. Total RNAs (miRNA
and mRNA) were extracted using miRNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse
transcription of total miRNA and mRNA was done starting
from equal amounts of total RNA/sample (1 μg) using miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). For cultured cells,
quantitative analyses of PED, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (as an internal reference), miR-212, and
RNU5A (as an internal reference) were done by real-time
PCR using specific primers (Qiagen), miScript SYBR Green
PCR Kit (Qiagen), and QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit
(Qiagen), respectively. The reaction for detection of mRNAs
was done as follows: 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94°C for
15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The reaction for detection of miRNAs was done as follows: 95°C for 15 min, 40
cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 70°C for 30 s. To
analyze PED and miR-212 expression in lung tissue specimens (neoplastic and normal tissue), real-time PCR was
done using a standard TaqMan PCR Kit protocol on an
Applied Biosystems7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). The reactions were incubated at
95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s
and 60°C for 1 min.
All reactions were run in triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT)
is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. For relative quantitation,
the 2(−ΔCT) method was used as previously described (20). Experiments were carried out in triplicate for each data point,
and data analysis was done by using Bio-Rad IQ software.
Luciferase assay. The 3′UTR of the human PED gene was
PCR amplified using the PED primers 5′-tctagaaaggcaaagagaccactcaaccccca-3′ (forward) and 5′-tctagaatgttcttcaccaaggagagagggaaggtt-3′ (reverse) and cloned downstream of the
Renilla luciferase stop codon in pGL3 control vector (Promega), giving rise to pcDNA/PED-clone1 (3). This construct was
used to generate, by inverse PCR, the p3′-UTRmut-PED plasmid (primers: PED-mut1, FW 5′-tgtttgtactcctgtgctgtcctgagtaccagc-3′, RW 5′-gctggtactcaggacagcacaggagtacaaaca-3′;
PED-mut2, FW 5′-agttgttcctactcagcactctaaacctagggagg-3′,
RW 5′-cctccctaggtttagagtgctgagtaggaacaact-3′). MeG01 cells
were cotransfected with 1 μg of p3′UTR-PED and with p3′
UTRmut-PED plasmid and 1 μg of the Renilla luciferase expression construct pRL-TK (Promega) with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h posttransfection
and assayed with Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Three independent
experiments were done in triplicate.

on the chromogen nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate. Negative controls included the use of a probe,
which should yield a negative result in such tissues. No counterstain was used to facilitate colabeling for PED protein. After
in situ hybridization for the miRNAs, as previously described
(21), the slides were analyzed for immunohistochemistry using
the optimal conditions for PED (1:800, cell conditioning for 30
min). For the immunohistochemistry, we used the Ultrasensitive Universal Fast Red system from Ventana Medical Systems.
We used normal lung tissues as controls for these proteins.
The percentage of tumor cells expressing PED and miR-212
was then analyzed with emphasis on colocalization of the
respective targets (miR-212 and either PED).

Results
Identification of miRNA involved in PED regulation. To
identify miRNAs that specifically target PED (PED/PEA-15),
we used bioinformatic analyses available on the web, including Pictar, TargetScan, miRanda, and miRBase. Comparing
the results obtained from the different searches, we found
that miR-34a, miR-124a, and miR-212 consistently showed
the highest score of probability for targeting PED 3′UTR.
PED 3′UTR contains two potential binding sites for miR212 at nt 507 and nt 741, one for miR-34a at nt 1142, and
two for miR-124a at nt 1491 and nt 1527 (Fig. 1A, top).
To asses whether exogenous expression of the selected
miRNAs induced PED downregulation, we used Calu-1 cells,

miRNAs) was extracted from Calu-1 and H460 cells and 1 μg was

which express high PED levels (9). To this end, Calu-1 cells
were transiently transfected with 100 nmol/L of the indicated
pre-miRNAs for 72 hours, and PED expression levels then
identified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, bottom).
As shown, miR-212 induced the greatest decrease in PED
protein.
The most widely used approach for experimentally validating miRNA targets is to clone the predicted miRNA-binding
sequence downstream of a luciferase reporter construct and
to cotransfect it with the miRNA of interest. To this end, we
cloned the 3′UTR sequence of human PED into the luciferase
expressing vector pGL3-control downstream of the luciferase
stop codon; Meg01 cell lines were transiently transfected
with this construct in the presence of pre-miR-212 or a
scrambled oligonucleotide acting as a negative control. As
reported in Fig. 1B, miR-212 significantly reduced luciferase
activity compared with the scrambled oligonucleotide. This
indicates that miR-212 binds to the 3′UTR of Ped and impairs
PED mRNA translation.
As reported above, miR-212 targets two regions of the 3′
UTR of PED mRNA (Fig. 1A). To determine which of the
two regions is implicated in the binding with miR-212, we
generated two deletion mutants (Fig. 1C, left): mut1, lacking
the first binding site, GACTGTT (top); and mut2, lacking the
second binding site, AGACTGTT (bottom). The two mutants
were cloned into the 3′UTR of the luciferase gene and cotransfected with pre-miR-212 into the Meg01 cell line. As
shown in Fig. 1C (right), miR-212 did not significantly reduce
luciferase activity in the presence of the mut2 sequence. This
result indicates that miR-212 targets PED mRNA at the
AGACUGUU sequence.
miR-212 modulates PED mRNA levels. To asses whether
PED upregulation in lung cancer cells was due to decreasing
expression of miR-212, we analyzed in Calu-1 and H460 cells,
expressing different amounts of PED protein (Fig. 2A), the
levels of miR-212 and PED mRNA by real-time PCR. As
shown in Fig. 2B and C, an inverse correlation between
PED mRNA and miR-212 levels was found.
It is known that miRNAs regulate gene expression either
by direct cleavage of the targeted mRNAs or by inhibiting
translation (22). To determine whether the binding of miR212 to PED 3′UTR results in mRNA degradation, Calu-1 cells
were transfected for 48 or 72 hours with pre-miR-212, and
PED expression was then evaluated by real-time PCR and
Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3A, exogenous expression of
miR-212 induced a marked reduction of PED mRNA (top) as
well as PED protein (middle) levels. The efficiency of miR-212
transfection was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR; bottom). Next, to assess whether miR-212 plays a physiologic role in controlling PED expression, we treated H460
cells, which express high levels of miR-212, with a specific
antago-miR-212. As shown in Fig. 3B, increased expression
of PED mRNA (top) and PED protein (middle) was evident
already at 48 hours of antago-miRNA transfection. The efficiency of antago-miR-212 transfection was evaluated by RTPCR of the endogenous miRNA (bottom). Taken together, the
results show that in lung cancer cells, PED and miR-212 expressions are inversely correlated and that miR-212 regulates
PED expression.

miR-212 and PED mRNA levels in NSCLC tissue. To evaluate whether PED upregulation in lung cancer is related to
decreased miR-212 levels also in vivo, we analyzed PED and
miR-212 expression levels in tissue specimens collected from
18 patients (14 NSCLC-affected individuals and 4 with normal lung tissue). As shown in Fig. 4, in normal lung samples,
the levels of miR-212 were high whereas PED was expressed
at low levels. On the contrary, in the majority of lung cancer
samples, miR-212 was expressed at low levels and PED was
overexpressed.
To corroborate these findings, in situ hybridization analysis was done, using 5′-dig-labeled LNA probes, on NSCLC and
normal lung tissues, followed by immunohistochemistry for
PED (Fig. 5). MiR-212 and PED expressions were inversely related in NSCLC and the adjacent normal lung tissues. Lung
cancer cells showed high expression of PED and rarely expressed miR-212 (Fig. 5A–C), whereas the adjacent nonmalignant lung expressed miR-212 abundantly and rarely showed
detectable PED signal (Fig. 5A–C). Costaining of PED and
miR-212 showed that the two labelings did not overlap

(Fig. 5C-c), showing that PED and miR-212 were not expressed
in the same cell. In situ hybridization was done for 110 samples. The majority of cancer cells were positive for PED (84%).
Seventy-three percent of the samples were negative for miR212. When we analyzed for double staining, we found that
60% (65 of 110 patients) of the cells were PED positive/miR212 negative (PED+ /miR− ), 24% (26 of 110 patients) were
PED+/miR+, 3.6% (4 of 110 patients) were PED−/miR+, and
13% (15 of 110 patients) were PED−/miR−. These results further
support our above finding that the upregulation of PED in
lung cancer is dependent on decreased miR-212 levels.
MiR-212 increases TRAIL-induced cell death in NSCLC
cells. We have previously shown that a TRAIL-resistant phenotype in NSCLC is related to overexpression of PED (9). The observation that miR-212 targets PED suggests that ectopic
expression of this miRNA should increase sensitivity to TRAIL.
To this aim, we transfected Calu-1 cells with pre-miR-212, and
caspase-8 activation was then evaluated following treatment
with TRAIL (Fig. 6A). As shown, PED expression decreased in
the presence of exogenous miR-212, and caspase-8 activation

was extracted and 1 μg was reverse transcribed and amplified as described in Materials and Methods. As shown, PED mRNA was downregulated by
miR-212 transfection. Middle, cell lysates from Calu-1 cells were collected after 48 and 72 h from pre-miR-212 or scrb transfections and immunoblotted with
anti-PED antibody. To confirm equal loading, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti–β-actin antibody. As shown, decreasing amount of PED protein
was evident in the presence of exogenous pre-miR-212 (bottom). Relative expression of ectopic miR-212 after the transfection was evaluated. B, top,
H460 cells were transfected for 48 and 72 h with antago-miR-212 (anti-212) or scrb. After transfection, total RNA was extracted and 1 μg was reverse
transcribed and amplified as described in Materials and Methods. As shown, an increasing amount of PED mRNA was evident in the presence of exogenous
anti-212 (middle). Cell lysates from H460 cells were collected after 48 and 72 h from anti-212 or scrb transfections and immunoblotted with anti-PED
antibody. To confirm equal loading, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti–β-actin antibody. As shown, an increasing amount of PED protein was evident
in the presence of exogenous anti-212 (bottom). Relative expression of endogenous miR-212 after the antago-miR-212 transfection was evaluated.

was evident 2 hours after TRAIL treatment (compare lane 5
with lane 6 and lane 7 with lane 8). To further confirm this result, we analyzed TRAIL-induced cell death in the presence of
exogenous pre-miR-212 with a cell viability assay (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and Annexin V apoptosis assay (Fig. 6B and
Supplementary Fig. S1B for representative dot blot). By time
course and dose/response analysis (data not shown), we found
that to better appreciate a difference in cell viability, low concentrations of TRAIL were needed. To this end, Calu-1 cells
were transfected for 48 hours with pre-miR-212, then stimulated with 10 and 25 ng/mL of TRAIL for 24 hours, and cell death
was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6B, transfection of miR-212 increased TRAIL-induced cell death up to 3-fold that of Calu-1
cells. Thus, PED downregulation induced by miR-212 increases
sensitivity to TRAIL in lung cancer cells.
To further evaluate the role of miR-212 in apoptosis sensitivity, TRAIL-sensitive H460 cells were transfected with antagomiR-212 to decrease endogenous miR-212 and then
analyzed for their susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death.
As shown in Fig. 6C, antago-miR treatment increased PED
protein and rendered H460 cells more resistant to TRAIL.
To confirm that PED is an important target of miR-212 for
regulation of apoptosis, Calu-1 cells were transfected with
pre-miR-212 in the presence or in the absence of PED-myc

www.aacrjournals.org

cDNA that lacks 3′UTR. As shown in Fig. 6D, ectopic expression of miR-212 and PED-myc cDNA restores the apoptotic
resistance, assessed as caspase-8 activation. To confirm this
result, we analyzed TRAIL-induced cell death in the presence
of exogenous pre-miR-212 and PED-myc with a cell viability
assay, obtaining the same results (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Taken together, these results indicate that miR-212 increases
TRAIL sensitivity by targeting the antiapoptotic protein PED.

Discussion
The resistance of tumors to current chemotherapeutic
protocols remains a major problem in cancer therapy. Defects in the apoptotic program may contribute to treatment
resistance and tumor progression and may be caused by deregulated expression of antiapoptotic molecules. Better
knowledge of tumor biology is providing the opportunity to
treat lung cancer with a new class of anticancer drugs. PED is
overexpressed in lung cancer, as well as in other human tumors including gliomas, squamous carcinoma, breast cancer,
and thyroid cancer, and its overexpression is related to resistance to chemotherapy and TRAIL-induced cell death (4–9).
Furthermore, we recently showed that PED is upregulated
and induces resistance to TRAIL in NSCLC (9). Even so, the

molecular mechanisms of deregulation of PED expression in
cancer cells are still unknown. We therefore have set out to
identify possible miRNAs able to regulate PED expression in
human lung cancer.
Here, we found that in lung cancer cells, miR-212 was able
to target PED 3′UTR and decrease its levels, thus suggesting
that by maintaining PED levels low, miR-212 action may contribute to tumor suppression.
Over the past few years, several miRs have been implicated
in various human cancers. Both losses and gains of miR function have been shown to contribute to cancer development
through a range of mechanisms (23, 24).
More often in various human tumors has been observed
an overexpression of miRs, and several of these miRs function as oncogenes. When downregulated, miRNAs are considered tumor suppressor because they usually prevent tumor
development by negatively inhibiting molecules involved in
apoptosis resistance.
Different studies show that lung adenocarcinoma has a
miR expression signature that greatly adapts to the use of
clinical data in predicting an individual's survival. Low expression of let-7a and high expression of miR-155 are linked
to unfavorable clinical outcome in lung cancer (17). The miR34 cluster (miR-34a, miR-34b, miR-34c) is repressed in cancers and miR-34c is involved in p53 tumor suppression in
many cancers, including lung cancer (25, 26). Bandi et al.
(27) identified miR-15a and miR-16 as frequently deleted in

NSCLC, implying an increase of cell cycle. Furthermore, Nasser et al. (28) showed that miR-1 was downregulated in lung
cancer and was related to increased migration and motility
of lung cancer cells.
Using real-time RT-PCR, Yu et al. (29) analyzed miR expression in 112 different NSCLC patients. They found that
two miRs acted as antitumoral genes (miR-221 and let-7a)
and three miRs were risky for NSCLC (miR-137, miR-372,
and miR-182). Liu et al. (30) found that miR-34c, miR-145,
and miR-142-5p were suppressed in transgenic lung cancers
as well as human normal versus malignant lung tissues.
MiR-212 expression levels in human cancer have not been
extensively investigated thus far. Recently, miR-212 downregulation has been found to be involved in lung cancer response to chemotherapy, in particular to docetaxel (31).
The molecular targets responsible to this resistance have
not been identified thus far, but it would be interesting to
speculate that PED may participate in this process.
Our data show that in sample specimens from lung cancer,
miR-212 expression is low compared with normal samples.
Interestingly, miR-212 expression inversely correlates with
PED expression and with response to TRAIL treatment.
Therefore, miR-212 expression could predict therapeutic response to TRAIL in lung cancer.
The mechanisms of miR-212 downregulation in human
cancer are not clear at the moment. miR-212 is located on
human chromosome 17, in a region that is frequently lost

Figure 5. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of lung carcinoma and normal tissue samples. MiR-212 (blue; A-a) and PED (red; B-b) expressions
were inversely related in lung cancer and the adjacent normal lung tissues (C-c shows colocalization expression of PED and miR-212). Top, PED (B) and
miR-212 (A) expressions were confined mostly to cancer cells. However, note that cancer cells express PED and do not express miR-212 and vice versa (C).
Bottom, a nest of cancer cells expressing only miR-212 (a). Note that PED expression (b) is confined to the benign stromal cells that are found in the
desmoplastic tissue surrounding the cancer cells nest. Bar, 25 μm. The magnification is the same for all images. D-d, H&E. One hundred ten lung carcinoma and
normal samples were analyzed. As described in the text, the majority of cancer cells were positive for PED and negative for miR-212. In the cases of lung
carcinoma where both miR-212 and PED expressions were noted, cancer cells expressing PED were distinct from those expressing miR-212.

MicroRNA and TRAIL Resistance

Figure 6. miR-212 transfection induces TRAIL sensitivity. A, Calu-1 cells were transfected either with pre-miR-212 or with scrb. After 72 h, cells were treated
with 200 ng/mL Super-Killer TRAIL for the indicated times. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti–caspase-8 and anti-PED antibodies.
Cleavage of caspase-8 was more evident in Calu-1 cells transfected with miR-212 compared with scrb. β-Actin antibody was used as loading control.
B, Calu-1 cells were transfected either with pre-miR-212 or with scrb for 48 h. Then, the cells were incubated with 10 or 25 ng/mL of Super-Killer
TRAIL for 24 h. Apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V staining. Columns, mean of four independent experiments in triplicate; bars, SD. Downregulation of
PED by miR-212 was responsible for increased sensitivity of Calu-1 cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death. C, H460 cells were transfected either with
anti-212 or with scrb for 48 h, then the cells were incubated with 25 ng/mL Super-Killer TRAIL for 24 h. Top, upregulation of PED expression after
antago-miR transfection was evaluated by Western blotting using anti-PED antibody. β-Actin antibody was used as loading control. Bottom, cell viability
was evaluated by CellTiter Assay. Columns, mean of four independent experiments in triplicate; bars, SD. D, Calu-1 cells were transfected with
miR-212 in the presence or absence of PED-myc recombinant protein. After 72 h, cells were treated with 200 ng/mL Super-Killer TRAIL for 3 h and
caspase-8 activation was analyzed by Western blotting with anti–caspase-8 antibodies. Cleavage of caspase-8 was more evident in Calu-1 cells
transfected with miR-212 in the absence of PED-myc recombinant protein. Expressions of PED-myc (18 kDa) and endogenous PED (15 kDa) were evaluated
with anti-PED antibody. β-Actin antibody was used as loading control.

in different human cancers (32), and this may represent a
mechanism to explain its low expression.
The silencing of miR in cancer can be caused not only by
deletions and mutations but also by epigenetic changes.
Altered patterns of epigenetic modifications, in particular
the methylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions
of some miRs, have been described (33). The miR-212 promoter region is possibly rich in CpG islands. Experiments
are under way in our lab to clarify whether methylation
may be a mechanism involved in the regulation of miR212 expression levels.
In summary, miRs are potential antineoplasitc agents. Perhaps combination therapy with different miRs will be needed
to confer desired antitumorigenic effects. It will be critical to

discern which miRs are overexpressed in lung cancer and
which need to be inactivated to inhibit lung carcinogenesis.
Conceivably, these miRs or their derivates would become
agents to treat or chemoprevent lung cancer.
