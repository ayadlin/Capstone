ABSTRACT
Chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-napthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311)
and di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) target tumor
cell iron pools and inhibit proliferation. These agents also modulate multiple targets,
one of which is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. Hence, this investigation
examined the mechanism of action of these compounds in targeting p21. All the
chelators up-regulated p21 mRNA in the five tumor cell-types assessed. In contrast,
examining their effect on total p21 protein levels, these agents induced either:
(1) down-regulation in MCF-7 cells; (2) up-regulation in SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1
cells; or (3) had no effect in LNCaP and SK-N-MC cells. The nuclear localization of p21
was also differentially affected by the ligands depending upon the cell-type, with it
being decreased in MCF-7 cells, but increased in SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells. Further
studies assessing the mechanisms responsible for these effects demonstrated that
p21 expression was not correlated with p53 status, suggesting a p53-independent
mechanism. Considering this, we examined proteins that modulate p21 independently
of p53, namely NDRG1, MDM2 and ∆Np63. These studies demonstrated that a
dominant negative MDM2 isoform (p75MDM2) closely resembled p21 expression in
response to chelation in three cell lines. These data suggest MDM2 may be involved
in the regulation of p21 by chelators.

Desferrioxamine (DFO; Fig. 1) is a well known
Fe chelator that is clinically used for the treatment of the
Fe overload disease, β-thalassemia [15]. The potential of
chelators as anti-cancer agents was realised when DFO
was trialled in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies,
some of which showed promising results [1, 4, 5, 17].
Although DFO has shown anti-proliferative activity, the
high hydrophilicity of this ligand limits its membrane
permeability and anti-tumor efficacy [18, 19]. As a result
of this problem and its short half-life in the circulation,
DFO must be administered via subcutaneous infusion for
extensive periods, making it inconvenient for patients [15].
Due to the limitations of DFO, alternative chelators
have been developed in the quest to create more potent
and selective anti-cancer agents [15]. For example,

INTRODUCTION
Iron (Fe) deprivation via the use of chelators, has
been shown to lead to G1/S arrest in neoplastic cells [1–7].
In fact, cellular Fe levels modulate the expression of
molecules involved in cell cycle control, including cyclins,
cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk), cdk inhibitors, as well as
tumor suppressor and metastasis suppressor genes [8–12].
Since neoplastic cells have a greater need for Fe, they
are more susceptible to the effects of Fe chelation when
compared to normal cells [13, 14]. Thus, by inhibiting
Fe availability to tumors, cancer cell proliferation can be
effectively blocked, indicating that targeting Fe and other
essential metals is a significant new therapeutic strategy
[9, 15, 16].

2-hydroxy-1-napthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone
(311; Fig. 1), is a ligand of the pyridoxal isonicotinoyl
hydrazone (PIH) class that has been shown to be more
effective at chelating cellular Fe than DFO, and this can be
explained by its greater lipophilicity [20–22]. Furthermore,
di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone
(Dp44mT; Fig. 1), is a novel agent from the dipyridyl
thiosemicarbazones (DpT) class of chelators that has been
demonstrated to have markedly greater anti-proliferative
activity and Fe chelation efficacy than DFO and is highly
effective at reducing growth and metastasis of multiple
tumors in vitro and in vivo [23–26]. An important aspect
of the activity of the DpT class of thiosemicarbazones
(e.g., Dp44mT) is their ability to: (1) up-regulate the
potent metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream
regulated gene-1 (NDRG1) [12, 25], which inhibits the
epithelial mesenchymal transition [27] through its effect
on a number of oncogenic signaling pathways [14, 27–31];
and (2) their ability to overcome multi-drug resistance [24]
by causing lysosomal membrane permeabilization via their
metal-induced redox activity [32, 33]. In fact, the DpT
series of ligands form redox-active complexes with Fe and
copper, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) that enhance cellular toxicity [33–35].
In order to develop these agents further, and
to better understand their mechanisms of action, the
effects of chelators on the expression of cell cycle
control molecules require further elucidation. In fact,
apart from up-regulating NDRG1, chelators were
found to affect a number of crucial molecules that are
involved in proliferation and apoptosis [36]. Among
these, cellular Fe chelation up-regulates the expression

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor,
p53 [10, 37]. Additionally, Fe depletion increased p53
phosphorylation, which stabilizes the p53 protein,
preventing its proteasomal degradation [38]. Notably,
p53 plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes
involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to
genotoxic damage or cellular stress [39].
Thus, NDRG1 and p53 are important molecular
targets of chelators, which are crucial to the anti-cancer
and anti-metastatic activity of these agents [10, 12, 16].
These molecules and their downstream protein targets
present ideal therapeutic strategies for the treatment
of cancer. In fact, the cdk inhibitor, p21, is a common
downstream target for both p53 [40] and NDRG1 [41]
and plays an important role in the inhibition of cell
cycle progression and proliferation [42, 43], as well as
prevention of metastasis [44].
Significantly, p21 plays a variety of physiological
roles, many of which rely on its nuclear localization [45].
These include its cdk inhibitory function, promotion
of differentiation and of cellular senescence [45]. For
instance, p21 inhibits the cyclin D/cdk4/6 and the cyclin
E/cdk2 complexes in response to DNA-damage, resulting
in G1/S arrest [46]. In addition, p21 also binds to the
DNA replication/repair factor, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), interfering with its DNA replication,
but not DNA repair activity [47, 48]. Paradoxically, when
localized (at least initially) to the cytosol, p21 can aid cell
cycle progression and play vital pro-proliferative and cell
survival roles [45]. At low levels, p21 can aid cell cycle
progression, by stabilizing interactions between cdk4/6 and
cyclin D1 [49, 50]. Notably, p21 also has anti-apoptotic

functions when up-regulated in tumor cells [51].
Considering its crucial role [46, 49], it is vital to elucidate
how p21 responds to Fe-depletion in various cancer cells
and whether it can be utilized as a therapeutic target.
The current study investigated the mechanisms
involved in the chelator-mediated regulation of p21. Five
cancer cell lines with different p53 status were incubated
with either of three ligands, namely: DFO, 311 or Dp44mT.
In addition, the well characterized DNA-damaging agents:
actinomycin D (Act D), cisplatin (CP) and mitomycin C
(MC) [52–55], were also used throughout this study as
positive controls. Hence, for the first time, the effect of a
variety of effective chelators could be assessed relative to
a range of DNA-damaging agents to assess the mechanism
involved. These results revealed a number of significant
outcomes, namely: (1) the effect of the chelators on p21
differed between the cell-types examined, with p21 protein
being up-regulated in SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells,
down-regulated in MCF-7 cells, and left unchanged in
LNCaP and SK-N-MC cells; (2) the nuclear localization
of p21 was also differentially affected by the ligands
depending upon the cell-type, with it being decreased in
MCF-7 cells, but increased in SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1
cells; (3) the p53 status of the cells examined showed
no correlation to the chelator-mediated effects on p21,
suggesting a p53-independent effect; and (4) examination
of molecules that can modulate p21 independently of p53,
namely NDRG1 [41], mouse double minute 2 homolog
(MDM2) [56, 57] and ∆Np63 [58–61], revealed that a
dominant negative MDM2 isoform (p75MDM2) closely
resembled p21 expression in response to chelation in three
of the five cell lines examined. In fact, the p75MDM2 isoform
has been shown to interfere with the ability of the fulllength MDM2 (p90MDM2) to degrade its target proteins [62],
which include p53 and p21 [56, 57, 63, 64]. These data
suggest that MDM2 may be one effector through which
chelators regulate p21 expression in these cell-types.

expression could correlate to p53 status and activity in the
cells examined.
In these studies, a 24 h incubation with the
chelators, 311 (25 μM), Dp44mT (2.5 μM) and DFO
(250 μM) was utilized. These concentrations were used
due to the relative permeability and efficacy of these
ligands. Indeed, DFO is highly hydrophilic and does not
permeate cell membranes effectively [19], while 311 and
Dp44mT are both lipophilic and easily permeate cell
membranes to chelate intracellular Fe pools [21, 23]. A
lower concentration of Dp44mT was used relative to 311
due to the markedly greater anti-proliferative activity of
the former compound [21, 23]. These concentrations also
allowed comparisons to the results obtained in previous
studies using these agents [14, 70]. After all incubations at
these concentrations, the cell monolayer remained intact
and the cells were viable.
Using these experimental conditions with the
chelators, a significant (p < 0.001–0.05) up-regulation
in p21 mRNA levels was observed across all cell-types
examined when compared to untreated control cells (Fig.
2A–2E). The DNA-damaging agents, Act D (5 nM),
CP (20 μM) and MC (30 μM), were used as positive
controls, as these conditions are known to markedly upregulate p21 mRNA in MCF-7 cells [12]. Following a
24 h incubation, both CP and MC significantly (p < 0.01–
0.05) up-regulated p21 mRNA levels in each of the celltypes examined (Fig. 2A–2E). In contrast, while Act D
increased p21 mRNA relative to the control, the effect was
variable between cell-types, with no marked up-regulation
occurring for SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 2C) and CFPAC-1
(Fig. 2D). On the other hand, a marked and significant
(p < 0.01) up-regulation of p21 mRNA occurred when
MCF-7, LNCaP and SK-N-MC cells were treated with
Act D relative to the control (Fig. 2A, 2B, 2E).
A well characterised molecular target of Fe
depletion, namely NDRG1 [12, 25], was also used as
a positive control for Fe-mediated regulation by the
chelators. As shown in Fig. 2A–2E, in all five cell-types
the chelators resulted in a significant (p < 0.01–0.05)
increase in NDRG1 mRNA levels relative to the control,
which is in agreement with earlier studies [12]. The DNAdamaging agents displayed no significant (p > 0.05) effects
on NDRG1 expression in these cell lines.
In summary, in each of the cell lines examined, the
chelators were able to markedly up-regulate p21 mRNA
levels, regardless of the p53 status of the cell (Table 1).
These results suggest that the chelators may regulate
p21 mRNA independently of p53 status.

RESULTS
Incubation with chelators or DNA-damaging
agents up-regulates p21 mRNA expression
To examine the effect of chelators on p21
expression, our initial studies focused on examining
p21 mRNA levels in five different cell-types, namely:
MCF-7, LNCaP, SK-MEL-28, CFPAC-1 and SK-N-MC
cells (Fig. 2A–2E). These cell lines were specifically
chosen due to their varying p53 status (Table 1), with
MCF-7 and LNCaP cells expressing wild-type (WT)
p53, while SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells express
mutant p53, and SK-N-MC cells are p53 null [65–69].
Considering that p53 is an important transcriptional
activator of p21 [39], we initially hypothesised that p21

agents, Act D (5 nM), CP (20 μM), or MC (30 μM). The gels are typical of 3 independent experiments, while the densitometric analysis is

cells, the protein levels of p21 were markedly reduced by
these agents. To further investigate this, the next series of
studies focused on examining the protein levels of p21 in
all five cell lines. Under control conditions, MCF-7 cells
expressed relatively high levels of p21 protein (Fig. 3A).
In agreement with previous findings [70, 71], the protein
levels of p21 were significantly (p < 0.01–0.05) decreased
by the chelators in this cell line, when compared to the
control (Fig. 3A). This effect was in contrast to the
up-regulation of p21 mRNA levels that was observed after
incubation of MCF-7 cells with these agents relative to
control medium (Fig. 2A). However, the DNA-damaging
agents, Act D and CP, significantly (p < 0.01–0.05)
increased the levels of p21 protein in MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 3A), which was in agreement with their effect on
p21 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). The effect of Act D
and CP on increasing p21 protein was expected based on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the fact that MCF-7 cells express wild-type p53 which
responds to DNA damage [39] (Table 1). However,
unexpectedly, treatment of MCF-7 cells with the DNAdamaging agent, MC, resulted in a significant (p < 0.01)
decrease in p21 protein expression relative to the control
(Fig. 3A).
In contrast to MCF-7 cells, incubation of LNCaP
cells with 311, Dp44mT, or DFO, failed to significantly
(p > 0.05) alter p21 protein levels relative to the control
(Fig. 3B). However, incubating LNCaP cells with
the DNA-damaging agents, Act D, CP, or MC, also
resulted in a marked and significant (p < 0.001–0.05)
increase in p21 levels relative to the control (Fig. 3B).
Considering that LNCaP cells also express wild-type
p53 (Table 1; [65]), the observed effect of DNAdamaging agents on the up-regulation of p21 expression
was expected.

Oncotarget

In contrast to MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, using
SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells, chelators markedly
(p < 0.001–0.01) increased p21 levels in comparison to
the untreated controls (Fig. 3C, 3D). However, relative to
the control, there were no significant (p > 0.05) alterations
in p21 protein levels following incubation with the DNAdamaging agents in both these cell lines, and this could
be due to the fact that they possess mutated p53 [66, 68].
Clearly, this response to chelation and DNA-damaging
agents by SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 3C) and CFPAC-1 cells
(Fig. 3D) is different to that observed for MCF-7 and
LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A).
Examining SK-N-MC cells, p21 was markedly
expressed in untreated control cells (Fig. 3E). Following
incubation with 311 or Dp44mT, there was a slight, but
not significant (p > 0.05) decrease in p21 protein levels
in comparison to control cells, while DFO exerted no
significant effect (Fig. 3E). In addition, incubation with
DNA-damaging agents resulted in no significant (p > 0.05)
change in p21 protein expression relative to the control in
SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 3E), which was expected considering
that these cells are p53 null [69]. In contrast to the results
with the other cell-types, the results in terms of p21 protein
expression obtained with SK-N-MC cells varied between
investigations. For instance, during the current study,
incubation with chelators resulted in a consistently slight,
but not significant (p > 0.05) decrease in p21 expression
in SK-N-MC cells over 6 experiments (Fig. 3E). On the
other hand, several previous investigations reported a
slight increase of p21 protein relative to the control [9], or
significant up-regulation [72]. This variability in response

of p21 to the agents was only observed for SK-N-MC cells
and may be related to clonal differences in tumor cell lines
that occur as a function of passage number [73].
Considering that the metastasis suppressor
NDRG1 was found to up-regulate p21 expression in a
wide variety of cancer cells [41], we further examined
the levels of NDRG1 in response to the Fe chelators
and DNA damaging agents in each of the five cell lines.
As previously reported [25], two NDRG1 bands at
43- and 44-kDa were detected in all cell lines examined
(Fig. 3A–3E). These bands may correspond to different
post-translational modifications e.g., truncation and
phosphorylation states of NDRG1 [74, 75]. Hence, the
densitometric analysis performed for NDRG1 herein
represents the sum of the two bands. As shown in
Fig.  3A–3D, NDRG1 protein levels were significantly
(p < 0.01–0.05) increased in MCF-7, LNCaP, SK-MEL-28
and CFPAC-1 cells after incubation with the chelators. A
slight, but not significant (p > 0.05) increase in NDRG1
was also observed in SK-N-MC cells following incubation
with these ligands. However, only in SK-MEL-28
(Fig. 3C) and CFPAC-1 cells (Fig. 3D) did the expression
of NDRG1 directly correlate with increased p21 levels
after incubation with these latter agents. No significant
(p > 0.05) alterations in the expression of NDRG1 protein
levels were detected after incubation with the DNAdamaging agents relative to the control in all cell-types
(Fig. 3A–3E).
Since p53 plays an important role in sensing both
nutrient-depletion and DNA-damage [11, 76, 77], and can
directly influence p21 expression [40], the difference in the

The expression of the MDM2 oncoprotein in
response to chelators may affect expression of p21

response of p21 protein expression to chelators and DNAdamaging agents was hypothesized to be due to differences
in p53 status between the cell-types (Table 1). However,
collectively, assessing all cell-types examined, increased
p21 mRNA and protein expression after incubation with
chelators was not positively correlated to WT p53 status
(Table 1). This conclusion is clear when comparing the
effect of chelators on MCF-7 cells and SK-MEL-28 cells
(Fig. 3A, 3C). In fact, MCF-7 cells have WT p53 and
demonstrated a decrease in p21 protein after incubation
with chelators (Fig. 3A; Table 1), while SK-MEL-28 cells
are p53 mutant and showed a marked increase in p21
protein after treatment with these agents (Fig. 3C; Table 1).
It should be noted that the three chelators used in
this investigation increased p21 mRNA levels in all celltypes examined (Fig. 2A–2E). In contrast, the protein
levels were significantly (p < 0.01–0.05) decreased by
these agents in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). These observations
suggest that p21 translation may be inhibited, or
alternatively, there may be increased p21 protein
degradation in this cell-type. Indeed, inhibition of protein
synthesis is known to occur after incubation of cells with
chelators, including DFO and 311 [21].

As p53 status between the cell-types examined did
not satisfactorily explain the different p21 response to the
chelators, further studies were performed to determine the
molecular mechanisms involved. Considering this, studies
then assessed MDM2, which functions as an oncoprotein
and a negative regulator of both p53 and p21 [56, 57, 63,
64]. Interestingly, MDM2 has also been shown to promote
p21 protein degradation independently of its effects on p53
[56, 57]. Hence, the following investigation focused on the
effect of the agents on MDM2 expression (Fig. 4A–3D).
Numerous isoforms of MDM2 are known to exist (i.e.,
full-length p90MDM2, p75MDM2, p60MDM2, p50MDM2, etc.), each
having various effects on its downstream targets [78, 79].
Two particular isoforms, namely p90MDM2 and p75MDM2,
have been reported to predominate in both human and
murine cells [80, 81]. The over-expression of p75MDM2,
which cannot bind to p53, has been found to interfere
with the ability of p90MDM2 to promote p53 degradation
[62]. Hence, the effects of the agents on these two latter
isoforms were particularly important to assess.

First, it is important to note that despite exhaustive
attempts, western blot analysis revealed that of the five
cell-types used, MDM2 isoforms were not detected in
CFPAC-1 cells. This was in direct contrast to the other cell
lines examined, and hence, only MDM2 blots for MCF-7
(Fig. 4A), LNCaP (Fig. 4B), SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 4C) and
SK-N-MC cells (Fig. 4D) are shown. After incubation of
MCF-7 cells with chelators, the expression of multiple
isoforms of MDM2 was slightly, but not significantly
(p > 0.05) decreased in comparison to the control cells.
These included the p50MDM2, p60MDM2 and p90MDM2
isoforms (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, incubation of these
cells with Dp44mT demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05)
decrease in the expression of the p75MDM2 isoform. In
contrast, incubation with Act D or CP resulted in a
significant (p < 0.01–0.05) increase in the expression of
the p75MDM2 isoform (Fig. 4A). However, MC significantly
(p < 0.01) decreased the expression of the p75MDM2 band.
Of relevance, the expression pattern of p75MDM2 was
similar to that observed for p21 protein in this cell-type
(Fig. 3A). Considering this relative to the ability of
p75MDM2 to inhibit the function of p90MDM2 [62] to promote
p21 degradation [56, 57], lower levels of p75MDM2 relative
to the control would, in theory, promote lower p21 protein
levels in MCF-7 cells, as shown in Fig. 3A.
A prominent band at approximately 23 kDa was
also detected with the MDM2 antibody in MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 4A), but does not correlate to any previously
reported MDM2 isoform [78], and its functional
significance remains unclear. Incubation of cells with
chelators significantly (p < 0.05) increased expression
of the 23 kDa band, whereas treatment with the DNAdamaging agent MC significantly (p < 0.01) reduced
its expression (Fig. 4A). Considering these latter
observations, this low Mr band could potentially be a
cleaved product of full-length p90MDM2, or its shorter
isoforms. Notably, this 23 kDa band was consistently
detected only in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A) and SK-N-MC
cells (Fig. 4D), but not the other cell lines, indicating its
expression was cell-type specific.
Assessing LNCaP cells, only the p75MDM2 and
MDM2
p90
isoforms were apparent (Fig. 4B). Densitometric
analysis demonstrated that over 3 experiments, 311
and Dp44mT had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on the
expression of both p75MDM2 and p90MDM2, while DFO
caused a slight, but not significant (p > 0.05) increase in
the expression of these isoforms relative to the control
(Fig. 4B). The response of these isoforms to DNAdamaging agents in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B) was similar
to that found for MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A), there being a
significant (p < 0.05) increase in the p75MDM2 and p90MDM2
isoforms in response to the DNA-damaging agents, Act D
and CP. On the other hand, MC had little effect relative
to the control in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B). It is evident that
the expression patterns of the proteins, p21 (Fig. 3B) and
p75MDM2 (Fig. 4B), was similar in LNCaP cells incubated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with chelators, or the DNA-damaging agents, Act D or
CP. Notably, a band above 90 kDa was also found in
this cell-type (Fig. 4B), but does not correlate to any
previously reported MDM2 isoforms [78], and was not
consistently observed. Therefore, it may be attributed to
non-specific binding of the MDM2 antibody. Furthermore,
a band which appeared at approximately 37 kDa (Fig. 4B)
was not always observed in repeat studies, and thus, was
not considered further.
Four MDM2 isoforms were identified in SKMEL-28 cells, namely p50MDM2, p60MDM2, p75MDM2 and
p90MDM2 (Fig. 4C). Incubation of SK-MEL-28 cells with
all chelators led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in
p75MDM2 relative to the control. This expression pattern
was similar to that observed for p21 in this cell-type
(Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the expression of p50MDM2,
p60MDM2 or p90MDM2 was not affected by the chelators in
these cells when compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4C).
Incubation of these cells with DNA-damaging agents led
to no significant (p > 0.05) alterations in the levels of
p50MDM2, p60MDM2 or p75MDM2. In contrast, following Act D
and CP treatment, there was a significant (p < 0.05)
reduction in the expression of the p90MDM2 isoform. Once
again, a non-specific band above 90 kDa was detected.
Examining SK-N-MC cells, both the p75MDM2
and p90MDM2 isoforms were detected (Fig. 4D). A band
correlating with p60MDM2 was inconsistently observed in
the blots for this cell line, and therefore, is not discussed
further. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the
expression of both the p75MDM2 and p90MDM2 isoforms
after incubation of SK-N-MC cells with chelators and
DNA-damaging agents relative to the control. However,
the p21 levels were not significantly altered in response
to chelators or DNA-damaging agents in this cell line
(Fig. 3E). This lack of effect on p21 expression could be
due to p75MDM2 (that may protect p21 from degradation)
and p90MDM2 (that degrades p21; [56, 57]) being both
significantly (p < 0.05) reduced to approximately the same
extent (Fig. 4D). In addition, as found in MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 4A), a 23 kDa band was also identified in SK-N-MC
cells (Fig. 4D). As similarly observed for MCF-7 cells,
a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the 23 kDa band was
observed in these cells when incubated with chelators and
CP, whereas a significant (p < 0.05) decrease was found
after incubation with MC (Fig. 4D).
Overall, there was a close correlation between the
expression of p21 and the p75MDM2 isoform in response
to Fe chelators in three of the cell-types investigated
(i.e., MCF-7 (r = +0.92), LNCaP (r = +0.92) and SKMEL-28 (r = +0.81)). This observation suggested that
one mechanism by which chelators may regulate p21
expression could potentially occur through regulating the
expression of p75MDM2. However, MDM2 expression did
not explain the response of the CFPAC-1 cells to chelators
and DNA-damage, as this protein was not detected in this
cell line. Hence, further experiments were conducted to

significantly (p > 0.05) altered by these agents (Fig. 5A).
This observation reflects the reduction in total p21
protein levels observed previously relative to the control
(Fig. 3A). The decrease of nuclear p21 in response to
these chelators is consistent with previous studies in
this cell line [71]. Assessing MCF-7 cells treated with
Act D, there was a significant (p < 0.001–0.05) increase
in p21 protein present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear
fractions relative to the control (Fig. 5A). Cells incubated
with CP demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in
cytoplasmic, but not nuclear p21, when compared to the
controls. In contrast to Act D and CP, incubation with MC
led to a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in nuclear levels
of p21 relative to the control (Fig. 5A). This finding was
consistent with the effects of MC on total p21 protein
expression (Fig. 3A).
In contrast to MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A), untreated
LNCaP cells expressed p21 at approximately equal levels
in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5B). Moreover,
following incubation of these cells with 311, Dp44mT or
DFO, there was no significant (p > 0.05) change in nuclear
or cytoplasmic p21 levels, which is in agreement with the
total p21 levels (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, a significant
(p < 0.001–0.05) up-regulation of p21 in both the cytoplasm
and nucleus was observed in LNCaP cells incubated with
all DNA-damaging agents (Fig. 5B) that was also in
correlation with total p21 expression (Fig. 3B).
Of all the cell lines utilized, SK-MEL-28 was the
only cell line, which had no detectable p21 expression
in the control cytosolic or nuclear fractions (Fig. 5C).
However, following incubation of these cells with 311
or DFO, nuclear p21 was significantly (p < 0.01–0.05)
increased, while cytoplasmic p21 levels were not markedly
affected. On the other hand, SK-MEL-28 cells incubated
with Dp44mT demonstrated significantly (p < 0.001–0.01)
higher levels of p21 protein in both the cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions relative to the control (Fig. 5C). The
DNA-damaging agents did not significantly (p > 0.05)
affect p21 expression in the cytoplasmic or nuclear
fractions of this cell line. These data were in agreement
with total p21 levels (Fig. 3C).
In CFPAC-1 cells incubated with control medium
alone, p21 expression was greater, but not significantly
(p > 0.05) different in the nuclear fraction relative to the
cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5D). As observed with total p21
levels (Fig. 3D), when CFPAC-1 cells were incubated with
chelators, there was a significant (p < 0.01) increase in p21
protein levels in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
compared with the controls. In contrast, after incubation
with DNA-damaging agents, there was no significant
(p > 0.05) change in cytoplasmic or nuclear p21 levels.
Data obtained from SK-N-MC cells showed
relatively equal amounts of p21 in both the cytoplasmic
and nuclear fractions, regardless of chelator treatment
(Fig. 5E). Furthermore, no significant (p > 0.05) alterations

Expression of ΔNp63 is not altered by chelators
or DNA-damaging agents in all cell-types
investigated
The p63 gene is a member of the p53 gene family
[82, 83]. It encodes multiple isoforms of p63 with a
variety of functions, some of which have been shown
to transactivate p53 target genes, including p21 [84].
However, the ΔNp63 isoform lacks the transactivation
domain and can act as a dominant negative regulator
to inhibit transactivation by p53 and p63, leading to
inhibition of target gene (e.g., p21) expression [60, 85,
86]. The over-expression of the ΔNp63 isoform has
previously been reported as a negative regulator of cyclindependent kinase inhibitors [59], including p21 [58, 61].
Hence, ΔNp63 expression in response to the chelators was
examined using an antibody specific for this particular
isoform to determine if it was involved in the response
of p21 to these agents (Fig. 3A–3E). Considering this,
western blot analysis was used to assess the potential
role of ΔNp63 in regulating p21 levels in all cell-types
examined herein (i.e., MCF-7, LNCaP, SK-MEL-28,
CFPAC-1 and SK-N-MC).
Two ΔNp63 bands were detected at approximately
63 kDa and 74 kDa in all cell lines assessed
(Fig. Supplemental 1). These two bands have been
previously reported as different isoforms of ΔNp63 [87,
88]. Densitometric analysis indicated that incubation with
chelators or DNA-damaging agents had no significant
(p > 0.05) effect on the expression of either the 63 or
74 kDa bands (Fig. Supplemental 1), this suggested that
the alterations in p21 observed in these cell-types were
independent of ΔNp63 expression.

Nuclear localization of p21 following
intracellular chelation and DNA-damage
Next, considering that the nuclear localization of
p21 is crucial for its inhibitory function [45], cytoplasmic
and nuclear fractionation studies were conducted to assess
the intracellular location of the p21 protein following
incubation of cells with chelators or DNA-damaging agents
(Fig. 5A–5E). Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was also
assessed to check the purity of the nuclear fractions and was
shown to be appropriate in all experiments (Fig. 5A–5E).
Examination of MCF-7 cells incubated with control
medium alone demonstrated that there was markedly
and significantly (p < 0.01) greater p21 levels in the
nuclear (N) fraction as compared to the cytoplasmic (C)
fraction (Fig. 5A). Moreover, relative to the control,
nuclear p21 levels were significantly (p < 0.001–0.05)
reduced by all chelators, while cytoplasmic p21 was not

of cells with chelators resulted in decreased total p21
protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas there was
an increase in p21 expression in SK-MEL-28 (Fig. 3C)
and CFPAC-1 cells (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, there
was no significant change in p21 protein levels after
incubation of LNCaP or SK-N-MC cells with the chelators
(Fig. 3B, 3E).
Despite that both MCF-7 and LNCaP cells have
wild-type p53 expression (Table 1), their responses to
chelators were markedly different, with MCF-7 cells
having reduced p21 expression, while there was no
significant change in total p21 protein in LNCaP cells.
This observation indicates that the effect of chelators
on p21 expression may not involve p53 and could be
occurring through other mechanisms. This was further
demonstrated by examining CFPAC-1 and SK-MEL-28
cells, where the chelators were able to markedly increase
p21 levels (Fig. 3C, 3D), despite both these cells having
mutated p53 (Table 1). Collectively, these data suggest that
the chelator-induced regulation of p21 does not correlate
with p53 status and is cell line-dependent.
In contrast to p21 protein levels, p21 mRNA
expression was consistently increased in each of the cell
lines examined in response to chelation (Fig. 2A–2E).
This indicates that p21 translation may potentially be
inhibited in some of these cells and warrants further
investigation. Alternatively, p21 could be regulated at
the post-transcriptional level by protein degradation [95].
In fact, Fu and Richardson [70] examined the downregulation of p21 following Fe-depletion in MCF-7
cells and demonstrated that it was due to: (1) inhibited
translocation of p21 mRNA from the nucleus to cytosolic
translational machinery; and (2) induction of ubiquitinindependent proteasomal degradation. Whether any of
these mechanisms are responsible for the failure of the
increased p21 mRNA to be translated to protein in LNCaP
and SK-N-MC cells after incubation with chelators is not
known.
Upon treatment of the five cell-types assessed herein
with DNA-damaging agents, p21 mRNA expression was
significantly up-regulated in all cell lines examined, except
after incubation of SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells with
Act D (Fig. 2A–2E). The increase in p21 mRNA levels
occurred irrespective of p53 status and suggested that the
DNA-damaging agents could up-regulate p21 mRNA by
a p53-independent mechanism. A paradoxical increase of
p21 mRNA (Fig. 2A) and decrease in protein expression
(Fig. 3A) was observed in response to the DNA-damaging
agent, MC, in MCF-7 cells. This trend was also observed
after incubation of SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells
with CP or MC (Fig. 2C, 2D and 3C, 3D). In the case of
MC, it has been reported that this agent also inhibits the
transcription of ribosomal RNA, which could significantly
decrease protein translation in MCF-7 cells [96] and may
explain the decreased p21 protein levels observed with this
agent.

were observed with the DNA-damaging agents compared
to the untreated control (Fig. 5E) in correlation with the
total p21 levels (Fig. 3E).
Immunofluorescence studies were then conducted
to further assess the cellular distribution of p21 in
the MCF-7 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines (Fig. 6A–6B).
These two cell lines were chosen as the focus for these
experiments because of their distinct expression of p21
protein in response to Fe chelator treatment, namely a
reduction in MCF-7 cells (Figs. 3A, 5A) and an increase
in SK-MEL-28 cells (Figs. 3C, 5C). Fig. 6A confirms
that the overall levels of p21 in the MCF-7 cell line
decrease upon treatment with chelators. These results
also demonstrate the increased levels and accumulation
of p21 in the nucleus of MCF-7 cells incubated with
the DNA-damaging agents, Act D and CP, which was
in agreement with the fractionation results in Fig. 5A.
On the other hand, there was a marked decrease in the
intensity of p21 expression after incubation with MC
(Fig. 6A) and this was consistent with the western analysis
(Fig. 3A, 5A). In agreement with the fractionation results
(Fig.  5C), immunofluorescence studies demonstrated
nuclear accumulation of p21 in SK-MEL-28 cells in
response to the chelators, but not in cells treated with the
DNA-damaging agents. In summary, there was a marked
difference in the expression levels and cellular distribution
of p21 depending upon the cell-type examined and also
the response of these cells to the chelators.

DISCUSSION
It has been reported that some cancer cells have
elevated p21 levels, while maintaining the ability to
rapidly proliferate [89–91]. In fact, cytoplasmic p21
expression is common in human malignancies and
correlates positively with aggressive tumors and poor
prognosis [92–94]. Considering that Fe is a new metabolic
target for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, with several
Fe chelators already entering clinical trials [9, 15, 16],
we assessed the effect of three of these agents compared
to DNA damaging agents on p21 expression. This is
important because Fe is known to be involved in the
progression of cells through the cell cycle by influencing
the expression of a variety of molecules involved in
cell cycle control, such as p21 and p53 [8–11]. These
studies were conducted in five different cancer cell lines,
two of which were expressing wild-type p53 (MCF-7
and LNCaP); two expressing mutant forms of p53 (SKMEL-28 and CFPAC-1); and one cell line that was p53
null (SK-N-MC; Table 1) [65–69].
Initial experiments demonstrated that chelators were
able to markedly up-regulate p21 mRNA levels, in all of
the cell-types examined (Fig. 2A–2E), regardless of their
p53 status. However, the expression of p21 protein in
response to chelator treatment did not correspond to its
mRNA levels in all cell lines examined. In fact, incubation

Recently, NDRG1 was found to up-regulate
p21 mRNA and protein in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer
cells and H1299 lung cancer cells, independently of p53
[41]. NDRG1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in
various cancers (for review see [97]) and has been shown
to be up-regulated in response to Fe chelator treatment in
a variety of cell-types [12, 41]. The increased expression
of NDRG1 in response to Fe-deprivation in all the cell
lines used in this investigation agreed with that previously
observed in prostate and lung cancer cell lines [41].
However, NDRG1 did not directly correlate with p21
protein expression in MCF-7, LNCaP, or SK-N-MC cells,
suggesting that alternative, NDRG1-independent pathways
could be involved in the chelator-mediated effects on p21
in these cell-types.
As previously mentioned, MDM2 has been reported
to regulate the expression of p21 independently of p53,
by directly promoting its proteasomal degradation [56,
57]. The many MDM2 isoforms arise through proteolytic
cleavage, post-translational modification, or alternative
splicing [78, 79]. Considering this, Cheng and Cohen [98]
reported that the p90MDM2 isoform is an un-conjugated fulllength MDM2 protein, whereas p75MDM2 is an N-terminal
truncated protein isoform. The over-expression of p75MDM2,
which cannot bind p53, has been found to interfere with
the ability of p90MDM2 to promote p53 degradation [62].
Several isoforms of MDM2 were identified in the cells
used in this investigation (Fig. 4A–4D). Of particular
interest, the p75MDM2 isoform showed a close correlation
to the expression of p21 in three of the five cell lines
examined under all treatment conditions. In this case, the
chelators appear to have activated the MDM2 promoter
independently of p53, resulting in the generation of the
p75MDM2 isoform, which may in turn interfere with the
ability of p90MDM2 to promote p21 degradation [56]. Besides
its effects on p53 and p21, full-length MDM2 has a number
of other oncogenic functions in cancer cells, which include
the alteration of cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and
metastasis [99, 100]. However, the exact mechanisms by
which chelators modulate MDM2 function are unknown
and further studies are required to elucidate how, and why,
particular isoforms are affected in response to Fe chelation.
Another member of the p53 family, p63, has also
been found to contain multiple isoforms with various
activities [83, 84]. The TAp63 isoform, which contains
the transactivation domain, has transcriptional activity and
transactivates p53 target genes such as p21 and MDM2
[83, 101]. The ΔNp63 isoform lacks the transactivation
domain and its over expression has previously been
reported as a negative regulator of p21 [58, 60, 61].
However, this study indicated that the alterations in
p21 observed in these cell-types were independent of
ΔNp63 expression, with no changes in ΔNp63 detected in
response to the chelators.
Finally, this investigation demonstrated that for
SK-MEL-28 and CFPAC-1 cells there was increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nuclear localization of p21 compared to cytosolic levels
in response to chelators. Given the inhibitory effects of
p21 when localized to the nucleus [45], which include
its cdk inhibitory function and promotion of cellular
senescence, the nuclear accumulation of p21 observed
could explain how chelators lead to G1/S arrest in these
cell-types [21, 25]. Considering that p21 can aid in
cell cycle progression by stabilising the interactions
between cyclins and cdks under certain conditions [45,
49, 50], the decrease in the endogenously high levels
of p21 in MCF-7 cells in response to chelators may
partially explain their anti-proliferative activity in this
cell line [23].
In conclusion, this study examined the mechanisms
involved in the chelator-mediated regulation of p21 in
five tumor cell lines. Overall, the results indicated that
chelators regulate p21 expression independently of p53
status and in a cell line-dependent manner. Furthermore,
we identified that the 75 kDa isoform of MDM2 (p75MDM2)
closely resembled the expression of p21 in response
to Fe chelators in three of the five cell lines examined,
suggesting that MDM2 may be involved in the regulation
of p21 protein in response to these agents.

METHODS
Cell culture
Cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; MD, USA). These include:
the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7; the androgensensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, LNCaP;
the human melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-28; the human
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, CFPAC-1;
and the neuroepithelioma cell line derived from a supra
orbital brain tumor, SK-N-MC. The MCF-7, SK-MEL-28
and SK-N-MC cell lines were maintained in Minimal
Essential Medium (MEM; Invitrogen; CA, USA). The
CFPAC-1 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), whereas the LNCaP
cell line was maintained in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute medium (RPMI; Invitrogen). All media was
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma
Aldrich; MO, USA), 100 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin/
glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids
(Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 0.28
ng/mL Fungizone™ (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at
37°C in 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator.

Cell treatments
Cells were treated with various chelators, including:
DFO (Novartis; Basel, Switzerland) at 250 μM, 311 at
25 μM, Dp44mT at 2.5 μM, and the DNA-damaging
agents, Act D at 5 nM (Sigma Aldrich; MO, USA);

(DAPI; Invitrogen). The slides were then analysed using a
Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescent microscope and images
were taken and analysed using Axiovision software (Carl
Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).

RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Densitometry was performed using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and normalised using
the relative β-actin loading control. Results are typical
of three to six independent experiments and presented
as mean ± S.D. Experimental data were compared using
the Student’s t-test. Results were considered statistically
significant when p < 0.05.

Densitometry and statistical analysis

RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent Solution,
following the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied
Biosystems; CA, USA). Reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed according to the
methodology described in [70] using the primers provided
in Supplementary Table 1.

were all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and
include: anti-rabbit IgG, anti-goat IgG and anti-mouse IgG
(1:10,000; Cat.#: A0545, A5420, A9917; Sigma Aldrich).
β-actin (1:10,000; Cat.#: A5316; Sigma Aldrich) was used
as a protein-loading control.
In some experiments, due to electrophoresis
hardware constraints, samples from one experiment were
required to be run on 2 gels at the same time. These were
then exposed equally under exactly the same conditions
at the same time. When this was done, a vertical line is
shown in the gel (i.e., see Fig. 5).
