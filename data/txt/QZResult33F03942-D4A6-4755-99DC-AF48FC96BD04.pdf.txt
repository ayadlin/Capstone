Abstract
The antineoplastic drug sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the serine-threonine kinase B-Raf
as well as several tyrosine kinases. Given the numerous
molecular targets of sorafenib, there are several potential
anticancer mechanisms of action, including induction of
apoptosis, cytostasis, and antiangiogenesis. We observed that
sorafenib has broad activity in viability assays in several
human tumor cell lines but selectively induces apoptosis in
only some lines. Sorafenib was found to decrease Mcl-1 levels
in most cell lines tested, but this decrease did not correlate
with apoptotic sensitivity. Sorafenib slows cell cycle progression and prevents irradiated cells from reaching and
accumulating at G2-M. In synchronized cells, sorafenib causes
a reversible G1 delay, which is associated with decreased levels
of cyclin D1, Rb, and phosphorylation of Rb. Although
sorafenib does not affect intrinsic radiosensitivity using
in vitro colony formation assays, it significantly reduces
colony size. In HCT116 xenograft tumor growth delay experiments in mice, sorafenib alters radiation response in a
schedule-dependent manner. Radiation treatment followed
sequentially by sorafenib was found to be associated with the
greatest tumor growth delay. This study establishes a
foundation for clinical testing of sequential fractionated
radiation followed by sorafenib in gastrointestinal and other
malignancies. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9443–54]

Introduction
Sorafenib was developed as a Raf kinase inhibitor that could
therapeutically target the mutated B-Raf oncogene in malignant
melanoma. Although sorafenib was not efficacious as a single agent
in melanoma therapy (1), early clinical trial data suggested
promising results in combination chemotherapy in melanoma
(2, 3). Surprisingly, sorafenib showed efficacy in renal cell cancer

and was approved in 2005 by the Food and Drug Administration as
standard therapy. The activity of sorafenib in renal cell cancer
seems related to an antiangiogenic effect likely due to its inhibitory
effect toward vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)
and their targets. In fact, sorafenib seems to target multiple
kinases, including c-Raf, wild-type and V599E mutant B-Raf,
VEGFR2, VEGFR3, Flt3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-h,
c-KIT, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, p38a, and RET. The
broad spectrum of kinase inhibitory activity of sorafenib supports
the idea that it may have activity in multiple tumor types possibly
when combined with other treatments.
To investigate the activity of sorafenib in gastrointestinal and
other tumors, we explored its effects on cell growth of multiple
human tumor cell lines. We observed a cell cycle inhibitory effect in
all human tumor cell lines tested as well as apoptosis in a subset
of lines. Detailed cell cycle analysis revealed that sorafenib causes
a delay in the G1 phase. Mechanistic studies revealed effects of
sorafenib on cyclin D1 and Rb expression. Because of the effect
of sorafenib in delaying early-phase cell cycle progression, we
hypothesized that either sorafenib pretreatment followed by
radiation or concurrent treatment may reduce the antitumor
effects of radiation therapy. We tested this hypothesis in animal
models using bioluminescence imaging and various schedules of
administration of sorafenib and radiation. Although concurrent
administration of sorafenib and radiation was not clearly inferior
in terms of in vivo antitumor effect, sequential treatment using
fractionated radiotherapy followed by sorafenib seemed to be the
optimal schedule for combined administration of these agents.
These studies lay the groundwork for clinical trials testing the
safety and efficacy of sorafenib combined with ionizing radiation in
gastrointestinal and other malignancies.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Sorafenib was synthesized as described previously (4). For cell
culture experiments, it was dissolved in DMSO to make a 32 mmol/L stock
solution and stored at 4jC. For mouse experiments, sorafenib was dissolved
in 1:1 cremophor EL (Sigma)/ethanol to make a 24 mg/mL solution. This
solution was freshly diluted each day to 6 mg/mL in sterile water. A stock
solution of 5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) in PBS was stored at 20jC. Solutions of 4 mg/mL
aphidicolin (Sigma) in DMSO were stored at 20jC.
Cell lines and tissue culture. Bax / HCT116 cells were provided by
Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; ref. 5) and
cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium. Other cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in the following media:
RPMI 1640 (H460 and SK-Br-3) McCoy’s 5A (HCT116, SKOV3, and U2OS),

Figure 1. Sorafenib inhibits colony
formation and prevents accumulation of
irradiated cells in G2-M. A and B, HCT116
and SW480 cells (400 per plate; n = 3) were
allowed to grow in either DMSO (0.05%) or
16 Amol/L sorafenib for 10 to 14 d and
colonies >50 cells were counted. Pretreatment
of SW480 cells with 16 Amol/L sorafenib for
18 h decreased plating efficiency by 44%
(P = 0.02). C, HCT116 (top ) or SW480
(bottom ) cells were grown to 70% confluence
and then treated with either DMSO (0.05%)
or sorafenib and incubated for 21 h. Cells
were either irradiated with 8 Gy or mock
treated and incubated for an additional 24 h.

and DMEM (Calu-6, MCF-7, RCC-4, SAOS-2, SK-Mel-2, SK-Mel-5, 786-0,
WT2, WM793B, and 293T). HCT116-Luc cells were created by infecting
HCT116 cells with a retrovirus encoding firefly luciferase under puromycin
selection, and pooled clones were used for the in vivo bioluminescence
xenograft experiments. Glioblastoma multiforme lines were obtained
from the University of California at San Francisco Brain Tumor Research
Center Tissue Bank (U-343, SF-268, and SF-767) and cultured in DMEM.
Except where serum-free conditions are indicated, complete medium is
defined as the appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). Human
umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained from Cambrex and cultured
in EGM-2 medium. Cells were cultured at 37jC in humidified 5% CO2/
95% air.
Synchronization. Exponentially growing cells were serum starved for
24 h (0% serum), then grown in the presence of 10% serum and aphidicolin
(2 Ag/mL) for 16 h, and then released into freshly added serum-containing
medium without aphidicolin.
MTT assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plates (2,000 per well) in
100 AL of serum-containing medium and allowed to grow for 1 day.
An additional 100 AL of serum-containing medium with various concentrations of sorafenib were added to yield final concentrations ranging from
125 nmol/L to 32 Amol/L. After 3 days, 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT were added

and incubated for 3 h. The supernatant was discarded, the precipitate was
dissolved in 200 AL DMSO, and plates were read with a microplate reader at
570 nm.
Colony formation assays. Cells were treated with trypsin to detach,
counted, and plated (400 per plate) into 60-mm dishes with either 0.05%
DMSO or 16 Amol/L sorafenib and allowed to grow for 10 to 14 days. Cells
were stained and colonies containing z50 cells were counted. In the
pretreatment experiment, cells were pretreated with 16 Amol/L sorafenib
for 18 h before trypsinization.
Cell cycle analysis. Floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed, and
stained with propidium iodide. Flow cytometry was done using a Beckman
Coulter Elite Epics sorter. The percentage of hypodiploid cells (sub-G1) was
used to quantify dead cells in apoptosis assays.
Tumor xenograft implantation in nude mice. Female NCR-nu/nu
mice were obtained from Taconic. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines using an approved protocol. At 5 to 7 weeks of age, mice were
injected with 2.8  106 HCT116-Luc cells suspended in 100 AL Matrigel
(BD Collaborative Research) solution in the bilateral posterolateral flanks.
Irradiation. Human tumor cells were irradiated with a Mark I cesium
irradiator (J.L. Shepherd) at a dose rate of 0.8 Gy/min. Tumor-bearing mice
were irradiated with a 250 kV orthovoltage irradiator (Philips RT 250)

through a 0.2-mm copper filter. The source-to-skin distance was 30 cm.
Lead was used to shield normal tissues where possible. Alternately, tumorbearing mice were irradiated with a 6 MV linear accelerator (Varian 6/100)
with 1 cm of bolus of tissue-equivalent material to allow for dose buildup.
The dose rate was 2.0 Gy/min with a source-to-bolus distance of 100 cm.
Collimators were used to shield normal tissues where possible.
Tumor regrowth delay. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with various
schedules of sorafenib and fractionated radiation. Tumors were measured
with calipers in two perpendicular diameters (a and b), and the volume was
calculated as V = [(a + b) / 2]3 / 2. Absolute growth delay (AGD) was defined
as the time required from day 0 ( first day of radiation) for the average
relative tumor volume to triple.
Bioluminescence imaging. Tumor-bearing mice were imaged twice
weekly using the Xenogen In vivo Imaging System. Mice were subjected to
imaging within 15 to 30 min after i.p. injection of D-luciferin (5 mg/mouse)
under anesthesia with i.p. ketamine/xylazine.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed on ice in reducing Laemmli sample
buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min, clarified by centrifugation, and
stored at 80jC. Samples containing equal amounts of total protein were
separated on NuPAGE 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting was done
with rabbit polyclonal anti-Mcl-1, anti-Rb (1:2,000), anti-phosphorylated Rb
(S807/811 and S795; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-cyclin
D1 (1:500; Calbiochem), mouse anti-p27 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse anti-p21 (1:250; Calbiochem), and mouse anti-Ran (1:5,000; BD
PharMingen). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent substrates
(Amersham Biosciences). For Ran detection, fluorochrome-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5,000) were used and detected by IR scanning
dosimetry using a Li-COR Odyssey Scanner.
Radiation survival studies. Cells were counted and variable numbers
ranging from 200 to 20,000 were plated in 60-mm dishes and allowed to
attach before irradiation. Colonies containing z50 cells were stained and

counted at 2 weeks after irradiation. The surviving fraction was determined
as the total number of colonies formed divided by the total number of cells
plated multiplied by the plating efficiency, as determined in unirradiated
cells in the presence or absence of drug exposure. Each point on the survival
curve represents the mean surviving fraction from at least three replicates
F SD.
The addition of sorafenib in relation to time of irradiation was carried
out according to three different sequences. (a) Short pretreatment: DMSO
or sorafenib was added after cells were attached and 2 to 3 h before
irradiation and medium was changed after an additional 24 h following
irradiation. (b) Long pretreatment: cells were treated with DMSO or
sorafenib for 24 h, trypsinized and counted, and then plated in the presence
of drug. The medium was replaced after an additional 24-h incubation
following radiation. (c) Posttreatment: DMSO or sorafenib was added within
2 to 3 min following radiation and medium was changed at 3 days following
radiation.

Results
Sorafenib has broad-spectrum antigrowth activity against
multiple human tumor cell lines and endothelial cells. Several
studies have shown antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of
sorafenib using short-term assays in multiple cell lines, including
colon (6), pancreas (6), melanoma (7, 8), leukemia (9, 10), thyroid
(11), malignant glioma (12), lung (13), breast (13), and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (9). Although sorafenib showed activity in
these multiple studies, we sought to establish the relative sensitivities using a simple assay (MTT) in a panel of tumor cell lines
derived from different tissues and to begin investigating the underlying mechanisms for growth inhibition. Viability following a 3-day
treatment with varying concentrations of sorafenib (125 nmol/L
to 32 Amol/L) was measured by the MTT assay, and the IC50s are

listed in Supplementary Table S1. There was little variation in sensitivity to sorafenib with IC50s ranging from 5 to 15 Amol/L, which
approximates clinically achievable serum concentrations (14) and is
in a similar range where apoptosis has been observed (8–10).

were observed in malignant glioma cell lines (12).

Others have found differences in sensitivity in melanoma cell
lines. Molhoek et al. (7) found that cell lines with mutant B-Raf
(V600E) were more sensitive to sorafenib in a growth inhibition
assay; however, the differences observed in sorafenib-dependent
apoptosis in three different melanoma lines were not dependent of
B-Raf mutational status (A375 cells are more resistant than A2058
cells; ref. 8). The minor difference observed in the melanoma cell

lines that we tested similarly did not follow B-Raf mutation status
(Supplementary Table S1).
To evaluate the combination of sorafenib and radiation, we evaluated the effects of duration of sorafenib exposure on colony survival. Long-term colony formation assays with 16 Amol/L sorafenib
in HCT116 and SW480 cells resulted in complete inhibition of colony formation (Fig. 1A and B). However, pretreatment for a limited

period with sorafenib reduced plating efficiency by 44% in SW480
cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of colony
formation in long-term colony-forming assays, but short treatment
at a relatively high dose can be used in this assay to assess for

radiosensitivity as described later. These results show a potent
growth-inhibitory effect of sorafenib toward multiple tumor cell lines,
but the underlying mechanism(s), which includes cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, or senescence, remained to be elucidated.

Figure 5 Continued. B, counted plates from A,
bottom , show that sorafenib-treated HCT116 cell
colonies are much smaller.

Sorafenib prevents accumulation of irradiated cells in G2-M.
To evaluate the effects of sorafenib on cell cycle phase distribution,
we treated HCT116 and SW480 with increasing doses of sorafenib
(Fig. 1C, top). Sorafenib up to 32 Amol/L had no apparent effect
on cell cycle distribution of these cells. To further evaluate the cell
cycle effects, we investigated the effects of sorafenib on unsynchronized, irradiated cells. To determine whether sorafenib could
affect radiation-induced cell cycle accumulation in G2-M, we pretreated cells with sorafenib for 24 h and then radiated cells with
8 Gy. After 24 h, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Interestingly,
whereas sorafenib had no effect on unsynchronized cell cycle distribution, there was a profound effect on G2-M accumulation (Fig. 1C,
bottom).
We evaluated the effects of sorafenib on the cell cycle distribution of several other tumor cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Consistent with the results in Fig. 1C, in the majority of tumor cell
lines (Bax / HCT116, HT29, SKOV3, and H460), there was no
apparent effect on cell cycle distribution following exposure to
sorafenib. In contrast, PC3 cells exhibited a G1 arrest similar to that
observed in T98G malignant glioma cells (12). Other lines (HeLa,
Calu-6, and U2OS) accumulated in S and G2 (Supplementary Fig.
S1). The ability of sorafenib to perturb the cell cycle may be related
to inhibition of Raf kinase; however, the pleomorphic phenotype
may be related to inhibition of other kinases in different cell lines.
The blockade of irradiated cells in G2-M by sorafenib in Fig. 1C
may be explained in one of two ways: (a) cells may have
accumulated at earlier phases of the cell cycles, preventing their
entry into G2-M, or (b) sorafenib may have suppressed the G2-M
checkpoint, allowing irradiated cells to exit mitosis. Based on the
results in Fig. 1C, we observed no obvious accumulation in G1 or S

www.aacrjournals.org

in HCT116 and SW480 cells, thereby favoring the second
explanation; however, we further tested these possibilities.
Kinetic analysis of synchronized cells reveals that sorafenib
slows progression through S phase to delay G2-M accumulation of irradiated cells. To assess whether reduced accumulation
of irradiated cells in G2-M following sorafenib treatment is due to
blockade of the G2-M checkpoint or prevention of cell cycle
progression, cell synchronization studies were done. In addition to
HCT116 cells, A549 cells, which have a robust and p53-independent
G2-M checkpoint, were studied (15, 16). We blocked HCT116 and
A549 cells at the G1-S boundary using serum starvation followed
by refeeding with serum-containing medium with aphidicolin. As
shown in Fig. 2, release from aphidicolin resulted in progressive
accumulation of cells in S and G2-M by 3 to 8 h and this was
followed by exit from mitosis by 25 h in HCT116 or earlier (by 13 h)
in A549 cells. Exposure to 8 Gy resulted in delayed exit from G2-M
in both HCT116 and A549 cells, consistent with the expected
checkpoint activation. In contrast to controls, sorafenib alone
prevented cells from progressing through S phase following
aphidicolin release. The combination of sorafenib and radiation
seemed to limit the accumulation of irradiated cells in G2-M. Few
synchronized HCT116 cells treated with both sorafenib and
radiation even made it to G2-M (Fig. 2, left), which likely accounts
for the lack of G2-M accumulation observed in Fig. 1C. A549 cells
were slightly more resistant to the sorafenib-induced cell cycle
slowing, and consequently, more cells treated with both sorafenib
and radiation reached G2-M (Fig. 2, right). Even in the presence of
sorafenib, irradiated A549 cells exhibited a G2-M checkpoint, which
argues against the hypothesis that sorafenib inhibits this checkpoint.

Figure 6. Sequential treatment with
radiation followed by sorafenib is more
effective than concurrent treatment of
HCT116 human colon tumor xenografts.
A, luciferase-expressing HCT116 tumors
(two tumors per mouse) were grown on the
backs of nude mice to an average size of
64 F 42 mm3. Mice were either untreated
(control, n = 10 tumors) or treated with 7 d
of daily sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d i.p.) from
day 3 to day +3 (sorafenib alone, n = 10
tumors), 4 d of daily radiation therapy
(300 cGy/fraction) from day 0 to day +3
[radiation (RT) alone, n = 8 tumors], or 7 d
of daily sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d i.p.) from day
3 to day +3 with 4 d of daily radiation
(300 cGy/fraction) from day 0 to day +3
with sorafenib given 75 min before daily
radiation (sorafenib + radiation, n = 8 tumors).
Tumor regrowth was measured by
caliper measurements and luciferase
bioluminescence. Tumor volumes from
each tumor were normalized to day 0 (first
day of radiation). Points, mean relative
tumor volumes over time; bars, SD.
Bioluminescence from each tumor was
normalized to day 0, and mean relative
bioluminescence over time is shown (error
bars omitted for clarity). Photographs with
color wash bioluminescence overlay are
shown from a representative mouse from
each group over time.

Sorafenib-induced G1-S delay is reversible. To test whether
sorafenib-induced G1-S accumulation (Fig. 2) represented a bona
fide arrest, we synchronized cells with sorafenib alone or with
aphidicolin followed by release into drug-free medium.
As in Fig. 2, aphidicolin-synchronized HCT116 cells refed
with complete medium reached G2-M by 7 h and reentered G1 at
18 h (Fig. 3A, first column). However, when HCT116 cells were
synchronized with aphidicolin and sorafenib, and then released
into complete medium, it took at least 26 h to reach G2-M, indicating a persistent delay, even in the absence of drug (Fig. 3A,
second column). If synchronized cells were maintained in sorafenib,
there was little progression (Fig. 3A, third column). If serum-starved
HCT116 cells were treated with sorafenib and aphidicolin (Fig. 3A,
fourth column), there was enrichment at G1 or G1-S compared with
asynchronous cells (Fig. 3A, top row, left). When ‘‘sorafenibsynchronized’’ cells were released into drug-free complete medium,
cell cycle progression was significantly delayed, with cells entering
S phase between 7 and 18 h and only reaching G2-M at 26 h (Fig. 3A,
fourth column). These results indicate cells were delayed in G1 or
G1-S and that the delay is slowly reversible. Similar observations
were made with U2OS osteosarcoma and SW480 colon cancer cells

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

(Fig. 3B and C), although there were differences. In the sustained
presence of sorafenib, a larger percentage of synchronized U2OS
cells progressed into S phase (Fig. 3B, third column) compared with
HCT116 cells continuously exposed to sorafenib. This may indicate
a difference in sensitivity to sorafenib-induced cell cycle delay
despite the observation that the IC50s for these cell lines were
similar as measured by the MTT assay (Supplementary Table S1).
Together, these results show that sorafenib delays cell cycle
progression in a variety of cell lines.
Sorafenib induces apoptosis in a cell line–dependent
manner. Sorafenib-induced cell cycle delay could account for the
activity in the MTT assay and colony formation assay. However, it
was possible that sorafenib caused cell death in addition to growth
delay, which was indicated by the presence of hypodiploid
populations, especially at later time points in Figs. 2 and 3. To
determine if the activity of sorafenib in the viability and colony
formation assays was due to cytotoxicity or cytostasis, we further
evaluated a panel of cell lines for cell death on exposure to
sorafenib by sub-G1 analysis (Fig. 4A). Sorafenib induced death in a
concentration-dependent manner in HCT116, U2OS, and 786-0
cells, whereas minimal cell death was observed in SW480, RCC-4,

Sorafenib/Radiation Combination Therapy

Figure 6 Continued. B, luciferaseexpressing HCT116 tumors (two tumors
per mouse) were grown on the backs
of nude mice to an average size of
287 F 98 mm3. Mice were treated with
either 7 d of vehicle (vehicle, n = 10
tumors), 7 d of daily sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d
i.p.) from day 0 to day +6 with 3 d of daily
radiation (250 cGy/fraction) from day 0 to
day +2 with sorafenib given 12 h before
daily radiation (concurrent sorafenib +
radiation and then sorafenib, n = 8 tumors),
3 d of daily radiation (250 cGy/fraction)
from day 0 to day +2 followed by 7 d of daily
sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d i.p.) from day +3 to
day +9 (sequential radiation and then
sorafenib, n = 8 tumors), 3 d of daily
radiation (250 cGy/fraction) from day 0
to day +2 (radiation alone), or 7 d of
daily sorafenib (60 mg/kg/d i.p.) from day 0
to day +6 (sorafenib alone, n = 10 tumors).

and H460 cells. This difference in susceptibility to drug-induced
apoptosis did not correlate with p53 status or activated Ras
mutational status. The observation that sorafenib only induces
apoptosis in certain cell lines points to the importance of the effect
of sorafenib on the cell cycle.
Serum-induced levels of cyclin D1, phosphorylated Rb, and
p27 are inhibited by sorafenib. To further characterize the
observed cell cycle delay, we examined the expression of cell cycle
regulatory proteins in synchronized cells treated with sorafenib.
Cells were serum starved and then either synchronized with
aphidicolin or released into serum F sorafenib (Fig. 4B). In human
foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) and SW480 cells, treatment with
sorafenib decreased levels of cyclin D1. Decreased cyclin D1 may
result in decreased cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase 2–dependent
Rb phosphorylation. Although sorafenib apparently blocks Rb
phosphorylation at S807/811 and S795 in both HFF and SW480
cells, sorafenib also decreased total levels of Rb, especially in
fibroblasts. Blockade of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway may increase levels of p27, but sorafenib did
not reliably increase p27 levels. The observed changes in these
proteins are consistent with cell cycle perturbation but not
complete arrest. If hypophosphorylated Rb and p27 had accumulated with concurrent loss of cyclin D1, one would predict a G1

www.aacrjournals.org

arrest. However, sorafenib decreased levels of cyclin D1, total Rb,
and phosphorylated Rb consistent with G1 delay and preserved
ability to slowly enter S phase. Why sorafenib-treated cells are
delayed in S phase is unknown.
To test whether decreased cyclin D1 is responsible for growth
inhibition by sorafenib, cell lines defective in cyclin D1 degradation
were tested (Fig. 4C). KYSE30 cells express cyclin D1a, which is
normally degraded and served as a control (17). KYSE70 cells
predominantly express cyclin D1b (17), a splice variant resistant to
degradation. Similarly, TE7 cells have mutant cyclin D1, P287A,
which cannot be phosphorylated on T286, a signal for degradation
(18). Both KYSE70 and TE7 cells have cyclin D1 isoforms that are
resistant to degradation and would be expected to be resistant to
sorafenib if reduction of cyclin D1 were the key mechanism of
action. As shown in Fig. 4C, even when cyclin D1 is stabilized, the
cells are sensitive to growth inhibition by sorafenib, suggesting that
targets other than cyclin D1 are important. It is also possible that
sorafenib targets cyclin D1 synthesis. In either case, these data
suggest that sorafenib would be effective even in cancers with
stabilized cyclin D1.
Sorafenib decreases the number and size of surviving
colonies but does not alter the shape of the radiation doseresponse curve. The effects of cell cycle–active agents on

radiosensitivity are complex, but it is generally accepted that cells
in G1 and early S phase are more radiosensitive than those in late S
(19). Because sorafenib inhibits radiation-induced G2-M accumulation, most likely by causing delays in progression through earlier
phases of the cell cycle, we tested sorafenib in radiation survival
assays. The schedule of sorafenib and radiation treatment was
varied in in vitro radiation survival assays (Fig. 5A). To test cell
cycle phase-independent effects, cells were treated for 2 to 3 h with
sorafenib before radiation and then removed 1 to 2 days after
radiation (Fig. 5A, top). Although treatment with sorafenib reduced
plating efficiency in some cell lines, this short pretreatment did not
affect the relative surviving fraction. To test the effect of cell cycle
accumulation, cells were pretreated with sorafenib for 24 h before
radiation followed by continued exposure to sorafenib for an
additional 24 h (Fig. 5A, middle). Longer pretreatment reduced the
plating efficiency of HCT116 and SW480 cells but did not affect the
relative surviving fraction. Finally, treatment with sorafenib for
48 h after radiation decreased the plating efficiency but did not
radiosensitize the cells (Fig. 5A, bottom). Together, these results
contrast the observation that antisense RNA to Raf-1 radiosensitizes but are consistent with observations that inhibitors of
MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), the
kinase downstream of Raf, have not been shown to radiosensitize
(20). Although sorafenib did not synergize with radiation as
measured by normalized colony number, sorafenib treatment
resulted in dramatically smaller colonies (Fig. 5B). Although
colony-forming assays did not show synergy, it is possible that
sorafenib may sensitize cells to radiation-induced apoptosis.
Cancer cell lines that were either sensitive (HCT116 and U2OS)
or resistant (SW480 cells) to sorafenib-induced apoptosis were
tested for sensitization to radiation-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). None of these cell lines showed appreciable levels
of radiation-induced apoptosis regardless of sorafenib pretreatment. Despite the apparent lack of synergy in these in vitro assays,
it is possible that sorafenib could potentiate the radiation
antitumor effect in vivo, as sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor
with antiangiogenic effects (21). This possibility was further tested.
Sorafenib enhances the antitumor effect of radiation in a
schedule-dependent manner in human tumor xenografts.
Because sorafenib is expected to have effects on the tumor
microenvironment as a result of its antiangiogenic properties (21),
we evaluated the ability of sorafenib to affect radiosensitivity in a
nude mouse xenograft model. Luciferase-expressing HCT116
tumors were grown on the backs of nude mice, which were either
not treated, treated with 7 days of sorafenib (60 mg/kg), radiated
with four daily fractions of 300 cGy/fraction starting on day 0, or
pretreated with 3 days of sorafenib followed by concurrent
treatment with sorafenib administered 75 min before radiation
treatments for 4 days. Tumor growth delay was monitored by
tumor volume and tumor bioluminescence. As can be seen in
Fig. 6A, sorafenib alone minimally increased the AGD from 6.7 to
7.7 days. Pretreatment followed by concurrent treatment with
sorafenib resulted in more rapid regrowth (AGD, 18.8 days) than
radiation alone (AGD, 21.9 days). In Fig. 6B, alternate sequences
were tested, namely concurrent treatment with sorafenib and
radiation for 3 days followed by sorafenib for 4 days (AGD, 20.8
days) or sequential treatment with 3 days of radiation followed by
7 days of sorafenib (AGD, 25.0 days). Compared with vehicle (AGD,
10.1 days), radiation alone for 3 days (AGD, 17.5 days), or sorafenib
alone for 7 days (AGD, 13.4 days), sequential treatment delayed
tumor growth the most as determined by tumor volume. As

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

determined by relative tumor bioluminescence, the sequential
schedule seemed to delay tumor regrowth the most, whereas
concurrent treatment with radiation and sorafenib was no better
than radiation alone (Fig. 6B). Thus, regardless of sequence,
concurrent treatment with sorafenib is no better than radiation
alone. Alternatively, sequential sorafenib treatment following
radiation increases the effectiveness of either treatment alone.
The effectiveness of sequential radiation following sorafenib
treatment is unknown.

Discussion
We report the cell cycle and antitumor effects of a combination
of sorafenib and radiation and establish the optimal schedule for
coadministration in vivo. We unravel several previously unappreciated effects of sorafenib on cell growth inhibition, including a
G1-S cell cycle delay in synchronized cells, and effects on serumstimulated cyclin D1 and Rb accumulation. Our studies highlight
the importance of careful synchronization in delineating cell cycle
effects. Sequential treatment with radiation followed by sorafenib
had the greatest in vivo antitumor effect, showing the importance
of treatment schedule. These results provide a rationale for
combination treatment with sorafenib and radiation as well as a
preferred schedule of administration.
Sorafenib is broadly active in multiple cell lines regardless of
histology, Ras, or Raf mutational status. Although selected normal
cell lines were sensitive to sorafenib in vitro, tumor-bearing
patients and animals treated with sorafenib have tumor shrinkage
with minimal toxicity, indicating that the therapeutic index is wide
in vivo. In melanoma cell lines, mutant B-Raf (V600E) predicts
sensitivity to MEK inhibitors (22) and sorafenib (7). Unlike Molhoek
et al. (7) who used lower concentrations and a short (1 h) treatment time in a sensitive growth inhibition, we did not find that
B-Raf mutational status affected sensitivity to sorafenib in the
MTT assay. The MTT assay measures both cell growth and death,
and others have shown that sorafenib-dependent apoptosis is not
due to Raf mutational status, pointing to alternate targets in the
determination of sorafenib sensitivity (8). Others have shown the
importance of decreased Mcl-1 levels in sorafenib-dependent
apoptosis (9, 10). We also found that sorafenib decreased Mcl-1
levels in most cell lines tested (Supplementary Data). Interestingly,
we found that sorafenib-dependent apoptosis was cell line
dependent but did not correlate with decreases in Mcl-1. The use
of sorafenib to target Mcl-1 can help guide combination therapies.
For example, it would be interesting to combine ABT-737 with
sorafenib as down-regulation of Mcl-1 is synergistic with ABT-737,
an inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (23). Sorafenib may sensitize cells
to the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (24). Sorafenib has shown preclinical
synergy with other ‘‘biological’’ antitumor agents, such as inhibitors
of mammalian target of rapamycin (7), protein kinase Cy (12), and
the proteasome (13). Interestingly, sorafenib has shown synergy
with SN-38, an active metabolite of CPT-11, but antagonism with
other classic antineoplastic drugs, including paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and platinum-containing drugs (25, 26). The
antagonism of sorafenib with platinum-containing compounds
was hypothesized to be either from decreased uptake of the
platinum drugs or an antagonistic effect on the cell cycle (25).
The effect of sorafenib on the cell cycle may in part be explained
by inhibition of Raf kinase. Signaling through the MAPK pathway
leads to expression of cyclin D1, phosphorylation of Rb, and
ultimately progression through the G1-S checkpoint. Targeted

inhibition of the MAPK pathway would be expected to lead to a G1
block, but this was not consistently observed. We observed that
sorafenib causes no obvious arrest in the majority of asynchronous
cell lines but causes a G1, S, or G2 arrest in some cell lines.
Consistent with a cell line–dependent effect, it has been observed
that, in the glioblastoma cell line T98G, sorafenib causes a timeand concentration-dependent G1 arrest with a decrease in cyclin
D1 levels (12). A targeted MEK inhibitor, CI-1040, leads to a G1
arrest of asynchronous cells with decreased levels of cyclin D1, but
this occurs preferentially in cells with mutant B-Raf (22). It is
possible that cell lines with mutant B-Raf would have a similar
effect when treated with sorafenib. The effect of sorafenib on the
cell cycle becomes most obvious when cells are synchronized or
cotreated with an agent that causes cell cycle blockade, such as
ionizing radiation. Heim et al. (25) found that sorafenib blocked the
G2 arrest induced by cisplatin as well as the G1 arrest induced by
oxaliplatin while decreasing levels of cyclin D1 and p21. The
heterogeneous effects on cell cycle progression may be more
consistent with multiple targets rather than mediated solely
through Raf inhibition.
The in vivo antitumor effects of sorafenib combined with
radiation yielded the surprising result that sequential treatment of
sorafenib following radiation was superior to concurrent treatment.
The effects of a radiosensitizing agent can be divided into intrinsic
effects and microenvironmental effects. Based on colony formation
assays, sorafenib and radiation cooperated to yield fewer and
smaller colonies, but there was not true synergistic radiosensitization. There may have been balanced competing effects of
antagonism due to cell cycle delay, allowing more time for repair
of sublethal damage and sensitization through effects on
potentially lethal damage repair. The latter may be expected from
effects on survival pathways, such as Mcl-1, analogous to the
radiosensitization caused by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Akt pathway (27). Effects on the tumor microenvironment
are best tested with in vivo models. Agents that target tumor
vasculature and angiogenesis are generally additive or supraadditive when combined with radiation (28). Although sorafenib
has antiangiogenic activity, concurrent treatment with radiation
was no better than radiation alone, whether it was given with a
‘‘run in’’ (Fig. 6A) or ‘‘run out’’ (Fig. 6B). It is possible that an
antagonistic cell cycle effect counteracted any beneficial effect
from antiangiogenesis or blocking of survival pathways. Clearly,

both radiation and sorafenib treatment are effective antitumor
treatments, which was noted in vitro by the decreased size of the
sorafenib-treated colonies in the colony formation assays and
in vivo by the observation that sequential treatment was effective.
Although we found that the sequential schedule had more
antitumor activity than radiation alone or concurrent treatment,
the optimal schedule of sequential treatment remains an open
question. Sorafenib treatment followed by radiation sequentially
was not tested, and it would be of interest to compare this schedule
with radiation first followed by sorafenib (Fig. 6B). It may be that
sorafenib inhibition of angiogenesis following radiation was
effective by inhibiting proliferation of endothelium damaged by
radiation. Alternately, the antiangiogenic effect of pretreatment
with sorafenib may be superior by improving tumor oxygenation
and thus radiosensitivity, similar to what is observed with antiVEGF antibody pretreatment (29).
This study establishes a preferred schedule for combining sorafenib
with clinical radiotherapy. Based on our in vivo data, because
sorafenib and radiation seem to have the greatest antitumor effect
when administered in sequence, clinical trials with concurrent
sorafenib and radiation are not warranted at this time. When the
toxicities of sorafenib are considered (i.e., diarrhea and skin reactions),
the safety of combination treatment with 5-FU–sensitized radiation
for gastrointestinal malignancies should be cautiously studied.
Sequential treatment with radiation and then sorafenib seems to be
superior to concurrent treatment. In preoperative regimens with
concurrent chemoradiation for gastrointestinal malignancies (i.e.,
rectal and esophageal cancer), there is usually a period of at least
4 weeks between chemoradiation and surgery. The window between
chemoradiation and surgery may be an opportune time to introduce a
targeted agent such as sorafenib that is well tolerated to maximize
antitumor effect. We are developing a phase I/II trial in preoperative
rectal adenocarcinoma with toxicity and pathologic complete
response rate as primary end points.
