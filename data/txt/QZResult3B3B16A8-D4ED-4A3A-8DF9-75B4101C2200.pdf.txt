BACKGROUND. The prognostic accuracy for distant recurrence-free survival using
a 21-gene reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay underwent validation in 668 lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive women
with early-stage breast cancer receiving tamoxifen on National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast Program (NSABP) B-14. The predictive accuracy for treatment efficacy also

underwent validation in 651 patients randomized on NSABP B-20 and 645
patients on NSABP B-14.

METHODS. Patients were classified as high (recurrence score [RS]  31), intermediate (RS 18–30), or low (RS < 18) risk for distant recurrence at 10 years. Costeffectiveness ratios were estimated for RS-guided treatment compared with either
tamoxifen alone or the combined chemotherapy and tamoxifen.
RESULTS. Distant recurrence was reported in RS low-risk, intermediate-risk, and
high-risk patients at 10 years in 3.7%, 17.8%, and 38.3% receiving tamoxifen
alone and 5.0%, 10.1%, and 11.1% receiving the chemotherapy and tamoxifen.
RS-guided therapy is associated with a gain in individual life expectancy of 2.2
years compared with tamoxifen alone, whereas it is associated with similar life
expectancy to that seen with the chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategy. RSguided therapy is estimated to provide a net cost savings of $2256 compared
with chemotherapy and tamoxifen with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of
$1944 per life year saved compared with tamoxifen alone.

CONCLUSIONS. Treatment decisions based on RS-guided therapy compared with
tamoxifen alone are associated with greater efficacy with acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios, and associated with similar efficacy and lower cost compared
with chemotherapy and tamoxifen for patients with lymph node-negative,

ore than 200,000 women are diagnosed with invasive breast
cancer in the US annually, with approximately 40,000 dying
from the disease, with nearly half of these women presenting with
lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive disease.1 The decision to treat early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) with adjuvant hormonal therapy and/or chemotherapy is based on several clinical and
pathological criteria. Current guidelines for the management of
patients with ESBC recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for the majority of women with lymph node-negative,
hormone receptor-positive ESBC.2,3 Unfortunately, systemic chemotherapy is associated with considerable immediate morbidity and

cost along with increasing evidence for significant
delayed toxicities such as neurocognitive dysfunction
and secondary malignancies.
Many patients with lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive ESBC do not experience distant recurrences or death from breast cancer even in
the absence of adjuvant chemotherapy. At the same
time, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated
that some patients develop distant recurrence despite
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.4 Due in large part to
the limited ability of clinical criteria to accurately
assess an individual’s risk, many patients continue to
be overtreated or undertreated. Interest has recently
developed in the possible role of gene expression profiles and other molecular techniques in more accurately
assessing the risk of recurrence and the impact of treatment to guide clinical decisions on adjuvant therapy.5
A gene expression profile assay has been developed based on reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods that permit quantification of gene expression in fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.6 Candidate genes consisted of 250
cancer-related genes gathered from the cancer literature, genomic databases, and microarray data.7–10 A
21-gene expression signature including 16 functional
and 5 references genes was found to provide excellent RT-PCR performance. Prognostic information
was obtained on 447 women with ESBC including
233 from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Program (NSABP) Study B-20 in whom archived tissue
was available.11 A recurrence score (RS; Oncotype
DX) ranging from 0–100 was derived from each
patient’s gene expression results using a proprietary
formula. This 21-gene signature has been independently validated as a prognostic indicator of distant
recurrence-free survival in 668 evaluable patients in
node-negative, receptor-positive ESBC receiving tamoxifen on the NSABP B-14 study.12–15 Multivariate
analysis demonstrated this assay to be a significant
independent prognostic factor for distant recurrence
after adjustment for age and tumor size with an
adjusted hazard ratio of 3.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23, 4.61; P < .00001).11
A previous economic analysis based on the initial
validation of the prognostic capability of the assay
has been reported.16 A cost-utility analysis was conducted using the RS in patients classified as having a
low or high risk of distant recurrence based on
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
clinical guidelines. The analysis considered survival,
quality of life, and costs from a societal perspective.
At baseline values, the RS applied to 100 potential
patients predicted an increase quality-adjusted survival by 8.6 years while reducing overall costs by

$202,828. The RS was more accurate than NCCN
guidelines as an indicator of prognosis for lymph
node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive ESBC and
was cost effective.16 The predictive accuracy of the
21-gene signature has recently been validated based
on the observed impact of chemotherapy and tamoxifen on distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS)
among 651 patients on NSABP B-20 and 645
patients on NSABP B-14.17 The study reported here
incorporates the extended validation results into an
economic model of the 21-gene expression signature
to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in patients with lymph node-negative,
estrogen receptor-positive ESBC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Risk Assessment
As noted above, the original validation study of prognostic accuracy for the 21-gene expression signature
was based on women with lymph node-negative,
estrogen receptor-positive ESBC treated with tamoxifen on NSABP B-14. Of the 2617 eligible women,
688 were evaluable based on availability of the original tumor block and adequate tumor to provide RNA
for RT-PCR analysis.11 The predictive accuracy for
DRFS based on response to chemotherapy and tamoxifen has also undergone validation in 651 patients
randomized on NSABP B-20 and 645 patients on
NSABP B-14.17 An RS was generated as a continuous
measure by fitting a time-varying piece-wise log-hazard
ratio model to the data, whereas the 10-year distant
recurrence rate was estimated by a Breslow-type estimator as previously described.18 Women with nodenegative, receptor-positive ESBC were classified as high
(RS  31), intermediate (RS 18–30), or low (RS < 18)
risk of distant recurrence at 10 years (Fig. 1).11
Outcome Measures
The clinical impact of different treatment strategies
was assessed by estimating the gain in life expectancy or life years saved derived from NSABP B-20
and B-14. The impact of treatment strategies on
health-related quality of life was based on a time
trade-off method where patients are asked to state
the maximum number of years of their actual life expectancy in the diseased state that they would be
willing to give up for time in full health. This method
is based on the premise that many patients would be
willing to give up some length of survival for a higher
quality of survival if that was a viable option. Clinical
outcomes were expressed in the form of qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) by taking the product of
the actual life expectancy and the patient utility.

reported Average Wholesale Price and include only
drug costs. Other treatment-related direct and indirect costs were not considered, eg, costs of administration, testing, transportation, etc. Utility estimates
for the quality of life impact of adjuvant beast cancer
chemotherapy were derived from the literature as
described above.20,21 Costs not considered in this
analysis include both additional direct costs associated with drug administration, professional fees,
and laboratory testing along with indirect costs such
as transportation and loss of productivity costs and
patient out-of-pocket expenses.

Data on costs of cancer care were obtained from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as
well as published literature and are described else-

Cost Effectiveness and Cost Utility
A clinical decision model was developed comparing
clinical, economic, and quality of life outcomes for 3
adjuvant treatment strategies: 1) tamoxifen alone, 2)
chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen, or 3) RSguided therapy based on the results of the 21-gene
RT-PCR assay. The RS-guided strategy employs tamoxifen for low-risk patients and chemotherapy and
tamoxifen for intermediate- and high-risk patients.

tions. Treatment strategies were compared in the framework of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses
providing summary outcome measures reflecting
additional cost of 1 strategy over another (marginal
cost) and the additional clinical benefit (marginal efficacy) or quality-adjusted clinical benefit (marginal
utility). The balance between cost and benefit was
expressed in terms of cost-effectiveness (C/E) and
cost-utility (C/U) ratios of the marginal cost and the
marginal effectiveness representing the added cost
per life year or QALY saved.22–24 Incremental costs
($), life years, QALYs, as well as C/E and C/U ratios
were estimated for each treatment strategy.

Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation was conducted for DRFS
and estimated costs based on available distributions.
Sampling distributions and summary estimates of
cost, efficacy, and variance were based on 1000 replicates.

RESULTS
Risk Stratification
Of the 651 patients on NSABP B20 with corresponding gene expression assays, 64 (9.83%) developed distant recurrence including 31 (13.66%) randomized to
tamoxifen and 33 (7.78%) receiving chemotherapy
and tamoxifen. Distant recurrence was observed
within 10 years in 3.2%, 9.1%, and 39.5% of RS lowrisk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively, receiving tamoxifen alone and in 4.4%, 10.9%,
and 11.9% in those receiving chemotherapy and tamoxifen. No significant difference in life expectancy
at 10 years was seen between the RS-guided therapy
and the combined chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategies, whereas RS-guided therapy is associated with
a gain in individual life expectancy of 2.2 years compared with tamoxifen alone.

FIGURE 2. Graphical display of the expected costs of treatment by strategy for increasing costs associated with chemotherapy. The comparative
drug costs estimated for 5 commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens
are indicated including: 1) doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) every 3
weeks 3 4 cycles; 2) AC every 2 weeks 3 4 cycles with colony-stimulating
factor (CSF) support; 3) AC followed by paclitaxel (AC-T) every 3 weeks 3 8
cycles; 4) AC-T every 2 weeks 3 8 cycles with CSF support; and 5) docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) every 3 weeks 3 6 cycles
with CSF support.

Expected Costs
Under baseline cost assumptions, the lowest expected
overall cost is associated with treatment with tamoxifen alone, whereas the greatest expected cost is that
associated with the chemotherapy and tamoxifen
strategy (Table 2). The expected costs of each strategy increase as the cost of treating distant recurrence
increases. Above a cost of treating recurrence of
$100,759, RS-guided therapy provides a net cost savings compared with other strategies and is always
cost-saving compared with the chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategy. Tamoxifen is associated with lowest
costs for all reasonable follow-up cost assumptions
among those not recurring, whereas RS-guided therapy is always associated with lower costs than a
chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategy.
The expected costs associated with both the
chemotherapy and tamoxifen and the RS-guided
therapy strategies increase as the direct cost of
chemotherapy increases, but they do so at different
rates. As shown in Figure 2, the expected costs favor
the RS-guided therapy strategy over the chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategies, for total chemotherapy
costs exceed $5822. The estimated costs associated
with 5 commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens are indicated including: 1) doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) every 3 weeks 3 4 cycles; 2)
AC every 2 weeks 3 4 cycles with colony-stimulating
factor (CSF) support; 3) AC followed by paclitaxel

weeks 3 8 cycles with CSF support; and 5) docetaxel,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) every 3
weeks 3 6 with CSF support. Whereas every 3-week
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide without myeloid
growth factor support is associated with a lower cost,
most of the commonly used adjuvant breast cancer
regimens are associated with costs that favor their targeted use based on the 21-gene expression signature. A
net cost savings is estimated for RS-guided therapy for:
AC-T Q3 weeks ($458); AC Q2 weeks ($946); AC-T Q2
weeks ($5159), and TAC Q3 weeks ($9810).

Incremental Cost-Effectiveness
The expected incremental costs associated with the
RS-guided therapy and chemotherapy and tamoxifen
strategies are $4272 and $6527, respectively, compared with tamoxifen alone (Table 2). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with tamoxifen
alone favors the RS-guided therapy strategy ($1944/
life year saved) over the chemotherapy and tamoxifen approach ($3385/life year saved). Incremental life
years saved for the RS-guided therapy compared
with tamoxifen alone increases as healthy life expectancy increases, whereas the cost effectiveness
decreases from $41,433/life year saved at a healthy
life expectancy of 5 years to $1101/life year saved
with a life expectancy of 40 years to chemotherapy
and tamoxifen with varying healthy life expectancy.
Cost Utility
The baseline assumptions indicated in Table 1 reflect
no adjustment for the impact of chemotherapy on
quality-of-life. Such adjustments have the anticipated
effect on the estimated QALYs and, therefore, the
cost utility or cost per QALY gained. Expected QALYs

were found to favor the RS-guided therapy strategy
over chemotherapy and tamoxifen for all values of
health utility, with increasing incremental QALY as
the impact of chemotherapy on measured utility
increased. The utility associated with chemotherapy
has no impact on the expected QALYs associated
with the tamoxifen-alone strategy. Greater expected
QALYs compared with tamoxifen alone are seen for
RS-guided therapy until the utility associated with
chemotherapy falls below 0.80. At a utility of 0.90
associated with adjuvant chemotherapy, RS-guided
therapy is associated with a gain of 0.97 QALYs and a
cost utility of $4432/QALY compared with tamoxifen
alone and a gain in 1.71 QALYs compared with the
chemotherapy and tamoxifen combination despite a
net cost savings.

Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation was conducted as described
above. Mean and median incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $2769/life year saved and $1784/life
year saved, respectively, for RS-guided therapy compared with tamoxifen alone. As shown in the costeffectiveness scatterplot (Fig. 3), the RS-guided therapy and the chemotherapy strategies are associated
with quite separate distributions of costs and effectiveness compared with that associated with tamoxifen alone. Assessment of the incremental costeffectiveness ratios demonstrate that the relation
between RS-guided therapy and tamoxifen alone is
primarily that of an increase in life years saved,
albeit with a small increase in cost resulting in costeffectiveness ratios with a very high probability of
falling below $50,000/life year saved (Fig. 4). An

assessment of the incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios for the relation between RS-guided therapy
and the chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategy
demonstrates that the RS-guided therapy reduces the
estimated cost with an actual reduction in cost in
70% of replicates in Monte Carlo analysis and an
overall benefit in terms of life expectancy. In a willingness-to-pay (WTP) analysis (data not shown),
under baseline conditions and a WTP value ¼ 0, the
tamoxifen-alone arm is favored by virtue of being the
least costly option. The RS-guided therapy option
becomes equally favored at a WTP of $7500/life year
saved. The chemotherapy and tamoxifen strategy is
equally favored compared with tamoxifen at a WTP
of $13,000, whereas the RS-guided therapy remains
the favored option approximately 70% of the time
when the WTP exceeds $15,000/life year saved.

DISCUSSION
Treatment decisions based on the RS-guided therapy
compared with tamoxifen alone are associated with
greater efficacy, with cost-effectiveness ratios well
within accepted ranges for technology adoption,
whereas they are associated with similar efficacy and
substantially lower toxicity and cost compared with
chemotherapy and tamoxifen for all patients. Decisions on the adjuvant treatment of women with
ESBC are often based on patient age or menopausal
status as well as clinical and pathological factors
associated with limited prognostic accuracy.25,26 Multiple large, randomized, controlled trials and metaanalyses of those trials have demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant systemic therapy in ESBC. Nevertheless, systemic chemotherapy is associated with
short-term as well as long-term toxicities of considerable concern. As a result, many patients receive
potentially toxic adjuvant chemotherapy who are already disease-free, whereas some do not receive
potentially curative adjuvant therapy who might have
benefited. Current clinical guidelines encourage the
use of adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to hormonal therapy in all but the lowest risk categories of
lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive
women with ESBC.2,3 The 21-gene expression signature RS for distant disease recurrence was initially
validated in 668 evaluable lymph node-negative,
estrogen receptor-positive ESBC patients receiving
tamoxifen on NSABP B-14.11 More recently, the predictive accuracy of the assay has also been validation-based on the response to chemotherapy and
tamoxifen in 651 patients on NSABP B-20 and 645
patients on NSABP B-14.17 The study reported here
was undertaken to further evaluate the economic

impact of the 21-gene signature when used to guide
common clinical decisions concerning the use of
adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy in
patients with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive ESBC. The economic impact of the gene
expression profile signature to guide the type of
adjuvant systemic therapy was compared with the
strategy of tamoxifen alone or chemotherapy and
tamoxifen.
Under baseline assumptions, the lowest expected
cost was found to be associated with tamoxifen
alone, whereas the RS-guided therapy strategy was
associated with lower expected costs than the chemotherapy strategy. The estimated incremental cost
with RS-guided therapy and chemotherapy compared
with tamoxifen alone was $4272 and $6527, respectively. An estimated average cost savings of more
than $2000 was estimated for RS-guided treatment.
The estimated incremental cost per life year saved
compared with tamoxifen alone favored RS-guided
therapy over the chemotherapy strategy, with a cost
saving of over $1000 per life year saved with RSguided therapy. The RS-guided therapy strategy was
found to be more costly for low-cost chemotherapy
regimens not requiring additional supportive care,
whereas a net cost savings between $500 and $10,000
is estimated with RS-guided therapy for other commonly used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. The
estimated cost savings provided here for RS-guided
therapy are probably underestimates, as they do not
consider other direct costs associated with adjuvant
chemotherapy including drug administration, professional fees, laboratory testing and the costs of complications. In addition, the model does not consider
indirect costs such as those associated with transportation and loss of productivity costs as well as outof-pocket expenses. Therefore, it is likely that additional savings from a societal perspective would be
associated with the RS-guided therapy strategy.
Several studies have addressed the potential
impact of cancer chemotherapy on patient quality of
life.27–31 Whereas no quality of life adjustment was
considered under baseline conditions, the greater the
impact of chemotherapy on quality of life, the
greater the incremental cost utility favoring RSguided therapy compared with systemic chemotherapy. Likewise, RS-guided therapy was associated with
superior cost utility compared with tamoxifen alone
for chemotherapy utility exceeding 80%.
Despite the favorable clinical and economic
results for the 21-gene assay presented here, it is
clear that more work is needed to develop assays
with both greater accuracy as well as broader clinical
application. As with this assay, careful and compre-

hensive validation of assays with potential use in
estimating disease prognosis and treatment response
in women with ESBC is needed.32–35 A recent review
of 17 studies of gene expression assays with validation based on recurrence-free survival in women
with ESBC in a broad range of potential clinical settings demonstrates wide variation in test accuracy.36
Assay performance measures including sensitivity
and specificity varied widely across studies. Of
potential interest for investigators in future studies is
the observed significant correlation between the
number of genes in the assay and test performance
as reflected in the diagnostic odds ratio. As gene
expression assays and other biomarkers improve in
prognostic and predictive accuracy, further increases
in the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of these
tools should be achieved.
In summary, RS-guided therapy applied to lymph
node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive ESBC is
associated with lower expected cost per life year or
QALY gained compared with empiric chemotherapy
across all reasonable model assumptions. The use of
the gene expression assay in targeting systemic
chemotherapy and hormonal therapy toward ESBC
patients at greatest risk and most likely to benefit
appears to have the potential to provide a net cost
savings or to prolong survival along with acceptable
cost-effectiveness ratios compared with other commonly used adjuvant treatment strategies. Nevertheless, further evaluation of the clinical utility of gene
expression profile signatures in women with ESBC is
needed. A large Phase III trial (TAILORx) sponsored
by the National Cancer Institute is currently being
conducted assigning lymph node-negative, estrogen
receptor-positive women with breast cancer hormonal therapy if RS < 11, combination of adjuvant
chemotherapy and hormonal therapy if RS > 25, and
randomizing patients with RS 11–15 to either hormonal therapy or combination chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. This study will hopefully further
define the potential role of the 21-gene expression
assay in women with intermediate RS results.
